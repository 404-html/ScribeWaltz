1
00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:07.910
<v Speaker 1>So Jamie Vernon has some facebook stock</v>
<v Speaker 1>for sale.</v>

2
00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:13.640
<v Speaker 1>He's got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's uploaded it to Craig's slowly take</v>

3
00:00:13.641 --> 00:00:15.050
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take it off my hands.</v>

4
00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.960
<v Speaker 1>I think it will bounce back if you guys</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know what we're talking about.</v>

5
00:00:17.961 --> 00:00:20.900
<v Speaker 1>Facebook a apparently Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were the one who first told me about</v>

6
00:00:20.901 --> 00:00:22.080
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you fill people in?</v>

7
00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:25.070
<v Speaker 1>From what I saw,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something going on like the</v>

8
00:00:25.071 --> 00:00:29.090
<v Speaker 1>company's called Cambridge Analytica,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which uh,</v>

9
00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:32.420
<v Speaker 1>what I've also then learned is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>Steve Bannon used to be the vp of this</v>

10
00:00:32.421 --> 00:00:34.880
<v Speaker 1>company,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that was before he was in the trump</v>

11
00:00:34.881 --> 00:00:38.210
<v Speaker 1>campaign.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they are responsible for scraping</v>

12
00:00:38.211 --> 00:00:39.920
<v Speaker 1>millions of users.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Personal information,</v>

13
00:00:39.921 --> 00:00:42.890
<v Speaker 1>I think through a couple apps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe like the,</v>

14
00:00:42.891 --> 00:00:45.200
<v Speaker 1>like a personality APP.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If someone took one of a personality</v>

15
00:00:45.201 --> 00:00:46.034
<v Speaker 1>quiz,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

16
00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.020
<v Speaker 1>Those online quizzes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Polls,</v>

17
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.260
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But let's be,</v>

18
00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.900
<v Speaker 1>those are morons that answer those</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

19
00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:55.940
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For the most part where people that are</v>

20
00:00:55.941 --> 00:00:58.370
<v Speaker 1>super bored and that's how you get most</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the time,</v>

21
00:00:58.371 --> 00:00:59.570
<v Speaker 1>how you get your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your facebook,</v>

22
00:00:59.571 --> 00:01:01.580
<v Speaker 1>like passwords stolen is from those</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

23
00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:05.720
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or from sneaky emails that tell you your</v>

24
00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.740
<v Speaker 1>account's been compromised,</v>
<v Speaker 1>please reenter your password and you</v>

25
00:01:08.741 --> 00:01:11.150
<v Speaker 1>know they were doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

26
00:01:11.151 --> 00:01:16.151
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't say facebook on the url.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can be sneaky with their urls to</v>

27
00:01:16.191 --> 00:01:19.070
<v Speaker 1>like put something in front of it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then facebook and you're like,</v>

28
00:01:19.071 --> 00:01:20.240
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it looks like facebook.</v>

29
00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:25.190
<v Speaker 1>You know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the FTC is looking into this case</v>

30
00:01:25.191 --> 00:01:29.210
<v Speaker 1>right now apparently as of yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what I read is they face up to</v>

31
00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.240
<v Speaker 1>potentially $40,000 fine for every</v>
<v Speaker 1>infraction,</v>

32
00:01:32.241 --> 00:01:34.460
<v Speaker 1>which would total over two million two</v>
<v Speaker 1>trillion dollars,</v>

33
00:01:34.461 --> 00:01:35.900
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a t trillion.</v>

34
00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.980
<v Speaker 1>So it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's their stock has tanked.</v>

35
00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.460
<v Speaker 1>I think it was like 8% yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's at eight and a half so far today</v>

36
00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.080
<v Speaker 1>it's down to $165 a share.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like 185 two days ago.</v>

37
00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:50.540
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then a lot of people that are also</v>

38
00:01:50.541 --> 00:01:53.030
<v Speaker 1>not talking about just getting rid of</v>
<v Speaker 1>their facebook account altogether.</v>

39
00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.300
<v Speaker 1>I talked about this last night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm on the actual fence of doing that</v>

40
00:01:56.301 --> 00:01:59.600
<v Speaker 1>just because I can't take it anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the only place I go to where it's</v>

41
00:01:59.601 --> 00:02:01.340
<v Speaker 1>just I get annoyed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get in fights,</v>

42
00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:04.070
<v Speaker 1>I have to see my sister talk about trump</v>
<v Speaker 1>every day.</v>

43
00:02:04.071 --> 00:02:05.000
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's just,</v>

44
00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:10.120
<v Speaker 1>I get it just upsetting now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very good forum for people that</v>

45
00:02:10.461 --> 00:02:13.910
<v Speaker 1>are into political arguments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like political arguments,</v>

46
00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.670
<v Speaker 1>gay rights arguments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of like,</v>

47
00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.970
<v Speaker 1>that's like one of the last places where</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's okay to say that you don't think</v>

48
00:02:19.971 --> 00:02:21.770
<v Speaker 1>gay people should be married.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

49
00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:24.540
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

50
00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:25.580
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

51
00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:27.800
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just know some people that are</v>

52
00:02:27.801 --> 00:02:29.570
<v Speaker 1>probably shouldn't know anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

53
00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:30.980
<v Speaker 1>And occasionally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

54
00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.910
<v Speaker 1>we're all my real facebook page,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I never go to.</v>

55
00:02:34.911 --> 00:02:36.890
<v Speaker 1>Like if I go to it once a year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a lot.</v>

56
00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:38.930
<v Speaker 1>And that's where all the fake news stuff</v>
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

57
00:02:38.931 --> 00:02:41.930
<v Speaker 1>Like I thought Pam Anderson died the</v>
<v Speaker 1>other day and it was just one of those</v>

58
00:02:41.931 --> 00:02:44.240
<v Speaker 1>fake news stories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's always where you find it is</v>

59
00:02:44.241 --> 00:02:46.670
<v Speaker 1>on facebook.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whenever you go and read an article and</v>

60
00:02:46.671 --> 00:02:48.620
<v Speaker 1>those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those two things at the bottom that</v>

61
00:02:48.621 --> 00:02:50.600
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should see what she looks like now.</v>

62
00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.180
<v Speaker 1>And there's like 30 of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like wait a minute.</v>

63
00:02:53.181 --> 00:02:55.490
<v Speaker 1>Like they just throwing shit at you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

64
00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.080
<v Speaker 1>They just literally like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come on,</v>

65
00:02:57.081 --> 00:02:58.790
<v Speaker 1>you're going to bite on one of these.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come on.</v>

66
00:02:58.791 --> 00:03:00.280
<v Speaker 1>What is it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kevin Costner.</v>

67
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.760
<v Speaker 2>You can't believe what he looks like now</v>
<v Speaker 2>you remember that girl from precious.</v>

68
00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.080
<v Speaker 2>You can't believe it often.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does it work though?</v>

69
00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:07.920
<v Speaker 2>Check.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So every so often right now I don't need</v>

70
00:03:07.921 --> 00:03:10.480
<v Speaker 2>more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I take got me a few times in the early</v>

71
00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:11.310
<v Speaker 2>days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Google it.</v>

72
00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I thought that those were below c.</v>

73
00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:17.170
<v Speaker 2>It's a sneaky thing because they took</v>
<v Speaker 2>the place of real stories.</v>

74
00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:20.230
<v Speaker 2>It's like it used to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go to CNN and everything would be</v>

75
00:03:20.231 --> 00:03:22.120
<v Speaker 2>cnn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but now you go to CNN,</v>

76
00:03:22.121 --> 00:03:26.770
<v Speaker 2>everything's CNN up a dual line and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>below the line it's like sponsored</v>

77
00:03:26.771 --> 00:03:27.521
<v Speaker 2>content.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like wait,</v>

78
00:03:27.521 --> 00:03:27.821
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>

79
00:03:27.821 --> 00:03:28.151
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>

80
00:03:28.151 --> 00:03:28.870
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait.</v>

81
00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.230
<v Speaker 2>This isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is so sneaky cause this is barely</v>

82
00:03:32.231 --> 00:03:35.140
<v Speaker 2>an ad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is like an article on CNN that</v>

83
00:03:35.141 --> 00:03:39.280
<v Speaker 2>takes you to some new place and every</v>
<v Speaker 2>page,</v>

84
00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:43.150
<v Speaker 2>like you have to keep changing pages.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And every page is like one paragraph,</v>

85
00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:47.190
<v Speaker 2>like one paragraph on what Kevin Costner</v>
<v Speaker 2>looked like in 1980 okay.</v>

86
00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.980
<v Speaker 2>What about 81 boom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Next page in [inaudible] 81 Kevin</v>

87
00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:51.970
<v Speaker 2>Costner started to gain weight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>

88
00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:53.920
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there's usually not the photo</v>

89
00:03:53.921 --> 00:03:56.530
<v Speaker 2>that you want to see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know how like the thumbnail has like</v>

90
00:03:56.531 --> 00:03:58.270
<v Speaker 2>Kevin Costner head blown apart and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

91
00:03:58.271 --> 00:04:00.000
<v Speaker 2>I want to see that picture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>

92
00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:01.930
<v Speaker 2>it's not even in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fake.</v>

93
00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:07.090
<v Speaker 2>Some these sons of bitches clickbait</v>
<v Speaker 2>that insists that and snapchat,</v>

94
00:04:07.091 --> 00:04:09.860
<v Speaker 2>I think it should go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I might be out done with this to the</v>

95
00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:11.290
<v Speaker 2>snapchat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rihanna,</v>

96
00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:16.330
<v Speaker 2>Chris Brown thing is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fact that somebody green lit that it</v>

97
00:04:16.331 --> 00:04:19.720
<v Speaker 2>costs them almost a billion dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like instantly,</v>

98
00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:24.580
<v Speaker 2>weren't they down like some $800 million</v>
<v Speaker 2>or some fucking insane number?</v>

99
00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:25.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that was,</v>

100
00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.520
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The second time that's happened in a</v>

101
00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:28.270
<v Speaker 2>couple of weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

102
00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:30.520
<v Speaker 2>One of them was like Kylie Jenner saying</v>
<v Speaker 2>it sucks.</v>

103
00:04:30.521 --> 00:04:32.190
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The current action.</v>

104
00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:36.580
<v Speaker 2>So 800 million,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they dropped after Rihanna condemned ad</v>

105
00:04:36.581 --> 00:04:37.990
<v Speaker 2>making light of domestic violence.</v>

106
00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:42.910
<v Speaker 2>So the question was in the poll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would you rather slap Rihanna or punched</v>

107
00:04:42.911 --> 00:04:44.500
<v Speaker 2>Chris Brown?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what would you,</v>

108
00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:45.880
<v Speaker 2>what would you look at this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at that.</v>

109
00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:50.180
<v Speaker 2>Of course everyone wants a punched,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like who wants the slippery on it?</v>

110
00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:54.850
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of dudes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of assholes out there.</v>

111
00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:59.440
<v Speaker 2>There's got to be probably a sizeable</v>
<v Speaker 2>percentage of the people clicked slap</v>

112
00:04:59.441 --> 00:05:01.030
<v Speaker 2>Rihanna just cause they don't like their</v>
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

113
00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:04.210
<v Speaker 2>Well woke the beach.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would like to see that.</v>

114
00:05:04.211 --> 00:05:06.760
<v Speaker 2>What the results were of this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

115
00:05:06.761 --> 00:05:10.720
<v Speaker 2>Well you would have to join the band and</v>
<v Speaker 2>administration and then they get you</v>

116
00:05:10.721 --> 00:05:14.180
<v Speaker 2>involved in Cambridge analytics and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got to give up your fingerprints.</v>

117
00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:19.240
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how anybody could say yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put that on snapchat.</v>

118
00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:23.590
<v Speaker 2>Like that seems so fucking insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That seems like a joke,</v>

119
00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:25.480
<v Speaker 2>like in a movie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

120
00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:28.270
<v Speaker 2>like can you talk about like a clueless</v>
<v Speaker 2>executive,</v>

121
00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:29.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like this is my idea.</v>

122
00:05:29.981 --> 00:05:31.420
<v Speaker 2>What do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lots of clicks,</v>

123
00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:32.860
<v Speaker 2>lots of clicks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

124
00:05:32.861 --> 00:05:36.100
<v Speaker 2>cut to him with a sad face holdings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>boxes,</v>

125
00:05:36.101 --> 00:05:39.610
<v Speaker 2>stuff as he's being kicked out of his</v>
<v Speaker 2>office and stay out.</v>

126
00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:40.973
<v Speaker 2>You know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

127
00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:45.820
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't seem like something that</v>
<v Speaker 2>something is huge as snapchat.</v>

128
00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:47.460
<v Speaker 2>How could they do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

129
00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:49.480
<v Speaker 2>they've been fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the whole redesign they did</v>

130
00:05:49.481 --> 00:05:51.850
<v Speaker 2>recently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It already was confusing and annoying to</v>

131
00:05:51.851 --> 00:05:54.580
<v Speaker 2>begin with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but don't use it at all now it's even</v>

132
00:05:54.581 --> 00:05:56.140
<v Speaker 2>worse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like every,</v>

133
00:05:56.141 --> 00:05:57.980
<v Speaker 2>they even had a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

134
00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:59.450
<v Speaker 3>a website where,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

135
00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:00.950
<v Speaker 3>every,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a petition to the,</v>

136
00:06:00.951 --> 00:06:03.890
<v Speaker 3>to switch back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they got up to a million users</v>

137
00:06:03.891 --> 00:06:05.690
<v Speaker 3>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we want the old snapchat back.</v>

138
00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:06.620
<v Speaker 3>And they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

139
00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:07.670
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's better now.</v>

140
00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:08.960
<v Speaker 3>We're in not listening to you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

141
00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:10.343
<v Speaker 3>well instagram</v>

142
00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:11.090
<v Speaker 1>listened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

143
00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:14.210
<v Speaker 1>They went back to things being in</v>
<v Speaker 1>chronological order.</v>

144
00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:15.540
<v Speaker 1>Did they do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

145
00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:17.190
<v Speaker 1>it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the tested it.</v>

146
00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:19.850
<v Speaker 1>I was like a Beta test.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It hasn't happened for everyone yet,</v>

147
00:06:19.851 --> 00:06:22.250
<v Speaker 1>but it probably will happen or it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to become an option soon.</v>

148
00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:24.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody likes this nonsense.</v>

149
00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:27.080
<v Speaker 1>I'll look at my feed from real recent</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it says,</v>

150
00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:28.580
<v Speaker 1>I'll look at someone's post.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll say,</v>

151
00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:31.820
<v Speaker 1>this is yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I look at the time it says 26</v>

152
00:06:31.821 --> 00:06:32.511
<v Speaker 1>hours ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

153
00:06:32.511 --> 00:06:34.610
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hate that.</v>

154
00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:36.860
<v Speaker 1>Why are you showing me something from a</v>
<v Speaker 1>day ago?</v>

155
00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:37.251
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

156
00:06:37.251 --> 00:06:40.400
<v Speaker 3>or I'm going to be here tonight and that</v>
<v Speaker 3>was from like three days ago already.</v>

157
00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:43.250
<v Speaker 1>This concert I've ever seen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This joe just came out recently.</v>

158
00:06:43.251 --> 00:06:44.830
<v Speaker 1>This snapchat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

159
00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:47.400
<v Speaker 1>opened up their map.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's called the snap map.</v>

160
00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:48.291
<v Speaker 1>So that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that word,</v>

161
00:06:48.291 --> 00:06:50.870
<v Speaker 1>the hot zones are where snaps are taking</v>
<v Speaker 1>place right now.</v>

162
00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:55.550
<v Speaker 1>What the universal stories basically</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a stalker map for people that don't</v>

163
00:06:55.551 --> 00:06:57.530
<v Speaker 1>have everything private.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like this is universal studios,</v>

164
00:06:57.531 --> 00:06:59.690
<v Speaker 1>so it's a hot zone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the Hollywood and highland hot</v>

165
00:06:59.691 --> 00:07:02.810
<v Speaker 1>zone over here in Ucla.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hodson where the kids are,</v>

166
00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:05.600
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can like watch where trends are,</v>

167
00:07:05.601 --> 00:07:07.670
<v Speaker 1>things are happening while they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>happening and whatnot.</v>

168
00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.690
<v Speaker 1>Makes Sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that they can track that.</v>

169
00:07:11.691 --> 00:07:13.220
<v Speaker 1>And those spots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would assume,</v>

170
00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:14.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Disneyland,</v>

171
00:07:14.271 --> 00:07:15.620
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's gotta be a hot zone.</v>

172
00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:17.840
<v Speaker 1>Like anywhere there's a giant population</v>
<v Speaker 1>area.</v>

173
00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:19.850
<v Speaker 1>But what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know what the fuck a snap</v>

174
00:07:19.851 --> 00:07:21.380
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it just like a picture?</v>

175
00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:24.560
<v Speaker 1>Just like instagram.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like instagram second picture or</v>

176
00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:27.260
<v Speaker 1>video or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it goes away if you want it to.</v>

177
00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:28.550
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't have to anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It used to,</v>

178
00:07:28.551 --> 00:07:29.400
<v Speaker 1>I used to be the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

179
00:07:29.401 --> 00:07:31.790
<v Speaker 1>just disappeared.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

180
00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:35.390
<v Speaker 1>But everyone competed and so now they</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to keep it around.</v>

181
00:07:35.391 --> 00:07:35.700
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

182
00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:38.280
<v Speaker 3>So funny how privacy is changed over the</v>
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>

183
00:07:38.281 --> 00:07:42.240
<v Speaker 3>Remember aol one or two where it used to</v>
<v Speaker 3>have member directory where you just</v>

184
00:07:42.241 --> 00:07:46.140
<v Speaker 3>type in your address and will show you</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the users near your house and then</v>

185
00:07:46.141 --> 00:07:48.480
<v Speaker 3>you could just instant message these</v>
<v Speaker 3>people out of the blue and go,</v>

186
00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:50.070
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I you look cute.</v>

187
00:07:50.071 --> 00:07:51.960
<v Speaker 3>I lived down the street from you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You want to hook up?</v>

188
00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:55.200
<v Speaker 3>Like that's how like they even showed</v>
<v Speaker 3>where you were.</v>

189
00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:56.320
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

190
00:07:56.321 --> 00:07:59.110
<v Speaker 1>yesterday with Kurt Metzger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were talking about Barry crimmins.</v>

191
00:07:59.111 --> 00:08:00.360
<v Speaker 1>How Barry Crimmins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

197
00:08:14.681 --> 00:08:19.681
<v Speaker 1>his battle with AOL where AOL was</v>
<v Speaker 1>allowing people to trade child porn and</v>

198
00:08:20.561 --> 00:08:25.120
<v Speaker 1>they had a policy where if three strikes</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're out so you could trade trade</v>

199
00:08:25.121 --> 00:08:26.800
<v Speaker 1>child porn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>call me lucky.</v>

200
00:08:26.801 --> 00:08:30.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could trade child porn three times</v>

201
00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:33.460
<v Speaker 1>like and it's fucking insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he,</v>

202
00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:37.240
<v Speaker 1>he actually was a big part of that trial</v>
<v Speaker 1>and bringing it to trial.</v>

203
00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thing is insane that that wasn't</v>

204
00:08:40.601 --> 00:08:42.940
<v Speaker 1>that long ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was 20 years ago.</v>

205
00:08:42.970 --> 00:08:46.930
<v Speaker 1>20 years ago you could trade child porn</v>
<v Speaker 1>on AOL.</v>

206
00:08:47.410 --> 00:08:49.220
<v Speaker 1>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She like,</v>

207
00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:51.220
<v Speaker 1>and if you got caught they just said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

208
00:08:51.221 --> 00:08:54.550
<v Speaker 1>don't do that again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like now they come to your fucking house</v>

209
00:08:54.551 --> 00:08:58.320
<v Speaker 1>and they lock up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's really interesting how much</v>

210
00:08:58.321 --> 00:09:00.480
<v Speaker 1>that's advanced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

211
00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:02.780
<v Speaker 1>this is what I was going to show you</v>
<v Speaker 1>guys a second ago.</v>

212
00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:06.440
<v Speaker 1>I just saw a story yesterday that never</v>
<v Speaker 1>before the thought I funds could be</v>

213
00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:08.100
<v Speaker 1>cracked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now this company has this little</v>

214
00:09:08.101 --> 00:09:09.480
<v Speaker 1>box,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which uh,</v>

215
00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:12.180
<v Speaker 1>there's a picture right here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not that expensive.</v>

216
00:09:12.181 --> 00:09:15.590
<v Speaker 1>$15,000 gets the police,</v>
<v Speaker 1>300 uh,</v>

217
00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:19.680
<v Speaker 1>licensed unlocks and then they can spend</v>
<v Speaker 1>double and Gav unlimited unlocks and it</v>

218
00:09:19.681 --> 00:09:24.090
<v Speaker 1>will unlock every iphone and newer than</v>
<v Speaker 1>an iphone five s it said it.</v>

219
00:09:24.091 --> 00:09:27.180
<v Speaker 1>Their pricing structure is weird because</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you get the 15,001,</v>

220
00:09:27.181 --> 00:09:30.390
<v Speaker 1>you're only allowed to do it at a</v>
<v Speaker 1>location that's like Geo fenced in.</v>

221
00:09:30.391 --> 00:09:31.890
<v Speaker 1>You're not allowed to do it anywhere</v>
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>

222
00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:32.351
<v Speaker 1>Hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>

223
00:09:32.351 --> 00:09:35.340
<v Speaker 1>Can you just said newer than an iphone</v>
<v Speaker 1>five s it can five,</v>

224
00:09:35.341 --> 00:09:37.990
<v Speaker 1>five s and newer and newer up up to</v>
<v Speaker 1>right now,</v>

225
00:09:37.991 --> 00:09:40.430
<v Speaker 1>like you just have a five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>

226
00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:43.440
<v Speaker 1>Would it be the older operating system?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we're going to talk about with</v>

227
00:09:43.450 --> 00:09:46.080
<v Speaker 1>that with phones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you might not be able to use those</v>

228
00:09:46.081 --> 00:09:46.800
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

229
00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:49.620
<v Speaker 1>it's just so convenient to do things on</v>
<v Speaker 1>your phone.</v>

230
00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:51.930
<v Speaker 1>That's part of the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'd take taking the doing</v>

231
00:09:51.931 --> 00:09:53.460
<v Speaker 1>lately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>using apple pay,</v>

232
00:09:53.461 --> 00:09:54.570
<v Speaker 1>the grocery store,</v>

233
00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:56.610

<v Speaker 1>It's very exciting.</v>

234
00:09:56.611 --> 00:09:59.130
<v Speaker 1>It's like I'm living in the future.</v>

<v Speaker 1>into it,</v>

240
00:10:09.421 --> 00:10:11.460
<v Speaker 1>so you could just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are just using your iphone is on</v>

241
00:10:11.461 --> 00:10:11.730

00:10:11.730 --> 00:10:12.720
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

243
00:10:13.290 --> 00:10:16.200
<v Speaker 1>$20 device you get on Amazon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy,</v>

244
00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:18.330
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>With your Imac is good too.</v>

245
00:10:19.010 --> 00:10:21.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's your I Mac,</v>

246
00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:23.520
<v Speaker 1>if you buy something on your Imac and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's linked to your phone,</v>

247
00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:25.410
<v Speaker 1>it'll just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you wanna use apple pay and then you</v>

248
00:10:25.411 --> 00:10:28.890
<v Speaker 1>pull out your phone and confirmed well</v>
<v Speaker 1>on my laptop,</v>

249
00:10:28.891 --> 00:10:32.190
<v Speaker 1>but it's a fingerprint I don't have for</v>
<v Speaker 1>like for apple pay.</v>

250
00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:33.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

251
00:10:33.061 --> 00:10:35.640
<v Speaker 1>That's retina scans be paid with your</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apple Watch though.</v>

252
00:10:35.641 --> 00:10:38.880
<v Speaker 1>Like a pimp yet cheese.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's too much.</v>

253
00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:43.050
<v Speaker 1>So I mean like this is gotta be</v>
<v Speaker 1>escalating,</v>

254
00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:43.811
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was.</v>

255
00:10:43.811 --> 00:10:46.350
<v Speaker 1>So the people that are sitting back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the forecasters,</v>

256
00:10:46.351 --> 00:10:48.600
<v Speaker 1>they're looking like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is technology going to be in 10</v>

257
00:10:48.601 --> 00:10:50.700
<v Speaker 1>years?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what are they saying?</v>

258
00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:52.830
<v Speaker 1>What's their predictions?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because this is a,</v>

259
00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:56.640
<v Speaker 1>it's getting into your body somehow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's coming in one of the holes.</v>

260
00:10:56.670 --> 00:10:59.970
<v Speaker 1>It's like a dude right now rubbing his</v>
<v Speaker 1>dick on the outside trying to find a</v>

261
00:10:59.971 --> 00:11:00.840
<v Speaker 1>place to stick it in.</v>

262
00:11:01.170 --> 00:11:05.080
<v Speaker 1>He's got it on your wrist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's got it in your pocket and he's,</v>

263
00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:08.190
<v Speaker 1>he's trying to get it into,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your body's got it in your ears.</v>

264
00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:09.270
<v Speaker 1>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're putting,</v>

265
00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:12.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>earbuds in like those airpods said it</v>

266
00:11:12.351 --> 00:11:15.090
<v Speaker 1>best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You do fucking Siri with a double tap</v>

267
00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:17.580
<v Speaker 1>and your airpods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It knows when you're taking him out of</v>

268
00:11:17.581 --> 00:11:19.830
<v Speaker 1>your ear so it pauses your music or</v>
<v Speaker 1>videos.</v>

269
00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:23.070
<v Speaker 1>It's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're incredible and they don't fall</v>

270
00:11:23.071 --> 00:11:24.990
<v Speaker 1>out when you work out either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought that was gonna be a problem.</v>

271
00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:27.240
<v Speaker 1>We're not as good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not as good for working out,</v>

272
00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:30.810
<v Speaker 1>but the what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is is what's actually even better</v>

273
00:11:30.811 --> 00:11:33.900
<v Speaker 1>to me is that for the sound as those</v>
<v Speaker 1>beats threes,</v>

274
00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:37.380
<v Speaker 1>I got those wireless beats ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those things hook over your ear with</v>

275
00:11:37.381 --> 00:11:40.770
<v Speaker 1>that little rubber thing and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they lock in place that you could get a</v>

276
00:11:40.771 --> 00:11:43.380
<v Speaker 1>serious work on him with those on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>airpods there,</v>

277
00:11:43.410 --> 00:11:44.490
<v Speaker 1>they do fall off.</v>

278
00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:47.510
<v Speaker 1>They do fall off occasionally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have these skins too to make a</v>

279
00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:49.620
<v Speaker 1>little tighter on Amazon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

280
00:11:49.621 --> 00:11:53.110
<v Speaker 1>It's just like just like generic thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>that goes over it to kind of tighten it</v>

281
00:11:53.111 --> 00:11:55.060
<v Speaker 1>up in your ear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an awesome idea.</v>

282
00:11:55.061 --> 00:11:58.210
<v Speaker 1>It's not perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would be perfect if they hooked onto</v>

283
00:11:58.211 --> 00:12:01.180
<v Speaker 1>your ear but then they wouldn't be</v>
<v Speaker 1>fitting into that box.</v>

284
00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:04.180
<v Speaker 1>So it's almost like they can't be</v>
<v Speaker 1>perfect cause like part of the thing is</v>

285
00:12:04.181 --> 00:12:07.060
<v Speaker 1>that they fit in a little tiny ass box.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You pop it open,</v>

286
00:12:07.061 --> 00:12:09.940
<v Speaker 1>it's got a little green light on and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a battery pack too.</v>

287
00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:13.030
<v Speaker 1>And it's magnetic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean shit that slick.</v>

288
00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:15.460
<v Speaker 1>That's slick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one saw that coming either.</v>

289
00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:18.070
<v Speaker 1>That's one of those weird ones where</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody saw it coming.</v>

290
00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:21.370
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't really necessary,</v>

291
00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:23.920
<v Speaker 1>but no one saw it in the being necessary</v>
<v Speaker 1>until someone made it.</v>

292
00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:26.320
<v Speaker 1>I think I tell you what's not necessary</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that home pod,</v>

293
00:12:26.321 --> 00:12:29.710
<v Speaker 1>they release that thing is just a dump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They think stocks.</v>

294
00:12:29.711 --> 00:12:33.940
<v Speaker 1>I mean it sounds amazing but serious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So stupid compared to Alexa.</v>

295
00:12:33.941 --> 00:12:35.470
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it Alexis?</v>

296
00:12:35.471 --> 00:12:38.710
<v Speaker 1>Just smart as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so Amazon's Alexa,</v>

297
00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:39.760
<v Speaker 1>Siri.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's,</v>

298
00:12:39.761 --> 00:12:42.790
<v Speaker 1>what about the Google home?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you tried that one chart?</v>

299
00:12:42.791 --> 00:12:44.380
<v Speaker 1>That one's supposed to be better too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

300
00:12:44.381 --> 00:12:45.770
<v Speaker 1>I think it probably is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>

301
00:12:45.850 --> 00:12:47.650
<v Speaker 1>if it's the same as the android phone</v>
<v Speaker 1>line,</v>

302
00:12:47.651 --> 00:12:51.280
<v Speaker 1>it's good series.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that girl that was really hot but</v>

303
00:12:51.281 --> 00:12:54.430
<v Speaker 1>decided to stop working out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

304
00:12:54.431 --> 00:12:55.900
<v Speaker 1>And she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's still pretty hot,</v>

305
00:12:55.901 --> 00:12:58.450
<v Speaker 1>but then all these other girls are going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the gym all the time.</v>

306
00:12:58.770 --> 00:13:00.550
<v Speaker 1>You look at them and like good or bad</v>
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>

307
00:13:00.551 --> 00:13:04.720
<v Speaker 1>Look at her legs and series,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just kinda series kind of sloppy.</v>

308
00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:09.670
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty annoying now how many times</v>
<v Speaker 1>my Siri and my Alexis go off just from</v>

309
00:13:09.671 --> 00:13:10.660
<v Speaker 1>people going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey Siri,</v>

310
00:13:10.661 --> 00:13:12.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like on a podcast or something and it</v>

311
00:13:12.641 --> 00:13:14.140
<v Speaker 1>just ruins everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

312
00:13:14.410 --> 00:13:16.600
<v Speaker 1>If you have it set like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean when we've,</v>

313
00:13:16.690 --> 00:13:19.960
<v Speaker 1>we've probably triggered a thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a ton of people just you doing that</v>

314
00:13:19.961 --> 00:13:22.180
<v Speaker 1>right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People always complain when I say that.</v>

315
00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:24.880
<v Speaker 1>And then there's the,</v>

<v Speaker 1>song and she has one about technology.</v>

344
00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:29.110
<v Speaker 1>I always wonder what Stephen Hawking</v>
<v Speaker 1>never upgraded his voice.</v>

345
00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:30.220
<v Speaker 1>You didn't want to.</v>

347
00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:34.540
<v Speaker 1>keeping it that way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

348
00:14:34.690 --> 00:14:36.370
<v Speaker 1>I get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>

349
00:14:36.371 --> 00:14:37.990
<v Speaker 1>That's why he kept it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I mean,</v>

350
00:14:38.050 --> 00:14:40.060
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what kind of logic behind that is that</v>

351
00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:43.570
<v Speaker 1>maybe he just wanted to keep it creepy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you,</v>

352
00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:47.020
<v Speaker 1>he didn't want to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wanted to keep it obviously</v>

353
00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:50.350
<v Speaker 1>electronic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas there's some places you can get</v>

354
00:14:50.351 --> 00:14:52.190
<v Speaker 1>to with some these new</v>

355
00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:54.920
<v Speaker 2>voice things there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was that movie?</v>

356
00:14:54.921 --> 00:14:58.070
<v Speaker 2>She,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the movers are keen.</v>

357
00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:01.340
<v Speaker 2>Joaquin Phoenix.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was an interesting movie.</v>

358
00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:03.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They could have paid anybody to be his</v>

359
00:15:03.051 --> 00:15:05.430
<v Speaker 2>voice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would imagine that at the time the</v>

360
00:15:05.431 --> 00:15:07.600
<v Speaker 2>technology figured out he could have</v>
<v Speaker 2>been Samuel Jackson,</v>

361
00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:09.020
<v Speaker 2>but in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

362
00:15:09.021 --> 00:15:10.180
<v Speaker 2>for Stephen Hawking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

363
00:15:10.181 --> 00:15:12.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it probably would sound off like</v>

364
00:15:12.171 --> 00:15:14.720
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wouldn't sound like a real</v>

365
00:15:14.930 --> 00:15:16.840
<v Speaker 2>conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

366
00:15:16.850 --> 00:15:18.260
<v Speaker 2>It'd be all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

367
00:15:18.261 --> 00:15:20.660
<v Speaker 2>It was like you've heard them do that</v>
<v Speaker 2>with voice.</v>

368
00:15:20.690 --> 00:15:23.930
<v Speaker 2>Like when they take people's voices and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they chop them up and try to piece</v>

369
00:15:23.931 --> 00:15:26.630
<v Speaker 2>together some sort of audio of something</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they didn't really say.</v>

370
00:15:26.990 --> 00:15:29.540
<v Speaker 2>If they're being obvious about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know there's technology right</v>

371
00:15:29.541 --> 00:15:34.110
<v Speaker 2>now like photoshop that's going to allow</v>
<v Speaker 2>people to Stich audio together and I</v>

372
00:15:34.111 --> 00:15:36.020
<v Speaker 2>believe we've talked about it on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>podcast before.</v>

373
00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:37.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's getting better and better.</v>

374
00:15:38.090 --> 00:15:42.170
<v Speaker 2>There's a radio lab episode where they</v>
<v Speaker 2>showed where it's at now and it's one of</v>

375
00:15:42.171 --> 00:15:44.990
<v Speaker 2>those things where it's right now it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>not ready.</v>

376
00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:48.200
<v Speaker 2>It's still like if you heard it you go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh that's not Brian.</v>

377
00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:51.950
<v Speaker 2>That's a fake conversation put together</v>
<v Speaker 2>from a bunch of shit.</v>

378
00:15:51.951 --> 00:15:56.060
<v Speaker 2>Brian said it's like that porn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that fake porn that was,</v>

379
00:15:56.061 --> 00:16:00.770
<v Speaker 2>that's even more crazy cause they could</v>
<v Speaker 2>just take your face like take pictures</v>

380
00:16:00.771 --> 00:16:05.390
<v Speaker 2>and pretty seamlessly stitch your face</v>
<v Speaker 2>onto the character with emotions,</v>

381
00:16:05.391 --> 00:16:07.370
<v Speaker 2>with opening mouth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>long linking and stuff.</v>

382
00:16:07.371 --> 00:16:10.700
<v Speaker 2>I've seen some really good ones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the girl from Harry Potter.</v>

383
00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:13.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well it's what they're doing with</v>

384
00:16:13.041 --> 00:16:14.000
<v Speaker 2>snapchat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

385
00:16:14.001 --> 00:16:16.700
<v Speaker 2>When someone pretends to be a rick from</v>
<v Speaker 2>the walking dead,</v>

386
00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:19.820
<v Speaker 2>like Deleah did that and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God damn,</v>

387
00:16:19.821 --> 00:16:22.610
<v Speaker 2>that's pretty close.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty close.</v>

388
00:16:22.910 --> 00:16:27.050
<v Speaker 2>Like I know that it's obviously that</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a thing going on here but it's</v>

389
00:16:27.051 --> 00:16:29.720
<v Speaker 2>pretty close to what it would really</v>
<v Speaker 2>look like.</v>

390
00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:33.680
<v Speaker 2>Fucks get enough good enough to make you</v>
<v Speaker 2>a whoa.</v>

391
00:16:34.010 --> 00:16:37.630
<v Speaker 2>This wasn't around before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if someone showed you that snapchat</v>

392
00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:41.510
<v Speaker 2>thing that all the girls do where they</v>
<v Speaker 2>put dog faces on and shit and Barf Barf</v>

393
00:16:41.511 --> 00:16:43.640
<v Speaker 2>and pretend to be a puppy dog or</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unicorns or whatever.</v>

394
00:16:43.850 --> 00:16:48.850
<v Speaker 2>Someone showed you that just 10 years</v>
<v Speaker 2>ago you would be holy Shit.</v>

395
00:16:49.310 --> 00:16:51.680
<v Speaker 2>You wouldn't believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You wouldn't believe it.</v>

396
00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:55.190
<v Speaker 2>You would look at like that thing that</v>
<v Speaker 2>lets you become rick from the walking</v>

397
00:16:55.191 --> 00:16:57.320
<v Speaker 2>dead and you'd go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck man,</v>

398
00:16:57.470 --> 00:17:01.760
<v Speaker 2>this is incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If someone showed you that 1998 well how</v>

399
00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:04.970
<v Speaker 2>mind blowing and groundbreaking that</v>
<v Speaker 2>would be.</v>

400
00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:10.180
<v Speaker 2>Now it's a part of an APP that's on your</v>
<v Speaker 2>phone that sits in your pocket like what</v>

401
00:17:11.031 --> 00:17:14.960
<v Speaker 2>happened and how quick did this happen</v>
<v Speaker 2>and which holds it going in.</v>

402
00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:18.740
<v Speaker 2>It's probably going to be a suppository</v>
<v Speaker 2>just so that the ale,</v>

403
00:17:18.741 --> 00:17:21.700
<v Speaker 2>it's like a ironic like that.</v>

404
00:17:21.710 --> 00:17:26.120
<v Speaker 2>The aliens have figured out a way to</v>
<v Speaker 2>mock us while defeating us and the way</v>

405
00:17:26.121 --> 00:17:30.170
<v Speaker 2>is just to give you the most ultimate</v>
<v Speaker 2>bliss with his tiny little robot deck,</v>

406
00:17:30.171 --> 00:17:32.510
<v Speaker 2>you don't even feel it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just put this robot dick and your</v>

407
00:17:32.511 --> 00:17:36.500
<v Speaker 2>butt's depository and because your</v>
<v Speaker 2>button does nav like skin,</v>

408
00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:38.930
<v Speaker 2>it's not the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like open tissue.</v>

409
00:17:39.410 --> 00:17:41.420
<v Speaker 2>That's why it's so good for getting</v>
<v Speaker 2>infected.</v>

410
00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:46.870
<v Speaker 2>So this little robot can just seamlessly</v>
<v Speaker 2>interact with all that open tissue and</v>

411
00:17:48.501 --> 00:17:53.501
<v Speaker 2>that's how you with God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to talk us in just with</v>

412
00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:56.010
<v Speaker 2>the way they did with these Cambridge</v>
<v Speaker 2>analytics.</v>

413
00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:59.520
<v Speaker 2>They sneak you in the door.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You think it's a personality quiz really</v>

414
00:17:59.521 --> 00:18:01.350
<v Speaker 2>electing a dumb president,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

415
00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:02.400
<v Speaker 2>same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You think,</v>

416
00:18:02.401 --> 00:18:04.410
<v Speaker 2>well I'm just going to go meet God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

417
00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:08.160
<v Speaker 2>you giving birth to the robot empire</v>
<v Speaker 2>through little tiny robot dicks.</v>

418
00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:11.580
<v Speaker 2>It's not impossible to think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

419
00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:14.670
<v Speaker 2>we're willing to put glasses over our</v>
<v Speaker 2>face so we could see better.</v>

420
00:18:15.090 --> 00:18:18.540
<v Speaker 2>Why wouldn't we put little little metal</v>
<v Speaker 2>bullets up our,</v>

421
00:18:18.541 --> 00:18:22.440
<v Speaker 2>but if you found out that it makes life</v>
<v Speaker 2>infinitely better,</v>

422
00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:24.390
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can't believe that this is the case.</v>

423
00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:28.230
<v Speaker 2>The only way to do it is up your bud.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know we've,</v>

424
00:18:28.231 --> 00:18:30.360
<v Speaker 2>we've tried and then people like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh come on,</v>

425
00:18:30.361 --> 00:18:32.340
<v Speaker 2>I'm not doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then a few guys do it and they're</v>

426
00:18:32.341 --> 00:18:33.930
<v Speaker 2>walking around your neighborhood and</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck it.</v>

427
00:18:33.931 --> 00:18:36.960
<v Speaker 2>Sparkles are coming out of their eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're so happy.</v>

428
00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:40.080
<v Speaker 2>They're so happy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They couldn't be happier.</v>

429
00:18:40.290 --> 00:18:41.270
<v Speaker 2>And you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God damn it,</v>

430
00:18:41.271 --> 00:18:43.620
<v Speaker 2>I need to try it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are flying.</v>

431
00:18:43.650 --> 00:18:46.300
<v Speaker 2>They're flying around your neighborhood</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they have that robot deck.</v>

432
00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:49.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like Andy Stumpf from the s in a</v>

433
00:18:49.170 --> 00:18:50.790
<v Speaker 2>wingsuit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're doing that around your</v>

434
00:18:50.791 --> 00:18:53.310
<v Speaker 2>neighborhood but they control it</v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves and it's all because of this</v>

435
00:18:53.311 --> 00:18:55.680
<v Speaker 2>robot Dick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that Ben Space and time just have to do</v>

436
00:18:55.681 --> 00:18:56.070
<v Speaker 2>at once.</v>

437
00:18:56.070 --> 00:18:59.130
<v Speaker 2>Or is it a every day keeping your house</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you take it out of your ass,</v>

438
00:18:59.131 --> 00:19:03.670
<v Speaker 2>then you become a normal human and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>eventually they figured out a way to</v>

439
00:19:03.671 --> 00:19:05.610
<v Speaker 2>keep it in there to keep it in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

440
00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:10.700
<v Speaker 2>they like bolt it to the wall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your asshole strap we should but strap,</v>

441
00:19:10.770 --> 00:19:12.090
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got to get it cleaned out every</v>

442
00:19:12.091 --> 00:19:13.740
<v Speaker 2>now and then cause shit gets caked on</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

443
00:19:13.741 --> 00:19:15.520
<v Speaker 2>On the way out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't,</v>

444
00:19:16.230 --> 00:19:19.560
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't always get the full signal to</v>
<v Speaker 2>your skin,</v>

445
00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:21.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you have to have somebody do it?</v>

446
00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:23.620
<v Speaker 2>I could do it in myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not opposed to,</v>

447
00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:26.820
<v Speaker 2>I need to go some doctor sticker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>robot Dick in my butt.</v>

448
00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:30.790
<v Speaker 2>Come on</v>
<v Speaker 2>suck.</v>

449
00:19:30.810 --> 00:19:34.290
<v Speaker 2>If you were like bungee jumping and your</v>
<v Speaker 2>robot dick fell out and all of a sudden,</v>

450
00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:37.290
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sadness in the middle of the day,</v>

451
00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:38.460
<v Speaker 2>that would be crazy.</v>

452
00:19:38.610 --> 00:19:39.930
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're already doing that with pills,</v>

453
00:19:39.931 --> 00:19:42.660
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>People that are addicted to Xanax and I</v>

454
00:19:42.661 --> 00:19:45.810
<v Speaker 2>know a few.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That shit apparently makes you feel</v>

455
00:19:45.811 --> 00:19:47.910
<v Speaker 2>great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that the upper or downer?</v>

456
00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:48.800
<v Speaker 2>That's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

457
00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:50.820
<v Speaker 2>there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no problems in the world drug.</v>

458
00:19:51.270 --> 00:19:55.140
<v Speaker 2>That's an anxiety reliever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the people that take it,</v>

459
00:19:55.141 --> 00:19:57.300
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they get hooked on that shit.</v>

460
00:19:57.330 --> 00:20:00.250
<v Speaker 2>Dom irrera is very open about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He takes a shit every day.</v>

461
00:20:01.770 --> 00:20:03.090
<v Speaker 2>He's so great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's great.</v>

462
00:20:03.091 --> 00:20:05.280
<v Speaker 2>He had him last night on killed Tony.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's the best of that.</v>

463
00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:07.720
<v Speaker 2>No one's better at killed Tony.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The dumber.</v>

464
00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:10.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's so quick,</v>

465
00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:12.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he knows like the most ridiculous</v>

466
00:20:12.571 --> 00:20:15.030
<v Speaker 2>shit to say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

467
00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:16.890
<v Speaker 2>But he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he likes them.</v>

468
00:20:16.891 --> 00:20:19.440
<v Speaker 2>Xanax.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know a lot of Stan hope like xanax</v>

469
00:20:19.441 --> 00:20:21.510
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just joking around about if he</v>

470
00:20:21.511 --> 00:20:25.080
<v Speaker 2>got out of a plane and a kiss the floor</v>
<v Speaker 2>when he,</v>

471
00:20:25.110 --> 00:20:27.930
<v Speaker 2>when he landed in America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'd be because he saw xanax on the</v>

472
00:20:27.931 --> 00:20:28.764
<v Speaker 2>ground.</v>

473
00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:34.440
<v Speaker 2>They love those things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm scared of that shit.</v>

474
00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:36.210
<v Speaker 2>I don't want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want anything that makes me feel</v>

475
00:20:36.211 --> 00:20:39.030
<v Speaker 2>like there's no problems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the only reason why a lot of</v>

476
00:20:39.031 --> 00:20:42.150
<v Speaker 2>people don't do it is because they don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a friend that has a bunch of Xanax</v>

477
00:20:42.151 --> 00:20:44.130
<v Speaker 2>that's constantly giving them Xanax or</v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

478
00:20:44.131 --> 00:20:46.180
<v Speaker 2>Cause I'd never see pills or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

479
00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:48.230
<v Speaker 2>I'm not around that road at all at like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

480
00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:49.900
<v Speaker 2>I don't even want a xanax.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Looks like,</v>

481
00:20:49.901 --> 00:20:50.920
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

482
00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:53.500
<v Speaker 2>But I bet if we had a friend that always</v>
<v Speaker 2>had xanax on,</v>

483
00:20:53.501 --> 00:20:55.090
<v Speaker 2>I'm always [inaudible] Xanax,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

484
00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:58.960
<v Speaker 2>I bet that's how you get into it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think somebody just tells you,</v>

485
00:20:58.961 --> 00:21:01.290
<v Speaker 2>you need to relax.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

486
00:21:01.310 --> 00:21:02.240
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just,</v>

487
00:21:02.330 --> 00:21:04.930
<v Speaker 2>there's so much anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

488
00:21:05.230 --> 00:21:09.820
<v Speaker 2>the world is filled with possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The world is filled with danger.</v>

489
00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:12.010
<v Speaker 2>The world's filled with good things and</v>
<v Speaker 2>bad things.</v>

490
00:21:12.010 --> 00:21:13.960
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of shit going on.</v>

491
00:21:14.170 --> 00:21:17.890
<v Speaker 2>If you don't have some anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it must be because you're just choosing</v>

492
00:21:17.891 --> 00:21:20.830
<v Speaker 2>to not pay attention.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like anybody who lives in New York City,</v>

493
00:21:21.250 --> 00:21:24.910
<v Speaker 2>you live in New York City.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I imagine all the shit that's going on</v>

494
00:21:24.911 --> 00:21:27.520
<v Speaker 2>around you all the time while you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>just sitting there.</v>

495
00:21:27.670 --> 00:21:30.970
<v Speaker 2>You're supposed to be aware of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just supposed to hope everybody keeps</v>

496
00:21:30.971 --> 00:21:33.130
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's supposed to have everybody's cool.</v>

497
00:21:33.250 --> 00:21:34.420
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're in your apartment.</v>

498
00:21:34.421 --> 00:21:37.290
<v Speaker 2>You're on the 13th floor of a 60 floor</v>
<v Speaker 2>building.</v>

499
00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:40.720
<v Speaker 2>It's filled with people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's another one right next to it.</v>

500
00:21:40.721 --> 00:21:43.060
<v Speaker 2>There's another one right next to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They go all the way down the street.</v>

501
00:21:43.061 --> 00:21:45.910
<v Speaker 2>They're filled with people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are fucking everywhere and you're</v>

502
00:21:45.911 --> 00:21:49.330
<v Speaker 2>supposed to just be chilled out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't make no sense to me,</v>

503
00:21:49.331 --> 00:21:50.560
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

504
00:21:50.561 --> 00:21:52.270
<v Speaker 2>I'm with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're nervous,</v>

505
00:21:53.170 --> 00:21:54.070
<v Speaker 2>you're anxious.</v>

506
00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:58.270
<v Speaker 2>You're driving and traffic every day and</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are on their phones and then not</v>

507
00:21:58.271 --> 00:22:00.610
<v Speaker 2>paying attention and everything you eat</v>
<v Speaker 2>gives you cancer.</v>

508
00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:02.620
<v Speaker 2>You're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not anxious.</v>

509
00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:04.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand you.</v>

510
00:22:04.420 --> 00:22:05.920
<v Speaker 2>You should be anxious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

511
00:22:05.921 --> 00:22:08.620
<v Speaker 2>this is the argument for not living the</v>
<v Speaker 2>way we live.</v>

512
00:22:08.621 --> 00:22:12.100
<v Speaker 2>It's not the argument for taking a pill</v>
<v Speaker 2>that kills that part of your brain that</v>

513
00:22:12.101 --> 00:22:16.720
<v Speaker 2>makes you anxious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you ought to audibly cy a lot?</v>

514
00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:19.150
<v Speaker 2>Mostly for humor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

515
00:22:19.210 --> 00:22:24.210
<v Speaker 2>I don't audibly sigh like by myself like</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh but I'll do it like that.</v>

516
00:22:24.581 --> 00:22:25.730
<v Speaker 2>Like for a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh</v>

517
00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:29.970
<v Speaker 2>I catch myself more audible audibly</v>
<v Speaker 2>signing more and more.</v>

518
00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:32.320
<v Speaker 2>The order I get like just like little</v>
<v Speaker 2>things where I'll just like look at</v>

519
00:22:32.321 --> 00:22:34.630
<v Speaker 2>something like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh that kind of shit.</v>

520
00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:39.010
<v Speaker 2>But I didn't used to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm going to go to oil.</v>

521
00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:43.600
<v Speaker 2>Oil is a good one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's like the things I grew up with.</v>

522
00:22:43.630 --> 00:22:45.640
<v Speaker 2>Oil event.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it cultural appropriation?</v>

523
00:22:45.820 --> 00:22:48.640
<v Speaker 2>I have to ask my Jewish friends from La</v>
<v Speaker 2>to start saying Oi Bay.</v>

524
00:22:48.790 --> 00:22:51.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause like nobody ever got mad at</v>

525

<v Speaker 2>model model and this girl,</v>

526

527
00:23:03.250 --> 00:23:05.840
<v Speaker 2>It's not used that often that it is in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jersey.</v>

528
00:23:06.670 --> 00:23:06.990
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

529
00:23:06.990 --> 00:23:10.470
<v Speaker 2>Go to the east coast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go to where those old school guineas</v>

530
00:23:10.770 --> 00:23:15.450
<v Speaker 2>landed on boats and fucked each other on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the rocks and made a bunch of them and</v>

531
00:23:15.451 --> 00:23:18.720
<v Speaker 2>they all stayed there about fungal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know it's happening and had one of</v>
<v Speaker 2>those</v>

534
00:23:25.290 --> 00:23:29.580
<v Speaker 2>shows you're a moron.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

535
00:23:29.581 --> 00:23:31.950

<v Speaker 2>We all have them in high school though.</v>

536
00:23:32.690 --> 00:23:35.340
<v Speaker 2>It was like if you had a gold chain with</v>
<v Speaker 2>a horn,</v>

<v Speaker 2>and virility.</v>

544

00:25:34.670 --> 00:25:37.970
<v Speaker 2>those Italian horns,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're all rounded at the top.</v>

576
00:25:37.971 --> 00:25:39.680
<v Speaker 2>Like Tj's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is insane.</v>

577
00:25:41.180 --> 00:25:42.530
<v Speaker 2>I don't see any of them that look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

578
00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:45.500
<v Speaker 2>that's not an Italian horn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the wrong,</v>

579
00:25:46.210 --> 00:25:49.490
<v Speaker 2>that's some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's some like Gucci Shit.</v>

580
00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:52.160
<v Speaker 2>Like someone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some designer got ahold of it and the</v>

581
00:25:52.161 --> 00:25:55.700
<v Speaker 2>new take on the Italian horn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all the rage everyone wears.</v>

582
00:25:56.390 --> 00:25:58.460
<v Speaker 2>Everyone was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

583
00:25:58.500 --> 00:25:59.570
<v Speaker 2>I've got three on.</v>

584
00:26:03.740 --> 00:26:06.260
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe people wear that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They do.</v>

585
00:26:06.470 --> 00:26:09.020
<v Speaker 2>They can't help themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They grow up in those communities.</v>

586
00:26:09.021 --> 00:26:10.550
<v Speaker 2>I did it too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wore one.</v>

587
00:26:10.790 --> 00:26:12.030
<v Speaker 2>You're around a bunch of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

588
00:26:12.050 --> 00:26:14.360
<v Speaker 2>east coast Italian people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're all wearing it.</v>

589
00:26:14.361 --> 00:26:16.220
<v Speaker 2>You're all wearing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

590
00:26:16.221 --> 00:26:18.050
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got yet Italian horn.</v>

591
00:26:20.210 --> 00:26:22.520
<v Speaker 2>And when I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I saw the guy that had it on,</v>

592
00:26:22.521 --> 00:26:23.180
<v Speaker 2>he took,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got,</v>

593
00:26:23.180 --> 00:26:24.520
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got in and kissed it.</v>

594
00:26:24.521 --> 00:26:28.910
<v Speaker 2>So he kissed the ges.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just my good luck,</v>

595
00:26:28.911 --> 00:26:31.760
<v Speaker 2>judge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God bless you.</v>

<v Speaker 2>God bless you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What saint be Saint Peter,</v>

597
00:26:35.571 --> 00:26:36.990
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

598
00:26:37.850 --> 00:26:38.451
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

599
00:26:38.451 --> 00:26:40.550
<v Speaker 2>it's gotta be which one's attached to</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

600
00:26:40.700 --> 00:26:42.580
<v Speaker 2>That's like weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there's always affiliations,</v>

601
00:26:42.590 --> 00:26:43.980
<v Speaker 2>like certain saints are</v>

602
00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:45.930
<v Speaker 5>attached to certain,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

603
00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:51.360
<v Speaker 5>fucking ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's all those ancient immigrant</v>

604
00:26:51.361 --> 00:26:54.270
<v Speaker 5>cultures,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but is it any different really than like</v>

605
00:26:54.271 --> 00:26:59.271
<v Speaker 5>looking back at like aol in 1996</v>
<v Speaker 5>trafficking porn people are just way</v>

606
00:27:01.081 --> 00:27:03.570
<v Speaker 5>different now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're just way different.</v>

607
00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:07.800
<v Speaker 5>Like human beings are way more aware of</v>
<v Speaker 5>shit today.</v>

608
00:27:07.950 --> 00:27:12.950
<v Speaker 5>Even if they're misinformed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're at least more aware of a lot of</v>

609
00:27:13.321 --> 00:27:17.670
<v Speaker 5>things in 1990 then,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then they were in 1994 [inaudible] 96</v>

610
00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:22.650
<v Speaker 5>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would say it's like a several fold</v>

611
00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:27.240
<v Speaker 5>increase and how much we're aware of and</v>
<v Speaker 5>what we actually look out in the world.</v>

612
00:27:27.270 --> 00:27:29.340
<v Speaker 5>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a completely different thing now,</v>

613
00:27:29.910 --> 00:27:31.230
<v Speaker 5>don't you think?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah,</v>

614
00:27:32.300 --> 00:27:36.090
<v Speaker 5>I see.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What are we doing today that they're</v>

615
00:27:36.091 --> 00:27:39.750
<v Speaker 5>going to look back on and go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>those fucking morons.</v>

616
00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:42.390
<v Speaker 5>How did they do that besides</v>
<v Speaker 5>circumcision?</v>

617
00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:46.170
<v Speaker 5>Circumcision is a big one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The one day they can stop cutting baby</v>

618
00:27:46.171 --> 00:27:47.580
<v Speaker 5>decks and they're going to look back and</v>
<v Speaker 5>go,</v>

619
00:27:47.581 --> 00:27:50.670
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is crazy,</v>

620
00:27:50.870 --> 00:27:51.600
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You hope not.</v>

621
00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:54.270
<v Speaker 5>You're taking a baby day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't want to stand out.</v>

622
00:27:59.140 --> 00:28:01.050
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't like the uncut ones,</v>

623
00:28:01.051 --> 00:28:01.861
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It freaked me out.</v>

624
00:28:01.861 --> 00:28:03.570
<v Speaker 5>I think we've talked about this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the way they look,</v>

625
00:28:03.780 --> 00:28:04.620
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

626
00:28:04.621 --> 00:28:07.410
<v Speaker 5>Just the luck cause I don't really don't</v>
<v Speaker 5>think that affects you.</v>

627
00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:09.430
<v Speaker 5>I've asked you out there sucking dicks</v>
<v Speaker 5>on the sneak.</v>

628
00:28:09.431 --> 00:28:12.230
<v Speaker 5>KIPP asked and I've heard they smell</v>
<v Speaker 5>more than a regular dick.</v>

629
00:28:12.300 --> 00:28:14.490
<v Speaker 5>Why don't I think you should wash your</v>
<v Speaker 5>deck basically.</v>

630
00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:18.030
<v Speaker 5>Overall though,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the advice I'd give anybody's Dick.</v>

631
00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:18.751
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

632
00:28:18.751 --> 00:28:21.370
<v Speaker 5>but that's still crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I bet if you trim pussy loves to be</v>

633
00:28:21.371 --> 00:28:23.580
<v Speaker 5>easier to take care of that thing too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's still crazy.</v>

634
00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:25.890
<v Speaker 5>Told you that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just nuts.</v>

635
00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:26.280
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

636
00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:29.340
<v Speaker 5>it's a nutty thing that we've just</v>
<v Speaker 5>gotten really accustomed to doing.</v>

637
00:28:30.030 --> 00:28:32.340
<v Speaker 5>Cutting skin off your deck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like why?</v>

638
00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:34.950
<v Speaker 5>What and the fact that the majority do</v>
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

639
00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:40.040
<v Speaker 5>What they're going to look back in 2018</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're going to look back at this time</v>

640
00:28:40.981 --> 00:28:44.670
<v Speaker 5>period and they're going to go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how was that possible that they had the</v>

641
00:28:44.671 --> 00:28:47.820
<v Speaker 5>internet,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they had all this knowledge,</v>

642
00:28:47.821 --> 00:28:50.220
<v Speaker 5>all they had,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all these scientific studies that had</v>

643
00:28:50.221 --> 00:28:50.760
<v Speaker 5>been done.</v>

644
00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:52.590
<v Speaker 5>They knew about psychology and</v>
<v Speaker 5>ideologies.</v>

645
00:28:52.591 --> 00:28:54.640
<v Speaker 5>They knew about the health.</v>

663
00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:47.710

<v Speaker 5>How do you know whether or not someone's</v>

664
00:29:47.711 --> 00:29:52.000
<v Speaker 5>legit?</v>
<v Speaker 5>How do you decide that no one should be</v>

665
00:29:52.090 --> 00:29:55.090
<v Speaker 5>tax exempt,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially someone who's taking in Shit</v>

666
00:29:55.091 --> 00:29:59.080
<v Speaker 5>fucking ton piles of money.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you're some sort of church or</v>

667
00:29:59.081 --> 00:30:02.860
<v Speaker 5>whatever and you're getting donations in</v>
<v Speaker 5>the millions and millions of dollars and</v>

668
00:30:02.861 --> 00:30:05.200
<v Speaker 5>you're like one of them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Benny Hinn assholes out there driving a</v>

669
00:30:05.201 --> 00:30:08.800
<v Speaker 5>Bentley.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Amazon ANC paid zero federal taxes in</v>

670
00:30:08.801 --> 00:30:13.480
<v Speaker 5>2017 gets 789 million windfall from new</v>
<v Speaker 5>tax law.</v>

671
00:30:13.540 --> 00:30:16.270
<v Speaker 5>They paid zero cause I work.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

672
00:30:16.450 --> 00:30:18.970
<v Speaker 5>that Kinda Shit shouldn't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That shouldn't happen either.</v>

673
00:30:19.210 --> 00:30:22.870
<v Speaker 5>But the idea is that a corporation,</v>
<v Speaker 5>now,</v>

674
00:30:22.871 --> 00:30:25.600
<v Speaker 5>this is not my idea,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so don't think I'm supporting this.</v>

675
00:30:26.020 --> 00:30:28.750
<v Speaker 5>I have to preface this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the idea is that corporations</v>

676
00:30:28.751 --> 00:30:33.730
<v Speaker 5>shouldn't pay tax because all of the</v>
<v Speaker 5>individuals who are making money in that</v>

677
00:30:33.731 --> 00:30:38.110
<v Speaker 5>corporation already pay taxes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is the argument that I've heard and</v>

678
00:30:38.111 --> 00:30:39.220
<v Speaker 5>that made me go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

679
00:30:39.221 --> 00:30:42.010
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the argument was why might've been</v>

680
00:30:42.011 --> 00:30:43.990
<v Speaker 5>Peter Schiff?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did he say that to me?</v>

681
00:30:45.250 --> 00:30:47.980
<v Speaker 5>I don't think it was on the air.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Might not have been him.</v>

682
00:30:48.130 --> 00:30:49.570
<v Speaker 5>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Anyway,</v>

683
00:30:50.110 --> 00:30:53.890
<v Speaker 5>sidetrack.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The idea is that a corporation is not an</v>

684
00:30:53.891 --> 00:30:56.410
<v Speaker 5>individual,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so why should it pay taxes?</v>

685
00:30:56.440 --> 00:30:59.740
<v Speaker 5>It's not a person.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a conglomeration of people.</v>

686
00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:03.550
<v Speaker 5>Those people already pay taxes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The corporation has money that it's,</v>

687
00:31:04.230 --> 00:31:07.870
<v Speaker 5>that's piled up right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then like it's got a value and it's</v>

688
00:31:07.871 --> 00:31:10.870
<v Speaker 5>got,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's on the stock market and it goes up</v>

689
00:31:10.871 --> 00:31:13.810
<v Speaker 5>and it goes down and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and they're always kind of looking to</v>

690
00:31:13.811 --> 00:31:18.811
<v Speaker 5>improve their bottom line and universal</v>
<v Speaker 5>constant growth.</v>

691
00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:20.740
<v Speaker 5>But it's not a person.</v>

692
00:31:23.650 --> 00:31:28.510
<v Speaker 5>I feel like corporations have gotten</v>
<v Speaker 5>rights like people over the last 20 plus</v>

693
00:31:28.511 --> 00:31:29.344
<v Speaker 5>years.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're right,</v>

694
00:31:29.350 --> 00:31:31.390
<v Speaker 5>they have,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they gotten rights in terms of how much</v>

695
00:31:31.391 --> 00:31:34.480
<v Speaker 5>they could donate to charities to uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>excuse me,</v>

696
00:31:34.481 --> 00:31:38.500
<v Speaker 5>political campaigns.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that used to be not the case.</v>

697
00:31:38.501 --> 00:31:42.340
<v Speaker 5>They used to have a limit and now they</v>
<v Speaker 5>are like an individual in which they can</v>

698
00:31:42.341 --> 00:31:45.250
<v Speaker 5>donate as much money as they want to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Political campaigns and doesn't a</v>

699
00:31:45.251 --> 00:31:48.070
<v Speaker 5>corporation also act to defend itself?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sort of like,</v>

700
00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:50.500
<v Speaker 5>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Can you google that,</v>

701
00:31:50.501 --> 00:31:53.110
<v Speaker 5>make sure that's true that corporations,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

702
00:31:54.160 --> 00:31:56.800
<v Speaker 5>they can donate as much as they want to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Political campaigns.</v>

703
00:31:56.801 --> 00:31:59.260
<v Speaker 5>Now I think there's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want to say this is like</v>

704
00:32:01.630 --> 00:32:05.350
<v Speaker 5>during the Obama administration.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fucking Obama.</v>

705
00:32:05.410 --> 00:32:06.910
<v Speaker 5>Obama,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

706
00:32:06.940 --> 00:32:08.980
<v Speaker 5>I think this was during the Obama</v>
<v Speaker 5>administration.</v>

707
00:32:09.190 --> 00:32:12.250
<v Speaker 5>It's a disturbing one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a disturbing one to me because</v>

708
00:32:12.251 --> 00:32:13.780
<v Speaker 5>that is a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that a sale.</v>

709
00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:16.780
<v Speaker 5>That's a lot of influence where someone</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a Amazon,</v>

710
00:32:16.990 --> 00:32:20.080
<v Speaker 5>I don't think Amazon's evil.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What's the limit wanted to be?</v>

711
00:32:20.140 --> 00:32:22.000
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean if the limits like hi,</v>

712
00:32:22.590 --> 00:32:24.250
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maxine either thousand dollars,</v>

713
00:32:24.310 --> 00:32:26.980
<v Speaker 5>there's no limit limit to should be a</v>
<v Speaker 5>limit.</v>

714
00:32:27.550 --> 00:32:30.040
<v Speaker 5>But I don't think there is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There has to be,</v>

715
00:32:30.250 --> 00:32:31.000
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

716
00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:33.760
<v Speaker 5>How sad is it that I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I should know.</v>

717
00:32:35.170 --> 00:32:36.730
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>See what we got here.</v>

718
00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:40.090
<v Speaker 5>I've seen various things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The one I'm right now is that an s</v>

719
00:32:40.090 --> 00:32:44.900
<v Speaker 6>corp can uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>deduct up to 50% of its adjusted gross</v>

720
00:32:44.901 --> 00:32:46.940
<v Speaker 6>income to be,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

721
00:32:46.990 --> 00:32:48.940
<v Speaker 6>as a qualified yes.</v>

722
00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:50.980
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How much money can,</v>

723
00:32:51.010 --> 00:32:52.740
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there was a law passed and I'm looking</v>

724
00:32:52.741 --> 00:32:54.740
<v Speaker 5>at,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not popping up how much money</v>

725
00:32:56.900 --> 00:33:01.370
<v Speaker 5>there was a law passed that stated how</v>
<v Speaker 5>much money a corporation can donate to</v>

726
00:33:01.371 --> 00:33:04.610
<v Speaker 5>political campaigns.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was very specific that a</v>

727
00:33:04.611 --> 00:33:09.380
<v Speaker 5>corporation is seen as an individual.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When you look up that corporations seen</v>

728
00:33:09.381 --> 00:33:12.110
<v Speaker 5>as individual for donation,</v>
<v Speaker 5>political campaigns,</v>

729
00:33:13.460 --> 00:33:16.020
<v Speaker 5>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not in anybody's good at,</v>

730
00:33:16.170 --> 00:33:21.170
<v Speaker 5>in anybody's interest that these huge</v>
<v Speaker 5>companies like Amazon or anything that</v>

731
00:33:21.831 --> 00:33:25.670
<v Speaker 5>size that is fucking billions of dollars</v>
<v Speaker 5>that they should just be able to get</v>

732
00:33:25.671 --> 00:33:30.500
<v Speaker 5>together and influence a politician with</v>
<v Speaker 5>a shit ton of money and then the</v>

733
00:33:30.501 --> 00:33:33.820
<v Speaker 5>politician does their bidding and helps</v>
<v Speaker 5>them be bigger and stronger and it may</v>

734
00:33:33.821 --> 00:33:36.140
<v Speaker 5>be fucks over.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Some people gotta be really careful</v>

735
00:33:36.141 --> 00:33:39.710
<v Speaker 5>about that because the politicians could</v>
<v Speaker 5>find a way of arguing it.</v>

736
00:33:39.711 --> 00:33:40.521
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I could see,</v>

737
00:33:40.521 --> 00:33:45.050
<v Speaker 5>but what is that how he would vote</v>
<v Speaker 5>without that influence?</v>

738
00:33:45.110 --> 00:33:47.360
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So all these politicians and get into</v>

739
00:33:47.361 --> 00:33:49.970
<v Speaker 5>those positions are all just influence</v>
<v Speaker 5>peddlers.</v>

740
00:33:50.090 --> 00:33:51.950
<v Speaker 5>They're just peddling influence.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The saying,</v>

741
00:33:51.951 --> 00:33:52.611
<v Speaker 5>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

742
00:33:52.611 --> 00:33:54.680
<v Speaker 5>if you help me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll help you scratch my back.</v>

743
00:33:54.681 --> 00:33:57.110
<v Speaker 5>I'll scratch yours.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then not looking out for the people that</v>

744
00:33:57.111 --> 00:33:59.720
<v Speaker 5>voted them in at all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're looking out for the people that</v>

745
00:33:59.780 --> 00:34:04.190
<v Speaker 5>paid all the money to make them more</v>
<v Speaker 5>prominent so that people would vote them</v>

746
00:34:04.191 --> 00:34:05.990
<v Speaker 5>in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's very sneaky,</v>

747
00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:08.480
<v Speaker 5>like it should have been fixed a long</v>
<v Speaker 5>time ago.</v>

748
00:34:08.570 --> 00:34:10.370
<v Speaker 5>It's really,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you think of all the shit like</v>

749
00:34:10.371 --> 00:34:12.410
<v Speaker 5>insider trading,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that is illegal.</v>

750
00:34:12.590 --> 00:34:13.423
<v Speaker 5>Like if,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

751
00:34:13.670 --> 00:34:17.240
<v Speaker 5>if Jamie really did know something about</v>
<v Speaker 5>facebook and then,</v>

752
00:34:17.241 --> 00:34:18.830
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he told us and like,</v>

753
00:34:18.831 --> 00:34:20.300
<v Speaker 5>hey dude,</v>
<v Speaker 5>shit's going down.</v>

754
00:34:20.330 --> 00:34:24.050
<v Speaker 5>Get rid of all your facebook stock right</v>
<v Speaker 5>now and you and I went crazy and got rid</v>

755
00:34:24.051 --> 00:34:26.060
<v Speaker 5>of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We could get in trouble.</v>

756
00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:30.840
<v Speaker 6>Like Paul Ryan's in trouble for it now.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Something thing he goes supposedly was</v>

757
00:34:31.110 --> 00:34:32.910
<v Speaker 6>he sold a bunch of stock.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

758
00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:34.880
<v Speaker 5>so someone told him and he bailed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

759
00:34:35.370 --> 00:34:38.400
<v Speaker 5>See that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How is that illegal?</v>

760
00:34:38.610 --> 00:34:43.610
<v Speaker 5>But it's not illegal to influence</v>
<v Speaker 5>politicians and have corporations spend</v>

761
00:34:44.911 --> 00:34:47.400
<v Speaker 5>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>tons of money and then obviously get</v>

762
00:34:47.401 --> 00:34:50.550
<v Speaker 5>preferential treatment and obviously get</v>
<v Speaker 5>laws pushed.</v>

763
00:34:51.150 --> 00:34:53.910
<v Speaker 5>Here it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Paul Ryan's sold shares on same day as</v>

764
00:34:53.911 --> 00:34:58.911
<v Speaker 5>private briefing of banking crisis webs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That seems like a dumb move,</v>

765
00:35:00.241 --> 00:35:01.170
<v Speaker 5>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

766
00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:04.950
<v Speaker 5>You got to take the hit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So now you've got to take the hit their</v>

767
00:35:04.951 --> 00:35:06.180
<v Speaker 5>fellow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can't do that.</v>

768
00:35:06.450 --> 00:35:08.700
<v Speaker 5>That's terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Somebody told me you better sell your</v>

769
00:35:08.701 --> 00:35:11.850
<v Speaker 5>toys are us stock right now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what I hear.</v>

770
00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:15.150
<v Speaker 5>But this thing about this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like when Ken,</v>

771
00:35:15.151 --> 00:35:15.984
<v Speaker 5>he</v>

772
00:35:16.590 --> 00:35:19.180
<v Speaker 6>like trade those stocks.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You have to wait cause that's what</v>

773
00:35:19.181 --> 00:35:20.710
<v Speaker 6>Martha Stewart got in trouble for it to</v>
<v Speaker 6>you.</v>

774
00:35:20.711 --> 00:35:23.020
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well she lied about doing it.</v>

775
00:35:23.410 --> 00:35:26.620
<v Speaker 6>She got like a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they found a note that had like the</v>

776
00:35:26.621 --> 00:35:30.100
<v Speaker 6>information on or something.</v>
<v Speaker 6>God Damn my memory's dog shit lately.</v>

777
00:35:30.310 --> 00:35:33.880
<v Speaker 6>It just real quick on the tax thing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think there is a limit but then that's</v>

778
00:35:33.881 --> 00:35:36.640
<v Speaker 6>why super pacs became a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So you can donate to another</v>

779
00:35:36.750 --> 00:35:39.810
<v Speaker 6>organization that's not directly to them</v>
<v Speaker 6>and the neck come back group and give</v>

780
00:35:39.811 --> 00:35:42.570
<v Speaker 6>the money as they say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh it's just a work around with like a</v>

781
00:35:42.571 --> 00:35:46.410
<v Speaker 6>loophole.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know what the limit is though?</v>

782
00:35:47.130 --> 00:35:52.110
<v Speaker 6>I believe it's 2,700 for an individual</v>
<v Speaker 6>and then there's like for a company can</v>

783
00:35:52.111 --> 00:35:55.950
<v Speaker 6>give like up to $10,000 or something.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So it's 2,700 for an individual.</v>

784
00:35:55.951 --> 00:35:57.270
<v Speaker 6>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 6>For election.</v>

785
00:35:57.830 --> 00:35:57.950
<v Speaker 6>Lot</v>

786
00:35:57.950 --> 00:36:01.040
<v Speaker 5>of money,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but not as much money as you would think</v>

787
00:36:01.041 --> 00:36:01.730
<v Speaker 5>it would be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

788
00:36:01.730 --> 00:36:03.320
<v Speaker 5>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you would think it'd be like a million.</v>

789
00:36:04.670 --> 00:36:05.503
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

790
00:36:05.580 --> 00:36:08.330
<v Speaker 5>there's a bunch of fucking wackadoos it</v>
<v Speaker 5>would give a million.</v>

791
00:36:08.570 --> 00:36:09.440
<v Speaker 5>The thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

792
00:36:09.860 --> 00:36:14.690
<v Speaker 5>there's weird things that happen with</v>
<v Speaker 5>politicians that you don't factor in</v>

793
00:36:14.691 --> 00:36:17.480
<v Speaker 5>when you think about bribery.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And one of the weird ones,</v>

794
00:36:17.481 --> 00:36:19.730
<v Speaker 5>his,</v>
<v Speaker 5>did you ever see that movie about the</v>

795
00:36:19.731 --> 00:36:22.550
<v Speaker 5>financial crisis?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

796
00:36:22.551 --> 00:36:26.380
<v Speaker 5>which one was it called?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hmm.</v>

797
00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:28.520
<v Speaker 5>Lot inside job.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Inside job.</v>

798
00:36:28.850 --> 00:36:31.100
<v Speaker 5>It's fucking amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But one of the things that had details</v>

799
00:36:31.101 --> 00:36:35.780
<v Speaker 5>is how many of these guys were</v>
<v Speaker 5>professors that were making these</v>

800
00:36:36.260 --> 00:36:40.520
<v Speaker 5>suggestions,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like working as consultants to the</v>

801
00:36:40.521 --> 00:36:43.940
<v Speaker 5>government making these suggestions that</v>
<v Speaker 5>why not to be horribly irresponsible</v>

802
00:36:43.941 --> 00:36:46.850
<v Speaker 5>financially.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then those guys get giant jobs</v>

803
00:36:47.030 --> 00:36:50.150
<v Speaker 5>afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It pay fucking millions of dollars and</v>

804
00:36:50.151 --> 00:36:51.320
<v Speaker 5>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wait a minute,</v>

805
00:36:51.380 --> 00:36:53.510
<v Speaker 5>what happened here?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're a professor,</v>

806
00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:56.220
<v Speaker 5>you made these sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

807
00:36:56.300 --> 00:36:59.840
<v Speaker 5>weird suggestions that if you looked at</v>
<v Speaker 5>like in the,</v>

808
00:36:59.841 --> 00:37:00.800
<v Speaker 5>in the movie,</v>
<v Speaker 5>inside job,</v>

809
00:37:00.801 --> 00:37:02.440
<v Speaker 5>he goes over it with these professors</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

810
00:37:02.441 --> 00:37:03.920
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how the fuck could you have thought</v>

811
00:37:03.921 --> 00:37:04.610
<v Speaker 5>this?</v>

812
00:37:04.610 --> 00:37:05.810
<v Speaker 5>Why did you push this?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

813
00:37:05.811 --> 00:37:07.910
<v Speaker 5>why were you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why were you guys promoting that?</v>

814
00:37:08.180 --> 00:37:11.960
<v Speaker 5>And then they go on to get these</v>
<v Speaker 5>gigantic fucking jobs at banks.</v>

815
00:37:12.500 --> 00:37:13.161
<v Speaker 5>And you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

816
00:37:13.161 --> 00:37:15.320
<v Speaker 5>this is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is like a clear path.</v>

817
00:37:15.470 --> 00:37:19.100
<v Speaker 5>Like do the right thing here and then</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're gonna make $5 million a year</v>

818
00:37:19.101 --> 00:37:22.510
<v Speaker 5>here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so they all do it and this movie's</v>

819
00:37:22.520 --> 00:37:26.180
<v Speaker 5>really good because in one of the scenes</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's talking to one of these big time</v>

820
00:37:26.181 --> 00:37:28.790
<v Speaker 5>bank guys and in the middle of talking</v>
<v Speaker 5>to him,</v>

821
00:37:28.791 --> 00:37:33.530
<v Speaker 5>the guy realizes what's going on and he</v>
<v Speaker 5>gets a real hostile but he keeps going.</v>

822
00:37:33.710 --> 00:37:36.050
<v Speaker 5>He like he,</v>
<v Speaker 5>his arrogance allows him to like keep</v>

823
00:37:36.051 --> 00:37:37.970
<v Speaker 5>battling sky,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it keeps like looking dumber and</v>

824
00:37:37.971 --> 00:37:40.670
<v Speaker 5>dumber because the guy who was doing the</v>
<v Speaker 5>interview is really good.</v>

825
00:37:40.671 --> 00:37:43.040
<v Speaker 5>The Guy who put together this</v>
<v Speaker 5>documentary is really good.</v>

826
00:37:43.490 --> 00:37:45.770
<v Speaker 5>It's an,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a fascinating documentary that</v>

827
00:37:45.771 --> 00:37:49.670
<v Speaker 5>gives you a real insight into how</v>
<v Speaker 5>complicated,</v>

828
00:37:49.940 --> 00:37:54.940
<v Speaker 5>complicated and fucking distorted the</v>
<v Speaker 5>system is.</v>

829
00:37:56.240 --> 00:37:59.510
<v Speaker 5>Like it's very distorted for those</v>
<v Speaker 5>people that are just like those rich</v>

830
00:37:59.511 --> 00:38:03.470
<v Speaker 5>banker guys.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All they're doing is moving money.</v>

831
00:38:04.100 --> 00:38:07.690
<v Speaker 5>I didn't have all that money and we do</v>
<v Speaker 5>put money over here and then get it</v>

832
00:38:07.691 --> 00:38:08.524
<v Speaker 5>over.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Pick it up.</v>

833
00:38:08.540 --> 00:38:10.120
<v Speaker 5>Aren't you glad you're not doing that</v>
<v Speaker 5>though?</v>

834
00:38:10.930 --> 00:38:12.380
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't understand it.</v>

835
00:38:13.310 --> 00:38:14.540
<v Speaker 5>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I couldn't,</v>

836
00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:17.300
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just can't imagine we still use it.</v>

837
00:38:17.660 --> 00:38:20.090
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure some of like Peter Shift could</v>

838
00:38:20.091 --> 00:38:21.650
<v Speaker 5>come in school me and explained it to</v>
<v Speaker 5>me,</v>

839
00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:26.920
<v Speaker 5>but I feel like it should be like one</v>
<v Speaker 5>goat equals one piece of gold.</v>

840
00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:31.790
<v Speaker 5>I think it's an issue go higher than</v>
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

841
00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:35.090
<v Speaker 5>It just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it soon as you get into speculation and</v>

842
00:38:36.970 --> 00:38:41.970
<v Speaker 1>shorting and oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>buying and selling stock in a company</v>

843
00:38:43.001 --> 00:38:45.700
<v Speaker 1>and a company can crash like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's like,</v>

844
00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:49.540
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately what's happened to babies</v>
<v Speaker 1>r us and toys r us is that they weren't</v>

845
00:38:49.541 --> 00:38:53.920
<v Speaker 1>getting killed by Amazon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just them taking debt in and like</v>

846
00:38:54.070 --> 00:38:56.860
<v Speaker 1>this finance company that bought them</v>
<v Speaker 1>just pretty much,</v>

847
00:38:56.890 --> 00:39:00.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>going crazy in depth,</v>

848
00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:01.960
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from bad spending.</v>

849
00:39:01.961 --> 00:39:04.750
<v Speaker 1>And it had nothing to do at the boys are</v>
<v Speaker 1>s's business.</v>

850
00:39:04.751 --> 00:39:07.090
<v Speaker 1>They were doing fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was all about the finance company</v>

851
00:39:07.091 --> 00:39:09.280
<v Speaker 1>that owned them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a sad thing man.</v>

852
00:39:09.310 --> 00:39:11.920
<v Speaker 1>But the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might be a good thing for like mom</v>

853
00:39:11.921 --> 00:39:13.750

<v Speaker 1>stores.</v>

<v Speaker 1>kids love to go to the fucking toy</v>

864
00:39:42.641 --> 00:39:44.920
<v Speaker 1>kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't replicate that online.</v>

865
00:39:44.921 --> 00:39:48.370
<v Speaker 1>It's just not the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're looking through amazon.com or</v>

866
00:39:48.371 --> 00:39:50.320
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's great that it's very convenient.</v>

867
00:39:50.321 --> 00:39:53.500
<v Speaker 1>You can just press,</v>
<v Speaker 1>press one click and have it sent to your</v>

868
00:39:53.501 --> 00:39:56.440
<v Speaker 1>house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But for toy stores in particular,</v>

869
00:39:56.560 --> 00:39:58.060
<v Speaker 1>this is a colossal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

870
00:39:58.080 --> 00:40:00.310
<v Speaker 1>there's an opening for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

871
00:40:00.311 --> 00:40:01.930
<v Speaker 1>for another company,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

872
00:40:01.931 --> 00:40:03.950
<v Speaker 1>this is the time to start a new toy</v>
<v Speaker 1>start.</v>

873
00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:05.590
<v Speaker 1>Cause Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at all the toy stores are gone.</v>

874
00:40:05.591 --> 00:40:08.080
<v Speaker 1>Like kb toys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember that in the mall that there was</v>

875
00:40:08.081 --> 00:40:10.930
<v Speaker 1>a toy store that was bought by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>company that bought toys are us.</v>

876
00:40:10.931 --> 00:40:13.540
<v Speaker 1>So that's gone too now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like all the toy stores are gone.</v>

877
00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:15.760
<v Speaker 1>There was a little place up here in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Calabasas.</v>

878
00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:19.030
<v Speaker 1>It was real nice man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Real tiny little mom and pop place had</v>

879
00:40:19.031 --> 00:40:21.280
<v Speaker 1>real cool toys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their kids used to love it,</v>

880
00:40:21.610 --> 00:40:24.670
<v Speaker 1>but the guy was telling me like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy or Gal want a woman?</v>

881
00:40:24.730 --> 00:40:27.430
<v Speaker 1>I'm a sexist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember who it was.</v>

882
00:40:27.850 --> 00:40:30.040
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking of my bid woman them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they were saying that no,</v>

883
00:40:30.041 --> 00:40:33.730
<v Speaker 1>it was a guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I remember he couldn't keep it open,</v>

884
00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:36.850
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to make money if he's only doing it for</v>

885
00:40:36.851 --> 00:40:40.480
<v Speaker 1>fun because he enjoyed it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just barely breaking even.</v>

886
00:40:40.540 --> 00:40:43.360
<v Speaker 1>But it's probably one of those toy</v>
<v Speaker 1>stores where it was mostly like puppets</v>

887
00:40:43.361 --> 00:40:44.350
<v Speaker 1>and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you know,</v>

888
00:40:44.380 --> 00:40:47.320
<v Speaker 1>educational toys and it wasn't like Gi</v>
<v Speaker 1>joes.</v>

889
00:40:47.321 --> 00:40:49.780
<v Speaker 1>They had everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had a lot of stuff.</v>

890
00:40:49.781 --> 00:40:53.230
<v Speaker 1>They had regular like action figures for</v>
<v Speaker 1>comic books and stuff like that.</v>

891
00:40:53.350 --> 00:40:54.183
<v Speaker 1>What are you doing?</v>

892
00:40:54.370 --> 00:40:56.530
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this documentary on Netflix</v>

893
00:40:56.531 --> 00:41:01.060
<v Speaker 1>right now called the toys that made us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's very interesting and like you</v>

894
00:41:01.061 --> 00:41:03.550
<v Speaker 1>learn so much like I showed the history</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Barbie,</v>

895
00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:06.760
<v Speaker 1>Barbie started off as a hooker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it was a hooker doll.</v>

896
00:41:06.820 --> 00:41:08.860
<v Speaker 1>The in Germany.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come on.</v>

897
00:41:08.930 --> 00:41:09.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Swear to God.</v>

898
00:41:09.700 --> 00:41:12.430
<v Speaker 1>Like they uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Google please.</v>

899
00:41:12.431 --> 00:41:13.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was this tree,</v>

900
00:41:13.641 --> 00:41:16.540
<v Speaker 1>that Barbie doll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a doll that looked exactly</v>

901
00:41:16.541 --> 00:41:20.650
<v Speaker 1>like Barbie that they used to guys used</v>
<v Speaker 1>to like carry around and give to women.</v>

902
00:41:20.651 --> 00:41:24.310
<v Speaker 1>And it was like a way of like a flirting</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a woman.</v>

903
00:41:24.311 --> 00:41:24.890
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey I,</v>

<v Speaker 1>later I want.</v>

905
00:41:28.120 --> 00:41:33.120
<v Speaker 1>And so this person came over to Germany</v>
<v Speaker 1>and solve this doll and modeled Barbie</v>

906
00:41:33.830 --> 00:41:34.100
<v Speaker 1>right</v>

907
00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:37.100
<v Speaker 3>after this hooker doll.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so if you look at the original</v>

908
00:41:37.101 --> 00:41:39.500
<v Speaker 3>Barbie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what it was modeled off of it was</v>

909
00:41:39.501 --> 00:41:43.230
<v Speaker 3>just like a creepy looking hooker chick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure you can find a picture.</v>

910
00:41:43.670 --> 00:41:46.310

<v Speaker 3>star wars toy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

943
00:42:58.830 --> 00:43:00.490
<v Speaker 3>well here's this little pussy doll.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

944
00:43:01.030 --> 00:43:03.790
<v Speaker 3>so and then they made a cartoon around</v>
<v Speaker 3>it and uh,</v>

945
00:43:04.210 --> 00:43:06.730
<v Speaker 3>it's really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you wouldn't think it would be that</v>

946
00:43:06.731 --> 00:43:08.410
<v Speaker 3>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But even the Barbie part,</v>

947
00:43:08.590 --> 00:43:09.401
<v Speaker 3>it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

948
00:43:09.401 --> 00:43:12.040
<v Speaker 3>this is fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And how they changed barbies.</v>

<v Speaker 3>waist is really small and light stuff.</v>

951
00:43:19.570 --> 00:43:23.050
<v Speaker 3>That's because when you put clothes on</v>
<v Speaker 3>for it to fit and look right,</v>

952
00:43:23.051 --> 00:43:24.780
<v Speaker 3>that's how they had to make her waist</v>
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>

953
00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:27.220
<v Speaker 3>it was more for like the style of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>clothes she was wearing,</v>

<v Speaker 5>cause he's the only ones who care.</v>

1035
00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:24.820
<v Speaker 5>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bird Tom at birth.</v>

1036
00:47:24.850 --> 00:47:28.720
<v Speaker 5>That was a different kind of fat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They got locked up because people found</v>

1037
00:47:28.721 --> 00:47:30.130
<v Speaker 5>it a target like,</v>

1038
00:47:30.130 --> 00:47:32.200
<v Speaker 2>oh well it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's figure out what we can say here.</v>

1039
00:47:32.201 --> 00:47:37.201
<v Speaker 2>Oh it's fat shaming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But just genuinely unlike untrue,</v>

1040
00:47:37.470 --> 00:47:42.190
<v Speaker 2>like with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>without it ever being requested by</v>

1041
00:47:42.191 --> 00:47:45.160
<v Speaker 2>someone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you just on your own,</v>

1042
00:47:45.790 --> 00:47:48.190
<v Speaker 2>you decided that to say that's fat</v>
<v Speaker 2>shaming.</v>

1043
00:47:48.220 --> 00:47:50.770
<v Speaker 2>Like you saw it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you pointed out and it became an issue</v>

1044
00:47:50.920 --> 00:47:54.340
<v Speaker 2>about a public event or a public person</v>
<v Speaker 2>or a public celebrity said,</v>

1045
00:47:54.341 --> 00:47:55.750
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm being fat shamed,</v>

1046
00:47:55.930 --> 00:48:00.580
<v Speaker 2>and it was a man fucking never tested.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It means that it hasn't happened.</v>

1047
00:48:00.581 --> 00:48:02.860
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it has an ID.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have been paying attention,</v>

1048
00:48:03.430 --> 00:48:06.880
<v Speaker 2>but I can't imagine that some guy would</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking complaint because he has a gut</v>

1049
00:48:07.210 --> 00:48:10.660
<v Speaker 2>and someone's fat shaming them publicly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He would just look at that gut and go,</v>

1050
00:48:10.661 --> 00:48:13.240
<v Speaker 2>fuck the right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got to stop eating.</v>

1051
00:48:14.050 --> 00:48:16.660
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the Tom at birth thing,</v>

1052
00:48:17.080 --> 00:48:19.180
<v Speaker 2>people really did think they were</v>
<v Speaker 2>serious.</v>

1053
00:48:19.210 --> 00:48:22.150
<v Speaker 2>That's where it got weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like people would get angry at Bert or</v>

1054
00:48:22.151 --> 00:48:26.020
<v Speaker 2>angry at Tom and they'll pick sides,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but was telling me about this the other</v>

1055
00:48:26.021 --> 00:48:27.970
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He hired me to like drive him on this</v>

1056
00:48:27.971 --> 00:48:32.560
<v Speaker 2>golf cart for this marathon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like in between taking instagram photos</v>

1057
00:48:32.580 --> 00:48:37.580
<v Speaker 2>like you imagine you get mad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I found out.</v>

1058
00:48:39.040 --> 00:48:43.580
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He ran five 33 that's pretty good.</v>

1059
00:48:43.581 --> 00:48:46.360
<v Speaker 2>That's pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>An hour slower than oprah,</v>

1060
00:48:46.660 --> 00:48:48.940
<v Speaker 2>but hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's fat and he drinks a lot.</v>

1061
00:48:49.040 --> 00:48:51.700
<v Speaker 2>What's interesting is like the guy that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first place guy,</v>

1062
00:48:51.701 --> 00:48:53.680
<v Speaker 2>the guy that actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know one,</v>

1063
00:48:53.860 --> 00:48:56.070
<v Speaker 2>it was like two and a half hours and</v>
<v Speaker 2>says no,</v>

1064
00:48:56.230 --> 00:48:59.260
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no ones is it that can't be,</v>

1065
00:48:59.580 --> 00:49:00.430
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an interest.</v>

1066
00:49:00.440 --> 00:49:02.440
<v Speaker 2>So it's two hours that they can't break.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1067
00:49:02.441 --> 00:49:03.980
<v Speaker 2>They can't break two hours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1068
00:49:04.930 --> 00:49:09.930
<v Speaker 2>I was thinking that it's two years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so like two 1146 that's what he did.</v>

1069
00:49:10.420 --> 00:49:11.830
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the same what?</v>

1070
00:49:11.831 --> 00:49:14.550
<v Speaker 2>Burt was five and a half.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's insane.</v>

1071
00:49:14.560 --> 00:49:15.790
<v Speaker 2>Runs so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so fast.</v>

1072
00:49:15.791 --> 00:49:16.900
<v Speaker 2>That's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't,</v>

1073
00:49:16.901 --> 00:49:19.420
<v Speaker 2>I've tried to run that fast for like a</v>
<v Speaker 2>mile.</v>

1074
00:49:20.730 --> 00:49:22.180
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>

1075
00:49:22.270 --> 00:49:24.130
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know they did it that fast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought like,</v>

1076
00:49:24.730 --> 00:49:27.700
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I was guessing when you said two 30</v>

1077
00:49:27.701 --> 00:49:29.680
<v Speaker 2>or whatever the fuck we thought it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would be like,</v>

1078
00:49:29.681 --> 00:49:31.300
<v Speaker 2>well that's like a world record or some</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>

1079
00:49:32.110 --> 00:49:34.060
<v Speaker 2>What did it used to be?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Didn't it used to be three hours,</v>

1080
00:49:34.061 --> 00:49:35.490
<v Speaker 2>like a big deal?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1081
00:49:35.491 --> 00:49:36.370
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1082
00:49:36.371 --> 00:49:38.110
<v Speaker 2>it was like a three minute mile is the</v>
<v Speaker 2>big deal.</v>

1083
00:49:38.650 --> 00:49:39.880
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>four minute mile.</v>

1084
00:49:39.881 --> 00:49:43.580
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then easiest came out and changed him.</v>

1085
00:49:43.620 --> 00:49:45.980
<v Speaker 2>Easiest changed the game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got so much more bounce.</v>

1086
00:49:46.510 --> 00:49:50.440
<v Speaker 2>How about this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go back to the world record marathon.</v>

1087
00:49:50.530 --> 00:49:52.660
<v Speaker 2>A world record.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Boston Marathon,</v>

1088
00:49:52.661 --> 00:49:56.080
<v Speaker 2>1980 I have a feeling it's like in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>threes.</v>

1089
00:49:56.530 --> 00:49:58.110
<v Speaker 2>It probably is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1090
00:49:58.120 --> 00:50:01.510
<v Speaker 2>just wouldn't be world record.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Boston marathon.</v>

1091
00:50:01.511 --> 00:50:05.230
<v Speaker 2>That's a stupid thing to say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a possum marathon record.</v>

1092
00:50:05.550 --> 00:50:10.330
<v Speaker 2>Who's the who want it to someone in</v>
<v Speaker 2>20001120302 yeah,</v>

1093
00:50:10.331 --> 00:50:14.920
<v Speaker 2>but that's 2011 I want to go down in</v>
<v Speaker 2>1980 and 19 old record.</v>

1094
00:50:15.100 --> 00:50:16.630
<v Speaker 2>It's been replaced.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

1095
00:50:16.660 --> 00:50:20.140
<v Speaker 2>but not the record.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just like what is the result from 1980</v>

1096
00:50:20.141 --> 00:50:22.840
<v Speaker 2>Boston marathon result in 1980 I want</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

1097
00:50:22.841 --> 00:50:27.841
<v Speaker 2>I want to say that was probably the last</v>
<v Speaker 2>time I paid attention because I lived in</v>

1098
00:50:28.341 --> 00:50:31.610
<v Speaker 2>Boston.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't give a fuck about the La</v>

1099
00:50:31.610 --> 00:50:33.110
<v Speaker 2>Marathon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hear about it and I go,</v>

1100
00:50:33.111 --> 00:50:34.610
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can't drive there now,</v>

1101
00:50:35.120 --> 00:50:36.200

<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1102
00:50:36.201 --> 00:50:38.270
<v Speaker 2>what a smart thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These people were all running on the</v>

1103
00:50:38.271 --> 00:50:41.900
<v Speaker 2>street.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the reason why you're</v>

1104
00:50:41.901 --> 00:50:44.810
<v Speaker 2>remembering that it's because that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>when the woman faked the time.</v>

1105
00:50:45.380 --> 00:50:46.610
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>

1106
00:50:47.990 --> 00:50:50.120
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forgot about her.</v>

1107
00:50:50.150 --> 00:50:52.160
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was 1980.</v>

1108
00:50:53.300 --> 00:50:56.150
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well she hopped on the tee and they</v>

1109
00:50:56.151 --> 00:50:59.930
<v Speaker 2>busted or people saw her on the tea.</v>

1111
00:51:03.620 --> 00:51:06.260
<v Speaker 2>Wouldn't just show it the pain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember it.</v>

1112
00:51:06.290 --> 00:51:10.790

<v Speaker 2>Reebok's.</v>

1147
00:52:41.691 --> 00:52:45.530
<v Speaker 2>shoe that they created just so that</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone could break two hours and see a</v>

1148
00:52:45.531 --> 00:52:46.430
<v Speaker 2>bird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Could be the one.</v>

1149
00:52:46.490 --> 00:52:48.680
<v Speaker 2>It's supposedly shaves like 4% off of</v>
<v Speaker 2>your time.</v>

1150
00:52:48.710 --> 00:52:50.720
<v Speaker 2>That showed the fuck out of here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How is that possible?</v>

1151
00:52:50.920 --> 00:52:52.610
<v Speaker 2>There's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>titanium is crazy.</v>

1152
00:52:52.850 --> 00:52:56.900
<v Speaker 2>It means you run a hundred miles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get there for mild quicker than you</v>

1153
00:52:56.901 --> 00:52:58.820
<v Speaker 2>did without that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That shit's ridiculous.</v>

1154
00:52:59.120 --> 00:53:02.630
<v Speaker 2>There's a titanium plate in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's supposed to help propel you</v>

1155
00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:05.400
<v Speaker 2>springs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You run it on spraying.</v>

1156
00:53:05.401 --> 00:53:07.640
<v Speaker 2>So remember those air shocks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those Nike Shox,</v>

1157
00:53:07.670 --> 00:53:11.270
<v Speaker 2>you'd have springs in your heels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look like frog shares.</v>

1158
00:53:12.170 --> 00:53:14.030
<v Speaker 2>I mean a beating this dead horse many</v>
<v Speaker 2>times.</v>

1159
00:53:14.120 --> 00:53:18.080
<v Speaker 2>Not a bad idea of beat it one more time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I like barefoot running.</v>

1160
00:53:18.890 --> 00:53:23.780
<v Speaker 2>I run with the smallest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tiniest amount of soul and it's changed</v>

1161
00:53:23.781 --> 00:53:26.130
<v Speaker 2>my feet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I used to get ice</v>

1162
00:53:26.130 --> 00:53:29.910
<v Speaker 5>of completely flat feet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So if like I stepped in water and then I</v>

1163
00:53:29.911 --> 00:53:32.670
<v Speaker 5>stepped like on the tile,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like next to the pool,</v>

1164
00:53:33.030 --> 00:53:35.550
<v Speaker 5>it feels like symantec or something that</v>
<v Speaker 5>we could see my footprint.</v>

1165
00:53:35.580 --> 00:53:38.280
<v Speaker 5>You would see a flat cave band</v>
<v Speaker 5>footprint.</v>

1166
00:53:38.281 --> 00:53:41.400
<v Speaker 5>Same.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But since I've been running with these,</v>

1167
00:53:41.670 --> 00:53:44.640
<v Speaker 5>those are used,</v>
<v Speaker 5>those vibrams four fingers shoes and I</v>

1168
00:53:44.641 --> 00:53:46.260
<v Speaker 5>use a couple of different,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1169
00:53:46.950 --> 00:53:48.360
<v Speaker 5>the vose.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I like those,</v>

1170
00:53:48.390 --> 00:53:50.520
<v Speaker 5>those are,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they have real good traction in them.</v>

1171
00:53:50.580 --> 00:53:52.170
<v Speaker 5>What about the impact on your knees</v>
<v Speaker 5>though?</v>

1172
00:53:52.190 --> 00:53:53.970
<v Speaker 5>And your joints are running on the ball.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're foot,</v>

1173
00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:58.620
<v Speaker 5>you're foot is a natural shock absorber</v>
<v Speaker 5>to thing is people change the way they</v>

1174
00:53:58.621 --> 00:54:03.621
<v Speaker 5>ran in the 1970s when Nike came out with</v>
<v Speaker 5>that really thick heel for those running</v>

1175
00:54:03.991 --> 00:54:07.740
<v Speaker 5>shoes and the idea was that you would</v>
<v Speaker 5>land on the heel and then go for it.</v>

1176
00:54:07.741 --> 00:54:09.630
<v Speaker 5>But that's a terrible way for your foot</v>
<v Speaker 5>to land.</v>

1177
00:54:09.660 --> 00:54:12.000
<v Speaker 5>That's all the shock goes straight to</v>
<v Speaker 5>your knee.</v>

1178
00:54:12.150 --> 00:54:15.480
<v Speaker 5>There's no give there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The only give would be the cushioning of</v>

1179
00:54:15.481 --> 00:54:18.510
<v Speaker 5>the shoe,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but your foot is naturally designed to</v>

1180
00:54:18.511 --> 00:54:20.430
<v Speaker 5>decelerate.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You land on the ball,</v>

1181
00:54:20.431 --> 00:54:22.710
<v Speaker 5>your feet,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your foot decelerates and you go</v>

1182
00:54:22.711 --> 00:54:25.530
<v Speaker 5>forward.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And what it's done is strengthen all the</v>

1183
00:54:25.531 --> 00:54:30.531
<v Speaker 5>muscles in my feet in a crazy way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I mean there's a big difference,</v>

1184
00:54:30.660 --> 00:54:35.070
<v Speaker 5>like a big difference and my legs just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they just work better,</v>

1185
00:54:35.370 --> 00:54:38.190
<v Speaker 5>like a more balanced,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's so crazy like it's,</v>

1186
00:54:38.420 --> 00:54:40.290
<v Speaker 5>it's changed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I think about this,</v>

1187
00:54:40.291 --> 00:54:44.040
<v Speaker 5>I'm like if I was doing this back when I</v>
<v Speaker 5>was like really involved in martial</v>

1188
00:54:44.041 --> 00:54:45.710
<v Speaker 5>arts,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it would've changed my footwork.</v>

1189
00:54:45.950 --> 00:54:49.080
<v Speaker 5>It would have made my,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my movement in and out better and faster</v>

1190
00:54:49.230 --> 00:54:51.560
<v Speaker 5>cause like your feet strength.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The,</v>

1191
00:54:51.570 --> 00:54:53.790
<v Speaker 5>they'd be,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your fee becomes so much stronger when</v>

1192
00:54:53.791 --> 00:54:55.950
<v Speaker 5>you run hills with no shoes on.</v>

1193
00:54:55.980 --> 00:54:57.630
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's basically,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's shoes,</v>

1194
00:54:57.631 --> 00:55:00.060
<v Speaker 5>there's a thin tread,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there's no cushioning.</v>

1195
00:55:00.500 --> 00:55:04.140
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's all just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the tread is like a layer of protection</v>

1196
00:55:04.141 --> 00:55:05.970
<v Speaker 5>from sharp rocks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's it.</v>

1197
00:55:05.971 --> 00:55:07.210
<v Speaker 5>You're going to try these.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1198
00:55:07.270 --> 00:55:10.740
<v Speaker 5>I have those in my ass right now and we</v>
<v Speaker 5>pull it out.</v>

1199
00:55:11.510 --> 00:55:13.650
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>go pull up Vivo,</v>

1200
00:55:13.651 --> 00:55:16.740
<v Speaker 5>barefoot trail running shoes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>These are the ones that I've been using</v>

1201
00:55:16.741 --> 00:55:19.050
<v Speaker 5>a lot lately and the vibrams five</v>
<v Speaker 5>fingers.</v>

1202
00:55:19.500 --> 00:55:21.300
<v Speaker 5>But the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the problem with the vibrams is they</v>

1203
00:55:21.301 --> 00:55:25.440
<v Speaker 5>don't have as much tread and um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when it's muddy,</v>

1204
00:55:25.800 --> 00:55:29.100
<v Speaker 5>you slide all over the fucking place.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I don't want to fuck my knees up.</v>

1205
00:55:29.460 --> 00:55:30.090
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>

1206
00:55:30.090 --> 00:55:32.520
<v Speaker 5>that's not those,</v>
<v Speaker 5>those are like Ninja toes.</v>

1207
00:55:32.670 --> 00:55:33.660
<v Speaker 5>Hoy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Aw.</v>

1208
00:55:34.050 --> 00:55:35.820
<v Speaker 5>Have you tried running barefoot on the</v>
<v Speaker 5>beach yet?</v>

1209
00:55:35.940 --> 00:55:37.020
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've done.</v>

1210
00:55:37.021 --> 00:55:38.820
<v Speaker 5>That.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Has Gotten better for you since you've</v>

1211
00:55:38.821 --> 00:55:40.140
<v Speaker 5>done that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1212
00:55:40.200 --> 00:55:41.910
<v Speaker 5>Well it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everything's better.</v>

1213
00:55:41.910 --> 00:55:44.570
<v Speaker 5>What's interesting is that's what it</v>
<v Speaker 5>looks like on the bottom of those.</v>

1214
00:55:44.590 --> 00:55:46.680
<v Speaker 5>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's a good tread on the bottom and</v>

1215
00:55:46.681 --> 00:55:49.920
<v Speaker 5>it protects you from sharp rocks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But that that shoe is super,</v>

1216
00:55:49.921 --> 00:55:52.380
<v Speaker 5>super flexible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you have to trail specific one?</v>

1217
00:55:52.890 --> 00:55:54.840
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because that's all I'm running on.</v>

1218
00:55:54.841 --> 00:55:58.950
<v Speaker 5>I'm not running on any hard ground and I</v>
<v Speaker 5>have zero problems with my knees.</v>

1219
00:55:59.040 --> 00:56:00.210
<v Speaker 5>Zero,</v>
<v Speaker 5>zero.</v>

1220
00:56:00.211 --> 00:56:04.140
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes my ankles are a little,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm a little stiff,</v>

1221
00:56:04.170 --> 00:56:06.600
<v Speaker 5>like sometimes they're little still sore</v>
<v Speaker 5>when I first start running,</v>

1222
00:56:07.020 --> 00:56:07.710
<v Speaker 5>but I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1223
00:56:07.710 --> 00:56:08.610
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Duh.</v>

1224
00:56:08.640 --> 00:56:10.610
<v Speaker 5>Think about all the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the beating I'm giving them as her.</v>

1225
00:56:10.611 --> 00:56:12.510
<v Speaker 5>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was the ones that were now,</v>

1226
00:56:13.200 --> 00:56:15.180
<v Speaker 5>but right now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as soon as it dries up,</v>

1227
00:56:15.210 --> 00:56:16.440
<v Speaker 5>because it's been raining a lot out</v>
<v Speaker 5>here,</v>

1228
00:56:16.710 --> 00:56:19.070
<v Speaker 5>soon as it dries up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll go back to those vibram five</v>

1229
00:56:19.071 --> 00:56:23.220
<v Speaker 5>fingers because those things make you</v>
<v Speaker 5>use your toes,</v>

1230
00:56:23.470 --> 00:56:28.090
<v Speaker 5>like your shoe is in a coffin man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like your or your foot rather in your</v>

1231
00:56:28.091 --> 00:56:28.450
<v Speaker 5>shoe.</v>

1232
00:56:28.450 --> 00:56:29.680
<v Speaker 5>Is it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like a coffin.</v>

1233
00:56:29.890 --> 00:56:31.720
<v Speaker 5>It wraps it up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It locks it down.</v>

1234
00:56:31.721 --> 00:56:34.570
<v Speaker 5>It's a cast and your feet don't move.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1235
00:56:34.750 --> 00:56:37.570
<v Speaker 5>They don't spread out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Your toes don't grip into the ground and</v>

1236
00:56:37.571 --> 00:56:40.420
<v Speaker 5>push off.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And Steve Maxwell was the first one to</v>

1237
00:56:40.421 --> 00:56:43.630
<v Speaker 5>tell me about that when in in regards to</v>
<v Speaker 5>weightlifting,</v>

1238
00:56:43.930 --> 00:56:45.940
<v Speaker 5>he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you should wait live barefoot and if you</v>

1239
00:56:45.941 --> 00:56:48.670
<v Speaker 5>don't want to wait with barefoot where</v>
<v Speaker 5>those like five finger shoes.</v>

1240
00:56:49.150 --> 00:56:51.370
<v Speaker 5>And as soon as I started doing that I</v>
<v Speaker 5>started realizing like,</v>

1241
00:56:51.400 --> 00:56:52.233
<v Speaker 5>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like you,</v>

1242
00:56:52.420 --> 00:56:56.410
<v Speaker 5>you push off those toes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you feel them dig into the ground and,</v>

1243
00:56:56.450 --> 00:56:57.310
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

1244
00:56:57.311 --> 00:57:01.450
<v Speaker 5>and certain exercises.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But if they're all trapped up in a shoe,</v>

1245
00:57:01.510 --> 00:57:03.490
<v Speaker 5>it's like it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they don't move.</v>

1246
00:57:03.491 --> 00:57:06.100
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just they don't expand.</v>

1247
00:57:06.340 --> 00:57:08.800
<v Speaker 5>They don't grip the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They don't look,</v>

1248
00:57:08.980 --> 00:57:11.830
<v Speaker 5>they don't dig in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But when you're running barefoot,</v>

1249
00:57:11.831 --> 00:57:12.810
<v Speaker 5>like my,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my,</v>

1250
00:57:12.970 --> 00:57:16.820
<v Speaker 5>like I feel the muscles in my feet,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they like afterwards,</v>

1251
00:57:16.821 --> 00:57:18.010
<v Speaker 5>like they get worked out.</v>

1252
00:57:18.310 --> 00:57:19.450
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like those kinds of things.</v>

1253
00:57:21.100 --> 00:57:22.840
<v Speaker 5>That's exactly what those are.</v>
<v Speaker 5>City ones,</v>

1254
00:57:22.841 --> 00:57:24.160
<v Speaker 5>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Those are the ones for wearing around</v>

1255
00:57:24.161 --> 00:57:25.090
<v Speaker 5>the city.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look,</v>

1256
00:57:25.091 --> 00:57:27.610
<v Speaker 5>they look gross.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's no doubt about it.</v>

1257
00:57:27.820 --> 00:57:29.680
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're used to looking at different</v>

1258
00:57:29.681 --> 00:57:32.230
<v Speaker 5>kinds of shoes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You look at that little tiny slipper</v>

1259
00:57:32.231 --> 00:57:33.850
<v Speaker 5>thing on a dude's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>

1260
00:57:34.090 --> 00:57:36.880
<v Speaker 5>get out of here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What your weird ideas with your fucking</v>

1261
00:57:36.881 --> 00:57:38.770
<v Speaker 5>slipper feet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it's just something you got to get</v>

1262
00:57:38.771 --> 00:57:42.190
<v Speaker 5>used to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I prefer them now and if I don't wear</v>

1263
00:57:42.191 --> 00:57:44.620
<v Speaker 5>those,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I usually wear shit like this.</v>

1264
00:57:44.621 --> 00:57:47.830
<v Speaker 5>Like converse all stars because there's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's nothing there.</v>

1265
00:57:47.831 --> 00:57:50.170
<v Speaker 5>There's an,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like it's totally flat.</v>

1266
00:57:50.200 --> 00:57:52.030
<v Speaker 5>You don't have a raised,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he'll see like that.</v>

1267
00:57:52.031 --> 00:57:54.630
<v Speaker 5>She right there has a raised he air Max</v>
<v Speaker 5>right there.</v>

1268
00:57:54.640 --> 00:57:55.210
<v Speaker 5>Fat,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1269
00:57:55.210 --> 00:57:55.840
<v Speaker 5>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1270
00:57:55.840 --> 00:57:57.340
<v Speaker 5>but those,</v>
<v Speaker 5>those heels,</v>

1271
00:57:57.370 --> 00:58:00.130
<v Speaker 5>that raised heel,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it shortens your achilles tendon.</v>

1272
00:58:01.420 --> 00:58:03.490
<v Speaker 5>If you wear those all the time and</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're,</v>

1273
00:58:03.491 --> 00:58:05.740
<v Speaker 5>or wear high heels all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>think about it.</v>

1274
00:58:06.150 --> 00:58:09.760
<v Speaker 5>You are foot is always in this weird</v>
<v Speaker 5>position where your back,</v>

1275
00:58:09.761 --> 00:58:13.930
<v Speaker 5>the back heel is elevated.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you're 10 is not traveling as far.</v>

1276
00:58:14.230 --> 00:58:17.140
<v Speaker 5>So then when you do something where it</v>
<v Speaker 5>does have to travel far,</v>

1277
00:58:17.170 --> 00:58:19.900
<v Speaker 5>it can get ruptured like you'd have,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can have issues with it.</v>

1278
00:58:20.500 --> 00:58:21.550
<v Speaker 5>It's just not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not.</v>

1279
00:58:21.551 --> 00:58:24.520
<v Speaker 5>It's like you ever heard of like people</v>
<v Speaker 5>that drive cars a lot and they have a</v>

1280
00:58:24.521 --> 00:58:27.280
<v Speaker 5>big fat wallet,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they wind up getting problems with their</v>

1281
00:58:27.281 --> 00:58:30.490
<v Speaker 5>back.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like they'll get a disc slippage because</v>

1282
00:58:30.580 --> 00:58:33.010
<v Speaker 5>you know they're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're kind of getting a bulging disks.</v>

1283
00:58:33.011 --> 00:58:38.011
<v Speaker 5>They're always leaning on one side.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're doing your body a disservice by</v>

1284
00:58:38.441 --> 00:58:42.100
<v Speaker 5>keeping it in an in an unnatural</v>
<v Speaker 5>position or in any sort of static</v>

1285
00:58:42.101 --> 00:58:46.120
<v Speaker 5>position for long periods of time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So when you have a static position like</v>

1286
00:58:46.360 --> 00:58:48.790
<v Speaker 5>sitting with a big fat wallet and your</v>
<v Speaker 5>ass,</v>

1287
00:58:48.820 --> 00:58:50.680
<v Speaker 5>it eventually starts to break you down.</v>

1288
00:58:50.890 --> 00:58:54.160
<v Speaker 5>The argument is that that same kind of</v>
<v Speaker 5>shit is happening with heels.</v>

1289
00:58:54.460 --> 00:58:57.160
<v Speaker 5>So if you're wearing a sneaker that has</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a heel to it,</v>

1290
00:58:57.700 --> 00:59:00.640
<v Speaker 5>that you are constantly,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially if you're doing explosive</v>

1291
00:59:00.641 --> 00:59:03.670
<v Speaker 5>exercises,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're constantly limiting the range of</v>

1292
00:59:03.671 --> 00:59:05.290
<v Speaker 5>your heel.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Does that make sense?</v>

1293
00:59:05.440 --> 00:59:06.440
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My,</v>

1294
00:59:06.470 --> 00:59:07.990
<v Speaker 5>my,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my thing though is that because I also</v>

1295
00:59:07.991 --> 00:59:11.860
<v Speaker 5>have bad flat flat feet that if I have</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a congress all star,</v>

1296
00:59:12.010 --> 00:59:14.440
<v Speaker 5>I feel like I need more support cause I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it makes me walk right.</v>

1297
00:59:14.460 --> 00:59:15.720
<v Speaker 5>Pig Pig,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1298
00:59:15.830 --> 00:59:18.790
<v Speaker 5>pitch a tent or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think that's true.</v>

1299
00:59:18.880 --> 00:59:20.680
<v Speaker 5>I think you probably just need to</v>
<v Speaker 5>strengthen your feet.</v>

1300
00:59:20.770 --> 00:59:22.550
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think,</v>

1301
00:59:23.990 --> 00:59:26.990
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just don't think that that's where you</v>

1302
00:59:26.991 --> 00:59:28.280
<v Speaker 5>get support from.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1303
00:59:28.281 --> 00:59:30.440
<v Speaker 5>you do get support from that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you go on mountaineering or</v>

1304
00:59:30.441 --> 00:59:31.940
<v Speaker 5>something,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know you have to hike.</v>

1305
00:59:32.030 --> 00:59:35.780
<v Speaker 5>But if you're looking for like an</v>
<v Speaker 5>overall solution should try to get your</v>

1306
00:59:35.781 --> 00:59:36.730
<v Speaker 5>feet stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1307
00:59:38.090 --> 00:59:39.620
<v Speaker 5>Doctors,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that Doctor Scholl thing,</v>

1308
00:59:39.621 --> 00:59:42.890
<v Speaker 5>you can do it up like put your foot on</v>
<v Speaker 5>it and it tests your walking gait and</v>

1309
00:59:42.891 --> 00:59:45.830
<v Speaker 5>they give you the proper insole.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This kind of help a little bit.</v>

1310
00:59:46.100 --> 00:59:47.690
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>those insoles will definitely help your</v>

1311
00:59:47.691 --> 00:59:48.750
<v Speaker 5>comfort level.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1312
00:59:48.860 --> 00:59:51.320
<v Speaker 5>The thing is like what's causing the</v>
<v Speaker 5>discomfort?</v>

1313
00:59:51.410 --> 00:59:54.920
<v Speaker 5>Is it a lack of strength?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is it a lack of mobility?</v>

1314
00:59:54.950 --> 00:59:56.180
<v Speaker 5>Like what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what are the issues?</v>

1315
00:59:56.181 --> 00:59:58.100
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so it's like if you're going to go</v>

1316
00:59:58.101 --> 00:59:59.770
<v Speaker 5>mountaineering next week,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all right,</v>

1317
00:59:59.810 --> 01:00:02.420
<v Speaker 5>you should definitely go and get some</v>
<v Speaker 5>fitted in souls.</v>

1318
01:00:02.630 --> 01:00:04.760
<v Speaker 5>You could,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you should go get some stiff ass boots</v>

1319
01:00:04.761 --> 01:00:07.040
<v Speaker 5>that you know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean that's definitely the way to go,</v>

1320
01:00:07.070 --> 01:00:08.360
<v Speaker 5>even if you're mountaineering,</v>
<v Speaker 5>period.</v>

1321
01:00:08.780 --> 01:00:12.380
<v Speaker 5>But if we're not talking about that you</v>
<v Speaker 5>want to talk about like a solution for</v>

1322
01:00:12.381 --> 01:00:14.450
<v Speaker 5>your life,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like why do your feet hurt when you do</v>

1323
01:00:14.451 --> 01:00:14.750
<v Speaker 5>things?</v>

1324
01:00:14.750 --> 01:00:18.470
<v Speaker 5>Why it might very well be they're not</v>
<v Speaker 5>conditioned well and they're not,</v>

1325
01:00:18.500 --> 01:00:23.090
<v Speaker 5>they're not being used correctly because</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're shoving them into these fucking</v>

1326
01:00:23.091 --> 01:00:28.091
<v Speaker 5>casts that we call sneakers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hippy talk one on one and my sneakers</v>

1327
01:00:29.181 --> 01:00:31.340
<v Speaker 5>have this new material that's been a lot</v>
<v Speaker 5>of shoots for a while,</v>

1328
01:00:31.341 --> 01:00:34.070
<v Speaker 5>but this like fly net material.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it stretches with your foot.</v>

1329
01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:35.640
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Good.</v>

1330
01:00:35.960 --> 01:00:37.350
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean you don't have to,</v>

1331
01:00:37.370 --> 01:00:40.130
<v Speaker 5>they don't need breaking in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like she was kind of did for a long time</v>

1332
01:00:40.131 --> 01:00:42.140
<v Speaker 5>in the 80s nineties whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Don't get me wrong man.</v>

1333
01:00:42.141 --> 01:00:44.930
<v Speaker 5>I'll still wear a pair of running shoes</v>
<v Speaker 5>every now and then if I feel are good,</v>

1334
01:00:45.290 --> 01:00:47.540
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I just don't think they should be</v>

1335
01:00:47.541 --> 01:00:49.580
<v Speaker 5>worn every day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think it's a normal thing.</v>

1336
01:00:49.990 --> 01:00:51.320
<v Speaker 5>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I definitely don't think you should work</v>

1337
01:00:51.321 --> 01:00:54.650
<v Speaker 5>out in them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like in terms of like running in them.</v>

1338
01:00:54.650 --> 01:00:58.580
<v Speaker 5>And a lot of the shit that people do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean there's,</v>

1339
01:00:58.700 --> 01:01:02.570
<v Speaker 5>they have some shoes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I know a underarmour has a show</v>

1340
01:01:02.571 --> 01:01:06.230
<v Speaker 5>called the speed freak that's um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>pretty flat.</v>

1341
01:01:06.760 --> 01:01:08.120
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a lot of these companies are</v>

1342
01:01:08.121 --> 01:01:11.660
<v Speaker 5>making flatter and flatter shoes now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but people like they sell good,</v>

1343
01:01:12.070 --> 01:01:13.430
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you see that big fat,</v>

1344
01:01:14.450 --> 01:01:15.640
<v Speaker 5>that big fat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He'll like go,</v>

1345
01:01:15.650 --> 01:01:16.850
<v Speaker 5>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look at all that cushioning.</v>

1346
01:01:16.880 --> 01:01:19.340
<v Speaker 5>They like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it sells good if was hard ones for</v>

1347
01:01:19.341 --> 01:01:21.740
<v Speaker 5>people that work out like it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a big crossfit shoe.</v>

1348
01:01:21.741 --> 01:01:23.690
<v Speaker 5>Like Nike's metcon three I think is what</v>
<v Speaker 5>it is.</v>

1349
01:01:23.691 --> 01:01:25.670
<v Speaker 5>It's got that hard plastic and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 5>talking about,</v>

1350
01:01:25.970 --> 01:01:27.620
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's for squats,</v>

1351
01:01:27.650 --> 01:01:29.840
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>They want you to have a heel for squat.</v>

1352
01:01:29.870 --> 01:01:31.800
<v Speaker 5>People do them and converse or barefoot</v>
<v Speaker 5>though.</v>

1353
01:01:31.930 --> 01:01:34.880
<v Speaker 5>They're just a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1354
01:01:34.881 --> 01:01:37.460
<v Speaker 5>I've heard,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know some people step on plates.</v>

1355
01:01:37.490 --> 01:01:40.400
<v Speaker 5>They'll put like a 10 pound plate on the</v>
<v Speaker 5>ground and they'll,</v>

1356
01:01:40.580 --> 01:01:44.720
<v Speaker 5>they'll put their heel on those plates</v>
<v Speaker 5>and they'll do squats that way I'm not,</v>

1357
01:01:44.780 --> 01:01:46.820
<v Speaker 5>I don't know who's right or who's wrong</v>
<v Speaker 5>when it comes to that.</v>

1358
01:01:46.821 --> 01:01:48.920
<v Speaker 5>I do everything barefoot,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all lifting,</v>

1359
01:01:49.220 --> 01:01:51.140
<v Speaker 5>all lifting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Either barefoot or with those little</v>

1360
01:01:51.141 --> 01:01:54.020
<v Speaker 5>five finger shoes on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So she was,</v>

1361
01:01:54.230 --> 01:01:56.210
<v Speaker 5>aren't you worried about getting</v>
<v Speaker 5>ringworm all over your feet?</v>

1362
01:01:56.840 --> 01:01:58.940
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why do you think you get ringworm?</v>

1363
01:01:59.510 --> 01:02:00.260
<v Speaker 5>Aren't gems.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1364
01:02:00.260 --> 01:02:01.610
<v Speaker 5>I guess you haven't yet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Private Gym,</v>

1365
01:02:01.850 --> 01:02:04.170
<v Speaker 5>like Jim said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're just like the dirty subsidiary.</v>

1366
01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:05.660
<v Speaker 5>But here's the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the thing,</v>

<v Speaker 5>athlete's foot at the same thing.</v>

1369

<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1371
01:02:13.580 --> 01:02:14.900
<v Speaker 5>exactly the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1372
01:02:15.350 --> 01:02:18.620
<v Speaker 5>It's just skin fungus.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The best way to prevent against skin</v>

1373
01:02:18.621 --> 01:02:23.490
<v Speaker 5>fungus have healthy skin flora.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So don't fuck with any antibacterial</v>

1374
01:02:23.491 --> 01:02:26.160
<v Speaker 5>soaps because when you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>unless you're a doctor obviously,</v>

1375
01:02:26.510 --> 01:02:29.340
<v Speaker 5>but when you're using antibacterial</v>
<v Speaker 5>soap,</v>

1376
01:02:29.460 --> 01:02:32.280
<v Speaker 5>soap on a regular basis,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're killing everything.</v>

1377
01:02:32.700 --> 01:02:37.530
<v Speaker 5>You're killing all the good bacteria to</v>
<v Speaker 5>which you want is soap that promotes</v>

1378
01:02:37.531 --> 01:02:39.660
<v Speaker 5>healthy skin floor,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like defense soap.</v>

1379
01:02:39.700 --> 01:02:44.250
<v Speaker 5>They make this soap with tea tree oil</v>
<v Speaker 5>and eucalyptus oil smells good.</v>

1380
01:02:44.730 --> 01:02:45.480
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it,</v>

1381
01:02:45.480 --> 01:02:47.400
<v Speaker 5>but it's really healthy for your skin.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not,</v>

1382
01:02:47.401 --> 01:02:49.140
<v Speaker 5>there's no chemicals,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's no bullshit.</v>

1383
01:02:49.141 --> 01:02:52.680
<v Speaker 5>It's just natural oils that promote</v>
<v Speaker 5>healthy bacteria and,</v>

1384
01:02:52.980 --> 01:02:56.130
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and they deny the growth of shitty</v>

1385
01:02:56.131 --> 01:02:58.620
<v Speaker 5>bacteria somehow or another.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean there's a lot of stuff like that</v>

1386
01:02:58.621 --> 01:03:01.680
<v Speaker 5>in nature that does teach.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Aerial is a big one for that.</v>

1387
01:03:02.070 --> 01:03:05.010
<v Speaker 5>Promotes healthy bacteria,</v>
<v Speaker 5>kills off all the bad shit.</v>

1388
01:03:05.600 --> 01:03:08.480
<v Speaker 1>I use it everyday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And how like just keeping everything</v>

1389
01:03:08.481 --> 01:03:09.410
<v Speaker 1>dry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1390
01:03:09.411 --> 01:03:11.450
<v Speaker 1>like that's good too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what if you live in the jungle</v>

1391
01:03:11.451 --> 01:03:14.810
<v Speaker 1>bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just make sure you're circumcise too.</v>

1392
01:03:15.140 --> 01:03:17.420
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's probably right.</v>

1393
01:03:17.660 --> 01:03:22.160
<v Speaker 1>Sweaty Dick in the jungle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of ringworm everywhere you're a,</v>

1394
01:03:22.340 --> 01:03:24.920
<v Speaker 5>your body has like a whole system,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1395
01:03:24.921 --> 01:03:28.400
<v Speaker 5>and that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that whole system is fortified by you</v>

1396
01:03:28.401 --> 01:03:33.080
<v Speaker 5>eating fermented foods and things that</v>
<v Speaker 5>are probiotic and yogurt and like,</v>

1397
01:03:33.140 --> 01:03:35.300
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is like strategies that people have</v>

1398
01:03:35.301 --> 01:03:39.710
<v Speaker 5>come up with over the years to introduce</v>
<v Speaker 5>probiotic foods into their diet.</v>

1399
01:03:39.711 --> 01:03:42.470
<v Speaker 5>And some of it was by accident by just</v>
<v Speaker 5>trying to preserve things and they</v>

1400
01:03:42.471 --> 01:03:44.630
<v Speaker 5>fermented and some of it was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1401
01:03:44.631 --> 01:03:45.800
<v Speaker 5>they figured out like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>

1402
01:03:45.801 --> 01:03:48.170
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we can do this it and I have a better</v>

1403
01:03:48.171 --> 01:03:49.004
<v Speaker 5>result with that.</v>

1404
01:03:49.690 --> 01:03:51.790
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

1405
01:03:51.880 --> 01:03:53.840
<v Speaker 1>that's really what's the</v>

1406
01:03:54.050 --> 01:03:56.300
<v Speaker 5>cause of a lot of skin issues.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1407
01:03:56.301 --> 01:03:59.960
<v Speaker 5>you're going to get ringworm anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you're exposed to it all the time and</v>

1408
01:03:59.961 --> 01:04:02.120
<v Speaker 5>you have open sores,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can't get to a shower in time.</v>

1409
01:04:02.121 --> 01:04:03.710
<v Speaker 5>It's totally likely that you could get</v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

1410
01:04:04.070 --> 01:04:07.920
<v Speaker 5>But I guarantee your recovery time and</v>
<v Speaker 5>the instances that you get,</v>

1411
01:04:07.921 --> 01:04:10.910
<v Speaker 5>it will be less likely if you take</v>
<v Speaker 5>acidophilus.</v>

1412
01:04:11.300 --> 01:04:12.410
<v Speaker 5>If you take a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a,</v>

1413
01:04:12.440 --> 01:04:14.830
<v Speaker 5>I like Kombucha.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a bunch of different probiotics</v>

1414
01:04:14.870 --> 01:04:15.703
<v Speaker 5>you can take</v>

1415
01:04:16.060 --> 01:04:20.080
<v Speaker 1>and it's just very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a very smart thing for your body.</v>

1416
01:04:21.070 --> 01:04:22.990
<v Speaker 1>But that's one of the one things about</v>
<v Speaker 1>diet coke.</v>

1417
01:04:23.170 --> 01:04:25.480
<v Speaker 1>I think diet coke all as delicious as it</v>
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

1418
01:04:25.960 --> 01:04:28.390
<v Speaker 1>Rex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're healthy skin flora within your</v>

1419
01:04:28.391 --> 01:04:29.300
<v Speaker 1>gut flora.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1420
01:04:29.350 --> 01:04:31.330
<v Speaker 1>it probably does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just read the other day,</v>

1421
01:04:31.331 --> 01:04:35.740
<v Speaker 1>like if you drink one diet coke a day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like something about Alzheimer's.</v>

1422
01:04:35.741 --> 01:04:38.350
<v Speaker 1>I think it is that where there's like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>direct connection to,</v>

1423
01:04:38.760 --> 01:04:39.880
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forget it.</v>

1424
01:04:39.881 --> 01:04:40.990
<v Speaker 1>Fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What it was,</v>

1425
01:04:41.020 --> 01:04:42.610
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty,</v>

1426
01:04:43.210 --> 01:04:44.800
<v Speaker 1>pretty scary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dot cooks so bad.</v>

1427
01:04:44.830 --> 01:04:47.230
<v Speaker 1>Took out Tammy Faye Bakker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1428
01:04:47.620 --> 01:04:48.431
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Took her out,</v>

1429
01:04:48.431 --> 01:04:49.264
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That coke.</v>

1430
01:04:50.230 --> 01:04:54.670
<v Speaker 1>That's what they say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just one can triple your risk of stroke.</v>

1431
01:04:54.970 --> 01:04:57.550
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Donald Trump drinks 12 a day.</v>

1432
01:04:57.920 --> 01:05:00.310
<v Speaker 1>Done mother fuckers invincible as I</v>
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

1433
01:05:00.311 --> 01:05:04.430
<v Speaker 1>cokes are probably better for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cuffs do Donald's story.</v>

1434
01:05:04.660 --> 01:05:05.830
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mysterious.</v>

1435
01:05:05.831 --> 01:05:08.830
<v Speaker 1>Loch ness type.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sea Creature washes ashore and Georgia</v>

1436
01:05:08.831 --> 01:05:09.220
<v Speaker 1>beach.</v>

1437
01:05:09.220 --> 01:05:10.540
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come on.</v>

1438
01:05:11.230 --> 01:05:13.840
<v Speaker 1>It is apparently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this just came out yesterday that,</v>

1439
01:05:13.841 --> 01:05:15.760
<v Speaker 1>but they still like marine wildlife</v>
<v Speaker 1>experts,</v>

1440
01:05:15.761 --> 01:05:18.430
<v Speaker 1>quote unquote don't know what it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the only picture of it.</v>

1441
01:05:18.460 --> 01:05:19.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's this video of it.</v>

1442
01:05:19.631 --> 01:05:21.070
<v Speaker 1>Let me see that again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wait,</v>

1443
01:05:21.071 --> 01:05:23.080
<v Speaker 1>how big is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's caught five feet long.</v>

1444
01:05:23.081 --> 01:05:26.010
<v Speaker 1>I think it's like a plesiosaur.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what they said.</v>

1445
01:05:26.040 --> 01:05:28.190
<v Speaker 1>They a certain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1446
01:05:28.360 --> 01:05:30.730
<v Speaker 1>sea mammals can decompose to look like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1447
01:05:30.950 --> 01:05:31.783
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one,</v>

1448
01:05:31.860 --> 01:05:34.370
<v Speaker 1>it just showed up on a beach here</v>
<v Speaker 1>showing that video again.</v>

1449
01:05:34.580 --> 01:05:35.351
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's the picture.</v>

1450
01:05:35.351 --> 01:05:37.270
<v Speaker 1>Get bigger with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I blurred out the part where it was like</v>

1451
01:05:37.271 --> 01:05:39.880
<v Speaker 1>a gut or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

1452
01:05:40.210 --> 01:05:43.360
<v Speaker 1>It looks like it's just a piece of</v>
<v Speaker 1>seaweed and it's like at one inch long</v>

1453
01:05:43.710 --> 01:05:45.160
<v Speaker 1>and it looks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's hilarious.</v>

1454
01:05:45.161 --> 01:05:47.140
<v Speaker 1>They blurt out the guts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to show you this dead</v>

1455
01:05:47.141 --> 01:05:48.460
<v Speaker 1>body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're blur out the gods.</v>

1456
01:05:48.640 --> 01:05:49.600
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go back to the picture.</v>

1457
01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:50.630
<v Speaker 1>Live video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1458
01:05:50.630 --> 01:05:51.100
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1459
01:05:51.100 --> 01:05:53.560
<v Speaker 1>Does somebody see it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um hmm.</v>

1460
01:05:53.690 --> 01:05:57.500
<v Speaker 2>The flippers are very unusual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like in that long ass neck.</v>

1461
01:05:57.770 --> 01:05:59.870
<v Speaker 2>That's a very weird animal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whatever that is,</v>

1462
01:06:00.500 --> 01:06:03.920
<v Speaker 2>that'd be fucking dope if they found</v>
<v Speaker 2>some new crazy looking in Georgia</v>

1463
01:06:04.040 --> 01:06:06.530
<v Speaker 2>dinosaur type fish right off the coast</v>
<v Speaker 2>of Georgia.</v>

1464
01:06:06.531 --> 01:06:08.510
<v Speaker 2>There's so much shit down there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1465
01:06:08.511 --> 01:06:13.010
<v Speaker 2>you think about how many different</v>
<v Speaker 2>animals and organisms they are,</v>

1466
01:06:13.060 --> 01:06:15.950
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>constantly finding on earth.</v>

1467
01:06:15.980 --> 01:06:16.950
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that,</v>

1468
01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.580
<v Speaker 2>that new crayfish that they found in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>ocean,</v>

1469
01:06:19.581 --> 01:06:21.400
<v Speaker 2>that's all female that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1470
01:06:21.530 --> 01:06:24.260
<v Speaker 2>reproduces by cloning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you heard about that one.</v>

1471
01:06:24.710 --> 01:06:26.150
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're finding these fucking things</v>

1472
01:06:26.151 --> 01:06:28.370
<v Speaker 2>constantly that's in fresh water and</v>
<v Speaker 2>wheat,</v>

1473
01:06:28.371 --> 01:06:31.460
<v Speaker 2>but we have a way better account and</v>
<v Speaker 2>understanding of what's going on in</v>

1474
01:06:31.461 --> 01:06:35.810
<v Speaker 2>freshwater and we do of the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's so much down there that we don't</v>

1475
01:06:35.811 --> 01:06:37.760
<v Speaker 2>know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's so many life forms down there</v>

1476
01:06:37.761 --> 01:06:38.590
<v Speaker 2>that we're not aware of.</v>

1477
01:06:38.590 --> 01:06:40.690
<v Speaker 1>Do you know how much of the ocean floor</v>
<v Speaker 1>has been,</v>

1478
01:06:40.770 --> 01:06:44.560
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking less than 10% and 5% and why we</v>

1479
01:06:44.561 --> 01:06:46.240
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand why we're so</v>

1480
01:06:46.241 --> 01:06:49.570
<v Speaker 1>concerned about going to a different</v>
<v Speaker 1>planet when we haven't even figured out</v>

1481
01:06:49.571 --> 01:06:51.400
<v Speaker 1>this planet yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's ridiculous.</v>

1482
01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:55.030
<v Speaker 1>Then when James Cameron went and as his</v>
<v Speaker 1>movie the movie,</v>

1483
01:06:55.031 --> 01:06:57.520
<v Speaker 1>he made it to go as far down as anybody</v>
<v Speaker 1>has gone.</v>

1484
01:06:57.580 --> 01:07:01.930
<v Speaker 1>I was looking into this the other day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't break the record in 1962 guys</v>

1485
01:07:01.931 --> 01:07:05.530
<v Speaker 1>got into a submarine and went lower than</v>
<v Speaker 1>he did by like a hundred meters or some</v>

1486
01:07:05.531 --> 01:07:06.400
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

1487
01:07:06.460 --> 01:07:09.280
<v Speaker 1>wait 29,000 feet or something down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus,</v>

1488
01:07:09.580 --> 01:07:13.120
<v Speaker 1>and it's still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's still more and I think they just</v>

1489
01:07:13.121 --> 01:07:16.200
<v Speaker 1>discovered an area near where they were</v>
<v Speaker 1>going that's lower than what they</v>

1490
01:07:16.220 --> 01:07:18.430
<v Speaker 1>thought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The deepest part of the ocean was.</v>

1491
01:07:18.431 --> 01:07:22.240
<v Speaker 1>Top there for a second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>29,000 feet under the ground isn't a</v>

1492
01:07:22.241 --> 01:07:22.720
<v Speaker 1>mile.</v>

1493
01:07:22.720 --> 01:07:26.440
<v Speaker 1>5,000 feet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what?</v>

1494
01:07:27.970 --> 01:07:32.350
<v Speaker 1>What are you serious like they're almost</v>
<v Speaker 1>six miles down.</v>

1495
01:07:32.380 --> 01:07:37.380
<v Speaker 1>35,797 feet is the actual record.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What in the fuck ban?</v>

1496
01:07:39.400 --> 01:07:42.580
<v Speaker 1>That's seven miles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that real?</v>

1497
01:07:42.690 --> 01:07:44.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think a seven miles.</v>

1498
01:07:44.401 --> 01:07:49.401
<v Speaker 1>Seven miles is like here to studio city.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thing that they did under water,</v>

1499
01:07:51.970 --> 01:07:54.580
<v Speaker 1>how far can you see?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't see seven miles,</v>

1500
01:07:54.581 --> 01:07:55.330
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1501
01:07:55.330 --> 01:07:57.130
<v Speaker 1>Like the distance of the curve of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>earth.</v>

1502
01:07:57.290 --> 01:08:00.000
<v Speaker 1>The curve of the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you gotta find the flat too.</v>

1503
01:08:00.160 --> 01:08:01.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you're flat,</v>

1504
01:08:01.270 --> 01:08:03.880
<v Speaker 1>if you're on like a c level and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking straight,</v>

1505
01:08:03.881 --> 01:08:07.750
<v Speaker 1>how far can you see on a clear day?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you could probably see seven or</v>

1506
01:08:07.751 --> 01:08:08.620
<v Speaker 1>eight mile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably farther.</v>

1507
01:08:08.960 --> 01:08:11.410
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's nuts man.</v>

1508
01:08:11.411 --> 01:08:13.000
<v Speaker 1>It's seven miles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is this the guy?</v>

1509
01:08:13.240 --> 01:08:14.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's two guys actually,</v>

1510
01:08:14.261 --> 01:08:15.890
<v Speaker 1>they're still alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1511
01:08:15.891 --> 01:08:16.520
<v Speaker 1>Don Lawson,</v>

1512
01:08:16.520 --> 01:08:19.550
<v Speaker 2>jock picard shot and I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bet you never recover from something</v>

1513
01:08:19.551 --> 01:08:21.470
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You go all the way down there and you're</v>

1514
01:08:21.471 --> 01:08:22.490
<v Speaker 2>just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what in the fuck?</v>

1515
01:08:22.910 --> 01:08:25.730
<v Speaker 2>Fuck what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck are DNA probably changes</v>

1516
01:08:25.731 --> 01:08:28.640
<v Speaker 2>like that astronaut guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1517
01:08:28.660 --> 01:08:31.740
<v Speaker 2>Some day explained that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that was exaggerated,</v>

1518
01:08:32.120 --> 01:08:33.680
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that people were,</v>

1519
01:08:33.681 --> 01:08:38.681
<v Speaker 2>I'm oversimplifying simplifying the</v>
<v Speaker 2>situation to say that there is DNA</v>

1520
01:08:39.051 --> 01:08:43.940
<v Speaker 2>didn't change the way you think it did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's probably just like one molecule off</v>

1521
01:08:43.941 --> 01:08:45.680
<v Speaker 2>or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's probably not that big of a deal.</v>

1522
01:08:46.190 --> 01:08:48.020
<v Speaker 2>It's probably off though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1523
01:08:48.021 --> 01:08:48.441
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

1524
01:08:48.441 --> 01:08:51.010
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are they saying caused him see,</v>

1525
01:08:51.320 --> 01:08:54.560
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Google astronauts.</v>

1526
01:08:54.590 --> 01:08:56.660
<v Speaker 2>DNA didn't change the way you think it</v>
<v Speaker 2>did.</v>

1527
01:08:58.370 --> 01:08:59.300
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1528
01:09:00.590 --> 01:09:02.840
<v Speaker 2>we just don't understand like how it</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1529
01:09:03.230 --> 01:09:06.260
<v Speaker 2>no Scott Kelly's DNA did not change in</v>
<v Speaker 2>space.</v>

1530
01:09:06.261 --> 01:09:11.261
<v Speaker 2>And this is from wastes.com the way it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>a weight local news station o w a t</v>

1531
01:09:13.101 --> 01:09:15.380
<v Speaker 2>e.com is probably just an AP story that</v>
<v Speaker 2>had put up.</v>

1532
01:09:15.410 --> 01:09:16.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it exactly is.</v>

1533
01:09:16.761 --> 01:09:19.610
<v Speaker 2>Cause I know I saw it on something else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get it a little beer so I can read it</v>

1534
01:09:19.611 --> 01:09:20.930
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1535
01:09:20.960 --> 01:09:22.610
<v Speaker 2>after the Internet was abuzz about</v>
<v Speaker 2>astronauts,</v>

1536
01:09:22.611 --> 01:09:25.430
<v Speaker 2>Scott Kelly's purported altered DNA</v>
<v Speaker 2>after his year in space,</v>

1537
01:09:25.431 --> 01:09:27.680
<v Speaker 2>NASA is clarified the findings in their</v>
<v Speaker 2>study.</v>

1538
01:09:27.860 --> 01:09:32.480
<v Speaker 2>His DNA did not change by 7%.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's still an identical twin to his</v>

1539
01:09:32.481 --> 01:09:33.021
<v Speaker 2>brother.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mark.</v>

1540
01:09:33.021 --> 01:09:37.940
<v Speaker 2>I want my money back from all those</v>
<v Speaker 2>things I clicked you fuckhead NASA says</v>

1541
01:09:37.941 --> 01:09:42.941
<v Speaker 2>University of Tennessee's graduate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gene's expression changed by about 7%</v>

1542
01:09:43.491 --> 01:09:47.840
<v Speaker 2>gene expression is how your body reacts</v>
<v Speaker 2>to your environment and stress</v>

1543
01:09:47.841 --> 01:09:49.250
<v Speaker 2>fractures,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fractures.</v>

1544
01:09:49.580 --> 01:09:54.580
<v Speaker 2>They said this level of change in gene</v>
<v Speaker 2>expression was within the expected range</v>

1545
01:09:54.591 --> 01:09:58.830
<v Speaker 2>for humans in stressful environments</v>
<v Speaker 2>like scuba diving or Mountain Climb,</v>

1546
01:09:58.831 --> 01:10:00.440
<v Speaker 2>ag biome,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you fucks.</v>

1547
01:10:00.680 --> 01:10:04.100
<v Speaker 2>So every time you go mountain climbing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not an identical twin to your</v>

1548
01:10:04.101 --> 01:10:06.620
<v Speaker 2>brother anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're assholes.</v>

1549
01:10:06.621 --> 01:10:08.060
<v Speaker 2>We're just lying to ourselves.</v>

1550
01:10:08.330 --> 01:10:11.060
<v Speaker 2>We just lie to ourselves for clicks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm Matt,</v>

1551
01:10:12.440 --> 01:10:13.820
<v Speaker 2>I'm Ha,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had enough.</v>

1552
01:10:14.030 --> 01:10:18.080
<v Speaker 2>It's like these people need to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>punished for their clickbait.</v>

1553
01:10:18.260 --> 01:10:20.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're doing it on purpose at its worst</v>

1554
01:10:20.961 --> 01:10:23.570
<v Speaker 2>on like youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you could put up a little</v>

1555
01:10:23.571 --> 01:10:27.710
<v Speaker 2>thumbnail and get people clicking on</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff and make thousands of dollars just</v>

1556
01:10:27.711 --> 01:10:28.670
<v Speaker 2>for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>

1557
01:10:29.360 --> 01:10:33.440
<v Speaker 2>I went deep on youtube the other day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever watched somebody die from</v>

1558
01:10:33.441 --> 01:10:35.090
<v Speaker 2>rabies?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh No.</v>

1559
01:10:35.210 --> 01:10:37.940
<v Speaker 2>There's videos of people dying from</v>
<v Speaker 2>rabies on Youtube.</v>

1560
01:10:37.941 --> 01:10:41.690
<v Speaker 2>It's the most fascinating thing ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

1561
01:10:41.691 --> 01:10:43.520
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know people still died from</v>
<v Speaker 2>rabies,</v>

1562
01:10:43.521 --> 01:10:46.550
<v Speaker 2>but there's like people that have rabies</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if you watch it's haunting,</v>

1563
01:10:46.700 --> 01:10:49.370
<v Speaker 2>you pretty much are going crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why don't they just kill them?</v>

1564
01:10:49.720 --> 01:10:51.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they know why.</v>

1565
01:10:51.450 --> 01:10:55.400
<v Speaker 2>Why do we need people to die 100%</v>
<v Speaker 2>naturally?</v>

1566
01:10:55.840 --> 01:10:57.410
<v Speaker 2>Like what is that about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like look at,</v>

1567
01:10:57.420 --> 01:10:59.870
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so interesting to watch these</v>

1568
01:10:59.871 --> 01:11:01.970
<v Speaker 2>videos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1569
01:11:02.020 --> 01:11:05.930
<v Speaker 2>What year is this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Seems like an old fifties sixties or</v>

1570
01:11:05.931 --> 01:11:08.570
<v Speaker 2>something like that and you just die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rabies,</v>

1571
01:11:08.571 --> 01:11:10.220
<v Speaker 2>you don't bounce back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right and right.</v>

1572
01:11:10.280 --> 01:11:13.800
<v Speaker 2>And it's very sad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't hold water in</v>

1573
01:11:13.980 --> 01:11:16.650
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you just constantly spit out water.</v>

1574
01:11:19.280 --> 01:11:20.480
<v Speaker 5>Oh Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>dude.</v>

1575
01:11:20.900 --> 01:11:23.450
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is scary stuff,</v>

1576
01:11:23.451 --> 01:11:24.284
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's trying to eat.</v>

1577
01:11:24.290 --> 01:11:25.620
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it does.</v>

1578
01:11:25.650 --> 01:11:27.640
<v Speaker 5>It won't work.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He just puts it in his mouth and it will</v>

1579
01:11:27.641 --> 01:11:28.760
<v Speaker 5>spit it out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Probably.</v>

1580
01:11:29.780 --> 01:11:31.460
<v Speaker 5>What a fucked up disease,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

1581
01:11:31.670 --> 01:11:36.670
<v Speaker 5>Rabies is so crazy because it really is</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a Zombie disease for dogs,</v>

1582
01:11:37.580 --> 01:11:38.270
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1583
01:11:38.270 --> 01:11:40.100
<v Speaker 5>For dogs or animals,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they get it.</v>

1584
01:11:40.101 --> 01:11:40.911
<v Speaker 5>They,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh my God,</v>

1585
01:11:40.911 --> 01:11:43.040
<v Speaker 5>look at me foaming at the mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1586
01:11:43.190 --> 01:11:46.340
<v Speaker 5>Now let me ask you this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>At what point in time to just give this</v>

1587
01:11:46.341 --> 01:11:48.920
<v Speaker 5>guy a lethal dose of morphine and get</v>
<v Speaker 5>this over with right now?</v>

1588
01:11:49.520 --> 01:11:51.470
<v Speaker 5>Like why did they let him get this far</v>
<v Speaker 5>gone?</v>

1589
01:11:51.560 --> 01:11:52.970
<v Speaker 5>They're just letting them die on his</v>
<v Speaker 5>own.</v>

1590
01:11:53.390 --> 01:11:56.030
<v Speaker 5>What is it about people that want people</v>
<v Speaker 5>to die on their own?</v>

1591
01:11:56.220 --> 01:11:58.430
<v Speaker 5>Like there's a certain amount we know</v>
<v Speaker 5>about the human body,</v>

1592
01:11:58.700 --> 01:12:00.680
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>When he gets to that sort of a stage.</v>

1593
01:12:02.210 --> 01:12:02.961
<v Speaker 5>Got It.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1594
01:12:02.961 --> 01:12:07.010
<v Speaker 5>the guy's foaming at the mouth,</v>
<v Speaker 5>twitching and bucking while he's</v>

1595
01:12:07.190 --> 01:12:07.780
<v Speaker 5>strapped to it.</v>

1596
01:12:07.780 --> 01:12:08.620
<v Speaker 3>Bed at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And.</v>

1597
01:12:08.621 --> 01:12:10.000
<v Speaker 3>T.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's videos of kids.</v>

1598
01:12:10.070 --> 01:12:12.930
<v Speaker 3>It's just like little like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like three year old kids having rabies</v>

1599
01:12:12.960 --> 01:12:14.800
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you can't do anything.</v>

1600
01:12:14.801 --> 01:12:16.510
<v Speaker 3>Just have to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they should kill her.</v>

1601
01:12:16.810 --> 01:12:18.820
<v Speaker 3>But like it's in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they do now.</v>

1602
01:12:19.300 --> 01:12:22.210
<v Speaker 3>I think they just let him today suffer</v>
<v Speaker 3>today.</v>

1603
01:12:22.211 --> 01:12:23.920
<v Speaker 3>I don't think you're allowed to kill</v>
<v Speaker 3>anybody,</v>

1604
01:12:23.921 --> 01:12:24.670
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1605
01:12:24.670 --> 01:12:27.160
<v Speaker 3>I mean I saw him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean if you have rabies,</v>

1606
01:12:27.161 --> 01:12:29.050
<v Speaker 3>do they have a cure?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think like,</v>

1607
01:12:29.110 --> 01:12:31.750
<v Speaker 3>like if as an example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you get bit by a raccoon,</v>

1608
01:12:31.751 --> 01:12:34.180
<v Speaker 3>you'd have to go through all those like</v>
<v Speaker 3>a hundred shots.</v>

1609
01:12:34.200 --> 01:12:34.841
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1610
01:12:34.841 --> 01:12:39.070
<v Speaker 3>type thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how long you have til to do</v>

1611
01:12:39.071 --> 01:12:39.904
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1612
01:12:40.260 --> 01:12:45.260
<v Speaker 5>Anybody that thinks that all</v>
<v Speaker 5>vaccinations are bad is a fucking idiot.</v>

1613
01:12:48.300 --> 01:12:53.300
<v Speaker 5>If you really think that it's all some</v>
<v Speaker 5>sort of a big giant conspiracy to ruin</v>

1614
01:12:53.431 --> 01:12:55.680
<v Speaker 5>people and make a ton of money,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're crazy.</v>

1615
01:12:56.250 --> 01:12:58.590
<v Speaker 5>If people getting jacked by</v>
<v Speaker 5>vaccinations,</v>

1616
01:12:58.591 --> 01:13:03.570
<v Speaker 5>that is an unfortunate side effect of</v>
<v Speaker 5>one of the most spectacular things that</v>

1617
01:13:03.571 --> 01:13:06.780
<v Speaker 5>human beings have ever created.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They created a way to combat diseases</v>

1618
01:13:06.781 --> 01:13:11.781
<v Speaker 5>that killed untold millions.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let me think about the fuck of malaria</v>

1619
01:13:13.200 --> 01:13:16.200
<v Speaker 5>vaccinations.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They can give you malaria shots,</v>

1620
01:13:16.400 --> 01:13:19.290
<v Speaker 5>a bunch of different shit they give you</v>
<v Speaker 5>or malaria pills.</v>

1621
01:13:19.291 --> 01:13:23.340
<v Speaker 5>You take pills and then you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you go over there and you live where</v>

1622
01:13:23.341 --> 01:13:24.810
<v Speaker 5>malaria kills everybody.</v>

1623
01:13:26.590 --> 01:13:27.520
<v Speaker 5>Polio.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1624
01:13:27.521 --> 01:13:29.590
<v Speaker 5>they basically wiped out polio.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It did.</v>

1625
01:13:29.591 --> 01:13:32.140
<v Speaker 5>It just recently come back.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just because people aren't vaccinating</v>

1626
01:13:32.141 --> 01:13:33.060
<v Speaker 5>the kids anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1627
01:13:33.640 --> 01:13:35.220
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of people that aren't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1628
01:13:36.190 --> 01:13:37.960
<v Speaker 5>mumps,</v>
<v Speaker 5>measles.</v>

1629
01:13:37.990 --> 01:13:40.360
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of different ones.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're making their way back.</v>

1630
01:13:41.260 --> 01:13:42.670
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Mean they figured out,</v>

1631
01:13:42.700 --> 01:13:43.990
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not perfect,</v>

1632
01:13:44.110 --> 01:13:47.800
<v Speaker 5>but there's not a damn thing that</v>
<v Speaker 5>involves putting chemicals in your body.</v>

1633
01:13:47.801 --> 01:13:49.270
<v Speaker 5>That's perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not a damn thing.</v>

1634
01:13:49.990 --> 01:13:53.800
<v Speaker 5>But what they've done with vaccinations</v>
<v Speaker 5>is fucking amazing.</v>

1635
01:13:54.280 --> 01:13:56.770
<v Speaker 5>Now I think I agree with you on flu</v>
<v Speaker 5>shots.</v>

1636
01:13:56.950 --> 01:13:58.610
<v Speaker 5>I don't get flu shots.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1637
01:13:59.220 --> 01:14:00.460
<v Speaker 5>I never had one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>

1638
01:14:00.520 --> 01:14:03.910
<v Speaker 5>I don't think that they don't work.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think they work sometimes,</v>

1639
01:14:04.390 --> 01:14:06.790
<v Speaker 5>but I know people that have taken flu</v>
<v Speaker 5>shots and gotten sick.</v>

1640
01:14:06.830 --> 01:14:07.231
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1641
01:14:07.231 --> 01:14:09.060
<v Speaker 3>Cause it's the flu and you're not</v>
<v Speaker 3>supposed to.</v>

1642
01:14:09.061 --> 01:14:12.040
<v Speaker 3>But I usually for a couple of days you</v>
<v Speaker 3>might a little sick.</v>

1643
01:14:12.180 --> 01:14:13.630
<v Speaker 5>He wants that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What does this,</v>

1644
01:14:13.730 --> 01:14:15.670
<v Speaker 5>it's the disease express itself in two</v>
<v Speaker 5>forms.</v>

1645
01:14:15.671 --> 01:14:17.240
<v Speaker 5>Furious rabies,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whoa.</v>

1646
01:14:17.620 --> 01:14:21.010
<v Speaker 5>70% of human cases cause hyper excited</v>
<v Speaker 5>behavior,</v>

1647
01:14:21.011 --> 01:14:24.700
<v Speaker 5>a strong fear of water and sometimes a</v>
<v Speaker 5>strong fear of flying.</v>

1648
01:14:25.170 --> 01:14:29.020
<v Speaker 5>This will eventually result in death by</v>
<v Speaker 5>cardio respiratory arrest,</v>

1649
01:14:29.860 --> 01:14:34.240
<v Speaker 5>paralytic rabies.</v>
<v Speaker 5>30% is a less exciting and takes longer</v>

1650
01:14:34.241 --> 01:14:37.240
<v Speaker 5>to kill you with it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Your muscles gradually paralyzed</v>

1651
01:14:37.241 --> 01:14:39.820
<v Speaker 5>beginning at the source of the infection</v>
<v Speaker 5>spreading outwards.</v>

1652
01:14:39.821 --> 01:14:42.220
<v Speaker 5>What is this article from everything you</v>
<v Speaker 5>want to talk about?</v>

1653
01:14:42.221 --> 01:14:43.450
<v Speaker 5>Rabies cause that Gizmodo.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1654
01:14:44.770 --> 01:14:47.500
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>With extreme aggression that most</v>

1655
01:14:47.501 --> 01:14:50.560
<v Speaker 5>strongly characterize the disease when</v>
<v Speaker 5>the animals have it.</v>

1656
01:14:50.561 --> 01:14:52.990
<v Speaker 5>What's fascinating to me is that they</v>
<v Speaker 5>want to bite you,</v>

1657
01:14:53.890 --> 01:14:57.940
<v Speaker 5>so which would help spread the disease.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's almost like the disease uses the</v>

1658
01:14:57.941 --> 01:15:01.750
<v Speaker 5>animal system.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It makes the the animal more likely to</v>

1659
01:15:01.751 --> 01:15:04.570
<v Speaker 5>bite.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like it's like piloting the animal and</v>

1660
01:15:04.571 --> 01:15:06.550
<v Speaker 5>getting it to attack Zombie.</v>

1661
01:15:06.670 --> 01:15:09.460
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Have you ever seen the the rat with</v>

1662
01:15:09.461 --> 01:15:13.280
<v Speaker 5>rabies chasing the cat?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean think we've talked about stop</v>

1663
01:15:13.300 --> 01:15:15.640
<v Speaker 5>rabies.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The Rad has toxoplasma.</v>

1664
01:15:16.060 --> 01:15:17.920
<v Speaker 5>It's a different thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a different parasite.</v>

1665
01:15:18.040 --> 01:15:20.950
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the thing that's super common</v>

1666
01:15:20.951 --> 01:15:25.900
<v Speaker 5>with cats and rats and people get it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And somewhere around 50 million</v>

1667
01:15:25.901 --> 01:15:28.250
<v Speaker 5>Americans have,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it affects your judgment,</v>

1668
01:15:28.570 --> 01:15:31.150
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>makes you more impulsive in it.</v>

1669
01:15:31.151 --> 01:15:34.510
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a direct relationship to people</v>

1670
01:15:34.511 --> 01:15:38.500
<v Speaker 5>or toxoplasma infected and motorcycle</v>
<v Speaker 5>accidents.</v>

1671
01:15:39.250 --> 01:15:40.990
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're more likely to get in motorcycle</v>

1672
01:15:40.991 --> 01:15:42.990
<v Speaker 5>accidents.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Robert Sapolsky talked about,</v>

1673
01:15:43.010 --> 01:15:44.230
<v Speaker 5>he was on a podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We did.</v>

1674
01:15:44.590 --> 01:15:46.420
<v Speaker 5>It's one of my favorite ones,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it was really quick.</v>

1675
01:15:46.421 --> 01:15:48.340
<v Speaker 5>It was only looking at it for us.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was like an hour.</v>

1676
01:15:49.330 --> 01:15:51.040
<v Speaker 5>And so Paul ski is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1677
01:15:51.100 --> 01:15:56.100
<v Speaker 5>just world renowned for his study of</v>
<v Speaker 5>toxo plasma and what it does to people,</v>

1678
01:15:56.950 --> 01:15:59.080
<v Speaker 5>but it affects the cats.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1679
01:15:59.410 --> 01:16:01.210
<v Speaker 5>well first of all affects the rats.</v>

1680
01:16:01.240 --> 01:16:04.540
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sexual reward system hijacks his brain,</v>

1681
01:16:04.570 --> 01:16:08.350
<v Speaker 5>gives it a boner to get erect at the</v>
<v Speaker 5>smell of cat urine sometimes.</v>

1682
01:16:08.680 --> 01:16:10.590
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it takes away their fear of cats</v>

1683
01:16:10.610 --> 01:16:12.680
<v Speaker 5>completely.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So they go wander around cat.</v>

1684
01:16:12.681 --> 01:16:16.990
<v Speaker 5>The cats kill them and then they get</v>
<v Speaker 5>into the cat that way because they can</v>

1685
01:16:16.991 --> 01:16:19.270
<v Speaker 5>only reproduce inside the cat's</v>
<v Speaker 5>digestive system.</v>

1686
01:16:19.600 --> 01:16:23.050
<v Speaker 5>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So these worms get into the cat's body.</v>

1687
01:16:23.051 --> 01:16:25.810
<v Speaker 5>So they can reproduce and then they shit</v>
<v Speaker 5>out.</v>

1688
01:16:25.811 --> 01:16:27.880
<v Speaker 5>Catch it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People come in contact with the cat</v>

1689
01:16:27.881 --> 01:16:29.800
<v Speaker 5>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes even through their feet,</v>

1690
01:16:30.070 --> 01:16:32.020
<v Speaker 5>through walking around barefoot around</v>
<v Speaker 5>cat shit.</v>

1691
01:16:32.260 --> 01:16:35.750
<v Speaker 5>The toxo gets in their system and it</v>
<v Speaker 5>affects the way they behave.</v>

1692
01:16:36.400 --> 01:16:39.970
<v Speaker 5>Some crazy amount of people in the world</v>
<v Speaker 5>habit like at one point in time at</v>

1693
01:16:39.971 --> 01:16:43.330
<v Speaker 5>France it was more than 40% of the</v>
<v Speaker 5>people had it.</v>

1694
01:16:43.720 --> 01:16:44.830
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's nuts.</v>

1695
01:16:45.490 --> 01:16:47.110
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what's doing it to that cat.</v>

1696
01:16:47.740 --> 01:16:49.450
<v Speaker 5>That was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a lot of those things,</v>

1697
01:16:49.451 --> 01:16:51.490
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How about that aquatic worm that makes</v>

1698
01:16:51.730 --> 01:16:55.960
<v Speaker 5>grasshoppers drown themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 5>grows inside a bug's body and then says,</v>

1699
01:16:55.961 --> 01:16:57.610
<v Speaker 5>hey faggot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Once you go jump in that water,</v>

1700
01:16:58.720 --> 01:17:02.250
<v Speaker 5>I will jump in that water and they</v>
<v Speaker 5>jumped in the water and they drown.</v>

1701
01:17:02.300 --> 01:17:03.890
<v Speaker 5>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's crazy.</v>

1702
01:17:03.891 --> 01:17:08.230
<v Speaker 5>They talk this organism and it killing</v>
<v Speaker 5>itself so that they can pop out in the</v>

1703
01:17:08.231 --> 01:17:09.100
<v Speaker 5>water and live.</v>

1704
01:17:11.240 --> 01:17:12.950
<v Speaker 5>There's a bunch of things like that in</v>
<v Speaker 5>nature.</v>

1705
01:17:13.130 --> 01:17:14.690
<v Speaker 5>We,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have to wonder like how,</v>

1706
01:17:14.840 --> 01:17:17.840
<v Speaker 5>how did this evolve?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like what kind of,</v>

1707
01:17:17.990 --> 01:17:21.980
<v Speaker 5>what is what's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like what is the actual process that</v>

1708
01:17:21.981 --> 01:17:26.300
<v Speaker 5>allows something to evolve into a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a plant that can eat a rat.</v>

1709
01:17:26.710 --> 01:17:30.200
<v Speaker 5>You ever see that plant that gets her</v>
<v Speaker 5>all slippery and smells good?</v>

1710
01:17:30.201 --> 01:17:33.830
<v Speaker 5>So the rats come here and they fall into</v>
<v Speaker 5>the hole and it's into this like this</v>

1711
01:17:33.831 --> 01:17:37.700
<v Speaker 5>looks like a like a two lip,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a giant thick two lip and it just</v>

1712
01:17:37.701 --> 01:17:40.670
<v Speaker 5>absorbs the rat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like how the fuck did that start?</v>

1713
01:17:41.070 --> 01:17:43.010
<v Speaker 5>And that's what it does all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I get tricks,</v>

1714
01:17:43.011 --> 01:17:45.640
<v Speaker 5>the rats like what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like what,</v>

1715
01:17:45.641 --> 01:17:48.140
<v Speaker 5>what was stage one?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like what was that thing like in the</v>

1716
01:17:48.141 --> 01:17:49.460
<v Speaker 5>beginning?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What did it like?</v>

1717
01:17:49.750 --> 01:17:52.220
<v Speaker 5>He did it a catch a bug and the bugs are</v>
<v Speaker 5>cool,</v>

1718
01:17:52.400 --> 01:17:54.980
<v Speaker 5>but let's get one of the furry fuckers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's always chewing on my leaves,</v>

1719
01:17:55.810 --> 01:17:59.920
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>does just so many different forms of</v>

1720
01:17:59.921 --> 01:18:02.440
<v Speaker 5>life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And this is all we know about earth.</v>

1721
01:18:02.980 --> 01:18:05.530
<v Speaker 5>Like we were talking about exploring the</v>
<v Speaker 5>ocean.</v>

1722
01:18:05.990 --> 01:18:10.990
<v Speaker 5>You imagine if we found some crazy</v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking half human looking things that</v>

1723
01:18:11.771 --> 01:18:12.390
<v Speaker 5>live on it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I think that,</v>

1724
01:18:12.390 --> 01:18:14.670
<v Speaker 6>I told you about this before,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but there's this plant,</v>

1725
01:18:14.780 --> 01:18:16.800
<v Speaker 6>it's on planet earth two,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so I'm not really going to show the</v>

1726
01:18:16.801 --> 01:18:19.490
<v Speaker 6>footage,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it has these seedlings on this</v>

1727
01:18:19.491 --> 01:18:23.520
<v Speaker 6>specific island somewhere that these</v>
<v Speaker 6>birds come and land and they eat the</v>

1728
01:18:23.521 --> 01:18:24.960
<v Speaker 6>seeds,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and then they also,</v>

1729
01:18:24.961 --> 01:18:27.330
<v Speaker 6>if they get stuck to the bird's bodies</v>
<v Speaker 6>and as they fly around,</v>

1730
01:18:27.331 --> 01:18:31.170
<v Speaker 6>that's how it spreads.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But the birds can get them stuck to them</v>

1731
01:18:31.230 --> 01:18:36.230
<v Speaker 6>so much that it gets stuck on the ground</v>
<v Speaker 6>and they can't fly anymore and they end</v>

1732
01:18:36.601 --> 01:18:41.601
<v Speaker 6>up dying and then being decomposed and</v>
<v Speaker 6>the plants sort of like he throws out of</v>

1733
01:18:41.641 --> 01:18:42.630
<v Speaker 6>them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1734
01:18:42.730 --> 01:18:43.870
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're covered in these things,</v>

1735
01:18:43.871 --> 01:18:45.970
<v Speaker 5>like the birds trying to clean the</v>
<v Speaker 5>things off him.</v>

1736
01:18:46.210 --> 01:18:47.650
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The birds eat them.</v>

1737
01:18:47.710 --> 01:18:49.030
<v Speaker 5>Oh look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's decomposing.</v>

1738
01:18:49.031 --> 01:18:50.830
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and the trees growing out of them.</v>

1739
01:18:50.860 --> 01:18:52.360
<v Speaker 5>Fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's crazy.</v>

1740
01:18:52.570 --> 01:18:55.480
<v Speaker 5>That's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The planner to stuff is awesome.</v>

1741
01:18:55.510 --> 01:18:57.550
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Planet Earth and planet earth two are</v>

1742
01:18:57.610 --> 01:18:59.470
<v Speaker 5>both amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1743
01:18:59.560 --> 01:19:02.770
<v Speaker 5>I mean when you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you see the very bizarre ways that</v>

1744
01:19:02.771 --> 01:19:06.610
<v Speaker 5>nature figures out how to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how to take advantage of a situation.</v>

1745
01:19:06.970 --> 01:19:09.760
<v Speaker 5>My favorite one is that cordyceps</v>
<v Speaker 5>mushroom that grows in those,</v>

1746
01:19:10.120 --> 01:19:14.300
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>those ants and the other ants recognize</v>

1747
01:19:14.301 --> 01:19:17.380
<v Speaker 5>that this is a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that this thing died with these ants.</v>

1748
01:19:17.950 --> 01:19:20.650
<v Speaker 5>These ants died with these mushrooms</v>
<v Speaker 5>growing inside of it.</v>

1749
01:19:20.860 --> 01:19:25.860
<v Speaker 5>And the spores will build up inside this</v>
<v Speaker 5>thing's body and then explode and spray</v>

1750
01:19:26.081 --> 01:19:27.760
<v Speaker 5>through the air.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And in fact,</v>

1751
01:19:27.790 --> 01:19:30.370
<v Speaker 5>all the other ants around it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like literally,</v>

1752
01:19:30.371 --> 01:19:31.570
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like a bomb.</v>

1753
01:19:31.930 --> 01:19:33.850
<v Speaker 5>And somehow or another,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the ants know this.</v>

1754
01:19:34.150 --> 01:19:37.840
<v Speaker 5>So the ants take the body and they drag</v>
<v Speaker 5>it out of town.</v>

1755
01:19:38.080 --> 01:19:39.550
<v Speaker 5>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we gotta get 'em out of here before the</v>

1756
01:19:39.580 --> 01:19:40.840
<v Speaker 5>poor blows.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1757
01:19:40.841 --> 01:19:43.720
<v Speaker 5>it's literally like someone throws the</v>
<v Speaker 5>hangry and your car,</v>

1758
01:19:43.721 --> 01:19:47.050
<v Speaker 5>you just chuck it out just in time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's fucking nuts,</v>

1759
01:19:47.051 --> 01:19:47.884
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

1760
01:19:49.230 --> 01:19:51.390
<v Speaker 5>I love shit like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's fucking nuts.</v>

1761
01:19:52.070 --> 01:19:53.220
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's fucking nuts.</v>

1762
01:19:53.280 --> 01:19:54.180
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it really is.</v>

1763
01:19:55.680 --> 01:19:56.760
<v Speaker 5>How does it know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1764
01:19:56.761 --> 01:20:00.060
<v Speaker 5>how these Goddamn ants know that they</v>
<v Speaker 5>have to get this thing out of there so</v>

1765
01:20:00.061 --> 01:20:01.410
<v Speaker 5>the thing's dead.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1766
01:20:01.740 --> 01:20:04.200
<v Speaker 5>And then little spores start growing out</v>
<v Speaker 5>of its head.</v>

1767
01:20:04.230 --> 01:20:06.750
<v Speaker 5>See the spore grown out of its head.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is crazy.</v>

1768
01:20:06.780 --> 01:20:07.790
<v Speaker 5>That's nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1769
01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:10.800
<v Speaker 2>So the mushrooms grow inside their</v>
<v Speaker 2>bodies,</v>

1770
01:20:11.340 --> 01:20:15.840
<v Speaker 2>and I don't know how the ants know this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the ants know they got to get that</v>

1771
01:20:15.841 --> 01:20:18.840
<v Speaker 2>fucking thing out of town.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1772
01:20:18.990 --> 01:20:22.890
<v Speaker 2>And they drag him away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's like a smell.</v>

1773
01:20:23.640 --> 01:20:26.040
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think answer cannibals,</v>

1774
01:20:26.100 --> 01:20:29.130
<v Speaker 2>but look how crazy that is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This thing grows out of its body.</v>

1775
01:20:29.270 --> 01:20:34.270
<v Speaker 2>How is that any different than like</v>
<v Speaker 2>the promethium movie or alien movies?</v>

1776
01:20:36.900 --> 01:20:38.610
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1777
01:20:38.611 --> 01:20:39.510
<v Speaker 2>how was that different?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1778
01:20:39.540 --> 01:20:43.750
<v Speaker 2>it's really not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's some crazy organism that eats its</v>

1779
01:20:43.751 --> 01:20:48.751
<v Speaker 2>host and the ants look mushrooms</v>
<v Speaker 2>mushroom is that thrive off of carbon</v>

1780
01:20:51.631 --> 01:20:55.950
<v Speaker 2>monoxide or some day they're just like</v>
<v Speaker 2>us.</v>

1781
01:20:55.980 --> 01:20:58.800
<v Speaker 2>They eat oxygen and breathe carbon</v>
<v Speaker 2>dioxide.</v>

1782
01:20:58.830 --> 01:21:00.540
<v Speaker 2>Now here's a thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the quarter Zips,</v>

1783
01:21:00.541 --> 01:21:03.780
<v Speaker 2>mushrooms that get harvested for things</v>
<v Speaker 2>like on it,</v>

1784
01:21:03.781 --> 01:21:06.780
<v Speaker 2>shroom tech,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way they harvest those things is off</v>

1785
01:21:06.781 --> 01:21:08.400
<v Speaker 2>caterpillars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

1786
01:21:08.550 --> 01:21:09.383
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1787
01:21:10.250 --> 01:21:11.310
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like this,</v>

1788
01:21:11.390 --> 01:21:12.540
<v Speaker 2>he said it to so that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1789
01:21:12.560 --> 01:21:15.270
<v Speaker 2>that those mushrooms wouldn't be</v>
<v Speaker 2>psychedelic like it was in when he tried</v>

1790
01:21:15.271 --> 01:21:17.310
<v Speaker 2>to take those little ant mushrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1791
01:21:17.340 --> 01:21:20.580
<v Speaker 2>they're not psychedelic become some of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's a bunch of different</v>

1792
01:21:20.581 --> 01:21:25.410
<v Speaker 2>kinds of quarter subs mushroom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what they found is that high</v>

1793
01:21:25.411 --> 01:21:29.250
<v Speaker 2>altitude Yak herders or our cattle</v>
<v Speaker 2>herders think it was cattle.</v>

1794
01:21:29.280 --> 01:21:32.280
<v Speaker 2>I forget what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They noticed that when their animals</v>

1795
01:21:32.281 --> 01:21:36.720
<v Speaker 2>were eating these mushrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were more active and so they</v>

1796
01:21:36.721 --> 01:21:39.300
<v Speaker 2>started feeding their mushrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1797
01:21:39.301 --> 01:21:42.990
<v Speaker 2>feeding the mushrooms to people and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>had some pretty great results with it</v>

1798
01:21:43.320 --> 01:21:46.680
<v Speaker 2>and they started noticing that it helps</v>
<v Speaker 2>people and they did some studies on it.</v>

1799
01:21:46.681 --> 01:21:48.180
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can go to on it and you could read</v>

1800
01:21:48.181 --> 01:21:52.170
<v Speaker 2>the studies on cordyceps mushrooms or</v>
<v Speaker 2>just google it independently.</v>

1801
01:21:52.290 --> 01:21:54.120
<v Speaker 2>There's some interesting studies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Chinese,</v>

1802
01:21:54.990 --> 01:21:56.490
<v Speaker 2>see that's a little tricky though.</v>

1803
01:21:56.550 --> 01:21:59.850
<v Speaker 2>They say that Chinese Olympic team used</v>
<v Speaker 2>him and they want a bunch of metals.</v>

1804
01:22:00.570 --> 01:22:04.560
<v Speaker 2>Here's what's tricky about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's entirely likely that they said,</v>

1805
01:22:04.590 --> 01:22:06.780
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were only using them mushrooms.</v>

1806
01:22:06.960 --> 01:22:09.270
<v Speaker 2>Definitely no steroids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1807
01:22:10.710 --> 01:22:12.840
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the interest of full disclosure,</v>

1808
01:22:12.880 --> 01:22:14.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're in a fucking onnit tee shirt,</v>

1809
01:22:14.690 --> 01:22:15.523
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1810
01:22:16.620 --> 01:22:19.740
<v Speaker 2>It's entirely possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were doing steroids to most likely</v>

1811
01:22:19.770 --> 01:22:22.350
<v Speaker 2>that they were doing steroids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you see [inaudible] and you see</v>

1812
01:22:22.351 --> 01:22:24.780
<v Speaker 2>they're moving?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they're all doing steroids.</v>

1813
01:22:25.110 --> 01:22:29.220
<v Speaker 2>I think like especially all those</v>
<v Speaker 2>communist countries that rely so heavily</v>

1814
01:22:29.221 --> 01:22:32.000
<v Speaker 2>on propaganda like Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Russia has been doing state.</v>

1815
01:22:32.340 --> 01:22:36.500
<v Speaker 2>They had a state sponsored drug program</v>
<v Speaker 2>100% it's all documented in that,</v>

1816
01:22:36.550 --> 01:22:37.770
<v Speaker 2>that Mo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that movie.</v>

1817
01:22:37.980 --> 01:22:41.580
<v Speaker 2>So when China says that they want these</v>
<v Speaker 2>track and field metals because they were</v>

1818
01:22:41.581 --> 01:22:44.430
<v Speaker 2>taking this quarter steps mushroom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bet it helped,</v>

1819
01:22:44.880 --> 01:22:45.570
<v Speaker 2>but it helped.</v>

1820
01:22:45.570 --> 01:22:46.890
<v Speaker 2>I take it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but guess what?</v>

1821
01:22:46.891 --> 01:22:49.440
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't feel like a steroid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I take shroom tech,</v>

1822
01:22:49.441 --> 01:22:51.570
<v Speaker 2>it's like a nice little boost.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They get a little boost,</v>

1823
01:22:51.840 --> 01:22:53.010
<v Speaker 2>just a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not speedy,</v>

1824
01:22:53.011 --> 01:22:55.110
<v Speaker 2>but a little boost.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I definitely feel an extra gear,</v>

1825
01:22:55.410 --> 01:22:57.420
<v Speaker 2>but it ain't like I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1826
01:22:57.780 --> 01:23:00.510
<v Speaker 2>there's some else other shit too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those guys were doing,</v>

1827
01:23:01.280 --> 01:23:03.000
<v Speaker 2>they fucking do everything they can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1828
01:23:03.001 --> 01:23:06.040
<v Speaker 2>Anything they can get away with whatever</v>
<v Speaker 2>the they can get away with.</v>

1829
01:23:06.041 --> 01:23:08.260
<v Speaker 2>They do and they're not testing them all</v>
<v Speaker 2>the time.</v>

1830
01:23:08.680 --> 01:23:10.000
<v Speaker 2>They're just not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If there are,</v>

1831
01:23:10.001 --> 01:23:11.770
<v Speaker 2>they're hiding shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People get busted.</v>

1832
01:23:11.771 --> 01:23:14.260
<v Speaker 2>They've already proven that people get</v>
<v Speaker 2>busted and they let them slide.</v>

1833
01:23:14.680 --> 01:23:16.270
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of influence peddling.</v>

1834
01:23:16.300 --> 01:23:17.990
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe it would be less now because</v>

1835
01:23:18.610 --> 01:23:22.720
<v Speaker 2>Russia wasn't even allowed to compete</v>
<v Speaker 2>now that people had to compete under the</v>

1836
01:23:22.720 --> 01:23:25.900
<v Speaker 2>Olympic flag.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That certain athletes brush is so crazy.</v>

1837
01:23:26.440 --> 01:23:27.790
<v Speaker 2>You see that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do they killed in England?</v>

1838
01:23:28.210 --> 01:23:29.590
<v Speaker 2>The nerve gas?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is he dead yet?</v>

1839
01:23:30.740 --> 01:23:33.670
<v Speaker 2>Does him and his daughter or something</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that or his wife?</v>

1840
01:23:34.330 --> 01:23:36.280
<v Speaker 2>The killed him in England with nerve</v>
<v Speaker 2>gas.</v>

1841
01:23:36.490 --> 01:23:38.090
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1842
01:23:38.120 --> 01:23:39.790
<v Speaker 2>if he's not dead,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he might as well be dead.</v>

1843
01:23:40.150 --> 01:23:42.850
<v Speaker 2>He's on his way to dead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's incredibly horrible critical</v>

1844
01:23:42.851 --> 01:23:44.890
<v Speaker 2>condition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just like,</v>

1845
01:23:44.891 --> 01:23:48.190
<v Speaker 2>this is some spy versus spy shit and</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is some really,</v>

1846
01:23:48.191 --> 01:23:51.160
<v Speaker 2>it's like some movie shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're killing them with nerve gas.</v>

1847
01:23:51.490 --> 01:23:52.720
<v Speaker 2>They're killing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1848
01:23:54.070 --> 01:23:55.930
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he was like a double agent or</v>

1849
01:23:55.931 --> 01:23:58.330
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that what he was supposedly Russia's</v>

1850
01:23:58.331 --> 01:24:00.730
<v Speaker 2>now hacking our power grades.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh No.</v>

1851
01:24:01.120 --> 01:24:04.690
<v Speaker 2>Like I guess he didn't die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nathan.</v>

1852
01:24:04.730 --> 01:24:07.180
<v Speaker 2>If,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it was a Russian military grade</v>

1853
01:24:07.181 --> 01:24:08.620
<v Speaker 2>agent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would have died on the spot,</v>

1854
01:24:08.621 --> 01:24:10.210
<v Speaker 2>obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is what Putin said.</v>

1855
01:24:10.630 --> 01:24:11.950
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what Putin said.</v>

1856
01:24:12.820 --> 01:24:14.830
<v Speaker 2>Fuck cut.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We should definitely listen to him</v>

1857
01:24:14.831 --> 01:24:15.664
<v Speaker 2>always.</v>

1858
01:24:17.140 --> 01:24:20.380
<v Speaker 2>What is a remainer chronic critical</v>
<v Speaker 2>condition?</v>

1859
01:24:20.410 --> 01:24:22.360
<v Speaker 2>What did pull up a story on him?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who is he and why?</v>

1860
01:24:22.361 --> 01:24:25.630
<v Speaker 2>Why are they trying to whack this dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's in critical condition.</v>

1861
01:24:26.890 --> 01:24:27.430
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hold up.</v>

1862
01:24:27.430 --> 01:24:28.600
<v Speaker 2>Go Up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Scroll up.</v>

1863
01:24:29.320 --> 01:24:33.730
<v Speaker 2>Putin calls Russian poisoned x by</v>
<v Speaker 2>nonsense and delirium.</v>

1864
01:24:33.760 --> 01:24:35.710
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well then they definitely did it make</v>

1865
01:24:35.711 --> 01:24:37.770
<v Speaker 2>that bigger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1866
01:24:37.810 --> 01:24:42.810
<v Speaker 2>sloughed off the notion that Russia was</v>
<v Speaker 2>behind the poisoning former Russian spy</v>

1867
01:24:43.121 --> 01:24:46.600
<v Speaker 2>and his daughter saying any sensible</v>
<v Speaker 2>person would understand that this is</v>

1868
01:24:47.200 --> 01:24:50.320
<v Speaker 2>delirium and nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is unthinkable that we would do such</v>

1869
01:24:50.321 --> 01:24:53.380
<v Speaker 2>a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first thing that came to mind,</v>

1870
01:24:54.010 --> 01:24:58.060
<v Speaker 2>if it was a military grade agent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would have died on the spot on.</v>

1871
01:24:58.180 --> 01:25:00.970
<v Speaker 2>They would have died on the spot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obviously said Putin speaking in the</v>

1872
01:25:00.971 --> 01:25:04.600
<v Speaker 2>party headquarters in Moscow shortly</v>
<v Speaker 2>after he spoke to a crowd and central</v>

1873
01:25:04.601 --> 01:25:06.940
<v Speaker 2>Moscow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Russia does not have any such agents.</v>

1874
01:25:06.941 --> 01:25:10.390
<v Speaker 2>We destroyed it all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1875
01:25:10.750 --> 01:25:11.680
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe that</v>

1876
01:25:12.470 --> 01:25:15.560
<v Speaker 3>it puts an asa says he's never met trump</v>
<v Speaker 3>before the election.</v>

1877
01:25:15.561 --> 01:25:18.410
<v Speaker 3>And then there's like video from like</v>
<v Speaker 3>three years ago,</v>

1878
01:25:18.460 --> 01:25:20.090
<v Speaker 3>trump saying guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I met Putin,</v>

1879
01:25:20.091 --> 01:25:20.924
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and like,</v>

1880
01:25:20.960 --> 01:25:21.651
<v Speaker 3>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1881
01:25:21.651 --> 01:25:22.484
<v Speaker 3>It's just like,</v>

1882
01:25:22.590 --> 01:25:23.540
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bullshit.</v>

1883
01:25:23.720 --> 01:25:27.140
<v Speaker 2>Everything's bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a fun time though.</v>

1884
01:25:27.200 --> 01:25:29.060
<v Speaker 2>I hate it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think this is a fun time.</v>

1885
01:25:29.061 --> 01:25:30.650
<v Speaker 2>You like this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm okay.</v>

1886
01:25:31.580 --> 01:25:36.580
<v Speaker 2>I'm enjoying it because I think this is</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's fun about this time is,</v>

1887
01:25:37.041 --> 01:25:40.370
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even with like in this is partly because</v>

1888
01:25:40.371 --> 01:25:45.020
<v Speaker 2>we have a guy like trump in office is</v>
<v Speaker 2>that everything seems like there's</v>

1889
01:25:45.021 --> 01:25:47.630
<v Speaker 2>nobody at the wheel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything from top to bottom,</v>

1890
01:25:48.080 --> 01:25:51.590
<v Speaker 2>ms people scrambling and take the wheel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll take the wheel and right the ship,</v>

1891
01:25:51.860 --> 01:25:54.710
<v Speaker 2>but there's no one at the wheel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all craziness right now.</v>

1892
01:25:54.711 --> 01:25:56.030
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's culturally,</v>

1893
01:25:56.780 --> 01:25:58.280
<v Speaker 2>it's craziness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Politically.</v>

1894
01:25:58.970 --> 01:26:02.300
<v Speaker 2>It's craziness economically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like none of it makes any sense.</v>

1895
01:26:02.301 --> 01:26:04.010
<v Speaker 2>It's racially,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1896
01:26:04.010 --> 01:26:06.170
<v Speaker 5>people are fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people are mad at Bruno Mars,</v>

1897
01:26:06.750 --> 01:26:08.810
<v Speaker 5>Bruno,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bruno Mars or cultural appropriation.</v>

1898
01:26:08.811 --> 01:26:09.740
<v Speaker 5>How's that possible?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1899
01:26:09.741 --> 01:26:12.020
<v Speaker 5>there's so many different things that</v>
<v Speaker 5>are happening today that are so</v>

1900
01:26:12.021 --> 01:26:13.190
<v Speaker 5>outrageous.</v>

1975
01:29:37.500 --> 01:29:40.410
<v Speaker 5>I'm assuming he's not a Nazi.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm assuming he's a shit poster.</v>

1976
01:29:40.620 --> 01:29:43.530
<v Speaker 5>He's a guy who's trying to be funny.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I hundred percent.</v>

1977
01:29:43.680 --> 01:29:44.820
<v Speaker 5>That's just ignorance.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1978
01:29:44.821 --> 01:29:47.070
<v Speaker 5>and that funniness is funny to them.</v>

1979
01:29:47.190 --> 01:29:48.120
<v Speaker 5>See,</v>
<v Speaker 5>here's the thing.</v>

1980
01:29:48.390 --> 01:29:50.640
<v Speaker 5>You might not like it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You might think it's,</v>

1981
01:29:50.740 --> 01:29:52.590
<v Speaker 5>it's horribly and offensive,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but here's the thing.</v>

1982
01:29:52.591 --> 01:29:57.591
<v Speaker 5>No Jews got an ma got gassed during the</v>
<v Speaker 5>making of that video and the worst thing</v>

1983
01:29:58.411 --> 01:30:03.270
<v Speaker 5>it did is get racist to laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The best thing it did is get people to</v>

1984
01:30:03.271 --> 01:30:06.120
<v Speaker 5>talk about what's appropriate.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's nothing wrong with that.</v>

1985
01:30:06.180 --> 01:30:08.580
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean I don't like it.</v>

1986
01:30:08.610 --> 01:30:10.320
<v Speaker 5>I wouldn't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wouldn't tell people,</v>

1987
01:30:10.321 --> 01:30:12.480
<v Speaker 5>hey this is the most awesome video ever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Come watch it.</v>

1988
01:30:12.930 --> 01:30:16.440
<v Speaker 5>But to put that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not only to put him on trial but the</v>

1989
01:30:16.441 --> 01:30:19.980
<v Speaker 5>fucking convict him and Scotland,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how dare you,</v>

1990
01:30:20.220 --> 01:30:22.110
<v Speaker 5>you people are supposed to be ahead of</v>
<v Speaker 5>the curve.</v>

1991
01:30:22.350 --> 01:30:24.600
<v Speaker 5>Skyland supposed to be a pretty fucking</v>
<v Speaker 5>bad ass place.</v>

1992
01:30:25.650 --> 01:30:27.790
<v Speaker 5>That's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Isn't Scotland though?</v>

1993
01:30:27.800 --> 01:30:31.980
<v Speaker 5>Like the like the like a place that you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's Scotland where you can't</v>

1994
01:30:31.981 --> 01:30:33.630
<v Speaker 5>even talk about sex on stage.</v>

1995
01:30:33.630 --> 01:30:36.990
<v Speaker 5>You can cuss,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can like show you pull a tid out.</v>

1996
01:30:36.991 --> 01:30:39.090
<v Speaker 5>But like if you're talking to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to talk about sex,</v>

1997
01:30:39.091 --> 01:30:41.490
<v Speaker 5>I think it's Scotland.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a noble cause.</v>

1998
01:30:41.560 --> 01:30:45.480
<v Speaker 5>Billy Connolly's from Scotland to Billy</v>
<v Speaker 5>Connolly's a pretty famous worldwide</v>

1999
01:30:45.481 --> 01:30:46.610
<v Speaker 5>comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it sweet.</v>

2000
01:30:46.680 --> 01:30:48.960
<v Speaker 5>It's pretty outrageous guy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I might be thinking to Sweden.</v>

2001
01:30:49.200 --> 01:30:51.240
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Co Cause Connolly's pretty,</v>

<v Speaker 5>he's like in the line of like popular</v>

2003
01:30:56.191 --> 01:31:00.780
<v Speaker 5>American standup comics of his era.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was a very respected guy and he's</v>

2004
01:31:00.781 --> 01:31:02.020
<v Speaker 5>from Scotland.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It must be.</v>

2005
01:31:02.030 --> 01:31:04.800
<v Speaker 5>So I think I'm thinking of Sweden maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

2006
01:31:04.890 --> 01:31:07.500
<v Speaker 5>I don't know Jack Shit about those other</v>
<v Speaker 5>countries that I only visit</v>

2007
01:31:07.501 --> 01:31:08.370
<v Speaker 5>occasionally.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

2008
01:31:08.460 --> 01:31:09.270
<v Speaker 5>But,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but when you go to,</v>

2009
01:31:09.270 --> 01:31:11.130
<v Speaker 5>when you go to these countries to do</v>
<v Speaker 5>comedy,</v>

2010
01:31:11.131 --> 01:31:12.480
<v Speaker 5>do you ever have to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>

2011

<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

2012
01:31:14.220 --> 01:31:17.520
<v Speaker 5>I wouldn't go if I went to a place they</v>
<v Speaker 5>told me I couldn't talk about something,</v>

2013
01:31:17.550 --> 01:31:18.960
<v Speaker 5>I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well why would I go there?</v>

2014
01:31:18.970 --> 01:31:19.890
<v Speaker 5>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well I'll just go somewhere,</v>

2015
01:31:19.900 --> 01:31:22.470
<v Speaker 5>work and talk about anything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to go somewhere where only</v>

2016
01:31:22.471 --> 01:31:24.780
<v Speaker 5>talk about certain things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So like I,</v>

2017
01:31:24.781 --> 01:31:26.760
<v Speaker 5>I've done a few,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2018
01:31:26.790 --> 01:31:30.570
<v Speaker 5>air quote clean shows in my day where I</v>
<v Speaker 5>got a Gig,</v>

2019
01:31:30.571 --> 01:31:31.950
<v Speaker 5>especially when I was first starting</v>
<v Speaker 5>out.</v>

2020
01:31:31.951 --> 01:31:32.341
<v Speaker 5>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>

2021
01:31:32.341 --> 01:31:34.980
<v Speaker 5>can you do a half an hour clean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I go,</v>

2022
01:31:34.981 --> 01:31:35.850
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2023
01:31:35.851 --> 01:31:38.220
<v Speaker 5>And I would just edit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll just edit the shit out of</v>

2024
01:31:38.221 --> 01:31:40.170
<v Speaker 5>something.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Use words that you know,</v>

2025
01:31:40.430 --> 01:31:44.760
<v Speaker 5>there's like Innuendo that you could get</v>
<v Speaker 5>away with and I could sort of squeak by</v>

2026
01:31:44.761 --> 01:31:46.740
<v Speaker 5>with a bullshit half hour set,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

2027
01:31:47.610 --> 01:31:50.180
<v Speaker 5>But I would never do that today.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I don't want to,</v>

2028
01:31:50.550 --> 01:31:53.190
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just like what I want to be able to</v>

2029
01:31:53.191 --> 01:31:58.191
<v Speaker 5>do is find out what's the best way to</v>
<v Speaker 5>express the thoughts that are in my mind</v>

2030
01:31:58.960 --> 01:32:02.050
<v Speaker 5>that are funny.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Does the best way is never by censoring</v>

2031
01:32:02.051 --> 01:32:02.770
<v Speaker 5>yourself.</v>

2032
01:32:02.770 --> 01:32:05.800
<v Speaker 5>The best way is by figuring out what's</v>
<v Speaker 5>the best way to express yourself.</v>

2033
01:32:05.980 --> 01:32:08.710
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes censorship can be a tool</v>
<v Speaker 5>though for writing.</v>

2034
01:32:09.010 --> 01:32:11.590
<v Speaker 5>Like if you know that you can't swear or</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2035
01:32:11.710 --> 01:32:12.910
<v Speaker 5>like for joke writing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one of the,</v>

2036
01:32:12.911 --> 01:32:17.911
<v Speaker 5>one of the cool things about twitter was</v>
<v Speaker 5>that you had 140 characters.</v>

2037
01:32:17.951 --> 01:32:22.951
<v Speaker 5>Now obviously you have more of to 80 but</v>
<v Speaker 5>the one 40 made you write a joke very</v>

2038
01:32:23.711 --> 01:32:25.480
<v Speaker 5>concisely.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you want it to be funny,</v>

2039
01:32:25.990 --> 01:32:27.910
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you'd have to have set up punchline cut</v>

2040
01:32:27.911 --> 01:32:28.451
<v Speaker 5>out all that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're like,</v>

2041
01:32:28.451 --> 01:32:30.790
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm 10 10 letters over shit.</v>

2042
01:32:30.970 --> 01:32:33.040
<v Speaker 5>And you back it up a little.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh just take this out.</v>

2043
01:32:33.041 --> 01:32:36.550
<v Speaker 5>And I could say in one word,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it makes you understand that the economy</v>

2044
01:32:36.551 --> 01:32:39.340
<v Speaker 5>of words better.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And sometimes that's the case with</v>

2045
01:32:39.341 --> 01:32:42.160
<v Speaker 5>writing too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like you can get out of a joke easy by</v>

2046
01:32:42.161 --> 01:32:46.060
<v Speaker 5>just adding swear words or adding sexual</v>
<v Speaker 5>innuendo or stuff like that.</v>

2047
01:32:47.020 --> 01:32:49.540
<v Speaker 5>But that doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that,</v>

2048
01:32:49.660 --> 01:32:53.500
<v Speaker 5>that's like just an exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like when you're actually expressing</v>

2049
01:32:53.501 --> 01:32:55.450
<v Speaker 5>yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you're actually doing the work,</v>

2050
01:32:55.451 --> 01:32:56.950
<v Speaker 5>like going on stage,</v>
<v Speaker 5>doing a show,</v>

2051
01:32:57.250 --> 01:32:59.560
<v Speaker 5>you should be able to do whatever the</v>
<v Speaker 5>fuck you want.</v>

2052
01:32:59.561 --> 01:33:03.400
<v Speaker 5>Otherwise it's not stand up and it's</v>
<v Speaker 5>either funny or it's not funny.</v>

2053
01:33:03.610 --> 01:33:05.950
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's not funny.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You just weren't funny.</v>

2054
01:33:06.160 --> 01:33:10.240
<v Speaker 5>But it's not because it's the subject</v>
<v Speaker 5>matter that's just fucking stupid.</v>

2055
01:33:10.450 --> 01:33:12.970
<v Speaker 5>That's stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cause anything can be almost anything</v>

2056
01:33:12.971 --> 01:33:15.520
<v Speaker 5>can be funny.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I'm sure there's probably a few</v>

2057
01:33:15.550 --> 01:33:18.130
<v Speaker 5>things that can't be,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but for the most part,</v>

2058
01:33:18.131 --> 01:33:20.170
<v Speaker 5>if you think it's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you have a point,</v>

2059
01:33:20.740 --> 01:33:21.573
<v Speaker 5>it's possible.</v>

2060
01:33:21.750 --> 01:33:23.640
<v Speaker 6>Did you see what happened with Hannibal</v>
<v Speaker 6>the other day?</v>

2061
01:33:23.700 --> 01:33:24.930
<v Speaker 6>Another thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2062
01:33:24.931 --> 01:33:25.351
<v Speaker 6>He,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2063
01:33:25.351 --> 01:33:30.351
<v Speaker 6>when he got a Gig at Loyola Chicago and</v>
<v Speaker 6>they cut his mic after he supposedly</v>

2064
01:33:31.860 --> 01:33:34.230
<v Speaker 6>said some stuff that they mutually</v>
<v Speaker 6>agreed he shouldn't say,</v>

2065
01:33:34.231 --> 01:33:38.700
<v Speaker 6>but what he put the email up on a</v>
<v Speaker 6>projector I guess and was making jokes</v>

2066
01:33:38.701 --> 01:33:39.750
<v Speaker 6>about the Catholic church.</v>

2067
01:33:40.280 --> 01:33:45.230
<v Speaker 5>Hannibal burress sex standup set is</v>
<v Speaker 5>interrupted at Layola after his sex</v>

2068
01:33:45.231 --> 01:33:46.100
<v Speaker 5>abuse joke</v>

2069
01:33:47.010 --> 01:33:49.510
<v Speaker 6>and it cut his mic and then everyone</v>
<v Speaker 6>started booing.</v>

2070
01:33:49.511 --> 01:33:52.120
<v Speaker 6>Everyone was laughing apparently.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And all the kids are saying,</v>

2071
01:33:52.121 --> 01:33:53.320
<v Speaker 6>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they should have known what they were</v>

2072
01:33:53.350 --> 01:33:55.060
<v Speaker 6>getting themselves into basically.</v>

2073
01:33:55.690 --> 01:33:57.160
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can't do colleges,</v>

2074
01:33:57.161 --> 01:33:59.290

<v Speaker 5>I've been telling people you can't do</v>

2075
01:33:59.291 --> 01:34:01.930
<v Speaker 5>colleges.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not worth it.</v>

2076
01:34:02.770 --> 01:34:05.080
<v Speaker 5>It's not worth it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a lot of money though.</v>

2077
01:34:05.200 --> 01:34:07.630
<v Speaker 5>That's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>College is we'll pay you some serious</v>

2078
01:34:07.631 --> 01:34:10.210
<v Speaker 5>cash.</v>

<v Speaker 5>College Campus Activities,</v>

<v Speaker 5>It was great.</v>

2084
01:34:25.930 --> 01:34:28.180
<v Speaker 5>Like I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that was the first time I made good</v>

2085
01:34:28.181 --> 01:34:30.670
<v Speaker 5>money.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would travel and go to all these</v>

01:34:35.080 --> 01:34:38.260
<v Speaker 5>some university there and some weird</v>
<v Speaker 5>university in the middle of nowhere in</v>

2088
01:34:38.261 --> 01:34:40.420
<v Speaker 5>Ohio.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they take you out to some local</v>

2089
01:34:40.421 --> 01:34:43.020
<v Speaker 5>fucking country bar afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're doing shots with kids,</v>

2090
01:34:43.030 --> 01:34:47.230
<v Speaker 5>go to school there because I was</v>
<v Speaker 5>basically their age or a couple of years</v>

2091
01:34:47.230 --> 01:34:47.380
<v Speaker 5>older.</v>

2092
01:34:47.380 --> 01:34:51.640
<v Speaker 5>This is when I was like 23 or 24 may me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2093
01:34:51.641 --> 01:34:54.820
<v Speaker 5>and they were all like 20 so we're all</v>
<v Speaker 5>like in the same wheelhouse.</v>

2094
01:34:55.600 --> 01:34:57.380
<v Speaker 5>And then there people that work at the</v>
<v Speaker 5>school that were older,</v>

2095
01:34:57.381 --> 01:34:59.630
<v Speaker 5>they come out drink and when you two</v>
<v Speaker 5>different times fan,</v>

2096
01:35:00.080 --> 01:35:05.060
<v Speaker 5>but you could make real money like you</v>
<v Speaker 5>do a Gig and you'd make $1,000 or $1,500</v>

2097
01:35:05.061 --> 01:35:10.010
<v Speaker 5>or $2,000 like holy shit for one show is</v>
<v Speaker 5>crazy for an unknown comedian.</v>

2098
01:35:10.640 --> 01:35:14.120
<v Speaker 5>So everybody like aspired to do those</v>
<v Speaker 5>college gigs.</v>

2099
01:35:14.240 --> 01:35:18.560
<v Speaker 5>But back then man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>even back then they were real sensitive.</v>

2100
01:35:18.740 --> 01:35:21.410
<v Speaker 5>Kids are real sensitive and they're</v>
<v Speaker 5>always looking to,</v>

2101
01:35:21.620 --> 01:35:23.840
<v Speaker 5>they don't have a lot of life experience</v>
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

2102
01:35:24.110 --> 01:35:26.660
<v Speaker 5>So their life experience is limited to</v>
<v Speaker 5>18 years.</v>

2103
01:35:26.661 --> 01:35:29.720
<v Speaker 5>Most of it's been under the care of</v>
<v Speaker 5>their parents for most kids.</v>

2104
01:35:30.040 --> 01:35:33.230
<v Speaker 5>And then all of a sudden they're at</v>
<v Speaker 5>school and they're flexing their wings</v>

2105
01:35:33.231 --> 01:35:37.070
<v Speaker 5>and their muscles and you know the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the objective things and they've decided</v>

2106
01:35:37.071 --> 01:35:39.530
<v Speaker 5>that these things are inappropriate and</v>
<v Speaker 5>these things shouldn't be said.</v>

2107
01:35:39.680 --> 01:35:42.250
<v Speaker 5>And this isn't true.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They can't take certain,</v>

2108
01:35:42.880 --> 01:35:45.620
<v Speaker 5>they can't take a lot of sarcasm.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They don't know.</v>

2109
01:35:45.650 --> 01:35:46.210
<v Speaker 5>I mean they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

2110
01:35:46.210 --> 01:35:50.840
<v Speaker 5>they take you literally too often they</v>
<v Speaker 5>think some subjects or just period taboo</v>

2111
01:35:50.841 --> 01:35:55.760
<v Speaker 5>because they are period taboo in offices</v>
<v Speaker 5>and in some schools and there's some</v>

2112
01:35:55.761 --> 01:35:57.920
<v Speaker 5>things they can't say.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So if they can't say they don't want you</v>

2113
01:35:57.921 --> 01:36:00.410
<v Speaker 5>to say it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a very weird time for kids.</v>

2114
01:36:00.980 --> 01:36:03.890
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's why it's so crazy that you have</v>

2115
01:36:03.891 --> 01:36:08.750
<v Speaker 5>all these fucking dorks that are stuck</v>
<v Speaker 5>in that system,</v>

2116
01:36:09.020 --> 01:36:12.050
<v Speaker 5>that graduated from college,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then started teaching and have these</v>

2117
01:36:12.051 --> 01:36:16.850
<v Speaker 5>ridiculous Marxist ideas and loony</v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking left wing ideologies and they're</v>

2118
01:36:17.120 --> 01:36:22.120
<v Speaker 5>brainwashing these kids about gender</v>
<v Speaker 5>neutral or gender fluidity and making</v>

2119
01:36:22.401 --> 01:36:26.720
<v Speaker 5>safe spaces and all this stupid shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like what what you're doing is,</v>

2120
01:36:26.721 --> 01:36:31.040
<v Speaker 5>is like further cushioning and coddling</v>
<v Speaker 5>them and then they're just what,</v>

2121
01:36:31.050 --> 01:36:31.760
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what are they gonna do?</v>

2122
01:36:31.760 --> 01:36:34.130
<v Speaker 5>They're gonna just gonna join academia</v>
<v Speaker 5>as well.</v>

2123
01:36:34.250 --> 01:36:36.530
<v Speaker 5>They're going to get through their</v>
<v Speaker 5>schooling and then teach in this weird</v>

2124
01:36:36.531 --> 01:36:39.170
<v Speaker 5>insulated little thought bubble that you</v>
<v Speaker 5>guys have created.</v>

2125
01:36:39.410 --> 01:36:44.030
<v Speaker 5>So when people look at these people</v>
<v Speaker 5>screaming and yelling and calling people</v>

2126
01:36:44.031 --> 01:36:47.660
<v Speaker 5>Nazis and on school campuses and all</v>
<v Speaker 5>this fucking chaos that's going on,</v>

2127
01:36:47.870 --> 01:36:50.990
<v Speaker 5>this is what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is what happens when you baby</v>

2128
01:36:50.991 --> 01:36:52.980
<v Speaker 5>people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is what happens when you,</v>

2129
01:36:52.981 --> 01:36:57.890
<v Speaker 5>you set up this environment where they</v>
<v Speaker 5>can never ever interface with the real</v>

2130
01:36:57.891 --> 01:37:00.440
<v Speaker 5>world.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They just exist in this super</v>

2131
01:37:00.441 --> 01:37:03.740
<v Speaker 5>hypersensitive,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hyper progressive bubble where nothing</v>

2132
01:37:03.741 --> 01:37:05.780
<v Speaker 5>is produced.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nothing is created.</v>

2133
01:37:05.930 --> 01:37:09.590
<v Speaker 5>You just teaching people ideas and</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're teaching people ideas and the</v>

2134
01:37:09.591 --> 01:37:13.430
<v Speaker 5>ideas are being,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're being promoted by a person who</v>

2135
01:37:13.460 --> 01:37:17.810
<v Speaker 5>in a lot of situations has never even</v>
<v Speaker 5>been out in the real world working like</v>

2136
01:37:17.811 --> 01:37:20.630
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a bullshit fucking thing.</v>

2137
01:37:20.631 --> 01:37:22.850
<v Speaker 5>And then they have tenure so they can</v>
<v Speaker 5>never be fired.</v>

2138
01:37:25.030 --> 01:37:26.330
<v Speaker 5>Whew.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's crazy.</v>

2139
01:37:26.360 --> 01:37:29.630
<v Speaker 5>Nerfing it's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's pretty fascinating.</v>

2140
01:37:29.631 --> 01:37:31.190
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know that this,</v>

2141
01:37:31.191 --> 01:37:32.300
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>these are these.</v>

2142
01:37:32.450 --> 01:37:37.060
<v Speaker 5>They're in a lot of ways it's kind of</v>
<v Speaker 5>like royalty and a lot of ways it's kind</v>

2143
01:37:37.061 --> 01:37:39.200
<v Speaker 5>of like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like weird political systems that get</v>

2144
01:37:39.201 --> 01:37:40.550
<v Speaker 5>corrupt,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like things,</v>

2145
01:37:40.551 --> 01:37:43.580
<v Speaker 5>ideas get corrupt as much as like</v>
<v Speaker 5>finances get corrupt.</v>

2146
01:37:43.970 --> 01:37:48.970
<v Speaker 5>Like people feel a way to extract social</v>
<v Speaker 5>points for by promoting their ideas and</v>

2147
01:37:50.151 --> 01:37:52.490
<v Speaker 5>by,</v>
<v Speaker 5>by forcing their ideas down other</v>

2148
01:37:52.491 --> 01:37:55.040
<v Speaker 5>people's throats and having them accept</v>
<v Speaker 5>it and mimic that as well.</v>

2149
01:37:55.200 --> 01:37:58.530
<v Speaker 5>And also reinforce it that they're doing</v>
<v Speaker 5>their life right and everybody else is</v>

2150
01:37:58.531 --> 01:38:01.410
<v Speaker 5>doing their live wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it becomes this weird psychological</v>

2151
01:38:01.560 --> 01:38:04.410
<v Speaker 5>wrestling match that people are doing</v>
<v Speaker 5>with people.</v>

2152
01:38:04.780 --> 01:38:06.150
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the outside world.</v>

2153
01:38:06.780 --> 01:38:07.071
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've,</v>

2154
01:38:07.071 --> 01:38:09.060
<v Speaker 5>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've had a lot of guests on to talk</v>

2155
01:38:09.061 --> 01:38:11.190
<v Speaker 5>about this subject,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I think this subject,</v>

2156
01:38:12.330 --> 01:38:16.020
<v Speaker 5>it's one of the reasons why it rings</v>
<v Speaker 5>true to people is because I think we all</v>

2157
01:38:16.021 --> 01:38:18.960
<v Speaker 5>realize this is happening in just in</v>
<v Speaker 5>life in general,</v>

2158
01:38:19.320 --> 01:38:23.220
<v Speaker 5>and there's a lot of weird control</v>
<v Speaker 5>battles going on in life in general.</v>

2159
01:38:23.520 --> 01:38:28.440
<v Speaker 5>And in telling a guy that he can't have</v>
<v Speaker 5>his dog say,</v>

2160
01:38:28.441 --> 01:38:30.780
<v Speaker 5>see,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't say sieg heil his dog and his</v>

2161
01:38:30.781 --> 01:38:33.600
<v Speaker 5>dog lift his arm up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>telling you the guy that he can't do</v>

2162
01:38:33.601 --> 01:38:35.820
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just stupid because you're,</v>

2163
01:38:35.821 --> 01:38:38.130
<v Speaker 5>you're making it a way bigger thing that</v>
<v Speaker 5>it should be.</v>

2164
01:38:38.250 --> 01:38:40.710
<v Speaker 5>It should be a stupid video that no one</v>
<v Speaker 5>cares about.</v>

2165
01:38:40.740 --> 01:38:42.360
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's still up on youtube.</v>

2166
01:38:42.361 --> 01:38:47.160
<v Speaker 5>So that shows you how stupid it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yanked Shit left and right.</v>

2167
01:38:47.610 --> 01:38:50.940
<v Speaker 5>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You see what youtube did to a crowder</v>

2168
01:38:50.980 --> 01:38:52.770
<v Speaker 5>when Steven crowder went to this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2169
01:38:52.800 --> 01:38:57.800
<v Speaker 5>they went to a Lbgtq,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a event in Austin and he had a dude show</v>

2170
01:39:00.211 --> 01:39:04.590
<v Speaker 5>up and saying that he identifies as a</v>
<v Speaker 5>robot and he says all this really rude</v>

2171
01:39:04.591 --> 01:39:05.560
<v Speaker 5>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Twitter,</v>

2172
01:39:05.561 --> 01:39:06.720
<v Speaker 5>it got him in trouble now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Youtube,</v>

2173
01:39:06.900 --> 01:39:09.300
<v Speaker 5>youtube was youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Still have it up.</v>

2174
01:39:09.600 --> 01:39:10.710
<v Speaker 5>I thought they put it up there.</v>

2175
01:39:10.740 --> 01:39:13.080
<v Speaker 5>I thought it was dee dee monetized or</v>
<v Speaker 5>twitter.</v>

2176
01:39:13.120 --> 01:39:15.960
<v Speaker 5>Bandom yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I thought Youtube bandom as well.</v>

2177
01:39:16.110 --> 01:39:18.420
<v Speaker 5>Facebook bandom no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>someone has to.</v>

2178
01:39:19.080 --> 01:39:22.290
<v Speaker 5>Someone else did too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It might be youtube check.</v>

2179
01:39:23.010 --> 01:39:25.800
<v Speaker 5>Either way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2180
01:39:26.610 --> 01:39:29.730
<v Speaker 5>people are trying to control what people</v>
<v Speaker 5>do and don't say.</v>

2181
01:39:29.970 --> 01:39:32.430
<v Speaker 5>And I think when you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you run into real problems.</v>

2182
01:39:32.431 --> 01:39:34.950
<v Speaker 5>Like who the fuck are you?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Who are you,</v>

2183
01:39:35.070 --> 01:39:38.160
<v Speaker 5>who you to decide,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2184
01:39:38.960 --> 01:39:43.290
<v Speaker 5>and even know Noam Chomsky said</v>
<v Speaker 5>something about Sam Harrison,</v>

2185
01:39:43.770 --> 01:39:48.770
<v Speaker 5>Jordan Peterson that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>free speech does not impro does not</v>

2186
01:39:49.021 --> 01:39:51.300
<v Speaker 5>apply to hate speech.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like why?</v>

2187
01:39:51.360 --> 01:39:54.090
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yes it does.</v>

2188
01:39:54.540 --> 01:39:55.410
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it does.</v>

2189
01:39:55.470 --> 01:39:59.550
<v Speaker 5>That's crazy that someone who's really</v>
<v Speaker 5>smart can say it doesn't.</v>

2190
01:39:59.580 --> 01:40:00.301
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

2191
01:40:00.301 --> 01:40:02.540
<v Speaker 5>So it's available on Youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2192
01:40:03.210 --> 01:40:06.600
<v Speaker 5>he say he puts some posting saying that</v>
<v Speaker 5>he was blocked from something.</v>

2193
01:40:08.140 --> 01:40:10.680
<v Speaker 5>Doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The point is,</v>

2194
01:40:11.400 --> 01:40:16.260
<v Speaker 5>one thing that's been shown is that</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're trying to silence more.</v>

2195
01:40:16.320 --> 01:40:21.320
<v Speaker 5>They're trying to stop the spread of</v>
<v Speaker 5>conservative ideology and spread liberal</v>

2196
01:40:22.771 --> 01:40:25.380
<v Speaker 5>ideology.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like they're actively trying to do that.</v>

2197
01:40:25.710 --> 01:40:30.710
<v Speaker 5>I feel like there's a real worry that</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you have a platform,</v>

2198
01:40:32.131 --> 01:40:33.690
<v Speaker 5>whether it's youtube or something like</v>
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

2199
01:40:34.830 --> 01:40:38.340
<v Speaker 5>that you could get infected,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but like say shit posters,</v>

2200
01:40:38.341 --> 01:40:40.230
<v Speaker 5>if ship posters just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're more,</v>

2201
01:40:40.710 --> 01:40:43.050
<v Speaker 5>they're more prolific right there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

2202
01:40:43.051 --> 01:40:44.970
<v Speaker 5>if you look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just look at the comments on Youtube,</v>

2203
01:40:45.370 --> 01:40:48.690
<v Speaker 5>like in a lot of like really popular</v>
<v Speaker 5>things that comments are horrific,</v>

2204
01:40:49.170 --> 01:40:53.740
<v Speaker 5>like way disproportionate to how they</v>
<v Speaker 5>would be in the real world.</v>

2205
01:40:53.980 --> 01:40:57.430
<v Speaker 5>Like the comments and the p,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the anger that you find in a lot of</v>

2206
01:40:57.431 --> 01:40:59.050
<v Speaker 5>youtube videos,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially if you look at like the</v>

2207
01:40:59.051 --> 01:41:01.540
<v Speaker 5>comments of podcasts.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Holy Shit Dude.</v>

2208
01:41:01.541 --> 01:41:03.060
<v Speaker 5>People are opinionated,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2209
01:41:03.070 --> 01:41:05.060
<v Speaker 5>They've got some crazy wild fucking</v>
<v Speaker 5>opinion.</v>

2210
01:41:05.130 --> 01:41:06.070
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you were youtube,</v>

2211
01:41:06.071 --> 01:41:09.100
<v Speaker 5>you'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we have to figure out a way to stop</v>

2212
01:41:09.310 --> 01:41:12.790
<v Speaker 5>people from saying Faggot or we have to</v>
<v Speaker 5>figure out a way to stop people from</v>

2213
01:41:12.791 --> 01:41:15.040
<v Speaker 5>doing this or stop people from,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2214
01:41:15.100 --> 01:41:16.750
<v Speaker 5>from being homophobic.</v>

2215
01:41:16.750 --> 01:41:19.330
<v Speaker 5>We have to figure out a way to stop</v>
<v Speaker 5>people from supporting trump.</v>

2216
01:41:19.450 --> 01:41:22.780
<v Speaker 5>We have to figure out a way to stop</v>
<v Speaker 5>people from talking about the wall.</v>

2217
01:41:22.930 --> 01:41:26.170
<v Speaker 5>You have to figure out a way and as soon</v>
<v Speaker 5>as you start doing that kind of stuff,</v>

2218
01:41:26.920 --> 01:41:30.600
<v Speaker 5>you run into a real slippery when you're</v>
<v Speaker 5>deciding what people shouldn't,</v>

2219
01:41:30.610 --> 01:41:32.800
<v Speaker 5>shouldn't be able to say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>even if it's legal.</v>

2220
01:41:33.460 --> 01:41:36.400
<v Speaker 5>That gets real weird because then you</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't have a free speech platform.</v>

2221
01:41:36.401 --> 01:41:40.360
<v Speaker 5>You have a left wing platform like your,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your platform has now left wing,</v>

2222
01:41:40.361 --> 01:41:43.030
<v Speaker 5>and I'm not saying you're wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I'm saying it,</v>

2223
01:41:43.110 --> 01:41:48.100
<v Speaker 5>it strengthens the position of the</v>
<v Speaker 5>people that you oppose because they are</v>

2224
01:41:48.101 --> 01:41:49.570
<v Speaker 5>being suppressed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like you could see there being</v>

2225
01:41:49.571 --> 01:41:51.640
<v Speaker 5>suppressed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Even if they're wrong,</v>

2226
01:41:52.030 --> 01:41:54.490
<v Speaker 5>you put a guy in jail because his dog</v>
<v Speaker 5>says,</v>

2227
01:41:54.700 --> 01:41:58.280
<v Speaker 5>listen Paul,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when he says see high like boy you,</v>

2228
01:41:58.281 --> 01:42:03.280
<v Speaker 5>you just looked real fucking stupid to</v>
<v Speaker 5>most people and now the fight is on and</v>

2229
01:42:03.281 --> 01:42:07.180
<v Speaker 5>now it's going to be this swarm of</v>
<v Speaker 5>controversy where people are freaking,</v>

2230
01:42:07.181 --> 01:42:08.560
<v Speaker 5>I just found out about it yesterday.</v>

2231
01:42:09.100 --> 01:42:12.170
<v Speaker 5>I just found out about it last night I</v>
<v Speaker 5>think might not even,</v>

2232
01:42:12.171 --> 01:42:13.570
<v Speaker 5>it might might've been this morning when</v>
<v Speaker 5>I woke up.</v>

2233
01:42:13.930 --> 01:42:16.690
<v Speaker 5>Youtube has reported,</v>
<v Speaker 5>did you care about your kids?</v>

2234
01:42:17.090 --> 01:42:20.020
<v Speaker 5>Because what this famous conspiracy</v>
<v Speaker 5>theorists,</v>

2235
01:42:20.290 --> 01:42:24.910
<v Speaker 5>his videos have been coming up in the</v>
<v Speaker 5>youtube kids app teaching like flat</v>

2236
01:42:24.911 --> 01:42:26.880
<v Speaker 5>earth Type Shit and like we didn't get</v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

2237
01:42:26.881 --> 01:42:30.760
<v Speaker 5>The planet or moon good stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2238
01:42:30.860 --> 01:42:33.480
<v Speaker 5>a good mood.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Getting into a lot of where they can,</v>

2239
01:42:33.640 --> 01:42:34.930
<v Speaker 5>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is too much.</v>

2240
01:42:35.200 --> 01:42:37.360
<v Speaker 5>Here's the thing about youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 5>now,</v>

2241
01:42:37.361 --> 01:42:40.570
<v Speaker 5>this is in defense of them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because I'd talked though I had dinner</v>

2242
01:42:40.571 --> 01:42:44.440
<v Speaker 5>with some big wigs at Youtube and there</v>
<v Speaker 5>was some of the stuff they said was very</v>

2243
01:42:44.441 --> 01:42:48.700
<v Speaker 5>annoying and not recalling things,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hate speech that just weren't like,</v>

2244
01:42:48.701 --> 01:42:51.610
<v Speaker 5>I'm talking about someone who got a</v>
<v Speaker 5>community guideline strike because they</v>

2245
01:42:51.611 --> 01:42:53.620
<v Speaker 5>put a cup,</v>
<v Speaker 5>put a conversation up in their playlist</v>

2246
01:42:54.010 --> 01:42:59.010
<v Speaker 5>between Sam Harris and um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Douglas Murray to intellectuals and</v>

2247
01:43:01.061 --> 01:43:01.281
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

2248
01:43:01.281 --> 01:43:03.580
<v Speaker 5>they said that it was because it was</v>
<v Speaker 5>hate speech and I was like,</v>

2249
01:43:03.581 --> 01:43:05.380
<v Speaker 5>that is the fact.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They could just say,</v>

2250
01:43:05.381 --> 01:43:09.670
<v Speaker 5>that just drove me nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But they're dealing with who knows how</v>

2251
01:43:09.671 --> 01:43:11.140
<v Speaker 5>many videos every day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2252
01:43:11.141 --> 01:43:12.460
<v Speaker 5>it's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How could they,</v>

2253
01:43:12.940 --> 01:43:14.890
<v Speaker 5>how could they possibly even know the</v>
<v Speaker 5>videos?</v>

2254
01:43:15.130 --> 01:43:17.170
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The total number of people use Youtube</v>

2255
01:43:17.171 --> 01:43:19.210
<v Speaker 5>is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what is that number?</v>

2256
01:43:19.690 --> 01:43:20.680
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God.</v>

2257
01:43:23.140 --> 01:43:25.990
<v Speaker 5>301 billion.</v>
<v Speaker 5>300 million,</v>

2258
01:43:27.010 --> 01:43:29.890
<v Speaker 5>300 hours of video uploaded to youtube</v>
<v Speaker 5>every minute.</v>

2259
01:43:29.950 --> 01:43:34.690
<v Speaker 5>Almost 5 billion videos are watched on</v>
<v Speaker 5>youtube every single day in an average</v>

2260
01:43:34.690 --> 01:43:37.000
<v Speaker 5>month,</v>
<v Speaker 5>eight out of 10 18 to 49 year olds watch</v>

2261
01:43:37.010 --> 01:43:39.100
<v Speaker 5>youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One of the things this woman said to me</v>

2262
01:43:39.101 --> 01:43:42.070
<v Speaker 5>that I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I agree with her on and I mean I believe</v>

2263
01:43:42.071 --> 01:43:45.070
<v Speaker 5>her because this is not about about</v>
<v Speaker 5>opinion,</v>

2264
01:43:45.940 --> 01:43:48.010
<v Speaker 5>is about the way youtube works.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She said,</v>

2265
01:43:48.011 --> 01:43:52.310
<v Speaker 5>right now we have very crude tools to</v>
<v Speaker 5>find the offensive hate speech.</v>

2266
01:43:52.350 --> 01:43:56.690
<v Speaker 5>They're very crude tools.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes the Mr Mark and sometimes when</v>

2267
01:43:56.720 --> 01:43:59.480
<v Speaker 5>you're dealing with like subtlety,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like humor,</v>

2268
01:43:59.810 --> 01:44:01.400
<v Speaker 5>like I could say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hey you fuck.</v>

2269
01:44:01.640 --> 01:44:02.840
<v Speaker 5>And you know people go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

2270
01:44:02.841 --> 01:44:04.550
<v Speaker 5>he was angry.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like obviously not.</v>

2271
01:44:04.610 --> 01:44:07.400
<v Speaker 5>You hear the tone,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know like someone saying that</v>

2272
01:44:07.401 --> 01:44:09.080
<v Speaker 5>they're saying it to friends and they're</v>
<v Speaker 5>joking around,</v>

2273
01:44:09.081 --> 01:44:10.730
<v Speaker 5>they're being silly and everybody's</v>
<v Speaker 5>laughing.</v>

2274
01:44:11.990 --> 01:44:13.910
<v Speaker 5>Youtube misses that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They don't,</v>

2275
01:44:13.940 --> 01:44:16.070
<v Speaker 5>they don't know what's humor and what's</v>
<v Speaker 5>not.</v>

2276
01:44:16.190 --> 01:44:19.460
<v Speaker 5>So are you saying that you can never</v>
<v Speaker 5>make a joke about,</v>

2277
01:44:19.550 --> 01:44:21.530
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a guy's Dick or you can never make a</v>

2278
01:44:21.531 --> 01:44:25.760
<v Speaker 5>joke about a girl's vagina or you never</v>
<v Speaker 5>big joke about heterosexual sex,</v>

<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2280

<v Speaker 5>you can do that.</v>

2281
01:44:27.321 --> 01:44:29.300
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Can I make a joke about gay sex?</v>

2282
01:44:29.690 --> 01:44:30.530
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2283
01:44:30.531 --> 01:44:32.210
<v Speaker 5>you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2284
01:44:32.211 --> 01:44:33.500
<v Speaker 5>I see.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because I'm not gay.</v>

2285
01:44:33.710 --> 01:44:35.810
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Can I make a joke about why people,</v>

2286
01:44:35.840 --> 01:44:37.610
<v Speaker 5>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Can you make a joke about black people?</v>

2287
01:44:37.640 --> 01:44:38.910
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2288
01:44:38.980 --> 01:44:41.060
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What do we do in here?</v>

2289
01:44:41.330 --> 01:44:43.850
<v Speaker 5>What are we doing?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're deciding what people can and</v>

2290
01:44:43.851 --> 01:44:46.880
<v Speaker 5>can't say.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then they're also demonetizing</v>

2291
01:44:46.881 --> 01:44:50.300
<v Speaker 5>things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And we've had some demonetize ones that</v>

2292
01:44:50.301 --> 01:44:50.931
<v Speaker 5>were just like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

2293
01:44:50.931 --> 01:44:53.390
<v Speaker 5>there's gotta be some sort of an</v>
<v Speaker 5>algorithm going on here where there's a</v>

2294
01:44:53.391 --> 01:44:58.160
<v Speaker 5>word we say and that word triggers some</v>
<v Speaker 5>sort of a response and then they say</v>

2295
01:44:58.161 --> 01:44:59.120
<v Speaker 5>that it's up for,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we,</v>

2296
01:44:59.140 --> 01:45:01.010
<v Speaker 5>we,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we have it up for manual review</v>

2297
01:45:01.011 --> 01:45:02.330
<v Speaker 5>sometimes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the,</v>

2298
01:45:02.400 --> 01:45:06.260
<v Speaker 5>our Douglas Murray one where we talked</v>
<v Speaker 5>about youtube demonetizing videos,</v>

2299
01:45:06.410 --> 01:45:09.650
<v Speaker 5>that one got demonetized he says,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so it's like,</v>

2300
01:45:09.651 --> 01:45:11.660
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>are they doing that to fuck with us or</v>

2301
01:45:11.661 --> 01:45:14.270
<v Speaker 5>are they doing that because he douglas</v>
<v Speaker 5>talked about,</v>

2302
01:45:14.300 --> 01:45:16.700
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>radical fundamentalist Islam.</v>

2303
01:45:16.790 --> 01:45:19.310
<v Speaker 5>Like what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And their defense,</v>

2304
01:45:19.311 --> 01:45:21.890
<v Speaker 5>it's just that their platform,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they should be able to do whatever they</v>

2305
01:45:21.891 --> 01:45:22.760
<v Speaker 5>want.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Should they though,</v>

2306
01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:24.860
<v Speaker 5>because what are they then?</v>
<v Speaker 5>If it's,</v>

2307
01:45:24.861 --> 01:45:26.780
<v Speaker 5>who is they?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Who is they?</v>

2308
01:45:26.781 --> 01:45:29.390
<v Speaker 5>The people they hired like doesn't that</v>
<v Speaker 5>shift?</v>

2309
01:45:29.540 --> 01:45:33.620
<v Speaker 5>Like the assumption is that everybody</v>
<v Speaker 5>who works in management,</v>

2310
01:45:33.621 --> 01:45:37.130
<v Speaker 5>everybody who works behind the scenes</v>
<v Speaker 5>all shares a mindset.</v>

2311
01:45:37.160 --> 01:45:39.350
<v Speaker 5>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That doesn't even make any sense.</v>

2312
01:45:39.351 --> 01:45:43.100
<v Speaker 5>That's not even the society like group</v>
<v Speaker 5>think tanks like that.</v>

2313
01:45:43.130 --> 01:45:43.621
<v Speaker 5>Like if,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if,</v>

2314
01:45:43.621 --> 01:45:46.100
<v Speaker 5>if they all agree,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and this was one of the things that</v>

2315
01:45:46.101 --> 01:45:49.790
<v Speaker 5>James Damore pointed out about Google,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like they don't leave any room</v>

2316
01:45:49.791 --> 01:45:52.850
<v Speaker 5>whatsoever for conservatives.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like they absolutely discriminate</v>

2317
01:45:52.851 --> 01:45:55.160
<v Speaker 5>against conservatives.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not conservative,</v>

2318
01:45:55.610 --> 01:45:58.670
<v Speaker 5>but if I was and I worked at a company</v>
<v Speaker 5>like Google,</v>

2319
01:45:58.680 --> 01:46:01.550
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Imagine how fucking on the outside you</v>

2320
01:46:01.551 --> 01:46:04.190
<v Speaker 5>would feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is it illegal to be conservative?</v>

2321
01:46:04.280 --> 01:46:08.270
<v Speaker 5>Like isn't there a responsible ethical</v>
<v Speaker 5>form of conservatism that's not racist?</v>

2322
01:46:08.271 --> 01:46:09.580
<v Speaker 5>Not Homophobic,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>

2323
01:46:09.820 --> 01:46:14.300
<v Speaker 5>but presumes that a conservative person</v>
<v Speaker 5>in power would be more fiscally</v>

2324
01:46:14.301 --> 01:46:16.940
<v Speaker 5>responsible,</v>
<v Speaker 5>will have economic policies that they</v>

2325
01:46:16.941 --> 01:46:19.790
<v Speaker 5>agree with interventionist policies they</v>
<v Speaker 5>agree with.</v>

2326
01:46:19.880 --> 01:46:21.830
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think that that's outside the</v>

2327
01:46:21.831 --> 01:46:25.460
<v Speaker 5>realm of possibility that a reasonable</v>
<v Speaker 5>person could be conservative.</v>

2328
01:46:25.610 --> 01:46:30.610
<v Speaker 5>But if you work for any big tech company</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's not in the menu,</v>

2329
01:46:31.160 --> 01:46:34.370
<v Speaker 5>you don't get to be that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like you don't get to promote that.</v>

2330
01:46:34.371 --> 01:46:36.650
<v Speaker 5>You don't get to agree with that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's weird.</v>

2331
01:46:37.430 --> 01:46:40.370
<v Speaker 5>It's not good because it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not open speech.</v>

2332
01:46:41.090 --> 01:46:42.770
<v Speaker 5>You're supposed to be able to talk shit</v>
<v Speaker 5>through.</v>

2333
01:46:42.800 --> 01:46:45.650
<v Speaker 5>I'm a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I like to listen to someone who has a</v>

2334
01:46:45.651 --> 01:46:48.260
<v Speaker 5>very strong opinion about something and</v>
<v Speaker 5>see if it resonates with me.</v>

2335
01:46:48.470 --> 01:46:49.800
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you stop the stop,</v>

2336
01:46:49.801 --> 01:46:52.340
<v Speaker 5>that'll stifle that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was just going to demonetizing</v>

2337
01:46:52.341 --> 01:46:54.330
<v Speaker 5>monetizing a video though isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2338
01:46:54.630 --> 01:46:55.830
<v Speaker 5>censoring someone.</v>

2339
01:46:55.860 --> 01:46:57.780
<v Speaker 5>It's encouraging censorship.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is why,</v>

2340
01:46:57.781 --> 01:47:01.320
<v Speaker 5>because you don't want to be demonetized</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you have a video in that video can</v>

2341
01:47:01.321 --> 01:47:03.720
<v Speaker 5>make you $500.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If it's,</v>

2342
01:47:03.721 --> 01:47:06.270
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if it's up and it gets ads or it can</v>

2343
01:47:06.271 --> 01:47:08.250
<v Speaker 5>make you $0 million,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that's,</v>

2344
01:47:08.280 --> 01:47:11.910
<v Speaker 5>that's a $500 incentive for you to not</v>
<v Speaker 5>talk about whatever the fuck got it.</v>

2345
01:47:11.911 --> 01:47:13.260
<v Speaker 5>Demonetized right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But that's,</v>

2346
01:47:13.460 --> 01:47:15.150
<v Speaker 5>that then makes your argument,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

2347
01:47:15.151 --> 01:47:17.340
<v Speaker 5>what were you making the content for in</v>
<v Speaker 5>the first place?</v>

2348
01:47:17.400 --> 01:47:18.620
<v Speaker 5>Or you just make it doesn't to me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2349
01:47:18.630 --> 01:47:18.991
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

2350
01:47:18.991 --> 01:47:19.321
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

2351
01:47:19.321 --> 01:47:19.651
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

2352
01:47:19.651 --> 01:47:19.951
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

2353
01:47:19.951 --> 01:47:22.980
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a motivation for you to censor your</v>

2354
01:47:22.981 --> 01:47:25.260
<v Speaker 5>speech,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever you're making it for in the</v>

2355
01:47:25.261 --> 01:47:28.080
<v Speaker 5>first place.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You presume that someone was just making</v>

2356
01:47:28.081 --> 01:47:31.530
<v Speaker 5>it to make it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there's an absolute monetary value</v>

2357
01:47:31.560 --> 01:47:35.700
<v Speaker 5>if they put ads on it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So if they take away the monetary value</v>

2358
01:47:36.150 --> 01:47:39.810
<v Speaker 5>and they do it specifically because you</v>
<v Speaker 5>chose a certain subject that is in fact</v>

2359
01:47:39.811 --> 01:47:43.230
<v Speaker 5>a form of censorship there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>where they're doing is encouraging you</v>

2360
01:47:43.231 --> 01:47:45.450
<v Speaker 5>to self censor in order to make more</v>
<v Speaker 5>money.</v>

2361
01:47:45.540 --> 01:47:46.373
<v Speaker 5>They can say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

2362
01:47:46.430 --> 01:47:49.920
<v Speaker 5>you can do whatever the fuck you want.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're going to decide that if you talk</v>

2363
01:47:49.921 --> 01:47:53.280
<v Speaker 5>about fill in the blank,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that subject no money,</v>

2364
01:47:53.910 --> 01:47:55.230
<v Speaker 5>so don't talk about that subject</v>
<v Speaker 5>anymore.</v>

2365
01:47:55.260 --> 01:47:57.780
<v Speaker 5>They're not going to give you money</v>
<v Speaker 5>because they're sharing that money with</v>

2366
01:47:57.781 --> 01:47:59.970
<v Speaker 5>you though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You could still share that video on your</v>

2367
01:47:59.971 --> 01:48:02.820
<v Speaker 5>twitter channel.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You could still share it on your blog</v>

2368
01:48:03.240 --> 01:48:05.380
<v Speaker 5>and still make money if you can find her</v>
<v Speaker 5>on advertisers.</v>

2369
01:48:05.381 --> 01:48:06.540
<v Speaker 5>There's just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they see what you're doing.</v>

2370
01:48:06.570 --> 01:48:08.460
<v Speaker 5>I see what you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's not a good argument.</v>

2371
01:48:08.580 --> 01:48:10.950
<v Speaker 5>The reason why it's not a good argument</v>
<v Speaker 5>is because they made a concerted</v>

2372
01:48:10.951 --> 01:48:13.710
<v Speaker 5>decision.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They made a very clear decision to take</v>

2373
01:48:13.711 --> 01:48:16.500
<v Speaker 5>away the ads on videos where they don't</v>
<v Speaker 5>like what you're saying.</v>

2374
01:48:16.680 --> 01:48:19.590
<v Speaker 5>That just could be because they don't</v>
<v Speaker 5>have advertisers that are willing to pay</v>

2375
01:48:19.591 --> 01:48:21.630
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's all.</v>

2376
01:48:21.630 --> 01:48:24.350
<v Speaker 5>That's the way I would look at it that</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've advertised.</v>

2377
01:48:24.360 --> 01:48:28.140
<v Speaker 5>W didn't willing to pay that because of</v>
<v Speaker 5>like Douglas Murray and Sam Harris</v>

2378
01:48:28.141 --> 01:48:28.891
<v Speaker 5>talking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They just couldn't,</v>

2379
01:48:28.891 --> 01:48:30.810
<v Speaker 5>maybe they couldn't find the money for</v>
<v Speaker 5>it and they're like,</v>

2380
01:48:30.811 --> 01:48:32.770
<v Speaker 5>I guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 5>This does not monetize.</v>

2381
01:48:32.800 --> 01:48:33.571
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't know.</v>

2382
01:48:33.571 --> 01:48:36.570
<v Speaker 5>There's this weird making a guess</v>
<v Speaker 5>because you're doing this to try to</v>

2383
01:48:36.571 --> 01:48:38.370
<v Speaker 5>reinforce your original opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't.</v>

2384
01:48:38.380 --> 01:48:40.710
<v Speaker 5>I don't think it is censorship.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a form of censorship.</v>

2385
01:48:41.070 --> 01:48:44.790
<v Speaker 5>I think that the monetizing is not a</v>
<v Speaker 5>good thing because of other ways,</v>

2386
01:48:44.850 --> 01:48:47.970
<v Speaker 5>other reasons that it happens.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm on youtube because they then have an</v>

2387
01:48:47.971 --> 01:48:51.240
<v Speaker 5>incentive to share monetize videos</v>
<v Speaker 5>because they're making money on them.</v>

2388
01:48:51.780 --> 01:48:54.600
<v Speaker 5>I get that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's just because it's democratized.</v>

2389
01:48:54.680 --> 01:48:57.660
<v Speaker 5>Understand that you too,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who has a youtube has an incentive to</v>

2390
01:48:57.661 --> 01:49:00.480
<v Speaker 5>share monetize videos because they're</v>
<v Speaker 5>sharing in the profit of every single</v>

2391
01:49:00.481 --> 01:49:03.260
<v Speaker 5>video monetize video doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2392
01:49:03.300 --> 01:49:05.880
<v Speaker 5>critters that get 100% of the money,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they get half of the money.</v>

2393
01:49:05.940 --> 01:49:07.350
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Youtube gets the other half.</v>

2394
01:49:08.040 --> 01:49:09.970
<v Speaker 5>So if a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if a video is monetized as theirs,</v>

2395
01:49:10.390 --> 01:49:12.300
<v Speaker 5>they've been a fitness sharing them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right,</v>

2396
01:49:12.330 --> 01:49:13.080
<v Speaker 5>right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

2397
01:49:13.080 --> 01:49:16.230
<v Speaker 5>So that even reinforces more the idea</v>
<v Speaker 5>that they're censoring.</v>

2398
01:49:16.290 --> 01:49:17.071
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's what I'm saying.</v>

2399
01:49:17.071 --> 01:49:19.950
<v Speaker 5>But like the third,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're censoring the ability for it to</v>

2400
01:49:19.951 --> 01:49:21.990
<v Speaker 5>share it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to be shared in the youtube platform,</v>

2401
01:49:22.050 --> 01:49:24.540
<v Speaker 5>not on the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's true as a whole,</v>

2402
01:49:24.570 --> 01:49:29.570
<v Speaker 5>but they're not censoring what they're</v>
<v Speaker 5>doing is promoting self censorship by</v>

2403
01:49:30.901 --> 01:49:35.010
<v Speaker 5>giving you a fiscal reward for following</v>
<v Speaker 5>their line.</v>

2404
01:49:35.520 --> 01:49:37.170
<v Speaker 5>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's just where I'm saying like as a</v>

2405
01:49:37.171 --> 01:49:39.930
<v Speaker 5>creator,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you're making content to just make</v>

2406
01:49:39.931 --> 01:49:42.690
<v Speaker 5>money on youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then you have to play by their rules.</v>

2407
01:49:43.050 --> 01:49:45.450
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I understand what you're saying,</v>

2408
01:49:45.630 --> 01:49:50.630
<v Speaker 5>but what my point about this is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is what they're doing is they're there,</v>

2409
01:49:52.031 --> 01:49:54.880
<v Speaker 5>they're making their own,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're making these decisions.</v>

2410
01:49:54.881 --> 01:49:57.310
<v Speaker 5>And who is making these decisions that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

2411
01:49:57.490 --> 01:50:01.330
<v Speaker 5>that also could be definitely said they</v>
<v Speaker 5>should say these are the rules,</v>

2412
01:50:01.390 --> 01:50:01.570
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2413
01:50:01.570 --> 01:50:04.270
<v Speaker 5>I'm the person responsible for making</v>
<v Speaker 5>that statement.</v>

2414
01:50:04.330 --> 01:50:06.070
<v Speaker 5>What are the rules?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Here's they don't say,</v>

2415
01:50:06.071 --> 01:50:08.590
<v Speaker 5>they don't say this is what's weird</v>
<v Speaker 5>about it.</v>

2416
01:50:08.620 --> 01:50:12.670
<v Speaker 5>It's totally arbitrary.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's no like written law that you</v>

2417
01:50:12.671 --> 01:50:14.500
<v Speaker 5>have to follow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's no like,</v>

2418
01:50:14.530 --> 01:50:15.820
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can't say cunt.</v>

2419
01:50:16.030 --> 01:50:18.310
<v Speaker 5>Because if you say con,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know playtex doesn't want to</v>

2420
01:50:18.311 --> 01:50:20.290
<v Speaker 5>advertise in your fucking video anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2421
01:50:20.520 --> 01:50:21.670
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's not that.</v>

2422
01:50:22.120 --> 01:50:24.070
<v Speaker 5>It's weird that they don't tell you what</v>
<v Speaker 5>to do.</v>

2423
01:50:24.071 --> 01:50:27.730
<v Speaker 5>Monetize video is like when we get one,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they don't say it's because you guys</v>

2424
01:50:28.480 --> 01:50:29.880
<v Speaker 5>talked about about youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2425
01:50:29.920 --> 01:50:30.820
<v Speaker 5>they don't say shit.</v>

2426
01:50:31.270 --> 01:50:32.620
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's fucking weird,</v>

2427
01:50:32.621 --> 01:50:34.660
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Never fucked with me in eight years.</v>

2428
01:50:34.720 --> 01:50:36.850
<v Speaker 3>Youtube fucks with me every day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2429
01:50:36.851 --> 01:50:37.450
<v Speaker 3>But the thing about</v>

2430
01:50:37.450 --> 01:50:41.020
<v Speaker 5>Vimeo is the difference in the numbers</v>
<v Speaker 5>is so radical.</v>

2431
01:50:41.170 --> 01:50:42.820
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if we have a video that gets a million</v>

2432
01:50:42.821 --> 01:50:45.430
<v Speaker 5>hits on Youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it'll get 20,000 on vimeo.</v>

2433
01:50:45.450 --> 01:50:46.283
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

2434
01:50:46.420 --> 01:50:49.810
<v Speaker 3>Like I've been using vimeo live lately.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

2435
01:50:49.811 --> 01:50:52.840
<v Speaker 3>if you have youtube liar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you look at the chat room in Youtube,</v>

2436
01:50:53.290 --> 01:50:57.640
<v Speaker 3>90% just negative,</v>
<v Speaker 3>angry horseshit vimeo community.</v>

2437
01:50:57.720 --> 01:51:00.970
<v Speaker 3>Like I think we had like 400 people last</v>
<v Speaker 3>night watching killed Tony.</v>

2438
01:51:01.570 --> 01:51:03.190
<v Speaker 3>Everyone was positive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just nice,</v>

2439
01:51:03.191 --> 01:51:05.050
<v Speaker 3>happy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no negative trolling,</v>

2440
01:51:05.230 --> 01:51:07.590
<v Speaker 3>which is like a different popular yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2441
01:51:07.720 --> 01:51:12.550
<v Speaker 3>but it was a different environment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Guess that's why they don't get like</v>

2442
01:51:12.551 --> 01:51:15.460
<v Speaker 3>youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't have things like ip bands.</v>

2443
01:51:15.461 --> 01:51:17.080
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you get banned on Youtube,</v>

2444
01:51:17.340 --> 01:51:19.510
<v Speaker 3>you just get a new gene,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gmail address and now you have a new</v>

2445
01:51:19.511 --> 01:51:22.990
<v Speaker 3>fucking thing where like other places</v>
<v Speaker 3>like vimeo and stuff like that,</v>

2446
01:51:22.991 --> 01:51:24.910
<v Speaker 3>you get banned.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're pretty much band band.</v>

2447
01:51:24.911 --> 01:51:25.960
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how it should be.</v>

2448
01:51:25.961 --> 01:51:26.794
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2449
01:51:27.700 --> 01:51:30.400
<v Speaker 3>Damn fault.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who should be deciding if you get</v>

2450
01:51:30.401 --> 01:51:31.090
<v Speaker 3>banned,</v>
<v Speaker 3>banned,</v>

2451
01:51:31.090 --> 01:51:33.940
<v Speaker 3>that's going to be an ip band that like</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone was at your house and now you're</v>

2452
01:51:33.941 --> 01:51:37.360
<v Speaker 3>banned from using youtube because</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone was over or a neighbor is using</v>

2453
01:51:37.361 --> 01:51:40.360
<v Speaker 3>your wifi and they fucked you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's also your responsibility to know</v>

2454
01:51:40.361 --> 01:51:41.970
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess it'd be mb.</v>

2455
01:51:42.180 --> 01:51:43.600
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's like looking at Kiddie</v>
<v Speaker 3>porn.</v>

2456
01:51:43.601 --> 01:51:45.280
<v Speaker 3>Like go to your friend's house and look</v>
<v Speaker 3>at Kitty Porn.</v>

2457
01:51:45.540 --> 01:51:46.780
<v Speaker 3>You'd get arrested,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2458
01:51:46.781 --> 01:51:50.230
<v Speaker 3>cause it's your ip address.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or if you go over a friends house and</v>

2459
01:51:50.231 --> 01:51:52.540
<v Speaker 3>watch his Kiddie Porn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did you get arrested?</v>

2460
01:51:53.080 --> 01:51:55.240
<v Speaker 3>If you do it in a car,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not supposed to watch it.</v>

2461
01:51:55.241 --> 01:51:57.700
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are you like to listen to it?</v>

2462
01:51:58.290 --> 01:52:00.870
<v Speaker 5>That's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2463
01:52:00.880 --> 01:52:01.870
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2464
01:52:01.871 --> 01:52:04.510
<v Speaker 5>I bet you're not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2465
01:52:04.511 --> 01:52:07.990
<v Speaker 5>but that's one of those things where we</v>
<v Speaker 5>decide that people shouldn't have that</v>

2466
01:52:07.991 --> 01:52:09.940
<v Speaker 5>in their life,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

2467
01:52:10.420 --> 01:52:14.860
<v Speaker 5>But here's the question.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What are they going to do when they have</v>

2468
01:52:15.010 --> 01:52:20.010
<v Speaker 5>CGI</v>
<v Speaker 5>that they can program to have very</v>

2469
01:52:20.770 --> 01:52:25.770
<v Speaker 5>realistic looking pedophile porn,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there's no human being involved.</v>

2470
01:52:26.870 --> 01:52:29.990
<v Speaker 3>Then it was kind of like those dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You saw those dollars as pd dolls,</v>

2471
01:52:30.250 --> 01:52:31.540
<v Speaker 3>pedophile dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you,</v>

2472
01:52:31.740 --> 01:52:33.800
<v Speaker 3>what do you think about those?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you think there should be the sex</v>

2473
01:52:33.801 --> 01:52:36.600
<v Speaker 3>doll kid sect stalls?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know about that.</v>

2474
01:52:37.080 --> 01:52:41.310
<v Speaker 5>Disney's latest research project can</v>
<v Speaker 5>turn scripts into virtual reality.</v>

2475
01:52:41.340 --> 01:52:43.920
<v Speaker 5>What does that something new that it's</v>
<v Speaker 5>definitely not out yet,</v>

2476
01:52:43.921 --> 01:52:46.070
<v Speaker 5>but they're just showed this that they</v>
<v Speaker 5>can turn</v>

2477
01:52:46.070 --> 01:52:51.070
<v Speaker 6>written scripts into very crude CGI</v>
<v Speaker 6>virtual reality experiences.</v>

2478
01:52:51.380 --> 01:52:52.940
<v Speaker 6>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2479
01:52:53.240 --> 01:52:57.020
<v Speaker 6>so this is just the early version of it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This might take off if they decide to</v>

2480
01:52:57.021 --> 01:52:59.600
<v Speaker 6>continue to push money into it and</v>
<v Speaker 6>figure it out.</v>

2481
01:53:00.080 --> 01:53:03.350
<v Speaker 5>Get deciphered by the commuter computer,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which creates images.</v>

2482
01:53:03.810 --> 01:53:06.060
<v Speaker 6>I believe so.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was trying to read it to understand</v>

2483
01:53:06.061 --> 01:53:07.620
<v Speaker 6>it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's sort of what they're saying.</v>

2484
01:53:08.860 --> 01:53:10.880
<v Speaker 5>That's sweet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's so crazy.</v>

2485
01:53:11.120 --> 01:53:12.530
<v Speaker 5>That's a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that's inevitable.</v>

2486
01:53:12.710 --> 01:53:15.800
<v Speaker 5>This is probably going to be like the</v>
<v Speaker 5>upper level CGI,</v>

2487
01:53:16.010 --> 01:53:17.570
<v Speaker 5>like you're going to be able to write</v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

2488
01:53:17.750 --> 01:53:20.870
<v Speaker 5>Then you're going to be able to talk</v>
<v Speaker 5>into it and it's going to create things.</v>

2489
01:53:21.080 --> 01:53:24.350
<v Speaker 5>You're going to have a fucking headset</v>
<v Speaker 5>on and you're going to be in a room and</v>

2490
01:53:24.351 --> 01:53:28.340
<v Speaker 5>you're going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want to be in the Avatar world and</v>

2491
01:53:28.341 --> 01:53:32.150
<v Speaker 5>ride a dragon and I want to be blue and</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want to have a bow and Arrow and I</v>

2492
01:53:32.151 --> 01:53:34.580
<v Speaker 5>want to go to the tree of life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And all that shit is going to be right</v>

2493
01:53:34.581 --> 01:53:36.480
<v Speaker 5>in front of you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2494
01:53:36.530 --> 01:53:38.990
<v Speaker 5>They're going to just to be able to do</v>
<v Speaker 5>it with virtual reality based on your</v>

2495
01:53:38.991 --> 01:53:41.780
<v Speaker 5>suggestions and then they're gonna</v>
<v Speaker 5>figure out a way to get your brain to</v>

2496
01:53:41.781 --> 01:53:43.100
<v Speaker 5>interface with that thing.</v>

2497
01:53:43.700 --> 01:53:46.070
<v Speaker 5>Whereas they've already figured out a</v>
<v Speaker 5>way to get a kid to move his car.</v>

2498
01:53:46.100 --> 01:53:49.640
<v Speaker 5>Someone was paralyzed and they got this</v>
<v Speaker 5>person to move their cursor.</v>

2499
01:53:49.670 --> 01:53:51.380
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if it was a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2500
01:53:51.590 --> 01:53:54.050
<v Speaker 5>they've,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they've had a bunch of different things</v>

2501
01:53:54.051 --> 01:53:56.330
<v Speaker 5>where they've used the mind to control</v>
<v Speaker 5>things.</v>

2502
01:53:56.570 --> 01:53:59.780
<v Speaker 5>I did a thing on Joe Rogan questions,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everything where I put this headset on</v>

2503
01:54:00.080 --> 01:54:01.220
<v Speaker 5>and I got,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2504
01:54:02.050 --> 01:54:02.790
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a,</v>

2505
01:54:02.790 --> 01:54:06.410
<v Speaker 5>a drone to listen to me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I could get it to lift up off the ground</v>

2506

2551
01:55:53.170 --> 01:55:55.090
<v Speaker 5>Like everything's not going so well.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

2552
01:55:55.091 --> 01:55:57.910
<v Speaker 5>I was just in Fresno the other day and</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2553
01:55:58.360 --> 01:56:00.240
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when we were drought,</v>

2554
01:56:00.250 --> 01:56:02.950
<v Speaker 5>Tony and I did a gig up there and when</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're driving around the town,</v>

2555
01:56:03.370 --> 01:56:06.220
<v Speaker 5>there's streets filled with homeless</v>
<v Speaker 5>people,</v>

2556
01:56:06.520 --> 01:56:08.830
<v Speaker 5>homeless,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like encampments everywhere.</v>

2557
01:56:09.610 --> 01:56:12.250
<v Speaker 5>I mean there's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's people that just are in a bad</v>

2558
01:56:12.251 --> 01:56:16.060
<v Speaker 5>place and they can't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not going to get any better where</v>

2559
01:56:16.061 --> 01:56:19.230
<v Speaker 5>they live.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If someone comes along and introduces</v>

2560
01:56:19.260 --> 01:56:21.670
<v Speaker 5>something and it's just like a cell</v>
<v Speaker 5>phone,</v>

2561
01:56:21.700 --> 01:56:25.780
<v Speaker 5>everybody has it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you all lock into that thing.</v>

2562
01:56:26.290 --> 01:56:27.280
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Columbus,</v>

2563
01:56:27.281 --> 01:56:29.660
<v Speaker 5>Ohio to 20,</v>
<v Speaker 5>45 is that we did it.</v>

2564
01:56:29.690 --> 01:56:33.140
<v Speaker 5>This is what it's like homeless people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all the streets put this headset on and</v>

2565
01:56:33.460 --> 01:56:34.840
<v Speaker 5>in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2566
01:56:36.150 --> 01:56:37.560
<v Speaker 3>The real cool thing I think about the</v>
<v Speaker 3>movie,</v>

2567
01:56:37.561 --> 01:56:39.480
<v Speaker 3>which is the plot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which isn't giveaway much cause I</v>

2568
01:56:39.481 --> 01:56:40.680
<v Speaker 3>haven't read the book.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I don't know.</v>

2569
01:56:40.740 --> 01:56:43.920
<v Speaker 3>It sounds like something that could</v>
<v Speaker 3>happen soon is that there's like a bug</v>

2570
01:56:44.070 --> 01:56:47.640
<v Speaker 3>in the game and there's a prize for it</v>
<v Speaker 3>that everyone's going after the bug</v>

2571
01:56:47.641 --> 01:56:50.600
<v Speaker 3>price ever confined.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It gets on like Willy Wonka style.</v>

2572
01:56:50.601 --> 01:56:51.420
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could do the thing.</v>

2573
01:56:51.420 --> 01:56:54.270
<v Speaker 3>And what's really interesting is that</v>
<v Speaker 3>the movie also has,</v>

2574
01:56:54.360 --> 01:56:57.330
<v Speaker 3>cause you pick an Avatar just like a</v>
<v Speaker 3>video game or facebook.</v>

2575
01:56:57.420 --> 01:57:01.050
<v Speaker 3>So people are picking like I went to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>King Kong kongs in,</v>

2576
01:57:01.051 --> 01:57:04.910
<v Speaker 3>in like back to the future cars in it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the cure is motorcycles in it and you</v>

2577
01:57:04.920 --> 01:57:07.740
<v Speaker 3>know the iron giant Senate and oh Freddy</v>
<v Speaker 3>Krueger's in it.</v>

2578
01:57:07.950 --> 01:57:08.461
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2579
01:57:08.461 --> 01:57:09.360
<v Speaker 3>so they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've,</v>

2580
01:57:09.810 --> 01:57:12.420
<v Speaker 3>they got to use a lot of different</v>
<v Speaker 3>franchise.</v>

2581
01:57:12.421 --> 01:57:15.420
<v Speaker 3>There's a speed racer car back to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>future.</v>

2582
01:57:15.480 --> 01:57:16.320
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's,</v>

2583
01:57:16.321 --> 01:57:18.180
<v Speaker 5>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is all inevitable.</v>

2584
01:57:18.330 --> 01:57:22.710
<v Speaker 5>I mean if they're going to continue the</v>
<v Speaker 5>same path that they're on now,</v>

2585
01:57:23.040 --> 01:57:25.650
<v Speaker 5>if you go back and look at the video</v>
<v Speaker 5>games that we used to see when we were</v>

2586
01:57:25.651 --> 01:57:28.830
<v Speaker 5>kids,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like can you play mortal Kombat on a</v>

2587
01:57:28.831 --> 01:57:30.540
<v Speaker 5>console?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was kind of cool.</v>

2588
01:57:30.570 --> 01:57:32.280
<v Speaker 5>But the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>compared to this,</v>

2589
01:57:32.460 --> 01:57:33.720
<v Speaker 5>it's like Pong,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2590
01:57:33.750 --> 01:57:35.910
<v Speaker 5>And it's going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just going to keep going.</v>

2591
01:57:36.270 --> 01:57:38.880
<v Speaker 5>It's just a matter of where,</v>
<v Speaker 5>where it's going to leave us.</v>

2592
01:57:39.240 --> 01:57:41.190
<v Speaker 5>Like what are,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're not going to be people anymore</v>

2593
01:57:41.191 --> 01:57:43.680
<v Speaker 5>real soon.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cause in a hundred years we're not going</v>

2594
01:57:43.681 --> 01:57:45.810
<v Speaker 5>to be people anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're going to be some weird new thing.</v>

2595
01:57:48.300 --> 01:57:50.280
<v Speaker 5>Do you think we'll be here?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think so.</v>

2596
01:57:50.550 --> 01:57:51.690
<v Speaker 5>We'll be dead.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

2597
01:57:51.780 --> 01:57:54.990
<v Speaker 5>but like that thing that's on the bottom</v>
<v Speaker 5>of the ocean that they found that</v>

2598
01:57:54.991 --> 01:57:56.640
<v Speaker 5>dinosaur thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're going to be like one of those</v>

2599
01:57:56.641 --> 01:57:57.840
<v Speaker 5>things like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh Jesus,</v>

2600
01:57:58.170 --> 01:58:01.140
<v Speaker 5>like that thing like it's crazy because</v>
<v Speaker 5>we know that they used to exist.</v>

2601
01:58:01.141 --> 01:58:02.520
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So if we find one today,</v>

2602
01:58:02.521 --> 01:58:03.480
<v Speaker 5>like wow,</v>
<v Speaker 5>nuts.</v>

2603
01:58:03.481 --> 01:58:05.640
<v Speaker 5>I think still here that's going to be</v>
<v Speaker 5>like people,</v>

2604
01:58:05.670 --> 01:58:08.640
<v Speaker 5>they find some dude who's living in the</v>
<v Speaker 5>mountains outside of Colorado is like</v>

2605
01:58:08.990 --> 01:58:12.210
<v Speaker 5>he'd catch his own fish.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's 116 years old and they finally</v>

2606
01:58:12.220 --> 01:58:13.290
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look at this guy.</v>

2607
01:58:13.410 --> 01:58:15.480
<v Speaker 5>He's got no electronics and it's all</v>
<v Speaker 5>body.</v>

2608
01:58:15.600 --> 01:58:18.420
<v Speaker 5>Do you think it'd be like Amish people</v>
<v Speaker 5>would still ask her that for instance,</v>

2609
01:58:18.440 --> 01:58:19.530
<v Speaker 5>or would be,</v>
<v Speaker 5>would that be them?</v>

2610
01:58:19.770 --> 01:58:21.430
<v Speaker 5>We'd kill those.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Eat them.</v>

2611
01:58:21.510 --> 01:58:24.040
<v Speaker 5>They would have to kill him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The robot people would have to kill the</v>

2612
01:58:24.080 --> 01:58:24.530
<v Speaker 5>moms.</v>

2613
01:58:24.530 --> 01:58:25.710
<v Speaker 5>We can't have him around.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They would,</v>

2614
01:58:25.711 --> 01:58:28.020
<v Speaker 5>they would think they would say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well are there like wildlife?</v>

2615
01:58:28.080 --> 01:58:31.980
<v Speaker 5>They like wildlife after a certain point</v>
<v Speaker 5>because if we all started out as some</v>

2616
01:58:31.981 --> 01:58:35.490
<v Speaker 5>sort of pro hominid back in the early</v>
<v Speaker 5>days of evolution,</v>

2617
01:58:35.491 --> 01:58:37.110
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>We started as some sort of primitive</v>

2618
01:58:37.111 --> 01:58:40.050
<v Speaker 5>primate and that eventually evolved to</v>
<v Speaker 5>be what we are now,</v>

2619
01:58:40.410 --> 01:58:42.970
<v Speaker 5>but there's still chimps around there</v>
<v Speaker 5>still monkeys around.</v>

2620
01:58:42.971 --> 01:58:47.800
<v Speaker 5>There's still a lot of primitive</v>
<v Speaker 5>primates like did they evolve at a later</v>

2621
01:58:47.801 --> 01:58:50.280
<v Speaker 5>date?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did they start later than us to dislike</v>

2622
01:58:50.290 --> 01:58:52.900
<v Speaker 5>that they get a different car call time</v>
<v Speaker 5>to the race,</v>

2623
01:58:53.320 --> 01:58:58.320
<v Speaker 5>like what happened or did some things</v>
<v Speaker 5>stay the same while other things change</v>

2624
01:58:58.600 --> 01:59:01.450
<v Speaker 5>and it's just the rate of change seem so</v>
<v Speaker 5>spectacularly quick,</v>

2625
01:59:01.570 --> 01:59:03.130
<v Speaker 5>but it's only because of our</v>
<v Speaker 5>perspective,</v>

2626
01:59:03.490 --> 01:59:08.410
<v Speaker 5>but really there could be groups of</v>
<v Speaker 5>people and might be the amish that stay</v>

2627
01:59:08.560 --> 01:59:13.560
<v Speaker 5>exactly the same and then the new beings</v>
<v Speaker 5>treat them like colobus monkeys in the</v>

2628
01:59:13.961 --> 01:59:15.160
<v Speaker 5>jungle or leg.</v>

2629
01:59:15.160 --> 01:59:19.020
<v Speaker 5>Some fucking weird giraffe that you see</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you go on a safari.</v>

2630
01:59:19.030 --> 01:59:19.511
<v Speaker 5>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

2631
01:59:19.511 --> 01:59:20.890
<v Speaker 5>look.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The people that make their own butter,</v>

2632
01:59:21.220 --> 01:59:22.810
<v Speaker 5>they're real,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're real,</v>

2633
01:59:22.930 --> 01:59:24.910
<v Speaker 5>and we'd wave at him,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hello,</v>

2634
01:59:25.390 --> 01:59:27.820
<v Speaker 5>I love your wagon.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2635
01:59:28.990 --> 01:59:32.860
<v Speaker 5>they could become wildlife.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They can become a very primitive form of</v>

2636
01:59:32.861 --> 01:59:35.110
<v Speaker 5>wildlife.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They could become like uncontacted</v>

2637
01:59:35.111 --> 01:59:37.570
<v Speaker 5>tribes in the Amazon where we just leave</v>
<v Speaker 5>them alone.</v>

2638
01:59:37.571 --> 01:59:39.040
<v Speaker 5>We think they're novel.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look,</v>

2639
01:59:39.041 --> 01:59:40.960
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're painted all read their whole</v>

2640
01:59:40.961 --> 01:59:43.000
<v Speaker 5>body.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They have a bow and arrow that they made</v>

2641
01:59:43.001 --> 01:59:45.550
<v Speaker 5>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is amazing.</v>

2642
01:59:45.730 --> 01:59:48.340
<v Speaker 5>We get all excited about it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's the same exact shit,</v>

2643
01:59:49.210 --> 01:59:53.170
<v Speaker 5>same exact shit to us like then when the</v>
<v Speaker 5>new things take over,</v>

2644
01:59:53.171 --> 01:59:55.480
<v Speaker 5>they just keep the amish.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They keep tribes,</v>

2645
01:59:55.481 --> 01:59:57.580
<v Speaker 5>people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they keep the weird shit that's not</v>

2646
01:59:57.581 --> 01:59:59.620
<v Speaker 5>going to fuck with them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Anything that doesn't know how to work</v>

2647
01:59:59.621 --> 02:00:01.990
<v Speaker 5>electricity,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all those people that are out there</v>

2648
02:00:01.991 --> 02:00:06.340
<v Speaker 5>living without electricity.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know like those Alaska,</v>

2649
02:00:06.341 --> 02:00:09.040
<v Speaker 5>the last frontier shows,</v>
<v Speaker 5>those people would have to all plead for</v>

2650
02:00:09.041 --> 02:00:10.570
<v Speaker 5>their life and would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

2651
02:00:10.571 --> 02:00:15.571
<v Speaker 5>I'm just here homogenous over just</v>
<v Speaker 5>taking care of cattle and I'm not</v>

2652
02:00:15.701 --> 02:00:18.510
<v Speaker 5>planning on getting any weapons and we</v>
<v Speaker 5>are.</v>

2653
02:00:18.520 --> 02:00:21.970
<v Speaker 5>We like a simple life and we're happy</v>
<v Speaker 5>for our robot overlords.</v>

2654
02:00:21.971 --> 02:00:25.080
<v Speaker 5>Congratulations on your victory and just</v>
<v Speaker 5>leave this up here.</v>

2655
02:00:25.970 --> 02:00:28.640
<v Speaker 1>Ha Ha,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck that.</v>

2656
02:00:28.641 --> 02:00:31.910
<v Speaker 1>Right</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was getting my eyes looked at,</v>

2657
02:00:31.940 --> 02:00:36.810
<v Speaker 1>the doctor said that how people's eyes</v>
<v Speaker 1>are a lot worse nowadays and we number.</v>

2658
02:00:36.830 --> 02:00:38.120
<v Speaker 1>When you're a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your mom was like,</v>

2659
02:00:38.210 --> 02:00:40.400
<v Speaker 1>don't sit so close to your team,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the the TV.</v>

2660
02:00:40.401 --> 02:00:44.180
<v Speaker 1>But now we're putting goggles in her</v>
<v Speaker 1>eyes like one inch from our eye.</v>

2661
02:00:44.510 --> 02:00:46.970
<v Speaker 1>What's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why are we doing that?</v>

2662
02:00:46.971 --> 02:00:49.400
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why does no one talked about ihealth?</v>

2663
02:00:49.690 --> 02:00:53.510
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause it seems like if my optician or</v>

2664
02:00:53.511 --> 02:00:56.780
<v Speaker 1>whatever she's called is telling me</v>
<v Speaker 1>about like how do you should get these</v>

02:00:56.781 --> 02:01:00.230
<v Speaker 1>blue blocker things now you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone's eyes are so stressed</v>

2666
02:01:00.231 --> 02:01:02.030
<v Speaker 1>nowadays.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's true.</v>

2667
02:01:02.090 --> 02:01:05.600
<v Speaker 1>I think guys are definitely stress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also that we're getting old.</v>

2672
02:01:15.470 --> 02:01:17.630
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I had a crack on my iphone.</v>

2673
02:01:17.631 --> 02:01:19.730
<v Speaker 1>I dropped my iphone and I looked at it.</v>

<v Speaker 1>He goes right in the lower right hand</v>

2679

02:01:26.061 --> 02:01:29.930

<v Speaker 1>He could see it from my hand,</v>

2682
02:01:30.140 --> 02:01:34.430
<v Speaker 1>like my hand over here and he's here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like fucking five feet away from</v>

<v Speaker 1>me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can see it.</v>

02:01:34.851 --> 02:01:37.310
<v Speaker 1>I got this fucker inches from my face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't see it.</v>

2685
02:01:37.400 --> 02:01:41.540
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's been three years since I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my eyes checked and I used to always be</v>

2686
02:01:41.541 --> 02:01:43.730
<v Speaker 1>perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was the first time where that</v>

2687
02:01:43.731 --> 02:01:45.050
<v Speaker 1>bottom row,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

2688
02:01:45.070 --> 02:01:47.610
<v Speaker 1>it's an eight or a zero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that an eight or does he wrong?</v>

2689
02:01:48.290 --> 02:01:49.880
<v Speaker 1>You get a menu in a restaurant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

2690
02:01:49.910 --> 02:01:51.320
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to have to start a fire and I</v>

2691
02:01:51.321 --> 02:01:54.130
<v Speaker 1>see this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to have to bust out a little</v>

2692
02:01:54.131 --> 02:01:55.550
<v Speaker 1>wider.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like a fucking concert.</v>

2693
02:01:55.730 --> 02:01:56.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or use the,</v>

2694
02:01:56.720 --> 02:01:58.940
<v Speaker 1>the gets super obnoxious if you use your</v>
<v Speaker 1>phone,</v>

2695
02:01:59.090 --> 02:02:02.920
<v Speaker 1>that light on your phone or there's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>magnifying app on the phone now it's</v>

2696
02:02:02.960 --> 02:02:04.180
<v Speaker 1>like zooms in a little seat.</v>

2697
02:02:04.760 --> 02:02:05.630
<v Speaker 2>Dark.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My,</v>

2698
02:02:05.820 --> 02:02:08.780
<v Speaker 2>my low light sensitivities way</v>
<v Speaker 2>different.</v>

2699
02:02:09.280 --> 02:02:10.870
<v Speaker 2>I'm just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's probably because my,</v>

2700
02:02:10.900 --> 02:02:14.360
<v Speaker 2>my brain is overwhelmed by brightness</v>
<v Speaker 2>too much.</v>

2701
02:02:14.380 --> 02:02:16.820
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like staring at a computer screen.</v>

2702
02:02:17.390 --> 02:02:19.790
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the things that I like</v>
<v Speaker 2>about that right room app.</v>

2703
02:02:20.090 --> 02:02:21.710
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to sneeze.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unfortunately.</v>

2704
02:02:23.350 --> 02:02:26.830
<v Speaker 1>That right room APP gives you a dark</v>
<v Speaker 1>black screen with green lighting,</v>

2705
02:02:27.010 --> 02:02:28.590
<v Speaker 1>green writing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess it's a sweat.</v>

2706
02:02:28.600 --> 02:02:30.760
<v Speaker 1>These glasses do they block the blue</v>
<v Speaker 1>light?</v>

2707
02:02:30.761 --> 02:02:32.910
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of like night mode on your Mac</v>
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>

2708
02:02:33.250 --> 02:02:35.070
<v Speaker 1>or your phone where it turns yellow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2709
02:02:35.071 --> 02:02:37.150
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that supposedly way better on your</v>

2710
02:02:37.151 --> 02:02:38.260
<v Speaker 1>eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure it's better,</v>

2711
02:02:38.261 --> 02:02:39.640
<v Speaker 1>but we're still falling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hameroff fucked.</v>

2712
02:02:39.700 --> 02:02:41.560
<v Speaker 1>We're going down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going down.</v>

2713
02:02:41.590 --> 02:02:43.390
<v Speaker 1>They're gonna replace her eyes with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lots of can't wait.</v>

2714
02:02:43.750 --> 02:02:44.950
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's these drops.</v>

2715
02:02:44.951 --> 02:02:46.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have seen some news.</v>

2716
02:02:46.360 --> 02:02:48.910
<v Speaker 1>New eyedrops they think they're gonna be</v>
<v Speaker 1>able to put in your eye and you never</v>

2717
02:02:48.911 --> 02:02:51.700
<v Speaker 1>have to wear glasses again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do they do though?</v>

2718
02:02:51.730 --> 02:02:53.840
<v Speaker 1>Is it a genetic thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nanoparticles.</v>

2719
02:02:54.150 --> 02:02:57.010
<v Speaker 1>So fucking Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how they're going to get in to</v>

2720
02:02:57.011 --> 02:03:02.011
<v Speaker 1>getting in through your eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how's it explained how it works prior</v>

2721
02:03:02.680 --> 02:03:06.040
<v Speaker 1>to drop them in every couple of weeks or</v>
<v Speaker 1>every week or maybe even every day.</v>

2722
02:03:06.190 --> 02:03:08.620
<v Speaker 1>It's not for sure yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not even out yet.</v>

2723
02:03:08.621 --> 02:03:10.100
<v Speaker 1>Obviously you there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

2724
02:03:10.101 --> 02:03:11.020
<v Speaker 1>And just very new.</v>

2725
02:03:11.330 --> 02:03:13.400
<v Speaker 2>It works though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>

2726
02:03:14.240 --> 02:03:18.770
<v Speaker 2>Three step process performing the</v>
<v Speaker 2>smartphone or the measurement of the</v>

2727
02:03:18.771 --> 02:03:19.550
<v Speaker 2>eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your fraction.</v>

2728
02:03:19.550 --> 02:03:20.630
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

2729
02:03:20.690 --> 02:03:22.550
<v Speaker 2>And you'll just be able to drop it in</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

2730
02:03:23.300 --> 02:03:28.040
<v Speaker 2>Apply to the eye for less than one</v>
<v Speaker 2>second a laser though.</v>

2731
02:03:28.041 --> 02:03:32.660
<v Speaker 2>So then doctors create a very specific</v>
<v Speaker 2>laser pattern which is applied to the</v>

2732
02:03:32.661 --> 02:03:35.960
<v Speaker 2>eye for less than one second.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The laser creates tiny grooves in the</v>

2733
02:03:35.961 --> 02:03:39.260
<v Speaker 2>surface of the cornea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lastly,</v>

2734
02:03:39.261 --> 02:03:42.410
<v Speaker 2>special eyedrops or applied.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

2735
02:03:42.411 --> 02:03:44.990
<v Speaker 2>Like a good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they get a measurement of your IRA</v>

2736
02:03:44.991 --> 02:03:48.440
<v Speaker 2>fraction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which can then be performed with a smart</v>

2737
02:03:48.441 --> 02:03:49.640
<v Speaker 2>phone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

2738
02:03:49.670 --> 02:03:51.220
<v Speaker 2>That can be performed with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>smartphone.</v>

2739
02:03:51.230 --> 02:03:54.620
<v Speaker 2>The first part.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the doctors create the laser pattern</v>

2740
02:03:54.621 --> 02:03:58.270
<v Speaker 2>and then they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they fucking storm trooper your eyeball,</v>

2741
02:03:59.460 --> 02:04:02.750
<v Speaker 2>drop some chemicals on there and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>chemicals get in through the holes that</v>

2742
02:04:02.751 --> 02:04:07.160
<v Speaker 2>you've made in your eyeball.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What chicken?</v>

2743
02:04:07.160 --> 02:04:09.080
<v Speaker 2>The right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How amazing is that?</v>

2744
02:04:09.440 --> 02:04:12.580
<v Speaker 2>What does that works?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I've been,</v>

2745
02:04:12.650 --> 02:04:15.290
<v Speaker 2>I think that's going to happen with that</v>
<v Speaker 2>hearing will probably be get something</v>

2746
02:04:15.291 --> 02:04:17.420
<v Speaker 2>for that soon too because what if it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of those,</v>

2747
02:04:17.421 --> 02:04:20.750
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>artificial hip things like artificial</v>

2748
02:04:20.751 --> 02:04:22.520
<v Speaker 2>hip is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it does work.</v>

2749
02:04:22.670 --> 02:04:24.050
<v Speaker 2>But I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm always like,</v>

2750
02:04:24.051 --> 02:04:25.710
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like they're going to figure out</v>

2751
02:04:25.711 --> 02:04:28.190
<v Speaker 2>a better way right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like five years.</v>

2752
02:04:28.191 --> 02:04:31.880
<v Speaker 2>Like how long can you hang in there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like there it's so close to</v>

2753
02:04:31.881 --> 02:04:36.881
<v Speaker 2>regenerating tissue re,</v>
<v Speaker 2>re the regenerating all sorts of um,</v>

2754
02:04:37.060 --> 02:04:41.200
<v Speaker 2>cartilage and people and in certain</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that have had like a,</v>

2755
02:04:41.201 --> 02:04:44.750
<v Speaker 2>I know women had bladder cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they regenerated and an entire,</v>

2756
02:04:44.760 --> 02:04:47.550
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bladder for her made out of skin</v>

2757
02:04:47.551 --> 02:04:50.790
<v Speaker 2>tissue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They did this all with stem cells and</v>

2758
02:04:50.791 --> 02:04:53.970
<v Speaker 2>Mel Gibson's dad and that dude was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2759
02:04:54.060 --> 02:04:59.060
<v Speaker 2>his dad was 92 and he was like on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>door and it got shot up with stem cells</v>

2760
02:04:59.251 --> 02:05:01.140
<v Speaker 2>and now he's not even a wheelchair</v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>

2761
02:05:01.530 --> 02:05:02.161
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole story,</v>

2762
02:05:02.161 --> 02:05:04.650
<v Speaker 2>it was like what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like his hip was bothering him so bad.</v>

2763
02:05:04.860 --> 02:05:06.230
<v Speaker 2>He was in a wheelchair,</v>
<v Speaker 2>goes,</v>

2764
02:05:06.240 --> 02:05:08.820
<v Speaker 2>gets shot up with stem cells.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then all of a sudden he's walking</v>

2765
02:05:08.821 --> 02:05:09.654
<v Speaker 2>around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2766
02:05:10.530 --> 02:05:13.530
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This and this is like without being able</v>

2767
02:05:13.531 --> 02:05:17.760
<v Speaker 2>to be fully explored in the United</v>
<v Speaker 2>States like this is they have to go to</v>

2768
02:05:17.761 --> 02:05:20.190
<v Speaker 2>Panama to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're really weren't that guy.</v>

2769
02:05:20.191 --> 02:05:25.191
<v Speaker 2>Dr Neil Riordan is working to try to</v>
<v Speaker 2>bring it to Texas and if anybody would</v>

2770
02:05:25.230 --> 02:05:26.640
<v Speaker 2>be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't give a fuck,</v>

2771
02:05:26.641 --> 02:05:28.350
<v Speaker 2>let's do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would be Texas,</v>

2772
02:05:28.800 --> 02:05:31.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because this is all adult stem cells.</v>

2773
02:05:31.561 --> 02:05:34.000
<v Speaker 2>There's no issues with like fetal stem</v>
<v Speaker 2>cells.</v>

2774
02:05:34.001 --> 02:05:37.020
<v Speaker 2>So w religious people wouldn't get</v>
<v Speaker 2>involved in it and there's a lot of</v>

2775
02:05:37.021 --> 02:05:39.360
<v Speaker 2>folks that have like some serious</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking injuries.</v>

2776
02:05:39.400 --> 02:05:41.250
<v Speaker 2>This shit could really help.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hell yeah.</v>

2777
02:05:41.430 --> 02:05:43.890
<v Speaker 2>Even I heard that you could do things</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the mouth now.</v>

2778
02:05:43.890 --> 02:05:48.890
<v Speaker 2>Like teeth re Greek row a my gums and</v>
<v Speaker 2>teeth and you can pretty much do</v>

2779
02:05:49.321 --> 02:05:51.630
<v Speaker 2>anything now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe this Tim's house,</v>

2780
02:05:51.870 --> 02:05:55.590
<v Speaker 2>I think this is only one step.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think when,</v>

2781
02:05:55.591 --> 02:05:57.840
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're thinking back like 2030 years ago,</v>

2782
02:05:57.841 --> 02:06:00.300
<v Speaker 2>you never heard about this shit and now</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're hearing about it.</v>

2783
02:06:00.330 --> 02:06:02.160
<v Speaker 2>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How much better is it going to be in</v>

2784
02:06:02.161 --> 02:06:03.840
<v Speaker 2>2030 years from now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2785
02:06:03.841 --> 02:06:07.950
<v Speaker 2>how much of it it's going to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>nanoparticles mixed with stem cells and</v>

2786
02:06:07.951 --> 02:06:10.020
<v Speaker 2>they just fucking regenerate your whole</v>
<v Speaker 2>body.</v>

2787
02:06:10.590 --> 02:06:13.290
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's what's going to happen.</v>

2788
02:06:13.650 --> 02:06:16.650
<v Speaker 2>I think people are going to be able to</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just regenerate limbs,</v>

2789
02:06:16.860 --> 02:06:18.840
<v Speaker 2>but I think they're going to be able to</v>
<v Speaker 2>regrow your Bot.</v>

2790
02:06:18.841 --> 02:06:23.400
<v Speaker 2>Like refresh your body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like whatever your old bullshit ass</v>

2791
02:06:23.401 --> 02:06:25.950
<v Speaker 2>cells that you have in your body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to figure out where the</v>

2792
02:06:25.951 --> 02:06:29.430
<v Speaker 2>memories are actually stored.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's going to be,</v>

2793
02:06:29.620 --> 02:06:33.420
<v Speaker 2>that's going to be a trip if we find out</v>
<v Speaker 2>that memories are not just in your head,</v>

2794
02:06:33.421 --> 02:06:37.170
<v Speaker 2>but also in your body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like what if we completely redo the</v>

2795
02:06:37.171 --> 02:06:39.510
<v Speaker 2>body but keep the brain and you don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>remember shit.</v>

2796
02:06:42.630 --> 02:06:46.020
<v Speaker 2>If your brain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your brain is just a conduit for these</v>

2797
02:06:46.021 --> 02:06:49.740
<v Speaker 2>memories that are stored in your soul</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you've kind of replaced yourself</v>

2798
02:06:49.741 --> 02:06:54.741
<v Speaker 2>with some fake Zombie body with Nano</v>
<v Speaker 2>bots and the brain didn't remember shit.</v>

2799
02:06:55.740 --> 02:06:59.790
<v Speaker 2>Our shadows memories,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't make any sense.</v>

2800
02:07:00.780 --> 02:07:02.010
<v Speaker 2>They do think that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2801
02:07:02.190 --> 02:07:03.520
<v Speaker 2>the people have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2802
02:07:03.540 --> 02:07:08.540
<v Speaker 2>neurons in their heart that they might,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that this idea of like following your</v>

2803
02:07:08.881 --> 02:07:12.760
<v Speaker 2>heart and thinking with your heart</v>
<v Speaker 2>apparently is more neurons in the heart</v>

2804
02:07:12.761 --> 02:07:16.980
<v Speaker 2>and there on the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a true and gut and gut.</v>

2805
02:07:17.100 --> 02:07:18.810
<v Speaker 2>The heart and gut than there are on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>brain.</v>

2806
02:07:20.440 --> 02:07:22.340
<v Speaker 2>Nice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And my stomach was smarter than my head,</v>

2807
02:07:22.430 --> 02:07:23.590
<v Speaker 2>not brain cells.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that,</v>

2808
02:07:23.730 --> 02:07:27.060
<v Speaker 2>well that's no just neurons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that makes sense,</v>

2809
02:07:27.061 --> 02:07:28.990
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trust your gut like that.</v>

2810
02:07:29.090 --> 02:07:31.230
<v Speaker 2>You always heard that says trust your</v>
<v Speaker 2>heart.</v>

2811
02:07:31.500 --> 02:07:33.780
<v Speaker 2>40,000 neurons in the heart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

2812
02:07:33.870 --> 02:07:34.710
<v Speaker 2>How many is in the brain?</v>

2813
02:07:37.120 --> 02:07:39.040
<v Speaker 2>Trust your heart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trust your gut.</v>

2814
02:07:40.210 --> 02:07:43.810
<v Speaker 2>Trust your mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your mind is the only thing that</v>

2815
02:07:43.811 --> 02:07:47.740
<v Speaker 2>controls your perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Weird feeling about this.</v>

2816
02:07:47.980 --> 02:07:50.620
<v Speaker 2>Well that's the thing about eating</v>
<v Speaker 2>healthy food.</v>

2817
02:07:50.710 --> 02:07:54.340
<v Speaker 2>That's a big thing is that you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're changing the gut bacteria,</v>

2818
02:07:54.370 --> 02:07:57.670
<v Speaker 2>which literally changes who you are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to think about it that way.</v>

2819
02:07:58.060 --> 02:08:02.020
<v Speaker 2>Like it changes the person you are</v>
<v Speaker 2>because the person you are,</v>

2820
02:08:02.580 --> 02:08:04.300
<v Speaker 2>it's all those things have to be in</v>
<v Speaker 2>order.</v>

2821
02:08:04.301 --> 02:08:06.020
<v Speaker 2>Your head has to be in order.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2822
02:08:06.021 --> 02:08:09.910
<v Speaker 2>you have to like have the right amount</v>
<v Speaker 2>of certain healthy bacteria in your</v>

2823
02:08:09.911 --> 02:08:10.950
<v Speaker 2>system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise it doesn't.</v>

2824
02:08:11.010 --> 02:08:12.280
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not even you anymore.</v>

2825
02:08:12.450 --> 02:08:17.310
<v Speaker 2>It's just some crazy takeover of 10 DDA.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's quite,</v>

2826
02:08:17.350 --> 02:08:19.900
<v Speaker 2>according to the article,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just found about 40,000 and the heart,</v>

2827
02:08:20.140 --> 02:08:22.270
<v Speaker 2>100 million in the stomach.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

2828
02:08:22.271 --> 02:08:23.830
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>100 billion in your brain.</v>

2829
02:08:24.330 --> 02:08:25.570
<v Speaker 2>Why Lillian?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2830
02:08:25.571 --> 02:08:26.440
<v Speaker 2>well that's wrong.</v>

2831
02:08:27.130 --> 02:08:28.960
<v Speaker 2>Whoever said that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is more in the heart.</v>

2832
02:08:29.560 --> 02:08:32.230
<v Speaker 2>That's so wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Boy.</v>

2833
02:08:32.231 --> 02:08:35.950
<v Speaker 2>Glad I googled that one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It says it's in both.</v>

2834
02:08:35.980 --> 02:08:37.540
<v Speaker 2>It's in the heart and stomach.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just not,</v>

2835
02:08:37.630 --> 02:08:40.090
<v Speaker 2>there's not more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What did I fucking,</v>

2836
02:08:40.210 --> 02:08:42.620
<v Speaker 2>how did I read that then?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How could someone be that off that I</v>

2837
02:08:42.621 --> 02:08:44.350
<v Speaker 2>read it or it was just my memory is that</v>
<v Speaker 2>bad.</v>

2838
02:08:45.400 --> 02:08:47.830
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to go with my memory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whatever it is.</v>

2839
02:08:48.410 --> 02:08:51.820
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>imagine that those memories in that</v>

2840
02:08:51.821 --> 02:08:56.821
<v Speaker 2>heart remain in the heart and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>transfer your heart into somebody else's</v>

2841
02:08:57.011 --> 02:08:59.620
<v Speaker 2>body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that's what happens when people get</v>

2842
02:08:59.621 --> 02:09:02.830
<v Speaker 2>heart transplants and certain people</v>
<v Speaker 2>have said that they have certain weird</v>

2843
02:09:02.831 --> 02:09:06.220
<v Speaker 2>cravings and they think about things you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

2844
02:09:06.221 --> 02:09:10.000
<v Speaker 2>that they never thought about before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you might be literally</v>

2845
02:09:10.001 --> 02:09:11.920
<v Speaker 2>interfacing with someone else's</v>
<v Speaker 2>memories,</v>

2846
02:09:13.250 --> 02:09:15.760
<v Speaker 2>imagined it in someone else's memories</v>
<v Speaker 2>in your body.</v>

2847
02:09:16.420 --> 02:09:18.190
<v Speaker 2>Like people that kick kidney</v>
<v Speaker 2>transplants.</v>

2848
02:09:19.270 --> 02:09:20.920
<v Speaker 2>How'd you get some memories along with</v>
<v Speaker 2>that and you're like,</v>

2849
02:09:20.921 --> 02:09:24.670
<v Speaker 2>what is this is a dream,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a dream or do I remember some</v>

2850
02:09:24.671 --> 02:09:29.671
<v Speaker 2>shit I did when I was five but it wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>me that Donald Donnie like think about</v>

2851
02:09:31.031 --> 02:09:34.120
<v Speaker 2>your memories of being five.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How fleeting,</v>

2852
02:09:34.480 --> 02:09:37.510
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how like barely visible.</v>

2853
02:09:37.570 --> 02:09:40.480
<v Speaker 2>How like in the darkest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>darkest,</v>

2854
02:09:40.540 --> 02:09:45.540
<v Speaker 2>darkest corner of what you could</v>
<v Speaker 2>possibly describe as a real memory in</v>

2855
02:09:46.121 --> 02:09:51.070
<v Speaker 2>terms of like being able to describe all</v>
<v Speaker 2>the everything around you that this is</v>

2856
02:09:51.071 --> 02:09:53.230
<v Speaker 2>like almost nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're almost nothing there.</v>

2857
02:09:53.500 --> 02:09:56.650
<v Speaker 2>Not to give that to somebody else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Give that to somebody else and they have</v>

2858
02:09:56.651 --> 02:09:59.200
<v Speaker 2>that shit just bouncing around their</v>
<v Speaker 2>head and like,</v>

2859
02:09:59.201 --> 02:10:04.201
<v Speaker 2>am I crazy to really think this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is this a dream or it's the fucking</v>

2860
02:10:05.660 --> 02:10:08.500
<v Speaker 2>kidney,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe in that shit.</v>

2861
02:10:10.720 --> 02:10:12.640
<v Speaker 2>Somebody else's DNA mixing with your</v>
<v Speaker 2>ors?</v>

2862
02:10:12.910 --> 02:10:14.830
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's because of the heart thing</v>

2863
02:10:14.831 --> 02:10:16.350
<v Speaker 2>because it has neurons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2864
02:10:16.720 --> 02:10:20.020
<v Speaker 2>I mean they don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right where memories are stored.</v>

2865
02:10:20.080 --> 02:10:22.510
<v Speaker 2>Do they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do they know that for sure.</v>

2866
02:10:23.710 --> 02:10:28.710
<v Speaker 2>The question would be</v>
<v Speaker 2>every cell in your body reproduces</v>

2867
02:10:30.040 --> 02:10:32.230
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every cell in your body changes.</v>

2868
02:10:32.231 --> 02:10:34.940
<v Speaker 2>And over the course of seven to eight</v>
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>

2869
02:10:35.510 --> 02:10:39.290
<v Speaker 2>you essentially don't have any of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>same cells in your body except your</v>

2870
02:10:39.291 --> 02:10:43.970
<v Speaker 2>neurons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that a urban legend or is that 100%</v>

2871
02:10:43.971 --> 02:10:46.310
<v Speaker 2>real light?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's 100% real.</v>

2872
02:10:47.030 --> 02:10:49.760
<v Speaker 2>I think your body's cells change over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2873
02:10:49.761 --> 02:10:51.650
<v Speaker 2>I've always heard that the neurons do</v>
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>

2874
02:10:51.680 --> 02:10:53.810
<v Speaker 2>you have the same neurons forever</v>
<v Speaker 2>apparently.</v>

2875
02:10:55.040 --> 02:10:56.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which is,</v>

2876
02:10:56.661 --> 02:10:59.300
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the more interesting things about</v>

2877
02:10:59.301 --> 02:11:02.540
<v Speaker 2>some of those neuroprotectant plants and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then,</v>

2878
02:11:02.541 --> 02:11:04.700
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some certain funguses like what does it</v>

2879
02:11:04.701 --> 02:11:08.840
<v Speaker 2>lion's mane that promotes neuro</v>
<v Speaker 2>neurological health.</v>

2880
02:11:10.020 --> 02:11:10.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's certain,</v>

2881
02:11:10.790 --> 02:11:13.430
<v Speaker 2>there's certain mushrooms that actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>are really good for your brain's</v>

2882
02:11:13.431 --> 02:11:15.140
<v Speaker 2>development.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really fascinating.</v>

2883
02:11:15.490 --> 02:11:17.160
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

2884
02:11:17.161 --> 02:11:17.900
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's up?</v>

2885
02:11:17.900 --> 02:11:19.160
<v Speaker 2>I was just looking around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're all,</v>

2886
02:11:19.280 --> 02:11:21.440
<v Speaker 2>every part of your body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It grows at different rates,</v>

2887
02:11:22.340 --> 02:11:25.500
<v Speaker 2>but it over the course of eight years is</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they said that.</v>

2888
02:11:25.520 --> 02:11:25.911
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2889
02:11:25.911 --> 02:11:29.060
<v Speaker 2>that's every eight years the whole</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing's changed over.</v>

2890
02:11:29.480 --> 02:11:31.310
<v Speaker 2>It's like you're a new person every</v>
<v Speaker 2>eight years.</v>

2891
02:11:31.311 --> 02:11:32.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but except your neurons,</v>

2892
02:11:32.800 --> 02:11:35.120
<v Speaker 2>your neurons are where the memories are</v>
<v Speaker 2>stored.</v>

2893
02:11:35.210 --> 02:11:38.390
<v Speaker 2>That would kind of make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think my theory,</v>

2894
02:11:38.391 --> 02:11:41.090
<v Speaker 2>and I'm a fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm no scientist,</v>

2895
02:11:41.360 --> 02:11:46.360
<v Speaker 2>but my theory is that memories that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>have are really just memories of how you</v>

2896
02:11:46.401 --> 02:11:49.790
<v Speaker 2>remember your memories that all of our</v>
<v Speaker 2>memories are like,</v>

2897
02:11:49.791 --> 02:11:51.680
<v Speaker 2>this is weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whispery stories,</v>

2898
02:11:51.681 --> 02:11:53.270
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like a copy.</v>

2899
02:11:54.490 --> 02:11:55.323
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2900
02:11:55.560 --> 02:11:56.393
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I,</v>

2901
02:11:57.870 --> 02:11:58.703
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

2902
02:12:00.070 --> 02:12:04.170
<v Speaker 2>there's certain things that I've done in</v>
<v Speaker 2>my life where I'll look back and I'm</v>

2903
02:12:04.310 --> 02:12:06.130
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even really think that was me.</v>

2904
02:12:07.180 --> 02:12:09.520
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the martial arts stuff particular,</v>

2905
02:12:09.580 --> 02:12:13.030
<v Speaker 2>I do not think that's me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that that definitely wasn't me.</v>

2906
02:12:13.270 --> 02:12:15.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or like even when I watch myself on news</v>

2907
02:12:15.741 --> 02:12:16.990
<v Speaker 2>radio,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2908
02:12:17.050 --> 02:12:19.780
<v Speaker 2>that isn't even me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go watch like a youtube video on my</v>

2909
02:12:19.781 --> 02:12:20.620
<v Speaker 2>car,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't even me.</v>

2910
02:12:21.100 --> 02:12:23.960
<v Speaker 2>I coat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's weird that,</v>

2911
02:12:24.080 --> 02:12:26.950
<v Speaker 2>that this is captured and for most</v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

2912
02:12:26.951 --> 02:12:31.000
<v Speaker 2>most of their life right up until like</v>
<v Speaker 2>the last hundred or so years,</v>

2913
02:12:31.240 --> 02:12:34.420
<v Speaker 2>that was never an option.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was never an option to go back and</v>

2914
02:12:34.421 --> 02:12:37.990
<v Speaker 2>look at yourself from 10 years ago or 20</v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago or 30 years ago.</v>

2915
02:12:38.530 --> 02:12:43.530
<v Speaker 2>But now it's super common place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How much has that affected who people</v>

2916
02:12:44.171 --> 02:12:46.660
<v Speaker 2>are because you become so much more self</v>
<v Speaker 2>aware.</v>

2917
02:12:46.990 --> 02:12:48.760
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember that bit that I was doing last</v>

2918
02:12:48.760 --> 02:12:50.380
<v Speaker 2>year about like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2919
02:12:50.381 --> 02:12:52.870
<v Speaker 2>I was doing my last netflix special</v>
<v Speaker 2>about the selfie.</v>

2920
02:12:53.090 --> 02:12:57.790
<v Speaker 2>I like somehow along the line people</v>
<v Speaker 2>change the way they pose it pictures.</v>

2921
02:12:58.070 --> 02:12:59.470
<v Speaker 2>It does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You look at the first pictures.</v>

2922
02:12:59.590 --> 02:13:01.000
<v Speaker 2>People just stood there and looked</v>
<v Speaker 2>hungry.</v>

2923
02:13:01.310 --> 02:13:03.700
<v Speaker 2>I call holds pictures from the 18</v>
<v Speaker 2>hundreds.</v>

2924
02:13:03.910 --> 02:13:06.310
<v Speaker 2>They just look skinny and gaunt and</v>
<v Speaker 2>hungry.</v>

2925
02:13:06.520 --> 02:13:10.990
<v Speaker 2>And if you saw a picture from like 1860</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there was a girl with her butt out</v>

2926
02:13:10.991 --> 02:13:13.960
<v Speaker 2>and she's doing duck lips,</v>
<v Speaker 2>feel like that pitch is a time traveler.</v>

2927
02:13:14.260 --> 02:13:17.230
<v Speaker 2>There's no way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no way she could have been</v>

2928
02:13:17.231 --> 02:13:19.840
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there's no way someone at that time</v>

2929
02:13:20.020 --> 02:13:22.810
<v Speaker 2>new to pout,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make kissy face and do the peace sign</v>

2930
02:13:22.811 --> 02:13:25.270
<v Speaker 2>and stick your ass out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just that's a pose.</v>

2931
02:13:25.271 --> 02:13:27.580
<v Speaker 2>That's um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a modern pose.</v>

2932
02:13:27.850 --> 02:13:31.500
<v Speaker 2>And it came about because of being</v>
<v Speaker 2>extremely self conscious because so many</v>

2933
02:13:31.501 --> 02:13:32.100
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I</v>

2934
02:13:32.100 --> 02:13:34.200
<v Speaker 5>see images of themselves every,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2935
02:13:34.620 --> 02:13:36.990
<v Speaker 5>did he charge you Magii the grown</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jumanji they're really pretty.</v>

2936
02:13:36.991 --> 02:13:39.030
<v Speaker 5>Girl was obsessed with taking photos of</v>
<v Speaker 5>herself.</v>

2937
02:13:39.270 --> 02:13:40.950
<v Speaker 5>That's fucking really shit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

<v Speaker 5>so kids do right away.</v>

2939

<v Speaker 5>surprisingly best movies I've seen in a</v>

2940

<v Speaker 5>long time.</v>

<v Speaker 5>head.</v>

2959
02:14:25.681 --> 02:14:28.710
<v Speaker 5>Like everybody else,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that guide below the box here,</v>

2960
02:14:28.711 --> 02:14:31.350
<v Speaker 5>it looks like it's not even like he's</v>
<v Speaker 5>trying to like be tough.</v>

2961
02:14:31.351 --> 02:14:34.100
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm just doing a defense that's going to</v>

2962
02:14:34.101 --> 02:14:35.020
<v Speaker 5>lead away.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She,</v>

2963
02:14:35.050 --> 02:14:39.090
<v Speaker 5>I'm not even coming at Ya.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm coming at you with Dick First.</v>

2964
02:14:40.860 --> 02:14:43.200
<v Speaker 5>That's what they would do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They would come at your Dick First.</v>

2965
02:14:43.350 --> 02:14:45.060
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This thing looked like he knows how to</v>

2966
02:14:45.061 --> 02:14:46.230
<v Speaker 5>fight at all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well look away.</v>

2967
02:14:46.231 --> 02:14:49.620
<v Speaker 5>They would hold their hands up to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they held their hands very differently.</v>

2968
02:14:49.830 --> 02:14:52.560
<v Speaker 5>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>those fights were very different fights</v>

2969
02:14:52.920 --> 02:14:56.400
<v Speaker 5>because they had real small gloves.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You couldn't get hit as much.</v>

2970
02:14:56.880 --> 02:14:58.560
<v Speaker 5>You couldn't hit each other as much</v>
<v Speaker 5>either.</v>

2971
02:14:58.590 --> 02:15:01.710
<v Speaker 5>Like you couldn't just like modern</v>
<v Speaker 5>boxing,</v>

2972
02:15:01.890 --> 02:15:05.010
<v Speaker 5>we just flowed with punches and got</v>
<v Speaker 5>crazy with punches.</v>

2973
02:15:05.220 --> 02:15:06.690
<v Speaker 5>You couldn't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You'd break your hands.</v>

2974
02:15:06.800 --> 02:15:09.990
<v Speaker 5>You had to be much more judicious with</v>
<v Speaker 5>where you hit people and they clinched a</v>

2975
02:15:09.991 --> 02:15:11.690
<v Speaker 5>lot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Those old school boxes,</v>

2976
02:15:11.691 --> 02:15:14.040
<v Speaker 5>they would grab each other and wrestle</v>
<v Speaker 5>each other a lot and punch each other.</v>

2977
02:15:14.041 --> 02:15:15.150
<v Speaker 5>In the clinch,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there was a,</v>

2978
02:15:15.151 --> 02:15:18.750
<v Speaker 5>there was a lot more of that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And there is now it's different world so</v>

2979
02:15:18.751 --> 02:15:22.500
<v Speaker 5>I guess they just cause it in heaven</v>
<v Speaker 5>like tiny gloves or no gloves.</v>

2980
02:15:22.680 --> 02:15:26.100
<v Speaker 5>They just decided they're going to try</v>
<v Speaker 5>to lean away from the punches more and</v>

2981
02:15:26.101 --> 02:15:27.900
<v Speaker 5>just kind of jab at each other with</v>
<v Speaker 5>knuckles.</v>

2982
02:15:27.901 --> 02:15:30.900
<v Speaker 5>You can't just wait in like um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean you could if you were Mike Tyson,</v>

2983
02:15:30.901 --> 02:15:33.600
<v Speaker 5>but they just didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they didn't know how to do it right back</v>

2984
02:15:33.601 --> 02:15:35.580
<v Speaker 5>then either.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like even if you watch,</v>

2985
02:15:36.570 --> 02:15:38.940
<v Speaker 5>you go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like if you watch modern boxing,</v>

2986
02:15:38.941 --> 02:15:43.350
<v Speaker 5>like you watch like Canelo Alvarez</v>
<v Speaker 5>versus Gennady Golovkin and you see like</v>

2987
02:15:43.470 --> 02:15:45.900
<v Speaker 5>the two,</v>
<v Speaker 5>two of the highest level guys in the</v>

2988
02:15:45.901 --> 02:15:47.130
<v Speaker 5>game go at each other.</v>

2989
02:15:47.490 --> 02:15:50.670
<v Speaker 5>It looks so much different than watching</v>
<v Speaker 5>like old school boxing.</v>

2990
02:15:50.940 --> 02:15:54.000
<v Speaker 5>Like old school boxing was like you had</v>
<v Speaker 5>sugar ray Robinson.</v>

2991
02:15:54.001 --> 02:15:57.840
<v Speaker 5>It was could have fought and been the</v>
<v Speaker 5>world champion today and then a bunch of</v>

2992
02:15:57.841 --> 02:16:00.600
<v Speaker 5>guys that he beat the shit out of.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then you have a bunch of guys that</v>

2993
02:16:00.601 --> 02:16:04.920
<v Speaker 5>have like one kind of style and there's</v>
<v Speaker 5>inconsistencies in the greatness.</v>

2994
02:16:05.490 --> 02:16:07.800
<v Speaker 5>Like some of them look like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like Marvin Hagler could have been a</v>

2995
02:16:07.801 --> 02:16:10.980
<v Speaker 5>world champion today.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then other ones you go back like way</v>

2996
02:16:10.981 --> 02:16:13.260
<v Speaker 5>far back and you go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hmm,</v>

2997
02:16:13.290 --> 02:16:15.300
<v Speaker 5>this guy's got like this weird fucking</v>
<v Speaker 5>style.</v>

2998
02:16:15.301 --> 02:16:18.900
<v Speaker 5>Like a wonder if the style is just</v>
<v Speaker 5>derived because of the little gloves and</v>

2999
02:16:19.350 --> 02:16:21.180
<v Speaker 5>they just didn't know as much about</v>
<v Speaker 5>boxing.</v>

3000
02:16:21.181 --> 02:16:21.900
<v Speaker 5>Then like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>watch,</v>

3001
02:16:21.900 --> 02:16:23.910
<v Speaker 5>go watch it like an old jim jefferies</v>
<v Speaker 5>fight.</v>

3002
02:16:24.150 --> 02:16:26.100
<v Speaker 5>And then imagine what Lennox Lewis would</v>
<v Speaker 5>do to him.</v>

3003
02:16:26.460 --> 02:16:27.150
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like there's,</v>

3004
02:16:27.150 --> 02:16:29.410
<v Speaker 5>there's levels that guy's got to where</v>
<v Speaker 5>they were just,</v>

3005
02:16:29.550 --> 02:16:30.070
<v Speaker 5>they were on</v>

3006
02:16:30.070 --> 02:16:33.880
<v Speaker 2>another level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like clearly who's that referee,</v>

3007
02:16:33.881 --> 02:16:37.120
<v Speaker 2>that boxing referee that it's been like</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a video lately on twitter that is</v>

3008
02:16:37.121 --> 02:16:39.190
<v Speaker 2>like the funniest shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember his name,</v>

3009
02:16:39.191 --> 02:16:41.830
<v Speaker 2>but I know what you're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like loves his job and he's just in the</v>

3010
02:16:41.831 --> 02:16:42.970
<v Speaker 2>background.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're like smiling.</v>

3011
02:16:43.690 --> 02:16:45.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hilarious.</v>

3012
02:16:45.700 --> 02:16:46.840
<v Speaker 2>I forget his name.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3013
02:16:47.060 --> 02:16:50.530
<v Speaker 2>this was a great video though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Expressions are fucking hilarious.</v>

3014
02:16:50.531 --> 02:16:52.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dudes get popped and he goes,</v>

3015
02:16:52.620 --> 02:16:56.350
<v Speaker 2>oh dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do boxing referee's ever go to the UFC</v>

3016
02:16:56.380 --> 02:16:57.680
<v Speaker 2>or this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his name was Steve,</v>

3017
02:16:57.940 --> 02:17:00.420
<v Speaker 2>Steve Willis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He will accept playlists.</v>

3018
02:17:01.510 --> 02:17:03.430
<v Speaker 2>I'll fix your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why it's not playing.</v>

3019
02:17:03.670 --> 02:17:08.650
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I usually just reload and that the whole</v>

3020
02:17:08.651 --> 02:17:10.330
<v Speaker 2>video is still video.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3021
02:17:10.331 --> 02:17:13.360
<v Speaker 2>it's a still video.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3022
02:17:13.361 --> 02:17:15.670
<v Speaker 2>that's probably what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3023
02:17:17.650 --> 02:17:18.820
<v Speaker 2>he's a hilarious guy.</v>

3024
02:17:21.010 --> 02:17:22.780
<v Speaker 2>He gets very excited.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3025
02:17:23.650 --> 02:17:25.870
<v Speaker 2>But these are good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A good referee.</v>

3026
02:17:26.050 --> 02:17:28.600
<v Speaker 2>He's great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And not just enthusiastic.</v>

3027
02:17:28.601 --> 02:17:30.430
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a good thing to do to give a guy</v>

3028
02:17:30.431 --> 02:17:32.170
<v Speaker 2>a real clear eight count.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3029
02:17:32.480 --> 02:17:35.680
<v Speaker 2>got the best expressions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Shit.</v>

3030
02:17:36.430 --> 02:17:38.260
<v Speaker 2>Terrence Crawford,</v>
<v Speaker 2>terrence Crawford.</v>

3031
02:17:38.290 --> 02:17:41.230
<v Speaker 2>Beat your ass and then talk shit after</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get stopped.</v>

3032
02:17:42.820 --> 02:17:45.280
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>terrence Crawford is one of the best</v>

3033
02:17:45.281 --> 02:17:46.780
<v Speaker 2>pound for pound fighters in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brian,</v>

3034
02:17:47.530 --> 02:17:49.530
<v Speaker 2>better learn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started to go beat yourself.</v>

3035
02:17:49.540 --> 02:17:51.430
<v Speaker 2>Learned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is that?</v>

3036
02:17:52.860 --> 02:17:55.900
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>connor talkers up open bed already and</v>

3037
02:17:55.910 --> 02:17:58.990
<v Speaker 2>make May.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whether applying for MMA law license</v>

3038
02:17:58.991 --> 02:18:01.900
<v Speaker 2>wants six to eight months to train.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's screwed.</v>

3039
02:18:03.340 --> 02:18:05.440
<v Speaker 2>This is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in my opinion,</v>

3040
02:18:05.620 --> 02:18:10.620
<v Speaker 2>this is a 40% proposition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which means it's 40% likely that he</v>

3041
02:18:10.841 --> 02:18:13.750
<v Speaker 2>might actually do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The reason why he might do this is</v>

3042
02:18:13.751 --> 02:18:17.920
<v Speaker 2>because I think they will give him in on</v>
<v Speaker 2>godly som of money.</v>

3043
02:18:18.220 --> 02:18:21.160
<v Speaker 2>I mean an ungodly sum and I think they</v>
<v Speaker 2>should.</v>

3044
02:18:21.640 --> 02:18:26.640
<v Speaker 2>I think that if the UFC can talk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>floyd mayweather into going into an mma</v>

3045
02:18:26.681 --> 02:18:27.910
<v Speaker 2>ring,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

3046
02:18:28.210 --> 02:18:32.830
<v Speaker 2>they should give him everything they can</v>
<v Speaker 2>get their greasy pause on to get them to</v>

3047
02:18:32.831 --> 02:18:34.150
<v Speaker 2>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Conor and MMA fight.</v>

3048
02:18:34.210 --> 02:18:34.900
<v Speaker 2>Just say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

3049
02:18:34.900 --> 02:18:38.080
<v Speaker 2>we can give you cm punk will give you cm</v>
<v Speaker 2>punk for half of them.</v>

3050
02:18:38.200 --> 02:18:41.050
<v Speaker 2>Half a bill I half a billion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a lot of money but you can go</v>

3051
02:18:41.051 --> 02:18:45.730
<v Speaker 2>through that in five years instead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How about we give you conor mcgregor for</v>

3052
02:18:45.731 --> 02:18:50.440
<v Speaker 2>a full billy and we'll give you six to</v>
<v Speaker 2>eight months to practice Jiu Jitsu.</v>

3053
02:18:50.800 --> 02:18:55.000
<v Speaker 2>Six six to eight months to just figure</v>
<v Speaker 2>out how you're going to get fucked up.</v>

3054
02:18:55.030 --> 02:18:58.330
<v Speaker 2>You'd be screwed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wouldn't just be screwed.</v>

3055
02:18:58.331 --> 02:19:02.590
<v Speaker 2>That's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's unfair to like for people that</v>

3056
02:19:02.591 --> 02:19:07.540
<v Speaker 2>have been screwed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You would need a way more way more</v>

3057
02:19:07.570 --> 02:19:12.570
<v Speaker 2>outrageous example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not just getting screwed what he's,</v>

3058
02:19:13.780 --> 02:19:18.780
<v Speaker 2>he would like someone said it should be</v>
<v Speaker 2>a thousand to one that's not high</v>

3059
02:19:18.791 --> 02:19:20.800
<v Speaker 2>enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not high enough.</v>

3060
02:19:20.890 --> 02:19:24.670
<v Speaker 2>If conor mcgregor was going to fight</v>
<v Speaker 2>floyd mayweather in mma,</v>

3061
02:19:24.671 --> 02:19:28.100
<v Speaker 2>it is as close to 100%</v>

3062
02:19:28.310 --> 02:19:31.970
<v Speaker 5>as anything ever gets ever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cause if you think floyd is all of a</v>

3063
02:19:31.971 --> 02:19:36.971
<v Speaker 5>sudden going to become this</v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking one punch destroyer like John</v>

3064
02:19:39.531 --> 02:19:42.320
<v Speaker 5>the bees Mugabi in the 1980s or wherever</v>
<v Speaker 5>the fuck that was,</v>

3065
02:19:42.530 --> 02:19:44.120
<v Speaker 5>if you think that's going to happen out</v>
<v Speaker 5>of nowhere,</v>

3066
02:19:44.121 --> 02:19:46.340
<v Speaker 5>you're crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's not what's going to happen.</v>

3067
02:19:46.490 --> 02:19:49.880
<v Speaker 5>What's going to happen is he's probably</v>
<v Speaker 5>gonna Punch Connor in the face a couple</v>

3068
02:19:49.881 --> 02:19:51.890
<v Speaker 5>of times.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's probably going to suck,</v>

3069
02:19:52.160 --> 02:19:56.240
<v Speaker 5>but Khan is going to get ahold of him</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then he's going to be like a baby.</v>

3070
02:19:56.600 --> 02:19:59.840
<v Speaker 5>And if that doesn't happen,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he'll kick floyd's legs out from under</v>

3071
02:19:59.841 --> 02:20:02.450
<v Speaker 5>him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He'll kick his legs sideways,</v>

3072
02:20:02.451 --> 02:20:05.210
<v Speaker 5>he'll kick them from the outside,</v>
<v Speaker 5>will kick them from the inside.</v>

3073
02:20:05.390 --> 02:20:10.070
<v Speaker 5>He'll stay way the fuck away from any</v>
<v Speaker 5>sort of arrange where floyd can punch</v>

3074
02:20:10.071 --> 02:20:12.350
<v Speaker 5>him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It'll be a completely alien range for</v>

3075
02:20:12.351 --> 02:20:15.110
<v Speaker 5>floyd.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And every time floyd goes in front kick</v>

3076
02:20:15.111 --> 02:20:16.190
<v Speaker 5>to the stomach,</v>
<v Speaker 5>boom,</v>

3077
02:20:16.191 --> 02:20:17.720
<v Speaker 5>front kick to the stomach,</v>
<v Speaker 5>boom,</v>

3078
02:20:17.840 --> 02:20:18.830
<v Speaker 5>front kick to the stomach.</v>

3079
02:20:18.920 --> 02:20:20.810
<v Speaker 5>How many of those can you take?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

3080
02:20:20.811 --> 02:20:22.220
<v Speaker 5>boom.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Inside leg kick.</v>

3081
02:20:22.221 --> 02:20:24.890
<v Speaker 5>Boehm outside leg kick.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's laughing at you now.</v>

3082
02:20:24.980 --> 02:20:27.590
<v Speaker 5>Now he's talking Shit and you realize</v>
<v Speaker 5>you've got to get past those legs.</v>

3083
02:20:27.800 --> 02:20:29.430
<v Speaker 5>You could try to close the distance.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Boom,</v>

3084
02:20:29.431 --> 02:20:30.710
<v Speaker 5>spinning back,</v>
<v Speaker 5>kick to the liver.</v>

3085
02:20:30.890 --> 02:20:33.140
<v Speaker 5>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What are you going to do now?</v>

3086
02:20:33.170 --> 02:20:36.290
<v Speaker 5>What are you gonna do now?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're going to be picked apart until he</v>

3087
02:20:36.291 --> 02:20:39.860
<v Speaker 5>decides to take you to the ground and</v>
<v Speaker 5>cut your face open with elbows.</v>

3088
02:20:40.040 --> 02:20:43.220
<v Speaker 5>How about that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>How about he pins your right arm down</v>

3089
02:20:43.221 --> 02:20:46.370
<v Speaker 5>with his left Shin,</v>
<v Speaker 5>gets on top of you and just start</v>

3090
02:20:46.371 --> 02:20:50.150
<v Speaker 5>smashing the edge of the elbow into your</v>
<v Speaker 5>eye sockets,</v>

3091
02:20:50.270 --> 02:20:54.080
<v Speaker 5>into your nose,</v>
<v Speaker 5>cuts across your forehead slices you</v>

3092
02:20:54.081 --> 02:20:58.280
<v Speaker 5>opened like a fucking melon.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't have a chance.</v>

3093
02:20:58.340 --> 02:21:03.340
<v Speaker 5>No one has a chance that hasn't had a</v>
<v Speaker 5>long history of grappling and getting</v>

3094
02:21:03.951 --> 02:21:04.784
<v Speaker 5>kicked.</v>

3095
02:21:05.240 --> 02:21:09.770
<v Speaker 5>It's like you're a regular boxer is like</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially the best ever like floyd.</v>

3096
02:21:09.920 --> 02:21:14.920
<v Speaker 5>It's phenomenal at what he does,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but if you put takedowns and kicks into</v>

3097
02:21:15.230 --> 02:21:16.011
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it changes.</v>

3098
02:21:16.011 --> 02:21:18.170
<v Speaker 5>Everything,</v>
<v Speaker 5>changes everything.</v>

3099
02:21:19.010 --> 02:21:21.350
<v Speaker 5>He'd be fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wonder if he's done any training at</v>

3100
02:21:21.351 --> 02:21:22.490
<v Speaker 5>all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3101
02:21:22.491 --> 02:21:27.440
<v Speaker 5>I know these talk to Tyron Woodley and</v>
<v Speaker 5>Tyron Woodley was a apparently willing</v>

3102
02:21:27.441 --> 02:21:29.960
<v Speaker 5>to help him prepare.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That would be very interesting because</v>

3103
02:21:29.961 --> 02:21:33.200
<v Speaker 5>Willie's had some issues with connor.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think he's going to fight conor</v>

3104
02:21:33.201 --> 02:21:35.720
<v Speaker 5>though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think if he does choose to fight mma,</v>

3105
02:21:35.990 --> 02:21:40.730
<v Speaker 5>I really believe the move is the correct</v>
<v Speaker 5>move is you fight someone like cm punk.</v>

3106
02:21:41.270 --> 02:21:45.470
<v Speaker 5>Cause with cm you got a guy who's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's been training in mma for a long</v>

3107
02:21:45.471 --> 02:21:46.880
<v Speaker 5>time now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's been a few years,</v>

3108
02:21:46.881 --> 02:21:48.380
<v Speaker 5>not a long time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but a few years now.</v>

3109
02:21:48.381 --> 02:21:52.550
<v Speaker 5>He had one mma fight in the UFC but was</v>
<v Speaker 5>very overmatched it.</v>

3110
02:21:52.550 --> 02:21:56.600
<v Speaker 5>We really wasn't fair like for him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Didn't make it that kid.</v>

3111
02:21:57.080 --> 02:22:00.110
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's just the difference between</v>
<v Speaker 5>the two of them.</v>

3112
02:22:00.560 --> 02:22:04.850
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Micky Gall is a real professional elite</v>

3113
02:22:04.851 --> 02:22:08.490
<v Speaker 5>fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean he can beat really good guys and</v>

3114
02:22:09.140 --> 02:22:12.090
<v Speaker 5>he's just not in that world.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like cm pucks,</v>

3115
02:22:12.110 --> 02:22:16.700
<v Speaker 5>a 40 year old guy who is a professional</v>
<v Speaker 5>entertainer who is basically a beginner.</v>

3116
02:22:16.840 --> 02:22:20.300
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But he knows enough where you would,</v>

3117
02:22:20.390 --> 02:22:23.710
<v Speaker 5>we would bet money on him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He knows enough where you're like,</v>

3118
02:22:23.711 --> 02:22:28.470
<v Speaker 5>imagine if cm punk who is a big guy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he cuts down to one 70 and compare it to</v>

3119
02:22:28.471 --> 02:22:31.800
<v Speaker 5>floyd floyd's fight it like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think he fought it started this</v>

3120
02:22:31.810 --> 02:22:36.510
<v Speaker 5>career.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want to say one 31 35 we'll go to</v>

3121
02:22:36.511 --> 02:22:40.140
<v Speaker 5>floyd mayweather's beginning fights,</v>
<v Speaker 5>see what,</v>

3122
02:22:40.620 --> 02:22:45.330
<v Speaker 5>but at the very least he's definitely</v>
<v Speaker 5>fought at one 45 as a grown man.</v>

3123
02:22:45.510 --> 02:22:48.800
<v Speaker 5>He's fought at one 55</v>
<v Speaker 5>cm punk,</v>

3124
02:22:48.810 --> 02:22:49.530
<v Speaker 5>way bigger.</v>

3125
02:22:49.530 --> 02:22:52.470
<v Speaker 5>He's just a way bigger guy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So if he could figure out a way to get</v>

3126
02:22:52.471 --> 02:22:56.340
<v Speaker 5>to fight to the ground and like lock in</v>
<v Speaker 5>something simple like a guillotine,</v>

3127
02:22:56.610 --> 02:22:59.130
<v Speaker 5>if he has a good Ghia teen,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's what I would say.</v>

3128
02:22:59.250 --> 02:23:01.050
<v Speaker 5>If I was going to work with a guy like</v>
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

3129
02:23:01.051 --> 02:23:03.090
<v Speaker 5>I would say you're going to come,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're going to concentrate on one</v>

3130
02:23:03.210 --> 02:23:07.440
<v Speaker 5>fucking choke and we're going to get</v>
<v Speaker 5>that thing down to like laser beam.</v>

3131
02:23:08.040 --> 02:23:12.480
<v Speaker 5>Perfect precision.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So just if you just spent all your time</v>

3132
02:23:12.481 --> 02:23:15.600
<v Speaker 5>doing like one Marcello Garcia style</v>
<v Speaker 5>choke,</v>

3133
02:23:15.601 --> 02:23:20.280
<v Speaker 5>just figured out one good show,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one where you know that if you get that</v>

3134
02:23:20.340 --> 02:23:24.390
<v Speaker 5>Chin down,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you tuck it in and slap it on one choke,</v>

3135
02:23:24.391 --> 02:23:28.440
<v Speaker 5>whatever it is that you know how to</v>
<v Speaker 5>close that fucker up 90% of the time on</v>

3136
02:23:28.441 --> 02:23:31.080
<v Speaker 5>people that know how to defend.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of guys that have that</v>

3137
02:23:31.081 --> 02:23:34.530
<v Speaker 5>like maybe they'd have a triangle or</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe they have a head in our head and</v>

3138
02:23:34.531 --> 02:23:35.490
<v Speaker 5>arm choke is a good one.</v>

3139
02:23:35.520 --> 02:23:38.880
<v Speaker 5>That's a good one to master.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Some guy just finished most people with</v>

3140
02:23:38.881 --> 02:23:42.990
<v Speaker 5>like that one choke if he just had that</v>
<v Speaker 5>and just got fully to the ground and</v>

3141
02:23:42.991 --> 02:23:46.740
<v Speaker 5>just got his neck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's super super possible that he could</v>

3142
02:23:46.741 --> 02:23:51.060
<v Speaker 5>win like it's possible that he could win</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's also possible the floyd can</v>

3143
02:23:51.061 --> 02:23:53.190
<v Speaker 5>win.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what makes that interesting cause</v>

3144
02:23:53.191 --> 02:23:56.460
<v Speaker 5>floyd is still one of the best boxers of</v>
<v Speaker 5>all time if not the best,</v>

3145
02:23:56.580 --> 02:24:01.180
<v Speaker 5>still a fucking elite athlete.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Still light speed in the,</v>

3146
02:24:01.181 --> 02:24:03.270
<v Speaker 5>in there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like with his footwork and his movement,</v>

3147
02:24:03.271 --> 02:24:05.550
<v Speaker 5>his head movement,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's so fast,</v>

3148
02:24:05.850 --> 02:24:09.780
<v Speaker 5>he's going to be way faster and cm punk.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So if cm punk can't get ahold of them,</v>

3149
02:24:09.900 --> 02:24:13.620
<v Speaker 5>and every time he moves in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he gets his face lit up with a dude</v>

3150
02:24:13.621 --> 02:24:16.200
<v Speaker 5>who's fast as fuck with six ounce</v>
<v Speaker 5>gloves.</v>

3151
02:24:16.201 --> 02:24:19.170
<v Speaker 5>Now he's got four ounce gloves on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very little padding and he's catching</v>

3152
02:24:19.171 --> 02:24:22.440
<v Speaker 5>you right on the chin and you can't do</v>
<v Speaker 5>shit about it.</v>

3153
02:24:22.441 --> 02:24:24.090
<v Speaker 5>You're trying to close the distance and</v>
<v Speaker 5>he stutter,</v>

3154
02:24:24.091 --> 02:24:27.660
<v Speaker 5>step in and move it in front of you and</v>
<v Speaker 5>cm punk is not like the best kicker in</v>

3155
02:24:27.661 --> 02:24:31.110
<v Speaker 5>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll buy it,</v>

3156
02:24:31.500 --> 02:24:32.333
<v Speaker 5>I'll buy it.</v>

3157
02:24:32.940 --> 02:24:34.940
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he'll have to fight me.</v>

3158
02:24:34.941 --> 02:24:39.290
<v Speaker 1>Whether if he comes to mma that would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you mean you'd have to fight,</v>

3159
02:24:39.310 --> 02:24:40.143
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or uh,</v>

3160
02:24:40.340 --> 02:24:41.690
<v Speaker 1>connor connor?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

3161
02:24:41.840 --> 02:24:42.673
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't.</v>

3162
02:24:42.770 --> 02:24:44.720
<v Speaker 1>You don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'd get killed.</v>

3163
02:24:44.870 --> 02:24:47.930
<v Speaker 1>He would literally get killed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

3164
02:24:47.931 --> 02:24:50.450
<v Speaker 1>but that he would get smashed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She ends up doing it my may.</v>

3165
02:24:50.451 --> 02:24:51.820
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone wants to see that though.</v>

3166
02:24:51.840 --> 02:24:53.450
<v Speaker 1>That's what everybody wants to see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For sure.</v>

3167
02:24:53.451 --> 02:24:55.960
<v Speaker 1>Rhonda and him fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be a good one.</v>

3168
02:24:57.090 --> 02:24:59.900
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3169
02:24:59.970 --> 02:25:03.630
<v Speaker 5>I don't think he's going to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think he's gonna Fight Mcgregor</v>

3170
02:25:03.631 --> 02:25:06.090
<v Speaker 5>ever and mma,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I think you might fight cm punk.</v>

3171
02:25:06.450 --> 02:25:08.130
<v Speaker 5>I believe that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I believe that could happen.</v>

3172
02:25:08.131 --> 02:25:11.400
<v Speaker 5>I know they're not even,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's not even like official talk,</v>

3173
02:25:11.850 --> 02:25:14.760
<v Speaker 5>but I really believe that can happen.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It sounds crazy.</v>

3174
02:25:14.761 --> 02:25:17.220
<v Speaker 5>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the whole thing sounds crazy.</v>

3175
02:25:17.250 --> 02:25:21.360
<v Speaker 5>It sounds crazy to think that he could</v>
<v Speaker 5>fight anybody in mma that he would be</v>

3176
02:25:21.361 --> 02:25:23.860
<v Speaker 5>willing to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He must know something</v>

3177
02:25:25.330 --> 02:25:28.840
<v Speaker 2>because he could just go into boxing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He must know that he's his time as a</v>

3178
02:25:28.841 --> 02:25:29.980
<v Speaker 2>boxer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just done.</v>

3179
02:25:30.940 --> 02:25:32.860
<v Speaker 2>Who Cares?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have enough money to do what you</v>

3180
02:25:32.861 --> 02:25:33.671
<v Speaker 2>want to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

3181
02:25:33.671 --> 02:25:35.410
<v Speaker 2>you don't understand.</v>

<v Speaker 2>he's a silly fella,</v>

3217
02:27:25.240 --> 02:27:27.550
<v Speaker 2>but he's also the greatest boxer of all</v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

3218
02:27:27.670 --> 02:27:30.910
<v Speaker 2>He's also unbelievably physically</v>
<v Speaker 2>talented isolation or uh,</v>

3219
02:27:31.160 --> 02:27:32.920
<v Speaker 2>so that's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cryo.</v>

3220
02:27:32.980 --> 02:27:34.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3221
02:27:34.061 --> 02:27:35.680
<v Speaker 2>He's got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got to learn about the one where</v>

3222
02:27:35.681 --> 02:27:36.880
<v Speaker 2>your whole head gives under.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3223
02:27:36.881 --> 02:27:38.290
<v Speaker 2>Is that better?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That they'll feel better?</v>

3224
02:27:38.650 --> 02:27:40.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's way better.</v>

3225
02:27:40.660 --> 02:27:41.261
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll see.</v>

3226
02:27:41.261 --> 02:27:42.820
<v Speaker 2>Seen enough money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>team jewelry,</v>

3227
02:27:43.390 --> 02:27:46.680
<v Speaker 2>but he's got millions of dollars and</v>
<v Speaker 2>just jewelry to,</v>

3228
02:27:46.690 --> 02:27:47.740
<v Speaker 2>it's very interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

3229
02:27:47.980 --> 02:27:50.680
<v Speaker 2>It's very interesting because what he is</v>
<v Speaker 2>is like a,</v>

3230
02:27:51.280 --> 02:27:56.280
<v Speaker 2>he's the most like braggy showy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a rich,</v>

3231
02:27:56.830 --> 02:27:58.420
<v Speaker 2>rich type guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And because of that,</v>

3232
02:27:58.421 --> 02:28:01.060
<v Speaker 2>people go to see him fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hoping he's going to lose,</v>

3233
02:28:01.061 --> 02:28:04.930
<v Speaker 2>and he always wins.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's genius way to make yourself</v>

3234
02:28:04.931 --> 02:28:08.350
<v Speaker 2>exciting because he has a really smart</v>
<v Speaker 2>boxing style.</v>

3235
02:28:08.420 --> 02:28:12.340
<v Speaker 2>I like his style is extremely defensive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he's one of the best defensive</v>

3236
02:28:12.341 --> 02:28:14.560
<v Speaker 2>boxers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if not the best of all time.</v>

3237
02:28:14.740 --> 02:28:18.850
<v Speaker 2>It's very hard to hit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when he's boxing and he's like hardly</v>

3238
02:28:18.851 --> 02:28:21.980
<v Speaker 2>ever getting hit and winning decisions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like there's gotta be a</v>

3239
02:28:21.980 --> 02:28:23.840
<v Speaker 5>way to get people to keep coming to</v>
<v Speaker 5>these fights.</v>

3240
02:28:23.870 --> 02:28:28.400
<v Speaker 5>And this is the way everybody like</v>
<v Speaker 5>rooting against you have ever.</v>

3241
02:28:28.410 --> 02:28:30.050
<v Speaker 5>But look at all this money.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You ain't got shit.</v>

3242
02:28:30.080 --> 02:28:31.670
<v Speaker 5>Look at all my money.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look at this car.</v>

<v Speaker 5>that's about all you got.</v>

3246
02:28:42.550 --> 02:28:45.590
<v Speaker 5>Now</v>

02:28:45.950 --> 02:28:47.660
<v Speaker 5>Everybody gets tired.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Except Kurt Metzger.</v>

3248
02:28:47.870 --> 02:28:50.930
<v Speaker 5>We had Kurt Metzger on yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He had 150 red bulls.</v>

3249
02:28:51.350 --> 02:28:55.960
<v Speaker 5>He had 16 different caveman coffee</v>
<v Speaker 5>nitros how many did he have while we</v>

3250
02:28:55.961 --> 02:28:56.990
<v Speaker 5>were here?</v>
<v Speaker 5>He had at least two.</v>

3251
02:28:57.020 --> 02:28:57.621
<v Speaker 5>I think he,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

3252
02:28:57.621 --> 02:28:59.900
<v Speaker 5>he walked in and drink and one,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think he had two more early on and a</v>

3253
02:28:59.901 --> 02:29:00.440
<v Speaker 5>half.</v>
<v Speaker 5>At least.</v>

3254
02:29:00.440 --> 02:29:04.490
<v Speaker 5>He had three total and a poor.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh and Benjamin got talked over.</v>

3255
02:29:04.491 --> 02:29:09.491
<v Speaker 5>So go to huge penis.com and check out</v>
<v Speaker 5>owens a new special that he released.</v>

3256
02:29:09.620 --> 02:29:13.070
<v Speaker 5>He shot it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>filled it himself and released it on his</v>

3257
02:29:13.071 --> 02:29:15.710
<v Speaker 5>website,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is huge pianist because he's huge.</v>

3258
02:29:15.820 --> 02:29:18.260
<v Speaker 5>I just forget how big he is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He said when he came in here and gave me</v>

3259
02:29:18.261 --> 02:29:19.760
<v Speaker 5>a hug yesterday,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was like a little kid.</v>

3260
02:29:19.970 --> 02:29:21.890
<v Speaker 5>I'm dick hide on him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's six,</v>

3261
02:29:21.891 --> 02:29:23.060
<v Speaker 5>seven.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's six,</v>

3262
02:29:23.061 --> 02:29:25.850
<v Speaker 5>seven.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's almost a foot taller than me.</v>

3263
02:29:25.910 --> 02:29:29.930
<v Speaker 5>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's a giant human in a big barrel.</v>

3264
02:29:30.110 --> 02:29:31.940
<v Speaker 5>Fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then I think he's gotten bigger</v>

3265
02:29:31.941 --> 02:29:33.440
<v Speaker 5>since he's moved to the woods.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

3266
02:29:33.830 --> 02:29:36.380
<v Speaker 5>Cause he's been upstate New York.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I feel like he's grown.</v>

3267
02:29:37.070 --> 02:29:40.070
<v Speaker 5>It just seems like he's like fitting</v>
<v Speaker 5>into the environment.</v>

3268
02:29:40.071 --> 02:29:42.110
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is a thing that animals do in the</v>

3269
02:29:42.111 --> 02:29:43.190
<v Speaker 5>colder,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3270
02:29:43.970 --> 02:29:47.640
<v Speaker 5>the colder parts of their reach or</v>
<v Speaker 5>their,</v>

3271
02:29:47.920 --> 02:29:49.190
<v Speaker 5>where they are,</v>
<v Speaker 5>where they roam.</v>

3272
02:29:49.530 --> 02:29:51.770
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they get larger.</v>

3273
02:29:52.910 --> 02:29:56.270
<v Speaker 5>So like if an animal in the range,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's the word I was looking for.</v>

3274
02:29:56.450 --> 02:30:00.960
<v Speaker 5>Like if an animal has a winter range or</v>
<v Speaker 5>an animal has like a like say like white</v>

3275
02:30:00.961 --> 02:30:03.380
<v Speaker 5>tail deer,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a whitetail deer in Florida is real</v>

3276
02:30:03.381 --> 02:30:04.910
<v Speaker 5>tiny thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We only have a hundred pounds.</v>

3277
02:30:05.350 --> 02:30:07.490
<v Speaker 5>You go to a whitetail deer in</v>
<v Speaker 5>Saskatchewan,</v>

3278
02:30:07.590 --> 02:30:09.860
<v Speaker 5>they were like 300 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're huge.</v>

3279
02:30:10.070 --> 02:30:13.430
<v Speaker 5>They're giant ass fucking deer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's like as big as a white tail</v>

3280
02:30:13.431 --> 02:30:15.350
<v Speaker 5>deer gets.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they di they look massive.</v>

3281
02:30:15.650 --> 02:30:18.980
<v Speaker 5>They're just a different animal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's because when the colder climates,</v>

3282
02:30:19.340 --> 02:30:22.040
<v Speaker 5>they have to have more body mass to stay</v>
<v Speaker 5>warm.</v>

3283
02:30:22.280 --> 02:30:25.640
<v Speaker 5>That's why polar bears are the biggest</v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking bears called polar bears.</v>

3284
02:30:25.641 --> 02:30:27.800
<v Speaker 5>And then Kodiak Grizzlies I think are</v>
<v Speaker 5>also,</v>

3285
02:30:28.340 --> 02:30:30.560
<v Speaker 5>they're pretty close.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But the Kodiak Brown bears,</v>

3286
02:30:30.561 --> 02:30:32.030
<v Speaker 5>it's just because there's salmon</v>
<v Speaker 5>everywhere.</v>

3287
02:30:32.031 --> 02:30:34.490
<v Speaker 5>They're just feasting these fucking</v>
<v Speaker 5>monsters.</v>

3288
02:30:36.020 --> 02:30:40.520
<v Speaker 5>Do your feet grow the older you got?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because when I've gone up like from like</v>

3289
02:30:40.850 --> 02:30:44.160
<v Speaker 5>10 to like now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>almost 12 he takes can't vary too.</v>

3290
02:30:44.160 --> 02:30:46.940
<v Speaker 5>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's Dick Pills and it was idea.</v>

3291
02:30:48.740 --> 02:30:50.270
<v Speaker 5>That's a good move to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3292
02:30:50.420 --> 02:30:51.500
<v Speaker 5>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3293
02:30:51.560 --> 02:30:53.090
<v Speaker 5>what you're carrying around a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 5>weight,</v>

3294
02:30:54.280 --> 02:30:55.970
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you think about what you weigh and how</v>

3295
02:30:55.971 --> 02:30:58.670
<v Speaker 5>many times your feet are walking around,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would imagine.</v>

3296
02:30:59.240 --> 02:31:01.880
<v Speaker 5>But you didn't your,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're just in a am I did a half size,</v>

3297
02:31:01.881 --> 02:31:04.310
<v Speaker 5>half size.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I used to be a 10 and a half and then</v>

3298
02:31:04.311 --> 02:31:09.311
<v Speaker 5>somewhere around 30 ish.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My Shit was like getting cramped in a 10</v>

3299
02:31:09.981 --> 02:31:11.960
<v Speaker 5>and a half.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then I moved to an 11.</v>

3300
02:31:12.020 --> 02:31:14.390
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Although I have found recently that 10</v>

3301
02:31:14.391 --> 02:31:19.070
<v Speaker 5>and a half fits better for me in those</v>
<v Speaker 5>five finger shoes for whatever reason.</v>

3302
02:31:19.950 --> 02:31:20.070
<v Speaker 5>I</v>

3303
02:31:20.070 --> 02:31:22.730
<v Speaker 2>think I had one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think one of them might just getting</v>

3304
02:31:22.890 --> 02:31:25.110
<v Speaker 2>stretched out a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just get,</v>

3305
02:31:25.780 --> 02:31:27.360
<v Speaker 2>I beat the fuck out of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3306
02:31:27.361 --> 02:31:31.680
<v Speaker 2>I'm taking those things on these serious</v>
<v Speaker 2>hills and they get stretched out.</v>

3307
02:31:31.950 --> 02:31:33.930
<v Speaker 2>You're working out now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you doing?</v>

3308
02:31:34.400 --> 02:31:36.700
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>30 to 40 minutes of Cardio and then</v>

3309
02:31:36.710 --> 02:31:40.550
<v Speaker 3>about 20 minutes of weights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I just did this new step cardio</v>

3310
02:31:40.551 --> 02:31:42.890
<v Speaker 3>thing by mistake the other day and</v>
<v Speaker 3>killed me.</v>

3311
02:31:43.100 --> 02:31:45.890
<v Speaker 3>Like the ones where you're kind of</v>
<v Speaker 3>climbing up stairs while doing,</v>

<v Speaker 3>which is normal,</v>

<v Speaker 2>difficult.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Which one that is.</v>

3338
02:32:36.140 --> 02:32:40.820
<v Speaker 2>There's a few of those places now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that is a fad or do you</v>

3339
02:32:40.821 --> 02:32:42.560
<v Speaker 2>think this is going to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3340
02:32:42.890 --> 02:32:44.240
<v Speaker 2>Bert?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No crap.</v>

3341
02:32:47.610 --> 02:32:48.350
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

3342
02:32:48.350 --> 02:32:50.390
<v Speaker 2>There's real benefits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it feels good,</v>

3343
02:32:50.660 --> 02:32:52.370
<v Speaker 2>it feels really good when you get out</v>
<v Speaker 2>like your,</v>

3344
02:32:52.400 --> 02:32:56.930
<v Speaker 2>your body feels good and it's because of</v>
<v Speaker 2>your brain produces really strong</v>

3345
02:32:56.931 --> 02:32:58.490
<v Speaker 2>chemicals when you were in there because</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

3346
02:32:58.520 --> 02:32:59.211
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going,</v>

3347
02:32:59.211 --> 02:33:00.480
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're dying.</v>

3348
02:33:00.490 --> 02:33:02.090
<v Speaker 2>The producers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cold shock proteins,</v>

3349
02:33:02.091 --> 02:33:06.140
<v Speaker 2>what they call them and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it also produces a nor epinephrin,</v>

3350
02:33:06.440 --> 02:33:08.960
<v Speaker 2>which is like a version of adrenaline</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

3351
02:33:08.961 --> 02:33:11.740
<v Speaker 2>or as a cousin of adrenaline.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that how they described it?</v>

3352
02:33:11.741 --> 02:33:12.501
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3353
02:33:12.501 --> 02:33:13.520
<v Speaker 2>Epinephrin is adrenaline.</v>

3354
02:33:13.560 --> 02:33:17.640
<v Speaker 3>Joey Diaz just did it the other day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is about the kind of air</v>

3355
02:33:17.641 --> 02:33:18.690
<v Speaker 3>conditioning I want in my house.</v>

3356
02:33:18.930 --> 02:33:22.460
<v Speaker 2>Ah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We would go into his hotel room when we</v>

3357
02:33:22.461 --> 02:33:25.000
<v Speaker 2>would go on the road with Joey and we'd</v>
<v Speaker 2>open up the door and be like,</v>

3358
02:33:25.001 --> 02:33:28.750
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ fucking penguins or waddled</v>
<v Speaker 2>around inside of his room,</v>

3359
02:33:28.780 --> 02:33:30.580
<v Speaker 2>50 degrees,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

3360
02:33:30.581 --> 02:33:33.190
<v Speaker 2>That when there was a slider and you can</v>
<v Speaker 2>get over to the blue,</v>

3361
02:33:33.310 --> 02:33:37.930
<v Speaker 2>that shit would be pegged like at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>coldest it could possibly get that thing</v>

3362
02:33:37.931 --> 02:33:39.400
<v Speaker 2>never shut off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3363
02:33:39.510 --> 02:33:44.510
<v Speaker 2>no it does in room ones that would kick</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the real loud and you're like,</v>

3364
02:33:44.530 --> 02:33:49.530
<v Speaker 2>no spray on you daughter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The worst is when they go on and off</v>

3365
02:33:49.661 --> 02:33:52.570
<v Speaker 2>intermittently in the night and wake you</v>
<v Speaker 2>up in the middle of the night.</v>

3366
02:33:55.030 --> 02:33:58.690
<v Speaker 2>When we were at the Detroit fillmore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were talking about how men used to</v>

3367
02:33:58.691 --> 02:34:00.590
<v Speaker 2>come in there during,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3368
02:34:00.591 --> 02:34:03.010
<v Speaker 2>like whatever the fuck year it was when</v>
<v Speaker 2>they invented this,</v>

3369
02:34:03.011 --> 02:34:05.710
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where they built this amazing theater in</v>

3370
02:34:05.711 --> 02:34:07.030
<v Speaker 2>Detroit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was the,</v>

3371
02:34:07.060 --> 02:34:09.130
<v Speaker 2>one of the first places in town,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've got air conditioning.</v>

3372
02:34:09.460 --> 02:34:13.690
<v Speaker 2>So people would buy a ticket just to</v>
<v Speaker 2>come in and sleep because it was so hot</v>

3373
02:34:13.691 --> 02:34:16.060
<v Speaker 2>in the summertime.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they'd go there and they'd be</v>

3374
02:34:16.061 --> 02:34:17.400
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ah.</v>

3375
02:34:17.730 --> 02:34:21.890
<v Speaker 2>He would just sit there</v>
<v Speaker 2>snore at,</v>

3376
02:34:21.940 --> 02:34:22.481
<v Speaker 2>that's how I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3377
02:34:22.481 --> 02:34:25.600
<v Speaker 2>my gym has 24 hour fitness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you have fucking homeless people will</v>

3378
02:34:25.601 --> 02:34:29.350
<v Speaker 2>live in their showers there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what people do,</v>

3379
02:34:29.351 --> 02:34:30.670
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they want to live out of their car,</v>

3380
02:34:30.671 --> 02:34:35.110
<v Speaker 2>they get a 24 hour fitness membership.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I like going late at night.</v>

3381
02:34:35.111 --> 02:34:38.050
<v Speaker 2>Like sometimes we'll go like at one in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the morning and then you just like,</v>

3382
02:34:38.051 --> 02:34:39.640
<v Speaker 2>why is there so many people here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3383
02:34:39.641 --> 02:34:43.220

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3385
02:34:43.950 --> 02:34:46.600
<v Speaker 2>Where do you sleep if you're homeless?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Car Cars.</v>

3386
02:34:46.830 --> 02:34:48.070

<v Speaker 2>but that's not,</v>

<v Speaker 5>guy who was an ultra marathon runner.</v>

<v Speaker 5>It's called the most elusive man in</v>

3396
02:35:04.861 --> 02:35:08.460
<v Speaker 5>North America.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And this dude has a school bus that he</v>

3397
02:35:08.461 --> 02:35:12.090
<v Speaker 5>lives in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He parked the school bus in the woods</v>

3398
02:35:12.300 --> 02:35:16.350
<v Speaker 5>and he just runs every day and they're</v>
<v Speaker 5>all like looking for this guy.</v>

3399
02:35:17.310 --> 02:35:22.290
<v Speaker 5>I want to say he's like 78 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Does it say</v>

3400
02:35:24.320 --> 02:35:28.890
<v Speaker 5>76 76 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's 76 years old and he runs ultra</v>

3401
02:35:28.891 --> 02:35:31.370
<v Speaker 5>marathons and this guy lives in the</v>
<v Speaker 5>forest.</v>

3402
02:35:31.371 --> 02:35:33.460
<v Speaker 5>You got to go way till they find them</v>
<v Speaker 5>these,</v>

3403
02:35:33.540 --> 02:35:36.960
<v Speaker 5>they had to go and seek this guy out and</v>
<v Speaker 5>do these interviews with him.</v>

3404
02:35:38.820 --> 02:35:43.820
<v Speaker 5>There he is right there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so all he does is drink beer and run</v>

3405
02:35:45.650 --> 02:35:48.240
<v Speaker 5>and eat food.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I think he lives by himself and he</v>

3406
02:35:48.241 --> 02:35:49.800
<v Speaker 5>lives in this tiny little thing.</v>

3407
02:35:50.040 --> 02:35:53.940
<v Speaker 5>And but what's fascinating is when you</v>
<v Speaker 5>talk to him,</v>

3408
02:35:54.420 --> 02:35:56.730
<v Speaker 5>when you sit and listen to the guy talk,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you'd go,</v>

3409
02:35:56.760 --> 02:36:01.470
<v Speaker 5>oh well this is a very intelligent man</v>
<v Speaker 5>and he just finds what he likes.</v>

3410
02:36:01.471 --> 02:36:05.070
<v Speaker 5>What he likes to do is create trails.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So he makes his own trails in the woods.</v>

3411
02:36:05.310 --> 02:36:08.140
<v Speaker 5>He knocks over sticks and move stuff</v>
<v Speaker 5>aside and,</v>

3412
02:36:08.220 --> 02:36:12.450
<v Speaker 5>and creates a path so that he could use</v>
<v Speaker 5>it over and over again and,</v>

3413
02:36:12.650 --> 02:36:15.840
<v Speaker 5>and just runs all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just constantly pushing himself.</v>

3414
02:36:15.841 --> 02:36:20.430
<v Speaker 5>But he's talking about challenging</v>
<v Speaker 5>himself in the things that he does.</v>

3415
02:36:20.431 --> 02:36:23.430
<v Speaker 5>And why does it mean he doesn't need</v>
<v Speaker 5>anything more than this bus to live in</v>

3416
02:36:23.760 --> 02:36:25.980
<v Speaker 5>and he's just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's not.</v>

3417
02:36:26.220 --> 02:36:28.110
<v Speaker 5>See the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you would see someone like that and you</v>

3418
02:36:28.111 --> 02:36:29.280
<v Speaker 5>dismiss them and you'd go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

3419
02:36:29.281 --> 02:36:31.410
<v Speaker 5>that guy is a fool,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he's not a fool.</v>

3420
02:36:31.560 --> 02:36:33.330
<v Speaker 5>And you listen to him talk and you go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

3421
02:36:33.600 --> 02:36:36.930
<v Speaker 5>so this is his philosophy behind this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>These got,</v>

3422
02:36:37.140 --> 02:36:40.830
<v Speaker 5>he's really thought this out to the</v>
<v Speaker 5>point where he's become very comfortable</v>

3423
02:36:40.831 --> 02:36:45.110
<v Speaker 5>just living in this bus in the middle of</v>
<v Speaker 5>the forest and he looks good for a guy</v>

3424
02:36:45.111 --> 02:36:48.270
<v Speaker 5>who's 76 who runs hundreds of miles.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3425
02:36:48.271 --> 02:36:49.680
<v Speaker 5>he looks sexy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Santa.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 5>he's going to enter in any bodybuilding</v>

3428
02:36:53.311 --> 02:36:56.100
<v Speaker 5>competitions,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he looks like a guy who's got</v>

3429
02:36:56.101 --> 02:36:57.180
<v Speaker 5>vitality.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3431
02:37:00.490 --> 02:37:05.490
<v Speaker 2>like a creepy old dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got a lot of time down on with that</v>

3432
02:37:06.271 --> 02:37:07.680
<v Speaker 2>skin.</v>

<v Speaker 5>British Columbia lives a 76 year old man</v>

3471
02:38:29.241 --> 02:38:32.810
<v Speaker 5>by the name of Dag Abi.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How do you say that?</v>

3472
02:38:33.500 --> 02:38:36.920
<v Speaker 5>Abi Dag Abby,</v>
<v Speaker 5>his no cell phone or email address</v>

3473
02:38:36.921 --> 02:38:40.160
<v Speaker 5>revered by locals for having escaped</v>
<v Speaker 5>from the shackles of modern society.</v>

3474
02:38:40.161 --> 02:38:42.440
<v Speaker 5>He's the champion of the 80 mile ultra</v>
<v Speaker 5>marathon,</v>

3475
02:38:42.470 --> 02:38:47.470
<v Speaker 5>aptly named the death race.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Abby is the oldest person to have ever</v>

3476
02:38:47.841 --> 02:38:48.890
<v Speaker 5>finished the race.</v>

3477
02:38:50.220 --> 02:38:50.620
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

3478
02:38:50.620 --> 02:38:53.140
<v Speaker 5>very fascinating man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But these,</v>

3479
02:38:53.141 --> 02:38:56.020
<v Speaker 5>here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the guy seems content.</v>

3480
02:38:56.410 --> 02:39:00.370
<v Speaker 5>How many 76 year olds do you run into</v>
<v Speaker 5>that are depressed,</v>

3481
02:39:00.880 --> 02:39:04.240
<v Speaker 5>that don't seem content,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that don't seem to have any vitality?</v>

3482
02:39:04.390 --> 02:39:07.750
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we have to accept what life is going to</v>

3483
02:39:07.751 --> 02:39:10.840
<v Speaker 5>give all of us.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it's a fucking an end where your</v>

3484
02:39:10.841 --> 02:39:12.910
<v Speaker 5>body's failing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you and I are starting to see that</v>

3485
02:39:12.911 --> 02:39:15.010
<v Speaker 5>now with our shit vision.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3486
02:39:15.090 --> 02:39:17.860
<v Speaker 5>I see it now with um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my,</v>

3487
02:39:17.861 --> 02:39:22.270
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my ability to recover from injuries like</v>

3488
02:39:22.271 --> 02:39:24.310
<v Speaker 5>special,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially this tendonitis of have this</v>

3489
02:39:24.311 --> 02:39:28.990
<v Speaker 5>tendonitis in my elbow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's really shocking because I never had</v>

3490
02:39:28.991 --> 02:39:31.660
<v Speaker 5>like real tendonitis before.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't know how long it takes.</v>

3491
02:39:31.780 --> 02:39:34.180
<v Speaker 5>I figured out it's like a pulled muscle.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Give it a couple of months,</v>

3492
02:39:34.181 --> 02:39:35.560
<v Speaker 5>we'll be all right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3493
02:39:35.710 --> 02:39:37.390
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A couple months later I still feel that</v>

3494
02:39:37.391 --> 02:39:39.130
<v Speaker 5>fucking thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've done a lot of shit to it.</v>

3495
02:39:39.130 --> 02:39:41.050
<v Speaker 5>To stem cells.</v>
<v Speaker 5>PRP,</v>

3496
02:39:41.051 --> 02:39:42.550
<v Speaker 5>Regena keen.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's getting better,</v>

3497
02:39:42.880 --> 02:39:47.020
<v Speaker 5>but shit is not quick to heal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It takes forever and you gotta be real</v>

3498
02:39:47.050 --> 02:39:50.140
<v Speaker 5>delicate with it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have that with my hands.</v>

3499
02:39:50.230 --> 02:39:52.600
<v Speaker 5>Also.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If I get out of shape now I get out of</v>

3500
02:39:52.601 --> 02:39:54.460
<v Speaker 5>shape.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It takes way longer to get back into</v>

3501
02:39:54.461 --> 02:39:56.590
<v Speaker 5>shape.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Takes like double the time.</v>

3502
02:39:57.280 --> 02:39:59.080
<v Speaker 5>Like um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when I did that,</v>

3503
02:39:59.081 --> 02:40:01.780
<v Speaker 5>a hot yoga challenge,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I hardly ever ran.</v>

3504
02:40:01.810 --> 02:40:05.050
<v Speaker 5>I didn't do any and I lost like a big</v>
<v Speaker 5>step.</v>

3505
02:40:05.350 --> 02:40:10.350
<v Speaker 5>It took me a solid two weeks to get back</v>
<v Speaker 5>to our was before doing yoga.</v>

3506
02:40:13.340 --> 02:40:14.173
<v Speaker 5>We're going,</v>

3507
02:40:14.460 --> 02:40:16.770
<v Speaker 1>it's going down just like that old man</v>
<v Speaker 1>living in the forest,</v>

3508
02:40:17.310 --> 02:40:19.800
<v Speaker 1>but he's got it right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He knows it's going down.</v>

3509
02:40:19.830 --> 02:40:22.760
<v Speaker 1>He's leaving behind nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jeremiah walking.</v>

3510
02:40:22.761 --> 02:40:25.170
<v Speaker 1>It's just lost all of the way that he</v>
<v Speaker 1>gained during that.</v>

3511
02:40:25.171 --> 02:40:26.970
<v Speaker 1>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it took them three months to lose it.</v>

3512
02:40:27.330 --> 02:40:30.230
<v Speaker 1>We should make Tony get fat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We should force feed them.</v>

3513
02:40:31.080 --> 02:40:33.690
<v Speaker 1>We feed them that you just can't get</v>
<v Speaker 1>fat.</v>

3514
02:40:33.691 --> 02:40:34.890
<v Speaker 1>He's one of those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3515
02:40:34.920 --> 02:40:38.280
<v Speaker 1>I think his whole life he's been had</v>
<v Speaker 1>that problem where he can eat as much as</v>

3516
02:40:38.281 --> 02:40:39.690
<v Speaker 1>you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He will never get fat.</v>

3517
02:40:40.350 --> 02:40:42.960
<v Speaker 1>That's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he will definitely get fat,</v>

3518
02:40:43.230 --> 02:40:45.960
<v Speaker 1>especially if each sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But Tony eats pretty healthy.</v>

3519
02:40:46.350 --> 02:40:48.780
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't eat a lot of sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't fuck around with anything</v>

3520
02:40:48.781 --> 02:40:50.010
<v Speaker 1>stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he'll,</v>

3521
02:40:50.011 --> 02:40:52.650
<v Speaker 1>he'll occasionally put like sugar in his</v>
<v Speaker 1>coffee or something like that,</v>

<v Speaker 2>good.</v>

3588
02:43:24.650 --> 02:43:27.040

<v Speaker 2>That might as well be a stationary store</v>

3589
02:43:27.041 --> 02:43:28.790
<v Speaker 2>to me when I pass by I'm like,</v>

3593
02:43:38.200 --> 02:43:40.060
<v Speaker 2>Mcdonald's fries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that it's,</v>

3594
02:43:40.061 --> 02:43:43.840
<v Speaker 2>in my world it's five guys and in and</v>
<v Speaker 2>out or basically neck and neck.</v>

3595
02:43:43.900 --> 02:43:46.720
<v Speaker 2>I bet if I didn't live around so many in</v>
<v Speaker 2>and outs,</v>

3596
02:43:46.990 --> 02:43:49.630
<v Speaker 2>I would prefer in and out more than I</v>
<v Speaker 2>do,</v>

3597
02:43:49.900 --> 02:43:53.410
<v Speaker 2>but I'm only around like a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 2>five guys or five guys has some novelty,</v>

3598
02:43:53.920 --> 02:43:56.260
<v Speaker 2>but five guys also has Jalapenos.</v>

3599
02:43:56.500 --> 02:43:59.890

<v Speaker 2>You don't like Wendy's as much as,</v>

3601
02:44:03.220 --> 02:44:04.780
<v Speaker 2>as much as in and out?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

3602
02:44:04.870 --> 02:44:06.100
<v Speaker 2>No chance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not as good.</v>

3603
02:44:06.130 --> 02:44:08.790
<v Speaker 2>If I were to take 10 burgers here in</v>
<v Speaker 2>blindfold,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I would know.</v>

3605
02:44:11.471 --> 02:44:14.560
<v Speaker 2>What's the difference you'd be able to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you just got it from a regular store,</v>

3606
02:44:14.800 --> 02:44:17.770
<v Speaker 2>you remember?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to do a joke about actors being a</v>

3607
02:44:17.771 --> 02:44:20.400
<v Speaker 2>lot like cheeseburgers cause he never</v>
<v Speaker 2>looked like their pictures,</v>

3608
02:44:22.690 --> 02:44:24.660
<v Speaker 2>especially actresses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3609
02:44:24.790 --> 02:44:29.790
<v Speaker 2>but you never get a cheeseburger from</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wendy's that doesn't look like it's been</v>

3610
02:44:29.981 --> 02:44:34.981
<v Speaker 2>stuffed into one of those fucking foil</v>
<v Speaker 2>things and press down pickles on the</v>

3611
02:44:35.111 --> 02:44:38.170
<v Speaker 2>side so it makes it fresh every time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh you're tricky.</v>

3612
02:44:38.410 --> 02:44:40.060
<v Speaker 2>Pickles on the side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tricky boy.</v>

3613
02:44:40.690 --> 02:44:43.810
<v Speaker 2>You sure they don't open that bitch up</v>
<v Speaker 2>and just take some pickles out there so</v>

3614
02:44:43.811 --> 02:44:45.580
<v Speaker 2>fast that Wendy's somehow that's a hack.</v>

3615
02:44:46.030 --> 02:44:49.630
<v Speaker 2>It's a hack the pickles on the side of</v>
<v Speaker 2>hack by writing their fats because</v>

<v Speaker 2>fuck with it.</v>

3620
02:44:58.600 --> 02:45:01.390
