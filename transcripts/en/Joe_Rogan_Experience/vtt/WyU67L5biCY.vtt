00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:01.640
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:02.211
<v Speaker 1>Oh you know,</v>

3
00:00:02.211 --> 00:00:02.530
<v Speaker 1>they've,</v>

4
00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:04.910
<v Speaker 1>they've done some really interesting studies work cause you know,</v>

5
00:00:04.911 --> 00:00:06.590
<v Speaker 1>they just over the last 10 or 15 years ago,</v>

6
00:00:06.591 --> 00:00:07.970
<v Speaker 1>we see inside the brain,</v>

7
00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:09.420
<v Speaker 1>I for the first time ever,</v>

8
00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:11.820
<v Speaker 1>they again these Fmr I and where do you see inside the brain?</v>

9
00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.980
<v Speaker 1>And they found people who've been identified as say this and they show them</v>

10
00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:20.390
<v Speaker 1>pictures of people being hurt intentionally and they're like happy joy centers</v>

11
00:00:20.391 --> 00:00:22.170
<v Speaker 1>light up their little like bring dancers.</v>

12
00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:24.470
<v Speaker 1>That's all messed up.</v>

13
00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:25.251
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

14
00:00:25.251 --> 00:00:26.690
<v Speaker 1>cause it's like opposite planet,</v>

15
00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:27.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

16
00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:28.010
<v Speaker 1>all things.</v>

17
00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:29.120
<v Speaker 1>We've got this thing from religion,</v>

18
00:00:29.121 --> 00:00:31.710
<v Speaker 1>like everyone has a soul and we're all kind of equal,</v>

19
00:00:31.711 --> 00:00:33.530
<v Speaker 1>all made in the image of God and this and that and the other.</v>

20
00:00:33.531 --> 00:00:34.850
<v Speaker 1>But it's according to this,</v>

21
00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:36.620
<v Speaker 1>people I've talked to in the research that I've done,</v>

22
00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:40.130
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's some real predators among us who really are not kind of like us</v>

23
00:00:40.131 --> 00:00:40.964
<v Speaker 1>at all.</v>

24
00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:43.720
<v Speaker 1>And it's somebody who likes cs,</v>

25
00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:44.031
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

26
00:00:44.031 --> 00:00:48.350
<v Speaker 1>some being driven over and he giggles and finds that really quite thrilling.</v>

27
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.610
<v Speaker 1>I mean that,</v>

28
00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:51.090
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know what species they have it.</v>

29
00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:53.900
<v Speaker 1>And I think they're alive and you're going out there that they make like kind of</v>

30
00:00:53.901 --> 00:00:54.860
<v Speaker 1>difficult for the rest of us.</v>

31
00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:56.091
<v Speaker 1>It's a real issue.</v>

32
00:00:56.091 --> 00:00:56.960
<v Speaker 1>It's very scary.</v>

33
00:00:56.961 --> 00:00:59.120
<v Speaker 1>And how are these people becoming that?</v>

34
00:00:59.121 --> 00:01:00.770
<v Speaker 1>Is it because of nature or nurture?</v>

35
00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.820
<v Speaker 1>Is it because of,</v>

36
00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:02.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

37
00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:02.590
<v Speaker 1>abusive,</v>

38
00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:05.390
<v Speaker 1>they've personally suffered and that sort of stimulating?</v>

39
00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

40
00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.740
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

41
00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.040
<v Speaker 1>so I mean this is the fascinating thing about epigenetics,</v>

42
00:01:10.041 --> 00:01:10.221
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

43
00:01:10.221 --> 00:01:10.881
<v Speaker 1>So I mean,</v>

44
00:01:10.881 --> 00:01:11.790
<v Speaker 1>when I was a kid growing up,</v>

45
00:01:11.791 --> 00:01:13.100
<v Speaker 1>but there was this nature versus nurture.</v>

46
00:01:13.101 --> 00:01:14.230
<v Speaker 1>Like you got your genes,</v>

47
00:01:14.231 --> 00:01:15.021
<v Speaker 1>that's what you're born with,</v>

48
00:01:15.021 --> 00:01:15.231
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

49
00:01:15.231 --> 00:01:16.970
<v Speaker 1>And then maybe you can influence it a bit with nature.</v>

50
00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.690
<v Speaker 1>But what they're finding out now is that genes turn on and off depending on</v>

51
00:01:20.691 --> 00:01:21.440
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>

52
00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.610
<v Speaker 1>So they found like if you have a particular gene and you're a boy and you are</v>

53
00:01:25.611 --> 00:01:27.050
<v Speaker 1>physically abused as a child,</v>

54
00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:28.441
<v Speaker 1>almost for certain,</v>

55
00:01:28.441 --> 00:01:29.274
<v Speaker 1>that you're going to end up,</v>

56
00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:29.811
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

57
00:01:29.811 --> 00:01:30.890
<v Speaker 1>on the bad side of things,</v>

58
00:01:30.891 --> 00:01:31.960
<v Speaker 1>like you're gonna end up violent,</v>

59
00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:33.590
<v Speaker 1>aggressive criminal j or whatever.</v>

60
00:01:33.591 --> 00:01:34.190
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

61
00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.341
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

62
00:01:34.341 --> 00:01:35.111
<v Speaker 1>if you don't have that gene,</v>

63
00:01:35.111 --> 00:01:35.620
<v Speaker 1>you're abused,</v>

64
00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:36.590
<v Speaker 1>you've likely heard,</v>

65
00:01:36.591 --> 00:01:37.424
<v Speaker 1>but it's less.</v>

66
00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.880
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

67
00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.090
<v Speaker 1>and so certain genes for aggression get turned down and strengthened based upon</v>

68
00:01:41.091 --> 00:01:41.721
<v Speaker 1>your experiences.</v>

69
00:01:41.721 --> 00:01:44.330
<v Speaker 1>You can end up deck twins who grew up in different households can end up with</v>

70
00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.250
<v Speaker 1>different genetics based on their environment.</v>

71
00:01:46.251 --> 00:01:48.740
<v Speaker 1>So that's what so important about,</v>

72
00:01:48.741 --> 00:01:48.921
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

73
00:01:48.921 --> 00:01:50.720
<v Speaker 1>something I focus a lot on is the parenting,</v>

74
00:01:50.721 --> 00:01:51.440
<v Speaker 1>parenting parents.</v>

75
00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.650
<v Speaker 1>It seems to be so many people are out there and they're just so messed up.</v>

76
00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:55.221
<v Speaker 1>Like you just,</v>

77
00:01:55.221 --> 00:01:57.890
<v Speaker 1>you can't rewind and you can't send them down a different path.</v>

78
00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:59.840
<v Speaker 1>But if you kind of look at the next generation,</v>

79
00:01:59.841 --> 00:02:00.674
<v Speaker 1>the next generation,</v>

80
00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.670
<v Speaker 1>what if we could have the percentage of people spanking their children down from</v>

81
00:02:04.671 --> 00:02:05.451
<v Speaker 1>90%.</v>

82
00:02:05.451 --> 00:02:05.871
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

83
00:02:05.871 --> 00:02:09.470
<v Speaker 1>it seems so weird and the 21st century that that's how parents are really</v>

84
00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:10.313
<v Speaker 1>focused,</v>

85
00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:12.290
<v Speaker 1>depending on where you counted.</v>

86
00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:13.280
<v Speaker 1>80 to 90%.</v>

87
00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:14.270
<v Speaker 1>It's less so in Europe,</v>

88
00:02:14.271 --> 00:02:15.230
<v Speaker 1>like in Sweden,</v>

89
00:02:15.231 --> 00:02:17.720
<v Speaker 1>I think it's been banned since like 1973.</v>

90
00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.680
<v Speaker 1>And y'all know what a hell hole Sweden is.</v>

91
00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.963
<v Speaker 1>They're doing fine.</v>

92
00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:22.220
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

93
00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.431
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

94
00:02:22.431 --> 00:02:23.860
<v Speaker 1>it's still 80 to 90% in,</v>

95
00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:24.500
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

96
00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:25.333
<v Speaker 1>well it's legal here.</v>

97
00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.770
<v Speaker 1>It's legal in America from two to 12.</v>

98
00:02:27.771 --> 00:02:29.510
<v Speaker 1>You can hit a child in Canada illegally,</v>

99
00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.490
<v Speaker 1>just not of the face and not with an implement.</v>

100
00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.863
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

101
00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:33.430
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

102
00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.601
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

103
00:02:33.601 --> 00:02:36.430
<v Speaker 2>I care about is the opponent in front of me and uh,</v>

104
00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:37.623
<v Speaker 2>and that fight,</v>

105
00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:38.020
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

106
00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:39.200
<v Speaker 2>I don't do anything to,</v>

107
00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.260
<v Speaker 2>to go out there and lose man,</v>

108
00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.831
<v Speaker 2>fuck that.</v>

109
00:02:41.831 --> 00:02:43.620
<v Speaker 2>And I go out there to go to war and,</v>

110
00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.730
<v Speaker 2>and be the nastiest Munis individual I can be.</v>

111
00:02:46.731 --> 00:02:51.100
<v Speaker 2>And I view the fight as the most important thing and everything else is,</v>

112
00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.700
<v Speaker 2>if I was thinking about the things surrounding the fight and in and separating</v>

113
00:02:58.361 --> 00:02:59.920
<v Speaker 2>that from the flight was more,</v>

114
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.030
<v Speaker 2>that would be more difficult for me to navigate because that's also not</v>

115
00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:05.800
<v Speaker 2>necessarily all within my control,</v>

116
00:03:05.801 --> 00:03:07.870
<v Speaker 2>but the full kind of thing specifically,</v>

117
00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.531
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

118
00:03:08.531 --> 00:03:08.771
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

119
00:03:08.771 --> 00:03:10.950
<v Speaker 2>you've got your media days and this and what you should say,</v>

120
00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

121
00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:15.070
<v Speaker 2>what you're trying to do and maybe getting this sponsor all these different</v>

122
00:03:15.071 --> 00:03:16.030
<v Speaker 2>little things that have,</v>

123
00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:16.923
<v Speaker 2>that are not,</v>

124
00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:21.400
<v Speaker 2>that are not directly a controllable by you or she can get in the way.</v>

125
00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.090
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

126
00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.181
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

127
00:03:22.181 --> 00:03:22.841
<v Speaker 2>of course it can,</v>

128
00:03:22.841 --> 00:03:23.980
<v Speaker 2>but I separate the two.</v>

129
00:03:23.981 --> 00:03:25.060
<v Speaker 2>I keep them completely,</v>

130
00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:26.230
<v Speaker 2>entirely separate.</v>

131
00:03:26.231 --> 00:03:29.740
<v Speaker 2>And at the end of the day I will throw away everything that is not the fight.</v>

132
00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:31.780
<v Speaker 2>The fight is what gets you what you want.</v>

133
00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:32.201
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

134
00:03:32.201 --> 00:03:34.060
<v Speaker 2>I always say over and over again,</v>

135
00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:35.163
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>

136
00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:39.340
<v Speaker 2>if there is nobody left alive to stop you from taking what you want,</v>

137
00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:40.240
<v Speaker 2>then you,</v>

138
00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.780
<v Speaker 2>you can have all the trophies and trinkets and all that stuff.</v>

139
00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:44.770
<v Speaker 2>Then everything is left.</v>

140
00:03:44.771 --> 00:03:45.820
<v Speaker 2>It's the spoils of war.</v>

141
00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:49.210
<v Speaker 2>So go out and win your war and then deal with the rest later.</v>

142
00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:50.530
<v Speaker 2>There's an article about it online.</v>

143
00:03:50.531 --> 00:03:51.000
<v Speaker 2>It says,</v>

144
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.290
<v Speaker 3>Janice,</v>

145
00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:53.790
<v Speaker 3>Stan's male soldiers are having sex with other guys,</v>

146
00:03:53.791 --> 00:03:55.320
<v Speaker 3>but don't call them homos.</v>

147
00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:57.510
<v Speaker 3>Well there was also something where like,</v>

148
00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:58.553
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>

149
00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.380
<v Speaker 3>they were like their soldiers.</v>

150
00:04:01.381 --> 00:04:04.080
<v Speaker 3>They would have a young boy who would have to service everybody,</v>

151
00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:06.270
<v Speaker 3>check this and they had to tell the soldiers,</v>

152
00:04:06.271 --> 00:04:07.620
<v Speaker 3>don't get upset about that.</v>

153
00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:09.060
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

154
00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:09.990
<v Speaker 3>don't get involved.</v>

155
00:04:09.991 --> 00:04:10.980
<v Speaker 3>That's their custom.</v>

156
00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.020
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>

157
00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:16.140
<v Speaker 3>Well we know their customers that the young girl that died,</v>

158
00:04:16.141 --> 00:04:18.000
<v Speaker 3>she was sold away way to marriage.</v>

159
00:04:18.001 --> 00:04:18.840
<v Speaker 3>She was eight years old.</v>

160
00:04:18.841 --> 00:04:20.490
<v Speaker 3>She died after having sex with a guy.</v>

161
00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.070
<v Speaker 3>Let's listen to this Afghanistan's will the,</v>

162
00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.310
<v Speaker 3>the article is in a query,</v>

163
00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:27.210
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

164
00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:30.120
<v Speaker 3>free of an agenda except that gay one,</v>

165
00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:35.520
<v Speaker 3>queerty.com queer like instead of Cordy Queerty how Ha Alex every day when they</v>

166
00:04:35.521 --> 00:04:36.354
<v Speaker 3>got that domain</v>

167
00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:38.281
<v Speaker 3>as I love,</v>

168
00:04:38.281 --> 00:04:40.000
<v Speaker 3>I love the title to a free of agenda.</v>

169
00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:41.341
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

170
00:04:41.341 --> 00:04:42.010
<v Speaker 3>go ahead.</v>

171
00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:42.840
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

172
00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.610
<v Speaker 3>and it's talking about a,</v>

173
00:04:44.611 --> 00:04:46.050
<v Speaker 3>it says Afghanistan's mail.</v>

174
00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:47.370
<v Speaker 3>Sir soldiers have a sex,</v>

175
00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:48.540
<v Speaker 3>have sex with other guys,</v>

176
00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:49.850
<v Speaker 3>but don't call them homos.</v>

177
00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:50.693
<v Speaker 3>And it says,</v>

178
00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:51.631
<v Speaker 3>it's really interesting.</v>

179
00:04:51.631 --> 00:04:54.090
<v Speaker 3>It says America's gay soldiers have unique struggle in their hands,</v>

180
00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:57.240
<v Speaker 3>whether the hide or be open about their sexuality.</v>

181
00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:02.370
<v Speaker 3>But Afghanistan's gay soldiers have a different battle despite regularly having</v>

182
00:05:02.371 --> 00:05:05.250
<v Speaker 3>sex with other men and shunning women.</v>

183
00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:09.990
<v Speaker 3>Many of these male soldiers refused to identify as gay,</v>

184
00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:12.240
<v Speaker 3>which can get in the way of say,</v>

185
00:05:12.241 --> 00:05:13.590
<v Speaker 3>preventing STDs.</v>

186
00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:19.100
<v Speaker 3>You need only watched the CNN clip below where three gay American troops speak</v>

187
00:05:19.501 --> 00:05:20.850
<v Speaker 3>of the need to repeal,</v>

188
00:05:20.851 --> 00:05:21.331
<v Speaker 3>don't ask,</v>

189
00:05:21.331 --> 00:05:21.901
<v Speaker 3>don't tell,</v>

190
00:05:21.901 --> 00:05:23.160
<v Speaker 3>which has been repealed.</v>

191
00:05:23.161 --> 00:05:27.270
<v Speaker 3>Now I believe to understand the difficulties of being gay in the US armed forces</v>

192
00:05:27.271 --> 00:05:27.391
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>

193
00:05:27.391 --> 00:05:30.700
<v Speaker 3>The oldest article is from man love.</v>

194
00:05:30.701 --> 00:05:33.060
<v Speaker 3>Thursdays has its own post on urban dictionary.</v>

195
00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:34.980
<v Speaker 3>It's a the article,</v>

196
00:05:34.981 --> 00:05:36.480
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't say where it's from here.</v>

197
00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:40.350
<v Speaker 3>Unfortunately it doesn't say what year.</v>

198
00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:42.240
<v Speaker 3>So it was before.</v>

199
00:05:42.241 --> 00:05:42.661
<v Speaker 3>Don't ask,</v>

200
00:05:42.661 --> 00:05:43.980
<v Speaker 3>don't tell was repelled.</v>

201
00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:45.690
<v Speaker 3>So I don't,</v>

202
00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:46.110
<v Speaker 3>hmm.</v>

203
00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:46.943
<v Speaker 3>Repealed rather.</v>

204
00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:47.670
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

205
00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:48.690
<v Speaker 3>for these Afghan soldiers.</v>

206
00:05:48.691 --> 00:05:48.961
<v Speaker 3>However,</v>

207
00:05:48.961 --> 00:05:51.660
<v Speaker 3>having sex regularly with other men is no big deal.</v>

208
00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:55.740
<v Speaker 3>Just don't call them gay and unclassified study from military research unit in</v>

209
00:05:55.741 --> 00:05:56.850
<v Speaker 3>southern Afghanistan.</v>

210
00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:58.880
<v Speaker 3>That's a funny statement.</v>

211
00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.230
<v Speaker 3>An unclassified study from a military research unit in southern Afghanistan</v>

212
00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:06.950
<v Speaker 3>that's looking into gay sex details,</v>

213
00:06:06.951 --> 00:06:11.210
<v Speaker 3>how homosexual behavior is unusually common amongst men,</v>

214
00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:16.300
<v Speaker 3>among men in the large ethnic group known as Pash Dunes,</v>

215
00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:19.520
<v Speaker 3>PA ash t you ends Pashtuns,</v>

216
00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:23.750
<v Speaker 3>although they seem to be in complete denial about it.</v>

217
00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:26.990
<v Speaker 3>What's a new unclassified study of past June meant,</v>

218
00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:27.411
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

219
00:06:27.411 --> 00:06:27.890
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

220
00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:28.701
<v Speaker 3>that's what the new,</v>

221
00:06:28.701 --> 00:06:29.420
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

222
00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:32.150
<v Speaker 3>unclassified study revealed these men admire.</v>

223
00:06:32.151 --> 00:06:37.151
<v Speaker 3>Other men physically have sexual relationships with boys and shun women both</v>

224
00:06:37.341 --> 00:06:38.900
<v Speaker 3>socially and sexually.</v>

225
00:06:38.901 --> 00:06:42.350
<v Speaker 3>Yet they completely reject the label of homosexual.</v>

226
00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:48.080
<v Speaker 3>The research was conducted as part of a longstanding effort to better understand</v>

227
00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:51.830
<v Speaker 3>Afghan culture and improve western interaction with the local people.</v>

228
00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:54.570
<v Speaker 3>When you reach it like that and you read that,</v>

229
00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:55.220
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

230
00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:56.420
<v Speaker 3>people are dying over there.</v>

231
00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:57.231
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

232
00:06:57.231 --> 00:06:57.481
<v Speaker 3>and you,</v>

233
00:06:57.481 --> 00:06:59.630
<v Speaker 3>you think like the idea that they're going to try to change this.</v>

234
00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:00.351
<v Speaker 3>You think about what they do,</v>

235
00:07:00.351 --> 00:07:01.041
<v Speaker 3>where they marry off.</v>

236
00:07:01.041 --> 00:07:03.620
<v Speaker 3>Eight year old girls cut women's noses off.</v>

237
00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:05.360
<v Speaker 3>They do this kind of shit.</v>

238
00:07:05.361 --> 00:07:06.240
<v Speaker 3>Pretend they're not gay,</v>

239
00:07:06.241 --> 00:07:09.620
<v Speaker 3>whether fucking each other and be homophobic at the same time.</v>

240
00:07:09.621 --> 00:07:12.590
<v Speaker 3>It's absolute madness.</v>

241
00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:15.050
<v Speaker 3>It's reality your way right away.</v>

242
00:07:15.051 --> 00:07:16.730
<v Speaker 3>It's like custom made reality.</v>

243
00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:18.081
<v Speaker 3>This is what they do.</v>

244
00:07:18.081 --> 00:07:20.150
<v Speaker 3>This is how they figured out their way around it.</v>

245
00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:25.510
<v Speaker 3>The pash Dune men interpret the Islamic prohibition on homosexuality to mean</v>

246
00:07:26.271 --> 00:07:28.700
<v Speaker 3>they cannot love another man,</v>

247
00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:32.750
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't mean they can't use men for sexual gratification.</v>

248
00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:35.040
<v Speaker 3>What an interesting little gray area there.</v>

249
00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:37.640
<v Speaker 3>There's a little fine print right there.</v>

250
00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:07.680
<v Speaker 3>You're a fucking human being.</v>
