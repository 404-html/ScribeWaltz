1
00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:04.710
Man.
You're good.
No.
[inaudible] everybody.

2
00:00:04.711 --> 00:00:08.490
This is a fight companion.
If you've never listened to one before.

3
00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.530
We try to follow along with the fights,

4
00:00:10.531 --> 00:00:13.530
but you never know where it's going to go.
Our captain of the ship,

5
00:00:13.531 --> 00:00:18.531
Joe Rogan is in Vegas at UFC one 89 possibly the biggest UFC ever according to

6
00:00:18.721 --> 00:00:22.400
Joe.
Is that right?
I say UFC 100 but what can you do?

7
00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:27.530
What can you do?
Yeah,
sorry man.
We're 89 UFC.
It's away from that time.

8
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:32.710
We got a squad here tonight.
I'm excited for this one.
The Kid Cowen,

9
00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.680
Bobby,
Bobby,
Bobby Lee's.
Your nickname,
if you a fighter.
Bobby.
Oh,

10
00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:42.600
uh,
hey.
Yellow scallop yellow.
Scally Yay.
Yeah,
Dude.

11
00:00:42.601 --> 00:00:46.530
That's because it's like,
I'm like a yellow fat.
You know me in person.
I know,

12
00:00:46.531 --> 00:00:50.040
but like I have no formation.
Like I'm just feet formless,

13
00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.680
but that doesn't sound very menacing.
If you were to like and Bobby,

14
00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.470
scary yellow scallop,
I don't know.
Scallop.

15
00:00:58.471 --> 00:01:02.850
I want to see SSC.
Yeah,
but what would be your technique?

16
00:01:02.851 --> 00:01:06.660
Would you just be so amorphous that when you got hit like on my back and then I

17
00:01:06.661 --> 00:01:11.420
bend over and then they just fuck me in the behind?
Well,
no,
a

18
00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.690
porno set mode is,
although a lot of times guys get,

19
00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.280
they sleep after they're done a different instructor then.

20
00:01:20.281 --> 00:01:22.920
Cause that was the movie taught me.
I think your nickname should be Bobby.

21
00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.200
Yeah.
Oh No,
that's racist.

22
00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.630
I said come back to,
you know,
say you go.
How do we need to,
hey no,

23
00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:38.040
I would assume in this room,

24
00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.610
the person who knows probably the second most about the UFC is your girlfriend.

25
00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:48.030
Khalilah passive participant.
I'm just going to chime in,
you know,
here and there.

26
00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:51.810
It's always nice to have a nice voice on the mic.
That's for Kalina.

27
00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.620
Your job is also,
besides me.
I mean obviously I'm good looking man,

28
00:01:55.621 --> 00:01:57.400
but it just got a lot better.
Yeah.

29
00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.360
I want to talk about who you think is the sexiest fighter in this,

30
00:02:00.361 --> 00:02:03.510
in this whole group as you watch the fights.
Oh sure.

31
00:02:03.511 --> 00:02:06.270
I can do that is a little bit weird.

32
00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:14.430
Whoa.
Why'd you laugh so hard?
Hey,
whoa,
whoa,
whoa.
The artists,

33
00:02:14.431 --> 00:02:18.540
dude,
I'm with your brother.
Yeah,
she's into,
I mean,

34
00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.650
I can't help the way God made me.
No,
I think you're a good looking dude.

35
00:02:22.651 --> 00:02:26.310
There's nothing I could do with this.
You shouldn't it umbrella.

36
00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.660
I think you look good.
Wait,
let me see.
You pulled an attractive lady.

37
00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.990
What you pulled into the tractive ladies who didn't,
you know,
I,
you know,

38
00:02:33.991 --> 00:02:35.340
she's a very attractive and she's like,

39
00:02:35.341 --> 00:02:37.980
she's a good spirit and she has a great heart,
you know?

40
00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.250
And also we met on Tinder and I wanted to have that true.
Yeah.

41
00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.350
I wanted to have sexual intercourse with her first.

42
00:02:43.351 --> 00:02:45.810
But then I realized that I loved her.

43
00:02:45.811 --> 00:02:50.760
So then we had gotten into a relationship point of pride there that we met on

44
00:02:50.761 --> 00:02:54.060
Tinder and I think it cheapens the entire relationship.
I disagree.

45
00:02:54.061 --> 00:02:56.970
It's 2015 it's Tinder.
It's,
it's a hookup APP.

46
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000
It's not like match.com going to say you're very hot and I have a small penis

47
00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.490
when you're wearing the red Bandana.
And it makes me furious.

48
00:03:06.491 --> 00:03:10.090
But I also want to go with a Bandana headband,
the head thing.

49
00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.950
What are you doing?
Is that for sweat in your,
I don't know man.
My,
I don't know.

50
00:03:14.951 --> 00:03:18.010
My hair is long.
It's uncontrollable even though,
cause I put it on.
Oh,

51
00:03:18.011 --> 00:03:20.050
you sound like you had good.
He's suddenly got a Korean accent.

52
00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:25.960
Uncle Brian,

53
00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:27.430
you know your boy Matt Brown,

54
00:03:27.431 --> 00:03:31.420
one tonight sweats to be fight of the night against the dirty bird.

55
00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:36.370
He already fought.
Yeah man,
I didn't know I missed
the prelim.

56
00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:38.650
Yeah.
So during the fight campaigns,

57
00:03:38.651 --> 00:03:41.280
I feel like reaching across this and strangling during the fight means it's the

58
00:03:41.281 --> 00:03:45.070
only the paper view percent.
Dammit.
So hold on,
hold please.

59
00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:48.700
So Mack brown dirty,
he was a heck of a fight.

60
00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:52.870
Not fight of the night with a heck of a right there.
That right there.

61
00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:56.980
How long did it last?
Uh,
it was late in the first round.
There's like,

62
00:03:56.981 --> 00:03:59.970
I think a minute or 30 seconds left for break.
Jamie.
Yeah,

63
00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:03.580
that's a big win for Matt Brown.
Huge win.
I mean he's ranked number five.

64
00:04:03.581 --> 00:04:08.020
I don't think two means is ranked,
but still match up wise Jesus.
Huge win.
Yeah.

65
00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:09.580
Do you think that's psychological?

66
00:04:09.581 --> 00:04:12.470
Do you see that pre fight thing where they were on stage together and then like

67
00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:16.390
the other guy when they're weighing?
All right baby.
All right.
The way in,

68
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.220
I've got to ask that question the way it's been,

69
00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:24.300
but you know how when you get into somebody's mindset if you like are like crazy

70
00:04:24.461 --> 00:04:29.370
up there?
No,
no,
because you know,
I see the guy put his hand on his hip,

71
00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.680
Robbie Lawler's face like that.
It does nothing.
It does nothing.

72
00:04:32.681 --> 00:04:35.650
It's all for show to hype.
The fight.
I would cry.
And so everybody,

73
00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:39.820
everybody there knows there,
I mean no one's done that nothing's,

74
00:04:39.821 --> 00:04:42.580
no one's worried about anything.
Literally.
It's like what?

75
00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:45.220
You just want to wait and get out of there cause you know you're one day closer

76
00:04:45.221 --> 00:04:48.010
to the fight.
Yeah.
That's when it things get real.
That's when you're like,

77
00:04:48.011 --> 00:04:51.730
oh there's no turning back now.
That's where you get nervous.
Yeah.
Dan Brennan,

78
00:04:51.731 --> 00:04:55.680
he's going to fight Andrea Laski and Andrea Lusk.
He's a monster.

79
00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:58.270
He's fighting for the title and bread and being and by the way,

80
00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:02.320
bees hairier than Callan.
Yeah.
And he said,
I said,
how are you feeling?

81
00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:07.300
And Brendan goes scared and that's all he said.
I was like Jesus,

82
00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:11.700
that's,
that's honesty right there.
Cause I still wear the mouth guard with the,

83
00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:16.220
with the fangs.
He's one of my favorite fighters.
Yeah he does.
Yeah.

84
00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:19.120
I was on the wrestling team in high school.

85
00:05:19.121 --> 00:05:22.170
I used to get really nervous before meets and stuff.
Hell yeah.
Really nervous.

86
00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.250
Anything one on one even.

87
00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:27.130
I'm sure you got nervous before you do stand up when you started,

88
00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:27.993
when you first started out.

89
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.330
But the lesson was still more nerve wracking for me because I was a kid.

90
00:05:31.331 --> 00:05:34.120
I didn't know how to deal with that kind of pressure.
It really,
yeah man.

91
00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:39.040
Cause horrible.
I'll tell you what I am digging is the new layout of the UFC.

92
00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:44.290
The design,
it's a lot.
Everything's a lot cleaner.
Like the graphics are cleaner.

93
00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:47.820
It's a lot more professional.
I liked that you,
you'll see when the,

94
00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:49.910
cause it's the,
so just let everyone know.

95
00:05:49.911 --> 00:05:53.500
So this is the first night that the guys are wearing the Reebok kits as they

96
00:05:53.501 --> 00:05:55.870
call them.
So there you can't have any other sponsors.

97
00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:58.340
The fighters have to these designated

98
00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:01.220
<v 1>Reebok kits.
So everything looks a lot cleaner off.</v>

99
00:06:01.221 --> 00:06:03.620
See the graphics are a lot cleaner.
I love the look.

100
00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:08.690
What I don't like is the octagon looks like a NASCAR now.

101
00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:12.580
So now the fighters look cleaner,
but the octagon is dirtier in the arts.

102
00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:16.640
All the ads on the wait,
wait,
TC locked again.
There's,
there's liberty 10 spot,

103
00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:18.800
there's ads everywhere,
but then the filers super clean.

104
00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:21.830
So the only issue I have with that,
I love the whole look of the UFC.

105
00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:24.590
I'm actually nightmare mad at the kids cause it's super clean looking.

106
00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:28.700
But now the AUC gun looks dirty and then when you have all those sponsors,

107
00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:31.820
no one's seen any of that money.
The fighters aren't seeing the money.

108
00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:32.960
So for the UFC it's great.

109
00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:36.770
Before the guys with the talent inside.com they're not seeing any of that.

110
00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:40.190
That's the issue I have.
Right.
But I'm sure at times a change,
however,

111
00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:44.150
the look I approve.
Surprisingly,
I approve.

112
00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:47.080
I thought people were and thing I was going to hate on it.
Not at all actually.

113
00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:50.150
Like the cleaner look,
it looks more like the NFL or Nhl,

114
00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:54.760
which is what they're going for.
I get supports growing and uh,

115
00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:59.540
know here it is.
Look it.
Look it.
Mr Picot people are crunk for this flight.

116
00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:03.290
Pretty crunk.
I,
he um,
I hung out with him.

117
00:07:03.291 --> 00:07:07.280
He came to my show in Florida with Jaguar guavas and some,
uh,

118
00:07:07.281 --> 00:07:11.780
and Matt Brown and Mike Brown is your friend now.
Are you gonna say I was,

119
00:07:11.781 --> 00:07:15.050
I was loving it because he's not a big guy,
but he dresses very well.

120
00:07:15.051 --> 00:07:18.260
He was wearing a hat,
a hat on,
right.
Had it had it,
had a beautiful,

121
00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:22.030
beautiful polo on and I think it was a pink polo and I was like so low.

122
00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:25.370
There's a small Badass,
not afraid to wear a pink Polo.

123
00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:27.060
I was very impressed with him and it was a,

124
00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:30.080
I was in first class helps with employer Gracie.
Ooh.

125
00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:32.750
And then when we landed in New York,
I asked him for a hug and he hugged me.

126
00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:34.580
Really?
It was a cooler,

127
00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:36.950
but I didn't say anything the whole flight because it's sort of intimidated,

128
00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:40.130
you know,
if it was Hixon I would,
I would have not said anything at all.

129
00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:42.560
But it was heuler he's,
you know,
he's gentler.

130
00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:47.730
Luckily I saw Hixson Hixson his time piece at Siff Pacific Greens about 10 years

131
00:07:47.871 --> 00:07:51.260
ago.
I couldn't understand how it was that good looking look like a superhero.

132
00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:54.380
And I said,
I didn't know what to say.
So I go a hex and high.

133
00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:57.930
I used to train with hand.
So,
and you said it like that?
Yeah,

134
00:07:57.931 --> 00:08:00.710
he could probably give us the most,
he was handsome.
Okay.

135
00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:07.490
Okay.
Beat it has be it pimp along,
don't they?
Or they don't?

136
00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.420
Uh,
I don't know exactly the ratio.
I'm sure.
I'm sure.

137
00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:15.740
Hickson's a beast.
He's a beast deuce.
He's reached by the best looking one.

138
00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:19.190
Let's be honest.
Let's be honest.
Him or Henner.
Why was it good looking?

139
00:08:19.191 --> 00:08:22.730
Did you see it headed to study?
Of course.
I'm not saying studs.

140
00:08:22.731 --> 00:08:25.190
I'm saying good luck.
Your grace.
A Henna.
C'Mon Henderson.

141
00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:29.610
Six four with a Calvin Klein.
I six five probably killed about six five six,
five.

142
00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:31.900
Who Do you guys can the best looking guy off?
UFC is,

143
00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:35.000
who's the best looking guy now you'll crack hold a brand shops up there.

144
00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:39.810
I don't know if I'm up there.
Top three pretty pretty.

145
00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:44.790
It's not like
you're a hot dude.
Brooks brother.

146
00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:46.880
He looks like a 1950 is doorman

147
00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:52.670
Detroit and then I think I can say that 100% Puerto Rican.

148
00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:55.590
I looked like I wrangled tigers.
That's what I look.
Watch

149
00:08:58.630 --> 00:09:02.070
<v 0>TV.
Yeah.
Maybe you need a mustache.
You look like if you had a mustache.</v>

150
00:09:02.071 --> 00:09:04.590
He look like one of those 1920 strong men.

151
00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:12.570
Yeah.
I like to go the old school here.
Cut.

152
00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:15.990
I like the Great Gatsby to what inspired this?

153
00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:18.750
I want to say that unless you're chuck by Dell,

154
00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:22.590
you're not allowed to have a Mohawk who,
this is not this guy,
his trainer,
Bro.

155
00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:25.320
If you're 40 you can't have a Mohawk.
You just can't.
I agree.

156
00:09:25.321 --> 00:09:28.680
Unless you're chuckling.
Roy McDonald goes with the same haircut.

157
00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:31.830
I'll tell you what,
as far as marketing goes,
not feeling that haircut.

158
00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:34.890
Roy and Roy is my boy and you know,
and you know marketing.
What?
Why,

159
00:09:34.891 --> 00:09:37.710
why do you not like that for him?
He's clean.
You want them clean cut.

160
00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:42.210
Like clean cut or you know Roy dresses well speaks well he's a little

161
00:09:42.211 --> 00:09:45.090
introverted but you know he speaks.
Wow Man.

162
00:09:45.091 --> 00:09:49.470
So why not do it up with the hair man?
Grow it.
Brad Pickett.

163
00:09:49.471 --> 00:09:51.630
This dressed like flee.
I don't like it.
Yeah.

164
00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:57.330
He plays Bass for a band that is flea.
Yeah.
Yeah.
He doubles his Brad Pickett.

165
00:09:57.331 --> 00:10:01.860
He didn't.
I'll tell you what though.
This little dude can punch.
He can hit.

166
00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:06.840
Yes.
He can box his ass off.
Well he starts,
I guess that was his first discipline.

167
00:10:06.841 --> 00:10:11.610
Boxing.
Yeah.
Tiny little dude.
He's a small guy.
Like those Reebok kids.

168
00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:14.850
What do you think?
Ah,
I don't mind him.
Um,
I don't,

169
00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:18.990
I don't really have a strong opinion.
No,
I'm liking Mike Brown's beard.

170
00:10:19.830 --> 00:10:23.520
That guy,
that former WC world champion,

171
00:10:23.830 --> 00:10:26.870
he was a stud back in the day and true stud superseding.

172
00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:31.670
It reminds me of communism,
that the colors and stuff and the,
and the kids.
Well,

173
00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:34.920
and the way you're not far off the mark because if you have to wear something,

174
00:10:34.921 --> 00:10:38.760
the fighters no longer it can be sponsored.
Right.
So they can't wear sponsors.

175
00:10:38.770 --> 00:10:42.500
Nate.
There money isn't as,
they don't make any money anymore.
Right.
Stuff.

176
00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:47.400
How about that cut man utility vest those guys have on where I didn't see it.

177
00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:52.200
Oh Wow.
Cause they used to have their own stuff.
Right.

178
00:10:52.201 --> 00:10:54.180
Stitch used to definitely have his own stuff.

179
00:10:54.690 --> 00:10:58.140
Stitch is a little stitch might be more famous than a lot of fighters.

180
00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:01.500
The cut man stitch you see mean Klitschkos corner and you see him everyone's

181
00:11:01.501 --> 00:11:05.090
corner.
Let's go fight without stitch.
You know that?
Yeah.

182
00:11:05.130 --> 00:11:09.930
Stitches his stitches.
The cut man.
That's a human being stitch.

183
00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.010
Yeah.
Yeah,
yeah.
His real name's uh,
I think a stitch Duran.

184
00:11:14.011 --> 00:11:18.690
I don't know his real first name,
but he's like the nicest guy ever.
He works.

185
00:11:18.691 --> 00:11:20.070
He works with the best of the best.

186
00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:22.410
Like there's some guys will schedule their fights around.

187
00:11:22.411 --> 00:11:27.330
So stitching Klitschkos one of them.
Now you walk out here,
your,

188
00:11:27.331 --> 00:11:29.670
your emotions are all over the place,
right?
No,

189
00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:32.340
here you're good because here you're good.

190
00:11:32.341 --> 00:11:37.140
You touched gloves and it's just this go Tesco almost in cruise control.
For me,

191
00:11:37.141 --> 00:11:40.620
I would just need to get like three minutes past the first round and I'm good.

192
00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:44.130
Right to three.
But trouble before then.
Cause you're,
you're so nervous,

193
00:11:44.131 --> 00:11:46.500
you know you're making,
you can kind of make mistakes.

194
00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:48.450
You can see the pros kind of chill out.

195
00:11:48.451 --> 00:11:50.910
They calmed down and they feel it out a little bit.

196
00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:54.040
Heavyweights is really no feeling out.
Can I ask you something?

197
00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:58.400
<v 1>Do you know,
do you know your mom inches by?
I already know I googled it,
but uh,</v>

198
00:11:58.450 --> 00:12:01.390
do you know where your mom and your girlfriend and stuff are when you're in the

199
00:12:01.391 --> 00:12:02.920
ring or no,
not a clue.

200
00:12:05.810 --> 00:12:10.210
I frills.
I know where Brian's at.
That's it.
Really?
Yeah.
Yeah.

201
00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:13.000
Oh that's weird.
I wouldn't know.
Like I would be like in my head,

202
00:12:13.001 --> 00:12:17.530
like mom's on the third row lives.
I have no idea.
You can't think that way.

203
00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:18.920
Why?
And I,
and,

204
00:12:18.930 --> 00:12:22.570
and I would imagine you're the bulk of the nerves is that you just want to

205
00:12:22.571 --> 00:12:24.820
perform well.
It's not about getting hurt,
you know,
you,

206
00:12:24.821 --> 00:12:26.420
I don't even think about getting hurt.
I just want to,

207
00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:28.450
when I'm more nervous about losing this.

208
00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:32.290
But do you know you're losing when you're losing?
No.
I always think I was every,

209
00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:36.700
every time I thought I was winning,
what if I didn't get stopped?
Obviously,

210
00:12:36.701 --> 00:12:37.810
but if it goes past the first round,

211
00:12:37.811 --> 00:12:40.510
I always thought I was winning every single fight or Lassi,
I thought,

212
00:12:40.511 --> 00:12:43.130
no question.
I want to fight without a doubt.
I was like,
oh.

213
00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:45.610
Even Rogan came in was like,
I think you got it.
I think you got it.

214
00:12:45.611 --> 00:12:47.170
And then when I went the other way,
everyone was like,
what?

215
00:12:47.171 --> 00:12:50.740
And that's where the crowd was booing.
Yup.
Yeah.

216
00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:53.680
Fight Game Vancouver.
That's my fault for leaving to the judges.

217
00:12:53.681 --> 00:12:58.090
Not the best performance that's on me.
Well,
you're forgiven.

218
00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:02.890
Thank you,
sir.
Thank you,
sir.
England.

219
00:13:03.010 --> 00:13:04.390
Brad Pickett,
the caddies.

220
00:13:04.391 --> 00:13:09.391
Fighting's undefeated 19 and now I bet you that your coaches are more nervous at

221
00:13:09.761 --> 00:13:13.800
this point.
A big job.
It's a tight shirt.
Big Gun.

222
00:13:14.630 --> 00:13:18.550
Got a set of tits,
tits on him.
I love him.
He's the best.

223
00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:23.470
He's my favorite record.
He's also a cop.

224
00:13:23.590 --> 00:13:28.030
I love it.
Yeah.
He's a Badass.
He's the best.
We got by far the best we got.

225
00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:32.470
Awesome.
He's so intense in the back when he comes back his oh man.
Super intense.

226
00:13:32.530 --> 00:13:35.710
Really?
I think,
I think pickets.
The biggest underdog on the main card.

227
00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:41.190
I think he's plus five 50 the caddies fighting this Brazilian now meet us 19 and

228
00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:44.120
oh man.
Doing something right.
If you're 19 and now,

229
00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:49.690
unless you fight and keeps his hands,
how to puffs.
There he is.
Look at them.

230
00:13:50.290 --> 00:13:52.350
Yeah.
Mine is six 60 I mean,
what?

231
00:13:52.450 --> 00:13:56.820
What's the point of embedding w w explain what minus six 60th.

232
00:13:57.620 --> 00:14:01.750
I'm an idiot.
When it comes to gap.
You'd have to put $660 not to win a hundred.

233
00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:05.950
Wow.
That's a,
that's a bad day.
That's ridiculous.

234
00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:09.730
I can't believe Robbie Lawler is the underdog.
You know what?
I get it.

235
00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:12.010
You know why?
Because Roy can wrestle.

236
00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:18.730
He did meet him before.
I know.
I know,
I agree.
I tell you what,

237
00:14:18.731 --> 00:14:23.260
I would not want to be an odds maker in Vegas that that does fighting odds.
Why?

238
00:14:23.261 --> 00:14:27.850
Because like Connor,
Chad,
it's a 12 what?
12 Day notice,
right?

239
00:14:27.851 --> 00:14:30.010
Right around 12 day notice.
You got to make those odds.

240
00:14:30.130 --> 00:14:33.820
We don't know what Chad was doing.
Did He,
was he eating camp training?

241
00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:37.120
Cause I know Chad,
the thing about chat is he'll take some time off.

242
00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:40.690
He's known to take time off and then going to camp when he has a funny,

243
00:14:40.691 --> 00:14:41.860
now that I didn't know it takes time.

244
00:14:41.861 --> 00:14:44.050
He's known as a guy that hunts and take some time off.

245
00:14:44.051 --> 00:14:48.190
So was he in camp or did you get the call and he's playing grab ass with wart

246
00:14:48.191 --> 00:14:51.560
hogs and wherever and it was like,
shit,
I better get in there 12 days.

247
00:14:51.561 --> 00:14:52.070
I'll fight Sean

248
00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:52.530
<v 0>and 12 days.</v>

249
00:14:52.530 --> 00:14:56.090
Not The people who set the odds are privy to that type of information.
No,

250
00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:58.910
that's the thing.
That's why betting on findings tough.

251
00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:03.170
I'm very nervous about the Conor McGregor fight and Ooh,
but what made me,

252
00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:05.990
what makes me nervous about the Conor fight?
My my heart.

253
00:15:06.170 --> 00:15:09.410
I want Connor to when he's the best thing that happened in the UFC and the long,

254
00:15:09.411 --> 00:15:12.800
long time since Brock Lesnar by far great lefthand bang.
And by the way,

255
00:15:13.190 --> 00:15:17.960
super banging.
But uh,
did you see Conor during the Wayne's he was drawn the fuck.

256
00:15:17.961 --> 00:15:20.030
Hey.
Wow,
look very,

257
00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:23.960
he looked like Dallas buyers club sunglasses throughout the whole thing.

258
00:15:23.961 --> 00:15:28.100
And I was wondering why and a nice saw.
Hello?
Picking big left hand.

259
00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:33.260
Oh,
don't,
no,
we take him down.
Gets a chance to recover.
It's a bad idea.

260
00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:36.690
Well,
he's an MMA fighter,
Brian.
Don't ever stop.
Come on.
Come on.

261
00:15:38.550 --> 00:15:42.310
Don't take them down.
There you go.
There you go.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Oh.

262
00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:47.000
Oh No,
no,
no,
no.
He's out.
He's out.
No,

263
00:15:47.001 --> 00:15:48.950
let him stand up,
man.
He's rock.

264
00:15:50.270 --> 00:15:50.930
<v 2>Okay.</v>

265
00:15:50.930 --> 00:15:54.060
<v 0>See You guy can recover when you do this.
Oh yeah.</v>

266
00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:59.100
Well he really took him out there.
Wow.
He's still not right.

267
00:15:59.470 --> 00:16:02.430
He's not right.
He's not right.
We don't want to rush in B.
Right.

268
00:16:03.090 --> 00:16:06.210
He's being patient is being patient.
It's called being a pro.

269
00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:09.090
It's called being a pro brand.
Lead.
Me.
I've rushed in there.

270
00:16:09.510 --> 00:16:12.460
Brian Callahan paid a price.
Eight a deep deep pricing.

271
00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:16.320
It's a guy named Ben Rothwell.
He's number six in the world now.
God dammit.

272
00:16:16.590 --> 00:16:19.620
So what's picket feeling right now?
What is he thinking?
He's staying calm.

273
00:16:19.621 --> 00:16:23.860
You know he,
he's deaf.
He knows he's winning the fight and the exchanges.

274
00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:26.760
So pickets getting momentum here.
And it's weird.

275
00:16:26.761 --> 00:16:30.930
It's like your gas tank comes back.
Even if you're tired and you rock the guy,

276
00:16:30.931 --> 00:16:33.510
you're like,
damn.
You don't even think about getting tired.

277
00:16:33.690 --> 00:16:36.090
Is he happy that he's bleeding?
Does he think to himself?
Yeah,

278
00:16:36.091 --> 00:16:40.130
he's loving the way.
Pick it like his angles and stuff.
Look at it.

279
00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:43.760
Oh Wow.

280
00:16:44.910 --> 00:16:49.710
This is a fight.
There's a good fight.
Wow.
Wow.
Damn ma'am.
Oo,

281
00:16:49.711 --> 00:16:54.050
he's rocked.
Wow.
What a great fire.

282
00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:59.040
Jesus.
Oh,
taking a stance right there.

283
00:16:59.041 --> 00:17:02.180
Look at us.
Tell you what for when the biggest Oh,

284
00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.270
for one of the biggest UFC fights of all time cards of all times.

285
00:17:06.271 --> 00:17:10.150
Exactly how you want to start this thing off.
Oh,
snaps.

286
00:17:10.350 --> 00:17:13.290
There's a reason these boys kicked this fight off or cart off.

287
00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:17.770
<v 2>Keep your hands up.
Wow.</v>

288
00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:21.780
<v 0>Tell you what,
my man,
my man,
I'll meet it.
Came back here.</v>

289
00:17:21.930 --> 00:17:25.290
He's a tough round of score.
Super tough friends.

290
00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:29.610
I would still give it to pick it.
Got Call him twice.
Come twice.

291
00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:32.570
Well it was still a minute left.
That's a lot of time to change.

292
00:17:36.310 --> 00:17:40.420
You see what I'm saying about the octagon though?
Yes.
So the Octonauts Nascar,

293
00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:44.590
but the fighters are clean now,
so he just flipped the script.
So now the UFC,

294
00:17:44.650 --> 00:17:48.640
you know,
by the way,
they're wearing the same shorts kind of,
right?

295
00:17:48.641 --> 00:17:50.070
I mean it's to say,
well one guy

296
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:53.450
<v 1>in the white,
I don't to why I don't think you should do white and black.</v>

297
00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:55.760
I think one guy should be in all red.
And when guys,

298
00:17:55.761 --> 00:17:59.940
she'd be an all blue blue or all black,
right?
Cause the gloves,

299
00:17:59.941 --> 00:18:02.700
the gloves that's going out because the corners are red and blue.
Right.

300
00:18:02.701 --> 00:18:03.630
So we have the shorts.

301
00:18:03.631 --> 00:18:07.470
Red and blue did distinct between the two cause they look very fucking similar.

302
00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:12.310
It's very confused.
I really do.
Oh Oh stats.
Pickets got,

303
00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:15.510
he's punching on angles here,
right,
Brendan and what's he doing here?
So,
yeah,

304
00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:19.500
I love a boxer,
man.
I said little detailed.

305
00:18:19.501 --> 00:18:21.790
He's slipping like he's standing there and able to see that

306
00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:27.870
my boy on meters frickin winning the tans throwing.
Oh Wow.

307
00:18:29.230 --> 00:18:33.540
Oh,
oh,
great fight.
Ooh.
What a round.

308
00:18:33.630 --> 00:18:38.430
A ground.
Rouse.
Look at them.
Chase God.
Rebound.

309
00:18:40.410 --> 00:18:42.940
Good for Reebok for them.

310
00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:46.770
I know a long way from Reebok pumps.

311
00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:52.050
Um,
way.
When did they even start making?

312
00:18:53.140 --> 00:18:56.580
Right now,
this is the first one.
Yeah,
this is the first fight.

313
00:18:57.030 --> 00:19:01.980
I'll tell you what though.
I like,
I like the clean look.
I like the,
um,
you know,

314
00:19:01.981 --> 00:19:05.760
I've been really outspoken.
I don't like Reebok,
but I like the clean look.

315
00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:10.290
That makes sense.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It looks better now about the octagon is messy.

316
00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:14.140
Uniformity.
I liked the uniform,
but I wished it,

317
00:19:14.330 --> 00:19:17.040
what I think we should have done is said,
all right.

318
00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:19.770
Reeboks gonna supply you guys with all this gear.
You can,

319
00:19:19.771 --> 00:19:23.730
if any other sponsors just know apparel sponsors.
Again,
if anything else,

320
00:19:23.731 --> 00:19:26.730
we know apparel,
so now the fighters look basic,

321
00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:31.880
but the octagon looks like a fucking taxi cab with those looks like a Jackson

322
00:19:32.550 --> 00:19:35.910
Pollock painting as they say,
Hey,
is there any way we can we be more ring girls?

323
00:19:35.910 --> 00:19:38.010
I cause I don't think four's enough.
Can we get eight?

324
00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:41.250
Is there any way we can get a tiredness?

325
00:19:41.550 --> 00:19:44.550
These guys or these guys are doing it here too,
and it,

326
00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:49.110
where were you going to say you're going to say,
these guys are sweating a tough

327
00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:52.530
boy.
These guys are fighting.

328
00:19:52.710 --> 00:19:55.410
They're fighting Brian and throw that in every now and then.
Boy,

329
00:19:55.411 --> 00:19:59.670
these guys are breathing the way he's moving Brennan.
You know what I'm doing?

330
00:19:59.671 --> 00:20:03.120
Ask me what I'm doing on my watch.
This fight.
You're acting like you're moving,

331
00:20:03.121 --> 00:20:04.500
studying.
You're studying them.

332
00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:09.930
Oh,
oh,

333
00:20:10.730 --> 00:20:15.200
oh wow.
20 you know 20 no.

334
00:20:15.201 --> 00:20:18.720
Can we write this guy in the top 15 wow.

335
00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:24.240
Good.
That's a perfect example of what you just said.
First round,

336
00:20:24.241 --> 00:20:27.660
sort of a little bit tentative and then he just picked it up.
Oh yeah.

337
00:20:28.770 --> 00:20:30.510
That's what's heartbreaking about this sport,
man.

338
00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:34.160
That's such a good job in gets caught with a knee.
It's just at this level.

339
00:20:34.210 --> 00:20:37.380
Even at,
even at this weight,
there's just no room for error.

340
00:20:37.381 --> 00:20:40.920
Matt take one time often it's just,
I'm not saying pig.
It took time off,

341
00:20:40.921 --> 00:20:42.740
but there's just,
there's no gap for it.

342
00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:47.630
It really sports that you can kind of get away with it.
Boom.
God,

343
00:20:48.370 --> 00:20:51.440
<v 0>Great.
Stop by.
I'm going to stop by McCarthy.</v>

344
00:20:51.441 --> 00:20:56.441
I agree 100% you have here you have evil Levine ass whoop sun down at the bottom

345
00:20:56.921 --> 00:21:00.730
there.
That's evil Levine.
You're,
you're in trouble because he's like,

346
00:21:02.890 --> 00:21:06.310
yeah,
that's not good for his head.
Oh Shit.
I don't like that.
Louis,

347
00:21:07.850 --> 00:21:08.880
what do you mean chat?

348
00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:13.270
If if evil of comes in the bags like I'm going to be your referee referee

349
00:21:13.271 --> 00:21:14.950
tonight.
I go off shit.

350
00:21:14.980 --> 00:21:19.090
Who's the most prudent McCarthy's the best in the business and McCarthy usually

351
00:21:19.091 --> 00:21:21.700
does a,
I bet he's the main event guy.
Mccarthy.

352
00:21:21.701 --> 00:21:25.000
He usually does the big fights because he's so damn good.

353
00:21:25.150 --> 00:21:29.170
There's not too much controversy with McCarthy,
but Pika got back up though.

354
00:21:29.171 --> 00:21:32.710
I mean,
he didn't die.
Why did they stop it?

355
00:21:33.090 --> 00:21:37.820
He was out a couple more minutes.
Let it die too.

356
00:21:38.650 --> 00:21:42.610
I think he got,
oh,
they sound like he was like,
no,

357
00:21:43.150 --> 00:21:47.820
he was fucked up.
He was super fun because
I don't even know what that word.

358
00:21:48.050 --> 00:21:50.440
Let me tell you this right now.
The guy got up and he deserves it.

359
00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:54.100
Two more minutes that that's some boxing shit.

360
00:21:54.101 --> 00:21:57.580
So box and you get dropped like that.
Or Ref comes up and goes one,

361
00:21:57.910 --> 00:22:02.130
two so you can kind of gather your shit.
That's why you get horrible brain dead.

362
00:22:02.470 --> 00:22:03.610
That's why the UFC safe.

363
00:22:03.611 --> 00:22:06.780
Just saying the ratings would go up a little bit more if he goes to a male.

364
00:22:06.940 --> 00:22:07.773
If you took out a knife,

365
00:22:09.590 --> 00:22:13.360
there should be nice personally not so what you're saying is that he got up

366
00:22:13.361 --> 00:22:16.130
because of gut instinct,
like just his body,
his car.

367
00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:18.540
He got knocked down in his feet.
He landed on the ground.

368
00:22:18.570 --> 00:22:19.890
He was out and then he came,

369
00:22:20.730 --> 00:22:24.990
came to look why interest to let a phenomenal fight though.
Phenomenal,

370
00:22:25.940 --> 00:22:28.870
phenomenal,
great left ticket,
had did a great job.

371
00:22:28.871 --> 00:22:30.670
He just got caught and against a great.

372
00:22:30.790 --> 00:22:34.420
Now is there any way we could spray paint some more sponsors?
I mean,

373
00:22:34.421 --> 00:22:37.540
I see a couple areas.
Oh,
valuable real estate,
right?

374
00:22:37.541 --> 00:22:39.950
So how much that costs monster.
Oh,

375
00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:43.780
they'd probably cost them millions just to rent that space.
Not Cheap.

376
00:22:43.850 --> 00:22:46.030
They can do it on my chest if they want for that kind of money.

377
00:22:46.690 --> 00:22:51.110
Is this a bad deal for fighters then that they're made to where I'll Reebok for

378
00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:56.340
Brendan?
Yes.
Yeah,
yeah.
Yeah.

379
00:22:57.070 --> 00:22:59.760
I figured because,
because typically when a transition,

380
00:22:59.761 --> 00:23:04.761
you become a fighter who is got a following like Brennan or if you're a fighter

381
00:23:05.081 --> 00:23:08.110
that has,
um,
really anyone you can,

382
00:23:08.111 --> 00:23:11.080
where you can make cut deals with various companies and say,

383
00:23:11.081 --> 00:23:16.081
give me 40 grand and I'll wear this tee shirt or whatever and oh,

384
00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:20.920
but Brian can,
they were like their own spunk ship during like interviews or low,

385
00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:27.340
not the week of not the weekend.
Well,
that's not fair.
How is that fair?

386
00:23:27.790 --> 00:23:31.710
That's life.
My man.
It's out of our,
if you want to be a fighter,

387
00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:34.060
you typically I play by they on a money.

388
00:23:34.690 --> 00:23:36.790
You probably don't want to be an MMA fighter.

389
00:23:37.060 --> 00:23:40.330
Well here the exception like you can be a 1% or

390
00:23:41.930 --> 00:23:46.310
like the u s a female World Cup soccer team.
Yeah,
they make what?

391
00:23:46.311 --> 00:23:50.000
50 $60,000 a year then?
Not that a lot of money but the reason why,

392
00:23:50.001 --> 00:23:52.320
what's that chick's name?
The hot one.
What's her name?
Alex Morgan.

393
00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:55.880
Three 400 500,000 because of awesome.

394
00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:59.120
Lots of judgments but she's not wearing those endorsements on the,

395
00:23:59.290 --> 00:24:02.210
on the soccer field.
She's getting it from Gatorade,
right?

396
00:24:02.211 --> 00:24:05.990
Nike all that out of the commercial.
Yeah.
Yeah.
A woman is a good guy,
man.

397
00:24:07.150 --> 00:24:11.440
Yeah.
Is He your Buddy Brian?
I hung out with him and he was like cool.
So no,

398
00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:13.010
he didn't match.
He did a couple of times.

399
00:24:13.011 --> 00:24:16.870
Well did a really nice guy cause he's still at cause that 70 show he's killing

400
00:24:16.871 --> 00:24:20.870
it on that 70 shell right.
Act as much.
He's more into politics.

401
00:24:20.871 --> 00:24:25.250
He's thinking about going into politics and he's like well because it shows got

402
00:24:25.251 --> 00:24:28.250
syndicated so he's just getting boat loads of money because your,

403
00:24:28.251 --> 00:24:30.980
she'll get syndicated.
You're balling 70 show.
Think how big that was.

404
00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:34.400
Semi me shows how much you think guys like that make now though.

405
00:24:34.401 --> 00:24:37.930
I don't know how.
What are the best 70 shot?
He probably makes it residual wise.

406
00:24:37.931 --> 00:24:38.764
Yeah.

407
00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:42.500
He could probably make a couple hundred thousand maybe a hundred dollars a year.

408
00:24:42.501 --> 00:24:47.180
Yeah,
that's it.
Wow.
More than that.
You'd be surprised.
You'd be surprised.
Yeah.

409
00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:50.530
Ashton Kutcher's ball in though and he leaves toy show.
Yeah,

410
00:24:50.540 --> 00:24:52.100
he's on two and half men though.
Right?
He's making,

411
00:24:52.970 --> 00:24:57.680
he also has a lot of other businesses.
Yeah.
Airbnb,

412
00:24:57.710 --> 00:24:59.840
Twitter and AIRBNB.
When it first started,

413
00:24:59.930 --> 00:25:04.400
only a few people full Chadman Eric Stonestreet and he's making a shitload of

414
00:25:04.401 --> 00:25:08.720
money,
you know stone street.
Which one?
See,
he's on modern family.
He plays Cam.

415
00:25:08.721 --> 00:25:13.430
The fact that fat gay guy,
is he gay in real life?
No,
but the redhead is

416
00:25:17.090 --> 00:25:21.680
Paige.
Vanna ants in the back.
Not Mad at her at all.
Super Pretty.

417
00:25:22.430 --> 00:25:24.410
It's hard for me to watch her get punched in the face.

418
00:25:25.010 --> 00:25:29.840
There's the man of the hour.
Love the suit.
Love it.
Look at him,

419
00:25:30.530 --> 00:25:31.363
look at him.

420
00:25:32.450 --> 00:25:36.410
Look at her five year olds by fights in the UFC and he's the biggest star.

421
00:25:36.620 --> 00:25:41.200
How cool is that?
He's awesome because he backs it up well tonight.

422
00:25:41.650 --> 00:25:44.270
His head right now,
Brennan,
you can't get in there,

423
00:25:44.271 --> 00:25:48.380
but what do you think if you had to guess as a fighter,
a for him?

424
00:25:49.220 --> 00:25:53.840
Man,
he's a different animal man.
I think he's just excited to get in there,

425
00:25:53.841 --> 00:25:57.830
you know.
Oh,
can we turn the sound off on it?
On it up on this?
I think we're good,

426
00:25:57.831 --> 00:26:02.410
Brian.
For a commercial.
We're good.
Don't ever listen to Brian on sound.

427
00:26:04.810 --> 00:26:08.900
Ah,
boom.

428
00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:16.480
I think Rhonda is the most dominant female mixed martial arts athlete,

429
00:26:17.211 --> 00:26:21.620
but I think,
uh,
Serena Williams is the most dominant she mailed last week.

430
00:26:21.710 --> 00:26:25.970
She just won Wimbledon.
Yes.
She wants,
she wants today.

431
00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:30.890
And think about the competition she's facing worldwide.
Worldwide.
Worldwide.

432
00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:32.270
Oh,
everywhere.
I'm from Russia,

433
00:26:32.980 --> 00:26:36.150
I think our record this year or something like 45 and one and she,

434
00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:38.920
and the thing is she's competing all the time.
Nonstop.

435
00:26:38.930 --> 00:26:43.890
Rhonda can beats twice a year,
right?
Like Batch Korea.
Okay.

436
00:26:44.130 --> 00:26:48.570
Yeah.
That's a tough sell,
man.
That's a fucking Tufts.
So like,

437
00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:53.130
like Serena is going to war.
She's going on with the four and five hours.

438
00:26:53.131 --> 00:26:57.690
How long has tennis been around?
Women's tennis is a big deal.
Yes.
So the,
the,

439
00:26:57.900 --> 00:27:02.070
the competition is way higher than women's MMA.
I'm not hating on Rhonda.

440
00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:03.410
We all know,
I love considered,

441
00:27:03.411 --> 00:27:07.740
I considered and she's considered the best female tennis player ever and ever.

442
00:27:08.450 --> 00:27:09.420
But so when,

443
00:27:09.450 --> 00:27:12.930
when sports illustrated said Ronda Rousey best dot most dominant female athlete

444
00:27:12.931 --> 00:27:17.140
of all time.
I disagree at Serena Williams by something.
Yes,
go ahead.

445
00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:22.050
Go ahead,
sir.
I did a sketch with Serena Williams and she's very nice,

446
00:27:22.051 --> 00:27:25.510
but she smelled funny.
That's all I have to say.
Well that's right.
That's right.

447
00:27:26.010 --> 00:27:29.300
I didn't say that she would know that.
Nothing to do with that.
She's not funny.

448
00:27:29.370 --> 00:27:34.140
Why was it possible that she ate some?
No,
we did a sketch where we play tennis.

449
00:27:34.141 --> 00:27:36.780
Right.
And then I took a photo with her and she smelled funny.

450
00:27:36.781 --> 00:27:39.710
That's all I'm saying.
What do you mean like shit,
not like hockey.
Blood.

451
00:27:40.410 --> 00:27:44.280
Like hot blood.
Yeah,
like that might be tested.
It was curdled like hurdle blood.

452
00:27:44.410 --> 00:27:48.260
I've never smelt curdle blood either of.
Oh,
what would you compare it to?
Like,

453
00:27:49.660 --> 00:27:54.210
yeah,
well it's like maybe spam.
Everybody's cost money sometimes,
but listen.

454
00:27:54.420 --> 00:27:57.550
All right,
well it wasn't of thing.
I have not,
I have nothing against.

455
00:27:59.420 --> 00:28:02.350
It's just twisting words around.

456
00:28:03.540 --> 00:28:08.490
She smells like dog.
She's a nice person.
That's all she smelled funny.
Move on.

457
00:28:08.540 --> 00:28:12.060
Hey,
I'll tell you what.
She's too much for you.
Count.
Oh,
100% too much.

458
00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:15.780
Are you kidding Bobby Lee?
Too much for you.
Have a conversation with [inaudible].

459
00:28:16.010 --> 00:28:18.840
I was looking at harassing her legs and her arms.
I was like,
well,
you're,
you're,

460
00:28:18.930 --> 00:28:23.460
I'm way too light in the ass.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no.
I went to,
uh,
it was in Miami.
He was,

461
00:28:23.461 --> 00:28:26.730
I liked like the Miami open or something like that and I knew her agent and they

462
00:28:26.731 --> 00:28:30.450
brought me in the back while she's warming up and I was like,
Jesus Christ,

463
00:28:30.690 --> 00:28:33.810
she's too much for me.
Yeah.
She's too much of an animal and you're a big,

464
00:28:33.990 --> 00:28:35.490
you need to make love to,
is that what you're saying?

465
00:28:36.230 --> 00:28:39.690
Take it on the sheets and then toss me around like a baton,
like a circus.
Bhutan.

466
00:28:39.691 --> 00:28:42.390
She would eat you like a sardine.
You're not.
You're an appetizer.

467
00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:46.410
You're wasting your fucking time alone is the size of your waist.

468
00:28:46.411 --> 00:28:49.110
I saw her at the Australian Open in Melbourne.
Yeah,

469
00:28:49.380 --> 00:28:54.110
she is so just beautifully muscular.
She's prettier though.

470
00:28:54.690 --> 00:28:59.110
She's super pretty,
very pretty face.
She's just,
I smelled her and she has some,

471
00:28:59.111 --> 00:29:02.490
she smelled like apricots,
old biddies.

472
00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:06.500
I wouldn't be able to in a blog ass blow out as an athletic,

473
00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:10.320
more athletic than anyone.
You could rest all your books,

474
00:29:10.350 --> 00:29:12.990
all your books on that ass.
That is a,
she can handle this.
It's,

475
00:29:12.991 --> 00:29:15.420
she's too much for me,
which I've never said that before in my life,

476
00:29:15.421 --> 00:29:19.210
but she's too much.
She's way too much.
She,
she for her,

477
00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:23.730
she did it in Lavonne Arrington for a couple of minutes of Arlington and then

478
00:29:23.731 --> 00:29:27.990
he's the boy Williams,
right?
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

479
00:29:27.991 --> 00:29:31.980
She did date come and good call.
He's small.

480
00:29:31.981 --> 00:29:35.990
He's probably whispering and there's some fucking poems and shit or he's
driving.

481
00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:39.540
He's riding high and he's riding high and deep and true.

482
00:29:39.630 --> 00:29:43.880
Coming us that Tana Guana Dick,
100% looks like go boy.

483
00:29:43.881 --> 00:29:47.950
Brands that so at wish nightclub in Denver,
Colorado.

484
00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:52.060
The security team was myself,
Brandon thatch and Cody Donovan.

485
00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:54.100
That was a security team.
That's it.
That's a problem.

486
00:29:54.101 --> 00:29:56.430
I don't want any trouble with any of that.
I don't want to cause any prop.
Right.

487
00:29:56.431 --> 00:30:01.170
And His dad is known fricking around Denver.
He's such a baddest,

488
00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:03.670
there's pressure on Brandon grown up cause his dad clearance,

489
00:30:03.671 --> 00:30:08.020
that was such a bad ass in Denver.
Kickboxer ran a gym.

490
00:30:08.021 --> 00:30:11.740
He trained his son since he was little.
So Brandon's always been kind of this,

491
00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:15.610
he's been the guy in the gym who was never super dedicated,

492
00:30:15.611 --> 00:30:17.230
but he was the most talented by far.

493
00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:19.300
And I'd always say if that kid ever got his shit together,

494
00:30:19.301 --> 00:30:21.690
he's going to be champion one day he's going to be a monster.

495
00:30:22.030 --> 00:30:24.070
Does he have his shit together?
He has his shit together.

496
00:30:24.100 --> 00:30:27.250
He got his shit together.
He's in the UFC right now.
Does he suck that much way?

497
00:30:27.251 --> 00:30:31.270
Was he walking around huge.
He's huge.
Man.
I mean he's,
he's God.

498
00:30:31.271 --> 00:30:33.760
I can't remember last time.
So you know he's the biggest welterweight.

499
00:30:33.761 --> 00:30:36.430
I know he's bigger than St pier by far.
Jesus by far,

500
00:30:36.460 --> 00:30:39.940
st period used to fly thatch up when he was getting ready for condit,

501
00:30:40.420 --> 00:30:44.380
St pier would fly thatch up.
That just standup is second to none really.

502
00:30:44.381 --> 00:30:46.820
If he can get comfortable with second to none.
You,

503
00:30:47.070 --> 00:30:49.660
you weren't talking about a ladies man.
If you're talking about,

504
00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:53.050
if you're talking about the Frickin CEO of black belts and chicken heads,

505
00:30:53.051 --> 00:30:56.480
is that right?
She's the CEO.
I'm an intern.
Can painting.
I'm an intern.

506
00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:59.200
You see his body boy,
his boss guys,
Cutie.

507
00:30:59.230 --> 00:31:03.520
He's a cutie pie was more girls than I do.
Really?
100% this guy,

508
00:31:03.521 --> 00:31:06.430
he's got narrow shoulders.
You know why he's a raver.

509
00:31:06.790 --> 00:31:10.240
He was a braver forever before,
before fights in Denver.

510
00:31:10.241 --> 00:31:12.740
This fool would turn on like numb checks with flames.

511
00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:18.010
I swear to God and he goes out.
Wow.

512
00:31:18.130 --> 00:31:21.760
Dime piece the way he's talked to grow a powerful least her bowling.

513
00:31:21.790 --> 00:31:22.840
That's Elliot Marshall,

514
00:31:22.841 --> 00:31:25.600
my good buddy and that's Christian now and my first coach.

515
00:31:25.630 --> 00:31:28.480
Where's Lester balling?
Elisa Bowlin's right there.
Okay.
These,

516
00:31:28.481 --> 00:31:32.050
the sh the guy who looks like a fire hydrant with there's wrestler,

517
00:31:32.630 --> 00:31:37.390
phenomenal wrestler.
He was the head coach for GSP,
for wrestling myself.

518
00:31:37.391 --> 00:31:38.950
Shank Carlin named Mark Cart.

519
00:31:39.130 --> 00:31:41.470
You're talking about the cream of the crop at least,
or bowling man.

520
00:31:41.471 --> 00:31:44.800
They don't get better than him.
The old man behind them is Edward James Olmos.

521
00:31:44.830 --> 00:31:48.940
That's exactly right.
I shaved his head.
And then Elliot Marshall,

522
00:31:48.941 --> 00:31:52.330
he runs a Easton's in Denver.
He's a black belt.

523
00:31:52.331 --> 00:31:54.610
Compete in Jiu Jitsu forever compete in the UFC.

524
00:31:54.611 --> 00:31:58.090
And then to the left description,
Allen,
who is fat just striking coach.

525
00:31:58.560 --> 00:31:59.950
I'm telling if that can get loose,

526
00:31:59.951 --> 00:32:02.590
you're gonna see a crazy ass knocked out tonight if he gets comfortable.

527
00:32:02.710 --> 00:32:07.210
I've seen this boy do some shit and he's like,

528
00:32:07.450 --> 00:32:11.140
listen to this.
He's like a giant Anthony Pettis.
He can go both ways.

529
00:32:12.020 --> 00:32:16.510
He knew Orthodox and Orthodox.
He's crazy.
Southport,
whatever.
Look how big he is.

530
00:32:16.700 --> 00:32:20.440
He's big.
But you know if there's an Achilles heel to brand fest,
you know it is.

531
00:32:20.770 --> 00:32:24.940
I can say what it is.
Go ahead.
My guess is that he,
he can be,

532
00:32:24.941 --> 00:32:29.260
he's easily broken.
No,
goddammit.

533
00:32:31.450 --> 00:32:35.950
No card.
No Paul Jujitsu,

534
00:32:37.330 --> 00:32:39.890
Jujitsu.
He's been working on,
it meant Jujitsu.

535
00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:43.580
He's never been a guy that I had to attack his character.

536
00:32:44.620 --> 00:32:47.420
He's a good guy.
I don't know all my breaks.
Easy.
Yeah,
man.

537
00:32:47.421 --> 00:32:49.970
He's on one of the biggest UFC fight cards of the year because the brakes,

538
00:32:49.971 --> 00:32:54.600
he's like,
that's so funny.
He's a B.

539
00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:57.650
Brandon's friends with somebody.
He's going to defend him to the fucking death.

540
00:32:58.070 --> 00:33:02.560
This is true.
You were friends now I got,
you know,

541
00:33:03.470 --> 00:33:07.550
walked.
I'll come to laugh,
act and slept some.
Got Brendan.
I'll beat up.

542
00:33:07.551 --> 00:33:10.730
Everybody know this guy right here though.
What's phenomenal,
Jujitsu.

543
00:33:11.090 --> 00:33:15.590
But he has gotten really pretty eyes.
His eyes are nice.
Oh,

544
00:33:17.690 --> 00:33:19.820
very close friend.
That's why everyone's cheering for him.

545
00:33:20.540 --> 00:33:23.420
The only time we should turn this up is when Connor walks out.

546
00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:27.090
That's the only time.
Well,
you want Trump to know,
oh,

547
00:33:27.170 --> 00:33:31.520
turn this Carl's junior commercial up.
I like,
I like commercials.
Uh,

548
00:33:31.521 --> 00:33:33.500
if this fight goes to the ground,
I'm a little worried about it.

549
00:33:33.620 --> 00:33:35.060
Good luck in Sachse down though.

550
00:33:35.310 --> 00:33:40.160
It's good luck getting them down for how phenomenal.
Take down defense.
Crazy.

551
00:33:40.161 --> 00:33:44.000
Nice.
Yikes.
He's got to know that too.
I don't,

552
00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:47.870
I don't know how one goes in there and you're fighting a monster and he's going

553
00:33:47.871 --> 00:33:50.780
to try to knee and kick and punch your head off and they're really no gloves.

554
00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:53.660
Well,
the thing is,
when your Jujitsu is as good as Gunnar Nelson,

555
00:33:53.661 --> 00:33:57.890
you've beat guys like Jeff Monson.
You're not too concerned about,
you know,

556
00:33:57.950 --> 00:34:00.680
like he's been,
he's been there were tough guys.

557
00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:05.360
It doesn't matter if it's taken every opponent down.
Um,
yeah.

558
00:34:05.361 --> 00:34:07.820
He's never find a guy like Thatcher in the UFC.
Not even close.

559
00:34:08.090 --> 00:34:10.340
I think it was last night.
It was Rick story,
right?
He lasts my decision.

560
00:34:10.820 --> 00:34:13.500
I think it was a close decision.
You lost a rich body.
That's,

561
00:34:13.590 --> 00:34:15.610
that's a body that has never done steroids.
Right there.

562
00:34:15.770 --> 00:34:19.720
Story actually was able to take them down.
You're not gonna see how,

563
00:34:19.750 --> 00:34:21.680
you know what factors wrestling's not bad at all.

564
00:34:21.681 --> 00:34:23.150
I wouldn't be surprised with that.
She takes none.

565
00:34:23.151 --> 00:34:27.730
Just makes it go for no so much.
I'm a pastor.
Maybe use know much.

566
00:34:28.250 --> 00:34:32.090
You go,
girl,
no more than Brian.
Hey,
fuck you man.

567
00:34:32.210 --> 00:34:35.900
[inaudible]
hot girl.

568
00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:38.920
Brian fighter in the hot girl.

569
00:34:39.380 --> 00:34:42.280
Your girlfriend's very hot by the gay.

570
00:34:43.610 --> 00:34:47.380
Now some of them,
a lot of sex going on.
Hey

571
00:34:50.510 --> 00:34:54.230
Dude,
by the way,
brand that's six to,
that's no joke.
He's huge.
But look,

572
00:34:54.231 --> 00:34:56.600
the re only a two and a half inch reach advantage.

573
00:34:57.540 --> 00:35:00.200
What does he suck down from

574
00:35:02.380 --> 00:35:07.010
210 pounds?
Wow and shredded Jesus.

575
00:35:07.190 --> 00:35:12.140
Satch is a monster man.
My Colorado Boys.
Proud of those guys.
I love those guys.

576
00:35:13.130 --> 00:35:16.660
What's the Black Guy's name?
Herb Gray.
What's his name?
Dean.
That's it.

577
00:35:18.170 --> 00:35:21.350
I call him Harry Dean hot.
I'm not going to lie to you guys.

578
00:35:21.351 --> 00:35:26.000
I heard herb has a pterodactyl Dick.

579
00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:30.620
You know how straight up there's still room or around the,
around the fight club.

580
00:35:30.621 --> 00:35:34.190
My man.
Well of course he does.
Let's see,
I don't,

581
00:35:34.191 --> 00:35:38.110
I want to say Kevin,
what's that mean?
I mean he's

582
00:35:38.110 --> 00:35:39.660
<v 1>a what?
How tall is he?
Six.</v>

583
00:35:39.690 --> 00:35:44.490
He's 66 he's 97 47 67.66 something right.

584
00:35:44.550 --> 00:35:47.580
And he's a big African American.
It doesn't matter you.
They have a little one.

585
00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:50.790
Well know Shaquille O'neil.
They say he has a baby bird dick.

586
00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:56.040
That's what everyone says.
His ex girlfriend came out as a joke.

587
00:35:56.350 --> 00:35:59.950
There's actually a friend of mine dated a guy in the UFC who is,

588
00:35:59.951 --> 00:36:04.860
I'm black and he,
she says he's hung like a field mouse.
Oh,
which one is it?

589
00:36:06.030 --> 00:36:10.260
We'll talk about it off here.
I spotted Arnold Schwarzenegger in the crowd.

590
00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:14.880
He loves [inaudible].
Here we go.
Here we go.
Here we go.
Here we go.
Look at gunner.

591
00:36:15.330 --> 00:36:18.900
Gunner.
Well,
he's used to going with Connor,
so he's,
he's going to see some kicks.

592
00:36:19.420 --> 00:36:23.970
Connor's Chin and talked about a clash of styles.
Come on.

593
00:36:23.971 --> 00:36:28.650
Thatchy that's got a dome on him.
Big Head.
Big head

594
00:36:30.270 --> 00:36:33.910
hesitate.
Well the take down my man.
Yeah,
I've got gotta be careful.

595
00:36:34.220 --> 00:36:39.170
I'm just trying to get him to the cage.
Oh,
ouch.
That hurt a lot of ink.

596
00:36:39.270 --> 00:36:40.290
You know what it looks like.

597
00:36:40.291 --> 00:36:45.090
He's just rocking box underneath those probably not athletic undies.

598
00:36:45.430 --> 00:36:50.280
I said,
we're in a cup.
Yes,
you have to work up.
Oh.
Oh.

599
00:36:50.910 --> 00:36:53.430
I'm telling you man.
Wait for that.
You get comfortable.

600
00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:57.880
You can't basis is fight skills off that Ben Henderson fight couldn't be a worse

601
00:36:57.881 --> 00:37:01.860
match up for the guy.
Oh my God.
Well also Ben Hanson is a monster.

602
00:37:02.010 --> 00:37:05.430
Ben Henderson's a 1%.
I'll tell you what you don't want to do.
Get in the clinch.

603
00:37:05.431 --> 00:37:09.300
Brandon Thatch.
If I'm [inaudible] he's,
and you're up more ties his shit.
My man,

604
00:37:09.301 --> 00:37:13.350
Jesus thatching cowboys started more type fricking in diapers.

605
00:37:13.700 --> 00:37:18.030
Everybody say buddy.
Super Buddies.
Yeah.
I loved cowboy.
Hey,

606
00:37:18.031 --> 00:37:21.060
I want to get Kevin to come out to the show in Denver.
Yeah,
probably not man.

607
00:37:21.061 --> 00:37:24.070
You know he came last time.
Yeah.
Not this time.
You don't know anything.

608
00:37:24.990 --> 00:37:27.720
Just talk to them.
That's a big commitment on the old,
uh,
on your leg.

609
00:37:28.020 --> 00:37:31.890
On the old leg.
Yeah.
Powerful.
Josh Ford does a lot of zinc.

610
00:37:34.850 --> 00:37:39.310
Boy.
Boy,
they're both hesitant,
right?
This is what happens when you get cut.
Oh No.

611
00:37:39.311 --> 00:37:43.740
Oh No.
Oh Shit.
Oh Shit.
Worst case scenario,
full mount.

612
00:37:43.741 --> 00:37:48.510
Just blasting the face.
He relaxed any,
it took a little bit of time on that was,

613
00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:51.540
I'll tell you why.
I'll tell you what not good.

614
00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:55.740
And when you got Gunnar Nelson in half guard couldn't be worse for Brandon

615
00:37:55.740 --> 00:38:00.340
Thatch right now.
Ouch.
Oh boy.
So I control,
Ooh.

616
00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:03.540
And we're not talking about just a regular old black belt here.

617
00:38:03.541 --> 00:38:05.820
We're talking about a guy who's competed in one.

618
00:38:06.300 --> 00:38:09.120
I mean some serious competitions and Jujitsu.
Got Her.

619
00:38:09.121 --> 00:38:13.860
Nelson is a phenom on the ground.
Yeah,
he's,
he's in full amount on Brad Thatch.

620
00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:18.030
Well,
if someone said,
hey,
what's the worst case scenario for?
That's that's,

621
00:38:18.050 --> 00:38:22.860
I'm like,
well I'd say mid.
What his brand is has to do with his hands.

622
00:38:22.890 --> 00:38:25.680
Is that what he's doing?
Supposed to do a,
well you can't,

623
00:38:26.130 --> 00:38:28.830
what he can't do is grab around the body.

624
00:38:28.920 --> 00:38:33.390
But you got to realize that a lot of guys were naked.
Oh No.

625
00:38:36.200 --> 00:38:40.330
<v 0>See I don't like the body lock.
Nope.
The hear me out here.
Joe Disagrees.</v>

626
00:38:40.331 --> 00:38:42.310
If Rogan was here,
we'd be talking to him about this.

627
00:38:42.460 --> 00:38:47.140
But the body life doesn't allow you to,
to move.

628
00:38:47.141 --> 00:38:51.040
You know what I'm saying?
Like you're not going to advance and awesome.

629
00:38:51.130 --> 00:38:53.980
And also you got to remember thatches rocked.
So this is GIM.

630
00:38:54.070 --> 00:38:55.980
Thats a little bit of opportunity to,

631
00:38:56.780 --> 00:39:01.570
although he's not and he's not going to do it with one hand,
two hands.

632
00:39:01.610 --> 00:39:06.610
Oh God.
Oh Man.
Wow.
Fight by Gunnar Nelson.

633
00:39:07.150 --> 00:39:08.620
Wow.
Wow.
Hey,

634
00:39:08.621 --> 00:39:11.350
remember that time I hyped up a guy for an hour and then he got his ass whooped.

635
00:39:11.410 --> 00:39:14.500
Yeah,
that just happened.
Hey,
it happens.

636
00:39:15.450 --> 00:39:20.190
I don't trust you anymore.
You shouldn't.
I lost faith in,
you know,

637
00:39:20.290 --> 00:39:24.640
if a friends fighting never listened to me.
Oh,
she's a monster though.

638
00:39:24.910 --> 00:39:29.700
Nelson was the underdog,
right?
Yeah.
Barely.
Barely.
That's a a,
that's a,

639
00:39:29.830 --> 00:39:33.710
that's a,
that's two in a row for that.
Yeah.
It's a tough,
tough.
Matchups man.

640
00:39:33.730 --> 00:39:37.060
Too many raves.
Ah,
hopefully it's not raining some more.

641
00:39:37.490 --> 00:39:41.350
Please not raving anymore.
Let's see what happened here.
Boom.
Hands down.

642
00:39:41.351 --> 00:39:46.310
He was looking
straight,
right Sam?
It

643
00:39:48.690 --> 00:39:52.660
change.
Oh boy.
He didn't think he wasn't thinking.

644
00:39:52.690 --> 00:39:56.770
Momentary lapse of concentration and then a lot of guys,
why do you do this?

645
00:39:56.771 --> 00:39:58.600
Brendon,
you should never do this,
right.
Well,
no.

646
00:39:58.601 --> 00:40:02.490
A lot of guys who don't have a big Jujitsu base go to all fours because that's

647
00:40:02.491 --> 00:40:05.540
what you do in wrestling and stand up.
You got all fours,
you stand up,

648
00:40:05.580 --> 00:40:06.970
you have the high level grappler.

649
00:40:07.030 --> 00:40:10.270
He wants you to turn that way because now that he's on your back you got
trouble.

650
00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:13.240
Now he shouldn't have let them get this either but I should have been doing two

651
00:40:13.241 --> 00:40:16.240
on one on the glove that he let that get around his neck and it was just all

652
00:40:16.241 --> 00:40:21.070
over it again man.
That's if you're not training Jujitsu a ton.

653
00:40:21.071 --> 00:40:24.340
When you get in those situations you don't paint so it's not second nature.

654
00:40:24.520 --> 00:40:26.410
If you're down there,
go with high level guys a lot.

655
00:40:26.590 --> 00:40:29.620
It's going to be second nature.
He has my back.
I might be a little rock.

656
00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:33.550
I got to go two on one cause I'm gonna Control Control two on one or two hands

657
00:40:33.551 --> 00:40:34.960
on one.
Here's where I'm confused.

658
00:40:34.961 --> 00:40:37.550
If you know you're fighting a monster like Gunnar Nelson worrying out,

659
00:40:37.570 --> 00:40:39.100
rolling with high level gods and he probably is,

660
00:40:39.101 --> 00:40:42.220
especially if Elliot Marcia says,
coach,
you're rolling with black belts.

661
00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:47.080
But if it's a seven week camp and Gunnar Nelson's been translating how long this

662
00:40:47.081 --> 00:40:52.000
is language.
Yeah.
You know what I'm saying?
Shit.
That's a bummer man.

663
00:40:52.090 --> 00:40:53.230
It's just hard fight.

664
00:40:53.250 --> 00:40:57.400
But a huge wind by gunner praying and had some shit to look in the mirror.
Man,

665
00:40:57.790 --> 00:41:00.830
that's a tough law.
Now tonight is he,
does he cry?
I mean,

666
00:41:00.840 --> 00:41:04.270
do you cry when you lose like that?
Oh yeah.
Oh,
you don't want to talk to anyone?

667
00:41:04.340 --> 00:41:07.300
Do you got certain guys?
Take it different.
Like Alistair Overeem,

668
00:41:07.301 --> 00:41:10.440
he's lost and he'll tweet out like gap part of the game and then you seem,

669
00:41:10.441 --> 00:41:14.980
you seem gentle so you seem like you would cry.
Oh,
I'm in a ball crying ground.

670
00:41:14.981 --> 00:41:18.430
Thanks Bro.
Hold on.
Hold on baby.
Hold on,
hold on.
Hey Bobby,
what's your hands?

671
00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:20.110
Thanks man.
Yeah,

672
00:41:20.220 --> 00:41:23.920
I don't deal with lots of things that great left.

673
00:41:24.280 --> 00:41:28.540
Oh God.
On the chin.
The thing,
if you're in that range,

674
00:41:28.541 --> 00:41:32.440
why are your hands down and Chin up?
He talks about a high level striker here.

675
00:41:32.441 --> 00:41:34.160
I just don't think he respected his striking.

676
00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:36.680
It looks like he stepped back to reset.

677
00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:40.160
Like he stepped down and who didn't step back though.
He just like,
I don't know.

678
00:41:40.161 --> 00:41:42.350
It'd be,
maybe he thought dunner was going to step back.
Yeah,

679
00:41:42.351 --> 00:41:46.410
that's what it looks like.
He misread something.
Yeah.
That's tough.

680
00:41:46.660 --> 00:41:48.690
You get in those habits when you spar sometimes,
right?

681
00:41:48.700 --> 00:41:51.920
With a hundred percent a hundred percent you get in those bad habits,
man,

682
00:41:51.980 --> 00:41:54.950
cause you,
you reset.
Your buddy's not going to hit you.
Now you're in a fight.

683
00:41:55.010 --> 00:41:57.650
Tell you what's trouble though.
Guess who's boy that is Connor.

684
00:41:57.651 --> 00:41:59.570
You don't think that's a huge motivation.

685
00:41:59.630 --> 00:42:04.010
Boost your boy who you went through this entire camp with and then he just

686
00:42:04.011 --> 00:42:06.720
dominated the biggest fight of his career.
Amazing,

687
00:42:07.610 --> 00:42:12.610
powerful champion and Chris Weidman tell you what you wanna my favorite girl

688
00:42:12.660 --> 00:42:16.310
fighter.
Best striker in the world for women.
A killer.

689
00:42:17.410 --> 00:42:21.360
Did you say your killer?
No.
I said,
oh killer Jesus.
Maybe it is.

690
00:42:23.330 --> 00:42:25.030
All of these guys.
Damn rough have,

691
00:42:25.031 --> 00:42:28.910
I'll take this audience looks just as big as him and he fights at 55 and he's

692
00:42:28.911 --> 00:42:32.300
definitely not as big as he looks at it now.
Definitely not.
Nope.

693
00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:36.920
This guy seems humble.
Yeah,
super humble.
He like celebrate

694
00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:42.650
the Brian Kelly.
You've seen Gunnar Nelson Aka the kid of the UFC.

695
00:42:42.670 --> 00:42:45.020
Like grow my beard pretty big.
I might grow a big beard.

696
00:42:45.021 --> 00:42:46.520
Have you ever had a big beard?
No,
but I,

697
00:42:46.521 --> 00:42:49.610
but I'm looking at these guys and I'm feeling like I need to.
Bobby,

698
00:42:49.611 --> 00:42:52.220
have you ever had a big,
I can't look at me.

699
00:42:52.850 --> 00:42:54.380
This is 22 years of growth right here.

700
00:42:54.740 --> 00:42:59.740
It looks like ants attack and my mouth cause 15 here's her fellow and my pubes.

701
00:43:00.200 --> 00:43:02.420
They don't curl it straight.
They go straight out.

702
00:43:06.910 --> 00:43:10.280
It's not because I'm scared like it's constantly scared.

703
00:43:10.300 --> 00:43:11.690
So it sticks out like that.
Yeah,

704
00:43:11.870 --> 00:43:14.660
it's like a porcupine trying to protect that day.
You're welcome.

705
00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:20.980
UFC 200 how crazy is that?
When,

706
00:43:21.190 --> 00:43:23.660
when do we stop counting and what point do we stop counting?

707
00:43:23.780 --> 00:43:27.350
You don't see 441 well you have to know the numbers,

708
00:43:27.380 --> 00:43:31.070
so cause I loved to 96 you know what I mean?
Without numbers.

709
00:43:31.071 --> 00:43:35.420
How are you going to say it looks good.
I agree.
Yeah,
I agree.

710
00:43:35.421 --> 00:43:40.280
I guess there's so many shows.
What do you do,
man?
This is like fight night,
right?

711
00:43:40.281 --> 00:43:44.570
There's UFC on Fox.
You were just on Jerry six 71 that's right.

712
00:43:44.780 --> 00:43:49.030
That's right.
That's right.
Now see the difference.
This guy looks like he's gay.

713
00:43:49.340 --> 00:43:50.750
He's not as disciplined with his hands.

714
00:43:50.780 --> 00:43:55.670
Jeremy Stephens is a knockout artist and he did.
He,
I don't know.

715
00:43:55.700 --> 00:44:00.290
Did he not make weight?
That's an issue.
You're not.
You're right.

716
00:44:00.320 --> 00:44:03.070
He did it.
And what does that mean?
What happens when you get on doc?

717
00:44:03.330 --> 00:44:07.380
I think 30% 30% or 26 she knows more than you

718
00:44:08.990 --> 00:44:09.061
have.

719
00:44:09.061 --> 00:44:14.061
Your 5% 30% 30% of your fibers or 20% few windows.

720
00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:18.800
Uh,
yes,
it does count.
But the thing is,

721
00:44:19.010 --> 00:44:21.170
if there's one thing that pisses you off,

722
00:44:21.171 --> 00:44:25.070
see off more than having a shitty performance is not making weight.

723
00:44:25.190 --> 00:44:28.250
They'll cut your ass for not making way.
Anthony Johnson,
Andrew Johnson,

724
00:44:28.430 --> 00:44:31.070
he must wait a bunch of time.
They cut his ass.
Dude,

725
00:44:31.210 --> 00:44:32.670
tell me if you don't make weight,
man,

726
00:44:32.910 --> 00:44:36.960
there's nothing that pisses Dana white and Joe Silva Sophomore except have just

727
00:44:36.961 --> 00:44:41.170
been a real shitty performer.
But if you don't make weight,
man,
good luck.

728
00:44:41.340 --> 00:44:46.310
We'll Connor had to lose her.
I had to drop like 27 pounds,
26 pounds coming in.

729
00:44:48.390 --> 00:44:52.980
What happened to the Korean Zombie?
He went,
he joined the Korean military.

730
00:44:53.010 --> 00:44:55.910
He's out.
He fought Josie Aldo.
I was there.

731
00:44:57.480 --> 00:44:59.370
And you want to talking about killers role.
Hey Brian,

732
00:44:59.371 --> 00:45:01.160
you wants to touch into the fight companion.
Sorry,

733
00:45:01.170 --> 00:45:04.650
but I'm just checking to make sure that I'm not getting any,
uh Oh Bobby here.

734
00:45:05.610 --> 00:45:08.700
Ya Know Bobby's right here.
Yeah,
no,
we'll text you next time.

735
00:45:09.660 --> 00:45:13.130
Could there be a bigger killers role than featherweight right now?
Look at that.

736
00:45:13.620 --> 00:45:18.030
Look at that.
I'll tell you who's my dark horse?
Max Holloway.
First of all,

737
00:45:18.031 --> 00:45:21.630
he went to decision with Connor grant concert,
but he has more confidence now.

738
00:45:21.660 --> 00:45:22.980
Remember when you did the Cub Swanson?

739
00:45:23.370 --> 00:45:26.890
That's hallway is a fuck monster.

740
00:45:27.130 --> 00:45:31.290
45 is so stupid.
Either young kids,
young,
young Hawaiian.

741
00:45:31.500 --> 00:45:35.700
The pride of the Hawaiians cause he's at,
she's all Hawaiian,
isn't it?
Yeah.

742
00:45:35.701 --> 00:45:38.360
They don't come a howly because Travis Browne the call Holly,
right?

743
00:45:38.360 --> 00:45:41.490
Cause he's a white boy from Hawaii in Hawaii.
They call them hop.

744
00:45:41.491 --> 00:45:45.130
Who Slash Kapa Haka.
Is there any more things?

745
00:45:45.780 --> 00:45:47.320
Do we know anything more about the uh,

746
00:45:48.250 --> 00:45:50.910
that situation with Tabata about him slapping his girl around?

747
00:45:51.300 --> 00:45:56.010
Ethnicity is add dime piece.
I'll listen.
I thought at that time piece.
Yeah,

748
00:45:56.100 --> 00:45:58.490
it's a little bit what island you from?
[inaudible] island.
You know what?

749
00:45:58.500 --> 00:46:02.660
I'm a little confused about why she didn't go to the cops because she said on

750
00:46:02.670 --> 00:46:05.610
Instagram what she said.
So all these are allegations.
First of all,

751
00:46:05.611 --> 00:46:07.480
there's been no charges press.

752
00:46:07.481 --> 00:46:09.320
And she said the reason she came out on Instagram's,

753
00:46:09.340 --> 00:46:12.660
cause she doesn't want Travis to get arrested,

754
00:46:12.661 --> 00:46:16.380
loses career or get his kids taken away from him.
She said he's a good guy.

755
00:46:16.381 --> 00:46:20.220
He just whooped her ass,
which to me would mean you're not a good guy.
Well,
good.

756
00:46:20.310 --> 00:46:23.270
At least she did that.
I mean,
at least she had to get away and said,
I mean,
yeah,

757
00:46:23.310 --> 00:46:25.590
hopefully she's safe now.
To me it's,
it's crazy.

758
00:46:25.591 --> 00:46:28.740
The people with the comments like,
Oh,
you,
you whoa.

759
00:46:28.741 --> 00:46:30.960
Like why would you do this to him up?
Take it.

760
00:46:30.961 --> 00:46:34.590
You don't to get beat up by Travis Browne.
I do.
I do.

761
00:46:34.600 --> 00:46:36.780
And I didn't have the balls.

762
00:46:36.781 --> 00:46:41.640
Don't show my bruises on Instagram and he beat the shit out of me and I tell you

763
00:46:41.641 --> 00:46:44.310
what,
she probably put up a better fight.
Oh my gosh.

764
00:46:44.790 --> 00:46:47.820
She probably put a better fight then she got to use weapons down twice.

765
00:46:48.090 --> 00:46:53.010
I took them down twice.
Almost broke my neck.
Yeah.
What can you do,

766
00:46:53.011 --> 00:46:57.810
man?
He's a monster.
Can you imagine that guy hit you hard?
Holy Shit.

767
00:46:57.960 --> 00:47:01.290
Can you imagine that guy hit and hit and hit and that girl was then dime piece.

768
00:47:01.420 --> 00:47:05.250
Oh,
I use that term a lot,
Bobby.
Too much.

769
00:47:05.550 --> 00:47:08.700
I don't even know what it means.
Hot piece.

770
00:47:08.770 --> 00:47:13.640
You're a 10 he's a dime piece.
Mm.
No,
I wouldn't call him A.
Dot.

771
00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:18.930
Dennis Bermudez.
Yes.
Here's my question also.
So if you're Robbie law,

772
00:47:18.990 --> 00:47:20.970
if you're a Robbie Lawler and Rory Macdonald,

773
00:47:21.330 --> 00:47:25.980
if you ask me what they're thinking,
I'm saying you've got to stay warm,

774
00:47:26.010 --> 00:47:28.980
but the problem is you can't warm up too much because you don't know.

775
00:47:29.170 --> 00:47:32.260
Do they know what around when they're going to find out exactly around.
They do.

776
00:47:32.261 --> 00:47:34.750
Especially if you're coke or Maine or if you're on the main card.

777
00:47:34.751 --> 00:47:37.990
So you know you have a very good idea.
You can time when you start,

778
00:47:38.040 --> 00:47:40.870
you don't have an idea because especially when Bert was in the back,

779
00:47:40.871 --> 00:47:42.940
I don't know how it's run now.
I haven't fought since Bert left.

780
00:47:42.941 --> 00:47:45.670
So when Bert was in the back there,
you'd say,
Bert,
when I'm up and he'd say,

781
00:47:45.671 --> 00:47:49.840
you're up around eight 30 so you won't be ready around,
you know,
Short,

782
00:47:49.841 --> 00:47:54.160
warm up around seven 45 eight yeah.
I have a dumb question.
Well,

783
00:47:54.161 --> 00:47:57.460
why do you do that warm up?
Yeah,
I would just like not move at all.

784
00:47:57.910 --> 00:48:01.770
It's a bad idea.
Why do you want your body,
your body ready for?
No,

785
00:48:01.820 --> 00:48:05.430
I don't want to exert energy now.
You're not worried about that yet.

786
00:48:05.710 --> 00:48:08.260
Like optimum contraction.
Preach girl.

787
00:48:09.690 --> 00:48:14.690
Failed your way up to optimally stretch and or shorts even.

788
00:48:15.650 --> 00:48:18.350
Talk to me like that again on a podcast.
I will kill you.

789
00:48:20.320 --> 00:48:23.680
I'll fucking question.
All right.
Take it easy,
man.

790
00:48:24.130 --> 00:48:27.510
I thought you said you were a wrestler.
How can you have wrestled competitively?

791
00:48:29.110 --> 00:48:32.070
Just kind of showed up and I did it.
He'd scallops on the map.

792
00:48:33.290 --> 00:48:37.330
What the yellow stone did you do sports?
I was a swimmer for 15 years.

793
00:48:38.890 --> 00:48:41.860
Where did you,
where were for the Philippine national team.

794
00:48:44.800 --> 00:48:49.590
Athletes are talking how much you take [inaudible] I guess you got yourself a

795
00:48:49.591 --> 00:48:52.580
new,
a new girlfriend.
Dammit.

796
00:48:54.160 --> 00:48:58.340
Philippine national team.
Holy Mother of Lord.
Wow,
that's right.

797
00:48:58.650 --> 00:49:02.050
You know who I met recently and had dinner with with summer.
Uh,

798
00:49:02.080 --> 00:49:06.920
she was an Olympian and summer Sanders.
Yes.
Yes.
She's great.
Great Story.
I said,

799
00:49:07.730 --> 00:49:11.750
I said,
[inaudible] you swim.

800
00:49:13.020 --> 00:49:15.670
I said,
this is so funny.
Her husband.
I said,
first thing I said,

801
00:49:15.671 --> 00:49:19.630
her husband as I go,
I go,
um,
uh,
he looked like he was in shape.
I go,

802
00:49:19.631 --> 00:49:21.730
you look like your shape.
You'd work out.

803
00:49:21.880 --> 00:49:24.250
And he's about my age and my buddy goes to,
he's,
uh,

804
00:49:24.400 --> 00:49:28.180
he's been on three Olympic teams.
He's one of the greatest skiers up all time.
Oh,

805
00:49:28.181 --> 00:49:31.690
right.
Okay.
And then I,
then I see her,
I don't know if she's married,

806
00:49:31.720 --> 00:49:35.050
literally swear to God,
you know,
I like this.
I go,
got some arms on you,
man.

807
00:49:35.050 --> 00:49:38.570
Your arms look good.
You look like you stay in shape.
Uh,
Brian,
she's,
uh,

808
00:49:38.620 --> 00:49:43.270
she's one of the fucking greatest swimmers.
I want to goals one,

809
00:49:43.271 --> 00:49:47.500
two golds.
I think so.
Yeah.
She stayed in shape to like Dara Torres.

810
00:49:47.501 --> 00:49:50.180
Have you seen her body there in her forties?
The swimmers,

811
00:49:50.530 --> 00:49:54.910
swimmers big dough too much.
Too much.
You're biting off too much.

812
00:49:54.911 --> 00:49:57.410
They're not as big as she is about five,
eight.

813
00:49:57.420 --> 00:49:59.320
But the new age swimmers that you see now,

814
00:49:59.560 --> 00:50:03.310
especially butterfly or missy Franklin,
Loren Landow trends,
missy Franklin,

815
00:50:03.311 --> 00:50:05.890
she was 16 when I met her big girl.

816
00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:09.130
And she's the Michael Phelps.
The girls?
Yes.
Yeah,

817
00:50:09.610 --> 00:50:13.410
she was in college and she's out now and she's just making millions off
sponsors.

818
00:50:13.550 --> 00:50:17.410
She was in college I think for a year or two.
Cow.
Yeah.
Beast.

819
00:50:17.980 --> 00:50:21.080
This is a great fight.
Really good fats doing steroids right there.

820
00:50:21.110 --> 00:50:22.960
That his corner man,
first of all,

821
00:50:22.961 --> 00:50:26.390
his corner man should be a commercial or Tlt,

822
00:50:26.900 --> 00:50:30.620
TRT and balding,
although in the very back is a good buddy,

823
00:50:30.621 --> 00:50:35.330
Ryan Parsons who is jail sones coach Dan Henderson's the list goes on.

824
00:50:35.330 --> 00:50:38.900
He was the head coach at um,
in Temecula for all those guys.

825
00:50:39.480 --> 00:50:43.760
Bob based,
super beast.
He was on I think a six or seven fight win streak.

826
00:50:43.761 --> 00:50:46.580
And then he lost alumnus.
But he's a monster.

827
00:50:47.210 --> 00:50:48.560
I was telling him when he had six fights,

828
00:50:48.561 --> 00:50:52.250
you need to start squealing like a little baby pig for a title shot.

829
00:50:52.280 --> 00:50:56.420
You want six in a row,
son.
Where are we doing?
When is,
when is,

830
00:50:56.870 --> 00:51:00.160
when is a guy named Dan [inaudible] going to get his shot next.
Thanks.

831
00:51:00.170 --> 00:51:01.160
Guaranteed the next shot.

832
00:51:01.240 --> 00:51:04.820
But he wants to fight before that and we dialed shill Jerry,
right?
No,

833
00:51:04.821 --> 00:51:08.490
he fought a Modesto.
Oh God.

834
00:51:09.180 --> 00:51:11.270
He said you get nervous.
He goes like,
what?
He goes,

835
00:51:11.271 --> 00:51:14.340
I've all every every time and he's just,
of course he gets nervous.
Yeah,

836
00:51:14.540 --> 00:51:17.570
but he is,
he looks like the car.
So look at me.
Everyone gets,

837
00:51:17.580 --> 00:51:20.150
he just looked so gay man,
and he looks so gained.
All of them do.

838
00:51:20.151 --> 00:51:23.450
Look at Jeremy Stevens.
Lou We went to,
they show Jeremy Stephens.

839
00:51:23.630 --> 00:51:26.700
He looks like he's having the time was like somebody has or haven't finalized.

840
00:51:26.810 --> 00:51:30.000
They're nervous,
but they're having the time and the lights.
Check out.
Southpaw,

841
00:51:30.001 --> 00:51:34.130
official sponsor.
Speak in a south.
Paul,

Give me on the phone.

842
00:51:34.170 --> 00:51:37.370
The kid this week seen the movie cause I need to see it.
I need to see it too.

843
00:51:37.371 --> 00:51:40.370
Then wants to go to the open tomorrow.
Let's go see him Monday.
Can you go?

844
00:51:40.470 --> 00:51:44.900
I can't do it on Monday.
I'm most the only premier that we're forming Monday

845
00:51:46.790 --> 00:51:49.940
as in singing a song with a band.
Have you done the Goddamn comedy jam?

846
00:51:50.070 --> 00:51:53.450
And they've asked me a thousand times,
what song would you sing,
Bobby?
I said,

847
00:51:53.451 --> 00:51:56.330
know what song would you say that having a song,
I'm singing,

848
00:51:56.900 --> 00:51:58.850
I'm singing Mahler by dancing and I'm not ready.

849
00:51:58.890 --> 00:52:03.050
Can you give us a sambo children nutter.
Look,
Ma,

850
00:52:03.620 --> 00:52:07.410
I'm not mad at that.
Tell your children not to hear my words.

851
00:52:07.970 --> 00:52:12.680
What the say Mumbo.
I'll give you $500 filings,
walkout song.
That is,

852
00:52:12.800 --> 00:52:15.400
and I fought him.
Oh Shit.
Fucking real knowledge.

853
00:52:15.410 --> 00:52:20.300
I know what that's going to give it away.
It's Gabriel Gonzaga.

854
00:52:22.470 --> 00:52:26.960
Yeah.
Terrifying.
Terrifying.
He beat him.
I beat him.

855
00:52:26.961 --> 00:52:28.820
Put on a box boxing clinic.
Use My jab.

856
00:52:28.821 --> 00:52:32.210
Used my reach that you always talks about and that we're not talking about

857
00:52:32.211 --> 00:52:35.480
shitty gins out who we're talking about good guns.
That he's a beast.

858
00:52:35.510 --> 00:52:39.280
That was four or five years ago,
right after he beat cro cop.
Right?

859
00:52:39.310 --> 00:52:43.640
You find I'd be a cro cop.
No,
I beat,
I beat Gonzaga and I fought cro cop.

860
00:52:43.730 --> 00:52:47.930
I fought Gonzaga after he lost her junior dos Santos.
Here we go,
guys.
Here we go.

861
00:52:48.360 --> 00:52:50.750
Mother,
look at Jeremy Stephens.

862
00:52:50.840 --> 00:52:55.420
Tell your children not long hallway you.
I could do backup vocals if you want to.

863
00:52:55.421 --> 00:52:58.130
You could and I'd like you to,
well,
it was actually,
actually,

864
00:52:58.131 --> 00:53:00.290
I want you to come because maybe I'll have you come up there and so we were

865
00:53:00.291 --> 00:53:05.130
supposed to win.
Here is the favorite,
but it's close.
I think Bermuda is,

866
00:53:05.131 --> 00:53:07.580
is a,
hey,
he's a pretty heavily favorite for us.

867
00:53:07.581 --> 00:53:11.510
We're talking to them and man Mabo I don't want to,

868
00:53:13.620 --> 00:53:17.930
Karen,
you're keeping man the dog for live.
Get you had him from the way.

869
00:53:17.960 --> 00:53:20.290
They ain't Whoa,
oh,

870
00:53:20.470 --> 00:53:24.800
oh big right hand in someone's bleeding.

871
00:53:24.801 --> 00:53:25.890
And it's Jeremy Stephens

872
00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:30.660
<v 1>that looked like he got it from a headbutt trains at alliance in San Diego.</v>

873
00:53:30.870 --> 00:53:34.600
He's a beast.
Super hard hitter.
Crazy knockout artist.

874
00:53:35.790 --> 00:53:39.730
That upper cut,
was that a left or a right upper cut burn?
Uh,

875
00:53:39.920 --> 00:53:43.620
it looked like a right and now,
Ooh,
we got ourselves a real,

876
00:53:44.560 --> 00:53:47.340
it's what I call it,
dog five.
Brendan,
you say dog fun.
I say talk,
fight.

877
00:53:47.520 --> 00:53:50.000
Cockfight dog fight.
You know what kind of fun?

878
00:53:50.040 --> 00:53:52.290
I'm glad I don't have to do this for a living.
It's just so scary.

879
00:53:52.470 --> 00:53:53.730
I can't believe you've done this for eight years,

880
00:53:54.570 --> 00:53:55.403
<v 3>right?</v>

881
00:53:56.040 --> 00:53:58.560
<v 1>I'm gonna have to,
I'm gonna have to force her retirement.
I can't have it.</v>

882
00:53:58.561 --> 00:54:00.630
You're going to force them to retire.
I can't have it.
I just can't.

883
00:54:00.631 --> 00:54:02.850
I can't have you and I do have the greatest job in the world now.

884
00:54:02.930 --> 00:54:05.220
I can't cast when the shit.
Um,

885
00:54:05.790 --> 00:54:10.110
did anyone see the video of Rogan that he Instagram out training with Mark Della

886
00:54:10.111 --> 00:54:14.310
grotty hitting myths have,
did you see him kick?
Yes.

887
00:54:14.430 --> 00:54:15.420
Body have these cases.

888
00:54:15.660 --> 00:54:20.650
Joe Rogan kick kicks are scene us all though.

889
00:54:20.651 --> 00:54:24.480
Shit like he was kicking I text.
I was like,
Jesus Christ man.
Relax on the kicks.

890
00:54:24.481 --> 00:54:28.050
Crazy.
It's crazy.
It's his hips are so loose.

891
00:54:28.680 --> 00:54:32.500
Della grotty can see game.
He's 48 kicking him and he can do both sides.
Yeah.

892
00:54:33.360 --> 00:54:36.090
Pretty impressive.
Yeah.
How about this fight though?

893
00:54:38.670 --> 00:54:42.530
Silence.
Everyone was thinking about throwing those kicks since he was 14.

894
00:54:42.540 --> 00:54:44.550
We did taekwondo at a high level.

895
00:54:44.640 --> 00:54:47.160
I've been throwing those kicks with since he was 14 I would,

896
00:54:47.220 --> 00:54:51.180
I would pay money to have Joe kick in.
Like I don't,
I don't want that.
Oh know.

897
00:54:51.330 --> 00:54:55.940
I want you to have a kick off our 2015 kickoff.

898
00:54:56.230 --> 00:54:59.550
Brian Cal and Joe Rogan.
It's a kickoff racks a little bit.

899
00:55:00.570 --> 00:55:03.420
What do you think your hardest kick my Aussie Rogan's is?

900
00:55:03.421 --> 00:55:05.580
That [inaudible] will kick cause I knocked a lot of guys out with it.

901
00:55:06.030 --> 00:55:09.090
They weren't athletes,
but oh,
here we go.
Here it is.

902
00:55:09.150 --> 00:55:12.950
Look at Joe Rogan up here on the screen.
Kicking like a,

903
00:55:13.440 --> 00:55:17.520
Oh my God.
Now Watch.
Now what's impressive is he can switch.

904
00:55:17.521 --> 00:55:20.520
Watch what's Tele grotty.
Who's a world class coach.

905
00:55:20.550 --> 00:55:23.350
One of the best in the business.
Look watches.
Oof.

906
00:55:24.360 --> 00:55:28.920
Oh my God.
Left and right.
That's rare man.
He's a beast.

907
00:55:29.040 --> 00:55:32.160
I gotta pee again.
Brian.
He's scared.

908
00:55:37.620 --> 00:55:38.420
<v 3>Okay.</v>

909
00:55:38.420 --> 00:55:43.230
<v 1>You think they'd ever have a kickoff?
Jamie?
Never.
Never break.</v>

910
00:55:43.660 --> 00:55:47.190
Well,
Brian said he knocked a lot of guys that was spinning.
Kick I call bullshit.

911
00:55:47.210 --> 00:55:51.610
Brian's in the bathroom right now.
So we're just going to call bullshit Rogan.

912
00:55:51.650 --> 00:55:54.080
I actually competed.
Damn.
See,
oh my God.
Think God.

913
00:55:54.110 --> 00:55:58.610
I opened up from a headbutt it cause I didn't see an actual know and he's trying

914
00:55:58.611 --> 00:56:02.750
to set up or a head arm choke here trying to choke.
When do you stop it though?

915
00:56:02.751 --> 00:56:05.630
Like when day,
if it runs into the ice,

916
00:56:05.650 --> 00:56:09.390
when the stop is really fits under the eye continue.
No matter how big this,

917
00:56:09.650 --> 00:56:12.890
well it depends on what the doctor things,

918
00:56:12.891 --> 00:56:14.780
but if it's over the I can run into,

919
00:56:14.790 --> 00:56:17.810
it's a tough spot up there is not two x two and dropped down.

920
00:56:17.811 --> 00:56:20.360
It's not gonna run into that.
But when it starts running the eye,
yeah,

921
00:56:20.390 --> 00:56:24.250
you're in trouble a lot of times too.
It's on Fox and has a lot of blood.
You,

922
00:56:24.340 --> 00:56:27.220
you're playing a dangerous game.
Fox doesn't want all that blood.

923
00:56:27.221 --> 00:56:31.630
You have to think about it.
Talking about the regular folk.
Oh.
Oh.

924
00:56:32.830 --> 00:56:36.400
Tell you what Dan Scott Brock and really turned it on here.

925
00:56:39.280 --> 00:56:41.710
He just looked at the clock.
I don't like when they look at the clock.

926
00:56:41.770 --> 00:56:46.150
It's a bad sign actually.
Very good that these phenomenal fight.
Yeah.
Oh,

927
00:56:46.180 --> 00:56:50.650
exactly what the UFC needed.
Oh,
snaps.
Oh my God.

928
00:56:50.710 --> 00:56:53.220
I tell you what,
Joe Silva and Dana White during this match make,

929
00:56:53.221 --> 00:56:55.600
and they knew exactly what they were doing.

930
00:56:55.840 --> 00:56:59.950
Every single fight that they put on this card brings the eight.

931
00:57:00.790 --> 00:57:04.570
It's exactly what you need,
especially when you got all eyes on Conor McGregor.

932
00:57:04.571 --> 00:57:06.490
So people are tuned in for the first time,
I think,

933
00:57:06.491 --> 00:57:09.550
just to see what this Conor Mcgregor Fella's about.

934
00:57:09.880 --> 00:57:11.470
So you've got the Reebok kits,

935
00:57:11.650 --> 00:57:16.270
you got these monsters slang in the gloves.
It's exactly what they needed.

936
00:57:16.600 --> 00:57:19.630
Good for them.
Great Grand.
Wonderful.

937
00:57:19.780 --> 00:57:22.660
Yet 10 octagon girls just in case

938
00:57:24.680 --> 00:57:27.790
count.
Who's your fate?
Rock young girl.
You guys have a favorite ad?
The one,

939
00:57:27.791 --> 00:57:32.390
I don't know her name.
Brittany baller.
Nope.
Nope.
Uh,

940
00:57:32.530 --> 00:57:36.480
there's enough.
She's American.
She's on this car.
She American,
I think so.

941
00:57:36.660 --> 00:57:39.970
Brunette with beautiful body.
Well,
we sit beautiful body.

942
00:57:40.610 --> 00:57:45.480
You illustrated big jugs.
I did,
I guess,
but she's,
they all have nice legs.

943
00:57:46.030 --> 00:57:49.120
She looks like she,
her,
she Brazil.
No,
we're,

944
00:57:49.130 --> 00:57:53.590
I'll tell you who's the sleepers that Carly Baker from England.
God,

945
00:57:53.620 --> 00:57:57.550
look her up.
Carly Baker brings the heat.
Well,
Jay,

946
00:57:57.551 --> 00:58:01.990
James gonna.
Bring it up for you.
Carly Baker.
Carly banker brings the,

947
00:58:02.190 --> 00:58:05.110
hey.
Oh,

948
00:58:05.200 --> 00:58:09.670
she could make me a crumpet anytime.
Go ahead and look at her fell.
Soak that in.

949
00:58:09.671 --> 00:58:11.910
I want you to soak that.
Not Mad.
And in person.

950
00:58:11.920 --> 00:58:16.000
She is a smoke show spectacular in 2000 definitely not mad at her at all.

951
00:58:16.180 --> 00:58:21.070
How could you be?
Why would you be my Lord?
Have mercy on me.
Yes.
Lock me up.

952
00:58:21.280 --> 00:58:24.790
Throw away the key.
Now let me see that.
Let me see.
There's another one I want to,

953
00:58:24.890 --> 00:58:29.340
if you don't know her name,
it's hard to look up in it.
But the USC girls,
no,

954
00:58:29.500 --> 00:58:33.670
Brian crossed up caught it because I just don't like when they do.

955
00:58:33.671 --> 00:58:35.800
Dumb post is like that.
I'm always,
oh,
I know.

956
00:58:35.801 --> 00:58:38.410
I can't stand when they stand provocative like that in the post pictures.

957
00:58:38.411 --> 00:58:42.310
That's so lane said.
The only gay guy in the room.
Oh,

958
00:58:43.150 --> 00:58:45.820
such a rough sport.
There was a head,
but you're right.

959
00:58:45.821 --> 00:58:48.870
That was a headbutt for sure it,
but yeah.
Oh,

960
00:58:48.880 --> 00:58:53.530
she's got set of knockers on her too.
Hey Bro,
take it easy man.

961
00:58:53.560 --> 00:58:56.600
Nice girl too.
Very nice.
She could.

962
00:58:56.630 --> 00:58:59.800
It's Britney Palmer sugary cereal because Brittney Palmer there tonight or is

963
00:58:59.801 --> 00:59:04.540
she taking self defense classes too much?
Is that too much?

964
00:59:05.140 --> 00:59:09.550
Too much silence in the room.
I didn't get it till it's just now.

965
00:59:10.060 --> 00:59:14.890
It's funny.
By the way,
Mister Bermuda says not slow down.
Slow down at all.

966
00:59:15.040 --> 00:59:19.190
He's a phenomenal coach and he hurt his leg like bad hurt him.
Oh,

967
00:59:19.220 --> 00:59:22.400
that might be a knee.
It looks like it's buckling a little for sure.

968
00:59:22.401 --> 00:59:26.420
While he still threw it.
Ooh.
It might've been shitting on shift sometimes.

969
00:59:26.421 --> 00:59:30.560
That'll take a little while.
Steven's recognizes it.
He sees it now.
Yeah.

970
00:59:30.890 --> 00:59:35.060
Trouble.
Trouble in little China.

971
00:59:36.020 --> 00:59:39.770
A lot of places.
You're over your phone.
He's got Jesus on the side,

972
00:59:39.771 --> 00:59:43.150
which I didn't realize so I'm going to,
Steven seems he's got tattoos.

973
00:59:43.190 --> 00:59:47.550
He's got holy ghost power.
First of all,
Jesus on bolts.
Oh,

974
00:59:48.270 --> 00:59:53.270
oh,
oh,
oh fuck.
Oh.
Dennis Bermudez.

975
00:59:53.300 --> 00:59:57.680
One tough son of a watch.
Good sprung out.
He's in trouble.

976
00:59:57.700 --> 01:00:02.540
He's in big trouble.
If he lands take down,
it's going to be fine day.

977
01:00:02.570 --> 01:00:05.890
What?
Great fights.
I can't remember that stolen card was this guest crazy.

978
01:00:06.110 --> 01:00:09.470
I can't.
Last time I was this excited for card.
A little Asian people down there.

979
01:00:11.990 --> 01:00:16.310
Joe Rogan,
the bottom right there.
There's some empty seats in there.

980
01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:19.160
That's interesting,
right?
Well maybe the ground snacks.

981
01:00:19.161 --> 01:00:21.740
Brian could be grabbing snacks.
Brendan,
this is the first fight.

982
01:00:21.741 --> 01:00:24.170
I felt like that's the third.

983
01:00:24.250 --> 01:00:27.300
He's that that knee is not doing well.
That,

984
01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:29.870
I don't know if it's his knee or shin.
He's definitely messed up though.

985
01:00:30.110 --> 01:00:33.230
He's definitely in trouble.
Three round fight,
right?
Yes,
sir.

986
01:00:34.370 --> 01:00:36.260
Out You can see is in trouble.
Same dre.

987
01:00:36.261 --> 01:00:39.980
Steven knows it and he keeps kicking there.
Jeremy seems to do it inside Kik

988
01:00:41.720 --> 01:00:43.220
because it's there because he's not moving.

989
01:00:44.030 --> 01:00:48.560
You're not mad at the way those uh Oh you don't manage is tight shorts.

990
01:00:48.561 --> 01:00:52.550
Brian Dennis fills those things like,
oh,

991
01:00:53.050 --> 01:00:56.480
his legs messed up.
He's not knocked down his legs giving out on him.
Yeah.

992
01:00:56.510 --> 01:01:01.190
His leg is in some serious trouble.
Oh Man.
It was a nice,

993
01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:06.390
good,
good Greg Mowgli.
Go Google him away.
Oh Great.

994
01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:09.890
He can take a sharp kid meets his leg,
man.

995
01:01:10.010 --> 01:01:11.930
So it's looking worse than it is when you can be.
He can't.

996
01:01:11.931 --> 01:01:14.450
He can't put weight on it.
So when he gets here,
he's off balance.

997
01:01:14.451 --> 01:01:18.270
He's falling down.
This is spot.

998
01:01:18.560 --> 01:01:21.740
That's why you see that was such damn good.
Lord.

999
01:01:21.741 --> 01:01:24.200
This is a violent filing situation.

1000
01:01:26.480 --> 01:01:30.710
Blood.
I know what Stephen's is hurt.
How about that?
Now Stevens has hurt.

1001
01:01:30.860 --> 01:01:33.200
Bermuda says,
hey,
based.
Hey,
good luck.

1002
01:01:33.201 --> 01:01:36.590
Given fight of the night out performance of the night with all these fights

1003
01:01:36.591 --> 01:01:40.910
tonight.
You know what?
That ring smells like Serena Williams.
It's fucked up.

1004
01:01:43.540 --> 01:01:48.500
Turtle boy.
Oh Man.
That's so you're saying Serena smells like the octagon?

1005
01:01:48.530 --> 01:01:53.510
Yeah.
Hmm.
Hmm.
You're awful baby.
Come on Bobby.

1006
01:01:55.670 --> 01:01:58.080
Racism.
It's nothing.
It's just an observation.
Yeah.

1007
01:01:58.100 --> 01:01:59.480
Like some people smell like shit.

1008
01:02:00.750 --> 01:02:05.210
Oh you give me a high five marine.
You're not you.
You can cut this out.

1009
01:02:06.080 --> 01:02:07.160
I thought that was a karate chop.

1010
01:02:12.530 --> 01:02:15.060
Karate Chop.
That's a salt.

1011
01:02:15.950 --> 01:02:19.380
Oh good Lord.
Oh boy.

1012
01:02:20.310 --> 01:02:22.140
This is an amazing fighter.
Amazing flight.

1013
01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:26.910
This is the best way we've seen tonight.
Offset harm.
Sat and Brendan,
you're not,

1014
01:02:26.940 --> 01:02:30.570
you're not wrong in saying this guy should be con.
This guy is a huge threat.

1015
01:02:30.600 --> 01:02:34.390
He's as good as anybody I've seen in the 45 pounds of Bermuda's.
Yeah.
Hell yeah.

1016
01:02:34.500 --> 01:02:39.000
Him and Connor would go,
oh my God.
Well,
let,
the thing is guys so durable,

1017
01:02:39.001 --> 01:02:43.740
this weight classmates can't sleep on anyone.
Oh,
he's doing this on one leg.

1018
01:02:43.741 --> 01:02:46.890
You can see you can't really push off on this.
Take down.
Wow.

1019
01:02:47.370 --> 01:02:50.430
Look at his meathead.
Going to look at them.
There's the odd young girls.

1020
01:02:50.520 --> 01:02:55.290
Every 2012 of them are cheap to fly them in it.
His UFC fight week though.

1021
01:02:55.920 --> 01:02:58.980
It is.
It's important tomorrow,
right?
Yeah.

1022
01:02:58.981 --> 01:03:01.980
There is the ultimate fighter finale.
Jake Ellenberger,

1023
01:03:01.981 --> 01:03:04.320
Stephen Wonderboy Thompson,
your main event.

1024
01:03:04.350 --> 01:03:08.280
These boys are fricking durable Europe.

1025
01:03:08.300 --> 01:03:11.730
These boys are working.
Um,
I'll tell you the best,

1026
01:03:11.850 --> 01:03:16.850
the most excited fight I'm looking forward to on tomorrow's card is Michelle

1027
01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:18.750
Waterson.
If anyone knows who Michelle Waterson,

1028
01:03:18.751 --> 01:03:22.050
it's their first fight in the UFC.
She was fighting Vic that one 15.

1029
01:03:22.051 --> 01:03:26.440
She's a little beast.
She's awesome.
Oh,

1030
01:03:26.520 --> 01:03:30.120
Jackson member.
The cyborg thing.
Pick the fights.

1031
01:03:30.180 --> 01:03:34.770
I did see Cyborg.
She knocked that ground like 40 seconds.
Then called Rhonda Out,

1032
01:03:35.190 --> 01:03:38.520
but you know what she does now?
She said she called me.
She stayed out and said,

1033
01:03:38.521 --> 01:03:40.490
meet me at one 40 I think that's what's going to happen.

1034
01:03:40.491 --> 01:03:42.750
Just make one 35 and shut the fuck up.

1035
01:03:42.751 --> 01:03:46.110
How can you call out a champion and not walk?
Go down to her weight group.

1036
01:03:47.970 --> 01:03:50.670
Well then you can't call her out.
Then you can't call her out.
Then guess what?

1037
01:03:50.671 --> 01:03:55.080
It's not for you.
Move on now is a business to say,
find me a catch weight,
Laura,

1038
01:03:55.120 --> 01:03:58.170
that that wouldn't make sense for Rhonda because it's like,
no,

1039
01:03:58.200 --> 01:04:00.050
there's no crap for Rhonda guys,
guys.

1040
01:04:00.051 --> 01:04:04.080
She's the king or queen and I should shut this up Bob guys,
guys,

1041
01:04:04.950 --> 01:04:08.380
this fight is,
this fight is unbelievable.
Unbelievable album.

1042
01:04:08.490 --> 01:04:11.550
I don't understand how when I really don't understand,
I'm not being silly.

1043
01:04:11.551 --> 01:04:14.250
I don't understand how you can take those kinds of shots and keep going.

1044
01:04:14.251 --> 01:04:16.050
I don't know.
Yeah,
I mean,

1045
01:04:16.051 --> 01:04:20.700
especially Steve and Shama guy who was knocking dudes out at 55 and then cut

1046
01:04:20.701 --> 01:04:24.960
down to 45 which the same power.
I'll tell you what,
man,
his leg is.

1047
01:04:25.290 --> 01:04:29.670
Jag,
look at Bermuda's [inaudible] gang blood dope right now as we speak,

1048
01:04:29.671 --> 01:04:34.500
because he's just so easy.
He doesn't need to say you guys are the accusations.

1049
01:04:34.501 --> 01:04:38.320
My man,
he doesn't read.
Email is passed.
Every drug test.
[inaudible] leave it.

1050
01:04:38.321 --> 01:04:41.710
I'm just saying,
can't say drug dope house.
You see?
There it is.
There's that kick.

1051
01:04:42.730 --> 01:04:47.210
Ooh.
Ooh,
Ooh.
You know what?
Yeah,
he got dropped there.
Boom.

1052
01:04:47.440 --> 01:04:51.860
It's right on the fucking Shin on this chin.

1053
01:04:53.910 --> 01:04:58.320
Whooping like a neck one.
A loss.
Oh,

1054
01:04:58.321 --> 01:05:00.480
Mike Tyson with a terrible shirt.

1055
01:05:02.880 --> 01:05:07.740
By the way.
You're talking probably the hardest hitter ever.
He's up there.

1056
01:05:07.840 --> 01:05:11.550
It's a great fees up there.
People say George Foreman,
but Mike Tyson's up there.

1057
01:05:11.970 --> 01:05:13.650
I'll go with Tyson.
No,

1058
01:05:13.830 --> 01:05:17.370
actually they broke it down scientifically and George Foreman's number ones.

1059
01:05:17.650 --> 01:05:21.670
Hardest hitter as your boy,
your boy,
John Brenkus.
John Bray.
We go boys.

1060
01:05:22.030 --> 01:05:25.810
Here we go.
Here we go.
Here we go.
This is the fight of the night so far by far.

1061
01:05:25.840 --> 01:05:28.510
Hopefully these next ones.
Look at this,
bringing his leg around.

1062
01:05:29.630 --> 01:05:32.620
Bring us communities is a rough fuck.

1063
01:05:35.500 --> 01:05:36.290
Bobby,
I want you to take,

1064
01:05:36.290 --> 01:05:38.740
I want you to taking your writing more seriously after this hobby.

1065
01:05:38.840 --> 01:05:40.030
I want you to start training.

1066
01:05:40.170 --> 01:05:44.180
We're going to start training you to fight in the one 25 w how much do you
weigh?

1067
01:05:44.181 --> 01:05:48.760
170170270 oh,
snap these needs.

1068
01:05:48.761 --> 01:05:53.200
Do you need to stop it?
They didn't stop there.
Oh Wow.

1069
01:05:55.210 --> 01:05:59.920
I told you.
I told you went for Jeremy Scott.
Holy Shit.

1070
01:06:02.380 --> 01:06:06.440
Holy Shit.
Good Lord.
Just spitting bloke.

1071
01:06:06.470 --> 01:06:08.200
We get to point out Mike Tyson.

1072
01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:15.460
Wow.
What a freaking fight.
Damn.
And there's Tyson.

1073
01:06:15.461 --> 01:06:19.870
He is not that now.
Highlight of his life right there.
Right in front of Tyson.

1074
01:06:21.130 --> 01:06:25.060
Wow.
That's amazing.
Amazing.

1075
01:06:28.070 --> 01:06:29.630
Damn he is crunk too.

1076
01:06:30.330 --> 01:06:34.190
They tell him to jump on the icon or if you jump out of it,

1077
01:06:34.191 --> 01:06:37.130
you're going to get fined.
What don't,
I mean no one ever gets fined really

1078
01:06:38.700 --> 01:06:42.410
on it in Toronto and they didn't do anything.
He got so excited.
Well,
yeah.

1079
01:06:42.411 --> 01:06:46.910
Everyone gets excited.
Oh,
it's over it.
How do you time that?

1080
01:06:47.220 --> 01:06:52.190
Ah,
Oh,
you know,

1081
01:06:52.191 --> 01:06:56.840
I'm practicing knees from now on.
Holy smokes

1082
01:06:58.470 --> 01:07:01.790
making it.
You use it.
You use it at the end of the fight.

1083
01:07:01.850 --> 01:07:06.070
They should stop the fuck way.
Way Too many shots mentioned needs tonight.
Right?

1084
01:07:06.071 --> 01:07:10.640
The last fight.
What a beautiful,
what a beautiful move.

1085
01:07:10.730 --> 01:07:14.570
Look at his corner men whistling out.
Look at him.
Yeah.

1086
01:07:14.600 --> 01:07:18.400
Late reaction and wow,
dude.
He,
he's,
he,
that's his,

1087
01:07:18.800 --> 01:07:22.280
that's his thing by the way.
Steven says is a striker first and then he's,

1088
01:07:22.290 --> 01:07:26.960
I'm knocked out artists.
Yeah.
He knocks dude's out.
Dennis Dennis,
his background,

1089
01:07:26.961 --> 01:07:31.280
his boxing,
but he does it all.
That was a phenomenal fight.

1090
01:07:33.020 --> 01:07:36.920
Excuse me.
I have to go to the bathroom.
Uh,
Bobby,
I'm going to help you.

1091
01:07:36.921 --> 01:07:40.220
I'm going to help hobby.
Hold on.
Help them.
I'm going to pull your pants down.

1092
01:07:40.550 --> 01:07:44.570
Dang.
Pull.
Hold your whiteness.
I hate seeing these guys lose pan.

1093
01:07:45.920 --> 01:07:48.110
It's so tough.
Jeremy is

1094
01:07:51.980 --> 01:07:56.600
what?
A feeling.
Look at the blood.
Look at that beast.

1095
01:07:57.950 --> 01:08:01.640
Wow.
He's a lot bigger than fucking Bermudez,
dude.
Well,
you still fight.

1096
01:08:01.641 --> 01:08:05.330
He was a big 55 are amazing.
Giant.
Knocked out artists.

1097
01:08:05.331 --> 01:08:08.420
Straight up head.
His biggest Joe Rogan's,
which is saying a lot.

1098
01:08:10.520 --> 01:08:11.353
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1099
01:08:11.500 --> 01:08:16.070
<v 1>Wow.
What a fight,
man.
Powerful Joe.
Breaking it</v>

1100
01:08:16.070 --> 01:08:16.903
<v 2>down here.</v>

1101
01:08:27.130 --> 01:08:28.470
<v 1>Boom,
dude.</v>

1102
01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:36.353
<v 2>What's that?</v>

1103
01:08:40.400 --> 01:08:41.233
<v 1>Oh</v>

1104
01:08:52.380 --> 01:08:53.213
yeah.

1105
01:08:56.280 --> 01:08:58.110
<v 2>Oh,
the larger losses were</v>

1106
01:09:12.330 --> 01:09:17.130
<v 1>24 11 he changed his career and went down the line,
so I trained in San Diego.</v>

1107
01:09:17.131 --> 01:09:20.730
All those boys.
That dude on the background,
I forget his name,

1108
01:09:20.731 --> 01:09:25.060
but he's a risk coach at.
He's one of the best wrestlers.
I mean,
got team.

1109
01:09:25.410 --> 01:09:28.910
The small white guy on the right.
There he is.
See Him.
Phenomenal coach.
Yeah.

1110
01:09:28.920 --> 01:09:29.753
Crazy coach.

1111
01:09:33.540 --> 01:09:34.373
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1112
01:09:35.190 --> 01:09:39.480
<v 1>Why don't feeling,
man?
What a great VOA five Oh five where's that?</v>

1113
01:09:40.020 --> 01:09:45.020
505-FIVE-OH-5505 why does it sound right now with Kirky,

1114
01:09:48.900 --> 01:09:52.990
Albuquerque,
Blue Yuk.
Brian [inaudible] boss in the hall of fame,

1115
01:09:53.220 --> 01:09:55.040
obviously Quirky.

1116
01:09:56.280 --> 01:09:59.370
How Albuquerque up sprays never went down to Jackson's if that's where he's at.

1117
01:09:59.371 --> 01:10:03.840
Huh?
What a beautiful,
what a beautiful performance that was.

1118
01:10:03.841 --> 01:10:07.350
That was brutal because that fight of the night so far,
by far,

1119
01:10:08.010 --> 01:10:10.100
by far you go,

1120
01:10:10.260 --> 01:10:13.710
you could go fight it than it will cause now they don't do they do performance

1121
01:10:13.711 --> 01:10:16.770
of the night so you could go performance the night knock on the night.

1122
01:10:16.771 --> 01:10:21.771
I mean that was the kiss for performance versus like submission of the night or

1123
01:10:22.861 --> 01:10:24.450
all the same now.
So it's all just,

1124
01:10:24.451 --> 01:10:28.620
they give out I think three performances in the night.
So no more specifics?
No,

1125
01:10:28.621 --> 01:10:33.430
no more specifics.
But you can win more than one.
I think the,

1126
01:10:33.450 --> 01:10:35.700
I forget the exact breakdown,
but it's all performance of the night.

1127
01:10:37.040 --> 01:10:37.820
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1128
01:10:37.820 --> 01:10:40.750
<v 1>And that's definitely performed.
Other than that,</v>

1129
01:10:43.930 --> 01:10:45.040
boom.

1130
01:10:47.210 --> 01:10:48.043
<v 2>Yikes.</v>

1131
01:10:50.400 --> 01:10:53.700
<v 1>The batch got this title shot by beating the other two,</v>

1132
01:10:53.820 --> 01:10:58.770
four horsemen are force horse,
women's,
and then the only one left,

1133
01:10:58.771 --> 01:11:03.771
the fight was marina and she just got completely annihilated and Invicta in like

1134
01:11:04.531 --> 01:11:08.460
40 seconds.
What's that?
You want me to reset?

1135
01:11:08.870 --> 01:11:11.230
Because you're not paying attention.
I'm watching it.
I love it.

1136
01:11:11.240 --> 01:11:15.440
I love these promos.
No,
well I'm glad someone gets a number.
What's your car?

1137
01:11:16.370 --> 01:11:19.260
You put your heads headset on.
What's your calling his fight.

1138
01:11:20.700 --> 01:11:22.260
I like asking you questions like this.

1139
01:11:22.860 --> 01:11:25.380
She does that and the skill set to show disappointing.
She can,

1140
01:11:25.381 --> 01:11:28.650
can't you see how she's chosen for?
Then she went to one,
right?

1141
01:11:28.710 --> 01:11:33.710
So she's beat two of the four horse women and then marina was the fourth of

1142
01:11:34.371 --> 01:11:36.340
finished off.
She just got dominated in victim.

1143
01:11:36.341 --> 01:11:41.330
She got like knocked down like 40 seconds,
some shit.
So Rhonda,

1144
01:11:41.340 --> 01:11:46.170
his entourage.
Really it's just,
it's,
it's very similar to the entourage,
right?

1145
01:11:46.171 --> 01:11:50.220
Like she's Vinnie chase and the rest of the turtle and so it's tough.

1146
01:11:50.670 --> 01:11:54.300
It's tough man.
Please don't say turtle.
Why?
I loved her,

1147
01:11:54.301 --> 01:11:57.530
but I'm just saying that it's true.
Like Ron is a superstar.
Gaffer.
Turtle.

1148
01:11:57.540 --> 01:12:01.350
He made the most money.
Yeah,
turtles balling.
You never know.
Look at that card.

1149
01:12:01.530 --> 01:12:02.920
Well yet.

1150
01:12:02.970 --> 01:12:07.970
Struve Nogueira Shogun and still find little nog and big Nog are on that card.

1151
01:12:08.190 --> 01:12:12.480
Hey fellas.
Hey fellas,
guys,
you got to stop.
Good.

1152
01:12:12.540 --> 01:12:17.420
They're still fighting.
God,
you fought big Nog right?
I did.
Okay.

1153
01:12:17.490 --> 01:12:19.890
She,
she knows her shit.
She does know her shit.

1154
01:12:21.160 --> 01:12:25.920
Noguera has it been around forever?
They are legends as an athlete,

1155
01:12:25.921 --> 01:12:30.230
I guess you follow these things,
but she's so that intense.
Hold on,
hold on,

1156
01:12:30.231 --> 01:12:33.420
hold on.
Did you say as an athlete,
Dave,
she follows these things.

1157
01:12:33.990 --> 01:12:37.230
So if you're an athlete,
you've know mixed martial arts,
I don't know,

1158
01:12:37.231 --> 01:12:41.430
I guess she has a more of an,
I guess she's a fan.
Look at Ronda.

1159
01:12:41.460 --> 01:12:45.180
Look at the Dee Dee and sanity.
How do you get that intensity?

1160
01:12:45.181 --> 01:12:50.181
How do you get that dead cruel that need to just destroy god?

1161
01:12:50.610 --> 01:12:54.180
Damn.
You're just now seeing this.
Yeah.

1162
01:12:54.210 --> 01:12:57.270
You've never seen these highlights before.
They play these every day,

1163
01:12:58.020 --> 01:13:01.830
but I just don't get over it.
Look at her.
No competition.

1164
01:13:01.860 --> 01:13:06.540
She's by far hands down the best female fighter ever.

1165
01:13:06.990 --> 01:13:08.940
Not even close.
I'm a pretty good female fighter.

1166
01:13:09.990 --> 01:13:12.360
She would beat you in under 30 seconds.

1167
01:13:13.080 --> 01:13:16.690
Not even close in anything.
Fighting,

1168
01:13:16.790 --> 01:13:21.360
fighting related hand for pound,
punching Joanna or her punching and kicking.
Ooo,

1169
01:13:21.361 --> 01:13:25.020
that's tough.
Punching can shoot dominate you.
Um,
pound for pound.

1170
01:13:25.620 --> 01:13:30.090
Yolana I think Yolanda is a better striker than Ronda because you know she's

1171
01:13:30.091 --> 01:13:34.140
like a six time Muay Thai world champion.
Yes.
So she,
that's her background.

1172
01:13:34.440 --> 01:13:38.560
Now if they were to fight and say,
your honor,
they did like some super fight,

1173
01:13:38.561 --> 01:13:41.190
a catch weight.
Renault dominator,
she tossed her on her face.

1174
01:13:41.600 --> 01:13:44.250
Just grab her and throw her in the air.
Rhonda Jujitsu,

1175
01:13:44.251 --> 01:13:46.600
some of the best in the world for crazy male or female.

1176
01:13:46.650 --> 01:13:51.360
Cris Cyborg has actually been,
um,
like in the,
you know those lion fights?

1177
01:13:51.380 --> 01:13:54.590
Yeah.
She's been beat up by a lot of Moitai girl.
She got mad.

1178
01:13:54.810 --> 01:13:58.320
She got stopped by one of the top Moy Thai girls.
Yeah.
Oh,
Cyborg.
Yeah,

1179
01:13:58.321 --> 01:14:01.530
I heard about that.
She got beat up.
I want them.
Yeah,
it was a while ago.

1180
01:14:01.830 --> 01:14:04.890
But again,
it's such a different thing,
right?
It is.

1181
01:14:05.070 --> 01:14:06.180
Is this guy fighting right now?

1182
01:14:10.070 --> 01:14:12.220
Bobby?
What is he fighting?

1183
01:14:12.580 --> 01:14:17.360
<v 0>Bobby Stetser woman.
Oh,
they did?
Oh,
sorry.
Come on.
Beth.
[inaudible].</v>

1184
01:14:17.500 --> 01:14:20.680
Ronda Rousey's fighting.
Oh,
that's great.
That's great.
That's great.

1185
01:14:20.860 --> 01:14:25.710
I'm looking forward to it.
He's this tall or is this Lawler?

1186
01:14:25.740 --> 01:14:28.540
Mcnall yeah,
I can barely take this right now.

1187
01:14:29.290 --> 01:14:32.530
You're about to see fighting at its highest.
This is the last one,
Brian.

1188
01:14:32.531 --> 01:14:35.100
The last flight was tiny.
Did was fighting him.

1189
01:14:35.980 --> 01:14:40.510
Watch your ps and Qs,
but you're watching too.
How'd you get this in here?

1190
01:14:40.520 --> 01:14:44.400
You're watching the two best welterweights in the world.
That's right.
Please,

1191
01:14:44.410 --> 01:14:48.100
please hook.
Cross caught it as,
as,
as right up there with them all.
But yeah,

1192
01:14:48.670 --> 01:14:53.110
I think got some work to do.
I didn't.
Carlos condit might be the the best.

1193
01:14:53.540 --> 01:14:55.390
The best fight.
I think he'd be to anybody.

1194
01:14:56.260 --> 01:14:59.460
I love Carlos Condit Tamsen though.

1195
01:14:59.500 --> 01:15:03.370
Just in terms of just like technicalities,
like very talented side.

1196
01:15:03.371 --> 01:15:05.590
Incredible has this getting this is getting good buzz.

1197
01:15:06.040 --> 01:15:10.150
Well it comes out July 24th Brian,
so it's not as good as the warrior.

1198
01:15:10.900 --> 01:15:14.590
Well it's called warrior,
but you're right bro.
You know what I saw last night?

1199
01:15:14.620 --> 01:15:19.560
The minions movie.
That's it.
Good.
I fell asleep.
Walked out.
It was terrible.

1200
01:15:19.570 --> 01:15:24.550
Kids.
Well No,
no.
Pixar movies.
I love those cartoon movies.

1201
01:15:24.551 --> 01:15:28.210
However,
the minions are cool when you see me like clips.
Right.

1202
01:15:28.211 --> 01:15:31.810
When like despicable me.
They're funny.
An entire movie of that.

1203
01:15:32.690 --> 01:15:35.680
Too much.
I agree with you way too much to be honest.
Me and my wife said,

1204
01:15:35.681 --> 01:15:38.370
come to the movies with me and the kids and I go,
what is it?
Many minivans.

1205
01:15:38.371 --> 01:15:42.130
And she went like this little yellow people and I went,
I can't do it.
Hey look,

1206
01:15:42.160 --> 01:15:45.010
can't do it.
Little yellow people for an hour and a half though,

1207
01:15:45.280 --> 01:15:47.470
I can sprinkle them either.
Dope is dispute me.

1208
01:15:47.480 --> 01:15:52.420
They're funny now forward that 40 minutes of pure yellow guys and he gets very

1209
01:15:52.421 --> 01:15:56.180
old now.
Now Shop Ben shop you and I have to say

1210
01:15:57.920 --> 01:16:02.850
guys got damn man.
It's like I'm right here.
Come on Bro.
Bobby,

1211
01:16:03.060 --> 01:16:03.893
he just

1212
01:16:05.990 --> 01:16:10.540
yellower animated characters and you are an animated character,

1213
01:16:10.541 --> 01:16:14.530
but still there was a movie about a lot of you.
I'd watch it.

1214
01:16:14.890 --> 01:16:18.950
Thank you that Sam,
Sam Tripoli's joke about losing Bobby.
He,

1215
01:16:19.600 --> 01:16:22.790
he lost Bobby at the Korean Day parade and he goes here.

1216
01:16:22.800 --> 01:16:24.670
We're trying to look for a Korean and a Korean parade.

1217
01:16:24.760 --> 01:16:29.560
It's like looking for a needle in a needle stack.
Fucking prize.

1218
01:16:29.960 --> 01:16:33.530
Fun Day though.
Yeah.
Yeah.
What did you get?

1219
01:16:33.660 --> 01:16:35.440
When are you going to come on the fighter and the kid would need you?

1220
01:16:35.710 --> 01:16:39.520
What is that?
Well,
it's the biggest deal.

1221
01:16:39.560 --> 01:16:43.890
You don't ask me whenever you ask me,
I show up.
I'm asking you right now.

1222
01:16:43.900 --> 01:16:46.480
I'm going to be there.
What is it,
bro?
Real quick.

1223
01:16:46.550 --> 01:16:48.800
Are these graphics or he doesn't want me look.
No,
no,

1224
01:16:48.810 --> 01:16:53.170
it's you're in 100% 100 we're friends now,
man.
I need your back.

1225
01:16:53.200 --> 01:16:56.320
He's taken us back to the fuck you this graphic,
the new UFC graphic man.

1226
01:16:56.350 --> 01:17:00.140
It's really dope.
No Mad.
Not Mad at it.
Way Cleaner.
Right.

1227
01:17:00.190 --> 01:17:05.020
You can see that in the arena.
Like basketball games.
Yes.
I don't know,

1228
01:17:05.110 --> 01:17:06.610
but I'm going to say I don't know either.

1229
01:17:06.760 --> 01:17:10.340
No you can't because you can you see the glare off the side of the pillars so

1230
01:17:10.341 --> 01:17:11.180
they can see it.
Yeah,

1231
01:17:11.440 --> 01:17:14.210
but I don't like how they're doing a Mashup of the final two fights.

1232
01:17:14.211 --> 01:17:19.211
They should do men or they should do Rory and Lawler and then when the other two

1233
01:17:19.491 --> 01:17:21.080
come out,
like why are we doing a masters?

1234
01:17:21.710 --> 01:17:24.980
I tell you why I want Conor Mcgregor to win and why I was so nervous.
He won't.

1235
01:17:25.010 --> 01:17:29.450
Is that that I don't want hit this,
this train,
train,
this gate.

1236
01:17:29.451 --> 01:17:30.620
This can either be the star.

1237
01:17:30.650 --> 01:17:34.070
I love Chad Mendez and of course he's one of the best guys in this amazing,

1238
01:17:34.190 --> 01:17:37.160
but I just,
I want this hype train of cotton.
I want the movie.

1239
01:17:37.161 --> 01:17:39.470
Keep on cause I don't want him to,
I don't want to see what he does.

1240
01:17:39.471 --> 01:17:42.830
May lose this going to be embarrassing and I'd be bummed everything's going to

1241
01:17:42.831 --> 01:17:44.380
be,
I'm loving my show up though.

1242
01:17:44.390 --> 01:17:48.050
The new UFC layout is fricking dope.

1243
01:17:48.320 --> 01:17:50.450
That was sweet man.
Look at that arena.

1244
01:17:51.210 --> 01:17:55.940
Dana Dana White said this is the craziest arena fight ever he's ever seen.

1245
01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:59.370
As far as fans,
everything.
What are we going to say,
Jamie?
Yeah,

1246
01:17:59.390 --> 01:18:02.450
jumbo tron in the middle.
I feel like it's not usually a above the ring.

1247
01:18:03.020 --> 01:18:03.860
I've been there a few times.

1248
01:18:03.861 --> 01:18:07.070
I feel like its own thing or they've had it there but they always had it like he

1249
01:18:07.071 --> 01:18:10.110
had to look far away,
like off in the distance to see the screen.

1250
01:18:10.310 --> 01:18:12.570
Look at the 17 look at the welterweight it by the way.

1251
01:18:12.571 --> 01:18:16.580
I look at the welterweight division top five good.

1252
01:18:16.581 --> 01:18:20.520
45 and yeah,
it's just,
it's just a murderer's row.
It's so,

1253
01:18:20.640 --> 01:18:23.360
because Johnny Hendricks,
it's a bad beard.

1254
01:18:24.470 --> 01:18:26.870
Johnny Hendricks looks like an accountant.
He's one of the best to be Atlanta.

1255
01:18:26.871 --> 01:18:30.440
His beard,
he did.
If he showed up and he was like,
I'm your accountant,

1256
01:18:30.500 --> 01:18:33.230
I'd be like,
you look like a stocky accountant.
Cool.
Meanwhile,

1257
01:18:33.231 --> 01:18:36.750
he's one of the baddest guys.
What do you call this part of the face that's,

1258
01:18:36.820 --> 01:18:40.260
that's caused the,
it's called the bullseye for me.
When I kill people.
Oh

1259
01:18:42.510 --> 01:18:47.390
yeah.
Joe's got muscles.
He muscle muscles.
His muscles are muscles,

1260
01:18:47.900 --> 01:18:51.260
but kind of intense.
Joe Is,
he's so intense.
I'm good.
His mouth.

1261
01:18:51.790 --> 01:18:52.581
Tell you what though.

1262
01:18:52.581 --> 01:18:57.581
Best hype man in the game you had break down this call right now as far as the,

1263
01:18:57.731 --> 01:19:00.740
as a sports commentator.
One of the best ever.

1264
01:19:01.190 --> 01:19:05.570
As far as how much he knows his knowledge.
Yeah,
and train,
training,

1265
01:19:05.571 --> 01:19:09.980
knowledge me fights.
He's been in the game getting,
Joe's a very smart guy,

1266
01:19:10.010 --> 01:19:13.340
but he's also,
his secret is his intensity over a long period of time.

1267
01:19:13.370 --> 01:19:16.310
He's got the craziest discipline work ethic.
Like he was telling us,

1268
01:19:16.311 --> 01:19:19.430
he went to freaking like Chucky cheese or something with his kid is playing one

1269
01:19:19.431 --> 01:19:23.240
of those pop up games and he realized the high score is 500 so he sat there for

1270
01:19:23.241 --> 01:19:27.800
an hour till we got 500 well,
he goes,
that's an issue.
And he hurt his shoulder.

1271
01:19:27.830 --> 01:19:29.120
He gives good life advice.

1272
01:19:29.210 --> 01:19:31.760
I was like depressed like a month ago and he gave me really good life advice.

1273
01:19:31.790 --> 01:19:34.010
What did he say?
He says,
just look at life as a movie.

1274
01:19:34.040 --> 01:19:37.310
Like you're in a movie and you want someone to watch your movie.

1275
01:19:37.880 --> 01:19:41.340
I love that it's ice.
He said that to me.
That's what I say.
Oh,
I liked that too.

1276
01:19:41.341 --> 01:19:43.850
I'm gonna write that down.
Thank you.
Said that to me once.
He said,
he said,

1277
01:19:43.970 --> 01:19:46.730
you have to act like you're the star of your own work.
That's what he said.
Yeah.

1278
01:19:46.740 --> 01:19:51.260
Yeah.
And it really helped me out.
It's a really Joe.
Hey Bobby.
I just said,

1279
01:19:51.280 --> 01:19:55.580
I said this to him.
You,
you're one of the funniest fucking people ever,

1280
01:19:55.970 --> 01:19:59.510
and you're one of the Er,
you're,
you,
you have greatness in you as a comic.

1281
01:20:00.110 --> 01:20:03.170
And I've said that to you before and I,
you know,

1282
01:20:03.171 --> 01:20:04.490
very few people can do what you do.

1283
01:20:04.490 --> 01:20:06.470
So you should never be depressed about that year.

1284
01:20:06.900 --> 01:20:10.670
You have the ability to be one of the greatest comics periods.

1285
01:20:10.671 --> 01:20:14.160
So I send that to you before and I've said that to you publicly,

1286
01:20:14.161 --> 01:20:16.400
but I said that to you privately and now said,

1287
01:20:16.530 --> 01:20:18.160
so I don't want to hear your bullshit.

1288
01:20:18.620 --> 01:20:21.240
Why are you all you have to do is when you feel depressed,
it start writing.

1289
01:20:22.110 --> 01:20:25.680
You talked about what you're down,
Bobby,
we talk about why you were down.

1290
01:20:25.710 --> 01:20:28.620
Was it just things just like,
just go to a fuck?
No,
I just go through,

1291
01:20:28.650 --> 01:20:32.280
it's usually when people think I'm other people,
then I get really depressed.

1292
01:20:32.730 --> 01:20:34.770
Like Jackie Chan or no,
they'll go,
hey,

1293
01:20:34.771 --> 01:20:37.320
I love you on the hangover and then I'll go,
that's not me.
And they'd go,
yeah,

1294
01:20:37.321 --> 01:20:41.150
you are and all that.
No,
that's not me.
God tried to convince me that I'm him.

1295
01:20:41.460 --> 01:20:42.271
Well,
they'll go,
I love you.

1296
01:20:42.271 --> 01:20:45.570
Only heroes or I love you on Grey's anatomy and stuff.
I go,

1297
01:20:45.571 --> 01:20:50.010
that's a girl and stuff.
But yeah,
I know man.
Oh Jesus Christ.

1298
01:20:50.140 --> 01:20:53.760
You get people think you're somebody else.
No.
Okay.

1299
01:20:53.761 --> 01:20:57.390
Well you don't know what I'm talking about that you have a buddy year at funnier

1300
01:20:57.391 --> 01:20:59.220
than all those people I know.

1301
01:20:59.221 --> 01:21:03.210
But John is awesome and amazing,
but um,

1302
01:21:03.240 --> 01:21:07.190
does he do standup too or no,
he used to.
He does mostly sketch.
Yeah.

1303
01:21:07.280 --> 01:21:10.290
Ken Did on a standup DDI.
We on tour together and stuff.
Oh Wow.

1304
01:21:10.590 --> 01:21:12.930
That must have been a,
who do you think people think you are?
Brian,

1305
01:21:13.020 --> 01:21:16.850
Tom Cruise and Rory Macdonald.
I see.
Anything I'm writing Robert,
Robert,

1306
01:21:16.851 --> 01:21:21.210
Robert and Tom.
Has Anyone,
uh,
Luke Perry?

1307
01:21:21.240 --> 01:21:22.200
I don't want to talk about it right now.

1308
01:21:24.720 --> 01:21:29.220
Do people say that like you're Luke Perry?
It used to be,
I was like,
okay.

1309
01:21:29.250 --> 01:21:31.950
I see bit.
I'm older now,
so

1310
01:21:34.140 --> 01:21:38.040
he's always on me.
I think Luke is about 50 warm look them up.

1311
01:21:38.290 --> 01:21:41.650
I wonder what he looks like.
Everybody's younger than me and they are,
but right.

1312
01:21:41.670 --> 01:21:43.890
Bobby,
how old are you now?
Oh man,
old.

1313
01:21:44.280 --> 01:21:47.050
I'm 48 so roughly 43 dude,

1314
01:21:47.220 --> 01:21:49.730
don't then various Asian races.

1315
01:21:49.930 --> 01:21:52.950
No Asians and black people age so much better than white people.

1316
01:21:52.951 --> 01:21:56.340
Usually in general,
the each so much better.
Thank you.
Yeah.
Well

1317
01:21:58.020 --> 01:22:01.770
we've evolved.
Dammit.
Bobby.
Bobby there.
Luke Perry.

1318
01:22:02.190 --> 01:22:05.280
But look at how soft my skin is.
Tough.
Yeah,
I can see this to text my skin.

1319
01:22:05.540 --> 01:22:08.460
Look outside.
So you don't shave either.
How old is he now?

1320
01:22:09.330 --> 01:22:14.250
48 the same age.
He might look a little older than me.
Okay.

1321
01:22:14.251 --> 01:22:17.370
Brian,
does he hear it now?
Oh,
for sure.
Rather he looks older than you.
They.

1322
01:22:17.490 --> 01:22:21.330
Brian is Brian.
How?
How old is he in that top left picture though?

1323
01:22:21.331 --> 01:22:23.280
Cause if that's 40 at least I looked like,

1324
01:22:23.330 --> 01:22:28.140
can you guys have the same hairline for sure.
Yeah,
I can see it.

1325
01:22:28.560 --> 01:22:33.280
He's smaller than me.
Oh,
right there.
It looks about every bit of 55 you know,

1326
01:22:33.370 --> 01:22:34.171
he's a good looking dude.

1327
01:22:34.171 --> 01:22:36.900
Let's get to compare him to though it's a good comparison on people.

1328
01:22:36.901 --> 01:22:40.520
He should say it a a homeboy.
You understand what I'm saying?
Right.
You're,

1329
01:22:40.890 --> 01:22:43.110
I just want to say that you wanted to thank you so much.
I don't like,
uh,

1330
01:22:43.111 --> 01:22:45.660
compliments,
but thank you so much.
You're that human being.

1331
01:22:45.661 --> 01:22:47.460
I'm a human being and you go through depression.
You're tall,

1332
01:22:47.490 --> 01:22:51.200
you're top ups and downs.
Don't you?
Don't you get depressed?
I don't,
but

1333
01:22:53.190 --> 01:22:57.090
I've never seen Brian than kid count.
No,
I've never been depressed.
You know,

1334
01:22:57.091 --> 01:22:59.910
I hang out with this guy damn near every day.
We've been on the road together.

1335
01:22:59.911 --> 01:23:03.730
We've been through some shit together.
I've never seen them down once.

1336
01:23:03.731 --> 01:23:05.680
Don't bleed.
It drives me nuts.

1337
01:23:05.710 --> 01:23:09.060
You're an anomaly then because I always figured comedians were a lot.
Me Too.

1338
01:23:09.100 --> 01:23:13.240
Saturday boy,
morose 90%.

1339
01:23:15.680 --> 01:23:18.130
I'm going to kill myself to that.
He's a comic,
but he's special.

1340
01:23:18.140 --> 01:23:21.770
Bobby's really special.
Um,
and,
and the thing about cal too,

1341
01:23:21.820 --> 01:23:25.360
I don't know if you have this body,
but he has more than 32.

1342
01:23:25.580 --> 01:23:28.630
Kellen has more energy than me by far.
Yeah.
He's got,
I can't keep up.

1343
01:23:29.760 --> 01:23:33.390
I have to take naps.
I've always had crazy took naps and he was chilling.
Yeah.

1344
01:23:33.940 --> 01:23:36.770
I've always had a crazy amount of high test.
Have you ever get your testosterone,

1345
01:23:36.771 --> 01:23:41.260
which I must be high cause I got just like,
fuck all your hairstyle.

1346
01:23:41.560 --> 01:23:44.670
Well,
let's not get carried away.
He was just telling me that I'm losing,

1347
01:23:44.680 --> 01:23:45.700
let's not get carried away.

1348
01:23:45.790 --> 01:23:49.440
I walked into the studio the day and I thought he's doing corn rows but is here.

1349
01:23:50.930 --> 01:23:55.000
I was like,
oh,
sick kill me and he's like,
no bro.
I'm just losing it man.

1350
01:23:55.001 --> 01:23:56.860
I'm just [inaudible] has cornrows.
I was like,

1351
01:23:56.861 --> 01:23:59.100
all right then we're cool corn rows.

1352
01:23:59.530 --> 01:24:02.050
You and Brian should go on the show naked and afraid.

1353
01:24:03.770 --> 01:24:06.940
I love you and I should do it.
We always talk.

1354
01:24:07.580 --> 01:24:10.030
I got to cuddle you and stuff.
Then I got to carry you.
It's fine.

1355
01:24:10.930 --> 01:24:13.240
Can you hunt Bobby?
I don't know how to do anything.

1356
01:24:13.241 --> 01:24:14.830
That's why I think I'll last though.

1357
01:24:16.300 --> 01:24:18.570
Just on his fat reserves alone.

1358
01:24:20.110 --> 01:24:21.740
Bobby's tougher than he gives himself credit for.

1359
01:24:22.360 --> 01:24:24.940
Where were you born and raised Bobby,
so none of your fucking business man.

1360
01:24:27.560 --> 01:24:30.840
Hey,
go do San Diego,
Bro.
All right.
Oh,

1361
01:24:30.850 --> 01:24:32.400
that's where he did a lot of street fighting.
That's right.

1362
01:24:33.130 --> 01:24:36.180
Your name was powerful for Ross.
Do it for us.

1363
01:24:36.270 --> 01:24:40.300
Sahabi now do they give you those bright green shoes?

1364
01:24:40.510 --> 01:24:43.240
Is that how it works for free?
I don't.
Those are,
I like them.

1365
01:24:43.241 --> 01:24:45.850
If you can wear them that way now,
now,

1366
01:24:46.180 --> 01:24:49.690
now you have to understand this guy is the fair yet.
Ooh,
chair and the,

1367
01:24:49.691 --> 01:24:53.230
now look at him.
He,
this kid has been groomed,

1368
01:24:53.470 --> 01:24:57.660
groomed to be the next GSP is going.
He does,
right?

1369
01:24:58.660 --> 01:25:01.120
You're talking about to,
do you want to talk about a guy who doesn't get nervous?

1370
01:25:01.121 --> 01:25:03.880
Fight Week Roy McDonald.
He doesn't.
He's like a serial killer.

1371
01:25:04.060 --> 01:25:06.560
I thought they should've named him the Canadian psycho kind of.

1372
01:25:06.580 --> 01:25:11.170
He hates that nickname.
What's his nickname now?
The Titan.
The red.
The red.

1373
01:25:11.171 --> 01:25:16.020
The Red Dragon.
The Red Man.
The Red King.
What does that mean?
I like,

1374
01:25:16.080 --> 01:25:19.840
well,
it's like from game of Thrones or something.
He's the red king.
The Red King.

1375
01:25:19.841 --> 01:25:23.350
He's young.
His Shit.
He's been groomed for this exact moment.

1376
01:25:24.370 --> 01:25:27.120
I like his disposition is introverted and sort of,

1377
01:25:27.320 --> 01:25:31.690
you know anyone who knows anyone who knows Rory is,

1378
01:25:31.840 --> 01:25:34.360
he comes out of his shell and he's a funny dude.

1379
01:25:34.390 --> 01:25:36.820
I wish people could see it can really,
he's actually really funny.

1380
01:25:36.821 --> 01:25:40.540
Super Intelligent.
I bet.
Yeah.
He's very funny man.
I bet he's smart as shit.

1381
01:25:40.570 --> 01:25:44.340
Very smart,
but he comes off almost.
He's like that.
He's

1382
01:25:45.880 --> 01:25:50.830
like,
he's an amazing fight.
Phenomenal there.
He's got everything right.
You know,

1383
01:25:51.130 --> 01:25:52.840
very hard.
It can be very tough to beat.

1384
01:25:53.050 --> 01:25:57.010
But a guy who can beat him as the guy like Robbie Lawler's beat them before.

1385
01:25:57.130 --> 01:25:59.260
But Robbie Lawler to just has that pressure man.

1386
01:25:59.510 --> 01:26:02.980
And you're talking about a confidence champion.
Robbie logged coming at,

1387
01:26:03.110 --> 01:26:05.300
look at them,
look how happy he is.
Look at him.

1388
01:26:05.600 --> 01:26:10.490
He's been here since he was 17 he said,
I'm coming.
He was fine.

1389
01:26:10.520 --> 01:26:15.200
That's that champion swagger son.
It's hard to get and when you got it,
bottle it,

1390
01:26:15.230 --> 01:26:18.880
he's a killer,
a murderer or look at him a murderer.

1391
01:26:18.920 --> 01:26:20.540
It was the best one seven year in the world

1392
01:26:22.490 --> 01:26:25.610
with songs coming out too with like you said though,

1393
01:26:25.640 --> 01:26:29.630
you can see the 70 pound belt just being on rotation with these guys.

1394
01:26:29.631 --> 01:26:32.360
They're all,
I mean they're all so fucking good.

1395
01:26:33.080 --> 01:26:35.540
He's just been doing it for so long.
Who couldn't get more relaxed.

1396
01:26:35.580 --> 01:26:36.920
You wouldn't look more relaxed.

1397
01:26:36.921 --> 01:26:39.860
We'll think about how many fights he's had in all the ups and downs.

1398
01:26:39.861 --> 01:26:42.020
Just talking about the guy who was a salty record,
really,

1399
01:26:42.021 --> 01:26:44.630
I think he's 25 and 10 but before he went on this tear,

1400
01:26:44.631 --> 01:26:46.130
he had a salty as recommend.

1401
01:26:46.340 --> 01:26:48.620
There's a time in his career where a lot of people were telling him,
hey man,

1402
01:26:48.621 --> 01:26:52.850
it might be time to move on.
There's a time when he didn't spar for years.

1403
01:26:53.120 --> 01:26:55.580
He would just go in there and train when it's spa.
Why wouldn't he spark?

1404
01:26:55.880 --> 01:26:58.990
Cause he cause the head trauma.
He thinks he's doing too much sparks.

1405
01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:02.540
He took time off and then that was when he was at pat milkshakes camp and then

1406
01:27:02.541 --> 01:27:07.310
he moved.
Well those guys are crazy.
Yes.
That's the old school days.

1407
01:27:07.490 --> 01:27:12.230
You're talking about Tim Silvia,
all those Major Matt,
Matt Hughes,
all those guys.

1408
01:27:12.320 --> 01:27:17.320
So now he goes from there to att where he's just flourishing,

1409
01:27:17.810 --> 01:27:21.710
tearing it up.
That's an amazing facility down there.

1410
01:27:22.640 --> 01:27:24.860
There's stitch herb dean,

1411
01:27:25.160 --> 01:27:29.570
who's that guy right there with the puka shells that probably king mo in his

1412
01:27:29.571 --> 01:27:33.770
corner.
That's phenomenal.
Wrestler,
Bellator fighter.

1413
01:27:33.800 --> 01:27:38.250
Phenomenal.
Phenomenal food here.
Might have some bars in the back.
You died?
Yeah.

1414
01:27:38.260 --> 01:27:40.330
I feel like your energy's dropping a little and you're good.
Yeah.

1415
01:27:40.331 --> 01:27:45.170
You want some coffee or some food or something?
All right.
Do you have a bar?
Well,

1416
01:27:46.370 --> 01:27:50.220
chips,
low blood sugar.
I haven't blown Blippar we're just getting,

1417
01:27:50.630 --> 01:27:53.810
we're just getting into the thick of it.
My man.
This is,
these are the fights.

1418
01:27:53.840 --> 01:27:55.780
These are well off now.

1419
01:27:55.790 --> 01:27:58.720
This is a three round or though or is it a five round five round title.

1420
01:27:58.740 --> 01:28:02.060
Fight him.
Shit.
That's what bikes are five.
We got to five round fights.

1421
01:28:02.061 --> 01:28:05.240
We got 50 minutes of fighting to go.
Why can't they go that long?

1422
01:28:05.480 --> 01:28:08.900
Can't they do endless rounds where like just whoever's standing is loud.

1423
01:28:08.930 --> 01:28:12.740
I think that'd be better if you hate ratings.
Sure.
Yeah,
I'd be dangerous.
It'd be,

1424
01:28:12.741 --> 01:28:14.780
it's too much.
It's insanity.

1425
01:28:14.960 --> 01:28:18.530
You'd have guys like calling and doing weird shit.
I Dunno.

1426
01:28:18.550 --> 01:28:20.430
I don't know if they're stolen would just be in Brazil.

1427
01:28:20.431 --> 01:28:25.160
Did have fights like Hickson.
That's spices,
man.
You can't do that anymore.

1428
01:28:25.260 --> 01:28:29.720
It wouldn't be a sport if you did that.
Oh this,
let me look at Bruce Buffer.

1429
01:28:29.870 --> 01:28:32.540
He's my favorite to watch man.
He gets crumped for these.

1430
01:28:32.720 --> 01:28:34.400
I brought my own Stevia to the studio.

1431
01:28:34.410 --> 01:28:37.900
JML If you notice that I brought my own Stevie get just have a bar there buddy.

1432
01:28:37.901 --> 01:28:42.230
Yeah.
How's that bar doing for you?
What?
I read it,

1433
01:28:42.590 --> 01:28:44.980
it actually doubles as an appetite suppressant.
Really?

1434
01:28:45.570 --> 01:28:49.610
It has to be real stevia extract.
If you get that Stevie at like Ralph's.

1435
01:28:50.400 --> 01:28:51.550
Yeah.
This is that.

1436
01:28:51.770 --> 01:28:56.770
All natural whole foods shenanigans that she is the best.

1437
01:28:57.380 --> 01:29:01.260
We're going to keep her.
Hope you don't mind.
Please don't.
Okay.

1438
01:29:04.360 --> 01:29:04.671
<v 1>Cause I,</v>

1439
01:29:04.671 --> 01:29:07.690
I walked down the street and guys hit on her in front of me because they don't

1440
01:29:07.691 --> 01:29:09.970
think that I'm dating her.
That's fucked up man.
I'm used to it.

1441
01:29:09.971 --> 01:29:10.621
I think you're like,

1442
01:29:10.621 --> 01:29:15.100
you're fricking like assistant system or something like that.
I'm a prostitute.

1443
01:29:15.280 --> 01:29:17.590
No,
no,
no.
Come on.

1444
01:29:17.620 --> 01:29:21.540
Or do you think that she's like a part of some government organization that

1445
01:29:21.541 --> 01:29:24.370
helps retarded walk across the street and stuff like this?

1446
01:29:24.490 --> 01:29:26.930
People think it's make a wish you had something like that.
Can you say no?

1447
01:29:26.940 --> 01:29:30.580
We kind of say like,
dude,
I'm not even lying.
Dudes will just walk up to,

1448
01:29:30.581 --> 01:29:35.230
I'm holding her hand
and she,
they think you're an assistant.
Yeah.

1449
01:29:35.670 --> 01:29:38.080
Sorry.
I Bro.
How do you think that I feel I had horrible,
I bet.

1450
01:29:38.110 --> 01:29:41.260
No wonder you're depressed.
You just made it

1451
01:29:42.910 --> 01:29:46.690
isn't new.
I can just eat rob guacamole.
There's got to be chips and stuff.

1452
01:29:46.750 --> 01:29:51.350
You have chips right next to you.
It's okay if Bri.
Okay,
thanks.

1453
01:29:52.930 --> 01:29:56.320
We can't turn the sound up for this,
right?
No Man doing a show.

1454
01:29:56.500 --> 01:30:00.640
I can't listen to the fights in silence.
Hey Brian.
Ever done one of these before?

1455
01:30:01.760 --> 01:30:05.250
I was set up for the other one.
Just a walkout.

1456
01:30:05.260 --> 01:30:08.590
I wish she was a button I could hit that just slapped you.
Did the K zero

1457
01:30:11.020 --> 01:30:15.160
whoa.
He's a,
he's an underdog in this cause.
The wrestling.
Oh,

1458
01:30:15.370 --> 01:30:19.870
that's what I think in the last fight was close.
Such a good fight.

1459
01:30:21.610 --> 01:30:25.120
How uncommon is that that the champion actually comes in as the underdog?

1460
01:30:25.780 --> 01:30:30.400
It's,
I mean it's pretty rare.
It's pretty rare.
But Rory Macdonald's very rare.

1461
01:30:30.880 --> 01:30:34.080
But the thing is the UFC getting,
it's getting so competitive these,

1462
01:30:34.120 --> 01:30:36.550
it's all about styles and match ups,
you know.

1463
01:30:36.610 --> 01:30:40.150
So let's say Connor winter night when he fights Josie Aldo,

1464
01:30:40.420 --> 01:30:43.600
I bet he is he going to be close if he's an underdog,
you know to me,

1465
01:30:43.930 --> 01:30:48.820
look at these guys staring each other down.
So with the UFC kits,

1466
01:30:48.821 --> 01:30:51.460
if you're the champ you have that.
They're all black.

1467
01:30:51.461 --> 01:30:54.100
So if the champion like black with gold,
I like it.

1468
01:30:54.370 --> 01:30:57.550
But I think for the non champs they have to make it different.

1469
01:30:57.551 --> 01:30:59.110
You can't have white,
both white and black.

1470
01:31:00.540 --> 01:31:05.440
I mean you're looking at your here in the face of,
I mean look at this.
Yeah,

1471
01:31:05.441 --> 01:31:07.630
we're looking Bro.
Oh my God.

1472
01:31:10.470 --> 01:31:11.303
<v 2>No.</v>

1473
01:31:11.540 --> 01:31:14.670
<v 1>Roy is very smart,
very cerebral slash right there dude.</v>

1474
01:31:14.671 --> 01:31:16.590
Super Cerebral fighter stands right there.

1475
01:31:16.610 --> 01:31:20.480
Best Jab at one 70 best jab at one 70 very soon.

1476
01:31:21.010 --> 01:31:23.160
Counter puncher,
Robbie Lawler.

1477
01:31:23.840 --> 01:31:24.673
<v 2>Jesus</v>

1478
01:31:26.420 --> 01:31:30.950
<v 1>a bank.
Is there any way you can smack more into the milestone shit right now?</v>

1479
01:31:31.260 --> 01:31:34.590
Well,
the holding hands.
Oh Shit.
Ooh.

1480
01:31:36.230 --> 01:31:38.780
No one hits harder.
That one 70 then Roy,
that's for sure.

1481
01:31:38.930 --> 01:31:43.930
I mean then Lawler talking about a knockout armor put you to sleep.

1482
01:31:45.070 --> 01:31:49.430
The last time they met,
he knocked him down.
Yeah.
Look,

1483
01:31:49.431 --> 01:31:53.840
I was looking at change and look at our boy standing right in range,
right?
Yeah,

1484
01:31:54.110 --> 01:31:57.410
right in the range of his rhinos.
What he's doing,
man,
I guess he does.

1485
01:31:57.470 --> 01:32:00.800
I'll tell you what's an advantage for if it goes to the ground VR.

1486
01:32:00.880 --> 01:32:04.720
Roy's Jujitsu is very high level.
You can beat a Metamorris,
beat the brakes.

1487
01:32:04.721 --> 01:32:05.140
I've got a guy,

1488
01:32:05.140 --> 01:32:09.010
minimal that I always do it at front of weird front kick that led sort of 45

1489
01:32:09.011 --> 01:32:12.730
degree roundhouse.
What'd you say,
Jimmy?
Under his elbow.
Lawler shorts.

1490
01:32:12.820 --> 01:32:15.280
He's got different shorts on then.
Do you know what?

1491
01:32:15.330 --> 01:32:18.070
I think it's like a different material.
I think it's a light black,

1492
01:32:18.071 --> 01:32:19.600
but looks purple to us.
Done it.

1493
01:32:20.380 --> 01:32:22.810
Who Do you think that's actually a front kick dude,

1494
01:32:22.811 --> 01:32:25.620
he's just holding them off of that,
right?
That his range?
Yeah.

1495
01:32:26.260 --> 01:32:30.880
He has on her arms killer Jab,
a phenomenal jab,
and the knees is those kicks.

1496
01:32:30.900 --> 01:32:34.300
Keep him at range.
How you that jab son.
Educated Jab,

1497
01:32:34.301 --> 01:32:37.210
I call it an educated Jab Brennan.
Oh,
all right.

1498
01:32:38.640 --> 01:32:38.970
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

1499
01:32:38.970 --> 01:32:42.870
<v 1>Yeah.
Royce pouring.
Roy is not known as a knockout artist.
Roy Wins.
It's going to,</v>

1500
01:32:42.871 --> 01:32:47.820
you know,
it's gonna be TKL later in the rounds.
I think
that,

1501
01:32:47.900 --> 01:32:52.290
but the thing about Lawler's a,
he's fricking damn near impossible to knock out,

1502
01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:57.680
especially lately.
And B,
he just hangs around and if he lands one of those shots,

1503
01:32:57.681 --> 01:33:01.390
it's night night.
Well that's quite the Mcdonald's.

1504
01:33:01.490 --> 01:33:04.970
So close to those hands.
Yeah.
They like,

1505
01:33:04.971 --> 01:33:09.530
as soon as he gets in with and range,
he's eaten a nice,
stiff Canadian jazz.

1506
01:33:10.150 --> 01:33:13.030
What are Nice,
but the thing is,

1507
01:33:13.031 --> 01:33:17.090
is Rah Rah Robbie Lawler's take down fence is so damn good.

1508
01:33:17.091 --> 01:33:17.924
Especially she early on.

1509
01:33:18.050 --> 01:33:21.470
So I bet we see Robbie just pick them apart for a little bit where mountain and

1510
01:33:21.471 --> 01:33:24.350
start to come in for a take down.
Right.
By the way,
it's thrown everything so far.

1511
01:33:24.410 --> 01:33:25.430
Robbie throwing a little bit.

1512
01:33:27.080 --> 01:33:27.830
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

1513
01:33:27.830 --> 01:33:31.040
<v 1>this is,
this is Rory Macdonald's time.
I agree.</v>

1514
01:33:31.310 --> 01:33:34.070
I think it's just time in Canada needs a champion.

1515
01:33:34.280 --> 01:33:37.310
Rory McDonald is the most skilled fighter here.
He and Carlos Condit.

1516
01:33:37.340 --> 01:33:40.530
That's going to be the SEC fight.
You.
You know they fought before us.
I do,

1517
01:33:40.850 --> 01:33:43.880
but Ron Donaldson.
Very different fighter now.
Yeah,
but not as high.

1518
01:33:43.881 --> 01:33:47.450
Whispered that.
Bobby.
I liked how you wish you whispered.
I listen more,

1519
01:33:47.451 --> 01:33:50.180
but thank you buddy.
Oh No.
My voice down one.
I'll tell you.

1520
01:33:50.450 --> 01:33:53.000
I'll tell you who doesn't want to be a celebrity.
Oh,

1521
01:33:53.180 --> 01:33:56.330
Roy Mcdonald's and carries just a fighter.
Hates being noticed.

1522
01:33:56.480 --> 01:34:00.680
Hates me in a celebrity.
I love him.
He's a true fighter.
Even more lovable.

1523
01:34:00.681 --> 01:34:04.310
He's a true fighter.
Oh true fighter and love the finer things in life.

1524
01:34:04.340 --> 01:34:08.310
Loves a nice suit.
Nice pair of shoes.
Likes his lady cars.

1525
01:34:08.720 --> 01:34:13.160
Loves a nice pretty young lady.
Quiet killer.
[inaudible] [inaudible]

1526
01:34:13.390 --> 01:34:17.490
stud man.
Superstud I'm very impressed with that kid.
Great Kid.

1527
01:34:17.491 --> 01:34:20.950
And I shouldn't call him a kid.
He's a man.
He's the future of the UFC.

1528
01:34:20.951 --> 01:34:24.710
You know why?
Because he doesn't have a background in wrestling in taekwondo.

1529
01:34:24.711 --> 01:34:26.900
He has a background in martial arts.

1530
01:34:27.080 --> 01:34:30.500
He went into the gym at 12 and start training mixed martial arts.

1531
01:34:30.770 --> 01:34:33.050
That's why he's so good at everything to stay dedicated to it.

1532
01:34:33.080 --> 01:34:35.970
You're talking about a black belt in striking ilcs jabs of black belt.

1533
01:34:35.971 --> 01:34:37.160
So the black round boxing.

1534
01:34:37.310 --> 01:34:41.450
Oh Hey look at Royce add on now you see that?
Yeah,

1535
01:34:41.510 --> 01:34:45.440
he has monster dude.
Well,
well we'll see.
That's the thing.

1536
01:34:45.441 --> 01:34:49.790
So certain guys have exclusive deals like Rhonda has exclusive,
right?

1537
01:34:50.030 --> 01:34:52.460
We'll see a monster on Connor shorts.

1538
01:34:52.610 --> 01:34:57.610
So I think certain guys with the big companies get additional ship cause Roy is

1539
01:34:58.371 --> 01:35:00.440
also an exclusive sponsor with Reebok.

1540
01:35:00.590 --> 01:35:04.100
So he has a different deal than the rest of the guys.
He just signed with them.

1541
01:35:04.101 --> 01:35:05.750
Actually.
I think this is so weird.
Brennan,

1542
01:35:05.760 --> 01:35:08.300
he's holding them off that hand like that.

1543
01:35:08.570 --> 01:35:10.550
I'll tell you what impressed me that yeah,

1544
01:35:10.551 --> 01:35:12.770
of course Roy's Jab and hold them off and all this.

1545
01:35:12.771 --> 01:35:17.420
But that takedown defense by Robert and Jesus and he was in tight Robbie,
freaky,

1546
01:35:17.421 --> 01:35:20.880
that left hand and Robbie stops right hand or that right that,
that,

1547
01:35:20.890 --> 01:35:23.150
that left hand is that you don't know if it's gonna be an uppercut or the

1548
01:35:23.151 --> 01:35:27.200
straight right.
And that he's a south paw then.
Oh yeah,
yeah.

1549
01:35:27.201 --> 01:35:29.110
He's a south Paul Bryan.
Yeah.

1550
01:35:29.180 --> 01:35:31.580
I didn't realize his entire career has been the south wall.
Yeah.

1551
01:35:32.030 --> 01:35:32.960
That's hard to fight,
right?

1552
01:35:32.961 --> 01:35:35.180
Or is it you just adjust and you stay on the outside of that foot.

1553
01:35:36.050 --> 01:35:39.440
It's hard though.
Right?
South Paul's are harder to fight cause there's not,

1554
01:35:39.470 --> 01:35:42.780
there's a lot more traditional fighters and our south poles,
so it's,

1555
01:35:42.781 --> 01:35:46.700
it's very tough,
especially when they're at such a high level.
Like Robbie

1556
01:35:48.420 --> 01:35:52.430
got s swat that the key to south Southview the key of the South Pole,

1557
01:35:52.440 --> 01:35:56.460
you see that left foot,
you want to stay outside Robbie's right foot.
Yup.
And,

1558
01:35:56.480 --> 01:35:59.300
and avoid that left hand come over that Jab.
Right?
No,

1559
01:35:59.330 --> 01:36:03.200
you want to use straight writes straight rights or how he stopped the South Pole

1560
01:36:03.710 --> 01:36:06.440
and a big right.
Kick your head to the outside.
So that's one.

1561
01:36:06.620 --> 01:36:08.270
One Round for Rory for sure.

1562
01:36:08.690 --> 01:36:11.750
And this is going to be frustrating for Robbie because he's gonna be eaten us

1563
01:36:11.751 --> 01:36:15.140
all night.
Yeah.
So he can't sit there and eat these jabs and kicks.
He's got,

1564
01:36:15.480 --> 01:36:20.090
he does not give a flying patoot he can just sit there and pick you apart when

1565
01:36:20.091 --> 01:36:23.060
round round,
round Haitian a shit.
But now Robbie,
right?

1566
01:36:23.061 --> 01:36:24.470
You're talking about conflicting styles.

1567
01:36:24.540 --> 01:36:28.280
Robbie just needs to land one to win this fight.
I hate,
I hated that round.

1568
01:36:28.670 --> 01:36:32.200
Did you?
I hate it.
I loved it.
It was boring.
You know what?

1569
01:36:32.750 --> 01:36:35.530
You're the majority,
everyone thinks it is.
I got that shit was blocked.

1570
01:36:37.430 --> 01:36:42.430
Why this level of fight to be that technical and use your jab set up kicks.

1571
01:36:44.810 --> 01:36:47.650
You're watching.
Now I get positioned where they're stepping,
whether it,

1572
01:36:47.780 --> 01:36:50.730
it's like the Floyd Mayweather Pacquiao fight.
Everyone's a guy.
Hate that fight.

1573
01:36:50.860 --> 01:36:55.130
True fighters like,
oh my God,
that fight was amazing.
They get gas.

1574
01:36:55.430 --> 01:36:59.540
They can see where the circle and let's see,
I can see how [inaudible] around.

1575
01:36:59.541 --> 01:37:04.400
It's like,
all right,
the level of technique,

1576
01:37:04.401 --> 01:37:07.160
the way they're measuring each other.
And and where,

1577
01:37:07.400 --> 01:37:10.340
how they're positioning and stuff and your margin for error with these guys.

1578
01:37:10.620 --> 01:37:14.060
All clinic watching him southpaw worries if we're standing on the outside of

1579
01:37:14.061 --> 01:37:17.750
that Jab and trying to use this,
right.
Oh,
okay.
Yeah.
His foot.

1580
01:37:17.751 --> 01:37:21.080
Watch how his foot is going to be on the outside and watch their feet,
man.
Yeah,

1581
01:37:21.081 --> 01:37:21.800
he's done.
It's a weird,

1582
01:37:21.800 --> 01:37:24.680
you don't want to tell the guy that if he doesn't pay it doesn't work.
What?

1583
01:37:25.700 --> 01:37:27.840
Sorry,
Bro.
Bro,
I'm trying to teach you lessons.

1584
01:37:27.850 --> 01:37:30.990
So when guys call you out with your girl slept around,

1585
01:37:31.450 --> 01:37:33.590
I'm going to take you as my,
like my protege bro.

1586
01:37:33.650 --> 01:37:35.360
So when guys draw him a picture of Brendan,

1587
01:37:35.390 --> 01:37:38.570
so when girls start fricking or when guys start heckling you with your girl,

1588
01:37:38.571 --> 01:37:41.390
you can just walk back and I'll just say this is Brennan shops girlfriend.

1589
01:37:41.391 --> 01:37:42.224
That's what he's saying.

1590
01:37:45.200 --> 01:37:49.100
Rob is going to have to make some changes here,
man,
because what he's doing now,

1591
01:37:49.101 --> 01:37:50.900
staying outside.
I love his movement here.

1592
01:37:50.930 --> 01:37:54.620
I love the footwork of Robbie right now.
Changing it up.
You have to,

1593
01:37:54.650 --> 01:37:57.530
otherwise you get picked apart by the reach of Roy McDonald

1594
01:37:59.600 --> 01:38:02.520
County ran.
I was giving me shit for reach.
I won't shut about reach.
Yup.

1595
01:38:02.670 --> 01:38:06.300
Well we found a guy who's going to use it.
That's right buddy.
I'm sorry friend.

1596
01:38:06.330 --> 01:38:07.163
That's all right pal.

1597
01:38:08.130 --> 01:38:11.220
You know you've got it from him or I spent a lot of time in my job.
Well,

1598
01:38:11.640 --> 01:38:15.150
a lot of time with them on one priority is my Jab Jab man.

1599
01:38:15.151 --> 01:38:18.340
It's just rob is going to have to make some money cause he can't stay outside

1600
01:38:18.341 --> 01:38:20.760
and he's going to have to start.
Risk is amazing.
What a job we'll do.

1601
01:38:20.761 --> 01:38:23.670
Like how it just,
you just can't do much when it keeps it.
That's good.
Good.

1602
01:38:23.671 --> 01:38:26.350
That's what fiber furbies tube or doomed did to Cain.

1603
01:38:26.351 --> 01:38:29.840
Valasquez just kept his giant space kind of view.

1604
01:38:29.880 --> 01:38:33.480
I think Roy has the Best Jab,
you know what I mean?
Yeah.

1605
01:38:33.630 --> 01:38:37.160
The last time I saw job like this was George Saint Pierre.
Yup.
Great.

1606
01:38:37.200 --> 01:38:40.200
Granted they have the exact same coaches that come from the exact same camp.

1607
01:38:41.160 --> 01:38:45.120
I love this.
I love this.
Oh,
don't we don't want start trading.

1608
01:38:45.180 --> 01:38:49.560
Let's get that job back,
son.
Look at these kicks right in the face.

1609
01:38:49.620 --> 01:38:50.670
Just these were reading and say,

1610
01:38:50.730 --> 01:38:54.420
I don't understand how for greasy over doom was that big of an underdog in terms

1611
01:38:54.421 --> 01:38:56.340
of just the betting.
He's always an underdog.

1612
01:38:58.240 --> 01:39:02.260
Two guys in the last five years previous to that sugar cane,
such a piece,

1613
01:39:02.900 --> 01:39:06.950
but I'm saying like they do have gone to war much more than I know and beat
real.

1614
01:39:06.960 --> 01:39:10.380
He,
you know,
he beat the brakes off.
Mark Hunt beat the brakes off.

1615
01:39:10.381 --> 01:39:14.880
Charles Brown beat Roy Nelson.
So,
um,
for doom.

1616
01:39:14.881 --> 01:39:16.590
It's a respect thing.
We were talking about the sun.

1617
01:39:16.591 --> 01:39:18.630
You'll see tonight when I was on there,
I'm Fox.

1618
01:39:18.900 --> 01:39:21.810
The thing is he just doesn't get a lot of respect and it's always an underdog.

1619
01:39:22.170 --> 01:39:24.190
It's like when the hell are the huge market.

1620
01:39:24.870 --> 01:39:27.690
It's crazy to look at how looking at Aurora just keeps,

1621
01:39:27.780 --> 01:39:30.150
he's going to do this all night.
You're not going to get them out of his damn.

1622
01:39:30.151 --> 01:39:32.730
You're not going to log them into a,
it doesn't have an answer right now.

1623
01:39:32.731 --> 01:39:34.860
He doesn't have an answer to what's going on and getting frustrated,

1624
01:39:34.890 --> 01:39:37.460
and I bet you we see later this round,
the third round,

1625
01:39:37.461 --> 01:39:39.810
you start opening up and taking chances and he's going to pay for it.

1626
01:39:40.260 --> 01:39:43.010
Or He's gonna Clip,
Rory,
right?
Well,
yeah,

1627
01:39:44.710 --> 01:39:47.220
Rory,
but you're right,
man.

1628
01:39:47.221 --> 01:39:49.770
If Robbie stance,

1629
01:39:51.240 --> 01:39:53.940
if you have a young kid who wants to get involved in MMA,

1630
01:39:54.090 --> 01:39:56.550
you show them tape on rural McDonald to you ever,

1631
01:39:56.670 --> 01:39:58.310
and then he says he does anything you'd say,

1632
01:39:58.440 --> 01:40:01.650
never get an MMA that's going to say,
or he doesn't eat a lot of punches.

1633
01:40:01.890 --> 01:40:05.750
He's very disciplined.
It's free.
It's also a mindset like it.
He's just,
he's a,

1634
01:40:05.920 --> 01:40:08.820
he's a serial killer.
You just need a,
he's a different animal for sure.

1635
01:40:08.830 --> 01:40:12.120
Different animal
just doesn't get,
his heart rate,

1636
01:40:12.121 --> 01:40:16.050
never raises it seems he's just going to choose does,
but he just stays cool,

1637
01:40:16.080 --> 01:40:18.860
calm,
collected.
That's why it's fine.
I don't want to hedge live in Brennan.

1638
01:40:18.870 --> 01:40:21.450
He's just standing there,
but just measuring shots,
his footwork,

1639
01:40:21.660 --> 01:40:25.530
that's getting them out of the way.
It's this distance control,

1640
01:40:25.590 --> 01:40:30.060
which is everything peripheral,
not,
not worrying so much about slipping punches,

1641
01:40:30.061 --> 01:40:33.690
but rather kind of being out of the way.
He's relying on his feet and his jab.

1642
01:40:35.100 --> 01:40:37.800
He's just big too.
He's big.
Oh,

1643
01:40:37.801 --> 01:40:41.130
well better pay attention.
Now.

1644
01:40:41.131 --> 01:40:45.250
Robbie Lawler is a champion for a reason.
You,
you,
you,

1645
01:40:45.310 --> 01:40:48.360
you get so nervous with Robbie because you can,
you can connect with him.

1646
01:40:48.770 --> 01:40:52.860
Knocked out.
This is the wall.
He opened them up.
Oh Shit.
This is the one.
Come on.

1647
01:40:52.861 --> 01:40:56.890
We're Maria's fan.
That'd be great.
Roy is standing there taking it.
Damn it.

1648
01:40:56.891 --> 01:41:01.360
Look now.
Now look,
you got cut the champions.
Confidence Son.
That's trouble.

1649
01:41:01.660 --> 01:41:05.090
Oh,
good counterpoint.

1650
01:41:05.120 --> 01:41:07.110
You look at the chat,

1651
01:41:09.120 --> 01:41:12.760
they're eating some shots on my God.
Rory for sure.
Get out of the way.

1652
01:41:12.970 --> 01:41:16.300
I told you he was standing in there and within range.
Well Netball.

1653
01:41:16.380 --> 01:41:19.750
Now the champ found a little secret high fennel open in the kitchen as you call

1654
01:41:19.751 --> 01:41:24.330
it.
Kalin.
Yup.
He's in his kitchen kitchen or the UFC fighters.

1655
01:41:24.620 --> 01:41:28.090
She'd get a Tan.
They should get a Tan because when you're pale like that guy,

1656
01:41:28.430 --> 01:41:32.770
you don't look,
you can see the blood morning isn't always translate well though,

1657
01:41:32.920 --> 01:41:36.430
cause I remember Leo Machida not too long ago came in with like an ultra fake

1658
01:41:36.431 --> 01:41:38.380
town and I saw it like it was very odd.
By the way,

1659
01:41:38.381 --> 01:41:41.340
Rory Macdonald's taken some shots right now,
ladies and gentlemen.
Yeah.

1660
01:41:41.350 --> 01:41:44.440
This why it's not going five rounds.
They continue this smile on his face.

1661
01:41:45.580 --> 01:41:48.430
Damn you got,
you got to give a Robbie this route one to one.

1662
01:41:48.431 --> 01:41:50.680
Probably when she say Jamie,
I'll get his face

1663
01:41:51.780 --> 01:41:52.613
<v 3>for sure Robin.</v>

1664
01:41:53.540 --> 01:41:57.290
<v 1>Damn.
The confidence of a champ is trouble when we start to open it up.</v>

1665
01:41:57.410 --> 01:41:59.330
Now he's laying his jab and as long too.

1666
01:42:01.220 --> 01:42:05.800
Oh Man.
Robbie Lawler shit.

1667
01:42:05.801 --> 01:42:09.910
He can take shit man.
He's so damn durable.

1668
01:42:13.580 --> 01:42:18.140
Yeah,
he took bunches from Johnny Hendricks.
I want to apologize.
The big rig.

1669
01:42:18.230 --> 01:42:21.590
I want to apologize.
What's up man?
The fights of the first one was bad,

1670
01:42:21.591 --> 01:42:24.350
but this is a second round was very good.
So I want to apologize.

1671
01:42:24.351 --> 01:42:28.310
You want a session?
He broke it.
He broke out.
He broke his nose there.

1672
01:42:28.820 --> 01:42:32.090
Uh,
it looks like an orb or law.
I wouldn't say his nose.
All right.

1673
01:42:32.150 --> 01:42:35.180
Well it's not good either way.
It's not good.
What's not good?

1674
01:42:35.181 --> 01:42:38.000
As you got the champ being comfortable and he's like,
oh,
hold up.

1675
01:42:38.070 --> 01:42:40.460
Because at first one and you're frustrated,
set round,
you're like,
well,

1676
01:42:40.520 --> 01:42:41.550
so we got one,
two,
one

1677
01:42:43.820 --> 01:42:48.470
motherfucker momentum's a motherfucker and fighting shit.
Dude.

1678
01:42:48.530 --> 01:42:52.280
Roy hasn't been in trouble in a little bit.
Oh no,
he hasn't man.
Oh Man.

1679
01:42:53.390 --> 01:42:58.010
Robbie Lawler is really,
look at,
they look at the counter on this fucker.

1680
01:42:58.460 --> 01:43:02.330
I wasn't sold on Rory before this,
but I really want him to know when no,
right.

1681
01:43:02.960 --> 01:43:06.500
But there's something about him that's just,
I try to be on bias.
We got,
damn it.

1682
01:43:06.501 --> 01:43:11.180
I suck at it till he was good at being unbiased or boy Joe Rogan kind of has to

1683
01:43:11.181 --> 01:43:14.210
be right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Just fucked him up.

1684
01:43:16.890 --> 01:43:20.370
Yeah.
We got one to one.
What?

1685
01:43:20.371 --> 01:43:22.050
A fricking card.

1686
01:43:25.840 --> 01:43:28.130
He broke his order but over the bone or something like that.
Yeah.

1687
01:43:28.150 --> 01:43:32.260
It looks like an orbitals messed up and look at the champ frothing at the mouth.

1688
01:43:32.261 --> 01:43:35.860
Yeah,
that's what you don't want to see.
Okay.
What though?

1689
01:43:37.180 --> 01:43:41.440
We're in round three here.
Ladies and gentlemen.
Step over that fucking

1690
01:43:43.660 --> 01:43:43.931
God.

1691
01:43:43.931 --> 01:43:47.830
Robbie Lawler just keeps his eyes open and just sees everything cause he keeps

1692
01:43:47.831 --> 01:43:51.430
his eyes open.
Yes.
Oh these exchanges are where like,
oh,

1693
01:43:51.500 --> 01:43:54.230
you hold your breath like one shot to the chin.

1694
01:43:54.340 --> 01:43:56.870
Something's going down this route.
So I'm getting,
someone's getting dropped.

1695
01:43:56.871 --> 01:43:59.630
This rounds can be tele changer.
Yeah.
It's just a matter of time.

1696
01:44:00.080 --> 01:44:02.840
I don't like the way Ryan,
is he in the shot?
I don't either.
I think he,

1697
01:44:02.841 --> 01:44:05.810
I feel like he's coming in and getting caught when he comes in.
Well Rob,

1698
01:44:05.811 --> 01:44:08.640
hang for everything he throws.
Robby found his timing.
Yeah.

1699
01:44:08.730 --> 01:44:12.380
Robbie's found some niche on his timing.
And if I'm Rory,

1700
01:44:12.381 --> 01:44:16.030
I'm going to mix it up and shoot for a take down because what he's doing now,

1701
01:44:16.031 --> 01:44:18.050
he's getting starting to get ate up a little bit.

1702
01:44:21.740 --> 01:44:24.230
Damn.
And you can tell what the kicks and there's movement.

1703
01:44:24.231 --> 01:44:29.000
Robbie's just looses as fuck.
Oh.
Oh fuck son.

1704
01:44:29.390 --> 01:44:33.590
How about the Chin on our boiled Rory bread guy.

1705
01:44:33.620 --> 01:44:38.600
Big Donald Red King.
I don't want to look at the elbows.
Where is he is no.
Yeah,

1706
01:44:38.601 --> 01:44:41.660
they're getting close.
He throws his elbows.
His face skin ate up.

1707
01:44:44.970 --> 01:44:49.110
Oh right.
Tell you what,
man,
I don't care how good your Shin is.

1708
01:44:49.111 --> 01:44:52.110
You're not eating too many of those Robbie Lawler left hands.
Very Long.

1709
01:44:52.400 --> 01:44:54.660
Sounds getting drops.
Yeah.
Does

1710
01:44:56.340 --> 01:45:00.540
God dog?
How good is Robbie Lawler so good.
So fucking good.

1711
01:45:01.320 --> 01:45:05.910
He's the champion.
Oh No.
I liked the take down attempt.

1712
01:45:06.720 --> 01:45:11.190
Needs it.
He needs,
oh,
there we go.
Holy take down a fence.
Batman.

1713
01:45:11.280 --> 01:45:13.890
Holy take down the fences,
right?
Holy Shit.

1714
01:45:13.950 --> 01:45:17.400
Talking about a type of martial artist,
he talks about a high level wrestler too,

1715
01:45:17.401 --> 01:45:22.110
and Roy MacDonald.
Holy Shit on his face.
Oh my God,
my sister.

1716
01:45:22.140 --> 01:45:26.070
This is his nose.
His face looks like a Red Matt.

1717
01:45:26.071 --> 01:45:30.170
He looks like the red king right now.
Yeah,
that's an area we have to the attack.

1718
01:45:30.180 --> 01:45:31.080
One of ax kick please.

1719
01:45:33.240 --> 01:45:36.570
I'm telling Robert that not to whatnot don't burn down or what not to do it.

1720
01:45:36.660 --> 01:45:38.400
Nope.
Roy looks like the Red Guy.

1721
01:45:38.430 --> 01:45:41.370
I just watched if I came in from Captain America,
the bad school old guy.

1722
01:45:41.460 --> 01:45:43.110
That's what he looks like.
The Red Skull.

1723
01:45:43.290 --> 01:45:45.840
I think his name should be the red skull.
You can mark it.

1724
01:45:49.340 --> 01:45:50.890
<v 3>That's crazy shit man.</v>

1725
01:45:51.870 --> 01:45:54.360
<v 1>Man.
His face is beat up.
Yeah.</v>

1726
01:45:54.930 --> 01:45:58.350
Telling you something's going down this brown red.
Oh look at these.

1727
01:46:00.150 --> 01:46:04.510
Wow.
Whoa.
Suck it round.
Right.
We're trying to readjust.
Yeah,

1728
01:46:04.770 --> 01:46:08.050
cause the takedowns was nowhere near happening that took it down.
Okay.

1729
01:46:08.500 --> 01:46:12.210
Docker and Robbie Lawler and that's crazy that he couldn't take them down.

1730
01:46:12.390 --> 01:46:15.200
Not even close.
Right Roy,

1731
01:46:15.201 --> 01:46:20.201
you get to add that single deep to super deep and and W I dunno how Robbie got,

1732
01:46:20.750 --> 01:46:24.450
how did Robbie defend that?
What was that?
I didn't even see how he did that.

1733
01:46:25.440 --> 01:46:28.890
Just great.
Take down a fence.
Brown.
I'm not going to break down the wizard 101

1734
01:46:30.390 --> 01:46:33.030
<v 3>oh.
Oh,
okay.</v>

1735
01:46:33.130 --> 01:46:35.450
<v 1>It doesn't matter.
His hands are up.
His hands are protecting himself.</v>

1736
01:46:35.470 --> 01:46:36.520
He's protecting his body.

1737
01:46:36.820 --> 01:46:39.400
These taking those shots on all slow down a little this round.
Right.

1738
01:46:39.730 --> 01:46:41.800
It is the third.
That's the only natural.
It's mid third.

1739
01:46:42.100 --> 01:46:46.380
This fourth round is going to be a barn burner.
Oh,

1740
01:46:46.390 --> 01:46:49.950
Lottie shot.
It doesn't matter with Robbie Lawler.
I just don't see him ever.

1741
01:46:51.030 --> 01:46:51.480
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1742
01:46:51.480 --> 01:46:55.310
<v 4>Getting,
I dunno.
He's talked about it.
Your career.
Resurgence at it.</v>

1743
01:46:55.320 --> 01:47:00.150
He's sick.
It's like he's master.
That's like it clicked.
Yeah,

1744
01:47:00.270 --> 01:47:04.550
yeah,
yeah.
He's a master of enemy.
Yeah.
Which very few are.

1745
01:47:05.700 --> 01:47:08.930
I mean,
the first round I thought robbers had made some serious trouble.

1746
01:47:09.030 --> 01:47:10.520
Nowadays for sure going to win this.

1747
01:47:10.521 --> 01:47:14.630
I just thought I was going to be a clear cut decision.
Oh,
it's a blocking.

1748
01:47:20.830 --> 01:47:24.600
I got to start taking on striking more seriously.
Brennan,
please cash out.

1749
01:47:24.601 --> 01:47:28.060
I don't have this kind of fucking,
I don't have this in and out.
I got to start.

1750
01:47:28.180 --> 01:47:29.350
I know you wouldn't see me out.

1751
01:47:29.351 --> 01:47:32.500
The problem is the other day told me you sparred and you didn't get hit once.

1752
01:47:32.530 --> 01:47:36.190
I think that would be a problem because those that elusive,

1753
01:47:36.191 --> 01:47:37.780
don't get me out of that.
Don't get me wrong.

1754
01:47:37.781 --> 01:47:39.550
I'm sure you're very similar to Floyd Mayweather,

1755
01:47:39.551 --> 01:47:42.880
but you have an inbox and very long.
If you're sparring guy who can't hit,

1756
01:47:42.881 --> 01:47:44.860
you might be time to switch it up.

1757
01:47:44.861 --> 01:47:46.750
But it makes me feel like I'm fighting Mayweather when I'm,

1758
01:47:46.900 --> 01:47:50.080
when I bought somebody who's never boxed before.
Um,
oh,

1759
01:47:50.081 --> 01:47:54.730
first time with your gloves on.
Move around with me.
Oh.
Oh.
That his arms are off.

1760
01:47:54.900 --> 01:47:58.280
Oh,
what?
What that,

1761
01:47:58.660 --> 01:48:02.710
oh,
oh.
Oh Holy

1762
01:48:04.960 --> 01:48:08.890
Robbie.
Lawler's just got rocked here.
He did his every fight.

1763
01:48:09.490 --> 01:48:12.490
Oh my God.
Every fights like round of the year.

1764
01:48:17.150 --> 01:48:18.340
You got a new champion.

1765
01:48:20.990 --> 01:48:25.290
What does,
what the hell this guy,

1766
01:48:25.470 --> 01:48:28.970
car drivers.
Are you kidding me?
He's going to get out of the wrong.

1767
01:48:30.800 --> 01:48:32.110
Oh

1768
01:48:34.680 --> 01:48:39.530
my God.
And still going.
No worries.
Let's go.
Holy Shit.

1769
01:48:39.531 --> 01:48:43.030
You're kidding me.
That was around the house,
which I,
I

1770
01:48:44.610 --> 01:48:49.140
please don't.
Please don't run this month.
Oh,
amazing.
What?
And fight.

1771
01:48:49.210 --> 01:48:52.420
Wrestle grace.
Greatest UFC fight card I've ever seen.
Hands down.

1772
01:48:52.900 --> 01:48:55.050
How about Robbie Lawler still aiming to clam up,

1773
01:48:55.051 --> 01:48:59.070
keep his composure and come back.
It was sort of a delayed response to you.

1774
01:48:59.071 --> 01:49:02.840
I didn't think he'd,
yeah.
Holy Shit.
Sure.

1775
01:49:02.850 --> 01:49:06.660
He's gotten beaten up kind of bad before,
but still one.
Yeah.
Yup.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1776
01:49:06.661 --> 01:49:09.510
Rory Mcdonald is a,
an absolute killer.
He's tired right now.
Look,

1777
01:49:09.511 --> 01:49:11.460
he's breathing heavy.
They're both tired.
Right?

1778
01:49:12.780 --> 01:49:14.280
But he's still got the crazy in his eyes.

1779
01:49:14.281 --> 01:49:17.720
I think Mcdonald's or did it hit behind the air?

1780
01:49:19.020 --> 01:49:22.920
Yeah,
they bought a year.
So that's going to mess up your equilibrium.
Okay.

1781
01:49:23.400 --> 01:49:25.470
That's not bad.
That's not a chin issue.
That's nothing.

1782
01:49:25.471 --> 01:49:29.640
She just hit me right behind you.
So anytime you hit closer to temple,
right?

1783
01:49:29.641 --> 01:49:32.730
Like Tim,
like Paul area or back here,
right behind the ear.

1784
01:49:32.731 --> 01:49:34.710
It's so sensitive so it throws off my equilibrium.

1785
01:49:34.830 --> 01:49:38.030
So you can see I'm a little wobbly.
Oh,
it's not.
It's just,

1786
01:49:38.100 --> 01:49:41.100
it's different than getting hit in the jaw.
It's a completely different look.

1787
01:49:41.250 --> 01:49:44.820
Oh my God.
I'm freaking out.

1788
01:49:45.850 --> 01:49:47.980
I'm freaking the fuck out.
Oh

1789
01:49:53.810 --> 01:49:57.030
<v 3>my God.
Oh.</v>

1790
01:49:58.660 --> 01:50:02.840
<v 1>Oh my God.
He's coming back
here.</v>

1791
01:50:02.860 --> 01:50:05.990
You're talking about the biggest freak.
Oh my God.

1792
01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:10.900
My Lord Robbie still examining covered.
Ron was like,
oh shit.
Oh my God.

1793
01:50:10.990 --> 01:50:13.690
Oh my God.
You're talking about a new champion.
Oh my God.

1794
01:50:15.780 --> 01:50:16.400
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1795
01:50:16.400 --> 01:50:20.800
<v 1>Oh,
McCarthy's McCarthy's going to have to stop this.
Totally.
She's don't.</v>

1796
01:50:20.801 --> 01:50:25.730
Please go two more minutes.
Probably stop calling.
Oh,
here's another shocking.

1797
01:50:26.380 --> 01:50:30.280
Oh my God.
Another one.
Yeah.
He hasn't recovered at all.

1798
01:50:30.550 --> 01:50:34.060
When's the last time you saw a welterweight championship fight?
Is this,

1799
01:50:34.150 --> 01:50:36.610
look at Rory Macdonald.
The beast that he is,

1800
01:50:36.910 --> 01:50:40.120
I mean Hendrickson calories getting Hendricks.
All the twos gap was there.

1801
01:50:40.480 --> 01:50:43.060
This is nothing.
This is,
this is the craziest Shit I've ever seen.

1802
01:50:43.090 --> 01:50:44.830
This might be the whole fight card is the best.

1803
01:50:44.920 --> 01:50:48.270
Some of the best friends I've ever seen ever in UFC history.
Oh my God.

1804
01:50:48.520 --> 01:50:50.560
Rory Macdonald is.
Why is he backing off right now?

1805
01:50:50.561 --> 01:50:53.950
He's just getting his composure.
He's tired.
What helped me?
It's the fourth.

1806
01:50:54.670 --> 01:50:58.810
I don't give a shit.
You know who's winning this fight right now?

1807
01:50:59.770 --> 01:51:04.600
It's fair.
Macdonald.
Oh my God.
I thought he knocked him out.

1808
01:51:05.830 --> 01:51:09.610
No,
you went first to take down.
Oh my God.

1809
01:51:10.180 --> 01:51:13.540
This is just too much,
man,
man.
Boy,

1810
01:51:13.750 --> 01:51:17.710
they were close to stopping it there.
That was inches away from me and stop.

1811
01:51:18.340 --> 01:51:22.990
Come on,
boy.
Come on Roy.
He still looks wildly.
Yeah,
he's not.

1812
01:51:23.930 --> 01:51:26.290
He's plotting forward real Roy.
He's tired too.

1813
01:51:26.291 --> 01:51:28.270
He spent a lot of energy trying to finish them there,

1814
01:51:28.330 --> 01:51:30.970
especially in the third and fourth round.
Rory is really tired.

1815
01:51:31.240 --> 01:51:34.560
They're both really tired.
Brian,
but Rory,
he,

1816
01:51:34.580 --> 01:51:37.000
you know his gas tanks running low because he's tried finishing them,

1817
01:51:37.680 --> 01:51:40.420
so they're both buying time to fill that tank back on up.

1818
01:51:42.700 --> 01:51:47.680
Good Lord does it sometimes another kick.
Where would you say Bobby at?
Sometimes.

1819
01:51:47.681 --> 01:51:52.540
Do you,
does your tech not fill up?
She late.
Yeah,
especially this late,

1820
01:51:52.600 --> 01:51:55.330
but the thing is for guidelines and the Aeon to fight this long,

1821
01:51:55.360 --> 01:51:59.320
I would've told you it's impossible.
Wrestling and everything.

1822
01:51:59.321 --> 01:52:03.070
It's the craziest shit.
Come on.
We'll know.
It's not impossible.
Actually.

1823
01:52:03.071 --> 01:52:07.060
A lot of guys do find out when it's the hardest at your job,

1824
01:52:07.150 --> 01:52:10.090
so a lot of guys can fight this long.
The thing is for Roy,

1825
01:52:10.091 --> 01:52:12.820
when you know you're close to finishing the guy guests,

1826
01:52:12.821 --> 01:52:16.870
you don't even think about gas tank.
You get like this Reyes like crazy energy,

1827
01:52:16.871 --> 01:52:18.490
man.
It's hard.
I don't know where it comes from.

1828
01:52:18.520 --> 01:52:20.260
I would get gassed out just walking into the ring.

1829
01:52:20.270 --> 01:52:23.610
I'm guests that watching this shit that's sort of like psychological at that.

1830
01:52:24.390 --> 01:52:27.490
Yeah.
Oh my God.
Look at her.
Good Ronnie.
Lot of coming back.

1831
01:52:27.550 --> 01:52:30.970
Look at this is a fight.
Every fight.
It's been a great,

1832
01:52:31.490 --> 01:52:36.040
this cards fucking incredible man.
Shit.
This is such a fucking,

1833
01:52:36.230 --> 01:52:39.790
I bet that,
wait until this and think this arena says Conor to walk out.

1834
01:52:39.820 --> 01:52:43.240
We took collar walks up.
I can't take this shit.
Might collapse.

1835
01:52:43.420 --> 01:52:48.080
The feed might just break down.
Goddammit.
Rowers fucking really tired.

1836
01:52:48.130 --> 01:52:49.850
Roy has got less than the gas tank right now,

1837
01:52:53.550 --> 01:52:54.520
man.
You,

1838
01:52:54.550 --> 01:52:57.480
you will not find a fight or more durable than this fucking Robbie Lawler.

1839
01:52:57.540 --> 01:53:01.980
Jesus Christ.
Insane.
Oh,
oh.
Oh look at this.
Why would he do that?

1840
01:53:02.460 --> 01:53:05.550
Because he's a good rep to when the round.
Yeah.
I'll tell you.

1841
01:53:05.551 --> 01:53:09.750
Talk about take down defense.
Good God.
Even this tired,

1842
01:53:09.751 --> 01:53:13.170
he's able to insane fucking scene.

1843
01:53:19.240 --> 01:53:22.870
Rory.
This is a brutal fucking,
and this is insanity.

1844
01:53:24.110 --> 01:53:24.670
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

1845
01:53:24.670 --> 01:53:28.180
<v 1>There's no tougher going this route.
Tougher job.
Who won this round?
Brennan?</v>

1846
01:53:28.990 --> 01:53:33.900
I still think be 100% can you fight if you have aids?
No.

1847
01:53:34.140 --> 01:53:36.720
You can't play any sports.
I need professional sports.

1848
01:53:36.721 --> 01:53:40.180
You can play well with HIV or hepatitis.

1849
01:53:40.181 --> 01:53:43.870
Magic played a little bit with HIV,
Hep C,
well no.

1850
01:53:43.871 --> 01:53:45.760
You get blood tests for every fight you have.
Hep C,

1851
01:53:45.761 --> 01:53:49.660
you're not fighting now if you have anything,
any blood disease,

1852
01:53:49.661 --> 01:53:51.260
you're not fighting.
He's not a dirty word.

1853
01:53:51.270 --> 01:53:54.760
His mouth or do you see us look at Robbie's lip?
It's split all the way up.

1854
01:53:54.850 --> 01:53:58.900
Is it really?
Yes.
Look at his lip like the joker,
like the real life.
For Real.

1855
01:53:58.901 --> 01:54:02.470
He's right.
You gotta.
Oh my God.

1856
01:54:02.471 --> 01:54:04.340
He's still going back to that head kick that wobbled.

1857
01:54:05.380 --> 01:54:10.330
His lip is literally cut all the way up.
Oh my God,
that's not good.

1858
01:54:11.620 --> 01:54:15.520
I just saw a chunk of flesh cuff.
All my both of them.
That's a good swept up.

1859
01:54:16.840 --> 01:54:21.190
I think I am.
I think Dana White's going to be like Oprah.
You get a bonus.

1860
01:54:21.191 --> 01:54:25.900
You get up.
How could he have you picked one of the greatest?

1861
01:54:25.901 --> 01:54:28.250
How can you pick one best,
best,

1862
01:54:28.880 --> 01:54:31.180
best by hands down best UFC I've ever seen.

1863
01:54:32.500 --> 01:54:35.320
What a way to kick it off better than UFC 100 it is

1864
01:54:37.460 --> 01:54:42.160
these two men,
these two gladiators.

1865
01:54:42.490 --> 01:54:47.270
Oh,
Holy Shit.
Look at him staring each other.
Split.

1866
01:54:48.230 --> 01:54:52.430
This is unbelievable.
This is like 300 or something,
man.
Holy Shit.

1867
01:54:52.431 --> 01:54:56.530
And neither do I wanted to back down.
You're talking about fifth round,

1868
01:54:56.620 --> 01:54:59.730
20 minutes exhausted.
You may stop with,

1869
01:55:02.580 --> 01:55:05.950
they'll let you fight with up torn lip.
Let me say I gotta.

1870
01:55:05.951 --> 01:55:09.460
I gotta make a decision.
I got to,
where's my phone?
Holy Shit.

1871
01:55:10.470 --> 01:55:10.910
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

1872
01:55:10.910 --> 01:55:14.850
<v 1>I,
how about neither guy wanted to back down.
Oh my God.
So fucking nuts.</v>

1873
01:55:14.910 --> 01:55:18.000
This is nuts.
Torn Lips.
Not Bleeding as much as Rory face though,

1874
01:55:18.001 --> 01:55:22.620
so I don't think they're going to stop it.
Roy McDonald,
he's a fucking beast.

1875
01:55:24.870 --> 01:55:26.970
Some of the craziest fighting I've ever seen in my life.

1876
01:55:28.650 --> 01:55:32.010
Oh Lord.
Able to take that.

1877
01:55:35.260 --> 01:55:36.093
<v 3>Okay.</v>

1878
01:55:36.960 --> 01:55:41.330
<v 1>His face looks really Pale.
He's fucking tired,
man.
I hate when they're,</v>

1879
01:55:41.570 --> 01:55:45.030
it just worries me.
Look at his,
he's,
he's looking at himself.
God,

1880
01:55:45.440 --> 01:55:48.830
Whoa is his nose is broken.
Look at,
look at that.

1881
01:55:48.960 --> 01:55:51.870
This man,
Jesus.

1882
01:55:54.560 --> 01:55:55.990
Neither Gardner I live out in either.

1883
01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:59.630
I would break and walk to the corner and blood out for blood.

1884
01:55:59.640 --> 01:56:02.580
20 minutes of destroying each other.
Look,
man,

1885
01:56:02.581 --> 01:56:05.610
Robbie Lawler is got the craziest cardio I've ever seen.

1886
01:56:05.611 --> 01:56:10.110
He's just not tired after all that.
He will.
Well,
whatever.
I mean they're both,

1887
01:56:11.270 --> 01:56:14.400
they're both
pretty tired.

1888
01:56:15.960 --> 01:56:18.780
I think their mind is carrying them over at this point.

1889
01:56:19.200 --> 01:56:20.790
You're talking about championship rounds now.

1890
01:56:20.791 --> 01:56:25.170
This is what separates the men from the
boys.

1891
01:56:25.620 --> 01:56:28.080
Can't say women.
Cause there's some bad ass women out there.

1892
01:56:30.010 --> 01:56:34.500
I don't know how you'd score this fight out.
So I'd say I'd say Roy's up.

1893
01:56:36.270 --> 01:56:39.690
God Dude,
it's tough man.
Look at this.

1894
01:56:39.691 --> 01:56:43.110
Whoever wins this round probably gonna win the fight.
Oh yeah,
you're right Brian.

1895
01:56:43.140 --> 01:56:48.090
Cause Roy one the last round last the one.
Well No,
it's Roy up through.

1896
01:56:48.091 --> 01:56:53.040
When those elbows in there,
you think it's three to one?
Is it two to God.

1897
01:56:54.060 --> 01:56:57.210
Oh,
what did he do that for?
You poked in the eye.

1898
01:56:58.440 --> 01:56:59.400
What?

1899
01:57:06.260 --> 01:57:09.120
It looked like.
It dropped him right on.
It's weird.

1900
01:57:09.121 --> 01:57:12.060
Roy just fell down like that directly in the middle of

1901
01:57:14.070 --> 01:57:15.660
the bull's eye that Brian was talking about.

1902
01:57:17.400 --> 01:57:21.780
I looked on holy,
holy mother of God.

1903
01:57:22.680 --> 01:57:26.970
That was the greatest fighting one 70 history.
It's up there.
I have to agree.

1904
01:57:27.930 --> 01:57:30.180
I have not say about that fight.
That was brutal.

1905
01:57:31.120 --> 01:57:33.950
That was a crazy shit I've ever seen.
Why fucking bad ass?

1906
01:57:34.150 --> 01:57:38.490
He was ahead on the scorecards and see that replay.
Let me see the replay.

1907
01:57:38.910 --> 01:57:43.760
I'll tell you what those fans in that arena are getting a treat.

1908
01:57:46.890 --> 01:57:51.200
Edward James Almost again
here does.
Let's see what happened.

1909
01:57:53.500 --> 01:57:54.490
I broke his nose.

1910
01:57:56.060 --> 01:58:00.740
Nose shattered into his brain.
Oh my God.
Yeah,
he's,

1911
01:58:00.980 --> 01:58:05.010
his nose was just so jack.
Oh Wow.

1912
01:58:05.220 --> 01:58:06.480
He just knows.

1913
01:58:07.620 --> 01:58:10.500
I'm guessing the bone probably pierce inward,

1914
01:58:10.990 --> 01:58:15.390
but everyone up he would have died like Roy knew.
Oh,
she's almost all his nose,

1915
01:58:15.570 --> 01:58:18.150
so he just dropped,
dropped.
It was all my God.

1916
01:58:19.620 --> 01:58:24.180
It's brutal dance.
That sucks.
That fight and don't change your career.

1917
01:58:24.790 --> 01:58:29.070
Now your nose.
What changing career at all at all?
No,
no.

1918
01:58:29.970 --> 01:58:33.820
Relax on the dramatic comments
at

1919
01:58:36.300 --> 01:58:41.040
his lip.
How about Matt Brown?
Number one.
Most knockouts in welterweight.

1920
01:58:42.040 --> 01:58:45.070
Wow.
Look at Anthony Johnson.
Fight that light heavyweight.

1921
01:58:45.071 --> 01:58:48.490
Now number six so that his lip,
he doesn't give a fuck.
Hell No.

1922
01:58:48.491 --> 01:58:51.810
He's the world champion champion of the world.
He he game feels lip.

1923
01:58:51.950 --> 01:58:56.590
Don't feel any of that.
After you have smooth 15 minutes after,

1924
01:58:56.650 --> 01:58:59.050
what do they do?
A drawing and rushing to the hospital right now?
Yes.

1925
01:58:59.830 --> 01:59:02.980
Dana's tell them right now.
He said he seen one of the greatest fighter.

1926
01:59:03.010 --> 01:59:06.580
I've seen.
Everything's all right.
You know you're getting a nice bonus check son.

1927
01:59:07.870 --> 01:59:09.730
I think they get a PR portion of the paper.

1928
01:59:09.731 --> 01:59:13.810
You so these boys about to get paid because this is Robbie Lawler is just

1929
01:59:13.840 --> 01:59:16.480
fucking incredible.
Look at his lip.

1930
01:59:17.800 --> 01:59:21.130
UFC fangirl available or it's going to be feel good when you have to stitch that

1931
01:59:21.131 --> 01:59:25.270
lip up,
right?
When your champions can feel great,
man.
You don't give a shit Brian.

1932
01:59:27.230 --> 01:59:27.920
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1933
01:59:27.920 --> 01:59:30.530
<v 1>What a fricking fight.
What a real champion.</v>

1934
01:59:30.900 --> 01:59:35.030
What are real champion and I don't want to see Johnny Hendricks for the third.

1935
01:59:35.090 --> 01:59:39.830
I mean the last fight was super close.
Jesus,

1936
01:59:39.831 --> 01:59:43.010
Karen Woodley's third Whitley scurred.

1937
01:59:43.910 --> 01:59:48.140
I Dunno what they do there.
Let's hear this.

1938
01:59:51.170 --> 01:59:52.003
Hands down

1939
01:59:55.280 --> 01:59:56.113
<v 2>ever.</v>

1940
01:59:59.050 --> 02:00:00.700
<v 1>He's the legend status now son.</v>

1941
02:00:04.010 --> 02:00:05.090
We get the meat head in the back.

1942
02:00:17.530 --> 02:00:18.363
Two

1943
02:00:29.940 --> 02:00:30.773
<v 2>do.</v>

1944
02:00:34.400 --> 02:00:38.470
<v 1>Damn his lip is.
What a great scar though.
How'd you get that scar?
Oh,</v>

1945
02:00:38.990 --> 02:00:42.530
greatest fight.
Welterweight history.
Small price to pay.

1946
02:00:44.980 --> 02:00:46.460
Boom.
That's it.

1947
02:00:48.380 --> 02:00:49.213
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1948
02:01:00.020 --> 02:01:04.790
<v 1>Oh Geez.
Extract is no,
I'd love hopefully aid they interview Rory.</v>

1949
02:01:06.380 --> 02:01:09.230
Hopefully they do.
He's not a man of many words,
but hopefully they do.

1950
02:01:12.300 --> 02:01:13.133
<v 2>Well.</v>

1951
02:01:16.140 --> 02:01:19.840
<v 1>Damn.
I want to see a third between them for sure.
Over.</v>

1952
02:01:19.841 --> 02:01:23.460
I would love to see a rematch.
That's a good point.
He said that that's yours.

1953
02:01:23.490 --> 02:01:27.680
That's yours or fruition.
That's just wasn't one punch my life.

1954
02:01:29.190 --> 02:01:32.040
All these camps.
Yeah.
You want to punch like that practice.

1955
02:01:32.100 --> 02:01:35.160
We'll talk to you in 20 years.
He's been fighting for how many years now?

1956
02:01:35.640 --> 02:01:40.100
Literally.
Maybe 15 or men like,
like that's a guy mastered this game.

1957
02:01:40.100 --> 02:01:43.150
<v 0>He's a master.
He's a black belt and he's a match loads.</v>

1958
02:01:44.120 --> 02:01:48.230
Cm punk.
God,
I'd love to see you fight him.
Killing.
I'm not joking either.
Yeah.

1959
02:01:48.410 --> 02:01:50.930
I'm not a fighter as a problem,
so either is he,

1960
02:01:51.130 --> 02:01:53.810
but neither one of you have had a fight,
so why not do it Callin?

1961
02:01:53.900 --> 02:01:58.530
My Ego's too big.
It's hard cause I tried to do something easy.
Brother cheater.

1962
02:01:58.531 --> 02:02:00.890
He was governor of California.
Cheater.

1963
02:02:01.580 --> 02:02:03.680
What do you mean she had her watch cheat on his wife,
right?
Yeah,

1964
02:02:05.020 --> 02:02:08.750
with the Mexican.
With an x in nanny nanny.
Did you see the kid?

1965
02:02:08.751 --> 02:02:13.470
They had beautiful,
I don't care that you got all the Arnold genes

1966
02:02:16.610 --> 02:02:20.850
has the Gavin and he's rich and he's got any swole.
He has all the Arlo.

1967
02:02:20.851 --> 02:02:23.510
He's going to be the next Mr Olympia.
Meanwhile,

1968
02:02:23.511 --> 02:02:27.770
the other kids that he had with seeing a picture of his son is pretty cool.

1969
02:02:29.720 --> 02:02:32.900
What's his name?
Do we know?
Don't know.
Don't care.
Brian

1970
02:02:35.720 --> 02:02:39.800
friend of ours want to see him.
That little snake your,
how about that?

1971
02:02:39.801 --> 02:02:44.660
That's what he's called.
His name.
Delkine girls voice sneaker guys.
Top Baby.

1972
02:02:45.430 --> 02:02:45.860
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1973
02:02:45.860 --> 02:02:47.000
<v 0>Turn this off for a second.</v>

1974
02:02:49.410 --> 02:02:50.243
<v 2>Is it?</v>

1975
02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:58.830
<v 0>I got the call.
I tell you
bro.
I don't know man.</v>

1976
02:02:58.831 --> 02:03:02.850
This is insane.
I've never seen anything that when you're back there,

1977
02:03:02.851 --> 02:03:05.800
do you have the TV on watching these fights running or do you,
do you do that?

1978
02:03:05.890 --> 02:03:08.070
Everyone has the TV.
Why would you want to watch this?
Would it,

1979
02:03:08.250 --> 02:03:11.610
I guess just good to see what's going on and it's good to see that you know,

1980
02:03:11.611 --> 02:03:15.090
sometimes in your mind do you make it a bigger deal than it is,
you know,

1981
02:03:15.390 --> 02:03:19.260
and then when you watch on TV or like,
yeah,
I've done that kind of slaughter,

1982
02:03:19.261 --> 02:03:23.010
this kind of insanity,
that war now that sometimes that motivates you.

1983
02:03:23.520 --> 02:03:26.820
It's the worst.
If you see a guy go out,
they'll get not brutal knockout.

1984
02:03:26.830 --> 02:03:30.300
That can the first round.
Yeah.
That's a striking coach from team Alpha male.

1985
02:03:30.530 --> 02:03:34.410
Chad's going to be able to take down Conner.
Yes,
I think so too.

1986
02:03:34.840 --> 02:03:38.150
Dennis Zebra took him down.
Seavers a kickbox.
Yes.

1987
02:03:38.220 --> 02:03:40.650
Kickboxer this girl knows her shit

1988
02:03:42.270 --> 02:03:46.790
pretty wide too.
That lead leg is in trouble.
He can at least go for a single,

1989
02:03:46.860 --> 02:03:50.210
I taught her that.
He stands why he talks so fast.
We are growing.

1990
02:03:50.220 --> 02:03:52.170
I can barely take it.
I want,

1991
02:03:53.460 --> 02:03:56.660
I want to say it's also Salone and gentleman is a,

1992
02:03:57.340 --> 02:04:00.180
that'd be looked like such a long,
by the way,
Chapman,
this is in there.

1993
02:04:00.250 --> 02:04:03.240
You actually hired trans men.
There's to warm up before the fight.

1994
02:04:03.300 --> 02:04:07.950
Has Steven Seagal had a loss yet?
He's never competed.
No.
I mean like,

1995
02:04:07.951 --> 02:04:11.060
you know how he supports a fighter?
He always win.
Uh,

1996
02:04:11.400 --> 02:04:13.110
Yo know he supported uh,

1997
02:04:13.140 --> 02:04:17.370
Leo Machida when he fought Randy couture cause I warmed up Randy couture for

1998
02:04:17.371 --> 02:04:21.120
that fight and he got kicked in the face.
Hey,
you know what?
No one,

1999
02:04:21.121 --> 02:04:23.610
so that would mean he did support me.
Fuck,
I don't know.

2000
02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:29.850
He's undefeated beat Anderson Silva when it's like fall that he was there.
Right.

2001
02:04:30.640 --> 02:04:34.350
But that was not a true loss.
I feel

2002
02:04:35.940 --> 02:04:38.460
still lost though.
I don't know.

2003
02:04:39.360 --> 02:04:41.190
There's not too many people had led in my corner.
I,

2004
02:04:41.210 --> 02:04:45.210
I would tell Steven Seagal to beat Jon Jones did.
Jon Jones was like,

2005
02:04:45.211 --> 02:04:49.080
get the hell out of him.
He tried coming back celebrate when John Jones.
Yeah.

2006
02:04:49.081 --> 02:04:51.750
And judge was like,
no,
I don't know you man.
Really?

2007
02:04:51.960 --> 02:04:53.760
You're talking about a true champion and Jon Jones,

2008
02:04:53.880 --> 02:04:56.310
he just crawl up to a corner from behind and just be like,
hey,

2009
02:04:57.080 --> 02:04:59.820
we're just trying to take selfies and shit and get involved in the fight game.

2010
02:04:59.970 --> 02:05:03.390
Did you see his video?
Is he his Russia where he put on like,

2011
02:05:03.420 --> 02:05:07.800
these guys attack him?
He puts on like a in front of a cute dog toy.
He's like,

2012
02:05:07.860 --> 02:05:11.980
act like he's clarion.
Oh Shit.
He's a god in the Philippines.
Izzy.

2013
02:05:12.410 --> 02:05:15.990
I grew up knowing only Steven Seagal.
Wow.
What about John Claude Van Damme?

2014
02:05:16.170 --> 02:05:18.150
I'm not as much as Stevens.
That's disappointing.

2015
02:05:18.450 --> 02:05:22.860
You guys need some fighters in a wrangler,
Lee.

2016
02:05:24.650 --> 02:05:27.570
I mean at least John Claude van Damme.
I mean,
yeah.

2017
02:05:27.660 --> 02:05:30.870
Well we'll get you.
Oh,

2018
02:05:33.540 --> 02:05:35.360
look at him.
He was,
his face is like,
holy cow.

2019
02:05:49.400 --> 02:05:50.233
<v 2>Wow.</v>

2020
02:05:54.460 --> 02:05:58.730
<v 0>I can't believe we're just now getting the main event.
What a crazy nine to five.</v>

2021
02:05:59.510 --> 02:06:02.800
If you guys need to go and you're tired.
I get it.
This is it for everyone.

2022
02:06:02.801 --> 02:06:06.040
So for Conor and Chad Mendez right now or are they thinking we need to put on a

2023
02:06:06.041 --> 02:06:09.820
fight like after watching all of those a little bit.
Yeah,
there's a little bit,

2024
02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:11.800
but that's a question.
More pressure on Connor.

2025
02:06:11.830 --> 02:06:15.220
I was going to say a lot of pressure on Connor and gets you to the main event.

2026
02:06:15.550 --> 02:06:19.630
The main event,
this entire fight card is really around Connor.

2027
02:06:19.750 --> 02:06:21.610
The entire Reno's for Connor.

2028
02:06:22.180 --> 02:06:26.210
The UFC is invested all their marbles into Conor got us.

2029
02:06:26.290 --> 02:06:30.220
You got to number one,
you have to win.
Just win baby.
Right?
Well,

2030
02:06:30.221 --> 02:06:34.010
if he just went and Al Davis,
just one big hour,
now we were hyped for the offer.

2031
02:06:34.010 --> 02:06:37.480
So if Connor wins tonight,
especially if he doesn't convince and fashion,

2032
02:06:37.690 --> 02:06:42.640
he's the biggest star of the UFC has ever had bar nuts.
Right?
If he loses,

2033
02:06:42.810 --> 02:06:45.700
we're in trouble.
If he loses word trouble.
But I gotta tell Ya,

2034
02:06:45.760 --> 02:06:48.040
Brogan says night tonight for the UFC.
I mean,

2035
02:06:48.041 --> 02:06:51.190
what I mean as far as just fights that Rod,
that was the craziest shit.

2036
02:06:51.570 --> 02:06:55.420
[inaudible].
Now hear me out here.
As great as this night's been.

2037
02:06:55.600 --> 02:06:58.630
If Connor loses amp or it's not a win for the UFC,

2038
02:06:59.050 --> 02:07:02.970
it's been a phenomenal fight card.
If Connor gets destroyed,
yeah,

2039
02:07:03.940 --> 02:07:07.330
it's not fun right now.
We can talk all that shit and we're all buying into it.

2040
02:07:07.480 --> 02:07:10.730
But then if you get murdered by a guy on no,

2041
02:07:10.950 --> 02:07:13.120
and guys like Kristen,
Leah,
Chris Lee,

2042
02:07:13.121 --> 02:07:14.940
and that's nothing about fighting type quizzes.
Like who's this crazy?

2043
02:07:14.950 --> 02:07:18.910
My Buddy Chris Delea text.
Oh you got Chris Tega had a group text message.
Hey,

2044
02:07:18.911 --> 02:07:23.080
what's this Irish guy all about?
I just said,
I said,
you're not my friend Chris.

2045
02:07:24.460 --> 02:07:27.930
My mom text me.
You see,
she doesn't watch any UFC.
My,

2046
02:07:27.970 --> 02:07:30.910
that's how big of a deal this guy's again,
my mom tech sure of us.

2047
02:07:31.000 --> 02:07:34.810
My mom texts me and said,
you think the Irish guy's going gonna win?
Huh?

2048
02:07:35.100 --> 02:07:37.000
Were talking about fucking superstar.

2049
02:07:39.280 --> 02:07:40.113
<v 3>Awesome.</v>

2050
02:07:42.120 --> 02:07:46.110
<v 0>Um,
yeah,
I mean we,
like I said,</v>

2051
02:07:46.111 --> 02:07:49.680
it's been a great fight card and I ask him,
why is he a big deal?

2052
02:07:49.681 --> 02:07:53.980
Cause he won five of fights.
Well he's,
he's his flair overall person.

2053
02:07:55.290 --> 02:07:58.170
It's a package.
He literally is the greatest face of,

2054
02:07:58.171 --> 02:08:01.590
he's an international superstar when he speaks.
What's your Twitter handle?

2055
02:08:01.950 --> 02:08:06.060
Bobby Lee live when,
when he speaks,

2056
02:08:06.570 --> 02:08:07.840
he taught,
he says,
I'm a,

2057
02:08:07.960 --> 02:08:09.780
and the first round he knocked him out in the first year.

2058
02:08:09.790 --> 02:08:13.980
I've never seen a mouthpiece like this.
And you see you Boxton at Muhammad Ali.

2059
02:08:14.070 --> 02:08:16.960
Granted you gotta realize Muhammad Ali was,
uh,
was uh,
uh,

2060
02:08:17.030 --> 02:08:21.180
Olympian gold medalist boxer,
phenomenal fighter.
So when he talked,
we all see,

2061
02:08:21.181 --> 02:08:23.720
listen,
cholera has five flights and he has a small,

2062
02:08:23.721 --> 02:08:26.490
where I'll lead kind of charisma about him.

2063
02:08:26.690 --> 02:08:29.260
He still has a ways to go to before we call him Muhammad Ali.

2064
02:08:29.290 --> 02:08:32.910
But he's the closest thing to greatness we have right now as far as being the

2065
02:08:32.911 --> 02:08:37.200
complete package.
Would this be his biggest test so far?
Tedman not even close.

2066
02:08:37.201 --> 02:08:41.760
Yeah.
It's like he,
he does employ a phenomenal fighter.
No disrespect.

2067
02:08:41.761 --> 02:08:45.990
He's amazing.
Worldclass right.
One of the top notch guys Chadman is,

2068
02:08:45.991 --> 02:08:49.890
is a fucking monster.
Yeah.
I don't like the fight.
If I'm the UFC,
I don't,

2069
02:08:49.891 --> 02:08:54.150
I don't have him fight Chad Mendez.
Well,
who either fought Frankie someone else?

2070
02:08:54.210 --> 02:08:56.880
Nope.
Definitely not.
Frankie written pretty much the same.

2071
02:08:56.910 --> 02:09:01.530
It would have been the same.
Right?
Frankie Edgar Mendez.
Well,
I see.

2072
02:09:01.590 --> 02:09:03.810
I don't know if,
I don't think Connor would have beat Josie.

2073
02:09:04.200 --> 02:09:07.680
I don't know that Joe's,
at least Josie who had been a standup battle.

2074
02:09:07.920 --> 02:09:09.310
Now we're talking about Chad Mendez.

2075
02:09:09.330 --> 02:09:13.390
Frank Yeager time like two guys mixing it up.
Yeah,
we'll see you man.
Who knows?

2076
02:09:13.720 --> 02:09:16.950
Maybe Connor,
you thinking down he some sick Jitsu we haven't seen.

2077
02:09:17.160 --> 02:09:21.240
Maybe maybe defend it and knocks chat out.
Worst case scenario,

2078
02:09:21.390 --> 02:09:24.600
even if it goes decision and it's kind of controversial,
that's fine.

2079
02:09:24.700 --> 02:09:28.130
We can take that,
but if he gets knocked out,
that's what we don't want her.

2080
02:09:28.140 --> 02:09:30.930
Here we go.
Here we go.
Let's turn this up.
Dj.

2081
02:09:32.250 --> 02:09:34.860
Well chats coming out first,
right?
Or is it kind of coming up first?

2082
02:09:34.980 --> 02:09:36.480
I think Connor's come out first with chance.

2083
02:09:36.481 --> 02:09:39.840
The giant Irish flag in the middle of,

2084
02:09:41.320 --> 02:09:43.320
he has,
he has a,
what's your name?

2085
02:09:46.470 --> 02:09:51.440
Your favorite Barbie.
I love her.
An old Irish songs.
She's singing.

2086
02:09:55.100 --> 02:09:55.933
<v 3>Oh,</v>

2087
02:09:58.180 --> 02:10:00.350
<v 0>she looks every bit of 70 sorry.</v>

2088
02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:05.890
Is this a first for the UFC to the singing?
It's a life thing.
Never seen.
Yeah,

2089
02:10:08.500 --> 02:10:10.250
she looks at,
she has a grizzly pussy.

2090
02:10:11.480 --> 02:10:14.330
She has him in a lot of miracles and she burned the flag and Santa and live

2091
02:10:14.520 --> 02:10:16.190
tests a crayon.
Well,

2092
02:10:16.191 --> 02:10:19.130
she hasn't been on TV and I make it since you bring the flag.
I love her.

2093
02:10:19.131 --> 02:10:23.930
So much power of Conor McGregor got her ass back into the states is amazing.

2094
02:10:24.210 --> 02:10:25.043
Yeah.

2095
02:10:28.920 --> 02:10:32.020
Holy Shit.
What is about to go down as the cool shit I hear?

2096
02:10:32.190 --> 02:10:33.980
She said turn that up.
She can't

2097
02:10:33.980 --> 02:10:34.813
<v 4>hear.</v>

2098
02:10:39.140 --> 02:10:43.470
It's like a boxing title fight now.
The almost stopped production is like,

2099
02:10:43.490 --> 02:10:46.340
I've never seen a production like this.
There's only one.

2100
02:10:47.480 --> 02:10:50.900
There's only one guy in the UFC can do this.
Conor McGregor.

2101
02:10:53.850 --> 02:10:54.180
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

2102
02:10:54.180 --> 02:10:57.810
<v 4>off.
They remix it right now.
Could notorious that'd be sick.</v>

2103
02:10:58.230 --> 02:11:02.580
There's tourists bother.
He goes by notorious.
Oh,
sorry.

2104
02:11:03.360 --> 02:11:07.530
Oh yeah.
Hell yeah.

2105
02:11:07.650 --> 02:11:10.380
You gotta be nervous here.
If you're Conor McGregor,
you gotta be nervous as Shit.

2106
02:11:11.340 --> 02:11:13.950
This is insane,
man.
Look at him.

2107
02:11:18.530 --> 02:11:23.350
Good.
Holy Shit.
I've never seen anything like this.

2108
02:11:23.351 --> 02:11:27.370
I've never seen anything like this color.
Usually.
If a guy is so arrogant,

2109
02:11:27.371 --> 02:11:30.550
it's hard to root for him.
Connor's guy who's arrogant,
but he wins you over.

2110
02:11:30.551 --> 02:11:32.770
You root for him.
I've never seen anything like it.

2111
02:11:35.200 --> 02:11:36.033
<v 3>Look at them.</v>

2112
02:11:37.080 --> 02:11:42.060
<v 4>Wait for this crowd.
Wait until he comes out here.
Here we go,
boys.
Ladies.</v>

2113
02:11:45.670 --> 02:11:49.450
I got goosebumps.
Oh my God.
I got goosebumps.

2114
02:11:50.050 --> 02:11:52.930
This is amazing.
I bet you next idea is youtube

2115
02:11:56.200 --> 02:11:59.320
for real.
It's about focus.
It's superstar.
You too.

2116
02:11:59.670 --> 02:12:01.360
You too tweeted a picture out,

2117
02:12:01.810 --> 02:12:06.130
given thumbs up and had a big picture of Conor on stage in wherever the fuck

2118
02:12:06.131 --> 02:12:07.390
they were.
Oh Wow.

2119
02:12:07.630 --> 02:12:09.970
It doesn't get much bigger than that biggest star we've ever had.

2120
02:12:10.390 --> 02:12:15.250
He went to night by far the biggest.
I'm awful.

2121
02:12:15.280 --> 02:12:19.630
I'm rooting for Ted Mendez.
I get up.
I love Chad.
Chad at,

2122
02:12:19.660 --> 02:12:23.830
for some reason,
Conor has this factor where he's won me over.

2123
02:12:23.831 --> 02:12:26.860
I'm rooting for this guy he was on are on the firing kit podcasts.

2124
02:12:27.010 --> 02:12:30.430
He's the coolest guy.
I went to lunch with them in Venice.
It's,

2125
02:12:30.820 --> 02:12:34.260
he gets the game and he's a true martial artist,

2126
02:12:35.530 --> 02:12:38.520
very for him to win.
I,

2127
02:12:39.520 --> 02:12:41.920
I just picture myself being Chad Mendez,
his mom,

2128
02:12:41.950 --> 02:12:45.360
and then hating him so much because my triadic man,

2129
02:12:45.370 --> 02:12:48.100
they'd better have been shit on their whole history.
Well,

2130
02:12:48.190 --> 02:12:51.950
what named the last hero they've had as far as that athletics.

2131
02:12:55.240 --> 02:12:59.650
He's from England,
from regions.
English,
Irish are also the Irish.
Also.

2132
02:12:59.700 --> 02:13:01.330
Their history has been one.
Yeah.

2133
02:13:01.340 --> 02:13:05.620
Going to a quick history lesson for Connor comes out through huge.

2134
02:13:05.680 --> 02:13:10.660
It's a huge reason.
Yeah.
You have such incredible patriotism.
Yeah.
They,

2135
02:13:10.661 --> 02:13:13.060
I mean they jump on some shit on forever.

2136
02:13:13.330 --> 02:13:16.450
There are more Irish warrior heroes in this country of Irish descent than any

2137
02:13:16.451 --> 02:13:21.220
other nationality.
Fucking rough people,
man.
Rough people.
I'll tell you what,
man.

2138
02:13:22.540 --> 02:13:24.190
You know what?
The only thing I don't like about Connor,

2139
02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:29.220
the Tiger Tattoo on those beautiful abs,
it drives me nuts.
Dammit.

2140
02:13:29.700 --> 02:13:34.140
So goddamn good.
Looks like a Hologram.
It has to look like a tiger.

2141
02:13:34.141 --> 02:13:35.330
If you can get that tattoo,
I,

2142
02:13:35.350 --> 02:13:39.330
it can't look like a real tiger has to look like a tattoo,
like a sailor tattoo.

2143
02:13:40.020 --> 02:13:43.260
I'm rooting for this guy.
Do you know why?
Because my people in his people,

2144
02:13:43.261 --> 02:13:46.440
we built the railroads in this country all the time has did not the Korean.

2145
02:13:46.441 --> 02:13:47.274
So I want you to

2146
02:13:50.420 --> 02:13:53.820
be Irish fans are,
you're getting booed and you're fighting in Vegas.

2147
02:13:53.821 --> 02:13:55.380
Listen to him.
Oh,

2148
02:14:00.180 --> 02:14:01.013
oh,
here we go.

2149
02:14:02.160 --> 02:14:06.450
American as fog.
What?

2150
02:14:06.810 --> 02:14:11.100
Oh Shit.
Who is this zone?
Who is that?
Aaron Lewis.

2151
02:14:11.101 --> 02:14:14.760
A singer from stained was country music now.
Wow.
He's really,

2152
02:14:18.990 --> 02:14:23.820
he's a country singer now.
The guy from stain,
I had no idea,

2153
02:14:24.630 --> 02:14:26.860
dude.
Have you guys ever seen a UFC like this?

2154
02:14:27.160 --> 02:14:32.100
You don't see went to another level like God,
they're just powered up son.

2155
02:14:32.190 --> 02:14:34.800
Everybody's got neck tattoos and tats.
I got to start doing that.

2156
02:14:37.540 --> 02:14:40.770
Unless you get a fight in the kit.
That too.
Okay.
If we reach,

2157
02:14:41.520 --> 02:14:45.810
if we reach ten nine I was going to say 15 minutes.
Let's go 10 million.

2158
02:14:46.020 --> 02:14:49.490
If we reached 10 million downloads in one month.
Yeah,

2159
02:14:50.100 --> 02:14:53.940
we're at 2 million now and we're growing,
so if we reach 10 million,

2160
02:14:54.060 --> 02:14:57.390
you'll get a tattoo.
I make it a tattoo.
No,
no,
no.

2161
02:14:57.430 --> 02:14:59.360
You got to agree to it right now and check on it.
Okay.

2162
02:14:59.430 --> 02:15:03.690
10 million listeners trying to to it.
Holy Fuck.

2163
02:15:04.500 --> 02:15:09.380
You get a master Kim Tattoo.
You get a master Kim tattooed.

2164
02:15:09.390 --> 02:15:11.740
Definitely get her.
If I'd heard the kid tattoo.
Okay.

2165
02:15:11.741 --> 02:15:16.320
There's no question at f and K we get matched enough in Cape Town at 10 million.

2166
02:15:16.350 --> 02:15:20.520
Yup.
Give it up.
I like it,
brother.
This is on tape,
Bro.
It's all right.

2167
02:15:20.521 --> 02:15:24.330
We're building that.
Do I have a show to do,
by the way?
Here we go.
Here we go.

2168
02:15:24.331 --> 02:15:28.440
Here we go,
Bro.
Here we go.
It's comes down to these moments.

2169
02:15:28.441 --> 02:15:32.280
Math 45 okay.
It comes down to these.
Oh,
you're fine.
You're fine.
Yeah.
Yeah,

2170
02:15:32.281 --> 02:15:33.114
for sure.

2171
02:15:36.150 --> 02:15:39.930
All Flagstaff.
There I was flagging I guess phase.

2172
02:15:40.770 --> 02:15:43.950
Careful now.
Careful.
I would say just from walkouts.
Listen,

2173
02:15:44.100 --> 02:15:46.530
no one's more American than I am.
I'm an Americanist.
Fuck.

2174
02:15:46.531 --> 02:15:50.250
I hate isis as much as the next guy.
However,
if we're talking walkouts,

2175
02:15:50.340 --> 02:15:54.540
Conor won this battle.
Sinead O'connor.
I was crunk for,
I had chills.

2176
02:15:54.541 --> 02:15:57.460
I felt like crying.
I'm not from Ireland.
I've never been there.
Yeah.

2177
02:15:57.900 --> 02:16:01.200
That's the effect this guy has on me.
It's crazy.
Did he?
Is He?

2178
02:16:01.201 --> 02:16:05.980
I don't give me money,
dude.
Imani Dick
Tonight,

2179
02:16:07.960 --> 02:16:12.000
honey,
Dick,
man.
I'm Irish.

2180
02:16:12.100 --> 02:16:14.730
Like drink like,
like he's tricking us

2181
02:16:16.920 --> 02:16:21.780
tonight.
I am Irish.
I got a text from Rogan,
said,

2182
02:16:21.781 --> 02:16:24.690
hey listen,
Connor needs a back rub.
I need you to fly to Vegas.

2183
02:16:24.691 --> 02:16:26.850
I would probably go,
I would just probably the only guy in the world,

2184
02:16:27.510 --> 02:16:29.100
I'm here if you need,
if his hands get tired,

2185
02:16:29.150 --> 02:16:31.720
brought a backup just in case I can't go the full six hours.

2186
02:16:31.790 --> 02:16:34.580
I don't understand the [inaudible] behind rubbing your hands are warm.

2187
02:16:34.581 --> 02:16:38.660
Almost sad.
48 year old dying just to touch.
He's jacking off in the corner.
Okay.

2188
02:16:38.690 --> 02:16:43.090
At this,
let's go boys.
This is war,
not war.
I know you hate when I see.
See,

2189
02:16:43.091 --> 02:16:46.030
I hate when you,
right,
but this is,
this is as,
this is real.

2190
02:16:46.031 --> 02:16:49.490
This is pretty goddamn real.
All right.
This is a fight.
No one's dying.
Okay.

2191
02:16:49.570 --> 02:16:54.430
It's not war
to fight,
but for me,

2192
02:16:54.431 --> 02:16:58.930
I just get,
I'm very nervous.
I just want it to live up to the hype.

2193
02:16:59.440 --> 02:17:03.250
What I don't want to have happen is calm and get knocked out early.

2194
02:17:03.251 --> 02:17:07.090
I just want a good flight.
God,
me neither,
man.

2195
02:17:07.120 --> 02:17:11.680
Why fucking experience they,
I mean,

2196
02:17:12.910 --> 02:17:16.960
now Connor's hair looks not as crumped.
What do you mean?

2197
02:17:17.080 --> 02:17:20.980
I just feel like he's,
what do you mean?
Crunk?
I Dunno.

2198
02:17:21.400 --> 02:17:22.600
Do you know what crunk means?
Nope.

2199
02:17:24.640 --> 02:17:27.760
I just thought I wanted him to be a little more slicked up.
A little bit more.

2200
02:17:27.761 --> 02:17:28.594
Better looking.

2201
02:17:29.720 --> 02:17:34.310
<v 0>You're not playing grab ass anymore.
No.
Now,
now here it is.</v>

2202
02:17:34.490 --> 02:17:37.520
Here's all of
these.

2203
02:17:37.521 --> 02:17:41.360
So just when we're on the Joe Rogan experience,

2204
02:17:41.361 --> 02:17:43.400
Brian Kelly and we were taught Joe Stein,
Mount Ibs.

2205
02:17:43.401 --> 02:17:47.750
We didn't know they actually can use ivs.
There's such a backlash of fighters.

2206
02:17:47.930 --> 02:17:49.670
They can use ivs for this one.

2207
02:17:50.340 --> 02:17:54.470
<v 4>Ooh,
look at him talking shit.
Holy Shit.
Holy Shit.</v>

2208
02:17:55.290 --> 02:17:58.800
He walks the walk,
dude.
He,
what did she say?
Join Stan.
He walks the walk.

2209
02:17:58.801 --> 02:18:02.700
Oh my God.
Pushed October,
right?
October.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

2210
02:18:02.701 --> 02:18:05.730
They should just get rid of that altogether.
What type of fucking dangerous,

2211
02:18:05.731 --> 02:18:09.260
not Latin,
not allow Nivea.
I agree.
Look at that.
Reach cal and boy.

2212
02:18:09.330 --> 02:18:12.270
I agree with what,
he's got a huge reach advantage.

2213
02:18:12.570 --> 02:18:16.530
And there are a couple of things to keep in mind here that that I believe I

2214
02:18:16.550 --> 02:18:21.420
might take down defense has is excellent but he's not been working on it the way

2215
02:18:21.421 --> 02:18:23.850
he probably should have because he didn't know he was going to be fighting.

2216
02:18:24.270 --> 02:18:27.690
<v 0>What were you gonna say?
Why would they be opposed to ivs after the weigh in?</v>

2217
02:18:27.720 --> 02:18:31.190
Cause a blood doping.
Yeah,
the plastics in the,
okay.

2218
02:18:31.290 --> 02:18:33.690
Yeah but I think it's more dangerous.
You take IBS away,

2219
02:18:33.691 --> 02:18:35.460
it's more dangerous I'll graders.
Yeah.

2220
02:18:35.461 --> 02:18:39.790
It's like you have to rehydrate quickly guys.
Blood dope and it's not as day.

2221
02:18:39.791 --> 02:18:41.490
It's not,
I don't know.
I don't want to get into it.

2222
02:18:42.060 --> 02:18:44.970
The more important issue is letting them be healthier when they can't wait.

2223
02:18:44.971 --> 02:18:46.620
Cause guys are always going to cut weight.
Correct.
Let's see.

2224
02:18:46.621 --> 02:18:49.380
Blood doping or guys correct not can wait correctly.

2225
02:18:49.381 --> 02:18:51.010
Come knock on your and shitty performance is,

2226
02:18:51.180 --> 02:18:53.340
I'll take my chances and most guys wouldn't blade open.

2227
02:18:53.520 --> 02:18:56.430
You're talking about the exception that blood dope.
Yeah,
for sure.

2228
02:18:56.431 --> 02:19:00.720
Relaxed water bottle.
Where the fuck your name is?
100% relaxed.

2229
02:19:00.960 --> 02:19:04.450
Herb Dean.
Best in the Biz.
Him and McCarthy.

2230
02:19:04.500 --> 02:19:08.250
Just take a read through a poet little Dick without like actually like

2231
02:19:08.251 --> 02:19:13.060
transfusing the blood.
I don't know what you're talking alone.
Urethra,

2232
02:19:13.610 --> 02:19:18.380
your peel.
No,
no,
no.
Like Epo is what you,
what causes you the more,

2233
02:19:18.420 --> 02:19:20.790
more of the production of red blood cells,
right?

2234
02:19:20.970 --> 02:19:24.540
Is there like a synthetic type of like EPO that you could versus trying to

2235
02:19:24.541 --> 02:19:28.270
actually transfuse?
It
actually is.
I'm sure.

2236
02:19:28.910 --> 02:19:32.480
<v 4>Let me just,
I'll call Lance Armstrong up real quick.
I'm sure he knows.</v>

2237
02:19:32.750 --> 02:19:34.340
Do you understand what we're about to watch?

2238
02:19:34.341 --> 02:19:38.720
In some ways the most anticipated fight in UFC history here.
I mean biggest,

2239
02:19:38.810 --> 02:19:40.910
biggest fight ever in the,
in this division.

2240
02:19:41.590 --> 02:19:44.630
He really believed destiny is on his side twice.
So good man.

2241
02:19:44.660 --> 02:19:48.080
Cause he what he says he actually believes that's why we're on board.

2242
02:19:48.440 --> 02:19:51.650
Look at him.
It's like he's fighting in Ireland.

2243
02:19:51.680 --> 02:19:55.400
You know they're going to Dublin next year.
They announced it.
Copeland,

2244
02:19:55.401 --> 02:19:58.520
you don't think he's fucking headline that card.
I,
I'm what?

2245
02:19:58.521 --> 02:20:02.180
Poor souls going to fight him in Dublin?
Nope.

2246
02:20:02.210 --> 02:20:04.640
He's still headline now what is he doing now?
What is this?

2247
02:20:08.240 --> 02:20:13.160
What is he doing?
That tiger tattoo really bothers me.
No,
no.

2248
02:20:13.180 --> 02:20:17.600
Flaws me cause the grass on the sides.
Why would we put grass on the sides?

2249
02:20:19.720 --> 02:20:23.000
What?
Ah,
the grass on the side for really bothers me.

2250
02:20:23.780 --> 02:20:28.010
I loved the tattoo on the chest.
On the arms.
He looks drawn.
He sucked.

2251
02:20:28.011 --> 02:20:31.910
Wake at us.
Look at him.
He's insane.
Oh my God.
Look at them.

2252
02:20:32.570 --> 02:20:35.600
We've never had anyone like this.
How comfortable is this guy in there?

2253
02:20:36.170 --> 02:20:40.580
It's where he belongs.
Brandon,
you now you're dealing with a 1% are here.

2254
02:20:40.640 --> 02:20:45.560
Oh you're talking about the number one
one 45 around the world.

2255
02:20:45.740 --> 02:20:47.660
Yeah.
It's Chad Mendez based.

2256
02:20:48.470 --> 02:20:51.350
Super Nice super beets that way class.

2257
02:20:52.160 --> 02:20:56.910
Oh did you see your I favor and Connor get into it

2258
02:20:58.690 --> 02:20:59.730
on embedded?
Yeah.

2259
02:21:00.140 --> 02:21:04.190
That for the weigh ins co or Connor and your I are walking down the hall and

2260
02:21:04.191 --> 02:21:04.371
you're out.

2261
02:21:04.371 --> 02:21:09.000
He like went to say congratulations and then something happened where like of

2262
02:21:09.010 --> 02:21:11.990
act like he was wrestling him and then your eyes like mess around and Conner

2263
02:21:11.991 --> 02:21:15.890
wasn't messing around and they had to separate the two of them choking at first.

2264
02:21:17.110 --> 02:21:18.110
Look it up,
talking shit.

2265
02:21:18.250 --> 02:21:19.083
<v 5>Right.</v>

2266
02:21:22.760 --> 02:21:27.330
<v 4>Oh my show.
I'll tell you what though.
Chad's never fought a monster.
Look,</v>

2267
02:21:28.270 --> 02:21:30.940
look at him.
It's go time.

2268
02:21:30.941 --> 02:21:35.640
I'm talking shit talking shit.
I've never seen this.
Oh,

2269
02:21:35.641 --> 02:21:39.880
this calibrating.
I mean fighting a beast,
dude.
Holy Shit.
For sure.

2270
02:21:39.881 --> 02:21:44.750
Don't get knocked out in 15 seconds.
Look at him.
Oh Shit.
Holy Shit.

2271
02:21:45.130 --> 02:21:49.860
Amazing.
Oh Shit.
Well,
oh well I'll do that.

2272
02:21:49.900 --> 02:21:54.130
What's the question we all had?
Will you get taken down?
Holy Shit.
We got our,

2273
02:21:54.730 --> 02:21:57.400
well,
okay,
Chad,
isn't it?
He defended one.

2274
02:21:59.300 --> 02:22:03.190
Oh my gosh.
Jesus,
real quick.
Oh,
he got hit.

2275
02:22:03.310 --> 02:22:07.090
The thing about Connor's,
he in his lights,
he does get hit mass.
He does,

2276
02:22:07.120 --> 02:22:08.710
but if you get hit by Chad,
you're not.

2277
02:22:08.711 --> 02:22:12.760
You're not going to stick around very long shit.
Heads Cardio.

2278
02:22:12.850 --> 02:22:16.870
Given that very good slim that he hasn't had a turn can.
That's a good point.

2279
02:22:16.900 --> 02:22:19.990
That's a good point.
I don't know if Chad was training before this.
I'm nervous.

2280
02:22:21.530 --> 02:22:26.480
What happened?
What are you baby Jesus happened.
Oh my God,

2281
02:22:27.150 --> 02:22:31.840
that scared me.
I thought the feed crash is Connor's breaking records.

2282
02:22:31.980 --> 02:22:36.540
Just kicking at him.
I almost had a heart attack.
I almost had a heart attack.

2283
02:22:36.541 --> 02:22:41.340
Jamie,
don't Jesus Christ both the way he's acting.

2284
02:22:41.400 --> 02:22:45.420
What is going on here?
Nice.
Nice,
Nice.
Do you know what Chad can't do?

2285
02:22:45.450 --> 02:22:50.070
Get into this game.
What Chad can't do is get into the corner having fun,

2286
02:22:50.071 --> 02:22:53.580
smiling,
eaten shots.
Look at this.
Oh my God.

2287
02:22:53.670 --> 02:22:57.630
Oh God damn it so much back.
Kicking him.

2288
02:22:58.490 --> 02:22:59.323
Holy Shit.

2289
02:23:02.200 --> 02:23:04.530
Chad looks intimidated,
dude.

2290
02:23:04.560 --> 02:23:07.470
He's dealing with a guy who hits much harder than you understand.

2291
02:23:08.230 --> 02:23:09.750
You don't understand what he's doing

2292
02:23:12.470 --> 02:23:16.080
and take them down.
You're talking about the European champion as a boxer.

2293
02:23:16.081 --> 02:23:20.740
He's a fucking accurate boxer.
I told you,
oh,

2294
02:23:22.600 --> 02:23:27.180
I just got hit.
It doesn't matter dude.
I'm telling you it's going to matter.

2295
02:23:27.181 --> 02:23:30.640
You can't get,
I agree with you.
I agree that I'm nervous.
The Anderson Silva,

2296
02:23:31.000 --> 02:23:34.200
you guys are untouchable.
I'm telling you that this,
can you do that?

2297
02:23:34.230 --> 02:23:38.760
I agree with Chad Mendez.
No,
I know,
but the first of all,
first of all,

2298
02:23:38.761 --> 02:23:42.820
I've never seen anything like this.
If Connor wins this fight did,

2299
02:23:42.830 --> 02:23:45.330
I'm freaking out.
Look at this man.

2300
02:23:45.420 --> 02:23:48.090
You know the pressure on this guy and he's acting like this.

2301
02:23:48.570 --> 02:23:51.870
We've never seen anything in sports like this ever.
Any professional league.

2302
02:23:52.380 --> 02:23:53.960
I'm telling you though,
he keeps getting hit like that.

2303
02:23:53.980 --> 02:23:57.840
He's not going to be funny.
You're talking about a high level wrestler,

2304
02:23:59.340 --> 02:24:01.680
two time.
All American,
two time.
All American.

2305
02:24:03.540 --> 02:24:05.970
I just want a good exchange.
I don't want it to be one sided.

2306
02:24:05.971 --> 02:24:10.000
I don't even care if Connor wins or
what.

2307
02:24:10.130 --> 02:24:13.190
What we can about what you don't want to have happen is this for five rounds
now,

2308
02:24:13.250 --> 02:24:14.850
this magnitude of a fight to work,

2309
02:24:15.060 --> 02:24:18.360
if he's going to take them down for Connor's good again,
back to his feet though.

2310
02:24:18.390 --> 02:24:22.550
No one keeps them down.
Oh Shit.
I might eat a few.

2311
02:24:23.550 --> 02:24:26.520
He's bleeding.
He's never been hit by a guy like Chad Mendez.

2312
02:24:27.780 --> 02:24:32.100
He's bleeding a little bit.
Me Know what you want.
Oh Shit.

2313
02:24:32.190 --> 02:24:36.330
I told you my prediction.
Fake take down to a huge over right Connor out.

2314
02:24:39.990 --> 02:24:42.780
It doesn't look good for Conor though.
This is a very different thing.

2315
02:24:42.781 --> 02:24:47.680
She got really Pale all of a sudden painkiller jumping ship already mad.

2316
02:24:48.090 --> 02:24:52.770
I'm not.
I'm just,
I'm nervous.
I'm nervous.
Oh,
he's,

2317
02:24:52.771 --> 02:24:55.710
he's hitting Chad.
Check and take shots though.
Look at that.

2318
02:24:55.711 --> 02:25:00.340
Body shots boob hotter.
Colton.
Both of them.
Are you

2319
02:25:01.920 --> 02:25:06.000
crazy?
I think they're both eating it.
Oh.

2320
02:25:06.840 --> 02:25:10.050
Oh.
Explosive Chapman as a social explosive.

2321
02:25:10.140 --> 02:25:12.940
I think if it goes to the later rounds though,
it's amazing.
It's,

2322
02:25:14.030 --> 02:25:18.040
there's that fake shot body shot son.
He's fixing his hair.

2323
02:25:18.570 --> 02:25:21.800
I don't want to be crazy fixing his hair.
Oh,

2324
02:25:23.740 --> 02:25:28.000
it looks a little tired.
Nice.
Well if there's any question to,
uh,

2325
02:25:28.180 --> 02:25:30.670
Connor's takedown defense,
it's not great.

2326
02:25:31.430 --> 02:25:34.390
And now he's getting them out in side control.
This is trouble.

2327
02:25:36.370 --> 02:25:40.480
Trouble.
It's just kindness.
Weakness.

2328
02:25:41.740 --> 02:25:44.410
Well,
this is why you don't come and stop in a minute left this way.

2329
02:25:44.411 --> 02:25:46.620
You don't toss some Chad Mendez.
I'm

2330
02:25:49.950 --> 02:25:53.280
Chad.
He trains all year,
right?
Like he's,
that's the question.
No,
I,

2331
02:25:53.410 --> 02:25:54.790
when we talked to your,

2332
02:25:54.791 --> 02:25:58.150
I said the best thing about chat is he can get away from the game and take

2333
02:25:58.151 --> 02:25:59.530
breaks and reset.

2334
02:25:59.680 --> 02:26:02.020
So I don't know if he's taking a break because he wasn't supposed to fight.

2335
02:26:02.021 --> 02:26:04.240
Right.
How exhausted.

2336
02:26:04.310 --> 02:26:07.770
What's more exhausting holding the guy down or being on the ground like this,
uh,

2337
02:26:07.810 --> 02:26:10.720
being on the ground,
100% your heart rate's going like crazy,

2338
02:26:12.690 --> 02:26:15.790
but I read that he benefits from like a shorter camp to chat.

2339
02:26:16.910 --> 02:26:20.090
I'm not getting [inaudible].
I taught a week really?

2340
02:26:20.460 --> 02:26:24.910
Plus the week leading up to it.
They're doing a lot of press and all that.
So,

2341
02:26:26.350 --> 02:26:29.830
but you gotta think how much press confidence,
thinking much.
Press Connor,
dude,

2342
02:26:29.831 --> 02:26:32.080
for these fights.
You're talking about it.
He was on,
fuck.

2343
02:26:32.260 --> 02:26:37.180
He's doing interviews nonstop.
He had an a tortoise come on.
Fox Sports.

2344
02:26:37.780 --> 02:26:41.230
So this is one round of Chad.
This could happen every round man.

2345
02:26:42.730 --> 02:26:43.990
If he keeps taking him down,

2346
02:26:43.991 --> 02:26:48.780
that's going to happen every round looking at this elbow.
Oh,
that's not good.

2347
02:26:49.500 --> 02:26:53.020
Oh Man.
Well it doesn't have this.

2348
02:26:53.050 --> 02:26:57.970
He doesn't have an answer for that wrestling.
I know.
I know.

2349
02:27:01.780 --> 02:27:05.890
Hold on.
Ah,
I don't want to see him lose with all this shit.
Go.

2350
02:27:05.891 --> 02:27:08.120
He had Sinead O'connor fucking singing them out.

2351
02:27:09.090 --> 02:27:14.050
They might have been a bad omen mood.
I feel sick.
I feel sick.

2352
02:27:14.470 --> 02:27:18.430
I love Chad.
So if Chad wins,
I'm not going to set,
I'm just,
I'm just saying,
man,

2353
02:27:18.970 --> 02:27:22.780
you have the whole fucking country behind you had the whole UFC behind you and

2354
02:27:22.781 --> 02:27:25.510
they give you the worst matchup possible off 12 days notice.

2355
02:27:26.020 --> 02:27:27.790
Does that sound like a smart business decision?

2356
02:27:27.810 --> 02:27:29.380
Do you think that was worse for him?
Right.

2357
02:27:29.381 --> 02:27:32.120
In terms of what do you do when you say you're going to wrestle,

2358
02:27:32.140 --> 02:27:36.310
you're going to find a giant fucking killer wrestler on 12 days.
Oh,

2359
02:27:36.311 --> 02:27:38.260
you're supposed to buy more Thai guy real quick.
Hey,

2360
02:27:38.261 --> 02:27:40.480
we have the worst papa possible match for you.
Here you go.

2361
02:27:41.730 --> 02:27:46.130
Could you still want Sinead O'connor singing out?
No pressure cause you to going.

2362
02:27:46.150 --> 02:27:49.990
Did he have to bring in the training part?
No,
it's too late.

2363
02:27:50.140 --> 02:27:54.040
It's too late on 12 days.
You see him point.
All this stuff is fun.

2364
02:27:54.780 --> 02:27:58.960
He shouldn't be doing this.
All this stuff is cool if you will.
As soon as you

2365
02:28:00.590 --> 02:28:03.420
know it's,
he's big.
This is big and I know,
I know.
He's just watching.

2366
02:28:08.020 --> 02:28:12.790
The thing is not going to say no,
he can.
He can.
The thing is can't chat.

2367
02:28:12.791 --> 02:28:17.110
Keep this up for 25 minutes.
Great sprawl.
Grace was,

2368
02:28:17.111 --> 02:28:21.320
she had some Jujitsu there.
He's got his hands down.
Brennan.

2369
02:28:21.680 --> 02:28:24.600
He so much longer though.
These kicks

2370
02:28:26.110 --> 02:28:30.590
chairs can be tough to not go.
Oh,
I don't know what.

2371
02:28:30.620 --> 02:28:33.890
Oh Shit.
He's learning it.
Go now though.
He's letting those shots go.

2372
02:28:39.770 --> 02:28:43.520
Oh God.
Shit dude,
he's wrestling is nonexistent.

2373
02:28:44.660 --> 02:28:48.620
That's exactly what we were worried about.
Every Conor McGregor fan goes,

2374
02:28:49.100 --> 02:28:52.490
yeah,
why am if you give him a wrestlers wrestling good enough.
Well,

2375
02:28:52.760 --> 02:28:56.270
when you're talking about top of the food chain,
what?
Chad Mendez,

2376
02:28:56.300 --> 02:28:59.110
you can't get them off you.
It's going to be tough man.
Yeah,

2377
02:28:59.180 --> 02:29:02.570
and especially as the fight goes on.
Cause like Dennis Seaver,
listen,

2378
02:29:02.571 --> 02:29:04.280
he's not Chad man.
He's not going to hold you down.

2379
02:29:04.640 --> 02:29:06.320
Conor Mcgregor's popped up before.

2380
02:29:06.460 --> 02:29:11.090
You're talking about the Chad fucking Mendez with Elvis for days and as the

2381
02:29:11.091 --> 02:29:14.750
rounds guards can be tough for him to stand up.
So do we get this for 25 minutes?

2382
02:29:14.751 --> 02:29:17.930
Is this what you want on the biggest fight ever?
I don't.
I don't.

2383
02:29:18.580 --> 02:29:21.340
It's frustrating,
man.
I think it was poor and I

2384
02:29:23.080 --> 02:29:26.870
lose ground.
Get grounded down this way.
Hard to deal with that,

2385
02:29:26.871 --> 02:29:29.720
but we got tee shirts,
sales on it.
That's a lot of money,
my man.

2386
02:29:29.900 --> 02:29:32.240
And you're going to tattoo as soon as we get 10 million downloads.

2387
02:29:32.540 --> 02:29:35.010
Now if he were people hate us,
are going to listen to see you get attack.

2388
02:29:35.370 --> 02:29:39.350
If he loses me,
great,
but he's not an American man,

2389
02:29:40.730 --> 02:29:44.900
American,
so I know.
I know.
But what the fuck is wrong with you too,
honey?

2390
02:29:44.901 --> 02:29:49.310
Dictus into this whole thing.
I've been listening.
This is his 20 minutes.
His that

2391
02:29:52.610 --> 02:29:57.500
you can't fake fighting.
You can talk.
He's a way better striker,

2392
02:29:57.501 --> 02:30:01.600
but I've,
I think that Mendez,
the more tested fighter in my opinion.
Yeah.

2393
02:30:01.760 --> 02:30:05.520
Well you're a hundred percent correct.
That's why I,
when I gave him man,

2394
02:30:05.530 --> 02:30:10.220
this 12 day notice,
you've ruined it for me.

2395
02:30:10.340 --> 02:30:13.790
The biggest star ever,
potentially the biggest star ever in UFC history.

2396
02:30:14.000 --> 02:30:18.570
Now the entire world tuned in to watch him win and now you can get,

2397
02:30:18.610 --> 02:30:23.180
is this,
all we can do is enjoy the hold card here,
right?
Let's stand.

2398
02:30:23.181 --> 02:30:25.790
And Mom,
can you stand them up?
No,
you can't Brian,

2399
02:30:25.791 --> 02:30:27.890
because he's landing huge elbows and controlling the fight.

2400
02:30:29.030 --> 02:30:33.890
You can stand them up if you're Conor Mcgregor's fucking Finn.
Yeah,
this,
oh,

2401
02:30:33.891 --> 02:30:37.070
those are good elbows.
He's saying back to the head,

2402
02:30:37.340 --> 02:30:40.040
but I think you all know,

2403
02:30:40.310 --> 02:30:43.610
I think he's complained about one of those hits.
You can do that.

2404
02:30:43.730 --> 02:30:47.300
See how he's covering his mouth so he can't breathe.
First of all,

2405
02:30:47.301 --> 02:30:50.720
you want to talk about a gas tank when you're a wrestler and you're a hundred

2406
02:30:51.050 --> 02:30:52.760
was the hundred and 45 pounds.

2407
02:30:52.790 --> 02:30:55.820
You really don't get tired when your background's wrestling.

2408
02:30:56.930 --> 02:31:00.470
So that factor,
the factor of this is,
is Conor McGregor.

2409
02:31:00.620 --> 02:31:04.820
This is taken away his power,
his gas tank.
So the later the rounds go,

2410
02:31:04.821 --> 02:31:07.580
the worst is if you can't get up in the first and second round,

2411
02:31:07.760 --> 02:31:10.580
you're sure as fuck not getting up in the fourth and fifth where to go.

2412
02:31:10.610 --> 02:31:11.610
I don't know,
Chad Mendez,

2413
02:31:12.680 --> 02:31:16.820
he still like this for the rest of the ground and Oh,
and by the way,

2414
02:31:16.821 --> 02:31:20.490
if you can't stop and take down the first and second,
the third,
fourth,
and fifth,

2415
02:31:20.620 --> 02:31:24.930
the take downs get way easier.
Yeah,
true.
You're right.
God dammit.

2416
02:31:25.110 --> 02:31:28.590
Why did you do that to my boy?
Yeah.

2417
02:31:28.770 --> 02:31:30.760
You still need to boost your sales though,
cal.
I'm sorry.

2418
02:31:31.400 --> 02:31:33.930
The Chapman has is my hot stick to that.

2419
02:31:34.380 --> 02:31:37.590
What is not doing a lot of damage on the ground?
He is.
Look at his fucking face.

2420
02:31:37.591 --> 02:31:42.360
Those elbows are doing work.
And guess what?
This is using all of commerce energy.

2421
02:31:42.720 --> 02:31:44.790
Yeah.
This is what happens.

2422
02:31:44.791 --> 02:31:47.640
You train for a Moyie Thai guy and then they throw you the gnarliest fucking

2423
02:31:47.641 --> 02:31:50.790
match up on 12 days.
Notice.
Dumb.
It was dumb.
Yeah.

2424
02:31:50.791 --> 02:31:53.580
You just ruin your fucking golden boy in my golden boy.

2425
02:31:56.010 --> 02:31:57.000
What if I started crying?

2426
02:31:58.560 --> 02:32:03.060
I feel like crying even though I'm going to win the bet and my prediction.

2427
02:32:03.061 --> 02:32:06.930
I don't want to be right.
It's a okay.
Real quick team Alpha male.

2428
02:32:06.960 --> 02:32:09.370
They get a hold of your neck.
You're in trouble.
This is embarrassing.
We get some,

2429
02:32:09.450 --> 02:32:13.850
oh shit.
He'll hold his neck.
Oh Shit.
Oh,
oh.
He might go.

2430
02:32:14.430 --> 02:32:17.280
Yeah,
there we go.
He's tired now.

2431
02:32:17.940 --> 02:32:22.730
Oh my goodness.
I think China is our,
it's very tight.
Oh,

2432
02:32:22.770 --> 02:32:26.330
back up his friend.
Oh my God.
No.
Sorry.

2433
02:32:27.480 --> 02:32:32.430
There we go.
Back Up.
Chad.
Don't don't call anybody in chats.
Tired chats.
Tired.

2434
02:32:32.550 --> 02:32:37.470
Oh my God.
This is what happens when we take a fun and 12 weekday notice.
Yeah,

2435
02:32:37.720 --> 02:32:42.700
she cards.
Oh Shit.
Dude.
Don't show Chad's exotic.

2436
02:32:43.640 --> 02:32:47.990
He Won.
He Won.
He Won.

2437
02:32:48.960 --> 02:32:50.340
Dude.
I got to get all the short sale

2438
02:32:53.200 --> 02:32:58.080
shit and the second fucking Holy Shit.
Oh my God.
Oh my God.

2439
02:32:59.350 --> 02:33:00.990
Oh my God.
He's

2440
02:33:02.550 --> 02:33:06.820
the biggest star in the UFC has just turn this up.
Turn this off.

2441
02:33:07.770 --> 02:33:11.400
Oh my God.
It's too hard to

2442
02:33:13.350 --> 02:33:17.400
notice.
He's a champion,
Bro.
He's a champion.

2443
02:33:17.430 --> 02:33:21.720
He's a champion in the second fucking Bro.

2444
02:33:21.810 --> 02:33:26.010
But good lesson learned for him,
I think for Connor Kelly.
It's tough on him.

2445
02:33:27.190 --> 02:33:32.190
You wash the Chapman is Aldo fight at the two and what I saw was him standing in

2446
02:33:32.341 --> 02:33:34.740
front of him the whole time and I was like,
no way.
Look at him.
Yeah,

2447
02:33:34.741 --> 02:33:37.490
he does eat shots.
Oh,
he's murdered him.
No,
he's crying.

2448
02:33:39.710 --> 02:33:44.500
Who's,
who's The lady with the nine?
His wife.
Nope.
Dude,
he did it.
He did it.

2449
02:33:44.820 --> 02:33:47.950
That's insane.
He was out too.
He's such a bad ass.

2450
02:33:50.460 --> 02:33:54.630
It's such a bad,
the reason you got to like this guys,
cause he's a real dude.

2451
02:33:55.750 --> 02:33:59.680
Real guy.
Drama.
Let us now look at us.
Look at this.
Let me come over and hug him.

2452
02:34:00.000 --> 02:34:01.990
Watch he's in.
Be grateful to him too.
He's great.

2453
02:34:06.430 --> 02:34:09.190
Greatest UFC.
Calm down.

2454
02:34:11.270 --> 02:34:15.580
No,
he's,
this is why he loved Connor.
I don't want to go.

2455
02:34:15.581 --> 02:34:18.640
He won't shake your hand or just going talk shit after this.
There's respect.

2456
02:34:18.960 --> 02:34:19.880
That's the sports

2457
02:34:24.890 --> 02:34:27.310
dude he taught himself to be.

2458
02:34:28.040 --> 02:34:31.300
That's your biggest champion of all time.
Hands.
Right?
Well,
he's an intern.

2459
02:34:31.301 --> 02:34:35.740
Champions.
He stands to be the Lord my Lord.

2460
02:34:35.790 --> 02:34:38.320
How the UFC is breathing a sigh of relief

2461
02:34:40.220 --> 02:34:42.750
to look at this and it gave him a new kit and gold king.
Yeah,

2462
02:34:42.751 --> 02:34:46.340
he gave him the gold kit right away.
Look at Brendan.
Look at,
look at,
look at.

2463
02:34:46.510 --> 02:34:49.300
Look at no place.
Spot out of it.
Who that looked like?
It hurt his neck.

2464
02:34:49.720 --> 02:34:54.190
I feel like that's where that,
that's what caused them to cast a fighter.

2465
02:34:54.640 --> 02:34:58.570
My Lord.
Catch him with these shots.
Tell you what,
I'll never doubt Connor again.

2466
02:34:58.571 --> 02:35:02.020
Ever in my life.
Jose Aldo has gotta be worried.

2467
02:35:02.590 --> 02:35:04.630
Oh he hit cause he's the hardest here.

2468
02:35:04.631 --> 02:35:07.450
That one 45 told you he's the hardest hit are period.

2469
02:35:09.160 --> 02:35:11.500
Different game puts guys sleep dude,

2470
02:35:11.680 --> 02:35:15.490
you can't deal with those kinds of punches.
Sure as fuck can't sit there and eat.

2471
02:35:16.440 --> 02:35:17.950
And I saw that he just ate him.

2472
02:35:18.400 --> 02:35:23.400
If he got up and just called my Lord my Lord the whole 12 days,

2473
02:35:23.910 --> 02:35:24.743
notice

2474
02:35:27.090 --> 02:35:30.630
if it had gone past three that Connor would have won anyway.
He's just gone.

2475
02:35:31.990 --> 02:35:36.760
Oh my God.
Insane.
Best UFC fight card ever.

2476
02:35:36.940 --> 02:35:39.410
Connor.
We're not worthy.

2477
02:35:41.070 --> 02:35:43.990
I can't take the money for this year and I'm going to give you the money.

2478
02:35:46.030 --> 02:35:49.480
I'm going to give you all the money when we are releasing turbo shirts.

2479
02:35:49.810 --> 02:35:53.950
How crazy.
Turn off what from asa?
Akira.
Yes.

2480
02:35:54.000 --> 02:35:58.690
Well she's a friend of ours.
I'd like her to be friend of mine.

2481
02:36:02.290 --> 02:36:06.730
She's been on the show.
She's great.
Not Turbo sled.
Uh,
Callen started,

2482
02:36:06.731 --> 02:36:10.690
we started talking about the show and then people went turbo slut shirt.

2483
02:36:10.691 --> 02:36:12.970
So we were making turbines,
which she says,
mom,

2484
02:36:16.560 --> 02:36:18.160
I might have just gone honey.
Dick too.

2485
02:36:18.161 --> 02:36:21.000
Then I'm telling you is if his mom called her honey diction.

2486
02:36:22.390 --> 02:36:25.540
How overwhelming for Connor.
I'll tell you what.
This motherfucker so good.

2487
02:36:25.541 --> 02:36:29.260
I might buy a Reebok kick Connor shirt and I hate those because they can I be

2488
02:36:29.261 --> 02:36:32.350
asking Brendan,
we're team Connor.
Give it up.
Come on Bro.

2489
02:36:33.180 --> 02:36:34.840
Gimme gimme my fucking mind.

2490
02:36:36.160 --> 02:36:38.740
You even get the shrivel slit sales is the craziest shit.

2491
02:36:40.690 --> 02:36:41.680
<v 2>What's he going to say?</v>

2492
02:36:49.240 --> 02:36:50.440
<v 4>The entire nation,</v>

2493
02:37:01.620 --> 02:37:02.453
<v 2>but is it park?</v>

2494
02:37:05.370 --> 02:37:06.690
Wherever you want to sip on me and follow me.

2495
02:37:11.470 --> 02:37:12.260
Someone's mind.

2496
02:37:12.260 --> 02:37:16.820
Don joined the middle of it is so much media to tell the child around the world

2497
02:37:16.821 --> 02:37:20.560
twice and two morning guys.
It was all day.

2498
02:37:22.220 --> 02:37:23.053
It was so many.

2499
02:37:23.600 --> 02:37:27.370
<v 4>So miss.
Too much man did they did too much with them?</v>

2500

I'm like emotionally in me too.
Me Too.</v>

2502
02:37:37.701 --> 02:37:42.170
I've never been emotionally invested in the fight of a guy who,
God,

2503
02:37:42.260 --> 02:37:46.050
it's like we got so that's his dad and mom right there.
Yeah,

2504
02:37:46.490 --> 02:37:49.330
this is mark not back and look in different stuff.
Right?

2505
02:37:49.400 --> 02:37:51.840
For an older lady who's with me.
What was that?

2506
02:37:54.580 --> 02:37:57.740
Pop suited up?
Pops is pretty hot too.

2507
02:37:58.090 --> 02:38:02.290
<v 2>Protect from this style of opponent.
God,
I've been gifted a title shot,</v>

2508
02:38:05.400 --> 02:38:08.790
Gunnar Nelson.
It was supposed to be protected from,

2509
02:38:09.220 --> 02:38:14.020
<v 4>oh he's,
it's true.
It's true.
He proved me wrong.</v>

2510
02:38:14.620 --> 02:38:19.060
Prove me wrong.
I'll eat my words.
I come in here.
There's my favorite fighter.

2511
02:38:19.450 --> 02:38:20.283
Hands Down

2512
02:38:22.250 --> 02:38:25.720
<v 2>my family.
I don't know anyone else to come up with me cause we want to tell you.</v>

2513
02:38:25.730 --> 02:38:29.540
Tell you Sarah people.
Since day one I have here with me now.

2514
02:38:29.950 --> 02:38:31.480
<v 4>Can you think auto feels about this?</v>

2515
02:38:31.920 --> 02:38:36.520
Watching all the went to toe to toe with Chad,
right?

2516
02:38:36.521 --> 02:38:41.180
Grantees chat on a full camp.
All the went toe to toe in a concert.
Cry,

2517
02:38:41.510 --> 02:38:45.250
right?
I'm emotional.
Like I have a lump muffly start crying.
I should.

2518
02:38:45.430 --> 02:38:49.480
That was a fight after the year,
right?
With Chad and part two,

2519
02:38:49.481 --> 02:38:53.530
part two in Brazil to this guy did it all its greatness.

2520
02:38:53.790 --> 02:38:57.160
Great fucking witnessing greatness.
Pure greatness.
This is why I want him to win.

2521
02:38:58.580 --> 02:39:02.820
<v 2>You too.
Don't get me wrong,</v>

2522
02:39:04.220 --> 02:39:06.250
but I can go off fucking day.

2523
02:39:09.250 --> 02:39:13.840
<v 4>Oh fucking day.
I swear to God I can go like Joe got a little emotional there.</v>

2524
02:39:13.850 --> 02:39:14.683
Who wouldn't?

2525
02:39:19.960 --> 02:39:23.500
<v 2>Nobody can take that laptop show is a symbol as I everyone breaks</v>

2526
02:39:30.450 --> 02:39:35.280
biggest fight ever.
Ever.
Give me your thoughts on that.

2527
02:39:35.670 --> 02:39:37.360
In my opinion,
the day

2528
02:39:40.200 --> 02:39:41.610
leading up to this point,
I heard that.

2529
02:39:42.540 --> 02:39:46.320
<v 4>What'd I tell you can come in in this fight?
I heard Mcgregor's knee is fucked.</v>

2530
02:39:46.321 --> 02:39:48.180
I didn't want to say anything cause I want to be a spoiler.

2531
02:39:48.360 --> 02:39:52.490
I heard his knees Jack where he should have pulled out the fight but he hates

2532
02:39:52.491 --> 02:39:56.760
the day will come.
But he stayed and plot you mean like ligament ligaments,
MCL.

2533
02:39:58.300 --> 02:39:59.550
Hrdy has a torn MCL.

2534
02:39:59.670 --> 02:40:03.200
I already asked to have surgery right after this and that's how bad his dude's

2535
02:40:03.300 --> 02:40:07.530
still comes to fight.
I wouldn't want it.
That's what a little Birdie told me.

2536
02:40:07.531 --> 02:40:09.180
I didn't,
I don't know if that's official.

2537
02:40:09.210 --> 02:40:12.690
So that's why I was picking chat cause I figured if he's hurt,
wrestler trouble.

2538
02:40:12.840 --> 02:40:14.010
Jesus guys,
thanks for

2539
02:40:14.010 --> 02:40:14.843
<v 1>having me.</v>

2540
02:40:15.140 --> 02:40:17.270
<v 2>Okay,
you were off.</v>

2541
02:40:17.820 --> 02:40:21.560
It was your girl in Deborah.
For anyone

2542
02:40:23.210 --> 02:40:27.470
especially
tough for Chad.
Man.
Poor Dude.

2543
02:40:28.180 --> 02:40:31.250
What if anything was surprising to you?
I mean,

2544
02:40:31.750 --> 02:40:34.840
first off I want to take on or for anyone except two weeks.
I mean,

2545
02:40:35.290 --> 02:40:37.030
he was training for all though that entire time.

2546
02:40:37.060 --> 02:40:40.060
I mean that's a completely match up,
completely different batch of forum.

2547
02:40:40.061 --> 02:40:42.490
And I'm going to guys talk,
I mean hands down,

2548
02:40:42.940 --> 02:40:45.580
the guy's got the talk to back it up and uh,

2549
02:40:45.720 --> 02:40:50.590
you know what's awesome is these guys,
these Irish guys or you guys are crazy.

2550
02:40:51.710 --> 02:40:56.190
I love it mean I wish we had so much support like this with everyone here and

2551
02:40:56.200 --> 02:41:00.880
it's just unbelievable.
Crazy.
Um,

2552
02:41:01.090 --> 02:41:05.230
you know,
this is just completely off.
And for me,
this is the biggest fun at UNC.

2553
02:41:05.590 --> 02:41:09.550
<v 1>What a stud to step up on 12 days notice.
Yeah.
He's a real man.</v>

2554
02:41:09.700 --> 02:41:12.840
He has nothing and he's awesome.
No,
he has nothing to lose now

2555
02:41:14.390 --> 02:41:18.480
<v 2>for you,
but taking a fight like this where you did have a full camp,</v>

2556
02:41:18.720 --> 02:41:21.870
are there any regrets?
Is there anything right now in your mind?

2557
02:41:22.190 --> 02:41:23.720
<v 1>Well,
look at Frankie trying to get involved.</v>

2558
02:41:24.130 --> 02:41:25.300
<v 2>You,
I don't have any regrets.</v>

2559
02:41:25.640 --> 02:41:30.620
<v 1>Don't ruin his moment.
Frankie
shows,
he's obviously next.
Okay.</v>

2560
02:41:30.920 --> 02:41:33.500
<v 2>What feeling do you get a chance to get into here and fight?</v>

2561
02:41:33.520 --> 02:41:36.420
Whether it's a day notice there,
two weeks or a full camp.

2562
02:41:36.720 --> 02:41:41.370
You get in here to do it.
Uh,
you know,
I want to think,
Connor,
thank you so much.

2563
02:41:42.660 --> 02:41:45.300
<v 1>That's awesome man.
That's how it should be.
Damn.</v>

2564
02:41:45.301 --> 02:41:50.010
How about the ladies of Conor Mcgregor and then that
shit,

2565
02:41:50.011 --> 02:41:51.330
that guy's winning in life.

2566
02:41:52.720 --> 02:41:53.553
<v 2>Glass.</v>

2567
02:41:53.600 --> 02:41:58.310
<v 1>Wow.
What is going on?</v>

2568
02:41:58.311 --> 02:42:02.210
We just witness greatness.
People.
That's like watching Bruce Lee actually fight.

2569
02:42:02.750 --> 02:42:06.470
You're welcome.
But he's Irish.
You're welcome.
Wow.

2570
02:42:06.471 --> 02:42:09.650
An Amazing night,
ladies and gentlemen.

2571
02:42:09.800 --> 02:42:14.030
Phenomenal fight companion.
Freddy,
look at,
look at Frankie.
Oh,
he's a,
he's saying,

2572
02:42:14.120 --> 02:42:17.780
oh,
he's saying congrats
or are you saying let's do this.

2573
02:42:18.290 --> 02:42:22.530
Let's do Josie auto.
100% is next.
I mean,
what?
October.

2574
02:42:24.230 --> 02:42:28.070
It depends if,
if,
from what I heard with rumors with Connor and his knee,

2575
02:42:28.071 --> 02:42:31.580
if he has surgery,
you're looking at a little bit of a layoff.
Yeah.

2576
02:42:31.610 --> 02:42:35.890
I think October would be too soon.
Yeah,
I know.
That's what,
uh,
Josie wine.

2577
02:42:35.930 --> 02:42:40.100
It was October.
God,
it was incredible.

2578
02:42:40.180 --> 02:42:42.040
It doesn't get better.
Bigger than Conor McGregor.

2579
02:42:42.260 --> 02:42:46.170
Thank you for the opportunity and the growth and I've learned so much about

2580
02:42:46.171 --> 02:42:50.300
really you were a member,
you have a different different outlook on fighting now.

2581
02:42:50.450 --> 02:42:53.030
I do.
And um,
um,

2582
02:42:53.330 --> 02:42:57.080
I tried to watch fights with them at home,
but I always end up watching alone.

2583
02:42:57.800 --> 02:43:01.790
Well,
you can call me.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry by that.
You can,
oh,
I'm sorry.

2584
02:43:02.420 --> 02:43:05.420
I know you don't like that,
but I figured I'd check and make it our new couple.

2585
02:43:06.250 --> 02:43:08.440
Oh No.
Okay.

2586
02:43:09.380 --> 02:43:12.100
I want to say thank you for having me here.
Where can

2587
02:43:12.100 --> 02:43:16.000
<v 0>people find your brother Bobby Lee live on Twitter and Instagram is your next</v>

2588
02:43:16.001 --> 02:43:18.800
spot.
You on the road?
I'm at the comedy store and the next week,

2589
02:43:18.801 --> 02:43:23.190
where am I playing baby Lexington,
Kentucky.
Beautiful Tuck.
He said,

2590
02:43:23.191 --> 02:43:25.230
come see me and Kentucky be,

2591
02:43:25.231 --> 02:43:28.720
it was really good to see you on the planet.

2592
02:43:28.750 --> 02:43:32.580
Thank you so much for having me on a kid soon.
I can.

2593
02:43:33.440 --> 02:43:38.170
Wonderful girlfriend.
Thank you.
[inaudible] get in the car.

2594
02:43:38.200 --> 02:43:42.950
Hey Man,
look at Conor Mcgregor.
Zero dead

2595
02:43:47.980 --> 02:43:52.210
killed it.
You guys kill how you do.
Go to go kill it.

2596
02:43:55.110 --> 02:44:00.090
Thank you.
Go go like five more,
right?
Yeah.

2597
02:44:00.420 --> 02:44:03.920
Yeah.
You killed it.
You guys are,
hey,

2598
02:44:05.170 --> 02:44:09.790
Bobby Lee in a smoke show girl brand.
Who knew a shitload about the USC shirt.

2599
02:44:09.791 --> 02:44:13.810
Did he faded out?
Bobby last two hours.

2600
02:44:14.410 --> 02:44:19.300
He didn't say a word that was tough on him.
Dude,
that was so unbelievable.

2601
02:44:19.480 --> 02:44:23.380
Greatest fight in UFC history.
Most exciting.
I mean,

2602
02:44:23.381 --> 02:44:27.400
I just don't know what to say about it.
I've never seen anything like that.

2603
02:44:27.450 --> 02:44:32.230
Just keeps backing it up and now backed it up in the second round with one of

2604
02:44:32.231 --> 02:44:34.960
the baddest dudes.
Tell you what can we had a bet tee shirt?

2605
02:44:34.961 --> 02:44:38.170
Do you like teachers sales?
So you're going to get the turbo sled sales.

2606
02:44:39.500 --> 02:44:44.100
Wow.
We get all the tee shirts and it's not a month.

2607
02:44:44.200 --> 02:44:47.340
We're only releasing one shirt in July.
Just one insurance.

2608
02:44:47.350 --> 02:44:50.860
That's with turbo sled.
So we have tourists letting black and gold coming out.

2609
02:44:50.920 --> 02:44:52.780
Yeah,
I like that.
Your grain black.

2610
02:44:53.020 --> 02:44:54.800
I can't believe we were making terrible sledge shirt.

2611
02:44:54.830 --> 02:44:57.550
I thought it was a horrible idea,
but when Rogan blasts it out,

2612
02:44:59.530 --> 02:45:02.830
then also Carol get,
I'll say will get us into where one,
that'd be perfect.

2613
02:45:02.920 --> 02:45:06.600
Should be,
you're not mad at this Joe Rogan shirt.
Jamie hooked me up dude.

2614
02:45:06.610 --> 02:45:08.860
I get one.
I am looking that,

2615
02:45:09.250 --> 02:45:12.130
look at that killer's row.

2616
02:45:12.850 --> 02:45:17.060
Ricardo Lamas just hanging in the back there.
Good luck.
Beaten Frank Gig.

2617
02:45:17.110 --> 02:45:20.320
Everybody.
Yeah.
Oh,
thing's a disaster.

2618
02:45:20.740 --> 02:45:25.350
I'm tell you what dog ordered my Conor Mcgregor Reebok Kit as we're on air air.

2619
02:45:25.360 --> 02:45:30.340
That should be coming in the mail.
I am a fan.
This whole event tonight.

2620
02:45:30.341 --> 02:45:33.850
I've never seen anything like it from the lay ins to the hype.

2621
02:45:33.940 --> 02:45:38.470
This is the first fight where when I was driving down here to Rogan studio,

2622
02:45:38.710 --> 02:45:41.260
I felt like everyone's rushing home to watch this fight.

2623
02:45:41.320 --> 02:45:45.910
I've never seen that before.
Is that Frankie Edgar Fighting Robbie Lawler?
Uh,
no.

2624
02:45:45.911 --> 02:45:50.650
That's Bj Penn.
Brian,
let's talk.
Let's wrap up the night though.
Yeah.
Um,

2625
02:45:50.790 --> 02:45:54.460
um,
no,
I think it was,
I think I've ever seen.
I bought Robbie Lawler.

2626
02:45:55.560 --> 02:45:56.201
No,
he did it.

2627
02:45:56.201 --> 02:45:59.710
That's Bj Penn to sona of bundling and slapped the shit out of the Cowen.

2628
02:45:59.730 --> 02:46:03.580
God dammit.
Why do we fight Robbie Lawler in the UFC?
I don't know.

2629
02:46:03.581 --> 02:46:06.520
It looks like it felon.
Let's wrap the show.
Get

2630
02:46:08.200 --> 02:46:11.980
most exciting the fight.
I've never seen a UFC event like this ever.
Ever.

2631
02:46:12.320 --> 02:46:14.720
From the singing,
from the hype,

2632
02:46:14.990 --> 02:46:18.650
from Conor Mcgregor being down and out and now guess what?

2633
02:46:18.651 --> 02:46:21.680
This sets up Josie,
Aldo Conner.

2634
02:46:21.890 --> 02:46:24.170
What's the chances they do that biggest thing.

2635
02:46:24.200 --> 02:46:27.230
Biggest in Ireland based thing ever.
Hands down.
Biggest fight of all time.
Yeah.

2636
02:46:27.720 --> 02:46:30.560
You tell Connor was worn out.
It's too much media.
Hey UFC.

2637
02:46:30.561 --> 02:46:34.850
Don't make them do that much media.
I'll tell you what though.
USC took a risk.

2638
02:46:34.880 --> 02:46:38.120
Put them in there against Chad and boy did it.
Pay Off it.
Pay Off.

2639
02:46:38.230 --> 02:46:42.730
That's like Ben,
I'm black and boy it hit.
I know that's been on double zero.

2640
02:46:43.720 --> 02:46:46.730
Very easily gone the other way and just killed the entire show.

2641
02:46:47.450 --> 02:46:51.560
How happy is the UFC?
Let's be real happy.
Am I?
How happy are we?
Yeah,

2642
02:46:52.190 --> 02:46:55.970
I think that's a wrap.
You good,
Jamie guys,

2643
02:46:56.030 --> 02:47:01.030
thanks for listening to the fight companion without the head chief.

2644
02:47:01.500 --> 02:47:04.550
Whoa.
Joe Rogan.
He took the,
you took the wheel on this one.

2645
02:47:04.551 --> 02:47:07.410
I'd say you're the captain.
Well,
when Joe was gone,
I got,
you know,

2646
02:47:07.411 --> 02:47:10.940
it could get a little wild or you never know my man to you and I were like a

2647
02:47:10.941 --> 02:47:14.440
captain co captain.
It's like pip and Jordan when it comes to fighting notes,

2648
02:47:14.441 --> 02:47:16.700
it's best that you take the,
if you take the lead.
Yeah.

2649
02:47:16.701 --> 02:47:20.510
Maybe the replay in the brown means.
Anyways,
we're going to get out of here.

2650
02:47:20.660 --> 02:47:23.360
The show where you can find this is the fighter and the kid.

2651
02:47:23.630 --> 02:47:26.120
I'll see Joe Rogan experience.
They're both great.

2652
02:47:26.360 --> 02:47:31.340
This is the fight to her companion,
the fight companion and joy.

2653
02:47:31.370 --> 02:47:33.830
Hope you got as much fun as we did wear out.

2654
02:47:38.740 --> 02:47:38.970
<v 6>Yeah.</v>
