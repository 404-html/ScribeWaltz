WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.020
<v Speaker 1>Goes to show you,</v>

2
00:00:01.021 --> 00:00:02.430
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to find that we're back up.</v>

3
00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:02.941
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>

4
00:00:02.941 --> 00:00:05.910
<v Speaker 1>You stream how tweet everybody we're back up.</v>

5
00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:11.193
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6
00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.441
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

7
00:00:12.441 --> 00:00:13.470
<v Speaker 1>So the um,</v>

8
00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:17.240
<v Speaker 1>you know that the way that the Shamans continued explaining fifth dimension is</v>

9
00:00:17.241 --> 00:00:18.074
<v Speaker 1>the dream state.</v>

10
00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:18.710
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

11
00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.220
<v Speaker 1>that's you access that sleeping and you also access that on a general level in</v>

12
00:00:22.221 --> 00:00:23.450
<v Speaker 1>psychedelic experiences.</v>

13
00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.310
<v Speaker 1>Sixth dimension is the realm,</v>

14
00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:26.000
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

15
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.900
<v Speaker 1>is the spirit realm.</v>

16
00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:27.793
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

17
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.160
<v Speaker 1>the kind of the master that realm is the earth mother is nature itself.</v>

18
00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:32.540
<v Speaker 1>So the snakes that came,</v>

19
00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:33.201
<v Speaker 1>that yields,</v>

20
00:00:33.201 --> 00:00:33.770
<v Speaker 1>that came,</v>

21
00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:34.820
<v Speaker 1>that's the fifth amendment.</v>

22
00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:35.370
<v Speaker 1>The sixth,</v>

23
00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:35.841
<v Speaker 1>sixth,</v>

24
00:00:35.841 --> 00:00:36.561
<v Speaker 1>that's the sixth.</v>

25
00:00:36.561 --> 00:00:38.000
<v Speaker 1>And what are we in?</v>

26
00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:39.440
<v Speaker 1>We're in the third,</v>

27
00:00:39.441 --> 00:00:43.190
<v Speaker 1>third and fourth time operates Taj just time,</v>

28
00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:44.083
<v Speaker 1>linear time.</v>

29
00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:46.640
<v Speaker 1>And was in the fifth is the dream state.</v>

30
00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:47.510
<v Speaker 1>The dream state.</v>

31
00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:48.080
<v Speaker 1>Dream state.</v>

32
00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.230
<v Speaker 1>The collective unconsciousness of all humankind is the fifth.</v>

33
00:00:51.231 --> 00:00:52.250
<v Speaker 1>And that's why when you dream,</v>

34
00:00:52.251 --> 00:00:54.290
<v Speaker 1>you can access things outside of yourself.</v>

35
00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:55.423
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

36
00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:55.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

37
00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.790
<v Speaker 1>think of things that you wouldn't have thought of because if somebody else had</v>

38
00:00:58.791 --> 00:00:59.624
<v Speaker 1>ever thought of it,</v>

39
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:00.141
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

40
00:01:00.141 --> 00:01:02.000
<v Speaker 1>you can access that in the fifth dimension,</v>

41
00:01:02.001 --> 00:01:03.710
<v Speaker 1>the dream state outside of time.</v>

42
00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:05.930
<v Speaker 1>So then the sixth is,</v>

43
00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:06.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

44
00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:07.220
<v Speaker 1>that's the spirit realm.</v>

45
00:01:07.221 --> 00:01:10.820
<v Speaker 1>That's where if you're going to communicate with any of these totem animals or</v>

46
00:01:10.821 --> 00:01:11.840
<v Speaker 1>guides or anything,</v>

47
00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:13.880
<v Speaker 1>and they actually say when you smoked DMT,</v>

48
00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.660
<v Speaker 1>you get kind of dropped directly right in the sixth dimension.</v>

49
00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.440
<v Speaker 1>And there's beings in there that you see and it's very common report from people</v>

50
00:01:21.441 --> 00:01:23.600
<v Speaker 1>smoking Dmt did you see beings?</v>

51
00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.100
<v Speaker 1>And it's because you get rocket shipped directly into the sixth dimension where</v>

52
00:01:28.101 --> 00:01:32.120
<v Speaker 1>you're going to encounter these different beings that exist in that dimension.</v>

53
00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:32.680
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

54
00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.940
<v Speaker 1>but the overlord of that kind of dimension is his mother earth.</v>

55
00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.510
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of the things you see are kind of animalistic based,</v>

56
00:01:38.511 --> 00:01:39.590
<v Speaker 1>especially for the people in the,</v>

57
00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.610
<v Speaker 1>in the junk.</v>

58
00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:42.290
<v Speaker 1>Maybe there's different paradigms of that.</v>

59
00:01:42.291 --> 00:01:46.520
<v Speaker 1>But then the seventh dimension beyond that is the realm of energy,</v>

60
00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:47.060
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

61
00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.260
<v Speaker 1>energetic vibration and large and large entities.</v>

62
00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:55.250
<v Speaker 1>And that's where they say the ships came from for me was the seventh dimension.</v>

63
00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.300
<v Speaker 1>And the purpose of the ships was to prepare me for travel to the eighth</v>

64
00:01:59.301 --> 00:02:00.134
<v Speaker 1>dimension,</v>

65
00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.810
<v Speaker 1>which is the realm of pure potentiality,</v>

66
00:02:02.811 --> 00:02:03.530
<v Speaker 1>they call it,</v>

67
00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.310
<v Speaker 1>where you can really affect change on all the dimensions before,</v>

68
00:02:07.311 --> 00:02:10.460
<v Speaker 1>including the third and the fourth affect change in the physical body.</v>

69
00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:12.440
<v Speaker 1>Basically access,</v>

70
00:02:12.441 --> 00:02:13.760
<v Speaker 1>see things in your life,</v>

71
00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.430
<v Speaker 1>have a completely different perspective outside of time.</v>

72
00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.380
<v Speaker 1>And that's the eighth dimension.</v>

73
00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.970
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

74
00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:20.960
<v Speaker 1>kind of the final dimension that you can arrive.</v>

75
00:02:20.961 --> 00:02:21.640
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

76
00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:22.030
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

77
00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

78
00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.190
<v Speaker 1>they explained this all after after I had went through and then said,</v>

79
00:02:25.191 --> 00:02:25.431
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

80
00:02:25.431 --> 00:02:27.080
<v Speaker 1>this was where you were here.</v>

81
00:02:27.081 --> 00:02:28.280
<v Speaker 1>This is why you're here.</v>

82
00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.941
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

83
00:02:28.941 --> 00:02:29.211
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

84
00:02:29.211 --> 00:02:30.044
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

85
00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:31.240
<v Speaker 1>based on my experience,</v>

86
00:02:31.241 --> 00:02:32.300
<v Speaker 1>it might all sound crazy,</v>

87
00:02:32.301 --> 00:02:33.890
<v Speaker 1>but it's a paradigm that,</v>

88
00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.000
<v Speaker 1>that seems to work for me because I lived it and I was there and I did it.</v>

89
00:02:38.001 --> 00:02:38.834
<v Speaker 1>And I saw,</v>

90
00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

91
00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.420
<v Speaker 1>I've seen the physical benefits of what happened when I got to be eight</v>

92
00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.831
<v Speaker 1>dimensioned.</v>

93
00:02:42.831 --> 00:02:45.320
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't like I just got there and no good stuff happened.</v>

94
00:02:45.321 --> 00:02:45.740
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

95
00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:46.371
<v Speaker 1>my business,</v>

96
00:02:46.371 --> 00:02:47.330
<v Speaker 1>the decisions I've made,</v>

97
00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:48.440
<v Speaker 1>I've been huge.</v>

98
00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.711
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

99
00:02:48.711 --> 00:02:49.700
<v Speaker 1>things are going really well.</v>

100
00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:50.660
<v Speaker 1>My health is great.</v>

101
00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:51.320
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

102
00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.951
<v Speaker 1>my buddy's good,</v>

103
00:02:51.951 --> 00:02:52.461
<v Speaker 1>but who knows,</v>

104
00:02:52.461 --> 00:02:53.540
<v Speaker 1>that wasn't very scientific.</v>

105
00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:55.760
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to put that one up in the win column.</v>

106
00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.450
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

107
00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:56.990
<v Speaker 1>cause I didn't.</v>

108
00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.823
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>

109
00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:58.311
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

110
00:02:58.311 --> 00:03:00.190
<v Speaker 1>I'm not that</v>

111
00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:05.410
<v Speaker 3>what we experience in a hallucination in,</v>

112
00:03:05.411 --> 00:03:09.550
<v Speaker 3>in that form isn't absolutely real,</v>

113
00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:12.400
<v Speaker 3>but it's just we can't put it in a box.</v>

114
00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.730
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

115
00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:13.490
<v Speaker 3>you can't,</v>

116
00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:14.410
<v Speaker 3>you can't weigh it.</v>

117
00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.660
<v Speaker 3>You can't hit it with a hammer,</v>

118
00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:16.950
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

119
00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:17.800
<v Speaker 3>making noise,</v>

120
00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:18.430
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

121
00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.790
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

122
00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:23.290
<v Speaker 3>But it's the idea that is just your imagination.</v>

123
00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.800
<v Speaker 3>People like poo poo that like it's just your imagination.</v>

124
00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.470
<v Speaker 3>What is your imagination man?</v>

125
00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.140
<v Speaker 3>Your imagination is a crazy fucking thing.</v>

126
00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:37.380
<v Speaker 3>All these neurons and cells are firing and somehow or another through these</v>

127
00:03:38.291 --> 00:03:43.291
<v Speaker 3>ideas manifest themselves or they can manifest themselves as solid objects.</v>

128
00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:47.590
<v Speaker 3>Like the person had figured out the wheel or the guy wore,</v>

129
00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:48.940
<v Speaker 3>makes a fucking computer.</v>

130
00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:54.120
<v Speaker 3>These are all real things that have somehow another emerged into this dimension</v>

131
00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:59.760
<v Speaker 3>from this ether old dimension of thoughts and ideas and done it through a human</v>

132
00:04:00.641 --> 00:04:01.210
<v Speaker 3>being.</v>

133
00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:02.110
<v Speaker 3>And we look at it as like,</v>

134
00:04:02.111 --> 00:04:02.650
<v Speaker 3>no big deal.</v>

135
00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:02.890
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

136
00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:03.340
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

137
00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:04.720
<v Speaker 3>he thought of it and then he made it.</v>

138
00:04:04.721 --> 00:04:05.920
<v Speaker 3>It's just his imagination.</v>

139
00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:07.980
<v Speaker 3>Oh you were in the eighth dimension.</v>

140
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.833
<v Speaker 3>Sure you were.</v>

141
00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:10.090
<v Speaker 3>That's just your imagination.</v>

142
00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.250
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck is your imagination?</v>

143
00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:15.620
<v Speaker 3>We are very light with our,</v>

144
00:04:15.621 --> 00:04:20.621
<v Speaker 3>our appreciation of that and very light with are very lax with our all as far as</v>

145
00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:23.330
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

146
00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:24.120
<v Speaker 3>what the,</v>

147
00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.380
<v Speaker 3>the dimension of the imaginations brings us.</v>

148
00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:27.220
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's,</v>

149
00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.080
<v Speaker 3>that's a crazy fucking thing.</v>

150
00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:30.680
<v Speaker 3>The idea that the uh,</v>

151
00:04:30.681 --> 00:04:35.681
<v Speaker 3>the world of thoughts and ideas is actually some sort of an intangible</v>

152
00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:39.310
<v Speaker 3>experience that's like right there.</v>

153
00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:44.260
<v Speaker 3>And from that you can pull things out and create them in and put them and then</v>

154
00:04:44.261 --> 00:04:46.690
<v Speaker 3>you stack them up on top of each other and you know,</v>

155
00:04:46.691 --> 00:04:47.800
<v Speaker 3>and then their physical,</v>

156
00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:49.300
<v Speaker 3>they become a different thing.</v>

157
00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:50.920
<v Speaker 3>But it's from the imagination.</v>

158
00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:53.080
<v Speaker 3>Everything is from the imagination.</v>

159
00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:54.670
<v Speaker 3>So the idea you saying,</v>

160
00:04:54.671 --> 00:04:54.881
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

161
00:04:54.881 --> 00:04:55.620
<v Speaker 3>anybody that would,</v>

162
00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:55.910
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

163
00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:56.470
<v Speaker 3>critique it.</v>

164
00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:57.520
<v Speaker 3>Oh you saw drag Lawrence.</v>

165
00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:58.220
<v Speaker 3>Sure you're doing it.</v>

166
00:04:58.220 --> 00:04:59.053
<v Speaker 3>You saw snakes.</v>

167
00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:00.640
<v Speaker 3>That's just your imagination.</v>

168
00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.070
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what that exactly means.</v>

169
00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:03.461
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

170
00:05:03.461 --> 00:05:03.681
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>

171
00:05:03.681 --> 00:05:04.930
<v Speaker 3>when you see something,</v>

172
00:05:04.931 --> 00:05:09.820
<v Speaker 3>even if it's a hallucination and it's changing your fucking life,</v>

173
00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:14.940
<v Speaker 3>cause it's whatever it's teaching you or whatever it's showing you or whatever</v>

174
00:05:15.161 --> 00:05:20.161
<v Speaker 3>leverage that it uses to pry your ego's grasp free of your life for whatever</v>

175
00:05:21.521 --> 00:05:26.080
<v Speaker 3>amount of time that allows you to sort of reset your rpms and fucking start a</v>

176
00:05:26.081 --> 00:05:27.850
<v Speaker 3>new with fresh purpose.</v>

177
00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:29.260
<v Speaker 3>That's real.</v>

178
00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:29.800
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

179
00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:31.030
<v Speaker 3>That's fucking real.</v>

180
00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:34.480
<v Speaker 3>That UFO you saw was real.</v>

181
00:05:34.481 --> 00:05:35.230
<v Speaker 3>It was real.</v>

182
00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:36.100
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying?</v>

183
00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:38.500
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck is the imagination?</v>

184
00:05:38.501 --> 00:05:43.501
<v Speaker 3>Does someone have to pour alloy into a mold and carve those things on it for it</v>

185
00:05:43.811 --> 00:05:44.440
<v Speaker 3>to be real?</v>

186
00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:48.670
<v Speaker 3>Do you have to be able to walk up and hit it and make a claim for it to be real?</v>

187
00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:49.870
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

188
00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:51.940
<v Speaker 3>It's just how it interacts with you.</v>

189
00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:55.870
<v Speaker 3>Any kind of invention was made from your imagination,</v>

190
00:05:55.871 --> 00:05:56.470
<v Speaker 3>so.</v>

191
00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:56.930
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

192
00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:57.651
<v Speaker 3>So it's like,</v>

193
00:05:57.651 --> 00:05:58.390
<v Speaker 3>who cares</v>

194
00:05:58.390 --> 00:05:58.570
<v Speaker 4>if,</v>

195
00:05:58.570 --> 00:05:58.651
<v Speaker 4>if,</v>

196
00:05:58.651 --> 00:06:01.370
<v Speaker 4>if they teach you how to make the next fucking computer,</v>

197
00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:02.840
<v Speaker 4>then don't say,</v>

198
00:06:02.841 --> 00:06:03.441
<v Speaker 4>who cares?</v>

199
00:06:03.441 --> 00:06:04.400
<v Speaker 4>It's just your imagination.</v>

200
00:06:04.401 --> 00:06:07.460
<v Speaker 4>Cause that shit might teach you something just like these,</v>

201
00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:07.850
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

202
00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:08.683
<v Speaker 4>tools from,</v>

203
00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:08.991
<v Speaker 4>from,</v>

204
00:06:08.991 --> 00:06:09.291
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

205
00:06:09.291 --> 00:06:10.430
<v Speaker 4>the Egyptian Times.</v>

206
00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:11.170
<v Speaker 4>They were,</v>

207
00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:12.003
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

208
00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:14.120
<v Speaker 4>tools out of their imagination.</v>

209
00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:14.391
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

210
00:06:14.391 --> 00:06:16.340
<v Speaker 3>And if you believe in things,</v>

211
00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:17.600
<v Speaker 3>if you believe in things,</v>

212
00:06:17.601 --> 00:06:19.520
<v Speaker 3>they have incredible power over you.</v>

213
00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:20.150
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

214
00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:21.560
<v Speaker 3>Both good and bad.</v>

215
00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:22.580
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

216
00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:24.530
<v Speaker 3>And who's to say that's not real.</v>

217
00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:25.041
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

218
00:06:25.041 --> 00:06:25.520
<v Speaker 3>there's like the,</v>

219
00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:27.410
<v Speaker 3>the idea of the placebo effect.</v>

220
00:06:27.411 --> 00:06:30.020
<v Speaker 3>Like I give you a sugar pill and all of a sudden you feel better because you</v>

221
00:06:30.021 --> 00:06:31.280
<v Speaker 3>thought I gave you medicine.</v>

222
00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:32.091
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

223
00:06:32.091 --> 00:06:33.470
<v Speaker 3>still you feel better.</v>

224
00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:34.190
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

225
00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:38.870
<v Speaker 3>people have actually been cured of ailments because of the placebo effect.</v>

226
00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:40.880
<v Speaker 3>So what the fuck is happening where people,</v>

227
00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:44.270
<v Speaker 3>people have this misconception that it works only one way.</v>

228
00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:47.870
<v Speaker 3>That you know that the body can affect the mind,</v>

229
00:06:47.871 --> 00:06:49.310
<v Speaker 3>but the mind can affect the body.</v>

230
00:06:49.311 --> 00:06:49.611
<v Speaker 3>Oh No,</v>

231
00:06:49.611 --> 00:06:51.200
<v Speaker 3>you can't go backwards on that road,</v>

232
00:06:51.201 --> 00:06:51.921
<v Speaker 3>but it's bullshit.</v>

233
00:06:51.921 --> 00:06:52.161
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

234
00:06:52.161 --> 00:06:54.380
<v Speaker 3>your mind can make changes in your body.</v>

235
00:06:54.381 --> 00:06:55.214
<v Speaker 3>How do you think these,</v>

236
00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:55.611
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

237
00:06:55.611 --> 00:06:59.420
<v Speaker 3>these people are able to do things like slow their heart rate or walk on coals</v>

238
00:06:59.421 --> 00:07:00.410
<v Speaker 3>and not get burned.</v>

239
00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:00.760
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

240
00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:01.180
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

241
00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:05.720
<v Speaker 3>they're able to focus some kind of walked down coals who's to trick.</v>

242
00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:06.621
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it is.</v>

243
00:07:06.621 --> 00:07:07.300
<v Speaker 3>I don't think,</v>

244
00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:08.270
<v Speaker 3>I've never walked on calls,</v>

245
00:07:08.271 --> 00:07:09.000
<v Speaker 3>but whatever,</v>

246
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.010
<v Speaker 3>you just gotta keep moving.</v>

247
00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:10.330
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

248
00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:12.110
<v Speaker 3>what they can do things with pain.</v>

249
00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:15.860
<v Speaker 3>I mean you should have these people who go to trans and really kind of stop the</v>

250
00:07:15.861 --> 00:07:16.461
<v Speaker 3>pain from,</v>

251
00:07:16.461 --> 00:07:16.580
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

252
00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:20.750
<v Speaker 3>from affecting women and certain people whose beliefs of certainly heal things</v>

253
00:07:20.751 --> 00:07:22.160
<v Speaker 3>that the doctors thought were impossible.</v>

254
00:07:22.161 --> 00:07:26.330
<v Speaker 3>But the idea that the mind can't affect the body I think is one of the biggest</v>

255
00:07:26.331 --> 00:07:28.550
<v Speaker 3>problems and misconceptions in western medicine.</v>

256
00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:29.650
<v Speaker 3>It's certainly Ken,</v>

257
00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:31.010
<v Speaker 3>we all know people who are super,</v>

258
00:07:31.011 --> 00:07:31.701
<v Speaker 3>super negative,</v>

259
00:07:31.701 --> 00:07:33.200
<v Speaker 3>one up getting really sick too.</v>

260
00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:34.760
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

261
00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:35.421
<v Speaker 3>that's real.</v>

262
00:07:35.421 --> 00:07:35.900
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>

263
00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:37.830
<v Speaker 3>I've had moments in my life where my,</v>

264
00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:40.550
<v Speaker 3>I was too stressed out and I wasn't balanced.</v>

265
00:07:40.551 --> 00:07:42.770
<v Speaker 3>And those are almost always the moments where you want them getting sick.</v>

266
00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:44.930
<v Speaker 3>And there's a direct correlation between that.</v>

267
00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:45.411
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

268
00:07:45.411 --> 00:07:49.310
<v Speaker 3>there's a direct correlation between positive energy and positive results in the</v>

269
00:07:49.311 --> 00:07:50.180
<v Speaker 3>physical form.</v>

270
00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:50.540
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

271
00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:50.781
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

272
00:07:50.781 --> 00:07:51.710
<v Speaker 3>they're all connected.</v>

273
00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:54.500
<v Speaker 3>One of the DMT trips that I had never,</v>

274
00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:57.770
<v Speaker 3>never forget this because it was a real life changing experience.</v>

275
00:07:58.130 --> 00:07:58.760
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

276
00:07:58.760 --> 00:07:59.031
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

277
00:07:59.031 --> 00:08:02.990
<v Speaker 3>the DMT trip is like being shot through a cannon to the center of the universe</v>

278
00:08:02.991 --> 00:08:05.720
<v Speaker 3>and all of a sudden you have all the information around you all the time,</v>

279
00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:08.300
<v Speaker 3>but it's like they're slippery dolphins.</v>

280
00:08:08.301 --> 00:08:09.380
<v Speaker 3>He can't grab them.</v>

281
00:08:09.381 --> 00:08:10.970
<v Speaker 3>It's like all the information's there,</v>

282
00:08:10.971 --> 00:08:13.130
<v Speaker 3>but it's like you can't harness it.</v>

283
00:08:13.131 --> 00:08:13.580
<v Speaker 3>You don't,</v>

284
00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:14.420
<v Speaker 3>you can't figure it out.</v>

285
00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:15.980
<v Speaker 3>And it's very,</v>

286
00:08:15.981 --> 00:08:19.280
<v Speaker 3>very overwhelming and it can be terrifying.</v>

287
00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:21.830
<v Speaker 3>And in one trip that I had,</v>

288
00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:25.490
<v Speaker 3>I got real scared in the middle of it and I started thinking all this negative</v>

289
00:08:25.491 --> 00:08:26.324
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>

290
00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:27.680
<v Speaker 3>It just got away from me.</v>

291
00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:28.903
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

292
00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:31.340
<v Speaker 3>as I was thinking all this negative shit,</v>

293
00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:36.520
<v Speaker 3>the DMT trip became black and green and dark and it became like Jag id and then</v>

294
00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:39.883
<v Speaker 3>it just like,</v>

295
00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:42.120
<v Speaker 3>it just looked harsh and it,</v>

296
00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:45.830
<v Speaker 3>it looked like it started to be almost like cancerous.</v>

297
00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:48.590
<v Speaker 3>It looked like it was growing and it was,</v>

298
00:08:48.591 --> 00:08:52.020
<v Speaker 3>it was moving in in an asymmetrical way.</v>

299
00:08:52.021 --> 00:08:53.120
<v Speaker 3>It was just fucked up.</v>

300
00:08:53.121 --> 00:08:53.540
<v Speaker 3>It was.</v>

301
00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:54.380
<v Speaker 3>And then I realized,</v>

302
00:08:54.381 --> 00:08:54.651
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

303
00:08:54.651 --> 00:08:56.730
<v Speaker 3>this you're thinking negative,</v>

304
00:08:56.731 --> 00:08:58.380
<v Speaker 3>stop thinking negative,</v>

305
00:08:58.650 --> 00:09:00.060
<v Speaker 3>think positive,</v>

306
00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:01.500
<v Speaker 3>relax,</v>

307
00:09:01.501 --> 00:09:02.041
<v Speaker 3>let go.</v>

308
00:09:02.041 --> 00:09:03.870
<v Speaker 3>And as I'm saying all these things,</v>

309
00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:08.990
<v Speaker 3>the colors are slowly changing and then when I completely relaxed and went boom</v>

310
00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:13.440
<v Speaker 3>and it blossomed into these beautiful geometric patterns.</v>

311
00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:16.920
<v Speaker 3>It's like once I started thinking positive and going,</v>

312
00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:17.370
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

313
00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:17.611
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

314
00:09:17.611 --> 00:09:18.331
<v Speaker 3>this is just silly.</v>

315
00:09:18.331 --> 00:09:19.590
<v Speaker 3>You can control your mind.</v>

316
00:09:19.591 --> 00:09:20.160
<v Speaker 3>Think Po,</v>

317
00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:20.993
<v Speaker 3>let go,</v>

318
00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:22.020
<v Speaker 3>love,</v>

319
00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:23.033
<v Speaker 3>love,</v>

320
00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:24.263
<v Speaker 3>boom,</v>

321
00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:25.163
<v Speaker 3>boom.</v>

322
00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:27.780
<v Speaker 3>It like showed me in a physical form,</v>

323
00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:31.500
<v Speaker 3>like something that I could actually look at and watch.</v>

324
00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:36.620
<v Speaker 3>I could see negative energy and positive energy and that the lesson was that</v>

325
00:09:37.111 --> 00:09:39.960
<v Speaker 3>these can be controlled to a certain extent.</v>

326
00:09:39.961 --> 00:09:43.680
<v Speaker 3>They can be managed and they can certainly be managed by your intent and your</v>

327
00:09:43.681 --> 00:09:44.910
<v Speaker 3>attitude and your ideas.</v>

328
00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:45.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

329
00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:46.550
<v Speaker 1>no doubt about it.</v>

330
00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:47.383
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's a,</v>

331
00:09:47.770 --> 00:09:51.200
<v Speaker 1>it's a powerful lesson to learn is to be able to manage that.</v>

332
00:09:51.201 --> 00:09:52.130
<v Speaker 1>Not only when you're on,</v>

333
00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:53.270
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's psychedelic.</v>

334
00:09:53.271 --> 00:09:53.810
<v Speaker 1>That's like,</v>

335
00:09:53.810 --> 00:09:54.920
<v Speaker 1>that's like when you're in the,</v>

336
00:09:55.610 --> 00:09:57.020
<v Speaker 1>that's the real game time,</v>

337
00:09:57.021 --> 00:09:57.171
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

338
00:09:57.171 --> 00:09:58.070
<v Speaker 1>that's the playoffs.</v>

339
00:09:58.071 --> 00:10:01.040
<v Speaker 1>That's when you need to bring all your training and practice to bear because</v>

340
00:10:01.041 --> 00:10:01.580
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

341
00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:02.750
<v Speaker 1>everything is magnified.</v>

342
00:10:02.751 --> 00:10:03.800
<v Speaker 1>You're under the microcosm.</v>

343
00:10:03.890 --> 00:10:05.660
<v Speaker 1>You know you don't in a real intense moment,</v>

344
00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:09.180
<v Speaker 3>you don't know yourself until you have a psychedelic experience.</v>

345
00:10:09.181 --> 00:10:10.440
<v Speaker 3>You might think you know yourself,</v>

346
00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:14.460
<v Speaker 3>but I guarantee you you're going to find out who you really fucking art when you</v>

347
00:10:14.461 --> 00:10:15.260
<v Speaker 3>go deep.</v>

348
00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:18.390
<v Speaker 3>And then when you go deep and you come back and you have to kind of assess</v>

349
00:10:18.391 --> 00:10:21.150
<v Speaker 3>everything and you look at yourself through fresh eyes,</v>

350
00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:23.940
<v Speaker 3>the the ego while you're sleeping,</v>

351
00:10:23.941 --> 00:10:24.930
<v Speaker 3>while you're working,</v>

352
00:10:24.931 --> 00:10:26.940
<v Speaker 3>while it's gaining ground,</v>

353
00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:28.590
<v Speaker 3>it's like the fucking fed.</v>

354
00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:33.390
<v Speaker 3>It's stealing money and just pocketing things and taking control over certain</v>

355
00:10:33.391 --> 00:10:34.050
<v Speaker 3>areas.</v>

356
00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:35.280
<v Speaker 3>It really is like the government,</v>

357
00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:40.050
<v Speaker 3>and then you don't realize how fucking embedded it's becoming your system until</v>

358
00:10:40.051 --> 00:10:41.280
<v Speaker 3>you have a blowout.</v>

359
00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:45.660
<v Speaker 3>He till have a psychedelic boom blow out experience and that ego good.</v>

360
00:10:45.661 --> 00:10:46.770
<v Speaker 3>Just shut the side.</v>

361
00:10:46.771 --> 00:10:47.280
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

362
00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:47.521
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

363
00:10:47.521 --> 00:10:52.020
<v Speaker 3>like a fucking explosion and a comic book movie and the Ego's sitting in a tree</v>

364
00:10:52.021 --> 00:10:52.441
<v Speaker 3>with half,</v>

365
00:10:52.441 --> 00:10:55.650
<v Speaker 3>it's close off hanging from branches because it just got blown out,</v>

366
00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:56.460
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

367
00:10:56.460 --> 00:10:57.030
<v Speaker 3>Then,</v>

368
00:10:57.030 --> 00:10:58.710
<v Speaker 3>then you get to see yourself again.</v>

369
00:10:58.740 --> 00:11:00.390
<v Speaker 3>Then you get to see who you really are.</v>

370
00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:03.210
<v Speaker 3>But the time off of that man,</v>

371
00:11:03.211 --> 00:11:05.700
<v Speaker 3>you gotta be real careful because that ego,</v>

372
00:11:05.701 --> 00:11:07.350
<v Speaker 3>he fucking gets out of that tree,</v>

373
00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:12.120
<v Speaker 3>fucking brushes himself off and clings a whole deal and starts running shit</v>

374
00:11:12.121 --> 00:11:12.511
<v Speaker 3>again.</v>

375
00:11:12.511 --> 00:11:14.460
<v Speaker 3>Listen to it be a lot easier to just let me handle this.</v>

376
00:11:14.461 --> 00:11:14.941
<v Speaker 3>I got this,</v>

377
00:11:14.941 --> 00:11:15.601
<v Speaker 3>I got this dude,</v>

378
00:11:15.601 --> 00:11:16.470
<v Speaker 3>you're the shit.</v>

379
00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:18.930
<v Speaker 3>Okay you're going to do this because you're the fucking man.</v>

380
00:11:18.931 --> 00:11:19.321
<v Speaker 3>Trust me,</v>

381
00:11:19.321 --> 00:11:19.831
<v Speaker 3>have a seat,</v>

382
00:11:19.831 --> 00:11:20.610
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to drive.</v>

383
00:11:20.610 --> 00:11:23.110
<v Speaker 3>And then next thing you know the fucking Egos in control again,</v>

384
00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:25.380
<v Speaker 3>your life is fucking confusing.</v>

385
00:11:26.390 --> 00:11:27.770
<v Speaker 1>I think that's why it happens.</v>

386
00:11:27.771 --> 00:11:28.630
<v Speaker 1>Even to the Shamans,</v>

387
00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:29.630
<v Speaker 1>you know the masters,</v>

388
00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:31.100
<v Speaker 1>this is not something that they're,</v>

389
00:11:31.410 --> 00:11:31.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

390
00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:32.570
<v Speaker 1>void of,</v>

391
00:11:32.570 --> 00:11:32.751
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

392
00:11:32.751 --> 00:11:36.560
<v Speaker 1>cause they get a lot of power in their little communities and things and so the</v>

393
00:11:36.561 --> 00:11:38.030
<v Speaker 1>medicine has to bring them back.</v>

394
00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:38.480
<v Speaker 3>Well you're,</v>

395
00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:39.970
<v Speaker 3>you're a spiritual person,</v>

396
00:11:39.971 --> 00:11:41.050
<v Speaker 3>but you're also,</v>

397
00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:44.830
<v Speaker 3>I mean the idea of spiritual did the word is a weird tainted word.</v>

398
00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:46.420
<v Speaker 3>Unfortunately the word spiritual,</v>

399
00:11:46.421 --> 00:11:47.254
<v Speaker 3>so tainted,</v>

400
00:11:47.470 --> 00:11:47.830
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

401
00:11:47.830 --> 00:11:52.120
<v Speaker 3>automatically hippy nonsense comes into play when you start using that.</v>

402
00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:54.180
<v Speaker 3>But the line is your,</v>

403
00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:55.450
<v Speaker 3>you are thoughts and ideas,</v>

404
00:11:55.451 --> 00:11:57.460
<v Speaker 3>but you were also a physical,</v>

405
00:11:57.461 --> 00:12:02.410
<v Speaker 3>biological being a vehicle and just like your fucking car.</v>

406
00:12:02.411 --> 00:12:06.120
<v Speaker 3>We have to change the oil and you have to make sure that spark plugs are in</v>

407
00:12:06.170 --> 00:12:09.040
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] setting correctly and make sure that the computers tuned up.</v>

408
00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:09.311
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

409
00:12:09.311 --> 00:12:11.290
<v Speaker 3>you have to do that with your body as well.</v>

410
00:12:11.410 --> 00:12:13.870
<v Speaker 3>Your body is a vehicle and if you ignore it,</v>

411
00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:18.190
<v Speaker 3>much like your fucking car started spewing out black smoke and shits out and</v>

412
00:12:18.191 --> 00:12:19.180
<v Speaker 3>dies on the road,</v>

413
00:12:19.450 --> 00:12:22.300
<v Speaker 3>your body does the same goddamn thing it's your car can do.</v>

414
00:12:22.301 --> 00:12:24.040
<v Speaker 3>If you don't maintain it correctly,</v>

415
00:12:24.190 --> 00:12:25.120
<v Speaker 3>it will fuck with you.</v>

416
00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:26.350
<v Speaker 3>It will fuck with you.</v>

417
00:12:26.351 --> 00:12:27.011
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

418
00:12:27.011 --> 00:12:29.680
<v Speaker 3>and the ego is a part of the physical body.</v>

419
00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:30.221
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

420
00:12:30.221 --> 00:12:32.410
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't seem like it is because again,</v>

421
00:12:32.411 --> 00:12:33.640
<v Speaker 3>you can't fucking measure it.</v>

422
00:12:33.641 --> 00:12:35.170
<v Speaker 3>You can't beat on it with a hammer.</v>

423
00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:39.670
<v Speaker 3>But it is a part of who every fucking living organism that wants to stay alive,</v>

424
00:12:39.671 --> 00:12:40.660
<v Speaker 3>that has a conscious,</v>

425
00:12:41.010 --> 00:12:44.920
<v Speaker 3>a consciousness and has the ability to recognize that it's here that has self</v>

426
00:12:44.921 --> 00:12:45.754
<v Speaker 3>awareness.</v>

427
00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:48.190
<v Speaker 3>The Ego comes into play because that's how you stay alive.</v>

428
00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:49.360
<v Speaker 3>That's how you succeed.</v>

429
00:12:49.361 --> 00:12:50.500
<v Speaker 3>That's how you get girls.</v>

430
00:12:50.501 --> 00:12:51.820
<v Speaker 3>That's how you fucking get money.</v>

431
00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:52.691
<v Speaker 3>You get money,</v>

432
00:12:52.691 --> 00:12:54.010
<v Speaker 3>you work for the ego.</v>

433
00:12:54.011 --> 00:12:55.300
<v Speaker 3>The Ego is,</v>

434
00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:57.070
<v Speaker 3>it's a part of the machine,</v>

435
00:12:57.460 --> 00:12:58.510
<v Speaker 3>but it can get away from you.</v>

436
00:12:58.690 --> 00:12:59.090
<v Speaker 1>You've,</v>

437
00:12:59.090 --> 00:13:00.830
<v Speaker 1>you know what you're saying there,</v>

438
00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:03.830
<v Speaker 1>it touches on the very core of my entire philosophy in life,</v>

439
00:13:03.831 --> 00:13:04.670
<v Speaker 1>which is balanced.</v>

440
00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:04.911
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

441
00:13:04.911 --> 00:13:06.230
<v Speaker 1>and that's what the warrior poet is.</v>

442
00:13:06.231 --> 00:13:07.060
<v Speaker 1>It's the,</v>

443
00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:07.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

444
00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:09.920
<v Speaker 1>it's the Samurai that appreciates the cherry blossom tree.</v>

445
00:13:09.921 --> 00:13:10.161
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

446
00:13:10.161 --> 00:13:10.870
<v Speaker 1>it's the,</v>

447
00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:14.570
<v Speaker 1>it's gladiator when he's walking through the fields of wheat and in,</v>

448
00:13:14.630 --> 00:13:14.871
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

449
00:13:14.871 --> 00:13:19.370
<v Speaker 1>appreciating that it's the ability to maintain that kind of balance of both the</v>

450
00:13:19.371 --> 00:13:22.190
<v Speaker 1>physical side and the spiritual side and a,</v>

451
00:13:22.191 --> 00:13:23.060
<v Speaker 1>and really that's,</v>

452
00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:26.000
<v Speaker 1>I think the message I had one message to bring.</v>

453
00:13:26.001 --> 00:13:27.290
<v Speaker 1>It's like you got to have both.</v>

454
00:13:27.291 --> 00:13:30.860
<v Speaker 1>You can't just be this spiritual being only and go on these trips and stuff.</v>

455
00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:32.120
<v Speaker 1>You got to hone your body.</v>

456
00:13:32.121 --> 00:13:33.110
<v Speaker 1>You got to keep it healthy.</v>

457
00:13:33.111 --> 00:13:36.590
<v Speaker 1>You got to be able to operate in this world because in this,</v>

458
00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:37.820
<v Speaker 1>in this dimension you're in,</v>

459
00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:38.331
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

460
00:13:38.331 --> 00:13:39.260
<v Speaker 1>people aren't to,</v>

461
00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:39.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

462
00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:42.980
<v Speaker 1>lay down for you just because you have a higher spiritual truth.</v>

463
00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:45.530
<v Speaker 1>Like you have to bring both aspects to bear.</v>

464
00:13:45.531 --> 00:13:47.120
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's what we were supposed to do.</v>

465
00:13:47.390 --> 00:13:48.031
<v Speaker 1>And I think every,</v>

466
00:13:48.031 --> 00:13:50.840
<v Speaker 1>but almost everybody has to whack on either side.</v>

467
00:13:50.990 --> 00:13:51.201
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

468
00:13:51.201 --> 00:13:52.730
<v Speaker 1>there's the big muscle heads that are like,</v>

469
00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:53.391
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>

470
00:13:53.391 --> 00:13:55.430
<v Speaker 1>fuck that hippie bullshit crystals,</v>

471
00:13:55.431 --> 00:13:56.264
<v Speaker 1>eighth dimension,</v>

472
00:13:56.330 --> 00:13:57.470
<v Speaker 1>that fucking faggot.</v>

473
00:13:57.560 --> 00:13:58.250
<v Speaker 1>And then there's this,</v>

474
00:13:58.250 --> 00:13:58.491
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

475
00:13:58.491 --> 00:14:00.710
<v Speaker 1>the other side of things that's like,</v>

476
00:14:00.890 --> 00:14:01.940
<v Speaker 1>they have no sense of humor,</v>

477
00:14:02.210 --> 00:14:02.840
<v Speaker 1>no sensor,</v>

478
00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:04.370
<v Speaker 1>like almost academic in,</v>

479
00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:06.020
<v Speaker 1>it's all energy.</v>

480
00:14:06.021 --> 00:14:06.860
<v Speaker 1>It's all love.</v>

481
00:14:06.861 --> 00:14:07.461
<v Speaker 1>It's all light.</v>

482
00:14:07.461 --> 00:14:09.650
<v Speaker 1>And then someone fucking snatches their purse and they're like,</v>

483
00:14:09.770 --> 00:14:10.760
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

484
00:14:10.970 --> 00:14:12.420
<v Speaker 1>there's something wrong with the,</v>

485
00:14:12.421 --> 00:14:12.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

486
00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:14.300
<v Speaker 1>like protect your shit.</v>

487
00:14:14.570 --> 00:14:14.811
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

488
00:14:14.811 --> 00:14:16.490
<v Speaker 1>like both sides are applicable.</v>

489
00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:19.970
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's where people are flawed and they're so vigilant about</v>

490
00:14:19.971 --> 00:14:21.470
<v Speaker 1>protecting their little niche.</v>

491
00:14:21.471 --> 00:14:21.681
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

492
00:14:21.681 --> 00:14:22.730
<v Speaker 1>my shit is right.</v>

493
00:14:22.731 --> 00:14:23.980
<v Speaker 1>I'll pound you if you drift,</v>

494
00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:24.660
<v Speaker 1>you're wrong.</v>

495
00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:26.280
<v Speaker 1>And if you believe something else and the other people are like,</v>

496
00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:27.890
<v Speaker 1>you're just an ignorant ape,</v>

497
00:14:28.070 --> 00:14:28.401
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

498
00:14:28.401 --> 00:14:31.670
<v Speaker 1>on the other side of things and no one wants to kind of bridge that gap.</v>

499
00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:33.860
<v Speaker 1>But our birthright is to have all of it.</v>

500
00:14:33.890 --> 00:14:37.580
<v Speaker 1>And that's what we should strive for is complete balance in both of those</v>

501
00:14:37.581 --> 00:14:38.001
<v Speaker 1>aspects.</v>

502
00:14:38.001 --> 00:14:38.570
<v Speaker 1>And I think,</v>

503
00:14:38.570 --> 00:14:39.890
<v Speaker 1>I'm hoping that's why,</v>

504
00:14:40.070 --> 00:14:40.281
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

505
00:14:40.281 --> 00:14:44.090
<v Speaker 1>some people will listen to kind of what I'm saying is because I tried it,</v>

506
00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:45.380
<v Speaker 1>I tried to be able to do that.</v>

507
00:14:45.381 --> 00:14:48.500
<v Speaker 1>Like I want to kick ass in business and still talk to people about,</v>

508
00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:49.170
<v Speaker 1>yeah dude,</v>

509
00:14:49.170 --> 00:14:51.980
<v Speaker 1>like I went to another dimension and it was crazy,</v>

510
00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:53.060
<v Speaker 1>but I'm over here.</v>

511
00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:54.530
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be killing it,</v>

512
00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:54.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

513
00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:55.820
<v Speaker 1>in your world too.</v>

514
00:14:55.850 --> 00:14:57.410
<v Speaker 1>So don't think I'm slipping,</v>

515
00:14:57.590 --> 00:14:58.240
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

516
00:14:58.240 --> 00:14:59.660
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm trying to do.</v>

517
00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:00.520
<v Speaker 1>And that's my goal.</v>

518
00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:02.440
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people want to,</v>

519
00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:03.313
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

520
00:15:03.790 --> 00:15:08.020
<v Speaker 3>push aside or deny the importance of the physical world,</v>

521
00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:08.980
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

522
00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:09.400
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

523
00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:13.870
<v Speaker 3>whether it's capitalistic gains or whether it's keeping your body fit and</v>

524
00:15:13.871 --> 00:15:15.010
<v Speaker 3>sexually attractive.</v>

525
00:15:15.190 --> 00:15:18.940
<v Speaker 3>They want to deny the significance and importance of these things.</v>

526
00:15:19.150 --> 00:15:19.721
<v Speaker 3>And the,</v>

527
00:15:19.721 --> 00:15:20.141
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

528
00:15:20.141 --> 00:15:25.141
<v Speaker 3>the meaning of these things almost as like a form of socialism because they</v>

529
00:15:26.531 --> 00:15:30.820
<v Speaker 3>don't want to compete and they don't want to have to be sexually attractive.</v>

530
00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:32.110
<v Speaker 3>And so women will say,</v>

531
00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:32.500
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

532
00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:33.550
<v Speaker 3>is that what you care about?</v>

533
00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:33.701
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

534
00:15:33.701 --> 00:15:34.540
<v Speaker 3>you're shallow.</v>

535
00:15:34.541 --> 00:15:35.680
<v Speaker 3>You care about what someone looks like,</v>

536
00:15:35.890 --> 00:15:36.490
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

537
00:15:36.490 --> 00:15:37.750
<v Speaker 3>I'm a human being.</v>

538
00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:38.770
<v Speaker 3>I'm a human being.</v>

539
00:15:38.771 --> 00:15:39.700
<v Speaker 3>And if you're fat,</v>

540
00:15:39.701 --> 00:15:40.534
<v Speaker 3>that's gross.</v>

541
00:15:40.690 --> 00:15:41.111
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

542
00:15:41.111 --> 00:15:42.250
<v Speaker 3>That's just the way it is.</v>

543
00:15:42.340 --> 00:15:43.930
<v Speaker 3>And you can pretend all you want and you know,</v>

544
00:15:43.931 --> 00:15:46.150
<v Speaker 3>maybe you'll take fat with a grace personality,</v>

545
00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:46.691
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

546
00:15:46.691 --> 00:15:47.650
<v Speaker 3>over skinny.</v>

547
00:15:47.651 --> 00:15:48.484
<v Speaker 3>That's a con.</v>

548
00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:48.851
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

549
00:15:48.851 --> 00:15:50.560
<v Speaker 3>Maybe to make some compromises and you know,</v>

550
00:15:50.561 --> 00:15:51.730
<v Speaker 3>no one's perfect physically,</v>

551
00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:55.450
<v Speaker 3>but let's be honest about what we're looking at and what you like and why you</v>

552
00:15:55.451 --> 00:15:56.140
<v Speaker 3>like it.</v>

553
00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:58.390
<v Speaker 3>And that goes with capitalism as well.</v>

554
00:15:58.510 --> 00:16:01.150
<v Speaker 3>That goes with being a successful person.</v>

555
00:16:01.330 --> 00:16:01.721
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

556
00:16:01.721 --> 00:16:03.130
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of people that think that some,</v>

557
00:16:03.131 --> 00:16:07.480
<v Speaker 3>there's some things shallow about being monetarily successful and I think that's</v>

558
00:16:07.750 --> 00:16:10.090
<v Speaker 3>a form of socialistic thinking as well.</v>

559
00:16:10.091 --> 00:16:15.010
<v Speaker 3>It's like you want this to be a level playing field because you can't compete.</v>

560
00:16:15.190 --> 00:16:16.420
<v Speaker 3>And that's really what it is,</v>

561
00:16:16.630 --> 00:16:17.021
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

562
00:16:17.021 --> 00:16:19.480
<v Speaker 3>And you've got to find your fucking place in the Sun Jack Ass.</v>

563
00:16:19.690 --> 00:16:21.350
<v Speaker 3>And you know some people I will,</v>

564
00:16:21.351 --> 00:16:23.320
<v Speaker 3>I will never be playing professional basketball.</v>

565
00:16:23.321 --> 00:16:25.780
<v Speaker 3>I'm five foot eight and I don't run that good and it's just a fucking,</v>

566
00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:28.540
<v Speaker 3>just the way of the world band and they ain't a fair world.</v>

567
00:16:28.570 --> 00:16:29.230
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>

568
00:16:29.230 --> 00:16:30.490
<v Speaker 3>You got your own hand.</v>

569
00:16:30.610 --> 00:16:31.660
<v Speaker 3>This is your journey.</v>

570
00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:33.720
<v Speaker 3>You deal with the hand that you're given and,</v>

571
00:16:33.721 --> 00:16:33.940
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

572
00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:35.920
<v Speaker 3>and just find your fucking place.</v>

573
00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:38.950
<v Speaker 3>But don't try to hold other people back.</v>

574
00:16:39.070 --> 00:16:42.190
<v Speaker 3>Don't try to say there's something wrong with that girl being sexy as fuck.</v>

575
00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:43.840
<v Speaker 3>Don't think there's something wrong.</v>

576
00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:47.170
<v Speaker 3>But because that guy's got a six pack that makes girls wet,</v>

577
00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:48.640
<v Speaker 3>you know when they see him,</v>

578
00:16:48.641 --> 00:16:50.110

00:16:53.471 --> 00:16:54.970
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure he's really interesting to talk to him.</v>

583
00:16:55.090 --> 00:16:56.050
<v Speaker 3>Maybe he is.</v>

584
00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:57.400
<v Speaker 3>Maybe he's more interesting than you.</v>

585
00:16:57.401 --> 00:16:58.600
<v Speaker 3>Stupid because guess what?</v>

<v Speaker 3>It only takes like an hour a day to work out.</v>

587
00:17:00.431 --> 00:17:02.830
<v Speaker 3>You're telling me that all those other hours of the day he has to be doing</v>

588
00:17:02.831 --> 00:17:03.780

<v Speaker 3>you just want to pull the playing field down.</v>

594
00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:11.990
<v Speaker 3>You're not trying to level things now.</v>

595
00:17:11.991 --> 00:17:13.330
<v Speaker 3>You're not trying to rise.</v>

596
00:17:13.450 --> 00:17:14.140
<v Speaker 3>You're trying to,</v>

00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:27.100
<v Speaker 3>How about that?</v>

606
00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:30.700
<v Speaker 3>Remember that when you hear whiny conti,</v>

607
00:17:30.701 --> 00:17:31.181
<v Speaker 3>negative,</v>

00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:36.890
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

613
00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:37.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

614
00:17:37.340 --> 00:17:38.000
<v Speaker 1>It's uh,</v>

615
00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:38.331
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

616
00:17:38.331 --> 00:17:40.560
<v Speaker 1>I think back a long time ago,</v>

617
00:17:40.561 --> 00:17:43.130
<v Speaker 1>and I think we've touched on this maybe on the last podcast,</v>

618
00:17:43.131 --> 00:17:43.881
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

619
00:17:43.881 --> 00:17:46.520
<v Speaker 1>you had to go to war and in some countries you still do.</v>

620
00:17:46.521 --> 00:17:48.650
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's why that Israeli dude was so cool.</v>

621
00:17:48.651 --> 00:17:51.180
<v Speaker 1>Like everybody in Israel goes to war and he was like,</v>

622
00:17:51.181 --> 00:17:51.690
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

623
00:17:51.690 --> 00:17:53.940
<v Speaker 1>the kids are a little unruly or whatever.</v>

624
00:17:54.030 --> 00:17:54.630
<v Speaker 1>But when you,</v>

625
00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:55.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

626
00:17:55.050 --> 00:17:56.520
<v Speaker 1>but the parents don't care because they know,</v>

627
00:17:56.521 --> 00:17:58.410
<v Speaker 1>you know what 19 you're going to war.</v>

628
00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:00.150
<v Speaker 1>Like Israeli army is active.</v>

629
00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:01.073
<v Speaker 1>It's very active.</v>

630
00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:01.830
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't rest,</v>

631
00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:02.400
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

632
00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:05.700
<v Speaker 1>So that's one kind of last people that's holding,</v>

633
00:18:05.701 --> 00:18:08.670
<v Speaker 1>but still they're fighting with lasers and a lot of things.</v>

634
00:18:08.671 --> 00:18:08.881
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

635
00:18:08.881 --> 00:18:09.451
<v Speaker 1>not this guy,</v>

636
00:18:09.451 --> 00:18:10.284
<v Speaker 1>he was running it,</v>

637
00:18:10.330 --> 00:18:13.330
<v Speaker 3>fighting with shit that we give them trippy situation.</v>

638
00:18:13.331 --> 00:18:16.270
<v Speaker 3>Now there are about the size of Rhode Island and they're surrounded by no hate</v>

639
00:18:16.271 --> 00:18:16.630
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

640
00:18:16.630 --> 00:18:17.110
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

641
00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:20.050
<v Speaker 3>So countries all over the place to hate them and some of them have nuclear</v>

642
00:18:20.051 --> 00:18:20.884
<v Speaker 3>weapons.</v>

643
00:18:20.970 --> 00:18:21.280
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

644
00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:22.410
<v Speaker 3>But the fact that each one</v>

645
00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:24.450
<v Speaker 1>one has to be a warrior at some point,</v>

646
00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:24.991
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

647
00:18:24.991 --> 00:18:25.824
<v Speaker 1>I think it,</v>

648
00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:26.610
<v Speaker 1>it impacts,</v>

649
00:18:26.610 --> 00:18:27.361
<v Speaker 1>there's more character.</v>

650
00:18:27.361 --> 00:18:27.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

651
00:18:27.630 --> 00:18:28.351
<v Speaker 1>Impacts the culture.</v>

652
00:18:28.351 --> 00:18:30.240
<v Speaker 1>And that's the way it used to be back in the Roman days,</v>

653
00:18:30.241 --> 00:18:30.451
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

654
00:18:30.451 --> 00:18:30.720
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

655
00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:31.560
<v Speaker 1>every philosopher,</v>

656
00:18:31.561 --> 00:18:32.250
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>

657
00:18:32.250 --> 00:18:33.750
<v Speaker 1>Socrates was a bad ass.</v>

658
00:18:33.751 --> 00:18:34.020
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

659
00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:35.340
<v Speaker 1>every philosopher had to be,</v>

660
00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:39.960
<v Speaker 1>they ran campaigns with swords and stab barbarians in the throat and then talk</v>

661
00:18:39.961 --> 00:18:42.030
<v Speaker 1>philosophy over some wine later.</v>

662
00:18:42.031 --> 00:18:42.864
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

663
00:18:42.990 --> 00:18:45.390
<v Speaker 1>that aspect is largely ignored,</v>

664
00:18:45.391 --> 00:18:45.811
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

665
00:18:45.811 --> 00:18:46.100
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

666
00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:46.933
<v Speaker 1>and one of the,</v>

667
00:18:47.610 --> 00:18:48.450
<v Speaker 1>one of the large,</v>

668
00:18:48.730 --> 00:18:49.230
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

669
00:18:49.230 --> 00:18:51.450
<v Speaker 1>sicknesses I think of our world is they are,</v>

670
00:18:51.451 --> 00:18:51.930
<v Speaker 1>like you said.</v>

671
00:18:51.930 --> 00:18:52.011
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

672
00:18:52.011 --> 00:18:53.490
<v Speaker 3>we definitely talked about this before,</v>

673
00:18:53.491 --> 00:18:55.380
<v Speaker 3>the coming of age ceremony.</v>

674
00:18:55.410 --> 00:18:55.601
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>

675
00:18:55.601 --> 00:18:55.980
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

676
00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:56.191
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

677
00:18:56.191 --> 00:18:58.110
<v Speaker 3>the ritualistic aspect of,</v>

678
00:18:58.111 --> 00:18:58.351
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

679
00:18:58.351 --> 00:19:02.550
<v Speaker 3>making a big deal of coming of age because I think that's something that's</v>

680
00:19:02.551 --> 00:19:03.630
<v Speaker 3>missing from this world.</v>

681
00:19:03.650 --> 00:19:04.860
<v Speaker 3>Cause I think that kids today,</v>

682
00:19:04.861 --> 00:19:06.300
<v Speaker 3>like they don't know when they're a man,</v>

683
00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:07.021

689
00:19:11.971 --> 00:19:12.780

690
00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:13.613

00:19:17.850 --> 00:19:18.300
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

696
00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:18.990
<v Speaker 3>cultures,</v>

697
00:19:18.990 --> 00:19:20.700
<v Speaker 3>there's a ceremony,</v>

698
00:19:20.950 --> 00:19:21.241
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

699
00:19:21.241 --> 00:19:21.841

00:19:22.051 --> 00:19:25.080
<v Speaker 3>the guys in the Amazon that do that bullet ant glove.</v>

702
00:19:25.770 --> 00:19:25.921
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

703
00:19:25.921 --> 00:19:27.030
<v Speaker 3>we saw that tree by the way.</v>

00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:31.650
<v Speaker 3>Fuck Outta here.</v>

705
00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:33.420
<v Speaker 3>It's an ant that bite you,</v>

706
00:19:33.421 --> 00:19:34.171
<v Speaker 3>it stings you.</v>

707
00:19:34.171 --> 00:19:39.171
<v Speaker 3>And it feels like your arm is being slammed in a car door for 24 hours</v>

708
00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:41.970
<v Speaker 3>apparently is blinding,</v>

709
00:19:42.030 --> 00:19:43.620
<v Speaker 3>unbearable pain.</v>

710
00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:45.690
<v Speaker 3>And for the coming of age ceremony,</v>

711
00:19:45.691 --> 00:19:49.920
<v Speaker 3>these crazy motherfuckers take these ants and they give these oven mitts and</v>

712
00:19:49.921 --> 00:19:50.051
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

713
00:19:50.051 --> 00:19:50.231
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

714
00:19:50.231 --> 00:19:52.020
<v Speaker 3>they make them themselves and these,</v>

715
00:19:52.021 --> 00:19:55.740
<v Speaker 3>they're all poorest and they stuffed the ants in there so the ants can't go</v>

716
00:19:55.741 --> 00:19:56.490
<v Speaker 3>anywhere.</v>

717
00:19:56.490 --> 00:20:01.490
<v Speaker 3>And you have to shove your hands into these gloves filled with bullet ants and</v>

718
00:20:01.531 --> 00:20:03.030
<v Speaker 3>mother fucker.</v>

719
00:20:03.031 --> 00:20:03.990

720
00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:09.210
<v Speaker 3>That tears just streaming down these men's faces as they were going through the</v>

721
00:20:09.211 --> 00:20:10.044
<v Speaker 3>ceremony.</v>

722
00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:11.490
<v Speaker 3>Will you get through that?</v>

723
00:20:11.491 --> 00:20:11.970
<v Speaker 3>Man,</v>

724
00:20:11.970 --> 00:20:13.920
<v Speaker 3>you have the right to say you're a man now.</v>

725
00:20:14.190 --> 00:20:14.821
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying?</v>

726
00:20:14.821 --> 00:20:19.821
<v Speaker 3>Like you feel like this is a very clear boundary of broken through and you know,</v>

727
00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:23.230
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't suggest bullet ants.</v>

728
00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:26.213
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

729
00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:28.680
<v Speaker 3>well look at what happened to Ari,</v>

00:20:30.181 --> 00:20:30.671
<v Speaker 3>and a little bit,</v>

733
00:20:30.671 --> 00:20:31.460
<v Speaker 3>but think about it.</v>

734
00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:32.250
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

735
00:20:32.250 --> 00:20:33.410

736
00:20:33.940 --> 00:20:34.330
<v Speaker 3>home of</v>

737

<v Speaker 1>Like whether it's bullet answer,</v>

777
00:21:21.551 --> 00:21:25.000
<v Speaker 1>bring a bipartisan group to a campfire where they all do mushrooms.</v>

786
00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:45.720
<v Speaker 3>imagine how different it would be if they had to go through bootcamp.</v>

787
00:21:46.020 --> 00:21:50.850
<v Speaker 3>Just that go through some something that shows your character other than the</v>

810
00:22:30.990 --> 00:22:31.950
<v Speaker 1>they're allowed to do that though.</v>

811
00:22:31.951 --> 00:22:32.731
<v Speaker 1>Just because they're,</v>

812
00:22:32.731 --> 00:22:33.930
<v Speaker 1>they have their job.</v>

813
00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:35.520
<v Speaker 1>They're not allowed to do that on their off time.</v>

814
00:22:35.521 --> 00:22:36.250
<v Speaker 1>There's still men</v>

815
00:22:36.250 --> 00:22:40.390
<v Speaker 3>because they pretending they're someone else because they pretend to be family.</v>

816
00:22:40.391 --> 00:22:45.391
<v Speaker 3>Men with great Christian values and loyal to their wive and their vows.</v>

817
00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:46.301
<v Speaker 3>But meanwhile,</v>

818
00:22:46.301 --> 00:22:48.610
<v Speaker 3>they're sending cock pictures all over the fucking Internet.</v>

819
00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:51.610
<v Speaker 3>And so you know that this is a person who's full of Shit.</v>

820
00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:53.890
<v Speaker 3>And this is a person who can't be trusted.</v>

821
00:22:53.891 --> 00:22:57.700
<v Speaker 3>His character can't be trusted because he's pretending to be something he's not.</v>

822
00:22:57.850 --> 00:23:01.000
<v Speaker 3>It's not like Tommy Lee sending pictures of his Dick and you're like,</v>

823
00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:01.451
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

824
00:23:01.451 --> 00:23:02.284
<v Speaker 3>Tommy,</v>

825
00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:03.100
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

826
00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:04.060
<v Speaker 3>it's fucking Tommy Lee.</v>

827
00:23:04.061 --> 00:23:04.960
<v Speaker 3>He's crazy.</v>

828
00:23:04.961 --> 00:23:06.550
<v Speaker 3>He's married to Pamela Anderson.</v>

829
00:23:06.551 --> 00:23:07.660
<v Speaker 3>We've all seen his dick.</v>

830
00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:08.673
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying?</v>

831
00:23:08.770 --> 00:23:11.220
<v Speaker 3>It's like if Tommy Lee was sending pictures of his Dick to girls,</v>

832
00:23:11.221 --> 00:23:11.651
<v Speaker 3>he'd be like,</v>

833
00:23:11.651 --> 00:23:12.100
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

834
00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:13.070
<v Speaker 3>my Dick look like that.</v>

835
00:23:13.071 --> 00:23:13.380
<v Speaker 3>I missed that.</v>

836
00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:14.260
<v Speaker 3>It fixes of it though.</v>

837
00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:15.640
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

838
00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:16.750
<v Speaker 3>it's not like that.</v>

839
00:23:16.751 --> 00:23:18.820
<v Speaker 3>When someone pretends to be something they're not,</v>

840
00:23:18.821 --> 00:23:19.840
<v Speaker 3>and we know they're not,</v>

841
00:23:19.841 --> 00:23:20.800
<v Speaker 3>we know that there.</v>

842
00:23:20.950 --> 00:23:21.940
<v Speaker 3>There's no way.</v>

843
00:23:22.030 --> 00:23:24.670
<v Speaker 3>Most politicians can really be the way they are.</v>

844
00:23:24.750 --> 00:23:28.240
<v Speaker 3>You remember how John Edwards used to pretend he was until we found out he was</v>

845
00:23:28.241 --> 00:23:32.350
<v Speaker 3>banging some other chick while his wife was dying of cancer and apparently</v>

846
00:23:32.351 --> 00:23:34.870
<v Speaker 3>fucking physically threatened her and you know,</v>

847
00:23:35.170 --> 00:23:36.010
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

848
00:23:36.020 --> 00:23:40.630
<v Speaker 3>he's a fucking use campaign funds to hide the fact that he was banging this</v>

849
00:23:40.631 --> 00:23:41.260
<v Speaker 3>broad.</v>

850
00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:43.090
<v Speaker 3>So now he's probably going to go to jail.</v>

851
00:23:43.091 --> 00:23:43.470
<v Speaker 3>This is there.</v>

852
00:23:43.470 --> 00:23:45.040
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking going after John Edwards.</v>

853
00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:46.430
<v Speaker 3>But at one point in time,</v>

854
00:23:46.431 --> 00:23:51.431
<v Speaker 3>John Edwards was this lawyer with good old fashion American values and pull them</v>

855
00:23:51.951 --> 00:23:53.480
<v Speaker 3>up by your bootstraps,</v>

856
00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:54.050
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

857
00:23:54.050 --> 00:23:56.060
<v Speaker 3>work ethic and you know,</v>

858
00:23:56.100 --> 00:23:56.230
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

859
00:23:56.230 --> 00:23:56.421
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

860
00:23:56.421 --> 00:23:56.641
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

861
00:23:56.641 --> 00:23:56.821
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

862
00:23:56.821 --> 00:24:01.790
<v Speaker 3>you'd come to find out that it is impossible to be a pure person,</v>

863
00:24:02.330 --> 00:24:04.970
<v Speaker 3>to be the guy that you're pretending to be,</v>

864
00:24:04.971 --> 00:24:06.410
<v Speaker 3>to be a politician.</v>

865
00:24:06.710 --> 00:24:11.450
<v Speaker 3>They push it back so far that eventually it pops out somewhere.</v>

866
00:24:11.630 --> 00:24:15.860
<v Speaker 3>It blows out there dressing up like a tiger and taking pictures or Al Gore</v>

867
00:24:15.950 --> 00:24:18.860
<v Speaker 3>fucking tries to get his dick sucked while he's getting a massage and the chick</v>

868
00:24:18.861 --> 00:24:19.630
<v Speaker 3>wants a sec,</v>

869
00:24:19.630 --> 00:24:19.910
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

870
00:24:19.910 --> 00:24:21.440
<v Speaker 3>charge them with sexual assault.</v>

871
00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:22.461
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

872
00:24:22.461 --> 00:24:23.240
<v Speaker 3>there's some truth.</v>

873
00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:24.020
<v Speaker 3>There's something,</v>

874
00:24:24.020 --> 00:24:25.130
<v Speaker 3>something happened there.</v>

875
00:24:25.340 --> 00:24:25.731
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

876
00:24:25.731 --> 00:24:26.660
<v Speaker 3>something happened there.</v>

877
00:24:26.690 --> 00:24:27.860
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what it was.</v>

878
00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:30.110
<v Speaker 3>She might have overblown it.</v>

879
00:24:30.230 --> 00:24:34.180
<v Speaker 3>He might've just rubbed his cock honor just as like a little tester.</v>

880
00:24:34.190 --> 00:24:35.570
<v Speaker 3>Who knows what the fuck happened.</v>

881
00:24:35.660 --> 00:24:36.800
<v Speaker 3>But whatever happened,</v>

882
00:24:36.890 --> 00:24:38.630
<v Speaker 3>it's not what we thought Al Gore was.</v>

883
00:24:38.900 --> 00:24:41.960
<v Speaker 3>We didn't think Al Gore was whipping his dick out and fucking hotels was getting</v>

884
00:24:41.961 --> 00:24:42.794
<v Speaker 3>massaged.</v>

885
00:24:42.890 --> 00:24:43.790
<v Speaker 3>We didn't think that was,</v>

886
00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:45.590
<v Speaker 3>he was pulling girls on top of them.</v>

887
00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:46.970
<v Speaker 3>We didn't think that was Al Gore.</v>

888
00:24:46.971 --> 00:24:47.900
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if he did that,</v>

889
00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:51.830
<v Speaker 3>but he did enough or got into a situation that was enough for him to get in</v>

890
00:24:51.831 --> 00:24:52.664
<v Speaker 3>trouble.</v>

891
00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:53.160
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

892
00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:53.391
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

893
00:24:53.391 --> 00:24:57.700
<v Speaker 3>no one talks about what Winston Churchill did with his women like that.</v>

894
00:24:57.730 --> 00:24:58.311
<v Speaker 3>That was like,</v>

895
00:24:58.311 --> 00:24:59.360
<v Speaker 3>it didn't fucking matter.</v>

896
00:24:59.660 --> 00:25:00.530
<v Speaker 3>Fighting the Nazis.</v>

897
00:25:00.531 --> 00:25:01.460
<v Speaker 3>He was kicking ass.</v>

898
00:25:01.670 --> 00:25:03.020
<v Speaker 3>And I think all our politicians now,</v>

899
00:25:03.021 --> 00:25:04.010
<v Speaker 3>they're so fraudulent.</v>

900
00:25:04.011 --> 00:25:07.160
<v Speaker 3>And what their kind of projecting that it does matter at this point.</v>

901
00:25:07.161 --> 00:25:10.070
<v Speaker 3>It's like you're a hypocritical lying little bastard.</v>

902
00:25:11.090 --> 00:25:12.050
<v Speaker 3>But if they were real,</v>

903
00:25:12.051 --> 00:25:16.010
<v Speaker 3>like really doing shit and very honest with what they're attacking and the</v>

904
00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:19.220
<v Speaker 3>issues they were attacking were honest and they were coming from a real place.</v>

905
00:25:19.450 --> 00:25:20.120
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

906
00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:20.661
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah,</v>

907
00:25:20.661 --> 00:25:23.030
<v Speaker 3>our fucking fearless leader after a big,</v>

908
00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:23.660
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

909
00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:24.351
<v Speaker 3>a tough night.</v>

910
00:25:24.351 --> 00:25:25.000
<v Speaker 3>He had some,</v>

911
00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:25.640
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

912
00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:26.720
<v Speaker 3>sexual indiscretion,</v>

913
00:25:26.721 --> 00:25:27.350
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>

914
00:25:27.350 --> 00:25:28.370
<v Speaker 3>you forgive that stuff.</v>

915
00:25:28.371 --> 00:25:31.070
<v Speaker 3>But when they build this foundation full of,</v>

916
00:25:31.350 --> 00:25:32.060
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

917
00:25:32.060 --> 00:25:34.010
<v Speaker 3>puritanical nonsense,</v>

918
00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:34.850
<v Speaker 3>then they do that.</v>

919
00:25:34.850 --> 00:25:36.560
<v Speaker 3>They feel like that's the only way to get elected though.</v>

920
00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:41.860
<v Speaker 3>And there's so much power in bullshit today with the idea of the Christian</v>

921
00:25:41.961 --> 00:25:43.070
<v Speaker 3>ideology and the,</v>

922
00:25:43.071 --> 00:25:43.311
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

923
00:25:43.311 --> 00:25:43.851
<v Speaker 3>the Christian,</v>

924
00:25:43.851 --> 00:25:44.210
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

925
00:25:44.210 --> 00:25:45.560
<v Speaker 3>And the fucking,</v>

926
00:25:45.620 --> 00:25:46.160
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

927
00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:49.090
<v Speaker 3>so Uber judgmental and that,</v>

928
00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:49.993
<v Speaker 3>that there's,</v>

929
00:25:50.580 --> 00:25:54.230
<v Speaker 3>that's a big political push because those people were organized.</v>

930
00:25:54.410 --> 00:25:54.860
<v Speaker 3>Those,</v>

931
00:25:54.860 --> 00:25:55.320
<v Speaker 3>those,</v>

932
00:25:55.320 --> 00:26:00.320
<v Speaker 3>the really right wing Christian fundamentalists that,</v>

933
00:26:00.471 --> 00:26:01.304
<v Speaker 3>that movement,</v>

934
00:26:01.310 --> 00:26:02.990
<v Speaker 3>that's a very organized movement.</v>

935
00:26:03.170 --> 00:26:04.370
<v Speaker 3>And if they're on your side,</v>

936
00:26:04.371 --> 00:26:05.690
<v Speaker 3>you can do a lot of damage.</v>

937
00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:06.950
<v Speaker 3>And if they're against you,</v>

938
00:26:06.951 --> 00:26:07.910
<v Speaker 3>it can really hurt.</v>

939
00:26:08.090 --> 00:26:08.540
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

940
00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:11.750
<v Speaker 3>if they do organize the churches and they all said pull out and they say,</v>

941
00:26:11.751 --> 00:26:11.901
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

942
00:26:11.901 --> 00:26:12.321
<v Speaker 3>this is fucking,</v>

943
00:26:12.321 --> 00:26:13.970
<v Speaker 3>Al Gore doesn't believe in Jesus.</v>

944
00:26:14.210 --> 00:26:15.110
<v Speaker 3>Oh fuck him.</v>

945
00:26:15.350 --> 00:26:15.651
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

946
00:26:15.651 --> 00:26:16.470
<v Speaker 3>they'll go crazy.</v>

947
00:26:16.470 --> 00:26:19.280
<v Speaker 3>You have to fake that you believe in Jesus,</v>

948
00:26:19.430 --> 00:26:20.750
<v Speaker 3>whether you do or not,</v>

949
00:26:20.751 --> 00:26:23.160
<v Speaker 3>you better say you do because you're,</v>

950
00:26:23.161 --> 00:26:24.290
<v Speaker 3>if you say you don't,</v>

951
00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:26.870
<v Speaker 3>you're going to piss off 50 fucking percent of the country and you're never</v>

952
00:26:26.871 --> 00:26:27.920
<v Speaker 3>gonna get anything done.</v>

953
00:26:28.060 --> 00:26:28.710
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

954
00:26:28.710 --> 00:26:29.480
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

955
00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:30.291
<v Speaker 3>Fuck situation.</v>

956
00:26:30.291 --> 00:26:31.310
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's why,</v>

957
00:26:31.750 --> 00:26:32.410
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

958
00:26:32.410 --> 00:26:36.770
<v Speaker 3>there's the shamans down there when they talk about 2012 they talk about it just</v>

959
00:26:36.771 --> 00:26:37.610
<v Speaker 3>as a tipping point.</v>

960
00:26:37.820 --> 00:26:38.321
<v Speaker 3>But that,</v>

961
00:26:38.321 --> 00:26:38.810
<v Speaker 3>that's like,</v>

962
00:26:38.810 --> 00:26:39.111
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

963
00:26:39.111 --> 00:26:39.944
<v Speaker 3>they talked about it.</v>

964
00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:40.590
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

965
00:26:40.590 --> 00:26:43.040
<v Speaker 3>Well they said that 2012 is the tipping point.</v>

966
00:26:43.050 --> 00:26:43.980
<v Speaker 3>That's when the</v>

967
00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:46.170
<v Speaker 1>world has to start changing and it will,</v>

968
00:26:46.350 --> 00:26:46.621
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

969
00:26:46.621 --> 00:26:47.940
<v Speaker 1>upheavals will happen.</v>

970
00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:49.800
<v Speaker 1>They don't know if it's going to be economic.</v>

971
00:26:49.801 --> 00:26:51.090
<v Speaker 1>They don't know if it's going to be,</v>

972
00:26:51.220 --> 00:26:51.511
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

973
00:26:51.511 --> 00:26:51.901
<v Speaker 1>physical,</v>

974
00:26:51.901 --> 00:26:53.760
<v Speaker 1>it's not the end of time or anything like that.</v>

975
00:26:53.761 --> 00:26:54.480
<v Speaker 1>And that was,</v>

976
00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:56.210
<v Speaker 1>it was kind of cool to hear them talk about it.</v>

977
00:26:56.230 --> 00:26:57.480
<v Speaker 1>So like that's all nonsense.</v>

978
00:26:57.481 --> 00:26:58.314
<v Speaker 1>It's all hype.</v>

979
00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:02.260
<v Speaker 1>What it is is it's the point at which things must start changing for us.</v>

980
00:27:02.430 --> 00:27:03.660
<v Speaker 3>Why is there a date?</v>

981
00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:05.100
<v Speaker 3>Why is it,</v>

982
00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:07.740
<v Speaker 3>do I think it's December 21st,</v>

983
00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:09.120
<v Speaker 3>2012 or was it 2012 at all?</v>

984
00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:12.450
<v Speaker 1>It's to a astrological restaurant.</v>

985
00:27:12.451 --> 00:27:13.830
<v Speaker 1>Comical kind of event,</v>

986
00:27:13.831 --> 00:27:14.160
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

987
00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:15.150
<v Speaker 1>Isn't there some kind of</v>

988
00:27:15.330 --> 00:27:16.490
<v Speaker 3>the alignment I've heard,</v>

989
00:27:16.491 --> 00:27:16.790
<v Speaker 3>I didn't,</v>

990
00:27:16.790 --> 00:27:17.960
<v Speaker 3>obviously I'm not an astronomer,</v>

991
00:27:17.961 --> 00:27:21.680
<v Speaker 3>but I've heard Neil Tyson talk about how that's bullshit into that.</v>

992
00:27:21.681 --> 00:27:25.100
<v Speaker 3>That event happens all the time that everyone's talking about how it aligns with</v>

993
00:27:25.101 --> 00:27:28.130
<v Speaker 3>the center of the galaxy and he's like can always does to happens all the time.</v>

994
00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:28.420
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

995
00:27:28.420 --> 00:27:28.601
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

996
00:27:28.601 --> 00:27:29.231
<v Speaker 1>so I don't know.</v>

997
00:27:29.231 --> 00:27:30.910
<v Speaker 1>I don't exactly know how they got the date.</v>

998
00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:35.050
<v Speaker 1>I mean I think it was tied to some kind of of going on</v>

999
00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:35.680
<v Speaker 3>in this,</v>

1000
00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:36.041
<v Speaker 3>in the,</v>

1001
00:27:36.041 --> 00:27:38.530
<v Speaker 3>in the idea of astrology and astronomy,</v>

1002
00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:40.930
<v Speaker 3>there's so much going on where you know,</v>

1003
00:27:40.931 --> 00:27:45.250
<v Speaker 3>they can figure out that the moon is off a little bit with its gravity and then</v>

1004
00:27:45.251 --> 00:27:48.820
<v Speaker 3>they have to figure out what is responsible for this error and the moon's</v>

1005
00:27:48.821 --> 00:27:49.651
<v Speaker 3>gravity will,</v>

1006
00:27:49.651 --> 00:27:53.440
<v Speaker 3>it could be a brown dwarf star that lays,</v>

1007
00:27:53.441 --> 00:27:53.681
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1008
00:27:53.681 --> 00:27:55.870
<v Speaker 3>a hundred million miles outside of Pluto.</v>

1009
00:27:56.020 --> 00:27:57.950
<v Speaker 3>And that's like the current theory is in it.</v>

1010
00:27:58.120 --> 00:27:59.350
<v Speaker 3>But they can figure that out.</v>

1011
00:27:59.500 --> 00:28:00.191
<v Speaker 3>They can figure it out.</v>

1012
00:28:00.191 --> 00:28:04.450
<v Speaker 3>They couldn't measure gravity and know that there's errors in places and try to</v>

1013
00:28:04.451 --> 00:28:07.150
<v Speaker 3>like figure out what y where's this error coming from.</v>

1014
00:28:07.420 --> 00:28:12.420
<v Speaker 3>So we know that that for sure that the moon's effect and its particular gravity</v>

1015
00:28:12.731 --> 00:28:14.230
<v Speaker 3>has an effect on tides.</v>

1016
00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:17.110
<v Speaker 3>We believe it has an effect on human behavior,</v>

1017
00:28:17.111 --> 00:28:18.490
<v Speaker 3>although that's all subjective.</v>

1018
00:28:18.491 --> 00:28:19.580
<v Speaker 3>But we,</v>

1019
00:28:19.710 --> 00:28:22.480
<v Speaker 3>we know that these little bodies or these,</v>

1020
00:28:22.481 --> 00:28:22.721
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>

1021
00:28:22.721 --> 00:28:23.830
<v Speaker 3>these motions and these,</v>

1022
00:28:23.831 --> 00:28:28.390
<v Speaker 3>these things that we can't quite grab a hold of have a very physical effect on</v>

1023
00:28:28.391 --> 00:28:28.720
<v Speaker 3>the earth.</v>

1024
00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:32.770
<v Speaker 3>Like in the tide w who knows how many different things are doing that all the</v>

1025
00:28:32.771 --> 00:28:34.690
<v Speaker 3>time with the procession of the equinoxes,</v>

1026
00:28:34.870 --> 00:28:37.540
<v Speaker 3>the fact that the earth wobbles on its access,</v>

1027
00:28:37.670 --> 00:28:37.860
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1028
00:28:37.860 --> 00:28:39.850
<v Speaker 3>26,000 year cycle.</v>

1029
00:28:39.970 --> 00:28:41.350
<v Speaker 3>And in between that times,</v>

1030
00:28:41.470 --> 00:28:41.711
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1031
00:28:41.711 --> 00:28:44.050
<v Speaker 3>you never know what is aligned with what,</v>

1032
00:28:44.051 --> 00:28:48.640
<v Speaker 3>when you were brought into this world and that the idea behind astrology as</v>

1033
00:28:48.641 --> 00:28:51.940
<v Speaker 3>fucking flaky and new agey and bullshitty as it sounds,</v>

1034
00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:53.770
<v Speaker 3>is that these events,</v>

1035
00:28:53.771 --> 00:28:56.860
<v Speaker 3>these alignments of stars and positions of,</v>

1036
00:28:56.970 --> 00:28:58.750
<v Speaker 3>of the moon and all these different things,</v>

1037
00:28:58.930 --> 00:29:03.930
<v Speaker 3>they actually affect how a human being is charged as they're set loose from the</v>

1038
00:29:03.941 --> 00:29:05.650
<v Speaker 3>vagina into the world.</v>

1039
00:29:05.830 --> 00:29:06.041
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1040
00:29:06.041 --> 00:29:06.400
<v Speaker 3>that it,</v>

1041
00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:08.260
<v Speaker 3>that it actually has on it and it look,</v>

1042
00:29:08.261 --> 00:29:08.980
<v Speaker 3>it fucking,</v>

1043
00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:10.030
<v Speaker 3>I know a lot of Leos,</v>

1044
00:29:10.031 --> 00:29:11.200
<v Speaker 3>it seemed like Leo's,</v>

1045
00:29:11.550 --> 00:29:12.070
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1046
00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:14.010
<v Speaker 3>I know a lot of cancers that act like cancer.</v>

1047
00:29:14.050 --> 00:29:14.883
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1048
00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:18.760
<v Speaker 3>fuck it sounds like utter horse shit,</v>

1049
00:29:18.761 --> 00:29:20.740
<v Speaker 3>but God damn it's fucking clothes.</v>

1050
00:29:20.770 --> 00:29:21.603
<v Speaker 3>It seems,</v>

1051
00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:22.990
<v Speaker 3>it seems damn close.</v>

1052
00:29:23.090 --> 00:29:23.923
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1053
00:29:23.930 --> 00:29:24.471
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

1054
00:29:24.471 --> 00:29:24.741
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1055
00:29:24.741 --> 00:29:26.060
<v Speaker 1>I don't know exactly what the,</v>

1056
00:29:26.061 --> 00:29:26.480
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1057
00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:28.700
<v Speaker 1>what the event is that they named the date for.</v>

1058
00:29:28.701 --> 00:29:29.511
<v Speaker 1>They didn't go into that.</v>

1059
00:29:29.511 --> 00:29:32.750
<v Speaker 1>But what they said is that a new type of person has to emerge at that point and</v>

1060
00:29:32.751 --> 00:29:36.560
<v Speaker 1>that the old ways have to change and they will and that things will get fucked</v>

1061
00:29:36.561 --> 00:29:37.760
<v Speaker 1>up enough where they have to.</v>

1062
00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:38.331
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1063
00:29:38.331 --> 00:29:41.030
<v Speaker 1>it's not like we all got a rally and you,</v>

1064
00:29:41.350 --> 00:29:41.771
<v Speaker 1>but we do.</v>

1065
00:29:41.771 --> 00:29:43.060
<v Speaker 1>And when we do it to a certain degree,</v>

1066
00:29:43.061 --> 00:29:43.930
<v Speaker 1>we have to prepare for it,</v>

1067
00:29:43.931 --> 00:29:44.800
<v Speaker 1>but it'll,</v>

1068
00:29:44.801 --> 00:29:46.270
<v Speaker 1>it'll force itself to happen.</v>

1069
00:29:46.271 --> 00:29:48.880
<v Speaker 1>So we just need to be ready for it as what they're saying.</v>

1070
00:29:48.881 --> 00:29:52.450
<v Speaker 1>Like the new era is going to come and it's going to happen either complete</v>

1071
00:29:52.451 --> 00:29:53.710
<v Speaker 1>economic upheaval,</v>

1072
00:29:53.830 --> 00:29:55.360
<v Speaker 1>physical upheaval of the earth.</v>

1073
00:29:55.540 --> 00:29:55.781
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1074
00:29:55.781 --> 00:29:58.030
<v Speaker 1>whatever's going to happen is going to force our hand.</v>

1075
00:29:58.180 --> 00:29:59.950
<v Speaker 1>And then the new people are going to have to emerge.</v>

1076
00:29:59.951 --> 00:30:02.290
<v Speaker 1>They call it the legend of Catsa Quadel defense,</v>

1077
00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:03.191
<v Speaker 1>the feathered serpent.</v>

1078
00:30:03.191 --> 00:30:07.480
<v Speaker 1>But really that represents the new type of human that comes and starts taking a</v>

1079
00:30:07.481 --> 00:30:08.201
<v Speaker 1>leadership role.</v>

1080
00:30:08.201 --> 00:30:12.100
<v Speaker 1>So all of these cock picturing politicians and everything,</v>

1081
00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:15.670
<v Speaker 1>whatever they believe is going to happen is going to change that paradigm where</v>

1082
00:30:15.671 --> 00:30:20.110
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden that becomes deemphasized either faith in them gets lost,</v>

1083
00:30:20.111 --> 00:30:21.670
<v Speaker 1>a new system as to emerge.</v>

1084
00:30:21.790 --> 00:30:22.690
<v Speaker 1>New leaders,</v>

1085
00:30:22.870 --> 00:30:23.490
<v Speaker 1>new,</v>

1086
00:30:23.490 --> 00:30:23.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1087
00:30:23.750 --> 00:30:24.560
<v Speaker 1>political.</v>

1088
00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:24.930
<v Speaker 3>Is this,</v>

1089
00:30:24.930 --> 00:30:26.670
<v Speaker 3>the Shamans have actually explained this to you?</v>

1090
00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:27.240
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1091
00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:28.410
<v Speaker 3>Did they talk about the Internet?</v>

1092
00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:30.573
<v Speaker 1>Are they on Twitter?</v>

1093
00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:32.393
<v Speaker 1>How come on,</v>

1094
00:30:33.990 --> 00:30:34.823
<v Speaker 1>you can tell,</v>

1095
00:30:35.050 --> 00:30:37.630
<v Speaker 1>you can tell the mountain the mountain shamans are dim at different than the</v>

1096
00:30:37.631 --> 00:30:38.261
<v Speaker 1>jungle shamans.</v>

1097
00:30:38.261 --> 00:30:42.100
<v Speaker 1>But you can tell a good mountain Sharman by how much he smells like burnt Lama</v>

1098
00:30:42.100 --> 00:30:44.380
<v Speaker 1>Shit because that's how they stay warm up in the high parts.</v>

1099
00:30:44.381 --> 00:30:46.360
<v Speaker 1>So it'd be really be really,</v>

1100
00:30:46.361 --> 00:30:46.610
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1101
00:30:46.610 --> 00:30:48.430
<v Speaker 1>it really smells like burnt Lama Shit.</v>

1102
00:30:48.431 --> 00:30:48.671
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1103
00:30:48.671 --> 00:30:52.310
<v Speaker 1>he's probably authentic cause then he's up up above 15,000 feet for most of</v>

1104
00:30:52.311 --> 00:30:52.630
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

1105
00:30:52.630 --> 00:30:53.411
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ,</v>

1106
00:30:53.411 --> 00:30:54.700
<v Speaker 3>but no cell phone,</v>

1107
00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:55.720
<v Speaker 3>no Internet.</v>

1108
00:30:55.721 --> 00:30:58.030
<v Speaker 3>And he's missing the cool youtube videos.</v>

1109
00:30:58.620 --> 00:30:59.490
<v Speaker 1>Some one of them,</v>

1110
00:30:59.491 --> 00:31:00.570
<v Speaker 1>one of the guys that had,</v>

1111
00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:01.110
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1112
00:31:01.110 --> 00:31:02.160
<v Speaker 1>I was talking with,</v>

1113
00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:02.871
<v Speaker 1>had a,</v>

1114
00:31:02.871 --> 00:31:05.990
<v Speaker 1>at a full URL at the bottom of his little corner.</v>

1115
00:31:06.020 --> 00:31:07.410
<v Speaker 1>So they're starting to adapt to it.</v>

1116
00:31:07.770 --> 00:31:08.460
<v Speaker 3>Nice seeing you.</v>

1117
00:31:08.460 --> 00:31:09.181
<v Speaker 3>They need that.</v>

1118
00:31:09.181 --> 00:31:09.600
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>

1119
00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:09.931
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1120
00:31:09.931 --> 00:31:12.120
<v Speaker 3>people poo poo the cultural experience,</v>

1121
00:31:12.121 --> 00:31:12.391
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1122
00:31:12.391 --> 00:31:14.880
<v Speaker 3>because it's filled with morons and lady Gaga fans.</v>

1123
00:31:15.210 --> 00:31:16.620
<v Speaker 3>But there's nothing wrong with lady Gaga.</v>

1124
00:31:16.770 --> 00:31:17.011
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1125
00:31:17.011 --> 00:31:19.470
<v Speaker 3>That's part of the trip and I think she's fascinating.</v>

1126
00:31:19.471 --> 00:31:20.700
<v Speaker 3>I like some of her music.</v>

1127
00:31:20.701 --> 00:31:21.570
<v Speaker 3>How about that?</v>

1128
00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:24.570
<v Speaker 3>And there's nothing wrong with the rest of the cultural experiments.</v>

1129
00:31:24.571 --> 00:31:26.430
<v Speaker 3>Even the most ridiculous aspects of it.</v>

1130
00:31:26.730 --> 00:31:27.930
<v Speaker 3>It's all part of us,</v>

1131
00:31:28.140 --> 00:31:28.561
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

1132
00:31:28.561 --> 00:31:30.300
<v Speaker 3>And you don't want to be locked out.</v>

1133
00:31:30.330 --> 00:31:32.840
<v Speaker 3>I don't buy that being locked out when I talked to someone and go,</v>

1134
00:31:32.841 --> 00:31:33.690
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you have an email,</v>

<v Speaker 3>You don't want an email.</v>

1138
00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:40.350
<v Speaker 3>You don't want people to be able to send you cool shit that you can read.</v>

1139
00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:41.460
<v Speaker 3>You didn't want photos.</v>

1140
00:31:41.461 --> 00:31:42.600
<v Speaker 3>That'll blow your mind.</v>

1141
00:31:42.780 --> 00:31:46.170
<v Speaker 3>You don't want someone turning you on to some fucking article that might change</v>

1142
00:31:46.171 --> 00:31:46.830
<v Speaker 3>your life.</v>

<v Speaker 3>You don't want that.</v>

1144
00:31:47.610 --> 00:31:48.270
<v Speaker 3>You don't want that.</v>

1145
00:31:48.270 --> 00:31:48.690
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

1148
00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:51.121
<v Speaker 3>Sniff flowers.</v>

<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

1154
00:31:54.221 --> 00:31:57.250
<v Speaker 1>do they want to just affect only the few people in the village?</v>

1155
00:31:57.251 --> 00:31:58.420
<v Speaker 1>If you're a real shot and be like,</v>

1156
00:31:58.421 --> 00:31:58.661
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1157
00:31:58.661 --> 00:31:59.051
<v Speaker 1>fuck yeah,</v>

1158
00:31:59.051 --> 00:32:00.260
<v Speaker 1>I want to get my word out there.</v>

1159
00:32:00.390 --> 00:32:01.300
<v Speaker 1>I want to make change.</v>

1160
00:32:01.301 --> 00:32:02.290
<v Speaker 1>I want to make things happen.</v>

1161
00:32:02.590 --> 00:32:06.010
<v Speaker 1>And I think it goes back to kind of what Pressfield says about professionals,</v>

1162
00:32:06.011 --> 00:32:07.150
<v Speaker 1>like the professional,</v>

1163
00:32:07.180 --> 00:32:08.860
<v Speaker 1>the shamans down there were professionals.</v>

1164
00:32:08.861 --> 00:32:10.300
<v Speaker 1>They're not trying to be shamans.</v>

1165
00:32:10.510 --> 00:32:11.610
<v Speaker 1>They just fucking are.</v>

1166
00:32:11.611 --> 00:32:12.431
<v Speaker 1>That's their job.</v>

1167
00:32:12.431 --> 00:32:13.264
<v Speaker 1>That's what they do.</v>

1168
00:32:13.330 --> 00:32:14.410
<v Speaker 1>And they're professionals at it.</v>

1169
00:32:14.411 --> 00:32:14.801
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

1170
00:32:14.801 --> 00:32:15.880
<v Speaker 1>the Internet comes along,</v>

1171
00:32:16.090 --> 00:32:17.470
<v Speaker 1>they analyze that tool and they're like,</v>

1172
00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:17.801
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>

1173
00:32:17.801 --> 00:32:18.550
<v Speaker 1>that's cool.</v>

1174
00:32:18.550 --> 00:32:18.761
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

1175
00:32:18.761 --> 00:32:21.160
<v Speaker 1>Or if something funny happens in the middle of their ceremony,</v>

1176
00:32:21.250 --> 00:32:22.083
<v Speaker 1>they're not like,</v>

1177
00:32:22.090 --> 00:32:23.140
<v Speaker 1>I better not laugh.</v>

1178
00:32:23.141 --> 00:32:24.970
<v Speaker 1>Or people might think that I'm not a showman.</v>

1179
00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:25.481
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

1180
00:32:25.481 --> 00:32:26.110
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

1181
00:32:26.110 --> 00:32:28.030
<v Speaker 1>they'll fucking crack up and be like,</v>

1182
00:32:28.060 --> 00:32:28.210
<v Speaker 1>ah.</v>

1183
00:32:28.210 --> 00:32:30.130
<v Speaker 1>And then they'll just get back to their work when they're done.</v>

1184
00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:34.810
<v Speaker 1>They don't take themselves so seriously that it's like anything could shake the</v>

1185
00:32:34.811 --> 00:32:35.441
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>

1186
00:32:35.441 --> 00:32:36.460
<v Speaker 1>It's not for other people.</v>

1187
00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:39.650
<v Speaker 1>They're going to do their work and whatever happens when they do their work,</v>

1188
00:32:39.770 --> 00:32:40.280
<v Speaker 1>that's fine.</v>

1189
00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:41.040
<v Speaker 1>They go with it.</v>

1190
00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:44.960
<v Speaker 1>And that was something I really appreciate it because even when you get out here</v>

1191
00:32:44.961 --> 00:32:47.540
<v Speaker 1>in this kind of slightly pseudo spiritual thing,</v>

1192
00:32:47.541 --> 00:32:49.040
<v Speaker 1>it's like they're putting on an act,</v>

1193
00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:49.581
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1194
00:32:49.581 --> 00:32:51.500
<v Speaker 1>like the music has to be perfect and</v>

1195
00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:56.480
<v Speaker 1>the candles have to grow with the right and the crystal has to be without</v>

1196
00:32:56.481 --> 00:32:57.380
<v Speaker 1>impurities,</v>

1197
00:32:57.620 --> 00:32:57.950
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1198
00:32:57.950 --> 00:32:58.700
<v Speaker 1>And they're like,</v>

1199
00:32:58.700 --> 00:32:59.241
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1200
00:32:59.241 --> 00:32:59.421
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1201
00:32:59.421 --> 00:33:00.310
<v Speaker 1>if they use rocks,</v>

1202
00:33:00.311 --> 00:33:01.010
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>

1203
00:33:01.010 --> 00:33:02.030
<v Speaker 1>this is a good rock,</v>

1204
00:33:02.031 --> 00:33:02.301
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1205
00:33:02.301 --> 00:33:04.370
<v Speaker 1>and it just looks like a fucking rock</v>

1206
00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:05.670
<v Speaker 3>spiritual bullshit.</v>

1207
00:33:05.671 --> 00:33:07.560
<v Speaker 3>Spiritual talk is the grossest shit.</v>

1208
00:33:07.780 --> 00:33:08.280
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1209
00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:09.750
<v Speaker 3>I got married by a hack.</v>

1210
00:33:10.380 --> 00:33:12.200
<v Speaker 3>We got some lady off the Internet that married.</v>

1211
00:33:12.201 --> 00:33:12.540
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

1212
00:33:12.540 --> 00:33:12.811
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1213
00:33:12.811 --> 00:33:13.890
<v Speaker 3>it was brutal.</v>

1214
00:33:14.190 --> 00:33:19.190
<v Speaker 3>Your love is two streams that will become together a growing river.</v>

1215
00:33:20.220 --> 00:33:22.800
<v Speaker 3>It will wash over the rocks of the world.</v>

1216
00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:22.980
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1217
00:33:22.980 --> 00:33:23.191
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1218
00:33:23.191 --> 00:33:24.360
<v Speaker 3>you crazy bitch.</v>

1219
00:33:24.570 --> 00:33:26.730
<v Speaker 3>There was no feeling to it at all.</v>

1220
00:33:26.820 --> 00:33:28.050
<v Speaker 3>Like as she was saying it,</v>

1221
00:33:28.051 --> 00:33:30.180
<v Speaker 3>there was no connection to the words.</v>

1222
00:33:30.420 --> 00:33:35.420
<v Speaker 3>It was just utter spiritual nonsense because it was a nondenominational wedding,</v>

1223
00:33:35.910 --> 00:33:36.301
<v Speaker 3>obviously,</v>

1224
00:33:36.301 --> 00:33:37.710
<v Speaker 3>because I'm not religious.</v>

1225
00:33:37.711 --> 00:33:38.790
<v Speaker 3>Nora's Mrs Rogan.</v>

1226
00:33:39.210 --> 00:33:44.210
<v Speaker 3>So it had a listen to this nonsense crystal sucking fucking ideas.</v>

1227
00:33:44.430 --> 00:33:46.050
<v Speaker 3>Marriott world of Narnia.</v>

1228
00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:47.273
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1229
00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:49.050
<v Speaker 3>This bitch lived at totally in Narnia.</v>

1230
00:33:49.051 --> 00:33:50.220
<v Speaker 3>She had a hut in Narnia.</v>

1231
00:33:51.790 --> 00:33:52.950
<v Speaker 3>It was brutal.</v>

1232
00:33:53.340 --> 00:33:53.551
<v Speaker 3>This,</v>

1233
00:33:53.551 --> 00:33:54.090
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1234
00:33:54.090 --> 00:33:56.280
<v Speaker 3>I found the article about the Colombian showman.</v>

1235
00:33:56.580 --> 00:33:59.850
<v Speaker 3>He was arrested in Texas and charged with IOWASCA possession.</v>

1236
00:34:00.180 --> 00:34:02.250
<v Speaker 3>He flew into the Houston airport.</v>

1237
00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:07.230
<v Speaker 3>And the crazy thing about being charged with Iowasca possession is the plants</v>

1238
00:34:07.231 --> 00:34:10.050
<v Speaker 3>that you use to create Iowasca or not even illegal.</v>

1239
00:34:11.580 --> 00:34:13.410
<v Speaker 3>That's the weirdest aspect of it.</v>

1240
00:34:13.470 --> 00:34:14.130
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1241
00:34:14.130 --> 00:34:17.700
<v Speaker 3>I met the guy from bouncing bear botanicals.</v>

1242
00:34:17.730 --> 00:34:19.200
<v Speaker 3>He came to my show in Vegas.</v>

1243
00:34:19.530 --> 00:34:20.363
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1244
00:34:20.460 --> 00:34:20.880
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1245
00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:22.020
<v Speaker 3>if you don't know the story,</v>

1246
00:34:22.021 --> 00:34:25.710
<v Speaker 3>there was a guy who ran a website called bouncing bear botanicals and it's a</v>

1247
00:34:25.711 --> 00:34:30.711
<v Speaker 3>website all dedicated to selling legal plants that have psychedelic properties</v>

1248
00:34:30.961 --> 00:34:31.500
<v Speaker 3>to them.</v>

1249
00:34:31.500 --> 00:34:35.220
<v Speaker 3>Like the San Pedro Cactus that you could buy at fucking home depot.</v>

1250
00:34:35.580 --> 00:34:35.851
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1251
00:34:35.851 --> 00:34:37.860
<v Speaker 3>Well you can make Mescalin out of that shit.</v>

1252
00:34:38.010 --> 00:34:38.461
<v Speaker 3>You can,</v>

1253
00:34:38.461 --> 00:34:39.630
<v Speaker 3>you can open that bitch up,</v>

1254
00:34:39.631 --> 00:34:42.750
<v Speaker 3>make some Payoti if you know what you're doing and trip your balls off.</v>

1255
00:34:42.870 --> 00:34:46.470
<v Speaker 3>This is off some shit that you just buy at home depot and it's totally legal.</v>

1256
00:34:46.620 --> 00:34:49.230
<v Speaker 3>It's a beautiful cactus and a lot of people don't even know about the</v>

1257
00:34:49.231 --> 00:34:50.520
<v Speaker 3>psychedelic properties of it.</v>

1258
00:34:50.640 --> 00:34:52.980
<v Speaker 3>They have it just to decorate their garden because it's pretty,</v>

1259
00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:55.710
<v Speaker 3>but it's not illegal.</v>

1260
00:34:55.920 --> 00:34:56.970
<v Speaker 3>So they,</v>

1261
00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:57.661
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

1262
00:34:57.661 --> 00:34:58.740
<v Speaker 3>he has this there,</v>

1263
00:34:58.770 --> 00:34:59.491
<v Speaker 3>he's selling this,</v>

1264
00:34:59.491 --> 00:35:04.050
<v Speaker 3>he's selling the different circuitry had Veritas and the different plants that</v>

1265
00:35:04.051 --> 00:35:06.570
<v Speaker 3>you mix to make Iowasca he's selling those.</v>

1266
00:35:06.571 --> 00:35:07.391
<v Speaker 3>He's selling Salvia.</v>

1267
00:35:07.391 --> 00:35:11.790
<v Speaker 3>I sang all these different plants that are absolutely legal morning glory seeds.</v>

1268
00:35:11.970 --> 00:35:14.730
<v Speaker 3>You know a lot of people don't know that morning glory,</v>

1269
00:35:14.731 --> 00:35:15.091
<v Speaker 3>seeds,</v>

1270
00:35:15.091 --> 00:35:19.080
<v Speaker 3>just those regular fucking seeds that you buy when you go to plant to make</v>

1271
00:35:19.081 --> 00:35:19.800
<v Speaker 3>flowers.</v>

1272
00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:21.060
<v Speaker 3>Well the ones that you buy,</v>

1273
00:35:21.061 --> 00:35:21.894
<v Speaker 3>most of them,</v>

1274
00:35:21.990 --> 00:35:26.990
<v Speaker 3>they've been treated so that they are not psychoactive because regular morning</v>

1275
00:35:27.031 --> 00:35:27.870
<v Speaker 3>glory seeds,</v>

1276
00:35:27.930 --> 00:35:32.670
<v Speaker 3>you can grind those bitches up and eat them and you'll trip your fucking balls</v>

1277
00:35:32.671 --> 00:35:33.300
<v Speaker 3>off.</v>

1278
00:35:33.300 --> 00:35:34.410
<v Speaker 3>Hell yeah.</v>

1279
00:35:34.490 --> 00:35:35.560
<v Speaker 1>So untreated,</v>

1280
00:35:35.580 --> 00:35:36.430
<v Speaker 1>they're still your,</v>

1281
00:35:36.431 --> 00:35:37.170
<v Speaker 1>their legal,</v>

1282
00:35:37.170 --> 00:35:38.160
<v Speaker 1>you can buy the untreated</v>

1283
00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:38.970
<v Speaker 3>ones.</v>

1284
00:35:38.970 --> 00:35:40.050
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to get,</v>

1285
00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:41.370
<v Speaker 3>it's hard to get the untreated ones.</v>

1286
00:35:41.371 --> 00:35:44.160
<v Speaker 3>You're supposed to treat them because the government is aware of the psychedelic</v>

1287
00:35:44.161 --> 00:35:44.994
<v Speaker 3>properties of them.</v>

1288
00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:45.470
<v Speaker 3>Meanwhile,</v>

1289
00:35:45.470 --> 00:35:45.701
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1290
00:35:45.701 --> 00:35:49.370
<v Speaker 3>of course it's not nearly as dangerous as cigarettes or alcohol or any of the</v>

1291
00:35:49.380 --> 00:35:50.340
<v Speaker 3>things they sanction,</v>

1292
00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:54.660
<v Speaker 3>but it's to mind bending for the government allowed the unwashed masses to</v>

1293
00:35:54.661 --> 00:35:55.411
<v Speaker 3>participate in.</v>

1294
00:35:55.411 --> 00:35:59.790
<v Speaker 3>So your wise daddy government is figured out how to neuter this incredibly</v>

1295
00:35:59.791 --> 00:36:03.240
<v Speaker 3>brilliant psychedelic plant to the point where most people aren't even aware of</v>

1296
00:36:03.241 --> 00:36:04.074
<v Speaker 3>its properties.</v>

1297
00:36:04.230 --> 00:36:08.250
<v Speaker 3>But regular morning glory seeds was Terence Mckenna's first psychedelic trip.</v>

1298
00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:10.860
<v Speaker 3>That's what sent him on his fucking wacky journey of,</v>

1299
00:36:10.890 --> 00:36:11.210
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1300
00:36:11.210 --> 00:36:13.530
<v Speaker 3>being psychedelic Shawman of the,</v>

1301
00:36:13.550 --> 00:36:14.580
<v Speaker 3>the new world.</v>

1302
00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:15.270
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1303
00:36:15.270 --> 00:36:16.680
<v Speaker 3>and that was a,</v>

1304
00:36:16.710 --> 00:36:17.011
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1305
00:36:17.011 --> 00:36:20.970
<v Speaker 3>a common thing that people did in the 70s and the 60s before the government got</v>

1306
00:36:20.971 --> 00:36:21.720
<v Speaker 3>hip to it.</v>

1307
00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:24.720
<v Speaker 3>They were just tripping balls and morning glory seeds,</v>

1308
00:36:25.290 --> 00:36:25.620
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

1309
00:36:25.620 --> 00:36:26.291
<v Speaker 3>So this guy,</v>

1310
00:36:26.291 --> 00:36:30.030
<v Speaker 3>this John or he says that was saying from bouncing bear botanicals.</v>

1311
00:36:30.090 --> 00:36:30.391
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>

1312
00:36:30.391 --> 00:36:31.800
<v Speaker 3>there's two dudes that I met that came,</v>

1313
00:36:31.801 --> 00:36:34.200
<v Speaker 3>they were high as fuck there was so high,</v>

1314
00:36:34.201 --> 00:36:35.670
<v Speaker 3>I can barely talk to them after the show.</v>

1315
00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:39.540
<v Speaker 3>They came to my last Vegas show and I talked to them outside and that swarm of</v>

1316
00:36:39.541 --> 00:36:39.871
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

1317
00:36:39.871 --> 00:36:42.810
<v Speaker 3>remember there's all two of those of those crazy guys.</v>

1318
00:36:42.990 --> 00:36:44.610
<v Speaker 3>They were trying to have like a serious conversation with me.</v>

1319
00:36:44.620 --> 00:36:44.790
<v Speaker 3>Me,</v>

1320
00:36:44.790 --> 00:36:48.840
<v Speaker 3>it was like 500 people trying to take pictures and they want to hold on in my</v>

1321
00:36:48.841 --> 00:36:49.451
<v Speaker 3>hand and talk to him.</v>

1322
00:36:49.451 --> 00:36:49.650
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1323
00:36:49.650 --> 00:36:49.750
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

1324
00:36:49.750 --> 00:36:50.583
<v Speaker 3>wasn't a lot of people here.</v>

1325
00:36:50.610 --> 00:36:52.260
<v Speaker 3>I can't remember to talk to you about your arrest.</v>

1326
00:36:52.860 --> 00:36:53.940
<v Speaker 3>Glad you're doing the right thing.</v>

1327
00:36:53.941 --> 00:36:54.774
<v Speaker 3>Glad you got out.</v>

1328
00:36:54.780 --> 00:36:56.130
<v Speaker 3>But apparently they let him out of jail.</v>

1329
00:36:56.131 --> 00:36:57.930
<v Speaker 3>They had to let him out eventually because,</v>

1330
00:36:57.931 --> 00:36:58.080
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1331
00:36:58.080 --> 00:36:58.500
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

1332
00:36:58.500 --> 00:36:58.801
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1333
00:36:58.801 --> 00:37:00.860
<v Speaker 3>there's nothing he can fucking charge him for there.</v>

1334
00:37:00.900 --> 00:37:04.110
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing that said that he was making drugs trashed.</v>

1335
00:37:04.111 --> 00:37:05.250
<v Speaker 3>His place crashes,</v>

1336
00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:06.840
<v Speaker 3>confiscated all the state.</v>

1337
00:37:06.841 --> 00:37:07.950
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if he got his money back,</v>

1338
00:37:07.951 --> 00:37:10.170
<v Speaker 3>but they froze all that as well for nothing,</v>

1339
00:37:10.620 --> 00:37:11.430
<v Speaker 3>for nothing.</v>

1340
00:37:11.430 --> 00:37:14.070
<v Speaker 3>Because the government is scared of psychedelics.</v>

1341
00:37:14.071 --> 00:37:15.960
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing how scared they are of it.</v>

1342
00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:19.020
<v Speaker 3>And I guarantee you they're scared of it because they're not experiencing it.</v>

1343
00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:20.040
<v Speaker 3>It's that simple.</v>

1344
00:37:20.100 --> 00:37:22.770
<v Speaker 3>Like when you get into like Alex Jones believes crazy shit.</v>

1345
00:37:22.771 --> 00:37:25.140
<v Speaker 3>Like he believes that the elites were all smoking DMT.</v>

1346
00:37:25.350 --> 00:37:26.470
<v Speaker 3>Like they're all up in,</v>

1347
00:37:26.490 --> 00:37:26.761
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1348
00:37:26.761 --> 00:37:27.720
<v Speaker 3>Hilton Talk to you about,</v>

1349
00:37:27.721 --> 00:37:29.970
<v Speaker 3>they're all in fucking and shit where Guantanamo Bay,</v>

1350
00:37:30.300 --> 00:37:33.990
<v Speaker 3>they're all down in Guantanamo Bay and they are smoking DMT,</v>

1351
00:37:34.050 --> 00:37:35.460
<v Speaker 3>connecting to the spirit world.</v>

1352
00:37:35.461 --> 00:37:37.980
<v Speaker 3>They believe in eternal life what they're going to do.</v>

1353
00:37:38.070 --> 00:37:41.610
<v Speaker 3>And he'll tell you all this nonsense that he absolutely positively believes in,</v>

1354
00:37:41.940 --> 00:37:46.770
<v Speaker 3>but I believe 100% you cannot smoke DMT and not be empathetic towards other</v>

1355
00:37:46.771 --> 00:37:47.700
<v Speaker 3>people that are doing it.</v>

1356
00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:52.560
<v Speaker 3>You cannot take Iowa school or mushrooms without being empathetic and wanting</v>

1357
00:37:52.561 --> 00:37:53.281
<v Speaker 3>other people to do it.</v>

1358
00:37:53.281 --> 00:37:55.650
<v Speaker 3>These people that are trying to keep everybody from it,</v>

1359
00:37:55.740 --> 00:37:58.740
<v Speaker 3>those are the people sending their dicks to their fucking secretaries and their</v>

1360
00:37:58.741 --> 00:37:59.430
<v Speaker 3>emails.</v>

1361
00:37:59.430 --> 00:38:00.600
<v Speaker 3>Those are the fucking hypocrite,</v>

1362
00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:05.820
<v Speaker 3>hypocritical shitheads with huge flaws and their character that we have running</v>

1363
00:38:05.821 --> 00:38:07.560
<v Speaker 3>this country and running this world.</v>

1364
00:38:07.770 --> 00:38:09.930
<v Speaker 3>And unfortunately that's,</v>

1365
00:38:10.230 --> 00:38:14.190
<v Speaker 3>that's one of our biggest issues are what we considered leaders.</v>

1366
00:38:14.280 --> 00:38:18.660
<v Speaker 3>We know for sure that it's a bullshit scam and we allow it.</v>

1367
00:38:18.661 --> 00:38:19.050
<v Speaker 3>We have,</v>

1368
00:38:19.050 --> 00:38:20.760
<v Speaker 3>we have resigned ourselves.</v>

1369
00:38:20.940 --> 00:38:23.340
<v Speaker 3>We know that the president has speech writers.</v>

1370
00:38:23.580 --> 00:38:27.570
<v Speaker 3>We know that everyone has a bunch of people that will review every word that</v>

1371
00:38:27.571 --> 00:38:30.810
<v Speaker 3>he's going to say and it's going to be calculated and they're going to sit down</v>

1372
00:38:30.811 --> 00:38:32.110
<v Speaker 3>and come up with the,</v>

1373
00:38:32.111 --> 00:38:37.111
<v Speaker 3>the the right words and enact the most emotional impact to the point where they</v>

1374
00:38:37.601 --> 00:38:38.410
<v Speaker 3>even fucking,</v>

1375
00:38:38.410 --> 00:38:41.710
<v Speaker 3>they used to plagiarize other people's speeches before they got busted for it.</v>

1376
00:38:41.860 --> 00:38:42.610
<v Speaker 3>Joe Biden,</v>

1377
00:38:42.610 --> 00:38:45.160
<v Speaker 3>our own fucking vice president used to plagiarize.</v>

1378
00:38:45.161 --> 00:38:46.930
<v Speaker 3>He blew plagiarized Kennedy Shit.</v>

1379
00:38:47.130 --> 00:38:47.261
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1380
00:38:47.261 --> 00:38:50.170
<v Speaker 3>they caught them doing that in 1,988 that's why he had to quit running for</v>

1381
00:38:50.171 --> 00:38:51.004
<v Speaker 3>president,</v>

1382
00:38:51.220 --> 00:38:51.641
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1383
00:38:51.641 --> 00:38:54.370
<v Speaker 3>and that's why he had to like sit in the background and wait for everybody to</v>

1384
00:38:54.371 --> 00:38:56.530
<v Speaker 3>kind of forget about it before he could be vice president.</v>

1385
00:38:56.980 --> 00:38:57.191
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1386
00:38:57.191 --> 00:38:58.840
<v Speaker 3>we know for a fact that it's,</v>

1387
00:38:58.841 --> 00:38:59.201
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>

1388
00:38:59.201 --> 00:39:00.400
<v Speaker 3>it's a bullshit hustle.</v>

1389
00:39:00.550 --> 00:39:02.350
<v Speaker 3>We're all aware of lobbyists.</v>

1390
00:39:02.351 --> 00:39:07.330
<v Speaker 3>We're all aware of special interest groups and corporations donating millions of</v>

1391
00:39:07.330 --> 00:39:07.420
<v Speaker 3>dollars.</v>

1392
00:39:07.420 --> 00:39:11.260
<v Speaker 3>We're all aware that the supreme court changed the ruling so that a corporation</v>

1393
00:39:11.261 --> 00:39:12.880
<v Speaker 3>can now act as an individual.</v>

1394
00:39:12.970 --> 00:39:15.280
<v Speaker 3>So they can donate as much fucking money as they want,</v>

1395
00:39:15.430 --> 00:39:16.720
<v Speaker 3>which is absurd.</v>

1396
00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:19.930
<v Speaker 3>The idea that a corporation that would rely on politicians and their,</v>

1397
00:39:19.931 --> 00:39:20.231
<v Speaker 3>their,</v>

1398
00:39:20.231 --> 00:39:23.950
<v Speaker 3>their decisions to make money in a way that may or may not be ethical,</v>

1399
00:39:24.130 --> 00:39:29.130
<v Speaker 3>but they'll rely on and then they just donated x amount of fucking millions of</v>

1400
00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:30.280
<v Speaker 3>dollars towards this person.</v>

1401
00:39:30.430 --> 00:39:31.090
<v Speaker 3>It's insane.</v>

1402
00:39:31.090 --> 00:39:31.923
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing.</v>

1403
00:39:32.020 --> 00:39:35.290
<v Speaker 3>And we accept it for now because things are relatively placid,</v>

1404
00:39:35.310 --> 00:39:35.620
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

1405
00:39:35.620 --> 00:39:35.891
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1406
00:39:35.891 --> 00:39:37.900
<v Speaker 3>We have some little few financial difficulties,</v>

1407
00:39:37.901 --> 00:39:39.220
<v Speaker 3>but whatever people's lives,</v>

1408
00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:43.630
<v Speaker 3>they go on and we go and you know what they're saying about 2012 is had at</v>

1409
00:39:43.631 --> 00:39:46.150
<v Speaker 3>certain point things aren't going to be fucking plastic anymore.</v>

1410
00:39:46.151 --> 00:39:48.430
<v Speaker 3>And at that point we're not going to accept that bullshit.</v>

1411
00:39:48.431 --> 00:39:52.660
<v Speaker 3>We're not going to expect except these weak ass politicians who don't really</v>

1412
00:39:52.661 --> 00:39:54.640
<v Speaker 3>stand for anything to lead us anymore.</v>

1413
00:39:54.641 --> 00:39:55.660
<v Speaker 3>So what's going to happen?</v>

1414
00:39:55.840 --> 00:39:56.591
<v Speaker 3>Who the fuck knows?</v>

1415
00:39:56.591 --> 00:39:56.951
<v Speaker 3>They don't know.</v>

1416
00:39:56.951 --> 00:39:57.641
<v Speaker 3>They don't have the answer,</v>

1417
00:39:57.641 --> 00:40:00.790
<v Speaker 3>but they're going to say some type of new person is going to have to emerge and</v>

1418
00:40:00.791 --> 00:40:01.330
<v Speaker 3>be like,</v>

1419
00:40:01.330 --> 00:40:01.960
<v Speaker 3>Yo,</v>

1420
00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:02.920
<v Speaker 3>this is bullshit.</v>

1421
00:40:02.950 --> 00:40:05.170
<v Speaker 3>Like we needed to make some changes now.</v>

1422
00:40:05.171 --> 00:40:06.520
<v Speaker 3>Like things are getting fucked up,</v>

1423
00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:08.020
<v Speaker 3>even worse and worse.</v>

1424
00:40:08.080 --> 00:40:08.970
<v Speaker 3>Have you seen the,</v>

1425
00:40:08.971 --> 00:40:09.270
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1426
00:40:09.270 --> 00:40:11.320
<v Speaker 3>the numbers that they did when they were,</v>

1427
00:40:11.321 --> 00:40:12.730
<v Speaker 3>they did an audit of the,</v>

1428
00:40:12.731 --> 00:40:12.851
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1429
00:40:12.851 --> 00:40:16.600
<v Speaker 3>the Fed to find out where the fucking money went for the bailout and they found</v>

1430
00:40:16.601 --> 00:40:21.601
<v Speaker 3>trillions of dollars that went to these weird fucking overseas banks.</v>

1431
00:40:22.030 --> 00:40:27.030
<v Speaker 3>And it's totally beyond description how much corruption and ridiculous bullshit</v>

1432
00:40:28.241 --> 00:40:32.860
<v Speaker 3>is involved and how little accountability there is for this distribution of,</v>

1433
00:40:32.861 --> 00:40:34.120
<v Speaker 3>of the taxpayers wealth.</v>

1434
00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:34.691
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1435
00:40:34.691 --> 00:40:36.730
<v Speaker 3>it's a fucking free for all,</v>

1436
00:40:36.731 --> 00:40:37.390
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1437
00:40:37.390 --> 00:40:38.770
<v Speaker 3>It's craziness.</v>

1438
00:40:38.980 --> 00:40:42.400
<v Speaker 3>So it's to say that there's a few financial difficulties.</v>

1439
00:40:42.401 --> 00:40:47.350
<v Speaker 3>The whole thing is built on this foundation of unfixable bullshit and there's no</v>

1440
00:40:47.351 --> 00:40:48.400
<v Speaker 3>solution in sight.</v>

1441
00:40:48.490 --> 00:40:49.323
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1442
00:40:49.460 --> 00:40:50.350
<v Speaker 3>that's worse.</v>

1443
00:40:50.351 --> 00:40:50.590
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1444
00:40:50.590 --> 00:40:53.080
<v Speaker 3>that is getting more credit rating about to be downgraded.</v>

1445
00:40:53.170 --> 00:40:54.010
<v Speaker 3>China already did.</v>

1446
00:40:54.040 --> 00:40:56.350
<v Speaker 3>They downgraded our credit rating even though we didn't default,</v>

1447
00:40:56.620 --> 00:40:57.890
<v Speaker 3>even though we raised our,</v>

1448
00:40:57.891 --> 00:40:58.210
<v Speaker 3>our,</v>

1449
00:40:58.210 --> 00:40:59.260
<v Speaker 3>our debt ceiling,</v>

1450
00:40:59.261 --> 00:40:59.561
<v Speaker 3>they're like,</v>

1451
00:40:59.561 --> 00:41:01.210
<v Speaker 3>these bitches are like on the edge.</v>

1452
00:41:01.630 --> 00:41:02.090
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1453
00:41:02.090 --> 00:41:03.940
<v Speaker 3>it's like when you try to get too many loans,</v>

1454
00:41:03.941 --> 00:41:05.200
<v Speaker 3>even if you pay your loans back,</v>

1455
00:41:05.210 --> 00:41:06.430
<v Speaker 3>the banks are going,</v>

1456
00:41:06.431 --> 00:41:07.810
<v Speaker 3>why are you asking for all this money?</v>

1457
00:41:07.811 --> 00:41:08.081
<v Speaker 3>Dude,</v>

1458
00:41:08.081 --> 00:41:08.380
<v Speaker 3>what are you,</v>

1459
00:41:08.380 --> 00:41:09.310
<v Speaker 3>what's going on with you?</v>

1460
00:41:09.690 --> 00:41:10.960
<v Speaker 3>But you've got a gambling problem.</v>

1461
00:41:11.410 --> 00:41:12.400
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

1462
00:41:12.460 --> 00:41:12.671
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1463
00:41:12.671 --> 00:41:13.030
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1464
00:41:13.030 --> 00:41:13.290
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1465
00:41:13.290 --> 00:41:13.960
<v Speaker 3>it's not,</v>

1466
00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:16.870
<v Speaker 3>it's not fucking getting fixed in the system.</v>

1467
00:41:16.900 --> 00:41:17.590
<v Speaker 3>And this,</v>

1468
00:41:17.590 --> 00:41:17.860
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1469
00:41:17.860 --> 00:41:18.051
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1470
00:41:18.051 --> 00:41:18.261
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1471
00:41:18.261 --> 00:41:20.830
<v Speaker 3>the way it's set up right now and the model that we're operating under,</v>

1472
00:41:20.831 --> 00:41:23.050
<v Speaker 3>it's not getting fixed and everyone's frustrated.</v>

1473
00:41:23.051 --> 00:41:24.280
<v Speaker 3>No one knows that knows what to do.</v>

1474
00:41:24.281 --> 00:41:26.380
<v Speaker 3>And me like you,</v>

1475
00:41:26.410 --> 00:41:28.690
<v Speaker 3>like I'm the fucking completely full of Shit.</v>

1476
00:41:28.691 --> 00:41:30.700
<v Speaker 3>All I do is just complain about it.</v>

1477
00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:34.310
<v Speaker 3>And then I go about my day and as long as I have food in the refrigerator and I</v>

1478
00:41:34.311 --> 00:41:37.070
<v Speaker 3>have the ability to use my credit card to buy gas,</v>

1479
00:41:37.550 --> 00:41:39.170
<v Speaker 3>I'm only gonna Yap too much.</v>

1480
00:41:39.230 --> 00:41:39.920
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1481
00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:44.750
<v Speaker 3>it almost like it has to fall apart on all of us before we step back and we go,</v>

1482
00:41:44.751 --> 00:41:45.111
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

1483
00:41:45.111 --> 00:41:45.351
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

1484
00:41:45.351 --> 00:41:46.460
<v Speaker 3>well now we have to admit</v>

1485
00:41:46.700 --> 00:41:47.540
<v Speaker 1>doesn't work right?</v>

1486
00:41:47.990 --> 00:41:48.860
<v Speaker 1>Well what you're doing,</v>

1487
00:41:48.861 --> 00:41:50.690
<v Speaker 1>but you're doing something more important than that,</v>

1488
00:41:50.691 --> 00:41:51.381
<v Speaker 1>I think as well,</v>

1489
00:41:51.381 --> 00:41:54.020
<v Speaker 1>is that you're creating a movement of consciousness.</v>

1490
00:41:54.021 --> 00:41:56.480
<v Speaker 1>I mean every time new people turn it tune in,</v>

1491
00:41:56.630 --> 00:41:58.460
<v Speaker 1>you know you have their ear and these people,</v>

1492
00:41:58.620 --> 00:42:00.300
<v Speaker 1>but I have no activated of no,</v>

1493
00:42:00.740 --> 00:42:02.540
<v Speaker 1>there's no crisis yet necessarily.</v>

1494
00:42:02.570 --> 00:42:02.901
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1495
00:42:02.901 --> 00:42:04.580
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of where is though.</v>

1496
00:42:04.610 --> 00:42:05.430
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1497
00:42:05.430 --> 00:42:05.871
<v Speaker 1>kind of.</v>

1498
00:42:05.871 --> 00:42:09.590
<v Speaker 1>Probably if we had the foresight to really look ahead and start doing things</v>

1499
00:42:09.591 --> 00:42:09.831
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

1500
00:42:09.831 --> 00:42:14.420
<v Speaker 1>but it's not pressured enough like it's not beating down our door so it's just</v>

1501
00:42:14.421 --> 00:42:15.560
<v Speaker 1>really not going to happen.</v>

1502
00:42:15.561 --> 00:42:16.281
<v Speaker 1>Realistically,</v>

1503
00:42:16.281 --> 00:42:18.470
<v Speaker 1>we probably not that we shouldn't try and do it or whatever.</v>

1504
00:42:18.471 --> 00:42:19.041
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying that,</v>

1505
00:42:19.041 --> 00:42:20.450
<v Speaker 1>but so much work though.</v>

1506
00:42:20.540 --> 00:42:21.141
<v Speaker 1>That's the problem.</v>

1507
00:42:21.141 --> 00:42:23.990
<v Speaker 1>If you want to live your life at some point when things get fucked,</v>

1508
00:42:23.991 --> 00:42:25.370
<v Speaker 1>you know you may have,</v>

1509
00:42:25.460 --> 00:42:28.280
<v Speaker 1>this is the Joe Rogan fucking emergency podcasts.</v>

1510
00:42:28.310 --> 00:42:28.940
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>

1511
00:42:28.940 --> 00:42:30.680
<v Speaker 1>like this is what needs to happen.</v>

1512
00:42:30.860 --> 00:42:32.270
<v Speaker 1>Like seriously and you'll have,</v>

1513
00:42:32.420 --> 00:42:36.590
<v Speaker 1>you'll have that power like fucking John Connor for your own small people of</v>

1514
00:42:36.591 --> 00:42:40.460
<v Speaker 1>conscious fucking humans who are going to be able to then go out and like,</v>

1515
00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:41.150
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

1516
00:42:41.150 --> 00:42:42.890
<v Speaker 1>everything we're being fed is nonsense.</v>

1517
00:42:42.891 --> 00:42:43.470
<v Speaker 1>Don't use it.</v>

1518
00:42:43.470 --> 00:42:44.510
<v Speaker 1>The shit goes down.</v>

1519
00:42:44.740 --> 00:42:46.960
<v Speaker 3>The Internet is going to be the first thing they shut off.</v>

1520
00:42:47.900 --> 00:42:49.230
<v Speaker 1>They tried to do that in another country.</v>

1521
00:42:49.231 --> 00:42:50.460
<v Speaker 1>So they have,</v>

1522
00:42:50.461 --> 00:42:51.090
<v Speaker 1>they've done it.</v>

1523
00:42:51.090 --> 00:42:51.510
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

1524
00:42:51.510 --> 00:42:54.630
<v Speaker 1>there were did in Libya when they do it in Egypt,</v>

1525
00:42:55.350 --> 00:42:55.681
<v Speaker 1>Egypt.</v>

1526
00:42:55.681 --> 00:42:56.760
<v Speaker 1>But there was still ways around it.</v>

1527
00:42:56.761 --> 00:42:57.860
<v Speaker 1>People were still getting mad.</v>

1528
00:42:58.370 --> 00:43:00.270
<v Speaker 1>He's going to intentionally fuck us.</v>

1529
00:43:00.271 --> 00:43:03.540
<v Speaker 1>I just think they're going to be incapable of helping us at that point.</v>

1530
00:43:03.720 --> 00:43:03.961
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1531
00:43:03.961 --> 00:43:05.040
<v Speaker 1>like that's my personal belief.</v>

1532
00:43:05.041 --> 00:43:05.820
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I'd be like,</v>

1533
00:43:05.820 --> 00:43:07.030
<v Speaker 1>shut the internet down.</v>

1534
00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:07.870
<v Speaker 1>It's just gonna be like,</v>

1535
00:43:07.870 --> 00:43:08.430
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

1536
00:43:08.430 --> 00:43:09.031
<v Speaker 1>what do we do?</v>

1537
00:43:09.031 --> 00:43:09.601
<v Speaker 1>We're a bunch of,</v>

1538
00:43:09.601 --> 00:43:09.811
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1539
00:43:09.811 --> 00:43:12.390
<v Speaker 1>we've never fucking stuck our hand in a glove full of ants.</v>

1540
00:43:12.391 --> 00:43:13.530
<v Speaker 1>We are not ready for this shit</v>

1541
00:43:14.780 --> 00:43:15.081
<v Speaker 3>either.</v>

1542
00:43:15.081 --> 00:43:15.561
<v Speaker 3>Or though.</v>

1543
00:43:15.561 --> 00:43:15.920
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1544
00:43:15.920 --> 00:43:17.240
<v Speaker 3>Good Bait could come either or.</v>

1545
00:43:17.480 --> 00:43:17.781
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1546
00:43:17.781 --> 00:43:21.020
<v Speaker 3>there's a reason why they do these fucking FEMA tests and they have,</v>

1547
00:43:21.190 --> 00:43:21.471
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1548
00:43:21.471 --> 00:43:24.740
<v Speaker 3>giant stockpiles of plastic coffins,</v>

1549
00:43:24.980 --> 00:43:25.161
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1550
00:43:25.161 --> 00:43:26.390
<v Speaker 3>that's all been documented.</v>

1551
00:43:26.391 --> 00:43:27.141
<v Speaker 3>They've prepared,</v>

1552
00:43:27.141 --> 00:43:31.460
<v Speaker 3>they have a lot of drills they prepared for mass extinction events and you know,</v>

1553
00:43:31.461 --> 00:43:31.731
<v Speaker 3>big,</v>

1554
00:43:31.731 --> 00:43:34.340
<v Speaker 3>huge environmental catastrophes.</v>

1555
00:43:34.341 --> 00:43:35.540
<v Speaker 3>Natural disasters.</v>

1556
00:43:35.541 --> 00:43:36.050
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1557
00:43:36.050 --> 00:43:37.310
<v Speaker 3>the government has camps,</v>

1558
00:43:37.340 --> 00:43:39.680
<v Speaker 3>they have FEMA camps and these are real,</v>

1559
00:43:39.830 --> 00:43:40.101
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1560
00:43:40.101 --> 00:43:41.150
<v Speaker 3>this is Alex Jones.</v>

1561
00:43:41.270 --> 00:43:41.781
<v Speaker 3>You know when he'll,</v>

1562
00:43:41.781 --> 00:43:43.040
<v Speaker 3>he'll start talking about FEMA camps,</v>

1563
00:43:43.041 --> 00:43:43.460
<v Speaker 3>but there's,</v>

1564
00:43:43.460 --> 00:43:44.293
<v Speaker 3>there's a real,</v>

1565
00:43:44.360 --> 00:43:47.420
<v Speaker 3>they're really do have places where they have cots set up and they have,</v>

1566
00:43:47.720 --> 00:43:48.500
<v Speaker 3>they have fucking,</v>

1567
00:43:48.500 --> 00:43:52.790
<v Speaker 3>almost like a prisoner of war camp because if the shit really does hit the fan,</v>

1568
00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:53.211
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1569
00:43:53.211 --> 00:43:55.510
<v Speaker 3>we get wiped out in nuclear war or you know,</v>

1570
00:43:55.511 --> 00:43:55.800
<v Speaker 3>or,</v>

1571
00:43:55.800 --> 00:43:59.390
<v Speaker 3>or a fucking asteroid hits or something nutty that fucks up the world.</v>

1572
00:43:59.750 --> 00:44:03.620
<v Speaker 3>We really are going to have to detain a lot of people were really going to have</v>

1573
00:44:03.621 --> 00:44:04.970
<v Speaker 3>to calm everybody the fuck down.</v>

1574
00:44:04.971 --> 00:44:06.380
<v Speaker 3>If we're going to evacuate areas,</v>

1575
00:44:06.530 --> 00:44:09.140
<v Speaker 3>we're going to have to have places to shelter these people.</v>

1576
00:44:09.260 --> 00:44:12.560
<v Speaker 3>We're going to have to have buses were women and children are crying and they're</v>

1577
00:44:12.561 --> 00:44:15.650
<v Speaker 3>being separated from the father and the father sitting there with a son and</v>

1578
00:44:15.860 --> 00:44:18.950
<v Speaker 3>we'll meet you at the camp and then that's real shit and they're going to get on</v>

1579
00:44:18.951 --> 00:44:21.590
<v Speaker 3>buses and we're not going to know where everybody is and we're not,</v>

1580
00:44:21.650 --> 00:44:22.730
<v Speaker 3>some people are not going to be,</v>

1581
00:44:22.770 --> 00:44:23.900
<v Speaker 3>that's possible.</v>

1582
00:44:24.140 --> 00:44:26.990
<v Speaker 3>This is a fucking fragile world we live in.</v>

1583
00:44:27.320 --> 00:44:27.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1584
00:44:27.680 --> 00:44:28.513
<v Speaker 1>it's possible.</v>

1585
00:44:28.550 --> 00:44:28.800
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1586
00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:29.301
<v Speaker 1>and little,</v>

1587
00:44:29.301 --> 00:44:31.010
<v Speaker 1>and then little colonies will get set up.</v>

1588
00:44:31.020 --> 00:44:32.400
<v Speaker 1>Individuals will have different,</v>

1589
00:44:32.610 --> 00:44:32.821
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1590
00:44:32.821 --> 00:44:33.650
<v Speaker 1>who knows how the,</v>

1591
00:44:33.650 --> 00:44:37.470
<v Speaker 1>but the structure could break and at that point some new system can emerge.</v>

1592
00:44:37.500 --> 00:44:38.030
<v Speaker 1>It's almost,</v>

1593
00:44:38.030 --> 00:44:42.210
<v Speaker 3>that's when we have to bring in the Colombians bringing that fucking Iowasca</v>

1594
00:44:42.510 --> 00:44:46.230
<v Speaker 3>donkeys in big clay pots riding on the back of Don.</v>

1595
00:44:46.231 --> 00:44:48.170
<v Speaker 3>He's in the whole wage.</v>

1596
00:44:50.690 --> 00:44:51.360
<v Speaker 3>Oh Ya,</v>

1597
00:44:51.360 --> 00:44:52.640
<v Speaker 3>Ya go?</v>

1598
00:44:52.690 --> 00:44:53.523
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1599
00:44:54.510 --> 00:44:55.021
<v Speaker 3>You got it,</v>

1600
00:44:55.021 --> 00:44:55.290
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1601
00:44:55.290 --> 00:44:55.500
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1602
00:44:55.500 --> 00:44:56.071
<v Speaker 3>I can get in there,</v>

1603
00:44:56.071 --> 00:44:56.430
<v Speaker 3>dude.</v>

1604
00:44:56.430 --> 00:44:57.120
<v Speaker 3>I could get down.</v>

1605
00:44:57.120 --> 00:44:58.550
<v Speaker 3>I can get done with the Iwatch carols.</v>

1606
00:44:58.900 --> 00:44:59.500
<v Speaker 3>You Cut.</v>

1607
00:44:59.500 --> 00:45:01.080
<v Speaker 3>So what'd they say about smoking DMT?</v>

1608
00:45:01.081 --> 00:45:01.860
<v Speaker 3>Would they say?</v>

1609
00:45:01.860 --> 00:45:02.041
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1610
00:45:02.041 --> 00:45:02.550
<v Speaker 3>they said that</v>

1611
00:45:02.550 --> 00:45:03.660
<v Speaker 1>that's just kind of a,</v>

1612
00:45:03.720 --> 00:45:07.680
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of a rocket ship that plants you right in that it right in that sixth</v>

1613
00:45:07.681 --> 00:45:08.190
<v Speaker 1>dimension,</v>

1614
00:45:08.190 --> 00:45:09.450
<v Speaker 1>but only the sixth dimension.</v>

1615
00:45:10.390 --> 00:45:11.280
<v Speaker 1>The seventh and the eighth,</v>

1616
00:45:11.700 --> 00:45:12.780
<v Speaker 1>they say mostly.</v>

1617
00:45:12.781 --> 00:45:15.600
<v Speaker 1>Mostly not because it's too short of an experience.</v>

1618
00:45:15.601 --> 00:45:16.434
<v Speaker 1>You can't really,</v>

1619
00:45:16.560 --> 00:45:19.050
<v Speaker 1>you have to kind of gather steam through the,</v>

1620
00:45:19.230 --> 00:45:20.850
<v Speaker 1>through the dimensions or something like that.</v>

1621
00:45:21.470 --> 00:45:26.470
<v Speaker 1>And the smoking DMT kind of skips over the fifth where you usually kind of start</v>

1622
00:45:26.581 --> 00:45:27.331
<v Speaker 1>getting in these dreams.</v>

1623
00:45:27.331 --> 00:45:28.290
<v Speaker 1>It's like Wham,</v>

1624
00:45:28.291 --> 00:45:29.340
<v Speaker 1>Bam into the six.</v>

1625
00:45:29.490 --> 00:45:31.730
<v Speaker 1>And that's why they say that there's some disorientation there.</v>

1626
00:45:31.830 --> 00:45:33.660
<v Speaker 1>A lot of lessons to be learned and wisdom.</v>

1627
00:45:33.661 --> 00:45:35.400
<v Speaker 1>Anytime you sneak outside of time,</v>

1628
00:45:35.580 --> 00:45:38.100
<v Speaker 1>which is how they describe it as sneaking outside of time,</v>

1629
00:45:38.430 --> 00:45:39.570
<v Speaker 1>you have lessons to learn,</v>

1630
00:45:39.571 --> 00:45:40.770
<v Speaker 1>but they're,</v>

1631
00:45:40.771 --> 00:45:41.011
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1632
00:45:41.011 --> 00:45:44.070
<v Speaker 1>once you're there you have a short window of time and you're trying to absorb as</v>

1633
00:45:44.071 --> 00:45:45.000
<v Speaker 1>much as possible.</v>

1634
00:45:45.220 --> 00:45:45.510
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1635
00:45:45.510 --> 00:45:47.580
<v Speaker 1>but the forces aren't there to align you to help,</v>

1636
00:45:47.740 --> 00:45:47.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1637
00:45:47.970 --> 00:45:49.670
<v Speaker 1>kind of push you farther because that's,</v>

1638
00:45:49.890 --> 00:45:51.960
<v Speaker 1>that's a process you have to gain knowledge.</v>

1639
00:45:52.140 --> 00:45:53.040
<v Speaker 1>Like what happened to me,</v>

1640
00:45:53.041 --> 00:45:56.970
<v Speaker 1>I had to download something or whatever they said in the seventh to get,</v>

1641
00:45:56.971 --> 00:45:57.181
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1642
00:45:57.181 --> 00:45:57.931
<v Speaker 1>to get that far.</v>

1643
00:45:57.931 --> 00:45:58.261
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

1644
00:45:58.261 --> 00:46:01.020
<v Speaker 1>just have more steam and energy to get there.</v>

1645
00:46:01.021 --> 00:46:02.190
<v Speaker 1>And they talk about it as fuel.</v>

1646
00:46:02.610 --> 00:46:03.210
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1647
00:46:03.210 --> 00:46:06.540
<v Speaker 1>the problem with the smoking DMT is the fuel runs out.</v>

1648
00:46:06.570 --> 00:46:09.150
<v Speaker 1>They have enough fuel to like get you into orbit,</v>

1649
00:46:09.420 --> 00:46:09.721
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1650
00:46:09.721 --> 00:46:13.440
<v Speaker 1>but it's not that extra afterburner that's going to come in and shoot you to</v>

1651
00:46:13.441 --> 00:46:15.690
<v Speaker 1>Mars after you're outside of the atmosphere.</v>

1652
00:46:15.720 --> 00:46:16.050
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1653
00:46:16.050 --> 00:46:18.000
<v Speaker 1>eventually it's just going to suck you right back in.</v>

1654
00:46:18.390 --> 00:46:19.470
<v Speaker 1>And so that's what they say.</v>

1655
00:46:19.471 --> 00:46:19.751
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

1656
00:46:19.751 --> 00:46:20.700
<v Speaker 1>the differences</v>

1657
00:46:20.990 --> 00:46:21.570
<v Speaker 3>between those,</v>

1658
00:46:21.570 --> 00:46:25.700
<v Speaker 3>the interesting because the intravenous doses of DMT that like Strassman did in</v>

1659
00:46:25.701 --> 00:46:26.301
<v Speaker 3>those studies,</v>

1660
00:46:26.301 --> 00:46:28.100
<v Speaker 3>those people had 30 minute trips.</v>

1661
00:46:28.760 --> 00:46:29.041
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

1662
00:46:29.041 --> 00:46:30.110
<v Speaker 3>so I wonder if that's enough.</v>

1663
00:46:30.200 --> 00:46:32.660
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if that's a different teacher to a different place.</v>

1664
00:46:32.661 --> 00:46:35.360
<v Speaker 3>I didn't get to ask as opposed to be a more intense experience when it's</v>

1665
00:46:35.361 --> 00:46:36.081
<v Speaker 3>experienced.</v>

1666
00:46:36.081 --> 00:46:36.680
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1667
00:46:36.680 --> 00:46:37.880
<v Speaker 3>when it's done intravenously,</v>

1668
00:46:38.070 --> 00:46:42.740
<v Speaker 3>it's supposed to be more a more in depth and a lot more entities.</v>

1669
00:46:43.010 --> 00:46:43.400
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1670
00:46:43.400 --> 00:46:45.050
<v Speaker 3>A lot more people being uh,</v>

1671
00:46:45.080 --> 00:46:45.590
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1672
00:46:45.590 --> 00:46:48.410
<v Speaker 3>more of what they would describe.</v>

1673
00:46:48.411 --> 00:46:52.040
<v Speaker 3>That sounds remarkably similar to Ufo abduction experiences.</v>

1674
00:46:52.550 --> 00:46:53.210
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1675
00:46:53.210 --> 00:46:56.960
<v Speaker 3>that kind of thing that you're dealing with these physical things in this other</v>

1676
00:46:56.961 --> 00:46:57.794
<v Speaker 3>place.</v>

1677
00:46:58.290 --> 00:46:58.850
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1678
00:46:58.850 --> 00:47:01.550
<v Speaker 3>It's a real fucking symptom of our culture that that shit's all illegal.</v>

1679
00:47:01.610 --> 00:47:02.600
<v Speaker 3>That people can like,</v>

1680
00:47:02.601 --> 00:47:06.350
<v Speaker 3>you can come back and you get so fucked up that you have to change your name and</v>

1681
00:47:06.351 --> 00:47:07.184
<v Speaker 3>it's still illegal.</v>

1682
00:47:07.550 --> 00:47:08.360
<v Speaker 3>It's illegal.</v>

1683
00:47:08.360 --> 00:47:09.160
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1684
00:47:09.160 --> 00:47:09.540
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

1685
00:47:09.540 --> 00:47:10.580
<v Speaker 3>it's really annoying.</v>

1686
00:47:10.820 --> 00:47:13.520
<v Speaker 3>It's really annoying that we're in this fucking nanny state.</v>

1687
00:47:13.900 --> 00:47:16.370
<v Speaker 3>It's shitbag stupid nanny state country.</v>

1688
00:47:17.010 --> 00:47:17.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1689
00:47:17.580 --> 00:47:19.350
<v Speaker 1>Do you find you any side effects at all?</v>

1690
00:47:19.351 --> 00:47:22.740
<v Speaker 1>Like does your mind wander in places over and over again?</v>

1691
00:47:22.770 --> 00:47:23.760
<v Speaker 1>Do you have any different now?</v>

1692
00:47:23.870 --> 00:47:24.703
<v Speaker 1>What was the,</v>

1693
00:47:25.110 --> 00:47:27.330
<v Speaker 1>some of the challenges were just reintegrating,</v>

1694
00:47:27.360 --> 00:47:27.661
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1695
00:47:27.661 --> 00:47:31.360
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of that's just you to this different world and experience different</v>

1696
00:47:31.361 --> 00:47:31.750
<v Speaker 1>things and,</v>

1697
00:47:31.750 --> 00:47:34.870
<v Speaker 1>but do you leave your life on the treadmill running full speed,</v>

1698
00:47:35.080 --> 00:47:35.321
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1699
00:47:35.321 --> 00:47:39.390
<v Speaker 1>And I tried to hop right back the fuck on and I got tripped up and slammed</v>

1700
00:47:39.400 --> 00:47:40.330
<v Speaker 1>against the back wall.</v>

1701
00:47:40.331 --> 00:47:40.780
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

1702
00:47:40.780 --> 00:47:41.800
<v Speaker 1>Do you use that analogy?</v>

1703
00:47:41.801 --> 00:47:43.420
<v Speaker 1>Like it's hard to get back,</v>

1704
00:47:43.421 --> 00:47:43.661
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1705
00:47:43.661 --> 00:47:44.590
<v Speaker 1>and hard to find,</v>

1706
00:47:44.920 --> 00:47:47.170
<v Speaker 1>kind of the balance of integrating what,</v>

1707
00:47:47.270 --> 00:47:48.640
<v Speaker 1>what you found out they're not.</v>

1708
00:47:48.641 --> 00:47:49.130
<v Speaker 1>But</v>

1709
00:47:49.130 --> 00:47:53.960
<v Speaker 3>do you guys feel like the world doesn't seem the same when you,</v>

1710
00:47:53.990 --> 00:47:54.830
<v Speaker 3>when you came back,</v>

1711
00:47:54.831 --> 00:47:57.680
<v Speaker 3>do you feel that anything's changed in the world?</v>

1712
00:47:58.060 --> 00:47:58.510
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1713
00:47:58.510 --> 00:47:58.871
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1714
00:47:58.871 --> 00:47:59.121
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1715
00:47:59.121 --> 00:47:59.880
<v Speaker 1>I feel like,</v>

1716
00:47:59.880 --> 00:48:00.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1717
00:48:00.160 --> 00:48:00.993
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

1718
00:48:01.030 --> 00:48:04.150
<v Speaker 1>I've changed the way I look at things has changed.</v>

1719
00:48:04.151 --> 00:48:04.451
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1720
00:48:04.451 --> 00:48:05.440
<v Speaker 1>the fact that I can,</v>

1721
00:48:05.470 --> 00:48:09.430
<v Speaker 1>I view myself now more like a needle piercing a nine layered onion.</v>

1722
00:48:09.700 --> 00:48:10.001
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1723
00:48:10.001 --> 00:48:10.540
<v Speaker 1>and I'm,</v>

1724
00:48:10.540 --> 00:48:12.520
<v Speaker 1>you're consciously aware of the first four,</v>

1725
00:48:12.610 --> 00:48:13.391
<v Speaker 1>four layers,</v>

1726
00:48:13.391 --> 00:48:13.601
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1727
00:48:13.601 --> 00:48:14.590
<v Speaker 1>that part of the needle,</v>

1728
00:48:14.710 --> 00:48:18.640
<v Speaker 1>but you're still connected to another five layers above you and you're just,</v>

1729
00:48:18.820 --> 00:48:19.960
<v Speaker 1>you just don't see it,</v>

1730
00:48:20.140 --> 00:48:20.351
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1731
00:48:20.351 --> 00:48:23.320
<v Speaker 1>just that very thought alone has changed,</v>

1732
00:48:23.590 --> 00:48:24.580
<v Speaker 1>has changed my life.</v>

1733
00:48:24.610 --> 00:48:24.970
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1734
00:48:24.970 --> 00:48:28.270
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to incorporate in every day and everyday things.</v>

1735
00:48:28.271 --> 00:48:28.481
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1736
00:48:28.481 --> 00:48:32.620
<v Speaker 1>I've been focused pretty much solely on launching Alpha brain and making sure</v>

1737
00:48:32.621 --> 00:48:34.330
<v Speaker 1>that all goes well and it's been very,</v>

1738
00:48:34.640 --> 00:48:35.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1739
00:48:35.140 --> 00:48:36.160
<v Speaker 1>very focused on that.</v>

1740
00:48:36.161 --> 00:48:37.960
<v Speaker 1>But in my quiet moments,</v>

1741
00:48:37.961 --> 00:48:38.171
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1742
00:48:38.171 --> 00:48:39.100
<v Speaker 1>when I can meditate,</v>

1743
00:48:39.101 --> 00:48:41.020
<v Speaker 1>I can think back and think,</v>

1744
00:48:41.140 --> 00:48:41.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1745
00:48:41.470 --> 00:48:44.920
<v Speaker 1>what I want to do next time I go down there and what lessons I could learn and</v>

1746
00:48:45.220 --> 00:48:45.570
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>

1747
00:48:45.570 --> 00:48:45.800
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1748
00:48:45.800 --> 00:48:47.580
<v Speaker 3>he did an isolation tank son.</v>

1749
00:48:48.060 --> 00:48:49.050
<v Speaker 3>That's your next step.</v>

1750
00:48:49.080 --> 00:48:49.620
<v Speaker 3>I do.</v>

1751
00:48:49.620 --> 00:48:53.680
<v Speaker 3>We sell some of these Alpha brains enough to get you one morning glory.</v>

1752
00:48:53.700 --> 00:48:54.510
<v Speaker 3>And so this is,</v>

1753
00:48:54.510 --> 00:48:57.780
<v Speaker 3>this is the shit that we've been talking about on Twitter and we've talked about</v>

1754
00:48:57.781 --> 00:49:02.040
<v Speaker 3>it on the podcast before and this is a formula that Chris has put together and</v>

1755
00:49:02.041 --> 00:49:04.500
<v Speaker 3>that we're selling and it's called Alpha brain,</v>

1756
00:49:04.590 --> 00:49:07.590
<v Speaker 3>and it fucking does something man.</v>

1757
00:49:07.620 --> 00:49:08.760
<v Speaker 3>It first of all,</v>

1758
00:49:08.761 --> 00:49:13.761
<v Speaker 3>it gives you incredibly vivid dreams and it seems to fire up your brain at a</v>

1759
00:49:14.071 --> 00:49:17.700
<v Speaker 3>higher rpm level or give you some clarity.</v>

1760
00:49:18.240 --> 00:49:21.300
<v Speaker 3>I feel like it helps me form sentences better,</v>

1761
00:49:21.301 --> 00:49:21.570
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

1762
00:49:21.570 --> 00:49:22.403
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying?</v>

1763
00:49:22.500 --> 00:49:22.711
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1764
00:49:22.711 --> 00:49:24.210
<v Speaker 3>I don't know that that's what's doing it,</v>

1765
00:49:24.240 --> 00:49:24.901
<v Speaker 3>but I feel like,</v>

1766
00:49:24.901 --> 00:49:25.231
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

1767
00:49:25.231 --> 00:49:28.200
<v Speaker 3>I'm fucking talking pretty smooth sometimes when I'm on this stuff.</v>

1768
00:49:28.880 --> 00:49:32.840
<v Speaker 1>Technically what they say is that it enhances Sydney synaptic plasticity,</v>

1769
00:49:33.140 --> 00:49:36.800
<v Speaker 1>which is the way that your neurons can kind of fit together and transfer</v>

1770
00:49:36.801 --> 00:49:37.320
<v Speaker 1>information</v>

1771
00:49:37.320 --> 00:49:37.440
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1772
00:49:37.440 --> 00:49:40.110
<v Speaker 3>was this all peer reviewed stuff or is it spiritual?</v>

1773
00:49:40.140 --> 00:49:40.370
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1774
00:49:40.370 --> 00:49:41.880
<v Speaker 3>it's a c rolling.</v>

1775
00:49:42.490 --> 00:49:42.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1776
00:49:42.760 --> 00:49:43.151
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>

1777
00:49:43.151 --> 00:49:45.150
<v Speaker 1>this is purely on the scientific tap here.</v>

1778
00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:45.910
<v Speaker 3>And what's it,</v>

1779
00:49:45.910 --> 00:49:46.600
<v Speaker 3>what's in here?</v>

1780
00:49:46.600 --> 00:49:47.310
<v Speaker 3>So what it is,</v>

1781
00:49:47.310 --> 00:49:47.450
<v Speaker 3>it's</v>

1782
00:49:47.450 --> 00:49:48.570
<v Speaker 1>a GPC calling,</v>

1783
00:49:48.600 --> 00:49:50.110
<v Speaker 1>which is a great form of rock hauling,</v>

1784
00:49:50.460 --> 00:49:51.291
<v Speaker 1>the best form of rock.</v>

1785
00:49:51.291 --> 00:49:55.620
<v Speaker 1>Coleen really glycerophosphocholine easily absorbed through the blood brain</v>

1786
00:49:55.621 --> 00:49:58.140
<v Speaker 1>barrier where some of the other Coline's or not.</v>

1787
00:49:58.350 --> 00:50:01.140
<v Speaker 1>So it's most expensive and best calling for you.</v>

1788
00:50:01.440 --> 00:50:02.970
<v Speaker 1>And then we have hoopers Ia Serrata,</v>

1789
00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:05.550
<v Speaker 1>which has a proven compound called huperzine a,</v>

1790
00:50:05.850 --> 00:50:10.440
<v Speaker 1>which is an Acetylcholine esterase inhibitor and that prevents the breakdown of</v>

1791
00:50:10.441 --> 00:50:11.790
<v Speaker 1>the Acetylcholine in your brain.</v>

1792
00:50:12.090 --> 00:50:15.000
<v Speaker 1>And what does see the calling is in charge of is in charge of,</v>

1793
00:50:15.170 --> 00:50:15.421
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1794
00:50:15.421 --> 00:50:16.021
<v Speaker 1>focus,</v>

1795
00:50:16.021 --> 00:50:16.530
<v Speaker 1>memory,</v>

1796
00:50:16.530 --> 00:50:16.981
<v Speaker 1>memory,</v>

1797
00:50:16.981 --> 00:50:17.814
<v Speaker 1>clarity,</v>

1798
00:50:17.820 --> 00:50:17.971
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1799
00:50:17.971 --> 00:50:19.260
<v Speaker 1>all the Alzheimer's treatments.</v>

1800
00:50:19.261 --> 00:50:23.910
<v Speaker 1>Currently almost all of them focus on rehabilitating your acetylcholine levels</v>

1801
00:50:23.911 --> 00:50:25.110
<v Speaker 1>in boosting your acetylcholine.</v>

1802
00:50:25.290 --> 00:50:26.820
<v Speaker 1>So even who presented a,</v>

1803
00:50:26.821 --> 00:50:30.320
<v Speaker 1>which is part of the Hoop Herzliya Serrata has been tested in that capacity.</v>

1804
00:50:30.321 --> 00:50:31.760
<v Speaker 1>So this is all very,</v>

1805
00:50:31.970 --> 00:50:32.151
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1806
00:50:32.151 --> 00:50:33.500
<v Speaker 1>very scientifically proven.</v>

1807
00:50:33.501 --> 00:50:36.890
<v Speaker 1>This is not anything Hokey pokey is just the fact hire a pseudo cdot.</v>

1808
00:50:36.890 --> 00:50:38.030
<v Speaker 1>Coleen levels lead to this.</v>

1809
00:50:38.240 --> 00:50:40.550
<v Speaker 1>Now the problem with higher acetylcholine levels,</v>

1810
00:50:40.670 --> 00:50:44.060
<v Speaker 1>otherwise everybody would just be jacked jacking their acetylcholine up,</v>

1811
00:50:44.450 --> 00:50:47.090
<v Speaker 1>is it can lead to anxiety,</v>

1812
00:50:47.091 --> 00:50:48.080
<v Speaker 1>anxiousness,</v>

1813
00:50:48.230 --> 00:50:49.370
<v Speaker 1>a short temper.</v>

1814
00:50:49.490 --> 00:50:50.930
<v Speaker 1>If that's too out of balance,</v>

1815
00:50:51.530 --> 00:50:52.190
<v Speaker 1>you can get other,</v>

1816
00:50:52.190 --> 00:50:53.810
<v Speaker 1>you can get kind of hyper aware.</v>

1817
00:50:54.110 --> 00:50:55.540
<v Speaker 1>And so what I did with this formula,</v>

1818
00:50:55.550 --> 00:50:55.941
<v Speaker 1>as I said,</v>

1819
00:50:55.941 --> 00:50:56.330
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

1820
00:50:56.330 --> 00:50:58.550
<v Speaker 1>we want to have strong acetylcholine.</v>

1821
00:50:58.580 --> 00:50:59.120
<v Speaker 1>It's good,</v>

1822
00:50:59.120 --> 00:50:59.901
<v Speaker 1>it helps your memory,</v>

1823
00:50:59.901 --> 00:51:00.980
<v Speaker 1>helps your mental drives,</v>

1824
00:51:00.981 --> 00:51:01.850
<v Speaker 1>help you focus.</v>

1825
00:51:02.060 --> 00:51:04.370
<v Speaker 1>But we don't want to have all the other things.</v>

1826
00:51:04.371 --> 00:51:08.720
<v Speaker 1>So I created a balanced formula and I included things like Gabba which controls</v>

1827
00:51:08.721 --> 00:51:13.610
<v Speaker 1>kind of relaxation and kind of calm and mental clarity in that kind of calm</v>

1828
00:51:13.611 --> 00:51:14.120
<v Speaker 1>state.</v>

1829
00:51:14.120 --> 00:51:14.960
<v Speaker 1>And then dopamine,</v>

1830
00:51:14.961 --> 00:51:18.290
<v Speaker 1>which handles a lot of your movement activities and some of your mental energy</v>

1831
00:51:18.291 --> 00:51:18.861
<v Speaker 1>activities.</v>

1832
00:51:18.861 --> 00:51:19.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1833
00:51:19.010 --> 00:51:19.970
<v Speaker 1>added dopamine.</v>

1834
00:51:20.030 --> 00:51:20.510
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1835
00:51:20.510 --> 00:51:20.990
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1836
00:51:20.990 --> 00:51:22.920
<v Speaker 1>it's Mucuna pruriens uh,</v>

1837
00:51:23.030 --> 00:51:26.750
<v Speaker 1>contains a standardized dose of 50% ELL Dopa and um,</v>

1838
00:51:26.751 --> 00:51:27.320
<v Speaker 1>you can appear.</v>

1839
00:51:27.320 --> 00:51:28.180
<v Speaker 1>Ends is a herb,</v>

1840
00:51:28.190 --> 00:51:28.540
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

1841
00:51:28.540 --> 00:51:29.570
<v Speaker 1>believe it grows in India.</v>

1842
00:51:29.840 --> 00:51:34.160
<v Speaker 1>And so the 50% standardized l Dopa is the building block for dopamine.</v>

1843
00:51:34.161 --> 00:51:34.791
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

1844
00:51:34.791 --> 00:51:35.900
<v Speaker 1>I didn't add dopamine.</v>

1845
00:51:35.901 --> 00:51:36.320
<v Speaker 1>I actually,</v>

1846
00:51:36.320 --> 00:51:39.980
<v Speaker 1>you're able to add a Gabba directly because they're able to extract it from a</v>

1847
00:51:39.981 --> 00:51:40.814
<v Speaker 1>plant.</v>

1848
00:51:40.940 --> 00:51:42.740
<v Speaker 1>But the dopamine you have to get through,</v>

1849
00:51:42.860 --> 00:51:43.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1850
00:51:43.490 --> 00:51:45.020
<v Speaker 1>pushing l Dopa and your body,</v>

1851
00:51:45.021 --> 00:51:46.250
<v Speaker 1>your body will destroy it opened me.</v>

1852
00:51:46.251 --> 00:51:49.640
<v Speaker 1>And if you try to put it in directly so you build it yourself with El Dopa,</v>

1853
00:51:49.820 --> 00:51:50.070
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1854
00:51:50.070 --> 00:51:51.620
<v Speaker 1>the catalyst and that is again,</v>

1855
00:51:51.830 --> 00:51:52.310
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1856
00:51:52.310 --> 00:51:53.600
<v Speaker 1>the pyridoxine Hcl,</v>

1857
00:51:53.601 --> 00:51:55.490
<v Speaker 1>vitamin B six which we have in there,</v>

1858
00:51:55.491 --> 00:51:56.390
<v Speaker 1>which helps convert it.</v>

1859
00:51:56.780 --> 00:51:57.111
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1860
00:51:57.111 --> 00:51:57.441
<v Speaker 1>and then,</v>

1861
00:51:57.441 --> 00:52:00.500
<v Speaker 1>then I've just put a ton of antioxidants that are going to give you energy,</v>

1862
00:52:00.670 --> 00:52:00.830
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1863
00:52:00.830 --> 00:52:01.760
<v Speaker 1>help your focus.</v>

1864
00:52:01.790 --> 00:52:05.670
<v Speaker 1>The ACA 11 in there that was shown to actually repair DNA and uh,</v>

1865
00:52:05.810 --> 00:52:07.520
<v Speaker 1>scientific peer reviewed studies.</v>

1866
00:52:07.610 --> 00:52:11.780
<v Speaker 1>So really fucking strong antioxidants going to kind of eliminate some of that</v>

1867
00:52:11.781 --> 00:52:12.471
<v Speaker 1>mental fog,</v>

1868
00:52:12.471 --> 00:52:17.150
<v Speaker 1>cleared out some of your free radicals and then allow the acetylcholine a boost</v>

1869
00:52:17.210 --> 00:52:19.130
<v Speaker 1>to be manageable by the other,</v>

1870
00:52:19.160 --> 00:52:20.300
<v Speaker 1>by the other components.</v>

1871
00:52:20.980 --> 00:52:21.111
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1872
00:52:21.111 --> 00:52:23.240
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever thought about adding five HTP to it?</v>

1873
00:52:23.510 --> 00:52:28.100
<v Speaker 1>Now that's another formula that I have and Serotonin is a crucial component.</v>

1874
00:52:28.101 --> 00:52:30.530
<v Speaker 1>Five HTP is the direct building block of Serotonin.</v>

1875
00:52:30.690 --> 00:52:31.090
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1876
00:52:31.090 --> 00:52:33.110
<v Speaker 1>it goes l Tryptophan to five HTP,</v>

1877
00:52:33.290 --> 00:52:36.320
<v Speaker 1>five ht HTP then converts to five ht,</v>

1878
00:52:36.350 --> 00:52:37.280
<v Speaker 1>which is serotonin.</v>

1879
00:52:37.520 --> 00:52:38.720
<v Speaker 1>That's the fourth component.</v>

1880
00:52:38.930 --> 00:52:40.400
<v Speaker 1>I have another separate formula,</v>

1881
00:52:40.401 --> 00:52:41.330
<v Speaker 1>the rollover formula,</v>

1882
00:52:41.331 --> 00:52:44.600
<v Speaker 1>which is specifically focused on building serotonin.</v>

1883
00:52:44.750 --> 00:52:45.460
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1884
00:52:45.460 --> 00:52:45.710
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1885
00:52:45.710 --> 00:52:47.330
<v Speaker 1>being the fact that I have that there,</v>

1886
00:52:47.360 --> 00:52:51.320
<v Speaker 1>there's just not that much room in the capsules and it is important to have,</v>

1887
00:52:51.470 --> 00:52:52.580
<v Speaker 1>but I recommend that,</v>

1888
00:52:52.790 --> 00:52:53.360
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1889
00:52:53.360 --> 00:52:53.571
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1890
00:52:53.571 --> 00:52:55.130
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't tend to,</v>

1891
00:52:56.080 --> 00:52:59.300
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't need to be so much in balance for this formula to work,</v>

1892
00:52:59.301 --> 00:53:00.800
<v Speaker 1>but it is a crucial part of things.</v>

1893
00:53:00.801 --> 00:53:04.520
<v Speaker 1>So I recommend either taking my formula or another form of five HTP,</v>

1894
00:53:04.521 --> 00:53:09.410
<v Speaker 1>but it was just a little bit much to fit and efficacious dose of five HTP in</v>

1895
00:53:09.411 --> 00:53:11.700
<v Speaker 1>this Alpha brain to bring that forth component.</v>

1896
00:53:11.760 --> 00:53:11.990
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

1897
00:53:11.990 --> 00:53:15.020
<v Speaker 1>that's too bad because I know a lot of people that have had a lot of positive</v>

1898
00:53:15.021 --> 00:53:16.490
<v Speaker 1>effects with the five HTP is great.</v>

1899
00:53:16.491 --> 00:53:19.340
<v Speaker 1>That's why I have a whole product rowboat and roll over,</v>

1900
00:53:19.341 --> 00:53:19.950
<v Speaker 1>roll over.</v>

1901
00:53:19.950 --> 00:53:20.151
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1902
00:53:20.151 --> 00:53:23.180
<v Speaker 1>My product rollover is dedicated specifically to that.</v>

1903
00:53:23.181 --> 00:53:23.660
<v Speaker 1>So you have a,</v>

1904
00:53:23.660 --> 00:53:26.040
<v Speaker 1>you're selling those and much smaller selling</v>

1905
00:53:26.040 --> 00:53:27.460
<v Speaker 3>like four of those bottles,</v>

1906
00:53:27.470 --> 00:53:29.430
<v Speaker 3>a 30 get bottles of 30 just like this.</v>

1907
00:53:29.460 --> 00:53:30.030
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1908
00:53:30.030 --> 00:53:31.920
<v Speaker 3>And so do you recommend people taking that?</v>

1909
00:53:31.921 --> 00:53:33.090
<v Speaker 3>If they're not coming off of,</v>

1910
00:53:33.091 --> 00:53:33.390
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1911
00:53:33.390 --> 00:53:33.691
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1912
00:53:33.691 --> 00:53:34.800
<v Speaker 3>the roll on roll off,</v>

1913
00:53:34.801 --> 00:53:38.720
<v Speaker 3>it's supposed to be like you do Mtma and then you're welcome anytime.</v>

1914
00:53:39.370 --> 00:53:40.300
<v Speaker 1>If you're not sleeping,</v>

1915
00:53:40.330 --> 00:53:41.770
<v Speaker 1>if you're stressed and you're not sleeping,</v>

1916
00:53:41.771 --> 00:53:44.140
<v Speaker 1>that's when Serotonin is produced is when you're sleeping.</v>

1917
00:53:44.380 --> 00:53:45.550
<v Speaker 1>So if you're not sleeping,</v>

1918
00:53:45.580 --> 00:53:47.650
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter if you're partying and if you are doing,</v>

1919
00:53:47.680 --> 00:53:48.700
<v Speaker 1>doing whatever you're doing,</v>

1920
00:53:48.940 --> 00:53:50.770
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to be producing enough serotonin.</v>

1921
00:53:50.860 --> 00:53:51.071
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1922
00:53:51.071 --> 00:53:52.570
<v Speaker 1>So that's when you need to take it.</v>

1923
00:53:52.770 --> 00:53:52.891
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1924
00:53:52.891 --> 00:53:53.381
<v Speaker 1>so yeah,</v>

1925
00:53:53.381 --> 00:53:56.020
<v Speaker 1>I certainly recommend taking it as part of the regimen.</v>

1926
00:53:56.080 --> 00:53:59.440
<v Speaker 1>I mean that formula will probably change a little bit and the next iteration I</v>

1927
00:53:59.441 --> 00:54:00.490
<v Speaker 1>have some ideas for it,</v>

1928
00:54:00.640 --> 00:54:04.150
<v Speaker 1>but I'm going to always have a serotonin specific formula.</v>

1929
00:54:04.420 --> 00:54:04.990
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1930
00:54:04.990 --> 00:54:05.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1931
00:54:05.410 --> 00:54:05.591
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

1932
00:54:05.591 --> 00:54:09.820
<v Speaker 1>if enough people want to have this Alpha brain be that complete brain thing,</v>

1933
00:54:09.970 --> 00:54:10.840
<v Speaker 1>we can look at it.</v>

1934
00:54:10.841 --> 00:54:13.270
<v Speaker 1>But just as far as dose and capsule size,</v>

1935
00:54:13.271 --> 00:54:14.530
<v Speaker 1>it's difficult to do everything.</v>

1936
00:54:14.680 --> 00:54:14.921
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1937
00:54:14.921 --> 00:54:18.040
<v Speaker 1>I have a capsule that's specifically designed for Serotonin,</v>

1938
00:54:18.070 --> 00:54:19.480
<v Speaker 1>the whole capsule capsule.</v>

1939
00:54:19.540 --> 00:54:20.560
<v Speaker 1>It'd be way too much.</v>

1940
00:54:20.680 --> 00:54:21.370
<v Speaker 1>It's tough.</v>

1941
00:54:21.370 --> 00:54:21.731
<v Speaker 1>It's tough.</v>

1942
00:54:21.731 --> 00:54:21.971
<v Speaker 1>So you,</v>

1943
00:54:21.971 --> 00:54:25.300
<v Speaker 1>so that one was something that I do recommend I do sell on,</v>

1944
00:54:25.301 --> 00:54:26.051
<v Speaker 1>on at.com,</v>

1945
00:54:26.051 --> 00:54:26.550
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

1946
00:54:26.550 --> 00:54:26.920
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1947
00:54:26.920 --> 00:54:28.090
<v Speaker 1>it's not in the Alpha brain,</v>

1948
00:54:28.091 --> 00:54:29.350
<v Speaker 1>but I highly recommend it.</v>

1949
00:54:29.351 --> 00:54:29.831
<v Speaker 1>It's a great,</v>

1950
00:54:29.831 --> 00:54:30.790
<v Speaker 1>it's a great thing to have.</v>

1951
00:54:30.930 --> 00:54:31.860
<v Speaker 4>I use it all the time.</v>

1952
00:54:31.861 --> 00:54:32.400
<v Speaker 4>I love it.</v>

1953
00:54:32.400 --> 00:54:33.900
<v Speaker 4>I don't take it every day,</v>

1954
00:54:33.901 --> 00:54:37.470
<v Speaker 4>but I definitely take it on like days where I for sure feel jacked up in it.</v>

1955
00:54:37.560 --> 00:54:38.590
<v Speaker 4>I think I,</v>

1956
00:54:38.730 --> 00:54:39.481
<v Speaker 4>I've been taking for like,</v>

1957
00:54:39.481 --> 00:54:39.781
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

1958
00:54:39.781 --> 00:54:40.350
<v Speaker 4>like six,</v>

1959
00:54:40.350 --> 00:54:41.790
<v Speaker 4>eight months here and there and I,</v>

1960
00:54:41.791 --> 00:54:41.970
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1961
00:54:41.970 --> 00:54:42.840
<v Speaker 4>it's one of my favorite things.</v>

1962
00:54:42.841 --> 00:54:45.300
<v Speaker 4>I though the roll on and roll overs are my two favorite things.</v>

1963
00:54:45.380 --> 00:54:45.561
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1964
00:54:45.561 --> 00:54:45.801
<v Speaker 1>Those,</v>

1965
00:54:45.801 --> 00:54:48.230
<v Speaker 1>so those formulas will change a little bit,</v>

1966
00:54:48.231 --> 00:54:51.560
<v Speaker 1>but I'm still going to always keep that kind of concept and not,</v>

1967
00:54:51.800 --> 00:54:51.981
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1968
00:54:51.981 --> 00:54:52.814
<v Speaker 1>the Alpha brains,</v>

1969
00:54:52.820 --> 00:54:54.140
<v Speaker 1>it's getting great feedback.</v>

1970
00:54:54.141 --> 00:54:54.420
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

1971
00:54:54.420 --> 00:54:54.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1972
00:54:54.800 --> 00:54:55.491
<v Speaker 1>all of us here,</v>

1973
00:54:55.491 --> 00:54:56.630
<v Speaker 1>we all take it and we dig it.</v>

1974
00:54:56.631 --> 00:54:56.910
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1975
00:54:56.910 --> 00:54:57.180
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1976
00:54:57.180 --> 00:54:58.500
<v Speaker 3>there's something going on with it.</v>

1977
00:54:59.400 --> 00:55:01.110
<v Speaker 3>Most certainly does have an effect.</v>

1978
00:55:01.200 --> 00:55:02.033
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1979
00:55:02.040 --> 00:55:02.581
<v Speaker 3>like I said,</v>

1980
00:55:02.581 --> 00:55:04.230
<v Speaker 3>it gives me the most incredible dreams.</v>

1981
00:55:04.300 --> 00:55:04.510
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1982
00:55:04.510 --> 00:55:08.290
<v Speaker 1>So the reason why that's happening is acetylcholine regulates rem sleep.</v>

1983
00:55:08.530 --> 00:55:09.610
<v Speaker 1>That's what determines,</v>

1984
00:55:09.640 --> 00:55:09.911
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1985
00:55:09.911 --> 00:55:11.560
<v Speaker 1>you get a wash of Acetylcholine,</v>

1986
00:55:11.790 --> 00:55:12.130
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1987
00:55:12.130 --> 00:55:13.390
<v Speaker 1>during your rem sleep.</v>

1988
00:55:13.540 --> 00:55:17.950
<v Speaker 1>So the fact that you have excess surpluses of Acetylcholine created by the GPC</v>

1989
00:55:17.951 --> 00:55:22.951
<v Speaker 1>calling her Perseus serrata allows a deeper and broader wash of Acetylcholine to</v>

1990
00:55:23.771 --> 00:55:24.604
<v Speaker 1>go through,</v>

1991
00:55:24.760 --> 00:55:25.120
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1992
00:55:25.120 --> 00:55:26.020
<v Speaker 1>your sleep cycles.</v>

1993
00:55:26.021 --> 00:55:29.110
<v Speaker 1>And so your rem sleep becomes way more intense,</v>

1994
00:55:29.140 --> 00:55:31.540
<v Speaker 1>longer and more vivid then,</v>

1995
00:55:31.630 --> 00:55:31.900
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1996
00:55:31.900 --> 00:55:33.550
<v Speaker 1>when you do have low levels of Acetylcholine.</v>

1997
00:55:33.650 --> 00:55:33.931
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>

1998
00:55:33.931 --> 00:55:35.460
<v Speaker 3>so if you guys want to grab this,</v>

2055
00:57:14.850 --> 00:57:16.380
<v Speaker 3>It's in the roads in the sacred valley.</v>

2056
00:57:16.381 --> 00:57:18.890
<v Speaker 3>I forget the name of this actual ruin site,</v>

2057
00:57:18.940 --> 00:57:19.773
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

00:57:20.941 --> 00:57:21.774
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2061
00:57:22.410 --> 00:57:22.601
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2062
00:57:22.601 --> 00:57:24.120
<v Speaker 3>it was right there near,</v>

2063
00:57:24.121 --> 00:57:24.740
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2064
00:57:24.740 --> 00:57:24.960
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2065
00:57:24.960 --> 00:57:27.700
<v Speaker 3>it's outside of Cusco by about an hour and a half and you get to these ruin</v>

2066
00:57:27.701 --> 00:57:28.050
<v Speaker 3>sites.</v>

2067
00:57:28.050 --> 00:57:28.620
<v Speaker 3>Either way,</v>

2068
00:57:28.620 --> 00:57:29.520
<v Speaker 3>it's dope.</v>

2069
00:57:30.180 --> 00:57:31.680
<v Speaker 3>Go get some Alpha brain stupid.</v>

2070
00:57:32.580 --> 00:57:32.881
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2071
00:57:32.881 --> 00:57:36.430
<v Speaker 3>It does seem like one of the places too bad he can't do Iowasca there.</v>

2072
00:57:37.020 --> 00:57:38.310
<v Speaker 3>That would be the shit.</v>

2073
00:57:38.370 --> 00:57:38.611
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2074
00:57:38.611 --> 00:57:43.611
<v Speaker 3>I think that sounds fucking bad ass do Iowasca at Chichen Itza or Machu Picchu</v>

2075
00:57:44.461 --> 00:57:45.140
<v Speaker 3>or something like that.</v>

2076
00:57:45.140 --> 00:57:45.450
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2077
00:57:45.450 --> 00:57:47.520
<v Speaker 3>At the ruins of some ancient civilization.</v>

2078
00:57:47.521 --> 00:57:48.180
<v Speaker 3>That that's what they,</v>

2079
00:57:48.180 --> 00:57:51.000
<v Speaker 3>that's what they develop Machu Picchu for as a spiritual center.</v>

2080
00:57:51.090 --> 00:57:54.150
<v Speaker 3>Actually really it wasn't like a political center.</v>

2081
00:57:54.180 --> 00:57:55.500
<v Speaker 3>This was their spiritual home.</v>

2082
00:57:55.610 --> 00:57:56.221
<v Speaker 3>Where did you hear that?</v>

2083
00:57:56.221 --> 00:57:57.000
<v Speaker 3>The rituals?</v>

2084
00:57:57.000 --> 00:57:57.121
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2085
00:57:57.121 --> 00:58:01.230
<v Speaker 3>the people there for me cause I thought the cause modern Western folks have no</v>

2086
00:58:01.231 --> 00:58:02.640
<v Speaker 3>fucking idea why it was created.</v>

2087
00:58:02.641 --> 00:58:03.480
<v Speaker 3>They don't have an idea.</v>

2088
00:58:03.540 --> 00:58:03.761
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2089
00:58:03.761 --> 00:58:05.490
<v Speaker 3>he had the Shaman Saul say this was there,</v>

2090
00:58:05.491 --> 00:58:07.860
<v Speaker 3>this was created as their spiritual home and that's,</v>

2091
00:58:07.861 --> 00:58:09.930
<v Speaker 3>and that's why they created it in such an odd spot.</v>

2092
00:58:09.931 --> 00:58:11.100
<v Speaker 3>The way that the mountains are around.</v>

2093
00:58:11.110 --> 00:58:13.650
<v Speaker 3>There's speaking of law civilizations,</v>

2094
00:58:13.651 --> 00:58:14.820
