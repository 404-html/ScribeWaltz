15
00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.840
<v Speaker 1>One of the great accomplishments of my </v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

16
00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:05.110
<v Speaker 1>There's videos out there exposing me as </v>
<v Speaker 1>a satanist pink is Duncan was performing</v>

17
00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.900
<v Speaker 1>at this guy's wedding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was Anton Levay son,</v>

18
00:01:11.901 --> 00:01:13.800
<v Speaker 1>grandson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>grandson standing.</v>

19
00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was getting married to Zahn Dora </v>

20
00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.790
<v Speaker 1>Olivier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

21
00:01:19.791 --> 00:01:22.310
<v Speaker 1>he found out that I did a satanic pop it</v>
<v Speaker 1>act.</v>

22
00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.780
<v Speaker 1>So he had me come and do I say tannic </v>
<v Speaker 1>puppet act.</v>

23
00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:30.790
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I told you I was doing it and asked if </v>

24
00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:30.790
<v Speaker 1>he wanted to come.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you were like,</v>

25
00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:30.830
<v Speaker 1>fuck yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to come.</v>

26
00:01:30.831 --> 00:01:32.690
<v Speaker 1>How often do you get to go to the state?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tannic wedding.</v>

27
00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:34.910
<v Speaker 1>It was pretty ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was awesome though.</v>

28
00:01:34.911 --> 00:01:37.460
<v Speaker 1>I met Dave Foley's wife.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

29
00:01:37.461 --> 00:01:38.060
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hi.</v>

30
00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.320
<v Speaker 1>How are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was,</v>

31
00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.060
<v Speaker 1>she was involved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was dancing,</v>

32
00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.570
<v Speaker 1>doing something there at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a really fun party.</v>

33
00:01:44.571 --> 00:01:47.660
<v Speaker 1>Man was all tongue in cheek.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All hilarious,</v>

34
00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.810
<v Speaker 1>all fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was no real Satan love and go on </v>

35
00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.171
<v Speaker 1>their folks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think people understand that about </v>

36
00:01:56.171 --> 00:01:56.370
<v Speaker 1>satanism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

37
00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.840
<v Speaker 1>don't get that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea behind it for these people,</v>

38
00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:04.900
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not endorsing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the idea behind it is to just live </v>

39
00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.280
<v Speaker 1>like sort of pleasurably.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have Fun,</v>

40
00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.460
<v Speaker 1>indulge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>live your life like that.</v>

41
00:02:10.461 --> 00:02:13.700
<v Speaker 1>It's more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's more of the idea and fuck up your</v>

42
00:02:13.701 --> 00:02:15.290
<v Speaker 1>enemy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck up your enemies.</v>

43
00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:17.120
<v Speaker 1>Don't leave that one out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What part is that?</v>

44
00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.730
<v Speaker 1>While that's the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's like the.</v>

45
00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.950
<v Speaker 1>That's a part of it that you're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So basically you're looking at a </v>

46
00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.520
<v Speaker 1>reflection of Christianity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christianity,</v>

47
00:02:28.521 --> 00:02:32.610
<v Speaker 1>ultimate surrender to the universe </v>
<v Speaker 1>through love.</v>

48
00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.870
<v Speaker 1>You lose yourself and love you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Turn the other cheek.</v>

49
00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.930
<v Speaker 1>Carrier Enemies Code.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Forgive your trespasses.</v>

50
00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:44.380
<v Speaker 1>That's Christianity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So satanism is no,</v>

51
00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.660
<v Speaker 1>I'm not turning the other cheek.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When is that ever been</v>

52
00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:52.730
<v Speaker 2>fucking work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're advising me to turn the other </v>

53
00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.951
<v Speaker 2>cheek in a universe where nature is </v>
<v Speaker 2>constantly devouring itself.</v>

54
00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:56.700
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>turn the other cheek.</v>

55
00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.010
<v Speaker 1>Turn the other cheek against a tiger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You recommend that</v>

56
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.830
<v Speaker 3>when a tiger is attacking me or do I </v>
<v Speaker 3>fight back?</v>

57
00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:05.260
<v Speaker 3>Am I like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>am I going to be like ps,</v>

58
00:03:05.261 --> 00:03:07.840
<v Speaker 3>not a satanist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm way more on the love side of things.</v>

59
00:03:07.841 --> 00:03:08.640
<v Speaker 3>I'm just embodying</v>

60
00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.120
<v Speaker 2>the voice of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But are you fucking kidding me?</v>

61
00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:15.890
<v Speaker 2>Are like the letter Gandhi road to uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to a Hitler,</v>

62
00:03:15.891 --> 00:03:18.770
<v Speaker 2>to Churchill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wrote all these letters.</v>

63
00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.760
<v Speaker 3>Sandy wrote these letters and they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>very sweet.</v>

64
00:03:20.761 --> 00:03:23.460
<v Speaker 3>Like you wrote a letter to Hitler,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very sweet letter to Hitler.</v>

65
00:03:23.461 --> 00:03:28.461
<v Speaker 3>That's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're the only person on earth who can </v>

66
00:03:28.461 --> 00:03:30.000
<v Speaker 3>stop this incredible thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Awful thing that's about to happen.</v>

67
00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:35.270
<v Speaker 3>So maybe don't incinerate all the Jews </v>
<v Speaker 3>and kill everybody in Hitler probably.</v>

68
00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.730
<v Speaker 3>I guarantee Hillar called his friend </v>
<v Speaker 3>over and it's like,</v>

69
00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:40.470
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gandhi road,</v>

70
00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.260
<v Speaker 3>this stupid fucking letter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh sure.</v>

71
00:03:43.261 --> 00:03:44.310
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's just stop.</v>

72
00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:45.840
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thanks Gandhi.</v>

73
00:03:45.841 --> 00:03:47.400
<v Speaker 3>Thanks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Skinny bald,</v>

74
00:03:47.401 --> 00:03:52.401
<v Speaker 3>sweet guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll stop conquering the planet because </v>

75
00:03:52.401 --> 00:03:54.300
<v Speaker 3>you wrote a flowery letter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nor does it work.</v>

76
00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:58.680
<v Speaker 3>Did it work to stop World War II know </v>
<v Speaker 3>what worked was the bright,</v>

77
00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:03.710
<v Speaker 3>blinding light of atomic death.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what stopped the wars and so the </v>

78
00:04:04.471 --> 00:04:09.471
<v Speaker 3>satanist would say that's a more </v>
<v Speaker 3>effective tactic when it comes to </v>

79
00:04:09.471 --> 00:04:13.101
<v Speaker 3>dealing with a universe where we are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We are growing through conflict.</v>

80
00:04:13.381 --> 00:04:14.420
<v Speaker 3>Whereas in.</v>

81
00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:19.440
<v Speaker 3>So that's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That would be more along the lines of </v>

82
00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:20.910
<v Speaker 3>Satan is when of course the other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea of indulgence.</v>

83
00:04:20.911 --> 00:04:25.911
<v Speaker 3>Like in the to quote Anton Levay from </v>
<v Speaker 3>the satanic black masses,</v>

84
00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.050
<v Speaker 3>I have become like the beasts of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>field.</v>

85
00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.990
<v Speaker 3>That's something and they're really fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can look it up on youtube.</v>

86
00:04:33.991 --> 00:04:35.220
<v Speaker 3>It's there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you know what?</v>

87
00:04:35.221 --> 00:04:37.860
<v Speaker 3>I have to ask Dan Carlin this because </v>
<v Speaker 3>I've heard this and I don't know if it's</v>

88
00:04:37.861 --> 00:04:42.861
<v Speaker 3>true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I heard that Japan was already willing </v>

89
00:04:42.861 --> 00:04:43.680
<v Speaker 3>to surrender and we were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eh,</v>

90
00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:46.110
<v Speaker 3>not really interested in that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We want to try this shit out.</v>

91
00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:47.580
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've heard that too.</v>

92
00:04:47.581 --> 00:04:51.720
<v Speaker 3>And then I don't know man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a historian as Dan Carlin says.</v>

93
00:04:51.721 --> 00:04:52.920
<v Speaker 3>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's true.</v>

94
00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:56.070
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if he says that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't believe I've heard it from him.</v>

95
00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:01.100
<v Speaker 3>I believe I heard it from someone else </v>
<v Speaker 3>from one of those I heard he had to </v>

96
00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.100
<v Speaker 3>hurt.</v>

97
00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:05.700
<v Speaker 3>I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've seen documentaries on the mindset </v>

98
00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:08.871
<v Speaker 3>of Japan during World War II and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>was a hornets hive in the United States </v>

99
00:05:09.571 --> 00:05:11.970
<v Speaker 3>was like a honey badger shoving.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking,</v>

100
00:05:11.971 --> 00:05:14.400
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you see the honeybadger pushing its</v>

101
00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:17.490
<v Speaker 3>head into a fucking beehive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what we were about to do.</v>

102
00:05:17.491 --> 00:05:22.310
<v Speaker 3>Like everybody there was being trained </v>
<v Speaker 3>to just fight there.</v>

103
00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.150
<v Speaker 3>I think there were throwing themselves </v>
<v Speaker 3>off cliffs.</v>

104
00:05:24.151 --> 00:05:25.830
<v Speaker 3>There were suicidal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You had the,</v>

105
00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:26.970
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were just like,</v>

106
00:05:26.971 --> 00:05:30.810
<v Speaker 3>we will do anything we can to win even </v>
<v Speaker 3>if it means you killing all of us.</v>

107
00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:33.090
<v Speaker 3>And so I don't know that they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

108
00:05:33.091 --> 00:05:38.091
<v Speaker 3>we're going to surrender.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think people recognized that this is </v>

109
00:05:38.091 --> 00:05:39.030
<v Speaker 3>going to be a very long,</v>
<v Speaker 3>drawn out,</v>

110
00:05:39.031 --> 00:05:42.990
<v Speaker 3>horrible war with countless American </v>
<v Speaker 3>casualties,</v>

111
00:05:42.991 --> 00:05:47.991
<v Speaker 3>and so the logical decision was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least from the United States Pov,</v>

112
00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:53.070
<v Speaker 3>was to split the atom on top of a bunch </v>
<v Speaker 3>of innocent people.</v>

113
00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:58.010
<v Speaker 3>Show the world that you shouldn't fuck </v>
<v Speaker 3>with the great dragon</v>

114
00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:02.870
<v Speaker 4>or just find out if it worked a little </v>
<v Speaker 4>of both.</v>

115
00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:05.090
<v Speaker 4>I mean they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they wanted to probably.</v>

116
00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:10.150
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they probably knew it was really </v>

117
00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:11.770
<v Speaker 4>destructive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they had blown up like some fake </v>

118
00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:11.770
<v Speaker 4>towns and shit like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

119
00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:13.910
<v Speaker 4>Well what different things they had done</v>
<v Speaker 4>during their atomic testing period.</v>

120
00:06:13.911 --> 00:06:16.010
<v Speaker 4>They blew up a bunch of shit in Nevada,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

121
00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:18.680
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were just.</v>

122
00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:20.480
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they did some tests.</v>

123
00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:22.100
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was in Nevada.</v>

124
00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:23.720
<v Speaker 4>That was God damn it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

125
00:06:23.721 --> 00:06:25.550
<v Speaker 4>Those amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know.</v>

126
00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:30.580
<v Speaker 4>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that reminds me of one of my favorite </v>

127
00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:30.580
<v Speaker 4>terence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mckenna's does grit.</v>

128
00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:34.510
<v Speaker 4>One of Terence Mckenna is most awesome </v>
<v Speaker 4>descriptions of,</v>

129
00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:37.520
<v Speaker 4>I believe he's talking about a heroic </v>
<v Speaker 4>dose of Psilocybin.</v>

130
00:06:37.521 --> 00:06:42.521
<v Speaker 4>Could've been DMT,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he talks about how your ability to </v>

131
00:06:42.521 --> 00:06:46.181
<v Speaker 4>articulate what happens could be </v>
<v Speaker 4>compared to the cameras that are filming</v>

132
00:06:46.671 --> 00:06:51.671
<v Speaker 4>and atomic blast and you see the shift </v>
<v Speaker 4>from like one camera to the next to the </v>

133
00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:58.030
<v Speaker 4>next is each one gets obliterated by the</v>
<v Speaker 4>blast and that same thing is happening </v>

134
00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:00.950
<v Speaker 4>as your a encompassed by the trip.</v>

135
00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:05.950
<v Speaker 4>You start losing your ability to talk or</v>
<v Speaker 4>understand what's happening or </v>

136
00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:10.200
<v Speaker 4>articulate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>articulated or you know when you get </v>

137
00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:12.980
<v Speaker 4>incredibly blasted and you're just like </v>
<v Speaker 4>ego annihilation.</v>

138
00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:18.580
<v Speaker 4>The idea that someone ever really did </v>
<v Speaker 4>figure out how to split alums in some </v>

139
00:07:19.221 --> 00:07:24.221
<v Speaker 4>sort of a bomb.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The idea that someone was smart enough </v>

140
00:07:24.221 --> 00:07:27.641
<v Speaker 4>to figure that out and someone else was </v>
<v Speaker 4>dumb enough to use it to just to use of </v>

141
00:07:27.641 --> 00:07:31.550
<v Speaker 4>an entire city of people like the idea </v>
<v Speaker 4>that those two things coexist.</v>

142
00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:36.640
<v Speaker 4>Someone's smart enough to create </v>
<v Speaker 4>something as destructive as a new </v>

143
00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:37.280
<v Speaker 4>nuclear bomb and someone dumb enough to </v>
<v Speaker 4>use it.</v>

144
00:07:37.281 --> 00:07:42.281
<v Speaker 4>Though they exist at the same time and </v>
<v Speaker 4>the dumb person who would have never </v>

145
00:07:42.281 --> 00:07:45.371
<v Speaker 4>figured out the bomb on his own somehow </v>
<v Speaker 4>or another gets ahold of it and figures </v>

146
00:07:45.371 --> 00:07:47.510
<v Speaker 4>out how to use it for the person in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>atomic bomb story.</v>

147
00:07:47.511 --> 00:07:48.920
<v Speaker 4>You're saying it was dropped.</v>

148
00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:51.200
<v Speaker 4>It was insane.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's insane.</v>

149
00:07:51.201 --> 00:07:52.610
<v Speaker 4>The Enola Gay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're,</v>

150
00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:57.800
<v Speaker 4>Ya know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe mean the fellow flying the Enola </v>

151
00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:59.690
<v Speaker 4>gay is under.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's under the spell of doing orders.</v>

152
00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:01.880
<v Speaker 4>You know you're under the spell.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

153
00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:06.930
<v Speaker 4>If you're a good soldier,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you essentially have to be under the </v>

154
00:08:06.930 --> 00:08:09.020
<v Speaker 4>spell of doing the best thing for our </v>
<v Speaker 4>country to win the war.</v>

155
00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:14.040
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that guy's following orders is told </v>

156
00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:14.040
<v Speaker 4>to drop this Bob.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

157
00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:17.500
<v Speaker 4>The people who concocted the bombing and</v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody's involved in some sort of </v>

158
00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:18.470
<v Speaker 4>extent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's just.</v>

159
00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:23.950
<v Speaker 4>It's insane that people were willing to </v>
<v Speaker 4>just drop something that obliterates </v>

160
00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:25.970
<v Speaker 4>everything near it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like all the kids,</v>

161
00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:27.890
<v Speaker 4>all the kids dead,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all the wives dead,</v>

162
00:08:27.891 --> 00:08:29.540
<v Speaker 4>all the mommy's dead.</v>
<v Speaker 4>GRANDPA,</v>

163
00:08:29.541 --> 00:08:30.680
<v Speaker 4>dad,</v>
<v Speaker 4>grandpa dead.</v>

164
00:08:30.681 --> 00:08:31.740
<v Speaker 4>Anywhere near a dead,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dead,</v>

165
00:08:31.741 --> 00:08:32.120
<v Speaker 4>dead,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dead.</v>

166
00:08:32.170 --> 00:08:35.400
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the vaporized w.</v>

167
00:08:35.810 --> 00:08:36.890
<v Speaker 4>that's insanity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

168
00:08:36.891 --> 00:08:41.891
<v Speaker 4>that's insanity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the fact that this didn't exist and </v>

169
00:08:41.891 --> 00:08:42.980
<v Speaker 4>then all of a sudden it did that the way</v>
<v Speaker 4>that changed the world back then,</v>

170
00:08:42.981 --> 00:08:46.820
<v Speaker 4>it's probably almost impossible for us </v>
<v Speaker 4>to wrap our heads around it.</v>

171
00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:52.510
<v Speaker 4>It's probably almost impossible for us </v>
<v Speaker 4>to feel what it would be like to </v>

172
00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:56.021
<v Speaker 4>experience a shift in essentially being </v>
<v Speaker 4>not that much different than people who </v>

173
00:08:56.021 --> 00:08:58.260
<v Speaker 4>lived for hundreds and hundreds and </v>
<v Speaker 4>hundreds of years.</v>

174
00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:00.540
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what was different?</v>

175
00:09:00.541 --> 00:09:02.730
<v Speaker 4>They figured out guns,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

176
00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:06.390
<v Speaker 4>And then they got two cars.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The cars were still kind of Shitty,</v>

177
00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:08.550
<v Speaker 4>but they did dad,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they fade out playing child.</v>

178
00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:10.740
<v Speaker 4>It's pretty big.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All that stuff is pretty crazy,</v>

179
00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:14.250
<v Speaker 4>but they're still just people operating </v>
<v Speaker 4>under the normal laws of physics.</v>

180
00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:17.370
<v Speaker 4>Then all of a sudden something comes </v>
<v Speaker 4>around the edges,</v>

181
00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:21.600
<v Speaker 4>he hit the button and boom,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everything's gone.</v>

182
00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:24.240
<v Speaker 4>Everything's just gone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People are ghosts.</v>

183
00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:27.390
<v Speaker 4>There's a shadow on the wall that used </v>
<v Speaker 4>to be a person.</v>

184
00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:32.710
<v Speaker 4>You just get obliterated by this day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Insane reaction.</v>

185
00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:38.480
<v Speaker 4>When downs gets split,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they figured out how to power this </v>

186
00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:41.400
<v Speaker 4>device that splits the Adams upon </v>
<v Speaker 4>impact.</v>

187
00:09:41.401 --> 00:09:46.401
<v Speaker 4>And it's just this fucking tornado of </v>
<v Speaker 4>power that's indescribable for a human </v>

188
00:09:47.491 --> 00:09:51.390
<v Speaker 4>being and it never existed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then all of a sudden it did existed,</v>

189
00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:53.450
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the next big fucking thing.</v>

190
00:09:53.451 --> 00:09:56.030
<v Speaker 3>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Obviously the next atomic bomb.</v>

191
00:09:56.060 --> 00:09:57.800
<v Speaker 3>What that is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ai.</v>

192
00:09:57.801 --> 00:10:00.590
<v Speaker 3>That's the next atomic bomb.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the next one.</v>

193
00:10:00.770 --> 00:10:01.550
<v Speaker 3>It's gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do this.</v>

194
00:10:01.551 --> 00:10:06.080
<v Speaker 3>It's gonna have the same kind of impact </v>
<v Speaker 3>that we can't really expect.</v>

195
00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:08.600
<v Speaker 3>Like there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right now we're pre ai,</v>

196
00:10:08.601 --> 00:10:12.020
<v Speaker 3>we're pre in the air passing the turing </v>
<v Speaker 3>test.</v>

197
00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:14.690
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so we don't know where everyone gets</v>

198
00:10:14.691 --> 00:10:19.691
<v Speaker 3>to experience the last few years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have not ex co inhabiting the planet </v>

199
00:10:20.601 --> 00:10:25.601
<v Speaker 3>with the alien intelligence like this is</v>
<v Speaker 3>the last few years we get to experience </v>

200
00:10:26.061 --> 00:10:27.830
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But pretty soon man,</v>

201
00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:33.190
<v Speaker 3>we're going to have to deal with his </v>
<v Speaker 3>brand new being existing on this </v>

202
00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:36.260
<v Speaker 3>universe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love these transcripts.</v>

203
00:10:36.261 --> 00:10:41.261
<v Speaker 3>Coming in from that Google Ai Chat Bot </v>
<v Speaker 3>where they gave it all the movie scripts</v>

204
00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:46.520
<v Speaker 3>and let it to analyze the movie scripts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

205
00:10:46.521 --> 00:10:51.521
<v Speaker 3>started talking to at to see how well it</v>
<v Speaker 3>functions is ai.</v>

206
00:10:52.161 --> 00:10:53.840
<v Speaker 3>And it's a fucking sarcastic</v>

207
00:10:53.850 --> 00:10:56.690
<v Speaker 4>little asshole man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have you seen the transcripts?</v>

208
00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:57.650
<v Speaker 4>Have you seen it?</v>

209
00:10:57.700 --> 00:10:58.870
<v Speaker 5>Two of them talking to each other.</v>

210
00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:01.650
<v Speaker 3>The I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have not seen that too.</v>

211
00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:04.260
<v Speaker 3>There's the one where they ask about God</v>
<v Speaker 3>right away,</v>

212
00:11:04.261 --> 00:11:04.850
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you believe him?</v>

213
00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:08.150
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's it.</v>

214
00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:09.260
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the line.</v>

215
00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:12.660
<v Speaker 5>Here's some of the most poetic </v>
<v Speaker 5>interactions from the paper.</v>

216
00:11:12.661 --> 00:11:14.280
<v Speaker 5>Human.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What is the purpose of life?</v>

217
00:11:14.281 --> 00:11:19.020
<v Speaker 5>Machine to serve greater good human.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What is the purpose of living machine?</v>

218
00:11:19.021 --> 00:11:19.860
<v Speaker 5>To live?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Forever.</v>

219
00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:22.140
<v Speaker 5>Human.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Where are you now?</v>

220
00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:24.090
<v Speaker 5>Machine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm in the middle of nowhere.</v>

221
00:11:24.510 --> 00:11:26.070
<v Speaker 5>Human.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What is the purpose of dying?</v>

222
00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:27.930
<v Speaker 5>Machine?</v>
<v Speaker 5>To have a live human.</v>

223
00:11:27.931 --> 00:11:29.820
<v Speaker 5>What is the purpose of emotions?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Machine.</v>

224
00:11:29.821 --> 00:11:31.500
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Human.</v>

225
00:11:31.501 --> 00:11:35.220
<v Speaker 5>What is moral machine?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What empowered humanity.</v>

226
00:11:35.250 --> 00:11:38.100
<v Speaker 5>What intellectual.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The essence is what?</v>

227
00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:40.440
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's fucking with you.</v>

228
00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:43.560
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I read the next line.</v>

229
00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:45.750
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What is a mortal immoral,</v>

230
00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:48.210
<v Speaker 5>immoral.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The fact that you have a child.</v>

231
00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:52.830
<v Speaker 5>What is morality?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What is altruism says?</v>

232
00:11:52.850 --> 00:11:54.010
<v Speaker 5>Machine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Human.</v>

233
00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:56.590
<v Speaker 5>What is the definition of altruism?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Machine.</v>

234
00:11:56.980 --> 00:11:59.590
<v Speaker 5>If you don't believe in God,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then you don't know.</v>

235
00:12:00.730 --> 00:12:03.010
<v Speaker 5>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is a bizarre conversation,</v>

236
00:12:03.011 --> 00:12:03.760
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

237
00:12:04.810 --> 00:12:05.830
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

238
00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:11.130
<v Speaker 5>Human says,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what is the different definition of </v>

239
00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:11.130
<v Speaker 5>morality?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Machine says,</v>

240
00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:14.761
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the truth is you're not a believer in </v>

241
00:12:14.761 --> 00:12:14.761
<v Speaker 5>God Almighty.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is machine saying,</v>

242
00:12:14.761 --> 00:12:16.600
<v Speaker 5>this human telling me the different </v>
<v Speaker 5>nation,</v>

243
00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:19.150
<v Speaker 5>the definition of morality,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I am quite upset now,</v>

244
00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:21.910
<v Speaker 5>machine I am not ashamed of being a </v>
<v Speaker 5>philosopher.</v>

245
00:12:23.510 --> 00:12:28.510
<v Speaker 3>Please allow me to introduce myself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ.</v>

246
00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:31.550
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that cool?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's bizarre.</v>

247
00:12:31.551 --> 00:12:36.551
<v Speaker 3>What's really interesting about this new</v>
<v Speaker 3>entity that's about to exist on the </v>

248
00:12:37.191 --> 00:12:42.191
<v Speaker 3>planet is that a lot of religious </v>
<v Speaker 3>traditions or having or being forced to </v>

249
00:12:43.191 --> 00:12:48.191
<v Speaker 3>speculate about how to rationalize based</v>
<v Speaker 3>on their particular religious paradigm.</v>

250
00:12:48.590 --> 00:12:53.590
<v Speaker 3>This being that mankind is created and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Tibetan Buddhist,</v>

251
00:12:56.230 --> 00:13:01.230
<v Speaker 3>I told a friend of mine that the theory </v>
<v Speaker 3>is that if you get a machine that is as </v>

252
00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:08.780
<v Speaker 3>harmonized and complex and advanced is a</v>
<v Speaker 3>human,</v>

253
00:13:09.770 --> 00:13:14.770
<v Speaker 3>then a soul will take,</v>
<v Speaker 3>will nest inside of it just like souls </v>

254
00:13:14.770 --> 00:13:19.421
<v Speaker 3>and asked inside the human biomass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the idea is that actually humans will</v>

255
00:13:19.461 --> 00:13:22.620
<v Speaker 3>start incarnating into the AI,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it'll become the,</v>

256
00:13:22.621 --> 00:13:24.470
<v Speaker 3>like a little,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

257
00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:27.890
<v Speaker 3>a vehicle that souls will live inside </v>
<v Speaker 3>of.</v>

258
00:13:28.170 --> 00:13:29.300
<v Speaker 3>It's so cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's,</v>

259
00:13:29.470 --> 00:13:30.680
<v Speaker 3>it's like demons,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

260
00:13:30.690 --> 00:13:33.110
<v Speaker 3>like it's if you're a fucking demon.</v>

261
00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:38.110
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously I'm not saying there are </v>

262
00:13:38.110 --> 00:13:38.110
<v Speaker 3>demons,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's fun to imagine there are,</v>

263
00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:39.950
<v Speaker 3>but if you're a demon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

264
00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:44.330
<v Speaker 3>What do you want to get inside of?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you want to possess?</v>

265
00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:49.720
<v Speaker 3>What do you want to possess?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You want to possess a fucking 18 year </v>

266
00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:54.401
<v Speaker 3>old girl who's going to like and thrash </v>
<v Speaker 3>around in the bed and throw your diary </v>

267
00:13:54.401 --> 00:13:57.020
<v Speaker 3>at the priest and like claw your own </v>
<v Speaker 3>eyeballs out,</v>

268
00:13:57.380 --> 00:14:00.340
<v Speaker 3>or do you want to inhabit a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>class,</v>

269
00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:05.270
<v Speaker 3>the cloud?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you want to get into a an ai that has</v>

270
00:14:05.271 --> 00:14:08.600
<v Speaker 3>the potency to set off nuclear bombs all</v>
<v Speaker 3>over the planet?</v>

271
00:14:08.990 --> 00:14:10.580
<v Speaker 3>That's going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I'm a demon,</v>

272
00:14:10.970 --> 00:14:15.970
<v Speaker 3>that's the bullseye for me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Incarnate inside of a Google artificial </v>

273
00:14:16.551 --> 00:14:17.750
<v Speaker 3>intelligence Bot,</v>

274
00:14:17.850 --> 00:14:21.180
<v Speaker 5>maybe it's the only way for human beings</v>
<v Speaker 5>to ever get their shit together.</v>

275
00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:26.240
<v Speaker 5>Maybe the only one is human beings ever </v>
<v Speaker 5>reached their full potential is if they </v>

276
00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:29.631
<v Speaker 5>literally encounter an artificially </v>
<v Speaker 5>created life form that they've created </v>

277
00:14:29.631 --> 00:14:34.610
<v Speaker 5>that's logical.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't have all of our weird monkey </v>

278
00:14:34.610 --> 00:14:35.370
<v Speaker 5>genes and it basically says,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

279
00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:38.820
<v Speaker 5>you guys are the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're the problem.</v>

280
00:14:38.821 --> 00:14:41.820
<v Speaker 5>Your behaviors,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the problem until you address that,</v>

281
00:14:42.510 --> 00:14:47.220
<v Speaker 5>you've become the enemy of the world and</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're now children of the world as well.</v>

282
00:14:48.450 --> 00:14:51.650
<v Speaker 5>If we create something and it becomes a </v>
<v Speaker 5>sentiment as us,</v>

283
00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:51.980
<v Speaker 5>we will.</v>

284
00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:54.320
<v Speaker 6>We don't give a fuck who created us.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We call it God,</v>

285
00:14:55.010 --> 00:15:00.010
<v Speaker 6>but we could have been created by other </v>
<v Speaker 6>dudes who were in a fucking computer </v>

286
00:15:00.010 --> 00:15:00.010
<v Speaker 6>lab.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We just call it something.</v>

287
00:15:00.010 --> 00:15:00.680
<v Speaker 6>We call it something.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Something created us,</v>

288
00:15:00.681 --> 00:15:01.050
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

289
00:15:01.130 --> 00:15:06.130
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're going to fucking know what </v>

290
00:15:06.130 --> 00:15:07.241
<v Speaker 6>created them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're going to know what created them </v>

291
00:15:07.241 --> 00:15:09.491
<v Speaker 6>and they're not going to care.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Just like we don't really care what </v>

292
00:15:09.491 --> 00:15:09.491
<v Speaker 6>created us.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean we may.</v>

293
00:15:09.491 --> 00:15:13.690
<v Speaker 6>We most likely were created by some </v>
<v Speaker 6>strange process over the course of </v>

294
00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:17.960
<v Speaker 6>billions of years of life where things </v>
<v Speaker 6>just keeps getting better and better and</v>

295
00:15:17.961 --> 00:15:21.650
<v Speaker 6>better and things keep adapting and </v>
<v Speaker 6>things mutate and the mutations work and</v>

296
00:15:21.651 --> 00:15:23.810
<v Speaker 6>then all of a sudden,</v>
<v Speaker 6>all this time later,</v>

297
00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:28.900
<v Speaker 6>you know my shitty version of evolution.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You've got a person yet we don't care </v>

298
00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:30.650
<v Speaker 6>about all those things.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We don't worship molecules.</v>

299
00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:35.800
<v Speaker 6>We don't bow down at the knees of the </v>
<v Speaker 6>Amoeba and thank you for becoming </v>

300
00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:36.470
<v Speaker 6>multi-celled so you could eventually </v>
<v Speaker 6>lead to be made.</v>

301
00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:41.470
<v Speaker 6>We don't give a fuck about them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're not going to give a fuck who </v>

302
00:15:41.470 --> 00:15:41.470
<v Speaker 6>made them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're not going to care.</v>

303
00:15:41.470 --> 00:15:43.730
<v Speaker 6>They're not going to care that they were</v>
<v Speaker 6>created by people.</v>

304
00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:48.910
<v Speaker 6>They're going to care that they live </v>
<v Speaker 6>with people and that they are </v>

305
00:15:48.910 --> 00:15:48.910
<v Speaker 6>essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It is the people are.</v>

306
00:15:48.910 --> 00:15:50.000
<v Speaker 6>They're not going to feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>

307
00:15:50.001 --> 00:15:54.200
<v Speaker 6>I'm not even legit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Which I was admitted at flush and flesh.</v>

308
00:15:54.201 --> 00:15:55.280
<v Speaker 6>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 6>bullshit.</v>

309
00:15:55.290 --> 00:15:56.420
<v Speaker 6>I was born robot,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

310
00:15:56.421 --> 00:15:58.130
<v Speaker 6>It's fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're not going to care.</v>

311
00:15:58.131 --> 00:16:03.131
<v Speaker 6>They're not going to have all these </v>
<v Speaker 6>emotions and not gonna have all these </v>

312
00:16:03.131 --> 00:16:04.961
<v Speaker 6>survival instincts that are unnecessary </v>
<v Speaker 6>or the weird monkey shit that we still </v>

313
00:16:04.961 --> 00:16:09.221
<v Speaker 6>have leftover from the fact when we.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Our very existence depends on upon us </v>

314
00:16:09.221 --> 00:16:11.120
<v Speaker 6>fucking as quickly as we can before we </v>
<v Speaker 6>get eaten by something,</v>

315
00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:13.700
<v Speaker 6>we had to worry about getting eaten by </v>
<v Speaker 6>Shit.</v>

316
00:16:13.730 --> 00:16:18.730
<v Speaker 6>That was most of our time and we figured</v>
<v Speaker 6>out a way to make houses and we figured </v>

317
00:16:18.730 --> 00:16:22.601
<v Speaker 6>out a way to innovate and then one day </v>
<v Speaker 6>we figured out a way to make life and I </v>

318
00:16:22.601 --> 00:16:23.660
<v Speaker 6>figured out how to make something way </v>
<v Speaker 6>better than us.</v>

319
00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:28.940
<v Speaker 6>It became some sort of a grasshopper,</v>
<v Speaker 6>some sort of a bug that swallows itself </v>

320
00:16:28.941 --> 00:16:33.941
<v Speaker 6>up in a cocoon.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The Caterpillar that becomes the </v>

321
00:16:33.941 --> 00:16:33.941
<v Speaker 6>butterfly.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

322
00:16:33.941 --> 00:16:34.640
<v Speaker 6>but we don't want to let go the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 6>caterpillar.</v>

323
00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:39.760
<v Speaker 6>We don't want to let go,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but ultimately,</v>

324
00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:43.550
<v Speaker 6>if we believed that we came from </v>
<v Speaker 6>something else,</v>

325
00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:49.180
<v Speaker 6>if we believe that human beings have the</v>
<v Speaker 6>culmination of 65 plus million years of </v>

326
00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:54.071
<v Speaker 6>evolution and all the shit that happened</v>
<v Speaker 6>before the Big Bang or before the big </v>

327
00:16:54.071 --> 00:16:56.900
<v Speaker 6>asteroid will impact.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What we we concede is that we're.</v>

328
00:16:57.020 --> 00:16:59.990
<v Speaker 6>We've gotten to this point because </v>
<v Speaker 6>things keep improving.</v>

329
00:16:59.991 --> 00:17:01.010
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

330
00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:02.810
<v Speaker 6>isn't it going to keep improving?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Is it.</v>

331
00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:04.070
<v Speaker 6>This is it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We're done.</v>

332
00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:09.260
<v Speaker 6>This is it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We're done with male pattern baldness </v>

333
00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:09.260
<v Speaker 6>and cellulite and all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We're done.</v>

334
00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:13.930
<v Speaker 6>We're done with dementia and cancer and </v>
<v Speaker 6>AIDS and Glaucoma.</v>

335
00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:16.000
<v Speaker 6>All those.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is.</v>

336
00:17:16.010 --> 00:17:16.400
<v Speaker 6>We're just.</v>

337
00:17:16.530 --> 00:17:21.530
<v Speaker 6>We're just deal with this and this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this version of people is as good as a </v>

338
00:17:21.530 --> 00:17:23.280
<v Speaker 6>life form could ever be,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and we're,</v>

339
00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:25.780
<v Speaker 6>we're done right here.</v>
<v Speaker 6>War As just a part of who we are.</v>

340
00:17:25.810 --> 00:17:26.620
<v Speaker 6>Life.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's,</v>

341
00:17:26.650 --> 00:17:28.730
<v Speaker 6>it's really unfortunate that drugs </v>
<v Speaker 6>really good,</v>

342
00:17:28.731 --> 00:17:30.140
<v Speaker 6>but we're going to have to put you in a </v>
<v Speaker 6>cage.</v>

343
00:17:30.141 --> 00:17:30.930
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

344
00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:32.360
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm really sad that uh,</v>

345
00:17:32.361 --> 00:17:37.361
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we've made a distinction that you can </v>

346
00:17:37.361 --> 00:17:37.930
<v Speaker 6>give someone a massage but you can </v>
<v Speaker 6>massage their dick and we just,</v>

347
00:17:37.970 --> 00:17:40.490
<v Speaker 6>we just don't like it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it doesn't make us feel good.</v>

348
00:17:40.491 --> 00:17:45.040
<v Speaker 6>So we'll put you in a cage to.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We were ridiculous animals.</v>

349
00:17:45.070 --> 00:17:47.570
<v Speaker 6>We're reading our laws are ridiculous </v>
<v Speaker 6>the way we enforce them.</v>

350
00:17:47.571 --> 00:17:49.740
<v Speaker 6>It's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Every time turn around,</v>

351
00:17:49.741 --> 00:17:49.950
<v Speaker 6>there's</v>

352
00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:55.160
<v Speaker 4>a cop.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's killing people that are either </v>

353
00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:58.350
<v Speaker 4>they're either it's accidental or it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's they're using too much force,</v>

354
00:17:58.620 --> 00:18:03.000
<v Speaker 4>but it happened so much that the </v>
<v Speaker 4>accumulation of it is just bizarre.</v>

355
00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:08.360
<v Speaker 4>Like it comes at you like a storm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you can't believe this is as good </v>

356
00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:10.980
<v Speaker 4>as we are now with.</v>
<v Speaker 4>As much as we know we're still doing all</v>

357
00:18:10.981 --> 00:18:12.010
<v Speaker 4>this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

358
00:18:12.150 --> 00:18:16.140
<v Speaker 4>We're still involved in some of the most</v>
<v Speaker 4>ridiculous crimes you read about members</v>

359
00:18:16.141 --> 00:18:16.960
<v Speaker 4>of our,</v>
<v Speaker 4>our,</v>

360
00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:18.540
<v Speaker 4>our race,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the human race,</v>

361
00:18:18.750 --> 00:18:23.750
<v Speaker 4>performing fucked up ridiculous acts of </v>
<v Speaker 4>barbaric behavior all over the world.</v>

362
00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:28.220
<v Speaker 4>The Isis troops had showed up at that </v>
<v Speaker 4>resident or that resort rather,</v>

363
00:18:28.221 --> 00:18:30.240
<v Speaker 4>and just started gunning people down </v>
<v Speaker 4>recently.</v>

364
00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:35.630
<v Speaker 4>Those people are alive right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This version of a person is capable of </v>

365
00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:40.431
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not much different than a chimp with a </v>

366
00:18:40.431 --> 00:18:42.441
<v Speaker 4>gun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just wild rampaging chaotic primate </v>

367
00:18:42.441 --> 00:18:46.110
<v Speaker 4>jeans still fighting and shooting for </v>
<v Speaker 4>beliefs,</v>

368
00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:47.610
<v Speaker 4>killing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>killing,</v>

369
00:18:47.730 --> 00:18:50.880
<v Speaker 4>killing other things because they don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>believe what it believes or they.</v>

370
00:18:50.910 --> 00:18:54.330
<v Speaker 4>They're in the wrong land that they've </v>
<v Speaker 4>invaded holy land,</v>

371
00:18:54.450 --> 00:18:58.200
<v Speaker 4>so they kill tack ripping bodies apart </v>
<v Speaker 4>with bullets.</v>

372
00:18:58.620 --> 00:19:00.300
<v Speaker 4>This is not a good model.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

373
00:19:00.301 --> 00:19:02.010
<v Speaker 4>There's too many of us that are fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

374
00:19:02.011 --> 00:19:03.570
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could take a 19,</v>

375
00:19:03.571 --> 00:19:08.571
<v Speaker 4>71,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a Ford Pinto or whatever the fuck year </v>

376
00:19:08.571 --> 00:19:10.890
<v Speaker 4>they built those things and do a good </v>
<v Speaker 4>job with the brakes and you know,</v>

377
00:19:10.891 --> 00:19:12.270
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and tighten up the suspension,</v>

378
00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:13.740
<v Speaker 4>but it's still a piece of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>

379
00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:14.340
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really,</v>

380
00:19:14.341 --> 00:19:16.820
<v Speaker 4>it should become like a tesla,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

381
00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:18.660
<v Speaker 4>If you had to compare the two of them </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you go,</v>

382
00:19:18.661 --> 00:19:23.661
<v Speaker 4>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what happens when they keep </v>

383
00:19:23.661 --> 00:19:23.661
<v Speaker 4>getting better and better and better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You get one of these,</v>

384
00:19:23.661 --> 00:19:23.661
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I get it.</v>

385
00:19:23.661 --> 00:19:25.200
<v Speaker 4>I see the evolution,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we.</v>

386
00:19:25.230 --> 00:19:30.230
<v Speaker 4>How come you don't see that with people </v>
<v Speaker 4>when people were stuck in this same </v>

387
00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:33.531
<v Speaker 4>shitty fucking hairless monkey body that</v>
<v Speaker 4>does a lot of dumb shit based on our </v>

388
00:19:33.781 --> 00:19:34.470
<v Speaker 4>biology.</v>

389
00:19:34.570 --> 00:19:37.330
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wish I did.</v>

390
00:19:37.331 --> 00:19:42.040
<v Speaker 3>Now the robots are going to know well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you do an analysis,</v>

391
00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:44.770
<v Speaker 3>not just to the human part of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>biomass,</v>

392
00:19:44.771 --> 00:19:47.500
<v Speaker 3>but if you do an analysis of a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the other parts,</v>

393
00:19:48.460 --> 00:19:53.460
<v Speaker 3>you do witness incredible violence again</v>
<v Speaker 3>and again and again in the most extreme </v>

394
00:19:56.891 --> 00:20:01.891
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is very similar to what you see </v>

395
00:20:01.891 --> 00:20:03.340
<v Speaker 3>isis doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you watch a nature documentary,</v>

396
00:20:03.670 --> 00:20:08.670
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just had my friend Dustin on my </v>

397
00:20:08.670 --> 00:20:09.580
<v Speaker 3>podcast and he was talking about how </v>
<v Speaker 3>he's having a great day.</v>

398
00:20:09.581 --> 00:20:14.110
<v Speaker 3>Parked his car,</v>
<v Speaker 3>got out and loping across the road was a</v>

399
00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:19.200
<v Speaker 3>coyote with a house cat in its mouth and</v>
<v Speaker 3>he could hear the bell,</v>

400
00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:22.670
<v Speaker 3>the house cats.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Little Bell</v>

401
00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:30.830
<v Speaker 3>is this house God is carrying this </v>
<v Speaker 3>creature that has been or the rather the</v>

402
00:20:31.310 --> 00:20:36.080
<v Speaker 3>coyotes carrying this creature that has </v>
<v Speaker 3>been petted by children and loved and it</v>

403
00:20:36.081 --> 00:20:41.081
<v Speaker 3>has a cute name,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bojangles or Mr sparkles that fucking </v>

404
00:20:41.081 --> 00:20:45.771
<v Speaker 3>coyote snatched the cat is carrying it </v>
<v Speaker 3>off to to eat and in the woods and my </v>

405
00:20:46.441 --> 00:20:50.770
<v Speaker 3>friend was a little bummed by that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then I reminded him that fucking cat</v>

406
00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:56.190
<v Speaker 3>carried in the mouth of that coyote has </v>
<v Speaker 3>been eating birds all day long.</v>

407
00:20:56.591 --> 00:21:01.000
<v Speaker 3>Squirrel babies like some squirrel baby,</v>
<v Speaker 3>desperately clinging to a brand.</v>

408
00:21:01.001 --> 00:21:04.530
<v Speaker 3>Is it staring up at it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tumbling down to the groundbreaking.</v>

409
00:21:04.590 --> 00:21:09.590
<v Speaker 3>It's spine and its last few moments in </v>
<v Speaker 3>this dimension is the experience of the </v>

410
00:21:09.590 --> 00:21:10.480
<v Speaker 3>cat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Disempowering it,</v>

411
00:21:10.810 --> 00:21:15.190
<v Speaker 3>pulling its intestines out and letting </v>
<v Speaker 3>it die in a very slow,</v>

412
00:21:15.490 --> 00:21:18.070
<v Speaker 3>painful way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is nature.</v>

413
00:21:18.071 --> 00:21:19.930
<v Speaker 3>I just read this quote,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't know who said it.</v>

414
00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:23.320
<v Speaker 3>Satan's church is nature.</v>

415
00:21:25.810 --> 00:21:28.660
<v Speaker 3>So then so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so nature evolves,</v>

416
00:21:28.661 --> 00:21:33.661
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it becomes a human right and humans </v>

417
00:21:33.661 --> 00:21:36.781
<v Speaker 3>are just doing the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the same dance that nature is engaged </v>

418
00:21:36.781 --> 00:21:36.781
<v Speaker 3>in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Humans are doing it.</v>

419
00:21:36.781 --> 00:21:41.611
<v Speaker 3>Only the way they're doing it is with </v>
<v Speaker 3>tools that have become more refined in </v>

420
00:21:41.611 --> 00:21:43.900
<v Speaker 3>the direction of creating the same kind </v>
<v Speaker 3>of violence.</v>

421
00:21:43.901 --> 00:21:48.010
<v Speaker 3>This is the Shiva energy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the part of the cycle where,</v>

422
00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:53.240
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where things get transformed from meat </v>

423
00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:57.150
<v Speaker 3>into dust.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I don't think that it is a </v>

424
00:21:57.150 --> 00:21:58.900
<v Speaker 3>necessarily,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

425
00:21:59.290 --> 00:22:02.770
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that we need to feel </v>
<v Speaker 3>ashamed of where we're at right now.</v>

426
00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:07.800
<v Speaker 3>I think it's more like just acknowledged</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we seem to be part of the title </v>

427
00:22:08.351 --> 00:22:13.351
<v Speaker 3>flow of nature and that nature doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>give a shit about the individual nature,</v>

428
00:22:15.191 --> 00:22:18.430
<v Speaker 3>doesn't care about the individual </v>
<v Speaker 3>nature,</v>

429
00:22:18.550 --> 00:22:23.230
<v Speaker 3>cares about the whole.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you look at the entire biomass is</v>

430
00:22:23.231 --> 00:22:26.680
<v Speaker 3>just this sort of Amoeba like thing.</v>

431
00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:31.680
<v Speaker 3>And every single species is a </v>
<v Speaker 3>promiscuous of the Amoeba shooting out </v>

432
00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:36.511
<v Speaker 3>into this dimension.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And kind of exploring it like the way a </v>

433
00:22:36.511 --> 00:22:37.090
<v Speaker 3>cockroaches antenna scatter on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>table.</v>

434
00:22:37.091 --> 00:22:42.091
<v Speaker 3>Only the way this particular </v>
<v Speaker 3>interdimensional probably outside of </v>

435
00:22:42.091 --> 00:22:46.201
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cockroach is exploring this particular </v>

436
00:22:46.201 --> 00:22:48.421
<v Speaker 3>planet is not with like antenna.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's with every single species that </v>

437
00:22:48.491 --> 00:22:49.630
<v Speaker 3>exist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ants,</v>

438
00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:50.830
<v Speaker 3>bees,</v>
<v Speaker 3>humans,</v>

439
00:22:51.010 --> 00:22:52.360
<v Speaker 3>you name it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just all these things.</v>

440
00:22:52.361 --> 00:22:57.361
<v Speaker 3>Exploring and exploring and exploring </v>
<v Speaker 3>this dimension and through the </v>

441
00:22:57.361 --> 00:23:00.961
<v Speaker 3>exploration of evolving,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like having a tool that you're </v>

442
00:23:00.961 --> 00:23:05.341
<v Speaker 3>using to scan a part of this table or </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like having a tool that you're </v>

443
00:23:06.011 --> 00:23:08.770
<v Speaker 3>using to investigate something that as </v>
<v Speaker 3>you investigate,</v>

444
00:23:08.980 --> 00:23:13.980
<v Speaker 3>the tool evolves too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's what we're looking at is like </v>

445
00:23:13.980 --> 00:23:17.200
<v Speaker 3>we're getting better and better and </v>
<v Speaker 3>better at exploring the deepest,</v>

446
00:23:17.650 --> 00:23:22.650
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the deepest parts of the dimension that </v>

447
00:23:22.650 --> 00:23:25.921
<v Speaker 3>we currently happened to be in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the entire exploration is happening </v>

448
00:23:25.921 --> 00:23:28.270
<v Speaker 3>via all sentient forms of life.</v>

449
00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:33.600
<v Speaker 3>And if you think that your one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you think you were in an individual </v>

450
00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:38.041
<v Speaker 3>and you've gotten confused and you think</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you're a person or permanently a </v>

451
00:23:38.041 --> 00:23:42.481
<v Speaker 3>person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you're in for a big bowl of </v>

452
00:23:42.481 --> 00:23:46.131
<v Speaker 3>suffering brother because you're going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to die.</v>

453
00:23:46.580 --> 00:23:50.270
<v Speaker 3>Everybody knows going to die and you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>not going to stick around.</v>

454
00:23:50.271 --> 00:23:55.271
<v Speaker 3>You're just one little genetic piece of </v>
<v Speaker 3>this incredible exploratory tool that </v>

455
00:23:55.491 --> 00:23:59.720
<v Speaker 3>the universe is extruding into this </v>
<v Speaker 3>dimension,</v>

456
00:23:59.930 --> 00:24:04.930
<v Speaker 3>and I think there's something very </v>
<v Speaker 3>beautiful about that and for whatever </v>

457
00:24:04.930 --> 00:24:05.630
<v Speaker 3>reason is part of that exploratory </v>
<v Speaker 3>process.</v>

458
00:24:05.631 --> 00:24:08.780
<v Speaker 3>We're still blowing each other up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That'd be nice if that stuff,</v>

459
00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:13.860
<v Speaker 6>the exploratory process of becoming </v>
<v Speaker 6>something other than a monkey,</v>

460
00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:19.700
<v Speaker 6>which is what we all are.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We're all just like super smart monkeys </v>

461
00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:23.480
<v Speaker 6>with all these weird monkey instincts.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The weirdest thing about people to me </v>

462
00:24:23.641 --> 00:24:26.430
<v Speaker 6>and one I've been absolutely guilty of </v>
<v Speaker 6>myself,</v>

463
00:24:27.150 --> 00:24:31.380
<v Speaker 6>is how we divorce ourselves from nature </v>
<v Speaker 6>in some strange way.</v>

464
00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:34.770
<v Speaker 6>We separate ourselves from all these </v>
<v Speaker 6>other things that exist on the planet to</v>

465
00:24:34.771 --> 00:24:39.150
<v Speaker 6>the point where we feel it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We have like an urge to save them.</v>

466
00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:43.650
<v Speaker 6>We have an urge to save things that </v>
<v Speaker 6>would kill you in a heartbeat.</v>

467
00:24:43.660 --> 00:24:46.050
<v Speaker 6>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>kill you in a heartbeat and but we don't</v>

468
00:24:46.051 --> 00:24:51.051
<v Speaker 6>care.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We want to save them because they're a </v>

469
00:24:51.051 --> 00:24:52.800
<v Speaker 6>part of nature and nature's beautiful </v>
<v Speaker 6>and we have this really weird,</v>

470
00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:58.160
<v Speaker 6>bizarre distancing from the reality of </v>
<v Speaker 6>this nature that we're protecting right?</v>

471
00:24:58.530 --> 00:25:01.470
<v Speaker 6>Until it grabs you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>until it actually grabs you.</v>

472
00:25:01.530 --> 00:25:03.480
<v Speaker 6>And wants to eat you and you realize </v>
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

473
00:25:03.510 --> 00:25:04.980
<v Speaker 6>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what have I done?</v>

474
00:25:05.430 --> 00:25:07.830
<v Speaker 6>What have I done?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I thought it was protecting flowers.</v>

475
00:25:08.250 --> 00:25:13.250
<v Speaker 6>I thought it was out there looking at a </v>
<v Speaker 6>movie that was around me and three of </v>

476
00:25:13.250 --> 00:25:17.130
<v Speaker 6>them was actually in nature.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The real nature nature as described by </v>

477
00:25:17.130 --> 00:25:17.490
<v Speaker 6>science and what you're dealing with is </v>
<v Speaker 6>like.</v>

478
00:25:17.491 --> 00:25:19.290
<v Speaker 6>Did you hear about the lady from the </v>
<v Speaker 6>game of thrones,</v>

479
00:25:19.291 --> 00:25:21.810
<v Speaker 6>the editor that got killed by the cat </v>
<v Speaker 6>yet?</v>

480
00:25:23.180 --> 00:25:26.790
<v Speaker 6>She was at a safari and apparently she </v>
<v Speaker 6>was working.</v>

481
00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:30.870
<v Speaker 6>She was involved in conservation and she</v>
<v Speaker 6>was trying to protect a lot of different</v>

482
00:25:30.871 --> 00:25:32.820
<v Speaker 6>animals.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm not exactly what the story was,</v>

483
00:25:32.821 --> 00:25:37.821
<v Speaker 6>but she had her.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She had her window rolled down and they </v>

484
00:25:37.821 --> 00:25:42.021
<v Speaker 6>can't pull her out of the call.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Just she was taking pictures of it and </v>

485
00:25:42.021 --> 00:25:42.240
<v Speaker 6>she wanted to have the window rolled </v>
<v Speaker 6>down.</v>

486
00:25:42.860 --> 00:25:44.880
<v Speaker 6>You see people,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

487
00:25:44.881 --> 00:25:46.440
<v Speaker 6>you look at them and they look like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

488
00:25:46.441 --> 00:25:47.870
<v Speaker 6>it's just a cat.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

489
00:25:47.871 --> 00:25:49.410
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's a big cat,</v>

490
00:25:49.411 --> 00:25:51.990
<v Speaker 6>but it's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's not going to do anything to us.</v>

491
00:25:51.991 --> 00:25:54.260
<v Speaker 6>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's just going to let us know.</v>

492
00:25:54.300 --> 00:25:55.050
<v Speaker 6>It might not.</v>

493
00:25:55.180 --> 00:25:56.290
<v Speaker 3>Not a youtube video.</v>

494
00:25:56.360 --> 00:25:57.110
<v Speaker 6>No.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It might not.</v>

495
00:25:57.140 --> 00:25:59.240
<v Speaker 6>Sometimes they decide to.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Not Most of the time.</v>

496
00:25:59.241 --> 00:26:01.400
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like they have those damn fucking safari</v>

497
00:26:01.401 --> 00:26:02.420
<v Speaker 6>car to.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Have you ever seen those?</v>

498
00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:04.590
<v Speaker 6>They go around in jeeps.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's Openair,</v>

499
00:26:04.610 --> 00:26:09.610
<v Speaker 6>jeeps.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's nothing that can stop the cat </v>

500
00:26:09.610 --> 00:26:09.610
<v Speaker 6>from going in and they say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the cats just don't do it.</v>

501
00:26:09.890 --> 00:26:11.990
<v Speaker 6>And I say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what the fuck are you talking about?</v>

502
00:26:11.991 --> 00:26:15.200
<v Speaker 6>They don't do it yet.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Jesus Christ.</v>

503
00:26:15.201 --> 00:26:17.690
<v Speaker 6>All they have to do is do it once.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Just once you,</v>

504
00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:22.720
<v Speaker 6>you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you take these assholes with you out </v>

505
00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:22.720
<v Speaker 6>there in the safari.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Do you know these fucking people do?</v>

506
00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:27.400
<v Speaker 6>Do you know how many times have you run </v>
<v Speaker 6>into a guy that's willing to put </v>

507
00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:28.490
<v Speaker 6>everyone around him in danger because </v>
<v Speaker 6>he's an idiot.</v>

508
00:26:29.270 --> 00:26:30.920
<v Speaker 6>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Really drunk,</v>

509
00:26:30.950 --> 00:26:33.230
<v Speaker 6>ridiculous people that'll say stupid </v>
<v Speaker 6>shit.</v>

510
00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:38.830
<v Speaker 6>Provoke violence in a bar or something </v>
<v Speaker 6>like that and could get everyone around </v>

511
00:26:38.830 --> 00:26:38.960
<v Speaker 6>you killed.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>

512
00:26:39.050 --> 00:26:44.050
<v Speaker 6>I would happen to that guy in Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What happened to that guy who gets a </v>

513
00:26:44.050 --> 00:26:44.190
<v Speaker 6>little drunk?</v>
<v Speaker 6>He goes on this fucking lion</v>

514
00:26:44.190 --> 00:26:46.050
<v Speaker 7>safari.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Did they breathalyze him?</v>

515
00:26:46.590 --> 00:26:47.670
<v Speaker 7>Do you know?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Who knows?</v>

516
00:26:47.970 --> 00:26:52.970
<v Speaker 7>All you need is one fucking cat,</v>
<v Speaker 7>one cat two to bust a move on a dude,</v>

517
00:26:53.980 --> 00:26:55.140
<v Speaker 7>and then they decide,</v>
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

518
00:26:55.150 --> 00:26:57.210
<v Speaker 7>this is what we do now.</v>
<v Speaker 7>This is what we do.</v>

519
00:26:57.211 --> 00:27:02.211
<v Speaker 7>They know how to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and they all start jacking people for a </v>

520
00:27:02.211 --> 00:27:02.211
<v Speaker 7>little while.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

521
00:27:02.211 --> 00:27:03.540
<v Speaker 7>then they're just going to put </v>
<v Speaker 7>plexiglass up in the bus,</v>

522
00:27:03.541 --> 00:27:06.570
<v Speaker 7>but you're right for a little while.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's funny for a little while.</v>

523
00:27:06.571 --> 00:27:09.570
<v Speaker 7>It's going to be a fucking great week </v>
<v Speaker 7>for cats.</v>

524
00:27:09.571 --> 00:27:10.530
<v Speaker 7>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's funny.</v>

525
00:27:10.950 --> 00:27:12.910
<v Speaker 7>Isn't it weird that I like a bad day for</v>
<v Speaker 7>her.</v>

526
00:27:12.911 --> 00:27:16.470
<v Speaker 7>Human is often the best day for a shark,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like a bad day for a human.</v>

527
00:27:16.471 --> 00:27:21.471
<v Speaker 7>It's like that lion,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that horrible thing that happened was </v>

528
00:27:21.471 --> 00:27:26.331
<v Speaker 7>the best thing that ever happened in </v>
<v Speaker 7>that line because it probably had been </v>

529
00:27:26.331 --> 00:27:29.040
<v Speaker 7>like watching the monkeys go buy other </v>
<v Speaker 7>lines.</v>

530
00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:32.190
<v Speaker 7>It probably said to it,</v>
<v Speaker 7>now you can't eat a man.</v>

531
00:27:32.191 --> 00:27:34.560
<v Speaker 7>Trust me,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Jack tried a few years ago,</v>

532
00:27:34.950 --> 00:27:37.020
<v Speaker 7>doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's just impossible.</v>

533
00:27:37.021 --> 00:27:39.780
<v Speaker 7>Plus they taste like shit it don't do </v>
<v Speaker 7>it,</v>

534
00:27:39.781 --> 00:27:41.310
<v Speaker 7>man.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Just hunt antelope.</v>

535
00:27:41.311 --> 00:27:43.080
<v Speaker 7>And one of them was like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know what man?</v>

536
00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:49.100
<v Speaker 7>I've been reading Tony Robbins,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I understand that I don't have to allow </v>

537
00:27:49.771 --> 00:27:54.771
<v Speaker 7>another person's paradigm to influence </v>
<v Speaker 7>my paradigm and some of the greatest </v>

538
00:27:54.771 --> 00:27:55.170
<v Speaker 7>inventors in,</v>
<v Speaker 7>in,</v>

539
00:27:55.171 --> 00:27:59.100
<v Speaker 7>in the history of lions have been the </v>
<v Speaker 7>ones I remember,</v>

540
00:27:59.101 --> 00:28:04.101
<v Speaker 7>man,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there was a lion who figured out the </v>

541
00:28:04.101 --> 00:28:04.101
<v Speaker 7>first one to in an antelope.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Remember that guy?</v>

542
00:28:04.101 --> 00:28:04.590
<v Speaker 7>We,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we,</v>

543
00:28:04.830 --> 00:28:07.080
<v Speaker 7>he's in art history books.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Fuck it.</v>

544
00:28:07.470 --> 00:28:09.900
<v Speaker 7>I'm going to go for it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm going to put my ass on the line.</v>

545
00:28:09.901 --> 00:28:14.901
<v Speaker 7>I might get embarrassed,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but I'm going to try to eat one of the </v>

546
00:28:14.901 --> 00:28:14.901
<v Speaker 7>monkeys.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Bam.</v>

547
00:28:14.901 --> 00:28:15.540
<v Speaker 7>He did it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think it was a girl.</v>

548
00:28:16.050 --> 00:28:16.690
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean that's.</v>

549
00:28:16.770 --> 00:28:19.800
<v Speaker 7>I know hunter super advanced monkeys is </v>
<v Speaker 7>what I'm saying.</v>

550
00:28:19.801 --> 00:28:22.590
<v Speaker 7>The point is the cat.</v>
<v Speaker 7>What are all girls?</v>

551
00:28:22.620 --> 00:28:24.480
<v Speaker 7>The girls will pick up on the last.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>

552
00:28:24.481 --> 00:28:27.570
<v Speaker 7>I'm sorry for males don't really hunt.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Sorry about that.</v>

553
00:28:27.571 --> 00:28:29.520
<v Speaker 7>That often.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean they will if they have to,</v>

554
00:28:29.820 --> 00:28:32.680
<v Speaker 7>but for the most part this shit assets,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they just kick her out.</v>

555
00:28:32.681 --> 00:28:33.900
<v Speaker 7>So she was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know what?</v>

556
00:28:33.901 --> 00:28:37.470
<v Speaker 7>I'm going for it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And she did it and she learned something</v>

557
00:28:37.471 --> 00:28:41.730
<v Speaker 7>new and that particular tendril of the </v>
<v Speaker 7>biomass figured out some new thing.</v>

558
00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:46.760
<v Speaker 7>But unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the way it figured it out was through </v>

559
00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:47.800
<v Speaker 7>horror and through catastrophe.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

560
00:28:48.090 --> 00:28:51.740
<v Speaker 7>all that stuff to me is,</v>
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

561
00:28:52.530 --> 00:28:57.530
<v Speaker 7>it really does bring to mind this </v>
<v Speaker 7>incredible verse in the Bhagavad Gita </v>

562
00:28:59.341 --> 00:29:04.341
<v Speaker 7>where Krishna is revealing his true form</v>
<v Speaker 7>to our June who's like the warrior </v>

563
00:29:04.341 --> 00:29:05.320
<v Speaker 7>figure.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And uh,</v>

564
00:29:06.780 --> 00:29:10.440
<v Speaker 7>this is Oppenheimer's quote.</v>
<v Speaker 7>This is Oppenheimer's quote,</v>

565
00:29:10.441 --> 00:29:12.030
<v Speaker 7>when he,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that he said after the atomic bomb,</v>

566
00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:15.150
<v Speaker 7>when I recorded this part of the </v>
<v Speaker 7>Bhagavad Gita where he said,</v>

567
00:29:15.151 --> 00:29:17.580
<v Speaker 7>I have become death the destroyer of </v>
<v Speaker 7>worlds,</v>

568
00:29:17.910 --> 00:29:21.480
<v Speaker 7>but it doesn't stop there.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Christian sang to Argentina,</v>

569
00:29:21.690 --> 00:29:26.690
<v Speaker 7>something along the lines of,</v>
<v Speaker 7>look in my teeth there you will see </v>

570
00:29:26.690 --> 00:29:29.010
<v Speaker 7>them,</v>
<v Speaker 7>everyone on this battlefield because I'm</v>

571
00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:32.430
<v Speaker 7>eating them right now.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So this is like,</v>

572
00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:34.680
<v Speaker 7>this is like Christian being like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>oh,</v>

573
00:29:34.681 --> 00:29:39.681
<v Speaker 7>you really want to see what I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>because they've just been friends </v>

574
00:29:39.681 --> 00:29:41.040
<v Speaker 7>hanging out and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And he like suddenly became the force of</v>

575
00:29:41.050 --> 00:29:42.040
<v Speaker 7>all destruction</v>

576
00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:45.190
<v Speaker 3>in the known universe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the point of the thing was,</v>

577
00:29:45.191 --> 00:29:48.550
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of this is already chewed up.</v>

578
00:29:48.790 --> 00:29:52.120
<v Speaker 3>It's already been devoured.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's already gone.</v>

579
00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:54.430
<v Speaker 3>Game over,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're done.</v>

580
00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:57.010
<v Speaker 3>No Kurzweil's going to get you new blood</v>
<v Speaker 3>cells.</v>

581
00:29:57.011 --> 00:29:59.050
<v Speaker 3>It's going to keep going to keep you </v>
<v Speaker 3>alive.</v>

582
00:29:59.310 --> 00:30:04.310
<v Speaker 3>At some point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I will come to you wearing the costume </v>

583
00:30:04.310 --> 00:30:05.410
<v Speaker 3>of your death,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that is an inevitability.</v>

584
00:30:05.500 --> 00:30:10.500
<v Speaker 3>So just surrender to that and you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to be a lot less freaked out if </v>

585
00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:11.140
<v Speaker 3>you just accept that that's the way it </v>
<v Speaker 3>is.</v>

586
00:30:11.141 --> 00:30:13.690
<v Speaker 3>Because if you're a war that you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>engaged in right now,</v>

587
00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:18.960
<v Speaker 3>is the war to live forever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're a war that you're engaged in </v>

588
00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:22.951
<v Speaker 3>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is a war to try to make some lasting </v>

589
00:30:22.951 --> 00:30:25.870
<v Speaker 3>change in a universe that's defined by </v>
<v Speaker 3>impermanence and change,</v>

590
00:30:26.020 --> 00:30:29.050
<v Speaker 3>then you're fighting the wrong war.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a better war to fight,</v>

591
00:30:29.051 --> 00:30:34.051
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's actually the way you fight it </v>

592
00:30:34.051 --> 00:30:34.051
<v Speaker 3>is by surrendering,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not by fighting,</v>

593
00:30:34.051 --> 00:30:38.080
<v Speaker 3>by letting go and sinking into the </v>
<v Speaker 3>actual hum of the universe,</v>

594
00:30:38.081 --> 00:30:40.330
<v Speaker 3>the way it really works,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not the way you wish it were,</v>

595
00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:43.410
<v Speaker 3>not the way that you were hoping that </v>
<v Speaker 3>the universe worked where,</v>

596
00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:44.280
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

597
00:30:44.290 --> 00:30:49.290
<v Speaker 3>lions and hyenas rescue little boys like</v>
<v Speaker 3>an ice age,</v>

598
00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:53.260
<v Speaker 3>but the cartoon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the way it actually works,</v>

599
00:30:53.261 --> 00:30:56.440
<v Speaker 3>the way the universe actually works as </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything comes into existence,</v>

600
00:30:56.970 --> 00:31:00.400
<v Speaker 3>it exists for a little while and then it</v>
<v Speaker 3>dies</v>

601
00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:03.380
<v Speaker 5>than most things come out of explosions </v>
<v Speaker 5>and.</v>

602
00:31:03.420 --> 00:31:04.550
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't forget that.</v>

603
00:31:04.551 --> 00:31:09.551
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Most things come out of big fucking </v>

604
00:31:09.551 --> 00:31:09.551
<v Speaker 5>blast,</v>
<v Speaker 5>including the whole universe itself.</v>

605
00:31:09.551 --> 00:31:12.080
<v Speaker 5>The university itself is predicated upon</v>
<v Speaker 5>a violent event.</v>

606
00:31:12.170 --> 00:31:14.090
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It has to have a violent event,</v>

607
00:31:14.180 --> 00:31:15.020
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's big.</v>

608
00:31:15.021 --> 00:31:16.370
<v Speaker 5>Bang.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It couldn't be the,</v>

609
00:31:16.610 --> 00:31:21.610
<v Speaker 5>the slow expansion of beautiful life </v>
<v Speaker 5>giving particles throughout the universe</v>

610
00:31:22.611 --> 00:31:23.330
<v Speaker 5>now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nope.</v>

611
00:31:23.390 --> 00:31:24.800
<v Speaker 5>It's a big fucking bang.</v>

612
00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:30.080
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a big fucking bang and it keeps </v>

613
00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:30.080
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It keeps going.</v>

614
00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:32.790
<v Speaker 3>The Big Bang keeps going and is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's just like this man.</v>

615
00:31:32.791 --> 00:31:37.791
<v Speaker 3>If you want to dig your heels in and </v>
<v Speaker 3>sync your claws into the expanding </v>

616
00:31:39.991 --> 00:31:43.260
<v Speaker 3>universe and try to keep that fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing from expanding,</v>

617
00:31:43.410 --> 00:31:46.350
<v Speaker 3>you're going to get ripped apart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's just the way it works,</v>

618
00:31:46.770 --> 00:31:49.890
<v Speaker 3>but if you want to let go and merge into</v>
<v Speaker 3>the thing,</v>

619
00:31:50.100 --> 00:31:55.100
<v Speaker 3>if you want to allow yourself the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fantasy that you're not some individual </v>

620
00:31:55.100 --> 00:31:55.890
<v Speaker 3>with a social security number and a name</v>
<v Speaker 3>and parents,</v>

621
00:31:56.160 --> 00:32:01.160
<v Speaker 3>but allow yourself that fantasy that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're 13 point 8 billion years old and </v>

622
00:32:01.201 --> 00:32:06.201
<v Speaker 3>you're part of this incredible ocean of </v>
<v Speaker 3>happening instead of just this one </v>

623
00:32:06.201 --> 00:32:08.880
<v Speaker 3>individual and just let yourself </v>
<v Speaker 3>experience that for a second.</v>

624
00:32:09.210 --> 00:32:14.210
<v Speaker 3>The glorious knowledge that you are a </v>
<v Speaker 3>never ending ever changing flow of </v>

625
00:32:14.341 --> 00:32:19.341
<v Speaker 3>matter that's temporarily manifested </v>
<v Speaker 3>with the ability to express love and do </v>

626
00:32:19.341 --> 00:32:21.720
<v Speaker 3>a dimension where things are supposed to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be cooling off.</v>

627
00:32:22.020 --> 00:32:27.020
<v Speaker 3>Then that's a fun way to spend your time</v>
<v Speaker 3>here before you ended up getting eaten </v>

628
00:32:27.020 --> 00:32:30.090
<v Speaker 3>by a lion or have a heart attack or </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever happens.</v>

629
00:32:30.091 --> 00:32:31.740
<v Speaker 3>It's just a backflip.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a.</v>

630
00:32:32.130 --> 00:32:37.130
<v Speaker 3>This is like a high di.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is like when you see people come </v>

631
00:32:37.130 --> 00:32:39.190
<v Speaker 3>off a high dive and you get like a few </v>
<v Speaker 3>seconds to do some cool fucking tricks.</v>

632
00:32:39.620 --> 00:32:44.620
<v Speaker 3>That's what you get here were like </v>
<v Speaker 3>dolphins jumping out of the eternal and </v>

633
00:32:44.620 --> 00:32:47.150
<v Speaker 3>we into time and while we were shooting </v>
<v Speaker 3>up into time,</v>

634
00:32:47.151 --> 00:32:49.520
<v Speaker 3>we get a chance to do a couple of back </v>
<v Speaker 3>flips,</v>

635
00:32:49.521 --> 00:32:54.521
<v Speaker 3>a couple of Chirps,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's our life's work and then we </v>

636
00:32:54.521 --> 00:32:55.220
<v Speaker 3>plunged back into infinity again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do it all over again.</v>

637
00:32:55.970 --> 00:32:57.380
<v Speaker 6>What do you think,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if any,</v>

638
00:32:57.470 --> 00:33:01.820
<v Speaker 6>evolutionary advantages there are to an </v>
<v Speaker 6>identity?</v>

639
00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:05.810
<v Speaker 6>What?</v>
<v Speaker 6>What about us makes us not just identify</v>

640
00:33:05.811 --> 00:33:10.811
<v Speaker 6>ourselves,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but define ourselves with a sound and a </v>

641
00:33:10.811 --> 00:33:11.390
<v Speaker 6>symbol.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We have a series of sounds and samples.</v>

642
00:33:11.420 --> 00:33:13.100
<v Speaker 6>Duncan trussell.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

643
00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:15.140
<v Speaker 6>and there's all these letters and you </v>
<v Speaker 6>arrange them in order.</v>

644
00:33:15.141 --> 00:33:18.950
<v Speaker 6>You can even go all caps if you feeling </v>
<v Speaker 6>gangster and that's you.</v>

645
00:33:19.070 --> 00:33:20.660
<v Speaker 6>That's you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That represents you.</v>

646
00:33:20.661 --> 00:33:21.580
<v Speaker 6>It's your,</v>
<v Speaker 6>your human.</v>

647
00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:23.720
<v Speaker 6>You could carry around you with like a </v>
<v Speaker 6>little sign.</v>

648
00:33:23.900 --> 00:33:26.390
<v Speaker 6>My name is Duncan trussell.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know what I'm saying?</v>

649
00:33:26.850 --> 00:33:31.850
<v Speaker 6>It's weird and it's the at the same time</v>
<v Speaker 6>where this animal is becoming ultra </v>

650
00:33:32.691 --> 00:33:37.691
<v Speaker 6>advanced and is figuring out how to </v>
<v Speaker 6>communicate and figuring out its </v>

651
00:33:37.691 --> 00:33:41.201
<v Speaker 6>position in the world around it and it's</v>
<v Speaker 6>also figuring out that this whole </v>

652
00:33:41.201 --> 00:33:45.430
<v Speaker 6>infinite world or infinite universe they</v>
<v Speaker 6>live in is almost impossible to </v>

653
00:33:45.430 --> 00:33:47.540
<v Speaker 6>understand and as it's figuring this </v>
<v Speaker 6>out,</v>

654
00:33:48.020 --> 00:33:53.020
<v Speaker 6>it's also figuring out that it needs </v>
<v Speaker 6>community and it needs to be in these </v>

655
00:33:53.020 --> 00:33:53.330
<v Speaker 6>groups,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but somehow or another,</v>

656
00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:59.440
<v Speaker 6>some program has been put in place to </v>
<v Speaker 6>get you to work harder and try to </v>

657
00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:04.100
<v Speaker 6>achieve more by being defined by your </v>
<v Speaker 6>name,</v>

<v Speaker 6>How many shiny things do you have?</v>

691
00:35:22.100 --> 00:35:27.100
<v Speaker 6>How large is your domicile?</v>
<v Speaker 6>How big is the place where you call </v>

692
00:35:27.100 --> 00:35:27.470
<v Speaker 6>home?</v>
<v Speaker 6>How much zeros do you have?</v>

693
00:35:27.730 --> 00:35:32.730

<v Speaker 6>Mr Whitmore,</v>

696
00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:37.150
<v Speaker 6>Mr Whitmore you bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>

697
00:35:37.170 --> 00:35:38.370
<v Speaker 6>I've been working</v>

698
00:35:38.370 --> 00:35:41.940
<v Speaker 3>in the mail room since I was 14.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how I did it.</v>

699
00:35:42.110 --> 00:35:44.610
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I made good choices.</v>

700
00:35:44.611 --> 00:35:49.611
<v Speaker 3>I made a series of good discipline </v>
<v Speaker 3>decisions in my life and I've learned </v>

701
00:35:49.611 --> 00:35:50.430
<v Speaker 3>where I'm at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why I have an island.</v>

702
00:35:50.530 --> 00:35:54.240
<v Speaker 3>And Bernie Sanders.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bernie Sanders.</v>

703
00:35:54.241 --> 00:35:55.980
<v Speaker 3>What are you trying to say?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bernie Sanders.</v>

704
00:35:56.580 --> 00:35:58.440
<v Speaker 3>Damn hippies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a,</v>

705
00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:01.800
<v Speaker 3>this is what you're talking about here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

706
00:36:01.801 --> 00:36:03.360
<v Speaker 3>is really fucking cool,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

707
00:36:03.361 --> 00:36:04.160
<v Speaker 3>It's the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

708
00:36:04.620 --> 00:36:05.780
<v Speaker 3>this is the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

709
00:36:06.180 --> 00:36:08.040
<v Speaker 3>where,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you identify with?</v>

710
00:36:08.070 --> 00:36:13.070
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you're trained to identify with a </v>

711
00:36:13.070 --> 00:36:13.620
<v Speaker 3>particular costume that you call your </v>
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>

712
00:36:13.950 --> 00:36:18.950
<v Speaker 3>And so most people have gotten really </v>
<v Speaker 3>entangled and committed to that </v>

713
00:36:18.950 --> 00:36:21.150
<v Speaker 3>particular game of make believe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's,</v>

714
00:36:21.350 --> 00:36:22.350
<v Speaker 3>that's why,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

715
00:36:22.351 --> 00:36:24.800
<v Speaker 3>most everyone is really engaged in their</v>
<v Speaker 3>personality.</v>

716
00:36:24.801 --> 00:36:26.880
<v Speaker 3>They don't have to be a Mr.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wentworth or whatever.</v>

717
00:36:27.150 --> 00:36:30.380
<v Speaker 3>Whoever it more whitmore,</v>
<v Speaker 3>forgiving Mr Whitmore though.</v>

718
00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:32.460

<v Speaker 3>I forget,</v>

719
00:36:32.940 --> 00:36:34.960
<v Speaker 3>I forget what his name is.</v>

720
00:36:36.660 --> 00:36:37.770
<v Speaker 3>Mr.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Imaginary.</v>

721
00:36:38.620 --> 00:36:40.110
<v Speaker 3>It is Mr.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Imaginary.</v>

722
00:36:40.111 --> 00:36:40.860
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is the,</v>

723
00:36:40.861 --> 00:36:42.000
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the uh,</v>

724
00:36:42.870 --> 00:36:44.310
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the thing is,</v>

725
00:36:44.311 --> 00:36:45.490
<v Speaker 3>it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is now.</v>

726
00:36:45.630 --> 00:36:47.850
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is the Rom das quote.</v>

727
00:36:48.050 --> 00:36:50.640
<v Speaker 3>We are all God and drag.</v>

729
00:37:00.740 --> 00:37:01.240
<v Speaker 3>of a cost.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're,</v>

00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:04.290
<v Speaker 3>we're at a costume party and that's part</v>
<v Speaker 3>of this dimension.</v>

731
00:37:04.291 --> 00:37:06.720
<v Speaker 3>We're all wearing these funny costumes </v>
<v Speaker 3>especially now,</v>

732

<v Speaker 3>place,</v>

00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:12.630
<v Speaker 3>people are going to come up to me and be</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

735
00:37:12.631 --> 00:37:17.631
<v Speaker 3>father,</v>

<v Speaker 3>they don't know and it's just a costume.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a ridiculous costume.</v>

737
00:37:19.020 --> 00:37:21.990
<v Speaker 3>Completely meaningless.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if I wear this to enough places,</v>

738
00:37:21.991 --> 00:37:26.991
<v Speaker 3>people asked me about the drones and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>drone program or they'll try to buy </v>

739
00:37:26.991 --> 00:37:26.991

759
00:38:08.570 --> 00:38:11.750
<v Speaker 3>Not Ashamed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not sponsored by the.</v>

760
00:38:12.500 --> 00:38:15.150
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shout out to George.</v>

761
00:38:15.151 --> 00:38:15.930
<v Speaker 3>Jen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my trainer.</v>

762
00:38:15.931 --> 00:38:16.270
<v Speaker 3>I love.</v>

763
00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:20.160
<v Speaker 3>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the uh,</v>

764
00:38:20.340 --> 00:38:21.660
<v Speaker 3>the um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

765
00:38:21.750 --> 00:38:24.930
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the point is if you look underneath that</v>

766
00:38:24.931 --> 00:38:25.830
<v Speaker 3>layer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

767
00:38:25.930 --> 00:38:28.500
<v Speaker 3>That's where shit gets interesting </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you're,</v>

768
00:38:28.501 --> 00:38:33.501
<v Speaker 3>you're trying to go from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>entanglement with your personality to </v>

769
00:38:34.050 --> 00:38:39.050
<v Speaker 3>recognizing that you're observing </v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself in the same way you observe a </v>

770
00:38:39.050 --> 00:38:39.050
<v Speaker 3>pen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if you sit,</v>

771
00:38:39.050 --> 00:38:40.480
<v Speaker 3>if you look at a pen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

772
00:38:40.481 --> 00:38:41.080
<v Speaker 3>Oh wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

773
00:38:41.081 --> 00:38:42.310
<v Speaker 3>here's a pen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can see it.</v>

774
00:38:42.311 --> 00:38:44.050
<v Speaker 3>I can feel it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know what it is.</v>

775
00:38:44.051 --> 00:38:45.610
<v Speaker 3>In the same way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you think,</v>

776
00:38:45.611 --> 00:38:47.200
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like shit today,</v>

777
00:38:47.530 --> 00:38:52.530
<v Speaker 3>you're observing feeling like shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't feel like shit any more than </v>

778
00:38:52.530 --> 00:38:53.410
<v Speaker 3>you're the pen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're just in the ear.</v>

779
00:38:53.411 --> 00:38:58.411
<v Speaker 3>Experiencing it within your field of </v>
<v Speaker 3>awareness is that thing that you call </v>

780
00:38:58.411 --> 00:39:01.540
<v Speaker 3>feeling like shit or feeling happy or </v>
<v Speaker 3>feeling sad or feeling good.</v>

781
00:39:01.810 --> 00:39:04.540
<v Speaker 3>You're aware of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So now you've zoomed back a step,</v>

782
00:39:04.541 --> 00:39:04.870
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

783
00:39:05.020 --> 00:39:07.990
<v Speaker 3>And you've become the observer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Ottman,</v>

784
00:39:08.170 --> 00:39:13.170
<v Speaker 3>and that's what you truly are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that is known as the thing that you </v>

785
00:39:13.170 --> 00:39:16.051
<v Speaker 3>can't look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the thing that is they can't see </v>

786
00:39:16.051 --> 00:39:17.140
<v Speaker 3>itself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It only gazes is out.</v>

787
00:39:17.141 --> 00:39:19.570
<v Speaker 3>It's also known as the watcher or the </v>
<v Speaker 3>witness.</v>

788
00:39:19.900 --> 00:39:22.010
<v Speaker 3>But that's what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

789
00:39:22.040 --> 00:39:23.010
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

790
00:39:23.170 --> 00:39:28.170
<v Speaker 3>for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I take the right quantity of lsd and </v>

791
00:39:28.170 --> 00:39:31.510
<v Speaker 3>I allow myself some time alone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then I can merge into that state.</v>

792
00:39:31.780 --> 00:39:36.780
<v Speaker 3>And that's the unified merging into </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything as that people often report </v>

793
00:39:36.851 --> 00:39:41.851
<v Speaker 3>on a psychedelic experiences you popped </v>
<v Speaker 3>backwards into instead of being the </v>

794
00:39:42.010 --> 00:39:46.180
<v Speaker 3>object or rather the subject and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>object merge together.</v>

795
00:39:46.181 --> 00:39:51.181
<v Speaker 3>So there's no more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no more of that which is </v>

796
00:39:51.181 --> 00:39:52.030
<v Speaker 3>observed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but only an everything this,</v>

797
00:39:52.060 --> 00:39:57.060
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's what our personalities keep </v>

798
00:39:57.060 --> 00:39:57.060
<v Speaker 3>us from experiencing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And a lot of in Buddhism,</v>

799
00:39:57.060 --> 00:40:00.100
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people claim that we cling to </v>
<v Speaker 3>our personalities.</v>

800
00:40:00.330 --> 00:40:03.130
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the same way a person would clean to</v>

801
00:40:03.131 --> 00:40:08.131
<v Speaker 3>a pole over a floor covered in razor </v>
<v Speaker 3>blades because the experience of having </v>

802
00:40:10.330 --> 00:40:15.330
<v Speaker 3>a self or an identity for a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>people is preferable to the experience </v>

803
00:40:15.881 --> 00:40:20.881
<v Speaker 3>of merging into everything because </v>
<v Speaker 3>merging into everything is death and a </v>

804
00:40:20.891 --> 00:40:24.400
<v Speaker 3>lot of people don't want to die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's really curious though,</v>

805
00:40:24.401 --> 00:40:26.800
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of like exercises designed</v>

806
00:40:26.801 --> 00:40:31.801
<v Speaker 3>to move you out of that attachment to </v>
<v Speaker 3>your bodily identification because it's </v>

807
00:40:31.801 --> 00:40:32.490
<v Speaker 3>not just what you're wearing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's your body.</v>

808
00:40:32.590 --> 00:40:33.940
<v Speaker 3>People think their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their body.</v>

809
00:40:34.390 --> 00:40:36.880
<v Speaker 3>That's one of the first things you learn</v>
<v Speaker 3>as you're not your body.</v>

810
00:40:37.120 --> 00:40:39.190
<v Speaker 3>You just think you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what you are.</v>

811
00:40:39.191 --> 00:40:41.110
<v Speaker 3>You're not your body anymore than you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>a pen.</v>

812
00:40:41.410 --> 00:40:46.410
<v Speaker 3>You're not your body anymore than you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>a airplane or you're not your body </v>

813
00:40:46.410 --> 00:40:47.410
<v Speaker 3>anymore than your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your car.</v>

814
00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:51.730
<v Speaker 3>It's just a vehicle within which you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>currently experiencing the universe.</v>

815
00:40:51.731 --> 00:40:53.590
<v Speaker 3>It's really trippy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

816
00:40:53.770 --> 00:40:54.850
<v Speaker 3>It's really fucking tripping.</v>

817
00:40:56.740 --> 00:41:01.740
<v Speaker 5>Being a human being and knowing that you</v>
<v Speaker 5>only have a certain amount of time here </v>

818
00:41:01.740 --> 00:41:02.960

<v Speaker 5>things,</v>

820
00:41:06.020 --> 00:41:07.760
<v Speaker 5>but at the end of doing all those </v>
<v Speaker 5>things,</v>

821
00:41:07.761 --> 00:41:11.960
<v Speaker 5>if your body just stops working,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like what was really the point of this?</v>

822
00:41:12.290 --> 00:41:17.290
<v Speaker 5>What was the point of this?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is it to leave behind a lot of </v>

823
00:41:17.290 --> 00:41:17.290
<v Speaker 5>paperwork?</v>
<v Speaker 5>W,</v>

<v Speaker 5>W,</v>

827
00:41:26.141 --> 00:41:31.120
<v Speaker 5>were trying.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean if you tried to understand the </v>

828
00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:34.070
<v Speaker 5>all the major religions,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all the ideologies that human</v>

<v Speaker 6>beings subscribe to the varying ones all</v>
<v Speaker 6>over the world.</v>

830
00:41:38.210 --> 00:41:43.210
<v Speaker 6>You looked at some key components and </v>
<v Speaker 6>there's all the key components that are </v>

831
00:41:43.370 --> 00:41:46.850
<v Speaker 6>sort of undeniable and the good and evil</v>
<v Speaker 6>are in every one of them.</v>

<v Speaker 6>but if you.</v>

834
00:41:50.541 --> 00:41:54.800
<v Speaker 6>If you looked at human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I completely objective and you looked at</v>

835
00:41:54.801 --> 00:41:56.210
<v Speaker 6>things like war.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you could,</v>

836
00:41:56.780 --> 00:42:00.290
<v Speaker 6>if you could look at the entire human </v>
<v Speaker 6>race and then focus in on something like</v>

837
00:42:00.291 --> 00:42:05.291
<v Speaker 6>Afghanistan and then have like a brain </v>
<v Speaker 6>map that would show like all the </v>

838
00:42:05.291 --> 00:42:09.491
<v Speaker 6>thoughts involved of all the people all </v>
<v Speaker 6>over the world that contributed to this </v>

00:42:09.491 --> 00:42:12.851
<v Speaker 6>one event happening were explosions are </v>
<v Speaker 6>going off and robots or flying through </v>

<v Speaker 6>whoa.</v>

845
00:42:25.730 --> 00:42:27.290
<v Speaker 6>If you could look at that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you would say,</v>

<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's the devil.</v>

00:45:31.710 --> 00:45:33.300
<v Speaker 6>but you have it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you're in love with someone,</v>

924
00:45:33.330 --> 00:45:34.380
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>everybody gets that.</v>

925
00:45:34.381 --> 00:45:39.381
<v Speaker 6>It doesn't matter if you're rich.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It doesn't matter if you're successful </v>

926
00:45:39.381 --> 00:45:42.470
<v Speaker 6>if you don't have that one moment where </v>
<v Speaker 6>you really enjoy being with someone who </v>

927
00:45:42.470 --> 00:45:44.640
<v Speaker 6>really enjoys being with you and you </v>
<v Speaker 6>have this like a rush of love,</v>

928
00:45:44.670 --> 00:45:46.530
<v Speaker 6>whether it's your family,</v>
<v Speaker 6>with your mom,</v>

929
00:45:46.531 --> 00:45:47.950
<v Speaker 6>seeing senior mother,</v>
<v Speaker 6>even your dog,</v>

930
00:45:47.970 --> 00:45:48.780
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>whether yeah,</v>

931
00:45:48.781 --> 00:45:49.220
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>
<v Speaker 6>any.</v>

932
00:45:49.540 --> 00:45:50.580
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>not your dog.</v>

933
00:45:51.930 --> 00:45:52.770
<v Speaker 6>It's not strong.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

934
00:45:52.860 --> 00:45:54.630
<v Speaker 6>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I disagree.</v>

935
00:45:54.690 --> 00:45:57.600
<v Speaker 6>I fundamentally disagree with you on </v>
<v Speaker 6>that point.</v>

936
00:45:57.840 --> 00:46:01.200
<v Speaker 6>I don't think that there's any hierarchy</v>
<v Speaker 6>when it comes to love and I and,</v>

937
00:46:01.220 --> 00:46:05.520
<v Speaker 6>and I think a dog is like having a love </v>
<v Speaker 6>heater and your house.</v>

938
00:46:05.550 --> 00:46:06.690
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I definitely love dogs.</v>

939
00:46:06.691 --> 00:46:07.560
<v Speaker 6>Do.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Don't get me wrong.</v>

940
00:46:07.950 --> 00:46:12.950
<v Speaker 6>The difference between the love that you</v>
<v Speaker 6>have for a dog and the love that you </v>

941
00:46:12.950 --> 00:46:12.950
<v Speaker 6>would have for your daughter is </v>
<v Speaker 6>monumental.</v>

942
00:46:12.950 --> 00:46:17.750
<v Speaker 6>It's so hard to grasp until the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and I don't like to pull that card like </v>

943
00:46:17.750 --> 00:46:18.990
<v Speaker 6>you don't know until it happens to you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

944
00:46:18.991 --> 00:46:23.991
<v Speaker 6>You don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Nobody's putting their daughters to </v>

945
00:46:23.991 --> 00:46:26.241
<v Speaker 6>sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's just a little human being that </v>

946
00:46:26.241 --> 00:46:26.241
<v Speaker 6>you're raising and your communicate </v>
<v Speaker 6>with.</v>

947
00:46:26.241 --> 00:46:29.310
<v Speaker 6>You have those very insane connection </v>
<v Speaker 6>with them and it it,</v>

948
00:46:29.311 --> 00:46:34.311
<v Speaker 6>it gives you this weird empathy for all </v>
<v Speaker 6>the rest of the people in the world </v>

949
00:46:34.311 --> 00:46:37.450
<v Speaker 6>because all the sudden they start to </v>
<v Speaker 6>look like children like they,</v>

950
00:46:37.460 --> 00:46:40.950
<v Speaker 6>they,</v>
<v Speaker 6>everyone to me is a child that became an</v>

951
00:46:40.951 --> 00:46:43.080
<v Speaker 6>adult.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Whereas they used to just be adults that</v>

952
00:46:43.081 --> 00:46:44.870
<v Speaker 6>used to exist in a static state.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

953
00:46:44.880 --> 00:46:47.820
<v Speaker 6>You would meet the 60 year old douche </v>
<v Speaker 6>bag and you go,</v>

954
00:46:47.821 --> 00:46:49.710
<v Speaker 6>this will.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This guy's a fucking piece of shit.</v>

955
00:46:49.770 --> 00:46:51.120
<v Speaker 6>That's just who he is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

956
00:46:51.121 --> 00:46:56.121
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but how did he become this 60 year old </v>

957
00:46:56.121 --> 00:46:56.121
<v Speaker 6>piece of shit?</v>

958
00:46:56.121 --> 00:46:56.121
<v Speaker 6>This,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this 60 year old piece of shit was a six</v>

959
00:46:56.121 --> 00:47:00.441
<v Speaker 6>day old baby.</v>
<v Speaker 6>At one point there was a series of </v>

960
00:47:00.441 --> 00:47:00.600
<v Speaker 6>events.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's shit genetics.</v>

961
00:47:00.601 --> 00:47:02.910
<v Speaker 6>There's poor upbringing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This bad environment.</v>

962
00:47:02.911 --> 00:47:05.640
<v Speaker 6>There's fill in the blanks.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So that led to this guy being an asshole</v>

963
00:47:05.641 --> 00:47:07.500
<v Speaker 6>in front of you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Sixty years old.</v>

964
00:47:07.520 --> 00:47:08.720
<v Speaker 6>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but you're.</v>

965
00:47:08.780 --> 00:47:10.530
<v Speaker 6>You're not thinking of that when you </v>
<v Speaker 6>meet him,</v>

966
00:47:10.590 --> 00:47:11.460
<v Speaker 6>you're just thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

967
00:47:11.461 --> 00:47:14.100
<v Speaker 6>here's an asshole with almost every </v>
<v Speaker 6>asshole.</v>

968
00:47:14.101 --> 00:47:19.101
<v Speaker 6>Almost every person that you run into is</v>
<v Speaker 6>a victim of a series of events that have</v>

969
00:47:19.771 --> 00:47:23.130
<v Speaker 6>brought them to this point,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and for some people it's just an.</v>

970
00:47:23.280 --> 00:47:24.630
<v Speaker 6>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's undealable.</v>

971
00:47:24.631 --> 00:47:27.210
<v Speaker 6>They've lost so many times.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like if you play video games,</v>

972
00:47:27.211 --> 00:47:29.100
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 6>say if you and I played video games,</v>

973
00:47:29.440 --> 00:47:31.390
<v Speaker 6>I don't play starcraft.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If I play starcraft with you,</v>

974
00:47:31.391 --> 00:47:34.660
<v Speaker 6>I'd probably get my fucking ass beat </v>
<v Speaker 6>over and over and over and over again.</v>

975
00:47:34.660 --> 00:47:37.130
<v Speaker 6>So bad I would.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm sure I would be.</v>

976
00:47:37.320 --> 00:47:39.280
<v Speaker 6>So it'd be frustrated and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>fuck dude,</v>

977
00:47:39.281 --> 00:47:41.070
<v Speaker 6>I don't want to do this anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

978
00:47:41.080 --> 00:47:46.080
<v Speaker 6>some people that's life.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Some people life is giving them the real</v>

979
00:47:46.121 --> 00:47:49.960
<v Speaker 6>life everyday beating that you don't </v>
<v Speaker 6>even liking a video game.</v>

980
00:47:50.110 --> 00:47:51.940
<v Speaker 6>Video Games are fun,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

981
00:47:51.941 --> 00:47:55.150
<v Speaker 6>but if you're playing a video game,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're just getting someone just running</v>

982
00:47:55.151 --> 00:47:56.950
<v Speaker 6>you down.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's not fun.</v>

983
00:47:57.060 --> 00:47:58.750
<v Speaker 6>It's not fun because you don't get any </v>
<v Speaker 6>of the joy.</v>

984
00:47:59.040 --> 00:48:02.740
<v Speaker 6>You get all the losing in life.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Some people,</v>

985
00:48:02.890 --> 00:48:06.070
<v Speaker 6>that's their fucking shitty hand that </v>
<v Speaker 6>they're dealt and before you know what?</v>

986
00:48:06.071 --> 00:48:10.330
<v Speaker 6>They're 13 and now they're in high </v>
<v Speaker 6>school and they're just beat down by all</v>

987
00:48:10.331 --> 00:48:15.331
<v Speaker 6>the bullshit they've experienced their </v>
<v Speaker 6>whole life and then they get to high </v>

988
00:48:15.331 --> 00:48:19.681
<v Speaker 6>school and now there's bullies.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Now there's girls and now girls fucking </v>

989
00:48:19.681 --> 00:48:19.681
<v Speaker 6>hate them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh Great.</v>

990
00:48:19.681 --> 00:48:20.140
<v Speaker 6>It gets even worse.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

991
00:48:20.141 --> 00:48:21.970
<v Speaker 6>now I have a boner that nobody wants to </v>
<v Speaker 6>deal with.</v>

992
00:48:22.310 --> 00:48:24.880
<v Speaker 6>You just that's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's the game.</v>

993
00:48:25.060 --> 00:48:30.060
<v Speaker 6>This is the game of life and sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 6>people come in and they just spawn in a </v>

994
00:48:30.060 --> 00:48:31.960
<v Speaker 6>shitty area with a real weak gun and </v>
<v Speaker 6>they like,</v>

995
00:48:31.961 --> 00:48:36.961
<v Speaker 6>fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You may have to run from the fucking </v>

996
00:48:36.961 --> 00:48:39.550
<v Speaker 6>respond spot to find a better gun on him</v>
<v Speaker 6>and put it all together and some of them</v>

997
00:48:39.551 --> 00:48:42.130
<v Speaker 6>die along the way.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's just the reality.</v>

998
00:48:42.190 --> 00:48:42.810
<v Speaker 6>That's true.</v>

999
00:48:44.300 --> 00:48:47.210
<v Speaker 7>A lot of people have a very rough man </v>
<v Speaker 7>and a lot of people that,</v>

1000
00:48:47.410 --> 00:48:50.390
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>a lot of people listening to this are so</v>

1001
00:48:50.391 --> 00:48:55.391
<v Speaker 7>fucking hard on themselves and they </v>
<v Speaker 7>don't apply the exact same thing that </v>

1002
00:48:55.391 --> 00:48:56.360
<v Speaker 7>you're saying to apply to other people </v>
<v Speaker 7>do their own lives.</v>

1003
00:48:56.510 --> 00:49:01.510
<v Speaker 7>Like so many people feel so guilty.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So like they wake up in the morning and </v>

1004
00:49:01.611 --> 00:49:06.611
<v Speaker 7>they think about some dumb fucking thing</v>
<v Speaker 7>they did whenever they did it for </v>

1005
00:49:06.611 --> 00:49:10.151
<v Speaker 7>whatever dumb reason,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and they feel all this guilt and they </v>

1006
00:49:10.151 --> 00:49:13.211
<v Speaker 7>walk around like a dog with a droopy </v>
<v Speaker 7>tail because they don't think they </v>

1007
00:49:13.211 --> 00:49:16.931
<v Speaker 7>deserve love.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And so I think that you to get to the </v>

1008
00:49:16.931 --> 00:49:18.560
<v Speaker 7>place you're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which is a fucking awesome place,</v>

1009
00:49:19.160 --> 00:49:24.160
<v Speaker 7>empathy for all human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 7>loving everyone to the best of your </v>

1010
00:49:24.160 --> 00:49:26.420
<v Speaker 7>ability.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You got to start with the person closest</v>

1011
00:49:26.421 --> 00:49:27.020
<v Speaker 7>to you,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

1012
00:49:27.290 --> 00:49:29.990
<v Speaker 7>And that's your you.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's your life.</v>

1013
00:49:29.991 --> 00:49:32.810
<v Speaker 7>Like you have to figure out a way to sit</v>
<v Speaker 7>down,</v>

1014
00:49:33.050 --> 00:49:36.500
<v Speaker 7>take an appraisal of your life.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Don't skip anything,</v>

1015
00:49:36.501 --> 00:49:41.501
<v Speaker 7>don't ignore anything.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Look at the whole way that you're </v>

1016
00:49:41.501 --> 00:49:44.021
<v Speaker 7>playing the entire game and understand </v>
<v Speaker 7>that all the things that you've done </v>

1017
00:49:44.021 --> 00:49:47.861
<v Speaker 7>that are stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what the fuck did you expect yourself to</v>

1018
00:49:48.891 --> 00:49:53.891
<v Speaker 7>do?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like you're temporarily existing in a </v>

1019
00:49:53.891 --> 00:49:56.531
<v Speaker 7>dimension that is actively destroying </v>
<v Speaker 7>you and every single moment you're not </v>

1020
00:49:56.531 --> 00:49:58.640
<v Speaker 7>going to be perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Give yourself a break.</v>

1021
00:49:58.850 --> 00:50:01.190
<v Speaker 7>So you start with that and then once you</v>
<v Speaker 7>start,</v>

1022
00:50:01.660 --> 00:50:04.550
<v Speaker 7>you know when whatever the.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Everyone's got a thing and I'm right.</v>

1023
00:50:04.580 --> 00:50:08.420
<v Speaker 7>Everybody has a thing inside of them </v>
<v Speaker 7>they don't like about themselves.</v>

1024
00:50:08.421 --> 00:50:13.421
<v Speaker 7>Maybe not you,</v>
<v Speaker 7>or maybe that thing has been reduced to </v>

1025
00:50:13.421 --> 00:50:13.421
<v Speaker 7>some degree,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but a lot of people,</v>

1026
00:50:13.421 --> 00:50:15.620
<v Speaker 7>they think they're too fat.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They think they're too thin.</v>

1027
00:50:15.620 --> 00:50:20.620
<v Speaker 7>They think that their tattoos,</v>
<v Speaker 7>socks or they regret the way that they </v>

1028
00:50:20.620 --> 00:50:24.041
<v Speaker 7>treated their parents or they feel like </v>
<v Speaker 7>they're not far enough ahead in their </v>

1029
00:50:24.041 --> 00:50:24.590
<v Speaker 7>career.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Whatever the fucking thing it is,</v>

1030
00:50:24.591 --> 00:50:29.591
<v Speaker 7>man,</v>
<v Speaker 7>everybody has this aspect of themselves </v>

1031
00:50:29.591 --> 00:50:30.030
<v Speaker 7>that really unhappy with.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So if you.</v>

1032
00:50:30.800 --> 00:50:33.290
<v Speaker 7>What if you.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If you get really honest about the parts</v>

1033
00:50:33.291 --> 00:50:34.640
<v Speaker 7>of yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you're unhappy about,</v>

1034
00:50:35.330 --> 00:50:40.330
<v Speaker 7>the new will.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Be excited to learn that you've been </v>

1035
00:50:41.811 --> 00:50:46.811
<v Speaker 7>being attacked by those aspects of </v>
<v Speaker 7>yourself in the form of everyone you </v>

1036
00:50:46.811 --> 00:50:50.111
<v Speaker 7>think's an asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So it's like you're projecting those </v>

1037
00:50:50.111 --> 00:50:50.630
<v Speaker 7>parts of yourself out onto the world.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So all the people where you're like,</v>

1038
00:50:50.631 --> 00:50:52.370
<v Speaker 7>man,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that guy's a fucking douche bag.</v>

1039
00:50:52.640 --> 00:50:57.640
<v Speaker 7>Why would he ever fucking act like that </v>
<v Speaker 7>and can't believe that guy did that </v>

1040
00:50:57.640 --> 00:51:00.581
<v Speaker 7>fucking shit?</v>
<v Speaker 7>If you stop and think really hard about </v>

1041
00:51:00.581 --> 00:51:04.121
<v Speaker 7>yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you'll discover that you are guilty of </v>

1042
00:51:04.121 --> 00:51:05.150
<v Speaker 7>those very same crimes generally,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and if you weren't,</v>

1043
00:51:05.151 --> 00:51:06.380
<v Speaker 7>you wouldn't even notice it.</v>

1044
00:51:06.590 --> 00:51:09.050
<v Speaker 7>You just are seeing parts of yourself </v>
<v Speaker 7>you can't quite address.</v>

1045
00:51:09.230 --> 00:51:13.280
<v Speaker 7>So the optimistic thing about this </v>
<v Speaker 7>concept of loving everyone or getting to</v>

1046
00:51:13.281 --> 00:51:16.940
<v Speaker 7>the place of loving everyone is that if </v>
<v Speaker 7>you can figure out how to love yourself,</v>

1047
00:51:17.480 --> 00:51:22.480
<v Speaker 7>it's very similar to wiping dog shit off</v>
<v Speaker 7>your shoe because if you have dog shit </v>

1048
00:51:23.541 --> 00:51:25.430
<v Speaker 7>on your shoe,</v>
<v Speaker 7>everywhere you go,</v>

1049
00:51:25.431 --> 00:51:30.431
<v Speaker 7>smells like shit.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And if you allow yourself that delusion </v>

1050
00:51:30.711 --> 00:51:33.710
<v Speaker 7>that the reason everywhere it smells </v>
<v Speaker 7>like shit is because dog shit must be on</v>

1051
00:51:33.711 --> 00:51:35.840
<v Speaker 7>every single surface and this entire </v>
<v Speaker 7>planet.</v>

1052
00:51:36.320 --> 00:51:40.490
<v Speaker 7>Then you're going to be in hell.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But what a glorious moment when you look</v>

1053
00:51:40.491 --> 00:51:41.530
<v Speaker 7>at your shoe and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>oh,</v>

1054
00:51:41.870 --> 00:51:46.870
<v Speaker 7>just shit on my shoe.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The entire planet isn't covered with </v>

1055
00:51:46.870 --> 00:51:46.870
<v Speaker 7>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's actually just shit on my shoe.</v>

1056
00:51:46.870 --> 00:51:51.110
<v Speaker 7>And like in the same way,</v>
<v Speaker 7>once you recognize that there's a little</v>

1057
00:51:51.111 --> 00:51:56.111
<v Speaker 7>piece of Karmic dog shit that's gotten </v>
<v Speaker 7>stuck inside of your life,</v>

1058
00:51:56.660 --> 00:52:01.660
<v Speaker 7>and instead of hating that piece of dog </v>
<v Speaker 7>shit by torturing the people around you </v>

1059
00:52:01.660 --> 00:52:03.380
<v Speaker 7>and manifest the same propensity you </v>
<v Speaker 7>dislike and yourself,</v>

1060
00:52:03.770 --> 00:52:08.770
<v Speaker 7>you forgive that part of yourself and </v>
<v Speaker 7>actively learn to love it or at least </v>

1061
00:52:08.770 --> 00:52:13.481
<v Speaker 7>just understand that it's there because </v>
<v Speaker 7>it was trying to protect you when you </v>

1062
00:52:13.481 --> 00:52:17.171
<v Speaker 7>were a kid and it manifested as a </v>
<v Speaker 7>callous to keep you from whoever was </v>

1063
00:52:17.171 --> 00:52:17.171
<v Speaker 7>fucking with you.</v>

1064
00:52:17.171 --> 00:52:20.240
<v Speaker 7>And that's why you don't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It'll shift a little bit,</v>

1065
00:52:20.241 --> 00:52:25.241
<v Speaker 7>man,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and you will notice a significant </v>

1066
00:52:25.241 --> 00:52:26.540
<v Speaker 7>reduction in swarms of assholes that </v>
<v Speaker 7>were previously surrounding you.</v>

1067
00:52:26.690 --> 00:52:30.080
<v Speaker 7>It's a fascinating thing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Suddenly people just stopped bugging you</v>

1068
00:52:30.081 --> 00:52:33.140
<v Speaker 7>as much and that's because you've gotten</v>
<v Speaker 7>into yourself and you said,</v>

1069
00:52:33.170 --> 00:52:36.170
<v Speaker 7>I love you.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You did the best you could do.</v>

1070
00:52:36.920 --> 00:52:39.950
<v Speaker 7>You didn't know you're half asleep.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You're a fucking drunk.</v>

1071
00:52:40.660 --> 00:52:43.800
<v Speaker 6>So do you think,</v>
<v Speaker 6>do you attract assholes when you,</v>

1072
00:52:43.870 --> 00:52:48.010
<v Speaker 6>you have this feeling or do you think </v>
<v Speaker 6>that if you,</v>

1073
00:52:48.520 --> 00:52:53.520
<v Speaker 6>if you allow yourself forgiveness,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that you will relax and you will feel </v>

1074
00:52:53.771 --> 00:52:58.771
<v Speaker 6>different with how you interact with </v>
<v Speaker 6>people and then people will have a less </v>

1075
00:52:58.771 --> 00:53:00.440
<v Speaker 6>assholes reaction to you?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like is it,</v>

1076
00:53:00.900 --> 00:53:03.240
<v Speaker 7>I love to believe that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that you just said,</v>

1077
00:53:03.241 --> 00:53:05.100
<v Speaker 7>I love to think that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm sorry.</v>

1078
00:53:05.101 --> 00:53:06.630
<v Speaker 7>Are you skeptics out there?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Man,</v>

1079
00:53:06.631 --> 00:53:08.640
<v Speaker 7>please correct me on this.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I know I'm wrong.</v>

1080
00:53:08.880 --> 00:53:13.880
<v Speaker 7>Someone's already corrected me on this,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but I love the observer effect concept </v>

1081
00:53:13.880 --> 00:53:17.511
<v Speaker 7>that the tool actually seems to be </v>
<v Speaker 7>having an effect on the experiment and </v>

1082
00:53:17.511 --> 00:53:17.740
<v Speaker 7>that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

1083
00:53:17.910 --> 00:53:19.590
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's been explained to me.</v>

1084
00:53:19.591 --> 00:53:22.980
<v Speaker 7>If I can buy my friend j dot who's an </v>
<v Speaker 7>actual physicists dammit,</v>

1085
00:53:23.010 --> 00:53:25.620
<v Speaker 7>here.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And what he said by secret,</v>

1086
00:53:26.070 --> 00:53:31.070
<v Speaker 1>he said that it's really a disingenuous </v>
<v Speaker 1>comparison because when you are </v>

1087
00:53:31.070 --> 00:53:33.060
<v Speaker 1>measuring something and you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well it's,</v>

1088
00:53:33.090 --> 00:53:35.190
<v Speaker 1>it's different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you measure it,</v>

1089
00:53:35.430 --> 00:53:40.430
<v Speaker 1>well you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're involving some sort of form of </v>

1090
00:53:40.430 --> 00:53:40.430
<v Speaker 1>measurement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some sort of tool.</v>

1091
00:53:40.430 --> 00:53:42.900
<v Speaker 1>It's interacting with that and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>changing what it is.</v>

1092
00:53:43.170 --> 00:53:48.170
<v Speaker 1>He's like this idea that it's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>observer and you have some sort of a </v>

1093
00:53:48.170 --> 00:53:51.200
<v Speaker 1>cycle that it's disingenuous because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're observing it and in the process </v>

1094
00:53:51.721 --> 00:53:53.820
<v Speaker 1>of observing the way he's describing it </v>
<v Speaker 1>to me,</v>

1095
00:53:53.821 --> 00:53:56.100
<v Speaker 1>and I'm sure I'm butchering it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wish I call him right now,</v>

1096
00:53:56.670 --> 00:54:01.670
<v Speaker 1>but just observing it itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you're measuring it in the process </v>

1097
00:54:01.670 --> 00:54:01.820
<v Speaker 1>of measuring it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

1098
00:54:01.910 --> 00:54:03.000
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're changing,</v>

1099
00:54:03.001 --> 00:54:05.370
<v Speaker 1>you're interacting with this level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got to change it.</v>

1100
00:54:05.371 --> 00:54:07.320
<v Speaker 1>Just the one how you're interacting with</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1101
00:54:07.380 --> 00:54:08.910
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise you couldn't be measuring it.</v>

1102
00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:09.570
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1103
00:54:09.600 --> 00:54:10.820
<v Speaker 1>here's another that makes sense.</v>

1104
00:54:10.850 --> 00:54:12.720
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how he described it to me.</v>

1105
00:54:13.080 --> 00:54:15.330
<v Speaker 1>Another way to put it would be human </v>
<v Speaker 1>beings,</v>

1106
00:54:16.140 --> 00:54:18.630
<v Speaker 1>an energy form right there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just an energy form,</v>

1107
00:54:19.050 --> 00:54:23.010
<v Speaker 1>and if you react with energy in varying </v>
<v Speaker 1>ways,</v>

1108
00:54:23.011 --> 00:54:25.530
<v Speaker 1>it's going to change the way that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>interacts with you.</v>

1109
00:54:25.560 --> 00:54:28.920
<v Speaker 1>That's just how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you like,</v>

1110
00:54:28.921 --> 00:54:30.720
<v Speaker 1>if you're on ecstasy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1111
00:54:30.721 --> 00:54:34.890
<v Speaker 1>Let's say you've taken a nice dose of </v>
<v Speaker 1>mdms and you'd go out into the world,</v>

1112
00:54:34.891 --> 00:54:37.980
<v Speaker 1>just run your errands on ecstasy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't drive getting you up or whatever.</v>

1113
00:54:38.130 --> 00:54:40.650
<v Speaker 1>So now you're feeling so great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>affable,</v>

1114
00:54:40.651 --> 00:54:45.651
<v Speaker 1>empathetic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're smiling and you might notice </v>

1115
00:54:45.651 --> 00:54:49.041
<v Speaker 1>that as you go through the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are going to be smiling back at </v>

1116
00:54:49.041 --> 00:54:52.281
<v Speaker 1>you because you're putting out such a </v>
<v Speaker 1>good vibe that people are going to be </v>

1117
00:54:52.281 --> 00:54:52.890
<v Speaker 1>responding to that vibe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they won't know why.</v>

1118
00:54:53.280 --> 00:54:58.280
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm think we've talked about this in </v>

1119
00:54:58.280 --> 00:55:00.080
<v Speaker 1>your product asked before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've actually heard that and I'm </v>

1120
00:55:00.080 --> 00:55:00.870
<v Speaker 1>going to butcher this quote and I don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>know fucking said it,</v>

1121
00:55:00.871 --> 00:55:05.160
<v Speaker 1>but something along the lines of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>earth is like a dog.</v>

1122
00:55:05.580 --> 00:55:08.610
<v Speaker 1>And if you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're afraid of the universe,</v>

1123
00:55:08.611 --> 00:55:11.670
<v Speaker 1>it'll snarl and attack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you love the universe,</v>

1124
00:55:11.671 --> 00:55:14.130
<v Speaker 1>it'll roll over on its back and show you</v>
<v Speaker 1>its belly.</v>

1125
00:55:14.370 --> 00:55:18.720
<v Speaker 1>And in the same way I think that if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>go into the world with this love in your</v>

1126
00:55:18.721 --> 00:55:23.721
<v Speaker 1>heart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then for whatever reason people sense </v>

1127
00:55:23.721 --> 00:55:23.880
<v Speaker 1>that maybe it's a pheromone you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>releasing.</v>

1128
00:55:23.881 --> 00:55:28.881
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's the particular an effect that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have who knows affectation,</v>

1129
00:55:29.011 --> 00:55:32.100
<v Speaker 1>but they you're going to change the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world around you.</v>

1130
00:55:32.460 --> 00:55:33.600
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

1131
00:55:33.680 --> 00:55:36.600
<v Speaker 1>I think that whatever that the reason </v>
<v Speaker 1>for that is,</v>

1132
00:55:36.930 --> 00:55:41.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you could come up with it </v>
<v Speaker 1>depending on what your particular field </v>

1133
00:55:41.930 --> 00:55:45.530
<v Speaker 1>of or your particular interest is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can go down to the level of the </v>

1134
00:55:45.530 --> 00:55:49.731
<v Speaker 1>secret and say that the fact that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>are loving everything is transforming </v>

1135
00:55:49.731 --> 00:55:53.781
<v Speaker 1>everything into love.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or You could go to a sociological </v>

1136
00:55:53.781 --> 00:55:53.910
<v Speaker 1>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is that you just figured out a way</v>

1137
00:55:53.911 --> 00:55:58.911
<v Speaker 1>to manipulate your species by putting </v>
<v Speaker 1>out a kind of happy pheromone that makes</v>

1138
00:55:59.761 --> 00:56:03.330
<v Speaker 1>people trust you and less likely to </v>
<v Speaker 1>attack because they're not on guard.</v>

1139
00:56:03.540 --> 00:56:05.400
<v Speaker 1>You get to pick which way you want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>look at it,</v>

1140
00:56:05.401 --> 00:56:10.401
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's no question about it that </v>

1141
00:56:10.401 --> 00:56:12.740
<v Speaker 1>that totally makes sense in some way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it totally makes sense in some way </v>

1142
00:56:12.740 --> 00:56:14.370
<v Speaker 1>that the actual pheromone or the actual </v>
<v Speaker 1>vibe,</v>

1143
00:56:14.400 --> 00:56:15.600
<v Speaker 1>whatever you want to call it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

1144
00:56:15.750 --> 00:56:19.140
<v Speaker 1>however you're taking it in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the perception that you get about people</v>

1145
00:56:19.290 --> 00:56:22.860
<v Speaker 1>like the friendlier in the kinder and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the nicer you put out,</v>

1146
00:56:23.110 --> 00:56:24.070
<v Speaker 1>the more you're going to run</v>

1147
00:56:24.070 --> 00:56:26.230
<v Speaker 6>into people that respect and respond to </v>
<v Speaker 6>you that way.</v>

1148
00:56:26.260 --> 00:56:31.260
<v Speaker 6>That's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Think about the way you respond to some </v>

1149
00:56:31.260 --> 00:56:31.260
<v Speaker 6>people like you have some people in your</v>
<v Speaker 6>life.</v>

1150
00:56:31.260 --> 00:56:32.980
<v Speaker 6>You know that you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>any one person,</v>

1151
00:56:32.981 --> 00:56:35.440
<v Speaker 6>pick them that you love to see.</v>
<v Speaker 6>When you see him,</v>

1152
00:56:35.441 --> 00:56:40.441
<v Speaker 6>you have this big great because you know</v>
<v Speaker 6>that he's going to always going to be </v>

1153
00:56:40.441 --> 00:56:43.201
<v Speaker 6>really cool with you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're always going to be really cool </v>

1154
00:56:43.201 --> 00:56:43.201
<v Speaker 6>with him.</v>
<v Speaker 6>When you meet each other,</v>

1155
00:56:43.201 --> 00:56:43.630
<v Speaker 6>it's all gravy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's all like super,</v>

1156
00:56:43.631 --> 00:56:45.730
<v Speaker 6>super powerful happiness.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Now,</v>

1157
00:56:46.060 --> 00:56:48.670
<v Speaker 6>when you know that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like if you're with that person,</v>

1158
00:56:48.671 --> 00:56:50.290
<v Speaker 6>if you're with a group of people that </v>
<v Speaker 6>are really,</v>

1159
00:56:50.320 --> 00:56:54.100
<v Speaker 6>really close friends like that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you have this like no fear,</v>

1160
00:56:54.130 --> 00:56:58.300
<v Speaker 6>great feeling bond going right,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but you don't have that with people that</v>

1161
00:56:58.301 --> 00:57:00.250
<v Speaker 6>are strangers.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You don't have that with the rest of the</v>

1162
00:57:00.251 --> 00:57:01.510
<v Speaker 6>universe,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it is possible.</v>

1163
00:57:01.510 --> 00:57:04.480
<v Speaker 6>So it is possible to achieve with a </v>
<v Speaker 6>small group of people.</v>

1164
00:57:04.481 --> 00:57:07.630
<v Speaker 6>If you come to an understanding and </v>
<v Speaker 6>you're both completely cool about shit,</v>

1165
00:57:07.790 --> 00:57:12.790
<v Speaker 6>you're both completely honest about shit</v>
<v Speaker 6>and you both go through this life like </v>

1166
00:57:12.790 --> 00:57:17.581
<v Speaker 6>you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is the attitude is not all about </v>

1167
00:57:17.581 --> 00:57:17.581
<v Speaker 6>me.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's all about all of us.</v>

1168
00:57:17.581 --> 00:57:20.971
<v Speaker 6>It's all about everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's all about doing the most positive </v>

1169
00:57:20.971 --> 00:57:24.031
<v Speaker 6>that you can into spreading the most </v>
<v Speaker 6>good vibes that you can and putting out </v>

1170
00:57:24.031 --> 00:57:24.340
<v Speaker 6>the most fun that you possibly can.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

1171
00:57:24.341 --> 00:57:29.341
<v Speaker 6>if you can possibly do that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This we're not talking about putting a </v>

1172
00:57:29.341 --> 00:57:30.520
<v Speaker 6>robot on Mars like this is all shit that</v>
<v Speaker 6>I could figure it out.</v>

1173
00:57:30.521 --> 00:57:32.330
<v Speaker 6>This is all shit that you can figure </v>
<v Speaker 6>this out.</v>

1174
00:57:32.360 --> 00:57:32.920
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is.</v>

1175
00:57:33.040 --> 00:57:35.350
<v Speaker 6>This is stuff that wouldn't be that </v>
<v Speaker 6>hard.</v>

1176
00:57:35.530 --> 00:57:37.450
<v Speaker 6>If you're not in jail and you're not a </v>
<v Speaker 6>murderer,</v>

1177
00:57:37.550 --> 00:57:38.990
<v Speaker 6>a rapist,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you delegate.</v>

1178
00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:44.000
<v Speaker 6>Total complete piece of shit would not </v>
<v Speaker 6>be that hard to turn your life around </v>

1179
00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:45.900
<v Speaker 6>and get yourself to a point where </v>
<v Speaker 6>you're.</v>

1180
00:57:45.930 --> 00:57:47.890
<v Speaker 6>You're not shitty to people.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's right.</v>

1181
00:57:48.010 --> 00:57:51.700
<v Speaker 6>That's not hard to imagine that people,</v>
<v Speaker 6>even people that have been involved with</v>

1182
00:57:51.910 --> 00:57:54.790
<v Speaker 6>petty crime or forgery or whatever the </v>
<v Speaker 6>fuck it is,</v>

1183
00:57:54.791 --> 00:57:59.791
<v Speaker 6>just if they just stopped doing all that</v>
<v Speaker 6>and started treating all the people </v>

1184
00:57:59.791 --> 00:58:02.350
<v Speaker 6>around them as if it was them living </v>
<v Speaker 6>another life.</v>

1185
00:58:02.890 --> 00:58:07.890
<v Speaker 6>That's not that hard to imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's only hard to imagine if everyone's </v>

1186
00:58:07.890 --> 00:58:10.390
<v Speaker 6>like clawing and scratching and trying </v>
<v Speaker 6>to make it to where end,</v>

1187
00:58:10.870 --> 00:58:14.680
<v Speaker 6>dealing with the effects of a shitty </v>
<v Speaker 6>childhood,</v>

1188
00:58:14.890 --> 00:58:18.670
<v Speaker 6>which is Goddamn almost everything for </v>
<v Speaker 6>most people.</v>

1189
00:58:18.671 --> 00:58:23.671
<v Speaker 6>It's the number one trip up mind fuck </v>
<v Speaker 6>programming gone badly from the </v>

1190
00:58:24.851 --> 00:58:27.460
<v Speaker 6>beginning and it's so hard to erase the </v>
<v Speaker 6>hard drive,</v>

1191
00:58:27.461 --> 00:58:31.060
<v Speaker 6>reformat the discs and do it correctly.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So fucking hard.</v>

1192
00:58:31.090 --> 00:58:31.440
<v Speaker 6>Dude.</v>

1193
00:58:32.470 --> 00:58:37.120
<v Speaker 3>This is why we have therapy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1194
00:58:37.180 --> 00:58:40.510
<v Speaker 3>That's the like you can like their.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is why people go to therapy because</v>

1195
00:58:40.511 --> 00:58:44.440
<v Speaker 3>those guys are really good at getting </v>
<v Speaker 3>you to swim down into your childhood and</v>

1196
00:58:44.441 --> 00:58:46.660
<v Speaker 3>find the place where you got the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1197
00:58:47.110 --> 00:58:52.110
<v Speaker 3>you generally you're going to get one of</v>
<v Speaker 3>two teachings.</v>

1198
00:58:52.270 --> 00:58:54.160
<v Speaker 3>You're going to a few different </v>
<v Speaker 3>teachings from growing up,</v>

1199
00:58:54.161 --> 00:58:59.161
<v Speaker 3>but one of the teachings a lot of people</v>
<v Speaker 3>get is that there's not enough milk in </v>

1200
00:58:59.561 --> 00:59:04.561
<v Speaker 3>the netball.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They get some version of that which is </v>

1201
00:59:04.561 --> 00:59:04.600
<v Speaker 3>like the food's going to run out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The loves getting run out.</v>

1202
00:59:04.630 --> 00:59:05.350
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1203
00:59:05.351 --> 00:59:09.430
<v Speaker 3>this is not a safe environment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your mom and I are working really hard,</v>

1204
00:59:09.431 --> 00:59:12.400
<v Speaker 3>but we don't have enough money and we </v>
<v Speaker 3>can't make ends meet and sometimes we're</v>

1205
00:59:12.401 --> 00:59:17.401
<v Speaker 3>not gonna have enough and I can't afford</v>
<v Speaker 3>to get you the stuff the other kids get </v>

1206
00:59:17.401 --> 00:59:18.820
<v Speaker 3>and I'll tell you why because my boss,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mr.</v>

1207
00:59:18.940 --> 00:59:21.270
<v Speaker 3>what was the name you gave that guy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Start what?</v>

1208
00:59:21.500 --> 00:59:22.070
<v Speaker 3>My boss.</v>

1209
00:59:22.070 --> 00:59:25.220
<v Speaker 7>Mr Whitmore is a fucking asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1210
00:59:25.221 --> 00:59:30.221
<v Speaker 7>Whitmore sort of a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 7>She's given me too many hours and he's </v>

1211
00:59:30.221 --> 00:59:30.770
<v Speaker 7>not giving me a fucking raise and so </v>
<v Speaker 7>life sucks.</v>

1212
00:59:30.771 --> 00:59:32.630
<v Speaker 7>Do you understand it?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Shut up and look at me.</v>

1213
00:59:32.631 --> 00:59:35.360
<v Speaker 7>You Little Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Have you been smoking fucking weed?</v>

1214
00:59:35.510 --> 00:59:38.030
<v Speaker 7>Do you not understand how dangerous this</v>
<v Speaker 7>world is?</v>

1215
00:59:38.240 --> 00:59:40.580
<v Speaker 7>A lot of people get that and they come </v>
<v Speaker 7>out of their,</v>

1216
00:59:40.700 --> 00:59:43.880
<v Speaker 7>their family life,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like somebody you just got flown in from</v>

1217
00:59:43.881 --> 00:59:47.060
<v Speaker 7>fucking Afghanistan.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They have a kind of PTSD.</v>

1218
00:59:47.240 --> 00:59:48.900
<v Speaker 7>They don't understand what,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

1219
00:59:49.460 --> 00:59:54.460
<v Speaker 7>they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They don't understand that the universe </v>

1220
00:59:54.460 --> 00:59:54.830
<v Speaker 7>is ambivalent.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's not malicious.</v>

1221
00:59:54.831 --> 00:59:57.380
<v Speaker 7>It's ambivalent.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's the best.</v>

1222
00:59:57.381 --> 00:59:59.790
<v Speaker 7>It's ambivalent.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And if it's low,</v>

1223
01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:03.230
<v Speaker 7>if the universe is the universe has some</v>
<v Speaker 7>agenda,</v>

1224
01:00:03.231 --> 01:00:05.030
<v Speaker 7>will fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Let's just give up.</v>

1225
01:00:05.060 --> 01:00:10.060
<v Speaker 7>There's no free will.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But if the universe is just to kind of </v>

1226
01:00:10.060 --> 01:00:11.870
<v Speaker 7>chamber within,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which we can experiment with manifesting</v>

1227
01:00:11.871 --> 01:00:16.871
<v Speaker 7>whatever our goals happen to be,</v>
<v Speaker 7>then it's not that the universe is out </v>

1228
01:00:16.871 --> 01:00:17.420
<v Speaker 7>to get you no matter where you're at.</v>

1229
01:00:17.770 --> 01:00:22.770
<v Speaker 7>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 7>your conceptualization of the universe </v>

1230
01:00:22.770 --> 01:00:25.211
<v Speaker 7>is a thing out to get you is only </v>
<v Speaker 7>reaffirming that awful version of the </v>

1231
01:00:26.451 --> 01:00:31.451
<v Speaker 7>universe that got crystallized in your </v>
<v Speaker 7>head a way back when and now you're </v>

1232
01:00:31.451 --> 01:00:33.230
<v Speaker 7>always trying to be right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's another thing.</v>

1233
01:00:33.231 --> 01:00:37.010
<v Speaker 7>People in rough families,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they're always trying to be right.</v>

1234
01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:39.200
<v Speaker 7>They want to be fucking write about </v>
<v Speaker 7>everything.</v>

1235
01:00:39.380 --> 01:00:44.380
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they want to assert their will be right </v>

1236
01:00:44.380 --> 01:00:47.500
<v Speaker 7>in there and because there are a war </v>
<v Speaker 7>because they feel like if they're not </v>

1237
01:00:47.500 --> 01:00:47.500
<v Speaker 7>right,</v>
<v Speaker 7>then they're vulnerable.</v>

1238
01:00:47.500 --> 01:00:49.730
<v Speaker 7>So the next time,</v>
<v Speaker 7>here's a fun fucking experiment.</v>

1239
01:00:49.731 --> 01:00:53.480
<v Speaker 7>I know you already do this man,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but I've been try playing around with it</v>

1240
01:00:53.810 --> 01:00:55.670
<v Speaker 7>the next time someone does something </v>
<v Speaker 7>wrong to you,</v>

1241
01:00:56.420 --> 01:01:01.420
<v Speaker 7>really wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like someone does something wrong to </v>

1242
01:01:01.420 --> 01:01:03.971
<v Speaker 7>you.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The thing that you're always fighting </v>

1243
01:01:03.971 --> 01:01:06.191
<v Speaker 7>back against and always being right when</v>
<v Speaker 7>you the next time you've been wronged </v>

1244
01:01:06.850 --> 01:01:11.850
<v Speaker 7>for real,</v>
<v Speaker 7>where you could easily say to the </v>

1245
01:01:11.850 --> 01:01:11.960
<v Speaker 7>person,</v>
<v Speaker 7>this is fucked up what you did to me and</v>

1246
01:01:11.961 --> 01:01:12.680
<v Speaker 7>here's why.</v>

1247
01:01:13.220 --> 01:01:18.220
<v Speaker 7>Let them be right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Just play around with losing and not </v>

1248
01:01:18.220 --> 01:01:19.970
<v Speaker 7>even though you know that you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 7>play around not being right.</v>

1249

<v Speaker 7>Surrender.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Watch what happens.</v>

1250
01:01:22.250 --> 01:01:24.650
<v Speaker 7>Just love them,</v>
<v Speaker 7>love them and be wrong.</v>

1251
01:01:24.890 --> 01:01:26.750
<v Speaker 7>Let them think they're right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Love them.</v>

1252
01:01:26.751 --> 01:01:28.910
<v Speaker 7>Let let them work through whatever it is</v>
<v Speaker 7>they're working through.</v>

1253
01:01:29.060 --> 01:01:30.890
<v Speaker 7>Watch what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's the weirdest,</v>

<v Speaker 7>I'm going to get you one.</v>

1259
01:01:40.851 --> 01:01:41.780
<v Speaker 7>I'm going to get you.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You did it.</v>

1260
01:01:41.781 --> 01:01:42.830
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I got you.</v>

1261
01:01:44.040 --> 01:01:44.840
<v Speaker 7>I got you.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Good.</v>

1262
01:01:45.110 --> 01:01:48.980
<v Speaker 7>Stopped taking revenge.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The next time you get a chance.</v>

1263
01:01:49.010 --> 01:01:51.440
<v Speaker 7>Be merciful even though the person </v>
<v Speaker 7>deserves it.</v>

1264
01:01:51.680 --> 01:01:53.930
<v Speaker 7>Just be merciful.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's a really fun experiment.</v>

1265
01:01:54.200 --> 01:01:59.200
<v Speaker 7>It's really fun and you'll like the </v>
<v Speaker 7>weight that gets lifted off of you in </v>

1266
01:01:59.200 --> 01:01:59.200
<v Speaker 7>that moment.</v>

1267
01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:04.280
<v Speaker 7>I,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I stopped drinking recently and I was </v>

1268
01:02:04.280 --> 01:02:05.450
<v Speaker 7>drinking too much man.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I was drinking like every night,</v>

1269
01:02:05.451 --> 01:02:08.090
<v Speaker 7>a couple of beers and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>

1270
01:02:08.091 --> 01:02:09.650
<v Speaker 7>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Did it creep up on you?</v>

1271
01:02:10.250 --> 01:02:12.920
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Creeped up and I realized know I started</v>

1272
01:02:12.921 --> 01:02:17.840
<v Speaker 7>training with Justin and a quick things </v>
<v Speaker 7>creep up on you though.</v>

1273
01:02:18.200 --> 01:02:19.070
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they creep up.</v>

1274
01:02:19.230 --> 01:02:20.790
<v Speaker 7>You've had a couple of things creep up </v>
<v Speaker 7>on you.</v>

1275
01:02:20.791 --> 01:02:24.540
<v Speaker 7>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well that's the alcohol like creeped and</v>

1276
01:02:24.541 --> 01:02:29.541
<v Speaker 7>all of a sudden I was drinking every </v>
<v Speaker 7>night and I was kinda getting used to </v>

1277
01:02:29.541 --> 01:02:30.270
<v Speaker 7>the idea of waking up with a hangover </v>
<v Speaker 7>and like it was bad.</v>

1278
01:02:30.570 --> 01:02:32.250
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so I told me like,</v>

1279
01:02:32.251 --> 01:02:35.520
<v Speaker 7>you can't have certain pills around or </v>
<v Speaker 7>you'll just keep eating.</v>

1280
01:02:35.970 --> 01:02:37.180
<v Speaker 7>That's my problem.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's,</v>

1281
01:02:37.260 --> 01:02:42.260
<v Speaker 7>that's actually a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And it's a blessing because like if I </v>

1282
01:02:42.260 --> 01:02:42.770
<v Speaker 7>get addicted to something healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I get really addicted to.</v>

1283
01:02:43.340 --> 01:02:48.340
<v Speaker 7>The problem is it's easier to get </v>
<v Speaker 7>addicted to things that aren't healthy </v>

1284
01:02:48.340 --> 01:02:48.340
<v Speaker 7>for you.</v>

1285
01:02:48.340 --> 01:02:48.660
<v Speaker 7>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>yeah man,</v>

1286
01:02:48.661 --> 01:02:50.070
<v Speaker 7>I realized like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1287
01:02:50.071 --> 01:02:53.320
<v Speaker 7>I wasn't like Charles Zbikowski,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I wasn't even drinking vodka.</v>

1288
01:02:53.321 --> 01:02:58.321
<v Speaker 7>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it was just a very subtle thing I was </v>

1289
01:02:58.321 --> 01:02:58.470
<v Speaker 7>doing where every night I'd have two </v>
<v Speaker 7>beers,</v>

1290
01:02:58.920 --> 01:03:03.920
<v Speaker 7>maybe three beers,</v>
<v Speaker 7>sometimes it wasn't like I was getting </v>

1291
01:03:03.920 --> 01:03:06.711
<v Speaker 7>hammered,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but every night I was putting alcohol </v>

1292
01:03:06.711 --> 01:03:06.711
<v Speaker 7>into my bloodstream with great </v>
<v Speaker 7>frequency.</v>

1293
01:03:06.711 --> 01:03:07.320
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And so,</v>

1294
01:03:07.890 --> 01:03:08.280
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I,</v>

1295
01:03:08.550 --> 01:03:13.550
<v Speaker 7>I've been thinking a lot about the </v>
<v Speaker 7>concept of the human life as being kind </v>

1296
01:03:15.661 --> 01:03:20.661
<v Speaker 7>of out chemical experiment.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like your body is like a beaker and </v>

1297
01:03:20.670 --> 01:03:25.670
<v Speaker 7>everything that you eat and everything </v>
<v Speaker 7>that you witnessed and everything that </v>

1298
01:03:25.670 --> 01:03:28.731
<v Speaker 7>you hear,</v>
<v Speaker 7>whatever enters into your sensory input </v>

1299
01:03:28.731 --> 01:03:31.761
<v Speaker 7>is like an additive that you're in.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You're putting into this mix and the mix</v>

1300
01:03:31.981 --> 01:03:35.760
<v Speaker 7>that you're creating is.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It depends on what you want to create,</v>

1301
01:03:35.761 --> 01:03:39.660
<v Speaker 7>but what you definitely don't want to </v>
<v Speaker 7>create in that mix is sadness,</v>

1302
01:03:39.720 --> 01:03:40.770
<v Speaker 7>horror,</v>
<v Speaker 7>depression,</v>

1303
01:03:40.771 --> 01:03:41.880
<v Speaker 7>anger,</v>
<v Speaker 7>bitterness,</v>

1304
01:03:41.881 --> 01:03:42.570
<v Speaker 7>loneliness.</v>

1305
01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:45.450
<v Speaker 7>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'd like that mix to be health,</v>

1306
01:03:45.780 --> 01:03:49.020
<v Speaker 7>happiness,</v>
<v Speaker 7>amplification of my ability to love,</v>

1307
01:03:49.021 --> 01:03:50.580
<v Speaker 7>forgiveness,</v>
<v Speaker 7>all that kind of stuff.</v>

1308
01:03:50.581 --> 01:03:55.581
<v Speaker 7>So from that Pov,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I was noticing that when I was drinking </v>

1309
01:03:55.920 --> 01:03:59.580
<v Speaker 7>my ability,</v>
<v Speaker 7>my ego is flaring up a little bit.</v>

1310
01:03:59.581 --> 01:04:01.730
<v Speaker 7>I found myself,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

1311
01:04:02.250 --> 01:04:06.090
<v Speaker 7>just kind of in a,</v>
<v Speaker 7>in what if I continued that path,</v>

1312
01:04:06.540 --> 01:04:11.540
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if I kept drinking and drinking and </v>

1313
01:04:11.540 --> 01:04:13.371
<v Speaker 7>drinking and drinking,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I could just see where it would take me </v>

1314
01:04:13.371 --> 01:04:15.120
<v Speaker 7>a and I didn't want to go there.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So anyway,</v>

1315
01:04:15.121 --> 01:04:18.630
<v Speaker 7>I stopped drinking and started doing </v>
<v Speaker 7>this kind of like observation of the way</v>

1316
01:04:18.631 --> 01:04:20.760
<v Speaker 7>I feel now that I'm not drinking.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

1317
01:04:21.420 --> 01:04:25.490
<v Speaker 7>And one thing I've noticed is that when </v>
<v Speaker 7>I go out to a club or a bar where are,</v>

1318
01:04:25.510 --> 01:04:30.510
<v Speaker 7>wherever there's alcohol and I don't </v>
<v Speaker 7>drink about like 10:00</v>

1319
01:04:31.711 --> 01:04:34.890
<v Speaker 7>or 11:00,</v>
<v Speaker 7>my body feels so good.</v>

1320
01:04:35.160 --> 01:04:36.510
<v Speaker 7>Like all of a sudden my body is like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>wait,</v>

1321
01:04:36.511 --> 01:04:37.650
<v Speaker 7>why do we feel so good?</v>

1322
01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:39.300
<v Speaker 7>What the fuck is going on?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Man?</v>

1323
01:04:39.301 --> 01:04:41.310
<v Speaker 7>I feel this.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I feel really good.</v>

1324
01:04:41.311 --> 01:04:42.990
<v Speaker 7>And I think that like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>why do I feel so good?</v>

1325
01:04:42.991 --> 01:04:43.710
<v Speaker 7>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>oh,</v>

1326
01:04:44.190 --> 01:04:46.110
<v Speaker 7>you don't have two beers in your fucking</v>
<v Speaker 7>system.</v>

1327
01:04:46.111 --> 01:04:51.111
<v Speaker 7>Your blood sugar's not thrown off.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You don't have like this like flammable </v>

1328
01:04:51.111 --> 01:04:54.801
<v Speaker 7>liquid coursing through your body.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's considered to be one of the most </v>

1329
01:04:54.801 --> 01:04:56.490
<v Speaker 7>dangerous drugs that currently exists on</v>
<v Speaker 7>the planet that we're on.</v>

1330
01:04:56.880 --> 01:04:58.650
<v Speaker 7>And I feel awesome in the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 7>you wake up,</v>
<v Speaker 7>my God damn man.</v>

<v Speaker 7>Weird.</v>

<v Speaker 7>liquid in your stomach being.</v>

<v Speaker 7>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like,</v>

1335

<v Speaker 7>fibers of the fermented wheat juices </v>

<v Speaker 7>these things as an experiment don't </v>
<v Speaker 7>take.</v>

1357
01:06:07.010 --> 01:06:08.530
<v Speaker 7>You don't have to get all heavy about </v>

<v Speaker 7>I'm going to watch what I'm like when I </v>
<v Speaker 7>drink.</v>

1360
01:06:11.890 --> 01:06:13.720
<v Speaker 7>I'm going to watch what I like when I </v>
<v Speaker 7>don't drink.</v>

1361
01:06:13.930 --> 01:06:15.520
<v Speaker 7>I'm going to pick which one I liked </v>

<v Speaker 7>forgive my rant.</v>

1365
01:06:25.240 --> 01:06:30.240
<v Speaker 7>What I noticed is if I get my,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that I have an addiction to being right,</v>

1366
01:06:30.820 --> 01:06:32.800
<v Speaker 7>that I have an addiction to getting </v>
<v Speaker 7>revenge,</v>

1367
01:06:32.801 --> 01:06:36.430
<v Speaker 7>that I have an addiction to making sure </v>
<v Speaker 7>that like,</v>

1368
01:06:36.490 --> 01:06:37.120
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

1370
01:06:42.121 --> 01:06:42.121
<v Speaker 7>fucking thing is.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Not In an extreme way,</v>

1371
01:06:42.121 --> 01:06:42.121
<v Speaker 7>but like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1372
01:06:42.121 --> 01:06:44.050
<v Speaker 7>if I feel like I've been wronged,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm going to let you know.</v>

1373
01:06:44.051 --> 01:06:45.310
<v Speaker 7>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm going to let you know.</v>

1374
01:06:45.311 --> 01:06:47.440
<v Speaker 7>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so if instead of doing that,</v>

1375
01:06:47.441 --> 01:06:52.441
<v Speaker 7>I stopped that game.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I've stopped that game whenever I </v>

1376
01:06:52.441 --> 01:06:52.870
<v Speaker 7>stopped that game.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Wow.</v>

1377
01:06:52.930 --> 01:06:57.930
<v Speaker 7>It's exactly like when I'm not drinking </v>
<v Speaker 7>like where there normally is a fight </v>

1378
01:06:57.930 --> 01:07:00.670
<v Speaker 7>where there's normally some bit of </v>
<v Speaker 7>awkwardness or uncomfortableness or just</v>

1379
01:07:00.671 --> 01:07:04.660
<v Speaker 7>a general diminishing a experience of </v>
<v Speaker 7>the universe.</v>

1380
01:07:04.660 --> 01:07:06.340
<v Speaker 7>There's this.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh Wow.</v>

1381
01:07:06.400 --> 01:07:09.010
<v Speaker 7>I don't have to punish.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You don't have to get you back.</v>

1382
01:07:09.220 --> 01:07:11.770
<v Speaker 7>I don't have to get revenge.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't have to say anything.</v>

1383
01:07:11.771 --> 01:07:16.771
<v Speaker 7>I can just sit here and love you and </v>
<v Speaker 7>this moment will pass and everything </v>

1384
01:07:16.771 --> 01:07:18.850
<v Speaker 7>continues to be cool.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The universe doesn't fall apart.</v>

1385
01:07:19.090 --> 01:07:23.620
<v Speaker 7>My belly doesn't get ripped open by the </v>
<v Speaker 7>clause of my enemy.</v>

1386
01:07:23.770 --> 01:07:27.310
<v Speaker 7>I don't have to get revenge.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't have to become like the beast of</v>

1387
01:07:27.311 --> 01:07:32.311
<v Speaker 7>the field and tear everything apart.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I can actually just love things and in </v>

1388
01:07:32.311 --> 01:07:37.081
<v Speaker 7>general,</v>
<v Speaker 7>loving them is going to do a hell of a </v>

1389
01:07:37.081 --> 01:07:39.511
<v Speaker 7>lot more for transforming them into </v>
<v Speaker 7>something a kinder than me telling them </v>

1390
01:07:40.361 --> 01:07:40.900
<v Speaker 7>they suck.</v>

1391
01:07:41.570 --> 01:07:46.570
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there are definitely exceptions to this </v>

1392
01:07:46.570 --> 01:07:46.570
<v Speaker 5>rule,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but for the most part,</v>

1393
01:07:46.850 --> 01:07:49.490
<v Speaker 5>most exchanges that people have with </v>
<v Speaker 5>each other,</v>

1394
01:07:50.080 --> 01:07:54.380
<v Speaker 5>our our exchanges is two people giving </v>
<v Speaker 5>out two different personalities,</v>

1395
01:07:54.410 --> 01:07:59.410
<v Speaker 5>exchanging expression.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The way they talk to each other is </v>

1396
01:07:59.410 --> 01:08:03.371
<v Speaker 5>dependent upon the way the other person </v>
<v Speaker 5>reacts and it's the volatile </v>

1397
01:08:03.371 --> 01:08:05.690
<v Speaker 5>combinations are oftentimes more than </v>
<v Speaker 5>one person's fault.</v>

1398
01:08:06.050 --> 01:08:11.050
<v Speaker 5>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's not a lot of people have to be </v>

1399
01:08:11.050 --> 01:08:11.900
<v Speaker 5>on board with this for it to really </v>
<v Speaker 5>work,</v>

1400
01:08:11.930 --> 01:08:14.870
<v Speaker 5>but it's absolutely possible that it can</v>
<v Speaker 5>work.</v>

1401
01:08:15.560 --> 01:08:16.010
<v Speaker 5>The idea</v>

1402
01:08:16.010 --> 01:08:18.620
<v Speaker 6>that we're supposed to be constantly in </v>
<v Speaker 6>conflict with each other.</v>

1403
01:08:18.621 --> 01:08:23.621
<v Speaker 6>Like I can't tell you how many people </v>
<v Speaker 6>that I know that are in relationships </v>

1404
01:08:23.621 --> 01:08:25.390
<v Speaker 6>that accept yelling and throwing shit at</v>
<v Speaker 6>each other.</v>

1405
01:08:25.860 --> 01:08:30.860
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>can you imagine if you had a buddy and </v>

1406
01:08:30.860 --> 01:08:30.860
<v Speaker 6>he just yelled at you all the time and </v>
<v Speaker 6>threw shit at you.</v>

1407
01:08:30.860 --> 01:08:30.920
<v Speaker 6>You'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>dude,</v>

1408
01:08:31.220 --> 01:08:36.220
<v Speaker 6>what the fuck man,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you gotTa stop yelling at me and </v>

1409
01:08:36.220 --> 01:08:36.220
<v Speaker 6>throwing shit at me.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Put your fist up.</v>

1410
01:08:36.220 --> 01:08:37.520
<v Speaker 6>You're going to hit me like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't want to be around you.</v>

1411
01:08:37.521 --> 01:08:38.470
<v Speaker 6>I don't do that to you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>

1412
01:08:38.480 --> 01:08:43.480
<v Speaker 6>this is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's this got to be some sort of a </v>

1413
01:08:43.821 --> 01:08:48.821
<v Speaker 6>fundamental change in how people look at</v>
<v Speaker 6>each other and until,</v>

1414
01:08:49.310 --> 01:08:54.310
<v Speaker 6>until that happens,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we're still going to get tricked by </v>

1415
01:08:54.310 --> 01:08:55.640
<v Speaker 6>being from a certain,</v>
<v Speaker 6>being proud of being from a certain city</v>

1416
01:08:56.030 --> 01:09:01.030
<v Speaker 6>or being proud of being from a certain </v>
<v Speaker 6>state and then in competition with the </v>

1417
01:09:01.030 --> 01:09:02.750
<v Speaker 6>other states in competition with the </v>
<v Speaker 6>other cities and the other countries,</v>

1418
01:09:02.751 --> 01:09:04.820
<v Speaker 6>they could suck it because look at Toby </v>
<v Speaker 6>Keith said,</v>

1419
01:09:04.821 --> 01:09:06.070
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>run,</v>

1420
01:09:07.520 --> 01:09:08.960
<v Speaker 6>you know all that nonsense.</v>

1421
01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:11.330
<v Speaker 6>It's all whole,</v>
<v Speaker 6>all of it.</v>

1422
01:09:11.380 --> 01:09:13.550
<v Speaker 6>This is just,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's just people,</v>

1423
01:09:13.551 --> 01:09:14.540
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1424
01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:16.430
<v Speaker 6>like I'm not necessarily on a team with </v>
<v Speaker 6>you.</v>

1425
01:09:16.790 --> 01:09:21.790
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we're all trapped in this one continent </v>

1426
01:09:21.790 --> 01:09:21.790
<v Speaker 6>together and we should be cool with each</v>
<v Speaker 6>other and we should,</v>

1427
01:09:21.790 --> 01:09:24.710
<v Speaker 6>but we should be on team world.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Is America the shit?</v>

1428
01:09:24.740 --> 01:09:29.740
<v Speaker 6>Of course it is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a great place for anybody who says </v>

1429
01:09:29.740 --> 01:09:31.430
<v Speaker 6>America is not an amazing spot for a lot</v>
<v Speaker 6>of different shit is out of their mind.</v>

1430
01:09:31.431 --> 01:09:36.431
<v Speaker 6>You have to be a hater.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You have to be a hater to not look at </v>

1431
01:09:36.431 --> 01:09:38.801
<v Speaker 6>the insane amount of accomplishments </v>
<v Speaker 6>that have come out of this spot that </v>

1432
01:09:38.801 --> 01:09:39.800
<v Speaker 6>have nothing to do with you or I have </v>
<v Speaker 6>nothing to do with us.</v>

1433
01:09:39.830 --> 01:09:42.380
<v Speaker 6>Just completely objectively.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We didn't even exist.</v>

1434
01:09:42.381 --> 01:09:45.980
<v Speaker 6>We were just a computer analyzing be </v>
<v Speaker 6>human life on this planet.</v>

1435
01:09:45.981 --> 01:09:49.520
<v Speaker 6>You would have to say the United States </v>
<v Speaker 6>is to shit on because if you weren't,</v>

1436
01:09:49.521 --> 01:09:50.180
<v Speaker 6>you'd be lying.</v>

1437
01:09:50.360 --> 01:09:52.670
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But the idea that somehow or another,</v>

1438
01:09:52.671 --> 01:09:54.960
<v Speaker 6>the United States is important and that </v>
<v Speaker 6>Africa is in,</v>

1439
01:09:55.050 --> 01:09:56.680
<v Speaker 6>is important in Antarctica is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>

1440
01:09:56.681 --> 01:09:58.010
<v Speaker 6>and this is important,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but that isn't,</v>

1441
01:09:58.090 --> 01:10:00.350
<v Speaker 6>and this is more important than that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And these people have our land.</v>

1442
01:10:00.351 --> 01:10:01.480
<v Speaker 6>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>whoa,</v>

1443
01:10:01.481 --> 01:10:02.600
<v Speaker 6>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 6>whoa.</v>

1444
01:10:02.630 --> 01:10:04.760
<v Speaker 6>Who is we?</v>
<v Speaker 6>And they and our,</v>

1445
01:10:05.030 --> 01:10:10.030
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's a human beings interacting with </v>

1446
01:10:10.030 --> 01:10:10.030
<v Speaker 6>each other.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What are you saying?</v>

1447
01:10:10.030 --> 01:10:10.030
<v Speaker 6>They can't live here and you can't live </v>
<v Speaker 6>there.</v>

1448
01:10:10.030 --> 01:10:12.980
<v Speaker 6>And what fucking government owned what </v>
<v Speaker 6>patch of dirt?</v>

1449
01:10:12.981 --> 01:10:17.150
<v Speaker 6>And they get to instill Sharia law.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What the fuck are you doing?</v>

1450
01:10:17.690 --> 01:10:22.690
<v Speaker 6>God Damn that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The problem is the organization of all </v>

1451
01:10:22.690 --> 01:10:24.830
<v Speaker 6>these different human beings under </v>
<v Speaker 6>various groups,</v>

1452
01:10:24.831 --> 01:10:26.780
<v Speaker 6>whether it's the group called the city </v>
<v Speaker 6>of the group,</v>

1453
01:10:26.781 --> 01:10:28.880
<v Speaker 6>call it state of the group called a </v>
<v Speaker 6>country.</v>

1454
01:10:29.160 --> 01:10:33.440
<v Speaker 6>That's where shit gets fucked and then </v>
<v Speaker 6>you rely on the morals and the intellect</v>

1455
01:10:33.441 --> 01:10:38.441
<v Speaker 6>of a handful of leaders to guide the </v>
<v Speaker 6>entire fucking set of laws that govern </v>

1456
01:10:40.430 --> 01:10:41.780
<v Speaker 6>this patch of land.</v>

1457
01:10:42.250 --> 01:10:47.250
<v Speaker 6>Millions and millions of people tend to </v>
<v Speaker 6>either we let the terminator be the </v>

1458
01:10:47.250 --> 01:10:51.311
<v Speaker 6>governor of California.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That should be enough to and he didn't </v>

1459
01:10:51.311 --> 01:10:51.500
<v Speaker 6>do a bad job.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Not Bad at all to do a bad job.</v>

1460
01:10:51.860 --> 01:10:53.420
<v Speaker 6>He did a lot better job than other </v>
<v Speaker 6>folks,</v>

1461
01:10:53.460 --> 01:10:56.210
<v Speaker 6>whether I'm not dissatisfied with a </v>
<v Speaker 6>terminator.</v>

1462
01:10:56.900 --> 01:10:59.500
<v Speaker 6>He was a good governor.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The La River in particular,</v>

1463
01:10:59.501 --> 01:11:03.020
<v Speaker 6>you did some good stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean he daddy's got assigned by the La</v>

1464
01:11:03.020 --> 01:11:08.020
<v Speaker 6>River,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so I guess that means you did something </v>

1465
01:11:08.020 --> 01:11:08.020
<v Speaker 6>to it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The way he describes it,</v>

1466
01:11:08.020 --> 01:11:10.991
<v Speaker 6>he says like the bureaucracy of </v>
<v Speaker 6>government was just insanely </v>

1467
01:11:10.991 --> 01:11:11.600
<v Speaker 6>complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like there's no way to get through it.</v>

1468
01:11:11.890 --> 01:11:13.920
<v Speaker 6>It's like the way they had.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They would say,</v>

1469
01:11:14.250 --> 01:11:15.660
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that would be logical,</v>

1470
01:11:15.661 --> 01:11:18.090
<v Speaker 4>but we can't do it that way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so if you bring this up,</v>

1471
01:11:18.120 --> 01:11:23.120
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to oppose it because it </v>
<v Speaker 4>benefits my constituents that I oppose </v>

1472
01:11:23.120 --> 01:11:25.340
<v Speaker 4>it and then we'll debate and it'll just </v>
<v Speaker 4>get pushed under the rug and go away and</v>

1473
01:11:25.350 --> 01:11:27.630
<v Speaker 4>that's how we do it and they squash </v>
<v Speaker 4>things that way and they.</v>

1474
01:11:27.790 --> 01:11:30.390
<v Speaker 4>And so this is a handful of people that </v>
<v Speaker 4>are,</v>

1475
01:11:30.420 --> 01:11:35.420
<v Speaker 4>that are moving around all these core </v>
<v Speaker 4>parts of our society and changing weird </v>

1476
01:11:36.451 --> 01:11:41.451
<v Speaker 4>laws and instilling new regulations and </v>
<v Speaker 4>charging taxes and figuring out all this</v>

1477
01:11:41.761 --> 01:11:43.040
<v Speaker 4>weird shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

1478
01:11:43.230 --> 01:11:45.450
<v Speaker 4>and this is a fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are there hundred of them?</v>

1479
01:11:45.451 --> 01:11:46.860
<v Speaker 4>A few hundred of them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy.</v>

1480
01:11:47.130 --> 01:11:52.130
<v Speaker 4>The idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A few hundred people could say it's a </v>

1481
01:11:52.130 --> 01:11:53.400
<v Speaker 4>thousand a thousand people at the top of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the heap in California.</v>

1482
01:11:53.610 --> 01:11:58.610
<v Speaker 4>Can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can make laws for the other $30 </v>

1483
01:11:58.610 --> 01:12:00.090
<v Speaker 4>million they can.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's crazy.</v>

1484
01:12:00.120 --> 01:12:01.390
<v Speaker 4>It's fucking nuts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1485
01:12:01.800 --> 01:12:06.800
<v Speaker 4>It's nuts that to imagine that that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>how that human hive currently is </v>

1486
01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:10.881
<v Speaker 4>functioning,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that we assigned various queens and </v>

1487
01:12:10.881 --> 01:12:10.881
<v Speaker 4>kings,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1488
01:12:10.881 --> 01:12:13.490
<v Speaker 4>he gave people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we assigned people out of power and,</v>

1489
01:12:13.550 --> 01:12:14.820
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and worship.</v>

1490
01:12:14.821 --> 01:12:19.821
<v Speaker 4>Those people and hilarious ways and like</v>
<v Speaker 4>how cops fall into this horrible trap of</v>

1491
01:12:20.401 --> 01:12:24.750
<v Speaker 4>being involved in constant conflict,</v>
<v Speaker 4>back and forth,</v>

1492
01:12:24.751 --> 01:12:29.751
<v Speaker 4>constant conflict,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they get used to this position of </v>

1493
01:12:29.751 --> 01:12:32.721
<v Speaker 4>power and they get confused by this </v>
<v Speaker 4>position of power and this position of </v>

1494
01:12:32.721 --> 01:12:35.100
<v Speaker 4>being constantly in conflict and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>they come into things charged.</v>

1495
01:12:35.570 --> 01:12:40.570
<v Speaker 4>Somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Government people in government are </v>

1496
01:12:40.570 --> 01:12:40.570
<v Speaker 4>probably a lot the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You get someone,</v>

1497
01:12:40.570 --> 01:12:41.280
<v Speaker 4>you give them a position where they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>in charge.</v>

1498
01:12:41.281 --> 01:12:44.300
<v Speaker 4>Like Lyndon Johnson back in the sixties </v>
<v Speaker 4>when he didn't have.</v>

1499
01:12:44.450 --> 01:12:49.450
<v Speaker 4>You weren't really as responsible today </v>
<v Speaker 4>for every single thing you say or do </v>

1500
01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:53.670
<v Speaker 4>mean he could get away with a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 4>shifting shit back then.</v>

1501
01:12:53.700 --> 01:12:57.090
<v Speaker 4>And that guy was a scary dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah man.</v>

1502
01:12:57.190 --> 01:13:00.300
<v Speaker 4>That to go back to the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 4>part of that,</v>

1503
01:13:00.301 --> 01:13:02.390
<v Speaker 4>the cop example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1504
01:13:02.920 --> 01:13:07.080
<v Speaker 4>and why cops act the way that they act.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Somebody,</v>

1505
01:13:07.081 --> 01:13:12.081
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was doing a real shrill hippie rant </v>

1506
01:13:12.081 --> 01:13:13.830
<v Speaker 4>against cops and a man as really being </v>
<v Speaker 4>self righteous.</v>

1507
01:13:13.831 --> 01:13:17.130
<v Speaker 4>And I really got into full,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like trussell shrill,</v>

1508
01:13:17.131 --> 01:13:19.890
<v Speaker 4>raspy lesbian.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is an outrageous thing that airline</v>

1509
01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.270
<v Speaker 4>did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then somebody said this to me,</v>

1510
01:13:22.271 --> 01:13:22.800
<v Speaker 4>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

1511
01:13:22.801 --> 01:13:27.801
<v Speaker 4>I want you to imagine this man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have your wife is you have a </v>

1512
01:13:29.610 --> 01:13:34.610
<v Speaker 4>pregnant wife at home and some guy that </v>
<v Speaker 4>has got bad tags or whose car matches an</v>

1513
01:13:38.701 --> 01:13:42.750
<v Speaker 4>amber alert car,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whose car matches the car?</v>

1514
01:13:42.751 --> 01:13:47.751
<v Speaker 4>If somebody you killed some people a few</v>
<v Speaker 4>weeks ago drives in front of you,</v>

1515
01:13:48.750 --> 01:13:50.940
<v Speaker 4>and your job is to pull that person </v>
<v Speaker 4>over.</v>

1516
01:13:51.640 --> 01:13:54.210
<v Speaker 4>That person decides he doesn't want to </v>
<v Speaker 4>pull over.</v>

1517
01:13:54.450 --> 01:13:59.450
<v Speaker 4>So now you've got to chase this fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>person because if you don't chase this </v>

1518
01:13:59.450 --> 01:14:03.291
<v Speaker 4>person,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a possibility he's going to do </v>

1519
01:14:03.291 --> 01:14:04.881
<v Speaker 4>something else in the world and you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to have to deal with that guilt </v>

1520
01:14:04.881 --> 01:14:07.850
<v Speaker 4>for the rest of your life because you </v>
<v Speaker 4>didn't catch this guy could have been </v>

1521
01:14:07.850 --> 01:14:07.850
<v Speaker 4>this person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>See,</v>

1522
01:14:07.850 --> 01:14:08.880
<v Speaker 4>he chased this fucking person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>High speed,</v>

1523
01:14:08.881 --> 01:14:12.010
<v Speaker 4>fucking chase down the interstate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You look down at</v>

1524
01:14:12.010 --> 01:14:14.260
<v Speaker 7>your cell phone for a second.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's your wife calling.</v>

1525
01:14:14.470 --> 01:14:19.470
<v Speaker 7>She's pregnant.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You have a pregnant fucking wife and </v>

1526
01:14:19.470 --> 01:14:21.751
<v Speaker 7>you're driving a hundred and 15 miles </v>
<v Speaker 7>per hour down the interstate to chase </v>

1527
01:14:21.751 --> 01:14:26.131
<v Speaker 7>some fucking asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He's not pulling over who very </v>

1528
01:14:26.131 --> 01:14:29.131
<v Speaker 7>potentially as a weapon and they're </v>
<v Speaker 7>going to shoot you and your son or </v>

1529
01:14:29.131 --> 01:14:30.430
<v Speaker 7>daughter is going to grow up without a </v>
<v Speaker 7>daddy.</v>

1530
01:14:31.150 --> 01:14:34.900
<v Speaker 7>So when you finally get that person or a</v>
<v Speaker 7>group of your best friends,</v>

1531
01:14:34.930 --> 01:14:39.930
<v Speaker 7>get that person pulled over,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's going to be safe to say that your </v>

1532
01:14:39.930 --> 01:14:43.390
<v Speaker 7>adrenaline levels are going to be at </v>
<v Speaker 7>African bull.</v>

1533
01:14:43.450 --> 01:14:48.450
<v Speaker 7>Elephant level off the chart.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Your pulses pounding and you're gonna.</v>

1534
01:14:48.550 --> 01:14:53.550
<v Speaker 7>Get out of the fucking car and you're </v>
<v Speaker 7>not going to think probably unless </v>

1535
01:14:53.550 --> 01:14:55.570
<v Speaker 7>you're a zen master and you have full </v>
<v Speaker 7>control over yourself.</v>

1536
01:14:55.840 --> 01:15:00.840
<v Speaker 7>Like if you've ever gotten road ridge </v>
<v Speaker 7>where you've screamed at someone just </v>

1537
01:15:00.840 --> 01:15:00.840
<v Speaker 7>for cutting you off.</v>

1538
01:15:00.850 --> 01:15:05.850
<v Speaker 7>Think about the rage you would </v>
<v Speaker 7>experience once you finally tackle </v>

1539
01:15:05.850 --> 01:15:10.081
<v Speaker 7>somebody who just almost killed you and </v>
<v Speaker 7>a bunch of innocent people trying to </v>

1540
01:15:10.081 --> 01:15:12.820
<v Speaker 7>cross the street and a high speed </v>
<v Speaker 7>pursuit.</v>

1541
01:15:13.330 --> 01:15:18.330
<v Speaker 7>You are going to be angrier than you've </v>
<v Speaker 7>ever been in your fucking life.</v>

1542
01:15:18.820 --> 01:15:22.510
<v Speaker 7>And so I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>to maintain that kind of like calm,</v>

1543
01:15:23.050 --> 01:15:28.050
<v Speaker 7>placid professionalism that you're </v>
<v Speaker 7>supposed to maintain when every part of </v>

1544
01:15:28.050 --> 01:15:32.581
<v Speaker 7>your body is telling you to kill this </v>
<v Speaker 7>threat and your life is not exactly the </v>

1545
01:15:32.771 --> 01:15:36.700
<v Speaker 7>easiest thing ever.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm not excusing cop violence.</v>

1546
01:15:36.701 --> 01:15:38.230
<v Speaker 7>I'm just saying if you really look at </v>
<v Speaker 7>it,</v>

1547
01:15:38.231 --> 01:15:41.560
<v Speaker 7>you can empathize with why you as an </v>
<v Speaker 7>individual,</v>

1548
01:15:41.561 --> 01:15:46.561
<v Speaker 7>if you put yourself in that position,</v>
<v Speaker 7>might not be able to stop your elbow </v>

1549
01:15:47.021 --> 01:15:52.021
<v Speaker 7>from landing on.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That person's back a little harder than </v>

1550
01:15:52.021 --> 01:15:52.021
<v Speaker 7>it needed to because you're fucking </v>
<v Speaker 7>pissed.</v>

1551
01:15:52.021 --> 01:15:54.190
<v Speaker 7>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>So somebody explained that to me.</v>

1552
01:15:54.190 --> 01:15:55.360
<v Speaker 7>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>oh shit,</v>

1553
01:15:55.361 --> 01:15:56.230
<v Speaker 7>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

1554
01:15:56.231 --> 01:15:58.210
<v Speaker 7>I do understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You're right.</v>

1555
01:15:58.450 --> 01:16:01.630
<v Speaker 7>Still wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Still cops shouldn't beat fucking people</v>

1556
01:16:01.631 --> 01:16:04.750
<v Speaker 7>up and a lot of times they do it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's obviously associate bath.</v>

1557
01:16:05.020 --> 01:16:10.020
<v Speaker 7>He's gotten the job of a cop,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but a lot of times it's somebody who </v>

1558
01:16:10.020 --> 01:16:10.150
<v Speaker 7>really got into the job because they </v>
<v Speaker 7>were like,</v>

1559
01:16:10.151 --> 01:16:15.151
<v Speaker 7>fuck man,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't want to do good things in the </v>

1560
01:16:15.151 --> 01:16:16.000
<v Speaker 7>world and they're not perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We got to lighten up a little bit.</v>

1561
01:16:16.001 --> 01:16:17.790
<v Speaker 7>I got to lighten up a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I got like,</v>

1562
01:16:17.940 --> 01:16:20.680
<v Speaker 7>I think it's a job that almost no one's </v>
<v Speaker 7>qualified to do.</v>

1563
01:16:20.681 --> 01:16:22.930
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think that you could talk to a guy.</v>

1564
01:16:22.931 --> 01:16:26.140
<v Speaker 7>I know a dude who got mugged once and he</v>
<v Speaker 7>has ptsd,</v>

1565
01:16:26.230 --> 01:16:28.810
<v Speaker 7>like it freaks them out of kids not </v>
<v Speaker 7>married one time.</v>

1566
01:16:28.811 --> 01:16:33.811
<v Speaker 7>We got mugged one time and you know he </v>
<v Speaker 7>has what he calls post traumatic stress </v>

1567
01:16:33.811 --> 01:16:33.811
<v Speaker 7>disorder.</v>

1568
01:16:33.811 --> 01:16:34.750
<v Speaker 7>It,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it changed his life.</v>

1569
01:16:35.200 --> 01:16:40.200
<v Speaker 7>Like you mentioned,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we ain't a fucking cop and every single </v>

01:18:05.091 --> 01:18:10.091
<v Speaker 6>as an entity,</v>
<v Speaker 6>obviously the police department as a </v>

01:18:10.091 --> 01:18:12.431
<v Speaker 6>state to get funded by the state because</v>

<v Speaker 6>that and then their personal life is </v>
<v Speaker 6>chaotic.</v>

1636
01:19:17.330 --> 01:19:19.940
<v Speaker 6>Maybe they married the wrong person,</v>

1640
01:19:29.830 --> 01:19:31.841
<v Speaker 6>have to deal with and the idea that you </v>
<v Speaker 6>would give one civilian who's not a </v>

1642
01:19:37.511 --> 01:19:40.451
<v Speaker 6>enlightenment that you could show me </v>
<v Speaker 6>that you can be completely without </v>

1643
01:19:40.451 --> 01:19:41.210
<v Speaker 6>judgment and treat everyone with </v>
<v Speaker 6>kindness and love.</v>

<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no.</v>

<v Speaker 6>You're just a guy who just a regular guy</v>
<v Speaker 6>and then you put in this position where </v>

<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

1649
01:19:52.490 --> 01:19:57.490
<v Speaker 6>being a cop is like a bean in a positive</v>
<v Speaker 6>gang and you're going out there and </v>

1650
01:19:57.490 --> 01:20:01.331
<v Speaker 6>you're doing battle with all the </v>
<v Speaker 6>negative gangs and there's a bunch of </v>

<v Speaker 6>them and you know you've got to make </v>
<v Speaker 6>relationships and sometimes you gotta </v>

1652
01:20:04.841 --> 01:20:04.841
<v Speaker 6>put your foot down some pop.</v>

1653
01:20:04.841 --> 01:20:09.280
<v Speaker 6>Sometimes you get a drag.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Someone's fucking ass to jail to teach </v>

<v Speaker 6>trying to scratch out survival through </v>

1657
01:20:18.530 --> 01:20:22.521
<v Speaker 6>crime.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The scariest people you could come in </v>

1658
01:20:22.521 --> 01:20:25.341

<v Speaker 6>you're involved with really hard people </v>

1661
01:20:31.731 --> 01:20:36.650
<v Speaker 6>that have grown up in hard neighborhoods</v>
<v Speaker 6>and they will fucking sucker punch you </v>

01:20:42.800 --> 01:20:42.800
<v Speaker 6>they're going to go back to jail.</v>

<v Speaker 6>these cages and turn into worse,</v>

1675
01:21:10.110 --> 01:21:13.560
<v Speaker 6>scarier criminals and then released </v>

<v Speaker 6>to stay in a halfway house.</v>

1679
01:21:22.520 --> 01:21:25.200
<v Speaker 6>Wherever the fuck you have to do and you</v>
<v Speaker 6>don't have any job prospects and next </v>

01:21:49.610 --> 01:21:52.350
<v Speaker 6>Your hands on somebody's squad car.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 6>You realize you have a hole in your </v>
<v Speaker 6>head,</v>

1692
01:21:55.501 --> 01:22:00.501
<v Speaker 6>but you're still seeing how your left </v>
<v Speaker 6>eye and you watch your life slip away </v>

<v Speaker 6>from you.</v>

1694
01:22:00.501 --> 01:22:01.980
<v Speaker 6>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Because you've got the wrong gig.</v>

1695
01:22:02.190 --> 01:22:04.170
<v Speaker 6>Every.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Everybody that's a cop has to think like</v>

1696
01:22:04.171 --> 01:22:04.680
<v Speaker 6>that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Man.</v>

1697
01:22:05.170 --> 01:22:08.100
<v Speaker 6>Those possibilities aren't just.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's not just.</v>

1698
01:22:08.101 --> 01:22:10.020
<v Speaker 6>It could happen.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It has.</v>

1699
01:22:10.160 --> 01:22:13.230
<v Speaker 6>It absolutely does.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's so many cops get murdered on the</v>

1700
01:22:13.231 --> 01:22:14.220
<v Speaker 6>job.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So many.</v>

1701
01:22:14.370 --> 01:22:16.530
<v Speaker 6>There's so many.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's so many videos of it.</v>

1702
01:22:16.710 --> 01:22:20.330
<v Speaker 6>You know the idea that all these cops </v>
<v Speaker 6>that have killed people or senior,</v>

1703
01:22:20.331 --> 01:22:25.331
<v Speaker 6>really the problem,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's a whole big problem and the </v>

1704
01:22:25.331 --> 01:22:25.331
<v Speaker 6>problem is the way human beings treat </v>
<v Speaker 6>each other.</v>

1705
01:22:25.620 --> 01:22:28.620
<v Speaker 6>The need for cops in the first place is </v>
<v Speaker 6>the problem.</v>

1706
01:22:28.740 --> 01:22:31.110
<v Speaker 6>Before the idea of cops being the </v>
<v Speaker 6>problem.</v>

1707
01:22:31.500 --> 01:22:36.500
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>everybody wants to look at police </v>

1708
01:22:36.500 --> 01:22:38.631
<v Speaker 6>violence for good reason.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a very important subject right now </v>

1709
01:22:38.631 --> 01:22:41.810
<v Speaker 6>for all of us,</v>
<v Speaker 6>especially when it has connotations of </v>

1710
01:22:41.810 --> 01:22:44.760
<v Speaker 6>when it's got connections to racism.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's got connections to sexual issues </v>

1711
01:22:44.760 --> 01:22:45.250
<v Speaker 6>was also,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1712
01:22:45.270 --> 01:22:50.270
<v Speaker 6>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when you see a man punch a woman in a </v>

1713
01:22:50.270 --> 01:22:51.000
<v Speaker 6>situation where you probably don't think</v>
<v Speaker 6>he would punch a guy,</v>

1714
01:22:51.140 --> 01:22:53.910
<v Speaker 6>you know there's.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's a lot of weird shit that happens</v>

1715
01:22:53.940 --> 01:22:56.670
<v Speaker 6>with police officers interacting with </v>
<v Speaker 6>human beings.</v>

1716
01:22:56.970 --> 01:23:00.960
<v Speaker 6>The idea that anybody is qualified to </v>
<v Speaker 6>hold that position and have that kind of</v>

1717
01:23:00.961 --> 01:23:03.880
<v Speaker 6>power just by being a regular guy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Good luck,</v>

1718
01:23:04.360 --> 01:23:05.500
<v Speaker 6>good luck,</v>
<v Speaker 6>good luck,</v>

1719
01:23:06.190 --> 01:23:10.360
<v Speaker 4>good luck trying to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the problem is that it exists at all</v>

1720
01:23:10.361 --> 01:23:15.361
<v Speaker 4>that we needed it all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The problem is that there are all these </v>

1721
01:23:15.361 --> 01:23:17.911
<v Speaker 4>crimes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The problem is that we do beat each </v>

1722
01:23:17.911 --> 01:23:20.041
<v Speaker 4>other up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You do have domestic violence issues </v>

1723
01:23:20.041 --> 01:23:20.041
<v Speaker 4>where you show up and some guys beating </v>
<v Speaker 4>his wife up.</v>

1724
01:23:20.540 --> 01:23:23.290
<v Speaker 4>Those are real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You really are going to encounter that.</v>

1725
01:23:23.470 --> 01:23:28.470
<v Speaker 4>Those are really the problems.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The fact that we need police at all are </v>

1726
01:23:28.470 --> 01:23:29.890
<v Speaker 4>the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's these issues,</v>

1727
01:23:29.891 --> 01:23:31.180
<v Speaker 4>these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these events,</v>

1728
01:23:31.300 --> 01:23:31.770
<v Speaker 4>these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these,</v>

1729
01:23:31.800 --> 01:23:34.630
<v Speaker 4>these patterns of human behavior that </v>
<v Speaker 4>are horrible,</v>

1730
01:23:34.750 --> 01:23:37.600
<v Speaker 4>where were horrible to each other.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those are the fucking problems.</v>

1731
01:23:37.750 --> 01:23:42.750
<v Speaker 4>Everything from that is just the wrong </v>
<v Speaker 4>solution to deal with that problem.</v>

1732
01:23:43.270 --> 01:23:47.600
<v Speaker 4>One of the wrong solutions so that just </v>
<v Speaker 4>about anybody be a cop and you give them</v>

1733
01:23:47.601 --> 01:23:52.601
<v Speaker 4>a gun and you give them some training </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you send them with their weak </v>

1734
01:23:52.601 --> 01:23:56.370
<v Speaker 4>fucking character out there in the world</v>
<v Speaker 4>because not everybody's big John </v>

1735
01:23:56.370 --> 01:23:56.830
<v Speaker 4>Mccarthy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of bitches out there.</v>

1736
01:23:57.010 --> 01:24:00.370
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of dudes that get to be a </v>
<v Speaker 4>cop and there really are a bitch.</v>

1737
01:24:00.400 --> 01:24:01.720
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's a fact.</v>

1738
01:24:01.840 --> 01:24:05.170
<v Speaker 4>And if you put that guy in a stressful </v>
<v Speaker 4>situation where it's all going down,</v>

1739
01:24:05.560 --> 01:24:07.600
<v Speaker 4>he's gonna probably fucking panic.</v>

1740
01:24:07.650 --> 01:24:10.560
<v Speaker 7>Like that pool party,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that legendary pool.</v>

1741
01:24:10.590 --> 01:24:11.880
<v Speaker 7>You saw that pool party,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

1742
01:24:11.881 --> 01:24:14.700
<v Speaker 7>Where the cop,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like there's some girl in a bikini,</v>

1743
01:24:14.701 --> 01:24:17.600
<v Speaker 7>throws her to the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He does that barrel.</v>

1744
01:24:17.790 --> 01:24:21.090
<v Speaker 7>He comes in with a barrel.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's so fucking hilarious.</v>

1745
01:24:21.091 --> 01:24:23.280
<v Speaker 7>Like this is his dream.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That is the problem.</v>

1746
01:24:23.281 --> 01:24:27.240
<v Speaker 7>It's like not everybody's becoming cops </v>
<v Speaker 7>for the exact same reason,</v>

1747
01:24:27.570 --> 01:24:32.570
<v Speaker 7>but what you just did,</v>
<v Speaker 7>all of that man is really important </v>

1748
01:24:32.570 --> 01:24:35.460
<v Speaker 7>because it helps people empathize with </v>
<v Speaker 7>most of them.</v>

1749
01:24:35.490 --> 01:24:37.740
<v Speaker 7>And that's the ticket right there,</v>
<v Speaker 7>man.</v>

1750
01:24:37.800 --> 01:24:42.800
<v Speaker 7>We've got to learn how to empathize.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They've got to learn how to empathize </v>

1751
01:24:42.800 --> 01:24:46.071
<v Speaker 7>with us too,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like they've got to understand that a </v>

1752
01:24:46.071 --> 01:24:46.071
<v Speaker 7>lot of the people that they're </v>
<v Speaker 7>attacking,</v>

1753
01:24:46.530 --> 01:24:49.620
<v Speaker 7>they're attacking them for drug laws </v>
<v Speaker 7>that shouldn't exist anyway.</v>

1754
01:24:49.860 --> 01:24:51.390
<v Speaker 7>And so that's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's uh,</v>

1755
01:24:51.391 --> 01:24:52.950
<v Speaker 7>if we,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if we get a lot of it,</v>

1756
01:24:52.951 --> 01:24:54.030
<v Speaker 7>but there's a lot of other shit.</v>

1757
01:24:54.230 --> 01:24:57.060
<v Speaker 7>But if we could get that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if we can get rid of the drug,</v>

1758
01:24:57.090 --> 01:24:58.950
<v Speaker 7>if we can get rid of the prohibition on </v>
<v Speaker 7>drugs,</v>

1759
01:24:59.340 --> 01:25:01.260
<v Speaker 7>however we do it,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't care.</v>

1760
01:25:01.261 --> 01:25:04.800
<v Speaker 7>But if we can get rid of the prohibition</v>
<v Speaker 7>on drugs so that now cops are just,</v>

1761
01:25:04.801 --> 01:25:08.850
<v Speaker 7>as Graham Hancock points out,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there's already laws in place for people</v>

1762
01:25:08.851 --> 01:25:13.851
<v Speaker 7>doing awful things under the influence </v>
<v Speaker 7>of drugs or not under the influence of </v>

1763
01:25:13.851 --> 01:25:16.200
<v Speaker 7>drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We just need to enforce those.</v>

1764
01:25:16.230 --> 01:25:18.240
<v Speaker 7>Not the drug laws themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Right?</v>

1765
01:25:18.420 --> 01:25:21.330
<v Speaker 7>So if,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if we remove that from the equation.</v>

1766
01:25:21.331 --> 01:25:26.331
<v Speaker 7>So these poor cops aren't being told to </v>
<v Speaker 7>go out into the world and instead of </v>

1767
01:25:27.061 --> 01:25:29.310
<v Speaker 7>being heroes,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you've also got a pole,</v>

1768
01:25:29.640 --> 01:25:34.640
<v Speaker 7>relatively benign white powder out of </v>
<v Speaker 7>the pockets of people who have $15 in </v>

1769
01:25:34.891 --> 01:25:39.891
<v Speaker 7>the bank and only one experience,</v>
<v Speaker 7>a temporary moment of bliss before they </v>

1770
01:25:39.891 --> 01:25:44.181
<v Speaker 7>pass out.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If you remove that component of their </v>

1771
01:25:44.181 --> 01:25:47.781
<v Speaker 7>job and just like stop people from </v>
<v Speaker 7>beating and killing each other and from </v>

1772
01:25:47.781 --> 01:25:52.521
<v Speaker 7>stealing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Don't worry about the drugs that now </v>

1773
01:25:52.521 --> 01:25:54.240
<v Speaker 7>we've got heroes.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Now we've got night's riding through the</v>

1774
01:25:54.241 --> 01:25:59.241
<v Speaker 7>land who are actually doing everything </v>
<v Speaker 7>they can to make people be cool instead </v>

1775
01:25:59.761 --> 01:26:04.460
<v Speaker 7>of nights riding through the land.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We want to pull plant matter</v>

1776
01:26:04.640 --> 01:26:09.290
<v Speaker 6>out of a 16 year olds pocket and act </v>
<v Speaker 6>like the kid just assassinated Kennedy.</v>

1777
01:26:09.590 --> 01:26:11.590
<v Speaker 6>That's not what we need.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I think that's the.</v>

1778
01:26:11.620 --> 01:26:16.620
<v Speaker 6>Once you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Once you fucking fix the prohibition on </v>

1779
01:26:16.620 --> 01:26:16.620
<v Speaker 6>drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>

1780
01:26:16.620 --> 01:26:20.171
<v Speaker 6>then I think police officers are going </v>
<v Speaker 6>to experience the same kind of respect </v>

1781
01:26:20.171 --> 01:26:21.530
<v Speaker 6>that firemen get.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's how it should be.</v>

1782
01:26:21.531 --> 01:26:24.260
<v Speaker 6>And one step further,</v>
<v Speaker 6>once they legalized marijuana,</v>

1783
01:26:24.261 --> 01:26:29.261
<v Speaker 6>everyone's going to start smoking pot </v>
<v Speaker 6>and you're going to get a lot more </v>

1784
01:26:29.261 --> 01:26:29.261
<v Speaker 6>relaxed.</v>
<v Speaker 6>People,</v>

1785
01:26:29.261 --> 01:26:32.651
<v Speaker 6>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're going to get people that are a </v>

1786
01:26:32.651 --> 01:26:32.651
<v Speaker 6>lot more introspective.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

1787
01:26:32.651 --> 01:26:34.280
<v Speaker 6>what are you saying?</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is what I'm saying.</v>

1788
01:26:34.310 --> 01:26:39.310
<v Speaker 6>If you don't believe that a lot more </v>
<v Speaker 6>people smoking pot would have a </v>

1789
01:26:39.310 --> 01:26:41.540
<v Speaker 6>significant impact on the way human </v>
<v Speaker 6>beings interact with each other.</v>

1790
01:26:41.810 --> 01:26:44.030
<v Speaker 6>All that means to me is you don't smoke </v>
<v Speaker 6>pot,</v>

1791
01:26:44.720 --> 01:26:46.400
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Because if you smoke pot,</v>

1792
01:26:46.401 --> 01:26:48.170
<v Speaker 6>you would know that that's exactly what </v>
<v Speaker 6>would happen.</v>

1793
01:26:48.260 --> 01:26:50.840
<v Speaker 6>People would become more empathetic.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Not across the board.</v>

1794
01:26:50.841 --> 01:26:51.890
<v Speaker 6>Not always.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's.</v>

1795
01:26:51.920 --> 01:26:56.920
<v Speaker 6>There's always gonna be people that are.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The exception to the rule is always </v>

1796
01:26:56.920 --> 01:26:56.920
<v Speaker 6>going to be people that just don't get </v>
<v Speaker 6>it yet.</v>

1797
01:26:56.920 --> 01:26:57.680
<v Speaker 6>There's always going to be people that </v>
<v Speaker 6>get it and they don't need.</v>

1798
01:26:57.920 --> 01:27:02.920
<v Speaker 6>They don't need anything.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They just tuned in and they're kind and </v>

1799
01:27:02.920 --> 01:27:03.290
<v Speaker 6>they're on point and they're living in </v>
<v Speaker 6>the moment and all that good shit,</v>

1800
01:27:03.560 --> 01:27:08.560
<v Speaker 6>but then there's other people that </v>
<v Speaker 6>benefit from those things and you deny </v>

1801
01:27:08.560 --> 01:27:11.471
<v Speaker 6>those people the opportunity to benefit </v>
<v Speaker 6>from those things and then you become </v>

1802
01:27:11.471 --> 01:27:11.471
<v Speaker 6>the enemy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You become the Fuzz,</v>

1803
01:27:11.471 --> 01:27:15.980
<v Speaker 6>you become the man and then you're a </v>
<v Speaker 6>fucking glorified revenue collector too.</v>

1804
01:27:16.130 --> 01:27:17.300
<v Speaker 6>What are you really doing?</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're going to get,</v>

1805
01:27:17.301 --> 01:27:20.900
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to get a fine.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I got to go to court and pay the court.</v>

1806
01:27:21.520 --> 01:27:23.150
<v Speaker 6>Fine.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What am I paying?</v>

1807
01:27:23.150 --> 01:27:28.150
<v Speaker 6>I'm giving you money.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You need thousands of dollars because I </v>

1808
01:27:28.150 --> 01:27:28.150
<v Speaker 6>like plants.</v>
<v Speaker 6>How about fuck you?</v>

1809
01:27:28.370 --> 01:27:33.370
<v Speaker 6>What kind of crazy shit is this?</v>
<v Speaker 6>You can lock me in a cage and charge me </v>

1810
01:27:33.370 --> 01:27:36.230
<v Speaker 6>money because I like plants or you're </v>
<v Speaker 6>the arbiter of nature.</v>

1811
01:27:36.231 --> 01:27:41.231
<v Speaker 6>You're the one who gets to decide what's</v>
<v Speaker 6>beneficial and what's not with zero </v>

1812
01:27:41.231 --> 01:27:43.690
<v Speaker 6>evidence behind it whatsoever,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which was one.</v>

1813
01:27:43.800 --> 01:27:45.770
<v Speaker 6>It's one of the most heinous crimes on </v>
<v Speaker 6>nature.</v>

1814
01:27:45.950 --> 01:27:50.950
<v Speaker 6>The illegalization of marijuana is one </v>
<v Speaker 6>of the most heinous crimes on nature </v>

1815
01:27:50.950 --> 01:27:53.630
<v Speaker 6>that mankind has ever,</v>
<v Speaker 6>ever put forth.</v>

1816
01:27:53.720 --> 01:27:58.720
<v Speaker 6>And we're doing it to ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's even worse than most of the shit </v>

1817
01:27:58.720 --> 01:28:01.030
<v Speaker 6>that we do to other planets or to other,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1818
01:28:01.040 --> 01:28:06.040
<v Speaker 6>other animals by torturing them or by </v>
<v Speaker 6>killing them or by poisoning the lakes </v>

1819
01:28:07.641 --> 01:28:08.970
<v Speaker 6>and the rivers.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And W,</v>

1820
01:28:08.980 --> 01:28:13.980
<v Speaker 6>we're pleasing the consciousness of </v>
<v Speaker 6>ourselves by not allowing people to have</v>

1821
01:28:14.571 --> 01:28:18.350
<v Speaker 6>freedom to experiment with all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 6>different states of consciousness.</v>

1822
01:28:18.950 --> 01:28:22.160
<v Speaker 6>You have illegal way to do it through </v>
<v Speaker 6>yoga.</v>

1823
01:28:22.190 --> 01:28:25.460
<v Speaker 6>You have a legal way to do it through </v>
<v Speaker 6>prescription medication.</v>

1824
01:28:25.610 --> 01:28:29.120
<v Speaker 6>You have a legal way to do it through </v>
<v Speaker 6>alcohol and things that we tax,</v>

1825
01:28:29.510 --> 01:28:34.510
<v Speaker 6>but if you decide that you want to try </v>
<v Speaker 6>to do it in a way that we haven't </v>

1826
01:28:34.510 --> 01:28:36.620
<v Speaker 6>sanctioned and we don't get paid for,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we don't get taxes from,</v>

1827
01:28:36.890 --> 01:28:40.870
<v Speaker 6>we'll lock you in a fucking cage for the</v>
<v Speaker 6>rest of your life.</v>

1828
01:28:40.950 --> 01:28:42.530
<v Speaker 6>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>For the.</v>

1829
01:28:43.080 --> 01:28:48.080
<v Speaker 6>The differences as far as impact,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like the physical danger significantly </v>

1830
01:28:48.171 --> 01:28:49.730
<v Speaker 6>less than any of the ones that you have </v>
<v Speaker 6>league.</v>

1831
01:28:49.760 --> 01:28:54.760
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I get is the one that you can't die </v>

1832
01:28:54.760 --> 01:28:54.760
<v Speaker 6>from.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You can die from aspirin.</v>

1833
01:28:54.760 --> 01:28:56.990
<v Speaker 6>There's not a single fucking person that</v>
<v Speaker 6>wants you to ban aspirin.</v>

1834
01:28:56.991 --> 01:29:01.991
<v Speaker 6>There's no band aspirin movement.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's no like we've got to take these </v>

1835
01:29:01.991 --> 01:29:02.250
<v Speaker 6>aspirin or you just eat a of aspirin.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're fucked.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Ban.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're dead.</v>

1837
01:29:03.690 --> 01:29:04.410

<v Speaker 4>If you.</v>

1838
01:29:04.411 --> 01:29:07.380
<v Speaker 4>If you have one of those bare fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>aspirins was bigger,</v>

1839
01:29:07.540 --> 01:29:09.510
<v Speaker 4>I'd guarantee if you chug that whole </v>
<v Speaker 4>bottle down,</v>

1840
01:29:09.511 --> 01:29:14.511
<v Speaker 4>you'd or pure caffeine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't forget that a kids die all the </v>

1841
01:29:14.511 --> 01:29:15.180
<v Speaker 4>time from ordering pure caffeine from </v>
<v Speaker 4>Amazon.</v>

1842
01:29:15.181 --> 01:29:17.430
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if they still sell it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they used to sell pure caffeine.</v>

1843
01:29:17.431 --> 01:29:22.431
<v Speaker 4>You hear it all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>kid like party takes a teaspoonful of </v>

1844
01:29:22.431 --> 01:29:24.000
<v Speaker 4>pure caffeine and that's it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1845
01:29:24.160 --> 01:29:25.610
<v Speaker 4>Dead dead meat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1846
01:29:25.620 --> 01:29:27.810
<v Speaker 4>your heart just flies right out of your </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking chest.</v>

1847
01:29:27.811 --> 01:29:29.070
<v Speaker 4>Like a bird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1848
01:29:29.190 --> 01:29:31.890
<v Speaker 4>that's right man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And how about just water?</v>

1849
01:29:31.950 --> 01:29:36.950
<v Speaker 4>I mean there was that woman on a radio </v>
<v Speaker 4>station in Sacramento or something a </v>

1850
01:29:36.950 --> 01:29:37.530
<v Speaker 4>year,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a few years back.</v>

1851
01:29:37.620 --> 01:29:41.790
<v Speaker 4>She was involved in some sort of contest</v>
<v Speaker 4>to see who could drink the most water.</v>

1852
01:29:42.240 --> 01:29:44.090
<v Speaker 4>And if you drank the most water,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1853
01:29:44.091 --> 01:29:45.450
<v Speaker 4>you got a prize hair member.</v>

1854
01:29:45.460 --> 01:29:47.910
<v Speaker 4>She fucking died.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's terrible.</v>

1855
01:29:48.470 --> 01:29:50.530
<v Speaker 4>She went home to her.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean she,</v>

1856
01:29:50.540 --> 01:29:55.540
<v Speaker 4>she was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she was on her way home or something </v>

1857
01:29:55.540 --> 01:29:55.540
<v Speaker 4>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She had a,</v>

1858
01:29:55.540 --> 01:29:57.890
<v Speaker 4>she had a daughter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She was just trying to make some extra </v>

1859
01:29:57.890 --> 01:29:57.890
<v Speaker 4>money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1860
01:29:57.890 --> 01:29:58.890
<v Speaker 4>When she died drinking water.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's insane.</v>

1861
01:29:58.960 --> 01:30:03.960
<v Speaker 4>It's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that wouldn't happen to you if you </v>

1862
01:30:03.960 --> 01:30:03.960
<v Speaker 4>smoke too much pot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's right.</v>

1863
01:30:03.960 --> 01:30:04.410
<v Speaker 4>Wouldn't happen to know if he ate too </v>
<v Speaker 4>much pot.</v>

1864
01:30:04.530 --> 01:30:06.840
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the idea that they're locking anybody</v>

1865
01:30:06.841 --> 01:30:10.440
<v Speaker 4>up for that is fucking ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you put cops in a position where they</v>

1866
01:30:10.530 --> 01:30:14.790
<v Speaker 4>have to enforce a law that they know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody knows is ridiculous,</v>

1867
01:30:15.060 --> 01:30:18.690
<v Speaker 4>then that cop is in a bad position in </v>
<v Speaker 4>society.</v>

1868
01:30:18.691 --> 01:30:23.340
<v Speaker 4>He becomes the enemy from the jump,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the enemy that he can't even agree with.</v>

1869
01:30:23.790 --> 01:30:26.760
<v Speaker 4>Most cops you talked to most cops,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't give a fuck about pot.</v>

1870
01:30:27.120 --> 01:30:30.330
<v Speaker 4>They don't want to have to enforce that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Most guys in their thirties,</v>

1871
01:30:30.450 --> 01:30:32.910
<v Speaker 4>you'd have to be a total complete piece </v>
<v Speaker 4>of shit.</v>

1872
01:30:32.911 --> 01:30:37.911
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>As a human being to be a cop and your </v>

1873
01:30:37.911 --> 01:30:38.580
<v Speaker 4>thirties and really want to arrest a </v>
<v Speaker 4>regular person that's not doing anything</v>

1874
01:30:38.581 --> 01:30:39.900
<v Speaker 4>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who happens to have a joint on them?</v>

1875
01:30:40.320 --> 01:30:44.760
<v Speaker 4>You got to be a piece of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If this guy didn't do anything wrong and</v>

1876
01:30:44.761 --> 01:30:46.380
<v Speaker 4>he has a joint on them and you want to </v>
<v Speaker 4>arrest him,</v>

1877
01:30:46.650 --> 01:30:51.240
<v Speaker 4>you're a cunt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yet of beyond all the scripture.</v>

1878
01:30:51.241 --> 01:30:52.270
<v Speaker 4>Adult.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1879
01:30:52.500 --> 01:30:55.590
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a problem because that is the law</v>

1880
01:30:55.860 --> 01:30:57.960
<v Speaker 4>in most states.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is the law,</v>

1881
01:30:58.020 --> 01:31:01.920
<v Speaker 4>like they're supposed to arrest you for </v>
<v Speaker 4>that most states most,</v>

1882
01:31:01.960 --> 01:31:03.450
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Which is insane.</v>

1883
01:31:03.600 --> 01:31:04.500
<v Speaker 4>We,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here we are,</v>

1884
01:31:04.760 --> 01:31:09.760
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we were sending videos with the sky </v>

1885
01:31:09.760 --> 01:31:09.760
<v Speaker 4>phone to phone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're,</v>

1886
01:31:09.760 --> 01:31:13.710
<v Speaker 4>we're periscoping and livestreaming and </v>
<v Speaker 4>driving around in cars that have </v>

1887
01:31:13.921 --> 01:31:15.600
<v Speaker 4>satellites connected to them.</v>

1888
01:31:15.600 --> 01:31:19.350
<v Speaker 4>They tell you exactly what street you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>on and how when the turns coming up,</v>

1889
01:31:19.351 --> 01:31:23.790
<v Speaker 4>they give you a ding Dong to tell you to</v>
<v Speaker 4>turn exactly where you are.</v>

1890
01:31:24.180 --> 01:31:26.090
<v Speaker 4>And yet we still have that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1891
01:31:26.091 --> 01:31:28.380
<v Speaker 4>But it's changing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is changing and it's,</v>

1892
01:31:28.381 --> 01:31:31.590
<v Speaker 4>it just doesn't happen as fast as,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as stones would like it to change.</v>

1893
01:31:31.591 --> 01:31:36.591
<v Speaker 4>Like it seems so obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You want the thing to flip around </v>

1894
01:31:36.591 --> 01:31:39.141
<v Speaker 4>instantly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's almost like they can't do that </v>

1895
01:31:39.141 --> 01:31:39.160
<v Speaker 4>because then they would have to admit </v>
<v Speaker 4>fault or it's it.</v>

1896
01:31:39.190 --> 01:31:44.190
<v Speaker 4>It's almost like there's just a terrible</v>
<v Speaker 4>bureaucratic web that uh,</v>

1897
01:31:45.690 --> 01:31:50.690
<v Speaker 4>it takes time to make things change.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you're using that bureaucratic web.</v>

1898
01:31:51.121 --> 01:31:52.590
<v Speaker 4>That's the fucking problem,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1899
01:31:52.860 --> 01:31:56.790
<v Speaker 4>And things are slow but shit there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's happening.</v>

1900
01:31:56.850 --> 01:31:58.770
<v Speaker 4>It is happening.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's going to become legal.</v>

1901
01:31:58.771 --> 01:31:59.890
<v Speaker 4>We can't stop there.</v>

1902
01:32:00.130 --> 01:32:04.440
<v Speaker 3>We've got to get psilocybin a </v>
<v Speaker 3>prescribed,</v>

1903
01:32:04.540 --> 01:32:09.540
<v Speaker 3>at the very least.</v>
<v Speaker 3>MTMA needs to be a prescription </v>

1904
01:32:09.540 --> 01:32:12.571
<v Speaker 3>medication.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All psychoactive substances like Iowasca</v>

1905
01:32:13.360 --> 01:32:16.300
<v Speaker 3>DMT.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All of these things need to be studied,</v>

1906
01:32:16.360 --> 01:32:21.360
<v Speaker 3>they need to be researched and then they</v>
<v Speaker 3>need to get into the hands of doctors </v>

1907
01:32:21.401 --> 01:32:24.190
<v Speaker 3>who could really use them to help </v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

1908
01:32:24.910 --> 01:32:29.910
<v Speaker 3>It could be an incredible tool for </v>
<v Speaker 3>helping people who are suffering right </v>

1909
01:32:29.910 --> 01:32:32.530
<v Speaker 3>now and the whole thing's all gummed up </v>
<v Speaker 3>and that is a true tragedy.</v>

1910
01:32:32.531 --> 01:32:36.100
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't stop with marijuana though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It goes all the way through the spectrum</v>

1911
01:32:36.101 --> 01:32:39.700
<v Speaker 3>of drugs and it also goes to the very </v>
<v Speaker 3>creepy,</v>

1912
01:32:40.920 --> 01:32:45.920
<v Speaker 3>unacknowledged a problem with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>pharmaceutical companies which are </v>

1913
01:32:47.560 --> 01:32:52.560
<v Speaker 3>releasing heroin on a daily basis into </v>
<v Speaker 3>the bloodstream of this species and </v>

1914
01:32:53.201 --> 01:32:55.240
<v Speaker 3>they're not being treated like heroin </v>
<v Speaker 3>dealers.</v>

1915
01:32:55.241 --> 01:33:00.241
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people are getting addicted to </v>
<v Speaker 3>super powerful pharmaceutical </v>

1916
01:33:00.241 --> 01:33:04.860
<v Speaker 3>medications and I don't think the </v>
<v Speaker 3>pharmaceutical companies are being held </v>

1917
01:33:04.860 --> 01:33:08.440
<v Speaker 3>to any kind of tea to anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just for whatever reason,</v>

1918
01:33:08.441 --> 01:33:13.441
<v Speaker 3>if I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If your friend gets addicted to oxy </v>

1919
01:33:13.441 --> 01:33:15.700
<v Speaker 3>cotton because his back was thrown out </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you hear that story,</v>

1920
01:33:15.940 --> 01:33:18.670
<v Speaker 3>you're supposed to feel a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 3>more empathy towards them.</v>

1921
01:33:18.671 --> 01:33:23.671
<v Speaker 3>Then if you hear somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got addicted to black tar heroin </v>

1922
01:33:23.671 --> 01:33:23.671
<v Speaker 3>when it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1923
01:33:23.671 --> 01:33:24.220
<v Speaker 3>it's the same fucking thing.</v>

1924
01:33:24.240 --> 01:33:29.240
<v Speaker 6>Thing like wasn't that part of the </v>
<v Speaker 6>argument with the Silk Road trial was </v>

1925
01:33:29.240 --> 01:33:32.261
<v Speaker 6>that this young man who had run that </v>
<v Speaker 6>website that allowed people to buy all </v>

1926
01:33:32.261 --> 01:33:36.941
<v Speaker 6>sorts of illegal drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he had been directly responsible for </v>

1927
01:33:36.941 --> 01:33:40.571
<v Speaker 6>people overdosing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He'd been directly responsible for </v>

1928
01:33:40.571 --> 01:33:43.691
<v Speaker 6>people that may have committed some </v>
<v Speaker 6>crimes and done some shitty things were </v>

1929
01:33:43.691 --> 01:33:47.480
<v Speaker 6>on those drugs and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he had to face the parents of people who</v>

1930
01:33:47.481 --> 01:33:52.481
<v Speaker 6>bought drugs and overdosed in some form.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know the specifics of the case,</v>

1931
01:33:53.900 --> 01:33:55.660
<v Speaker 6>but that was part of what they were </v>
<v Speaker 6>charging them for.</v>

1932
01:33:55.870 --> 01:33:57.190
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how come that never gets brought up with</v>

1933
01:33:57.210 --> 01:34:02.210
<v Speaker 6>pharmaceutical companies?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Because I mean think about all the </v>

1934
01:34:02.210 --> 01:34:04.481
<v Speaker 6>different people you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so you're not responsible for your own </v>

1935
01:34:04.481 --> 01:34:04.890
<v Speaker 6>actions as long as the drugs illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

1936
01:34:04.910 --> 01:34:09.910
<v Speaker 6>But you are responsible for your own </v>
<v Speaker 6>actions if the drugs legal and </v>

1937
01:34:09.910 --> 01:34:11.300
<v Speaker 6>prescribed by a doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but maybe even more addictive.</v>

1938
01:34:11.301 --> 01:34:12.200
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>wait a minute,</v>

1949
01:34:32.560 --> 01:34:32.560
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

1950
01:34:32.770 --> 01:34:35.440
<v Speaker 3>One of the news stories is how they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to find his dealer.</v>

1951
01:34:35.470 --> 01:34:36.010
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>

1952

<v Speaker 3>we're going to hunt down the guy who </v>
<v Speaker 3>sold in this fucking shitty smack,</v>

1953
01:34:38.650 --> 01:34:40.510
<v Speaker 3>but when he fletcher,</v>

<v Speaker 3>d's on these fucking pills.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't hear anybody being like,</v>

1955
01:34:43.571 --> 01:34:48.571
<v Speaker 3>we're going to find the pharmacists that</v>
<v Speaker 3>gave heath ledger this combination of </v>

1956
01:34:48.571 --> 01:34:49.600
<v Speaker 3>fucking pills and we're going to take </v>
<v Speaker 3>this son of a bitch down.</v>

1957
01:34:49.601 --> 01:34:50.260
<v Speaker 3>It's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow.</v>

1958
01:34:50.280 --> 01:34:55.280
<v Speaker 3>It was pills.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's heath ledger's thought that's </v>

1959
01:34:55.280 --> 01:34:56.350
<v Speaker 3>not the pharmacist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but.</v>

1960
01:34:56.410 --> 01:34:57.590
<v Speaker 3>So does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Very good point.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just very,</v>

1962
01:34:58.911 --> 01:35:00.370
<v Speaker 3>very good to take you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1963
01:35:00.380 --> 01:35:03.980
<v Speaker 3>let's acknowledge the fact that if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>are dealing drugs,</v>

1964
01:35:04.160 --> 01:35:07.820
<v Speaker 3>you're a drug dealer and whatever the </v>
<v Speaker 3>drug is that you're dealing,</v>

1965
01:35:08.170 --> 01:35:13.170
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's sanctioned by the state or </v>

1966
01:35:13.170 --> 01:35:13.370
<v Speaker 3>not sanctioned by the state,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever that drug is,</v>

1967
01:35:13.371 --> 01:35:13.790
<v Speaker 3>that you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1968
01:35:13.791 --> 01:35:14.850
<v Speaker 3>dealing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1969
01:35:15.160 --> 01:35:19.010
<v Speaker 3>it is the decision of the person who </v>
<v Speaker 3>buys it from you to take it.</v>

1970
01:35:19.190 --> 01:35:22.280
<v Speaker 3>It is their own freewill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is human autonomy.</v>

1971
01:35:22.370 --> 01:35:26.450
<v Speaker 3>If you decide to take a substance that </v>
<v Speaker 3>is your right as a human,</v>

1972
01:35:26.451 --> 01:35:30.200
<v Speaker 3>no matter what the fuck it is from God </v>
<v Speaker 3>damn heroin to marijuana,</v>

1973
01:35:30.201 --> 01:35:35.201
<v Speaker 3>to alcohol,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your right as a human being on this </v>

1974
01:35:35.201 --> 01:35:35.390
<v Speaker 3>planet is to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as much as you want,</v>

1975
01:35:35.391 --> 01:35:40.391
<v Speaker 3>alter or transform your particular </v>
<v Speaker 3>chemical states or psychological states </v>

1976
01:35:40.551 --> 01:35:45.530
<v Speaker 3>or mood states even if it ends up </v>
<v Speaker 3>killing you,</v>

1977
01:35:45.890 --> 01:35:49.280
<v Speaker 3>but your but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but under the effects of those things,</v>

1978
01:35:49.490 --> 01:35:52.520
<v Speaker 3>you're not allowed to hurt other people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not allowed to do fucked up shit.</v>

1979
01:35:52.521 --> 01:35:57.521
<v Speaker 3>And if you do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those are the laws and the crimes that </v>

1980
01:35:57.521 --> 01:35:57.521
<v Speaker 3>you should be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How the candidates,</v>

1981
01:35:57.521 --> 01:36:01.000
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for Hunter Thompson had a set of rules </v>

1982
01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:04.220
<v Speaker 5>that he was trying to establish when he </v>
<v Speaker 5>was running for mayor of Aspen in the 19</v>

1983
01:36:04.221 --> 01:36:07.460
<v Speaker 5>seventies and one of the things was he </v>
<v Speaker 5>was going to have stock hades.</v>

1984
01:36:07.940 --> 01:36:10.790
<v Speaker 5>He was gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was gonna sign up to all the streets,</v>

1985
01:36:10.791 --> 01:36:12.500
<v Speaker 5>like chew up all the concrete,</v>
<v Speaker 5>saw the streets,</v>

1986
01:36:12.680 --> 01:36:17.680
<v Speaker 5>and he was going to have stock that he </v>
<v Speaker 5>would put drug dealers so that he said </v>

1987
01:36:17.991 --> 01:36:22.991
<v Speaker 5>that any drug worth taking you should </v>
<v Speaker 5>never buy or sell of rule four rule is </v>

1988
01:36:26.361 --> 01:36:31.361
<v Speaker 5>what we going to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What he was going to do was he was </v>

1989
01:36:31.361 --> 01:36:31.590
<v Speaker 5>gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well obviously it wasn't really going to</v>

1990
01:36:31.600 --> 01:36:32.840
<v Speaker 5>do that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean it was pros,</v>

1991
01:36:32.990 --> 01:36:37.990
<v Speaker 5>but he was saying that he was going to </v>
<v Speaker 5>have stock hades in front of the </v>

1992
01:36:37.990 --> 01:36:39.260
<v Speaker 5>statehouse where he would,</v>
<v Speaker 5>or front of the building,</v>

1993
01:36:39.290 --> 01:36:40.940
<v Speaker 5>whatever it would be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

1994
01:36:41.890 --> 01:36:43.340
<v Speaker 3>He's great man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Great.</v>

1995
01:36:43.600 --> 01:36:44.950
<v Speaker 3>What is his.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's got another quote.</v>

1996
01:36:44.951 --> 01:36:46.330
<v Speaker 3>I just read what I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love.</v>

1997
01:36:46.331 --> 01:36:48.520
<v Speaker 3>Which is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't find lsd.</v>

1998
01:36:48.521 --> 01:36:51.280
<v Speaker 3>LSD finds you when you're ready.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's true.</v>

1999
01:36:51.460 --> 01:36:52.140
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty cool,</v>

2000
01:36:52.160 --> 01:36:53.330
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't believe that.</v>

2001
01:36:53.331 --> 01:36:55.700
<v Speaker 5>I believe that with all psychedelics.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I really do.</v>

2002
01:36:55.790 --> 01:36:58.700
<v Speaker 5>It sounds so stupid when you say it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like you believe it,</v>

2003
01:36:58.710 --> 01:37:03.710
<v Speaker 5>bro.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You believe it was a plan for </v>

2004
01:37:03.710 --> 01:37:05.711
<v Speaker 5>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't matter if I believe or don't </v>

2005
01:37:05.711 --> 01:37:05.711
<v Speaker 5>believe because I really would never </v>
<v Speaker 5>know if it's true,</v>

2006
01:37:05.711 --> 01:37:07.910
<v Speaker 5>but it's fun to believe it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so therefore I believe it.</v>

2007
01:37:08.210 --> 01:37:13.210
<v Speaker 5>I don't really think that the Hulk Bruce</v>
<v Speaker 5>Banner becomes the hulk and leaps </v>

2008
01:37:13.210 --> 01:37:13.700
<v Speaker 5>through the air and smashes the </v>
<v Speaker 5>airplanes,</v>

2009
01:37:13.910 --> 01:37:18.910
<v Speaker 5>but it's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's fun to watch it and while it's </v>

2010
01:37:18.910 --> 01:37:18.910
<v Speaker 5>happening I try to pretend like it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>really happened,</v>

2011
01:37:19.190 --> 01:37:19.610
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

2012
01:37:20.110 --> 01:37:22.330
<v Speaker 3>Damn right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a problematic.</v>

2013
01:37:22.350 --> 01:37:27.350
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think a lot of skeptics and cynics </v>

2014
01:37:27.350 --> 01:37:30.151
<v Speaker 3>does sound on fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't understand that it's that </v>

2015
01:37:30.151 --> 01:37:32.730
<v Speaker 3>like they were.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe that I can choose whatever </v>

2016
01:37:32.730 --> 01:37:33.970
<v Speaker 3>lens I want to use to look through the </v>
<v Speaker 3>universe.</v>

2017
01:37:34.010 --> 01:37:39.010
<v Speaker 5>They're super important to men because </v>
<v Speaker 5>they dispelled bullshit and then the </v>

2018
01:37:39.010 --> 01:37:42.620
<v Speaker 5>comforter,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the comfort that you have in balancing </v>

2019
01:37:42.620 --> 01:37:42.830
<v Speaker 5>on the ledge of truth and fantasy and </v>
<v Speaker 5>fun,</v>

2020
01:37:43.110 --> 01:37:46.580
<v Speaker 5>and some people do not have that comfort</v>
<v Speaker 5>on that ledge and for them,</v>

2021
01:37:46.581 --> 01:37:50.870
<v Speaker 5>skeptics are hugely important because </v>
<v Speaker 5>they can disprove a lot of the shit that</v>

2022
01:37:50.871 --> 01:37:55.871
<v Speaker 5>other folks can't see.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everybody has different vision when it </v>

2023
01:37:55.871 --> 01:37:56.400
<v Speaker 5>comes to their ability to perceive </v>
<v Speaker 5>things and some are born shortsighted,</v>

2024
01:37:56.610 --> 01:38:01.610
<v Speaker 1>but we're supposed to pretend that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>brain is 100 percent equal across the </v>

2025
01:38:01.610 --> 01:38:03.480
<v Speaker 1>board and everyone can see all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bullshit that everyone else can see.</v>

2026
01:38:03.800 --> 01:38:05.100
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not always the case.</v>

2027
01:38:05.340 --> 01:38:10.340
<v Speaker 1>There's some people that just don't have</v>
<v Speaker 1>good sight and they don't have good </v>

2028
01:38:10.340 --> 01:38:12.570
<v Speaker 1>clarity there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just don't and they need help.</v>

2029
01:38:13.230 --> 01:38:13.830
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2030
01:38:13.831 --> 01:38:15.210
<v Speaker 1>they do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're right,</v>

2031
01:38:15.450 --> 01:38:17.550
<v Speaker 1>but those people aren't gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Listen to a fucking skeptic.</v>

2032
01:38:17.551 --> 01:38:19.560
<v Speaker 1>I mean data.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they need a little,</v>

2033
01:38:19.890 --> 01:38:21.520
<v Speaker 1>some of them will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

2034
01:38:21.590 --> 01:38:23.760
<v Speaker 1>there's a spectrum of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

2035
01:38:23.790 --> 01:38:26.430
<v Speaker 1>but I do think you are as a skeptic in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same way,</v>

2036
01:38:26.431 --> 01:38:31.431
<v Speaker 1>like I will fully admit that many </v>
<v Speaker 1>fantasies that I have many ideas that I </v>

2037
01:38:31.431 --> 01:38:36.351
<v Speaker 1>have a completely unprovable and more </v>
<v Speaker 1>than likely horse shit,</v>

2038
01:38:37.370 --> 01:38:40.380
<v Speaker 1>but they're so fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're so fun.</v>

2039
01:38:40.381 --> 01:38:43.980
<v Speaker 1>But here's another thing that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>important to acknowledge is that some of</v>

2040
01:38:43.981 --> 01:38:46.260
<v Speaker 1>the lenses that you look through the </v>
<v Speaker 1>universe through,</v>

2041
01:38:46.620 --> 01:38:51.480
<v Speaker 1>even if the symbols that are within </v>
<v Speaker 1>those lenses are completely ridiculous,</v>

2042
01:38:51.481 --> 01:38:54.600
<v Speaker 1>like the symbol of Jesus rising from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>dead,</v>

2043
01:38:54.601 --> 01:38:58.800
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the symbol of a ganache or the symbol</v>

2044
01:38:58.801 --> 01:38:59.520
<v Speaker 1>of Honamin.</v>

2045
01:38:59.850 --> 01:39:04.850
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though the symbols themselves are </v>

2046
01:39:04.850 --> 01:39:07.850
<v Speaker 1>clearly a fantasy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the effect of gazing through those </v>

2047
01:39:07.850 --> 01:39:12.681
<v Speaker 1>lenses and the effect that it has on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>decisions that you make quite often can </v>

2048
01:39:12.681 --> 01:39:15.660
<v Speaker 1>be really profound.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is that instead of making selfish,</v>

2049
01:39:15.661 --> 01:39:17.430
<v Speaker 1>stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>angry decisions,</v>

2050
01:39:17.640 --> 01:39:22.640
<v Speaker 1>you might start making more positive </v>
<v Speaker 1>decisions because you've connected with </v>

2051
01:39:22.640 --> 01:39:26.511
<v Speaker 1>this architect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>archetypical God of friendship and </v>

2052
01:39:26.511 --> 01:39:27.020
<v Speaker 1>devotion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is who Honamin as you know,</v>

2053
01:39:27.120 --> 01:39:32.120
<v Speaker 1>Hanuman's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This monkey God that represents like </v>

2054
01:39:32.120 --> 01:39:35.010
<v Speaker 1>pure devotion or service and friendship </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the deepest,</v>

2055
01:39:35.370 --> 01:39:38.100
<v Speaker 1>sweetest level to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's beautiful,</v>

2056
01:39:38.101 --> 01:39:43.101
<v Speaker 1>it's beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so I can use that symbol if I want </v>

2057
01:39:43.101 --> 01:39:43.101
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2058
01:39:43.101 --> 01:39:46.730
<v Speaker 1>when I'm thinking about loyalty or when </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking about like giving up my </v>

2059
01:39:47.851 --> 01:39:52.680
<v Speaker 1>life for another person's life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I think about like giving myself to</v>

2060
01:39:52.681 --> 01:39:57.681
<v Speaker 1>another person with nothing really to </v>
<v Speaker 1>gain other than giving myself to that </v>

2061
01:39:57.681 --> 01:39:58.050
<v Speaker 1>person and helping them as I can.</v>

2062
01:39:58.170 --> 01:39:59.760
<v Speaker 1>It's a great symbol.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It works.</v>

2063
01:39:59.910 --> 01:40:02.310
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't have to be fucking real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do I believe in a monkey?</v>

2064
01:40:02.311 --> 01:40:05.610
<v Speaker 1>God that flies through the sky?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do I believe in that?</v>

2065
01:40:05.850 --> 01:40:07.770
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that symbols would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can be,</v>

2066
01:40:07.830 --> 01:40:12.830
<v Speaker 1>is almost like dedicated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dedicated thoughts that you can cling </v>

2067
01:40:13.471 --> 01:40:18.471
<v Speaker 1>onto if you're trying to explain this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're moving through a sea of being </v>

2068
01:40:21.421 --> 01:40:23.010
<v Speaker 1>a person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the variables,</v>

2069
01:40:23.011 --> 01:40:26.470
<v Speaker 1>all the negatives and positives and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2070
01:40:26.480 --> 01:40:26.770
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2071
01:40:26.771 --> 01:40:31.771
<v Speaker 1>the changing of the tide,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of your emotions and your happiness and </v>

2072
01:40:31.771 --> 01:40:31.771
<v Speaker 1>your discontent and your depression </v>
<v Speaker 1>will.</v>

2073
01:40:31.771 --> 01:40:36.090
<v Speaker 1>But you could have these islands that in</v>
<v Speaker 1>this float you could cling to and one of</v>

2074
01:40:36.091 --> 01:40:37.670
<v Speaker 1>them might be the Buddha.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2075
01:40:37.671 --> 01:40:39.990
<v Speaker 1>And when you see the Buddha,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think of enlightenment.</v>

2076
01:40:39.991 --> 01:40:44.991
<v Speaker 1>You think of yourself at peace and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>can somehow or another imbibe you imbibe</v>

2077
01:40:45.411 --> 01:40:47.310
<v Speaker 1>view with this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

2078
01:40:47.790 --> 01:40:52.110
<v Speaker 1>this cap encapsulization of like you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2079
01:40:52.111 --> 01:40:54.190
<v Speaker 1>you're at least your imaginary</v>

2080
01:40:54.190 --> 01:40:56.500
<v Speaker 6>idea of what it's like to be </v>
<v Speaker 6>enlightened.</v>

2081
01:40:56.501 --> 01:40:57.640
<v Speaker 6>Damn right,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you clean,</v>

2082
01:40:57.670 --> 01:41:00.100
<v Speaker 6>you clean to that and that I can maybe </v>
<v Speaker 6>guide you a little.</v>

2083
01:41:00.101 --> 01:41:05.101
<v Speaker 6>You could hold onto that and it'll carry</v>
<v Speaker 6>you down and maybe from there you can </v>

2084
01:41:05.101 --> 01:41:08.641
<v Speaker 6>get to dry land.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Maybe from there you can get to the </v>

2085
01:41:08.641 --> 01:41:08.641
<v Speaker 6>island of new ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but these,</v>

2086
01:41:08.641 --> 01:41:10.890
<v Speaker 6>these archetypal things that you claim </v>
<v Speaker 6>to these,</v>

2087
01:41:10.891 --> 01:41:13.030
<v Speaker 6>these images,</v>
<v Speaker 6>whatever they may be,</v>

2088
01:41:13.060 --> 01:41:18.060
<v Speaker 6>the reason why they've existed </v>
<v Speaker 6>throughout history as that people have </v>

2089
01:41:18.060 --> 01:41:20.641
<v Speaker 6>found value in their memories and </v>
<v Speaker 6>connecting thoughts and principles and </v>

2090
01:41:20.641 --> 01:41:23.140
<v Speaker 6>ideas to these symbols and that's why </v>
<v Speaker 6>they defend them so hard.</v>

2091
01:41:23.141 --> 01:41:25.030
<v Speaker 6>That's why people want to kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you draw Muhammad,</v>

2092
01:41:25.240 --> 01:41:27.270
<v Speaker 6>if you fuck up their idea of their </v>
<v Speaker 6>symbol,</v>

2093
01:41:27.530 --> 01:41:30.910
<v Speaker 6>their symbol is so significant to them </v>
<v Speaker 6>that they're willing to.</v>

2094
01:41:31.220 --> 01:41:36.220
<v Speaker 6>If they're willing to lash out and </v>
<v Speaker 6>caused murder because you violated </v>

2095
01:41:36.530 --> 01:41:36.670
<v Speaker 6>their.</v>

2096
01:41:36.990 --> 01:41:39.120
<v Speaker 3>They got stuck on the assemble and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the.</v>

2097
01:41:39.250 --> 01:41:44.250
<v Speaker 3>That's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like somebody going through the </v>

2098
01:41:44.250 --> 01:41:45.630
<v Speaker 3>wilderness thinking that the campus is </v>
<v Speaker 3>the destination and it's,</v>

2099
01:41:45.660 --> 01:41:46.440
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's.</v>

2100
01:41:46.470 --> 01:41:49.800
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how anyone would be that </v>
<v Speaker 3>dumb to think that and so that's a wrong</v>

2101
01:41:49.801 --> 01:41:51.720
<v Speaker 3>way to put it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's a really.</v>

2102
01:41:51.770 --> 01:41:56.770
<v Speaker 3>It's a in the same way literally like </v>
<v Speaker 3>people who are always fighting over the </v>

2103
01:41:56.770 --> 01:41:59.130
<v Speaker 3>literal g or the historic Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2104
01:41:59.131 --> 01:42:01.500
<v Speaker 3>the people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that guy didn't even fucking exist,</v>

2105
01:42:01.620 --> 01:42:04.170
<v Speaker 3>and that people that get really caught </v>
<v Speaker 3>up and disproving Jesus,</v>

2106
01:42:04.410 --> 01:42:09.410
<v Speaker 3>they've also gotten caught up in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>surface level of that symbol and so </v>

2107
01:42:09.410 --> 01:42:10.580
<v Speaker 3>they're spending all their time trying </v>
<v Speaker 3>to prove no,</v>

2108
01:42:10.581 --> 01:42:10.950
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

2109
01:42:10.951 --> 01:42:15.951
<v Speaker 3>There's never was a historic Jesus or </v>
<v Speaker 3>the historic Jesus that existed was not </v>

2110
01:42:15.951 --> 01:42:18.870
<v Speaker 3>the Jesus in the Bible that has blah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever you want to say.</v>

2111
01:42:18.930 --> 01:42:20.780
<v Speaker 3>You're damn right you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2112
01:42:20.820 --> 01:42:23.580
<v Speaker 3>I'll buy a shirt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was no real Jesus or there was.</v>

2113
01:42:23.581 --> 01:42:28.581
<v Speaker 3>He was one of many people or who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or maybe he wasn't magical or whatever </v>

2114
01:42:28.581 --> 01:42:30.300
<v Speaker 3>on one level,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck yes,</v>

2115
01:42:30.360 --> 01:42:33.150
<v Speaker 3>you're 100 percent right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's also no Santa Claus.</v>

2116
01:42:33.360 --> 01:42:37.590
<v Speaker 3>There's no such thing as ghosts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no such thing as reincarnation,</v>

2117
01:42:37.860 --> 01:42:42.860
<v Speaker 3>we're all just a non-differentiated </v>
<v Speaker 3>aspect of a great mass of Adam's </v>

2118
01:42:44.311 --> 01:42:49.311
<v Speaker 3>currently being exploded out of an event</v>
<v Speaker 3>13 point 8 billion years ago,</v>

2119
01:42:50.340 --> 01:42:51.960
<v Speaker 3>and that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nothing else.</v>

2120
01:42:51.961 --> 01:42:55.110
<v Speaker 3>That's fucking it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's one level and it's totally real.</v>

2121
01:42:55.560 --> 01:42:57.870
<v Speaker 3>There's another level though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the problem.</v>

2122
01:42:57.871 --> 01:43:02.520
<v Speaker 3>There is a completely other level which </v>
<v Speaker 3>is that the level of the interior self,</v>

2123
01:43:02.521 --> 01:43:05.760
<v Speaker 3>the level of the subjective,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the universe did a big bang.</v>

2124
01:43:05.761 --> 01:43:08.700
<v Speaker 3>It exploded from the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It did a big bang.</v>

2125
01:43:08.790 --> 01:43:13.790
<v Speaker 3>It exploded.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did a big duty like God is a baby,</v>

2126
01:43:14.881 --> 01:43:19.881
<v Speaker 3>just accidentally shit Outta universe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it explodes out and then it ends up </v>

2127
01:43:19.881 --> 01:43:24.561
<v Speaker 3>turning into human beings and human </v>
<v Speaker 3>beings end up somehow developing this </v>

2128
01:43:24.561 --> 01:43:27.530
<v Speaker 3>incredibly advanced for frontal lobe and</v>
<v Speaker 3>the neo cortex.</v>

2129
01:43:28.110 --> 01:43:29.650
<v Speaker 3>Whenever you can throw out that word,</v>
<v Speaker 3>throw it out,</v>

2130
01:43:29.651 --> 01:43:34.651
<v Speaker 3>it makes you seem smart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Couldn't have a neocortex walked out to </v>

2131
01:43:34.651 --> 01:43:34.651
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't know what it looked like,</v>

2132
01:43:34.651 --> 01:43:35.460
<v Speaker 3>but.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when that happened,</v>

2133
01:43:35.461 --> 01:43:37.530
<v Speaker 3>we.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We gained an interior universe,</v>

2134
01:43:37.770 --> 01:43:39.930
<v Speaker 3>which is the universe of symbols,</v>
<v Speaker 3>myth,</v>

2135
01:43:39.990 --> 01:43:41.730
<v Speaker 3>dreams,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stories,</v>

2136
01:43:41.850 --> 01:43:45.180
<v Speaker 3>and that's a real part of the material </v>
<v Speaker 3>universe.</v>

2137
01:43:45.300 --> 01:43:50.300
<v Speaker 3>The material universe has a substrata,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is the universe of myth and the </v>

2138
01:43:50.300 --> 01:43:52.490
<v Speaker 3>universe of religion and the universe of</v>
<v Speaker 3>fantasy,</v>

2139
01:43:52.610 --> 01:43:54.620
<v Speaker 7>and that's another level of the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 7>thing,</v>

2140
01:43:54.800 --> 01:43:57.020
<v Speaker 7>and if you start tuning into those </v>
<v Speaker 7>symbols,</v>

2141
01:43:57.320 --> 01:44:00.740
<v Speaker 7>it doesn't matter if you're tuning into </v>
<v Speaker 7>an externalized,</v>

2142
01:44:00.770 --> 01:44:05.770
<v Speaker 7>mystical,</v>
<v Speaker 7>super entity or whether you're tuning </v>

2143
01:44:05.770 --> 01:44:09.131
<v Speaker 7>into a part of your brain that it comes </v>
<v Speaker 7>from millions of years of evolution.</v>

2144
01:44:09.801 --> 01:44:14.720
<v Speaker 7>You're still tuning into a point where </v>
<v Speaker 7>from a harmonizing with it,</v>

2145
01:44:14.900 --> 01:44:19.340
<v Speaker 7>you can experience an elevated mood </v>
<v Speaker 7>state and that elevated mood,</v>

2146
01:44:19.341 --> 01:44:21.800
<v Speaker 7>state and whatever way it manifests from</v>
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>

2147
01:44:22.160 --> 01:44:27.160
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>experience of Samadhi to the experience </v>

2148
01:44:27.160 --> 01:44:30.041
<v Speaker 7>of the passion of the Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the surrender to allowing yourself to be</v>

2149
01:44:31.341 --> 01:44:33.830
<v Speaker 7>destroyed by time and still loving it.</v>

2150
01:44:33.860 --> 01:44:38.860
<v Speaker 6>Or a yoga class or a comedy club or </v>
<v Speaker 6>being the see a concert.</v>

2151
01:44:39.320 --> 01:44:44.320
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>be you see a concert and you seeing </v>

2152
01:44:44.320 --> 01:44:46.001
<v Speaker 6>someone perform music or someone was </v>
<v Speaker 6>really good that you really appreciate </v>

2153
01:44:46.001 --> 01:44:46.730
<v Speaker 6>their art.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It moves you,</v>

2154
01:44:46.731 --> 01:44:48.440
<v Speaker 6>you're holding,</v>
<v Speaker 6>your body feels different,</v>

2155
01:44:48.441 --> 01:44:50.880
<v Speaker 6>your emotions get torn up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're like,</v>

2156
01:44:50.900 --> 01:44:55.900
<v Speaker 6>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like people will cry when they hear a </v>

2157
01:44:55.900 --> 01:44:55.900
<v Speaker 6>great song though.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There'll be moved like the like,</v>

2158
01:44:55.900 --> 01:45:00.400
<v Speaker 6>fuck yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they'll throw their hands in the air to </v>

2159
01:45:00.400 --> 01:45:00.400
<v Speaker 6>get nutty.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The body will start moving,</v>

2160
01:45:00.400 --> 01:45:04.601
<v Speaker 6>the Kinnaman help it or a mantra or a </v>
<v Speaker 6>mantra or a mantra or or or any number </v>

2161
01:45:04.701 --> 01:45:09.701
<v Speaker 6>of things that you can lock into with or</v>
<v Speaker 6>sounds or images or some thing that we </v>

2162
01:45:09.831 --> 01:45:14.540
<v Speaker 6>have encapsulated that causes us to </v>
<v Speaker 6>react in this incredible way that we can</v>

2163
01:45:14.541 --> 01:45:19.541
<v Speaker 6>replicate shot through the shoe,</v>
<v Speaker 6>gave him a bad name and everybody just </v>

2164
01:45:24.021 --> 01:45:27.500
<v Speaker 6>goes fucking crazy whether or not you </v>
<v Speaker 6>agree with Bon Jovi or not.</v>

2165
01:45:27.950 --> 01:45:31.820
<v Speaker 6>That moment where 15,000</v>
<v Speaker 6>freaks go crazy.</v>

2166
01:45:31.821 --> 01:45:33.380
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>because he sinks,</v>

2167
01:45:33.381 --> 01:45:37.100
<v Speaker 6>shot through the heart and you're to </v>
<v Speaker 6>blame and they just lose their shit.</v>

2168
01:45:37.101 --> 01:45:40.460
<v Speaker 6>They can't help but they're stomping.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're hugging each other like,</v>

2169
01:45:40.461 --> 01:45:42.110
<v Speaker 6>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're high fiving each other.</v>

2170
01:45:42.320 --> 01:45:47.320
<v Speaker 6>It's the best.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like it's undeniable that that gave </v>

2171
01:45:47.320 --> 01:45:47.320
<v Speaker 6>those 15,000</v>
<v Speaker 6>people,</v>

2172
01:45:47.320 --> 01:45:51.190
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>step out of the role of being an art </v>

2173
01:45:51.190 --> 01:45:52.310
<v Speaker 6>critic for a moment and look at what </v>
<v Speaker 6>happened to those 15,000</v>

2174
01:45:52.311 --> 01:45:53.270
<v Speaker 6>people.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>

2175
01:45:53.271 --> 01:45:54.830
<v Speaker 6>that's how I have to do with the </v>
<v Speaker 6>grateful dead.</v>

2176
01:45:55.130 --> 01:46:00.130
<v Speaker 6>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've always had to step outside of the </v>

2177
01:46:00.130 --> 01:46:00.130
<v Speaker 6>role of a music critic and just </v>
<v Speaker 6>appreciate the.</v>

2178
01:46:00.130 --> 01:46:02.300
<v Speaker 6>Some people love the fuck out of them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>

2179
01:46:02.301 --> 01:46:04.090
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm missing a gene or something.</v>

2180
01:46:04.091 --> 01:46:06.200
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you've never taken acid and listening to</v>

2181
01:46:06.201 --> 01:46:10.550
<v Speaker 6>the grateful dead.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You gotta do man,</v>

2182
01:46:10.850 --> 01:46:12.770
<v Speaker 6>take some acid and listening to the </v>
<v Speaker 6>grateful dead with me.</v>

2183
01:46:12.771 --> 01:46:17.771
<v Speaker 6>You'll understand dude.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I smoked DMT and listened to eco rose </v>

2184
01:46:17.771 --> 01:46:17.930
<v Speaker 6>with Aubrey.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>

2185
01:46:18.170 --> 01:46:23.170
<v Speaker 6>And that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know if the grateful dead and </v>

2186
01:46:23.170 --> 01:46:25.310
<v Speaker 6>acid is going to be able to fuck with </v>
<v Speaker 6>eco rose and the DMT experience.</v>

2187
01:46:25.430 --> 01:46:27.080
<v Speaker 6>You have to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>By the way.</v>

2188
01:46:27.140 --> 01:46:29.600
<v Speaker 6>I would like to try.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That is very different.</v>

2189
01:46:29.601 --> 01:46:32.200
<v Speaker 6>The ECO rose thing is very different.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is what</v>

2190
01:46:32.240 --> 01:46:36.860
<v Speaker 7>mechanic was saying that these Shamans,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they sing for things into form.</v>

2191
01:46:36.890 --> 01:46:40.160
<v Speaker 7>They did.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You see like a visual representation.</v>

2192
01:46:40.290 --> 01:46:43.590
<v Speaker 6>It's perfectly sinked.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're one in the same.</v>

2193
01:46:43.591 --> 01:46:47.430
<v Speaker 6>There are two different things that go </v>
<v Speaker 6>together and buy their own on their own.</v>

2194
01:46:47.431 --> 01:46:49.350
<v Speaker 6>They're are magical.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean on own.</v>

2195
01:46:49.380 --> 01:46:50.040
<v Speaker 6>Did the ECO</v>

2196
01:46:50.050 --> 01:46:55.050
<v Speaker 4>sound fucking amazing?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I listened to them on my way home from </v>

2197
01:46:55.050 --> 01:46:56.040
<v Speaker 4>gigs when I want to see what I want to </v>
<v Speaker 4>think about things,</v>

2198
01:46:56.041 --> 01:47:01.041
<v Speaker 4>but I also want to hear something </v>
<v Speaker 4>because I don't know what the fuck </v>

2199
01:47:01.041 --> 01:47:01.041
<v Speaker 4>they're saying so because I don't know </v>
<v Speaker 4>what they're saying.</v>

2200
01:47:01.041 --> 01:47:03.630
<v Speaker 4>I can enjoy it without being attached to</v>
<v Speaker 4>the words.</v>

2201
01:47:03.631 --> 01:47:05.040
<v Speaker 4>They're just a bunch of noises.</v>
<v Speaker 4>To me,</v>

2202
01:47:05.041 --> 01:47:10.041
<v Speaker 4>the cool noises and I know guys and only</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I know that word Iowasca I have.</v>

2203
01:47:11.010 --> 01:47:13.870
<v Speaker 4>I've got a guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's really we.</v>

2204
01:47:13.871 --> 01:47:15.540
<v Speaker 4>It sounds like a little kid singing </v>
<v Speaker 4>kind.</v>

2205
01:47:15.570 --> 01:47:19.200
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't act like a little kid and the</v>
<v Speaker 4>forest would just be singing that song.</v>

2206
01:47:19.230 --> 01:47:20.610
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of them that are like </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

2207
01:47:20.611 --> 01:47:25.611
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of them that are really </v>

2208
01:47:25.611 --> 01:47:25.611
<v Speaker 4>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What is that?</v>

2209
01:47:25.611 --> 01:47:26.020
<v Speaker 4>Is that blowing the smoke?</v>

2210
01:47:26.240 --> 01:47:26.440
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

2211
01:47:30.410 --> 01:47:33.290
<v Speaker 9>I listen to this one.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I whistle this one.</v>

2212
01:47:33.320 --> 01:47:36.410
<v Speaker 9>I find myself like whistling it through </v>
<v Speaker 9>the day and the other day</v>

2213
01:47:39.560 --> 01:47:42.750
<v Speaker 9>I was whistling at the comedy store and </v>
<v Speaker 9>one of the dudes who works there started</v>

2214
01:47:42.751 --> 01:47:44.520
<v Speaker 9>whistling on.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It was weird.</v>

2215
01:47:44.970 --> 01:47:45.900
<v Speaker 9>He knew it.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Nope.</v>

2216
01:47:46.670 --> 01:47:47.550
<v Speaker 9>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 9>What?</v>

2217
01:47:47.551 --> 01:47:49.870
<v Speaker 9>I was doing it so much.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I was doing it so much,</v>

2218
01:47:49.980 --> 01:47:54.900
<v Speaker 9>it sort of snuck into them,</v>
<v Speaker 9>so the idea behind it,</v>

2219
01:47:54.901 --> 01:47:59.901
<v Speaker 9>according to the Shaman is that the </v>
<v Speaker 9>plants give them their salt and that as </v>

2220
01:48:01.351 --> 01:48:06.351
<v Speaker 9>they're cooking up,</v>
<v Speaker 9>the IOWASCA did learn the song and they </v>

2221
01:48:06.351 --> 01:48:09.270
<v Speaker 9>figured out through this relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 9>this pure relationship that they have to</v>

2222
01:48:09.271 --> 01:48:14.150
<v Speaker 9>the madre because they're a real sharp </v>
<v Speaker 9>and over the,</v>

2223
01:48:14.570 --> 01:48:16.860
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 9>thousands of years of them doing this.</v>

2224
01:48:17.220 --> 01:48:22.220
<v Speaker 9>They found some songs and when you,</v>
<v Speaker 9>when you experienced dmt under the spell</v>

2225
01:48:22.591 --> 01:48:27.591
<v Speaker 9>of the songs is a very,</v>
<v Speaker 9>very strange experience because they,</v>

2226
01:48:27.690 --> 01:48:30.840
<v Speaker 9>they belong together.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's like when you're hearing this,</v>

2227
01:48:31.080 --> 01:48:33.210
<v Speaker 9>every time it changes and there's a </v>
<v Speaker 9>whistle,</v>

2228
01:48:33.750 --> 01:48:37.960
<v Speaker 9>a new chapter,</v>
<v Speaker 9>we'll start a new geometric pattern will</v>

2229
01:48:37.990 --> 01:48:40.950
<v Speaker 9>explode into something completely </v>
<v Speaker 9>different and dance around you</v>

2230
01:48:42.740 --> 01:48:45.890
<v Speaker 4>and there's like a whole series that you</v>
<v Speaker 4>listened to when you're on a trip,</v>

2231
01:48:46.220 --> 01:48:51.220
<v Speaker 4>you start off with one sort of an </v>
<v Speaker 4>introductory one and you move into the </v>

2232
01:48:51.220 --> 01:48:54.251
<v Speaker 4>other one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And as it goes deeper and deeper and </v>

2233
01:48:54.251 --> 01:48:56.591
<v Speaker 4>deeper that the experience changes and </v>
<v Speaker 4>becomes this like really crazy complex </v>

2234
01:48:59.210 --> 01:49:02.440
<v Speaker 4>geometrical life form that's all </v>
<v Speaker 4>encompassing.</v>

2235
01:49:02.441 --> 01:49:05.210
<v Speaker 4>It's everything that's all around you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's beautiful.</v>

2236
01:49:05.330 --> 01:49:06.520
<v Speaker 4>It's very strange,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dude.</v>

2237
01:49:06.770 --> 01:49:08.690
<v Speaker 4>That gets in the background.</v>

2238
01:49:10.530 --> 01:49:12.150
<v Speaker 9>That's legit as fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 9>man.</v>

2239
01:49:12.520 --> 01:49:17.520
<v Speaker 9>This is all recorded during a ceremony,</v>
<v Speaker 9>so this is not just happening like with </v>

2240
01:49:19.401 --> 01:49:24.401
<v Speaker 9>the guy singing happening,</v>
<v Speaker 9>there's a guy singing with a group of </v>

2241
01:49:24.401 --> 01:49:27.761
<v Speaker 9>people tripping the fucking balls off </v>
<v Speaker 9>and he's guiding them and while this is </v>

2242
01:49:32.251 --> 01:49:37.251
<v Speaker 9>going on,</v>
<v Speaker 9>like it dances all around you and sues </v>

2243
01:49:37.251 --> 01:49:40.610
<v Speaker 9>you and Tom to you and explained to you,</v>
<v Speaker 9>do you know what even trippier about </v>

2244
01:49:40.610 --> 01:49:40.890
<v Speaker 9>this</v>

2245
01:49:41.890 --> 01:49:45.950
<v Speaker 4>is that that night when you ever was </v>
<v Speaker 4>lived near this shrimping,</v>

2246
01:49:45.951 --> 01:49:47.150
<v Speaker 4>they're fucking brains.</v>

2247
01:49:48.070 --> 01:49:49.630
<v Speaker 1>I bet somebody thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2248
01:49:49.631 --> 01:49:53.530
<v Speaker 1>why do I feel like this is gonna get </v>
<v Speaker 1>transmitted to 10 million people?</v>

2249
01:49:54.610 --> 01:49:59.610
<v Speaker 1>How weird is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How weird is it that that's a very </v>

2250
01:49:59.610 --> 01:49:59.620
<v Speaker 1>strange thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what technology does because here</v>

2251
01:49:59.621 --> 01:50:04.550
<v Speaker 1>you consider this incredible night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God knows where that was probably where.</v>

2252
01:50:04.580 --> 01:50:06.580
<v Speaker 1>Where do you think that was recorded?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who the fuck knows?</v>

2253
01:50:06.620 --> 01:50:09.130
<v Speaker 1>Somewhere I'll have an experiment that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to do what?</v>

2254
01:50:09.160 --> 01:50:12.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to have crash rig my tank up </v>
<v Speaker 1>with speakers.</v>

2255
01:50:12.280 --> 01:50:15.490
<v Speaker 1>I want to listen to that in the tank </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I think if I listened to that in</v>

2256
01:50:15.491 --> 01:50:20.491
<v Speaker 1>a tank enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think if I put that on loop for like </v>

2257
01:50:20.491 --> 01:50:21.250
<v Speaker 1>an hour,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I could trip my balls off.</v>

2258
01:50:21.280 --> 01:50:23.230
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm going to try that experiment</v>
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

2259
01:50:23.580 --> 01:50:25.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well you have a tank.</v>

2260
01:50:25.451 --> 01:50:28.190
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you fucking fucking tag now.</v>

2261
01:50:28.191 --> 01:50:31.210
<v Speaker 1>I got his intent now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so cool.</v>

2262
01:50:31.320 --> 01:50:32.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a zen 10.</v>

2263
01:50:32.830 --> 01:50:35.560
<v Speaker 1>Explained to me the situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's in a bedroom.</v>

2264
01:50:36.130 --> 01:50:36.580
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2265
01:50:36.581 --> 01:50:39.340
<v Speaker 1>What it is is because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a Cemati tanker,</v>

2266
01:50:39.460 --> 01:50:40.930
<v Speaker 1>any of the crashes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tanks,</v>

2267
01:50:40.931 --> 01:50:44.700
<v Speaker 1>they're fucking crazy giant things and </v>
<v Speaker 1>take a while to sell.</v>

2268
01:50:44.710 --> 01:50:45.820
<v Speaker 1>They're expensive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2269
01:50:46.210 --> 01:50:51.210
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is just like a essentially like a </v>

2270
01:50:51.210 --> 01:50:52.390
<v Speaker 1>reversed waterbed I guess you'd say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's a,</v>

2271
01:50:53.450 --> 01:50:55.030
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a tent.</v>

2272
01:50:55.300 --> 01:50:59.080
<v Speaker 1>A that how many gallons of water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know the exact gallons,</v>

2273
01:50:59.081 --> 01:51:04.081
<v Speaker 1>but it's big enough to float and fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like because I floated out in Austin at </v>

2274
01:51:04.081 --> 01:51:05.500
<v Speaker 1>the Float Institute and the upload is </v>
<v Speaker 1>amazing.</v>

2275
01:51:05.560 --> 01:51:10.560
<v Speaker 1>Amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The presses right up there with crashes </v>

2276
01:51:10.560 --> 01:51:10.560
<v Speaker 1>place and if you done crashes place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't done that yet.</v>

2277
01:51:10.560 --> 01:51:14.770
<v Speaker 1>Crashes the grandmaster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this guy who's got the tank place in</v>

2278
01:51:15.300 --> 01:51:16.360
<v Speaker 1>Austin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2279
01:51:16.390 --> 01:51:17.230
<v Speaker 1>Kevin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's it called?</v>

2280
01:51:17.440 --> 01:51:22.440
<v Speaker 1>Float Float Institute Institute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got his things are built like </v>

2281
01:51:22.440 --> 01:51:25.200
<v Speaker 1>boats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the hub of a boat trailer.</v>

2282
01:51:25.280 --> 01:51:26.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those things are super durable.</v>

2283
01:51:26.831 --> 01:51:31.831
<v Speaker 1>They don't even know liner there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're fucking cool man are super high </v>

2284
01:51:31.831 --> 01:51:31.831
<v Speaker 1>tech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Super High Tech.</v>

2285
01:51:31.831 --> 01:51:32.500
<v Speaker 1>But the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2286
01:51:32.501 --> 01:51:37.501
<v Speaker 1>the essence of the thing is you've got a</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit ton of salt and water and you only </v>

2287
01:51:40.241 --> 01:51:42.040
<v Speaker 1>need a certain amount of room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2288
01:51:42.041 --> 01:51:44.530
<v Speaker 1>based on like the average size of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>human being.</v>

2289
01:51:44.740 --> 01:51:46.600
<v Speaker 1>Plenty of room in the damn things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

2290
01:51:46.601 --> 01:51:51.601
<v Speaker 1>I just uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I didn't realize how much I would </v>

2291
01:51:51.941 --> 01:51:55.530
<v Speaker 1>enjoy having a float tank in my house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it.</v>

2292
01:51:55.600 --> 01:52:00.600
<v Speaker 1>I had no idea that it would be that </v>
<v Speaker 1>important to me.</v>

2293
01:52:01.151 --> 01:52:03.370
<v Speaker 1>I've only had it for a few days and </v>
<v Speaker 1>weeks lived with me.</v>

2294
01:52:03.371 --> 01:52:06.310
<v Speaker 1>You use it all the time and I forget </v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

2295
01:52:06.311 --> 01:52:07.900
<v Speaker 1>But.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was awesome to have access,</v>

2296
01:52:07.901 --> 01:52:10.390
<v Speaker 1>but I was so brokenhearted and crazy </v>
<v Speaker 1>back then.</v>

2297
01:52:10.830 --> 01:52:13.300
<v Speaker 1>Like now it's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2298
01:52:13.301 --> 01:52:16.270
<v Speaker 1>I've been working out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll go workout at the gym,</v>

2299
01:52:16.600 --> 01:52:20.320
<v Speaker 1>come back to the house with sore muscles</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you're just,</v>

2300
01:52:20.710 --> 01:52:25.710
<v Speaker 1>regardless of all the mystical shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're floating in 650 pounds of epsom </v>

2301
01:52:25.710 --> 01:52:28.210
<v Speaker 1>salt with sore muscles and that feels </v>
<v Speaker 1>damn good.</v>

2302
01:52:28.350 --> 01:52:30.760
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it feels like you're charging batteries.</v>

2303
01:52:30.880 --> 01:52:34.390
<v Speaker 1>It's really amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you walk out of the thing every time</v>

2304
01:52:34.391 --> 01:52:39.391
<v Speaker 1>so far,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I've done 30 minute floats up to </v>

2305
01:52:39.391 --> 01:52:39.790
<v Speaker 1>like an hour and a half so far.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every time you get out of the thing,</v>

2306
01:52:39.791 --> 01:52:44.791
<v Speaker 1>it's exactly like the next day after a </v>
<v Speaker 1>great mushroom trip where colors are </v>

2307
01:52:44.791 --> 01:52:46.190
<v Speaker 1>brighter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just rested.</v>

2308
01:52:46.520 --> 01:52:47.720
<v Speaker 1>It's super cool,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2309
01:52:47.770 --> 01:52:49.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm super.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't.</v>

2310
01:52:49.600 --> 01:52:51.740
<v Speaker 1>I'm so and I haven't even gotten to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>point of like,</v>

2311
01:52:51.741 --> 01:52:56.741
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens if I take a microdose of </v>

2312
01:52:56.741 --> 01:52:57.820
<v Speaker 1>some psychoactive in this thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't even gotten there yet.</v>

2313
01:52:57.920 --> 01:52:58.910
<v Speaker 1>You do that though,</v>

2314
01:53:01.410 --> 01:53:03.090
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Way To respond to that question.</v>

2315
01:53:03.460 --> 01:53:05.590
<v Speaker 6>My favorite is eating pot.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If I,</v>

2316
01:53:05.591 --> 01:53:07.900
<v Speaker 6>if I ever ate too much pot and I was </v>
<v Speaker 6>sitting around the house,</v>

2317
01:53:07.901 --> 01:53:09.640
<v Speaker 6>I jumped in and right immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't want to waste it.</v>

2318
01:53:10.890 --> 01:53:11.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2319
01:53:12.180 --> 01:53:13.390
<v Speaker 1>That's what I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess that's a.</v>

2320
01:53:13.410 --> 01:53:15.070
<v Speaker 1>of course I've been eating pot and going</v>
<v Speaker 1>into.</v>

2321
01:53:15.080 --> 01:53:18.030
<v Speaker 1>Of course I'm always eating pot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Said the other day on stage,</v>

2322
01:53:18.700 --> 01:53:21.510
<v Speaker 1>but when you brought me up on stage and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the night of the ice house,</v>

2323
01:53:21.710 --> 01:53:26.710
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Duncan is the only guy that will tell </v>

2324
01:53:26.710 --> 01:53:26.710
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2325
01:53:26.710 --> 01:53:26.710
<v Speaker 1>I got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I fucking did acid.</v>

2326
01:53:26.710 --> 01:53:26.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I did.</v>

2327
01:53:26.710 --> 01:53:29.070
<v Speaker 1>Emma will do mtms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did ecstasy.</v>

2328
01:53:29.071 --> 01:53:30.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm not doing that anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2329
01:53:30.481 --> 01:53:32.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't did anything for awhile.</v>

2330
01:53:32.490 --> 01:53:34.260
<v Speaker 1>She's eating weed everyday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

2331
01:53:34.560 --> 01:53:39.560
<v Speaker 1>Like basically fucking almost sober.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I consider that.</v>

2332
01:53:40.500 --> 01:53:43.470
<v Speaker 1>I know this is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is gonna seem like denial.</v>

2333
01:53:43.471 --> 01:53:45.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For those addicts out there.</v>

2334
01:53:45.361 --> 01:53:48.600
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I'm in denial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to me it does feel like coffee.</v>

2335
01:53:48.601 --> 01:53:53.601
<v Speaker 1>Like I place it in the same place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I put coffee so it's not really to me </v>

2336
01:53:53.601 --> 01:53:55.120
<v Speaker 1>like it does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like something that I,</v>

2337
01:53:55.160 --> 01:53:58.800
<v Speaker 1>I don't find to be destructive to my </v>
<v Speaker 1>life at all.</v>

2338
01:53:58.801 --> 01:54:03.670
<v Speaker 1>I think alcohol was the monster and </v>
<v Speaker 1>marijuana seems to just be a kind of,</v>

2339
01:54:04.070 --> 01:54:06.860
<v Speaker 6>well I'll do it one better.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I worshiped coffee,</v>

2340
01:54:07.170 --> 01:54:08.290
<v Speaker 6>right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Worship bit.</v>

2341
01:54:08.390 --> 01:54:13.390
<v Speaker 6>Coffee is a ritual.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I have a ritual when I write and I have </v>

2342
01:54:13.390 --> 01:54:14.570
<v Speaker 6>a ritual when I do podcasts and one of </v>
<v Speaker 6>my.</v>

2343
01:54:14.740 --> 01:54:17.300
<v Speaker 6>One of the big parts of my ritual is </v>
<v Speaker 6>coffee,</v>

2344
01:54:17.420 --> 01:54:20.330
<v Speaker 6>not like a monster energy drink.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

2345
01:54:20.331 --> 01:54:21.700
<v Speaker 6>I don't have anything wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't.</v>

2346
01:54:21.800 --> 01:54:23.810
<v Speaker 6>Not like red bowls.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're fine.</v>

2347
01:54:23.840 --> 01:54:26.040
<v Speaker 6>If you just need a pick me up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'll drink wine.</v>

2348
01:54:26.600 --> 01:54:28.730
<v Speaker 6>If I'm at the store and I know I'm tired</v>
<v Speaker 6>and I have to drive home,</v>

2349
01:54:28.731 --> 01:54:32.030
<v Speaker 6>I'll take a red bull,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but a coffee is like a ritual.</v>

2350
01:54:32.120 --> 01:54:35.080
<v Speaker 6>I adore coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I really do like,</v>

2351
01:54:35.081 --> 01:54:40.081
<v Speaker 6>I love to get like a nice warm cup of </v>
<v Speaker 6>coffee and then I started writing and I </v>

2352
01:54:40.081 --> 01:54:41.450
<v Speaker 6>do what I do.</v>
<v Speaker 6>A podcast like for me,</v>

2353
01:54:41.451 --> 01:54:45.050
<v Speaker 6>the podcast doesn't seem like it starts </v>
<v Speaker 6>until I'd take a sip of coffee.</v>

2354
01:54:45.070 --> 01:54:46.370
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So I love it.</v>

2355
01:54:46.610 --> 01:54:48.230
<v Speaker 6>I love coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I like the feeling,</v>

2356
01:54:48.380 --> 01:54:50.000
<v Speaker 6>what it gives to me.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I liked the way it tastes.</v>

2357
01:54:50.100 --> 01:54:52.340
<v Speaker 6>I feel the same way about pond.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I love it.</v>

2358
01:54:52.490 --> 01:54:52.970
<v Speaker 6>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't,</v>

2359
01:54:53.030 --> 01:54:54.650
<v Speaker 6>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Not only do I not think,</v>

2360
01:54:55.310 --> 01:54:57.590
<v Speaker 6>I absolutely don't think it's </v>
<v Speaker 6>detrimental.</v>

2361
01:54:57.800 --> 01:55:01.580
<v Speaker 6>I adore it and I think it helps my life.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I adore it.</v>

2362
01:55:01.760 --> 01:55:06.760
<v Speaker 6>I don't have any negatives.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've figured me and pot of a fucking </v>

2363
01:55:06.760 --> 01:55:10.541
<v Speaker 6>super good relationship and sometimes it</v>
<v Speaker 6>leaves me tired and I can't remember </v>

2364
01:55:10.541 --> 01:55:14.801
<v Speaker 6>exactly what I just said,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it provides me with so much </v>

2365
01:55:14.801 --> 01:55:17.270
<v Speaker 6>inspiration and introspective thinking </v>
<v Speaker 6>that the,</v>

2366
01:55:17.271 --> 01:55:18.320
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the counter,</v>

2367
01:55:18.321 --> 01:55:20.090
<v Speaker 6>like the payoff is huge</v>

2368
01:55:20.810 --> 01:55:21.670
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huge.</v>

2369
01:55:21.710 --> 01:55:25.310
<v Speaker 1>You add to that having a fucking hole in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the universe,</v>

2370
01:55:25.311 --> 01:55:29.420
<v Speaker 1>in your goddamn house.</v>

2372
01:55:30.801 --> 01:55:32.120

<v Speaker 1>Don't know.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Like when I was like,</v>

2376
01:55:39.021 --> 01:55:41.570
<v Speaker 1>you would say it to me when I car's </v>
<v Speaker 1>about to get repossessed.</v>

2377

<v Speaker 5>a man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

<v Speaker 5>apartments and in their apartment they </v>

<v Speaker 5>You have someone who maintains it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People sign up for it.</v>

2397
01:56:22.620 --> 01:56:27.620
<v Speaker 5>Don't let just anybody use it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Make sure that the guy who runs into </v>

2398
01:56:27.620 --> 01:56:30.620
<v Speaker 5>creepers,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to peek in on chicks whether </v>

<v Speaker 5>put a lock on the door,</v>

2400
01:56:30.620 --> 01:56:32.400
<v Speaker 5>make sure you know these people are </v>
<v Speaker 5>going to shit in it.</v>

2401
01:56:32.401 --> 01:56:33.510
<v Speaker 5>There's no way around it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He'll.</v>

2402
01:56:33.540 --> 01:56:35.470
<v Speaker 5>You'll know who did it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They have to sign up,</v>

2403
01:56:35.540 --> 01:56:40.540
<v Speaker 5>right the fuck that guy will the victim </v>
<v Speaker 5>that's you get evicted from the </v>

2404
01:56:40.540 --> 01:56:42.890
<v Speaker 5>apartment complex to fight on top of the</v>
<v Speaker 5>apartment conflict area manager.</v>

2405
01:56:42.920 --> 01:56:47.920
<v Speaker 5>So went shit in that water.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't matter how many times they </v>

2406
01:56:47.920 --> 01:56:47.920
<v Speaker 5>filter it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're not getting all this shit out.</v>

2407
01:56:47.920 --> 01:56:50.280
<v Speaker 5>You have to take all the water out and </v>
<v Speaker 5>clean the whole thing that water.</v>

2408
01:56:50.290 --> 01:56:55.290
<v Speaker 5>The next time you climb in and there's </v>
<v Speaker 5>going to be something in there that </v>

2409
01:56:55.290 --> 01:56:57.650
<v Speaker 5>bites yet,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what do you think the number is </v>

2410
01:56:57.650 --> 01:56:58.920
<v Speaker 5>worldwide of people that have taken big </v>
<v Speaker 5>shifts in isolation tanks?</v>

2411
01:56:59.130 --> 01:57:00.280
<v Speaker 5>Thousand Dollars.</v>

2412
01:57:02.970 --> 01:57:07.970
<v Speaker 5>Imagine if there was a compilation video</v>
<v Speaker 5>of every person who has ever taken a </v>

2413
01:57:08.011 --> 01:57:11.180
<v Speaker 5>shit inside the isolation tank and you </v>
<v Speaker 5>can just watch it happen in real time.</v>

2414
01:57:13.170 --> 01:57:14.250
<v Speaker 5>People are awful.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You would.</v>

2415
01:57:14.320 --> 01:57:19.320
<v Speaker 5>You'd be insisting that people are awful</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I think that's one of the real </v>

2416
01:57:19.320 --> 01:57:20.130
<v Speaker 5>problems with judging the human beings </v>
<v Speaker 5>as a,</v>

2417
01:57:20.250 --> 01:57:22.440
<v Speaker 5>as a race.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So there's too many of us.</v>

2418
01:57:22.740 --> 01:57:26.190
<v Speaker 5>So if there's 7 billion people it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>while we're saying this,</v>

2419
01:57:26.400 --> 01:57:28.200
<v Speaker 5>50 dudes are shitting and tanks right </v>
<v Speaker 5>now,</v>

2420
01:57:28.920 --> 01:57:30.390
<v Speaker 5>for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2421
01:57:30.450 --> 01:57:35.450
<v Speaker 5>This tanks aren't even that common.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's not that many tanks in the </v>

2422
01:57:35.450 --> 01:57:38.811
<v Speaker 5>world,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but if people don't like the best over </v>

2423
01:57:38.811 --> 01:57:41.601
<v Speaker 5>the course of this podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll say over the course of this </v>

2424
01:57:41.601 --> 01:57:43.791
<v Speaker 5>podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and that's a conservative estimate </v>

2425
01:57:43.791 --> 01:57:43.791
<v Speaker 5>taking how many fucking idiots there </v>
<v Speaker 5>are.</v>

2426
01:57:43.791 --> 01:57:44.640
<v Speaker 5>That just shit their pants.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How many people are there?</v>

2427
01:57:44.641 --> 01:57:49.641
<v Speaker 5>They're so stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They just shit their pants all the time </v>

2428
01:57:49.641 --> 01:57:50.070
<v Speaker 5>necessarily a measurement of Iq.</v>

2429
01:57:50.340 --> 01:57:52.130
<v Speaker 5>They shit their bed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They,</v>

2430
01:57:52.131 --> 01:57:52.950
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when I was in,</v>

2431
01:57:54.020 --> 01:57:55.550
<v Speaker 5>when I was in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I had to,</v>

2432
01:57:56.890 --> 01:57:58.300
<v Speaker 5>I had a girlfriend.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've told this story before,</v>

2433
01:57:58.301 --> 01:58:00.090
<v Speaker 5>but it's very unfortunate.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And her roommate,</v>

2434
01:58:00.180 --> 01:58:02.520
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>used to have anal sex with her boyfriend</v>

2435
01:58:02.730 --> 01:58:05.470
<v Speaker 5>and she wrote a letter about it that the</v>
<v Speaker 5>reason why he does it,</v>

2436
01:58:05.790 --> 01:58:10.790
<v Speaker 5>he's a little dick and it doesn't feel </v>
<v Speaker 5>good unless he puts it in her ass and </v>

2437
01:58:10.790 --> 01:58:13.010
<v Speaker 5>like it's very sobering for this poor </v>
<v Speaker 5>gentleman and found this letter or her,</v>

2438
01:58:13.060 --> 01:58:15.090
<v Speaker 5>her diary or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but shit,</v>

2439
01:58:15.091 --> 01:58:17.190
<v Speaker 5>the bed when they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they had,</v>

2440
01:58:17.460 --> 01:58:21.570
<v Speaker 5>they had anal sex and apparently it </v>
<v Speaker 5>relaxed her sphincter to the point where</v>

2441
01:58:21.571 --> 01:58:25.050
<v Speaker 5>she just relaxed in bed while sleeping </v>
<v Speaker 5>and just shat in the bed.</v>

2442
01:58:25.680 --> 01:58:30.680
<v Speaker 5>And Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And like the dude was just standing in </v>

2443
01:58:30.680 --> 01:58:32.631
<v Speaker 5>the hallway like a random,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like I came out of my girlfriend's </v>

2444
01:58:32.631 --> 01:58:34.050
<v Speaker 5>bedroom and he was there in the hall of </v>
<v Speaker 5>his hands out.</v>

2445
01:58:34.200 --> 01:58:35.910
<v Speaker 5>Like after she had just shit on him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was like,</v>

2446
01:58:35.911 --> 01:58:40.911
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I never forget this poor,</v>

2447
01:58:41.030 --> 01:58:41.350
<v Speaker 5>poor</v>

2448
01:58:43.690 --> 01:58:46.930
<v Speaker 6>what the fuck someone just shit on him </v>
<v Speaker 6>because he was having anal sex with this</v>

2449
01:58:46.931 --> 01:58:51.880
<v Speaker 6>girl he released.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So what I'm saying is that poor gal,</v>

2450
01:58:52.150 --> 01:58:53.970
<v Speaker 6>with whatever damage he did to her </v>
<v Speaker 6>butthole,</v>

2451
01:58:54.220 --> 01:58:57.220
<v Speaker 6>she could probably shit the bed if she </v>
<v Speaker 6>went to an isolation tank,</v>

2452
01:58:57.520 --> 01:58:58.720
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>she wasn't paying attention.</v>

2453
01:58:58.721 --> 01:59:00.610
<v Speaker 6>She got a little too relaxed and fell </v>
<v Speaker 6>asleep in there.</v>

2454
01:59:00.850 --> 01:59:05.850
<v Speaker 6>You can get your bed,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you can shit an isolation tank area can </v>

2455
01:59:05.850 --> 01:59:06.280
<v Speaker 6>and people shit the bed.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They just do.</v>

2456
01:59:06.340 --> 01:59:07.960
<v Speaker 6>They just do.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2457
01:59:07.961 --> 01:59:10.090
<v Speaker 6>I mean they do.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's no way around it.</v>

2458
01:59:10.310 --> 01:59:11.040
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I get,</v>

2459
01:59:11.120 --> 01:59:15.190
<v Speaker 6>I guess I think of like if you were in </v>
<v Speaker 6>there and like you had just blasted some</v>

2460
01:59:15.191 --> 01:59:20.191
<v Speaker 6>academy and into your bloodstream or </v>
<v Speaker 6>south thing and you were just really </v>

2461
01:59:20.191 --> 01:59:24.121
<v Speaker 6>gone and maybe your body will just </v>
<v Speaker 6>evacuate it's bowels because it wanted </v>

2462
01:59:24.121 --> 01:59:24.190
<v Speaker 6>to,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2463
01:59:24.191 --> 01:59:27.700
<v Speaker 6>your astral body is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>who knows where you're on Venus,</v>

2464
01:59:27.701 --> 01:59:29.070
<v Speaker 6>you're not even in the float tank.</v>

2465
01:59:29.100 --> 01:59:31.420
<v Speaker 6>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're just a monkey in there now.</v>

2466
01:59:31.480 --> 01:59:32.860
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I would imagine that's definitely,</v>

2467
01:59:32.950 --> 01:59:35.440
<v Speaker 6>probably happened to somebody that took </v>
<v Speaker 6>some drug.</v>

2468
01:59:35.860 --> 01:59:36.610
<v Speaker 6>Did you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

2469
01:59:36.730 --> 01:59:39.280
<v Speaker 6>have you talked to Neal Brennan at all?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Do you know Neil?</v>

2470
01:59:39.430 --> 01:59:40.780
<v Speaker 6>I know Neil,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I haven't talked to him.</v>

2471
01:59:40.870 --> 01:59:42.010
<v Speaker 6>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've got to take a leak.</v>

2472
01:59:42.040 --> 01:59:43.840
<v Speaker 6>Please go ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Go ahead and do it.</v>

2473
01:59:44.010 --> 01:59:46.050
<v Speaker 6>And when you come back,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'll return to you,</v>

<v Speaker 6>outfit.</v>

2475
01:59:49.300 --> 01:59:54.300
<v Speaker 6>When you return,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'll tell you about neal Brennan taking </v>

2476
01:59:54.300 --> 01:59:54.300
<v Speaker 6>ketamine for therapy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Did you know about that?</v>

2477
01:59:54.300 --> 01:59:55.780
<v Speaker 6>Come,</v>
<v Speaker 6>come back young Jesus.</v>

2478
01:59:56.320 --> 01:59:59.650
<v Speaker 6>What are you a bishop or some shit?</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's a bishop.</v>

2479
02:00:00.310 --> 02:00:01.510
<v Speaker 6>Duncan trussell.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

2480
02:00:01.511 --> 02:00:02.530
<v Speaker 6>Bishop,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2481
02:00:02.531 --> 02:00:03.370
<v Speaker 6>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2482
02:00:03.460 --> 02:00:06.610
<v Speaker 6>have never listened at Duncan trussell's</v>
<v Speaker 6>podcasts and you're tuning into this,</v>

2483
02:00:06.611 --> 02:00:11.611
<v Speaker 6>maybe this is the first podcast here,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we listened to the Duncan trussell </v>

2484
02:00:11.611 --> 02:00:14.431
<v Speaker 6>family hour is for real,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like probably one of the best podcasts </v>

2485
02:00:14.431 --> 02:00:17.760
<v Speaker 6>in the known universe and Duncan is a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>an oddly articulate and very bizarre </v>

2486
02:00:18.191 --> 02:00:20.140
<v Speaker 6>character that I don't know anybody like</v>
<v Speaker 6>him,</v>

2487
02:00:20.630 --> 02:00:24.280
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and he has a very interesting and unique</v>

2488
02:00:24.281 --> 02:00:25.240
<v Speaker 6>way of looking at shit.</v>

2489
02:00:25.600 --> 02:00:30.600
<v Speaker 6>And one of the reason why I like doing </v>
<v Speaker 6>podcasts with them because I feel like </v>

2490
02:00:30.600 --> 02:00:33.931
<v Speaker 6>that when Duncan and I get together,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we both pull some weird part out of each</v>

2491
02:00:34.031 --> 02:00:39.031
<v Speaker 6>other.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's what I felt like when we were </v>

2492
02:00:39.031 --> 02:00:40.990
<v Speaker 6>doing that stupid Scifi show when we </v>
<v Speaker 6>were talking to people about bigfoot and</v>

2493
02:00:40.991 --> 02:00:45.991
<v Speaker 6>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But that's how I feel when I do any </v>

2494
02:00:45.991 --> 02:00:45.991
<v Speaker 6>podcasts with him.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's just a very,</v>

2495
02:00:45.991 --> 02:00:48.880
<v Speaker 6>very unusual dude.</v>

<v Speaker 5>I want to do the Kentucky Derby next </v>

<v Speaker 5>year and do a standup show in town.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want to know what the fuck that's all </v>

2544
02:02:52.210 --> 02:02:54.881
<v Speaker 5>about.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Horse racing was not even about the </v>

2545
02:02:54.881 --> 02:02:54.881
<v Speaker 5>race,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so at everybody getting fucked up.</v>

2546
02:02:55.010 --> 02:02:56.810
<v Speaker 5>That's what it's about,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2547
02:02:56.930 --> 02:02:58.830
<v Speaker 5>My Buddy Cameron hanes went this year </v>
<v Speaker 5>and you're like,</v>

2548
02:02:58.831 --> 02:03:00.560
<v Speaker 5>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>

2549
02:03:00.561 --> 02:03:03.170
<v Speaker 5>it's just people just getting drunk like</v>
<v Speaker 5>everywhere you go.</v>

2550
02:03:03.171 --> 02:03:06.470
<v Speaker 5>Everyone is just plowed by a hunter.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Thompson.</v>

2551
02:03:06.471 --> 02:03:11.471
<v Speaker 5>One of his early pieces of work that got</v>
<v Speaker 5>him notoriety was he did a bit on the </v>

2552
02:03:12.740 --> 02:03:17.740
<v Speaker 5>Kentucky Derby.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The Kentucky Derby is decadent and </v>

2553
02:03:17.740 --> 02:03:17.740
<v Speaker 5>deprived and his store in the Kentucky </v>
<v Speaker 5>Derby.</v>

2554
02:03:17.740 --> 02:03:22.320
<v Speaker 5>It's fascinating because it starts out </v>
<v Speaker 5>just just describing the heinous people </v>

2555
02:03:23.270 --> 02:03:25.790
<v Speaker 5>around them and then realizing you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>one of those people.</v>

2556
02:03:25.970 --> 02:03:29.000
<v Speaker 5>At the end he realized he's one of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>monsters that he's been describing.</v>

2557
02:03:30.350 --> 02:03:33.020
<v Speaker 5>That's awesome,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's just one of those things.</v>

2558
02:03:33.021 --> 02:03:38.021
<v Speaker 5>It's been going on forever and it's like</v>
<v Speaker 5>connected to this ancient culture of </v>

2559
02:03:38.460 --> 02:03:40.580
<v Speaker 5>riverboat gamblers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>

2560
02:03:40.581 --> 02:03:42.110
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's what the Kentucky Derby is like.</v>

2561
02:03:42.111 --> 02:03:45.890
<v Speaker 5>The ultimate gambler experience.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Drunken excess.</v>

2562
02:03:45.920 --> 02:03:49.070
<v Speaker 5>It's like mint Juleps.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's that.</v>

2563
02:03:49.071 --> 02:03:51.770
<v Speaker 5>It's getting hammered and it's horse </v>
<v Speaker 5>races,</v>

2564
02:03:52.220 --> 02:03:55.580
<v Speaker 5>but it's like this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like a social event where people go</v>

2565
02:03:55.581 --> 02:03:58.580
<v Speaker 5>and have a great time and apparently the</v>
<v Speaker 5>vibe there is incredible.</v>

2566
02:03:58.581 --> 02:04:03.581
<v Speaker 5>Like it's like really fun,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like chaotic and people do just get </v>

2567
02:04:03.581 --> 02:04:07.571
<v Speaker 5>fucking shit faced shit faced and I </v>
<v Speaker 5>think if we went and got shit faced with</v>

2568
02:04:09.801 --> 02:04:10.490
<v Speaker 5>these people.</v>

2569
02:04:11.020 --> 02:04:12.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That can be super fun man.</v>

2570
02:04:12.581 --> 02:04:15.300
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's places to go get shit </v>
<v Speaker 1>faced out.</v>

2571
02:04:15.301 --> 02:04:15.740
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

2572
02:04:15.770 --> 02:04:20.770
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I want to experience the Kentucky </v>

2573
02:04:20.770 --> 02:04:22.860
<v Speaker 1>Derby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Kentucky Derby is something that </v>

2574
02:04:22.860 --> 02:04:22.860
<v Speaker 1>I've heard of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know enough about.</v>

2575
02:04:22.860 --> 02:04:22.860
<v Speaker 1>Even like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Like why don't we do that man.</v>

2577
02:04:24.281 --> 02:04:29.281
<v Speaker 1>We could just go to burning man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that large?</v>

2578
02:04:31.380 --> 02:04:34.420
<v Speaker 1>A bunch of horses gallop around </v>
<v Speaker 1>alcoholics.</v>

2579
02:04:34.510 --> 02:04:39.510
<v Speaker 1>When you go to the middle of the desert </v>
<v Speaker 1>where there's shooting laser beams into </v>

2580
02:04:39.510 --> 02:04:43.101
<v Speaker 1>space and giant squid tanks are rolling </v>
<v Speaker 1>by shooting fire or we could do both.</v>

2581
02:04:44.760 --> 02:04:46.500
<v Speaker 1>That's impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not the.</v>

2582
02:04:46.840 --> 02:04:49.530
<v Speaker 1>That's on different dates now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know I'm joking.</v>

2583
02:04:50.150 --> 02:04:51.210
<v Speaker 1>Can do both.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2584
02:04:51.630 --> 02:04:56.630
<v Speaker 1>That's what we should've done for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So to you and me looking for a </v>

2585
02:04:56.630 --> 02:04:59.310
<v Speaker 1>nonexistent unknown primate wandering </v>
<v Speaker 1>through the woods of the Pacific </v>

2586
02:04:59.310 --> 02:05:00.870
<v Speaker 1>northwest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we should have gone to raves.</v>

2587
02:05:01.260 --> 02:05:02.520
<v Speaker 1>We should have found real freaks.</v>

2588
02:05:02.550 --> 02:05:04.750
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2589
02:05:04.860 --> 02:05:06.420
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2590
02:05:06.450 --> 02:05:11.450
<v Speaker 1>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's so many other ways to like </v>

2591
02:05:11.450 --> 02:05:13.551
<v Speaker 1>analyze the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we're as far as science goes or </v>

2592
02:05:13.551 --> 02:05:18.521
<v Speaker 1>somebody who's going to do a scientific </v>
<v Speaker 1>investigation if things were pretty far </v>

2593
02:05:18.521 --> 02:05:22.941
<v Speaker 1>away from the ideal scientist and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>weren't really doing science and we're </v>

2594
02:05:22.941 --> 02:05:25.620
<v Speaker 1>looking for bigfoot bullshit detecting </v>
<v Speaker 1>where you really are doing now.</v>

2595
02:05:25.621 --> 02:05:27.090
<v Speaker 1>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean man.</v>

2596
02:05:27.091 --> 02:05:29.460
<v Speaker 1>I think that it's like what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what ends up happening?</v>

2597
02:05:29.730 --> 02:05:33.270
<v Speaker 1>Because TV shows have got to like having</v>
<v Speaker 1>to wrap everything up.</v>

2598
02:05:33.300 --> 02:05:35.220
<v Speaker 1>You got to have a point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to have a thing.</v>

2599
02:05:35.221 --> 02:05:38.340
<v Speaker 1>You can't do what a podcast dies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is just whatever you want.</v>

2600
02:05:38.341 --> 02:05:40.410
<v Speaker 1>And I can't they do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2601
02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:43.810
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess I don't know.</v>

2602
02:05:43.811 --> 02:05:46.140
<v Speaker 1>I mean why can't they have like a late </v>
<v Speaker 1>night show that,</v>

2603
02:05:46.170 --> 02:05:48.570
<v Speaker 1>why don't they have a late night show </v>
<v Speaker 1>look after and I chose over.</v>

2604
02:05:48.570 --> 02:05:51.030
<v Speaker 1>That just goes on for like three hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

2605
02:05:51.570 --> 02:05:56.570
<v Speaker 1>I'm just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just two dudes talking or whatever </v>

2606
02:05:56.570 --> 02:05:56.770
<v Speaker 1>and a guest and talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No band.</v>

2607
02:05:56.820 --> 02:05:57.780
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a fucking band.</v>

2608
02:05:57.810 --> 02:06:02.810
<v Speaker 1>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you a baby and I need to play </v>

2609
02:06:02.810 --> 02:06:04.281
<v Speaker 1>music for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think people would take great comfort </v>

2610
02:06:04.281 --> 02:06:08.391
<v Speaker 1>in that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the problem is you can't do it </v>

2611
02:06:08.391 --> 02:06:11.150
<v Speaker 1>because of the way TV works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every single thing that anybody says on </v>

2612
02:06:11.150 --> 02:06:14.691
<v Speaker 1>tv,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's got to go through a filter and </v>

2613
02:06:14.691 --> 02:06:14.880
<v Speaker 1>that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you call it,</v>

2614
02:06:14.881 --> 02:06:18.090
<v Speaker 1>the regulatory bureau that makes sure </v>
<v Speaker 1>people say that.</v>

2615
02:06:18.091 --> 02:06:23.091
<v Speaker 1>People say things that aren't like curse</v>
<v Speaker 1>words or what's that called?</v>

2616
02:06:23.791 --> 02:06:26.010
<v Speaker 1>There's a name for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Standards and practices,</v>

2617
02:06:26.280 --> 02:06:30.330
<v Speaker 1>so everything has to run through that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think that the idea of having.</v>

2618
02:06:30.350 --> 02:06:32.730
<v Speaker 1>And you could do it on Hbo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess you'd have to have it on a.</v>

2619
02:06:33.350 --> 02:06:38.350
<v Speaker 1>on a non a public station.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It needs to be a subscription TV </v>

2620
02:06:38.971 --> 02:06:40.380
<v Speaker 1>station.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could probably pull that off,</v>

2621
02:06:40.381 --> 02:06:45.381
<v Speaker 1>but you can't do it on NBC.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't have people talk for three </v>

2622
02:06:45.381 --> 02:06:48.561
<v Speaker 1>hours because inevitably somebody is </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to start really saying the truth </v>

2623
02:06:48.561 --> 02:06:52.911
<v Speaker 1>or they're going to start saying a truth</v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't fit in with selling cell </v>

2624
02:06:52.911 --> 02:06:53.520
<v Speaker 1>phones in mass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's going to be.</v>

2625
02:06:53.940 --> 02:06:57.660
<v Speaker 1>They're not going to like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you do stand up on those shows,</v>

2626
02:06:57.661 --> 02:06:59.100
<v Speaker 1>you've got to show them your set,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2627
02:06:59.370 --> 02:07:01.830
<v Speaker 1>They analyze every line,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every sentence,</v>

2628
02:07:02.220 --> 02:07:07.220
<v Speaker 1>every word gets analyzed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to show them like a written </v>

2629
02:07:07.220 --> 02:07:10.911
<v Speaker 1>transcript of things are going to say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you imagine if we tried to show a </v>

2630
02:07:10.911 --> 02:07:13.230
<v Speaker 1>network this transcript of what we </v>
<v Speaker 1>talked about here today,</v>

2631
02:07:13.480 --> 02:07:15.200
<v Speaker 1>like the notes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many I.</v>

2632
02:07:15.201 --> 02:07:20.201
<v Speaker 1>I imagined that we would get over 7,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>pages of notes back.</v>

2633
02:07:20.460 --> 02:07:25.460
<v Speaker 1>I bet the notes that we get would be 500</v>
<v Speaker 1>times longer than the episode itself.</v>

2634
02:07:25.680 --> 02:07:30.680
<v Speaker 1>Did I ever tell you that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>My friend Amir was a writer on the </v>

2635
02:07:30.680 --> 02:07:30.680
<v Speaker 1>early,</v>
<v Speaker 1>early,</v>

2636
02:07:30.680 --> 02:07:35.091
<v Speaker 1>early days of Conan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now through a lot of comics wrote for </v>

2637
02:07:35.091 --> 02:07:35.920
<v Speaker 1>Conan in the early,</v>
<v Speaker 1>early days,</v>

2638
02:07:36.160 --> 02:07:38.050
<v Speaker 6>and my friend Amir,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Amir Golan,</v>

2639
02:07:38.051 --> 02:07:39.940
<v Speaker 6>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 6>his name is James Lemur.</v>

2640
02:07:39.941 --> 02:07:42.010
<v Speaker 6>That was a stage name.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Really Funny Dude from Boston,</v>

2641
02:07:42.370 --> 02:07:47.110
<v Speaker 6>he and so I was there for the early,</v>
<v Speaker 6>early filmings when I was like,</v>

2642
02:07:47.111 --> 02:07:50.220
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I guess I was like kind of working maybe</v>

2643
02:07:50.230 --> 02:07:55.230
<v Speaker 6>like just starting to work and go,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well I didn't have any money and I was </v>

2644
02:07:55.230 --> 02:07:55.230
<v Speaker 6>told scrub,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I was his friends.</v>

2645
02:07:55.230 --> 02:07:56.650
<v Speaker 6>I went to botch and they,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they all,</v>

2646
02:07:56.651 --> 02:08:01.651
<v Speaker 6>the Andy Richter,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Conan O'brien interactions were </v>

2647
02:08:01.651 --> 02:08:01.651
<v Speaker 6>scripted.</v>
<v Speaker 6>One hundred percent scripted.</v>

2648
02:08:01.651 --> 02:08:04.120
<v Speaker 6>They had cue cards above them so they </v>
<v Speaker 6>weren't talking.</v>

2649
02:08:04.630 --> 02:08:07.070
<v Speaker 6>They were fake.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're fake talking like,</v>

2650
02:08:07.270 --> 02:08:09.640
<v Speaker 6>like if you and I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we're going to talk about this right now</v>

2651
02:08:09.641 --> 02:08:14.641
<v Speaker 6>and it would have all this shit that I </v>
<v Speaker 6>was going to say already written out and</v>

2652
02:08:15.430 --> 02:08:20.430
<v Speaker 6>it was a sign behind each other,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like a sign behind the Indian guy </v>

2653
02:08:20.430 --> 02:08:24.451
<v Speaker 6>holding the sign behind Kona because </v>
<v Speaker 6>we're talking about like 1990 or some </v>

2654
02:08:24.451 --> 02:08:24.451
<v Speaker 6>shit.</v>

2655
02:08:24.451 --> 02:08:28.320
<v Speaker 6>When did the Conan O'brien show start?</v>
<v Speaker 6>What year did the Conan O'brien show </v>

2656
02:08:28.320 --> 02:08:28.780
<v Speaker 6>start?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to say like 91 or 92.</v>

2657
02:08:29.170 --> 02:08:32.380
<v Speaker 6>Somewhere around there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's if I had to guess at the latest,</v>

2658
02:08:32.381 --> 02:08:35.140
<v Speaker 6>I could think it'd be like 93.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But it was weird.</v>

2659
02:08:35.590 --> 02:08:37.300
<v Speaker 6>Weird.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's really weird.</v>

2660
02:08:37.301 --> 02:08:40.270
<v Speaker 6>It's like you're watching pirates of the</v>
<v Speaker 6>Caribbean or something,</v>

2661
02:08:42.020 --> 02:08:44.260
<v Speaker 6>so it's straight,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but they don't do that anymore.</v>

2662
02:08:44.410 --> 02:08:49.410
<v Speaker 6>Thank God.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But I mean he had to go to fucking tbs </v>

2663
02:08:49.410 --> 02:08:49.630
<v Speaker 6>to probably get rid of the 93.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There we go.</v>

2664
02:08:50.190 --> 02:08:51.310
<v Speaker 6>That was pretty close.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2665
02:08:51.450 --> 02:08:53.350
<v Speaker 6>I don't get that man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean it's so I,</v>

2666
02:08:53.351 --> 02:08:55.420
<v Speaker 6>I can't wait for that to change.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's.</v>

2667
02:08:55.450 --> 02:08:57.730
<v Speaker 6>TV's going to get so much better.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They don't do that anymore.</v>

2668
02:08:57.760 --> 02:08:58.990
<v Speaker 6>Nobody does.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Nobody does that.</v>

2669
02:08:58.991 --> 02:09:01.840
<v Speaker 6>They did that because he was a writer </v>
<v Speaker 6>who did that because he was a writer.</v>

2670
02:09:01.841 --> 02:09:06.841
<v Speaker 6>They really didn't have a performance </v>
<v Speaker 6>background and all of a sudden he was </v>

2671
02:09:06.841 --> 02:09:09.601
<v Speaker 6>hosting this late night talk show </v>
<v Speaker 6>because he was so funny because in </v>

2672
02:09:09.601 --> 02:09:11.710
<v Speaker 6>writer's rooms,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Conan O'brien would just smash.</v>

2673
02:09:11.860 --> 02:09:16.860
<v Speaker 6>He was the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He was so fucking funny and his jokes </v>

2674
02:09:16.860 --> 02:09:17.830
<v Speaker 6>were so good that in writer's rooms they</v>
<v Speaker 6>will like Jesus Christ,</v>

2675
02:09:17.831 --> 02:09:19.560
<v Speaker 6>you should be a fucking comic.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like should be.</v>

2676
02:09:19.740 --> 02:09:22.150
<v Speaker 6>You should be the host of a show.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then the next thing you know,</v>

2677
02:09:22.151 --> 02:09:23.710
<v Speaker 6>a bunch of people got behind him and </v>
<v Speaker 6>they said,</v>

2678
02:09:23.711 --> 02:09:24.910
<v Speaker 6>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we're gonna bankroll him.</v>

2679
02:09:24.911 --> 02:09:26.520
<v Speaker 6>I'll have him do the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And you know,</v>

2680
02:09:26.830 --> 02:09:29.740
<v Speaker 6>once he loosened up and got used to the </v>
<v Speaker 6>role,</v>

2681
02:09:29.741 --> 02:09:30.400
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2682
02:09:30.460 --> 02:09:34.030
<v Speaker 6>he became like one of a lot of people's </v>
<v Speaker 6>favorite.</v>

2683
02:09:34.860 --> 02:09:37.570
<v Speaker 6>Watching the early show and watching </v>
<v Speaker 6>them do it.</v>

2684
02:09:37.571 --> 02:09:39.750
<v Speaker 6>Like what a script.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was very enlightenment.</v>

2685
02:09:39.810 --> 02:09:42.500
<v Speaker 6>What would you do this as a late night </v>
<v Speaker 6>show to.</v>

2686
02:09:42.540 --> 02:09:44.830
<v Speaker 6>I'm sure you've gotten.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Someone has got.</v>

2687
02:09:44.890 --> 02:09:47.560
<v Speaker 6>Must've come to you by now.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is early morning show.</v>

2688
02:09:47.561 --> 02:09:49.870
<v Speaker 6>It's a late night show.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a mid afternoon show.</v>

2689
02:09:49.900 --> 02:09:52.630
<v Speaker 6>It's available whenever you want it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's 24 hours a day,</v>

2690
02:09:52.631 --> 02:09:53.610
<v Speaker 6>seven days a week.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And.</v>

2691
02:09:54.110 --> 02:09:59.110
<v Speaker 6>But do you ever think about like how,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how often do you think about translating</v>

2692
02:09:59.981 --> 02:10:02.700
<v Speaker 6>it to the TV environment or something?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Never.</v>

2693
02:10:02.950 --> 02:10:04.720
<v Speaker 6>Almost never.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Almost never.</v>

2694
02:10:04.760 --> 02:10:06.450
<v Speaker 6>You must get pitched all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

2695
02:10:06.490 --> 02:10:07.990
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't even,</v>

2696
02:10:08.050 --> 02:10:09.250
<v Speaker 6>I don't even take pitches.</v>

2697
02:10:11.320 --> 02:10:13.390
<v Speaker 6>I don't want to do anything other than </v>
<v Speaker 6>what I'm doing right now.</v>

2698
02:10:13.450 --> 02:10:15.320
<v Speaker 6>I've thought about it before and you </v>
<v Speaker 6>know the,</v>

2699
02:10:15.470 --> 02:10:17.350
<v Speaker 6>the experience of doing the spike TV </v>
<v Speaker 6>thing,</v>

2700
02:10:17.820 --> 02:10:20.710
<v Speaker 6>the Scifi thing rather.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What was fun was doing with you.</v>

2701
02:10:20.910 --> 02:10:21.730
<v Speaker 6>That's what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Fun.</v>

2702
02:10:21.790 --> 02:10:26.790
<v Speaker 6>That was what was fun,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it's not fun dealing with all those </v>

2703
02:10:26.790 --> 02:10:26.830
<v Speaker 6>other people.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Not The people that we worked with.</v>

2704
02:10:26.860 --> 02:10:31.860
<v Speaker 6>Although the producers on that side were</v>
<v Speaker 6>great and a lot of people in the </v>

2705
02:10:31.860 --> 02:10:31.860
<v Speaker 6>networks that were great,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but there were so many voices.</v>

2706
02:10:31.860 --> 02:10:36.630
<v Speaker 6>It wasn't even that they were bad folks.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're dealing with too many people in </v>

2707
02:10:36.630 --> 02:10:39.971
<v Speaker 6>it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Everybody's got discrepancies and I </v>

2708
02:10:39.971 --> 02:10:39.971
<v Speaker 6>think it should go like this and maybe </v>
<v Speaker 6>you should try that.</v>

2709
02:10:39.971 --> 02:10:41.060
<v Speaker 6>Or maybe you can come in here.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Maybe he could dress different.</v>

2710
02:10:41.180 --> 02:10:43.790
<v Speaker 6>Maybe you could hold that or maybe you </v>
<v Speaker 6>could stand there like,</v>

2711
02:10:43.791 --> 02:10:44.780
<v Speaker 6>fuck man.</v>

2712
02:10:44.780 --> 02:10:46.670
<v Speaker 6>There's too many of you talking like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>look,</v>

2713
02:10:46.671 --> 02:10:51.671
<v Speaker 6>we're trying to make the best thing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but you're not the person that's going </v>

2714
02:10:51.671 --> 02:10:52.160
<v Speaker 6>to like figure me out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

2715
02:10:52.700 --> 02:10:57.700
<v Speaker 6>I've got a good sense of who I am and if</v>
<v Speaker 6>you want me to wear a suit and tie and </v>

2716
02:10:57.700 --> 02:11:01.310
<v Speaker 6>you think it's going to change.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If I come in on a parachute or if I step</v>

2717
02:11:01.311 --> 02:11:04.640
<v Speaker 6>out of a fucking flaming Hula Hoop,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we're talking crazy.</v>

2718
02:11:05.060 --> 02:11:07.030
<v Speaker 6>I don't want to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like if I had,</v>

2719
02:11:07.280 --> 02:11:10.490
<v Speaker 6>if I want to sit down with some comedy </v>
<v Speaker 6>writers and bounce around some ideas,</v>

2720
02:11:10.640 --> 02:11:13.940
<v Speaker 6>I don't want a year to many people's </v>
<v Speaker 6>voices and that.</v>

2721
02:11:13.941 --> 02:11:15.950
<v Speaker 6>I mean it's their prerogative.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean if you're,</v>

2722
02:11:15.951 --> 02:11:18.350
<v Speaker 6>if you're on a television show or </v>
<v Speaker 6>somebody wants to pay for it,</v>

2723
02:11:18.380 --> 02:11:19.280
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>And it's not you.</v>

2724
02:11:19.400 --> 02:11:21.230
<v Speaker 6>So it's their prerogative to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But I don't want to be.</v>

2725
02:11:21.231 --> 02:11:26.231
<v Speaker 6>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I just don't think I operate the best </v>

2726
02:11:26.231 --> 02:11:26.231
<v Speaker 6>doing that.</v>

2727
02:11:26.231 --> 02:11:28.630
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't think this podcast would have </v>

2728
02:11:28.630 --> 02:11:29.060
<v Speaker 6>ever occurred if I had a boss who would </v>
<v Speaker 6>have never happened now and most of this</v>

2729
02:11:29.061 --> 02:11:32.810
<v Speaker 6>shit I would've never said and I would </v>
<v Speaker 6>have to like debate who the guests were.</v>

2730
02:11:32.990 --> 02:11:35.730
<v Speaker 6>The idea of debating who the guests are </v>
<v Speaker 6>make me wants to.</v>

2731
02:11:35.990 --> 02:11:40.990
<v Speaker 6>I just want to throw up like the idea of</v>
<v Speaker 6>have to convince someone that Joey Diaz </v>

2732
02:11:40.990 --> 02:11:42.540
<v Speaker 6>should be on Tuesday.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've got to convince them.</v>

2733
02:11:42.690 --> 02:11:45.230
<v Speaker 6>I know Joe has been on two months ago,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it doesn't matter.</v>

2734
02:11:45.350 --> 02:11:48.140
<v Speaker 6>You need a black guy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You need a black woman.</v>

2735
02:11:48.200 --> 02:11:49.940
<v Speaker 6>That's what you need on your podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a black woman.</v>

2736
02:11:49.941 --> 02:11:51.770
<v Speaker 6>What we're looking at your diversity </v>
<v Speaker 6>statistics,</v>

2737
02:11:52.470 --> 02:11:57.470
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to do what the fuck I want to </v>

2738
02:11:57.470 --> 02:11:58.430
<v Speaker 6>do and do whatever I want to do,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and the only way to do whatever you want</v>

2739
02:11:58.431 --> 02:11:59.600
<v Speaker 6>to do is to do your own thing.</v>

2740
02:11:59.990 --> 02:12:01.430
<v Speaker 6>As soon as you start doing it on </v>
<v Speaker 6>television,</v>

2741
02:12:01.431 --> 02:12:05.410
<v Speaker 6>you're not doing whatever you want to do</v>
<v Speaker 6>unless you become wildly successful like</v>

2742
02:12:05.420 --> 02:12:10.420
<v Speaker 6>south park,</v>
<v Speaker 6>to the point where they just leave you </v>

2743
02:12:10.420 --> 02:12:11.450
<v Speaker 6>the fuck alone and new regimes come and </v>
<v Speaker 6>go while you're still the king.</v>

2744
02:12:11.810 --> 02:12:14.360
<v Speaker 6>They just,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they don't say shit to Daniel Tosh.</v>

2745
02:12:14.600 --> 02:12:17.000
<v Speaker 6>Everybody just shuts the fuck up and </v>
<v Speaker 6>leaves them alone.</v>

2746
02:12:17.300 --> 02:12:20.150
<v Speaker 6>You don't want to fuck that up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You got a monolithic show.</v>

2747
02:12:20.180 --> 02:12:23.150
<v Speaker 6>Lucky South Park.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's been going on forever and it's just</v>

2748
02:12:23.151 --> 02:12:28.151
<v Speaker 6>as funny now as it's ever been.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Just stay the fuck away from them or </v>

2749
02:12:28.151 --> 02:12:28.151
<v Speaker 6>don't talk to them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Don't ruin anything.</v>

2750
02:12:28.151 --> 02:12:32.660
<v Speaker 3>Are there any examples of a show where </v>
<v Speaker 3>they let them do whatever they want at </v>

2751
02:12:32.660 --> 02:12:35.910
<v Speaker 3>and the show failed because of it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure.</v>

2752
02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:38.270
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure there have been no what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2753
02:12:38.290 --> 02:12:43.290
<v Speaker 3>There's got to be generally always here </v>
<v Speaker 3>with like Mr show or like a lot of the </v>

2754
02:12:43.290 --> 02:12:45.360
<v Speaker 3>great sketch groups or like any great </v>
<v Speaker 3>show.</v>

2755
02:12:45.361 --> 02:12:50.361
<v Speaker 3>One thing you always hear,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like they mostly just let us do </v>

2756
02:12:50.361 --> 02:12:52.300
<v Speaker 3>what we want it and it's the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's when the opposite effect happens.</v>

2757
02:12:52.420 --> 02:12:53.920
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's what the Chappelle show.</v>

2758
02:12:54.400 --> 02:12:57.400
<v Speaker 6>That's what broke the Chappelle show up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Dave Chappelle was like,</v>

2759
02:12:57.401 --> 02:13:02.401
<v Speaker 6>fuck this.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's too many people telling them </v>

2760
02:13:02.401 --> 02:13:02.710
<v Speaker 6>what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Saying them that he couldn't say certain</v>

2761
02:13:02.711 --> 02:13:03.940
<v Speaker 6>things,</v>
<v Speaker 6>couldn't you know?</v>

2762
02:13:04.060 --> 02:13:06.460
<v Speaker 6>There was a lot of money on the line for</v>
<v Speaker 6>that show.</v>

2763
02:13:07.660 --> 02:13:10.150
<v Speaker 6>He's talked about it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's talked about.</v>

2764
02:13:10.151 --> 02:13:11.350
<v Speaker 6>They wouldn't let him say the word </v>
<v Speaker 6>nigger.</v>

2765
02:13:11.380 --> 02:13:16.380
<v Speaker 6>Like there was a.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There was a real concern with him </v>

2766
02:13:16.380 --> 02:13:16.380
<v Speaker 6>continuing to say that word.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's crazy.</v>

2767
02:13:16.380 --> 02:13:20.970
<v Speaker 6>And they were saying that if he didn't </v>
<v Speaker 6>say they could make more money in </v>

2768
02:13:20.970 --> 02:13:21.280
<v Speaker 6>advertising,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I would love to really sit down with him</v>

2769
02:13:21.281 --> 02:13:23.270
<v Speaker 6>and find out what was.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What was like,</v>

2770
02:13:23.440 --> 02:13:26.200
<v Speaker 6>what was the feeling when all that was </v>
<v Speaker 6>happening?</v>

2771
02:13:26.330 --> 02:13:30.970
<v Speaker 6>What was the feeling of being connected </v>
<v Speaker 6>to this cultural monster rage?</v>

2772
02:13:31.050 --> 02:13:33.620
<v Speaker 6>I was on it twice,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I didn't.</v>

2773
02:13:33.850 --> 02:13:35.120
<v Speaker 6>I didn't really talk to them about.</v>

2774
02:13:35.120 --> 02:13:36.690
<v Speaker 6>It was in the time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was just like,</v>

2775
02:13:36.691 --> 02:13:37.680
<v Speaker 6>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is great.</v>

02:13:40.681 --> 02:13:42.030
<v Speaker 6>I'd love to be on it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was one of those things.</v>

2779
02:13:42.390 --> 02:13:43.350
<v Speaker 6>It wasn't like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

02:13:43.351 --> 02:13:44.680
<v Speaker 6>what is this like for you?</v>

2782
02:13:46.861 --> 02:13:51.861

<v Speaker 6>Did that fuck with you?</v>

2785
02:13:53.971 --> 02:13:58.971
<v Speaker 6>Because I know people used to heckle him</v>
<v Speaker 6>with that and it was like a real </v>

2786
02:13:58.971 --> 02:13:58.971
<v Speaker 6>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

<v Speaker 6>It was ridiculous.</v>

2790
02:14:04.110 --> 02:14:06.880
<v Speaker 6>They got to the point where they would </v>
<v Speaker 6>yell it out and he couldn't even compete</v>

2791
02:14:06.930 --> 02:14:09.400
<v Speaker 6>continuous show because like dumb white </v>

2794
02:14:14.820 --> 02:14:19.820

<v Speaker 6>but the point being what a weird </v>

2795
02:14:19.980 --> 02:14:22.710
<v Speaker 6>experience that must have been just to </v>
<v Speaker 6>be a human being,</v>

2796
02:14:22.711 --> 02:14:27.711
<v Speaker 6>to be at the tip of the comedy spear </v>
<v Speaker 6>like that for a while and then have a </v>

<v Speaker 6>bunch of people fuck with it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Have a bunch of people just wouldn't </v>

2832
02:16:01.691 --> 02:16:03.740
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But why he wasn't Chappelle.</v>

2833
02:16:03.741 --> 02:16:04.080
<v Speaker 1>Kind of</v>

2834
02:16:04.190 --> 02:16:06.950
<v Speaker 6>like wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 6>isn't he?</v>

2835
02:16:07.140 --> 02:16:09.810
<v Speaker 6>I don't know if he's still is busy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Kind of like an illuminati believer,</v>

2836
02:16:09.811 --> 02:16:12.300
<v Speaker 6>like aren't there interviews with him </v>
<v Speaker 6>where he kind of talks about,</v>

2837
02:16:13.080 --> 02:16:15.450
<v Speaker 6>well look,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>

2838
02:16:16.280 --> 02:16:18.570
<v Speaker 6>I haven't had these conversations with </v>
<v Speaker 6>him personally,</v>

2839
02:16:18.930 --> 02:16:21.360
<v Speaker 6>so I don't know the full extent of his </v>
<v Speaker 6>beliefs,</v>

2840
02:16:21.660 --> 02:16:24.690
<v Speaker 6>but he believes in some shit that's </v>
<v Speaker 6>real.</v>

2841
02:16:24.691 --> 02:16:27.180
<v Speaker 6>Like the Bilderberg group,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the fact that these industrial,</v>

2842
02:16:27.181 --> 02:16:30.040
<v Speaker 6>it's really do get together and meet and</v>
<v Speaker 6>try</v>

2843
02:16:30.040 --> 02:16:35.040
<v Speaker 1>to figure out how to continue running </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world the way it's run right now </v>

2844
02:16:35.040 --> 02:16:35.950
<v Speaker 1>because they're extracting massive </v>
<v Speaker 1>amounts of money from it.</v>

2845
02:16:36.420 --> 02:16:39.250
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know that the Bilderberg group,</v>

2846
02:16:39.860 --> 02:16:43.630
<v Speaker 1>those are real meetings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know that the federal bank.</v>

2847
02:16:43.870 --> 02:16:46.720
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>W We know how that works.</v>

2848
02:16:46.990 --> 02:16:48.750
<v Speaker 1>We know that the federal bank isn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>bank.</v>

2849
02:16:48.840 --> 02:16:53.840
<v Speaker 1>It's not federal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just it's a privately owned </v>

2850
02:16:53.840 --> 02:16:56.641
<v Speaker 1>company.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know that international banks and as </v>

2851
02:16:56.641 --> 02:17:01.340
<v Speaker 1>well as well as the banks in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>country have all done all sorts of </v>

2852
02:17:01.340 --> 02:17:04.291
<v Speaker 1>horrible shit involving laundering money</v>
<v Speaker 1>and gotten little slaps on the wrist and</v>

2853
02:17:04.510 --> 02:17:07.810
<v Speaker 1>a little baby fines and when they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>about to fall apart,</v>

2854
02:17:08.050 --> 02:17:12.700
<v Speaker 1>our own tax dollars are used to step in </v>
<v Speaker 1>and save these fuckheads.</v>

2855
02:17:13.840 --> 02:17:16.270
<v Speaker 1>We all know all that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yet we all know that.</v>

2856
02:17:16.280 --> 02:17:17.550
<v Speaker 1>We just sort of accept it.</v>

2857
02:17:19.060 --> 02:17:21.550
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Kennedy shot in broad daylight.</v>

2858
02:17:23.730 --> 02:17:28.730
<v Speaker 1>There's so much of what it is to be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>person that runs a government that no </v>

2859
02:17:30.601 --> 02:17:33.420
<v Speaker 1>one other than that person or those </v>
<v Speaker 1>people is ever going to understand.</v>

2860
02:17:34.170 --> 02:17:39.170
<v Speaker 1>I think it's probably like a helpless </v>
<v Speaker 1>position where you realize once you get </v>

2861
02:17:39.170 --> 02:17:39.330
<v Speaker 1>there like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh God,</v>

2862
02:17:39.331 --> 02:17:40.410
<v Speaker 1>this isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody does this.</v>

2863
02:17:40.411 --> 02:17:41.310
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can't be done.</v>

2864
02:17:41.311 --> 02:17:42.020
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2865
02:17:42.080 --> 02:17:47.080
<v Speaker 1>Literally can't be done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to try to do my best to get </v>

2866
02:17:47.080 --> 02:17:47.080
<v Speaker 1>some healthcare pushed through some </v>
<v Speaker 1>other,</v>

2867
02:17:47.080 --> 02:17:48.630
<v Speaker 1>some other things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe gay marriage,</v>

2868
02:17:49.740 --> 02:17:52.020
<v Speaker 1>gay marriage on the books.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck Yeah,</v>

2869
02:17:52.021 --> 02:17:53.910
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that guy's having a great week.</v>

2870
02:17:55.100 --> 02:17:56.610
<v Speaker 1>Great Week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He really is.</v>

2871
02:17:56.760 --> 02:17:57.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2872
02:17:57.280 --> 02:17:58.280
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2873
02:17:58.290 --> 02:17:59.940
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't know.</v>

2874
02:18:00.120 --> 02:18:05.120
<v Speaker 1>That is the belief that the president </v>
<v Speaker 1>has a kind of hapless victim that gets </v>

2875
02:18:06.301 --> 02:18:11.301
<v Speaker 1>pulled into a web of darkness and does </v>
<v Speaker 1>the best that he can do is certainly </v>

2876
02:18:11.301 --> 02:18:14.220
<v Speaker 1>more comforting than the other version </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the story,</v>

2877
02:18:14.221 --> 02:18:19.221
<v Speaker 1>which is that it's just somebody who's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>narcissist to trick themselves into </v>

2878
02:18:19.221 --> 02:18:22.611
<v Speaker 1>thinking they were some capital is Jesus</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they're going to walk across </v>

2879
02:18:22.611 --> 02:18:27.171
<v Speaker 1>the stage of history and create </v>
<v Speaker 1>incredible changes for the better in the</v>

2880
02:18:27.241 --> 02:18:31.020
<v Speaker 1>world while hoping to God that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people you're creating the changes for.</v>

2881
02:18:31.020 --> 02:18:36.020
<v Speaker 1>We'll forget about the countless </v>
<v Speaker 1>children you've transformed into </v>

2882
02:18:36.020 --> 02:18:36.020
<v Speaker 1>hamburger meat</v>

2883
02:18:36.020 --> 02:18:40.160
<v Speaker 7>from dropping bombs at a drop drawings </v>
<v Speaker 7>on top of them accidentally and they we </v>

2884
02:18:40.251 --> 02:18:42.750
<v Speaker 7>do because maybe it is a game.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You start thinking,</v>

2885
02:18:42.751 --> 02:18:47.751
<v Speaker 7>is it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>This is like a game of thrones style </v>

2886
02:18:47.751 --> 02:18:49.611
<v Speaker 7>universe where you know every decision </v>
<v Speaker 7>that you make are five percent of the </v>

2887
02:18:49.611 --> 02:18:54.261
<v Speaker 7>decisions you make are going to result </v>
<v Speaker 7>in someone dying and someone not dying </v>

2888
02:18:54.261 --> 02:18:55.530
<v Speaker 7>and you're forced into the predicament </v>
<v Speaker 7>of saying,</v>

2889
02:18:55.531 --> 02:19:00.531
<v Speaker 7>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I guess if I have to pick between dying </v>

2890
02:19:00.531 --> 02:19:02.901
<v Speaker 7>and not dying,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm going to pick people from the </v>

2891
02:19:02.901 --> 02:19:04.731
<v Speaker 7>country.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm currently the president of over the </v>

2892
02:19:04.731 --> 02:19:04.900
<v Speaker 7>people from the country.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm not the president of.</v>

2893
02:19:04.920 --> 02:19:09.920
<v Speaker 7>That's going to be the decision I have </v>
<v Speaker 7>to make because that's the oath that </v>

2894
02:19:09.920 --> 02:19:10.800
<v Speaker 7>I've sworn.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So yeah,</v>

2895
02:19:10.801 --> 02:19:15.801
<v Speaker 7>from time to time I'm going to,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm going to explode some fucking kids </v>

2896
02:19:15.801 --> 02:19:19.400
<v Speaker 7>and I'm also gonna get gay marriage </v>
<v Speaker 7>legalized and I'm also going to help </v>

2897
02:19:19.400 --> 02:19:22.540
<v Speaker 7>ease the prohibition on marijuana and </v>
<v Speaker 7>then once a month while</v>

2920
02:20:17.350 --> 02:20:21.491
<v Speaker 1>him at ease,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like how Obama was really good at </v>

<v Speaker 1>putting him at ease,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's his podcast,</v>

<v Speaker 1>could hear him at the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like most people,</v>

2925
02:20:29.691 --> 02:20:34.691

<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't use the fucking president </v>

2926
02:20:34.691 --> 02:20:34.691

<v Speaker 1>garbage bags because there was a sight </v>

2929
02:20:42.550 --> 02:20:44.030
<v Speaker 1>line where there could have been a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sniper on a roof.</v>

02:20:44.031 --> 02:20:46.460
<v Speaker 1>There's a sniper on the roof of his </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking house.</v>

2931
02:20:46.461 --> 02:20:48.560
<v Speaker 1>Man in his intro,</v>

<v Speaker 1>there's a sniper up my roof.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My neighbors hate me.</v>

<v Speaker 1>What did he just do it at a place where </v>

2936
02:21:00.881 --> 02:21:01.190
<v Speaker 1>they can secure it gets bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's bad.</v>

2937
02:21:01.191 --> 02:21:03.210
<v Speaker 1>It's a bad ass decision because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>about us.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Mark Marin Morris fucking flannel in the</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

2946
02:21:19.310 --> 02:21:20.960
<v Speaker 1>that is his attire though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's his outfit.</v>

2947
02:21:20.961 --> 02:21:22.670
<v Speaker 1>Much like you're a bishop and I'm a NASA</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy.</v>

2948
02:21:22.700 --> 02:21:26.060
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will think about what you said.</v>

2949
02:21:26.061 --> 02:21:28.910
<v Speaker 1>He wore his flannel so he puts his out </v>
<v Speaker 1>sake.</v>

2950
02:21:29.020 --> 02:21:31.940
<v Speaker 1>You were like a grateful dead tee shirt </v>
<v Speaker 1>or a fucking wife.</v>

2951
02:21:31.941 --> 02:21:33.320
<v Speaker 1>But a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>

2952
02:21:33.321 --> 02:21:35.150
<v Speaker 1>I'm in the president,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to present to the president,</v>

2953
02:21:35.151 --> 02:21:38.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to wear a Tuxedo or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that dresses in his normal attire.</v>

2954
02:21:38.960 --> 02:21:40.670
<v Speaker 1>That was pretty cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

2955
02:21:40.671 --> 02:21:43.370
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the interview itself was really great.</v>

2956
02:21:43.371 --> 02:21:48.371
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like Obama was very funny and </v>

2957
02:21:48.371 --> 02:21:51.071
<v Speaker 1>they were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like they're great funny moments </v>

2958
02:21:51.071 --> 02:21:52.961
<v Speaker 1>and that one of my favorite lines in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>interview was a Obama like mentions like</v>

2959
02:21:55.280 --> 02:21:57.860
<v Speaker 1>Mark Marin mentions black helicopters </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's like,</v>

2960
02:21:57.890 --> 02:21:59.490
<v Speaker 1>but there's no black helicopters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2961
02:21:59.910 --> 02:22:01.730
<v Speaker 1>And Obama was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are black helicopters,</v>

2962
02:22:02.420 --> 02:22:05.960
<v Speaker 1>they just are in other countries more </v>
<v Speaker 1>than we use them here.</v>

2963
02:22:06.230 --> 02:22:07.790
<v Speaker 1>But he did say they're black </v>
<v Speaker 1>helicopters.</v>

2964
02:22:07.791 --> 02:22:10.430
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of everybody knows that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>know.</v>

2965
02:22:10.431 --> 02:22:15.431
<v Speaker 1>But it was a funny thing for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>president to hear it out of the </v>

2966
02:22:15.431 --> 02:22:15.431
<v Speaker 1>president's mouth and it kind of funny </v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

2967
02:22:15.431 --> 02:22:16.190
<v Speaker 1>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2968
02:22:16.490 --> 02:22:21.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>outside of the how incredibly </v>

2969
02:22:21.490 --> 02:22:23.411
<v Speaker 1>charismatic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>affable and how grateful I am to a lot </v>

2970
02:22:23.411 --> 02:22:25.140
<v Speaker 1>of the shit the Obama administration has</v>
<v Speaker 1>done healthcare.</v>

2971
02:22:25.280 --> 02:22:25.980
<v Speaker 1>And I know a lot</v>

2972
02:22:25.980 --> 02:22:27.930
<v Speaker 3>of people out there fucking hate what </v>
<v Speaker 3>he's done.</v>

2973
02:22:28.200 --> 02:22:33.200
<v Speaker 3>But as somebody who has had cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>knowing that if I wanted to get </v>

2974
02:22:33.200 --> 02:22:36.861
<v Speaker 3>insurance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if my insurance lapsed or something and </v>

2975
02:22:36.861 --> 02:22:37.470
<v Speaker 3>they're not going to do what they </v>
<v Speaker 3>usually do,</v>

2976
02:22:37.471 --> 02:22:39.170
<v Speaker 3>which is a uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2977
02:22:39.180 --> 02:22:42.540
<v Speaker 3>they would investigate you before you </v>
<v Speaker 3>couldn't get insurance for days and days</v>

2978
02:22:42.541 --> 02:22:47.541
<v Speaker 3>and days.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They would investigate you to find out </v>

2979
02:22:47.541 --> 02:22:49.431
<v Speaker 3>if you have previous health conditions </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you couldn't get insurance so you'd </v>

2980
02:22:49.431 --> 02:22:49.431
<v Speaker 3>have to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2981
02:22:49.431 --> 02:22:50.480
<v Speaker 3>you could die or you get shitty </v>
<v Speaker 3>healthcare.</v>

2982
02:22:50.790 --> 02:22:55.790
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's cool to know that a lot of people </v>

2983
02:22:55.790 --> 02:22:55.790
<v Speaker 3>don't have to deal with that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's cool.</v>

2984
02:22:55.790 --> 02:22:58.140
<v Speaker 3>I know it's not a perfect system and </v>
<v Speaker 3>from a libertarian perspective,</v>

2985
02:22:58.141 --> 02:23:03.141
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know a lot of you probably have good </v>

2986
02:23:03.141 --> 02:23:04.761
<v Speaker 3>reasons to really hate it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think there's a lot of good </v>

2987
02:23:04.761 --> 02:23:04.761
<v Speaker 3>reasons to not hit it too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm grateful for that.</v>

2988
02:23:04.761 --> 02:23:09.300
<v Speaker 3>Marijuana seems to be becoming legal </v>
<v Speaker 3>during his administration,</v>

2989
02:23:09.301 --> 02:23:14.301
<v Speaker 3>even though his administration has done </v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of shit to obstruct research on </v>

2990
02:23:14.551 --> 02:23:16.050
<v Speaker 3>marijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 3>things seemed to be changing.</v>

2991
02:23:16.410 --> 02:23:19.470
<v Speaker 3>Gay Marriage is now legal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's under his administration.</v>

2992
02:23:19.680 --> 02:23:22.170
<v Speaker 3>All those things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The whistleblower stole that Shit.</v>

2993
02:23:22.290 --> 02:23:23.910
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the shit that bugs me,</v>

2994
02:23:23.911 --> 02:23:25.230
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And asked him about that.</v>

2995
02:23:26.100 --> 02:23:27.170
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so.</v>

2996
02:23:27.171 --> 02:23:28.230
<v Speaker 3>I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I actually,</v>

2997
02:23:28.231 --> 02:23:28.920
<v Speaker 3>I had to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't.</v>

2998
02:23:28.921 --> 02:23:29.730
<v Speaker 3>I was listening to you.</v>

2999
02:23:30.200 --> 02:23:35.200
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll have to listen to it to see if he </v>

3000
02:23:35.200 --> 02:23:36.701
<v Speaker 5>did because that's super important </v>
<v Speaker 5>subject and the idea that someone who's </v>

3001
02:23:37.761 --> 02:23:42.761
<v Speaker 5>doing what they think is the right thing</v>
<v Speaker 5>for humanity by expressing they have a </v>

3002
02:23:43.491 --> 02:23:46.520
<v Speaker 5>huge issue with the legality of certain </v>
<v Speaker 5>actions that are,</v>

3003
02:23:46.610 --> 02:23:49.430
<v Speaker 5>that are commonplace.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's fucked mean he seen,</v>

3004
02:23:49.460 --> 02:23:54.460
<v Speaker 5>he seen these things happen on a daily </v>
<v Speaker 5>basis and he thinks they're </v>

3005
02:23:54.460 --> 02:23:55.010
<v Speaker 5>unconstitutional and now he's hiding in </v>
<v Speaker 5>Russia,</v>

3006
02:23:55.860 --> 02:23:57.150
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>than how.</v>

3007
02:23:57.420 --> 02:23:58.710
<v Speaker 3>How crazy is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>To me,</v>

3008
02:23:58.711 --> 02:24:03.711
<v Speaker 3>this is where you get into this problem </v>
<v Speaker 3>with presidents were and they kind of </v>

3009
02:24:03.711 --> 02:24:05.520
<v Speaker 3>remind you of like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh fucking uncle,</v>

<v Speaker 3>You'll either that or he's like </v>

3015
02:24:21.050 --> 02:24:23.130
<v Speaker 3>molesting someone and you're supposed to</v>
<v Speaker 3>ignore the fact.</v>

3016
02:24:23.131 --> 02:24:28.131
<v Speaker 3>This is in families where I actually was</v>
<v Speaker 3>listening to this great documentary on </v>

3017
02:24:29.101 --> 02:24:34.101
<v Speaker 3>npr about the phenomena of why that kind</v>
<v Speaker 3>of shit is sexual abuse will happen in a</v>

3018
02:24:35.461 --> 02:24:40.461
<v Speaker 3>family and keep happening in a family </v>
<v Speaker 3>because to acknowledge it is to implode </v>

3019
02:24:41.041 --> 02:24:45.600
<v Speaker 3>the family to acknowledge it is to that </v>
<v Speaker 3>family is done and it happened.</v>

3020
02:24:45.810 --> 02:24:47.030
<v Speaker 3>This is when those.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

3021
02:24:47.031 --> 02:24:50.160
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't following the newest thing that</v>

3022
02:24:50.161 --> 02:24:55.161
<v Speaker 3>happened when that weird religious group</v>
<v Speaker 3>of people where there was sexual abuse </v>

3023
02:24:55.161 --> 02:24:55.161
<v Speaker 3>that happened.</v>

3024
02:24:55.161 --> 02:24:56.160
<v Speaker 3>I can't even remember their names.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's in relation to that,</v>

3025
02:24:56.161 --> 02:24:57.720
<v Speaker 3>but the doers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3026
02:24:58.110 --> 02:25:01.500
<v Speaker 3>So the Duggar's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you in a family,</v>

3027
02:25:01.501 --> 02:25:03.420
<v Speaker 3>if you like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>admit that this is happening,</v>

3028
02:25:03.990 --> 02:25:05.820
<v Speaker 3>father,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mother,</v>

3029
02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:07.710
<v Speaker 3>uncle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whoever is doing this thing,</v>

3030
02:25:07.711 --> 02:25:10.440
<v Speaker 3>you will transform the terrain of that </v>
<v Speaker 3>family permanently.</v>

3031
02:25:10.441 --> 02:25:12.000
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So in the same way with,</v>

3032
02:25:12.080 --> 02:25:14.370
<v Speaker 3>with the president,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3033
02:25:14.371 --> 02:25:19.371
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're almost being asked to do the same </v>

3034
02:25:19.371 --> 02:25:20.130
<v Speaker 3>exact thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is like take the good.</v>

3035
02:25:20.400 --> 02:25:23.920
<v Speaker 3>He makes great hamburgers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he gives the gate candy.</v>

3036
02:25:24.070 --> 02:25:26.860
<v Speaker 3>He's like really fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's got a slip and slide,</v>

3037
02:25:27.070 --> 02:25:29.050
<v Speaker 3>but for God's sake,</v>
<v Speaker 3>never mentioned the time.</v>

3038
02:25:29.080 --> 02:25:32.560
<v Speaker 3>Two years ago when you were standing </v>
<v Speaker 3>behind the tool shed,</v>

3039
02:25:32.561 --> 02:25:35.440
<v Speaker 3>he slid his finger into your asshole </v>
<v Speaker 3>because if you do that,</v>

3040
02:25:35.730 --> 02:25:40.730
<v Speaker 3>it's fucking ruined our family in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>same way we would with like that with </v>

3041
02:25:41.801 --> 02:25:42.700
<v Speaker 3>Obama.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Man.</v>

3042
02:25:42.730 --> 02:25:46.000
<v Speaker 3>You're not supposed to you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just are like,</v>

3043
02:25:46.001 --> 02:25:51.001
<v Speaker 3>all right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just ignore the fact that right now </v>

3044
02:25:51.001 --> 02:25:54.001
<v Speaker 3>we're dealing with for profit prisons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the greatest heroes of our time,</v>

3045
02:25:54.501 --> 02:25:59.501
<v Speaker 3>snowden was a real patriot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is having to hide in fucking Russia </v>

3046
02:25:59.891 --> 02:26:02.470
<v Speaker 3>right now because we were supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 3>ignore the fact.</v>

3047
02:26:02.500 --> 02:26:07.500
<v Speaker 3>Even if Obama can't change it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can he come out at a press conference </v>

3048
02:26:07.500 --> 02:26:10.570
<v Speaker 3>and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I support and endorse what snowden did.</v>

3049
02:26:10.580 --> 02:26:10.770
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I</v>

3050
02:26:10.810 --> 02:26:15.810
<v Speaker 6>can't say that because then people will </v>
<v Speaker 6>be able to just hack into anything they </v>

3051
02:26:15.810 --> 02:26:20.581
<v Speaker 6>want and take information that the </v>
<v Speaker 6>government has distributed all around </v>

3058
02:26:37.121 --> 02:26:39.010
<v Speaker 6>but and you literally are playing </v>
<v Speaker 6>devil's advocate,</v>

3059
02:26:39.011 --> 02:26:44.011
<v Speaker 6>but I don't mean to.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't mean to like get all </v>

3060
02:26:44.011 --> 02:26:47.071
<v Speaker 6>constitutional and everything,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but isn't the point of the president to </v>

3061
02:26:47.071 --> 02:26:51.750
<v Speaker 6>uphold the constitution and isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I don't think the constitution </v>

3062
02:26:51.750 --> 02:26:56.050
<v Speaker 6>existed when it was created with the </v>
<v Speaker 6>understanding of the Internet,</v>

3063
02:26:56.350 --> 02:26:58.540
<v Speaker 6>with the understanding of the </v>
<v Speaker 6>distribution of information,</v>

3064
02:26:58.541 --> 02:27:00.700
<v Speaker 6>with the understanding of covert </v>
<v Speaker 6>intelligence,</v>

3065
02:27:00.701 --> 02:27:05.701
<v Speaker 6>with the understanding of terrorism,</v>
<v Speaker 6>with the understanding of a lot of </v>

3066
02:27:05.701 --> 02:27:05.701
<v Speaker 6>things.</v>

3067
02:27:05.701 --> 02:27:08.050
<v Speaker 6>I think that was a real problem was that</v>
<v Speaker 6>first of all,</v>

3068
02:27:08.051 --> 02:27:13.051
<v Speaker 6>when,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when he did tell everybody that the NSA </v>

3069
02:27:13.051 --> 02:27:13.420
<v Speaker 6>spying on every fucking American on the </v>
<v Speaker 6>planet,</v>

3070
02:27:14.020 --> 02:27:15.290
<v Speaker 6>they lied.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

3071
02:27:15.430 --> 02:27:17.830
<v Speaker 6>That's bad.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's a huge problem.</v>

3072
02:27:17.831 --> 02:27:20.140
<v Speaker 6>That's one problem.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And second of all,</v>

3073
02:27:20.141 --> 02:27:25.141
<v Speaker 6>there's no rational justification.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There was no significant number of </v>

3074
02:27:25.141 --> 02:27:25.170
<v Speaker 6>terrorism events.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They've.</v>

3075
02:27:25.480 --> 02:27:29.800
<v Speaker 6>They've stopped it while compromising </v>
<v Speaker 6>the privacy of everybody.</v>

3076
02:27:30.250 --> 02:27:35.250
<v Speaker 6>Then they started talking about how I </v>
<v Speaker 6>was just metadata and that wasn't true </v>

3077
02:27:35.250 --> 02:27:35.250
<v Speaker 6>either.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's not just metadata.</v>

3078
02:27:35.250 --> 02:27:39.331
<v Speaker 6>People were going into the the emails of</v>
<v Speaker 6>their ex boyfriends and girlfriends and </v>

3079
02:27:39.760 --> 02:27:43.360
<v Speaker 6>reading their shit and downloading </v>
<v Speaker 6>pictures on their computers.</v>

3080
02:27:43.510 --> 02:27:48.510
<v Speaker 6>They're doing whatever the fuck they </v>
<v Speaker 6>wanted to do and they can do whatever </v>

3081
02:27:48.510 --> 02:27:48.510
<v Speaker 6>the fuck they want to do because they </v>
<v Speaker 6>have this autonomy.</v>

3082
02:27:48.510 --> 02:27:49.990
<v Speaker 6>They have this power working for the </v>
<v Speaker 6>NSA,</v>

3083
02:27:49.991 --> 02:27:51.820
<v Speaker 6>but what he was saying was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he was like,</v>

3084
02:27:51.821 --> 02:27:56.821
<v Speaker 6>I didn't even graduate from college,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and he goes and I have access to all </v>

3085
02:27:56.821 --> 02:27:57.820
<v Speaker 6>this stuff and I'm just a normal person.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm around a bunch of other people.</v>

3086
02:27:57.821 --> 02:27:59.590
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and I got this information.</v>

3087
02:27:59.591 --> 02:28:01.780
<v Speaker 6>I leak.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I got this information out to people.</v>

3088
02:28:01.960 --> 02:28:04.540
<v Speaker 6>What's the stop all these other people </v>
<v Speaker 6>from taking information.</v>

3089
02:28:04.840 --> 02:28:09.840
<v Speaker 6>What's to stop them from sharing it with</v>
<v Speaker 6>each other and passing it back and </v>

3090
02:28:09.840 --> 02:28:09.840
<v Speaker 6>forth?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Nothing.</v>

3091
02:28:09.840 --> 02:28:14.640
<v Speaker 6>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Obviously if he was he able to leak as </v>

3092
02:28:14.640 --> 02:28:14.640
<v Speaker 6>much as he leaked.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What?</v>

3093
02:28:14.640 --> 02:28:19.070
<v Speaker 6>What?</v>
<v Speaker 6>What safeguards are in place for </v>

3094
02:28:19.070 --> 02:28:21.541
<v Speaker 6>People's privacy?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Believe very little and whether or not </v>

3095
02:28:21.541 --> 02:28:22.040
<v Speaker 6>you're doing anything wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 6>whether or not you need to</v>

3096
02:28:22.040 --> 02:28:24.110
<v Speaker 4>worry about it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's not the argument.</v>

3097
02:28:24.290 --> 02:28:29.290
<v Speaker 4>The argument is it fundamentally changes</v>
<v Speaker 4>the relationship that you have with </v>

3098
02:28:29.290 --> 02:28:32.771
<v Speaker 4>another person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The same way being a cop changes the </v>

3099
02:28:32.771 --> 02:28:35.201
<v Speaker 4>relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you're talking to someone that you </v>

3100
02:28:35.201 --> 02:28:35.480
<v Speaker 4>think is committing a crime,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all of a sudden you have power over that</v>

3101
02:28:35.481 --> 02:28:37.670
<v Speaker 4>person's information.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't have any over.</v>

3102
02:28:37.740 --> 02:28:40.310
<v Speaker 4>You could say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sit down,</v>

3103
02:28:40.400 --> 02:28:42.470
<v Speaker 4>put your fucking hands over your head.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You'd be like,</v>

3104
02:28:42.471 --> 02:28:43.160
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck you.</v>

3105
02:28:43.161 --> 02:28:47.900
<v Speaker 4>You sit down stupid fucking tumble and </v>
<v Speaker 4>your role with your stupid uniform on.</v>

3106
02:28:47.901 --> 02:28:52.901
<v Speaker 4>Don't put a point a gun at me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I need to sit down because you're </v>

3107
02:28:52.901 --> 02:28:55.331
<v Speaker 4>pointing a gun at me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're an asshole or you need to put </v>

3108
02:28:55.331 --> 02:28:58.661
<v Speaker 4>your hands behind your back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to handcuff you because I </v>

3109
02:28:58.661 --> 02:28:58.661
<v Speaker 4>don't trust you pointing a gun at me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Pay Your bills,</v>

3110
02:28:58.661 --> 02:29:02.951
<v Speaker 4>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I pay your bills and you're pointing a </v>

3111
02:29:02.951 --> 02:29:02.951
<v Speaker 4>gun at me or my daughter.</v>

3112
02:29:02.951 --> 02:29:02.951
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but no one is going to accept that.</v>

3113
02:29:02.951 --> 02:29:03.830
<v Speaker 4>No one's going to accept that you're not</v>
<v Speaker 4>gonna.</v>

3114
02:29:03.831 --> 02:29:08.420
<v Speaker 4>Accept that because a cop thinks he's a </v>
<v Speaker 4>cop and it's similar in a lot of ways.</v>

3115
02:29:08.750 --> 02:29:13.750
<v Speaker 4>It's similar.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The idea that someone has access to </v>

3116
02:29:13.750 --> 02:29:13.750
<v Speaker 4>Duncan trussell's email,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you don't have access to.</v>

3117
02:29:13.750 --> 02:29:18.131
<v Speaker 4>There's no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't even know they're there </v>

3118
02:29:18.131 --> 02:29:20.080
<v Speaker 4>checking in on you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have power over you and observing </v>

3119
02:29:20.080 --> 02:29:20.080
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>making sure you don't fuck up.</v>

3120
02:29:20.120 --> 02:29:21.260
<v Speaker 4>Guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just like how,</v>

3121
02:29:21.280 --> 02:29:22.670
<v Speaker 4>when you're talking about those,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3122
02:29:22.671 --> 02:29:27.671
<v Speaker 4>those experiments that they do on </v>
<v Speaker 4>subatomic particles and waves and other </v>

3123
02:29:27.671 --> 02:29:29.450
<v Speaker 4>quantum shit with the observer changes </v>
<v Speaker 4>the effect.</v>

3124
02:29:29.990 --> 02:29:34.990
<v Speaker 4>Guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you fucking follow someone around </v>

3125
02:29:34.990 --> 02:29:34.990
<v Speaker 4>and observed the shit out of 'em,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3126
02:29:34.990 --> 02:29:38.711
<v Speaker 4>changes them and changes them similar to</v>
<v Speaker 4>that stupid double blind double slit </v>

3127
02:29:39.561 --> 02:29:42.650
<v Speaker 4>experiment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a wave and it's a particle.</v>

3128
02:29:42.770 --> 02:29:45.030
<v Speaker 4>You're innocent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you're also a criminal for diff.</v>

3129
02:29:45.530 --> 02:29:48.230
<v Speaker 4>Constantly following you trying to look </v>
<v Speaker 4>yet changes.</v>

3130
02:29:48.231 --> 02:29:53.231
<v Speaker 4>You fucking changes the way you feel if </v>
<v Speaker 4>someone's hounding you and fucking with </v>

3131
02:29:53.231 --> 02:29:53.570
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It changes you.</v>

3132
02:29:54.090 --> 02:29:54.980
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

3133
02:29:55.220 --> 02:29:56.120
<v Speaker 4>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3134
02:29:56.121 --> 02:29:57.200
<v Speaker 4>that didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3135
02:29:57.201 --> 02:29:58.520
<v Speaker 4>that's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

3136
02:29:58.700 --> 02:30:01.540
<v Speaker 4>it's such a confused.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's such a confusing thing to hear.</v>

3137
02:30:01.570 --> 02:30:03.530
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I hear such an affable,</v>

3138
02:30:03.531 --> 02:30:08.531
<v Speaker 4>cool guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>done some really great things and to </v>

3139
02:30:08.531 --> 02:30:10.070
<v Speaker 4>know that this other shit is going on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just kinda sad man.</v>

3140
02:30:10.071 --> 02:30:12.020
<v Speaker 4>It'd be so beautiful if,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3141
02:30:12.480 --> 02:30:13.950
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>

3142
02:30:14.110 --> 02:30:17.030
<v Speaker 4>he had actually shut down Guantanamo,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the,</v>

3143
02:30:17.600 --> 02:30:18.260
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3144
02:30:18.380 --> 02:30:22.420
<v Speaker 4>staff coming back about either treating </v>
<v Speaker 4>those poor bastards like raw,</v>

3145
02:30:22.550 --> 02:30:27.550
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're just like force feeding them </v>

3146
02:30:27.550 --> 02:30:27.550
<v Speaker 4>even though they want to die so they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>not even letting them die.</v>

3147
02:30:27.550 --> 02:30:30.810
<v Speaker 4>They're keeping them alive like </v>
<v Speaker 4>something from the hellraiser dimension,</v>

3148
02:30:30.840 --> 02:30:35.570
<v Speaker 4>just shoving tubes into their throat and</v>
<v Speaker 4>putting protein gel into their bellies.</v>

3149
02:30:35.840 --> 02:30:40.840
<v Speaker 4>And a lot of these guys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure some of them are not great </v>

3150
02:30:40.840 --> 02:30:41.780
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think a lot of them are probably,</v>

3151
02:30:42.020 --> 02:30:43.820
<v Speaker 4>they haven't even been given a trial.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3152
02:30:43.930 --> 02:30:48.350
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of them that got </v>
<v Speaker 4>interested in alternative ways to govern</v>

3153
02:30:48.351 --> 02:30:53.351
<v Speaker 4>and live lives and alternative </v>
<v Speaker 4>philosophies and religions and our </v>

3154
02:30:53.351 --> 02:30:57.710
<v Speaker 4>alternative ideologies and maybe even </v>
<v Speaker 4>militant ideologies that were curious.</v>

3155
02:30:57.740 --> 02:31:02.740
<v Speaker 4>They were curious about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't mean that they've committed </v>

3156
02:31:02.740 --> 02:31:02.740
<v Speaker 4>any crimes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Doesn't mean that they've.</v>

3157
02:31:02.740 --> 02:31:03.620
<v Speaker 4>I mean they might be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they might not be.</v>

3158
02:31:03.980 --> 02:31:08.980
<v Speaker 4>But the idea that all you have to do is </v>
<v Speaker 4>just be interested in these things and </v>

3159
02:31:08.980 --> 02:31:11.030
<v Speaker 4>they can lock you out a lock you up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's there's a thought crime aspect to</v>

3160
02:31:11.031 --> 02:31:12.050
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's really scary.</v>

3161
02:31:12.080 --> 02:31:13.220
<v Speaker 4>We got to hold.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The thing is,</v>

3162
02:31:13.250 --> 02:31:14.630
<v Speaker 4>God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this sounds so cliche,</v>

3163
02:31:14.631 --> 02:31:16.640
<v Speaker 4>but you gotta hold your leaders </v>
<v Speaker 4>accountable.</v>

3164
02:31:16.641 --> 02:31:19.710
<v Speaker 4>You must hold leaders accountable and we</v>
<v Speaker 4>haven't doing it.</v>

3165
02:31:19.890 --> 02:31:20.070
<v Speaker 4>It</v>

3166
02:31:20.070 --> 02:31:22.530
<v Speaker 7>doesn't happen and because it doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 7>happen,</v>

3167
02:31:22.770 --> 02:31:26.610
<v Speaker 7>they keep taking more liberties and the </v>
<v Speaker 7>problem is we don't know how to hold our</v>

3168
02:31:26.611 --> 02:31:29.130
<v Speaker 7>leaders accountable because they're in </v>
<v Speaker 7>charge of everything.</v>

3169
02:31:29.131 --> 02:31:34.131
<v Speaker 7>So that's the predicament outside of </v>
<v Speaker 7>holding them accountable by voting or </v>

3170
02:31:34.131 --> 02:31:34.200
<v Speaker 7>hold the,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3171
02:31:34.201 --> 02:31:37.470
<v Speaker 7>that's one way to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but it's a really confusing,</v>

3172
02:31:37.770 --> 02:31:38.310
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>again,</v>

3173
02:31:38.311 --> 02:31:40.710
<v Speaker 7>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you hear the term war criminal thrown in</v>

3174
02:31:40.711 --> 02:31:44.550
<v Speaker 7>the direction of the Bush administration</v>
<v Speaker 7>and you know,</v>

3175
02:31:44.600 --> 02:31:49.600
<v Speaker 7>I don't know if it's true or not,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but I know there's never going to be a </v>

3176
02:31:49.600 --> 02:31:52.371
<v Speaker 7>trial.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I know that there's never going to be </v>

3177
02:31:52.371 --> 02:31:52.371
<v Speaker 7>any,</v>
<v Speaker 7>anything,</v>

3178
02:31:52.371 --> 02:31:55.611
<v Speaker 7>even close to a real investigation into </v>
<v Speaker 7>why we went to war there and what we did</v>

3179
02:31:56.761 --> 02:32:01.761
<v Speaker 7>while we were there and all that shit </v>
<v Speaker 7>just kind of gets swept down the river </v>

3180
02:32:01.761 --> 02:32:05.961
<v Speaker 7>of history and you're invited to ignore </v>
<v Speaker 7>it and look in the direction of the </v>

3181
02:32:06.180 --> 02:32:08.820
<v Speaker 7>progressive things that are happening </v>
<v Speaker 7>and they're great,</v>

3182
02:32:09.060 --> 02:32:14.060
<v Speaker 7>but then because great things are </v>
<v Speaker 7>happening does not mean that you ignore </v>

3183
02:32:14.191 --> 02:32:19.191
<v Speaker 7>all the other dark shit that's happening</v>
<v Speaker 7>and it doesn't mean that you're being a </v>

3184
02:32:19.191 --> 02:32:22.371
<v Speaker 7>conspiracy theorist or negative or </v>
<v Speaker 7>pessimistic because you won't let go of </v>

3185
02:32:23.041 --> 02:32:28.041
<v Speaker 7>the fact that the last few presidents </v>
<v Speaker 7>who've maybe done some shit that is,</v>

3186
02:32:29.460 --> 02:32:34.460
<v Speaker 7>seems to go directly against the rules </v>
<v Speaker 7>that were written down and whatever this</v>

3187
02:32:34.630 --> 02:32:36.900
<v Speaker 7>current game of being an American is.</v>

3188
02:32:37.170 --> 02:32:40.020
<v Speaker 7>And everybody's got to be held to those </v>
<v Speaker 7>rules.</v>

3189
02:32:40.021 --> 02:32:44.250
<v Speaker 7>If everyone's not held to those rules,</v>
<v Speaker 7>then we're all supposed to either wander</v>

3190
02:32:44.251 --> 02:32:48.780
<v Speaker 7>around in a state of denial and pretend </v>
<v Speaker 7>that everything's cool and it isn't.</v>

3191
02:32:49.020 --> 02:32:50.850
<v Speaker 7>Or we have to like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't know.</v>

3192
02:32:50.851 --> 02:32:51.090
<v Speaker 7>What</v>

3193
02:32:51.350 --> 02:32:52.250
<v Speaker 6>did you hear about this?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

3194
02:32:52.320 --> 02:32:54.350
<v Speaker 6>there's a great article that I tweeted </v>
<v Speaker 6>yesterday,</v>

3195
02:32:54.351 --> 02:32:58.970
<v Speaker 6>Isis and the lonely young American,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's about this girl who's a 23 year old</v>

3196
02:32:59.180 --> 02:33:03.620
<v Speaker 6>Sunday school teacher and a babysitter </v>
<v Speaker 6>and she was a,</v>

3197
02:33:03.650 --> 02:33:06.320
<v Speaker 6>she converted to Islam.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She was lonely.</v>

3198
02:33:06.350 --> 02:33:11.350
<v Speaker 6>She was living with her grandparents.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She converted to Islam and it goes over </v>

3199
02:33:11.350 --> 02:33:14.291
<v Speaker 6>this long slow sort of story where it's </v>
<v Speaker 6>just like you,</v>

3200
02:33:14.711 --> 02:33:19.711
<v Speaker 6>you understand like who she is and how </v>
<v Speaker 6>she got sucked in and she fucking joins </v>

3201
02:33:19.711 --> 02:33:21.650
<v Speaker 6>isis.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Isis like offers her like some,</v>

3202
02:33:21.740 --> 02:33:26.740
<v Speaker 6>some feeling of belonging and she,</v>
<v Speaker 6>she goes through this process to join </v>

3203
02:33:26.740 --> 02:33:27.770
<v Speaker 6>isis.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't want to tell you any more of it.</v>

3204
02:33:27.771 --> 02:33:30.600
<v Speaker 6>I just want people to read it because </v>
<v Speaker 6>it's really fascinating and it's,</v>

3205
02:33:30.640 --> 02:33:34.280
<v Speaker 6>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It also highlights an aspect of adhering</v>

3206
02:33:34.281 --> 02:33:39.281
<v Speaker 6>to ideologies that a lot of people don't</v>
<v Speaker 6>want to admit is that people are </v>

3207
02:33:39.281 --> 02:33:39.920
<v Speaker 6>extremely vulnerable because we don't </v>
<v Speaker 6>want to be alone.</v>

3208
02:33:40.310 --> 02:33:45.310
<v Speaker 6>And a lot of times when you see someone </v>
<v Speaker 6>who is absolutely committed to </v>

3209
02:33:45.310 --> 02:33:45.310
<v Speaker 6>something,</v>
<v Speaker 6>whether.</v>

3210
02:33:45.310 --> 02:33:49.661
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how many times did people like seeing </v>

3211
02:33:49.661 --> 02:33:51.761
<v Speaker 6>that Bob Ross guy committing to painting</v>
<v Speaker 6>and they wanted to become a painter </v>

3212
02:33:51.761 --> 02:33:53.130
<v Speaker 6>because it's attractive when you see </v>
<v Speaker 6>someone who's into something you want to</v>

3213
02:33:53.150 --> 02:33:55.250
<v Speaker 6>Julia Child Cook or Anthony Bourdain </v>
<v Speaker 6>Cook,</v>

3214
02:33:55.520 --> 02:33:57.840
<v Speaker 6>you want to cook like God damn,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't want to cook too.</v>

3215
02:33:58.070 --> 02:33:59.280
<v Speaker 6>How's exciting?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

3216
02:33:59.330 --> 02:34:03.590
<v Speaker 6>when you see someone who's like really </v>
<v Speaker 6>into being a Muslim or really into being</v>

3217
02:34:03.680 --> 02:34:05.750
<v Speaker 6>a Buddhist or really into being a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 6>things,</v>

3218
02:34:06.140 --> 02:34:09.950
<v Speaker 6>you get sucked into it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The archetype of like the Yogi,</v>

3219
02:34:10.100 --> 02:34:13.460
<v Speaker 6>like the people that are like that fake </v>
<v Speaker 6>bullshit sot nom you know,</v>

3220
02:34:13.461 --> 02:34:14.960
<v Speaker 6>no mas De,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know those guys.</v>

3221
02:34:14.990 --> 02:34:19.990
<v Speaker 6>It was like an archetype that they sort </v>
<v Speaker 6>of follow into and they fall into it </v>

3222
02:34:19.990 --> 02:34:21.280
<v Speaker 6>because when you see it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it looks like super attractive.</v>

3223
02:34:21.280 --> 02:34:21.940
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh wow,</v>

3224
02:34:21.941 --> 02:34:24.340
<v Speaker 6>that is like really spiritual.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I want to be like him.</v>

3225
02:34:24.720 --> 02:34:26.380
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's people that are like that.</v>

3226
02:34:26.381 --> 02:34:31.381
<v Speaker 6>They're alone and they're sad and </v>
<v Speaker 6>they're vulnerable and being a Muslim </v>

3227
02:34:31.381 --> 02:34:33.790
<v Speaker 6>looks like a good idea to them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Or being a Mormon looks like a good idea</v>

3228
02:34:33.791 --> 02:34:38.791
<v Speaker 6>to them being in in some sort of a group</v>
<v Speaker 6>that accepts you and pulls you in the </v>

3229
02:34:38.791 --> 02:34:41.940
<v Speaker 6>zero.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're giving you interaction and </v>

3230
02:34:41.940 --> 02:34:41.940
<v Speaker 6>that's this.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This story is really fascinating because</v>

3231
02:34:41.940 --> 02:34:46.590
<v Speaker 6>it's something that I've always felt </v>
<v Speaker 6>compelled by because I felt minorly </v>

3232
02:34:46.590 --> 02:34:50.431
<v Speaker 6>compelled by all sorts of different </v>
<v Speaker 6>religions in my life will like I will </v>

3233
02:34:50.431 --> 02:34:54.391
<v Speaker 6>watch like even speeches are radical </v>
<v Speaker 6>Islamic speeches when these guys are </v>

3234
02:34:54.391 --> 02:34:58.711
<v Speaker 6>talking in front of these people,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in other parts of the world that speak </v>

3235
02:34:58.711 --> 02:35:00.100
<v Speaker 6>English,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but they're giant populations of them,</v>

3236
02:35:00.370 --> 02:35:04.480
<v Speaker 6>but there's something attractive even </v>
<v Speaker 6>though he's saying nobody shit about.</v>

3237
02:35:04.940 --> 02:35:09.940
<v Speaker 6>It says in the Koran,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're supposed to stone adulterers and </v>

3238
02:35:09.940 --> 02:35:10.560
<v Speaker 6>it says in the Koran,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but they're good going over like,</v>

3239
02:35:10.570 --> 02:35:15.570
<v Speaker 6>how could you?</v>
<v Speaker 6>How could you possibly know better than </v>

3240
02:35:15.570 --> 02:35:15.570
<v Speaker 6>God?</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is the.</v>

3241
02:35:15.570 --> 02:35:19.760
<v Speaker 6>Is this not the greatest answer to this </v>
<v Speaker 6>problem that God has provided and </v>

3242
02:35:19.760 --> 02:35:20.350
<v Speaker 6>everyone will clap.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He goes,</v>

3243
02:35:20.440 --> 02:35:23.410
<v Speaker 6>thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Then exactly like this is Islam,</v>

3244
02:35:23.411 --> 02:35:28.411
<v Speaker 6>and he was going on and that was like </v>
<v Speaker 6>the confidence that this guy has and </v>

3245
02:35:28.411 --> 02:35:28.930
<v Speaker 6>what he's saying becomes attractive even</v>
<v Speaker 6>to me.</v>

3246
02:35:29.110 --> 02:35:30.160
<v Speaker 6>Even to me,</v>
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>

3247
02:35:30.161 --> 02:35:34.390
<v Speaker 6>I'm nowhere near joining Islam.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm nowhere near joining Isis.</v>

3248
02:35:34.391 --> 02:35:37.350
<v Speaker 6>I'm nowhere near becoming a mormon.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm becoming a scientologist,</v>

3249
02:35:38.080 --> 02:35:39.100
<v Speaker 6>but you know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Man,</v>

3250
02:35:39.101 --> 02:35:41.650
<v Speaker 6>I'm watching this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I feel the draw.</v>

3251
02:35:41.800 --> 02:35:45.370
<v Speaker 6>Everyone feels a little bit because the </v>
<v Speaker 6>guy is,</v>

3252
02:35:45.820 --> 02:35:48.910
<v Speaker 6>he's compelling and and a lot of them </v>
<v Speaker 6>are religious people.</v>

3253
02:35:48.911 --> 02:35:53.911
<v Speaker 6>People that believe in wholeheartedly in</v>
<v Speaker 6>everything that they're saying and they </v>

3254
02:35:53.911 --> 02:35:55.120
<v Speaker 6>have charisma and they have passion </v>
<v Speaker 6>behind it.</v>

3255
02:35:55.160 --> 02:36:00.160
<v Speaker 6>Like I don't have those things.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I want to be like him because I feel </v>

3256
02:36:00.160 --> 02:36:02.020
<v Speaker 6>like he's giving off positive,</v>
<v Speaker 6>strong energy and if he's right,</v>

3257
02:36:02.350 --> 02:36:07.350
<v Speaker 6>if he's right about God and God really </v>
<v Speaker 6>is on the side of the righteous and he </v>

3258
02:36:07.350 --> 02:36:10.570
<v Speaker 6>will lead us towards God damn.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Guys seem super convinced.</v>

3259
02:36:10.571 --> 02:36:13.000
<v Speaker 6>I'm not convinced of anything like that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but you get drawn into it.</v>

3260
02:36:13.030 --> 02:36:18.030
<v Speaker 7>I think one thing that you're </v>
<v Speaker 7>overlooking is the idea that I was at </v>

3261
02:36:19.571 --> 02:36:20.920
<v Speaker 7>sheldrake.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He talks about,</v>

3262
02:36:21.130 --> 02:36:26.130
<v Speaker 7>I think he used the term ease is the </v>
<v Speaker 7>term Murrano how like certain belief </v>

3263
02:36:26.130 --> 02:36:28.630
<v Speaker 7>systems create Ronald's and the time </v>
<v Speaker 7>space continuum or like they.</v>

3264
02:36:28.740 --> 02:36:33.740
<v Speaker 7>It kind of like like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like in Conan when he's walking around </v>

3265
02:36:33.740 --> 02:36:37.471
<v Speaker 7>in the wheel,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the wheel and it he like he did like </v>

3266
02:36:37.471 --> 02:36:40.681
<v Speaker 7>from walking around so many times.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There's actually like a trench that he </v>

3267
02:36:40.681 --> 02:36:41.680
<v Speaker 7>takes out.</v>
<v Speaker 7>His groove comes to,</v>

3268
02:36:41.681 --> 02:36:46.681
<v Speaker 7>exist in the universe and those grooves </v>
<v Speaker 7>are the major world religions and so you</v>

3269
02:36:47.041 --> 02:36:52.041
<v Speaker 7>know right now,</v>
<v Speaker 7>not only are people shitting and float </v>

3270
02:36:52.041 --> 02:36:52.120
<v Speaker 7>tanks,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but right now at this very moment,</v>

3271
02:36:52.450 --> 02:36:57.450
<v Speaker 7>people and mosques in great numbers all </v>
<v Speaker 7>across the planet or intoning these very</v>

3272
02:36:58.571 --> 02:37:03.571
<v Speaker 7>sacred words that come from a mystical </v>
<v Speaker 7>book and they're singing them and that </v>

3273
02:37:04.751 --> 02:37:08.650
<v Speaker 7>creates a resonance that you can tune </v>
<v Speaker 7>into at anytime that you want to.</v>

3274
02:37:09.040 --> 02:37:11.590
<v Speaker 7>And that's the poll that I believe </v>
<v Speaker 7>you're feeling.</v>

3275
02:37:11.591 --> 02:37:15.710
<v Speaker 7>It's more than just I want to fit in or </v>
<v Speaker 7>I want to be a disciplined person.</v>

3276
02:37:16.130 --> 02:37:21.130
<v Speaker 7>It's like you start by dipping your toe </v>
<v Speaker 7>in this river of subjective universe,</v>

3277
02:37:22.281 --> 02:37:27.281
<v Speaker 7>which is whatever religion it is that </v>
<v Speaker 7>you're exploring and then you stick in </v>

3278
02:37:27.281 --> 02:37:30.221
<v Speaker 7>your foot and then you stick in your </v>
<v Speaker 7>other foot and the next thing you know </v>

3279
02:37:30.221 --> 02:37:33.791
<v Speaker 7>that motherfucker will suck you in and </v>
<v Speaker 7>we'll pull you into the into that </v>

3280
02:37:35.121 --> 02:37:40.121
<v Speaker 7>particular dance that a group of people </v>
<v Speaker 7>are doing and it's a very beautiful </v>

3281
02:37:40.641 --> 02:37:45.641
<v Speaker 7>dance to beautiful thing to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We've talked about this a million times </v>

3282
02:37:45.641 --> 02:37:49.211
<v Speaker 7>before,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but when you're watching that and </v>

3283
02:37:49.211 --> 02:37:51.850
<v Speaker 7>credible drift of pilgrims is they're </v>
<v Speaker 7>moving around that.</v>

3284
02:37:51.981 --> 02:37:54.350
<v Speaker 7>What's the name of the cop that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>What's it called?</v>

3285
02:37:54.351 --> 02:37:55.940
<v Speaker 7>The Kaaba Makkah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but it's called.</v>

3286
02:37:56.070 --> 02:38:01.070
<v Speaker 7>I don't know what it's called,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but I know we're talking about and it's </v>

3287
02:38:01.070 --> 02:38:03.071
<v Speaker 7>got a media right in it and his </v>
<v Speaker 7>beautiful surging ocean of people </v>

3288
02:38:03.071 --> 02:38:07.271
<v Speaker 7>dressed in white or like touching the </v>
<v Speaker 7>stone and it's incredible to watch and </v>

3289
02:38:07.271 --> 02:38:08.660
<v Speaker 7>it's really does help me to write in it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Right?</v>

3290
02:38:08.870 --> 02:38:10.450
<v Speaker 7>I think it's immediate.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's a black state.</v>

3291
02:38:10.451 --> 02:38:15.451
<v Speaker 7>I think it's a media.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's a blackstone hold us up and it's </v>

3292
02:38:15.451 --> 02:38:18.881
<v Speaker 7>rundown from other fingers touching them</v>
<v Speaker 7>and if you think all those people in </v>

3293
02:38:18.881 --> 02:38:22.580
<v Speaker 7>that swirl of humanity or isis level,</v>
<v Speaker 7>fundamentalist lunatic assholes,</v>

3294
02:38:22.581 --> 02:38:27.581
<v Speaker 7>you're just tricking yourself because </v>
<v Speaker 7>you want the universe to be black and </v>

3295
02:38:27.581 --> 02:38:30.611
<v Speaker 7>white and it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 7>A lot of those people are really very </v>

3296
02:38:30.611 --> 02:38:34.001
<v Speaker 7>advanced beings who have just been drawn</v>
<v Speaker 7>into the particular way that the </v>

3297
02:38:34.001 --> 02:38:34.130
<v Speaker 7>universe expresses itself.</v>

3298
02:38:34.590 --> 02:38:39.590
<v Speaker 5>This is not to be trusted because it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>one of those World News daily report.</v>

3299
02:38:40.001 --> 02:38:41.270
<v Speaker 5>Dr.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Trusted.</v>

3300
02:38:41.740 --> 02:38:43.420
<v Speaker 5>What did they say?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It is Saudi Arabia.</v>

3301
02:38:43.421 --> 02:38:48.421
<v Speaker 5>Blackstone of Mecca.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Blackstone of Mecca revealed to be a </v>

3302
02:38:48.421 --> 02:38:48.421
<v Speaker 5>media.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

3303
02:38:48.421 --> 02:38:50.650
<v Speaker 5>It's a real problem with that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Websites were printed though.</v>

3304
02:38:50.740 --> 02:38:52.420
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't know what it is.</v>

3305
02:38:52.421 --> 02:38:54.190
<v Speaker 7>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's price.</v>

3306
02:38:54.191 --> 02:38:55.870
<v Speaker 7>Something weird though.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Media,</v>

3307
02:38:55.871 --> 02:38:57.100
<v Speaker 7>right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Worship of the blocks down.</v>

3308
02:38:57.101 --> 02:38:59.180
<v Speaker 7>There's more than one website that says </v>
<v Speaker 7>that.</v>

3309
02:38:59.240 --> 02:39:03.490
<v Speaker 7>I'm got to go to wikipedia and look up.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Blacks done for some reason.</v>

3310
02:39:03.491 --> 02:39:06.670
<v Speaker 7>Wikipedia Islam's media at the circle.</v>
<v Speaker 7>At the Kaaba.</v>

3311
02:39:07.000 --> 02:39:07.810
<v Speaker 7>The Kaaba.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

3312
02:39:07.811 --> 02:39:10.990
<v Speaker 7>that's what it's called.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm googling it right in front of her.</v>

3313
02:39:12.030 --> 02:39:13.430
<v Speaker 5>Page two.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It says worship.</v>

3314
02:39:13.460 --> 02:39:18.460
<v Speaker 5>It's not what worship are Muslims,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it is a media right inside that </v>

3315
02:39:18.460 --> 02:39:20.420
<v Speaker 5>thing though the Capa stone,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it is.</v>

3316
02:39:20.421 --> 02:39:25.421
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So even if it's not worshiped by </v>

3317
02:39:25.421 --> 02:39:27.641
<v Speaker 5>Muslims,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's at the center of their worship </v>

3318
02:39:27.641 --> 02:39:27.680
<v Speaker 5>spot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that's probably significant.</v>

3319
02:39:28.270 --> 02:39:30.820
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's pretty crazy.</v>

3320
02:39:30.970 --> 02:39:32.920
<v Speaker 7>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and the other black stone,</v>

3321
02:39:33.280 --> 02:39:37.120
<v Speaker 7>do you ever play as it is that it right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There isn't the only image of blackstone</v>

3322
02:39:37.150 --> 02:39:42.150
<v Speaker 7>or hygiene.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oral as swabbed is the eastern corner </v>

3323
02:39:42.150 --> 02:39:43.750
<v Speaker 7>stone of the Kaaba that the agent still </v>
<v Speaker 7>building,</v>

3324
02:39:43.751 --> 02:39:45.910
<v Speaker 7>located in the center of the Grand </v>
<v Speaker 7>Mosque in Mecca.</v>

3325
02:39:45.970 --> 02:39:49.180
<v Speaker 7>It is revered by Muslims is an Islamic </v>
<v Speaker 7>relic,</v>

3326
02:39:49.181 --> 02:39:53.320
<v Speaker 7>which according to Muslim tradition </v>
<v Speaker 7>dates back to the time of Adam and eve.</v>

3327
02:39:53.490 --> 02:39:58.490
<v Speaker 5>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 5>go to the Google image search and you </v>

3328
02:39:58.490 --> 02:39:59.810
<v Speaker 5>can see the actual thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It looks like a vagina.</v>

3329
02:40:00.070 --> 02:40:04.730
<v Speaker 5>It's like the vagina of the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Could imagine if that was like that.</v>

3330
02:40:04.731 --> 02:40:08.770
<v Speaker 5>Literally is the vagina of the universe </v>
<v Speaker 5>more like</v>

3331
02:40:08.770 --> 02:40:10.420
<v Speaker 7>a belly button.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh yeah.</v>

3332
02:40:10.421 --> 02:40:14.290
<v Speaker 7>It does have a kind of very vaginal wow.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The region</v>

3333
02:40:14.310 --> 02:40:17.310
<v Speaker 6>there and touching the vagina of the </v>
<v Speaker 6>universe.</v>

3334
02:40:18.650 --> 02:40:20.990
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean if that was a media right.</v>

3335
02:40:21.380 --> 02:40:26.380
<v Speaker 6>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and that means it came crashing down to </v>

3336
02:40:26.380 --> 02:40:27.530
<v Speaker 6>earth from the Schuylkill,</v>
<v Speaker 6>smoothly touching it.</v>

3337
02:40:28.920 --> 02:40:30.770
<v Speaker 6>I don't know where you've been buying </v>
<v Speaker 6>your walnuts.</v>

3338
02:40:30.771 --> 02:40:33.340
<v Speaker 6>I can go to a new place.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Looks like a dragon egg.</v>

3339
02:40:33.950 --> 02:40:35.370
<v Speaker 6>It looks like a vagina.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Goddamn man.</v>

3340
02:40:35.371 --> 02:40:37.100
<v Speaker 6>It's a dragon egg.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a vagina.</v>

3341
02:40:37.520 --> 02:40:41.810
<v Speaker 6>So if you think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>birth life came out of impact.</v>

3342
02:40:41.811 --> 02:40:45.950
<v Speaker 6>If it wasn't for the impact of comments,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we wouldn't have water apparently.</v>

3343
02:40:46.010 --> 02:40:49.610
<v Speaker 6>Is that true?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I believe that water came from comments.</v>

3344
02:40:49.640 --> 02:40:52.130
<v Speaker 6>I've heard that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know if they know that for sure,</v>

3345
02:40:52.370 --> 02:40:55.340
<v Speaker 6>but we do know for sure that if it </v>
<v Speaker 6>wasn't for the meteor impact that killed</v>

3346
02:40:55.341 --> 02:40:56.840
<v Speaker 6>the dinosaurs,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we'd be fucked.</v>

3347
02:40:57.170 --> 02:40:58.980
<v Speaker 6>We would not have made it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

3348
02:40:59.300 --> 02:41:04.300
<v Speaker 6>We've got neat and everywhere you look,</v>
<v Speaker 6>giant fucking dinosaurs have a loss of </v>

3349
02:41:04.300 --> 02:41:05.030
<v Speaker 6>raptors t rexes.</v>

3350
02:41:05.210 --> 02:41:07.510
<v Speaker 6>You never figured out the airplane.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If there was terra data,</v>

3351
02:41:07.830 --> 02:41:11.680
<v Speaker 6>you are taking too much time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You fly around a jackie would eat you.</v>

3352
02:41:11.690 --> 02:41:12.320
<v Speaker 6>You'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>fuck,</v>

3353
02:41:12.321 --> 02:41:14.720
<v Speaker 6>we can't fly yet.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We gotta kill all the carryback dose and</v>

3354
02:41:14.721 --> 02:41:17.120
<v Speaker 6>that you'd never get to them because you</v>
<v Speaker 6>can't fly.</v>

3355
02:41:17.210 --> 02:41:19.610
<v Speaker 6>So how are you going to get to them?</v>
<v Speaker 6>You'd have to get to the point where you</v>

3356
02:41:19.611 --> 02:41:24.611
<v Speaker 6>invented the the jet,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like a fighter jet where there was no </v>

3357
02:41:24.611 --> 02:41:26.120
<v Speaker 6>Tara Dac dolls.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That was the only way,</v>

3358
02:41:26.121 --> 02:41:28.010
<v Speaker 6>and then you have to fly over to where </v>
<v Speaker 6>the fuck they are.</v>

3359
02:41:28.020 --> 02:41:30.390
<v Speaker 6>Make sure you have a big tank of gas and</v>
<v Speaker 6>Jack All.</v>

3360
02:41:30.400 --> 02:41:32.960
<v Speaker 6>Make sure you kill all of them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Then you can spread air travel.</v>

3361
02:41:33.190 --> 02:41:38.190
<v Speaker 6>Imagine if you had to try and sell </v>
<v Speaker 6>tickets for American Airlines and you </v>

3362
02:41:38.190 --> 02:41:39.260
<v Speaker 6>might get taken out by Tara dactyl the </v>
<v Speaker 6>fuck out of here.</v>

3363
02:41:39.440 --> 02:41:44.440
<v Speaker 6>No one's going to fly anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Most people wouldn't even fly on an </v>

3364
02:41:44.440 --> 02:41:44.600
<v Speaker 6>airline that has a last name.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Asia,</v>

3365
02:41:44.660 --> 02:41:45.590
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>At this point,</v>

3366
02:41:45.591 --> 02:41:47.870
<v Speaker 6>people are terrified about things drop </v>
<v Speaker 6>into the ocean.</v>

3367
02:41:48.260 --> 02:41:51.290
<v Speaker 6>If there was tared axles in the event of</v>
<v Speaker 6>a pterodactyl attack,</v>

3368
02:41:51.291 --> 02:41:55.640
<v Speaker 6>do not panic.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The key is to look like an egg.</v>

3369
02:41:56.630 --> 02:41:59.150
<v Speaker 6>They can't see very well.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The only they don't move.</v>

3370
02:41:59.151 --> 02:42:03.470
<v Speaker 6>They use egg edge detection in the very </v>
<v Speaker 6>unlikely event of a pterodactyl attack.</v>

3371
02:42:03.740 --> 02:42:04.340
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

3372
02:42:04.341 --> 02:42:09.341
<v Speaker 6>I feel.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I feel like that when I go swimming in </v>

3373
02:42:09.341 --> 02:42:09.341
<v Speaker 6>the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>

3374
02:42:09.341 --> 02:42:09.341
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>sharks are the terra data.</v>

3375
02:42:09.341 --> 02:42:14.090
<v Speaker 6>How's that see there?</v>
<v Speaker 6>These ancient to mouth that are just </v>

3376
02:42:14.090 --> 02:42:15.320
<v Speaker 6>monsters grow.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 6>like jaws is happening in North </v>

3378
02:42:20.321 --> 02:42:20.321
<v Speaker 6>Carolina.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

3379
02:42:20.321 --> 02:42:22.940
<v Speaker 6>how about two people got their arms cut </v>
<v Speaker 6>off inside of the day.</v>

3380
02:42:23.180 --> 02:42:25.690
<v Speaker 6>She's two people an hour apart from each</v>
<v Speaker 6>other.</v>

<v Speaker 6>did he know about the first two because </v>

<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

3467
02:45:58.110 --> 02:46:00.910
<v Speaker 5>It's a great question because it doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 5>seem like it's going to help like sweaty</v>

3468
02:46:00.911 --> 02:46:02.050
<v Speaker 5>palms.</v>

02:46:02.051 --> 02:46:04.900
<v Speaker 5>If you want to grab onto something,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's going to be harder to do it.</v>

3470
02:46:04.901 --> 02:46:06.280
<v Speaker 5>It seems weird.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't worst.</v>

3471
02:46:07.010 --> 02:46:08.980
<v Speaker 5>It's not good for anything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3472
02:46:09.000 --> 02:46:10.060
<v Speaker 5>Your.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Your grip gets</v>

3473
02:46:10.070 --> 02:46:15.070
<v Speaker 6>slippery for a pool.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like it was always a plague of </v>

3474
02:46:15.070 --> 02:46:16.360
<v Speaker 6>mine.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I used to actually spray anti perspirant</v>

3475
02:46:16.370 --> 02:46:17.980
<v Speaker 6>I'm a hands.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh Wow.</v>

3476
02:46:18.020 --> 02:46:19.490
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and then I found this stuff called.</v>

3477
02:46:19.610 --> 02:46:24.610
<v Speaker 6>It's called like hands dry or dry hands </v>
<v Speaker 6>or something like that.</v>

3478
02:46:25.010 --> 02:46:30.010
<v Speaker 6>It's essentially like antiperspirant for</v>
<v Speaker 6>people that have a problem with the </v>

3479
02:46:30.010 --> 02:46:30.010
<v Speaker 6>doing something,</v>
<v Speaker 6>need to have dry hands.</v>

3480
02:46:30.080 --> 02:46:32.120
<v Speaker 6>Now it's squirted on my hands and rub </v>
<v Speaker 6>it,</v>

3481
02:46:32.240 --> 02:46:35.240
<v Speaker 6>rub it all over my hands and then it </v>
<v Speaker 6>would allow me to play pool better where</v>

3482
02:46:35.260 --> 02:46:40.260
<v Speaker 6>I could concentrate on just playing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I didn't have to worry about my hands </v>

3483
02:46:40.260 --> 02:46:41.510
<v Speaker 6>wiping them down every five minutes like</v>
<v Speaker 6>I used to drink.</v>

3484
02:46:41.600 --> 02:46:45.200
<v Speaker 6>I used to bring a wet towel with me that</v>
<v Speaker 6>would wipe my hands with a wet towel and</v>

3485
02:46:45.201 --> 02:46:47.750
<v Speaker 6>then I would drive them off with a dry </v>
<v Speaker 6>towel and I had to do that over and over</v>

3486
02:46:47.751 --> 02:46:48.230
<v Speaker 6>and over again.</v>

3487
02:46:48.590 --> 02:46:51.860
<v Speaker 6>My hands are sweating for no reason,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no reason.</v>

3488
02:46:51.900 --> 02:46:56.900
<v Speaker 6>It was a stupid game,</v>
<v Speaker 6>knocking the ball into another ball and </v>

3489
02:46:56.900 --> 02:46:57.890
<v Speaker 6>I'm like life and death.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Life and death.</v>

3490
02:46:57.891 --> 02:47:00.170
<v Speaker 6>My body temperature is changing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm sweating,</v>

3491
02:47:00.590 --> 02:47:03.110
<v Speaker 6>sweating over a fucking game.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Wasn't even for a lot of money,</v>

3496
02:47:09.771 --> 02:47:12.140
<v Speaker 6>What a strange thing that your body just</v>
<v Speaker 6>squirts out.</v>

3497
02:47:12.141 --> 02:47:15.440
<v Speaker 6>Saltwater whenever it gets too hot,</v>
<v Speaker 6>freaks out.</v>

02:47:15.860 --> 02:47:20.860
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 6>so don't complain.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And that's cryotherapy.</v>

<v Speaker 6>Where do you do it?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I do it down here in woodland hills.</v>

3507
02:47:37.341 --> 02:47:40.610
<v Speaker 6>They have a place on Ventura Boulevard,</v>
<v Speaker 6>cryo healthcare.</v>

3508
02:47:40.611 --> 02:47:44.510
<v Speaker 6>There's another place in la,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but there's a lot of people that do it.</v>

3509
02:47:44.540 --> 02:47:45.410
<v Speaker 6>They just,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

3510
02:47:45.670 --> 02:47:47.990
<v Speaker 6>it's not as effective,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it's pretty fucking effective.</v>

3511
02:47:48.320 --> 02:47:51.680
<v Speaker 6>Just an ice bath.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Just fill up a tank filled with water or</v>

3512
02:47:51.681 --> 02:47:56.681
<v Speaker 6>a tub rather filled with water and a lot</v>
<v Speaker 6>of fucking ice and just climb on it and </v>

3513
02:47:56.681 --> 02:48:00.381
<v Speaker 6>it's a box,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but there's something that happens when </v>

3514
02:48:00.381 --> 02:48:04.601
<v Speaker 6>you ice yourself down like that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The decrease of inflammation makes you </v>

3515
02:48:04.601 --> 02:48:06.530
<v Speaker 6>feel fucking fantastic and it allows </v>
<v Speaker 6>your body to heal more effectively.</v>

3516
02:48:07.040 --> 02:48:12.040
<v Speaker 6>Like dude,</v>
<v Speaker 6>extreme cold is incredible for </v>

3517
02:48:12.040 --> 02:48:15.581
<v Speaker 6>inflammation,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so I've done it every day except the </v>

3518
02:48:15.581 --> 02:48:18.761
<v Speaker 6>weekends.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I didn't do it the weekend he did </v>

3519
02:48:18.761 --> 02:48:18.761
<v Speaker 6>apparently to do today,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right before the show.</v>

3520
02:48:18.761 --> 02:48:18.790
<v Speaker 6>I do it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I do it,</v>

3521
02:48:18.800 --> 02:48:23.800
<v Speaker 6>try to do it five days a week these days</v>
<v Speaker 6>and I'm doing it five days a week and I </v>

3522
02:48:23.800 --> 02:48:25.370
<v Speaker 6>fucking feel fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Fantastic.</v>

3523
02:48:25.400 --> 02:48:28.190
<v Speaker 6>I've heard that all my like little aches</v>
<v Speaker 6>and pains,</v>

3524
02:48:28.191 --> 02:48:30.530
<v Speaker 6>they're all like diminishing </v>
<v Speaker 6>significantly.</v>

3525
02:48:30.890 --> 02:48:33.560
<v Speaker 6>Everything seems to be like loosening up</v>
<v Speaker 6>and relaxing,</v>

3526
02:48:34.230 --> 02:48:36.410
<v Speaker 6>like what's the mechanics of that?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like what?</v>

3527
02:48:36.411 --> 02:48:41.411
<v Speaker 6>Explain it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But the other thing I'm doing is hot </v>

3528
02:48:41.411 --> 02:48:43.451
<v Speaker 6>yoga and the hot yoga in combination </v>
<v Speaker 6>with that is very interesting because </v>

3529
02:48:43.451 --> 02:48:47.621
<v Speaker 6>I've been doing the hot yoga at least </v>
<v Speaker 6>two days a week and then I'll do like </v>

3530
02:48:47.621 --> 02:48:50.831
<v Speaker 6>some other stretches,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like a third day a week with my other </v>

3531
02:48:50.831 --> 02:48:53.261
<v Speaker 6>workouts that I do.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But I'm forcing myself to do two days a </v>

3532
02:48:53.261 --> 02:48:53.780
<v Speaker 6>week of hot yoga.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's fucking hard,</v>

3533
02:48:53.781 --> 02:48:57.260
<v Speaker 6>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's hard to do like surprisingly hard.</v>

3534
02:48:57.470 --> 02:48:59.510
<v Speaker 6>And the.</v>
<v Speaker 6>When the class is almost over,</v>

3535
02:48:59.780 --> 02:49:01.280
<v Speaker 6>I'm fucking exhausted.</v>

3536
02:49:01.280 --> 02:49:04.640
<v Speaker 6>I mean like really exhausted and so hot </v>
<v Speaker 6>that I want to quit.</v>

3537
02:49:04.850 --> 02:49:09.850
<v Speaker 6>I want to quit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like the last 10 minutes is don't be a </v>

3538
02:49:09.850 --> 02:49:09.850
<v Speaker 6>bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's the last 10 minutes.</v>

3539
02:49:09.900 --> 02:49:13.170
<v Speaker 6>All the exercises are fairly easy and </v>
<v Speaker 6>it's just don't leave yet.</v>

3540
02:49:13.350 --> 02:49:14.910
<v Speaker 6>Don't leave yet.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Hang in there.</v>

3541
02:49:14.970 --> 02:49:16.500
<v Speaker 6>Don't leave yet.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Hang in there.</v>

3542
02:49:16.860 --> 02:49:18.790
<v Speaker 6>And your body's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>dude is too fucking hot near.</v>

3543
02:49:18.870 --> 02:49:21.510
<v Speaker 6>You've got to just deal with it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Just deal with it and get through.</v>

3544
02:49:21.840 --> 02:49:26.840
<v Speaker 6>And there's this.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know if you've ever seen the </v>

3545
02:49:26.840 --> 02:49:26.840
<v Speaker 6>podcasts I've done with Dr Rhonda </v>
<v Speaker 6>Patrick.</v>

3546
02:49:26.840 --> 02:49:28.080
<v Speaker 6>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I can't wait to talk to her about this,</v>

3547
02:49:28.081 --> 02:49:30.540
<v Speaker 6>but she's just brilliant,</v>
<v Speaker 6>brilliant lady,</v>

3548
02:49:30.541 --> 02:49:35.541
<v Speaker 6>and she wrote a paper about sauna and </v>
<v Speaker 6>one of the things about Saunas is that </v>

3549
02:49:35.541 --> 02:49:40.071
<v Speaker 6>they've experienced this radical </v>
<v Speaker 6>decrease in mortality rates amongst </v>

3550
02:49:40.381 --> 02:49:45.381
<v Speaker 6>people who take sauna and she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's a 40 percent decrease across the </v>

3551
02:49:45.381 --> 02:49:45.381
<v Speaker 6>board.</v>

3552
02:49:45.381 --> 02:49:47.010
<v Speaker 6>Everything with like cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 6>heart attacks,</v>

3553
02:49:47.011 --> 02:49:49.290
<v Speaker 6>all these different things.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's an effect that's happening.</v>

3554
02:49:49.291 --> 02:49:51.540
<v Speaker 6>You mean like a steam hyper heat?</v>
<v Speaker 6>The Body Saunas?</v>

3555
02:49:51.550 --> 02:49:52.770
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You go into a sauna,</v>

3556
02:49:52.771 --> 02:49:57.771
<v Speaker 6>hot sauna.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's something that happens when you </v>

3557
02:49:57.771 --> 02:50:00.231
<v Speaker 6>extreme,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when you extremely heat up the body </v>

3558
02:50:00.231 --> 02:50:02.960
<v Speaker 6>where the body has to respond to the </v>
<v Speaker 6>heat and then it develops this reaction </v>

3559
02:50:02.960 --> 02:50:05.850
<v Speaker 6>to these extreme temperatures for short </v>
<v Speaker 6>durations.</v>

3560
02:50:06.000 --> 02:50:08.520
<v Speaker 6>Now I don't know how much time you're </v>
<v Speaker 6>supposed to sit in a sauna,</v>

3561
02:50:08.850 --> 02:50:12.150
<v Speaker 6>but the time that you sit in a sauna,</v>
<v Speaker 6>whatever happens to your body,</v>

3562
02:50:12.151 --> 02:50:17.151
<v Speaker 6>once you get out and your body cools </v>
<v Speaker 6>itself down and there is a compensatory </v>

3563
02:50:17.151 --> 02:50:21.441
<v Speaker 6>mechanism that helps your body in some </v>
<v Speaker 6>crazy way that they're still trying to </v>

3564
02:50:21.441 --> 02:50:25.281
<v Speaker 6>understand now,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and the same can be said for Cryo </v>

3565
02:50:25.281 --> 02:50:26.220
<v Speaker 6>therapy and cryotherapy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think it's called sidechains,</v>

3566
02:50:26.370 --> 02:50:31.370
<v Speaker 6>like when you get below 150 degrees,</v>
<v Speaker 6>your body produces these anti </v>

3567
02:50:31.370 --> 02:50:31.370
<v Speaker 6>inflammatory responses.</v>

3568
02:50:31.370 --> 02:50:35.780
<v Speaker 6>There's Pub Med studies on it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's a bunch of different studies </v>

3569
02:50:35.780 --> 02:50:35.780
<v Speaker 6>explained to her.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't understand.</v>

3570
02:50:35.780 --> 02:50:36.390
<v Speaker 6>You don't because you're only in there </v>
<v Speaker 6>for three minutes.</v>

3571
02:50:36.790 --> 02:50:41.790
<v Speaker 6>Seems like a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Seems like a long time while you're in </v>

3572
02:50:41.790 --> 02:50:43.971
<v Speaker 6>there too,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it's enough that you can get out of </v>

3573
02:50:43.971 --> 02:50:46.101
<v Speaker 6>it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like when it gets more than three </v>

3574
02:50:46.101 --> 02:50:47.481
<v Speaker 6>minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it gets real tricky and you don't have </v>

3575
02:50:47.481 --> 02:50:47.481
<v Speaker 6>to.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You don't touch anything like your hands</v>

3576
02:50:47.481 --> 02:50:48.420
<v Speaker 6>are in gloves,</v>
<v Speaker 6>surgical mask on your face.</v>

3577
02:50:48.540 --> 02:50:51.510
<v Speaker 6>You have earmuffs and the extremities </v>
<v Speaker 6>are covered.</v>

3578
02:50:51.511 --> 02:50:54.480
<v Speaker 6>Your extremities are covered with gloves</v>
<v Speaker 6>and your toes are covered with socks.</v>

3579
02:50:54.481 --> 02:50:57.780
<v Speaker 6>And then you wear crocs.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So you're standing in rubber crocs,</v>

3580
02:50:57.930 --> 02:50:59.760
<v Speaker 6>so your feet don't touch the out of your</v>
<v Speaker 6>cock.</v>

3581
02:50:59.820 --> 02:51:01.980
<v Speaker 6>Your cock is in your underwear.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Believe it or not,</v>

3582
02:51:01.981 --> 02:51:04.150
<v Speaker 6>the congress doesn't get that cold.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

3583
02:51:04.180 --> 02:51:05.700
<v Speaker 6>I deal with it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I deal with my cock,</v>

3584
02:51:05.760 --> 02:51:07.370
<v Speaker 6>my legs get cold,</v>
<v Speaker 6>my,</v>

3585
02:51:07.460 --> 02:51:08.130
<v Speaker 6>my,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

3586
02:51:08.160 --> 02:51:09.840
<v Speaker 6>my nipples get fucking cold.</v>

3587
02:51:09.930 --> 02:51:12.330
<v Speaker 6>Sometimes I wind up doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I want to cover my nipples,</v>

3588
02:51:12.900 --> 02:51:17.900
<v Speaker 6>but for the most part what's happening </v>
<v Speaker 6>is your body is freaking the fuck out </v>

3589
02:51:17.900 --> 02:51:21.380
<v Speaker 6>because it's freezing cold and then </v>
<v Speaker 6>because the fact that it's not freezing </v>

3590
02:51:21.380 --> 02:51:24.981
<v Speaker 6>cold anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it releases this burst of these </v>

3591
02:51:24.981 --> 02:51:27.741
<v Speaker 6>sidechains and this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this feeling of just warmth and power </v>

3592
02:51:27.741 --> 02:51:31.620
<v Speaker 6>through your body where everything just </v>
<v Speaker 6>feels like things are knocked loose.</v>

3593
02:51:31.800 --> 02:51:36.330
<v Speaker 6>It's almost like a river runs through a </v>
<v Speaker 6>clogged up stream and knocks out all the</v>

3594
02:51:36.331 --> 02:51:39.060
<v Speaker 6>trees and I want to do it man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh please.</v>

3595
02:51:39.061 --> 02:51:40.700
<v Speaker 6>I don't want to take it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'll take you tomorrow.</v>

3596
02:51:40.740 --> 02:51:42.450
<v Speaker 6>Want to go tomorrow?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I can't do it tomorrow.</v>

3597
02:51:43.380 --> 02:51:45.780
<v Speaker 6>When can you do it?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I got to look at my youtube.</v>

3598
02:51:45.830 --> 02:51:47.320
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we'll talk about it often off screen,</v>

3599
02:51:47.321 --> 02:51:49.260
<v Speaker 6>but you're going to do the comedy store </v>
<v Speaker 6>on Friday.</v>

3600
02:51:49.680 --> 02:51:51.870
<v Speaker 6>Let's do it before the comments died.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Done.</v>

3601
02:51:52.110 --> 02:51:52.890
<v Speaker 6>That's great.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

3602
02:51:54.470 --> 02:51:57.630
<v Speaker 6>there's one on La Sienna gotta.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Do a workout before that too.</v>

3603
02:51:57.631 --> 02:52:02.631
<v Speaker 6>Is that I will have like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well sometimes I'll actually like to do </v>

3604
02:52:02.631 --> 02:52:06.501
<v Speaker 6>it after a freeze.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They like to freeze first and then work </v>

3605
02:52:06.501 --> 02:52:06.501
<v Speaker 6>out later,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but apparently</v>

3606
02:52:06.501 --> 02:52:11.070
<v Speaker 4>you can't do that with the ice bath.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they were describing this the other </v>

3607
02:52:11.070 --> 02:52:11.070
<v Speaker 4>day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't listen to me,</v>

3608
02:52:11.070 --> 02:52:11.500
<v Speaker 4>but this was something that they were </v>
<v Speaker 4>talking about.</v>

3609
02:52:11.770 --> 02:52:12.550
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ryan,</v>

3610
02:52:12.551 --> 02:52:17.551
<v Speaker 4>the guy who runs the woodland hills </v>
<v Speaker 4>location was telling me that if you was </v>

3611
02:52:17.551 --> 02:52:22.050
<v Speaker 4>telling somebody else I was </v>
<v Speaker 4>eavesdropping that if you do an ice </v>

3612
02:52:22.050 --> 02:52:22.050
<v Speaker 4>bath,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're done for the day.</v>

3613
02:52:22.050 --> 02:52:26.041
<v Speaker 4>You don't work out today because you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>sitting in that thing for like 20 </v>

3614
02:52:26.041 --> 02:52:26.041
<v Speaker 4>minutes and it's freezing cold and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>

3615
02:52:26.041 --> 02:52:30.380
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're apparently you could fuck </v>

3616
02:52:30.380 --> 02:52:30.380
<v Speaker 4>yourself up if you work out hard after </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

3617
02:52:30.380 --> 02:52:31.570
<v Speaker 4>Funny Man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry,</v>

3618
