<v Speaker 1>I love Cleveland.</v>

11
00:00:31.551 --> 00:00:32.384
<v Speaker 1>It's a good place to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going there for a long time and I </v>

12
00:00:34.501 --> 00:00:36.270
<v Speaker 1>love the people in Cleveland.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would you do it?</v>

13
00:00:36.271 --> 00:00:37.800
<v Speaker 1>What place?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hannah theater?</v>

15
00:00:41.791 --> 00:00:44.440
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really Nice Theater and uh,</v>

16
00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:45.283
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been going to Cleveland for a long </v>

17
00:00:45.901 --> 00:00:47.850
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I liked the people there.</v>

18
00:00:47.851 --> 00:00:50.880
<v Speaker 1>It's got a good mix of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

19
00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.760
<v Speaker 1>hopefulness but grounded in reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But to make it a comeback,</v>

20
00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.020
<v Speaker 1>it is that cities really making a </v>
<v Speaker 1>comeback.</v>

21
00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.070
<v Speaker 1>Craft Stores and craft breweries and </v>
<v Speaker 1>nice restaurants.</v>

22
00:01:02.071 --> 00:01:02.904
<v Speaker 1>And I know when I started going there </v>
<v Speaker 1>you couldn't eat healthy if you tried </v>

23
00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.320
<v Speaker 1>like it was just corn beef and now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

24
00:01:10.321 --> 00:01:12.900
<v Speaker 1>15 years later there's Vegan </v>
<v Speaker 1>restaurants,</v>

25
00:01:12.901 --> 00:01:14.620
<v Speaker 1>there's all these like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

26
00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.230
<v Speaker 1>these noodle places.</v>

27
00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:17.970
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's completely come up,</v>

28
00:01:17.971 --> 00:01:20.400
<v Speaker 1>but you know when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when Lebron left,</v>

29
00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.400
<v Speaker 1>they were devastated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How crazy is that?</v>

30
00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.490
<v Speaker 1>The one guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole city just throws a ball into a</v>

31
00:01:26.491 --> 00:01:29.820
<v Speaker 1>hole completely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They took his banner off the side of the</v>

32
00:01:29.821 --> 00:01:34.821
<v Speaker 1>building and it was over and since he </v>
<v Speaker 1>came back and then one it.</v>

33
00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.980
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's changed the whole place.</v>

34
00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:40.180
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember how much they hated him</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he left.</v>

35
00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:41.970
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is ridiculous.</v>

36
00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.280
<v Speaker 1>Why are you so mad?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The guy had to get some money,</v>

37
00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.470
<v Speaker 1>but it was real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was real.</v>

38
00:01:46.471 --> 00:01:49.380
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a difference when you go </v>
<v Speaker 1>there now people are like a pride.</v>

39
00:01:49.381 --> 00:01:50.214
<v Speaker 1>They're walking around like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well they have the heavyweight champion </v>

40
00:01:51.751 --> 00:01:52.750
<v Speaker 1>of the UFC to.</v>

<v Speaker 1>He's from Cleveland to.</v>

42
00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:56.043
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the baseball team went to the world </v>

43
00:01:57.751 --> 00:01:59.580
<v Speaker 1>series,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they were like really?</v>

44
00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.370
<v Speaker 1>Like pretty fuckers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they have the brands,</v>

45
00:02:02.371 --> 00:02:04.890
<v Speaker 1>which always is that bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're bad,</v>

46
00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:05.783
<v Speaker 1>but they had Jim Brown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had Jim Brown that still haven't </v>

47
00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.270
<v Speaker 1>won one game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They haven't won one game this year.</v>

48
00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:14.850
<v Speaker 1>How many games?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They played a.</v>

49
00:02:14.851 --> 00:02:15.684
<v Speaker 1>we're up to nine or 10,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give him some time to work it out </v>

50
00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:23.990
<v Speaker 1>though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I really love that,</v>

51
00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.900
<v Speaker 1>that city and I really liked it for </v>
<v Speaker 1>standup and I figured it was a good mile</v>

52
00:02:27.901 --> 00:02:28.501
<v Speaker 1>marker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

53
00:02:28.501 --> 00:02:29.910
<v Speaker 1>you do these specials and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

54
00:02:29.911 --> 00:02:31.920
<v Speaker 1>this was this period,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

55
00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.770
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I figured this is a good place.</v>

56
00:02:34.771 --> 00:02:35.604
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to commemorate my time in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Cleveland and this material at this </v>

57
00:02:38.701 --> 00:02:40.410
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was good.</v>

58
00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.070
<v Speaker 1>How often do you like to do specials?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

59
00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.250
<v Speaker 1>this is my fourth and they come every </v>
<v Speaker 1>like two and a half years.</v>

60
00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:51.453
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty much the standard number </v>

61
00:02:53.371 --> 00:02:54.204
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone seems to like a lot of guys </v>

62
00:02:55.381 --> 00:02:56.214
<v Speaker 1>were trying to do them every year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like lily was doing one every year for </v>

63
00:02:57.991 --> 00:02:59.290
<v Speaker 1>awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then he like,</v>

64
00:02:59.291 --> 00:03:00.040
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not</v>

65
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.230
<v Speaker 3>as good when I do it once.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A year later I call,</v>

66
00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:06.610
<v Speaker 3>I called them a premise pilots.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot.</v>

67
00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.280
<v Speaker 3>There was one of the last five years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of premise pilots,</v>

68
00:03:09.281 --> 00:03:11.800
<v Speaker 3>like people just rushing them out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

69
00:03:11.801 --> 00:03:12.880
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a good idea.</v>

70
00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:15.220
<v Speaker 3>Imagine in three years with that joke </v>
<v Speaker 3>would be,</v>

71
00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:16.443
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's the thing I think even two </v>

72
00:03:18.131 --> 00:03:20.590
<v Speaker 3>and a half years and I try and just do </v>
<v Speaker 3>it when it's ready,</v>

73
00:03:20.591 --> 00:03:25.180
<v Speaker 3>but I feel like you see two and a half </v>
<v Speaker 3>years is kind of rushing it.</v>

74
00:03:25.181 --> 00:03:29.380
<v Speaker 3>There's jokes if they stay in your act </v>
<v Speaker 3>for five years,</v>

75
00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:32.740
<v Speaker 3>it's no joke that that thing becomes </v>
<v Speaker 3>something different.</v>

76
00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:34.570
<v Speaker 3>They become better,</v>
<v Speaker 3>become better.</v>

77
00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:38.610
<v Speaker 3>You find out where the beats are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you find out where the pauses should be.</v>

78
00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.500
<v Speaker 3>Find out where maybe there was some </v>
<v Speaker 3>tags.</v>

79
00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:42.613
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You developed along the way that lead </v>

80
00:03:43.271 --> 00:03:44.740
<v Speaker 3>you in a totally different direction.</v>

81
00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:45.753
<v Speaker 3>You're thinking about it differently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a confidence that you have in </v>

82
00:03:47.561 --> 00:03:48.394
<v Speaker 3>delivering it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's different than you just pushing </v>

83
00:03:49.811 --> 00:03:51.670
<v Speaker 3>it out there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you can't.</v>

84
00:03:51.671 --> 00:03:53.650
<v Speaker 3>The way that people digest everything </v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

85
00:03:53.651 --> 00:03:55.180
<v Speaker 3>You can't wait five years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

86
00:03:55.181 --> 00:03:56.014
<v Speaker 3>isn't that the issue is that you have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>bunch of Tom Papa fans and they would </v>

87
00:03:58.271 --> 00:04:00.610
<v Speaker 3>like to come see you again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they want to see new shit.</v>

88
00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:02.710
<v Speaker 3>It's not like the rolling stones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

89
00:04:02.711 --> 00:04:03.544
<v Speaker 3>If you go to see the rolling stones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want to hear sympathy for the devil </v>

90
00:04:05.801 --> 00:04:07.720
<v Speaker 3>even though they wrote it in 1967,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

91
00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:08.830
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

92
00:04:08.831 --> 00:04:09.664
<v Speaker 3>I go back and forth on that because I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>sure you've had it where you are in </v>

93
00:04:12.911 --> 00:04:13.744
<v Speaker 3>shows and you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're at the end of your set or </v>

94
00:04:15.221 --> 00:04:16.054
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People start yelling out old bits that </v>

95
00:04:17.231 --> 00:04:18.460
<v Speaker 3>they want to see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

96
00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:19.503
<v Speaker 3>And there's something I know that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>want to be new and you always want to </v>

97
00:04:23.831 --> 00:04:25.430
<v Speaker 3>push and you always want to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

98
00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:26.110
<v Speaker 3>create.</v>

99
00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:30.550
<v Speaker 3>That's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think it sells these bits short to</v>

100
00:04:30.551 --> 00:04:31.384
<v Speaker 3>think that nobody wants to see these </v>
<v Speaker 3>again because I could watch you do that </v>

101
00:04:35.741 --> 00:04:38.530
<v Speaker 3>White House bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know it.</v>

102
00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:41.350
<v Speaker 3>I watched you working on it at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>store.</v>

103
00:04:41.351 --> 00:04:44.620
<v Speaker 3>I watched you developing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've seen it a bunch,</v>

104
00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:49.730
<v Speaker 3>a bunch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guarantee I could watch that bit every</v>

105
00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:54.400
<v Speaker 3>week and like it and think it's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I worked with Seinfeld for years,</v>

106
00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:55.653
<v Speaker 3>I would watch that guy for about seven </v>
<v Speaker 3>straight years and I'd watch and hang </v>

107
00:04:59.561 --> 00:05:00.880
<v Speaker 3>out and watch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not the whole set,</v>

108
00:05:00.881 --> 00:05:04.000
<v Speaker 3>but I see when I came up to a favorite </v>
<v Speaker 3>bit of mine,</v>

109
00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:06.070
<v Speaker 3>I was laughing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was laughing,</v>

110
00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:07.593
<v Speaker 3>so I think you can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we in our own heads think that </v>

111
00:05:09.761 --> 00:05:12.700
<v Speaker 3>people don't want to see this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they do want to see it.</v>

112
00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:14.440
<v Speaker 3>Some do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the ones who don't,</v>

113
00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:15.251
<v Speaker 3>when they say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

114
00:05:15.251 --> 00:05:18.490
<v Speaker 3>you're doing the same old jokes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's so devastating.</v>

115
00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:21.070
<v Speaker 3>You gotta keep moving.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know you're right.</v>

116
00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:23.380
<v Speaker 3>That does kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The people does kill.</v>

117
00:05:23.381 --> 00:05:24.400
<v Speaker 3>You.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't like it.</v>

118
00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:29.460
<v Speaker 3>That feeling way outweighs where people </v>
<v Speaker 3>that don't mind the old jokes again,</v>

119
00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:33.850
<v Speaker 3>when I see people off after a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>after a set and like,</v>

120
00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:36.940
<v Speaker 3>you know in the lobby or whatever and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're like,</v>

121
00:05:36.941 --> 00:05:41.170
<v Speaker 3>we see you every time you come through.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We saw you two times last year.</v>

122
00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:42.723
<v Speaker 3>I completely go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The first question is did you see some </v>

123
00:05:44.981 --> 00:05:48.640
<v Speaker 3>new stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And nine times out of 10 they look at me</v>

124
00:05:48.641 --> 00:05:49.960
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well yeah,</v>

125
00:05:49.961 --> 00:05:52.400
<v Speaker 3>but it's all great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they don't really care.</v>

126
00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:55.300
<v Speaker 3>Like those fans really don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't concentrate on those people.</v>

127
00:05:55.301 --> 00:05:58.070
<v Speaker 3>Those people are too easily satisfied.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I concentrate on</v>

128
00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:02.380
<v Speaker 1>the malcontents people that just can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>wait to get on twitter immediately after</v>

129
00:06:02.381 --> 00:06:03.214
<v Speaker 1>the show was over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was still doing that White House </v>

130
00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:08.150
<v Speaker 1>fucking premise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So tired to break in.</v>

131
00:06:08.151 --> 00:06:10.360
<v Speaker 1>Happened in 2015 bro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

132
00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:11.373
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's such a unique wormy type of a </v>

133
00:06:14.511 --> 00:06:15.321
<v Speaker 1>fan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

134
00:06:15.321 --> 00:06:18.830
<v Speaker 1>But those warming type of fans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although they're not the happiest,</v>

135
00:06:18.831 --> 00:06:22.130
<v Speaker 1>nicest people in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they do keep you motivated in check.</v>

136
00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:23.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The worst for sure.</v>

137
00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:24.353
<v Speaker 1>What happened to a lot of comedians in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the eighties is that they never wrote </v>

138
00:06:26.601 --> 00:06:27.650
<v Speaker 1>new material.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

139
00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:28.573
<v Speaker 1>They just kept doing the same stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They get 45 minutes and just wrote it </v>

140
00:06:31.101 --> 00:06:31.934
<v Speaker 1>out whole career.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had a set and that like Jay Leno </v>

141
00:06:34.951 --> 00:06:36.500
<v Speaker 1>still does that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

142
00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:41.030
<v Speaker 1>He is a brilliant comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you go back to the early days of</v>

143
00:06:41.031 --> 00:06:41.640
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

144
00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:44.260
<v Speaker 1>the tonight show and the letterman show </v>
<v Speaker 1>and yeah.</v>

145
00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:46.940
<v Speaker 1>Leno was the edgy young guy.</v>

146
00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:48.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would come on.</v>

147
00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:51.680
<v Speaker 1>And he was this great joke writer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very relevant,</v>

148
00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:52.670
<v Speaker 1>sit down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boom.</v>

149
00:06:52.671 --> 00:06:53.504
<v Speaker 1>But he put out a showtime special that </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm aware of that I watched a long time </v>

150
00:06:56.781 --> 00:06:57.614
<v Speaker 1>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He might have found that and bought up </v>

151
00:06:58.681 --> 00:07:00.680
<v Speaker 1>every copy of it and burned it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

152
00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:03.200
<v Speaker 1>never seen it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't put out anything now.</v>

153
00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:04.850
<v Speaker 1>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When he goes on stage,</v>

154
00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:05.713
<v Speaker 1>he wants the audience to have no idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>what his jokes are because they could </v>

155
00:07:07.881 --> 00:07:10.010
<v Speaker 1>never see them on the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can't find him anywhere.</v>

156
00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:11.300
<v Speaker 1>He said that to me once.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

157
00:07:11.301 --> 00:07:13.100
<v Speaker 1>why would you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would you record?</v>

158
00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:17.450
<v Speaker 1>Why would you put out an album?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're killing your act because you your</v>

159
00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:21.200
<v Speaker 1>act fee to your actors with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would you just give that away?</v>

160
00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:22.900
<v Speaker 1>But it's a different thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>

161
00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.220
<v Speaker 1>It's changed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the media,</v>

162
00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:30.200
<v Speaker 1>how people can digest this stuff has </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually changed what a comedian is,</v>

163
00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:34.280
<v Speaker 1>but with all due respect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when people today think about Jay Leno,</v>

164
00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:37.430
<v Speaker 1>they don't think of the great standup </v>
<v Speaker 1>comedians today.</v>

165
00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:41.170
<v Speaker 1>They don't think of Jay Leno even when </v>
<v Speaker 1>even before the prior.</v>

166
00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:44.480
<v Speaker 1>The rather cosby controversially went </v>
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

167
00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:47.510
<v Speaker 1>Cosby was still considered all time </v>
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>

168
00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:48.960
<v Speaker 1>One of the all time greats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

169
00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:52.520
<v Speaker 1>And Leno was in that ilk at one point in</v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

170
00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:54.740
<v Speaker 1>He's never.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's not considered that.</v>

171
00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:55.900
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

172
00:07:55.950 --> 00:07:59.270
<v Speaker 1>And you think that's because the tonight</v>
<v Speaker 1>show,</v>

173
00:07:59.271 --> 00:08:01.280
<v Speaker 1>do you think if he could have done the </v>
<v Speaker 1>tonight show and put out?</v>

174
00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:02.353
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for sure material he would have for </v>

175
00:08:03.291 --> 00:08:06.020
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he has his no body of work.</v>

176
00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:07.280
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a big.</v>

177
00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:08.400
<v Speaker 1>That's a big problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

178
00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:09.253
<v Speaker 1>it's everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of guys that are really </v>

179
00:08:11.061 --> 00:08:11.894
<v Speaker 1>good that we all know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like Duncan trussell is a perfect </v>

180
00:08:12.891 --> 00:08:14.660
<v Speaker 1>example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Duncan trussell is a brilliant comedian.</v>

181
00:08:14.730 --> 00:08:16.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His no body of work.</v>

182
00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:18.140
<v Speaker 1>Like he doesn't have anything out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

183
00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:19.820
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

184
00:08:19.821 --> 00:08:20.654
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where my head is at lately is whatever </v>

185
00:08:24.741 --> 00:08:25.940
<v Speaker 1>you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever you're hustling,</v>

186
00:08:25.941 --> 00:08:29.660
<v Speaker 1>whatever you're trying to put out there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all about making stuff.</v>

187
00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:31.940
<v Speaker 1>It's all about making stuff that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>proud of.</v>

188
00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:34.490
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is like the fourth one.</v>

189
00:08:34.491 --> 00:08:36.110
<v Speaker 1>So now I can look back like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

190
00:08:36.111 --> 00:08:37.970
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is growing,</v>

191
00:08:37.971 --> 00:08:40.420
<v Speaker 1>this is stuff I'm proud of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then if I'm writing something,</v>

192
00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:44.030
<v Speaker 1>like I just want to create as much as </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible.</v>

193
00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:45.640
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

194
00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:46.753
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

195
00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:49.340
<v Speaker 1>but there is definitely that side that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

196
00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:50.901
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

197
00:08:50.901 --> 00:08:51.734
<v Speaker 1>I came up during an era when you didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>just make an album because you could </v>

198
00:08:54.411 --> 00:08:57.330
<v Speaker 1>record it on your phone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone had to come and ask you,</v>

199
00:08:57.470 --> 00:08:59.670
<v Speaker 1>you have to be good enough for someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>to say,</v>

200
00:08:59.671 --> 00:09:00.504
<v Speaker 1>I want to make something with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I still have that feeling that I'm </v>

201
00:09:04.081 --> 00:09:04.914
<v Speaker 1>not good enough that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I don't want to put it out early </v>

202
00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:13.560
<v Speaker 1>because I don't feel like it's ready or </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's worthy,</v>

203
00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:14.423
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

204
00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:17.430
<v Speaker 1>So I try and hold back as much as </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible.</v>

205
00:09:17.431 --> 00:09:18.264
<v Speaker 1>I don't feel like because Louis puts one</v>
<v Speaker 1>out every year that I have to put one </v>

206
00:09:21.631 --> 00:09:25.890
<v Speaker 1>out every year or to be so arrogant that</v>
<v Speaker 1>will Carlin did it every year.</v>

207
00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:28.980
<v Speaker 1>Well that's George Carlin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Carlin.</v>

208
00:09:28.981 --> 00:09:33.060
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's hard to talk bad about </v>
<v Speaker 1>Carlin because he's dead and he's one of</v>

209
00:09:33.061 --> 00:09:34.810
<v Speaker 1>the all time greats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's some,</v>

210
00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:37.770
<v Speaker 1>some questionable stuff in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wasn't that good?</v>

211
00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:39.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some specials where.</v>

212
00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:40.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he had some brilliant jokes.</v>

213
00:09:40.921 --> 00:09:41.760
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no doubt about it.</v>

214
00:09:41.761 --> 00:09:43.830
<v Speaker 1>But when you're doing a new hour every </v>
<v Speaker 1>year,</v>

215
00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:47.640
<v Speaker 1>some of it's just not up to the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>standards as some of your classics.</v>

216
00:09:47.641 --> 00:09:50.190
<v Speaker 1>Like he has some classics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>

217
00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:52.230
<v Speaker 1>the best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

218
00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:56.370
<v Speaker 1>at the end he was calling himself a </v>
<v Speaker 1>writer more than a comedian.</v>

219
00:09:56.371 --> 00:09:57.204
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like to be called a writer and that's </v>

220
00:09:58.200 --> 00:09:59.430
<v Speaker 1>how he was doing the act.</v>

221
00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:00.263
<v Speaker 1>He was writing out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'd be at the comedy Magic Club with </v>

222
00:10:03.451 --> 00:10:06.630
<v Speaker 1>his printed out sheets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>memorizing like a play,</v>

223
00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:07.523
<v Speaker 1>like memorizing all this material to </v>
<v Speaker 1>then take it out and that's a different </v>

224
00:10:11.131 --> 00:10:13.350
<v Speaker 1>thing and you can put that together in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>year,</v>

225
00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:15.930
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't have the seasoning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the confidence,</v>

226
00:10:15.931 --> 00:10:20.280
<v Speaker 1>the ins and outs that if you just toured</v>
<v Speaker 1>with that for three years.</v>

227
00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:22.860
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What it would become.</v>

228
00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:24.660
<v Speaker 1>Tours is a big thing too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

229
00:10:24.661 --> 00:10:27.810
<v Speaker 1>because when I do a theater,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I do a theater on a weekend,</v>

230
00:10:27.811 --> 00:10:28.644
<v Speaker 1>like say if I do Friday night at a </v>
<v Speaker 1>theater or a Saturday night at the </v>

231
00:10:30.541 --> 00:10:33.240
<v Speaker 1>theater,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a giant difference between doing</v>

<v Speaker 1>you're like a mat.</v>

243
00:10:55.681 --> 00:10:56.514
<v Speaker 1>You can just kick back and just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's just this natural zone that you </v>

244
00:11:00.031 --> 00:11:03.810
<v Speaker 1>can be and that you don't have the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just don't have the confidence.</v>

245
00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:05.293
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to be out there all the time and </v>

246
00:11:07.021 --> 00:11:08.460
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the hard part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

247
00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:11.760
<v Speaker 1>Jay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>back to Jay doing the tonight show.</v>

248
00:11:11.761 --> 00:11:12.594
<v Speaker 1>He was working on that monologue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he was doing 12 minute </v>

249
00:11:16.021 --> 00:11:18.600
<v Speaker 1>monologues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They even just thrown those away.</v>

250
00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:20.270
<v Speaker 1>Let me just tell you this right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

251
00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:21.113
<v Speaker 1>I've never liked the fucking monologue </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever in the history of late night </v>

252
00:11:23.581 --> 00:11:24.414
<v Speaker 1>television is not one where I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>finally the monologue dog shit just go </v>

253
00:11:28.981 --> 00:11:31.140
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every joke sucks there.</v>

254
00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:33.120
<v Speaker 1>It's a different type of them using it </v>
<v Speaker 1>best,</v>

255
00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:35.610
<v Speaker 1>but he.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he would disagree because he,</v>

256
00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:36.613
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said that lead letterman was doing a </v>

257
00:11:39.481 --> 00:11:40.314
<v Speaker 1>six minute monologue and people were </v>
<v Speaker 1>turning off and go into the commercial </v>

258
00:11:42.721 --> 00:11:44.460
<v Speaker 1>and go onto the next thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he said,</v>

259
00:11:44.461 --> 00:11:46.530
<v Speaker 1>if I could keep it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I could do twice,</v>

260
00:11:46.531 --> 00:11:48.960
<v Speaker 1>that people aren't changing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

261
00:11:49.050 --> 00:11:52.590
<v Speaker 1>he beat Letterman all the time from that</v>
<v Speaker 1>segment of the show,</v>

262
00:11:53.430 --> 00:11:55.900
<v Speaker 1>the ratings were strong enough and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>held onto them.</v>

263
00:11:56.410 --> 00:11:57.243
<v Speaker 1>This is just as business mind working </v>
<v Speaker 1>that he hung onto them and kept them in </v>

264
00:12:00.521 --> 00:12:01.354
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's why he was number one all </v>

265
00:12:02.621 --> 00:12:03.950
<v Speaker 1>this time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

266
00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:08.340
<v Speaker 1>it was the hugh grant thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember when he ran on it,</v>

267
00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:10.210
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the hell were you thinking?</v>

268
00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:13.150
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is a disingenuous question.</v>

269
00:12:13.151 --> 00:12:13.984
<v Speaker 1>He was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to get my dick sucked by </v>

270
00:12:14.591 --> 00:12:17.200
<v Speaker 1>this hot black chick and I pay her </v>
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>

271
00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:18.590
<v Speaker 1>She's going to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just awesome.</v>

272
00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:20.013
<v Speaker 1>He knows what the fuck he taken.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But j dot really thought that the </v>

273
00:12:22.841 --> 00:12:27.841
<v Speaker 1>monologue was his was his thing and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had to pour everything into it and he</v>

274
00:12:28.571 --> 00:12:31.210
<v Speaker 1>would work on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As soon as that one was over,</v>

275
00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:33.850
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would fly off and do gigs in Vegas.</v>

276
00:12:33.851 --> 00:12:34.684
<v Speaker 1>He was working on it constantly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sending jokes to his guy coming in the </v>

277
00:12:37.871 --> 00:12:40.990
<v Speaker 1>next,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do 12 minutes of new jokes every day.</v>

278
00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:44.440
<v Speaker 1>You're not writing your act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not working on your act.</v>

279
00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:45.303
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you get busy and have other </v>

280
00:12:45.641 --> 00:12:47.470
<v Speaker 1>projects and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your acts,</v>

281
00:12:47.471 --> 00:12:48.304
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you've seen Craig Ferguson to stand </v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

285
00:12:56.710 --> 00:12:58.810
<v Speaker 1>and he was doing it while he was doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>the show.</v>

286
00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:02.080
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how much he did before he </v>
<v Speaker 1>did his show.</v>

287
00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:03.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then once he did a show,</v>

288
00:13:03.890 --> 00:13:05.410
<v Speaker 1>like I would go places and they said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's why I was asking you is what he </v>

298
00:13:17.111 --> 00:13:18.900
<v Speaker 1>does now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just decided I'd rather just do stand</v>

299
00:13:18.901 --> 00:13:19.780
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just.</v>

300
00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:21.040
<v Speaker 1>Here's a weird one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

301
00:13:21.490 --> 00:13:24.250
<v Speaker 1>They didn't get rid of him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he just said I want to do it anymore.</v>

302
00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:28.120
<v Speaker 1>I know he's one of the and then he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>hosting like two different game shows.</v>

303
00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:29.050
<v Speaker 1>Is He?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

304
00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:32.090
<v Speaker 1>What are they?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got this one show where it's like a</v>

305
00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:33.033
<v Speaker 1>kind of like two teams and they do </v>
<v Speaker 1>charades against each other kind of a </v>

306
00:13:36.881 --> 00:13:41.410
<v Speaker 1>show and he's in the middle of it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then I did an appearance on his new show</v>

307
00:13:41.411 --> 00:13:42.244
<v Speaker 1>on a national geographic or history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was history and he brought a </v>

308
00:13:46.061 --> 00:13:46.630
<v Speaker 1>panel out.</v>

309
00:13:46.630 --> 00:13:51.190
<v Speaker 1>It was me and lars from metallica and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>writer and we had discussed,</v>

310
00:13:51.250 --> 00:13:53.710
<v Speaker 1>it was like little lists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I forget the name of it.</v>

311
00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:54.573
<v Speaker 1>It was like the list of something and we</v>
<v Speaker 1>had to pick like the top five bands of </v>

312
00:13:56.981 --> 00:14:01.660
<v Speaker 1>all time and it's just like this funny </v>
<v Speaker 1>game show talk show kind of a thing,</v>

313
00:14:01.990 --> 00:14:05.440
<v Speaker 1>but he's always popping up and doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that kind of stuff.</v>

314
00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:08.020
<v Speaker 1>So he just didn't want to see what his </v>
<v Speaker 1>act was like because whenever.</v>

315
00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:09.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whenever I hear that.</v>

316
00:14:09.341 --> 00:14:10.174
<v Speaker 1>My first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My first inkling is always probably </v>

317
00:14:12.461 --> 00:14:16.250
<v Speaker 1>telling stories about celebrities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kathy Griffin style.</v>

318
00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:17.213
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you ever watch comedians and then </v>

319
00:14:19.650 --> 00:14:22.210
<v Speaker 1>become famous and then they start </v>
<v Speaker 1>telling stories about,</v>

320
00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:25.000
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is when I ran into so and so in the</v>

321
00:14:25.001 --> 00:14:27.330
<v Speaker 1>locker room and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all celebrity stuff because they're</v>

322
00:14:27.331 --> 00:14:29.770
<v Speaker 1>not living their life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But Ferguson,</v>

323
00:14:30.130 --> 00:14:30.963
<v Speaker 1>I had heard that like he used to write a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot and he was always trying to like </v>

324
00:14:33.871 --> 00:14:36.460
<v Speaker 1>come up with stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so maybe it's a real act.</v>

325
00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:38.253
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people that worked at the theater </v>

326
00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:43.630
<v Speaker 1>that I worked at or you know there the </v>
<v Speaker 1>night before they said it was funny.</v>

327
00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:45.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I would like to see it,</v>

328
00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:47.070
<v Speaker 1>see what that's about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I always,</v>

329
00:14:47.071 --> 00:14:48.700
<v Speaker 1>I always find it interesting when people</v>
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

330
00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:51.320
<v Speaker 1>they get some sort of a mainstream gig </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

331
00:14:51.321 --> 00:14:52.730
<v Speaker 1>And they do it for awhile and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>You're.</v>

401
00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:18.950
<v Speaker 1>That was a weird moment too in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>annals of Showbiz history when they gave</v>

402
00:17:18.951 --> 00:17:21.770
<v Speaker 1>him the Gig and then they put Leno on </v>
<v Speaker 1>before him.</v>

405
00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:26.773
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you guys are cannibalizing </v>

406
00:17:28.521 --> 00:17:29.990
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brutal.</v>

407
00:17:30.050 --> 00:17:31.460
<v Speaker 1>You have to talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Show hosts in a row.</v>

408
00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:34.520
<v Speaker 1>How do you choose who goes on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What show?</v>

<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what are you doing?</v>

410
00:17:36.050 --> 00:17:38.540
<v Speaker 1>Who did that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whose idea was that?</v>

411
00:17:38.690 --> 00:17:40.190
<v Speaker 1>Jeff Zucker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think Jeff.</v>

412
00:17:40.191 --> 00:17:41.024
<v Speaker 1>I Love Jeff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jeff's a great guy and I know Jeff gave </v>

413
00:17:42.471 --> 00:17:45.470
<v Speaker 1>me my first break on television,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was,</v>

414
00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:47.630
<v Speaker 1>holy cow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a weird moment.</v>

415
00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:48.710
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did.</v>

416
00:17:48.810 --> 00:17:50.330
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine if your cone.</v>

417
00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:52.710
<v Speaker 4>Imagine if you're the guy that you get </v>
<v Speaker 4>the tonight,</v>

418
00:17:52.711 --> 00:17:55.530
<v Speaker 4>show your lifelong dream and then the </v>
<v Speaker 4>guy you took it from,</v>

419
00:17:55.770 --> 00:17:59.010
<v Speaker 4>they tell you he's going to go on before</v>
<v Speaker 4>you because your ratings are so.</v>

420
00:17:59.011 --> 00:18:02.570
<v Speaker 4>So we're going to put him on at 10:00.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

421
00:18:03.170 --> 00:18:05.660
<v Speaker 4>and then you've got to go out there and </v>
<v Speaker 4>give them a log.</v>

422
00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:09.150
<v Speaker 4>How much time went by before they put </v>
<v Speaker 4>Leno on before?</v>

423
00:18:09.151 --> 00:18:10.470
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

424
00:18:10.710 --> 00:18:13.120
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't that long.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't give you much.</v>

425
00:18:13.210 --> 00:18:17.460
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't that long,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to say maybe a year maybe.</v>

426
00:18:17.850 --> 00:18:19.920
<v Speaker 4>But his,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it just wasn't hitting well.</v>

427
00:18:19.921 --> 00:18:23.220
<v Speaker 4>It's one of those things where to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in order for a show to develop,</v>

428
00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:26.160
<v Speaker 4>it has to find its legs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The guy like what?</v>

429
00:18:26.190 --> 00:18:28.830
<v Speaker 4>You have to have faith in whoever's </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing it that they're going to figure it</v>

430
00:18:28.831 --> 00:18:29.310
<v Speaker 4>out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

431
00:18:29.310 --> 00:18:30.000
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

432
00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.340
<v Speaker 4>But they don't always do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't always have faith.</v>

433
00:18:32.550 --> 00:18:34.440
<v Speaker 4>And then they put tremendous pressure on</v>
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>

434
00:18:34.710 --> 00:18:35.543
<v Speaker 4>And then advertisers don't want to spend</v>
<v Speaker 4>money because the ratings aren't high </v>

435
00:18:38.671 --> 00:18:41.130
<v Speaker 4>enough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you bleeding revenue and you have all</v>

436
00:18:41.131 --> 00:18:41.964
<v Speaker 4>these producers and everyone sketching.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everyone has their own idea of how to </v>

437
00:18:44.730 --> 00:18:49.730
<v Speaker 4>juice it up and then they have crashes </v>
<v Speaker 4>and pressure and what's so strange to me</v>

438
00:18:50.461 --> 00:18:52.050
<v Speaker 4>in that scenario when it was all going </v>
<v Speaker 4>down,</v>

439
00:18:52.051 --> 00:18:54.510
<v Speaker 4>when he had his thing in New York,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was locked in.</v>

440
00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:58.800
<v Speaker 4>He had his fans.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was solid and doing the same thing in</v>

441
00:18:58.801 --> 00:19:01.800
<v Speaker 4>a bigger studio across the country.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was different.</v>

442
00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:04.770
<v Speaker 4>It was weirder.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was area or something was.</v>

443
00:19:05.070 --> 00:19:08.340
<v Speaker 4>It was also on earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was more expectations.</v>

444
00:19:08.341 --> 00:19:12.810
<v Speaker 4>It was more mainstream expectations like</v>
<v Speaker 4>that late thing is kind of like relaxed.</v>

445
00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:13.673
<v Speaker 4>Like Carson Carson daily was on TV </v>
<v Speaker 4>forever and no one noticed and they </v>

446
00:19:16.621 --> 00:19:17.454
<v Speaker 4>still doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's still just kind of get away with </v>

447
00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:21.720
<v Speaker 4>that at 2:00</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the morning and just like,</v>

448
00:19:21.721 --> 00:19:22.840
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're good.</v>

449
00:19:23.110 --> 00:19:24.250
<v Speaker 4>See You tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't care,</v>

450
00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:25.470
<v Speaker 4>and we're still doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

451
00:19:25.471 --> 00:19:29.370
<v Speaker 4>for it's still buying time on that show.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Does Not Dishonor Carson Daly at all.</v>

452
00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:30.430
<v Speaker 4>It's very nice guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

453
00:19:30.450 --> 00:19:32.310
<v Speaker 4>but it's being protected.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're protected.</v>

454
00:19:32.311 --> 00:19:33.144
<v Speaker 4>You don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't have that pressure of </v>

455
00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:34.853
<v Speaker 4>expectations being in that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was there for the very early days of </v>

456
00:19:38.101 --> 00:19:42.090
<v Speaker 4>Conan because my friend Amir Mirror was </v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the writers on Conan show,</v>

457
00:19:42.210 --> 00:19:43.043
<v Speaker 4>so I went to like one of the third or </v>
<v Speaker 4>fourth tapings and when they had the </v>

458
00:19:47.791 --> 00:19:51.660
<v Speaker 4>monologue scripted and they had it on </v>
<v Speaker 4>giant cue cards,</v>

459
00:19:51.661 --> 00:19:52.494
<v Speaker 4>it was really gross for the audience </v>
<v Speaker 4>because right behind Andy Richter be </v>

460
00:19:56.611 --> 00:19:57.444
<v Speaker 4>someone holding a cue card and behind </v>
<v Speaker 4>Conan would be someone holding a cue </v>

461
00:19:59.971 --> 00:20:04.470
<v Speaker 4>card and it had like Conan Andy and then</v>
<v Speaker 4>yes.</v>

462
00:20:04.590 --> 00:20:05.423
<v Speaker 4>The words they would say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so they would have a scripted like this </v>

463
00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:09.710
<v Speaker 4>conversation were happening.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

464
00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:10.593
<v Speaker 4>Would be scripted.</v>

465
00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:12.030
<v Speaker 4>Weird,</v>
<v Speaker 4>bizarre.</v>

466
00:20:12.430 --> 00:20:15.430
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy is if there's a bizarre right</v>
<v Speaker 4>after you.</v>

467
00:20:15.570 --> 00:20:16.680
<v Speaker 4>Now you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now you go.</v>

468
00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:22.220
<v Speaker 4>It's funny you mentioned that because </v>
<v Speaker 4>our next guest is weird as well.</v>

469
00:20:22.870 --> 00:20:25.020
<v Speaker 4>Somebody had to go up to Kona to go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>listen,</v>

470
00:20:25.021 --> 00:20:29.460
<v Speaker 4>we need to script your monologue and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then we need to script your dialogue.</v>

471
00:20:29.490 --> 00:20:32.190
<v Speaker 4>We need to script your banter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We need to script everything.</v>

472
00:20:32.191 --> 00:20:33.570
<v Speaker 4>We're leaving.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nothing to chance.</v>

473
00:20:33.810 --> 00:20:35.970
<v Speaker 4>Just that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't good.</v>

474
00:20:36.450 --> 00:20:37.283
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was very awkward in the day and I </v>

475
00:20:39.241 --> 00:20:42.150
<v Speaker 4>think he found himself and became like </v>
<v Speaker 4>this sort of Zany.</v>

476
00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:46.710
<v Speaker 4>His show on guy is still super creative.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's still.</v>

477
00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:48.180
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you</v>

478
00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:49.013
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not that many people see it as compared </v>

479
00:20:51.161 --> 00:20:52.780
<v Speaker 1>to the old days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he'd,</v>

480
00:20:52.781 --> 00:20:55.180
<v Speaker 1>they're always doing original funny </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff like it.</v>

481
00:20:55.450 --> 00:20:56.770
<v Speaker 1>It's alive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

482
00:20:56.800 --> 00:21:00.040
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how you keep doing that for</v>
<v Speaker 1>that many years,</v>

483
00:21:00.041 --> 00:21:05.041
<v Speaker 1>but it is a unique really funny place on</v>
<v Speaker 1>television for sure.</v>

484
00:21:05.950 --> 00:21:07.810
<v Speaker 1>It's his job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's what he does.</v>

485
00:21:07.870 --> 00:21:09.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's his thing.</v>

486
00:21:09.161 --> 00:21:10.270
<v Speaker 1>That's his gig.</v>

<v Speaker 1>it's a.</v>

488
00:21:11.951 --> 00:21:12.784
<v Speaker 1>You know what else was awkward too?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the thing that sucks the most </v>

489
00:21:14.981 --> 00:21:17.980
<v Speaker 1>about those shows is that like you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>these six,</v>

490
00:21:17.990 --> 00:21:18.823
<v Speaker 1>seven minutes segments where you just </v>
<v Speaker 1>sit down and you just kind of force a </v>

491
00:21:22.391 --> 00:21:23.224
<v Speaker 1>bunch of subjects and to these sick like</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had drawn the other day and in one </v>

492
00:21:27.490 --> 00:21:30.130
<v Speaker 1>thing there was like this really awkward</v>
<v Speaker 1>segway.</v>

493
00:21:30.131 --> 00:21:32.590
<v Speaker 1>What about the NFL?</v>

495
00:21:33.161 --> 00:21:33.994
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they were just talking about trump </v>

496
00:21:36.341 --> 00:21:39.760
<v Speaker 1>and then they just switch gear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like super awkward segway.</v>

497
00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:41.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're looking down at the car,</v>

498
00:21:42.010 --> 00:21:43.090

<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

501
00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:47.013
<v Speaker 1>I really feel as a comedian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what comedians are the best </v>

502
00:21:48.611 --> 00:21:49.570
<v Speaker 1>guests on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those shows.</v>

503
00:21:49.571 --> 00:21:52.210
<v Speaker 1>Like you should just sit down and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just go.</v>

541
00:23:13.870 --> 00:23:18.070

<v Speaker 1>change it from.</v>

542
00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:20.410
<v Speaker 1>I used to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't catch a break,</v>

<v Speaker 1>And then he changed it to,</v>

545
00:23:25.460 --> 00:23:27.250
<v Speaker 1>I don't get no respect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no respect,</v>

546
00:23:27.251 --> 00:23:29.530
<v Speaker 1>no respect at all.</v>

547
00:23:29.590 --> 00:23:30.423
<v Speaker 1>see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see if he can find out the origin of </v>

548

<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie.</v>

549
00:23:32.350 --> 00:23:33.183
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was like a specific reason why he </v>

550
00:23:35.351 --> 00:23:40.090
<v Speaker 1>went to from like this one cat to </v>
<v Speaker 1>respect.</v>

551
00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:42.760
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to remember who told me.</v>

552
00:23:42.940 --> 00:23:46.490
<v Speaker 1>Someone who was like a giant Rodney Fan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was Dave Smith.</v>

553
00:23:46.491 --> 00:23:48.860
<v Speaker 1>Was it Dave Smith,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the comedian that came in here?</v>

554
00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:49.753
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So at some point he was saying things </v>

555
00:23:51.201 --> 00:23:53.470
<v Speaker 1>just don't go well for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something along wasn't.</v>

556
00:23:53.940 --> 00:23:55.670
<v Speaker 1>It just wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't that weird?</v>

557
00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:56.990
<v Speaker 1>Just those little words.</v>

558
00:23:56.990 --> 00:23:59.480
<v Speaker 1>Just those and catchy and get her done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get her done.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I mean her dad is a classic.</v>

560
00:24:01.780 --> 00:24:04.730
<v Speaker 1>Things are just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just catch why.</v>

561
00:24:04.731 --> 00:24:05.564
<v Speaker 1>Remember when Chappelle could not go on </v>
<v Speaker 1>stage because dumb drunk white boys </v>

562
00:24:09.980 --> 00:24:12.560
<v Speaker 1>would yell out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm Rick James Bitch.</v>

563
00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:15.960
<v Speaker 1>It was always white guys too because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they were so hooked on it.</v>

564
00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:17.080
<v Speaker 1>Hooked on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

565
00:24:17.090 --> 00:24:18.900
<v Speaker 1>Sorry Dave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>

566
00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:21.740
<v Speaker 1>White guys do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a white guy myself.</v>

567
00:24:21.770 --> 00:24:25.190
<v Speaker 1>So that was a giant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>giant problem.</v>

568
00:24:25.191 --> 00:24:29.360
<v Speaker 1>Like he would saw him at the House of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Blues in Vegas and literally show it was</v>

569
00:24:29.361 --> 00:24:31.830
<v Speaker 1>a clusterfuck because people just </v>
<v Speaker 1>yelling out,</v>

570
00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:33.560
<v Speaker 1>I'm Rick James,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bitch.</v>

571
00:24:34.010 --> 00:24:37.730
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's in the one side.</v>

572
00:24:37.731 --> 00:24:40.190
<v Speaker 1>It's like people love you so much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the other side he's like,</v>

573
00:24:40.191 --> 00:24:41.810
<v Speaker 1>you're killing me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're killing me.</v>

574
00:24:42.060 --> 00:24:44.810
<v Speaker 1>Well that was a saying that people love </v>
<v Speaker 1>to say.</v>

575
00:24:44.930 --> 00:24:47.450
<v Speaker 1>They just love to say I'm Rick James </v>
<v Speaker 1>Bitch.</v>

576
00:24:47.690 --> 00:24:50.480
<v Speaker 1>So they would just see them right there </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they just want to yell it out.</v>

577
00:24:50.540 --> 00:24:52.850
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to feel it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to feel that sound.</v>

578
00:24:52.970 --> 00:24:54.260
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sacha Baron Cohen.</v>

579
00:24:54.261 --> 00:24:55.580
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How long was he walking around?</v>

580
00:24:55.581 --> 00:24:57.620
<v Speaker 1>Like my wave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

581
00:24:57.950 --> 00:25:00.260
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no catchphrases.</v>

582
00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:02.300
<v Speaker 1>I always went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was young comic,</v>

583
00:25:02.301 --> 00:25:05.570
<v Speaker 1>I watched a guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I opened for some guy in like Virginia.</v>

584
00:25:05.571 --> 00:25:06.404
<v Speaker 1>It was like one of my first row things </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever and this guy was really hacky and </v>

585
00:25:10.521 --> 00:25:14.780
<v Speaker 1>he had a line in his act and then he </v>
<v Speaker 1>would sell the t shirt with that line.</v>

586
00:25:14.930 --> 00:25:17.480
<v Speaker 1>Oh God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he was also getting drunk,</v>

587
00:25:17.481 --> 00:25:19.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as for the second show.</v>

588
00:25:19.940 --> 00:25:20.773
<v Speaker 1>And he did the second show and brought </v>
<v Speaker 1>the tee shirt out at the end and there </v>

589
00:25:24.501 --> 00:25:26.990
<v Speaker 1>was no response because he had forgot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was so drunk.</v>

590
00:25:26.991 --> 00:25:30.470
<v Speaker 1>He forgot to do the hacky bit to sell </v>
<v Speaker 1>his t shirt.</v>

591
00:25:31.550 --> 00:25:32.383
<v Speaker 1>I saw that and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't care how much money he's making </v>

592
00:25:34.851 --> 00:25:37.670
<v Speaker 1>him selling these shirts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am not going down that road.</v>

593
00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.370
<v Speaker 1>That's a big thing though for road guys </v>
<v Speaker 1>is merge,</v>

594
00:25:41.270 --> 00:25:42.990
<v Speaker 1>merge.</v>

595
00:25:43.950 --> 00:25:45.480

<v Speaker 1>Such a bad businessman.</v>

596
00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:47.960
<v Speaker 1>I just feel like it's all about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>

597
00:25:47.990 --> 00:25:49.790
<v Speaker 1>It's about the show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about me on stage.</v>

598
00:25:49.970 --> 00:25:54.050
<v Speaker 1>This was great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't go to the lobby and start making</v>

599
00:25:54.051 --> 00:25:55.940
<v Speaker 1>change for twenties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't do it.</v>

600

<v Speaker 1>Can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've sold t shirts and like one or two </v>

<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

622
00:26:48.961 --> 00:26:53.961
<v Speaker 3>minutes while on this disk drive.</v>

<v Speaker 5>People want to take,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like I went to see,</v>

<v Speaker 5>like we're standing there watching the </v>

669
00:28:41.171 --> 00:28:42.004
<v Speaker 5>show and people were grabbing my arm,</v>
<v Speaker 5>trying to get me to take pictures with </v>

670
00:28:45.041 --> 00:28:45.500
<v Speaker 5>him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>That beginning of,</v>

673
00:28:48.661 --> 00:28:49.860
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of your special.</v>

674
00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:54.920
<v Speaker 3>The first thing you said was put your </v>
<v Speaker 3>phone down yet because there's special.</v>

675
00:28:55.651 --> 00:28:59.160
<v Speaker 3>Literally the first thing out of your </v>
<v Speaker 3>mouth was put your phone.</v>

676
00:28:59.161 --> 00:29:01.450
<v Speaker 3>They can't be in the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bitch.</v>

677
00:29:01.450 --> 00:29:02.283
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>meanwhile I'd take videos of Gary Clark </v>

678
00:29:04.601 --> 00:29:09.601
<v Speaker 5>when he's on stage of the day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know it's all part of the experience,</v>

679
00:29:09.850 --> 00:29:12.070
<v Speaker 5>but I wanted to promote them to c,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one,</v>

680
00:29:12.280 --> 00:29:14.200
<v Speaker 5>six explained.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

681
00:29:14.230 --> 00:29:16.000
<v Speaker 5>the origin of respect.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Here it goes.</v>

682
00:29:16.300 --> 00:29:18.670
<v Speaker 5>I had this joke,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I play hide and seek won't even look for</v>

683
00:29:18.671 --> 00:29:21.490
<v Speaker 5>me to make it worse.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He looked for something and put in front</v>

684
00:29:21.491 --> 00:29:22.510
<v Speaker 5>of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was so poor.</v>

685
00:29:22.511 --> 00:29:24.070
<v Speaker 5>I was so dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So this.</v>

686
00:29:24.340 --> 00:29:27.400
<v Speaker 5>So that I thought now what fits that </v>
<v Speaker 5>joke?</v>

687
00:29:27.550 --> 00:29:31.690
<v Speaker 5>Well no one liked me was all right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but then I thought a more profound thing</v>

688
00:29:31.691 --> 00:29:33.220
<v Speaker 5>would be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I get no respect.</v>

689
00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:37.720
<v Speaker 5>That's not totally true.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was a movie,</v>

690
00:29:38.430 --> 00:29:40.870
<v Speaker 5>there was something,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there was a movie about some,</v>

691
00:29:40.890 --> 00:29:41.723
<v Speaker 5>some movie that had something about </v>
<v Speaker 5>respect in it is wikipedia says pretty </v>

692
00:29:45.281 --> 00:29:48.580
<v Speaker 5>much the same thing that it came from </v>
<v Speaker 5>like appearances on the Ed Sullivan show</v>

693
00:29:49.210 --> 00:29:51.400
<v Speaker 5>and that this is like almost the same </v>
<v Speaker 5>thing.</v>

694
00:29:51.401 --> 00:29:52.530
<v Speaker 5>It tells a joke right here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

<v Speaker 5>deciding respect,</v>

697
00:29:58.510 --> 00:30:01.030

<v Speaker 5>famous at the time,</v>

698
00:30:01.031 --> 00:30:02.380
<v Speaker 5>like maybe even a mob movie.</v>

699
00:30:04.130 --> 00:30:05.520
<v Speaker 1>It's weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when you look at listening,</v>

700
00:30:05.580 --> 00:30:06.413

00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:33.150
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Four.</v>

712
00:30:35.820 --> 00:30:38.070
<v Speaker 1>Oh my goodness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's when I realized I was like,</v>

713
00:30:38.071 --> 00:30:43.071
<v Speaker 1>what your family tree does not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fork is one of those.</v>

714
00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:44.581
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

715
00:30:44.581 --> 00:30:45.840
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>

716
00:30:46.490 --> 00:30:48.000
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

717
00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:53.190
<v Speaker 1>I feel like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the taking the picture is kind of better</v>

718
00:30:53.191 --> 00:30:58.191
<v Speaker 1>than talking to them though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I always find like I want to.</v>

719
00:30:59.490 --> 00:31:03.150
<v Speaker 1>They'll say something about the act or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something and then the first sentence is</v>

720
00:31:03.151 --> 00:31:03.750
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>

721
00:31:03.750 --> 00:31:04.290
<v Speaker 1>Be Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

722
00:31:04.290 --> 00:31:05.820
<v Speaker 1>it was really funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love when you did the thing.</v>

723
00:31:05.821 --> 00:31:06.451
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's good.</v>

724
00:31:06.451 --> 00:31:10.350
<v Speaker 1>I've been working on that and then I </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to talk real about it,</v>

725
00:31:10.740 --> 00:31:11.573
<v Speaker 1>about the act and then they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always find myself like they meet you </v>

726
00:31:14.401 --> 00:31:15.181
<v Speaker 1>and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh this is great.</v>

727
00:31:15.181 --> 00:31:16.014
<v Speaker 1>I get to talk to them and then you start</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking and then they ended up slowly </v>

728
00:31:18.481 --> 00:31:21.780
<v Speaker 1>walking away and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been really working on this bit.</v>

729
00:31:22.110 --> 00:31:25.920
<v Speaker 1>I'm having a hard time with the tag and </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to just kind of drift away.</v>

730
00:31:25.921 --> 00:31:27.000
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

731
00:31:27.030 --> 00:31:29.430
<v Speaker 1>he's not as much fun as we thought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

732
00:31:29.431 --> 00:31:31.500
<v Speaker 1>you mean you didn't just make that up on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the spot.</v>

733
00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:35.280
<v Speaker 1>So I feel like if they take a picture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'd get through it and move on.</v>

734
00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:36.753
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well Jamie and I do this thing that I </v>

735
00:31:39.461 --> 00:31:44.140
<v Speaker 5>stole from Steevo Steve Idea.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a great idea.</v>

736
00:31:44.230 --> 00:31:45.063
<v Speaker 5>Steve takes photos,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but then you have to go to his website </v>

737
00:31:47.501 --> 00:31:48.334
<v Speaker 5>to get the photos.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That way people don't fumble with their </v>

738
00:31:49.691 --> 00:31:52.750
<v Speaker 5>cameras and I tried them once because </v>
<v Speaker 5>the phones take fucking.</v>

739
00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:54.160
<v Speaker 5>Nobody knows how to use her God damn </v>
<v Speaker 5>phone.</v>

740
00:31:54.190 --> 00:31:54.971
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>take my picture.</v>

741
00:31:54.971 --> 00:31:57.130
<v Speaker 5>How does this work?</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you give someone an android phone,</v>

742
00:31:57.340 --> 00:31:59.260
<v Speaker 5>you might as well give him a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>thesaurus.</v>

743
00:31:59.830 --> 00:32:00.663
<v Speaker 5>Give them a book to read.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nobody knows how to work a fucking </v>

744
00:32:03.041 --> 00:32:03.650
<v Speaker 5>android phone.</v>

745
00:32:03.650 --> 00:32:06.200
<v Speaker 1>I tried to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had my buddy take pictures and then we</v>

746
00:32:06.201 --> 00:32:08.660
<v Speaker 1>posted them on the line and they could </v>
<v Speaker 1>go get them.</v>

747
00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:09.673
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody was so then you spent the </v>

748
00:32:10.821 --> 00:32:12.920
<v Speaker 1>whole time saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can I just take it with my phone,</v>

749
00:32:13.100 --> 00:32:14.860
<v Speaker 1>knows how we do it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got iris.</v>

750
00:32:15.570 --> 00:32:18.060
<v Speaker 5>Say that a higher one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Security people at the club say,</v>

751
00:32:18.270 --> 00:32:19.103
<v Speaker 5>put your phones away.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The pictures will be available online </v>

752
00:32:21.451 --> 00:32:22.284
<v Speaker 5>tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is the only way to do what you do </v>

753
00:32:23.581 --> 00:32:25.470
<v Speaker 5>in thousands of photos though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's only one way.</v>

754
00:32:25.580 --> 00:32:26.151
<v Speaker 1>Do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

755
00:32:26.151 --> 00:32:26.984
<v Speaker 1>if you're doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why I sit in the back and eat a </v>

756
00:32:28.341 --> 00:32:30.260
<v Speaker 1>salad and wait for the second show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's good.</v>

757
00:32:30.261 --> 00:32:31.940
<v Speaker 1>Move too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that's a good move.</v>

758
00:32:32.250 --> 00:32:34.170
<v Speaker 5>I know it depends on where you're at too</v>
<v Speaker 5>though.</v>

759
00:32:34.830 --> 00:32:35.663
<v Speaker 5>Like that's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you like comedy clubs or do you like </v>

760
00:32:37.290 --> 00:32:39.060
<v Speaker 5>working theaters like this place in </v>
<v Speaker 5>Cleveland?</v>

761
00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:39.913
<v Speaker 5>How many seats were there?</v>

762
00:32:40.300 --> 00:32:42.180
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was about 600.</v>

763
00:32:42.290 --> 00:32:43.820
<v Speaker 1>That's a good time or something like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

764
00:32:43.850 --> 00:32:44.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was perfect.</v>

765
00:32:44.961 --> 00:32:47.570
<v Speaker 1>Perfect size.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did the fillmore in San Francisco.</v>

766
00:32:47.571 --> 00:32:49.220
<v Speaker 1>That's where I did my special,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is smaller than that.</v>

767
00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:50.840
<v Speaker 1>It's like 4:50,</v>
<v Speaker 1>4:50.</v>

768
00:32:50.870 --> 00:32:52.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Perfect.</v>

769
00:32:52.390 --> 00:32:52.911
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's good.</v>

770
00:32:52.911 --> 00:32:53.290
<v Speaker 1>It's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>

771
00:32:53.290 --> 00:32:57.080
<v Speaker 1>It's perfect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not as good as the comedy works</v>

772
00:32:57.110 --> 00:32:59.440
<v Speaker 1>because the economy works is a low </v>
<v Speaker 1>ceiling like,</v>

773
00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:00.650
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a high ceiling.</v>

774
00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:02.360
<v Speaker 1>Low ceilings are where it's at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

775
00:33:02.361 --> 00:33:06.170
<v Speaker 1>Those little jammed up like there's no </v>
<v Speaker 1>room at the comedy store rooms.</v>

776
00:33:06.740 --> 00:33:11.240
<v Speaker 1>People don't realize what that energy is</v>
<v Speaker 1>such a real real thing.</v>

777
00:33:11.330 --> 00:33:15.620
<v Speaker 1>It is a real thing given back and forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're writing this.</v>

778
00:33:15.621 --> 00:33:18.230
<v Speaker 1>There's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a mystical just.</v>

779
00:33:18.231 --> 00:33:20.750
<v Speaker 1>It's a real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm getting from them.</v>

780
00:33:20.810 --> 00:33:23.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm giving it back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're playing with this energy.</v>

781
00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:27.200
<v Speaker 1>That's why if you do an outdoor show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it sucks because it's just poof.</v>

782
00:33:27.590 --> 00:33:29.780
<v Speaker 1>Just evaporating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going up like smoke.</v>

783
00:33:30.140 --> 00:33:32.060
<v Speaker 1>One thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you have any hecklers?</v>

784
00:33:32.710 --> 00:33:33.600
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

785
00:33:33.710 --> 00:33:34.543
<v Speaker 1>Three out of four shows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People heckled really three of the four </v>

786
00:33:37.070 --> 00:33:38.720
<v Speaker 1>and they weren't even being mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were just.</v>

787
00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:41.590
<v Speaker 1>They wanted to talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just wanted to get on the show.</v>

788
00:33:41.690 --> 00:33:43.790
<v Speaker 1>They love you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even asked people before the show,</v>

789
00:33:43.791 --> 00:33:44.960
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm filming here.</v>

790
00:33:45.230 --> 00:33:46.880
<v Speaker 1>Please don't yell on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anything.</v>

791
00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:51.470
<v Speaker 1>They still did probably so mad at them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People were so mad at them.</v>

792
00:33:51.560 --> 00:33:53.240
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

793
00:33:53.241 --> 00:33:54.910
<v Speaker 1>And then the crates this riff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people like,</v>

794
00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:59.380
<v Speaker 1>shut the fuck up.</v>

<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

796
00:34:00.110 --> 00:34:00.943

<v Speaker 1>Maybe your people are more civilized </v>

797
00:34:02.961 --> 00:34:04.190
<v Speaker 1>than other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're middle aged women.</v>

798
00:34:04.310 --> 00:34:07.340
<v Speaker 1>They might get a lot of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get a lot of,</v>

820
00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:05.750

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chris was joking around with them at </v>

827
00:35:20.781 --> 00:35:24.170
<v Speaker 1>first and then the guy interrupted again</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then Chris was like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>You can definitely have an opinion.</v>

834
00:35:37.020 --> 00:35:38.250
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to interrupt</v>

835
00:35:38.250 --> 00:35:42.210
<v Speaker 4>a performance like this agreement.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The audience has an agreement.</v>

836
00:35:42.211 --> 00:35:43.044
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The agreement is you're going to sit </v>

<v Speaker 4>person is prepared right now.</v>

838
00:35:47.010 --> 00:35:47.843
<v Speaker 4>Person's prepared,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he came on stage with a fucking </v>

839
00:35:49.381 --> 00:35:51.210
<v Speaker 4>notebook,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's a weird thing,</v>

840
00:35:51.211 --> 00:35:52.044
<v Speaker 4>but that's the.</v>

841
00:35:52.150 --> 00:35:53.450
<v Speaker 3>That's the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

842
00:35:53.860 --> 00:35:56.380
<v Speaker 3>that's the illusion that we create.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're good.</v>

843
00:35:56.500 --> 00:35:58.750
<v Speaker 3>It does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It sounds like it's just happening.</v>

844
00:35:58.780 --> 00:36:01.930
<v Speaker 3>It sounds like it's in the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't sound planned out,</v>

845
00:36:02.110 --> 00:36:03.940
<v Speaker 3>so they think that they're in the moment</v>
<v Speaker 3>with you.</v>

846
00:36:04.350 --> 00:36:07.200
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>rock rock is so opinion heavy.</v>

847
00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:10.320
<v Speaker 4>Like Chris Rock's premises are always </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>premise,</v>

850
00:36:14.190 --> 00:36:18.660
<v Speaker 4>taking a controversial point of view and</v>
<v Speaker 4>then bring it around so that when at the</v>

851
00:36:18.660 --> 00:36:19.493
<v Speaker 4>end of it you're just howling laughing </v>
<v Speaker 4>because he's figured out a way to like </v>

<v Speaker 4>he's right.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Brutal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he was talking about how that's why </v>

869
00:37:14.390 --> 00:37:16.600

<v Speaker 4>a third,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it's a fucking scam.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Let's just take the house,</v>

890
00:38:14.121 --> 00:38:16.130
<v Speaker 3>the cash,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the bows and arrows.</v>

891
00:38:16.700 --> 00:38:21.700
<v Speaker 3>It's all gone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Could Joe Rogan go live in?</v>

892
00:38:22.740 --> 00:38:24.930
<v Speaker 3>Let's just pick New York.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is not a silly question,</v>

893
00:38:25.110 --> 00:38:25.943
<v Speaker 3>but let's pick New York.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Could you go live down by Washington </v>

894
00:38:28.860 --> 00:38:30.690
<v Speaker 3>Square Park in a studio,</v>
<v Speaker 3>apartment,</v>

895
00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:34.040
<v Speaker 3>Heavier Act.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have your fans go do your thing and kind</v>

896
00:38:34.041 --> 00:38:36.040
<v Speaker 3>of be okay with a low bank account or</v>

897
00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:38.700
<v Speaker 4>have you got.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are you at an age now and you've,</v>

898
00:38:39.150 --> 00:38:39.983
<v Speaker 4>you've had stability.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you feel like that would freak you </v>

899
00:38:41.981 --> 00:38:43.270
<v Speaker 4>out?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

900
00:38:43.271 --> 00:38:46.510
<v Speaker 4>it would definitely freak you out if you</v>
<v Speaker 4>all the sudden,</v>

901
00:38:46.511 --> 00:38:51.511
<v Speaker 4>like one of the things that I've sort of</v>
<v Speaker 4>relied on is not needing anything.</v>

902
00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:54.820
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So by not needing anything,</v>

903
00:38:54.821 --> 00:38:56.920
<v Speaker 4>everything I do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do because I enjoy it.</v>

904
00:38:56.950 --> 00:38:59.260
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So like if I do stand up I do it because</v>

905
00:38:59.261 --> 00:39:00.094
<v Speaker 4>I enjoy it and if I do podcasts because </v>
<v Speaker 4>I enjoy it if I do the UFC is because I </v>

906
00:39:03.791 --> 00:39:05.660
<v Speaker 4>enjoyed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I enjoyed the money is done.</v>

907
00:39:05.710 --> 00:39:06.870
<v Speaker 4>Don't get me wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>

908
00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:09.280
<v Speaker 4>But I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not needy.</v>

909
00:39:09.340 --> 00:39:10.173
<v Speaker 4>I'm not in a position where I'm like </v>
<v Speaker 4>worried about my next check so that </v>

910
00:39:12.611 --> 00:39:14.290
<v Speaker 4>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if I got to that.</v>

911
00:39:14.350 --> 00:39:14.840
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

912
00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:15.673
<v Speaker 4>not even need that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like neither stuff is kind of like if </v>

913
00:39:18.761 --> 00:39:19.594
<v Speaker 4>you have a car and you can get around,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you've got food on the table and your </v>

914
00:39:22.121 --> 00:39:23.230
<v Speaker 4>family's taken care of.</v>

915
00:39:23.680 --> 00:39:26.650
<v Speaker 4>Everything else is kind of bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's nice.</v>

916
00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:28.420
<v Speaker 4>It's nice to have a good couch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

917
00:39:28.421 --> 00:39:30.280
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we have a 70 inch TV.</v>

918
00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:31.930
<v Speaker 4>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is nice.</v>

919
00:39:32.020 --> 00:39:35.530
<v Speaker 4>It feels nice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But Watch westworld and a 70 inch TV.</v>

920
00:39:35.531 --> 00:39:36.940
<v Speaker 4>It's nice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look how big it is.</v>

921
00:39:36.941 --> 00:39:37.774
<v Speaker 4>Woo.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

922
00:39:37.990 --> 00:39:41.890
<v Speaker 4>But ultimately what really counts is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are you nervous?</v>

923
00:39:42.100 --> 00:39:43.790
<v Speaker 4>Are you nervous about your bills?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because like,</v>

924
00:39:44.030 --> 00:39:45.940
<v Speaker 4>do you remember that feeling?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

925
00:39:46.520 --> 00:39:50.290
<v Speaker 4>that sounds terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Feeling worried about where that's gonna</v>

926
00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:53.740
<v Speaker 4>come from and what you're going to do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you still have your act.</v>

927
00:39:53.770 --> 00:39:54.603
<v Speaker 4>You can still go make money,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we're going to put you back at </v>

928
00:39:56.741 --> 00:39:57.574
<v Speaker 4>square one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're going to put you in that studio </v>

929
00:39:58.661 --> 00:39:59.494
<v Speaker 4>apartment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Could you,</v>

930
00:39:59.770 --> 00:40:00.603
<v Speaker 4>would you be cool with it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Studios kind of small one like a four </v>

931
00:40:03.730 --> 00:40:05.730
<v Speaker 4>bedroom house with a yard and some </v>
<v Speaker 4>working.</v>

932
00:40:05.770 --> 00:40:08.950
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but honestly the big thing,</v>

933
00:40:08.951 --> 00:40:09.784
<v Speaker 4>and this is such a cliche,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the big thing is do I still have my </v>

934
00:40:11.921 --> 00:40:12.754
<v Speaker 4>friends?</v>

935
00:40:13.330 --> 00:40:14.163
<v Speaker 4>Do I still have the same friends?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because if I lived in an apartment </v>

936
00:40:16.391 --> 00:40:17.224
<v Speaker 4>building and Ari Shaffir lived next door</v>
<v Speaker 4>and Duncan lived down the hallway and </v>

937
00:40:20.081 --> 00:40:22.270
<v Speaker 4>joey was over the other side.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

938
00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:23.570
<v Speaker 4>I don't have a great time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

939
00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:26.140
<v Speaker 4>We all lived on the same floor,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the same building.</v>

940
00:40:26.170 --> 00:40:28.480
<v Speaker 4>I would have zero problem with that if </v>
<v Speaker 4>they knocked on the door.</v>

941
00:40:28.481 --> 00:40:29.291
<v Speaker 4>Hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you got any weed?</v>

942
00:40:29.291 --> 00:40:30.740
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to wait.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Come on know.</v>

943
00:40:30.850 --> 00:40:33.160
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That would be no problem at all.</v>

944
00:40:33.161 --> 00:40:33.994
<v Speaker 4>It's like how much different is that </v>
<v Speaker 4>than when you stay on the road in the </v>

945
00:40:35.921 --> 00:40:36.754
<v Speaker 4>hotel?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because the hotel is like a studio </v>

946
00:40:38.111 --> 00:40:38.944
<v Speaker 4>apartment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

947
00:40:39.050 --> 00:40:41.380
<v Speaker 4>and you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Good percentage of our lives.</v>

948
00:40:41.530 --> 00:40:43.800
<v Speaker 4>We stay in a studio apartment a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know that.</v>

949
00:40:43.830 --> 00:40:44.740
<v Speaker 4>I really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

950
00:40:44.770 --> 00:40:48.070
<v Speaker 4>I bring it up because I really.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was thinking about it and it's like if</v>

951
00:40:48.071 --> 00:40:48.904
<v Speaker 4>it all fell apart like you grew up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you grab on to your lifestyle and what </v>

952
00:40:52.001 --> 00:40:56.140
<v Speaker 4>you're doing so hard,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if at all for whatever reason washed</v>

953
00:40:56.141 --> 00:40:59.740
<v Speaker 4>away and you still go perform and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>still had your friends at this club,</v>

954
00:40:59.741 --> 00:41:01.800
<v Speaker 4>you could see what it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

955
00:41:01.900 --> 00:41:03.730
<v Speaker 4>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I could totally do it.</v>

956
00:41:03.940 --> 00:41:08.940
<v Speaker 4>I could totally go back to I have </v>
<v Speaker 4>clothes that fit in this big of a closet</v>

957
00:41:10.570 --> 00:41:13.330
<v Speaker 4>and just and just keep doing what I'm </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing,</v>

958
00:41:13.331 --> 00:41:15.820
<v Speaker 4>but in those circumstances I 100 </v>
<v Speaker 4>percent.</v>

959
00:41:16.030 --> 00:41:19.210
<v Speaker 4>In some ways I think your.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You'd be lighter.</v>

960
00:41:19.660 --> 00:41:23.110
<v Speaker 4>You'd be right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of people do believe that in a lot</v>

961
00:41:23.111 --> 00:41:26.350
<v Speaker 4>of people do go towards that minimalism </v>
<v Speaker 4>life where they give up everything.</v>

962
00:41:26.650 --> 00:41:28.810
<v Speaker 4>My friend Steve Maxwell,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's a,</v>

963
00:41:28.870 --> 00:41:31.690

967
00:41:37.860 --> 00:41:38.790
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw that guy.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

00:41:40.130 --> 00:41:40.963
<v Speaker 5>he used to have a big house and he had a</v>
<v Speaker 5>gym in Philadelphia you'd like one of </v>

971
00:41:44.651 --> 00:41:45.484
<v Speaker 5>the very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's one of the very first American </v>

972
00:41:46.511 --> 00:41:47.344
<v Speaker 5>Brazilian Jiu Jitsu black belt and he </v>
<v Speaker 5>had this gigantic jam where he's </v>

973
00:41:50.051 --> 00:41:51.870
<v Speaker 5>teaching and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

974
00:41:52.060 --> 00:41:52.893
<v Speaker 5>he's an interesting guy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then he just decided he got </v>

975
00:41:54.191 --> 00:41:55.170
<v Speaker 5>divorced,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

976
00:41:55.480 --> 00:41:56.440
<v Speaker 5>And he decided,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know what,</v>

977
00:41:57.190 --> 00:41:58.210
<v Speaker 5>fuck this.</v>

00:41:58.211 --> 00:41:59.044
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to live out of a van.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he got like a camper van and he </v>

979
00:42:02.261 --> 00:42:04.120
<v Speaker 5>lived out of that and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fuck this van.</v>

980
00:42:04.150 --> 00:42:04.983
<v Speaker 5>I'm getting,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm just going to keep traveling really </v>

981
00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:08.870
<v Speaker 5>now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He just stays in hotels everywhere.</v>

982
00:42:08.990 --> 00:42:11.000
<v Speaker 3>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's what brings it up.</v>

983
00:42:11.001 --> 00:42:12.000
<v Speaker 3>It's the divorce.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see.</v>

984
00:42:12.550 --> 00:42:15.110
<v Speaker 3>I don't think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think willingly I would do it,</v>

985
00:42:15.111 --> 00:42:17.600
<v Speaker 3>but if something was thrust upon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if you got divorced,</v>

986
00:42:17.630 --> 00:42:21.010
<v Speaker 3>divorce or some something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would uh,</v>

987
00:42:21.620 --> 00:42:23.270
<v Speaker 3>I could go back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could be like,</v>

988
00:42:23.460 --> 00:42:24.293
<v Speaker 5>do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you're thinking about it so much </v>

989
00:42:24.841 --> 00:42:27.180
<v Speaker 5>that you brought it up as a subject,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but this is something you wonder.</v>

990
00:42:27.610 --> 00:42:29.440
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

991
00:42:29.441 --> 00:42:32.590
<v Speaker 3>Not as far as the divorce part of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but just the simple life.</v>

992
00:42:32.620 --> 00:42:33.453
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I've built a life that's bigger </v>

993
00:42:35.560 --> 00:42:38.530
<v Speaker 3>and more complicated and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

994
00:42:38.590 --> 00:42:40.600
<v Speaker 3>you want to know what you want to know </v>
<v Speaker 3>what it was.</v>

995
00:42:41.770 --> 00:42:42.603
<v Speaker 3>Last time I was in here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had had this back issue where it was </v>

996
00:42:45.011 --> 00:42:47.330
<v Speaker 3>like shooting pain down my arm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>crackpot and it doesn't work and all </v>

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1014
00:43:28.991 --> 00:43:29.824
<v Speaker 3>what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just basically about that you're </v>

1015
00:43:30.551 --> 00:43:31.384
<v Speaker 3>carrying your brain wants to go to work </v>
<v Speaker 3>on something simple like pain in your </v>

1016
00:43:35.231 --> 00:43:36.064
<v Speaker 3>body rather than deal with issues of </v>
<v Speaker 3>stress and anxiety and anger that you </v>

1017
00:43:40.331 --> 00:43:41.164
<v Speaker 3>carry all the time and basically just </v>
<v Speaker 3>realizing that that's where the pain is </v>

1018
00:43:44.471 --> 00:43:45.304
<v Speaker 3>coming from.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't have to solve the anxiety or the </v>

1019
00:43:47.261 --> 00:43:50.710
<v Speaker 3>pain or the anger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just have to be aware of,</v>

1020
00:43:50.980 --> 00:43:51.701
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>brain,</v>

1021
00:43:51.701 --> 00:43:53.950
<v Speaker 3>I know what you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know what you're working on.</v>

1022
00:43:54.760 --> 00:43:55.593
<v Speaker 3>It just kind of alleviates that stress.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the physical manifestation of </v>

1023
00:43:59.381 --> 00:44:00.214
<v Speaker 3>not having oxygen go into your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>into your muscles and stuff starts to </v>

1024
00:44:04.391 --> 00:44:08.050
<v Speaker 3>slowly release and just it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's gone.</v>

1025
00:44:08.590 --> 00:44:09.700
<v Speaker 3>It's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's.</v>

1026
00:44:09.910 --> 00:44:11.530
<v Speaker 3>I have no pain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have no.</v>

1027
00:44:11.590 --> 00:44:14.440
<v Speaker 3>How long did it take after you read the </v>
<v Speaker 3>book and adopted the principles?</v>

1028
00:44:14.530 --> 00:44:16.330
<v Speaker 3>Like a month and a half.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

1029
00:44:16.390 --> 00:44:19.210
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So a year of pain and then a month and a</v>

1030
00:44:19.211 --> 00:44:21.670
<v Speaker 3>half of adopting these principles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what does he tell you to do?</v>

1031
00:44:21.671 --> 00:44:23.770
<v Speaker 3>Like what are the exercises that he </v>
<v Speaker 3>tells you to do?</v>

1032
00:44:24.100 --> 00:44:25.440
<v Speaker 3>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just live.</v>

1033
00:44:25.540 --> 00:44:29.260
<v Speaker 3>Don't just a live your life exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whatever you were doing,</v>

1034
00:44:29.261 --> 00:44:31.090
<v Speaker 3>do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't live timidly.</v>

1035
00:44:31.410 --> 00:44:32.243
<v Speaker 3>Think I can't run now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't do yoga now because I've got a </v>

1036
00:44:34.741 --> 00:44:37.290
<v Speaker 3>neck issue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do it live your life.</v>

1037
00:44:37.320 --> 00:44:38.153
<v Speaker 3>Don't live like in this preventative way</v>
<v Speaker 3>of I can't move or I'm going to mess up </v>

1038
00:44:41.551 --> 00:44:42.750
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my body.</v>

1039
00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:45.590
<v Speaker 5>So what does he tell you about?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like physical issues.</v>

1040
00:44:45.591 --> 00:44:49.040
<v Speaker 5>Like what if you have a herniated disc </v>
<v Speaker 5>and it's pressing against your nerve and</v>

1041
00:44:49.041 --> 00:44:51.740
<v Speaker 5>it's causing your hands to go numb and </v>
<v Speaker 5>your arms atrophying.</v>

1042
00:44:51.760 --> 00:44:54.070
<v Speaker 3>He says there's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those are very rare cases.</v>

1043
00:44:54.370 --> 00:44:56.500
<v Speaker 3>It's not that rare in my world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

1044
00:44:56.560 --> 00:44:57.131
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1045
00:44:57.131 --> 00:44:58.480
<v Speaker 3>you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he said,</v>

1046
00:44:58.510 --> 00:44:59.343
<v Speaker 3>he says it's very rare cases where </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's like a real pinched nerve kind </v>

1047
00:45:03.281 --> 00:45:04.114
<v Speaker 3>of a problem.</v>

1048
00:45:04.680 --> 00:45:05.513
<v Speaker 5>It seems like crazy advice.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know a lot of people that have like </v>

1049
00:45:07.950 --> 00:45:10.200
<v Speaker 5>real issues,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like real physical issues.</v>

1050
00:45:10.201 --> 00:45:14.040
<v Speaker 5>It's not a rare thing to have.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like disc issues are gigantic.</v>

1051
00:45:14.100 --> 00:45:15.690
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because people,</v>

1052
00:45:15.930 --> 00:45:17.400
<v Speaker 5>they don't strengthen their spine </v>
<v Speaker 5>enough.</v>

1053
00:45:17.401 --> 00:45:20.490
<v Speaker 5>They don't drink near core enough and </v>
<v Speaker 5>they wind up doing something.</v>

1054
00:45:20.491 --> 00:45:21.720
<v Speaker 5>They Yank it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they heard it,</v>

1055
00:45:21.721 --> 00:45:23.820
<v Speaker 5>and then they try to work around it and </v>
<v Speaker 5>they wanted to Rehab,</v>

1056
00:45:23.821 --> 00:45:25.830
<v Speaker 5>aggravating it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then it gets worse and worse.</v>

1057
00:45:26.440 --> 00:45:28.750
<v Speaker 3>You were saying that a lot of times </v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll have,</v>

1058
00:45:29.710 --> 00:45:30.543
<v Speaker 3>you'll have like your disk will be </v>
<v Speaker 3>bulging a little bit or whatever these </v>

1059
00:45:33.821 --> 00:45:38.230
<v Speaker 3>little imperfections are and we all have</v>
<v Speaker 3>these imperfections in us,</v>

1060
00:45:38.830 --> 00:45:39.663
<v Speaker 3>but when you are stressed and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>muscles are tightening around you and </v>

1061
00:45:42.850 --> 00:45:43.683
<v Speaker 3>becoming inflamed because you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>carrying this stuff that you're not </v>

1062
00:45:46.331 --> 00:45:48.850
<v Speaker 3>working through,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything's constricting around it,</v>

1063
00:45:48.851 --> 00:45:52.090
<v Speaker 3>so then it's going to aggravate that and</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's going to become a bigger problem.</v>

1064
00:45:52.370 --> 00:45:55.760
<v Speaker 5>I definitely think that's true in some </v>
<v Speaker 5>cases,</v>

1065
00:45:56.360 --> 00:45:57.193
<v Speaker 5>but there's like there's legitimate,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like I had a conversation with a friend </v>

1066
00:45:59.121 --> 00:46:02.450
<v Speaker 5>of mine about this with the same sort of</v>
<v Speaker 5>a thing and I was like that.</v>

1067
00:46:02.690 --> 00:46:05.510
<v Speaker 5>That's all well and good,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I know people who are very light and</v>

1068
00:46:05.511 --> 00:46:09.260
<v Speaker 5>happy people who develop a legitimate </v>
<v Speaker 5>back issue and it has nothing to do with</v>

1069
00:46:09.261 --> 00:46:10.094
<v Speaker 5>stress that they're carrying around.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It has to do with the soft tissue that </v>

1070
00:46:13.401 --> 00:46:18.401
<v Speaker 5>protects your joints,</v>
<v Speaker 5>bulging out and contacting a nerve.</v>

1071
00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:20.273
<v Speaker 3>Look.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a zillion of us out there and </v>

1072
00:46:22.750 --> 00:46:24.660
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure there's all different issues </v>
<v Speaker 3>for it,</v>

1073
00:46:25.230 --> 00:46:26.063
<v Speaker 3>but back to your original question of </v>
<v Speaker 3>why am I thinking about simplifying and </v>

1074
00:46:28.561 --> 00:46:33.561
<v Speaker 3>all this kind of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am a pretty light positive person,</v>

1075
00:46:34.080 --> 00:46:35.370
<v Speaker 3>very optimistic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very.</v>

1076
00:46:35.371 --> 00:46:36.204
<v Speaker 3>I kind of live in that world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when I just started reading the </v>

1077
00:46:39.481 --> 00:46:39.901
<v Speaker 3>book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1078
00:46:39.901 --> 00:46:42.240
<v Speaker 3>are things really pissing me off?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Am I stressed?</v>

1079
00:46:42.300 --> 00:46:43.133
<v Speaker 3>Do I have anxiety because I live in this</v>
<v Speaker 3>house because I'm trying to do these </v>

1080
00:46:45.541 --> 00:46:46.374
<v Speaker 3>things with my career because I'm trying</v>
<v Speaker 3>to always do this because I'm carrying </v>

1081
00:46:49.860 --> 00:46:52.560
<v Speaker 3>children and parents and all of this </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>

1082
00:46:53.040 --> 00:46:54.990
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to make everybody happy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just,</v>

1083
00:46:55.110 --> 00:46:55.943
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe just realizing that and thinking </v>

1084
00:46:58.411 --> 00:47:01.110
<v Speaker 3>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm in no heavy meditation on it.</v>

1085
00:47:01.111 --> 00:47:03.690
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just being aware that maybe that's where</v>

1086
00:47:03.691 --> 00:47:04.524
<v Speaker 3>it's coming from.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm telling you over a month and a half </v>

1087
00:47:07.080 --> 00:47:10.950
<v Speaker 3>the pain slowly went away and I don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>have it.</v>

1088
00:47:11.310 --> 00:47:12.450
<v Speaker 3>Hm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1089
00:47:12.840 --> 00:47:15.570
<v Speaker 3>That is interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what,</v>

1090
00:47:16.650 --> 00:47:19.640
<v Speaker 5>what was bothering you before?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I know that you're,</v>

1091
00:47:19.820 --> 00:47:20.653
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're successful and you had a </v>

1092
00:47:21.841 --> 00:47:25.380
<v Speaker 5>television show for awhile and you've </v>
<v Speaker 5>got a bunch of projects going on.</v>

1093
00:47:25.381 --> 00:47:27.720
<v Speaker 5>You're always doing standup and </v>
<v Speaker 5>specials,</v>

1094
00:47:27.810 --> 00:47:28.643
<v Speaker 5>so you have had a lot of success.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You've got a lot of great stuff going </v>

1095
00:47:30.821 --> 00:47:31.960
<v Speaker 5>on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What was,</v>

1096
00:47:32.080 --> 00:47:33.880
<v Speaker 5>what was kind of chewing at you?</v>

1097
00:47:34.480 --> 00:47:35.313
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not really 100 percent sure of what </v>

1098
00:47:37.631 --> 00:47:38.464
<v Speaker 3>the sources,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I do feel like I have a lot of </v>

1099
00:47:43.361 --> 00:47:46.540
<v Speaker 3>people on my back and it's all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's all quiet.</v>

1100
00:47:46.570 --> 00:47:48.580
<v Speaker 3>It's all in my head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

1101
00:47:48.610 --> 00:47:50.260
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people on your back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1102
00:47:50.290 --> 00:47:51.950
<v Speaker 3>I've got a wife.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got,</v>

1103
00:47:52.360 --> 00:47:54.700
<v Speaker 3>I've got kids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got pets,</v>

1104
00:47:54.790 --> 00:47:57.040
<v Speaker 3>I've got family.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got</v>

1105
00:47:57.320 --> 00:48:00.360
<v Speaker 5>in the end that you feel that was a </v>
<v Speaker 5>weird,</v>

1106
00:48:00.361 --> 00:48:01.880
<v Speaker 5>a weird way to bring,</v>
<v Speaker 5>bring,</v>

1107
00:48:02.420 --> 00:48:04.100
<v Speaker 5>bring this up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but is that,</v>

1108
00:48:04.910 --> 00:48:07.520
<v Speaker 5>how much of that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like having a wife and having kids,</v>

1109
00:48:07.580 --> 00:48:08.413
<v Speaker 5>obviously there's going to be </v>
<v Speaker 5>compromises and there's going to be </v>

1110
00:48:11.691 --> 00:48:13.820
<v Speaker 5>stressed that comes along with any sort </v>
<v Speaker 5>of relationship,</v>

1111
00:48:14.570 --> 00:48:15.403
<v Speaker 5>but do you feel like it was tipping more</v>
<v Speaker 5>towards the negative than towards the </v>

1112
00:48:19.221 --> 00:48:20.054
<v Speaker 5>positive?</v>

1113
00:48:20.930 --> 00:48:22.920
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it was.</v>

1114
00:48:23.580 --> 00:48:25.080
<v Speaker 3>I think I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1115
00:48:25.650 --> 00:48:28.680
<v Speaker 3>the whole experience to me seems </v>
<v Speaker 3>positive.</v>

1116
00:48:29.640 --> 00:48:33.690
<v Speaker 3>My relationship with my wife is great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The kids I adore,</v>

1117
00:48:33.840 --> 00:48:38.840
<v Speaker 3>I feel like it's all positive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I do carry the burden of everybody's</v>

1118
00:48:39.091 --> 00:48:41.220
<v Speaker 3>worries and everybody's wellbeing all </v>
<v Speaker 3>the time.</v>

1119
00:48:41.221 --> 00:48:42.054
<v Speaker 3>I was working on this axis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this joke in my act before I started </v>

1120
00:48:44.071 --> 00:48:44.904
<v Speaker 3>thinking about all this stuff I had this</v>
<v Speaker 3>moment where I was standing in this </v>

1121
00:48:47.671 --> 00:48:49.320
<v Speaker 3>house.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I moved to this bigger house.</v>

1122
00:48:49.321 --> 00:48:50.154
<v Speaker 3>It's a really nice house to bigger,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bigger home and I was shutting off all </v>

1123
00:48:54.211 --> 00:48:55.044
<v Speaker 3>the lights is what I was working through</v>
<v Speaker 3>onstage and I was turning off all the </v>

1124
00:48:57.661 --> 00:48:58.494
<v Speaker 3>lights one night and locking the doors </v>
<v Speaker 3>for all the bad people that are coming </v>

1125
00:49:00.811 --> 00:49:01.644
<v Speaker 3>to get us and everyone's in their beds </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the cat's asleep and the dog's </v>

1126
00:49:04.321 --> 00:49:07.560
<v Speaker 3>asleep and everybody the lizard to sleep</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it just,</v>

1127
00:49:07.890 --> 00:49:10.170
<v Speaker 3>all my responsibility washed over me.</v>

1128
00:49:10.470 --> 00:49:15.360
<v Speaker 3>Like everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every living thing here is,</v>

1129
00:49:16.380 --> 00:49:17.040
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1130
00:49:17.040 --> 00:49:20.790
<v Speaker 3>depending on my success.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I don't keep going,</v>

1131
00:49:20.791 --> 00:49:21.624
<v Speaker 3>if I don't keep succeeding this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything here changes everybody's </v>

1132
00:49:25.501 --> 00:49:28.320
<v Speaker 3>little life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody's perfect little existence.</v>

1133
00:49:28.590 --> 00:49:32.490
<v Speaker 3>It's all washing over me and I can't </v>
<v Speaker 3>tell anyone about it.</v>

1134
00:49:32.520 --> 00:49:33.353
<v Speaker 3>I can tell you the audience,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I can't go sit on my daughter's bed </v>

1135
00:49:35.491 --> 00:49:37.070
<v Speaker 3>at two in the morning when I have that </v>
<v Speaker 3>feeling.</v>

1136
00:49:37.650 --> 00:49:38.483
<v Speaker 3>Honey temper.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you ever feel like he just can't do </v>

1137
00:49:41.131 --> 00:49:43.650
<v Speaker 3>it anymore?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You ever feel like he can't,</v>

1138
00:49:44.280 --> 00:49:47.040
<v Speaker 3>he just want to stop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He just wanted to take a break.</v>

1139
00:49:47.850 --> 00:49:50.190
<v Speaker 3>This whole thing about waking up my </v>
<v Speaker 3>daughter with my fears.</v>

1140
00:49:50.340 --> 00:49:52.860
<v Speaker 3>I can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't tell my wife that stuff.</v>

1141
00:49:52.861 --> 00:49:54.900
<v Speaker 3>I don't tell my kids that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just carry it.</v>

1142
00:49:55.350 --> 00:49:58.140
<v Speaker 3>So when I started reading this book I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1143
00:49:58.170 --> 00:50:02.040
<v Speaker 3>maybe I'm just taking all this really </v>
<v Speaker 3>seriously and feeling like</v>

1144
00:50:04.330 --> 00:50:06.640
<v Speaker 5>extended with the new home.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is that it?</v>

1145
00:50:06.660 --> 00:50:07.493
<v Speaker 5>Because a lot of times I have a friend </v>
<v Speaker 5>of mine who did that recently bought a </v>

1146
00:50:09.490 --> 00:50:13.330
<v Speaker 5>big place and he can afford it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but kind of.</v>

1147
00:50:13.470 --> 00:50:14.021
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1148
00:50:14.021 --> 00:50:14.854
<v Speaker 5>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

1149
00:50:15.970 --> 00:50:17.860
<v Speaker 5>think about this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now I'm a.</v>

1150
00:50:17.950 --> 00:50:18.783
<v Speaker 5>I'm a big advocate and never doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think you should ever buy a big </v>

1151
00:50:22.331 --> 00:50:23.620
<v Speaker 5>place unless you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

1152
00:50:23.621 --> 00:50:25.600
<v Speaker 5>we can get a nice place now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not even think about it.</v>

1153
00:50:25.650 --> 00:50:26.311
<v Speaker 3>Let's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1154
00:50:26.311 --> 00:50:27.950
<v Speaker 3>we're totally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can do it.</v>

1155
00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:28.933
<v Speaker 3>And it seemed to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hadn't really small place for a long </v>

1156
00:50:30.591 --> 00:50:32.690
<v Speaker 3>time and did all the right things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's.</v>

1157
00:50:33.530 --> 00:50:36.260
<v Speaker 3>The outlay is no different from my </v>
<v Speaker 3>little place before.</v>

1158
00:50:36.770 --> 00:50:37.603
<v Speaker 3>It's all cool,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when you walk into a place like </v>

1159
00:50:40.131 --> 00:50:41.930
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just feels bigger.</v>

1160
00:50:42.170 --> 00:50:44.420
<v Speaker 3>It just ain't no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The first time I bought a home ever,</v>

1161
00:50:44.421 --> 00:50:46.970
<v Speaker 3>I had this little place in studio city.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a little,</v>

1162
00:50:47.030 --> 00:50:47.801
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

1163
00:50:47.801 --> 00:50:51.380
<v Speaker 3>I remember laying on the couch like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hi,</v>

1164
00:50:51.381 --> 00:50:52.214
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if I can do this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got to sign this paper and every </v>

1165
00:50:55.810 --> 00:50:56.643
<v Speaker 3>say years is a long back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and every time the mail came for the </v>

1166
00:50:59.061 --> 00:51:01.730
<v Speaker 3>first year that I owned a home,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought it was going to be noticing.</v>

1167
00:51:01.731 --> 00:51:03.980
<v Speaker 3>You've got to get out of there now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you know what I mean.</v>

1168
00:51:04.340 --> 00:51:07.280
<v Speaker 3>I just was fearful about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mortgages are weird,</v>

1169
00:51:07.281 --> 00:51:08.270
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like you.</v>

1170
00:51:08.300 --> 00:51:10.850
<v Speaker 3>Here's a bill for 30 years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1171
00:51:11.090 --> 00:51:12.020
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's heavy.</v>

1172
00:51:12.021 --> 00:51:13.250
<v Speaker 3>That weighs on you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1173
00:51:13.700 --> 00:51:17.390
<v Speaker 3>So that's what it just brought me to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>feeling of like,</v>

1174
00:51:17.420 --> 00:51:18.253
<v Speaker 3>well maybe just going back and living </v>
<v Speaker 3>with my wife in that little studio </v>

1175
00:51:22.431 --> 00:51:25.100
<v Speaker 3>apartment in New York again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't be so bad.</v>

1176
00:51:25.130 --> 00:51:26.510
<v Speaker 3>Kid's a freak out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It would be.</v>

1177
00:51:26.640 --> 00:51:29.490
<v Speaker 3>The kids would free kids would hate it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The kids would have to be gone,</v>

1178
00:51:30.800 --> 00:51:32.300
<v Speaker 3>dad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you need to be more successful.</v>

1179
00:51:34.490 --> 00:51:37.760
<v Speaker 3>Take your pressure like a man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What'd you downsize?</v>

1180
00:51:37.970 --> 00:51:40.100
<v Speaker 3>Who cares if your next crooked of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>bitch?</v>

1181
00:51:40.101 --> 00:51:43.400
<v Speaker 3>Who cares if your arms go numb?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to go to Berkeley.</v>

1182
00:51:43.500 --> 00:51:46.580
<v Speaker 3>Everything's clean your teeth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I don't know.</v>

1183
00:51:46.581 --> 00:51:51.350
<v Speaker 3>I mean because it's a little self-aware </v>
<v Speaker 3>moment because I do,</v>

1184
00:51:51.380 --> 00:51:52.213
<v Speaker 3>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm.</v>

1185
00:51:52.760 --> 00:51:57.050
<v Speaker 3>I feel like I'm pretty carefree,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but why the hell am was my neck so</v>

1186
00:51:57.670 --> 00:51:59.470
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think in stuff that was something that</v>

1187
00:51:59.471 --> 00:52:00.304
<v Speaker 5>resonated with Sarano,</v>
<v Speaker 5>his book and I remember a Howard stern </v>

1188
00:52:02.171 --> 00:52:03.210
<v Speaker 5>talking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1189
00:52:03.290 --> 00:52:07.510
<v Speaker 5>he had a similar situation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I definitely think people carry a lot of</v>

1190
00:52:07.511 --> 00:52:11.950
<v Speaker 5>tension and then that tension sort of </v>
<v Speaker 5>manifested itself in physical pain,</v>

1191
00:52:12.340 --> 00:52:13.173
<v Speaker 5>but what I do is I do difficult things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I like to do difficult things that are </v>

1192
00:52:18.011 --> 00:52:18.844
<v Speaker 5>way more difficult than comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So if I'm doing Jujitsu or from </v>

1193
00:52:21.950 --> 00:52:25.270
<v Speaker 5>bowhunting for some of the workouts that</v>
<v Speaker 5>I do,</v>

1194
00:52:25.300 --> 00:52:30.300
<v Speaker 5>there's so much harder than,</v>
<v Speaker 5>than anything like out just yoga class.</v>

1195
00:52:31.120 --> 00:52:35.050
<v Speaker 5>Just a fucking 90 minute beak from Yoga </v>
<v Speaker 5>class in 140 degrees.</v>

1196
00:52:35.350 --> 00:52:38.710
<v Speaker 5>When you're going 100 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I put 100 percent effort to every pose.</v>

1197
00:52:38.720 --> 00:52:43.150
<v Speaker 5>Like fucking pouring sweat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's difficult when you do that.</v>

1198
00:52:43.420 --> 00:52:45.100
<v Speaker 5>It seems to me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>at least in my,</v>

1199
00:52:45.190 --> 00:52:48.550
<v Speaker 5>with my fucked up brain,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that other stuff doesn't bother me.</v>

1200
00:52:48.770 --> 00:52:50.110
<v Speaker 3>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're fucked up brain.</v>

1201
00:52:50.270 --> 00:52:55.270
<v Speaker 3>I equate this anxiety to stopping yoga.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did yoga for,</v>

1202
00:52:57.320 --> 00:52:58.153
<v Speaker 3>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 3>eight years and I haven't done it in </v>

1203
00:52:59.661 --> 00:53:01.130
<v Speaker 3>three.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll get back in there,</v>

1204
00:53:01.131 --> 00:53:02.510
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm telling you,</v>

1205
00:53:02.511 --> 00:53:04.580
<v Speaker 3>I used to walk around like the biggest </v>
<v Speaker 3>advocate.</v>

1206
00:53:04.590 --> 00:53:05.660
<v Speaker 3>I'm like no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Once I started,</v>

1207
00:53:05.661 --> 00:53:07.100
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stress here,</v>

1208
00:53:07.101 --> 00:53:08.770
<v Speaker 3>no pain here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So everything.</v>

1209
00:53:08.780 --> 00:53:11.600
<v Speaker 3>But when you started giving those pains,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why didn't you just get back in?</v>

1210
00:53:12.080 --> 00:53:17.080
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you what do I have no idea?</v>

1211
00:53:17.571 --> 00:53:18.404
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what the real answer is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in my head it's the classes from </v>

1212
00:53:20.601 --> 00:53:21.434
<v Speaker 3>nine till 10:30</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's when I do my best writing </v>

1213
00:53:23.481 --> 00:53:25.590
<v Speaker 3>when the kids get out of the house and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>can write in the morning.</v>

1214
00:53:25.710 --> 00:53:26.200
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1215
00:53:26.200 --> 00:53:27.033
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was,</v>

1216
00:53:27.660 --> 00:53:30.510
<v Speaker 5>that was my,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's my lame ass excuse.</v>

1217
00:53:31.080 --> 00:53:32.880
<v Speaker 5>You just gotTa Force Yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1218
00:53:32.881 --> 00:53:35.310
<v Speaker 5>I forced myself just try and write some </v>
<v Speaker 5>other time.</v>

1219
00:53:35.890 --> 00:53:37.560
<v Speaker 5>You sit down and you don't sit down and </v>
<v Speaker 5>write,</v>

1220
00:53:37.561 --> 00:53:38.910
<v Speaker 5>write like you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah,</v>

1221
00:53:38.911 --> 00:53:39.690
<v Speaker 5>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You do?</v>

1222
00:53:39.690 --> 00:53:42.000
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I thought you were a stage guy.</v>

1223
00:53:42.070 --> 00:53:43.110
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

1224
00:53:43.111 --> 00:53:44.550
<v Speaker 5>I'm a stage guy too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1225
00:53:44.551 --> 00:53:47.220
<v Speaker 5>Well I'm A.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm a firm believer like martial arts,</v>

1226
00:53:47.280 --> 00:53:48.113
<v Speaker 5>I think that you need to do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think you like if you wanted to be a </v>

1227
00:53:50.911 --> 00:53:53.040
<v Speaker 5>mixed martial artist and he only wanted </v>
<v Speaker 5>to work on your skill,</v>

1228
00:53:53.070 --> 00:53:54.420
<v Speaker 5>I think you're doing yourself a </v>
<v Speaker 5>disservice.</v>

1229
00:53:54.421 --> 00:53:56.160
<v Speaker 5>I think you need to do strength and </v>
<v Speaker 5>conditioning as well.</v>

1230
00:53:56.730 --> 00:53:59.120
<v Speaker 5>I think you need to do drills as well.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Spar,</v>

1231
00:53:59.520 --> 00:54:00.353
<v Speaker 5>I think comedy is the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think writing on stage and I think </v>

1232
00:54:03.540 --> 00:54:06.570
<v Speaker 5>there's a bunch of aspects that have </v>
<v Speaker 5>over the last few years.</v>

1233
00:54:06.930 --> 00:54:10.050
<v Speaker 5>I like to think that I've kind of got my</v>
<v Speaker 5>own way of doing it.</v>

1234
00:54:10.051 --> 00:54:10.884
<v Speaker 5>Everybody's got a different way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Obviously everyone's got a different </v>

1235
00:54:12.541 --> 00:54:15.480
<v Speaker 5>style.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My own way though is a bunch of things.</v>

1236
00:54:15.720 --> 00:54:17.400
<v Speaker 5>One,</v>
<v Speaker 5>socialization.</v>

1237
00:54:17.600 --> 00:54:18.860
<v Speaker 5>I need to socialize.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1238
00:54:18.900 --> 00:54:19.733
<v Speaker 5>I need to go out with friends.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I need to go have a drink or smoke some </v>

1239
00:54:22.471 --> 00:54:25.950
<v Speaker 5>pot with my buddies and we start </v>
<v Speaker 5>laughing and goofing around about things</v>

1240
00:54:25.970 --> 00:54:26.803
<v Speaker 5>or meet new people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Talk to some interesting person like </v>

1241
00:54:29.521 --> 00:54:30.354
<v Speaker 5>this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One of the things that I really like </v>

1242
00:54:30.601 --> 00:54:33.120
<v Speaker 5>about podcasts is to get to talk to </v>
<v Speaker 5>interesting,</v>

1243
00:54:33.121 --> 00:54:33.954
<v Speaker 5>cool people that kind of socializing </v>
<v Speaker 5>leads to new pathways of ideas get </v>

1244
00:54:38.731 --> 00:54:40.590
<v Speaker 5>expanded.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What made you think,</v>

1245
00:54:40.591 --> 00:54:41.980
<v Speaker 5>did you think of that are just </v>
<v Speaker 5>happening?</v>

1246
00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:45.510
<v Speaker 5>You look back like I remember thinking </v>
<v Speaker 5>somewhere along the line,</v>

1247
00:54:45.540 --> 00:54:46.373
<v Speaker 5>God,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I come up with a lot of great ideas for </v>

1248
00:54:47.461 --> 00:54:48.294
<v Speaker 5>bits when I'm having fun with people </v>
<v Speaker 5>having fun with friends or even with </v>

1249
00:54:51.901 --> 00:54:53.370
<v Speaker 5>people I don't even know if they're </v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

1250
00:54:53.710 --> 00:54:56.160
<v Speaker 5>you know the occasionally you'll meet </v>
<v Speaker 5>someone that's really cool,</v>

1251
00:54:56.220 --> 00:54:59.490
<v Speaker 5>you enjoy talking to them and then you </v>
<v Speaker 5>have these cool conversations.</v>

1252
00:54:59.490 --> 00:55:00.323
<v Speaker 5>You see this perspective from a stranger</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's interesting and they say </v>

1253
00:55:03.151 --> 00:55:05.910
<v Speaker 5>something and then it fires something in</v>
<v Speaker 5>your own brain.</v>

1254
00:55:06.210 --> 00:55:10.290
<v Speaker 5>I think socializing is big and I think </v>
<v Speaker 5>that's one of the reasons why really,</v>

1255
00:55:10.291 --> 00:55:11.124
<v Speaker 5>really famous comedians hit a dead spot </v>
<v Speaker 5>later in their career because they're </v>

1256
00:55:15.930 --> 00:55:20.500
<v Speaker 5>circle becomes very small because they </v>
<v Speaker 5>only trust certain people and they.</v>

1257
00:55:20.730 --> 00:55:21.563
<v Speaker 5>They kind of get anxiety about hanging </v>
<v Speaker 5>out with regular folks and just going </v>

1258
00:55:25.320 --> 00:55:25.981
<v Speaker 5>out there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1259
00:55:25.981 --> 00:55:28.350
<v Speaker 5>they get isolated.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They drive limos everywhere.</v>

1260
00:55:28.351 --> 00:55:30.510
<v Speaker 5>They live in a mansion and they never </v>
<v Speaker 5>get to meet anybody.</v>

1261
00:55:30.530 --> 00:55:33.240
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so socialization is big.</v>

1262
00:55:33.410 --> 00:55:36.120
<v Speaker 5>Activity is big.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I need to do things you need to do.</v>

1263
00:55:36.480 --> 00:55:38.310
<v Speaker 5>I need to go places.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I need to see things.</v>

1264
00:55:38.311 --> 00:55:39.990
<v Speaker 5>I need to travel,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I need to.</v>

1265
00:55:39.991 --> 00:55:42.930
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I do a lot of different things.</v>

1266
00:55:42.960 --> 00:55:45.450
<v Speaker 5>I like to try to get as much activity as</v>
<v Speaker 5>possible,</v>

1267
00:55:45.990 --> 00:55:49.200
<v Speaker 5>but physical writing to me is a must.</v>

1268
00:55:49.500 --> 00:55:51.720
<v Speaker 5>I sit down in front of my computer and I</v>
<v Speaker 5>write.</v>

1269
00:55:51.840 --> 00:55:54.930
<v Speaker 5>I write all the time and I don't </v>
<v Speaker 5>necessarily write jokes.</v>

1270
00:55:54.931 --> 00:55:56.040
<v Speaker 5>I just write,</v>
<v Speaker 5>write,</v>

1271
00:55:56.860 --> 00:56:00.240
<v Speaker 5>and then the jokes come out of that </v>
<v Speaker 5>premise has come out of that stuff.</v>

1272
00:56:00.300 --> 00:56:02.610
<v Speaker 5>I'm more essays.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I love that.</v>

1273
00:56:02.760 --> 00:56:03.593
<v Speaker 5>That's one of my favorite parts of </v>
<v Speaker 5>standup is just being by myself and </v>

1274
00:56:06.511 --> 00:56:08.190
<v Speaker 5>writing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just that part,</v>

1275
00:56:08.191 --> 00:56:10.550
<v Speaker 5>that mining,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1276
00:56:10.590 --> 00:56:12.060
<v Speaker 5>you're just mining.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>

1277
00:56:12.061 --> 00:56:14.460
<v Speaker 5>And then once in awhile you get this </v>
<v Speaker 5>great stuff that comes out.</v>

1278
00:56:14.461 --> 00:56:15.294
<v Speaker 5>A lot of times nothing comes out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the biggest challenge of writing </v>

1279
00:56:17.071 --> 00:56:21.120
<v Speaker 5>is getting out of your way and not </v>
<v Speaker 5>beating yourself up.</v>

1280
00:56:21.121 --> 00:56:22.850
<v Speaker 5>If everything that comes out isn't </v>
<v Speaker 5>great.</v>

1281
00:56:22.980 --> 00:56:24.100
<v Speaker 5>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Most of it isn't</v>

1282
00:56:24.100 --> 00:56:26.110
<v Speaker 4>great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think one of the biggest challenges of</v>

1283
00:56:26.111 --> 00:56:26.944
<v Speaker 4>writing is discipline.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's one of the biggest challenges </v>

1284
00:56:29.081 --> 00:56:29.914
<v Speaker 4>because most people just don't know if </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're a writer of your comic and </v>

1285
00:56:33.581 --> 00:56:34.414
<v Speaker 4>someone does no one telling you you have</v>
<v Speaker 4>to do it because you have this open </v>

1286
00:56:38.811 --> 00:56:41.230
<v Speaker 4>ended schedule.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you could have gone to yoga.</v>

1287
00:56:41.320 --> 00:56:42.610
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>From nine to 10:30</v>

1288
00:56:42.611 --> 00:56:43.444
<v Speaker 4>and he chose to write like you and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>might have chosen to write because yoga </v>

1289
00:56:46.151 --> 00:56:47.520
<v Speaker 4>is too hard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You might've decided,</v>

1290
00:56:47.600 --> 00:56:49.510
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>writing is too difficult.</v>

1291
00:56:49.511 --> 00:56:51.730
<v Speaker 4>I'm just going to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or Yoga is too difficult.</v>

1292
00:56:51.731 --> 00:56:52.420
<v Speaker 4>I'm just kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1293
00:56:52.420 --> 00:56:54.370
<v Speaker 4>I mean it could be one of one of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1294
00:56:54.520 --> 00:56:57.400
<v Speaker 4>either reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1295
00:56:57.430 --> 00:56:59.360
<v Speaker 4>it's a no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

1296
00:56:59.440 --> 00:57:00.790
<v Speaker 4>I should do both.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I should.</v>

1297
00:57:01.360 --> 00:57:02.300
<v Speaker 4>You said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1298
00:57:02.370 --> 00:57:04.930
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I always try with writing also to not be</v>

1299
00:57:04.931 --> 00:57:05.764
<v Speaker 4>so rigid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like there was a time when I could only </v>

1300
00:57:08.441 --> 00:57:09.274
<v Speaker 4>write on the computer in the morning up </v>
<v Speaker 4>until 10 and it's like that's stupid </v>

1301
00:57:14.970 --> 00:57:16.570
<v Speaker 4>because sometimes I don't have my </v>
<v Speaker 4>computer.</v>

1302
00:57:16.570 --> 00:57:21.570
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes I just have a pad and I'm in a</v>
<v Speaker 4>coffee house after doing radio at 11,</v>

1303
00:57:21.940 --> 00:57:22.773
<v Speaker 4>so why not do that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So my thing now is I just make myself </v>

1304
00:57:25.961 --> 00:57:29.470
<v Speaker 4>sit down for two hours at some point,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>

1305
00:57:29.830 --> 00:57:31.040
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't matter if it's late in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>day,</v>

1306
00:57:31.090 --> 00:57:32.020
<v Speaker 4>night,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever it is.</v>

1307
00:57:32.740 --> 00:57:35.170
<v Speaker 4>That's like your workout.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like you've got to sit.</v>

1308
00:57:35.200 --> 00:57:37.060
<v Speaker 4>Just sit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you ever read on your phone?</v>

1309
00:57:37.420 --> 00:57:38.253
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what's amazing about riding on </v>

1310
00:57:39.461 --> 00:57:41.980
<v Speaker 4>the phone?</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you have an iphone or even.</v>

1311
00:57:41.981 --> 00:57:44.320
<v Speaker 4>There's actually a lot of them now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Use notes.</v>

1312
00:57:44.350 --> 00:57:46.150
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Notes and um,</v>

1313
00:57:46.320 --> 00:57:48.970
<v Speaker 4>and then dictated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

1314
00:57:49.090 --> 00:57:50.950
<v Speaker 4>Is it accurate?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Super accurate.</v>

1315
00:57:50.980 --> 00:57:51.671
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 4>It's not perfect.</v>

1333
00:58:28.801 --> 00:58:30.060
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's pretty good.</v>

1334
00:58:30.090 --> 00:58:31.810
<v Speaker 4>Meanwhile,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Hey.</v>

00:58:32.820 --> 00:58:34.030
<v Speaker 4>that's a pretty bad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Was worse.</v>

1337
00:58:34.110 --> 00:58:35.460
<v Speaker 4>It keeps.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It keeps dictating.</v>

1338
00:58:35.640 --> 00:58:37.290
<v Speaker 4>It still talking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's getting this whole.</v>

1339
00:58:37.680 --> 00:58:40.950
<v Speaker 4>It just said what the fuck is hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you do that when you're driving?</v>

1340
00:58:41.250 --> 00:58:43.170
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's how I do text if I have to.</v>

1341
00:58:43.171 --> 00:58:44.880
<v Speaker 4>If I'm driving.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I try not to do that though.</v>

1342
00:58:45.150 --> 00:58:45.983
<v Speaker 4>What I do when I'm driving,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is a big one for me is I've turned </v>

1343
00:58:48.091 --> 00:58:50.940
<v Speaker 4>the phone upside down and I put it over </v>
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>

1344
00:58:51.150 --> 00:58:52.740
<v Speaker 4>I don't have a near me when you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>driving.</v>

1345
00:58:53.130 --> 00:58:53.963
<v Speaker 4>It's too creepy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like too many people are fucking </v>

1346
00:58:55.861 --> 00:58:58.200
<v Speaker 4>driving and not paying attention and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they crash into each other.</v>

1347
00:58:58.201 --> 00:59:00.270
<v Speaker 4>I know it's the worst.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's way too common.</v>

1348
00:59:00.300 --> 00:59:02.280
<v Speaker 4>So bad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I fucking.</v>

1349
00:59:02.370 --> 00:59:05.850
<v Speaker 4>Every time I'm on the road and I see </v>
<v Speaker 4>someone weaving in and out of traffic,</v>

1350
00:59:06.030 --> 00:59:06.863
<v Speaker 4>I see the light of their phones in their</v>
<v Speaker 4>eyes and they try to text while they're </v>

1351
00:59:09.901 --> 00:59:11.310
<v Speaker 4>driving.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so dangerous.</v>

1352
00:59:11.400 --> 00:59:12.450
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>

1353
00:59:12.870 --> 00:59:15.840
<v Speaker 4>My daughter is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My oldest one is 14,</v>

1354
00:59:15.841 --> 00:59:18.690
<v Speaker 4>which means she can get a permit next </v>
<v Speaker 4>year,</v>

1355
00:59:19.100 --> 00:59:21.290
<v Speaker 4>like 15 and a half that she text.</v>

1356
00:59:22.190 --> 00:59:24.200
<v Speaker 5>She's not crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She's,</v>

1357
00:59:24.201 --> 00:59:25.034
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she's like a normal kid but she's not </v>

1358
00:59:26.551 --> 00:59:29.030
<v Speaker 5>like really obsessed with it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I just,</v>

1359
00:59:29.031 --> 00:59:31.790
<v Speaker 5>it scares the hell out of me once they </v>
<v Speaker 5>start getting one little chips.</v>

1360
00:59:31.970 --> 00:59:34.910
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One nuts when things get so yes.</v>

1361
00:59:34.940 --> 00:59:35.773
<v Speaker 5>So crazy fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Although the energy involved in </v>

1362
00:59:39.741 --> 00:59:42.350
<v Speaker 5>relationships for young kids,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you might get on kid.</v>

1363
00:59:42.351 --> 00:59:47.210
<v Speaker 5>They go from being 11 where hopefully </v>
<v Speaker 5>there's no fucking at all.</v>

1364
00:59:47.360 --> 00:59:48.193
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Two 15 where that's all you're thinking </v>

1365

<v Speaker 5>of.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 5>40 something months</v>

1367
00:59:54.440 --> 00:59:57.320
<v Speaker 1>and then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he doesn't call.</v>

1368
00:59:57.321 --> 00:59:58.154
<v Speaker 1>You are likely aware there's a problem </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're waiting and you're checking </v>

1369
01:00:00.411 --> 01:00:01.244
<v Speaker 1>your phone every two seconds to see the </v>
<v Speaker 1>response and now you're driving to go </v>

1370
01:00:05.271 --> 01:00:10.271
<v Speaker 1>pick up milk for your mom and you hear a</v>
<v Speaker 1>ding and you reach over to check it.</v>

1371
01:00:10.370 --> 01:00:11.240
<v Speaker 1>Boom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hit a tree.</v>

1372
01:00:11.300 --> 01:00:12.770
<v Speaker 1>I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1373
01:00:12.980 --> 01:00:14.820
<v Speaker 1>My neck just started hurting again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1374
01:00:14.900 --> 01:00:17.630
<v Speaker 1>the arms now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Massive,</v>

1375
01:00:18.080 --> 01:00:21.650
<v Speaker 1>massive fucking hormones raging through </v>
<v Speaker 1>your body,</v>

1376
01:00:21.651 --> 01:00:24.470
<v Speaker 1>telling you to get pregnant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>telling you to get someone pregnant.</v>

1377
01:00:24.740 --> 01:00:27.140
<v Speaker 1>Could you imagine if we had phones when </v>
<v Speaker 1>we were going through puberty?</v>

1378
01:00:27.170 --> 01:00:29.810
<v Speaker 1>Could you imagine all the Dick Pics that</v>

1380
01:00:30.860 --> 01:00:31.693

<v Speaker 1>the begging of girls to show me </v>

1381
01:00:33.561 --> 01:00:37.800
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do something please.</v>

1382
01:00:37.820 --> 01:00:40.610

1383
01:00:40.780 --> 01:00:43.910
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but on the other hand,</v>

1384
01:00:43.911 --> 01:00:45.740
<v Speaker 1>you'd be wiser.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1385
01:00:45.770 --> 01:00:47.810
<v Speaker 1>because you'd be able to google things.</v>

01:00:47.811 --> 01:00:50.120
<v Speaker 1>how many bullshitters did we know </v>
<v Speaker 1>growing up?</v>

1387
01:00:50.121 --> 01:00:53.540
<v Speaker 1>It just would lie and make stories up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

1388
01:00:53.541 --> 01:00:55.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those people were out of business,</v>

1389
01:00:57.090 --> 01:00:57.923
<v Speaker 5>but not necessarily.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Have you been paying attention to fake </v>

<v Speaker 5>which by the way,</v>

1394
01:01:09.181 --> 01:01:10.014
<v Speaker 5>it's a very controversial,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what's fake and what's not fake about </v>

1395
01:01:12.331 --> 01:01:15.810
<v Speaker 5>pizza gate because pizza gate is </v>
<v Speaker 5>connected to that.</v>

1396
01:01:15.811 --> 01:01:16.644
<v Speaker 5>John Podesta Guy who is a very </v>
<v Speaker 5>controversial character who still </v>

1397
01:01:21.301 --> 01:01:22.134
<v Speaker 5>friends with that Dennis Hastert Guy who</v>
<v Speaker 5>was the speaker of the house who's </v>

1398
01:01:26.010 --> 01:01:28.380
<v Speaker 5>absolutely a pedophile.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1399
01:01:28.500 --> 01:01:32.340
<v Speaker 5>absolutely.</v>

1400
01:01:32.700 --> 01:01:34.140
<v Speaker 5>admitted,</v>
<v Speaker 5>admitted.</v>

1401
01:01:34.170 --> 01:01:36.840
<v Speaker 5>So the fact that that guy is friends </v>
<v Speaker 5>with that.</v>

1402
01:01:36.841 --> 01:01:37.674
<v Speaker 5>And then also Andrew Breitbart </v>
<v Speaker 5>apparently in 2011 was made a tweet </v>

1403
01:01:43.890 --> 01:01:48.890
<v Speaker 5>about Podesta being a guy who helps </v>
<v Speaker 5>people who fuck kids.</v>

1404
01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:53.970
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it was like he made this crazy tweet</v>

1405
01:01:53.971 --> 01:01:54.804
<v Speaker 5>about him in 2011,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which five years later after Breitbart </v>

1406
01:01:57.901 --> 01:01:59.180
<v Speaker 5>is dead.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a.</v>

1407
01:01:59.181 --> 01:02:01.350
<v Speaker 5>it's a very interesting to read that </v>
<v Speaker 5>tweet and say,</v>

1408
01:02:01.351 --> 01:02:02.184
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what did he know about Podesta before </v>

1409
01:02:03.780 --> 01:02:04.613
<v Speaker 5>all this spirit cooking and all this </v>
<v Speaker 5>craziness came out with the Hillary </v>

1410
01:02:08.281 --> 01:02:09.114
<v Speaker 5>campaign.</v>

1411
01:02:09.930 --> 01:02:12.090

<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

01:02:14.671 --> 01:02:15.121
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>pull up,</v>

1414
01:02:15.121 --> 01:02:17.310
<v Speaker 5>pull up the tweet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is from 2011.</v>

1415
01:02:17.610 --> 01:02:19.380
<v Speaker 5>How Prague,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Prague,</v>

1416
01:02:19.381 --> 01:02:20.214
<v Speaker 5>like Progressive Guru John Podesta isn't</v>
<v Speaker 5>household name as world class underage </v>

1417
01:02:24.771 --> 01:02:26.790
<v Speaker 5>sex,</v>
<v Speaker 5>slave op cover,</v>

1418
01:02:26.791 --> 01:02:30.720
<v Speaker 5>upper defending,</v>
<v Speaker 5>unspeakable dregs escapes me.</v>

1419
01:02:30.900 --> 01:02:31.733
<v Speaker 5>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This was of course when hastert was </v>

1420
01:02:34.230 --> 01:02:35.063
<v Speaker 5>about to get convicted,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so he's been friends with hastert </v>

1421
01:02:38.310 --> 01:02:40.170
<v Speaker 5>forever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Has stirred by the way,</v>

1422
01:02:40.380 --> 01:02:45.380
<v Speaker 5>was the fucking speaker of the house and</v>
<v Speaker 5>he had been fucking kids for years.</v>

1423
01:02:47.610 --> 01:02:48.443
<v Speaker 5>So anybody who doesn't think that it can</v>
<v Speaker 5>reach you could be a pedophile and </v>

1424
01:02:51.451 --> 01:02:53.520
<v Speaker 5>covered up and reach high levels of </v>
<v Speaker 5>government.</v>

1425
01:02:53.760 --> 01:02:54.593
<v Speaker 5>You are mistaken.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it is possible Penn State football </v>

1426
01:02:56.911 --> 01:02:58.050
<v Speaker 5>program.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>

1427
01:02:58.410 --> 01:03:00.740

<v Speaker 5>but yeah.</v>

1430
01:03:05.850 --> 01:03:09.210
<v Speaker 5>would work with young kids and take them</v>
<v Speaker 5>on the road and fuck them.</v>

1431
01:03:09.890 --> 01:03:10.820
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1442
01:03:48.600 --> 01:03:51.730

<v Speaker 5>he was convinced that their,</v>

1443
01:03:51.731 --> 01:03:52.940
<v Speaker 5>their fucking kids in this school.</v>

1444
01:03:53.220 --> 01:03:55.650
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's the thing with the fake news,</v>

1445
01:03:56.100 --> 01:03:57.710
<v Speaker 3>I had this discussion with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1446
01:03:58.020 --> 01:04:01.080
<v Speaker 3>with my daughter actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and um,</v>

1447
01:04:01.430 --> 01:04:02.263
<v Speaker 3>we were talking about like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how are we just entering an era where </v>

1448
01:04:04.201 --> 01:04:07.860
<v Speaker 3>you're never going to know what's real </v>
<v Speaker 3>and what's not like thing is going to be</v>

1449
01:04:07.861 --> 01:04:11.460
<v Speaker 3>so sophisticated on both sides that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're never gonna be able to Parse it.</v>

1450
01:04:12.060 --> 01:04:14.580
<v Speaker 3>And she had a great point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She said,</v>

1451
01:04:14.581 --> 01:04:15.414
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when we do papers at school and my wife </v>

1452
01:04:17.581 --> 01:04:20.700
<v Speaker 3>who's in college now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1453
01:04:21.540 --> 01:04:26.400
<v Speaker 3>when they do papers for school,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have to because of the Internet,</v>

1454
01:04:26.401 --> 01:04:28.260
<v Speaker 3>because there's so much stuff you have </v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

1455
01:04:28.570 --> 01:04:29.403
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>provide the sources for where your </v>

1456
01:04:31.891 --> 01:04:34.530
<v Speaker 3>information is coming from.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you're writing these papers,</v>

1457
01:04:34.860 --> 01:04:38.610
<v Speaker 3>you have to have a legitimate source </v>
<v Speaker 3>attached to any of the facts that you're</v>

1458
01:04:38.611 --> 01:04:41.580
<v Speaker 3>putting in there so that they know that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you did the research and stuff.</v>

1459
01:04:41.581 --> 01:04:45.410
<v Speaker 3>And there's point being there's like </v>
<v Speaker 3>real.</v>

1460
01:04:45.450 --> 01:04:46.283
<v Speaker 3>There will always be really legitimate </v>
<v Speaker 3>news sources where you can cite that </v>

1461
01:04:49.620 --> 01:04:53.070
<v Speaker 3>people agree that this is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

1462
01:04:53.120 --> 01:04:57.330
<v Speaker 3>a place where it's been filtered or not </v>
<v Speaker 3>filtered,</v>

1463
01:04:57.331 --> 01:05:02.331
<v Speaker 3>but it comes from a newsworthy source.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't just spew stuff and just put,</v>

1464
01:05:02.461 --> 01:05:06.600
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>such and such website and have that pass</v>

1465
01:05:06.900 --> 01:05:09.420
<v Speaker 3>in an in an academic setting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1466
01:05:09.450 --> 01:05:10.283
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there is that little way of </v>

1467
01:05:13.350 --> 01:05:16.620
<v Speaker 3>parsing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The truth will probably end up being the</v>

1468
01:05:16.621 --> 01:05:17.890
<v Speaker 3>way that we all parsed the truth.</v>

1469
01:05:18.310 --> 01:05:23.310
<v Speaker 5>I agree with you to a certain extent.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that like legitimate studies and</v>

1470
01:05:23.680 --> 01:05:24.513
<v Speaker 5>things that were done by legitimate </v>
<v Speaker 5>researchers where they have peer </v>

1471
01:05:27.851 --> 01:05:30.160
<v Speaker 5>reviewed studies and everything's been </v>
<v Speaker 5>vetted out,</v>

1472
01:05:30.550 --> 01:05:35.550
<v Speaker 5>but news sources are so suspect now what</v>
<v Speaker 5>we saw from this past election,</v>

1473
01:05:37.510 --> 01:05:40.990
<v Speaker 5>whether you support trump or whether you</v>
<v Speaker 5>support hillary sport,</v>

1474
01:05:40.991 --> 01:05:41.824
<v Speaker 5>anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What I saw from this election is very </v>

1475
01:05:45.941 --> 01:05:50.170
<v Speaker 5>little unbiased truth.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What I saw was a lot of,</v>

1476
01:05:50.500 --> 01:05:54.560
<v Speaker 5>whether it's pro hillary or anti hillary</v>
<v Speaker 5>pro trump or anti-trump,</v>

1477
01:05:54.580 --> 01:05:58.480
<v Speaker 5>I sound a lot of editorial influence.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1478
01:05:58.720 --> 01:06:02.230
<v Speaker 5>and you saw that on television.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You saw that in the New York Times.</v>

1479
01:06:02.231 --> 01:06:03.820
<v Speaker 5>You saw them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Washington Post's.</v>

1480
01:06:03.821 --> 01:06:04.654
<v Speaker 5>Do you saw that in what we would think </v>
<v Speaker 5>of as legitimate news sources without </v>

1481
01:06:08.591 --> 01:06:10.120
<v Speaker 5>bias?</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're not.</v>

1482
01:06:10.420 --> 01:06:12.220
<v Speaker 5>They're just not anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>

1483
01:06:12.221 --> 01:06:17.050
<v Speaker 5>there's some certain people that felt </v>
<v Speaker 5>like as a person with their own point of</v>

1484
01:06:17.051 --> 01:06:17.884
<v Speaker 5>view and perspective and thoughts on the</v>
<v Speaker 5>burden that one carries by having a </v>

1485
01:06:22.901 --> 01:06:23.734
<v Speaker 5>voice,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that it's imperative that they get out </v>

1486
01:06:25.600 --> 01:06:27.490
<v Speaker 5>what they believe about a certain </v>
<v Speaker 5>candidate.</v>

1487
01:06:27.490 --> 01:06:29.560
<v Speaker 5>Especially with trump.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It could be slanted,</v>

1488
01:06:29.561 --> 01:06:31.390
<v Speaker 5>but there's still,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's still is,</v>

1489
01:06:31.480 --> 01:06:34.660
<v Speaker 5>did this thing happen or not happen?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>

1490
01:06:34.720 --> 01:06:38.590
<v Speaker 5>Did your tax return really right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Was that information like,</v>

1491
01:06:38.730 --> 01:06:40.720
<v Speaker 5>did we all see it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>

1492
01:06:40.900 --> 01:06:41.733
<v Speaker 5>You can slant things and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fox can put those dangerous things </v>

1493
01:06:45.221 --> 01:06:46.054
<v Speaker 5>that's dangerous even that's dangerous </v>
<v Speaker 5>because you could take one aspect of it </v>

1494
01:06:49.180 --> 01:06:52.360
<v Speaker 5>and completely ride it into the ground </v>
<v Speaker 5>and make it look like,</v>

1495
01:06:52.361 --> 01:06:54.160
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>here's one thing they were.</v>

1496
01:06:54.180 --> 01:06:57.740
<v Speaker 5>They kept harping on about the all these</v>
<v Speaker 5>conspiracy theories,</v>

1497
01:06:57.760 --> 01:07:01.080
<v Speaker 5>theories about Hillary being ill </v>
<v Speaker 5>bullshit.</v>

1498
01:07:01.240 --> 01:07:04.540
<v Speaker 5>She falls asleep while she's standing up</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's ill,</v>

1499
01:07:04.930 --> 01:07:07.090
<v Speaker 5>she's not healthy like.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they would try to.</v>

1500
01:07:07.120 --> 01:07:07.953
<v Speaker 5>That was editorial influence on the fact</v>
<v Speaker 5>of her being an old lady who fell down </v>

1501
01:07:14.471 --> 01:07:18.100
<v Speaker 5>in 2012 and got brain damage,</v>
<v Speaker 5>cracked her head open.</v>

1502
01:07:18.310 --> 01:07:19.630
<v Speaker 5>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>literally,</v>

1503
01:07:19.750 --> 01:07:23.260
<v Speaker 5>according to Bill Clinton was </v>
<v Speaker 5>convalescing for six months.</v>

1504
01:07:23.590 --> 01:07:27.520
<v Speaker 5>This is his perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He said she was in real bad shape and it</v>

1505
01:07:27.521 --> 01:07:32.350
<v Speaker 5>took her six months to get out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was the wikileaks emails that show</v>

1506
01:07:32.351 --> 01:07:37.240
<v Speaker 5>that she had a seizure in 2015 during </v>
<v Speaker 5>the presidential campaign.</v>

1507
01:07:37.330 --> 01:07:38.163
<v Speaker 5>She's at that nine slash 11 memorial.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She passes out and all those six </v>

1508
01:07:42.700 --> 01:07:47.080
<v Speaker 5>security people scooping and catcher </v>
<v Speaker 5>because they were there quick like,</v>

1509
01:07:47.110 --> 01:07:49.120
<v Speaker 5>it's fucking happened before.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

1510
01:07:49.121 --> 01:07:51.370
<v Speaker 5>this is not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is not an unusual occurrence.</v>

1511
01:07:51.371 --> 01:07:52.204
<v Speaker 5>I don't think.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think they did a real good job of </v>

1512
01:07:53.501 --> 01:07:55.840
<v Speaker 5>covering it up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there was so many media stories that</v>

1513
01:07:55.841 --> 01:07:56.674
<v Speaker 5>we're talking about the conspiracy </v>
<v Speaker 5>theory of her being ill or that there </v>

1514
01:08:00.011 --> 01:08:01.600
<v Speaker 5>was so much.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1515
01:08:01.690 --> 01:08:02.523
<v Speaker 5>so many people were latching on to her </v>
<v Speaker 5>health and obviously she showed in that </v>

1516
01:08:07.091 --> 01:08:08.350
<v Speaker 5>debate that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>or helped was fine.</v>

1517
01:08:08.470 --> 01:08:08.951
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>first of all,</v>

1518
01:08:08.951 --> 01:08:11.410
<v Speaker 5>she's on drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they put her on Modafinil.</v>

1519
01:08:11.470 --> 01:08:14.920
<v Speaker 5>That was another thing that was listed </v>
<v Speaker 5>in the wikileaks.</v>

1520
01:08:15.050 --> 01:08:16.430
<v Speaker 5>She's taking provigil,</v>

1521
01:08:16.520 --> 01:08:17.790
<v Speaker 4>she's taking this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1522
01:08:17.800 --> 01:08:20.480
<v Speaker 4>this stimulant that they give the </v>
<v Speaker 4>fighter pilots,</v>

1523
01:08:20.760 --> 01:08:21.593
<v Speaker 4>keep them from falling asleep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a drug for people that have </v>

1524
01:08:23.781 --> 01:08:25.640
<v Speaker 4>narcolepsy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like she's on this,</v>

1525
01:08:26.060 --> 01:08:26.601
<v Speaker 4>so like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1526
01:08:26.601 --> 01:08:29.190
<v Speaker 4>that's probably why she looks stimulated</v>
<v Speaker 4>and she's.</v>

1527
01:08:29.370 --> 01:08:32.360
<v Speaker 4>She's artificially propped up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so this is a.</v>

1528
01:08:32.810 --> 01:08:35.090
<v Speaker 4>This to me was a big sticking point.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like I'm not,</v>

1529
01:08:35.330 --> 01:08:36.163
<v Speaker 4>I'm not anti Hillary.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm anti a lot of the things she stands </v>

1530
01:08:39.861 --> 01:08:41.150
<v Speaker 4>for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm not pro trump.</v>

1531
01:08:41.750 --> 01:08:42.770
<v Speaker 4>I watched that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

1532
01:08:42.830 --> 01:08:44.120
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not being honest with me.</v>

1533
01:08:44.450 --> 01:08:46.340
<v Speaker 4>She's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not supposed to fall asleep while</v>

1534
01:08:46.341 --> 01:08:49.250
<v Speaker 4>you're standing up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you fall asleep while you're standing</v>

1535
01:08:49.251 --> 01:08:50.540
<v Speaker 4>up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a real problem.</v>

1536
01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:54.020
<v Speaker 4>You shouldn't be doing anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You should be in bed and find out what's</v>

1537
01:08:54.021 --> 01:08:55.250
<v Speaker 4>wrong with you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1538
01:08:55.490 --> 01:08:56.323
<v Speaker 4>you should.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You definitely shouldn't be running the </v>

1539
01:08:57.231 --> 01:08:59.870
<v Speaker 4>world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It just propping you up.</v>

1540
01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:03.410
<v Speaker 4>I really felt like every time you'd see </v>
<v Speaker 4>her walking out towards the podium,</v>

1541
01:09:03.830 --> 01:09:04.663
<v Speaker 4>that the biggest,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the biggest worry of hers was not </v>

1542
01:09:07.250 --> 01:09:08.083
<v Speaker 4>tipping over to just hear fall on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>jet when she got to the top stairs of </v>

1543
01:09:10.991 --> 01:09:14.510
<v Speaker 4>the jet and she tipped for the one </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking on camera.</v>

1544
01:09:14.570 --> 01:09:16.680
<v Speaker 4>Did you ever see that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I never saw watch.</v>

1545
01:09:17.030 --> 01:09:17.863
<v Speaker 4>Pull that video up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then why we can't walk and why was </v>

1546
01:09:19.790 --> 01:09:24.270
<v Speaker 4>she was a little bit of a cold.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The fucking guy was working on this.</v>

1547
01:09:24.950 --> 01:09:25.731
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it does.</v>

1548
01:09:25.731 --> 01:09:28.370
<v Speaker 4>Coke.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are you worried about sessions coming in</v>

1549
01:09:28.371 --> 01:09:30.410
<v Speaker 4>and ending all the fun?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look at it.</v>

1550
01:09:30.470 --> 01:09:33.050
<v Speaker 4>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she can't walk without holding onto that</v>

1551
01:09:33.051 --> 01:09:34.890
<v Speaker 4>railing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's clutching that thing.</v>

1552
01:09:35.030 --> 01:09:36.740
<v Speaker 4>It's hard for everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Shit.</v>

1553
01:09:36.741 --> 01:09:38.300
<v Speaker 4>She gets to the top.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's slowing down.</v>

1554
01:09:38.301 --> 01:09:40.310
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she's slowing down a lot of steps.</v>

1555
01:09:40.311 --> 01:09:42.020
<v Speaker 4>It's probably all light.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Haven't headed.</v>

1556
01:09:42.070 --> 01:09:43.010
<v Speaker 4>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here we go.</v>

1557
01:09:43.090 --> 01:09:44.940
<v Speaker 4>You're good to budget.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Good to do.</v>

1558
01:09:46.820 --> 01:09:48.900
<v Speaker 4>She can't walk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So funny to stop.</v>

1559
01:09:49.350 --> 01:09:51.290
<v Speaker 4>This is not good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>None of this is good.</v>

1560
01:09:51.730 --> 01:09:54.000
<v Speaker 4>Fall down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It happens the fuck out of here.</v>

1561
01:09:54.001 --> 01:09:56.690
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't fall like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I sometimes come across the stage at the</v>

1562
01:09:56.691 --> 01:09:57.440
<v Speaker 4>comedy store.</v>

1563
01:09:57.440 --> 01:10:00.080
<v Speaker 4>I have to make sure my foot's plan </v>
<v Speaker 4>turned around and I go like this.</v>

1564
01:10:01.700 --> 01:10:03.320
<v Speaker 4>I'm fine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's hard.</v>

1565
01:10:03.321 --> 01:10:04.670
<v Speaker 4>Walking around.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bullshit.</v>

1566
01:10:05.030 --> 01:10:07.160
<v Speaker 4>Get on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Was a lot of steps.</v>

1567
01:10:07.430 --> 01:10:09.080
<v Speaker 4>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was a lot of steps.</v>

1568
01:10:09.110 --> 01:10:12.620
<v Speaker 4>My mind couldn't run the free world </v>
<v Speaker 4>while your mom shouldn't be president.</v>

1569
01:10:12.640 --> 01:10:15.140
<v Speaker 4>She's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's like Hillary's age.</v>

1570
01:10:15.780 --> 01:10:18.870
<v Speaker 4>She shouldn't be president.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think physical health,</v>

1571
01:10:18.871 --> 01:10:19.704
<v Speaker 4>this is something that you should take </v>
<v Speaker 4>into consideration when you have an </v>

1572
01:10:21.560 --> 01:10:24.440
<v Speaker 4>unbelievably stressful job that looks </v>
<v Speaker 4>like it drains you,</v>

1573
01:10:24.441 --> 01:10:25.274
<v Speaker 4>like a vampire sucking on your neck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't believe both of them were </v>

1574
01:10:27.590 --> 01:10:29.630
<v Speaker 4>still standing at the end.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it was.</v>

1575
01:10:29.631 --> 01:10:33.530
<v Speaker 4>So when you think about the travel and </v>
<v Speaker 4>the speeches and the pressure groups,</v>

1576
01:10:33.590 --> 01:10:34.423
<v Speaker 4>both of them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean really that was that they were </v>

1577
01:10:36.610 --> 01:10:37.650
<v Speaker 4>buying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1578
01:10:37.790 --> 01:10:39.020
<v Speaker 4>he seemed fine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He did.</v>

1579
01:10:39.290 --> 01:10:42.440
<v Speaker 4>When he gave that last one at 1:30</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the morning and Michigan or whatever.</v>

1580
01:10:42.490 --> 01:10:44.540
<v Speaker 4>We're like six that day and he's just </v>
<v Speaker 4>like.</v>

1581
01:10:44.570 --> 01:10:45.900
<v Speaker 4>He just kept going.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1582
01:10:46.880 --> 01:10:48.880
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what fast food.</v>

1583
01:10:49.280 --> 01:10:50.220
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's eating pizza.</v>

1584
01:10:50.560 --> 01:10:53.050
<v Speaker 4>Fried Chicken,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Taco bowls.</v>

1585
01:10:53.100 --> 01:10:55.540
<v Speaker 4>TACO false.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember that picture when he's eating</v>

1586
01:10:55.560 --> 01:10:57.530
<v Speaker 4>a Taco bowl and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love Hispanics.</v>

1587
01:10:57.531 --> 01:11:00.170
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what in the fuck is this life?</v>

1588
01:11:01.340 --> 01:11:03.110
<v Speaker 4>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love Hispanics.</v>

1589
01:11:03.111 --> 01:11:07.670
<v Speaker 4>He's eating a Taco bowl in the office </v>
<v Speaker 4>where he runs his empire.</v>

1590
01:11:07.671 --> 01:11:08.840
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is madness.</v>

1591
01:11:08.870 --> 01:11:09.940
<v Speaker 4>That picture.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look at that.</v>

1592
01:11:09.950 --> 01:11:10.783
<v Speaker 4>A good look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The Best Taco bowls are made in trump </v>

1593
01:11:14.821 --> 01:11:17.250
<v Speaker 4>tower grille.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love Spanish.</v>

1594
01:11:17.940 --> 01:11:20.370
<v Speaker 4>That is so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so crazy.</v>

1595
01:11:20.670 --> 01:11:22.080
<v Speaker 4>The whole thing is insane.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Meanwhile,</v>

1596
01:11:22.170 --> 01:11:23.003
<v Speaker 4>he didn't even eat that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He pushed that aside and they brought </v>

1597
01:11:24.091 --> 01:11:24.924
<v Speaker 4>him a fucking ribeye sessions is going </v>
<v Speaker 4>to come in and this pot fund for the </v>

1598
01:11:28.231 --> 01:11:29.250
<v Speaker 4>nation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He really thinks so.</v>

1599
01:11:29.280 --> 01:11:30.440
<v Speaker 4>That's what they're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1600
01:11:30.450 --> 01:11:31.380
<v Speaker 4>That's not what they're saying.</v>

1601
01:11:31.490 --> 01:11:32.500
<v Speaker 4>If they're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1602
01:11:32.501 --> 01:11:33.060
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

1603
01:11:33.060 --> 01:11:33.893
<v Speaker 4>I've read all the articles.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's all speculation and it's based on </v>

1604
01:11:36.601 --> 01:11:37.434
<v Speaker 4>his statements.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it's based on his past statements </v>

1605
01:11:42.601 --> 01:11:43.434
<v Speaker 4>about marijuana not being for good </v>
<v Speaker 4>people and also based on what he could </v>

1606
01:11:46.681 --> 01:11:47.514
<v Speaker 4>potentially do as the attorney general.</v>
<v Speaker 4>However trump has said that he's going </v>

1607
01:11:51.391 --> 01:11:52.224
<v Speaker 4>to leave it up to the states.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that trump is a populist and I </v>

1608
01:11:54.961 --> 01:11:58.740
<v Speaker 4>think that the last thing trump wants </v>
<v Speaker 4>his people more people,</v>

1609
01:11:58.860 --> 01:12:03.000
<v Speaker 4>especially the potheads rallying against</v>
<v Speaker 4>them and saying this is preposterous.</v>

1610
01:12:03.001 --> 01:12:03.834
<v Speaker 4>If you look at the actual fear that that</v>
<v Speaker 4>people have about marijuana versus the </v>

1611
01:12:07.441 --> 01:12:11.460
<v Speaker 4>physical effects of marijuana versus the</v>
<v Speaker 4>potential revenue gain by these states.</v>

1612
01:12:11.730 --> 01:12:15.540
<v Speaker 4>Look at what's happened in Colorado real</v>
<v Speaker 4>estate sales rep for 14 percent.</v>

1613
01:12:16.260 --> 01:12:19.860
<v Speaker 4>Drunk driving is down to the lowest rate</v>
<v Speaker 4>it has in decades.</v>

1614
01:12:20.140 --> 01:12:22.260
<v Speaker 4>A violent crime is at the lowest rate.</v>

1615
01:12:22.260 --> 01:12:25.590
<v Speaker 4>It's been a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's so many positive benefits to the</v>

1616
01:12:25.620 --> 01:12:27.810
<v Speaker 4>marijuana legalization movement.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's amazing.</v>

1617
01:12:27.930 --> 01:12:31.200
<v Speaker 4>Isn't it amazing when you walk through </v>
<v Speaker 4>Denver with the change?</v>

1618
01:12:31.201 --> 01:12:32.730
<v Speaker 4>Prosperous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>

1619
01:12:33.030 --> 01:12:35.200
<v Speaker 4>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I went in and uh,</v>

1620
01:12:35.640 --> 01:12:39.750
<v Speaker 4>I went to one of the shops when I was </v>
<v Speaker 4>performing there last month and,</v>

1621
01:12:39.751 --> 01:12:41.670
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just wanted to go do it,</v>

1622
01:12:41.690 --> 01:12:43.290
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wasn't even looking to get high.</v>

1623
01:12:43.291 --> 01:12:44.124
<v Speaker 4>I just wanted to walk in and buy </v>
<v Speaker 4>something legit and walk out and just </v>

1624
01:12:47.311 --> 01:12:50.730
<v Speaker 4>see what that was like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Very rarely.</v>

1625
01:12:50.731 --> 01:12:52.370
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how about right now we're doing.</v>

1626
01:12:52.710 --> 01:12:53.890
<v Speaker 4>I do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I can't.</v>

1627
01:12:54.990 --> 01:12:55.823
<v Speaker 4>I got to pick up kids.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How frequently that if I do it my day </v>

1628
01:13:01.051 --> 01:13:03.090
<v Speaker 4>shot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what we're talking about.</v>

1629
01:13:03.091 --> 01:13:06.810
<v Speaker 4>Difficult things that make life easier.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of the difficult things I like to do</v>

1630
01:13:06.811 --> 01:13:09.510
<v Speaker 4>is edibles.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1631
01:13:09.511 --> 01:13:11.010
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's funny when you're special.</v>

1632
01:13:11.010 --> 01:13:12.930
<v Speaker 4>You actually talked about the gummy </v>
<v Speaker 4>bears.</v>

1633
01:13:12.980 --> 01:13:13.813
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I bought gummy bears when I was </v>

1634
01:13:15.211 --> 01:13:18.570
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is how out of it I am now.</v>

1635
01:13:18.600 --> 01:13:20.370
<v Speaker 4>Like I used to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I used to do it every day,</v>

1636
01:13:20.371 --> 01:13:22.950
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and now I haven't for like a decade.</v>

1637
01:13:23.370 --> 01:13:24.203
<v Speaker 4>I'm so out of it now that I got back to </v>
<v Speaker 4>my room with the gummy bears was like </v>

1638
01:13:26.790 --> 01:13:27.623
<v Speaker 4>scared.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We don't know how much do I take the </v>

1639
01:13:30.781 --> 01:13:31.940
<v Speaker 4>whole point.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's.</v>

1640
01:13:32.720 --> 01:13:33.553
<v Speaker 4>Know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really believe that they're like </v>

1641
01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:36.833
<v Speaker 4>running an ultra marathon or something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you should be scared when you take </v>

1642
01:13:39.361 --> 01:13:40.530
<v Speaker 4>those first couple of steps.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

1643
01:13:40.531 --> 01:13:42.060
<v Speaker 4>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what am I getting myself into?</v>

1644
01:13:42.420 --> 01:13:43.253
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's.</v>

1645
01:13:43.710 --> 01:13:45.270
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm old school.</v>

1646
01:13:45.271 --> 01:13:46.104
<v Speaker 4>I guess I like it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd like to see it and crumble it and </v>

1647
01:13:47.690 --> 01:13:50.130
<v Speaker 4>puff it and know exactly what I'm doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's nice too,</v>

1648
01:13:50.131 --> 01:13:50.964
<v Speaker 4>but it's a different thing than the </v>
<v Speaker 4>eating and the eating and the eating it </v>

1649
01:13:53.820 --> 01:13:55.630
<v Speaker 4>because it's scary.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1650
01:13:55.810 --> 01:13:57.570
<v Speaker 4>be for that reason.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1651
01:13:57.600 --> 01:13:59.750
<v Speaker 4>I liked the journey.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like it.</v>

1652
01:13:59.751 --> 01:14:02.760
<v Speaker 4>It,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it makes me feel super vulnerable and it</v>

1653
01:14:02.761 --> 01:14:03.594
<v Speaker 4>makes me feel like really in tune with </v>
<v Speaker 4>any weird distractions I might have in </v>

1654
01:14:08.461 --> 01:14:09.294
<v Speaker 4>my psyche.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Any weird bumps in the night that are </v>

1655
01:14:11.171 --> 01:14:12.040
<v Speaker 4>haunting the back</v>

1656
01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:14.920
<v Speaker 5>of my brain.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It just drags them out like get out here</v>

1657
01:14:14.921 --> 01:14:15.754
<v Speaker 5>in the front,</v>
<v Speaker 5>pulls them and put a spotlight on the </v>

1658
01:14:17.560 --> 01:14:19.870
<v Speaker 5>click.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Tell me what's wrong.</v>

1659
01:14:24.070 --> 01:14:25.690
<v Speaker 1>I just want to get high and watch </v>
<v Speaker 1>narcos.</v>

1660
01:14:26.890 --> 01:14:29.660
<v Speaker 1>I like that to really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you do it literally.</v>

1661
01:14:29.670 --> 01:14:30.950
<v Speaker 1>Are you joking?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1662
01:14:30.960 --> 01:14:31.620
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm dead.</v>

1663
01:14:31.620 --> 01:14:34.180
<v Speaker 1>I'm dead serious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the little bit of the unknown.</v>

1664
01:14:35.050 --> 01:14:38.680
<v Speaker 1>Almost trippy kind of anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when you eat mushrooms or something</v>

1665
01:14:38.681 --> 01:14:39.970
<v Speaker 1>and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1666
01:14:39.971 --> 01:14:41.320
<v Speaker 1>let's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's going to come out with.</v>

1667
01:14:41.350 --> 01:14:42.183
<v Speaker 1>Where are we headed?</v>

1668
01:14:42.220 --> 01:14:43.053
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's why I liked the sensory </v>

1669
01:14:43.271 --> 01:14:46.390
<v Speaker 5>deprivation tank too because you can't </v>
<v Speaker 5>run from your thoughts,</v>

1670
01:14:46.900 --> 01:14:48.940
<v Speaker 5>traps you with your thoughts and you </v>
<v Speaker 5>have to confront them.</v>

1671
01:14:48.970 --> 01:14:51.280
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's the what I call the hard work,</v>

1672
01:14:51.400 --> 01:14:53.710
<v Speaker 5>like doing the hard work,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the mental hard work.</v>

1673
01:14:54.230 --> 01:14:55.570
<v Speaker 5>It was like you got be like I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I.</v>

1674
01:14:56.530 --> 01:14:59.110
<v Speaker 5>One of the things I've tried,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have tried to pride myself in,</v>

1675
01:14:59.111 --> 01:15:03.170
<v Speaker 5>at least I shouldn't say.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One of the things I've done as a,</v>

1676
01:15:03.171 --> 01:15:04.004
<v Speaker 5>an exercise and as I've done it like as </v>
<v Speaker 5>a discipline is try to constantly and </v>

1677
01:15:12.071 --> 01:15:14.740
<v Speaker 5>consistently improve everything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I do whatever I'm doing,</v>

1678
01:15:14.741 --> 01:15:15.574
<v Speaker 5>whether it's martial art thing or or </v>
<v Speaker 5>comedy thing and I feel like your </v>

1679
01:15:19.751 --> 01:15:23.120
<v Speaker 5>personality is in that too and even </v>
<v Speaker 5>podcasting is in that,</v>

1680
01:15:23.170 --> 01:15:24.003
<v Speaker 5>like anything that you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you just try to do better and I don't </v>

1681
01:15:27.131 --> 01:15:28.690
<v Speaker 5>always succeed,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there's a,</v>

1682
01:15:28.691 --> 01:15:29.524
<v Speaker 5>there's a journey and a process along </v>
<v Speaker 5>the way and what I've found is the hard </v>

1683
01:15:32.651 --> 01:15:33.484
<v Speaker 5>work is the best way for me to really </v>
<v Speaker 5>judge my progress and all those things </v>

1684
01:15:37.330 --> 01:15:38.163
<v Speaker 5>because I'm forced to be alone with my </v>
<v Speaker 5>thoughts and to be at least the way I </v>

1685
01:15:43.001 --> 01:15:43.450
<v Speaker 5>approach it.</v>

1686
01:15:43.450 --> 01:15:47.890
<v Speaker 5>I try to be as objective as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm my number one biggest critic.</v>

1687
01:15:48.100 --> 01:15:52.090
<v Speaker 5>Like I fucking hate everything I do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's why you're good.</v>

1688
01:15:52.270 --> 01:15:53.103
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When you sit alone with your thoughts </v>

1689
01:15:54.581 --> 01:15:55.414
<v Speaker 5>and you think about everything you do </v>
<v Speaker 5>and you could pick it apart and find </v>

1690
01:15:58.240 --> 01:15:59.080
<v Speaker 5>problems with it.</v>

1691
01:15:59.520 --> 01:16:00.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the hard work.</v>

1692
01:16:00.720 --> 01:16:01.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

1693
01:16:01.561 --> 01:16:03.210
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a big thing.</v>

1694
01:16:03.240 --> 01:16:04.560
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

1695
01:16:05.130 --> 01:16:05.963
<v Speaker 1>smoking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let you come in the other door and take </v>

1696
01:16:07.261 --> 01:16:10.560
<v Speaker 1>a look at what you thought was okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

1697
01:16:10.561 --> 01:16:11.394
<v Speaker 1>If you think like if you've got the </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure and you think you're being </v>

1698
01:16:12.961 --> 01:16:15.810
<v Speaker 1>hard on yourself and then you come in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the back door and you're like,</v>

1699
01:16:15.870 --> 01:16:18.450
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe I'm a little hacky over here.</v>

1700
01:16:18.540 --> 01:16:21.150
<v Speaker 1>You can take some of this and go through</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fucking roof.</v>

1701
01:16:21.450 --> 01:16:24.180
<v Speaker 1>Like an asteroid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck that door.</v>

1702
01:16:24.720 --> 01:16:26.640
<v Speaker 1>You don't want the door.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got a lot of stuff in here,</v>

1703
01:16:26.641 --> 01:16:27.960
<v Speaker 1>buddy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went,</v>

1704
01:16:27.990 --> 01:16:29.730
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was funny was he was one of these.</v>

1705
01:16:29.731 --> 01:16:32.310
<v Speaker 1>Or put you on the moon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's that?</v>

1706
01:16:32.520 --> 01:16:33.353
<v Speaker 1>Chocolate cheese.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can smell the pot through the </v>

1707
01:16:36.331 --> 01:16:41.010
<v Speaker 1>wrapper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to know what I'm getting into.</v>

1708
01:16:41.040 --> 01:16:46.040
<v Speaker 1>Getting into death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>death and just the inevitability.</v>

1709
01:16:46.910 --> 01:16:50.850
<v Speaker 1>The only I can see from the pills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pills,</v>

1710
01:16:51.480 --> 01:16:52.770
<v Speaker 1>pills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me see what they look like.</v>

1711
01:16:53.040 --> 01:16:55.680
<v Speaker 1>The only negative I could see one </v>
<v Speaker 1>walking around Denver was.</v>

1712
01:16:55.681 --> 01:16:59.940
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of scuzzy skate pothead </v>
<v Speaker 1>kids that are like laying on the street.</v>

1713
01:17:00.210 --> 01:17:02.340
<v Speaker 1>You're always gonna get that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1714
01:17:02.341 --> 01:17:05.430
<v Speaker 1>but it's a little different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just part of the problem.</v>

1715
01:17:05.730 --> 01:17:06.190
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1716
01:17:06.190 --> 01:17:07.260
<v Speaker 1>you always get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1717
01:17:07.261 --> 01:17:10.040
<v Speaker 1>there's always the 14 always going to be</v>

1718
01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:12.320
<v Speaker 4>the case.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was funny coming out with my bag,</v>

1719
01:17:12.800 --> 01:17:16.700
<v Speaker 4>filled with stuff and not being afraid </v>
<v Speaker 4>of the cops who just waved to me.</v>

1720
01:17:16.701 --> 01:17:21.300
<v Speaker 4>But then the pot heads who want it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sorry,</v>

1721
01:17:21.580 --> 01:17:24.230
<v Speaker 4>Geez,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got stuff to do.</v>

1722
01:17:24.390 --> 01:17:25.360
<v Speaker 4>You'll be fine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

1723
01:17:25.370 --> 01:17:26.890
<v Speaker 4>my secondhand smoke barely does </v>
<v Speaker 4>anything.</v>

1724
01:17:26.900 --> 01:17:31.900
<v Speaker 4>I'm like your pet dog.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got my dog so high once I had a um,</v>

1725
01:17:32.260 --> 01:17:35.210
<v Speaker 4>a rescue dog and she was a big sweetie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I loved her.</v>

1726
01:17:36.560 --> 01:17:39.020
<v Speaker 4>She had a rough life before I got her.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When I got her,</v>

1727
01:17:39.021 --> 01:17:40.600
<v Speaker 4>she had mange.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh ma'am.</v>

1728
01:17:40.800 --> 01:17:45.800
<v Speaker 4>Oh she,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got her because someone who I knew had</v>

1729
01:17:46.671 --> 01:17:47.504
<v Speaker 4>rescued her like that day and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was in la and they had found her </v>

1730
01:17:52.910 --> 01:17:56.600
<v Speaker 4>eating out of a garbage can and she was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she was all fucked up,</v>

1731
01:17:56.860 --> 01:18:01.010
<v Speaker 4>like main Ge.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they contacted me and they said,</v>

1732
01:18:01.011 --> 01:18:03.290
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just a long shot.</v>

1733
01:18:03.290 --> 01:18:05.360
<v Speaker 4>Do you want to adopt a dog?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because I had a dog.</v>

1734
01:18:05.960 --> 01:18:06.591
<v Speaker 4>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1735
01:18:06.591 --> 01:18:07.424
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>probably wouldn't be a bad idea to have </v>

1736
01:18:08.241 --> 01:18:09.110
<v Speaker 4>my dog,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1737
01:18:09.140 --> 01:18:12.560
<v Speaker 4>get a companion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I go and then they told me and I'm like,</v>

1738
01:18:12.620 --> 01:18:13.700
<v Speaker 4>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1739
01:18:13.701 --> 01:18:15.040
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a lot to take on.</v>

1740
01:18:15.060 --> 01:18:17.270
<v Speaker 4>And checked her out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Was she older?</v>

1741
01:18:17.850 --> 01:18:18.710
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she was,</v>

1742
01:18:18.860 --> 01:18:22.070
<v Speaker 4>she had had babies for sure because her </v>
<v Speaker 4>nipples were extended.</v>

1743
01:18:22.130 --> 01:18:22.963
<v Speaker 4>We didn't really know how old she was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She was probably in the neighborhood of </v>

1744
01:18:25.611 --> 01:18:27.650
<v Speaker 4>two or three,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but she was the sweetest dog ever.</v>

1745
01:18:27.651 --> 01:18:29.080
<v Speaker 4>She so sweet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What kind?</v>

1746
01:18:29.380 --> 01:18:32.120
<v Speaker 4>She was a pit bull.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She had a rough life.</v>

1747
01:18:32.180 --> 01:18:34.080
<v Speaker 4>It was a rough life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>

1748
01:18:34.190 --> 01:18:36.720
<v Speaker 4>when I had her in my house,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1749
01:18:36.800 --> 01:18:38.420
<v Speaker 4>Joey Diaz and I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>

1750
01:18:38.480 --> 01:18:39.200
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1751
01:18:39.200 --> 01:18:40.033
<v Speaker 4>went into my office and she would come </v>
<v Speaker 4>in the office and hang out with me and </v>

1752
01:18:42.921 --> 01:18:47.921
<v Speaker 4>we did bong hit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>bong hit and this poor dog got hot box.</v>

1753
01:18:50.150 --> 01:18:53.600
<v Speaker 4>Figure out what was going on because she</v>
<v Speaker 4>was freaking out,</v>

1754
01:18:54.440 --> 01:18:57.620
<v Speaker 4>freaking out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And she was like hiding under desks.</v>

1755
01:18:57.800 --> 01:18:58.633
<v Speaker 4>Like she would run,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she would run across the room and they </v>

1756
01:19:00.901 --> 01:19:05.330
<v Speaker 4>just get under the desk or I guess </v>
<v Speaker 4>tucked in and we're like,</v>

1757
01:19:05.360 --> 01:19:06.580
<v Speaker 4>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she's high.</v>

1758
01:19:06.770 --> 01:19:08.260
<v Speaker 4>The poor dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hi.</v>

1759
01:19:09.270 --> 01:19:11.270
<v Speaker 4>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can get someone,</v>

1760
01:19:11.750 --> 01:19:12.800
<v Speaker 4>you can get that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1761
01:19:14.250 --> 01:19:16.160
<v Speaker 4>I uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can,</v>

1762
01:19:16.550 --> 01:19:17.510
<v Speaker 4>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1763
01:19:17.990 --> 01:19:19.270
<v Speaker 4>I hope you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I hope that,</v>

1764
01:19:19.340 --> 01:19:21.020
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the most interesting thing watching</v>

1765
01:19:21.021 --> 01:19:23.870
<v Speaker 4>this whole trump thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I hope you're right about sessions,</v>

1766
01:19:24.350 --> 01:19:27.350
<v Speaker 4>I think it's going to be really </v>
<v Speaker 4>interesting.</v>

1767
01:19:27.740 --> 01:19:28.573
<v Speaker 4>I feel like we're watching one of those </v>
<v Speaker 4>movies where like the regular guy </v>

1768
01:19:30.861 --> 01:19:33.740
<v Speaker 4>becomes president and he comes in like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1769
01:19:33.741 --> 01:19:36.740
<v Speaker 4>just fix the problem,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just the taxes and fix the bridge.</v>

1770
01:19:36.770 --> 01:19:39.170
<v Speaker 4>That's how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And like these practical,</v>

1771
01:19:39.420 --> 01:19:40.253
<v Speaker 4>like things that you could do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like let's just talk to Taiwan and </v>

1772
01:19:43.251 --> 01:19:46.250
<v Speaker 4>Siemens maybe they'll be okay and it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1773
01:19:46.310 --> 01:19:51.310
<v Speaker 4>will this work or do or is the way of </v>
<v Speaker 4>operating with so immeshed in policy and</v>

1774
01:19:53.340 --> 01:19:54.173
<v Speaker 4>the way that things were,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you need that structure to actually </v>

1775
01:19:57.680 --> 01:19:58.513
<v Speaker 4>steer the ship?</v>

1776
01:19:58.940 --> 01:19:59.773
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is really kind of free form your </v>

1777
01:20:05.090 --> 01:20:05.923
<v Speaker 4>writing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think in that sense that's probably </v>

1778
01:20:06.741 --> 01:20:08.040
<v Speaker 4>the most positive aspect</v>

1779
01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:11.400
<v Speaker 5>of this guy being president is that we </v>
<v Speaker 5>really will find out.</v>

1780
01:20:11.460 --> 01:20:12.293
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it might be the only way we find out </v>

1781
01:20:13.750 --> 01:20:16.680
<v Speaker 5>where you're going to find out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We've got to really find out to find.</v>

1782
01:20:16.750 --> 01:20:17.583
<v Speaker 5>And also he's going to fucking tell us </v>
<v Speaker 5>like if there's some shit is funky </v>

1783
01:20:21.961 --> 01:20:23.460
<v Speaker 5>behind the scenes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1784
01:20:23.480 --> 01:20:24.313
<v Speaker 5>like there's a lot of talk online about </v>
<v Speaker 5>trump lying and his tweets about like </v>

1785
01:20:29.880 --> 01:20:31.310
<v Speaker 5>fake votes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1786
01:20:31.320 --> 01:20:33.340
<v Speaker 5>like fake votes cost him the popular </v>
<v Speaker 5>vote.</v>

1787
01:20:33.380 --> 01:20:38.190
<v Speaker 5>Like he just sometimes he just says shit</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

1788
01:20:38.230 --> 01:20:41.250
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if he is doing it as a </v>
<v Speaker 5>strategy.</v>

1789
01:20:41.490 --> 01:20:42.270
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1790
01:20:42.270 --> 01:20:42.901
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

1791
01:20:42.901 --> 01:20:43.500
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

1792
01:20:43.500 --> 01:20:45.870
<v Speaker 5>it's also possible that he doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 5>really believe it,</v>

1793
01:20:46.050 --> 01:20:48.150
<v Speaker 5>but that he knows that if he puts it out</v>
<v Speaker 5>there,</v>

1794
01:20:48.240 --> 01:20:49.840
<v Speaker 5>people are going to repeat it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1795
01:20:50.040 --> 01:20:51.990
<v Speaker 5>There was an article in recently that I </v>
<v Speaker 5>saw,</v>

1796
01:20:52.080 --> 01:20:53.520
<v Speaker 5>I forget what the magazine was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jamie,</v>

1797
01:20:53.521 --> 01:20:54.354
<v Speaker 5>maybe you could find it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it was about a guy who writes the </v>

1798
01:20:55.861 --> 01:20:56.694
<v Speaker 5>fake news and they track this dude down </v>
<v Speaker 5>and he just writes fake stories like </v>

1799
01:21:02.280 --> 01:21:07.280
<v Speaker 5>about George Soros paying protests is </v>
<v Speaker 5>350 bucks an hour to test against trump.</v>

1800
01:21:07.430 --> 01:21:09.010
<v Speaker 5>Like you just make stuff up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1801
01:21:09.270 --> 01:21:12.780
<v Speaker 5>And they asked him why he did it and </v>
<v Speaker 5>what he said was,</v>

1802
01:21:12.781 --> 01:21:13.614
<v Speaker 5>he said essentially he started out as </v>
<v Speaker 5>like an exercise we'll sort of to prove </v>

1803
01:21:17.910 --> 01:21:21.420
<v Speaker 5>how gullible these all right folks could</v>
<v Speaker 5>be.</v>

1804
01:21:21.810 --> 01:21:22.643
<v Speaker 5>Some of them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>at least some of them would just see </v>

1805
01:21:24.631 --> 01:21:27.680
<v Speaker 5>things without looking into it at all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They would just start tweeting it.</v>

1806
01:21:27.690 --> 01:21:28.680
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know.</v>

1807
01:21:28.681 --> 01:21:29.790
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and he was right.</v>

1808
01:21:29.791 --> 01:21:31.980
<v Speaker 5>He was right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But he started making a lot of money.</v>

1809
01:21:32.330 --> 01:21:34.230
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>These guys are making like $10,000</v>

1810
01:21:34.231 --> 01:21:37.210
<v Speaker 5>a month writing fake store clicks of </v>
<v Speaker 5>clicks.</v>

1811
01:21:37.350 --> 01:21:38.550
<v Speaker 5>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1812
01:21:38.730 --> 01:21:41.490
<v Speaker 5>Then you're writing fake stories.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now we're going to pass that up.</v>

1813
01:21:41.550 --> 01:21:42.383
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're going to just write fake stories </v>

1814
01:21:43.711 --> 01:21:44.544
<v Speaker 5>now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So like what you were saying earlier </v>

1815
01:21:45.661 --> 01:21:50.220
<v Speaker 5>about like us entering into an era where</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can't really tell what's true or not</v>

1816
01:21:50.221 --> 01:21:53.550
<v Speaker 5>true.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And like if that's the case,</v>

1817
01:21:53.570 --> 01:21:57.090
<v Speaker 5>I mean that's why it's so imperative </v>
<v Speaker 5>that someone like the Washington Post or</v>

1818
01:21:57.270 --> 01:22:00.510
<v Speaker 5>the New York Times cannot be biased in </v>
<v Speaker 5>any way.</v>

1819
01:22:00.720 --> 01:22:01.553
<v Speaker 5>You have to like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as clearly as you can emphasize the </v>

1820
01:22:04.621 --> 01:22:05.454
<v Speaker 5>facts of every story.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Even if you feel like you have an </v>

1821
01:22:07.711 --> 01:22:10.890
<v Speaker 5>obligation to show how horrible person </v>
<v Speaker 5>president trump is,</v>

1822
01:22:10.891 --> 01:22:11.940
<v Speaker 5>just to let people know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

1823
01:22:11.941 --> 01:22:14.910
<v Speaker 5>this guy can't get in the office.</v>
<v Speaker 5>As soon as you start doing that,</v>

1824
01:22:14.911 --> 01:22:15.744
<v Speaker 5>you embolden the people who oppose you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like it's very dangerous for ideas in </v>

1825
01:22:19.771 --> 01:22:22.980
<v Speaker 5>general because it's so hard.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I.</v>

1826
01:22:23.190 --> 01:22:24.300
<v Speaker 5>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't do it,</v>

1827
01:22:24.301 --> 01:22:25.134
<v Speaker 5>but it's so.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's so hard for anybody to completely </v>

1828
01:22:27.721 --> 01:22:30.660
<v Speaker 5>be unbiased and establish just the </v>
<v Speaker 5>facts.</v>

1829
01:22:30.661 --> 01:22:32.250
<v Speaker 5>Even when they're disturbing and </v>
<v Speaker 5>uncomfortable.</v>

1830
01:22:33.170 --> 01:22:34.950
<v Speaker 5>They don't like that too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People don't like that.</v>

1831
01:22:34.980 --> 01:22:37.800
<v Speaker 5>You ever watch PBS news?</v>
<v Speaker 5>The News Hour?</v>

1832
01:22:37.860 --> 01:22:40.260
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's probably as pure as you can get,</v>

1833
01:22:40.710 --> 01:22:41.543
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean that's just purely as factual as </v>

1834
01:22:44.071 --> 01:22:49.071
<v Speaker 5>we can put it out there and it doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 5>mirror a lot of anything else.</v>

1835
01:22:50.880 --> 01:22:52.290
<v Speaker 5>CNN,</v>
<v Speaker 5>MSNBC,</v>

1836
01:22:52.300 --> 01:22:55.830
<v Speaker 5>or Fox,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's all that.</v>

1837
01:22:55.940 --> 01:22:56.773
<v Speaker 5>That PBS has.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just it feels like it's the last place </v>

1838
01:22:59.221 --> 01:23:02.220
<v Speaker 5>where grownups work.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This person makes $10,000</v>

1839
01:23:02.221 --> 01:23:05.010
<v Speaker 5>a month writing fake news.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1840
01:23:05.480 --> 01:23:06.060
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This</v>

1841
01:23:06.060 --> 01:23:08.160
<v Speaker 3>is just make stuff up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what is the website?</v>

1842
01:23:08.161 --> 01:23:10.950
<v Speaker 3>Jamie?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This one was from market watchers,</v>

1843
01:23:10.970 --> 01:23:11.803
<v Speaker 3>also an NPR story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the Martin watches the one that </v>

1844
01:23:13.411 --> 01:23:14.420
<v Speaker 3>I read.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's the,</v>

1845
01:23:14.470 --> 01:23:15.303
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1846
01:23:15.720 --> 01:23:16.553
<v Speaker 3>one of the problems with the fake news </v>
<v Speaker 3>too is I have a guy drives me to the </v>

1847
01:23:18.961 --> 01:23:21.480
<v Speaker 3>airport all the time and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1848
01:23:21.481 --> 01:23:26.070
<v Speaker 3>I saw George Soros is paying the people </v>
<v Speaker 3>to protest and my wife,</v>

1849
01:23:26.071 --> 01:23:28.590
<v Speaker 3>I saw it on facebook and my wife said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1850
01:23:28.591 --> 01:23:30.000
<v Speaker 3>that's not a story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he said,</v>

1851
01:23:30.240 --> 01:23:31.800
<v Speaker 3>but look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now it's on CNN.</v>

1852
01:23:31.801 --> 01:23:34.140
<v Speaker 3>They're talking about the same story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it is true.</v>

1853
01:23:34.560 --> 01:23:37.650
<v Speaker 3>The problem is all these people editing </v>
<v Speaker 3>these news organizations,</v>

1854
01:23:37.890 --> 01:23:38.723
<v Speaker 3>they're running with the story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're being tricked by the fake news </v>

1855
01:23:40.650 --> 01:23:42.090
<v Speaker 3>to begin with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1856
01:23:42.720 --> 01:23:44.010
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

1857
01:23:44.040 --> 01:23:44.873
<v Speaker 3>It's very slippery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She see the fake porn going on at CNN </v>

1858
01:23:48.211 --> 01:23:49.044
<v Speaker 3>for 30 minutes of fake porn during </v>
<v Speaker 3>Anthony Bourdain show out like </v>

1859
01:23:51.871 --> 01:23:52.830
<v Speaker 3>Thanksgiving night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1860
01:23:52.870 --> 01:23:54.890
<v Speaker 3>It's a total fake story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone else did it.</v>

1861
01:23:54.900 --> 01:23:55.733
<v Speaker 3>That it was real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1862
01:23:56.630 --> 01:23:57.191
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That,</v>

1863
01:23:57.191 --> 01:23:58.730
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that was something somebody just thought</v>

1864
01:23:58.731 --> 01:23:59.564
<v Speaker 5>it'd be funny to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did he even have a photoshop screenshot </v>

1865
01:24:01.881 --> 01:24:02.930
<v Speaker 5>or something like that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1866
01:24:03.060 --> 01:24:04.990
<v Speaker 3>that's genius.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's,</v>

1867
01:24:05.020 --> 01:24:08.010
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the scary thing is a,</v>

1868
01:24:08.220 --> 01:24:10.230
<v Speaker 3>that's how wars start,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1869
01:24:10.290 --> 01:24:11.123
<v Speaker 3>That's how Vietnam started getting a </v>
<v Speaker 3>little carried away when they created </v>

1870
01:24:13.831 --> 01:24:16.830
<v Speaker 3>the take down a notch where we created </v>
<v Speaker 3>this fake stories,</v>

1871
01:24:17.520 --> 01:24:19.230
<v Speaker 3>Iraq,</v>
<v Speaker 3>same stuff.</v>

1872
01:24:19.250 --> 01:24:20.820
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can manipulate stuff.</v>

1873
01:24:20.821 --> 01:24:23.550
<v Speaker 3>You can create big events off of that.</v>

1874
01:24:23.640 --> 01:24:26.340
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>here obviously we don't know what really</v>

1875
01:24:26.520 --> 01:24:29.850
<v Speaker 5>has gone on that lead to people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right in that pizza gate stuff.</v>

1876
01:24:29.851 --> 01:24:30.684
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't investigate it enough to know </v>

1877
01:24:31.741 --> 01:24:32.574
<v Speaker 5>if it's bullshit or not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just didn't look into it and to be </v>

1878
01:24:34.651 --> 01:24:36.360
<v Speaker 5>honest,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's it.</v>

1879
01:24:37.050 --> 01:24:37.883
<v Speaker 5>What if it was bullshit and if it is </v>
<v Speaker 5>bullshit and this guy thought it was </v>

1880
01:24:41.191 --> 01:24:45.670
<v Speaker 5>real and he goes in and what have you </v>
<v Speaker 5>shot somebody who's as.</v>

1881
01:24:46.230 --> 01:24:47.063
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>at what point is there some sort of </v>

1882
01:24:49.561 --> 01:24:53.250
<v Speaker 5>responsibility like as a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as a culture,</v>

1883
01:24:53.280 --> 01:24:56.420
<v Speaker 5>like when,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if someone's inciting hate towards him,</v>

1884
01:24:56.421 --> 01:24:59.610
<v Speaker 5>very specific establishment that really </v>
<v Speaker 5>hasn't done anything wrong,</v>

1885
01:24:59.611 --> 01:25:01.890
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like that's kind of a criminal act,</v>

1886
01:25:01.891 --> 01:25:03.300
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>In a way,</v>

1887
01:25:03.900 --> 01:25:06.390
<v Speaker 5>if you're saying like if you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you pick a donut shop,</v>

1888
01:25:06.391 --> 01:25:06.781
<v Speaker 5>yum,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yum.</v>

1889
01:25:06.781 --> 01:25:08.550
<v Speaker 5>Donuts side of yum.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yum.</v>

1890
01:25:08.551 --> 01:25:10.680
<v Speaker 5>Donuts is where the elites go to fuck </v>
<v Speaker 5>kids,</v>

1891
01:25:10.740 --> 01:25:10.950
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1892
01:25:10.950 --> 01:25:13.590
<v Speaker 5>You just make all that up and then </v>
<v Speaker 5>people show up a yum,</v>

1893
01:25:13.591 --> 01:25:17.010
<v Speaker 5>yum donuts and just start shooting </v>
<v Speaker 5>people because you won't tell them where</v>

1894
01:25:17.011 --> 01:25:19.920
<v Speaker 5>you're fucking the kids.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's decades.</v>

1895
01:25:20.220 --> 01:25:21.960
<v Speaker 5>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is just.</v>

1896
01:25:21.961 --> 01:25:23.420
<v Speaker 5>If it's a fake story,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

1897
01:25:23.540 --> 01:25:24.900
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Shit.</v>

1898
01:25:25.020 --> 01:25:26.580
<v Speaker 5>I'm just going to be real clear about </v>
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

1899
01:25:26.790 --> 01:25:28.260
<v Speaker 5>I literally have.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I.</v>

1900
01:25:28.261 --> 01:25:29.550
<v Speaker 5>There's so much kids who.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1901
01:25:29.600 --> 01:25:30.750
<v Speaker 5>you should look into it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1902
01:25:30.900 --> 01:25:33.000
<v Speaker 5>I shouldn't you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you want to.</v>

1903
01:25:33.030 --> 01:25:33.863
<v Speaker 5>You go ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Dear.</v>

1904
01:25:33.890 --> 01:25:38.890
<v Speaker 5>You cannot be responsible for every </v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking story that's in the news today.</v>

1905
01:25:39.120 --> 01:25:43.050
<v Speaker 5>You will lose your mind and I'm trying </v>
<v Speaker 5>to do less and less of that in my life,</v>

1906
01:25:43.470 --> 01:25:47.640
<v Speaker 5>but my point is what we know for a fact.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of fake stories.</v>

1907
01:25:48.090 --> 01:25:50.190
<v Speaker 5>We also know for a fact.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of creeps.</v>

1908
01:25:50.430 --> 01:25:51.780
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a lot of scary,</v>

1909
01:25:51.781 --> 01:25:52.614
<v Speaker 5>sketchy people that are in positions of </v>
<v Speaker 5>power and they have been forever and </v>

1910
01:25:55.950 --> 01:25:58.830
<v Speaker 5>they're starting to get exposed more </v>
<v Speaker 5>than they ever have been before,</v>

1911
01:25:58.831 --> 01:25:59.550
<v Speaker 5>so I don't know the</v>

1912
01:25:59.550 --> 01:26:01.770
<v Speaker 3>fuck the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's kind of the interesting thing.</v>

1913
01:26:02.130 --> 01:26:05.270
<v Speaker 3>That's it's the good and bad of the time</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we live in.</v>

1914
01:26:06.350 --> 01:26:08.630
<v Speaker 3>Everything can be exposed now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is great.</v>

1915
01:26:08.660 --> 01:26:12.230
<v Speaker 3>Like you can expose people being brutal </v>
<v Speaker 3>to another group.</v>

1916
01:26:12.231 --> 01:26:15.200
<v Speaker 3>You can expose crimes by just recording </v>
<v Speaker 3>it on your phone.</v>

1917
01:26:15.590 --> 01:26:16.423
<v Speaker 3>You can't get away with stuff anymore </v>
<v Speaker 3>because everyone's on video all the </v>

1918
01:26:20.271 --> 01:26:22.400
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So in that way,</v>

1919
01:26:22.460 --> 01:26:26.360
<v Speaker 3>the truth has never been more clear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if it's.</v>

1920
01:26:26.410 --> 01:26:27.243
<v Speaker 3>But then you have this manipulation of </v>
<v Speaker 3>that truth in certain instances where </v>

1921
01:26:29.871 --> 01:26:32.180
<v Speaker 3>you don't have that video proof.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's uh,</v>

1922
01:26:32.760 --> 01:26:35.180
<v Speaker 3>it's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's very conflicting.</v>

1923
01:26:35.350 --> 01:26:36.183
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's what we were talking about earlier </v>

1924
01:26:37.151 --> 01:26:39.640
<v Speaker 5>when we were saying about fake stories </v>
<v Speaker 5>that it's,</v>

1925
01:26:39.700 --> 01:26:44.530
<v Speaker 5>we're getting to this weird era where </v>
<v Speaker 5>you can't tell whether or not a story is</v>

1926
01:26:44.531 --> 01:26:46.170
<v Speaker 5>true or not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like he gets really sketchy,</v>

1927
01:26:46.210 --> 01:26:49.480
<v Speaker 5>gets really strange.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think there's going to be.</v>

1928
01:26:49.570 --> 01:26:53.560
<v Speaker 5>This is just pure speculation,</v>
<v Speaker 5>pure bro Science.</v>

1929
01:26:53.770 --> 01:26:55.090
<v Speaker 5>Nice.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Giving you a bro.</v>

1930
01:26:55.091 --> 01:26:55.924
<v Speaker 5>Science warning.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My favorite kind is the only kind of </v>

1931
01:26:57.311 --> 01:26:58.144
<v Speaker 5>understand I think the other doing these</v>
<v Speaker 5>things where they're able to transmit </v>

1932
01:27:02.980 --> 01:27:05.710
<v Speaker 5>words from person to person through the </v>
<v Speaker 5>Internet,</v>

1933
01:27:06.190 --> 01:27:09.490
<v Speaker 5>brain to brain.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like somehow or another I can't,</v>

1934
01:27:09.491 --> 01:27:11.260
<v Speaker 5>I'm not going to do a good job </v>
<v Speaker 5>explaining it,</v>

1935
01:27:11.650 --> 01:27:12.483
<v Speaker 5>but they've been able to essentially put</v>
<v Speaker 5>a word in your head and then do it </v>

1936
01:27:16.811 --> 01:27:17.644
<v Speaker 5>accurately from a long distance away </v>
<v Speaker 5>through some sort of electrical impulse </v>

1937
01:27:21.161 --> 01:27:22.870
<v Speaker 5>or something that they blast into your </v>
<v Speaker 5>head,</v>

1938
01:27:23.230 --> 01:27:26.410
<v Speaker 5>but right now it's like like a word,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a word.</v>

1939
01:27:27.880 --> 01:27:28.713
<v Speaker 5>I think it's entirely possible within </v>
<v Speaker 5>our lifetime that one day someone is </v>

1940
01:27:33.521 --> 01:27:35.620
<v Speaker 5>going to figure out how.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you can do that,</v>

1941
01:27:35.621 --> 01:27:36.454
<v Speaker 5>if you could transmit something from </v>
<v Speaker 5>brain to brain like that through the </v>

1942
01:27:38.021 --> 01:27:39.460
<v Speaker 5>Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 5>through some sort of an interface,</v>

1943
01:27:39.850 --> 01:27:44.740
<v Speaker 5>they're going to figure out how to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How to broadcast intention,</v>

1944
01:27:45.250 --> 01:27:46.083
<v Speaker 5>so instead of a language,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're going to figure out how to </v>

1945
01:27:49.421 --> 01:27:54.250
<v Speaker 5>broadcast what the feeling is behind you</v>
<v Speaker 5>thinking something like if I say,</v>

1946
01:27:54.490 --> 01:27:55.660
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Tom,</v>

1947
01:27:55.661 --> 01:27:59.110
<v Speaker 5>papa has a comedy special on epics this </v>
<v Speaker 5>Friday night,</v>

1948
01:27:59.111 --> 01:28:01.000
<v Speaker 5>you should definitely see it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's fucking hilarious.</v>

1949
01:28:01.001 --> 01:28:04.120
<v Speaker 5>He's a great guy and I really want you </v>
<v Speaker 5>guys to check that out.</v>

1950
01:28:04.210 --> 01:28:07.540
<v Speaker 5>There's a feeling that comes with that </v>
<v Speaker 5>of feeling like,</v>

1951
01:28:07.570 --> 01:28:08.770
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I really love you.</v>

1952
01:28:08.771 --> 01:28:10.270
<v Speaker 5>You're a great guy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're hilarious.</v>

1953
01:28:10.271 --> 01:28:14.770
<v Speaker 5>I want your specialty to kick ass,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but so that's like an intention and that</v>

1954
01:28:14.771 --> 01:28:19.771
<v Speaker 5>intention is in some way trapped inside </v>
<v Speaker 5>a language.</v>

1955
01:28:20.470 --> 01:28:25.470
<v Speaker 5>It's trapped inside like language in </v>
<v Speaker 5>civilization and all the structures that</v>

1956
01:28:26.051 --> 01:28:26.884
<v Speaker 5>we've created around it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but if you could somehow remove the </v>

1957
01:28:29.681 --> 01:28:33.130
<v Speaker 5>language and just what is the intention </v>
<v Speaker 5>behind.</v>

1958
01:28:33.131 --> 01:28:35.680
<v Speaker 5>I love you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What's the intention behind?</v>

1959
01:28:35.950 --> 01:28:39.610
<v Speaker 5>I would like to paint something </v>
<v Speaker 5>beautiful like what is it outside of the</v>

1960
01:28:39.611 --> 01:28:42.970
<v Speaker 5>words you would use to describe it in a </v>
<v Speaker 5>sentence.</v>

1961
01:28:44.440 --> 01:28:45.273
<v Speaker 5>If they could figure out some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe icon based or some geometric </v>

1962
01:28:49.451 --> 01:28:52.750
<v Speaker 5>pattern based language.</v>
<v Speaker 5>New Language you can express.</v>

1963
01:28:52.751 --> 01:28:53.584
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and we would have to learn that </v>

1964
01:28:54.851 --> 01:28:55.720
<v Speaker 5>language,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1965
01:28:55.930 --> 01:29:00.550
<v Speaker 5>But it would be an intention based </v>
<v Speaker 5>language where wouldn't matter what your</v>

1966
01:29:00.551 --> 01:29:02.220
<v Speaker 5>language,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whether you speak German</v>

1967
01:29:02.220 --> 01:29:04.680
<v Speaker 4>or French.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a little like minority report.</v>

1968
01:29:04.710 --> 01:29:05.543
<v Speaker 4>Then they will take take that you had </v>
<v Speaker 4>this intention to kill someone and they </v>

1969
01:29:08.431 --> 01:29:10.350
<v Speaker 4>come and arrest you before it happens.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1970
01:29:10.351 --> 01:29:12.630
<v Speaker 4>I just feel like everything that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>happening in the brain,</v>

1971
01:29:12.690 --> 01:29:13.523
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's all trapped in the brain and then </v>

1972
01:29:15.031 --> 01:29:15.864
<v Speaker 4>gets expressed through either the </v>
<v Speaker 4>fingers or through the mouth right now </v>

1973
01:29:19.590 --> 01:29:21.720
<v Speaker 4>through the body,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's all.</v>

1974
01:29:21.750 --> 01:29:22.583
<v Speaker 4>These are all these ideas are rolling </v>
<v Speaker 4>around inside the body and then then </v>

1975
01:29:26.671 --> 01:29:28.510
<v Speaker 4>they get expressed through something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1976
01:29:28.590 --> 01:29:31.380
<v Speaker 4>What if there's a way to get right to </v>
<v Speaker 4>them?</v>

1977
01:29:31.650 --> 01:29:35.250
<v Speaker 4>You where you don't need the book.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't need to do the double birds,</v>

1978
01:29:35.300 --> 01:29:36.050
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't.</v>

1979
01:29:36.050 --> 01:29:36.883
<v Speaker 4>You know you can.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could express that through the </v>

1980
01:29:40.771 --> 01:29:44.310
<v Speaker 4>actual things that are going on in </v>
<v Speaker 4>between your ears.</v>

1981
01:29:45.120 --> 01:29:47.040
<v Speaker 4>Still Change.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Standup for sure.</v>

1982
01:29:47.110 --> 01:29:48.390
<v Speaker 4>It will be for us.</v>

1983
01:29:50.440 --> 01:29:51.273
<v Speaker 4>Walk out onstage that guys hilarious and</v>
<v Speaker 4>will be like blockbuster video of art </v>

1984
01:29:56.371 --> 01:30:00.390
<v Speaker 4>forms.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People will still want songs.</v>

1985
01:30:00.450 --> 01:30:03.600
<v Speaker 4>Songs will always be cool when you can </v>
<v Speaker 4>read minds.</v>

1986
01:30:03.601 --> 01:30:05.310
<v Speaker 4>No one wants to hear your stupid joke.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1987
01:30:05.311 --> 01:30:08.340
<v Speaker 4>you're stupid jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1988
01:30:08.460 --> 01:30:10.170
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if a.</v>

1989
01:30:10.330 --> 01:30:12.360
<v Speaker 4>sounds like that's a total stoner </v>
<v Speaker 4>science,</v>

1990
01:30:12.361 --> 01:30:12.760
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1991
01:30:12.760 --> 01:30:13.593
<v Speaker 4>That's definitely a long way off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now there's someone right now writing </v>

1992
01:30:15.541 --> 01:30:19.200
<v Speaker 4>this down because this dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's got a spectrum,</v>

1993
01:30:20.130 --> 01:30:22.030
<v Speaker 4>but I can do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's um,</v>

1994
01:30:22.080 --> 01:30:26.220
<v Speaker 4>he's ambitious and he's got an idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can make it true.</v>

1995
01:30:26.350 --> 01:30:29.190
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you have those htc vive headsets on,</v>

1996
01:30:29.191 --> 01:30:32.130
<v Speaker 4>have you ever put those things on you?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jesus Christ,</v>

1997
01:30:32.131 --> 01:30:35.070
<v Speaker 4>they're a game changer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you mean the virtual reality stuff?</v>

1998
01:30:35.071 --> 01:30:35.550
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

2000
01:30:36.151 --> 01:30:39.200
<v Speaker 4>There's a couple different ones.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now there's a rift.</v>

2001
01:30:39.260 --> 01:30:40.500
<v Speaker 4>I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know the Samsung,</v>

2002
01:30:40.520 --> 01:30:42.270
<v Speaker 4>but the HTC is one.</v>

2003
01:30:42.780 --> 01:30:45.030
<v Speaker 4>Samsung has one that you slide right </v>
<v Speaker 4>into your,</v>

2004
01:30:45.031 --> 01:30:46.290
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a phone,</v>

2005
01:30:46.291 --> 01:30:47.550
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can sign a phone to do it.</v>

2006
01:30:47.900 --> 01:30:49.710
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you said your phone into the thing?</v>

2007
01:30:49.770 --> 01:30:50.780
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have like a dog,</v>

2008
01:30:50.790 --> 01:30:53.130
<v Speaker 4>like the Google Pixel.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that too?</v>

2009
01:30:53.150 --> 01:30:55.350
<v Speaker 4>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2010
01:30:55.380 --> 01:30:56.610
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you slide it in.</v>

2011
01:30:56.640 --> 01:30:58.740
<v Speaker 4>I did that with the New York Times.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hadn't one.</v>

2012
01:30:58.741 --> 01:30:59.574
<v Speaker 4>They sent like a cardboard one and slide</v>
<v Speaker 4>it in and all of a sudden you're with </v>

2013
01:31:03.001 --> 01:31:05.640
<v Speaker 4>the refugees in Syria walking down the </v>
<v Speaker 4>street.</v>

2014
01:31:06.030 --> 01:31:08.520
<v Speaker 4>You're looking around you and there's </v>
<v Speaker 4>people behind you and in front of you.</v>

2015
01:31:08.610 --> 01:31:09.720
<v Speaker 4>Fucking bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2016
01:31:09.721 --> 01:31:11.430
<v Speaker 4>It looks pretty intense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2017
01:31:11.431 --> 01:31:12.264
<v Speaker 4>they can do that now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like the processing power of phones is </v>

2018
01:31:14.371 --> 01:31:16.410
<v Speaker 4>pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The crazy thing is like you could take a</v>

2019
01:31:16.411 --> 01:31:19.350
<v Speaker 4>regular smart phone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not bad,</v>

2020
01:31:19.740 --> 01:31:24.740
<v Speaker 4>but it's not as good as like the the </v>
<v Speaker 4>high end ones and we're in an infancy of</v>

2021
01:31:24.901 --> 01:31:25.380
<v Speaker 4>this stuff.</v>

2022
01:31:25.380 --> 01:31:27.480
<v Speaker 4>Most people don't even know what it is </v>
<v Speaker 4>when you bring it up.</v>

2023
01:31:27.600 --> 01:31:30.120
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's coming to Dunkin has one.</v>

2024
01:31:30.121 --> 01:31:30.954
<v Speaker 4>When you're in this underwater </v>
<v Speaker 4>environment in a whale comes up to say </v>

2025
01:31:33.001 --> 01:31:34.650
<v Speaker 4>hi to you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you're like,</v>

2026
01:31:34.651 --> 01:31:38.250
<v Speaker 4>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fuck in front of me.</v>

2027
01:31:38.400 --> 01:31:40.140
<v Speaker 4>You're like looking at the whales.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I.</v>

2028
01:31:40.141 --> 01:31:40.861
<v Speaker 4>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2029
01:31:40.861 --> 01:31:41.694
<v Speaker 4>this is so weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because you really feel like you're at </v>

2030
01:31:44.041 --> 01:31:46.770
<v Speaker 4>the bottom of the ocean and these things</v>
<v Speaker 4>swim overhead.</v>

2031
01:31:46.771 --> 01:31:48.600
<v Speaker 4>You watched them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Holy Cow.</v>

2032
01:31:48.660 --> 01:31:50.580
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a mind fuck.</v>

2033
01:31:50.610 --> 01:31:51.443
<v Speaker 4>So you could walk in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sit in the sit in the chair and watch a </v>

2034
01:31:53.431 --> 01:31:57.600
<v Speaker 4>standup show you one special,</v>
<v Speaker 4>100 percent.</v>

2035
01:31:57.680 --> 01:32:01.120
<v Speaker 4>Next aspect of doing your special would </v>
<v Speaker 4>be releasing it that way.</v>

2036
01:32:02.230 --> 01:32:04.870
<v Speaker 4>Great idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is Kevin Hart's already done it.</v>

2037
01:32:04.900 --> 01:32:05.733
<v Speaker 4>He's probably,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's done it in a football field with a </v>

2038
01:32:08.081 --> 01:32:11.640
<v Speaker 4>jet pack with a whale.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Comes through the middle.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I think that's Kat.</v>

2059
01:33:04.930 --> 01:33:08.620
<v Speaker 4>Kat Williams is getting into God Damn </v>
<v Speaker 4>Street fight with a young kid.</v>

2060
01:33:09.670 --> 01:33:12.010
<v Speaker 4>That was hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He sucker punched the kid.</v>

2061
01:33:12.490 --> 01:33:13.323
<v Speaker 4>Something tells me cats not sitting down</v>
<v Speaker 4>with that notebook every morning like I </v>

2062
01:33:16.690 --> 01:33:17.980
<v Speaker 4>have to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe.</v>

2063
01:33:18.100 --> 01:33:18.933
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he seems like one of those guys that </v>

2064
01:33:19.691 --> 01:33:24.691
<v Speaker 4>just flies feel like he also,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like maybe I think he's a little smarter</v>

2065
01:33:25.211 --> 01:33:26.044
<v Speaker 4>than people give them credit for and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>think it's entirely possible that he </v>

2066
01:33:28.691 --> 01:33:29.524
<v Speaker 4>might in some sort of a weird,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether it's conscious or subconscious </v>

2067
01:33:31.961 --> 01:33:34.480
<v Speaker 4>way put himself in these horrible </v>
<v Speaker 4>situations.</v>

2068
01:33:34.481 --> 01:33:37.990
<v Speaker 4>So he has funny shit to talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

2069
01:33:37.991 --> 01:33:40.490
<v Speaker 4>My instinct is he just ends up in those </v>
<v Speaker 4>things and that.</v>

2070
01:33:40.491 --> 01:33:42.380
<v Speaker 4>So that's the beauty that comes out the </v>
<v Speaker 4>end.</v>

2071
01:33:42.880 --> 01:33:45.700
<v Speaker 4>You might be right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I don't think he's as calculated.</v>

2072
01:33:45.850 --> 01:33:47.410
<v Speaker 4>You might be right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It might be.</v>

2073
01:33:47.440 --> 01:33:49.210
<v Speaker 4>It might be a little bit of both things.</v>

2074
01:33:49.240 --> 01:33:50.940
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the thing is,</v>

2075
01:33:50.950 --> 01:33:52.360
<v Speaker 4>he's very smart,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

2076
01:33:53.530 --> 01:33:55.270
<v Speaker 4>You can't be that funny and not be </v>
<v Speaker 4>smart.</v>

2077
01:33:55.480 --> 01:33:56.140
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2078
01:33:56.140 --> 01:33:58.120
<v Speaker 4>said something that I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

2079
01:33:58.150 --> 01:34:00.310
<v Speaker 4>oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I was listening to this video,</v>

2080
01:34:00.311 --> 01:34:04.450
<v Speaker 4>it was him in the backseat of a limo and</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's drunk driving around.</v>

2081
01:34:04.540 --> 01:34:05.373
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was talking about before he goes </v>

2082
01:34:06.701 --> 01:34:10.000
<v Speaker 4>on stage and one of the things that he </v>
<v Speaker 4>said was that he doesn't eat anything,</v>

2083
01:34:10.790 --> 01:34:11.740
<v Speaker 4>don't eat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>

2084
01:34:11.890 --> 01:34:14.380
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wanna I don't want to be full when I'm</v>

2085
01:34:14.381 --> 01:34:16.000
<v Speaker 4>onstage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to feel like that.</v>

2086
01:34:16.030 --> 01:34:18.460
<v Speaker 4>You like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you want to eat better off being hungry.</v>

2087
01:34:19.010 --> 01:34:20.680
<v Speaker 4>Like you don't want to be slowed down by</v>
<v Speaker 4>food.</v>

2088
01:34:20.681 --> 01:34:21.950
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a great idea.</v>

2089
01:34:22.020 --> 01:34:23.140
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know that.</v>

2090
01:34:23.200 --> 01:34:25.510
<v Speaker 4>But yet I would still violate that if I </v>
<v Speaker 4>was hungry.</v>

2091
01:34:26.670 --> 01:34:29.200
<v Speaker 4>Like I'd rather like if I had a show at </v>
<v Speaker 4>8:00</v>

2092
01:34:29.201 --> 01:34:32.150
<v Speaker 4>and I was kind of hungry at seven,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll eat a fucking cheeseburger.</v>

2093
01:34:32.180 --> 01:34:33.013
<v Speaker 4>You would?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2094
01:34:33.190 --> 01:34:34.023
<v Speaker 4>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to drink a milkshake really </v>

2095
01:34:36.700 --> 01:34:39.700
<v Speaker 4>for the longest time I would just eat </v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever the fuck I wanted to daily.</v>

2096
01:34:39.760 --> 01:34:40.593
<v Speaker 4>I could never do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But then I watched that Kat Williams </v>

2097
01:34:42.641 --> 01:34:43.660
<v Speaker 4>thing and I went,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what?</v>

2098
01:34:43.661 --> 01:34:44.494
<v Speaker 4>He's right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You really shouldn't eat before you go </v>

2099
01:34:46.331 --> 01:34:47.164
<v Speaker 4>on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you can always have like a little </v>

2100
01:34:48.461 --> 01:34:51.070
<v Speaker 4>bit in between chose.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But when you have a meal,</v>

2101
01:34:51.370 --> 01:34:54.490
<v Speaker 4>you go down enough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You just slow down a little bit.</v>

2102
01:34:54.520 --> 01:34:55.061
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2103
01:34:55.061 --> 01:34:58.190
<v Speaker 4>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You might be able to power now if</v>

2104
01:34:58.190 --> 01:34:59.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I'm in trouble.</v>

2105
01:34:59.530 --> 01:35:01.530
<v Speaker 1>The hardest part about being on the road</v>
<v Speaker 1>is windy.</v>

2106
01:35:01.550 --> 01:35:02.383
<v Speaker 1>You eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really feel like the timing of when </v>

2107
01:35:03.921 --> 01:35:06.230
<v Speaker 1>you eat and when you're going to perform</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all that stuff.</v>

2108
01:35:06.590 --> 01:35:07.423
<v Speaker 1>So if I get past the 4:00,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if I eat like late early in the </v>

2109
01:35:11.510 --> 01:35:13.460
<v Speaker 1>afternoon and then getting too close to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the show,</v>

2110
01:35:13.790 --> 01:35:14.623
<v Speaker 1>it's not enough for a meal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I'll try and a protein bar at to </v>

2111
01:35:17.451 --> 01:35:19.830
<v Speaker 1>get me through the show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something light that's,</v>

2112
01:35:19.880 --> 01:35:21.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to be up there digesting.</v>

2113
01:35:22.250 --> 01:35:23.083
<v Speaker 1>I remember Jim Carrey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was in some interview the guy who </v>

2114
01:35:26.570 --> 01:35:27.403
<v Speaker 1>directed him in like ace Ventura or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something and they said get all of this </v>

2115
01:35:29.721 --> 01:35:32.420
<v Speaker 1>stuff before lunch because once he eats </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a different guy.</v>

2116
01:35:32.421 --> 01:35:33.254
<v Speaker 1>Like that hyper hilarious Jim Carey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to get that in the morning </v>

2117
01:35:36.531 --> 01:35:38.480
<v Speaker 1>because once he starts eating it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>different guy.</v>

2118
01:35:38.900 --> 01:35:40.190
<v Speaker 1>No Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2119
01:35:40.820 --> 01:35:41.810
<v Speaker 1>it makes sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2120
01:35:41.811 --> 01:35:43.100
<v Speaker 1>I mean you get like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2121
01:35:43.101 --> 01:35:44.720
<v Speaker 1>I just want to nap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2122
01:35:44.721 --> 01:35:47.120
<v Speaker 1>You can't be like ace ventura,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pet detective,</v>

2123
01:35:47.690 --> 01:35:49.790
<v Speaker 1>you can't be pulling your ass cheeks </v>
<v Speaker 1>apart.</v>

2124
01:35:49.880 --> 01:35:53.510
<v Speaker 1>When you think about how over the top </v>
<v Speaker 1>that fucking movie was,</v>

2125
01:35:53.540 --> 01:35:54.373
<v Speaker 1>he was so over the top,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he took over the top to a new </v>

2126
01:35:58.071 --> 01:35:59.750
<v Speaker 1>place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a whole nother place.</v>

2127
01:35:59.810 --> 01:36:01.100
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like people who would say like,</v>

2128
01:36:01.101 --> 01:36:01.934
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like physical comedy doesn't really </v>

2129
01:36:02.871 --> 01:36:05.270
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like maybe if you have asset.</v>

2130
01:36:05.450 --> 01:36:06.283
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you go balls out like that guy </v>

<v Speaker 1>you tell me.</v>

2132
01:36:08.661 --> 01:36:12.860
<v Speaker 1>That's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like pet detective till to this day.</v>

2133
01:36:12.861 --> 01:36:14.780
<v Speaker 1>I'll watch that and it's fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>hilarious.</v>

2134
01:36:14.810 --> 01:36:15.643
<v Speaker 1>Just hiking his pants up is hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Observed human beings just get the </v>

2135
01:36:20.770 --> 01:36:21.603
<v Speaker 1>camera,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get the camera on this guy with his </v>

2136
01:36:23.901 --> 01:36:26.130
<v Speaker 1>facial expressions and running around </v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

2137
01:36:26.150 --> 01:36:29.030
<v Speaker 1>Created this incredibly bizarre </v>
<v Speaker 1>character.</v>

2138
01:36:29.030 --> 01:36:32.130
<v Speaker 1>Like what the fuck am I watching?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it was so over the top.</v>

2139
01:36:32.170 --> 01:36:34.310
<v Speaker 1>So funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's hilarious.</v>

2140
01:36:34.520 --> 01:36:35.660
<v Speaker 1>When I was in high school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>

2141
01:36:35.900 --> 01:36:38.440
<v Speaker 1>I would imitate him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His invitations.</v>

2142
01:36:38.480 --> 01:36:39.313
<v Speaker 1>Remember when he did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had that set where he was doing like </v>

2143
01:36:40.641 --> 01:36:42.770
<v Speaker 1>on golden pond.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>

2144
01:36:42.771 --> 01:36:45.170
<v Speaker 1>strawberries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>strawberries.</v>

2145
01:36:45.171 --> 01:36:46.890
<v Speaker 1>He did the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole golden pond.</v>

2146
01:36:46.891 --> 01:36:49.010
<v Speaker 1>He did all these great impressions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

2147
01:36:49.050 --> 01:36:51.110
<v Speaker 1>You can do a lot of impressions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how I would,</v>

2148
01:36:51.111 --> 01:36:52.880
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>try and impress girls.</v>

2149
01:36:52.881 --> 01:36:55.460
<v Speaker 1>Doing his impressions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2150
01:36:55.461 --> 01:36:59.150
<v Speaker 1>He's a fucking super talented guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2151
01:36:59.450 --> 01:37:01.550
<v Speaker 1>Really talented.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just the energy,</v>

2152
01:37:01.551 --> 01:37:02.384
<v Speaker 1>the pure energy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he changed his act break with </v>

2153
01:37:03.861 --> 01:37:05.810
<v Speaker 1>Rodney.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he was opening for Ronnie and he</v>

2154
01:37:05.811 --> 01:37:06.644
<v Speaker 1>was doing kind of straight standup and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then said he wanted to go this new </v>

2155
01:37:08.961 --> 01:37:09.794
<v Speaker 1>direction and start doing these </v>
<v Speaker 1>characters and voices and impressions </v>

2156
01:37:13.280 --> 01:37:15.890
<v Speaker 1>and Rodney kind of encouraged them to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to go for it.</v>

2157
01:37:15.890 --> 01:37:17.690
<v Speaker 1>Like you can buy them on my show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't care.</v>

2158
01:37:18.590 --> 01:37:20.510
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could bomb.</v>

2159
01:37:20.511 --> 01:37:22.790
<v Speaker 1>I don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get out there.</v>

2160
01:37:23.210 --> 01:37:25.010
<v Speaker 1>He's a bad motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2161
01:37:25.040 --> 01:37:25.873
<v Speaker 1>That was a painter who was on a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was on a movie set once and a friend </v>

2162
01:37:30.051 --> 01:37:33.290
<v Speaker 1>of mine was working on the set and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't like his performance on the take.</v>

2163
01:37:33.740 --> 01:37:34.740
<v Speaker 1>He was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck.</v>

2164
01:37:34.910 --> 01:37:35.743
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he didn't,</v>

2165
01:37:36.170 --> 01:37:38.300
<v Speaker 1>didn't feel like it was up to his </v>
<v Speaker 1>standards or something like that.</v>

2166
01:37:38.301 --> 01:37:40.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So to burn off energy,</v>

2167
01:37:40.490 --> 01:37:44.060
<v Speaker 1>he just smashed his fucking car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a car that was there,</v>

2168
01:37:44.061 --> 01:37:48.800
<v Speaker 1>like one of the production drawers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just smashed it with a bat.</v>

2169
01:37:48.830 --> 01:37:50.840
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember what he hit it with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember what they said.</v>

2170
01:37:50.841 --> 01:37:54.200
<v Speaker 1>He picked something up and started </v>
<v Speaker 1>whacking this fucking car and you know,</v>

2171
01:37:54.440 --> 01:37:56.190
<v Speaker 1>this is Jim Carrey when it's at the top</v>

2172
01:37:56.190 --> 01:37:57.540
<v Speaker 4>of the heap.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2173
01:37:58.090 --> 01:37:59.560
<v Speaker 4>just let him wreck the car.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Will just.</v>

2174
01:38:00.150 --> 01:38:01.130
<v Speaker 4>He doesn't get.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's just,</v>

2175
01:38:01.200 --> 01:38:04.790
<v Speaker 4>he just wanted to get some energy out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fucking fucking fucking.</v>

2176
01:38:05.170 --> 01:38:07.010
<v Speaker 4>Just smashed fast.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fast.</v>

2177
01:38:07.280 --> 01:38:08.220
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All right.</v>

2178
01:38:08.221 --> 01:38:09.054
<v Speaker 4>We're back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then he went and did the sea that </v>

2179
01:38:10.081 --> 01:38:11.160
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Holy Shit.</v>

2180
01:38:11.161 --> 01:38:13.290
<v Speaker 4>That must have been hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's great.</v>

2181
01:38:13.560 --> 01:38:17.230
<v Speaker 4>Do you sometimes think that maybe you </v>
<v Speaker 4>should be crazier as a,</v>

2182
01:38:17.610 --> 01:38:19.260
<v Speaker 4>as as a comedian?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>

2183
01:38:19.261 --> 01:38:21.060
<v Speaker 4>I know that feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know exactly what you're saying.</v>

2184
01:38:21.090 --> 01:38:23.340
<v Speaker 4>I know where you're going with that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if you were crazy,</v>

2185
01:38:23.341 --> 01:38:24.720
<v Speaker 4>you'd be funnier.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2186
01:38:24.721 --> 01:38:28.380
<v Speaker 4>Like if completely reckless,</v>
<v Speaker 4>crazy person.</v>

2187
01:38:28.890 --> 01:38:31.540
<v Speaker 4>If you were more cat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2188
01:38:31.590 --> 01:38:34.320
<v Speaker 4>Like I always hear the bit like he </v>
<v Speaker 4>always hear like the stories,</v>

2189
01:38:34.321 --> 01:38:36.210
<v Speaker 4>like they had to get the guy to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>show,</v>

2190
01:38:38.280 --> 01:38:39.113
<v Speaker 4>get the guy to the show.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Was there a half hour early going </v>

2191
01:38:41.491 --> 01:38:42.510
<v Speaker 4>through my notes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

2192
01:38:43.200 --> 01:38:44.033
<v Speaker 4>I'm a square.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know when I was young I did meditate </v>

2193
01:38:46.501 --> 01:38:47.334
<v Speaker 4>on purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I stopped meditating for a long time </v>

2194
01:38:49.380 --> 01:38:52.020
<v Speaker 4>because I literally thought like when I </v>
<v Speaker 4>was 21,</v>

2195
01:38:52.060 --> 01:38:54.090
<v Speaker 4>22 fucking sucked.</v>

2196
01:38:56.100 --> 01:38:57.390
<v Speaker 4>I sucked.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2197
01:38:57.470 --> 01:38:59.470
<v Speaker 4>it just wasn't very good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We never.</v>

2198
01:38:59.610 --> 01:39:00.730
<v Speaker 4>But we got energy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2199
01:39:00.930 --> 01:39:04.130
<v Speaker 4>But I thought at the time that if I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2200
01:39:04.470 --> 01:39:08.790
<v Speaker 4>if I was moving toward enlightenment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like if I was meditating,</v>

2201
01:39:08.791 --> 01:39:11.520
<v Speaker 4>the reason why I was meditating,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like when I was competing,</v>

2202
01:39:12.120 --> 01:39:12.953
<v Speaker 4>I would meditate because it would try,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would try to move towards a place of </v>

2203
01:39:16.290 --> 01:39:18.780
<v Speaker 4>like balance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But then as a comedian I was like,</v>

2204
01:39:18.781 --> 01:39:19.614
<v Speaker 4>you probably shouldn't be balanced </v>
<v Speaker 4>because the funny shit comes from the </v>

2205
01:39:23.071 --> 01:39:23.904
<v Speaker 4>people like Richard Pryor,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these problems and it's kind of crazy </v>

2206
01:39:27.121 --> 01:39:31.680
<v Speaker 4>and innocent and it was just crazy and </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing all those are my heroes.</v>

2207
01:39:31.681 --> 01:39:32.760
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>

2208
01:39:32.880 --> 01:39:35.700
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're also not here anymore.</v>

2209
01:39:36.360 --> 01:39:37.380
<v Speaker 4>Same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2210
01:39:37.590 --> 01:39:38.520
<v Speaker 4>Same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

2211
01:39:38.580 --> 01:39:39.660
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is great.</v>

2212
01:39:39.661 --> 01:39:41.160
<v Speaker 4>People that are still around.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fuck.</v>

2213
01:39:41.161 --> 01:39:42.570
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think the best guys.</v>

2214
01:39:42.630 --> 01:39:43.463
<v Speaker 4>I really do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think right now between bill burr and </v>

<v Speaker 3>traditional kind of like a kinda like a </v>

2247

2250
01:41:11.930 --> 01:41:16.120
<v Speaker 3>And he brought it over to my house after</v>
<v Speaker 3>a set at the store and dropped it off.</v>

2251
01:41:16.150 --> 01:41:16.983
<v Speaker 3>It was a little raw inside.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had a problem with is up and it </v>

2252
01:41:18.461 --> 01:41:19.720
<v Speaker 3>wasn't a big deal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he knows how to bake.</v>

2257
01:41:28.661 --> 01:41:31.750
<v Speaker 3>except that he was a little pissed off </v>
<v Speaker 3>that his wife liked my bread so much.</v>

2258
01:41:31.990 --> 01:41:34.130
<v Speaker 3>Just a feeling of expertise</v>

2259
01:41:34.490 --> 01:41:37.640
<v Speaker 5>perhaps when you know they really know </v>
<v Speaker 5>something you use.</v>

2260
01:41:37.641 --> 01:41:40.160
<v Speaker 5>Talk about bread,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like you just took on right there.</v>

2261
01:41:40.161 --> 01:41:41.480

2262
01:41:41.940 --> 01:41:42.773
<v Speaker 3>bad?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you have an air of expertise when </v>

2263
01:41:45.921 --> 01:41:48.320
<v Speaker 3>it comes to the area of bread?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2264
01:41:48.890 --> 01:41:50.490
<v Speaker 3>I'm in deep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a deep.</v>

2265
01:41:51.110 --> 01:41:53.830
<v Speaker 3>I islet when I see you talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2266
01:41:53.930 --> 01:41:56.510
<v Speaker 3>doing your bow and Arrow thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what bread is for me.</v>

2267
01:41:57.050 --> 01:42:01.940
<v Speaker 3>It's this meditative small thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>small moves to try and get better.</v>

2268
01:42:02.360 --> 01:42:05.380
<v Speaker 3>I'm completely,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the rest of the world is out there and I</v>

2269
01:42:05.381 --> 01:42:08.060
<v Speaker 3>am in here working on this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>figuring this</v>

2270
01:42:08.580 --> 01:42:11.160
<v Speaker 5>mystery out when it comes to like Bono </v>
<v Speaker 5>stuff.</v>

2271
01:42:11.161 --> 01:42:14.220
<v Speaker 5>I'm like a good blue belt.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

2272
01:42:14.280 --> 01:42:17.280
<v Speaker 5>But I'm not very.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's bankers.</v>

2273
01:42:17.281 --> 01:42:18.970
<v Speaker 5>They're run circles around me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but yeah,</v>

2274
01:42:19.080 --> 01:42:21.500
<v Speaker 5>but you're in it just as much as that </v>
<v Speaker 5>guy is.</v>

2275
01:42:21.540 --> 01:42:23.460
<v Speaker 5>What's amazing about the bone Arrow </v>
<v Speaker 5>world,</v>

2276
01:42:23.490 --> 01:42:27.240
<v Speaker 5>I would say the archery world is how </v>
<v Speaker 5>much there is to know,</v>

2277
01:42:27.420 --> 01:42:29.640
<v Speaker 5>like you would never believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's endless,</v>

2278
01:42:30.020 --> 01:42:31.500
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You would look at it and you go,</v>

2279
01:42:31.501 --> 01:42:32.520
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you pull the string back,</v>

2280
01:42:32.521 --> 01:42:33.750
<v Speaker 5>you aim,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you let the Arrow go.</v>

2281
01:42:34.100 --> 01:42:35.640
<v Speaker 5>And a lot of people that is what they </v>
<v Speaker 5>think.</v>

2282
01:42:35.641 --> 01:42:37.850
<v Speaker 5>That is what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But then you get into it and you,</v>

2283
01:42:37.880 --> 01:42:40.500
<v Speaker 5>you understand like the physics behind </v>
<v Speaker 5>these things,</v>

2284
01:42:40.501 --> 01:42:45.501
<v Speaker 5>the cams and the fucking limbs that pull</v>
<v Speaker 5>back on these compound bows and how it's</v>

2285
01:42:46.951 --> 01:42:47.784
<v Speaker 5>all measured and weighed and balanced </v>
<v Speaker 5>and hoyt has to come out with a brand </v>

2286
01:42:52.051 --> 01:42:54.840
<v Speaker 5>new better bow every year and you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>crazy.</v>

2287
01:42:55.080 --> 01:42:59.490
<v Speaker 5>These minor improvements of engineering,</v>
<v Speaker 5>these things are getting faster and more</v>

2288
01:42:59.491 --> 01:43:04.491
<v Speaker 5>powerful and it's all about figuring out</v>
<v Speaker 5>how to get a executed shot correctly.</v>

2289
01:43:05.281 --> 01:43:06.114
<v Speaker 5>Using your skeleton and holding </v>
<v Speaker 5>everything perfect and having any </v>

2290
01:43:09.661 --> 01:43:12.240
<v Speaker 5>influence on the flight of the Arrow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like it's maddening.</v>

2291
01:43:12.620 --> 01:43:16.290
<v Speaker 5>It would take you for a lifetime to </v>
<v Speaker 5>master it and would you,</v>

2292
01:43:16.500 --> 01:43:17.880
<v Speaker 5>could you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You could.</v>

2293
01:43:18.180 --> 01:43:19.013
<v Speaker 5>Could you imagine you got into it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think if there's nothing physically </v>

2294
01:43:21.841 --> 01:43:22.674
<v Speaker 5>wrong with you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think bow and Arrow shooting archery </v>

2295
01:43:26.641 --> 01:43:31.641
<v Speaker 5>is one of the more easy things on your </v>
<v Speaker 5>body.</v>

2296
01:43:32.190 --> 01:43:33.023
<v Speaker 5>Like in terms of like you could be </v>
<v Speaker 5>really good at it deep in your forties </v>

2297
01:43:35.611 --> 01:43:36.900
<v Speaker 5>or fifties.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

2298
01:43:36.901 --> 01:43:37.734
<v Speaker 5>it's what I love about the reason I ask </v>
<v Speaker 5>is the thing I love about this bread </v>

2299
01:43:41.491 --> 01:43:42.960
<v Speaker 5>thing where you're talking about with </v>
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

2300
01:43:42.961 --> 01:43:45.150
<v Speaker 5>with standup,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's</v>

2301
01:43:45.770 --> 01:43:48.110
<v Speaker 3>kind of unknowable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can get great at it,</v>

2302
01:43:48.111 --> 01:43:48.944
<v Speaker 3>you can be a master,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can be one of the people that </v>

2303
01:43:49.881 --> 01:43:52.430
<v Speaker 3>everyone looks at and says he's one of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the guys</v>

2304
01:43:53.240 --> 01:43:55.010
<v Speaker 1>and still it could be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2305
01:43:55.011 --> 01:43:58.970
<v Speaker 1>that night or that moment or that pull </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's out of your reach.</v>

2306
01:43:59.030 --> 01:44:00.310
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2307
01:44:00.320 --> 01:44:04.070
<v Speaker 1>I love that idea that you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you know,</v>

2308
01:44:04.071 --> 01:44:06.050
<v Speaker 1>you have something you can work on for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the rest of your life.</v>

2309
01:44:06.100 --> 01:44:08.120
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

2310
01:44:08.480 --> 01:44:09.313
<v Speaker 1>I'll get calls from seinfeld telling me </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's completely lost with what he's </v>

2311
01:44:12.621 --> 01:44:15.230
<v Speaker 1>doing with this set.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

2312
01:44:15.370 --> 01:44:19.820
<v Speaker 1>That's to me is comforting because </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what a craft is.</v>

2313
01:44:19.821 --> 01:44:22.250
<v Speaker 1>It's like I can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can get really great.</v>

2314
01:44:22.251 --> 01:44:24.410
<v Speaker 1>I can work so hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get really,</v>

2315
01:44:24.411 --> 01:44:25.550
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really great.</v>

2316
01:44:25.760 --> 01:44:27.890
<v Speaker 1>And then have a night where you're just </v>
<v Speaker 1>off.</v>

2317
01:44:28.530 --> 01:44:29.363
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's really no other way that you </v>

2318
01:44:31.101 --> 01:44:31.940
<v Speaker 1>can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2319
01:44:32.750 --> 01:44:37.390
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like for a guy like Seinfeld that's</v>

2320
01:44:37.391 --> 01:44:42.391
<v Speaker 1>so successful and is made so many </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking standup specials,</v>

2321
01:44:42.561 --> 01:44:43.820
<v Speaker 1>how many specialists does he have?</v>

2322
01:44:43.940 --> 01:44:45.830
<v Speaker 1>Not that many.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually.</v>

2323
01:44:45.860 --> 01:44:48.410
<v Speaker 1>He's actually at least three.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2324
01:44:48.580 --> 01:44:49.370
<v Speaker 1>four.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2325
01:44:49.370 --> 01:44:51.080
<v Speaker 1>three.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably three big ones.</v>

2326
01:44:51.320 --> 01:44:53.810
<v Speaker 1>So he's at least put thousands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2327
01:44:54.110 --> 01:44:55.570
<v Speaker 1>so many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2328
01:44:56.900 --> 01:44:58.220
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>late night performances.</v>

2329
01:44:58.250 --> 01:44:59.630
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2330
01:44:59.750 --> 01:45:00.770
<v Speaker 1>that's right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

2331
01:45:00.800 --> 01:45:02.510
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like several,</v>

2332
01:45:02.511 --> 01:45:03.344
<v Speaker 1>a year for 40 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then in between that you put in the </v>

2333
01:45:07.971 --> 01:45:08.804
<v Speaker 1>show Seinfeld,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which probably took almost all of his </v>

2334
01:45:11.811 --> 01:45:12.644
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he wasn't doing that much standup </v>

2335
01:45:13.610 --> 01:45:16.790
<v Speaker 1>while he was doing that in the summers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He would go tour in the summer,</v>

2336
01:45:16.850 --> 01:45:21.780
<v Speaker 1>but because that's a brutal Gig,</v>
<v Speaker 1>putting together a giant hit sitcom like</v>

2337
01:45:21.790 --> 01:45:23.630
<v Speaker 1>Seinfeld,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that must've been a brutal gig.</v>

2338
01:45:23.631 --> 01:45:25.620
<v Speaker 1>He talks about it like he went to war or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

2339
01:45:28.640 --> 01:45:32.690
<v Speaker 1>But the point is that guy that he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he has to still go through the same</v>

2340
01:45:32.691 --> 01:45:34.730
<v Speaker 1>process,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same exact.</v>

2341
01:45:35.390 --> 01:45:36.223
<v Speaker 1>I just talked to him this morning and </v>
<v Speaker 1>all we talked about was how are you </v>

2342
01:45:38.661 --> 01:45:39.650
<v Speaker 1>writing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you writing?</v>

2343
01:45:39.651 --> 01:45:40.850
<v Speaker 1>What are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>When are you writing?</v>

2344
01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:42.410
<v Speaker 1>Are you writing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're doing it late,</v>

2345
01:45:42.411 --> 01:45:43.244
<v Speaker 1>you're doing it early.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doing it here and I'm trying to get it </v>

2346
01:45:45.111 --> 01:45:47.410
<v Speaker 1>in an hour here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if I sit and it was just an.</v>

2347
01:45:47.630 --> 01:45:51.140
<v Speaker 1>All that stuff was still 40 years in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's awesome.</v>

2348
01:45:51.200 --> 01:45:52.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the best.</v>

2349
01:45:52.191 --> 01:45:55.070
<v Speaker 1>That's what all that stuff is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so awesome.</v>

2350
01:45:55.310 --> 01:45:56.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what the,</v>

2351
01:45:56.811 --> 01:45:57.950
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only,</v>

2352
01:45:58.010 --> 01:45:58.843
<v Speaker 1>the only advantage I would say that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bread thing has over the bow and Arrow </v>

2353
01:46:02.031 --> 01:46:04.020
<v Speaker 1>thing is I get to eat it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hm.</v>

2354
01:46:04.580 --> 01:46:06.650
<v Speaker 1>Good point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could eat elk though.</v>

2355
01:46:07.190 --> 01:46:10.080
<v Speaker 1>You can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can take a lot.</v>

2356
01:46:10.130 --> 01:46:10.963
<v Speaker 1>It takes a lot.</v>

2357
01:46:11.280 --> 01:46:12.680
<v Speaker 1>A lot of work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2358
01:46:12.770 --> 01:46:15.650
<v Speaker 1>If you want to get an elk or anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it takes a lot of work,</v>

2359
01:46:16.030 --> 01:46:18.470
<v Speaker 1>but I guess it takes a lot of work to </v>
<v Speaker 1>learn how to bake bread,</v>

2360
01:46:18.471 --> 01:46:21.320
<v Speaker 1>but it's a different kind of work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's different,</v>

2361
01:46:21.321 --> 01:46:24.470
<v Speaker 1>but there's all of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's a whole nother level that</v>

2362
01:46:24.471 --> 01:46:25.304
<v Speaker 1>I am not even sure of the Ph balance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the humidity in the house that the </v>

2363
01:46:31.220 --> 01:46:32.053
<v Speaker 1>temperature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of this stuff that's got it dialed </v>

2364
01:46:34.161 --> 01:46:34.994
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there like one bread where it's like </v>

2365
01:46:36.131 --> 01:46:36.964
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you wanted to get a bow you </v>

2366
01:46:38.901 --> 01:46:42.290
<v Speaker 1>would get a hoyt fizzer one bread that </v>
<v Speaker 1>has like a,</v>

2367
01:46:42.530 --> 01:46:44.630
<v Speaker 1>there's so many.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when I literally,</v>

2368
01:46:44.631 --> 01:46:48.140
<v Speaker 1>when I'm on the road I'll go check out </v>
<v Speaker 1>these bakeries and like just go see what</v>

2369
01:46:48.141 --> 01:46:49.410
<v Speaker 1>kind of bread they're making and see </v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

2370
01:46:49.530 --> 01:46:51.000
<v Speaker 1>who's doing what in this town.</v>

2371
01:46:51.570 --> 01:46:56.040
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a place in Venice down by a day.</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's dark.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea.</v>

2401
01:48:04.560 --> 01:48:07.020
<v Speaker 1>There it is right there.</v>

2406
01:48:15.481 --> 01:48:17.760
<v Speaker 1>So that's a piece of art.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a piece of art.</v>

2407
01:48:17.761 --> 01:48:20.040
<v Speaker 1>It's an edible piece of art like they've</v>
<v Speaker 1>crafted.</v>

2408
01:48:20.041 --> 01:48:20.874
<v Speaker 1>It's a very appealing in the outside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks very rustic and it's formed </v>

2409
01:48:24.630 --> 01:48:27.000
<v Speaker 1>like they put the little slashes in it </v>
<v Speaker 1>when they were baking it,</v>

2410
01:48:27.001 --> 01:48:28.680
<v Speaker 1>so it has layers to it.</v>

2411
01:48:28.980 --> 01:48:30.780
<v Speaker 1>I watched this girl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was in the back.</v>

2412
01:48:30.781 --> 01:48:34.950
<v Speaker 1>You could see them working and doing all</v>
<v Speaker 1>this stuff and this girl was back there.</v>

2413
01:48:34.980 --> 01:48:38.880
<v Speaker 1>She's beaten this thing of dough with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>pin.</v>

2414
01:48:39.210 --> 01:48:40.043
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe I could work here for a little </v>

2415
01:48:40.831 --> 01:48:41.664
<v Speaker 1>while.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I could just work here for like a </v>

2416
01:48:44.100 --> 01:48:47.070
<v Speaker 1>couple months and just as an apprentice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like for free.</v>

2417
01:48:47.700 --> 01:48:49.920
<v Speaker 1>Let me just figure out what the hell </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're doing.</v>

2418
01:48:50.090 --> 01:48:52.410
<v Speaker 1>It literally is to a level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what they're doing.</v>

2419
01:48:52.900 --> 01:48:57.300
<v Speaker 1>That's a seeds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a nine grain porridge loaf.</v>

01:48:57.630 --> 01:48:58.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the hell?</v>

2421
01:48:58.530 --> 01:49:00.600
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all seeds.</v>

2422
01:49:00.660 --> 01:49:03.690
<v Speaker 1>You're putting seeds on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you not into seeds?</v>

2423
01:49:03.710 --> 01:49:08.090
<v Speaker 1>I like succeeds guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My family doesn't eat seeds well.</v>

2424
01:49:08.130 --> 01:49:10.470
<v Speaker 1>My daughters will be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>leaves a seed on it.</v>

2425
01:49:10.490 --> 01:49:12.210
<v Speaker 1>Don't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about poppy seed?</v>

2426
01:49:12.240 --> 01:49:15.030
<v Speaker 1>How could you not like poppy seed bagels</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the best.</v>

2427
01:49:15.360 --> 01:49:17.520
<v Speaker 1>What does that guy holding a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

2428
01:49:17.580 --> 01:49:19.470
<v Speaker 1>You look at that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my goodness.</v>

2429
01:49:19.471 --> 01:49:20.850
<v Speaker 1>That looks good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at those.</v>

2430
01:49:20.940 --> 01:49:23.220
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about bread folks.</v>

2431
01:49:23.221 --> 01:49:24.870
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how.</v>

2432
01:49:24.960 --> 01:49:28.320
<v Speaker 1>If it's the check,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the they're changing up the flower or if</v>

2433
01:49:28.321 --> 01:49:30.480
<v Speaker 1>it's the intensity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like to get that dark,</v>

2434
01:49:30.481 --> 01:49:33.120
<v Speaker 1>you have to have a really high heat and </v>
<v Speaker 1>beyond it.</v>

2435
01:49:33.300 --> 01:49:35.820
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if like my conventional </v>
<v Speaker 1>stove could do it.</v>

2436
01:49:36.240 --> 01:49:37.073
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What they're doing is almost like </v>

2437
01:49:37.921 --> 01:49:42.921
<v Speaker 1>burning it on the outside almost or at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the door or burning it almost.</v>

2438
01:49:43.950 --> 01:49:44.531
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard.</v>

2439
01:49:44.531 --> 01:49:48.760
<v Speaker 1>The contrast in this is hard to tell </v>
<v Speaker 1>because we might just be looking at some</v>

2440
01:49:48.761 --> 01:49:52.630
<v Speaker 1>weird shadows where the loaf in the back</v>
<v Speaker 1>looks like it's pretty burnt and the one</v>

2441
01:49:52.631 --> 01:49:53.630
<v Speaker 1>in the front looks burnt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>

2442
01:49:53.640 --> 01:49:55.810
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to see what it actually looks </v>
<v Speaker 1>like in the flesh,</v>

2443
01:49:55.811 --> 01:49:56.050
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>

2444
01:49:56.050 --> 01:49:56.890
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so good.</v>

2445
01:49:57.360 --> 01:50:01.130
<v Speaker 1>It is dark,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means I don't think it's looked at</v>

2446
01:50:01.180 --> 01:50:01.691
<v Speaker 1>bats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2447
01:50:01.691 --> 01:50:03.710
<v Speaker 1>Let me ask you this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how spongy that is though.</v>

2448
01:50:03.711 --> 01:50:06.760
<v Speaker 1>It's really good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're looking at the site people like,</v>

2449
01:50:06.761 --> 01:50:07.594
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck are they looking at?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're looking at the side profile of </v>

2450
01:50:11.340 --> 01:50:12.750
<v Speaker 1>these little holes in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2451
01:50:13.060 --> 01:50:13.893
<v Speaker 1>Let me ask you this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's called the crumb butter or no </v>

2452
01:50:15.780 --> 01:50:17.980
<v Speaker 1>butter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2453
01:50:19.600 --> 01:50:20.710
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2454
01:50:21.220 --> 01:50:24.130
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I fucking knew it.</v>

2455
01:50:24.610 --> 01:50:27.130
<v Speaker 1>You don't use butter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like butter.</v>

2456
01:50:27.160 --> 01:50:30.190
<v Speaker 1>How dare you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you liked butter,</v>

2457
01:50:30.191 --> 01:50:33.400
<v Speaker 1>you'd like butter on bread.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say That's where it sits best.</v>

2458
01:50:33.401 --> 01:50:34.234
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's this butter does its best </v>

2459
01:50:35.591 --> 01:50:37.690
<v Speaker 1>work is this other stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty good too.</v>

2460
01:50:37.720 --> 01:50:39.700
<v Speaker 1>So anytime time we're butter you allow </v>
<v Speaker 1>it to be cold.</v>

2461
01:50:40.170 --> 01:50:41.003
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the only time where you allow your </v>

2462
01:50:42.101 --> 01:50:45.370
<v Speaker 1>butter to be cold and you spread your </v>
<v Speaker 1>butter on a loaf of bread.</v>

2463
01:50:45.400 --> 01:50:46.233
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's when you don't mind the cold </v>

2464
01:50:47.081 --> 01:50:48.250
<v Speaker 1>butter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Martha Stewart.</v>

2465
01:50:48.251 --> 01:50:50.950
<v Speaker 1>Tell me you shouldn't leave your bread.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your butter out on the counter.</v>

2466
01:50:51.040 --> 01:50:51.873
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tell Martha Stewart you shouldn't </v>

2467
01:50:52.721 --> 01:50:57.721
<v Speaker 1>fucking cheat on your taxes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's my girlfriend actually.</v>

2469
01:51:01.410 --> 01:51:02.870
<v Speaker 1>So insider trading.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Are you supposed to not respond to tips?</v>

2473
01:51:08.980 --> 01:51:11.320

<v Speaker 1>They're all doing it.</v>

2474
01:51:11.710 --> 01:51:12.590
<v Speaker 1>They are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2475
01:51:12.660 --> 01:51:14.740
<v Speaker 1>I think they're all insider trading.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>

<v Speaker 1>nice sour dill.</v>

2479
01:51:26.380 --> 01:51:27.730
<v Speaker 1>If I got a tip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like,</v>

2480
01:51:27.880 --> 01:51:29.490

2481
01:51:29.910 --> 01:51:30.743
<v Speaker 1>Might explain this to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but please do again because I'm </v>

2482
01:51:32.471 --> 01:51:33.304
<v Speaker 1>retarded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is a sourdough have that flavor and </v>

2483
01:51:37.871 --> 01:51:38.704
<v Speaker 1>why it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone said that it's like it's almost </v>

2484
01:51:41.111 --> 01:51:41.944
<v Speaker 1>gluten free,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's like it's not the same as </v>

2485
01:51:44.081 --> 01:51:45.310
<v Speaker 1>regular bread.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that true?</v>

2486
01:51:45.370 --> 01:51:48.410
<v Speaker 1>It is true and I don't really know the </v>
<v Speaker 1>science behind it,</v>

2487
01:51:48.450 --> 01:51:50.500
<v Speaker 1>but just giving it to friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

2488
01:51:50.501 --> 01:51:51.334
<v Speaker 1>but I've given it to friends that have </v>
<v Speaker 1>gluten intolerant problem and they they </v>

2489
01:51:55.301 --> 01:51:57.880
<v Speaker 1>are able to digest it a lot easier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tom Papa,</v>

2490
01:51:57.881 --> 01:51:59.320
<v Speaker 1>using his friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his Guinea pigs here.</v>

2491
01:51:59.321 --> 01:52:00.520
<v Speaker 1>Let's see if you shake yourself.</v>

2492
01:52:03.230 --> 01:52:06.520
<v Speaker 1>Have some gluten free bread crumbs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just eat it.</v>

2493
01:52:08.280 --> 01:52:12.220
<v Speaker 1>If you ask for gluten free at this place</v>
<v Speaker 1>where they spit in your face.</v>

2494
01:52:12.690 --> 01:52:14.490
<v Speaker 1>Good Americans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2495
01:52:14.550 --> 01:52:16.000
<v Speaker 1>Probably.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2496
01:52:16.001 --> 01:52:17.200
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are in Venice.</v>

2497
01:52:17.201 --> 01:52:18.340
<v Speaker 1>They probably.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2498
01:52:18.400 --> 01:52:20.230
<v Speaker 1>Listen to me folks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bread is bad for you.</v>

2499
01:52:20.260 --> 01:52:25.260
<v Speaker 1>It's not make the best bad for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do the best you can taste the best while</v>

2500
01:52:25.811 --> 01:52:27.310
<v Speaker 1>it's bad for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so good.</v>

2501
01:52:27.840 --> 01:52:31.030
<v Speaker 1>If that's the one car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fermentation time,</v>

2502
01:52:32.330 --> 01:52:36.910
<v Speaker 1>the bacteria that builds up stops or </v>
<v Speaker 1>breaks down the gluten proteins.</v>

2503
01:52:36.970 --> 01:52:37.803
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you need gluten for the structure of </v>

2504
01:52:39.701 --> 01:52:41.440
<v Speaker 1>the bread.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it still has gluten.</v>

2505
01:52:41.610 --> 01:52:43.130
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it does have some glute.</v>

2506
01:52:43.131 --> 01:52:43.964
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's the framework that's </v>

2507
01:52:44.351 --> 01:52:46.550
<v Speaker 1>making it big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you don't eat the crust,</v>

2508
01:52:46.580 --> 01:52:48.560
<v Speaker 1>maybe you don't get the gluten.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2509
01:52:48.561 --> 01:52:51.330
<v Speaker 1>it's in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's in there.</v>

2510
01:52:51.830 --> 01:52:54.830
<v Speaker 1>Interesting to do science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there might be some other stuff.</v>

2511
01:52:54.831 --> 01:52:55.664
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the problem really my just gut </v>

2512
01:52:58.100 --> 01:53:01.100
<v Speaker 1>instinct is that when you're eating all </v>
<v Speaker 1>this gluten with other stuff,</v>

2513
01:53:01.430 --> 01:53:02.263
<v Speaker 1>it's so much other stuff added in there </v>
<v Speaker 1>that maybe interacting with the gluten </v>

2514
01:53:06.411 --> 01:53:09.860
<v Speaker 1>that's made giving you the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This bread has three ingredients.</v>

2515
01:53:09.890 --> 01:53:14.270
<v Speaker 1>You sound like an apologist and water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>flour and salt.</v>

2516
01:53:14.271 --> 01:53:15.104
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're not getting all this extra </v>

2517
01:53:18.020 --> 01:53:18.853
<v Speaker 1>additives and stuff that are in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's what's giving people </v>

2518
01:53:21.531 --> 01:53:22.364
<v Speaker 1>really the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you think like preservatives and </v>

2519
01:53:23.841 --> 01:53:27.620
<v Speaker 1>bread that like commercial bakeries use </v>
<v Speaker 1>32 ingredients.</v>

2520
01:53:28.460 --> 01:53:31.040
<v Speaker 1>Ingredients are they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't even pronounce them.</v>

2521
01:53:31.130 --> 01:53:34.670
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you mean know what makes you make a good</v>

2522
01:53:34.671 --> 01:53:35.504
<v Speaker 1>point?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The FDA had to change the definition of </v>

2523
01:53:37.401 --> 01:53:41.630
<v Speaker 1>what bread was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they could deal with these commercial</v>

2524
01:53:41.631 --> 01:53:42.780
<v Speaker 1>breads.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not healing.</v>

2525
01:53:42.830 --> 01:53:43.663
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not really technically what a </v>

2526
01:53:44.691 --> 01:53:45.260
<v Speaker 1>bread is.</v>

2527
01:53:45.260 --> 01:53:47.840
<v Speaker 1>If you add all this other stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not really bread.</v>

2528
01:53:47.870 --> 01:53:49.850
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so like what is wonder bread?</v>

<v Speaker 1>look at this.</v>

2554
01:54:52.370 --> 01:54:53.203
<v Speaker 1>Go back to just that one might,</v>

<v Speaker 1>wondering,</v>

2556
01:54:56.200 --> 01:54:57.033
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is it says wonder bread </v>

2557
01:54:58.911 --> 01:55:00.840
<v Speaker 1>ingredients.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's keep fucking lying then.</v>

2558
01:55:01.950 --> 01:55:05.270
<v Speaker 1>This fake news is fake news.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ammonium chloride,</v>

2559
01:55:05.300 --> 01:55:06.490
<v Speaker 1>W,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where do we stop your.</v>

2560
01:55:06.491 --> 01:55:07.324
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>calcium dioxide and slash or as old die </v>

2561
01:55:10.390 --> 01:55:13.430
<v Speaker 1>carbon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2562
01:55:14.110 --> 01:55:19.110
<v Speaker 1>but now I'm gonna Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This ammonium chloride.</v>

2563
01:55:19.490 --> 01:55:24.350
<v Speaker 1>Ammonium sulfate and or Amano.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Calcium phosphate.</v>

01:55:24.800 --> 01:55:28.910
<v Speaker 1>Calcium propynate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Innate ammonium sulfate.</v>

2565
01:55:29.750 --> 01:55:31.910
<v Speaker 1>Ammonium in your bread.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jimmy.</v>

2566
01:55:31.911 --> 01:55:33.140
<v Speaker 1>You must find that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If that's real,</v>

2567
01:55:33.141 --> 01:55:34.910
<v Speaker 1>now you have perplexed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to pee.</v>

2568
01:55:34.940 --> 01:55:35.601
<v Speaker 1>Can I pay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2569
01:55:35.601 --> 01:55:36.434
<v Speaker 1>please.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll just keep reading the ingredients </v>

2570
01:55:37.851 --> 01:55:39.620
<v Speaker 1>for right off the bag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2571
01:55:39.621 --> 01:55:41.960
<v Speaker 1>Right off the combine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's all those things.</v>

2572
01:55:42.020 --> 01:55:44.190
<v Speaker 1>That was all those things we were just </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about.</v>

2573
01:55:44.850 --> 01:55:47.070
<v Speaker 5>So all that stuff really is in there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

2574
01:55:47.071 --> 01:55:50.880
<v Speaker 5>That's nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's I guess,</v>

2575
01:55:52.830 --> 01:55:53.940
<v Speaker 5>boy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2576
01:55:53.941 --> 01:55:54.774
<v Speaker 5>you run into that thing where you say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well if you want to have bread on the </v>

2577
01:55:57.511 --> 01:56:00.570
<v Speaker 5>shelves in places where they're not </v>
<v Speaker 5>growing any food,</v>

2578
01:56:01.290 --> 01:56:04.620
<v Speaker 5>like in order for it to be fresh enough </v>
<v Speaker 5>for you to eat and not get sick,</v>

2579
01:56:05.150 --> 01:56:07.710
<v Speaker 5>you got to have some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 5>preservatives in the bread.</v>

2580
01:56:09.020 --> 01:56:09.853
<v Speaker 5>Just like would one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would like to know definitively how </v>

2581
01:56:14.011 --> 01:56:16.470
<v Speaker 5>much those preservatives have an effect </v>
<v Speaker 5>on your health.</v>

2582
01:56:16.780 --> 01:56:17.613
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like everybody assumes they're really </v>

2583
01:56:18.451 --> 01:56:19.320
<v Speaker 5>bad for you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

2584
01:56:19.620 --> 01:56:21.030
<v Speaker 5>Don't you assume they're really bad for </v>
<v Speaker 5>you?</v>

2585
01:56:21.540 --> 01:56:22.373
<v Speaker 5>I do too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would like to know what the fuck they </v>

2586
01:56:24.571 --> 01:56:28.110
<v Speaker 5>do because what they're doing is they're</v>
<v Speaker 5>not allowing bacterial growth.</v>

2587
01:56:28.111 --> 01:56:29.820
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That sort of preservative is.</v>

2588
01:56:30.030 --> 01:56:33.210
<v Speaker 5>So if you have a loaf of bread and you </v>
<v Speaker 5>put preservatives in it,</v>

2589
01:56:33.270 --> 01:56:34.103
<v Speaker 5>it's stunting bacterial growth,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which will eventually take over and you </v>

2590
01:56:36.601 --> 01:56:37.800
<v Speaker 5>brought your bread will get moldy.</v>

2591
01:56:37.840 --> 01:56:39.450
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that's a,</v>

2592
01:56:39.480 --> 01:56:40.313
<v Speaker 5>that's a poison.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you've got some sort of a poison on </v>

2593
01:56:42.841 --> 01:56:43.650
<v Speaker 5>your bread.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2594
01:56:43.650 --> 01:56:45.660
<v Speaker 5>It keeps it from being edible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The bacteria.</v>

2595
01:56:45.661 --> 01:56:47.880
<v Speaker 5>So instead of eating bread while it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>fresh,</v>

2596
01:56:48.030 --> 01:56:48.863
<v Speaker 5>when you're supposed to eat it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the only time you're supposed to lead </v>

2597
01:56:50.311 --> 01:56:51.144
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you've got some chemicals pumped into </v>

2598
01:56:52.441 --> 01:56:54.390
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What's that doing to your body?</v>

2599
01:56:54.450 --> 01:56:56.280
<v Speaker 5>Exactly messing it up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2600
01:56:56.370 --> 01:56:57.203
<v Speaker 5>what do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's doing,</v>

2601
01:56:58.260 --> 01:56:59.093
<v Speaker 5>what it's doing physically to your body.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's probably making it difficult to </v>

2602
01:57:01.921 --> 01:57:02.754
<v Speaker 5>digest things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're probably not transferring real </v>

2603
01:57:05.161 --> 01:57:05.994
<v Speaker 5>food into this nutrients that you need.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Your system's going to work on this </v>

2604
01:57:09.181 --> 01:57:09.601
<v Speaker 5>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2605
01:57:09.601 --> 01:57:10.434
<v Speaker 5>Anything you put in your body,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your body seems to react right and deal </v>

2606
01:57:13.531 --> 01:57:14.364
<v Speaker 5>with it has to deal with it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's probably dealing with that and not </v>

2607
01:57:17.260 --> 01:57:21.150
<v Speaker 5>slowing down some other processes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's bro Science for you.</v>

2608
01:57:21.300 --> 01:57:22.133
<v Speaker 5>But I bet your bro Science makes lot of </v>
<v Speaker 5>sense and I also bet your bro Science </v>

2609
01:57:24.811 --> 01:57:26.070
<v Speaker 5>could point to that.</v>

2610
01:57:26.220 --> 01:57:28.770
<v Speaker 5>If you're taking in these things that </v>
<v Speaker 5>are anti,</v>

2611
01:57:28.930 --> 01:57:29.763
<v Speaker 5>they essentially they stunt.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is again super pro science there </v>

2612
01:57:32.940 --> 01:57:37.740
<v Speaker 5>stunting these microbes growing on bread</v>
<v Speaker 5>and mold growing on bread,</v>

2613
01:57:37.980 --> 01:57:40.240
<v Speaker 5>but you have a bunch of gut flora </v>
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible].</v>

2614
01:57:40.500 --> 01:57:43.740
<v Speaker 5>So if you take that stuff and you put it</v>
<v Speaker 5>inside your gut,</v>

2615
01:57:43.800 --> 01:57:48.220
<v Speaker 5>your gut flora has to be dealing with at</v>
<v Speaker 5>least some of that interest.</v>

2616
01:57:48.240 --> 01:57:49.073
<v Speaker 5>How much is left,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how much of the preservative is in the </v>

2617
01:57:50.311 --> 01:57:52.560
<v Speaker 5>bread while your body's trying to break </v>
<v Speaker 5>it down?</v>

2618
01:57:52.740 --> 01:57:56.640
<v Speaker 5>Where this gut flora is used to </v>
<v Speaker 5>digesting organic material,</v>

2619
01:57:56.850 --> 01:58:00.720
<v Speaker 5>now it's dealing with sodium lauryl icon</v>
<v Speaker 5>of fucking plastic,</v>

2620
01:58:00.840 --> 01:58:02.730
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Calla fragile listic.</v>

2621
01:58:02.850 --> 01:58:03.683
<v Speaker 5>It's probably taking out some of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>stuff that you need to fight off other </v>

2622
01:58:05.551 --> 01:58:06.384
<v Speaker 5>stuff and you're percent man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's why antibiotics are so bad for </v>

2623
01:58:09.331 --> 01:58:11.160
<v Speaker 5>you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not because they don't cure diseases,</v>

2624
01:58:11.161 --> 01:58:11.994
<v Speaker 5>they definitely do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but because they also wreck your whole </v>

2625
01:58:14.460 --> 01:58:15.293
<v Speaker 5>biome,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like you have to take a bunch of </v>

2626
01:58:16.741 --> 01:58:20.280
<v Speaker 5>probiotics and try and get your system </v>
<v Speaker 5>back to operating.</v>

2627
01:58:20.520 --> 01:58:21.353
<v Speaker 5>People have sometimes problems for quite</v>
<v Speaker 5>a long time after operations because of </v>

2628
01:58:24.991 --> 01:58:26.760
<v Speaker 5>the probiotics,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the probiotics,</v>

2629
01:58:26.761 --> 01:58:29.430
<v Speaker 5>which are important to keep you from </v>
<v Speaker 5>getting infections,</v>

2630
01:58:29.431 --> 01:58:32.030
<v Speaker 5>but they're not without a price like </v>
<v Speaker 5>your.</v>

2631
01:58:32.031 --> 01:58:34.230
<v Speaker 5>Your body pays a price for that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2632
01:58:34.740 --> 01:58:35.573
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's been times when you walk in and </v>

2633
01:58:37.531 --> 01:58:38.460
<v Speaker 5>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you had a bread,</v>

2634
01:58:38.461 --> 01:58:39.294
<v Speaker 5>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>an Italian bread that you bought this </v>

2635
01:58:40.200 --> 01:58:42.160
<v Speaker 5>from the supermarket and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>three days</v>

2636
01:58:42.160 --> 01:58:42.821
<v Speaker 1>later you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2637
01:58:42.821 --> 01:58:44.700
<v Speaker 1>this is probably no soft.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could eat,</v>

2638
01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:47.680
<v Speaker 1>I could eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is like a week later.</v>

2639
01:58:47.681 --> 01:58:49.000
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not good.</v>

2640
01:58:49.240 --> 01:58:51.490
<v Speaker 1>How long is a loaf of bread supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>last?</v>

2641
01:58:51.700 --> 01:58:52.533
<v Speaker 1>If when you cut it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it should start getting hard </v>

2642
01:58:55.211 --> 01:58:58.380
<v Speaker 1>immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really like by the next day like that.</v>

2643
01:58:58.500 --> 01:58:59.333
<v Speaker 1>That part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that part that you've cut to expose the </v>

2644
01:59:01.181 --> 01:59:02.850
<v Speaker 1>stuff that's under the crust,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2645
01:59:03.030 --> 01:59:04.310
<v Speaker 1>it could last for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2646
01:59:04.370 --> 01:59:05.620
<v Speaker 1>three days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>four days.</v>

2647
01:59:05.980 --> 01:59:09.400
<v Speaker 1>My grandfather lived in a hard though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an Italian neighborhood.</v>

2648
01:59:09.640 --> 01:59:11.500
<v Speaker 1>All Italian neighborhood in North New </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jersey.</v>

2649
01:59:11.590 --> 01:59:14.080
<v Speaker 1>Oh Nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when I was a little kid,</v>

2650
01:59:14.860 --> 01:59:18.220
<v Speaker 1>we used to go to the bread store.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He used to go to the bakery,</v>

2651
01:59:18.700 --> 01:59:19.533
<v Speaker 1>to the bakery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like every couple of days they would </v>

2652
01:59:21.520 --> 01:59:24.100
<v Speaker 1>have a loaf of bread.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would sit on the kitchen table.</v>

2653
01:59:24.310 --> 01:59:28.360
<v Speaker 1>They would chop from the white paper </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrapper and pull it out of the wrapper a</v>

2654
01:59:28.361 --> 01:59:30.070
<v Speaker 1>little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cut some slices,</v>

2655
01:59:30.071 --> 01:59:31.930
<v Speaker 1>push it back in the wrapper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kinda roll it up,</v>

2656
01:59:32.170 --> 01:59:34.030
<v Speaker 1>but everybody knew it was good for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>couple of days.</v>

2657
01:59:34.320 --> 01:59:38.110
<v Speaker 1>Couple of days later my grandpa would go</v>
<v Speaker 1>down to the bakery and get it again,</v>

2658
01:59:38.111 --> 01:59:38.944
<v Speaker 1>and this same place had been in </v>
<v Speaker 1>operation since the 19 twenties and </v>

2659
01:59:42.401 --> 01:59:43.810
<v Speaker 1>stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's great.</v>

2660
01:59:43.960 --> 01:59:46.990
<v Speaker 1>And it was just a cool little </v>
<v Speaker 1>neighborhood bakery.</v>

2661
01:59:47.050 --> 01:59:49.450
<v Speaker 1>It's the vast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then till you would go,</v>

2662
01:59:49.620 --> 01:59:51.460
<v Speaker 1>you would do that with all your foods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He would do.</v>

2663
01:59:51.580 --> 01:59:53.200
<v Speaker 1>Then you go to the fruit guy and get </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2664
01:59:53.201 --> 01:59:55.450
<v Speaker 1>Then you get your meat from that guy and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was all.</v>

2665
01:59:55.960 --> 01:59:59.720
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't all meant to last forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2666
01:59:59.790 --> 02:00:01.750
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think when I think about the time,</v>

2667
02:00:01.751 --> 02:00:02.584
<v Speaker 1>like we were talking about how hard it </v>
<v Speaker 1>is to eat when you're on the road and </v>

2668
02:00:05.171 --> 02:00:07.360
<v Speaker 1>like you know when you're pressed for </v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

2669
02:00:07.390 --> 02:00:08.223
<v Speaker 1>if you're running between obligations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have all these different things </v>

2670
02:00:10.931 --> 02:00:11.840
<v Speaker 1>you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2671
02:00:12.120 --> 02:00:13.960
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to get good food in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>

2672
02:00:14.080 --> 02:00:15.130
<v Speaker 1>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2673
02:00:15.131 --> 02:00:15.790
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>

2674
02:00:15.790 --> 02:00:20.140
<v Speaker 1>I did this weekend and I was eating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I ate horribly,</v>

2675
02:00:20.200 --> 02:00:21.033
<v Speaker 1>I felt I was dragging all weekend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just was putting crap in my body in a </v>

2676
02:00:27.071 --> 02:00:30.520
<v Speaker 1>pinch and a w.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It made it so hard.</v>

2677
02:00:30.521 --> 02:00:31.870
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you're in a hotel and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2678
02:00:32.180 --> 02:00:33.810
<v Speaker 1>is there a side vegetable?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can I have a,</v>

2679
02:00:33.840 --> 02:00:36.610
<v Speaker 1>just a site and they know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what do you mean?</v>

2680
02:00:36.611 --> 02:00:39.130
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have a vegetable for me.</v>

2681
02:00:39.760 --> 02:00:40.301
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2682
02:00:40.301 --> 02:00:42.520
<v Speaker 1>it's really bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's why I'm,</v>

2683
02:00:42.790 --> 02:00:47.320
<v Speaker 1>I've made two loaves at a time and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>literally have to go back to New York,</v>

2684
02:00:47.321 --> 02:00:49.960
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tomorrow and I just got in yesterday.</v>

2685
02:00:50.020 --> 02:00:50.853
<v Speaker 1>So while I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got in fed the starter to get the </v>

2686
02:00:54.041 --> 02:00:57.520
<v Speaker 1>bread going and now when I go home and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then I made it into dough.</v>

2687
02:00:57.521 --> 02:00:58.354
<v Speaker 1>This morning it's rising now I'll go </v>
<v Speaker 1>back and bake this bread and then </v>

2688
02:01:01.661 --> 02:01:04.060
<v Speaker 1>they'll have bread for the week until I </v>
<v Speaker 1>come back on Friday.</v>

2689
02:01:04.120 --> 02:01:05.770
<v Speaker 1>That's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's my job.</v>

2690
02:01:05.980 --> 02:01:08.110
<v Speaker 1>That's so cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's my job at the house.</v>

2691
02:01:08.710 --> 02:01:09.543
<v Speaker 1>That's so nice because that's something </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to think about you every </v>

2692
02:01:11.801 --> 02:01:14.020
<v Speaker 1>time they eat your bread.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Daddy makes this.</v>

2693
02:01:14.050 --> 02:01:14.883
<v Speaker 1>It's funny because my kids will send me </v>
<v Speaker 1>pictures of sourdough from when they're </v>

2694
02:01:17.560 --> 02:01:19.570
<v Speaker 1>like at a restaurant with your friends </v>
<v Speaker 1>or something.</v>

2695
02:01:19.571 --> 02:01:24.571
<v Speaker 1>It'd be like not very good what I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to get out though.</v>

2696
02:01:27.880 --> 02:01:28.713
<v Speaker 1>When you're on the road and you're on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the hustle and you're doing so many </v>

2697
02:01:30.521 --> 02:01:31.354
<v Speaker 1>different things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have a chance to eat well and </v>

2698
02:01:32.681 --> 02:01:33.514
<v Speaker 1>you definitely don't have the chance to </v>
<v Speaker 1>like have a loaf of bread and take some </v>

2699
02:01:36.701 --> 02:01:40.230
<v Speaker 1>slices out of it and then get loan and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>couple of days,</v>

2700
02:01:40.230 --> 02:01:41.063
<v Speaker 5>like most people that are way too busy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But what I was going to get at is it's </v>

2701
02:01:43.561 --> 02:01:46.490
<v Speaker 5>Kinda like what you were talking about </v>
<v Speaker 5>before that could you downsize,</v>

2702
02:01:46.750 --> 02:01:48.290
<v Speaker 5>could you downsize,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and if you did,</v>

2703
02:01:48.440 --> 02:01:50.240
<v Speaker 5>would you be happier?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You might be.</v>

2704
02:01:50.450 --> 02:01:52.580
<v Speaker 5>You might be happier if you did less </v>
<v Speaker 5>stuff.</v>

2705
02:01:52.581 --> 02:01:54.470
<v Speaker 5>You might be happier if you calm down </v>
<v Speaker 5>more.</v>

2706
02:01:54.570 --> 02:01:55.403
<v Speaker 5>Might be happier if you went and got </v>
<v Speaker 5>bread every couple of days where you </v>

2707
02:01:57.231 --> 02:01:58.850
<v Speaker 5>made your own bread every couple of </v>
<v Speaker 5>days.</v>

2708
02:01:59.690 --> 02:02:02.390
<v Speaker 5>Whatever is keeping you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't do that on too busy.</v>

2709
02:02:02.510 --> 02:02:05.380
<v Speaker 5>Whatever that is might be the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like we,</v>

2710
02:02:05.540 --> 02:02:09.380
<v Speaker 5>we might in our rush to be successful.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think a lot of people.</v>

2711
02:02:10.040 --> 02:02:13.880
<v Speaker 5>I think it's totally possible that you </v>
<v Speaker 5>overshoot the happiness spot.</v>

2712
02:02:14.140 --> 02:02:15.490
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2713
02:02:15.520 --> 02:02:16.630
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2714
02:02:16.631 --> 02:02:17.464
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>

2715
02:02:18.030 --> 02:02:23.030
<v Speaker 3>if I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I was the Tom Papa that started stand</v>

2716
02:02:23.031 --> 02:02:27.670
<v Speaker 3>up for the first week and you'd showed </v>
<v Speaker 3>me where I'm at now,</v>

2717
02:02:28.450 --> 02:02:29.710
<v Speaker 3>I would think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2718
02:02:29.711 --> 02:02:34.711
<v Speaker 3>pure bliss bliss and now I am where I </v>
<v Speaker 3>am.</v>

2719
02:02:35.441 --> 02:02:37.810
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2720
02:02:37.811 --> 02:02:39.520
<v Speaker 3>I think that old guy might've been a </v>
<v Speaker 3>little happier.</v>

2721
02:02:41.130 --> 02:02:44.440
<v Speaker 3>Piglet guy who's just doing a spot for </v>
<v Speaker 3>five bucks at the comic strip.</v>

2722
02:02:45.010 --> 02:02:47.700
<v Speaker 3>That guy was pretty happy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Especially.</v>

2723
02:02:47.780 --> 02:02:47.940
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2724
02:02:47.940 --> 02:02:50.940
<v Speaker 5>Now when you know that you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 5>wind up being successful.</v>

2725
02:02:51.320 --> 02:02:52.153
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the thing about like when the </v>

2726
02:02:53.461 --> 02:02:55.950
<v Speaker 5>unknown is very stressful.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's true.</v>

2727
02:02:56.570 --> 02:02:59.550
<v Speaker 5>At that time you were like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>am I ever going to get on Conan?</v>

2728
02:02:59.610 --> 02:03:02.910
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And we all know that one guy,</v>

2729
02:03:02.911 --> 02:03:05.310
<v Speaker 5>at least a few guys.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was really funny,</v>

2730
02:03:05.311 --> 02:03:07.260
<v Speaker 5>but for some reason didn't catch on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2731
02:03:07.650 --> 02:03:08.483
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2732
02:03:08.790 --> 02:03:09.623
<v Speaker 5>I know there's a ton of those guys a ton</v>
<v Speaker 5>and so you'd always think about them </v>

2733
02:03:12.661 --> 02:03:14.430
<v Speaker 5>like what about that guy?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whatever happened to that guy.</v>

2734
02:03:14.580 --> 02:03:15.413
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2735
02:03:15.450 --> 02:03:16.283
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know that.</v>

2736
02:03:16.360 --> 02:03:18.270
<v Speaker 3>The wall of death at a comedy club and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

2737
02:03:20.050 --> 02:03:21.270
<v Speaker 3>all these people go,</v>

2738
02:03:21.450 --> 02:03:25.290
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the store has got a fucking haunted wall</v>

2739
02:03:25.490 --> 02:03:27.710
<v Speaker 5>to wall.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Some of the wallet guys just stopped.</v>

2740
02:03:27.711 --> 02:03:29.330
<v Speaker 5>They just stopped doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>To us,</v>

2741
02:03:29.331 --> 02:03:30.900
<v Speaker 5>it's like someone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One of the scariest things.</v>

2742
02:03:30.901 --> 02:03:31.980
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Terrifying.</v>

2743
02:03:32.220 --> 02:03:33.053
<v Speaker 5>So when you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think we have a romanticizing </v>

2744
02:03:35.190 --> 02:03:37.500
<v Speaker 5>instinct.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The human,</v>

2745
02:03:37.530 --> 02:03:38.363
<v Speaker 5>the human animal does.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We have a gigantic instinct to go back </v>

2746
02:03:41.461 --> 02:03:42.990
<v Speaker 5>to a time where shit made sense.</v>

2747
02:03:43.070 --> 02:03:47.930
<v Speaker 3>Make America great again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Seriously is a novel thing.</v>

2748
02:03:47.931 --> 02:03:49.700
<v Speaker 3>Every girlfriend you were with was </v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty good.</v>

2749
02:03:50.300 --> 02:03:52.600
<v Speaker 3>Everything you did was pretty great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That little,</v>

2750
02:03:52.630 --> 02:03:55.430
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all his little crappy ways.</v>

<v Speaker 3>That was her fun.</v>

2752
02:03:57.700 --> 02:03:58.490
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2753
02:03:58.490 --> 02:03:59.630
<v Speaker 3>At the time you didn't think so.</v>

2754
02:03:59.720 --> 02:04:02.360
<v Speaker 5>Probably so much.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You get in a fight with your girlfriend.</v>

2755
02:04:02.630 --> 02:04:03.463
<v Speaker 5>Think about your ex girlfriend.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She wouldn't have talked to me like </v>

2756
02:04:05.511 --> 02:04:06.010
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

2757
02:04:06.010 --> 02:04:07.480
<v Speaker 3>It's because it's knowable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2758
02:04:07.540 --> 02:04:09.910
<v Speaker 3>Like the future is unknowable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So scary.</v>

2759
02:04:10.270 --> 02:04:13.150
<v Speaker 3>This change that the country was going </v>
<v Speaker 3>under.</v>

2760
02:04:13.151 --> 02:04:15.350
<v Speaker 3>Like what do you mean there's these jobs</v>
<v Speaker 3>are going away.</v>

2761
02:04:15.351 --> 02:04:16.184
<v Speaker 3>What do you mean we're going into soon?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you mean we've got to deal with </v>

2762
02:04:17.741 --> 02:04:18.840
<v Speaker 3>India.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you mean?</v>

2763
02:04:18.910 --> 02:04:21.850
<v Speaker 3>Technology's taking over my life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's scary.</v>

2764
02:04:22.390 --> 02:04:27.390
<v Speaker 3>No picket fence where it go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I get my bread and go perched on my</v>

2765
02:04:27.480 --> 02:04:30.280
<v Speaker 3>desk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's noble.</v>

2766
02:04:30.281 --> 02:04:31.640
<v Speaker 3>It's feels safer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or</v>

2767
02:04:31.750 --> 02:04:34.300
<v Speaker 5>You could break it down to an MAG.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A Mag,</v>

2768
02:04:34.301 --> 02:04:36.640
<v Speaker 5>a Hashtag.</v>

<v Speaker 4>king of the assholes.</v>

2774
02:04:51.330 --> 02:04:52.163
<v Speaker 4>Like he figured out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like he found people that are going to </v>

2775
02:04:56.251 --> 02:04:58.340
<v Speaker 4>support him almost exclusively.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 4>them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were never politically active for </v>

2780

2815
02:06:48.841 --> 02:06:49.674

<v Speaker 1>Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen people say that on twitter.</v>

02:07:57.071 --> 02:07:58.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2838
02:07:58.600 --> 02:08:00.820
<v Speaker 1>You go to black twitter though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're always on black.</v>

2839
02:08:00.821 --> 02:08:04.990
<v Speaker 1>Twitter even having imposed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's always about white males.</v>

2840
02:08:05.050 --> 02:08:07.110
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another white male gets the job.</v>

2841
02:08:07.180 --> 02:08:09.010
<v Speaker 1>Either way you're going to say </v>
<v Speaker 1>salon.com.</v>

2842
02:08:09.011 --> 02:08:09.844
<v Speaker 1>Next.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying that's a big thing and the </v>

2843
02:08:12.231 --> 02:08:17.020
<v Speaker 1>people that guy who's being told that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the jobs aren't for you.</v>

2844
02:08:17.110 --> 02:08:18.520
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's where these other people,</v>

2845
02:08:18.521 --> 02:08:19.354
<v Speaker 1>that's what's coming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're sitting there with your wife </v>

2846
02:08:20.651 --> 02:08:22.390
<v Speaker 1>and two kids and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

2847
02:08:22.450 --> 02:08:23.290
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>

2848
02:08:23.290 --> 02:08:24.123
<v Speaker 1>White guys had a good run.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're saying white guys are kind of </v>

2849
02:08:26.180 --> 02:08:27.190
<v Speaker 1>passe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're done,</v>

2850
02:08:27.220 --> 02:08:28.053
<v Speaker 1>but I got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got Christmas to pay for and they got </v>

2851
02:08:29.920 --> 02:08:30.753
<v Speaker 1>these I got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think that's such an extreme </v>

2852
02:08:32.441 --> 02:08:34.420
<v Speaker 1>perspective on it that why people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>done.</v>

2853
02:08:34.630 --> 02:08:35.463
<v Speaker 1>I think the big perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the much broader perspective on people </v>

2854
02:08:38.951 --> 02:08:39.784
<v Speaker 1>that are trying to encourage diversity </v>
<v Speaker 1>is that they feel like people are </v>

2855
02:08:42.220 --> 02:08:45.130
<v Speaker 1>discriminated against in the past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's time to balance that out.</v>

2856
02:08:45.131 --> 02:08:48.370
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean that white people suck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just means that everybody's great,</v>

2857
02:08:48.400 --> 02:08:51.280
<v Speaker 1>but that's ever bring them all in like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the right way to look at it,</v>

2858
02:08:51.540 --> 02:08:53.470
<v Speaker 1>but you're going to have the extreme </v>
<v Speaker 1>that go.</v>

2859
02:08:53.471 --> 02:08:55.390
<v Speaker 1>White people saw white people stand </v>
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

2860
02:08:55.391 --> 02:08:57.730
<v Speaker 1>White people should just shut the fuck </v>
<v Speaker 1>up and let us talk now,</v>

2861
02:08:58.180 --> 02:09:01.930
<v Speaker 1>but that's always going to be the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're always going to have fluctuations</v>

2862
02:09:01.931 --> 02:09:04.750
<v Speaker 1>inside of a good idea for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's.</v>

2863
02:09:04.900 --> 02:09:06.580
<v Speaker 1>It resonated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think white,</v>

2864
02:09:06.820 --> 02:09:07.653
<v Speaker 1>white people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tell this is a the morning after the </v>

2865
02:09:11.261 --> 02:09:12.880
<v Speaker 1>election,</v>
<v Speaker 1>morning after,</v>

2866
02:09:12.881 --> 02:09:14.770
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That whole night of what the hell?</v>

2867
02:09:14.771 --> 02:09:16.330
<v Speaker 1>What's happened?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who's what?</v>

2868
02:09:17.860 --> 02:09:19.780
<v Speaker 1>I get up in the morning and were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a new puppy.</v>

2869
02:09:19.840 --> 02:09:22.150
<v Speaker 1>I take my puppy outside at 6:00</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the morning,</v>

2870
02:09:22.151 --> 02:09:23.080
<v Speaker 1>6:30</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the morning.</v>

2871
02:09:23.081 --> 02:09:27.400
<v Speaker 1>I'm outside with the dog and I here in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2872
02:09:28.050 --> 02:09:29.410
<v Speaker 1>in the distance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a quiet,</v>

2873
02:09:29.770 --> 02:09:31.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>upscale neighborhood.</v>

2874
02:09:31.180 --> 02:09:31.560
<v Speaker 1>I hear,</v>

2875
02:09:31.560 --> 02:09:32.393
<v Speaker 7>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2876
02:09:32.610 --> 02:09:35.390
<v Speaker 7>Can you believe it?</v>
<v Speaker 7>No Way Michael.</v>

2877
02:09:35.780 --> 02:09:36.613
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this has gotta be it's gotTa be about </v>

2878
02:09:38.301 --> 02:09:39.340
<v Speaker 1>the election there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like,</v>

2879
02:09:39.500 --> 02:09:41.390
<v Speaker 1>I know I couldn't believe it happened </v>
<v Speaker 1>either.</v>

2880
02:09:41.990 --> 02:09:42.823
<v Speaker 1>Peer through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go through the bushes and I see a </v>

2881
02:09:44.841 --> 02:09:46.880
<v Speaker 1>white Mercedes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a white Mercedes.</v>

2882
02:09:47.030 --> 02:09:49.820
<v Speaker 1>A guy's talking to another guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're talking.</v>

2883
02:09:49.821 --> 02:09:52.610
<v Speaker 1>I can hardly understand what they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying and as the guy leaves,</v>

2884
02:09:53.090 --> 02:09:54.320
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right man,</v>

2885
02:09:54.321 --> 02:09:58.400
<v Speaker 1>I'll see you soon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>White lives matter and takes off.</v>

2886
02:09:58.550 --> 02:10:02.450
<v Speaker 1>This is a guy doing well in a Mercedes </v>
<v Speaker 1>living in this nice neighborhood.</v>

2887
02:10:02.600 --> 02:10:04.640
<v Speaker 1>And that was the first thing I heard the</v>
<v Speaker 1>next morning.</v>

2888
02:10:06.140 --> 02:10:07.700
<v Speaker 1>There is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't,</v>

2889
02:10:07.850 --> 02:10:11.360
<v Speaker 1>you can't say that anybody else doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>matter.</v>

2890
02:10:11.420 --> 02:10:12.253
<v Speaker 1>You can't put.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Make people feel like they don't exist </v>

2891
02:10:14.660 --> 02:10:15.493
<v Speaker 1>because they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they will fight back on all sides all </v>

2892
02:10:17.361 --> 02:10:19.100
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a very good point.</v>

2893
02:10:19.400 --> 02:10:21.650
<v Speaker 1>And that's unfortunately with some </v>
<v Speaker 1>people here,</v>

2894
02:10:21.651 --> 02:10:24.500
<v Speaker 1>like if you hear black lives matter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>were you here as well?</v>

2895
02:10:24.590 --> 02:10:25.423
<v Speaker 1>That means white lives don't or that </v>
<v Speaker 1>means white lives do less or that means </v>

2896
02:10:29.780 --> 02:10:30.900
<v Speaker 1>we're trying to call,</v>
<v Speaker 1>call,</v>

2897
02:10:31.130 --> 02:10:34.040
<v Speaker 1>call attention to one very specific </v>
<v Speaker 1>only.</v>

2898
02:10:34.100 --> 02:10:34.933
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And even though I completely understand </v>

2899
02:10:36.561 --> 02:10:37.394
<v Speaker 5>why they're doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think there's anything wrong </v>

2900
02:10:38.391 --> 02:10:39.224
<v Speaker 5>with black lives matter.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think there's anything wrong </v>

2901
02:10:40.221 --> 02:10:41.054
<v Speaker 5>with the idea of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I think I didn't have this reaction </v>

2902
02:10:43.611 --> 02:10:45.680
<v Speaker 5>to it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I know that some people probably did</v>

2903
02:10:45.860 --> 02:10:46.910
<v Speaker 5>they immediately go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

2904
02:10:46.911 --> 02:10:50.540
<v Speaker 5>What about what people just debts up </v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking knee jerk or.</v>

2905
02:10:50.750 --> 02:10:51.583
<v Speaker 5>And that might not have had to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I think sometimes ideas the way </v>

2906
02:10:56.511 --> 02:10:58.610
<v Speaker 5>they're displayed,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like sometimes people,</v>

2907
02:10:59.000 --> 02:10:59.833
<v Speaker 5>they do it because it feels like the </v>
<v Speaker 5>right thing to do at the time of the </v>

2908
02:11:02.391 --> 02:11:03.224
<v Speaker 5>right way to say it at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But anytime you're inviting any sort of </v>

2909
02:11:07.041 --> 02:11:07.874
<v Speaker 5>like anger or dispute,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it feels like you want to do that to </v>

2910
02:11:10.551 --> 02:11:12.530
<v Speaker 5>push back.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But that shit is going to come back this</v>

2911
02:11:12.531 --> 02:11:14.720
<v Speaker 5>way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's way easier said than done.</v>

2912
02:11:15.620 --> 02:11:20.620
<v Speaker 5>But I think that all a lot of what we </v>
<v Speaker 5>see from this reaction to to anything,</v>

2913
02:11:22.570 --> 02:11:25.400
<v Speaker 5>it's like a aggressively progressive.</v>

2914
02:11:25.920 --> 02:11:28.700
<v Speaker 5>Like people when they feel like they're </v>
<v Speaker 5>pushed,</v>

2915
02:11:28.970 --> 02:11:31.490
<v Speaker 5>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have to listen to the way we see the</v>

2916
02:11:31.491 --> 02:11:34.310
<v Speaker 5>world,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then they want to go the fuck I do.</v>

2917
02:11:34.590 --> 02:11:35.423
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like they want to push back and almost </v>

2918
02:11:37.730 --> 02:11:40.280
<v Speaker 5>ramp up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>doubled down on the racism,</v>

2919
02:11:40.281 --> 02:11:44.180
<v Speaker 5>doubled down on their xenophobia,</v>
<v Speaker 5>trying to correct wrongs.</v>

2920
02:11:44.181 --> 02:11:45.014
<v Speaker 5>That kid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It could come off as being aggressive </v>

2921
02:11:46.791 --> 02:11:49.730
<v Speaker 5>and bullying to those people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2922
02:11:49.790 --> 02:11:52.410
<v Speaker 5>Especially if you don't agree with them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

2923
02:11:53.150 --> 02:11:54.170
<v Speaker 5>here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

2924
02:11:54.530 --> 02:11:56.570
<v Speaker 5>Everybody thinks they're right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whether it's you're on,</v>

2925
02:11:56.630 --> 02:11:57.463
<v Speaker 5>you're on the right or the left.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everybody thinks they have a moral </v>

2926
02:11:59.121 --> 02:11:59.954
<v Speaker 5>imperative.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everybody thinks that they're doing the </v>

2927
02:12:00.861 --> 02:12:03.090
<v Speaker 5>right thing unless your piece of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right,</v>

2928
02:12:03.140 --> 02:12:03.973
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's assume people aren't for the most </v>

2929
02:12:05.451 --> 02:12:06.350
<v Speaker 5>part,</v>
<v Speaker 5>are pieces of shit.</v>

2930
02:12:06.380 --> 02:12:07.820
<v Speaker 5>They think they're doing the right </v>
<v Speaker 5>thing,</v>

2931
02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:12.380
<v Speaker 5>but this is the way they've grown up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's just so much of it as cultural.</v>

2932
02:12:12.770 --> 02:12:14.690
<v Speaker 5>When you look at the world today,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're,</v>

2933
02:12:14.750 --> 02:12:15.583
<v Speaker 5>we're all just human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there's people that are living in </v>

2934
02:12:18.111 --> 02:12:22.310
<v Speaker 5>parts of the world that must behave a </v>
<v Speaker 5>way different way than we are allowed to</v>

2935
02:12:22.311 --> 02:12:23.144
<v Speaker 5>behave because they're entrapped in a </v>
<v Speaker 5>religious ideology that dominates their </v>

2936
02:12:26.541 --> 02:12:30.650
<v Speaker 5>community,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so it could be these poor kids in Africa</v>

2937
02:12:30.651 --> 02:12:31.484
<v Speaker 5>that get that female genital mutilation,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like how many of them haven't done to </v>

2938
02:12:35.181 --> 02:12:36.014
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It could be that it could be growing up </v>

2939
02:12:38.080 --> 02:12:38.913
<v Speaker 5>Mormon and Utah and a crazy fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>house filled with nutty mormons or you </v>

2940
02:12:42.651 --> 02:12:43.484
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a million different </v>

2941
02:12:44.180 --> 02:12:46.670
<v Speaker 5>possibilities.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Roll the dice that you ended up there,</v>

2942
02:12:46.700 --> 02:12:50.330
<v Speaker 5>but apparently people are just super </v>
<v Speaker 5>flexible.</v>

2943
02:12:50.840 --> 02:12:51.673
<v Speaker 5>Our behavior is really malleable and </v>
<v Speaker 5>were adaptable and we can fit into </v>

2944
02:12:58.340 --> 02:13:01.160
<v Speaker 5>whether it's a horrible ideology like </v>
<v Speaker 5>what happened,</v>

2945
02:13:03.170 --> 02:13:05.330
<v Speaker 5>what happened in World War II,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what happened with the Nazis.</v>

2946
02:13:05.810 --> 02:13:09.710
<v Speaker 5>They fail into a horrible way of of </v>
<v Speaker 5>living life,</v>

2947
02:13:10.690 --> 02:13:14.720
<v Speaker 5>but that's a possibility that's going on</v>
<v Speaker 5>right now in North Korea.</v>

2948
02:13:14.930 --> 02:13:15.763
<v Speaker 5>There's always a possibility for people </v>
<v Speaker 5>to fit into these little weird little </v>

2949
02:13:19.371 --> 02:13:20.204
<v Speaker 5>packages.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So if you see someone that has a weird </v>

2950
02:13:22.340 --> 02:13:24.950
<v Speaker 5>package of existence that you don't jive</v>
<v Speaker 5>with,</v>

2951
02:13:25.580 --> 02:13:29.540
<v Speaker 5>you gotta look at it like what would you</v>
<v Speaker 5>do if you were them?</v>

2952
02:13:29.790 --> 02:13:33.740
<v Speaker 5>Like if you had their life and now </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're looking at this from their but no</v>

2953
02:13:33.741 --> 02:13:35.970
<v Speaker 5>one from your perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Try.</v>

2954
02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:38.850
<v Speaker 5>If you can do imagine what it would be </v>
<v Speaker 5>like to look at it from.</v>

2955
02:13:38.860 --> 02:13:39.490
<v Speaker 5>There's,</v>

2956
02:13:39.490 --> 02:13:40.990
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so random it.</v>

2957
02:13:41.260 --> 02:13:43.240
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially like growing up here,</v>

2958
02:13:43.300 --> 02:13:44.133
<v Speaker 3>it's like you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you had been born just 200 miles </v>

2959
02:13:49.241 --> 02:13:52.060
<v Speaker 3>south in Mexico,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your life is.</v>

2960
02:13:52.090 --> 02:13:53.680
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>totally different.</v>

2961
02:13:53.740 --> 02:13:55.930
<v Speaker 3>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's no like,</v>

2962
02:13:55.990 --> 02:13:56.823
<v Speaker 3>divine the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just you just got lucky that your </v>

2963
02:13:59.231 --> 02:14:01.840
<v Speaker 3>parents ended up a little north.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2964
02:14:01.841 --> 02:14:03.730
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>

2965
02:14:03.731 --> 02:14:04.990
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really,</v>

2966
02:14:04.991 --> 02:14:06.520
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really unsettling.</v>

2967
02:14:06.820 --> 02:14:07.653
<v Speaker 5>It's unsettling.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's one of the worst parts about </v>

2968
02:14:10.230 --> 02:14:14.350
<v Speaker 5>the really simple build that wall,</v>
<v Speaker 5>build that wall,</v>

2969
02:14:14.590 --> 02:14:17.290
<v Speaker 5>build that wall,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that really simple sentiment.</v>

2970
02:14:17.710 --> 02:14:20.120
<v Speaker 5>There's a problem with that man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's different</v>

2971
02:14:20.340 --> 02:14:21.173
<v Speaker 3>between pride in what you are and having</v>
<v Speaker 3>an enemy to that you need this enemy to </v>

2972
02:14:25.861 --> 02:14:27.210
<v Speaker 3>take people down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I mean,</v>

2973
02:14:27.220 --> 02:14:27.950
<v Speaker 3>that's the way</v>

2974
02:14:27.950 --> 02:14:28.850
<v Speaker 5>saying before,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

2975
02:14:28.851 --> 02:14:30.770
<v Speaker 5>it's like you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you're expressing fear,</v>

2976
02:14:30.890 --> 02:14:33.260
<v Speaker 5>you're going to get a pushback.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you're expressing anger,</v>

2977
02:14:33.380 --> 02:14:34.570
<v Speaker 5>you're going to get a push,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2978
02:14:34.730 --> 02:14:36.560
<v Speaker 5>If all of a sudden you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>build a wall,</v>

2979
02:14:36.680 --> 02:14:37.513
<v Speaker 5>build a wall.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That seems to me to be a place that I </v>

2980
02:14:39.291 --> 02:14:40.530
<v Speaker 5>want to get in now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

2981
02:14:40.960 --> 02:14:41.793
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and if you're a person who wants to do </v>

2982
02:14:43.461 --> 02:14:46.730
<v Speaker 5>something bad,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's the spot that's way more evil now</v>

2983
02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:49.220
<v Speaker 5>because now you've got a big crazy wall,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2984
02:14:49.360 --> 02:14:54.360
<v Speaker 5>Like there's gotta be some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 5>recognition that will almost like it has</v>

2985
02:14:56.181 --> 02:14:57.014
<v Speaker 5>to come from the top.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It seems like it has to be this size to </v>

2986
02:14:58.941 --> 02:15:02.450
<v Speaker 5>be some sort of recognition that look </v>
<v Speaker 5>the reality of our existence here.</v>

2987
02:15:02.451 --> 02:15:06.590
<v Speaker 5>So we're extremely fortunate in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>reality of other people's existences.</v>

2988
02:15:06.620 --> 02:15:11.090
<v Speaker 5>They got terrible luck that this is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is an undeniable reality of babies.</v>

2989
02:15:11.120 --> 02:15:12.920
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One hundred percent of the time,</v>

2990
02:15:13.130 --> 02:15:15.530
<v Speaker 5>all over the world right now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>baby worked hard to get where they are.</v>

2991
02:15:15.950 --> 02:15:18.110
<v Speaker 5>It just showed up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Roll the dice.</v>

2992
02:15:18.140 --> 02:15:21.170
<v Speaker 5>He might have the right body.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're in Manhattan.</v>

2993
02:15:21.190 --> 02:15:22.520
<v Speaker 5>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>here's my mom.</v>

2994
02:15:22.610 --> 02:15:25.700
<v Speaker 5>Where are we live in Tribeca,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this great Italian restaurants here,</v>

2995
02:15:25.850 --> 02:15:26.683
<v Speaker 5>good schools.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What a great place to grow up and my </v>

2996
02:15:28.320 --> 02:15:31.610
<v Speaker 5>onesy it's made of so lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God,</v>

2997
02:15:31.611 --> 02:15:32.680
<v Speaker 5>this is great.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2998
02:15:32.681 --> 02:15:33.514
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the difference between that and </v>

2999
02:15:34.221 --> 02:15:37.100
<v Speaker 5>being born in a hut in the Congo,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3000
02:15:37.110 --> 02:15:38.780
<v Speaker 5>I mean you just got lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3001
02:15:39.050 --> 02:15:41.540
<v Speaker 5>So that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Build the wall,</v>

3002
02:15:41.720 --> 02:15:44.510
<v Speaker 5>build a wall.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I get where you're coming from.</v>

3003
02:15:44.511 --> 02:15:46.820
<v Speaker 5>I understand the motivation to think </v>
<v Speaker 5>like that,</v>

3004
02:15:46.910 --> 02:15:50.660
<v Speaker 5>but I really pretty firmly believed that</v>
<v Speaker 5>anytime you put something like that out,</v>

3005
02:15:50.840 --> 02:15:52.920
<v Speaker 5>you'd get something like that that comes</v>
<v Speaker 5>back at.</v>

3006
02:15:53.640 --> 02:15:58.640
<v Speaker 3>It's anything that has a little hate on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the edges.</v>

3007
02:15:59.250 --> 02:16:00.083
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of people like that guy </v>

3008
02:16:01.690 --> 02:16:03.300
<v Speaker 3>you say in that video and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're just,</v>

3009
02:16:03.390 --> 02:16:05.730
<v Speaker 3>it's an aggressive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3010
02:16:05.820 --> 02:16:07.320
<v Speaker 3>Fuck yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we got it.</v>

3011
02:16:07.350 --> 02:16:08.910
<v Speaker 3>We want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is our guy.</v>

3012
02:16:09.170 --> 02:16:11.340
<v Speaker 3>Here we come.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Scary.</v>

3013
02:16:11.370 --> 02:16:12.420
<v Speaker 3>Scary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never been in A.</v>

3014
02:16:12.510 --> 02:16:14.050
<v Speaker 3>I've never lived.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3015
02:16:14.070 --> 02:16:16.860
<v Speaker 3>I haven't been here that long,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's never been after an election</v>

3016
02:16:16.861 --> 02:16:19.440
<v Speaker 3>where large groups of people were </v>
<v Speaker 3>scared.</v>

3017
02:16:19.940 --> 02:16:21.540
<v Speaker 3>That's never happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Unhappy,</v>

3018
02:16:21.930 --> 02:16:22.763
<v Speaker 3>pissed off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't believe they're going to do </v>

3019
02:16:23.881 --> 02:16:24.714
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that that assholes in office never has </v>

3020
02:16:27.601 --> 02:16:28.434
<v Speaker 3>there been large groups of families </v>
<v Speaker 3>really legitimately frightened of our </v>

3021
02:16:34.151 --> 02:16:35.860
<v Speaker 3>leader.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's never happened.</v>

3022
02:16:36.300 --> 02:16:39.690
<v Speaker 5>I feel like Bill Clinton should just </v>
<v Speaker 5>step up and just say,</v>

3023
02:16:40.230 --> 02:16:45.230
<v Speaker 5>this is why we always rigged the system.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're trying to avoid this.</v>

3024
02:16:45.930 --> 02:16:46.763
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're protecting you from your own </v>

3025
02:16:48.091 --> 02:16:52.530
<v Speaker 5>selves are a ridiculous desire to have </v>
<v Speaker 5>famous people live.</v>

3026
02:16:53.220 --> 02:16:54.720
<v Speaker 5>Congratulations.</v>

3027
02:16:56.270 --> 02:16:58.490
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was rigged for a reason.</v>

3028
02:17:01.740 --> 02:17:04.620
<v Speaker 5>Greatest nickname for trump.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Somebody called them.</v>

3029
02:17:04.621 --> 02:17:06.380
<v Speaker 5>Cheeto Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3030
02:17:06.570 --> 02:17:07.660
<v Speaker 5>I've been using cheeto</v>

3031
02:17:07.830 --> 02:17:12.480
<v Speaker 3>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3032
02:17:12.830 --> 02:17:14.540
<v Speaker 3>On election night,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was really upsetting.</v>

3033
02:17:14.541 --> 02:17:15.374
<v Speaker 3>My was it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My daughter was as a 14 year old girl </v>

3034
02:17:17.900 --> 02:17:20.390
<v Speaker 3>who just heard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's smart.</v>

3035
02:17:20.630 --> 02:17:21.463
<v Speaker 3>She's a high school freshmen and just </v>
<v Speaker 3>heard what this guy was saying about </v>

3036
02:17:26.001 --> 02:17:28.520
<v Speaker 3>women and just heard what he was saying </v>
<v Speaker 3>about,</v>

3037
02:17:28.960 --> 02:17:31.130
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>handicaps or whatever.</v>

3038
02:17:31.200 --> 02:17:32.280
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that hand up thing.</v>

3039
02:17:32.310 --> 02:17:36.690
<v Speaker 5>Did you know that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That that I'm not giving them an excuse,</v>

3040
02:17:36.691 --> 02:17:39.120
<v Speaker 5>but I don't think he knew that that guy </v>
<v Speaker 5>was handicapped.</v>

3041
02:17:39.360 --> 02:17:43.290
<v Speaker 5>I think he was trying to mock someone </v>
<v Speaker 5>who was dumb and he.</v>

3042
02:17:43.390 --> 02:17:44.223
<v Speaker 5>It turned out that the person who was </v>
<v Speaker 5>mocking was handicapped and that's what </v>

3043
02:17:46.411 --> 02:17:47.244
<v Speaker 5>everybody rent one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't believe he had any knowledge of </v>

3044
02:17:49.111 --> 02:17:50.250
<v Speaker 5>that beforehand.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think it was.</v>

3045
02:17:50.530 --> 02:17:52.570
<v Speaker 3>I'll give you that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but even if he didn't know it,</v>

3046
02:17:52.571 --> 02:17:55.510
<v Speaker 3>to make that gesture and act like that </v>
<v Speaker 3>guy is just dumb.</v>

3047
02:17:55.511 --> 02:17:58.230
<v Speaker 3>Like as a guy running for president,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just was.</v>

3048
02:17:58.280 --> 02:17:59.350
<v Speaker 3>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a bully.</v>

3049
02:17:59.351 --> 02:18:00.184
<v Speaker 3>It was a bullyish move.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whether the guy's handicapped or not </v>

3050
02:18:02.050 --> 02:18:04.030
<v Speaker 3>handing the girls not handing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well he,</v>

3051
02:18:04.031 --> 02:18:04.910
<v Speaker 3>I think he just that</v>

3052
02:18:05.190 --> 02:18:08.040
<v Speaker 5>combative relationships like that or a </v>
<v Speaker 5>contest.</v>

3053
02:18:08.041 --> 02:18:08.874
<v Speaker 5>It's a war and he,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he'll go out then with his personality </v>

3054
02:18:11.520 --> 02:18:12.870
<v Speaker 5>and that's what's odd for us.</v>

3055
02:18:13.010 --> 02:18:15.170
<v Speaker 3>And it's from a president,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3056
02:18:15.380 --> 02:18:16.220
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no.</v>

3057
02:18:16.221 --> 02:18:18.380
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So my daughter was just crying.</v>

3058
02:18:18.530 --> 02:18:19.840
<v Speaker 3>She was just crying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's like,</v>

3059
02:18:19.850 --> 02:18:22.940
<v Speaker 3>so a guy that says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>grab your pussy is now my president.</v>

3060
02:18:22.941 --> 02:18:25.280
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this doesn't make sense.</v>

3061
02:18:25.520 --> 02:18:27.380
<v Speaker 3>This guy that says global warming is a </v>
<v Speaker 3>hoax.</v>

3062
02:18:27.381 --> 02:18:29.810
<v Speaker 3>This doesn't make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did he really say that?</v>

3063
02:18:29.960 --> 02:18:32.030
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You said global warming is a hoax,</v>

3064
02:18:32.060 --> 02:18:35.940
<v Speaker 3>a hoax created by the Chinese.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she's really fucking said that.</v>

3065
02:18:36.740 --> 02:18:38.000
<v Speaker 3>And she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's like,</v>

3066
02:18:38.001 --> 02:18:39.230
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just,</v>

3067
02:18:39.260 --> 02:18:42.140
<v Speaker 3>what the hell just happened?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought he was just skeptical.</v>

3068
02:18:42.350 --> 02:18:44.000
<v Speaker 5>I thought he was just skeptical about </v>
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

3069
02:18:44.030 --> 02:18:44.863
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

3070
02:18:44.870 --> 02:18:47.420
<v Speaker 5>Influence global warming because that's </v>
<v Speaker 5>what they like to call it.</v>

3071
02:18:47.421 --> 02:18:48.290
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Influenced.</v>

3072
02:18:48.380 --> 02:18:49.540
<v Speaker 5>Influenced.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3073
02:18:50.150 --> 02:18:50.983
<v Speaker 5>Have you ever seen like the ice core </v>
<v Speaker 5>samples of like what the earth used to </v>

3074
02:18:53.811 --> 02:18:56.470
<v Speaker 5>be like just a few,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3075
02:18:56.680 --> 02:18:57.890
<v Speaker 5>few,</v>

3076
02:18:57.891 --> 02:18:58.790
<v Speaker 5>20,000</v>
<v Speaker 5>years ago.</v>

3077
02:18:59.480 --> 02:19:00.520
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The,</v>

3078
02:19:00.690 --> 02:19:01.523
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the ice levels rise and the sea levels </v>

3079
02:19:04.791 --> 02:19:09.230
<v Speaker 5>rise and like the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is a constantly changing topography</v>

3080
02:19:09.530 --> 02:19:12.910
<v Speaker 5>and the like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the natural shifts in the earth cycle.</v>

3081
02:19:12.911 --> 02:19:14.840
<v Speaker 5>And I'm not a climate change denier at </v>
<v Speaker 5>all.</v>

3082
02:19:14.841 --> 02:19:15.674
<v Speaker 5>Ladies and gentlemen,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let me just get this out because if you </v>

3083
02:19:16.491 --> 02:19:18.620
<v Speaker 5>talk about this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people just get angry and a hair trigger</v>

3084
02:19:18.621 --> 02:19:19.670
<v Speaker 5>word.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not what I'm saying.</v>

3085
02:19:19.671 --> 02:19:20.240
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3086
02:19:20.240 --> 02:19:22.040
<v Speaker 5>I absolutely believe that we're fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>up this planet.</v>

3087
02:19:22.041 --> 02:19:23.030
<v Speaker 5>That's not what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3088
02:19:23.300 --> 02:19:26.300
<v Speaker 5>But without us doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just without us doing that,</v>

3089
02:19:26.330 --> 02:19:31.330
<v Speaker 5>there's been a constant cycle of change,</v>
<v Speaker 5>violent place and it's sometimes really,</v>

3090
02:19:31.491 --> 02:19:32.324
<v Speaker 5>really radical,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like giant shifts of temperature up and </v>

3091
02:19:35.211 --> 02:19:36.044
<v Speaker 5>down.</v>

3092
02:19:36.170 --> 02:19:38.810
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the big one being the ice age,</v>

3093
02:19:38.811 --> 02:19:39.644
<v Speaker 5>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that we can measure fairly recently </v>

3094
02:19:42.470 --> 02:19:45.050
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>most of this country was covered up by a</v>

3095
02:19:45.050 --> 02:19:46.790
<v Speaker 5>mile to two miles.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have ice,</v>

3096
02:19:46.850 --> 02:19:48.800
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Miles.</v>

3097
02:19:48.860 --> 02:19:49.940
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So what's your point?</v>

3098
02:19:50.480 --> 02:19:54.200
<v Speaker 5>My point is this whole place is super </v>
<v Speaker 5>volatile.</v>

3099
02:19:54.620 --> 02:19:55.453
<v Speaker 5>I mean this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for him to say that global warming is a </v>

3100
02:19:57.261 --> 02:19:59.420
<v Speaker 5>hoax.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's coming.</v>

3101
02:19:59.720 --> 02:20:01.220
<v Speaker 5>It's coming with a.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You did it.</v>

3102
02:20:01.221 --> 02:20:02.054
<v Speaker 5>I did it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If it's happening or the concept of </v>

3103
02:20:03.861 --> 02:20:04.694
<v Speaker 5>global warming was created by and for </v>
<v Speaker 5>the Chinese in order to make us </v>

3104
02:20:07.551 --> 02:20:11.000
<v Speaker 5>manufacturing noncompetitive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>November of 2012.</v>

3105
02:20:11.120 --> 02:20:11.953
<v Speaker 5>See,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he was probably one of those dudes that </v>

3106
02:20:13.401 --> 02:20:14.870
<v Speaker 5>believed in the Mayan calendar.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She's like,</v>

3107
02:20:14.871 --> 02:20:15.704
<v Speaker 5>fuck it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to say some crazy shit before </v>

3108
02:20:16.971 --> 02:20:19.040
<v Speaker 5>December 20,</v>
<v Speaker 5>first 2012,</v>

3109
02:20:21.380 --> 02:20:23.060
<v Speaker 5>it'll all be done.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was,</v>

3110
02:20:23.070 --> 02:20:24.070
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that was,</v>

3111
02:20:24.071 --> 02:20:24.904
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>something that people were saying back </v>

3112
02:20:25.551 --> 02:20:27.050
<v Speaker 5>then too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was a popular.</v>

3113
02:20:27.051 --> 02:20:27.884
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he used to say a bunch of crazy shit </v>

3114
02:20:29.031 --> 02:20:29.864
<v Speaker 5>though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Remember he used to say that Obama was </v>

3115
02:20:31.160 --> 02:20:31.993
<v Speaker 5>born in Kenya.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was a truth or a birth or rather he </v>

3116
02:20:33.801 --> 02:20:35.120
<v Speaker 5>was the birther.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3117
02:20:35.121 --> 02:20:36.740
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he was the leader of that.</v>

3118
02:20:37.220 --> 02:20:40.400
<v Speaker 5>He would go and do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but see you gotta wonder,</v>

3119
02:20:40.401 --> 02:20:42.500
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how much of that is showmanship?</v>

3120
02:20:43.010 --> 02:20:43.940
<v Speaker 3>How much day?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

3121
02:20:43.941 --> 02:20:44.774
<v Speaker 3>I feel like we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like it's the Chauncey Gardner </v>

3122
02:20:46.131 --> 02:20:46.970
<v Speaker 3>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3123
02:20:46.971 --> 02:20:47.600
<v Speaker 3>from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3124
02:20:47.600 --> 02:20:49.620
<v Speaker 3>when Peter Sellers became president,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3125
02:20:49.670 --> 02:20:51.070
<v Speaker 3>He was like the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

3126
02:20:51.620 --> 02:20:52.453
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3127
02:20:52.690 --> 02:20:53.780
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>being there,</v>

3128
02:20:54.890 --> 02:20:57.590
<v Speaker 3>being there and it was just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was the gardener.</v>

3129
02:20:57.591 --> 02:20:58.630
<v Speaker 3>He just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he had,</v>

3130
02:20:58.760 --> 02:21:02.970
<v Speaker 3>he was very simple and people just made </v>
<v Speaker 3>it ultimately made him president.</v>

3131
02:21:02.971 --> 02:21:03.804
<v Speaker 3>He just kind of wandered into the </v>
<v Speaker 3>presidency and I feel like that with </v>

3132
02:21:06.951 --> 02:21:07.784
<v Speaker 3>trump,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like he wandered in and now </v>

3133
02:21:09.711 --> 02:21:10.970
<v Speaker 3>people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3134
02:21:11.000 --> 02:21:14.450
<v Speaker 3>are these tweets genius or is he trying </v>
<v Speaker 3>to manipulate us?</v>

3135
02:21:14.510 --> 02:21:17.090
<v Speaker 3>Is huge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really intelligent is a really this,</v>

3136
02:21:17.420 --> 02:21:19.880
<v Speaker 3>I think he just usually is what he is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3137
02:21:19.881 --> 02:21:23.090
<v Speaker 3>I don't think I would believe very </v>
<v Speaker 3>talented,</v>

3138
02:21:23.091 --> 02:21:25.650
<v Speaker 3>very charismatic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

3139
02:21:25.920 --> 02:21:27.500
<v Speaker 3>rich's fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>richest fuck.</v>

3140
02:21:27.501 --> 02:21:30.770
<v Speaker 3>He's got a good sense of timing and </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff like that,</v>

3141
02:21:30.771 --> 02:21:33.470
<v Speaker 3>but balling out of control.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of this empty vessel.</v>

3142
02:21:33.471 --> 02:21:34.270
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

3143
02:21:34.270 --> 02:21:36.470
<v Speaker 3>the big shore though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3144
02:21:36.471 --> 02:21:37.304
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty sure when you hear him talk </v>

3145
02:21:39.051 --> 02:21:39.884
<v Speaker 3>about different things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he doesn't really know about a lot of </v>

3146
02:21:41.841 --> 02:21:43.730
<v Speaker 3>different types.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Home alone I did.</v>

3147
02:21:43.760 --> 02:21:44.900
<v Speaker 3>He was on the marriage riff.</v>

3148
02:21:46.370 --> 02:21:47.203
<v Speaker 5>It did</v>

3149
02:21:47.630 --> 02:21:49.370
<v Speaker 3>right next door.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was right there.</v>

3150
02:21:49.400 --> 02:21:51.400
<v Speaker 3>He would make comments about make </v>
<v Speaker 3>comments.</v>

3151
02:21:51.710 --> 02:21:53.870
<v Speaker 3>It was all about husbands and wives.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You would,</v>

3152
02:21:53.871 --> 02:21:54.704
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>show a real husband and wife and then </v>

3153
02:21:55.491 --> 02:21:56.324
<v Speaker 3>you'd talk about them in these.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You try and decide who's right and the </v>

3154
02:21:58.521 --> 02:21:59.354
<v Speaker 3>argument,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the husband and the wife and all of his </v>

3155
02:22:00.801 --> 02:22:05.170
<v Speaker 3>jokes were about the women's breasts who</v>
<v Speaker 3>said all of his jokes were about the,</v>

3156
02:22:05.720 --> 02:22:07.250
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's got these big things,</v>

3157
02:22:07.251 --> 02:22:08.300
<v Speaker 3>so she's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she'll be okay.</v>

3158
02:22:08.301 --> 02:22:10.160
<v Speaker 3>And then he would turn to me and give me</v>
<v Speaker 3>a wink,</v>

3159
02:22:10.940 --> 02:22:12.620
<v Speaker 3>like not for the camera,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not for anything,</v>

3160
02:22:12.621 --> 02:22:15.170
<v Speaker 3>just me on the side was just kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>wink at me.</v>

3161
02:22:15.171 --> 02:22:16.670
<v Speaker 3>Like we're doing great here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3162
02:22:17.000 --> 02:22:20.890
<v Speaker 3>I felt like it this way before I knew </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything about him running or anything,</v>

3163
02:22:20.891 --> 02:22:21.750
<v Speaker 3>it was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ooh,</v>

3164
02:22:22.650 --> 02:22:23.483
<v Speaker 3>scheming me out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I felt like I was date raped on my own </v>

3165
02:22:25.110 --> 02:22:25.943
<v Speaker 3>show,</v>

3166
02:22:27.810 --> 02:22:29.730
<v Speaker 1>but he walked in during that show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like,</v>

3167
02:22:29.850 --> 02:22:31.680
<v Speaker 1>we're gonna do great ratings tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to do great.</v>

3168
02:22:31.710 --> 02:22:33.100

<v Speaker 1>We're going to do great rating.</v>

3169
02:22:33.101 --> 02:22:34.320
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was always that way.</v>

3170
02:22:34.350 --> 02:22:36.120
<v Speaker 1>Just mantra the mantra,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mantra.</v>

3171
02:22:36.420 --> 02:22:38.520
<v Speaker 1>I think I would be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3172
02:22:38.730 --> 02:22:41.880
<v Speaker 1>I would take it in like it was a show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would think I'd be psyched.</v>

3173
02:22:42.420 --> 02:22:44.190
<v Speaker 1>I'd be psyched to sit next to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3187
02:23:10.651 --> 02:23:11.484

<v Speaker 1>The word trump is worth so much more </v>

3199
02:23:46.121 --> 02:23:47.020
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

3200
02:23:47.021 --> 02:23:48.340
<v Speaker 1>It's one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3201
02:23:48.400 --> 02:23:50.740
<v Speaker 1>and that's all he wanted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how do you not.</v>

3202
02:23:51.430 --> 02:23:52.600
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you.</v>

3203
02:23:52.690 --> 02:23:54.850
<v Speaker 1>I can't pull away now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've made it.</v>

3204
02:23:54.880 --> 02:23:56.980
<v Speaker 1>This is the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is when we take over the planet.</v>

3205
02:23:57.610 --> 02:23:59.860
<v Speaker 5>I don't remember who had the original </v>
<v Speaker 5>thought,</v>

3206
02:23:59.861 --> 02:24:01.510
<v Speaker 5>but I agree with this thought.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not Mine,</v>

3207
02:24:01.630 --> 02:24:06.550
<v Speaker 5>my thought originally,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that what is interesting about trump</v>

3208
02:24:06.940 --> 02:24:11.260
<v Speaker 5>is that he cares so much about how </v>
<v Speaker 5>people like him.</v>

3209
02:24:11.500 --> 02:24:14.560
<v Speaker 5>So because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the will of the people,</v>

3210
02:24:14.950 --> 02:24:18.640
<v Speaker 5>whether it's marijuana or whether it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever it is,</v>

3211
02:24:18.641 --> 02:24:19.474
<v Speaker 5>maybe it's nonviolent drug offenders </v>
<v Speaker 5>that have been in jail forever for no </v>

3212
02:24:22.211 --> 02:24:24.190
<v Speaker 5>fucking reason.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That makes any sense to anybody now that</v>

3213
02:24:24.191 --> 02:24:25.024
<v Speaker 5>were the.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you take and you put someone into Ge </v>

3214
02:24:26.650 --> 02:24:27.483
<v Speaker 5>in jail for life in 1975 for marijuana </v>
<v Speaker 5>because they smoked marijuana in Las </v>

3215
02:24:31.270 --> 02:24:33.960
<v Speaker 5>Vegas,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that a person person's still in jail.</v>

3216
02:24:33.970 --> 02:24:35.410
<v Speaker 5>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you're,</v>

3217
02:24:35.470 --> 02:24:36.880
<v Speaker 5>you're the president now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Mr Trump,</v>

3218
02:24:36.881 --> 02:24:39.040
<v Speaker 5>please let them out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Please just,</v>

3219
02:24:39.041 --> 02:24:39.910
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's find,</v>

3220
02:24:39.940 --> 02:24:41.470
<v Speaker 5>let's find a way to get these people </v>
<v Speaker 5>jobs.</v>

3221
02:24:41.740 --> 02:24:42.573
<v Speaker 5>They weren't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they weren't arrested because what they </v>

3222
02:24:44.591 --> 02:24:45.424
<v Speaker 5>did was wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They were arrested because there was a </v>

3223
02:24:47.591 --> 02:24:50.470
<v Speaker 5>thing written down on a piece of paper </v>
<v Speaker 5>that said it was wrong.</v>

3224
02:24:50.710 --> 02:24:51.543
<v Speaker 5>It's not really wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's nothing wrong with what they </v>

3225
02:24:53.171 --> 02:24:54.004
<v Speaker 5>did.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just because it was written on a piece </v>

3226
02:24:55.511 --> 02:24:56.890
<v Speaker 5>of paper doesn't mean we should honor </v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

3227
02:24:57.070 --> 02:24:59.560
<v Speaker 5>So many years later when we would never </v>
<v Speaker 5>act accordingly,</v>

3228
02:24:59.740 --> 02:25:02.890
<v Speaker 5>you would never know the fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No one in this country is going to go to</v>

3229
02:25:02.891 --> 02:25:04.570
<v Speaker 5>jail for the rest of their life because </v>
<v Speaker 5>they have a joint,</v>

3230
02:25:04.760 --> 02:25:08.800
<v Speaker 5>but isn't it entirely possible that </v>
<v Speaker 5>someone in this country has gone to jail</v>

3231
02:25:08.890 --> 02:25:10.270
<v Speaker 5>for the rest of their life?</v>
<v Speaker 5>For a joint?</v>

3232
02:25:10.271 --> 02:25:11.104
<v Speaker 5>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Especially if you get inside and then </v>

3233
02:25:12.491 --> 02:25:13.960
<v Speaker 5>all of a sudden you get in a fight in </v>
<v Speaker 5>jail,</v>

3234
02:25:14.260 --> 02:25:15.093
<v Speaker 5>which happens all the time and someone </v>
<v Speaker 5>dies and you wind up getting charged </v>

3235
02:25:17.081 --> 02:25:17.914
<v Speaker 5>with murder.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean that kind of stuff happens to </v>

3236
02:25:19.181 --> 02:25:20.014
<v Speaker 5>people over a nonsense bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Arrests aren't most people jail because </v>

3237
02:25:23.801 --> 02:25:24.550
<v Speaker 5>of</v>

3238
02:25:24.550 --> 02:25:25.950
<v Speaker 3>drug related.</v>

3239
02:25:26.030 --> 02:25:26.863
<v Speaker 5>We just pulled it up the other day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was like 46 percent nonviolent drug </v>

3240
02:25:30.231 --> 02:25:31.940
<v Speaker 5>offenders.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Forty six percent in jail.</v>

3241
02:25:32.230 --> 02:25:33.640
<v Speaker 3>It's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's insane,</v>

3242
02:25:33.730 --> 02:25:35.020
<v Speaker 3>but the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you say,</v>

3243
02:25:35.130 --> 02:25:38.350
<v Speaker 3>he wants to be popular and he wants to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be well liked in all.</v>

3244
02:25:39.040 --> 02:25:39.873
<v Speaker 3>The thing we're going to find out is on </v>
<v Speaker 3>what level does is he looking for that </v>

3245
02:25:43.511 --> 02:25:44.344
<v Speaker 3>approval?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it from the masses saying this stuff </v>

3246
02:25:46.510 --> 02:25:50.710
<v Speaker 3>or is it the guy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The last guy that came in is it sessions</v>

3247
02:25:50.711 --> 02:25:53.170
<v Speaker 3>that comes in and says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that we should,</v>

3248
02:25:53.620 --> 02:25:56.410
<v Speaker 3>we should go this way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he wants to get earned.</v>

3249
02:25:56.411 --> 02:25:57.244
<v Speaker 3>The respect of that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you have a lot of forces coming in </v>

3250
02:26:00.730 --> 02:26:01.563
<v Speaker 3>that we didn't vote for that are going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be controlling a lot because he's </v>

3251
02:26:04.301 --> 02:26:06.250
<v Speaker 3>going to be just kind of delegating it </v>
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>

3252
02:26:06.251 --> 02:26:09.460
<v Speaker 3>We don't really know where he stands.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the most scary thing is that it's</v>

3253
02:26:09.461 --> 02:26:10.294
<v Speaker 3>kind of unknowable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't know how much in control he is </v>

3254
02:26:13.301 --> 02:26:14.134
<v Speaker 3>going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are these other people going to come in </v>

3255
02:26:14.831 --> 02:26:17.170
<v Speaker 3>and fill that vacuum and they're going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be in control.</v>

3256
02:26:17.860 --> 02:26:22.210
<v Speaker 5>Big argument against the NDA,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the national defense.</v>

3257
02:26:22.240 --> 02:26:24.830
<v Speaker 5>What are the National Defense </v>
<v Speaker 5>Authorization Act that with the NDA,</v>

3258
02:26:25.210 --> 02:26:26.043
<v Speaker 5>that was the one that allowed for </v>
<v Speaker 5>indefinite detainment don't need a </v>

3259
02:26:29.051 --> 02:26:29.884
<v Speaker 5>warrant.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can just arrest people and detain </v>

3260
02:26:32.201 --> 02:26:35.110
<v Speaker 5>them indefinitely without.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They don't have to have a speedy trial.</v>

3261
02:26:35.350 --> 02:26:38.230
<v Speaker 5>The right to a speedy trial has been </v>
<v Speaker 5>revoked and everybody was like,</v>

3262
02:26:38.231 --> 02:26:39.064
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's fine because Obama is not going </v>

3263
02:26:39.551 --> 02:26:41.560
<v Speaker 5>to use that one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then the question was like,</v>

3264
02:26:41.561 --> 02:26:43.270
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Obama might not be using it,</v>

3265
02:26:43.300 --> 02:26:46.420
<v Speaker 5>but what happens if a new president gets</v>
<v Speaker 5>into office and he's crazy?</v>

3266
02:26:46.610 --> 02:26:47.680
<v Speaker 5>Everyone's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't worry,</v>

3267
02:26:47.681 --> 02:26:49.240
<v Speaker 5>that's not going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well guess what?</v>

3268
02:26:49.270 --> 02:26:50.103
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you fucked up so that Donald Trump has </v>

3269
02:26:52.181 --> 02:26:54.070
<v Speaker 5>the n,</v>
<v Speaker 5>d a on his side.</v>

3270
02:26:54.071 --> 02:26:54.910
<v Speaker 5>He can use it now</v>

3271
02:26:55.110 --> 02:26:55.943
<v Speaker 3>and add to that and incident.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Add to that some kind of nine slash 11 </v>

3272
02:27:01.170 --> 02:27:02.790
<v Speaker 3>and then he really takes advantage of </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

3273
02:27:02.800 --> 02:27:04.000
<v Speaker 5>You never know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You never know.</v>

3274
02:27:04.030 --> 02:27:04.863
<v Speaker 5>You never know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One thing that should be taken into </v>

3275
02:27:06.881 --> 02:27:07.714
<v Speaker 5>consideration though is that he's a </v>
<v Speaker 5>businessman and one of the things about </v>

3276
02:27:10.270 --> 02:27:14.530
<v Speaker 5>things like legalizing marijuana or </v>
<v Speaker 5>going against legalized marijuana,</v>

3277
02:27:14.860 --> 02:27:15.693
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't make sense from a business </v>
<v Speaker 5>standpoint because there's too many of </v>

3278
02:27:19.481 --> 02:27:22.390
<v Speaker 5>us that smoke it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like Jamie put up the numbers.</v>

3279
02:27:22.510 --> 02:27:24.340
<v Speaker 5>What percentage,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's just say Tom,</v>

3280
02:27:24.370 --> 02:27:25.203
<v Speaker 5>papa,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what percentage of Americans do you </v>

3281
02:27:27.011 --> 02:27:28.180
<v Speaker 5>think smoke marijuana?</v>

3282
02:27:28.500 --> 02:27:32.520
<v Speaker 3>What percentage of adult Americans smoke</v>
<v Speaker 3>marijuana?</v>

3283
02:27:32.521 --> 02:27:36.690
<v Speaker 3>I would put it at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to put it like smoke it on the</v>

3284
02:27:36.691 --> 02:27:39.240
<v Speaker 3>regular,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so once a month.</v>

3285
02:27:39.300 --> 02:27:40.890
<v Speaker 3>More than once a month.</v>
<v Speaker 3>More than once a month.</v>

3286
02:27:40.891 --> 02:27:45.720
<v Speaker 3>I would say that that number is at 46 </v>
<v Speaker 3>percent.</v>

3287
02:27:46.150 --> 02:27:48.640
<v Speaker 5>I bet you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was gonna go in the forties to.</v>

3288
02:27:48.641 --> 02:27:50.410
<v Speaker 5>I was going to say like 43.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3289
02:27:50.590 --> 02:27:53.140
<v Speaker 5>but I think 46 rang in my head too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3290
02:27:53.320 --> 02:27:55.120
<v Speaker 5>that's a good number.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think you're dead on.</v>

3291
02:27:56.460 --> 02:27:58.460
<v Speaker 3>That's what I would guess.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's hard static.</v>

3292
02:27:58.470 --> 02:28:01.380
<v Speaker 3>Find maybe Halep poll.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gallup polls are bullshit.</v>

3293
02:28:02.110 --> 02:28:02.943
<v Speaker 3>Let's go with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyway.</v>

3294
02:28:02.980 --> 02:28:05.720
<v Speaker 3>Was it says one in eight US adults say </v>
<v Speaker 3>they smoke</v>

3295
02:28:05.780 --> 02:28:07.160
<v Speaker 5>marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How dare they?</v>

3296
02:28:07.490 --> 02:28:10.070
<v Speaker 5>One in eight people dumb enough to </v>
<v Speaker 5>answer a fucking pole.</v>

3297
02:28:10.250 --> 02:28:12.800
<v Speaker 5>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 5>pitches.</v>

3298
02:28:13.570 --> 02:28:16.160
<v Speaker 5>I had a little bit in my act.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's based on true pole.</v>

3299
02:28:16.490 --> 02:28:17.323
<v Speaker 5>We're 46 percent of the people believed </v>
<v Speaker 5>in the creationist account of the earth </v>

3300
02:28:21.400 --> 02:28:22.040
<v Speaker 5>that the earth was</v>

3301
02:28:22.040 --> 02:28:23.330
<v Speaker 1>less than 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years old.</v>

3302
02:28:23.720 --> 02:28:25.280
<v Speaker 1>Forty six,</v>
<v Speaker 1>46 percent,</v>

3303
02:28:25.310 --> 02:28:27.350
<v Speaker 1>46 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but was a Gallup poll.</v>

3304
02:28:27.351 --> 02:28:29.120
<v Speaker 1>So it's 46 percent of the people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>answer the poll.</v>

3305
02:28:29.121 --> 02:28:32.540
<v Speaker 1>That was a little bit in my right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so like how ridiculous.</v>

3306
02:28:32.640 --> 02:28:34.880
<v Speaker 1>That's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not getting a good test group.</v>

3307
02:28:35.080 --> 02:28:38.450
<v Speaker 1>So actually answering the question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are answering the phone,</v>

3308
02:28:39.970 --> 02:28:42.020
<v Speaker 1>talking to you about some different </v>
<v Speaker 1>aspects.</v>

3309
02:28:42.040 --> 02:28:44.040
<v Speaker 1>Percent said they have tried it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hm.</v>

3310
02:28:44.180 --> 02:28:45.650
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's 43 percent.</v>

3311
02:28:45.651 --> 02:28:46.484
<v Speaker 1>If it was legal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'd be smoking pot and they currently </v>

3312
02:28:48.501 --> 02:28:51.350

<v Speaker 1>but it's enough to put a lot of tax </v>
<v Speaker 1>dollars into the economy.</v>

3316
02:29:02.350 --> 02:29:04.220
<v Speaker 1>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a tremendous amount of money.</v>

<v Speaker 1>If it's really 40,</v>

3318
02:29:06.080 --> 02:29:07.310
<v Speaker 1>whatever the hell it is.</v>

02:29:07.370 --> 02:29:08.203
<v Speaker 1>Tried it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was the present of the trial at </v>

3320
02:29:09.021 --> 02:29:09.854
<v Speaker 1>1:43.</v>

3321
02:29:09.890 --> 02:29:11.200
<v Speaker 1>Forty three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

3322
02:29:11.240 --> 02:29:13.880
<v Speaker 1>that's the number.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just crazy,</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's pretty good.</v>

3324
02:29:15.370 --> 02:29:19.300
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy to another question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shut the fuck up dude.</v>

3325
02:29:20.200 --> 02:29:25.200
<v Speaker 1>You ruin it was in those people against </v>
<v Speaker 1>you voting wise,</v>

3326
02:29:27.500 --> 02:29:30.590
<v Speaker 1>that's a pretty significant people like </v>
<v Speaker 1>the stoner dollar has been ignored.</v>

3327
02:29:30.591 --> 02:29:31.424
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you say who will make those </v>

3328
02:29:32.991 --> 02:29:33.824
<v Speaker 1>decisions as a businessman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the other people that are fighting </v>

3329
02:29:36.711 --> 02:29:40.040
<v Speaker 1>against that or all the pharmaceutical </v>
<v Speaker 1>companies and they have a lot more money</v>

3330
02:29:40.041 --> 02:29:40.874
<v Speaker 1>than these kids smoking pot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that businessman walks into his </v>

3331
02:29:44.181 --> 02:29:45.890
<v Speaker 1>office and says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

3332
02:29:46.520 --> 02:29:49.040
<v Speaker 1>this is the way it's really going to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what we really need.</v>

3333
02:29:49.041 --> 02:29:53.000
<v Speaker 1>That is permanent though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it possible that the people acting</v>

3334
02:29:53.001 --> 02:29:56.780
<v Speaker 1>collectively have more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more influence collectively,</v>

3335
02:29:56.810 --> 02:30:00.050
<v Speaker 1>financially than a corporation?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's been exposed.</v>

3336
02:30:00.980 --> 02:30:03.840
<v Speaker 1>Never.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not going to get any better because</v>

3337
02:30:03.841 --> 02:30:08.720
<v Speaker 1>of the Internet transparency there right</v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

3338
02:30:08.780 --> 02:30:11.950
<v Speaker 1>The corporations have a lot more power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3339
02:30:12.050 --> 02:30:13.220
<v Speaker 1>Right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>

3340
02:30:13.221 --> 02:30:14.420
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you watch,</v>

<v Speaker 1>They want to stop her from selling those</v>

3344

02:34:23.981 --> 02:34:26.770
<v Speaker 5>Go back to the last one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was just like a rat.</v>

3426
02:34:27.810 --> 02:34:31.420
<v Speaker 5>They saying these rat lake [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 5>Click on that one.</v>

3427
02:34:31.421 --> 02:34:32.890
<v Speaker 5>We were just reading.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3428
02:34:32.960 --> 02:34:35.230
<v Speaker 5>The whatever the one was to you right </v>
<v Speaker 5>before that one.</v>

3429
02:34:38.050 --> 02:34:39.030
<v Speaker 5>Well that's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's,</v>

3430
02:34:39.040 --> 02:34:41.110
<v Speaker 5>let's just look at it right there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but scroll down.</v>

3431
02:34:41.111 --> 02:34:43.930
<v Speaker 5>That little definition on top is a </v>
<v Speaker 5>little bit more lengthly.</v>

3432
02:34:44.170 --> 02:34:47.290
<v Speaker 5>There we go.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So a single origin asm composed of cells</v>

3433
02:34:47.291 --> 02:34:48.930
<v Speaker 5>from different zygotes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

3434
02:34:48.931 --> 02:34:49.764
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So a single cell like an Amoeba will </v>

3435
02:34:54.340 --> 02:34:54.910
<v Speaker 5>hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Stop,</v>

3436
02:34:54.910 --> 02:34:55.743
<v Speaker 5>go back.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This can result in male and female </v>

3437
02:34:59.141 --> 02:35:03.580
<v Speaker 5>organs to blood types or subtle </v>
<v Speaker 5>variations and form.</v>

3438
02:35:03.910 --> 02:35:05.560
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now go back to that story again.</v>

3439
02:35:08.080 --> 02:35:08.913
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A chimeric writer calling himself </v>

3440
02:35:11.230 --> 02:35:15.730
<v Speaker 5>shepherd Stewart sold by this one celled</v>
<v Speaker 5>organism writer.</v>

3441
02:35:15.790 --> 02:35:16.830
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that.</v>

3442
02:35:16.831 --> 02:35:17.664
<v Speaker 5>That's an insult.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I guess in the wake of the 2016 US </v>

3443
02:35:21.911 --> 02:35:24.970
<v Speaker 5>presidential election,</v>
<v Speaker 5>two major issues rose to the surface.</v>

3444
02:35:24.971 --> 02:35:25.804
<v Speaker 5>Dissemination of information,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fake news and accusations of bias </v>

3445
02:35:29.081 --> 02:35:30.700
<v Speaker 5>journalism.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

3446
02:35:30.701 --> 02:35:35.500
<v Speaker 5>So Elon Musk,</v>
<v Speaker 5>can anyone uncover who is really writing</v>

3447
02:35:35.501 --> 02:35:37.630
<v Speaker 5>these fake pieces?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's cool.</v>

3448
02:35:37.670 --> 02:35:40.450
<v Speaker 5>Call asking for the Internet to help.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3449
02:35:40.600 --> 02:35:43.000
<v Speaker 5>His can't be this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>His work is better than that.</v>

3450
02:35:43.001 --> 02:35:45.820
<v Speaker 5>And then they click on that article,</v>
<v Speaker 5>click on that article and finance.</v>

3451
02:35:46.120 --> 02:35:47.140
<v Speaker 5>See if they took it down.</v>

3452
02:35:49.070 --> 02:35:51.830
<v Speaker 5>That's pretty great.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Elan musk versus the trolls.</v>

3453
02:35:51.890 --> 02:35:52.670
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>

3454
02:35:52.670 --> 02:35:53.503
<v Speaker 5>They switched it to this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's just essentially Elon musk </v>

3455
02:35:57.020 --> 02:35:58.970
<v Speaker 5>calling out this guy for the fake </v>
<v Speaker 5>article.</v>

3456
02:35:58.971 --> 02:36:00.350
<v Speaker 5>I don't think the fake articles up </v>
<v Speaker 5>anymore.</v>

3457
02:36:00.351 --> 02:36:01.184
<v Speaker 5>I think the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3458
02:36:01.220 --> 02:36:02.053
<v Speaker 5>he's the coolest,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I think that's just what you can do </v>

3459
02:36:05.061 --> 02:36:05.894
<v Speaker 5>now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If this guy who was we were reading </v>

3460
02:36:06.681 --> 02:36:08.700
<v Speaker 5>about earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this guy can get 10,000</v>

3461
02:36:08.740 --> 02:36:10.180
<v Speaker 5>bucks a month.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3462
02:36:10.670 --> 02:36:12.770
<v Speaker 5>By just making stuff up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just make up stories.</v>

3463
02:36:12.771 --> 02:36:13.604
<v Speaker 5>They so many made up an article about me</v>
<v Speaker 5>getting into a fight with a mountain </v>

3464
02:36:15.561 --> 02:36:18.440
<v Speaker 5>lion that killed them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>outline at the Ice House.</v>

3465
02:36:18.500 --> 02:36:21.430
<v Speaker 5>Really ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My sister called me up and asked me what</v>

3466
02:36:21.440 --> 02:36:22.910
<v Speaker 5>is true.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God.</v>

3467
02:36:23.150 --> 02:36:25.730
<v Speaker 5>But they just do that all day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So if they do that all the day,</v>

3468
02:36:25.731 --> 02:36:28.140
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a Jodie foster visited by real aliens.</v>

3469
02:36:28.190 --> 02:36:29.410
<v Speaker 5>If they do that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3470
02:36:29.411 --> 02:36:30.244
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then you'll have her sitting there </v>

3471
02:36:31.071 --> 02:36:31.760
<v Speaker 5>talking about it.</v>

3472
02:36:31.760 --> 02:36:35.570
<v Speaker 5>Like if you're a dumb ass,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you gonna send that to your friend.</v>

3473
02:36:36.050 --> 02:36:37.940
<v Speaker 5>Jodie foster was fucking coming out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

3474
02:36:38.090 --> 02:36:41.000
<v Speaker 5>Finally,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the agendas being new and the aliens are</v>

3475
02:36:41.001 --> 02:36:41.840
<v Speaker 5>real.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're here,</v>

3476
02:36:41.860 --> 02:36:42.980
<v Speaker 5>Bro.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3477
02:36:43.490 --> 02:36:46.490
<v Speaker 5>and just keep putting them at one of </v>
<v Speaker 5>them's gonna stick right in my head,</v>

3478
02:36:46.540 --> 02:36:47.700
<v Speaker 5>Bro.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Definition.</v>

3479
02:36:47.810 --> 02:36:49.070
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>another definition.</v>

3480
02:36:49.100 --> 02:36:51.170
<v Speaker 5>Unreal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Imaginary visionary,</v>

3481
02:36:51.171 --> 02:36:53.660
<v Speaker 5>a trauma lyrical,</v>
<v Speaker 5>terrestrial paradise.</v>

3482
02:36:54.560 --> 02:36:58.910
<v Speaker 5>Wildly fanciful,</v>
<v Speaker 5>highly unrealistic plan.</v>

3483
02:36:59.660 --> 02:37:01.310
<v Speaker 5>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Unreal.</v>

3484
02:37:01.311 --> 02:37:06.311
<v Speaker 5>Imaginary or visionary.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it was an imaginary writer as well.</v>

3485
02:37:07.030 --> 02:37:09.050
<v Speaker 5>It sounds like a real writer with an </v>
<v Speaker 5>imaginary name.</v>

3486
02:37:09.080 --> 02:37:13.740
<v Speaker 5>So it's just a pseudonym.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Essentially a pseudonym with the fucking</v>

3487
02:37:13.760 --> 02:37:15.440
<v Speaker 5>person is a pseudonym.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bomp.</v>

3488
02:37:15.560 --> 02:37:16.393
<v Speaker 5>Bomp.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bomp.</v>

3489
02:37:16.550 --> 02:37:17.383
<v Speaker 5>I wonder if like businesses hire people </v>
<v Speaker 5>to do things like that to discredit </v>

3490
02:37:20.571 --> 02:37:22.790
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3491
02:37:23.320 --> 02:37:24.153
<v Speaker 5>if you're Ford and the Chevy guys who </v>
<v Speaker 5>are just getting a little too fucking </v>

3492
02:37:26.751 --> 02:37:30.080
<v Speaker 5>cocky and there was some dude like Henry</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ford type character over it.</v>

3493
02:37:30.080 --> 02:37:32.750
<v Speaker 5>Chevy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some magnanimous,</v>

3494
02:37:32.780 --> 02:37:33.613
<v Speaker 5>gigantic larger than life figure and </v>
<v Speaker 5>start writing some fake shit about him </v>

3495
02:37:36.820 --> 02:37:37.653
<v Speaker 5>pawning money off the government and </v>
<v Speaker 5>eating pizza at this place where they </v>

3496
02:37:39.711 --> 02:37:40.544
<v Speaker 5>have pedophilia artwork.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In the old days they called it yellow </v>

3497
02:37:42.441 --> 02:37:45.470
<v Speaker 5>journalism,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the hearst newspapers.</v>

3498
02:37:45.471 --> 02:37:46.304
<v Speaker 5>They'd plants fake stories in the papers</v>
<v Speaker 5>and people would think that they were </v>

3499
02:37:50.031 --> 02:37:50.864
<v Speaker 5>true and you'd try and take down titans </v>
<v Speaker 5>of business that you were competing </v>

3500
02:37:53.331 --> 02:37:56.240
<v Speaker 5>against and all the rest of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's always existed.</v>

3501
02:37:56.660 --> 02:37:57.021
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3502
02:37:57.021 --> 02:38:00.110
<v Speaker 5>that's what William Randolph hearst did </v>
<v Speaker 5>against marijuana.</v>

3503
02:38:00.510 --> 02:38:02.750
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's how marijuana became illegal.</v>

3504
02:38:02.810 --> 02:38:03.980
<v Speaker 5>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>

3505
02:38:04.070 --> 02:38:04.903
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I did not know the full stoner Bible </v>

3506
02:38:06.801 --> 02:38:07.820
<v Speaker 5>story.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>

3507
02:38:07.880 --> 02:38:10.100
<v Speaker 5>the biblical creation story of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>Stoner myth.</v>

3508
02:38:10.220 --> 02:38:11.060
<v Speaker 5>Real.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3509
02:38:11.061 --> 02:38:11.894
<v Speaker 5>This is what it is here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That would been 19 thirties post right </v>

3510
02:38:15.381 --> 02:38:17.330
<v Speaker 5>after prohibition.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Alcohol prohibition.</v>

3511
02:38:17.780 --> 02:38:18.613
<v Speaker 5>The.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What happened was they came out with a </v>

3512
02:38:20.091 --> 02:38:24.290
<v Speaker 5>machine called the decorticator and the </v>
<v Speaker 5>decorticator allows them to process hemp</v>

3513
02:38:24.291 --> 02:38:26.300
<v Speaker 5>fiber more easily with this machine.</v>

3514
02:38:26.300 --> 02:38:29.540
<v Speaker 5>It cranks it through because hemp is </v>
<v Speaker 5>this spectacular fiber.</v>

3515
02:38:29.870 --> 02:38:32.150
<v Speaker 5>Like a buddy of mine had a hemp stalk </v>
<v Speaker 5>over his house.</v>

3516
02:38:32.151 --> 02:38:33.560
<v Speaker 5>My friend Todd Mccormick,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and he's like,</v>

3517
02:38:33.561 --> 02:38:35.210
<v Speaker 5>pick it up man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I picked it.</v>

3518
02:38:35.211 --> 02:38:36.080
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whoa.</v>

3519
02:38:36.110 --> 02:38:37.870
<v Speaker 5>It's light like Balsa wood,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

3520
02:38:37.880 --> 02:38:39.710
<v Speaker 5>but hard,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a Mahogany.</v>

3521
02:38:40.030 --> 02:38:41.220
<v Speaker 5>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3522
02:38:41.330 --> 02:38:43.320
<v Speaker 5>It's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very strange bamboo.</v>

3523
02:38:43.760 --> 02:38:44.980
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

3524
02:38:44.990 --> 02:38:45.291
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

3525
02:38:45.291 --> 02:38:47.660
<v Speaker 5>because bamboo is hollow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It makes sense that it's light.</v>

3526
02:38:47.990 --> 02:38:49.940
<v Speaker 5>This is like a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was like a stock,</v>

3527
02:38:49.941 --> 02:38:51.930
<v Speaker 5>like a risk side.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like my wrist.</v>

3528
02:38:52.760 --> 02:38:53.950
<v Speaker 5>That's bamboo,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3529
02:38:53.951 --> 02:38:56.170
<v Speaker 5>That's the hemp plant.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3530
02:38:56.590 --> 02:38:57.423
<v Speaker 5>You can get it and there's different </v>
<v Speaker 5>forms of it and see that one in the </v>

3531
02:39:00.501 --> 02:39:02.190
<v Speaker 5>upper right hand corner like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So this.</v>

3532
02:39:03.110 --> 02:39:05.180
<v Speaker 5>Gotcha.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He had it like that.</v>

3533
02:39:05.280 --> 02:39:06.710
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you would pick it up.</v>

3534
02:39:06.740 --> 02:39:09.530
<v Speaker 5>It'd be super light,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but ridiculously hard.</v>

3535
02:39:09.710 --> 02:39:10.341
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>

3536
02:39:10.341 --> 02:39:12.200
<v Speaker 5>it's alien.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's an alien planet.</v>

3537
02:39:12.660 --> 02:39:14.330
<v Speaker 5>It's todd's very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very smart.</v>

3538
02:39:14.600 --> 02:39:15.433
<v Speaker 5>He's written books on growing marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was like one of the first guys to </v>

3539
02:39:17.241 --> 02:39:19.340
<v Speaker 5>ever get arrested for,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3540
02:39:19.610 --> 02:39:22.220
<v Speaker 5>growing medical marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then when he went to court,</v>

3541
02:39:22.221 --> 02:39:25.730
<v Speaker 5>he found out he was not even allowed to </v>
<v Speaker 5>use the term medical.</v>

3542
02:39:26.350 --> 02:39:29.150
<v Speaker 5>So you're not allowed to say it because </v>
<v Speaker 5>they don't believe in it federally.</v>

3543
02:39:29.151 --> 02:39:29.984
<v Speaker 5>So even though it's legal in California,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what they did was they prosecuted him </v>

3544
02:39:33.681 --> 02:39:36.650
<v Speaker 5>with federal laws which don't allow for </v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

3545
02:39:36.651 --> 02:39:37.484
<v Speaker 5>even the phrase medical marijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he wasn't even allowed because it was a </v>

3546
02:39:40.131 --> 02:39:40.964
<v Speaker 5>federal trial.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He wasn't even allowed to mention that </v>

3547
02:39:43.101 --> 02:39:46.610
<v Speaker 5>it was legal in California.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So the people who were in the jury,</v>

3548
02:39:46.720 --> 02:39:51.720
<v Speaker 5>they get this totally skewed perspective</v>
<v Speaker 5>of what happened and you have to vote on</v>

3549
02:39:53.991 --> 02:39:54.441
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3550
02:39:54.441 --> 02:39:57.170
<v Speaker 5>as a juror,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have to decide based on the law.</v>

3551
02:39:57.620 --> 02:39:59.570
<v Speaker 5>And the law is federally,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it is illegal.</v>

3552
02:39:59.570 --> 02:40:01.070
<v Speaker 5>There's no such thing as medical </v>
<v Speaker 5>marijuana.</v>

3553
02:40:01.071 --> 02:40:01.904
<v Speaker 5>So you can't even bring it up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And if you brought in contempt of court </v>

3554
02:40:04.970 --> 02:40:06.960
<v Speaker 5>and her started all this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he started.</v>

3555
02:40:07.310 --> 02:40:10.280
<v Speaker 5>And what happened was when they came out</v>
<v Speaker 5>with the decorticator,</v>

3556
02:40:10.640 --> 02:40:12.830
<v Speaker 5>William Randolph hearst owned paper </v>
<v Speaker 5>mills,</v>

3557
02:40:12.960 --> 02:40:16.950
<v Speaker 5>and he also owned these forests of trees</v>
<v Speaker 5>that they would convert into paper.</v>

3558
02:40:16.951 --> 02:40:19.470
<v Speaker 5>He made his own newspaper and print it </v>
<v Speaker 5>on that paper,</v>

3559
02:40:20.010 --> 02:40:24.090
<v Speaker 5>and then Popular Science magazine had a </v>
<v Speaker 5>cover that said hemp,</v>

3560
02:40:24.360 --> 02:40:25.193
<v Speaker 5>the new billion dollar crop,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it was all about the invention of </v>

3561
02:40:28.831 --> 02:40:29.664
<v Speaker 5>the decorticator and how now they'd be </v>
<v Speaker 5>able to effectively process this hemp </v>

3562
02:40:32.910 --> 02:40:36.840
<v Speaker 5>because they used hemp forever because </v>
<v Speaker 5>he didn't have a cotton gin.</v>

3563
02:40:37.110 --> 02:40:37.943
<v Speaker 5>They only came out with the cotton gin.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A lot of people shifted over to cotton </v>

3564
02:40:40.201 --> 02:40:42.660
<v Speaker 5>because,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially at the end of slavery,</v>

3565
02:40:42.810 --> 02:40:43.643
<v Speaker 5>because it wasn't really financially </v>
<v Speaker 5>sound until they spend all that time </v>

3566
02:40:47.851 --> 02:40:48.684
<v Speaker 5>processing all that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that fiber to get cannabis or to get a </v>

3567
02:40:52.920 --> 02:40:55.460
<v Speaker 5>canvas where when you could just get it </v>
<v Speaker 5>out of cotton,</v>

3568
02:40:55.470 --> 02:40:58.260
<v Speaker 5>it'd be like way easier now with this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a cotton gin,</v>

3569
02:40:58.380 --> 02:40:59.070
<v Speaker 5>the cotton gin.</v>

3570
02:40:59.070 --> 02:40:59.903
<v Speaker 5>So that changed the game.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then the decorticator changed the </v>

3571
02:41:02.011 --> 02:41:02.844
<v Speaker 5>game again.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's when William Randolph hearst </v>

3572
02:41:05.071 --> 02:41:05.904
<v Speaker 5>came in and they started writing all </v>
<v Speaker 5>these stories about telling people to </v>

3573
02:41:08.911 --> 02:41:11.010
<v Speaker 5>write stories.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure telling people to write stories</v>

3574
02:41:11.011 --> 02:41:15.600
<v Speaker 5>about this new drug called marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's forcing blacks and Mexicans to have</v>

3575
02:41:15.601 --> 02:41:16.434
<v Speaker 5>sex with white women and rape white </v>
<v Speaker 5>women and marijuana wasn't even a name </v>

3576
02:41:20.010 --> 02:41:21.860
<v Speaker 5>for,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for the camp,</v>

3577
02:41:22.050 --> 02:41:26.400
<v Speaker 5>for cannabis.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The word was a wild Mexican tobacco.</v>

3578
02:41:26.430 --> 02:41:28.920
<v Speaker 5>That was where.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what marijuana originally was.</v>

3579
02:41:29.340 --> 02:41:30.990
<v Speaker 5>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So then when you called it marijuana,</v>

3580
02:41:30.991 --> 02:41:33.570
<v Speaker 5>they weren't like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you're talking to Mexicans about it,</v>

3581
02:41:33.571 --> 02:41:34.404
<v Speaker 5>they'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what the f like back then they'd be </v>

3582
02:41:35.251 --> 02:41:36.350
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck you talking about?</v>

3583
02:41:36.460 --> 02:41:39.150
<v Speaker 5>That's that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That wild tobacco type shit.</v>

3584
02:41:39.210 --> 02:41:40.043
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they called it marijuana because </v>

3585
02:41:41.220 --> 02:41:43.230
<v Speaker 5>cannabis was something that everybody </v>
<v Speaker 5>had used.</v>

3586
02:41:43.440 --> 02:41:44.880
<v Speaker 5>They used it for a textile.</v>

3587
02:41:44.880 --> 02:41:48.150
<v Speaker 5>They used it for oil.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was so many people that were using</v>

3588
02:41:48.151 --> 02:41:52.410
<v Speaker 5>it already for close canvases.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Canvas is based on the word cannabis.</v>

3589
02:41:52.710 --> 02:41:54.420
<v Speaker 5>She's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They use different cloth.</v>

3590
02:41:54.421 --> 02:41:55.254
<v Speaker 5>It's a.</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a crazy cloth man and it works </v>

3591
02:41:56.731 --> 02:41:59.100
<v Speaker 5>really hard to break.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like if you get a hold of.</v>

3592
02:41:59.250 --> 02:42:01.910
<v Speaker 5>I have a gooey.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was a Datsun Sora.</v>

3593
02:42:01.980 --> 02:42:04.770
<v Speaker 5>Made me a Jujitsu gooey made out of </v>
<v Speaker 5>hemp.</v>

3594
02:42:04.771 --> 02:42:08.670
<v Speaker 5>They sell these hemp keys for fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>things are like indestructible.</v>

3595
02:42:09.150 --> 02:42:09.983
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's something about like when you </v>

3596
02:42:11.671 --> 02:42:12.504
<v Speaker 5>take hemp and you turn it into a fiber </v>
<v Speaker 5>or into a rather a cloth or into a </v>

3597
02:42:15.901 --> 02:42:18.300
<v Speaker 5>paper,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's crazy how durable it is,</v>

3598
02:42:18.301 --> 02:42:19.134
<v Speaker 5>so why didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So then he got laws passed to </v>

3599
02:42:21.300 --> 02:42:22.650
<v Speaker 5>criminalize it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>

3600
02:42:22.680 --> 02:42:23.341
<v Speaker 5>And do all that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But yeah,</v>

3601
02:42:23.341 --> 02:42:24.174
<v Speaker 5>you had to have like a tax stamp to grow</v>
<v Speaker 5>it for him and it cut became more and </v>

3602
02:42:27.090 --> 02:42:28.710
<v Speaker 5>increasingly more and more difficult.</v>

3603
02:42:28.740 --> 02:42:29.520
<v Speaker 5>Why w?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why?</v>

3604
02:42:29.520 --> 02:42:32.280
<v Speaker 5>So they were never able to separate it </v>
<v Speaker 5>as a drug and a thing.</v>

3605
02:42:32.310 --> 02:42:33.690
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because it's too close.</v>

3606
02:42:33.720 --> 02:42:35.580
<v Speaker 5>It's too closely related.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Genetically,</v>

3607
02:42:35.610 --> 02:42:38.460
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's basically you could,</v>

3608
02:42:39.270 --> 02:42:40.860
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's different strains of it.</v>

3609
02:42:40.890 --> 02:42:43.410
<v Speaker 5>They grow it where it's specifically not</v>
<v Speaker 5>psychoactive,</v>

3610
02:42:43.770 --> 02:42:47.040
<v Speaker 5>but all the male plants are not </v>
<v Speaker 5>psychoactive.</v>

3611
02:42:47.380 --> 02:42:48.213
<v Speaker 5>So only the female plants that have the </v>
<v Speaker 5>flowers and you can contaminate female </v>

3612
02:42:52.111 --> 02:42:54.900
<v Speaker 5>plants and the.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's some sort of a process that they</v>

3613
02:42:54.901 --> 02:42:55.734
<v Speaker 5>have to do when they're growing them to </v>
<v Speaker 5>keep them from changing each other and </v>

3614
02:42:59.121 --> 02:43:00.000
<v Speaker 5>hate each other.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3615
02:43:00.030 --> 02:43:02.610
<v Speaker 5>they can.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You have too many males with females.</v>

3616
02:43:02.611 --> 02:43:06.060
<v Speaker 5>They can actually fuck up the females.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's really kind of crazy,</v>

3617
02:43:06.930 --> 02:43:11.500
<v Speaker 5>but that's the only stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so I guess the issue would be would have</v>

3618
02:43:11.501 --> 02:43:12.334
<v Speaker 5>somebody that was pretending they </v>
<v Speaker 5>weren't growing the psychoactive stuff </v>

3619
02:43:15.520 --> 02:43:16.353
<v Speaker 5>and that they were only growing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they were also selling it as a drug </v>

3620
02:43:18.400 --> 02:43:19.670
<v Speaker 5>and then you would have an issue are </v>
<v Speaker 5>legal.</v>

3621
02:43:20.600 --> 02:43:21.433
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3622
02:43:21.890 --> 02:43:22.723
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you find out like hearst putting </v>

3623
02:43:24.441 --> 02:43:25.850
<v Speaker 3>out those stories,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3624
02:43:25.851 --> 02:43:26.684
<v Speaker 3>to get his way and then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>big tobacco is putting all these </v>

3625
02:43:28.911 --> 02:43:32.870
<v Speaker 3>documentaries come out like 30 years </v>
<v Speaker 3>later of all these stories,</v>

3626
02:43:32.871 --> 02:43:34.080
<v Speaker 3>this guy was hired,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rose,</v>

3627
02:43:34.100 --> 02:43:35.590
<v Speaker 3>that one where the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>

3628
02:43:35.770 --> 02:43:38.420
<v Speaker 3>this small group of scientists were </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

3629
02:43:38.900 --> 02:43:40.760
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there it was from the tobacco.</v>

3630
02:43:40.761 --> 02:43:41.594
<v Speaker 3>They were putting out stories about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>tobacco is good for you and all this </v>

3631
02:43:44.451 --> 02:43:45.830
<v Speaker 3>kind of stuff and they going to take </v>
<v Speaker 3>away for you.</v>

3632
02:43:45.980 --> 02:43:50.980
<v Speaker 3>And then they all dried up and now </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're on climate change now.</v>

3633
02:43:51.170 --> 02:43:53.720
<v Speaker 3>Now those same guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those same organizations are putting out</v>

3634
02:43:54.140 --> 02:43:57.110
<v Speaker 3>fake news and being,</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking heads for,</v>

3635
02:43:57.140 --> 02:43:58.840
<v Speaker 3>against global warming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>

3636
02:43:58.841 --> 02:44:02.060
<v Speaker 3>it's a documentary documentary on what's</v>
<v Speaker 3>called the ministers of doubt.</v>

3637
02:44:02.090 --> 02:44:03.050
<v Speaker 3>Is that it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3638
02:44:03.051 --> 02:44:03.650
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

3639
02:44:03.650 --> 02:44:04.483
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

3640
02:44:04.490 --> 02:44:06.590
<v Speaker 3>I think it's called ministers of doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean so sure.</v>

3641
02:44:06.591 --> 02:44:07.250
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These,</v>

3642
02:44:07.250 --> 02:44:08.083
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this fakeness has been happening </v>

3643
02:44:09.620 --> 02:44:12.950
<v Speaker 3>forever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>forever and driven by money.</v>

3644
02:44:12.980 --> 02:44:14.750
<v Speaker 3>If you have a lot of people that have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of money,</v>

3645
02:44:15.060 --> 02:44:19.680
<v Speaker 5>that's why if someone becomes president </v>
<v Speaker 5>and then wins,</v>

3646
02:44:19.681 --> 02:44:20.514
<v Speaker 5>the president elect trump and then tweet</v>
<v Speaker 5>something that's not true about him </v>

3647
02:44:25.411 --> 02:44:28.440
<v Speaker 5>losing the popular vote because millions</v>
<v Speaker 5>of people voted illegally.</v>

3648
02:44:28.920 --> 02:44:33.090
<v Speaker 5>When you say stuff like that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's why people get scared and nervous</v>

3649
02:44:33.091 --> 02:44:37.080
<v Speaker 5>because there's a long history of people</v>
<v Speaker 5>who have what you're going to have.</v>

3650
02:44:37.380 --> 02:44:39.780
<v Speaker 5>Donald trump is going to have ultimate </v>
<v Speaker 5>power.</v>

3651
02:44:39.850 --> 02:44:40.683
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's going to have that position to the </v>

3652
02:44:42.091 --> 02:44:46.110
<v Speaker 5>position of ultimate power,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but with that comes just a massive,</v>

3653
02:44:46.111 --> 02:44:46.944
<v Speaker 5>massive responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So for him to continue to do stuff like </v>

3654
02:44:50.491 --> 02:44:52.920
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is like a strategic fib,</v>

3655
02:44:53.160 --> 02:44:55.290
<v Speaker 5>he got to kind of let all that go.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just like he said,</v>

3656
02:44:55.291 --> 02:44:57.240
<v Speaker 5>he was going to let all of his </v>
<v Speaker 5>businesses go is gonna,</v>

3657
02:44:57.241 --> 02:44:59.910
<v Speaker 5>let his family runs businesses.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's going to completely step away.</v>

3658
02:45:00.390 --> 02:45:01.223
<v Speaker 5>I urge him,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let all that other stuff go to like try </v>

3659
02:45:05.381 --> 02:45:10.260
<v Speaker 5>to try to rise to this crazy position in</v>
<v Speaker 5>one of 40.</v>

3660
02:45:10.261 --> 02:45:11.970
<v Speaker 5>How many people have been president now?</v>

3664
02:45:16.860 --> 02:45:19.890

<v Speaker 3>Merchants of doubt.</v>

3667
02:45:22.891 --> 02:45:23.724
<v Speaker 3>There's a great documentary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when he tweets about Alec Baldwin </v>

3668
02:45:26.341 --> 02:45:28.170
<v Speaker 3>again on Saturday night,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what does he say?</v>

3669
02:45:28.230 --> 02:45:29.390
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>son watched it.</v>

3670
02:45:29.400 --> 02:45:32.700
<v Speaker 3>Tried to watch snl again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So not funny.</v>

3671
02:45:33.150 --> 02:45:35.250
<v Speaker 3>Total fail.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Totally biased.</v>

3672
02:45:35.290 --> 02:45:36.740
<v Speaker 3>Fail.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3673
02:45:36.900 --> 02:45:39.630
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you gotta realize it's funny.</v>

3674
02:45:40.020 --> 02:45:41.160
<v Speaker 3>It's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

3675
02:45:41.190 --> 02:45:44.310
<v Speaker 3>Is he doing that because he doesn't want</v>
<v Speaker 3>people to talk about Taiwan.</v>

3676
02:45:44.840 --> 02:45:46.290
<v Speaker 3>This is the funny discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

3677
02:45:46.380 --> 02:45:49.530
<v Speaker 3>is he brilliant or is he just crazy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's really what we're dealing with.</v>

3678
02:45:49.650 --> 02:45:50.483
<v Speaker 3>Izzy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So savvy that he wants to everybody not </v>

3679
02:45:52.291 --> 02:45:53.124
<v Speaker 3>to pay attention to the Taiwan phone </v>
<v Speaker 3>call and changing decades of how we </v>

3680
02:45:55.891 --> 02:46:00.540
<v Speaker 3>treat Taiwan or is that way tweeted to </v>
<v Speaker 3>divert us or is he just.</v>

3681
02:46:00.810 --> 02:46:02.940
<v Speaker 3>Taiwan was one column.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This tweet is another thing.</v>

3682
02:46:02.970 --> 02:46:05.700
<v Speaker 3>The BS that I think it's just that </v>
<v Speaker 3>Taiwan thing,</v>

3683
02:46:05.701 --> 02:46:07.800
<v Speaker 3>he just avoided it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just not talk about it.</v>

3684
02:46:07.801 --> 02:46:09.060
<v Speaker 3>Like what is he doing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What did he do?</v>

3685
02:46:09.170 --> 02:46:09.980
<v Speaker 3>Taiwan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>

3686
02:46:09.980 --> 02:46:11.660
<v Speaker 5>he contacted Taiwan.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3687
02:46:11.660 --> 02:46:14.960
<v Speaker 3>He says they content and that's he </v>
<v Speaker 3>tweets his defenses.</v>

3688
02:46:15.050 --> 02:46:17.790
<v Speaker 3>They called me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh thanks.</v>

3689
02:46:17.840 --> 02:46:18.673
<v Speaker 3>The problem you uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the policy for 40 years is that you're </v>

3690
02:46:23.630 --> 02:46:24.463
<v Speaker 3>dealing with one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>China and Taiwan wants to be their own </v>

3691
02:46:27.651 --> 02:46:30.950
<v Speaker 3>thing and you don't treat them the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>way that you do greater China,</v>

3692
02:46:31.220 --> 02:46:33.300
<v Speaker 3>that Taiwan is part of China.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you.</v>

3693
02:46:33.740 --> 02:46:38.740
<v Speaker 3>So the way that the diplomats of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>work that you're friendly with Taiwan,</v>

3694
02:46:39.170 --> 02:46:42.110
<v Speaker 3>but you don't recognize them as like </v>
<v Speaker 3>their own government.</v>

3695
02:46:42.111 --> 02:46:43.850
<v Speaker 3>You don't invite them to the White </v>
<v Speaker 3>House.</v>

3696
02:46:43.851 --> 02:46:44.684
<v Speaker 3>You don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Our leaders have never talked to their </v>

3697
02:46:46.310 --> 02:46:50.210
<v Speaker 3>leaders.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he gets phone call and he's like,</v>

3698
02:46:50.330 --> 02:46:51.081
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's up?</v>

3699

<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're cool.</v>

3700
02:46:52.160 --> 02:46:53.390
<v Speaker 3>And then China was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>

3701
02:46:53.391 --> 02:46:53.991
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>

3702
02:46:53.991 --> 02:46:54.824
<v Speaker 3>wait.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have this whole structure of the way </v>

3703
02:46:56.061 --> 02:46:56.894
<v Speaker 3>the world works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in one phone call this is talking </v>

3704
02:46:59.130 --> 02:47:01.700
<v Speaker 3>about power one receiving one phone</v>

3705
02:47:01.730 --> 02:47:05.210
<v Speaker 5>call shook that whole part of the globe.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let me just first of all,</v>

3706
02:47:05.211 --> 02:47:07.670
<v Speaker 5>start off with China,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sounds like a dickie friend,</v>

3707
02:47:08.630 --> 02:47:11.840
<v Speaker 5>Dickie friend that wants to control you </v>
<v Speaker 5>and we'll let you talk to other people.</v>

3708
02:47:11.990 --> 02:47:12.823
<v Speaker 5>So you wanted to make friends with this </v>
<v Speaker 5>new guy and the new guy wants to make </v>

3709
02:47:14.841 --> 02:47:16.580
<v Speaker 5>friends with you and China's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nah,</v>

3710
02:47:16.581 --> 02:47:17.510
<v Speaker 5>fuck that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3711
02:47:17.511 --> 02:47:21.800
<v Speaker 5>you don't even get to talk to them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's that part is pretty valid.</v>

3712
02:47:21.801 --> 02:47:23.840
<v Speaker 5>If that's everything to me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's everything.</v>

3713
02:47:23.841 --> 02:47:25.240
<v Speaker 5>It's all there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Unless,</v>

3714
02:47:25.350 --> 02:47:27.280
<v Speaker 5>I mean that's something Taiwan's doing </v>
<v Speaker 5>what?</v>

3715
02:47:27.281 --> 02:47:29.690
<v Speaker 5>We're not supposed to talk to them like </v>
<v Speaker 5>North Korea,</v>

3716
02:47:29.900 --> 02:47:30.733
<v Speaker 5>like if all of a sudden he started to </v>
<v Speaker 5>like chat with North Korea and started </v>

3717
02:47:32.541 --> 02:47:36.420
<v Speaker 5>selling Taco bowls over there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What does it say here,</v>

3718
02:47:36.450 --> 02:47:37.283
<v Speaker 5>Jamie?</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is from the Washington Post about </v>

3719
02:47:39.171 --> 02:47:40.004
<v Speaker 5>the call.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It says the message as John Bolton </v>

3720
02:47:42.111 --> 02:47:45.020
<v Speaker 5>correctly puts it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>was that the president of United States,</v>

3721
02:47:45.290 --> 02:47:48.590
<v Speaker 5>we'll talk to whoever he who,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whomever he wants,</v>

3722
02:47:48.800 --> 02:47:53.240
<v Speaker 5>if he thinks it's in the interest of the</v>
<v Speaker 5>United States and nobody in Beijing gets</v>

3723
02:47:53.241 --> 02:47:57.160
<v Speaker 5>to dictate to dictate rather to dictate </v>
<v Speaker 5>who we talked to.</v>

3724
02:47:57.500 --> 02:47:59.840
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that seems to make sense to me.</v>

3725
02:48:00.170 --> 02:48:02.990
<v Speaker 5>What are we going to talk to people?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because if we do,</v>

3726
02:48:03.000 --> 02:48:05.870
<v Speaker 5>China gets mad.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That sounds like a shitbag relationship.</v>

3727
02:48:05.960 --> 02:48:09.840
<v Speaker 5>It's similar to Obama talking to Iran.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've had friends like that where they go</v>

3728
02:48:09.841 --> 02:48:10.674
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can't talk to that person and look </v>

3729
02:48:11.510 --> 02:48:13.040
<v Speaker 5>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you have an enemy,</v>

3730
02:48:13.100 --> 02:48:16.040
<v Speaker 5>I'm not going to like cozy up to someone</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's your enemy,</v>

3731
02:48:16.430 --> 02:48:17.263
<v Speaker 5>but if you don't like somebody doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 5>necessarily mean that I don't like them </v>

3732
02:48:20.090 --> 02:48:20.923
<v Speaker 5>just because I like you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I don't have to like everybody you </v>

3733
02:48:22.761 --> 02:48:25.130
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like that sounds fucking crazy.</v>

3734
02:48:25.131 --> 02:48:26.480
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's crazy.</v>

3735
02:48:26.510 --> 02:48:27.321
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3736
02:48:27.321 --> 02:48:31.460
<v Speaker 3>I mean Obama talking to Iran,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

3737
02:48:31.490 --> 02:48:33.830
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how is this ever going to get better and</v>

3738
02:48:33.831 --> 02:48:36.050
<v Speaker 3>less?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Our leaders talk to their leader.</v>

3739
02:48:36.080 --> 02:48:37.100
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're never gonna.</v>

02:48:37.160 --> 02:48:37.993
<v Speaker 3>You're never gonna get any.</v>

3741
02:48:38.740 --> 02:48:40.170
<v Speaker 5>If China tells you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can't talk to them.</v>

3742
02:48:40.180 --> 02:48:43.120
<v Speaker 5>Like what?</v>

<v Speaker 5>call is we don't know.</v>

<v Speaker 5>We're going to war over this.</v>

3768
02:49:33.001 --> 02:49:33.834
<v Speaker 5>I will totally go to war over this </v>
<v Speaker 5>financial war called the lawyers start </v>

3769
02:49:38.161 --> 02:49:39.180
<v Speaker 5>suing you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What?</v>

3770
02:49:39.270 --> 02:49:40.500
<v Speaker 5>Why are you suing me?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Man?</v>

3771
02:49:40.580 --> 02:49:45.580
<v Speaker 3>I don't understand the whole.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't understand the whole Asia aspect</v>

3772
02:49:46.191 --> 02:49:48.470
<v Speaker 3>of our.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of global policy at all.</v>

3773
02:49:48.530 --> 02:49:49.620
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me tell you this.</v>

3774
02:49:49.670 --> 02:49:51.140
<v Speaker 3>I don't the UFC,</v>

3775
02:49:51.240 --> 02:49:52.073
<v Speaker 5>this is my,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what I understand about some Asian </v>

3776
02:49:54.031 --> 02:49:56.250
<v Speaker 5>businesses are at least chip Japanese </v>
<v Speaker 5>businesses.</v>

3777
02:49:56.460 --> 02:50:00.330
<v Speaker 5>The UFC bought this company called pride</v>
<v Speaker 5>and a boy,</v>

3778
02:50:00.360 --> 02:50:02.790
<v Speaker 5>they get hoodwinked.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh my goodness.</v>

3779
02:50:02.820 --> 02:50:05.370
<v Speaker 5>The way they did it was wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 5>First of all,</v>

3780
02:50:05.490 --> 02:50:06.323
<v Speaker 5>the way that the Japanese have this </v>
<v Speaker 5>masterful way of negotiating business </v>

3781
02:50:10.740 --> 02:50:13.350
<v Speaker 5>where they talk to you about like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe we'll do business,</v>

3782
02:50:13.470 --> 02:50:14.303
<v Speaker 5>we're thinking about doing business,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not today and maybe we'll come back and </v>

3783
02:50:18.210 --> 02:50:20.820
<v Speaker 5>discuss this at a later date and then </v>
<v Speaker 5>they would come back.</v>

3784
02:50:20.821 --> 02:50:21.654
<v Speaker 5>What we're really thinking about selling</v>
<v Speaker 5>his business and then the UFC and pride </v>

3785
02:50:24.781 --> 02:50:28.200
<v Speaker 5>started trading fighters.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They did like a goodwill gesture.</v>

3786
02:50:28.520 --> 02:50:29.353
<v Speaker 5>So what this did was elevate the brand </v>
<v Speaker 5>of pride and make print pride even </v>

3787
02:50:33.211 --> 02:50:35.970
<v Speaker 5>bigger in the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like they had family Silva come over and</v>

3788
02:50:35.971 --> 02:50:36.804
<v Speaker 5>he faced off with chocolate and </v>
<v Speaker 5>chocolate l went over there to fight </v>

3789
02:50:39.091 --> 02:50:39.924
<v Speaker 5>people and they had all this negotiating</v>
<v Speaker 5>stuff going on for a long time and then </v>

3790
02:50:43.741 --> 02:50:45.780
<v Speaker 5>finally the UFC comes in and buys them </v>
<v Speaker 5>out.</v>

3791
02:50:45.990 --> 02:50:48.570
<v Speaker 5>This big historic thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>take photos,</v>

3792
02:50:48.630 --> 02:50:51.510
<v Speaker 5>shaking hands.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Turns out they bought nothing.</v>

3793
02:50:51.870 --> 02:50:56.870
<v Speaker 5>What they bought was essentially like a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a library of fights.</v>

3794
02:50:57.810 --> 02:51:00.690
<v Speaker 5>All the contracts that the fighters had,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're all bad.</v>

3795
02:51:00.720 --> 02:51:04.410
<v Speaker 5>They're all illegal and invalid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They had like a couple of contracts,</v>

3796
02:51:04.590 --> 02:51:06.480
<v Speaker 5>some guys that they had to take over and</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

3797
02:51:06.481 --> 02:51:08.340
<v Speaker 5>oh Jesus Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like it was just chaos.</v>

3798
02:51:08.341 --> 02:51:09.174
<v Speaker 5>But as far as they were going to like </v>
<v Speaker 5>run that business over there where they </v>

3799
02:51:11.731 --> 02:51:13.170
<v Speaker 5>got over there and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh my God,</v>

3800
02:51:13.171 --> 02:51:15.900
<v Speaker 5>we can't run this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like you can't run it without the Yakuza</v>

3801
02:51:16.290 --> 02:51:17.123
<v Speaker 5>people that were all like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have to have the consent of the </v>

3802
02:51:18.931 --> 02:51:21.480
<v Speaker 5>Japanese mom to run the country company </v>
<v Speaker 5>over there.</v>

3803
02:51:21.780 --> 02:51:24.120
<v Speaker 5>And like that was like one of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>Chinese know Japanese,</v>

3804
02:51:24.121 --> 02:51:24.900
<v Speaker 5>Japanese,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Japanese.</v>

3805
02:51:24.900 --> 02:51:25.733
<v Speaker 5>That was one of the things that sunk the</v>
<v Speaker 5>organization when it was publicly </v>

3806
02:51:27.691 --> 02:51:28.524
<v Speaker 5>released,</v>
<v Speaker 5>allegedly allegedly that the Yakuza was </v>

3807
02:51:31.201 --> 02:51:32.460
<v Speaker 5>involved.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everybody was like,</v>

3808
02:51:32.461 --> 02:51:34.770
<v Speaker 5>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they went over there,</v>

3809
02:51:34.771 --> 02:51:36.660
<v Speaker 5>they bought this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they got this library,</v>

3810
02:51:36.661 --> 02:51:38.910
<v Speaker 5>and then while they had these UFC </v>
<v Speaker 5>employees,</v>

3811
02:51:39.180 --> 02:51:40.013
<v Speaker 5>the employees all started a new business</v>
<v Speaker 5>called dream and they just fucking </v>

3812
02:51:43.510 --> 02:51:45.510
<v Speaker 5>started up with a whole new thing of </v>
<v Speaker 5>nowhere.</v>

3813
02:51:45.780 --> 02:51:46.613
<v Speaker 5>So they weren't like.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They bought pride and pride is dead in </v>

3814
02:51:49.100 --> 02:51:50.520
<v Speaker 5>the same Japanese people like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

3815
02:51:50.521 --> 02:51:51.720
<v Speaker 5>we have dream,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and they're like,</v>

3816
02:51:51.721 --> 02:51:53.970
<v Speaker 5>but hey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you guys were working for us.</v>

3817
02:51:54.490 --> 02:51:57.090
<v Speaker 5>Our show.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What the fuck is this?</v>

3818
02:51:57.710 --> 02:52:00.060
<v Speaker 5>It's like they bought,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they bought like air.</v>

3819
02:52:00.130 --> 02:52:00.963
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe we are all unknowable to each </v>

3820
02:52:02.741 --> 02:52:06.160
<v Speaker 3>other and this is why this is part of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Brexit went down,</v>

3821
02:52:06.160 --> 02:52:06.993
<v Speaker 4>is part of why trump won.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is why Italy just hit their prime </v>

3822
02:52:09.581 --> 02:52:12.700
<v Speaker 4>ministers now leaving populist vote.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everybody wants.</v>

3823
02:52:12.740 --> 02:52:16.690
<v Speaker 4>Everyone's like being told we've got to </v>
<v Speaker 4>deal with the whole world.</v>

3824
02:52:16.691 --> 02:52:17.524
<v Speaker 4>Globalization.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We had to deal with everybody and </v>

3825
02:52:18.740 --> 02:52:20.720
<v Speaker 4>everyone's starting to say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3826
02:52:20.740 --> 02:52:24.190
<v Speaker 4>it's not really helping us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do we have to talk to the Chinese?</v>

3827
02:52:24.191 --> 02:52:28.840
<v Speaker 4>Do we have to deal with everybody or do </v>
<v Speaker 4>we have to all be one Europe?</v>

3828
02:52:29.250 --> 02:52:31.150
<v Speaker 4>Everybody is starting to kind of </v>
<v Speaker 4>retreat.</v>

3829
02:52:31.151 --> 02:52:34.470
<v Speaker 4>Maybe globalization is an idea on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>paper.</v>

3830
02:52:34.480 --> 02:52:39.100
<v Speaker 4>Seems like it'll work,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but practically it's not taking hold.</v>

3831
02:52:39.190 --> 02:52:41.080
<v Speaker 4>We're all going to communicate through </v>
<v Speaker 4>Tesla,</v>

3832
02:52:41.081 --> 02:52:41.914
<v Speaker 4>hive mind because in the future </v>
<v Speaker 4>everyone's going to have to have an </v>

3833
02:52:43.841 --> 02:52:44.674
<v Speaker 4>electric car and Tesla is going to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>the first to figure out that the best </v>

3834
02:52:47.051 --> 02:52:49.720
<v Speaker 4>way to pilot your car is actually with a</v>
<v Speaker 4>headset,</v>

3835
02:52:49.840 --> 02:52:51.070
<v Speaker 4>so you're going to put on a headset.</v>

3836
02:52:51.070 --> 02:52:54.850
<v Speaker 4>Very light knows electrodes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're all be bluetooth to your car and</v>

3837
02:52:54.851 --> 02:52:55.684
<v Speaker 4>that thing will operate by your mind,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the best way it would probably be </v>

3838
02:52:58.991 --> 02:53:03.790
<v Speaker 4>wise to do that is you've got to be on </v>
<v Speaker 4>Google hive minds network,</v>

3839
02:53:04.140 --> 02:53:04.973
<v Speaker 4>so then you download the thoughts or you</v>
<v Speaker 4>project the thoughts through the head </v>

3840
02:53:08.131 --> 02:53:12.220
<v Speaker 4>gear as pure intention so everybody </v>
<v Speaker 4>knows where everybody's going as they're</v>

3841
02:53:12.221 --> 02:53:13.054
<v Speaker 4>driving because you can see pure </v>
<v Speaker 4>intention from a mile away and that </v>

3842
02:53:15.881 --> 02:53:18.010
<v Speaker 4>becomes a universal language of human </v>
<v Speaker 4>beings.</v>

3843
02:53:18.220 --> 02:53:19.053
<v Speaker 4>When they realize the flaws of English </v>
<v Speaker 4>and Spanish and Chinese and Dutch or </v>

3844
02:53:21.760 --> 02:53:22.593
<v Speaker 4>Japanese and Korean and no one can </v>
<v Speaker 4>understand what the fuck they were </v>

3845
02:53:23.981 --> 02:53:27.610
<v Speaker 4>talking about through through Google </v>
<v Speaker 4>hive mind.</v>

3846
02:53:27.670 --> 02:53:30.130
<v Speaker 4>This is connected to the Tesla as it </v>
<v Speaker 4>drives around.</v>

3847
02:53:30.220 --> 02:53:32.590
<v Speaker 4>Is this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is this an in the next update?</v>

3848
02:53:32.620 --> 02:53:35.820
<v Speaker 4>Whereas this in one more hit of that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>take another hit of that.</v>

3849
02:53:36.210 --> 02:53:39.250
<v Speaker 4>You'll have some good ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One more hit of the.</v>

3850
02:53:39.251 --> 02:53:41.650
<v Speaker 4>I don't even know what the name.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't even ask names or pot anymore.</v>

3851
02:53:41.651 --> 02:53:43.480
<v Speaker 4>It's all ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3852
02:53:43.481 --> 02:53:44.314
<v Speaker 4>I was pretty blown away.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really felt like an old man in a pot </v>

3853
02:53:46.721 --> 02:53:48.490
<v Speaker 4>shop.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like so wait.</v>

3854
02:53:48.660 --> 02:53:49.700
<v Speaker 4>She was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is.</v>

3855
02:53:49.780 --> 02:53:52.820
<v Speaker 4>This is a King Kong or something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I was in.</v>

3856
02:53:52.960 --> 02:53:54.100
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

3857
02:53:54.101 --> 02:53:56.710
<v Speaker 4>everybody knows this name.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't realize.</v>

3858
02:53:56.711 --> 02:53:58.720
<v Speaker 4>I thought this was your own little </v>
<v Speaker 4>brand.</v>

3859
02:53:58.750 --> 02:53:59.583
<v Speaker 4>I was so lost.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They wouldn't let my mom in a pot shop </v>

3860
02:54:02.350 --> 02:54:05.410
<v Speaker 4>and she never.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She never id good for them.</v>

3861
02:54:05.660 --> 02:54:07.360
<v Speaker 4>You have to have laws.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3862
02:54:07.361 --> 02:54:08.650
<v Speaker 4>I think she's legal folks.</v>

3863
02:54:10.740 --> 02:54:14.410
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's flattering and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure she was happy.</v>

3864
02:54:14.810 --> 02:54:15.643
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think they have to mark down who you </v>

3865
02:54:17.591 --> 02:54:19.720
<v Speaker 4>are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They didn't pay.</v>

3866
02:54:19.730 --> 02:54:21.940
<v Speaker 4>Didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They just looked at your shit bro.</v>

3867
02:54:21.941 --> 02:54:23.170
<v Speaker 4>You don't even know Bro.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

3868
02:54:23.171 --> 02:54:27.520
<v Speaker 4>maybe bro.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bro.</v>

3869
02:54:27.521 --> 02:54:29.620
<v Speaker 4>You're right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tom.</v>

3870
02:54:30.690 --> 02:54:32.140
<v Speaker 4>We just did three hours,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

3871
02:54:32.530 --> 02:54:34.570
<v Speaker 4>We did already know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>

3872
02:54:34.780 --> 02:54:35.613
<v Speaker 4>This is a time where.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is part of the hive mentality is </v>

3873
02:54:38.230 --> 02:54:40.360
<v Speaker 4>we're missing this place.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what happens.</v>

3874
02:54:40.361 --> 02:54:41.620
<v Speaker 4>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is.</v>

3875
02:54:41.770 --> 02:54:45.100
<v Speaker 4>I'm worried that if we moved studios we </v>
<v Speaker 4>will lose that magic of three hours just</v>

3876
02:54:45.101 --> 02:54:46.840
<v Speaker 4>disappearing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When did you move out?</v>

3877
02:54:47.200 --> 02:54:48.033
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>bro.</v>
