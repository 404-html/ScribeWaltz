1
00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:05.730
We'll get you my two favorite rock stars on the wall.

2
00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.970
I had an Elvis tee shirt on earlier,
but I wear it so often,

3
00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.510
but that's Jimi Hendrix.
When he got arrested in Toronto for a,

4
00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.440
he had heroin on him.
And the Elvis picture is kind of a fake mugshot.
Okay.

5
00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:22.320
It wasn't earlier,
but I wear,
it's what happened.
That's me.
Whoops.
Uh,
that was,
uh,

6
00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.770
that was Elvis when he went to visit Nixon.
That famous picture.

7
00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:28.730
<v 1>Okay.
Again,
um,</v>

8
00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.790
that's how I ended up getting his pistol.

9
00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:36.920
<v 0>You got Elvis his pistol.
Yeah.
By the way,
people tuned in right now,
this is my,</v>

10
00:00:36.921 --> 00:00:38.870
the fucking Joe Perry from Aerosmith,

11
00:00:38.871 --> 00:00:42.110
one of the greatest guitarist that's ever graced the face of this planet.
Well,

12
00:00:42.111 --> 00:00:45.710
thanks.
It's an honor to be on you to have you on the show,
man.
Uh,
I,
you know,

13
00:00:45.711 --> 00:00:49.700
I grew up in Boston,
so Arrowsmith Boston synonymous,
you know,

14
00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:54.200
if you're a kid in Boston,
you're Aerosmith fan or you're some sort of communist.

15
00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.620
So I was an Aerosmith fan,
but you have Elvis's gun.

16
00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:58.940
How the fuck did you get out of this?
His Gun?

17
00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.710
<v 1>Well.
Um,
as it turns out,
um,</v>

18
00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.790
Joe Esposito,
who was his road manager from the time,

19
00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.390
I guess he met him in the army and from that time,

20
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.180
I guess he was the second person to find him when he died.
Um,

21
00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:19.090
so he was with them the whole time and uh,
he was his road manager and,

22
00:01:19.091 --> 00:01:22.850
uh,
he was with him the day that,
that they went to the,
uh,

23
00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.940
they took the Lisa Marie the plane to go visit Nixon and he wanted to give them

24
00:01:28.071 --> 00:01:32.530
that,
that commemorate of 1911,
which was in a box,

25
00:01:32.531 --> 00:01:34.180
but he knew he wouldn't get,

26
00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.720
get into the White House with his own carry gun.

27
00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:43.140
So he left it with his pilot,
you know,
on a,
on his airplanes.

28
00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:47.110
So,
uh,
they went in and they had their meeting and they,
you know,

29
00:01:47.111 --> 00:01:50.950
that's well documented and all in any way that they went back.

30
00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.460
And when the pilot cave,
you gave him back his pistol,

31
00:01:54.461 --> 00:01:57.820
he just turned around and gave it to Joe Esposito,
his road manager.

32
00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.700
And it's like,
just an average,

33
00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.590
like 38 from like the fifties was a lot of wear on the,
on the,
uh,

34
00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:07.840
on the holster,
you know?

35
00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.800
And so it looked like he'd worn quite a bit and used it quite a bit.

36
00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:15.310
<v 0>I bet he was calling that sucker out all the time.
Didn't he shoot a TV once?</v>

37
00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.840
You did all,
you miss all that stuff.
Who's mad at somebody?
Well,

38
00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.940
who was he mad at that like when Elvis shot the TV was a singer.
I've

39
00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.370
<v 1>uh,
Elliot Gould?
No,
not,
not only at cold.
Elliot.</v>

40
00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.130
What guy from Lowell?
I think.

41
00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:36.420
<v 0>Really?
Yeah,
the singer.
I Dunno.
It was one of those like a crooner what?</v>

42
00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.270
Robert Goulet.
You just guessing.
Don't do that.

43
00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:47.110
Yeah,
it was late.
Robert Goulet the actor,
wasn't he an act?
No,

44
00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.320
he was asleep.
He was,
the singer wasn't hearing it.
Robert Goulet an actor.

45
00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:53.800
I Dunno,
I don't,

46
00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.780
there's a James Brown who's a sports broadcaster change your name,
brother.

47
00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:00.200
That's ridiculous.

48
00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.033
<v 2>So,
you know,</v>

49
00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.990
<v 1>anyway,
so anyway,
the story goes that,
um,</v>

50
00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.510
that the Joe had this tucked away.
His pistol is 38.
And,
uh,

51
00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.100
and,
um,
he needed some cash and was going to put it online.

52
00:03:14.101 --> 00:03:19.070
And my road manager was,
which was also good friends with Joe,
um,

53
00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:22.620
heard about it and they said,
you know,

54
00:03:22.621 --> 00:03:25.050
and so he got in touch with Billy and you know,

55
00:03:25.051 --> 00:03:28.710
I always wanted something from Elvis,
you know,
I'm a big fan,
you know,

56
00:03:28.711 --> 00:03:30.630
but something that I know he used like,

57
00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:32.970
cause he's always buying stuff and you know,

58
00:03:32.971 --> 00:03:36.150
this stuff online that belonged to Elvis or gut,
you know,

59
00:03:36.151 --> 00:03:38.300
he bought it and then gave it to somebody.
And you know,

60
00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.460
I mean it doesn't really mean anything,
it's just,
you know,

61
00:03:41.461 --> 00:03:43.770
he just bought it and gave it to somebody as a gift.

62
00:03:43.771 --> 00:03:48.030
Never really like use it or touched it and like I'd be happy with a guitar

63
00:03:48.031 --> 00:03:52.410
string or a pig or something.
And so,
um,
um,

64
00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:57.450
you know,
and I collect guns,
I collect old old weapons,
you know,
whatever.

65
00:03:57.451 --> 00:04:00.030
And um,
so anyway,

66
00:04:00.031 --> 00:04:04.800
so my road manager heard about it and got in touch with Billy,
my wife,

67
00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:09.150
and they got together with Joe and did the,

68
00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.260
did the paperwork or whatever.
And I think it was for Christmas.

69
00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.010
Got Elvis 30.

70
00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:20.370
I haven't cleaned it or fired it or,
or done,
you know,

71
00:04:20.371 --> 00:04:24.480
I mean it's just,
I mean it's,
it's,
you know,

72
00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:27.240
it's just a treasure,
you know,

73
00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:30.720
and there's a letter of the clothes with it from Joe,
you know,

74
00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:34.110
Yvonne authenticity and uh,
and I,

75
00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:36.140
and I know that it's just by light,

76
00:04:36.141 --> 00:04:40.170
by looking at it and just experience and knowing what,
you know,

77
00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.700
guns look like after they've been used and everything.

78
00:04:42.701 --> 00:04:45.450
And it was probably that he,
he carried it,
you know,

79
00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:50.590
<v 2>Elvis was like the original real super superstar.</v>

80
00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:55.860
Like Elvis hit like a level of fame that probably no one will ever hit again.

81
00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:01.600
Like he hit this creek because this is no internet limited amount of television.

82
00:05:01.601 --> 00:05:03.370
There's only a few channels.
So you know,

83
00:05:03.371 --> 00:05:06.790
you had the Ed Sullivan show when a couple of other shows and the tonight show,

84
00:05:06.791 --> 00:05:07.624
but when,

85
00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:12.340
what the level of fame that Elvis reached was like this really bizarre kind of

86
00:05:12.341 --> 00:05:13.174
crazy level.

87
00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:18.300
And so all the other musicians like yourself and a lot of other folks got to see

88
00:05:18.641 --> 00:05:19.870
like what can happen.

89
00:05:19.871 --> 00:05:24.040
How it can all go off the rails with the great Elvis Presley,
you know,

90
00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:27.760
<v 1>you know,
it was really,
it was really something,
I mean,</v>

91
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.740
considering his background,
I mean,
and the age that he was when he,

92
00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:37.470
when he,
when it hit,
I mean,
again,
it was like,
I'm sure he did his,

93
00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:41.740
you know,
he played his gigs at clubs and things that,
whatever,
you know,

94
00:05:41.741 --> 00:05:45.940
for his friends,
but then it was,
if there was ever like an overnight thing,

95
00:05:45.941 --> 00:05:48.760
I mean,
you think about the Beatles.
I mean,
people think,

96
00:05:48.761 --> 00:05:53.140
well they will kind of an overnight success.
I mean,
that was what the media said,

97
00:05:53.141 --> 00:05:57.220
but you know,
they spent a lot of time in the clubs,
men and like at Hamburg,

98
00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:01.900
like three years playing,
you know,
absurd hours,
you know,

99
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.540
you know,
constantly.
I mean,
they really worked hard to be a good van,

100
00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:10.730
a great band,
you know,
as,
as well as being as talented as they were.
But,

101
00:06:10.731 --> 00:06:15.050
um,
uh,
and you know,
are,
but,
uh,
um,

102
00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:20.490
Elvis,
it kind of hit him right away,
man.
And,
uh,
I dunno how he,

103
00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:22.280
he,
well we can see how he dealt with it.

104
00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:23.430
<v 2>You know,
I didn't do so well.</v>

105
00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:26.050
I don't think anybody can deal with that level of fame.

106
00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:30.160
I think it just makes you,
it's your reality.
Just changes.

107
00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:35.050
Like it's like being taken from Earth and being dropped off in an alternate

108
00:06:35.051 --> 00:06:38.530
dimension where everybody knows who you are.
People scream when they see you.

109
00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:40.860
Everywhere you go.
Women are fainting.
I mean,

110
00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:43.600
there'd never been a person alive like that.

111
00:06:43.601 --> 00:06:46.750
There'd never been a person a lie before Elvis where were they would walk on

112
00:06:46.751 --> 00:06:50.410
stage and women would drop.
They look,
frank.

113
00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:53.490
Frank had a taste of it,
but the media was not true.

114
00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:58.470
<v 1>Well it wasn't as big as it is getting with Elvis because the whole thing was</v>

115
00:06:58.471 --> 00:07:02.760
like evolving,
you know,
so they,
it was more,
more of an output,
you know,

116
00:07:02.761 --> 00:07:07.530
it was more,
I mean [inaudible] still,
I mean,
he was,
you know,

117
00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:12.490
arguably the got the man,
I mean he had the movies,
he had the,
the,
the,

118
00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:17.880
the singing,
you know,
and everything.
And,
and the girls to that with him too.

119
00:07:17.881 --> 00:07:22.590
But it wasn't as,
as,
as intense as Elvis because of the,
uh,

120
00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:26.190
because of TV and radio and the,
you know,

121
00:07:26.191 --> 00:07:31.191
and him getting out there and really concentrating on just playing in the states

122
00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:33.360
who God knows what would've happened if he was,

123
00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:38.630
if he would been allowed to tour the world,
you know,
but,
but you know,

124
00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:41.550
there's all the stories about the colonel,
you know,

125
00:07:41.551 --> 00:07:45.840
keeping them in the country because he was afraid that if he was to go out of

126
00:07:45.841 --> 00:07:50.340
the country,
um,
he wasn't able to go with him because of his,

127
00:07:50.341 --> 00:07:51.390
it was background,

128
00:07:51.391 --> 00:07:56.370
I guess he couldn't get a passport or something and record apparently.
And uh,

129
00:07:56.670 --> 00:08:01.230
and so he was afraid someone would get to him and would take over as new

130
00:08:01.231 --> 00:08:05.590
manager.
Well,
he was always a friend.
I mean,
he kept,
it kept him away from,

131
00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:10.440
from the,
all the new technology that was going on in,
in rock and roll.
I mean,

132
00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:13.890
right down to the,
to the stage lights and all that stuff.
I mean,

133
00:08:13.891 --> 00:08:18.660
he has his show stayed pretty much the same all through it.

134
00:08:18.690 --> 00:08:23.340
I mean,
they had,
I mean,
the kernel kept everything just the way it was.

135
00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:25.040
It's fine.
And all of this was fine with it,

136
00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:29.880
but he never really saw like what people were doing,
say in the 70s,
you know,

137
00:08:29.881 --> 00:08:33.780
with rock and roll and how the show's got big and there was so much more he

138
00:08:33.781 --> 00:08:38.280
could do.
But he was isolated so,
so much from it all.
I mean,

139
00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:43.290
he was kept away from the best songwriters.
Um,
really,
you know,
it was really,

140
00:08:43.291 --> 00:08:45.660
it's really a shame.
I mean,
you know,
and you know,

141
00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:48.660
the stories that are true about him,
you know,

142
00:08:48.661 --> 00:08:51.240
not being able to act in the movies he wanted to.
I mean,

143
00:08:51.241 --> 00:08:55.830
he's obviously a talented actors.
It never had a chance,
some good,

144
00:08:55.890 --> 00:09:00.280
good roles.
And,
uh,
why was that?
Well,
that was because of the kernel as well.

145
00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:04.650
Pretty much the colonel kept him in a,
in a box,
you know what I mean?

146
00:09:04.651 --> 00:09:09.060
They had the system worked out where they would get x amount of dollars up front

147
00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:12.870
and they knew how much,
you know,
how much money they would make from the movies.

148
00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:16.860
And then,
um,
you know,
they had the circuit,
then they would put out the,

149
00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:21.780
this batch of songs,
you know,
most of them,
you know,
just throw it all thrown off,

150
00:09:21.781 --> 00:09:25.340
recorded in three days,
whatever,
you know.
And he just,

151
00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:29.250
they just had the system and then the colonel allegedly would take this

152
00:09:29.251 --> 00:09:33.000
briefcase,
his,
his share and go right to Vegas

153
00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:38.960
<v 0>and then he'd go back to back to la with an empty briefcase,
you know,</v>

154
00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:42.590
and then it was Elvis.
It's time for another movie.
Uh,

155
00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:47.570
colonel was a gambling junkie.
All that was,
that's a story that makes sense.

156
00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:48.750
That makes sense.

157
00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:52.700
In Sinatra also had a different style of music that as the rock and roll was

158
00:09:52.701 --> 00:09:57.160
coming along,
his style of music was a generation before,
you know.
And for,

159
00:09:57.260 --> 00:10:01.370
for folks who haven't heard the early Sinatra stuff,
it's kind of shocking.

160
00:10:01.710 --> 00:10:06.680
Like the early Sinatra's voice was really high pitched and almost like it

161
00:10:06.681 --> 00:10:06.980
didn't,

162
00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:11.330
doesn't sound like you've heard Sinatra pull up early Sinatra see if you could

163
00:10:11.331 --> 00:10:16.040
find some real old school Sinatra because he had this like,

164
00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:18.330
I don't want to say like a falsetto,

165
00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:22.220
but it was like a very high pitched voice and he could hit these incredible

166
00:10:22.221 --> 00:10:25.670
notes.
But all that Jack Daniel's and the cigarettes,

167
00:10:25.671 --> 00:10:29.270
they changed it to this baby.
You know,
he became,

168
00:10:29.271 --> 00:10:33.070
I got you under my skin,
came like,
uh,

169
00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:36.020
he was more talkative than he was singing it wholly kind of.

170
00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:40.160
He kind of realized there was,
there was this,
this persona that he could,

171
00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:43.670
he could grow into,
you know,
and I think that,
that,

172
00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:48.080
<v 1>that,
that's a part of it.
You know what I mean?
He realized that he was the,</v>

173
00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:48.770
you know,

174
00:10:48.770 --> 00:10:53.600
he was hanging with these guys who were like looked at as the coolest guys on

175
00:10:53.601 --> 00:10:57.740
the planet.
He was,
he was basically the boss,
you know what I mean?

176
00:10:57.741 --> 00:11:00.920
And that pack right there and then,
and you know,

177
00:11:00.921 --> 00:11:05.180
they had their restaurants and places they would hang in the broads.

178
00:11:05.181 --> 00:11:09.920
And the booze and the Martinis and,
uh,
you know,
whatever's,
you know,
and,
uh,

179
00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:14.180
that was,
uh,
that was his thing.
And that's,
that's what,
that's what he,
he,
he was,

180
00:11:14.210 --> 00:11:15.043
he lived at,

181
00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:16.340
<v 0>yeah.
Let me hear this.</v>

182
00:11:18.490 --> 00:11:23.420
Must have raw is the devil's raw cause all my,

183
00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:29.600
I make a day isn't that weird.

184
00:11:29.601 --> 00:11:34.040
Can singing like bing Crosby,
you know what I mean?
But that was,

185
00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:37.640
you know,
he's kind of finding his place.
Yeah.

186
00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:41.340
<v 1>And then,
uh,
you know,
you can hear it the way he's singing.
He just,</v>

187
00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:44.280
it's just drips.
Cool.
You know,

188
00:11:44.281 --> 00:11:48.870
when he found his voice and he found his niche and,
and his,
his,

189
00:11:48.930 --> 00:11:51.660
uh,
in his,
in his public persona,
you know,

190
00:11:51.850 --> 00:11:54.000
<v 0>is,
he's got some where he rec,</v>

191
00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:57.880
<v 2>he demonstrates this incredible range too with his voice.
I mean,</v>

192
00:11:57.881 --> 00:12:01.520
he could hit these amazing notes that a lot of people don't do.

193
00:12:01.570 --> 00:12:06.190
You don't think of when you think of Sinatra,
you know,
you think of,
uh,
all the,

194
00:12:06.191 --> 00:12:08.890
the different classic hits that he had right now,

195
00:12:08.970 --> 00:12:13.970
but these really old songs show you what he could have been or what he

196
00:12:14.621 --> 00:12:18.210
originally was and that you can get to see the,
the morphing of it all.
Yeah.

197
00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:23.180
<v 3>Yeah.
Well,
again,
that's probably why.
Um,
again,
he didn't,</v>

198
00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:27.810
I mean he,
he had,
he was at the time considering the technology and how,

199
00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:32.720
how people got their,
their entertainment.
He got as big as anybody could get.

200
00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:37.410
<v 2>Yeah.
He was,
he was about as big as it could get back then.
You know,
he,</v>

201
00:12:37.690 --> 00:12:41.970
he's here his vocal range.
That's it.
Yeah.
That's it.
I'm gonna hear this.

202
00:12:45.730 --> 00:12:49.610
Is this,
this is the older one.
Yeah.
It's,

203
00:12:49.650 --> 00:12:50.920
I think it's showing all the different,
yeah.

204
00:12:50.990 --> 00:12:51.823
<v 4>Well,
Brenda,</v>

205
00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:02.140
<v 2>yeah.
This is not the young guy though.
You just want to find the young one,</v>

206
00:13:02.170 --> 00:13:04.270
which is what the most interesting thing.
I got his,
uh,

207
00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:08.130
his mugshot on my wall as well.
Oh yeah.
At home.
Yeah.
He,
uh,

208
00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:12.340
was arrested for seduction.
Really?
Yeah.
Whatever that means.

209
00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:16.180
Probably given the old schlump veal,
the someone's wife,
you know what I'm saying?

210
00:13:16.690 --> 00:13:19.840
But he was really young too.
And uh,
he was tiny.

211
00:13:19.841 --> 00:13:23.560
He was like 125 pounds I think,
in the mugshot.
Wow.
Yeah.

212
00:13:23.561 --> 00:13:26.740
Let me pull that up cause it was tied our,
yeah,
he was a tiny little good.

213
00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:29.320
Yeah.
Sinatra,

214
00:13:29.830 --> 00:13:34.480
<v 3>well a man with the golden arm,
right?
No,
that was,
that was,
uh,
was that,</v>

215
00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:39.350
was he an I don't remember.
There we go.
The man with the golden voice,

216
00:13:39.351 --> 00:13:42.890
right?
Wasn't it?
Well,
yeah,
that too,
but I mean he did that move you there?

217
00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:47.870
<v 2>He was arrested in 1938 charged with carrying on with a married woman.</v>

218
00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:52.310
That was illegal carrying on with a married woman.

219
00:13:52.450 --> 00:13:56.480
What does carrying on me is that lasers Janice Freak on?
Well,
I mean,
you know,

220
00:13:56.570 --> 00:13:58.430
I mean,
how do you define that in court?
I mean,

221
00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:01.130
all you have to do is be chick pea with a married woman,
I guess.

222
00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:05.810
Probably like alone and you're carrying on.
That's all you have to do.

223
00:14:05.811 --> 00:14:06.320
Back then,

224
00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:10.250
probably 1938 they were terrified of everything and now they probably thought I

225
00:14:10.251 --> 00:14:13.190
could summon a demon will carry on with a married woman.

226
00:14:13.191 --> 00:14:15.230
They didn't know anything back then.
They didn't have the Internet.

227
00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:17.270
They only had like four books.
Watch out.

228
00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:21.390
Watch out who you get on the elevator with,
you know?
Yeah.
Watch how he get,

229
00:14:22.050 --> 00:14:24.800
definitely football players don't get in the elevator with football players.

230
00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:30.080
They tend to get a little smacky.
Yeah,
he was 125 pounds,
I think.

231
00:14:30.081 --> 00:14:31.920
It doesn't say it here.
It doesn't show,
but I have the,

232
00:14:31.921 --> 00:14:35.630
the piece of paper that came with it.
Like the,
the charged him.

233
00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:41.150
Jesus.
Yeah.
They sell it at like one of these poster shops.

234
00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:46.150
It's hilarious though.
Uh,
when you,

235
00:14:46.151 --> 00:14:48.940
when you had a chance to see guys like Elvis,

236
00:14:48.941 --> 00:14:53.720
when you were a kid and you had a chance to see those guys and all the trials

237
00:14:53.721 --> 00:14:56.960
and tribulations they went through and all the pitfalls,
did you,

238
00:14:56.961 --> 00:15:00.920
did you get a chance to learn from some,
some of that stuff?
Did it,
would that,

239
00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:03.110
do you think that that like helped you in any way?

240
00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:05.950
<v 1>Um,
I think that it is</v>

241
00:15:07.810 --> 00:15:11.210
one of those things that I just been being young,
arrogant,

242
00:15:11.211 --> 00:15:15.070
and 18 you think anything could have happened to me,
you know?

243
00:15:15.130 --> 00:15:17.230
I mean that was kind of the vibe.
I mean,
I just,

244
00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:20.380
plus I couldn't relate to it because I never saw it in person.

245
00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:23.360
He was always like,
had that illusion of,
you know,

246
00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:26.950
cause it was on TV and that you always had that feeling like there's something

247
00:15:26.951 --> 00:15:31.750
in there that's going on behind behind the scenes or whatever.

248
00:15:31.751 --> 00:15:35.620
And it's,
it makes it more than it is,

249
00:15:35.621 --> 00:15:36.970
it makes it bigger than life.

250
00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:41.410
And so it's really hard to relate to for just,
you know,

251
00:15:41.470 --> 00:15:45.780
like your average person,
which I was at the time,
you know,
just sitting there,

252
00:15:46.350 --> 00:15:50.860
you know,
without knowing anybody famous or you know,
or anything like that.

253
00:15:50.861 --> 00:15:54.280
I mean,
it was like something you saw on TV or heard on the radio.

254
00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:59.170
So I couldn't really relate to it in a,
in a,
in a visceral way,
in a real way,

255
00:15:59.171 --> 00:16:03.760
you know?
So,
uh,
it just was one of those things that you just,
I mean,

256
00:16:04.270 --> 00:16:07.090
I never saw like a,
uh,

257
00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:10.590
an alcoholic or anything like that and you know,
you know,

258
00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:15.820
w w in person till till I actually like hung out with the dolls the new year

259
00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:22.930
except for lead on like a homeless person here or there.
And that was it,

260
00:16:22.990 --> 00:16:24.610
you know.
So,
uh,

261
00:16:24.690 --> 00:16:29.410
now it's pretty naive and uh,
you know,
when I was growing up,

262
00:16:29.810 --> 00:16:33.590
<v 2>I was real lucky when I was a kid that I did a lot of construction.</v>

263
00:16:33.710 --> 00:16:37.710
My stepfather was an architect,
so he got me on a lot of construction sites for,

264
00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:41.660
for jobs.
And I got around a lot of junkies,

265
00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:43.940
a lot of junkies and a lot of alcoholics.

266
00:16:43.941 --> 00:16:48.470
And I got to see these guys just destroying their lives.
I get to see guys who,

267
00:16:49.190 --> 00:16:51.060
you know,
they'd be clean,
they'd be clean and be clean.

268
00:16:51.061 --> 00:16:53.990
And then one day they didn't have a beer at work.
You know,

269
00:16:53.991 --> 00:16:56.270
they would just show up with a beer,
like wrapped up in a,

270
00:16:56.300 --> 00:17:00.050
in a paper bag and then they would go off the rails and then they would not show

271
00:17:00.051 --> 00:17:03.050
up at work and everybody would make fun of them on the job.

272
00:17:03.051 --> 00:17:06.650
And I just got to see these people that just couldn't control substances.

273
00:17:07.190 --> 00:17:10.100
And being around that,
I got to,
you know,
as a young kid,

274
00:17:10.101 --> 00:17:14.720
as a young teenager was like all my summer jobs where construction gigs and I

275
00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:19.220
got to see like people ruin their lives.
And I remember thinking to myself,
okay,

276
00:17:19.310 --> 00:17:20.870
this is something I got to,
I got to learn from that.

277
00:17:20.871 --> 00:17:22.640
And I don't want to be that guy.
You know,

278
00:17:22.790 --> 00:17:26.000
this is a good thing about seeing people fuck up is that if you're paying

279
00:17:26.001 --> 00:17:27.860
attention,
it really can help you.

280
00:17:28.010 --> 00:17:30.710
It really can absorb that if you're paying attention.

281
00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:35.090
But I guess what you're saying is that like seeing it on TV,

282
00:17:35.091 --> 00:17:39.620
whether it's Elvis or anybody else that did it,
like Janis Joplin or Hendrix,

283
00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:43.400
you know,
dying of heroin overdoses or whatever,
and choking on their own vomit.

284
00:17:43.550 --> 00:17:45.800
It doesn't seem like it's going to happen to you cause you're not,

285
00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:48.950
it's not like your buddy.
Like you know what exactly.

286
00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:54.060
I had a buddy in high school and uh,
his cousin was a coke dealer and a,

287
00:17:54.070 --> 00:17:58.980
I got to see this guy just waste away.
He went from being this like normal,

288
00:17:58.981 --> 00:18:03.570
fun loving guy to constantly just tucked away in.

289
00:18:03.570 --> 00:18:04.650
He had an attic apartment.

290
00:18:04.651 --> 00:18:07.530
Him and his girlfriend would just do coke and watch TV.
They were just,

291
00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:11.330
they just vanished.
He just shriveled up to nothing.
Like he,

292
00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:14.100
I mean he must have lost like he was a skinny guy already,

293
00:18:14.101 --> 00:18:15.930
but he must have lost like 30 or 40 pounds.

294
00:18:15.931 --> 00:18:20.100
Just whittled away to this little non eating coke,

295
00:18:20.101 --> 00:18:24.930
snorting TV,
watching Weirdo God.
And uh,
I remember thinking to myself,

296
00:18:24.931 --> 00:18:28.830
nope,
never going to try that shit.
But I was lucky.

297
00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:31.260
I was lucky that I got to see that.
I got to see it with my eye.

298
00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:35.900
<v 3>Yeah.
At an age did it,
did it made an impression,
you know?
Yeah.</v>

299
00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:39.170
<v 2>Yeah.
If I wasn't,
if I was around only nice people,
it did nice things,</v>

300
00:18:39.171 --> 00:18:42.320
I probably would've been like cocaine.
What's that?
What'd you guys get that?

301
00:18:43.310 --> 00:18:46.800
<v 3>Yeah,
well it was,
uh,
definitely,
uh,
uh,</v>

302
00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:49.060
there was definitely proud of that and my use,

303
00:18:49.070 --> 00:18:52.490
I mean there's definitely isolated in a very small town.
I mean,

304
00:18:52.540 --> 00:18:55.520
it just wasn't that kind of thing as I was growing up.

305
00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:58.310
What town did you grow up in and hope they'll Massachusetts,

306
00:18:58.311 --> 00:19:01.610
which is probably about a 30,

307
00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:06.680
40 minutes away from a Fox sport where the Patriots play for anybody who doesn't

308
00:19:06.681 --> 00:19:08.750
know Boston at all,
you know?
So,
uh,

309
00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:13.400
it was just way out in the suburbs,
you know,
not,

310
00:19:13.401 --> 00:19:16.920
not like just 10 minutes,
you know what I mean?
It took a,
it was a,

311
00:19:16.940 --> 00:19:20.570
it was like a couple hour trek to get into town,
you know,
into Boston.

312
00:19:20.571 --> 00:19:25.571
And I didn't start going into in there until I was probably 15 or 16 years old.

313
00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:29.810
My mother would drive us to the,
to the nearest train,
stop,

314
00:19:29.811 --> 00:19:34.430
and we'd take the train in and hang around all day and then take the train back

315
00:19:34.431 --> 00:19:35.450
out.
And she would meet us.

316
00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:39.860
And you never lost your Boston accent while I still have a little bit of quite a

317
00:19:39.861 --> 00:19:43.400
bit of it.
Did you on the radio?
I feel like if I didn't know who you were,

318
00:19:43.401 --> 00:19:46.460
I'd be like,
Oh that guy's from Boston,
you know,
for sure it's not,

319
00:19:46.461 --> 00:19:50.960
what if I'm home for awhile,
then you'll,
it really sinks in.

320
00:19:50.970 --> 00:19:54.650
I said talking to my friends and then it really comes back.
But I kind of have,

321
00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:57.350
you know,
kind of by coastal,
you know,

322
00:19:58.220 --> 00:20:01.040
La in there and a lot of Midwestern,
cause Billy,

323
00:20:01.041 --> 00:20:03.410
my wife is from the Midwest and you know,

324
00:20:03.470 --> 00:20:07.450
so it kind of kind of smooths that out a little bit once in a while was,

325
00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:12.620
you know,
it's like,
I forgot what the letter I saw it sounds like.
And uh,
uh,

326
00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:17.570
it's um,
uh,
when I was reading the audio book,
I was,

327
00:20:18.070 --> 00:20:23.070
I was afraid to that too much of it would get in there or maybe they should be

328
00:20:23.181 --> 00:20:25.910
more of it.
I don't know.
I just,
I just didn't,

329
00:20:25.911 --> 00:20:29.920
I just gave up on it and just kind of got through it.
You know?

330
00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:31.040
<v 2>Yeah.
It's one of the,</v>

331
00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:34.880
it's a one o those weird accents that people kind of don't like to have.

332
00:20:34.881 --> 00:20:36.950
For some reason,
I didn't like to have it.
I got rid of mine.

333
00:20:37.250 --> 00:20:40.610
I heard myself on TV when I was 19 and I was like,
Jesus Christ,

334
00:20:40.611 --> 00:20:43.850
I sound like that.
I was like,
well,
really,
we were really working had,

335
00:20:43.851 --> 00:20:48.040
and I was like,
oh no.
Is that me?
Uh,
but uh,
when I drink

336
00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:50.780
<v 0>it comes out,
it's still write a little bit,
a little bit.
Definitely.</v>

337
00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:52.030
Or if you're on the road,

338
00:20:52.031 --> 00:20:55.180
I've noticed that like if we go back to Boston and I seed,

339
00:20:55.530 --> 00:20:58.690
if we go back to Boston,
I drink with Mike Savage friends from high school.

340
00:20:58.810 --> 00:21:01.750
I remember those animals we met at a,
the common connection.
One night,

341
00:21:01.751 --> 00:21:03.040
if I go drinking with them,

342
00:21:03.041 --> 00:21:05.680
it'll probably come out four or five beers in and it's out.

343
00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:10.350
<v 1>Well,
Liz,
there's guys that do a whole comedians that do a whole,</v>

344
00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:12.800
the whole routine is,
is all about the bus.

345
00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:17.180
<v 0>Steve Sweeney?
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
You know Steve Sweeney?
That's right.</v>

346
00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:19.360
He's a riot.
Oh,
one of the greatest of all time.

347
00:21:19.670 --> 00:21:22.980
It's a goddamn shame that people don't know who that guy is.
Pac Man,

348
00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:27.630
if you're from Boston,
you go to see Steve Sweeney.

349
00:21:27.631 --> 00:21:30.150
He thinks he's the funniest dude has ever walked the face of the planet.
Oh yeah.

350
00:21:30.570 --> 00:21:34.480
But it's like so much of it was Boston centered when he would leave and go out

351
00:21:34.481 --> 00:21:36.790
of town,
the people didn't know what the fuck he was talking about.

352
00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:41.110
<v 1>Right.
Oh yeah.
That,
that was the one thing,
you know,
that,
that he had a truck,</v>

353
00:21:41.170 --> 00:21:45.950
we had trouble,
like making it out of that,
that area.
You know.

354
00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:50.290
How old were you when,
when Aerosmith cracked?
Well,
I'd say a

355
00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:53.810
good cracked,
that's an interesting word.

356
00:21:54.010 --> 00:21:58.850
When you take through public consciousness came huge.
It took us,
took us a while,

357
00:21:58.851 --> 00:22:03.140
man.
I mean there were places where we could sell out in Boston load arenas and,

358
00:22:03.141 --> 00:22:08.090
and uh,
well actually Detroit was the first town that really took us in.

359
00:22:08.091 --> 00:22:09.390
Really?
Yeah.
Cause it,

360
00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:14.150
cause the Detroit was known as like they'll rock city,
you know,

361
00:22:14.151 --> 00:22:17.960
they at the Mc five and the stooges,
I mean hardcore rock and uh,

362
00:22:18.380 --> 00:22:21.740
and they love j.
Geils was,
you know,
in my mind,

363
00:22:21.741 --> 00:22:26.690
one of the best live bands ever and his band I ever saw live man.
I mean,

364
00:22:27.350 --> 00:22:30.020
they're just so good.
I mean,
you just great.
You know,

365
00:22:30.021 --> 00:22:33.350
and I can remember seeing them when they actually started their thing where they

366
00:22:33.351 --> 00:22:36.860
would start with just three guys on stage and then another guy would come up in

367
00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:41.690
other guy and then Peter would finish his radio show and come down and blow

368
00:22:41.691 --> 00:22:45.830
everybody away with the last four songs or whatever.
And um,

369
00:22:46.190 --> 00:22:51.050
so anyway,
they went to Detroit,
they own Detroit.
And so when we were,

370
00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:55.130
we were,
you know,
making our way through it,
play in the clubs and you know,

371
00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:58.100
Pennsylvania,
Ohio,
whatever.
When we hit Detroit,

372
00:22:58.190 --> 00:23:03.140
Detroit was ready to hear another band from Boston because they loved j Geils.

373
00:23:03.141 --> 00:23:06.050
They kind of paved the way for us,
you know,
so we would,

374
00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:11.080
we went to Detroit and g over the course of six months.

375
00:23:12.050 --> 00:23:16.850
One of the single got rereleased and then we went back to Boston and all of a

376
00:23:16.851 --> 00:23:20.150
sudden we were filling clubs and Phil,
and it was,
it was,

377
00:23:20.390 --> 00:23:24.350
I was probably 20,
21 when that started to happen.

378
00:23:24.550 --> 00:23:29.380
<v 0>Wow.
21 and 21 when it all started to really come together.</v>

379
00:23:29.410 --> 00:23:33.280
I mean,
what a crazy thing to deal with at 21.

380
00:23:33.730 --> 00:23:37.860
<v 1>Well,
yeah,
it doesn't seem that,
I mean now,
I dunno man.</v>

381
00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:41.830
Um,
I mean what worked a long while to get it there,

382
00:23:41.831 --> 00:23:45.560
but still there were places we could go and still be like third on the bill

383
00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:49.400
right now.
And so we'd have to like conquer Texas,
you know what I mean?

384
00:23:49.410 --> 00:23:53.900
Or conquer,
conquer Florida,
you know,
and uh,
um,

385
00:23:53.930 --> 00:23:56.990
cause we really didn't get much love from the,
from the critics and the,

386
00:23:56.991 --> 00:24:00.890
and all that.
And uh,
but the fans were there,
you know,
and there were all,

387
00:24:00.950 --> 00:24:05.030
they had heard about us or hurt us and they'd be singing along with the,

388
00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:09.360
with the,
with the record.
And
finally we,
we,

389
00:24:09.630 --> 00:24:11.540
we could go anywhere in the states.

390
00:24:11.820 --> 00:24:14.440
<v 2>Well when you guys hit,
you guys were a force of nature.</v>

391
00:24:14.441 --> 00:24:17.650
I mean it's like seriously one of the greatest bands of all time.
I mean,

392
00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:20.350
it's gotta be an amazing thing to be a part of,

393
00:24:20.740 --> 00:24:22.570
one of the greatest bands of all time.

394
00:24:22.571 --> 00:24:25.030
I mean it's got to feel surreal and in some ways,

395
00:24:25.210 --> 00:24:30.070
<v 1>well I sometimes I can't relate to it.
I mean frankly,
I mean it's really,
really,</v>

396
00:24:30.490 --> 00:24:35.230
I mean they read off the,
the things,
you know,
I mean lately,
you know,
doing the,

397
00:24:35.950 --> 00:24:38.770
the press tour and stuff for the book and all that and they'll read these

398
00:24:38.860 --> 00:24:40.070
statistics and I,

399
00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:43.390
this stuff in there that I don't even know cause I don't read that.

400
00:24:43.690 --> 00:24:45.160
Really get into that stuff.
Yeah.

401
00:24:45.340 --> 00:24:50.230
<v 2>Two guys had some,
some hits that were just so fucking bad ass,</v>

402
00:24:50.620 --> 00:24:54.160
you know,
I mean to this day,
to this day I hear train,

403
00:24:54.180 --> 00:24:57.520
keep a rolling crane kept rolling.
God Damn,
that's a good song.

404
00:24:57.730 --> 00:25:00.040
It's so many songs that were so good.

405
00:25:00.430 --> 00:25:05.430
Like every now and then a band comes along that has like this real,

406
00:25:06.340 --> 00:25:10.120
like obviously ACDC has a very ACDC songs.

407
00:25:10.390 --> 00:25:15.340
There's a sound ACDC,
but with your guitar plan and Tyler's vocals,

408
00:25:15.341 --> 00:25:19.800
you guys had such a distinctive sound like you could hear,

409
00:25:19.890 --> 00:25:22.090
I'm going the first couple like walk this way.

410
00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:26.290
You can hear the first couple notes that this is a Goddamn Aerosmith song.

411
00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:29.860
There's like a thing to it,
like a feeling that you heard when you listen to it.

412
00:25:30.370 --> 00:25:32.320
And I mean when I was a kid,
dude,

413
00:25:32.590 --> 00:25:34.810
we're in high school and we were play your songs.

414
00:25:34.811 --> 00:25:39.300
You know back then everybody had boom boxes.
I used to walk to a,

415
00:25:39.310 --> 00:25:43.690
I worked at Newport creameries ice cream place and I used to walk with a boombox

416
00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:47.500
on my shoulder.
That's how you listened to music.

417
00:25:47.501 --> 00:25:49.270
Nobody had any other way to listen to music.

418
00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:51.790
So take this fucking boom box and my shoulder.

419
00:25:51.790 --> 00:25:53.990
<v 1>Well the cassette right?
Yeah.</v>

420
00:25:54.190 --> 00:25:55.880
<v 2>Yeah because that's where big.
We're very excited.</v>

421
00:25:55.881 --> 00:25:57.230
We didn't have eight tracks back then.

422
00:25:58.630 --> 00:26:00.920
<v 1>I went,
the eight tracks were amazing.</v>

423
00:26:00.921 --> 00:26:04.160
I can remember hearing one once and the guys that would cause,

424
00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:08.150
cause they only have so much,
you know,
before they switched and they would,

425
00:26:08.151 --> 00:26:11.750
they would edit the songs.
They wouldn't be listening to the songs.

426
00:26:11.990 --> 00:26:14.470
They would just edit it because at the time was up,
you know,

427
00:26:14.471 --> 00:26:17.780
so I'll have to have to five minutes on one,
you know,
one track,

428
00:26:17.781 --> 00:26:21.860
it would click and then like in the,
in the middle of a verse,

429
00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:26.920
it would just fade away and then it would fade back in after it and switch to

430
00:26:27.681 --> 00:26:30.150
the next.
It was,
you know,

431
00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:35.090
just some guy at Columbia,
you know,
another,

432
00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:37.700
another tape or another album.
You just,
okay,

433
00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:42.560
well the stopwatch and he would just click it over and it was really frustrating

434
00:26:42.590 --> 00:26:44.010
to hear it.
That or

435
00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:48.600
<v 3>the middle of a guitar Solo,
you go,
wait a second.
That's my favorite,
you know?</v>

436
00:26:48.601 --> 00:26:51.460
And we had no control over that,
you know?

437
00:26:51.550 --> 00:26:55.270
<v 2>Yeah.
It was so archaic in a way.
But you,</v>

438
00:26:55.310 --> 00:27:00.020
you go back now and you think about it,
it's the transition.

439
00:27:00.021 --> 00:27:05.021
But from a track two cassette to CD to where we are today with digital music,

440
00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:10.660
it seems so fast when you look at it in terms of like the history of the world.

441
00:27:10.690 --> 00:27:12.760
It's like a blink of the eye.

442
00:27:13.060 --> 00:27:18.060
And we went from this thing that's not spool to some shit that's in the cloud.

443
00:27:18.100 --> 00:27:20.650
I mean,
it really,
it happened like that.

444
00:27:20.820 --> 00:27:22.260
<v 3>It's like money.
It's just there.</v>

445
00:27:22.330 --> 00:27:26.710
<v 2>Yeah.
I mean in all,
in our lifetime it changed so fast.
It's so,</v>

446
00:27:26.770 --> 00:27:31.030
so much,
it seems like a long time ago to us.
But in the,

447
00:27:31.031 --> 00:27:34.390
in the sense of like the human race,
it's nothing,
it's no time at all.

448
00:27:34.570 --> 00:27:37.740
<v 3>Well,
it's funny,
over the last couple of days people have handed me,
um,</v>

449
00:27:39.490 --> 00:27:42.180
vinyl a gap and it's like,
uh,
I don't,

450
00:27:42.190 --> 00:27:45.780
of course I don't have a turntable where I'm staying and,
uh,

451
00:27:46.140 --> 00:27:49.090
but I'm thinking of going and picking one up,
a small one and those small,

452
00:27:49.270 --> 00:27:53.530
you know,
portable ones,
just so I can listen to what's on the,
on the vinyl.

453
00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:56.600
<v 2>Yeah.
Sturgill Simpson gave us,
they're tucked away.
They're in the back.</v>

454
00:27:56.870 --> 00:28:00.730
Sturgill Simpson is this fucking badass country singer who's on,
um,

455
00:28:00.890 --> 00:28:02.690
he's on tonight on the Jimmy Fallon show.

456
00:28:02.900 --> 00:28:06.170
He was on last week and he gave me these vinyls and it made me want to go get a

457
00:28:06.410 --> 00:28:08.330
record player and I think I'm going to do it.

458
00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:10.880
I'm going to dive and get one for here.
Right.
She get one for here.

459
00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:15.400
<v 3>I mean you don't need to spend a ton of money and they're only like a good one.</v>

460
00:28:15.401 --> 00:28:19.270
There's only a couple hundred bucks and they're coming back.
Yeah.
Hey,
it's great.

461
00:28:19.540 --> 00:28:20.230
It's one of my,

462
00:28:20.230 --> 00:28:23.860
one of my favorite things to do is go downstairs from my office and I got some

463
00:28:23.861 --> 00:28:28.861
old old studio monitors that are like 40 years old and I've got $200 a turn

464
00:28:30.450 --> 00:28:32.740
table and a little damp and that's it.

465
00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:36.640
And I got the old Hendrix records and stuff.
And of course they,

466
00:28:36.890 --> 00:28:40.240
they still like crackle and scratch and all that.
But man,

467
00:28:40.540 --> 00:28:44.530
there's so much sound to that to that and so much warmth.
It's amazing.

468
00:28:44.620 --> 00:28:48.070
<v 2>That's exactly how steroid will described it.
He described it as a warmth.
Yeah.</v>

469
00:28:48.190 --> 00:28:51.830
I don't understand cause I'm,
I'm musically retarded.
So yeah,
but it's mission.
You

470
00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:54.130
<v 3>just know what you like.
That's all I know.
What I like.
That's it.</v>

471
00:28:54.131 --> 00:28:57.770
That's all it matters.
Yeah.
It doesn't have to be.
You can,
you can,

472
00:28:57.800 --> 00:29:02.720
I mean obviously up to kind of learn a little bit more about the technical part

473
00:29:02.721 --> 00:29:07.200
of it,
you know,
cause I make records and record,
but um,
but,

474
00:29:07.260 --> 00:29:10.520
but basically it's just like what you're used to and what you like.

475
00:29:10.550 --> 00:29:14.360
And that's the shame of it had a lot of people don't have never really

476
00:29:14.361 --> 00:29:17.180
experienced final.
And so,

477
00:29:17.181 --> 00:29:20.600
so they're fine with the little ear buds,
you know what I mean?

478
00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:25.580
Everything is squashed down to 16 bit and all that stuff.
And so it's,

479
00:29:25.610 --> 00:29:29.850
it sounds fine.
You know,
actually for classical music,
uh,

480
00:29:29.940 --> 00:29:34.850
cds worked pretty good because you could really start to pick out the different

481
00:29:34.851 --> 00:29:38.030
instruments,
you know?
But for rock and roll,
it just,

482
00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:42.250
were you just looking in a really like,
say an DC record,
you know,

483
00:29:42.251 --> 00:29:47.140
you're listening to two guitars and vocal and drums and,
and the singer and,
uh,

484
00:29:47.350 --> 00:29:52.120
you know,
there's so much space and air on a vinyl record,

485
00:29:52.121 --> 00:29:56.080
you know,
it's just amazing.
And then of course,
the old,

486
00:29:56.170 --> 00:29:58.900
old recordings are just brilliant.

487
00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:03.150
<v 2>When I was wrestling in high school,
we used to come out to lightening strikes.</v>

488
00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:09.630
<v 3>That's the one song that they,
that they did when I wasn't in the band.
Oh really?</v>

489
00:30:09.631 --> 00:30:11.970
I really liked and I,
and I keep saying,

490
00:30:12.180 --> 00:30:15.600
why don't we play what lightening strikes,
you know,
cause I,
it was really good,

491
00:30:15.601 --> 00:30:20.460
you know,
a good friend of ours wrote it.
And uh,
so,
you know,
I,
I don't care.

492
00:30:20.461 --> 00:30:24.510
I mean,
it's a,
it's a cool song,
you know,
and uh,
I dunno.

493
00:30:24.511 --> 00:30:26.280
It just kinda gets pushed to the side.

494
00:30:26.410 --> 00:30:29.410
<v 2>It's a great song.
That's cool.
Good for you though.
You don't,
it doesn't bother,</v>

495
00:30:29.430 --> 00:30:33.550
you know,
you guys had this separation period and then you came back.

496
00:30:33.551 --> 00:30:37.420
How much time did you separate for that wasn't gone about five years.

497
00:30:38.050 --> 00:30:42.100
What was it like to just not be in the band and then come back?

498
00:30:42.810 --> 00:30:46.180
<v 3>Well,
it was,
uh,
on the,
on the,</v>

499
00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:52.230
to get out there and play without any,
any hassle,
without any,
any,

500
00:30:53.430 --> 00:30:57.270
any like a backstage bullshit,
any of that crap,
you know,

501
00:30:57.271 --> 00:31:01.830
that was building up and then built up.
Um,
it was great.

502
00:31:01.860 --> 00:31:05.580
I just loved it because I could just get on stage play and I've had guys,

503
00:31:05.650 --> 00:31:07.140
it was more like a party.

504
00:31:07.141 --> 00:31:11.430
I just pick guys that can play and like the party and that's what we did.

505
00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:13.800
<v 2>So when you were doing the Joe Perry project,
you were,</v>

506
00:31:13.860 --> 00:31:18.450
you were essentially doing clubs and small theaters and just appreciating the

507
00:31:18.451 --> 00:31:19.284
music again.

508
00:31:19.450 --> 00:31:21.940
<v 3>Yeah.
And just getting out there and,
uh,</v>

509
00:31:22.270 --> 00:31:25.840
of course I was going through some personal stuff that was not so much fun,

510
00:31:25.841 --> 00:31:29.660
so kind of avoided Boston quite a bit.
But,
um,

511
00:31:30.130 --> 00:31:34.210
on the other hand I also had a young son that I was trying to see it at that

512
00:31:34.211 --> 00:31:36.820
time,
as,
as,
as I was going through the divorce.

513
00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:41.110
I also had my first son and uh,
you know,

514
00:31:41.111 --> 00:31:45.790
so I wanted to get back to see him.
But man,
I loved being on the road.
And,
uh,

515
00:31:45.810 --> 00:31:49.540
so it was a kind of a turbulent time,
but just strictly from the,

516
00:31:49.541 --> 00:31:51.880
from the playing part.
I loved it,

517
00:31:52.450 --> 00:31:56.710
but it was so good when you guys got back together again.
Well that was the,

518
00:31:57.490 --> 00:31:58.900
you know,
again,
Billy,

519
00:31:59.140 --> 00:32:03.900
my wife who I met when I was in a project really didn't know about Aerosmith.

520
00:32:03.910 --> 00:32:08.110
I'm,
she was traveling around the country and,
and kind of missed,

521
00:32:08.140 --> 00:32:12.220
missed the times we were there and just didn't listen to that kind of music.

522
00:32:12.220 --> 00:32:16.570
I mean,
was into,
you know,
like college radio and alternative music.

523
00:32:16.571 --> 00:32:20.080
And she didn't really know what an Aerosmith was.
And,
uh,
by,
you know,

524
00:32:20.081 --> 00:32:23.080
I didn't walk around with an Aerosmith tee shirt on and you know,
that Shit,

525
00:32:23.110 --> 00:32:26.590
you know,
she just remembers seeing me play and thinking,
oh,

526
00:32:26.591 --> 00:32:28.510
this guy might have some potential,
you know,

527
00:32:28.511 --> 00:32:31.990
somebody that somebody saw him and noticed them.
And in fact,

528
00:32:31.991 --> 00:32:35.350
she didn't even think the band I was with was,
it was my van.

529
00:32:35.351 --> 00:32:39.010
She thought it was the singer of the band,
you know,
but whatever.

530
00:32:39.050 --> 00:32:43.820
But the point is,
is,
is it coming from her,
her objective point of view,

531
00:32:43.850 --> 00:32:47.150
it was like,
cause I was thinking of joining up with some other guys,
like,

532
00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:50.570
like Alice,
Alice Cooper or something.
And she said,
well,

533
00:32:50.571 --> 00:32:54.280
if you're gonna play with play with that level people,
why don't,

534
00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:56.660
why don't you just go back with those guys?
You know?
I mean,

535
00:32:56.661 --> 00:33:01.490
you guys had a good time and obviously you did did well.

536
00:33:01.491 --> 00:33:06.470
So what's,
why not?
And it was like I sat down and I went,
well,
why not?

537
00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:10.680
You know,
the dust had settled,
a lot of personal stuff had been settled.
And,
uh,

538
00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:14.270
so I started talking with Steven and then the other guys,

539
00:33:14.271 --> 00:33:17.960
and over a couple of months we put it back together.

540
00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:20.390
<v 0>He guys came back with back in the saddle.</v>

541
00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:23.140
<v 3>Well,
well,
yeah.
Um,</v>

542
00:33:23.510 --> 00:33:26.920
<v 0>I mean that was a great fucking song.
We'll come back to,</v>

543
00:33:27.650 --> 00:33:31.280
<v 3>well,
we had the,
all those great songs from the 70s that,
that,
uh,</v>

544
00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:35.300
they still the backbone of,
of what we play today,
you know.
And uh,

545
00:33:35.690 --> 00:33:40.160
the first record with Geffin we did was not that hot,
I don't think.
I mean,

546
00:33:40.170 --> 00:33:44.150
we've hardcore fans,
you know,
some of them like it,
but,
uh,
you know,

547
00:33:44.151 --> 00:33:47.900
it w it obviously wasn't what we could do,
but by then we were still,

548
00:33:48.370 --> 00:33:51.350
we were still partying.
And it just wasn't working.

549
00:33:51.351 --> 00:33:54.920
So that's when we cleaned up and then we did for a minute vacation.

550
00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:59.020
<v 0>This gotta be a really difficult thing to manage when you're,
you're,</v>

551
00:33:59.090 --> 00:34:03.990
you're in a rock and roll band,
there's drugs,
there's partying,

552
00:34:03.991 --> 00:34:06.870
there's all this craziness with the Xos,
all lot of work that's gotta be done.

553
00:34:06.871 --> 00:34:11.700
Right.
There's a lot of writing and rehearsing and a lot of practicing and the

554
00:34:11.730 --> 00:34:13.080
managing,
all that stuff.

555
00:34:13.081 --> 00:34:17.070
And then managing all the Egos seems to me to be like probably one of the most

556
00:34:17.071 --> 00:34:20.850
difficult things about bands.
And it seems to be what always happens,

557
00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:24.060
the egos and then the drugs and then everything falls apart.

558
00:34:24.260 --> 00:34:28.410
<v 3>Yeah.
Well the drugs definitely exacerbate the whole,
the whole thing.
I mean,
what,</v>

559
00:34:28.411 --> 00:34:29.244
whatever.

560
00:34:29.330 --> 00:34:34.220
And in fact some of the most most fucked up stuff that happened to the band

561
00:34:34.340 --> 00:34:37.970
happened after we cleaned up,
you know?
And,
and again,

562
00:34:37.971 --> 00:34:42.080
that's kind of one of the reasons I wrote the book was because I felt like

563
00:34:42.650 --> 00:34:46.760
people should know just how hard it is or how it has been to keep the band

564
00:34:46.761 --> 00:34:50.570
together.
That's why there's so few of us that have,
that have managed to,
to,

565
00:34:51.230 --> 00:34:55.790
to be,
to make 40,
you know,
42 years now,
you know,

566
00:34:55.791 --> 00:35:00.560
and it's tough.
Um,
the behind the scenes stuff and uh,

567
00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:05.030
a lot of that just never came out,
uh,
especially the last 20 years.
So,

568
00:35:05.460 --> 00:35:09.410
um,
you know,
I felt like it should be documented somehow,
so.

569
00:35:09.700 --> 00:35:11.420
<v 0>Well,
the book is kicking ass,
man.
Uh,</v>

570
00:35:11.421 --> 00:35:13.870
I was at the bookstore the other day and it was number four in the New York

571
00:35:13.871 --> 00:35:18.290
Times bestseller list.
I mean,
that's gigantic.
They said,
yeah,

572
00:35:18.730 --> 00:35:21.610
you were number four on their little,
well,
you know,
the little shelf,

573
00:35:21.611 --> 00:35:24.820
whereas all the numbers let me know what number it was.
That's nice.
Well,

574
00:35:24.821 --> 00:35:27.370
you know,
it was a,
maybe an Aerosmith fence,
stuck it in there.

575
00:35:27.450 --> 00:35:29.700
Maybe it was number seven.
And he was like,
fuck was

576
00:35:29.770 --> 00:35:34.630
<v 3>came in at eight or something like that.
Uh,
when at first,
the first thing,
I mean,</v>

577
00:35:34.631 --> 00:35:38.720
we were just happy to make the top,
the top seller.
I mean,
whatever we did,

578
00:35:38.721 --> 00:35:39.554
we had no idea.

579
00:35:39.620 --> 00:35:44.300
<v 2>But look at that on Amazon,
four and a half stars.
Wow.
With 29 reviews.</v>

580
00:35:44.301 --> 00:35:47.740
That's gigantic.
That's pretty fucking huge.
Wow.
Well

581
00:35:47.910 --> 00:35:49.890
<v 3>still people with stenting and read it,
I guess.</v>

582
00:35:51.650 --> 00:35:53.570
<v 2>Well,
definitely the reading it,
it's it for,</v>

583
00:35:53.690 --> 00:35:56.390
for a lot of folks who grew up during that time,
you know,
uh,

584
00:35:56.391 --> 00:36:00.590
I was in high school in the 80s and you guys were just fucking super gigantic.

585
00:36:00.620 --> 00:36:04.910
It's a,
it's a part of our life,
you know?
I mean,
there's like,

586
00:36:04.940 --> 00:36:07.970
there's cultural icon bands.

587
00:36:07.971 --> 00:36:11.780
Van Halen was a cultural icon band for me.
Um,

588
00:36:12.080 --> 00:36:16.700
when David Lee Roth left van Halen,
I was depressed.
I was literally depressed.

589
00:36:17.030 --> 00:36:21.560
I couldn't believe it.
Uh,
you know,
I mean,
Sammy Hagar,
it seems like a great guy.

590
00:36:21.650 --> 00:36:25.940
He didn't nothing against Sammy Hagar,
but I was like,
what the fuck is this?
Like,

591
00:36:25.941 --> 00:36:29.030
what have you done?
Like,
what are you doing with my life?

592
00:36:30.350 --> 00:36:34.010
When I was a kid,
my friend Jay had on his car,

593
00:36:34.250 --> 00:36:38.150
John Rather his brother Jay,
my friend John,
the Jewett's,

594
00:36:38.180 --> 00:36:42.530
John Jay and his brother Cliffy and cliff.
He had a fucking 65 GTO.

595
00:36:42.530 --> 00:36:44.450
Is the sweetest card ever seen in my life.

596
00:36:44.660 --> 00:36:49.520
It was candy Apple Red 65 GTO that had chirps.
Chirps was his,
uh,

597
00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:53.510
his license plate because he would,
it was shift gears and make the tire squeal.

598
00:36:54.190 --> 00:36:58.610
He would do that all over the place.
But John had a van Halen license plate.

599
00:36:59.090 --> 00:37:02.630
It was like V,
you know,
abbreviated it in some fucking sort of way.

600
00:37:02.900 --> 00:37:04.120
But we were all,
we do the,

601
00:37:04.121 --> 00:37:08.210
like the Aerosmith logo on our notebooks and we do the van Halen logo.

602
00:37:08.211 --> 00:37:10.430
You remember that?
I do it.
Kiss logo,
my notebook.

603
00:37:10.850 --> 00:37:15.080
And then when fucking David Lee Roth left van Halen,
we were devastated.

604
00:37:15.290 --> 00:37:18.440
And it was the same thing when,
when you left Aerosmith,
everybody was like,

605
00:37:18.441 --> 00:37:23.360
what the fuck Aerosmith without Joe Perry?
What the fuck?

606
00:37:23.550 --> 00:37:27.240
<v 3>Yeah.
Well,
hey,
it was weird.
It was very weird.
I mean,</v>

607
00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:28.593
<v 2>that's depressing.</v>

608
00:37:29.670 --> 00:37:33.550
<v 3>Yeah.
I had to,
I had the bus loose.
I mean,
it was just too much.
I mean,</v>

609
00:37:33.551 --> 00:37:35.550
we literally walked off stage.

610
00:37:36.110 --> 00:37:38.720
I have to sell us to 60,000 people.

611
00:37:38.740 --> 00:37:43.360
And that was the last Gig I did with five years,
you know.
Um,

612
00:37:43.540 --> 00:37:45.550
but we stayed friends all through it.
I mean,

613
00:37:45.551 --> 00:37:50.230
we called each other and said hi,
you know,
and,
and that kind of thing.

614
00:37:50.231 --> 00:37:53.950
And it wasn't like we were like,
oh,
I'll never talk to that motherfucker again.

615
00:37:54.610 --> 00:37:57.610
Really wasn't like that.
I mean,
cause it was so much,

616
00:37:57.820 --> 00:38:00.280
so much stuff going on outside of the band.

617
00:38:00.610 --> 00:38:04.140
But I think that if the band had been,
and I've said this a million times,

618
00:38:04.150 --> 00:38:08.430
if we had been clearer,
we would have just taken a vacation and just kind of,

619
00:38:08.450 --> 00:38:13.210
you know,
relaxed.
So taking a couple of years and let things settle.

620
00:38:13.300 --> 00:38:14.170
You know what I mean?

621
00:38:14.440 --> 00:38:16.630
<v 2>Yeah.
I would think that when you're in a band,</v>

622
00:38:16.631 --> 00:38:19.570
it's that huge and worldwide and touring,

623
00:38:19.571 --> 00:38:23.620
just the sheer rpms that you're operating at.
Just a pain,

624
00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:29.640
just a touring and press and fucking crowds and Qigong and coke and booze and,

625
00:38:32.790 --> 00:38:36.130
ah,
ah,
ah,
he said it,
man.

626
00:38:36.130 --> 00:38:40.060
<v 0>I'll tell you part of the ringing in my ears from that,
just that.
Sure.</v>

627
00:38:40.061 --> 00:38:41.950
I'll tell you.
Do you have that tonight as shit?

628
00:38:42.050 --> 00:38:43.120
<v 3>No,
I don't.
I do.</v>

629
00:38:43.460 --> 00:38:47.510
I do have a little bit of a hearing loss and a couple of frequencies,
but,

630
00:38:47.640 --> 00:38:49.490
but I don't have the,
the tinnitus.

631
00:38:49.780 --> 00:38:52.690
<v 0>How did you avoid getting that?
Did you pull up with earplugs in?</v>

632
00:38:52.750 --> 00:38:53.583
<v 3>No,
I've been,</v>

633
00:38:53.660 --> 00:38:58.660
I've fortunately have really smaller ear canals and I don't have it.

634
00:38:59.890 --> 00:39:04.240
It's like I've been,
uh,
uh,
just really lucky and you know,

635
00:39:04.270 --> 00:39:08.110
I guess the,
if you get enough rest,
rest,

636
00:39:08.410 --> 00:39:11.410
rest your ears between,
between,
you know,

637
00:39:11.411 --> 00:39:15.520
the times it gets hit and also on stage,
it's not as loud as,

638
00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:18.990
it's not like I'm standing in front of the marshals all night long and you know

639
00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:23.710
what I mean?
And I'm moving around.
It gets loud.
It's not,
not as loud.
So,

640
00:39:24.040 --> 00:39:28.540
um,
I have to think it's that and just,
just good genes.

641
00:39:28.541 --> 00:39:33.370
I've been lucky,
you know,
and uh,
um,
I don't have that,

642
00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:35.830
that,
that constant ringing.
The guys get,

643
00:39:35.930 --> 00:39:38.340
<v 0>some guys are fucked.
It's really scary.</v>

644
00:39:38.341 --> 00:39:41.660
That worked for the bands like that would be backstage or fuck,

645
00:39:41.661 --> 00:39:44.570
like a lot of guys that work at venues,
he concert venues there.

646
00:39:44.571 --> 00:39:46.310
Fuck cause nobody knew back then.

647
00:39:46.730 --> 00:39:50.170
Nobody knew in the 70s and the eighties yad to keep your ear is clogged up or

648
00:39:50.210 --> 00:39:51.530
you'd be in trouble.
Yeah,

649
00:39:51.950 --> 00:39:55.400
<v 3>well it's,
they get all the charts now.
There's a,
you know,</v>

650
00:39:55.530 --> 00:40:00.260
like a half an hour if this db and a half an hour,
this db an hour,

651
00:40:00.350 --> 00:40:01.183
you know,
it was going to,

652
00:40:01.750 --> 00:40:04.790
there's a place where it actually starts causing permanent damage.

653
00:40:04.791 --> 00:40:08.810
So you can have the all,
they have it all charted out and we've gone,

654
00:40:09.140 --> 00:40:11.390
I've checked out the amps and see what,

655
00:40:11.840 --> 00:40:16.640
you know exactly how loud they are and all that and all that.
And so,
um,

656
00:40:17.030 --> 00:40:19.580
you know,
but uh,
but again,
we kind of a,

657
00:40:20.150 --> 00:40:24.880
I wonder around the stage a lot and there's a lot of times it isn't now in,
um,

658
00:40:25.910 --> 00:40:28.190
anyway,
I've just been fortunate not to have that.

659
00:40:28.570 --> 00:40:32.470
<v 0>Some bands,
they just really fucking crank it though.
Right.
Well,
you know,</v>

660
00:40:32.500 --> 00:40:37.060
it's more like a microphone closer to your face.
They do,

661
00:40:37.240 --> 00:40:38.220
you know what the guys,

662
00:40:38.250 --> 00:40:40.860
the drummers are the ones that get it the worst cause they,
you know,

663
00:40:41.270 --> 00:40:44.980
they're sitting right next to this snare drum and the symbols,
you know,

664
00:40:44.981 --> 00:40:47.440
and it's constant in there,
right,
right next to it.

665
00:40:47.441 --> 00:40:51.010
So they're the ones that are more liable to get it then than anybody.

666
00:40:51.070 --> 00:40:54.340
Do most guys now like plug their ears up where,
or some sort of

667
00:40:54.650 --> 00:40:59.510
<v 3>deduction?
You know,
I said,
I guess,
I don't know.
I mean,
uh,</v>

668
00:40:59.790 --> 00:41:03.770
uh,
a lot of them with the in ear monitors,
you know,

669
00:41:03.771 --> 00:41:06.920
especially with the seniors and that blocks a lot out.
But it also,

670
00:41:06.950 --> 00:41:10.400
it's really easy to turn those up too loud and that's,

671
00:41:10.490 --> 00:41:14.420
and that's constant as see,
that's,
that's where you can get in trouble,
you know,

672
00:41:14.421 --> 00:41:18.050
because you keep turning it up,
you get excited,
you here in the audience.

673
00:41:18.051 --> 00:41:22.730
And so it's a cause.
It's like,
you know,
constantly have a Nissan turned up.

674
00:41:22.760 --> 00:41:27.440
You know,
you don't have anything relative because you to get used to it and you,

675
00:41:27.500 --> 00:41:29.840
you're not feeling it.
So you turn it up a little more.

676
00:41:30.140 --> 00:41:34.760
So it's easy to get carried away with the,
with uh,
the ear things.
I mean,

677
00:41:34.761 --> 00:41:35.540
most of them have,

678
00:41:35.540 --> 00:41:40.010
have like a limiter on them so that they don't go over certain DB,

679
00:41:40.011 --> 00:41:42.920
but it's the constant thing that's more,
that's,

680
00:41:43.240 --> 00:41:47.500
it's more damaging then say like just getting hit like with,
uh,

681
00:41:47.810 --> 00:41:52.670
just one,
one zap of like 130 DB.
You know what I mean?

682
00:41:52.680 --> 00:41:55.590
<v 2>Me,
they say that about gunfire too.
Like if you,</v>

683
00:41:55.620 --> 00:41:58.410
if you hear one big boom,
you're okay.

684
00:41:58.620 --> 00:42:01.400
But if you hear a bunch of over and over where if you're at a range,
right?

685
00:42:01.750 --> 00:42:03.960
If you ever like you,
if you collect guns,

686
00:42:03.961 --> 00:42:07.530
do you ever use those electronic ones that muffle out the gunshot sounds but

687
00:42:07.531 --> 00:42:09.150
they actually amplify voices.

688
00:42:09.930 --> 00:42:14.040
I have somebody I've never gotten around to use them.
Other amazing try that.

689
00:42:14.041 --> 00:42:17.470
Right.
It's really interesting.
Weird.
Yeah,
it's crazy.
Like you,

690
00:42:17.471 --> 00:42:20.860
you can have a conversation,
you can hear like rappers,
right?
Like,

691
00:42:20.861 --> 00:42:22.530
like not rapper like a black guy.

692
00:42:22.740 --> 00:42:25.630
But I mean like a or a white guy wants to be a black guy.
I mean like,

693
00:42:25.750 --> 00:42:30.630
like a piece of paper.
Like you can hear like gum wrappers like really loud.

694
00:42:30.631 --> 00:42:33.270
It's like you hear things louder than you would normally,

695
00:42:33.420 --> 00:42:37.360
but then somehow or another when a gunshot goes off,
it muffles it.

696
00:42:37.570 --> 00:42:41.110
<v 3>Right.
I can see like hunting would be really good because then you can hear,</v>

697
00:42:41.111 --> 00:42:44.200
hear what's going on out there and uh,
but um,

698
00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:46.150
I just never had a chance to use them.

699
00:42:46.151 --> 00:42:50.730
I usually just put it in plugs and you know,
and that's when you go to,

700
00:42:50.731 --> 00:42:54.970
that's good enough.
Yeah.
Do you shoot a lot?
Collect all these couches?
I can,

701
00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:59.080
you know,
when I get home or when I'm up in the woods up in Vermont,
you know,

702
00:42:59.560 --> 00:43:03.610
<v 2>you know Anthony from opie and Anthony of course Anthony's.
It's fucking crazy.</v>

703
00:43:03.611 --> 00:43:07.450
He carries a gun with him everywhere.
He's got at least a hundred guns.

704
00:43:07.780 --> 00:43:10.810
Know he doesn't even know how many he has.
He's got it all over his house.
Yeah.

705
00:43:11.320 --> 00:43:15.700
<v 3>Hey,
we're in,
we're in the USA,
man.
We're,
we're in the privileged,</v>

706
00:43:15.820 --> 00:43:18.870
privileged country when it comes to that.
Yeah.
Well,

707
00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:23.140
you have a gun tattoo on your forearm.
What's that all about?
That I do,
um,

708
00:43:23.210 --> 00:43:25.960
says come and take it.
Oh,
whoa.

709
00:43:26.510 --> 00:43:30.430
And the Greek and Greek,
you know,
when,
what's his name?

710
00:43:31.350 --> 00:43:35.080
Leah.
And I just was at the,
at the thing there with the,

711
00:43:35.140 --> 00:43:39.750
with the Persians coming in and the Persian Guy said,
uh,
you know,

712
00:43:39.880 --> 00:43:44.350
throw down your spear and we'll let you go.
And he just said,
come and take it.

713
00:43:44.680 --> 00:43:46.510
And so that's the,
that's what that is.

714
00:43:46.710 --> 00:43:50.590
<v 2>That's American is fuck,
Hey,</v>

715
00:43:51.140 --> 00:43:53.160
I've gone to that too.
That says,
come and take it.

716
00:43:53.580 --> 00:43:55.320
It's about as American as you can get.

717
00:43:55.321 --> 00:43:58.180
Unless it was an eagle with a heart on hovering over the guy.

718
00:43:58.800 --> 00:44:00.870
That would be the only thing that will be more American

719
00:44:03.310 --> 00:44:07.610
constitution is deficit for a reasonable,
you know.
Well,
yeah,
it's,

720
00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:09.690
it's a hot topic for debate.

721
00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:14.190
It's one of those things where people will say some pretty ridiculous things.

722
00:44:15.360 --> 00:44:20.190
It's people hear something like this thing that happened in Seattle and a school

723
00:44:20.191 --> 00:44:24.660
shooting where this kid shot this girl that was apparently horrible,

724
00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:28.260
terrible.
But that's a mental illness issue to me.

725
00:44:28.350 --> 00:44:33.350
The fact that he had a gun is just the tool that he used to carry out his

726
00:44:34.050 --> 00:44:37.160
mentally ill idea.
It's,

727
00:44:37.590 --> 00:44:41.670
it has almost nothing to do with it.
I mean obviously gone makes it easier,

728
00:44:41.671 --> 00:44:45.780
but we have millions of guns in this country.
Millions.

729
00:44:45.990 --> 00:44:49.560
And if you look at the amount of actual violence that takes place,

730
00:44:50.070 --> 00:44:53.910
is it regrettable that it happens because you know,
be someone uses a gum that,

731
00:44:53.911 --> 00:44:54.151
Yap.

732
00:44:54.151 --> 00:44:59.151
So apps a Fuckin lutely but there's so many factors that lead to someone doing

733
00:44:59.581 --> 00:45:02.340
something horrible.
The tool that they use.

734
00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:06.840
It shouldn't be that you're going to take those tools away from everybody who

735
00:45:06.841 --> 00:45:10.170
would never do that in a million years.
That seems ridiculous to me.

736
00:45:10.440 --> 00:45:12.630
It just doesn't,
it doesn't seem logical.

737
00:45:12.660 --> 00:45:15.960
We don't live in a perfect world where everything is black and white and easy to

738
00:45:15.961 --> 00:45:16.794
solve.

739
00:45:16.850 --> 00:45:20.070
<v 3>Exactly.
It's,
it's,
it's,
so,
you know,</v>

740
00:45:20.100 --> 00:45:24.890
and I have issues with certain things about like say the what the NRA says.

741
00:45:24.891 --> 00:45:29.600
You know what I mean?
It's like there.
I mean,
I think that a lot,
I mean,

742
00:45:29.601 --> 00:45:33.080
we have have some laws that should be enforced,
you know,

743
00:45:33.500 --> 00:45:37.010
more stringently and,
and I think that it should be more standardized.
I mean,

744
00:45:37.011 --> 00:45:40.040
it's crazy that you can,
they can have a carry a gun in one state,

745
00:45:40.340 --> 00:45:44.270
then you cross the border and you're totally,
and you're a felon,
you know,

746
00:45:44.271 --> 00:45:46.580
it's just,
it should be standardized,
you know,

747
00:45:46.880 --> 00:45:49.280
and they should have background checks that the,

748
00:45:49.281 --> 00:45:53.240
that they do should be more stringent and all that.
But you know,
uh,

749
00:45:53.420 --> 00:45:56.300
to say that we're going to just snap your fingers and everything's going to be

750
00:45:56.301 --> 00:46:00.890
nice if we just ban guns.
I mean,
I was in Australia a couple of,

751
00:46:00.950 --> 00:46:05.900
a couple of trips ago and I remember there was a sky that was walking around the

752
00:46:05.901 --> 00:46:07.940
streets carrying an ax.

753
00:46:08.450 --> 00:46:13.450
And when apparently he hadn't done anything violent,

754
00:46:14.241 --> 00:46:18.830
but just the fact that he was like,
obviously not right.
You know,

755
00:46:18.831 --> 00:46:21.170
when people saw him and they looked out of me and,
and you know,

756
00:46:21.171 --> 00:46:24.710
it was living in a different world,
let's say,
and not,

757
00:46:24.720 --> 00:46:26.780
it was just carrying this acts around,
you know,

758
00:46:26.781 --> 00:46:30.800
walking down the street downtown and you know,
I mean,

759
00:46:31.070 --> 00:46:34.220
who knew when the guy's gonna turn around and swing it?
You know?

760
00:46:34.260 --> 00:46:38.120
And so it's like you said,
it's like,
it's,
it's really not the tool.
It's,

761
00:46:38.121 --> 00:46:41.500
it's the guy wielding it.
And that's the,

762
00:46:41.840 --> 00:46:46.340
that's a big part of the issue.
And the fact is that this country was,

763
00:46:47.840 --> 00:46:51.770
I mean,
it's such a part of our culture.
I mean,
there isn't it,
I mean,

764
00:46:51.771 --> 00:46:55.100
how many statues are there with guys stand and they will the flintlock in their

765
00:46:55.101 --> 00:46:56.240
heads.
You know what I mean?

766
00:46:56.880 --> 00:47:00.900
<v 2>It is definitely a part of how the people that originally found this country</v>

767
00:47:00.901 --> 00:47:05.850
liberated themselves from these kings and queens and the,
the,

768
00:47:05.851 --> 00:47:08.520
the,
the monarchies that we're in control of,
uh,

769
00:47:08.730 --> 00:47:11.490
the population Europe and the reason why they came to America in the first
place.

770
00:47:12.060 --> 00:47:14.430
But,
so it's slavery.
It's like,

771
00:47:14.431 --> 00:47:17.940
it's one of those things like that's a part of our foundation of our country.

772
00:47:18.270 --> 00:47:19.980
And so as black people in shackles,

773
00:47:19.981 --> 00:47:22.380
so it's not really exactly something to be excited about.

774
00:47:23.190 --> 00:47:27.420
I think that there's not enough laws when it comes to,
um,

775
00:47:27.540 --> 00:47:31.960
making it difficult to a gun.
I think that you should have to take a test,

776
00:47:32.140 --> 00:47:33.460
you should have to know what you're doing.

777
00:47:33.640 --> 00:47:37.150
I think it's absolutely ridiculous that all you have to do is have a background

778
00:47:37.151 --> 00:47:40.210
check.
And if you're not a crazy person or you haven't been in jail,

779
00:47:40.390 --> 00:47:41.223
you can get a gun.

780
00:47:41.410 --> 00:47:45.070
But you gotta you gotta go through a bunch of fucking hoops and ladders to get a

781
00:47:45.071 --> 00:47:46.270
driver's license.
Right?

782
00:47:46.271 --> 00:47:51.271
Like how do you not have to have a really detailed understanding of how to be

783
00:47:52.931 --> 00:47:56.880
safe with a firearm?
What's the correct use of a firearm?
What are the laws of,
of,

784
00:47:56.881 --> 00:47:58.210
of,
of using a firearm,

785
00:47:58.390 --> 00:48:02.470
what are the laws and as far as state by state and how you protect yourself.

786
00:48:02.471 --> 00:48:04.380
You know,
everyone now is aware,

787
00:48:04.390 --> 00:48:08.650
the Florida's got some fucking wacky laws cause the Zimmerman case and you know,

788
00:48:08.651 --> 00:48:12.400
there's other states that are even more loose than Florida is when it comes to

789
00:48:12.401 --> 00:48:15.520
what you can do in fucking Arizona.
You could just walk around with a gun.

790
00:48:15.610 --> 00:48:17.790
<v 3>All right.
I mean they,
they have open carry the,
yeah.</v>

791
00:48:17.980 --> 00:48:21.490
But then you also look at the,
uh,
crime rate.

792
00:48:21.491 --> 00:48:23.560
And in most states that have have,

793
00:48:24.250 --> 00:48:26.830
you're allowed to have a gun in some form or another,

794
00:48:27.250 --> 00:48:31.410
most of the crime rates are lower,
but then,
then,
you know,
there's,

795
00:48:31.480 --> 00:48:35.470
there's ways they can skew the,
the,
the numbers,
the numbers and,
and,
you know,

796
00:48:35.471 --> 00:48:38.680
make it look better for one than the other.

797
00:48:38.681 --> 00:48:41.950
And in a lot of other things have to be taken into account,
but,

798
00:48:42.370 --> 00:48:47.370
but overall that the states that have guns have a lower a lower crime rate.

799
00:48:48.791 --> 00:48:52.020
But,
you know,
um,
again,
there has,

800
00:48:52.060 --> 00:48:56.980
there are other factors involved.
But,
um,
I think that people should,
uh,

801
00:48:57.010 --> 00:49:01.750
it should be more standardized and it should be treated with more respect.

802
00:49:01.751 --> 00:49:06.430
But I don't think that at this point anybody's going to be taking the,
again,

803
00:49:06.850 --> 00:49:09.860
they take away the guns.
The criminals will have guns,
you know,

804
00:49:10.680 --> 00:49:14.470
letting them go cause they made illegal,
it's like,
come on,
you use this too late.

805
00:49:15.100 --> 00:49:18.040
It's like trying to take salt out of the ocean.
Like good luck.

806
00:49:19.130 --> 00:49:20.170
That's ridiculous.

807
00:49:20.560 --> 00:49:25.500
<v 2>So it's too much.
And it's also my,
my feeling on it is like,</v>

808
00:49:25.501 --> 00:49:28.860
okay,
well who's going to get to decide?
Is it going to be the federal government?

809
00:49:29.070 --> 00:49:31.830
Well,
what a wonderful job they've done of regulating marijuana.

810
00:49:32.070 --> 00:49:34.470
Fucking locking little kids up in jail.
I mean there's,

811
00:49:34.471 --> 00:49:37.740
there's people that are in jail for the rest of their life for marijuana and you

812
00:49:37.741 --> 00:49:42.190
want me to trust the same people to regulate firearms,
fuck off.
You know,
they,

813
00:49:42.191 --> 00:49:45.450
they've done a terrible job and what they've done with our tax dollars have done

814
00:49:45.451 --> 00:49:49.890
a terrible job with how they've mitigated natural disasters like Katrina and

815
00:49:49.891 --> 00:49:51.900
diseases and what they're doing with Ebola.

816
00:49:52.110 --> 00:49:53.730
They've done a shit job across the board.

817
00:49:53.850 --> 00:49:58.110
So the idea that we're going to let the federal government or I'll allow these

818
00:49:58.111 --> 00:50:01.410
people that are in control of the federal government,
I should say,

819
00:50:01.530 --> 00:50:03.690
cause you know,
what is the federal government,
you know,
it's,

820
00:50:03.730 --> 00:50:07.800
it's a group that's supposed to keep everybody safe and an order in this whole

821
00:50:07.801 --> 00:50:09.540
country,
but they're just a bunch of fucking assholes.

822
00:50:09.540 --> 00:50:14.040
They get elected for jobs or get hired for jobs and try to make their jobs as

823
00:50:14.041 --> 00:50:18.000
easy as possible.
Running things did,
this doesn't make any sense to me.

824
00:50:18.120 --> 00:50:21.360
That's why I think something like the NRA is actually important.

825
00:50:21.600 --> 00:50:23.880
You need a counterbalance to the,
the,

826
00:50:23.881 --> 00:50:27.290
the wackiness of the knee jerk reactionary people that just want to pull things

827
00:50:27.291 --> 00:50:30.170
away,
right?
We need to keep all the guns away from people.

828
00:50:30.320 --> 00:50:31.640
You're not going to do that.

829
00:50:31.670 --> 00:50:36.670
You need to accept the fact that there's a fucking 700 million gun collection in

830
00:50:36.741 --> 00:50:38.660
this country.
I mean,
who knows how many guns there are.

831
00:50:39.630 --> 00:50:40.280
<v 3>I Dunno.</v>

832
00:50:40.280 --> 00:50:43.960
<v 2>It's probably more guns than people.
Fuck of a lot.
Fuck of a lot.
That's it.
Right?</v>

833
00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:44.950
That's the exact right amount.

834
00:50:45.040 --> 00:50:49.310
<v 3>The other thing is it's like again,
who,
I mean just because you have one,</v>

835
00:50:49.320 --> 00:50:52.110
it doesn't mean you safe that you exactly know it's been,

836
00:50:52.380 --> 00:50:55.780
I think Hemingway said it's probably the for like a,

837
00:50:56.350 --> 00:51:00.390
a small weapon.
Pr is probably the more,

838
00:51:00.420 --> 00:51:04.770
more bullets have been fired and mist than any other weapon in history.

839
00:51:05.180 --> 00:51:07.740
And it was something to Hemingway said,
but uh,

840
00:51:07.800 --> 00:51:11.160
I mean frankly I'd be more afraid of you with your bare hands,

841
00:51:11.520 --> 00:51:15.600
with the training you've had than say somebody that comes bursting in with a,

842
00:51:15.630 --> 00:51:19.910
with a gun waving a gun around.
You know what I mean?
Because you've,

843
00:51:20.400 --> 00:51:22.440
it's training.
It's,
it's like the whole thing.

844
00:51:22.441 --> 00:51:26.580
I mean guys that are trained and trained and trained and one,
all these,
you know,

845
00:51:26.940 --> 00:51:31.940
sharp shooting stuff and it's like they get an altercation in the line of duty

846
00:51:32.551 --> 00:51:37.050
and they fire 40 rounds and they miss.
Everyone did definitely panic.

847
00:51:37.080 --> 00:51:40.140
So sure.
It's definitely not a,
you know,

848
00:51:41.430 --> 00:51:43.800
I think that they just need to tighten up the laws.

849
00:51:43.890 --> 00:51:46.980
<v 2>Well.
Also we know people.
This one,
one of the arguments people say,</v>

850
00:51:46.981 --> 00:51:48.330
well the the laws,

851
00:51:48.360 --> 00:51:52.410
the second amendment was written back when they had muskets and today you have

852
00:51:52.411 --> 00:51:54.960
ar 15 is you have semiautomatic rifles,

853
00:51:54.961 --> 00:51:59.160
you have all these crazy guns that are super accurate and long range scopes.

854
00:51:59.580 --> 00:52:00.690
This is absolutely true,

855
00:52:00.691 --> 00:52:04.650
but one thing that people need to take into consideration is that there's also a

856
00:52:04.651 --> 00:52:06.060
thing called drones.

857
00:52:06.300 --> 00:52:11.300
And what we have now is nothing in comparison to the reality of warfare in other

858
00:52:12.271 --> 00:52:13.230
countries.
Like what we're,

859
00:52:13.290 --> 00:52:16.500
what we're doing right now in other countries with drones when they're firing

860
00:52:16.501 --> 00:52:19.410
missiles from flying robots right now,

861
00:52:19.470 --> 00:52:21.480
those are only in the hands of the military.

862
00:52:21.810 --> 00:52:25.380
Who's to say that that's how it's going to be 50 years from now?

863
00:52:25.500 --> 00:52:27.570
Who's to say that's how it's going to be 30 years from now?

864
00:52:27.810 --> 00:52:31.740
There's gonna come a time where we're going to have to trust that people don't

865
00:52:31.741 --> 00:52:34.890
just send a drone over to your house and eliminate your fucking building.

866
00:52:35.290 --> 00:52:38.880
And that sounds preposterous,
but it's not they,
it's not.
They do.

867
00:52:38.881 --> 00:52:39.990
It all can happen.

868
00:52:40.390 --> 00:52:41.470
<v 3>Yeah.
I mean,
it's like</v>

869
00:52:41.620 --> 00:52:42.640
<v 2>not just the government,</v>

870
00:52:42.641 --> 00:52:46.390
but regular people are going to have access to that technology.

871
00:52:46.650 --> 00:52:51.510
<v 3>It's right.
It's just go online and you can,
you can buy the drones now.</v>

872
00:52:51.740 --> 00:52:55.110
These Helen's,
he's that can lift a couple of pounds.
Yeah.
Who knows what the,

873
00:52:55.140 --> 00:52:59.490
what the hell?
I mean,
so it's again,
it's like people behind the stuff,
you know,

874
00:52:59.520 --> 00:53:03.560
the carry this stuff.
It's,
so,
anyway,
that's a

875
00:53:03.870 --> 00:53:06.130
<v 2>going to have to address mental illness in this country.
I mean that's,</v>

876
00:53:06.150 --> 00:53:10.070
that's a giant issue and I don't think pharmaceutical drug companies want us to

877
00:53:10.071 --> 00:53:13.820
do that for sure.
Because they're making unbelievable amounts of money,

878
00:53:13.821 --> 00:53:17.810
just medicating people to sending pills into people's lives.

879
00:53:18.320 --> 00:53:20.600
And some of it is helping people.
Again,

880
00:53:20.601 --> 00:53:22.160
that's not a black and white issue either.

881
00:53:22.161 --> 00:53:26.340
There's a lot of people that take antidepressants and psychotic medication is

882
00:53:26.341 --> 00:53:28.920
doing a world of good for them.
I know personally,

883
00:53:28.921 --> 00:53:31.470
people whose lives have benefited tremendously.

884
00:53:31.471 --> 00:53:33.960
I have friends that were on the verge of suicide,
right.

885
00:53:33.961 --> 00:53:36.510
And they started taking antidepressants and SSRS,

886
00:53:36.511 --> 00:53:40.560
and now they're happy and healthy and they're doing great and I'm so happy that

887
00:53:40.561 --> 00:53:44.100
they exist for that reason.
But again,

888
00:53:44.101 --> 00:53:46.710
this isn't a black white issue because if you look at school shootings and you

889
00:53:46.711 --> 00:53:49.980
look at these mass shootings and you look at the amount of those people that are

890
00:53:49.981 --> 00:53:54.150
on anti psychotic or ssrs and all these different medications,

891
00:53:54.510 --> 00:53:56.910
it's all,
it's almost like 90 something percent.

892
00:53:56.910 --> 00:53:58.530
It's incredible how many people are on it.

893
00:53:58.830 --> 00:54:02.700
So you have to wonder how much of what's happening with these school shootings

894
00:54:02.730 --> 00:54:07.110
in these different mass killings.
Is this associated with powers of these drugs?

895
00:54:07.290 --> 00:54:10.650
The fact that these people can detach themselves from these crimes,

896
00:54:10.760 --> 00:54:14.550
the detach themselves from violent acts,
we,
we,
you know,
we don't know.

897
00:54:14.551 --> 00:54:17.880
We don't know exactly what we're doing.
We're dabbling with the human mind,

898
00:54:18.060 --> 00:54:22.560
especially when we're dealing with truly troubled people that maybe didn't

899
00:54:22.561 --> 00:54:26.610
develop properly when they were children in the mechanism for understanding and

900
00:54:26.611 --> 00:54:29.670
compassion just isn't.
There,
just isn't there.

901
00:54:29.820 --> 00:54:32.040
And you're dealing with people who were abused.

902
00:54:32.160 --> 00:54:35.550
You're dealing with people who are isolated and bullied and then you're giving

903
00:54:35.551 --> 00:54:39.660
them these disassociative drugs and you're giving them access to guns and Whoa,

904
00:54:39.690 --> 00:54:43.680
you got a fucking huge problem and then America will go,
which a gun problem,

905
00:54:43.740 --> 00:54:45.470
the fuck it's a gun problem,
right.

906
00:54:45.650 --> 00:54:50.510
<v 3>It's not a gun problem.
I totally agree.
Totally.
I mean that's,
that's it.</v>

907
00:54:50.660 --> 00:54:54.920
That's the problem is,
is they,
they don't take the medication is what the,

908
00:54:54.980 --> 00:54:59.240
you know,
my experience has been,
we'll like when we've had people you know,

909
00:54:59.300 --> 00:55:02.180
that have found out where we live so to speak,

910
00:55:03.420 --> 00:55:06.070
they've gone off their medication,
you know what I mean?
And the,

911
00:55:06.080 --> 00:55:08.990
and then they're like,
uh,
reading anyway.

912
00:55:08.991 --> 00:55:12.210
I don't want to know you get do that anymore.
You know what I mean?
Yes.

913
00:55:12.440 --> 00:55:15.710
We have a good buddy that had a,
he,
ah,
he's a great guy,

914
00:55:15.770 --> 00:55:19.250
<v 2>but he got off his medication and went wonky and I started getting emails from</v>

915
00:55:19.251 --> 00:55:23.410
people,
Hey,
our friend is having an issue here.
He's off his medication.

916
00:55:23.411 --> 00:55:26.360
When would figure out a way to get him and get him back on his medication.

917
00:55:26.570 --> 00:55:28.730
And when he was off his medication,
he was just gone though.

918
00:55:28.790 --> 00:55:32.680
<v 3>It was just,
it wasn't the same guy.
Right.
But when he was on it,
great guy.</v>

919
00:55:32.750 --> 00:55:35.740
It's like you said,
it's so,
it has its place.
It's just,

920
00:55:35.900 --> 00:55:37.420
it gets overused and you know,

921
00:55:37.421 --> 00:55:41.170
the drug companies going around and they just handed the stuff out for free to

922
00:55:41.171 --> 00:55:45.550
the doctors and the doctors.
Fine.
You know,
that's the,

923
00:55:45.551 --> 00:55:48.970
that's the new cut.
The new disease does your,
that's on the cover of time,

924
00:55:49.300 --> 00:55:53.770
you know,
so let's it ask your doctor what this can do for you.
Oh Man.

925
00:55:53.830 --> 00:55:58.510
Ask Your doctor,
ask your doctor,
you know,
and then too much,
you know,

926
00:55:58.770 --> 00:56:03.560
will cause a heart attack.
You may drop dead.
You may be violent diarrhea,
right.

927
00:56:03.690 --> 00:56:04.600
Suicidal thoughts.

928
00:56:04.601 --> 00:56:08.260
That's my favorite suicidal thoughts for antidepressants cause suicidal
thoughts,

929
00:56:08.640 --> 00:56:11.860
bleeding,
bleeding from your ears.
I mean all that stuff.

930
00:56:11.861 --> 00:56:13.720
And it's like in the fine print,
you know,

931
00:56:14.620 --> 00:56:18.580
<v 2>again,
it's the issue that it's,
these are,
everybody wants to have like,</v>

932
00:56:18.581 --> 00:56:22.360
we need to do this.
We know we need to examine this issue.

933
00:56:22.540 --> 00:56:26.840
There's not clear cut situation.
It's not a black or white situation.
Right.

934
00:56:26.850 --> 00:56:28.930
It's this very bizarre,
nuanced,

935
00:56:28.931 --> 00:56:33.610
complex issue that we only deal with when the fucking thing explodes.

936
00:56:33.670 --> 00:56:36.250
We only deal with it when someone walks in with school and start shooting

937
00:56:36.251 --> 00:56:38.920
everybody up by Columbine and then we start dealing with it.

938
00:56:39.190 --> 00:56:42.820
But when that's not happening,
we don't,
we don't address it.

939
00:56:42.821 --> 00:56:46.330
We move on with our lives cause we have mortgages and student loans and fucking

940
00:56:46.331 --> 00:56:51.070
traffic and our kids are screaming and you just,
it's,
it's easy to forget.

941
00:56:51.100 --> 00:56:55.030
It's easy to forget that we live in this incredibly medicated society and it

942
00:56:55.031 --> 00:56:55.864
doesn't always work.

943
00:56:56.220 --> 00:57:00.910
<v 3>And it's tough.
I mean,
the,
the,
the way that they read them,
the mainstream press,</v>

944
00:57:00.911 --> 00:57:04.810
and they say the economy's doing better,
economy is not doing better.
I mean,

945
00:57:04.811 --> 00:57:09.640
it's tough out there,
you know?
And so people award for about day to day stuff.

946
00:57:09.650 --> 00:57:13.630
I mean,
they're living in,
it's like a,
it's really easy to not worry about,

947
00:57:13.660 --> 00:57:18.310
you know,
what happened in some state and wherever and,
you know,
so it's,

948
00:57:18.340 --> 00:57:21.800
it's,
it's,
it's really tough,
you know,
uh,
to,

949
00:57:21.840 --> 00:57:26.170
to focus on some of those things and,
and,
and do something about it,
you know?

950
00:57:26.310 --> 00:57:29.640
<v 2>Yeah.
I don't understand the economy.
Do you understand the economy?</v>

951
00:57:29.700 --> 00:57:33.190
<v 3>Not at all.
I mean,
just the people there.
Well,
I do,</v>

952
00:57:33.220 --> 00:57:37.700
I do understand that too many,
too many jobs are outsourced.
You know what I mean?

953
00:57:37.701 --> 00:57:41.100
And,
and I saw it happened in my hometown,
you know,

954
00:57:41.101 --> 00:57:45.270
and it was like self contained place.
Everybody worked there.

955
00:57:45.480 --> 00:57:50.200
They made every part that they needed in that factory.
And it turned out,
uh,

956
00:57:50.510 --> 00:57:53.530
you know,
these,
these complicated machines,
every,

957
00:57:53.540 --> 00:57:56.740
it got bought up by a big company and then they started taking the,

958
00:57:57.030 --> 00:58:00.840
the place apart.
People started losing their jobs.
And it's,

959
00:58:00.980 --> 00:58:04.860
the town basically is just a bedroom community now for,
uh,
you know,

960
00:58:05.070 --> 00:58:08.070
for a commute to Boston or wherever they can find a job.

961
00:58:08.390 --> 00:58:10.380
<v 2>Well,
Detroit,
which you brought up earlier.
Yeah.</v>

962
00:58:10.460 --> 00:58:13.280
We filmed the television show in Detroit and man,

963
00:58:13.730 --> 00:58:16.730
I couldn't believe the amount of poverty that I was seeing in there.

964
00:58:16.731 --> 00:58:20.720
I mean people always talk about third world countries and how horrible third

965
00:58:20.721 --> 00:58:21.880
world countries are.
D,

966
00:58:22.100 --> 00:58:25.580
there's areas of Detroit that you'd be better off in third world country,

967
00:58:25.640 --> 00:58:28.490
you know,
at least in third world country,
maybe you could live off the land.

968
00:58:28.760 --> 00:58:33.080
I mean you're,
you're in an urban environment where these poor fucking people,

969
00:58:33.081 --> 00:58:35.330
man.
There were some people that why was there,
they were,

970
00:58:35.540 --> 00:58:38.270
they were fishing in this river that was a,
one of,

971
00:58:38.300 --> 00:58:42.590
it's voted more rated as one of the most polluted rivers in the country.

972
00:58:42.860 --> 00:58:45.620
And these people were pulling out fish to eat cause they were starving.

973
00:58:45.680 --> 00:58:48.290
I mean they were just hungry and there was not one,

974
00:58:48.350 --> 00:58:50.540
there was a bunch of poor people.

975
00:58:50.690 --> 00:58:54.020
They were fishing in this river and pulling these fish out and you know,

976
00:58:54.080 --> 00:58:58.790
it smelled,
it was next to a factory,
had fucking stunk.
It was next to Zug island.

977
00:58:58.940 --> 00:59:02.000
And there's all this,
this shit in the water.
You looking at those,
you know,

978
00:59:02.001 --> 00:59:06.350
that rainbow sort of Shane that gets on the water when oil and gas,

979
00:59:06.380 --> 00:59:10.050
you know that nasty shit.
Yeah.
It was the t shirt on site.

980
00:59:10.080 --> 00:59:14.870
Was it the dump I used to play play in what are the EBT?
What's EBT?

981
00:59:15.380 --> 00:59:19.820
It's not bet.
Nah,
it's a,
it's a like a parody.
Yeah.
That's all I'm telling you.

982
00:59:22.310 --> 00:59:27.200
But yeah,
there's these,
I mean,
did you ever see Roger and me,
the documentary,

983
00:59:27.201 --> 00:59:30.290
Michael Moore About Flint,
Michigan?
No,
I don't know.

984
00:59:30.470 --> 00:59:33.320
It's about them closing an auto pen or a plant in Flint,
Michigan.

985
00:59:33.321 --> 00:59:37.610
And now these poor folks who their entire livelihood was based on this auto

986
00:59:37.640 --> 00:59:42.370
plant and this,
this,
this business and it just went away.
And then the,

987
00:59:42.371 --> 00:59:46.490
the entire town just fell apart.
And it's where Michael Maura grew up.

988
00:59:46.491 --> 00:59:51.290
So he sort of documented this whole tragedy unfolding.

989
00:59:51.291 --> 00:59:54.620
It's unbelievably depressing because they're trapped.

990
00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:59.020
<v 3>Yeah.
I mean,
they're in a place that's,
unless they have that,</v>

991
00:59:59.200 --> 01:00:02.590
that factory that there's,
there's,
you know,

992
01:00:02.591 --> 01:00:06.670
like it's a long drive to some place,
any place,
you know,
you could find work.

993
01:00:07.060 --> 01:00:11.380
And it's like,
it's exactly what I'm talking about where I grew up,
you know,

994
01:00:11.381 --> 01:00:14.240
same thing.
So you know,
my uh,
you know,

995
01:00:14.260 --> 01:00:16.510
my background is unlike a lot,

996
01:00:16.511 --> 01:00:20.890
a lot of people and I think that's the core of what the economy is.
I mean,

997
01:00:20.891 --> 01:00:25.270
when we were at the strongest,
we're making everything here,
you know,

998
01:00:25.510 --> 01:00:28.480
and uh,
and it just killed me.
I remember lifting,

999
01:00:28.510 --> 01:00:31.310
lifting some weights somewhere and,
and I'm looking at this,

1000
01:00:31.390 --> 01:00:35.140
this 50 pound weight and this is made in China and the telling me that it's

1001
01:00:35.141 --> 01:00:40.000
cheaper to make it in China and ship it all the way over here than it is to make

1002
01:00:40.001 --> 01:00:44.590
it here and that crazy.
Is that possible?
How is that possible?
It's like,
you know,

1003
01:00:44.591 --> 01:00:47.050
and this was 15,
20 years ago,
you know,

1004
01:00:47.051 --> 01:00:51.580
when I was going to the gym a lot and checking it out and it was like all this

1005
01:00:51.581 --> 01:00:54.610
stuff has made,
made overseas and how can they,

1006
01:00:54.970 --> 01:00:59.290
how can they be better for the economy for it to be made over there and which is

1007
01:00:59.291 --> 01:01:01.070
talking about dead weight,
you know?

1008
01:01:01.700 --> 01:01:01.911
<v 2>Well,</v>

1009
01:01:01.911 --> 01:01:06.620
there was also a bunch of times when things got made overseas and they were way

1010
01:01:06.621 --> 01:01:07.720
better too.
That's a,

1011
01:01:07.740 --> 01:01:12.680
that's a real issue like made in China was always like a dis,

1012
01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:15.380
you know,
like,
oh,
it's made in China.
Like there was always like,

1013
01:01:15.410 --> 01:01:17.630
because it means that it was made as cheap as possible.

1014
01:01:17.631 --> 01:01:21.740
But when I was growing up it was Japan.
Yeah.
Iphones,
iPhones are all made.

1015
01:01:21.741 --> 01:01:24.890
They're made in a factory where people are jumping off the God damn roof,
man.

1016
01:01:25.400 --> 01:01:25.910
I mean,

1017
01:01:25.910 --> 01:01:30.150
they have nets all around the Foxconn factories because so many people who work

1018
01:01:30.151 --> 01:01:31.730
there are jumping off the roof.

1019
01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:34.940
They live there and they worked the haven't seen this.
No.
Oh,
it's horrible.

1020
01:01:35.150 --> 01:01:39.170
Foxconn had,
and this is the cute thing,
is the way they dress it up,

1021
01:01:39.290 --> 01:01:40.460
what they say is,
well,

1022
01:01:40.610 --> 01:01:44.210
the percentage of people that commit suicide of these factories is pretty much

1023
01:01:44.211 --> 01:01:47.120
the same as a percentage of people that commit suicide in the country.

1024
01:01:47.330 --> 01:01:50.030
But what they don't tell you is how many of those fucking people commit suicide

1025
01:01:50.031 --> 01:01:54.110
at work?
Unbelieved they live there.
So they're slaves.

1026
01:01:54.170 --> 01:01:57.620
They're essentially slaves.
They're making pennies an hour.
I mean,

1027
01:01:57.621 --> 01:01:59.530
I dunno what the exact number is,
but it's,

1028
01:01:59.540 --> 01:02:03.140
it's not a living wage in this country by any stretch of the imagination.

1029
01:02:03.530 --> 01:02:07.280
And these people are so fucking depressed and so overworked that they have to

1030
01:02:07.281 --> 01:02:10.280
put nets all around the buildings,
keep them from jumping off the roof.

1031
01:02:10.550 --> 01:02:14.900
And that's how you get an iPhone four,
you know,
x 99 instead of,
you know,

1032
01:02:14.901 --> 01:02:16.790
something more expensive.
It's crazy.

1033
01:02:16.910 --> 01:02:21.660
<v 3>Unbelievable.
No,
I haven't seen one that was,
uh,
that one's new.</v>

1034
01:02:21.720 --> 01:02:25.950
I mean,
now,
and we've been watching the,
the bowl of thing and,
uh,

1035
01:02:26.320 --> 01:02:27.900
don't you know that how,

1036
01:02:28.320 --> 01:02:32.520
how that has been like mismanaged from the start.
I mean,

1037
01:02:32.910 --> 01:02:37.650
when at first when we were first reading about it on the UN,
like when you,

1038
01:02:37.680 --> 01:02:42.170
you,
you guys are talking about,
you know,
Alex Jones,
all the,
this stuff under,

1039
01:02:42.270 --> 01:02:46.850
you know,
the,
the,
the news from all around,
you know,
that they,
that they,
uh,

1040
01:02:46.890 --> 01:02:50.190
you know,
you,
it's really easy to find on the,
on the Internet.

1041
01:02:50.191 --> 01:02:54.920
And I was in New York for,
we were there doing some stuff for the book.
And,

1042
01:02:54.921 --> 01:02:55.790
and,
um,

1043
01:02:56.280 --> 01:03:00.510
for a week I was reading the New York Times and USA Today and they did not say

1044
01:03:00.511 --> 01:03:05.511
one word about the boat of Ebola in 2000 people had already died in,

1045
01:03:05.680 --> 01:03:08.850
in Africa.
And it was like not a word in the,

1046
01:03:08.930 --> 01:03:12.630
in the mainstream press at least that week.
And it was like,

1047
01:03:13.060 --> 01:03:15.540
I'm looking for the news and it's like there's nothing there,

1048
01:03:15.541 --> 01:03:18.210
so we have to go digging into the Internet,
you know?

1049
01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:19.860
<v 0>Yeah.
It's weird.</v>

1050
01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:24.400
It's weird to just let people fly over from Africa without testing.

1051
01:03:24.410 --> 01:03:28.020
I couldn't believe it that
Air France was still

1052
01:03:28.110 --> 01:03:31.830
<v 3>flying in and out,
you know?
And um,
my wife and I are looking at each other.</v>

1053
01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:36.630
What is it going on?
Who's,
he was in charge here.
I mean,
the place you'd be like,

1054
01:03:36.660 --> 01:03:37.730
they should be,

1055
01:03:37.930 --> 01:03:42.300
if they quarantine that back then it would've just stayed there,
you know?

1056
01:03:42.301 --> 01:03:43.950
But anyway,

1057
01:03:44.510 --> 01:03:47.950
<v 0>yeah.
Um,
I don't know how dangerous it is.
I'm,
I'm,</v>

1058
01:03:47.951 --> 01:03:52.160
I'm confused by doctors getting it.
That's what gets me so quitting.
We know.

1059
01:03:52.190 --> 01:03:55.610
Anyway.
He just guys are in fucking moonsuits.
How are they getting it?

1060
01:03:55.910 --> 01:03:59.870
Like the doctors know what's contagious and what's not contagious,

1061
01:03:59.871 --> 01:04:01.250
how to treat it,
how to contain it.

1062
01:04:01.460 --> 01:04:03.950
So if they're treating it and these doctors without borders,

1063
01:04:03.951 --> 01:04:08.120
guys like the guy who,
um,
uh,
tested positive in New York City,
this,

1064
01:04:08.250 --> 01:04:11.930
this guy knows he's,
he's aware and how was he getting it?

1065
01:04:11.931 --> 01:04:15.980
Then that's the thing.
They don't know about what's going on.

1066
01:04:15.981 --> 01:04:20.250
And the thing is,
it's,
it evolves,
it's evolving.
That's where everybody starts,

1067
01:04:20.260 --> 01:04:20.550
right?

1068
01:04:20.550 --> 01:04:24.090
<v 3>And it's like,
well,
let's nature,
I mean,
yeah,
what's the,
you know,</v>

1069
01:04:24.091 --> 01:04:26.400
and the thing is they,
it,
you know,

1070
01:04:26.670 --> 01:04:30.350
it's trying to find that perfect thing between,
uh,

1071
01:04:30.540 --> 01:04:34.830
the viruses between killing its host completely.
Because then what good is that?

1072
01:04:34.831 --> 01:04:37.410
Because then there's no place to go.
So they want,

1073
01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:41.820
so the disease wants to find that perfect level where it doesn't really kill

1074
01:04:41.821 --> 01:04:43.180
everybody but it a

1075
01:04:43.260 --> 01:04:47.160
<v 0>place to live.
So this nature,
earth,</v>

1076
01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:51.380
the ocean.
Yeah.
I mean,
a lot of ways that's what we are.
I mean,

1077
01:04:51.460 --> 01:04:55.940
and Bill Hicks calls a virus with shoes.
Boy.
That's right.

1078
01:04:56.320 --> 01:04:58.210
That's it.
And a lot of ways it's,

1079
01:04:58.240 --> 01:05:01.850
it's really what happens all across the board in nature.
You know,
these,

1080
01:05:01.880 --> 01:05:03.980
these predators and prey.

1081
01:05:04.250 --> 01:05:08.900
And in a way these viruses are sort of symbiotic predators.
They eat us,

1082
01:05:08.901 --> 01:05:12.290
but not totally.
They want to just piggyback from one to the other.

1083
01:05:13.850 --> 01:05:18.040
These little tiny animals,
man can't see to just,
just small enough

1084
01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:19.990
<v 3>so you can't see it was with the naked eye.</v>

1085
01:05:19.991 --> 01:05:24.720
But under a microscope you can see these little weird looking animals and they

1086
01:05:24.750 --> 01:05:29.350
are just ready to fuck us over a little yarn.
The kicks our ass.
And then,

1087
01:05:29.351 --> 01:05:33.790
you know,
he'd talk,
talk about going out and uh,
you know,
dealing with bears.

1088
01:05:33.791 --> 01:05:37.330
I mean,
that's like,
I mean,
we can,
I can deal with that,
you know what I mean?

1089
01:05:37.331 --> 01:05:41.510
But it's really,
there's a lot of Buddha going on there with this,
uh,

1090
01:05:41.530 --> 01:05:45.700
with these diseases and what they,
what they know and what they don't,
you know,

1091
01:05:45.770 --> 01:05:48.050
<v 2>it's constantly changing.
It's constantly changing.</v>

1092
01:05:48.051 --> 01:05:51.440
And that's the scariest thing about these diseases that they can morph and they

1093
01:05:51.441 --> 01:05:56.060
can spread into livestock.
And what they're really terrified of is the,
the,

1094
01:05:56.090 --> 01:06:00.980
they see it spreads in bats and a lot of these African communities.

1095
01:06:01.280 --> 01:06:03.560
And that's how a lot of people get it,
but they're worried about it,

1096
01:06:03.561 --> 01:06:05.330
transferring it to some other livestock.

1097
01:06:05.550 --> 01:06:09.110
What was one thing that a lot of folks aren't aware of is a lot of the diseases

1098
01:06:09.111 --> 01:06:12.830
that we have when it comes to flus and all these different viruses.

1099
01:06:12.831 --> 01:06:15.200
And one I'm killing thousands and thousands of people in this country.

1100
01:06:15.440 --> 01:06:20.030
They're transmitted a lot of it through livestock,
right?
Avian flu,
swine flu.

1101
01:06:20.330 --> 01:06:24.710
It's uh,
it's because we have this gross way of storing animals.

1102
01:06:24.910 --> 01:06:28.640
What we make them live in their own shit and we pack them into these boxes and

1103
01:06:28.641 --> 01:06:32.270
we,
right.
And it's just once it catches to one,
I mean,

1104
01:06:32.271 --> 01:06:34.100
it's spreading like wildfire

1105
01:06:34.190 --> 01:06:37.040
<v 3>and there's so much part of,
part of the culture in,</v>

1106
01:06:37.070 --> 01:06:40.940
in other countries where they,
they live with,
with the animals.

1107
01:06:40.941 --> 01:06:44.480
The animals are right there,
you know,
with the,
uh,
uh,
I mean,

1108
01:06:44.481 --> 01:06:46.610
you go to the fire and it's like,
you know,

1109
01:06:46.611 --> 01:06:49.130
the ducks are hanging in the window dead.

1110
01:06:49.131 --> 01:06:51.650
But then there's the live ones swimming right in front of them,
you know,

1111
01:06:51.710 --> 01:06:54.860
and it's all part of the,
they're reading the eggs right there.

1112
01:06:54.861 --> 01:06:58.340
You know what I mean?
So it's,
it's all,
it's,
they live so close,

1113
01:06:58.341 --> 01:07:02.000
it's so easy for it to,
to,
to,
uh,
to,
to get,

1114
01:07:02.400 --> 01:07:06.820
get spread or,
or to evolve so that it will,
I mean,

1115
01:07:07.150 --> 01:07:11.240
boils humans look good,
you know,
so it's,
uh,
you know,

1116
01:07:11.241 --> 01:07:15.590
that's a part of the issue,
you know?
But,
uh,
anyway,

1117
01:07:15.810 --> 01:07:20.480
it seems like that,
uh,
the whole thing there and not an Africa is like,

1118
01:07:21.850 --> 01:07:25.430
I don't know if I saw a headline a couple of nights ago where they actually

1119
01:07:25.431 --> 01:07:28.810
thought,
I mean,
and I thought this is a while ago that it,

1120
01:07:28.910 --> 01:07:33.290
that somebody had weaponized it and there were testing it because it's really

1121
01:07:33.291 --> 01:07:37.400
unusual for it to happen so,
so fast.
So many people,

1122
01:07:37.401 --> 01:07:41.390
cause it happens every year.
They get a,
you know,
the get a little,
a bowl,

1123
01:07:41.391 --> 01:07:45.500
a little typhus,
a little cholera,
you know,
and they,
they keep it under control.

1124
01:07:45.501 --> 01:07:48.870
And that's why they,
they think that they have a handle on it because they've,

1125
01:07:48.920 --> 01:07:53.690
they know how to like,
you know,
isolate it.
And it did.
It's seasonal,

1126
01:07:53.720 --> 01:07:58.640
like the flu and,
uh,
uh,
but for some reason this year,
it just,

1127
01:07:58.910 --> 01:08:03.910
the bullet just blew out and it started to two countries that were separated by

1128
01:08:04.520 --> 01:08:08.600
another country that,
that didn't have any.
So it's like,
how does that happen?

1129
01:08:08.630 --> 01:08:10.610
You know,
without some human intervention,

1130
01:08:11.130 --> 01:08:13.470
<v 2>part of the human intervention can easily just be travel.</v>

1131
01:08:13.500 --> 01:08:16.640
The thing about what used to,
and what happens now is the people,

1132
01:08:16.641 --> 01:08:18.200
anybody can fly anywhere in the world.

1133
01:08:18.201 --> 01:08:21.710
There's not a single place in the world other than like the deep recesses of the

1134
01:08:21.711 --> 01:08:25.820
Congo and the Amazon.
It's truly isolated and people could just fly places.

1135
01:08:25.821 --> 01:08:29.360
And so if someone catches Ebola,
there's a 21 day incubation period.

1136
01:08:29.820 --> 01:08:33.670
So these people are going all over the place and then,
you know,
spreading it.

1137
01:08:33.671 --> 01:08:37.570
It's just any real disease that comes along today,

1138
01:08:37.580 --> 01:08:40.910
like the Spanish flu did in the early 19 hundreds.
Right?

1139
01:08:40.940 --> 01:08:45.750
It's going to kill a lot of people.
I did this show for [inaudible].
Um,

1140
01:08:45.980 --> 01:08:49.800
and one of the things that one of the episodes we did was on weaponized,
uh,

1141
01:08:49.850 --> 01:08:54.850
viruses and diseases and the experts from Russia and the experts from the United

1142
01:08:54.950 --> 01:08:56.630
States.
We're pretty much in agreement.
They said,

1143
01:08:56.631 --> 01:09:00.650
we're not worried nearly as much about human created diseases,

1144
01:09:00.920 --> 01:09:04.250
but we're worried about is nature or worried about nature,

1145
01:09:04.251 --> 01:09:09.251
creating some new pandemic that we do not know how to control and that it hits

1146
01:09:09.801 --> 01:09:12.230
the population and just kills a few million people.

1147
01:09:12.470 --> 01:09:14.930
And they said it's not a matter of if,
but when.

1148
01:09:15.080 --> 01:09:17.330
And so they're just constantly on top of this.
We went out,

1149
01:09:17.570 --> 01:09:20.420
went to the Center for Disease Control.
Someone's phone.

1150
01:09:22.920 --> 01:09:27.920
Was it,
can you not hear that?
I can hear it.
Okay.

1151
01:09:29.150 --> 01:09:31.220
You put it up to your ear.
Um,

1152
01:09:31.221 --> 01:09:35.930
we went to the Center for Disease Control in Galveston and it was creepy as
fuck.

1153
01:09:36.110 --> 01:09:41.110
Cause they have these four foot thick stone walls with these giant thick glass

1154
01:09:41.421 --> 01:09:45.320
windows that they look into and all this crazy ventilation system and

1155
01:09:45.321 --> 01:09:49.820
everybody's walking around these vacuum sealed suits and it's fucking
terrifying.

1156
01:09:49.821 --> 01:09:51.440
And they're all dealing with Ebola,

1157
01:09:51.470 --> 01:09:54.560
these different hemorrhagic viruses that can kill you.

1158
01:09:54.561 --> 01:09:57.440
And they were all in agreement there.

1159
01:09:57.441 --> 01:10:01.490
Like we are not worried about something that a person creates or worried about.

1160
01:10:01.491 --> 01:10:04.850
Nature mutating something and then we can't control it.

1161
01:10:04.880 --> 01:10:05.713
That's what they're all worried.

1162
01:10:06.100 --> 01:10:10.480
<v 3>Hello?
Well,
right now I'm worried that they,
that uh,</v>

1163
01:10:10.540 --> 01:10:13.070
the TSA has just stepped up there.

1164
01:10:13.450 --> 01:10:18.450
They're screening thing if five airports in America and they just started last

1165
01:10:19.370 --> 01:10:23.040
week where they're taking your temperature.
So for us,
um,

1166
01:10:23.540 --> 01:10:27.060
I'm not sure if it's five or whatever,
but it's the major airports this dot.

1167
01:10:27.061 --> 01:10:31.500
And to take people's temperature,
Tsi,
it's fucking coop balls.
I mean,

1168
01:10:31.501 --> 01:10:32.334
come on,

1169
01:10:32.420 --> 01:10:34.590
<v 2>want to just get burger king to do it.
I used to,</v>

1170
01:10:34.591 --> 01:10:37.070
I used to have a joke about that,
but like they would,

1171
01:10:37.110 --> 01:10:40.940
people show up the airport and they'd draw a hat.
Oh Man,
I'm working fries.

1172
01:10:41.170 --> 01:10:43.110
I got bombed control.
You know,

1173
01:10:43.111 --> 01:10:48.111
it's like this is the same amount of expertise involved in checking old ladies

1174
01:10:48.301 --> 01:10:50.400
for bombs.
It is from making a cheeseburger.

1175
01:10:50.790 --> 01:10:51.960
I don't know what the fuck they're doing.

1176
01:10:52.440 --> 01:10:55.260
Checking some old lady who can't even walk and you think she's a terrorist.

1177
01:10:55.460 --> 01:10:59.730
<v 3>We're taking these kids and,
and uh,
well comes up.
Yeah,
I've got a strip them,</v>

1178
01:10:59.890 --> 01:11:00.320
you know?

1179
01:11:00.320 --> 01:11:03.950
<v 2>Yeah.
Well I've seen that there's some videos of them searching children.</v>

1180
01:11:04.160 --> 01:11:04.581
There's this,

1181
01:11:04.581 --> 01:11:08.600
there was some old lady who literally couldn't walk and they had to help her

1182
01:11:08.810 --> 01:11:12.270
into that fucking stupid machine where you keep your hands up.
This,

1183
01:11:12.280 --> 01:11:14.400
this lady couldn't walk,
man.
I mean,
she,

1184
01:11:14.401 --> 01:11:17.670
they wheeled her up to the machine and she's an obvious pain.

1185
01:11:17.820 --> 01:11:22.500
She has to get up and stand and she shaking as she's trying to stand and she

1186
01:11:22.501 --> 01:11:26.370
needs to not faking.
You see massive atrophy in her legs.

1187
01:11:26.490 --> 01:11:28.710
So she probably spends most of her time in a wheelchair.

1188
01:11:28.711 --> 01:11:32.650
She's severely compromised and they're checking her for like,
she's,

1189
01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:35.040
she's wired up with a bomb like grand.

1190
01:11:35.041 --> 01:11:39.090
He's going to take out the fucking airplane.
Yeah.
But you know,
it's,
it's sad,

1191
01:11:39.240 --> 01:11:41.900
<v 3>but you know what somebody's,
it owes.</v>

1192
01:11:42.030 --> 01:11:46.410
The next thing you're going to hear is somebody who had that stupid weird shit

1193
01:11:46.440 --> 01:11:49.680
wheelchair wired up.
You know what I mean?
Who knows.

1194
01:11:49.720 --> 01:11:52.600
<v 2>It was not that long ago.
You didn't have to take your shoes off.
Right.</v>

1195
01:11:52.630 --> 01:11:55.310
That's fucking Dick Wad tried to blow his shoes up I think.

1196
01:11:55.590 --> 01:11:58.510
I think I didn't take off my shoes at the last time.
They're like,

1197
01:11:58.520 --> 01:11:59.500
oh it'll keep your shoes on now.

1198
01:11:59.520 --> 01:12:02.400
Did you go through the Tsa pre did you might have had a memory check.

1199
01:12:03.060 --> 01:12:04.060
I just had normal.

1200
01:12:04.570 --> 01:12:07.510
But sometimes they give you pre oh like you don't even realize it.

1201
01:12:07.511 --> 01:12:10.390
They put the market on your like I've had,
I've got pre before what?

1202
01:12:10.391 --> 01:12:13.590
I didn't even sign up for it.
They just,
for whatever reason,
I don't know.

1203
01:12:13.640 --> 01:12:16.270
<v 3>No,
it's so arbitrary.
It's like yeah,</v>

1204
01:12:16.370 --> 01:12:19.310
it's goofy and I can't make any sense of it.

1205
01:12:19.340 --> 01:12:23.750
And it's like I have an artificial knee,
so even going through the machine,

1206
01:12:23.990 --> 01:12:28.850
which doesn't show my knee,
which it should,
you know.
Um,
cause I've looked at the,

1207
01:12:28.960 --> 01:12:33.960
at the screen I still have to get stripped down and I have to still take my

1208
01:12:34.011 --> 01:12:35.270
shoes off,
take off the belt.

1209
01:12:35.310 --> 01:12:38.270
<v 2>Do we have to take all his chains off too?
Right.
You've got funny bare teeth.</v>

1210
01:12:38.770 --> 01:12:39.730
He got,
there you go.
Well,

1211
01:12:39.750 --> 01:12:44.480
<v 3>what's the user from the last,
not the last time.
Uh,
the family went hunting.</v>

1212
01:12:44.740 --> 01:12:48.970
These are from the one of the boards we got.
Oh,
there's a teeth.
Yeah,

1213
01:12:50.110 --> 01:12:54.010
I made these,
I made one for each of the boys and me.
Wow.

1214
01:12:54.270 --> 01:12:56.980
Instability because we all,
we all scored.

1215
01:12:57.850 --> 01:13:00.010
Where'd you guys hunt down in Florida.

1216
01:13:00.011 --> 01:13:04.990
There's a reserve down there where they,
uh,
um,
it's,

1217
01:13:04.991 --> 01:13:08.830
it's just,
they basically,
the guy doesn't even know what's on the land.
It's just,

1218
01:13:08.940 --> 01:13:09.773
you know,

1219
01:13:09.910 --> 01:13:14.910
10 square acres or miles cordoned off and you can go out and you can hunt.

1220
01:13:16.360 --> 01:13:20.530
Oh.
And so you got a bore and then turn it into a necklace.
Well,
yeah,

1221
01:13:20.660 --> 01:13:23.140
they let you on the plane with us and get you fucking take over the plan with

1222
01:13:23.141 --> 01:13:28.030
that.
I'll tell you.
And I had a fake a two to three that I had bought.

1223
01:13:28.060 --> 01:13:32.360
An Army Navy store was empty and uh,
they,
they make me,

1224
01:13:32.440 --> 01:13:36.430
made me take it off and Brazil of all places.
I mean,

1225
01:13:36.440 --> 01:13:41.200
I've flown all over the,
all over the world.
I mean,
Japan everywhere.

1226
01:13:41.470 --> 01:13:46.240
And when one guy looked at it and said,
well you can't,
you can't take that.

1227
01:13:46.750 --> 01:13:50.180
And it's just,
uh,
you know,
I mean it was a real one,
but it didn't have anything.

1228
01:13:50.470 --> 01:13:51.930
I mean it was,
I mean,

1229
01:13:51.970 --> 01:13:54.010
cause you can shake them and tell if there's anything in it.

1230
01:13:55.090 --> 01:13:59.750
It was obviously a dummy.
What,
how'd you get a fake knee?
Um,

1231
01:13:59.800 --> 01:14:03.550
while I fell off the stage,
uh,
let's see,

1232
01:14:03.551 --> 01:14:08.110
probably going on 30 years ago.
Billy one was it now,
um,

1233
01:14:09.840 --> 01:14:12.400
at the end of his show,
it was in Dallas I think.

1234
01:14:12.401 --> 01:14:17.401
And I fell off the stage and had basically tore a ligament and we,

1235
01:14:18.460 --> 01:14:22.620
she was pregnant and with our first with Tony or first son,
so that,

1236
01:14:22.640 --> 01:14:27.490
that makes it almost 29 years ago.
And,
uh,
and I,
uh,

1237
01:14:28.250 --> 01:14:29.490
we were booked to go into,

1238
01:14:29.560 --> 01:14:34.270
on a dive vacation the next day and rather than going and get it operated on,

1239
01:14:34.271 --> 01:14:36.760
so I could have been walking the next week.
I said,
well,

1240
01:14:36.761 --> 01:14:39.070
we're not going to give up.
The deposit will go on.

1241
01:14:39.160 --> 01:14:42.310
We're going to go diving and they'll lift me into the water or whatever.

1242
01:14:42.710 --> 01:14:43.900
And it was,

1243
01:14:44.350 --> 01:14:49.330
they tried it the first day and it was the most agonizing pain I ever felt.

1244
01:14:49.660 --> 01:14:54.460
Cause for some reason the water like separated the,
the knee and all that stuff.

1245
01:14:54.461 --> 01:14:58.150
So we couldn't do anything but lay on the beach for two weeks,
which didn't suck.

1246
01:14:58.180 --> 01:15:02.680
But it wasn't the dive vacation we had envisioned because Billy couldn't dive

1247
01:15:02.681 --> 01:15:06.670
cause she was pregnant and I couldn't dive because my knee was fucked.
And then,

1248
01:15:06.910 --> 01:15:10.090
so when I got back,
I,
I had it operated on and

1249
01:15:11.680 --> 01:15:14.770
three operations later,
they finally said,
you've got to have it replaced.

1250
01:15:15.160 --> 01:15:19.610
The exact damage.
Well,
uh,
abuse,
I mean,

1251
01:15:19.611 --> 01:15:22.150
th th th it was torn a torn ligament,
you know,

1252
01:15:22.450 --> 01:15:26.770
really common sports injury and football guys get it and they're back playing

1253
01:15:26.771 --> 01:15:28.990
the next week.
You know,
when it first happened,

1254
01:15:28.991 --> 01:15:33.470
but it wore away in an immoral way more.
And then they had to put in a,
uh,

1255
01:15:33.560 --> 01:15:38.080
a tendon from a cadaver,
you know,
and,
you know,

1256
01:15:38.081 --> 01:15:42.190
so finally,
I,
uh,
I put it off as long as I could,
and then if,

1257
01:15:42.280 --> 01:15:45.610
then I just had to have the knee put in.
So when they do an artificial knee,

1258
01:15:45.640 --> 01:15:49.630
what they have to saw off the end of your bone and put this thing and screw it

1259
01:15:49.631 --> 01:15:53.880
in place like they do now.
Apparently I was sleeping at the time,
um,

1260
01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:59.000
as deeply as possible,
I might add,
but apparently they don't.

1261
01:15:59.060 --> 01:15:59.920
When I went to sleep,

1262
01:15:59.921 --> 01:16:02.830
I saw the tools of the trade and it looked like they were putting,

1263
01:16:03.110 --> 01:16:07.780
working on an old car,
you know what I mean?
It's like they got saws and fucking,

1264
01:16:07.890 --> 01:16:11.980
you know,
screwdrivers and,
and they're talking about golf,
you know,
and I mean,

1265
01:16:12.550 --> 01:16:15.760
and they got a wall full of full of parts because they need,

1266
01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.520
because everybody's needs different,
you know,
and they don't know,

1267
01:16:18.521 --> 01:16:20.320
once they get in there what they're going to need.

1268
01:16:20.321 --> 01:16:25.321
So they have just about every part you can imagine that will fit on the wall.

1269
01:16:25.510 --> 01:16:27.370
So they,
they do it all the time.

1270
01:16:27.371 --> 01:16:31.720
That's all they do with this hospital is knee replacements,
hip replaced,

1271
01:16:31.721 --> 01:16:33.280
whatever.
And uh,

1272
01:16:33.290 --> 01:16:38.140
a lot of the sports guys go up there in Boston and,
uh,
they,
uh,

1273
01:16:38.650 --> 01:16:41.260
um,
they,
that's what they do,
I guess.

1274
01:16:41.261 --> 01:16:45.820
Like they cut off certain parts and nail nail the thing in there.

1275
01:16:46.110 --> 01:16:47.650
And uh,
and this,

1276
01:16:47.660 --> 01:16:52.120
there's a couple of pieces of titanium in there as well as some,

1277
01:16:52.180 --> 01:16:56.140
some like tough law and other other stuff.
They have better ones now.

1278
01:16:56.141 --> 01:16:58.810
I had mine done about,
I don't know,
five or six years ago,

1279
01:16:59.050 --> 01:17:03.520
but the thing is nine months later it never got,

1280
01:17:03.580 --> 01:17:06.730
it didn't get any better.
It kept staying swollen.

1281
01:17:06.760 --> 01:17:10.550
And I went in and had it tested and they said,
you gotta go,

1282
01:17:10.580 --> 01:17:13.070
you gotta be operated on the next day.

1283
01:17:13.100 --> 01:17:16.940
And we got to go in there and clean it out because it's on the verge of going

1284
01:17:16.970 --> 01:17:21.350
septic,
which is
infection and,

1285
01:17:21.380 --> 01:17:25.850
and uh,
do you know what it was either staff or something.

1286
01:17:26.150 --> 01:17:30.050
It's one of the two that they did.
People get all the time and they,

1287
01:17:30.170 --> 01:17:33.140
they think that it happened when I was getting the first one put in,

1288
01:17:33.530 --> 01:17:37.580
when I got the knee put in and,
and my body fought it off as long as it could.

1289
01:17:37.610 --> 01:17:41.390
And then finally the,
it just was on the verge of going,
you know,

1290
01:17:41.510 --> 01:17:43.670
what happens is it gets into your blood and it gets,

1291
01:17:43.730 --> 01:17:47.150
you get blood poisoning and then he can really get sick and then you,

1292
01:17:47.180 --> 01:17:50.970
then you were in the hospital for months if you're wanting to shoo sure.

1293
01:17:51.040 --> 01:17:55.670
Operations,
right.
Well,
hey,
sick people go to hospitals,
men and it's,

1294
01:17:55.700 --> 01:18:00.380
they do everything they can do,
you know,
um,
to keep it clean.
But it's,

1295
01:18:00.381 --> 01:18:04.550
it's a,
it is a big issue about that.
The getting the infection.

1296
01:18:04.850 --> 01:18:08.300
<v 2>Well it's also a big issue because of antibiotics because antibiotics fight off</v>

1297
01:18:08.301 --> 01:18:12.260
these strains.
The only one most virulent strain survive and then it becomes,

1298
01:18:12.261 --> 01:18:16.820
they become antibiotic resistant and that's where it gets really scary because

1299
01:18:16.970 --> 01:18:18.560
people can get these Murcia,

1300
01:18:18.600 --> 01:18:22.280
there's medication resistance trains and you know,

1301
01:18:22.281 --> 01:18:26.130
they're on the verge of death and it's touch and go the whole way there.

1302
01:18:26.150 --> 01:18:27.680
Pump pumping them full of medication.

1303
01:18:27.681 --> 01:18:31.190
They're in a hospital and they're still on the verge of death is almost nothing

1304
01:18:31.191 --> 01:18:34.330
they can do to fight off some of those.
When they,
when it gets bad,

1305
01:18:34.340 --> 01:18:35.870
it really gets a grip on you.
And again,

1306
01:18:35.871 --> 01:18:39.320
same thing you were talking about earlier,
it's like,
it just,
it's,
uh,

1307
01:18:39.620 --> 01:18:41.180
something that's feeding off of you.

1308
01:18:41.181 --> 01:18:46.070
It's like a virus that just gets a hold of you and you know,
you are the host now

1309
01:18:46.160 --> 01:18:49.780
<v 3>and you're wide open.
I mean,
the thing is laid,
opened it,
it's like just,
you know,</v>

1310
01:18:49.950 --> 01:18:52.980
here it's picnic time,
you know?
Yeah.

1311
01:18:53.530 --> 01:18:57.140
<v 2>Tufts scary stuff.
So now when you walk around,
you don't have a limp at all.</v>

1312
01:18:57.640 --> 01:19:01.690
<v 3>Well,
it's,
that's the good part about it.
It's like it's working.
Well,</v>

1313
01:19:01.691 --> 01:19:05.890
it doesn't hurt when I'm,
um,
like 90% of the time there's,
I have to,

1314
01:19:06.190 --> 01:19:07.150
like if I'm on a plane,

1315
01:19:07.151 --> 01:19:11.470
I have to move it like every 45 minutes or else it gets stiff,
then it'll hurt.

1316
01:19:11.830 --> 01:19:15.940
But I know they have a new generation that I'm,
in fact,

1317
01:19:15.941 --> 01:19:20.020
Steven just got his replace him and his is a new,
uh,
a new,

1318
01:19:20.740 --> 01:19:25.740
a new one because the old one's bent one way and apparently your knee bends kind

1319
01:19:25.810 --> 01:19:26.710
of two ways.

1320
01:19:26.711 --> 01:19:30.790
And now the new one's been the two ways and they're better and they're less,

1321
01:19:31.570 --> 01:19:35.650
I guess it's less invasive to the way they put it in.
They're always getting,

1322
01:19:35.651 --> 01:19:40.300
making it better,
but uh,
it's still going to upgrade.
Well,

1323
01:19:40.710 --> 01:19:45.490
my mother had one and uh,
she had to have his replaced in 15 years.
She,

1324
01:19:45.491 --> 01:19:48.400
she,
uh,
she was an athletic,
uh,

1325
01:19:48.460 --> 01:19:52.190
instructor and she kept doing the aerobic stuff,
you know,

1326
01:19:52.191 --> 01:19:56.890
as she got older and she wore it out and uh,
so she had to have it replaced.

1327
01:19:57.340 --> 01:20:00.910
So I dunno,
I'm going to have it.
I'm due for a,
for an eye,

1328
01:20:00.911 --> 01:20:05.890
like a 50,000 mile check and uh,
they'll uh,
they'll see,

1329
01:20:06.070 --> 01:20:08.160
you know,
cause uh,
you can't have Tyler walking

1330
01:20:08.160 --> 01:20:11.110
<v 2>around with an upgraded model.
It's like,
you know what I mean?</v>

1331
01:20:11.430 --> 01:20:14.150
Nothing's going to stop meeting them and know the difference.
I mean,

1332
01:20:14.750 --> 01:20:17.430
you to keep up with the Joneses mad.
He got to get one of them new ones.

1333
01:20:17.820 --> 01:20:21.500
I'm fine with him doing all the dance and you,
he's great at it.

1334
01:20:21.790 --> 01:20:23.730
You can still dance with his new name and everything.

1335
01:20:23.800 --> 01:20:28.520
<v 1>Does he,
he,
he,
he did all the therapy.
You know,
like I said,</v>

1336
01:20:28.600 --> 01:20:32.080
nothing's going to stop them,
you know,
I mean,
it's built and he's,
he's,

1337
01:20:32.470 --> 01:20:34.420
he's designed to do what he does.

1338
01:20:34.790 --> 01:20:37.940
<v 2>It's great.
It's just amazing that they can do that now.
I mean,</v>

1339
01:20:38.450 --> 01:20:41.170
we've got robot rock stars.
That's essentially what's going on,
right?

1340
01:20:41.330 --> 01:20:43.690
<v 1>Yeah.
I mean,
you know,
it's,
it's like kind of like,</v>

1341
01:20:43.810 --> 01:20:46.330
what's that damn a noodle that they used to keep changing the,

1342
01:20:46.390 --> 01:20:51.070
once he hits it did throw them out and then they'd get a new one and so they get

1343
01:20:51.071 --> 01:20:55.120
this band that's like,
it's like the hammer that got handed down from,
you know,

1344
01:20:55.121 --> 01:20:57.160
your great,
great,
great grandfather.

1345
01:20:57.161 --> 01:21:00.790
Only they had to replace the head five times in the handle six times.

1346
01:21:01.090 --> 01:21:03.790
So it's the same hammer only it's been,
you know,

1347
01:21:03.900 --> 01:21:05.940
<v 2>well that's what kiss has done.
They,
they,
you know,</v>

1348
01:21:05.941 --> 01:21:08.340
they have a new Peter Criss in a new ace freely.

1349
01:21:08.700 --> 01:21:12.270
They just make up these other dudes and like,
you're the,
you know,
you just,

1350
01:21:12.450 --> 01:21:16.110
you're the star child now.
Fuck.
I'll fuck Paul Stanley.

1351
01:21:16.140 --> 01:21:18.900
I know he's gone through star child.
I don't know

1352
01:21:18.970 --> 01:21:21.530
<v 1>they can go that far,
but anybody could,</v>

1353
01:21:21.540 --> 01:21:24.040
if anybody can do what they can cause they got the makeup.

1354
01:21:24.290 --> 01:21:27.310
<v 2>Yeah.
The um,
yeah,
it's uh,</v>

1355
01:21:28.020 --> 01:21:33.020
just Menounos a weird band too because have you ever eaten menudo no,

1356
01:21:34.600 --> 01:21:38.250
I know what it is.
No.
And they still,
I mean,
I heard about them in the eye,

1357
01:21:38.270 --> 01:21:41.060
you know,
years ago,
but are they still around?
I mean,
I know,

1358
01:21:41.061 --> 01:21:43.400
but I'm saying the food maneuver.
No,
what is it?

1359
01:21:43.550 --> 01:21:46.340
There's a place called Pupusa has in Boulder,
Colorado,

1360
01:21:46.341 --> 01:21:48.830
this fucking great Mexican joint and they,
uh,

1361
01:21:48.831 --> 01:21:51.920
they have this dish called Minuto and minuto is,

1362
01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:57.000
it's supposed to be a great hangover cure and it's like tripe and Oregon's and,

1363
01:21:57.711 --> 01:22:02.240
and all this beef stuff.
And it's in a spicy broth.
It's fucking fantastic.

1364
01:22:02.241 --> 01:22:06.440
It's got chickpeas in it and it's,
it's really good.
I mean,

1365
01:22:06.470 --> 01:22:10.130
if you were into that stuff,
nobody's twice,
even if nobody told you what it was,

1366
01:22:10.270 --> 01:22:11.990
he would probably love it.
Yeah.

1367
01:22:11.991 --> 01:22:14.240
But you'd be like digging in there and there's bones in it.

1368
01:22:14.240 --> 01:22:17.170
Like what the fuck is his,
I was like a bomb.

1369
01:22:17.240 --> 01:22:20.930
It's like all this weird stuff,
you know,
that they throw in there.

1370
01:22:20.931 --> 01:22:24.880
It's a classic Mexican dish that they,
they serve like,

1371
01:22:25.100 --> 01:22:28.940
like a post hangover,
you know,
Mexicans love their survey,
says,
yeah,

1372
01:22:28.980 --> 01:22:32.350
this is what it looks like.
That's a good,
is that from pupusas website?

1373
01:22:32.450 --> 01:22:34.970
Does that somewhere else.
But it looks just like that.

1374
01:22:35.090 --> 01:22:39.470
But it's like a lot of that's tripe and Oregon's and liver and,
and,

1375
01:22:39.471 --> 01:22:42.830
and in those chickpeas in there,
it's fucking fantastic.

1376
01:22:43.100 --> 01:22:47.870
But that's minuto this foul looking elixir.

1377
01:22:47.930 --> 01:22:50.690
I wonder what they,
what are they called?
The van that it looks like,

1378
01:22:50.691 --> 01:22:54.710
which is broth.
Like some fucking something a which would stir up in a cauldron.

1379
01:22:54.770 --> 01:22:55.603
Oh Man.

1380
01:22:56.420 --> 01:23:01.420
First Time I had tripe was last time I had went out stomach,

1381
01:23:02.481 --> 01:23:06.070
I believe stomach lining or whatever.
And

1382
01:23:06.070 --> 01:23:10.600
<v 3>it's like,
and the thing is you,
you,
uh,
it's like,
it's kind of like,
um,</v>

1383
01:23:11.080 --> 01:23:15.940
like squid,
you know,
uh,
Calamari.
It's got that same kind of consistency.
Only.

1384
01:23:16.180 --> 01:23:18.190
Only it doesn't chew it.
I mean,
you can chew it,

1385
01:23:18.191 --> 01:23:22.000
but it doesn't break into smaller pieces.
You have to keep chewing it,
you know,

1386
01:23:22.600 --> 01:23:27.340
at least this stuff.
We had an a and it was really like it was,
it was,
you know,

1387
01:23:27.341 --> 01:23:29.500
and the,
and the,
the guy who turned us onto it,

1388
01:23:29.501 --> 01:23:33.040
it was a promoter and we went out to dinner after a show and he was like,

1389
01:23:33.160 --> 01:23:35.650
you know,
you've got to try this and you know,
and thank you.

1390
01:23:35.800 --> 01:23:40.420
But I was never again,
you know,
it's like a sea urchin.

1391
01:23:40.421 --> 01:23:42.970
I can't stand sea urchins Sushi,
you know what I mean?

1392
01:23:42.971 --> 01:23:45.460
It's just doesn't agree with me and okay.

1393
01:23:45.650 --> 01:23:46.610
<v 2>You didn't,</v>

1394
01:23:46.611 --> 01:23:50.600
you have like plans on being some sort of a marine biologist or something at

1395
01:23:50.601 --> 01:23:53.540
some point I tell people that story because this is funny.

1396
01:23:53.840 --> 01:23:55.880
On Twitter I found this rock,

1397
01:23:55.881 --> 01:23:59.210
my daughter found this rock on the beach in Santa Barbara and how all these

1398
01:23:59.211 --> 01:24:02.210
holes in it and we're trying to figure out what the fuck it was was an asteroid

1399
01:24:02.211 --> 01:24:03.530
or something.
I put on Twitter,
I go,

1400
01:24:03.710 --> 01:24:08.660
what's this rock Joe fucking Perry is the first guy to answer me on Twitter and

1401
01:24:08.661 --> 01:24:10.130
tells me it's a see stone.

1402
01:24:10.131 --> 01:24:14.420
Like these animals had like burrowed into this stone and created a little homes

1403
01:24:14.670 --> 01:24:16.150
<v 3>really well.
Um,</v>

1404
01:24:19.560 --> 01:24:23.350
well anyway,
listen,
I,

1405
01:24:24.510 --> 01:24:29.100
I love the ocean and Rick caption me for the very beginning.
I mean,

1406
01:24:29.101 --> 01:24:33.360
I love,
I love Jacques Cousteau and watching those,
those specials and,

1407
01:24:33.370 --> 01:24:37.770
and I got to see,
see him speak a couple times in Boston.

1408
01:24:37.771 --> 01:24:40.050
And I just was,
that's what I wanted to be.

1409
01:24:40.080 --> 01:24:43.940
I wanted to be when I went to woods hole and you know,

1410
01:24:43.950 --> 01:24:47.520
visited there and,
and uh,
uh,
and I,

1411
01:24:47.590 --> 01:24:51.800
and I thought that's what I wanted to do was be a marine biologist and uh,

1412
01:24:52.230 --> 01:24:55.430
you know,
and the whole learning disability thing,
um,

1413
01:24:56.250 --> 01:25:00.240
which they didn't know what to call it back then except the discipline thing,

1414
01:25:00.241 --> 01:25:03.860
you know what I mean?
I wasn't studying hard enough foil.
I wanted to,

1415
01:25:04.050 --> 01:25:06.960
wanted to get good grades.
They studied as hard as I could.
I mean,

1416
01:25:06.961 --> 01:25:08.520
it looked at the page,
read it,

1417
01:25:08.970 --> 01:25:12.000
nothing's stuck and couldn't get grades.

1418
01:25:12.270 --> 01:25:16.890
Now it's like a Adhd,
I guess they call it now.
And,

1419
01:25:16.891 --> 01:25:21.600
uh,
and that's where,
uh,
they have different ways to teach kids now.

1420
01:25:21.601 --> 01:25:25.230
And it doesn't involve,
you know,
like taking some pills.

1421
01:25:25.231 --> 01:25:29.460
I mean there's just different ways of teaching that that work and they just

1422
01:25:29.461 --> 01:25:32.460
didn't have it back then when they know what it was,
you know,

1423
01:25:32.590 --> 01:25:33.130
<v 2>did that,</v>

1424
01:25:33.130 --> 01:25:36.610
that's also probably what led you to be such a fucking awesome guitarist.

1425
01:25:36.940 --> 01:25:41.860
It's like there's something about people that can't accept traditional learning

1426
01:25:41.861 --> 01:25:46.861
environments and then some are every now and then one of them becomes like an

1427
01:25:46.901 --> 01:25:51.370
amazing video game designer or one of them becomes an amazing guitarist or an

1428
01:25:51.371 --> 01:25:55.450
amazing artist.
But sitting in a classroom or you know,

1429
01:25:55.451 --> 01:26:00.451
being forced into traditional sort of learning environments sometimes doesn't

1430
01:26:00.791 --> 01:26:01.690
work with people.

1431
01:26:01.810 --> 01:26:06.810
But those same people have this uncanny ability to pick up musical instruments

1432
01:26:07.311 --> 01:26:10.820
or art or it's almost like we're just not recognizing this,

1433
01:26:10.821 --> 01:26:14.390
the broad spectrum of,
of,
of,
of human development.

1434
01:26:14.391 --> 01:26:15.890
And some people just are different.

1435
01:26:16.220 --> 01:26:20.630
And so we want everybody to fit into this sort of box of how they learn or how

1436
01:26:20.631 --> 01:26:21.860
they think or how they,

1437
01:26:22.040 --> 01:26:26.960
how they can benefit and benefit society,

1438
01:26:27.080 --> 01:26:28.700
how they can fit into our culture.

1439
01:26:28.880 --> 01:26:31.490
<v 3>Well,
I think that that's what's happening and that's,</v>

1440
01:26:31.520 --> 01:26:36.210
there are in fact the prep school that I went to when my parents sent me that to

1441
01:26:36.350 --> 01:26:41.240
immerse me into the,
that culture more to,
to try and get me into college,

1442
01:26:41.241 --> 01:26:43.790
you know,
um,
it was just more of the same,

1443
01:26:44.330 --> 01:26:47.510
same old school learning,
which was,
you know,

1444
01:26:47.540 --> 01:26:52.240
sit there and memorize what your,
it's the same,
same thing.
Now I'm not,

1445
01:26:52.340 --> 01:26:53.360
I dunno how they do it,

1446
01:26:53.361 --> 01:26:56.960
but that there are different ways to get kids so that they can,

1447
01:26:57.260 --> 01:27:01.220
they can learn or at least motivate them so they can at least get,

1448
01:27:01.400 --> 01:27:04.850
get through that,
whatever they have to get through.
But on the other hand,

1449
01:27:04.970 --> 01:27:09.860
you know,
I mean,
I don't know.
I think my brain is wired different.
I mean,
I just,

1450
01:27:09.890 --> 01:27:12.830
just talking to different artists,
you know,
uh,

1451
01:27:13.100 --> 01:27:17.540
and looking at history and looking at painters and writers and,

1452
01:27:17.750 --> 01:27:21.740
you know,
sculptors and how,
what motivates them and you know,

1453
01:27:22.090 --> 01:27:26.000
the issues they had,
you know,
growing up in that kind of thing and how they,
they,

1454
01:27:26.270 --> 01:27:31.190
they knew what they wanted to do from the start.
I unfortunately didn't,
you know,

1455
01:27:31.191 --> 01:27:33.680
um,
but,
but that drive,

1456
01:27:33.681 --> 01:27:38.110
I think that if I had been allowed to get through that,
that,
uh,

1457
01:27:38.480 --> 01:27:41.780
stereotypical,
you know,
way of learning,
um,

1458
01:27:42.320 --> 01:27:46.880
I could probably could have thrived in that,
in that,
um,
um,

1459
01:27:47.150 --> 01:27:51.260
uh,
environment,
you know,
uh,
being on,
on one of those boats,
you know,

1460
01:27:51.350 --> 01:27:56.060
going out the way the sea shepherds do or the way that,
uh,
the,
you know,

1461
01:27:56.070 --> 01:28:00.590
the woods hole guys do,
or Ballard,
you know,
that goes out.
I mean,

1462
01:28:00.980 --> 01:28:05.820
he was,
for all we know,
he was a dummy in school,
you know what I mean?
And,

1463
01:28:05.821 --> 01:28:07.940
and may make his way through,
you know,

1464
01:28:08.020 --> 01:28:12.430
<v 2>it's good that they fucked you over.
Well,
I mean,
then we have Joe Perry,</v>

1465
01:28:12.431 --> 01:28:14.050
the musician,
the world had been robbed.

1466
01:28:14.051 --> 01:28:18.730
You've been out there catching fish and shit and how Smith would've sat so much

1467
01:28:18.731 --> 01:28:20.470
different,
it would have fucked up the whole world.

1468
01:28:21.100 --> 01:28:24.010
It's like everything falls into it's proper.

1469
01:28:24.400 --> 01:28:28.270
<v 3>Listen,
I read it enough science fiction.
I mean,
I've been asked that a bunch,</v>

1470
01:28:28.271 --> 01:28:29.390
you know,
to say,
you know,

1471
01:28:29.410 --> 01:28:34.120
what would you be doing if you didn't do that music or what,
you know,
whatever.

1472
01:28:34.121 --> 01:28:37.820
And you know,
I have to say,
you know,
that,
you know,

1473
01:28:37.990 --> 01:28:42.460
reading enough science fiction and all that shit about time travel,
you know,

1474
01:28:42.461 --> 01:28:46.580
that if you screw something up in the,
in the past,
chances are,
you know,

1475
01:28:46.600 --> 01:28:50.050
the is going to fall and everything's going,
it's going to screw everything up.

1476
01:28:50.051 --> 01:28:55.051
And I have to say that I've got a beautiful wife and four great kids and they're

1477
01:28:55.271 --> 01:28:59.680
doing great and,
and I got this,
this band and,
and you know,

1478
01:28:59.681 --> 01:29:04.290
for what it's worth,
um,
you know,
I mean it has its ups and downs and,
uh,

1479
01:29:04.770 --> 01:29:08.620
but uh,
you know,
I couldn't say if I could change anything,
you know what I mean?

1480
01:29:08.870 --> 01:29:13.290
No,
but I did have go through some agony.
There was a kid,
you know,

1481
01:29:13.680 --> 01:29:16.050
but I think a lot of people can relate to that,
you know?

1482
01:29:16.110 --> 01:29:20.420
<v 2>Yeah.
Well,
schools designed for the average person.
I mean,</v>

1483
01:29:20.470 --> 01:29:23.970
it's designed to try to educate children as much as they can.

1484
01:29:24.090 --> 01:29:26.190
This idea that there's some sort of a grand conspiracy.

1485
01:29:26.191 --> 01:29:30.240
I get really angry when people talk about grand conspiracies when it comes to

1486
01:29:30.241 --> 01:29:32.790
education.
I don't buy into it for a fucking second.

1487
01:29:33.120 --> 01:29:37.560
I think the real issue when it comes to education is that it's,

1488
01:29:37.580 --> 01:29:42.330
it's financial for the most part and it's a matter of respect for teachers and

1489
01:29:42.331 --> 01:29:45.050
it's a matter of,
I mean,
what are the resources would,
where's,

1490
01:29:45.051 --> 01:29:45.990
where's the money going?

1491
01:29:45.991 --> 01:29:50.010
How much resources do they have to work with every kid and try to find each

1492
01:29:50.011 --> 01:29:51.780
kid's individual needs.

1493
01:29:52.040 --> 01:29:56.220
It was very difficult when the guy like you is different from a guy like him or

1494
01:29:56.221 --> 01:29:59.370
him or anybody in this room.
We were all different and some,

1495
01:29:59.550 --> 01:30:03.360
some people thrive under traditional environments for education and some people

1496
01:30:03.361 --> 01:30:07.350
just fucking don't.
And I was one of the don'ts.
You know,
I'm not an idiot,

1497
01:30:07.560 --> 01:30:09.600
but I just,
from my brain,

1498
01:30:09.630 --> 01:30:13.530
I have to be interested in something in order to pursue it.
If I'm interested,

1499
01:30:14.010 --> 01:30:17.940
then I have this crazy laser beam intensity and I'll,

1500
01:30:17.941 --> 01:30:22.560
I'll fucking binge on things until I pass out.
I'll,
I'll,
I'll do things 12,

1501
01:30:22.561 --> 01:30:26.610
13 hours a day.
But if I'm not interested,
I just,
I could stare at it,

1502
01:30:26.611 --> 01:30:30.420
I'll can read it and then I'll get through the test.
But then once it's over,

1503
01:30:30.421 --> 01:30:32.550
I don't remember a fucking thing.
I learned,

1504
01:30:32.660 --> 01:30:33.920
<v 3>well,
I couldn't get through the test,</v>

1505
01:30:33.921 --> 01:30:36.670
but I totally relate to what you're talking about,
you know,
and I see,

1506
01:30:36.780 --> 01:30:40.430
and I see it and my kids,
my kids have this drive that,
you know,
when they,

1507
01:30:40.460 --> 01:30:45.020
when they have a goal,
they go for it.
You know.
And fortunately they've,

1508
01:30:45.290 --> 01:30:50.240
they're able to deal with the traditional school thing,
but,
you know,
they,
they,

1509
01:30:50.241 --> 01:30:53.380
we were homeschooled him,
you know,
Billy,
you know,

1510
01:30:53.420 --> 01:30:58.100
took the Montessori model and you know,
and brought them up that way.

1511
01:30:58.101 --> 01:31:02.470
And then,
uh,
um,
and then when it came time for them to,

1512
01:31:02.560 --> 01:31:06.230
to have to do real learning,
you know,
you know,

1513
01:31:06.231 --> 01:31:08.630
we have to fill out like all the things,
all the forms.

1514
01:31:08.631 --> 01:31:12.320
So you meet up with all the regulations.

1515
01:31:12.710 --> 01:31:17.590
We brought a tutor on the,
on the bus and they were,
you know,
the bulk of it was,

1516
01:31:17.690 --> 01:31:21.590
was done that way and he,
he works with them and,
and uh,
and,

1517
01:31:21.770 --> 01:31:26.720
and adapted what they needed,
you know.
And so,
um,
in a way,

1518
01:31:26.721 --> 01:31:27.830
you know,
they,
they did,

1519
01:31:28.160 --> 01:31:33.160
they did learn most of their get most of their schooling outside of the,

1520
01:31:33.920 --> 01:31:36.530
you know,
the public school box thing,

1521
01:31:36.531 --> 01:31:41.060
which is every year it gets cut down more and more.
I mean,
I mean,

1522
01:31:41.750 --> 01:31:45.650
one thing,
take music for example.
I mean,
there,
there are so many,
I mean,

1523
01:31:45.651 --> 01:31:50.250
there are no more music programs anymore.
I mean,
yeah,
I mean,
I do,
uh,

1524
01:31:50.300 --> 01:31:54.810
as much as I can to,
to,
to do fundraisers.
So,

1525
01:31:55.130 --> 01:31:58.880
you know,
really to contribute instruments to the,
to the,
uh,

1526
01:31:58.900 --> 01:32:02.740
to schools so they can,
so maybe they could recognize it.
Some,

1527
01:32:02.741 --> 01:32:05.560
somebody as talented,
they shouldn't do that.
You know what I mean?

1528
01:32:05.561 --> 01:32:06.394
Instead of like,

1529
01:32:06.400 --> 01:32:10.540
just taking a completely out of the picture and letting them find their own way.

1530
01:32:10.541 --> 01:32:11.560
It's,
it's tough.

1531
01:32:11.670 --> 01:32:15.630
<v 2>Yeah.
It's a tragedy that there's not more money and more time and more effort.</v>

1532
01:32:15.631 --> 01:32:18.960
And more consideration invested in education.
In our culture.
It's a,

1533
01:32:18.961 --> 01:32:23.910
it's one of the least paid jobs that is the most important job.

1534
01:32:24.210 --> 01:32:27.590
He find out the teachers again,
35 $45,000 a year,
man.

1535
01:32:27.830 --> 01:32:31.350
How the fuck do you live on that?
How does that,
as a human being,
you know,

1536
01:32:31.351 --> 01:32:36.351
have a family and a wife and kids on $35,000 $45,000 a year.

1537
01:32:36.481 --> 01:32:37.350
It's crazy.

1538
01:32:37.610 --> 01:32:41.970
You'd get by if you're a single man or single woman by herself on that.

1539
01:32:41.971 --> 01:32:43.020
But if you,

1540
01:32:43.050 --> 01:32:46.200
if you were like really planning for a future and you're making that kind of

1541
01:32:46.201 --> 01:32:46.471
money,

1542
01:32:46.471 --> 01:32:50.820
it's just no incentive for people that even have a love for education to get

1543
01:32:50.821 --> 01:32:51.654
involved in it.

1544
01:32:51.670 --> 01:32:54.760
<v 3>It's really,
really tough.
I mean,
and that's it.
They have to be,</v>

1545
01:32:54.880 --> 01:32:57.830
they have to be driven to one of the teachers and,
and then that's a,

1546
01:32:57.860 --> 01:33:02.230
that's got to be a small percentage of,
I mean,
you don't have to be like,

1547
01:33:02.260 --> 01:33:06.480
you know,
totally
driven like a,

1548
01:33:06.520 --> 01:33:09.730
like an artist to be a good teacher.
You know what I mean?
You can and,

1549
01:33:09.850 --> 01:33:14.820
and it cuts out a whole,
a whole lot of people that,

1550
01:33:14.890 --> 01:33:18.880
that could be good teachers and they just don't want to go that way cause they

1551
01:33:18.881 --> 01:33:21.010
don't want to have to live like they're close.

1552
01:33:21.200 --> 01:33:23.430
<v 2>Why would he lie?
You know?
It's also,</v>

1553
01:33:23.700 --> 01:33:26.750
it's just sad that they're not given as much respect.
I mean,

1554
01:33:27.130 --> 01:33:30.120
that should be an incredibly respected position.

1555
01:33:30.270 --> 01:33:32.280
You're leaving your children with them.
I got to,

1556
01:33:32.300 --> 01:33:35.550
I had a conversation with someone about this the other day that we,

1557
01:33:35.920 --> 01:33:38.130
we talk about like,
I,
you know,
I'm,

1558
01:33:38.131 --> 01:33:41.820
I'm in there to raise my kids and everybody raises your kids.
It's not just you.

1559
01:33:42.060 --> 01:33:45.270
Your kids are being raised by all the people that are going to school with you

1560
01:33:45.271 --> 01:33:47.580
mean just because you're there when your kids go to sleep,
when you're there,

1561
01:33:47.581 --> 01:33:50.220
when your kids wake up and you feed them breakfast,
your kids,

1562
01:33:50.221 --> 01:33:53.280
if they're in school,
they're being raised by other people as well.

1563
01:33:53.310 --> 01:33:57.930
They're experiencing a point of unit perspective that's not individually are

1564
01:33:57.931 --> 01:33:58.890
uniquely your own.

1565
01:33:59.560 --> 01:34:02.520
<v 3>Oh,
it's so much of it is like,
um,</v>

1566
01:34:02.840 --> 01:34:07.550
because people have to have two jobs,
you know?
Um,
and both parents working,

1567
01:34:08.060 --> 01:34:12.350
it turns out to be,
you know,
almost like a daycare thing.
You know what I mean?

1568
01:34:12.351 --> 01:34:17.230
It's like people can't afford to have a nanny or whatever and it's like the the

1569
01:34:17.231 --> 01:34:22.220
schools or are used to as a place to dump your kids off so he can go off,

1570
01:34:22.650 --> 01:34:25.490
run off to your job.
And I think that that's a,
again,

1571
01:34:25.520 --> 01:34:27.860
that's another side effect of the,

1572
01:34:27.861 --> 01:34:31.960
of the economy doing what it is and what it's doing is it's a,

1573
01:34:32.360 --> 01:34:35.350
it's working against everybody.
You know?
It's also a,

1574
01:34:35.730 --> 01:34:38.380
<v 2>a real symptom of our perspective.</v>

1575
01:34:38.530 --> 01:34:42.820
It's a symptom of our perspective being so skewed that the things that are

1576
01:34:42.821 --> 01:34:46.210
really in hugely important,
like I've talked about this before,

1577
01:34:46.211 --> 01:34:50.530
but it bears mentioning again that the most important thing,

1578
01:34:50.560 --> 01:34:52.060
if you want to have a strong country,

1579
01:34:52.061 --> 01:34:55.150
the most important thing is have less losers.

1580
01:34:55.720 --> 01:34:58.910
The more people that have educations,
more people that are happy,

1581
01:34:58.911 --> 01:35:03.010
more people that are healthy,
that would make a stronger country.
Right?
Well,
well,

1582
01:35:03.050 --> 01:35:05.810
well how come they don't invest more money in children?

1583
01:35:05.811 --> 01:35:06.920
Why don't they invest more money?

1584
01:35:06.921 --> 01:35:11.060
This government is constantly going overseas and fucking with this country and

1585
01:35:11.061 --> 01:35:15.410
invading that country and isis and this shit and that shit.

1586
01:35:15.411 --> 01:35:17.210
And that's all well and good.

1587
01:35:17.211 --> 01:35:21.560
But what about fucking children that are living right here in the places where

1588
01:35:21.561 --> 01:35:23.870
people pay taxes?
What about those children?

1589
01:35:23.871 --> 01:35:25.700
And so they didn't ask to be born poor.

1590
01:35:25.850 --> 01:35:28.960
They didn't ask to be born in some shitty town.
The,
the,

1591
01:35:28.961 --> 01:35:32.960
the fact that we don't invest more money in our infrastructure and our,
just our,

1592
01:35:33.040 --> 01:35:37.010
our human infrastructure that just the children growing up that are going to be

1593
01:35:37.011 --> 01:35:38.660
the people that you're going to have to interact with,

1594
01:35:38.810 --> 01:35:40.970
that your kids are going to have to interact with.
There's,

1595
01:35:41.020 --> 01:35:44.000
this is a way to mitigate that.
It's at least to a certain extent,

1596
01:35:44.180 --> 01:35:48.350
there's a way to make a world a little bit better and they're not doing anything

1597
01:35:48.351 --> 01:35:51.560
about it.
They're cutting,
cutting money to education,

1598
01:35:51.561 --> 01:35:55.550
cutting afterschool programs,
cutting the athletics.
I mean,

1599
01:35:55.910 --> 01:35:58.250
wrestling programs are under fire everywhere.

1600
01:35:58.570 --> 01:36:02.230
<v 3>Believable.
That's crazy.
It blows my mind when I hear that stuff.
I mean,</v>

1601
01:36:03.280 --> 01:36:07.930
you have no,
you know,
no athletics.
Uh,
I mean,
it's like,

1602
01:36:08.830 --> 01:36:10.060
I mean,
when I was growing up,
I mean,

1603
01:36:10.061 --> 01:36:13.840
all that stuff was available even in a tiny town that I grew up in.
I mean,

1604
01:36:13.841 --> 01:36:17.320
it was,
uh,
you know,
I mean,
it's just part of it,
you know?

1605
01:36:18.430 --> 01:36:23.110
<v 2>Yeah.
It's,
it's,
it's a very strange time.
We live in a very strange time.</v>

1606
01:36:23.140 --> 01:36:26.800
It's almost like we have a bunch of children that are,

1607
01:36:26.920 --> 01:36:31.210
that don't have a dad and uh,
you know,
they're lord of flying the whole country,

1608
01:36:31.240 --> 01:36:33.600
you know,
it's Lord of the flies,
but it's like the,
the,

1609
01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:38.500
the country is being run by people who are children.
It's like,
yeah,

1610
01:36:38.501 --> 01:36:40.740
there might be in their fifties.
Yeah.
They,
you know,
their,
their,

1611
01:36:40.741 --> 01:36:44.320
their perspective is so fucking goofy.
It's like,

1612
01:36:44.321 --> 01:36:48.310
what's important and what's not important is just being elected fundraising,

1613
01:36:48.520 --> 01:36:52.300
you know,
uh,
being loyal to your political party and your constituents.

1614
01:36:52.540 --> 01:36:57.540
But they're the real issue of like social engineering m in a,

1615
01:36:57.701 --> 01:37:02.020
in a sense of managing our communities in a more bountiful way.

1616
01:37:02.021 --> 01:37:04.870
Managing our communities in a more,
making them more prosperous,

1617
01:37:04.871 --> 01:37:07.440
making people healthier and more educated.
It's not,

1618
01:37:07.441 --> 01:37:09.160
not under consideration at all.

1619
01:37:09.250 --> 01:37:13.000
They pay lip service to it when they give political speeches,

1620
01:37:13.150 --> 01:37:17.730
but the reality of being a president or a senator or congressman is I'll

1621
01:37:17.800 --> 01:37:21.880
fucking,
huge amount of your time is spent raising money

1622
01:37:21.970 --> 01:37:23.710
<v 3>they don't have.
How can anybody,</v>

1623
01:37:23.770 --> 01:37:28.770
how good and how can anybody learn to learn the ropes in four years?

1624
01:37:29.710 --> 01:37:32.560
That's what I want to,
you know what I mean?
It's like,
it's set up to,

1625
01:37:32.620 --> 01:37:37.270
to just to the dynamics.
It's set up that way.
I mean,
you know,

1626
01:37:37.271 --> 01:37:40.210
and then we know that they did it because we didn't want to have a king.

1627
01:37:40.211 --> 01:37:45.010
We didn't,
they were all afraid of having a king and all that.
And they,
they,
uh,

1628
01:37:45.470 --> 01:37:49.060
you know,
I think a lot of it was,
was based on,
you know,

1629
01:37:49.180 --> 01:37:54.130
the rebellion and,
you know,
cutting our ties with thing and not having that,

1630
01:37:54.160 --> 01:37:58.740
that,
that,
uh,
that royalty saying and all that,
you know,
it just,

1631
01:37:59.550 --> 01:38:02.610
the whole,
the whole political thing.
I mean,
like when you,

1632
01:38:02.670 --> 01:38:07.590
when you go to Washington,
do you feel a different vibe?
Like when he'd get,
like,

1633
01:38:07.980 --> 01:38:12.980
when I go go to Washington DC and I go inside the beltway,

1634
01:38:13.650 --> 01:38:17.900
it's almost like I'm in a different world.
I feel this,
this different energy.

1635
01:38:17.901 --> 01:38:21.090
There's different vibe,
a total disconnect from the rest of the country.

1636
01:38:21.091 --> 01:38:22.920
It's like it's really strange.

1637
01:38:22.970 --> 01:38:27.140
<v 2>She said Onstar,
it is visiting the desktop.
It's like,
I mean that's what,</v>

1638
01:38:27.141 --> 01:38:30.230
that's what that is.
I mean I was just there.
It was just there last weekend.

1639
01:38:30.260 --> 01:38:34.760
It's the fucking death star.
That's where more political unrest,

1640
01:38:34.940 --> 01:38:38.630
more calculated attacks on foreign soil.

1641
01:38:38.660 --> 01:38:43.460
It's all taking places one and then fucking political interests and special

1642
01:38:43.461 --> 01:38:44.294
interest groups.

1643
01:38:44.360 --> 01:38:49.360
There's a county this somewhere off of a a way from Washington DC and Virginia

1644
01:38:49.940 --> 01:38:53.360
where there's more money per capita in this one area.

1645
01:38:53.361 --> 01:38:55.970
Then almost any area in the country and it's just lobbyists.

1646
01:38:56.090 --> 01:38:56.930
That's who lived there.

1647
01:38:57.220 --> 01:39:02.220
Just fucking political criminals how to just fucking up our entire system

1648
01:39:02.841 --> 01:39:04.850
through the loopholes and that's it.

1649
01:39:04.910 --> 01:39:07.580
<v 3>Ned just sitting there making,
making these decisions,</v>

1650
01:39:07.670 --> 01:39:10.910
pushing things that they don't really care about the thinking about their failed

1651
01:39:11.340 --> 01:39:14.090
and,
you know,
making sure they're going to have enough money to,

1652
01:39:14.091 --> 01:39:16.430
to like hand down to their kids or whatever,

1653
01:39:16.431 --> 01:39:21.080
and country clubs and fucking yachts and the power that it comes with that which

1654
01:39:21.081 --> 01:39:26.060
is a huge drug and uh,
and,
uh,
an ego and all that stuff.

1655
01:39:26.061 --> 01:39:29.150
And it just,
it just runs rampant there.
And it's a,

1656
01:39:29.750 --> 01:39:34.190
and they're the ones that are telling people in the Midwest how to live,
how to,

1657
01:39:34.750 --> 01:39:39.560
how to,
you know,
do everything as much as they can,
you know,

1658
01:39:39.561 --> 01:39:43.610
and it's just getting more worse and worse,
you know,
I mean,
uh,
but anyway,

1659
01:39:43.611 --> 01:39:48.170
I think people should stand up and,
and Jesus,
I mean,
you know,

1660
01:39:48.680 --> 01:39:51.560
even the voting thing,
I'm starting to think about,
you know,
I mean,

1661
01:39:51.561 --> 01:39:56.360
I w I didn't vote in,
you know,
in the 70s,
didn't really do much,
but,

1662
01:39:57.110 --> 01:39:57.943
you know,

1663
01:39:58.400 --> 01:40:01.940
worked for the work with the band to try and make it what it was and all that.

1664
01:40:01.941 --> 01:40:06.530
But you know,
when I started,
uh,
you know,
thinking,
thinking a little clearer,

1665
01:40:06.531 --> 01:40:10.220
I started voting,
but now I'm starting to wonder about the whole thing.
I mean,

1666
01:40:10.250 --> 01:40:13.020
you know,
people that say,
you know,
hey look,
you're,

1667
01:40:13.021 --> 01:40:16.250
you're making a statement by not,
but I don't know if that's true.

1668
01:40:17.010 --> 01:40:21.050
<v 2>It's,
it's rigged where you're not doing anything.
If you don't,</v>

1669
01:40:21.230 --> 01:40:25.010
you're not doing anything.
If you do,
it's,
it's a two party system.

1670
01:40:25.220 --> 01:40:28.400
And if you look at this two party system,
how manipulated it is.

1671
01:40:28.580 --> 01:40:32.570
If you look at the commission for presidential debates,
you look at how this,

1672
01:40:32.571 --> 01:40:36.950
this,
this group has set it up so that the people that are allowed to debate,

1673
01:40:37.160 --> 01:40:39.440
like when it gets down to it,
it's you have to have a,

1674
01:40:39.441 --> 01:40:41.540
a percentage of the popular vote.

1675
01:40:41.840 --> 01:40:46.840
You know in these people that are mainstream folks like Obama and Mccain and

1676
01:40:48.621 --> 01:40:50.660
they're going to be able to debate and they're going to be able to be,

1677
01:40:50.810 --> 01:40:52.160
but the Weirdos,

1678
01:40:52.400 --> 01:40:57.400
you know the green in the people with like strange ideas that are are what,

1679
01:40:58.100 --> 01:40:59.680
what's considered non traditional.

1680
01:40:59.860 --> 01:41:04.780
They don't get a say and that that's,
that's kind of fucked up.

1681
01:41:04.810 --> 01:41:05.710
I mean if we're,

1682
01:41:05.740 --> 01:41:10.660
if we're going to have like a real even society where all sorts of different

1683
01:41:10.661 --> 01:41:11.950
ideas that get considered,

1684
01:41:12.130 --> 01:41:15.790
we can't say that this thing's perfect the way this thing is right now.

1685
01:41:15.791 --> 01:41:16.900
It's not perfect.
Every,

1686
01:41:17.080 --> 01:41:19.240
everybody will live admitted even from the top to the bottom.

1687
01:41:19.241 --> 01:41:21.710
They will admit it's not perfect.
There's a lot of problems with,

1688
01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:24.070
with our culture and our,
the way we run things,

1689
01:41:24.340 --> 01:41:28.540
but they don't take into consideration other people's ideas.
They just,

1690
01:41:28.570 --> 01:41:32.260
they won't allow them because Ross Perot fucked all that shit up.

1691
01:41:32.490 --> 01:41:35.330
Ross Perot came in and he,
I believe he only had,

1692
01:41:35.530 --> 01:41:40.530
you only had to have like 5% of the vote in the primaries in order to be

1693
01:41:41.891 --> 01:41:44.980
considered a for these presidential elections.

1694
01:41:44.981 --> 01:41:49.190
So you got this crazy billionaire who,
if you remember the Ross Perot days,
yeah,

1695
01:41:49.220 --> 01:41:53.770
sure.
That's the reason why George Bush's Dad,
Herbert Walker Bush,
the big guy,

1696
01:41:53.980 --> 01:41:56.110
that's why he didn't win a second term.

1697
01:41:56.140 --> 01:42:00.070
Ross Perot came in and stole a bunch of the votes Clinton snuck in.

1698
01:42:00.240 --> 01:42:02.820
<v 3>Yup.
Yeah.
I mean it's just,
uh,</v>

1699
01:42:03.660 --> 01:42:07.350
it's just the whole,
the whole mechanics of the whole thing,
just,

1700
01:42:08.040 --> 01:42:11.310
it's almost like we're standing on the outside watching this thing happened

1701
01:42:11.311 --> 01:42:15.420
inside of us,
this giant fishbowl.
But it all radiates out to,

1702
01:42:15.500 --> 01:42:17.610
to fuck us all up.
You know?

1703
01:42:17.740 --> 01:42:22.740
<v 2>It's also how do you stop the momentum of this gigantic machine and reorganize</v>

1704
01:42:23.621 --> 01:42:25.810
the whole thing in a way that everybody agrees to,

1705
01:42:26.020 --> 01:42:29.980
especially everybody who has already been profiting for so long off of the

1706
01:42:29.981 --> 01:42:30.910
current situation.

1707
01:42:31.330 --> 01:42:35.140
And you're dealing with corporations that have a massive amount of influence and

1708
01:42:35.141 --> 01:42:38.980
you would have to somehow now another strip away the rights of the Supreme

1709
01:42:38.980 --> 01:42:43.960
Court's given them to give as much fucking money as they want to kick candidates

1710
01:42:43.961 --> 01:42:48.520
and to act as individuals that it's crazy.
It's crazy.

1711
01:42:48.521 --> 01:42:50.630
So to stop that like boy you're deal,

1712
01:42:50.631 --> 01:42:53.500
you got a runaway train and you're asking someone to stand in front of it and

1713
01:42:53.501 --> 01:42:56.380
put their hands up and try to stop that fucking thing.
It's like,

1714
01:42:56.410 --> 01:42:58.510
I don't think it's a perfect situation.

1715
01:42:58.511 --> 01:43:03.511
I think for sure someone could do a way better job of engineering our society

1716
01:43:03.970 --> 01:43:07.390
and how we run,
how we establish laws,

1717
01:43:07.540 --> 01:43:11.570
how we take away,
take taxes and you know,

1718
01:43:11.740 --> 01:43:15.280
relegate them to areas of society that we deem necessary.

1719
01:43:15.281 --> 01:43:17.110
Whether it's law enforcement or you know,

1720
01:43:17.111 --> 01:43:20.620
fire protection or whatever it is that we need money far from,

1721
01:43:20.650 --> 01:43:23.860
from taxes to do that in a more ethical way,

1722
01:43:23.861 --> 01:43:27.870
in a way that's more mutually beneficial.
I think it's possible,
but it's,

1723
01:43:27.871 --> 01:43:28.051
you know,

1724
01:43:28.051 --> 01:43:33.010
it would have to stop this fucking massive machine with so much momentum behind

1725
01:43:33.011 --> 01:43:34.810
it.
And that's the real difficult culty.

1726
01:43:34.970 --> 01:43:38.210
<v 3>And I think that the,
the,
the,
the people that could do the job,</v>

1727
01:43:38.270 --> 01:43:42.940
the s the people that are really smart and,
and no,
no,
the guts of,

1728
01:43:42.950 --> 01:43:45.230
of the politics and playing the game,

1729
01:43:45.840 --> 01:43:48.520
or they're just this smart enough to,
they,

1730
01:43:48.570 --> 01:43:53.480
they value their own lives more.
They go,
I just don't want to play that.

1731
01:43:53.481 --> 01:43:57.590
So I'm,
I'm handed in my autobiography,
I'll see you later.

1732
01:43:58.040 --> 01:44:01.220
You know,
I'm going to just take,
you know,

1733
01:44:01.221 --> 01:44:03.710
and we've seen,

1734
01:44:03.740 --> 01:44:07.940
we've seen candidates that look good all down the line,

1735
01:44:07.941 --> 01:44:11.540
but they just didn't have the,
the,
the charisma,

1736
01:44:11.541 --> 01:44:15.890
the bones and Yale and all that stuff or whatever,
you know,
all that stuff,

1737
01:44:15.891 --> 01:44:19.760
all that,
uh,
the credentials,
so to speak,
that,
uh,

1738
01:44:20.160 --> 01:44:22.540
you got to have to get there or enough,
uh,

1739
01:44:22.541 --> 01:44:27.530
of the lobbyists behind them that they know they can be bought and sold,

1740
01:44:27.560 --> 01:44:31.700
you know,
whatever.
And so it's just,
uh,
it's,
it's,
it's,

1741
01:44:31.760 --> 01:44:34.850
it is a big machine and it's,
and it's running by itself.

1742
01:44:35.210 --> 01:44:38.330
And that's why I feel that it's just vibe.
You know,

1743
01:44:38.331 --> 01:44:43.250
there's so much money in so much power going on inside that beltway.
It's like,

1744
01:44:43.670 --> 01:44:47.050
I don't know,
it's creepy.
Can't relate to that and know what I mean.
It is,

1745
01:44:47.790 --> 01:44:47.971
<v 2>well,</v>

1746
01:44:47.971 --> 01:44:52.971
it's weird to the haves and have nots and DC are so apparent because DC is

1747
01:44:53.611 --> 01:44:58.230
bordering,
I mean there's,
there's all this money and there's always white people,

1748
01:44:58.500 --> 01:45:02.640
but then there's this impoverished black community that's outside of it that

1749
01:45:02.641 --> 01:45:06.450
elected fucking Marion Barry twice as mayor.

1750
01:45:06.700 --> 01:45:10.470
They elected him as mayor after he got arrested for smoking crack.

1751
01:45:10.890 --> 01:45:15.210
They elected him again.
I mean,
it's a fucking wild town.

1752
01:45:15.300 --> 01:45:18.900
It's a wild town on the outskirts of the death star.

1753
01:45:19.130 --> 01:45:23.210
<v 3>Oh yeah.
I mean,
walk,
walked down that street and Georgetown,</v>

1754
01:45:23.211 --> 01:45:27.560
you know what the main drag there and I don't feel safe there day or night,

1755
01:45:28.070 --> 01:45:30.800
you know what I mean?
It just,
I mean,
one time we'd get,

1756
01:45:30.801 --> 01:45:34.790
we'd been there and they've just been a huge shooting right there in the

1757
01:45:34.791 --> 01:45:39.260
Starbucks,
you know what I mean?
And it just like,
you know,
it's just,

1758
01:45:39.290 --> 01:45:41.390
it's just crazy.
And,
uh,

1759
01:45:41.550 --> 01:45:43.920
<v 2>wasn't it the murder capital of the country at one point?</v>

1760
01:45:44.080 --> 01:45:48.110
<v 3>Yeah,
I think it was.
I mean,
uh,
there were,
there were,
you know,
they were,</v>

1761
01:45:48.130 --> 01:45:51.790
they were in competition with Detroit and whatever.
I don't know,
somewhere else.

1762
01:45:51.840 --> 01:45:55.690
The Superbowl of bounces around from city to city,
you know,
it was like a,

1763
01:45:55.750 --> 01:45:58.940
you know,
selling more glocks per,
per,
per,

1764
01:45:59.290 --> 01:46:02.950
per person than any other place in the,
in the world,
you know?

1765
01:46:03.760 --> 01:46:08.040
Unbelievable.
Yeah.
It's very strange,
very strange.
But it's also,
it's a,

1766
01:46:08.050 --> 01:46:12.410
it's almost a perfect representation of our country itself.
Yeah.

1767
01:46:12.790 --> 01:46:14.410
How fucking weird our country itself.

1768
01:46:15.080 --> 01:46:18.220
Let's talk about that thing you got in your,
in your front there.

1769
01:46:18.221 --> 01:46:22.540
That's where all that is so cool.
I mean,
I,
I mean it's like,
uh,

1770
01:46:23.050 --> 01:46:26.800
I could see something like that leaping out of the woods.
I really,
I mean,

1771
01:46:26.801 --> 01:46:31.210
I mean I'm,
I'm,
until I,
til somebody could prove it,
prove it different.

1772
01:46:31.211 --> 01:46:36.040
I believe that some of those animals are out there.
I mean,
and so,
I mean,

1773
01:46:36.041 --> 01:46:38.710
it's just,
it's the right size,
you know what I mean?

1774
01:46:38.711 --> 01:46:42.280
The right weight and all that.
It's just a matter of if it can find enough food,

1775
01:46:42.340 --> 01:46:44.050
you know?
Well,
there's tigers.

1776
01:46:44.140 --> 01:46:46.840
Tigers are a lot fucking scary then a werewolf cause the tigers,

1777
01:46:46.841 --> 01:46:50.040
the tiger 24 hours a day,
seven days a week where we'll

1778
01:46:50.040 --> 01:46:52.830
<v 0>falling becomes a murdering machine when the full moon is out.</v>

1779
01:46:52.940 --> 01:46:57.680
<v 3>Right,
right.
But that one that's,
hey,
that's what it would look like.</v>

1780
01:46:57.770 --> 01:47:01.640
<v 0>Yeah.
Well that could really be an animal for sure.
That could be an animal.</v>

1781
01:47:01.760 --> 01:47:04.560
I mean,
it's not much different than a wolf.
I mean,
it was just a little,

1782
01:47:04.561 --> 01:47:08.450
just a lot bigger.
Yeah.
Yeah.
If,
if an animal,
if you,

1783
01:47:08.451 --> 01:47:09.800
if you really want to think about it,

1784
01:47:09.801 --> 01:47:12.890
there's a lot of animals that people get fixated on like a,

1785
01:47:12.900 --> 01:47:16.850
there's like vampires.
People are terrified of vampires.
Vampires are scary.

1786
01:47:16.851 --> 01:47:19.550
But how's the vampire?
Any more scary than a bola?

1787
01:47:20.130 --> 01:47:24.410
Bola is easily as scary as a fucking vampire vampire.

1788
01:47:24.411 --> 01:47:27.620
He drive a stake through its heart and you're done.
It's good.
You know,

1789
01:47:27.970 --> 01:47:30.930
we know Werewolf,
you shoot it with a silver bullet.
You're out of there.

1790
01:47:31.830 --> 01:47:34.070
Lone ranger had the right idea.
He did.

1791
01:47:34.550 --> 01:47:39.210
<v 3>No,
it always leaves.
It leaves a leave the,
you know,</v>

1792
01:47:39.240 --> 01:47:42.980
the heroin or the hero with the,
I don't know

1793
01:47:43.020 --> 01:47:45.570
<v 0>whose name was,
but he left me the silver bullet.
You know,</v>

1794
01:47:45.780 --> 01:47:47.390
maybe even the lone ranger was a wearable hunter.

1795
01:47:47.400 --> 01:47:50.100
Why haven't they made that movie?
Lone ranger,
the Werewolf that,

1796
01:47:50.360 --> 01:47:54.510
that seems like a perfect,
that seems like a perfect connection there.

1797
01:47:54.720 --> 01:47:57.390
I like that.
But that thing was made by this guy named Pat Mcgee,

1798
01:47:57.391 --> 01:47:58.920
who's a special effects designer.

1799
01:47:58.921 --> 01:48:03.120
He does movies and all sorts of shit and the model of the American Werewolf in

1800
01:48:03.121 --> 01:48:06.840
London,
real hair on it and everything.
I wonder if it's,

1801
01:48:06.841 --> 01:48:11.730
I think it's Yak hair or some shit.
Well,
he told us.
I forgot to add this.

1802
01:48:12.960 --> 01:48:16.020
What does it have to do with Triflin?
That's disgusting.
Having Yak and Ted Yak.

1803
01:48:16.021 --> 01:48:17.770
Heroin.
Why?
I don't know.
That's great.

1804
01:48:17.910 --> 01:48:21.510
Well if you're gonna I don't think they can make fake hair that looked anything

1805
01:48:21.511 --> 01:48:23.550
like really are.
That's why two pays a quick shit.

1806
01:48:23.600 --> 01:48:26.850
You ever been with a girl that has fake hair and ascension?
Yeah,

1807
01:48:27.360 --> 01:48:31.170
I think that's just disgusting to think like who's hair that is,

1808
01:48:31.171 --> 01:48:34.560
is that person alive?
Did they love is a outsourced,

1809
01:48:34.590 --> 01:48:39.260
just like we were talking about jobs,
a lot of it's from India.
Yeah.
The,
they,

1810
01:48:40.510 --> 01:48:43.680
they grow it and it has to be a certain length and then they can cut it,

1811
01:48:43.700 --> 01:48:47.600
outsource it or watching a frozen.

1812
01:48:47.620 --> 01:48:50.520
And my daughter loves that movie frozen and uh,
she can read now.

1813
01:48:50.521 --> 01:48:54.470
So she likes to wait for the credits and then read people's names and uh,

1814
01:48:54.810 --> 01:48:58.590
they're all Indian names,
like the people who made the movie because it's,
uh,

1815
01:48:58.600 --> 01:49:02.100
they,
they just fucking outsource all the animation.
So all of it was India.

1816
01:49:02.440 --> 01:49:05.420
Like there are all these palm [inaudible],
you know,

1817
01:49:05.421 --> 01:49:08.010
like all these crazy names that you have a really hard time pronouncing.

1818
01:49:08.640 --> 01:49:13.140
<v 3>Wow.
Well,
Hey,
they get it done.
I mean,
I know that,
you know,</v>

1819
01:49:13.141 --> 01:49:17.120
like a lot of the cartoons just,
they do,
they um,
uh,
you know,
they,
they,

1820
01:49:17.190 --> 01:49:20.910
they do like the cornerstone pictures of what,
you know,

1821
01:49:20.911 --> 01:49:22.200
with the cartoons is going to be in,

1822
01:49:22.201 --> 01:49:25.590
then they send it off to career or wherever and they,

1823
01:49:25.620 --> 01:49:30.210
that's where they actually do the,
the,
the,
you know,
frame by frame,

1824
01:49:30.240 --> 01:49:32.520
you know,
cartoon stuff.
I Dunno how they,

1825
01:49:32.640 --> 01:49:35.250
I mean that was when we were on the Simpsons.

1826
01:49:35.430 --> 01:49:39.210
I don't know what they do now because the computers have come some so much

1827
01:49:39.211 --> 01:49:43.800
father,
you know,
the enemy is a lot easier to do.
But back then it was like,

1828
01:49:43.830 --> 01:49:48.310
you know,
when we found out how they did it,
it was kind of like really,

1829
01:49:48.400 --> 01:49:52.180
<v 1>you know,
I mean,
it isn't like the old days when,
you know,</v>

1830
01:49:52.181 --> 01:49:55.450
you had a bunch of crazies down there and does it on the lot of Disney who

1831
01:49:55.451 --> 01:49:57.380
actually would drawing the stuff,
you know,

1832
01:49:58.270 --> 01:50:02.680
had political stuff that related to the war to the country.
I mean,
it was really,

1833
01:50:03.040 --> 01:50:06.300
you looked at some of those old cartoons and they're great because they're this,

1834
01:50:06.430 --> 01:50:08.680
they're saying so much in there,
you know,

1835
01:50:08.770 --> 01:50:12.670
and because it was guys that live right down the street and that actually did

1836
01:50:12.671 --> 01:50:14.590
the work,
instead of,
you know,

1837
01:50:14.620 --> 01:50:17.740
somebody off and if they go off the line or out of the thing,

1838
01:50:17.741 --> 01:50:20.980
it just gets tossed out.
And you know,
it's,
it's,

1839
01:50:21.880 --> 01:50:23.730
it's a whole different thing.
But,
uh,

1840
01:50:24.100 --> 01:50:28.330
that's why some of those old cartoons was so,
uh,
so cool to watch.
I mean,

1841
01:50:28.570 --> 01:50:32.280
some of them aren't exactly politically correct.
Some little pretty fucked,
but,

1842
01:50:33.430 --> 01:50:37.780
but you know,
some of the other things that are in there for dia,
I mean,
you know,

1843
01:50:37.810 --> 01:50:42.730
they're,
they're,
you know,
illusions to Mary Jane and,
uh,

1844
01:50:42.790 --> 01:50:45.700
you know,
the different drugs and shit.
It's pretty,
pretty funny.

1845
01:50:45.740 --> 01:50:47.710
<v 2>You know,
it is,
and it's,</v>

1846
01:50:47.720 --> 01:50:50.720
it's interesting that you're still allowed to watch those,

1847
01:50:50.721 --> 01:50:54.290
but they could never make those today.
Like Tom and Jerry.
Right.

1848
01:50:54.500 --> 01:50:57.780
Like Tom and Jerry will beat the fuck out of each other.
Yeah.

1849
01:50:58.070 --> 01:51:00.110
Like you can never have that today.

1850
01:51:00.111 --> 01:51:03.770
Tom and Jerry would hit each other with fucking frying pans and their head would

1851
01:51:03.771 --> 01:51:06.620
form and the shape of a frying pan and then they would,

1852
01:51:07.640 --> 01:51:09.980
you can't do that with kids today.
You can't have,

1853
01:51:10.070 --> 01:51:13.590
cause then some kid hits his fucking brother in the head with a frying pan

1854
01:51:13.591 --> 01:51:17.300
because he thinks it's going to turn it to the shape of a pan,
kills his brother.

1855
01:51:17.301 --> 01:51:20.270
And then they soon as Warner brothers and the next thing you know,

1856
01:51:20.300 --> 01:51:24.170
it's a class action suit,
but you're allowed to show the old ones.
It's weird.

1857
01:51:24.540 --> 01:51:25.373
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1858
01:51:25.410 --> 01:51:30.000
I read a science fiction book a while ago and it was all about,

1859
01:51:30.200 --> 01:51:34.320
um,
this,
this,
I can't remember what the plot was,

1860
01:51:34.321 --> 01:51:35.550
but the thing was,

1861
01:51:35.551 --> 01:51:40.551
the guy's job was actually going through old movies and taking out the

1862
01:51:40.771 --> 01:51:44.100
cigarette,
smoking all the,
all the,
you know,

1863
01:51:44.101 --> 01:51:47.100
whether it was TV shows or movies.
I mean,

1864
01:51:47.101 --> 01:51:51.850
his Gig was to make it look like they weren't smoking,
you know,
and it,
you know,

1865
01:51:51.851 --> 01:51:54.960
if he had to cut a couple of scenes out,
he would do that.
But mostly it was like,

1866
01:51:55.320 --> 01:51:59.070
uh,
like airbrushing or whatever,
you know,
they,
they,
they do.
And,

1867
01:51:59.130 --> 01:52:02.790
and taking cigarette smoking out of the movies,
you know.

1868
01:52:03.990 --> 01:52:08.790
Anyway,
it was something that was a,
just a little part of the feature of the,

1869
01:52:08.791 --> 01:52:13.110
of the book.
But it kind of stuck with me,
you know,
that kind of thing about,

1870
01:52:13.550 --> 01:52:16.750
it's kind of like what I call Russian history,
you know,
it's like,
you know,

1871
01:52:17.130 --> 01:52:21.660
when somebody new comes into power,
they changed the history books,
you know,

1872
01:52:21.661 --> 01:52:25.020
in Russia.
You know,
it's like they totally rewrite everything,
you know.

1873
01:52:25.090 --> 01:52:26.410
<v 2>Well,
when you go to Disneyland,</v>

1874
01:52:26.411 --> 01:52:31.300
a big percentage of the photos of Walt Disney have the cigarettes airbrushed out

1875
01:52:31.301 --> 01:52:34.000
of them.
They have photo shopped out all of his cigarettes.

1876
01:52:34.200 --> 01:52:39.130
Cause Walt Disney everywhere he went.
Tom and Jerry cartoons carry racism on it.

1877
01:52:39.131 --> 01:52:41.530
Oh yeah.
Tweeted this the other day.
Yeah.

1878
01:52:41.740 --> 01:52:45.710
It's now they're making them put fucking warnings on Tom and Jerry.

1879
01:52:45.890 --> 01:52:47.600
What was racist about Tom and Jerry?

1880
01:52:47.620 --> 01:52:50.890
<v 1>I named Murray,
who is the woman that would walk around.</v>

1881
01:52:50.920 --> 01:52:53.620
It was like the maid or she's like,
oh Tom.

1882
01:52:54.650 --> 01:52:58.040
<v 2>Right.
He's a racist if that person actually exists.</v>

1883
01:52:58.920 --> 01:53:02.720
If you could show a person like that,
is it racist?
Like how about this?

1884
01:53:02.960 --> 01:53:07.960
If you show a fucking toothless old cracker from Kentucky,

1885
01:53:08.780 --> 01:53:12.140
is that racist?
Because that's a real dude.
Like there's a lot of dudes.

1886
01:53:12.141 --> 01:53:15.560
If you go to West Virginia,
okay,
well you go into the mountains,

1887
01:53:15.680 --> 01:53:20.540
you'll find some fucking rednecky motherfuckers and they're real people.

1888
01:53:20.830 --> 01:53:24.590
And if you put them on a cartoon,
would that be racist?
No.

1889
01:53:24.591 --> 01:53:26.030
Cause look at honey booboo,
right?

1890
01:53:26.090 --> 01:53:29.270
So if you have some aunt Jemima looking old fat black lady,

1891
01:53:29.450 --> 01:53:31.400
if I could show you a real version of that,

1892
01:53:31.401 --> 01:53:36.401
is that racist or is it racial or is it representative of a small percentage of

1893
01:53:36.741 --> 01:53:39.500
people who happen to be African American?
How's that racist?

1894
01:53:40.250 --> 01:53:43.580
<v 1>I don't know.
But there's also points in like Tom and Jerry were like,</v>

1895
01:53:43.581 --> 01:53:48.140
you know like I cigar blows up or,
and he has black face,
you know,
type things.

1896
01:53:48.141 --> 01:53:52.130
There's like a bunch of weird little things that as a kid growing up we were

1897
01:53:52.131 --> 01:53:54.050
just like,
that's hilarious.
He's a black face.

1898
01:53:54.051 --> 01:53:58.860
But when I said make it black face or did you just have sweat on his face that

1899
01:53:58.861 --> 01:54:01.310
makes that face,
you know,
but that's,

1900
01:54:01.340 --> 01:54:06.260
that's the where somebody's going to go get rid of that,
you know.

1901
01:54:06.660 --> 01:54:08.820
<v 2>Well the,
the photos of Walt Disney,
a real weird,</v>

1902
01:54:08.821 --> 01:54:13.260
I've got a few of them on my Instagram last time I was there because you see him

1903
01:54:13.530 --> 01:54:16.560
sitting there like this.
Like he would have,
you know,

1904
01:54:16.561 --> 01:54:19.380
his fingers are in a position where he would have a cigarette in his hand and

1905
01:54:19.390 --> 01:54:24.390
chose the cigarettes missing cause apparently released a chain smoker and died

1906
01:54:24.391 --> 01:54:28.140
of,
you know,
of dizzy complications because of a lung disease.

1907
01:54:28.640 --> 01:54:30.840
And that's what he died from.
But they tried to hide that too.

1908
01:54:30.841 --> 01:54:34.980
They tried to like doctor up is uh,
but they sort of freely admit it.
Now.

1909
01:54:34.981 --> 01:54:37.800
We went on a tour like last time we were at Disneyland and one of the people

1910
01:54:37.801 --> 01:54:41.580
that really understands like the history of Disney,
it's pretty fascinating.

1911
01:54:41.770 --> 01:54:44.730
It took us and showed us all the images and explained to us,

1912
01:54:45.250 --> 01:54:46.660
<v 1>did they ever show you the,
uh,</v>

1913
01:54:46.661 --> 01:54:51.661
the supposed to be a really fancy restaurant like down underneath for guests and

1914
01:54:52.451 --> 01:54:56.090
for VIP days and it's behind one of the door,
one,

1915
01:54:56.140 --> 01:55:00.430
one of the doors in one of the,
one of the fake,
um,
uh,

1916
01:55:00.460 --> 01:55:05.120
streets,
uh,
really you can go down and you walk down and it apparently it's like,

1917
01:55:05.710 --> 01:55:09.030
like everything's Tiffany lamps from the,
from the 20s and,

1918
01:55:09.290 --> 01:55:13.300
and all that kind of stuff.
And it's supposed to be like gourmet restaurant.

1919
01:55:13.780 --> 01:55:15.580
I've never been in there.
I just heard stories.

1920
01:55:16.180 --> 01:55:20.080
What's the ride where you can go through and then you can eat inside the ride.

1921
01:55:20.290 --> 01:55:24.560
It's a small world or pirates of the Caribbean,
the Caribbean,
but it's,
uh,

1922
01:55:24.600 --> 01:55:28.180
overlook the,
that,
that restaurants overlooking that.
So if you're,

1923
01:55:28.181 --> 01:55:30.730
if you're sitting in there,
you'll see like this house,

1924
01:55:30.910 --> 01:55:34.020
that's actually the restaurant he was talking about,
I forget.

1925
01:55:34.021 --> 01:55:36.130
It's like waltz,

1926
01:55:36.340 --> 01:55:39.410
you have to have a secret password or something like that to get in it.

1927
01:55:39.970 --> 01:55:44.400
There's so many hidden secrets of Disneyland that I know that like if you go to

1928
01:55:44.850 --> 01:55:45.970
the haunted house,
right?

1929
01:55:46.060 --> 01:55:48.720
If you ask for a death certificate at the end of the ride,

1930
01:55:48.721 --> 01:55:52.890
they'll give you a death certificate or all the people sweeping up that walk

1931
01:55:52.891 --> 01:55:55.800
around.
They all carried these pins,
these collectible pins,

1932
01:55:55.801 --> 01:55:58.740
and they will give them to you.
If you ask her,
is it like a million things,

1933
01:55:58.741 --> 01:55:59.220
but Joe

1934
01:55:59.220 --> 01:55:59.490
<v 2>check the,</v>

1935
01:55:59.490 --> 01:56:04.490
it's called club 33 and it's a Disneyland's secret $25,000 dining club.

1936
01:56:07.140 --> 01:56:07.920
Wow.

1937
01:56:07.920 --> 01:56:12.920
$25,000 for what is is like for a membership with the fuck is a 25 grand for,

1938
01:56:14.080 --> 01:56:17.950
<v 1>I didn't even know that you could get in there unless you knew somebody.
Yeah.</v>

1939
01:56:18.070 --> 01:56:21.670
<v 2>The main menu is full of upscale options among them.</v>

1940
01:56:21.700 --> 01:56:24.610
A King crab stuffed lobster tail Pan,

1941
01:56:24.611 --> 01:56:29.380
roasted Philemon own chipolte lay salted Holland day king salmon,

1942
01:56:29.410 --> 01:56:32.170
Colorado lamb chops.
When there's more menudo in there,

1943
01:56:34.420 --> 01:56:36.460
it says,
listen to this.

1944
01:56:36.670 --> 01:56:40.690
Applicants can be on hold for about 14 years,

1945
01:56:40.930 --> 01:56:45.930
just for the chance to pay the $25,000 initiation fee within the additional

1946
01:56:46.840 --> 01:56:49.660
$10,000 annual membership fee.

1947
01:56:50.080 --> 01:56:54.250
Applicant's must also pass a rigorous background check.
Well,

1948
01:56:54.400 --> 01:56:57.680
good luck with that.
I'm out.
It didn't make the cut rigorous

1949
01:56:57.950 --> 01:57:01.970
<v 1>background check or is that,
what does that mean?
You have to be white,</v>

1950
01:57:04.300 --> 01:57:08.420
which you pay as a start.
I mean it's probably at the top of the list,
but wow,

1951
01:57:08.421 --> 01:57:12.650
this is fascinating.
So it's called club 33 so this would be cooked well.

1952
01:57:12.800 --> 01:57:13.401
People would lie.

1953
01:57:13.401 --> 01:57:15.890
I was saying it'd be cool if we could take phone calls and someone was a member

1954
01:57:15.891 --> 01:57:20.650
of club 33 calls at least eaten there.
We'd have to get,
yeah,

1955
01:57:21.050 --> 01:57:25.060
but anyway,
I'd never been there.
Here's what I mean.

1956
01:57:25.070 --> 01:57:28.430
We didn't even get on Saturday night live in the 70s why is that?

1957
01:57:29.250 --> 01:57:32.390
I'm not sure.
I just never,
you know,

1958
01:57:32.391 --> 01:57:34.760
it's one of those things I look back and I go,
wait a second.

1959
01:57:34.761 --> 01:57:39.560
They had all kinds of rock bands on there and we never were asked are allowed or

1960
01:57:39.800 --> 01:57:43.880
we might have been asked in our management might Alex said nobody making too

1961
01:57:43.881 --> 01:57:48.070
much money tonight and it a RFK stadium or um,

1962
01:57:48.710 --> 01:57:52.730
we were also considered,
uh,
uh,
very,
uh,
um,

1963
01:57:53.420 --> 01:57:57.450
like loose cannons,
shoo,
you know,
as far as ability,

1964
01:57:57.910 --> 01:58:00.470
uh,
you might,
we're not,

1965
01:58:00.530 --> 01:58:03.600
we weren't the band that you invited home to dinner that,

1966
01:58:03.601 --> 01:58:05.850
where you guys were too wild.
And uh,
that's,

1967
01:58:05.851 --> 01:58:08.090
I think that was one of the reasons that the,

1968
01:58:08.120 --> 01:58:11.730
that our management didn't let us go to Europe that often.

1969
01:58:11.890 --> 01:58:15.810
I think they were afraid that we would get caught at the border,

1970
01:58:17.130 --> 01:58:21.560
which was stupid because I mean we were,
we weren't that,
that out of control,

1971
01:58:21.561 --> 01:58:22.670
you know,
I think that they just,

1972
01:58:23.380 --> 01:58:28.380
we just were making too much money here and it wasn't a bother to go,

1973
01:58:29.090 --> 01:58:33.590
you know,
when you go to England and Europe and build,
build a following there.

1974
01:58:33.890 --> 01:58:38.630
Cause the few times we went,
I mean it was,
it was definitely good.
It was great.

1975
01:58:38.631 --> 01:58:43.180
And we wanted to go,
I mean,
Banzel we'll plan,
they'll go into Australia,
Japan,

1976
01:58:43.520 --> 01:58:47.560
and we may want to Japan twice.
And we went to Europe twice and I was it.

1977
01:58:47.950 --> 01:58:49.720
And there were other bands that were just,

1978
01:58:49.810 --> 01:58:54.170
it was like they would go around the world,
you know,
I mean,
and uh,
um,

1979
01:58:54.520 --> 01:58:59.140
certainly they didn't go to South America the way they do now,
but,
uh,
but,
uh,

1980
01:58:59.230 --> 01:59:03.630
they,
they just kind of kept us in,
you know,
kind of here almost a,
that,

1981
01:59:03.660 --> 01:59:08.080
that Elvis thing,
you know,
I didn't,
I mean,
we would,

1982
01:59:08.081 --> 01:59:11.900
we would ask and then they would say,
well,
maybe next year,

1983
01:59:12.130 --> 01:59:15.730
whatever time to do another album and we would do it.
So

1984
01:59:16.160 --> 01:59:18.460
<v 2>the whole world is more,
it's this,</v>

1985
01:59:18.540 --> 01:59:23.240
there's so many more options now for bands to travel and they're everywhere on

1986
01:59:23.420 --> 01:59:26.920
the Internet because people find out about you everywhere now.
They have a,

1987
01:59:26.950 --> 01:59:29.070
a song that people like,
I mean,
and,

1988
01:59:29.120 --> 01:59:33.470
and also people find out about bands from older generations.

1989
01:59:33.471 --> 01:59:35.930
They find out about them now and they become more popular because of the

1990
01:59:35.931 --> 01:59:36.800
Internet as well,
right?

1991
01:59:36.940 --> 01:59:40.570
<v 1>Oh yeah,
it's definitely opened up.
I think there were a lot of,</v>

1992
01:59:40.600 --> 01:59:45.600
a lot of advantages to the way things are now for the artists and for the fence.

1993
01:59:45.800 --> 01:59:49.650
Um,
as far as like the art moving from,
from,

1994
01:59:49.900 --> 01:59:52.060
from one place to the other and you know,
uh,

1995
01:59:52.480 --> 01:59:57.160
from one set of headphones to the next,
but certainly not getting paid.
Um,
yeah,

1996
01:59:57.161 --> 01:59:59.890
that's stars.
As far as the royalties,
I mean,
it's

1997
02:00:00.710 --> 02:00:02.950
<v 2>digital music.
What's your take on this whole when,</v>

1998
02:00:02.951 --> 02:00:06.830
when Napster came along and now with all the bit torrenting and everything?

1999
02:00:06.930 --> 02:00:10.410
<v 1>Well,
I've been a fan first,</v>

2000
02:00:10.500 --> 02:00:14.940
so when Nafta came on I was like,
I loved it because,

2001
02:00:15.680 --> 02:00:19.410
uh,
just to name one,
it,
one reason,
I mean my kids would ask me,

2002
02:00:19.420 --> 02:00:23.670
they hit to have some of the other cool songs from back in the day,
you know,

2003
02:00:23.671 --> 02:00:26.820
I mean,
they knew about led Zeppelin and the stones and all that stuff,

2004
02:00:26.821 --> 02:00:29.610
but they were there a lot,
a lot of cool bands from then.

2005
02:00:29.611 --> 02:00:33.920
And you could go on Napster and find him.
He didn't have to go to,
to,
you know,

2006
02:00:34.110 --> 02:00:38.310
skippy white's record store and,
uh,
fuck.
Anyway,
in order,

2007
02:00:38.311 --> 02:00:42.330
those kinds of things.
And you know what I mean?
And uh,
but you know,

2008
02:00:42.340 --> 02:00:44.970
at the same time I would say,
hey,
listen,
you know,

2009
02:00:45.150 --> 02:00:49.170
you're getting this for free and basically it's wrong and you know,

2010
02:00:49.710 --> 02:00:53.910
that's part of your inheritance that you're losing right now by us doing this,

2011
02:00:53.940 --> 02:00:57.570
you know,
and,
you know,
so they would,
they would make an effort to,
like,

2012
02:00:57.571 --> 02:01:01.340
if it was a newer record,
they would always go out and buy it,
you know,
um,

2013
02:01:02.600 --> 02:01:05.850
or,
uh,
you know,
so I taught him about,
you know,

2014
02:01:05.851 --> 02:01:08.020
what was going on and,
uh,

2015
02:01:08.910 --> 02:01:11.970
I can remember talking to Donny Einer,
Billy and I,

2016
02:01:11.971 --> 02:01:16.971
my wife and I went down to meet with them about putting on one of my solo

2017
02:01:17.251 --> 02:01:19.770
records and we were talking to him,

2018
02:01:19.820 --> 02:01:22.720
it was right around when Napster was happening and we said,

2019
02:01:22.740 --> 02:01:26.250
what's going on with that?
It's killing,
it's killing us.
It's like the re,

2020
02:01:26.251 --> 02:01:30.480
you know,
it's coming,
you know,
like a freight train.
And,
and he said,

2021
02:01:31.110 --> 02:01:35.100
it's going to go away.
It's not a big deal.
This is the president of the,

2022
02:01:35.180 --> 02:01:38.940
of the record company.
And he's saying,
everything's going to be fine.
You know,
we,

2023
02:01:39.170 --> 02:01:41.480
this lawsuit with the Ria,

2024
02:01:41.690 --> 02:01:44.720
they're going to shut these people down and everything will be fine.

2025
02:01:45.050 --> 02:01:49.400
Six months later.
Honor is not president of the label anymore.

2026
02:01:49.640 --> 02:01:53.210
Um,
you know,
Napster's spread out and they were figuring,

2027
02:01:53.480 --> 02:01:58.340
starting to figure out ways to,
to,
to get people paid.

2028
02:01:58.341 --> 02:02:03.230
But it was,
it was the horse was out of the barn and it was gone.
And,
and,

2029
02:02:03.231 --> 02:02:06.740
uh,
you know,
they should have just picked up on it right away and made a deal.

2030
02:02:06.741 --> 02:02:10.370
And,
and uh,
it,
it could have been so much better and so,
so different.

2031
02:02:10.371 --> 02:02:13.430
But at that point they were living so high,

2032
02:02:13.850 --> 02:02:17.640
high on the hog or off the hog,
what is it?
I don't know what the extinguisher,

2033
02:02:18.130 --> 02:02:20.420
but,
okay.
And they were,
I mean,

2034
02:02:20.421 --> 02:02:23.420
there was so much money being made the way that they were doing things,

2035
02:02:23.421 --> 02:02:27.260
they didn't think anything could go wrong.
It was that old thing with a worthy,

2036
02:02:27.310 --> 02:02:30.740
with a businessmen actually thought there were more important than the artists

2037
02:02:30.800 --> 02:02:35.110
and not was true from managers to agents to,

2038
02:02:35.150 --> 02:02:36.770
to the record companies.
And

2039
02:02:37.090 --> 02:02:40.350
<v 2>see the piece that Courtney love wrote about that.
No,</v>

2040
02:02:40.560 --> 02:02:43.560
according love wrote this piece.
A lot of people think she's too dominant.

2041
02:02:43.561 --> 02:02:46.170
I've actually written it and that there was somebody ghost wrote it.

2042
02:02:46.680 --> 02:02:49.500
But those people aren't rude.
I Dunno.
How dare they fuck.

2043
02:02:49.501 --> 02:02:51.030
Do you know how smart you ever sit down?

2044
02:02:51.120 --> 02:02:53.610
I never sat down with Courtney love either.
Maybe she is smart,

2045
02:02:53.910 --> 02:02:58.910
but the piece essentially detailed how artists get screwed over by record

2046
02:02:59.491 --> 02:03:03.720
companies and that that's one of the reasons why their model collapses because

2047
02:03:03.721 --> 02:03:06.180
of greed and that these record companies,

2048
02:03:06.181 --> 02:03:11.100
they would spend a lot of money and give this artist like a big,
uh,

2049
02:03:11.130 --> 02:03:16.130
like a record signing fee or recording fee and then everything would come out of

2050
02:03:16.591 --> 02:03:21.080
that.
Like the amount that they would spend on promotion,
the uh,

2051
02:03:21.150 --> 02:03:23.490
what it costs to tour,
everything came out of that.

2052
02:03:23.491 --> 02:03:26.970
And then the artists got paid after all that and then only paid a small

2053
02:03:26.971 --> 02:03:28.740
percentage of the actual process.

2054
02:03:28.810 --> 02:03:32.590
<v 1>Yeah,
I mean it's been set up,
you know,</v>

2055
02:03:32.620 --> 02:03:36.970
basically it for the,
for the businessman who,
I mean,
hey,

2056
02:03:36.971 --> 02:03:40.390
they went to college and got trained,
trained to do that.

2057
02:03:40.630 --> 02:03:45.250
Think of things like that.
And artists don't think like that,
you know,

2058
02:03:45.251 --> 02:03:49.120
I mean there,
there are some of us,
some of them,
you know,
you know,

2059
02:03:49.150 --> 02:03:53.350
figured it out early.
Some of us figured out later.
But it,
you know,

2060
02:03:53.351 --> 02:03:57.220
those standard agreements were always like,
you know,

2061
02:03:57.230 --> 02:04:01.240
lopsided for the benefit,
the record company.
And even in the,

2062
02:04:01.241 --> 02:04:05.770
in the MTV days,
I mean,
we had to pay for the,
for the making of the videos,

2063
02:04:05.771 --> 02:04:08.430
MTV got free programming,
all those,

2064
02:04:08.790 --> 02:04:13.790
all those million dollar videos or the Michael Jackson $25 million videos,

2065
02:04:14.410 --> 02:04:18.310
he would pay for that,
you know,
and then the,
then MTV would get it.
And you know,

2066
02:04:18.670 --> 02:04:20.590
there's the argument that you know,

2067
02:04:20.800 --> 02:04:24.940
that it can make it a bigger record or can make it make it a hit.
You know?

2068
02:04:24.941 --> 02:04:28.780
I mean,
if it's good enough and it gets heard,
but you know,

2069
02:04:28.960 --> 02:04:32.920
bottom line is the bands of paying for it.
It's coming out of their pocket.

2070
02:04:32.990 --> 02:04:35.500
It should at least been 50,
50.

2071
02:04:35.870 --> 02:04:40.140
<v 2>Yeah.
Well the bands or what they're selling,
if it's not for the band,</v>

2072
02:04:40.141 --> 02:04:44.790
there is no fucking label.
There's no record company without the band.

2073
02:04:44.850 --> 02:04:49.710
You don't sell shit when you sell is other people's artwork.
That's it.

2074
02:04:50.160 --> 02:04:53.400
You're not selling pots and pans and fucking coffee machines.

2075
02:04:53.610 --> 02:04:57.930
You're selling music.
The music is created by the artist.

2076
02:04:58.020 --> 02:04:59.460
The fact that it's not a 50,

2077
02:04:59.461 --> 02:05:03.440
50 split is fucking ridiculous and even 50 fifties generous because that's,

2078
02:05:03.480 --> 02:05:07.590
if it's not for the artists,
there is no record label.
You don't sell anything.

2079
02:05:07.730 --> 02:05:12.670
<v 1>And it should change.
If,
if there is is some success,
it should change,
you know,</v>

2080
02:05:12.750 --> 02:05:16.810
to benefit the artists.
Exactly what is going.
But you know,
it's a,

2081
02:05:16.830 --> 02:05:20.960
which is representative of business greed.
It's just been that way since,
since,

2082
02:05:20.961 --> 02:05:25.230
uh,
since Alan Lomax,
God bless him for doing it.
For,

2083
02:05:25.280 --> 02:05:29.800
for recording.
Robert Johnson,
paying them 10 bucks to sing in the kin.
You know,

2084
02:05:29.810 --> 02:05:34.130
like the saying,
old brother,
there's a guy open yob Yazoo city that it'll pay.

2085
02:05:34.131 --> 02:05:37.010
It's an 10 bucks to sing and the can,
you know,

2086
02:05:37.011 --> 02:05:39.750
I'm not telling tales out of school,
but you know,
anyway,

2087
02:05:39.751 --> 02:05:44.120
I think it's a great grape scene because it's,
uh,
uh,
it's,

2088
02:05:44.121 --> 02:05:49.121
it's really typical of how it was from the movie o brother where art thou and

2089
02:05:50.660 --> 02:05:51.493
they went in and they,

2090
02:05:51.560 --> 02:05:55.580
and they pretended and the guy in there was blind and they pretended that one of

2091
02:05:55.581 --> 02:05:59.900
their,
their,
their guitar player was a,
I couldn't speak.

2092
02:06:00.260 --> 02:06:04.670
Um,
so they got an extra 10 bucks because they said he couldn't,

2093
02:06:04.671 --> 02:06:08.390
we'll face this here,
can he,
he can't,
he can't hear,
he can't speak or whatever.

2094
02:06:08.570 --> 02:06:12.680
He had to be able to hear to play guitar,
but he couldn't speak.
So,
uh,
he can't,

2095
02:06:12.980 --> 02:06:16.490
you know,
and so the blind guy just paid them.
There was four of them.

2096
02:06:16.491 --> 02:06:21.050
I think they paid him 50,
50 bucks while singing the can,

2097
02:06:21.260 --> 02:06:24.490
you know.
But it's been like that ever since,
you know,
they've always,
uh,

2098
02:06:24.590 --> 02:06:26.370
I mean the artists have always,
you know,

2099
02:06:26.470 --> 02:06:30.740
they're usually starving and by the time they,
you know,
get anything.

2100
02:06:31.350 --> 02:06:34.610
I can remember there was when we had,

2101
02:06:35.060 --> 02:06:38.360
we had an eviction notice in one hand and a management agreement and the other

2102
02:06:38.570 --> 02:06:41.540
just think we were going to go to a lawyer at that point and say,
well,

2103
02:06:41.541 --> 02:06:42.440
what do you think?
Okay,

2104
02:06:42.441 --> 02:06:45.590
well let's go in and argue with this guy over this or that or whatever.

2105
02:06:45.591 --> 02:06:49.790
And it's like,
that's just,
I mean,
the industry is rife with that.

2106
02:06:49.791 --> 02:06:53.180
I don't think there's an artist that doesn't have some kind of story like that,

2107
02:06:53.480 --> 02:06:56.060
but you know,
if it's,
it's a lot of it has,
you know,

2108
02:06:57.560 --> 02:07:02.330
fortunately we can at least reap the rewards of what we were doing.

2109
02:07:02.331 --> 02:07:03.320
I mean,
back in the day,

2110
02:07:03.321 --> 02:07:07.910
like Van Gogh Guide died penniless and you know of syphilis in some,

2111
02:07:08.060 --> 02:07:11.600
some hot burning down,
you know,
and you know,

2112
02:07:11.870 --> 02:07:16.130
because nobody knew who he was or what he,
what he was,
how good he was,
you know.

2113
02:07:16.210 --> 02:07:19.780
<v 2>Well,
even Nikola Tesla,
I mean,
he died broke too.
He died,
broke them department.</v>

2114
02:07:19.781 --> 02:07:24.100
The government came in and took away all his papers and all of his inventions.

2115
02:07:24.490 --> 02:07:26.770
He died with no money at all.
It's,

2116
02:07:26.830 --> 02:07:30.760
it's what happens when you get someone who's strictly business minded and not

2117
02:07:30.761 --> 02:07:31.540
creative.

2118
02:07:31.540 --> 02:07:35.590
And they deal with impulsive artists who are very creative but often very not

2119
02:07:35.591 --> 02:07:39.850
business minded and they pray off of it.
It's just,
it's pimps and hookers.

2120
02:07:40.210 --> 02:07:43.840
I mean it's just someone taking advantage of someone else's inadequacies in

2121
02:07:43.841 --> 02:07:48.460
certain areas.
And they'll,
artists almost universally suck with business.

2122
02:07:48.760 --> 02:07:51.370
They're almost all in when they get really business oriented,

2123
02:07:51.460 --> 02:07:53.300
they start sucking with their art.
Right?

2124
02:07:53.320 --> 02:07:56.500
And that's one thing that happens to a lot of artists that get super greedy and

2125
02:07:56.501 --> 02:07:59.980
all they care about is I'm going to put together an album that's going to sell a

2126
02:07:59.981 --> 02:08:01.990
fucking billion records and it's,

2127
02:08:01.991 --> 02:08:05.880
I'm going to calculate it and make it very poppy and make it perfect.

2128
02:08:06.450 --> 02:08:08.590
It's just fucking babysitting money.

2129
02:08:08.591 --> 02:08:12.370
And they start thinking about how to make this thing really connect with the

2130
02:08:12.371 --> 02:08:17.020
young kids today.
And they create some sort of a fucking Frankenstein's monster.

2131
02:08:17.170 --> 02:08:19.270
And then the art sucks.

2132
02:08:20.120 --> 02:08:24.800
<v 1>Oh,
it's funny because that,
you know,
that Song Frankenstein by uh,
Edgar Winter,</v>

2133
02:08:24.900 --> 02:08:27.980
uh,
that's actually what they did is they took,

2134
02:08:28.610 --> 02:08:33.610
they took bits and pieces of the jammed and they took bits and pieces of,

2135
02:08:33.691 --> 02:08:37.570
of the gym because they're all brilliant musicians and they,
they,

2136
02:08:37.640 --> 02:08:41.930
they cut it up and they,
they turned it into a,
an instrumental,

2137
02:08:41.950 --> 02:08:44.870
it's three and a half minutes long,
perfect length for a,

2138
02:08:44.890 --> 02:08:46.670
for a single three minutes or whatever.

2139
02:08:47.030 --> 02:08:49.970
And that's turned out to be a huge hit.

2140
02:08:49.971 --> 02:08:54.971
I mean it's now it's a huge hit and apparently the bass player took it one step

2141
02:08:55.101 --> 02:08:55.934
further.

2142
02:08:56.000 --> 02:09:01.000
And when analyzed like the top 10 songs for like three months and you know,

2143
02:09:04.180 --> 02:09:08.570
kind of the beats per minute,
what key it was in how,
how off,
how quick the,

2144
02:09:08.860 --> 02:09:13.670
the chorus came,
you know,
after the song started,
how quick the,
you know,
what the,

2145
02:09:13.671 --> 02:09:15.470
what the lyrics were about,
I mean,

2146
02:09:15.540 --> 02:09:20.540
analyzed 10 or 15 different parameters and then wrote a song based on that.

2147
02:09:20.630 --> 02:09:24.440
And it was a huge hit.
I don't know which,
which song it was,
but it worked.

2148
02:09:24.770 --> 02:09:28.640
And I'm sure there are guys sitting around writing programs now to just to do

2149
02:09:28.641 --> 02:09:33.430
just that,
you know,
uh,
to,
to figure that out,
you know,
because uh,

2150
02:09:33.650 --> 02:09:37.910
so much of the music does sound like it came out of a spit out of a computer.

2151
02:09:38.090 --> 02:09:38.820
Well,
you can tell them

2152
02:09:38.820 --> 02:09:42.300
<v 2>the difference though from a song is written from an individual's perspective</v>

2153
02:09:42.301 --> 02:09:44.810
and a music,
a song that's written,
that's his sort of,

2154
02:09:44.811 --> 02:09:48.620
someone's trying to like sell it and now someone just a riding the,

2155
02:09:48.640 --> 02:09:52.620
the a pop piece and now they're,

2156
02:09:52.621 --> 02:09:56.010
they're just creating something that they know is going to,

2157
02:09:56.040 --> 02:09:57.240
this is going to be profitable.

2158
02:09:57.540 --> 02:10:00.210
It's not a representative of their thoughts and their feelings.

2159
02:10:00.211 --> 02:10:05.211
That's why when someone does create something that Julie has like some emotion

2160
02:10:05.281 --> 02:10:09.450
behind it,
like,
uh,
oftentimes when a band is really young,

2161
02:10:09.480 --> 02:10:13.890
especially they create their best work because they're hungry and because

2162
02:10:13.891 --> 02:10:17.580
everything is coming from like a real place and they haven't figured out how to

2163
02:10:17.581 --> 02:10:18.480
be calculated yet.

2164
02:10:18.640 --> 02:10:21.540
<v 1>Right.
Oh,
there's no doubt.
I mean,
I,</v>

2165
02:10:22.280 --> 02:10:27.170
the only thing that we use for parameter in,
in,
I'm in Steven really wanted,

2166
02:10:27.650 --> 02:10:29.570
which was good because he,
you know,

2167
02:10:29.571 --> 02:10:34.340
we really didn't know anything about like how,
how were,

2168
02:10:34.341 --> 02:10:35.600
where it could go in a year.

2169
02:10:35.960 --> 02:10:39.380
So he had been in the business for a couple of years.
But for us,

2170
02:10:39.470 --> 02:10:42.860
I mean the only thing that we,
that we,
uh,

2171
02:10:43.040 --> 02:10:46.310
would think about is how the song is going to go down with play it live.

2172
02:10:46.610 --> 02:10:50.810
How can we make it exciting enough?
So,
and like,
cause we would always think of a,

2173
02:10:50.811 --> 02:10:54.230
about us sitting in the audience because we were fans.
I mean,

2174
02:10:54.231 --> 02:10:58.940
we would go to seed,
the seed,
the bands,
you know,
and uh,
figuring out what,

2175
02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:02.930
what got us off about it and try and figure out what is it,
is it,
is it the beat,

2176
02:11:02.931 --> 02:11:07.910
is it the whatever it is,
you know?
And,
but it was on a much more,
uh,

2177
02:11:08.160 --> 02:11:12.890
uh,
some,
some subconscious level.
I mean,

2178
02:11:13.130 --> 02:11:17.630
it was all about feeling,
you know,
and it kind of help steer us towards,

2179
02:11:17.870 --> 02:11:21.740
cause I knew that there was something we could,
we could do to put a different,

2180
02:11:22.040 --> 02:11:26.240
different slant on what had already been done.
You know,
it always had that,

2181
02:11:26.270 --> 02:11:30.380
that feeling about,
you know,
the songs that we wrote.
And uh,

2182
02:11:30.590 --> 02:11:35.240
but the main thing was like getting an audience off live cause that's the only

2183
02:11:35.241 --> 02:11:38.300
place you could do it.
I mean,
you didn't have any other outlet,
you know,

2184
02:11:38.301 --> 02:11:43.190
unless you're lucky enough to get a song on the radio,
which was nice,
you know,

2185
02:11:43.191 --> 02:11:47.780
and uh,
Steven always like wanted to kind of push things that way.

2186
02:11:47.781 --> 02:11:51.770
So it really,
we made a good,
a good team like that because,
you know,

2187
02:11:51.860 --> 02:11:56.010
I'd be the anarchist,
you know,
I don't care if we're playing in tune,
you know,

2188
02:11:56.011 --> 02:11:58.750
I just want to get out there and excite the audience and he's,

2189
02:11:58.760 --> 02:12:03.300
he's thinking about,
well you know,
the melody and the course and it was a,

2190
02:12:03.500 --> 02:12:07.970
it was a really good,
it is a good hookup when we get together.
You know,

2191
02:12:08.500 --> 02:12:12.830
what do you guys argue about things creatively about like what kinds of songs

2192
02:12:12.831 --> 02:12:16.620
you guys couldn't yeah.
That's where we meet,
had the head,
you know,
and,

2193
02:12:16.621 --> 02:12:18.380
and butt heads.
And,
uh,

2194
02:12:18.410 --> 02:12:22.030
but that I think is part of the creative process when you're working with,
uh,

2195
02:12:22.420 --> 02:12:24.770
you know,
working with five guys,
you know,

2196
02:12:24.790 --> 02:12:29.240
and especially to a type personalities that,
you know,

2197
02:12:29.241 --> 02:12:33.650
go head to head,
you know.
Um,
and I think that's been the value of,
of the,

2198
02:12:33.850 --> 02:12:38.540
of putting up with it all.
And,
uh,
so anyway,
that's,
that's the,

2199
02:12:38.541 --> 02:12:39.830
uh,
but then again,

2200
02:12:40.310 --> 02:12:42.560
there wasn't a lot of room in there to think about the business,

2201
02:12:42.620 --> 02:12:47.030
you know what I mean?
And,
uh,
um,
I mean he was,

2202
02:12:47.090 --> 02:12:49.830
he was definitely more cognizant of,

2203
02:12:49.831 --> 02:12:52.670
of like what it meant to have your name under the songs.

2204
02:12:52.970 --> 02:12:54.880
I just looked at the name under the songs,
like,

2205
02:12:54.950 --> 02:12:59.150
like who really was responsible so I could get the real one because I knew that

2206
02:12:59.151 --> 02:13:01.700
like,
look at first two stones records,

2207
02:13:02.030 --> 02:13:06.860
they were mostly covers of like Willie Dixon songs or,
uh,
you know,

2208
02:13:07.580 --> 02:13:11.060
Chuck Berry and all that.
And,
you know,
there were,
there were,
you know,

2209
02:13:11.570 --> 02:13:15.290
they were exploring their roots,
you know,
and they made no bones about it,

2210
02:13:15.320 --> 02:13:18.470
you know,
so,
uh,
but again,
it's about,

2211
02:13:19.480 --> 02:13:23.930
you so consumed with was with trying to figure out how to make it work.
You know,

2212
02:13:24.170 --> 02:13:28.010
you're not thinking about,
you know,
well,
how can I get another point here?

2213
02:13:28.011 --> 02:13:29.630
How can I get another,
you know,

2214
02:13:29.900 --> 02:13:34.870
another 25,000 off of this advance in that kind of thing.
I mean,
it's like,
uh,

2215
02:13:35.670 --> 02:13:38.610
like I said,
it's,
it's kind of stacked against the artists.

2216
02:13:38.670 --> 02:13:43.110
I really think that the real artists or they're wired different than,

2217
02:13:43.170 --> 02:13:47.910
than businessmen set.
I mean,
and so what's a stir with you?

2218
02:13:48.060 --> 02:13:50.370
You got both.
I mean,

2219
02:13:50.371 --> 02:13:54.900
you seem to be doing okay and you're really creative and really like,

2220
02:13:55.030 --> 02:13:56.250
uh,
you know,

2221
02:13:56.420 --> 02:14:00.080
<v 2>but I don't think about money.
I don't think about like,
do this for money,</v>

2222
02:14:00.081 --> 02:14:02.240
do that.
I just think,
what do I want to do?
You know?

2223
02:14:02.241 --> 02:14:04.730
Like there's a lot of things that I've done that I probably should have never

2224
02:14:04.731 --> 02:14:08.720
done.
You know,
like the only thing I did for money was fear factor.

2225
02:14:08.960 --> 02:14:11.990
Definitely did that for money,
but I didn't think it was going to work.

2226
02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:13.790
I thought I was doing it for fun.

2227
02:14:14.120 --> 02:14:15.680
Like when I first started doing it and I was like,

2228
02:14:15.681 --> 02:14:18.290
they're going to sick dogs on people and make them eat animal dicks.

2229
02:14:18.440 --> 02:14:20.780
How long has this funny thing going to be on TV?
I'm like,

2230
02:14:20.781 --> 02:14:25.781
this is just going to be a like a four or five episode catastrophe that I'm

2231
02:14:25.791 --> 02:14:27.110
going to have some great jokes about.

2232
02:14:27.360 --> 02:14:31.150
Then it wound up doing 148 episodes and then another run later,

2233
02:14:31.210 --> 02:14:33.860
six or seven episodes we did the second time around.
I'm like,

2234
02:14:33.861 --> 02:14:36.650
I couldn't believe it.
I every day I would show up.
I'd be like,
really?

2235
02:14:36.680 --> 02:14:39.350
We're still doing this?
Alright,
here we go.

2236
02:14:39.530 --> 02:14:42.500
I couldn't believe it was successful if it was one.

2237
02:14:42.740 --> 02:14:45.080
I don't think anything I've ever done was a mistake,

2238
02:14:45.290 --> 02:14:48.680
but if there's one thing that I did that I didn't enjoy that much,
it was that,

2239
02:14:49.310 --> 02:14:51.080
but it was a shit load of money.
I was like,
I couldn't,

2240
02:14:51.350 --> 02:14:55.190
but the good thing about having money is then I didn't have to worry about money

2241
02:14:55.191 --> 02:14:59.590
at all and everything I did,
like when I was working for the UFC and all the,

2242
02:14:59.591 --> 02:15:03.470
all the other different things that I've done where for a comedian to be a cage

2243
02:15:03.471 --> 02:15:07.820
fighting commentator,
probably not the best idea.
You know,
like for your career.

2244
02:15:07.970 --> 02:15:11.380
Like most people would say like that's a terrible thing to be connected to your,

2245
02:15:11.381 --> 02:15:16.130
you're connecting,
laughing and joking with horrible bloody violence.
Right.

2246
02:15:16.160 --> 02:15:19.340
But I'd still,
what I wanted to do,
I just,
I,
I,

2247
02:15:19.341 --> 02:15:21.980
this is something that I was interested in,
so I wound up doing it.

2248
02:15:22.250 --> 02:15:26.630
So that makes a lot of sense.
Then my success has been in spite of myself.

2249
02:15:26.750 --> 02:15:31.110
<v 1>Yeah.
Well that's,
he's still followed,
followed you and,</v>

2250
02:15:31.590 --> 02:15:34.700
and you know,
and the ideas and doing it.
I mean,

2251
02:15:34.701 --> 02:15:36.410
I can relate to that because I felt,

2252
02:15:36.411 --> 02:15:41.180
I feel the same way about to run DMC thing because it wasn't anything we
planned.

2253
02:15:41.181 --> 02:15:45.110
It wasn't anything that we,
well,
if we go down the road,
we'll do a video,
will,

2254
02:15:45.120 --> 02:15:48.120
it'll come out and it's gonna like do this.
It was a black and white,

2255
02:15:48.121 --> 02:15:52.970
it's going to do this and joined together and all that wasn't anything like
that.

2256
02:15:52.971 --> 02:15:57.150
It just sounded like fun to work with this new form of,
of,

2257
02:15:57.940 --> 02:16:02.920
of blues really.
You know?
And,
uh,
and it just,
one thing led to the next and uh,

2258
02:16:03.380 --> 02:16:07.280
it was,
it was fun.
It was the original Mashup.
Yeah.
And it was like,

2259
02:16:07.760 --> 02:16:11.840
Holy Shit,
man,
the turn,
we really did something here.
And,

2260
02:16:11.870 --> 02:16:16.160
but it was after the fact I'd like to take credit for,
for thinking of it,

2261
02:16:16.161 --> 02:16:19.340
you know,
and thinking of the long term effect of it.
But you know,

2262
02:16:19.341 --> 02:16:23.620
it was really about the art,
just the love of the planet and,

2263
02:16:23.910 --> 02:16:27.290
and meeting some new musicians that were doing something new and,

2264
02:16:27.291 --> 02:16:30.030
and the whole thing.
So you,
that was a phantom.
It was

2265
02:16:30.030 --> 02:16:34.690
<v 3>a song big as 140 shows,
you know,
and uh,
fear factor.</v>

2266
02:16:34.691 --> 02:16:36.580
But you know,
it was bigger because it's actually good.

2267
02:16:38.180 --> 02:16:40.360
It was when you guys did that though,

2268
02:16:40.361 --> 02:16:45.361
you got music video was so important too because it was combined the two styles

2269
02:16:45.461 --> 02:16:47.080
together and it was funny.
Yeah.

2270
02:16:47.150 --> 02:16:50.800
You know the video was funny and the song was fucking fantastic because it was

2271
02:16:50.801 --> 02:16:52.480
based on a classic song,

2272
02:16:52.600 --> 02:16:56.440
a classic Aerosmith song and everybody already loved and then you added this run

2273
02:16:56.441 --> 02:17:01.030
DMC element to it with a different kind of music and ah,
fucking loved that song.

2274
02:17:01.031 --> 02:17:06.031
And it was a fantastic combining and I think it made fans out of people who were

2275
02:17:06.790 --> 02:17:10.570
initially fans of both genres and people were wrapped pants became Aerosmith

2276
02:17:10.571 --> 02:17:15.160
fans,
people who are Aerosmith fans became run DMC fans.
Yeah.
It was interesting.

2277
02:17:15.190 --> 02:17:20.190
I think we got like literally literally two letters from fans that said,

2278
02:17:20.620 --> 02:17:24.040
what are you doing rec,
you know,
wrecking your hard rock thing.

2279
02:17:24.100 --> 02:17:24.940
You know what I mean?

2280
02:17:24.970 --> 02:17:29.240
And I think the guys at run DMC where they,

2281
02:17:29.250 --> 02:17:33.040
they were kind of,
they really didn't want to do it.
It was Rick Rubin,

2282
02:17:33.041 --> 02:17:36.010
the kind of said,
come on guys,
let's just try it.
Because they would,

2283
02:17:36.040 --> 02:17:39.100
they would knew they were doing something new when they were having great

2284
02:17:39.101 --> 02:17:42.730
success to them,
what they were doing,
you know,
um,
on their own.

2285
02:17:42.731 --> 02:17:46.660
So it was kind of like Rick just said,
well,
let's just try it.

2286
02:17:46.720 --> 02:17:50.500
And because we didn't know if it was going to go on the album and he just said,

2287
02:17:50.770 --> 02:17:55.300
and he told us that.
And you know,
again,
we just looked at it like,
hey,

2288
02:17:55.301 --> 02:17:59.950
well the flying us to New York,
we'll have a great time.
Hang out,
meet these guys,

2289
02:17:59.951 --> 02:18:04.420
that will be fun.
And,
uh,
and then in fact,
Billy,

2290
02:18:04.450 --> 02:18:09.040
we needed some girls so it would look like a,
like a rock,
like a rock,

2291
02:18:09.100 --> 02:18:12.010
you know,
rehearsal studio where there would be girls.

2292
02:18:12.310 --> 02:18:16.840
And Steven had his wife and I had my wife in this sitting in the background,

2293
02:18:16.841 --> 02:18:21.460
so you can see him in Billy's pregnant with,
uh,
with Tony and,
uh,

2294
02:18:21.550 --> 02:18:26.340
how rock and roll pregnant checks.
Anyway,

2295
02:18:26.350 --> 02:18:30.310
it was,
Tony was there and uh,
it was,
uh,

2296
02:18:30.610 --> 02:18:33.890
but it was one of those things,
you just did it.
We just did it for the most.

2297
02:18:34.270 --> 02:18:38.770
That's why it was so awesome and it was a,
it was fun.
And uh,
it was,
uh,

2298
02:18:38.860 --> 02:18:40.750
it turned out to be a good thing,
you know.

2299
02:18:41.110 --> 02:18:43.570
How do record companies make money now?

2300
02:18:44.050 --> 02:18:47.680
Because it seems like nobody's bombing.
Not very well.

2301
02:18:47.681 --> 02:18:50.560
We talked about it the other day that this is going to be one of the first years

2302
02:18:50.561 --> 02:18:54.490
ever where no bands go platinum.
Interesting.

2303
02:18:54.580 --> 02:18:59.440
It's crazy cause it's like you look at the numbers and it's amazing.

2304
02:18:59.470 --> 02:19:03.360
It's an appalling are astounding or I don't know,
whatever you want to call it,

2305
02:19:04.030 --> 02:19:04.863
the shift.

2306
02:19:05.680 --> 02:19:10.650
I mean the people that get dropped from the companies and the different

2307
02:19:10.660 --> 02:19:14.910
companies that still,
you know,
that kind of like,
uh,
you know,

2308
02:19:14.920 --> 02:19:16.030
they used to be all these,

2309
02:19:16.031 --> 02:19:20.560
these offshoot labels and stuff and all those are gone and so many people that I

2310
02:19:20.561 --> 02:19:21.280
know that,

2311
02:19:21.280 --> 02:19:24.880
that really had a good heart for the music where they're in it for the music

2312
02:19:24.881 --> 02:19:28.010
have been,
you know,
been fired and it just,
there

2313
02:19:28.010 --> 02:19:31.490
<v 1>just isn't there,
just don't do the kind of business they used to do.
I mean,</v>

2314
02:19:31.491 --> 02:19:36.290
we've really lived through an amazing age,
you know,
to see the,
to see some,

2315
02:19:36.410 --> 02:19:39.620
some amazing bands,
you know,
come up and,
and uh,

2316
02:19:39.980 --> 02:19:43.190
at least for rock and roll and,
uh,
you know,

2317
02:19:43.250 --> 02:19:47.870
I really believe we're at the end of an era,
you know,
cause it's just the,
the,

2318
02:19:48.030 --> 02:19:50.870
the record industry that,
that,
you know,

2319
02:19:50.871 --> 02:19:54.050
did arguably drive a lot of the artists,

2320
02:19:54.051 --> 02:19:59.051
especially the early days when they would give artists enough money so that even

2321
02:19:59.151 --> 02:20:03.200
if their first record wasn't that good like us,
that we had enough money,

2322
02:20:03.201 --> 02:20:07.680
we could,
we could support ourselves to do another record.
It was like,
you know,

2323
02:20:07.850 --> 02:20:10.430
they were kind of nurturing us,
you know,
and there was,

2324
02:20:10.520 --> 02:20:13.910
there was a lot of that in those days because they had the money to do it.

2325
02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:17.570
And even though we ended up paying for it out of our royalties,

2326
02:20:18.170 --> 02:20:23.150
it helped us get to be a better band and made us insight into,
you know,

2327
02:20:23.510 --> 02:20:26.840
what we are.
Uh,
and those days are over.
You know,

2328
02:20:26.841 --> 02:20:30.590
now it's like bands practically have to pay to,
to,
uh,

2329
02:20:30.980 --> 02:20:35.370
to play clubs,
tip to,
uh,
I mean they go on.
What's that,

2330
02:20:35.430 --> 02:20:39.410
that business thing that did a,
I guess you,
you,
uh,
say,
well,

2331
02:20:39.590 --> 02:20:43.760
I'll give you a record and a tee shirt.
If you send $10,
I mean,

2332
02:20:44.180 --> 02:20:47.690
to start a business starters,
you know,
something like that.
And you know,

2333
02:20:47.691 --> 02:20:52.691
so that's the record in an industry now and it's something in front of our eyes.

2334
02:20:53.170 --> 02:20:57.200
It's like disappearing and it's,
nothing's really replacing it.
So,
I mean,

2335
02:20:57.890 --> 02:21:01.720
in the,
in the,
in the sense that we knew it,
you know what I mean?
It's always,

2336
02:21:01.760 --> 02:21:06.440
there's always going to be some vehicle for the artists to get their music to

2337
02:21:06.441 --> 02:21:08.540
the fans.
And that will never change.
I mean,

2338
02:21:08.810 --> 02:21:13.700
the excitement of going to a live show,
just like going to a hockey game,
that's,

2339
02:21:13.730 --> 02:21:16.720
that there's nothing that can beat going to a hockey game,
you know,

2340
02:21:16.721 --> 02:21:19.460
you can watch it on TV all day.
We'll never get the same rushes,

2341
02:21:19.700 --> 02:21:24.210
five minutes watching,
watching the Bruins go for it,
you know?
Um,

2342
02:21:24.320 --> 02:21:28.140
so I think that there will always be that live thing if it's going to,

2343
02:21:28.190 --> 02:21:30.980
I don't know if it's going to be the kind of music that we like,

2344
02:21:30.981 --> 02:21:35.360
but it's always going to be there.
But,
uh,
as far as as,

2345
02:21:35.420 --> 02:21:39.680
um,
getting the music,
you know,
other than that,
I mean it's,
it's,

2346
02:21:39.710 --> 02:21:44.150
it's getting to be more and more like air because now it used to be,

2347
02:21:44.300 --> 02:21:49.020
you know,
even if I did like,
like I just played on the Johnny Winter Record,
uh,

2348
02:21:49.080 --> 02:21:52.730
bef before he passed away,
which is a,
I mean,

2349
02:21:53.210 --> 02:21:54.980
he was a big influence on me,
you know,

2350
02:21:55.290 --> 02:22:00.140
at the start and enough still go back and listen to his records,
you know,

2351
02:22:00.141 --> 02:22:02.570
for inspiration.
And,
uh,

2352
02:22:02.630 --> 02:22:06.470
he asked me to play on his record and they sent the,
uh,
the,
uh,

2353
02:22:06.530 --> 02:22:09.410
software for the,
for the,
for the record.

2354
02:22:09.440 --> 02:22:13.070
And I just played it in the studio and he was in New York.
I was in la,

2355
02:22:13.150 --> 02:22:17.110
in La and I,
and then they sent it back to them and they mixed it.

2356
02:22:17.280 --> 02:22:20.180
And it sounded like I was in the studio with them,
you know,

2357
02:22:20.240 --> 02:22:23.980
and now they don't even have to send a,
the software,
they just send it over,

2358
02:22:24.230 --> 02:22:28.290
you know,
over over the Internet.
I mean it's so it's really just air.

2359
02:22:28.350 --> 02:22:33.000
It's like nothing.
It's,
but it's just an idea almost,
you know.
Um,

2360
02:22:33.590 --> 02:22:35.880
um,
that's why it's so interesting.

2361
02:22:36.120 --> 02:22:40.200
Like this last week a couple of people who've given me vinyl again,
you know,

2362
02:22:40.201 --> 02:22:42.300
people are putting on putting on vinyl.

2363
02:22:42.420 --> 02:22:47.420
I mean like a 45 it was four songs on it or like a whole album of vinyl because

2364
02:22:48.931 --> 02:22:50.640
they know that that um,

2365
02:22:50.670 --> 02:22:53.160
the few people that are actually going to sit down and listen,

2366
02:22:53.700 --> 02:22:57.570
we'd rather hear it on vinyl or they're hoping they will then then like off

2367
02:22:57.571 --> 02:23:01.560
something like this because it just doesn't sound as good off of that.

2368
02:23:01.580 --> 02:23:05.330
<v 2>Don't you think that there is some sort of a blow back thing that's going on</v>

2369
02:23:05.331 --> 02:23:07.280
with all sorts of aspects of our culture?

2370
02:23:07.281 --> 02:23:09.650
Like we were talking earlier about farmer's markets.

2371
02:23:09.820 --> 02:23:13.580
Like that's becoming a really popular to like buy food directly from the people

2372
02:23:13.581 --> 02:23:14.414
that grow it.

2373
02:23:14.420 --> 02:23:18.290
I go to this farmers market and Malibu sometimes and that's amazing man.

2374
02:23:18.291 --> 02:23:19.760
You go there,
you meet the farmers,

2375
02:23:19.761 --> 02:23:22.850
the people that are actually growing the food and it says it feels good.

2376
02:23:23.120 --> 02:23:25.910
There's something about it.
And then local restaurants,

2377
02:23:25.911 --> 02:23:29.630
like people are getting tired of going to these big factory fucking chains and

2378
02:23:29.870 --> 02:23:33.950
people are supporting like local coffee shops and coffee growers and like

2379
02:23:34.040 --> 02:23:36.050
there's this thing that's going on.

2380
02:23:36.051 --> 02:23:38.600
Like people are buying vinyl now and people were,

2381
02:23:38.750 --> 02:23:42.410
they liked to go see live music again.
It's like,
not that it ever went away,

2382
02:23:42.411 --> 02:23:43.244
but it's like,

2383
02:23:43.490 --> 02:23:47.750
it's becoming more where people understand that there's something missing in

2384
02:23:47.751 --> 02:23:52.751
this corporate created plastic world that we've sort of been forced into dealing

2385
02:23:53.301 --> 02:23:56.240
with.
And then the blow back is people like,

2386
02:23:57.080 --> 02:24:00.380
one of the things I love about places like Seattle,
like you go to Seattle,

2387
02:24:00.810 --> 02:24:03.440
it's hard to find the chain restaurant there.
It's hard.

2388
02:24:03.570 --> 02:24:07.370
Everything is like these individual restaurants and great,
it's great.

2389
02:24:07.510 --> 02:24:11.500
<v 1>I only hope and hope that it happens fast enough.
You know what I mean?
Because</v>

2390
02:24:13.170 --> 02:24:16.720
it's going to happen however it's going to happen,
you know?
I mean,

2391
02:24:17.530 --> 02:24:18.370
I wish he would,
you know,

2392
02:24:18.430 --> 02:24:22.210
like all of a sudden just sweep across the country and it would be great,

2393
02:24:22.211 --> 02:24:24.280
but it's going to happen as it happens.

2394
02:24:24.281 --> 02:24:27.040
And it's one of the things I love about from what I mean,

2395
02:24:27.340 --> 02:24:31.390
you go up and down the street and,
and the,
the people that are,

2396
02:24:31.391 --> 02:24:35.470
that are farmers are,
you know,
they'll actually barter,
you know,

2397
02:24:35.471 --> 02:24:38.350
they'll go to the farmer's market and they'll sell trade offs.
You know,

2398
02:24:38.351 --> 02:24:39.184
what they're,

2399
02:24:39.480 --> 02:24:43.330
they're growing or whatever with somebody else who's growing something else.

2400
02:24:43.390 --> 02:24:48.250
And it's like,
it's really benefits everybody.
It's great.

2401
02:24:48.310 --> 02:24:49.270
I love that.

2402
02:24:49.330 --> 02:24:53.230
And it's exactly like what you're talking about going to the farmer's market

2403
02:24:53.680 --> 02:24:54.513
here.
So it's,

2404
02:24:54.720 --> 02:24:58.170
<v 2>yeah,
I think I really do think that there's some sort of a push back,</v>

2405
02:24:58.500 --> 02:25:03.390
but until they can figure out how to way to make a record,
like vinyl,

2406
02:25:03.840 --> 02:25:06.450
make that sound on your iPhone.
Like can they do that?

2407
02:25:06.480 --> 02:25:07.830
Is that ever going to be possible?

2408
02:25:07.890 --> 02:25:11.730
<v 1>Well,
they keep talking about it.
Um,
but I,
you know,
um,</v>

2409
02:25:12.590 --> 02:25:17.160
there's this supposedly a new,
a new,
um,
they click call it modeling.

2410
02:25:18.120 --> 02:25:23.120
They actually like the software models a guitar to they go in and they measure

2411
02:25:23.200 --> 02:25:28.120
everything about like they've measured the sound of this room without any noise

2412
02:25:28.121 --> 02:25:29.380
in it at all because there's,

2413
02:25:29.420 --> 02:25:33.310
there's an ambien feeling to the room without any sound at all.

2414
02:25:33.550 --> 02:25:34.940
They start with that and then they,

2415
02:25:34.941 --> 02:25:38.050
then they take the amplifier and they said it and then they,

2416
02:25:38.510 --> 02:25:42.760
they measure every perimeter they can and then they put it in the software.

2417
02:25:43.180 --> 02:25:46.650
And there are some people right now that,
that,

2418
02:25:46.770 --> 02:25:51.730
that I can't believe that they are actually buying it.
I haven't heard it yet.

2419
02:25:51.731 --> 02:25:54.970
There's a new one out.
The guitar players are using in there.

2420
02:25:55.290 --> 02:25:58.690
They're saying a blindfold test.
It really works.
I mean there's a,

2421
02:25:59.020 --> 02:26:01.500
there's a hand feel that,
um,

2422
02:26:01.770 --> 02:26:04.510
kind of gets in the way when you plan through one of these things.

2423
02:26:04.510 --> 02:26:08.680
It just doesn't feel quite the same.
It's almost like if you're playing clarinet,

2424
02:26:09.070 --> 02:26:13.060
imagine like playing with little bits of cotton on each,
each thing,
you know,

2425
02:26:13.360 --> 02:26:17.680
there's this kind of a feel to it that isn't quite there when you play,

2426
02:26:18.040 --> 02:26:21.880
as opposed to when you're playing like right into it,
into an amp,
you know,
and,

2427
02:26:21.890 --> 02:26:25.750
uh,
but,
but some this swearing by it right now.

2428
02:26:25.751 --> 02:26:30.250
So I don't know if,
uh,
you know,
because the number of bits and all that,

2429
02:26:30.251 --> 02:26:33.030
because it all gets squeezed back down again.
It gets,

2430
02:26:33.031 --> 02:26:36.040
it's like 96 bits or whatever,
140,

2431
02:26:36.550 --> 02:26:41.320
but it still gets squeezed down to 16 bits,
so it can only get as good as this,

2432
02:26:41.321 --> 02:26:43.480
you know,
when you're listening to it.
So,

2433
02:26:43.640 --> 02:26:46.610
<v 2>but as the,
the capacity of the storage capacity grows,</v>

2434
02:26:46.611 --> 02:26:51.020
like this phone has 120 something gigs,
they're getting bigger and bigger.

2435
02:26:51.090 --> 02:26:55.980
<v 1>Well,
I think that you can store more bad sounding music,
you know,
I mean,</v>

2436
02:26:55.981 --> 02:27:00.780
there's definitely that.
Um,
but,
uh,
you know,
I mean,
when you look at movies on,

2437
02:27:00.930 --> 02:27:05.580
on watching a movie on there,
I mean,
I dunno,
I dunno man.

2438
02:27:05.610 --> 02:27:10.560
Um,
some of these,
I mean people are making movies on these,
you know what I mean?

2439
02:27:10.561 --> 02:27:12.900
Independent movies.
And if you're just sitting there and that's,

2440
02:27:12.901 --> 02:27:16.140
that's all you seeing,
you know,
it looks pretty good.

2441
02:27:16.340 --> 02:27:21.200
<v 2>Well My,
uh,
my galaxy can do four k could do four k video,</v>

2442
02:27:21.500 --> 02:27:25.320
which is insane.
I mean the thing about like the android phones,

2443
02:27:25.370 --> 02:27:27.710
you can store them on cards.

2444
02:27:27.711 --> 02:27:32.240
You can insert little different little a storage cards like which can't do on an

2445
02:27:32.241 --> 02:27:32.990
iPhone.

2446
02:27:32.990 --> 02:27:37.990
And so you could conceivably make a whole movie that looks fantastic off of a

2447
02:27:39.501 --> 02:27:40.334
fucking phone.

2448
02:27:41.360 --> 02:27:43.850
<v 1>No,
there,
I know that there are,
if there is a movie,</v>

2449
02:27:44.020 --> 02:27:48.950
an independent movie that it's gone to Cannes,
that that is was made on a,

2450
02:27:49.490 --> 02:27:53.060
I dunno if you know what,
at one or or whatever,
but I know it,

2451
02:27:53.061 --> 02:27:57.950
the quality was made off of itself,
made off of a bunch of iPhones.
But,
uh,

2452
02:27:58.400 --> 02:28:03.170
so it's like a,
it's again,
it comes down to your eye or the,

2453
02:28:03.270 --> 02:28:06.230
the quality of the shot and,
you know,

2454
02:28:06.260 --> 02:28:08.600
cause they have to adapt it because you know,

2455
02:28:08.601 --> 02:28:11.770
you're limited by the Lens on my phone and all that.

2456
02:28:11.780 --> 02:28:15.620
They have additional lenses you can add to those things and so on the case and

2457
02:28:15.621 --> 02:28:19.790
then,
uh,
and also software can can replicate that too.
But,
um,

2458
02:28:20.270 --> 02:28:25.190
but you know,
I,
it's um,
um,
it's really,
uh,
again,
I don't,

2459
02:28:25.460 --> 02:28:30.140
I don't believe there are any right or wrong sounds.
Um,
you know,

2460
02:28:30.141 --> 02:28:32.900
I mean,
I'll pick up anything.
This thing I can make,

2461
02:28:33.260 --> 02:28:36.200
I can turn that into a rhythm machine,
you know,
with the coffee,

2462
02:28:36.201 --> 02:28:40.340
with the right stuff,
uh,
with the right stuff in there and you know,

2463
02:28:40.341 --> 02:28:44.390
by speeding it up and,
you know,
adding some subs to it or something like that.

2464
02:28:44.530 --> 02:28:48.470
<v 2>Well,
Jamaican dudes that make those incredible sounds from oil drums.
Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

2465
02:28:48.510 --> 02:28:48.650
They,

2466
02:28:48.650 --> 02:28:53.600
they pound those drums down then saw and half and then figure out a way to,

2467
02:28:53.630 --> 02:28:58.620
to,
to beat them with like certain types of,
uh,
uh,
drum instruments or,

2468
02:28:58.621 --> 02:29:02.310
you know,
sticks.
They sound incredible.
They do beautiful music

2469
02:29:02.370 --> 02:29:06.890
<v 1>with those things.
Hey,
you know,
so there's,
there's,
there's no bad side.</v>

2470
02:29:06.920 --> 02:29:09.650
I mean,
of course this sounds,
I mean,
like a Jackhammer.

2471
02:29:09.780 --> 02:29:12.720
You don't want to hear the whole song,
you know,
builds around the jacket.

2472
02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:16.670
<v 2>Kind of cool to have a general Amos in the middle of some,
you know,</v>

2473
02:29:16.680 --> 02:29:17.610
for whatever reason.

2474
02:29:17.780 --> 02:29:20.600
<v 1>That's why I don't think that's why whenever I,
I,</v>

2475
02:29:21.110 --> 02:29:23.270
I mean there's a music store down in,

2476
02:29:23.420 --> 02:29:27.160
in the village called music in and it's run by these two,

2477
02:29:27.740 --> 02:29:32.740
two old hippies that used to play sitar between bands at the Fillmore.

2478
02:29:33.350 --> 02:29:37.730
And,
uh,
they're just a,
it costs a dollar to get in,
you know,

2479
02:29:37.731 --> 02:29:40.670
cause they don't use it into the music store because they don't want like,

2480
02:29:40.671 --> 02:29:43.740
you know,
just,
I mean there's,
there's one aisle,

2481
02:29:43.790 --> 02:29:48.020
it goes this way and it goes around and comes back out and they have stuff from

2482
02:29:48.021 --> 02:29:50.600
all over the world here that did,
or just,
you know,

2483
02:29:50.640 --> 02:29:54.560
instruments you've never seen or thought of,
you know,

2484
02:29:54.561 --> 02:29:56.040
could make music and,

2485
02:29:56.170 --> 02:30:01.170
and all go out and go in and buy a box full of it looks like junk.

2486
02:30:01.850 --> 02:30:06.850
But you take that out and you can fiddle with it and it can be the,

2487
02:30:07.251 --> 02:30:12.230
uh,
inspiration for a song,
you know?
So,
uh,
um,
again,

2488
02:30:12.231 --> 02:30:16.600
it's,
it's what your ear,
what works for you.
So you know,

2489
02:30:16.670 --> 02:30:19.970
the kids now,
I mean,
and most people that haven't heard vinyl,

2490
02:30:21.040 --> 02:30:25.010
this has gotten to the point where it,
it sounds really good.
You know,

2491
02:30:25.011 --> 02:30:30.011
you've got subs there actually it can reproduce more sound than then you could

2492
02:30:30.231 --> 02:30:32.600
get off of off of,
uh,
a final,

2493
02:30:32.601 --> 02:30:36.410
I remember we used to have to put the penny on some of the English records

2494
02:30:36.411 --> 02:30:40.070
because the bottom end would be so strong it would make the needle skip.

2495
02:30:40.370 --> 02:30:42.740
So he had to put a penny on it.
When you put on like a,

2496
02:30:43.250 --> 02:30:46.440
remember Mr Lincoln farmer,
the band off,
they had the,

2497
02:30:46.441 --> 02:30:50.120
they were one of the first bands to use a synthesizer and he would get the

2498
02:30:50.121 --> 02:30:55.121
frequency down so low that your average stereo wasn't able to handle it.

2499
02:30:55.911 --> 02:30:59.880
So,
and they cranked it.
They would nail that,

2500
02:30:59.920 --> 02:31:02.210
that sucker and it sounded fucking great.

2501
02:31:02.211 --> 02:31:06.020
We all waited for that one part because the Cynthia would go so low,

2502
02:31:06.580 --> 02:31:11.300
but very often if the thing was turned up loud enough,
that needle would jump.

2503
02:31:11.570 --> 02:31:14.650
So you'd have to put a dime on,
on the,
on the,
what happens happened,

2504
02:31:14.651 --> 02:31:16.910
you put a quarter was too slow while it would,
it would,

2505
02:31:16.911 --> 02:31:21.670
where your record out pretty fast,
you know?
And uh,
and then that would,
uh,

2506
02:31:22.080 --> 02:31:23.940
I mean you didn't do it too often,
you know,

2507
02:31:23.941 --> 02:31:27.900
but everybody would wait for that one sound because it was new and nobody heard

2508
02:31:27.901 --> 02:31:28.734
that before.

2509
02:31:28.850 --> 02:31:31.520
<v 2>It's a great idea that they charge a dollar to get into because it's kind of</v>

2510
02:31:31.521 --> 02:31:33.590
symbolic because it's not a lot of money,

2511
02:31:34.010 --> 02:31:37.580
but it's enough money that people would be like,
if they're just walking by like,

2512
02:31:37.860 --> 02:31:39.590
yeah,
I'm not paying a dollar to go ahead.

2513
02:31:39.700 --> 02:31:42.130
<v 1>What's store?
Tiny place.
Yeah.
I mean it's just,</v>

2514
02:31:42.400 --> 02:31:45.490
it's like twice as big as this really tiny,

2515
02:31:45.590 --> 02:31:50.520
<v 2>no,
Quintin Tarantino is a pushing back on digital.
Like he,</v>

2516
02:31:50.521 --> 02:31:53.600
he thinks that everything should be still shot in film because he thinks there's

2517
02:31:53.601 --> 02:31:58.430
a quality to film to a movie that you're missing when you're shooting everything

2518
02:31:58.431 --> 02:32:01.250
in four k and HD and all this jazz.

2519
02:32:01.860 --> 02:32:02.800
<v 1>Well,
I think that has,</v>

2520
02:32:02.801 --> 02:32:06.240
it has something to do with depth of field and that kind of thing.
And again,

2521
02:32:06.480 --> 02:32:10.890
they're working on that with the software,
you know,
and uh,

2522
02:32:11.160 --> 02:32:13.180
because you know,
the,
again,

2523
02:32:14.060 --> 02:32:16.600
as the instruments get better and the,

2524
02:32:16.601 --> 02:32:19.690
the gigs get more gigs and all that,
there's,

2525
02:32:19.720 --> 02:32:24.450
there's more room for the software to work.
So,
um,
um,

2526
02:32:25.200 --> 02:32:28.510
you know,
but I,
I just believe,
you know,
like when,

2527
02:32:28.511 --> 02:32:31.740
when I look at a movie that I know it was done on film,
on,
you know,

2528
02:32:31.741 --> 02:32:35.250
like the high,
high quality cameras,
there's just something about it.

2529
02:32:35.251 --> 02:32:39.780
When you look back at it and it looks,
there's a,
I dunno,
there's a warmth to it,

2530
02:32:39.900 --> 02:32:43.020
you know,
that,
that you don't get from a,
I mean,

2531
02:32:43.021 --> 02:32:46.120
sometimes if you have a watch to like a,
like an HD movie on,

2532
02:32:46.121 --> 02:32:50.160
on a certain TV and it almost feels too,
too good,

2533
02:32:50.780 --> 02:32:54.600
you know,
and they didn't,
they didn't,
I mean,

2534
02:32:54.601 --> 02:32:57.350
it was like one of those crossover films where they,
they,

2535
02:32:57.370 --> 02:33:01.140
they wanted to jump into HD too quick or something and they didn't,

2536
02:33:01.170 --> 02:33:02.700
didn't take into account that,

2537
02:33:02.701 --> 02:33:06.450
that it's going to be played on these TVs that are going to show the lack,

2538
02:33:06.660 --> 02:33:09.120
lack of the depths of field that it feels like the,

2539
02:33:09.750 --> 02:33:12.330
there's something wrong when you're watching it.
You know what I mean?

2540
02:33:12.331 --> 02:33:15.950
Everything is too clear.
And,
uh,
it takes away from it.

2541
02:33:15.951 --> 02:33:19.410
And I can think of a couple of movies that will like that,
but,
you know,

2542
02:33:19.411 --> 02:33:24.080
they've obviously cleaned it up and,
uh,
I don't see too many,
uh,

2543
02:33:24.430 --> 02:33:29.340
examples of that anymore.
But,
uh,
a couple of years ago I noticed that and um,

2544
02:33:29.460 --> 02:33:34.380
you know,
my wife and I'd be watching a t a new TV in a,
in a hotel and it would,

2545
02:33:35.330 --> 02:33:38.970
and it just wouldn't look right now.
And you knew,
you know,
that it was shot.

2546
02:33:39.420 --> 02:33:42.630
It might've been shot at and,
and I mean in HD and,

2547
02:33:42.850 --> 02:33:47.010
and I dunno mixed in was with film.
I don't know.

2548
02:33:47.130 --> 02:33:50.820
<v 2>I think a lot of it is actually really high definition televisions,</v>

2549
02:33:50.910 --> 02:33:54.840
watching old films.
That's probably it.
Like Blue Ray,

2550
02:33:54.870 --> 02:33:58.170
if you get a video on blue ray that wasn't shot on Blu Ray,

2551
02:33:58.440 --> 02:34:03.090
like a aliens too is a perfect example that James Cameron version of alien,

2552
02:34:03.760 --> 02:34:04.620
the second movie,

2553
02:34:05.310 --> 02:34:09.870
there's a scene when they're in this hangar and there's a spaceship behind them

2554
02:34:10.140 --> 02:34:14.790
and it's painted spaceships painted and it looks like uttered dog shit.

2555
02:34:15.330 --> 02:34:18.610
Like when you saw it in the movie theater,
it was in film.
So it was,

2556
02:34:19.030 --> 02:34:22.510
even though it was ridiculous,
I'm sure in real life,
the way it looked,

2557
02:34:22.511 --> 02:34:26.590
the grainy aspect of it and film in a regular standard definition movie,

2558
02:34:26.591 --> 02:34:28.480
it looked great.
Right.
No problem.
At all,

2559
02:34:28.481 --> 02:34:31.330
but once they transferred it to blue ray,
you look at how you like,

2560
02:34:31.331 --> 02:34:34.470
what am I seeing?
This is a stupid looking.

2561
02:34:34.600 --> 02:34:38.920
<v 1>So many,
so many newscasters,
uh,
you know,</v>

2562
02:34:38.980 --> 02:34:43.750
men and women have lost their jobs when HD came out because did the,
you know,

2563
02:34:43.751 --> 02:34:46.860
the wrinkles,
all of a sudden every spot rehab,

2564
02:34:47.800 --> 02:34:48.880
two actors

2565
02:34:50.480 --> 02:34:54.600
<v 2>on news radio,
we'd shot everything in film on a Sitcom,</v>

2566
02:34:54.960 --> 02:34:59.960
but they started doing it that like that around that era,

2567
02:35:00.271 --> 02:35:03.810
like in Newsradio started in 94,
I think,
or 95.

2568
02:35:04.110 --> 02:35:09.060
And in that era was when things started shifting over to tape and they had a

2569
02:35:09.061 --> 02:35:13.140
process where they would take a film or take tape,

2570
02:35:13.320 --> 02:35:17.700
digital tape and convert it to like a film look.
Right?

2571
02:35:17.730 --> 02:35:21.570
They made it shittier looking essentially to make it look more like film.

2572
02:35:21.571 --> 02:35:24.450
Because when you looked at things through digital tape,

2573
02:35:24.451 --> 02:35:27.720
it was just unforgiving and it showed everything,
right?
Like instead of like,

2574
02:35:27.721 --> 02:35:31.770
if I'm filming you,
I'm focusing on you and the background is kind of blurry,

2575
02:35:31.771 --> 02:35:34.860
but I see your face,
right?
Digital just captures everything in front of you.

2576
02:35:34.861 --> 02:35:38.760
So you have to sort of like fuck with it after the fact to make it look like

2577
02:35:38.761 --> 02:35:39.420
film.
Right.

2578
02:35:39.420 --> 02:35:44.040
Cause otherwise like those fake two dimensional backdrops that they use for

2579
02:35:44.041 --> 02:35:47.610
artificial cities.
Like if you go to 20th century Fox and he walked down the lot,

2580
02:35:47.780 --> 02:35:49.950
he see us,
they look like shit in real life.

2581
02:35:50.180 --> 02:35:52.440
Like how has anybody fucking think this is really a city?

2582
02:35:52.710 --> 02:35:56.810
But in film you're only focusing on the actress face and the background is on

2583
02:35:56.811 --> 02:35:59.890
almost inconsequential.
You can get away with it.
Well that's,

2584
02:35:59.980 --> 02:36:04.000
they were kind of doing that.
But if you saw it before they converted it,

2585
02:36:04.001 --> 02:36:05.550
it looked like total dog shit.

2586
02:36:05.650 --> 02:36:08.650
<v 1>Right.
And that,
you know,
they've,
they're constantly,</v>

2587
02:36:09.040 --> 02:36:12.430
I mean every month it gets better and better and better.
And the same thing.

2588
02:36:12.490 --> 02:36:16.330
I mean what's,
what music is the same thing there.
There's still,
you know,

2589
02:36:16.360 --> 02:36:21.360
there and there are plugins that that will replicate tape even.

2590
02:36:22.720 --> 02:36:24.440
And then there's this,
this other thing that,

2591
02:36:25.180 --> 02:36:28.420
I don't know how long it's gonna last cause it's kind of a pain in the ass to

2592
02:36:28.421 --> 02:36:33.070
use,
but it actually goes from,
the signal actually goes from the microphone,

2593
02:36:33.071 --> 02:36:35.710
which is the singing or play in or whatever.

2594
02:36:36.160 --> 02:36:38.950
But it goes from the microphone right into,
uh,

2595
02:36:39.040 --> 02:36:44.040
a tape machine that like an old fashioned 24 track tape machine that's running.

2596
02:36:44.800 --> 02:36:47.230
And then it goes from there into the computer.

2597
02:36:47.470 --> 02:36:52.180
So it's almost like the tape is being used as a,
as a piece of outboard gear,

2598
02:36:52.210 --> 02:36:56.380
like a,
like a fuzz tone or an echo machine or something like that.
It's,

2599
02:36:56.381 --> 02:37:00.400
but it's going through tape before it hits that.
So,
uh,

2600
02:37:00.430 --> 02:37:04.300
so that warms it up automatically in a way that,
that it's,

2601
02:37:05.020 --> 02:37:08.050
it's really hard to duplicate,
you know,
with software.

2602
02:37:08.080 --> 02:37:12.160
So that's something that has been around for a couple of years.

2603
02:37:12.161 --> 02:37:16.460
They perfected it.
We've recorded our last record using it.
I don't know if it,

2604
02:37:16.700 --> 02:37:20.570
if it made it better or worse,
but um,
um,

2605
02:37:21.410 --> 02:37:24.410
and I don't know how much longer it will be around cause it is kind of a pain

2606
02:37:24.440 --> 02:37:26.840
because you've got to keep rewinding the tape,
you know,

2607
02:37:26.841 --> 02:37:31.160
every time you do a take and that kind of thing.
So,
uh,
um,

2608
02:37:31.700 --> 02:37:33.110
I don't know.
Dunno.
They're constantly,

2609
02:37:33.111 --> 02:37:37.250
I mean people are aware of it and they're constantly trying to upgrade it.
But,

2610
02:37:37.310 --> 02:37:38.630
um,
I don't know.

2611
02:37:38.631 --> 02:37:42.140
Somehow every time I listened to vinyl and there's something about the sound

2612
02:37:42.141 --> 02:37:44.330
that,
that,
uh,
I still like,

2613
02:37:44.570 --> 02:37:46.400
<v 2>it's compelling,
right?
There's something,</v>

2614
02:37:46.670 --> 02:37:50.520
there's something organic about it that seems to be what it is.
Like the,
the,

2615
02:37:50.530 --> 02:37:54.680
the expression warm seems to be like the,
the,
even the term warm,

2616
02:37:54.681 --> 02:37:58.970
it's like it's a living thing.
It's like a lie.
Whereas digital's cold.
Yeah.

2617
02:37:59.000 --> 02:38:01.610
Digital is like uncaring.
It's numbers.

2618
02:38:01.611 --> 02:38:05.810
It's ones and Zeros compressed and,
exactly.
And that's it.

2619
02:38:05.900 --> 02:38:08.920
That's like simple as that.
Analogous to our culture,
right?

2620
02:38:09.140 --> 02:38:14.140
There's the blow back against the sort of like harsh digital environment that

2621
02:38:14.751 --> 02:38:16.700
we're living in this,
this,

2622
02:38:16.701 --> 02:38:21.701
this slow descent into this fucking computer world that we're eventually going

2623
02:38:22.731 --> 02:38:25.460
to find ourselves living in and they know chips in our brain.

2624
02:38:25.600 --> 02:38:29.940
<v 1>I know it's a,
it's kind of funny when you hand somebody cash,
you know,</v>

2625
02:38:29.950 --> 02:38:32.600
where do you go in to buy something and it's like,
what is it?

2626
02:38:32.620 --> 02:38:35.950
What do I do with this?
You know,
it's like,
especially if it's over $5.

2627
02:38:36.480 --> 02:38:40.860
<v 2>These are a place that I used to eat at in the valley called chicks and it was
a,</v>

2628
02:38:40.861 --> 02:38:44.370
a,
a chicken place that had been around for like 20 plus years.

2629
02:38:44.790 --> 02:38:47.970
Old School is fuck.
This guy had invented his own rotisserie.

2630
02:38:47.971 --> 02:38:52.130
He had like an oven that was a wood fired oven and the guy who worked there and

2631
02:38:52.150 --> 02:38:56.880
to constantly throw wood into this oven and it was as big like copper on the,

2632
02:38:56.920 --> 02:39:00.840
I took you to chicks before,
right?
Fucking great,
right?
How good was that place?

2633
02:39:01.080 --> 02:39:04.290
They went under and they went under because the dude would not accept credit

2634
02:39:04.291 --> 02:39:08.010
cards,
really never accepted credit cards.
Want a cash only and you would,

2635
02:39:08.011 --> 02:39:10.020
people would go there and they would get pissed.

2636
02:39:10.200 --> 02:39:12.780
They would have their credit card out,
they would have an order,

2637
02:39:12.990 --> 02:39:15.720
they would say sorry.
And there's a sign right by the register cash only.

2638
02:39:16.370 --> 02:39:19.410
And they'd go,
I have a credit card and be the guy.
We're like,
sorry,

2639
02:39:19.411 --> 02:39:22.710
we only accept cash.
And they get mad at him and she hadn't storm out of there.

2640
02:39:22.770 --> 02:39:24.660
Really?
They didn't want people to,

2641
02:39:24.661 --> 02:39:28.320
some people that just want to just walk around with a credit card and nothing

2642
02:39:28.321 --> 02:39:31.680
else.
And this guy was like,
you don't have fuck credit cards.
I want cash.

2643
02:39:31.950 --> 02:39:36.030
And so it,
uh,
for whatever reason,
it slowly started killing his business.

2644
02:39:36.340 --> 02:39:39.750
The guy refused to adapt.
He was old school is fuck.
And eventually 100.

2645
02:39:39.751 --> 02:39:41.850
Now it's a Starbucks.
Jesus.

2646
02:39:42.760 --> 02:39:47.740
<v 1>Unbelievable.
That's a drag because it's like,
Eh,
you know,
I mean,</v>

2647
02:39:48.070 --> 02:39:52.600
that's an hour to cook chicken.
Really.
Whoa.
You know,

2648
02:39:52.601 --> 02:39:56.510
and you know,
it's like,
it is a true art and,
uh,
to,

2649
02:39:56.540 --> 02:39:58.630
to see that go down.
That's really a drag.

2650
02:39:58.730 --> 02:40:00.320
<v 2>They cooked everything.
They're really good.</v>

2651
02:40:00.321 --> 02:40:04.370
It wasn't just chicken that fantastic sandwiches.
They had the best Pastrami.

2652
02:40:05.070 --> 02:40:08.840
I mean it was a Mexican place.
They had pastrami.
I mean,
Mexicans owned it.

2653
02:40:08.841 --> 02:40:13.020
It was amazing.
This place is just fucking fantastic.
And they,

2654
02:40:13.290 --> 02:40:14.250
whatever reason,

2655
02:40:14.280 --> 02:40:17.340
they just refuse to give in and they eventually closed the doors.

2656
02:40:17.610 --> 02:40:19.860
<v 1>That's a drag.
I know.
I mean,</v>

2657
02:40:19.861 --> 02:40:22.950
I've gone to restaurants and you know,
some,

2658
02:40:23.340 --> 02:40:26.430
cause I'm always looking for barbecue places,
you know,
you know,

2659
02:40:26.510 --> 02:40:29.160
and in our travels and,
and they'll,
there's,

2660
02:40:29.460 --> 02:40:32.730
there are a lot of places that they just do cash and you guys can be in you.

2661
02:40:32.731 --> 02:40:34.560
It can be annoying sometimes when you don't,

2662
02:40:34.590 --> 02:40:39.150
when you don't have any cash on you and you just find out when you walk in the

2663
02:40:39.151 --> 02:40:42.840
door,
you know,
so I can see what,
but you know,

2664
02:40:43.280 --> 02:40:45.790
if your business is spreading like that,
you gotta like get,

2665
02:40:45.810 --> 02:40:48.330
get the word out there so people come prepared,
you know?

2666
02:40:48.500 --> 02:40:52.200
<v 2>Have you ever been to doctor [inaudible] and Van Eyes?
No.
Oh,</v>

2667
02:40:53.300 --> 02:40:57.800
Joe Perry.
It might be the best fucking barbecue in the country.
Really.

2668
02:40:59.170 --> 02:41:01.510
<v 1>Well,
you've got to get a tall,
tall order.</v>

2669
02:41:01.850 --> 02:41:05.010
<v 2>Talon you,
I'm telling you,
I'm,
I've been to a lot of spots.</v>

2670
02:41:05.280 --> 02:41:07.710
I've been to some fantastic spots in North Carolina.

2671
02:41:07.711 --> 02:41:10.560
I've been to some awesome joints in Texas and in Georgia.

2672
02:41:10.950 --> 02:41:15.720
This fucking spot in Van Nuys,
California might be the best joint in the country.

2673
02:41:16.140 --> 02:41:19.620
It seems ridiculous as Detroit neighborhood.
True.
Oh,

2674
02:41:19.860 --> 02:41:22.500
it's right down the street from one of the dirtiest strip clubs in the valley.

2675
02:41:22.760 --> 02:41:27.480
But if you go down Supolvida and you,
you,
you find this place,

2676
02:41:27.481 --> 02:41:31.590
Dr Hoggy Walkleys Tyler,
Texas barbecue in Van Nuys.
Really?

2677
02:41:31.620 --> 02:41:34.410
It's sensational.
They have the best brisket I've ever eaten in my life.

2678
02:41:34.440 --> 02:41:35.700
It's one melts in your mouth

2679
02:41:36.160 --> 02:41:39.620
<v 1>than this.
I'm into brisket now.
I've been kind of,
I was into,</v>

2680
02:41:39.760 --> 02:41:42.600
into baby backs for awhile and then,
um,

2681
02:41:43.020 --> 02:41:47.790
kind of going back and forth,
but,
but brisket is now my,
you know,

2682
02:41:47.890 --> 02:41:52.180
<v 2>if you like risky,
you must go to this place.
They have,
it's old school.</v>

2683
02:41:52.181 --> 02:41:56.260
They have fucking that shitty fake wood on the walls.
What's that called?

2684
02:41:56.290 --> 02:41:56.530
You know,

2685
02:41:56.530 --> 02:41:59.860
that wood paneling that you see in people's basements when the molesting kids?

2686
02:42:00.710 --> 02:42:05.350
Well,
like you seen all those American apparel ads,
you know,
it's that shit.

2687
02:42:05.560 --> 02:42:07.720
It's on the wall.
It's fuck the,
the,
the,
the,

2688
02:42:07.721 --> 02:42:11.250
they should have just fucking bare walls.
Who gives a shit,
right?
The,
the,

2689
02:42:11.260 --> 02:42:15.600
the wall,
the,
the decorations.
It's almost indicative.
Oh,
is that photos of it?

2690
02:42:15.601 --> 02:42:18.190
And then is a video of it.
Oh,
this is a video of [inaudible].

2691
02:42:18.210 --> 02:42:22.510
I am telling you this fucking portions are incredible.

2692
02:42:22.570 --> 02:42:23.920
They're huge portions.

2693
02:42:24.520 --> 02:42:29.290
I always get the brisket hotlinks and a pork rib.
That's what I get.

2694
02:42:29.690 --> 02:42:33.220
Spare ribs to.
Fucking ridiculously good.

2695
02:42:33.610 --> 02:42:36.690
Ridiculously good.
I'm not,
I,

2696
02:42:37.120 --> 02:42:40.780
I have no affiliation with these people.
I don't,
I go there all the time.

2697
02:42:40.781 --> 02:42:44.260
I don't know anybody who owns it.
Um,
did not trying to make any money here.

2698
02:42:44.261 --> 02:42:46.440
I'm telling you,
I,
I'm fucking up right now.

2699
02:42:46.460 --> 02:42:49.450
Shouldn't be telling you people about it because it's going to be a God damn

2700
02:42:49.451 --> 02:42:49.751
line.

2701
02:42:49.751 --> 02:42:53.940
All these hipsters are going to find out about this spot and swarm van eyes.
No,

2702
02:42:53.941 --> 02:42:54.260
just,

2703
02:42:54.260 --> 02:42:58.450
<v 1>just tell him,
keep,
keep,
keep drumming on the neighborhood.
How funky it.</v>

2704
02:42:59.310 --> 02:43:02.010
<v 2>Funky as fuck.
It's,
it's very funky.</v>

2705
02:43:02.220 --> 02:43:05.400
It's one of those places where you park your car and you're like,
okay,

2706
02:43:05.450 --> 02:43:07.250
hope it's still here when I get back.
Huh?

2707
02:43:07.560 --> 02:43:09.620
<v 1>Yeah.
They used to be a place like that.
And Boston,</v>

2708
02:43:09.630 --> 02:43:12.100
I remember we used to go at four the morning,
you know,

2709
02:43:12.110 --> 02:43:13.600
<v 0>um,
the same thing.</v>

2710
02:43:13.690 --> 02:43:17.700
And they used to do a ham hocks and it was,

2711
02:43:17.890 --> 02:43:21.880
that was a great,
you know,
and it hard to find a good ham hocks.
Yeah,
yeah.

2712
02:43:22.720 --> 02:43:24.040
With hamhocks.
Yeah.

2713
02:43:24.280 --> 02:43:28.000
I didn't find a good spot and I was had to do that and Chitlins and all thing

2714
02:43:28.001 --> 02:43:32.230
then.
And we used to go down there and I mean,
and it was,
but you know,

2715
02:43:32.320 --> 02:43:37.120
everybody made a straight line there and you know,
got left alone.

2716
02:43:37.240 --> 02:43:41.380
It was fine.
They're good neighborhood place.
Well there's a place in Austin,

2717
02:43:41.381 --> 02:43:44.380
Texas that has a famous for its weight.

2718
02:43:44.830 --> 02:43:47.770
It's got like an hour and a half wait.
Like everywhere you go,

2719
02:43:48.040 --> 02:43:51.700
every time you go there,
like in the morning when they're opening up for lunch,

2720
02:43:51.810 --> 02:43:55.030
it was a fucking line of people already waiting to get in there because Austin,

2721
02:43:55.031 --> 02:43:58.870
Texas is one of those places where people find out about a spot and it becomes

2722
02:43:58.871 --> 02:44:00.220
like the place to wait in line.

2723
02:44:00.410 --> 02:44:02.800
Like I went there a couple of weeks ago and there was this line for this

2724
02:44:02.801 --> 02:44:06.400
hamburger place.
I'm like,
it's a fucking hamburger place.

2725
02:44:06.550 --> 02:44:10.060
How good could it be?
But there's an hour and a half wait,
align.

2726
02:44:10.150 --> 02:44:13.000
Like what are you doing to your hamburgers unless you put in cocaine on your

2727
02:44:13.001 --> 02:44:15.820
hamburgers?
I'm understand this line,
it doesn't make any sense,

2728
02:44:16.210 --> 02:44:20.980
but there's a huge fucking lime for this,
you know,
handcrafted,
right?

2729
02:44:21.060 --> 02:44:25.210
It'll,
the only way to spot crafted is if you can see the cows in the back.

2730
02:44:25.420 --> 02:44:29.530
You know what I mean?
And he's,
then you know where it's coming from.

2731
02:44:29.590 --> 02:44:31.990
I just don't know how it could be much better than in and out.

2732
02:44:32.160 --> 02:44:35.320
And now you just get in the car and you'd go through the drive through and it's

2733
02:44:35.500 --> 02:44:37.570
pretty much fucking perfect.

2734
02:44:38.180 --> 02:44:43.160
<v 3>My favorite place in La,
uh,
lowest weight I've ever had was three hours boiling.</v>

2735
02:44:43.250 --> 02:44:46.390
It's called boiling crab and it's actually the mop.
It's,

2736
02:44:46.391 --> 02:44:50.920
it's where they take crab and they put sausage in it and then then like corn and

2737
02:44:50.921 --> 02:44:54.020
then butter and garlic.
And he'd just give it to you in a huge bag.

2738
02:44:54.470 --> 02:44:57.170
And they have crawfish,
lobster,
whatever you want.

2739
02:44:57.171 --> 02:44:59.900
But everything comes in big bags.
That's three hour wait,

2740
02:45:00.110 --> 02:45:04.460
that's the lowest I've ever been.
I had it up to five hours before.
Come on.
Yeah.

2741
02:45:04.470 --> 02:45:09.440
And you literally sign up and they'd say like four hours and then you just leave

2742
02:45:09.500 --> 02:45:12.200
and you come back like three and a half hours later.

2743
02:45:12.201 --> 02:45:13.580
And hopefully they didn't call your name.

2744
02:45:14.840 --> 02:45:19.390
It's due to most people actually wait.
Yeah,
it's,
it's,

2745
02:45:19.391 --> 02:45:24.020
it's just groups of people like all sitting in a parking lot outside.
It's weird,

2746
02:45:24.380 --> 02:45:27.650
but there's,
there's generic rip off places now because they've,

2747
02:45:27.950 --> 02:45:31.520
so many people come,
you know,
love that place.
So now there's like boiling shrimp,

2748
02:45:31.521 --> 02:45:35.240
which is the exact copy of it.
And it's,
there's no,
wait,

2749
02:45:35.360 --> 02:45:38.180
where's this place I la hombre.

2750
02:45:39.090 --> 02:45:42.910
And there's one in Korea town and there's one in Texas.
Those,

2751
02:45:42.940 --> 02:45:44.950
a bunch of these and they're all our,

2752
02:45:44.970 --> 02:45:49.970
our weights know was great except for the weight.

2753
02:45:50.920 --> 02:45:51.440
Yeah.

2754
02:45:51.440 --> 02:45:55.010
<v 0>Yeah.
Well it's nice when someone figures out something good.
You know,</v>

2755
02:45:55.011 --> 02:45:57.050
like one of the things that you're seeing now at lax,

2756
02:45:57.260 --> 02:46:01.460
lax used to be just like Chili's and like burger king,
it was like,
Ooh,

2757
02:46:01.670 --> 02:46:06.200
well chains.
But now they have all these like cool restaurants there.

2758
02:46:06.201 --> 02:46:09.410
They have like really good restaurants and a lot of the terminals now they

2759
02:46:09.411 --> 02:46:13.880
finally figured out like,
Jesus Christ,
we have people coming in here every day,

2760
02:46:13.910 --> 02:46:18.290
guaranteed packed every day and you've got all these shitty chain restaurants.

2761
02:46:18.291 --> 02:46:21.740
But they've finally,
again,
the same sort of thing,
these blowback,
right.

2762
02:46:21.950 --> 02:46:24.350
Where there,
you know,
people would saying,
you know enough already,

2763
02:46:24.351 --> 02:46:26.180
let's put in a good restaurant,
see what happens.

2764
02:46:26.181 --> 02:46:30.230
And it takes off like wildfire and he sees big lines and these nice restaurants

2765
02:46:30.231 --> 02:46:32.750
at lax.
Yeah.
People,

2766
02:46:32.751 --> 02:46:37.751
you could see people going there without having to take off,

2767
02:46:37.780 --> 02:46:40.250
you know,
and just go there to eat.
Yeah.

2768
02:46:40.280 --> 02:46:42.990
But you'd have to go through security license.

2769
02:46:43.040 --> 02:46:46.430
It's on the other side of you would have to like buy a ticket,

2770
02:46:46.431 --> 02:46:47.510
but that's really smart.

2771
02:46:48.230 --> 02:46:51.560
We imagine if you buy a ticket for like southwest where it's not that expensive

2772
02:46:51.670 --> 02:46:53.090
so you can only get to go through.

2773
02:46:53.091 --> 02:46:56.150
I like to go through security as soon as they get there,
get it over with,

2774
02:46:56.210 --> 02:46:58.820
you know what I mean?
So it's good.
It's on the other side.
Yeah.

2775
02:46:58.821 --> 02:47:01.970
They don't have anything on the inside that you can't buy anything.
Right.

2776
02:47:01.971 --> 02:47:03.950
They don't it lax.
Did they have any,

2777
02:47:03.951 --> 02:47:08.090
they have a Starbucks at the the baggage claim place,

2778
02:47:08.091 --> 02:47:11.780
but that's basically it.
Yeah.
Boston has a bunch of those at Logan.

2779
02:47:11.810 --> 02:47:15.050
There's a few places you can eat before you go through security.
Yeah,

2780
02:47:15.230 --> 02:47:19.160
but I don't think they have any of that in la except the restaurant that's

2781
02:47:19.161 --> 02:47:23.620
actually outside that.
Right.
Whatever that spaceship looking thing.
Nope.

2782
02:47:23.710 --> 02:47:27.710
You know?
No,
it looks like you know what is probably pay a painting.

2783
02:47:28.040 --> 02:47:33.040
I know nobody's ever eaten in the CIA operation just to get the fucking really?

2784
02:47:34.850 --> 02:47:38.840
Yeah.
There you go,
man.
You never know.
You never know.
Listen,

2785
02:47:38.841 --> 02:47:42.860
Joe Perry were based basically out of time.
You're fucking awesome man.
Really.

2786
02:47:43.070 --> 02:47:45.540
So cool to have you on here.
I appreciate the fuck out of it.

2787
02:47:46.220 --> 02:47:50.370
Great to meet you and be on the show.
And you know,
like I said,
it was more,

2788
02:47:50.810 --> 02:47:54.880
more important to hook up with you then,
but it was great to be on a podcast.

2789
02:47:55.350 --> 02:47:58.340
You do a great job.
Thank you brother.
I appreciate it very much,
man.

2790
02:47:58.341 --> 02:48:03.100
It's an honor,
the true honor.
And uh,
then I got to my boys,
you know,

2791
02:48:03.110 --> 02:48:07.820
turned me on to a while ago and it was,
you know,
it was great.
Yeah.
Thank you sir.

2792
02:48:08.150 --> 02:48:10.910
Let's do it again sometime.
Yeah,
tell me when you're back in town again.

2793
02:48:11.360 --> 02:48:14.950
I got to come see you guys live to do you,
when are you guys performing live?
Uh,

2794
02:48:14.960 --> 02:48:17.790
well we just finished being on the road for awhile,

2795
02:48:17.840 --> 02:48:20.890
so we're gonna probably go out again next year.
You know,

2796
02:48:20.930 --> 02:48:23.690
it's going to be a while.
So sometime in 2015 yeah,

2797
02:48:23.840 --> 02:48:26.360
we'll come back on what next time before you're going to do it and we'll,

2798
02:48:26.810 --> 02:48:29.990
we'll set something up.
All right,
cool.
Beautiful.
Thank you,
sir.
Joe Perry,

2799
02:48:29.991 --> 02:48:32.150
Ladies and gentlemen,
John [inaudible] on Twitter,

2800
02:48:32.151 --> 02:48:33.710
but he doesn't need you to pay attention to him.

2801
02:48:34.040 --> 02:48:37.520
Go fucking check out of the scope by his book.
God dammit.
Let's,

2802
02:48:37.521 --> 02:48:39.020
let's bump that bitch up to number one.

2803
02:48:39.180 --> 02:48:41.870
It's the last time I saw it was number four.
What's the name of the book again?

2804
02:48:42.170 --> 02:48:45.700
It's called Bronx,
my life in and out of Aerosmith.

2805
02:48:46.030 --> 02:48:50.060
Joe Perry lays gentlemen.
Nuff said night.
See you soon.

2806
02:49:03.680 --> 02:49:04.513
<v 6>Okay.</v>

2807
02:49:12.780 --> 02:49:12.990
<v 4>Yeah.</v>
