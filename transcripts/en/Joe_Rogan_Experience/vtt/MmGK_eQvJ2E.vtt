12
00:00:23.971 --> 00:00:25.320
<v Speaker 1>it just seemed to illegal.</v>

<v Speaker 1>And then they start showing like testimonials like of people and they're like,</v>

21
00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:36.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

22
00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:37.950
<v Speaker 1>I sent in my,</v>

23
00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.720
<v Speaker 1>or I read the letters and then just a week later I got a new house and a car and</v>

24
00:00:42.721 --> 00:00:43.710
<v Speaker 1>then the next person was like,</v>

25
00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:46.730
<v Speaker 1>I got $200,000 and then there's other ones,</v>

26
00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.160
<v Speaker 1>like a guy just walked up and gave me a check for $15 million.</v>

27
00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:50.850
<v Speaker 1>And it was,</v>

28
00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.620
<v Speaker 1>it was like the most fake as shit ever.</v>

29
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.730
<v Speaker 1>And so then I started really researching this guy and there's all these videos</v>

30
00:00:56.731 --> 00:00:57.600
<v Speaker 1>about him online,</v>

31
00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.990
<v Speaker 1>I guess he's been ripping people off for a long time,</v>

32
00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.740
<v Speaker 1>and one of the best videos is one where he just goes up and he goes,</v>

33
00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.280
<v Speaker 1>where's we're so Ansel,</v>

75
00:02:04.081 --> 00:02:05.850
<v Speaker 2>then somewhere along the line they,</v>

76
00:02:05.851 --> 00:02:06.090
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

77
00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.620
<v Speaker 2>they realized that they could sell things and they started like selling like</v>

78
00:02:10.621 --> 00:02:14.720
<v Speaker 2>holy water and selling like prayer services and,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'll never forget this one thing that he said.</v>

121
00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.931
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

122
00:03:28.931 --> 00:03:30.460
<v Speaker 2>every time you write a check to me,</v>

<v Speaker 2>But it doesn't,</v>

126
00:03:36.161 --> 00:03:39.580
<v Speaker 2>part of you think that if you're dumb enough to to send him that money,</v>

127
00:03:39.581 --> 00:03:39.881
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

130
00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:45.490
<v Speaker 2>Like you really thought that money was going to gone.</v>

131
00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.890
<v Speaker 2>You really thought that money is going to give the devil a black guy.</v>

132
00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:49.730
<v Speaker 2>If you really thought that you,</v>

133
00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.270
<v Speaker 2>you're fucking stupid and we're not looking after you.</v>

134
00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.760
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

135
00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.280
<v Speaker 1>One of the sky things that this Peter Popoff does,</v>

136
00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:59.150
<v Speaker 1>he also sends you a barley cake from,</v>

137
00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:02.390
<v Speaker 1>you know the Bible where it's like kind of like that little bread you eat.</v>

138
00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:03.430
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>

139
00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:03.710
<v Speaker 1>ah.</v>

140
00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:05.120
<v Speaker 1>He goes in this commercial,</v>

141
00:04:05.121 --> 00:04:09.830
<v Speaker 1>he goes and we make it with the exact ingredients that they say in the Bible and</v>

142
00:04:09.831 --> 00:04:09.981
<v Speaker 1>Blah,</v>

143
00:04:09.981 --> 00:04:10.191
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

144
00:04:10.191 --> 00:04:10.610
<v Speaker 1>blah.</v>

145
00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:14.390
<v Speaker 1>Well then if you look up his zeal for 12 in the Bible,</v>

146
00:04:14.391 --> 00:04:15.020

236
00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:43.370
<v Speaker 2>a great cloud and a fire enfolding itself in brightness was about it and out of</v>

237
00:06:45.391 --> 00:06:50.391
<v Speaker 2>the midst thereof as the color of amber out of the midst of the fire.</v>

238
00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:52.051
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:59.130
<v Speaker 2>Somebody putting two points together that don't go together.</v>

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:02.411
<v Speaker 2>Also,</v>

249
00:07:02.411 --> 00:07:06.880
<v Speaker 2>out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living creatures and this was</v>

250
00:07:06.881 --> 00:07:07.714
<v Speaker 2>their appearance.</v>

251
00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:10.660
<v Speaker 2>They had the likeness of a man woe.</v>

252
00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:13.860
<v Speaker 2>After everyone had four faces in,</v>

253
00:07:13.861 --> 00:07:18.820
<v Speaker 2>every one had four wings and their feet were straight and the sole of their feet</v>

254
00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:24.030
<v Speaker 2>was like the soul of a calf's foot and they sparkled like the color of burnished</v>

255
00:07:24.461 --> 00:07:25.294
<v Speaker 2>brass.</v>

256
00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:26.860
<v Speaker 2>What a trippy book.</v>

257
00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:27.701
<v Speaker 2>People are like,</v>

00:07:27.701 --> 00:07:28.091
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

259
00:07:28.091 --> 00:07:28.924
<v Speaker 2>it's so real.</v>

260
00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:31.450
<v Speaker 2>I hear God's words when you're saying these things,</v>

261
00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:33.460
<v Speaker 2>God is speaking to me through your words.</v>

262
00:07:33.461 --> 00:07:34.300
<v Speaker 2>Please run on.</v>

263
00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:39.540
<v Speaker 2>And they had the hands of men under their wings on their four sides and they</v>

264
00:07:39.671 --> 00:07:40.240
<v Speaker 2>had,</v>

265
00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:41.800
<v Speaker 2>and they four had their faces and their waste.</v>

266
00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:46.680
<v Speaker 2>Somebody might have just made all this up and me like an asshole as reading</v>

267
00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:50.970
<v Speaker 2>these fake Bible quotes shitting all over the Bible and the aliens.</v>

268
00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:51.730
<v Speaker 2>But guess what?</v>

269
00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:52.450

00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:54.460
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

273
00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:56.050

274
00:07:56.110 --> 00:07:59.080
<v Speaker 2>if this really is as he kills it says it is.</v>

275
00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:00.033
<v Speaker 2>God dammit.</v>

276
00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:00.940
<v Speaker 2>It's all nuttiness.</v>

277
00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:02.980
<v Speaker 2>They walked up with their four faces and they said,</v>

278
00:08:02.981 --> 00:08:05.200
<v Speaker 2>why are you guys cooking things in Shit?</v>

279
00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:07.160
<v Speaker 2>And the living creatures ran in,</v>

280
00:08:07.161 --> 00:08:09.850
<v Speaker 2>returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning.</v>

281
00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:11.050
<v Speaker 2>Now as I behold,</v>

282
00:08:11.051 --> 00:08:11.890
<v Speaker 2>the living creatures,</v>

283
00:08:11.891 --> 00:08:16.690
<v Speaker 2>behold one wheel upon the earth by the living creatures with his four faces.</v>
