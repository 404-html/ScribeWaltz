1
00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:02.910
<v Speaker 1>Her low freak bitches.</v>

2
00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:04.650
<v Speaker 1>Have you eaten polar bear?</v>

3
00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:05.191
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

4
00:00:05.191 --> 00:00:05.850
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>

5
00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:06.960
<v Speaker 1>What does polar bread tastes like?</v>

6
00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:08.880
<v Speaker 1>You know what I've eaten at?</v>

7
00:00:08.881 --> 00:00:10.290
<v Speaker 1>It's up in the Arctic with the annual it.</v>

8
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:11.190
<v Speaker 1>And so they,</v>

9
00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:12.960
<v Speaker 1>they boil everything.</v>

10
00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:14.720
<v Speaker 1>It's a boiled and,</v>

11
00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:15.583
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

12
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.400
<v Speaker 1>it's funny you put salt,</v>

13
00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:18.263
<v Speaker 1>lick the brisket.</v>

14
00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:20.520
<v Speaker 1>It normally where we need the backstraps,</v>

15
00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:21.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

16
00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.290
<v Speaker 1>that'd be the first choice or 10 wines,</v>

17
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:24.850
<v Speaker 1>the Inuit nod,</v>

18
00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:26.880
<v Speaker 1>it's the brisket because when you boil it,</v>

19
00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.090
<v Speaker 1>that's where you've got this great textures,</v>

20
00:00:30.091 --> 00:00:30.301
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

21
00:00:30.301 --> 00:00:31.290
<v Speaker 1>that they're crunchy.</v>

22
00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:32.071
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

23
00:00:32.071 --> 00:00:32.371
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

24
00:00:32.371 --> 00:00:35.730
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know what you'd call a cartilage and connective tissue.</v>

25
00:00:35.731 --> 00:00:37.260
<v Speaker 1>There's not just meat and fat.</v>

26
00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:38.420
<v Speaker 1>So that's the,</v>

27
00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:39.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

28
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.391
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

29
00:00:39.391 --> 00:00:40.141
<v Speaker 1>it was a delicacy.</v>

30
00:00:40.141 --> 00:00:43.440
<v Speaker 1>I would rate it right up there with the best of the meat I've ever had now</v>

31
00:00:43.441 --> 00:00:44.010
<v Speaker 1>Healy.</v>

32
00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:44.131
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

33
00:00:44.131 --> 00:00:44.964
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>

34
00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:48.270
<v Speaker 1>But boiled with salt and being very hungry out on the ice.</v>

35
00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:48.811
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

36
00:00:48.811 --> 00:00:51.040
<v Speaker 1>you spent 20 days out in the ice with annual it on a dog.</v>

37
00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:52.330
<v Speaker 1>Sledger you're hungry.</v>

38
00:00:52.331 --> 00:00:52.581
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

39
00:00:52.581 --> 00:00:52.951
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

40
00:00:52.951 --> 00:00:54.570
<v Speaker 1>they kill a barrier unit near,</v>

41
00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.530
<v Speaker 1>it's like the best finest Coby beef and downtown New York City.</v>

42
00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:01.920
<v Speaker 1>Is it relative to where you're at and the struggle that your enemy,</v>

43
00:01:01.921 --> 00:01:03.300
<v Speaker 1>if you had it in La,</v>

44
00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.530
<v Speaker 1>if I took it to a restaurant down the street and hard to say because there is no</v>

45
00:01:07.531 --> 00:01:08.320
<v Speaker 1>restaurant serves it,</v>

46
00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:09.780
<v Speaker 1>so it's hard to,</v>

47
00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.080
<v Speaker 1>hard to take it out of that context and say,</v>

48
00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:14.010
<v Speaker 1>is it the best meat?</v>

49
00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.940
<v Speaker 1>Now here,</v>

50
00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.020
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

51
00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.040
<v Speaker 1>I mean while cheap,</v>

52
00:01:17.041 --> 00:01:17.431
<v Speaker 1>same thing.</v>

53
00:01:17.431 --> 00:01:22.110
<v Speaker 1>You're on a mountain and you've been backpacking for 10 days carrying 50 to 70</v>

54
00:01:22.111 --> 00:01:27.090
<v Speaker 1>pounds on your back and you finally get you around and run down to below Alpine</v>

55
00:01:27.091 --> 00:01:30.060
<v Speaker 1>and find some little sticks and make a fire and roast the ribs on it.</v>

56
00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:35.510
<v Speaker 1>I defy anybody to tell me there's a better piece of meat in this world that</v>

57
00:01:35.571 --> 00:01:39.090
<v Speaker 1>tastes better than that wild sheep on a mountain after a sheep hunt.</v>

58
00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.890
<v Speaker 1>But would it be that good if I was downtown New York City or here in la?</v>

59
00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:45.301
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

60
00:01:45.301 --> 00:01:46.131
<v Speaker 1>I don't know because you,</v>

61
00:01:46.131 --> 00:01:47.730
<v Speaker 1>you just can't do it.</v>

62
00:01:47.731 --> 00:01:48.480
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't exist.</v>

63
00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.190
<v Speaker 1>One of the best meals I've ever had in my life.</v>

64
00:01:50.191 --> 00:01:51.450
<v Speaker 1>We shot a mule deer,</v>

65
00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:53.880
<v Speaker 1>that deer right there in Montana.</v>

66
00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.020
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

67
00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.550
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

68
00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:58.530
<v Speaker 1>we ate the liver and the heart of that night.</v>

69
00:01:58.720 --> 00:01:59.610
<v Speaker 1>It was insane.</v>

70
00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:01.530
<v Speaker 1>It was so delicious.</v>

71
00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.100
<v Speaker 1>That's the camp fire and just cooked it over oil with a little salt and pepper.</v>

72
00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.250
<v Speaker 1>And we were just moaning with delight like an orgy.</v>

73
00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:10.590
<v Speaker 1>Anyone that doesn't hunt,</v>

74
00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.980
<v Speaker 1>that isn't out there can never know what we're,</v>

75
00:02:13.981 --> 00:02:14.230
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

76
00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:15.090
<v Speaker 1>what you're describing.</v>

77
00:02:15.091 --> 00:02:15.924
<v Speaker 1>I know it.</v>

78
00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:16.793
<v Speaker 1>I know it.</v>

79
00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.300
<v Speaker 1>I've had the same thing and I've had,</v>

80
00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.571
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

81
00:02:18.571 --> 00:02:20.130
<v Speaker 1>Moose liver and name it,</v>

82
00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.521
<v Speaker 1>name it,</v>

83
00:02:20.521 --> 00:02:21.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

84
00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.070
<v Speaker 1>antelope all around the world.</v>

85
00:02:23.071 --> 00:02:23.940
<v Speaker 1>We've had the same thing.</v>

86
00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.280
<v Speaker 1>It's the best of the best.</v>

87
00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:27.360
<v Speaker 1>It's the perfect,</v>

88
00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.870
<v Speaker 1>I think it's because that's who we are.</v>

89
00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:31.831
<v Speaker 1>That's who we are.</v>

90
00:02:31.831 --> 00:02:31.941
<v Speaker 1>We're,</v>

91
00:02:31.941 --> 00:02:33.020
<v Speaker 1>we're not the,</v>

92
00:02:33.021 --> 00:02:34.770
<v Speaker 1>the fancy restaurant,</v>

93
00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:36.203
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

94
00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:41.250
<v Speaker 1>thousand dollar bottles of wine and whole whole wait cuisine is not what we are.</v>

95
00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.561
<v Speaker 1>We're,</v>

96
00:02:41.561 --> 00:02:42.394
<v Speaker 1>we're just,</v>

97
00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.390
<v Speaker 1>we're just that we eat wild game cooked on a fire.</v>

98
00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.831
<v Speaker 1>That's the truth.</v>

99
00:02:46.831 --> 00:02:47.311
<v Speaker 1>We can ever be.</v>

100
00:02:47.311 --> 00:02:48.210
<v Speaker 1>That's the truest,</v>

101
00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.130
<v Speaker 1>most natural flavor and,</v>

102
00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.460
<v Speaker 1>and eating that we could ever do.</v>

103
00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:54.271
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

104
00:02:54.271 --> 00:02:54.631
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

105
00:02:54.631 --> 00:02:55.171
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

106
00:02:55.171 --> 00:02:56.190
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting.</v>

107
00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:56.640
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

108
00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.440
<v Speaker 1>I don't have it gets stuck in your head,</v>

109
00:02:58.441 --> 00:02:59.650
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know either.</v>

110
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.903
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>

111
00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.411
<v Speaker 1>But it,</v>

112
00:03:01.411 --> 00:03:04.210
<v Speaker 1>it seems like a very likely scenario.</v>

113
00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.601
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

114
00:03:04.601 --> 00:03:05.140
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

115
00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.920
<v Speaker 1>the brain's functional and it's the most traumatic experience ever.</v>

116
00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:10.780
<v Speaker 1>And you don't have any context.</v>

117
00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:12.760
<v Speaker 1>Don't have any language.</v>

118
00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.570
<v Speaker 1>You don't have any knowledge of why you're there.</v>

119
00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:17.440
<v Speaker 1>No one's explained what's going to happen.</v>

120
00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:18.610
<v Speaker 1>All of a sudden you're born,</v>

121
00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:21.070
<v Speaker 1>that's gotta be unbelievably traumatic.</v>

122
00:03:21.071 --> 00:03:21.950
<v Speaker 1>You've been hearing this,</v>

123
00:03:21.951 --> 00:03:22.150
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

124
00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.983
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

125
00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.771
<v Speaker 2>hold on.</v>

126
00:03:24.771 --> 00:03:25.380
<v Speaker 2>Top of that.</v>

127
00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:26.490
<v Speaker 1>Add circumcision.</v>

128
00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:28.240
<v Speaker 1>And how about the apple?</v>

129
00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.290
<v Speaker 1>Slice your fucking Dick with a razor.</v>

130
00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:32.760
<v Speaker 1>Welcome home.</v>

131
00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.820
<v Speaker 1>Why you cut his dick?</v>

132
00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:36.480
<v Speaker 1>Wyatt,</v>

133
00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:37.231
<v Speaker 1>welcome to Earth.</v>

134
00:03:37.231 --> 00:03:38.820
<v Speaker 1>We're just going to let the kid be clean.</v>

135
00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:39.840
<v Speaker 1>What about soap?</v>

136
00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:41.043
<v Speaker 1>Anybody ever?</v>

137
00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:45.720
<v Speaker 1>Everybody we're talking about soap to cut his fucking Dick.</v>

138
00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:48.290
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

139
00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:49.051
<v Speaker 1>Hit screamings.</v>

140
00:03:49.051 --> 00:03:49.950
<v Speaker 1>Dick's on fire.</v>

141
00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:51.421
<v Speaker 1>Screaming.</v>

142
00:03:51.421 --> 00:03:52.310
<v Speaker 1>Just came out of a pussy.</v>

143
00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:53.400
<v Speaker 1>Dixon actually,</v>

144
00:03:53.401 --> 00:03:54.890
<v Speaker 1>how long do they wait for the circumstances?</v>

145
00:03:54.891 --> 00:03:55.830
<v Speaker 1>They probably don't do it right away,</v>

146
00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:57.960
<v Speaker 1>but they definitely stick you with needles right away.</v>

147
00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:59.790

<v Speaker 1>and spins it around.</v>

177
00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:54.930
<v Speaker 1>He's the only guy knows how to do it cause he's done it with calves.</v>

178
00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:56.280
<v Speaker 1>We've got a breach crab.</v>

190
00:05:29.521 --> 00:05:33.150
<v Speaker 1>strangled the [inaudible] mountain nurse baby.</v>

191
00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:35.250
<v Speaker 1>And then he'd do a smack it to make it cry.</v>

192
00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:36.413
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

193
00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:37.051
<v Speaker 1>And the poor thing,</v>

194
00:05:37.051 --> 00:05:37.620
<v Speaker 1>it's just like,</v>

195
00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:38.700
<v Speaker 1>what happened?</v>

196
00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:39.850
<v Speaker 1>What happened?</v>

197
00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:40.590
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

198
00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:44.020
<v Speaker 1>And that's what pushed us to go out and look at this like,</v>

199
00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:44.790
<v Speaker 1>so we,</v>

200
00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:48.990
<v Speaker 1>we went to the West Bank and hung out with this comedy satire troop.</v>

201
00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:49.650
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

202

<v Speaker 1>Who has a television show that it's,</v>

203
00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:54.180
<v Speaker 1>it's once a week,</v>

204
00:05:54.181 --> 00:05:57.090
<v Speaker 1>but during Ramadan it's every single night for 30.</v>

205
00:05:58.940 --> 00:05:59.810
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

206
00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:00.893
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>

207

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:01.971
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

209
00:06:01.971 --> 00:06:03.440
<v Speaker 1>And so like we hung out with these folks,</v>

210
00:06:03.441 --> 00:06:03.620
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

211
00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:07.370
<v Speaker 1>so these are people who are there living in the West Bank and they're</v>

212
00:06:07.371 --> 00:06:08.840
<v Speaker 1>criticizing everyone.</v>

213
00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:10.940
<v Speaker 1>So they're criticizing the Palestinians,</v>

214
00:06:10.941 --> 00:06:11.510
<v Speaker 1>Israel,</v>

215
00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:12.280
<v Speaker 1>the Israelis,</v>

216
00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:13.580
<v Speaker 1>the Americans,</v>

00:06:17.481 --> 00:06:18.630
<v Speaker 1>like Oh,</v>

00:06:20.991 --> 00:06:21.201
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

225
00:06:21.201 --> 00:06:21.461
<v Speaker 1>Like the,</v>

226
00:06:21.461 --> 00:06:21.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

227
00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:26.480
<v Speaker 1>these guys are doing really cutting edge stuff in this place that there,</v>

228
00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:28.910
<v Speaker 1>there aren't comedy clubs like your,</v>

229
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.640
<v Speaker 1>the way that you get professional comedy,</v>

230
00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:37.240
<v Speaker 1>there's like two shows on Palestinian national television or you need to find it</v>

231
00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:42.110
<v Speaker 1>broadcast from Egypt or from Jordan or I'm not sure Jordan,</v>

232
00:06:42.111 --> 00:06:43.940
<v Speaker 1>because evidently the Jordans aren't terribly funny.</v>

233
00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:45.080
<v Speaker 1>Jordanis aren't very funny.</v>

234
00:06:45.081 --> 00:06:47.060
<v Speaker 1>But the Egyptians are like rural areas,</v>

235
00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:48.590
<v Speaker 1>Jordanians or funny,</v>

236
00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:50.030
<v Speaker 1>that Guy Right now listening.</v>

237
00:06:50.031 --> 00:06:50.870
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking pissed.</v>

238
00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:51.850
<v Speaker 1>There is a no,</v>

239
00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:53.510
<v Speaker 1>we talked to these guys and they're like,</v>

240
00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:53.781
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>

241
00:06:53.781 --> 00:06:54.490
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

242
00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:55.130
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

243
00:06:55.130 --> 00:07:00.130
<v Speaker 1>there's like a hierarchy of comedy in the Middle East and according to them the</v>

244
00:07:00.681 --> 00:07:02.330
<v Speaker 1>Palestinians are about the middle.</v>

245
00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:06.410
<v Speaker 1>The Egyptians are hilarious really.</v>

246
00:07:06.411 --> 00:07:11.411
<v Speaker 1>And the Jordanians evidently are like the most serious or Hawaii.</v>

247
00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:12.800
<v Speaker 1>They're very funny.</v>

248
00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:13.250
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

249
00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:14.270
<v Speaker 1>What do you attribute that to?</v>

250
00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:17.060
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember.</v>

251
00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:17.983
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

252
00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:18.411
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

253
00:07:18.411 --> 00:07:18.681
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

254
00:07:18.681 --> 00:07:19.281
<v Speaker 1>Joel was here.</v>

255
00:07:19.281 --> 00:07:20.330
<v Speaker 1>He remembers everything.</v>

256
00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:21.920
<v Speaker 1>He cause he writes it all down.</v>

257
00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:23.510
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

258
00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:23.661
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

259
00:07:23.661 --> 00:07:24.890
<v Speaker 1>there's like a long history of,</v>

260
00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:25.301
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

261
00:07:25.301 --> 00:07:25.880
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

262
00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:28.340
<v Speaker 1>of Egyptian comedy.</v>

263
00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:29.330
<v Speaker 1>Ha.</v>

264
00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:30.320
<v Speaker 1>Very funny people.</v>

265
00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:31.220
<v Speaker 1>What about,</v>

266
00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:31.730
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

267
00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:33.950
<v Speaker 1>the Israelis do they factor in there?</v>

268
00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:34.281
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

269
00:07:34.281 --> 00:07:34.640
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

270
00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:37.580
<v Speaker 1>so what was really fascinating was that,</v>

271
00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:38.481
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

272
00:07:38.481 --> 00:07:38.900
<v Speaker 1>so we,</v>

273
00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:39.081
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

274
00:07:39.081 --> 00:07:41.120
<v Speaker 1>you have kind of the stereotype of the,</v>

275
00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:42.013
<v Speaker 1>of the,</v>

276
00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:43.820
<v Speaker 1>the funny Jewish person,</v>

277
00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:44.181
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

278
00:07:44.181 --> 00:07:45.750
<v Speaker 1>Very self deprecating.</v>

279
00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:46.790
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

280
00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:50.780
<v Speaker 1>but you don't find that style of comedy in Israel as much.</v>

281
00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:52.363
<v Speaker 1>The Israeli,</v>

282
00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:53.410
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

283
00:07:53.410 --> 00:07:55.130
<v Speaker 1>comedy is a lot more aggressive.</v>

284
00:07:55.131 --> 00:07:55.964
<v Speaker 1>Like it's the,</v>

285
00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:58.880
<v Speaker 1>it's the comedy of the victor not of the,</v>

286
00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:00.350
<v Speaker 1>of the victim.</v>

287
00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:01.221
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>

288
00:08:01.221 --> 00:08:01.480
<v Speaker 1>How's,</v>

289
00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:06.020
<v Speaker 1>and so we found this weird reversal where the Palestinians were much more sort</v>

290
00:08:06.021 --> 00:08:11.021
<v Speaker 1>of self deprecating and their comedy was much more Jewish in,</v>

291
00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:15.860
<v Speaker 1>in the American sense than you would have necessarily expected.</v>

292
00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:17.320
<v Speaker 1>So it was really,</v>

293
00:08:17.321 --> 00:08:18.350
<v Speaker 1>I was really fascinating.</v>

294
00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:28.430
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
