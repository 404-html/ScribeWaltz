Naturebox my new favorite snacks.

4
00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.290
Naturebox has this thing called [inaudible] Serratia.
That's how I say it,
right.

5
00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.630
So Rochester,
Rochester,
cashews,

6
00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.490
they're the best fucking snack I've ever eaten in my life.
I said it the best.

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.350
It's an incredible,

10
00:00:32.701 --> 00:00:35.370
whatever,
and like,
not tempt yourself with bullshit,

11
00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:40.410
not have like potato chips and nonsense laying around and they can accommodate

12
00:00:40.711 --> 00:00:45.360
specific needs.
Like if you want low sugar,
gluten free,
things along those lines.

13
00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.660
They have all sorts of different choices.
More than a hundred different choices,

14
00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.790
really fucking delicious stuff.
The big apple pineapples.
Oh my God.

15
00:00:53.791 --> 00:00:58.170
Big Island rather.
Not Big Apple.
Big Island.
Pineapples are delicious.
Um,
uh,

16
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.340
planting chips,
the south Pacific plant,
teen chips,
really yummy stuff.

17
00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.280
More than a hundred different things.
Hundred percent,
no trans fats,

18
00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:11.070
hundred percent zero high fructose corn syrup,
nothing artificial.

19
00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.020
It's about as healthy as you can get.
When it comes to yummy snacks.
I mean,

20
00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:20.410
they have stuff like pretzels,
which realistically are never healthy.
You know,

21
00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.580
it's like fucking doe,
you're eating doe,
but for the most part,

22
00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.740
if you want to eat healthy,
they can hook you up.

23
00:01:25.741 --> 00:01:29.340
And if you want to mix healthy up with not so healthy,
you could do that too.

24
00:01:29.341 --> 00:01:32.580
But all of it is delicious and they have free shipping anywhere in the u s

25

n n,
I.
T.
Um,

33
00:02:03.121 --> 00:02:05.100
if you've never tried any of on its supplements,

34
00:02:05.101 --> 00:02:07.530
if you never tried any of on its products and you're like,

35
00:02:07.531 --> 00:02:09.330
what the fuck is this honest?
Should I keep hearing about,

36
00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.520
there's a bunch of things that they've discovered.
Scientist,
intelligent people,

37
00:02:14.521 --> 00:02:15.870
researchers,
nutritionist,

38
00:02:15.871 --> 00:02:20.580
things all over the world that can improve various aspects of human performance,

39
00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.870
whether it's the way your mind works,
what they call cognitive function,

40
00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.960
or whether it's the way your body utilizes oxygen,

41
00:02:27.961 --> 00:02:31.500
the way your brain promotes Saratonin use.

42
00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:37.230
You can actually benefit your body by taking supplements that are the building

43
00:02:37.231 --> 00:02:41.940
blocks for various neurotransmitters.
And that's what Alpha brain is all about.

44
00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.940
Alpha brain is what's called a nootropic and this is a very controversial point

45
00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.881
of,

46
00:02:47.881 --> 00:02:50.700
of discussion because there's a lot of people that think that anything that you

47
00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.620
just like vet claim,
hey,

48
00:02:52.621 --> 00:02:54.930
there's going to be something that makes your brain work better,
bitch,

49
00:02:54.931 --> 00:02:57.240
get the fuck outta here.
That sounds retarded.

50
00:02:57.241 --> 00:03:00.220
It doesn't sound like it makes any sense at all.
I agree with you.

51
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.110
It sounds like horse shit.
But if you step back and you look at,
well,
what,

52
00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.950
what is the difference between me on a good day and me and a sucky day?

53
00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.160
There's a difference.
I don't know what it is,
but there's me.

54
00:03:12.161 --> 00:03:16.210
When I'm rested and I'm feeling good,
I'm happy.

55
00:03:16.211 --> 00:03:20.020
Everything's in tune where my brain fires good,

56
00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.800
like I can have conversations and I flow well.
I'm eating well,

57
00:03:23.801 --> 00:03:26.440
I'm drinking a lot of water.
It works better.

58
00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.120
You got to think that everything you take in your body has a direct effect on

59
00:03:31.121 --> 00:03:35.680
how your body reacts.
Number one,
can't stress this enough.
Eat good food.

60
00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:36.730
That's the most important thing.

61
00:03:36.731 --> 00:03:40.030
It's more important than any supplement you can take.
Eat healthy food,

62
00:03:40.031 --> 00:03:42.100
rich in nutrition,
a lot of green vegetables,

63
00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:45.730
all that stuff is a no brainer and it's,
it's number one,

64
00:03:45.731 --> 00:03:47.140
it's the base of the pyramid,

65
00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:52.530
but after that comes the question of optimization and can you get completely

66
00:03:53.051 --> 00:03:56.680
fully optimized through just your food?
I don't think you can.

67
00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:58.090
I don't think you can.

68
00:03:58.091 --> 00:04:01.870
I think there are benefits to certain supplements and those supplements are the

69
00:04:01.871 --> 00:04:05.620
ones that we sell it on it.
We find things that we find to be beneficial.

70
00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:07.180
We look at the research behind it,

71
00:04:07.181 --> 00:04:10.870
we post all the research behind it with references.
And if we've,

72
00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:13.390
if we tried and we use it and we'd like it,
we start selling it.

73
00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.960
All the research is available.
But on it for all of the different,

74
00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.600
whether it's all the different supplements,

75
00:04:19.601 --> 00:04:23.560
whether it's Alpha brain or shroom tech sport,
there's the stories behind it,

76
00:04:23.561 --> 00:04:25.510
the logic behind it,
the research behind it.

77
00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:29.350
And we've also done our own double blind placebo studies with Alpha brain and

78
00:04:29.351 --> 00:04:32.670
showed clinically beneficial results.
And we're on it running a,

79
00:04:32.671 --> 00:04:36.250
a much larger study right now.
The first study we did,
it's published,

80
00:04:36.251 --> 00:04:38.390
it's all available at [inaudible] dot com um,

81
00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.590
we did it with a small group of people.
It's what's called a pilot study.

82
00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:45.400
They did that,
it was effective,
but for people I think dropped out.

83
00:04:45.401 --> 00:04:48.760
So He's 16 out of 20,
which is really good,
but not enough.

84
00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:51.340
So we're doing a big one now with ADP people,

85
00:04:51.341 --> 00:04:54.880
but the research behind all the individual ingredients in Alpha brain,

86
00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.120
all of them,
and you know,
the references to the,

87
00:04:58.121 --> 00:04:59.740
to that research is all available.

88
00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:02.530
All the explanations to the layman a much better than,

89
00:05:02.531 --> 00:05:05.050
I can give it to you myself in a in a commercial,

90
00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:10.440
but the two sort of counter that controversial aspect of these things,

91
00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:14.200
we have a 100% 30 pills,

92
00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:17.830
90 day money back guarantee,
so if you try,
whether it's shroom tech,

93
00:05:17.831 --> 00:05:21.790
which really is like one of the best endurance supplements I've ever tried in my

94
00:05:21.791 --> 00:05:24.370
life and it's all based on the quarter steps mushroom.

95
00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:29.080
If you go and try new mood,
which is a five HTP supplement,

96
00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:32.530
which actually enhances your mood and it enhances your brain's ability to

97
00:05:32.531 --> 00:05:35.770
produce Serotonin,
it's the building blocks of Serotonin,

98
00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:40.120
five HTP en El trip to fan,
which actually converts to five HTP.

99
00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:42.910
All of it explained it.
audit.com and like I said,

100
00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:44.200
a hundred percent money back guarantee.

101
00:05:44.201 --> 00:05:47.530
You don't even have to return the product to say this stuff is what bitch,

102
00:05:47.531 --> 00:05:51.910
you lie to me and you'd get your money back.
Ludicrous man.
That's awesome.
Yeah.

103
00:05:51.911 --> 00:05:56.710
Ludicrous.
Was playing with some on Onnit kettlebells.

104
00:05:56.711 --> 00:05:58.130

108
00:06:07.441 --> 00:06:10.310

109
00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:12.030
no goddamn trainer with you everywhere.

110

<v 0>I've been able to see some shit in my life.</v>

128
00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:23.100
I've been able to see a lot of shit up close and personal.

129
00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:26.190
I've seen way more than a thousand fights.

130
00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:28.080
I don't know how many I've ever seen professionally.

131
00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:31.320
The best fight I ever saw in my life.

132
00:07:31.321 --> 00:07:35.520
They'll finest performance was this man sitting across the table from me.

133
00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:41.010
Tj Dillashaw,
your fight with Hannah Barao was the slickest,
most technical,

134
00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:45.180
most beautiful mountain that I've ever seen anybody climb the way you did.

135
00:07:45.181 --> 00:07:47.370
That shit was seriously like,

136
00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:51.030
it's no matter what happens from now on to the end of time.

137
00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:52.740
That was a milestone to me.

138
00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:57.840
That was like a guy who rose to the occasion against the biggest drag in and the

139
00:07:57.841 --> 00:08:01.740
fucking forest.
The one everybody was scared of.
Dude.

140
00:08:01.741 --> 00:08:03.870
Hanan Barao was a fucking werewolf.

141
00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:09.080
That dude was wheel kicking people in the face and fucking do it like leaping

142
00:08:09.241 --> 00:08:12.870
knees and pound dudes out,
taking their backs like a ghost.

143
00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:17.910
Just wicked looked wicked at every turn.
Undefeated for like 30 fucking fights.

144
00:08:17.911 --> 00:08:22.560
I mean it was incredible and a brown was a beast and Tj Dillashaw you picked him

145
00:08:22.561 --> 00:08:24.870
apart.
You moved around him,

146
00:08:24.871 --> 00:08:28.380
you looked like you look so relaxed in there for the moment.

147
00:08:28.381 --> 00:08:31.020
You got into that cage.
I go,
look at this kid,

148
00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:32.850
he looks like he's in a sparring session.

149
00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:37.230
You were just loose and move and you weren't doing anything that showed that you

150
00:08:37.231 --> 00:08:40.620
were tense,
you and you weren't doing anything like what?
You're hesitating,

151
00:08:40.621 --> 00:08:42.900
anything where you're like dipping your feet into the water.

152
00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:47.670
It was like from the get go you were in the groove and you could see right away

153
00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:51.930
there was a thing where brown was like,
oh shit.
What the fuck's going on here?

154
00:08:52.170 --> 00:08:56.220
Somewhere in the first couple of minutes before you landed that right hand in

155
00:08:56.221 --> 00:08:59.370
the first round.
Somewhere in those first couple of minutes you could see,

156
00:08:59.371 --> 00:09:01.470
he was like,
I am getting fucked up here.

157
00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:05.640
Like this dude is hitting me and I can't hit this dude and all of a sudden wack

158
00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:10.910
you drop this right hand on him over the top of the left shoulder on the button,

159
00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:15.450
the legs give out.
He goes down and I'm like Holy Shit.

160
00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:19.710
And He survived the rest of the fight into the fifth round when he stopped and,

161
00:09:19.711 --> 00:09:22.560
but he was done after,
he just wasn't the same after that.

162
00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:25.920
And his corner was telling them do not exchange with this guy.

163
00:09:25.921 --> 00:09:29.880
Stay away from the exchanges.
I was like,
I can't believe what I'm hearing.

164
00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:33.840
This is the cra,
his corners telling him to run from Tj Dillashaw.
They're like,

165
00:09:33.841 --> 00:09:38.190
take this fucking guy down,
grab him and take him down.

166
00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:41.460
Which you know,
you would just wouldn't think would be their strategy.

167
00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:44.850
So it was like a clear adjustment of something that was going on in a fight.

168
00:09:45.130 --> 00:09:47.100
<v 3>Well thank you.
I appreciate that.
Often.</v>

169
00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:50.650
Have a grin on my face the rest of the day now man.

170
00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:53.520
<v 0>Oh,
you deserve it.
You deserve it.
And more,
you know,</v>

171
00:09:53.521 --> 00:09:56.340
you two together or a very unique combination.

172
00:09:56.520 --> 00:10:00.210
It's really interesting because I've had the pleasure of being friends with guys

173
00:10:00.211 --> 00:10:04.050
like Duke Roufus who's a great trainer and a great guy and Greg Jackson's great

174
00:10:04.051 --> 00:10:06.360
trainer,
great guy,
Mark Tele,
Tammy.
I've,

175
00:10:06.361 --> 00:10:10.500
I've had a chance to become friends with so many of these guys and one of the

176
00:10:10.501 --> 00:10:15.501
more problematic aspects of fighter trainer relationships are like that fighters

177
00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:19.410
are kind of like stubborn and they're,

178
00:10:19.411 --> 00:10:22.710
they have a lot of ego in the effort and so are trainers and a lot of trainers

179
00:10:22.711 --> 00:10:26.250
used to be fighters and a lot of guys have this my way or the highway thing

180
00:10:26.251 --> 00:10:29.040
going on and a lot of other guys don't like to take instruction.

181
00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:31.500
It's a lot of weirdness when it comes to fighters.

182
00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:34.440
It's a lot of weirdness when it comes to emotions after losses.

183
00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:38.370
Trying to figure out who's to blame,
passing blame when maybe you shouldn't.

184
00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:40.650
But every now and then it works perfect.

185
00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:44.910
Every now and then you got like this puzzle where these two dudes are actually

186
00:10:44.911 --> 00:10:49.800
friends and you see at work out great.
And that's why I see you guys right now.

187
00:10:50.130 --> 00:10:54.780
You guys are in this rare space,
you know,
like Rufus has it with Anthony Pettis,

188
00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:55.651
you know,
like,

189
00:10:55.651 --> 00:10:58.500
and he's had it with a lot of other fighters that he's trained as well because

190
00:10:58.501 --> 00:11:01.290
he's such a friendly and affable guy,
you know.

191
00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:06.540
And Dwayne you found a way to you and Tj,
the way you guys sync together.

192
00:11:06.541 --> 00:11:09.890
I see it,
you know,
I see when you talk about fines,
I s I had the,

193
00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:14.760
the privilege of a watching you work with them once at my gym holding pads for

194
00:11:14.761 --> 00:11:17.340
him and I was watching you coach him and you guys,

195
00:11:17.341 --> 00:11:20.520
the way you guys move together.
It's real interesting relationship.

196
00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.130
<v 3>Yeah.
It helps out that,
uh,</v>

197
00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:24.900
he cares how I do and that not only I want to win for myself,

198
00:11:24.901 --> 00:11:25.920
but I want to win for him too.

199
00:11:25.921 --> 00:11:28.980
It holds like this higher standard of like what I want to do every day I get in

200
00:11:28.981 --> 00:11:33.060
the gym,
I've got a guy watching me 24,
seven on what I'm doing wrong or right.

201
00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:36.450
And so I want to like not only pleasing your father and you're a kid,

202
00:11:36.451 --> 00:11:38.310
you know what I mean?
Like doing the things right for him.
You know?

203
00:11:38.311 --> 00:11:40.380
It's like the same thing I want to do,
do it.

204
00:11:40.381 --> 00:11:43.290
Dwayne is show me the right way and it's like I'm just got addicted to doing it.

205
00:11:43.610 --> 00:11:47.810
<v 0>So cool.
It's so cool to see.
I love watching shit work,
you know?</v>

206
00:11:47.811 --> 00:11:51.950
So it's so cool to see you go over to this Alpha male team and then all of a

207
00:11:51.951 --> 00:11:55.690
sudden,
boom.
I mean you got this camp full of killers,

208
00:11:55.870 --> 00:11:58.120
like arguably the best light,

209
00:11:58.150 --> 00:12:03.070
lighter weight camp overall in the country without a doubt.
Top three,
right,

210
00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:06.220
of,
if not the country,
the world.
There's no Uniao does you guys,

211
00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:09.340
and it's you know,
a couple of other places that,

212
00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:13.330
that have that kind of pool of talent and the lighter weight divisions you guys

213
00:12:13.331 --> 00:12:15.800
have it locked down.
Yeah,
there's definitely a,

214
00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:18.100
this is a special time and martial arts history.

215
00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:19.790
Let's go on and right now with the,

216
00:12:19.830 --> 00:12:21.910
the team that was just have with me on the team,
it's,

217
00:12:22.110 --> 00:12:24.150
it's something special for sure.
You know what,

218
00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:27.490
it seems like this is a special time in martial arts history period.

219
00:12:27.730 --> 00:12:30.820
It really seems like there's a lot of energy on MMA right now.

220
00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:34.780
The fact that there was two UFC is going on at the same time on Saturday,

221
00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:37.000
you know,
that was pretty wild.
And I just,

222
00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:42.180
I feel like more people are aware that the highs in MMA or higher than any other

223
00:12:43.541 --> 00:12:46.900
sport is,
you can't compare a ball going into a net.

224
00:12:46.930 --> 00:12:50.620
It's still just a fucking ball going into a net.
And when you hit,

225
00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:55.090
you had kicked tennent brown that fifth round and you saw his knees go and you

226
00:12:55.091 --> 00:12:56.530
moved in for the close or I was like,

227
00:12:56.590 --> 00:13:01.150
Oh shit dominates him for four rounds and he's going to head kick them and stop

228
00:13:01.151 --> 00:13:04.930
them.
This is crazy.
That kind of feeling of being a fan of watching.

229
00:13:04.931 --> 00:13:08.320
Oh a wild fight like that.
It's super hard to describe

230
00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:09.600
<v 3>and put putting your,
you're putting,</v>

231
00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:11.390
it's Kinda like putting your life on the line when you're in there.

232
00:13:11.391 --> 00:13:13.880
You know what I mean?
Even though it's not,
but it feels like that I kinda,

233
00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:17.330
I kinda adrenaline rush and,
and that feeling of,
once you get the fight done,

234
00:13:17.331 --> 00:13:20.170
there's no better feeling in the world.
Just kind of,
you have to,

235
00:13:20.210 --> 00:13:21.530
you have to scream and go crazy.

236
00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:24.560
<v 0>I couldn't imagine.
I couldn't imagine I knew what it was like the,</v>

237
00:13:24.561 --> 00:13:26.050
when a taekwondo tournament,
which is

238
00:13:27.710 --> 00:13:30.350
nothing compared to a UFC fight,

239
00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:32.870
especially UFC fight for the world title,

240
00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:34.640
especially the UFC fight for the world title.

241
00:13:34.641 --> 00:13:38.210
When you're an eight to one underdog on the consensus pound for pound,

242
00:13:38.211 --> 00:13:41.870
at least number two guy in the world,
it's like John Jones in him.

243
00:13:41.871 --> 00:13:45.920
They would alternate between one and two and in my opinion,
mighty mouse.
I don't,

244
00:13:45.990 --> 00:13:48.200
in my opinion,
they don't give money mouse enough credit.

245
00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:50.710
He's never in the top four of people's lists.
I think he's,

246
00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:52.940
he could be number one.
I mean he's right up there.

247
00:13:52.970 --> 00:13:56.660
He's as good as anybody in the world.
Awesome athlete for sure.
Perfect.

248
00:13:56.661 --> 00:13:59.290
Technically everything he does is perfect.
The way it,

249
00:13:59.291 --> 00:14:01.280
I mean I always say like young fighters,

250
00:14:01.281 --> 00:14:04.370
like you want to learn how to fight perfectly.
Watch a guy like that.

251
00:14:04.371 --> 00:14:06.860
Watch a guy who was a longtime veteran one time,

252
00:14:06.890 --> 00:14:10.790
been a champion for quite a few fights.
Now he's,
he's as legit as it gets,

253
00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:14.720
but you stepped in there with a guy who's right up there with him.
I mean,

254
00:14:14.721 --> 00:14:17.210
that's where everybody thought.
That's where I thought,
I mean,
I still do.

255
00:14:17.510 --> 00:14:21.770
I still think he's an elite,
elite fighter and you figured it out together.

256
00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:26.780
You figured out a style and a strategy to expose what you felt like were some

257
00:14:26.781 --> 00:14:31.160
areas where he was vulnerable and we actually talked at lunch about the very

258
00:14:31.161 --> 00:14:32.540
techniques that TJ was using,

259
00:14:32.780 --> 00:14:36.770
especially how you kept passing under his left and you were behind him.

260
00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:38.680
Dude,
I was,

261
00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:42.170
<v 3>I knew that I was a lot faster than him.
You know,
he's,
he's a big one,</v>

262
00:14:42.171 --> 00:14:45.640
35 pounder and he's very powerful,
but I think that hinders the speed.
You know,

263
00:14:45.641 --> 00:14:47.720
I think he,
I think he's too big for the weight class almost,

264
00:14:47.721 --> 00:14:50.780
and I knew that I could be so much faster than him and create the angles that he

265
00:14:50.781 --> 00:14:53.840
wouldn't be ale to keep up you.
He looked lost even in just the first round.

266
00:14:53.841 --> 00:14:56.060
Like he couldn't find me do you couldn't,
he couldn't.

267
00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:59.300
He wanted to like hold me and stop me to be able to kick me or hate me.

268
00:14:59.301 --> 00:15:01.670
This is big right hand,
you know,
he throws the same techniques.

269
00:15:01.671 --> 00:15:03.380
They're just a little bit too slow.
I think

270
00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:04.730
<v 0>it's so fascinating.</v>

271
00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:08.840
It's so fascinating watching your evolution from the ultimate fighter.
I mean,

272
00:15:08.841 --> 00:15:12.590
I've had the pleasure of watching you from the moment you were introduced to the

273
00:15:12.591 --> 00:15:16.730
world when you started doing the ultimate fighter and you were hungry.
Young Kid,

274
00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:21.440
lots of potential,
but loss of potential and then world champion,

275
00:15:21.441 --> 00:15:25.100
one of the finest performances the sports ever seen and just a couple of years.

276
00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:28.220
That's amazing.
Yeah,
definitely.
That's why I just had a,

277
00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:31.260
my buddy James Blair making me a highlight of just his law is the recent Fred

278
00:15:31.261 --> 00:15:35.910
since I've been here.
And just to see the progression of each fight.
Just Jamie,

279
00:15:37.010 --> 00:15:40.350
load that shit up.
Let's watch that.
Cause it is pretty incredible.

280
00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:43.170
It tells a story.
I'm not trying to give you a big head kid.
No,
I know.

281
00:15:46.130 --> 00:15:47.030
I'm already thinking about it.

282
00:15:47.070 --> 00:15:49.410
<v 3>Defending the title and half an hour get nervous about that.</v>

283
00:15:49.411 --> 00:15:52.800
You know what I mean?
So you gotta you gotta keep yourself hungry to get better.

284
00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:55.830
And I think that's why I've gained so God's so good so fast.

285
00:15:56.210 --> 00:16:01.160
<v 0>I agree.
I full full trust in a full,
uh,
knowledge that you'll,</v>

286
00:16:01.370 --> 00:16:04.060
you'll navigate the waters.
So you got to this far too competitive.

287
00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:06.500
You get that big of a head man,
I'm sure you're smart enough to know.

288
00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:11.100
That's the beautiful thing about where we live today is that people you get see

289
00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:14.390
back when like the Muhammad Ali days or anybody before that,
hold on a second.

290
00:16:15.230 --> 00:16:17.810
It was,
it was hard to get like information.

291
00:16:17.811 --> 00:16:20.150
It was hard to watch documentaries and fighters lives.

292
00:16:20.390 --> 00:16:22.310
It was hard to read books on their lives.

293
00:16:22.311 --> 00:16:25.820
You kind of just got stories from old trainers and there was a lot of mistakes

294
00:16:25.821 --> 00:16:29.040
that were repeated over and over and over again.
But at a certain point in time,

295
00:16:29.041 --> 00:16:31.220
in today's Day and age,
especially with the Internet,

296
00:16:31.221 --> 00:16:34.520
you get checked enough so they're getting completely cocky and delusional like

297
00:16:34.521 --> 00:16:36.550
some fighters had gotten.
It's,
it's,

298
00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:40.910
you got to try hard to get that way today because dudes a chippy down,
you know,

299
00:16:40.970 --> 00:16:44.420
and the world expose you.
And there's like really good writers now too.

300
00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:49.100
Who would like,
there's a,
um,
was it Jack Slack?
Is that the dude's name?
Who was,

301
00:16:49.101 --> 00:16:52.400
uh,
did that take down the video?
Uh,

302
00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:56.990
he uses a lot of animated gifts and then,
uh,
talked about your article,

303
00:16:57.450 --> 00:17:00.320
it talks about your fight in an article.
I haven't seen it.
You haven't seen it?

304
00:17:00.350 --> 00:17:02.600
It's fantastic.
Let me,
let me find it.

305
00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:06.530
If we get a chance here while we're watching this,
uh,
this,
uh,
highlight and I'll,

306
00:17:06.531 --> 00:17:08.790
um,
I'll give the guy the full shout out and what,

307
00:17:08.791 --> 00:17:13.100
where the website is even watch it because he could rope down the very strategy

308
00:17:13.101 --> 00:17:17.770
that you used and show after,
sorry.
I'm sorry.
With the,

309
00:17:17.771 --> 00:17:19.820
with animated highlights of you doing it.

310
00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:24.290
So explained what he had done wrong and past fights and how you capitalized on

311
00:17:24.291 --> 00:17:25.940
it.
Okay,
brilliant article.

312
00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:28.970
There's an article that came out after my fight after the fight,

313
00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:34.510
but it's so indicative of this new wave of like superintelligent fans that

314
00:17:34.761 --> 00:17:38.330
breakdown fights and super intelligent,
you know,
martial arts analysts,

315
00:17:38.331 --> 00:17:39.141
you can call them fans,

316
00:17:39.141 --> 00:17:42.470
but a lot of these guys have been martial artists their whole life.

317
00:17:42.471 --> 00:17:45.590
They just have another job.
Correct.
So there's still fans of martial arts.

318
00:17:45.591 --> 00:17:48.890
So they choose to write these really brilliant articles on something and you're

319
00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:53.610
seeing just way more info,
more info about what works,

320
00:17:53.611 --> 00:17:57.780
what doesn't work,
and more info about like the,
the,
the mistakes of the past.

321
00:17:57.781 --> 00:18:01.460
Like things that were guys are fucked up.
Let's,
let's take a look at that.
Uh,

322
00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:03.540
that documentary or this a highlight.

323
00:18:07.150 --> 00:18:09.680
<v 4>She's my desk.
Just got to believe this</v>

324
00:18:11.410 --> 00:18:12.380
my time.

325
00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:20.290
I just kind

326
00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:27.500
perfectly into his fighting style.

327
00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:13.580
Modern Day Ninja.

328
00:19:14.290 --> 00:19:18.380
<v 5>This highlight reel.
So awesome rocks.
What is the name of the highlight reel?</v>

329
00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:23.380
Watch it.
Cause they're listening to this.
When is it a power of belief?
Yes.

330
00:19:23.650 --> 00:19:26.080
Tj Dillashaw the power of belief,
man.

331
00:19:26.081 --> 00:19:30.190
What a great title for this sort of a highlight reel.

332
00:19:30.910 --> 00:19:33.730
I mean that really is what,
it's perfect.
It's perfect title.

333
00:19:33.790 --> 00:19:35.490
How much do you really believe in one?

334
00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:39.610
<v 0>Okay,</v>

335
00:19:39.610 --> 00:19:43.090
<v 4>no doubt.
There's no denying.
Having Bill Rob with the number one</v>

336
00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:47.530
who's the number one pound for pound fighters,
get a

337
00:19:53.710 --> 00:19:57.550
decade of losing the fight to Jake Dillashaw with 15 months.

338
00:19:59.030 --> 00:20:01.060
It's a completely different team.

339
00:20:05.380 --> 00:20:09.200
<v 5>He was straight Nick Diaz.
Nick Diaz Fan.</v>

340
00:20:09.890 --> 00:20:13.610
That's awesome.
That's awesome.
You had nick Diaz and missteps.

341
00:20:13.670 --> 00:20:16.370
I think I've done in my last three fights.
I've just been a huge fan of DSL.

342
00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:20.870
It's so cool.
I love it,
man.
I love it.
Oh,

343
00:20:20.871 --> 00:20:23.180
that right hand was so wicked,
man.

344
00:20:25.490 --> 00:20:30.360
I knew right there,
man.
Louis Louis on the business base.

345
00:20:32.270 --> 00:20:34.760
You know what?
It wasn't like he wasn't swinging.
Dude,
that's still,

346
00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:38.000
that dude was still throwing heavy leather.
He goes in the fight.

347
00:20:38.950 --> 00:20:40.880
He's got a good jab.
You pop my head back a couple of times.

348
00:20:40.881 --> 00:20:45.650
We'll do an awesome job here.
It's hard,
man.
He,
it's very hard.
He's very fast too.

349
00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:52.150
So for you to say you were way faster than him is redonkulous son.

350
00:20:54.750 --> 00:20:58.510
Well I bet you were.
I mean it wasn't just that it was everything.

351
00:20:58.870 --> 00:21:00.190
It was a combination of everything.

352
00:21:00.191 --> 00:21:02.830
It was who he was not one thing that you could tie it down to.

353
00:21:02.890 --> 00:21:06.460
It was your movement.
It was your confidence,
your relaxation in there.

354
00:21:06.610 --> 00:21:07.480
How you look at that.

355
00:21:07.481 --> 00:21:10.780
Just just that series that you just did where you ducked under that right hand

356
00:21:10.781 --> 00:21:12.100
of his and cracked him again.

357
00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:16.510
You were just hitting them with a volume of strikes.
That was preposterous.

358
00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:17.950
He just couldn't deal with it.

359
00:21:18.430 --> 00:21:20.830
It's because of this guy's got me striking it at all angles.
You know,

360
00:21:20.831 --> 00:21:23.470
cell phone were incredible.
No matter where he goes,
I can be able to,

361
00:21:23.710 --> 00:21:24.543
I'm able to strike.

362
00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:29.290
Excellent days,
man.

363
00:21:29.770 --> 00:21:34.630
That fucking picture so awesome to that fixture of you freaking out after you

364
00:21:34.631 --> 00:21:37.880
won,
you just look like electricity was shooting out of your body.

365
00:21:38.310 --> 00:21:42.490
Psychopath does she look so ridiculous?

366
00:21:43.450 --> 00:21:46.720
It's one of the greatest pictures in all of MMA.
That picture of you just

367
00:21:46.970 --> 00:21:51.920
<v 3>raw.
There's amazing feeling.
I appreciate that.</v>

368
00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:00.210
<v 5>No shit</v>

369
00:22:00.210 --> 00:22:02.840
<v 3>man.
Wow.
How old are you now,
man?</v>

370
00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:07.640
28 what does that feel like?
When does this ride like?
It's been crazy.

371
00:22:07.730 --> 00:22:09.780
It's been,
especially for our fastest spin.
I mean,

372
00:22:09.781 --> 00:22:11.630
obviously I pictured myself being the best in the world,

373
00:22:11.631 --> 00:22:15.270
but I never expected it to be this fast and for me to catch on as fast as I did

374
00:22:15.271 --> 00:22:17.330
and when I quit school and thought thought about fighting,

375
00:22:17.331 --> 00:22:19.640
it was just kind of like,
I hope I can make this work.

376
00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:20.913
<v 5>No,</v>

377
00:22:21.930 --> 00:22:25.700
<v 0>this is going to pan out.
Seems like it panned out pretty good.
Yeah,</v>

378
00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:30.600
you're,
the crazy thing is you're getting better.
I mean you,
if you can,

379
00:22:30.601 --> 00:22:33.940
can continue at the same pace.
Again,
I hate blowing smoke up people's ass,

380
00:22:33.941 --> 00:22:37.600
but I think you can handle it if you can continue at this pace that you're at

381
00:22:37.601 --> 00:22:41.200
right now,
just the amount of development that I've seen from you in,

382
00:22:41.201 --> 00:22:43.930
from the time you're on the ultimate fighter to the time you become champion.

383
00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:46.740
I've never seen it.
I've never seen anybody improved that quickly.

384
00:22:46.810 --> 00:22:51.350
I appreciate that.
It's amazing you two together or wild combination.
Yeah,

385
00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:53.830
it's a why.
It's a weird combination,
man.

386
00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:58.430
<v 3>It's because he's so hyper and craziness and then I stay calm and whether they'd</v>

387
00:22:58.460 --> 00:22:59.510
kind of just meshes,
you know what I mean?

388
00:22:59.511 --> 00:23:02.750
Like he's like a hundred miles an hour and I'll like calm down a little bit and

389
00:23:02.751 --> 00:23:04.880
just like makes us perfect or of like

390
00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:07.180
<v 0>I'm trying to,
I'm trying to be calm right now.</v>

391
00:23:07.181 --> 00:23:10.850
Not me to can I provide for you the relaxed spaceships hover.

392
00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:15.190
You're a part of the whole developmental process though with that madness of

393
00:23:15.191 --> 00:23:18.970
yours,
you know,
cause you're so into like weird.
We were all like,

394
00:23:19.060 --> 00:23:22.330
we went to lunch before your fight and it was me and like five of my friends.

395
00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:23.520
Dwayne didn't give a fuck.

396
00:23:23.540 --> 00:23:25.350
<v 5>Would anybody else talking about he was,</v>

397
00:23:25.580 --> 00:23:29.600
he was on strategy movement.
He was breaking shit.

398
00:23:30.190 --> 00:23:32.890
<v 3>That's what I said in all my interviews is because he cares about his job as</v>

399
00:23:32.891 --> 00:23:35.590
much as I do is why this works.
If he goes home,

400
00:23:35.830 --> 00:23:38.590
I'll get home after a hard day of practice.
Right.
Even when I worked at like two,

401
00:23:38.591 --> 00:23:40.840
three times,
get home and just want to veg out.

402
00:23:40.841 --> 00:23:43.570
Watch some TV and like thinking about not fighting at all.

403
00:23:43.630 --> 00:23:46.070
Anything else about fighting and then he'll text me on something I should

404
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:49.220
<v 1>be doing for my fight or he watching her brows fight and things I could do in</v>

405
00:23:49.221 --> 00:23:50.054
the fight and was like,

406
00:23:50.210 --> 00:23:53.660
God damn and I gotta I gotta like thinking about the fight go run and like get

407
00:23:53.661 --> 00:23:55.640
all amped up.
It's was like,
yeah,
you're right.
I can't get through that,

408
00:23:55.670 --> 00:23:58.430
so I need to do,
so he's making me think about the fight 24 seven,

409
00:23:58.431 --> 00:23:59.720
which helps me out a lot.

410
00:23:59.721 --> 00:24:01.880
I mean I get in those situations in the fight and he's like,

411
00:24:01.910 --> 00:24:04.610
I've already been there before.
Wow.
That's incredible.

412
00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:08.540
I wonder how long you guys can keep this up forever.
It's so crazy.

413
00:24:08.550 --> 00:24:09.750
Like so manner.

414
00:24:12.670 --> 00:24:16.990
<v 6>Definitely a good mix for sure.
The best mix.
Hundred percent.
Yeah.</v>

415
00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:19.450
I don't know if,
uh,
if it was kind of a destiny and meant to be,

416
00:24:19.451 --> 00:24:23.050
to make sure like where our paths cross or create your destiny.

417
00:24:23.051 --> 00:24:24.640
If it's already predetermined.
I'm not too sure,

418
00:24:24.641 --> 00:24:27.160
but this is the working out like as if it was meant to be.

419
00:24:27.230 --> 00:24:31.010
<v 0>Well,
you as a trainer,
you've really fallen into this role.
Was such a passion,</v>

420
00:24:31.011 --> 00:24:35.210
you know,
it's so cool to see because for a lot of fighters they,

421
00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:40.240
they develop all this technique and they have all this knowledge and they get so

422
00:24:40.671 --> 00:24:43.040
much better at training,
but then as they start to get older,

423
00:24:43.490 --> 00:24:45.020
their body just doesn't work the same anymore.

424
00:24:45.021 --> 00:24:49.040
And there's a certain amount of time he can put into fighting and competing when

425
00:24:49.041 --> 00:24:53.300
you know you could Randy coture it if you're a freak,
but he's a rare,
rare dude.

426
00:24:53.330 --> 00:24:54.320
He's a rare guy.

427
00:24:54.321 --> 00:24:57.680
I don't know how he did that and nobody knows how he did that deep into his 40

428
00:24:57.681 --> 00:25:01.970
still competing at a super high level,
just a bad animal,
just a savage.

429
00:25:02.270 --> 00:25:05.180
But for most guys,
at a certain point in time,

430
00:25:05.210 --> 00:25:08.090
they have to find an exit strategy and it becomes a very difficult time for
them.

431
00:25:08.330 --> 00:25:12.680
But for you,
you seem to have found this perfect blend of right when your career,

432
00:25:12.681 --> 00:25:16.610
when you started to slow down,
boom,
you take over the spot about it.

433
00:25:16.611 --> 00:25:19.010
There's very little gap time in between the two.

434
00:25:19.190 --> 00:25:21.520
Like you could take a fight right now,
like if you want to do,

435
00:25:21.540 --> 00:25:23.970
like if somebody offered you a fight right now,
you get,
you're in shape,
you,

436
00:25:24.020 --> 00:25:26.360
you could just do a six week camp.
It's still do a fight.

437
00:25:26.510 --> 00:25:28.610
So it's not like everybody was saying like,
man,

438
00:25:28.611 --> 00:25:30.470
Duane Ludwig's gotta hang up the gloves.
Gotcha.

439
00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:35.030
You were still in the game and you decided to start training fighters and you

440
00:25:35.031 --> 00:25:37.340
seem to have just won't just hit the gas.

441
00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:39.010
<v 6>It's what I've been kind of looking to do.</v>

442
00:25:39.011 --> 00:25:42.160
I've been training guys since I was 19 anyway.
Um,

443
00:25:42.161 --> 00:25:46.220
I was actually one of a hoarder for Mr. Boss threw in a sense they boss rooting

444
00:25:46.221 --> 00:25:49.330
for is random and fight when he was in Colorado.
So I learned a lot.
Then also,

445
00:25:49.331 --> 00:25:50.920
and I don't know how know us are 24,

446
00:25:50.921 --> 00:25:55.590
25 but it's something I have naturally been doing anyways since I was 19 and the

447
00:25:55.590 --> 00:25:56.550
last couple of years my fighting,
I was just fighting.

448
00:25:56.551 --> 00:25:58.960
It kind of just stay busy and for a paycheck and not to get a regular job.

449
00:25:58.961 --> 00:26:02.470
So if I,
sorry,
I slowed down relaxed.
I get excited,

450
00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:07.780
passionate.
So I know,
I know it's as fast as my brain goes.
So let me think.
Uh,
uh,

451
00:26:07.810 --> 00:26:11.020
it was just if I had this opportunity to do it,
you know,
a couple of years prior,

452
00:26:11.021 --> 00:26:13.630
I probably would have,
uh,
but you know,
it wasn't the right time then.

453
00:26:13.630 --> 00:26:16.960
That's why there's the way that the chain of events that happened,
you know.
Um,
I,

454
00:26:17.150 --> 00:26:18.610
I couldn't actually take a fight.

455
00:26:18.611 --> 00:26:20.590
My knees still pretty jacked up from last fight got blew out.

456
00:26:20.591 --> 00:26:22.310
My knee got blown out.
So it's kind of,

457
00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:26.140
I was in a position where I had three months worth of pay and a year long
injury,

458
00:26:26.170 --> 00:26:26.650
you know,

459
00:26:26.650 --> 00:26:29.200
and then a favorite texts me when I was a cage when Dwayne is a steering number.

460
00:26:29.201 --> 00:26:30.250
And I was like,
yeah,

461
00:26:30.251 --> 00:26:32.050
and then give him the opportunity to come and work with these guys.

462
00:26:32.051 --> 00:26:34.200
And I was handed a parking lot full,

463
00:26:34.201 --> 00:26:37.220
the race cars and asked to take them to the race.
You know,
that's the band.

464
00:26:37.590 --> 00:26:39.970
It's just been an awesome,
awesome ride.

465
00:26:39.971 --> 00:26:42.490
And it's literally like playing a video game.

466
00:26:42.550 --> 00:26:44.190
A hundred percent control controller works

467
00:26:44.190 --> 00:26:45.300
<v 7>and you hit the right keys on the right.</v>

468
00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:47.550
Right time is literally like playing a video game.

469
00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:50.520
She said to me after the fight and Sir your exact words,

470
00:26:50.521 --> 00:26:53.520
that's how I see it and I'm just a child at heart.
I guess that's a quick,

471
00:26:53.521 --> 00:26:54.470
it's an allergy and I was like,

472
00:26:54.660 --> 00:26:58.290
I know people say I'd like that brotherly love but I genuinely care for my guys

473
00:26:58.291 --> 00:27:01.320
and I love them.
Like my kids have faber's done an amazing,

474
00:27:01.340 --> 00:27:05.400
he has putting together a wild camp of barbarians on up there.

475
00:27:05.430 --> 00:27:07.320
He just kind of draws in these people too.

476
00:27:07.321 --> 00:27:09.810
It's not like he went out searching for all these great training partners,

477
00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:11.490
just his personality in general.

478
00:27:11.491 --> 00:27:14.900
The person he is kind of just like attracted everyone to that camp,
you know,

479
00:27:14.970 --> 00:27:16.350
tried recruiting me when I was in wrestling.

480
00:27:16.351 --> 00:27:20.140
I didn't go up to Davis and and wrestle where he was at after I graduated at

481
00:27:20.141 --> 00:27:22.220
school.
It just kind of,
I just migrated up there.

482
00:27:22.410 --> 00:27:25.760
Munoz kind of pushed me that way,
you know,
and just kind of happen.
Wow.

483
00:27:26.310 --> 00:27:29.610
As long as you can stick it out and be pretty gangster in the gym,

484
00:27:29.611 --> 00:27:32.010
then you're going to work at eight,
you're going to get really good,
you know,

485
00:27:32.011 --> 00:27:33.870
otherwise you're gonna get your butt kicked in.
You're probably gonna leave,

486
00:27:33.871 --> 00:27:35.790
you know,
off enough to,

487
00:27:36.090 --> 00:27:39.390
to good disbarring rooms and we'll throw it down,
you know?

488
00:27:39.391 --> 00:27:42.480
And if you're able to stick it out,
then you're going to get a lot better.
Yeah.

489
00:27:42.481 --> 00:27:45.270
That is the thing.
Whether or not God's can stick it out,
but it's just,

490
00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:49.470
it's amazing that he's been able to inspire so many gods to go to this one area.

491
00:27:49.770 --> 00:27:53.910
And if you know your Ryo,
he's a,
he's a unique dude.
He's very smart,

492
00:27:54.210 --> 00:27:58.770
very smart.
And he's also like super motivated and driven.

493
00:27:59.340 --> 00:28:02.710
You know,
if you read his book is pretty interesting.
And,
um,

494
00:28:02.730 --> 00:28:04.920
one of the things that I talked to him about it when I interviewed him for the

495
00:28:04.921 --> 00:28:08.880
UFC was how he'll write things down and look at them like first thing in the

496
00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:09.540
morning when he wakes up,

497
00:28:09.540 --> 00:28:12.270
we'll have like a list of things that he wants to accomplish,

498
00:28:12.271 --> 00:28:13.620
the list of things he's trying to do.

499
00:28:13.980 --> 00:28:17.670
And like having a guy like that around very inspirational because you want to do

500
00:28:17.671 --> 00:28:19.950
the same kind of things,
copycat method,
you know,

501
00:28:20.670 --> 00:28:23.070
I think he's gotten all that from the book.
The secret.

502
00:28:23.460 --> 00:28:27.060
You kind of learned the way of like setting goals and setting the way you should

503
00:28:27.061 --> 00:28:29.130
live your life and it's just worked out,
you know?
And uh,

504
00:28:29.190 --> 00:28:33.000
this secret is kind of bullshit,
but not,
it gives you,

505
00:28:33.001 --> 00:28:36.130
it gives you the right path I think.
I think it's something motivational,

506
00:28:36.150 --> 00:28:40.900
you know,
it's better than,
it's something created for positive lake,
you know,

507
00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:44.340
likeness on something.
So,
and it's a positive thing just helping people.
So I,

508
00:28:44.341 --> 00:28:46.770
I'm a fan of it for sure.
But I know what you mean though.

509
00:28:46.771 --> 00:28:50.160
It is similar bullshit too.
Yeah.
Good,
good.
Pros and cons to it,

510
00:28:50.161 --> 00:28:53.970
but like anything yet is motivational.
Right.
And anything motivational is good.

511
00:28:53.971 --> 00:28:55.860
If you could find motivation in that to be good.
Yeah.

512
00:28:56.130 --> 00:28:58.710
It's just like it only works on the people that works on,

513
00:28:58.740 --> 00:29:01.220
do you know what I'm saying?
Like for you,
the secret work,
look,

514
00:29:01.290 --> 00:29:04.230
you're the world champion now.
You know what I'm saying?
Like if you could,

515
00:29:04.260 --> 00:29:08.130
if you were in a a documentary on the secret and you were like,

516
00:29:08.310 --> 00:29:11.670
I just knew that I could make this happen and I concentrated on it every day,

517
00:29:11.671 --> 00:29:14.310
and I'm sure I put it a little,
a lot of hard work in,

518
00:29:14.311 --> 00:29:17.940
but the law of attraction is what led you to that victory.
People would go,

519
00:29:17.941 --> 00:29:21.240
oh my God,
the secrets real,
and then it would try it out themselves.
Like saying,

520
00:29:21.270 --> 00:29:23.160
I want to breathe underwater.
I want to be ACO man,

521
00:29:23.161 --> 00:29:25.500
or someone just gonna concentrate on this.
I'm going to make,
no,

522
00:29:25.501 --> 00:29:27.390
you're not going to make it happen.
There's certain laws of physics.

523
00:29:27.420 --> 00:29:28.680
It goes back to the copycat method.

524
00:29:28.681 --> 00:29:31.590
I guess you're just copying someone else that was successful and well,

525
00:29:32.430 --> 00:29:36.510
my point was that it does work in that it works for people works on,

526
00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:38.550
but it doesn't work for everybody.

527
00:29:38.551 --> 00:29:42.190
Like there are people that have started out and really poor families

528
00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:46.510
<v 0>in bad neighborhoods and they've gone on to become super wealthy and successful</v>

529
00:29:46.630 --> 00:29:48.300
and they've,
you know,
they're,
they're,

530
00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:51.160
they're helping a lot of people and starting charities and things.

531
00:29:51.190 --> 00:29:52.630
It does happen sometimes,

532
00:29:52.990 --> 00:29:56.320
but it also happens that people just get fucked over and they wind up in

533
00:29:56.321 --> 00:29:59.860
terrible situations and you can't blame those people that are in the worst

534
00:29:59.861 --> 00:30:02.920
situation that it's all just about the way they thought about things.

535
00:30:02.921 --> 00:30:04.960
Right now you get lucky breaks in life.

536
00:30:05.050 --> 00:30:07.870
So it's sort of a combination of those things.
Like,
yeah,

537
00:30:07.871 --> 00:30:09.930
if you make all the right decisions and you get a bunch of lucky,

538
00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:12.400
lucky breaks and you don't get hit by a fucking truck way,

539
00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:16.630
I'm trying to cross the street,
you can be really successful.

540
00:30:16.870 --> 00:30:20.430
But it's also,
there's a lot of randomness involved in this universe.

541
00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:23.050
You've got to kind of,
if you don't acknowledge that randomness,

542
00:30:23.170 --> 00:30:26.440
people get mad at you.
Like people,
people get upset at you.

543
00:30:26.470 --> 00:30:26.800
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

544
00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:29.440
Just his overall general message of doing something positive and directing your

545
00:30:29.441 --> 00:30:31.910
life to a certain direction and get the results you want.
Yeah.

546
00:30:32.050 --> 00:30:36.550
It's just when it becomes a system like this,
this will work.
Well that's funny.

547
00:30:36.551 --> 00:30:37.540
Sad cause uh,
you know,

548
00:30:37.590 --> 00:30:41.980
as random finding is but split seconds or fractions of an inch.
I've taken,

549
00:30:42.270 --> 00:30:43.450
you know,
not completely,

550
00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:47.410
but I was able to take some parts of fighting and make it a system and that's

551
00:30:47.411 --> 00:30:50.530
when things that we train off of certain numbers of commands and queues so we

552
00:30:50.531 --> 00:30:53.920
can speak while they're in the cage or on the pants are spying.
So yeah,

553
00:30:54.340 --> 00:30:59.020
that's one of my tricky things in life right now is taking something so random

554
00:30:59.021 --> 00:30:59.680
is fighting it,

555
00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:03.250
putting it into a system so that we can't predict the patterns and you know,

556
00:31:03.251 --> 00:31:06.080
get used to what's coming,
what may be coming next to the counter and or,

557
00:31:06.170 --> 00:31:07.930
or predictive counter and things like that as well.

558
00:31:08.170 --> 00:31:13.000
<v 0>And this is something that exists in boxing but is even more important when you</v>

559
00:31:13.001 --> 00:31:15.100
add in the extra limbs have more time.
Right.

560
00:31:15.340 --> 00:31:20.340
Like there's more like technique becomes in a lot of ways it's much more of a

561
00:31:21.191 --> 00:31:25.900
balancing act than it is in boxing and boxing speed and athleticism or so

562
00:31:25.901 --> 00:31:27.040
dominating that.

563
00:31:27.041 --> 00:31:30.610
A lot of fighters that maybe don't have the best technique have really good

564
00:31:30.611 --> 00:31:34.390
speed and athleticism and there'll be a more technical fighter who's slower but

565
00:31:34.391 --> 00:31:35.740
in,
in Moy Tai,

566
00:31:35.770 --> 00:31:39.670
there's so much distance involved in so many other techniques and so many,

567
00:31:39.730 --> 00:31:43.810
so many options and possibilities that are really technical fighter.
You know,

568
00:31:43.811 --> 00:31:48.790
like Amir said,
dolla good example,
right.
And mirsa dolls,
a real technical guy,

569
00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:51.760
but not a physically strong guy by any stretch of the imagination.

570
00:31:51.761 --> 00:31:52.900
Not a super athlete,

571
00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:57.940
just a regular guy but became pretty technical with is more time,
you know,

572
00:31:58.060 --> 00:32:00.610
for sure.
And he could beat guys who are a lot faster and stronger.

573
00:32:00.730 --> 00:32:02.980
<v 6>Yeah,
he had definitely a good base.
And then retire for sure.</v>

574
00:32:03.220 --> 00:32:05.920
<v 0>I wanted to talk to you about your system because you're the,</v>

575
00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:10.060
like as far as the people that I know that I've really spent the most time

576
00:32:10.061 --> 00:32:14.140
trying to break things down into,
I know the Dutch do it a lot and uh,

577
00:32:14.141 --> 00:32:18.340
I had the pleasure of training with rob came in several times and he's a very

578
00:32:18.341 --> 00:32:21.400
good guy and he has a whole system that he teaches,
you know,

579
00:32:21.401 --> 00:32:26.260
he's got this Cayman Moitai system cool that he,
uh,

580
00:32:26.280 --> 00:32:26.671
is,

581
00:32:26.671 --> 00:32:31.671
he's basically in a lot of ways like you as kind of sort of broken down all the

582
00:32:31.691 --> 00:32:33.730
various possibilities that can happen in a fight.

583
00:32:33.731 --> 00:32:35.950
But I think you've done a another level.

584
00:32:35.951 --> 00:32:39.870
You've taken it to even wackier place where you just,
you know,
you're

585
00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:42.250
<v 7>thinking about it all.
God Damn Day came in part,</v>

586
00:32:42.260 --> 00:32:44.590
doesn't even know his own Combo and [inaudible] test system.

587
00:32:45.430 --> 00:32:48.440
We have a comma that's named after him.
He doesn't even know it.

588
00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:52.250
Is it a round kick across the front of the size and helps.

589
00:32:52.370 --> 00:32:54.100
He loves that technique,
man.

590
00:32:54.590 --> 00:32:58.520
He would throw that that round kick across the front of the thighs of both legs

591
00:32:59.090 --> 00:33:01.400
all the time.
And that's a beautiful technique.

592
00:33:01.460 --> 00:33:03.740
He liked to some of the fights that I've seen,

593
00:33:03.741 --> 00:33:07.770
he would pick the front kick and come down to the hook off that same time that

594
00:33:07.970 --> 00:33:10.190
came in to come down at the same side Hook.
Yeah.

595
00:33:10.191 --> 00:33:14.450
That was another technique is he would just crappy,
hard hook,
solid hug for sure.

596
00:33:14.510 --> 00:33:18.650
I love,
oh sorry.
I was just going to say I love watching old rob came and fucked.

597
00:33:18.651 --> 00:33:21.020
Yes.
I bought his uh,
his VHS,

598
00:33:21.290 --> 00:33:25.100
VHS instruction and I aced it and just take notes on those and watch those all

599
00:33:25.100 --> 00:33:25.310
day long.

600
00:33:25.310 --> 00:33:28.310
Like I just obsessed about that stuff and my style is based more off the judge

601
00:33:28.311 --> 00:33:29.960
stop because it's coming up to Boston route and stuff.

602
00:33:30.770 --> 00:33:33.440
You guys haven't figured out if,
sorry,
I can't even hear myself.

603
00:33:33.441 --> 00:33:35.780
No one's figured out.
If you want to be a really good coach,

604
00:33:35.781 --> 00:33:37.820
you have to be a psychopath to Oh,
you have to be,

605
00:33:38.270 --> 00:33:41.870
you have to be a little twisted to get what he's figuring out inside the head.

606
00:33:41.871 --> 00:33:43.600
And he's always got something going on then.
Well,

607
00:33:43.620 --> 00:33:47.000
you have to be twisted to be a competitor to you or you come off.

608
00:33:47.030 --> 00:33:49.730
You're an interesting guy because you come off like the sweetest,

609
00:33:49.731 --> 00:33:54.720
kindest guy in the world,
but however I hear training with you is not,

610
00:33:55.610 --> 00:33:59.530
not not a an ice cream Sundae.
I guys pick your partners.

611
00:33:59.780 --> 00:34:03.350
Who's working with Tj?
Hey,
did you sign the liability waiver?
Yeah.
Okay,
cool.

612
00:34:03.351 --> 00:34:06.170
We're good.
Start around.
I'm always the last one to get a partner.

613
00:34:07.100 --> 00:34:10.400
No one wants to play with me.
Do you think that,

614
00:34:10.410 --> 00:34:14.720
I mean is it because you're so amped up and competitive and you only turn it on

615
00:34:14.721 --> 00:34:17.870
in competition and when you're in there you're just in there to go to war.

616
00:34:18.260 --> 00:34:20.630
You're not in there to make nice,
nice.

617
00:34:20.631 --> 00:34:24.200
You just seem to go to war and that's the only way to get better.
I'm super

618
00:34:25.710 --> 00:34:29.930
nice guy.
He loves it.
He used to watch,
I can watch UFC fights all day long.

619
00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:31.280
He controls me like he's been,

620
00:34:31.281 --> 00:34:33.740
we've been trying to get this controlled aggression that I have is I'm very

621
00:34:33.741 --> 00:34:37.760
aggressive when I'm competing because I'm really competitive and I want to be

622
00:34:37.761 --> 00:34:39.020
the best in the world.
So I'm practice.

623
00:34:39.021 --> 00:34:40.910
I want to practice the best to be the best.

624
00:34:40.910 --> 00:34:43.130
And when things don't work out exactly the way it's supposed to,

625
00:34:43.131 --> 00:34:46.040
I get pissed and go harder and it's something he's had to control with me.

626
00:34:46.041 --> 00:34:46.730
You know,
I've,

627
00:34:46.730 --> 00:34:49.820
I've learned to control my aggression and turn on at the right times,

628
00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:51.530
but it's taken a long time to do that.

629
00:34:51.531 --> 00:34:54.030
So everyone's got this name for me as being,
you know,

630
00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:58.070
the bully and the gym cause it goes hard.
He definitely goes hard,

631
00:34:58.250 --> 00:35:01.880
but he's got what can't be taught.
So I just got to be controlled as all.
Yeah.

632
00:35:01.881 --> 00:35:04.640
It's simply a matter of how much damage you,

633
00:35:04.650 --> 00:35:08.270
you take this unnecessary or give out that's unnecessary in the training.

634
00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:12.800
But other than that,
to have that mad intensity,
that is what it takes.

635
00:35:12.830 --> 00:35:16.370
There's only one way to be a champion.
You can't be a champion and kind of,

636
00:35:16.580 --> 00:35:20.330
well you know,
I'll give it my best.
You can't.
Nope.
The doctorate,

637
00:35:20.750 --> 00:35:24.320
there's other dudes out there like Tj Dillashaw.
That's just the way it is.

638
00:35:24.321 --> 00:35:27.590
Like that's what I would tell people whenever anyone talks about dabbling in

639
00:35:27.591 --> 00:35:31.070
fighting,
you know,
they,
they say,
hey,
why don't you have an MMA fight?
You know,

640
00:35:31.220 --> 00:35:33.110
they,
you know,
we should have an MMA fight,
that guy,

641
00:35:33.111 --> 00:35:35.840
but he can kick some ass listened to me and less.

642
00:35:35.841 --> 00:35:38.130
That's what you're obsessed with.

643
00:35:38.340 --> 00:35:41.250
<v 0>Unless that is occupying your thoughts 24 hours a day.</v>

644
00:35:41.550 --> 00:35:44.130
And when people start talking to you,
if you don't like what they're saying,

645
00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:46.500
you start thinking about fighting unless that's going on,

646
00:35:46.620 --> 00:35:50.250
don't fight because there's someone out there like Tj Dillashaw this,

647
00:35:50.251 --> 00:35:54.180
these motherfuckers out there that are like that all day long and they will get

648
00:35:54.181 --> 00:35:58.280
in the same cage as you and light you on fire and there's not a goddamn thing

649
00:35:58.281 --> 00:35:59.580
you can do about it.
That's true.

650
00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:02.220
That's some people's journey and they just want to go through the process of a

651
00:36:02.221 --> 00:36:05.580
fight camp,
physical fight,
just to experience it.
That's until I guess,
fuck,
relax.

652
00:36:05.850 --> 00:36:10.260
So maybe if they get the right match up or somebody who is equally as skilled or

653
00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:12.300
just for they have the event,
then it's fine.
But yeah,
definitely.

654
00:36:12.301 --> 00:36:14.210
You don't want to come across someone like to date another shot.

655
00:36:14.210 --> 00:36:18.060
He's a world class athlete that's dedicated and that will kill you.
Yeah,

656
00:36:18.061 --> 00:36:20.400
and you could have run into a gallery out in the amateurs.

657
00:36:20.401 --> 00:36:23.890
You can easily run into,
yeah,
I had two amateur fights.
Yeah.

658
00:36:24.210 --> 00:36:27.150
I was obviously not as mature.
Yeah,
you weren't as good,

659
00:36:27.151 --> 00:36:30.210
but still you could run into some,

660
00:36:30.450 --> 00:36:34.740
especially due to that freaky power guys would have that Lavard Johnson type

661
00:36:34.741 --> 00:36:37.890
power.
You could run into those dudes and you're going to check,

662
00:36:38.550 --> 00:36:42.060
your head's going to be fucked up for a long time just because you wanted an

663
00:36:42.061 --> 00:36:43.840
adventure.
Yeah.
Be careful.
Yeah.

664
00:36:46.630 --> 00:36:48.750
He's got to research your opponent.
You got to.
You should be.

665
00:36:48.810 --> 00:36:51.510
I think martial arts are a great thing to be involved with.

666
00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:56.040
If you're going to fight in MMA,
you better be goddamn obsessed.
Yeah.

667
00:36:56.370 --> 00:37:00.630
That's why I think this combination of youtube is so fascinating to me because

668
00:37:00.631 --> 00:37:01.710
you're both bananas.

669
00:37:02.580 --> 00:37:06.280
You're both upset like there should be some scientific studies going on,
man.

670
00:37:06.281 --> 00:37:09.960
Yeah.
Maybe there's some data that can be pulled from the early fights and the

671
00:37:09.961 --> 00:37:13.110
coaching videos and stuff like that up until now because I'm curious to see all

672
00:37:13.111 --> 00:37:16.560
the improvements involvements that just the improvements of every aspect of the

673
00:37:16.561 --> 00:37:17.251
game.
Well,

674
00:37:17.251 --> 00:37:20.220
there's so many improvements behind the scenes and a lot of folks don't know

675
00:37:20.221 --> 00:37:24.480
about like how to train what like there's all these like different thoughts and

676
00:37:24.481 --> 00:37:29.100
strategies about fa training it out to two or sleeping it out suit and training.

677
00:37:29.250 --> 00:37:31.890
Now it's now that's what they say.
Train at sea level,

678
00:37:31.950 --> 00:37:36.000
sleep at altitude and that has a pretty significant impact and then your diet.

679
00:37:36.170 --> 00:37:38.550
If guys are like,
oh,
let's get out the gluten.
Okay,

680
00:37:38.551 --> 00:37:42.550
we're going to do today we're going to do Tabata training protocols.

681
00:37:42.660 --> 00:37:43.740
What do you think about gluten?

682
00:37:44.640 --> 00:37:47.190
I think that it's not the best thing for your body.

683
00:37:47.191 --> 00:37:50.700
It's fucking glue or you're taking your breaking wheat down.

684
00:37:50.850 --> 00:37:54.180
It's turning it into let's just chew,
like when you eat bread,

685
00:37:54.450 --> 00:37:59.070
chew that shit up and feel what it feels like.
It's glue and glue.

686
00:37:59.100 --> 00:38:01.290
I've never really looked into it as much because I'm able to eat.

687
00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:03.540
Like I eat healthy and I eat really healthy.

688
00:38:03.541 --> 00:38:07.320
It just for the Diet makes me feel good and Google's never has ever bothered me

689
00:38:07.321 --> 00:38:08.070
before.

690
00:38:08.070 --> 00:38:11.520
And Danny Castillo has gotten as gluten free diet and he's like really strict

691
00:38:11.521 --> 00:38:14.400
about it.
I always make fun of him and I,
you know how he's going to ship.

692
00:38:14.410 --> 00:38:16.800
I would go somewhere he can't eat anything.
He was like,
come on man,

693
00:38:16.980 --> 00:38:19.820
I'll pay extra for that gluten.
Give me extra gluten and then I'll eat it,

694
00:38:19.821 --> 00:38:22.830
you know?
But uh,
I don't think it's bad for you.
I've tried gluten free.

695
00:38:22.831 --> 00:38:27.300
I was gluten free for a long time and then I allow myself to eat at once a week,

696
00:38:27.570 --> 00:38:29.870
which they say you're not supposed to do if you're really gluten free is

697
00:38:29.871 --> 00:38:33.360
supposed to be gluten free 100% but what I think is,
it's like a lot of things,

698
00:38:33.361 --> 00:38:37.990
it's like beer.
It's like bread,
the the,
it's like cake.

699
00:38:38.170 --> 00:38:41.140
It's not good for you,
but I like it anyway.
I got like a little bit of it.

700
00:38:41.141 --> 00:38:44.290
I think you should for the most part,
taking things that are really good for you.

701
00:38:44.620 --> 00:38:47.170
But I think gluten isn't,
it's just,

702
00:38:47.350 --> 00:38:51.550
it causes inflammation and it's difficult to digest just a little bit,
not a lot.

703
00:38:51.551 --> 00:38:52.840
And for some people it's a lot.

704
00:38:52.841 --> 00:38:55.250
Some people have like CELIAC's disease and check the,

705
00:38:55.330 --> 00:38:56.760
for those people it's pretty significant.

706
00:38:56.780 --> 00:38:59.140
You feel worse when you have that day of like the next day.
Do you feel worse?

707
00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:04.800
I feel like a fat fuck.
Yeah.
Feel,
feel like watered down.
I feel like raw.

708
00:39:04.830 --> 00:39:09.250
Like when Ali Ead,
um,
uh,
I'll,
I'll eat a sandwich or something like that,

709
00:39:09.251 --> 00:39:12.640
like a meatball sub or something fucking stupid on my cheat day.

710
00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:15.830
And that bond soaked up with spaghetti sauce,

711
00:39:15.850 --> 00:39:19.990
just sits in my stomach like a rock face.
So good though.
So good.

712
00:39:19.991 --> 00:39:22.960
When it's going down for a few moments of simple Mt.
Pleasure.

713
00:39:22.961 --> 00:39:27.310
I'll allow myself like shit for 24 hours.
You feel it when you work out too.

714
00:39:27.370 --> 00:39:30.070
That's when I feel it,
it takes a longer time to digest for me.

715
00:39:30.340 --> 00:39:34.720
If I eat like just standard protein,
you know,
like fish and vegetables.

716
00:39:35.160 --> 00:39:40.060
It doesn't take me long to digest a nice plate of a healthy fish and uh,
some,

717
00:39:40.061 --> 00:39:44.770
some Greens like Kale or you know,
uh,
any ruble or some shit like that,

718
00:39:44.980 --> 00:39:47.650
that's like two,
three hours later I feel great I can work out.

719
00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:51.660
But if I eat like a pizza,
I'm fucked for a while.
Yup.

720
00:39:52.210 --> 00:39:56.410
I'm fucked for five or six hours.
It's not gonna be any working out pizza.

721
00:39:56.420 --> 00:39:59.860
And now that I eat healthy,
I can fill the huge difference that you eaten bad.

722
00:39:59.861 --> 00:40:02.680
But it's because I've gotten into the profession of what I do,

723
00:40:02.710 --> 00:40:05.620
gives me money and since I've been blending all my fruit and vegetables,

724
00:40:05.710 --> 00:40:08.260
it's insane how much I can eat vegetable wise.

725
00:40:08.261 --> 00:40:10.570
Like if I blend it up in the BLENDTEC I got like,

726
00:40:10.870 --> 00:40:14.050
it's like I eight times as much fruit and vegetables.

727
00:40:14.050 --> 00:40:16.600
I used to when I was wrestling just because I make a blend once a day.

728
00:40:16.660 --> 00:40:20.910
That's so awesome.
It's so good for you.
As long as you mix it up.
Um,

729
00:40:21.130 --> 00:40:22.520
I've been reading about people that,

730
00:40:22.540 --> 00:40:26.830
that do run into issues if they eat all of their meals as blended vegetables.

731
00:40:27.090 --> 00:40:30.700
He used to like if you get a certain amount of oxalic acid and a bunch of

732
00:40:30.701 --> 00:40:34.210
different things that exist in um,
in plants too.

733
00:40:34.211 --> 00:40:36.850
I probably did discourage animals from eating them.

734
00:40:36.940 --> 00:40:39.790
But if you have been massive doses like that,
like over and over again,

735
00:40:39.791 --> 00:40:43.360
like spinach,
apparently raw spinach,
very high in oxalic acid,

736
00:40:43.500 --> 00:40:45.310
but as long as you mix it up it's fine.

737
00:40:45.340 --> 00:40:47.080
And as long as you have calcium in your diet,

738
00:40:47.110 --> 00:40:51.880
calcium in your diet sends to mitigate it in some way.
But there's no,

739
00:40:51.910 --> 00:40:55.540
there's no better way.
It's like you're getting like mainline and nutrients.

740
00:40:56.230 --> 00:40:58.060
I drink one of those cal shakes dude.

741
00:40:58.061 --> 00:41:01.120
And I feel like I did fucking like two shots of espresso,

742
00:41:01.900 --> 00:41:04.700
fire it up in the morning.
Every morning when I'm at home,
I have,

743
00:41:04.701 --> 00:41:07.750
I have a green shake for the morning also and blend that puppy up and just chomp

744
00:41:07.751 --> 00:41:09.850
it down back to honor it.
If you want it to taste good,

745
00:41:09.851 --> 00:41:13.540
you just got to put the hemp force in advance.
Everything blend up dog shit.

746
00:41:13.541 --> 00:41:18.140
And he was like,
seriously?
That's the Stevia,
the what we use for sweetness.

747
00:41:18.141 --> 00:41:21.230
So this shit the same stuff that I use on my,
uh,
you thought it was salt?
Yeah.

748
00:41:21.670 --> 00:41:25.630
The same stuff that I use in my,
um,
my coffee.
It's a natural plant.
Extract,

749
00:41:25.631 --> 00:41:29.470
no sugar in it at all and you just need a tiny little bit.
It's super potent,

750
00:41:29.650 --> 00:41:34.160
like 10 times more potent than sugar.
Definitely.
Um,
but yeah man,
when

751
00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:37.540
<v 7>I,
when I used to make it taste good,
but now I don't even make the Kale shake.</v>

752
00:41:37.550 --> 00:41:39.490
Tastes good anymore.
Now I'm making it,

753
00:41:39.930 --> 00:41:44.210
I make it taste terrible cause I give a giant chunks of ginger and garlic now

754
00:41:44.560 --> 00:41:49.270
like I'll have like a series,
like remember what pages you still look like page,

755
00:41:49.350 --> 00:41:53.800
last chunk of ginger.
Just fucking hammer it.
Ooh,

756
00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:57.160
that's in one shake.
You slammed that,
that Messenger.
Oh fuck.

757
00:41:57.600 --> 00:42:01.000
I'm like that turtle was have about half of that in a week shake.
Oh really?
Yeah.

758
00:42:01.100 --> 00:42:05.820
No,
I slam it.
Slam it and four or five cloves of garlic to hitting a house.
No.

759
00:42:05.900 --> 00:42:09.980
So bad afterwards.
Smelling like garlic can take for sure.

760
00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:14.490
Well good look a yoke man.
I smelled like shit.

761
00:42:15.730 --> 00:42:20.270
Like garlic.
No,
just uh,
just ate some garlic.

762
00:42:20.271 --> 00:42:22.980
Your loads.
Yeah.
It's become horrible.
I don't know.
Why don't you try it.

763
00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:29.070
Let me know next time you were in,
say Stevie on it.
You'll be all right.
Thanks.

764
00:42:29.110 --> 00:42:31.730
Take me to take tests and mood to make a video.

765
00:42:32.920 --> 00:42:36.900
It's probably get a lot of youtube bits piss off of that.
Yeah.

766
00:42:37.940 --> 00:42:39.320
If you just all you'd have to do,

767
00:42:39.321 --> 00:42:42.830
it's just I would come on the desk and just dip your finger and go like that.

768
00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:47.770
That's all you would have to do.
And G,
P and g,

769
00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:53.720
it's over.
Youtube would break.

770
00:42:53.750 --> 00:42:56.630
I'm sure you've got the curdled kind where you could just pick it up.
No,

771
00:42:56.631 --> 00:43:01.580
my loads are very normal,
fertile time.
This shit took a lot of water,
dude.

772
00:43:01.690 --> 00:43:03.230
Oh,
that's true.
Healthy.

773
00:43:03.850 --> 00:43:08.720
My loads of quite fluid taste like garlic and this is like back at the,

774
00:43:08.780 --> 00:43:13.400
at the academy right here.
Imagine if we do,
we're like checks,

775
00:43:13.730 --> 00:43:17.090
whereas women have a certain amount of eggs and then that's it.
It's over.

776
00:43:17.330 --> 00:43:20.610
Imagine if dudes were like that.
We have a certain amount of loads,
you know,

777
00:43:21.490 --> 00:43:22.610
you like checking,

778
00:43:22.611 --> 00:43:26.010
you look uphold your balls up to the sun to see like where your load line was.

779
00:43:27.500 --> 00:43:30.260
A lot of people would have wasted,
a lot of people would have blue balls,

780
00:43:30.261 --> 00:43:33.770
that's for sure.
Saved my lows.

781
00:43:34.260 --> 00:43:39.050
Be like next day.
Oh Wow.
Girls will be like,

782
00:43:39.051 --> 00:43:42.020
come on gimme some low.
You're not worth it.

783
00:43:42.110 --> 00:43:44.900
You're not worth it to like a gambling.

784
00:43:45.790 --> 00:43:49.070
Rational guys would go and they'd go,
tantric,

785
00:43:49.071 --> 00:43:52.100
we squeeze it down to never really orgasm.
If that was the tip of your Dick,

786
00:43:52.250 --> 00:43:56.060
like a lighter.
And if that was the case,
if that was the case,
guys,

787
00:43:56.061 --> 00:43:59.570
you'd have more power and getting laid there on the girls side of it,
you know,

788
00:43:59.571 --> 00:44:01.070
like it's easy,
easier for a girl.

789
00:44:01.310 --> 00:44:04.520
It'd be a whole lot easier for a guy if you only had so many of us and if we all

790
00:44:04.521 --> 00:44:06.390
fucking band together,
we can make that happen.

791
00:44:10.310 --> 00:44:14.390
Just start this right now.
If the fuck guys,
puck as as powerful,

792
00:44:14.650 --> 00:44:15.730
have a Dick Union,

793
00:44:19.100 --> 00:44:23.870
take back your loads.
Your loads are important.

794
00:44:24.170 --> 00:44:27.000
They're not valued right now in the equation,
but damn it,
they should be.

795
00:44:27.050 --> 00:44:31.950
Stop wasting them.
It's a key ingredient in making people,
oh man.

796
00:44:32.130 --> 00:44:33.510
Without the loads,
you got nothing.

797
00:44:34.440 --> 00:44:37.290
That's the problem though is like that would be like starting a fighters' union.

798
00:44:37.580 --> 00:44:40.710
Like that's not really gonna Happen,
you know?
But this dude's like fuck down.

799
00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:43.710
That's what dudes would say when it comes to the Dick Union.

800
00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:47.160
If we all got together and said,
listen,
we're gonna,
we're gonna.

801
00:44:47.280 --> 00:44:49.540
We need to make our dicks more valuable.
Okay.

802
00:44:49.590 --> 00:44:52.850
When we need to make it harder to get to what's worked.
Something out here boys,

803
00:44:52.890 --> 00:44:54.960
the first ones are going to sacrifice big time,
man.

804
00:44:54.961 --> 00:44:56.040
The ones that are starting this thing.

805
00:44:56.041 --> 00:44:59.370
Cause now that they're the only ones not getting laid to start this whole trend,

806
00:44:59.371 --> 00:45:02.360
you know,
same as with the fighter union.
You only one not getting paid.
Right.

807
00:45:02.430 --> 00:45:05.280
They would be the ones who would step in and say,
you know,

808
00:45:05.310 --> 00:45:09.930
equal pay for equal fighting or something.
Oh,
people have in the past.

809
00:45:09.931 --> 00:45:12.710
I'm sure it's very difficult.
My point would be this like,

810
00:45:13.230 --> 00:45:15.870
it's like even comedians unions is now going to kill me.
I mean,

811
00:45:15.871 --> 00:45:20.310
I guess the condom maybe has been sort of,
I think there's something like that.

812
00:45:20.311 --> 00:45:22.650
There's some sort of a union that they tried to put together.

813
00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:26.060
Tj Dillashaw drinks a lot of water.
He's a healthy boy.

814
00:45:26.310 --> 00:45:29.160
How do you know Mike Epps is,
by the way,

815
00:45:29.190 --> 00:45:32.610
did you read that he beat up that other comedians can beat up a comedian for a

816
00:45:32.611 --> 00:45:35.690
joke that's hilarious.
Stole the joke.
No,

817
00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:38.560
the guy did a joke on his Instagram where he's,

818
00:45:38.910 --> 00:45:42.540
he snorted coke and uh,
he pretended he was Mike Epps.

819
00:45:42.541 --> 00:45:46.560
He did like a mic apps joke and then,
um,
uh,

820
00:45:46.590 --> 00:45:49.080
Mike apps and his boys beat the fuck out of him.

821
00:45:49.620 --> 00:45:52.880
I guess he was mocking the Kevin Hart field.
Yeah.
Yeah,

822
00:45:52.890 --> 00:45:56.940
because Kevin Hart and Mike Apps were in some sort of a beef,
uh,
Mike,

823
00:45:57.270 --> 00:46:00.660
Mike capps just talking shit about Kevin Hart and Kevin Hart made a video about

824
00:46:00.661 --> 00:46:01.860
it and said,
you know,

825
00:46:02.070 --> 00:46:05.910
you're not on my level and you need to up your ticket sales.
Hilarious.

826
00:46:05.911 --> 00:46:10.530
Kevin Hart's hilarious.
Uh,
I don't know who was,
you know what started it all?

827
00:46:10.560 --> 00:46:11.310
I have no idea.

828
00:46:11.310 --> 00:46:14.400
But apparently Mike apps didn't like what this guy did on his Instagram.

829
00:46:14.401 --> 00:46:18.120
Have you seen the video?
He did.
No,
it's available.
You can get it.
Pull it,

830
00:46:18.121 --> 00:46:22.710
pull it up.
It's off of his Instagram on the guy that got beat up.
Yeah.
He,
um,

831
00:46:23.070 --> 00:46:25.860
he did a video where you pretend to be microbes with coke all over his nose.

832
00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:30.360
And then he,
he did a Kevin Hart impression where he's on his knees.

833
00:46:31.620 --> 00:46:34.260
I mean,
it's not the best peace in the world.

834
00:46:37.260 --> 00:46:40.790
It's totally some people off,
Huh?
Did he take it down?
People are being sensitive.

835
00:46:40.791 --> 00:46:45.390
Is that,
where is it?
It's not that far away.
This is May.
Uh,

836
00:46:45.450 --> 00:46:49.120
well just try to find the video,
like do a search on it because it's a,

837
00:46:49.290 --> 00:46:52.860
it'll pop up really quickly.
Yeah,
it's fucked up man.

838
00:46:53.400 --> 00:46:56.820
Comedians hitting each other with jokes.
That's the most ridiculous thing ever.

839
00:46:57.350 --> 00:47:00.630
Especially if it's you.
If it's a guy who does coke,
if you do,
you do coke bitch.

840
00:47:00.660 --> 00:47:04.380
No Sir.
How can I mean?
I'm saying not you.
I mean if you do,

841
00:47:04.530 --> 00:47:07.260
you can't be mad if someone makes fun of you doing coke.
You know,

842
00:47:07.380 --> 00:47:11.700
like if someone did a video with me smoking weed,
what,
what am I going to say?

843
00:47:12.330 --> 00:47:16.950
That's how region.
Who are you?
What kind of fucking bullshit is this?

844
00:47:17.100 --> 00:47:18.460
I was afraid and come back from the bathroom.

845
00:47:18.490 --> 00:47:22.190
Everyone was getting beat up by doing Keven come to controlling,

846
00:47:22.920 --> 00:47:23.820
go to the bathroom.
I was,

847
00:47:23.821 --> 00:47:27.380
I got to make this quick cause the going to get pissed and they're like leaving

848
00:47:27.390 --> 00:47:30.440
Starbucks and you're like,
shit,
let everything be okay.

849
00:47:30.850 --> 00:47:32.470
<v 1>Some funny,
funny stories about Duane.</v>

850
00:47:32.471 --> 00:47:35.020
Like when I first started hanging out with him to go on UFC trips,
you know,

851
00:47:35.021 --> 00:47:37.810
and he's always on watch what people are talking about and just kind of like,

852
00:47:37.811 --> 00:47:38.790
you know,
kind of got this,

853
00:47:38.791 --> 00:47:43.510
this stand like someone's always talking shit kind of deal.
You know this,

854
00:47:43.511 --> 00:47:46.600
this guys just started working for the UFC and he's given us a ride to the

855
00:47:46.601 --> 00:47:49.600
grocery store to pick up our healthy stuff for the week and to keep it in our

856
00:47:49.601 --> 00:47:51.280
room and Dwayne's talking,

857
00:47:51.310 --> 00:47:54.670
he's telling a story and this guy interrupts him a couple times,
you know?

858
00:47:54.671 --> 00:47:57.310
And I can see Dwayne get pissed about it.
And like I just,

859
00:47:57.311 --> 00:47:59.230
I only know Dwayne now for like a month,
maybe two.

860
00:47:59.231 --> 00:48:02.020
And he's out my first fight and like I'm nervous,
you know,

861
00:48:02.021 --> 00:48:04.660
cause like he yeah it comes across really harsh to people.

862
00:48:04.661 --> 00:48:07.240
But if you understand his personality,
he's joking,

863
00:48:07.540 --> 00:48:10.000
but it's hard to tell if he's joking cause we keep setting up this guy,

864
00:48:10.001 --> 00:48:11.980
he's like,
you don't want me one more time.
I would drop you.
Oh,
you know,

865
00:48:11.981 --> 00:48:14.590
he asked us,
hey,
if you guys keep being rude,

866
00:48:14.591 --> 00:48:16.870
I'll drop you off here in the corner.
He's like,
if you keep being real,

867
00:48:16.871 --> 00:48:20.170
drop you right now in this car.
And the guy shut off for the entire ride.

868
00:48:20.171 --> 00:48:24.100
Like he was like so scared.
Like,
man,
we're cool now.
But he was

869
00:48:24.380 --> 00:48:26.580
<v 6>scared while we were in the car as it was definitely scared.
Yeah.</v>

870
00:48:27.910 --> 00:48:30.440
I'm never really going to beat somebody up on the,
I don't find a long time,

871
00:48:30.441 --> 00:48:31.490
but I'm a,

872
00:48:31.491 --> 00:48:34.440
I'm dead serious about as far as like interrupting that someone I finished
there,

873
00:48:34.560 --> 00:48:36.960
<v 7>you know,
it's like a Marshall.
It's like a,
it's like a martial arts respect.</v>

874
00:48:37.460 --> 00:48:39.630
That's right.
Yeah.
People do it accidentally.

875
00:48:40.710 --> 00:48:43.670
There's a lot of folks that don't do it around.
Well,

876
00:48:43.680 --> 00:48:47.300
some guys are not that skilled in the art of,
of talking,
you know,

877
00:48:47.940 --> 00:48:49.980
there's this weird,
uh,
little,
uh,

878
00:48:50.040 --> 00:48:53.260
moments where you want to say something and he can't and you're like,
Eh,

879
00:48:54.230 --> 00:48:54.740
you know,

880
00:48:54.740 --> 00:48:58.450
<v 6>great.
Great.
Okay.
Ready yet?
But his manager,</v>

881
00:48:58.451 --> 00:49:02.940
it was Mike as Mike.
Jeff is Jeff.
It was Jeff.
And,
uh,

882
00:49:02.941 --> 00:49:04.170
I was talking to somebody,
I was like,
well,

883
00:49:04.171 --> 00:49:07.000
Danny or somebody and it comes up in the interrupted,
right.
And it was like,

884
00:49:07.040 --> 00:49:10.510
keep interrupting him,
motherfucker.
Like I'm not seriously mad,
but like,

885
00:49:10.540 --> 00:49:14.680
but seriously let me finish then,
you know,
say your shit.
Right.
But anyway,
he got,

886
00:49:14.681 --> 00:49:17.560
I guess,
you know,
he thought I was serious.
Like he went and told one of the guys,

887
00:49:17.770 --> 00:49:22.120
Ms 20,
just a serious asshole or what I heard about like secondary,
like,
Oh man,

888
00:49:22.121 --> 00:49:25.530
I'm sorry.
I was just fucking around.
So I definitely come across a bit.

889
00:49:25.920 --> 00:49:27.960
<v 7>It's been around,
but you're also letting people know that.</v>

890
00:49:28.420 --> 00:49:30.220
<v 6>Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
for sure.</v>

891
00:49:31.660 --> 00:49:33.840
<v 1>Usually people do it politely and it's like,
hey man,
hold on a second.</v>

892
00:49:33.841 --> 00:49:34.820
I got something to say like,

893
00:49:34.830 --> 00:49:37.470
Hey motherfucker do you should I can interrupt me again.
I'm gonna fuck you up.

894
00:49:37.540 --> 00:49:40.600
<v 7>Yeah,
I know.
Let me finish my story.
There's some people that are so bad at it,</v>

895
00:49:40.601 --> 00:49:43.540
you can't even have a conversation socially awkward.
And should I just go there?

896
00:49:43.541 --> 00:49:45.760
Was this your,
we're never going to really be talking.

897
00:49:46.360 --> 00:49:49.840
I'm just waiting for you to finish.
This is a crazy conversation.

898
00:49:50.790 --> 00:49:53.310
<v 6>I,
they sometimes to my answers,
I'll just fucking go off on a tangent.</v>

899
00:49:53.311 --> 00:49:55.980
I forgot what I'm talking about.
I actually,
I'd be like quite a bit.
Sorry.

900
00:49:56.010 --> 00:49:56.843
Go ahead.

901
00:49:57.870 --> 00:50:00.210
<v 7>Well that's good though,
man.
That's where creativity lies.</v>

902
00:50:00.600 --> 00:50:03.690
Stuck in a predictable pattern.
Yup.
Tangents are where the,

903
00:50:03.770 --> 00:50:06.900
the wild ideas come from,
from holding your balls up to the sun.

904
00:50:06.970 --> 00:50:09.600
See where you're at.
How many loads are left,
where's that coming from?

905
00:50:10.130 --> 00:50:14.010
The universe.
It's just the video.
Brian's TMZ talking.
Oh,

906
00:50:14.370 --> 00:50:16.590
we don't need a play that stop.
Stop,
stop,
stop.
Stop.

907
00:50:16.591 --> 00:50:21.230
That's going to get us kicked off of Youtube.
But no,
no.

908
00:50:21.300 --> 00:50:24.540
Hold on.
We can't,
we keep getting pulled off youtube.

909
00:50:24.570 --> 00:50:26.440
It's happened three times this month.
Right.

910
00:50:26.510 --> 00:50:29.540
So like anytime there's a youtube clip from now on,
I'm not playing them anymore.

911
00:50:29.870 --> 00:50:31.250
I mean,
unless it's something that you're like,

912
00:50:31.251 --> 00:50:34.600
these guys are not going to like put a,
you know,
it's their video.
They come in,

913
00:50:35.240 --> 00:50:38.390
we get pulled from youtube like every week.
It's crazy.
Wow.
Hmm.

914
00:50:38.630 --> 00:50:42.320
Every time we play a youtube clip,
either somebody wants money for,
there's some,

915
00:50:42.620 --> 00:50:46.550
you know,
some of you who don't know what the deal is,
it's not them.

916
00:50:46.580 --> 00:50:51.500
It's people make claims against your video.
Oh,
even TMZ though.
I don't know.

917
00:50:51.620 --> 00:50:54.440
I don't know if they're gonna.
I mean it seems like everybody's doing it.
I mean,

918
00:50:54.441 --> 00:50:57.920
we did it last year was like last week was guy named nature documentary video,

919
00:50:57.980 --> 00:51:01.820
some snake kill and a crocodile.
We got pulled off of Youtube.
Oh Wow.

920
00:51:01.850 --> 00:51:02.421
It's ridiculous.

921
00:51:02.421 --> 00:51:05.030
We're getting told off constantly for these little youtube videos.

922
00:51:05.150 --> 00:51:08.610
So just play that dude's video off of Instagram.
Yeah,

923
00:51:08.750 --> 00:51:12.160
I think it got taken off of Instagram,
but it's a up somewhere else.
Oh really?

924
00:51:12.810 --> 00:51:16.280
Huh?
That's interesting.
Or it is.
We've got took down.
Huh?

925
00:51:16.670 --> 00:51:21.140
So this dude made fun of Mike Epps and Mike Epps and his buddies would beat the

926
00:51:21.141 --> 00:51:24.170
shit out of him.
So that's what's going on today.
Yeah.

927
00:51:24.171 --> 00:51:26.390
Mike Epps beat up a comedian for telling a joke about them.

928
00:51:26.940 --> 00:51:30.200
Can't be telling jokes sometimes.
Here it is right here.

929
00:51:33.940 --> 00:51:38.450
<v 9>Oh look,
good government checkup or near here.
But yeah,
Kevin,</v>

930
00:51:38.490 --> 00:51:40.670
I said you was overrated Nigga.

931
00:51:41.390 --> 00:51:45.690
<v 8>Okay.
His deal flow,
you get on me.
Did you get the sales up Pam?</v>

932
00:51:46.950 --> 00:51:51.740
<v 7>That's it.
And beat the dude up for that.
Really?
Yup.
Wow.
I mean,</v>

933
00:51:51.760 --> 00:51:54.250
I don't know.
I mean maybe confronted him and then the dude was like,

934
00:51:54.251 --> 00:51:57.700
fuck you Mike Epps.
And the due to swinging him there,
he knows.

935
00:51:57.730 --> 00:52:00.820
And then my caps beat him up.
I don't know what really didn't know Mike Epps?

936
00:52:00.850 --> 00:52:05.350
Nope.
I don't know.
Is He,
is he should laugh factory guy or is it,
I don't know.

937
00:52:05.560 --> 00:52:08.890
I have no idea.
I mean,
I've seen his name up there maybe in the past.

938
00:52:09.100 --> 00:52:12.370
Quite honestly.
I don't know the dude.
Yeah,
I dunno.
But um,

939
00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:14.980
I don't know the dude in Atlanta either who got beat up,

940
00:52:15.210 --> 00:52:17.860
but it's just ridiculous.

941
00:52:17.950 --> 00:52:22.360
If you do coke and somebody hits you or somebody makes a joke about you,

942
00:52:22.630 --> 00:52:25.900
like you can't hit him.
Right.
If that's ridiculous.
You're aren't you a comedian?

943
00:52:26.070 --> 00:52:29.500
Yeah.
I mean,
make fun of people all the time.
Yeah.
What if it's funny,

944
00:52:29.501 --> 00:52:31.870
if someone makes fun of you and it's actually funny,

945
00:52:31.871 --> 00:52:34.420
you should be laughing stupid.
You just think that was funny though.

946
00:52:34.480 --> 00:52:35.313
Is that a funny video?

947
00:52:35.520 --> 00:52:38.890
It depends on if he does coke and I don't have a story behind it.

948
00:52:39.310 --> 00:52:44.160
If he does coke,
yeah,
it makes it funnier.
But I'm sure if he doesn't do cocaine,

949
00:52:44.161 --> 00:52:45.610
yeah.
If he's like me,

950
00:52:45.611 --> 00:52:48.070
he's never done coke in his life and he sees a fee like I've been called a

951
00:52:48.071 --> 00:52:51.520
cokehead before,
like so why don't you give him more coked up and drew the UFC?

952
00:52:51.521 --> 00:52:54.910
Like I always hear that you're do you do in the UFC it's just,

953
00:52:54.940 --> 00:52:58.070
it's called have an energy gone based passion.

954
00:52:58.450 --> 00:53:00.730
Passionate human being on the phone.
You're not a robot.

955
00:53:01.210 --> 00:53:04.960
So maybe if he's never done coke and he saw that he would go,
this is bullshit.

956
00:53:04.960 --> 00:53:07.240
I don't even do come.
And they would get mad at the dude.
Yeah.

957
00:53:07.300 --> 00:53:10.930
But if he does do coke,
you've got to let that slide.
Like you said,

958
00:53:10.931 --> 00:53:13.340
like why get mad about something?
Someone's make it funny.
If it is funny,

959
00:53:13.370 --> 00:53:14.203
just laugh about it.

960
00:53:14.320 --> 00:53:17.350
But that's why jokes have about people because they get like,
like me,

961
00:53:17.351 --> 00:53:22.300
like Danny tries making fun of me and I'll just go,
I'll go along with it.

962
00:53:22.301 --> 00:53:23.320
I'll laugh like whatever.
You know.

963
00:53:23.321 --> 00:53:26.100
So I don't get to the brunt end of it too much of like Holdsworth he like takes

964
00:53:26.101 --> 00:53:29.730
offense to it.
You know,
he gets pissed at Danny just eats him apart.
You know?

965
00:53:29.820 --> 00:53:32.760
Like if you,
if you continue to get mad about the joke,
it's funny.

966
00:53:32.761 --> 00:53:34.970
We're going to keep doing it.
You know,
Christine,
it was fun.

967
00:53:36.240 --> 00:53:40.680
We got to get him on the podcast.
Oh yeah.
Without a doubt.
Next time.
Yeah.

968
00:53:40.681 --> 00:53:44.700
Next time you guys come down this way,
Danny bring him by.
Hell.
He's a funny dude.

969
00:53:44.701 --> 00:53:46.380
I liked hanging out with him in Austin.

970
00:53:46.860 --> 00:53:49.500
That was the only time I really hung out with you guys before it really got to

971
00:53:49.501 --> 00:53:53.850
sit down and talk to you guys.
Austin,
besides doing the podcast.
But Danny,

972
00:53:53.851 --> 00:53:57.210
I'd never before just leaving them out fights,
you know?
Yeah.

973
00:53:57.230 --> 00:53:58.310
We'd have to have gone through the whole,

974
00:53:58.320 --> 00:54:02.010
the whole team and fucking awesome crew it let's do it.
Yeah,
for sure.

975
00:54:02.220 --> 00:54:06.320
We started our own a tam radio,
a little podcast deal,
you know,

976
00:54:06.340 --> 00:54:10.920
kind of messing around.
We've
got Bruce buffer that announced that shit.

977
00:54:10.921 --> 00:54:14.460
We should do that too.
He would for sure.
He loves us.

978
00:54:14.490 --> 00:54:17.760
Do you see him announcing Michael Bisbing at his wedding?
Oh,
that's cool.

979
00:54:20.240 --> 00:54:21.630
Yeah,
it was pretty cool.
Yeah,

980
00:54:21.631 --> 00:54:23.610
but we started with like two years ago when I was ultimate fighter.

981
00:54:23.611 --> 00:54:26.820
I break down each episode and it was a pretty cool little thing we started.

982
00:54:26.821 --> 00:54:27.990
We had,
I mean it wasn't anything big,

983
00:54:27.991 --> 00:54:31.980
but we got some normal followers and then Uriah shut it down because he wanted

984
00:54:31.981 --> 00:54:35.100
to start his own Sirius radio show.
He was going to be your eyes block party,

985
00:54:35.101 --> 00:54:38.400
so you may just stop doing it.
And then his radio show never happened.

986
00:54:38.700 --> 00:54:39.660
And so now two years later,

987
00:54:39.661 --> 00:54:43.020
we did our first one again after my fight and it was the most disorganized

988
00:54:43.260 --> 00:54:46.570
Travis like Jv Jv of podcasts,
you know,

989
00:54:46.571 --> 00:54:49.710
so I need to talk to your wife favor.
You can't think like that.
Yeah.

990
00:54:49.770 --> 00:54:52.770
That's the incorrect way of thinking.
I hate to say that,

991
00:54:52.771 --> 00:54:57.030
but what you should do is if a guy does a podcast,
then you do one,

992
00:54:57.031 --> 00:55:00.090
two and then both your podcast feed off of each other and you promote each
other.

993
00:55:00.120 --> 00:55:02.670
Yeah,
exactly.
There's plenty of room for other podcasts,

994
00:55:02.720 --> 00:55:05.540
but there's room for a thousand of them and he just considered team Alpha male

995
00:55:05.541 --> 00:55:09.500
has his team,
so he said we're using Tam.
Radio reasons team not familiar.
Yeah.

996
00:55:09.570 --> 00:55:13.530
For him it's only going to benefit his branch here and you guys are a part of

997
00:55:13.531 --> 00:55:17.100
team Alpha male.
You said,
hey team Alpha Male,
you represented in the cage.

998
00:55:17.400 --> 00:55:19.530
You give a percentage of your,
your purse to that.

999
00:55:19.770 --> 00:55:23.100
I mean that's like being from Yale and not being able to say you're from Yale.

1000
00:55:25.280 --> 00:55:28.440
I mean we're the Yale lawyers.
Did you know you're not allowed to say that.

1001
00:55:28.441 --> 00:55:31.830
What the fuck are you talking about?
Okay,
I'm in Yale and I'm a lawyer,
you know,

1002
00:55:31.831 --> 00:55:33.270
or whatever.
You know what I'm saying?

1003
00:55:33.271 --> 00:55:37.110
I mean it just seems like it would only benefit him to have you guys doing that

1004
00:55:37.111 --> 00:55:39.850
for sure.
And it would put more attention on the team too,
for sure.

1005
00:55:39.900 --> 00:55:40.980
That's why we started it up again.

1006
00:55:40.981 --> 00:55:43.950
We're going to try to try to make it run out and see how it goes.
I don't know.

1007
00:55:43.951 --> 00:55:45.090
We got some funny guys on the team,

1008
00:55:45.091 --> 00:55:48.420
so you're why you should do a serious one if he wants to do a serious one.

1009
00:55:48.421 --> 00:55:51.810
But there's nothing wrong with you guys doing one with fucking Joe Benevidez

1010
00:55:51.840 --> 00:55:54.810
showing his nipple rings be ridiculous.

1011
00:55:56.700 --> 00:56:00.420
Dwayne is like,
he doesn't like the [inaudible] wrestlers.

1012
00:56:00.520 --> 00:56:03.600
So wrestlers were all flexible.
Wrestlers are freaks,
right?

1013
00:56:03.601 --> 00:56:07.020
So he comes to our team and we're a whole team of freaks.
Like,
no,
you know,

1014
00:56:07.200 --> 00:56:11.140
joking around.
Yeah,
exactly.
A little bit too close,

1015
00:56:11.410 --> 00:56:13.890
living too close to each other then he should be.
He's like,
man,

1016
00:56:13.980 --> 00:56:17.800
I stopped this knock,
knock this stuff off.
He's like completely anti like what?

1017
00:56:17.801 --> 00:56:19.740
Whatever we're doing,
you know,
and it makes them uncomfortable.

1018
00:56:19.850 --> 00:56:24.040
Wrestles a kiss you on the mouth just to freak you out.
It's just a free

1019
00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:28.290
<v 1>tried to get gift to kiss Joseph on the way into the cage because,
uh,
um,</v>

1020
00:56:28.490 --> 00:56:31.450
Frig Mirrors,
dad always kisses him before he goes in the cage.
She'll like,

1021
00:56:31.451 --> 00:56:33.420
come on,
give him a mouth.
You got to get through the course,

1022
00:56:33.421 --> 00:56:36.180
a kiss on the mouth when we're going into the cage before we fight.
So it was,

1023
00:56:36.250 --> 00:56:38.970
we got to make out a little bit,
you know,
the gift was like,
you kidding me?

1024
00:56:38.971 --> 00:56:43.180
Like he thought we were serious and you know,
awesome man,

1025
00:56:43.181 --> 00:56:45.730
he's coming up right.
Cause we cope and go for a couple days.

1026
00:56:45.850 --> 00:56:50.800
It's a weird thing about wrestlers is,
uh,
you know,
this,
the attitude and the,
the,

1027
00:56:50.801 --> 00:56:54.110
the intensity that is developed in wrestling rooms is,

1028
00:56:54.520 --> 00:56:55.690
it's not like anything else.

1029
00:56:56.240 --> 00:57:00.580
The amount of hard work that you have to do to be a successful amateur wrestler

1030
00:57:00.820 --> 00:57:02.650
is really,
is incredible.

1031
00:57:02.651 --> 00:57:06.550
So the amount of stress that's involved with being a wrestler is also pretty

1032
00:57:06.551 --> 00:57:07.120
nutty.

1033
00:57:07.120 --> 00:57:10.390
And then the amount of one upsmanship because you're around a bunch of fucking

1034
00:57:10.391 --> 00:57:14.740
savages and every savage wants to be known as the sick fuck.
You know,

1035
00:57:14.741 --> 00:57:15.640
like there's like,
you know,

1036
00:57:15.641 --> 00:57:19.910
I thought it was a sick fuck until I started training with Frank Frank Shit in

1037
00:57:19.911 --> 00:57:22.570
some guy's lunch pail.
You know,
there's always something and it's,

1038
00:57:22.571 --> 00:57:26.500
a lot of it is like pushing each other and feeding off of each cal state

1039
00:57:26.501 --> 00:57:28.810
Fullerton.
I wrestled the locker room antics were ridiculous,

1040
00:57:29.230 --> 00:57:31.300
let alone like I'm telling you,

1041
00:57:31.301 --> 00:57:33.310
it's crazy stuff and everyone's one upping each other.

1042
00:57:33.311 --> 00:57:35.800
Not only in the gym but you're in the locker rooms as well,
you know.

1043
00:57:36.180 --> 00:57:39.460
But there's always one dude.
It takes a 2.24 yeah,
I'm on.

1044
00:57:39.470 --> 00:57:44.260
Would that be at the academy?
At our academy or when I was wrestling?
No,
I dunno.

1045
00:57:44.290 --> 00:57:48.250
Maybe Danny kissed he,
yeah,
he takes it too far,
man.
He does.

1046
00:57:48.510 --> 00:57:52.250
He makes people all of I'm about to cry.
He's good man.

1047
00:57:52.840 --> 00:57:56.180
I've seen him and Justin Buckles Hirsi ruin someone's career.
I think.
Man,

1048
00:57:56.500 --> 00:58:00.520
we had this boxer that came into our gym or take it awesome boxer like awesome.

1049
00:58:00.730 --> 00:58:04.360
And he got so good at him and so fast was doing awesome.
Double legs.

1050
00:58:04.361 --> 00:58:07.240
Jiu Jitsu was catching on quick.
He was like a thug though.

1051
00:58:07.241 --> 00:58:10.920
He grew up on the streets and uh,
you know,
we,
everyone respected him.

1052
00:58:10.930 --> 00:58:14.700
We got in the gym and he's beaten Danny up like Danny's in the UFC and we're

1053
00:58:14.701 --> 00:58:16.870
take as,
you know,
getting the best of him in the gym,
you know,

1054
00:58:17.260 --> 00:58:20.080
and then we go on this trip down to southern California to go train and we hang

1055
00:58:20.081 --> 00:58:23.320
out with or take ticket for like five days straight and we find out who he is

1056
00:58:23.321 --> 00:58:27.820
and you know how like,
I don't know,
he's just mentally weak kind of,
you know.

1057
00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:29.440
And so they started making fun of him,

1058
00:58:29.441 --> 00:58:34.150
breaking them down and they broke them down so hard for five days straight.

1059
00:58:34.151 --> 00:58:36.550
Then when we got back to the gym,
like everything fell apart for him.

1060
00:58:36.760 --> 00:58:38.620
His dog died,
got bit by a rattlesnake.

1061
00:58:38.621 --> 00:58:42.460
He crashed and totaled his car and then like just started losing fights.
And Dan,

1062
00:58:42.461 --> 00:58:45.820
ever since Auntie found out how like mentally weak he wasn't how he could take

1063
00:58:45.821 --> 00:58:49.560
advantage of him.
He started just kicking his butt in the gym mentally,
Blah.

1064
00:58:49.580 --> 00:58:53.290
I broke it down,
mentally broke him down.
I was like,
Danny,
that's messed up.

1065
00:58:53.291 --> 00:58:57.300
Did you use ruin that guy?
He's like,
I know.
I feel bad.
He feels bad.
Oh yeah.

1066
00:58:57.400 --> 00:59:01.090
I mean,
yeah,
this kid was awesome.
Do you ever take it was the man,
he was crazy.

1067
00:59:01.091 --> 00:59:03.460
It was looking good in the gym and then just got broke down.

1068
00:59:03.580 --> 00:59:07.650
How that is really bizarre.
That's a fascinating psychological study.
Yeah.

1069
00:59:07.730 --> 00:59:11.020
I mean I hate the dude had to suffer to get that data,

1070
00:59:11.470 --> 00:59:13.420
but it is quite interesting.

1071
00:59:13.510 --> 00:59:15.430
Like Danny respected him so much when we were practicing.

1072
00:59:15.431 --> 00:59:17.800
He was getting beat up by him,
but then once he found out who he was,

1073
00:59:17.801 --> 00:59:18.850
I mean or take is awesome.

1074
00:59:18.851 --> 00:59:22.220
But once he found out that he was just some other kid that was easily made fun

1075
00:59:22.221 --> 00:59:23.900
of it,
took it,
took it to heart,

1076
00:59:23.930 --> 00:59:28.670
then he just broke him and beat him up in the gym too.
Wow.
That's really weird.

1077
00:59:29.270 --> 00:59:33.470
But it's that kind of shit like people would say that's cruel.
That's horrible.

1078
00:59:33.471 --> 00:59:34.304
That's it.

1079
00:59:34.550 --> 00:59:39.110
But the mental game is just as important as the physical.

1080
00:59:39.400 --> 00:59:41.000
If not someone,

1081
00:59:41.360 --> 00:59:44.640
you're kind of doing mental sparring when you're around a bunch of savages.
Yep.

1082
00:59:44.870 --> 00:59:46.370
You know,
you really are.
I mean,

1083
00:59:46.371 --> 00:59:49.370
I used to remember snide comments that guys would say right before you would

1084
00:59:49.371 --> 00:59:52.880
spar like dude's weird shit to you.
You're like,
what is going on?

1085
00:59:53.050 --> 00:59:54.200
I got a negative weird shit is it?

1086
00:59:54.350 --> 00:59:58.010
And they're planting seeds of doubt in your head.
You know,
man,
that's what,

1087
00:59:58.060 --> 01:00:01.160
you know,
we don't have any of that.
The academy,
the whole,
the team here,
man.

1088
01:00:01.460 --> 01:00:05.840
It's a really a special time.
Like a bad ass up that or tag a fellow.

1089
01:00:05.841 --> 01:00:08.360
Ask him about that.
But I guess recently I saw him there.

1090
01:00:09.290 --> 01:00:10.490
We saved his life though,
man.

1091
01:00:10.491 --> 01:00:13.720
Like we've turned them into like so much of a better person.

1092
01:00:13.740 --> 01:00:15.170
He's got his own jam,
he's getting married,

1093
01:00:15.171 --> 01:00:18.230
he's having a kid like his gym successful.
Like he's on the right path.

1094
01:00:18.231 --> 01:00:21.150
Like things happen the right way for him.
Like he's successful now,
you know,

1095
01:00:21.470 --> 01:00:25.130
and he's a great boxer still to this day.
But I think,
I mean,
he was good,

1096
01:00:25.131 --> 01:00:27.530
but I don't think he could have made it to the elite level to make a living off

1097
01:00:27.531 --> 01:00:30.010
of fighting,
you know?
So you kind of fast track the,
the,

1098
01:00:30.350 --> 01:00:33.440
I think the failure of it,
you know?
That's interesting.
Yeah.

1099
01:00:33.470 --> 01:00:36.700
Or maybe he would've had a rise from the fire,
you know,

1100
01:00:36.770 --> 01:00:39.020
figure it out and get his mental game.

1101
01:00:39.210 --> 01:00:42.890
The same area where it's physical game was,
some guys can do that,
you know,

1102
01:00:43.130 --> 01:00:46.460
you can't,
you make gains in both areas for sure.
Yeah.
But it's harder,

1103
01:00:46.461 --> 01:00:49.490
it seems like to make gains in the mental area.
Yeah,
I think so.

1104
01:00:49.491 --> 01:00:51.080
Physical is obviously very difficult as well,

1105
01:00:51.081 --> 01:00:53.740
but there's something about what a guy loses his confidence.

1106
01:00:53.760 --> 01:00:57.670
Very difficult to get that confidence back.
That's one thing too.
It's called the,

1107
01:00:57.671 --> 01:00:59.720
all these guys here at the Academy at two Ma Famille.

1108
01:01:00.230 --> 01:01:03.790
They're all super mentally tough because you know there are winners and

1109
01:01:03.810 --> 01:01:06.650
wrestling and that just brought on through and now they like sickening work

1110
01:01:06.651 --> 01:01:09.560
ethic with the proper technique down,
have lunch,
just helping each other out is,

1111
01:01:09.860 --> 01:01:12.890
it's a,
it's a mastermind group of martial arts.
It's,
it,
it's,
we're,

1112
01:01:13.070 --> 01:01:16.340
we're involved in the current stage of the martial art evolution right now

1113
01:01:16.460 --> 01:01:17.293
without a doubt.

1114
01:01:17.300 --> 01:01:21.890
And wrestling so tough that it makes fighting for me so much easier.

1115
01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:25.370
Like the,
the,
the struggles I had through wrestling and how hard it was on me,

1116
01:01:25.400 --> 01:01:28.770
hard,
it was on my body and we compete for,
you know,

1117
01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:30.590
six to nine months straight.

1118
01:01:30.591 --> 01:01:33.230
Like you're in the gym grinding for that long straight and then you have this

1119
01:01:33.231 --> 01:01:36.800
break to whereas fighting,
you get to peak yourself,
fight for each event,

1120
01:01:36.830 --> 01:01:37.161
you know,

1121
01:01:37.161 --> 01:01:40.120
but wrestling your restaurant every week and you're grinding and all throughout

1122
01:01:40.121 --> 01:01:44.260
a whole season.
And then you get to the end of the year and stay at top form.

1123
01:01:44.300 --> 01:01:48.860
You know,
so many people get hurt and it affects the way that the NCAAs go down.

1124
01:01:48.890 --> 01:01:49.341
I mean I feel,

1125
01:01:49.341 --> 01:01:53.180
I feel like the smarter coaches don't have the guys go as hard in the beginning

1126
01:01:53.180 --> 01:01:55.430
of the season and then picked him for the end,
which they should do,
you know.

1127
01:01:55.431 --> 01:01:57.560
And uh,
I wish I would've known that more.

1128
01:01:57.561 --> 01:01:59.120
Like I know now that I'm a professional athlete,

1129
01:01:59.121 --> 01:02:02.270
I wish I would've known how to peak myself for wrestling like I do for fighting.

1130
01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:06.460
Do you have a guy who works at you the way Duane Doug's was striking with your,

1131
01:02:06.461 --> 01:02:10.990
your conditioning and monitoring your heart rate and um,
I'm,
I'm,

1132
01:02:11.240 --> 01:02:12.530
I'm slowly getting into that.
I've,

1133
01:02:12.540 --> 01:02:15.170
I've had to go back and forth where I'm training for my strength,

1134
01:02:15.171 --> 01:02:17.290
my strength conditioning.
I found a new guy from,

1135
01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:19.890
for this first camp or the first time I've used him

1136
01:02:20.010 --> 01:02:24.180
<v 3>for this camp for a brow.
And,
uh,
I wanted to put some size on,
you know,</v>

1137
01:02:24.190 --> 01:02:28.560
and so I do a lot of strengthening for when I was far out and,
um,

1138
01:02:28.580 --> 01:02:29.620
cause I knew brown was a big guy.

1139
01:02:29.621 --> 01:02:32.670
I don't want to be able to use my muscle against his.
Um,
but yeah,

1140
01:02:32.671 --> 01:02:34.740
I would still want to get more into that.
I feel,

1141
01:02:35.010 --> 01:02:38.190
I feel training outside the gym is really important to stay in healthy instead

1142
01:02:38.191 --> 01:02:42.240
of just grinding,
beating herself up every day with the martial arts into it.

1143
01:02:42.241 --> 01:02:42.391
You know,

1144
01:02:42.391 --> 01:02:46.230
you see GSP doing all this stuff to keep his body healthy and strong and I feel

1145
01:02:46.231 --> 01:02:48.840
like that will prolong my career if I can do that.
Yeah.

1146
01:02:49.080 --> 01:02:52.370
<v 10>Yeah.
Strength training especially it seems to,
uh,</v>

1147
01:02:52.410 --> 01:02:55.110
protect a lot of guys from a certain amount of injuries.
But then again,

1148
01:02:55.111 --> 01:02:57.180
it causes a certain amount of injuries.
You know,

1149
01:02:57.181 --> 01:03:00.000
there's a lot of guys get injured from strength and conditioning work and then

1150
01:03:00.040 --> 01:03:03.410
they're broken down by the time they get into the gym,
doing it wrong.
Cynthia,

1151
01:03:03.460 --> 01:03:04.440
it's hard.
And doing drills.

1152
01:03:04.510 --> 01:03:04.980
<v 3>See,
I need to,</v>

1153
01:03:04.980 --> 01:03:08.960
I need to find a coach that knows MMA as well because I don't think like a lot

1154
01:03:08.961 --> 01:03:11.530
of strength conditioning coaches don't realize how hard you're working every
day.

1155
01:03:11.810 --> 01:03:12.051
You know,

1156
01:03:12.051 --> 01:03:14.780
I'll go into the gym and I have two hard practices and then I end my day with

1157
01:03:14.781 --> 01:03:16.300
strength conditioning because you know,

1158
01:03:16.350 --> 01:03:18.050
I don't want to hinder my performance in the gym.

1159
01:03:18.051 --> 01:03:21.110
So I wanted to make my strength conditioning last and then he's trying to make

1160
01:03:21.200 --> 01:03:23.390
kill me in that workout too.
So it's like,
man,

1161
01:03:23.391 --> 01:03:25.460
I'm doing three workouts that are ridiculously hard.

1162
01:03:25.461 --> 01:03:27.170
Maybe on this day we should go lighter,
you know,

1163
01:03:27.171 --> 01:03:31.190
are are siloed off my training schedule and know more about the sport and this

1164
01:03:31.191 --> 01:03:33.410
Guy Ish I've been trained with it does a really good job of,

1165
01:03:33.411 --> 01:03:37.400
it almost goes to hard,
but I've kind of had to help him pick me.

1166
01:03:37.640 --> 01:03:37.910
<v 10>Yeah,</v>

1167
01:03:37.910 --> 01:03:40.800
that's good about communication with a good coach to make sure you're pushed him

1168
01:03:40.801 --> 01:03:44.380
just enough to put them back if need be.
That's one thing to hear at the time.

1169
01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:48.870
Familiar I have,
I have a coach's dream.
These guys work hard.

1170
01:03:48.871 --> 01:03:50.840
The only thing I need to do is pull them back at,

1171
01:03:50.850 --> 01:03:52.600
they have no problem going hard and it's,

1172
01:03:52.620 --> 01:03:55.530
there's no babysitting in my job at all.
That's so fantastic.

1173
01:03:55.540 --> 01:03:57.570
That's the biggest complaint you ever hear about trainers.

1174
01:03:57.750 --> 01:04:00.750
Nobody's having to babysit a talented fighter that doesn't like to train.

1175
01:04:01.120 --> 01:04:04.230
You always heard that about,
you know,
I hate to bring up his name rampage.

1176
01:04:04.231 --> 01:04:07.740
You know we started,
that was a great fight when grant page was on.

1177
01:04:07.770 --> 01:04:11.040
I mean people talk a lot of shit about rampers I'd never talked shit about

1178
01:04:11.041 --> 01:04:13.020
rampage cause he's all,
especially the pride days,

1179
01:04:13.300 --> 01:04:16.080
that dude earned his status for life.

1180
01:04:16.230 --> 01:04:20.430
That slam of Ricardo Arona oh he's locked up in that triangle.

1181
01:04:20.970 --> 01:04:25.320
Knocked out Kevin Randleman.
That's right dude.
The rampage from the pride days.

1182
01:04:25.410 --> 01:04:29.130
You know that guy just,
just for that.
Forget about knocking out chocolate.
Dell.

1183
01:04:29.131 --> 01:04:31.410
Forget about any fights just from that.

1184
01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:36.300
But you know rampage like it's a job and he gets paid a lot of money to do it.

1185
01:04:36.301 --> 01:04:40.990
But I don't necessarily know how motivated he is at certain fights.
I'm like,

1186
01:04:41.140 --> 01:04:45.250
and he's hot.
Dolce had a problem with it and other guys about a problem with it,

1187
01:04:46.020 --> 01:04:47.670
but he's so fucking talented.
Yeah.

1188
01:04:47.750 --> 01:04:52.750
You get a guy like him get a brain and the kind of motivation of of you know a

1189
01:04:53.521 --> 01:04:56.700
younger rampage.
That's where a perfect example right here,

1190
01:04:56.701 --> 01:04:58.830
world class athlete with the proper information,

1191
01:04:58.831 --> 01:05:01.230
good training partners and world champion.

1192
01:05:01.231 --> 01:05:04.600
Like this is the thing cutting edge martial art right here.
He moved me.

1193
01:05:04.740 --> 01:05:07.050
There's nothing better than this who being right now as far as the martial arts

1194
01:05:07.051 --> 01:05:11.430
ever.
It's crazy.
It's,
it is,
but don't tell him that.
Right?
It's too late.

1195
01:05:11.431 --> 01:05:14.110
Just did I start getting better?
Getting better for sure.
Yeah.

1196
01:05:14.130 --> 01:05:18.100
We've got prime yet adding new things been awesome for me to live

1197
01:05:18.100 --> 01:05:19.390
<v 1>to these guys.
It's,</v>

1198
01:05:19.391 --> 01:05:24.391
it's crazy is the way you said you spun out of his turning sidekick to every

1199
01:05:24.701 --> 01:05:25.980
time he threw that turning psychic,

1200
01:05:25.990 --> 01:05:30.100
you used his body like on the turn you would like with him the entire way.

1201
01:05:30.340 --> 01:05:35.080
It's like you were just a half a step ahead of his movement all the way around

1202
01:05:35.081 --> 01:05:39.700
the curve.
It's amazing.
I know.
I seriously had so much fun in there.

1203
01:05:39.701 --> 01:05:42.880
Like I mean it's,
it's,
it's a nerve wracking thing you're doing right.

1204
01:05:42.881 --> 01:05:45.950
You're getting into a cage to fight in the pound for pound the best guy?
Well,

1205
01:05:45.951 --> 01:05:48.640
I mean let alone any guy get in the cage with your nervous obviously just to

1206
01:05:48.641 --> 01:05:52.570
perform.
But uh,
I had so much fun that I soaked it all up and just kind of,

1207
01:05:52.870 --> 01:05:55.610
I don't know what the fight was in slow motion for me.
I mean I felt like,

1208
01:05:55.810 --> 01:05:58.870
I felt like the fight was almost an hour long and I could've let it go.

1209
01:05:58.930 --> 01:06:02.050
I feel like I would've gone even though obviously I want that belt around my

1210
01:06:02.051 --> 01:06:03.850
waist and want to be done as soon as possible.

1211
01:06:04.060 --> 01:06:06.430
I felt like I could have gone so much longer just because I was,

1212
01:06:07.450 --> 01:06:10.900
I was in the zone to where like it's professional athletes would pay so much

1213
01:06:10.901 --> 01:06:12.820
money to get obviously,
you know,
it just,
uh,

1214
01:06:13.300 --> 01:06:15.550
it felt amazing in every time he threw spin kick.

1215
01:06:15.551 --> 01:06:18.810
I just saw it and he's got a fast one,
but I would just see what you see.

1216
01:06:19.240 --> 01:06:21.940
There it is right here.
Look,
you can see it right here and see.

1217
01:06:21.941 --> 01:06:24.520
I actually could have taken his back a couple of times when he threw those pink

1218
01:06:24.521 --> 01:06:28.090
kicks.
And I just,
I don't,
for some reason I just kept striking.
It's just,

1219
01:06:28.180 --> 01:06:31.510
I don't know.
I'm almost natural.
Yeah.
That's the article that I was bringing up.

1220
01:06:31.510 --> 01:06:36.040
It's on fight land,
which is a,
a vice,
oh,
those guys are awesome.

1221
01:06:36.610 --> 01:06:40.520
And it is,
the Dude's name is Jack Slack and says how Dell,
how t J.
Dot.

1222
01:06:40.870 --> 01:06:44.980
Killed the king.
I did see this.
It's a great article.
It's really good.

1223
01:06:44.981 --> 01:06:49.810
As far as like the technical aspects of striking broke it down very well in a

1224
01:06:49.811 --> 01:06:51.340
way that it's,
it's,

1225
01:06:51.600 --> 01:06:55.180
it's really difficult to break down and very difficult to do.
So,

1226
01:06:55.210 --> 01:06:57.490
especially if you're a like trying to do it,

1227
01:06:57.940 --> 01:07:02.590
doing commentary because there's a lot of aspects of movement that he's taking

1228
01:07:02.591 --> 01:07:07.120
into account about loading up and about firing one,
two shots at a time,

1229
01:07:07.121 --> 01:07:11.740
being predictable and now other guys are kind of exposed it.
He showed,
um,
uh,
his,

1230
01:07:11.741 --> 01:07:14.770
uh,
his fight with Eddie Wineland.
Yeah.

1231
01:07:14.771 --> 01:07:19.150
Wineland made him move a lot when he frightened with it,
uh,

1232
01:07:19.210 --> 01:07:22.300
at bear air.
And also with Brad Pickett a little bit.

1233
01:07:22.300 --> 01:07:24.520
He showed some of that as well as his brawling.
Yeah.
So this,

1234
01:07:24.521 --> 01:07:26.200
this actually came out before my fight.

1235
01:07:26.770 --> 01:07:28.840
Obviously the new stuff with me up there is new.
Oh,

1236
01:07:28.841 --> 01:07:31.950
this came out after your fight.
There's the images.
Oh,
this tea?
No,

1237
01:07:31.960 --> 01:07:33.720
this is how you killed the king.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Those are,

1238
01:07:33.721 --> 01:07:35.320
there was an article just like this,

1239
01:07:35.321 --> 01:07:38.440
I think it might've been from the same person.
Yes.
It was broke down.

1240
01:07:38.470 --> 01:07:41.050
The broke down exactly how to beat Burrell is before my fight.

1241
01:07:41.380 --> 01:07:45.190
And he was like going over things that how like obviously browse in awesome

1242
01:07:45.191 --> 01:07:47.890
champion,
but these are little holes that you can maybe figure out on him.

1243
01:07:48.100 --> 01:07:51.540
And it came up before my fight and buckles had me watching it in my room week to

1244
01:07:51.650 --> 01:07:53.860
become my fight.
And it was funny because the guy,

1245
01:07:53.861 --> 01:07:57.670
whoever did it was really good because,
uh,
he,
he really,
we're,

1246
01:07:57.680 --> 01:07:59.980
we're already doing all this stuff he was talking about like,

1247
01:08:00.130 --> 01:08:04.480
it went hand in hand with when me and Dwayne roadie practicing and uh,
yeah,
yeah.

1248
01:08:04.481 --> 01:08:07.790
That's another article called killing the king.
Yes.
You know,

1249
01:08:07.840 --> 01:08:12.250
and it's amazing because this guy gave you some advice.
Great Advice.
It was good.

1250
01:08:12.260 --> 01:08:16.010
It was good stuff.
Yeah.
And it does show the killing the king.
Um,
one

1251
01:08:16.010 --> 01:08:20.510
<v 7>is a equally interesting and a equally well informed.
He's excellent.
Very,</v>

1252
01:08:20.511 --> 01:08:21.344
very good writer.

1253
01:08:21.370 --> 01:08:24.560
But that's another example of what I was talking about at this new breed of a,

1254
01:08:24.561 --> 01:08:28.580
of rider and fan that's coming along.
These people that have been involved,

1255
01:08:28.581 --> 01:08:29.860
if don't show him,
lose it.

1256
01:08:34.160 --> 01:08:36.690
He's got a shrink my head a little bit.
Yeah.
I've got to fit through the door.

1257
01:08:37.990 --> 01:08:41.930
If this is the wrong shit to show the show.
I was just scrolling it.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1258
01:08:41.950 --> 01:08:44.700
And you paused on it for a long time looking to see what happened to it.

1259
01:08:44.710 --> 01:08:48.350
It looked like you injured your leg up.
We can show you if you want.
Now those,

1260
01:08:48.380 --> 01:08:49.850
the vice fight land was by far my,

1261
01:08:49.851 --> 01:08:52.040
I think my favorite interviews I did leading up to the fight.

1262
01:08:52.300 --> 01:08:55.070
Like I did a big PR tour and I went and talked with Dan and then they were there

1263
01:08:55.190 --> 01:08:58.070
like the day before my fight or two days before my fight.

1264
01:08:58.310 --> 01:09:00.800
I think those are my favorite interviews to do.
They were,
they were cool dudes.

1265
01:09:00.950 --> 01:09:05.270
Yeah.
The vice guys will,
Shane Smith is a friend of ours and he's a,
you know,

1266
01:09:05.271 --> 01:09:07.970
the founder of the whole thing and it all trickles down from him.

1267
01:09:07.971 --> 01:09:11.450
He's an interesting cat.
Very,
very nice guy too.
It's been on podcast three times,

1268
01:09:11.451 --> 01:09:13.340
right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
And he's a huge,

1269
01:09:13.341 --> 01:09:18.260
huge fan of the UFC and just a guy who was just experienced almost too much,

1270
01:09:18.310 --> 01:09:20.990
you know,
he's almost been around to too many different places.

1271
01:09:20.991 --> 01:09:23.000
It's been too many different parts of the world.
He's like,

1272
01:09:23.210 --> 01:09:25.110
he gets overwhelmed sometimes,
just talk to him.

1273
01:09:25.140 --> 01:09:29.810
He starts talking about the nuclear conflict with Pakistan and India and fucking

1274
01:09:30.900 --> 01:09:34.910
Manhattan's going under water.
And I mean he's just traveling all over the world.

1275
01:09:34.911 --> 01:09:38.690
The fucked up.
So we went Chernobyl,
nuclear wolves with rifles like,

1276
01:09:39.030 --> 01:09:41.590
<v 6>so all this talk is negative for the most part.
A,</v>

1277
01:09:41.730 --> 01:09:44.520
<v 7>well,
not necessarily.
He's a really friendly,
sweet guy,</v>

1278
01:09:44.550 --> 01:09:48.450
but I think maybe he sees a little too much.

1279
01:09:48.560 --> 01:09:51.130
<v 6>I gotcha.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You're going to be a product of your environment.</v>

1280
01:09:51.270 --> 01:09:54.860
<v 7>Just like a fighter.
It's not supposed to spar three times a day every day.</v>

1281
01:09:55.270 --> 01:09:57.480
You're probably not supposed to skip crazy.

1282
01:09:57.520 --> 01:09:59.700
He came into her life and changed it up cause that's what we used to do.

1283
01:10:00.150 --> 01:10:01.820
Did you really change that three times a day?

1284
01:10:01.830 --> 01:10:05.130
We train like weed spot it like three times a week I think sometimes.
Not always,

1285
01:10:05.131 --> 01:10:08.010
but before he got there we did a lot more sparring.
You know,

1286
01:10:08.011 --> 01:10:10.500
which looking back I don't think is the healthiest thing,

1287
01:10:10.501 --> 01:10:14.160
but it definitely got me a whole lot faster,
really quick.
And my gym,
you know,

1288
01:10:14.161 --> 01:10:16.920
cause uh,
I had,
I had two arts,
I wasn't going to make it.

1289
01:10:17.280 --> 01:10:20.670
When you came in there were sparring three times a week,
what did you,

1290
01:10:20.700 --> 01:10:21.990
how did you change that program?

1291
01:10:22.710 --> 01:10:26.940
<v 6>I just asked for the guys to spar hard once a week and still controlled sparring</v>

1292
01:10:26.941 --> 01:10:30.060
though with that and I give them,
I give them four rules,

1293
01:10:30.061 --> 01:10:33.540
I asked them to follow for will show up on time,
get better,
get tired,

1294
01:10:33.580 --> 01:10:36.330
take care of partner.
They do those four things and we're good in,
in,

1295
01:10:36.331 --> 01:10:38.250
in all drills,
especially in sport as well.

1296
01:10:38.580 --> 01:10:41.040
So he's got to make sure that you're taking care of the guy because he's going

1297
01:10:41.041 --> 01:10:43.290
to be there and help you the next day and so on,
which we understand that.

1298
01:10:43.291 --> 01:10:46.260
Sportsmanship,
celebrating on shots when you can.
Yeah,

1299
01:10:46.261 --> 01:10:49.220
and and decently on shots when you at definitely not knocking each other out.

1300
01:10:49.221 --> 01:10:51.840
If he's got,
if you've got them hurt then you know,
relax a little bit,

1301
01:10:51.841 --> 01:10:54.720
let them let them off the Pella,
don't finish them.
If it's a body shot,

1302
01:10:55.110 --> 01:10:55.980
just touch the head a little bit.

1303
01:10:55.980 --> 01:10:58.980
If the headshot and he rocked him and I just didn't touch the body or I will ask

1304
01:10:58.981 --> 01:11:00.900
my guys,
do also as if they hurt the guy.

1305
01:11:01.230 --> 01:11:04.410
Now if I hurt you now I'm on defense now you got to fight out of it and I'm just

1306
01:11:04.411 --> 01:11:06.660
working on a defense and things like that just to make sure he's not keep

1307
01:11:06.661 --> 01:11:08.820
getting punched and punch punch.
That's smart.

1308
01:11:08.940 --> 01:11:11.710
You got a king but work on something.
You got to switch it.
If I,
if I,

1309
01:11:11.711 --> 01:11:12.510
if I rock you,

1310
01:11:12.510 --> 01:11:14.490
I'm on defense now you've got to find out of it because that's what's going to

1311
01:11:14.491 --> 01:11:15.630
happen.
That's a likely scenario.

1312
01:11:15.631 --> 01:11:18.420
So I tried to take a whole bunch of typical scenarios,
fuck,

1313
01:11:18.421 --> 01:11:22.260
relax to go scenarios that happen in the fight and pull them into the gym.

1314
01:11:22.680 --> 01:11:25.670
That's it.
And you just watch it float down.
I'll set a,
Oh,

1315
01:11:25.710 --> 01:11:28.860
set a goal and create a handicap.
Picked out would be the handicapped,

1316
01:11:28.861 --> 01:11:29.640
the handicapped with me.

1317
01:11:29.640 --> 01:11:32.040
I can't throw it back to the goal is for you to fire back out of being,

1318
01:11:32.041 --> 01:11:35.520
you know you being rocked or you were going to kind of right hand stain.

1319
01:11:35.550 --> 01:11:38.820
The goal of the drill is for me too is for you to counter my right hand.

1320
01:11:38.850 --> 01:11:41.610
The goal is not for me to punch you in the face but get it close enough to the

1321
01:11:41.611 --> 01:11:44.880
realistic aspect that he has to properly react to come back with something so

1322
01:11:44.881 --> 01:11:48.840
you're just slowing things down,
which is him.
Case for Jujitsu,
Jujitsu is right,

1323
01:11:48.841 --> 01:11:51.240
which gives you more attempt to rank plush and I get punched in the face.

1324
01:11:51.250 --> 01:11:53.880
You're not freaking out.
Well if I can take away that fear of not freaking out,

1325
01:11:53.881 --> 01:11:54.714
getting punched in the face,

1326
01:11:54.810 --> 01:11:58.350
they could focus on the proper techniques and what needs to happen so you make

1327
01:11:58.351 --> 01:12:02.510
it a part of muscle memory so that if you're in a scenario where things are

1328
01:12:02.511 --> 01:12:04.930
getting wild,
your body is automatically gonna move that way in the project.

1329
01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:08.060
I want to have that,
that muscle memory,
that subconscious protection in action.

1330
01:12:08.220 --> 01:12:11.130
One of the things I found interesting about your system is you've also taken to

1331
01:12:11.131 --> 01:12:15.330
account people that are scared to get hit and you've sort of developed this way

1332
01:12:15.331 --> 01:12:20.070
to slowly build up their confidence.
Yes.
Correct.
And how do you apply that by,

1333
01:12:20.071 --> 01:12:20.370
you know,

1334
01:12:20.370 --> 01:12:24.150
we're going to start today and we're going to go 50% this nice and light or at a

1335
01:12:24.151 --> 01:12:26.820
pace where you're not going to be scared.
You have to,

1336
01:12:26.830 --> 01:12:28.400
if you hate from get scared,
like hey,

1337
01:12:28.401 --> 01:12:30.540
he can you slow it down a little bit or I need to make sure I'm there to tell

1338
01:12:30.541 --> 01:12:33.320
him to slow it down because I don't see that proper actions out of this guy.

1339
01:12:33.321 --> 01:12:36.690
He's for still freaking out.
So you need to slow down.
I'm going to feed 2% okay,

1340
01:12:36.691 --> 01:12:39.590
if that's your 50% motherfucker,
then go 10% you know,
like I slept in my bed,

1341
01:12:39.790 --> 01:12:41.520
I'm watching the guy.
Uh,
things like that.

1342
01:12:41.521 --> 01:12:43.620
But then also just a setting the goals too.
Like my,

1343
01:12:43.790 --> 01:12:46.200
the guy who was the back against the wall and this guy just told him straight

1344
01:12:46.201 --> 01:12:48.660
shots that again,
the goal at the drill is for him to defend the straight shots.

1345
01:12:48.840 --> 01:12:50.820
Not for me to punch in the face,
but even I know it's coming.

1346
01:12:50.821 --> 01:12:54.360
You can relax and don't talk as fast as me and the punches.

1347
01:12:54.420 --> 01:12:58.350
Ernesto hoost was talking recently.
Perfect.
Mr. Proof of that dude,

1348
01:12:58.351 --> 01:13:01.040
one of the greatest kickboxers of all times.
Beautiful to watch him.

1349
01:13:01.080 --> 01:13:05.520
And he was talking recently about training and about how some gyms,

1350
01:13:05.521 --> 01:13:07.950
they knock each other out in the gym and he's like,
that's ridiculous.

1351
01:13:07.951 --> 01:13:09.870
That's just never happened.
He's like,
you,

1352
01:13:09.871 --> 01:13:12.960
you don't need to do that to save it for the fight.
And you know,

1353
01:13:12.961 --> 01:13:15.150
he's one of the greatest kickboxers ever,
ever.
But he's like,

1354
01:13:15.151 --> 01:13:19.470
you're wasting your yourself in the gym because there's certain gyms,
you know,

1355
01:13:19.471 --> 01:13:22.890
like a kickboxing.
He was like Mike's gym.
Cause I heard about this mutation,

1356
01:13:23.160 --> 01:13:27.150
just wars.
They go to war,
Melvin Manhoef and Badr Hari throwing fucking rocks.

1357
01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:32.740
<v 3>I uh,
learned so much from this place,
a kingdom and may how feel as gym.</v>

1358
01:13:33.180 --> 01:13:34.730
But man,
I went down there and I've,

1359
01:13:34.790 --> 01:13:37.630
I think I've never been scared to get into there for the second time.

1360
01:13:37.631 --> 01:13:41.530
You go in there,
it's full out war,
like really going as hard as you possibly can.

1361
01:13:41.531 --> 01:13:45.370
Like seeing people get dropped and stuff and you have to be on your a game and

1362
01:13:45.400 --> 01:13:46.390
the next one we're in there for sparring.

1363
01:13:46.391 --> 01:13:47.980
It was like I was nervous getting in there,
you know,

1364
01:13:47.981 --> 01:13:49.180
cause I was going with bigger dudes too.

1365
01:13:49.190 --> 01:13:52.900
I mean they let you split with whoever and there was a guy throwing knees at my

1366
01:13:52.901 --> 01:13:53.960
head and uh,

1367
01:13:54.070 --> 01:13:57.490
it was insanity and I actually got to spar with Hockfield Cordelia and he

1368
01:13:57.491 --> 01:13:59.800
dropped me like twice as his stomach with his push kicked man.

1369
01:14:00.130 --> 01:14:02.820
He's got like seriously the best push kick I've ever felt is good.

1370
01:14:02.830 --> 01:14:06.970
He's a great boy.
Chaga dropped me like come on my stomach like,
oh you know,

1371
01:14:07.160 --> 01:14:12.100
this is like my first fight in the UFC and you just told me up to the sport

1372
01:14:12.100 --> 01:14:15.330
<v 7>needs more masters of the martial arts like that.
Like have hooker Dora.</v>

1373
01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.280
Absolutely master in the art.
That's awesome.

1374
01:14:18.310 --> 01:14:22.010
I just don't know if I agree with that.
Shoot the box way of training.
Crazy.

1375
01:14:22.030 --> 01:14:25.630
No I don't,
I don't like that either.
Seems like it's not the best way anymore.

1376
01:14:25.810 --> 01:14:27.840
It works with some guys.
You know,

1377
01:14:27.850 --> 01:14:30.910
some guys it works for but I think that there's,
there's,

1378
01:14:31.510 --> 01:14:33.820
there's certainly something to be said for his results.

1379
01:14:33.880 --> 01:14:38.110
I mean you look at the guys who trained Anderson Silva,
fucking Vandelay Silva,

1380
01:14:38.140 --> 01:14:39.770
Shogun Ninja.

1381
01:14:40.100 --> 01:14:42.200
<v 3>I mean just mad men.</v>

1382
01:14:42.350 --> 01:14:45.230
And I went in there and kind of fit in perfectly because I was just going super

1383
01:14:45.231 --> 01:14:46.910
aggressive as well and went really hard,

1384
01:14:46.911 --> 01:14:50.180
which I'm glad I learned it not do so when you watch anymore.
But uh,

1385
01:14:50.360 --> 01:14:53.570
it was funny cause Bob in there and he's,
instead of using hand wraps,

1386
01:14:53.750 --> 01:14:57.290
he's just got his hands duct taped.
You know,
just hard as a rock duck tape.

1387
01:14:58.250 --> 01:15:02.140
He's got his shin guards,
duck tape dawn.
He's just scary dude.
And he's like,
what?

1388
01:15:02.160 --> 01:15:04.280
After I got done with practice and I'll feel is talking to everyone,

1389
01:15:04.490 --> 01:15:07.040
he like had to point out how much he loved my sparring cause I'll hardly went

1390
01:15:07.041 --> 01:15:08.960
when it should have been the opposite.
It should be like,
you know,

1391
01:15:08.961 --> 01:15:12.560
you need to control it a little bit and you kind of beat up on this guy and you

1392
01:15:12.561 --> 01:15:15.650
know.
But instead he was like,
I love it.
You need to come back here more.
You know?

1393
01:15:15.790 --> 01:15:19.880
Wow.
It's an animal.
Oh yeah,
he's an animal is an animal.

1394
01:15:20.130 --> 01:15:23.140
Guys is tell him I listened.
I kit.
Let's just see the brain cells for the,

1395
01:15:23.180 --> 01:15:25.590
for the fight itself and the training.
It's foreign.

1396
01:15:25.950 --> 01:15:28.200
<v 7>Yeah.
I mean it's interesting to different approaches.</v>

1397
01:15:28.230 --> 01:15:32.010
Some guys just fucking stump the pedal to the metal and when the wheels fly off

1398
01:15:32.011 --> 01:15:35.910
the car.
All right.
I guess we're stopping here,
but he's not,

1399
01:15:36.020 --> 01:15:39.540
I mean this Vandelay thing is crazy that's going on right now.
Oh yeah.

1400
01:15:39.541 --> 01:15:41.700
I heard it for a random drug test and he bounced.

1401
01:15:41.820 --> 01:15:44.010
They tried to get him with a random drug test and he said,

1402
01:15:44.011 --> 01:15:47.280
I'm fucking out of here.
And ran out of his house.
I heard us,

1403
01:15:47.400 --> 01:15:51.610
I don't know Jim,
Jim,
but he was like,

1404
01:15:51.810 --> 01:15:54.820
where's your paperwork?
Who are you?
I've got to go.
I think chills.

1405
01:15:54.840 --> 01:15:58.050
The one that said he ran.
Right.
Who knows if he actually did run?
Most likely.

1406
01:15:58.051 --> 01:16:02.850
So here's the drought.
Who's chasing Vandelay chase and van was like,
no,
you do.

1407
01:16:02.851 --> 01:16:07.810
If you caught him,
shit,
tell him good job.
Hey,
you run quick.

1408
01:16:08.130 --> 01:16:12.210
Don't kill me.
Fucking Nevada state athletic commission.

1409
01:16:13.180 --> 01:16:18.150
His collector guy can run.
Probably that is the last guy you want to chase.
Oh,

1410
01:16:18.151 --> 01:16:21.930
that's hilarious.
And so he said he had some,
he made a video.

1411
01:16:22.020 --> 01:16:23.940
So he's got some excuse for why he didn't,

1412
01:16:25.260 --> 01:16:27.300
but he's got to work it out with the Nevada state.
That's about the commission.

1413
01:16:27.301 --> 01:16:30.900
Whatever they took testosterone offer,
they'd no one could be on testing anymore.

1414
01:16:30.930 --> 01:16:34.260
No one is,
well,
he was never on it.
He didn't have an exemption,

1415
01:16:34.261 --> 01:16:36.930
so he wasn't on and officially don't you look at me like that Dwayne,

1416
01:16:37.860 --> 01:16:41.220
just stretching,
man.
I got us thinking about back.
Okay,
what's that?

1417
01:16:41.910 --> 01:16:46.500
I think he's probably had a vitamin or two in his day.
He's healthy.

1418
01:16:46.650 --> 01:16:48.200
Yeah.
I think he's,
he works out,

1419
01:16:48.270 --> 01:16:52.440
he must work in supplements were involved and then some of his primary

1420
01:16:52.441 --> 01:16:55.560
development,
especially early in the day you look at the pride fights,

1421
01:16:55.710 --> 01:17:00.450
he was a motherfucker.
Dude.
Pride was so special.
Oh Man.
I want to crazy.

1422
01:17:00.850 --> 01:17:02.960
I got to watch some more of those fights.
I get to watch for a price.

1423
01:17:03.040 --> 01:17:05.760
We have these gloves.
And I wanted to ask you about these,

1424
01:17:05.761 --> 01:17:07.820
cause I asked Brendan Schaub about on the other day,
um,

1425
01:17:08.400 --> 01:17:10.040
do you think there's a way

1426
01:17:10.220 --> 01:17:15.220
<v 10>to make a glove that has less finger pokes and and is it a pride glove because</v>

1427
01:17:15.321 --> 01:17:17.960
the pride glove has a little bit of a curve curve to the hand.

1428
01:17:18.020 --> 01:17:20.330
I think that's the answer because a booster,

1429
01:17:20.360 --> 01:17:22.970
they made a pair of gloves that we can open her hand all the way.

1430
01:17:23.330 --> 01:17:24.061
I thought that was perfect.

1431
01:17:24.061 --> 01:17:25.910
Sea Kelp and of the way that you're going to be less finger poked,

1432
01:17:25.911 --> 01:17:28.430
it's all like this.
Yeah.
It just like a little cup,
like a little mitten.

1433
01:17:28.740 --> 01:17:32.090
I mean at your fingers still exposed but they just can't open the handle the way

1434
01:17:32.091 --> 01:17:35.090
it was sewn on the science.
He just couldn't do it.
Like those little hinge there.

1435
01:17:35.150 --> 01:17:37.340
I think that would actually be,
I don't know would help Annie can still,

1436
01:17:37.341 --> 01:17:40.340
for the most part you kind of grapple with that monkey gripped anyways.

1437
01:17:40.350 --> 01:17:44.180
You don't risk control step when the guy like VRE doom for Dumas is a lot of

1438
01:17:44.181 --> 01:17:47.180
risk controls triangle and use your thumb and thought would be fine.

1439
01:17:47.180 --> 01:17:48.030
You can use his thumb.
Exactly.

1440
01:17:48.031 --> 01:17:50.250
Maybe if your hands are curling and you're going to grab the risks of some while

1441
01:17:50.251 --> 01:17:52.520
your hands still going to be curled,
you know he can be to grab it like that.

1442
01:17:52.550 --> 01:17:57.050
Yeah.
I guess we never do you use,
you really use individual finger manipulation.

1443
01:17:57.490 --> 01:18:01.520
You never do this.
He never interlock your fingers on the Thai clinch.

1444
01:18:01.610 --> 01:18:04.230
Yeah and that that's true,
right?
That is true.

1445
01:18:04.330 --> 01:18:06.350
Vandelay did used to clinches first together,

1446
01:18:07.220 --> 01:18:10.500
but do you think the correct technique tie wise?
It's like this anyway,

1447
01:18:11.690 --> 01:18:13.580
but if you want to do this you can but I just,
I dunno.

1448
01:18:13.750 --> 01:18:14.920
I just think it's just stronger growth.
Yeah.

1449
01:18:14.921 --> 01:18:16.340
I think it's a stronger grip as well.

1450
01:18:16.610 --> 01:18:20.000
Like I've seen guys get away with weird grips and take downs,

1451
01:18:20.030 --> 01:18:22.850
but you know when you can,
when you lock cries waste,

1452
01:18:23.150 --> 01:18:24.920
the Gable grip just feels so right.

1453
01:18:25.970 --> 01:18:28.480
It feels like snuggle.

1454
01:18:28.490 --> 01:18:32.510
You sucker just love this little guy and you've got so much power in that

1455
01:18:32.511 --> 01:18:37.130
position.
It's such a good position.
But um,
yeah,

1456
01:18:37.131 --> 01:18:39.560
if they could have something where the fingertips are covered,

1457
01:18:39.561 --> 01:18:41.690
we can't poke the eye.
Well they weren't,
they weren't covered.

1458
01:18:41.691 --> 01:18:44.570
And then the gloves I seen,
it may be you have to cover,
I'm not sure,

1459
01:18:44.600 --> 01:18:46.010
but that they were just pretty much just like this,

1460
01:18:46.011 --> 01:18:48.550
but just had a hinge on the science.
We can open it all the way you just place,

1461
01:18:48.640 --> 01:18:52.100
you could have it so that the fingertips are somewhere in another covered with

1462
01:18:52.101 --> 01:18:56.700
like a softer piece of leather.
Some neoprene.
Yeah,

1463
01:18:56.810 --> 01:18:57.890
something along those lines.

1464
01:18:57.891 --> 01:19:00.810
Just something that be custom fit gloves to be perfect.

1465
01:19:00.811 --> 01:19:03.230
Then I guess each of fighter rough,
the customer pick list,
would that be,

1466
01:19:03.231 --> 01:19:06.380
you got a mouthpiece mouthpiece,
why can't you have custom fee and a fight?

1467
01:19:06.590 --> 01:19:10.490
They'd have to be measured to the day of the fight for the A and e big cuts and

1468
01:19:10.491 --> 01:19:10.961
such like that.

1469
01:19:10.961 --> 01:19:14.270
We get some fingers are different lengths but just tight rubber to seems to me

1470
01:19:14.271 --> 01:19:18.140
like this.
At least we should be exploring other options.
How many,

1471
01:19:18.190 --> 01:19:22.550
I think there's right the,
I think if they can open the hand curve.
Yeah,
boom.

1472
01:19:22.660 --> 01:19:24.800
Yeah,
that would be,
I think that would be it.
Yeah,
I think so too.

1473
01:19:24.801 --> 01:19:28.610
Like the John Jones,
John is hard,
right?

1474
01:19:28.800 --> 01:19:32.570
Sean Jones does that a lot and he's always crew sophomoric.
But yeah,
look,

1475
01:19:32.571 --> 01:19:36.950
he's got the greatest physical advantage I've ever seen in the octagon and he's

1476
01:19:36.951 --> 01:19:41.120
the smartest ever using it.
I mean he's the best to keep in guys at the end,

1477
01:19:41.121 --> 01:19:44.750
but damn was a lot of Ipos and definitely with him for sure.

1478
01:19:44.820 --> 01:19:48.110
And he could get away with the same strategy and same style at the fingertips,

1479
01:19:48.111 --> 01:19:51.320
recovered it and it would be fine if there was a way to touch foreheads,

1480
01:19:51.530 --> 01:19:53.480
he'd still be able to throw those elbows and punches.

1481
01:19:53.520 --> 01:19:54.830
I mean he's not trying to do,

1482
01:19:54.850 --> 01:19:58.370
to me grabbing the wrist and hands wouldn't it from a distance?

1483
01:19:58.430 --> 01:20:02.120
Well it also would make escripts you would actually have more,
more friction,

1484
01:20:02.420 --> 01:20:05.720
you know,
if you had a escript and break that yeah,
you'd have if you had like a,

1485
01:20:05.750 --> 01:20:08.250
like some sort of a Suede,
something like that.
Like something

1486
01:20:08.250 --> 01:20:11.360
<v 0>was a little bit of traction to it.
Once you lock that up you'd have to leave.</v>

1487
01:20:12.110 --> 01:20:14.040
Yeah.
As long as I mean you fingers.

1488
01:20:14.220 --> 01:20:17.490
The only difference would be you wouldn't get as much hand cause you would have

1489
01:20:17.491 --> 01:20:21.090
like a little meat in between so wouldn't be able to fully long rant anyway.

1490
01:20:21.470 --> 01:20:24.120
It's always a bit tricky to grab with the wraps around.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

1491
01:20:24.121 --> 01:20:28.360
Anything that makes your hands fatter.
But have you tried those Beltour gloves?

1492
01:20:28.410 --> 01:20:33.390
No.
No tour has a,
an Everlast that's like curve.
Well there you go.
Yeah.

1493
01:20:33.510 --> 01:20:37.260
And it also has more padding over the metacarpal offer,

1494
01:20:37.261 --> 01:20:40.260
more support on impacts and to think that it will protect,

1495
01:20:40.380 --> 01:20:41.170
you should start keeping

1496
01:20:41.170 --> 01:20:42.620
<v 1>stats on a broken hands.</v>

1497
01:20:42.621 --> 01:20:47.621
And I pokes and see who has more obviously in either a organization

1498
01:20:48.230 --> 01:20:50.710
<v 0>Tor had like the first day they use it,</v>

1499
01:20:50.711 --> 01:20:53.530
they had an eye poke so the IPOs are still going to be there,

1500
01:20:53.590 --> 01:20:55.120
but nobody's broken their hand.

1501
01:20:55.510 --> 01:20:58.120
So they had like a gang of people break their hands before.

1502
01:20:58.150 --> 01:20:59.080
But with these new gloves,

1503
01:20:59.081 --> 01:21:01.330
I don't believe that they've had a hand or had them for,

1504
01:21:01.510 --> 01:21:03.630
they've had them for a while.
Wow.
Like A,

1505
01:21:04.420 --> 01:21:08.530
I think there was like 11 fights and out of those 11 fights,

1506
01:21:08.590 --> 01:21:11.500
no one had the handbrake.
And that was like the first time they'd ever had that.

1507
01:21:12.100 --> 01:21:15.970
I should,
I should pay attention to that and give a better,
uh,

1508
01:21:16.060 --> 01:21:20.530
accurate assessment of it.
But I love that they're doing something.
Yeah,

1509
01:21:20.531 --> 01:21:24.030
absolutely.
I mean these are moneymakers keep them safe.
Yeah.

1510
01:21:24.350 --> 01:21:29.350
Also it should be,
there should be a lot of consideration taken into this stuff.

1511
01:21:29.351 --> 01:21:32.740
And when you see this a,
the same thing happened over,
I mean,
what's it,

1512
01:21:33.010 --> 01:21:34.360
what's the definition of insanity?

1513
01:21:34.360 --> 01:21:36.670
Doing the same thing over and over again expecting different results.

1514
01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.460
When you have these people that are getting poked in the eyes over and over and

1515
01:21:39.461 --> 01:21:42.760
over again.
It's like this isn't the only way we can do this.
Guys.
There's,

1516
01:21:42.790 --> 01:21:46.000
there's other fucking ways.
All right,
if you guys goggles,

1517
01:21:46.180 --> 01:21:47.680
how about you see guys train?

1518
01:21:48.010 --> 01:21:51.850
God's trying to get armbars when they have boxing gloves on giant fucking 16

1519
01:21:51.851 --> 01:21:53.890
ounce gloves and they'll,
they'll take armbars,

1520
01:21:54.210 --> 01:21:57.020
they'll try to do rear naked chokes to do like a halfass room.
Nigga choke.

1521
01:21:57.400 --> 01:21:59.830
You can grapple grapple and still not,

1522
01:22:00.190 --> 01:22:03.560
<v 1>I'll be scrolling your idea and I'll throw like a jab or something and he'll</v>

1523
01:22:03.561 --> 01:22:06.650
catch my glove between it and you know,
the catch and stop me then hit me.

1524
01:22:07.290 --> 01:22:09.400
The first guy I ever saw do it,
uh,

1525
01:22:09.440 --> 01:22:13.160
I think was Josh Thompson is a clever veterans.

1526
01:22:13.470 --> 01:22:18.200
He choked someone and grab the inside of his own glove and you're allowed to do

1527
01:22:18.201 --> 01:22:21.370
that.
You're allowed to grab your own lot of the holes on your own.
Yeah.

1528
01:22:21.410 --> 01:22:23.030
You can't hold another dude's glove,

1529
01:22:23.031 --> 01:22:25.970
but you could choke the fuck out of a guy with your glove.

1530
01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.490
And it's like hook underneath it.
They might've changed that.

1531
01:22:28.491 --> 01:22:29.510
I don't believe they have though.

1532
01:22:29.550 --> 01:22:31.400
Think much harder to beat it and bite your hand off.

1533
01:22:31.670 --> 01:22:33.380
Like say I did the Gable grip people.
If I'm a hand off,

1534
01:22:33.381 --> 01:22:34.760
like he's using that hidden all the way back.

1535
01:22:35.140 --> 01:22:37.550
If you were talked to deepen that wrap underneath,

1536
01:22:37.900 --> 01:22:40.870
you're holding on the old leather cord,
you know?
Uh,

1537
01:22:40.910 --> 01:22:42.530
after I washed my fight in the first round,

1538
01:22:42.531 --> 01:22:45.120
I could have went for the Japanese necktie.
Oh,
you think so?

1539
01:22:45.140 --> 01:22:46.040
I could have went for it.
He,

1540
01:22:46.240 --> 01:22:49.460
I went on top of some ground and pound it was rushing it and he came into my

1541
01:22:49.461 --> 01:22:53.450
half guard.
I could've,
I could've possibly went for the Japanese necktie.
Yeah.

1542
01:22:53.451 --> 01:22:58.120
Maybe that would have been crazy.
Especially because the awning,
the awning,
uh,

1543
01:22:58.220 --> 01:22:59.480
the video.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well,

1544
01:22:59.481 --> 01:23:02.510
and then also they offered me an extra bonus for her to finish my next fight

1545
01:23:02.780 --> 01:23:06.160
with the Japanese necktie.
I told the operator operates,
it's awesome.

1546
01:23:06.190 --> 01:23:08.040
<v 3>I told Albert,
he's like,
all right man,
I'm getting busy.</v>

1547
01:23:08.060 --> 01:23:11.590
I'm getting Mrs Gawky with that.
You know,
obviously my fight change,
but I was,

1548
01:23:11.620 --> 01:23:14.950
I could have gone for even hilarious.
I love the dark.
Anyways,

1549
01:23:15.400 --> 01:23:17.480
I saw that there as well.
I could have gone for it,
but yeah,

1550
01:23:17.600 --> 01:23:19.560
<v 0>for folks who have no idea what we're talking about,</v>

1551
01:23:19.561 --> 01:23:21.320
there's a technique called the dark.

1552
01:23:21.330 --> 01:23:25.390
It's a very common choke that when a guy has an under hook on you,
his,

1553
01:23:25.410 --> 01:23:29.970
his arm is essentially wrapped around your body and you can get your arm

1554
01:23:30.060 --> 01:23:31.770
underneath his arm.
It goes,

1555
01:23:31.890 --> 01:23:35.760
your forearm goes underneath his armpit and it's slides up past his neck.

1556
01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:39.660
Then what you do is you put your other arm over the back of his head and he

1557
01:23:39.670 --> 01:23:40.800
class,
behold your bicep.

1558
01:23:41.010 --> 01:23:45.300
It's very difficult to put all those things together because most guys recognize

1559
01:23:45.301 --> 01:23:47.670
when the arm is underneath the armpit that you're in danger.

1560
01:23:47.700 --> 01:23:50.460
So someone developed a technique called the Japanese necktie.

1561
01:23:50.730 --> 01:23:54.780
And what it allows you to do is it allows you to clasp your hands together over

1562
01:23:54.781 --> 01:23:57.420
the back of the head and never cinch it up on your bicep.

1563
01:23:57.600 --> 01:24:02.070
But still it actually becomes an even more effective technique because you trap

1564
01:24:02.071 --> 01:24:07.071
the head in the center of your chest and it's a nasty neck crank and TJ and

1565
01:24:07.620 --> 01:24:08.730
Danny Castillo and I,

1566
01:24:08.910 --> 01:24:12.300
we're all doing this and an audit video and we're going over the technique.

1567
01:24:12.720 --> 01:24:16.980
And so that's when Ana came up with this idea of having you have a benefit.

1568
01:24:17.400 --> 01:24:19.530
<v 3>Yeah,
cause I mean I,
I've already fallen in love with it.</v>

1569
01:24:19.531 --> 01:24:22.410
I've done it in the gym all the time.
Not to,
I have OT cause I'd go for that.

1570
01:24:22.411 --> 01:24:23.221
Darson and like you said,

1571
01:24:23.221 --> 01:24:25.950
people try to defend it and then you can still hold on and get that choke.

1572
01:24:26.170 --> 01:24:30.030
So it'll also give you a blood choke and hurts really bad hearts bad.

1573
01:24:30.040 --> 01:24:33.780
I immediately when I get locked up in that neck,
so stiff.

1574
01:24:33.781 --> 01:24:37.110
After you guys rolled that,
he tried to make the man and now he's like,
all right,

1575
01:24:37.111 --> 01:24:37.891
go hard on this.

1576
01:24:37.891 --> 01:24:40.530
You know you've got them in like the Omoplata and then you turned him over and

1577
01:24:40.531 --> 01:24:43.590
got him like can a little net crank music where I need to fight out of it.

1578
01:24:43.591 --> 01:24:47.460
He's like for like a good like week,
he's like to my neck hurt so bad.

1579
01:24:48.360 --> 01:24:50.580
He finishes guy with in Brazil.
He got the head and arm.

1580
01:24:50.581 --> 01:24:53.430
Are you an Anaconda or doors?
I remember huck.

1581
01:24:53.520 --> 01:24:55.590
He just finished somebody in Brazil.
Go ahead.
Her book?
Yeah,

1582
01:24:55.670 --> 01:24:59.900
<v 0>like he's just so not interested in,
in being on the bottom.
He's not interested.</v>

1583
01:24:59.901 --> 01:25:03.740
He's a dominant restaurant.
He's dude's these smashers his top games so hard.

1584
01:25:03.850 --> 01:25:04.401
But I was just,

1585
01:25:04.401 --> 01:25:08.150
I just wanted him to see it and I was teaching it to a Aubrey's friend Whitney.

1586
01:25:08.390 --> 01:25:10.630
I was showing her the technique.
She's really into Jujitsu.

1587
01:25:10.640 --> 01:25:13.460
So I was showing her some rubber guard stuff and I just wanted to show it on a

1588
01:25:13.461 --> 01:25:17.090
strong guy like Danny,
like watch this shit works.
I tried to get out,

1589
01:25:18.110 --> 01:25:22.760
lock a guy up in mission control.
I'm a middle aged comedian,
you know,

1590
01:25:22.850 --> 01:25:26.130
<v 3>fuck off.
Fuck Shit.
This comedian,</v>

1591
01:25:27.790 --> 01:25:31.610
the reality is I'm a middle aged comedian.
Fucking Ninja.

1592
01:25:32.370 --> 01:25:36.590
Nice boy.
You are for all like pretty stout,
but your legs are so flexible.
Yeah.

1593
01:25:36.591 --> 01:25:38.890
Well I've stretched my whole life and we're march learn.

1594
01:25:38.930 --> 01:25:41.780
I make sure that I stretch.
I can't do that rubber.
I can't do the rubber.

1595
01:25:41.781 --> 01:25:43.510
I mean I could try to,
but to the extent

1596
01:25:43.790 --> 01:25:46.970
<v 0>rubber guard.
Yeah.
Well I could do full lotus.
I can dump a load of sucking,</v>

1597
01:25:47.420 --> 01:25:51.560
flatten my legs out like that lie on my stomach,
but I make it.
I make it work.

1598
01:25:51.561 --> 01:25:55.940
You know,
I,
when I lift,
especially if I lift legs,
I stretch out for 40 minutes.

1599
01:25:56.180 --> 01:26:01.160
Wow.
40 home afterwards.
After I train,
I give,
especially with legs,
you don't,

1600
01:26:01.161 --> 01:26:02.990
you can't fuck around with that because that was my,

1601
01:26:03.290 --> 01:26:07.400
and butter was my kicking ability.
Like throw all throughout taekwondo of course.

1602
01:26:07.401 --> 01:26:08.600
And then when I started kickboxing,

1603
01:26:08.601 --> 01:26:11.630
this thing has separated me from a lot of other guys was the dexterity.

1604
01:26:11.900 --> 01:26:16.280
Have you seen this fucking guy who's fighting and glory now that is,
um,

1605
01:26:16.670 --> 01:26:21.350
uh,
Raymond Daniels.
Have you seen this?
Holy Shit.

1606
01:26:21.560 --> 01:26:25.460
He hit a dude with a sidekick jumping,

1607
01:26:25.461 --> 01:26:29.150
turning sidekick in the face and knocked the guy out and glory.

1608
01:26:29.151 --> 01:26:33.800
One of the wildest combinations in a,
in a kickboxing match I've ever seen.

1609
01:26:33.800 --> 01:26:35.060
He dropped the dude with the right hand.

1610
01:26:35.180 --> 01:26:38.640
The guy went down and he hit this jumping side,

1611
01:26:38.760 --> 01:26:41.850
spinning sidekick in the air,
running the dude's face.
Hold,
tuck.

1612
01:26:41.910 --> 01:26:45.470
The whole pull down on a to that up.
It was Raymond Daniels Glory.

1613
01:26:45.471 --> 01:26:47.960
Kao It's like one of the greatest kick Kaos.
Evan,

1614
01:26:47.980 --> 01:26:51.440
when did you start training in martial arts?
When I was 14,
I took karate.
Well,

1615
01:26:51.441 --> 01:26:54.980
I took Kung Fu when I was really young,
but I got serious when I was 14.

1616
01:26:54.981 --> 01:26:57.110
I took karate and then,
um,

1617
01:26:57.520 --> 01:27:02.360
I went to this taekwondo school from 15 on and that was a Jay Kim Taekwondo

1618
01:27:02.360 --> 01:27:06.570
Institute in Boston.
From then on.
It was obsessed from 15 to like 20,
20.

1619
01:27:06.620 --> 01:27:10.730
I want to see him.
Uh,
we'll kick someone I was holding that had the path.

1620
01:27:10.731 --> 01:27:14.120
That's right.
I think,
guess more videos going.
Yeah.
Well I will do some with you,

1621
01:27:14.121 --> 01:27:18.470
man.
Let's do it.
Yeah,
I would love to.
If there's a,
here it is.
Watch this dude.

1622
01:27:18.590 --> 01:27:20.330
This shit is ridiculous.

1623
01:27:20.540 --> 01:27:24.230
This guy's a bad mother fucker and he's a perfect example.
Why isn't it working?

1624
01:27:25.280 --> 01:27:29.620
Here it goes.
Watch this.
Okay.
Alright.
Hello.
Look at you.

1625
01:27:29.630 --> 01:27:34.100
The fucking kidding me.
Watch that shit again.
I mean,
that is incredible.

1626
01:27:34.630 --> 01:27:38.900
The Oscars,
but that was the wildest taekwondo shit I've ever seen.
Oof,
man.

1627
01:27:38.901 --> 01:27:43.880
Do they show that?
Yeah,
but look how good that is,
man.
That dude is wicked.

1628
01:27:43.881 --> 01:27:48.650
Gimme one more of those.
So that again,
one more time.
Oh God.
Damn.

1629
01:27:48.651 --> 01:27:51.920
That dude's good.
But it's like those type of techniques.

1630
01:27:51.921 --> 01:27:56.630
We're just starting to see now and kickboxing and MMA.
Look at this touch.
Bang.

1631
01:27:57.500 --> 01:28:01.220
Jumping,
spinning sidekick to the Mug.
I mean,

1632
01:28:01.221 --> 01:28:04.080
and then just go right on the Dick.
Bam.

1633
01:28:05.510 --> 01:28:09.350
That's fucking,
that's Oscar Martinez.
He's a,
he's a good,

1634
01:28:09.351 --> 01:28:12.660
he's a really good way to instruction and Colorado.
Just tell them,

1635
01:28:13.750 --> 01:28:16.700
well this fight was in Colorado.
Yeah,
this was in Denver.

1636
01:28:16.910 --> 01:28:18.020
I mean the guy's incredible.

1637
01:28:18.200 --> 01:28:21.890
But like you're starting to see those techniques and those techniques have

1638
01:28:21.891 --> 01:28:25.820
always existed in taekwondo tournament's but when you factor in leg kicks,

1639
01:28:25.821 --> 01:28:28.790
when you factor and take downs you,
it's very rare that you see them,

1640
01:28:28.970 --> 01:28:32.510
but you're starting to see those things emerged now because once you master all

1641
01:28:32.511 --> 01:28:33.410
those other things,

1642
01:28:33.710 --> 01:28:36.980
then you have this one thing in your arsenal the other guy doesn't have.

1643
01:28:36.981 --> 01:28:39.350
Once your takedown defense is good enough,
you can throw that stuff.

1644
01:28:40.150 --> 01:28:43.250
Once you're comfortable with being taken down,
you can do that stuff.
You know?

1645
01:28:43.340 --> 01:28:46.070
And when you're comfortable enough with your striking that you get that extra

1646
01:28:46.220 --> 01:28:48.590
extra Lucentis,
just that extra gap.

1647
01:28:48.890 --> 01:28:52.640
And there's some guys that just have wicked spinning techniques and if you have

1648
01:28:52.641 --> 01:28:55.190
those techniques,
but did you see honey Jason Land,

1649
01:28:55.191 --> 01:28:58.460
that spinning elbow couple of a couple of times landed that spinning elbow and

1650
01:28:58.461 --> 01:29:01.950
it's fight this past weekend.
Sweet timing would just

1651
01:29:02.010 --> 01:29:05.120
<v 10>add another.
It's just another added l train to the elbows.</v>

1652
01:29:05.140 --> 01:29:08.120
Obviously we didn't want the pads and such,
but you got to Washington sparring.

1653
01:29:08.130 --> 01:29:09.720
Just do a little drills and everything like grinder.

1654
01:29:09.730 --> 01:29:11.530
Lb drills don't work the elbows,
but what?

1655
01:29:11.600 --> 01:29:14.880
I'm curious to see what spinning elbow history when,
how he trained at the bank.

1656
01:29:14.940 --> 01:29:19.620
It was beautiful man.
It was beautiful.
He slipped it in inside of a guy's Jab,

1657
01:29:19.800 --> 01:29:24.210
like he slipped.
Okay.
Jab,
slip the jab and went right into when Bam.

1658
01:29:24.211 --> 01:29:27.090
I mean it was really nice timing.
Okay.
They'll see what you're seeing.

1659
01:29:27.091 --> 01:29:30.900
More of that.
You've seen more spinning back fist and left elbow.
We'll kicks.

1660
01:29:31.200 --> 01:29:33.990
I was right elbow I think.
I believe.
I believe.
I'm going to have to see it again,

1661
01:29:34.200 --> 01:29:38.000
but yeah,
sorry.
Oh yeah.
I'm pretty sure he slipped it a left Atlanta,

1662
01:29:38.040 --> 01:29:41.820
right elbow know?
Yeah,
slip to his right leg and her right elbow.

1663
01:29:41.860 --> 01:29:42.730
She said things like that.

1664
01:29:42.740 --> 01:29:45.740
Then we just bounced like combinations and things off each other and we're just

1665
01:29:45.741 --> 01:29:48.990
like,
we just did.
We'd take off on some combinations.
You should watch that.

1666
01:29:49.020 --> 01:29:51.720
There's a couple of moments in that fight,

1667
01:29:51.780 --> 01:29:54.180
especially in the first round when he landed that elbows like dies.

1668
01:29:54.181 --> 01:29:58.110
One of the nicest executed spending almost I've ever seen and he'll fix,

1669
01:29:58.111 --> 01:30:00.810
you know,
a lot of those.
I was too busy doing a Dwayne Bank seminar.

1670
01:30:01.290 --> 01:30:04.650
We didn't get to watch the fights we were doing.
Where were you guys?

1671
01:30:05.060 --> 01:30:08.940
The team Alpha male jam at ultimate fitness.
I must've been a mob show.

1672
01:30:09.290 --> 01:30:10.770
It was good.
We had a good out for sure.

1673
01:30:13.690 --> 01:30:16.740
We did built rankings and stuff too,
so that's pretty cool.
Does anybody,

1674
01:30:16.741 --> 01:30:19.770
I'm a black phone.
Your system?
I have one,
a one black,
but other than me,

1675
01:30:19.980 --> 01:30:23.340
I guess it gave myself known black Bubba.
Why Mcdonald's in Rochester?
New York.

1676
01:30:23.690 --> 01:30:24.421
He's a his,

1677
01:30:24.421 --> 01:30:28.080
he's a partner with the Chris Herzog who's one of the main guys in 10th planet.

1678
01:30:28.560 --> 01:30:32.910
Oh,
that's awesome man.
So there's only one black,
the black bag.
Yeah.

1679
01:30:32.940 --> 01:30:36.520
And then when brought one current brown belt,
which is Tj Dillashaw,
Tj Dillashaw,

1680
01:30:36.521 --> 01:30:39.870
I was the only black brown belt.
Yes sir.
Just got it.
Yeah.
Two days ago.

1681
01:30:40.080 --> 01:30:42.080
Two days ago.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Huge.
Yeah.

1682
01:30:42.110 --> 01:30:45.000
I think it is important to set the goal ranking in the structure and and

1683
01:30:45.001 --> 01:30:47.880
everything with the curriculum.
I think from the system it's a,
you get something.

1684
01:30:48.120 --> 01:30:50.940
Is it a steady progression for people to follow through on things and be

1685
01:30:50.941 --> 01:30:53.820
committed to goals as humans are?
Right.
We just committed to goals,
goal oriented.

1686
01:30:54.170 --> 01:30:56.700
I had a conversation with that about a dad who was a,

1687
01:30:56.730 --> 01:30:58.980
he was like thinking that belts were bullshit.

1688
01:30:59.220 --> 01:31:01.820
His kid was taking martial arts and he's like,
you know,

1689
01:31:02.420 --> 01:31:05.280
belts are trying to nonsense though,
right?
Like if a guy can beat your ass,

1690
01:31:05.281 --> 01:31:07.170
you can beat your ass.
I'm like,
yeah,

1691
01:31:07.171 --> 01:31:11.340
but no because it's really good for like you get,
like when I got my blue belt,

1692
01:31:11.341 --> 01:31:13.080
I remember I was on a TV show,

1693
01:31:13.110 --> 01:31:16.280
but I was happier about getting my blue belt and like almost anything else.

1694
01:31:16.300 --> 01:31:20.490
I was like,
man,
I'm not a white belt anymore.
Jitsu.

1695
01:31:20.780 --> 01:31:24.870
I remember that and that,
that as a grown man was a big deal to me.

1696
01:31:24.900 --> 01:31:26.670
But as a kid that's giant,

1697
01:31:26.700 --> 01:31:29.610
awesome to show that a kid can progress and they learn.

1698
01:31:29.611 --> 01:31:33.080
They get new belts and names of accomplishment or something huge,
huge.

1699
01:31:33.250 --> 01:31:35.330
Just give me my black belt a couple of months ago,
man,

1700
01:31:35.400 --> 01:31:37.470
I was happy that I was still having to thinking about that man.

1701
01:31:37.471 --> 01:31:38.980
That was just awesome to go from Boston,

1702
01:31:40.350 --> 01:31:43.430
from Basra giant Ms Diet for me for sure man.

1703
01:31:43.440 --> 01:31:46.560
I'm such a fan of the sport and a fan of him and just left Marsh Larson came up

1704
01:31:46.561 --> 01:31:49.550
through the traditional more stars on it and respect or that'd be doing kitchen

1705
01:31:49.570 --> 01:31:53.310
Christ since I was eight and then in Thai boxing was 15 so I just martial arts

1706
01:31:53.311 --> 01:31:56.010
this meme and it's why I'm here to teach and be a martial artist.

1707
01:31:56.160 --> 01:31:59.860
I love the boss route and is really honest about his,
about fights.

1708
01:31:59.861 --> 01:32:03.460
Do you know he keeps it real you Jon Jones,
I poke thing.

1709
01:32:03.461 --> 01:32:06.910
He was really honest about that and the way said it was really fascinating

1710
01:32:06.911 --> 01:32:09.880
because he goes,
look,
he goes,
he's very relaxed in that cage.

1711
01:32:09.880 --> 01:32:13.360
She's making things up,
he's doing what he wants to do.
He's not in a panic.

1712
01:32:13.660 --> 01:32:16.990
And I was like,
if so if he's doing it,
he's poking in the eye.

1713
01:32:17.020 --> 01:32:19.690
It's either intentional or what he's doing is causing it,

1714
01:32:19.691 --> 01:32:23.650
is aware it's causing and he's not changing it,
you know?
And he's like,
you know,

1715
01:32:23.651 --> 01:32:27.130
I think the guy is a great fighter but this is what I believe.
And I'm like,
wow.

1716
01:32:27.150 --> 01:32:30.040
I mean that's what he always does.
He keeps it as real,

1717
01:32:30.130 --> 01:32:33.850
as real gets read with them or disagree with them.

1718
01:32:33.851 --> 01:32:37.340
You will get 100% what bas Rutten thinks when bas Rutten is talking about.

1719
01:32:37.430 --> 01:32:39.930
That's one result we had a strong connection to when we were at training because

1720
01:32:40.050 --> 01:32:42.130
I believed he knew what he was doing.

1721
01:32:42.400 --> 01:32:45.250
And when he would ask me to do a technique or a combination,

1722
01:32:45.610 --> 01:32:46.840
it was from his heart.

1723
01:32:46.841 --> 01:32:50.620
And it was something that he chose to tell me cause he fit.
It fit my style.

1724
01:32:50.621 --> 01:32:53.310
So we had a great combination,
a great relation.
That's what I fell at.

1725
01:32:53.311 --> 01:32:56.050
Tj and I talked.
We have a great man.
It's,
it's fricking awesome.

1726
01:32:56.051 --> 01:32:59.120
And I feel like the Bond Boston I have.
Yeah,
we have that as well.

1727
01:32:59.270 --> 01:33:01.510
He's not going to bullshit me.
Absolutely.

1728
01:33:01.720 --> 01:33:05.080
Did you learn anything from boss about like boss is pretty open about the fact

1729
01:33:05.081 --> 01:33:08.070
that he kind of red line is body fucking with

1730
01:33:10.540 --> 01:33:11.470
this guy too,
man.

1731
01:33:12.370 --> 01:33:15.220
<v 1>I mean he,
he did too much.
He shouldn't have been 55 pounder.</v>

1732
01:33:15.400 --> 01:33:18.250
He was going too hard all the time.
He was too OCD about training.

1733
01:33:18.460 --> 01:33:20.470
Being OCD for a coach is all right.

1734
01:33:20.500 --> 01:33:23.620
You know you're going to make all your athletes better.
Being OCD as an athlete,

1735
01:33:23.621 --> 01:33:26.020
you gotta be careful.
You have to have people around you to make you slow down.

1736
01:33:26.021 --> 01:33:29.440
Like Uriah has done a great job with me.
When I got in the gym,
I wouldn't stop.

1737
01:33:29.441 --> 01:33:32.560
I'd be in there.
I lived in the gym.
That's all I did.
He's like,
Hey man,

1738
01:33:32.561 --> 01:33:35.320
get an escape.
Get out of here.
Go do something.
You know,
have some fun.

1739
01:33:35.321 --> 01:33:39.110
Like don't be so like in here always killing yourself because it's going to

1740
01:33:39.111 --> 01:33:41.200
hinder you enter your body and your performance.

1741
01:33:41.350 --> 01:33:44.980
How valuable is having a guy like your right as a friend and a mentor.

1742
01:33:45.130 --> 01:33:48.820
And how weird does that put you in a position because you guys are in the same

1743
01:33:48.821 --> 01:33:53.320
weight class now and he wants to be a world champion.
Yeah,
I mean it's crazy,

1744
01:33:53.321 --> 01:33:54.330
dude.
He's a good dude.
I mean,

1745
01:33:54.331 --> 01:33:58.660
he saw after he lost his umbrella that that quick stoppage that he's willing to

1746
01:33:58.750 --> 01:34:00.310
give my name a shout on wall,

1747
01:34:00.311 --> 01:34:02.420
like one of the worst things that could happen to you,
you know?
And uh,

1748
01:34:02.590 --> 01:34:05.440
so it shows this great character and that's tough for me because I've looked up

1749
01:34:05.441 --> 01:34:06.550
to the guy,
I have copied him.

1750
01:34:06.551 --> 01:34:08.710
I've done a lot of stuff from my career because of him.

1751
01:34:09.010 --> 01:34:11.380
And it's going to be tough if that situation ever comes about.
I mean,

1752
01:34:11.381 --> 01:34:13.150
I don't want to have to fight the guy,
you know what I mean?

1753
01:34:13.480 --> 01:34:14.650
He's brought me up in the sport.

1754
01:34:15.010 --> 01:34:20.010
But it seems like a very honest and open approach that you're taking though.

1755
01:34:20.290 --> 01:34:23.470
It's like there's no ego involved there and you're,
you know,

1756
01:34:23.740 --> 01:34:26.110
the way you're looking at it as a very healthy yeah.
It's,

1757
01:34:26.660 --> 01:34:30.250
you're being very honest about,
um,
him being a mentor.

1758
01:34:30.280 --> 01:34:33.780
You even copying a lot of his attributes,
his positive attributes.
Yeah,

1759
01:34:34.110 --> 01:34:37.180
it's a tough situation for sure,
man.
I mean,
like I said,

1760
01:34:37.181 --> 01:34:40.270
I looked up to him and he,
I mean I owe a lot to him.
To what?
For where I'm at,

1761
01:34:40.640 --> 01:34:42.770
<v 10>I'm talking to you guys right now because here I favor.
Yeah,</v>

1762
01:34:42.950 --> 01:34:44.960
I'm sitting here because if he texted me one night and said,

1763
01:34:45.290 --> 01:34:48.350
can you come be our trainer?
Yeah.
I owe a lot to that as well.

1764
01:34:48.351 --> 01:34:51.560
That is the weirdest thing when it comes to fighters where they trained together

1765
01:34:51.561 --> 01:34:52.980
and then they have to fight together.
You know,

1766
01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:54.950
even if it's just on a short period of time.

1767
01:34:54.951 --> 01:34:58.250
Like I was talking to Brendan Schaub the other night,
train with our Laski quite

1768
01:34:58.250 --> 01:35:01.430
<v 7>a bit,
and now he's fighting him and less than two weeks in Vancouver.</v>

1769
01:35:01.431 --> 01:35:03.800
And that's a little bit different situation even into that because I mean

1770
01:35:03.801 --> 01:35:06.470
yesterday chain with them a little bit here.
I've done every day

1771
01:35:06.600 --> 01:35:10.170
<v 3>practice underneath Uriah every,
I've been for four years now.</v>

1772
01:35:10.171 --> 01:35:13.380
I've been at your eyes,
gym nonstop.
I haven't gone anywhere else to train for.

1773
01:35:13.390 --> 01:35:16.660
It was extended period of time.
I've been there.
And uh,
you know,

1774
01:35:16.680 --> 01:35:18.390
I was going to be tough when we're,
we're good friends,
you know,

1775
01:35:18.391 --> 01:35:19.980
we're like a family.
Everyone in that gym,

1776
01:35:19.981 --> 01:35:22.980
we've created little family to where you got that guy's back,

1777
01:35:22.981 --> 01:35:26.250
your eyes fight in July 5th,
I would love to go off and take a huge break and,

1778
01:35:26.440 --> 01:35:28.770
and relax a little bit,
but I got to come back and help your eye out.
You know,

1779
01:35:28.771 --> 01:35:29.431
I've got to get in the gym,

1780
01:35:29.431 --> 01:35:33.930
help run some practices and give them some looks and stuff because I care if he

1781
01:35:33.931 --> 01:35:34.764
wins or not.

1782
01:35:35.260 --> 01:35:39.210
And so since we all care about each other that much that we're gonna hold each

1783
01:35:39.211 --> 01:35:41.490
other accountable for being a practice.
And you saw a crazy,
they didn't,

1784
01:35:41.491 --> 01:35:45.750
when I won the belt,
you know like they were front row going insane and,
and that,

1785
01:35:45.751 --> 01:35:47.830
that made me tear up more than even like me actually went in.

1786
01:35:47.831 --> 01:35:50.610
The bell is going back and watch him fight pass and seeing those guys react to

1787
01:35:50.611 --> 01:35:52.140
me winning,
you know.
Wow.

1788
01:35:52.170 --> 01:35:56.610
So yeah it's a crazy situation that we can be put in but you know,

1789
01:35:56.611 --> 01:35:59.070
I mean they want the drama behind the fights.

1790
01:35:59.071 --> 01:36:02.020
So I mean maybe if they're willing to shell out the cash,
me,
me,

1791
01:36:02.030 --> 01:36:04.090
me and your ill have a smile on her face while fighting.

1792
01:36:04.490 --> 01:36:07.930
<v 7>Wow.
That would be crazy.
Yeah.
You're the extreme opposite end of this,</v>

1793
01:36:07.940 --> 01:36:09.480
of this extreme end of the spectrum.

1794
01:36:09.481 --> 01:36:12.240
There's The r Lawsky and shop guys who have respect for each other but they

1795
01:36:12.241 --> 01:36:15.510
weren't really good friends and there's you and your ride.
We're almost family.

1796
01:36:15.530 --> 01:36:16.230
Yeah.

1797
01:36:16.230 --> 01:36:21.230
And you're in that situation where you fight in the gym on a regular basis,

1798
01:36:21.570 --> 01:36:24.210
do you mean,
I mean,
if the UFC really wants us to watch his fight,

1799
01:36:24.211 --> 01:36:26.740
just come to practice,
you know,
just bring a camera crew in.

1800
01:36:26.760 --> 01:36:28.340
And that's one thing about me.
Yeah.

1801
01:36:28.400 --> 01:36:31.760
<v 3>Right.
Tuesday,
we both got like this ego thing too,
and we'll throw it down.</v>

1802
01:36:31.790 --> 01:36:35.210
I mean,
sometimes we have some sparring matches.
Look like brothers fighting.

1803
01:36:35.550 --> 01:36:39.640
<v 7>I think just keep it,
it man,
like just a ball of craziness going everywhere,</v>

1804
01:36:39.641 --> 01:36:42.400
you know?
And uh,
it's fun.
I mean,
that's why we've gotten so much better.

1805
01:36:42.401 --> 01:36:43.800
It's pushing each other that hot water wash,

1806
01:36:44.010 --> 01:36:46.210
you see fights everyday or every once a week.
Anyway,

1807
01:36:46.420 --> 01:36:48.820
this must be a weird position for you to be in,

1808
01:36:48.970 --> 01:36:53.140
to be the guy with the video game controller and you see these guys adopting

1809
01:36:53.141 --> 01:36:55.050
your techniques and getting better.
Like we,

1810
01:36:55.160 --> 01:36:59.230
we've talked about it on the commentary many times was there was a,

1811
01:36:59.300 --> 01:37:02.370
there was a jump.
I,
he knows guys were always murderers from the,

1812
01:37:02.440 --> 01:37:05.970
you mean from the first time they were in the WEC.
All those guys were murderers.

1813
01:37:05.971 --> 01:37:10.660
Benevidez has always been a killer.
Super Slick.
You got a lot of different,

1814
01:37:10.770 --> 01:37:12.940
different weapons in his,
in his toolbox.

1815
01:37:13.270 --> 01:37:17.420
But then a difference in his striking difference in Chad Mendez striking me,

1816
01:37:17.460 --> 01:37:18.600
you know,
all of them,
even if

1817
01:37:18.790 --> 01:37:21.370
<v 3>watched the fights,
if you just look at the stats alone,</v>

1818
01:37:21.700 --> 01:37:23.050
you could tell he's made a difference.
You know,

1819
01:37:23.051 --> 01:37:24.850
you don't even have to watch the fights too much better.
We've gotten,

1820
01:37:25.060 --> 01:37:28.860
just see the punches landed or us finishing fights on our feet now and uh,

1821
01:37:29.060 --> 01:37:30.430
you know,
that says it all there too.

1822
01:37:30.530 --> 01:37:32.480
<v 7>Yeah.
We've got to figure out a way to keep you guys together.</v>

1823
01:37:32.481 --> 01:37:33.980
This is ridiculous for sure,
man.

1824
01:37:34.280 --> 01:37:38.230
Definitely a special time in martial arts history and it really is 100% of that

1825
01:37:38.231 --> 01:37:40.190
has to be taken into consideration.
Duane Ludwig,

1826
01:37:40.191 --> 01:37:42.550
you can't just fucking fly off to Colorado.
We had a,

1827
01:37:42.551 --> 01:37:44.120
we had a practice of the day and he's like,
all right,

1828
01:37:44.121 --> 01:37:47.530
my last practice is Tuesday.
Just as like,
oh,
of next year,
right?
Yeah.

1829
01:37:47.890 --> 01:37:49.820
Like you just want them to,
no one wants him to go,
man.
I mean,

1830
01:37:50.060 --> 01:37:54.620
he created this serious magic.
That's Jim,
but we don't want them to go.
Yeah,

1831
01:37:54.621 --> 01:37:55.950
that shit to be worked out.
Let's,

1832
01:37:56.100 --> 01:37:59.400
<v 0>we'll talk later about that.
It needs to be worked out good.</v>

1833
01:37:59.401 --> 01:38:02.310
And talk about this later.
Um,
the other guys in the gym,
um,

1834
01:38:02.330 --> 01:38:05.250
Chad Mendez is about to fight Joseph Aldo for a second fight.

1835
01:38:05.251 --> 01:38:08.520
That's another really intense,
really interesting fight.

1836
01:38:08.730 --> 01:38:13.140
Trina guy in Mendez who was always a beast,
but it's clearly gotten better.

1837
01:38:13.480 --> 01:38:14.380
Are you going to work with them?

1838
01:38:15.500 --> 01:38:18.810
<v 6>It depends on my,
in my,
uh,
already finished,
at least in my house cause I was uh,</v>

1839
01:38:19.730 --> 01:38:22.760
just married,
made a decision to leave June 12th,
because that's when my,

1840
01:38:22.761 --> 01:38:25.340
when we signed the lease is over.
So in order subpoena stay,

1841
01:38:25.790 --> 01:38:27.860
I'd have to stay for two more months and I got the,

1842
01:38:27.890 --> 01:38:30.230
some things happening in Colorado right now with the business and my house out

1843
01:38:30.231 --> 01:38:32.480
there.
So I've got to figure some things out if I can stay,

1844
01:38:32.690 --> 01:38:34.550
I'm not looking to move twice.
I,
uh,

1845
01:38:34.880 --> 01:38:37.160
if we could stay in the house that I was getting,
I'm currently renting,

1846
01:38:37.580 --> 01:38:38.820
then just extend the lease.
Then

1847
01:38:39.140 --> 01:38:43.520
<v 0>she made some phone calls.
Can we happen here when we asked for the world title?</v>

1848
01:38:43.800 --> 01:38:47.210
Yeah.
You know,
appraiser to be,
if Chad under your tutelage get wins a world.

1849
01:38:47.780 --> 01:38:51.910
<v 6>I think,
I don't think he needs me,
but uh,
I think his chances are better with me.</v>

1850
01:38:52.150 --> 01:38:55.240
I want it to be there.
There was a,
um,
it,
it was just a,

1851
01:38:55.360 --> 01:39:00.000
the date the date was set before his title was announced.
I think,
um,

1852
01:39:00.100 --> 01:39:01.480
for me to leave out,
I was actually,

1853
01:39:01.490 --> 01:39:04.190
I'm not my question how much just say what about this situation?
But um,

1854
01:39:04.910 --> 01:39:09.060
I didn't think the day,
I didn't pick the date.
Yeah.
Um,
yeah,

1855
01:39:09.090 --> 01:39:12.250
but I'm trying to help him stay for sure.
It's definitely good.
He was the guy,

1856
01:39:12.251 --> 01:39:15.100
I thought it was going to get the boat first just because I've seen him closer

1857
01:39:15.101 --> 01:39:16.480
to the rankings and the other guys.

1858
01:39:16.810 --> 01:39:20.690
But then obviously this guy has to go ahead and get bad ass.

1859
01:39:21.730 --> 01:39:25.130
It was a Benevides and then Uriah and then Tj now,

1860
01:39:25.131 --> 01:39:27.910
now Chan to win in opposite rotation that I was thinking anyway,

1861
01:39:27.911 --> 01:39:30.310
but his guy that I felt would get the tower shot,

1862
01:39:30.311 --> 01:39:34.120
we'll get the title shot and get the title first and I do believe that he can't

1863
01:39:34.121 --> 01:39:34.954
be all though.

1864
01:39:35.100 --> 01:39:39.350
<v 0>Um,
Benevidez is going to probably eventually get another shot and I hope so</v>

1865
01:39:39.400 --> 01:39:40.430
<v 6>man man,
that was,
that was,</v>

1866
01:39:40.870 --> 01:39:44.290
that was my low as far as being out here tomorrow from l four year and a half.

1867
01:39:44.500 --> 01:39:47.650
That was the lowest part.
Lois.
I think for me like that,
that,

1868
01:39:47.651 --> 01:39:51.550
that I passionately careful care about my eyes and to see him lose and he's like

1869
01:39:51.551 --> 01:39:52.510
that.
I thought that hurt my feelings

1870
01:39:52.770 --> 01:39:53.700
<v 0>for folks who don't know,</v>

1871
01:39:54.030 --> 01:39:57.420
Benevidez got caught with a right hand early in the first round and got knocked

1872
01:39:57.421 --> 01:40:01.140
out by a guy in mighty mouse Johnson who's probably one of the,
you know,

1873
01:40:01.230 --> 01:40:03.570
at least top three guys pound for pound in the world.

1874
01:40:04.080 --> 01:40:06.920
But you know Benevidez when he's at his best is right there as well.

1875
01:40:07.140 --> 01:40:11.860
That Tim Elliot fight was why the fight man?
I thought or the,

1876
01:40:11.861 --> 01:40:13.930
the tighter if I thought for sure he was.
And when the bell,
sure.

1877
01:40:14.030 --> 01:40:18.390
His amount is like a God damn mountain on top of you.

1878
01:40:18.600 --> 01:40:21.270
That amount.
It's just all these kinds of his pills.

1879
01:40:21.290 --> 01:40:24.690
You're locked on top of Elliot and you were like Whoa,
this is a crazy amount.

1880
01:40:24.930 --> 01:40:27.810
There's levels of mount,
you know,
there's some guys that like,

1881
01:40:27.960 --> 01:40:31.800
cause like Damien Maia and his last fight,
he's got that ridiculous amount.

1882
01:40:31.980 --> 01:40:34.680
You know Damien Maia gets on top of you and it's just a little bump.

1883
01:40:34.920 --> 01:40:36.570
He just locks down on you and you're like,

1884
01:40:36.670 --> 01:40:40.020
you're not bucking that guy off of you and Benevidez with dad.

1885
01:40:40.470 --> 01:40:44.040
He gets one arm anywhere near underneath your chin.
So all these guys,

1886
01:40:44.100 --> 01:40:48.960
right Blake's to Joe constrict their own C.
Right.
But uh,

1887
01:40:49.260 --> 01:40:51.870
he traps both your arms or one year olds.
Just depends if you,

1888
01:40:51.880 --> 01:40:53.980
if you have one hand trying to that choke,
you're screwed.

1889
01:40:54.100 --> 01:40:56.410
<v 3>Yeah.
So just such a good job of tracking and with his legs,</v>

1890
01:40:56.411 --> 01:40:59.080
he's got such good body control on that.
And uh,

1891
01:40:59.140 --> 01:41:03.010
that's why I will never get cotton Nagy teeny anymore,
man.
Cause inhibit favor,

1892
01:41:03.011 --> 01:41:05.140
man.
Those guys are killers on the neck.

1893
01:41:05.141 --> 01:41:07.450
So I'm sure what the best choke defense ever.

1894
01:41:07.670 --> 01:41:10.760
<v 10>I'm sure the progression of all these guys,
man,
they're all just,</v>

1895
01:41:10.761 --> 01:41:12.260
it's just the whole iron sharpens iron.

1896
01:41:12.470 --> 01:41:15.440
Like of course I'm getting a bunch of credit for it and I'll take all of it of

1897
01:41:15.441 --> 01:41:16.880
course.
But man,
these guys,

1898
01:41:16.881 --> 01:41:19.640
I mean the one guy gets better and just shows off to the next grade the next
day.

1899
01:41:19.641 --> 01:41:22.070
So it's what you said it best.
Do you have a bunch of race cars?

1900
01:41:22.200 --> 01:41:23.330
They were already race cars.

1901
01:41:23.420 --> 01:41:26.090
I mean it wasn't like you came around to guys that are just,
you know,

1902
01:41:26.270 --> 01:41:29.240
they've only done marathons and I've never thrown a punch in their life.

1903
01:41:29.241 --> 01:41:29.451
You know,

1904
01:41:29.451 --> 01:41:32.840
you know you're getting like the elite of the elite and you're training them.

1905
01:41:32.900 --> 01:41:35.870
Just tuned him up a little bit that that fight with Tim Elliot was the first

1906
01:41:35.871 --> 01:41:39.710
time I ever saw a guy tap with his feet.
Yeah.
Both of his arms were trap.

1907
01:41:39.810 --> 01:41:43.330
It really was like a fucking,
like a viper.
Like,
oh,
like a snake,

1908
01:41:43.331 --> 01:41:48.070
like an anaconda choking.
Someone who just got on top of the fucking shit out.

1909
01:41:48.430 --> 01:41:50.120
Yeah.
Yeah.
Wicked,
wicked ground.

1910
01:41:50.121 --> 01:41:51.890
That wasn't one of the craziest fights I've watched.

1911
01:41:52.250 --> 01:41:56.050
The energy that Elliot brought out and that was,
he's a Gamer hunt.

1912
01:41:56.180 --> 01:41:57.740
It was tricky to game plan for him.

1913
01:41:57.770 --> 01:42:01.160
It was tricky for me to create what aspect of you is to do the things I thought

1914
01:42:01.161 --> 01:42:03.230
were gonna be successful.
He's strong shit,
man.

1915
01:42:03.770 --> 01:42:06.950
He's strong as shit and his endurance is incredible and he could take it,
man.

1916
01:42:06.951 --> 01:42:09.500
You see that fight with bug routine off.
You fought a,

1917
01:42:09.501 --> 01:42:13.520
I leave Boggo teen off and they went to war for fucking three rounds.

1918
01:42:13.730 --> 01:42:17.140
He took everything but the kitchen sink from Fargo teen off talking with Tina

1919
01:42:17.141 --> 01:42:20.270
off was teeing off on him and [inaudible] was a better striker.

1920
01:42:20.270 --> 01:42:23.770
It was smoother and quicker,
but Elliot never kept stopped coming after him.

1921
01:42:23.790 --> 01:42:28.620
Never is a Zombie.
Yup.
He's,
and he's very physically strong to like the gout.

1922
01:42:28.621 --> 01:42:32.510
No fight.
Ragdolled God,
no around.
Yeah.
Yeah.
He's,
he's strong as fuck man.

1923
01:42:32.511 --> 01:42:33.344
For a little dude.

1924
01:42:33.410 --> 01:42:38.410
Is he finding Demetrius now see [inaudible] office [inaudible] office fighting

1925
01:42:38.570 --> 01:42:42.670
less than two weeks in Vancouver.
It's the main event.
That's a good fight gun.

1926
01:42:42.740 --> 01:42:43.311
That's good file.

1927
01:42:43.311 --> 01:42:46.110
I want to see if that guy can keep it up and the fourth and fifth right?
Yeah,

1928
01:42:46.570 --> 01:42:49.940
because mighty mouse,
he's,
you better be in fucking shape.

1929
01:42:49.941 --> 01:42:53.060
You'd better bring your lunch.
I never stopped moving.
It's true.

1930
01:42:53.200 --> 01:42:55.640
It's like all the two from familiar guys when they have endless energy.

1931
01:42:55.730 --> 01:42:58.820
Do you ever foresee a possible super fight you and mighty mouse?

1932
01:42:58.880 --> 01:43:03.110
I wouldn't do that cause it can mighty mouse go up to 35 I can make 25 can you

1933
01:43:03.111 --> 01:43:05.210
really?
Holy Shit.

1934
01:43:05.600 --> 01:43:06.280
<v 3>35 pounder.</v>

1935
01:43:06.280 --> 01:43:11.250
I mean forcing myself to get big as big as I could possibly get to 155 pounds.

1936
01:43:11.680 --> 01:43:15.050
I'm lean.
I mean during camp,
if I'm just like not trying to get big,

1937
01:43:15.051 --> 01:43:18.500
not doing the strength conditioning,
uh,
I can get,
I'll be like foreign 48

1938
01:43:20.060 --> 01:43:24.140
what do you think mighty mouse walks around at how big he is?

1939
01:43:24.470 --> 01:43:27.110
35 49 his biggest if try to get to 20 pounds over,

1940
01:43:27.111 --> 01:43:31.130
I bet that his biggest is that normal for most guys?
Probably.

1941
01:43:31.131 --> 01:43:33.980
Is it a percentage of body weight?
More than it is?
Yeah.

1942
01:43:33.981 --> 01:43:36.800
Maybe percentage of body weight to,
cause the bigger guys can lose more weight.

1943
01:43:36.840 --> 01:43:39.630
Yeah.
It's easier for them to lose it.
Um,
but,

1944
01:43:39.640 --> 01:43:42.780
and it's also how lean you stayed throughout the year.
I mean I stay really lean,

1945
01:43:43.020 --> 01:43:46.970
I mean as,
as possibly as I can.
And so that's why I'm weighing as light as I can.

1946
01:43:47.090 --> 01:43:49.790
If I were to get,
if I were to give it,
put some fat on,

1947
01:43:49.791 --> 01:43:52.220
sure I can get up in the 60s but that's useless.
Wait,

1948
01:43:52.221 --> 01:43:53.780
I got to lose that again to start camp.

1949
01:43:53.860 --> 01:43:56.170
<v 7>If you got like Damon Wayans in the great white hope,</v>

1950
01:43:56.171 --> 01:43:58.330
remember when he got that big belly?
Who's the champion?

1951
01:43:58.690 --> 01:44:00.700
Because he wasn't to fight a white dude.
He didn't worry about it.

1952
01:44:03.220 --> 01:44:06.100
But that's what's cool too.
These guys are close to wait.

1953
01:44:06.101 --> 01:44:06.940
So when they're in the gym,

1954
01:44:06.941 --> 01:44:09.490
the focus to get better at the martial arts and not just to lose weight.

1955
01:44:09.491 --> 01:44:12.940
You know,
so it definitely makes a difference also.
That is a big God damned deal,

1956
01:44:12.941 --> 01:44:16.090
man.
The weight cutting.
Yeah.
It's a real dangerous part of our sport.

1957
01:44:16.150 --> 01:44:20.950
I think people cut weight too much weight
thrown to yes it does,
right?

1958
01:44:20.980 --> 01:44:24.970
Yep.
And when you hear about guys cutting,
you know,

1959
01:44:24.971 --> 01:44:29.500
30 pounds like the glace and Tebows of the world,
he's,
he's the most,

1960
01:44:30.250 --> 01:44:31.390
the most ridiculous.

1961
01:44:31.540 --> 01:44:36.540
That guy weighs one 55 at the weigh in for like five seconds and then you see

1962
01:44:36.641 --> 01:44:40.450
him the next day.
85 2085 that's insane.
He's so big.

1963
01:44:40.510 --> 01:44:43.080
I don't even feel like I can move if I gained that much weight after weights.

1964
01:44:43.120 --> 01:44:46.660
Like I don't know how he does it.
I wonder if it's a,

1965
01:44:47.200 --> 01:44:51.810
there's a difference to the composition of each person's body to some people can

1966
01:44:51.820 --> 01:44:52.990
get away with it.
Some people can't.

1967
01:44:53.020 --> 01:44:56.020
He's got to take like four ivy bags or something.
I don't know.

1968
01:44:56.021 --> 01:44:57.760
I don't know what he did,
but I've heard a four.

1969
01:44:57.970 --> 01:45:01.900
I've heard of guys talking before.
Yeah.
I've heard of guys taking blood out,

1970
01:45:02.200 --> 01:45:05.650
weighing in and putting the blood back in their body.
Oh Wow.
Yeah.

1971
01:45:05.890 --> 01:45:08.980
That was back in the dark days.
Hotel Room.

1972
01:45:09.040 --> 01:45:12.730
Fucking intravenous blood.
She's replenishing

1973
01:45:15.130 --> 01:45:19.870
some darkness once you started using needles and replenishing fluids and like

1974
01:45:21.160 --> 01:45:23.860
what are we doing exactly.
That's crazy.
Is there a way though?

1975
01:45:23.861 --> 01:45:26.170
Here's the question.
Here's the two gloves.

1976
01:45:26.210 --> 01:45:27.790
Here's a difference between the everglades club,

1977
01:45:28.780 --> 01:45:32.950
more padding on the top and that padding apparently is helping people keep from

1978
01:45:32.951 --> 01:45:37.420
breaking their hands on impacts
within it.
They're less knockouts.

1979
01:45:37.870 --> 01:45:41.970
Um,
I don't know.
That's a good question.
When they did the kid,
when Max,

1980
01:45:42.030 --> 01:45:45.460
the middleweight,
they specifically pulled in eight ounce gloves and ounce Rayez,

1981
01:45:45.490 --> 01:45:46.510
which is just kind of a horse.

1982
01:45:46.930 --> 01:45:49.180
They just moved the out of the way and it's just tape,

1983
01:45:49.210 --> 01:45:51.220
gauze and two pieces of leather.

1984
01:45:51.520 --> 01:45:54.970
No way less padding in it and then raise glove.
Then there,
then there,

1985
01:45:54.971 --> 01:45:57.590
there's an MMA gloves for sure,
but there's more padding on my Shin Sun.

1986
01:46:00.990 --> 01:46:04.780
Yeah,
right.
Elbows to,
yeah,
exactly.
Hell,
but God damn.

1987
01:46:04.781 --> 01:46:09.610
Especially like you seen in lion fight more than you're seeing glory because

1988
01:46:09.611 --> 01:46:13.170
those guys are allowed to throw elbows.
Guys getting cut up man.

1989
01:46:13.180 --> 01:46:13.960
I only landed like

1990
01:46:13.960 --> 01:46:17.590
<v 3>a good five or six elbows in that fight in my elbow hurts so bad still.</v>

1991
01:46:17.591 --> 01:46:19.360
I was like tender to touch it,
you know.

1992
01:46:19.670 --> 01:46:22.240
Well a lot of guys have to get shit like a Bursa sac.

1993
01:46:22.590 --> 01:46:24.160
Like you don't really like it burns in there.

1994
01:46:24.490 --> 01:46:27.460
Oh is it a did to get it checked out at all?
No,
not yet.

1995
01:46:29.080 --> 01:46:29.831
I haven't seriously.

1996
01:46:29.831 --> 01:46:32.370
I haven't had any time to do anything since I've been home since just fighting

1997
01:46:32.410 --> 01:46:36.520
mad whirlwind.
It's been,
it's been awesome but it's been crazy.
Just,
you know,

1998
01:46:36.521 --> 01:46:40.960
obviously interview after interview TV shows,
radio shows.
I mean I'm loving it.

1999
01:46:40.961 --> 01:46:43.570
I mean obviously it's the attention you want because this is how you get paid

2000
01:46:43.571 --> 01:46:46.870
more and this is what you've been working for.
But it's been a whirlwind man.

2001
01:46:46.871 --> 01:46:50.040
It's been,
it's been craziness.
I,
I was more busy now than

2002
01:46:50.040 --> 01:46:53.920
<v 7>it was in camp.
Is there a way to,
uh,</v>

2003
01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:58.140
have it so that guys fight at their actual weight?
Is there a way?

2004
01:46:59.730 --> 01:47:03.630
I don't think so.
Yeah.
I,
I doubt it.
No matter what.

2005
01:47:03.631 --> 01:47:06.810
People are going to do something to take it to advantage somehow the way costs

2006
01:47:06.811 --> 01:47:07.591
are enough to,
well I guess the way,

2007
01:47:07.591 --> 01:47:09.570
cause it's very now between a couple of doors away in,

2008
01:47:09.580 --> 01:47:13.530
in Wayne in an hour before you fight or not even weighing in like before you

2009
01:47:13.531 --> 01:47:16.190
walk out to the octagon,
step you on the scale,
you know,

2010
01:47:16.220 --> 01:47:18.680
what'd you do if someone was over?
We said it'd be a shame.
That's true.

2011
01:47:18.910 --> 01:47:21.660
They have to be 24 hours.
So those all those dishes out of the way.
It's true.

2012
01:47:22.020 --> 01:47:26.160
Yeah.
But that would be interesting man.
If you could put it on the fighter,

2013
01:47:26.520 --> 01:47:30.210
like where the audience would know that when the guy got on the scale that shows

2014
01:47:30.211 --> 01:47:31.440
it to the whole crowd.
Yeah.

2015
01:47:31.530 --> 01:47:36.530
Two Oh three five two oh 3.2 that just kind of,

2016
01:47:37.490 --> 01:47:40.650
yeah.
Yeah.
Well they have a backup fighter.
You know,

2017
01:47:40.970 --> 01:47:43.080
Chelsea did not make weight,
you know,

2018
01:47:43.081 --> 01:47:48.081
and then another guy gets up ratio shogun who way over there.

2019
01:47:48.870 --> 01:47:51.590
Put the check down.
Here we go.
Right.

2020
01:47:52.230 --> 01:47:55.650
Imagine if they had two guys you had to like,
like when you do Broadway,

2021
01:47:55.890 --> 01:47:59.550
you have someone who's a a backup singer,
but what do they call them?

2022
01:47:59.580 --> 01:48:02.270
An understudy?
Yeah,
and understanding.
Yeah,
you do.

2023
01:48:02.330 --> 01:48:06.000
Like you guys don't know Broadway,
so I guess that's what they do.

2024
01:48:06.001 --> 01:48:09.130
They have the actor and then there's an understudy for the actor in case the
act,

2025
01:48:09.131 --> 01:48:12.360
it take sick to understanding can always step in.
And if I was the understudy,

2026
01:48:12.361 --> 01:48:15.690
every put advising and that guy's water and like,
you know what I mean?
Like,
oh,

2027
01:48:15.691 --> 01:48:18.060
you're sick.
I'm in.
What?
Despise him,
dude.

2028
01:48:18.070 --> 01:48:21.030
Your wife gives you the shits like ridiculous or make it makes you feel like flu

2029
01:48:21.031 --> 01:48:24.000
symptoms really.
Supposedly.
Yeah.
You put the vice dean and someone's water,

2030
01:48:24.001 --> 01:48:26.690
it'll mess you up.
Shouldn't have probably broadcast that on the Internet.
Oh,

2031
01:48:27.120 --> 01:48:28.530
assholes all across the country

2032
01:48:32.560 --> 01:48:37.260
are with them and mentally break them.
Danny Castillo was at the fucking cvs.

2033
01:48:40.700 --> 01:48:43.820
You can have a big bag of by know.

2034
01:48:44.370 --> 01:48:48.330
How much time do you have now before you'll go back into training again?

2035
01:48:48.630 --> 01:48:51.720
And when do you think you'll,
you'll have the first defense of your title?

2036
01:48:51.780 --> 01:48:52.411
I'm not sure.

2037
01:48:52.411 --> 01:48:56.580
I got to obviously go in and talk to Dana with that and stuff to us says false.

2038
01:48:56.670 --> 01:49:01.580
Oh really?
Yes it does.
A mythbusters.
I guess there's something.

2039
01:49:01.880 --> 01:49:06.590
No,
it's just the internet and you want to drink some level.
This is a way though.

2040
01:49:06.600 --> 01:49:08.610
If you didn't use vaccine,
you could use something else.

2041
01:49:09.300 --> 01:49:11.160
Obviously some nasty shit you go good.

2042
01:49:11.161 --> 01:49:14.210
Let do is drop byZ and your shit now he'd be like,
nothing's hiring.

2043
01:49:14.720 --> 01:49:17.110
I'm fucking immune to that.

2044
01:49:19.630 --> 01:49:22.620
Yeah,
I don't,
I don't think it'd be Borow.
Um,
I doubt it.

2045
01:49:22.980 --> 01:49:25.410
I mean if I would have knocked him out in the first round and finished and then

2046
01:49:25.411 --> 01:49:28.470
I think I would have got an instant rematch with him,
but,
uh,
I feel like,

2047
01:49:28.471 --> 01:49:30.030
cause I dominated him for five rounds,

2048
01:49:30.031 --> 01:49:33.000
that they'll make him work his way back up.
At least that's my thought.

2049
01:49:33.001 --> 01:49:36.030
I don't know.
But isn't it about business for sure at this point.

2050
01:49:36.031 --> 01:49:38.850
And if you decided to have a rematch with him in Brazil,

2051
01:49:38.880 --> 01:49:40.380
like that's what his coach is saying.
You know,

2052
01:49:40.381 --> 01:49:44.790
if he was man enough come down to Brazil.
Yeah,
yeah.
Andre Pinera said that,
right?

2053
01:49:44.950 --> 01:49:48.070
Yeah.
You got to respect that.
He has to say that.
Of course it's going to say

2054
01:49:48.070 --> 01:49:51.440
<v 10>that Dwayne would say that too.
What's your title?
And it took a few,
you know,</v>

2055
01:49:51.460 --> 01:49:54.900
come on Sacramento Bitch.
You know what would be said?

2056
01:49:55.140 --> 01:49:58.480
So all that aside,
you know,
from a business standpoint,

2057
01:49:58.960 --> 01:50:03.380
if you could get out of Brazil alive,
I think that would be a good move.
No,

2058
01:50:03.880 --> 01:50:07.470
but yeah,
I don't know.
I Guess Better Vegas,
I'd really,

2059
01:50:07.480 --> 01:50:11.260
I'd find a five Vegas or somewhere like that.
I mean the champ.
Yeah,
that's true.

2060
01:50:11.440 --> 01:50:14.690
I mean Brazil is a,
I love Brazil.
I went down there vacation,
loved it,

2061
01:50:14.700 --> 01:50:16.960
went down there,
fought hey.
You know,
it was all right.
You know,

2062
01:50:17.500 --> 01:50:19.000
I feel like I feel like the fan,

2063
01:50:19.001 --> 01:50:21.520
so I'm not saying that like the judges do it on purpose or anything,

2064
01:50:21.730 --> 01:50:25.810
but I feel like the fans play a huge part in scoring in scoring cards down
there.

2065
01:50:26.070 --> 01:50:29.650
Yeah.
But look you,
there's been some bad decisions against Brazilians in Brazil.

2066
01:50:29.680 --> 01:50:32.440
Like okay,
Phil Davis and Leo Machida.
Yeah.

2067
01:50:32.620 --> 01:50:34.390
I did not think to Phil Davis won that fight.

2068
01:50:34.391 --> 01:50:36.920
I thought it was a very close fight,
but I thought Liotta Machita wanted to,

2069
01:50:37.030 --> 01:50:40.330
I thought if it is in Brazil for surely Odo got the,
got the nod,

2070
01:50:40.690 --> 01:50:43.600
but when they gave it to Phil Davis,
I was like,
wow,
that's interesting.

2071
01:50:43.810 --> 01:50:47.470
I wonder if maybe they hear that they're biased and they're embarrassed by that.

2072
01:50:47.471 --> 01:50:50.830
So they try to fight against it and you know,
I don't know.
I don't know.

2073
01:50:51.250 --> 01:50:54.400
I don't know.
But you're the champ.
So Vegas,
it is

2074
01:50:56.320 --> 01:51:00.470
reason judges should all the trainer be martial artists?
Hundred percent.
Yeah,

2075
01:51:00.550 --> 01:51:03.760
that's for sure.
What do you think could be done to improve the scoring system?

2076
01:51:03.761 --> 01:51:04.990
I know with your mad mind,

2077
01:51:04.991 --> 01:51:06.910
you've probably sat down and thought about that as well,

2078
01:51:07.030 --> 01:51:09.820
just to bring it a martial artist.
I understand the system being educated,

2079
01:51:09.850 --> 01:51:12.310
but do you think the 10 nines are just too prevalent?

2080
01:51:12.550 --> 01:51:15.490
Oh guys get knocked down like the first round your fight.

2081
01:51:15.970 --> 01:51:18.040
What's a fucking for sure a ten eight round.

2082
01:51:18.310 --> 01:51:21.040
How many guys put in ten eight though?
Did you even look at the car?

2083
01:51:21.280 --> 01:51:24.870
Not One of them.
Not One.
That's insane.
And when other,
the crazy thing is,

2084
01:51:24.871 --> 01:51:27.700
is one of the judges gave the second round of brow.
That's the same too.

2085
01:51:27.701 --> 01:51:28.540
I heard about that too.

2086
01:51:28.720 --> 01:51:33.130
But the knockdown that you fucked that guy's world up in that round,

2087
01:51:33.160 --> 01:51:36.730
that's as close to getting stopped did you can get and not get stopped and you

2088
01:51:36.731 --> 01:51:38.670
didn't get a ten eight well then the system's broke.

2089
01:51:38.680 --> 01:51:41.920
Your staff should be a tenant just like a when Danica steel or dropped Edson

2090
01:51:41.920 --> 01:51:45.080
Barboza and December in Sacramento.
That wasn't a ten eight ten nine well,

2091
01:51:45.250 --> 01:51:49.030
I support Muslim when a decision,
but that it would have been today.
Draw.
Draw.

2092
01:51:49.031 --> 01:51:51.850
Yeah.
He beat the fuck out of Edson Barboza in that first round.

2093
01:51:51.880 --> 01:51:55.450
I mean rocked in with that right hand and pounded on him for the whole round.

2094
01:51:55.451 --> 01:52:00.150
Yep.
How's that?
Not a ten eight they should,
it should have been tonight.

2095
01:52:00.490 --> 01:52:02.710
Yeah,
no doubt.
They need to do more.

2096
01:52:02.711 --> 01:52:04.990
Ten eight so that should have been it tonight for sure though.
Yeah.

2097
01:52:04.991 --> 01:52:08.770
I've had conversations with people about ten eight ten nine rounds and I just

2098
01:52:08.771 --> 01:52:09.281
don't get it.

2099
01:52:09.281 --> 01:52:11.950
Like somebody told me that the first round of Frankie Edgar and gray Maynard was

2100
01:52:11.951 --> 01:52:15.850
a ten nine round.
I go,
what the fuck are you talking about?

2101
01:52:15.940 --> 01:52:18.130
I think there's gray Maynard hit him with everything,

2102
01:52:18.131 --> 01:52:23.131
but the goddamn kitchen sink had him falling over backwards twice costs back in

2103
01:52:23.321 --> 01:52:25.360
one round.
I don't know what to do.
What they do,

2104
01:52:25.361 --> 01:52:27.700
they have meetings and they all get together and they say,
okay,

2105
01:52:27.701 --> 01:52:29.860
this is how you score it,
so we should look for us.
It goes on.

2106
01:52:29.861 --> 01:52:32.260
Are they just pulling people in an office,
an office cubicle?
I don't know.

2107
01:52:32.290 --> 01:52:36.220
I mean they have a new guy who's the director of the Athletic Commission now.

2108
01:52:36.221 --> 01:52:38.740
Let's see if they change things up at all to call me.

2109
01:52:38.770 --> 01:52:40.540
I'll change that shit up for Duane Ludwig.

2110
01:52:40.541 --> 01:52:45.040
Come in with the bank system at least for offers.
My guidance anyway,
that's,

2111
01:52:45.170 --> 01:52:46.150
I can do well.
Wheat

2112
01:52:46.370 --> 01:52:49.370
<v 0>for folks who don't know,
we stole a system from boxing.</v>

2113
01:52:49.400 --> 01:52:52.760
Boxing has a 10 point mustards and we just sort of adopted that system for

2114
01:52:52.761 --> 01:52:54.830
scoring,
but it's,

2115
01:52:54.860 --> 01:52:58.400
I don't think it's comprehensive enough for MMA because there's so many

2116
01:52:58.401 --> 01:53:01.910
different rules are so many different techniques rather than her in play and you

2117
01:53:01.911 --> 01:53:05.690
have to be subjective about what is more valuable.
In boxing,

2118
01:53:05.691 --> 01:53:09.950
a punch is a punch.
There is left hooks and jabs and right hands.

2119
01:53:09.951 --> 01:53:13.280
If a guy lands harder punches and more punches,
he's clearly winning,

2120
01:53:13.580 --> 01:53:17.480
but in MMA becomes subjective.
If a guy lands a hard punch,

2121
01:53:17.540 --> 01:53:21.380
but you take him down in almost guillotine him who won,

2122
01:53:21.560 --> 01:53:23.810
who won that exchange?
It's very tricky.

2123
01:53:24.110 --> 01:53:28.820
If a guy lands a good jab but the other guy fucks him up with a leg kick,

2124
01:53:28.850 --> 01:53:30.940
a lot of people won't count that leg kick.
Yeah,

2125
01:53:31.020 --> 01:53:32.690
they could count over that for sure.

2126
01:53:32.690 --> 01:53:34.820
It should get hit with each of them and then you'll be able to know.

2127
01:53:34.920 --> 01:53:38.630
That's the thing.
Some guys have said like there was a one judge,

2128
01:53:38.631 --> 01:53:39.680
I'll leave him nameless,

2129
01:53:39.710 --> 01:53:42.590
but he gets clowned around on all the time on the Internet,

2130
01:53:42.770 --> 01:53:46.550
but he said leg kicks don't end fights like,
are you fucking crazy?

2131
01:53:46.760 --> 01:53:49.760
Has No one ever leg kicked you?
That's the only way I can eat teach.

2132
01:53:49.860 --> 01:53:54.210
I TJ cry when my massage lady rubbed my it band and Zack,

2133
01:53:54.760 --> 01:53:57.690
this bitch goes into my it bands with her elbow and I'm ready to tie.

2134
01:53:59.040 --> 01:54:00.290
I mean the agony.

2135
01:54:00.510 --> 01:54:04.890
You think about a guy like Pat Barry slamming fucking Shinzen into that.

2136
01:54:05.060 --> 01:54:06.640
He stopped guys with leg cramps.

2137
01:54:07.520 --> 01:54:12.520
Edson Barboza stopped too fucking worldclass MMA fighters with with leg kicks.

2138
01:54:12.750 --> 01:54:17.570
Yeah.
Including hot fail all of era.
Who's a fucking longterm MMA fighter.

2139
01:54:17.571 --> 01:54:22.290
He's a real veteran.
Stopped him with leg kicks.
That's so dumb.
Oh yeah.

2140
01:54:22.340 --> 01:54:24.680
But those won't count as much as a punch.

2141
01:54:24.681 --> 01:54:27.350
Sometimes even a punch that doesn't even rock a guy.

2142
01:54:27.940 --> 01:54:30.710
He's just got to come back to people being martial arts and training in it and

2143
01:54:30.730 --> 01:54:33.590
understanding all the athletic commission.
People fight each other,

2144
01:54:34.400 --> 01:54:37.850
find out gloves and just as traveling,
one of those things,

2145
01:54:37.851 --> 01:54:40.330
you have to be able to speak the language to understand it,

2146
01:54:40.370 --> 01:54:42.860
and if you just know the words and what the words mean,

2147
01:54:42.861 --> 01:54:45.800
you're not gonna understand them in the context of the flow of the movement.

2148
01:54:46.250 --> 01:54:49.250
It's like if you taught me a bunch of words in Spanish and then a bunch of

2149
01:54:49.251 --> 01:54:50.120
people were talking,

2150
01:54:50.450 --> 01:54:53.030
I'm not necessarily going to get the gist of the conversation.

2151
01:54:53.240 --> 01:54:56.360
Even if I know what those words in Spanish are and go,
oh,
okay.
He said,

2152
01:54:56.361 --> 01:55:00.980
fuck your mother.
Your mother's a whore.
Pluto.
That's a whore.
You know?
Puta.
Okay,

2153
01:55:01.040 --> 01:55:03.680
I got it.
I know what he said.
That's essentially what's going on.

2154
01:55:03.681 --> 01:55:07.250
When you're seeing these guys and they're,
they're,
they're judging fights.

2155
01:55:07.450 --> 01:55:10.640
These guys,
they don't understand the flow.
They don't understand who's in danger.

2156
01:55:10.820 --> 01:55:14.840
The owner stand a transition.
They understand what's going on.
Like,
oh,

2157
01:55:14.841 --> 01:55:18.890
he's in a dominant spot now,
or no,
this guy's like super close to being finished.

2158
01:55:19.820 --> 01:55:23.510
<v 1>The problem I see with the Athletic Commission people training is if they</v>

2159
01:55:23.511 --> 01:55:26.190
trained somewhere that a guy's fighting from that gym,
you know,

2160
01:55:26.191 --> 01:55:29.840
so they can't train anywhere.
We're fighters train.
So they'd have to,
you know,

2161
01:55:29.900 --> 01:55:31.340
how do you do that?
How do you get them to train?

2162
01:55:31.341 --> 01:55:32.570
So it was a man academies though.

2163
01:55:32.571 --> 01:55:35.110
There's a man that kind of state athletic commission training centers or

2164
01:55:35.111 --> 01:55:39.650
something
or even even the way they still,

2165
01:55:39.651 --> 01:55:42.050
it's business,
you know,
it's just how it is.
Like you just,

2166
01:55:42.170 --> 01:55:43.830
you can't sway the either way.

2167
01:55:44.160 --> 01:55:46.860
<v 0>That'd be a professional.
But of course that would come into play.
I see that.</v>

2168
01:55:47.520 --> 01:55:50.190
Yeah.
There's no doubt.
I think,
um,
that could be an issue,

2169
01:55:50.191 --> 01:55:53.130
but guy should be examined and when something like that comes up,
they should be,

2170
01:55:53.490 --> 01:55:56.390
they should have a conversation with the class or experience.

2171
01:55:56.430 --> 01:55:58.140
When you see a really bad score card,

2172
01:55:58.141 --> 01:56:01.260
that guy should be forced to sit down and watch a fight and explain what he

2173
01:56:01.261 --> 01:56:03.360
thought.
What did he just,
you know,
like I've had,

2174
01:56:03.361 --> 01:56:06.390
I've had conversations with people that gave the first round GSP Hendricks.

2175
01:56:06.391 --> 01:56:09.640
They gave that first round of GSP.
I said,
let's watch that fight and you,

2176
01:56:09.650 --> 01:56:12.120
let's watch this around.
And you tell me how he won that first round.

2177
01:56:12.270 --> 01:56:16.060
Did he win it because he didn't come anywhere close to getting a gay teen?

2178
01:56:16.410 --> 01:56:18.570
Did he win it because there was a take down for a brief moment they were

2179
01:56:18.571 --> 01:56:20.940
scrambling on the ground or do you want to look at damage?

2180
01:56:21.090 --> 01:56:22.890
Look at the fact that he couldn't take the Hendricks down.

2181
01:56:22.891 --> 01:56:25.590
Hendrickson's pummeling them with left hands to the face in the clinch,

2182
01:56:25.740 --> 01:56:28.770
battering his legs with knees.
Like,
do you not see those?
Like,

2183
01:56:28.771 --> 01:56:32.700
what's going on here is no one ever need your leg.
And now,
uh,
the judges,

2184
01:56:32.701 --> 01:56:36.680
they don't watch the TV's right.
They watch too.
Sometimes we,

2185
01:56:36.720 --> 01:56:38.040
we had it set up in,

2186
01:56:38.041 --> 01:56:41.190
in Nevada and a lot of the fights where they're allowed to use,

2187
01:56:41.270 --> 01:56:44.330
I feel like they should.
Very important,
very important stuff.

2188
01:56:44.340 --> 01:56:46.770
You couldn't see if you weren't able to watch the TV wall commentating.

2189
01:56:46.800 --> 01:56:47.700
I miss it all the time.

2190
01:56:47.910 --> 01:56:51.900
I missed strikes if I try to watch it live as much as possible because I feel

2191
01:56:51.901 --> 01:56:56.430
like first of all it's the coolest shit ever fight live,
you know?

2192
01:56:56.431 --> 01:56:57.660
And it'd be ridiculous.

2193
01:56:57.661 --> 01:57:00.060
I have the greatest job in the world and I'm not even allowed to see it live.

2194
01:57:00.060 --> 01:57:02.820
I have to look at a little CV,
you know,
not even a big one,

2195
01:57:02.821 --> 01:57:05.250
a little one too fucking little ass TV right in front of you.

2196
01:57:05.490 --> 01:57:09.810
And when I'm watching it sometimes like there'll be a moment where like the guys

2197
01:57:09.811 --> 01:57:12.540
back is to me and he'll throw a punch in the guys in front of him and the guy

2198
01:57:12.541 --> 01:57:13.940
drops and you can't see what happened.

2199
01:57:14.250 --> 01:57:16.830
And so you have to watch it in the monitor and,
and check it.

2200
01:57:17.040 --> 01:57:20.640
But for a judge for the longest time they didn't have that.

2201
01:57:20.760 --> 01:57:23.400
So like say if a guy jumps,

2202
01:57:23.490 --> 01:57:27.700
jumps guard and is attacking a Komora and it's got a guy's arm locked up and

2203
01:57:27.701 --> 01:57:29.850
it's starting to pin it.
If you're looking from the wrong position,

2204
01:57:29.890 --> 01:57:31.410
you don't understand Jujitsu.
Say,

2205
01:57:31.411 --> 01:57:35.670
if you're on the other side and your the same level as the cage and you're all

2206
01:57:35.671 --> 01:57:36.990
the way on the other side of the cage,

2207
01:57:37.020 --> 01:57:39.120
you can't even see if that guy's arms getting jacked.

2208
01:57:39.500 --> 01:57:41.030
There's shit you're not going to catch up.

2209
01:57:41.190 --> 01:57:44.790
Like I've actually talked to judges who do train,

2210
01:57:44.820 --> 01:57:48.360
who told me that other judges have said to them in the middle of a fight,

2211
01:57:48.540 --> 01:57:52.710
what is he doing?
What is this?
What's going on here?
Which is fucking crazy.

2212
01:57:52.711 --> 01:57:56.490
It's crazy.
Highest level of the sport,
the highest level.

2213
01:57:56.640 --> 01:58:00.570
It's being judged by people who literally don't know what's happening,

2214
01:58:01.140 --> 01:58:02.460
which is crazy.
It goes,

2215
01:58:02.461 --> 01:58:05.190
it goes back to they need to train or do seminars and be accountable and even

2216
01:58:05.191 --> 01:58:07.590
the people that know are aren't using the points.

2217
01:58:07.680 --> 01:58:10.870
It's ten nine ten nine 10 everything's fucking ten nine yeah,

2218
01:58:11.310 --> 01:58:15.450
I mean you got to die in the cage to get a ten seven I mean,

2219
01:58:15.510 --> 01:58:19.920
what happens?
How does someone ever get a ten seven what happens?

2220
01:58:20.850 --> 01:58:23.820
What has to happen to be pretty to be a ten seven that could have been a 10

2221
01:58:23.870 --> 01:58:26.820
seller freaking I had to.
Great.
Great Maynard.
No question.
No question.

2222
01:58:26.821 --> 01:58:29.880
Should have been like that and there should have been a ten seven I don't,

2223
01:58:29.881 --> 01:58:32.250
I don't know the exact scoring by each and every judge,

2224
01:58:32.251 --> 01:58:36.500
but I had to say tonight I had a conversation.
10 is that crazy?
That's crazy.

2225
01:58:38.430 --> 01:58:42.280
I had a conversation with a judge who was arguing me that it was a 10,
nine.

2226
01:58:42.880 --> 01:58:45.820
He was actually arguing.
I was like,
this is,
and he's a judge.
I was like,

2227
01:58:45.821 --> 01:58:49.300
this is the craziest conversation I've ever heard.
I can't even talk to you.

2228
01:58:49.301 --> 01:58:51.900
You're a crazy person.
Like this is why it's,

2229
01:58:52.030 --> 01:58:54.490
it's got to be quantifiable because a guy can just squeak by.

2230
01:58:54.491 --> 01:58:58.330
There's oftentimes rounds where you go,
oh,
I'm going to give it to Ludwig.

2231
01:58:58.360 --> 01:59:02.170
It was so close and they'll do a 10,
nine Ludwig,
but it could have been a 10,

2232
01:59:02.171 --> 01:59:05.950
nine this guy too,
it's just like so close.
And then there's gray Maynard,

2233
01:59:05.951 --> 01:59:09.070
Frankie Edgar first fight,
you know,
which is like,
come on on those,

2234
01:59:09.071 --> 01:59:12.580
on those like really bad scoring.
Does she decisions,
uh,

2235
01:59:12.670 --> 01:59:16.110
when they like really mess up?
How has that person that lose their job?
Like it,

2236
01:59:16.320 --> 01:59:17.340
just like with any other gel,

2237
01:59:17.770 --> 01:59:20.680
if you're working at office Max and you mess up someone's giant printing

2238
01:59:20.681 --> 01:59:23.650
operation or whatever it is,
you're going to get fired.
Like,
why can't you,

2239
01:59:24.010 --> 01:59:26.290
why don't they get fired for making a horrible decision?

2240
01:59:26.320 --> 01:59:28.510
Part of the problem is that in order to get fired,

2241
01:59:28.511 --> 01:59:29.650
you have to admit you fucked up.

2242
01:59:29.920 --> 01:59:31.920
So you have to admit you hired someone who was incompetent.

2243
01:59:31.930 --> 01:59:33.340
So if you fired an incompetent person,

2244
01:59:33.341 --> 01:59:37.120
then they have to review that person's job and their employment record and go,

2245
01:59:37.330 --> 01:59:39.310
okay,
how long has this guy has been employed by you?

2246
01:59:39.311 --> 01:59:42.880
And let's look at some of their other fights that happened with the packing out

2247
01:59:42.881 --> 01:59:44.350
Timothy Bradley fight.
You know,

2248
01:59:45.100 --> 01:59:49.660
everybody was fucking so angry at this one judge that she resigned from being a

2249
01:59:49.661 --> 01:59:54.040
judge.
But then they started looking at her past and she has made some fucking

2250
01:59:54.041 --> 01:59:58.750
ridiculous calls.
We just really bad,
bad,
bad decisions.

2251
01:59:58.751 --> 02:00:01.480
And you're like,
what the fuck is going on here?
It's,

2252
02:00:01.720 --> 02:00:05.740
they don't want to admit that they hired in competent person and Kaiser was

2253
02:00:05.741 --> 02:00:08.500
fucking really,
really defensive about it.

2254
02:00:08.680 --> 02:00:11.530
Like I brought it up several times and they have terrible judging and he would,

2255
02:00:11.920 --> 02:00:12.760
instead of that,

2256
02:00:12.761 --> 02:00:16.780
he would like bring up fights where I thought a guy won and the consensus was

2257
02:00:16.781 --> 02:00:19.450
that the other guy won like online and on the underground or something like
that.

2258
02:00:19.660 --> 02:00:23.020
Didn't talk about it like in a,
in a very rational way.
Like,
well yeah,

2259
02:00:23.021 --> 02:00:26.530
well you do wrong some dorms to your opinions about right and now we're,

2260
02:00:26.531 --> 02:00:30.670
we're talking about like real obvious travesties of justice and he would be in

2261
02:00:30.671 --> 02:00:32.230
denial about the need for change.

2262
02:00:32.520 --> 02:00:35.710
Then you'd have to take into account people's gambling and maybe if they're

2263
02:00:35.711 --> 02:00:38.290
betting on the,
Ooh,
interesting.

2264
02:00:38.650 --> 02:00:41.010
Well that's what people were alleging and a,

2265
02:00:41.040 --> 02:00:45.580
an inquiring about when it came to this one particular boxing judge because some

2266
02:00:45.581 --> 02:00:48.280
of the decisions are so egregious that people were like,

2267
02:00:48.281 --> 02:00:51.770
what does cause there can be money made and with folks don't know.

2268
02:00:51.820 --> 02:00:54.340
There's a bunch of different options that you could bet on when you bet on a

2269
02:00:54.341 --> 02:00:56.860
fight.
They could be,
you could bet on over unders,

2270
02:00:57.010 --> 02:00:59.950
you can bet on unanimous decisions as opposed to majority of decisions.

2271
02:01:00.280 --> 02:01:04.780
If you could conceivably bribe someone to the point where they would make a bad

2272
02:01:04.781 --> 02:01:08.200
decision and that way the person would still win.

2273
02:01:08.260 --> 02:01:11.440
So it wouldn't be too much of an outrage like a manual packout dominating

2274
02:01:11.441 --> 02:01:15.250
Timothy Bradley still win,
but you give it to him,

2275
02:01:15.610 --> 02:01:16.600
you give one,

2276
02:01:16.601 --> 02:01:21.601
one guy gives it to to Bradley and this way this person gets a chunk of cash.

2277
02:01:22.360 --> 02:01:25.990
Manny Pacquiao is still wins the fight,
but then they,
you know,

2278
02:01:25.991 --> 02:01:28.570
when it comes down to like the bedding,
it's not a unanimous decision.

2279
02:01:28.571 --> 02:01:30.270
It's a split decision.
So some of bets,

2280
02:01:30.280 --> 02:01:32.860
a split decision they fucking clean up cause they bribed a judge.

2281
02:01:32.861 --> 02:01:34.600
I'm not saying that that's happened,

2282
02:01:34.780 --> 02:01:38.750
but that is one way you could do it for sure,

2283
02:01:38.860 --> 02:01:42.380
but you get a decision like that Pacquiao Bradley five were but Bradley beat

2284
02:01:42.381 --> 02:01:46.370
pack out and everybody was like,
what the fuck?
No Bradley didn't win that fight.

2285
02:01:46.371 --> 02:01:49.400
Like everybody was going crazy after that fight.
You watched that fight.

2286
02:01:49.850 --> 02:01:52.880
Manny Pacquiao outboxes Timothy Bradley.
It's a pretty clear,
yeah,
yeah,

2287
02:01:52.910 --> 02:01:54.530
100% so you ever go,

2288
02:01:54.590 --> 02:01:59.590
you always got to wonder how is it possible that 99% of boxing experts have one

2289
02:01:59.811 --> 02:02:00.530
opinion,

2290
02:02:00.530 --> 02:02:05.030
but yet people who are professional boxing judges fuck it up.

2291
02:02:05.600 --> 02:02:09.950
And with MMA,
I think it's up to interpretation,
unquestionably.
Right?
But in MMA,

2292
02:02:09.951 --> 02:02:11.870
I think it's a lot like with his Jack Slack fellows,

2293
02:02:12.470 --> 02:02:14.870
there's guys like that out there that really know their shit.

2294
02:02:15.180 --> 02:02:19.220
Those are the guys that you'd be judging.
There's,
they shut to pass an Iq test.

2295
02:02:19.221 --> 02:02:21.300
Everything.
I mean that guy guaranteed macro check.

2296
02:02:21.650 --> 02:02:26.330
How many goddamn judges are there?
I mean the sh
three for fight,

2297
02:02:26.510 --> 02:02:29.840
but I mean how many of them total is there?
20 as the 30 boy.

2298
02:02:29.841 --> 02:02:34.730
If you had like an like a big conference and brought in super fans from all over

2299
02:02:34.731 --> 02:02:37.460
the world,
figured out who was,
who knows their shit,

2300
02:02:37.461 --> 02:02:38.480
let's make them watch a fight.

2301
02:02:38.481 --> 02:02:42.230
You'd tell me what's going on in this fight and really an extensive,
you know,

2302
02:02:42.231 --> 02:02:45.350
a really exhaustive process.
You could have an amazing,

2303
02:02:45.860 --> 02:02:48.320
<v 6>I got my buddy Mike Temple who watches it,</v>

2304
02:02:48.321 --> 02:02:51.010
the fights of the guys that does a breakdown for me or does it bring it up for

2305
02:02:51.011 --> 02:02:53.740
them as well?
It breaks down.
Tj Is,
you know,
strengths,
weaknesses,

2306
02:02:53.741 --> 02:02:54.610
and then also breaks down.

2307
02:02:54.611 --> 02:02:57.280
They pull on the strengths and weaknesses and how we can do to capitalize on

2308
02:02:57.281 --> 02:02:58.090
these things.

2309
02:02:58.090 --> 02:03:01.660
So I get looks from other people as well as my buddy's a superfan and he'd be an

2310
02:03:01.661 --> 02:03:04.090
excellent judge,
a referee,
maybe.
I refute the judge for sure.

2311
02:03:04.150 --> 02:03:06.280
<v 0>I think there would be a lot,
a lot of guys like that.</v>

2312
02:03:06.281 --> 02:03:07.360
There's a lot of guys like that,

2313
02:03:07.410 --> 02:03:08.290
<v 6>so that's me,
man.</v>

2314
02:03:08.360 --> 02:03:10.910
I love breaking film down in just figuring out ways to do things,
you know?

2315
02:03:10.911 --> 02:03:11.740
That's fun.

2316
02:03:11.740 --> 02:03:12.520
<v 0>Yeah,
no doubt.</v>

2317
02:03:12.520 --> 02:03:16.810
But the thing with you though is that you'd have to watch the fight sober and

2318
02:03:16.811 --> 02:03:21.811
you'd have to watch the white stone freeways and on Alpha Brain Alpha brain.

2319
02:03:23.370 --> 02:03:26.650
When,
when you watch a fight,
what are you,
what are you looking for?

2320
02:03:26.651 --> 02:03:30.460
Are you looking for specific moments in the fight where you see vulnerability or

2321
02:03:30.461 --> 02:03:34.360
do you look at it one way,
the first pass and the second time?

2322
02:03:34.361 --> 02:03:38.260
Do you look at it more in detail?
Like one time look at offensively,
one time,

2323
02:03:39.600 --> 02:03:42.180
<v 6>offensively,
defensively what they're doing,
which were their step.</v>

2324
02:03:42.220 --> 02:03:44.760
And we're sort of course we didn't want to strikes how they react to certain

2325
02:03:44.761 --> 02:03:47.090
combinations,
where they do with the idiosyncrasies,
where they're doing with it,

2326
02:03:47.100 --> 02:03:50.910
when they're tired,
when they have their wings,
when they're feeling confident.
Um,

2327
02:03:51.030 --> 02:03:52.830
there's plenty of ways to look at it,
look at the fight.

2328
02:03:52.831 --> 02:03:56.640
But I always look at it with my guys winning and where the holes are going to
be.

2329
02:03:56.641 --> 02:04:00.270
Like if a guy is good,
let's say if you guys are good at left Tuck,

2330
02:04:00.450 --> 02:04:03.840
I want to do something to make them feel the left took Etsu perfect analogy.

2331
02:04:03.841 --> 02:04:06.720
I went down hard.
He dropped me a left hook,
right?
But,
uh,
um,

2332
02:04:06.810 --> 02:04:09.120
I tried to pick up their strengths and then make them do a strengths.

2333
02:04:09.130 --> 02:04:12.090
Hannah morale spin kick,
right?
He's really good at it.
Well let's make them do it.

2334
02:04:12.090 --> 02:04:14.110
So we already know we are expect or making them do a snow.

2335
02:04:14.111 --> 02:04:15.870
We're actually one step ahead,
things like that.

2336
02:04:15.871 --> 02:04:17.720
But as far as bringing down the fight itself,
there's,

2337
02:04:17.721 --> 02:04:19.450
there's plenty of things you could pick up on Washington by that.

2338
02:04:19.500 --> 02:04:22.230
There's the guy,
oh,
he was,
he was supposed to fight holds with first,

2339
02:04:22.231 --> 02:04:25.650
but it can switch to Chico was something big with him is in the middle of the

2340
02:04:25.651 --> 02:04:27.840
third round and every fight,
if it's a subconscious thing or not,

2341
02:04:27.870 --> 02:04:30.800
he breaks mentally.
He brings in the middle of the segment has been the,

2342
02:04:31.880 --> 02:04:34.750
I forgot the guy's name is a Korean or Chinese guy.
He was waiting,

2343
02:04:34.751 --> 02:04:39.540
he supposed to fight Holdsworth chicken came in.
Dude,
I forgot his name either.

2344
02:04:39.660 --> 02:04:41.160
Yeah,
I forgot his name.
But anyway,

2345
02:04:42.460 --> 02:04:45.630
he fought Chico Chico come loose in Milwaukee.
But uh,

2346
02:04:45.660 --> 02:04:49.080
he didn't with take downs his,
uh,
in the middle of each fight,

2347
02:04:49.110 --> 02:04:51.810
in the middle of the dead,
middle of each fight,
he physically broke.

2348
02:04:52.110 --> 02:04:54.210
I don't know if was mentally and physically.
So it's just things like that is,

2349
02:04:54.540 --> 02:04:55.410
you know the guy,

2350
02:04:55.650 --> 02:04:58.890
the guy who we can capitalize on him dropping his jab but come over the top of

2351
02:04:58.891 --> 02:05:02.010
the right hand or who couldn't,
you know him.
Yeah.

2352
02:05:02.570 --> 02:05:05.370
There's don't seem to see that people do,
whether they're aware of it or not.

2353
02:05:05.700 --> 02:05:08.550
Do you think sometimes people see the finish line and they start to slack off?

2354
02:05:09.540 --> 02:05:13.170
You mean like Tj didn't do like teacher,
I didn't do it.
All the gas

2355
02:05:15.120 --> 02:05:18.360
downshift and he wanted me to come

2356
02:05:18.570 --> 02:05:20.880
<v 3>fifth round,
obviously moved my feet faint and be safe.</v>

2357
02:05:20.881 --> 02:05:24.600
Obviously I hadn't tried to fight one and for me what I did and that fifth round

2358
02:05:24.601 --> 02:05:27.930
was slow for me.
I came out I think 30 45 seconds I didn't engage,

2359
02:05:28.230 --> 02:05:31.910
but as soon as he started coming at me,
it's like I can't,
I can't do it.
I mean,

2360
02:05:31.920 --> 02:05:35.010
if I'm going to be my best fighter I got to do,
I don't want to relax too much.

2361
02:05:35.011 --> 02:05:36.270
I don't want to be like,
all right,

2362
02:05:36.271 --> 02:05:39.030
I one kind of chill defense mode because you're going to get caught.

2363
02:05:39.031 --> 02:05:40.980
You're going to get beat because you're not at your best.
I want to write,

2364
02:05:41.280 --> 02:05:43.710
I need to do what I do best.
And that's how I and I get caught.

2365
02:05:44.230 --> 02:05:47.660
<v 0>That's a,
that's a very important point.
Pull up that fight.
Brion pull up the,</v>

2366
02:05:47.661 --> 02:05:52.660
the final sequence where Tj a knocks out Barao cause you,

2367
02:05:52.900 --> 02:05:56.260
you didn't do anything differently than you had done from the first round.

2368
02:05:56.261 --> 02:05:59.820
You just use,
every time you saw an opening,
you just kept attacking Kevin.
Dang.

2369
02:05:59.900 --> 02:06:02.470
So you stayed sharp.
That's an important thing to not,

2370
02:06:02.710 --> 02:06:04.810
not slack off when you see that finish line.

2371
02:06:04.811 --> 02:06:07.540
So people have a tendency to do that,
right?
They see the finish line,

2372
02:06:07.541 --> 02:06:09.700
they start thinking instead of fighting it

2373
02:06:09.840 --> 02:06:13.750
<v 3>defense mode,
I feel like,
so Danny Castillo do this against Barbosa.</v>

2374
02:06:13.780 --> 02:06:15.610
He went out there and demolished him the first shot.

2375
02:06:15.880 --> 02:06:16.900
And then the first thing I was,

2376
02:06:16.901 --> 02:06:20.620
was scared because I knew Danny was going to sit on a lead and I was afraid of

2377
02:06:20.621 --> 02:06:25.000
that.
And,
uh,
obviously Danny knows that now and he's,
you know,
he's aware of it,

2378
02:06:25.001 --> 02:06:28.570
but he,
that's what he did.
He went into defense mode he wanted,
and he was like,

2379
02:06:28.571 --> 02:06:30.790
all right,
I got this fight.
Just be safe,
you know,

2380
02:06:31.090 --> 02:06:33.340
and that hinders your performance.
Then he lit every time.

2381
02:06:33.380 --> 02:06:36.640
But at some of us have landed to kick is his conference meeting,
went back up.

2382
02:06:36.910 --> 02:06:37.601
He had him broke.

2383
02:06:37.601 --> 02:06:39.670
If you were to count there in the second round and did the exact same thing in

2384
02:06:39.671 --> 02:06:41.050
the first round,
the fire would have been over.

2385
02:06:41.051 --> 02:06:41.980
He would have finished in that round.

2386
02:06:42.190 --> 02:06:43.930
But instead he lets him come back in the fight,

2387
02:06:43.931 --> 02:06:46.150
let them land a couple spin kicks and lend some leg kicks.

2388
02:06:46.340 --> 02:06:49.340
Cars has confidence back in the fight changed,
you know?
Yeah,

2389
02:06:50.080 --> 02:06:53.920
<v 0>yeah.
That's interesting,
isn't it?
It's when you watch that first round two,</v>

2390
02:06:53.921 --> 02:06:56.350
that was sort of a harbinger of things to come.

2391
02:06:56.530 --> 02:07:00.280
And then you saw Danny and his last fight who,
who was,
who did he fight?

2392
02:07:00.281 --> 02:07:03.730
He knocked out with one part of the grid and then Jack,
God damn,

2393
02:07:03.731 --> 02:07:07.210
that right hand he hit Brennaman with Holy Shit.
Was that impressive?
Awesome.

2394
02:07:07.450 --> 02:07:09.130
Perfect timing.
Perfect.

2395
02:07:09.240 --> 02:07:13.590
Just we'll just close the distance perfectly and just landed like with

2396
02:07:13.600 --> 02:07:15.340
everything from the toes

2397
02:07:17.950 --> 02:07:20.720
and you could see how happy was man.
He was so happy.

2398
02:07:20.780 --> 02:07:22.990
<v 6>What was cool is he didn't follow up with that and that and that's like all</v>

2399
02:07:23.010 --> 02:07:24.080
right man.
And when he was already out,

2400
02:07:24.081 --> 02:07:27.020
so that was definitely cool to see the heels out in and pull that last punch.

2401
02:07:27.050 --> 02:07:27.810
So didn't hit.

2402
02:07:27.810 --> 02:07:31.080
<v 0>That was very cool.
And you could see by the impact,
like here's the,</v>

2403
02:07:31.081 --> 02:07:34.410
here's the final combination.
Dude.
That's just you.

2404
02:07:34.470 --> 02:07:38.380
You fucking stepping over to the left away from the shot.
Look at this.

2405
02:07:39.460 --> 02:07:41.500
<v 3>I love how I bounced off.
I've watched it a couple of times now.</v>

2406
02:07:41.501 --> 02:07:44.170
I bounced off the cage.
Yeah,
you shoulda checked the cable.

2407
02:07:44.200 --> 02:07:45.430
The hardest overhand left.

2408
02:07:45.490 --> 02:07:48.310
I didn't even know I can throw it over and lift that hard dude.
That was solid.

2409
02:07:48.311 --> 02:07:50.650
Yeah.
What a combination.
Slipping,
coming back.

2410
02:07:50.780 --> 02:07:54.160
I like going back and watching the tape and finally remembering stuff you did.

2411
02:07:54.220 --> 02:07:56.500
<v 0>Is it hard like to,
I mean,</v>

2412
02:07:57.610 --> 02:07:59.620
I don't know if this makes any sense at all,

2413
02:07:59.740 --> 02:08:03.400
but is it hard to live in the moment after something like this or you like in

2414
02:08:03.401 --> 02:08:04.360
the middle of the train and going,

2415
02:08:04.840 --> 02:08:09.280
holy fucking shit that I really knock out Borow like are you like when you're

2416
02:08:09.281 --> 02:08:10.660
training,
when you're hitting the pads,

2417
02:08:10.661 --> 02:08:15.640
when you move from like am I really the fucking barely I champion Tj Dillashaw

2418
02:08:16.350 --> 02:08:18.860
<v 3>takes a while to get,
I mean,
it's still kicking in,
you know what I mean?</v>

2419
02:08:18.861 --> 02:08:23.840
It's only been,
what,
nine days?
It's,
it's crazy dude.
It's a crazy ride.

2420
02:08:24.680 --> 02:08:26.720
I mean it hasn't even,
I don't even think it's fully kicked in yet.

2421
02:08:26.721 --> 02:08:29.660
You know what I just did,
you know what I mean?

2422
02:08:29.661 --> 02:08:32.990
Everyone was obviously counting me out except for my team and myself.

2423
02:08:32.991 --> 02:08:35.840
And so to make that kind of statement,
it's still kind of,

2424
02:08:35.841 --> 02:08:39.800
I mean to hear you say what you say and to watch it again on,
on the,
um,

2425
02:08:39.830 --> 02:08:41.180
the fights and just kind of like,

2426
02:08:41.610 --> 02:08:45.690
<v 0>Holy Shit.
Well,
what's interesting to me is not just what you did,</v>

2427
02:08:45.960 --> 02:08:49.650
it's how quick you improved from your time in the ultimate fighter and how much

2428
02:08:49.651 --> 02:08:52.110
potential you have.
And how interesting.

2429
02:08:52.111 --> 02:08:56.640
This is what Dwayne said is so true that we're at a really unique time in the

2430
02:08:56.641 --> 02:09:00.960
evolution of mixed martial arts and we're seeing these Jon Jones characters are

2431
02:09:00.961 --> 02:09:05.370
taking things to this totally new place where you know,
you've seen creativity,

2432
02:09:05.371 --> 02:09:09.630
this abundance of different techniques that they have available to them inside

2433
02:09:09.631 --> 02:09:13.590
the octagon and you're seeing accelerations in every single place.

2434
02:09:13.591 --> 02:09:16.860
Whether it's Jujitsu,
you're seeing accelerations in the striking,

2435
02:09:17.100 --> 02:09:19.830
you seeing everything is starting to pick up,
you know.

2436
02:09:19.831 --> 02:09:24.270
And that to me was a milestone fight because it was like so tactical and it was

2437
02:09:24.271 --> 02:09:26.190
such an obvious,

2438
02:09:27.270 --> 02:09:31.120
an obvious influence of like you as a trainer,
there was,
it was,
it was,

2439
02:09:31.140 --> 02:09:33.570
you could see it in the fight,
you can see it in the movement.

2440
02:09:33.720 --> 02:09:37.770
Like I know you have this very unique way of teaching punches in combination

2441
02:09:37.771 --> 02:09:40.470
with footsteps and movement.
So,
and I was watching this,

2442
02:09:40.620 --> 02:09:43.080
having seen you hit the pads and having,
you know,

2443
02:09:43.290 --> 02:09:48.120
having seen you coach with that and watching it take place.
Oh,
it was amazing

2444
02:09:49.770 --> 02:09:51.630
having that conversation that we had at lunch,

2445
02:09:51.631 --> 02:09:55.530
before the fight and then watching what you said take place.
You know,

2446
02:09:55.531 --> 02:09:58.740
I remember thinking,
man,
wow,
this is so bizarre.

2447
02:09:58.741 --> 02:10:01.890
Almost as if you could predict the future right out.
Well,

2448
02:10:01.920 --> 02:10:03.960
if you do your homework and you do it right,

2449
02:10:04.230 --> 02:10:08.520
it's like if you had to do,
you know,
Jujitsu with a,

2450
02:10:08.530 --> 02:10:12.090
a white belt who didn't work out and say,
well,
here's what's going to happen.

2451
02:10:12.120 --> 02:10:14.810
I'm going to grab him a clinch.
I'm about to take him to the ground.
Uh,

2452
02:10:14.820 --> 02:10:16.950
I'm a arm triangle.
You know,
what's he gonna do?

2453
02:10:16.950 --> 02:10:18.810
He doesn't know what the fuck you going to do.
And he's gay.
He's not,

2454
02:10:18.811 --> 02:10:23.700
he doesn't know.
He can't.
But at a certain level to say that it gets crazy.
Yeah.

2455
02:10:23.780 --> 02:10:27.360
Like when someone has no idea what you're going to do and your,
you know,

2456
02:10:27.361 --> 02:10:30.900
a Jocko Ra Sousa,
you could kind of do whatever you want to them.

2457
02:10:31.230 --> 02:10:36.050
But it's when the guy's hen and Borow and you say,
well,
was going to do,

2458
02:10:36.051 --> 02:10:39.090
is going to fall for faints and the teacher's going to be constantly stepping to

2459
02:10:39.091 --> 02:10:43.450
move into,
you know,
once that happens,
then it's really crazy.

2460
02:10:44.450 --> 02:10:47.210
Then you watch it and it's,
it's so it's like,
okay,
Yep.

2461
02:10:47.240 --> 02:10:51.320
This is the next evolutionary step drilled.
I guarantee you,
you know,
look,

2462
02:10:51.321 --> 02:10:54.400
Barao was going to come back.
Better fucking for sure.

2463
02:10:54.590 --> 02:10:57.590
Fucking for sure they're going to watch that fight.
You know,
they're gonna,

2464
02:10:57.620 --> 02:11:00.410
they're gonna see what they did wrong and browse going to come back and he's

2465
02:11:00.411 --> 02:11:04.070
going to light somebody else on fire and demand a rematch and it's going to be

2466
02:11:04.071 --> 02:11:06.600
crazy down the line.
Awesome.
That's how it always is,
right.

2467
02:11:06.740 --> 02:11:10.810
<v 3>I had the sports,
so good man.
I mean,
that's why it's,
uh,
it's nerve wrecking.</v>

2468
02:11:10.811 --> 02:11:11.501
It's exciting.

2469
02:11:11.501 --> 02:11:14.020
It's like everyone's getting better all at the same time because I beat him.

2470
02:11:14.021 --> 02:11:16.630
He's going to give him better than you already was,
which is hard to believe,

2471
02:11:16.631 --> 02:11:17.464
you know?

2472
02:11:18.670 --> 02:11:21.790
<v 0>Yeah.
They need each other,
you know,
let her needed Duran.
Lennar needed.</v>

2473
02:11:21.800 --> 02:11:25.640
Tommy Hearns.
Holly needed Frasier.
Yeah.
Everybody needs that rival.

2474
02:11:26.180 --> 02:11:29.150
That's part of not happening.
You also have it in the gym as well,

2475
02:11:29.151 --> 02:11:33.140
which is that credible?
I don't think boxing had that that much.
You know,

2476
02:11:33.170 --> 02:11:36.260
I think boxing's not as much of a team sport.
It's more individual.

2477
02:11:36.320 --> 02:11:39.160
It's cause wrestlers got involved.
Yeah,
it is.
Right.

2478
02:11:40.360 --> 02:11:41.630
<v 3>We turned ours into a wrestling team.</v>

2479
02:11:41.631 --> 02:11:45.890
We seriously just have a wrestling team at our gym and I feel like the exact

2480
02:11:45.891 --> 02:11:47.120
same feelings when I was in college.

2481
02:11:47.240 --> 02:11:49.310
That's interesting because if you remember right,

2482
02:11:49.360 --> 02:11:52.150
<v 0>like when like Marvin Hagler was the champ,</v>

2483
02:11:52.370 --> 02:11:55.120
you never really heard a lot about Hagler sparring partners.

2484
02:11:55.150 --> 02:11:58.660
You know like Hagler comes from a team of animals and you know,

2485
02:11:58.930 --> 02:12:03.220
in this area of Massachusetts and they all get together and Brockton,

2486
02:12:03.221 --> 02:12:04.031
blockbuster,

2487
02:12:04.031 --> 02:12:08.080
they all can fire up and live together in a house and get the fuck Outta here.

2488
02:12:08.090 --> 02:12:12.130
There's none of that in boxing.
Very rarely do you have that in boxing.
You know,

2489
02:12:12.131 --> 02:12:14.930
you have camps like Robert Garcia's camp.
They're pretty tight,
you know,

2490
02:12:14.931 --> 02:12:17.750
pretty roaches camp.
They're pretty tight starting now.
Maybe they,

2491
02:12:17.850 --> 02:12:19.150
they see the benefit of it.

2492
02:12:19.800 --> 02:12:21.960
<v 3>What other martial arts,
uh,</v>

2493
02:12:22.510 --> 02:12:25.080
is their teams the time when we tie team?

2494
02:12:25.160 --> 02:12:27.770
<v 0>Yeah.
Moy,
Tai,
you know,
if you fight for a certain gym,</v>

2495
02:12:27.771 --> 02:12:30.830
like if you're on Mike's gym guy,
those guys all come out to the cage together.

2496
02:12:30.831 --> 02:12:31.900
Golden Glory guys.
Yeah.

2497
02:12:32.060 --> 02:12:35.030
<v 3>Do they actually do like a duel?
I mean,
I know there's like IFC,
we had those,</v>

2498
02:12:35.110 --> 02:12:37.220
those kickboxing matches and you keep score and everything,

2499
02:12:37.221 --> 02:12:41.000
but is there like a dual match like this team versus team and you keep the score

2500
02:12:41.001 --> 02:12:43.910
for matches?
A good question.
Can we as a team,

2501
02:12:43.911 --> 02:12:45.950
like you can win a national championship as a team.

2502
02:12:46.210 --> 02:12:48.460
<v 0>They'd done that.
He started that mirror.
Chuck Norris had that world yet.</v>

2503
02:12:48.470 --> 02:12:51.520
Boxing League or something like that.
But that's where Raymond Daniels emerged.

2504
02:12:51.550 --> 02:12:52.860
That's right.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

2505
02:12:52.870 --> 02:12:56.460
That's where people first got to see that guy that won that fight with that

2506
02:12:56.470 --> 02:12:58.690
crazy jumping,
spinning kick.
Yeah.

2507
02:12:58.691 --> 02:13:03.580
Chuck had a cool idea for it to those the maths with no ropes,
you know?

2508
02:13:03.640 --> 02:13:07.630
Oh yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Sort of like a dish from almost butts round.

2509
02:13:08.560 --> 02:13:11.770
Frank shamrock did that for a while too.
Do you remember?
Oh,
he had a shoe.

2510
02:13:11.820 --> 02:13:16.620
Oh yeah,
it was it shoe box or something along those lines.
Yeah,

2511
02:13:17.380 --> 02:13:21.910
he had like a,
like a pit and I don't look at and then,
um,
yama pit.

2512
02:13:21.940 --> 02:13:25.750
They tried to do that.
I remember,
I know the uh,

2513
02:13:25.751 --> 02:13:30.740
the original founders of,
uh,
the,
the UFC like Bob Myerwitz.
Okay.

2514
02:13:30.741 --> 02:13:32.070
Tried come back with some

2515
02:13:32.070 --> 02:13:36.860
<v 7>new thing,
some yama pitch thing.
Yeah.
It was a couple of years back.
Okay.
Like,
um,</v>

2516
02:13:37.320 --> 02:13:41.220
some,
some good guys Fonda in it,
you know,
it was like,
um,

2517
02:13:41.880 --> 02:13:44.400
I don't know if Pat Smith,
I want to say Pat Smith,
Florida.

2518
02:13:44.750 --> 02:13:47.160
There was some guys that were like good fighters.
It just,

2519
02:13:47.190 --> 02:13:51.850
just below like UFC level.
Oh,
just seen this.
This is fucking team.

2520
02:13:52.680 --> 02:13:57.300
This is not,
to me,
this is a case is a fight.
I don't like this.
It's dangerous.

2521
02:13:57.301 --> 02:14:02.130
Guys are stomping out or what?
What happened?
Well,
they fight.
Yeah,

2522
02:14:02.131 --> 02:14:04.540
you tap out or he get submitted.
But this isn't marsh.

2523
02:14:04.830 --> 02:14:07.920
It's crazy because guys come over and soccer kicked guys in their head,

2524
02:14:07.921 --> 02:14:10.620
whether in a headlock with another dude like these champions are beating on this

2525
02:14:10.621 --> 02:14:15.270
guy.
Look at this.
Three guys,
three guys came over and stomped this guy.

2526
02:14:15.390 --> 02:14:16.380
Where's this done at?

2527
02:14:16.830 --> 02:14:20.580
Brusher it gives zero fucks in Russia and these guys would get beat up.

2528
02:14:20.580 --> 02:14:24.360
They get beat up fucking bad.
It's one thing to get beat up by one dude,

2529
02:14:24.361 --> 02:14:28.470
but three dudes stomping you when you're on the ground.
Yeah.

2530
02:14:28.950 --> 02:14:30.750
That's why I feel as lost in today,

2531
02:14:30.751 --> 02:14:33.510
especially in mixed martial arts as the traditional martial arts honor,
respect.

2532
02:14:33.750 --> 02:14:37.280
I think that's something that I helped bring to the camp and then,

2533
02:14:37.310 --> 02:14:40.140
and it's just kind of a thing.
It helps people keep willing,
accountable,
you know,

2534
02:14:40.141 --> 02:14:43.770
shut up no more.
That's about enough to my watch.
That shit.
It's not,

2535
02:14:43.800 --> 02:14:46.710
it's not an MMA,
it's an assault.

2536
02:14:47.010 --> 02:14:51.630
I agree with you and those guys should be arrested.
I mean,

2537
02:14:51.631 --> 02:14:53.860
the whole idea of of MMA is,
you know,

2538
02:14:53.910 --> 02:14:58.590
one guy against another guy trying to establish who's trained the harvest,

2539
02:14:58.591 --> 02:15:01.710
who's got the best set of skills when another guy's kicking your head and you're

2540
02:15:01.711 --> 02:15:04.680
holding on the guys head locked.
What?
What does that prove?

2541
02:15:05.430 --> 02:15:08.330
That's assault proves that someone made us a silly show.

2542
02:15:08.331 --> 02:15:10.800
They showed two guys can knock the fuck out of one guy.
Yeah,

2543
02:15:10.801 --> 02:15:15.180
we can own that for a long time.
That fighting shouldn't be a team sport.

2544
02:15:15.181 --> 02:15:18.000
Like that sort of proves if you got to do something like that and she'd be one

2545
02:15:18.001 --> 02:15:22.770
guy versus two guys,
I'll be down for that.
If you got one bad motherfucker.

2546
02:15:23.190 --> 02:15:27.420
He like one Badr Hari and to you know,
fat soccer players

2547
02:15:29.250 --> 02:15:31.900
like to pay to see that for sure.

2548
02:15:31.920 --> 02:15:36.150
You guys don't have MMA training but think they could pull it off,
you know,

2549
02:15:36.151 --> 02:15:39.100
and one MMA fighter.
Yeah.
I need

2550
02:15:39.100 --> 02:15:41.340
<v 3>three.
He might need at least three guys to make that even competitive.</v>

2551
02:15:41.370 --> 02:15:46.370
They don't know any MMA and all that mad fucking bum rush of athletic dudes.

2552
02:15:47.980 --> 02:15:51.900
That would be,
that would be profit.
Reminds me of my dad when we were younger.

2553
02:15:51.920 --> 02:15:55.910
My older brother,
he'd always have his friends come over and my dad's just,

2554
02:15:55.911 --> 02:15:58.750
this old wrestler is super strong and he would just,
uh,

2555
02:15:59.110 --> 02:16:01.810
take them all on and have them all pin on the floor at the same time.

2556
02:16:01.811 --> 02:16:04.190
And it was screwing it up because they have no idea how to wrestle.

2557
02:16:04.200 --> 02:16:05.980
And my older brother and his friends never wrestled.

2558
02:16:05.981 --> 02:16:08.380
So it's just like he can hold them all down and manipulate them.

2559
02:16:08.381 --> 02:16:11.560
These are grown men and stuff too.
It's hilarious to see,
you know,
so that's,

2560
02:16:11.561 --> 02:16:11.801
I mean,

2561
02:16:11.801 --> 02:16:14.680
they would need more than three guys to do that to some of the really well

2562
02:16:14.681 --> 02:16:18.460
trained,
you know.
Do you teach your old man choke holds?
I mean,
he,
he uh,

2563
02:16:18.490 --> 02:16:23.170
he loves the sport man are awesome.
They love it.
They got into a big time.

2564
02:16:23.200 --> 02:16:26.200
Um,
my dad's the one that's made me who I am,
you know,

2565
02:16:26.201 --> 02:16:29.830
he's the one that made me so great.
My mom,
me,
super competitive and,
uh,

2566
02:16:30.980 --> 02:16:33.310
<v 1>my dad comes to the gym,
try to tell Dwayne how to do his job,</v>

2567
02:16:33.311 --> 02:16:37.360
what I should be doing.
You know,
joking.
No,
he's joking around.
He's just,
uh,

2568
02:16:37.660 --> 02:16:41.650
having fun with it.
Relationship this period he would,

2569
02:16:41.651 --> 02:16:42.960
his present boss relationship,
you know,

2570
02:16:42.961 --> 02:16:45.480
you always hear about these fighters that grew up with uh,
you know,

2571
02:16:45.490 --> 02:16:47.710
really bad families or a hard upbringing and stuff.

2572
02:16:47.711 --> 02:16:50.380
And I've always thought about like,
Dan,
I don't,
I mean live.
Luckily,

2573
02:16:50.381 --> 02:16:53.620
luckily I never had any of that stuff and it's crazy that I've wanted to do,

2574
02:16:53.860 --> 02:16:57.340
I kind of got into this and it seems like most,
most of the fighters have,

2575
02:16:57.670 --> 02:16:59.290
you know,
bad backgrounds for the most part.

2576
02:16:59.291 --> 02:17:01.030
Do you know that background can help you,

2577
02:17:01.031 --> 02:17:04.060
but it can also could fuck you up like a chip on your shoulder if,

2578
02:17:04.061 --> 02:17:07.420
what if you having a bad background because you have a camp ground,

2579
02:17:07.421 --> 02:17:11.230
your super balanced.
Sorry.
No,
please.
I think it's someone's,

2580
02:17:11.231 --> 02:17:13.240
a vision of how they look at it.
You know,

2581
02:17:13.270 --> 02:17:16.060
if you want to look at the fire to heat the house were to burn the house down,

2582
02:17:16.061 --> 02:17:18.250
how are you gonna look at that to positively and negatively motivate you.

2583
02:17:19.360 --> 02:17:23.650
But I think also everyone's experiences are unique in the amount of trauma they

2584
02:17:23.651 --> 02:17:27.980
experienced.
You know,
the amount of abuse they experienced.
It's not uniform.
Yeah.

2585
02:17:28.820 --> 02:17:30.430
It's,
you know,
it's hard to tell.

2586
02:17:30.431 --> 02:17:33.990
Some guys have gotten out of bad situations that become incredibly motivated and

2587
02:17:34.120 --> 02:17:37.090
super dangerous.
And then there's those Tj Dillashaw mother fuckers.

2588
02:17:37.290 --> 02:17:38.830
Just like what,

2589
02:17:38.860 --> 02:17:43.060
what do you think it is about you that led you to want to be an MMA fighter?

2590
02:17:43.061 --> 02:17:46.600
If you ever sat down and thought it out?
What made you so aggressive?

2591
02:17:46.780 --> 02:17:50.860
My family for sure.
I have two other brothers.
I'm the middle child.
Um,

2592
02:17:50.920 --> 02:17:54.500
my family has always been s anything we do,
we turn into a competition.
I mean,

2593
02:17:54.630 --> 02:17:58.330
even even your mom.
Oh yeah.
When we were kids,
we'd be like moms.
I,

2594
02:17:58.430 --> 02:18:00.150
my dad and my mom would drive to an event.

2595
02:18:00.151 --> 02:18:04.390
We are some wrestling event or whatever to support her kids and we'd both be

2596
02:18:04.391 --> 02:18:06.910
there.
We'd pick a car to ride home in and then it'd be a race to get home.

2597
02:18:07.150 --> 02:18:10.150
Whoever's with mob wins when we get home or hoovers,
dad's mom,
you know,
we,

2598
02:18:10.151 --> 02:18:12.220
when we get home or just any kind of game,

2599
02:18:12.221 --> 02:18:14.590
anything we're doing at the house or on vacation,

2600
02:18:14.600 --> 02:18:18.100
we've always turned it into a competition and we get pissed when we lose to,

2601
02:18:18.101 --> 02:18:20.970
I mean even with family,
you know,
even my mom,
like yeah,

2602
02:18:20.990 --> 02:18:24.610
my mom like riding ATVs and getting all aggressive and she's this tiny little

2603
02:18:24.611 --> 02:18:28.390
woman and she's the most aggressive out of all of them and it's just kind of

2604
02:18:28.391 --> 02:18:32.140
bred me to compete.
And then I wrestled my whole life and I didn't,

2605
02:18:32.260 --> 02:18:33.760
I didn't do what I wanted to in wrestling.

2606
02:18:33.761 --> 02:18:37.820
I didn't achieve the goals I set myself to.
And so after I graduated,

2607
02:18:37.821 --> 02:18:39.370
I just feel like it wasn't done competing,
you know,

2608
02:18:39.371 --> 02:18:42.880
like I didn't reach the ultimate greatness.
I wasn't the best I could have been.

2609
02:18:42.940 --> 02:18:45.400
Always found that like with competitive athletics,

2610
02:18:45.430 --> 02:18:48.250
it's very difficult to do that while you're in college.

2611
02:18:48.300 --> 02:18:51.760
And I've always been really impressed by collegic athletes that were able to

2612
02:18:51.761 --> 02:18:55.030
maintain high grades and still competed a super high level.

2613
02:18:55.570 --> 02:18:59.140
And although it's super admirable,
it's not ideal.
No,
not at all.

2614
02:18:59.260 --> 02:19:03.940
So did you feel like there was also an opportunity once you got out of college,

2615
02:19:04.120 --> 02:19:04.571
you don't,

2616
02:19:04.571 --> 02:19:07.270
didn't have to constitute in your study so much and now you could fully reach

2617
02:19:07.271 --> 02:19:07.781
your potential?

2618
02:19:07.781 --> 02:19:11.020
And my studies was my competition and I didn't have to worry about anything
else,

2619
02:19:11.021 --> 02:19:14.640
but competing obviously make some money to be able to live.
But it was based for,

2620
02:19:14.830 --> 02:19:17.470
for my self to be able to fight.
Um,
yeah,

2621
02:19:17.471 --> 02:19:20.320
I mean going through school and then also just I,

2622
02:19:20.321 --> 02:19:22.420
I'm glad I learned how to pick myself.

2623
02:19:22.421 --> 02:19:24.220
I felt like I was peaked wrong and college for wrestling,

2624
02:19:24.221 --> 02:19:26.290
it was too much of a grind.
It was too long,
you know?

2625
02:19:26.291 --> 02:19:29.210
So I learned a lot through wrestling and which has helped me get to where I'm
at.

2626
02:19:29.330 --> 02:19:33.650
It's incredible that wrestling is so difficult that fucking UFC fighters the

2627
02:19:33.651 --> 02:19:37.460
highest level say,
man,
I'm glad I'm not wrestling 100% man.

2628
02:19:37.470 --> 02:19:41.270
Like all this stuff I do and practice the practice.

2629
02:19:41.271 --> 02:19:44.570
I do not want to go to his wrestling.
It's going to be the toughest.

2630
02:19:44.571 --> 02:19:46.880
You're going to be the most tired and you're going to be at the most beat up in

2631
02:19:46.881 --> 02:19:48.890
wrestling.
Yeah.
It's not the best way to do it,

2632
02:19:48.891 --> 02:19:52.090
but it's the best way to develop that in dominant bull mental strength.

2633
02:19:52.370 --> 02:19:55.760
I highly recommend getting involved in wrestling if you want to learn the

2634
02:19:55.761 --> 02:19:59.180
dedication of martial arts and just a hard work ethic and learning how to

2635
02:19:59.181 --> 02:20:00.140
compete.
The mental,

2636
02:20:00.200 --> 02:20:03.560
the mental preparation for wrestling is man is nothing else like it.

2637
02:20:04.070 --> 02:20:06.500
There's people that think they work hard in.
They're hilarious.

2638
02:20:06.501 --> 02:20:09.670
Those people are hilarious.
They really have no idea what hardware kids,

2639
02:20:09.710 --> 02:20:13.220
if you've,
I'm,
I'm not bullshitting.
Even if you'd done Jujitsu,

2640
02:20:13.250 --> 02:20:14.540
even if you've done kickboxing,

2641
02:20:14.840 --> 02:20:19.160
my one of the hardest times I've ever worked out was high school wrestling.

2642
02:20:19.180 --> 02:20:20.380
Once he's in a high school wrestling,

2643
02:20:20.660 --> 02:20:23.510
I remember we were doing shit where I was waking up in the morning and it would

2644
02:20:23.511 --> 02:20:27.500
hurt my legs to stand up and be like,
ah,

2645
02:20:27.501 --> 02:20:30.200
my legs were on fire and I'd be walking to the bedroom.

2646
02:20:30.201 --> 02:20:33.770
I was 16 or 15 or whatever the fuck I was.
I was like,
ah,

2647
02:20:33.771 --> 02:20:38.480
my fucking legs are killing me.
I'd be in class,
I'd be exhausted.

2648
02:20:38.481 --> 02:20:40.910
And then I knew looking at the clock,
oh motherfucker,

2649
02:20:41.270 --> 02:20:44.220
couple of hours from now we're going to go to war again.
Oh,

2650
02:20:44.740 --> 02:20:47.060
in college I'd be doing morning practice where they're doing strength

2651
02:20:47.061 --> 02:20:50.840
conditioning or runs like intense runs before classes before at six in the

2652
02:20:50.841 --> 02:20:52.760
morning and we're doing this.
And then we go to class.
You know,

2653
02:20:52.761 --> 02:20:55.790
you have two or three classes depending on your day of the week.

2654
02:20:56.030 --> 02:20:58.550
And then you have a two hour practices he's getting on with the classes,

2655
02:20:58.570 --> 02:21:01.910
you know?
Or he might have a night class after practice,
you know,
and homework.

2656
02:21:01.940 --> 02:21:04.730
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
And then homework,
you know,
so research,
homework,

2657
02:21:04.970 --> 02:21:07.730
fucking pile of books and shit.
It definitely does.

2658
02:21:07.910 --> 02:21:10.560
That's what these guys are so successful now.
But look at guys like harm.
Yay.

2659
02:21:10.610 --> 02:21:14.600
Look guys.
The cornea that,
those high level wrestlers,
not just his wrestling,

2660
02:21:14.601 --> 02:21:18.440
but that sort of focus and dedication that those guys have and that,

2661
02:21:18.530 --> 02:21:20.590
that knowledge of how to win,
how to compete.

2662
02:21:20.600 --> 02:21:24.830
Remember that Matt Lindland if he's the most,
the most technically sound guy,

2663
02:21:24.860 --> 02:21:28.310
but he knew how to fight.
He was a Gamer.
He knew how to compete.
Anything.

2664
02:21:28.700 --> 02:21:31.340
No doubt.
No doubt.
It's,
it's amazing when you,
uh,

2665
02:21:31.341 --> 02:21:35.670
you see how many great amateur wrestlers have gone on to be great MMA class.
Why?

2666
02:21:35.690 --> 02:21:39.060
It's so unfortunate to see these restaurant programs get cut too terrible.
Cal,

2667
02:21:39.170 --> 02:21:41.390
cal state,
Florida,
my rest of that,
it doesn't have wrestling team anymore.

2668
02:21:41.420 --> 02:21:45.770
We're trying to get it back.
But it's like to teach someone life skills.

2669
02:21:45.771 --> 02:21:47.370
Like wrestling is the best way to,

2670
02:21:47.390 --> 02:21:50.210
I mean one of the sports in general is the best way to do it and there's no way

2671
02:21:50.211 --> 02:21:54.110
she could wrestling.
It's communism,
terrorists and one.
So what it is,

2672
02:21:54.140 --> 02:21:57.140
it's anti American.
If they have money for Lacrosse,

2673
02:21:57.170 --> 02:21:59.070
they should have some fucking money for wrestling's.

2674
02:21:59.480 --> 02:22:03.630
How can you play Lacrosse and this day and age and have straight looking at that

2675
02:22:03.690 --> 02:22:07.220
and that costs and stuff is just smiling while you're running around with his

2676
02:22:07.221 --> 02:22:09.680
ball.
And now it's a title nine to a man.
I mean,

2677
02:22:09.681 --> 02:22:13.310
I have nothing against a females doing sports,
but to cancel a program,

2678
02:22:13.311 --> 02:22:15.670
just because you don't have an equal amount of females doing male sports,

2679
02:22:15.690 --> 02:22:18.380
they do a dance program instead of wrestling.

2680
02:22:18.410 --> 02:22:21.610
Like we have a dance program at cal state Fullerton instead of arresting,

2681
02:22:21.860 --> 02:22:25.960
plus the vacation of America,
Tj Dillashaw on Duane Ludwig,

2682
02:22:26.400 --> 02:22:29.980
especially in California.
Man,
like it's not like in the west coat.

2683
02:22:30.000 --> 02:22:34.620
I mean the Midwest wrestling is huge,
you know,
but out here it's just,

2684
02:22:34.900 --> 02:22:38.440
it's not as popular,
so it gets thrown away.
I think that,

2685
02:22:38.620 --> 02:22:40.800
I personally believe that not just wrestling,

2686
02:22:40.801 --> 02:22:45.801
but martial arts programs should be mandatory for all boys growing up.

2687
02:22:46.140 --> 02:22:47.070
And girls too.

2688
02:22:47.460 --> 02:22:51.310
I think girls should at least have rudimentary ideas of self defense.

2689
02:22:51.330 --> 02:22:53.910
Just make our country bad ass.
No one wants to mess with us.

2690
02:22:55.020 --> 02:22:56.610
Survival of the fittest and want to do that,

2691
02:22:56.611 --> 02:22:59.700
but it will also cut the bullying way the fuck down.

2692
02:22:59.701 --> 02:23:01.950
People would be more confident.
I'd be scared.

2693
02:23:02.500 --> 02:23:05.970
People would be less geared and people will be less inclined to just fuck with

2694
02:23:05.971 --> 02:23:08.430
people.
There's a lot of times when people are fucking with people,

2695
02:23:08.431 --> 02:23:11.840
they're doing it because they're insecure and they want some sort of,
yeah,

2696
02:23:11.980 --> 02:23:15.990
they want some sort of an outlet for sure.
That's a big aspect of it.

2697
02:23:16.110 --> 02:23:19.260
But they also want some sort of validation.
But if you can get that in the gym,

2698
02:23:19.410 --> 02:23:22.800
you don't need that out out anywhere else and you can,
you can be more relaxed.

2699
02:23:23.000 --> 02:23:25.710
It's like you were talking about how hard you guys go in the gym and how

2700
02:23:25.711 --> 02:23:26.880
everybody's super competitive.

2701
02:23:26.881 --> 02:23:31.500
But I've seen you guys outside of the gym and everybody's super friendly and not

2702
02:23:31.501 --> 02:23:34.860
just to each other but to other people that you encountered too because there's

2703
02:23:34.861 --> 02:23:38.820
no need to release.
You just know backed up,
pent up frustrated energy.

2704
02:23:39.030 --> 02:23:42.630
And there's also like this,
there's more confidence.
Yeah.

2705
02:23:42.960 --> 02:23:45.510
Well I was telling Duane before we got here,
I don't know what brought it up,

2706
02:23:45.511 --> 02:23:47.550
but during college days or high school,

2707
02:23:47.700 --> 02:23:49.650
I would have no problem getting in a fight in high school and,

2708
02:23:49.890 --> 02:23:53.040
and beaten some kid up outside on the street.
Cause I didn't like him,
you know?

2709
02:23:53.250 --> 02:23:55.560
But now that I'm doing a marshal,
I mean wrestling is martial arts,

2710
02:23:55.561 --> 02:23:59.220
but now that I'm doing like a full on fighting martial arts and I have utmost

2711
02:23:59.221 --> 02:24:01.470
confidence in myself,
it's like I don't want it to go and beat someone up.

2712
02:24:01.470 --> 02:24:04.350
I could really hurt someone.
You know what I mean?
Like I don't want to do it.

2713
02:24:04.560 --> 02:24:06.720
And that's him in the cage getting paid for it.
Yeah.

2714
02:24:06.721 --> 02:24:09.540
And then you're doing it against pro athletes that knows what he's getting

2715
02:24:09.541 --> 02:24:12.600
himself into.
The difference between competing in an assault too.

2716
02:24:12.601 --> 02:24:14.670
That's something we owe.
Sport is so violent.

2717
02:24:14.671 --> 02:24:16.710
You know you were involved in a violent sport,

2718
02:24:16.711 --> 02:24:20.670
Tj Dillashaw but you're such a nice guy.
Yes.

2719
02:24:20.730 --> 02:24:25.730
And but it's also the most extreme test you can put yourself to.

2720
02:24:25.831 --> 02:24:29.410
Sports made me nicer.
I believe that it really has,
this sport has leveled me out,

2721
02:24:29.440 --> 02:24:31.960
made me a whole lot nicer than I used to be I think.
I think in,

2722
02:24:31.980 --> 02:24:35.160
in college and in high school I was a bit meaner of a person than I am now.

2723
02:24:35.250 --> 02:24:39.450
Do you think it's because you burned it out or because you have more confidence?

2724
02:24:39.451 --> 02:24:44.340
Like,
what do you attribute it to?
I just learning to be,

2725
02:24:44.341 --> 02:24:47.430
I don't know,
a little bit more level headed and just uh,
just matured it out.

2726
02:24:47.431 --> 02:24:50.520
Matured.
Yeah.
And then I feel like if I would've been involved in this,

2727
02:24:50.521 --> 02:24:53.100
even at a younger age,
I would have matured a lot faster as well.
Yeah,

2728
02:24:53.101 --> 02:24:56.700
I think so too.
I think that for boys especially,
that's the only,

2729
02:24:56.701 --> 02:25:00.260
I mean obviously I'm male self worth in,
uh,

2730
02:25:01.020 --> 02:25:04.510
and what it takes to be,
to be that person and then afterwards you just kind of,

2731
02:25:04.590 --> 02:25:07.210
I don't know,
you just don't have a chip on your shoulder anymore.
You know,

2732
02:25:07.410 --> 02:25:09.870
you've been in the gym let not as much aggression,

2733
02:25:09.950 --> 02:25:12.480
testosterone as possible and then you get on the street and he's like,

2734
02:25:12.600 --> 02:25:15.680
you don't need to,
you know,
you don't have that pent up aggression.
Yeah.

2735
02:25:15.960 --> 02:25:19.260
I think a lot of people go through life.
A lot of guys go through life with that.

2736
02:25:19.860 --> 02:25:23.630
What does that sound?
Is that your fingers?
What does that,

2737
02:25:24.670 --> 02:25:28.990
<v 7>that's probably me moving your legs so much,
Huh?
Sorry,
carry on.
No,
no,
no.</v>

2738
02:25:29.020 --> 02:25:32.470
There was like a scratchy scratchy in here that,
uh,
I heard it.

2739
02:25:33.190 --> 02:25:36.730
But that extra pent up aggression,

2740
02:25:36.910 --> 02:25:39.640
it's like gives guys like a trigger.
They start reacting to things.

2741
02:25:39.980 --> 02:25:41.920
But if you train training,
you're done training.

2742
02:25:41.921 --> 02:25:44.590
Like I always say like after the gym,
nothing bothers me.

2743
02:25:45.210 --> 02:25:47.290
Nothing like literally nothing.

2744
02:25:47.470 --> 02:25:50.860
Especially if you sparred like people could be yelling at you and you'd be like,

2745
02:25:50.861 --> 02:25:53.110
please don't yell at me.
I got to go.
You know,
it's like,

2746
02:25:54.310 --> 02:25:56.350
especially down here with all the traffic everyone should be doing.

2747
02:25:56.790 --> 02:25:59.730
I know a lot less road rage.
Just go rolling.

2748
02:26:01.180 --> 02:26:04.300
You should just put on drills,
little bit of ecstasy and everybody cared.

2749
02:26:04.320 --> 02:26:08.230
Commissioner titanium is a happy place.
Just a little bit.

2750
02:26:08.231 --> 02:26:12.190
A tiny bit is going to be all right folks.
To see martial arts,

2751
02:26:12.191 --> 02:26:13.180
one of the other pick one,

2752
02:26:13.510 --> 02:26:16.600
they can figure out how to make a car that gives you a little ecstasy as you

2753
02:26:16.601 --> 02:26:20.470
driving just the tiniest amount of ecstasy like they've sown.

2754
02:26:20.471 --> 02:26:25.471
Studies have shown that one microgram of ectasy in your air supply keeps you

2755
02:26:26.651 --> 02:26:30.340
from being in toxified,
but instead of being intoxicated,

2756
02:26:30.460 --> 02:26:33.910
you have a wonderful time during your day and you're more productive and

2757
02:26:33.911 --> 02:26:36.340
friendly to everybody.
That's why Mercedes Benz,

2758
02:26:37.450 --> 02:26:38.850
those things to go through the roof,
dude,

2759
02:26:38.860 --> 02:26:40.770
everyone will be buying them and be cranking them.

2760
02:26:44.470 --> 02:26:46.030
They're not a turn it up a little bit more.

2761
02:26:46.840 --> 02:26:50.200
[inaudible] sees your car got in it.

2762
02:26:51.640 --> 02:26:55.710
I feel like that's what moody,
New Moody's for me,
man.
I love new mood,

2763
02:26:55.711 --> 02:26:58.760
like new movies.
One of my favorite products,
the ANA does it.

2764
02:26:58.890 --> 02:27:02.680
Like that's the one I can feel the most difference with.
His new mood and t plus.

2765
02:27:02.920 --> 02:27:07.330
Yeah,
I love new mood too.
And anybody who's interested in five HTP supplements,

2766
02:27:07.360 --> 02:27:08.470
which is what new mood is,

2767
02:27:08.471 --> 02:27:12.430
you've gotta be really careful that you're not on Ssri is if you're on any sort

2768
02:27:12.431 --> 02:27:15.700
of antidepressants,
Zoloft,
things along those lines.
Uh,

2769
02:27:15.730 --> 02:27:20.650
Serotonin reuptake inhibitors,
I forget how the actual,
what it stands for,

2770
02:27:20.651 --> 02:27:23.920
but that's,
you can have something called Serotonin Syndrome.

2771
02:27:23.921 --> 02:27:25.210
We have too much serotonin.

2772
02:27:25.370 --> 02:27:28.510
I like the new mood elevates your serotonin and then so do these uh,

2773
02:27:28.511 --> 02:27:30.550
these drugs as well.
But uh,

2774
02:27:30.551 --> 02:27:34.390
for people that might be too happy then or why our face probably dangerous.

2775
02:27:34.780 --> 02:27:39.370
It's like your body take too much new moon.
No,
no,
I don't think so.

2776
02:27:39.371 --> 02:27:41.500
I mean you'd have to take a lot,
you'd have to take a lot.

2777
02:27:41.501 --> 02:27:45.610
If I take four pills at a shot and I'll on a like a stressful day,

2778
02:27:45.611 --> 02:27:47.960
I'll do that twice a crazy day.
If I go,

2779
02:27:48.250 --> 02:27:51.160
I have a lot of shit going on and I've never had any negative effects at all.

2780
02:27:51.161 --> 02:27:54.490
But I think if you're going to be careful,

2781
02:27:54.491 --> 02:27:57.390
you should probably take less than I do.
I think I'm fucking around.

2782
02:27:57.760 --> 02:28:00.860
I think about,
I take four,
four alphabets before the fights to y z two,

2783
02:28:01.860 --> 02:28:05.210
four Alpha brain before every show.
One before,
before,
before we got in here too.

2784
02:28:05.290 --> 02:28:09.070
I take four Alpha brain for every comedy show before every broadcast I take
four.

2785
02:28:09.630 --> 02:28:10.463
Yeah.

2786
02:28:10.590 --> 02:28:14.260
Now that I feel like I've noticed more of a longterm then like right away like

2787
02:28:14.290 --> 02:28:18.270
Alpha brain,
I've noticed like my concentration and stuff from longterm,

2788
02:28:18.280 --> 02:28:21.100
I don't notice it like that day but like over like a month.
But like damn,

2789
02:28:21.190 --> 02:28:22.310
I picked up stuff a lot faster.

2790
02:28:22.311 --> 02:28:25.790
It's a subtle increase and it used to be a little bit more potent.
But uh,

2791
02:28:25.791 --> 02:28:27.860
we were having problems that people were getting headaches from it.

2792
02:28:27.861 --> 02:28:29.740
There was a larger number of people where

2793
02:28:32.190 --> 02:28:33.350
I wasn't getting headaches.

2794
02:28:34.390 --> 02:28:36.530
Now we have to take eight of them cause he has lowered the dose.

2795
02:28:36.560 --> 02:28:39.590
Well we've talked about um,
no I,
I still feel a big,

2796
02:28:39.860 --> 02:28:43.670
big difference from these and the clinical trial that we did,
the double blind,

2797
02:28:43.820 --> 02:28:45.620
that was what this,
this particular formula,

2798
02:28:45.830 --> 02:28:49.430
but I still think that we should release a fucking hyper version for people were

2799
02:28:49.431 --> 02:28:50.030
savages.

2800
02:28:50.030 --> 02:28:53.720
Oh you want to get crazy even if you don't want her own skull and crossbones on

2801
02:28:53.721 --> 02:28:57.000
it.
If we can't release it,
can I at least get something?

2802
02:29:00.560 --> 02:29:01.690
We can get you something.
Well,

2803
02:29:01.700 --> 02:29:04.580
I think this is just the beginning of this sort of science of,
uh,

2804
02:29:04.620 --> 02:29:08.180
of nootropics and they're coming up with all sorts of different combinations.

2805
02:29:08.190 --> 02:29:12.310
These things Paraskeva town.
I want that stuff to be like,
oh,
that shit,

2806
02:29:12.320 --> 02:29:14.690
my favorite.
Limitless.
Love that movie,
man.

2807
02:29:16.330 --> 02:29:17.660
That's America and a nutshell.

2808
02:29:17.661 --> 02:29:20.630
Everybody's wants to be a lazy fuck that you take a pill and then said your

2809
02:29:20.631 --> 02:29:23.750
suits man.
Gotta work for it.
Isn't it funny though,

2810
02:29:23.751 --> 02:29:26.930
how many God damn movies there are about a dumb person all sudden becomes super

2811
02:29:26.931 --> 02:29:28.790
smart and figures the whole fucking world out.

2812
02:29:29.250 --> 02:29:31.930
Like John Travolta when you got hit by lightning?
That's right.

2813
02:29:32.460 --> 02:29:35.730
All of a sudden these fucking learning Portuguese and shit.
Yeah,

2814
02:29:36.260 --> 02:29:37.093
that was a good one.

2815
02:29:37.930 --> 02:29:40.670
Trying to get struck by lightning and stuffs like it'd be smarter.
Well,

2816
02:29:40.671 --> 02:29:43.820
you know what does work with some things like people have,

2817
02:29:43.821 --> 02:29:48.821
like I have a friend and her son got in a motorcycle accident and then he got a

2818
02:29:49.671 --> 02:29:54.080
head injury and became super artistic after the motorcycle injury.
Yeah.

2819
02:29:54.530 --> 02:29:59.160
So we do need to get hit in the head.
Well,
Zach Science,

2820
02:29:59.720 --> 02:30:03.320
that's the problem.
Sam Kinison got hit and they had a,
when he was a kid too,

2821
02:30:03.321 --> 02:30:07.250
he got hit by a truck.
Oh,
I heard about this.
Yeah.
And it fucking switch.

2822
02:30:07.251 --> 02:30:11.270
You'd be like a normal,
calm,
shy kid.
And then he got hit by a truck and I'll sign

2823
02:30:12.990 --> 02:30:17.820
this fucking wild,
impulsive maniac.
That's crazy.
Honestly.
Yeah.
Well,

2824
02:30:17.840 --> 02:30:21.290
head injuries are just very strange.
It's very strange.
The reactions that a,

2825
02:30:21.291 --> 02:30:23.240
that head injuries have,
you know,

2826
02:30:23.241 --> 02:30:27.830
people have had car accidents and then become gay.
Oh Wow.
Yeah.

2827
02:30:27.950 --> 02:30:32.360
Really.
No Way.
I might have no,
I'm not feeling no,
no.

2828
02:30:33.500 --> 02:30:36.890
Hold on a second.
Head trauma turns back it up.
No,
I don't think so.

2829
02:30:36.920 --> 02:30:40.730
Some guy who was,
who was gay and it's used as an excuse.
That's fine.

2830
02:30:42.050 --> 02:30:42.900
I'm not judging it.

2831
02:30:45.050 --> 02:30:48.340
Rugby player wakes up gay after a stroke.
Wow.

2832
02:30:48.380 --> 02:30:50.360
He had a stroke and then he woke up and he was gay.

2833
02:30:50.570 --> 02:30:54.080
Someone took care of him when he was barely rugby player has a stroke after

2834
02:30:54.081 --> 02:30:58.790
freak gym accident,
let me up gay and becomes a hairdresser.
That's just as to me,

2835
02:30:58.791 --> 02:31:00.680
whatever.
I mean he's gained.
Yeah,
it's cool.
Whatever.
You know,

2836
02:31:00.710 --> 02:31:01.700
this is that guy earlier,

2837
02:31:01.701 --> 02:31:06.701
but so the fuck does not look like a rugby player either.

2838
02:31:07.790 --> 02:31:10.190
But I mean he doesn't even make up an excuse of getting hit in the head to be

2839
02:31:10.191 --> 02:31:13.790
gaming and just whoever your gates,
you don't know,

2840
02:31:14.540 --> 02:31:16.580
maybe really did have a stroke and woke up gay,

2841
02:31:17.230 --> 02:31:18.950
but he used to look like straight as fuck.

2842
02:31:22.230 --> 02:31:24.090
He looked straight.
We'll,
you know,
there was um,

2843
02:31:24.150 --> 02:31:27.170
there was a drug called reequip that uh,

2844
02:31:27.171 --> 02:31:29.640
an Irish man won a settlement of,

2845
02:31:29.641 --> 02:31:34.641
I believe it was like 600,000 US dollars because this drug turned him gay and

2846
02:31:35.221 --> 02:31:38.940
into a gambling addict.
She was having unsafe sex and he was,
uh,

2847
02:31:39.210 --> 02:31:44.210
he was going like meeting people online and getting fucking crazy with dude's

2848
02:31:44.311 --> 02:31:47.580
and do a bunch of gay shit.
And he was a family man.
Married guy won.
He Won.

2849
02:31:47.670 --> 02:31:50.790
How do you prove that?
That's a very good question,
TJ.

2850
02:31:50.791 --> 02:31:54.480
Dillashaw I like how you think fucking know man.

2851
02:31:54.690 --> 02:31:56.160
But not only did they prove it,

2852
02:31:56.310 --> 02:32:00.600
I mean this was against Glaxo Klein to Glaxo clients.
Smith,

2853
02:32:00.601 --> 02:32:03.420
the big pharmaceutical companies.
Yeah,
they're the ones who lost.

2854
02:32:03.540 --> 02:32:06.360
So it was their lawyers lost this case.

2855
02:32:06.840 --> 02:32:11.190
It was so much evidence here,
I'll pull it up.
Re-Equip this.

2856
02:32:11.250 --> 02:32:14.920
There must be so much fucking evidence.
Turns a man Gai.
Wow,

2857
02:32:16.350 --> 02:32:20.790
that is crazy.
There's so much evidence that they actually had to give him money,

2858
02:32:20.970 --> 02:32:24.990
which was an amazing,
yeah,
he won 160,000 pounds,

2859
02:32:25.260 --> 02:32:29.010
which is roughly somewhere around,
what's the,

2860
02:32:29.020 --> 02:32:32.640
that weird l looking thing?
It's not a pound.
I have no,
the one shore.

2861
02:32:34.000 --> 02:32:38.140
Um,
anyway,
whatever the,
the,
the amount of this was,
it was,

2862
02:32:38.330 --> 02:32:42.540
it was $160,000.
Way Too much.
He took care of it.
So 160 bucks,

2863
02:32:42.541 --> 02:32:44.760
he shouldn't get paid for them.
Nothing.
Somebody got,

2864
02:32:44.820 --> 02:32:46.230
somebody got the manipulatives.
Well,

2865
02:32:46.231 --> 02:32:51.000
he had Parkinson's and so this was a Parkinson's medication and it turned him

2866
02:32:51.001 --> 02:32:53.130
into a gay sex and gambling addict.

2867
02:32:54.360 --> 02:32:57.630
Amazing impulsive control systems.

2868
02:32:57.950 --> 02:33:02.250
And this is where it gets really weird,
including compulsive behaviors.

2869
02:33:02.470 --> 02:33:06.990
They ever been.
Reports of patients experiencing intense urges to gamble,

2870
02:33:07.200 --> 02:33:11.940
increased sexual urges and other intense urges and the inability to control

2871
02:33:11.941 --> 02:33:16.890
those urges while taking one or more of the medications that increase central

2872
02:33:16.950 --> 02:33:20.870
dope.
Dope.
It's dope.
Amid jet,
uh,

2873
02:33:21.180 --> 02:33:23.760
Minard chick dopaminergic,

2874
02:33:23.910 --> 02:33:28.260
dopaminergic menergy tones that are generally used for the treatment of

2875
02:33:28.261 --> 02:33:31.730
Parkinson's disease.
So this is an restless leg syndrome.

2876
02:33:31.820 --> 02:33:34.140
When you see when dudes like you can't stop moving their legs.

2877
02:33:34.350 --> 02:33:37.170
That's my parking sky.
Does he have any daughters?

2878
02:33:40.080 --> 02:33:42.690
Is that a job?
Should have worked on that one a little bit more for you.

2879
02:33:42.691 --> 02:33:47.070
Let it loose skin sons.
He had Parkinson's.
Oh,
you're so retarded.

2880
02:33:47.450 --> 02:33:51.600
It doesn't work.
He can't keep,
keep trying.
He's like,
come on guys.

2881
02:33:51.601 --> 02:33:55.050
Parking son wears his daughters when they get it,

2882
02:33:55.430 --> 02:33:58.900
they still want to fuck.
I thought it was funny,
but I think,
well you missed it.

2883
02:33:59.240 --> 02:34:03.600
Please don't encourage him.
We both passed it.
There was nothing there.
The um,

2884
02:34:03.990 --> 02:34:06.600
the idea that a,
that a drug could do that too though,

2885
02:34:06.601 --> 02:34:08.550
is pretty fucking shocking drug.

2886
02:34:08.551 --> 02:34:10.770
It turns you into acting like a lot of other people in the world.
Well,

2887
02:34:10.771 --> 02:34:13.230
not just acting like a lot of the people in the world,
but you were a normal guy,

2888
02:34:13.250 --> 02:34:16.410
was a control of your urges and then all of a sudden you're just flying off the

2889
02:34:16.411 --> 02:34:19.830
handle meet and dudes online.
They're just,
there you go,
Brian.

2890
02:34:19.860 --> 02:34:23.250
We should do that as a test.
Just get you on this shit.
I would love to try it.

2891
02:34:23.260 --> 02:34:26.290
[inaudible] he would totally do it.
He'd be the best Guinea pig.

2892
02:34:27.740 --> 02:34:32.050
We give him a monthly budget and a videographer and a nice,

2893
02:34:32.110 --> 02:34:34.630
it would be at like Dick.
It'd be easy.
That's the thing in the rural,

2894
02:34:34.631 --> 02:34:37.780
if you just craved it instead of having to deal with all this nonsense.

2895
02:34:37.840 --> 02:34:41.500
That's what I'm saying.
Damn.
I mean,
look,

2896
02:34:41.560 --> 02:34:44.470
everybody wants to say there's something wrong with,
with being gay,

2897
02:34:44.471 --> 02:34:48.520
but you live and you die and if you're straight,
you look at gang go,
oh,

2898
02:34:48.521 --> 02:34:51.460
I don't want that.
But guess what?
If you're straight,
you look at if you're gay,

2899
02:34:51.461 --> 02:34:53.440
rather you look at the trait and go,
I don't want that.

2900
02:34:54.010 --> 02:34:56.650
What you like is what you like and if you like gay,

2901
02:34:56.651 --> 02:34:59.920
it would be awesome to be gay.
Yeah,
there's spots.

2902
02:35:00.230 --> 02:35:03.160
I had doctors ready to go do my physicals and stuff for the fight.
They say,

2903
02:35:03.161 --> 02:35:06.400
why are you fighting?
Like,
why are you doing this?
Like fuck man.
I don't know.

2904
02:35:06.401 --> 02:35:10.840
But it's fun.
Yeah.
My levels of testosterone,
I think,

2905
02:35:11.170 --> 02:35:13.810
well if you go down to Santa Monica Boulevard,
if you're a gay guy,

2906
02:35:13.840 --> 02:35:16.180
there's like a one stop shop.
You just,

2907
02:35:16.230 --> 02:35:19.690
you just take your shirt off and just walk to the crowd and to just start

2908
02:35:19.691 --> 02:35:22.030
blowing you mean?
That's what I hear.

2909
02:35:22.790 --> 02:35:27.610
That's what I hear very different because it's all Yang because Yang,
Yang,

2910
02:35:27.611 --> 02:35:30.910
Yang,
Yang,
Yang.
There's no Yin's like there's no like,
oh,
I don't know.

2911
02:35:30.911 --> 02:35:33.700
You just want to use me.
None of that.
They're using each other.

2912
02:35:33.701 --> 02:35:36.670
They're just fucking blasted each other.
They're having a great time.

2913
02:35:37.060 --> 02:35:41.100
They understand each other.
There's no confusion,
there's no navigate.
You know,

2914
02:35:41.160 --> 02:35:46.160
like navigating relationship with a woman is like putting rubber gloves on in

2915
02:35:46.331 --> 02:35:50.500
the dark and putting your hands into one of those incubation tubes and try to do

2916
02:35:50.501 --> 02:35:53.770
a Rubik's cube.
Like what?
I can't see what the fuck's going on here.

2917
02:35:54.130 --> 02:35:56.980
You have to like take their word for what is happening here.
Oh,

2918
02:35:56.981 --> 02:36:01.000
you're upset that I went out with my friends.
Oh,
okay.
I guess.
No more friends.

2919
02:36:01.380 --> 02:36:04.560
You my friend.
How are you?
What's going on here?
That's you.

2920
02:36:04.720 --> 02:36:08.400
We don't know how they think.
I think I got a good Rubik's cube.
I was like,
dude,

2921
02:36:08.590 --> 02:36:10.150
well you got a good one.
That's the key.

2922
02:36:10.151 --> 02:36:13.670
Get a Rubik's cube that you could figure out.
But dudes,
no one dude's,

2923
02:36:13.671 --> 02:36:18.640
they're like,
oh you like Dick Guy Pod
fucking,

2924
02:36:18.641 --> 02:36:22.600
they know what's going on.
I like,
we both liked each other.
They Bang it out.

2925
02:36:23.560 --> 02:36:26.650
He's more easy.
You were offered this drug.
If you weren't married,

2926
02:36:26.651 --> 02:36:28.000
would you try it?
You know,

2927
02:36:28.001 --> 02:36:32.860
I'd have to be committed because you see women can dance back and forth from the

2928
02:36:32.861 --> 02:36:37.630
world of gay and straight with an effortless finesse.
They can.

2929
02:36:38.050 --> 02:36:41.230
They can easily go back and forth.
Not only that,
it makes them more attractive.

2930
02:36:41.231 --> 02:36:44.350
They can say things like,
[inaudible] like to talk about this.

2931
02:36:44.351 --> 02:36:48.460
But I was gay for like a year,
shut up for a year.

2932
02:36:48.461 --> 02:36:52.490
I had a girlfriend and you know,
I just was like,
men are assholes.
I'm done.

2933
02:36:52.491 --> 02:36:53.111
And you're like,

2934
02:36:53.111 --> 02:36:58.111
your dick is like kind of just a raging missile in your parents.

2935
02:36:59.511 --> 02:37:04.510
Like where is she?
Tell her to come stay with us.

2936
02:37:04.790 --> 02:37:09.110
You know,
that was the first thought in every guy for sure.
For sure.
She's like,

2937
02:37:09.180 --> 02:37:10.510
it's okay.
It doesn't even bother me.

2938
02:37:11.250 --> 02:37:13.510
If you came home and you find your girlfriend eating pussy,
you wouldn't be like,

2939
02:37:13.540 --> 02:37:16.910
what the fuck to be like,
oh,
what's going on here?

2940
02:37:18.190 --> 02:37:22.400
Just take your clothes off and come in the room.
Like,
Hey,
as long as the girls,

2941
02:37:22.401 --> 02:37:26.520
the girlfriend is not like all jealous and fucking plotty look,

2942
02:37:28.130 --> 02:37:31.220
you better keep it away from me.
Oh my gosh.
Someone's ruin the party

2943
02:37:33.740 --> 02:37:35.280
as long as she's friendly too.

2944
02:37:36.860 --> 02:37:40.460
But if a girl comes home and her boyfriend is stuck in a car,
that's a bummer.

2945
02:37:41.110 --> 02:37:43.400
You come home and your boyfriend is blown the plumber,

2946
02:37:43.401 --> 02:37:46.730
that is a fucking straight bummer,
you know?

2947
02:37:47.150 --> 02:37:51.110
But if you came home and like you know your wife had went to fucking lunch with

2948
02:37:51.111 --> 02:37:53.780
some chick was in aerobics class and they're eating each other out when you

2949
02:37:53.781 --> 02:37:56.420
walked through the door.
It's really not that big of a deal.

2950
02:37:56.421 --> 02:37:59.660
It's a little surprising.
Like,
Whoa,
this is crazy.

2951
02:38:01.040 --> 02:38:05.720
The accident mail sacks is a very different act.
It's very,

2952
02:38:05.840 --> 02:38:10.610
so,
no,
I wouldn't take that pill
to answer your question.

2953
02:38:13.550 --> 02:38:17.420
Would you take it you think you would take it?
No,
no,
no.
Girls are better.

2954
02:38:17.840 --> 02:38:19.280
They're prettier.
They smell better.

2955
02:38:19.320 --> 02:38:23.750
Would be interesting to try it though if there was a a a a serum,

2956
02:38:23.930 --> 02:38:27.770
you know what I mean?
Like I like Dick.
That's so weird.
All right,
nevermind.

2957
02:38:27.771 --> 02:38:31.670
That was weird though.
Yeah,
I wouldn't mind curious.

2958
02:38:33.600 --> 02:38:38.420
Cool.
I wouldn't mind being that girl for a day.
This is what I say.
If I was,

2959
02:38:38.450 --> 02:38:42.350
if I,
if there's a possibility that you could go into someone's mind,

2960
02:38:42.620 --> 02:38:43.740
like say this,
say if you,

2961
02:38:43.741 --> 02:38:47.420
you and your girlfriend got together and you went into a machine and you swapped

2962
02:38:47.421 --> 02:38:50.540
positions,
like she became the girl and you became the guy.

2963
02:38:50.570 --> 02:38:52.430
Like you had all your knowledge of life,

2964
02:38:52.580 --> 02:38:57.260
but all of a sudden you thought like a girl and you wanted to get fucked and you

2965
02:38:57.261 --> 02:39:02.030
want to get fucked by you because she's,
you know,
and you are her.

2966
02:39:02.210 --> 02:39:06.620
So you liked boys and you liked you and that would be a way that you could be

2967
02:39:06.621 --> 02:39:09.470
gay but not be gay because he'd be gay for yourself.

2968
02:39:10.000 --> 02:39:13.320
So you would switch positions with your girlfriend or,
or what,

2969
02:39:13.321 --> 02:39:16.400
so you have her thoughts.
She would be banging you doggy style.
You're like,
wow,

2970
02:39:16.401 --> 02:39:20.720
this does hurt my service.
This is kind of annoying.
She wasn't lying.

2971
02:39:20.721 --> 02:39:24.310
She could be,
she can feel what it's like to get head and going,
oh,

2972
02:39:24.320 --> 02:39:28.490
now I know why you're always trying to get me to do this.
This is pretty awesome.

2973
02:39:29.250 --> 02:39:33.110
She's like,
I,
it's odd.
I like it better when I'm looking at it crazy.

2974
02:39:33.530 --> 02:39:35.870
I like it better when I'm looking at you doing this.

2975
02:39:35.871 --> 02:39:38.980
I never would have imagined that.
Now I know why you're always creeping me out.

2976
02:39:39.400 --> 02:39:42.550
I need to invent this machine just to make the relationship better and make

2977
02:39:42.600 --> 02:39:47.450
everyone's relationship.
Well,
there's a problem now man.

2978
02:39:47.451 --> 02:39:51.170
There's this weird competition between men and women.
There's US versus them,

2979
02:39:51.500 --> 02:39:55.430
you know,
and there's a bunch of sneaky fucks that sneak on the other side.

2980
02:39:55.640 --> 02:40:00.440
Both men and women.
There's a bunch of women down to hang with men.
You know,

2981
02:40:00.441 --> 02:40:02.390
this is a girl.
She like to come over your house and no,

2982
02:40:02.391 --> 02:40:06.060
she can watch sports with us.
Yeah.
Fuck she can.
Goddamn trader,

2983
02:40:06.230 --> 02:40:09.740
gender trader over here sneaking around collecting data to bring back to the

2984
02:40:09.890 --> 02:40:10.723
data.

2985
02:40:11.060 --> 02:40:14.160
And that's the same way with men and men who you know like the White Knights

2986
02:40:14.270 --> 02:40:15.470
<v 0>like Stan this,</v>

2987
02:40:15.480 --> 02:40:19.110
there's white knights that start shit that there's nothing like a man and a

2988
02:40:19.111 --> 02:40:22.840
woman could be having a disagreement,
like a calm disagreement and some dickhead.

2989
02:40:22.850 --> 02:40:26.100
We'll walk up and go,
is he bothering you?
Is there a problem here?

2990
02:40:26.270 --> 02:40:28.830
Like oh you grow sack of shit.

2991
02:40:28.831 --> 02:40:31.980
How dare you now people not even raising their foot wall.

2992
02:40:31.981 --> 02:40:34.980
I saw is you being a dick to a beautiful woman.
Like there's,

2993
02:40:35.040 --> 02:40:36.810
there's a lot of those guys out there,

2994
02:40:36.900 --> 02:40:41.070
they'll insert themselves whether it's verbally into an internet situation or

2995
02:40:41.071 --> 02:40:42.810
there it's physically in a bar.

2996
02:40:42.930 --> 02:40:47.930
Just nosy cunts are totally out of line that we'll pretend that you're being

2997
02:40:48.511 --> 02:40:51.320
aggressive and you know,
I've seen it happen with a girl.

2998
02:40:51.321 --> 02:40:52.530
It's like get the fuck outta here.

2999
02:40:52.650 --> 02:40:55.650
No we're just talking about that so you're not,
you're not a part of this.

3000
02:40:56.090 --> 02:40:59.070
I came over to help you and the girl was like,
I don't need your fucking house.

3001
02:40:59.430 --> 02:41:01.500
Like what are you doing man?
And then the dude,

3002
02:41:01.530 --> 02:41:04.650
but the dude had his mouth open and dude was like,
are you fucking serious?

3003
02:41:04.990 --> 02:41:07.980
I can't believe this guy came over.
That's super common.

3004
02:41:08.220 --> 02:41:12.750
Super common that sanctimonious Shithead dudes will step in as the White Knight.

3005
02:41:12.870 --> 02:41:17.870
Those guys are disgusting cause they have this like fucking moral high ground.

3006
02:41:18.510 --> 02:41:20.850
Like almost like they're going to come over and rescue someone.

3007
02:41:21.120 --> 02:41:23.070
It doesn't mean it's like,
do you remember

3008
02:41:24.960 --> 02:41:28.560
back at the same time exactly.
Trying to sneak it on your chick.
Exactly.

3009
02:41:28.561 --> 02:41:31.230
You know what I mean?
Like exactly.
This guy's a dick.
Leave him for me.
Come on,

3010
02:41:31.231 --> 02:41:34.860
let's go.
Do you remember those?
A Guardian Angel dudes.

3011
02:41:35.010 --> 02:41:36.000
Do you remember those guys?

3012
02:41:36.001 --> 02:41:40.650
They would wear berets and this fucking fight crime and shit.
Yeah.

3013
02:41:40.690 --> 02:41:44.430
Do you remember that?
Yeah,
the,
well they found out here's what happened to him.

3014
02:41:44.430 --> 02:41:49.110
One of them faked a rape that he helped a rescue.
Someone,
you know,

3015
02:41:49.111 --> 02:41:51.780
he like,
he faked it and then you know,

3016
02:41:51.781 --> 02:41:55.470
stepped in and saved the day and they caught him and it's like everybody was

3017
02:41:55.471 --> 02:41:58.450
like,
what the fuck are you doing?
The guy became like a radio,

3018
02:41:58.451 --> 02:42:01.830
a guy who was like doing,
you know,
a radio show for a while.

3019
02:42:02.010 --> 02:42:03.480
But those kind of guys,

3020
02:42:03.481 --> 02:42:06.660
they would be like walking around like looking for people to save.

3021
02:42:06.680 --> 02:42:09.080
Sometimes they would be like directing traffic.

3022
02:42:09.090 --> 02:42:12.450
I remember I was in Boston and I was in traffic and I'm,

3023
02:42:12.451 --> 02:42:15.480
I'm sitting there at a red light and this dude's a guardian angel and he's got

3024
02:42:15.481 --> 02:42:16.140
the baret on.

3025
02:42:16.140 --> 02:42:18.990
He's dressed like a fucking superhero and I look over at him and I'm,

3026
02:42:18.991 --> 02:42:21.190
and I'm with my friend,
I'm like,
look at this guy over here,

3027
02:42:21.220 --> 02:42:24.330
what is going to go on?
And I look over the guy and the guy's like,
fuck you.

3028
02:42:24.840 --> 02:42:28.560
He's giving me the finger.
And just because I was looking at him like,
dude,

3029
02:42:29.430 --> 02:42:33.720
you're wearing an outfit from another era.
Like you have a bra on Sir.

3030
02:42:33.900 --> 02:42:37.320
Like are you a poet?
And in France,
like what are you doing?

3031
02:42:37.820 --> 02:42:42.390
Who are they still around?
Safety.
Patrol.
Yeah.

3032
02:42:42.391 --> 02:42:46.910
That's the guy.
That guy in the middle.
He's the guy that fake the rape.
Yeah,

3033
02:42:47.010 --> 02:42:50.490
I guess.
But they,
these baret wearing fucking shit heads.

3034
02:42:50.500 --> 02:42:55.240
I'm wandering the streets.
So strange.
I mean not naughty bus.
The naughty,

3035
02:42:55.290 --> 02:42:57.180
I'll cancel.
I need that shit.

3036
02:42:57.750 --> 02:43:01.050
The Guardian Angels countdown with the Goddamn and listening to people in every

3037
02:43:01.051 --> 02:43:05.080
position.
Then of course overall the overall mission of that is good.

3038
02:43:05.110 --> 02:43:08.770
It's cool though.
Yeah.
Well if it was legit,
yeah,

3039
02:43:09.040 --> 02:43:12.190
and maybe it is in some circumstances,
but what I'm going back

3040
02:43:12.190 --> 02:43:13.750
<v 7>to is those fucking white knight ass,</v>

3041
02:43:13.751 --> 02:43:17.620
all those guys who pretend pretend is a nice problem.

3042
02:43:18.400 --> 02:43:22.930
You see it online to traders,
you fucking pussies.

3043
02:43:22.931 --> 02:43:25.450
You're the opposite of clinics.
Wouldn't all his best movies.

3044
02:43:25.810 --> 02:43:29.800
That's what you've heard.
Way Little Bitches,
sad pitches with,

3045
02:43:29.801 --> 02:43:33.490
with weak sperm.
No one wants any of it to the martial arts.

3046
02:43:33.520 --> 02:43:36.700
They'd be even more respectful human beings.
They would have more confidence.

3047
02:43:36.701 --> 02:43:39.550
They wouldn't have to take that sneaky move,
the sneaky move.

3048
02:43:39.551 --> 02:43:42.910
We're trying to paint other men as a victim or other men as the aggressor when

3049
02:43:42.911 --> 02:43:46.360
they're not.
That's a common thing with guys.
I see that or did you know,

3050
02:43:46.361 --> 02:43:47.350
and then there's also,

3051
02:43:47.351 --> 02:43:51.370
there's guys that do fucking suck and this guys that we have to call out that

3052
02:43:51.371 --> 02:43:53.410
men have to go,
this guy's a fucking cunt.

3053
02:43:53.650 --> 02:43:56.920
You know that the guys that are ruining it for other men because they treat

3054
02:43:56.921 --> 02:43:59.080
women like shit.
There's that too,

3055
02:43:59.350 --> 02:44:02.440
but it's hard to distinguish when you got your fake ass white nights out there

3056
02:44:02.441 --> 02:44:05.230
muddying the water.
They're ruining it.
Just peeing in the pool.

3057
02:44:05.440 --> 02:44:09.340
Good judge of character,
cry and cry and Walter the judges.
But that's the thing,

3058
02:44:09.341 --> 02:44:11.540
right?
The judge of character had society.

3059
02:44:12.430 --> 02:44:14.250
Those are women and there's a bunch of old ladies.

3060
02:44:14.710 --> 02:44:18.040
Those ladies are very friendly.
How dare you see,

3061
02:44:18.041 --> 02:44:19.710
that's the thing about women's groups,
man.

3062
02:44:19.870 --> 02:44:23.770
You don't worried about them beating people up like fucking guardian angels or

3063
02:44:23.950 --> 02:44:26.860
Hell's angels.
He,
you know,
he could run into a bunch of dudes.

3064
02:44:26.870 --> 02:44:30.280
[inaudible] you're in a possible ass kicking stereo red hats.

3065
02:44:30.310 --> 02:44:32.650
What are those bitches going to do?
It's very few.

3066
02:44:33.180 --> 02:44:35.170
Very few riots started by Red Hat women

3067
02:44:37.640 --> 02:44:40.180
you get out of my yard.

3068
02:44:44.170 --> 02:44:48.460
So this fight,
let's go back to this five round fight.

3069
02:44:49.230 --> 02:44:51.790
What,
what is the next day like after a fight like that?

3070
02:44:51.791 --> 02:44:55.030
What kind of injuries you dealing with kind of soreness?
Are you dealing with

3071
02:44:55.120 --> 02:44:59.800
<v 3>my,
luckily all offensive,
uh,
injuries,
you know,
like my right hand was sore.</v>

3072
02:44:59.930 --> 02:45:04.120
It's just feeling better now.
My right elbow,
left Shin,

3073
02:45:04.210 --> 02:45:07.720
right Shane kind of deal just from throwing strikes.
You know,
I got,
I got,

3074
02:45:07.721 --> 02:45:10.750
I got cut a little tiny cut on my head,
but for the most part feeling good.

3075
02:45:11.110 --> 02:45:13.940
You know,
I didn't take too much damage at all and uh,
you know,

3076
02:45:13.941 --> 02:45:16.750
a little bruise and my,
my nose always gets kind of,
it's just always in the way.

3077
02:45:17.140 --> 02:45:19.060
But um,
yeah it felt great man.

3078
02:45:19.370 --> 02:45:23.000
<v 7>Do you see these injuries like Anderson Silva,
Tyrone Spong,</v>

3079
02:45:23.001 --> 02:45:25.130
these leg check leg break injuries,

3080
02:45:25.131 --> 02:45:28.880
which is crazy to see two of them in the course of a few months by super high

3081
02:45:28.881 --> 02:45:32.810
level fighters.
Um,
well Duane I should ask you this,
probably as a coach,

3082
02:45:33.020 --> 02:45:36.170
what do you would attribute that to and how can guys prevent that from
happening?

3083
02:45:36.171 --> 02:45:38.480
Cause it's some of the most horrific shit I've ever seen.

3084
02:45:38.520 --> 02:45:40.350
<v 6>I don't know if it was a preexisting injury already.</v>

3085
02:45:40.351 --> 02:45:43.440
If they had an injury going into the fight over happened then or if it's just

3086
02:45:43.441 --> 02:45:45.150
blocking wrong and not turn the toes out,

3087
02:45:45.151 --> 02:45:48.180
make sure line up the shins are buffering the blow or if they went into it.

3088
02:45:48.181 --> 02:45:52.650
So it's a couple know x factors there.
But you know,
I don't know.
I mean if you,

3089
02:45:52.651 --> 02:45:55.230
if think you seen it more and more than it would be something that's happening

3090
02:45:55.231 --> 02:45:57.780
during the injury camp.
And I think that those just to freak accidents.

3091
02:45:57.781 --> 02:46:01.140
Well it's happened.
Well it happened at Carlos condit to someone kicked him,

3092
02:46:01.141 --> 02:46:03.000
they broke their ankle also on a king of the cage fight.

3093
02:46:03.001 --> 02:46:05.760
But I'm not sure to be honest man.
I just have to,

3094
02:46:06.270 --> 02:46:10.010
<v 7>the hill was the court he'll also,
yeah,
he was a real tall skinny guy.</v>

3095
02:46:10.030 --> 02:46:11.690
<v 0>Yup.
So we sort of attributed to that.</v>

3096
02:46:11.691 --> 02:46:15.560
Like he was one 55 when he was so maybe cutting too much weight,

3097
02:46:16.160 --> 02:46:19.040
cutting too much weight you think has an impact on bone density body.

3098
02:46:19.041 --> 02:46:22.940
I don't know.
But Anderson didn't really cut too much weight,
did he?
He's,

3099
02:46:23.060 --> 02:46:24.440
he cuts way.
He gets pretty heavy.

3100
02:46:24.490 --> 02:46:26.840
And Tyrone Spong definitely caught weight when you made that Gloria.

3101
02:46:27.250 --> 02:46:28.083
I don't know though.

3102
02:46:28.370 --> 02:46:31.700
I know he caught it cause they were talking about it because he had two fights.

3103
02:46:31.701 --> 02:46:34.670
Go Con Saki had two fights would go con Saki won the first fight.

3104
02:46:34.910 --> 02:46:37.700
He fought Nathan Corbett and knocked him out with a,
not knocked him out,

3105
02:46:37.701 --> 02:46:40.280
but he hit him with a left hook and his,
his ears started bleeding real bad.

3106
02:46:40.460 --> 02:46:41.780
They stopped that fight in the first round.

3107
02:46:41.781 --> 02:46:44.790
He blew out his eardrum and then so he got a first round stoppage.

3108
02:46:44.810 --> 02:46:48.800
But then Tyrone Spong fought this Brazilian cat and went three hard rounds with

3109
02:46:48.801 --> 02:46:52.700
them and then they fought again that night.
I have a problem with that.

3110
02:46:52.880 --> 02:46:56.670
I think that I love glory and I'm so happy that bring in high level kickboxing

3111
02:46:56.680 --> 02:46:57.513
to television,

3112
02:46:57.710 --> 02:47:00.140
but I really think they should abandon that fighting twice in one night.

3113
02:47:00.141 --> 02:47:01.490
I think it's fucking dangerous.

3114
02:47:01.910 --> 02:47:03.830
<v 3>That's the worst thing in your brain.
He's double concussions.</v>

3115
02:47:04.130 --> 02:47:04.640
So you've got to come,

3116
02:47:04.640 --> 02:47:07.730
you can still fight on concussion and you're getting your second one so much

3117
02:47:07.731 --> 02:47:08.530
worse for your brain.

3118
02:47:08.530 --> 02:47:11.710
<v 0>And it's not even if one guy got a concussion in the first round of their,</v>

3119
02:47:11.711 --> 02:47:14.170
their fight fought two more rounds was like out of it.

3120
02:47:14.290 --> 02:47:17.920
And then an hour later it's got a fight in the final match and the other guy won

3121
02:47:17.921 --> 02:47:21.340
his first fight with one punch.
He didn't receive any damage at all.

3122
02:47:21.580 --> 02:47:22.900
Just because you know,

3123
02:47:22.930 --> 02:47:26.440
they both had to fight doesn't mean that it's an even situation going into the

3124
02:47:26.441 --> 02:47:28.090
final fight.
It's absolutely not even,

3125
02:47:28.210 --> 02:47:30.340
which makes it kind of interesting for the folks at home.

3126
02:47:30.550 --> 02:47:33.160
But I think when you're dealing with the highest level of combat athletes,

3127
02:47:33.161 --> 02:47:34.840
it's a disservice to them.
Make them

3128
02:47:35.120 --> 02:47:36.940
<v 3>like hi and a half to do that on ultimate fighter.
I mean,</v>

3129
02:47:36.941 --> 02:47:40.000
you do get longer breaks,
but man,
it's crunched into six weeks.

3130
02:47:40.750 --> 02:47:43.590
If you go into a fight and get cut,
you might not,

3131
02:47:43.920 --> 02:47:47.530
they might not even let you fight,
you know,
like,
you know,
it's,
it's,
uh,
it's,

3132
02:47:47.531 --> 02:47:50.500
everything's got to work together for that show too.
I mean,
not always.

3133
02:47:50.501 --> 02:47:53.830
The best athlete wins that show because of so many x factors going into the

3134
02:47:53.880 --> 02:47:57.900
<v 0>fight.
Yeah.
And hand injuries and they just go back to a game planning as well.</v>

3135
02:47:58.270 --> 02:48:00.310
The first couple of rounds or first couple of fights and I said,

3136
02:48:00.320 --> 02:48:03.550
lay not showing to put everything out of the toolbox is fighting.

3137
02:48:03.551 --> 02:48:05.550
It was just say fights to see what to the end.
You know,

3138
02:48:05.551 --> 02:48:09.290
one of the kids on this season,
ultimate fighter,
uh,
I think,

3139
02:48:09.640 --> 02:48:11.700
how do you pronounce the last name?
Spawn.
Oh,

3140
02:48:11.701 --> 02:48:13.810
the kid to have the good knockout to get in the house.

3141
02:48:13.920 --> 02:48:14.910
Good knock out to get in the house.

3142
02:48:14.911 --> 02:48:18.090
And then he had a second fight and just wiped very conservatively and people

3143
02:48:18.091 --> 02:48:20.370
were just going crazy and booing him and getting mad at him.

3144
02:48:20.371 --> 02:48:22.260
And Dana said it was one of the worst fights it's ever seen.

3145
02:48:23.070 --> 02:48:24.030
Do you have a problem with that?

3146
02:48:24.060 --> 02:48:27.930
Does that drive you nuts when you know the actual scenario inside the house,

3147
02:48:27.931 --> 02:48:30.750
you know that you have to get through that and this idea that you're supposed to

3148
02:48:30.751 --> 02:48:32.520
throw caution to the wind and your future,

3149
02:48:32.790 --> 02:48:35.470
there's throw it on a whim just to make it more exciting.

3150
02:48:35.750 --> 02:48:39.300
<v 3>Yeah,
I mean the guy is smart.
He's looking towards the future is really smart.</v>

3151
02:48:39.301 --> 02:48:41.310
I mean,
you know,
a lot of people don't look at it that way.

3152
02:48:41.311 --> 02:48:44.060
They don't realize how the Fao Fastest show his filmed.

3153
02:48:44.061 --> 02:48:47.190
It's filling in six weeks.
You fight a week later,
most likely.

3154
02:48:47.191 --> 02:48:49.050
Sometimes you'll get a little bit longer break,

3155
02:48:49.051 --> 02:48:53.810
but my last two fights within five days of each other.
It's crazy.
Yeah.

3156
02:48:54.010 --> 02:48:54.410
Yeah.

3157
02:48:54.410 --> 02:48:56.210
<v 0>It's crazy.
It's incredibly difficult to do.</v>

3158
02:48:56.211 --> 02:48:59.700
And in any other situation it probably likely wouldn't get sanctioned.
No.
Yeah.

3159
02:48:59.760 --> 02:49:00.410
Call.
You know,

3160
02:49:00.410 --> 02:49:03.830
if you were fighting in the UFC and you fought a three round hard fight and then

3161
02:49:03.831 --> 02:49:06.560
they said,
oh,
there's going to fight another three on a hard fight in a week,

3162
02:49:06.920 --> 02:49:08.760
he'd be like,
he's going to what?
Yeah.

3163
02:49:08.880 --> 02:49:11.010
Can you imagine if somebody from this past weekend,

3164
02:49:11.160 --> 02:49:12.600
let's pick a fight or Damien Maia.

3165
02:49:12.601 --> 02:49:16.560
Damien Maia had a three round scrap this past weekend.
If he had to go,

3166
02:49:16.740 --> 02:49:18.930
and you know,
this week someone fell out and they said,
well,

3167
02:49:18.931 --> 02:49:20.820
Damien Maia is going to fight this weekend in Vegas.
You'd be like,

3168
02:49:20.821 --> 02:49:22.200
what the fuck are you talking about?

3169
02:49:22.470 --> 02:49:24.510
The Vegas Athletic Commission would be like the fuck he is,

3170
02:49:24.960 --> 02:49:29.130
but somehow or another on a,
an extended show where it's a tournament format,

3171
02:49:29.280 --> 02:49:32.910
like glory,
they're going to fight in a night.
That's right.
That's nuts.

3172
02:49:33.210 --> 02:49:34.740
They wouldn't let you fight the next day,

3173
02:49:34.741 --> 02:49:36.990
but they'll let you fight an hour later and no matter what,

3174
02:49:37.020 --> 02:49:40.290
no matter how the fight goes,
even if you win like easily,

3175
02:49:40.410 --> 02:49:42.240
he still gets suspended 30 45 days.

3176
02:49:42.430 --> 02:49:46.110
I don't know how the fuck is a guy fighting a two round war,

3177
02:49:46.111 --> 02:49:48.930
three round war and kickboxing and then going to fight again.

3178
02:49:49.260 --> 02:49:52.370
Then I guess that goes back to how they used to have like 12 round seal

3179
02:49:52.440 --> 02:49:55.620
kickboxing matches and then we separate 15 round boxes go and then just breaking

3180
02:49:55.621 --> 02:49:58.950
it up.
It's a pair of the same format is,
but it's not because you,

3181
02:49:58.951 --> 02:50:00.840
you're never getting cold brakes.
Yeah.
Yeah.

3182
02:50:00.841 --> 02:50:03.600
That break when you get cold and everything chills out.
Right?
Yeah.

3183
02:50:04.020 --> 02:50:06.900
That's a terrible,
I fought three times.
The only time I ever fought kickboxing.

3184
02:50:06.901 --> 02:50:08.280
I fought three times in one night.
Oh Wow.

3185
02:50:08.490 --> 02:50:12.690
And I had an hour between the second fight and the third fight and you try to

3186
02:50:13.020 --> 02:50:16.380
fire up again.
You've already fought twice that day.
You're beating the fuck down.

3187
02:50:16.381 --> 02:50:19.190
That's a wrestling tournament.
It's very hard.
You've got yeah,
aspect.

3188
02:50:19.200 --> 02:50:22.110
Also the wrestling tournament though,
the only difference being that wrestling,

3189
02:50:22.111 --> 02:50:23.190
you're not taking head blows.

3190
02:50:23.460 --> 02:50:27.480
I worry about guys and glory getting concussed in the first round and then

3191
02:50:27.481 --> 02:50:30.060
making it through somehow and then fighting in the finals and getting your head

3192
02:50:30.061 --> 02:50:32.940
kicked into oblivion.
You know?
I really do worry about that.

3193
02:50:32.941 --> 02:50:36.120
I just don't think it's the right way.
I think they've got such a great thing.

3194
02:50:36.240 --> 02:50:38.940
They're putting high level kickboxing on TV.
You're getting,

3195
02:50:38.941 --> 02:50:40.830
you see all these Moyie Thai grades,

3196
02:50:40.950 --> 02:50:44.310
you're getting to see all these like amazing,
amazing fighters and fights,

3197
02:50:44.670 --> 02:50:48.630
but the situation with a tournament I just think is archaic.

3198
02:50:49.080 --> 02:50:50.550
I think they didn't need to abandon that shit.

3199
02:50:50.820 --> 02:50:53.500
It's just tickle fights each night.
So more to tournament MMA.

3200
02:50:53.501 --> 02:50:56.130
You just know mean when they used to do that shit and pride and they should do

3201
02:50:56.131 --> 02:50:59.650
that shit in the UFC.
Even playing fields.
I liked that better for sure.
Yeah.
Yeah.

3202
02:50:59.730 --> 02:51:01.680
We must people in terms it shouldn't win them.
No,

3203
02:51:01.740 --> 02:51:04.200
I shouldn't say shouldn't want them,
but they shouldn't win them.
You're you.

3204
02:51:04.470 --> 02:51:08.550
You're right.
It's there.
Shouldn't win them.
It's not fair.
It's,
it's too crazy.

3205
02:51:08.551 --> 02:51:11.910
It's like,
yes,
it's interesting.
Yes.
It's entertaining.
Yes.
It's fascinating.

3206
02:51:11.940 --> 02:51:16.940
But it's unconscionable knowing what we know now about injuries and about damage

3207
02:51:18.151 --> 02:51:21.630
that a body takes to do that just for entertainment.
It's cause it's not,

3208
02:51:21.660 --> 02:51:25.710
it's not as simple as you're risking all on one fight.
You train for eight weeks,

3209
02:51:25.711 --> 02:51:30.240
boom.
You're in the match.
It's not,
it's two t two fights in a day.
You Poussey

3210
02:51:31.920 --> 02:51:36.690
commentating on hopscotch.
You,
I'm just saying,

3211
02:51:36.810 --> 02:51:38.100
I'm just saying.
Yeah,

3212
02:51:38.130 --> 02:51:40.620
definitely want to take the of safety and belonging to account for sure.

3213
02:51:40.680 --> 02:51:43.520
Duane Ludwig and Tj Dillashaw.
I think we cleaned up a lot of things to think.

3214
02:51:43.530 --> 02:51:48.270

Judging problems,
training problems.
