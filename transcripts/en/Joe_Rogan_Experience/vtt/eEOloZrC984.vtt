<v Speaker 1>the tap too</v>

59
00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:31.060
<v Speaker 1>outrageous.</v>

60
00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:34.630
<v Speaker 1>What you're doing is you're attacking the wrist as well as that.</v>

61
00:01:34.631 --> 00:01:35.464
<v Speaker 1>What it is,</v>

62
00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:39.250
<v Speaker 1>I turn it [inaudible] instead of going like this,</v>

63
00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:40.330
<v Speaker 1>it's just straight up.</v>

64
00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:41.051
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

65
00:01:41.051 --> 00:01:41.770
<v Speaker 1>I see.</v>

66
00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:42.603
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

67
00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:43.390
<v Speaker 1>so you just,</v>

68
00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.320
<v Speaker 1>you have his hand twisted around and he's got no strength to get out of that.</v>

69
00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.020
<v Speaker 1>That way your hands all twisted up like that.</v>

70
00:01:50.021 --> 00:01:51.100
<v Speaker 1>Very hard to get any strength.</v>

71
00:01:51.101 --> 00:01:51.934
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

72
00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:53.133
<v Speaker 1>I won't do it.</v>

73
00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:54.243
<v Speaker 1>He's gonna do it.</v>

74
00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.610
<v Speaker 1>He could put his hand between my legs and a roll me back,</v>

75
00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:02.800
<v Speaker 1>but see that way</v>

76
00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.910
<v Speaker 1>don't let him see you doing that.</v>

77
00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:07.773
<v Speaker 1>It's going to hurt you</v>

78
00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:10.373
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

79
00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:11.463
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to do it.</v>

80
00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.920
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

81
00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:12.753
<v Speaker 1>He's going to do it</v>

82
00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.180
<v Speaker 1>instead of going like this,</v>

83
00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.993
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

84
00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:19.743
<v Speaker 1>you're just go up.</v>

85
00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.430
<v Speaker 1>Is it harder to hold onto it that way?</v>

86
00:02:21.431 --> 00:02:22.264
<v Speaker 1>It seems like,</v>

87
00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.330
<v Speaker 1>especially with a sweaty hand might be a little difficult,</v>

88
00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:27.520
<v Speaker 1>but good for Mae.</v>

89
00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.731
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

90
00:02:27.731 --> 00:02:30.370
<v Speaker 1>If you could get your thumb inside the glove and they don't catch you.</v>

91
00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.280
<v Speaker 1>It depends how big your hand is called.</v>

92
00:02:35.281 --> 00:02:35.531
