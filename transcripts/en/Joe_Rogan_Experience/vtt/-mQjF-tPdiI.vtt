<v Speaker 2>while and at first or first two weeks</v>

27
00:01:16.011 --> 00:01:18.590
<v Speaker 2>the movements were difficult,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>level one stuff,</v>

<v Speaker 2>any age could do it.</v>

30
00:01:21.321 --> 00:01:23.540
<v Speaker 2>If I could do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just laying on the back,</v>

31
00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.590
<v Speaker 2>lifting your hips and spending over on</v>
<v Speaker 2>your toes and doing it back.</v>

32
00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.880
<v Speaker 2>And at first I couldn't even look Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't move my elbows like that.</v>

33
00:01:31.881 --> 00:01:33.080
<v Speaker 2>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My shoulders,</v>

34
00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.080
<v Speaker 2>my wrists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I kept staying for the 30 minute</v>

35
00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.880
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Five exercises,</v>

36
00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.520
<v Speaker 2>three minutes apiece.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

37
00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.400
<v Speaker 2>No drama.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could be big,</v>

38
00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:45.800
<v Speaker 2>heavy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all stuff I could do.</v>

39
00:01:45.801 --> 00:01:49.310
<v Speaker 2>Picking up your leg,</v>
<v Speaker 2>putting it on body weight or body</v>

40
00:01:49.311 --> 00:01:50.660
<v Speaker 2>weight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff that I can handle.</v>

41
00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.570
<v Speaker 2>If I can handle it on my risk being 300</v>
<v Speaker 2>pounds,</v>

42
00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.700
<v Speaker 2>anybody can handle it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Simple stuff.</v>

43
00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.460
<v Speaker 2>And one day I was getting caught and</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

44
00:01:58.461 --> 00:02:01.380
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guy was pulling me into his guard</v>

45
00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:06.400
<v Speaker 2>and magically my hips flew up and I just</v>
<v Speaker 2>mysteriously gotten to site control and</v>

46
00:02:07.011 --> 00:02:08.900
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something made me look up and Alberto</v>

47
00:02:08.901 --> 00:02:12.530
<v Speaker 2>cranes jaw dropped and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's from doing that stuff.</v>

48
00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:14.840
<v Speaker 2>You couldn't do that when you walked in</v>
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>

49
00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.480
<v Speaker 2>But I kept going to these 30 minute</v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.090
<v Speaker 2>Thirty minute five exercises,</v>

69
00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.490
<v Speaker 4>cloud that CSD,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

70
00:03:06.491 --> 00:03:09.310
<v Speaker 4>we meet each other a long time ago in</v>
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] 94 and then,</v>

71
00:03:09.311 --> 00:03:12.430
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was doing contractor work that's worth</v>

72
00:03:12.431 --> 00:03:15.790
<v Speaker 4>my time of businesses design.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've always been involved in training</v>

73
00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:19.360
<v Speaker 4>martial art and any kind of training and</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

74
00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.410
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or the injury that got for competing and</v>

75
00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:28.610
<v Speaker 4>normal weight lifting and I'd been lost</v>
<v Speaker 4>contact with him for a few years and</v>

76
00:03:29.321 --> 00:03:32.890
<v Speaker 4>then I saw him in 2000 and coming out</v>
<v Speaker 4>with the clubbers club has really</v>

77
00:03:32.891 --> 00:03:35.950
<v Speaker 4>attracted me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was a different tools and I say,</v>

78
00:03:35.951 --> 00:03:36.430
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want,</v>

79
00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:37.840
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll give you bake in concert with these</v>

80
00:03:37.841 --> 00:03:40.060
<v Speaker 4>guys.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to understand how can they,</v>

81
00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:43.630
<v Speaker 4>can help it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I went back to him and he blew my</v>

82
00:03:43.631 --> 00:03:46.150
<v Speaker 4>mind,</v>
<v Speaker 4>blew my mind and helped me to get back</v>

83
00:03:46.151 --> 00:03:48.700
<v Speaker 4>into the best shape of my life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

84
00:03:48.701 --> 00:03:52.390
<v Speaker 4>I feel now in 47 feet I can move better</v>
<v Speaker 4>and do better than I used to do it when</v>

85
00:03:52.391 --> 00:03:53.224
<v Speaker 4>I was 20.</v>

86
00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:55.300
<v Speaker 4>So I promised him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

87
00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:58.910
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to make these things happen in</v>
<v Speaker 4>Europe or you want me,</v>

88
00:03:58.911 --> 00:04:00.280
<v Speaker 4>my coach,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you changed my fee,</v>

89
00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.020
<v Speaker 4>my way to see fitness and I got to do</v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

90
00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.130
<v Speaker 4>So between my job and security I was</v>
<v Speaker 4>introducing this to my teams,</v>

91
00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.430
<v Speaker 4>to my teams and then I see changing on</v>
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>

92
00:04:09.431 --> 00:04:12.700
<v Speaker 4>people being able even to just to go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>moving easier,</v>

93
00:04:12.701 --> 00:04:16.810
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then transfer to whatever it was,</v>

94
00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:21.250
<v Speaker 4>our training and Ghana or wherever</v>
<v Speaker 4>skiers and stop everything was easier.</v>

95
00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:25.180
<v Speaker 4>So I start to believe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>start to believe basically,</v>

96
00:04:25.181 --> 00:04:26.800
<v Speaker 4>and I start to say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

97
00:04:26.801 --> 00:04:31.540
<v Speaker 4>I want to help more people that I can in</v>
<v Speaker 4>my line of duty in the army because I</v>

98
00:04:31.541 --> 00:04:36.520
<v Speaker 4>still don't have a different contract as</v>
<v Speaker 4>a consultant in the army.</v>

99
00:04:36.521 --> 00:04:39.890
<v Speaker 4>Back home has a physical trainer and</v>
<v Speaker 4>some time out.</v>

100
00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:44.830
<v Speaker 4>So non combat training and I start to</v>
<v Speaker 4>introduce these things from barely cry</v>

101
00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:47.210
<v Speaker 4>because the system is very complex as</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were.</v>

102
00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:49.270
<v Speaker 4>Joe was talking about is all the</v>
<v Speaker 4>mobility.</v>

103
00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:51.070
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mobility is a big.</v>

104
00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:54.410
<v Speaker 3>It's a big factor because there's for so</v>
<v Speaker 3>long,</v>

105
00:04:54.411 --> 00:04:57.590
<v Speaker 3>people have just been concentrating on</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting stronger or getting in great</v>

106
00:04:57.591 --> 00:04:58.560
<v Speaker 3>shape,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I,</v>

107
00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:00.320
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know people that are in fantastic</v>

108
00:05:00.321 --> 00:05:01.340
<v Speaker 3>shape,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can run forever,</v>

109
00:05:01.341 --> 00:05:03.700
<v Speaker 3>but they could barely touch their toes</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you,</v>

110
00:05:03.701 --> 00:05:05.600
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you developed these bodies that are</v>

111
00:05:05.601 --> 00:05:09.380
<v Speaker 3>severely limited in the amount of motion</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you can actually get out of your</v>

112
00:05:09.381 --> 00:05:11.960
<v Speaker 3>body in certain motions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're really good.</v>

113
00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:12.710
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could,</v>

114
00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:14.300
<v Speaker 3>you might be explosive with a bench</v>
<v Speaker 3>press,</v>

115
00:05:14.301 --> 00:05:15.860
<v Speaker 3>you might,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you might have a great run,</v>

116
00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:18.740
<v Speaker 3>but whatever else you're doing to your</v>
<v Speaker 3>body,</v>

117
00:05:18.741 --> 00:05:21.560
<v Speaker 3>you're compromising all of your overall</v>
<v Speaker 3>mobility.</v>

118
00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:25.340
<v Speaker 3>So over the last few years has been a</v>
<v Speaker 3>tremendous amount of concentration and</v>

119
00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:28.220
<v Speaker 3>effort by a bunch of different trainers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kelly start,</v>

120
00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:29.840
<v Speaker 3>he's a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's done a lot.</v>

121
00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:33.380
<v Speaker 3>Kelly's done a lot of work and his book</v>
<v Speaker 3>becoming a supple Leopard.</v>

122
00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:38.520
<v Speaker 3>Excellent book on that and Kelly has a</v>
<v Speaker 3>great instagram you can follow to and</v>

123
00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:42.290
<v Speaker 3>what he's done is he's done an amazing</v>
<v Speaker 3>job in highlighting mobility and how</v>

124
00:05:42.291 --> 00:05:45.410
<v Speaker 3>important mobility and just having a</v>
<v Speaker 3>full range of motion,</v>

125
00:05:45.411 --> 00:05:48.530
<v Speaker 3>which seems so simple,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not something that most people</v>

126
00:05:48.531 --> 00:05:51.320
<v Speaker 3>really concentrate on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most people are concentrating on getting</v>

127
00:05:51.321 --> 00:05:52.950
<v Speaker 3>stronger,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more deadlift,</v>

128
00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:54.410
<v Speaker 3>more bench press,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more this,</v>

129
00:05:54.411 --> 00:05:56.300
<v Speaker 3>more that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're compromising all of these</v>

130
00:05:56.301 --> 00:05:58.280
<v Speaker 3>different areas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your body absolutely</v>

131
00:05:58.280 --> 00:05:58.870
<v Speaker 5>agree with you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's,</v>

132
00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:00.450
<v Speaker 5>that's from the right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right there.</v>

133
00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:04.600
<v Speaker 5>This ball,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that ball right there is the um,</v>

134
00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:05.780
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's one of those,</v>

135
00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:08.210
<v Speaker 5>I think he calls it the Wad.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Supernova.</v>

136
00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:10.010
<v Speaker 5>Supernovas.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I got that one too.</v>

137
00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:13.560
<v Speaker 5>It seems like nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But when you roll around and find this</v>

138
00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:15.530
<v Speaker 5>spot,</v>
<v Speaker 5>release tension on your Fascia.</v>

139
00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:17.810
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>put that on the ground.</v>

140
00:06:17.811 --> 00:06:21.920
<v Speaker 5>And I do like bridges on it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I lie on my back on it and I put all my</v>

141
00:06:21.921 --> 00:06:24.590
<v Speaker 5>weight on that ball for people just</v>
<v Speaker 5>listening.</v>

142
00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:29.950
<v Speaker 5>It's a rubber ball that's like the size</v>
<v Speaker 5>of a softball and it's really hard and</v>

143
00:06:30.051 --> 00:06:32.150
<v Speaker 5>it's got like this textured outer</v>
<v Speaker 5>surface.</v>

144
00:06:32.151 --> 00:06:34.140
<v Speaker 5>And Kelly developed this to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

145
00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:37.130
<v Speaker 5>to help you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He also uses lacrosse balls.</v>

146
00:06:37.131 --> 00:06:39.230
<v Speaker 5>That's what I start out with.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But then I think that's a little bit</v>

147
00:06:39.231 --> 00:06:42.770
<v Speaker 5>better than a Lacrosse ball.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I take one of those everywhere with me</v>

148
00:06:42.771 --> 00:06:43.580
<v Speaker 5>on the road.</v>

149
00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:46.250
<v Speaker 5>Every time I go in a hotel room that</v>
<v Speaker 5>goes in my bag period.</v>

150
00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:48.980
<v Speaker 5>Like there's no.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because if I work out I get stiff.</v>

151
00:06:48.981 --> 00:06:51.620
<v Speaker 5>If I got something locked up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I need that fucking thing.</v>

152
00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:55.970
<v Speaker 5>That's what I have to in my bag because</v>
<v Speaker 5>it will to travel and flight flight.</v>

153
00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:00.450
<v Speaker 5>My deaf friends being back,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my lower back have the same problem.</v>

154
00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:03.080
<v Speaker 5>I find those links.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Went to St.</v>

155
00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:04.400
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like say Joe,</v>

156
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.000
<v Speaker 5>what is the bodies were the things years</v>
<v Speaker 5>ago to take a unit of my community,</v>

157
00:07:10.821 --> 00:07:12.290
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>working with the army or stuff like</v>

158
00:07:12.291 --> 00:07:12.801
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They say,</v>

159
00:07:12.801 --> 00:07:14.120
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're going to do mobility.</v>

160
00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:17.390
<v Speaker 5>They will look at you like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do we really need that?</v>

161
00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:18.580
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the old tough guy,</v>

162
00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:21.620
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the old thinking about need something to</v>

163
00:07:21.621 --> 00:07:23.720
<v Speaker 5>get myself stronger and faster.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

164
00:07:23.721 --> 00:07:25.910
<v Speaker 5>But they don't get it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They don't get a few who don't allow</v>

165
00:07:25.911 --> 00:07:27.950
<v Speaker 5>yourself to regain their mobility.</v>

166
00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:29.780
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They used to push to have.</v>

167
00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:33.370
<v Speaker 5>At one point you're going to be stuck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're going to be reaching blood door,</v>

168
00:07:33.371 --> 00:07:36.080
<v Speaker 5>you're going to get injured and you're</v>
<v Speaker 5>going to lose those guys in the field.</v>

169
00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:40.820
<v Speaker 5>That was my point and I think the system</v>
<v Speaker 5>that this got created was smart enough</v>

170
00:07:40.821 --> 00:07:41.654
<v Speaker 5>to say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know what?</v>

171
00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:46.790
<v Speaker 5>I got introduced this slowly underneath</v>
<v Speaker 5>because they give you this amount of</v>

172
00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:50.420
<v Speaker 5>mobility that I w what you want when you</v>
<v Speaker 5>want to have that intensity workout,</v>

173
00:07:50.421 --> 00:07:51.980
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>should I give you that I intend to do</v>

174
00:07:51.981 --> 00:07:53.630
<v Speaker 5>about that doctorate,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I intensity,</v>

175
00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:58.280
<v Speaker 5>but you're going to teach you how to</v>
<v Speaker 5>recover for the poor performance faster,</v>

176
00:07:58.730 --> 00:08:00.320
<v Speaker 5>and then I get introduced to Libya of</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yoga,</v>

177
00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:02.150
<v Speaker 5>so you're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Feel better.</v>

178
00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:04.600
<v Speaker 5>Loosen up when you live in and day by</v>
<v Speaker 5>day,</v>

179
00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:07.360
<v Speaker 5>those guys,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they on understood and they started</v>

180
00:08:07.361 --> 00:08:08.194
<v Speaker 5>telling me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know what?</v>

181
00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:11.810
<v Speaker 5>We like the workout,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but what we feel we need to be able to</v>

182
00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:16.010
<v Speaker 5>move the shoot that again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to be able to carry a backpack again and</v>

183
00:08:16.011 --> 00:08:19.520
<v Speaker 5>now everybody wants to do mobility more</v>
<v Speaker 5>than workout because you can kill</v>

184
00:08:19.521 --> 00:08:22.140
<v Speaker 5>yourself in the workout.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't even need to kill.</v>

185
00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:27.230
<v Speaker 5>You just throw the days and decide to be</v>
<v Speaker 5>a push up and that they don't need to</v>

186
00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:30.570
<v Speaker 5>really someone to drive you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Here.</v>

187
00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:32.650
<v Speaker 5>People are understanding now that it's</v>
<v Speaker 5>a.</v>

188
00:08:32.651 --> 00:08:35.600
<v Speaker 5>it's a huge deal and yoga is huge.</v>
<v Speaker 5>For me.</v>

189
00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:39.440
<v Speaker 5>That's one of the reasons why I still</v>
<v Speaker 5>use that Supernova ball,</v>

190
00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:43.070
<v Speaker 5>but man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yoga has had a tremendous effect on my</v>

191
00:08:43.071 --> 00:08:44.840
<v Speaker 5>back.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is that a tremendous effects on</v>

192
00:08:44.841 --> 00:08:46.910
<v Speaker 5>everything?</v>
<v Speaker 5>My overall flexibility is better than</v>

193
00:08:46.911 --> 00:08:50.630
<v Speaker 5>it's been in a long time since I was a</v>
<v Speaker 5>kid and I just feel better.</v>

194
00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:52.980
<v Speaker 5>Just feels like everything moves better,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

195
00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:56.460
<v Speaker 5>But you say yoga to and they go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>ah,</v>

<v Speaker 6>something they need to improve on?</v>

<v Speaker 6>feet strength.</v>

<v Speaker 6>Nobody says that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Everybody's like,</v>

219
00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:02.340
<v Speaker 6>work on your cardio,</v>
<v Speaker 6>work on your explosiveness.</v>

<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

221
00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:05.790
<v Speaker 6>fucking throw more kettle bells around.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He was like,</v>

222
00:10:05.791 --> 00:10:07.920
<v Speaker 6>your feet,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like you think about it,</v>

<v Speaker 6>your emotion,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like if you can't move out of the way or</v>

224

<v Speaker 6>towards your opponent,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're useless.</v>

225
00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:14.910
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>If your foot's broken in a fight,</v>

226
00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:19.440
<v Speaker 6>you're severely limited and one of the</v>
<v Speaker 6>things that I found out almost instantly</v>

227
00:10:19.441 --> 00:10:21.240
<v Speaker 6>when I started doing yoga and when I</v>
<v Speaker 6>started skiing,</v>

228
00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:23.910
<v Speaker 6>my fucking feet would be killing me in</v>
<v Speaker 6>the beginning.</v>

229
00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:28.380
<v Speaker 6>Skiing was because my boots were too</v>
<v Speaker 6>small because I have really wide feet so</v>

230
00:10:28.390 --> 00:10:32.580
<v Speaker 6>my feet would be smashed in there and it</v>
<v Speaker 6>sucked and I was like,</v>

231
00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:33.840
<v Speaker 6>well fuck skiing.</v>

232
00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:35.140
<v Speaker 6>I can't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>My feet are too wide.</v>

233
00:10:35.170 --> 00:10:38.580
<v Speaker 6>Then I got boots that are made for a</v>
<v Speaker 6>wider feet and they fit,</v>

234
00:10:38.581 --> 00:10:40.260
<v Speaker 6>but my feet would still hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 6>After awhile I was like,</v>

235
00:10:40.261 --> 00:10:42.030
<v Speaker 6>what the fuck is wrong with my damn</v>
<v Speaker 6>feet?</v>

236
00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:44.730
<v Speaker 6>Maybe it's just because my feet are flat</v>
<v Speaker 6>and I'm just going to have to deal with</v>

237
00:10:44.731 --> 00:10:45.564
<v Speaker 6>that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No.</v>

238
00:10:45.890 --> 00:10:48.060
<v Speaker 6>As soon as I started doing yoga,</v>
<v Speaker 6>now I can ski all day.</v>

239
00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:50.820
<v Speaker 6>It doesn't bother me at all.</v>
<v Speaker 6>As long as I'm doing yoga twice a week,</v>

240
00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:54.180
<v Speaker 6>all that foot problems are gone.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're out the window because a</v>

241
00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:56.340
<v Speaker 6>balance.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's pretty funny because I was watching</v>

242
00:10:56.341 --> 00:11:00.060
<v Speaker 6>you flow video the other night right</v>
<v Speaker 6>before I came on because I didn't have.</v>

243
00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:03.960
<v Speaker 6>I wanted to be able to contribute in</v>
<v Speaker 6>this conversation.</v>

244
00:11:03.961 --> 00:11:08.130
<v Speaker 6>You guys are to level genius for me,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so if you want just flow video.</v>

245
00:11:08.131 --> 00:11:11.760
<v Speaker 6>The first thing he put on some shoes</v>
<v Speaker 6>with toes with them and you're talking</v>

246
00:11:11.761 --> 00:11:14.010
<v Speaker 6>about the feet.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's before you do anything.</v>

247
00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:17.580
<v Speaker 6>He started stretching his feet and I</v>
<v Speaker 6>could see him playing with his toes and</v>

248
00:11:17.590 --> 00:11:18.211
<v Speaker 6>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

249
00:11:18.211 --> 00:11:22.400
<v Speaker 6>I guess this is the.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think it was going to say and it's</v>

250
00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:25.860
<v Speaker 6>saying this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but this has got to be just pulled</v>

251
00:11:25.861 --> 00:11:27.910
<v Speaker 6>around and be great.</v>

252
00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:29.150
<v Speaker 4>Is there anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

253
00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:31.680
<v Speaker 4>Everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everybody don't think about it because</v>

254
00:11:31.710 --> 00:11:34.410
<v Speaker 4>we stand in our fit so we think we're</v>
<v Speaker 4>connected to the earth.</v>

255
00:11:34.490 --> 00:11:37.860
<v Speaker 4>We are not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We just post this one on the table but</v>

256
00:11:37.861 --> 00:11:39.930
<v Speaker 4>he's not connected and move around,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it has no control.</v>

257
00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:44.520
<v Speaker 4>We're building the capability to grow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>grabbing the ground,</v>

258
00:11:44.710 --> 00:11:47.640
<v Speaker 4>understand the stability of the food,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the mobility of the tours,</v>

259
00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:52.110
<v Speaker 4>and the ankle mobility is mandatory</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I'm going to transfer power</v>

260
00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:54.010
<v Speaker 4>through my fit engagement to the</v>

261
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:54.850
<v Speaker 6>ground,</v>
<v Speaker 6>to my leg,</v>

262
00:11:54.851 --> 00:11:57.940
<v Speaker 6>drive to my hips to enter my core.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So everything comes from the hurt.</v>

263
00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:00.930
<v Speaker 6>These shoes make everybody look gay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

264
00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:02.800
<v Speaker 6>yeah man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's no way around the shoes.</v>

265
00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:05.110
<v Speaker 6>I love them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're very functional,</v>

266
00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:10.140
<v Speaker 6>but they're not sexy at all.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I will never get married with us.</v>

267
00:12:12.490 --> 00:12:15.340
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I always know the real weirdos when I</v>

268
00:12:15.341 --> 00:12:17.080
<v Speaker 6>catch them out at night and they're</v>
<v Speaker 6>wearing them,</v>

269
00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:19.060
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you catch a guy like at a bar and</v>

270
00:12:19.061 --> 00:12:20.860
<v Speaker 6>he's wearing those shoes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's a real weirdo.</v>

271
00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:23.480
<v Speaker 6>But there's people that do wear though.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Is that your gym?</v>

272
00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:25.600
<v Speaker 6>What gym is that?</v>
<v Speaker 6>My exec said Jim.</v>

273
00:12:25.601 --> 00:12:27.610
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>As the gym that I'm dealing with,</v>

274
00:12:27.650 --> 00:12:30.220
<v Speaker 6>I'm working with in Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's the,</v>

275
00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:33.030
<v Speaker 6>that's my headquarters say in Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So it's a,</v>

276
00:12:33.130 --> 00:12:35.110
<v Speaker 6>it's my dream.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So this is all what we're looking at</v>

277
00:12:35.111 --> 00:12:36.490
<v Speaker 6>here.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What's the name of this video?</v>

278
00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:38.290
<v Speaker 6>Jamie?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Flow fit,</v>

279
00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:39.341
<v Speaker 6>flow,</v>
<v Speaker 6>fit,</v>

280
00:12:39.341 --> 00:12:40.690
<v Speaker 6>tactic.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Flow fit.</v>

281
00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:42.130
<v Speaker 6>Alberto.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Gutsy.</v>

282
00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:46.390
<v Speaker 6>Vibram five fingers,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so you sponsored by Vibram or I'm an.</v>

283
00:12:46.391 --> 00:12:50.320
<v Speaker 6>I'm an ambassador for them and I'm a and</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's a very low profile one.</v>

284
00:12:50.321 --> 00:12:53.320
<v Speaker 6>It has a very small amount of tread at</v>
<v Speaker 6>the bottom of it.</v>

285
00:12:53.321 --> 00:12:54.250
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's very thin.</v>

286
00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:56.200
<v Speaker 6>The one that you've got on because there</v>
<v Speaker 6>are different,</v>

287
00:12:56.201 --> 00:12:57.340
<v Speaker 6>different type,</v>
<v Speaker 6>different types.</v>

288
00:12:57.341 --> 00:13:01.800
<v Speaker 6>Some of them are for trail running.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I tried to work with them to,</v>

289
00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:04.300
<v Speaker 6>to,</v>
<v Speaker 6>to realize something specifically for</v>

290
00:13:04.430 --> 00:13:07.660
<v Speaker 6>flow because sometime when they have</v>
<v Speaker 6>uber on the side.</v>

291
00:13:07.950 --> 00:13:09.460
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so specifically flow.</v>

292
00:13:09.461 --> 00:13:13.150
<v Speaker 6>Especially if we want to focus on your</v>
<v Speaker 6>knee and understanding of my knee and my</v>

293
00:13:13.151 --> 00:13:15.190
<v Speaker 6>hips work,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they get too much friction.</v>

294
00:13:15.310 --> 00:13:18.160
<v Speaker 6>So why do you use that instead of a</v>
<v Speaker 6>barefoot?</v>

295
00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:19.580
<v Speaker 6>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I have to donate it.</v>

296
00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:24.310
<v Speaker 6>Like you felt you wanted to really go</v>
<v Speaker 6>freestyle and move around.</v>

297
00:13:24.310 --> 00:13:27.220
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I go freestyle go barefoot,</v>

298
00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:28.820
<v Speaker 6>but food,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's no traction but some.</v>

299
00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:30.293
<v Speaker 6>But it's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

300
00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:32.620
<v Speaker 6>if I train them like a Doosan time in</v>
<v Speaker 6>the concrete,</v>

301
00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:37.660
<v Speaker 6>I need somebody to really protect them</v>
<v Speaker 6>in dirt and rocks and stuff.</v>

302
00:13:37.661 --> 00:13:39.370
<v Speaker 6>Like that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Years ago you told me one of your</v>

303
00:13:39.371 --> 00:13:43.150
<v Speaker 6>biggest failures was getting old and</v>
<v Speaker 6>feeling weak,</v>

304
00:13:43.270 --> 00:13:45.640
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and then you and I traveled a lot</v>

305
00:13:45.641 --> 00:13:46.630
<v Speaker 6>together.</v>
<v Speaker 6>A lot of places.</v>

306
00:13:46.631 --> 00:13:50.440
<v Speaker 6>We would go to Jujitsu places and we'd</v>
<v Speaker 6>see the Jujitsu Guy,</v>

307
00:13:50.441 --> 00:13:53.140
<v Speaker 6>the main guy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and he'd be walking a little funny.</v>

308
00:13:53.570 --> 00:13:55.690
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're all fucked up or he be.</v>

309
00:13:55.691 --> 00:13:59.570
<v Speaker 6>And that always stuck out,</v>
<v Speaker 6>stuck out in my mind like why love</v>

310
00:13:59.571 --> 00:14:04.210
<v Speaker 6>something so much in my sixties,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to be limping or walking</v>

311
00:14:04.211 --> 00:14:08.410
<v Speaker 6>different and I think this is maybe the</v>
<v Speaker 6>so help.</v>

312
00:14:08.411 --> 00:14:11.020
<v Speaker 6>That definitely helped that I think.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

313
00:14:11.021 --> 00:14:13.720
<v Speaker 6>that's one of the reasons why it has</v>
<v Speaker 6>gotten so into yoga too and he's doing</v>

314
00:14:13.721 --> 00:14:17.440
<v Speaker 6>yoga three times a week now and he</v>
<v Speaker 6>realizes that after he had back surgery,</v>

315
00:14:17.930 --> 00:14:18.460
<v Speaker 6>you know what I mean?</v>

316
00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:20.950
<v Speaker 6>Once you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when people get older in particular,</v>

317
00:14:20.951 --> 00:14:23.680
<v Speaker 6>you start realizing the limitations of</v>
<v Speaker 6>some of the things that you're doing.</v>

318
00:14:23.681 --> 00:14:26.860
<v Speaker 6>You're putting tremendous stress on your</v>
<v Speaker 6>body in very specific areas,</v>

319
00:14:26.861 --> 00:14:29.320
<v Speaker 6>especially Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're attacking the joints all the</v>

320
00:14:29.321 --> 00:14:30.820
<v Speaker 6>time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're attacking the joints,</v>

321
00:14:30.821 --> 00:14:33.910
<v Speaker 6>you're attacking your neck and almost</v>
<v Speaker 6>everybody that I know either has a back</v>

322
00:14:33.911 --> 00:14:36.580
<v Speaker 6>problem or some sort of a knee problem</v>
<v Speaker 6>or a neck problem.</v>

323
00:14:36.610 --> 00:14:41.230
<v Speaker 6>It's just a constant issue when it comes</v>
<v Speaker 6>to Jujitsu and I feel like the only way</v>

324
00:14:41.231 --> 00:14:43.840
<v Speaker 6>to mitigate that as first of all roll</v>
<v Speaker 6>with people that you know,</v>

325
00:14:44.050 --> 00:14:45.970
<v Speaker 6>like people that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're good people.</v>

326
00:14:45.971 --> 00:14:48.340
<v Speaker 6>They're not going to try to hurt you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're not crazy.</v>

327
00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:52.010
<v Speaker 6>It's not even their fault,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but young people in could get like some</v>

328
00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:57.010
<v Speaker 3>young 20 year old kid is all full of</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking just come and just some little</v>

329
00:14:57.201 --> 00:15:00.500
<v Speaker 3>animal they want to kill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They want to kill a young guy.</v>

330
00:15:00.501 --> 00:15:03.210
<v Speaker 3>When they roll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they roll fucking full clip and you you</v>

331
00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:06.620
<v Speaker 3>could get a knee caught in a scramble</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it gets ripped apart.</v>

332
00:15:06.621 --> 00:15:09.110
<v Speaker 3>It's a super common,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you gotta be real careful.</v>

333
00:15:09.130 --> 00:15:12.530
<v Speaker 3>The kind of people you work out with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>make sure that people aren't gonna Yank</v>

334
00:15:12.531 --> 00:15:14.260
<v Speaker 3>on an arm bar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a knee bar,</v>

335
00:15:14.730 --> 00:15:16.820
<v Speaker 3>he'll hook or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's big,</v>

336
00:15:16.821 --> 00:15:19.490
<v Speaker 3>but also I think that improving your</v>
<v Speaker 3>mobility,</v>

337
00:15:19.491 --> 00:15:20.630
<v Speaker 3>like dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's so many times.</v>

338
00:15:20.631 --> 00:15:25.550
<v Speaker 3>I would go to class and I would be stiff</v>
<v Speaker 3>before I walked in the door right before</v>

339
00:15:25.551 --> 00:15:27.320
<v Speaker 3>I walked in the door.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My back would be fucked up.</v>

340
00:15:27.321 --> 00:15:32.310
<v Speaker 3>I'd get more up in the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My back would be just be stiff and then</v>

341
00:15:32.311 --> 00:15:33.560
<v Speaker 3>it get in there and start warming up.</v>

342
00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:34.910
<v Speaker 3>But Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so fun.</v>

343
00:15:35.210 --> 00:15:38.900
<v Speaker 3>As soon as you get in there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just do a little few movements.</v>

344
00:15:38.901 --> 00:15:42.980
<v Speaker 3>He started coming in on flammatory,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you ready to go?</v>

345
00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:45.890
<v Speaker 3>Next thing you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll like slap hands and you fucking</v>

346
00:15:45.891 --> 00:15:48.590
<v Speaker 3>go into Oregon and then you got a worse</v>
<v Speaker 3>back.</v>

347
00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:50.750
<v Speaker 3>Then you've got a worse name.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how I fucked up my back.</v>

348
00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:53.360
<v Speaker 3>I didn't just fuck it up in one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I had.</v>

349
00:15:53.361 --> 00:15:55.940
<v Speaker 3>That was one incident that had got</v>
<v Speaker 3>injured in,</v>

350
00:15:55.941 --> 00:15:59.330
<v Speaker 3>I could have eventually healed it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What I did was I just kept doing it.</v>

351
00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:01.610
<v Speaker 3>Even when I was still hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would keep God,</v>

352
00:16:01.611 --> 00:16:03.670
<v Speaker 3>God just go light.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never went light.</v>

353
00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:07.430
<v Speaker 3>Still go back in there and go hard again</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then fucks it up more.</v>

354
00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:11.240
<v Speaker 3>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that we have to be super aware</v>

355
00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:16.300
<v Speaker 3>that our body is a precious resource and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got to treat it almost</v>

356
00:16:16.551 --> 00:16:19.040
<v Speaker 3>scientifically instead of looking at it</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

357
00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:21.530
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>guys like to do curls and bench presses</v>

358
00:16:21.531 --> 00:16:23.960
<v Speaker 3>because I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how many times have you seen that where</v>

359
00:16:23.961 --> 00:16:27.350
<v Speaker 3>you see a guy with a meatball upper body</v>
<v Speaker 3>with little toothpick at the bottom</v>

360
00:16:27.351 --> 00:16:29.060
<v Speaker 3>that's holding them up with his legs.</v>

361
00:16:29.690 --> 00:16:31.970
<v Speaker 3>Like you see guys are certain guys you</v>
<v Speaker 3>see at the gym and you go,</v>

362
00:16:31.971 --> 00:16:34.040
<v Speaker 3>you poor bastard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what are you doing to yourself?</v>

363
00:16:34.310 --> 00:16:37.700
<v Speaker 3>Like you think everything looks good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's got these big biceps and big chest,</v>

364
00:16:37.910 --> 00:16:40.130
<v Speaker 3>but your lower body is virtually</v>
<v Speaker 3>useless,</v>

365
00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:41.470
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they don't live.</v>

366
00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:43.790
<v Speaker 3>They don't live with their lower body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't do anything with it.</v>

367
00:16:44.090 --> 00:16:45.610
<v Speaker 3>You don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She got to treat your body like,</v>

368
00:16:45.810 --> 00:16:48.410
<v Speaker 3>like it's a big old science project.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

369
00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:50.720
<v Speaker 3>like the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to look at it scientifically.</v>

370
00:16:51.370 --> 00:16:52.820
<v Speaker 3>What I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When people ask me,</v>

371
00:16:52.821 --> 00:16:54.380
<v Speaker 3>what do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I think,</v>

372
00:16:55.020 --> 00:16:57.830
<v Speaker 3>what is the project that I'm not going</v>
<v Speaker 3>to train you?</v>

373
00:16:58.380 --> 00:16:59.050
<v Speaker 3>I'm thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

374
00:16:59.050 --> 00:17:02.780
<v Speaker 3>it was that everybody of us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we know what is our point b.</v>

375
00:17:02.930 --> 00:17:05.540
<v Speaker 3>So if I asked you when you come to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>gym,</v>

376
00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:07.080
<v Speaker 3>what is Yoga?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most of the,</v>

377
00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:09.300
<v Speaker 3>especially young people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they know I want to be.</v>

378
00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:11.780
<v Speaker 3>Nobody's my point be I want to become a</v>
<v Speaker 3>foster,</v>

379
00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:14.410
<v Speaker 3>a stronger leaner,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever you say,</v>

380
00:17:14.450 --> 00:17:16.850
<v Speaker 3>point b,</v>
<v Speaker 3>point a to point B.</v>

381
00:17:16.890 --> 00:17:18.870
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't really know what is our point</v>

382
00:17:18.890 --> 00:17:21.050
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we think we know what we don't know.</v>

383
00:17:21.051 --> 00:17:26.051
<v Speaker 3>We don't know what's going on inside our</v>
<v Speaker 3>truck about estrogen and testosterone</v>

384
00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:28.850
<v Speaker 3>and cortisol,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

385
00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:32.270
<v Speaker 3>We don't know exactly over the Fascia</v>
<v Speaker 3>has asked me to set up with us.</v>

386
00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:35.920
<v Speaker 3>If you don't think about that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we never going to reach point and oh</v>

387
00:17:35.950 --> 00:17:39.740
<v Speaker 3>probably we're going to reach it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but going zigzag instead to go straight</v>

388
00:17:39.741 --> 00:17:42.930
<v Speaker 3>line and we're going to face in what</v>
<v Speaker 3>injury plateau.</v>

389
00:17:43.230 --> 00:17:44.320
<v Speaker 3>Back to the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

390
00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:47.310
<v Speaker 3>imbalances imbalances.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's why I think the difficult.</v>

391
00:17:47.330 --> 00:17:50.100
<v Speaker 3>Something like yoga is very important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It highlights those</v>

392
00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:52.770
<v Speaker 4>imbalances.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It seems like this kind of particular</v>

393
00:17:52.771 --> 00:17:54.720
<v Speaker 4>motion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like your flow like that up there.</v>

394
00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:57.480
<v Speaker 4>That would also highlight those</v>
<v Speaker 4>particular modules.</v>

395
00:17:57.481 --> 00:17:59.550
<v Speaker 4>I see.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I see flow like for me at the beginning</v>

396
00:17:59.551 --> 00:18:00.241
<v Speaker 4>of everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>

397
00:18:00.241 --> 00:18:03.710
<v Speaker 4>Because you go through the lab or joint</v>
<v Speaker 4>mobility and then you start to connect</v>

398
00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:07.710
<v Speaker 4>to exercise logically and connected to</v>
<v Speaker 4>what challenges your breathing so you're</v>

399
00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:11.070
<v Speaker 4>breathing will tell you exactly when</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're forcing your brain to some of the</v>

400
00:18:11.071 --> 00:18:13.560
<v Speaker 4>moment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You should start to understand the</v>

401
00:18:13.561 --> 00:18:15.810
<v Speaker 4>investigative.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why do I force through this range of</v>

402
00:18:15.811 --> 00:18:19.260
<v Speaker 4>motion?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Probably something is stiff for me.</v>

403
00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:22.200
<v Speaker 4>Maybe my giant might be my Fascia.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whatever it does allow me to flow</v>

404
00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:25.590
<v Speaker 4>through one one to the other moment</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I'm working six degree.</v>

405
00:18:25.591 --> 00:18:28.770
<v Speaker 4>I don't just work in their life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a yoga mat up and down,</v>

406
00:18:28.771 --> 00:18:33.320
<v Speaker 4>left and right and just to roll jumper</v>
<v Speaker 4>score to wherever is my body she</v>

407
00:18:33.390 --> 00:18:34.440
<v Speaker 4>supposed to be doing.</v>

408
00:18:35.450 --> 00:18:37.860
<v Speaker 4>I look like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like if you know the magic guys picture</v>

409
00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:38.903
<v Speaker 4>for me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the message guy,</v>

410
00:18:38.930 --> 00:18:40.380
<v Speaker 4>Peter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the one that you look and then you step</v>

411
00:18:40.381 --> 00:18:42.600
<v Speaker 4>back and the guy picture.</v>
<v Speaker 4>For me,</v>

412
00:18:42.601 --> 00:18:45.510
<v Speaker 4>it's the body.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know when I see you standing or do a</v>

413
00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:47.580
<v Speaker 4>couple of moment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can interpret that yourself a little</v>

414
00:18:47.581 --> 00:18:49.620
<v Speaker 4>bit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but when you move freestyle,</v>

415
00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:52.830
<v Speaker 4>now I can understand exactly what what's</v>
<v Speaker 4>going on with you.</v>

416
00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:55.090
<v Speaker 4>Do you drop your knee when you score 10</v>
<v Speaker 4>and do a.</v>

417
00:18:55.091 --> 00:18:57.000
<v Speaker 4>You know you don't do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your feet is not connected.</v>

418
00:18:57.001 --> 00:19:00.690
<v Speaker 4>You cannot talk your knee when you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can know even understanding loading</v>

419
00:19:00.691 --> 00:19:02.710
<v Speaker 4>one side,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you need lateral power in order to</v>

420
00:19:02.711 --> 00:19:03.510
<v Speaker 4>wildlife,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to the other.</v>

421
00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:06.330
<v Speaker 4>So for information,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's for me as a coach,</v>

422
00:19:06.331 --> 00:19:09.360
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I start to plan out what should be doing</v>

423
00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:12.210
<v Speaker 4>or kind of exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What kind of strength training maybe is</v>

424
00:19:12.211 --> 00:19:17.211
<v Speaker 4>neither for you more stability or more</v>
<v Speaker 4>more yoga because until you are already,</v>

425
00:19:17.370 --> 00:19:22.370
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't know like Chula lift to load</v>
<v Speaker 4>your body if your body's not able to in</v>

426
00:19:22.710 --> 00:19:23.420
<v Speaker 4>your own way.</v>

427
00:19:23.420 --> 00:19:25.670
<v Speaker 3>Well that's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most people don't know what their body's</v>

428
00:19:25.671 --> 00:19:29.090
<v Speaker 3>capable of doing like and there's a lot</v>
<v Speaker 3>of people that walk into any kind of a</v>

429
00:19:29.170 --> 00:19:32.630
<v Speaker 3>classmate start working out and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>might not even know what deficiencies</v>

430
00:19:32.631 --> 00:19:35.150
<v Speaker 3>they have because they've been</v>
<v Speaker 3>overcompensating for that.</v>

431
00:19:35.151 --> 00:19:36.240
<v Speaker 3>Or compensating,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

432
00:19:36.470 --> 00:19:38.990
<v Speaker 3>you might have something wrong with your</v>
<v Speaker 3>hip and because of that it's putting</v>

433
00:19:38.991 --> 00:19:41.180
<v Speaker 3>extra pressures on your knee or you</v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

434
00:19:41.181 --> 00:19:44.270
<v Speaker 3>one side might be over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's one thing that you see with a lot</v>

435
00:19:44.271 --> 00:19:46.190
<v Speaker 3>of people that have done very specific</v>
<v Speaker 3>sports,</v>

436
00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:49.330
<v Speaker 3>like they're very strong on one side and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then the other side of their body is</v>

437
00:19:49.331 --> 00:19:52.520
<v Speaker 3>weak and when you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you create these imbalances.</v>

438
00:19:52.700 --> 00:19:54.270
<v Speaker 3>You can get some serious injuries</v>
<v Speaker 3>because</v>

439
00:19:54.270 --> 00:19:56.360
<v Speaker 4>of that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we take it for granted.</v>

440
00:19:56.570 --> 00:19:57.520
<v Speaker 4>The time you say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

441
00:19:57.540 --> 00:19:59.050
<v Speaker 4>I wish my shoulder is in pain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but when I,</v>

442
00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:00.850
<v Speaker 4>when I trade,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no good,</v>

443
00:20:01.190 --> 00:20:02.090
<v Speaker 4>it's already the senior,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

444
00:20:02.091 --> 00:20:04.730
<v Speaker 4>you're training what you're going to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are you going to release the adrenaline</v>

445
00:20:04.790 --> 00:20:07.480
<v Speaker 4>and cortisol and that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those are painkiller that they are</v>

446
00:20:07.490 --> 00:20:09.260
<v Speaker 4>supposed to make you stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

447
00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:11.180
<v Speaker 4>fight in the freezer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fight situation.</v>

448
00:20:11.181 --> 00:20:13.760
<v Speaker 4>That's what is the endocrine system is</v>
<v Speaker 4>doing to you.</v>

449
00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:17.700
<v Speaker 4>But after your training,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you got even worse than you to</v>

450
00:20:17.780 --> 00:20:19.660
<v Speaker 4>understand that there's a coach.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You should be saying,</v>

451
00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:22.370
<v Speaker 4>now what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>We need to fix that because it's no good</v>

452
00:20:22.371 --> 00:20:24.560
<v Speaker 4>that you start training and working into</v>
<v Speaker 4>the pain because you were going to</v>

453
00:20:24.561 --> 00:20:28.700
<v Speaker 4>create more raw material.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There is no neither into your body and</v>

454
00:20:28.701 --> 00:20:32.000
<v Speaker 4>for me it's like holding this bottle</v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't wait nothing today,</v>

455
00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:34.310
<v Speaker 4>tomorrow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if I order for one hour,</v>

456
00:20:34.311 --> 00:20:38.780
<v Speaker 4>this becoming heavy so we adapt to this</v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of similar and they didn't change</v>

457
00:20:38.781 --> 00:20:43.310
<v Speaker 4>the level of the water in my butter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but day after day is going to kill me,</v>

458
00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:45.860
<v Speaker 4>but people don't understand because they</v>
<v Speaker 4>say,</v>

459
00:20:45.890 --> 00:20:46.580
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm used to.</v>

460
00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:47.730
<v Speaker 4>I used to do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't sleep.</v>

461
00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:49.990
<v Speaker 6>Used to do,</v>
<v Speaker 6>don't eat enough.</v>

462
00:20:49.991 --> 00:20:52.210
<v Speaker 6>I'm used to to,</v>
<v Speaker 6>to work in this pain.</v>

463
00:20:52.270 --> 00:20:55.780
<v Speaker 6>That's not going to happen now.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What do you think is the biggest injury</v>

464
00:20:55.781 --> 00:20:59.200
<v Speaker 6>that you deal with when you have clients</v>
<v Speaker 6>or people that you're working out with?</v>

465
00:20:59.230 --> 00:21:02.560
<v Speaker 6>What's the most common as it shoulder,</v>
<v Speaker 6>shoulder and the shoulder?</v>

466
00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:05.100
<v Speaker 6>More common those days,</v>
<v Speaker 6>especially because we,</v>

467
00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:09.170
<v Speaker 6>we become,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we all grew up in the era that we all</v>

468
00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:10.053
<v Speaker 6>want to,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

469
00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:13.780
<v Speaker 6>pack and a stroller.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Now press presses and I believe our</v>

470
00:21:13.781 --> 00:21:17.310
<v Speaker 6>shoulders are complex joint,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it's not strong at all because we</v>

471
00:21:17.410 --> 00:21:20.100
<v Speaker 6>were vertical animal,</v>
<v Speaker 6>not like chimpanzees.</v>

472
00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:24.610
<v Speaker 6>The destructor is holding back.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The horse can hold a lot of power in the</v>

473
00:21:24.611 --> 00:21:25.940
<v Speaker 6>shoulder,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the human,</v>

474
00:21:25.941 --> 00:21:28.180
<v Speaker 6>be sure that it's just dropping on the</v>
<v Speaker 6>ribcage,</v>

475
00:21:28.270 --> 00:21:32.920
<v Speaker 6>so awake and then simple question is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>are many of us can even stand,</v>

476
00:21:32.921 --> 00:21:35.740
<v Speaker 6>just stand standing on the wall with the</v>
<v Speaker 6>feet on the wall.</v>

477
00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:37.480
<v Speaker 6>Some people that can even hold their</v>
<v Speaker 6>weight,</v>

478
00:21:38.170 --> 00:21:39.790
<v Speaker 6>give me.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're saying to do handstands,</v>

479
00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:42.490
<v Speaker 6>just even simple like that and how many</v>
<v Speaker 6>people,</v>

480
00:21:42.491 --> 00:21:45.010
<v Speaker 6>even with the fit and the world can do</v>
<v Speaker 6>an instant press.</v>

481
00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:47.230
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Not that many.</v>

482
00:21:47.231 --> 00:21:52.231
<v Speaker 6>And if you ask how many of you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>10 or 10 out of 10 got shoulder injury</v>

483
00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:54.040
<v Speaker 6>probably denied.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They say,</v>

484
00:21:54.041 --> 00:21:55.450
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've got an issue since I've been in</v>

485
00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:58.660
<v Speaker 6>school.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So wic is very complex.</v>

486
00:21:58.661 --> 00:22:01.390
<v Speaker 6>A lot of tendons and ligaments,</v>
<v Speaker 6>multiple joints.</v>

487
00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:03.790
<v Speaker 6>Do you incorporate a lot of hanging?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

488
00:22:03.990 --> 00:22:06.970
<v Speaker 6>I think hanging is something that people</v>
<v Speaker 6>have been really concentrating on over</v>

489
00:22:06.971 --> 00:22:11.971
<v Speaker 6>the last few years for shoulder mobility</v>
<v Speaker 6>and alleviating impingements absolutely.</v>

490
00:22:12.011 --> 00:22:14.200
<v Speaker 6>And people listening to this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you have anything going on with your</v>

491
00:22:14.201 --> 00:22:15.110
<v Speaker 6>shoulder,</v>
<v Speaker 6>some talent,</v>

492
00:22:15.111 --> 00:22:19.900
<v Speaker 6>you grab a chin up bar and hanging from</v>
<v Speaker 6>that thing and just relaxes your</v>

493
00:22:19.901 --> 00:22:22.420
<v Speaker 6>shoulder.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It stretches out your joints and there's</v>

494
00:22:22.421 --> 00:22:27.280
<v Speaker 6>several doctors that stopped doing</v>
<v Speaker 6>shoulder surgeries and to alleviate pain</v>

495
00:22:27.281 --> 00:22:31.210
<v Speaker 6>they've started doing hanging exercises</v>
<v Speaker 6>and prescribing hanging exercises.</v>

496
00:22:31.540 --> 00:22:33.310
<v Speaker 6>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Just grab a chin up bar.</v>

497
00:22:33.430 --> 00:22:35.720
<v Speaker 6>Start hanging from that soccer history</v>
<v Speaker 6>though.</v>

498
00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:40.800
<v Speaker 6>He has the with the class structure 12,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I got 11.</v>

499
00:22:41.020 --> 00:22:44.680
<v Speaker 6>It's not like a formula.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The class I go back to the jump rope and</v>

500
00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:47.020
<v Speaker 6>just to get oxygen power so I don't pass</v>
<v Speaker 6>out.</v>

501
00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:49.380
<v Speaker 6>But Alberto come back,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're like 11,</v>

502
00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:52.810
<v Speaker 6>15 and give me homework assignments and</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're always different.</v>

503
00:22:52.811 --> 00:22:55.360
<v Speaker 6>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like some days it's a steel club.</v>

504
00:22:55.990 --> 00:23:00.060
<v Speaker 6>Sundays I'm just working on my hands and</v>
<v Speaker 6>knees and we incorporate our hips,</v>

505
00:23:00.070 --> 00:23:03.430
<v Speaker 6>but some days he puts me on rings.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He goes,</v>

506
00:23:03.610 --> 00:23:06.820
<v Speaker 6>you got rings at Your House,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Wrangler mastics rings.</v>

507
00:23:07.910 --> 00:23:09.640
<v Speaker 6>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what wall is going to hold me?</v>

508
00:23:09.641 --> 00:23:11.710
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he's got the whole thing and he just</v>

509
00:23:11.711 --> 00:23:14.530
<v Speaker 6>taught me one thing too,</v>
<v Speaker 6>because my biggest weakness is my</v>

510
00:23:14.531 --> 00:23:18.050
<v Speaker 6>breathing from the sleep apnea.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like I even got hypnotized.</v>

511
00:23:18.070 --> 00:23:19.030
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I got to go tomorrow,</v>

512
00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:21.790
<v Speaker 6>yet you got hypnotized,</v>
<v Speaker 6>been going to get hypnotized.</v>

513
00:23:22.060 --> 00:23:25.390
<v Speaker 6>What's going on with the sleep apnea?</v>
<v Speaker 6>You ever wake up with your pants down?</v>

514
00:23:25.510 --> 00:23:25.840
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

515
00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:26.530
<v Speaker 6>no.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I got it.</v>

516
00:23:26.530 --> 00:23:31.480
<v Speaker 6>Got So severe minds is such a bad case</v>
<v Speaker 6>from my machine broke a couple of weeks</v>

517
00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:33.400
<v Speaker 6>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 6>My wife had to go pick up the machine</v>

518
00:23:33.401 --> 00:23:35.890
<v Speaker 6>for me up in Logan.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The guy was saying,</v>

519
00:23:35.891 --> 00:23:37.180
<v Speaker 6>how's Joey doing?</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know?</v>

520
00:23:37.181 --> 00:23:38.014
<v Speaker 6>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

521
00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:39.940
<v Speaker 6>that til this day,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Joe,</v>

522
00:23:39.941 --> 00:23:44.390
<v Speaker 6>he came in here as one of the worst</v>
<v Speaker 6>cases like Joe,</v>

523
00:23:44.420 --> 00:23:45.980
<v Speaker 6>he was in bad shape.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You</v>

524
00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:49.970
<v Speaker 2>remember what I was going through the</v>
<v Speaker 2>sleep on your steering wheel and,</v>

525
00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:53.330
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that sleep apnea,</v>

526
00:23:53.331 --> 00:23:57.490
<v Speaker 2>like whenever my heart gets going and</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu like no other places,</v>

527
00:23:57.510 --> 00:23:59.000
<v Speaker 2>my heart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're gone like that when I'm on the</v>

528
00:23:59.001 --> 00:24:00.210
<v Speaker 2>bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's all.</v>

529
00:24:00.300 --> 00:24:03.230
<v Speaker 2>At first when I joined Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I overcame the panic attacks.</v>

530
00:24:03.770 --> 00:24:07.820
<v Speaker 2>So I had to just go stand on the bottom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I forced myself to get on the</v>

531
00:24:07.821 --> 00:24:08.940
<v Speaker 2>bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kept like a,</v>

532
00:24:08.950 --> 00:24:11.780
<v Speaker 2>whatever you call it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bridge or whatever they call it a</v>

533
00:24:11.781 --> 00:24:15.140
<v Speaker 2>frame and I breathe and I overcame my</v>
<v Speaker 2>fear.</v>

534
00:24:15.390 --> 00:24:18.320
<v Speaker 2>But the other fear I had was when I get</v>
<v Speaker 2>to round up,</v>

535
00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:22.010
<v Speaker 2>I can't control my breathing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's when I get up from their sleep</v>

536
00:24:22.011 --> 00:24:24.110
<v Speaker 2>apnea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I just,</v>

537
00:24:24.170 --> 00:24:28.130
<v Speaker 2>I kept thinking about something you said</v>
<v Speaker 2>about a couple of podcasts ago,</v>

538
00:24:28.131 --> 00:24:30.290
<v Speaker 2>but a sports,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

539
00:24:31.130 --> 00:24:32.330
<v Speaker 2>sports,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

540
00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:34.440
<v Speaker 2>psychiatry is something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sports psychologist,</v>

541
00:24:34.441 --> 00:24:37.490
<v Speaker 2>some people have it and I did some</v>
<v Speaker 2>reading and I said,</v>

542
00:24:37.491 --> 00:24:39.260
<v Speaker 2>let me just go alleviate this last fit.</v>

543
00:24:39.670 --> 00:24:40.503
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many feet you,</v>

544
00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:43.100
<v Speaker 2>I got the needle for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But last week I got,</v>

545
00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:44.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I still get that thing in my ear.</v>

546
00:24:45.170 --> 00:24:47.120
<v Speaker 2>She stuck a needle in my ear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Acupuncture,</v>

547
00:24:47.121 --> 00:24:50.150
<v Speaker 2>they take the fluid out because my ear</v>
<v Speaker 2>is not letting my right,</v>

548
00:24:50.210 --> 00:24:51.500
<v Speaker 2>my left ear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Florida.</v>

549
00:24:51.820 --> 00:24:55.880
<v Speaker 2>So either they've got to put fluids in</v>
<v Speaker 2>there just from we're taking showers,</v>

550
00:24:55.881 --> 00:24:58.090
<v Speaker 2>you know me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm obsessed with showers and I got</v>

551
00:24:58.100 --> 00:25:01.700
<v Speaker 2>plenty of plugs in my ears when I go in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the shower and I go in there for an hour</v>

552
00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:03.700
<v Speaker 2>when you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when California had the drought,</v>

553
00:25:03.950 --> 00:25:06.560
<v Speaker 2>I go to Vegas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got one of those king size pin shouts.</v>

554
00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:08.870
<v Speaker 2>I smoked a joint going there for an hour</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a half.</v>

555
00:25:08.871 --> 00:25:10.340
<v Speaker 2>I read jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

556
00:25:10.341 --> 00:25:13.710
<v Speaker 2>I love taking long showers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shower material.</v>

557
00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:18.410
<v Speaker 2>Really your best material level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can even practice it in that</v>

558
00:25:22.250 --> 00:25:23.510
<v Speaker 2>fluid stuck in my ear.</v>

559
00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:28.100
<v Speaker 2>And last week I went to acupuncture and</v>
<v Speaker 2>she stuck a needle in there and when she</v>

560
00:25:28.101 --> 00:25:30.020
<v Speaker 2>took it out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it relieved the pressure.</v>

561
00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:33.860
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could feel the blood dripping down my</v>

562
00:25:33.861 --> 00:25:37.580
<v Speaker 2>face and I could hear it hitting the</v>
<v Speaker 2>pillow and I didn't pass out.</v>

563
00:25:38.010 --> 00:25:42.530
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to get these fears a little way</v>

564
00:25:42.531 --> 00:25:45.500
<v Speaker 2>back to tactical fitness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The rings,</v>

565
00:25:45.501 --> 00:25:49.940
<v Speaker 2>he has rings and Alberto taught me</v>
<v Speaker 2>emotion that it's all about my</v>

566
00:25:49.941 --> 00:25:52.550
<v Speaker 2>breathing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't leave my ass on the floor.</v>

567
00:25:52.850 --> 00:25:56.900
<v Speaker 2>So I basically pick up my hips as a hip</v>
<v Speaker 2>escape and in the same.</v>

568
00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:59.240
<v Speaker 2>Then I hold that breath,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I pulled myself up.</v>

569
00:25:59.510 --> 00:26:04.510
<v Speaker 2>I stay there and then I as I leave my</v>
<v Speaker 2>hips back is when I exhale and then my</v>

570
00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:09.050
<v Speaker 2>arms go down on that one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's a two point breathing thing,</v>

571
00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:11.330
<v Speaker 2>dog.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do three sets of 10 of those.</v>

572
00:26:11.331 --> 00:26:12.980
<v Speaker 2>I'm on fire after that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

573
00:26:12.981 --> 00:26:14.570
<v Speaker 2>I'm a big believer in that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fire</v>

574
00:26:15.220 --> 00:26:18.080
<v Speaker 3>breathing is gigantic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's another thing that seems so simple,</v>

575
00:26:18.150 --> 00:26:19.490
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's another thing you tell people,</v>

576
00:26:19.491 --> 00:26:20.930
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got to do some breathing exercises.</v>

577
00:26:21.660 --> 00:26:24.840
<v Speaker 3>People that I'm not doing that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm doing bench and bro going to build</v>

578
00:26:24.850 --> 00:26:25.760
<v Speaker 3>up my pecs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bro.</v>

579
00:26:26.090 --> 00:26:27.050
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what people do.</v>

580
00:26:27.051 --> 00:26:28.520
<v Speaker 3>They don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't think that breathing is</v>

581
00:26:28.521 --> 00:26:30.640
<v Speaker 3>difficult,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but breathing exercises I.</v>

582
00:26:30.690 --> 00:26:33.260
<v Speaker 3>This is what I tell people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Breathe in for one minute and breathe</v>

583
00:26:33.261 --> 00:26:35.510
<v Speaker 3>out for one minute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tell me that's not hard.</v>

584
00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:40.490
<v Speaker 3>Just take a one minute breath in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at a clock and say ready,</v>

585
00:26:40.491 --> 00:26:44.160
<v Speaker 3>go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then breathe in for one solid</v>

586
00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:46.260
<v Speaker 5>minute,</v>
<v Speaker 5>nice and slow,</v>

587
00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:49.290
<v Speaker 5>and then breathe out for one minute.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nice and slow.</v>

588
00:26:49.300 --> 00:26:51.510
<v Speaker 5>You'll be fucking dead.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're not going to be able to do it.</v>

589
00:26:51.870 --> 00:26:53.290
<v Speaker 5>Most people can hold their breath for a</v>
<v Speaker 5>minute.</v>

590
00:26:53.550 --> 00:26:56.190
<v Speaker 5>If you tell them to breathe in for one</v>
<v Speaker 5>solid minute,</v>

591
00:26:57.030 --> 00:27:00.470
<v Speaker 5>it's really hard to do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but then you go to like a yoga class and</v>

592
00:27:00.471 --> 00:27:01.380
<v Speaker 5>you take,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

593
00:27:01.381 --> 00:27:02.400
<v Speaker 5>Yoga,</v>
<v Speaker 5>deep breathing,</v>

594
00:27:02.550 --> 00:27:05.970
<v Speaker 5>Pranayama exercises.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're very difficult and one of the</v>

595
00:27:05.971 --> 00:27:07.800
<v Speaker 5>things that I.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When I first started doing yoga,</v>

596
00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:10.440
<v Speaker 5>like about two years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I really started getting into it again.</v>

597
00:27:10.910 --> 00:27:11.743
<v Speaker 5>The,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

598
00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:14.310
<v Speaker 5>the breathing exercises after class when</v>
<v Speaker 5>you like,</v>

599
00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:17.100
<v Speaker 5>when you're doing those breathing</v>
<v Speaker 5>exercises.</v>

600
00:27:17.430 --> 00:27:21.350
<v Speaker 5>It was like my stomach felt soft.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It felt like it was kind of weak.</v>

601
00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:23.310
<v Speaker 5>Like you would get tired doing those.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

602
00:27:23.460 --> 00:27:24.360
<v Speaker 5>why is my.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I was like,</v>

603
00:27:24.361 --> 00:27:25.530
<v Speaker 5>I'm just tired from Yoga.</v>

604
00:27:25.650 --> 00:27:28.470
<v Speaker 5>Like why is my stomach getting tired</v>
<v Speaker 5>from breathing out?</v>

605
00:27:28.471 --> 00:27:30.450
<v Speaker 5>Like pushing air out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's so simple.</v>

606
00:27:30.451 --> 00:27:33.990
<v Speaker 5>Like I do sit ups and leg lifts and all</v>
<v Speaker 5>this different stuff.</v>

607
00:27:33.991 --> 00:27:36.900
<v Speaker 5>Like why is that difficult?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because it's a different kind of thing</v>

608
00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:39.330
<v Speaker 5>and you're breathing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're pushing air out with your</v>

609
00:27:39.331 --> 00:27:44.120
<v Speaker 5>diaphragm and your abdominal muscles.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But now I could do it pretty good and,</v>

610
00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:46.020
<v Speaker 5>but you get to like that Hicks and</v>
<v Speaker 5>Gracie Point,</v>

611
00:27:46.021 --> 00:27:50.430
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure you've seen that pull in the</v>
<v Speaker 5>muscles up in these weird ways and make</v>

612
00:27:50.431 --> 00:27:54.240
<v Speaker 5>them dance and it's so connected.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Brain brain is connected to your</v>

613
00:27:54.241 --> 00:27:56.570
<v Speaker 5>breeding,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the heart granted to your breathing and</v>

614
00:27:56.800 --> 00:28:00.780
<v Speaker 5>understanding what's important to regain</v>
<v Speaker 5>access to proper breathing.</v>

615
00:28:00.890 --> 00:28:03.000
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Even for people to think,</v>

616
00:28:03.001 --> 00:28:04.590
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>breeding for meditation.</v>

617
00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:09.160
<v Speaker 5>No into the olive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No pre written is good for everything.</v>

618
00:28:09.170 --> 00:28:11.280
<v Speaker 5>He's visualizing what she needed to do</v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

619
00:28:11.310 --> 00:28:12.660
<v Speaker 5>They know reset.</v>

620
00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:16.200
<v Speaker 5>You can switch from your pressing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But that the theory of the sympathetic</v>

621
00:28:16.201 --> 00:28:18.470
<v Speaker 5>and parasympathetic.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

622
00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:19.241
<v Speaker 5>never sees him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

623
00:28:19.241 --> 00:28:23.220
<v Speaker 5>it's like you breathe correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially on the stress and the you</v>

624
00:28:23.221 --> 00:28:25.350
<v Speaker 5>need to regain access to your community</v>
<v Speaker 5>president.</v>

625
00:28:25.351 --> 00:28:29.430
<v Speaker 5>Especially if you need to do something</v>
<v Speaker 5>that is more complex and you think about</v>

626
00:28:29.431 --> 00:28:31.350
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Some people that just thinking,</v>

627
00:28:31.351 --> 00:28:31.870
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>under,</v>

628
00:28:31.870 --> 00:28:35.130
<v Speaker 5>under the gas response,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know when my,</v>

629
00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:39.830
<v Speaker 5>my father Fraser fight or flight and the</v>
<v Speaker 5>tuition is on.</v>

630
00:28:39.870 --> 00:28:42.660
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I probably go to my gross motor skills.</v>

631
00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:45.600
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But some people like an advanced fight</v>

632
00:28:45.601 --> 00:28:50.070
<v Speaker 5>that on a an operator,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they need to go to access to gross motor</v>

633
00:28:50.071 --> 00:28:51.830
<v Speaker 5>skills and fine motor skills.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Think about,</v>

634
00:28:51.850 --> 00:28:54.780
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to run across this room.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I need to use my gross motor,</v>

635
00:28:54.781 --> 00:28:57.450
<v Speaker 5>skipped over on foster,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I need to understand what am I going</v>

636
00:28:57.451 --> 00:29:00.240
<v Speaker 5>to find covert and maybe shooting back</v>
<v Speaker 5>to a target.</v>

637
00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:04.210
<v Speaker 5>So now you have final the skates on and</v>
<v Speaker 5>gross motor skills.</v>

638
00:29:04.260 --> 00:29:08.550
<v Speaker 5>Any to be able to get my product</v>
<v Speaker 5>vertical view because I can't explain my</v>

639
00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:09.990
<v Speaker 5>tuna.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So hold on.</v>

640
00:29:09.991 --> 00:29:12.890
<v Speaker 5>Let's let your English was tripping.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's okay.</v>

641
00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:15.090
<v Speaker 5>I see.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What you're talking about is a big motor</v>

642
00:29:15.091 --> 00:29:20.000
<v Speaker 5>skills like running and sprinting and</v>
<v Speaker 5>then being able to shoot a gun up and be</v>

643
00:29:20.010 --> 00:29:24.300
<v Speaker 5>very precise and very accurate,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is an the outfit interpret that</v>

644
00:29:24.310 --> 00:29:28.380
<v Speaker 5>enables the people shooting at me from</v>
<v Speaker 5>so complex.</v>

645
00:29:29.250 --> 00:29:31.230
<v Speaker 5>Complex.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So do you have guys do that?</v>

646
00:29:31.231 --> 00:29:34.130
<v Speaker 5>Do you have guys like lift weights and</v>
<v Speaker 5>then go or do licks,</v>

647
00:29:34.260 --> 00:29:38.080
<v Speaker 5>strenuous physical exercises then go</v>
<v Speaker 5>immediately to a range or honoring?</v>

648
00:29:38.220 --> 00:29:39.480
<v Speaker 5>We do that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but also,</v>

649
00:29:39.481 --> 00:29:41.950
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when we will start with what is the</v>

650
00:29:41.951 --> 00:29:42.430
<v Speaker 5>importance</v>

651
00:29:42.430 --> 00:29:43.180
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

652
00:29:43.180 --> 00:29:47.860
<v Speaker 4>learning how to recover fast to using</v>
<v Speaker 4>the breathing recovery Britain,</v>

653
00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:51.400
<v Speaker 4>like the tactical breathing in some feel</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you were talking about some they</v>

654
00:29:51.410 --> 00:29:53.540
<v Speaker 4>never see,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they used to do a lot for me and it's a</v>

655
00:29:53.590 --> 00:29:56.230
<v Speaker 4>44 seconds in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>four seconds,</v>

656
00:29:56.770 --> 00:30:01.660
<v Speaker 4>four seconds on a very basic way to</v>
<v Speaker 4>learn how to get back from the</v>

657
00:30:01.870 --> 00:30:06.870
<v Speaker 4>intensities to above your Ra Max tool,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say 85 percent something that you</v>

658
00:30:07.301 --> 00:30:10.000
<v Speaker 4>can bring you back to a cognitive</v>
<v Speaker 4>presence so you can make the right</v>

659
00:30:10.001 --> 00:30:12.370
<v Speaker 4>decision.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's what you tell people to do.</v>

660
00:30:12.371 --> 00:30:14.200
<v Speaker 4>Take a four second end and for second</v>
<v Speaker 4>out.</v>

661
00:30:14.201 --> 00:30:16.540
<v Speaker 4>So you're like slow controlling of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>breathing.</v>

662
00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:19.230
<v Speaker 4>That's the beginning of understanding</v>
<v Speaker 4>because we're going to be,</v>

663
00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:24.400
<v Speaker 4>when it would be going to start going</v>
<v Speaker 4>into my nose and maybe taking a post,</v>

664
00:30:26.350 --> 00:30:28.060
<v Speaker 4>go out to my mind.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the,</v>

665
00:30:28.061 --> 00:30:30.820
<v Speaker 4>my iris would be in through the nose,</v>
<v Speaker 4>out through the mouth.</v>

666
00:30:30.820 --> 00:30:32.800
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That does seem to somehow or another</v>

667
00:30:32.801 --> 00:30:34.200
<v Speaker 4>slow down your heart rate for some</v>
<v Speaker 4>reason.</v>

668
00:30:34.220 --> 00:30:37.320
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's your slow down.</v>

669
00:30:37.330 --> 00:30:38.920
<v Speaker 4>He's going to give you a senior back to</v>
<v Speaker 4>your brain.</v>

670
00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:41.440
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now we switched our finances under</v>

671
00:30:41.441 --> 00:30:43.660
<v Speaker 4>control so you can make the right</v>
<v Speaker 4>decision.</v>

672
00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:47.690
<v Speaker 4>You can get back to the the final</v>
<v Speaker 4>discussion that if it's needed right</v>

673
00:30:47.830 --> 00:30:50.260
<v Speaker 4>then that obviously with when you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>training soldiers,</v>

674
00:30:50.261 --> 00:30:53.140
<v Speaker 4>it's got to be one of the most important</v>
<v Speaker 4>things to do to be able to operate under</v>

675
00:30:53.141 --> 00:30:55.990
<v Speaker 4>pressure and under physical pressure and</v>
<v Speaker 4>make the right choice.</v>

676
00:30:56.100 --> 00:30:57.670
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's different.</v>

677
00:30:57.671 --> 00:30:59.260
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're not panicking.</v>

678
00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:04.600
<v Speaker 4>The survival response would tell you do</v>
<v Speaker 4>the things that maybe it's more logical</v>

679
00:31:04.601 --> 00:31:07.180
<v Speaker 4>to save your life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but sometimes like I always use this</v>

680
00:31:07.181 --> 00:31:08.740
<v Speaker 4>example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're going to cross the street right</v>

681
00:31:08.741 --> 00:31:10.220
<v Speaker 4>now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're going to cross,</v>

682
00:31:10.221 --> 00:31:11.360
<v Speaker 4>you see the car,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to freeze,</v>

683
00:31:11.380 --> 00:31:13.810
<v Speaker 4>and then you're deciding,</v>
<v Speaker 4>jump back or jump forward,</v>

684
00:31:13.811 --> 00:31:15.550
<v Speaker 4>whatever is your response to see.</v>

685
00:31:16.290 --> 00:31:18.070
<v Speaker 4>Don't get hit by the car.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

686
00:31:18.550 --> 00:31:23.550
<v Speaker 4>But it may take like 12 milliseconds in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you've been training more to that</v>

687
00:31:24.740 --> 00:31:28.210
<v Speaker 4>kind of alarm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to see the car and you want</v>

688
00:31:28.211 --> 00:31:32.110
<v Speaker 4>to do before you jump in and out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're going to look and see on the</v>

689
00:31:32.111 --> 00:31:33.740
<v Speaker 4>other side because maybe you see the</v>
<v Speaker 4>car,</v>

690
00:31:33.741 --> 00:31:35.470
<v Speaker 4>you jump back,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you didn't see the car coming from</v>

691
00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:39.730
<v Speaker 4>another part and you get killed for the</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ellicott that take our response of 300</v>

692
00:31:39.731 --> 00:31:43.750
<v Speaker 4>millisecond,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it's the Amiga will tell you to do</v>

693
00:31:43.751 --> 00:31:48.160
<v Speaker 4>whatever is needed to get out from the</v>
<v Speaker 4>problem faster,</v>

694
00:31:48.670 --> 00:31:53.370
<v Speaker 4>but the long way of your brain response,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you've been training,</v>

695
00:31:53.380 --> 00:31:56.560
<v Speaker 4>you become resilient to the alarm and</v>
<v Speaker 4>shock situation.</v>

696
00:31:56.890 --> 00:32:00.130
<v Speaker 4>You're going to make the right choice</v>
<v Speaker 4>and for an operator,</v>

697
00:32:00.131 --> 00:32:02.860
<v Speaker 4>for a fight or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a logical thing about Jujitsu,</v>

698
00:32:02.861 --> 00:32:04.360
<v Speaker 4>a chess game,</v>
<v Speaker 4>chess game,</v>

699
00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:06.310
<v Speaker 4>even those guys to play chess.</v>

700
00:32:06.830 --> 00:32:10.840
<v Speaker 4>So under stress,</v>
<v Speaker 4>our brain is cooking and the guys make a</v>

701
00:32:10.841 --> 00:32:13.930
<v Speaker 4>move and maybe me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they're not playing and just,</v>

702
00:32:13.931 --> 00:32:14.830
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I see the move.</v>

703
00:32:14.831 --> 00:32:17.710
<v Speaker 4>I see I got moved this way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The other guy's planning with taking</v>

704
00:32:17.711 --> 00:32:21.340
<v Speaker 4>more time to plan whatever is going on</v>
<v Speaker 4>because you start to understand why you</v>

705
00:32:21.341 --> 00:32:23.410
<v Speaker 4>did that move.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's not a logical for me,</v>

706
00:32:23.411 --> 00:32:27.220
<v Speaker 4>I shouldn't be going that way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And in training regarding access to your</v>

707
00:32:27.221 --> 00:32:28.270
<v Speaker 4>breath,</v>
<v Speaker 4>into your right,</v>

708
00:32:28.330 --> 00:32:30.790
<v Speaker 4>to your brain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>control is fundamental.</v>

709
00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:35.800
<v Speaker 4>That's why I believe we need to be</v>
<v Speaker 4>careful and understand fitness is so</v>

710
00:32:35.801 --> 00:32:37.270
<v Speaker 4>important.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We can do a lot of things.</v>

711
00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:39.620
<v Speaker 4>It's not just changing our other way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They look.</v>

712
00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:42.080
<v Speaker 3>We can add different people in different</v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

713
00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:46.460
<v Speaker 3>For some people it's life changing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You had the ability to be calm under</v>

714
00:32:46.550 --> 00:32:50.090
<v Speaker 3>pressure is something that very few</v>
<v Speaker 3>people have and they just don't.</v>

715
00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:52.430
<v Speaker 3>They don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not something that they exercise.</v>

716
00:32:52.460 --> 00:32:54.290
<v Speaker 3>They don't get to do it on a regular</v>
<v Speaker 3>basis.</v>

717
00:32:54.291 --> 00:32:58.040
<v Speaker 3>They don't get severely stressed so that</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they are in a severe stress</v>

718
00:32:58.041 --> 00:33:01.280
<v Speaker 3>situation and they have to make a</v>
<v Speaker 3>critical decision or they have to use</v>

719
00:33:01.281 --> 00:33:03.500
<v Speaker 3>fine motor skills in a critical</v>
<v Speaker 3>situation,</v>

720
00:33:03.501 --> 00:33:06.440
<v Speaker 3>most people are just completely</v>
<v Speaker 3>incapable of handling that.</v>

721
00:33:06.630 --> 00:33:10.580
<v Speaker 3>That'll emotional and physiological load</v>
<v Speaker 3>or what is it about.</v>

722
00:33:10.610 --> 00:33:13.460
<v Speaker 3>There's something interesting about</v>
<v Speaker 3>breathing in through your mouth that</v>

723
00:33:13.461 --> 00:33:16.730
<v Speaker 3>creates like a panic feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like when guys are tired.</v>

724
00:33:16.890 --> 00:33:17.723
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what is.</v>

725
00:33:17.830 --> 00:33:20.390
<v Speaker 3>I don't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it's a shallow breathing thing that</v>

726
00:33:20.391 --> 00:33:21.170
<v Speaker 3>happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

727
00:33:21.170 --> 00:33:25.040
<v Speaker 3>They took too much air in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe that's what it is in the</v>

728
00:33:25.041 --> 00:33:26.090
<v Speaker 3>brace,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the province,</v>

729
00:33:26.340 --> 00:33:30.430
<v Speaker 3>they bring clamp up called the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we call it like a,</v>

730
00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:35.060
<v Speaker 3>like a fourth leg to into the fear</v>
<v Speaker 3>reaction and so for your brain,</v>

731
00:33:35.780 --> 00:33:37.590
<v Speaker 3>while you bracing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bracing where you don't know,</v>

732
00:33:37.690 --> 00:33:40.190
<v Speaker 3>something you never expecting.</v>

733
00:33:40.580 --> 00:33:44.090
<v Speaker 3>So for my brain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my data bases say he's been there before</v>

734
00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:46.700
<v Speaker 3>in your life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd be freezing for something and they</v>

735
00:33:46.701 --> 00:33:47.630
<v Speaker 3>will bring you back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

736
00:33:47.690 --> 00:33:52.160
<v Speaker 3>this is a fierce situation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so your sympathetic system is on and you</v>

737
00:33:52.161 --> 00:33:54.830
<v Speaker 3>start to lose control.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hit that panic mode.</v>

738
00:33:54.831 --> 00:33:58.140
<v Speaker 3>I think it's so simple.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know how many time you let you touch</v>

739
00:33:58.300 --> 00:34:02.930
<v Speaker 3>your when when you're under stress or</v>
<v Speaker 3>under the assumption you know you'll be</v>

740
00:34:03.110 --> 00:34:05.180
<v Speaker 3>losing control of your.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you.</v>

741
00:34:05.240 --> 00:34:06.920
<v Speaker 3>We fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have a discussion,</v>

742
00:34:06.921 --> 00:34:09.560
<v Speaker 3>very intensive discussion and you can</v>
<v Speaker 3>touch your lace.</v>

743
00:34:09.680 --> 00:34:14.680
<v Speaker 3>So</v>
<v Speaker 3>breathing in.</v>

744
00:34:15.230 --> 00:34:18.560
<v Speaker 3>One of the things that you really</v>
<v Speaker 3>learned that during yoga class in</v>

745
00:34:18.680 --> 00:34:21.200
<v Speaker 3>various particularly stressful</v>
<v Speaker 3>situations,</v>

746
00:34:21.380 --> 00:34:23.960
<v Speaker 3>it's so hard to breathe smooth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the.</v>

747
00:34:23.990 --> 00:34:27.200
<v Speaker 3>One of the things that I've learned how</v>
<v Speaker 3>to do is to try to concentrate only on</v>

748
00:34:27.201 --> 00:34:30.080
<v Speaker 3>my breath and it actually makes the</v>
<v Speaker 3>exercise easier,</v>

749
00:34:30.350 --> 00:34:33.110
<v Speaker 3>which doesn't seem to make any sense</v>
<v Speaker 3>because before I would just be</v>

750
00:34:33.111 --> 00:34:36.650
<v Speaker 3>concentrating on the exercise and what I</v>
<v Speaker 3>realized somewhere along the line is my</v>

751
00:34:36.710 --> 00:34:41.710
<v Speaker 3>breath is not very smooth and I'm not</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing a good job of controlling myself.</v>

752
00:34:42.230 --> 00:34:46.280
<v Speaker 3>So now when I'm in a situation like a</v>
<v Speaker 3>really difficult like standing bow pose</v>

753
00:34:46.281 --> 00:34:48.650
<v Speaker 3>or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I concentrated on more than</v>

754
00:34:48.651 --> 00:34:53.000
<v Speaker 3>anything more even than the posture is</v>
<v Speaker 3>just my breathing concentrate on big,</v>

755
00:34:53.001 --> 00:34:55.220
<v Speaker 3>slow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>deep breaths and I swear it makes it</v>

756
00:34:55.221 --> 00:34:58.550
<v Speaker 3>like 10 percent easier.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just concentrating on the breathing</v>

757
00:34:58.750 --> 00:35:01.550
<v Speaker 3>makes everything easier.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Chrome Gracie said that too.</v>

758
00:35:01.551 --> 00:35:04.370
<v Speaker 3>When he was in here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We were talking about Jujitsu and he's</v>

759
00:35:04.371 --> 00:35:05.300
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's breath.</v>

760
00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:08.510
<v Speaker 3>Breath is everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And once you can control your breath,</v>

761
00:35:08.511 --> 00:35:10.400
<v Speaker 3>when you understand how to control your</v>
<v Speaker 3>breath,</v>

762
00:35:10.820 --> 00:35:14.100
<v Speaker 3>it makes those positions better,</v>
<v Speaker 3>makes Jujitsu easier.</v>

763
00:35:14.101 --> 00:35:18.710
<v Speaker 3>It makes everything better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So your breath control your breath,</v>

764
00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:20.010
<v Speaker 3>Jolie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you say that,</v>

765
00:35:20.020 --> 00:35:22.220
<v Speaker 3>I think you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I allowed all of us.</v>

766
00:35:22.221 --> 00:35:27.200
<v Speaker 3>We know how to brace.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are we talking for half an hour?</v>

767
00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:29.810
<v Speaker 3>We never stop it and do it while we're</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking,</v>

768
00:35:29.811 --> 00:35:34.220
<v Speaker 3>but we're not under stress to do the</v>
<v Speaker 3>problem is what people.</v>

769
00:35:34.490 --> 00:35:38.010
<v Speaker 3>They don't know how to excel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you take amend and put it under the</v>

770
00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:39.520
<v Speaker 2>water with the head,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

771
00:35:39.810 --> 00:35:41.610
<v Speaker 2>what is the last things is going to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>before you die?</v>

772
00:35:42.250 --> 00:35:44.190
<v Speaker 2>When it gets to breathing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the body.</v>

773
00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:48.000
<v Speaker 2>Exactly know when it's time to inhale.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't know how to.</v>

774
00:35:48.001 --> 00:35:50.360
<v Speaker 2>When it's time to exhale.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's fear.</v>

775
00:35:50.370 --> 00:35:53.460
<v Speaker 2>That's where we didn't have to force</v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

776
00:35:53.461 --> 00:35:55.590
<v Speaker 2>Hyperventilate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like my six year old gets upset about</v>

777
00:35:55.591 --> 00:35:57.900
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes she hyperventilates like she</v>

778
00:35:57.901 --> 00:35:59.790
<v Speaker 2>just can't get it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like she's upset.</v>

779
00:35:59.791 --> 00:36:03.270
<v Speaker 2>Like someone did this to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

780
00:36:03.271 --> 00:36:04.081
<v Speaker 2>and you've got to go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

781
00:36:04.081 --> 00:36:06.480
<v Speaker 2>you got to calm down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want you to take some big deep</v>

782
00:36:06.481 --> 00:36:08.670
<v Speaker 2>breaths,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's hard to teach a six year old</v>

783
00:36:08.710 --> 00:36:12.240
<v Speaker 2>doesn't know what the fuck do we do on</v>
<v Speaker 2>stage for breathing?</v>

784
00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:17.900
<v Speaker 2>Just talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never thought about it like I started</v>

785
00:36:18.601 --> 00:36:21.840
<v Speaker 2>getting anxiety at the store.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now when I walk up to the original</v>

786
00:36:21.841 --> 00:36:24.300
<v Speaker 2>room,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like on Tuesdays or when I did the</v>

787
00:36:24.301 --> 00:36:27.420
<v Speaker 2>wheelchair and I forced myself to</v>
<v Speaker 2>breathe in and out of my nose,</v>

788
00:36:28.020 --> 00:36:30.060
<v Speaker 2>but for years we're excited at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>store.</v>

789
00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:32.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the original launch I've been back.</v>

790
00:36:32.670 --> 00:36:34.710
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It all started.</v>

791
00:36:34.900 --> 00:36:38.580
<v Speaker 2>I had a follow Morgan Murphy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

792
00:36:38.581 --> 00:36:41.550
<v Speaker 2>I went up there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was on stage and I don't know what</v>

793
00:36:41.551 --> 00:36:43.800
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just get anxiety and the original room</v>

794
00:36:43.830 --> 00:36:46.150
<v Speaker 2>just a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just a little bit.</v>

795
00:36:46.770 --> 00:36:51.270
<v Speaker 2>And at the wiltern theater I walked out</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I looked that way and then I looked</v>

796
00:36:51.271 --> 00:36:55.080
<v Speaker 2>at the audience and it was like woo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I had to breathe through my nose,</v>

797
00:36:55.081 --> 00:36:59.260
<v Speaker 2>but what did we do on stage?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are we breathing through our nose or are</v>

798
00:36:59.261 --> 00:37:04.261
<v Speaker 2>we breathing through our mouth?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We fucking talk shit for 45,</v>

799
00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:08.080
<v Speaker 2>one hour.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I looked at the special shot.</v>

800
00:37:08.110 --> 00:37:09.510
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where am I breathing?</v>

801
00:37:11.630 --> 00:37:13.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How interesting that we got to watch</v>

802
00:37:13.891 --> 00:37:16.360
<v Speaker 2>that next time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck are we doing up there?</v>

803
00:37:17.190 --> 00:37:18.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not thinking.</v>

804
00:37:18.540 --> 00:37:20.430
<v Speaker 2>You're just breathing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

805
00:37:20.431 --> 00:37:23.340
<v Speaker 2>Will you just concentrated so much on</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you're trying to say that it all</v>

806
00:37:23.341 --> 00:37:25.650
<v Speaker 2>just comes natural.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just like right now while I'm talking to</v>

807
00:37:25.651 --> 00:37:27.020
<v Speaker 2>you right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like.</v>

808
00:37:27.021 --> 00:37:29.040
<v Speaker 2>I took a little breath right there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I wasn't thinking about it.</v>

809
00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:31.170
<v Speaker 2>I just don't want any.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to get a little bit of air.</v>

810
00:37:31.270 --> 00:37:31.690
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

811
00:37:31.690 --> 00:37:33.890
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because it's so natural for you.</v>

812
00:37:34.490 --> 00:37:38.250
<v Speaker 2>Maybe take me on a conference the first</v>
<v Speaker 2>time and wasn't going to be shaking and</v>

813
00:37:38.251 --> 00:37:43.251
<v Speaker 2>go around into my ward and then you see</v>
<v Speaker 2>that from people that are given speeches</v>

814
00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:48.870
<v Speaker 2>and you do see that when they've not</v>
<v Speaker 2>become comfortable with public speaking.</v>

815
00:37:49.110 --> 00:37:51.420
<v Speaker 2>Public speaking is one of the most</v>
<v Speaker 2>stressful things for people.</v>

816
00:37:51.510 --> 00:37:55.650
<v Speaker 2>For some people like number two or</v>
<v Speaker 2>number one in some people's world,</v>

817
00:37:55.651 --> 00:37:57.390
<v Speaker 2>like it's really bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had one.</v>

818
00:37:57.420 --> 00:38:01.410
<v Speaker 2>One time a judge asked me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was about to sentence me and he goes,</v>

819
00:38:01.411 --> 00:38:05.250
<v Speaker 2>do you ever say these for yourself?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I had it written down.</v>

820
00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:06.600
<v Speaker 2>I had everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe Rogan.</v>

821
00:38:07.890 --> 00:38:11.250
<v Speaker 2>I started tweaking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>

822
00:38:11.340 --> 00:38:12.173
<v Speaker 2>don't worry about it.</v>

823
00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:18.080
<v Speaker 2>Pan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't talk.</v>

824
00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:20.400
<v Speaker 2>I went right into a panic when this</v>
<v Speaker 2>little man looked at me,</v>

825
00:38:20.610 --> 00:38:22.370
<v Speaker 2>but people get nervous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

826
00:38:22.380 --> 00:38:25.320
<v Speaker 2>and when you get nervous your adrenaline</v>
<v Speaker 2>kicks in and when your adrenaline kicks</v>

827
00:38:25.321 --> 00:38:26.630
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything tightens it,</v>

828
00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:29.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just you know,</v>

829
00:38:29.011 --> 00:38:33.090
<v Speaker 2>and physiological stress like yoga</v>
<v Speaker 2>positions can kind of mimic that.</v>

830
00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:35.980
<v Speaker 2>Like when you were in a position like</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you got your hands over</v>

831
00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:38.170
<v Speaker 3>your head and you're leaning your whole</v>
<v Speaker 3>body to the side,</v>

832
00:38:38.470 --> 00:38:42.220
<v Speaker 3>it's very hard to stay smooth with your</v>
<v Speaker 3>breathing when you're in those spots.</v>

833
00:38:42.221 --> 00:38:45.340
<v Speaker 3>Like that's the number one thing that I</v>
<v Speaker 3>concentrate on holding my body in that</v>

834
00:38:45.341 --> 00:38:49.510
<v Speaker 3>position is not nearly as hard as</v>
<v Speaker 3>holding my body and breathing smoothly.</v>

835
00:38:49.750 --> 00:38:52.930
<v Speaker 3>Breathing smoothly is the most difficult</v>
<v Speaker 3>part of that posture,</v>

836
00:38:53.110 --> 00:38:53.943
<v Speaker 3>like a lot of pasta,</v>

837
00:38:55.330 --> 00:38:56.760
<v Speaker 4>and as soon as it's changed your</v>
<v Speaker 4>breathing,</v>

838
00:38:57.120 --> 00:38:59.630
<v Speaker 4>you started to changing inside and then</v>
<v Speaker 4>you change it outside.</v>

839
00:39:00.440 --> 00:39:01.840
<v Speaker 4>I see.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I see that happening.</v>

840
00:39:01.870 --> 00:39:05.190
<v Speaker 4>A lot of you know I love was the first</v>
<v Speaker 4>reaction when you're under stress,</v>

841
00:39:06.660 --> 00:39:07.710
<v Speaker 4>tension,</v>
<v Speaker 4>tension,</v>

842
00:39:07.711 --> 00:39:10.470
<v Speaker 4>but for four,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you look back there or what happened</v>

843
00:39:10.471 --> 00:39:14.580
<v Speaker 4>when you were in the pre storia phrase,</v>
<v Speaker 4>three prehistory,</v>

844
00:39:14.630 --> 00:39:17.880
<v Speaker 4>greatest thing about it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that you are a prey.</v>

845
00:39:17.940 --> 00:39:18.720
<v Speaker 4>What you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

846
00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:21.070
<v Speaker 4>like any animal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a cat in the road and the road they</v>

847
00:39:21.071 --> 00:39:23.750
<v Speaker 4>start to pump.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is hair hot,</v>

848
00:39:24.080 --> 00:39:24.930
<v Speaker 4>become bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

849
00:39:25.140 --> 00:39:28.920
<v Speaker 4>So that's what we doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We growing our shapes so the product</v>

850
00:39:28.921 --> 00:39:30.330
<v Speaker 4>might look at as like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

851
00:39:30.331 --> 00:39:33.060
<v Speaker 4>we're too big.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to attack a simple,</v>

852
00:39:33.190 --> 00:39:35.130
<v Speaker 4>simple prayer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We try to,</v>

853
00:39:35.131 --> 00:39:36.370
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>our,</v>

854
00:39:36.450 --> 00:39:40.370
<v Speaker 4>our skin start to trickle in Sanford,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like nice pumps.</v>

855
00:39:40.510 --> 00:39:40.891
<v Speaker 4>We,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

856
00:39:40.891 --> 00:39:42.930
<v Speaker 4>we don't have hair,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we start to do the same.</v>

857
00:39:42.931 --> 00:39:44.760
<v Speaker 4>Maybe the same example.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Goosebumps are.</v>

858
00:39:44.820 --> 00:39:47.110
<v Speaker 4>It's like your hair's figure.</v>

859
00:39:49.290 --> 00:39:53.160
<v Speaker 4>That's interesting and if I look in how</v>
<v Speaker 4>come it's like that when you hear a good</v>

860
00:39:53.161 --> 00:39:58.161
<v Speaker 4>song that's a different feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like a lot of people,</v>

861
00:39:58.891 --> 00:40:00.960
<v Speaker 4>they misinterpret it or the old thinking</v>
<v Speaker 4>that we thought,</v>

862
00:40:00.961 --> 00:40:02.570
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we go tactical training,</v>

863
00:40:02.580 --> 00:40:07.290
<v Speaker 4>we do this and we can control a fear</v>
<v Speaker 4>reaction to different things.</v>

864
00:40:07.291 --> 00:40:12.291
<v Speaker 4>You can control when you are really</v>
<v Speaker 4>under stress for the kind of situation,</v>

865
00:40:12.541 --> 00:40:15.690
<v Speaker 4>so our rate for years and other things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>matter of fact,</v>

866
00:40:16.050 --> 00:40:19.740
<v Speaker 4>I I intensity workout.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You become erad under fear.</v>

867
00:40:19.741 --> 00:40:21.390
<v Speaker 4>You become important,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it's different.</v>

868
00:40:21.391 --> 00:40:24.450
<v Speaker 4>Different physiological things going</v>
<v Speaker 4>into your into your body,</v>

869
00:40:24.451 --> 00:40:26.160
<v Speaker 4>so they all things that people didn't</v>
<v Speaker 4>want.</v>

870
00:40:26.310 --> 00:40:31.310
<v Speaker 4>Any misunderstanding that doing some</v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of a high intensity workout we can</v>

871
00:40:31.711 --> 00:40:35.130
<v Speaker 4>control also the fear,</v>
<v Speaker 4>real fear because real fears and other</v>

872
00:40:35.131 --> 00:40:35.964
<v Speaker 4>things.</v>

873
00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:37.660
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the things you see with fighters</v>

874
00:40:37.661 --> 00:40:39.940
<v Speaker 3>is they perform better when they're more</v>
<v Speaker 3>active,</v>

875
00:40:39.970 --> 00:40:42.670
<v Speaker 3>when they fight more often.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if the fighter fights like three</v>

876
00:40:42.671 --> 00:40:45.130
<v Speaker 3>times a year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're used to fighting every few</v>

877
00:40:45.130 --> 00:40:48.790
<v Speaker 3>months and they get that feeling of</v>
<v Speaker 3>competition becomes a normal natural</v>

878
00:40:48.791 --> 00:40:51.430
<v Speaker 3>thing for them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's also something that happens</v>

879
00:40:51.431 --> 00:40:54.310
<v Speaker 3>when you see a fight or lose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you see a fighter losing and they</v>

880
00:40:54.311 --> 00:40:56.560
<v Speaker 3>come back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were very tense and they fight.</v>

881
00:40:56.590 --> 00:40:59.560
<v Speaker 3>A lot of times they fight different</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they're.</v>

882
00:40:59.561 --> 00:41:04.540
<v Speaker 3>They're now worried and concerned about</v>
<v Speaker 3>the consequences of failure and you see</v>

883
00:41:04.541 --> 00:41:06.400
<v Speaker 3>that that fear,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that tension,</v>

884
00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:09.550
<v Speaker 3>it's in their system and then they their</v>
<v Speaker 3>whole,</v>

885
00:41:09.610 --> 00:41:12.940
<v Speaker 3>their whole mode of operating as a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As a,</v>

886
00:41:12.941 --> 00:41:15.640
<v Speaker 3>as an athlete changes because of that</v>
<v Speaker 3>tension.</v>

887
00:41:15.670 --> 00:41:17.130
<v Speaker 3>There's the dinner to Cobra for the</v>
<v Speaker 3>shot,</v>

888
00:41:17.230 --> 00:41:18.970
<v Speaker 3>for this situation they'd been through.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure,</v>

889
00:41:18.971 --> 00:41:19.840
<v Speaker 3>and that's all.</v>

890
00:41:19.940 --> 00:41:23.530
<v Speaker 3>Also one of the biggest factors when you</v>
<v Speaker 3>talk about the difference between the</v>

891
00:41:23.531 --> 00:41:27.880
<v Speaker 3>way someone performs in the gym versus</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way someone performs in competition.</v>

892
00:41:28.090 --> 00:41:31.930
<v Speaker 3>We've all known these guys that were</v>
<v Speaker 3>phenomenal in the gym,</v>

893
00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:35.630
<v Speaker 3>but for whatever reason they weren't</v>
<v Speaker 3>able to win in competition.</v>

894
00:41:35.810 --> 00:41:37.550
<v Speaker 3>It's so common.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's with some guys.</v>

895
00:41:37.551 --> 00:41:41.360
<v Speaker 3>It's almost like like it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's almost like there's a spell on them</v>

896
00:41:41.361 --> 00:41:43.330
<v Speaker 3>or something like you'll see them in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jimmy,</v>

897
00:41:43.340 --> 00:41:47.570
<v Speaker 3>like this guy is a world beater,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they can't beat anybody in a.</v>

898
00:41:47.570 --> 00:41:49.370
<v Speaker 3>In a competition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is psychological.</v>

899
00:41:49.371 --> 00:41:53.060
<v Speaker 3>It's all psychological.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There they are imprisoned by their own</v>

900
00:41:53.061 --> 00:41:56.780
<v Speaker 3>fears and doubts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't have the confidence to rise</v>

901
00:41:56.781 --> 00:41:58.370
<v Speaker 3>to the occasion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't have the confidence to</v>

902
00:41:58.371 --> 00:42:00.800
<v Speaker 3>perform under pressure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't have the.</v>

903
00:42:00.820 --> 00:42:04.340
<v Speaker 3>They can't just accept the potential</v>
<v Speaker 3>failure.</v>

904
00:42:04.430 --> 00:42:08.600
<v Speaker 3>They can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're so overwhelmed and imprisoned by</v>

905
00:42:08.601 --> 00:42:10.910
<v Speaker 3>their fear of failure that when they get</v>
<v Speaker 3>out there,</v>

906
00:42:10.911 --> 00:42:12.530
<v Speaker 3>they can't perform at their best.</v>

907
00:42:12.920 --> 00:42:16.310
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy because it forces failure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like a self fulfilling prophecy</v>

908
00:42:16.610 --> 00:42:18.920
<v Speaker 3>because they can't perform like they do</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the gym.</v>

909
00:42:19.130 --> 00:42:20.870
<v Speaker 3>They can't just react.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can't flow.</v>

910
00:42:21.220 --> 00:42:24.470
<v Speaker 3>Like when you were fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're at your best,</v>

911
00:42:24.740 --> 00:42:28.100
<v Speaker 3>you're sort of just in this empty space</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you're not.</v>

912
00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:31.670
<v Speaker 3>You're not thinking about the moves as</v>
<v Speaker 3>much as they're just happening and</v>

913
00:42:31.671 --> 00:42:35.680
<v Speaker 3>you're just relying on your training and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're almost the best thing you do is</v>

914
00:42:35.681 --> 00:42:37.970
<v Speaker 3>stay calm because as soon as you get</v>
<v Speaker 3>emotional,</v>

915
00:42:38.090 --> 00:42:40.670
<v Speaker 3>as soon as you get aggressive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you might win being emotional</v>

916
00:42:40.671 --> 00:42:42.170
<v Speaker 3>aggressive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could catch someone and knock them</v>

917
00:42:42.171 --> 00:42:43.850
<v Speaker 3>out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you also might get knocked out</v>

918
00:42:43.851 --> 00:42:46.640
<v Speaker 3>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You might do something that's not smart</v>

919
00:42:46.760 --> 00:42:48.910
<v Speaker 3>like when you're talking earlier about</v>
<v Speaker 3>playing chess.</v>

920
00:42:49.640 --> 00:42:52.640
<v Speaker 3>Martial arts is a lot of ways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like very much like chess,</v>

921
00:42:52.790 --> 00:42:57.110
<v Speaker 3>but way more complicated because your</v>
<v Speaker 3>physical consequences are so severe,</v>

922
00:42:57.320 --> 00:42:59.840
<v Speaker 3>so there's all this fear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not just about losing.</v>

923
00:43:00.080 --> 00:43:03.750
<v Speaker 3>It's about getting hit and that</v>
<v Speaker 3>punishment of physical consequences is</v>

924
00:43:03.810 --> 00:43:07.040
<v Speaker 3>so significant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so much different even than in</v>

925
00:43:07.041 --> 00:43:08.330
<v Speaker 3>Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jujitsu,</v>

926
00:43:08.540 --> 00:43:11.480
<v Speaker 3>the physical consequences are tapping</v>
<v Speaker 3>and losing and those are terrible,</v>

927
00:43:11.570 --> 00:43:15.050
<v Speaker 3>but it's nothing like getting kicked in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the face or getting one of those Yoel</v>

928
00:43:15.050 --> 00:43:17.150
<v Speaker 3>Romero flying knees to your head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

929
00:43:17.151 --> 00:43:21.980
<v Speaker 3>that kind of fear is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's an overwhelming fear and for some</v>

930
00:43:21.981 --> 00:43:26.150
<v Speaker 3>people they get a throw up when they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the locker room and they did panic</v>

931
00:43:26.180 --> 00:43:28.580
<v Speaker 3>me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they get so scared they just can't</v>

932
00:43:28.581 --> 00:43:29.660
<v Speaker 3>perform under pressure.</v>

933
00:43:30.340 --> 00:43:31.040
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

934
00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:34.770
<v Speaker 5>if you could trust for this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Also through some of the operator,</v>

935
00:43:34.771 --> 00:43:35.420
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

936
00:43:35.420 --> 00:43:40.420
<v Speaker 5>some of the operator that literally</v>
<v Speaker 5>dump and when you say an operator,</v>

937
00:43:41.071 --> 00:43:46.071
<v Speaker 5>you're talking about special ops guys</v>
<v Speaker 5>that the tough and didn't a super guys</v>

938
00:43:47.030 --> 00:43:49.530
<v Speaker 5>know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm amazed by those guys.</v>

939
00:43:50.020 --> 00:43:52.530
<v Speaker 5>They just chapeau but there's naturally,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

940
00:43:52.610 --> 00:43:55.230
<v Speaker 5>they don't do it in the task.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It might.</v>

941
00:43:55.320 --> 00:43:57.020
<v Speaker 5>I might be shitting in my pants,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

942
00:43:57.270 --> 00:44:00.860
<v Speaker 5>it's not physiological,</v>
<v Speaker 5>physiological and then you keep going,</v>

943
00:44:01.510 --> 00:44:04.410
<v Speaker 5>just keep going with shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's the physiological reaction to</v>

944
00:44:04.411 --> 00:44:07.290
<v Speaker 5>the stress factor.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Your body wants to get lighter,</v>

945
00:44:07.291 --> 00:44:09.510
<v Speaker 5>to fight back faster or run away or</v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever.</v>

946
00:44:09.511 --> 00:44:10.670
<v Speaker 5>You can control,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

947
00:44:10.680 --> 00:44:13.290
<v Speaker 5>there's nothing to be ashamed about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You see it with animals as well.</v>

948
00:44:13.291 --> 00:44:15.120
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a famous video these two bears</v>

949
00:44:15.121 --> 00:44:17.060
<v Speaker 5>fighting and as the bears are fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're,</v>

950
00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:19.920
<v Speaker 5>they're shitting all over the place as</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're fighting,</v>

951
00:44:19.980 --> 00:44:21.660
<v Speaker 5>they're shitting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

952
00:44:21.661 --> 00:44:22.300
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

953
00:44:22.300 --> 00:44:26.040
<v Speaker 5>I love watching movies like collateral</v>
<v Speaker 5>or something.</v>

954
00:44:26.041 --> 00:44:30.780
<v Speaker 5>When people go into some place and they</v>
<v Speaker 5>shoot the place up and people's reaction</v>

955
00:44:31.100 --> 00:44:31.933
<v Speaker 5>are they run.</v>

956
00:44:32.250 --> 00:44:33.600
<v Speaker 2>That's not usually the case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bro.</v>

957
00:44:33.690 --> 00:44:36.630
<v Speaker 2>I've seen it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People dropped on the fucking floor.</v>

958
00:44:37.260 --> 00:44:38.970
<v Speaker 2>People dropped without even getting</v>
<v Speaker 2>shot.</v>

959
00:44:38.980 --> 00:44:43.590
<v Speaker 2>They don't know what.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just freeze the sound of you being</v>

960
00:44:43.591 --> 00:44:47.430
<v Speaker 2>somewhere and being transferred to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>sounds of gunfire.</v>

961
00:44:47.910 --> 00:44:51.660
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking overwhelming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And some people get it and react to it.</v>

962
00:44:51.960 --> 00:44:53.850
<v Speaker 2>And some people just think it's the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fourth of July.</v>

963
00:44:54.130 --> 00:44:54.810
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

964
00:44:54.810 --> 00:44:58.430
<v Speaker 2>it's really weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I've seen people fucking dropped</v>

965
00:44:58.431 --> 00:45:02.280
<v Speaker 2>from fear dropped from fear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something that I was as a child when I</v>

966
00:45:02.281 --> 00:45:05.490
<v Speaker 2>was two blocks away from just people</v>
<v Speaker 2>dropping from fear,</v>

967
00:45:05.830 --> 00:45:08.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so like I remember when I lived in</v>

968
00:45:08.311 --> 00:45:11.580
<v Speaker 2>Aspen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have the Esi body guard academy and</v>

969
00:45:11.581 --> 00:45:15.740
<v Speaker 2>aspect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does that stand for?</v>

970
00:45:16.440 --> 00:45:19.950
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the guy supposedly was in a room six</v>

971
00:45:19.951 --> 00:45:23.910
<v Speaker 2>by 12 room where they killed 12 Mexicans</v>
<v Speaker 2>at knife point with his bands.</v>

972
00:45:24.330 --> 00:45:28.320
<v Speaker 2>So he opens up this Esi thing and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

973
00:45:28.321 --> 00:45:29.820
<v Speaker 2>it's 20 g's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

974
00:45:29.821 --> 00:45:32.820
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a summer long program and you learn</v>

975
00:45:32.821 --> 00:45:37.821
<v Speaker 2>how to adjust up or die out the tube and</v>
<v Speaker 2>drive and evasive driving and shooting.</v>

976
00:45:38.340 --> 00:45:42.090
<v Speaker 2>Then they have a course on maritime,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how to defend people out on the ocean</v>

977
00:45:42.510 --> 00:45:44.430
<v Speaker 2>and all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

978
00:45:44.610 --> 00:45:48.150
<v Speaker 2>she asked for it and all that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those places like woody creek where you</v>

979
00:45:48.151 --> 00:45:53.151
<v Speaker 2>went to his home,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the baddest retired soldiers in the</v>

980
00:45:54.361 --> 00:45:57.810
<v Speaker 2>world and you don't know who they are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just think that dude over there with</v>

981
00:45:57.811 --> 00:46:00.720
<v Speaker 2>the American flag is mowing the lawn</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I killed.</v>

982
00:46:00.721 --> 00:46:02.640
<v Speaker 2>80 people want to end them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bad Guy.</v>

983
00:46:02.710 --> 00:46:04.640
<v Speaker 2>There's a guy endeavor that I know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm telling you,</v>

984
00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:07.260
<v Speaker 2>Colorado is where they put them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why,</v>

985
00:46:07.300 --> 00:46:09.840
<v Speaker 2>why they put them in because the</v>
<v Speaker 2>mountains to keep them away from</v>

986
00:46:09.841 --> 00:46:13.720
<v Speaker 2>civilization for these people just in</v>
<v Speaker 2>case they get Chinese music somewhere.</v>

987
00:46:14.420 --> 00:46:17.940
<v Speaker 2>They don't ever want that to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Break glass in case of war.</v>

988
00:46:17.970 --> 00:46:21.240
<v Speaker 2>And there was a guy that came in that</v>
<v Speaker 2>was a marine that bro Joe,</v>

989
00:46:21.270 --> 00:46:23.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anybody comes in with stories.</v>

990
00:46:23.191 --> 00:46:25.620
<v Speaker 2>I know one thing when I see it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe it.</v>

991
00:46:25.950 --> 00:46:28.860
<v Speaker 2>The motherfucker used to get picked up</v>
<v Speaker 2>at Aspen and put him in the helicopter</v>

992
00:46:29.180 --> 00:46:31.230
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they sent like a helicopter with</v>

993
00:46:31.231 --> 00:46:35.610
<v Speaker 2>two guys jumping out for guys around</v>
<v Speaker 2>them and he was just waiting.</v>

994
00:46:35.611 --> 00:46:39.330
<v Speaker 2>But uncle Joey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was 19 and he would tell me stories</v>

995
00:46:39.331 --> 00:46:40.260
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

996
00:46:40.490 --> 00:46:45.490
<v Speaker 2>the green berets and all these guys were</v>
<v Speaker 2>sitting around a thing cooking chili and</v>

997
00:46:46.591 --> 00:46:50.150
<v Speaker 2>they will all tell telling how many</v>
<v Speaker 2>people they killed killed 18.</v>

998
00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:53.970
<v Speaker 2>I killed 22.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile he was stirring the soup with</v>

999
00:46:53.971 --> 00:46:56.670
<v Speaker 2>this big over the fire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>

1000
00:46:56.671 --> 00:46:59.340
<v Speaker 2>Like that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the type of stories this guy</v>

1001
00:46:59.341 --> 00:47:00.090
<v Speaker 2>would tell me.</v>

1002
00:47:00.090 --> 00:47:03.780
<v Speaker 2>He had me all fucked up in the head and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I asked him once I go,</v>

1003
00:47:03.781 --> 00:47:05.940
<v Speaker 2>should I go to that Esi?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he goes,</v>

1004
00:47:05.941 --> 00:47:08.880
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go in there and smack them all with my</v>

1005
00:47:08.881 --> 00:47:10.020
<v Speaker 2>left hand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If he goes,</v>

1006
00:47:10.320 --> 00:47:13.830
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't teach what you need to learn</v>

1007
00:47:13.831 --> 00:47:18.831
<v Speaker 2>over there because four years of Charlie</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the Bush is a lot better than 12</v>

1008
00:47:20.371 --> 00:47:23.040
<v Speaker 2>weeks of you hanging out with some white</v>
<v Speaker 2>dudes with suits,</v>

1009
00:47:23.041 --> 00:47:25.550
<v Speaker 2>shooting people targets and it's not</v>
<v Speaker 2>real.</v>

1010
00:47:25.590 --> 00:47:27.480
<v Speaker 2>It's not until there's real</v>
<v Speaker 2>consequences.</v>

1011
00:47:27.560 --> 00:47:30.100
<v Speaker 2>So that's why he said it just wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't you think</v>

1012
00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:32.290
<v Speaker 6>though it's better than nothing?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I would think that it's better than</v>

1013
00:47:32.291 --> 00:47:34.960
<v Speaker 6>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I would think that the best thing would</v>

1014
00:47:34.961 --> 00:47:39.250
<v Speaker 6>be actually being in bootcamp,</v>
<v Speaker 6>actually going to bud's actually being</v>

1015
00:47:39.251 --> 00:47:42.010
<v Speaker 6>in some sort of a situation.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We realized this is life,</v>

1016
00:47:42.040 --> 00:47:44.460
<v Speaker 6>this is real.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Whereas if you're,</v>

1017
00:47:44.610 --> 00:47:48.400
<v Speaker 6>if you're preparing like up in Colorado</v>
<v Speaker 6>and you just go through that course,</v>

1018
00:47:48.880 --> 00:47:52.030
<v Speaker 6>you might have some things in your mind,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but that's one of the things like people</v>

1019
00:47:52.031 --> 00:47:53.770
<v Speaker 6>say to me like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

1020
00:47:53.771 --> 00:47:57.160
<v Speaker 6>should I take a self defense class?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like when they show you how to kick</v>

1021
00:47:57.161 --> 00:47:58.030
<v Speaker 6>somebody in the name,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I go,</v>

1022
00:47:58.031 --> 00:48:01.510
<v Speaker 6>listen to me.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That shit is not going to like,</v>

1023
00:48:01.570 --> 00:48:03.820
<v Speaker 6>there was,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there was a guy on the fucking radio</v>

1024
00:48:03.940 --> 00:48:05.770
<v Speaker 6>that was,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he was always talking about,</v>

1025
00:48:05.771 --> 00:48:06.604
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

1026
00:48:07.410 --> 00:48:10.260
<v Speaker 6>it was on opiod anthony show back in the</v>
<v Speaker 6>day and he was always talking about this</v>

1027
00:48:10.270 --> 00:48:14.080
<v Speaker 6>difference between the street and a</v>
<v Speaker 6>martial arts and martial arts</v>

1028
00:48:14.140 --> 00:48:14.680
<v Speaker 6>tournaments.</v>

1029
00:48:14.680 --> 00:48:17.590
<v Speaker 6>There's no rules in the street.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's no rules.</v>

1030

<v Speaker 6>Anderson Silva from kicking you across</v>
<v Speaker 6>the room.</v>

<v Speaker 6>enough to him,</v>

1040
00:48:40.030 --> 00:48:41.560
<v Speaker 6>and if he does let you get close enough</v>
<v Speaker 6>to him,</v>

<v Speaker 6>the shortcut is like street defense.</v>

1071
00:50:04.190 --> 00:50:08.680
<v Speaker 6>these ridiculous ideas that you're going</v>
<v Speaker 6>to be able to defend yourself with some</v>

1072
00:50:08.681 --> 00:50:10.270
<v Speaker 6>tricks.</v>

1097
00:51:08.740 --> 00:51:13.010
<v Speaker 6>six minute workout and then they keep</v>
<v Speaker 6>beating each other like by one minute we</v>

1098
00:51:13.011 --> 00:51:15.830
<v Speaker 6>have the sick,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but we have the five minute workout and</v>

1099

<v Speaker 6>you know what man?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Half of America buys into that.</v>

1100
00:51:18.710 --> 00:51:20.930
<v Speaker 6>A lot of America buys into the sap</v>
<v Speaker 6>pills.</v>

1101
00:51:20.960 --> 00:51:22.850
<v Speaker 6>That's the sad thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And once again,</v>

1102
00:51:22.851 --> 00:51:24.500
<v Speaker 6>if you want me to go back to what we</v>
<v Speaker 6>discussed before,</v>

1103
00:51:24.530 --> 00:51:25.940
<v Speaker 6>it's not about us.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So you know,</v>

1104
00:51:26.570 --> 00:51:28.550
<v Speaker 6>you're breathing out,</v>
<v Speaker 6>comfortable.</v>

1105
00:51:28.560 --> 00:51:31.970
<v Speaker 6>You on the situation.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I always give because I believe I've</v>

1106
00:51:31.971 --> 00:51:33.200
<v Speaker 6>been there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know you guys,</v>

1107
00:51:33.201 --> 00:51:37.460
<v Speaker 6>but sometime you want,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you desire to date someone so badly and</v>

1108
00:51:37.461 --> 00:51:40.330
<v Speaker 6>you get so excited when you get it and</v>
<v Speaker 6>the first day that you go,</v>

1109
00:51:40.340 --> 00:51:42.110
<v Speaker 6>you feel like you cannot even move,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1110
00:51:42.770 --> 00:51:46.010
<v Speaker 6>panic.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And if you remember that day,</v>

1111
00:51:46.670 --> 00:51:48.080
<v Speaker 6>it doesn't work the way that you want</v>
<v Speaker 6>to.</v>

1112
00:51:48.081 --> 00:51:48.741
<v Speaker 6>You,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you pray,</v>

1113
00:51:48.741 --> 00:51:52.190
<v Speaker 6>they go to work,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but after you pass the first shot.</v>

1114
00:51:52.380 --> 00:51:54.140
<v Speaker 6>But the second,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the third is become better.</v>

1115
00:51:54.260 --> 00:51:56.420
<v Speaker 6>It's exercising and breathing control.</v>
<v Speaker 6>These are the same,</v>

1116
00:51:56.421 --> 00:51:57.950
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>once you get used to,</v>

1117
00:51:58.040 --> 00:52:00.020
<v Speaker 6>everything's comfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's just,</v>

1118
00:52:00.021 --> 00:52:02.300
<v Speaker 6>that's a big thing with again,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what we were talking about with</v>

1119
00:52:02.301 --> 00:52:03.020
<v Speaker 6>fighting.</v>

1120
00:52:03.020 --> 00:52:03.950
<v Speaker 6>When I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when I,</v>

1121
00:52:03.951 --> 00:52:05.810
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I had one time where I tore a muscle.</v>

1122
00:52:06.250 --> 00:52:09.380
<v Speaker 6>I didn't compete for like six months.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was like the longest time I'd ever</v>

1123
00:52:09.381 --> 00:52:13.820
<v Speaker 6>gone without competing because I tore</v>
<v Speaker 6>the muscle that connects the groin to</v>

1124
00:52:13.821 --> 00:52:14.654
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

1125
00:52:14.690 --> 00:52:17.690
<v Speaker 6>I think it's called a Satorius muscle.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like at the top of the leg.</v>

1126
00:52:17.691 --> 00:52:19.490
<v Speaker 6>It was real bad.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I couldn't throw any kicks at all.</v>

1127
00:52:19.640 --> 00:52:21.950
<v Speaker 6>I can only do my workouts in the pool</v>
<v Speaker 6>was pretty bad.</v>

1128
00:52:22.340 --> 00:52:26.450
<v Speaker 6>And so when I was recovering from that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when I got back in the,</v>

1129
00:52:26.800 --> 00:52:28.850
<v Speaker 6>my first fight back,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was like,</v>

1130
00:52:28.851 --> 00:52:30.950
<v Speaker 6>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it just feels so off.</v>

1131
00:52:30.951 --> 00:52:33.230
<v Speaker 6>My timing feels off.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Everything feels weird.</v>

1132
00:52:33.470 --> 00:52:38.060
<v Speaker 6>But then I fought again less than a</v>
<v Speaker 6>month later and I felt great like less</v>

1133
00:52:38.061 --> 00:52:39.320
<v Speaker 6>than a month later.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Everything was like,</v>

1134
00:52:39.321 --> 00:52:40.370
<v Speaker 6>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I know this again,</v>

1135
00:52:40.460 --> 00:52:41.570
<v Speaker 6>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is my thing.</v>

1136
00:52:41.571 --> 00:52:42.470
<v Speaker 6>I've been here before.</v>

1137
00:52:42.770 --> 00:52:46.110
<v Speaker 6>And then it felt normal again.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like when you were,</v>

1138
00:52:46.140 --> 00:52:48.410
<v Speaker 6>when you have a girlfriend,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you have a girlfriend for a long</v>

1139
00:52:48.411 --> 00:52:50.030
<v Speaker 6>time,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you don't get nervous about whether or</v>

1140
00:52:50.031 --> 00:52:51.830
<v Speaker 6>not you're going to get it up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You don't panic.</v>

1141
00:52:51.831 --> 00:52:53.990
<v Speaker 6>Like we hope she looked at me.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She fucking likes you.</v>

1142
00:52:53.991 --> 00:52:55.740
<v Speaker 6>She's naked,</v>
<v Speaker 6>she's right there.</v>

1143
00:52:55.741 --> 00:52:57.310
<v Speaker 6>She's been with you forever.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

1144
00:52:57.320 --> 00:52:59.210
<v Speaker 6>she likes you so it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's not an issue,</v>

1145
00:52:59.390 --> 00:53:00.830
<v Speaker 6>but if you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if it is,</v>

1146
00:53:00.831 --> 00:53:02.450
<v Speaker 6>like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a curl that you've been thinking about</v>

1147
00:53:02.451 --> 00:53:05.810
<v Speaker 6>for the longest time and you're only</v>
<v Speaker 6>going to grow and I hope those schools</v>

1148
00:53:05.811 --> 00:53:10.811
<v Speaker 6>will whoop and then you finally get</v>
<v Speaker 6>weather like this panic and the,</v>

1149
00:53:13.141 --> 00:53:15.860
<v Speaker 6>the human penis is such a fucking odd</v>
<v Speaker 6>thing in that regard.</v>

1150
00:53:15.920 --> 00:53:17.870
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's what a bizarre thing.</v>

1151
00:53:17.990 --> 00:53:20.330
<v Speaker 6>It's designed to make sure like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>look dude,</v>

1152
00:53:20.331 --> 00:53:22.430
<v Speaker 6>if you ain't come,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're not going to fuck.</v>

1153
00:53:22.590 --> 00:53:25.890
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Because we don't want any weak ass</v>

1154
00:53:25.920 --> 00:53:26.400
<v Speaker 6>nervous</v>

1155
00:53:26.400 --> 00:53:30.510
<v Speaker 3>bitches out there make it babies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the system is built to make sure that</v>

1156
00:53:30.511 --> 00:53:33.210
<v Speaker 3>you're an addict is not get hard if you</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking panicking.</v>

1157
00:53:33.570 --> 00:53:37.110
<v Speaker 3>It's not like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not like a Rhino Horn were armed</v>

1158
00:53:37.111 --> 00:53:38.510
<v Speaker 3>and ready at all times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1159
00:53:38.511 --> 00:53:42.330
<v Speaker 3>it's not like a very specific</v>
<v Speaker 3>physiological process has to be in place</v>

1160
00:53:42.450 --> 00:53:45.450
<v Speaker 3>with the softest part of your body</v>
<v Speaker 3>becomes hard,</v>

1161
00:53:45.451 --> 00:53:49.320
<v Speaker 3>like a fucking rock like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The process itself is crazy.</v>

1162
00:53:49.620 --> 00:53:53.160
<v Speaker 3>When you look at your Dick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you go into p and it's this soft</v>

1163
00:53:53.161 --> 00:53:57.090
<v Speaker 3>little spongy thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you grab your Dick when it's at</v>

1164
00:53:57.120 --> 00:54:00.540
<v Speaker 3>full mast and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how is it the same thing?</v>

1165
00:54:00.750 --> 00:54:05.750
<v Speaker 3>Because it's this crazy physiological</v>
<v Speaker 3>process that only works if you're ready</v>

1166
00:54:05.881 --> 00:54:06.790
<v Speaker 3>to rock.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1167
00:54:06.870 --> 00:54:08.700
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't be faking it like you,</v>

1168
00:54:08.701 --> 00:54:11.010
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your body knows if you're panicking,</v>

1169
00:54:11.150 --> 00:54:11.983
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>

1170
00:54:12.050 --> 00:54:13.020
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a book,</v>

1171
00:54:13.030 --> 00:54:15.240
<v Speaker 3>there's a book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how you translate it in</v>

1172
00:54:15.241 --> 00:54:17.020
<v Speaker 3>English,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this is a book of this plane.</v>

1173
00:54:17.100 --> 00:54:20.190
<v Speaker 3>So was so simple about those reactions</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the body under stress.</v>

1174
00:54:20.220 --> 00:54:23.320
<v Speaker 3>And he say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>think about the Zebra on the savannah.</v>

1175
00:54:24.210 --> 00:54:25.580
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's exactly.</v>

1176
00:54:25.610 --> 00:54:27.330
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you have someone that's choosing</v>

1177
00:54:27.331 --> 00:54:30.440
<v Speaker 3>you to hit you and when you are under</v>
<v Speaker 3>stress,</v>

1178
00:54:30.441 --> 00:54:33.480
<v Speaker 3>I stress your body stops.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stop producing hormones like</v>

1179
00:54:33.481 --> 00:54:36.600
<v Speaker 3>testosterone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why you don't the last thing you want to</v>

1180
00:54:36.601 --> 00:54:41.360
<v Speaker 3>have sex and when some lions behind you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's exactly what he's doing is</v>

1181
00:54:41.370 --> 00:54:45.900
<v Speaker 3>shutting down whatever is needed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shutting down everything under stress.</v>

1182
00:54:45.901 --> 00:54:47.240
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you are freaking out,</v>

1183
00:54:47.320 --> 00:54:49.080
<v Speaker 3>you can perform.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can portfolio.</v>

1184
00:54:49.081 --> 00:54:49.900
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually I'll,</v>

1185
00:54:49.900 --> 00:54:54.900
<v Speaker 3>confidentially zebras are so bizarre</v>
<v Speaker 3>because the you see the way their body</v>

1186
00:54:54.961 --> 00:54:59.961
<v Speaker 3>looks like they're not camouflage at all</v>
<v Speaker 3>like white with black stripes on and for</v>

1187
00:55:02.371 --> 00:55:06.180
<v Speaker 3>the longest time they thought that the</v>
<v Speaker 3>white with black stripes on would</v>

1188
00:55:06.181 --> 00:55:09.330
<v Speaker 3>confuse and animals mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there's a type of Cammo.</v>

1189
00:55:09.480 --> 00:55:12.260
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever heard of a sat cammo as a</v>
<v Speaker 3>type of camouflage?</v>

1190
00:55:12.261 --> 00:55:16.160
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't look like trees or anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just a bunch of black and brown</v>

1191
00:55:16.170 --> 00:55:19.700
<v Speaker 3>lines and those lines for animals</v>
<v Speaker 3>because animals there,</v>

1192
00:55:20.030 --> 00:55:23.820
<v Speaker 3>their eyes operate on edge detection.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They operate on a lot of them,</v>

1193
00:55:23.910 --> 00:55:26.880
<v Speaker 3>especially prey animals like deer and</v>
<v Speaker 3>things along those lines.</v>

1194
00:55:27.170 --> 00:55:27.790
<v Speaker 3>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

1195
00:55:27.790 --> 00:55:29.310
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they see movement.</v>

1196
00:55:29.490 --> 00:55:32.520
<v Speaker 3>They don't necessarily see things the</v>
<v Speaker 3>way you see things.</v>

1197
00:55:32.670 --> 00:55:36.330
<v Speaker 3>They mostly just see movement and so for</v>
<v Speaker 3>the longest time they thought,</v>

1198
00:55:36.331 --> 00:55:40.230
<v Speaker 3>well maybe when you're looking like a</v>
<v Speaker 3>lion is looking at a zebra,</v>

1199
00:55:40.620 --> 00:55:45.000
<v Speaker 3>the lion is seeing the zebras body and</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's all the lines confused so he</v>

1200
00:55:45.001 --> 00:55:47.190
<v Speaker 3>can't see it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then they realized,</v>

1201
00:55:47.370 --> 00:55:48.001
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1202
00:55:48.001 --> 00:55:51.090
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What it actually is is you can't pick</v>

1203
00:55:51.091 --> 00:55:56.091
<v Speaker 3>out individually zebras.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like if an individual zebra like it</v>

1204
00:55:57.130 --> 00:56:00.930
<v Speaker 3>looks different from the other zebras,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the one that they get after,</v>

1205
00:56:00.960 --> 00:56:05.070
<v Speaker 3>like if one's ears bleeding and as blood</v>
<v Speaker 3>on his body and it looks different from</v>

1206
00:56:05.071 --> 00:56:06.990
<v Speaker 3>all those other white and black lines.</v>

1207
00:56:07.170 --> 00:56:09.390
<v Speaker 3>That's the one they targeted,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is kind of fucked.</v>

1208
00:56:09.570 --> 00:56:12.570
<v Speaker 3>And one of the ways they found out this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they tagged a zebra,</v>

1209
00:56:12.840 --> 00:56:16.620
<v Speaker 3>they put like an ear tag on a zebra and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they sent Jordan Peterson was talking</v>

1210
00:56:16.621 --> 00:56:18.540
<v Speaker 3>about this recently in this video and</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1211
00:56:18.550 --> 00:56:22.320
<v Speaker 3>they put it back into the herd and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>lines immediately killed at Zebra.</v>

1212
00:56:22.530 --> 00:56:24.730
<v Speaker 3>That's the one they went right to</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it had something different.</v>

1213
00:56:25.120 --> 00:56:27.970
<v Speaker 3>Like did you see all this book?</v>
<v Speaker 3>White and black lines?</v>

1214
00:56:27.971 --> 00:56:28.481
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1215
00:56:28.481 --> 00:56:30.490
<v Speaker 3>this motherfucker's got an ear tag,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get them.</v>

1216
00:56:30.780 --> 00:56:32.620
<v Speaker 3>And he just went right after that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's,</v>

1217
00:56:32.890 --> 00:56:34.360
<v Speaker 3>it's really designed like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

1218
00:56:34.390 --> 00:56:35.860
<v Speaker 3>we know we're get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're fucked,</v>

1219
00:56:35.920 --> 00:56:38.590
<v Speaker 3>we're born fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if we stay together,</v>

1220
00:56:38.920 --> 00:56:41.540
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe with like look when you see that.</v>

1221
00:56:41.970 --> 00:56:44.950
<v Speaker 3>So when you see all those ears together,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's super confusing.</v>

1222
00:56:45.280 --> 00:56:47.960
<v Speaker 3>While we will have this fucking TV fixed</v>
<v Speaker 3>soon,</v>

1223
00:56:47.980 --> 00:56:50.310
<v Speaker 3>I swear I'm this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

1224
00:56:50.740 --> 00:56:53.130
<v Speaker 3>this TV cuts in and out that one pack.</v>

1225
00:56:54.220 --> 00:56:57.400
<v Speaker 3>So when you see these zebras and we see</v>
<v Speaker 3>these lines,</v>

1226
00:56:57.550 --> 00:57:02.170
<v Speaker 3>what it's designed to do is confuse the</v>
<v Speaker 3>lions so that they don't know which one</v>

1227
00:57:02.171 --> 00:57:04.150
<v Speaker 3>to target,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is crazy,</v>

1228
00:57:04.780 --> 00:57:06.640
<v Speaker 3>but if one of those motherfuckers had an</v>
<v Speaker 3>ear tag,</v>

1229
00:57:06.641 --> 00:57:08.560
<v Speaker 3>a big old yellow tag hanging off their</v>
<v Speaker 3>ear,</v>

1230
00:57:09.220 --> 00:57:10.780
<v Speaker 3>the lines would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there you are a bitch.</v>

1231
00:57:10.810 --> 00:57:13.300
<v Speaker 3>I see you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's kind of cool.</v>

1232
00:57:13.330 --> 00:57:14.980
<v Speaker 3>It's fun though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1233
00:57:14.981 --> 00:57:17.170
<v Speaker 3>what a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what a terrible situation.</v>

1234
00:57:17.171 --> 00:57:21.370
<v Speaker 3>Nature has given these poor things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The lions are camouflaged.</v>

1235
00:57:21.700 --> 00:57:24.550
<v Speaker 3>The lions look like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The brown grasses,</v>

1236
00:57:24.940 --> 00:57:27.340
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and leopard or excuse me,</v>

1237
00:57:27.341 --> 00:57:32.341
<v Speaker 3>a tiger's apparently that whole stripe</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing with them is also to make them</v>

1238
00:57:33.431 --> 00:57:37.180
<v Speaker 3>blend in with all their surroundings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the trees and the sticks.</v>

1239
00:57:37.181 --> 00:57:38.710
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they live mostly in the jungle.</v>

1240
00:57:40.450 --> 00:57:44.270
<v Speaker 3>So you were asking me before this about</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fights this weekend.</v>

1241
00:57:44.330 --> 00:57:46.760
<v Speaker 3>What do you think would be good context</v>
<v Speaker 3>that occurred?</v>

1242
00:57:46.800 --> 00:57:49.100
<v Speaker 3>That's why they keep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1243
00:57:49.410 --> 00:57:53.170
<v Speaker 3>they'd know except that it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is what I think a lot of people</v>

1244
00:57:53.171 --> 00:57:55.330
<v Speaker 3>were like pissed off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was boring,</v>

1245
00:57:55.390 --> 00:57:58.570
<v Speaker 3>but I think that's because they just</v>
<v Speaker 3>want to see people beat the fuck out of</v>

1246
00:57:58.571 --> 00:57:59.800
<v Speaker 3>each other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I understand.</v>

1247
00:57:59.801 --> 00:58:02.290
<v Speaker 3>That's why you tune into cage fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But to me,</v>

1248
00:58:02.470 --> 00:58:07.470
<v Speaker 3>the way I always described martial arts</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it's high level problem solving with</v>

1249
00:58:07.541 --> 00:58:11.650
<v Speaker 3>dire physical consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you run in on Tyron Woodley,</v>

1250
00:58:11.651 --> 00:58:15.640
<v Speaker 3>you got some dire physical consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a fucking powerhouse.</v>

1251
00:58:15.850 --> 00:58:20.800
<v Speaker 3>And if Woodley charges at Thompson,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this dire physical consequences because</v>

1252
00:58:20.801 --> 00:58:24.040
<v Speaker 3>he was getting tagged when he would he</v>
<v Speaker 3>need said it to me after the fight.</v>

1253
00:58:24.041 --> 00:58:26.050
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he caught me a few times as I was</v>

1254
00:58:26.051 --> 00:58:30.490
<v Speaker 3>charging towards him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So Woodley has a different style and</v>

1255
00:58:30.491 --> 00:58:34.900
<v Speaker 3>Thompson Thompson has that wide stance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that karate style and he's excellent at</v>

1256
00:58:34.901 --> 00:58:37.750
<v Speaker 3>moving in and moving out and almost like</v>
<v Speaker 3>point fighting you.</v>

1257
00:58:37.970 --> 00:58:40.210
<v Speaker 3>He just jabbing you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hitting you with these,</v>

1258
00:58:40.211 --> 00:58:41.050
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>clean,</v>

1259
00:58:41.060 --> 00:58:44.770
<v Speaker 3>lefthand sliding out of the way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Occasionally throwing kicks.</v>

1260
00:58:44.920 --> 00:58:48.760
<v Speaker 3>But mostly what he's doing is making you</v>
<v Speaker 3>wonder what he's going to do.</v>

1261
00:58:48.761 --> 00:58:52.150
<v Speaker 3>And when he's coming at you and woody</v>
<v Speaker 3>had to pick his battles and figure out</v>

1262
00:58:52.151 --> 00:58:53.580
<v Speaker 3>when he could launch himself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Adam.</v>

1263
00:58:54.040 --> 00:58:56.950
<v Speaker 3>So at any moment something could have</v>
<v Speaker 3>happened,</v>

1264
00:58:57.220 --> 00:59:00.940
<v Speaker 3>but a lot of shit didn't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the people watching at home like that</v>

1265
00:59:00.941 --> 00:59:04.900
<v Speaker 3>was the most boring fight over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's because those moments are so</v>

1266
00:59:04.960 --> 00:59:07.690
<v Speaker 3>critical.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those moments are so dangerous.</v>

1267
00:59:07.870 --> 00:59:11.500
<v Speaker 3>You can't just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They would like it to be like Frankie</v>

1268
00:59:11.500 --> 00:59:13.970
<v Speaker 3>Edgar Gray Maynard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just fucking chaos or punches thrown</v>

1269
00:59:13.990 --> 00:59:16.420
<v Speaker 3>wild.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not going to happen like that.</v>

1270
00:59:16.450 --> 00:59:19.120
<v Speaker 3>You can't do that with wonderboy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't charge at him like that.</v>

1271
00:59:19.240 --> 00:59:21.260
<v Speaker 3>He will fucking counter you and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

1272
00:59:21.430 --> 00:59:23.420
<v Speaker 3>you will be one of those people on his</v>
<v Speaker 3>highlight reel.</v>

1273
00:59:23.630 --> 00:59:27.950
<v Speaker 3>So tyron Woodley was very smart and that</v>
<v Speaker 3>he knew that he couldn't charge Adam and</v>

1274
00:59:28.040 --> 00:59:31.100
<v Speaker 3>wonderboy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's not going to charge a willy either.</v>

1275
00:59:31.101 --> 00:59:33.050
<v Speaker 3>I mean he got almost knocked the fuck</v>
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>

1276
00:59:33.051 --> 00:59:35.280
<v Speaker 3>And the first fight he almost got</v>
<v Speaker 3>knocked the fuck out.</v>

1277
00:59:35.300 --> 00:59:39.800
<v Speaker 3>And in the fifth round of the second</v>
<v Speaker 3>fight to Woodley's a powerhouse man,</v>

1278
00:59:39.801 --> 00:59:43.640
<v Speaker 3>he hits so God damn hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So everybody had to be on their toes.</v>

1279
00:59:43.670 --> 00:59:47.300
<v Speaker 3>They both had to be minding their p's</v>
<v Speaker 3>and q's and that translated for a boring</v>

1280
00:59:47.301 --> 00:59:49.730
<v Speaker 3>fight to a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but not to me.</v>

1281
00:59:50.060 --> 00:59:50.930
<v Speaker 3>To me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

1282
00:59:50.990 --> 00:59:54.250
<v Speaker 3>anything could happen at any moment in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fifth round or almost did when,</v>

1283
00:59:54.340 --> 00:59:56.630
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when Woodley connected and Thompson's</v>

1284
00:59:56.631 --> 00:59:58.520
<v Speaker 3>knees went out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean he slumped.</v>

1285
00:59:58.521 --> 00:59:59.450
<v Speaker 3>He was out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1286
00:59:59.570 --> 01:00:02.330
<v Speaker 3>He was out for at least a half,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a second or a moment,</v>

1287
01:00:02.331 --> 01:00:05.030
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a moment where his legs gave</v>

1288
01:00:05.031 --> 01:00:05.510
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>

1289
01:00:05.510 --> 01:00:08.810
<v Speaker 3>His body went limp and they could've</v>
<v Speaker 3>stopped the fight right there.</v>

1290
01:00:08.930 --> 01:00:10.760
<v Speaker 3>I'm glad they didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Glad they kept going.</v>

1291
01:00:11.330 --> 01:00:15.050
<v Speaker 3>I talked to a big John McCarthy in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>cage after the fight ago.</v>

1292
01:00:15.170 --> 01:00:16.420
<v Speaker 3>How close we are to stop with that</v>
<v Speaker 3>fight.</v>

1293
01:00:16.421 --> 01:00:17.660
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he goes,</v>

1294
01:00:17.661 --> 01:00:18.910
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't close to stopping that fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>

1295
01:00:18.940 --> 01:00:19.611
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You were looking,</v>

1296
01:00:19.611 --> 01:00:20.240
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

1297
01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:22.620
<v Speaker 3>I was looking go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You were looking to close.</v>

1298
01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:24.480
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll never admitted it goes,</v>

1299
01:00:24.530 --> 01:00:25.370
<v Speaker 3>but it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1300
01:00:25.371 --> 01:00:26.510
<v Speaker 3>he was almost out right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

1301
01:00:26.511 --> 01:00:28.430
<v Speaker 3>he was almost out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It might have been out for half a</v>

1302
01:00:28.431 --> 01:00:29.450
<v Speaker 3>second,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he,</v>

1303
01:00:29.451 --> 01:00:30.460
<v Speaker 3>I gave him a chance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>

1304
01:00:30.461 --> 01:00:32.360
<v Speaker 3>you did a great job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He did an amazing job.</v>

1305
01:00:32.690 --> 01:00:35.210
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's why big John Mccarthy so</v>
<v Speaker 3>important.</v>

1306
01:00:35.420 --> 01:00:38.600
<v Speaker 3>That guy with that kind of experience</v>
<v Speaker 3>and if he fucked that up everybody would</v>

1307
01:00:38.601 --> 01:00:39.530
<v Speaker 3>be so mad at him.</v>

1308
01:00:39.710 --> 01:00:41.900
<v Speaker 3>But he did it perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was perfect.</v>

1309
01:00:42.200 --> 01:00:45.830
<v Speaker 3>He has the most difficult job in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>sport other than the fighters.</v>

1310
01:00:46.040 --> 01:00:49.490
<v Speaker 3>Fighters have the most difficult job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Second most difficult job is the</v>

1311
01:00:49.491 --> 01:00:51.970
<v Speaker 3>referee.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Third most difficult job is the judges</v>

1312
01:00:52.320 --> 01:00:53.780
<v Speaker 3>really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think so.</v>

1313
01:00:53.930 --> 01:00:56.180
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe is going to interpret that</v>

1314
01:00:56.720 --> 01:00:59.450
<v Speaker 3>trauma for the other people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well he has to be.</v>

1315
01:00:59.480 --> 01:01:01.460
<v Speaker 3>He has to look.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He has to be at the right angle.</v>

1316
01:01:01.580 --> 01:01:05.480
<v Speaker 3>Like they're moving around and they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>fast and they could go to his left and</v>

1317
01:01:05.481 --> 01:01:07.460
<v Speaker 3>he can be over here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but something could be happening.</v>

1318
01:01:07.461 --> 01:01:08.241
<v Speaker 3>I'm there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1319
01:01:08.241 --> 01:01:10.040
<v Speaker 3>And he doesn't even see it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1320
01:01:10.041 --> 01:01:12.380
<v Speaker 3>you don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like sometimes sometimes guys don't see</v>

1321
01:01:12.381 --> 01:01:15.410
<v Speaker 3>taps.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes guys don't see a certain I</v>

1322
01:01:15.411 --> 01:01:18.470
<v Speaker 3>pokes or groin shots.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of things that can happen.</v>

1323
01:01:18.500 --> 01:01:23.450
<v Speaker 3>A referee's job is insanely difficult</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they only get praised when they fuck</v>

1324
01:01:23.451 --> 01:01:24.210
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>

1325
01:01:24.210 --> 01:01:26.060
<v Speaker 3>They only rather get attention when they</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck up.</v>

1326
01:01:26.180 --> 01:01:30.620
<v Speaker 3>They don't get any praise when they do a</v>
<v Speaker 3>great job and just just they need more.</v>

1327
01:01:31.180 --> 01:01:34.550
<v Speaker 3>They need more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>More people need to understand like how</v>

1328
01:01:34.551 --> 01:01:38.810
<v Speaker 3>difficult that is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that moment where tyron finally did</v>

1329
01:01:38.811 --> 01:01:41.090
<v Speaker 3>connect on wonderboy and everybody's</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1330
01:01:41.091 --> 01:01:43.220
<v Speaker 3>why didn't you do that earlier?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because you could have got knocked the</v>

1331
01:01:43.221 --> 01:01:45.860
<v Speaker 3>fuck out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that was where the opening was.</v>

1332
01:01:46.130 --> 01:01:50.360
<v Speaker 3>Woodley was so aggressive because he was</v>
<v Speaker 3>down on the score cards at least in his</v>

1333
01:01:50.361 --> 01:01:53.480
<v Speaker 3>corner of his eyes and in my eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was as well and he had a charge</v>

1334
01:01:53.481 --> 01:01:55.790
<v Speaker 3>forward and he had to connect and he</v>
<v Speaker 3>did,</v>

1335
01:01:56.180 --> 01:02:00.200
<v Speaker 3>but to make that happen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of things have to be in place.</v>

1336
01:02:00.201 --> 01:02:01.940
<v Speaker 3>You have to understand wonder boys</v>
<v Speaker 3>timing.</v>

1337
01:02:02.150 --> 01:02:04.460
<v Speaker 3>He had been fighting him for four rounds</v>
<v Speaker 3>already.</v>

1338
01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:07.340
<v Speaker 3>He was getting a sense of what wonder</v>
<v Speaker 3>boy could and couldn't do.</v>

1339
01:02:07.490 --> 01:02:10.880
<v Speaker 3>He also knew the consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He'd been tagged a couple of times so he</v>

1340
01:02:10.881 --> 01:02:14.540
<v Speaker 3>knew like I can't just rush at them</v>
<v Speaker 3>because wonderboy was trying to tie them</v>

1341
01:02:14.541 --> 01:02:16.920
<v Speaker 3>with that right hook.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was standing on the South Pole</v>

1342
01:02:16.921 --> 01:02:20.010
<v Speaker 3>position with his right leg forward.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He throws that front side kick to the</v>

1343
01:02:20.011 --> 01:02:22.050
<v Speaker 3>body,</v>
<v Speaker 3>throws it really well because he,</v>

1344
01:02:22.350 --> 01:02:27.350
<v Speaker 3>he picks it up from the ground like low</v>
<v Speaker 3>and and sort of scoops up so you don't</v>

1345
01:02:27.781 --> 01:02:31.260
<v Speaker 3>see it coming until it's too late.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It might not be the most powerful</v>

1346
01:02:31.261 --> 01:02:34.020
<v Speaker 3>application of the front leg side kick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's very.</v>

1347
01:02:34.170 --> 01:02:38.700
<v Speaker 3>It's very sneaky because he slides in</v>
<v Speaker 3>with that foot low and then it comes up</v>

1348
01:02:38.701 --> 01:02:42.180
<v Speaker 3>and stabs you and you don't know if it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to come up as a sidekick or if</v>

1349
01:02:42.181 --> 01:02:44.550
<v Speaker 3>it's going to go up and over your</v>
<v Speaker 3>shoulders around kick.</v>

1350
01:02:44.790 --> 01:02:45.660
<v Speaker 3>You don't know what he's doing.</v>

1351
01:02:45.810 --> 01:02:50.460
<v Speaker 3>He's so sneaky.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So tyron had to be very cautious and for</v>

1352
01:02:50.461 --> 01:02:52.110
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people it was very boring</v>
<v Speaker 3>because of that,</v>

1353
01:02:52.770 --> 01:02:54.420
<v Speaker 3>but I didn't think it was boring was</v>
<v Speaker 3>happening.</v>

1354
01:02:54.430 --> 01:02:56.670
<v Speaker 3>I was on the edge of my seat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was just like,</v>

1355
01:02:56.671 --> 01:02:58.650
<v Speaker 3>there are moments.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's going to be moments when the</v>

1356
01:02:58.651 --> 01:03:02.820
<v Speaker 3>shit starts flying and in those moments,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's where the fight becomes amazing,</v>

1357
01:03:03.060 --> 01:03:07.220
<v Speaker 3>but those guys are smart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not dumb in the belt is so God</v>

1358
01:03:07.221 --> 01:03:09.000
<v Speaker 3>damn important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you have the belt,</v>

1359
01:03:09.210 --> 01:03:11.640
<v Speaker 3>you get to decide,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you fight all the best fighters,</v>

1360
01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:12.311
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1361
01:03:12.311 --> 01:03:13.830
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you make the money,</v>

1362
01:03:13.950 --> 01:03:15.870
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get the opportunities for the big</v>

1363
01:03:15.871 --> 01:03:17.640
<v Speaker 3>money fights,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the conor mcgregor type fights.</v>

1364
01:03:17.641 --> 01:03:20.100
<v Speaker 3>Those only happen if you have the belt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you don't have the belt,</v>

1365
01:03:20.101 --> 01:03:23.640
<v Speaker 3>nobody gives a fuck about you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So for a guy like Tyron,</v>

1366
01:03:23.641 --> 01:03:25.200
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that belt is everything.</v>

1367
01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:27.930
<v Speaker 3>For a guy like woody or a guy like a</v>
<v Speaker 3>wonderboy,</v>

1368
01:03:27.931 --> 01:03:29.280
<v Speaker 3>rather,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that belt is everything.</v>

1369
01:03:29.300 --> 01:03:32.100
<v Speaker 3>If you don't have that belt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you make a fraction of what you make.</v>

1370
01:03:32.250 --> 01:03:34.150
<v Speaker 3>Like think about that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fight that fight.</v>

1371
01:03:34.151 --> 01:03:36.180
<v Speaker 3>It's insanely close.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was so close.</v>

1372
01:03:36.450 --> 01:03:39.420
<v Speaker 3>Dominick Cruz afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's basically the same fight as the</v>

1373
01:03:39.421 --> 01:03:40.254
<v Speaker 3>first fight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1374
01:03:40.260 --> 01:03:42.510
<v Speaker 3>It's like you could call if you've</v>
<v Speaker 3>called the first fight of draw,</v>

1375
01:03:42.750 --> 01:03:45.550
<v Speaker 3>you could easily call this fight a draw</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I agree with him in.</v>

1376
01:03:45.690 --> 01:03:50.690
<v Speaker 3>So that means that wonderboy and Woodley</v>
<v Speaker 3>are essentially like so closely matched</v>

1377
01:03:50.790 --> 01:03:53.550
<v Speaker 3>stylistically that it's a wash.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1378
01:03:53.880 --> 01:03:55.920
<v Speaker 3>But meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Woodley's the one who's the champion,</v>

1379
01:03:56.040 --> 01:03:57.540
<v Speaker 3>will,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's the one who has the potential to</v>

1380
01:03:57.541 --> 01:03:59.460
<v Speaker 3>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Conor McGregor Woodley is the one who</v>

1381
01:03:59.461 --> 01:04:02.580
<v Speaker 3>has a potential to fight Michael Bisping</v>
<v Speaker 3>or whoever who else he fights at</v>

1382
01:04:02.581 --> 01:04:05.670
<v Speaker 3>whatever he fights at and that is where</v>
<v Speaker 3>the money is.</v>

1383
01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:07.500
<v Speaker 3>So he's the guy who's going to get the</v>
<v Speaker 3>money.</v>

1384
01:04:07.770 --> 01:04:12.770
<v Speaker 3>Whereas wonderboy who essentially had a</v>
<v Speaker 3>draw with him prove that he was at least</v>

1385
01:04:12.930 --> 01:04:17.580
<v Speaker 3>close enough on one fight and just a</v>
<v Speaker 3>hair under the second fight,</v>

1386
01:04:17.970 --> 01:04:18.750
<v Speaker 3>he ma,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's gonna,</v>

1387
01:04:18.750 --> 01:04:23.750
<v Speaker 3>make a fraction of what woodley mix</v>
<v Speaker 3>likely so that those consequences have</v>

1388
01:04:24.991 --> 01:04:27.510
<v Speaker 3>to be taken into consideration when</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're watching these guys fight,</v>

1389
01:04:27.630 --> 01:04:30.420
<v Speaker 3>is that they know there's a wind bonus</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's a loss.</v>

1390
01:04:30.690 --> 01:04:32.910
<v Speaker 3>Like if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you lose,</v>

1391
01:04:32.911 --> 01:04:35.220
<v Speaker 3>you get your show money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't get a bonus,</v>

1392
01:04:35.490 --> 01:04:37.410
<v Speaker 3>but if you win,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get twice the money.</v>

1393
01:04:37.770 --> 01:04:40.170
<v Speaker 3>Like a lot of guys have that way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their contract is structured,</v>

1394
01:04:40.380 --> 01:04:42.630
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll make x if they win and they'll</v>

1395
01:04:42.631 --> 01:04:46.470
<v Speaker 3>make x plus x if they'll make x plus x</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they win.</v>

1396
01:04:46.471 --> 01:04:47.820
<v Speaker 3>But if they lose,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they only make x.</v>

1397
01:04:47.850 --> 01:04:50.610
<v Speaker 3>So they might have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they might be getting $200,000 for the</v>

1398
01:04:50.611 --> 01:04:52.680
<v Speaker 3>flight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but another $200,000 if they win,</v>

1399
01:04:52.800 --> 01:04:55.290
<v Speaker 3>that's a giant swing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a big deal.</v>

1400
01:04:55.291 --> 01:04:56.940
<v Speaker 3>So they have to be really fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>careful.</v>

1401
01:04:56.941 --> 01:05:00.210
<v Speaker 3>They don't make mistakes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't like when bonuses,</v>

1402
01:05:00.211 --> 01:05:01.830
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't like it.</v>

1403
01:05:02.280 --> 01:05:03.990
<v Speaker 3>I think those guys are trying to win</v>
<v Speaker 3>anyway.</v>

1404
01:05:04.020 --> 01:05:05.130
<v Speaker 3>They're trying to win.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

1405
01:05:05.131 --> 01:05:07.920
<v Speaker 3>I just think like especially in</v>
<v Speaker 3>particular in situations like that,</v>

1406
01:05:07.921 --> 01:05:10.080
<v Speaker 3>when fights are like that fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>clothes,</v>

1407
01:05:10.140 --> 01:05:13.890
<v Speaker 3>like a judge can decide whether or not</v>
<v Speaker 3>you make an extra 200 grand or don't</v>

1408
01:05:14.400 --> 01:05:17.710
<v Speaker 3>like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That seems crazy to me to do training</v>

1409
01:05:19.450 --> 01:05:21.550
<v Speaker 6>boxing a few a few weeks ago.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

1410
01:05:22.210 --> 01:05:23.940
<v Speaker 6>Back doing Jujitsu again too.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1411
01:05:24.080 --> 01:05:24.913
<v Speaker 6>That's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1412
01:05:24.920 --> 01:05:26.560
<v Speaker 6>that's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was,</v>

1413
01:05:26.580 --> 01:05:31.180
<v Speaker 6>but I wasn't walking back last night at</v>
<v Speaker 6>the crane academy.</v>

1414
01:05:31.270 --> 01:05:32.970
<v Speaker 6>I was night.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I came back from Ventura,</v>

1415
01:05:32.980 --> 01:05:36.000
<v Speaker 6>was teaching a workshop and I need some</v>
<v Speaker 6>let go something.</v>

1416
01:05:36.010 --> 01:05:39.540
<v Speaker 6>I didn't want to lift weights.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The dojo empty.</v>

1417
01:05:39.730 --> 01:05:41.170
<v Speaker 6>Why every bags,</v>
<v Speaker 6>gloves,</v>

1418
01:05:41.171 --> 01:05:42.160
<v Speaker 6>et cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Let's go.</v>

1419
01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:43.910
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's cool as well.</v>

1420
01:05:43.930 --> 01:05:47.200
<v Speaker 6>Heavy bag I think is everybody would do</v>
<v Speaker 6>better if they had a heavy bag in the</v>

1421
01:05:47.201 --> 01:05:49.660
<v Speaker 6>garage.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Just go out there and hit that thing.</v>

1422
01:05:49.930 --> 01:05:52.100
<v Speaker 6>It feels good.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You don't even have to have great form.</v>

1423
01:05:52.110 --> 01:05:55.630
<v Speaker 6>Just go out there and hit it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's so good for your body to just</v>

1424
01:05:55.631 --> 01:05:58.450
<v Speaker 6>explode and just release tension and</v>
<v Speaker 6>stress.</v>

1425
01:05:58.910 --> 01:06:02.230
<v Speaker 6>And for people of like joint issues,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they have these water bags.</v>

1426
01:06:02.910 --> 01:06:07.840
<v Speaker 6>It's essentially a thick layer of um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the outside is like a thick layer of</v>

1427
01:06:07.841 --> 01:06:10.690
<v Speaker 6>padding,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like a few inches of pad of foam.</v>

1428
01:06:10.810 --> 01:06:12.850
<v Speaker 6>And then inside of that as a water</v>
<v Speaker 6>bladder,</v>

1429
01:06:12.851 --> 01:06:15.780
<v Speaker 6>it's filled with water.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So when you punch like your boss,</v>

1430
01:06:15.820 --> 01:06:18.790
<v Speaker 6>your arm goes into it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but you could really dig in and hit it</v>

1431
01:06:18.791 --> 01:06:21.370
<v Speaker 6>hard,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it doesn't have the same impact on</v>

1432
01:06:21.371 --> 01:06:23.860
<v Speaker 6>your joints.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You don't feel it so much in your elbows</v>

1433
01:06:23.861 --> 01:06:28.770
<v Speaker 6>and your shoulders and stuff because it</v>
<v Speaker 6>was given to a creativity once in</v>

1434
01:06:28.780 --> 01:06:29.650
<v Speaker 6>Sicily,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1435
01:06:29.800 --> 01:06:32.980
<v Speaker 6>ever been easily.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That was the first time last year I went</v>

1436
01:06:32.981 --> 01:06:33.600
<v Speaker 6>to Italy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Cool.</v>

1437
01:06:33.600 --> 01:06:34.590
<v Speaker 6>Loved it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're like,</v>

1438
01:06:34.840 --> 01:06:36.310
<v Speaker 6>oh man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I went to Rome,</v>

1439
01:06:36.640 --> 01:06:38.500
<v Speaker 6>went to the Vatican,</v>
<v Speaker 6>saw the Vatican.</v>

1440
01:06:38.501 --> 01:06:39.740
<v Speaker 6>We went to,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

<v Speaker 6>Donate Dolomite?</v>

1442

<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>goddammit.</v>

1443

<v Speaker 6>Alpine.</v>

<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

1445

<v Speaker 6>Vesuvius.</v>

1446
01:06:52.710 --> 01:06:53.411
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

1447

<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we went there and then we went to uh,</v>

1448

<v Speaker 6>the Mafia.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Amalfi coast.</v>

1449
01:06:59.280 --> 01:07:00.810
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Beautiful.</v>

1450
01:07:00.850 --> 01:07:01.750
<v Speaker 6>Oh Man.</v>

1451

<v Speaker 6>Amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So beautiful.</v>

1452
01:07:02.711 --> 01:07:04.420
<v Speaker 6>Didn't even seem real.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It seems like you were in front of a</v>

1453
01:07:04.421 --> 01:07:06.520
<v Speaker 6>green screen.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You look out,</v>

<v Speaker 6>roads.</v>

<v Speaker 6>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Joey.</v>

1456
01:07:09.880 --> 01:07:12.370
<v Speaker 6>It's a road that should be one lane.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Should we one lane,</v>

1457
01:07:12.400 --> 01:07:14.170
<v Speaker 6>but it's too.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And there's pluses on it.</v>

1458

<v Speaker 6>Assholes and motorcycle</v>

<v Speaker 6>never seen.</v>

<v Speaker 6>I'm mostly Italian.</v>

1462
01:07:27.670 --> 01:07:30.770
<v Speaker 6>And you're going to have the left hand</v>
<v Speaker 6>steering wheel.</v>

1463
01:07:31.210 --> 01:07:32.800
<v Speaker 6>It's regular.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like regular.</v>

<v Speaker 6>here.</v>

1467

<v Speaker 6>Will Australia as well?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Australia.</v>

1468
01:07:42.600 --> 01:07:44.590
<v Speaker 6>It's fucking confusing as shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're like,</v>

1469
01:07:44.591 --> 01:07:48.330
<v Speaker 6>where am I going on the wrong side.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you have a.</v>

1470
01:07:48.350 --> 01:07:49.230
<v Speaker 6>If you didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 6>never,</v>

1471
01:07:49.420 --> 01:07:51.130
<v Speaker 6>never to driving.</v>

1472
01:07:52.300 --> 01:07:53.650
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Because you have the shift with your</v>

1473
01:07:53.651 --> 01:07:55.360
<v Speaker 6>left hand is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah,</v>

1474
01:07:55.361 --> 01:07:57.220

<v Speaker 6>you still love the clutch is still on</v>

1475
01:07:57.221 --> 01:07:58.120
<v Speaker 6>the lefthand side,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

1476
01:07:58.121 --> 01:08:01.030
<v Speaker 6>And the pedal steel in the right to</v>
<v Speaker 6>adjust.</v>

1477
01:08:01.150 --> 01:08:03.080
<v Speaker 6>But it would be the opposite version.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1478
01:08:03.100 --> 01:08:04.720
<v Speaker 6>So this is the what it's like on the</v>
<v Speaker 6>mouth of coast.</v>

1479
01:08:04.990 --> 01:08:07.420
<v Speaker 6>So you're driving on this road.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is what it's like.</v>

1480
01:08:07.450 --> 01:08:10.470
<v Speaker 6>That's a two lane road jelly.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's a fucking bus coming and you've</v>

1481
01:08:10.471 --> 01:08:12.430
<v Speaker 6>got to figure out how to get a car pass</v>
<v Speaker 6>that bus.</v>

1482
01:08:12.820 --> 01:08:15.010
<v Speaker 6>And we were going like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and I'm not exaggerating,</v>

1483
01:08:15.080 --> 01:08:16.580
<v Speaker 6>half of a mile an hour</v>

1484
01:08:16.730 --> 01:08:19.160
<v Speaker 2>trying to get past cars and buses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

1485
01:08:19.280 --> 01:08:21.800
<v Speaker 2>It takes forever to get up there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It should take 10 minutes.</v>

1486
01:08:21.920 --> 01:08:23.900
<v Speaker 2>That's the road.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It should take 10 minutes.</v>

1487
01:08:23.901 --> 01:08:28.901
<v Speaker 2>It takes 90,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but once you get up to the top,</v>

1488
01:08:28.920 --> 01:08:30.710
<v Speaker 2>look at that picture.</v>

<v Speaker 2>that's what it looks like when you.</v>

1492
01:08:35.780 --> 01:08:38.030
<v Speaker 2>Once you finally get updated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like wow,</v>

<v Speaker 2>it's so pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So pretty man.</v>

1494
01:08:40.990 --> 01:08:43.940
<v Speaker 2>Italy's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The foods and the foods grow out of this</v>

1495
01:08:44.090 --> 01:08:46.070
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

<v Speaker 2>You Bet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All your gluten free bullshit.</v>

1497
01:08:48.850 --> 01:08:50.270
<v Speaker 2>We've got to let that go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you're in.</v>

1498
01:08:50.860 --> 01:08:53.810
<v Speaker 2>A lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>people here say,</v>

1499
01:08:53.811 --> 01:08:55.730
<v Speaker 2>Nah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go at least nothing like that.</v>

1500
01:08:55.731 --> 01:08:59.030
<v Speaker 2>That's Americanized one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's more fish and stuff.</v>

1501
01:08:59.031 --> 01:08:59.990
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1502
01:08:59.991 --> 01:09:01.710
<v Speaker 2>they definitely did a lot of fish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do they use,</v>

1503
01:09:01.730 --> 01:09:02.960
<v Speaker 2>do they still use gravy?</v>

1504
01:09:02.960 --> 01:09:05.660
<v Speaker 2>Like red sauce?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not so much.</v>

1505
01:09:06.620 --> 01:09:08.870
<v Speaker 2>Not so much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could get it though and I think one</v>

1506
01:09:08.871 --> 01:09:11.030
<v Speaker 2>of the reasons why you can get it is</v>
<v Speaker 2>because probably people have come over</v>

1507
01:09:11.031 --> 01:09:12.440
<v Speaker 2>there and wanted it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1508
01:09:12.580 --> 01:09:13.970
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember that episode was a</v>
<v Speaker 2>prime.</v>

1509

1510
01:09:15.501 --> 01:09:18.200
<v Speaker 2>I want gravy and the one way to look at</v>
<v Speaker 2>the other one,</v>

1511
01:09:18.201 --> 01:09:20.060
<v Speaker 2>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's east coast.</v>

1512
01:09:20.061 --> 01:09:25.061
<v Speaker 2>The talent's there was classes with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Germans because he wanted spaghetti with</v>

1513
01:09:26.331 --> 01:09:27.620
<v Speaker 2>gravy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Big Old.</v>

1514
01:09:27.690 --> 01:09:29.570
<v Speaker 2>Would you say gravy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like people are like,</v>

1515
01:09:29.571 --> 01:09:32.170
<v Speaker 2>what is he talking great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like people think of like gray.</v>

1516
01:09:32.180 --> 01:09:33.720
<v Speaker 2>No kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1517
01:09:33.750 --> 01:09:35.530
<v Speaker 2>it was spaghetti sauce.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1519
01:09:39.800 --> 01:09:41.600

<v Speaker 2>You can get Bolognese over there,</v>

1520
01:09:41.601 --> 01:09:44.630
<v Speaker 2>but what it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just the Americans that came over,</v>

1521
01:09:44.660 --> 01:09:47.330
<v Speaker 2>they developed a different sort of style</v>
<v Speaker 2>of eating.</v>

1522
01:09:47.410 --> 01:09:48.680
<v Speaker 2>Like a lot of meatballs.</v>

1523
01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:53.880

1524
01:09:54.681 --> 01:09:57.110

01:13:32.131 --> 01:13:34.890
<v Speaker 2>get Linguini and clams and he would get</v>
<v Speaker 2>pissed if they didn't come home with a</v>

1601
01:13:34.891 --> 01:13:36.390
<v Speaker 2>cheese.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like where's the guy with the cheese?</v>

1602
01:13:36.610 --> 01:13:39.510
<v Speaker 2>I've got to have the grated cheese.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you would try to put it on like at a</v>

1603
01:13:39.511 --> 01:13:40.620
<v Speaker 2>good restaurant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would get.</v>

1604
01:13:40.680 --> 01:13:43.320
<v Speaker 2>They get upset with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want you putting that cheese on</v>

1605
01:13:43.321 --> 01:13:44.270

01:13:47.401 --> 01:13:50.190
<v Speaker 2>they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll ask you next cheese then that</v>

1608
01:13:50.191 --> 01:13:52.560

<v Speaker 2>But they don't even come near you.</v>

1609
01:13:52.880 --> 01:13:54.630
<v Speaker 2>They'll try to stay away from your side</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the table.</v>

1610
01:13:54.631 --> 01:13:57.090
<v Speaker 2>If you've got linguine with clams,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't want.</v>

1611
01:13:57.270 --> 01:13:59.100
<v Speaker 2>They don't want to give it to you and</v>
<v Speaker 2>even red wine,</v>

1612
01:13:59.130 --> 01:14:01.350

1616
01:14:06.030 --> 01:14:08.780
<v Speaker 2>I don't drink white wine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dry white wine.</v>

1617
01:14:08.840 --> 01:14:11.980

<v Speaker 2>I like red red.</v>

1622
01:14:21.490 --> 01:14:25.360
<v Speaker 2>To me it's like it's got a flavor that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>compelling.</v>

1623
01:14:25.361 --> 01:14:26.740
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

<v Speaker 5>whether we're the instep rather you</v>

1673
01:16:40.870 --> 01:16:44.130
<v Speaker 5>kicking with the top of the foot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everybody had this idea like that was</v>

1674
01:16:44.131 --> 01:16:46.970
<v Speaker 5>the way to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then the moment you get kicked with</v>

1680
01:16:59.970 --> 01:17:03.750
<v Speaker 5>discussed in the beginning of a Shin</v>
<v Speaker 5>kick change.</v>

1681
01:17:04.260 --> 01:17:05.520
<v Speaker 5>Then during the past,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1682
01:17:05.550 --> 01:17:08.370
<v Speaker 5>for,</v>

1683
01:17:08.371 --> 01:17:10.580
<v Speaker 5>style,</v>
<v Speaker 5>different and</v>

1684
01:17:10.730 --> 01:17:12.450
<v Speaker 4>defend.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The guy that changed my,</v>

1685
01:17:12.470 --> 01:17:15.800
<v Speaker 4>my way to see things transferred,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not to competition or to,</v>

1686
01:17:15.830 --> 01:17:18.620
<v Speaker 4>to to my line of duty was a guy in</v>
<v Speaker 4>Israel,</v>

1687
01:17:18.680 --> 01:17:22.610
<v Speaker 4>but it's because it's been into for war</v>
<v Speaker 4>three.</v>

1688
01:17:22.611 --> 01:17:24.830
<v Speaker 4>A man is like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>become like a second father for me.</v>

1689
01:17:24.870 --> 01:17:26.120
<v Speaker 4>And he always told me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1690
01:17:26.360 --> 01:17:29.170
<v Speaker 4>it's the spirit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't care the way that you punch,</v>

1691
01:17:29.171 --> 01:17:32.900
<v Speaker 4>the way you kicking in until your</v>
<v Speaker 4>mindset is not on point,</v>

1692
01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:37.010
<v Speaker 4>he's not going to be the not going to be</v>
<v Speaker 4>ready to do something for real.</v>

1693
01:17:37.030 --> 01:17:38.570
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's so that they can tell you,</v>

1694
01:17:38.780 --> 01:17:40.630
<v Speaker 4>do carotid,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do Jujitsu,</v>

1695
01:17:40.640 --> 01:17:42.320
<v Speaker 4>do they do that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if your mindset,</v>

1696
01:17:42.740 --> 01:17:44.320
<v Speaker 4>real things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you go to war,</v>

1697
01:17:44.330 --> 01:17:48.520
<v Speaker 4>you do you need to apply these fins for</v>
<v Speaker 4>change.</v>

1698
01:17:48.770 --> 01:17:51.920
<v Speaker 6>I think he's right,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but he's also not right because I think</v>

1699
01:17:52.040 --> 01:17:55.070
<v Speaker 6>he's right in the sense that your</v>
<v Speaker 6>mindset must be correct in order for you</v>

1700
01:17:55.071 --> 01:17:57.410
<v Speaker 6>to apply any,</v>
<v Speaker 6>any sort of martial arts in</v>

1701
01:17:57.450 --> 01:17:58.950
<v Speaker 6>international competition.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Absolutely,</v>

1702
01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.790
<v Speaker 6>but it's always important to have the</v>
<v Speaker 6>right technique.</v>

1703
01:18:02.210 --> 01:18:02.531
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Maybe I miss same.</v>

1706

<v Speaker 4>He never believed in.</v>

1707
01:18:08.910 --> 01:18:12.270
<v Speaker 4>Is there an Israeli guy he say</v>
<v Speaker 4>introduced the Jujitsu a lot,</v>

1709
01:18:16.510 --> 01:18:19.040
<v Speaker 4>we tie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you need to have the full aspect of</v>

1710
01:18:19.041 --> 01:18:22.790
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then of course if you go into the</v>

1711
01:18:23.120 --> 01:18:26.060
<v Speaker 4>Australian special forces there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the secret service and you need to have</v>

1712
01:18:26.420 --> 01:18:29.090
<v Speaker 4>the right guy to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some people are not ready to be a</v>

1713
01:18:29.091 --> 01:18:31.990
<v Speaker 4>warrior.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Can train like a warrior now warrior.</v>

1714
01:18:32.570 --> 01:18:34.040
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1715
01:18:34.041 --> 01:18:37.670
<v Speaker 6>I can only imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Especially like Krav Maga in the United</v>

1716
01:18:37.670 --> 01:18:40.430
<v Speaker 6>States,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's legit Krav Maga schools in the</v>

1717
01:18:40.430 --> 01:18:42.320
<v Speaker 6>United States for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's really good instruction is</v>

1718
01:18:42.321 --> 01:18:44.240
<v Speaker 6>really good,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but there's also a lot of fucking</v>

1719
01:18:44.360 --> 01:18:46.490
<v Speaker 6>horseshit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Just like with karate,</v>

1720
01:18:46.790 --> 01:18:50.420
<v Speaker 6>like there's a lot of mall karate where</v>
<v Speaker 6>you go to these places and they might be</v>

1721
01:18:50.421 --> 01:18:53.330
<v Speaker 6>fine for little kids.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're learning little martial arts,</v>

1722
01:18:53.331 --> 01:18:54.620
<v Speaker 6>learning,</v>
<v Speaker 6>little discipline,</v>

1723
01:18:54.760 --> 01:18:56.510
<v Speaker 6>they have goals,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1724
01:18:56.540 --> 01:18:59.540
<v Speaker 6>I want to get my orange belt and they</v>
<v Speaker 6>get it and they get excited and it's</v>

1725
01:18:59.541 --> 01:19:00.920
<v Speaker 6>good for them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's good for their mind,</v>

1726
01:19:01.460 --> 01:19:03.200
<v Speaker 6>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>

1727
01:19:03.250 --> 01:19:06.020
<v Speaker 6>it's really critical when you're</v>
<v Speaker 6>learning a martial art,</v>

1728
01:19:06.021 --> 01:19:08.840
<v Speaker 6>one of the most important thing is to</v>
<v Speaker 6>find a legitimate instructor.</v>

1729
01:19:09.230 --> 01:19:13.490
<v Speaker 6>It's the most important thing because</v>
<v Speaker 6>relearning things is so hard.</v>

1730
01:19:13.880 --> 01:19:16.490
<v Speaker 6>Back when I was teaching,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when I taught someone,</v>

1731
01:19:16.491 --> 01:19:18.620
<v Speaker 6>they didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If they didn't know anything,</v>

1732
01:19:18.650 --> 01:19:20.750
<v Speaker 6>they came to me with no martial arts</v>
<v Speaker 6>experience.</v>

1733
01:19:20.750 --> 01:19:24.170
<v Speaker 6>It was so much easier than if someone</v>
<v Speaker 6>came to me with bad martial arts</v>

1734
01:19:24.171 --> 01:19:28.280
<v Speaker 6>experience because if you have a.</v>
<v Speaker 6>like if he took karate for a few years</v>

1735
01:19:28.281 --> 01:19:31.040
<v Speaker 6>from some Bozo and you did everything</v>
<v Speaker 6>all wrong,</v>

1736
01:19:31.520 --> 01:19:34.310
<v Speaker 6>I would have to reteach you so when you</v>
<v Speaker 6>would panic,</v>

1737
01:19:34.311 --> 01:19:37.010
<v Speaker 6>if you would get nervous,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you would go right back to that old way.</v>

1738
01:19:37.280 --> 01:19:38.850
<v Speaker 6>Like as soon as someone puts the</v>
<v Speaker 6>pressure on you,</v>

1739
01:19:38.870 --> 01:19:40.820
<v Speaker 6>you would go right back to the old</v>
<v Speaker 6>shitty technique.</v>

1740
01:19:41.270 --> 01:19:46.270
<v Speaker 6>That's exactly what it's still about.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What is your learning and the movement</v>

1741
01:19:46.700 --> 01:19:50.870
<v Speaker 6>that is in your brain is the same</v>
<v Speaker 6>position or whatever you will achieve a</v>

1742
01:19:50.990 --> 01:19:53.780
<v Speaker 6>you put into the other way is wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're under stress.</v>

1743
01:19:53.781 --> 01:19:56.270
<v Speaker 6>Is gonna repeat the same face.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's where the everything man,</v>

1744
01:19:57.200 --> 01:19:59.960
<v Speaker 6>even for pool,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like there's certain techniques that</v>

1745
01:19:59.961 --> 01:20:02.540
<v Speaker 6>people learn where they don't learn how</v>
<v Speaker 6>to do pool correctly.</v>

1746
01:20:02.570 --> 01:20:05.930
<v Speaker 6>You only playing billiards,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you stand the wrong way and you get used</v>

1747
01:20:05.931 --> 01:20:08.760
<v Speaker 6>to it and when you're in a match and</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's a lot on the line,</v>

1748
01:20:08.761 --> 01:20:12.930
<v Speaker 6>you go right back to the old ways.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Even if you take lessons like it's so</v>

1749
01:20:13.050 --> 01:20:17.250
<v Speaker 6>important that when you learn things in</v>
<v Speaker 6>life to learn them right the first time.</v>

1750
01:20:17.251 --> 01:20:19.680
<v Speaker 6>That's why when you're growing up as a</v>
<v Speaker 6>human being,</v>

1751
01:20:19.980 --> 01:20:22.800
<v Speaker 6>I think it's been an issue with me.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think it's been an issue with you as</v>

1752
01:20:22.801 --> 01:20:24.120
<v Speaker 6>well.</v>
<v Speaker 6>When you.</v>

1753
01:20:24.150 --> 01:20:29.150
<v Speaker 6>Your childhood is kind of fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like you develop these ways of thinking</v>

1754
01:20:29.760 --> 01:20:34.350
<v Speaker 6>and acting as a child that are very</v>
<v Speaker 6>difficult to break as you get older and</v>

1755
01:20:34.351 --> 01:20:37.350
<v Speaker 6>you get as an adult,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's like you have this foundation</v>

1756
01:20:37.351 --> 01:20:40.500
<v Speaker 6>that's a very faulty and you have to be</v>
<v Speaker 6>cognizantly aware.</v>

1757
01:20:40.501 --> 01:20:42.930
<v Speaker 6>You have to be consciously aware of</v>
<v Speaker 6>that.</v>

1758
01:20:42.960 --> 01:20:45.060
<v Speaker 6>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this foundation is fucked up because I</v>

1759
01:20:45.061 --> 01:20:49.920
<v Speaker 6>grew up with domestic violence and I</v>
<v Speaker 6>grew up with no dad and so I have to</v>

1760
01:20:49.921 --> 01:20:54.390
<v Speaker 6>make sure that I don't fall into these</v>
<v Speaker 6>patterns that I had established in my</v>

1761
01:20:54.391 --> 01:20:56.700
<v Speaker 6>head when I was eight,</v>
<v Speaker 6>nine and 10 and 11.</v>

1762
01:20:56.710 --> 01:20:58.410
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>as you're growing up as a,</v>

1763
01:20:58.411 --> 01:21:00.660
<v Speaker 6>as an adult,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is the way you're looking at life</v>

1764
01:21:00.810 --> 01:21:02.370
<v Speaker 6>and then you have to kind of</v>
<v Speaker 6>restructure.</v>

1765
01:21:02.371 --> 01:21:04.200
<v Speaker 6>It almost sounds like you're starting</v>
<v Speaker 6>over,</v>

1766
01:21:04.530 --> 01:21:09.060
<v Speaker 6>but if you meet someone who has like a</v>
<v Speaker 6>great father and a great mother and they</v>

1767
01:21:09.061 --> 01:21:12.370
<v Speaker 6>grow up and they have like a great</v>
<v Speaker 6>fundamental balance by this.</v>

1768
01:21:12.420 --> 01:21:15.780
<v Speaker 6>Those people used to always make me</v>
<v Speaker 6>nervous when I was a kid because I was</v>

1769
01:21:15.781 --> 01:21:16.740
<v Speaker 6>always like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>God,</v>

1770
01:21:16.741 --> 01:21:19.200
<v Speaker 6>like these.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't even know anybody like that.</v>

1771
01:21:19.410 --> 01:21:20.720
<v Speaker 6>I got on.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't like,</v>

1772
01:21:21.210 --> 01:21:24.970
<v Speaker 6>I would feel like inferior to them,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like when I was around people that had a</v>

1773
01:21:24.990 --> 01:21:27.450
<v Speaker 6>good childhood,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I would feel inferior.</v>

1774
01:21:27.570 --> 01:21:30.000
<v Speaker 6>I still do.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You sure?</v>

1775
01:21:31.050 --> 01:21:34.650
<v Speaker 6>I feel.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I feel weird if I like I have,</v>

1776
01:21:34.710 --> 01:21:37.890
<v Speaker 6>I have friends that I think about them</v>
<v Speaker 6>now when I go,</v>

1777
01:21:37.891 --> 01:21:42.420
<v Speaker 6>I want to really interview their parents</v>
<v Speaker 6>like what did they do to get this kid to</v>

1778
01:21:42.421 --> 01:21:43.410
<v Speaker 6>be such a fucking?</v>

1779
01:21:44.160 --> 01:21:49.160
<v Speaker 6>What was the recipe to get this child to</v>
<v Speaker 6>be fucking superhuman being,</v>

1780
01:21:50.850 --> 01:21:52.940
<v Speaker 6>and I'm not talking about Julia</v>
<v Speaker 6>servings,</v>

1781
01:21:52.950 --> 01:21:57.950
<v Speaker 6>father or fucking gsps debt.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm talking about people who you meet in</v>

1782
01:21:58.081 --> 01:22:01.530
<v Speaker 6>life that I really fair,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that are really kind.</v>

1783
01:22:01.680 --> 01:22:06.450
<v Speaker 6>I look at those people and I go,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I wondered what their parents did with</v>

1784
01:22:06.451 --> 01:22:07.010
<v Speaker 6>that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Mike.</v>

1785
01:22:07.010 --> 01:22:12.010
<v Speaker 6>Good to have that ability to want to</v>
<v Speaker 6>help people and go out of that way.</v>

1786
01:22:12.420 --> 01:22:14.820
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I always think about that shit.</v>

1787
01:22:14.821 --> 01:22:17.370
<v Speaker 6>Especially now as a parent,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're like,</v>

1788
01:22:17.371 --> 01:22:21.630
<v Speaker 6>what is the fucking chemistry of love</v>
<v Speaker 6>for them to understand?</v>

1789
01:22:22.260 --> 01:22:24.960
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we were talking on the way up there when</v>

1790
01:22:24.961 --> 01:22:26.040
<v Speaker 6>my mother died,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1791
01:22:26.070 --> 01:22:30.720
<v Speaker 6>it was the seventies and let's face it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we were still specs and that New Jersey</v>

1792
01:22:30.721 --> 01:22:31.830
<v Speaker 6>neighborhood,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1793
01:22:31.831 --> 01:22:34.530
<v Speaker 6>in Boston and those areas,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you hear things,</v>

1794
01:22:34.920 --> 01:22:39.920
<v Speaker 6>but I remember those Italian kids coming</v>
<v Speaker 6>to my mom's wake and they couldn't make</v>

1795
01:22:40.111 --> 01:22:44.070
<v Speaker 6>eye contact with me.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The same ones that would say spic or</v>

1796
01:22:44.071 --> 01:22:49.071
<v Speaker 6>whatever because I short circuited that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I broke them because the number one</v>

1797
01:22:49.261 --> 01:22:50.550
<v Speaker 6>word,</v>
<v Speaker 6>admittedly his mama,</v>

1798
01:22:50.910 --> 01:22:52.860
<v Speaker 6>right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's it.</v>

1799
01:22:53.340 --> 01:22:55.050
<v Speaker 6>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>When you're in town and everything,</v>

1800
01:22:55.051 --> 01:22:57.870
<v Speaker 6>his Mama,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they would come to that wake and I would</v>

1801
01:22:57.871 --> 01:23:02.450
<v Speaker 6>short circuit them because they never</v>
<v Speaker 6>could think of that situation that</v>

1802
01:23:02.451 --> 01:23:05.980
<v Speaker 6>happened to them and I'm still friends</v>
<v Speaker 6>with those people today</v>

1803
01:23:06.490 --> 01:23:09.070
<v Speaker 2>and I always wondered why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1804
01:23:09.071 --> 01:23:13.990
<v Speaker 2>who raised him that that super great</v>
<v Speaker 2>people and then you come here to a place</v>

1805
01:23:13.991 --> 01:23:18.991
<v Speaker 2>like California and you meet people and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have nice parents or whatever,</v>

1806
01:23:19.430 --> 01:23:21.610
<v Speaker 2>potentially the biggest scumbags in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking world.</v>

1807
01:23:22.780 --> 01:23:25.330
<v Speaker 2>Do you follow them?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what interest me in my life.</v>

1808
01:23:25.360 --> 01:23:27.760
<v Speaker 2>I always feel like those people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the parents probably weren't around that</v>

1809
01:23:27.761 --> 01:23:30.460
<v Speaker 2>much or I might be really nice people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they didn't,</v>

1810
01:23:30.461 --> 01:23:35.461
<v Speaker 2>they weren't around to really install</v>
<v Speaker 2>the right ideals and values and morals</v>

1811
01:23:37.811 --> 01:23:39.220
<v Speaker 2>in their system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1812
01:23:39.221 --> 01:23:43.450
<v Speaker 2>maybe the parents were off at fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>swinger parties or some shit.</v>

1813
01:23:43.520 --> 01:23:44.840
<v Speaker 2>I always look at that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1814
01:23:44.890 --> 01:23:48.130
<v Speaker 2>with uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even the kids I grew up like I have a</v>

1815
01:23:48.131 --> 01:23:52.330
<v Speaker 2>friend that his dad was little but his</v>
<v Speaker 2>mother was solid.</v>

1816
01:23:52.870 --> 01:23:55.480
<v Speaker 2>And when you say his dad was a little,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you mean gang?</v>

1817
01:23:55.700 --> 01:23:57.370
<v Speaker 2>I'll put a bullet in your fucking eye</v>
<v Speaker 2>ball.</v>

1818
01:23:57.570 --> 01:23:59.200
<v Speaker 2>I'll put a bullet in your eyeball at</v>
<v Speaker 2>lunch,</v>

1819
01:23:59.720 --> 01:24:01.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1820
01:24:01.510 --> 01:24:04.090
<v Speaker 2>when I would hang out with them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people's parents would come to me and</v>

1821
01:24:04.091 --> 01:24:06.790
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't be going over there if I was.</v>

1822
01:24:06.791 --> 01:24:09.430
<v Speaker 2>You really see the article on his dad?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1823
01:24:09.470 --> 01:24:10.303
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a psycho.</v>

1824
01:24:10.450 --> 01:24:10.751
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1825
01:24:10.751 --> 01:24:12.090
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was a crazy.</v>

1826
01:24:12.370 --> 01:24:13.890
<v Speaker 2>We're just a street guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1827
01:24:14.050 --> 01:24:17.540
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>today the kid is one of my best friends.</v>

1828
01:24:17.560 --> 01:24:20.310
<v Speaker 2>Never had a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>never had a law problem.</v>

1829
01:24:20.380 --> 01:24:21.760
<v Speaker 2>Never.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No record,</v>

1830
01:24:21.770 --> 01:24:24.370
<v Speaker 2>never check it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Married children.</v>

1831
01:24:24.580 --> 01:24:25.001
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1832
01:24:25.001 --> 01:24:27.880
<v Speaker 2>there's people that grow up with</v>
<v Speaker 2>horrible environments and they come out</v>

1833
01:24:27.881 --> 01:24:30.130
<v Speaker 2>amazing and then their brothers and</v>
<v Speaker 2>sisters are all in jail.</v>

1834
01:24:30.310 --> 01:24:35.310
<v Speaker 2>It's weird how a person makes choices in</v>
<v Speaker 2>their life that really establishes their</v>

1835
01:24:35.831 --> 01:24:38.800
<v Speaker 2>entire life and a lot of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those choices,</v>

1836
01:24:39.340 --> 01:24:40.121
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hate to say it,</v>

1837
01:24:40.121 --> 01:24:40.960
<v Speaker 2>but it could be luck.</v>

1838
01:24:41.290 --> 01:24:45.760
<v Speaker 2>They could've made a lucky choice early</v>
<v Speaker 2>on and that lucky choice led them down a</v>

1839
01:24:45.761 --> 01:24:48.910
<v Speaker 2>better road than someone who's made,</v>
<v Speaker 2>made a poor choice.</v>

1840
01:24:49.120 --> 01:24:52.570
<v Speaker 2>Like kids that get involved in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>juvenile detention system when they're</v>

1841
01:24:52.571 --> 01:24:55.900
<v Speaker 2>really young boy that fucks them up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So was a horrible,</v>

1842
01:24:57.910 --> 01:25:02.010
<v Speaker 2>horrible and a good friends can know</v>
<v Speaker 2>good people are on juveniles and again</v>

1843
01:25:02.110 --> 01:25:03.790
<v Speaker 2>continued the right things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1844
01:25:03.820 --> 01:25:08.350
<v Speaker 2>even even if it's hard when he's telling</v>
<v Speaker 2>you the truth and the of sounds like a</v>

1845
01:25:08.360 --> 01:25:10.990
<v Speaker 2>smack be on their ads,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but make you open your eyes.</v>

1846
01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:11.920
<v Speaker 2>Make you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

1847
01:25:12.710 --> 01:25:15.160
<v Speaker 2>A kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once you put a kid in one of those</v>

1848
01:25:15.161 --> 01:25:18.270
<v Speaker 2>gladiator,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a prisons,</v>

1849
01:25:18.420 --> 01:25:20.260
<v Speaker 2>the percentages,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like we were just talking about</v>

1850
01:25:20.261 --> 01:25:23.560
<v Speaker 2>that movie that came out of sleepers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all four of them went away.</v>

1851
01:25:24.130 --> 01:25:28.380
<v Speaker 2>Two of them came out to become westies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other two came out to be decent.</v>

1852
01:25:28.390 --> 01:25:31.000
<v Speaker 2>The percentages,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's 50 fucking percent.</v>

1853
01:25:31.140 --> 01:25:31.973
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's,</v>

1854
01:25:31.980 --> 01:25:34.780
<v Speaker 2>that's on the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's on the conservative side,</v>

1855
01:25:35.050 --> 01:25:39.820
<v Speaker 2>right into the higher you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once you get that first tattoo and smoke</v>

1856
01:25:39.821 --> 01:25:41.830
<v Speaker 2>that first cigarette,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all those things,</v>

1857
01:25:42.100 --> 01:25:44.420
<v Speaker 2>your percentages go deeper and deeper.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1858
01:25:44.680 --> 01:25:47.910
<v Speaker 2>once you get the tattoo knuckles that</v>
<v Speaker 2>say fuck good,</v>

1859
01:25:49.840 --> 01:25:54.160
<v Speaker 2>Mike Tyson got the face tattoo at 40.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything had already all the bad stuff</v>

1860
01:25:54.161 --> 01:25:56.230
<v Speaker 2>out of his life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had already come through,</v>

1861
01:25:56.550 --> 01:25:59.350
<v Speaker 2>but it might Tyson with a cane with that</v>
<v Speaker 2>face tattoo at 18.</v>

1862
01:25:59.351 --> 01:26:01.030
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so weird.</v>

1863
01:26:01.031 --> 01:26:04.160
<v Speaker 2>Like how I saw it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw people on the bottom</v>

1864
01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:06.890
<v Speaker 6>that today,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that successful in the police records</v>

1865
01:26:06.891 --> 01:26:08.750
<v Speaker 6>don't matter,</v>
<v Speaker 6>nothing matters.</v>

1866
01:26:09.120 --> 01:26:11.390
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then I saw other people who were</v>

1867
01:26:11.391 --> 01:26:14.990
<v Speaker 6>like sneaky people who now they're in</v>
<v Speaker 6>trouble for tax evasion.</v>

1868
01:26:15.790 --> 01:26:17.660
<v Speaker 6>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like there's always.</v>

1869
01:26:19.640 --> 01:26:21.710
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>my mother was a big things for me.</v>

1870
01:26:21.800 --> 01:26:22.640
<v Speaker 6>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Mama,</v>

1871
01:26:22.820 --> 01:26:24.770
<v Speaker 6>my mind had been burned.</v>
<v Speaker 6>My mother,</v>

1872
01:26:24.780 --> 01:26:27.100
<v Speaker 6>she always told me to give it more that</v>
<v Speaker 6>you can do,</v>

1873
01:26:27.130 --> 01:26:30.530
<v Speaker 6>you want him to receive the Dapa.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then it was a bit told me,</v>

1874
01:26:30.531 --> 01:26:32.240
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like be,</v>

1875
01:26:32.241 --> 01:26:33.530
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>straight to people,</v>

1876
01:26:33.531 --> 01:26:34.101
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>don't,</v>

1877
01:26:34.101 --> 01:26:36.590
<v Speaker 6>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 6>don't fort around yourself so you're not</v>

1878
01:26:36.591 --> 01:26:39.280
<v Speaker 6>going to force it on people.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I believe that things,</v>

1879
01:26:39.330 --> 01:26:40.670
<v Speaker 6>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1880
01:26:41.270 --> 01:26:43.280
<v Speaker 6>It also helps if,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know people that work hard.</v>

1881
01:26:44.180 --> 01:26:45.130
<v Speaker 6>When I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

1882
01:26:45.260 --> 01:26:48.530
<v Speaker 6>my,</v>
<v Speaker 6>my best friends had jobs and they worked</v>

1883
01:26:48.531 --> 01:26:50.120
<v Speaker 6>hard.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They were constantly working.</v>

1884
01:26:50.300 --> 01:26:51.830
<v Speaker 6>There were always working at a young</v>
<v Speaker 6>age.</v>

1885
01:26:52.160 --> 01:26:53.950
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>My friend Jimmy and Jimmy Law,</v>

1886
01:26:53.990 --> 01:26:56.910
<v Speaker 6>I'm still buddies with them to this day,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but we were in high school.</v>

1887
01:26:57.420 --> 01:27:00.530
<v Speaker 6>I was fucking guys always worked in high</v>
<v Speaker 6>school and high school.</v>

1888
01:27:01.140 --> 01:27:03.650
<v Speaker 6>I always worked,</v>
<v Speaker 6>always worked at construction jobs,</v>

1889
01:27:03.651 --> 01:27:05.750
<v Speaker 6>always worked.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I had construction jobs too because my</v>

1890
01:27:05.751 --> 01:27:07.500
<v Speaker 6>dad was an architect.</v>
<v Speaker 6>My Stepdad,</v>

1891
01:27:07.520 --> 01:27:08.560
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1892
01:27:08.630 --> 01:27:12.380
<v Speaker 6>always set me up with these construction</v>
<v Speaker 6>crews and stuff.</v>

1893
01:27:12.381 --> 01:27:16.970
<v Speaker 6>So I did these jobs that we're in.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So it gave me the understanding that you</v>

1894
01:27:16.971 --> 01:27:19.460
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like if you've never worked hard and you</v>

1895
01:27:19.461 --> 01:27:22.430
<v Speaker 6>don't know what the fuck hard work is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>then all of a sudden you're 18 and then</v>

1896
01:27:22.431 --> 01:27:24.560
<v Speaker 6>you're in college and then you got out</v>
<v Speaker 6>of college,</v>

1897
01:27:24.561 --> 01:27:27.710
<v Speaker 6>then you have to get a job.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You have no real experience with actual</v>

1898
01:27:27.711 --> 01:27:31.430
<v Speaker 6>difficult work.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I just don't think you appreciate what</v>

1899
01:27:31.431 --> 01:27:36.431
<v Speaker 6>it takes to get by and growing up,</v>
<v Speaker 6>seeing people that had a strong work</v>

1900
01:27:38.241 --> 01:27:41.360
<v Speaker 6>ethic and realizing that that wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 6>something that I had,</v>

1901
01:27:41.570 --> 01:27:44.210
<v Speaker 6>but maybe it was something that I need</v>
<v Speaker 6>to consider as being like a very</v>

1902
01:27:44.211 --> 01:27:46.730
<v Speaker 6>important skill,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a very important trait.</v>

1903
01:27:47.720 --> 01:27:51.410
<v Speaker 6>The ability to just actually get shit</v>
<v Speaker 6>done to get up in the morning when your</v>

1904
01:27:51.411 --> 01:27:54.470
<v Speaker 6>alarm clock goes off and go,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're uncomfortable,</v>

1905
01:27:54.471 --> 01:27:56.090
<v Speaker 6>you want to stay in bed,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's cold out.</v>

1906
01:27:56.240 --> 01:27:57.710
<v Speaker 6>You don't want to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That,</v>

1907
01:27:57.730 --> 01:28:00.710
<v Speaker 6>that ability to just do it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>just get up and do it.</v>

1908
01:28:00.950 --> 01:28:03.350
<v Speaker 6>You know that old Nike slogan,</v>
<v Speaker 6>just do it.</v>

1909
01:28:03.730 --> 01:28:07.040
<v Speaker 6>It's one of the best fucking slogan of</v>
<v Speaker 6>all time.</v>

1910
01:28:07.180 --> 01:28:09.260
<v Speaker 6>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 6>People actually went out and worked out</v>

1911
01:28:09.261 --> 01:28:11.720
<v Speaker 6>just because that just do it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That might've been like the most</v>

1912
01:28:11.721 --> 01:28:15.650
<v Speaker 6>effective ad campaign in the history of</v>
<v Speaker 6>ad campaigns when it came to actually</v>

1913
01:28:15.651 --> 01:28:18.920
<v Speaker 6>getting people to do things that are</v>
<v Speaker 6>uncomfortable and something that</v>

1914
01:28:18.921 --> 01:28:23.921
<v Speaker 6>actually made sense.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Just do it so fucking so important.</v>

1915
01:28:24.170 --> 01:28:27.830
<v Speaker 6>It's so important.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Just gotTa fucking get things done and</v>

1916
01:28:27.831 --> 01:28:29.840
<v Speaker 6>for so many people,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like you were talking about the</v>

1917
01:28:29.841 --> 01:28:31.250
<v Speaker 6>beginning of the podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 6>show me that book,</v>

1918
01:28:31.251 --> 01:28:33.620
<v Speaker 6>the war of art where it talks about</v>
<v Speaker 6>resistance.</v>

1919
01:28:33.980 --> 01:28:36.830
<v Speaker 6>There's so many people that just fuck</v>
<v Speaker 6>off.</v>

1920
01:28:37.100 --> 01:28:40.340
<v Speaker 6>They fuck off and they don't get the</v>
<v Speaker 6>things done that need to get done and</v>

1921
01:28:40.341 --> 01:28:42.800
<v Speaker 6>that haunts them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We know it as comics.</v>

1922

<v Speaker 6>We know so many guys that told write new</v>
<v Speaker 6>material.</v>

1925
01:28:49.160 --> 01:28:51.440

<v Speaker 6>Because when you have new material man,</v>

1926

<v Speaker 6>sometimes it doesn't go well.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Sometimes you bomb.</v>

1927
01:28:54.350 --> 01:28:58.460
<v Speaker 6>Sometimes you go up and it's clunky.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's not ready and when you do a special</v>

<v Speaker 2>dead now and so now you have to write</v>
<v Speaker 2>all new material and you have a bunch of</v>

1931

<v Speaker 2>people that are coming to pay to see</v>

1933
01:29:10.230 --> 01:29:12.160
<v Speaker 2>always good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1934
01:29:12.330 --> 01:29:15.090
<v Speaker 2>I panicked every fucking week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every week when I go on the road I</v>

1935
01:29:15.091 --> 01:29:18.460
<v Speaker 2>panicked because I don't have a full 50</v>
<v Speaker 2>minutes of.</v>

1936
01:29:18.461 --> 01:29:20.970
<v Speaker 2>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got a couple fucking minutes and I'm</v>

1937
01:29:20.971 --> 01:29:23.400
<v Speaker 2>trying out new shit constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Constantly.</v>

1938
01:29:23.580 --> 01:29:26.250
<v Speaker 2>But can it comes together slowly but</v>
<v Speaker 2>surely together,</v>

1939
01:29:26.760 --> 01:29:28.860
<v Speaker 2>but it's just like anything else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's sticking with it.</v>

1940
01:29:28.861 --> 01:29:32.280
<v Speaker 2>Right now I'm in a slump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what do you do as a baseball player?</v>

1941
01:29:32.520 --> 01:29:33.750
<v Speaker 2>Jamie?</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you're in a slump,</v>

1942
01:29:33.751 --> 01:29:35.700
<v Speaker 2>what do you do as a baseball player?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You quit.</v>

1943
01:29:35.940 --> 01:29:38.550
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you keep fucking hitting and you keep</v>

1944
01:29:38.551 --> 01:29:41.190
<v Speaker 2>striking out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You keep fucking striking out and you</v>

1945
01:29:41.191 --> 01:29:43.860
<v Speaker 2>keep it together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You cannot lose it.</v>

1946
01:29:43.890 --> 01:29:48.890
<v Speaker 2>I Eka Tony Perez,</v>
<v Speaker 2>1976 slash 75 against the Boston red</v>

1947
01:29:49.561 --> 01:29:50.160
<v Speaker 2>sox.</v>

1948
01:29:50.160 --> 01:29:50.651
<v Speaker 2>He went,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1949
01:29:50.651 --> 01:29:53.780
<v Speaker 2>for 17 in the series and then game</v>
<v Speaker 2>seven,</v>

1950
01:29:53.781 --> 01:29:57.000
<v Speaker 2>he hit the single that chains.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They won the world series really?</v>

1951
01:29:57.750 --> 01:30:00.000
<v Speaker 2>So he could have just said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to do it.</v>

1952
01:30:00.240 --> 01:30:01.860
<v Speaker 2>I know I'm going to comedian slump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1953
01:30:01.861 --> 01:30:05.100
<v Speaker 2>not anymore now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like in December and January it was</v>

1954
01:30:05.101 --> 01:30:08.220
<v Speaker 2>fucking heavy jack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you just got to work yourself</v>

1955
01:30:08.221 --> 01:30:10.740
<v Speaker 2>through it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no other way to get yourself</v>

1956
01:30:10.741 --> 01:30:11.390
<v Speaker 2>through it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>

1957
01:30:11.390 --> 01:30:12.830
<v Speaker 2>There's no other way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no other.</v>

1958
01:30:12.831 --> 01:30:15.150
<v Speaker 2>There's no other way you don't want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And for me,</v>

1959
01:30:15.151 --> 01:30:16.740
<v Speaker 2>I could lie to you and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1960
01:30:16.741 --> 01:30:19.050
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to get on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to stay home and write for the</v>

1961
01:30:19.051 --> 01:30:20.480
<v Speaker 2>next three months.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not good enough.</v>

1962
01:30:21.090 --> 01:30:22.530
<v Speaker 2>Wrong answer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jack.</v>

1963
01:30:22.560 --> 01:30:24.050
<v Speaker 2>That's not going to work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not going to know.</v>

1964
01:30:24.051 --> 01:30:27.480
<v Speaker 2>You've got to keep going to the well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like right now I have a problem.</v>

1965
01:30:27.560 --> 01:30:31.500
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>last year I have such a fear of being on</v>

1966
01:30:31.501 --> 01:30:34.440
<v Speaker 2>my back and Jujitsu that it really</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking made me.</v>

1967
01:30:34.740 --> 01:30:38.370
<v Speaker 2>I will not quit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will not quit because what happens if</v>

1968
01:30:38.371 --> 01:30:40.620
<v Speaker 2>I'm on with Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm with my family one day and I got</v>

1969
01:30:40.621 --> 01:30:42.570
<v Speaker 2>kicked in the stomach and I'm on my</v>
<v Speaker 2>back.</v>

1970
01:30:42.571 --> 01:30:45.360
<v Speaker 2>Am I going to panic so I cannot fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>quit.</v>

1971
01:30:45.361 --> 01:30:49.020
<v Speaker 2>So I kept going back to digital,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the weird thing was I was doing it</v>

1972
01:30:49.021 --> 01:30:52.800
<v Speaker 2>wrong even though I was putting in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>time I wasn't working on my breathing.</v>

1973
01:30:53.250 --> 01:30:57.630
<v Speaker 2>I thought that by me going three times a</v>
<v Speaker 2>week and doing what a fighter does,</v>

1974
01:30:57.990 --> 01:31:02.640
<v Speaker 2>stay in the and that fighting three</v>
<v Speaker 2>times a year that my breathing would</v>

1975
01:31:02.641 --> 01:31:04.800
<v Speaker 2>come together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It will come together.</v>

1976
01:31:04.801 --> 01:31:07.500
<v Speaker 2>But then little not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not good,</v>

1977
01:31:07.680 --> 01:31:09.270
<v Speaker 2>not good delivery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1978
01:31:09.271 --> 01:31:11.970
<v Speaker 2>you know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the time I put in for what I get</v>

1979
01:31:11.971 --> 01:31:13.620
<v Speaker 2>back wasn't rewarding enough.</v>

1980
01:31:14.220 --> 01:31:16.980
<v Speaker 2>Like I would think of going to a</v>
<v Speaker 2>different approach.</v>

1981
01:31:17.010 --> 01:31:18.810
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I started doing those little</v>

1982
01:31:18.811 --> 01:31:20.760
<v Speaker 2>things with Alberto when the back when I</v>
<v Speaker 2>get there,</v>

1983
01:31:20.761 --> 01:31:22.620
<v Speaker 2>the breathing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what man?</v>

1984
01:31:22.621 --> 01:31:24.840
<v Speaker 2>I'm a big boy now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to tell me Dick.</v>

1985
01:31:25.170 --> 01:31:29.070
<v Speaker 2>I know I got something wrong with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>back of my head with that fear Shit and</v>

1986
01:31:29.071 --> 01:31:31.830
<v Speaker 2>it with the needles and what did I do</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the needles?</v>

1987
01:31:31.831 --> 01:31:33.000
<v Speaker 2>Dope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could faint,</v>

1988
01:31:33.420 --> 01:31:35.640
<v Speaker 2>faint.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Walking into a doctor's office.</v>

1989
01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:39.150
<v Speaker 2>I could smell cotton.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't smell shit.</v>

1990
01:31:39.450 --> 01:31:43.620
<v Speaker 2>I could smell fucking cotton.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like walk into a doctor's office.</v>

1991
01:31:43.920 --> 01:31:46.740
<v Speaker 2>I could smell that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Associates with fear.</v>

1992
01:31:47.340 --> 01:31:49.440
<v Speaker 2>Tremendous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I walk into a doctor's office,</v>

1993
01:31:49.650 --> 01:31:52.330
<v Speaker 2>my blood pressure is 190 over one 60</v>
<v Speaker 2>dogs.</v>

1994
01:31:52.920 --> 01:31:55.380
<v Speaker 2>They look at me and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how were you walking?</v>

1995
01:31:55.381 --> 01:31:56.220
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take a hike,</v>

1996
01:31:56.580 --> 01:31:59.980
<v Speaker 2>come back in 10 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And once my doctor comes back and</v>

1997
01:31:59.980 --> 01:32:04.510
<v Speaker 3>he starts talking to me and we talk</v>
<v Speaker 3>about Chicago beef sandwiches,</v>

1998
01:32:05.170 --> 01:32:06.190
<v Speaker 3>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>watch this.</v>

1999
01:32:06.700 --> 01:32:08.710
<v Speaker 3>And it's 1:40 over 80.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I figured,</v>

2000
01:32:08.740 --> 01:32:09.570
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>

2001
01:32:09.570 --> 01:32:11.080
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I lived through this.</v>

2002
01:32:11.081 --> 01:32:11.940
<v Speaker 3>I lived through it.</v>

2003
01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.580
<v Speaker 4>It's a four.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's all about for me,</v>

2004
01:32:14.670 --> 01:32:15.650
<v Speaker 4>when a train people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2005
01:32:15.651 --> 01:32:16.650
<v Speaker 4>I tried to say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

2006
01:32:17.100 --> 01:32:20.220
<v Speaker 4>you're doing tempo shop and if you come</v>
<v Speaker 4>to the eight,</v>

2007
01:32:20.520 --> 01:32:22.980
<v Speaker 4>the number eight and you'll see that you</v>
<v Speaker 4>start to struggle.</v>

2008
01:32:23.030 --> 01:32:27.330
<v Speaker 4>Does that stop?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't allow you to do a bad number,</v>

2009
01:32:27.480 --> 01:32:30.230
<v Speaker 4>a number nine because I know number nine</v>
<v Speaker 4>is going to be a bad push up.</v>

2010
01:32:30.620 --> 01:32:31.453
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But for them.</v>

2011
01:32:31.650 --> 01:32:34.230
<v Speaker 4>So what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you got to be under stress,</v>

2012
01:32:34.260 --> 01:32:36.480
<v Speaker 4>you're going to be repeating the best</v>
<v Speaker 4>for them.</v>

2013
01:32:36.500 --> 01:32:39.510
<v Speaker 4>So for me it's the constantly I try to</v>
<v Speaker 4>remap you,</v>

2014
01:32:39.511 --> 01:32:40.920
<v Speaker 4>like you said before,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you were teaching,</v>

2015
01:32:40.980 --> 01:32:44.430
<v Speaker 4>remapping the way that you always try to</v>
<v Speaker 4>achieve the best.</v>

2016
01:32:44.490 --> 01:32:45.600
<v Speaker 4>So like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just do it.</v>

2017
01:32:45.630 --> 01:32:46.500
<v Speaker 4>What I say.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2018
01:32:46.501 --> 01:32:49.290
<v Speaker 4>You need to repeat the things and to you</v>
<v Speaker 4>never do it wrong.</v>

2019
01:32:49.420 --> 01:32:50.940
<v Speaker 4>Don't do it right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You'll never do wrong.</v>

2020
01:32:51.410 --> 01:32:53.980
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Once you can come from blackness is a</v>

2021
01:32:53.990 --> 01:32:57.000
<v Speaker 4>like shot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want you to learn how to do it right</v>

2022
01:32:57.120 --> 01:33:00.600
<v Speaker 4>every single time and that's when we can</v>
<v Speaker 4>step forward to the next level.</v>

2023
01:33:00.620 --> 01:33:03.260
<v Speaker 3>Do you subscribe to that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pavel Salini,</v>

2024
01:33:03.380 --> 01:33:08.030
<v Speaker 3>you know he's got that strong first.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Allow the ideology where you don't do,</v>

2025
01:33:08.090 --> 01:33:11.000
<v Speaker 3>you don't do the failure ever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I do that now.</v>

2026
01:33:11.120 --> 01:33:12.770
<v Speaker 3>So that's how I do all my work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

2027
01:33:12.771 --> 01:33:15.830
<v Speaker 3>I don't lift to failure ever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like say if I could do 10 reps or</v>

2028
01:33:15.831 --> 01:33:18.260
<v Speaker 3>something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do five and then I wait like 10</v>

2029
01:33:18.261 --> 01:33:20.330
<v Speaker 3>minutes and not do another five.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then I'll wait 10 minutes,</v>

2030
01:33:20.331 --> 01:33:21.920
<v Speaker 3>I'll do another five.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't like 10 minutes.</v>

2031
01:33:21.921 --> 01:33:24.800
<v Speaker 3>I'll do another five.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the idea being that it's more</v>

2032
01:33:24.801 --> 01:33:29.801
<v Speaker 3>important to do more workouts in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>week with low repetition than it is to</v>

2033
01:33:29.901 --> 01:33:34.130
<v Speaker 3>do a high repetition workout.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you know where the guy's like,</v>

2034
01:33:34.131 --> 01:33:35.710
<v Speaker 3>come on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>spot me last one.</v>

2035
01:33:37.460 --> 01:33:39.860
<v Speaker 3>That's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your body's not designed to do that.</v>

2036
01:33:39.861 --> 01:33:42.560
<v Speaker 3>Your body's not designed to be at</v>
<v Speaker 3>failure ever.</v>

2037
01:33:42.680 --> 01:33:45.530
<v Speaker 3>So what you're supposed to do is build</v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself up.</v>

2038
01:33:45.890 --> 01:33:49.850
<v Speaker 3>So you're doing these exercises and he</v>
<v Speaker 3>says that you should think of them as a</v>

2039
01:33:49.851 --> 01:33:51.980
<v Speaker 3>skill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That strength strengthens a skill.</v>

2040
01:33:52.220 --> 01:33:54.590
<v Speaker 3>So each exercise you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't want to be tired when you're</v>

2041
01:33:54.591 --> 01:33:56.390
<v Speaker 3>doing a skill,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't want to be completely</v>

2042
01:33:56.391 --> 01:34:00.380
<v Speaker 3>exhausted when you're trying to pull</v>
<v Speaker 3>back a bow and Arrow or shoot a pool</v>

2043
01:34:00.381 --> 01:34:03.830
<v Speaker 3>game or shoot a ball and pool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What you want to do is you want to have</v>

2044
01:34:03.831 --> 01:34:07.430
<v Speaker 3>that cemented in your mind when he calls</v>
<v Speaker 3>greasing the groove,</v>

2045
01:34:07.760 --> 01:34:09.700
<v Speaker 3>like each time you do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd do it perfect.</v>

2046
01:34:09.720 --> 01:34:13.730
<v Speaker 3>You do it with perfect form and you just</v>
<v Speaker 3>do low repetitions with heavyweights.</v>

2047
01:34:13.840 --> 01:34:16.600
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know Pablo and trump first.</v>

2048
01:34:16.660 --> 01:34:18.030
<v Speaker 4>But if it's another amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's cool.</v>

2049
01:34:18.250 --> 01:34:20.620
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And one of my coach of strength</v>

2050
01:34:20.621 --> 01:34:22.100
<v Speaker 4>conditioning.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2051
01:34:22.810 --> 01:34:24.580
<v Speaker 4>And yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what I do for myself.</v>

2052
01:34:24.581 --> 01:34:26.590
<v Speaker 4>He didn't even because of those flights,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2053
01:34:26.620 --> 01:34:28.380
<v Speaker 4>my jet lag,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my cns machine,</v>

2054
01:34:28.381 --> 01:34:31.840
<v Speaker 4>none of the assistant medical already</v>
<v Speaker 4>what I do when I train,</v>

2055
01:34:31.900 --> 01:34:35.660
<v Speaker 4>I never,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd maybe I'll every four week I tried</v>

2056
01:34:35.661 --> 01:34:39.610
<v Speaker 4>to do one or two reps and 95 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I never tried to do a personal record.</v>

2057
01:34:39.850 --> 01:34:43.390
<v Speaker 4>I always liked to work like 85 percent</v>
<v Speaker 4>few reps show.</v>

2058
01:34:43.391 --> 01:34:47.300
<v Speaker 4>Even psychologically I know that I can</v>
<v Speaker 4>enter the good form at that level and</v>

2059
01:34:47.360 --> 01:34:48.270
<v Speaker 4>never got out</v>

2060
01:34:49.480 --> 01:34:53.650
<v Speaker 3>for people who are interested in this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go go to a pavle has a lot of stuff</v>

2061
01:34:53.651 --> 01:34:55.180
<v Speaker 3>online,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think some of the best stuff</v>

2062
01:34:55.181 --> 01:34:57.320
<v Speaker 3>online is him on the Tim Ferriss</v>
<v Speaker 3>podcast.</v>

2063
01:34:57.620 --> 01:34:57.980
<v Speaker 3>Really</v>

2064
01:34:57.980 --> 01:35:01.010
<v Speaker 6>excellent stuff and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he's got his own books out there and</v>

2065
01:35:01.011 --> 01:35:03.440
<v Speaker 6>he's got books on tape and he's got</v>
<v Speaker 6>videos and you could see a lot of his</v>

2066
01:35:03.441 --> 01:35:06.080
<v Speaker 6>videos,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but his method is so good.</v>

2067
01:35:06.140 --> 01:35:09.110
<v Speaker 6>It's so.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's so smart and it's made big</v>

2068
01:35:09.111 --> 01:35:10.220
<v Speaker 6>differences with me.</v>
<v Speaker 6>First of all,</v>

2069
01:35:10.221 --> 01:35:15.221
<v Speaker 6>it's cut my injuries down radically,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like radically because I would be doing</v>

2070
01:35:15.441 --> 01:35:15.980
<v Speaker 6>these,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2071
01:35:15.980 --> 01:35:18.770
<v Speaker 6>12,</v>
<v Speaker 6>15 repetitions with heavyweight and like</v>

2072
01:35:18.771 --> 01:35:23.771
<v Speaker 6>barely getting the 13th one and then the</v>
<v Speaker 6>14th and then you know,</v>

2073
01:35:24.121 --> 01:35:27.860
<v Speaker 6>your forum gets all fucking sloppy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Your back's bending in a weird way.</v>

2074
01:35:27.900 --> 01:35:29.420
<v Speaker 6>It's terrible for you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It would be terrible.</v>

2075
01:35:29.450 --> 01:35:30.970
<v Speaker 6>We've been totally that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Just,</v>

2076
01:35:31.210 --> 01:35:32.140
<v Speaker 6>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2077
01:35:32.270 --> 01:35:33.110
<v Speaker 6>no pain,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no gain.</v>

2078
01:35:33.111 --> 01:35:35.120
<v Speaker 6>That was shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

2079
01:35:35.121 --> 01:35:37.100
<v Speaker 6>that's not how you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's so dumb.</v>

2080
01:35:37.250 --> 01:35:41.270
<v Speaker 6>But now I'm lucky that I have weights at</v>
<v Speaker 6>home so I have kettle bells at home so I</v>

2081
01:35:41.271 --> 01:35:44.000
<v Speaker 6>can do it four days a week,</v>
<v Speaker 6>five days a week and I'll work out for</v>

2082
01:35:44.001 --> 01:35:44.750
<v Speaker 6>an hour.</v>

2083
01:35:44.750 --> 01:35:46.460
<v Speaker 6>I'll just go in there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's 8:00 in the morning.</v>

2084
01:35:46.461 --> 01:35:48.950
<v Speaker 6>I start lifting,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm done in an hour and I'm not even</v>

2085
01:35:48.951 --> 01:35:50.840
<v Speaker 6>exhausted.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Not only am I not exhausted,</v>

2086
01:35:50.841 --> 01:35:52.850
<v Speaker 6>I feel kind of pumped up and kind of</v>
<v Speaker 6>charged,</v>

2087
01:35:53.090 --> 01:35:54.260
<v Speaker 6>but I'm not like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

2088
01:35:54.500 --> 01:35:57.950
<v Speaker 6>like I used to work out sometimes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like back in the day I would do lifts</v>

2089
01:35:58.340 --> 01:36:00.200
<v Speaker 6>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>by the time the lift was over,</v>

2090
01:36:00.290 --> 01:36:01.850
<v Speaker 6>my fault,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was light headed,</v>

2091
01:36:02.150 --> 01:36:05.430
<v Speaker 6>my legs were shaking,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I could barely walk and you don't have</v>

2092
01:36:05.440 --> 01:36:08.120
<v Speaker 6>any energy left to do things and I've</v>
<v Speaker 6>try to go to Jujitsu.</v>

2093
01:36:08.540 --> 01:36:11.360
<v Speaker 6>Hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I would just get mauled,</v>

2094
01:36:11.690 --> 01:36:13.760
<v Speaker 6>just couldn't do it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2095
01:36:13.761 --> 01:36:15.830
<v Speaker 6>it'd be fucking wrecked for like two or</v>
<v Speaker 6>three days.</v>

2096
01:36:15.980 --> 01:36:19.640
<v Speaker 6>So I'd be really nervous to lift in the</v>
<v Speaker 6>morning and then do Jujitsu at night</v>

2097
01:36:19.641 --> 01:36:23.090
<v Speaker 6>because I would know that I was going to</v>
<v Speaker 6>be operating at like 50 percent or 60</v>

2098
01:36:23.091 --> 01:36:23.840
<v Speaker 6>percent.</v>

2099
01:36:23.840 --> 01:36:28.370
<v Speaker 6>I'll just get my ass kicked.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But if you do kettle bells with low</v>

2100
01:36:28.371 --> 01:36:30.200
<v Speaker 6>repetitions,</v>
<v Speaker 6>even with heavy weight,</v>

2101
01:36:30.260 --> 01:36:33.170
<v Speaker 6>you could do a real good workout.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then that night you could work</v>

2102
01:36:33.260 --> 01:36:36.110
<v Speaker 6>Jujitsu and you can be 100 percent close</v>
<v Speaker 6>to a bluff.</v>

2103
01:36:36.200 --> 01:36:40.460
<v Speaker 6>Pavel,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Pavel Tatsumi will tattoo you in touch</v>

2104
01:36:40.480 --> 01:36:44.210
<v Speaker 6>with Leni Habib.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He also wanted like,</v>

2105
01:36:44.211 --> 01:36:47.060
<v Speaker 6>he doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he wants you to finish the Kettlebell</v>

2106
01:36:47.061 --> 01:36:50.440
<v Speaker 6>workout energized.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He doesn't want you to finish it.</v>

2107
01:36:51.480 --> 01:36:53.710
<v Speaker 6>He doesn't want that at all.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I read that.</v>

2108
01:36:54.050 --> 01:36:55.910
<v Speaker 6>That's this whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>God wants you to finish.</v>

2109
01:36:55.911 --> 01:36:59.710
<v Speaker 6>They're ready to go take on the world.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I tell you I was,</v>

2110
01:36:59.780 --> 01:37:01.660
<v Speaker 6>I called Joe or they go joe,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you to go,</v>

2111
01:37:02.020 --> 01:37:05.990
<v Speaker 6>you gave me the kettle bells.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I love doing cleans.</v>

2112
01:37:05.991 --> 01:37:09.150
<v Speaker 6>I love doing the gun slings,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but you know,</v>

2113
01:37:09.470 --> 01:37:14.470
<v Speaker 6>I try to do 10 sets of 10,</v>
<v Speaker 6>12 swings and 10 minutes and I would do</v>

2114
01:37:15.531 --> 01:37:18.410
<v Speaker 6>that and I've achieved my goal and I'd</v>
<v Speaker 6>be very happy.</v>

2115
01:37:18.920 --> 01:37:20.630
<v Speaker 6>But then I couldn't go to Jujitsu for</v>
<v Speaker 6>three days.</v>

2116
01:37:20.770 --> 01:37:22.370
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So what the fuck did I do?</v>

2117
01:37:22.371 --> 01:37:24.900
<v Speaker 6>I'm 53,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2118
01:37:25.040 --> 01:37:26.120
<v Speaker 6>but I would go,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I did it,</v>

2119
01:37:26.150 --> 01:37:31.150
<v Speaker 6>that had five sets of cleans with two</v>
<v Speaker 6>fives and then a jump rope and then try</v>

2120
01:37:32.241 --> 01:37:35.390
<v Speaker 6>to do setups and then for three days of</v>
<v Speaker 6>dog shit,</v>

2121
01:37:36.170 --> 01:37:37.940
<v Speaker 6>dog shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I called him up and he goes,</v>

2122
01:37:38.110 --> 01:37:40.850
<v Speaker 6>go cut it in half.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then I said,</v>

2123
01:37:40.880 --> 01:37:43.190
<v Speaker 6>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm only going to do my weights now.</v>

2124
01:37:43.191 --> 01:37:47.300
<v Speaker 6>On the road when I go to a hotel now,</v>
<v Speaker 6>every two weeks I work every other week</v>

2125
01:37:47.690 --> 01:37:49.910
<v Speaker 6>I'll hit the dumbbells and do the</v>
<v Speaker 6>elliptical,</v>

2126
01:37:49.911 --> 01:37:53.190
<v Speaker 6>but when I'm in town I'll just do the</v>
<v Speaker 6>tactile,</v>

2127
01:37:53.300 --> 01:37:55.980
<v Speaker 6>the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a little it Jujitsu and then</v>

2128
01:37:55.980 --> 01:37:58.770
<v Speaker 5>I'd do attack with at the end.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you know what man,</v>

2129
01:37:58.771 --> 01:38:01.460
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to walk around hunched up</v>
<v Speaker 5>when I'm 60.</v>

2130
01:38:01.980 --> 01:38:04.920
<v Speaker 5>I got a four year old.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I got to be around and be.</v>

2131
01:38:05.340 --> 01:38:07.050
<v Speaker 5>I liked it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I could touch my toes,</v>

2132
01:38:07.051 --> 01:38:08.310
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I like all this stuff.</v>

2133
01:38:08.311 --> 01:38:12.810
<v Speaker 5>But one thing I noticed about tax fit</v>
<v Speaker 5>that there's a couple movies that they</v>

2134
01:38:12.811 --> 01:38:14.880
<v Speaker 5>put in there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if you did it or somebody</v>

2135
01:38:14.881 --> 01:38:17.190
<v Speaker 5>did that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that Jujitsu friendly.</v>

2136
01:38:17.590 --> 01:38:20.760
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like the moving movement to know if you</v>

2137
01:38:20.780 --> 01:38:24.960
<v Speaker 5>look at when you look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>even the kids rolling around when is a,</v>

2138
01:38:25.240 --> 01:38:27.440
<v Speaker 5>his early stage.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You go through something like,</v>

2139
01:38:27.450 --> 01:38:29.670
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>double as they can transfer machine box</v>

2140
01:38:29.671 --> 01:38:31.680
<v Speaker 5>or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can go into the rolling into the</v>

2141
01:38:31.681 --> 01:38:33.210
<v Speaker 5>garden.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So we got to talk to them like,</v>

2142
01:38:33.300 --> 01:38:34.133
<v Speaker 5>oh sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So sorry.</v>

2143
01:38:34.160 --> 01:38:39.160
<v Speaker 5>So again you can see moving his moment.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So what we would start to do it start to</v>

2144
01:38:41.041 --> 01:38:45.240
<v Speaker 5>analyze those moments and try to get a</v>
<v Speaker 5>mechanical information about those</v>

2145
01:38:45.241 --> 01:38:46.074
<v Speaker 5>moments.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2146
01:38:46.240 --> 01:38:49.590
<v Speaker 5>But the APP,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they apply very well on transition for</v>

2147
01:38:49.890 --> 01:38:52.910
<v Speaker 5>some Jujitsu and that's another things</v>
<v Speaker 5>that are bad.</v>

2148
01:38:52.911 --> 01:38:55.740
<v Speaker 5>There was no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was blowing his mind.</v>

2149
01:38:55.870 --> 01:39:00.390
<v Speaker 5>Say if I get the guys to move better,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's easier for me to pass the technique</v>

2150
01:39:00.391 --> 01:39:01.224
<v Speaker 5>because they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

2151
01:39:01.350 --> 01:39:03.690
<v Speaker 5>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they already know it.</v>

2152
01:39:03.770 --> 01:39:07.180
<v Speaker 3>One of the things that Eddie founders,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that guys who are break dancers,</v>

2153
01:39:07.280 --> 01:39:09.110
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>excelled in Jujitsu.</v>

2154
01:39:09.470 --> 01:39:11.480
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a kid who fought this past</v>

2155
01:39:11.480 --> 01:39:13.100
<v Speaker 3>weekend,</v>
<v Speaker 3>landover Nada in Orlando.</v>

2156
01:39:13.101 --> 01:39:15.290
<v Speaker 3>Vanana groovy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lando fought this past weekend.</v>

2157
01:39:15.440 --> 01:39:18.080
<v Speaker 3>He fought David Tamer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Crazy fight was a co main event.</v>

2158
01:39:18.800 --> 01:39:21.910
<v Speaker 3>Lando has only been striking for six</v>
<v Speaker 3>years and,</v>

2159
01:39:21.911 --> 01:39:24.950
<v Speaker 3>but he's phenomenal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what happened was he started with a</v>

2160
01:39:24.951 --> 01:39:28.460
<v Speaker 3>BMX background.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was a pro bmx racer and was like</v>

2161
01:39:28.520 --> 01:39:32.030
<v Speaker 3>apparently like a national champion and</v>
<v Speaker 3>bmx and that pumping,</v>

2162
01:39:32.300 --> 01:39:34.310
<v Speaker 3>pumping bike legs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2163
01:39:34.311 --> 01:39:38.270
<v Speaker 3>just be being able to like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like generate extreme speed off the</v>

2164
01:39:38.271 --> 01:39:40.700
<v Speaker 3>line.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He developed as explosive ability to use</v>

2165
01:39:40.701 --> 01:39:44.930
<v Speaker 3>his legs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so that like having cross training,</v>

2166
01:39:45.110 --> 01:39:48.800
<v Speaker 3>whether it's through tack fit or whether</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's through yoga or whether it's two</v>

2167
01:39:48.801 --> 01:39:51.530
<v Speaker 3>kettlebells or break dancing or anything</v>
<v Speaker 3>else.</v>

2168
01:39:51.770 --> 01:39:53.750
<v Speaker 3>Shaka for Aldo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

2169
01:39:53.780 --> 01:39:56.140
<v Speaker 3>Soccer for all those bridges,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sprinting,</v>

2170
01:39:56.470 --> 01:39:57.380
<v Speaker 3>sprinting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they do.</v>

2171
01:39:57.380 --> 01:40:01.550
<v Speaker 3>And all the kicking they do in soccer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The learning how to move your body.</v>

2172
01:40:01.730 --> 01:40:05.660
<v Speaker 3>Like look at what's going on with conor</v>
<v Speaker 3>mcgregor that ido parked out there.</v>

2173
01:40:05.780 --> 01:40:10.580
<v Speaker 3>He's concentrating so much on movement</v>
<v Speaker 3>and movement is just a huge factor in</v>

2174
01:40:10.581 --> 01:40:15.320
<v Speaker 3>his success because his ability to</v>
<v Speaker 3>dictate like where first of all its</v>

2175
01:40:15.321 --> 01:40:19.490
<v Speaker 3>ability to move in and out is better</v>
<v Speaker 3>than almost anybody's.</v>

2176
01:40:19.610 --> 01:40:23.480
<v Speaker 3>His ability to get out of the way and</v>
<v Speaker 3>his ability to move in close and move</v>

2177
01:40:23.481 --> 01:40:27.650
<v Speaker 3>like a fucking snake like is on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>outside and boom he's in and he's in</v>

2178
01:40:27.651 --> 01:40:28.910
<v Speaker 3>before you know it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And these,</v>

2179
01:40:28.911 --> 01:40:33.500
<v Speaker 3>these complicated sort of tricky moves</v>
<v Speaker 3>to try to time and follow.</v>

2180
01:40:33.920 --> 01:40:35.600
<v Speaker 3>Very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very difficult guy to time.</v>

2181
01:40:35.960 --> 01:40:40.610
<v Speaker 3>And a lot of that comes from constant</v>
<v Speaker 3>application of all this movement theory</v>

2182
01:40:40.611 --> 01:40:44.300
<v Speaker 3>and movement training.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And like the more you can move your body</v>

2183
01:40:44.301 --> 01:40:47.030
<v Speaker 3>any way you want,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the more you're going to be able to move</v>

2184
01:40:47.031 --> 01:40:48.740
<v Speaker 3>your body any way you want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And competition.</v>

2185
01:40:49.080 --> 01:40:50.910
<v Speaker 5>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>

2186
01:40:51.090 --> 01:40:54.110
<v Speaker 5>at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like you said at the beginning of this</v>

2187
01:40:54.110 --> 01:40:54.910
<v Speaker 5>a,</v>

2188
01:40:54.910 --> 01:40:57.850
<v Speaker 4>you can call it Tashi,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sfg Ido,</v>

2189
01:40:58.060 --> 01:41:01.360
<v Speaker 4>as long as the coach,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the coach is in the coaching charge,</v>

2190
01:41:01.370 --> 01:41:02.203
<v Speaker 4>it really smart.</v>

2191
01:41:02.310 --> 01:41:05.540
<v Speaker 6>They understand how to map you down.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's good.</v>

2192
01:41:05.720 --> 01:41:07.530
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And in the Alamo that curse on,</v>

2193
01:41:07.730 --> 01:41:10.880
<v Speaker 6>we're talking about what he's into his</v>
<v Speaker 6>all plyometrics man.</v>

2194
01:41:11.150 --> 01:41:13.160
<v Speaker 6>He barely has these guys lifting</v>
<v Speaker 6>weights.</v>

2195
01:41:13.340 --> 01:41:17.660
<v Speaker 6>He's got guys jumping over hurdles and</v>
<v Speaker 6>stuff and doing all these leap,</v>

2196
01:41:17.690 --> 01:41:20.870
<v Speaker 6>leaping back and forth and back and</v>
<v Speaker 6>forth and back and forth like he's all</v>

2197
01:41:20.871 --> 01:41:24.620
<v Speaker 6>about movement and in a plyometric way,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in an explosive way.</v>

2198
01:41:24.950 --> 01:41:28.100
<v Speaker 6>And that's one of the reasons why he</v>
<v Speaker 6>gets such great results out of his</v>

2199
01:41:28.101 --> 01:41:31.310
<v Speaker 6>fighters is because they,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they developed this extraordinary</v>

2200
01:41:31.311 --> 01:41:34.520
<v Speaker 6>ability to close the distance,</v>
<v Speaker 6>extraordinary ability to get out of the</v>

2201
01:41:34.521 --> 01:41:35.400
<v Speaker 6>way,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2202
01:41:35.660 --> 01:41:38.330
<v Speaker 6>the ability to move and then to stop</v>
<v Speaker 6>what you're doing.</v>

2203
01:41:38.331 --> 01:41:40.130
<v Speaker 6>And then counter quickly,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2204
01:41:40.131 --> 01:41:45.131
<v Speaker 6>all that stuff is just so giant cross</v>
<v Speaker 6>fit fit into everything we're discussing</v>

2205
01:41:45.381 --> 01:41:50.381
<v Speaker 6>right now because every studio city is</v>
<v Speaker 6>the fucking capital crossfit might know</v>

2206
01:41:51.080 --> 01:41:55.750
<v Speaker 6>you can't go anywhere in studio city</v>
<v Speaker 6>without seeing five guys my age rather</v>

2207
01:41:55.751 --> 01:41:58.310
<v Speaker 6>than down the street with a 50 pound</v>
<v Speaker 6>plate over the head.</v>

2208
01:41:58.700 --> 01:42:01.040
<v Speaker 6>And I'm sitting there going,</v>
<v Speaker 6>something's not right here.</v>

2209
01:42:01.700 --> 01:42:02.420
<v Speaker 6>What do you think</v>

2210
01:42:02.420 --> 01:42:04.320
<v Speaker 4>I've done in my what I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2211
01:42:04.480 --> 01:42:08.470
<v Speaker 4>I think crossfit at the beginning as</v>
<v Speaker 4>brilliant idea,</v>

2212
01:42:08.530 --> 01:42:11.780
<v Speaker 4>it was bringing back a lot of things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were disappearing like Olympic</v>

2213
01:42:11.810 --> 01:42:15.730
<v Speaker 4>weightlifting and gymnastic and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I think it was good.</v>

2214
01:42:16.450 --> 01:42:20.800
<v Speaker 4>You started to ruin the things when the</v>
<v Speaker 4>games came is when this become a really</v>

2215
01:42:20.801 --> 01:42:23.680
<v Speaker 4>an official sport and people that just</v>
<v Speaker 4>get crazy,</v>

2216
01:42:23.681 --> 01:42:24.850
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a competition.</v>

2217
01:42:24.851 --> 01:42:28.060
<v Speaker 4>So they just training with that goal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I need to beat the time,</v>

2218
01:42:28.061 --> 01:42:30.370
<v Speaker 4>I need to be depth things and they don't</v>
<v Speaker 4>understand,</v>

2219
01:42:30.371 --> 01:42:33.250
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is going to kill you at that speed,</v>

2220
01:42:33.251 --> 01:42:34.570
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that timing.</v>

2221
01:42:34.750 --> 01:42:36.680
<v Speaker 4>It's going to be too much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2222
01:42:37.810 --> 01:42:41.050
<v Speaker 4>But it needs 10.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those ligaments and muscles at times to</v>

2223
01:42:41.051 --> 01:42:43.110
<v Speaker 4>adopt,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and if you take an hour,</v>

2224
01:42:43.120 --> 01:42:47.020
<v Speaker 4>a weightlifter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he spent an entire life to do devcon to</v>

2225
01:42:47.021 --> 01:42:49.000
<v Speaker 4>learn that kind of moment perfectly.</v>

2226
01:42:49.100 --> 01:42:51.190
<v Speaker 4>Never,</v>
<v Speaker 4>never screw the movement and how many</v>

2227
01:42:51.191 --> 01:42:55.060
<v Speaker 4>reps he does in his competition.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One can die.</v>

2228
01:42:55.061 --> 01:42:58.960
<v Speaker 4>He can do that kind of a movement so</v>
<v Speaker 4>fast,</v>

2229
01:42:58.990 --> 01:43:00.640
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even if you lose the weight because you</v>

2230
01:43:00.641 --> 01:43:04.240
<v Speaker 4>can control one to three reps,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you might be using app.</v>

2231
01:43:04.570 --> 01:43:08.080
<v Speaker 4>I was talking to Michael.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Michael was one of the most successful</v>

2232
01:43:08.470 --> 01:43:11.440
<v Speaker 4>crossfit coach,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially here in southern California.</v>

2233
01:43:11.800 --> 01:43:16.800
<v Speaker 4>He used to have on as a big crossfit gym</v>
<v Speaker 4>and in vanize so and it was telling me</v>

2234
01:43:18.151 --> 01:43:19.960
<v Speaker 4>about he has more experience with me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Of course.</v>

2235
01:43:19.961 --> 01:43:21.430
<v Speaker 4>Cross with that was his business told</v>
<v Speaker 4>me,</v>

2236
01:43:21.670 --> 01:43:26.600
<v Speaker 4>I believe that if you do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you do when you are 20 years old or</v>

2237
01:43:26.601 --> 01:43:29.890
<v Speaker 4>something like this into the 30,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can speak a little bit.</v>

2238
01:43:29.891 --> 01:43:32.580
<v Speaker 4>Then if you are smart enough,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you understand that,</v>

2239
01:43:32.590 --> 01:43:37.390
<v Speaker 4>then you need to slow down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you train cross without thinking cap</v>

2240
01:43:37.391 --> 01:43:40.720
<v Speaker 4>time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>try to see online how much this guy did.</v>

2241
01:43:40.720 --> 01:43:44.370
<v Speaker 4>So I want to beat this guy and just</v>
<v Speaker 4>training smartly.</v>

2242
01:43:44.371 --> 01:43:48.680
<v Speaker 4>You do your weight lifting your rings</v>
<v Speaker 4>and when it's got to be good it's going</v>

2243
01:43:48.681 --> 01:43:53.240
<v Speaker 4>to be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if you just to as a sport is just</v>

2244
01:43:53.241 --> 01:43:55.760
<v Speaker 4>conditioning you for that part such as</v>
<v Speaker 4>crossfit.</v>

2245
01:43:55.790 --> 01:44:00.790
<v Speaker 4>You can conditioning Fujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 4>try to do at crossfit would with a cap</v>

2246
01:44:01.041 --> 01:44:03.850
<v Speaker 4>time because like you say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to be destroyed saying cup</v>

2247
01:44:03.950 --> 01:44:04.790
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What does that mean?</v>

2248
01:44:05.010 --> 01:44:06.560
<v Speaker 4>Now in our captain is like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

2249
01:44:06.561 --> 01:44:10.970
<v Speaker 4>you're supposed to do this and let's say</v>
<v Speaker 4>word Wod,</v>

2250
01:44:11.180 --> 01:44:13.360
<v Speaker 4>workout of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of the entertainers.</v>

2251
01:44:13.760 --> 01:44:16.010
<v Speaker 4>Let's say you're supposed to finish in</v>
<v Speaker 4>30 minutes.</v>

2252
01:44:16.240 --> 01:44:17.630
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You made me,</v>

2253
01:44:17.631 --> 01:44:19.390
<v Speaker 4>for me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it take 25 minutes,</v>

2254
01:44:19.710 --> 01:44:24.410
<v Speaker 4>about 25 minutes because I know that I</v>
<v Speaker 4>can control my movement and not going to</v>

2255
01:44:24.411 --> 01:44:27.740
<v Speaker 4>get an injury,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but most of the people they go online</v>

2256
01:44:27.741 --> 01:44:32.120
<v Speaker 4>because now there's want to see how much</v>
<v Speaker 4>time and it was telling me is crazy.</v>

2257
01:44:32.330 --> 01:44:35.270
<v Speaker 4>They need to rebuild the site,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the website,</v>

2258
01:44:35.990 --> 01:44:37.310
<v Speaker 4>and put more,</v>
<v Speaker 4>more,</v>

2259
01:44:38.150 --> 01:44:40.910
<v Speaker 4>more power because people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they go when they wake up in the</v>

2260

2262
01:44:44.120 --> 01:44:46.690
<v Speaker 4>Then when they go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they go to work,</v>

2263
01:44:46.700 --> 01:44:48.200

2265
01:44:50.810 --> 01:44:52.460

<v Speaker 4>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I'm going back the time and I</v>

01:44:57.590 --> 01:45:02.390
<v Speaker 4>this time now I go to the gym,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I try to do and put my time in the day.</v>

2270
01:45:02.450 --> 01:45:05.090
<v Speaker 4>In the evening I go like to see if</v>
<v Speaker 4>someone beat me.</v>

2271
01:45:05.300 --> 01:45:07.970
<v Speaker 4>So they go into this loop thing that</v>
<v Speaker 4>they want to compete,</v>

2272
01:45:08.450 --> 01:45:09.920
<v Speaker 4>compete,</v>
<v Speaker 4>compete for time,</v>

2273
01:45:09.980 --> 01:45:11.720
<v Speaker 4>and you're going to kill yourself.</v>

2274
01:45:11.750 --> 01:45:13.940
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Steve Maxwell said that he believes that</v>

2275
01:45:13.970 --> 01:45:18.050
<v Speaker 3>when you're doing is when you're lifting</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you're doing these Olympic lifts,</v>

2276
01:45:18.080 --> 01:45:22.580
<v Speaker 3>you should be doing a live make lefts to</v>
<v Speaker 3>get you stronger for another sport,</v>

2277
01:45:22.610 --> 01:45:25.010
<v Speaker 3>for a competition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't believe that it should be a</v>

2278
01:45:25.011 --> 01:45:26.500
<v Speaker 3>sport in itself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2279
01:45:26.630 --> 01:45:30.440
<v Speaker 3>And he also said that I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he doesn't believe in Olympic lifts for</v>

2280
01:45:30.441 --> 01:45:32.150
<v Speaker 3>high repetition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

2281
01:45:32.180 --> 01:45:34.410
<v Speaker 3>you're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just a recipe for injury because if</v>

2282
01:45:34.460 --> 01:45:36.770
<v Speaker 3>you're doing cleans and presses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he goes,</v>

2283
01:45:36.820 --> 01:45:38.990
<v Speaker 3>you watch Olympic lifters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they do one wrap,</v>

2284
01:45:39.170 --> 01:45:39.990
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2285
01:45:39.990 --> 01:45:43.280
<v Speaker 3>They're not doing it 30 times in a row</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know it.</v>

2286
01:45:43.400 --> 01:45:44.390
<v Speaker 3>Can it be done?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2287
01:45:44.391 --> 01:45:47.120
<v Speaker 3>You know what else can happen?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could drop that weight on your head</v>

2288
01:45:47.121 --> 01:45:49.480
<v Speaker 3>and die because your body's failing</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you're,</v>

2289
01:45:49.481 --> 01:45:51.350
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you did 14 reps and everybody's going,</v>

<v Speaker 3>That has happened.</v>

<v Speaker 3>It has happened.</v>

2294
01:46:03.590 --> 01:46:04.423
<v Speaker 4>It's about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you're saying,</v>

2295
01:46:04.700 --> 01:46:07.520
<v Speaker 4>it's the sport.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if you want to do a game show</v>

<v Speaker 3>Well there's guys that can do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they do do it.</v>

2299

<v Speaker 3>that can do it and they do do it.</v>

2301
01:46:18.211 --> 01:46:19.950
<v Speaker 3>But you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the person who's listening to this,</v>

2302
01:46:19.951 --> 01:46:23.400
<v Speaker 3>the average human being,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you are way better off following like a</v>

2303
01:46:23.401 --> 01:46:25.770
<v Speaker 3>strong first method,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2304
01:46:25.771 --> 01:46:29.200
<v Speaker 3>or like your method or Pavle teaches</v>
<v Speaker 3>where you're,</v>

2305
01:46:29.260 --> 01:46:30.070
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

2306
01:46:30.070 --> 01:46:32.280
<v Speaker 3>you lift the weights,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you don't go to failure.</v>

2307
01:46:32.310 --> 01:46:35.370
<v Speaker 3>Use great technique.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you want to get endurance,</v>

2308
01:46:35.520 --> 01:46:37.650
<v Speaker 3>run up a fucking hill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

2309
01:46:37.680 --> 01:46:40.080
<v Speaker 3>go do rounds on a heavy bag.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You want endurance,</v>

2310
01:46:40.170 --> 01:46:41.880
<v Speaker 3>do sprints and a heavy bag.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I do?</v>

2311
01:46:41.881 --> 01:46:46.881
<v Speaker 3>I have a timer and it times,</v>
<v Speaker 3>etc. For three minutes and every 30</v>

2312
01:46:47.521 --> 01:46:51.240
<v Speaker 3>seconds a buzzer goes off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's a bell and then every 30</v>

2313
01:46:51.241 --> 01:46:52.080
<v Speaker 3>seconds is a buzzer.</v>

2314
01:46:52.230 --> 01:46:54.840
<v Speaker 3>And when those 30 seconds hit eat</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fucking sprint.</v>

2315
01:46:54.990 --> 01:46:57.090
<v Speaker 3>So it's 30 seconds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>boom,</v>

2316
01:46:57.960 --> 01:46:59.160
<v Speaker 3>boom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>boom,</v>

2317
01:46:59.730 --> 01:47:01.830
<v Speaker 3>boom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just go fucking crazy for 30 seconds and</v>

2318
01:47:01.831 --> 01:47:05.110
<v Speaker 3>the next buzzer hits.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the next 30 seconds is so light and</v>

2319
01:47:05.190 --> 01:47:07.670
<v Speaker 3>the next 30 seconds I'm just sorta going</v>
<v Speaker 3>through the motions.</v>

2320
01:47:07.690 --> 01:47:09.060
<v Speaker 3>I'm kicking and punching,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

2321
01:47:09.130 --> 01:47:11.940
<v Speaker 3>and I'm waiting for that fucking buzzer</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that buzzer goes off.</v>

2322
01:47:11.941 --> 01:47:14.070
<v Speaker 3>And then I go off again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just do that.</v>

2323
01:47:14.071 --> 01:47:17.010
<v Speaker 3>If you want endurance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that'll give you phenomenal endurance,</v>

2324
01:47:17.250 --> 01:47:21.990
<v Speaker 3>but strength I am of the opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is just from the last few years</v>

2325
01:47:21.991 --> 01:47:25.980
<v Speaker 3>of me operating this way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you should do low repetitions and</v>

2326
01:47:25.981 --> 01:47:26.970
<v Speaker 3>he should do it more often.</v>

2327
01:47:27.180 --> 01:47:28.320
<v Speaker 5>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I agree with you.</v>

2328
01:47:28.380 --> 01:47:29.780
<v Speaker 5>That's what I do for me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I got better.</v>

2329
01:47:29.790 --> 01:47:32.270
<v Speaker 5>I got stronger than before and I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I,</v>

2330
01:47:32.500 --> 01:47:37.080
<v Speaker 5>I took my hormone truck,</v>
<v Speaker 5>trucker and understand I took my</v>

2331
01:47:37.081 --> 01:47:41.640
<v Speaker 5>cortisol level test and a lower lower</v>
<v Speaker 5>just to train like that.</v>

2332
01:47:42.360 --> 01:47:45.540
<v Speaker 5>Your stress lower wraps?</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2333
01:47:45.541 --> 01:47:46.230
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

2334
01:47:46.230 --> 01:47:48.660
<v Speaker 3>How do you schedule your own personal</v>
<v Speaker 3>workouts?</v>

2335
01:47:48.661 --> 01:47:50.790
<v Speaker 3>Do you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you have someone do it for you or do</v>

2336
01:47:50.791 --> 01:47:52.830
<v Speaker 3>you decide based on how your body's</v>
<v Speaker 3>feeling,</v>

2337
01:47:53.160 --> 01:47:53.700
<v Speaker 5>do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2341
01:48:03.541 --> 01:48:06.660
<v Speaker 5>that's an issue.</v>
<v Speaker 5>For example,</v>

<v Speaker 5>just for january,</v>
<v Speaker 5>from january 10 now I've been in</v>

01:50:06.041 --> 01:50:06.611
<v Speaker 6>joe.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

2385
01:50:06.611 --> 01:50:09.700
<v Speaker 6>that's because the tomatoes that you get</v>
<v Speaker 6>in the grocery stores are designed to</v>

2386
01:50:09.730 --> 01:50:11.440
<v Speaker 6>last longer.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're not designed to taste good.</v>

2387
01:50:11.470 --> 01:50:12.320
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I could if you</v>

2388
01:50:13.820 --> 01:50:16.930
<v Speaker 6>do as much as I got up yesterday,</v>
<v Speaker 6>early one kind of forum.</v>

2389
01:50:16.960 --> 01:50:21.130
<v Speaker 6>I try as much as I can mean I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I crave tomatoes,</v>

2390
01:50:21.850 --> 01:50:22.830
<v Speaker 6>heirloom tomatoes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>joy,</v>

2391
01:50:22.850 --> 01:50:24.370
<v Speaker 6>they look ugly.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They taste amazing.</v>

2392
01:50:24.380 --> 01:50:25.021
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I got it.</v>

2393
01:50:25.021 --> 01:50:27.040
<v Speaker 6>They only last like a few days.</v>
<v Speaker 6>A few days ago.</v>

2394
01:50:27.050 --> 01:50:28.960
<v Speaker 6>That's the problem because they're real</v>
<v Speaker 6>tomatoes,</v>

2395
01:50:29.140 --> 01:50:30.910
<v Speaker 6>they're not these fucking franken</v>
<v Speaker 6>tomatoes,</v>

2396
01:50:33.250 --> 01:50:33.640
<v Speaker 6>tomatoes.</v>

2397
01:50:33.640 --> 01:50:36.360
<v Speaker 6>They're hard and they're pale.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It cut into them like,</v>

2398
01:50:36.370 --> 01:50:39.160
<v Speaker 6>what is this a tomato or is this an app?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>

2399
01:50:39.161 --> 01:50:42.610
<v Speaker 6>what the fuck is this?</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's weird and you know that they only</v>

2400
01:50:42.611 --> 01:50:45.490
<v Speaker 6>do it so that they could keep them on</v>
<v Speaker 6>those trucks longer and drive around the</v>

2401
01:50:45.491 --> 01:50:49.260
<v Speaker 6>country with them and keep them on the</v>
<v Speaker 6>shelves and the grocery store produce</v>

2402
01:50:49.261 --> 01:50:50.094
<v Speaker 6>yet.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2403
01:50:50.110 --> 01:50:51.890
<v Speaker 6>we grow our own vegetables,</v>
<v Speaker 6>tomatoes,</v>

2404
01:50:52.270 --> 01:50:54.070
<v Speaker 6>we grow tomatoes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we grow kale,</v>

2405
01:50:54.820 --> 01:50:57.280
<v Speaker 6>squash,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we grow cucumbers.</v>

2406
01:50:57.640 --> 01:50:59.650
<v Speaker 6>We grow a lot of things.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2407
01:50:59.651 --> 01:51:00.460
<v Speaker 6>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

2408
01:51:00.460 --> 01:51:01.570
<v Speaker 6>if you can,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you should do it.</v>

2409
01:51:01.590 --> 01:51:04.720
<v Speaker 6>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's very satisfying to make a salad out</v>

2410
01:51:04.721 --> 01:51:07.540
<v Speaker 6>of something that you grew yourself and</v>
<v Speaker 6>just super healthy,</v>

2411
01:51:07.541 --> 01:51:08.440
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>where it came from,</v>

2412
01:51:08.830 --> 01:51:11.020
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we buy real healthy fertilizer,</v>

2413
01:51:11.320 --> 01:51:12.880
<v Speaker 6>good soil,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2414
01:51:13.510 --> 01:51:15.370
<v Speaker 6>and I think good soil is really</v>
<v Speaker 6>important to.</v>

2415
01:51:15.380 --> 01:51:17.110
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I hAve a friend who lived in brooklyn</v>

2416
01:51:17.350 --> 01:51:18.700
<v Speaker 6>and he got a soil tested.</v>

2417
01:51:19.520 --> 01:51:23.440
<v Speaker 6>It turned out that the ground was</v>
<v Speaker 6>contaminated with lead from back when</v>

2418
01:51:23.441 --> 01:51:26.560
<v Speaker 6>they used to have lead gasoline when</v>
<v Speaker 6>they had leaded gasoline.</v>

2419
01:51:26.770 --> 01:51:29.230
<v Speaker 6>Like all that shit goes up in the air</v>
<v Speaker 6>and it all comes down,</v>

2420
01:51:29.231 --> 01:51:33.190
<v Speaker 6>it's in your soil and it was in his soil</v>
<v Speaker 6>and there's different plants that you</v>

2421
01:51:33.191 --> 01:51:36.010
<v Speaker 6>could plant that will draw it out of the</v>
<v Speaker 6>soil.</v>

2422
01:51:36.850 --> 01:51:40.420
<v Speaker 6>Or the best solution I think is if you</v>
<v Speaker 6>have a yard,</v>

2423
01:51:40.480 --> 01:51:45.480
<v Speaker 6>just get potted plants,</v>
<v Speaker 6>just get those big wooden boxes and grow</v>

2424
01:51:45.491 --> 01:51:48.310
<v Speaker 6>the plants in there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's the best way because then you can</v>

2425
01:51:48.340 --> 01:51:50.890
<v Speaker 6>completely control what soil they grow</v>
<v Speaker 6>in.</v>

2426
01:51:50.891 --> 01:51:51.641
<v Speaker 6>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2427
01:51:51.641 --> 01:51:53.560
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's just a very contained environment.</v>

2428
01:51:53.561 --> 01:51:57.160
<v Speaker 6>So that's how we do it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We have these big potters and you know,</v>

2429
01:51:57.161 --> 01:52:00.160
<v Speaker 6>we grow watermelons and all kinds of</v>
<v Speaker 6>course,</v>

2430
01:52:00.161 --> 01:52:04.190
<v Speaker 6>because that would be my world to become</v>
<v Speaker 6>an old italian man.</v>

2431
01:52:04.550 --> 01:52:08.720
<v Speaker 6>Roll up your pants,</v>
<v Speaker 6>get a synagogue and oh,</v>

2432
01:52:08.740 --> 01:52:11.650
<v Speaker 6>I'd love it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I love it right now.</v>

2433
01:52:11.730 --> 01:52:14.050
<v Speaker 6>Over right now everything's so green out</v>
<v Speaker 6>here.</v>

2434
01:52:14.051 --> 01:52:15.310
<v Speaker 6>It's so amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Beautiful.</v>

2435
01:52:15.311 --> 01:52:18.430
<v Speaker 6>Because it's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's amazing.</v>

2436
01:52:19.660 --> 01:52:22.030
<v Speaker 6>He's been around in there like crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2437
01:52:22.031 --> 01:52:25.270
<v Speaker 6>We had a drought for five years and then</v>
<v Speaker 6>this year it's just been flooded.</v>

2438
01:52:25.271 --> 01:52:27.850
<v Speaker 6>They had a giant break of a dam in</v>
<v Speaker 6>sacramento.</v>

2439
01:52:27.940 --> 01:52:28.830
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's true.</v>

2440
01:52:29.540 --> 01:52:31.660
<v Speaker 6>I was in Panama.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What happened?</v>

2441
01:52:31.661 --> 01:52:33.370
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's fucking awesome.</v>

2442
01:52:33.550 --> 01:52:35.680
<v Speaker 6>Awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's this thing called the glory</v>

2443
01:52:35.681 --> 01:52:37.870
<v Speaker 6>hole.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The morning glory hole up northern</v>

2444
01:52:37.871 --> 01:52:40.480
<v Speaker 6>California.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It'S this crazy hole that's in this lake</v>

2445
01:52:40.930 --> 01:52:45.930
<v Speaker 6>and it hadn't operated in 10 years.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It hadn't been doing it because it's</v>

2446
01:52:46.251 --> 01:52:48.260
<v Speaker 6>like this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like a vortex,</v>

2447
01:52:48.261 --> 01:52:50.690
<v Speaker 6>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what do they call those when it spins</v>

2448
01:52:50.691 --> 01:52:51.640
<v Speaker 6>like that?</v>
<v Speaker 6>What do they call it?</v>

2449
01:52:51.730 --> 01:52:55.520
<v Speaker 6>A textbook.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So it's sucks this whole somehow or</v>

2450
01:52:55.521 --> 01:52:57.860
<v Speaker 6>another when the water level gets to a</v>
<v Speaker 6>certain point,</v>

2451
01:52:58.160 --> 01:52:59.390
<v Speaker 6>it develops as whole.</v>

2452
01:52:59.390 --> 01:53:03.140
<v Speaker 6>And this lake and it wasn't there for 10</v>
<v Speaker 6>years and now it's finally back again</v>

2453
01:53:03.500 --> 01:53:05.570
<v Speaker 6>for the first time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah,</v>

2454
01:53:05.660 --> 01:53:07.460
<v Speaker 6>there it is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Isn't that nuts?</v>

2455
01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:09.120
<v Speaker 6>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2456
01:53:09.170 --> 01:53:12.440
<v Speaker 6>So for 10 years the water level wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 6>high enough for that actually to be</v>

2457
01:53:12.441 --> 01:53:14.160
<v Speaker 6>happening and now it's finally happening</v>
<v Speaker 6>again.</v>

2458
01:53:14.210 --> 01:53:18.380
<v Speaker 6>People were all excited,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so it's pretty much over all of the.</v>

2459
01:53:18.410 --> 01:53:22.700
<v Speaker 6>The drought issues that we had here in</v>
<v Speaker 6>California are pretty much all tell this</v>

2460
01:53:22.701 --> 01:53:26.540

<v Speaker 6>this other tv for so long.</v>

<v Speaker 6>companion on saturday.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We can't have this happening.</v>

2465
01:53:37.280 --> 01:53:38.780
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but anyway.</v>

2466
01:53:39.050 --> 01:53:41.480
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So you take a protein protein?</v>

2467
01:53:41.690 --> 01:53:42.560
<v Speaker 6>Honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

2468
01:53:43.140 --> 01:53:48.140
<v Speaker 6>I very rarely to protein if I have to,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like if I'm running and I'm low on food,</v>

2469
01:53:49.340 --> 01:53:51.470
<v Speaker 6>I haven't eaten anything but I know I'm</v>
<v Speaker 6>going to work out.</v>

2470
01:53:51.950 --> 01:53:54.080
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I like hemp protein because I can take</v>

2471
01:53:54.081 --> 01:53:57.680
<v Speaker 6>like a glass of hemp protein with</v>
<v Speaker 6>coconut water and I could,</v>

2472
01:53:58.040 --> 01:54:01.580
<v Speaker 6>I could work out in 30 minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like no problem because it digests so</v>

2473
01:54:01.581 --> 01:54:03.930
<v Speaker 6>easily.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's Just goes right into your system.</v>

2474
01:54:03.940 --> 01:54:05.600
<v Speaker 6>So easy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a nice light.</v>

2475
01:54:05.900 --> 01:54:06.500
<v Speaker 6>It's only,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2476
01:54:06.500 --> 01:54:08.410
<v Speaker 6>you're only dealing like 16 grams of</v>
<v Speaker 6>protein.</v>

2477
01:54:08.411 --> 01:54:11.960
<v Speaker 6>It's nothing too crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But most of my protein I get from meat</v>

2478
01:54:12.180 --> 01:54:14.720
<v Speaker 6>or real food.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's what we were discussing in the</v>

2479
01:54:14.721 --> 01:54:15.590
<v Speaker 6>car.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2480
01:54:15.690 --> 01:54:19.190
<v Speaker 6>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If I'm on the plane and I didn't get the</v>

2481
01:54:19.191 --> 01:54:20.840
<v Speaker 6>chance to cook my food and things of the</v>
<v Speaker 6>plane,</v>

<v Speaker 6>I got some product.</v>

2483
01:54:22.220 --> 01:54:24.890
<v Speaker 6>But otherwise I like to get some old</v>
<v Speaker 6>food.</v>

2484
01:54:26.360 --> 01:54:28.400
<v Speaker 6>If I knew I was traveling and I couldn't</v>
<v Speaker 6>get it,</v>

2485
01:54:28.401 --> 01:54:30.530

01:55:06.530 --> 01:55:11.530
<v Speaker 6>I don't need to have to jujitsu a drink.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That protein powder because I mixed them</v>

01:55:12.081 --> 01:55:13.090
<v Speaker 6>up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I used to have,</v>

2500
01:55:13.550 --> 01:55:15.290

2504
01:55:22.730 --> 01:55:24.350
<v Speaker 6>The key is low sugar.</v>

2505
01:55:24.410 --> 01:55:27.560
<v Speaker 6>That is the key to eliminate as much</v>
<v Speaker 6>sugar in your diet.</v>

2506
01:55:27.561 --> 01:55:28.311
<v Speaker 6>And by the way,</v>

2507
01:55:28.311 --> 01:55:31.370

2508
01:55:31.371 --> 01:55:33.350
<v Speaker 6>big glass of orange juice in the morning</v>
<v Speaker 6>and it's healthy.</v>

2509
01:55:33.351 --> 01:55:35.960
<v Speaker 6>So worst thing ever.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's so crazy.</v>

2510
01:55:35.961 --> 01:55:39.170
<v Speaker 6>We thought that was healthy for so long.</v>
<v Speaker 6>For so long we thought,</v>

2511
01:55:39.171 --> 01:55:40.570

2515
01:55:47.700 --> 01:55:50.430

<v Speaker 6>The more sugar you can cut out of your</v>

2516
01:55:50.431 --> 01:55:51.264
<v Speaker 6>diet,</v>

<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2612
02:00:01.370 --> 02:00:05.050

<v Speaker 6>And we were talking about date night on</v>

2613
02:00:05.051 --> 02:00:05.884
<v Speaker 6>fridays.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I got,</v>

2614
02:00:05.890 --> 02:00:09.910
<v Speaker 6>I got the bill of lading sent that once</v>
<v Speaker 6>they give you the bill of lading that</v>

2615
02:00:09.911 --> 02:00:14.911
<v Speaker 6>makes sense over the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the act of the act of 2017 that the dea</v>

2616
02:00:15.880 --> 02:00:17.740
<v Speaker 6>is household friday night.</v>

2617
02:00:17.740 --> 02:00:20.740
<v Speaker 6>His wives dog give a fuck about you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Stand up no more.</v>

2618
02:00:20.741 --> 02:00:22.780
<v Speaker 6>I gotta get out here.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I got a four year old that drives me</v>

2619
02:00:22.781 --> 02:00:24.160
<v Speaker 6>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So friday night's date,</v>

2620
02:00:24.161 --> 02:00:26.310
<v Speaker 6>night to official.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know what man,</v>

<v Speaker 6>too,</v>

2622
02:00:27.730 --> 02:00:32.350
<v Speaker 6>that in town it's maybe sometimes even</v>
<v Speaker 6>best to not go out on the weekends and</v>

2623
02:00:32.351 --> 02:00:35.470
<v Speaker 6>work because even though it's good to</v>
<v Speaker 6>work and it's good to like get your</v>

2624
02:00:35.471 --> 02:00:37.810
<v Speaker 6>standup and on the weekends everybody's</v>
<v Speaker 6>there to see the big show.</v>

2625
02:00:37.811 --> 02:00:39.160
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But for us,</v>

2626
02:00:39.640 --> 02:00:42.460
<v Speaker 6>especially now for me it's only a couple</v>
<v Speaker 6>months.</v>

2627
02:00:42.461 --> 02:00:45.520
<v Speaker 6>It's my special came out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And for you it's just a month and a</v>

2628
02:00:45.520 --> 02:00:45.761
<v Speaker 6>half.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

2629
02:00:45.761 --> 02:00:47.230
<v Speaker 6>When did your special come out?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Three months ago.</v>

2630
02:00:47.231 --> 02:00:48.064
<v Speaker 6>December,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

2631
02:00:48.150 --> 02:00:49.730
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So for me it's three months to.</v>

2632
02:00:49.820 --> 02:00:51.790
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so when,</v>

2633
02:00:51.791 --> 02:00:54.340
<v Speaker 6>when that happens,</v>
<v Speaker 6>or four months when that happens,</v>

2634
02:00:54.341 --> 02:00:57.490
<v Speaker 6>your shit comes out and then you're in</v>
<v Speaker 6>this scramble mode where you're trying</v>

2635
02:00:57.491 --> 02:00:58.324
<v Speaker 6>to create.</v>

2636
02:00:58.750 --> 02:01:00.790
<v Speaker 6>And what I like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what you're doing is you're going to</v>

2637
02:01:00.791 --> 02:01:04.600
<v Speaker 6>these hole in the walls,</v>
<v Speaker 6>goes weird places and show up and work</v>

2638
02:01:04.601 --> 02:01:06.100
<v Speaker 6>your material out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And these joints,</v>

2639
02:01:06.370 --> 02:01:08.200
<v Speaker 6>you go to the comedy store on a friday</v>
<v Speaker 6>night,</v>

2640
02:01:08.500 --> 02:01:11.950
<v Speaker 6>there's 400 fucking people.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's packed to the gills and everybody's</v>

2641
02:01:11.951 --> 02:01:14.290
<v Speaker 6>doing their best 15 minutes over and</v>
<v Speaker 6>over and over again.</v>

2642
02:01:14.291 --> 02:01:16.140
<v Speaker 6>And one of the things that I noticed</v>
<v Speaker 6>when I went there recently,</v>

2643
02:01:16.630 --> 02:01:19.570
<v Speaker 6>a lot of these guys that aren't doing a</v>
<v Speaker 6>specials,</v>

2644
02:01:19.730 --> 02:01:21.520
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's a lot of young guys coming up in</v>

2645
02:01:21.521 --> 02:01:23.890
<v Speaker 6>particular that they don't have any</v>
<v Speaker 6>specials.</v>

2646
02:01:24.330 --> 02:01:26.280
<v Speaker 6>They,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're not releasing any materials.</v>

2647
02:01:26.281 --> 02:01:28.600
<v Speaker 6>So they're doing the same material every</v>
<v Speaker 6>time.</v>

2648
02:01:28.601 --> 02:01:32.310
<v Speaker 6>I see them for fucking years now,</v>
<v Speaker 6>for two years when I've been coming</v>

2649
02:01:32.330 --> 02:01:34.150
<v Speaker 6>there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's certain comedians that have been</v>

2650
02:01:34.151 --> 02:01:36.790
<v Speaker 6>doing the same act every time I work</v>
<v Speaker 6>with them.</v>

2651
02:01:37.090 --> 02:01:41.120
<v Speaker 6>So what they're doing is they're</v>
<v Speaker 6>tightening up this hard 15 minutes and</v>

2652
02:01:41.121 --> 02:01:41.870
<v Speaker 6>they're doing it all the time.</v>

2653
02:01:41.870 --> 02:01:45.290
<v Speaker 6>And you know how to do that 15 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't think that's helping you.</v>

2654
02:01:45.890 --> 02:01:48.200
<v Speaker 6>And I don't think it's a lot of ways is</v>
<v Speaker 6>not helping me.</v>

2655
02:01:48.201 --> 02:01:49.450
<v Speaker 6>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what would really help?</v>

2656
02:01:49.470 --> 02:01:53.840
<v Speaker 6>Because you do long sets on the road.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you go somewhere and you're doing an</v>

2657
02:01:53.840 --> 02:01:55.580
<v Speaker 6>hour and you do have two shows on a</v>
<v Speaker 6>friday,</v>

2658
02:01:55.581 --> 02:01:57.650
<v Speaker 6>two shows on a saturday,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's what helps.</v>

2659
02:01:57.920 --> 02:02:02.060
<v Speaker 6>That's where it's at.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a the podcast.</v>

2660
02:02:02.570 --> 02:02:06.110
<v Speaker 6>Because just the way my office building</v>
<v Speaker 6>is,</v>

2661
02:02:06.500 --> 02:02:08.360
<v Speaker 6>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I can't go in there in the daytime and</v>

2662
02:02:08.361 --> 02:02:10.670
<v Speaker 6>smoke a pound in the pot and played loud</v>
<v Speaker 6>music.</v>

2663
02:02:11.270 --> 02:02:13.070
<v Speaker 6>I just can't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I don't want to do it.</v>

2664
02:02:13.071 --> 02:02:16.310
<v Speaker 6>So I prefer to do it at night when I'm</v>
<v Speaker 6>going to have a gun to my head.</v>

2665
02:02:16.850 --> 02:02:18.710
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if I come here at 1:00,</v>

2666
02:02:18.711 --> 02:02:20.390
<v Speaker 6>joe,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and we have to sit here till four,</v>

2667
02:02:20.600 --> 02:02:22.640
<v Speaker 6>from three to four,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to be fidgety or out of</v>

2668
02:02:22.641 --> 02:02:24.920
<v Speaker 6>control because I'm thinking about that</v>
<v Speaker 6>fucking traffic.</v>

2669
02:02:25.440 --> 02:02:27.620
<v Speaker 6>I want you to do podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't want you to think of nothing.</v>

2670
02:02:27.740 --> 02:02:28.910
<v Speaker 6>I don't want you to think of nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>bro.</v>

2671
02:02:29.340 --> 02:02:32.150
<v Speaker 6>If you got a spot,</v>
<v Speaker 6>don't do my podcast because we might go</v>

2672
02:02:32.151 --> 02:02:33.590
<v Speaker 6>on a tangent.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's brilliant.</v>

2673
02:02:33.610 --> 02:02:35.060
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and you got to leave for a stupid</v>

2674
02:02:35.061 --> 02:02:36.050
<v Speaker 6>fucking spot.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've no,</v>

2675
02:02:36.200 --> 02:02:39.440

<v Speaker 6>Then I tried to do comedy two,</v>

2676
02:02:39.441 --> 02:02:41.120
<v Speaker 6>three times a week,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but now I'm doubling up.</v>

02:02:48.441 --> 02:02:49.700
<v Speaker 6>I'm supposed to do at one of these</v>
<v Speaker 6>times.</v>

<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

2684
02:02:58.911 --> 02:03:00.170
<v Speaker 6>I'm not doing it tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 6>How come?</v>

2685
02:03:00.440 --> 02:03:02.180
<v Speaker 6>Because I did it last night.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

2686
02:03:02.181 --> 02:03:03.290
<v Speaker 6>I did two yesterday.</v>

2687
02:03:03.440 --> 02:03:04.420
<v Speaker 6>Oh nice.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Nice.</v>

2688
02:03:04.421 --> 02:03:06.590
<v Speaker 6>Did the undercover cop finally.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

2689
02:03:06.591 --> 02:03:11.591
<v Speaker 6>how was that joe fucking to be close to</v>
<v Speaker 6>a killer for 18 months.</v>

2690
02:03:11.901 --> 02:03:15.560
<v Speaker 6>We sprays sinai and your face.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's what he was doing.</v>

2691
02:03:15.561 --> 02:03:17.240
<v Speaker 6>He was chasing this guy that was the ice</v>
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>

2692
02:03:17.241 --> 02:03:18.500
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>He was chasing the ice man.</v>

2693
02:03:18.501 --> 02:03:22.880
<v Speaker 6>So he had a medium and the iceman for</v>
<v Speaker 6>the only reason why the ice made contact</v>

2694
02:03:22.881 --> 02:03:25.620
<v Speaker 6>with him was because he heard he could</v>
<v Speaker 6>get different guns and you know,</v>

2695
02:03:25.640 --> 02:03:28.770
<v Speaker 6>he was atf.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So when the ice man contacts me,</v>

2696
02:03:28.780 --> 02:03:32.840
<v Speaker 6>he wanted sinai.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So he kept saying bring me the sinai and</v>

2697
02:03:32.841 --> 02:03:36.890
<v Speaker 6>then he was going to sell him arms.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So for 18 months this guy had contact</v>

2698
02:03:36.891 --> 02:03:37.830
<v Speaker 6>with this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I had met him,</v>

2699
02:03:37.880 --> 02:03:40.760
<v Speaker 6>meet him at a diner,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he said he would hold his gun,</v>

2700
02:03:40.790 --> 02:03:45.260
<v Speaker 6>pointed right at him when he would meet</v>
<v Speaker 6>with him under the table or under the</v>

2701
02:03:45.261 --> 02:03:45.650
<v Speaker 6>table.</v>

2702
02:03:45.650 --> 02:03:49.460
<v Speaker 6>But you also had to sit outside.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You always tell them to sit outside</v>

2703
02:03:49.461 --> 02:03:54.461
<v Speaker 6>because he didn't want to be downwind of</v>
<v Speaker 6>the sinai just in case he's because he</v>

2704
02:03:55.010 --> 02:03:56.960
<v Speaker 6>just sprayed in your face,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're done.</v>

2705
02:03:57.110 --> 02:03:59.730
<v Speaker 6>So he was always worrying this guy was</v>
<v Speaker 6>going to ice them,</v>

2706
02:04:00.930 --> 02:04:03.170
<v Speaker 6>like literally isom literally.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>

2707
02:04:03.230 --> 02:04:05.480
<v Speaker 6>And then he would kill it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You call me ice man.</v>

2708
02:04:05.481 --> 02:04:06.890
<v Speaker 6>For people who don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he,</v>

2709
02:04:06.891 --> 02:04:08.870
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>would kill somebody and then throw them</v>

2710
02:04:08.871 --> 02:04:12.110
<v Speaker 6>in the freezer in his basement for like</v>
<v Speaker 6>seven,</v>

2711
02:04:12.111 --> 02:04:13.880
<v Speaker 6>eight months.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So they disappear.</v>

2712
02:04:14.030 --> 02:04:16.520
<v Speaker 6>And then he put them in this fucking</v>
<v Speaker 6>basement and then he would toss the body</v>

2713
02:04:16.521 --> 02:04:19.160
<v Speaker 6>somewhere so it confused the fuck out of</v>
<v Speaker 6>people.</v>

2714
02:04:19.161 --> 02:04:21.560
<v Speaker 6>They didn't know when the guy died</v>
<v Speaker 6>because it would thaw out.</v>

2715
02:04:21.590 --> 02:04:23.640
<v Speaker 6>And then they be like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>why is this kind of frostbite on them?</v>

2716
02:04:23.641 --> 02:04:26.030
<v Speaker 6>What the fuck is this guy's intestines?</v>
<v Speaker 6>The fresh?</v>

2717
02:04:26.090 --> 02:04:28.130
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like his intestines were still fresh.</v>

2718
02:04:28.160 --> 02:04:30.650
<v Speaker 6>Meanwhile the guy had disappeared six</v>
<v Speaker 6>months ago,</v>

2719
02:04:31.610 --> 02:04:34.580
<v Speaker 6>so they call them the ice man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And he kept these fucking people in his</v>

2720
02:04:34.581 --> 02:04:37.560
<v Speaker 6>basement.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know how cold blooded you have to be</v>

2721
02:04:37.580 --> 02:04:38.413
<v Speaker 6>the</v>

2722
02:04:38.960 --> 02:04:40.870
<v Speaker 2>you're going to sleep in your basement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to.</v>

2723
02:04:41.070 --> 02:04:43.760

<v Speaker 2>like slowly but surely.</v>

2764
02:06:35.761 --> 02:06:40.080
<v Speaker 2>And then they would cut them up in their</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking bathtub and then they had this</v>

2765
02:06:40.081 --> 02:06:42.210
<v Speaker 2>one apartment where they would take</v>
<v Speaker 2>these people to,</v>

2766
02:06:42.211 --> 02:06:44.910
<v Speaker 2>that was above this bar that they would</v>
<v Speaker 2>go to.</v>

2767
02:06:45.220 --> 02:06:49.140
<v Speaker 2>They take these people upstairs and</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking kill him and they killed so many</v>

2768
02:06:49.141 --> 02:06:50.130
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

2769
02:06:50.310 --> 02:06:54.120
<v Speaker 2>there were animals because it wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>even for business anymore.</v>

2770
02:06:55.600 --> 02:07:00.420
<v Speaker 2>It was like he disrespected me like it</v>
<v Speaker 2>would listen to me called my sister fat.</v>

2771
02:07:00.900 --> 02:07:02.610
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You gotta walk them upstairs.</v>

2772
02:07:02.611 --> 02:07:05.910
<v Speaker 2>They'd shoot them and stuff and they'd</v>
<v Speaker 2>hang them and they'd cook.</v>

2773
02:07:06.510 --> 02:07:08.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they'd wait for the body to drain.</v>

2774
02:07:09.410 --> 02:07:09.530
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2775
02:07:09.530 --> 02:07:12.630
<v Speaker 2>They would cut the neck and hang them</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so that the blood would drain out of</v>

2776
02:07:12.631 --> 02:07:14.880
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go in and chop them up and put them</v>

2777
02:07:14.881 --> 02:07:17.970
<v Speaker 2>around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who does this shit fucking sleep at</v>

2778
02:07:17.971 --> 02:07:19.230
<v Speaker 2>night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>

2779
02:07:19.231 --> 02:07:21.270
<v Speaker 2>I could see somebody calls you a</v>
<v Speaker 2>motherfucking.</v>

2780
02:07:21.271 --> 02:07:22.440
<v Speaker 2>You shoot them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shit happens.</v>

2781
02:07:22.441 --> 02:07:26.610
<v Speaker 2>You know somebody owe you $10,000.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somebody hits your sister with caught,</v>

2782
02:07:26.640 --> 02:07:29.760
<v Speaker 2>but the just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were just doing shit to prove that</v>

2783
02:07:29.761 --> 02:07:31.410
<v Speaker 2>they were animals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's animal shit.</v>

2784
02:07:31.470 --> 02:07:33.810
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think what happens is you get used to</v>

2785
02:07:33.811 --> 02:07:36.880
<v Speaker 2>doing it just like we were talking about</v>
<v Speaker 2>fighting and the more you fight,</v>

2786
02:07:36.940 --> 02:07:40.450
<v Speaker 2>the more you get comfortable with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's something that happens</v>

2787
02:07:40.451 --> 02:07:42.840
<v Speaker 2>to people when they kill people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They get real comfortable with it and</v>

2788
02:07:42.841 --> 02:07:45.010
<v Speaker 2>the more comfortable they get with it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the easier it is.</v>

2789
02:07:45.190 --> 02:07:48.070
<v Speaker 2>And then they start getting a rush out</v>
<v Speaker 2>of doing it and there's also this power</v>

2790
02:07:48.071 --> 02:07:50.820
<v Speaker 2>to know that this guy walking around and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2791
02:07:50.890 --> 02:07:52.510
<v Speaker 2>his wife thinks he's coming home and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

2792
02:07:52.511 --> 02:07:53.770
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not coming home.</v>

2793
02:07:54.370 --> 02:07:59.370
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to just stop this right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that it's almost like they get a</v>

2794
02:07:59.411 --> 02:08:02.680
<v Speaker 2>thrill out of playing god in a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>ways.</v>

2795
02:08:02.790 --> 02:08:03.623
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was,</v>

2796
02:08:03.790 --> 02:08:05.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I read the,</v>

2797
02:08:05.440 --> 02:08:08.740
<v Speaker 2>before I spoke to him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he told me to read a different book.</v>

2798
02:08:09.070 --> 02:08:10.970
<v Speaker 2>I had read a different book on the ice</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2799
02:08:11.470 --> 02:08:13.150
<v Speaker 2>And he told me to read a different book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>

2800
02:08:13.151 --> 02:08:15.820
<v Speaker 2>this was our conversation earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What book did you read?</v>

2801
02:08:15.920 --> 02:08:16.840
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>it was a different author.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This one was by anthony,</v>

2803
02:08:19.871 --> 02:08:22.890
<v Speaker 2>brutal called the iceman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The one I had read before,</v>

2804
02:08:22.910 --> 02:08:26.770
<v Speaker 2>carl was by a different office.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something called up and they said he</v>

2805
02:08:26.771 --> 02:08:29.380
<v Speaker 2>had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had caught the iceman later when he</v>

2806
02:08:29.381 --> 02:08:32.620
<v Speaker 2>had become more exaggerated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I killed kennedy because towards,</v>

2807
02:08:32.621 --> 02:08:34.240
<v Speaker 2>do you have any killed everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was dead when</v>

2808
02:08:36.130 --> 02:08:38.740
<v Speaker 2>he found out that he was getting</v>
<v Speaker 2>people's deckard.</v>

2809
02:08:39.190 --> 02:08:41.680
<v Speaker 2>So this guy wrote the early,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when it's really weird,</v>

2810
02:08:41.960 --> 02:08:43.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his dad just beat the shit out of them,</v>

2811
02:08:43.910 --> 02:08:45.970
<v Speaker 2>beat the shit out of the mother jersey</v>
<v Speaker 2>city.</v>

2812
02:08:45.990 --> 02:08:47.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just made him a monster,</v>

2813
02:08:48.070 --> 02:08:49.810
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no depth between jersey city and</v>

2814
02:08:49.811 --> 02:08:51.210
<v Speaker 2>hoboken,</v>
<v Speaker 2>new work,</v>

2815
02:08:51.610 --> 02:08:54.430
<v Speaker 2>same animals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he said that there was a kid that</v>

2816
02:08:54.431 --> 02:08:57.490
<v Speaker 2>would always call them polk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had to wear the same clothes to</v>

2817
02:08:57.491 --> 02:08:59.950
<v Speaker 2>school every day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You had no money,</v>

2818
02:08:59.951 --> 02:09:01.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

2819
02:09:01.481 --> 02:09:03.760
<v Speaker 2>the kid caught,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he described his first murder.</v>

2820
02:09:04.090 --> 02:09:07.600
<v Speaker 2>You know how he got a stick and waited</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the kid to come home.</v>

2821
02:09:07.630 --> 02:09:09.740
<v Speaker 2>He was 14,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2822
02:09:10.240 --> 02:09:14.410
<v Speaker 2>when you kill somebody at 14.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought he killed a guy at a bar with</v>

2823
02:09:14.411 --> 02:09:15.660
<v Speaker 2>a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought he killed a guy,</v>

2824
02:09:15.770 --> 02:09:17.410
<v Speaker 2>strangled him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was the member.</v>

2825
02:09:17.411 --> 02:09:19.960
<v Speaker 2>He lit the one guy on fire like he</v>
<v Speaker 2>wants.</v>

2826
02:09:19.960 --> 02:09:23.440
<v Speaker 2>But the first guy he got was this young</v>
<v Speaker 2>guy and he wouldn't give his name.</v>

2827
02:09:23.441 --> 02:09:26.800
<v Speaker 2>He beat him up with the two by four.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he went upstairs and the next</v>

2828
02:09:26.801 --> 02:09:29.650
<v Speaker 2>morning the cops were outside.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He thought he just drew a beating on</v>

2829
02:09:29.651 --> 02:09:32.200
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't know he killed him,</v>

2830
02:09:32.410 --> 02:09:34.720
<v Speaker 2>so he was scared.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He kept puking and he kept going to</v>

2831
02:09:34.721 --> 02:09:38.590
<v Speaker 2>school and thinking that people would</v>
<v Speaker 2>know and after that that's it.</v>

2832
02:09:38.620 --> 02:09:40.080
<v Speaker 2>Once you get away with it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like a,</v>

2833
02:09:40.090 --> 02:09:43.240
<v Speaker 2>what's the taste,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the taste tastes in your mouth.</v>

2834
02:09:43.690 --> 02:09:46.150
<v Speaker 2>And then he started going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had an argument with a guy over pool</v>

2835
02:09:47.170 --> 02:09:51.910
<v Speaker 2>and he beat him in the head with a pool</v>
<v Speaker 2>cue 30 fucking times and then he got</v>

2836

<v Speaker 2>into another beef where he shot the guy</v>
<v Speaker 2>outside,</v>

2837
02:09:54.471 --> 02:09:57.090
<v Speaker 2>but we left the car on fire with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>body in it.</v>

<v Speaker 2>mistake.</v>

2906
02:12:50.440 --> 02:12:53.020
<v Speaker 2>And the guy got me the liquid acid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2907
02:12:53.021 --> 02:12:55.510
<v Speaker 2>I called him and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

2908
02:12:55.511 --> 02:12:58.090
<v Speaker 2>I got a liquid ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you could hear him getting</v>

2909
02:12:58.091 --> 02:13:00.970
<v Speaker 2>anxiety on the phone because I don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>know.</v>

2910
02:13:01.890 --> 02:13:03.640
<v Speaker 2>You could hear a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he goes,</v>

2911
02:13:03.641 --> 02:13:05.140
<v Speaker 2>how are we going to do it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

2912
02:13:05.141 --> 02:13:07.570
<v Speaker 2>so we're going to get sugar cubes and</v>
<v Speaker 2>put the acid on it.</v>

2913
02:13:08.110 --> 02:13:09.580
<v Speaker 2>But I called them back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I a daily.</v>

2914
02:13:09.660 --> 02:13:11.890
<v Speaker 2>I hadn't had no assets and I had no</v>
<v Speaker 2>sugar cubes.</v>

2915
02:13:12.700 --> 02:13:13.960
<v Speaker 2>I just made it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

2916
02:13:13.961 --> 02:13:16.540
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just put the acid on the cube sugar</v>

2917
02:13:16.541 --> 02:13:19.630
<v Speaker 2>cubes and I put them in a tupperware and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I put a lid on it and I left.</v>

2918
02:13:19.631 --> 02:13:21.160
<v Speaker 2>And when I came back to lynn had blown</v>
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>

2919
02:13:21.670 --> 02:13:24.370
<v Speaker 2>So whenever that acid is going to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>really fucking strong,</v>

2920
02:13:24.700 --> 02:13:26.260
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I put aluminum foil over.</v>

2921
02:13:26.260 --> 02:13:30.610
<v Speaker 2>It would hold so it could breathe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the acid won't fucking go into.</v>

2922
02:13:30.611 --> 02:13:32.370
<v Speaker 2>Oh my god.</v>
