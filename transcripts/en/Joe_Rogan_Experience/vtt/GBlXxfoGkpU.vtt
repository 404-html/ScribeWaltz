1
00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.860
<v Speaker 1>Two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one end.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm great.</v>

4
00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.440
<v Speaker 1>It's going on brother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

5
00:00:07.441 --> 00:00:10.170
<v Speaker 1>I'm excited to be back here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're kicking ass digging wells.</v>

6
00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.760
<v Speaker 1>All of the above trying fights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you had now back in Beltour?</v>

7
00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:19.380
<v Speaker 1>Only a two to uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I haven't been back since the first</v>

8
00:00:19.381 --> 00:00:22.170
<v Speaker 1>or second one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is what you are.</v>

9
00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were here before your first one,</v>

10
00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.540
<v Speaker 1>which was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you had a long break for five years and</v>

11
00:00:30.541 --> 00:00:35.541
<v Speaker 1>two months and I hadn't even really</v>
<v Speaker 1>trained any at that point.</v>

12
00:00:35.731 --> 00:00:39.480
<v Speaker 1>Like I was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just doing the wells and going to</v>

13
00:00:39.481 --> 00:00:42.930
<v Speaker 1>Congo and then uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>got back into fighting and only had a</v>

14
00:00:42.931 --> 00:00:44.010
<v Speaker 1>little bit of time to train,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

15
00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:45.210
<v Speaker 1>it was uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was okay.</v>

16
00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.010
<v Speaker 1>But this time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you have it for your first fight?</v>

17
00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:50.370
<v Speaker 1>I think actually whenever I was here</v>
<v Speaker 1>with you,</v>

18
00:00:50.371 --> 00:00:51.400
<v Speaker 1>I uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

19
00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.520
<v Speaker 1>I fibbed a little where I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

20
00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.480
<v Speaker 1>it was a little longer because I didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>know if my opponent was going to watch</v>

21
00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:58.050
<v Speaker 1>her or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

22
00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.780
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my fight camp got cut in half.</v>

23
00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:02.700
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was traveling,</v>

24
00:01:02.701 --> 00:01:03.390
<v Speaker 1>traveling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>traveling,</v>

25
00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.790
<v Speaker 1>the book was getting ready to come out</v>
<v Speaker 1>and other stuff and try and write the</v>

26
00:01:05.791 --> 00:01:09.840
<v Speaker 1>book and prepare and trying to figure</v>
<v Speaker 1>all that out where were just talking</v>

27
00:01:09.841 --> 00:01:12.670
<v Speaker 1>before we got on and about just life</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff and scheduling it and everything</v>

28
00:01:12.671 --> 00:01:16.890
<v Speaker 1>and they had the book and then Congo and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then telling people about it and then</v>

29
00:01:16.891 --> 00:01:20.340
<v Speaker 1>also training for a fight and I didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>know how to balance those real well.</v>

30
00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:20.631
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

31
00:01:20.631 --> 00:01:22.490
<v Speaker 1>I play in 12 weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden,</v>

32
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.950
<v Speaker 1>Congo corruption took me to Congo for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for three weeks at the beginning,</v>

33
00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.860
<v Speaker 1>so we cut it down to nine weeks and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>whenever I got back or while I was</v>

34
00:01:28.861 --> 00:01:30.510
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I found out they were moving the fight</v>

35
00:01:30.511 --> 00:01:32.070
<v Speaker 1>up on me three weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

36
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.860
<v Speaker 1>and so it cut my camp down to about six,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven weeks.</v>

37
00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.070
<v Speaker 1>So six,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven weeks after being off for more</v>

38
00:01:38.071 --> 00:01:39.210
<v Speaker 1>than five years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

39
00:01:39.211 --> 00:01:42.000
<v Speaker 1>And I had trained a few times before</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

40
00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.720
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean like within the few months</v>

41
00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:46.553
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>

42
00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.280
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was probably tops two months,</v>

43
00:01:50.281 --> 00:01:52.830
<v Speaker 1>a nine weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll pause.</v>

44
00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.050
<v Speaker 1>Weren't you just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just getting over malaria?</v>

45
00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.153
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I was,</v>

46
00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.010
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

47
00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:01.710
<v Speaker 1>that's the tough stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a tougher in the fight.</v>

48
00:02:01.711 --> 00:02:03.450
<v Speaker 1>I feel like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck man,</v>

49
00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.420
<v Speaker 1>we have one of our guys in Congress</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's got,</v>

50
00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.610
<v Speaker 1>had malaria,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of our jewelers I just recently got</v>

51
00:02:08.611 --> 00:02:11.120
<v Speaker 1>real sick and it's kind of like</v>
<v Speaker 1>constantly,</v>

52
00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.980
<v Speaker 1>it's just part of life there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus.</v>

53
00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:16.440
<v Speaker 1>And it doesn't matter what kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>medication you take before you go out</v>

54
00:02:16.441 --> 00:02:18.140
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was actually taking a.</v>

55
00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:20.460
<v Speaker 1>actually our director at water four was</v>
<v Speaker 1>taking,</v>

56
00:02:20.461 --> 00:02:22.140
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>malarone.</v>

57
00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.200
<v Speaker 1>It's like the best anti-malaria pill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's something like seven,</v>

58
00:02:25.201 --> 00:02:26.490
<v Speaker 1>$8 every pill.</v>

59
00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:27.510
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

60
00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.840
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the creme de la creme of Larry meds</v>

61
00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.900
<v Speaker 1>and it didn't work on him and I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually going into Congo actually.</v>

62
00:02:36.751 --> 00:02:39.690
<v Speaker 1>I stopped in London,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did one of those Ted talks at a</v>

63
00:02:39.691 --> 00:02:44.691
<v Speaker 1>university called Warwick University.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the day of the talk I was at a 100,</v>

64
00:02:45.631 --> 00:02:48.420
<v Speaker 1>three degree temperature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one to three point two.</v>

65
00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.060
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I thought it was pulling out.</v>

66
00:02:51.061 --> 00:02:54.080
<v Speaker 1>They thought it was pulling out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were at the hospital for four or</v>

67
00:02:54.081 --> 00:02:55.020
<v Speaker 1>five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>six hours.</v>

68
00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:56.460
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

69
00:02:56.461 --> 00:02:58.920
<v Speaker 1>and dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even the opportunity to go speak at that</v>

70
00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:02.020
<v Speaker 1>is because their team was all fans of</v>
<v Speaker 1>jre.</v>

71
00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:03.160
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

72
00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:04.180
<v Speaker 1>That's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

73
00:03:04.181 --> 00:03:06.160
<v Speaker 1>that was the opportunity gap because of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of this.</v>

74
00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:08.230
<v Speaker 1>And man it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

75
00:03:08.231 --> 00:03:10.120
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was tough during the talk.</v>

76
00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:11.380
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

77
00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:15.880
<v Speaker 1>whenever I got into Congo they told me I</v>
<v Speaker 1>had the flu in London and the doctors</v>

78
00:03:15.881 --> 00:03:18.130
<v Speaker 1>there and that's what I feel like here</v>
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

79
00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.120
<v Speaker 1>There can be tropical medical medicine</v>
<v Speaker 1>specialist here and they're probably</v>

80
00:03:22.121 --> 00:03:25.330
<v Speaker 1>really great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I would trust a doctor that's lived</v>

81
00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:27.460
<v Speaker 1>in the climate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the tropical climate around malaria that</v>

82
00:03:27.461 --> 00:03:29.710
<v Speaker 1>seen it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that knows all the symptoms,</v>

83
00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:32.260
<v Speaker 1>well knows to look for it because no one</v>
<v Speaker 1>gets it over here.</v>

84
00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:34.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so whenever I got into Congo,</v>

85
00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:35.890
<v Speaker 1>I flew from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

86
00:03:35.891 --> 00:03:40.750
<v Speaker 1>from work to Congo in whenever I landed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of going straight to the forest,</v>

87
00:03:40.751 --> 00:03:43.500
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they took me to like a air strip at a</v>

88
00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:46.210
<v Speaker 1>hospital in the middle of nowhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

89
00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:48.940
<v Speaker 1>so I landed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>went straight to the hospital and then</v>

90
00:03:48.941 --> 00:03:50.320
<v Speaker 1>right there they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have the flu,</v>

91
00:03:50.321 --> 00:03:51.520
<v Speaker 1>you have malaria.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

92
00:03:51.521 --> 00:03:52.660
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been,</v>

93
00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.340
<v Speaker 1>I've been in the states,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just fought and then I have a in</v>

94
00:03:57.341 --> 00:03:59.590
<v Speaker 1>Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's no normal area really</v>

95
00:03:59.591 --> 00:04:01.630
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was because it's still living</v>

96
00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:02.230
<v Speaker 1>inside me.</v>

97
00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:03.063
<v Speaker 1>There's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

98
00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:05.440
<v Speaker 1>I think there's three strands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One live in your body for three years,</v>

99
00:04:05.441 --> 00:04:08.200
<v Speaker 1>five years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the other is like 30 to life or</v>

100
00:04:08.201 --> 00:04:09.770
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

101
00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:11.720
<v Speaker 1>And so it just comes back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

102
00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.080
<v Speaker 1>it can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when your body's really rundown,</v>

103
00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:16.210
<v Speaker 1>when you're really tired,</v>
<v Speaker 1>immune system's low,</v>

104
00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:19.810
<v Speaker 1>like training for a fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like training for a fight or right after</v>

105
00:04:19.811 --> 00:04:20.620
<v Speaker 1>the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

106
00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:21.850
<v Speaker 1>right off the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Went to London,</v>

107
00:04:21.851 --> 00:04:23.260
<v Speaker 1>spoke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I went to Congo.</v>

108
00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:27.640
<v Speaker 1>But right after the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you were recovering from malaria.</v>

109
00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:30.550
<v Speaker 1>You go through your six week fight camp,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have your fight,</v>

110
00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:33.040
<v Speaker 1>your rundown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then after the fight you got malaria</v>

111
00:04:33.041 --> 00:04:34.360
<v Speaker 1>again?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

112
00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:39.100
<v Speaker 1>Now the sickness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had it now three times.</v>

113
00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.560
<v Speaker 1>Oh my kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So at least confirmed twice.</v>

114
00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:43.150
<v Speaker 1>The third time they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

115
00:04:43.151 --> 00:04:44.310
<v Speaker 1>you have it for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they,</v>

116
00:04:44.311 --> 00:04:48.340
<v Speaker 1>you with malaria,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to get the test,</v>

117
00:04:48.341 --> 00:04:50.770
<v Speaker 1>the blood test while you have a certain</v>
<v Speaker 1>degree,</v>

118
00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:52.640
<v Speaker 1>temperature fever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

119
00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:55.360
<v Speaker 1>whenever it's cycling out of your liver</v>
<v Speaker 1>and coming out,</v>

120
00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:58.420
<v Speaker 1>they have to draw the blood at that</v>
<v Speaker 1>exact time to get it.</v>

121
00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:02.800
<v Speaker 1>And so that's why I was misdiagnosed</v>
<v Speaker 1>four times in the Congo and um,</v>

122
00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:04.760
<v Speaker 1>what a sneaky fucking disease.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

123
00:05:04.761 --> 00:05:06.250
<v Speaker 1>it's nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy because they'll,</v>

124
00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:09.110
<v Speaker 1>they'll hide in your liver and then they</v>
<v Speaker 1>send them out in your bloodstream,</v>

125
00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:10.480
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a platoon.</v>

126
00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:13.840
<v Speaker 1>They go and wreck havoc and then they</v>
<v Speaker 1>retreat right back to the liver.</v>

127
00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:16.060
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They live in your liver?</v>

128
00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:17.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where they're hiding away for</v>

129
00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:20.950
<v Speaker 1>three or five or 30 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

130
00:05:20.951 --> 00:05:22.780
<v Speaker 1>And what does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there any solution?</v>

131
00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:24.300
<v Speaker 1>Is there anything they could do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

132
00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:27.430
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I had a couple of things that</v>

133
00:05:27.431 --> 00:05:29.050
<v Speaker 1>happened where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

134
00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:31.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started trying to take the anti</v>

135
00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:33.070
<v Speaker 1>malaria meds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I started getting,</v>

136
00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.370
<v Speaker 1>it's the only medicine I've ever really</v>
<v Speaker 1>reacted to where get nauseous,</v>

137
00:05:36.371 --> 00:05:37.840
<v Speaker 1>start dragging it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's awful.</v>

138
00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:38.531
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even,</v>

139
00:05:38.531 --> 00:05:39.820
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even um,</v>

140
00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:43.060
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm pasty white and I get real sun</v>

141
00:05:43.061 --> 00:05:43.894
<v Speaker 1>sensitive.</v>

142
00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:46.300
<v Speaker 1>I know another medicine called</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible],</v>

143
00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:50.230
<v Speaker 1>which is a think it's developed in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Switzerland or Sweden,</v>

144
00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:53.020
<v Speaker 1>supposed to be an awesome new malaria</v>
<v Speaker 1>medicine.</v>

145
00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:55.600
<v Speaker 1>It's actually the one thing my body kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of responds to,</v>

146
00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:58.430
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's actually really dangerous</v>

147
00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:00.950
<v Speaker 1>because a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen people that are there for aid</v>

148
00:06:00.951 --> 00:06:03.200
<v Speaker 1>work and different stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And do they have to,</v>

149
00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.570
<v Speaker 1>they have to retreat if they're there</v>
<v Speaker 1>with kids and stuff.</v>

150
00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:08.630
<v Speaker 1>They moved there to the country they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>taking off because um,</v>

151
00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:13.970
<v Speaker 1>cause kiddos or even adults have mental</v>
<v Speaker 1>breaks that they can't come back from.</v>

152
00:06:13.971 --> 00:06:15.980
<v Speaker 1>Like you can have psychotic episodes</v>
<v Speaker 1>for.</v>

153
00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:18.620
<v Speaker 1>I think they said like if it lasts</v>
<v Speaker 1>longer than a week,</v>

154
00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:20.690
<v Speaker 1>it's probably in the last like three</v>
<v Speaker 1>months.</v>

155
00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:23.270
<v Speaker 1>It will last longer than three months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's probably the last forever.</v>

156
00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:24.610
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

157
00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:25.191
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

158
00:06:25.191 --> 00:06:26.660
<v Speaker 1>so this is from the medication?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

159
00:06:26.661 --> 00:06:28.640
<v Speaker 1>it's just the medication and it gives</v>
<v Speaker 1>you terrible,</v>

160
00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:29.960
<v Speaker 1>terrible nightmares.</v>

161
00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:34.910
<v Speaker 1>I almost went to Tanzania this summer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was going to go on Safari?</v>

162
00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:38.180
<v Speaker 1>And too many people scare the shit out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of me with malaria talk.</v>

163
00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:40.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was going to take my whole family and</v>

164
00:06:40.251 --> 00:06:40.701
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

165
00:06:40.701 --> 00:06:43.100
<v Speaker 1>I'll take some millennial malaria</v>
<v Speaker 1>medication and feel like shit,</v>

166
00:06:43.101 --> 00:06:46.220
<v Speaker 1>I'm not giving it to my six year old is</v>
<v Speaker 1>not happening.</v>

167
00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:47.900
<v Speaker 1>That would be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not doing enough when you.</v>

168
00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:50.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's a real concern.</v>

169
00:06:50.061 --> 00:06:51.740
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tanzania has malaria as well,</v>

170
00:06:51.741 --> 00:06:52.431
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

171
00:06:52.431 --> 00:06:57.260
<v Speaker 1>they do it because it's more of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an arid climate and we're,</v>

172
00:06:57.850 --> 00:06:59.840
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have less there.</v>

173
00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:02.750
<v Speaker 1>It's not so tropical there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been to Tennessee a couple times</v>

174
00:07:02.751 --> 00:07:05.240
<v Speaker 1>and seeing the bar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's just um,</v>

175
00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:08.330
<v Speaker 1>I met wasn't there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I was saw it and it was a,</v>

176
00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:09.980
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

177
00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:11.180
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a crazy,</v>

178
00:07:11.181 --> 00:07:15.440
<v Speaker 1>crazy place because you go from Congo</v>
<v Speaker 1>where they have all these tropical</v>

179
00:07:15.441 --> 00:07:19.040
<v Speaker 1>diseases and you go same continent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just go over a little bit and</v>

180
00:07:19.041 --> 00:07:22.310
<v Speaker 1>there's all these other kinds of</v>
<v Speaker 1>parasites in Congo there you have very</v>

181
00:07:22.311 --> 00:07:27.230
<v Speaker 1>little of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe they're called jiggers with aj</v>

182
00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:30.470
<v Speaker 1>and I'm very careful when you say that</v>
<v Speaker 1>word,</v>

183
00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:34.370
<v Speaker 1>but jiggers with aj I'm wrong.</v>

184
00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:39.560
<v Speaker 1>It sounds like you should stop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're these crazy parasites at</v>

185
00:07:41.331 --> 00:07:45.230
<v Speaker 1>borough in your feet and especially kids</v>
<v Speaker 1>and elderly.</v>

186
00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:48.110
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and especially kids and elderly.</v>

187
00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:50.270
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well honestly,</v>

188
00:07:50.271 --> 00:07:54.230
<v Speaker 1>I think one reason with poverty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the kids don't get shoes until they can</v>

189
00:07:54.231 --> 00:07:56.330
<v Speaker 1>work in biome and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the elderly,</v>

190
00:07:56.510 --> 00:07:59.380
<v Speaker 1>if they're not able to work and provide</v>
<v Speaker 1>for themselves and you know,</v>

191
00:07:59.390 --> 00:08:00.750
<v Speaker 1>it's harder for them to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

192
00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:04.250
<v Speaker 1>to get shoes and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also it's just where they live</v>

193
00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:09.790
<v Speaker 1>because on the sandy or it's either</v>
<v Speaker 1>sandy or the clash or silty soil that's</v>

194
00:08:10.191 --> 00:08:12.170
<v Speaker 1>real red and Uganda,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

195
00:08:12.171 --> 00:08:14.810
<v Speaker 1>It just wreaks havoc on those kids to</v>
<v Speaker 1>where they're having to have people come</v>

196
00:08:14.811 --> 00:08:19.811
<v Speaker 1>in every week to different villages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sit there with a safety pins and all</v>

197
00:08:20.241 --> 00:08:22.820
<v Speaker 1>sorts of these little hooks that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>dig into people's feeds.</v>

198
00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:24.620
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh God,</v>

199
00:08:24.621 --> 00:08:25.040
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

200
00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:27.260
<v Speaker 1>it's painful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whenever I've seen people getting it</v>

201
00:08:27.261 --> 00:08:28.940
<v Speaker 1>done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're literally putting their.</v>

202
00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.240
<v Speaker 1>And I've had one in my foot and it kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of came and gone.</v>

203
00:08:32.530 --> 00:08:35.990
<v Speaker 1>It's not that bad when it's just one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but whenever your whole foot or your</v>

204
00:08:35.991 --> 00:08:37.860
<v Speaker 1>whole heel or all the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

205
00:08:37.861 --> 00:08:40.490
<v Speaker 1>the balls of your feet are just covered</v>
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>

206
00:08:40.810 --> 00:08:41.660
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking 20,</v>

207
00:08:41.661 --> 00:08:42.291
<v Speaker 1>30,</v>
<v Speaker 1>40,</v>

208
00:08:42.291 --> 00:08:45.560
<v Speaker 1>50 of these parasites.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just brutal.</v>

209
00:08:45.561 --> 00:08:48.380
<v Speaker 1>So every step you see them when they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>walking,</v>

210
00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:50.090
<v Speaker 1>they're grimacing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you're taking it out there</v>

211
00:08:50.091 --> 00:08:53.510
<v Speaker 1>screaming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God Damn Africa.</v>

212
00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.190
<v Speaker 1>Africa is just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's such a strange,</v>

213
00:08:56.191 --> 00:08:59.990
<v Speaker 1>strange continent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but me and the people are,</v>

214
00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:02.310
<v Speaker 1>are beautiful in their hearts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

215
00:09:02.311 --> 00:09:06.120
<v Speaker 1>they're awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're a half her probably more than</v>

216
00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:07.410
<v Speaker 1>half.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're not a good one,</v>

217
00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:09.540
<v Speaker 1>you're very terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

218
00:09:09.541 --> 00:09:13.380
<v Speaker 1>that's simple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously from the outside,</v>

219
00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:15.960
<v Speaker 1>that's what it looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone like me who tries to pay</v>

220
00:09:15.961 --> 00:09:19.860
<v Speaker 1>attention as much as I can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's only so much you could</v>

221
00:09:19.861 --> 00:09:21.210
<v Speaker 1>actually know about it without being</v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

222
00:09:21.211 --> 00:09:22.044
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

223
00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:23.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>

224
00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:27.540
<v Speaker 1>I think whenever you get there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

225
00:09:27.541 --> 00:09:30.870
<v Speaker 1>fall in love with the people and to</v>
<v Speaker 1>build up the relationships.</v>

226
00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:35.220
<v Speaker 1>That's why you can see past all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>garbage,</v>

227
00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:39.330
<v Speaker 1>all the discomfort.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You said that you were held up with</v>

228
00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:41.340
<v Speaker 1>corruption,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Congo corruption.</v>

229
00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:42.930
<v Speaker 1>What happened?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they,</v>

230
00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:44.730
<v Speaker 1>they called me and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

231
00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:45.953
<v Speaker 1>my team,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

232
00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:48.900
<v Speaker 1>is Astrid Papa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Papa y is like a father figure to me.</v>

233
00:09:48.930 --> 00:09:51.960
<v Speaker 1>He's the one that had this vision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I came alongside him and it's just been,</v>

234
00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:55.440
<v Speaker 1>it's been awesome to see what's happened</v>
<v Speaker 1>in um,</v>

235
00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:58.860
<v Speaker 1>whenever I went to him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually.</v>

236
00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:00.570
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was the question?</v>

237
00:10:00.571 --> 00:10:03.590
<v Speaker 1>You're just asking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even remember what I say.</v>

238
00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:06.300
<v Speaker 1>I said about the corruption corruption</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

239
00:10:06.301 --> 00:10:06.841
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

240
00:10:06.841 --> 00:10:10.650
<v Speaker 1>He called me and said a fat you to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>back here and like three weeks and I'm</v>

241
00:10:10.651 --> 00:10:11.520
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

242
00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:14.700
<v Speaker 1>I'm training for the fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's coming up and I can't leave.</v>

243
00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:16.080
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he says if you don't come back.</v>

244
00:10:16.081 --> 00:10:18.420
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't know when you can come</v>

245
00:10:18.421 --> 00:10:19.110
<v Speaker 1>back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll,</v>

246
00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:22.290
<v Speaker 1>they're going to revoke your visa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to.</v>

247
00:10:22.291 --> 00:10:23.460
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what for?</v>

248
00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:25.230
<v Speaker 1>And so they said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>check your passport.</v>

249
00:10:25.650 --> 00:10:27.990
<v Speaker 1>They said your visa is expiring in three</v>
<v Speaker 1>weeks.</v>

250
00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:29.760
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it should be expiring.</v>

251
00:10:29.761 --> 00:10:32.880
<v Speaker 1>I have a five year visa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then you have to come in and out of</v>

252
00:10:32.881 --> 00:10:34.830
<v Speaker 1>the country every 11 months because if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't,</v>

253
00:10:34.831 --> 00:10:39.360
<v Speaker 1>you lose that five year visa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so whenever I left with my wife,</v>

254
00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:44.390
<v Speaker 1>literally they just so that they can get</v>
<v Speaker 1>money out of us and steel and build,</v>

255
00:10:46.081 --> 00:10:50.550
<v Speaker 1>asked for 1400,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes $2,500 to get a visa like</v>

256
00:10:50.551 --> 00:10:51.800
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

257
00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:52.511
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

258
00:10:52.511 --> 00:10:54.470
<v Speaker 1>they write down on your visa when they</v>
<v Speaker 1>stamp it,</v>

259
00:10:54.710 --> 00:10:57.210
<v Speaker 1>the date they write it in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so now I know,</v>

260
00:10:57.270 --> 00:10:59.640
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every single time they're writing to</v>

261
00:10:59.641 --> 00:11:03.510
<v Speaker 1>make sure they write the right date</v>
<v Speaker 1>because she backdated it like six months</v>

262
00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:06.360
<v Speaker 1>or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or maybe nine months and then all of a</v>

263
00:11:06.361 --> 00:11:08.010
<v Speaker 1>sudden I had to get back there because</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>

264
00:11:08.011 --> 00:11:08.970
<v Speaker 1>nope,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's gonna expire.</v>

265
00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:11.340
<v Speaker 1>And they thought they gave him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually it might've been less than</v>

266
00:11:11.341 --> 00:11:13.170
<v Speaker 1>three weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it had to go for three weeks is</v>

267
00:11:13.171 --> 00:11:16.530
<v Speaker 1>what happened because I like a week</v>
<v Speaker 1>notice I just took off when it's</v>

268
00:11:16.531 --> 00:11:19.090
<v Speaker 1>actually the cheapest trip I've ever got</v>
<v Speaker 1>there because it was like the last seat</v>

269
00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:21.180
<v Speaker 1>I was by the toilets in the back the</v>
<v Speaker 1>whole time.</v>

270
00:11:21.450 --> 00:11:24.770
<v Speaker 1>But there's only $800 round trip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was incredible.</v>

271
00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:27.570
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can go to Africa for 800 bucks.</v>

272
00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:28.433
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was,</v>

273
00:11:28.690 --> 00:11:31.650
<v Speaker 1>I never seen it like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was a good school.</v>

274
00:11:31.651 --> 00:11:35.780
<v Speaker 1>So I went and I mean it helped because</v>
<v Speaker 1>that saved me some money that was going</v>

275
00:11:35.781 --> 00:11:38.040
<v Speaker 1>to have to pay to try to get out of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>corruption and stuff.</v>

276
00:11:38.041 --> 00:11:41.750
<v Speaker 1>But luckily we went there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't think I would just dropping,</v>

277
00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:42.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be there in five,</v>

278
00:11:42.931 --> 00:11:43.764
<v Speaker 1>six,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven days.</v>

279
00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:47.970
<v Speaker 1>So I took off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>went and we spent three weeks trying to</v>

280
00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:50.730
<v Speaker 1>just negotiate with the courts and</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything else and say,</v>

281
00:11:50.731 --> 00:11:51.720
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

282
00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:53.950
<v Speaker 1>you guys did this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you sent me an up all this other stuff</v>

283
00:11:53.951 --> 00:11:55.840
<v Speaker 1>and trying to prove them wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're never wrong,</v>

284
00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:56.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're always right.</v>

285
00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:00.010
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to show them even receipts and</v>

286
00:12:00.011 --> 00:12:02.020
<v Speaker 1>pictures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were showing them pictures from Ben's</v>

287
00:12:02.021 --> 00:12:03.670
<v Speaker 1>wedding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like my best friend,</v>

288
00:12:03.671 --> 00:12:05.620
<v Speaker 1>like a brother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a translator for me.</v>

289
00:12:05.830 --> 00:12:09.460
<v Speaker 1>He's our team leader and I'm literally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're showing pictures of me at his</v>

290
00:12:09.461 --> 00:12:12.580
<v Speaker 1>wedding and luckily it was dated and</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything,</v>

291
00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:16.990
<v Speaker 1>like I was here in the country when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>said I had already left for five months</v>

292
00:12:17.290 --> 00:12:18.610
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

293
00:12:18.611 --> 00:12:19.291
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just not,</v>

294
00:12:19.291 --> 00:12:22.460
<v Speaker 1>it's like the backdating is intentional</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do it.</v>

295
00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:25.000
<v Speaker 1>I'll do it on purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that for me and my wife,</v>

296
00:12:25.001 --> 00:12:25.930
<v Speaker 1>both,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

297
00:12:25.931 --> 00:12:28.030
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they made it the same date which was</v>

298
00:12:28.031 --> 00:12:30.220
<v Speaker 1>like six months or eight months early.</v>

299
00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:32.890
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we left earlier than what we did.</v>

300
00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:35.500
<v Speaker 1>So from the outside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're visiting them,</v>

301
00:12:35.501 --> 00:12:37.230
<v Speaker 1>did they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do they think somehow or another that</v>

302
00:12:37.231 --> 00:12:40.870
<v Speaker 1>you're wealthy and that they can take</v>
<v Speaker 1>advantage of you?</v>

303
00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:42.730
<v Speaker 1>They know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they know you're on television,</v>

304
00:12:42.731 --> 00:12:43.970
<v Speaker 1>do they know all that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

305
00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:47.410
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we keep that really kind of when I'm,</v>

306
00:12:47.411 --> 00:12:50.560
<v Speaker 1>there I am a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me see if I can get the right.</v>

307
00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:54.400
<v Speaker 1>I am a professor of appropriate</v>
<v Speaker 1>technologies that appropriate</v>

308
00:12:54.401 --> 00:12:59.200
<v Speaker 1>technologies or like a community</v>
<v Speaker 1>development or sustainable solutions and</v>

309
00:12:59.201 --> 00:13:02.650
<v Speaker 1>I go there and I'm teaching the students</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the university how to,</v>

310
00:13:02.651 --> 00:13:05.260
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and only I only do like a week or two</v>

311
00:13:05.261 --> 00:13:07.930
<v Speaker 1>seminar with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The rest of them with my well drilling</v>

312
00:13:07.931 --> 00:13:11.700
<v Speaker 1>team and that's my covering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go there as a quote unquote a</v>

313
00:13:11.770 --> 00:13:13.990
<v Speaker 1>professor commission give that up on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Internet.</v>

314
00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:15.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm even people.</v>

315
00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:16.070
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

316
00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:16.901
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's okay.</v>

317
00:13:16.901 --> 00:13:19.630
<v Speaker 1>But I do that because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

318
00:13:19.631 --> 00:13:24.631
<v Speaker 1>when I go in and really it's not because</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm on TV or anything like that or they</v>

319
00:13:25.151 --> 00:13:27.670
<v Speaker 1>think I have money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just think anyone that's not</v>

320
00:13:27.671 --> 00:13:31.240
<v Speaker 1>Congolese has money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so because that's what they've seen</v>

321
00:13:31.270 --> 00:13:35.140
<v Speaker 1>from people coming in and throwing money</v>
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>

322
00:13:35.770 --> 00:13:37.060
<v Speaker 1>So they want their.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

323
00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:40.210
<v Speaker 1>in a lot of the ngos are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

324
00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:43.920
<v Speaker 1>they have quotas and everything else and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other just a huge budget and they</v>

325
00:13:43.921 --> 00:13:45.380
<v Speaker 1>got to spend it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They got to meet those,</v>

326
00:13:45.710 --> 00:13:48.460
<v Speaker 1>those quotas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So sometimes they throw it around and</v>

327
00:13:48.461 --> 00:13:51.010
<v Speaker 1>they're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not trying to be frugal with the</v>

328
00:13:51.011 --> 00:13:53.680
<v Speaker 1>money because it's not theirs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't go out and get it or</v>

329
00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:56.500
<v Speaker 1>fundraising or get a grant for it or</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything like that.</v>

330
00:13:56.530 --> 00:13:59.800
<v Speaker 1>It just got to spend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they'll just give it away.</v>

331
00:14:00.490 --> 00:14:03.300
<v Speaker 1>Do the people that live in the Congo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the,</v>

332
00:14:03.301 --> 00:14:05.020
<v Speaker 1>the pygmies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do they still get malaria?</v>

333
00:14:05.950 --> 00:14:08.410
<v Speaker 1>Is it really common with them yet?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're really common.</v>

334
00:14:09.250 --> 00:14:11.170
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

335
00:14:11.830 --> 00:14:12.670
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

336
00:14:13.750 --> 00:14:18.010
<v Speaker 1>it's weird because whenever people come,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess they're more acclimated to it,</v>

337
00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:20.520
<v Speaker 1>but it still kills so many.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

338
00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:22.840
<v Speaker 1>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but whenever I get it,</v>

339
00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:23.713
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're saying,</v>

340
00:14:23.770 --> 00:14:26.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the doctor here told me because of the</v>

341
00:14:26.141 --> 00:14:28.630
<v Speaker 1>malaria meds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would be better for you to go because</v>

342
00:14:28.631 --> 00:14:30.580
<v Speaker 1>you're already getting sick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>too sick with medicine,</v>

343
00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:35.380
<v Speaker 1>just go get malaria and then get it</v>
<v Speaker 1>diagnosed quick enough,</v>

344
00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:39.550
<v Speaker 1>get the cure and now your body's</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually gonna adapt to it and the next</v>

345
00:14:39.551 --> 00:14:40.950
<v Speaker 1>time you get it will be less and less</v>
<v Speaker 1>women.</v>

346
00:14:40.970 --> 00:14:45.910
<v Speaker 1>So they told you to get malaria.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking Christ one of the worst diseases</v>

347
00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:46.910
<v Speaker 1>person can get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

348
00:14:46.911 --> 00:14:48.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But honestly I've seen people,</v>

349
00:14:48.401 --> 00:14:51.590
<v Speaker 1>even even Ben Ben's nuts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the year that I was there,</v>

350
00:14:51.770 --> 00:14:55.490
<v Speaker 1>he had malaria,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now it's almost killed them before too,</v>

351
00:14:55.730 --> 00:14:58.520
<v Speaker 1>but he had malaria like three or four</v>
<v Speaker 1>times in a year.</v>

352
00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:01.520
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it just kind of really,</v>

353
00:15:01.521 --> 00:15:04.760
<v Speaker 1>really common there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But once you,</v>

354
00:15:04.850 --> 00:15:07.460
<v Speaker 1>if you can survive it the first couple</v>
<v Speaker 1>times,</v>

355
00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:10.910
<v Speaker 1>then they say after that it gets more</v>
<v Speaker 1>bearable because you feel it coming.</v>

356
00:15:10.911 --> 00:15:15.911
<v Speaker 1>You feel the heat waves coming over you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you fill the shoulder joint</v>

357
00:15:16.371 --> 00:15:20.450
<v Speaker 1>pains and elbows and it just down your</v>
<v Speaker 1>whole spine and your finger joints are</v>

358
00:15:20.451 --> 00:15:22.970
<v Speaker 1>just throbbing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you can feel your pulse.</v>

359
00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:25.670
<v Speaker 1>So it's an inflammation disease.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

360
00:15:25.671 --> 00:15:29.000
<v Speaker 1>it's a blood parasite disease and had</v>
<v Speaker 1>just a.</v>

361
00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:32.060
<v Speaker 1>But it causes some inflammation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The parasite somehow or another does</v>

362
00:15:32.061 --> 00:15:33.000
<v Speaker 1>that to your joints.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

363
00:15:33.070 --> 00:15:34.890
<v Speaker 1>And it released causes a lot of pain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that.</v>

364
00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:35.753
<v Speaker 1>And it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

365
00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:37.250
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

366
00:15:37.251 --> 00:15:39.290
<v Speaker 1>I lost 33 pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five days.</v>

367
00:15:39.530 --> 00:15:41.090
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ,</v>

368
00:15:41.091 --> 00:15:43.640
<v Speaker 1>33 pounds in five days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thirty three pounds.</v>

369
00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:47.780
<v Speaker 1>Dr Oz,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dr. Oz would sell that I could.</v>

370
00:15:47.810 --> 00:15:49.310
<v Speaker 1>I could be in here.</v>

371
00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:53.690
<v Speaker 1>I got a new,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a la diet for he can he really do the</v>

372
00:15:53.691 --> 00:15:55.470

<v Speaker 1>Really hot,</v>

373
00:15:56.350 --> 00:16:00.110
<v Speaker 1>too hot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's a massive sacrifice.</v>

374
00:16:00.111 --> 00:16:03.260
<v Speaker 1>You're willing to take time to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this,</v>

375
00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:07.070
<v Speaker 1>the fact that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it exists inside your body for an</v>

376
00:16:07.071 --> 00:16:09.590
<v Speaker 1>undetermined stated time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's um,</v>

377
00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:10.910
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty wild,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

378
00:16:11.350 --> 00:16:13.070
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's scary.</v>

379
00:16:14.930 --> 00:16:16.250
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

380
00:16:16.251 --> 00:16:19.040
<v Speaker 1>Honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I was in a much scarier</v>

381
00:16:19.041 --> 00:16:24.041
<v Speaker 1>place personally before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before I found this before I found them</v>

382
00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:29.920
<v Speaker 1>before I got given a second family or</v>
<v Speaker 1>accepted into a second family and even</v>

383
00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:35.700
<v Speaker 1>more scarier because you were depressed</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you just will depress suicidal</v>

384
00:16:36.261 --> 00:16:37.550
<v Speaker 1>thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had for like 10 years,</v>

385
00:16:37.610 --> 00:16:39.830
<v Speaker 1>just battled it from 13 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>23.</v>

386
00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:41.410
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

387
00:16:42.130 --> 00:16:42.963
<v Speaker 1>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

388
00:16:43.070 --> 00:16:47.450
<v Speaker 1>that was a lot scarier to me than</v>
<v Speaker 1>suicidal thoughts when you're 13.</v>

389
00:16:47.510 --> 00:16:48.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

390
00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:50.960
<v Speaker 1>And I mean I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was the one that like,</v>

391
00:16:50.990 --> 00:16:52.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the kid in the,</v>

392
00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:55.160
<v Speaker 1>in the class that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I wasn't,</v>

393
00:16:55.550 --> 00:16:56.750
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say I was,</v>

394
00:16:57.800 --> 00:16:58.633
<v Speaker 1>how do I say it?</v>

395
00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:02.190
<v Speaker 1>It was extremely brutal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was happening to.</v>

396
00:17:02.390 --> 00:17:04.160
<v Speaker 1>I mean everyone gets bullied for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>most part.</v>

397
00:17:04.820 --> 00:17:06.470
<v Speaker 1>Somebody is bullying you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

398
00:17:06.530 --> 00:17:08.030
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was growing up that from,</v>

399
00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:10.940
<v Speaker 1>from third grade until eighth grade for</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure,</v>

400
00:17:11.210 --> 00:17:14.240
<v Speaker 1>it was brutal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seventh and he throws me usually smaller</v>

401
00:17:14.241 --> 00:17:16.450
<v Speaker 1>than I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

402
00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:20.450
<v Speaker 1>I was smaller.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It takes a lot of balls to bully you and</v>

403
00:17:20.451 --> 00:17:22.670
<v Speaker 1>a backfire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's actually kind of why I found</v>

404
00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:26.280
<v Speaker 1>fighting or net,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why it is kind.</v>

405
00:17:26.430 --> 00:17:31.220
<v Speaker 1>It is because a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was 13 years old and I had just gotten</v>

406
00:17:31.460 --> 00:17:32.450
<v Speaker 1>so well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two things.</v>

407

<v Speaker 1>Have you ever seen in Texas for high</v>
<v Speaker 1>school homecomings?</v>

<v Speaker 1>Have you heard of that?</v>

00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:41.030
<v Speaker 1>Now it's a mom fixes tradition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

410
00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:42.673
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All,</v>

00:17:42.770 --> 00:17:44.120
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the kids love them.</v>

412
00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:47.930
<v Speaker 1>Everything else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you get these corsages or fake</v>

413
00:17:47.931 --> 00:17:52.470
<v Speaker 1>flowers that they put real big up top</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they are streamers with literal</v>

<v Speaker 1>bells and whistles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>full sized teddy bears.</v>

415
00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:57.420
<v Speaker 1>You can have two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three teddy bears and when I was in high</v>

416
00:17:57.421 --> 00:17:58.470
<v Speaker 1>school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the girl would wear it on her,</v>

<v Speaker 1>arm.</v>

418
00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:02.970

<v Speaker 1>they literally have to put a harness</v>

419
00:18:02.971 --> 00:18:06.000
<v Speaker 1>around him and hold these things up</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're so big and there you go.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

426
00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:23.760

00:19:09.541 --> 00:19:13.320
<v Speaker 1>clicked on every single grocery store in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Texas?</v>

448
00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:16.890
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whenever it comes to like a September,</v>

449
00:19:16.890 --> 00:19:17.431
<v Speaker 1>October,</v>
<v Speaker 1>November,</v>

450
00:19:17.431 --> 00:19:18.870
<v Speaker 1>around homecoming time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>high school.</v>

451
00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:21.900
<v Speaker 1>Like this is people's jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like seasonal jobs.</v>

00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:23.400
<v Speaker 1>He sit around and they take special</v>
<v Speaker 1>orders.</v>

453
00:19:23.401 --> 00:19:26.010
<v Speaker 1>They make them for you or they sound</v>
<v Speaker 1>where he can make them yourself.</v>

454
00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:29.010
<v Speaker 1>That's so strange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it?</v>

455
00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:30.640
<v Speaker 1>Nuts?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many is this?</v>

456
00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:34.710
<v Speaker 1>It always baffles me when I find out</v>
<v Speaker 1>about something for the very first time.</v>

457
00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:38.460
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why I'm so confused by it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would like to find out where the</v>

458
00:19:38.461 --> 00:19:39.294
<v Speaker 1>traditional,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

459
00:19:39.570 --> 00:19:42.570
<v Speaker 1>came from probably.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I mean people are just so ingrained</v>

460
00:19:42.990 --> 00:19:44.910
<v Speaker 1>in you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're texting that you have to get</v>

461
00:19:44.911 --> 00:19:46.050
<v Speaker 1>moms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

462
00:19:46.051 --> 00:19:47.790
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there any other students find out if</v>

463
00:19:47.791 --> 00:19:50.280
<v Speaker 1>other states except that I literally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oklahoma doesn't do it.</v>

464
00:19:50.281 --> 00:19:51.760
<v Speaker 1>Louisiana doesn't.</v>

482
00:20:46.411 --> 00:20:48.640
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know how many are doing this</v>
<v Speaker 1>back when I was in high school,</v>

483
00:20:48.641 --> 00:20:50.500
<v Speaker 1>but nowadays you really want to impress</v>

<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

486
00:20:56.291 --> 00:20:58.890
<v Speaker 1>this isn't even like a juke website</v>
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>

487
00:20:59.430 --> 00:21:01.850
<v Speaker 1>They're taking it serious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>real serious,</v>

488
00:21:01.851 --> 00:21:03.880
<v Speaker 1>strange [inaudible].</v>

489
00:21:04.990 --> 00:21:07.570
<v Speaker 1>It's really weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so when I was in middle school,</v>

490
00:21:07.571 --> 00:21:09.090
<v Speaker 1>seventh grade,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I</v>

491
00:21:10.980 --> 00:21:14.140
<v Speaker 1>got a Christmas tree on her tits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's ridiculous.</v>

492
00:21:15.910 --> 00:21:17.400
<v Speaker 1>They uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

493
00:21:17.540 --> 00:21:21.280
<v Speaker 1>so you want to save?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saved it up and my allowance asked one</v>

494
00:21:21.281 --> 00:21:23.980
<v Speaker 1>of my crushes to go to the homecoming</v>
<v Speaker 1>game with me.</v>

495
00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:27.220
<v Speaker 1>She said yes to my surprise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>went to the game and uh,</v>

496
00:21:27.310 --> 00:21:31.700
<v Speaker 1>spent pretty much all my allowance on a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the her mom and uh,</v>

497
00:21:31.870 --> 00:21:36.080
<v Speaker 1>her name's Jessica and I took her to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>game and uh,</v>

498
00:21:36.190 --> 00:21:40.600
<v Speaker 1>I'm up in the stands with her and home</v>
<v Speaker 1>or halftime comes around.</v>

499
00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:45.100
<v Speaker 1>I'm up to the very top left and all of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>sudden everyone looks back up over the</v>

500
00:21:45.101 --> 00:21:48.670
<v Speaker 1>right shoulders at us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this one guy,</v>

501
00:21:48.671 --> 00:21:53.260
<v Speaker 1>he was Kinda my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my belief through elementary and middle</v>

502
00:21:53.261 --> 00:21:55.240
<v Speaker 1>school for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

503
00:21:55.330 --> 00:22:00.220
<v Speaker 1>his name was justin as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so he walks up and puts his arm out</v>

504
00:22:01.030 --> 00:22:04.510
<v Speaker 1>to her and she puts her arm around his</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he grabs the streamer that says,</v>

505
00:22:04.511 --> 00:22:07.390
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Justin and Jessica and the year on it or</v>

506
00:22:07.391 --> 00:22:07.900
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

507
00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:08.830
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he says,</v>

508
00:22:08.980 --> 00:22:10.480
<v Speaker 1>thanks for getting her this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

509
00:22:10.481 --> 00:22:11.081
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>

510
00:22:11.081 --> 00:22:12.250
<v Speaker 1>you didn't think she'd come with you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did you?</v>

511
00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:14.640
<v Speaker 1>And so he just kind of walks down all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the schools looking.</v>

512
00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:17.620
<v Speaker 1>They're all laughing and having fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

513
00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:18.910
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that one hurt,</v>

514
00:22:18.911 --> 00:22:20.770
<v Speaker 1>but what was worse with the next year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>

515
00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:23.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people liked that part of,</v>

516
00:22:24.250 --> 00:22:25.083
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think</v>

517
00:22:26.710 --> 00:22:28.450
<v Speaker 1>for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I see bullying now,</v>

518
00:22:28.510 --> 00:22:32.830
<v Speaker 1>I just spoke at a middle school and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>told one of the teachers asked,</v>

519
00:22:32.980 --> 00:22:37.150
<v Speaker 1>what should you tell a kid that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>battling with suicidal thoughts or</v>

520
00:22:37.151 --> 00:22:39.970
<v Speaker 1>depression even,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe suicidal thoughts.</v>

521
00:22:40.450 --> 00:22:41.283
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

522
00:22:41.350 --> 00:22:43.210
<v Speaker 1>if this is 300,</v>
<v Speaker 1>400 kids in here,</v>

523
00:22:43.270 --> 00:22:47.710
<v Speaker 1>like for sure one person is dealing with</v>
<v Speaker 1>these issues right now.</v>

524
00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:49.690
<v Speaker 1>And I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

525
00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:54.310
<v Speaker 1>the thing that probably saved me was my</v>
<v Speaker 1>parents didn't own a gun.</v>

526
00:22:54.390 --> 00:22:56.530
<v Speaker 1>I'd probably only Texans that don't own</v>
<v Speaker 1>guns.</v>

527
00:22:56.830 --> 00:22:57.670
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then,</v>

528
00:22:57.671 --> 00:22:59.330
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

529
00:22:59.350 --> 00:23:04.350
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess one of the main things was um,</v>

530
00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:09.100
<v Speaker 1>well I don't even know that I've ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>said this publicly,</v>

531
00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:10.200
<v Speaker 1>but I remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

532
00:23:11.170 --> 00:23:16.170
<v Speaker 1>having attempted suicide once and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking about it again and then I'm</v>

533
00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:17.500
<v Speaker 1>thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

534
00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:19.960
<v Speaker 1>what would this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would the student,</v>

535
00:23:19.961 --> 00:23:20.890
<v Speaker 1>my mom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

536
00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:23.260
<v Speaker 1>And so I love my mom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a mama's boy.</v>

537
00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:25.360
<v Speaker 1>Dad's great too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's just who I am.</v>

538
00:23:25.361 --> 00:23:28.600
<v Speaker 1>She's a tough cookie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's where I got my competitiveness.</v>

539
00:23:28.601 --> 00:23:30.910
<v Speaker 1>She was a national champion in barrel</v>
<v Speaker 1>racing,</v>

540
00:23:30.911 --> 00:23:33.490
<v Speaker 1>state champion in tennis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so she always pushed me,</v>

541
00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:34.720
<v Speaker 1>my dad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if he,</v>

542
00:23:34.721 --> 00:23:36.610
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if he was at a wrestling tournament and</v>

543
00:23:36.611 --> 00:23:39.850
<v Speaker 1>it's the finals even state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would dislocate my thumb or something</v>

544
00:23:39.851 --> 00:23:41.500
<v Speaker 1>to come up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to wrestle in the next</v>

545
00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:41.540
<v Speaker 1>match.</v>

546
00:23:41.540 --> 00:23:42.760
<v Speaker 1>Like it's the finals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My Mom's like,</v>

547
00:23:42.761 --> 00:23:44.290
<v Speaker 1>he's getting out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So my mom,</v>

548
00:23:44.291 --> 00:23:45.440
<v Speaker 1>mom's the one pushing him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shut up,</v>

549
00:23:45.441 --> 00:23:47.750
<v Speaker 1>Jimmy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's going gonna he's going to go out</v>

550
00:23:47.751 --> 00:23:49.160
<v Speaker 1>there and he's going to wrestle him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's going to win.</v>

551
00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:53.320
<v Speaker 1>And so my dad was more of one wanting to</v>
<v Speaker 1>protect me and she's the one who pushed</v>

552
00:23:53.330 --> 00:23:54.990
<v Speaker 1>me out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

553
00:23:55.490 --> 00:23:56.910
<v Speaker 1>so I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

554
00:23:57.520 --> 00:23:58.850
<v Speaker 1>saying that except for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

555
00:23:58.851 --> 00:24:01.820
<v Speaker 1>that thought was just ringing in my</v>
<v Speaker 1>head.</v>

556
00:24:01.821 --> 00:24:05.480
<v Speaker 1>And so whenever I finally verbalized</v>
<v Speaker 1>that and start talking to people,</v>

557
00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:07.160
<v Speaker 1>that's what really helped,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

558
00:24:07.190 --> 00:24:09.730
<v Speaker 1>it didn't have to be a bunch of people</v>
<v Speaker 1>that didn't have to go around and be,</v>

559
00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:11.350
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

560
00:24:11.780 --> 00:24:14.120
<v Speaker 1>a drama queen or do it for attention or</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

561
00:24:14.121 --> 00:24:19.121
<v Speaker 1>but just find one person and for me at</v>
<v Speaker 1>that age it was having a great mom and</v>

562
00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:22.730
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>parents that loved me and I think that's</v>

563
00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:26.000
<v Speaker 1>probably absolutely what saved me at</v>
<v Speaker 1>that time.</v>

564
00:24:26.050 --> 00:24:27.500
<v Speaker 1>And so I was telling these kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

565
00:24:27.501 --> 00:24:29.330
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell if even if it's just your mom.</v>

566
00:24:29.660 --> 00:24:31.900
<v Speaker 1>So I was taking pictures with some of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the kids afterwards and stuff and I'll</v>

567
00:24:31.910 --> 00:24:36.770
<v Speaker 1>walk out to leave and I'm in the hall in</v>
<v Speaker 1>this mom stops me because she's with her</v>

568
00:24:36.771 --> 00:24:39.860
<v Speaker 1>little guy and he's crying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a mom had come to school.</v>

569
00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:41.660
<v Speaker 1>I had heard there was anti anti-bullying</v>
<v Speaker 1>doc.</v>

570
00:24:42.230 --> 00:24:45.290
<v Speaker 1>She came up and I see this little guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he reminded me,</v>

571
00:24:45.291 --> 00:24:46.940
<v Speaker 1>a lot of me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only difference was,</v>

572
00:24:46.941 --> 00:24:49.670
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was he had these kind of big glasses on,</v>

573
00:24:49.671 --> 00:24:54.671
<v Speaker 1>but he was a little chubby and had just</v>
<v Speaker 1>had one of those things that you'd see</v>

574
00:24:54.741 --> 00:24:57.080
<v Speaker 1>stereotypical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like this kid's going to get picked on.</v>

575
00:24:57.590 --> 00:25:02.590
<v Speaker 1>And so I'm probably a lot like me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's used to getting his fat pinch tune,</v>

576
00:25:02.870 --> 00:25:05.780
<v Speaker 1>nipples twisted and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all that different stuff.</v>

577
00:25:05.780 --> 00:25:07.180
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

578
00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:09.830
<v Speaker 1>he was out there just balling with his</v>
<v Speaker 1>mom.</v>

579
00:25:09.890 --> 00:25:11.600
<v Speaker 1>His mom asked if I can talk to him for a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit.</v>

580
00:25:11.601 --> 00:25:16.601
<v Speaker 1>I did and she was saying that he had</v>
<v Speaker 1>never opened up with her and uh,</v>

581
00:25:17.090 --> 00:25:19.220
<v Speaker 1>in the last two years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she knew he had been dealing with</v>

582
00:25:19.340 --> 00:25:21.710
<v Speaker 1>really bad depression and right there he</v>
<v Speaker 1>told her,</v>

583
00:25:21.770 --> 00:25:23.720
<v Speaker 1>I've been dealing with suicidal thoughts</v>
<v Speaker 1>for two years.</v>

584
00:25:24.290 --> 00:25:27.460
<v Speaker 1>And so I don't know why I even brought</v>
<v Speaker 1>that up except for like,</v>

585
00:25:27.470 --> 00:25:28.620
<v Speaker 1>it's nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My parents have a,</v>

586
00:25:28.710 --> 00:25:33.710
<v Speaker 1>have a photography company and they made</v>
<v Speaker 1>a memorial a few years back for a little</v>

587
00:25:33.861 --> 00:25:38.420
<v Speaker 1>boy who was getting bullied.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Didn't think he had an option out and he</v>

588
00:25:38.421 --> 00:25:41.190
<v Speaker 1>took his life at nine years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my goodness.</v>

589
00:25:41.270 --> 00:25:43.520
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was a swing set out back.</v>

590
00:25:44.090 --> 00:25:47.240
<v Speaker 1>So I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh Jesus Christ.</v>

591
00:25:47.630 --> 00:25:48.650
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

592
00:25:49.010 --> 00:25:53.000
<v Speaker 1>I saw the plaque and everything made up</v>
<v Speaker 1>for them and just gut wrenching.</v>

593
00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:58.120
<v Speaker 1>And so as I say that in the first story</v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't kind of one that kind of brought</v>

594
00:25:59.091 --> 00:26:03.650
<v Speaker 1>everything to a head was I was in middle</v>
<v Speaker 1>eighth grade this time,</v>

595
00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:08.180
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>got invited to a Jennifer's birthday</v>

596
00:26:08.181 --> 00:26:10.220
<v Speaker 1>party.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really excited.</v>

597
00:26:10.221 --> 00:26:12.920
<v Speaker 1>I got one of the real limitations in my</v>
<v Speaker 1>hands and</v>

598
00:26:14.510 --> 00:26:17.150
<v Speaker 1>made the plans talk to my mom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>asked if I could go talk to some of the</v>

599
00:26:17.151 --> 00:26:20.240
<v Speaker 1>people who else is going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was just kind of a Dorky kid</v>

600
00:26:20.241 --> 00:26:21.074
<v Speaker 1>anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

601
00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:22.520
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

602
00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:24.320
<v Speaker 1>on the invitation I noticed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

603
00:26:24.321 --> 00:26:27.050
<v Speaker 1>it says costume contest and the winner</v>
<v Speaker 1>gets a prize.</v>

604
00:26:27.590 --> 00:26:29.150
<v Speaker 1>Why certain research,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all this other stuff,</v>

605
00:26:29.151 --> 00:26:31.020
<v Speaker 1>other people are doing it too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

606
00:26:31.130 --> 00:26:36.130
<v Speaker 1>I found out that her dad worked at Dr</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pepper in that their house was decorated</v>

607
00:26:36.261 --> 00:26:38.000
<v Speaker 1>with all this other stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

608
00:26:38.001 --> 00:26:40.430
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then she loved transformers.</v>

609
00:26:40.910 --> 00:26:43.860
<v Speaker 1>And so I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what if I combine two things,</v>

610
00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:48.270
<v Speaker 1>what if I could meet myself a cardboard</v>
<v Speaker 1>transformer from head to toe?</v>

611
00:26:49.060 --> 00:26:52.350
<v Speaker 1>I think it was a 24 pack or only had 12</v>
<v Speaker 1>packs around the arms,</v>

612
00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:54.270
<v Speaker 1>legs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boots I had.</v>

613
00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:57.600
<v Speaker 1>I had a chest plate at a sword out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>cardboard,</v>

614
00:26:57.601 --> 00:27:01.230
<v Speaker 1>a country kid texted you see those moms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can do pretty much anything with duct</v>

615
00:27:01.231 --> 00:27:02.610
<v Speaker 1>tape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

616
00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:05.790
<v Speaker 1>so duct tape,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cardboard just made it up and walked</v>

617
00:27:05.791 --> 00:27:07.300
<v Speaker 1>into the party.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

618
00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:08.910
<v Speaker 1>her grandma opened the door.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She goes,</v>

619
00:27:08.911 --> 00:27:10.410
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jennifer's going to love this.</v>

620
00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:13.560
<v Speaker 1>Walked into.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They literally had a Dr Pepper machine</v>

621
00:27:13.561 --> 00:27:15.200
<v Speaker 1>where it was like old school ones you</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't have to pay,</v>

622
00:27:15.210 --> 00:27:16.740
<v Speaker 1>just push the button.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It pops out.</v>

623
00:27:16.890 --> 00:27:18.180
<v Speaker 1>Thirteen year old kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He loved that.</v>

624
00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:23.220
<v Speaker 1>So we had dr pepper can one end of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dr Pepper Cardboard Sword in the other</v>

625
00:27:23.250 --> 00:27:26.190
<v Speaker 1>walk to the backyard when whenever the</v>
<v Speaker 1>door opens,</v>

626
00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:31.380
<v Speaker 1>I opened the door and breathe there with</v>
<v Speaker 1>like some flashes of lights and fingers</v>

627
00:27:31.381 --> 00:27:32.490
<v Speaker 1>pointing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people laughing.</v>

628
00:27:32.610 --> 00:27:34.440
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember Jennifer saying,</v>

629
00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:37.200
<v Speaker 1>can't believe you thought you were cool</v>
<v Speaker 1>enough to come to my party.</v>

630
00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:38.970
<v Speaker 1>And I was the only one that was dressed</v>
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

631
00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.730
<v Speaker 1>Everybody else had gotten there early</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they all been planning and even the</v>

632
00:27:41.731 --> 00:27:44.670
<v Speaker 1>invitations are fake just so that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>would come there and dress up.</v>

633
00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:46.420
<v Speaker 1>Another kid said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

634
00:27:46.470 --> 00:27:48.690
<v Speaker 1>you're worthless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in that moment I felt worthless.</v>

635
00:27:49.230 --> 00:27:50.350
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

636
00:27:51.150 --> 00:27:53.880
<v Speaker 1>the main bully said you should just kill</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>

637
00:27:53.940 --> 00:27:57.110
<v Speaker 1>And so whenever he said that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>13 years old battle with depression and</v>

638
00:27:57.111 --> 00:27:59.940
<v Speaker 1>suicidal thoughts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all that different stuff minute,</v>

639
00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:03.570
<v Speaker 1>it took me on a downward spiral</v>
<v Speaker 1>tailspin.</v>

640
00:28:04.510 --> 00:28:06.240
<v Speaker 1>It really sucked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know how to cover it up.</v>

641
00:28:06.510 --> 00:28:10.680
<v Speaker 1>And then I guess I'm getting back to</v>
<v Speaker 1>them and may route where I found that 13</v>

642
00:28:10.681 --> 00:28:15.360
<v Speaker 1>years old at like a flea market in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Texas and walking down these aisles and</v>

643
00:28:15.361 --> 00:28:17.670
<v Speaker 1>looking for a bb gun and all of a sudden</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get to the site,</v>

644
00:28:17.671 --> 00:28:20.610
<v Speaker 1>used video shop and it's got UFC vhs.</v>

645
00:28:20.610 --> 00:28:23.910
<v Speaker 1>I think it was two through 10 or 10 to</v>
<v Speaker 1>11 or something like that.</v>

646
00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:24.900
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

647
00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:29.900
<v Speaker 1>so I just let bottom all you were on</v>
<v Speaker 1>there and do that as a horrible story,</v>

648
00:28:30.271 --> 00:28:32.910
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is a terrible story.</v>

649
00:28:33.090 --> 00:28:37.260
<v Speaker 1>How the fuck does kids be so mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that is honestly,</v>

650
00:28:38.020 --> 00:28:41.880
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that crazy compared to,</v>

651
00:28:41.881 --> 00:28:46.000
<v Speaker 1>I mean it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very like a methodical,</v>

652
00:28:46.001 --> 00:28:48.330
<v Speaker 1>like very planned out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in,</v>

653
00:28:48.331 --> 00:28:50.520
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people were in on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that probably was one of the</v>

654
00:28:50.521 --> 00:28:53.280
<v Speaker 1>things like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>honestly Jennifer was that the biggest</v>

655
00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:55.740
<v Speaker 1>crush I ever had in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

656
00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:57.420
<v Speaker 1>elementary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>middle school growing up,</v>

657
00:28:57.421 --> 00:28:59.400
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so she was the one that really</v>

658
00:28:59.401 --> 00:29:01.140
<v Speaker 1>wanted impressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why I did that research,</v>

659
00:29:01.141 --> 00:29:01.861
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you know,</v>

660
00:29:01.861 --> 00:29:04.110
<v Speaker 1>that she was in on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These other guys planned it,</v>

661
00:29:04.111 --> 00:29:06.120
<v Speaker 1>but she went along with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

662
00:29:06.260 --> 00:29:08.780
<v Speaker 1>to her to have her say that to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the,</v>

663
00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:11.910
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe you thought you were</v>
<v Speaker 1>cool enough to come to my party.</v>

664
00:29:12.140 --> 00:29:13.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck man.</v>

665
00:29:13.860 --> 00:29:15.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I ended up leaving.</v>

666
00:29:15.270 --> 00:29:18.090
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is before cell phones.</v>

667
00:29:18.770 --> 00:29:22.410
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have a cell phone until I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>like 16 and 17 and I'm,</v>

668
00:29:23.220 --> 00:29:25.910
<v Speaker 1>so I'm 13,</v>
<v Speaker 1>run out,</v>

669
00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:28.410
<v Speaker 1>found a dairy queen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

670
00:29:28.411 --> 00:29:31.980
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the back and where the drive</v>

671
00:29:31.981 --> 00:29:32.970
<v Speaker 1>through is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was like a,</v>

672
00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:35.670
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dumpster and they get like the fence</v>

673
00:29:35.671 --> 00:29:38.190
<v Speaker 1>around it and I just was able to open</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

674
00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:42.760
<v Speaker 1>sit there and just cried basically until</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone came out to throw away the</v>

675
00:29:42.761 --> 00:29:44.380
<v Speaker 1>trash.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they're like,</v>

676
00:29:44.410 --> 00:29:45.690
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many got down,</v>

677
00:29:46.180 --> 00:29:47.620
<v Speaker 1>what do you need?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And all this other stuff.</v>

678
00:29:47.650 --> 00:29:48.850
<v Speaker 1>Can you call your mom?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

679
00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:51.610
<v Speaker 1>if I have a phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I walked inside,</v>

680
00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:53.320
<v Speaker 1>called her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she wasn't there.</v>

681
00:29:53.321 --> 00:29:55.930
<v Speaker 1>So took a little while to get ahold of</v>
<v Speaker 1>my mom.</v>

682
00:29:56.110 --> 00:29:56.943
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

683
00:29:57.670 --> 00:29:58.503
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was just,</v>

684
00:29:58.540 --> 00:30:03.160
<v Speaker 1>it was nuts because it's weird how you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will believe,</v>

685
00:30:03.730 --> 00:30:07.200
<v Speaker 1>especially in today's age with social</v>
<v Speaker 1>media and all the tweets and things that</v>

686
00:30:07.210 --> 00:30:08.043
<v Speaker 1>people just throw away.</v>

687
00:30:08.170 --> 00:30:09.670
<v Speaker 1>I throw around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

688
00:30:10.060 --> 00:30:10.841
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's nuts.</v>

689
00:30:10.841 --> 00:30:12.460
<v Speaker 1>How can see somebody don't even know</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

690
00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:15.790
<v Speaker 1>They might have one follower,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but somehow it can still,</v>

691
00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:18.880
<v Speaker 1>if you let it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can still affect you instead of just</v>

692
00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:22.030
<v Speaker 1>shrugging it off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a totally different thing though.</v>

693
00:30:22.031 --> 00:30:25.930
<v Speaker 1>So insanely something on twitter and</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone saying something and looking you</v>

694
00:30:25.931 --> 00:30:26.870
<v Speaker 1>in the eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

695
00:30:27.010 --> 00:30:31.010
<v Speaker 1>And planning out this big deception.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

696
00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:33.740
<v Speaker 1>But you're such a nice guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to understand what,</v>

697
00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:36.270
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause it's selling to be such a shithead</v>

698
00:30:36.340 --> 00:30:37.330
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

699
00:30:37.690 --> 00:30:38.800
<v Speaker 1>I don't know man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

700
00:30:39.310 --> 00:30:40.840
<v Speaker 1>I think um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

701
00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:45.160
<v Speaker 1>I've matured a lot where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean obviously 20 minutes at 13,</v>

702
00:30:45.250 --> 00:30:46.810
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

703
00:30:47.590 --> 00:30:52.590
<v Speaker 1>I think I just became an easy target and</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're just a nice guy and they</v>

704
00:30:52.961 --> 00:30:54.970
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe I wouldn't stand up for myself and</v>

705
00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:00.000
<v Speaker 1>maybe I wasn't the biggest kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I was Chubby and bigger and uh,</v>

706
00:31:01.050 --> 00:31:02.230
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

707
00:31:02.231 --> 00:31:04.600
<v Speaker 1>I think it just was easy to pick on me</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the locker rooms,</v>

708
00:31:04.601 --> 00:31:05.434
<v Speaker 1>pick on me in the.</v>

709
00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:07.420
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I think have the stats I was</v>

710
00:31:07.421 --> 00:31:11.680
<v Speaker 1>looking at with something like 87</v>
<v Speaker 1>percent of bullying doesn't happen in</v>

711
00:31:11.681 --> 00:31:14.800
<v Speaker 1>the presence of</v>
<v Speaker 1>adults.</v>

712
00:31:14.801 --> 00:31:15.634
<v Speaker 1>Adults.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

713
00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:17.470
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

714
00:31:18.010 --> 00:31:19.260
<v Speaker 1>I forget,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

715
00:31:19.270 --> 00:31:21.430
<v Speaker 1>even the people around like how you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>

716
00:31:21.460 --> 00:31:23.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two people plan it out and everything</v>

717
00:31:23.771 --> 00:31:26.620
<v Speaker 1>else look you in the eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that might've been what took me</v>

718
00:31:26.621 --> 00:31:29.020
<v Speaker 1>back the most because I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

719
00:31:29.021 --> 00:31:33.540
<v Speaker 1>like this is if you're sitting by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what I tried to tell some of the</v>

720
00:31:33.541 --> 00:31:38.541
<v Speaker 1>kiddos growing up now it's like if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>think that by laughing at me or if</v>

721
00:31:39.071 --> 00:31:40.810
<v Speaker 1>you're there and you're not bullying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're giggling,</v>

722
00:31:40.811 --> 00:31:42.400
<v Speaker 1>you're laughing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you're definitely a part of it.</v>

723
00:31:42.401 --> 00:31:44.920
<v Speaker 1>You're an encourager,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then if you're,</v>

724
00:31:44.950 --> 00:31:48.930
<v Speaker 1>even if you're silent and you're just</v>
<v Speaker 1>watching it and you don't like now your.</v>

725
00:31:48.970 --> 00:31:50.710
<v Speaker 1>If you see it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a choice.</v>

726
00:31:50.770 --> 00:31:54.490
<v Speaker 1>You do something bad at your economic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I feel like that's a passive</v>

727
00:31:55.060 --> 00:31:58.930
<v Speaker 1>standby kind of encouragement where in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for me it was like everyone was</v>

728
00:31:58.931 --> 00:32:00.610
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people were saying it,</v>

729
00:32:00.850 --> 00:32:02.890
<v Speaker 1>people were laughing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people were watching,</v>

730
00:32:03.250 --> 00:32:08.020
<v Speaker 1>but nobody was standing up for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was a think that was what hurt the</v>

731
00:32:08.021 --> 00:32:08.854
<v Speaker 1>most.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll see.</v>

732
00:32:08.860 --> 00:32:12.760
<v Speaker 1>So there's two giant instances.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The one with the other guy named Justin,</v>

733
00:32:12.820 --> 00:32:17.820
<v Speaker 1>so they plan that out to fuck man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You went to school with little kids?</v>

734
00:32:18.191 --> 00:32:20.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was actually part of the same kids.</v>

735
00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:22.490
<v Speaker 1>So yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Damn.</v>

736
00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:23.231
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

737
00:32:23.231 --> 00:32:24.940
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so from that,</v>

738
00:32:25.670 --> 00:32:26.860
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

739
00:32:26.861 --> 00:32:27.340
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

740
00:32:27.340 --> 00:32:32.340
<v Speaker 1>that's definitely been the biggest</v>
<v Speaker 1>battle of my life has been depression,</v>

741
00:32:33.040 --> 00:32:35.440
<v Speaker 1>suicidal thoughts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was all from that bullying.</v>

742
00:32:35.441 --> 00:32:38.620
<v Speaker 1>There was nothing other than that for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the depression.</v>

743
00:32:38.670 --> 00:32:39.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

744
00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:43.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it went from technically I would</v>

745
00:32:43.251 --> 00:32:46.310
<v Speaker 1>say I went from third grade to 10th</v>
<v Speaker 1>grade and then whenever I started</v>

746
00:32:46.311 --> 00:32:48.170
<v Speaker 1>wrestling and my parents transferred me</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of the school,</v>

747
00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:51.170
<v Speaker 1>everything else then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the bullying is what caused all</v>

748
00:32:51.171 --> 00:32:54.090
<v Speaker 1>these suicidal thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing else that was bombed you</v>

749
00:32:54.091 --> 00:32:59.091
<v Speaker 1>out about life that is so fucked up at</v>
<v Speaker 1>some shitty mean kids can all of a</v>

750
00:32:59.781 --> 00:33:01.790
<v Speaker 1>sudden throw this monkey wrench in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

751
00:33:03.740 --> 00:33:04.720
<v Speaker 1>And then I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've learned,</v>

752
00:33:04.721 --> 00:33:07.610
<v Speaker 1>and I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course you know,</v>

753
00:33:07.790 --> 00:33:09.120
<v Speaker 1>a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to looking back at it,</v>

754
00:33:09.121 --> 00:33:11.930
<v Speaker 1>it shouldn't have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't have ever let it get to the</v>

755
00:33:11.931 --> 00:33:14.010
<v Speaker 1>point to where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

756
00:33:14.030 --> 00:33:17.220
<v Speaker 1>I think I should hurt myself or kill me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>

757
00:33:17.340 --> 00:33:21.590
<v Speaker 1>Just a real quick put that together with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pygmies and Congo,</v>

758
00:33:21.890 --> 00:33:24.680
<v Speaker 1>whenever I opened up and shared with</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of them around the campfire,</v>

759
00:33:24.681 --> 00:33:25.630
<v Speaker 1>just hanging out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking,</v>

760
00:33:26.120 --> 00:33:27.170
<v Speaker 1>sharing life stories.</v>

761
00:33:27.710 --> 00:33:32.710
<v Speaker 1>I shared that and I just remember the</v>
<v Speaker 1>looks on several people's faces just so</v>

762
00:33:34.010 --> 00:33:37.760
<v Speaker 1>baffled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like did he just say he wanted to hurt</v>

763
00:33:37.761 --> 00:33:39.230
<v Speaker 1>himself?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You suicide.</v>

764
00:33:39.231 --> 00:33:41.720
<v Speaker 1>He wanted to kill himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll let him and stuff and then I start</v>

765
00:33:41.721 --> 00:33:44.570
<v Speaker 1>asking me does that not happen here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're like,</v>

766
00:33:44.571 --> 00:33:45.590
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of them were like,</v>

767
00:33:45.591 --> 00:33:47.690
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've heard of that happening before and</v>

768
00:33:47.691 --> 00:33:48.390
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

769
00:33:48.390 --> 00:33:50.540
<v Speaker 1>there's this guy that was that guy and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that guy and that guy.</v>

770
00:33:50.570 --> 00:33:54.140
<v Speaker 1>We heard that someone in their village</v>
<v Speaker 1>had hurt themselves or killed themselves</v>

771
00:33:54.141 --> 00:33:56.810
<v Speaker 1>or something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but most of the people I think were</v>

772
00:33:56.811 --> 00:33:57.540
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

773
00:33:57.540 --> 00:33:58.750
<v Speaker 1>I've never heard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would anyone.</v>

774
00:33:59.300 --> 00:34:00.920
<v Speaker 1>If you hurt yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're only like,</v>

775
00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:03.590
<v Speaker 1>it's only hurting you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not going to help anything.</v>

776
00:34:04.220 --> 00:34:06.440
<v Speaker 1>We just wanted the pain to end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

777
00:34:06.470 --> 00:34:08.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here I just wanted the pain to end,</v>

778
00:34:08.750 --> 00:34:10.490
<v Speaker 1>but there it's like it's not because</v>
<v Speaker 1>they.</v>

779
00:34:10.810 --> 00:34:13.310
<v Speaker 1>If,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I look at it as a little kid,</v>

780
00:34:13.311 --> 00:34:16.820
<v Speaker 1>I got bullied by something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some stupid kids,</v>

781
00:34:17.450 --> 00:34:22.450
<v Speaker 1>and then look at if I look at what</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going through and it makes it,</v>

782
00:34:23.870 --> 00:34:25.610
<v Speaker 1>it makes it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it shrinks it,</v>

783
00:34:25.611 --> 00:34:29.810
<v Speaker 1>it makes it microscopic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whenever you stop just focusing on your</v>

784
00:34:29.811 --> 00:34:32.120
<v Speaker 1>own problems and you start looking at</v>
<v Speaker 1>others,</v>

785
00:34:32.330 --> 00:34:35.600
<v Speaker 1>other problems that maybe you can be a</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of helping solve that problem.</v>

786
00:34:35.970 --> 00:34:40.970
<v Speaker 1>So this bullying all throughout your</v>
<v Speaker 1>childhood led into adulthood and the</v>

787
00:34:42.111 --> 00:34:46.940
<v Speaker 1>only thing that made it better was you</v>
<v Speaker 1>go into the Congo and helping out these</v>

788
00:34:46.941 --> 00:34:51.590
<v Speaker 1>pygmies and building wells and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and sort of dedicating and devoting your</v>

789
00:34:51.591 --> 00:34:54.110
<v Speaker 1>life to their life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

790
00:34:54.170 --> 00:34:58.670
<v Speaker 1>I would say practically that has been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

791
00:34:58.671 --> 00:35:01.310
<v Speaker 1>to have a sense of purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I think it's a,</v>

792
00:35:01.820 --> 00:35:05.150
<v Speaker 1>it's a lot of different things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that all Kinda came together.</v>

793
00:35:05.300 --> 00:35:07.030
<v Speaker 1>But for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

794
00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:10.520
<v Speaker 1>I mean when you're not living for</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself and you live in for others,</v>

795
00:35:10.521 --> 00:35:11.780
<v Speaker 1>you just want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

796
00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:17.090
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know that for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a big paradigm shift or change in</v>

797
00:35:17.091 --> 00:35:18.650
<v Speaker 1>my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whenever you know,</v>

798
00:35:18.680 --> 00:35:20.150
<v Speaker 1>coming out of the addiction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I felt like,</v>

799
00:35:20.690 --> 00:35:22.280
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I don't have to walk around and hit</v>

800
00:35:22.281 --> 00:35:24.730
<v Speaker 1>myself in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stay away from people because they're</v>

801
00:35:24.740 --> 00:35:26.930
<v Speaker 1>either going to hurt me or I'm going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to hurt them.</v>

802
00:35:27.290 --> 00:35:28.123
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

803
00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:29.800
<v Speaker 1>I don't have to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can,</v>

804
00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:32.030
<v Speaker 1>I can help people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can want to love them.</v>

805
00:35:32.031 --> 00:35:33.550
<v Speaker 1>I can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

806
00:35:33.620 --> 00:35:37.770
<v Speaker 1>figure out something that I did at first</v>
<v Speaker 1>started at what really started helping a</v>

807
00:35:37.771 --> 00:35:40.200
<v Speaker 1>lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was involved with a lot of different</v>

808
00:35:40.201 --> 00:35:43.770
<v Speaker 1>stuff from a juvenile detention center.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Going in and meeting with some of those</v>

809
00:35:43.771 --> 00:35:48.771
<v Speaker 1>kids once a week to a homeless shelter</v>
<v Speaker 1>to becoming a official volunteer at the</v>

810
00:35:50.370 --> 00:35:52.830
<v Speaker 1>Denver Children's hospital and taking</v>
<v Speaker 1>the grudge guys through there.</v>

811
00:35:52.830 --> 00:35:57.830
<v Speaker 1>And I think like Rashad and Dwayne and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shane Carlin and Brendan and all these</v>

812
00:35:58.681 --> 00:35:59.251
<v Speaker 1>guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

813
00:35:59.251 --> 00:36:02.520
<v Speaker 1>they were going and they actually saw me</v>
<v Speaker 1>going through the really tough,</v>

814
00:36:02.970 --> 00:36:05.610
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>addictions and getting kicked off grudge</v>

815
00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:10.500
<v Speaker 1>fight team.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then a year later I'm luckily able</v>

816
00:36:10.501 --> 00:36:13.590
<v Speaker 1>to organize an event where the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They wouldn't let us come in just as</v>

817
00:36:13.591 --> 00:36:15.960
<v Speaker 1>fighters to visit the kids because they</v>
<v Speaker 1>were like,</v>

818
00:36:15.990 --> 00:36:18.180
<v Speaker 1>fighters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why would you guys come and visit us?</v>

819
00:36:18.630 --> 00:36:20.190
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's violent.</v>

820
00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:23.250
<v Speaker 1>And so I decided to become a volunteer</v>
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>

821
00:36:23.310 --> 00:36:26.310
<v Speaker 1>go through all the processes and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>training and all the other stuff.</v>

822
00:36:26.730 --> 00:36:30.090
<v Speaker 1>And then I love volunteering there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then after they got to know me,</v>

823
00:36:30.150 --> 00:36:30.983
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

824
00:36:30.990 --> 00:36:35.910
<v Speaker 1>can we do a team visit us in there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The best visit they had ever had was the</v>

825
00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:37.530
<v Speaker 1>bikers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

826
00:36:37.531 --> 00:36:40.560
<v Speaker 1>this biker gang guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They always brought pizza on Wednesday</v>

827
00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:41.393
<v Speaker 1>night or something.</v>

828
00:36:41.430 --> 00:36:43.740
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they literally did look,</v>

829
00:36:43.770 --> 00:36:45.780
<v Speaker 1>look rough and tumble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

830
00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:47.310
<v Speaker 1>and then they said ours was a second</v>
<v Speaker 1>pass.</v>

831
00:36:47.311 --> 00:36:48.500
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

832
00:36:48.650 --> 00:36:49.890
<v Speaker 1>and they said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

833
00:36:49.891 --> 00:36:51.780
<v Speaker 1>I won't say the teams,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but some of the other,</v>

834
00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:53.730
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>big major league sports,</v>

835
00:36:53.940 --> 00:36:55.980
<v Speaker 1>they said those have been any named some</v>
<v Speaker 1>of them.</v>

836
00:36:56.310 --> 00:36:57.930
<v Speaker 1>And they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've been some of your absolute</v>

837
00:36:57.931 --> 00:36:58.970
<v Speaker 1>worst.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

838
00:36:59.010 --> 00:37:00.270
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see you thought fighters are going to</v>

839
00:37:00.271 --> 00:37:02.550
<v Speaker 1>come in here and I don't know if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought were going to beat up the kids</v>

840
00:37:02.551 --> 00:37:03.384
<v Speaker 1>or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

841
00:37:03.780 --> 00:37:04.470
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

842
00:37:04.470 --> 00:37:06.870
<v Speaker 1>we were passionate about the sport.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

843
00:37:06.871 --> 00:37:11.310
<v Speaker 1>I think passionate means you love</v>
<v Speaker 1>something so much that you'll suffer for</v>

844
00:37:11.311 --> 00:37:15.360
<v Speaker 1>it were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or even a suffering looks like</v>

845
00:37:15.361 --> 00:37:19.320
<v Speaker 1>enjoyment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our becomes enjoyment because you love</v>

846
00:37:19.321 --> 00:37:21.630
<v Speaker 1>it and you're passionate about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

847
00:37:21.690 --> 00:37:24.390
<v Speaker 1>I mean whenever you're a fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're getting beat up and all the other</v>

848
00:37:24.391 --> 00:37:24.720
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

849
00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:25.380
<v Speaker 1>And we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

850
00:37:25.380 --> 00:37:26.520
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're passionate people.</v>

851
00:37:26.521 --> 00:37:31.521
<v Speaker 1>We really love each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all team come camaraderie and yeah,</v>

852
00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:36.050
<v Speaker 1>there's an intense camaraderie between</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that train together because you</v>

853
00:37:36.060 --> 00:37:40.980
<v Speaker 1>go through such difficult sessions and</v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult sparring and difficult moments</v>

854
00:37:40.981 --> 00:37:45.390
<v Speaker 1>and conditioning and all that stuff and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you push each other and it's a different</v>

855
00:37:45.391 --> 00:37:46.350
<v Speaker 1>kind of bond.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

856
00:37:46.590 --> 00:37:47.281
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And on that,</v>

857
00:37:47.281 --> 00:37:51.930
<v Speaker 1>I think I saw someone recently posted</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that was pretty cool where it</v>

858
00:37:51.931 --> 00:37:54.510
<v Speaker 1>showed a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a Jujitsu gentleman.</v>

859
00:37:54.540 --> 00:37:55.373
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

860
00:37:55.710 --> 00:37:59.160
<v Speaker 1>showing all the different people and in</v>
<v Speaker 1>it it said something like,</v>

861
00:37:59.250 --> 00:38:01.300
<v Speaker 1>this is the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where's the one place you will,</v>

862
00:38:01.330 --> 00:38:03.630
<v Speaker 1>you can find.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was really just people in these</v>

863
00:38:03.660 --> 00:38:06.030
<v Speaker 1>different skin colors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I forget how it was worded,</v>

864
00:38:06.031 --> 00:38:09.540
<v Speaker 1>but yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we all get along and there's all</v>

865
00:38:09.541 --> 00:38:10.374
<v Speaker 1>piece.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

866
00:38:10.890 --> 00:38:12.120
<v Speaker 1>I love that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

867
00:38:12.180 --> 00:38:13.860
<v Speaker 1>I do as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you,</v>

868
00:38:13.950 --> 00:38:18.950
<v Speaker 1>do you stay in any way in touch with</v>
<v Speaker 1>those kids from back in the day from the</v>

869
00:38:20.070 --> 00:38:21.350
<v Speaker 1>kids that bullied you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You.</v>

870
00:38:21.630 --> 00:38:23.460
<v Speaker 1>It was actually funny after the ultimate</v>
<v Speaker 1>fighter,</v>

871
00:38:23.910 --> 00:38:26.520
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got invited out by one of the guys.</v>

872
00:38:27.540 --> 00:38:30.240
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

873
00:38:30.330 --> 00:38:33.330
<v Speaker 1>just because I think a couple of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll just,</v>

874
00:38:33.900 --> 00:38:35.980
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>saw one of the guys who was one of the</v>

875
00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:37.150
<v Speaker 2>main guys and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

876
00:38:37.950 --> 00:38:40.860
<v Speaker 2>I'm walking around downtown Fort Worth</v>
<v Speaker 2>and say,</v>

877
00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:42.100
<v Speaker 2>why don't we go out here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whatever.</v>

878
00:38:42.101 --> 00:38:42.671
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

879
00:38:42.671 --> 00:38:43.504
<v Speaker 2>I'll go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And.</v>

880
00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:47.100
<v Speaker 2>Well he had actually brought me into,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

881
00:38:47.170 --> 00:38:51.250
<v Speaker 2>the Sushi restaurant in all around the</v>
<v Speaker 2>table was most of the people that were</v>

882
00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:53.350
<v Speaker 2>not most is probably only eight or 10</v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

883
00:38:53.740 --> 00:38:57.190
<v Speaker 2>but they were some of the main kids that</v>
<v Speaker 2>were at that party when I dressed up and</v>

884
00:38:57.191 --> 00:38:57.850
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

885
00:38:57.850 --> 00:38:58.683
<v Speaker 2>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>

886
00:38:58.930 --> 00:39:00.800
<v Speaker 2>if we'd have known you were a fighter or</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

887
00:39:00.850 --> 00:39:02.980
<v Speaker 2>you could kick their butts and we</v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't have done that to you.</v>

888
00:39:03.610 --> 00:39:05.130
<v Speaker 2>And I'm just like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I told him I was going to the</v>

889
00:39:05.131 --> 00:39:08.230
<v Speaker 2>bathroom just left from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's the only time I've ever</v>

890
00:39:08.231 --> 00:39:09.850
<v Speaker 2>done anything like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm just like,</v>

891
00:39:09.851 --> 00:39:11.500
<v Speaker 2>I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't be around these guys.</v>

892
00:39:12.490 --> 00:39:16.000
<v Speaker 2>Did you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you sense any feeling of remorse</v>

893
00:39:16.001 --> 00:39:17.830
<v Speaker 2>from them or they just want to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>friends?</v>

894
00:39:17.830 --> 00:39:19.570
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one or two of them?</v>

895
00:39:21.010 --> 00:39:22.210
<v Speaker 2>One guy for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>

896
00:39:22.470 --> 00:39:23.680
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's pretty cool now.</v>

897
00:39:23.890 --> 00:39:27.720
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then one is a,</v>

898
00:39:27.900 --> 00:39:30.300
<v Speaker 2>is a knucklehead for sure and still pick</v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

899
00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:34.900
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's that classic thing of kids ganging</v>

900
00:39:34.901 --> 00:39:38.050
<v Speaker 2>up on one kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a weird instinct that sometimes</v>

901
00:39:38.051 --> 00:39:40.630
<v Speaker 2>children have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You remember that movie Carrie,</v>

902
00:39:40.930 --> 00:39:41.763
<v Speaker 2>when they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

903
00:39:42.130 --> 00:39:45.400
<v Speaker 2>she goes to the prom and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you ever seen these basic moving?</v>

904
00:39:45.580 --> 00:39:48.100
<v Speaker 2>It's based on a great Stephen King Book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't know.</v>

905
00:39:48.150 --> 00:39:53.140
<v Speaker 2>I know that cover the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Sissy space movie was really trippy.</v>

906
00:39:53.740 --> 00:39:57.100
<v Speaker 2>John Travolta's in it back in the day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>young and handsome.</v>

907
00:39:57.580 --> 00:39:59.590
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

908
00:39:59.710 --> 00:40:01.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the themes that they push her.</v>

909
00:40:01.690 --> 00:40:05.140
<v Speaker 2>She has these crazy telekinetic powers</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they push her to this point and they</v>

910
00:40:05.141 --> 00:40:08.710
<v Speaker 2>do it by mocking her and bullying her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They take her to the prom and they pour</v>

911
00:40:08.711 --> 00:40:11.410
<v Speaker 2>pig's blood on her head,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which winds up killing everybody.</v>

912
00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:12.521
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

913
00:40:12.521 --> 00:40:13.660
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty crazy.</v>

914
00:40:13.661 --> 00:40:18.661
<v Speaker 2>But that's that thing that happens when</v>
<v Speaker 2>kids gang up on a kid that they feel</v>

915
00:40:19.181 --> 00:40:20.890
<v Speaker 2>like is vulnerable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

916
00:40:20.891 --> 00:40:23.890
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck is that man?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What a horrible instinct like.</v>

917
00:40:23.891 --> 00:40:26.860
<v Speaker 2>Is that</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I mean?</v>

918
00:40:27.350 --> 00:40:28.360
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

919
00:40:28.450 --> 00:40:33.450
<v Speaker 2>I struggle to understand where that</v>
<v Speaker 2>instinct comes from or why people do it.</v>

920
00:40:34.780 --> 00:40:37.560
<v Speaker 2>It's um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially little kids know.</v>

921
00:40:37.700 --> 00:40:39.880
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess I could understand that if the</v>

922
00:40:39.881 --> 00:40:43.090
<v Speaker 2>kids have been abused themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they want to lash out there angry and</v>

923
00:40:43.091 --> 00:40:45.010
<v Speaker 2>hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But oftentimes it's just,</v>

924
00:40:45.011 --> 00:40:49.120
<v Speaker 2>they find someone who's vulnerable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like they find the pecking order</v>

925
00:40:49.150 --> 00:40:52.690
<v Speaker 2>and they'd find that one person that can</v>
<v Speaker 2>get away with and they all funnel their</v>

926
00:40:52.691 --> 00:40:56.290
<v Speaker 2>insecurities and their anger and their</v>
<v Speaker 2>aggression on this one person just</v>

927
00:40:56.291 --> 00:41:00.130
<v Speaker 2>because with no regard whatsoever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what kind of impact it's gonna have on</v>

928
00:41:00.131 --> 00:41:01.110
<v Speaker 2>that kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

929
00:41:01.180 --> 00:41:03.010
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think one of the things that makes it</v>

930
00:41:03.011 --> 00:41:06.490
<v Speaker 2>so much worse now is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

931
00:41:06.580 --> 00:41:09.010
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get to hear some of the stuff that</v>

932
00:41:09.011 --> 00:41:13.690
<v Speaker 2>they can't escape it because it follows</v>
<v Speaker 2>them home cyberbullying and they get the</v>

933
00:41:13.691 --> 00:41:16.750
<v Speaker 2>text and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all this stuff is so it's constantly.</v>

934
00:41:17.230 --> 00:41:20.260
<v Speaker 2>So I could at least escape it from eight</v>
<v Speaker 2>to three,</v>

935
00:41:20.350 --> 00:41:23.920
<v Speaker 2>eight to three I was at school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when I came home I was,</v>

936
00:41:23.980 --> 00:41:25.120
<v Speaker 2>I was okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

937
00:41:25.180 --> 00:41:28.210
<v Speaker 2>maybe that gave me a break but a little</v>
<v Speaker 2>bit of a break from it.</v>

938
00:41:28.211 --> 00:41:29.010
<v Speaker 2>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

939
00:41:29.010 --> 00:41:31.930
<v Speaker 2>that's the world that we live in and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff that's happening.</v>

940
00:41:31.931 --> 00:41:32.950
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you said happened.</v>

941
00:41:33.710 --> 00:41:34.070
<v Speaker 2>Germany</v>

942
00:41:34.070 --> 00:41:35.720
<v Speaker 1>and other like school shootings that</v>
<v Speaker 1>have happened here.</v>

943
00:41:35.721 --> 00:41:39.080
<v Speaker 1>I was in Aurora when the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the movie theater thing happened.</v>

944
00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:41.900
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's just terrible.</v>

945
00:41:41.960 --> 00:41:44.240
<v Speaker 1>But then I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's absolutely,</v>

946
00:41:44.720 --> 00:41:48.230
<v Speaker 1>without a doubt the zero excuse for you</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't ever do anything like that.</v>

947
00:41:48.231 --> 00:41:51.890
<v Speaker 1>But then I kind of have looked at it</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe once before.</v>

948
00:41:51.891 --> 00:41:53.570
<v Speaker 1>It might be stupid for me to talk about</v>
<v Speaker 1>it now.</v>

949
00:41:53.960 --> 00:41:57.590
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I kind of can see where they've been</v>

950
00:41:57.591 --> 00:42:00.590
<v Speaker 1>pushed over the edge and wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no excuse,</v>

951
00:42:01.070 --> 00:42:02.540
<v Speaker 1>they should not ever do anything like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

952
00:42:03.140 --> 00:42:04.700
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for me it's like,</v>

953
00:42:04.790 --> 00:42:05.320
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

954
00:42:05.320 --> 00:42:06.950
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was never a fair fight.</v>

955
00:42:07.460 --> 00:42:12.460
<v Speaker 1>They were always cornered a outnumbered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm beaten down over and over and over,</v>

956
00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:15.630
<v Speaker 1>and then they just snapped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

957
00:42:15.710 --> 00:42:17.330
<v Speaker 1>now it's terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't.</v>

958
00:42:17.980 --> 00:42:19.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that's the case of the</v>

959
00:42:19.461 --> 00:42:20.560
<v Speaker 1>Aurora shooter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

960
00:42:20.561 --> 00:42:20.960
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

961
00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:22.190
<v Speaker 1>He's completely insane.</v>

962
00:42:22.240 --> 00:42:25.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think it certainly can happen to</v>

963
00:42:25.911 --> 00:42:28.790
<v Speaker 1>people where they get to this point when</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only do they not want to live,</v>

964
00:42:28.820 --> 00:42:31.670
<v Speaker 1>they don't want you to live anymore</v>
<v Speaker 1>either because I mean,</v>

965
00:42:31.671 --> 00:42:34.970
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure if you had been in a situation</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you knew someone,</v>

966
00:42:34.971 --> 00:42:37.410
<v Speaker 1>you had a friend who was in the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>boat as you,</v>

967
00:42:37.690 --> 00:42:38.181
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

968
00:42:38.181 --> 00:42:40.070
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those kids from columbine,</v>

969
00:42:40.650 --> 00:42:44.570
<v Speaker 1>whether the two kids got together and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they sort of helped each other do</v>

970
00:42:44.571 --> 00:42:47.930
<v Speaker 1>something really fucked up if you were</v>
<v Speaker 1>involved with the wrong people at that</v>

971
00:42:47.931 --> 00:42:50.600
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone had a gun and you knew where</v>

972
00:42:50.601 --> 00:42:53.660
<v Speaker 1>these kids were and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you wanted to do that to yourself.</v>

973
00:42:53.690 --> 00:42:55.910
<v Speaker 1>Who knows what you would have wanted to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do to them as well.</v>

974
00:42:56.270 --> 00:42:56.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

975
00:42:56.790 --> 00:42:58.520
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of a scary thing to think</v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

976
00:42:58.521 --> 00:43:01.040
<v Speaker 1>I did have a dark period.</v>

977
00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:03.260
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was in between seventh and</v>

978
00:43:03.261 --> 00:43:04.730
<v Speaker 1>eighth grade where they're hanging out</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a lot of the,</v>

979
00:43:05.570 --> 00:43:06.430
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just the,</v>

980
00:43:06.580 --> 00:43:11.580
<v Speaker 1>the kids that were involved in just</v>
<v Speaker 1>darker thoughts,</v>

981
00:43:11.900 --> 00:43:13.610
<v Speaker 1>music,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff like that where it,</v>

982
00:43:13.611 --> 00:43:14.650
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where,</v>

983
00:43:14.720 --> 00:43:16.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hanging out with them and we're all,</v>

984
00:43:16.610 --> 00:43:18.700
<v Speaker 1>we're all depressed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

985
00:43:18.710 --> 00:43:21.440
<v Speaker 1>and we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're listening to that Papa Roach Song,</v>

986
00:43:21.441 --> 00:43:23.330
<v Speaker 1>the last resort,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

987
00:43:23.540 --> 00:43:26.150
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's like cut myself bleeding,</v>

988
00:43:26.450 --> 00:43:28.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm never gonna I don't want to breathe</v>

989
00:43:28.911 --> 00:43:30.560
<v Speaker 1>again or live again or something like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

990
00:43:30.561 --> 00:43:32.520
<v Speaker 1>And then all of a sudden they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>bringing out a,</v>

991

<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

993
00:43:36.900 --> 00:43:39.620

<v Speaker 1>in the country and they'd go get the</v>

<v Speaker 1>when that happened,</v>

1009
00:44:11.241 --> 00:44:11.811
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1010
00:44:11.811 --> 00:44:13.790
<v Speaker 1>I need to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to change the.</v>

1011
00:44:14.130 --> 00:44:16.610
<v Speaker 1>That was a group of like five or six</v>
<v Speaker 1>kids that were just in a very,</v>

1012
00:44:16.611 --> 00:44:21.611
<v Speaker 1>very dark place and even ones in jail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So fuck dude,</v>

1013
00:44:22.910 --> 00:44:26.330
<v Speaker 1>what a bar bombing me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to do that every time</v>

1014
00:44:26.331 --> 00:44:29.720
<v Speaker 1>you've been here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just been all joyful and loving and</v>

1015
00:44:29.721 --> 00:44:31.740
<v Speaker 1>all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know your history</v>

1016
00:44:32.310 --> 00:44:33.031
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey Man.</v>

1017
00:44:33.031 --> 00:44:35.280
<v Speaker 2>It's just honest expression.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing wrong with it.</v>

1018
00:44:35.310 --> 00:44:39.300
<v Speaker 2>It's just it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It makes me as an adult,</v>

1019
00:44:39.930 --> 00:44:43.320
<v Speaker 2>I almost want to go back in time and</v>
<v Speaker 2>stop it from happening.</v>

1020
00:44:43.740 --> 00:44:45.030
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it makes me,</v>

1021
00:44:46.140 --> 00:44:47.610
<v Speaker 2>it makes me very sad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

1022
00:44:48.030 --> 00:44:52.080
<v Speaker 2>it's one of the worst aspects of human</v>
<v Speaker 2>beings that they could plan something</v>

1023
00:44:52.081 --> 00:44:56.250
<v Speaker 2>like that and do that and just try to</v>
<v Speaker 2>ruin someone's life just for sport,</v>

1024
00:44:56.430 --> 00:44:59.460
<v Speaker 2>just for fun for no reason.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You didn't do anything to them.</v>

1025
00:44:59.461 --> 00:45:00.294
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1026
00:45:00.470 --> 00:45:01.470
<v Speaker 2>it's fucked up man.</v>

1027
00:45:01.630 --> 00:45:06.630
<v Speaker 1>I see it as a thing that actually helped</v>
<v Speaker 1>shape and mold me now in a way of like,</v>

1028
00:45:08.050 --> 00:45:10.060
<v Speaker 1>I look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was Loretta while we're writing the</v>

1029
00:45:10.061 --> 00:45:10.894
<v Speaker 1>book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's like,</v>

1030
00:45:11.110 --> 00:45:13.030
<v Speaker 1>do you not see all these kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>parallels?</v>

1031
00:45:13.031 --> 00:45:14.680
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you mean you grew up?</v>

1032
00:45:15.060 --> 00:45:16.090
<v Speaker 1>He got really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really bullied.</v>

1033
00:45:16.560 --> 00:45:19.600
<v Speaker 1>Then I tried to help people that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>like maybe the most bully people on</v>

1034
00:45:19.601 --> 00:45:21.160
<v Speaker 1>planet earth and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1035
00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:22.730
<v Speaker 1>I guess I see that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1036
00:45:22.740 --> 00:45:24.590
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or was it last month?</v>

1037
00:45:24.660 --> 00:45:26.590
<v Speaker 1>Last trip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the second last trip to Congo,</v>

1038
00:45:26.610 --> 00:45:30.280
<v Speaker 1>that ad was there and we're having to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get a mechanic to help.</v>

1039
00:45:30.830 --> 00:45:34.540
<v Speaker 1>We were tired and different stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also I'm a drunk mechanic comes out</v>

1040
00:45:34.541 --> 00:45:38.200
<v Speaker 1>and he's always drunk and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he comes out talking with us.</v>

1041
00:45:38.500 --> 00:45:40.630
<v Speaker 1>It's a little boy walks by.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's literally,</v>

1042
00:45:41.620 --> 00:45:44.410
<v Speaker 1>he should be in school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but because his family's so poor,</v>

1043
00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:47.710
<v Speaker 1>he's out selling eggs and if he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>selling eggs you can make,</v>

1044
00:45:47.940 --> 00:45:50.830
<v Speaker 1>you know nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we'll never be able to go to school</v>

1045
00:45:50.831 --> 00:45:51.340
<v Speaker 1>probably.</v>

1046
00:45:51.340 --> 00:45:53.740
<v Speaker 1>And he's just trying to make money to</v>
<v Speaker 1>feed his family.</v>

1047
00:45:53.741 --> 00:45:54.820
<v Speaker 1>And he's literally five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>six,</v>

1048
00:45:54.821 --> 00:45:57.520
<v Speaker 1>seven years old and he's coming around</v>
<v Speaker 1>with selling the eggs.</v>

1049
00:45:58.150 --> 00:46:00.110
<v Speaker 1>Normally they sell them hard boiled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1050
00:46:00.280 --> 00:46:03.310
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes they don't when they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they're walking around you want eat</v>

1051
00:46:03.311 --> 00:46:05.770
<v Speaker 1>it then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this kids were all raw and so it's</v>

1052
00:46:05.771 --> 00:46:07.600
<v Speaker 1>even harder for them to sell them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1053
00:46:07.990 --> 00:46:11.290
<v Speaker 1>but the drunk guy picked up the egg.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's looking at it,</v>

1054
00:46:11.410 --> 00:46:14.410
<v Speaker 1>shakes a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>finds out it's raw and just smashes him.</v>

1055
00:46:15.250 --> 00:46:16.900
<v Speaker 1>The Kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is an adult,</v>

1056
00:46:17.440 --> 00:46:21.010
<v Speaker 1>30 something year old man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is literally a five,</v>

1057
00:46:21.011 --> 00:46:21.461
<v Speaker 1>six,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven,</v>

1058
00:46:21.461 --> 00:46:24.310
<v Speaker 1>eight year old kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just smashes it over his head and the</v>

1059
00:46:24.311 --> 00:46:26.780
<v Speaker 1>kid looks up at him with just fear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1060
00:46:26.820 --> 00:46:28.660
<v Speaker 1>it's not smart for me because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1061
00:46:29.020 --> 00:46:30.280
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1062
00:46:30.281 --> 00:46:33.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm the outsider to the government's</v>
<v Speaker 1>eyes and everything else,</v>

1063
00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:35.440
<v Speaker 1>but like I almost got in a fistfight</v>
<v Speaker 1>with him.</v>

1064
00:46:35.740 --> 00:46:37.560
<v Speaker 1>I remember just pulling my hand straight</v>
<v Speaker 1>back and,</v>

1065
00:46:38.530 --> 00:46:41.170
<v Speaker 1>and just almost just back in them right</v>
<v Speaker 1>across the face.</v>

1066
00:46:41.230 --> 00:46:42.480
<v Speaker 1>And then Ben's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

1067
00:46:42.481 --> 00:46:43.090
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>

1068
00:46:43.090 --> 00:46:44.860
<v Speaker 1>Then I grabbed the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I grabbed a shirt,</v>

1069
00:46:45.270 --> 00:46:47.500
<v Speaker 1>grab the shoulder and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ben,</v>

1070
00:46:47.501 --> 00:46:50.170
<v Speaker 1>translate from real quick if he ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>leaves his hands on that kid or any</v>

1071
00:46:50.171 --> 00:46:51.970
<v Speaker 1>other kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm only my hands on him.</v>

1072
00:46:52.120 --> 00:46:54.990
<v Speaker 1>And so just make sure you understand</v>
<v Speaker 1>that this kind of thing.</v>

1073
00:46:54.991 --> 00:46:57.610
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know a woman that except</v>

1074
00:46:57.611 --> 00:46:59.380
<v Speaker 1>for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I just don't get,</v>

1075
00:47:00.310 --> 00:47:02.660
<v Speaker 1>get people sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1076
00:47:02.980 --> 00:47:04.840
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll get into some positive stuff with</v>

1077
00:47:04.841 --> 00:47:05.980
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That will just blew me away.</v>

1078
00:47:05.981 --> 00:47:08.530
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're an old guy picking on a</v>

1079
00:47:08.810 --> 00:47:10.420
<v Speaker 1>kindergartener.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

1080
00:47:11.560 --> 00:47:12.393
<v Speaker 1>as a,</v>

1081
00:47:13.300 --> 00:47:16.690
<v Speaker 2>as a person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand it,</v>

1082
00:47:16.691 --> 00:47:19.960
<v Speaker 2>but I also don't understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like logically I don't understand like</v>

1083
00:47:19.961 --> 00:47:22.020
<v Speaker 2>where that inclination comes from it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what,</v>

1084
00:47:22.050 --> 00:47:25.210
<v Speaker 2>what is it about a human being that</v>
<v Speaker 2>makes them want to do that?</v>

1085
00:47:25.211 --> 00:47:27.570
<v Speaker 2>Like what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>

1086
00:47:27.700 --> 00:47:30.160
<v Speaker 2>how did that develop?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How is it so common?</v>

1087
00:47:30.650 --> 00:47:32.150
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1088
00:47:32.260 --> 00:47:36.970
<v Speaker 1>I guess when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>put someone down you feel better about</v>

1089
00:47:36.971 --> 00:47:38.790
<v Speaker 1>yourself and to really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1090
00:47:39.560 --> 00:47:41.890
<v Speaker 1>I know what I've found is the exact</v>
<v Speaker 1>opposite.</v>

1091
00:47:41.891 --> 00:47:43.900
<v Speaker 1>When you help somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it actually helps you.</v>

1092
00:47:43.960 --> 00:47:45.960
<v Speaker 1>Of course somebody you feel more loved</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you,</v>

1093
00:47:46.760 --> 00:47:47.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so um,</v>

1094
00:47:47.980 --> 00:47:51.820
<v Speaker 1>so it's counterintuitive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's kind of what people do re do</v>

1095
00:47:51.821 --> 00:47:54.960
<v Speaker 1>the opposite of what we could or should.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's so common.</v>

1096
00:47:55.190 --> 00:47:57.670
<v Speaker 1>I wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what is the cause,</v>

1097
00:47:57.671 --> 00:48:01.630
<v Speaker 1>the root cause of it or does it play</v>
<v Speaker 1>some sort of evolutionary role?</v>

1098
00:48:01.810 --> 00:48:04.630
<v Speaker 1>Like what is it like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like pecking order with chickens?</v>

1099
00:48:04.720 --> 00:48:07.540
<v Speaker 1>Like they try to find out who's the</v>
<v Speaker 1>weakest one and they all attack.</v>

1100
00:48:07.541 --> 00:48:10.510
<v Speaker 1>They'll all tackling the weakest chicken</v>
<v Speaker 1>that'll all peck at it.</v>

1101
00:48:10.820 --> 00:48:13.180
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is that?</v>

1102
00:48:13.181 --> 00:48:16.360
<v Speaker 1>Like why is it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are they trying to weed out the weak?</v>

1103
00:48:16.390 --> 00:48:18.190
<v Speaker 1>Is it an evolutionary thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it,</v>

1104
00:48:18.610 --> 00:48:21.670
<v Speaker 1>are they terrified of someone doing that</v>
<v Speaker 1>to them?</v>

1105
00:48:21.671 --> 00:48:23.860
<v Speaker 1>So they strike first?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1106
00:48:23.861 --> 00:48:26.260
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's actually a pretty incredible</v>

1107
00:48:26.261 --> 00:48:27.290
<v Speaker 1>video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hang onto.</v>

1108
00:48:27.330 --> 00:48:29.410
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of the voice is actually a</v>

1109
00:48:29.540 --> 00:48:33.830
<v Speaker 1>pretty incredible video that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was absolutely terrible whenever I</v>

1110
00:48:33.850 --> 00:48:35.230
<v Speaker 1>gave the speech or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I,</v>

1111
00:48:35.350 --> 00:48:37.800
<v Speaker 1>I played part of the video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cut it down to like three minutes and</v>

1112
00:48:37.801 --> 00:48:40.170
<v Speaker 1>say like 12,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's called the battle at</v>

1113
00:48:40.171 --> 00:48:41.230
<v Speaker 1>Kruger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you seen that?</v>

1114
00:48:41.330 --> 00:48:42.430
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's in Africa.</v>

1115
00:48:43.090 --> 00:48:45.170
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have seen this.</v>

1116
00:48:45.570 --> 00:48:50.080
<v Speaker 1>The water buffaloes are back in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The crocodile lion takes the,</v>

1117
00:48:50.800 --> 00:48:52.930
<v Speaker 1>the back of the pack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The smaller,</v>

1118
00:48:52.960 --> 00:48:56.110
<v Speaker 1>weaker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>younger lions all go after that one,</v>

1119
00:48:56.470 --> 00:49:00.850
<v Speaker 1>tackle it splashing water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're dragging the baby out of the,</v>

1120
00:49:01.210 --> 00:49:05.830
<v Speaker 1>out of the lake or river and all of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>sudden a huge crocodile comes and grabs</v>

1121
00:49:05.831 --> 00:49:10.480
<v Speaker 1>it and they have a tug of war match with</v>
<v Speaker 1>this baby.</v>

1122
00:49:10.690 --> 00:49:13.060
<v Speaker 1>I think it was a Cape Buffalo Buffalo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1123
00:49:13.780 --> 00:49:14.613
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1124
00:49:14.800 --> 00:49:16.330
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't a will to be straight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was Keto flu.</v>

1125
00:49:16.390 --> 00:49:18.370
<v Speaker 1>I think it was one of those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

1126
00:49:18.870 --> 00:49:19.660
<v Speaker 1>and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not split.</v>

1127
00:49:19.660 --> 00:49:24.660
<v Speaker 1>What I love almost in that analogy of</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you know if you're standing by</v>

1128
00:49:25.630 --> 00:49:27.970
<v Speaker 1>like you're encouraging it or if you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>not doing anything,</v>

1129
00:49:27.971 --> 00:49:29.410
<v Speaker 1>you're encouraging it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you just stand up,</v>

1130
00:49:29.440 --> 00:49:32.200
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the stat I saw where 87 percent</v>

1131
00:49:32.770 --> 00:49:34.960
<v Speaker 1>of bullying happens in the presence of</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody,</v>

1132
00:49:35.350 --> 00:49:38.110
<v Speaker 1>but in the times that it is around</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

1133
00:49:38.350 --> 00:49:41.560
<v Speaker 1>If one person says one thing to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>bully,</v>

1134
00:49:42.640 --> 00:49:47.200
<v Speaker 1>90 percent of the time it's 80 to 90</v>
<v Speaker 1>percent of the time it stops within five</v>

1135
00:49:47.201 --> 00:49:48.220
<v Speaker 1>seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The bullying,</v>

1136
00:49:48.340 --> 00:49:50.740
<v Speaker 1>it just stops and it doesn't have to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything aggressive.</v>

1137
00:49:50.741 --> 00:49:53.270
<v Speaker 1>It can be a man lay off of them and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you.</v>

1138
00:49:53.800 --> 00:49:56.800
<v Speaker 1>After that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's something like 95 percent of the</v>

1139
00:49:56.801 --> 00:49:59.080
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you invite the bullied victim to come</v>

1140
00:49:59.081 --> 00:50:01.840
<v Speaker 1>into your group or hang out or sit at</v>
<v Speaker 1>your table or whatever,</v>

1141
00:50:02.500 --> 00:50:05.110
<v Speaker 1>then it stops even even better right</v>
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>

1142
00:50:05.111 --> 00:50:07.810
<v Speaker 1>When you don't address the bully.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You addressed the person that's getting</v>

1143
00:50:07.811 --> 00:50:09.820
<v Speaker 1>bullied.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it seems like the people that are</v>

1144
00:50:09.821 --> 00:50:12.450
<v Speaker 1>bullying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they almost need reinforcement and they</v>

1145
00:50:12.451 --> 00:50:14.170
<v Speaker 1>get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're getting reinforced by people</v>

1146
00:50:14.171 --> 00:50:17.620
<v Speaker 1>being complicit or being silent or</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're joining like those lines.</v>

1147
00:50:17.770 --> 00:50:19.850
<v Speaker 1>One line decided to take out the little</v>
<v Speaker 1>guys.</v>

1148
00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:23.370
<v Speaker 1>They just food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were handled.</v>

1149
00:50:23.380 --> 00:50:25.690
<v Speaker 1>That's how they stay alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a natural instinct.</v>

1150
00:50:25.691 --> 00:50:28.210
<v Speaker 1>This is a weird either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>

1151
00:50:28.620 --> 00:50:32.270
<v Speaker 1>the one thing I do like about it though</v>
<v Speaker 1>is with those two stats,</v>

1152
00:50:32.280 --> 00:50:34.310
<v Speaker 1>like say something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't be passive.</v>

1153
00:50:34.580 --> 00:50:38.060
<v Speaker 1>Whenever one Cape Buffalo turned around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a couple of other ones did too.</v>

1154
00:50:38.430 --> 00:50:38.770
<v Speaker 1>And then we'll.</v>

1155
00:50:38.770 --> 00:50:40.960
<v Speaker 1>One came in there in the middle of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>law.</v>

1156
00:50:41.120 --> 00:50:44.690
<v Speaker 1>One hit one line through it in the air</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then all of them tucked tail and</v>

1157
00:50:44.691 --> 00:50:45.620
<v Speaker 1>ran.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1158
00:50:45.621 --> 00:50:48.020
<v Speaker 1>Once I realized what a Cape Buffalo can</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually do to them,</v>

1159
00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:50.620
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's so terrible.</v>

1160
00:50:50.640 --> 00:50:51.441
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cape Buffalo,</v>

1161
00:50:51.441 --> 00:50:56.441
<v Speaker 1>I was apparently are some of the most</v>
<v Speaker 1>dangerous animals in Africa and they</v>

1162
00:50:56.751 --> 00:51:00.290
<v Speaker 1>will charge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can just so used to being around</v>

1163
00:51:00.291 --> 00:51:01.430
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1164
00:51:01.820 --> 00:51:04.070
<v Speaker 1>or around animals rather than trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>kill them.</v>

1165
00:51:04.120 --> 00:51:07.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I almost got us arrested and not a,</v>

1166
00:51:07.880 --> 00:51:10.640
<v Speaker 1>not just a little bit where we</v>
<v Speaker 1>accidentally,</v>

1167
00:51:10.820 --> 00:51:13.700
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe the Serengeti in Tanzania and</v>

1168
00:51:13.701 --> 00:51:16.700
<v Speaker 1>we're on the border of Kenya and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tanzania and we're taking a shortcut</v>

1169
00:51:16.701 --> 00:51:19.820
<v Speaker 1>from some locals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is always fine if you're from</v>

1170
00:51:19.821 --> 00:51:22.460
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we saw this awesome,</v>

1171
00:51:22.660 --> 00:51:24.080
<v Speaker 1>but we didn't know we were going through</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Serengeti.</v>

1172
00:51:24.081 --> 00:51:26.690
<v Speaker 1>They just thought it was a shortcut.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We didn't pay for a park,</v>

1173
00:51:26.691 --> 00:51:28.460
<v Speaker 1>pass her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything like that.</v>

1174
00:51:28.760 --> 00:51:32.840
<v Speaker 1>And also I see this gigantic Cape</v>
<v Speaker 1>Buffalo skull just sitting in the middle</v>

1175
00:51:32.841 --> 00:51:33.830
<v Speaker 1>of nowhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1176
00:51:34.160 --> 00:51:35.570
<v Speaker 1>let's get that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's take it back.</v>

1177
00:51:35.571 --> 00:51:37.460
<v Speaker 1>And so we put that in the back of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>truck.</v>

1178
00:51:37.820 --> 00:51:41.150
<v Speaker 1>All of a sudden we're driving and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we get pulled over by the park rangers.</v>

1179
00:51:41.540 --> 00:51:44.430
<v Speaker 1>Then they see the Cape Buffalo skull.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They say we're poachers say this,</v>

1180
00:51:44.450 --> 00:51:46.400
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the just swarmed by,</v>

1181
00:51:46.401 --> 00:51:47.600
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by all these,</v>

1182
00:51:47.720 --> 00:51:49.880
<v Speaker 1>these park rangers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like three or four different vehicles</v>

1183
00:51:50.500 --> 00:51:53.720
<v Speaker 1>and arrest me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all this different stuff and enter crew.</v>

1184
00:51:53.900 --> 00:51:55.400
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>luckily anyways,</v>

1185
00:51:55.401 --> 00:51:57.200
<v Speaker 1>that's a random thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But luckily we just said,</v>

1186
00:51:57.201 --> 00:51:58.730
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can I just put it right back where it</v>

1187
00:51:58.731 --> 00:51:59.630
<v Speaker 1>was?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't,</v>

1188
00:52:00.080 --> 00:52:02.180
<v Speaker 1>I didn't mean to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know we were in a national</v>

1189
00:52:02.181 --> 00:52:04.040
<v Speaker 1>park.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1190
00:52:04.041 --> 00:52:06.740
<v Speaker 1>They don't take any bullshit from</v>
<v Speaker 1>poachers out there.</v>

1191
00:52:06.741 --> 00:52:09.980
<v Speaker 1>It's very dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They kill poachers on site.</v>

1192
00:52:11.060 --> 00:52:12.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can kill them.</v>

1193
00:52:12.741 --> 00:52:14.180
<v Speaker 1>Where it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of times it's,</v>

1194
00:52:14.181 --> 00:52:18.500
<v Speaker 1>I'm literally the life in prison</v>
<v Speaker 1>sentence for poaching.</v>

1195
00:52:18.530 --> 00:52:19.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For,</v>

1196
00:52:19.100 --> 00:52:21.200
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for um,</v>

1197
00:52:22.010 --> 00:52:23.900
<v Speaker 1>like endangered species for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with like,</v>

1198
00:52:23.901 --> 00:52:25.490
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Okapi,</v>

1199
00:52:25.760 --> 00:52:27.680
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of my last trips and we'll try to,</v>

1200
00:52:28.120 --> 00:52:31.610
<v Speaker 1>I think I maybe said that earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where a on one of the past episodes</v>

1201
00:52:31.611 --> 00:52:36.611
<v Speaker 1>where someone tried to sell me the meat</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the fur of an Okapi and then,</v>

1202
00:52:37.400 --> 00:52:38.380
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1203
00:52:38.390 --> 00:52:39.830
<v Speaker 1>cubbies are in danger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1204
00:52:40.160 --> 00:52:43.010
<v Speaker 1>And they're only found in the one area</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we're,</v>

1205
00:52:43.130 --> 00:52:48.130
<v Speaker 1>we're kind of working in and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the rebel groups there went to will</v>

1206
00:52:49.010 --> 00:52:52.540
<v Speaker 1>wildlife reserve for them protecting</v>
<v Speaker 1>them and uh,</v>

1207
00:52:52.580 --> 00:52:54.560
<v Speaker 1>they wouldn't hurt her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1208
00:52:54.561 --> 00:52:55.670
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

1209
00:52:55.671 --> 00:52:59.360
<v Speaker 1>15 or 20 of them sleep that were there</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to help stimulate,</v>

1210
00:52:59.460 --> 00:53:01.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come help them come back in the wild and</v>

1211
00:53:01.701 --> 00:53:03.320
<v Speaker 1>everything else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's wouldn't killed them all.</v>

1212
00:53:04.090 --> 00:53:05.180
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1213
00:53:05.181 --> 00:53:06.960
<v Speaker 1>And then another guy was trying to sell</v>
<v Speaker 1>me a,</v>

1214
00:53:06.970 --> 00:53:08.900
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a rhino horn.</v>

1215
00:53:09.230 --> 00:53:12.140
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's just brutal.</v>

1216
00:53:12.320 --> 00:53:17.320
<v Speaker 1>Now poaching sucks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I love how the pygmies culture has</v>

1217
00:53:17.691 --> 00:53:18.500
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with hunting.</v>

1218
00:53:18.500 --> 00:53:20.600
<v Speaker 1>I even have a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a quick video.</v>

1219
00:53:20.601 --> 00:53:21.550
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I,</v>

1220
00:53:21.590 --> 00:53:22.490
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1221
00:53:22.730 --> 00:53:26.230
<v Speaker 1>did you see what they're doing where</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're making three d printed a</v>

1222
00:53:26.280 --> 00:53:29.760
<v Speaker 2>cloned rhino horns and they're going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>flood the market with them?</v>

1223
00:53:31.050 --> 00:53:32.460
<v Speaker 2>That's a great idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1224
00:53:32.520 --> 00:53:35.070
<v Speaker 2>To see if he could find that out with</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jim Shark fins too,</v>

1225
00:53:35.071 --> 00:53:36.090
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1226
00:53:36.840 --> 00:53:37.810
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're um,</v>

1227
00:53:38.130 --> 00:53:41.340
<v Speaker 2>Amelie's people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Each arc fens needs.</v>

1228
00:53:41.520 --> 00:53:44.580
<v Speaker 2>It's fucked up that they're killing them</v>
<v Speaker 2>all and make soup out of them,</v>

1229
00:53:44.581 --> 00:53:46.140
<v Speaker 2>but she's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least they're eating them.</v>

1230
00:53:46.150 --> 00:53:48.170
<v Speaker 2>These are the Rhino thing is insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1231
00:53:48.440 --> 00:53:52.050
<v Speaker 2>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's absolutely based on nothing.</v>

1232
00:53:52.590 --> 00:53:55.950
<v Speaker 2>I mean the I medicine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's crazy.</v>

1233
00:53:56.970 --> 00:54:01.970
<v Speaker 2>I just can't imagine that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here we are in 2016 with Viagra and</v>

1234
00:54:02.911 --> 00:54:06.570
<v Speaker 2>Cialis and all these different boner</v>
<v Speaker 2>pills you buy at the gas station.</v>

1235
00:54:06.571 --> 00:54:08.510
<v Speaker 2>That red bad takes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I was pulling this up,</v>

1236
00:54:08.530 --> 00:54:12.230
<v Speaker 2>I've found this bias and also three d</v>
<v Speaker 2>printing and vinyl,</v>

1237
00:54:12.640 --> 00:54:16.370
<v Speaker 2>not the solution to poaching crisis</v>
<v Speaker 2>experts say,</v>

1238
00:54:16.990 --> 00:54:19.290
<v Speaker 2>I agree that that's the best way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1239
00:54:19.291 --> 00:54:20.760
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it's the best way</v>
<v Speaker 2>either.</v>

1240
00:54:20.790 --> 00:54:24.570
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just can't imagine that the rhinos are</v>

1241
00:54:24.571 --> 00:54:27.450
<v Speaker 2>literally on the verge of going extinct</v>
<v Speaker 2>because people want to kill them and</v>

1242
00:54:27.451 --> 00:54:30.610
<v Speaker 2>take their horns,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which do nothing and it's.</v>

1243
00:54:30.700 --> 00:54:33.600
<v Speaker 2>Isn't it like the same substances like a</v>
<v Speaker 2>fingernail or toenail?</v>

1244
00:54:34.140 --> 00:54:35.190
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

1245
00:54:35.280 --> 00:54:36.900
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like hair.</v>

1246
00:54:37.510 --> 00:54:38.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>

1247
00:54:38.250 --> 00:54:42.810
<v Speaker 2>But they have this erroneous idea that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you eat it and it makes your dick hard.</v>

1248
00:54:46.350 --> 00:54:51.350
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck is going on with Asia?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a broad statement and that's why</v>

1249
00:54:51.720 --> 00:54:53.110
<v Speaker 2>I bought it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I generalize,</v>

1250
00:54:53.200 --> 00:54:56.420
<v Speaker 2>generalize that a billion people folks</v>
<v Speaker 2>going on with Asian move.</v>

1251
00:54:56.960 --> 00:54:59.850
<v Speaker 2>I mean I wonder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's also a status symbol.</v>

1252
00:54:59.851 --> 00:55:04.851
<v Speaker 2>I was reading that even though it might</v>
<v Speaker 2>not necessarily be real or really work,</v>

1253
00:55:06.510 --> 00:55:11.510
<v Speaker 2>but it's such an ancient cultural status</v>
<v Speaker 2>symbol thing that like these businessmen</v>

1254
00:55:12.361 --> 00:55:14.830
<v Speaker 2>will get together and they'll have like</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rhino Horn tea,</v>

1255
00:55:15.680 --> 00:55:16.513
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they.</v>

1256
00:55:16.770 --> 00:55:21.270
<v Speaker 2>But they think it's cool because it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>illegal and you can't get it and it's</v>

1257
00:55:21.271 --> 00:55:24.900
<v Speaker 2>dangerous and it's got to come from</v>
<v Speaker 2>Africa and so it must really work.</v>

1258
00:55:26.670 --> 00:55:29.400
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe that's what they think though.</v>

1259
00:55:29.450 --> 00:55:33.550
<v Speaker 2>If favorite things work this expensive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe it doesn't matter their their</v>

1260
00:55:33.560 --> 00:55:35.440
<v Speaker 2>grandfathers said it worked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His grandfather said it work.</v>

1261
00:55:35.460 --> 00:55:36.480
<v Speaker 2>Why don't you google that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jamie?</v>

1262
00:55:36.510 --> 00:55:39.060
<v Speaker 2>Does Rhino Horn actually work?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1263
00:55:39.550 --> 00:55:42.210
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean maybe it doesn't work as good as</v>

1264
00:55:42.211 --> 00:55:44.370
<v Speaker 2>other stuff for fingernails.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does that ever does.</v>

1265
00:55:44.950 --> 00:55:46.530
<v Speaker 2>You just got to need eat enough</v>
<v Speaker 2>fingernails.</v>

1266
00:55:47.580 --> 00:55:52.580
<v Speaker 2>Imagine</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's an acceptable source to find?</v>

1267
00:55:55.970 --> 00:55:57.720
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there wouldn't be one from</v>
<v Speaker 2>China.</v>

1268
00:55:58.770 --> 00:56:00.720
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that funny?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you have to find a website that you</v>

1269
00:56:00.721 --> 00:56:01.650
<v Speaker 2>trust,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1270
00:56:01.940 --> 00:56:06.940
<v Speaker 2>It's got to be like wired.com or story</v>
<v Speaker 2>on factor fiction use on it,</v>

1271
00:56:07.111 --> 00:56:08.790
<v Speaker 2>but what does it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does that say?</v>

1272
00:56:08.820 --> 00:56:11.420
<v Speaker 2>PBS is probably valid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of information.</v>

1273
00:56:11.510 --> 00:56:15.870
<v Speaker 2>I'd have to read first,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just one article about Rhino Horn</v>

1274
00:56:15.871 --> 00:56:17.940
<v Speaker 2>use fact or fiction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always,</v>

1275
00:56:18.340 --> 00:56:20.310
<v Speaker 2>when I'm exhausted and I look at</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that,</v>

1276
00:56:20.311 --> 00:56:23.100
<v Speaker 2>I go to the very bottom and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hmm,</v>

1277
00:56:23.110 --> 00:56:27.150
<v Speaker 2>how do they wrap this up?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Overall not much evidence to support the</v>

1278
00:56:27.650 --> 00:56:29.530
<v Speaker 2>claim to what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The healing properties of the horns.</v>

1279
00:56:29.531 --> 00:56:31.480
<v Speaker 2>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a good little tip I just learned</v>

1280
00:56:31.481 --> 00:56:32.740
<v Speaker 2>from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're not really.</v>

1281
00:56:33.290 --> 00:56:36.370
<v Speaker 2>This isn't life dependent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is not something that you really.</v>

1282
00:56:36.810 --> 00:56:41.080
<v Speaker 2>It's not really a factor in your life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just go to the bottom line.</v>

1283
00:56:41.610 --> 00:56:43.530
<v Speaker 2>It is very strange.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1284
00:56:43.600 --> 00:56:46.570
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not believed as once believed.</v>

1285
00:56:46.690 --> 00:56:49.660
<v Speaker 2>It's not as once believed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rather made simply from a clump of</v>

1286
00:56:49.661 --> 00:56:53.560
<v Speaker 2>compressed or modified here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>recent studies by researchers and Ohio</v>

1287
00:56:53.560 --> 00:56:54.580
<v Speaker 2>University,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whole Ohio.</v>

1288
00:56:54.581 --> 00:56:56.680
<v Speaker 2>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Using computerize.</v>

1289
00:56:57.610 --> 00:57:01.900
<v Speaker 2>What does that Word Tomography?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ct Scans have shown that the horns are</v>

1290
00:57:01.901 --> 00:57:04.510
<v Speaker 2>in fact similar in structure to horses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hooves,</v>

1291
00:57:04.750 --> 00:57:09.540
<v Speaker 2>turtle beaks and cockatoo bills.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The studies also revealed at the centers</v>

1292
00:57:09.541 --> 00:57:14.541
<v Speaker 2>of the horns have dense mineral deposits</v>
<v Speaker 2>of calcium and Melanin of finding that</v>

1293
00:57:15.611 --> 00:57:19.480
<v Speaker 2>may explain the curve and shape sharp</v>
<v Speaker 2>tip of the horn.</v>

1294
00:57:19.481 --> 00:57:22.930
<v Speaker 2>The calcium would strengthen the horn</v>
<v Speaker 2>while the melanin would protect some of</v>

1295
00:57:22.931 --> 00:57:26.680
<v Speaker 2>the core from being degradated by</v>
<v Speaker 2>ultraviolet radiation from the Sun,</v>

1296
00:57:27.070 --> 00:57:31.660
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Softer outer portion worn away over time</v>

1297
00:57:32.050 --> 00:57:36.070
<v Speaker 2>by the sun and typical rhino activities</v>
<v Speaker 2>bashing horns with other animals rubbing</v>

1298
00:57:36.071 --> 00:57:38.800
<v Speaker 2>on the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The inner core would be sharpened into a</v>

1299
00:57:38.801 --> 00:57:40.630
<v Speaker 2>point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>much like a wooden pencil.</v>

1300
00:57:41.590 --> 00:57:45.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were in the horn that this kid was</v>

1301
00:57:45.411 --> 00:57:47.180
<v Speaker 1>basically trying to sell it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was like 15,</v>

1302
00:57:47.181 --> 00:57:49.540
<v Speaker 1>16 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His Dad was the poacher and uh,</v>

1303
00:57:49.850 --> 00:57:51.740
<v Speaker 1>his dad didn't want to get arrested so</v>
<v Speaker 1>he sends his kid,</v>

1304
00:57:52.250 --> 00:57:53.130
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

1305
00:57:53.210 --> 00:57:58.210
<v Speaker 1>it had all sorts of like us deep deeply</v>
<v Speaker 1>scratches inside of it and stuff and are</v>

1306
00:57:58.281 --> 00:58:01.160
<v Speaker 1>just all over Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The top was nicked up and stuff.</v>

1307
00:58:01.490 --> 00:58:05.270
<v Speaker 2>University of Hong Kong found that large</v>
<v Speaker 2>doses of Rhino Horn extract could</v>

1308
00:58:05.271 --> 00:58:10.271
<v Speaker 2>slightly lower fever in rats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagine if Rhino Horn was a cure to</v>

1309
00:58:10.641 --> 00:58:14.650
<v Speaker 2>malaria when we would start breeding</v>
<v Speaker 2>them right for like we do with chickens.</v>

1310
00:58:14.651 --> 00:58:19.651
<v Speaker 2>And how strange it just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1311
00:58:20.060 --> 00:58:23.090
<v Speaker 2>obviously it's not happening in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>western world.</v>

1312
00:58:23.120 --> 00:58:27.290
<v Speaker 2>It's not happening here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it could I guess.</v>

1313
00:58:27.740 --> 00:58:30.770
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean some people are just fucked up.</v>

1314
00:58:31.100 --> 00:58:33.020
<v Speaker 2>Some people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't care if something's about to</v>

1315
00:58:33.021 --> 00:58:34.580
<v Speaker 2>go extinct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just want,</v>

1316
00:58:35.120 --> 00:58:38.480
<v Speaker 2>they want what they want and if they</v>
<v Speaker 2>want that Rhino Horn for whatever</v>

1317
00:58:38.481 --> 00:58:39.830
<v Speaker 2>strange reason,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just.</v>

1318
00:58:41.130 --> 00:58:41.641
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well it's like,</v>

1319
00:58:41.641 --> 00:58:44.350
<v Speaker 1>it's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like kind of with the trees,</v>

1320
00:58:45.330 --> 00:58:47.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were getting ready to replant.</v>

1321
00:58:47.671 --> 00:58:51.260
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's 1000 more trees which would</v>

1322
00:58:51.270 --> 00:58:56.270
<v Speaker 1>take her total up the $4,500 on the land</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the pygmies and around there,</v>

1323
00:58:56.701 --> 00:58:59.100
<v Speaker 1>the reason that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean China and all these other places</v>

1324
00:58:59.101 --> 00:59:01.050
<v Speaker 1>are coming in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're cutting down the rear hardwoods,</v>

1325
00:59:01.051 --> 00:59:04.070
<v Speaker 1>the Mahogany and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and reason king leopold went,</v>

1326
00:59:04.080 --> 00:59:06.450
<v Speaker 1>there was the rubber boom and the trees</v>
<v Speaker 1>there and everything else.</v>

1327
00:59:06.900 --> 00:59:07.750
<v Speaker 1>But then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1328
00:59:08.630 --> 00:59:10.470
<v Speaker 1>it's just nuts to me because I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

1329
00:59:10.620 --> 00:59:12.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want it for greed,</v>

1330
00:59:12.540 --> 00:59:13.560
<v Speaker 1>money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything else.</v>

1331
00:59:13.561 --> 00:59:17.270
<v Speaker 1>But then the people in the country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're starting to,</v>

1332
00:59:17.380 --> 00:59:18.390
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to learning,</v>

1333
00:59:18.450 --> 00:59:20.040
<v Speaker 1>get educated in the fact that like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

1334
00:59:20.200 --> 00:59:22.520
<v Speaker 1>if we're cutting down all these trees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we better start replanting some because</v>

1335
00:59:22.521 --> 00:59:25.160
<v Speaker 1>it takes so long for them to grow back.</v>

1336
00:59:25.550 --> 00:59:26.383
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1337
00:59:26.650 --> 00:59:28.310
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's just for charcoal or fire and</v>

1338
00:59:28.311 --> 00:59:30.470
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once that's gone,</v>

1339
00:59:30.471 --> 00:59:32.250
<v Speaker 1>what do you have?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And yeah,</v>

1340
00:59:32.510 --> 00:59:37.080
<v Speaker 1>Booney actually the town that all of our</v>
<v Speaker 1>well drillers live in.</v>

1341
00:59:37.090 --> 00:59:38.720
<v Speaker 1>And at the university they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1342
00:59:39.140 --> 00:59:42.230
<v Speaker 1>they used to be in a rainforest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now you have to drive three,</v>

1343
00:59:42.231 --> 00:59:47.210
<v Speaker 1>four hours to get to the closest florist</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to drive three or four hours</v>

1344
00:59:47.270 --> 00:59:49.640
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it used to be in the center of the</v>

1345
00:59:49.840 --> 00:59:52.300
<v Speaker 1>center of the reinforced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the edge of the reinforced almost to</v>

1346
00:59:52.301 --> 00:59:55.070
<v Speaker 1>be a forest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's not three or four hours</v>

1347
00:59:55.071 --> 00:59:55.970
<v Speaker 1>drive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1348
00:59:56.260 --> 00:59:59.840
<v Speaker 1>it's all just because of deforestation</v>
<v Speaker 1>all chopping down for logging.</v>

1349
01:00:00.800 --> 01:00:02.600
<v Speaker 1>Fuck man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in Canada.</v>

1350
01:00:02.601 --> 01:00:03.480
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1351
01:00:03.530 --> 01:00:06.050
<v Speaker 1>they do a pretty good job of regulating</v>
<v Speaker 1>it and BC.</v>

1352
01:00:06.320 --> 01:00:09.320
<v Speaker 1>But it's still disturbing because you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you come across these,</v>

1353
01:00:09.350 --> 01:00:13.100
<v Speaker 1>these big gigantic fields where the</v>
<v Speaker 1>trees are just gone.</v>

1354
01:00:13.640 --> 01:00:18.600
<v Speaker 1>All the trees had been cut and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they plant som and they have the,</v>

1355
01:00:18.630 --> 01:00:23.240
<v Speaker 1>they also have like purchase,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they leave purchase for animals,</v>

1356
01:00:23.660 --> 01:00:24.620
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1357
01:00:24.740 --> 01:00:29.300
<v Speaker 1>probably like an awesome spot for like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>hawk or an eagle or something like that</v>

1358
01:00:29.600 --> 01:00:32.900
<v Speaker 1>because everything's cut down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can see every street to the press.</v>

1359
01:00:33.230 --> 01:00:34.130
<v Speaker 1>But it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1360
01:00:34.220 --> 01:00:36.800
<v Speaker 1>these cut out of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forget what they call it,</v>

1361
01:00:36.860 --> 01:00:39.230
<v Speaker 1>these patches where everything's cut</v>
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

1362
01:00:39.231 --> 01:00:42.110
<v Speaker 1>It's so disturbing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like I get,</v>

1363
01:00:42.170 --> 01:00:44.780
<v Speaker 1>I get that they replant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get that they have a cycle.</v>

1364
01:00:44.781 --> 01:00:47.690
<v Speaker 1>I get that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it just bugs me that people could do</v>

1365
01:00:47.691 --> 01:00:48.524
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just.</v>

1366
01:00:48.710 --> 01:00:53.710
<v Speaker 1>Giant swaths of the landscapes shaved</v>
<v Speaker 1>off and turned into toothpicks or</v>

1367
01:00:53.961 --> 01:00:55.940
<v Speaker 1>whatever the fuck they do with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1368
01:00:55.970 --> 01:01:00.970
<v Speaker 1>And so I was in a village before my</v>
<v Speaker 1>wife's first time to Congo and it was,</v>

1369
01:01:03.380 --> 01:01:05.030
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was almost like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1370
01:01:05.090 --> 01:01:08.540
<v Speaker 1>lush,</v>
<v Speaker 1>untouched virgin forest and then all of</v>

1371
01:01:08.541 --> 01:01:12.110
<v Speaker 1>a sudden a come back next time with her</v>
<v Speaker 1>coming in with worse,</v>

1372
01:01:12.111 --> 01:01:12.920
<v Speaker 1>come back in.</v>

1373
01:01:12.920 --> 01:01:16.370
<v Speaker 1>It's probably a month or so because we</v>
<v Speaker 1>went to a couple of other villages,</v>

1374
01:01:16.450 --> 01:01:18.810
<v Speaker 1>go back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>start going to the same hike and all of</v>

1375
01:01:18.811 --> 01:01:22.100
<v Speaker 1>a sudden there's this huge clearing at</v>
<v Speaker 1>least 10 acres,</v>

1376
01:01:22.101 --> 01:01:26.420
<v Speaker 1>probably 20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>25 and it was just nothing there except</v>

1377
01:01:26.421 --> 01:01:30.500
<v Speaker 1>for a few remaining huge cut down trees</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I could stand in front of and the,</v>

1378
01:01:30.940 --> 01:01:33.240
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the base or whatever it was way</v>

1379
01:01:33.330 --> 01:01:37.040
<v Speaker 1>telling them I was a little midget next</v>
<v Speaker 1>to that or fuck man.</v>

1380
01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:38.570
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty crazy.</v>

1381
01:01:38.680 --> 01:01:39.610
<v Speaker 1>And I was telling her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1382
01:01:39.620 --> 01:01:41.570
<v Speaker 1>baby,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when I was like,</v>

1383
01:01:41.571 --> 01:01:44.180
<v Speaker 1>take some picture of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I have some pictures right here</v>

1384
01:01:44.300 --> 01:01:46.580
<v Speaker 1>of where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where we are right now on this trail.</v>

1385
01:01:46.581 --> 01:01:50.750
<v Speaker 1>And like there used to be trees here and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was nuts because all of a sudden for</v>

1386
01:01:50.751 --> 01:01:52.940
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I'm in the rain forest is great</v>

1387
01:01:52.941 --> 01:01:54.860
<v Speaker 1>actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's hot in a malaria,</v>

1388
01:01:54.950 --> 01:01:56.930
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

1389
01:01:56.960 --> 01:02:00.020
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her but being under the canopy of the</v>

1390
01:02:00.021 --> 01:02:02.120
<v Speaker 1>rain forest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to love that because it's shaded</v>

1391
01:02:02.121 --> 01:02:04.100
<v Speaker 1>and everything else still hot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>still humid,</v>

1392
01:02:04.750 --> 01:02:07.590
<v Speaker 1>but a little bit better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not getting burned on,</v>

1393
01:02:07.810 --> 01:02:08.511
<v Speaker 1>especially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1394
01:02:08.511 --> 01:02:10.930
<v Speaker 1>you're really pale in on the hike.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was getting burned and I'm like,</v>

1395
01:02:10.940 --> 01:02:11.773
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a nuts.</v>

1396
01:02:11.790 --> 01:02:13.900
<v Speaker 1>Especially on that malaria medication.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1397
01:02:13.940 --> 01:02:15.210
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1398
01:02:15.250 --> 01:02:17.420
<v Speaker 1>that they were talking on this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1399
01:02:17.510 --> 01:02:19.980
<v Speaker 1>documentary I was watching about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>deforestation</v>

1400
01:02:19.980 --> 01:02:22.980
<v Speaker 2>of the Amazon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about how fast it's happening and how</v>

1401
01:02:22.981 --> 01:02:26.670
<v Speaker 2>terrifying it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And a big part of it I guess is not</v>

1402
01:02:26.671 --> 01:02:27.990
<v Speaker 2>even.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well there's logging,</v>

1403
01:02:27.991 --> 01:02:31.170
<v Speaker 2>but there's also they cut it down to</v>
<v Speaker 2>make room for cattle grazing.</v>

1404
01:02:31.950 --> 01:02:36.950
<v Speaker 2>And when they were showing the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just the sheer size of the deforestation</v>

1405
01:02:38.011 --> 01:02:43.011
<v Speaker 2>of how much they've done in so quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I'm also the people that live</v>

1406
01:02:43.740 --> 01:02:48.110
<v Speaker 2>in these areas where if they resist the</v>
<v Speaker 2>loggers or they're resist it,</v>

1407
01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:52.020
<v Speaker 2>skip murdered,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially the indigenous people that</v>

1408
01:02:52.021 --> 01:02:56.090
<v Speaker 2>are more out there and it happens with</v>
<v Speaker 2>the pygmies because they are the weaker</v>

1409
01:02:56.091 --> 01:02:59.310
<v Speaker 2>and more vulnerable things that can push</v>
<v Speaker 2>around and they can't push back.</v>

1410
01:02:59.360 --> 01:03:03.290
<v Speaker 2>And so when you consider your life and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you consider this horrible,</v>

1411
01:03:03.291 --> 01:03:04.980
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these stories that you're telling us</v>

1412
01:03:04.981 --> 01:03:07.440
<v Speaker 2>about your upbringing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how disturbing it is,</v>

1413
01:03:08.740 --> 01:03:12.210
<v Speaker 2>does it feel to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>since you've found this like sense of</v>

1414
01:03:12.211 --> 01:03:13.620
<v Speaker 2>purpose in this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1415
01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:18.630
<v Speaker 2>this real connection with these people</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the Congo that almost like these</v>

1416
01:03:18.631 --> 01:03:22.650
<v Speaker 2>horrible events in your life or setting</v>
<v Speaker 2>you up to be the perfect person to find</v>

1417
01:03:22.651 --> 01:03:23.484
<v Speaker 2>these folks?</v>

1418
01:03:24.030 --> 01:03:25.110
<v Speaker 2>Without a doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For me,</v>

1419
01:03:25.111 --> 01:03:26.010
<v Speaker 2>honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1420
01:03:26.600 --> 01:03:29.700
<v Speaker 2>it's almost like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the right word.</v>

1421
01:03:30.660 --> 01:03:34.110
<v Speaker 2>Maybe maybe sort of my chance at kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>redemption or,</v>

1422
01:03:34.170 --> 01:03:37.170
<v Speaker 2>or just not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not being the kid that I grew up being.</v>

1423
01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:41.350
<v Speaker 2>Not that was a bad kid or anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just I hated myself and like,</v>

1424
01:03:41.360 --> 01:03:44.100
<v Speaker 2>you know what I get to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he just stopped hating myself.</v>

1425
01:03:44.140 --> 01:03:46.920
<v Speaker 2>I need to stop and I get to start loving</v>
<v Speaker 2>others.</v>

1426
01:03:47.260 --> 01:03:48.180
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just that,</v>

1427
01:03:48.181 --> 01:03:50.400
<v Speaker 2>you also have this massive impact on</v>
<v Speaker 2>other people.</v>

1428
01:03:50.401 --> 01:03:53.010
<v Speaker 2>You have all these people that love you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have this amazing wife.</v>

1429
01:03:53.011 --> 01:03:56.790
<v Speaker 2>Now you have this amazing pygmy family.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have your regular family.</v>

1430
01:03:56.791 --> 01:03:57.820
<v Speaker 2>To me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>

1431
01:03:57.840 --> 01:04:01.500
<v Speaker 2>you have so much positive going on now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really kind of incredible.</v>

1432
01:04:01.501 --> 01:04:06.501
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like you are the horrible</v>
<v Speaker 2>experiences you had as a young kid have</v>

1433
01:04:07.950 --> 01:04:11.700
<v Speaker 2>sort of made you into this incredible</v>
<v Speaker 2>adult.</v>

1434
01:04:12.420 --> 01:04:14.400
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I don't know about that because</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know how this.</v>

1436
01:04:23.640 --> 01:04:26.630
<v Speaker 2>Honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

1437
01:04:27.100 --> 01:04:32.100
<v Speaker 2>there's not a good explanation that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>could probably explain that like it</v>

1438
01:04:32.701 --> 01:04:37.140
<v Speaker 2>should be working or that it's working</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it is because it will with me at</v>

1439
01:04:37.141 --> 01:04:40.690
<v Speaker 2>the front of it because I don't have any</v>
<v Speaker 2>community development training or would</v>

1481
01:06:21.071 --> 01:06:24.670
<v Speaker 1>first couple of times and I realized</v>
<v Speaker 1>just how impractical they are and in a</v>

1482
01:06:24.671 --> 01:06:27.130
<v Speaker 1>real longterm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not at,</v>

1483
01:06:27.160 --> 01:06:29.710
<v Speaker 1>not a day hike or three day weekend or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's just like a certain type of</v>

1489
01:06:41.921 --> 01:06:43.570
<v Speaker 1>plastic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's really hard.</v>

1490
01:06:44.110 --> 01:06:45.690
<v Speaker 1>Durable plastic that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1492
01:06:48.290 --> 01:06:53.050
<v Speaker 1>that's what I would rather because the</v>
<v Speaker 1>other ones too already clean and yeah,</v>

1493
01:06:53.240 --> 01:06:55.630
<v Speaker 1>sort to fill up just all sorts of stuff.</v>

1494
01:06:55.870 --> 01:06:57.790
<v Speaker 1>But some people like it because they</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>

1495
01:06:57.850 --> 01:07:00.400
<v Speaker 1>they don't have to stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can just keep walking and just suck</v>

1496
01:07:00.401 --> 01:07:03.700
<v Speaker 1>on that thing as they're walking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never used one though.</v>

1497
01:07:03.750 --> 01:07:05.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used it for the first two times I</v>

1498
01:07:05.891 --> 01:07:07.150
<v Speaker 1>went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was like a,</v>

1499
01:07:07.420 --> 01:07:10.390
<v Speaker 1>about a month each.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you switched to water bottles?</v>

1500
01:07:10.600 --> 01:07:11.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then even the,</v>

1501
01:07:11.810 --> 01:07:16.090
<v Speaker 1>they have those camelback kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they're called like a platypus</v>

1502
01:07:16.091 --> 01:07:20.230
<v Speaker 1>or something that's um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a gravity filter for water where</v>

1503
01:07:20.290 --> 01:07:24.850
<v Speaker 1>you have a dirty water bagging.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If a clean the dirty hang,</v>

1504
01:07:25.060 --> 01:07:27.880
<v Speaker 1>hang the dirty and it goes down through</v>
<v Speaker 1>a filter and into the clean bag.</v>

1505
01:07:27.920 --> 01:07:29.260
<v Speaker 1>I've seen that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>

1506
01:07:29.410 --> 01:07:30.243
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Posed.</v>

1507
01:07:30.460 --> 01:07:32.200
<v Speaker 1>See if you could find that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does that work?</v>

1508
01:07:32.230 --> 01:07:36.520
<v Speaker 1>Those are the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they work great here in the</v>

1509
01:07:36.521 --> 01:07:39.240
<v Speaker 1>states where you're not dealing with</v>
<v Speaker 1>much.</v>

1510
01:07:39.400 --> 01:07:42.580
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But whenever the water is dirty,</v>

1511
01:07:42.581 --> 01:07:46.300
<v Speaker 1>like really dirty it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they break pretty quick so you have to</v>

1512
01:07:46.570 --> 01:07:47.560
<v Speaker 1>backwash from and other.</v>

1513
01:07:47.610 --> 01:07:49.600
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some that are that are good,</v>

1514
01:07:49.601 --> 01:07:51.310
<v Speaker 1>but even the maintenance of them just</v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

1515
01:07:51.970 --> 01:07:55.600
<v Speaker 1>really tough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they work for like one filtration but</v>

1516
01:07:55.601 --> 01:07:59.800
<v Speaker 1>they won't work the first time I went</v>
<v Speaker 1>for about a month,</v>

1517
01:07:59.890 --> 01:08:04.890
<v Speaker 1>I had it for a week or two and then all</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a sudden it was heartbreaking because</v>

1518
01:08:05.890 --> 01:08:07.780
<v Speaker 1>I was even filtering the water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1519
01:08:07.990 --> 01:08:10.600
<v Speaker 1>in the town that's coming from wells</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I don't know if they,</v>

1520
01:08:11.860 --> 01:08:14.970
<v Speaker 1>if they did it properly right when they</v>
<v Speaker 1>call and,</v>

1521
01:08:15.040 --> 01:08:16.280
<v Speaker 1>and I had been sick enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1522
01:08:16.430 --> 01:08:17.510
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hear Ya.</v>

1523
01:08:17.540 --> 01:08:20.510
<v Speaker 1>So I'm filtering that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then by the time I get out to the</v>

1524
01:08:20.511 --> 01:08:23.990
<v Speaker 1>forest I was able to use a few days and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it was out in the sun was stuck</v>

1525
01:08:23.991 --> 01:08:26.680
<v Speaker 1>with just chlorine tablets the rest of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>

1526
01:08:27.790 --> 01:08:29.070
<v Speaker 1>And you can boil it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

1527
01:08:29.190 --> 01:08:32.240
<v Speaker 1>it's just impractical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where every single time you want to</v>

1528
01:08:32.330 --> 01:08:33.770
<v Speaker 1>drink,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you take,</v>

1529
01:08:33.771 --> 01:08:34.890
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1530
01:08:35.150 --> 01:08:37.610
<v Speaker 1>take a container down to dirty water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which could be 30,</v>

1531
01:08:37.611 --> 01:08:38.630
<v Speaker 1>45 minutes away.</v>

1532
01:08:39.290 --> 01:08:41.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm bringing it back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boil it,</v>

1533
01:08:41.660 --> 01:08:42.590
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bring it back,</v>

1534
01:08:42.591 --> 01:08:44.630
<v Speaker 1>boil it a filter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1535
01:08:44.631 --> 01:08:45.560
<v Speaker 1>And then all of a sudden,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the,</v>

1536
01:08:46.110 --> 01:08:49.780
<v Speaker 1>the ashes getting in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it's the hot humid rainforest</v>

1537
01:08:49.850 --> 01:08:53.840
<v Speaker 1>on the equator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And boiling water doesn't cool down</v>

1538
01:08:54.530 --> 01:08:56.510
<v Speaker 1>basically ever there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1539
01:08:56.511 --> 01:08:57.620
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1540
01:08:57.680 --> 01:08:59.570
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's impractical to do it that way.</v>

1541
01:08:59.840 --> 01:09:01.520
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what I love now is,</v>

1542
01:09:01.550 --> 01:09:02.320
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1543
01:09:02.320 --> 01:09:04.850
<v Speaker 1>it's guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's do it.</v>

1544
01:09:05.330 --> 01:09:07.010
<v Speaker 1>So this is this girl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

1545
01:09:07.011 --> 01:09:09.260
<v Speaker 1>she's way too hot to be in this video is</v>
<v Speaker 1>very distracting.</v>

1546
01:09:09.740 --> 01:09:10.310
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1547
01:09:10.310 --> 01:09:14.120
<v Speaker 1>they're gonna take this in what looks</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a very clean stream.</v>

1548
01:09:14.480 --> 01:09:16.490
<v Speaker 1>So this is so much different than when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

1549
01:09:16.700 --> 01:09:19.280
<v Speaker 1>But people should also be aware that</v>
<v Speaker 1>clean streams,</v>

1550
01:09:19.281 --> 01:09:22.830
<v Speaker 1>although they may look clean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can still get Giardia from them yet</v>

1551
01:09:22.900 --> 01:09:24.770
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly what I learned from,</v>

1552
01:09:24.771 --> 01:09:26.460
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his name is buddy of mine.</v>

1553
01:09:26.470 --> 01:09:27.303
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Matt,</v>

1554
01:09:27.410 --> 01:09:31.250
<v Speaker 1>he was the director of implementation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now he's like the chief operating</v>

1555
01:09:31.251 --> 01:09:33.200
<v Speaker 1>officer and he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1556
01:09:33.680 --> 01:09:37.790
<v Speaker 1>he came out there and one of the things</v>
<v Speaker 1>he really drilled into us for a well</v>

1557
01:09:37.791 --> 01:09:39.350
<v Speaker 1>drilling team.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're learning from a great guy.</v>

1558
01:09:39.920 --> 01:09:40.610
<v Speaker 1>He's saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

1559
01:09:40.610 --> 01:09:41.443
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1560
01:09:42.260 --> 01:09:47.260
<v Speaker 1>you can drill 100 wells or 200 wells,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you didn't do it right and proper</v>

1561
01:09:48.350 --> 01:09:51.470
<v Speaker 1>that I would have rather done one the</v>
<v Speaker 1>right way or none,</v>

1562
01:09:51.620 --> 01:09:54.950
<v Speaker 1>none.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you do it the right or the wrong way</v>

1563
01:09:54.951 --> 01:09:56.270
<v Speaker 1>100 times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>200 times,</v>

1564
01:09:56.790 --> 01:09:59.120
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you are giving a village.</v>

1565
01:09:59.480 --> 01:10:01.820
<v Speaker 1>Like he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he just hit home hard because he's like,</v>

1566
01:10:01.821 --> 01:10:03.740
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're learning every single step.</v>

1567
01:10:03.741 --> 01:10:06.140
<v Speaker 1>You can't skip one week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Got a drill us anywhere,</v>

1568
01:10:06.141 --> 01:10:07.490
<v Speaker 1>you know it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1569
01:10:07.850 --> 01:10:11.480
<v Speaker 1>because we can't skip a step or miss</v>
<v Speaker 1>something and then all of a sudden they</v>

1570
01:10:11.481 --> 01:10:13.340
<v Speaker 1>are looking at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>drinking it.</v>

1571
01:10:13.430 --> 01:10:15.130
<v Speaker 1>It tastes good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

1572
01:10:15.170 --> 01:10:16.100
<v Speaker 1>it's clean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's cool,</v>

1573
01:10:16.101 --> 01:10:17.600
<v Speaker 1>it's crisp,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's in a well,</v>

1574
01:10:17.900 --> 01:10:21.140
<v Speaker 1>but yet it can still still be</v>
<v Speaker 1>contaminated,</v>

1575
01:10:21.141 --> 01:10:22.700
<v Speaker 1>dirty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so get real sick if you don't</v>

1576
01:10:22.701 --> 01:10:26.660
<v Speaker 1>properly construct well no matter what.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it is the wells here anywhere.</v>

1577
01:10:26.720 --> 01:10:28.910
<v Speaker 1>What is the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are the factors like when you say</v>

1578
01:10:28.930 --> 01:10:31.640
<v Speaker 1>product properly construct,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what are the issues that you have</v>

1579
01:10:31.641 --> 01:10:32.930
<v Speaker 1>to avoid?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

1580
01:10:32.950 --> 01:10:36.790
<v Speaker 1>we man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our teams getting great.</v>

1581
01:10:36.791 --> 01:10:37.670
<v Speaker 1>But by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>real quick,</v>

1582
01:10:37.671 --> 01:10:40.880
<v Speaker 1>last time I was on the show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we had completed 20 water wells.</v>

1583
01:10:41.200 --> 01:10:44.690
<v Speaker 1>I went back and looked at that 20 water</v>
<v Speaker 1>wells today.</v>

1584
01:10:45.110 --> 01:10:48.870
<v Speaker 1>I got a picture sent to me and it's our</v>
<v Speaker 1>45th water.</v>

1585
01:10:48.910 --> 01:10:51.410
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's incredible dude.</v>

1586
01:10:51.411 --> 01:10:53.310
<v Speaker 1>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely love it.</v>

1587
01:10:53.311 --> 01:10:55.790
<v Speaker 1>And so what's so great is seeing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1588
01:10:55.791 --> 01:10:56.900
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

1589
01:10:57.650 --> 01:11:00.460
<v Speaker 1>they're taking this on as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as their own thing,</v>

1590
01:11:00.530 --> 01:11:01.670
<v Speaker 1>flying on their own two wings.</v>

1591
01:11:01.670 --> 01:11:05.240
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were empowered in a way that's</v>

1592
01:11:05.241 --> 01:11:05.810
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1593
01:11:05.810 --> 01:11:07.430
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can do this,</v>

1594
01:11:07.970 --> 01:11:09.760
<v Speaker 1>you can do it for yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for your countrymen.</v>

1595
01:11:10.080 --> 01:11:12.440
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you guys are going to be more passionate</v>

1596
01:11:12.840 --> 01:11:16.290
<v Speaker 1>about ending the suffering because you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know the suffering because you have</v>

1597
01:11:16.291 --> 01:11:17.760
<v Speaker 1>suffered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've lost family members,</v>

1598
01:11:17.761 --> 01:11:20.880
<v Speaker 1>you have sick kids all at different</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

1599
01:11:20.881 --> 01:11:25.881
<v Speaker 1>And so they're going to be able to be a</v>
<v Speaker 1>better champion for this cause then I</v>

1600
01:11:26.221 --> 01:11:28.890
<v Speaker 1>could be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I mean maybe we have different</v>

1601
01:11:29.730 --> 01:11:31.690
<v Speaker 1>resources where I get to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1602
01:11:31.691 --> 01:11:34.620
<v Speaker 1>you share your platform with me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which has been incredible.</v>

1603
01:11:34.780 --> 01:11:37.920
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the kickstarter and the documentary</v>

1604
01:11:37.921 --> 01:11:40.680
<v Speaker 1>coming out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the different stuff is really great.</v>

1605
01:11:40.800 --> 01:11:41.633
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1606
01:11:41.670 --> 01:11:43.140
<v Speaker 1>but I know that the team,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>

01:12:29.490 --> 01:12:33.120
<v Speaker 1>Like it's a different kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a different kind of gratitude,</v>

1625
01:12:33.121 --> 01:12:37.980
<v Speaker 1>thankfulness when you suffered your</v>
<v Speaker 1>whole life and then you,</v>

1626
01:12:38.490 --> 01:12:42.420
<v Speaker 1>you get to partner with people in a non.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not even talking about me like our team,</v>

1627
01:12:42.870 --> 01:12:43.800
<v Speaker 1>our well drillers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1628
01:12:43.801 --> 01:12:46.350
<v Speaker 1>they see them coming in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>staying with them,</v>

1629
01:12:46.620 --> 01:12:48.690
<v Speaker 1>living like they're living,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eating like they're eating,</v>

1630
01:12:49.020 --> 01:12:51.690
<v Speaker 1>sitting around the campfire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they sit around which nobody else</v>

1631
01:12:51.691 --> 01:12:52.524
<v Speaker 1>does that with them.</v>

1632
01:12:52.680 --> 01:12:55.220
<v Speaker 1>And so sleeping in the Hudson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these sleep and um,</v>

1633
01:12:55.380 --> 01:12:58.440
<v Speaker 1>which nobody else would do a in that</v>
<v Speaker 1>area.</v>

1634
01:12:58.560 --> 01:13:02.070
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then like you just develop this bond</v>

1635
01:13:02.071 --> 01:13:05.430
<v Speaker 1>and really quickly and where all of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>sudden they're jumping in and helping</v>

1636
01:13:05.490 --> 01:13:08.040
<v Speaker 1>with the construction of the well and</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything else.</v>

1637
01:13:08.041 --> 01:13:10.650
<v Speaker 1>Now they do the simple daily routine</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

1638
01:13:10.651 --> 01:13:13.180
<v Speaker 1>Not the technical stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then yeah,</v>

1639
01:13:13.200 --> 01:13:15.390
<v Speaker 1>our guys are there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're getting to down,</v>

1640
01:13:15.391 --> 01:13:17.190
<v Speaker 1>which was pretty cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing though.</v>

1641
01:13:17.730 --> 01:13:20.530
<v Speaker 1>Now you're at 45 wells.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1642
01:13:20.880 --> 01:13:23.280
<v Speaker 1>And what is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you have an ultimate goal or would</v>

1643
01:13:23.281 --> 01:13:28.281
<v Speaker 1>you just like to continue?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the my ultimate goal lines up</v>

1644
01:13:28.501 --> 01:13:33.270
<v Speaker 1>with water for his ultimate goal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I love and then with our drillers</v>

1645
01:13:33.271 --> 01:13:36.690
<v Speaker 1>in Congo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like our goal is to end the water crisis</v>

1646
01:13:36.691 --> 01:13:40.500
<v Speaker 1>of possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We think it is possible and we have the</v>

1647
01:13:40.501 --> 01:13:42.150
<v Speaker 1>technology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We should be able to do it in our</v>

1648
01:13:42.151 --> 01:13:42.984
<v Speaker 1>lifetime.</v>

1649
01:13:43.410 --> 01:13:48.410
<v Speaker 1>Like before you were me past this earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we should have the technology to</v>

1650
01:13:48.511 --> 01:13:51.240
<v Speaker 1>get everyone clean water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it crazy shit that is,</v>

1651
01:13:51.300 --> 01:13:53.940
<v Speaker 1>that's our issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When when over here in America we have</v>

1652
01:13:53.941 --> 01:13:57.850
<v Speaker 1>so many trivial things that we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>constantly worrying about and fretting</v>

1653
01:13:57.870 --> 01:14:02.400
<v Speaker 1>when when they get down to basic human</v>
<v Speaker 1>necessities like water,</v>

1654
01:14:02.520 --> 01:14:06.030
<v Speaker 1>the ability to get clean water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is without that,</v>

1655
01:14:06.570 --> 01:14:08.670
<v Speaker 1>all the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the other things that we argue or</v>

1656
01:14:08.671 --> 01:14:09.990
<v Speaker 1>bicker about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're all.</v>

1657
01:14:10.020 --> 01:14:12.580
<v Speaker 1>It's all nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

1658
01:14:12.640 --> 01:14:15.070
<v Speaker 1>That's something that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh man,</v>

1659
01:14:15.250 --> 01:14:18.170
<v Speaker 1>that's something that I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I almost like,</v>

1660
01:14:18.250 --> 01:14:19.960
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get this crazy culture shock because I</v>

1661
01:14:19.961 --> 01:14:24.450
<v Speaker 1>feel like I'm in two different worlds</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when I'm there,</v>

1662
01:14:24.460 --> 01:14:27.070
<v Speaker 1>so I mean there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's uncomfortable,</v>

1663
01:14:27.071 --> 01:14:28.490
<v Speaker 1>but because I'm passionate about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1664
01:14:28.730 --> 01:14:31.750
<v Speaker 1>I enjoy it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then getting back here,</v>

1665
01:14:31.751 --> 01:14:32.650
<v Speaker 1>sometimes it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1666
01:14:32.651 --> 01:14:35.920
<v Speaker 1>like everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of times everything that we're</v>

1667
01:14:35.921 --> 01:14:37.210
<v Speaker 1>chasing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even me,</v>

1668
01:14:37.920 --> 01:14:41.650
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't really matter in the big</v>
<v Speaker 1>grand scheme of things,</v>

1669
01:14:41.690 --> 01:14:42.523
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how can we,</v>

1670
01:14:43.810 --> 01:14:47.500
<v Speaker 1>how can we get for ourselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how can we give to another person?</v>

1671
01:14:47.510 --> 01:14:48.700
<v Speaker 1>Because like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1672
01:14:48.701 --> 01:14:51.250
<v Speaker 1>it truly is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's better than I know you have to</v>

1673
01:14:51.251 --> 01:14:53.530
<v Speaker 1>take care of yourself so you can take</v>
<v Speaker 1>care of someone else.</v>

1674
01:14:53.620 --> 01:14:54.520
<v Speaker 1>Like I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get that.</v>

1675
01:14:55.290 --> 01:14:59.340
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just think it's kind of like this art</v>

1676
01:14:59.341 --> 01:15:03.430
<v Speaker 1>culture here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see kids and even adults,</v>

1677
01:15:04.060 --> 01:15:05.260
<v Speaker 1>that's mine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1678
01:15:05.290 --> 01:15:05.920
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

1679
01:15:05.920 --> 01:15:07.540
<v Speaker 1>that's our culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We say that's mine.</v>

1680
01:15:07.541 --> 01:15:08.410
<v Speaker 1>Give me that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's mine.</v>

1681
01:15:08.950 --> 01:15:10.690
<v Speaker 1>In Congo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if a,</v>

1682
01:15:10.990 --> 01:15:14.320
<v Speaker 1>if a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if a kid that had the eggs,</v>

1683
01:15:15.040 --> 01:15:18.310
<v Speaker 1>instead of having an egg,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if he had a bag of peanuts and he bought</v>

1684
01:15:18.311 --> 01:15:22.180
<v Speaker 1>it for himself and then I walked by</v>
<v Speaker 1>sitting down with them if a friend or</v>

1685
01:15:22.181 --> 01:15:25.360
<v Speaker 1>not even just introducing myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's gonna offer me his food.</v>

1686
01:15:25.690 --> 01:15:28.870
<v Speaker 1>He said instead of it's mine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's going to say you want some.</v>

1687
01:15:29.450 --> 01:15:32.060
<v Speaker 1>And so it's different in that culture</v>
<v Speaker 1>where it's not,</v>

1688
01:15:32.130 --> 01:15:35.410
<v Speaker 1>they don't have anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they'll give you everything that got</v>

1689
01:15:35.740 --> 01:15:36.610
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for instance,</v>

1690
01:15:36.940 --> 01:15:37.990
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1691
01:15:37.991 --> 01:15:39.640
<v Speaker 1>that knife last time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1692
01:15:39.980 --> 01:15:43.090
<v Speaker 1>that I was able to bring back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that chief Leo may made,</v>

1693
01:15:43.720 --> 01:15:44.560
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1694
01:15:44.561 --> 01:15:46.990
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he made a bow and Arrow and I'm actually</v>

1695
01:15:47.350 --> 01:15:47.950
<v Speaker 1>bringing that to you.</v>

1696
01:15:47.950 --> 01:15:52.090
<v Speaker 1>It was under our crawlspace and I lost</v>
<v Speaker 1>it when now everyone know where it is.</v>

1697
01:15:52.450 --> 01:15:54.370
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's pumped to bring that back to you.</v>

1698
01:15:54.371 --> 01:15:57.820
<v Speaker 1>But I mean for them to give that kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff away.</v>

1699
01:15:58.570 --> 01:16:02.980
<v Speaker 1>Whenever Leo May,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's the chief of his village and now</v>

1700
01:16:02.981 --> 01:16:04.930
<v Speaker 1>because he's got a job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he might have more.</v>

1701
01:16:04.931 --> 01:16:08.590
<v Speaker 1>But whenever I knew him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had maybe he was lucky if he had two</v>

1702
01:16:08.591 --> 01:16:11.980
<v Speaker 1>changes of clothes because most of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>pygmies have the clothes on their back.</v>

1703
01:16:12.430 --> 01:16:14.380
<v Speaker 1>They don't even have a blanket,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fires their blanket.</v>

1704
01:16:14.960 --> 01:16:19.510
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so it's just completely night and</v>

1705
01:16:19.511 --> 01:16:21.520
<v Speaker 1>day difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of people that listen to</v>

1706
01:16:21.521 --> 01:16:22.900
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that have gotten this far,</v>

1707
01:16:22.901 --> 01:16:24.310
<v Speaker 1>that want to figure out how they can</v>
<v Speaker 1>help.</v>

1721
01:17:04.721 --> 01:17:08.590
<v Speaker 1>which is kind of a city center,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe half less than half a million</v>

1722
01:17:08.590 --> 01:17:09.500
<v Speaker 1>people for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

1723
01:17:09.950 --> 01:17:11.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the city center where there's a</v>

1724
01:17:11.321 --> 01:17:13.250
<v Speaker 1>university,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a community development program</v>

1725
01:17:13.251 --> 01:17:18.251
<v Speaker 1>that's literally changing their part of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Congo by not waiting on the government</v>

1726
01:17:19.250 --> 01:17:23.360
<v Speaker 1>or by not waiting on an NGO,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they're just taking the initiative</v>

1727
01:17:23.361 --> 01:17:24.194
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>

1728
01:17:24.290 --> 01:17:29.290
<v Speaker 1>And so we've seen that they're so bought</v>
<v Speaker 1>in that whenever we presented an idea of</v>

1729
01:17:29.510 --> 01:17:34.510
<v Speaker 1>what if we could start a sustainable</v>
<v Speaker 1>solutions appropriate technology center</v>

1730
01:17:35.060 --> 01:17:38.810
<v Speaker 1>where there's land,</v>
<v Speaker 1>water and food solutions and then after</v>

1731
01:17:38.811 --> 01:17:41.330
<v Speaker 1>that maybe we can get into solar and</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe after that we can do this or that</v>

1732
01:17:41.331 --> 01:17:42.380
<v Speaker 1>or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

1733
01:17:42.381 --> 01:17:46.490
<v Speaker 1>But at that place will have different</v>
<v Speaker 1>stations where here's land,</v>

1734
01:17:46.491 --> 01:17:50.960
<v Speaker 1>you can come learn about land rights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to replant the trees,</v>

1735
01:17:51.260 --> 01:17:52.520
<v Speaker 1>the forestry aspect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1736
01:17:52.521 --> 01:17:55.100
<v Speaker 1>all that different stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ports of land and we have people</v>

1737
01:17:55.101 --> 01:17:56.960
<v Speaker 1>there that can help and show them</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

1738
01:17:57.020 --> 01:18:01.790
<v Speaker 1>If a chief wants to come in and book our</v>
<v Speaker 1>well drilling team for their community,</v>

1739
01:18:01.791 --> 01:18:02.930
<v Speaker 1>for their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can come in,</v>

1740
01:18:03.110 --> 01:18:04.730
<v Speaker 1>see how we do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why we do it,</v>

1741
01:18:05.330 --> 01:18:07.250
<v Speaker 1>everything about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We wouldn't have a little conference</v>

1742
01:18:07.251 --> 01:18:10.070
<v Speaker 1>room where we can train people up on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>wash program because now we're doing</v>

1743
01:18:10.071 --> 01:18:10.610
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1744
01:18:10.610 --> 01:18:12.260
<v Speaker 1>All the villages that we've drilled</v>
<v Speaker 1>wells in,</v>

1745
01:18:12.530 --> 01:18:14.930
<v Speaker 1>we're going back in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're doing the wash program,</v>

1746
01:18:14.931 --> 01:18:18.830
<v Speaker 1>water and sanitation and hygiene.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so with that,</v>

1747
01:18:18.920 --> 01:18:21.110
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you didn't have the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have outhouses,</v>

1748
01:18:21.290 --> 01:18:23.330
<v Speaker 1>what do they use for their.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Getting them there,</v>

1749
01:18:23.331 --> 01:18:24.470
<v Speaker 1>getting them now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

1750
01:18:24.471 --> 01:18:25.760
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the year I was there,</v>

1751
01:18:25.820 --> 01:18:29.270
<v Speaker 1>there was one or two of the 10 villages</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were in,</v>

1752
01:18:29.271 --> 01:18:33.560
<v Speaker 1>had a quote unquote latrine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was only like three or four feet</v>

1753
01:18:33.561 --> 01:18:34.394
<v Speaker 1>deep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which isn't,</v>

1754
01:18:34.610 --> 01:18:36.950
<v Speaker 1>isn't a safe some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of them are just going in the</v>

1755
01:18:36.951 --> 01:18:37.641
<v Speaker 1>woods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1756
01:18:37.641 --> 01:18:40.060
<v Speaker 1>And honestly like that's if.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1757
01:18:40.070 --> 01:18:44.150
<v Speaker 1>until you do it the right way with cars</v>
<v Speaker 1>outside of there,</v>

1758
01:18:44.151 --> 01:18:46.100
<v Speaker 1>some of those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of those latrines in the city's</v>

1759
01:18:46.430 --> 01:18:46.941
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1760
01:18:46.941 --> 01:18:50.450
<v Speaker 1>I definitely think I've gotten sick from</v>
<v Speaker 1>a fly that maybe waited there.</v>

1761
01:18:50.451 --> 01:18:51.284
<v Speaker 1>So I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

1762
01:18:51.830 --> 01:18:53.930
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

1763
01:18:53.931 --> 01:18:57.110
<v Speaker 1>so we get to go in there now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>teach them how to dig the latrines,</v>

1764
01:18:57.111 --> 01:18:59.510
<v Speaker 1>make sure it's way far enough away from</v>
<v Speaker 1>the water.</v>

1765
01:18:59.510 --> 01:19:00.740
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1766
01:19:00.890 --> 01:19:01.920
<v Speaker 1>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1767
01:19:02.270 --> 01:19:03.780
<v Speaker 1>outside of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's another issue too.</v>

1768
01:19:03.781 --> 01:19:06.200
<v Speaker 1>Erratic and can contaminate the water if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want.</v>

1769
01:19:06.230 --> 01:19:09.830
<v Speaker 1>If you have to keep um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is I think 30 meters away,</v>

1770
01:19:10.160 --> 01:19:13.160
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or more any latrines.</v>

1771
01:19:13.970 --> 01:19:15.830
<v Speaker 1>And then if it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1772
01:19:15.860 --> 01:19:19.550
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was that a dump?</v>

1773
01:19:19.551 --> 01:19:20.830
<v Speaker 1>The trash dump?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1774
01:19:20.870 --> 01:19:22.930
<v Speaker 1>it has to be 50 meters or more</v>
<v Speaker 1>batteries,</v>

1775
01:19:22.970 --> 01:19:24.970
<v Speaker 1>different stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

1776
01:19:25.100 --> 01:19:27.350
<v Speaker 1>and so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we make sure in this is what's not.</v>

1777
01:19:27.351 --> 01:19:29.310
<v Speaker 1>So uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1778
01:19:29.440 --> 01:19:33.350
<v Speaker 1>one of my last trips I went and we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>going through Uganda on the border of</v>

1779
01:19:33.351 --> 01:19:38.210
<v Speaker 1>Congo and there's these people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're so proud of their water well,</v>

1780
01:19:38.211 --> 01:19:41.060
<v Speaker 1>and I love that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then I feel like the people,</v>

1781
01:19:41.061 --> 01:19:42.490
<v Speaker 1>whoever did it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1782
01:19:43.660 --> 01:19:46.160
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cut them really short,</v>

1783
01:19:46.161 --> 01:19:48.470
<v Speaker 1>they're just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they shouldn't be drilling wells because</v>

1784
01:19:49.190 --> 01:19:53.510
<v Speaker 1>I went to the restroom and then also I</v>
<v Speaker 1>look out the window and I'm at a gas</v>

1785
01:19:53.511 --> 01:19:55.440
<v Speaker 1>station you got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a lot nicer than Congo.</v>

1786
01:19:55.670 --> 01:19:57.950
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's still terrible brutal</v>

1787
01:19:57.980 --> 01:20:00.830
<v Speaker 1>party parts of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just night and day difference.</v>

1788
01:20:01.420 --> 01:20:04.190
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and whenever I looked out and see</v>

1789
01:20:04.340 --> 01:20:06.410
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the 18 wheeler filling up,</v>

1790
01:20:06.411 --> 01:20:09.060
<v Speaker 1>here's someone else up in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in between that I'm,</v>

1791
01:20:09.150 --> 01:20:11.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm at the toilets at the other side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a trash dump.</v>

1792
01:20:12.120 --> 01:20:14.700
<v Speaker 1>There's 18 wheelers and trucks filling</v>
<v Speaker 1>up with fuel.</v>

1793
01:20:14.910 --> 01:20:18.180
<v Speaker 1>And right in the middle of the two fuel</v>
<v Speaker 1>pumps is a water.</v>

1794
01:20:18.181 --> 01:20:21.120
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they drilled it on the,</v>

1795
01:20:21.270 --> 01:20:26.270
<v Speaker 1>on the lot of the gas station with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>trash dump with a latrines and toilets.</v>

1796
01:20:26.700 --> 01:20:28.590
<v Speaker 1>And so it was completely contaminating</v>
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>

1797
01:20:28.800 --> 01:20:32.670
<v Speaker 1>The line was so long in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Ben was trying to tell him like,</v>

1798
01:20:32.671 --> 01:20:34.980
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just want to tell you because we love</v>

1799
01:20:34.981 --> 01:20:36.540
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That water is really not safe.</v>

1800
01:20:36.630 --> 01:20:37.770
<v Speaker 1>Same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Matt,</v>

1801
01:20:38.010 --> 01:20:40.340
<v Speaker 1>Matt kind of ingrained,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ingrained that into a store.</v>

1802
01:20:40.360 --> 01:20:41.570
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1803
01:20:42.300 --> 01:20:43.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to do it the right way.</v>

1804
01:20:43.980 --> 01:20:47.790
<v Speaker 1>And so ben was taught that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so these recent well that these guys had</v>

1805
01:20:47.791 --> 01:20:50.850
<v Speaker 1>put in and it was one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's a big line of people to try</v>

1806
01:20:50.851 --> 01:20:53.010
<v Speaker 1>to get to this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>telling you there was at least 20,</v>

1807
01:20:53.011 --> 01:20:54.620
<v Speaker 1>30 people in line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1808
01:20:54.990 --> 01:20:58.470
<v Speaker 1>and Ben was trying to tell them in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>most appropriate way possible.</v>

1809
01:20:58.471 --> 01:21:02.010
<v Speaker 1>They're like not crush the hopes and</v>
<v Speaker 1>dreams of the village there,</v>

1810
01:21:02.850 --> 01:21:04.050
<v Speaker 1>but you also want to know like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1811
01:21:04.051 --> 01:21:05.670
<v Speaker 1>this water can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it looks safe.</v>

1812
01:21:05.760 --> 01:21:07.720
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So uh,</v>

1813
01:21:07.860 --> 01:21:11.070
<v Speaker 1>so that's why we're testing our wells</v>
<v Speaker 1>and whatever happened in that,</v>

1814
01:21:11.180 --> 01:21:13.020
<v Speaker 1>which is you had to leave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1815
01:21:13.021 --> 01:21:17.010
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's a town we don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been in the town maybe twice,</v>

1816
01:21:17.430 --> 01:21:18.530
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1817
01:21:18.820 --> 01:21:20.850
<v Speaker 1>it was the first time that I saw last</v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

1818
01:21:21.480 --> 01:21:22.600
<v Speaker 1>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

1819
01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:23.340
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1820
01:21:23.340 --> 01:21:25.320
<v Speaker 1>but that's what's creating a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people don't know,</v>

1821
01:21:25.321 --> 01:21:27.890
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's no,</v>

1822
01:21:27.900 --> 01:21:28.470
<v Speaker 1>I know it is.</v>

1823
01:21:28.470 --> 01:21:32.610
<v Speaker 1>Half the hospital beds in the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>right now are because of dirty water or</v>

1824
01:21:32.611 --> 01:21:35.910
<v Speaker 1>water borne related diseases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>half,</v>

1825
01:21:35.911 --> 01:21:36.744
<v Speaker 1>half and half.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1826
01:21:38.280 --> 01:21:40.380
<v Speaker 1>So if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we were able to,</v>

1827
01:21:40.630 --> 01:21:42.810
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if as human beings,</v>

1828
01:21:42.840 --> 01:21:46.940
<v Speaker 1>if we could join forces unite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kinda like everyone did against a</v>

1829
01:21:47.010 --> 01:21:50.130
<v Speaker 1>bullet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we attack the problem head on and</v>

1830
01:21:50.160 --> 01:21:52.470
<v Speaker 1>just because we got it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't pretend to everybody else has</v>

1831
01:21:52.471 --> 01:21:55.290
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we could really in this thing,</v>

1832
01:21:55.320 --> 01:21:56.153
<v Speaker 1>we could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1833
01:21:56.850 --> 01:21:58.980
<v Speaker 1>we could fix it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the tools are there,</v>

1834
01:21:59.010 --> 01:22:01.140
<v Speaker 1>the water is there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's under her feet.</v>

1835
01:22:02.340 --> 01:22:04.020
<v Speaker 1>And here we wasted it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there we,</v>

1836
01:22:04.080 --> 01:22:04.710
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1837
01:22:04.710 --> 01:22:05.543
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't have it.</v>

1838
01:22:05.670 --> 01:22:08.070
<v Speaker 1>We don't hear about Ebola anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1839
01:22:08.071 --> 01:22:10.650
<v Speaker 1>it's over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like they moved on to Zika,</v>

1840
01:22:11.020 --> 01:22:11.920
<v Speaker 1>Zika,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Zika,</v>

1841
01:22:12.010 --> 01:22:14.420
<v Speaker 1>Zika.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are All the Olympians are going to get</v>

1842
01:22:14.421 --> 01:22:14.770
<v Speaker 1>it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1843
01:22:14.770 --> 01:22:17.430
<v Speaker 1>They're fucked all of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1844
01:22:17.431 --> 01:22:18.090
<v Speaker 1>this is crazy.</v>

1845
01:22:18.090 --> 01:22:19.350
<v Speaker 1>When I got back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were,</v>

1846
01:22:19.410 --> 01:22:24.270
<v Speaker 1>the CDC was testing me on two different</v>
<v Speaker 1>rounds of treatments trying to figure</v>

1847
01:22:24.271 --> 01:22:27.000
<v Speaker 1>out what.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So on that trip I told you going in,</v>

1848
01:22:27.001 --> 01:22:29.210
<v Speaker 1>I got malaria right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>malaria.</v>

1849
01:22:29.211 --> 01:22:32.580
<v Speaker 1>I keep me ask you this because you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>malaria can somehow get it from,</v>

1850
01:22:32.581 --> 01:22:36.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if a mosquito stings you while you have</v>

1851
01:22:36.901 --> 01:22:38.280
<v Speaker 1>malaria and instinct,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody else,</v>

1852
01:22:38.310 --> 01:22:40.470
<v Speaker 1>they can't get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1853
01:22:41.640 --> 01:22:45.150
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's what I never heard of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never thought of that one.</v>

1854
01:22:45.151 --> 01:22:47.460
<v Speaker 1>But remember that when people were</v>
<v Speaker 1>worried about that with HIV,</v>

1855
01:22:48.390 --> 01:22:49.950
<v Speaker 1>they're worried about mosquito</v>
<v Speaker 1>transmission.</v>

1856
01:22:49.951 --> 01:22:52.170
<v Speaker 1>That was like the big thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Keep away from gay people in the summer.</v>

1857
01:22:54.330 --> 01:22:54.800
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1858
01:22:54.800 --> 01:22:56.850
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had never thought of that.</v>

1859
01:22:56.851 --> 01:22:59.100
<v Speaker 1>But I know that don't shoot here on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>swamp.</v>

1860
01:23:01.080 --> 01:23:03.030
<v Speaker 1>I know that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1861
01:23:03.090 --> 01:23:05.000
<v Speaker 1>the doctors that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1862
01:23:05.090 --> 01:23:06.440
<v Speaker 1>they're always saying you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're fine.</v>

1863
01:23:06.500 --> 01:23:09.160
<v Speaker 1>I mean I can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can fight and everything else.</v>

1864
01:23:09.200 --> 01:23:10.300
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My blood.</v>

1865
01:23:10.301 --> 01:23:12.550
<v Speaker 1>And you have malaria and you could</v>
<v Speaker 1>fight.</v>

1866
01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:13.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I,</v>

1867
01:23:13.700 --> 01:23:15.460
<v Speaker 1>I literally don't because it's in my</v>
<v Speaker 1>liver.</v>

1868
01:23:15.490 --> 01:23:18.850
<v Speaker 1>I think you'd have to go into the liver</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless it was a current outbreak.</v>

1869
01:23:18.851 --> 01:23:20.610
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what about a liver kick?</v>

1870
01:23:20.970 --> 01:23:22.840
<v Speaker 1>Got Liver kicked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't,</v>

1871
01:23:22.841 --> 01:23:24.760
<v Speaker 1>don't let out the Bazooka,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just get.</v>

1872
01:23:26.020 --> 01:23:27.620
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1873
01:23:27.640 --> 01:23:28.750
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1874
01:23:29.200 --> 01:23:31.800
<v Speaker 1>it's been a lot of fun too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

1875
01:23:31.820 --> 01:23:36.620
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think what maybe kinda shifted was the</v>

1876
01:23:37.320 --> 01:23:38.710
<v Speaker 1>kinda grown up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1877
01:23:38.740 --> 01:23:41.350
<v Speaker 1>getting bullied.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're only looking at why am I getting</v>

1878
01:23:41.351 --> 01:23:43.990
<v Speaker 1>bullied and all this stuff's true and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>am not a good person.</v>

1879
01:23:44.530 --> 01:23:46.600
<v Speaker 1>And then nobody likes me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

1880
01:23:47.020 --> 01:23:51.130
<v Speaker 1>Then when I got 23 fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>still not really fulfilled.</v>

1881
01:23:51.131 --> 01:23:53.260
<v Speaker 1>I was living for more for myself there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

1882
01:23:53.261 --> 01:23:54.094
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

1883
01:23:54.280 --> 01:23:58.960
<v Speaker 1>What am I doing with my life?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now it's so cool because seeing that</v>

1884
01:23:58.961 --> 01:24:03.070
<v Speaker 1>and being able to tell you that last</v>
<v Speaker 1>time I was here 20 water wells or 25.</v>

1885
01:24:03.160 --> 01:24:06.760
<v Speaker 1>But regardless we've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've done 20 or 25 more.</v>

1886
01:24:07.240 --> 01:24:11.320
<v Speaker 1>And so that to me is a life that I get</v>
<v Speaker 1>to look at.</v>

1887
01:24:11.321 --> 01:24:14.110
<v Speaker 1>And if I were to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I were to die,</v>

1888
01:24:14.111 --> 01:24:18.130
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know without a shadow of a doubt that</v>

1889
01:24:18.131 --> 01:24:22.060
<v Speaker 1>my life meant something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I know that I would,</v>

1890
01:24:22.150 --> 01:24:25.470
<v Speaker 1>I never felt that before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>during the depression,</v>

1891
01:24:25.540 --> 01:24:29.590
<v Speaker 1>addiction and all that other stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But now I know that the life I live</v>

1892
01:24:29.591 --> 01:24:32.050
<v Speaker 1>hopefully will outlive my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1893
01:24:32.051 --> 01:24:35.440
<v Speaker 1>like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want this team to doing what they're</v>

1894
01:24:35.441 --> 01:24:37.720
<v Speaker 1>doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>climb higher than I can climb,</v>

1895
01:24:37.721 --> 01:24:38.440
<v Speaker 1>run farther than that.</v>

1896
01:24:38.440 --> 01:24:40.900
<v Speaker 1>I can run,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jump higher than I can jump,</v>

1897
01:24:40.901 --> 01:24:42.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I want my.</v>

1898
01:24:42.700 --> 01:24:43.720
<v Speaker 1>What's that saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want my,</v>

1899
01:24:43.721 --> 01:24:48.580
<v Speaker 1>a ceiling to be there for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want them to go farther than I can go</v>

1900
01:24:48.640 --> 01:24:53.440
<v Speaker 1>because then that means that I actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>made an impact that matters,</v>

1901
01:24:53.890 --> 01:24:56.080
<v Speaker 1>that matter to them enough that it</v>
<v Speaker 1>continued,</v>

1902
01:24:56.650 --> 01:25:01.650
<v Speaker 1>that it had a residual effect that just</v>
<v Speaker 1>kept kept on going and me,</v>

1903
01:25:01.720 --> 01:25:06.430
<v Speaker 1>and that's really shifted kind of kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of everything in my life.</v>

1904
01:25:06.431 --> 01:25:07.000
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1905
01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.040
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what life is about.</v>

1906
01:25:09.070 --> 01:25:13.240
<v Speaker 1>Like if I know I've been signing my book</v>
<v Speaker 1>recently or ever since it came out,</v>

1907
01:25:13.241 --> 01:25:18.130
<v Speaker 1>but I signed it live to love,</v>
<v Speaker 1>love to live and I know that can sound</v>

1908
01:25:18.131 --> 01:25:21.820
<v Speaker 1>cheesy or goofy or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's something that just really</v>

1909
01:25:21.821 --> 01:25:26.140
<v Speaker 1>helped me whenever I was sobering up was</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1910
01:25:26.170 --> 01:25:30.490
<v Speaker 1>if that's what I focus on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I can live my life to love,</v>

1911
01:25:30.910 --> 01:25:33.210
<v Speaker 1>love now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>love the live,</v>

1912
01:25:33.211 --> 01:25:36.760
<v Speaker 1>but everyone wants to love their own</v>
<v Speaker 1>life that they live and so they're just</v>

1913
01:25:36.761 --> 01:25:40.180
<v Speaker 1>focused on that and get this and get</v>
<v Speaker 1>this materialistic thing and get this</v>

1914
01:25:40.181 --> 01:25:41.950
<v Speaker 1>different chick because she didn't make</v>
<v Speaker 1>me happier.</v>

1915
01:25:42.250 --> 01:25:43.600
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this or that or whatever.</v>

1916
01:25:43.780 --> 01:25:44.830
<v Speaker 1>Whenever it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

1917
01:25:44.831 --> 01:25:45.664
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

1918
01:25:45.790 --> 01:25:47.800
<v Speaker 1>let's focus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's.</v>

1919
01:25:47.980 --> 01:25:51.490
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If that's a natural inclination to</v>

1920
01:25:51.670 --> 01:25:55.990
<v Speaker 1>gravitate towards unattainable things</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Ferrari's and mansions and you see</v>

1921
01:25:55.991 --> 01:25:58.470
<v Speaker 1>those things on tv and the movies and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just,</v>

1922
01:25:58.810 --> 01:26:03.040
<v Speaker 1>that shows you that you've made it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you don't have anything in,</v>

1923
01:26:03.280 --> 01:26:04.100
<v Speaker 1>you're wanting for</v>

1924
01:26:04.100 --> 01:26:07.370
<v Speaker 2>things and you don't have money and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're struggling,</v>

1925
01:26:07.700 --> 01:26:10.820
<v Speaker 2>you look at someone who's got all those</v>
<v Speaker 2>things and money and you think,</v>

1926
01:26:10.850 --> 01:26:13.760
<v Speaker 2>if I only had that all my worries would</v>
<v Speaker 2>be gone,</v>

1927
01:26:13.980 --> 01:26:17.720
<v Speaker 2>then I would be happy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you have that and nobody likes</v>

1928
01:26:17.721 --> 01:26:19.430
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you life is shit.</v>

1929

1930
01:26:20.380 --> 01:26:21.890
<v Speaker 2>it's still shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you are in a hut in the middle of</v>
<v Speaker 2>nowhere with,</v>

1932
01:26:26.030 --> 01:26:29.870
<v Speaker 2>well the middle of the Congo with all</v>
<v Speaker 2>these people and you're having a great</v>

1933
01:26:29.871 --> 01:26:34.490
<v Speaker 2>time and you're making wells and you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>loving life that,</v>

1934
01:26:34.510 --> 01:26:35.480
<v Speaker 2>that picture that</v>

1935
01:26:36.430 --> 01:26:37.450
<v Speaker 1>came up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think why?</v>

1936
01:26:37.540 --> 01:26:41.560
<v Speaker 1>Why I got so excited was um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that night in that village,</v>

1937
01:26:43.180 --> 01:26:45.310
<v Speaker 1>I mean we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not kidding.</v>

1938
01:26:45.760 --> 01:26:49.930
<v Speaker 1>Danced and danced and danced and in and</v>
<v Speaker 1>in feast it.</v>

1939
01:26:49.931 --> 01:26:53.200
<v Speaker 1>I mean we just all came together just to</v>
<v Speaker 1>celebrate,</v>

1940
01:26:53.530 --> 01:26:55.510
<v Speaker 1>celebrate life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>celebrate each other,</v>

1941
01:26:55.660 --> 01:26:56.381
<v Speaker 1>celebrate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Guess what?</v>

1942
01:26:56.381 --> 01:26:58.780
<v Speaker 1>Our kids are going to be sick anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Different stuff like that too,</v>

1943
01:26:58.790 --> 01:27:03.790
<v Speaker 1>where it's just a life where like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what you were just saying,</v>

1944
01:27:04.360 --> 01:27:06.010
<v Speaker 1>you're always comparing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>comparing,</v>

1945
01:27:06.011 --> 01:27:07.900
<v Speaker 1>comparing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For me,</v>

1946
01:27:07.910 --> 01:27:09.220
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Comparison.</v>

1947
01:27:09.550 --> 01:27:11.860
<v Speaker 1>I think for most people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1948
01:27:12.130 --> 01:27:16.030
<v Speaker 1>comparison is probably the number one</v>
<v Speaker 1>fif what robs us of joy,</v>

1949
01:27:16.230 --> 01:27:19.180
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of being able to be at peace is we're</v>

1950
01:27:19.181 --> 01:27:21.310
<v Speaker 1>always comparing ourselves and we always</v>
<v Speaker 1>compare up.</v>

1951
01:27:21.340 --> 01:27:23.440
<v Speaker 1>We never compared down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1952
01:27:23.800 --> 01:27:26.290
<v Speaker 1>or just compare ourselves to people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are just like us.</v>

1953
01:27:26.320 --> 01:27:29.890
<v Speaker 1>We always look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you're saying is unattainable and</v>

1954
01:27:29.891 --> 01:27:31.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm always pursuing that.</v>

1955
01:27:31.270 --> 01:27:34.190
<v Speaker 1>And my whole thing has been like</v>
<v Speaker 1>recently just man,</v>

1956
01:27:34.240 --> 01:27:35.980
<v Speaker 1>I just want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think our,</v>

1957
01:27:36.160 --> 01:27:40.960
<v Speaker 1>I've learned it from our team in Congo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's been the greatest gift.</v>

1958
01:27:40.961 --> 01:27:42.970
<v Speaker 1>Like you were saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1959
01:27:43.120 --> 01:27:46.690
<v Speaker 1>there's been a lot of great stuff that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>been happening and that's true.</v>

1960
01:27:46.720 --> 01:27:50.770
<v Speaker 1>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and started thinking now I think it</v>

1961
01:27:50.771 --> 01:27:52.200
<v Speaker 1>sounds Cliche,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'll say it anyways,</v>

1962
01:27:52.220 --> 01:27:57.220
<v Speaker 1>where men like</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've given me more of a gift than I</v>

1963
01:27:57.341 --> 01:27:58.780
<v Speaker 1>can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can give them.</v>

1964
01:27:58.960 --> 01:27:59.361
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1965
01:27:59.361 --> 01:28:01.210
<v Speaker 1>you see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I told you that the grown up and</v>

1966
01:28:01.211 --> 01:28:02.044
<v Speaker 1>everything else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to,</v>

1967
01:28:02.200 --> 01:28:04.480
<v Speaker 1>to find a life of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of purpose,</v>

1968
01:28:04.510 --> 01:28:08.830
<v Speaker 1>have passion of helping one another of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

1969
01:28:08.860 --> 01:28:11.440
<v Speaker 1>our mission statement is defend the weak</v>
<v Speaker 1>love,</v>

1970
01:28:11.441 --> 01:28:14.650
<v Speaker 1>the unloved and power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the voiceless than the vision statement</v>

1971
01:28:14.651 --> 01:28:17.860
<v Speaker 1>is overcoming oppression with</v>
<v Speaker 1>overwhelming opportunity.</v>

1972
01:28:18.410 --> 01:28:21.010
<v Speaker 1>And so if we can go into these</v>
<v Speaker 1>communities and we've seen incredible</v>

1973
01:28:21.011 --> 01:28:21.980
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what's gonna be in the Doc.</v>

1974
01:28:21.990 --> 01:28:24.220
<v Speaker 1>This last trip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>

1975
01:28:24.280 --> 01:28:25.690
<v Speaker 1>Ben,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Matt and Derek,</v>

1976
01:28:25.691 --> 01:28:27.760
<v Speaker 1>the filmmaker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we would not be,</v>

1977
01:28:28.270 --> 01:28:30.610
<v Speaker 1>they wouldn't be ashamed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Me saying this,</v>

1978
01:28:30.670 --> 01:28:33.550
<v Speaker 1>we were in tears after an interview</v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

1979
01:28:33.551 --> 01:28:37.090
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the former slave masters that ran</v>

1980
01:28:37.091 --> 01:28:38.620
<v Speaker 1>a hospital,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1981
01:28:39.460 --> 01:28:40.900
<v Speaker 1>in actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you could pull up a picture,</v>

1982
01:28:40.901 --> 01:28:43.120
<v Speaker 1>it's called Cap Toula.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1983
01:28:44.050 --> 01:28:46.600
<v Speaker 1>and we were at this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this hospital.</v>

1984
01:28:47.380 --> 01:28:51.200
<v Speaker 1>And it's tough because we were trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get treatment for Cap Tuliza.</v>

1985
01:28:51.260 --> 01:28:53.670
<v Speaker 1>He's a buddy of mine that passed away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1986
01:28:53.710 --> 01:28:56.050
<v Speaker 1>and we spent seven months taking the</v>
<v Speaker 1>hospital to the hospital,</v>

1987
01:28:56.100 --> 01:28:58.370
<v Speaker 1>the hospital,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're just send them away because</v>

1988
01:28:58.371 --> 01:29:00.680
<v Speaker 1>it was the pygmy in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>

1989
01:29:00.810 --> 01:29:02.070
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my</v>

1990
01:29:02.100 --> 01:29:05.710
<v Speaker 2>first song actually if you bring up the</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe the first cap,</v>

1991
01:29:06.030 --> 01:29:09.870
<v Speaker 2>that's when I saw them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's when I saw him for the very first</v>

1992
01:29:09.871 --> 01:29:13.000
<v Speaker 2>time or looking at a guidance is</v>
<v Speaker 2>extremely amazing.</v>

1993
01:29:14.600 --> 01:29:16.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so for me,</v>

1994
01:29:16.660 --> 01:29:18.540
<v Speaker 2>so what is going on with his health</v>
<v Speaker 2>right here,</v>

1995
01:29:18.570 --> 01:29:19.950
<v Speaker 2>right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We didn't know.</v>

1996
01:29:20.160 --> 01:29:21.690
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had,</v>

1997
01:29:21.710 --> 01:29:24.210
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean a gut feeling that it could have</v>

1998
01:29:24.211 --> 01:29:27.720
<v Speaker 2>been tuberculosis because we've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've helped several of the pygmies have</v>

1999
01:29:27.721 --> 01:29:30.540
<v Speaker 2>tuberculosis and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>little grilling Faena and some others.</v>

2000
01:29:31.060 --> 01:29:31.740
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fema,</v>

2001
01:29:31.740 --> 01:29:34.760
<v Speaker 2>nettle root cause of tuberculosis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was some sort of a study on that.</v>

2002
01:29:34.770 --> 01:29:36.900
<v Speaker 2>Reasons that you have a low immune</v>
<v Speaker 2>system.</v>

2003
01:29:36.901 --> 01:29:39.090
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was something that just came out</v>

2004
01:29:39.091 --> 01:29:41.760
<v Speaker 2>like really recently about tuberculosis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Were there.</v>

2005
01:29:43.630 --> 01:29:44.940
<v Speaker 2>I had something to do with fire.</v>

2006
01:29:46.930 --> 01:29:47.763
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>

2007
01:29:48.180 --> 01:29:48.460
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

2008
01:29:48.460 --> 01:29:52.630
<v Speaker 2>if it's something to do with smoke,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe that because the bacteria from</v>

2009
01:29:52.631 --> 01:29:56.800
<v Speaker 2>person to person through microscopic</v>
<v Speaker 2>droplets releasing the air can happen</v>

2010
01:29:56.801 --> 01:30:00.880
<v Speaker 2>when someone in the untreated active</v>
<v Speaker 2>form of tuberculosis cough speaks,</v>

2011
01:30:01.060 --> 01:30:02.410
<v Speaker 2>sneezes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Spitz,</v>

2012
01:30:02.440 --> 01:30:05.230
<v Speaker 2>laughs or sayings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ.</v>

2013
01:30:05.231 --> 01:30:07.510
<v Speaker 2>Mind you get tuberculosis from a shitty</v>
<v Speaker 2>song.</v>

2014
01:30:08.470 --> 01:30:12.850
<v Speaker 2>Like some dude breaks out the Banjo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that scene in animal house breaks</v>

2015
01:30:12.851 --> 01:30:16.030
<v Speaker 2>out a guitar and started saying it and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it gives you tuberculosis as well as an</v>

2016
01:30:16.031 --> 01:30:21.031
<v Speaker 2>ir beating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's see if this.</v>

2017
01:30:21.520 --> 01:30:23.170
<v Speaker 2>Was there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some connection with fire.</v>

2018
01:30:23.171 --> 01:30:25.990
<v Speaker 2>I swear I read something really recently</v>
<v Speaker 2>about that.</v>

2019
01:30:26.620 --> 01:30:29.590
<v Speaker 2>Some connection between tuberculosis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that it?</v>

2020
01:30:30.010 --> 01:30:33.910
<v Speaker 2>Here it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was tuberculosis born of fire by</v>

2021
01:30:33.911 --> 01:30:37.180
<v Speaker 2>damaging lungs and bringing people</v>
<v Speaker 2>together?</v>

2022
01:30:37.720 --> 01:30:42.720
<v Speaker 2>Fire may have turned a soil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Microbes into global pathogen.</v>

2023
01:30:44.560 --> 01:30:46.960
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Many thousands of years ago.</v>

2024
01:30:46.980 --> 01:30:47.813
<v Speaker 2>Chile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>African night.</v>

2025
01:30:47.890 --> 01:30:50.860
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they think that might have started it</v>

2026
01:30:50.870 --> 01:30:54.490
<v Speaker 2>all around a fire in a cave and that</v>
<v Speaker 2>were always in the fire.</v>

2027
01:30:54.490 --> 01:30:55.780
<v Speaker 2>I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't sleep with.</v>

2028
01:30:55.930 --> 01:30:58.750
<v Speaker 2>That's why the bugs are even worse on me</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I.</v>

2029
01:30:58.750 --> 01:31:02.980
<v Speaker 2>I have many times slept in the huts</v>
<v Speaker 2>whenever the fires go in,</v>

2030
01:31:03.370 --> 01:31:05.380
<v Speaker 2>but it just fills up with smoke toward</v>
<v Speaker 2>my eyes.</v>

2031
01:31:05.381 --> 01:31:07.900
<v Speaker 2>Just tears are coming down with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>light.</v>

2032
01:31:07.901 --> 01:31:09.310
<v Speaker 2>A fire in their hut.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2033
01:31:09.311 --> 01:31:11.920
<v Speaker 2>that's their.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how they keep the bugs out.</v>

2034
01:31:12.370 --> 01:31:13.510
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well it's one of the ways,</v>

2035
01:31:13.511 --> 01:31:17.790
<v Speaker 2>but it's mainly for warmth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a benefit is there's less bugs and</v>

2036
01:31:17.830 --> 01:31:18.730
<v Speaker 2>then uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

2037
01:31:18.731 --> 01:31:22.030
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it can help waterproof.</v>

2038
01:31:22.100 --> 01:31:26.880
<v Speaker 2>They're tweaking leaf huts were enough</v>
<v Speaker 2>smoke and everything had kinda like a</v>

2039
01:31:26.970 --> 01:31:28.000
<v Speaker 2>tar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah.</v>

2040
01:31:28.690 --> 01:31:30.400
<v Speaker 2>Your lungs too though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2041
01:31:30.401 --> 01:31:31.061
<v Speaker 2>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2042
01:31:31.061 --> 01:31:34.530
<v Speaker 2>And there's so many kids that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting in at this sustainable solutions</v>

2043
01:31:34.531 --> 01:31:36.090
<v Speaker 2>center that we're hoping to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2044
01:31:36.430 --> 01:31:38.590
<v Speaker 2>get up and running.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're wanting one for cooking where they</v>

2045
01:31:38.591 --> 01:31:43.591
<v Speaker 2>can use either corn cobs or a or corn</v>
<v Speaker 2>husk or peanut shells or different</v>

2046
01:31:44.201 --> 01:31:48.280
<v Speaker 2>things where they can put those into</v>
<v Speaker 2>little briquettes and then they can use</v>

2047
01:31:48.281 --> 01:31:50.270
<v Speaker 2>that and recycle it and everything else</v>
<v Speaker 2>in it,</v>

2048
01:31:50.400 --> 01:31:52.450
<v Speaker 2>it burns longer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2049
01:31:52.540 --> 01:31:54.190
<v Speaker 2>at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the same temperature.</v>

2050
01:31:54.580 --> 01:31:55.810
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2051
01:31:55.811 --> 01:31:58.570
<v Speaker 2>And you don't have to force anything and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not breathing in that terrible</v>

2052
01:31:58.571 --> 01:32:00.310
<v Speaker 2>smoke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Coconut charcoal</v>

2053
01:32:00.310 --> 01:32:02.350
<v Speaker 1>is a really fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2054
01:32:02.530 --> 01:32:03.970
<v Speaker 1>there's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some company,</v>

2055
01:32:03.971 --> 01:32:07.120
<v Speaker 1>a grilled tomato company.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what a tomato is one of those</v>

2056
01:32:07.121 --> 01:32:08.760
<v Speaker 1>Japanese grills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

2057
01:32:08.770 --> 01:32:10.300
<v Speaker 1>like a green egg,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that kind of thing.</v>

2058
01:32:10.600 --> 01:32:14.800
<v Speaker 1>And they sell a charcoal made out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>coconut and apparently it's one of the</v>

2059
01:32:14.840 --> 01:32:18.040
<v Speaker 1>best charcoals because it's really</v>
<v Speaker 1>sustainable,</v>

2060
01:32:18.041 --> 01:32:23.041
<v Speaker 1>it's really easy to grow and it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's much wages throw it away.</v>

2061
01:32:24.840 --> 01:32:26.950
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

2062
01:32:27.520 --> 01:32:29.680
<v Speaker 1>People throw the outside of the cook</v>
<v Speaker 1>another way,</v>

<v Speaker 1>That was the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love it dude.</v>

2076
01:33:04.290 --> 01:33:06.190
<v Speaker 1>I love the UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I was 13 years old.</v>

2077
01:33:06.191 --> 01:33:09.820
<v Speaker 1>Found the stapes and I'm just on that</v>
<v Speaker 1>real quick,</v>

2078
01:33:10.130 --> 01:33:13.180
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why bottle those tapes put 'em under my</v>

2079
01:33:13.181 --> 01:33:17.770
<v Speaker 1>bed and I would wait for my parents to</v>
<v Speaker 1>go to work or to go to sleep and I'd be</v>

2080
01:33:17.771 --> 01:33:19.110
<v Speaker 1>popping them in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2081
01:33:19.210 --> 01:33:20.070
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2082
01:33:20.071 --> 01:33:23.800
<v Speaker 1>the vhs and my dad comes in and I turn</v>
<v Speaker 1>it off real quick,</v>

2083
01:33:23.801 --> 01:33:25.890
<v Speaker 1>lay down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>act like I'm asleep and it's,</v>

2084
01:33:25.900 --> 01:33:26.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the vcrs,</v>

2085
01:33:27.130 --> 01:33:29.490
<v Speaker 1>vhs is still moving in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2086
01:33:29.670 --> 01:33:31.540
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the screen still lit up and everything,</v>

2087
01:33:32.240 --> 01:33:35.530
<v Speaker 1>but he had confiscated that tape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then when he found the rest he thought</v>

2088
01:33:35.531 --> 01:33:36.550
<v Speaker 1>it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all porn,</v>

2089
01:33:36.790 --> 01:33:41.790
<v Speaker 1>but it was a binding confiscated a lot.</v>

2090
01:33:41.860 --> 01:33:45.640
<v Speaker 1>I think me being 13 being picked on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't want me to start fighting</v>

2091
01:33:45.641 --> 01:33:48.850
<v Speaker 1>people at school and different stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so just a,</v>

2092
01:33:49.360 --> 01:33:50.470
<v Speaker 1>just a precaution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he always,</v>

2093
01:33:50.550 --> 01:33:53.980
<v Speaker 1>he told my mom he's going to do that one</v>
<v Speaker 1>day if we let him keep that stuff.</v>

2094
01:33:54.970 --> 01:33:55.701
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2095
01:33:55.701 --> 01:33:56.640
<v Speaker 1>it won't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in my head I'm like,</v>

2096
01:33:56.641 --> 01:33:57.310
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will.</v>

2097
01:33:57.310 --> 01:34:02.310
<v Speaker 1>I remember looking at the vhs tape and</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I turned it over and saw the</v>

2098
01:34:03.880 --> 01:34:07.120
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu and sumo and boxing and</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrestling and all these different</v>

2099
01:34:07.121 --> 01:34:09.820
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it came alive to me and it's like,</v>

2100
01:34:09.821 --> 01:34:11.440
<v Speaker 1>oh my goodness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these guys.</v>

2101
01:34:12.070 --> 01:34:14.230
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I originally connected with it</v>

2102
01:34:14.240 --> 01:34:16.030
<v Speaker 1>because because I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2103
01:34:16.150 --> 01:34:19.600
<v Speaker 1>well these guys are anything like me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they could stick up for themselves.</v>

2104
01:34:19.601 --> 01:34:21.070
<v Speaker 1>They can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're an athlete,</v>

2105
01:34:21.071 --> 01:34:23.290
<v Speaker 1>they're popular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably said being the laughingstock at</v>

2106
01:34:23.291 --> 01:34:26.170
<v Speaker 1>the party.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might be invited to the party or it</v>

2107
01:34:26.171 --> 01:34:27.004
<v Speaker 1>might be their party.</v>

2108
01:34:27.850 --> 01:34:29.740
<v Speaker 1>And so I mean I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I liked that aspect,</v>

2109
01:34:29.741 --> 01:34:33.670
<v Speaker 1>but then I just fell in love with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>sport of it and you're watching it and</v>

2110
01:34:33.671 --> 01:34:37.630
<v Speaker 1>seeing how everything and now being a</v>
<v Speaker 1>fan and watch now it's evolved and</v>

2111
01:34:37.631 --> 01:34:38.500
<v Speaker 1>everything else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

2112
01:34:39.120 --> 01:34:41.560
<v Speaker 1>it's not seeing the guy like Dan</v>
<v Speaker 1>Henderson that's been fighting,</v>

2113
01:34:41.561 --> 01:34:43.210
<v Speaker 1>I think isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Twenty years straight.</v>

2114
01:34:43.250 --> 01:34:44.150
<v Speaker 1>20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20,</v>

2115
01:34:44.350 --> 01:34:47.140
<v Speaker 1>straight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I was there when he was fighting in</v>

2116
01:34:47.150 --> 01:34:49.870
<v Speaker 1>97 and I wasn't there for his first</v>
<v Speaker 1>fight.</v>

2117
01:34:50.140 --> 01:34:52.510
<v Speaker 1>He fought in [inaudible] 96 I think in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brazil.</v>

2118
01:34:52.600 --> 01:34:54.240
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that was his first.</v>

2119
01:34:54.370 --> 01:34:56.830
<v Speaker 1>I actually watched that first fight in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the last couple of weeks.</v>

2120
01:34:56.870 --> 01:34:57.680
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2121
01:34:57.680 --> 01:34:58.110
<v Speaker 1>because</v>

2122
01:34:58.110 --> 01:34:59.380
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I loved him.</v>

2123
01:35:00.040 --> 01:35:00.873
<v Speaker 2>Awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2124
01:35:01.210 --> 01:35:04.460
<v Speaker 2>And see him even I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>because whenever he stepped in,</v>

2125
01:35:04.640 --> 01:35:06.440
<v Speaker 2>he was just a wrestler that had heavy</v>
<v Speaker 2>hands,</v>

2126
01:35:06.620 --> 01:35:08.220
<v Speaker 2>but then he just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he didn't even have to be.</v>

2127
01:35:08.810 --> 01:35:09.643
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're right.</v>

2128
01:35:09.740 --> 01:35:11.950
<v Speaker 2>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Getting it was just a down and I'm</v>

2129
01:35:12.140 --> 01:35:17.140
<v Speaker 2>taking them down and pound on them and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he figured out over time how to utilize</v>

2130
01:35:17.751 --> 01:35:19.130
<v Speaker 2>his power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I want to get.</v>

2131
01:35:19.131 --> 01:35:24.110
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I could bribe a den or big country</v>
<v Speaker 2>or someone to teach me that big right</v>

2132
01:35:24.111 --> 01:35:28.610
<v Speaker 2>hand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think someone that I don't mean</v>

2133
01:35:28.611 --> 01:35:33.190
<v Speaker 2>Dan's one of the guys that have come on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but big country always has power.</v>

2134
01:35:33.710 --> 01:35:37.190
<v Speaker 2>Big country was known way back in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>day as being a Jujitsu guy.</v>

2135
01:35:37.220 --> 01:35:40.230
<v Speaker 2>He was one of Mark Landmines guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he was a,</v>

2136
01:35:40.340 --> 01:35:42.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like really respected as a grappler</v>

2137
01:35:43.150 --> 01:35:47.060
<v Speaker 2>black belt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But to go from that to being this crazy</v>

2138
01:35:47.061 --> 01:35:50.990
<v Speaker 2>knockout brawler,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like people rarely see big country.</v>

2139
01:35:51.080 --> 01:35:53.450
<v Speaker 2>He'd never seen submitted anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2140
01:35:53.480 --> 01:35:56.340
<v Speaker 2>the closest thing was when he took Kimbo</v>
<v Speaker 2>down and got him into the mounted</v>

2141
01:35:56.350 --> 01:35:58.970
<v Speaker 2>crucifix and just elbowed them until the</v>
<v Speaker 2>referee stopped the fight.</v>

2142
01:35:59.650 --> 01:36:01.650
<v Speaker 2>But then the whole season,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2143
01:36:02.030 --> 01:36:03.410
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there were a couple elbows,</v>

2144
01:36:03.411 --> 01:36:07.490
<v Speaker 2>but when they finally stopped it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were all counting every single punch</v>

2145
01:36:07.730 --> 01:36:08.450
<v Speaker 2>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2146
01:36:08.450 --> 01:36:11.670
<v Speaker 2>but he was just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just tapping his forehead like this one</v>

2147
01:36:11.750 --> 01:36:14.270
<v Speaker 2>because it wasn't intelligently</v>
<v Speaker 2>defending himself,</v>

2148
01:36:14.271 --> 01:36:16.530
<v Speaker 2>but he didn't even have to hurt them to</v>
<v Speaker 2>stop the fight.</v>

2149
01:36:16.540 --> 01:36:18.170
<v Speaker 2>I just tapping his forehead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2150
01:36:18.171 --> 01:36:20.300
<v Speaker 2>he was almost like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2151
01:36:20.301 --> 01:36:23.150
<v Speaker 2>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what does that called in wrestling when</v>

2152
01:36:23.151 --> 01:36:25.790
<v Speaker 2>you have so many points?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a technical.</v>

2153
01:36:26.070 --> 01:36:26.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That fall,</v>

2154
01:36:27.240 --> 01:36:29.760
<v Speaker 2>fall almost like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you're never coming back to</v>

2155
01:36:29.761 --> 01:36:32.660
<v Speaker 2>this 10,</v>
<v Speaker 2>10 run rule and little league baseball.</v>

2156
01:36:32.770 --> 01:36:34.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>10 points up.</v>

2157
01:36:34.041 --> 01:36:34.750
<v Speaker 2>You just call it.</v>

2158
01:36:34.750 --> 01:36:37.490
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the big countries got very good</v>

2159
01:36:37.530 --> 01:36:40.250
<v Speaker 2>submissions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But everybody expected that from him</v>

2160
01:36:40.251 --> 01:36:42.530
<v Speaker 2>when he started fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you remember back when he was</v>

2161
01:36:42.531 --> 01:36:45.200
<v Speaker 2>fighting for a lead ECC,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was like the most corrupt</v>

2162
01:36:45.201 --> 01:36:50.201
<v Speaker 2>organization in the early days of MMA.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had Andre Arlovski down control up</v>

2163
01:36:50.480 --> 01:36:54.290
<v Speaker 2>working for Komora,</v>
<v Speaker 2>had that control and had that double</v>

2164
01:36:54.291 --> 01:36:56.990
<v Speaker 2>wrist lock position and it was working</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the Camorra and they stood them</v>

2165
01:36:56.991 --> 01:36:59.300
<v Speaker 2>right up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I remember watching TV going,</v>

2166
01:37:00.250 --> 01:37:03.060
<v Speaker 2>it's cool screaming at the TV,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's Co rob,</v>

2167
01:37:04.050 --> 01:37:06.590
<v Speaker 2>they had a 15 second rule,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if you went,</v>

2168
01:37:06.591 --> 01:37:09.110
<v Speaker 2>if you went to the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if nothing happened in 15 seconds,</v>

2169
01:37:09.500 --> 01:37:11.780
<v Speaker 2>I think jake shields submitted Paul</v>
<v Speaker 2>Daley.</v>

2170
01:37:11.781 --> 01:37:14.270
<v Speaker 2>It was one of the few submissions and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that lead to ECC,</v>

2171
01:37:14.600 --> 01:37:16.280
<v Speaker 2>but it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he just mounted them and just</v>

2172
01:37:16.370 --> 01:37:18.230
<v Speaker 2>immediately went to an arm bar and</v>
<v Speaker 2>locked it in.</v>

2173
01:37:19.250 --> 01:37:20.280
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2174
01:37:20.570 --> 01:37:22.820
<v Speaker 2>I think it's Paul Daley.</v>

2175
01:37:23.380 --> 01:37:25.700
<v Speaker 2>I might be wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was actually,</v>

2176
01:37:25.730 --> 01:37:27.420
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2177
01:37:27.940 --> 01:37:29.600
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with kimball stuff happening.</v>

2178
01:37:29.601 --> 01:37:31.160
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty roomy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's sad.</v>

2179
01:37:31.220 --> 01:37:34.850
<v Speaker 2>Very sad that man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean apparently he had a doctor</v>

2180
01:37:34.851 --> 01:37:35.684
<v Speaker 2>telling them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2181
01:37:35.690 --> 01:37:36.920
<v Speaker 2>for people don't know what we're talking</v>
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>

2182
01:37:36.921 --> 01:37:40.490
<v Speaker 2>Kimbo died really recently of a heart</v>
<v Speaker 2>disease and he had a doctor telling them</v>

2183
01:37:40.491 --> 01:37:43.250
<v Speaker 2>recently that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he needed a heart transplant.</v>

2184
01:37:43.730 --> 01:37:47.740
<v Speaker 2>I guess he had some sort of congenital</v>
<v Speaker 2>heart disease that um,</v>

2185
01:37:48.300 --> 01:37:49.700
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how could that be,</v>

2186
01:37:49.780 --> 01:37:50.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you look at them,</v>

2187
01:37:50.630 --> 01:37:52.820
<v Speaker 2>you guys a studies in great shape.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2188
01:37:53.030 --> 01:37:56.340
<v Speaker 2>how could you imagine that he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his heart was so bad</v>

2189
01:37:56.340 --> 01:37:58.230
<v Speaker 1>that they were telling me you needed a</v>
<v Speaker 1>heart transplant</v>

2190
01:38:00.160 --> 01:38:01.600
<v Speaker 1>and this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2191
01:38:01.740 --> 01:38:05.070
<v Speaker 1>this could probably sounds cliche again</v>
<v Speaker 1>too,</v>

2192
01:38:05.400 --> 01:38:09.330
<v Speaker 1>because knowing him being on ultimate</v>
<v Speaker 1>fighter and a and him cooking the best</v>

2193
01:38:09.331 --> 01:38:10.740
<v Speaker 1>steak I've ever had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry,</v>

2194
01:38:10.741 --> 01:38:11.730
<v Speaker 1>big Josh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2195
01:38:11.910 --> 01:38:13.680
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he,</v>

2196
01:38:13.681 --> 01:38:14.840
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know yet,</v>

2197
01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:18.870
<v Speaker 1>even though we had a bad heart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think emotionally I had a good heart</v>

2198
01:38:18.930 --> 01:38:20.590
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was always a good guy.</v>

2199
01:38:20.680 --> 01:38:22.290
<v Speaker 1>He's a very friendly guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2200
01:38:22.320 --> 01:38:24.390
<v Speaker 1>Even even with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2201
01:38:25.370 --> 01:38:29.850
<v Speaker 1>I mean technically we were supposed to</v>
<v Speaker 1>fight I think three times before or two</v>

2202
01:38:29.851 --> 01:38:32.730
<v Speaker 1>times elite ECC.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wish my name was in the hat for that.</v>

2203
01:38:33.010 --> 01:38:36.120
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then because I was like in 19 or 20</v>

2204
01:38:36.121 --> 01:38:39.360
<v Speaker 1>year old kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a decent record and then,</v>

2205
01:38:39.361 --> 01:38:42.330
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was bad matchup so they scrapped</v>

2206
01:38:42.331 --> 01:38:43.910
<v Speaker 1>it a get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't smart then,</v>

2207
01:38:43.920 --> 01:38:45.870
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then on the ultimate fighter I was</v>

2208
01:38:45.871 --> 01:38:48.450
<v Speaker 1>actually matched up with them and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then Roy got it.</v>

2209
01:38:48.940 --> 01:38:51.660
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then we were talking about it and</v>

2210
01:38:51.661 --> 01:38:53.970
<v Speaker 1>Bella tour were at our last fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2211
01:38:54.090 --> 01:38:56.880
<v Speaker 1>February 19th I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Houston Toyota Center.</v>

2212
01:38:57.090 --> 01:39:00.000
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and backstage,</v>

2213
01:39:00.390 --> 01:39:03.010
<v Speaker 1>uh Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually that was this,</v>

2214
01:39:03.070 --> 01:39:06.840

<v Speaker 1>my second fight.</v>

2218
01:39:15.330 --> 01:39:18.060
<v Speaker 1>And so the first fight actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you can pull up that video,</v>

2219

2245
01:40:33.281 --> 01:40:34.620
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean Josh was filming because he</v>

2246
01:40:34.621 --> 01:40:36.180
<v Speaker 1>didn't want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess it was a surprise they were</v>

2247
01:40:36.181 --> 01:40:39.120
<v Speaker 1>going to call me and everything else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they were in Uganda getting more</v>

2248
01:40:39.150 --> 01:40:41.160
<v Speaker 1>well drilling supplies and because you</v>

2249
01:40:41.280 --> 01:40:42.900
<v Speaker 1>you can't skype from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from Congo.</v>

2250
01:40:43.440 --> 01:40:48.240
<v Speaker 1>So they were at a decent enough hotel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had wifi and they were able to skype</v>

2251
01:40:48.241 --> 01:40:51.610
<v Speaker 1>with me the day of my first fight back</v>

01:40:52.040 --> 01:40:54.280
<v Speaker 1>me and it was awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was so much motivation.</v>

2253
01:40:54.281 --> 01:40:58.780
<v Speaker 1>Seeing them here in them and then having</v>
<v Speaker 1>them come for the second fight was just</v>

2254
01:40:58.781 --> 01:41:01.140
<v Speaker 1>a and b.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There he was actually,</v>

2255
01:41:01.150 --> 01:41:05.140
<v Speaker 1>he was actually in my corner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you're doing is helping them by</v>

2256
01:41:05.141 --> 01:41:08.500
<v Speaker 1>building wells is there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once you do that,</v>

2257
01:41:08.501 --> 01:41:12.550
<v Speaker 1>like say if you establish a series of</v>
<v Speaker 1>wells and well building and everybody</v>

2258
01:41:12.551 --> 01:41:15.040
<v Speaker 1>has fresh water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you want to take it?</v>

2259
01:41:15.040 --> 01:41:16.030
<v Speaker 1>Another step?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you,</v>

2260
01:41:16.060 --> 01:41:21.060
<v Speaker 1>did you want to try to give them safer</v>
<v Speaker 1>housing or cleaner housing?</v>

2261
01:41:21.191 --> 01:41:23.980
<v Speaker 1>Do you want to try to teach them how to</v>
<v Speaker 1>build houses or are you,</v>

2262
01:41:24.340 --> 01:41:27.430
<v Speaker 1>are you planning on an escalating it</v>
<v Speaker 1>from where you're at right now?</v>

2263
01:41:27.570 --> 01:41:28.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>

2264
01:41:28.670 --> 01:41:31.360
<v Speaker 1>I went about it and it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a learning lesson.</v>

2265
01:41:31.690 --> 01:41:34.420
<v Speaker 1>I don't regret it because I've got some</v>
<v Speaker 1>great training here in California as a,</v>

2266
01:41:34.630 --> 01:41:36.100
<v Speaker 1>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it called Hisperia?</v>

2267
01:41:36.400 --> 01:41:37.360
<v Speaker 1>California?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

2268
01:41:37.361 --> 01:41:41.290
<v Speaker 1>there's something called cal earth and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they built eco domes are earth bag homes</v>

2269
01:41:41.380 --> 01:41:42.940
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they call them,</v>

2270
01:41:42.941 --> 01:41:44.650
<v Speaker 1>super adobe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the technical term,</v>

2271
01:41:45.190 --> 01:41:48.770
<v Speaker 1>but they make,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it looks like pygmy huts out of sandbags</v>

2272
01:41:48.850 --> 01:41:52.070
<v Speaker 1>that they fill up with sand doing a</v>
<v Speaker 1>circle and supposedly there are</v>

2273
01:41:52.080 --> 01:41:53.890
<v Speaker 1>earthquake proof,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tornado proof,</v>

2274
01:41:53.891 --> 01:41:56.350
<v Speaker 1>all this different stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is it.</v>

2275
01:41:56.440 --> 01:41:58.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right there in a dome is the strongest</v>

2276
01:41:58.571 --> 01:42:02.440
<v Speaker 1>structure known to Man Arches after</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

2277
01:42:02.441 --> 01:42:03.580
<v Speaker 1>or volt than the arch.</v>

2278
01:42:04.330 --> 01:42:06.880
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in these exact buildings.</v>

2279
01:42:06.970 --> 01:42:09.960
<v Speaker 1>That's like a hobbit house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What a cool looking little house house.</v>

2280
01:42:10.460 --> 01:42:12.640
<v Speaker 1>It'll back up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I,</v>

2281
01:42:12.850 --> 01:42:16.900
<v Speaker 1>I went there because that's an Aztec</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

2282
01:42:16.901 --> 01:42:20.020
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's that Aztec snake,</v>

2283
01:42:20.290 --> 01:42:21.220
<v Speaker 1>snake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>feathered,</v>

2284
01:42:21.221 --> 01:42:22.570
<v Speaker 1>plumed serpent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

2285
01:42:22.600 --> 01:42:23.740
<v Speaker 1>Costa Rica.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might be,</v>

2286
01:42:24.020 --> 01:42:24.853
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2287
01:42:24.940 --> 01:42:27.280

<v Speaker 1>Cal Earth greenbuild actually level</v>

2288
01:42:27.281 --> 01:42:28.170
<v Speaker 1>those guys there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have,</v>

<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2290
01:42:31.420 --> 01:42:33.250
<v Speaker 1>beliefs of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of how to help people.</v>

2291
01:42:33.640 --> 01:42:34.780
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>slept in the Hudson the first two times</v>

2293
01:42:39.521 --> 01:42:43.360
<v Speaker 1>I went and got rained on and literally</v>
<v Speaker 1>one time woke up in the mud,</v>

2294
01:42:43.361 --> 01:42:46.420
<v Speaker 1>like sunk halfway because it just rained</v>
<v Speaker 1>and rained and rained and rained and we</v>

2295
01:42:46.440 --> 01:42:48.190
<v Speaker 1>were just lying in mud.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2296
01:42:48.191 --> 01:42:52.420
<v Speaker 1>To where it just kept coming through was</v>
<v Speaker 1>just washing down the hill and when my</v>

2297
01:42:52.421 --> 01:42:55.830
<v Speaker 1>wife was there as doing it again and</v>
<v Speaker 1>hold the pygmies get up and uh,</v>

2298
01:42:55.960 --> 01:42:57.790
<v Speaker 1>they came out and I didn't know what</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were doing.</v>

2299
01:42:57.850 --> 01:42:59.380
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought someone was going on because</v>

2300
01:42:59.410 --> 01:43:03.430
<v Speaker 1>everyone was around or hunting circle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm digging this trench so it wouldn't</v>

2301
01:43:03.640 --> 01:43:07.600
<v Speaker 1>come in and get emily wet and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just so caring.</v>

2302
01:43:07.601 --> 01:43:09.550
<v Speaker 1>So awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

2303
01:43:09.580 --> 01:43:11.470
<v Speaker 1>but when I saw the Hud,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those eco domes,</v>

2304
01:43:11.471 --> 01:43:12.730
<v Speaker 1>earth bag homes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

2305
01:43:12.790 --> 01:43:15.070
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's something culturally sound.</v>

2306
01:43:15.370 --> 01:43:18.990
<v Speaker 1>That is something that they would want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to live in because it looks like that I</v>

2307
01:43:18.991 --> 01:43:22.900
<v Speaker 1>looked like their similar and so this is</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that you want to try to</v>

2308
01:43:22.901 --> 01:43:25.960
<v Speaker 1>implement with without a doubt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it has to be the right timing</v>

2309
01:43:25.961 --> 01:43:27.720
<v Speaker 1>because what happened was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2310
01:43:28.020 --> 01:43:28.770
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2311
01:43:28.770 --> 01:43:33.760
<v Speaker 1>I knew pop one in the schools working on</v>
<v Speaker 1>land and I was going to help with that</v>

2312
01:43:33.761 --> 01:43:36.790
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had no clue how to,</v>

2313
01:43:37.030 --> 01:43:38.670
<v Speaker 1>how to get clean water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2314
01:43:39.010 --> 01:43:39.850
<v Speaker 1>I was looking forward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

2315
01:43:39.851 --> 01:43:41.320
<v Speaker 1>I was in my backyard.</v>

2316
01:43:41.560 --> 01:43:44.980
<v Speaker 1>I bought everything from Lowe's back</v>
<v Speaker 1>yard and he was like a website,</v>

2317
01:43:45.090 --> 01:43:49.270
<v Speaker 1>I think literally something like how to</v>
<v Speaker 1>drill your own well.org or something.</v>

2318
01:43:49.660 --> 01:43:52.790
<v Speaker 1>And it's this guy who stand on the back</v>
<v Speaker 1>of his pickup truck and he's,</v>

2319
01:43:53.210 --> 01:43:55.130
<v Speaker 1>he's drilling a well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what I didn't know is that's not</v>

2320
01:43:55.131 --> 01:43:57.860
<v Speaker 1>drinkable water the way he's doing it</v>
<v Speaker 1>and everything else.</v>

2321
01:43:57.861 --> 01:44:01.250
<v Speaker 1>And so I'm in the backyard like five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>$600 of stuff.</v>

2322
01:44:01.340 --> 01:44:03.890
<v Speaker 1>Put Pvc,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to drill my own well by myself.</v>

2323
01:44:04.170 --> 01:44:05.080
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

2324
01:44:05.180 --> 01:44:07.220
<v Speaker 1>trying to learn like me and it's so</v>
<v Speaker 1>hard.</v>

2325
01:44:07.730 --> 01:44:12.020
<v Speaker 1>There's gotta be an easier way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I kinda stepped around that</v>

2326
01:44:12.021 --> 01:44:12.710
<v Speaker 1>because my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

2327
01:44:12.710 --> 01:44:15.230
<v Speaker 1>I can't help them with housing if I go</v>
<v Speaker 1>here and get trained,</v>

2328
01:44:15.950 --> 01:44:18.740
<v Speaker 1>sandbags are cheap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get a couple shovels,</v>

2329
01:44:18.950 --> 01:44:22.160
<v Speaker 1>make some mud and get some cement and</v>
<v Speaker 1>make a plaster to go around it to</v>

2330
01:44:22.161 --> 01:44:23.030
<v Speaker 1>waterproof it better.</v>

2331
01:44:23.340 --> 01:44:24.440
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's gonna work.</v>

2332
01:44:24.470 --> 01:44:27.230
<v Speaker 1>But then when we kind of pastor on how</v>
<v Speaker 1>to make it,</v>

2333
01:44:27.231 --> 01:44:31.490
<v Speaker 1>make it out of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a mix of a cement and um,</v>

2334
01:44:31.550 --> 01:44:33.240
<v Speaker 1>soil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

2335
01:44:33.270 --> 01:44:34.730
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's got the right mixture,</v>

2336
01:44:34.731 --> 01:44:36.870
<v Speaker 1>which I'm forgetting right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2337
01:44:36.980 --> 01:44:41.540
<v Speaker 1>it can be just as strong as or</v>
<v Speaker 1>waterproof as a concreter yeah.</v>

2338
01:44:41.870 --> 01:44:45.260
<v Speaker 1>So it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a really great thing.</v>

2339
01:44:45.261 --> 01:44:47.420
<v Speaker 1>But when I get there and all of a sudden</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see,</v>

2340
01:44:48.050 --> 01:44:48.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

2341
01:44:48.770 --> 01:44:51.170
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first,</v>

2342
01:44:51.171 --> 01:44:52.940
<v Speaker 1>if they don't have any land of their own</v>
<v Speaker 1>than building,</v>

2343
01:44:52.941 --> 01:44:54.920
<v Speaker 1>these things are going to be worthless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone else can move into them.</v>

2344
01:44:55.070 --> 01:44:56.780
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they got to have land.</v>

2345
01:44:56.790 --> 01:44:57.830
<v Speaker 1>Firstly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a process,</v>

2346
01:44:57.831 --> 01:45:01.730
<v Speaker 1>like the most important things land in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the water is water is next then food.</v>

2347
01:45:01.850 --> 01:45:04.100
<v Speaker 1>And then for that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes it can be healthy.</v>

2348
01:45:04.101 --> 01:45:09.101
<v Speaker 1>I want to stay in a sweet spot in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Middle Lane and not spread ourselves too</v>

2349
01:45:09.381 --> 01:45:12.770
<v Speaker 1>thin because you thought about this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but these people that you dealt with in</v>

2350
01:45:12.771 --> 01:45:15.440
<v Speaker 1>California trying to bring them in and</v>
<v Speaker 1>have.</v>

2351
01:45:15.730 --> 01:45:16.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be cool.</v>

2352
01:45:16.620 --> 01:45:19.880
<v Speaker 1>Take over that aspect of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

2353
01:45:19.910 --> 01:45:22.460
<v Speaker 1>that would be cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only thing that we are,</v>

2354
01:45:22.461 --> 01:45:26.480
<v Speaker 1>is we try to be really protective of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>big means.</v>

2355
01:45:26.570 --> 01:45:29.150
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and because uh,</v>

2356
01:45:29.430 --> 01:45:31.560
<v Speaker 1>kind of bringing in a lot of outsiders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2357
01:45:31.760 --> 01:45:36.170
<v Speaker 1>most outsiders that visit them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not a good experience.</v>

2358
01:45:36.171 --> 01:45:38.240
<v Speaker 1>And so just bringing a lot of random</v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

2359
01:45:38.410 --> 01:45:41.060
<v Speaker 1>if it was a couple of people that really</v>
<v Speaker 1>highly skilled,</v>

2360
01:45:41.061 --> 01:45:44.000
<v Speaker 1>had the right hearts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their vision lined up with our vision of</v>

2361
01:45:44.001 --> 01:45:47.090
<v Speaker 1>how we can I do the commute development</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we want to.</v>

2362
01:45:47.330 --> 01:45:48.530
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a great book,</v>

2363
01:45:48.531 --> 01:45:52.520
<v Speaker 1>I think it's called a helping without</v>
<v Speaker 1>hurting or how to help without hurting</v>

2364
01:45:52.521 --> 01:45:56.350
<v Speaker 1>or something like that and have it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you it to them.</v>

2365
01:45:56.870 --> 01:45:58.880
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really great about how you can go</v>

2366
01:45:58.881 --> 01:46:03.881
<v Speaker 1>about helping people in a way that helps</v>
<v Speaker 1>them more than helps you in a way of,</v>

2367
01:46:04.161 --> 01:46:06.580
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people help because it's going</v>

2368
01:46:06.581 --> 01:46:09.770
<v Speaker 1>to make them feel warm and fuzzy and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

2369
01:46:09.930 --> 01:46:12.410
<v Speaker 1>and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you just do that enough for random</v>

2370
01:46:12.411 --> 01:46:13.070
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

2371
01:46:13.070 --> 01:46:15.200
<v Speaker 1>But what if you can make a difference</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

2372
01:46:15.950 --> 01:46:18.050
<v Speaker 1>that lasted longer and it's great to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>both.</v>

2373
01:46:18.051 --> 01:46:19.340
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's great to do both.</v>

2374
01:46:20.270 --> 01:46:24.080
<v Speaker 1>I actually love my.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See someone else do some random act of</v>

2375
01:46:24.081 --> 01:46:24.930
<v Speaker 1>kindness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it,</v>

2376
01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:26.210
<v Speaker 1>it warms my heart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love it.</v>

2377
01:46:26.720 --> 01:46:31.720
<v Speaker 1>But how can we help in a way that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that really changes the game of,</v>

2378
01:46:32.590 --> 01:46:34.330
<v Speaker 1>of things there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2379
01:46:34.440 --> 01:46:36.260
<v Speaker 1>I think you definitely already doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2380
01:46:36.560 --> 01:46:38.060
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're certainly spreading it.</v>

2381
01:46:38.180 --> 01:46:42.090
<v Speaker 1>I think you feel like it's a long job</v>
<v Speaker 1>and your job is not nearly done button.</v>

2382
01:46:42.120 --> 01:46:45.500
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it ever ever will be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh well for water.</v>

2383
01:46:45.501 --> 01:46:47.240
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've definitely hope for that.</v>

2384
01:46:47.241 --> 01:46:48.320
<v Speaker 1>But then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

2385
01:46:48.321 --> 01:46:51.750
<v Speaker 1>I think I just feel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

2386
01:46:51.810 --> 01:46:54.840
<v Speaker 1>whenever he was it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you have that heart connection,</v>

2387
01:46:54.841 --> 01:46:55.920
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2388
01:46:56.190 --> 01:46:59.240
<v Speaker 1>I want to see these people if they have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they have everything I got to like,</v>

2389
01:46:59.280 --> 01:47:02.310
<v Speaker 1>I still want to hang out with them all I</v>
<v Speaker 1>can of course.</v>

2390
01:47:02.340 --> 01:47:03.140
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2391
01:47:03.140 --> 01:47:03.931
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what though?</v>

2392
01:47:03.931 --> 01:47:06.060
<v Speaker 1>It's been really cool to see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2393
01:47:06.480 --> 01:47:11.480
<v Speaker 1>so there's these guys from Uganda that</v>
<v Speaker 1>came in and helped train us in there</v>

2394
01:47:12.031 --> 01:47:15.270
<v Speaker 1>called young men drillers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there were these guys that were,</v>

2395
01:47:15.720 --> 01:47:19.050
<v Speaker 1>you've heard of the LRA and Joseph Kony</v>
<v Speaker 1>and different stuff like that.</v>

2396
01:47:20.100 --> 01:47:23.340
<v Speaker 1>One of the guys was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he told me around a campfire that he was</v>

2397
01:47:23.460 --> 01:47:28.380
<v Speaker 1>one of two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might've been three survivors of a</v>

2398
01:47:28.410 --> 01:47:28.950
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>four,</v>

2399
01:47:28.950 --> 01:47:31.590
<v Speaker 1>500 person village.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The railroads came in,</v>

2400
01:47:31.591 --> 01:47:33.180
<v Speaker 1>killed everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He barely escaped.</v>

2401
01:47:33.270 --> 01:47:35.670
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then another kid and another kid.</v>

2402
01:47:36.320 --> 01:47:41.320
<v Speaker 1>And it's so cool to see these young guys</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden stand up in water for,</v>

2403
01:47:41.371 --> 01:47:44.610
<v Speaker 1>got involved with them and train them up</v>
<v Speaker 1>on how to drill wells in their own</v>

2404
01:47:44.611 --> 01:47:45.720
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And these are,</v>

2405
01:47:45.750 --> 01:47:48.390
<v Speaker 1>when I say young men drillers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I think someone were 16,</v>

2406
01:47:48.391 --> 01:47:49.770

<v Speaker 1>18 when they started,</v>

2407
01:47:50.220 --> 01:47:53.700
<v Speaker 1>well then all of a sudden they cranked</v>
<v Speaker 1>out over 100 water wells over 100 water</v>

2408
01:47:53.701 --> 01:47:54.240
<v Speaker 1>wells.</v>

2409
01:47:54.240 --> 01:47:55.410
<v Speaker 1>They've been doing it longer than we</v>
<v Speaker 1>have.</v>

2410
01:47:55.680 --> 01:47:57.810
<v Speaker 1>We haven't done any.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in the Congo.</v>

2411
01:47:58.710 --> 01:48:01.830
<v Speaker 1>We try to get them out to us to help</v>
<v Speaker 1>matt comes in to train us and to</v>

2412
01:48:01.860 --> 01:48:04.230
<v Speaker 1>continue training with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they were going to leave that</v>

2413
01:48:04.231 --> 01:48:06.470
<v Speaker 1>team.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got the main three guys from him,</v>

2414
01:48:06.480 --> 01:48:11.220
<v Speaker 1>the drillers behind to train us to</v>
<v Speaker 1>invest and impart their knowledge and</v>

2415
01:48:11.221 --> 01:48:12.210
<v Speaker 1>us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2416
01:48:12.480 --> 01:48:16.020
<v Speaker 1>Matt was doing real intensive training</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then these guys are going to stick</v>

2417
01:48:16.021 --> 01:48:18.300
<v Speaker 1>around for the next three months,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make sure we could bust out,</v>

2418
01:48:18.600 --> 01:48:19.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

2419
01:48:19.410 --> 01:48:22.500
<v Speaker 1>a few wells and do it the right way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's so cool.</v>

2420
01:48:22.501 --> 01:48:25.950
<v Speaker 1>They came and stayed with us and so cool</v>
<v Speaker 1>to see what they've gone through all</v>

2421
01:48:25.951 --> 01:48:30.951
<v Speaker 1>that where one of the guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was probably every other night or</v>

2422
01:48:31.081 --> 01:48:34.490
<v Speaker 1>every three nights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's waking up in night terrors where he</v>

2423
01:48:34.491 --> 01:48:35.910
<v Speaker 1>is just screaming.</v>

2424
01:48:35.910 --> 01:48:38.150
<v Speaker 1>And I had never been around that before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2425
01:48:38.151 --> 01:48:41.040
<v Speaker 1>but the things he saw,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things he's been through are just so</v>

2426
01:48:41.041 --> 01:48:44.470
<v Speaker 1>tough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then to see he chose that he's going</v>

2427
01:48:44.471 --> 01:48:46.260
<v Speaker 1>to take a different path.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's gonna,</v>

2428
01:48:46.770 --> 01:48:48.480
<v Speaker 1>he's gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's gonna find something that you can</v>

2429
01:48:48.481 --> 01:48:50.940
<v Speaker 1>help people with in these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to give it to others in a</v>

2430
01:48:50.941 --> 01:48:54.450
<v Speaker 1>different country in Congo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they came and lived with pygmies for</v>

2431
01:48:54.451 --> 01:48:56.220
<v Speaker 1>three years or three months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was awesome.</v>

2432
01:48:56.520 --> 01:49:01.260
<v Speaker 1>Now a ben and a couple of our other</v>
<v Speaker 1>drillers are in Cameroon.</v>

2433
01:49:02.190 --> 01:49:03.060
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

2434
01:49:03.270 --> 01:49:06.000
<v Speaker 1>I kinda had this thing that I haven't</v>
<v Speaker 1>really spoken out,</v>

2435
01:49:06.001 --> 01:49:09.450
<v Speaker 1>but I would love to see the piggies and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Congo.</v>

2436
01:49:09.500 --> 01:49:11.490
<v Speaker 1>I'll have water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then after that,</v>

2437
01:49:11.730 --> 01:49:14.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other pygmies are suffering in very</v>

2438
01:49:14.431 --> 01:49:18.270
<v Speaker 1>similar ways to the pygmies and Congo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what's so cool is that,</v>

2439
01:49:18.360 --> 01:49:19.890
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the young men drillers comes out,</v>

2440

2442
01:49:24.360 --> 01:49:26.490
<v Speaker 1>Their car flipped,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ran over a lady,</v>

2443
01:49:26.730 --> 01:49:28.650
<v Speaker 1>a taxi driver was driving and he ran</v>
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>

2444
01:49:29.040 --> 01:49:30.960
<v Speaker 1>She died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh fuck.</v>

2445
01:49:30.990 --> 01:49:32.910
<v Speaker 1>They ran over a lady.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2446
01:49:32.911 --> 01:49:34.140
<v Speaker 1>they didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The cab driver,</v>

2447
01:49:34.141 --> 01:49:36.420
<v Speaker 1>cab driver did and he bailed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

2448
01:49:36.520 --> 01:49:39.240
<v Speaker 1>he was from Congo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were from Uganda and at the border</v>

2449
01:49:39.330 --> 01:49:41.700
<v Speaker 1>they had to get in with a Congolese taxi</v>
<v Speaker 1>driver,</v>

2450
01:49:42.160 --> 01:49:45.120
<v Speaker 1>who will they do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They couldn't even speak the same</v>

2451
01:49:45.121 --> 01:49:47.470
<v Speaker 1>language and he gets in a wreck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He knows Congo,</v>

2452
01:49:47.620 --> 01:49:49.480
<v Speaker 1>he does that drive all the time to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>border.</v>

2453
01:49:49.720 --> 01:49:54.040
<v Speaker 1>And so he just bales in literally the</v>
<v Speaker 1>people in a place called a new yoga,</v>

2454
01:49:54.520 --> 01:49:59.010
<v Speaker 1>which means a snake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was a place of a rebel group that</v>

2455
01:49:59.050 --> 01:50:01.090
<v Speaker 1>used to be there and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so was very,</v>

01:50:01.091 --> 01:50:04.300
<v Speaker 1>very bad part of town.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's gold mines on both sides of him.</v>

2457
01:50:04.960 --> 01:50:07.870
<v Speaker 1>Luckily this lady took them in and held</v>
<v Speaker 1>him in there and called,</v>

2458
01:50:07.871 --> 01:50:10.540

<v Speaker 1>that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that big heavyweight,</v>

2520
01:52:54.890 --> 01:52:58.130
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is his name in the UFC now?</v>

2521
01:52:58.340 --> 01:53:00.560
<v Speaker 1>A Francis and Francis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2522
01:53:00.800 --> 01:53:05.330
<v Speaker 1>Now he's him in check Congo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Both check on was from Congo,</v>

2523
01:53:06.050 --> 01:53:07.580
<v Speaker 1>I believe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure which one he is from.</v>

2524
01:53:07.590 --> 01:53:11.990
<v Speaker 1>God knows huge dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He is fucking you beast.</v>

2525
01:53:12.080 --> 01:53:15.380
<v Speaker 1>Just a scary guy man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And both those guys ended up in France</v>

2526
01:53:15.381 --> 01:53:19.370
<v Speaker 1>because</v>
<v Speaker 1>the French speaking countries,</v>

2527
01:53:19.790 --> 01:53:22.430
<v Speaker 1>both Congo in Cameroon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's just cool to see how,</v>

2528
01:53:22.670 --> 01:53:27.670
<v Speaker 1>how the trickle effect comes from these</v>
<v Speaker 1>guys that are lucky to be alive then</v>

2529
01:53:28.610 --> 01:53:30.410
<v Speaker 1>from growing up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they're lucky to be alive,</v>

2530
01:53:30.411 --> 01:53:31.430
<v Speaker 1>coming to help us.</v>

2531
01:53:31.550 --> 01:53:35.570
<v Speaker 1>Then they decide to stay in the country</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they're were almost murdered in for</v>

2532
01:53:35.571 --> 01:53:40.370
<v Speaker 1>an extra three months so that we get it</v>
<v Speaker 1>down to where we really know what we're</v>

2533
01:53:40.371 --> 01:53:43.550
<v Speaker 1>doing and then they can go back and we</v>
<v Speaker 1>have this great relationship,</v>

2534
01:53:43.760 --> 01:53:45.800
<v Speaker 1>but now another can come and learn from</v>
<v Speaker 1>us.</v>

2535
01:53:46.130 --> 01:53:49.610
<v Speaker 1>And now we're sending our team out to</v>
<v Speaker 1>different parts of the continent to</v>

2536
01:53:49.670 --> 01:53:54.670
<v Speaker 1>Rwanda to Kenyetta Cameroon to um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think Rwanda,</v>

2537
01:53:55.980 --> 01:54:00.350
<v Speaker 1>Uganda in training up these other teams</v>
<v Speaker 1>have that are wanting to have a desire</v>

2538
01:54:00.620 --> 01:54:01.500
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2539
01:54:02.660 --> 01:54:04.020
<v Speaker 1>to do the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

2540
01:54:04.250 --> 01:54:05.880
<v Speaker 1>a crazy story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2541
01:54:06.030 --> 01:54:06.950
<v Speaker 1>They're so lucky.</v>

2542
01:54:09.020 --> 01:54:11.480
<v Speaker 1>They'll stick them and tires and light</v>
<v Speaker 1>them on fire.</v>

2543
01:54:11.481 --> 01:54:12.314
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw a guy,</v>

2544
01:54:13.100 --> 01:54:17.870
<v Speaker 1>ben and I both saw guy beat to death</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they called him a thief.</v>

2545
01:54:18.220 --> 01:54:19.710
<v Speaker 1>And then rumors were that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2546
01:54:20.720 --> 01:54:23.240
<v Speaker 1>we were kind of far away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I try to get up Kinda,</v>

2547
01:54:23.720 --> 01:54:25.160
<v Speaker 1>Kinda too scary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Close bins.</v>

2548
01:54:25.170 --> 01:54:27.320
<v Speaker 1>Literally pull my shirt away because I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>seeing this,</v>

2549
01:54:28.010 --> 01:54:31.220
<v Speaker 1>know who he is and he's getting beaten</v>
<v Speaker 1>and kicked and most of their stuff.</v>

2550
01:54:31.230 --> 01:54:32.460
<v Speaker 1>But Ben's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>effort,</v>

2551
01:54:32.480 --> 01:54:33.740
<v Speaker 1>we gotta go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we gotta go.</v>

2552
01:54:33.860 --> 01:54:38.810
<v Speaker 1>And so he pulled me away and then when</v>
<v Speaker 1>we came back later I couldn't even bend</v>

2553
01:54:38.811 --> 01:54:41.180
<v Speaker 1>my body like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's like a contortionist kind of</v>

2554
01:54:41.181 --> 01:54:44.030
<v Speaker 1>thing where it was like bent up like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretzel and just laying there.</v>

2555
01:54:44.031 --> 01:54:48.110
<v Speaker 1>And supposedly the rumor was that just</v>
<v Speaker 1>some drunk guys started,</v>

2556
01:54:48.120 --> 01:54:50.930
<v Speaker 1>rumor called him a thief,</v>
<v Speaker 1>called him a thief and when someone says</v>

2557
01:54:50.931 --> 01:54:53.200
<v Speaker 1>thief,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they pounce on the thief.</v>

2558
01:54:54.200 --> 01:54:57.770
<v Speaker 1>And so sometimes it's really a thief or</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

2559
01:54:57.771 --> 01:55:01.100
<v Speaker 1>But then other times it's some innocent</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy in,</v>

2560
01:55:01.610 --> 01:55:02.443
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can.</v>

2561
01:55:02.660 --> 01:55:04.380
<v Speaker 1>Crazy stuff can happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2562
01:55:04.400 --> 01:55:05.810
<v Speaker 1>I can only imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2563
01:55:06.260 --> 01:55:08.360
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

2564
01:55:08.810 --> 01:55:10.220
<v Speaker 1>you've seen some shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

2565
01:55:10.550 --> 01:55:11.570
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's been a,</v>

2566
01:55:12.110 --> 01:55:13.940
<v Speaker 1>it's been different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I wouldn't change it.</v>

2567
01:55:13.941 --> 01:55:15.020
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's beyond.</v>

2568
01:55:15.440 --> 01:55:17.930
<v Speaker 1>It literally is wild.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I couldn't,</v>

2569
01:55:19.220 --> 01:55:20.053
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2570
01:55:20.690 --> 01:55:23.090
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't have dreamed it up for</v>
<v Speaker 1>myself.</v>

2571
01:55:23.091 --> 01:55:24.670
<v Speaker 1>And what's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's kind of funny as them,</v>

2572
01:55:25.160 --> 01:55:26.990
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not funny.</v>

2573
01:55:26.991 --> 01:55:29.270
<v Speaker 1>It's actually a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>have you ever heard of,</v>

2574
01:55:29.480 --> 01:55:33.490
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a book called what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't teach you at Harvard law.</v>

2575
01:55:33.770 --> 01:55:36.290
<v Speaker 1>What they don't teach you at Harvard</v>
<v Speaker 1>business or something like that?</v>

2576
01:55:36.460 --> 01:55:38.180
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the author's name is mark.</v>

2577
01:55:39.270 --> 01:55:41.930
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he did some pretty incredible and I</v>

2578
01:55:41.931 --> 01:55:43.500
<v Speaker 1>heard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I heard about it when I was high school,</v>

2579
01:55:43.890 --> 01:55:46.950
<v Speaker 1>but Kenny Monday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which he got the,</v>

2580
01:55:46.960 --> 01:55:47.970
<v Speaker 1>it came full circle.</v>

2581
01:55:48.080 --> 01:55:51.180
<v Speaker 1>He coached me in high school then for my</v>
<v Speaker 1>comeback fight and he coached me a</v>

2582
01:55:51.181 --> 01:55:54.420
<v Speaker 1>little bit in mma at the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then for my comeback fight and this</v>

2583
01:55:54.421 --> 01:55:56.800
<v Speaker 1>last one he was in my corner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2584
01:55:56.880 --> 01:55:57.780
<v Speaker 1>but anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he told me,</v>

2585
01:55:57.810 --> 01:55:58.231
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

2586
01:55:58.231 --> 01:55:59.970
<v Speaker 1>if you want to wrestle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go home,</v>

2587
01:55:59.971 --> 01:56:03.810
<v Speaker 1>write down your goals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like write them down in this book talks</v>

2588
01:56:03.811 --> 01:56:08.811
<v Speaker 1>about how if they polled some class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some senior class in at Harvard and</v>

2589
01:56:11.461 --> 01:56:16.170
<v Speaker 1>asked who has goals that are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who knows their goals and some like 87</v>

2590
01:56:16.171 --> 01:56:20.250
<v Speaker 1>percent didn't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like besides I'll get my college degree</v>

2591
01:56:20.251 --> 01:56:21.750
<v Speaker 1>from Harvard and then I'll figure it</v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

2592
01:56:22.950 --> 01:56:23.910
<v Speaker 1>Then they asked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who knows,</v>

2593
01:56:23.940 --> 01:56:25.280
<v Speaker 1>who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your um,</v>

2594
01:56:25.440 --> 01:56:29.490
<v Speaker 1>I think that was 87 percent of them or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that and then a or 83</v>

2595
01:56:29.491 --> 01:56:32.790
<v Speaker 1>percent something and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it was,</v>

2596
01:56:33.210 --> 01:56:38.210
<v Speaker 1>it was a 13 percent or something like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that where they had,</v>

2597
01:56:38.311 --> 01:56:40.050
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry I'm screwing this up,</v>

2598
01:56:40.051 --> 01:56:41.850
<v Speaker 1>but it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

2599
01:56:42.960 --> 01:56:44.070
<v Speaker 1>it's an incredible stat.</v>

2600
01:56:44.310 --> 01:56:48.150
<v Speaker 1>It's so 87 or 83 percent didn't know</v>
<v Speaker 1>their goals.</v>

2601
01:56:48.690 --> 01:56:50.790
<v Speaker 1>Thirteen or 17 percent did know their</v>
<v Speaker 1>goals,</v>

2602
01:56:50.791 --> 01:56:54.270
<v Speaker 1>but they didn't have them written down</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then only three percent of the class</v>

2603
01:56:54.510 --> 01:56:57.720
<v Speaker 1>had written concise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>direct goals of what they wanted to do</v>

2604
01:56:57.721 --> 01:57:00.390
<v Speaker 1>in their life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think if you went back 10 years later</v>

2605
01:57:00.930 --> 01:57:03.600
<v Speaker 1>and the ones that had goals but didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>have them written down,</v>

2606
01:57:03.780 --> 01:57:08.610
<v Speaker 1>were making twice as much on average</v>
<v Speaker 1>than all the other 83 or 87 percent that</v>

2607
01:57:08.700 --> 01:57:11.070
<v Speaker 1>didn't have goals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the people had written down</v>

2608
01:57:11.071 --> 01:57:13.200
<v Speaker 1>goals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're making 10 percent,</v>

2609
01:57:13.320 --> 01:57:14.153
<v Speaker 1>10 times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2610
01:57:14.190 --> 01:57:16.320
<v Speaker 1>10 times as all the other 97 combined</v>

2611
01:57:16.630 --> 01:57:20.250
<v Speaker 2>here is why three percent of Harvard</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mbas make 10 times as much as the other.</v>

2612
01:57:20.251 --> 01:57:23.670
<v Speaker 2>Ninety seven.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sarika behind Harvard Mba program is</v>

2613
01:57:23.671 --> 01:57:26.580
<v Speaker 2>extremely competitive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And today admits approximately 15</v>

2614
01:57:26.581 --> 01:57:30.600
<v Speaker 2>percent of the applicants and 19 sixties</v>
<v Speaker 2>acceptance rate was about 30 percent</v>

2615
01:57:30.601 --> 01:57:35.400
<v Speaker 2>down to 25 percent in the 19 seventies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fluctuated between 10 and 15 percent</v>

2616
01:57:35.401 --> 01:57:37.710
<v Speaker 2>ever since.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Students who make it past the</v>

2617
01:57:37.711 --> 01:57:41.460
<v Speaker 2>application process are typically</v>
<v Speaker 2>standouts and already fairly successful</v>

2618
01:57:41.461 --> 01:57:45.030
<v Speaker 2>by most traditional definitions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have an undergraduate degree,</v>

2619
01:57:45.031 --> 01:57:48.660
<v Speaker 2>typically three to five years of working</v>
<v Speaker 2>experience hold on,</v>

2620
01:57:49.080 --> 01:57:51.120
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and when considered suitable for</v>

2621
01:57:51.121 --> 01:57:53.520
<v Speaker 2>acceptance into the Harvard business</v>
<v Speaker 2>school,</v>

2622
01:57:53.521 --> 01:57:53.881
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>

2623
01:57:53.881 --> 01:57:54.181
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>

2624
01:57:54.181 --> 01:57:56.430
<v Speaker 2>blah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2625
01:57:56.730 --> 01:57:58.770
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's explaining about writing your</v>

2626
01:57:58.771 --> 01:58:02.160
<v Speaker 2>goals down and having a clear direction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Make sense</v>

2627
01:58:02.300 --> 01:58:03.133
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

2628
01:58:03.380 --> 01:58:04.620
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

2629
01:58:05.160 --> 01:58:07.020
<v Speaker 1>for me in seeing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hearing that.</v>

2630
01:58:07.440 --> 01:58:12.440
<v Speaker 1>And then having coach Monday tell me</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I'm honestly wrestling MMA,</v>

2631
01:58:12.720 --> 01:58:16.260
<v Speaker 1>having goal to focus on having a gold</v>
<v Speaker 1>write down.</v>

2632
01:58:16.580 --> 01:58:20.670
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that really helped me escape the</v>

2633
01:58:20.671 --> 01:58:24.510
<v Speaker 1>depression for her for a while,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a few years because now I found</v>

2634
01:58:24.511 --> 01:58:26.630
<v Speaker 1>something that I could focus on and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>was passionate about it could,</v>

2635
01:58:26.730 --> 01:58:28.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was my outlet.</v>

2636
01:58:28.680 --> 01:58:31.620
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he also told me one step further,</v>

2637
01:58:32.060 --> 01:58:34.290
<v Speaker 1>think of said this publicly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>publicly.</v>

2638
01:58:34.380 --> 01:58:35.213
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2639
01:58:35.460 --> 01:58:38.630
<v Speaker 1>he told me write down be what's your</v>
<v Speaker 1>goal,</v>

2640
01:58:38.631 --> 01:58:39.870
<v Speaker 1>and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to be a state champion.</v>

2641
01:58:40.770 --> 01:58:41.620
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2642
01:58:41.621 --> 01:58:44.020
<v Speaker 1>go home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>write that down and put it somewhere.</v>

2643
01:58:44.021 --> 01:58:45.610
<v Speaker 1>You can see it either on your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2644
01:58:45.640 --> 01:58:49.210
<v Speaker 1>your bathroom mirror or somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I put it above my bed.</v>

2645
01:58:49.600 --> 01:58:51.910
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't ever write down state</v>

2646
01:58:51.911 --> 01:58:54.920
<v Speaker 1>champion Rodeo national champion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sir.</v>

2647
01:58:54.950 --> 01:58:56.530
<v Speaker 1>Working towards it was state champion</v>
<v Speaker 1>that year,</v>

2648
01:58:56.531 --> 01:58:59.740
<v Speaker 1>the next having a great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great training partner and I'm,</v>

2649
01:58:59.760 --> 01:59:02.860
<v Speaker 1>I'm kind of jazzed up that the Olympics</v>
<v Speaker 1>has coming up into some guys that are</v>

2650
01:59:02.861 --> 01:59:04.720
<v Speaker 1>going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Robby Smith,</v>

2651
01:59:04.721 --> 01:59:06.610
<v Speaker 1>he's a heavyweight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was my roommate at the Olympic</v>

2652
01:59:06.611 --> 01:59:10.960
<v Speaker 1>training center and travail lag if we</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrestled together and high school and</v>

2653
01:59:10.961 --> 01:59:14.290
<v Speaker 1>then after and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm pumped about it.</v>

2654
01:59:14.291 --> 01:59:16.300
<v Speaker 1>But cds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>guys obtaining their goals,</v>

2655
01:59:16.301 --> 01:59:20.530
<v Speaker 1>their dreams and writing them down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll then with coach money's like,</v>

2656
01:59:20.531 --> 01:59:22.420
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get some of your favorite wrestling</v>

2657
01:59:22.421 --> 01:59:25.100
<v Speaker 1>moves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some pictures so you can visualize and I</v>

2658
01:59:25.101 --> 01:59:27.940
<v Speaker 1>just see the words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but see the actual thing that you want</v>

2659
01:59:27.941 --> 01:59:28.900
<v Speaker 1>to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like see it.</v>

2660
01:59:29.890 --> 01:59:33.580
<v Speaker 1>And so I went and I put one wrestling</v>
<v Speaker 1>move on the left and another on the</v>

2661
01:59:33.581 --> 01:59:35.980
<v Speaker 1>right and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and man,</v>

2662
01:59:35.981 --> 01:59:40.981
<v Speaker 1>I just would go to sleep dreaming about</v>
<v Speaker 1>it basically in wake up motivated to,</v>

2663
01:59:41.710 --> 01:59:46.390
<v Speaker 1>to attain that goal national champion</v>
<v Speaker 1>and having a guy that's Olympic gold</v>

2664
01:59:46.391 --> 01:59:48.660
<v Speaker 1>medalist teaching you the basics like</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

2665
01:59:48.670 --> 01:59:50.290
<v Speaker 1>you'll get good quick that way.</v>

2666
01:59:50.320 --> 01:59:55.270
<v Speaker 1>But I'm also having the goals like I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first national championship I won,</v>

2667
01:59:55.740 --> 01:59:58.180
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was with a move on the left and the</v>

2668
01:59:58.181 --> 02:00:00.640
<v Speaker 1>second national championship was with</v>
<v Speaker 1>move on the right.</v>

2669
02:00:00.910 --> 02:00:02.830
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was just,</v>

2670
02:00:02.860 --> 02:00:04.510
<v Speaker 1>it was nuts to see how all that works</v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

2671
02:00:04.511 --> 02:00:06.370
<v Speaker 1>And looking back on this book and seeing</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2672
02:00:06.371 --> 02:00:09.240
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you gotta write down and I,</v>

2673
02:00:09.241 --> 02:00:12.460
<v Speaker 1>I need to update that now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been working on it everything else.</v>

2674
02:00:12.461 --> 02:00:13.810
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of us do.</v>

2675
02:00:14.140 --> 02:00:16.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think focusing on one individual goal</v>

2676
02:00:16.571 --> 02:00:19.660
<v Speaker 1>like that or writing something down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>having a very clear thing that you're</v>

2677
02:00:19.661 --> 02:00:22.390
<v Speaker 1>working towards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It takes away a lot of the ambiguity</v>

2678
02:00:22.391 --> 02:00:25.630
<v Speaker 1>about that people have about wanting to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be successful.</v>

2679
02:00:26.500 --> 02:00:29.110
<v Speaker 1>And I'll just wanting to be successful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just wanting to do well,</v>

2680
02:00:29.290 --> 02:00:31.060
<v Speaker 1>that's not enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to have like a real,</v>

2681
02:00:31.390 --> 02:00:34.210
<v Speaker 1>like something that you're looking</v>
<v Speaker 1>towards something you're moving and</v>

2682
02:00:34.211 --> 02:00:35.980
<v Speaker 1>working towards a plan and initiative.</v>

2683
02:00:35.980 --> 02:00:39.280
<v Speaker 1>And yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's probably one of the biggest</v>

2684
02:00:41.350 --> 02:00:44.070
<v Speaker 1>strengths that our team has.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Has had a,</v>

2685
02:00:44.150 --> 02:00:46.600
<v Speaker 1>the 18 employees we have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2686
02:00:46.720 --> 02:00:51.030
<v Speaker 1>and at water four we write down what we</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to do and it's so cool.</v>

2687
02:00:51.700 --> 02:00:53.850
<v Speaker 1>When I came on the show the first time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2688
02:00:55.270 --> 02:00:58.750
<v Speaker 1>I had gone in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd only experienced the terrible stuff,</v>

2689
02:00:58.780 --> 02:01:03.700
<v Speaker 1>like nothing had happened yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm only corruption and me holding the</v>

2690
02:01:03.701 --> 02:01:07.080
<v Speaker 1>little guy that died and all this just</v>
<v Speaker 1>brutal stuff on.</v>

2691
02:01:07.081 --> 02:01:08.950
<v Speaker 1>But it came back and I finally was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2692
02:01:10.090 --> 02:01:12.940
<v Speaker 1>I can't say no anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to do something.</v>

2693
02:01:13.060 --> 02:01:16.660
<v Speaker 1>And so let's just write it down and do</v>
<v Speaker 1>it and start speaking about it and</v>

2694
02:01:16.661 --> 02:01:19.330
<v Speaker 1>thrown it out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then to see the other team.</v>

2695
02:01:19.331 --> 02:01:20.890
<v Speaker 1>Like they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're coming in with,</v>

2696
02:01:20.920 --> 02:01:22.390
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the real,</v>

2697
02:01:22.420 --> 02:01:24.190
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's The big vision stuff.</v>

2698
02:01:24.400 --> 02:01:26.740
<v Speaker 1>But here's filling in all the details,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how we're going to get it done.</v>

2699
02:01:27.310 --> 02:01:29.560
<v Speaker 1>And me and my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my first time to write things down was</v>

2700
02:01:29.590 --> 02:01:34.030
<v Speaker 1>one water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well on 300 acres of land and maybe we</v>

2701
02:01:34.031 --> 02:01:38.350
<v Speaker 1>could build a school and get a teacher</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they would help with education</v>

2702
02:01:38.351 --> 02:01:41.120
<v Speaker 1>because the pygmies don't have any</v>
<v Speaker 1>representation in the government because</v>

2703
02:01:41.121 --> 02:01:43.880
<v Speaker 1>nobody's educated and that's their</v>
<v Speaker 1>excuse,</v>

2704
02:01:43.881 --> 02:01:47.300
<v Speaker 1>at least in Congo what to here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it was like school,</v>

2705
02:01:47.360 --> 02:01:48.650
<v Speaker 1>that'd be great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One water,</v>

2706
02:01:48.651 --> 02:01:52.370
<v Speaker 1>well and 300 acres.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now it's by the end of this year</v>

2707
02:01:52.371 --> 02:01:55.640
<v Speaker 1>will be 3000 acres of land credible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They literally own,</v>

2708
02:01:55.820 --> 02:01:59.480
<v Speaker 1>there'll be 10 times more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>40th five wells at 45 wells.</v>

2709
02:01:59.510 --> 02:02:01.070
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Teen employees.</v>

2710
02:02:01.510 --> 02:02:04.780
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've got three working farms right over</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's an incredible commitment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

02:02:32.241 --> 02:02:34.160
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty fertile.</v>

2722
02:02:34.190 --> 02:02:35.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can spit a seat on the ground.</v>

2723
02:02:35.681 --> 02:02:38.300
<v Speaker 1>That's gonna gonna Sprout up somehow in</v>

<v Speaker 1>a lot of those trees were doing</v>

2727
02:02:47.991 --> 02:02:50.780
<v Speaker 1>seedlings and they take and they know</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to garden and farm and all that</v>

2728
02:02:50.781 --> 02:02:51.381
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2729
02:02:51.381 --> 02:02:54.110
<v Speaker 1>Especially at the university because</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have a whole agriculture department</v>

2730
02:02:54.140 --> 02:02:56.750
<v Speaker 1>that teams up with the community</v>
<v Speaker 1>development department that they come</v>

2731
02:02:56.751 --> 02:02:59.780
<v Speaker 1>and teach the pygmies how to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They come in and teach them and then</v>

2732
02:03:00.170 --> 02:03:02.150
<v Speaker 1>they start learning how to do it for</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>

2733
02:03:02.240 --> 02:03:06.140
<v Speaker 1>And this was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I can tell you two moments real</v>

2734
02:03:06.141 --> 02:03:11.141
<v Speaker 1>quick where you went back and seeing Leo</v>
<v Speaker 1>May and walking in and seeing all those</v>

2735
02:03:12.500 --> 02:03:14.960
<v Speaker 1>banana trees blew me away.</v>

2736
02:03:14.960 --> 02:03:19.960
<v Speaker 1>And then now there is just so cool</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I was leaving and there's a</v>

2737
02:03:20.961 --> 02:03:23.170
<v Speaker 1>little guy named Ipi than I've seen them</v>
<v Speaker 1>grow up.</v>

2738
02:03:23.180 --> 02:03:25.670
<v Speaker 1>I have watched them grow up and I saw</v>
<v Speaker 1>whenever his,</v>

2739
02:03:26.690 --> 02:03:31.070
<v Speaker 1>his water source was absolutely</v>
<v Speaker 1>disgusting.</v>

2740
02:03:31.160 --> 02:03:35.810
<v Speaker 1>Like you could not ever imagine a human</v>
<v Speaker 1>being drinking,</v>

2741
02:03:36.140 --> 02:03:38.070
<v Speaker 1>drinking it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

2742
02:03:38.120 --> 02:03:40.460
<v Speaker 1>that was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was their water source where they</v>

2743
02:03:40.461 --> 02:03:42.010
<v Speaker 1>get water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is that?</v>

2744
02:03:42.380 --> 02:03:47.060
<v Speaker 1>It's this little stagnant pond kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing with all this mouse over it.</v>

2745
02:03:47.150 --> 02:03:48.620
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>

<v Speaker 1>thick thing.</v>

<v Speaker 1>so let's play this foundations.</v>

2781
02:05:08.520 --> 02:05:12.570
<v Speaker 5>Justin wren versus Josh Barnes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This story of that fight was the time</v>

2782
02:05:12.571 --> 02:05:17.040
<v Speaker 5>off of a very talented fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It been away from the sport for years.</v>

2783
02:05:17.580 --> 02:05:19.380
<v Speaker 5>One of those guys,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when he was active,</v>

2784
02:05:19.590 --> 02:05:21.870
<v Speaker 5>when he was at his peak,</v>
<v Speaker 5>was considered one of the hottest</v>

2785
02:05:21.871 --> 02:05:24.300
<v Speaker 5>prospects in the heavyweight division,</v>
<v Speaker 5>talented wrestler,</v>

2786
02:05:24.330 --> 02:05:25.730
<v Speaker 5>aggressive,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well rounded,</v>

2787
02:05:25.810 --> 02:05:30.100
<v Speaker 5>welcome</v>
<v Speaker 5>at the time off the ring,</v>

2788
02:05:30.101 --> 02:05:32.050
<v Speaker 5>rust,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the time away from the sport against</v>

2789
02:05:32.051 --> 02:05:34.390
<v Speaker 5>Josh Burns,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a guy who traditionally wasn't a very</v>

2790
02:05:34.391 --> 02:05:37.360
<v Speaker 5>fast starter.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We thought he'd have time to warm up and</v>

2791
02:05:37.361 --> 02:05:38.440
<v Speaker 5>he did.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Burns,</v>

2792
02:05:38.441 --> 02:05:40.690
<v Speaker 5>came right after him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A Guy I think was trying to take</v>

2793
02:05:40.691 --> 02:05:44.310
<v Speaker 5>advantage of the fact that rent had been</v>
<v Speaker 5>off for so long ran,</v>

2794
02:05:44.710 --> 02:05:48.310
<v Speaker 5>handled it extremely well.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Rent had been away for a long time,</v>

2795
02:05:48.311 --> 02:05:51.050
<v Speaker 5>so you could see the surprise.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You could see the fatigue,</v>

2796
02:05:51.400 --> 02:05:55.000
<v Speaker 5>you could see the question of himself.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You could see those times when things</v>

2797
02:05:55.001 --> 02:05:56.720
<v Speaker 5>started working out and it started</v>
<v Speaker 5>coming back.</v>

2798
02:05:59.020 --> 02:06:03.100
<v Speaker 5>The story of all his time off was on his</v>
<v Speaker 5>face and his in his performance.</v>

2799
02:06:03.120 --> 02:06:07.660
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's the guy making up for time off in</v>

2800
02:06:07.661 --> 02:06:11.200
<v Speaker 5>one fight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What's easy to forget with Justin wren</v>

2801
02:06:11.201 --> 02:06:15.700
<v Speaker 5>story with him helping out the pygmies</v>
<v Speaker 5>with all he's done socially,</v>

2802
02:06:15.850 --> 02:06:18.190
<v Speaker 5>all he's done politically for that</v>
<v Speaker 5>tribe.</v>

2803
02:06:18.290 --> 02:06:23.290
<v Speaker 5>They can't go in there with me and the</v>
<v Speaker 5>pressure of having a big story on your</v>

2804
02:06:24.941 --> 02:06:26.770
<v Speaker 5>shoulders,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everybody rooting for you,</v>

2805
02:06:26.840 --> 02:06:30.130
<v Speaker 5>everybody reading your book,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's not easy thing to carry into a</v>

2806
02:06:30.131 --> 02:06:32.920
<v Speaker 5>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Every talks about how great the story is</v>

2807
02:06:32.921 --> 02:06:35.020
<v Speaker 5>and what it does for a fighter and what</v>
<v Speaker 5>it does for their career.</v>

2808
02:06:35.380 --> 02:06:39.970
<v Speaker 5>It's also a gigantic burden and not just</v>
<v Speaker 5>fighting for yourself anymore.</v>

2809
02:06:40.330 --> 02:06:42.310
<v Speaker 5>You're fighting for everyone who looks</v>
<v Speaker 5>up to you.</v>

2810
02:06:42.460 --> 02:06:45.220
<v Speaker 5>Winning that night was a big deal for</v>
<v Speaker 5>him.</v>

2811
02:06:45.280 --> 02:06:46.870
<v Speaker 5>People don't understand what he was</v>
<v Speaker 5>carrying.</v>

2812
02:06:47.020 --> 02:06:51.070
<v Speaker 5>He was carrying ring Ross and he was</v>
<v Speaker 5>carrying the hopes and dreams of</v>

2813
02:06:51.100 --> 02:06:53.200
<v Speaker 5>everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was fighting for it and he managed</v>

2814
02:06:53.201 --> 02:06:58.200
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One</v>

2815
02:06:58.200 --> 02:07:01.680
<v Speaker 1>slash 27 real quick and pause it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just one minute,</v>

2816
02:07:01.681 --> 02:07:05.200
<v Speaker 1>27 seconds because I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's great.</v>

2817
02:07:05.290 --> 02:07:06.540
<v Speaker 1>It's right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2818
02:07:06.541 --> 02:07:09.330
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the girls on the left through the cage,</v>

2819
02:07:09.680 --> 02:07:10.770
<v Speaker 1>this is the only time that's ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>happened.</v>

2820
02:07:10.771 --> 02:07:13.380
<v Speaker 1>That's my wife.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is her first fight of mine to ever</v>

2821
02:07:13.710 --> 02:07:16.380
<v Speaker 1>go to or see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we've been together for four or five</v>

2822
02:07:16.381 --> 02:07:17.890
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

2823
02:07:18.420 --> 02:07:22.200

<v Speaker 1>knees right here and this is the ring</v>

2824
02:07:22.201 --> 02:07:24.530
<v Speaker 1>road.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Dominick Cruz can say it's a,</v>

<v Speaker 1>and stubborn and he's away come the</v>

2827
02:07:30.990 --> 02:07:32.610
<v Speaker 1>awesome competitor.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2829
02:07:33.210 --> 02:07:37.090

<v Speaker 1>have turned that had a big factor.</v>

2830
02:07:37.150 --> 02:07:37.691
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And two,</v>

2831
02:07:37.691 --> 02:07:40.800
<v Speaker 1>it was a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one of the ring rust kind of things</v>

2832
02:07:40.810 --> 02:07:41.643
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2833
02:07:42.130 --> 02:07:44.230
<v Speaker 1>I could hear the commentators and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>could,</v>

2834
02:07:44.980 --> 02:07:49.000
<v Speaker 1>I looked out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first person I see is my wife and I</v>

2835
02:07:49.001 --> 02:07:53.110
<v Speaker 1>see her make eye contact with her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like we stared into each other's eyes</v>

2836
02:07:53.410 --> 02:07:55.180
<v Speaker 1>and I know this is gonna sound goofy.</v>

2837
02:07:55.180 --> 02:07:57.640
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she got a new outfit on and I'm just</v>

2845
02:08:08.261 --> 02:08:12.130

<v Speaker 1>almost finished them there with some</v>

02:08:42.190 --> 02:08:43.023
<v Speaker 1>But then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2862
02:08:43.060 --> 02:08:45.280
<v Speaker 1>I meant to show you the one that came</v>
<v Speaker 1>first,</v>

2863
02:08:45.281 --> 02:08:46.360
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2864
02:08:46.990 --> 02:08:50.380
<v Speaker 1>we don't play that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what happened for the first flight</v>

2865
02:08:50.381 --> 02:08:51.910
<v Speaker 1>back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which just kind of nuts that,</v>

2866
02:08:51.911 --> 02:08:54.550
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those guys,</v>

2867
02:08:54.610 --> 02:08:58.120
<v Speaker 1>the guys surprise me and called me in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the morning and I was able to see them</v>

2868
02:08:58.121 --> 02:08:59.860
<v Speaker 1>and they were able to encourage me for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fight and say,</v>

2869
02:08:59.861 --> 02:09:00.071
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2870
02:09:00.071 --> 02:09:02.860
<v Speaker 1>you're fighting for us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All that is really great than emily sent</v>

2871
02:09:02.861 --> 02:09:05.530
<v Speaker 1>me a picture of her with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so awesome.</v>

2872
02:09:05.650 --> 02:09:09.400
<v Speaker 1>Her with like 10 or 12 kids around her</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they all had the biggest smiles.</v>

2873
02:09:09.580 --> 02:09:10.540
<v Speaker 1>She says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>remember,</v>

2874
02:09:12.640 --> 02:09:17.080
<v Speaker 1>remember who you fight for and Wifi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so a lot of pressure.</v>

2875
02:09:18.970 --> 02:09:20.170
<v Speaker 1>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at the same time she,</v>

2876
02:09:20.200 --> 02:09:21.360
<v Speaker 1>she's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's so awesome.</v>

2877
02:09:21.390 --> 02:09:24.220
<v Speaker 1>Loves me and I've some reason I like</v>
<v Speaker 1>pressure.</v>

2878
02:09:25.470 --> 02:09:27.300
<v Speaker 1>I like to be under the gun or something</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

2879
02:09:27.640 --> 02:09:28.570
<v Speaker 1>What's next for you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man?</v>

2880
02:09:29.260 --> 02:09:30.520
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think um,</v>

2881
02:09:33.310 --> 02:09:36.850
<v Speaker 1>I think I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we just got pretty much settled into</v>

2882
02:09:36.910 --> 02:09:41.910
<v Speaker 1>Colorado and joining them and may seen</v>
<v Speaker 1>up there kind of a team take down was</v>

2883
02:09:43.031 --> 02:09:45.700
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It kind of dissolved and I'm team</v>

2884
02:09:45.701 --> 02:09:50.560
<v Speaker 1>takedown dissolved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You sort of just Johnny Hendricks left.</v>

2885
02:09:50.561 --> 02:09:53.050
<v Speaker 1>Is that what he's not on there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But once you left,</v>

2886
02:09:53.370 --> 02:09:56.320
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the coaches are gone.</v>

2887
02:09:56.410 --> 02:09:58.600
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that came in from out of state and that</v>

2888
02:09:58.630 --> 02:09:59.740
<v Speaker 1>was a weird situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2889
02:09:59.741 --> 02:10:03.310
<v Speaker 1>It was some wealthy guy was financing</v>
<v Speaker 1>the entire thing,</v>

2890
02:10:03.311 --> 02:10:03.821
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One.</v>

2891
02:10:03.821 --> 02:10:04.600
<v Speaker 1>And he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a,</v>

2892
02:10:04.600 --> 02:10:05.740
<v Speaker 1>he's a great dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then uh,</v>

2893
02:10:05.920 --> 02:10:07.960
<v Speaker 1>and then he brought in a bunch of other</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

2894
02:10:07.961 --> 02:10:11.200
<v Speaker 1>But I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think for them it was just a,</v>

2895
02:10:11.340 --> 02:10:14.130
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they might've got burned every,</v>

2896
02:10:14.170 --> 02:10:18.240
<v Speaker 1>well they had a deal right where they</v>
<v Speaker 1>would pay guys a salary and then salary</v>

2897
02:10:18.250 --> 02:10:20.680
<v Speaker 1>require your rent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your groceries.</v>

2898
02:10:20.730 --> 02:10:24.190
<v Speaker 1>But when you won you were supposed to</v>
<v Speaker 1>give them a percentage of your winnings.</v>

2899
02:10:24.191 --> 02:10:25.890
<v Speaker 1>I think it was 50 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>50,</v>

2900
02:10:26.330 --> 02:10:28.810
<v Speaker 1>50 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you get your house payment,</v>

2901
02:10:28.811 --> 02:10:31.180
<v Speaker 1>your car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your insurance and health insurance.</v>

2902
02:10:31.181 --> 02:10:32.230
<v Speaker 1>You get your gross.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>

2903
02:10:32.320 --> 02:10:34.880
<v Speaker 1>Until fighters making,</v>
<v Speaker 1>making 10 million bucks.</v>

2904
02:10:35.060 --> 02:10:35.910
<v Speaker 1>And they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

2905
02:10:36.660 --> 02:10:37.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's very true.</v>

2906
02:10:37.940 --> 02:10:40.010
<v Speaker 1>Because if they're only spending 50 or</v>
<v Speaker 1>70 years,</v>

2907
02:10:40.020 --> 02:10:41.770
<v Speaker 1>who will agree to that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>To Johnny Hendricks?</v>

2908
02:10:41.780 --> 02:10:42.613
<v Speaker 1>Agree to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2909
02:10:42.880 --> 02:10:44.900
<v Speaker 1>So he was giving 50 percent of his</v>
<v Speaker 1>purse.</v>

2910
02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:47.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think most every team takedown guy was</v>

2911
02:10:47.990 --> 02:10:49.340
<v Speaker 1>a johnny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>might've been a little.</v>

2912
02:10:49.341 --> 02:10:51.530
<v Speaker 1>I think it might've been a little</v>
<v Speaker 1>different than everybody else's.</v>

2913
02:10:51.540 --> 02:10:53.960
<v Speaker 1>Like a crazy deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And how much were they paying?</v>

2914
02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:55.530
<v Speaker 1>Not Love.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love all the guys there.</v>

2915
02:10:55.850 --> 02:10:57.470
<v Speaker 1>They're awesome dudes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

2916
02:10:57.860 --> 02:11:02.330
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't even want to quote it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I know over 50,</v>

2917
02:11:02.390 --> 02:11:04.580
<v Speaker 1>maybe under $100 a year.</v>

2918
02:11:04.750 --> 02:11:06.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

2919
02:11:06.860 --> 02:11:09.650
<v Speaker 1>well that's a good investment if you get</v>
<v Speaker 1>5 million bucks back,</v>

2920
02:11:09.740 --> 02:11:10.551
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's true.</v>

2921
02:11:10.551 --> 02:11:11.510
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was,</v>

2922
02:11:11.511 --> 02:11:13.430
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it didn't work out because when Johnny</v>

2923
02:11:13.431 --> 02:11:14.750
<v Speaker 1>started making real money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's when he.</v>

2924
02:11:15.780 --> 02:11:17.390
<v Speaker 1>Is that when he left or was there other</v>
<v Speaker 1>issues?</v>

2925
02:11:17.680 --> 02:11:18.650
<v Speaker 1>I think it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

2926
02:11:18.710 --> 02:11:19.880
<v Speaker 1>it was that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I think,</v>

2927
02:11:19.881 --> 02:11:22.460
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think internally there was some,</v>

2928
02:11:22.710 --> 02:11:26.810
<v Speaker 1>some butting of heads between a few</v>
<v Speaker 1>different people between me,</v>

2929
02:11:26.870 --> 02:11:28.250
<v Speaker 1>maybe coaches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe management,</v>

2930
02:11:28.251 --> 02:11:30.440
<v Speaker 1>maybe fighters too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

2931
02:11:30.680 --> 02:11:32.390
<v Speaker 1>so now you're in Colorado.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm in Colorado.</v>

2932
02:11:32.570 --> 02:11:37.570
<v Speaker 1>Were you trained in Colorado a while?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Be My home gym will be Grudge Training</v>

2933
02:11:38.120 --> 02:11:39.800
<v Speaker 1>Center,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is actually pretty cool.</v>

2934
02:11:39.801 --> 02:11:42.320
<v Speaker 1>There's a instructor named drew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty great.</v>

2935
02:11:42.430 --> 02:11:44.360
<v Speaker 1>He came in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he opened,</v>

2936
02:11:44.420 --> 02:11:46.790
<v Speaker 1>I think he opened up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe I'm wrong on that one,</v>

2937
02:11:46.791 --> 02:11:50.780
<v Speaker 1>but 10th planet Jiu Jitsu and I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>boulder,</v>

2938
02:11:50.781 --> 02:11:53.270
<v Speaker 1>but now he has one in Arvada which is</v>
<v Speaker 1>inside of grudge.</v>

2939
02:11:53.360 --> 02:11:55.450
<v Speaker 1>And so now we had a 10th planet in there</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's,</v>

2940
02:11:55.490 --> 02:12:00.490
<v Speaker 1>he's actually so in some slick darce</v>
<v Speaker 1>jokes and uh,</v>

2941
02:12:00.710 --> 02:12:02.000
<v Speaker 1>and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's awesome.</v>

2942
02:12:02.250 --> 02:12:05.420
<v Speaker 1>Some stuff that's his belt too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a fight lined up for you maybe,</v>

2943
02:12:05.540 --> 02:12:07.280
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe November,</v>

2944
02:12:07.281 --> 02:12:10.730
<v Speaker 1>December where we're looking at that and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing that I want to do is getting a</v>

2945
02:12:10.731 --> 02:12:14.060
<v Speaker 1>real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't given myself time to settle,</v>

2946
02:12:14.061 --> 02:12:19.061
<v Speaker 1>to really train to really focus and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>know that now it's a time crunch,</v>

2947
02:12:20.060 --> 02:12:21.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>29.</v>

2948
02:12:21.830 --> 02:12:25.610
<v Speaker 1>I know that the youngest heavyweight I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think is still jds and junior.</v>

2949
02:12:25.611 --> 02:12:28.850
<v Speaker 1>Dos Santos and I'm in the top 10.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's 32.</v>

2950
02:12:29.750 --> 02:12:34.750
<v Speaker 1>I mean Barnett's I think 38 and time to</v>
<v Speaker 1>mature later.</v>

2951
02:12:35.910 --> 02:12:38.240
<v Speaker 1>Forty two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well Brock has pretty much done now.</v>

2952
02:12:38.690 --> 02:12:42.360
<v Speaker 1>I think that last positive tests to</v>
<v Speaker 1>positive tests in a row.</v>

2953
02:12:43.010 --> 02:12:45.080
<v Speaker 1>He got one before the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One after the fight.</v>

2954
02:12:45.170 --> 02:12:47.680
<v Speaker 1>It's most likely one and done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

02:12:50.550 --> 02:12:52.700
<v Speaker 1>You thinking about going to the UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I have thoroughly appreciated how</v>

2960
02:13:01.990 --> 02:13:03.860
<v Speaker 1>they've been treating me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've been.</v>

2961
02:13:04.100 --> 02:13:07.010
<v Speaker 1>But you're mentioning all these MMA</v>
<v Speaker 1>fighters from the UFC.</v>

<v Speaker 1>are you thinking about going over there?</v>

2963
02:13:08.901 --> 02:13:12.920

<v Speaker 1>I would never be against that because I</v>

2964
02:13:12.921 --> 02:13:16.010
<v Speaker 1>love the UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Love MMA and that's a big,</v>

2965
02:13:16.011 --> 02:13:18.200
<v Speaker 1>big platform.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How long has your deal at bell or four?</v>

2966

02:13:25.460 --> 02:13:29.660
<v Speaker 1>I mean reason we're in Colorado.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First is I wanted to get my wrestling</v>

2969
02:13:29.661 --> 02:13:32.250
<v Speaker 1>back because I'm pretty disappointed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My first two,</v>

2970
02:13:32.480 --> 02:13:37.480
<v Speaker 1>I honestly winning this was the first</v>
<v Speaker 1>two times winning felt really good</v>

2971
02:13:38.250 --> 02:13:39.510
<v Speaker 1>because I did it.</v>

2972
02:13:39.690 --> 02:13:42.630
<v Speaker 1>I didn't do it for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then the same time right away the</v>

2973
02:13:42.631 --> 02:13:45.330
<v Speaker 1>competitor comes in and is like messed</v>

2975
02:13:45.631 --> 02:13:46.460
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>

2976
02:13:46.460 --> 02:13:49.380
<v Speaker 1>and I think pretty much every guy taking</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ground finished.</v>

2977
02:13:49.381 --> 02:13:51.570
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why am I trying to outbox the boxers</v>

2978
02:13:51.900 --> 02:13:53.490
<v Speaker 1>whenever I need to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to wrestle.</v>

2979
02:13:53.550 --> 02:13:55.890
<v Speaker 1>You need to take them down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it difficult for you to balance the</v>

2980
02:13:55.891 --> 02:13:57.420
<v Speaker 1>two worlds?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you know,</v>

2981
02:13:57.421 --> 02:14:00.630
<v Speaker 1>you have one that demands incredible</v>
<v Speaker 1>attention,</v>

2982
02:14:00.640 --> 02:14:04.140
<v Speaker 1>your fighting career demands incredible</v>
<v Speaker 1>attention and then you have the other</v>

2983
02:14:04.141 --> 02:14:09.141
<v Speaker 1>that also demands incredible attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have an amazing commitment to these</v>

2984
02:14:09.421 --> 02:14:13.830
<v Speaker 1>pygmy people and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this incredible passion and love for it.</v>

2985
02:14:13.890 --> 02:14:18.890
<v Speaker 1>But then you also have your urine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the date most dangerous combat sport in</v>

2986
02:14:19.111 --> 02:14:20.310
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2987
02:14:20.340 --> 02:14:22.800
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it requires massive attention.</v>

2988
02:14:22.801 --> 02:14:24.450
<v Speaker 1>Like we were talking about Francisca.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2989
02:14:24.690 --> 02:14:29.190
<v Speaker 1>like if you're gonna Fight Francis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now you got a fucking batten down the</v>

2990
02:14:29.191 --> 02:14:29.700
<v Speaker 1>hatches.</v>

2991
02:14:29.700 --> 02:14:33.570
<v Speaker 1>You got to be in incredible shape and</v>
<v Speaker 1>for being consistent,</v>

2992
02:14:34.260 --> 02:14:37.270
<v Speaker 1>dedicated and no excuses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

2993
02:14:37.530 --> 02:14:41.400
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what left a pretty sour taste in</v>

2994
02:14:41.401 --> 02:14:45.780
<v Speaker 1>my mouth after these last two fights</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I knew I hate doing that.</v>

2995
02:14:45.781 --> 02:14:48.810
<v Speaker 1>Like a rushing it or getting in whenever</v>
<v Speaker 1>prepared.</v>

2996
02:14:48.811 --> 02:14:51.300
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you training at all when you're in</v>

2997
02:14:51.301 --> 02:14:53.490
<v Speaker 1>the Congo and how often do you end the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Congo?</v>

2998
02:14:53.550 --> 02:14:57.570
<v Speaker 1>A now I'm now I'm going to start going</v>
<v Speaker 1>back just after every fight.</v>

2999
02:14:57.740 --> 02:14:59.970
<v Speaker 1>When I fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go back for a couple of weeks.</v>

3000
02:15:00.060 --> 02:15:02.550
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to be real safe this time it</v>
<v Speaker 1>took my own food.</v>

3001
02:15:02.820 --> 02:15:06.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm like all of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like an entire check bag was just kind</v>

3002
02:15:06.961 --> 02:15:10.650
<v Speaker 1>bars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lara bars and all these different green</v>

3003
02:15:10.651 --> 02:15:12.150
<v Speaker 1>smoothies and different stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I was,</v>

3004
02:15:12.151 --> 02:15:13.740
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't even eating any food,</v>

3005
02:15:13.741 --> 02:15:16.020
<v Speaker 1>they're still got sick and so had</v>
<v Speaker 1>malaria.</v>

3006
02:15:16.020 --> 02:15:19.600
<v Speaker 1>Then after that I got shingles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is crazy.</v>

3007
02:15:20.310 --> 02:15:23.280
<v Speaker 1>It was completely across my forehead and</v>
<v Speaker 1>over here.</v>

3008
02:15:23.281 --> 02:15:25.920
<v Speaker 1>So there's like the middle of the trip</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's coming back at case,</v>

3009
02:15:26.150 --> 02:15:27.810
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that like kind of a herpes,</v>

3010
02:15:28.140 --> 02:15:33.140
<v Speaker 1>a it chick?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the adult form of the chicken pox.</v>

3011
02:15:33.760 --> 02:15:35.530
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's brutal.</v>

3012
02:15:35.531 --> 02:15:37.860
<v Speaker 1>Like it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a different pain than I've ever</v>

3013
02:15:37.861 --> 02:15:42.750
<v Speaker 1>felt because it's a nerve pain and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>was out in the forest and there was a</v>

3014
02:15:43.260 --> 02:15:44.071
<v Speaker 1>couple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>

3015
02:15:44.071 --> 02:15:47.820
<v Speaker 1>three days where we were there for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>documentary,</v>

3016
02:15:47.821 --> 02:15:49.140
<v Speaker 1>for the water wells,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything else.</v>

3017
02:15:49.141 --> 02:15:53.100
<v Speaker 1>And we got a team that came and so we</v>
<v Speaker 1>gotta we gotta get it done.</v>

3018
02:15:53.101 --> 02:15:57.000
<v Speaker 1>So I kind of stayed back a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 1>days but then while we're out there in</v>

3019
02:15:57.001 --> 02:15:59.100
<v Speaker 1>different stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a rebel group actually came,</v>

3020
02:15:59.101 --> 02:16:04.101
<v Speaker 1>like I believe it was three miles from</v>
<v Speaker 1>us and only about a mile away from our</v>

3021
02:16:05.191 --> 02:16:07.650
<v Speaker 1>truck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I'm sick.</v>

3022
02:16:08.040 --> 02:16:11.520
<v Speaker 1>I can't get back to the hospital that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>just came out of from getting treatment</v>

3023
02:16:11.521 --> 02:16:15.150
<v Speaker 1>for malaria to get treatment for</v>
<v Speaker 1>shingles and then,</v>

3024
02:16:15.151 --> 02:16:16.470
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that was tough,</v>

3025
02:16:17.070 --> 02:16:20.190
<v Speaker 1>but for me to answer your question like</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to be,</v>

3026
02:16:21.030 --> 02:16:24.390
<v Speaker 1>I want to be realistic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at the same time a quote my mom</v>

3027
02:16:24.391 --> 02:16:26.250
<v Speaker 1>taught me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forget who it was,</v>

3028
02:16:26.251 --> 02:16:27.570
<v Speaker 1>but she said something like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3029
02:16:28.370 --> 02:16:33.370
<v Speaker 1>I'm an optimist is someone who goes</v>
<v Speaker 1>after moby Dick in a rowboat and takes</v>

3030
02:16:34.271 --> 02:16:35.210
<v Speaker 1>the tartar sauce with them.</v>

3031
02:16:38.360 --> 02:16:43.300
<v Speaker 1>Optimists goes after moby Dick in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>rowboat and takes the tartar sauce with</v>

3032
02:16:43.301 --> 02:16:44.620
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for me,</v>

3033
02:16:44.621 --> 02:16:47.200
<v Speaker 1>I want to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to swing for the fences,</v>

3034
02:16:47.530 --> 02:16:50.110
<v Speaker 1>make the biggest impact possible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at the same time,</v>

3035
02:16:50.111 --> 02:16:52.660
<v Speaker 1>like we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're restructuring stuff.</v>

3036
02:16:52.661 --> 02:16:55.870
<v Speaker 1>We had meetings at water four and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think just getting everyone on the same</v>

3037
02:16:55.871 --> 02:16:56.830
<v Speaker 1>page.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well me too,</v>

3038
02:16:56.831 --> 02:17:01.360
<v Speaker 1>because I was listening to the biggest</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing possible is the UFC heavyweight</v>

3039
02:17:01.361 --> 02:17:02.740
<v Speaker 1>championship now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>without a doubt.</v>

3040
02:17:02.950 --> 02:17:06.100
<v Speaker 1>Is that a first ballot where then UFC or</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that a thought that you have in your</v>

3041
02:17:06.101 --> 02:17:08.270
<v Speaker 1>mind with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well yeah,</v>

3042
02:17:08.271 --> 02:17:11.680
<v Speaker 1>the one will be on one of those goals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3043
02:17:11.740 --> 02:17:16.180
<v Speaker 1>At UFC 200 is good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sound goofy to anybody else.</v>

3044
02:17:16.181 --> 02:17:17.920
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of athletes would probably</v>
<v Speaker 1>get it,</v>

3045
02:17:18.220 --> 02:17:20.230
<v Speaker 1>some might not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

3046
02:17:20.290 --> 02:17:22.990
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bought a UFC replica belt because,</v>

3047
02:17:22.991 --> 02:17:23.824
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to,</v>

3048
02:17:23.920 --> 02:17:26.620
<v Speaker 1>I'm not gonna hang it or anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I want to have times where I set</v>

3049
02:17:26.621 --> 02:17:29.530
<v Speaker 1>that down on a table or a desk and look</v>
<v Speaker 1>at it,</v>

3050
02:17:29.531 --> 02:17:32.830
<v Speaker 1>think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dream about it and know that before I go</v>

3051
02:17:32.831 --> 02:17:34.630
<v Speaker 1>out the door training,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3052
02:17:34.680 --> 02:17:35.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

3053
02:17:35.350 --> 02:17:36.340
<v Speaker 1>that's a goal of mine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3054
02:17:36.341 --> 02:17:41.170
<v Speaker 1>if I could get there then I know this</v>
<v Speaker 1>fight for the forgotten can be set up</v>

3055
02:17:41.171 --> 02:17:42.180
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3056
02:17:42.190 --> 02:17:43.960
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe the rest of,</v>

3057
02:17:44.130 --> 02:17:45.790
<v Speaker 1>of my life there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3058
02:17:45.820 --> 02:17:49.010
<v Speaker 1>it could keep going on and on further</v>
<v Speaker 1>than it would if I didn't.</v>

3059
02:17:49.070 --> 02:17:51.490
<v Speaker 1>Realistically to try to attain that sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a goal.</v>

3060
02:17:51.730 --> 02:17:54.190
<v Speaker 1>Like it's going to require more than</v>
<v Speaker 1>just staring at a belt or writing</v>

3061
02:17:54.191 --> 02:17:56.440
<v Speaker 1>something down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're gonna you're gonna need to go on</v>

3062
02:17:56.441 --> 02:17:57.610

<v Speaker 1>sports agent to lawyers and I'm just,</v>

<v Speaker 1>all these people are incredible.</v>

3068

<v Speaker 1>a conference table like this.</v>

3069
02:18:16.661 --> 02:18:17.730

3073
02:18:28.070 --> 02:18:30.420

<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

3099
02:19:32.500 --> 02:19:34.640

<v Speaker 1>Olympics and stuff and um,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here it is.</v>

02:19:39.020 --> 02:19:40.010
<v Speaker 1>This guy's a beast.</v>

3103
02:19:43.270 --> 02:19:44.500
<v Speaker 1>We're not hearing anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jeremy.</v>

3104
02:19:45.050 --> 02:19:46.650
<v Speaker 4>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She got into wrestling.</v>

3105
02:19:46.651 --> 02:19:51.651
<v Speaker 4>So I was in high school.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was a point when I'm starting to</v>

3106
02:19:51.661 --> 02:19:54.840
<v Speaker 4>getting into a little bit of trouble and</v>
<v Speaker 4>just hanging out with the wrong crowd.</v>

3107
02:19:56.010 --> 02:19:58.500
<v Speaker 4>My wrestling coach,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's the one that Kinda put me back on</v>

3108
02:19:58.501 --> 02:20:01.800
<v Speaker 4>the right track.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He taught me what work ethic was.</v>

3109
02:20:04.890 --> 02:20:07.800
<v Speaker 4>I try to be the guy who motivates</v>
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>

3110
02:20:07.860 --> 02:20:11.340
<v Speaker 4>pushes people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The most peer moment of my athletic</v>

3111
02:20:11.341 --> 02:20:14.990
<v Speaker 4>career is 100 percent the Olympics.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even though I didn't win,</v>

3112
02:20:14.991 --> 02:20:19.020
<v Speaker 4>I still was on that podium representing</v>
<v Speaker 4>my country for the sport that I put so</v>

3113
02:20:19.021 --> 02:20:22.370
<v Speaker 4>many hours into.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That feeling is indescribable.</v>

3114
02:20:22.740 --> 02:20:24.360
<v Speaker 1>And the point is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the guy you're,</v>

3115
02:20:24.680 --> 02:20:26.370
<v Speaker 1>you're working with or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3116
02:20:26.371 --> 02:20:28.050
<v Speaker 1>And sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I probably should have set that up a</v>

3117
02:20:28.051 --> 02:20:31.470
<v Speaker 1>little better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this guy is an absolute monster and</v>

3118
02:20:31.471 --> 02:20:32.540
<v Speaker 1>we've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

3119
02:20:32.550 --> 02:20:34.140
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're getting together and starting to.</v>

3120
02:20:34.350 --> 02:20:37.060
<v Speaker 1>We're going to start working out and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's at Prime Jujitsu,</v>

3121
02:20:37.090 --> 02:20:39.450
<v Speaker 1>knew in Colorado Springs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they cross train with eastern's and</v>

3122
02:20:39.900 --> 02:20:42.240
<v Speaker 1>here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm all over the place,</v>

3123
02:20:42.241 --> 02:20:45.240
<v Speaker 1>but he is the only guy to be trained.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're all jumping.</v>

3124
02:20:45.580 --> 02:20:49.020
<v Speaker 1>Do Squat jumps a row by row with these</v>
<v Speaker 1>bleachers.</v>

3125
02:20:49.440 --> 02:20:52.860
<v Speaker 1>And I promise he's skipping one at least</v>
<v Speaker 1>and sometimes too.</v>

3126
02:20:53.010 --> 02:20:54.660
<v Speaker 1>And he just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was flying up there.</v>

3127
02:20:54.661 --> 02:20:56.880
<v Speaker 1>People be halfway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three quarters of the way.</v>

3128
02:20:56.881 --> 02:21:00.990
<v Speaker 1>This guy is six foot four,</v>
<v Speaker 1>235 pounds solid muscle freakish</v>

3129
02:21:01.080 --> 02:21:02.350
<v Speaker 1>athlete.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

3130
02:21:02.430 --> 02:21:04.520
<v Speaker 1>he's just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a training partner for</v>

3131
02:21:04.540 --> 02:21:06.900
<v Speaker 1>training partner so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I guess what I was trying to allude</v>

3132
02:21:06.901 --> 02:21:11.010
<v Speaker 1>to is me and I feel like how water</v>
<v Speaker 1>forests around me with such an</v>

3133
02:21:11.011 --> 02:21:16.011
<v Speaker 1>incredible team to achieve success that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we fight for the forgotten in now and</v>

3134
02:21:16.411 --> 02:21:18.000
<v Speaker 1>really trying to do that with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3135
02:21:18.210 --> 02:21:22.410
<v Speaker 1>with fighting because if I don't then</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna fail and I'll be wasting time.</v>

3136
02:21:22.770 --> 02:21:24.310
<v Speaker 1>But if I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause this isn't a,</v>

3137
02:21:25.490 --> 02:21:26.910
<v Speaker 1>it's not a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not patty cake,</v>

3138
02:21:26.911 --> 02:21:27.780
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we're,</v>

3139
02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:31.760
<v Speaker 1>we're going in there and we're throwing</v>
<v Speaker 1>down and I've got my head on straight.</v>

3140
02:21:31.990 --> 02:21:33.990
<v Speaker 1>You as you move up in competition for</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

3141
02:21:33.991 --> 02:21:35.160
<v Speaker 1>Without a doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3142
02:21:35.340 --> 02:21:39.780
<v Speaker 1>when you're looking at the competition</v>
<v Speaker 1>you faced in beltour there good steps.</v>

3143
02:21:40.010 --> 02:21:43.740
<v Speaker 1>It's tough guys to fight against their.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're good steps.</v>

3144
02:21:44.010 --> 02:21:46.440
<v Speaker 1>But if you were the timing of</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

3145
02:21:46.650 --> 02:21:47.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

3146
02:21:47.851 --> 02:21:48.340
<v Speaker 1>If I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

3147
02:21:48.340 --> 02:21:50.090
<v Speaker 1>it's A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3148
02:21:50.100 --> 02:21:51.630
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>

3149
02:21:52.890 --> 02:21:55.800
<v Speaker 1>I guess a swinging for the fences are</v>
<v Speaker 1>taking the tartar sauce with me.</v>

3150
02:21:56.010 --> 02:21:57.060
<v Speaker 1>If I see that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3151
02:21:58.260 --> 02:22:00.030
<v Speaker 1>that it's not going to happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you know,</v>

3152
02:22:01.260 --> 02:22:04.200
<v Speaker 1>I hate saying that because I want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>fight so bad,</v>

3153
02:22:04.350 --> 02:22:06.630
<v Speaker 1>but fight for the forgotten is more</v>
<v Speaker 1>important in a way.</v>

3154
02:22:06.810 --> 02:22:10.140
<v Speaker 1>But I mean I think it's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really do and I think,</v>

3155
02:22:11.370 --> 02:22:13.530
<v Speaker 1>I think it's possible to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you've also brought a lot of</v>

3156
02:22:13.531 --> 02:22:17.910
<v Speaker 1>people in to help you with fight for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>forgotten to pick up the slack as well</v>

3157
02:22:18.180 --> 02:22:21.120
<v Speaker 1>and you've started a movement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's a lot going on here</v>

3158
02:22:21.121 --> 02:22:25.080
<v Speaker 1>besides just your involvement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've started this movement and being</v>

3159
02:22:25.440 --> 02:22:26.370
<v Speaker 1>with water for</v>

3160
02:22:26.380 --> 02:22:29.880
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and writing the book and letting people</v>

3161
02:22:29.881 --> 02:22:34.290
<v Speaker 2>know about on these podcasts and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and educating people to what your goal</v>

3162
02:22:34.291 --> 02:22:36.270
<v Speaker 2>is and what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you've been able to accomplish over</v>

3163
02:22:36.271 --> 02:22:37.770
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He started a movement.</v>

3164
02:22:37.771 --> 02:22:41.100
<v Speaker 2>So I think man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you really can do it,</v>

3165
02:22:41.400 --> 02:22:45.750
<v Speaker 2>it would be absolutely incredible and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>certainly would shine even more light if</v>

3166
02:22:45.751 --> 02:22:49.800
<v Speaker 2>you could really become successful as an</v>
<v Speaker 2>MMA fighter from here on out.</v>

3167
02:22:50.190 --> 02:22:50.451
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3168
02:22:50.451 --> 02:22:53.390
<v Speaker 1>I agree with that with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's going to require everything</v>

3169
02:22:53.580 --> 02:22:56.100
<v Speaker 1>requires everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I feel like there's,</v>

3170
02:22:56.220 --> 02:23:00.110
<v Speaker 1>there's two parts of this where I'm mean</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3171
02:23:00.840 --> 02:23:03.690
<v Speaker 1>the fight for the forgotten guy in me</v>
<v Speaker 1>wants to be,</v>

3172
02:23:04.670 --> 02:23:06.480
<v Speaker 1>wants to be humble and everything will</v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

3173
02:23:06.530 --> 02:23:07.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not going to happen.</v>

3174
02:23:07.681 --> 02:23:10.560
<v Speaker 1>Listen to all the right things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the same on the other side of</v>

3175
02:23:10.561 --> 02:23:13.620
<v Speaker 1>the coin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I'm a at the same time.</v>

3176
02:23:13.740 --> 02:23:18.570
<v Speaker 1>I feel like if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I can just get the time,</v>

3177
02:23:18.630 --> 02:23:20.650
<v Speaker 1>I haven't been getting the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3178
02:23:20.910 --> 02:23:22.170
<v Speaker 1>to train.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And</v>

3179
02:23:23.790 --> 02:23:25.800
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that you have to make</v>
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>

3180
02:23:25.820 --> 02:23:27.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have to make the time and it's got to</v>

3181
02:23:27.391 --> 02:23:30.450
<v Speaker 1>be the priority.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't think I,</v>

3182
02:23:30.690 --> 02:23:35.070
<v Speaker 1>it can't be some six to eight hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean like 68 whenever I was telling</v>

3183
02:23:36.150 --> 02:23:38.940
<v Speaker 1>the guys at water four and it's just</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they don't know.</v>

3184
02:23:39.020 --> 02:23:42.280
<v Speaker 1>They've been incredibly supportive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But whenever I broke it down like winter</v>

3185
02:23:42.330 --> 02:23:43.980
<v Speaker 1>training schedule,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what time do you train a day?</v>

3186
02:23:44.520 --> 02:23:46.320
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they know some nfl guys and stuff like</v>

3187
02:23:46.321 --> 02:23:51.321
<v Speaker 1>that that might train once a day for</v>
<v Speaker 1>four or five times a week or maybe twice</v>

3188
02:23:52.830 --> 02:23:53.641
<v Speaker 1>a day with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they,</v>

3189
02:23:53.641 --> 02:23:54.780
<v Speaker 1>it's just so different that they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

3190
02:23:54.781 --> 02:23:56.700
<v Speaker 1>oh wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's why they've rallied around me</v>

3191
02:23:56.820 --> 02:24:00.570
<v Speaker 1>and I think that through that it's going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to free me up to really good all the</v>

3192
02:24:00.571 --> 02:24:02.730
<v Speaker 1>right places.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get up to grudge for my strike and get</v>

3193

<v Speaker 1>wrestling.</v>

3194

<v Speaker 1>can.</v>
