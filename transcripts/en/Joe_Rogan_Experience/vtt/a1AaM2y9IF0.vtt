<v Speaker 1>It was the best.</v>

7
00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:09.323
<v Speaker 1>It was.</v>

8
00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:13.320
<v Speaker 1>It was like they only took 20 kids a year into the course.</v>

9
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.660
<v Speaker 1>3000 people auditioned.</v>

10
00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:16.260
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

11
00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:16.500
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

12
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:17.940
<v Speaker 1>It was like a very prestigious thing.</v>

13
00:00:17.941 --> 00:00:22.710
<v Speaker 1>It was the same course of Hugh Jackman did and there was an acting paper.</v>

14
00:00:22.711 --> 00:00:24.990
<v Speaker 1>I could not good enough so I can sing a bit.</v>

15
00:00:24.991 --> 00:00:28.620
<v Speaker 1>So I got in the musical theater thing and I could back in the day.</v>

16
00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:28.981
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

17
00:00:28.981 --> 00:00:29.700
<v Speaker 1>You sing now.</v>

18
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.970
<v Speaker 1>No soundtrack to legit.</v>

19
00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:33.660
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you.</v>

20
00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.100
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you something about me.</v>

21
00:00:35.101 --> 00:00:36.010
<v Speaker 1>You might not know.</v>

22
00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:37.650
<v Speaker 1>That's a little fact about me.</v>

23
00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:38.610
<v Speaker 1>I Sang,</v>

24
00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.350
<v Speaker 1>I sang twice in the Australian opera,</v>

25
00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.930
<v Speaker 1>in the course as an employed opera singer.</v>

26
00:00:42.931 --> 00:00:43.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

27
00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.800
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

28
00:00:44.801 --> 00:00:45.180
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

29
00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.950
<v Speaker 1>what kind of like what it became was a little,</v>

30
00:00:46.951 --> 00:00:47.640
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

31
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:48.150
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

32
00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:48.510
<v Speaker 1>I've had,</v>

33
00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:49.470
<v Speaker 1>I've had vocal nodules.</v>

34
00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:50.550
<v Speaker 1>I've had surgery on my voice.</v>

35
00:00:50.551 --> 00:00:52.110
<v Speaker 1>I can't over,</v>

36
00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:53.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm not making it up though.</v>

37
00:00:53.341 --> 00:00:54.000
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

38
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.140
<v Speaker 1>I sang in a,</v>

39
00:00:55.141 --> 00:00:58.830
<v Speaker 1>Charles Green was Romeo and Juliet and Wagner as the flying Dutchman as course</v>

40
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.180
<v Speaker 1>vocal nodules.</v>

41
00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:01.183
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

42
00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.270
<v Speaker 1>pull ups on your vocal chords.</v>

43
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.420
<v Speaker 1>Basically calluses from smoking coke.</v>

44
00:01:06.421 --> 00:01:10.200
<v Speaker 1>A yelling is mostly from yelling from the bashing together and they get</v>

45
00:01:10.201 --> 00:01:10.711
<v Speaker 1>calluses.</v>

46
00:01:10.711 --> 00:01:13.830
<v Speaker 1>So you can actually get your vocal cords close enough together to make high</v>

47
00:01:13.831 --> 00:01:16.170
<v Speaker 1>sounds because there's always a gap in him from these little things.</v>

48
00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:17.070
<v Speaker 1>So it makes you a man.</v>

49
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:17.933
<v Speaker 1>It's like a noodles.</v>

50
00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:18.991
<v Speaker 1>He'll fucking man.</v>

51
00:01:18.991 --> 00:01:19.824
<v Speaker 1>It's what it is.</v>

52
00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.821
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

53
00:01:20.821 --> 00:01:22.340
<v Speaker 1>Well I guess of course</v>

54
00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.310
<v Speaker 1>John Wayne's voice came from exactly.</v>

55
00:01:26.311 --> 00:01:27.140
<v Speaker 1>It's like these,</v>

56
00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.630
<v Speaker 1>these grisled comedians who have yelled on stage or times cause there that is</v>

57
00:01:30.631 --> 00:01:31.464
<v Speaker 1>covered like the,</v>

58
00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:31.891
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

59
00:01:31.891 --> 00:01:32.724
<v Speaker 1>what else is bad?</v>

60
00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.390
<v Speaker 1>Like these white Bobby Slayton popped up.</v>

61
00:01:36.391 --> 00:01:36.991
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you,</v>

62
00:01:36.991 --> 00:01:37.481
<v Speaker 1>that guy,</v>

63
00:01:37.481 --> 00:01:38.850
<v Speaker 1>his vocal cords is just,</v>

64
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.670
<v Speaker 1>just a nodule or nodular.</v>

65
00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:42.180
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you,</v>

66
00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.730
<v Speaker 1>he might've had a vocal surgery if I'm,</v>

67
00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:45.803
<v Speaker 1>I might be wrong,</v>

68
00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:46.671
<v Speaker 1>but I've,</v>

69
00:01:46.671 --> 00:01:48.600
<v Speaker 1>I've heard of comedians that have had that before.</v>

70
00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:50.460
<v Speaker 1>It's more than why I had this before.</v>

71
00:01:50.461 --> 00:01:53.890
<v Speaker 1>I was a comedian to try to save the Singing Korea.</v>

72
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.680
<v Speaker 1>So he had surgery on the pollups.</v>

73
00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:55.931
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

74
00:01:55.931 --> 00:01:56.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

75
00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.810
<v Speaker 1>So they shaved down the cows,</v>

76
00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:58.201
<v Speaker 1>couldn't,</v>

77
00:01:58.201 --> 00:01:59.610
<v Speaker 1>couldn't talk for a,</v>

78
00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:00.720
<v Speaker 1>couldn't talk for two months.</v>

79
00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:01.680
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>

80
00:02:01.681 --> 00:02:02.250
<v Speaker 1>two months.</v>

81
00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:02.521
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

82
00:02:02.521 --> 00:02:04.020
<v Speaker 1>just riding on a fucking pad.</v>

83
00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.831
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

84
00:02:04.831 --> 00:02:06.840
<v Speaker 1>that was what that was when I thought,</v>

85
00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:07.741
<v Speaker 1>this job,</v>

86
00:02:07.741 --> 00:02:09.840
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to get these back because I partied too much.</v>

87
00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:11.281
<v Speaker 1>And then I thought,</v>

88
00:02:11.281 --> 00:02:12.690
<v Speaker 1>I've got no other skills.</v>

89
00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.790
<v Speaker 1>I've got no other skills in the fucking world.</v>

90
00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.240
<v Speaker 1>And I decided I always wanted to be a comedian,</v>

91
00:02:18.241 --> 00:02:20.400
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't a job that my parents would never let me do,</v>

92
00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.050
<v Speaker 1>or it wouldn't let you do that.</v>

93
00:02:22.051 --> 00:02:22.701
<v Speaker 1>He said it wasn't,</v>

94
00:02:22.701 --> 00:02:25.560
<v Speaker 1>my parents were happy with the musical theater because they saw what my mother</v>

95
00:02:25.561 --> 00:02:26.700
<v Speaker 1>could brag and act like.</v>

96
00:02:26.701 --> 00:02:27.491
<v Speaker 1>It was a bit more light.</v>

97
00:02:27.491 --> 00:02:28.590
<v Speaker 1>He die then the whole thing.</v>

98
00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.590
<v Speaker 1>But I decided I was going to be a comedian in that two months where I couldn't</v>

99
00:02:31.591 --> 00:02:32.424
<v Speaker 1>talk.</v>

100
00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.300
<v Speaker 1>I was like a secret that I had to myself.</v>

101
00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.541
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

102
00:02:36.541 --> 00:02:37.800
<v Speaker 1>that's fucking awesome.</v>

103
00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:38.820
<v Speaker 1>And I had already,</v>

104
00:02:38.821 --> 00:02:39.070
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

105

149
00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:00.610
<v Speaker 1>She could.</v>

150
00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:01.030
<v Speaker 1>She was,</v>

151
00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:02.950
<v Speaker 1>she had everything is go right.</v>

152
00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:08.820
<v Speaker 1>And then they brought out the first version of like pop auto or American auto or</v>

153
00:04:09.611 --> 00:04:13.390
<v Speaker 1>whatever that it was done in Australia first and was called a miking.</v>

154
00:04:13.391 --> 00:04:17.470
<v Speaker 1>The band or whatever real they show it was actually originated in New Zealand,</v>

155
00:04:17.471 --> 00:04:19.090
<v Speaker 1>but then in Australia they might just go bang,</v>

156
00:04:19.091 --> 00:04:23.270
<v Speaker 1>called Bardo were all the people came in and auditioned to be in his goal band.</v>

157
00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:24.790
<v Speaker 1>And the goal that I was at university,</v>

158
00:04:24.791 --> 00:04:28.120
<v Speaker 1>she went to this audition for this TV show she got in the band,</v>

159
00:04:28.121 --> 00:04:30.610
<v Speaker 1>but they played it over weeks and weeks and weeks and they had cameras in the</v>

160
00:04:30.611 --> 00:04:30.741
<v Speaker 1>house.</v>

161
00:04:30.741 --> 00:04:32.470
<v Speaker 1>And it was the first reality,</v>

162
00:04:32.471 --> 00:04:37.240
<v Speaker 1>big reality show ever where we were watching these people just living in a house</v>

163
00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:41.260
<v Speaker 1>and people couldn't fathom whether there's no act as this is real.</v>

164
00:04:41.261 --> 00:04:42.100
<v Speaker 1>It was like a very,</v>

165
00:04:42.101 --> 00:04:42.291
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

166
00:04:42.291 --> 00:04:42.930
<v Speaker 1>she's there.</v>

167
00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:43.763
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

168
00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:44.711
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

169
00:04:44.711 --> 00:04:45.161
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

170
00:04:45.161 --> 00:04:45.790
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

171
00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:49.570
<v Speaker 1>I used to stand behind her stretching and dance class every and just fucking,</v>

172
00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:52.120
<v Speaker 1>just all I wanted was to have sex with this young lady.</v>

173
00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:53.463
<v Speaker 1>Never happened.</v>

174
00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:54.423
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

175
00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:55.341

176
00:04:55.341 --> 00:05:00.070
<v Speaker 1>so she gets in his band and she stills the story guy.</v>

177

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:09.700
<v Speaker 1>So she's got this big opportunity.</v>

180
00:05:09.701 --> 00:05:13.300
<v Speaker 1>Everyone else who was in this band has gone on to big things like Sophie monk is</v>

<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

215
00:06:15.571 --> 00:06:16.301
<v Speaker 1>when I went away,</v>

216
00:06:16.301 --> 00:06:17.630
<v Speaker 1>went to university together.</v>

217
00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:19.011
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

218
00:06:19.011 --> 00:06:19.551
<v Speaker 1>And then she went,</v>

219
00:06:19.551 --> 00:06:20.570
<v Speaker 1>oh did we find,</v>

220
00:06:20.571 --> 00:06:21.010
<v Speaker 1>and then I went,</v>

221
00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:21.290
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

222
00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:22.280
<v Speaker 1>give her the pot.</v>

223
00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:23.511
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

224
00:06:23.511 --> 00:06:25.100
<v Speaker 1>Because I'm a good guy.</v>

225
00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:29.360
<v Speaker 1>The pot had like one line and then she came on set.</v>

226
00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:31.580
<v Speaker 1>And I think in that moment,</v>

227
00:06:31.581 --> 00:06:33.020
<v Speaker 1>this is how much of an ocelot must be.</v>

228
00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:34.900
<v Speaker 1>She remembered who I was from school</v>

229
00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:37.161
<v Speaker 1>when she came on,</v>

230
00:06:37.161 --> 00:06:38.240
<v Speaker 1>since he came on set,</v>

231
00:06:38.241 --> 00:06:38.751
<v Speaker 1>she was like,</v>

232
00:06:38.751 --> 00:06:39.870
<v Speaker 1>cause Jim Jeffrey,</v>

233
00:06:39.871 --> 00:06:41.540
<v Speaker 1>I have my real last name is Nugent.</v>

234
00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:43.970
<v Speaker 1>I use my middle name as a stage name because of Ted.</v>

235
00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:44.871
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

236
00:06:44.871 --> 00:06:45.681
<v Speaker 1>I just did.</v>

237
00:06:45.681 --> 00:06:47.690
<v Speaker 1>Jim Jefferies sounded better than Jim Nugent.</v>

238
00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:48.710
<v Speaker 1>Jim Jeffrey,</v>

239
00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:49.281
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

240
00:06:49.281 --> 00:06:50.114
<v Speaker 1>It was just,</v>

241
00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:52.670
<v Speaker 1>it was a little tiny thing to with alliteration,</v>

242
00:06:52.671 --> 00:06:53.230
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

243
00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:53.620
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

244
00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:54.330
<v Speaker 1>And so she'll,</v>

245
00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:55.130
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>

246
00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:56.740
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't going by my original name,</v>

247
00:06:56.741 --> 00:06:57.640
<v Speaker 1>so she had no reasons.</v>

248
00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:58.100
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

249
00:06:58.100 --> 00:06:59.270
<v Speaker 1>And then I sort of reminded,</v>

250
00:06:59.290 --> 00:06:59.541
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

251
00:06:59.541 --> 00:07:02.340
<v Speaker 1>how he used to come over and your mommy's to make this type of food and blah</v>

252
00:07:02.341 --> 00:07:02.611

253
00:07:02.611 --> 00:07:02.751
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

254
00:07:02.751 --> 00:07:02.901
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

255
00:07:02.901 --> 00:07:02.991
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

256
00:07:02.991 --> 00:07:03.824
<v Speaker 1>blah.</v>

257
00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:08.390
<v Speaker 1>I think she was so pissed off that I made it and she didn't.</v>

258
00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:11.380
<v Speaker 1>And I had my own TV show that uh,</v>

259
00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:12.980
<v Speaker 1>she went up to the producer and went,</v>

260
00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:13.401
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

261
00:07:13.401 --> 00:07:14.300
<v Speaker 1>I've got food poisoning.</v>

262
00:07:14.301 --> 00:07:16.010
<v Speaker 1>I need to go home and just walked off the set.</v>

263
00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:18.620
<v Speaker 1>What didn't even do the job?</v>

264
00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:20.450
<v Speaker 1>Maybe she's just kinda little squirt.</v>

265
00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:21.313
<v Speaker 1>Maybe she had to leave.</v>

266
00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:22.190
<v Speaker 1>Wait,</v>

267
00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:22.341

00:07:22.641 --> 00:07:23.474

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:25.970
<v Speaker 1>didn't take the Gig man.</v>

272
00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:28.010
<v Speaker 1>What makes you think that it's because of that?</v>

273
00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:29.720
<v Speaker 1>I just think it's,</v>

274
00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:32.990
<v Speaker 1>I just think people get fucking jealous,</v>

275
00:07:32.991 --> 00:07:33.210

276
00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:34.130
<v Speaker 1>We all get jealous.</v>

277
00:07:34.131 --> 00:07:35.270

280
00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:44.090
<v Speaker 1>All the other gay guys had abs and stuff and I was like a bit of a doorway</v>

281
00:07:44.091 --> 00:07:46.520
<v Speaker 1>fucking marshmallow looking kind of who could sing a little bit,</v>

282
00:07:46.521 --> 00:07:49.520
<v Speaker 1>who couldn't dance at all and was acting was pretty average.</v>

283
00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:52.460
<v Speaker 1>I always kicked out like five people a year from the course,</v>

284
00:07:52.461 --> 00:07:52.671
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

285
00:07:52.671 --> 00:07:53.504

291
00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:05.990
<v Speaker 1>That competitive thing of show business is one of the weirdest aspects of it.</v>

292
00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:07.133
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

293
00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:08.660
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes even in relationships.</v>

294
00:08:08.661 --> 00:08:12.350
<v Speaker 1>I had a friend who got something and his girlfriend started crying when he got</v>

295
00:08:12.351 --> 00:08:15.830
<v Speaker 1>some part in some TV show and his girlfriend started crying because she was</v>

296
00:08:15.831 --> 00:08:15.950
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

297
00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:16.300
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

298
00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:18.080
<v Speaker 1>something's going to happen for me.</v>

299
00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:21.560
<v Speaker 1>Like that was her immediate reaction and I remember thinking,</v>

300
00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:22.430
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

301
00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:23.390
<v Speaker 1>I got to get rid of that,</v>

302
00:08:23.391 --> 00:08:25.490
<v Speaker 1>but here's something that's about to happen to you.</v>

303
00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:26.393
<v Speaker 1>I'm was,</v>

304
00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:29.863
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

305
00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:30.800
<v Speaker 1>that that,</v>

306
00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:32.480
<v Speaker 1>that's a very unattractive,</v>

307
00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:33.650
<v Speaker 1>that competitive things.</v>

308
00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:35.510
<v Speaker 1>He can't help it a little bit.</v>

309
00:08:35.511 --> 00:08:36.350
<v Speaker 1>With comedy.</v>

310
00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:39.700
<v Speaker 1>It's very hard to never have it with any other stope comic.</v>

311
00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:41.600
<v Speaker 1>There's always going to be one where you go that guy.</v>

312
00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:42.661
<v Speaker 1>But I,</v>

313
00:08:42.661 --> 00:08:47.510
<v Speaker 1>I I found out now and I think it's easier because I got a bit of success,</v>

314
00:08:47.511 --> 00:08:49.580
<v Speaker 1>but I don't give a shit what any,</v>

315
00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:50.840
<v Speaker 1>I just worry about me.</v>

316
00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:53.650
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a fuck if someone's got a movie or something.</v>

317
00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:54.441
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a fuck.</v>

318
00:08:54.441 --> 00:08:55.560
<v Speaker 1>I just worry about me.</v>

319
00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:56.551
<v Speaker 1>And then you know,</v>

320
00:08:56.551 --> 00:08:57.241
<v Speaker 1>the good guys,</v>

321
00:08:57.241 --> 00:08:59.280
<v Speaker 1>you know the bad guys and that's it.</v>

322
00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:01.680
<v Speaker 1>But when in the early days it was more,</v>

323
00:09:01.681 --> 00:09:04.770
<v Speaker 1>I got more jealous at has that going at that club.</v>

324
00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:06.600
<v Speaker 1>I've been trying to get into that club forever.</v>

325
00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:09.090
<v Speaker 1>That's just the frustration of not having made it yet.</v>

326
00:09:09.091 --> 00:09:11.100
<v Speaker 1>And then once you have and you've got some success,</v>

327
00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:13.870
<v Speaker 1>it goes away and then you can actually enjoy it for what it is.</v>

328
00:09:13.930 --> 00:09:17.000
<v Speaker 1>I think the successful people who are still fucking don't want anything other,</v>

329
00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:21.780
<v Speaker 1>well there's a lot of successful people also that only work with terrible</v>

336
00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:36.810

337
00:09:36.811 --> 00:09:38.250
<v Speaker 1>They don't want anybody to shine.</v>
