<v Speaker 2>seven years ago or something like that.</v>

84
00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.240
<v Speaker 2>And it was the most creepiest shit ever.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I need you to work to double shifts here and there.</v>

92
00:02:23.081 --> 00:02:23.890
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

93
00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.210
<v Speaker 2>I think I've got my girlfriend pregnant.</v>

94
00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.790
<v Speaker 2>We're going to go over and do the bowling alley later and I'm just like,</v>

95
00:02:27.791 --> 00:02:28.624
<v Speaker 2>what</v>

96
00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.230
<v Speaker 2>you used to talk to when you were in Ohio?</v>

97
00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:32.471
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

98
00:02:32.471 --> 00:02:34.270
<v Speaker 2>Like people from Ohio and stuff like that.</v>

99
00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:35.890
<v Speaker 2>It was so fucking weird.</v>

100
00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:37.960
<v Speaker 1>Do you look back on people from Ohio?</v>

101
00:02:37.961 --> 00:02:42.961
<v Speaker 1>Like they don't know that Ohio is like escape</v>

102
00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.741
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

103
00:02:43.741 --> 00:02:45.390
<v Speaker 2>I think people don't know how I would just feel trapped.</v>

104
00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.661
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

105
00:02:45.661 --> 00:02:48.150
<v Speaker 2>it's more like they don't trap they I think,</v>

106
00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:49.230
<v Speaker 2>I don't think,</v>

107
00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:49.501
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

108

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

110
00:02:51.121 --> 00:02:54.420
<v Speaker 2>because you don't make a lot of money when you live in Ohio for the majority of</v>

111
00:02:54.421 --> 00:02:54.811
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

112
00:02:54.811 --> 00:02:55.644
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 5>That's pretty savage.</v>

150
00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:40.783
<v Speaker 5>I love that.</v>

151
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.080
<v Speaker 5>I love that idea.</v>

152
00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:43.250
<v Speaker 5>That's awesome.</v>

153
00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:44.630
<v Speaker 5>That must've been a hell of an experience.</v>

154
00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:45.540
<v Speaker 4>It was fun.</v>

155
00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:46.260
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

156
00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:47.093
<v Speaker 4>You learn a lot.</v>

157
00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:48.750
<v Speaker 4>You learned that things usually work out.</v>

158
00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:49.950
<v Speaker 4>What was the motivation for that?</v>

159
00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:51.060
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

160
00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:51.611
<v Speaker 4>I actually,</v>

161
00:03:51.611 --> 00:03:51.781
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

162
00:03:51.781 --> 00:03:54.810
<v Speaker 4>I did talk about this on Marin's podcasts recently.</v>

163
00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:56.510
<v Speaker 4>Just play Marin's podcasts.</v>

164
00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.460
<v Speaker 4>We'll go back and take it was,</v>

165
00:03:59.461 --> 00:03:59.791
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

166
00:03:59.791 --> 00:04:02.580
<v Speaker 4>the short story is I was a,</v>

167
00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.630
<v Speaker 4>somebody I knew drowned and I knew and I had to identify their body.</v>

168
00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:07.110
<v Speaker 4>Whoa.</v>

169
00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.943
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

170
00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:09.660
<v Speaker 4>and it just kind of like,</v>

171
00:04:09.661 --> 00:04:13.140
<v Speaker 4>I was like 23 and she was pretty young.</v>

172
00:04:13.141 --> 00:04:15.180
<v Speaker 4>She was like 22 or 23 and I was like,</v>

173
00:04:15.181 --> 00:04:19.740
<v Speaker 4>and she was going taking classes in the summer to graduate college earlier.</v>

174
00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:21.000
<v Speaker 4>And I just thought like,</v>

175
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.181
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

176
00:04:21.181 --> 00:04:22.290
<v Speaker 4>she's taking classes,</v>

177
00:04:22.291 --> 00:04:23.160
<v Speaker 4>like doing all this shit.</v>

178
00:04:23.161 --> 00:04:24.270
<v Speaker 4>She didn't want to do,</v>

179
00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:25.291
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

180
00:04:25.291 --> 00:04:26.130
<v Speaker 4>I just was like,</v>

181
00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:26.851
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

182
00:04:26.851 --> 00:04:28.140
<v Speaker 4>you can just do whatever you want.</v>

183
00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:29.003
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

184
00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.110
<v Speaker 4>and life's short I guess,</v>

185
00:04:31.111 --> 00:04:31.944
<v Speaker 4>or I don't know.</v>

186
00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:33.133
<v Speaker 4>But I just,</v>

187
00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:36.710
<v Speaker 4>that was kind of the motivation for fucked.</v>

188
00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:38.160
<v Speaker 4>And I saw a cheap ticket yeah.</v>

189
00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:39.110
<v Speaker 5>To,</v>

190
00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.943
<v Speaker 5>to Ireland.</v>

191
00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:41.780
<v Speaker 5>I think you might've told him the story before,</v>

192
00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:45.140
<v Speaker 5>but it's a fascinating nonetheless.</v>

193
00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:48.530
<v Speaker 5>But we very rarely get to see dead bodies.</v>

194
00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:49.221
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

195
00:04:49.221 --> 00:04:49.401
<v Speaker 5>we,</v>

196
00:04:49.401 --> 00:04:51.050
<v Speaker 5>it's so rare that you get to see one.</v>

197
00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:53.000
<v Speaker 5>I remember when I saw my grandfather,</v>

198
00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:56.000
<v Speaker 5>my grandfather died of cancer and when,</v>

199
00:04:56.001 --> 00:04:56.270
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

200
00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:57.700
<v Speaker 5>when I went to the morgue,</v>

201
00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:57.890
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

202
00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:59.510
<v Speaker 5>when they have all dressed up and shit.</v>

203
00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:00.290
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

204
00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:00.591
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

205
00:05:00.591 --> 00:05:01.880
<v Speaker 5>And you still standing near the body.</v>

206
00:05:01.881 --> 00:05:02.980
<v Speaker 5>I was like in the Cask,</v>

207
00:05:02.981 --> 00:05:03.591
<v Speaker 5>I realized,</v>

208
00:05:03.591 --> 00:05:03.951
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

209
00:05:03.951 --> 00:05:06.440
<v Speaker 5>this is the first dead body I've ever been around.</v>

210
00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:08.930
<v Speaker 5>I've never really been around a dead body.</v>

211
00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:10.490
<v Speaker 5>It's amazing that all these people die,</v>

212
00:05:10.491 --> 00:05:13.010
<v Speaker 5>but we do such a good job of keeping bodies away from,</v>

213
00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:14.340
<v Speaker 5>from people's funerals.</v>

214
00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:14.870
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

215
00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:16.520
<v Speaker 5>Because it's so disturbing.</v>

216
00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:16.730
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

217
00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:17.421
<v Speaker 5>like viewing,</v>

218
00:05:17.421 --> 00:05:18.590
<v Speaker 5>so it doesn't,</v>

219
00:05:18.591 --> 00:05:21.530
<v Speaker 5>doesn't never kind of tweak you out when you think about a dude who be a</v>

220
00:05:21.531 --> 00:05:22.280
<v Speaker 5>mortician.</v>

221
00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:22.521
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

222
00:05:22.521 --> 00:05:24.460
<v Speaker 5>I understand that it's a very important job.</v>

223
00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:25.910
<v Speaker 5>I understand it's an important job.</v>

224
00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:26.601
<v Speaker 5>I do get it.</v>

225
00:05:26.601 --> 00:05:26.761
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

226
00:05:26.761 --> 00:05:27.290
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

227
00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:27.531
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

228
00:05:27.531 --> 00:05:29.060
<v Speaker 5>forensic medicine and the idea of,</v>

229
00:05:29.061 --> 00:05:29.660
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

230
00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:31.100
<v Speaker 5>solving crimes and,</v>

231
00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:31.760
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

232
00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:33.580
<v Speaker 5>checking people's corpses and shit like that.</v>

233
00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:35.810
<v Speaker 5>Dr. Michael and I love that it's,</v>

234
00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:37.490
<v Speaker 5>that's an amazing show that HBO show,</v>

235
00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:41.600
<v Speaker 5>but doesn't it fucking freak you out that they're handling dead bodies?</v>

236
00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:44.590
<v Speaker 5>There's something about that man that tweaks my hand.</v>

237
00:05:44.591 --> 00:05:45.260
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

238
00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.450
<v Speaker 5>just touch and dead bodies.</v>

239
00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:49.760
<v Speaker 5>The IMD a just the possibility,</v>

240
00:05:49.761 --> 00:05:53.660
<v Speaker 5>and I know this is not the case with these doctors and I know it's most likely</v>

241
00:05:53.661 --> 00:05:56.720
<v Speaker 5>not the case with 99.9% of the morticians,</v>

242
00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:57.860
<v Speaker 5>but the fact that</v>

243
00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:02.980
<v Speaker 1>there's like the 1% that it would enjoy fucking moving them around and smacking</v>

244
00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.550
<v Speaker 1>him and putting on little shows from south that,</v>

245
00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:07.413
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

246
00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:08.780
<v Speaker 1>Sam Kennison bit.</v>

247
00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:12.800
<v Speaker 1>I fucking made me pee my pants at first time I heard it.</v>

248
00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:17.980
<v Speaker 1>That kid bit got me when he lays him about doing standup comedy that bit,</v>

249
00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:20.300
<v Speaker 1>and it wasn't even told by Sam Kennison.</v>

250
00:06:20.301 --> 00:06:22.100
<v Speaker 1>It was told by a girl that I worked with,</v>

251
00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:22.641
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

252
00:06:22.641 --> 00:06:26.360
<v Speaker 1>I was working at this health club and this girl came in and she was just fucking</v>

253
00:06:26.361 --> 00:06:26.871
<v Speaker 1>laughing.</v>

254
00:06:26.871 --> 00:06:27.261
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>

255
00:06:27.261 --> 00:06:28.094
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

256
00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:29.450
<v Speaker 1>if that it heavy Boston accent.</v>

257
00:06:29.451 --> 00:06:31.370
<v Speaker 1>I saw a fucking this guy on TV,</v>

258
00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:33.230
<v Speaker 1>Sam Kinison all my God,</v>

259
00:06:33.231 --> 00:06:34.430
<v Speaker 1>he was so fucking funny.</v>

260
00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:35.061
<v Speaker 1>Sue.</v>

261
00:06:35.061 --> 00:06:37.310
<v Speaker 1>She goes and she did on the floor.</v>

262
00:06:37.311 --> 00:06:38.330
<v Speaker 1>She got down on the stomach.</v>

263
00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:40.640
<v Speaker 1>He didn't live,</v>

264
00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:41.473
<v Speaker 1>keeps fucking,</v>

265
00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:46.130
<v Speaker 1>she did it and she did a pretty good job of it because I was laughing so hard.</v>

266
00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:46.641
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

267
00:06:46.641 --> 00:06:47.151
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>

268
00:06:47.151 --> 00:06:48.110
<v Speaker 1>He said what?</v>

269
00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:50.270
<v Speaker 1>Like that's the craziest thing I've ever heard of.</v>

270
00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:54.170
<v Speaker 1>And then I got ahold of the VHS tape and I remember watching that bid going,</v>

271
00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:57.110
<v Speaker 1>God damn like that's comedy too.</v>

272
00:06:57.530 --> 00:06:58.430
<v Speaker 1>That's comedy too.</v>

273
00:06:58.431 --> 00:07:00.500
<v Speaker 1>I thought comedy was that evening at the Improv stuff.</v>

274
00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:02.780
<v Speaker 1>I thought comedy for white guys was,</v>

275
00:07:02.781 --> 00:07:05.420
<v Speaker 1>you roll up your sleeves and you'd talked about pet food.</v>

276
00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:06.680
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

277
00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:08.930
<v Speaker 1>That's really what you saw on TV a lot.</v>

278
00:07:08.931 --> 00:07:11.570
<v Speaker 1>And as a child I saw that.</v>

279
00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:12.231
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

280
00:07:12.231 --> 00:07:14.490
<v Speaker 1>occasionally you saw something on the tonight show like</v>

281
00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:17.390
<v Speaker 1>delirious.</v>

282
00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:17.710
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

283
00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:19.070
<v Speaker 1>I'm a little younger than you.</v>

284
00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:22.790
<v Speaker 1>When I was 14 I saw delirious and Andrew dice clay.</v>

285
00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:25.820
<v Speaker 1>That is special from the Tla.</v>

286
00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:26.691
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

287
00:07:26.691 --> 00:07:27.280
<v Speaker 1>that was,</v>

288
00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:27.620
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

289
00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:28.880
<v Speaker 1>delirious is another one.</v>

290
00:07:28.881 --> 00:07:33.110
<v Speaker 1>I didn't then raw or delirious might have been so good that I never even thought</v>

291
00:07:33.111 --> 00:07:34.700
<v Speaker 1>I could possibly do stand up at that time.</v>

292
00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:36.380
<v Speaker 1>Really ridiculous.</v>

293
00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:37.071
<v Speaker 1>I think it was,</v>

294
00:07:37.071 --> 00:07:39.530
<v Speaker 1>I was getting older when Kennison came around,</v>

295
00:07:39.531 --> 00:07:41.100
<v Speaker 1>I was more confident to keep,</v>

296
00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:44.240
<v Speaker 1>I think delirious was when I was younger and I remember watching them,</v>

297
00:07:44.241 --> 00:07:45.170
<v Speaker 1>my friend Jimmy lawless,</v>

300
00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:51.500
<v Speaker 1>it was so funny.</v>

301
00:07:51.501 --> 00:07:51.631
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

302
00:07:51.631 --> 00:07:54.410

303
00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:56.510
<v Speaker 1>We're all sitting around and we're watching it.</v>

304
00:07:56.511 --> 00:08:00.050
<v Speaker 1>And it was so fucking funny that we were like embarrassed to be sitting next to</v>

305
00:08:00.051 --> 00:08:00.670
<v Speaker 1>each other.</v>

306
00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:00.900
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

307
00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:02.990
<v Speaker 1>It was so good for the time,</v>

308
00:08:02.991 --> 00:08:03.220

311
00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:07.830
<v Speaker 1>or delirious rather.</v>

312
00:08:07.831 --> 00:08:09.560
<v Speaker 1>It was just really good.</v>

313
00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:12.020

315
00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:13.641
<v Speaker 1>I did,</v>

316
00:08:13.641 --> 00:08:14.690
<v Speaker 1>cause I wasn't super,</v>

317
00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:17.930
<v Speaker 1>I saw it a couple times when I was a kid and,</v>

<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

321
00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:23.300
<v Speaker 1>and it,</v>

00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:24.230
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty good.</v>

323
00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:25.551
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

324
00:08:25.551 --> 00:08:26.130
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

325
00:08:26.130 --> 00:08:28.080

343
00:08:48.831 --> 00:08:50.180
<v Speaker 1>It's something weird about that,</v>

344
00:08:50.181 --> 00:08:50.600
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

345
00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:53.120
<v Speaker 1>Black comics can go way more sexy.</v>

346
00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:54.710
<v Speaker 1>They can go way harder.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

348

00:08:56.770 --> 00:08:57.170
<v Speaker 4>that's true.</v>

350
00:08:57.170 --> 00:08:58.710
<v Speaker 4>It's funny when my friend died.</v>

00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:00.000
<v Speaker 4>Do you know Chelsea Peretti?</v>

356
00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:11.160

358
00:09:12.601 --> 00:09:14.130
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if she really was going to do it.</v>

359
00:09:14.131 --> 00:09:19.131
<v Speaker 4>But did you watch the roast of Charlie Sheen when Mike Tyson,</v>

<v Speaker 5>She attacked Mike Tyson.</v>

380
00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:46.300
<v Speaker 5>It was one of the most bold and vicious insult attacks I've ever seen.</v>

381
00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:49.400
<v Speaker 5>And Tyson tried to come back,</v>

00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:50.820
<v Speaker 5>like tried to go after.</v>

383

<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

385
00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:57.020
<v Speaker 5>I think if there was as many digs out you that within you,</v>

386
00:09:57.021 --> 00:09:58.400
<v Speaker 5>you will look like a porcupine.</v>

387
00:09:58.720 --> 00:09:59.460
<v Speaker 4>Something like that.</v>

388
00:09:59.460 --> 00:09:59.611
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

389
00:09:59.611 --> 00:10:00.351

390
00:10:00.351 --> 00:10:00.901
<v Speaker 4>is that what he said?</v>

391
00:10:00.901 --> 00:10:01.590
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

392
00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:02.670
<v Speaker 4>And she just goes,</v>

393
00:10:03.210 --> 00:10:05.210
<v Speaker 4>does anyone have a translator for that?</v>

394
00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:05.641
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

395
00:10:05.641 --> 00:10:06.474
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

396
00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:07.201
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

397
00:10:07.201 --> 00:10:07.980
<v Speaker 4>She was really fun.</v>

398
00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:08.813
<v Speaker 4>God,</v>

399
00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:10.501
<v Speaker 4>I thought it was good though.</v>

400
00:10:10.501 --> 00:10:11.220
<v Speaker 4>The whole show.</v>

401
00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:11.710
<v Speaker 4>I didn't it,</v>

402
00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:12.550
<v Speaker 5>I didn't watch it,</v>

403
00:10:12.610 --> 00:10:13.720
<v Speaker 5>but I heard her shit.</v>

404
00:10:13.721 --> 00:10:15.070
<v Speaker 5>They were planning on Opie and Anthony.</v>

405
00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:20.100
<v Speaker 5>I was fucking howling when she said about Bruce Willis and I'm Charlie Sheen</v>

406
00:10:20.741 --> 00:10:24.070
<v Speaker 5>being really similar because they were both big in the eighties and now they're</v>

407
00:10:24.071 --> 00:10:26.710
<v Speaker 5>having their old slots filled by Ashton Kutcher</v>

408
00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:28.731
<v Speaker 4>far less good.</v>

409
00:10:28.731 --> 00:10:30.510
<v Speaker 4>That's fucking hilarious.</v>

410
00:10:30.610 --> 00:10:31.010
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

411
00:10:31.010 --> 00:10:32.720
<v Speaker 4>that's a great joke.</v>

412
00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:34.950
<v Speaker 4>It's a really well worded too.</v>

413
00:10:35.570 --> 00:10:36.950
<v Speaker 4>She's hilarious.</v>

414
00:10:37.010 --> 00:10:37.701
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God,</v>

415
00:10:37.701 --> 00:10:38.534
<v Speaker 4>that girl's funny.</v>

416
00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:40.300
<v Speaker 4>Seth Macfarlane was an awesome,</v>

417
00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:41.450
<v Speaker 4>it was awesome on that too.</v>

418
00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:42.201
<v Speaker 4>I have to watch it.</v>

419
00:10:42.201 --> 00:10:42.841
<v Speaker 4>I'll have to watch it,</v>

420
00:10:42.841 --> 00:10:43.440
<v Speaker 4>but</v>

421
00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:43.861
<v Speaker 5>honestly,</v>

422
00:10:43.861 --> 00:10:46.200
<v Speaker 5>I don't enjoy roasts for the most part.</v>

423
00:10:46.530 --> 00:10:49.950
<v Speaker 5>I usually find them to be mean spirited and fucking weird.</v>

424
00:10:49.951 --> 00:10:50.161
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>

425
00:10:50.161 --> 00:10:51.330
<v Speaker 5>I've never wanted to do them.</v>

426
00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:55.170
<v Speaker 5>I didn't want to fucking shit on someone that hard right in front of them.</v>

427
00:10:55.171 --> 00:10:55.610
<v Speaker 5>I just,</v>

428
00:10:55.610 --> 00:10:56.490
<v Speaker 5>it's like I don't,</v>

429
00:10:57.030 --> 00:10:58.410
<v Speaker 5>it's cute and everything.</v>

430
00:10:58.411 --> 00:10:58.591
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

431
00:10:58.591 --> 00:10:59.460
<v Speaker 5>it's fun to watch,</v>

432
00:10:59.461 --> 00:11:00.840
<v Speaker 5>but no thanks man.</v>

433
00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:04.180
<v Speaker 4>If everybody knows each other really well too,</v>

434
00:11:04.210 --> 00:11:04.900
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

435
00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:06.460
<v Speaker 4>like if you're all friends,</v>

436
00:11:06.490 --> 00:11:06.761
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

437
00:11:06.761 --> 00:11:08.080
<v Speaker 4>busting each other's balls,</v>

438
00:11:08.081 --> 00:11:09.670
<v Speaker 4>but sometimes it's not,</v>

439
00:11:09.671 --> 00:11:10.420
<v Speaker 4>don't matter the gender.</v>

440
00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:12.370
<v Speaker 4>Watch the ones where they went after Pam Anderson.</v>

441
00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:15.400
<v Speaker 4>I didn't,</v>

442
00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:17.520
<v Speaker 4>I don't think I saw the panel Anderson won,</v>

443
00:11:17.521 --> 00:11:19.590
<v Speaker 4>but I haven't seen the Joan Rivers one either.</v>

444
00:11:19.591 --> 00:11:20.540
<v Speaker 4>Ruthless,</v>

445
00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:22.340
<v Speaker 5>ruthless.</v>

446
00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:24.750
<v Speaker 5>It's ruthless shit like you sit and watch it.</v>

447
00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:26.210
<v Speaker 5>I don't remember any specific,</v>

448
00:11:26.211 --> 00:11:28.520
<v Speaker 5>I very possibly,</v>

449
00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:29.870
<v Speaker 5>I don't remember specifics,</v>

450
00:11:29.871 --> 00:11:31.870
<v Speaker 5>but I remember being like listening to it gone,</v>

451
00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:32.271
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

452
00:11:32.271 --> 00:11:33.830
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to hear this.</v>

453
00:11:33.831 --> 00:11:34.161
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

454
00:11:34.161 --> 00:11:34.771
<v Speaker 5>what are you doing?</v>

455
00:11:34.771 --> 00:11:37.970
<v Speaker 5>You are you voicing what the problem is.</v>

456
00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:38.863
<v Speaker 5>It's funny.</v>

457
00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:39.830
<v Speaker 5>That's the problem.</v>

458
00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:41.840
<v Speaker 5>The problem is it's good stuff.</v>

459
00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:42.741
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>

460
00:11:42.741 --> 00:11:43.101
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

461
00:11:43.101 --> 00:11:46.190
<v Speaker 5>you're insulting the fuck out of someone hurting their feelings for no reason.</v>

462
00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:50.540
<v Speaker 5>But to me it's kind of hilarious and it's unfortunate that it is,</v>

463
00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:51.140
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

464
00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:54.250
<v Speaker 5>But when you're hearing her tee off on Mike Tyson was talking about Mike Tyson</v>

465
00:11:54.251 --> 00:11:54.491
<v Speaker 5>having,</v>

466
00:11:54.491 --> 00:11:54.840
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

467
00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:55.650
<v Speaker 5>a slut,</v>

468
00:11:55.650 --> 00:11:57.220
<v Speaker 5>a tattoo on his face.</v>

469
00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:01.510
<v Speaker 5>You know that my Ben don't know whether to punch him or to finish on him.</v>

470
00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:02.331
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

471
00:12:02.331 --> 00:12:02.691
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

472
00:12:02.691 --> 00:12:03.524
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

473
00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:03.900
<v Speaker 4>Really.</v>

474
00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:04.950
<v Speaker 4>I fucked it up.</v>

475
00:12:04.951 --> 00:12:05.551
<v Speaker 4>I think too.</v>

476
00:12:05.551 --> 00:12:06.384
<v Speaker 4>I fucked up.</v>

477
00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:07.830
<v Speaker 4>But it's great stuff.</v>

478
00:12:07.831 --> 00:12:08.940
<v Speaker 4>But it's so mean.</v>

479
00:12:08.941 --> 00:12:09.181
<v Speaker 4>You're like,</v>

480
00:12:09.181 --> 00:12:10.020
<v Speaker 4>whoa.</v>

481
00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:12.990
<v Speaker 4>Any Jessel nick had a couple really good ones.</v>

482
00:12:13.370 --> 00:12:15.540
<v Speaker 4>Good again towards Mike Tyson.</v>

483
00:12:15.541 --> 00:12:16.374
<v Speaker 4>He said,</v>

484
00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:17.610
<v Speaker 4>I'm paraphrasing,</v>

485
00:12:18.570 --> 00:12:20.310
<v Speaker 4>but the joke basically was,</v>

486
00:12:20.311 --> 00:12:21.144
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

487
00:12:21.690 --> 00:12:25.710
<v Speaker 4>best way to describe Mike Tyson is the same name of a Richard Pryor album,</v>

488
00:12:26.250 --> 00:12:30.930
<v Speaker 4>meaning not nigger's crazy was awkward and then nobody really got it.</v>

489
00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:31.381
<v Speaker 4>I got it.</v>

490
00:12:31.381 --> 00:12:33.990
<v Speaker 4>And it was and Patrice O'Neal or what guy?</v>

491
00:12:34.370 --> 00:12:35.070
<v Speaker 4>And Nick.</v>

492
00:12:35.070 --> 00:12:35.903
<v Speaker 4>He's a white guy.</v>

493
00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:36.960
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

494
00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:37.271
<v Speaker 4>but he,</v>

495
00:12:37.271 --> 00:12:38.850
<v Speaker 4>he didn't cut guy but he,</v>

496
00:12:38.851 --> 00:12:39.181
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

497
00:12:39.181 --> 00:12:41.040
<v Speaker 4>but he didn't say the name of the album.</v>

498
00:12:41.070 --> 00:12:41.910
<v Speaker 4>Oh no,</v>

499
00:12:41.911 --> 00:12:42.310
<v Speaker 4>he didn't.</v>

500
00:12:42.310 --> 00:12:42.750
<v Speaker 4>Oh.</v>

501
00:12:42.750 --> 00:12:43.200
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

502
00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:44.580
<v Speaker 4>I've said as in,</v>

503
00:12:44.581 --> 00:12:47.040
<v Speaker 4>and that was the joke that he was going to spell it out to everybody.</v>

504
00:12:47.070 --> 00:12:47.160
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

505
00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:47.971
<v Speaker 4>he didn't spell it out.</v>

506
00:12:47.971 --> 00:12:50.310
<v Speaker 4>He just left it at the same cause I was like,</v>

507
00:12:50.311 --> 00:12:51.090
<v Speaker 4>wow.</v>

508
00:12:51.090 --> 00:12:53.100
<v Speaker 4>No the same way or whatever.</v>

509
00:12:53.101 --> 00:12:53.311
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

510
00:12:53.311 --> 00:12:57.330
<v Speaker 4>he is the best way to describe him as the name of a Richard Pryor album and,</v>

511
00:12:57.331 --> 00:12:58.470
<v Speaker 4>and Patrice O'Neil.</v>

512
00:12:58.650 --> 00:13:01.110
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't go over very well on that tree.</v>

513
00:13:01.111 --> 00:13:01.560
<v Speaker 4>Says,</v>

514
00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:02.250
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

515
00:13:02.250 --> 00:13:02.551
<v Speaker 4>he goes,</v>

516
00:13:02.551 --> 00:13:02.720
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

517
00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:03.451

518
00:13:03.451 --> 00:13:04.284

00:13:05.821 --> 00:13:06.750
<v Speaker 4>They're not going to get that.</v>

522
00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:07.611
<v Speaker 4>And Jasmine,</v>

523

525
00:13:13.410 --> 00:13:13.770

00:13:20.641 --> 00:13:21.690
<v Speaker 4>I haven't seen a ton of them.</v>

533
00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:23.310
<v Speaker 4>I heard the Joan Rivers one is good.</v>

534
00:13:23.311 --> 00:13:25.650
<v Speaker 4>I heard when she comes back it's really funny.</v>

535
00:13:25.830 --> 00:13:26.550
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

540
00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:30.960
<v Speaker 4>That documentary.</v>

541
00:13:30.961 --> 00:13:31.681
<v Speaker 4>It was pretty good.</v>

542
00:13:31.681 --> 00:13:32.370
<v Speaker 4>Did you see that?</v>

543
00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:33.410
<v Speaker 4>I have not seen it,</v>

544
00:13:33.411 --> 00:13:35.310
<v Speaker 4>but a lot of people recommended it.</v>

545
00:13:35.311 --> 00:13:36.630
<v Speaker 4>What is it called again?</v>

546
00:13:37.830 --> 00:13:39.000
<v Speaker 4>The Joan Rivers documentary.</v>

549
00:13:41.090 --> 00:13:41.923
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

550
00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:42.510
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>

551
00:13:42.510 --> 00:13:43.650
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck is it called?</v>

552
00:13:43.780 --> 00:13:44.490
<v Speaker 4>Gooseneck.</v>

553
00:13:44.490 --> 00:13:45.323
<v Speaker 4>Is that what it is?</v>

554
00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:46.493
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

555
00:13:46.770 --> 00:13:48.030
<v Speaker 4>Do you think she writes all her jokes?</v>

556
00:13:48.031 --> 00:13:49.020
<v Speaker 4>Did he think she has like,</v>

557
00:13:49.050 --> 00:13:50.000
<v Speaker 4>she buys jokes.</v>

558
00:13:50.010 --> 00:13:50.821
<v Speaker 4>She doesn't people,</v>

559
00:13:50.821 --> 00:13:52.290
<v Speaker 4>but she probably rights.</v>

560
00:13:52.291 --> 00:13:54.240
<v Speaker 4>I mean she's pretty quick on the civil work.</v>

561
00:13:54.241 --> 00:13:54.970
<v Speaker 4>A piece of work.</v>

562
00:13:54.970 --> 00:13:55.830
<v Speaker 4>That's really good.</v>

563
00:13:56.070 --> 00:13:58.350
<v Speaker 4>I knew it was some kind of euphemism on facelifts.</v>

564
00:13:58.351 --> 00:13:59.184
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 5>I got to get into Louie.</v>

582
00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:20.510
<v Speaker 5>I cut way back on my TV watching.</v>

583
00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:24.500
<v Speaker 5>I cut way back to the point where I'm only watching like documentaries.</v>

00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:29.750
<v Speaker 5>occasionally I'll watch like a ancient aliens.</v>

00:14:31.091 --> 00:14:31.421
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

592
00:14:31.421 --> 00:14:32.620
<v Speaker 4>I love the idea of Vr.</v>

593
00:14:32.621 --> 00:14:36.250
<v Speaker 4>That breaking bad Louie breaking bad is awesome.</v>

594
00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:37.570
<v Speaker 4>Breaking bad's at best,</v>

595
00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:37.920
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

596
00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:39.390
<v Speaker 5>But Patton Oswald said it best.</v>

597
00:14:39.391 --> 00:14:39.691
<v Speaker 5>He said,</v>

598
00:14:39.691 --> 00:14:41.340
<v Speaker 5>I feel like it's homework.</v>

599
00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:43.170
<v Speaker 5>You know when you get into a show,</v>

600
00:14:43.171 --> 00:14:43.531
<v Speaker 5>it's like,</v>

601
00:14:43.531 --> 00:14:44.221
<v Speaker 5>it's homework.</v>

602
00:14:44.221 --> 00:14:46.420
<v Speaker 5>It's like you've got to keep up with these fucking DVR.</v>

603
00:14:46.421 --> 00:14:46.790
<v Speaker 5>Oh Man.</v>

604
00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:47.150
<v Speaker 4>That's it.</v>

605
00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:48.700
<v Speaker 4>That's what like it's a godsend.</v>

606
00:14:48.830 --> 00:14:50.440
<v Speaker 4>You just fucking watch it.</v>

607
00:14:50.810 --> 00:14:52.040
<v Speaker 4>About about like mad</v>

608
00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:52.251
<v Speaker 1>men.</v>

609
00:14:52.251 --> 00:14:53.860
<v Speaker 1>Everybody keeps telling me to mad men.</v>

610
00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:54.670
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>

611
00:14:54.670 --> 00:14:55.503
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

612
00:14:56.050 --> 00:14:56.520
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

613
00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:57.860
<v Speaker 1>we missed it so crazy.</v>

614
00:14:57.880 --> 00:14:58.410
<v Speaker 1>Unless,</v>

615
00:14:58.410 --> 00:15:00.020
<v Speaker 1>unless we get a wicked flu,</v>

616
00:15:00.170 --> 00:15:03.020
<v Speaker 1>but you where he can tear through the four seasons in a weekend.</v>

618
00:15:03.321 --> 00:15:04.910

00:15:04.911 --> 00:15:07.100
<v Speaker 1>48 hours of television.</v>

620
00:15:07.190 --> 00:15:08.120
<v Speaker 1>I missed last though.</v>

621
00:15:08.121 --> 00:15:08.930
<v Speaker 1>I can't stop.</v>

622
00:15:08.930 --> 00:15:11.210
<v Speaker 1>I wish I could talk about loss and theories.</v>

623
00:15:11.410 --> 00:15:12.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm missing go fuck itself.</v>

624
00:15:13.070 --> 00:15:14.930
<v Speaker 1>I Know Jack killed it for me.</v>

625
00:15:14.931 --> 00:15:17.840
<v Speaker 1>Who send it in by the end of the show there's like,</v>

626
00:15:17.841 --> 00:15:17.991
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

627
00:15:17.991 --> 00:15:19.130
<v Speaker 1>I guess they brought him back to life.</v>

628
00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:22.850
<v Speaker 1>He was like completely phoning in it and towards the end of the show Jack,</v>

629
00:15:22.851 --> 00:15:23.690
<v Speaker 1>he killed it for me.</v>

630
00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:24.591
<v Speaker 1>That was the doctor.</v>

631
00:15:24.591 --> 00:15:25.230
<v Speaker 1>Doctor.</v>

632
00:15:25.230 --> 00:15:26.300
<v Speaker 1>Doctor killed it for me.</v>

633
00:15:26.450 --> 00:15:27.320
<v Speaker 1>I had to stop watching.</v>

634
00:15:27.730 --> 00:15:28.341
<v Speaker 1>I had stopped watching.</v>

635
00:15:28.341 --> 00:15:28.521
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

636
00:15:28.521 --> 00:15:29.660
<v Speaker 1>this guy is not really there.</v>

637
00:15:29.810 --> 00:15:31.100
<v Speaker 1>He is not in the moment here.</v>

638
00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:31.431
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

639
00:15:31.431 --> 00:15:34.570
<v Speaker 1>I'm not believing that you just dumped a body in this fountain and then brought</v>

640
00:15:34.590 --> 00:15:34.961
<v Speaker 1>in front of you.</v>

641
00:15:34.961 --> 00:15:36.560
<v Speaker 1>You barely paid attention deuce.</v>

642
00:15:36.590 --> 00:15:37.270
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

643
00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:37.610
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

644
00:15:37.610 --> 00:15:39.540
<v Speaker 1>I kind of fell off with I,</v>

645
00:15:40.090 --> 00:15:42.380
<v Speaker 1>I kind of fell off with loss pretty quickly.</v>

646
00:15:42.410 --> 00:15:43.730
<v Speaker 1>It was fun for awhile,</v>

647
00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:46.100
<v Speaker 1>but it can't fuck with Battlestar Galactica.</v>

648
00:15:46.490 --> 00:15:51.490
<v Speaker 1>Battlestar Galactica was one of the best unexpected fun shows to follow.</v>

649
00:15:52.010 --> 00:15:53.840
<v Speaker 1>That's a good God damn show.</v>

650
00:15:54.110 --> 00:15:55.700
<v Speaker 1>That was a really good fucking show.</v>

651
00:15:55.701 --> 00:15:56.840
<v Speaker 1>If you want to like sit down.</v>

652
00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:58.280
<v Speaker 1>I think they went a few seasons.</v>

653
00:15:58.281 --> 00:16:00.030
<v Speaker 1>How many seasons did they go for?</v>

654
00:16:00.031 --> 00:16:01.010
<v Speaker 1>Five or something like that.</v>

655
00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:02.510
<v Speaker 1>Either way.</v>

656
00:16:02.510 --> 00:16:03.980
<v Speaker 1>It's a bad ass fucking show.</v>

657
00:16:04.310 --> 00:16:05.060
<v Speaker 1>That's a good show.</v>

658
00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:08.450
<v Speaker 1>I watched the whole thing on DVD almost after the fact.</v>

659
00:16:08.451 --> 00:16:10.940
<v Speaker 1>Then caught up right at the very last season.</v>

660
00:16:11.210 --> 00:16:12.440
<v Speaker 1>You just have to be in the mood.</v>

661
00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:14.960
<v Speaker 1>It's like when you tear through a book or something,</v>

662
00:16:14.961 --> 00:16:18.860
<v Speaker 1>like sometimes I'll have like three books that I want to read and they just sit</v>

663
00:16:18.861 --> 00:16:19.400
<v Speaker 1>there and I'm like,</v>

664
00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:19.590
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

665
00:16:19.590 --> 00:16:21.470
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to touch them yet.</v>

666
00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:24.790
<v Speaker 1>But then when you do make a commitment and you just fly through it,</v>

667
00:16:25.130 --> 00:16:27.650
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people probably angry at me for what I said about lost.</v>

668
00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:29.940
<v Speaker 1>I used to love the sharp people don't get,</v>

669
00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:31.080
<v Speaker 1>don't get me running and she gave,</v>

670
00:16:31.190 --> 00:16:32.001
<v Speaker 1>I used to love the show.</v>

671
00:16:32.001 --> 00:16:32.650
<v Speaker 1>I'd love to show,</v>

672
00:16:32.650 --> 00:16:34.250
<v Speaker 1>but it did bug me for real.</v>

673
00:16:34.251 --> 00:16:34.950
<v Speaker 1>It did bug me.</v>

674
00:16:34.950 --> 00:16:37.730
<v Speaker 1>I kind of explained a lot of that.</v>

675
00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:38.720
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

676
00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:39.553
<v Speaker 1>I believe you.</v>

677
00:16:40.070 --> 00:16:40.641
<v Speaker 1>But you know what?</v>

678
00:16:40.641 --> 00:16:42.350
<v Speaker 1>I love the fact that I never watched the ending.</v>

679
00:16:42.890 --> 00:16:45.230
<v Speaker 1>You don't see it like that because it means you didn't get me.</v>

680
00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:46.190
<v Speaker 1>You don't even need,</v>

681
00:16:46.190 --> 00:16:46.440
<v Speaker 1>ain't going.</v>

682
00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:46.880
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

683
00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:47.631
<v Speaker 1>he didn't get me.</v>

684
00:16:47.631 --> 00:16:48.464
<v Speaker 1>Bitch.</v>

685
00:16:48.590 --> 00:16:49.640
<v Speaker 1>I snuck away clean.</v>

686
00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:51.440
<v Speaker 1>I no longer feel your pole.</v>

687
00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:52.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

688
00:16:52.010 --> 00:16:53.180
<v Speaker 1>I no longer feel your poll.</v>

689
00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:54.860
<v Speaker 1>I'm afraid you're a dealer.</v>

690
00:16:54.861 --> 00:16:55.551
<v Speaker 1>They're all dealers,</v>

691
00:16:55.551 --> 00:16:55.850
<v Speaker 1>bro.</v>

692
00:16:55.850 --> 00:16:57.050
<v Speaker 1>All these people with TV shows,</v>

693
00:16:57.380 --> 00:16:58.220
<v Speaker 1>me included.</v>

694
00:16:58.220 --> 00:16:58.971
<v Speaker 1>I'm guilty as well.</v>

695
00:16:58.971 --> 00:16:59.804
<v Speaker 1>We're all dealers.</v>

696
00:17:00.170 --> 00:17:02.060
<v Speaker 1>Get you hooked on some fucking crazy shit.</v>

697
00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:04.130
<v Speaker 1>I love being hook chain breaking bad man.</v>

698
00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:05.210
<v Speaker 1>That's a great fucking show.</v>

699
00:17:05.860 --> 00:17:06.693
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

700
00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:08.630
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to be spoiler alert,</v>

701
00:17:08.631 --> 00:17:09.470
<v Speaker 1>spoiler alert.</v>

702
00:17:09.650 --> 00:17:12.650
<v Speaker 1>But when he had the dude locked up in the basement and he had that moral</v>

703
00:17:12.651 --> 00:17:13.580
<v Speaker 1>decision to make,</v>

704
00:17:14.340 --> 00:17:15.173
<v Speaker 1>did you watch that?</v>

705
00:17:16.830 --> 00:17:17.663
<v Speaker 1>You know he's had,</v>

706
00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:20.750
<v Speaker 1>he's had some altercations with gang bangers and stuff.</v>

707
00:17:20.790 --> 00:17:21.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

708
00:17:21.070 --> 00:17:21.950
<v Speaker 1>there's a meth dealer.</v>

709
00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:25.190
<v Speaker 1>And do you remember the one we had the guy locked up in the basement.</v>

710
00:17:25.191 --> 00:17:26.870
<v Speaker 1>He had to figure out whether you should kill him or not.</v>

711
00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:28.640
<v Speaker 1>Kept this season.</v>

712
00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:29.870
<v Speaker 1>That's how it was last season.</v>

713
00:17:30.050 --> 00:17:30.231
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

714
00:17:30.231 --> 00:17:30.770
<v Speaker 1>last year.</v>

715
00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:31.670
<v Speaker 1>I think it was last season.</v>

716
00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:33.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

717
00:17:33.130 --> 00:17:33.530
<v Speaker 1>Either way.</v>

718
00:17:33.530 --> 00:17:38.530
<v Speaker 1>It was like one of the most intense scenes like I think I've ever seen in a,</v>

719
00:17:39.291 --> 00:17:39.591
<v Speaker 1>in a,</v>

720
00:17:39.591 --> 00:17:40.424
<v Speaker 1>in a,</v>

721
00:17:40.670 --> 00:17:42.500
<v Speaker 1>like a made for television show.</v>

722
00:17:42.650 --> 00:17:43.341
<v Speaker 1>It was like a movie.</v>

723
00:17:43.341 --> 00:17:44.174
<v Speaker 1>It was a movie scene.</v>

724
00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:45.260
<v Speaker 1>So fucking intense,</v>

725
00:17:45.261 --> 00:17:46.094
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

726
00:17:46.250 --> 00:17:46.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

727
00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:48.860
<v Speaker 1>That guy can act as fucking ass off.</v>

728
00:17:48.930 --> 00:17:49.763
<v Speaker 1>They're great.</v>

729
00:17:49.950 --> 00:17:51.200
<v Speaker 1>Everybody is great on that one.</v>

730
00:17:51.210 --> 00:17:52.290
<v Speaker 1>What is the lead guy's name?</v>

731
00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:53.570
<v Speaker 4>Bryan Cranston.</v>

732
00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:56.930
<v Speaker 4>And I've really like a Gus man.</v>

733
00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:57.510
<v Speaker 4>That guy.</v>

734
00:17:57.510 --> 00:17:58.140
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

735
00:17:58.140 --> 00:18:00.060
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how up on it you are,</v>

736
00:18:00.061 --> 00:18:01.530
<v Speaker 1>but the last few episodes,</v>

737
00:18:01.531 --> 00:18:02.490
<v Speaker 1>Gus is really,</v>

738

<v Speaker 1>which one's the head?</v>

739
00:18:04.861 --> 00:18:05.740
<v Speaker 1>The like the,</v>

740
00:18:05.890 --> 00:18:07.410
<v Speaker 1>the guy who owns the chicken shops,</v>

741
00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:08.310
<v Speaker 1>the head,</v>

742
00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:12.390
<v Speaker 1>the black dude with the glasses don't drug dealer.</v>

743
00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:13.373
<v Speaker 1>Oh God.</v>

744
00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:14.070
<v Speaker 1>The guy that,</v>

745
00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:14.903
<v Speaker 1>that um,</v>

746
00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:20.510
<v Speaker 1>Walter and Jesse workforce in the bay time lever for fucking television.</v>

747
00:18:20.850 --> 00:18:24.060
<v Speaker 1>I mean it must be right if you stop and think about some of the show,</v>

748
00:18:24.061 --> 00:18:24.900
<v Speaker 1>I mean mad men,</v>

749
00:18:24.901 --> 00:18:26.040
<v Speaker 1>people are really into,</v>

750
00:18:26.041 --> 00:18:27.220
<v Speaker 1>which I'm sure is good.</v>

751
00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:30.450
<v Speaker 1>Three me people were obsessed with mad men.</v>

752
00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:32.270
<v Speaker 1>People were obsessed with you.</v>

753
00:18:32.370 --> 00:18:34.140
<v Speaker 1>Even if you watch anything on NBC,</v>

754
00:18:34.141 --> 00:18:35.190
<v Speaker 1>like any of the new shows,</v>

755
00:18:35.191 --> 00:18:36.480
<v Speaker 1>they fucking all suck.</v>

756
00:18:36.481 --> 00:18:37.620
<v Speaker 1>Like they scare me.</v>

757
00:18:37.621 --> 00:18:38.340
<v Speaker 1>How bad is,</v>

758
00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:39.810
<v Speaker 1>they have laugh tracks again.</v>

759
00:18:39.811 --> 00:18:40.011
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

760
00:18:40.011 --> 00:18:40.201
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

761
00:18:40.201 --> 00:18:40.660
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

762
00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:44.120
<v Speaker 1>it's like there's a show laugh tracks are awesome with Christiana.</v>

763
00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:48.120
<v Speaker 1>I think if you use laugh tracks and you should have to not be good at it,</v>

764
00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:49.470
<v Speaker 1>you should have to do it,</v>

765
00:18:49.471 --> 00:18:49.741
<v Speaker 1>but you,</v>

766
00:18:49.741 --> 00:18:49.911
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

767
00:18:49.911 --> 00:18:50.461
<v Speaker 1>you can't,</v>

768
00:18:50.461 --> 00:18:54.510
<v Speaker 1>you can't like let it fade off here if you're going to use the last track.</v>

769
00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:56.193
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

770
00:18:57.030 --> 00:19:00.360
<v Speaker 1>really obvious and fake people would probably start losing their minds.</v>

771
00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:03.810
<v Speaker 1>Like what would be like driving people crazy idea,</v>

772
00:19:03.811 --> 00:19:04.170
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

773
00:19:04.170 --> 00:19:08.100
<v Speaker 1>The idea of a laugh track where we're going to tell you that it's funny.</v>

774
00:19:08.250 --> 00:19:08.820
<v Speaker 1>We're going to end,</v>

775
00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:10.860
<v Speaker 1>we're not even going to do it in front of a live audience.</v>

776
00:19:11.010 --> 00:19:12.780
<v Speaker 1>We're going to insert some fucking,</v>

777
00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:14.460
<v Speaker 1>this is where we want you to laugh.</v>

778
00:19:14.461 --> 00:19:15.070
<v Speaker 1>Stupid.</v>

779
00:19:15.070 --> 00:19:20.070
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] I think Tim Heidecker tweeted or he's got somebody removed the laugh</v>

780
00:19:22.531 --> 00:19:27.531
<v Speaker 4>track from an episode of Big Bang theory I think or how I met your mother or</v>

781
00:19:27.901 --> 00:19:29.520
<v Speaker 4>something and I didn't hear,</v>

782
00:19:29.790 --> 00:19:33.450
<v Speaker 4>him and Dunkin were talking about it the other night and uh,</v>

783
00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:34.860
<v Speaker 4>I haven't seen it.</v>

784
00:19:35.330 --> 00:19:36.180
<v Speaker 1>Well in all fairness,</v>

785
00:19:36.181 --> 00:19:37.580
<v Speaker 1>what it sounded a little areas,</v>

786
00:19:37.670 --> 00:19:39.110
<v Speaker 1>a lot of those takes,</v>

787
00:19:39.270 --> 00:19:43.730
<v Speaker 1>could have very easily have been a second and third takes of a scene that you do</v>

788
00:19:43.731 --> 00:19:44.810
<v Speaker 1>in front of a live audience.</v>

789
00:19:44.811 --> 00:19:45.980
<v Speaker 1>And they just don't get a laugh.</v>

790
00:19:46.790 --> 00:19:48.830
<v Speaker 1>I think he had somebody go in and just remove it.</v>

791
00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:50.181
<v Speaker 1>Well it could be,</v>

792
00:19:50.181 --> 00:19:50.781
<v Speaker 1>but I'm saying,</v>

793
00:19:50.781 --> 00:19:51.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

794
00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:52.460
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you have to do a scene,</v>

795
00:19:52.630 --> 00:19:52.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

796
00:19:52.930 --> 00:19:53.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

797
00:19:53.150 --> 00:19:55.220
<v Speaker 1>if you're doing like a live sitcom in front of an audience,</v>

798
00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:57.790
<v Speaker 1>like on news radio we would fuck up or you know,</v>

799
00:19:57.880 --> 00:20:01.040
<v Speaker 1>we would have to do something over again cause they wanted to rewrite something.</v>

800
00:20:01.190 --> 00:20:03.380
<v Speaker 1>And so we would do the same scene several times.</v>

801
00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:07.760
<v Speaker 1>So it could very easily have been that even if you don't hear the audience</v>

802
00:20:07.761 --> 00:20:08.570
<v Speaker 1>laughing,</v>

803
00:20:08.570 --> 00:20:12.050
<v Speaker 1>it could have been that we would the film stuff after the fact,</v>

804
00:20:12.051 --> 00:20:13.160
<v Speaker 1>like there was be scenes,</v>

805
00:20:13.161 --> 00:20:14.390
<v Speaker 1>it wouldn't work pickups.</v>

806
00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:15.231
<v Speaker 1>So yeah.</v>

807
00:20:15.231 --> 00:20:15.921
<v Speaker 1>And we would,</v>

808
00:20:15.921 --> 00:20:20.330
<v Speaker 1>we would like make totally new lines and the producers would like fake laugh on</v>

809
00:20:20.331 --> 00:20:21.164
<v Speaker 1>the side.</v>

810
00:20:21.290 --> 00:20:23.990
<v Speaker 1>They will like stand there and [inaudible] and all of jokes,</v>

811
00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:24.903
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

812
00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:25.290
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

813
00:20:25.290 --> 00:20:26.830
<v Speaker 1>it was so alien mouse.</v>

814
00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:27.740
<v Speaker 1>So bizarre.</v>

815
00:20:27.890 --> 00:20:29.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm surprised you weren't offered for two and a half men.</v>

816
00:20:29.980 --> 00:20:30.470
<v Speaker 1>Where are you?</v>

817
00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:30.651
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

818
00:20:30.651 --> 00:20:31.251

<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

820
00:20:31.670 --> 00:20:33.650
<v Speaker 1>I think you'd be up for that.</v>

821
00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:34.760
<v Speaker 1>I'm not famous enough for that.</v>

822
00:20:34.761 --> 00:20:36.360
<v Speaker 1>How long were you on news radio?</v>

823
00:20:36.650 --> 00:20:37.483
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

<v Speaker 1>five years.</v>

825
00:20:38.570 --> 00:20:39.403
<v Speaker 1>I think it would be awesome.</v>

826
00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:41.330
<v Speaker 1>Different.</v>

827
00:20:41.330 --> 00:20:43.070
<v Speaker 1>That's a different level of fame they're looking for.</v>

828
00:20:43.071 --> 00:20:44.960
<v Speaker 1>They're looking for that Ashton Kutcher fame.</v>

829
00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:46.033
<v Speaker 1>That's several.</v>

830
00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:48.050
<v Speaker 1>Ashton Kutcher not be the guy from jackass.</v>

831
00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:48.471
<v Speaker 4>Why is it,</v>

832
00:20:48.471 --> 00:20:50.970
<v Speaker 4>it's so ridiculous this cause the other ones on Twitter or,</v>

833
00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:51.680

<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

837
00:20:56.741 --> 00:20:57.190
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

838
00:20:57.190 --> 00:21:00.610
<v Speaker 4>I think his Twitter followers has gotten into everybody's heads that he's not</v>

<v Speaker 4>He's just,</v>

879
00:21:46.451 --> 00:21:48.340
<v Speaker 4>he seems like he's got his game together.</v>

880
00:21:48.341 --> 00:21:51.970
<v Speaker 4>It was let them do this crazy show game show in my head.</v>

881
00:21:52.470 --> 00:21:53.560
<v Speaker 4>It was pretty good in this show though.</v>

882
00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:55.990
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying I never watched two and a half men in the first place,</v>

883
00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.240
<v Speaker 4>but did you watch the new one?</v>

884
00:21:58.860 --> 00:21:59.940
<v Speaker 4>The new episode with him?</v>

885
00:21:59.980 --> 00:22:01.150
<v Speaker 4>It was very dark,</v>

886
00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:01.781
<v Speaker 4>very like,</v>

887
00:22:01.781 --> 00:22:02.300
<v Speaker 4>whoa.</v>

888
00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:02.540
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>

889
00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:02.840
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

890
00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:03.430
<v Speaker 4>they uh,</v>

891
00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:05.740
<v Speaker 4>took a weird approach where they're making fun of his day.</v>

892
00:22:05.741 --> 00:22:06.700
<v Speaker 4>I kind of want to see it,</v>

893
00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:08.590
<v Speaker 1>watched it before,</v>

894
00:22:08.591 --> 00:22:10.960
<v Speaker 1>but I want to watch it because of the controversy.</v>

895
00:22:11.170 --> 00:22:11.730
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

896
00:22:11.730 --> 00:22:12.350
<v Speaker 1>I want to watch,</v>

897
00:22:12.350 --> 00:22:14.650
<v Speaker 1>I watched one episode once and I thought it was kind of lame.</v>

898
00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:15.311
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

899
00:22:15.311 --> 00:22:16.270
<v Speaker 1>I didn't think it was kind of lame.</v>

900
00:22:16.271 --> 00:22:17.140
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was terrible.</v>

901
00:22:17.470 --> 00:22:18.550
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember what was going on,</v>

902
00:22:18.551 --> 00:22:19.270
<v Speaker 1>but I remember like,</v>

903
00:22:19.270 --> 00:22:20.500
<v Speaker 1>like what is this?</v>

904
00:22:20.860 --> 00:22:21.251
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>

905
00:22:21.251 --> 00:22:21.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

906
00:22:21.780 --> 00:22:23.650
<v Speaker 1>when you see something it's just like alien.</v>

907
00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:24.011
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

908
00:22:24.011 --> 00:22:27.700
<v Speaker 1>it's so not funny that it just te Torques your insides.</v>

909
00:22:27.701 --> 00:22:28.534
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>

910
00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:30.430
<v Speaker 1>And it was like that and so I never watched it again.</v>

911
00:22:30.431 --> 00:22:32.010
<v Speaker 1>But that happens on any sitcoms.</v>

912
00:22:32.011 --> 00:22:33.700
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of weird sitcoms up there.</v>

913
00:22:33.701 --> 00:22:34.151
<v Speaker 1>I left.</v>

914
00:22:34.151 --> 00:22:34.451
<v Speaker 1>I like,</v>

915
00:22:34.451 --> 00:22:35.284
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

916
00:22:35.460 --> 00:22:36.293
<v Speaker 1>I uh,</v>

917
00:22:36.430 --> 00:22:39.310
<v Speaker 1>I watched a couple recently and uh,</v>

918
00:22:39.311 --> 00:22:39.521
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

919
00:22:39.521 --> 00:22:40.180
<v Speaker 1>they just,</v>

920
00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:40.901
<v Speaker 1>they were baffling.</v>

921
00:22:40.901 --> 00:22:41.920
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to say their names.</v>

922
00:22:41.921 --> 00:22:42.140
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

923
00:22:42.140 --> 00:22:42.973
<v Speaker 1>She's hard to do.</v>

924
00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:45.370
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to do a sitcom right now.</v>

925
00:22:46.060 --> 00:22:47.200
<v Speaker 1>Most of them really,</v>

926
00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:49.540
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people get involved in the mix,</v>

927
00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:50.320
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

928
00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:53.230
<v Speaker 1>It's only when someone has like awesome control over things.</v>

929
00:22:53.231 --> 00:22:57.600
<v Speaker 1>Like when one person is artistic vision can truly shine through like the south</v>

930
00:22:57.601 --> 00:22:58.550
<v Speaker 1>park situation.</v>

931
00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:02.980
<v Speaker 1>Those guys are so awesome that no one fucks with them.</v>

932
00:23:02.981 --> 00:23:04.810
<v Speaker 1>So they just do their shit,</v>

933
00:23:05.140 --> 00:23:07.240
<v Speaker 1>which is why their show so fucking brilliant.</v>

934
00:23:07.241 --> 00:23:12.241
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's no more clear APP like point like of a of reference.</v>

935
00:23:12.821 --> 00:23:16.690
<v Speaker 1>If you'd like thinking about like one prime example of a show where you can tell</v>

936
00:23:16.691 --> 00:23:18.640
<v Speaker 1>the artistic minds behind it.</v>

937
00:23:18.641 --> 00:23:20.890
<v Speaker 1>Don't have any influence by anybody else.</v>

938
00:23:20.891 --> 00:23:22.030
<v Speaker 1>It's how far right.</v>

939
00:23:22.031 --> 00:23:22.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

940
00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:24.320
<v Speaker 1>it's cause it's such a money jungle.</v>

941
00:23:25.170 --> 00:23:25.730
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

942
00:23:25.730 --> 00:23:26.110
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

943
00:23:26.110 --> 00:23:26.330
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

944
00:23:26.330 --> 00:23:26.980
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

945
00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:27.161
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

946
00:23:27.161 --> 00:23:28.180
<v Speaker 1>I would say he's right there.</v>

947
00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:29.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

948
00:23:29.170 --> 00:23:29.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

949
00:23:29.530 --> 00:23:30.640
<v Speaker 1>I wish Louie was longer.</v>

950
00:23:30.790 --> 00:23:34.210
<v Speaker 1>I wish they would pay him five times more and just have hour and a half does</v>

951
00:23:34.211 --> 00:23:35.620
<v Speaker 1>everything himself.</v>

952
00:23:35.830 --> 00:23:35.981
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

953
00:23:35.981 --> 00:23:37.240
<v Speaker 1>but when you watch that show,</v>

954
00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:37.970
<v Speaker 1>it's so</v>

955
00:23:37.970 --> 00:23:38.601
<v Speaker 4>short.</v>

956
00:23:38.601 --> 00:23:41.030
<v Speaker 4>Like you really start getting into it and then it just drops out.</v>

957
00:23:41.060 --> 00:23:42.440
<v Speaker 4>It's cause it's like 22 minutes long.</v>

958
00:23:42.441 --> 00:23:42.500
<v Speaker 4>Well</v>

959
00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:46.130
<v Speaker 1>do you think about doing everything yourself and doing it on a laptop?</v>

960
00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:47.000
<v Speaker 5>That's what he does.</v>

961
00:23:47.390 --> 00:23:47.961
<v Speaker 5>He does it all.</v>

962
00:23:47.961 --> 00:23:50.690
<v Speaker 5>He edits it on a fucking 13 inch Mac book pro.</v>

963
00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:51.800
<v Speaker 5>Unless he's like trolling.</v>

964
00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:52.673
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

965
00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:57.610
<v Speaker 2>he's trying to play the like fucking super hard worker do it.</v>

966
00:23:57.630 --> 00:24:02.630
<v Speaker 2>But really it's got like a whole crew credited you Mexicans with fucking stolen</v>

967
00:24:03.571 --> 00:24:04.260
<v Speaker 2>laptops.</v>

968
00:24:04.260 --> 00:24:05.093
<v Speaker 2>It changes.</v>

969
00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:08.320
<v Speaker 2>It goes from like edited by Louis Cane and sometimes it's not edited by the way.</v>

970
00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:08.860
<v Speaker 2>Oh really?</v>

971
00:24:08.860 --> 00:24:10.470
<v Speaker 2>So He has other people working with him</v>

972
00:24:11.660 --> 00:24:13.850
<v Speaker 5>good that he can trust people enough with his baby like that.</v>

973
00:24:13.851 --> 00:24:14.430
<v Speaker 5>But because I,</v>

974
00:24:14.430 --> 00:24:14.901
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

975
00:24:14.901 --> 00:24:17.870
<v Speaker 5>I talked to him after he did his first show at Louis C CK.</v>

976
00:24:17.871 --> 00:24:19.370
<v Speaker 5>Everybody knows if you don't know,</v>

977
00:24:19.510 --> 00:24:23.000
<v Speaker 5>stand up wise is one of the best comics alive.</v>

978
00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:25.850
<v Speaker 5>He's like the elite of the elite.</v>

979
00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:27.440
<v Speaker 5>He's just a great comic,</v>

980
00:24:27.790 --> 00:24:28.041
<v Speaker 5>you know.</v>

981
00:24:28.041 --> 00:24:28.580
<v Speaker 5>But his,</v>

982
00:24:28.580 --> 00:24:30.650
<v Speaker 5>his HBO show,</v>

983
00:24:30.651 --> 00:24:32.180
<v Speaker 5>just what didn't click,</v>

984
00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:32.750
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

985
00:24:32.750 --> 00:24:33.620
<v Speaker 5>some people liked it.</v>

986
00:24:33.621 --> 00:24:34.191
<v Speaker 5>Lucky Louie.</v>

987
00:24:34.191 --> 00:24:35.024
<v Speaker 5>Some people liked it.</v>

988
00:24:35.070 --> 00:24:35.410
<v Speaker 5>It just,</v>

989
00:24:35.410 --> 00:24:37.100
<v Speaker 5>there was something off about it.</v>

990
00:24:37.101 --> 00:24:37.934
<v Speaker 5>There was something,</v>

991
00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:39.050
<v Speaker 5>there was two,</v>

992
00:24:39.170 --> 00:24:42.680
<v Speaker 5>two ham handed and I talked to him about it and I said,</v>

993
00:24:42.681 --> 00:24:42.921
<v Speaker 5>if he,</v>

994
00:24:42.921 --> 00:24:43.900
<v Speaker 5>if he could do it all over again,</v>

995
00:24:43.910 --> 00:24:44.760
<v Speaker 5>what would you do differently?</v>

996
00:24:44.770 --> 00:24:45.201
<v Speaker 5>He was like,</v>

997
00:24:45.201 --> 00:24:45.560
<v Speaker 5>I would,</v>

998
00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:46.700
<v Speaker 5>I would fire everybody.</v>

999
00:24:47.030 --> 00:24:47.721
<v Speaker 5>He goes on fire,</v>

1000
00:24:47.721 --> 00:24:48.620
<v Speaker 5>all the writers and he goes,</v>

1001
00:24:48.621 --> 00:24:48.920
<v Speaker 5>I'm saying,</v>

1002
00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:49.521
<v Speaker 5>I'm sorry.</v>

1003
00:24:49.521 --> 00:24:50.170
<v Speaker 5>You know you're,</v>

1004
00:24:50.170 --> 00:24:50.661
<v Speaker 5>you're my friend.</v>

1005
00:24:50.661 --> 00:24:50.991
<v Speaker 5>I love you,</v>

1006
00:24:50.991 --> 00:24:52.880
<v Speaker 5>but I need someone else to do this.</v>

1007
00:24:52.881 --> 00:24:54.140
<v Speaker 5>I got one shot at this.</v>

1008
00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:55.580
<v Speaker 5>I got one shot at this to do this.</v>

1009
00:24:55.581 --> 00:24:56.240
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1010
00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:56.720
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

1011
00:24:56.720 --> 00:24:57.291
<v Speaker 5>And so you know,</v>

1012
00:24:57.291 --> 00:24:57.681
<v Speaker 5>when he did,</v>

1013
00:24:57.681 --> 00:24:58.011
<v Speaker 5>he did.</v>

1014
00:24:58.011 --> 00:24:58.880
<v Speaker 5>He fired everybody.</v>

1015
00:24:59.150 --> 00:24:59.930
<v Speaker 5>Now he's doing it.</v>

1016
00:24:59.930 --> 00:25:01.220
<v Speaker 5>All of it himself,</v>

1017
00:25:01.310 --> 00:25:02.030
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

1018
00:25:02.030 --> 00:25:02.863
<v Speaker 5>That's amazing.</v>

1019
00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:06.380
<v Speaker 2>It's so weird how he showed doesn't fall any kind of guideline like,</v>

1020
00:25:06.410 --> 00:25:09.410
<v Speaker 2>like one day his daughter is somebody else.</v>

1021
00:25:10.810 --> 00:25:11.643
<v Speaker 2>Girlfriend's</v>

1022
00:25:13.670 --> 00:25:15.060
<v Speaker 2>daughters are pretty consistent.</v>

1023
00:25:15.061 --> 00:25:16.330
<v Speaker 2>I know her kids,</v>

1024
00:25:16.730 --> 00:25:17.563
<v Speaker 2>not all the time.</v>

1025
00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:18.621
<v Speaker 2>It changes.</v>

1026
00:25:18.621 --> 00:25:20.900
<v Speaker 2>There was like a totally different girl there the other day and I'm like,</v>

1027
00:25:20.901 --> 00:25:21.770
<v Speaker 2>who's this girl?</v>

1028
00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:22.260
<v Speaker 2>Are you sure?</v>

1029
00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:22.831
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1030
00:25:22.831 --> 00:25:24.470
<v Speaker 2>Are you sure about that man?</v>

1031
00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:25.670
<v Speaker 2>Almost.</v>

1032
00:25:25.670 --> 00:25:27.380
<v Speaker 2>I'd probably say 99% sure.</v>

1033
00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:29.780
<v Speaker 2>I would think to doubt about that.</v>

1034
00:25:29.930 --> 00:25:31.020
<v Speaker 2>I was Louie,</v>

1035
00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:33.590
<v Speaker 2>if I could deal with the daughter,</v>

1036
00:25:33.591 --> 00:25:36.440
<v Speaker 2>I would think that he would work out a deal with the daughter because they have</v>

1037
00:25:36.441 --> 00:25:39.670
<v Speaker 2>a handful of episodes that revolve around the daughters.</v>

1038
00:25:39.770 --> 00:25:44.240
<v Speaker 2>I think I have to make sure that that would take me out of the show a little</v>

1039
00:25:44.241 --> 00:25:44.570
<v Speaker 2>bit.</v>

1040
00:25:44.570 --> 00:25:46.070
<v Speaker 2>It's daughters kept changing.</v>

1041
00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:47.270
<v Speaker 2>That would fuck with my head.</v>

1042
00:25:47.390 --> 00:25:48.900
<v Speaker 2>I'll have to take,</v>

1043
00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:50.030
<v Speaker 2>it kind of freaks me out.</v>

1044
00:25:50.031 --> 00:25:50.300
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

1045
00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:50.610
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1046
00:25:50.610 --> 00:25:51.800
<v Speaker 2>I'm a huge fan of that show,</v>

1047
00:25:51.801 --> 00:25:55.880
<v Speaker 2>so I'm pretty sure unless I was just dreaming the whole thing once rogue and was</v>

1048
00:25:55.881 --> 00:25:56.690
<v Speaker 2>kissing some guy,</v>

1049
00:25:56.690 --> 00:25:56.931

<v Speaker 2>The other guy was delicious.</v>

1057
00:26:06.230 --> 00:26:07.280
<v Speaker 2>We need to take less of those,</v>

00:26:15.470 --> 00:26:16.303
<v Speaker 2>It's not going to talk.</v>

1067
00:26:16.490 --> 00:26:18.350
<v Speaker 2>Did you see a website by the way?</v>

1068
00:26:18.710 --> 00:26:19.543
<v Speaker 5>On the banner?</v>

1069

00:26:19.971 --> 00:26:21.110
<v Speaker 5>There's a banner on my website.</v>

1071
00:26:21.111 --> 00:26:22.970

00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:29.300
<v Speaker 5>It's becoming an Alpha brand commercial.</v>

1076
00:26:29.301 --> 00:26:30.380
<v Speaker 5>I think we better stop for kids</v>

00:26:56.490 --> 00:26:57.870
<v Speaker 2>Made this shit myself.</v>

1090
00:26:58.710 --> 00:26:59.970
<v Speaker 2>My special blend.</v>

1091
00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:05.020
<v Speaker 2>So I was over listening to a gay guy the other day at the comedy store.</v>

1092
00:27:05.030 --> 00:27:06.420
<v Speaker 2>We're over listening to a gay guy.</v>

1093
00:27:08.060 --> 00:27:10.960
<v Speaker 2>I was paying too much attention and uh,</v>

1094
00:27:10.980 --> 00:27:13.350
<v Speaker 2>he was going off on one of these like how everybody's gay.</v>

1095
00:27:13.351 --> 00:27:15.060
<v Speaker 2>Like we were looking at the billboard,</v>

1096
00:27:15.061 --> 00:27:18.360
<v Speaker 2>which was that guy from CNN that just moved to like Fox with Anderson Cooper.</v>

1097
00:27:18.590 --> 00:27:19.050
<v Speaker 2>And he was like,</v>

1098
00:27:19.050 --> 00:27:19.740
<v Speaker 2>just like,</v>

1099
00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:21.510
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe he hasn't come out yet.</v>

1100
00:27:21.511 --> 00:27:22.171
<v Speaker 2>He's Super Gay.</v>

1101
00:27:22.171 --> 00:27:23.270
<v Speaker 2>I know a lot of people that said,</v>

1102
00:27:23.271 --> 00:27:24.250
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>

1103
00:27:25.220 --> 00:27:26.053
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1104
00:27:26.740 --> 00:27:27.000
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1105
00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:27.301
<v Speaker 2>I see.</v>

1106
00:27:27.301 --> 00:27:27.781
<v Speaker 2>I had no idea.</v>

1107
00:27:27.781 --> 00:27:28.614
<v Speaker 2>I don't even fucking,</v>

1108
00:27:28.820 --> 00:27:29.820
<v Speaker 2>and you're trying to out him,</v>

1109
00:27:29.821 --> 00:27:30.350
<v Speaker 2>look at you.</v>

1110
00:27:30.350 --> 00:27:30.580
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

1111
00:27:30.580 --> 00:27:31.920
<v Speaker 2>and then he was saying how that nobody,</v>

1112
00:27:31.980 --> 00:27:36.980
<v Speaker 2>here's the words that he was saying how the new president of a apple is gay and</v>

1113
00:27:37.441 --> 00:27:38.191
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know that.</v>

1114
00:27:38.191 --> 00:27:39.810
<v Speaker 2>So now I'm just wondering if it's,</v>

1115
00:27:39.811 --> 00:27:41.490
<v Speaker 2>so now max really will be gay.</v>

00:27:41.701 --> 00:27:43.810
<v Speaker 2>We're going back to shiny white Arizona</v>

1118
00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:46.400
<v Speaker 1>because people are always like back Sergei</v>

1119
00:27:48.790 --> 00:27:49.800
<v Speaker 1>online man,</v>

1120
00:27:49.850 --> 00:27:50.400
<v Speaker 1>you're old.</v>

1121
00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:50.671
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

00:27:50.671 --> 00:27:53.500
<v Speaker 1>Well those are the best kissers online.</v>

1123
00:27:53.630 --> 00:27:58.630
<v Speaker 1>The message boards and shit and Max are always treated as pretentious slobs who</v>

1124
00:27:58.981 --> 00:28:02.260
<v Speaker 1>can't work real computers like the vast majority are really,</v>

1125
00:28:02.310 --> 00:28:04.920
<v Speaker 1>it seems like there's a camp,</v>

1126
00:28:04.921 --> 00:28:06.930
<v Speaker 1>there's a PC camp and there's a Mac camp.</v>

1127
00:28:06.931 --> 00:28:09.600
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that people always say is Max or gay,</v>

1128
00:28:09.950 --> 00:28:12.990
<v Speaker 1>but now max really are gay dude.</v>

00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:15.860
<v Speaker 1>I wonder what gay things are going to happen to our Max.</v>

1131
00:28:15.870 --> 00:28:16.703

1135
00:28:20.221 --> 00:28:23.640

<v Speaker 1>The house pitches and the startup times quicker than ever.</v>

1166
00:29:16.190 --> 00:29:17.410
<v Speaker 1>I was watching something on,</v>

1167
00:29:17.411 --> 00:29:20.570
<v Speaker 1>on the online where they're showing how quick the startup time is a windows</v>

1168
00:29:20.571 --> 00:29:23.630
<v Speaker 1>eight and from the time you press the button,</v>

1169
00:29:24.170 --> 00:29:27.980
<v Speaker 1>eight seconds and windows eight starts up and it's like really quick.</v>

1170
00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:28.651
<v Speaker 1>It's like Doo,</v>

1171
00:29:28.651 --> 00:29:28.761
<v Speaker 1>Doo,</v>

1172
00:29:28.761 --> 00:29:28.861
<v Speaker 1>Doo,</v>

1173
00:29:28.861 --> 00:29:29.330
<v Speaker 1>Doo Doo.</v>

1174
00:29:29.330 --> 00:29:29.931
<v Speaker 1>So what,</v>

1175
00:29:29.931 --> 00:29:34.931
<v Speaker 1>when it runs it sucks theater but we know who's freaking out about how long it</v>

1176
00:29:35.361 --> 00:29:36.680
<v Speaker 1>takes her computer to start,</v>

1177
00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:39.080
<v Speaker 1>isn't it on most of the time,</v>

1178
00:29:39.081 --> 00:29:42.160
<v Speaker 1>99.9% of what the fuck are you even my</v>

1179
00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:44.830
<v Speaker 2>computer's a piece of shit and uh,</v>

1180
00:29:45.430 --> 00:29:47.590
<v Speaker 2>it starts up fast enough for like,</v>

1181
00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:49.000
<v Speaker 2>do you give viruses?</v>

1182
00:29:49.990 --> 00:29:50.410
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1183
00:29:50.410 --> 00:29:51.100
<v Speaker 2>never.</v>

1184
00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:52.150
<v Speaker 2>You don't go to the dirty,</v>

1185
00:29:52.151 --> 00:29:52.571
<v Speaker 2>dirty,</v>

1186
00:29:52.571 --> 00:29:56.690
<v Speaker 2>dirty sites and then all sudden every time you tried to grab the whole browser a</v>

1187
00:29:56.710 --> 00:29:58.240
<v Speaker 2>fucking pop up pops up.</v>

1188
00:29:58.250 --> 00:29:58.900
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1189
00:29:58.900 --> 00:29:59.171
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1190
00:29:59.171 --> 00:30:00.400
<v Speaker 2>It happened with my girls laptop.</v>

1191
00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:02.800
<v Speaker 2>She had this thing called malware or something like that.</v>

1192
00:30:02.801 --> 00:30:03.900
<v Speaker 2>And you all were aware.</v>

1193
00:30:04.420 --> 00:30:05.770
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know what it is because I've been on,</v>

1194
00:30:05.771 --> 00:30:06.221
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1195
00:30:06.221 --> 00:30:10.850
<v Speaker 2>I've heard about where male where all your ticket about is this gay shit.</v>

1196
00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:12.180
<v Speaker 2>All Qa.</v>

1197
00:30:13.150 --> 00:30:17.050
<v Speaker 2>It was so bad that that that Norton didn't do kid and do anything.</v>

1198
00:30:17.051 --> 00:30:18.210
<v Speaker 2>None of the chances aren't doing.</v>

1199
00:30:18.370 --> 00:30:19.920
<v Speaker 2>Jim Norton can do anything about it.</v>

1200
00:30:20.110 --> 00:30:20.943
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1201
00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:25.420
<v Speaker 2>and it got so bad that like there was nothing you could do is I started to do</v>

1202
00:30:25.421 --> 00:30:28.600
<v Speaker 2>registry edits and like fucking tried to add,</v>

1203
00:30:28.601 --> 00:30:30.580
<v Speaker 2>do safe mode things just to get this thing off.</v>

1204
00:30:30.610 --> 00:30:33.010
<v Speaker 2>It was like sending information.</v>

1205
00:30:33.190 --> 00:30:35.200
<v Speaker 2>It was a reading passwords.</v>

1206
00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:36.110
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

1207
00:30:36.110 --> 00:30:38.440
<v Speaker 2>it tricked itself as a,</v>

1208
00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:38.740
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1209
00:30:38.740 --> 00:30:41.110
<v Speaker 2>windows of virus protection.</v>

1210
00:30:41.290 --> 00:30:42.940
<v Speaker 2>So on top of it it was like saying,</v>

1211
00:30:42.941 --> 00:30:45.250
<v Speaker 2>here's the way to get this off your computer.</v>

1212
00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:48.430
<v Speaker 2>Click here to buy this virus scanning software.</v>

1213
00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:52.030
<v Speaker 2>And so then now you're giving your credit card information and sending your shit</v>

1214
00:30:52.031 --> 00:30:55.450
<v Speaker 2>just to get some fucking thing to unlock on your computer to get your computer</v>

1215
00:30:55.451 --> 00:30:56.000
<v Speaker 2>back.</v>

1216
00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:57.350
<v Speaker 2>So I had to fucking company,</v>

1217
00:30:57.480 --> 00:30:58.450
<v Speaker 2>like I even,</v>

1218
00:30:58.570 --> 00:30:59.800
<v Speaker 2>I followed all these instructors.</v>

1219
00:30:59.810 --> 00:31:04.030
<v Speaker 2>I finally pretty much just had to wipe the whole thing and it was so common.</v>

1220
00:31:04.031 --> 00:31:06.520
<v Speaker 2>I found out like this is a normal thing that a lot of people get.</v>

1221
00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:09.370
<v Speaker 2>This is not like some crazy virus she got out of nowhere.</v>

1222
00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:10.541
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>

1223
00:31:10.541 --> 00:31:11.470
<v Speaker 2>What is it called?</v>

1224
00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:12.673
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1225
00:31:12.730 --> 00:31:15.100
<v Speaker 2>something antivirus.</v>

1226
00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:16.393
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1227
00:31:18.550 --> 00:31:21.790
<v Speaker 5>I read something insane like the number of,</v>

1228
00:31:21.791 --> 00:31:21.970
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1229
00:31:21.970 --> 00:31:25.300
<v Speaker 5>what are the number of computer viruses out there?</v>

1230
00:31:25.900 --> 00:31:26.800
<v Speaker 5>What would you say it is?</v>

1231
00:31:27.530 --> 00:31:27.741
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1232
00:31:27.741 --> 00:31:28.730
<v Speaker 2>there's a ton of them.</v>

1233
00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:29.480
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1234
00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:31.960
<v Speaker 2>It's 480,000 I would say.</v>

1235
00:31:32.540 --> 00:31:33.650
<v Speaker 2>I'd probably say it's in the millions.</v>

1236
00:31:35.420 --> 00:31:36.253
<v Speaker 6>Millions.</v>

1237
00:31:37.930 --> 00:31:41.440
<v Speaker 5>I'm trying to find it because it's so ridiculous.</v>

1238
00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:42.570
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

1239
00:31:42.570 --> 00:31:44.130
<v Speaker 2>But Apple's sucking a Dick Lately,</v>

1240
00:31:44.131 --> 00:31:45.480
<v Speaker 2>so I might be going back to PC.</v>

1241
00:31:45.510 --> 00:31:47.760
<v Speaker 2>I just got that final cut pro and I had to pretty much read,</v>

1242
00:31:47.761 --> 00:31:48.990
<v Speaker 2>learn everything.</v>

1243
00:31:49.020 --> 00:31:51.710
<v Speaker 2>And I feel dumb because it's so s one</v>

1244
00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:54.380
<v Speaker 5>that's just one program though.</v>

1245
00:31:54.610 --> 00:31:55.030
<v Speaker 2>Well that's,</v>

1246
00:31:55.030 --> 00:31:56.590
<v Speaker 2>that's one of their main programs.</v>

1247
00:31:56.591 --> 00:31:58.180
<v Speaker 2>They pretty much decided to take their main</v>

1248
00:31:58.860 --> 00:32:00.850
<v Speaker 5>mad at all of apple because of one thing.</v>

1249
00:32:00.990 --> 00:32:01.823
<v Speaker 2>Oh No.</v>

1250
00:32:02.010 --> 00:32:04.590
<v Speaker 2>Well I mean if that's the direction they're going where they're like making</v>

1251
00:32:04.591 --> 00:32:05.820
<v Speaker 2>everything more,</v>

1252
00:32:06.300 --> 00:32:07.133
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

1253
00:32:07.140 --> 00:32:10.770
<v Speaker 2>like friendly or ha look easy looking or you know,</v>

1254
00:32:10.771 --> 00:32:12.720
<v Speaker 2>simple cut and paste,</v>

1255
00:32:12.990 --> 00:32:13.321
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

1256
00:32:13.321 --> 00:32:14.010
<v Speaker 2>And that like,</v>

1257
00:32:14.010 --> 00:32:14.640
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1258
00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:17.250
<v Speaker 2>the old final cut pro is like you had pretty much,</v>

1259
00:32:17.251 --> 00:32:18.390
<v Speaker 2>you could do anything you want.</v>

1260
00:32:18.830 --> 00:32:19.140
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1261
00:32:19.140 --> 00:32:20.000
<v Speaker 2>this is like you're,</v>

1262
00:32:20.110 --> 00:32:20.321
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

1263
00:32:20.321 --> 00:32:24.150
<v Speaker 2>you have to do like backwards steps and do all this extra bullshit just cause it</v>

1264
00:32:24.151 --> 00:32:24.671
<v Speaker 2>looks pretty.</v>

1265
00:32:24.671 --> 00:32:24.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1266
00:32:24.770 --> 00:32:25.051
<v Speaker 5>Well listen,</v>

1267
00:32:25.051 --> 00:32:27.380
<v Speaker 5>how crazy this answer as to how many computer viruses,</v>

1268
00:32:28.770 --> 00:32:31.080
<v Speaker 5>it's not exactly known,</v>

1269
00:32:31.170 --> 00:32:33.480
<v Speaker 5>but most likely in the millions.</v>

1270
00:32:33.630 --> 00:32:36.930
<v Speaker 5>The real problem is that new ones pop up every day.</v>

1271
00:32:37.110 --> 00:32:37.943
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1272
00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:39.170
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

1273
00:32:39.170 --> 00:32:40.003
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

1274
00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:40.221
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1275
00:32:40.221 --> 00:32:41.750
<v Speaker 2>I guess millions.</v>

1276
00:32:41.870 --> 00:32:43.970
<v Speaker 2>Millions meant well from,</v>

1277
00:32:44.030 --> 00:32:45.950
<v Speaker 2>Oh that are out there right now.</v>

1278
00:32:45.951 --> 00:32:50.120
<v Speaker 2>Or from the stealing your personal information that exist.</v>

1279
00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:51.441
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1280
00:32:51.441 --> 00:32:52.200
<v Speaker 2>I don't know ma'am.</v>

1281
00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:52.801
<v Speaker 1>Possible.</v>

1282
00:32:52.801 --> 00:32:53.210
<v Speaker 1>How can going,</v>

1283
00:32:53.210 --> 00:32:54.660
<v Speaker 1>somebody might just be talking shit,</v>

1284
00:32:54.661 --> 00:32:56.220
<v Speaker 1>I need to get verification.</v>

1285
00:32:56.520 --> 00:33:00.510
<v Speaker 1>Milligan's you've got to think how many people does it take to make one computer</v>

1286
00:33:00.511 --> 00:33:01.344
<v Speaker 1>virus?</v>

1287
00:33:01.590 --> 00:33:05.580
<v Speaker 1>Why is it just one dude alone just gets crazy and makes us on his own?</v>

1288
00:33:05.581 --> 00:33:06.900
<v Speaker 1>Or is there other people involved?</v>

1289
00:33:06.901 --> 00:33:08.160
<v Speaker 1>Like how many people are making these things?</v>

1290
00:33:08.230 --> 00:33:09.060
<v Speaker 1>I think what it is though,</v>

1291
00:33:09.060 --> 00:33:11.730
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of these viruses are just all variation.</v>

1292
00:33:11.740 --> 00:33:14.580
<v Speaker 1>So like you'll have one virus that somebody will change something small in it,</v>

1293
00:33:14.581 --> 00:33:17.370
<v Speaker 1>like the ports or whatever and it's called something else.</v>

1294
00:33:17.371 --> 00:33:17.611
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1295
00:33:17.611 --> 00:33:19.380
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's like all new voters.</v>

1296
00:33:19.381 --> 00:33:22.350
<v Speaker 1>People get out of it just like mischief fucking with people.</v>

1297
00:33:22.390 --> 00:33:24.490
<v Speaker 1>Apparently there's the ones that go,</v>

1298
00:33:26.130 --> 00:33:29.880
<v Speaker 1>that's all their goals is to steal your information or you're trying to get your</v>

1299
00:33:29.881 --> 00:33:30.740
<v Speaker 1>credit card information.</v>

1300
00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:32.910
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people have all that stuff stored on their,</v>

1301
00:33:32.911 --> 00:33:33.210
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1302
00:33:33.210 --> 00:33:34.080
<v Speaker 1>on their computers.</v>

1303
00:33:34.110 --> 00:33:34.620
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1304
00:33:34.620 --> 00:33:35.161
<v Speaker 1>they have,</v>

1305
00:33:35.161 --> 00:33:35.430
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>A lot of beautiful girls.</v>

1465
00:38:08.730 --> 00:38:08.881
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

1468
00:38:12.361 --> 00:38:13.740
<v Speaker 1>which is very strange.</v>

1469
00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:15.960
<v Speaker 1>Like everybody like dresses up.</v>

1470
00:38:15.961 --> 00:38:18.000
<v Speaker 1>Like they're from a different time period.</v>

1471
00:38:18.001 --> 00:38:18.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

00:38:20.611 --> 00:38:22.680
<v Speaker 1>although beautiful is quite aimless.</v>

1475
00:38:22.940 --> 00:38:24.990
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's just a lot of dancing around and you're like,</v>

1476
00:38:24.991 --> 00:38:28.860
<v Speaker 1>I guess you're just celebrating how she was dressed and dancing around.</v>

1477
00:38:28.890 --> 00:38:31.650
<v Speaker 1>It was kind of fun because everybody was drunk and getting into it.</v>

1478
00:38:31.651 --> 00:38:36.220
<v Speaker 1>But it's so many drunks and so many fucking happy people.</v>

1479
00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:38.740
<v Speaker 1>Like I didn't see a single angry drunk.</v>

1480
00:38:39.460 --> 00:38:42.550
<v Speaker 1>It was weird cause like there's so many people drunk,</v>

00:38:46.811 --> 00:38:50.800
<v Speaker 1>to Jeff and Jeff took us around and Jeff was talking to us about how he could</v>

1484
00:38:50.801 --> 00:38:55.000
<v Speaker 1>only live in New Orleans because he had lived outside of New Orleans only for a</v>

1485
00:38:55.001 --> 00:38:55.780
<v Speaker 1>little bit.</v>

1486
00:38:55.780 --> 00:38:58.600
<v Speaker 1>And he got in trouble with a cop because the cop,</v>

1487
00:38:58.601 --> 00:39:01.900
<v Speaker 1>he's talking to the cop about something and he was drinking a beer on the</v>

1488
00:39:01.901 --> 00:39:02.510
<v Speaker 1>street.</v>

1489
00:39:02.510 --> 00:39:05.080
<v Speaker 1>The cop was asking him where he's coming from and he didn't know that you're not</v>

1490
00:39:05.081 --> 00:39:06.490
<v Speaker 1>allowed to drink beer on the street.</v>

1491
00:39:07.930 --> 00:39:09.310
<v Speaker 1>You can drink beer anywhere.</v>

1492
00:39:09.311 --> 00:39:10.630
<v Speaker 1>You just drink beer on the street.</v>

1493
00:39:10.780 --> 00:39:12.400
<v Speaker 1>So while he's talking to the cop,</v>

1494
00:39:12.401 --> 00:39:12.731
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>

1500
00:39:19.901 --> 00:39:20.351
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>

00:39:20.351 --> 00:39:20.921

00:40:35.780 --> 00:40:38.410
<v Speaker 1>it's really a national treasure.</v>

1554
00:40:38.590 --> 00:40:41.800
<v Speaker 1>The fact that a place like this exists and this uptight,</v>

1555
00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:46.920
<v Speaker 1>stuck up fucking just scared country we live in now that you could go to a place</v>

00:40:54.580 --> 00:40:55.540
<v Speaker 1>strip club,</v>

1561
00:40:55.541 --> 00:40:56.860
<v Speaker 1>bar foods.</v>

1562
00:40:57.140 --> 00:40:58.470

1563
00:40:58.690 --> 00:40:58.991
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1564
00:40:58.991 --> 00:40:59.770
<v Speaker 1>chickens,</v>

1565
00:40:59.770 --> 00:41:04.770
<v Speaker 1>Voodoo all up the street and it's just a swarm like salmon spawning of humanity</v>

1566
00:41:07.510 --> 00:41:11.980
<v Speaker 1>with cups in their hands and everybody is fucking blasted.</v>

1567
00:41:12.490 --> 00:41:14.260
<v Speaker 1>And we're just wondering through the streets,</v>

1568
00:41:14.261 --> 00:41:19.261
<v Speaker 1>checking out the scene and the bars of amazing quote that it don't go the fuck</v>

<v Speaker 1>Outta here.</v>

1570
00:41:20.231 --> 00:41:21.700
<v Speaker 1>No one's close and me,</v>

1571
00:41:21.730 --> 00:41:22.481
<v Speaker 1>no clothes.</v>

1572
00:41:22.481 --> 00:41:23.770
<v Speaker 1>And then she just stays open.</v>

1573
00:41:23.771 --> 00:41:24.640
<v Speaker 1>They're just open,</v>

1574
00:41:25.090 --> 00:41:25.480
<v Speaker 1>open.</v>

1575
00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:26.410
<v Speaker 1>That's tough though.</v>

1576
00:41:26.411 --> 00:41:26.980
<v Speaker 1>Like we,</v>

1577
00:41:26.980 --> 00:41:30.370
<v Speaker 1>I did a show with Stan hope there a few years ago and uh,</v>

1578
00:41:30.970 --> 00:41:33.980
<v Speaker 1>I don't think our show got started until like 1130</v>

1579
00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:34.581
<v Speaker 4>or something.</v>

1580
00:41:34.581 --> 00:41:36.050
<v Speaker 4>So by the time we got out of there,</v>

1581
00:41:36.051 --> 00:41:37.670
<v Speaker 4>it was probably about two.</v>

1582
00:41:37.880 --> 00:41:38.301
<v Speaker 4>And we're like,</v>

1583
00:41:38.301 --> 00:41:38.421
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1584
00:41:38.421 --> 00:41:40.010
<v Speaker 4>let's go get a drink at a bar.</v>

1585
00:41:40.460 --> 00:41:43.280
<v Speaker 4>And we go to this bar and there's people from the show hanging out.</v>

1586
00:41:43.820 --> 00:41:46.520
<v Speaker 4>And I'm like playing pool with a guy and we're getting pretty drunk.</v>

1587
00:41:46.521 --> 00:41:46.591

<v Speaker 4>neighborhood and it,</v>

00:45:23.700 --> 00:45:26.670
<v Speaker 4>that I was going to go out on a date with her and I wouldn't really tip my hat</v>

1733
00:45:26.680 --> 00:45:28.320
<v Speaker 4>on whether I was joking or not.</v>

1734
00:45:28.710 --> 00:45:29.550
<v Speaker 4>And I,</v>

1735
00:45:29.960 --> 00:45:32.490
<v Speaker 4>so I call him in the middle of the night from his wife's,</v>

1736
00:45:32.491 --> 00:45:35.710
<v Speaker 4>from what looks like his wife's number and I use a voice disguise or did make</v>

1737
00:45:35.790 --> 00:45:37.110
<v Speaker 4>kind of sound like a girl.</v>

1738
00:45:37.710 --> 00:45:38.220
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

1739
00:45:38.220 --> 00:45:41.430
<v Speaker 4>basically I tell him I that it's his wife.</v>

1740
00:45:41.431 --> 00:45:42.210
<v Speaker 4>I'm like Yan.</v>

1741
00:45:42.210 --> 00:45:43.290
<v Speaker 4>And of course he thinks it's her,</v>

1742
00:45:43.291 --> 00:45:43.501
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1743
00:45:43.501 --> 00:45:46.740
<v Speaker 4>he just got woken up at four in the morning and I say,</v>

1744
00:45:46.741 --> 00:45:47.460
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1745
00:45:47.460 --> 00:45:47.701
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1746
00:45:47.701 --> 00:45:49.380
<v Speaker 4>I went over to your friend Brennan's tonight.</v>

1747
00:45:52.380 --> 00:45:53.310
<v Speaker 4>Fucked up man.</v>

1748
00:45:54.390 --> 00:45:56.010
<v Speaker 4>I think he raped me.</v>

1749
00:45:56.011 --> 00:45:56.440
<v Speaker 4>And he's like,</v>

1750
00:45:56.440 --> 00:45:57.273
<v Speaker 4>wait,</v>

1751
00:46:00.930 --> 00:46:03.040
<v Speaker 4>it's a fucking big ass.</v>

1752
00:46:03.340 --> 00:46:04.050
<v Speaker 4>His mind.</v>

1753
00:46:04.050 --> 00:46:04.430
<v Speaker 4>But then,</v>

1754
00:46:04.430 --> 00:46:06.270
<v Speaker 4>but it all ends like it all ends up.</v>

1755
00:46:06.271 --> 00:46:06.541
<v Speaker 4>Laughs.</v>

1756
00:46:06.541 --> 00:46:07.350
<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>

1757
00:46:07.350 --> 00:46:08.071
<v Speaker 4>cause then he goes,</v>

1758
00:46:08.071 --> 00:46:09.330
<v Speaker 4>where are you right now?</v>

1759
00:46:09.510 --> 00:46:09.841
<v Speaker 4>And I go,</v>

1760
00:46:09.841 --> 00:46:14.070
<v Speaker 4>I'm in the hospital and then there's like a pause and I say,</v>

1761
00:46:14.370 --> 00:46:16.440
<v Speaker 4>there's Chis all over me.</v>

1762
00:46:17.480 --> 00:46:18.211
<v Speaker 4>And he goes,</v>

1763
00:46:18.211 --> 00:46:19.290
<v Speaker 4>fucking Brendan,</v>

1764
00:46:19.320 --> 00:46:21.510
<v Speaker 4>I know is you fucking card.</v>

1765
00:46:21.511 --> 00:46:24.450
<v Speaker 4>I can't believe you're wasting your card on me.</v>

1766
00:46:25.320 --> 00:46:26.370
<v Speaker 4>How does the card work?</v>

1767
00:46:26.371 --> 00:46:27.031
<v Speaker 4>Cause it should league.</v>

1768
00:46:27.031 --> 00:46:27.571
<v Speaker 4>He just,</v>

1769
00:46:27.571 --> 00:46:28.590
<v Speaker 4>you call an 800,</v>

1770
00:46:28.591 --> 00:46:31.790
<v Speaker 4>like there's an 800 number that you call legal.</v>

1771
00:46:32.060 --> 00:46:32.893
<v Speaker 4>How's this speakers?</v>

1772
00:46:32.970 --> 00:46:35.280
<v Speaker 4>Probably in the last four it there's actually,</v>

1773
00:46:35.281 --> 00:46:35.511
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1774
00:46:35.511 --> 00:46:36.540
<v Speaker 4>it's a lot of people use it.</v>

1775
00:46:36.541 --> 00:46:38.560
<v Speaker 4>Lindsay Lohan and was known to always use that for,</v>

1776
00:46:38.561 --> 00:46:40.020
<v Speaker 4>for for whatever reasons,</v>

1777
00:46:40.410 --> 00:46:41.060
<v Speaker 4>but you can pretty much,</v>

1778
00:46:41.060 --> 00:46:42.510
<v Speaker 4>it's like when you use a calling card,</v>

1779
00:46:42.540 --> 00:46:45.390
<v Speaker 4>like an old school calling card where you call an 800 number and put in your</v>

1780
00:46:45.391 --> 00:46:46.224
<v Speaker 4>code,</v>

1781
00:46:46.790 --> 00:46:50.940
<v Speaker 4>but instead of a code you put in whatever phone number you want and then you put</v>

1782
00:46:50.941 --> 00:46:51.480
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>

1783
00:46:51.480 --> 00:46:53.460
<v Speaker 4>you hit like pound and it calls.</v>

1784
00:46:53.690 --> 00:46:54.060
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

1785
00:46:54.060 --> 00:46:57.600
<v Speaker 4>Making it look like it comes from that and nonmedical and it'll even say like,</v>

1786
00:46:57.960 --> 00:46:58.291
<v Speaker 4>well yeah,</v>

1787
00:46:58.291 --> 00:47:00.030
<v Speaker 4>obviously if it's like red ban,</v>

1788
00:47:00.180 --> 00:47:01.140
<v Speaker 4>if you put in his number,</v>

1789
00:47:01.141 --> 00:47:04.300
<v Speaker 4>his picture comes up on your phone or however ranks when he calls.</v>

1790
00:47:04.770 --> 00:47:06.060
<v Speaker 4>How is that legal?</v>

1791
00:47:06.680 --> 00:47:07.513
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

1792
00:47:08.820 --> 00:47:09.031
<v Speaker 4>To me,</v>

1793
00:47:09.031 --> 00:47:09.864
<v Speaker 4>after a show.</v>

1794
00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:10.831
<v Speaker 4>That's crazy.</v>

1795
00:47:10.831 --> 00:47:11.250
<v Speaker 4>You could,</v>

1796
00:47:11.250 --> 00:47:13.530
<v Speaker 4>you could cause divorces.</v>

1797
00:47:13.770 --> 00:47:16.250
<v Speaker 4>Fucking murdered people.</v>

1798
00:47:16.251 --> 00:47:16.470
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1799
00:47:16.470 --> 00:47:18.150
<v Speaker 4>You can do all kinds of crazy shit to somebody who was,</v>

1800
00:47:18.170 --> 00:47:19.570
<v Speaker 4>I'd never done anything like,</v>

1801
00:47:19.930 --> 00:47:24.330
<v Speaker 4>I've never done any frame on Blake malicious or all the mean people in the world</v>

1802
00:47:24.390 --> 00:47:25.710
<v Speaker 4>with some of the like that.</v>

1803
00:47:25.790 --> 00:47:26.441
<v Speaker 4>Oh God,</v>

1804
00:47:26.441 --> 00:47:26.830
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1805
00:47:26.830 --> 00:47:27.990
<v Speaker 4>they can do some damage.</v>

1806
00:47:28.200 --> 00:47:32.770
<v Speaker 4>There's probably some divorced mother fucker googling spoof card right now.</v>

1807
00:47:32.771 --> 00:47:33.131
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

1808
00:47:33.131 --> 00:47:33.460
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

1809
00:47:33.460 --> 00:47:34.130
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1810
00:47:34.130 --> 00:47:36.580
<v Speaker 4>I probably just got them like 10 grand in business.</v>

1811
00:47:37.520 --> 00:47:39.400
<v Speaker 4>You should start your own spoof card company.</v>

1812
00:47:41.250 --> 00:47:41.471
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1813
00:47:41.471 --> 00:47:42.460
<v Speaker 4>you should run.</v>

1814
00:47:42.730 --> 00:47:43.563
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1815
00:47:44.020 --> 00:47:44.351
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1816
00:47:44.351 --> 00:47:45.180
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1817
00:47:45.180 --> 00:47:47.380
<v Speaker 4>Maybe I'll go away from this comedy thing and</v>

1818
00:47:47.590 --> 00:47:47.940
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1819
00:47:47.940 --> 00:47:49.480
<v Speaker 1>I'll start a whole new industry.</v>

1820
00:47:49.580 --> 00:47:52.900
<v Speaker 1>You need to really get involved in helping people ruin other people's wives</v>

1821
00:47:52.901 --> 00:47:54.820
<v Speaker 1>secretly be,</v>

1822
00:47:54.821 --> 00:47:57.270
<v Speaker 1>they asked the Madison I'm cloak and dagger shit.</v>

1823
00:47:57.310 --> 00:47:58.840
<v Speaker 1>Seems like they shouldn't be able to do that.</v>

1824
00:47:58.841 --> 00:48:01.570
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand how that could possibly be legal.</v>

1825
00:48:02.070 --> 00:48:05.920
<v Speaker 1>How could you possibly be able to pretend you're someone else and call someone?</v>

1826
00:48:06.220 --> 00:48:07.540
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's legal.</v>

1827
00:48:08.410 --> 00:48:10.630
<v Speaker 1>I imagine that that seems like fraud,</v>

1828
00:48:10.780 --> 00:48:11.613
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1829
00:48:12.730 --> 00:48:16.510
<v Speaker 1>I mean it seems like there would be some sort of a Weirdo.</v>

1830
00:48:16.600 --> 00:48:19.970
<v Speaker 1>It's terrorist law to protect you against shit.</v>

1831
00:48:20.190 --> 00:48:22.020
<v Speaker 4>I think it falls in the same categories.</v>

1832
00:48:22.021 --> 00:48:25.320
<v Speaker 4>Like if you write a letter saying that year you're writing it from the White</v>

1833
00:48:25.320 --> 00:48:26.130
<v Speaker 4>House on the returns,</v>

1834
00:48:26.130 --> 00:48:26.590
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1835
00:48:26.590 --> 00:48:27.000
<v Speaker 4>laying on.</v>

1836
00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:27.833
<v Speaker 4>No Dude,</v>

1837
00:48:27.870 --> 00:48:28.703
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

1838
00:48:29.310 --> 00:48:29.971
<v Speaker 4>I mean I,</v>

1839
00:48:29.971 --> 00:48:30.804
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1840
00:48:30.960 --> 00:48:33.450
<v Speaker 4>hopefully I'll get in trouble but I think there's an APP.</v>

1841
00:48:33.480 --> 00:48:33.631
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1842
00:48:33.631 --> 00:48:36.840
<v Speaker 4>I think that it's something that's out there and I don't think it's illegal.</v>

1843
00:48:37.020 --> 00:48:37.201
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1844
00:48:37.201 --> 00:48:38.250
<v Speaker 4>there's a actually an APP.</v>

1845
00:48:38.520 --> 00:48:42.000
<v Speaker 4>It's the voice cause you can also do like unknown number.</v>

1846
00:48:42.480 --> 00:48:43.313
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

1847
00:48:43.350 --> 00:48:45.330
<v Speaker 4>There's an APP that you can buy that's a voice recorder.</v>

1848
00:48:45.331 --> 00:48:50.331
<v Speaker 4>It is called a recorder on the APP store and it's the same kind of idea where</v>

1849
00:48:50.491 --> 00:48:54.510
<v Speaker 4>you put in your credit card information and then it filters the call through</v>

1850
00:48:54.511 --> 00:48:58.230
<v Speaker 4>this app or something like that and it records it for you so you can record</v>

1851
00:48:58.231 --> 00:48:59.940
<v Speaker 4>phone calls using your iPhone.</v>

1852
00:49:00.090 --> 00:49:01.350
<v Speaker 4>It's called record</v>

1853
00:49:02.860 --> 00:49:05.220
<v Speaker 4>to record phone calls using your eyes.</v>

1854
00:49:05.250 --> 00:49:05.760
<v Speaker 4>So yeah.</v>

1855
00:49:05.760 --> 00:49:06.870
<v Speaker 4>Record other people's phones.</v>

1856
00:49:06.900 --> 00:49:07.141
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1857
00:49:07.141 --> 00:49:09.430
<v Speaker 4>it uses like same thing where it's like a calling card.</v>

1858
00:49:09.840 --> 00:49:10.090
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1859
00:49:10.090 --> 00:49:12.360
<v Speaker 4>This doesn't seem to go but yeah.</v>

1860
00:49:12.420 --> 00:49:14.730
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how this is legal but there's even a button,</v>

1861
00:49:14.731 --> 00:49:17.040
<v Speaker 4>this is all recording on the apps on your phone.</v>

1862
00:49:17.041 --> 00:49:19.260
<v Speaker 4>Kid might want to rethink your app.</v>

1863
00:49:19.330 --> 00:49:22.890
<v Speaker 4>There was one point in time when I had four Fart apps on my phone.</v>

1864
00:49:23.960 --> 00:49:26.510
<v Speaker 4>I got a new phone there.</v>

1865
00:49:27.220 --> 00:49:28.680
<v Speaker 4>There were a bunch of free,</v>

1866
00:49:29.600 --> 00:49:31.260
<v Speaker 4>I know that it's all pretty quick,</v>

1867
00:49:31.261 --> 00:49:31.880
<v Speaker 4>but I mean,</v>

1868
00:49:31.880 --> 00:49:32.550
<v Speaker 4>whatever</v>

1869
00:49:32.550 --> 00:49:33.810
<v Speaker 1>three Fart apps,</v>

1870
00:49:34.170 --> 00:49:37.620
<v Speaker 1>what satisfaction that someone have with the mega free fart APP.</v>

1871
00:49:38.720 --> 00:49:42.060
<v Speaker 1>One dude put a Joe Rogan I uh,</v>

1872
00:49:42.600 --> 00:49:43.570
<v Speaker 1>iPhone application.</v>

1873
00:49:43.571 --> 00:49:45.360
<v Speaker 1>Some somebody made one and it's not me,</v>

1874
00:49:45.480 --> 00:49:46.170
<v Speaker 1>it's not mine.</v>

1875
00:49:46.170 --> 00:49:46.980
<v Speaker 1>But he's selling it.</v>

1876
00:49:46.980 --> 00:49:47.640
<v Speaker 1>What to do?</v>

1877
00:49:47.640 --> 00:49:48.473
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1878
00:49:48.690 --> 00:49:49.351
<v Speaker 1>I've looked at it,</v>

1879
00:49:49.351 --> 00:49:50.184
<v Speaker 1>but he's selling it.</v>

1880
00:49:50.190 --> 00:49:50.371
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1881
00:49:50.371 --> 00:49:51.001
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of,</v>

1882
00:49:51.001 --> 00:49:51.960
<v Speaker 1>is he allowed to do that?</v>

1883
00:49:52.140 --> 00:49:52.973
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>

1884
00:49:54.480 --> 00:49:54.980
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1885
00:49:54.980 --> 00:49:56.830
<v Speaker 1>you're the guy who should probably look into,</v>

1886
00:49:56.920 --> 00:49:57.180
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1887
00:49:57.180 --> 00:49:58.320
<v Speaker 1>well I just found out about it.</v>

1888
00:49:58.390 --> 00:50:00.040
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of apps that you have like,</v>

1889
00:50:00.041 --> 00:50:00.280
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1890
00:50:00.280 --> 00:50:01.120
<v Speaker 4>for celebrities,</v>

1891
00:50:01.121 --> 00:50:04.610
<v Speaker 4>they'll have like the Britney spears fan app where it's just like improve your</v>

1892
00:50:04.620 --> 00:50:06.700
<v Speaker 4>home address and that's probably what it is.</v>

1893
00:50:06.701 --> 00:50:08.110
<v Speaker 4>It's probably something like that where it's like,</v>

1894
00:50:08.111 --> 00:50:08.590
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>

1895
00:50:08.590 --> 00:50:09.820
<v Speaker 1>it's like a buck cost.</v>

1896
00:50:09.821 --> 00:50:10.391
<v Speaker 1>A dollar.</v>

1897
00:50:10.391 --> 00:50:11.710
<v Speaker 1>Some someone's selling it.</v>

1898
00:50:11.740 --> 00:50:12.573
<v Speaker 1>You want me to buy it?</v>

1899
00:50:12.640 --> 00:50:12.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1900
00:50:12.940 --> 00:50:13.370

1901
00:50:13.370 --> 00:50:14.203
<v Speaker 1>Let's all buy it.</v>

1902
00:50:14.500 --> 00:50:15.333
<v Speaker 1>Don't do it.</v>

1903
00:50:16.030 --> 00:50:16.863
<v Speaker 1>Let me say it might,</v>

1904
00:50:16.870 --> 00:50:20.860
<v Speaker 1>we're advertising something that's done for the wrong place.</v>

1905
00:50:20.861 --> 00:50:21.910
<v Speaker 1>Hit the dump onto that.</v>

1906
00:50:23.440 --> 00:50:24.273
<v Speaker 1>We don't have a dump.</v>

1907
00:50:24.910 --> 00:50:26.090
<v Speaker 1>There's the seven second delay.</v>

1908
00:50:26.160 --> 00:50:26.440
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1909
00:50:26.440 --> 00:50:27.350

1910
00:50:27.410 --> 00:50:28.070
<v Speaker 1>All that creepy</v>

<v Speaker 5>the world know all that shit.</v>

1913
00:50:30.771 --> 00:50:31.940
<v Speaker 5>I said seven seconds ago.</v>

1914
00:50:31.941 --> 00:50:32.990
<v Speaker 5>Hold on a fucked up shit.</v>

1915
00:50:32.991 --> 00:50:33.824
<v Speaker 5>You were thinking,</v>

1916
00:50:35.120 --> 00:50:35.511
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1917
00:50:35.511 --> 00:50:36.110
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1918
00:50:36.110 --> 00:50:37.160
<v Speaker 5>it brings me up to that,</v>

1919
00:50:37.161 --> 00:50:37.400
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1920
00:50:37.400 --> 00:50:38.540
<v Speaker 5>the rose thing again.</v>

1921
00:50:38.740 --> 00:50:41.390
<v Speaker 5>This is a funny thing about that style of comedy,</v>

1922
00:50:41.391 --> 00:50:41.900
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

1923
00:50:41.900 --> 00:50:45.860
<v Speaker 5>That real mean fucking ridiculous style.</v>

1924
00:50:46.520 --> 00:50:47.353
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1925
00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:51.650
<v Speaker 5>I'm a big fan of that kind of style of comedy is one of the reasons why I was</v>

1926
00:50:51.651 --> 00:50:55.670
<v Speaker 5>kind of upset when that Tracy Morgan thing went down and I was like,</v>

1927
00:50:55.671 --> 00:50:56.180
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1928
00:50:56.180 --> 00:50:56.421
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

1929
00:50:56.421 --> 00:50:59.900
<v Speaker 5>What he said for sure he shouldn't have said that,</v>

1930
00:51:00.140 --> 00:51:02.370
<v Speaker 5>but he's out there swinging.</v>

1931
00:51:02.390 --> 00:51:02.750
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1932
00:51:02.750 --> 00:51:03.830
<v Speaker 5>Crazy pitches.</v>

1933
00:51:04.070 --> 00:51:04.221
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1934
00:51:04.221 --> 00:51:06.530
<v Speaker 5>he's out there saying the most fucked up shit possible.</v>

1935
00:51:06.531 --> 00:51:08.120
<v Speaker 5>It's not that he really means most of this,</v>

1936
00:51:08.310 --> 00:51:08.590
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

1937
00:51:08.590 --> 00:51:09.411
<v Speaker 5>This is his act.</v>

1938
00:51:09.411 --> 00:51:13.490
<v Speaker 5>His Act is ridiculous and extreme and that's what's so funny about it.</v>

1939
00:51:13.520 --> 00:51:13.850
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1940
00:51:13.850 --> 00:51:18.850
<v Speaker 5>It's like this weird line though where people start judging in as a statement,</v>

1941
00:51:19.610 --> 00:51:20.061
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1942
00:51:20.061 --> 00:51:24.620
<v Speaker 5>instead of just as something ridiculous and people are just looking for shit to</v>

1943
00:51:24.621 --> 00:51:25.380
<v Speaker 5>get upset.</v>

1944
00:51:25.380 --> 00:51:27.000
<v Speaker 4>Like people are so like,</v>

1945
00:51:27.001 --> 00:51:30.180
<v Speaker 4>we're so fucking ripped off and fucked in this country right now.</v>

1946
00:51:30.181 --> 00:51:30.630
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1947
00:51:30.630 --> 00:51:34.710
<v Speaker 4>Oh Tony Bennett said something about nine 11 let's have 9,000 new stories about</v>

1948
00:51:34.711 --> 00:51:39.711
<v Speaker 4>that and not about like I and whatever it is might sound like a bit or</v>

1949
00:51:39.871 --> 00:51:40.141
<v Speaker 4>something.</v>

1950
00:51:40.141 --> 00:51:44.880
<v Speaker 4>But like you hear about all this job creation stuff like talking about we're</v>

1951
00:51:44.881 --> 00:51:45.750
<v Speaker 4>going to create jobs,</v>

1952
00:51:45.751 --> 00:51:47.670
<v Speaker 4>but just stop outsourcing them.</v>

1953
00:51:47.671 --> 00:51:48.540
<v Speaker 4>Is that like,</v>

1954
00:51:49.470 --> 00:51:50.580
<v Speaker 4>has anybody said that?</v>

1955
00:51:50.581 --> 00:51:52.710
<v Speaker 4>Is that like a popular belief that</v>

1956
00:51:53.270 --> 00:51:53.451
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1957
00:51:53.451 --> 00:51:53.810
<v Speaker 5>I think,</v>

1958
00:51:53.810 --> 00:51:54.051
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1959
00:51:54.051 --> 00:51:57.830
<v Speaker 5>a lot of people think that the economy will be much better if we stopped doing</v>

1960
00:51:57.831 --> 00:51:58.101
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

1961
00:51:58.101 --> 00:52:00.620
<v Speaker 5>but then I phones would be $7,000</v>

1962
00:52:01.230 --> 00:52:01.741
<v Speaker 4>and all of a sudden,</v>

1963
00:52:01.741 --> 00:52:01.981
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

1964
00:52:01.981 --> 00:52:03.660
<v Speaker 4>maybe everybody doesn't have an iPhone.</v>

1965
00:52:04.460 --> 00:52:08.990
<v Speaker 5>Thank God there's so many places that have been established.</v>

1966
00:52:08.991 --> 00:52:10.730
<v Speaker 5>So many electronics have always been cheap.</v>

1967
00:52:11.570 --> 00:52:12.111
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1968
00:52:12.111 --> 00:52:13.850
<v Speaker 5>Well it's not because we're making them though.</v>

1969
00:52:13.880 --> 00:52:14.713
<v Speaker 5>I don't think tank,</v>

1970
00:52:14.840 --> 00:52:15.021
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1971
00:52:15.021 --> 00:52:16.730
<v Speaker 5>how many electronics do we make over here?</v>

1972
00:52:16.760 --> 00:52:17.870
<v Speaker 5>Barely none.</v>

1973
00:52:17.900 --> 00:52:20.420
<v Speaker 5>But like telemarketing could be done here still.</v>

1974
00:52:21.050 --> 00:52:21.351
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1975
00:52:21.351 --> 00:52:23.180
<v Speaker 5>That's my point.</v>

1976
00:52:23.181 --> 00:52:23.451
<v Speaker 5>Was it,</v>

1977
00:52:23.451 --> 00:52:25.160
<v Speaker 5>I think those people work too hard.</v>

1978
00:52:25.370 --> 00:52:26.810
<v Speaker 5>I think if you looked at those,</v>

1979
00:52:26.811 --> 00:52:26.990
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1980
00:52:26.990 --> 00:52:28.130
<v Speaker 5>what does it Foxconn,</v>

1981
00:52:28.220 --> 00:52:28.491
<v Speaker 5>those,</v>

1982
00:52:28.491 --> 00:52:28.850
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1983
00:52:28.850 --> 00:52:30.680
<v Speaker 5>all those things online about the,</v>

1984
00:52:30.920 --> 00:52:32.660
<v Speaker 5>the people who make those iPhones.</v>

1985
00:52:32.690 --> 00:52:34.280
<v Speaker 5>Like they would never do that here.</v>

1986
00:52:34.550 --> 00:52:36.020
<v Speaker 5>That shit would never get done here,</v>

1987
00:52:36.930 --> 00:52:37.763
<v Speaker 5>would never get done.</v>

1988
00:52:37.820 --> 00:52:38.480
<v Speaker 5>So yeah,</v>

1989
00:52:38.480 --> 00:52:38.600
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

1990
00:52:38.600 --> 00:52:39.433
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1991
00:52:39.470 --> 00:52:39.740
<v Speaker 5>it would,</v>

1992
00:52:39.740 --> 00:52:40.610
<v Speaker 5>it just wouldn't happen.</v>

1993
00:52:41.030 --> 00:52:41.271
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1994
00:52:41.271 --> 00:52:41.451
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1995
00:52:41.451 --> 00:52:42.200
<v Speaker 4>they can have,</v>

1996
00:52:42.200 --> 00:52:44.390
<v Speaker 4>the Asians can keep all the electronic stuff.</v>

1997
00:52:44.391 --> 00:52:45.430
<v Speaker 4>They do a good job of that.</v>

1998
00:52:46.670 --> 00:52:47.370
<v Speaker 4>We'll just do every,</v>

1999
00:52:47.370 --> 00:52:47.780
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2000
00:52:47.780 --> 00:52:51.080
<v Speaker 4>like the sitting in a chair trying to sell people shit over the phone.</v>

2001
00:52:51.940 --> 00:52:53.260
<v Speaker 5>What was the point about why,</v>

2002
00:52:53.261 --> 00:52:56.110
<v Speaker 5>why did we get on the discussion of how much those things cost to make?</v>

2003
00:52:57.510 --> 00:52:58.343
<v Speaker 7>I don't know</v>

2004
00:53:00.550 --> 00:53:00.960
<v Speaker 5>why.</v>

<v Speaker 5>As we know,</v>

2009
00:53:06.430 --> 00:53:07.300
<v Speaker 5>the end is near,</v>

2010
00:53:07.390 --> 00:53:08.410
<v Speaker 5>but I'm turning to you.</v>

2011
00:53:08.920 --> 00:53:12.830
<v Speaker 5>Did you hear about this fucking computer dealers who figured out the uh,</v>

2012
00:53:13.140 --> 00:53:14.280
<v Speaker 4>talking about people?</v>

2013
00:53:14.281 --> 00:53:15.114
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry.</v>

2014

<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2016
00:53:16.150 --> 00:53:16.690
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

2017
00:53:16.690 --> 00:53:17.310
<v Speaker 4>Hold on.</v>

2018
00:53:17.310 --> 00:53:19.470
<v Speaker 4>About people being outraged about,</v>

2019
00:53:19.530 --> 00:53:20.363
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2020
00:53:21.400 --> 00:53:22.900
<v Speaker 5>the met Tracy Morgan.</v>

2021
00:53:22.901 --> 00:53:24.100
<v Speaker 5>People are definitely looking,</v>

2022
00:53:24.101 --> 00:53:24.934
<v Speaker 5>you're right.</v>

2023
00:53:25.170 --> 00:53:25.350
<v Speaker 5>Look,</v>

2024
00:53:25.350 --> 00:53:26.183
<v Speaker 5>you need to be out.</v>

2025
00:53:26.340 --> 00:53:28.290
<v Speaker 4>Have you heard about the Tony Bennett stuff?</v>

2026
00:53:28.291 --> 00:53:29.850
<v Speaker 4>Like when he was on Howard Stern,</v>

2027
00:53:29.851 --> 00:53:31.860
<v Speaker 4>he said something about the singer,</v>

2028
00:53:31.890 --> 00:53:32.723
<v Speaker 4>the singer.</v>

2029
00:53:32.880 --> 00:53:33.660
<v Speaker 4>What'd he say?</v>

2030
00:53:33.660 --> 00:53:35.070
<v Speaker 4>He said something about,</v>

2031
00:53:35.620 --> 00:53:36.453
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2032
00:53:36.510 --> 00:53:37.343
<v Speaker 4>that the,</v>

2033
00:53:38.130 --> 00:53:40.920
<v Speaker 4>the terrorists like nine 11 was kind of like,</v>

2034
00:53:40.921 --> 00:53:42.150
<v Speaker 4>we've been fucking with people.</v>

2035
00:53:42.151 --> 00:53:42.451
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

2036
00:53:42.451 --> 00:53:42.721
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2037
00:53:42.721 --> 00:53:44.190
<v Speaker 4>it was bound to happen sooner or later.</v>

2038
00:53:44.191 --> 00:53:45.810
<v Speaker 4>I don't remember exactly what he said,</v>

2039
00:53:46.020 --> 00:53:46.501
<v Speaker 4>but he was like,</v>

2040
00:53:46.501 --> 00:53:46.681
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2041
00:53:46.681 --> 00:53:47.011
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2042
00:53:47.011 --> 00:53:48.720
<v Speaker 4>we'd done fucked up shit too.</v>

2043
00:53:48.721 --> 00:53:49.520
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

2044
00:53:49.520 --> 00:53:49.970
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2045
00:53:49.970 --> 00:53:51.060
<v Speaker 4>I supposed to say that though.</v>

2046
00:53:51.300 --> 00:53:51.631
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2047
00:53:51.631 --> 00:53:52.381
<v Speaker 4>he got a lot of shit,</v>

2048
00:53:52.381 --> 00:53:53.640
<v Speaker 4>but I think it's overblown,</v>

2049
00:53:53.641 --> 00:53:54.420
<v Speaker 4>which is,</v>

2050
00:53:54.420 --> 00:53:55.253
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2051
00:53:55.530 --> 00:53:56.880
<v Speaker 4>like the Tracy Morgan thing,</v>

2052
00:53:56.881 --> 00:54:01.170
<v Speaker 4>there's just always something with enough buzz words like nine 11 or faggot</v>

2053
00:54:01.650 --> 00:54:04.350
<v Speaker 4>where the news can latch onto that and just keep everybody like,</v>

2054
00:54:04.380 --> 00:54:04.471
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2055
00:54:04.471 --> 00:54:05.191
<v Speaker 4>look over there.</v>

2056
00:54:05.191 --> 00:54:05.491
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2057
00:54:05.491 --> 00:54:07.740
<v Speaker 4>while they're like fucking stealing all their money.</v>

2058
00:54:07.741 --> 00:54:08.574
<v Speaker 4>And</v>

2059
00:54:08.990 --> 00:54:09.590
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

2060
00:54:09.590 --> 00:54:13.280
<v Speaker 5>it's amazing that the other thing that we accept,</v>

2061
00:54:13.310 --> 00:54:15.590
<v Speaker 5>like pretty openly is that in times of war,</v>

2062
00:54:15.800 --> 00:54:20.450
<v Speaker 5>you're not supposed to do anything that's gonna possibly damage the soldiers'</v>

2063
00:54:20.451 --> 00:54:24.410
<v Speaker 5>morale or a upset the way they look at things like,</v>

2064
00:54:24.450 --> 00:54:25.190
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2065
00:54:25.190 --> 00:54:27.440
<v Speaker 5>you're not supposed to say things that would,</v>

2066
00:54:27.441 --> 00:54:27.980
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2067
00:54:27.980 --> 00:54:28.580
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2068
00:54:28.580 --> 00:54:29.750
<v Speaker 5>possibly upset them.</v>

2069
00:54:30.170 --> 00:54:31.003
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2070
00:54:31.190 --> 00:54:31.690
<v Speaker 5>it's kind of,</v>

2071
00:54:31.690 --> 00:54:32.060
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

2072
00:54:32.060 --> 00:54:32.630
<v Speaker 5>which,</v>

2073
00:54:32.630 --> 00:54:32.961
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2074
00:54:32.961 --> 00:54:33.771
<v Speaker 5>totally makes sense,</v>

2075
00:54:33.771 --> 00:54:35.780
<v Speaker 5>but when you stop and think about it,</v>

2076
00:54:35.781 --> 00:54:37.640
<v Speaker 5>like what are you asking them to do?</v>

2077
00:54:38.210 --> 00:54:38.390
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2078
00:54:38.390 --> 00:54:39.990
<v Speaker 4>That should I do already in the ward,</v>

2079
00:54:40.450 --> 00:54:40.790
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2080
00:54:40.790 --> 00:54:42.380
<v Speaker 4>don't you think they're figuring it out by now?</v>

2081
00:54:42.381 --> 00:54:42.531
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

2082
00:54:42.531 --> 00:54:42.951
<v Speaker 4>wait a minute,</v>

2083
00:54:42.951 --> 00:54:44.870
<v Speaker 4>this is fucking bullshit going on.</v>

2084
00:54:45.170 --> 00:54:45.710
<v Speaker 5>Do you think,</v>

2085
00:54:45.710 --> 00:54:45.930
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2086
00:54:45.930 --> 00:54:46.190
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2087
00:54:46.190 --> 00:54:49.310
<v Speaker 5>some people can keep it together so people look,</v>

2088
00:54:49.311 --> 00:54:50.480
<v Speaker 5>people are meant to do everything.</v>

2089
00:54:50.481 --> 00:54:52.100
<v Speaker 5>Then there's people that are meant to do that.</v>

2090
00:54:52.280 --> 00:54:53.420
<v Speaker 5>It sounds ridiculous,</v>

2091
00:54:53.810 --> 00:54:54.920
<v Speaker 5>but I firmly believe it.</v>

2092
00:54:54.950 --> 00:54:57.560
<v Speaker 5>I think there's a broad spectrum of human beings in this world.</v>

2093
00:54:58.170 --> 00:54:58.471
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2094
00:54:58.471 --> 00:54:58.780
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2095
00:54:58.780 --> 00:54:58.950
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

2096
00:54:58.950 --> 00:55:00.570
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to bring anybody's more out down.</v>

2097
00:55:01.380 --> 00:55:02.130
<v Speaker 4>Why,</v>

2098
00:55:02.130 --> 00:55:02.963
<v Speaker 4>why would you,</v>

2099
00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:04.270
<v Speaker 5>I think narrowing,</v>

2100
00:55:05.480 --> 00:55:06.313
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2101
00:55:06.440 --> 00:55:08.860
<v Speaker 5>do you ever think about joining the military at any point in your life?</v>

2102
00:55:09.720 --> 00:55:10.440
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2103
00:55:10.440 --> 00:55:11.280
<v Speaker 4>not at all.</v>

2104
00:55:12.450 --> 00:55:14.780
<v Speaker 4>I've always had a problem with like authorities.</v>

2105
00:55:15.560 --> 00:55:16.071
<v Speaker 5>I did too,</v>

2106
00:55:16.071 --> 00:55:18.110
<v Speaker 5>but I also thought that I needed discipline,</v>

2107
00:55:18.330 --> 00:55:18.680
<v Speaker 5>whatever.</v>

2108
00:55:18.680 --> 00:55:21.200
<v Speaker 5>That's when I was 18 I almost joined thought about it.</v>

2109
00:55:21.260 --> 00:55:22.460
<v Speaker 5>I wouldn't say almost join,</v>

2110
00:55:22.461 --> 00:55:25.640
<v Speaker 5>but I thought about it like as a strong possibility for a couple of days,</v>

2111
00:55:26.030 --> 00:55:30.200
<v Speaker 5>which to me at 18 was with my fucking heavy add was a big deal.</v>

2112
00:55:30.260 --> 00:55:31.640
<v Speaker 5>I think it would have done me good.</v>

2113
00:55:31.641 --> 00:55:32.120
<v Speaker 5>But yeah,</v>

2114
00:55:32.120 --> 00:55:34.730
<v Speaker 5>I wouldn't have why always admired people that did it.</v>

2115
00:55:34.790 --> 00:55:37.970
<v Speaker 5>I had a few friends that were in the army and I have a few friends that had been</v>

2116
00:55:37.971 --> 00:55:39.770
<v Speaker 5>in the marines and they definitely,</v>

2117
00:55:39.771 --> 00:55:41.570
<v Speaker 5>it came back like more,</v>

2118
00:55:41.630 --> 00:55:42.800
<v Speaker 5>there was something about them,</v>

2119
00:55:42.801 --> 00:55:43.041
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2120
00:55:43.041 --> 00:55:44.720
<v Speaker 5>they had more confidence,</v>

2121
00:55:44.721 --> 00:55:44.961
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2122
00:55:44.961 --> 00:55:47.300
<v Speaker 5>they had like been through bootcamp and all that shit and they,</v>

2123
00:55:47.301 --> 00:55:51.320
<v Speaker 5>there was a passage or coming of age sort of a thing that I hadn't experienced</v>

2124
00:55:51.690 --> 00:55:52.131
<v Speaker 5>and I was like,</v>

2125
00:55:52.131 --> 00:55:53.420
<v Speaker 5>I think there's something to that.</v>

2126
00:55:53.421 --> 00:55:53.721
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2127
00:55:53.721 --> 00:55:55.670
<v Speaker 5>I think like boot is good for somebody.</v>

2128
00:55:56.580 --> 00:56:00.710
<v Speaker 5>I was always trying to figure out what's the best way to think,</v>

2129
00:56:00.711 --> 00:56:03.650
<v Speaker 5>what's the best way to maneuver your way through life?</v>

2130
00:56:03.651 --> 00:56:03.981
<v Speaker 5>What is it?</v>

2131
00:56:03.981 --> 00:56:06.320
<v Speaker 5>And I was the thing that I was most uncomfortable with,</v>

2132
00:56:06.340 --> 00:56:06.621
<v Speaker 5>so I'm like,</v>

2133
00:56:06.621 --> 00:56:07.520
<v Speaker 5>I'm fucking Lazy,</v>

2134
00:56:07.521 --> 00:56:07.910
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

2135
00:56:07.910 --> 00:56:08.810
<v Speaker 5>I don't like this.</v>
