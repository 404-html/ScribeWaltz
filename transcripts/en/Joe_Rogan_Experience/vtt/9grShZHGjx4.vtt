00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.890
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches.</v>

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:10.060
<v Speaker 1>it's ways of adjusting to life.</v>

6
00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:12.160
<v Speaker 1>My friend and dress Antonopoulos,</v>

7
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:12.500
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

8
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:12.840
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

9
00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:13.241
<v Speaker 1>my friend,</v>

10
00:00:13.241 --> 00:00:16.060
<v Speaker 1>the bitcoin expert explained this to me last weekend in Vegas.</v>

11
00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:21.390
<v Speaker 1>Ducks have three foot long dicks that curl and twist because the female vaginas</v>

12
00:00:26.291 --> 00:00:29.320
<v Speaker 1>have adapted to fight off rape.</v>

13
00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:30.490
<v Speaker 1>Duck rape.</v>

14
00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:30.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

15
00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:33.020
<v Speaker 1>So they have these pussies that are the,</v>

16
00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.670
<v Speaker 1>these fucking laboratories,</v>

17
00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:36.760
<v Speaker 1>these twisty turny,</v>

18
00:00:36.761 --> 00:00:41.761
<v Speaker 1>elaborative pussies and they can choose to let sperm in,</v>

19
00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.640
<v Speaker 1>are not let sperm in with their gigantic labyrinth,</v>

20
00:00:45.641 --> 00:00:48.880
<v Speaker 1>pussies and these three foot long duck dicks.</v>

21
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.690
<v Speaker 1>When you see a duck's deck you like,</v>

22
00:00:50.691 --> 00:00:50.920
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

23
00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.180
<v Speaker 1>that is not real.</v>

24
00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:53.500
<v Speaker 1>Look at that ducks deck.</v>

25
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:54.933
<v Speaker 1>That's a drawing.</v>

26
00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:56.230
<v Speaker 1>That's a drawing.</v>

27
00:00:56.231 --> 00:00:57.700
<v Speaker 1>But there's actual photograph.</v>

28
00:00:57.701 --> 00:00:59.260
<v Speaker 1>That's an actual photograph of a duct.</v>

29
00:00:59.261 --> 00:00:59.650
<v Speaker 1>Dick.</v>

30
00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:01.030
<v Speaker 1>What in the fuck?</v>

31
00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.510
<v Speaker 1>That's like a person but like a 15 foot long dick.</v>

32
00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:04.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

33
00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:06.840
<v Speaker 1>Ducks are tiny man horse trailer deck.</v>

34
00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.310
<v Speaker 1>Like a person with a three foot dick is a monster.</v>

35
00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:12.730
<v Speaker 1>But a duck with a three foot long dick is totally standard.</v>

36
00:01:12.731 --> 00:01:14.010
<v Speaker 1>That's a deck that's a Olympian.</v>

37
00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:15.161
<v Speaker 1>That's guy's a little,</v>

38
00:01:15.161 --> 00:01:15.581
<v Speaker 1>a little deck.</v>

39
00:01:15.581 --> 00:01:17.050
<v Speaker 1>He gets shamed by the other ducks.</v>

40
00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:18.010
<v Speaker 1>Poor guy.</v>

41
00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.281
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

42
00:01:18.281 --> 00:01:20.290
<v Speaker 1>I mean duct dicks are ridiculous.</v>

43
00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:21.040
<v Speaker 1>They're,</v>

44
00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:22.690
<v Speaker 1>it's a fucking ridiculous animal.</v>

45
00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.260
<v Speaker 1>What docs,</v>

46
00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.400
<v Speaker 1>I knew the ducks engaged in rape,</v>

47
00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:28.270
<v Speaker 1>gang rape.</v>

48
00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.361
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

49
00:01:28.361 --> 00:01:29.194
<v Speaker 1>that's all they do.</v>

50
00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:30.970
<v Speaker 1>The ceiling gang up on one.</v>

51
00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.600
<v Speaker 1>Look out.</v>

52
00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:32.510
<v Speaker 1>Look how the,</v>

53
00:01:32.511 --> 00:01:37.511
<v Speaker 1>the female's vagina has sort of adapted to deal with the male raping,</v>

54
00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:40.301
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

55
00:01:40.301 --> 00:01:43.420
<v Speaker 1>created these bizarre pathways in their pussies.</v>

56
00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:44.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

57
00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:44.401
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

58
00:01:44.401 --> 00:01:45.071
<v Speaker 2>a mighty mouse is,</v>

59
00:01:45.071 --> 00:01:45.601
<v Speaker 2>he's a,</v>

60
00:01:45.601 --> 00:01:46.220
<v Speaker 2>he's interesting.</v>

61
00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.050
<v Speaker 2>I know you've been a big fan of him and I've always enjoyed watching that guy.</v>

62
00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.340
<v Speaker 2>I mean I can't fight like that guy,</v>

63
00:01:50.341 --> 00:01:54.060
<v Speaker 2>but to watch some of his techniques and the way you use angles and footwork and</v>

64
00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.770
<v Speaker 2>how he lures you in and his clinch game is,</v>

65
00:01:56.771 --> 00:01:57.604
<v Speaker 2>is uh,</v>

66
00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:58.493
<v Speaker 1>is nasty.</v>

67
00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.903
<v Speaker 1>Just nasty.</v>

68
00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.450
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

69
00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.871
<v Speaker 1>I wonder,</v>

70
00:02:00.871 --> 00:02:03.030
<v Speaker 1>and maybe you could give some insight on this.</v>

71
00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.080
<v Speaker 1>Like you used to fight at one 55 and now you've got to cut to get down to one 45</v>

72
00:02:07.081 --> 00:02:07.171
<v Speaker 1>year.</v>

73
00:02:07.171 --> 00:02:08.004
<v Speaker 1>A pretty big guy.</v>

74
00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.920
<v Speaker 1>But mighty mouse is not a big guy.</v>

75
00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:12.210
<v Speaker 1>And I always wonder like,</v>

76
00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.530
<v Speaker 1>could a guy like good a light heavyweight or a middleweight even,</v>

77
00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.190
<v Speaker 1>could they possibly even fight like him or is that a gravity thing?</v>

78
00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.811
<v Speaker 1>Like is it,</v>

79
00:02:20.811 --> 00:02:22.650
<v Speaker 1>is part of what's going on with him?</v>

80
00:02:22.651 --> 00:02:23.970
<v Speaker 1>The fact that he's so light,</v>

81
00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.100
<v Speaker 1>like he can move faster,</v>

82
00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.160
<v Speaker 1>he's got like more options as far as like what he can do.</v>

83
00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:33.800
<v Speaker 2>Some people were a blessed with a better integrated and their body such as like</v>

84
00:02:33.801 --> 00:02:34.700
<v Speaker 2>a neutral spine.</v>

85
00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.010
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people have like lumbar problems in neutral spine.</v>

86
00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:38.390
<v Speaker 2>You ever watch Mayweather?</v>

87
00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.991
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

88
00:02:38.991 --> 00:02:42.800
<v Speaker 2>you don't ever see them lean and he's just always in constantly good posture and</v>

89
00:02:42.801 --> 00:02:43.634
<v Speaker 2>good position.</v>

90
00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:44.840
<v Speaker 2>And just like in wrestling,</v>

91
00:02:44.841 --> 00:02:45.920
<v Speaker 2>if you're in good position,</v>

92
00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:47.270
<v Speaker 2>more than likely you're gonna win the fight.</v>

93
00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:48.351
<v Speaker 2>Mighty mouse,</v>

94
00:02:48.351 --> 00:02:50.870
<v Speaker 2>he just has that type of movement and integrates his whole body.</v>

95
00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:52.340
<v Speaker 2>His body moves as one,</v>

96
00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:53.600
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't work against them.</v>

97
00:02:53.601 --> 00:02:55.670
<v Speaker 2>There's not like a lot of rattle in his body safe.</v>

98
00:02:55.671 --> 00:02:56.504
<v Speaker 2>He throws a kick,</v>

99
00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:57.860
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't land awkward.</v>

100
00:02:57.861 --> 00:02:58.310
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't,</v>

101
00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.570
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

102
00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:59.050
<v Speaker 2>it goes,</v>

103
00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:03.610
<v Speaker 2>he goes right back to a neutral base and he's able to laterally move and</v>

104
00:03:03.611 --> 00:03:05.380
<v Speaker 2>constantly have his body working for him.</v>

105
00:03:05.381 --> 00:03:07.030
<v Speaker 2>So I think him naturally,</v>

106
00:03:07.031 --> 00:03:10.510
<v Speaker 2>he just has that type of gifts and benefits of his body's able to integrate his</v>

107
00:03:10.511 --> 00:03:11.680
<v Speaker 2>body to work as one.</v>

108
00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.741
<v Speaker 2>Therefore you,</v>

109
00:03:12.741 --> 00:03:15.310
<v Speaker 2>you don't waste a lot of energy has really fluid movement.</v>

110
00:03:15.311 --> 00:03:15.671
<v Speaker 2>Look at,</v>

111
00:03:15.671 --> 00:03:16.160
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

112
00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.160
<v Speaker 2>a guy like Anderson Silva.</v>

113
00:03:18.161 --> 00:03:21.110
<v Speaker 2>He's able to beat people just by keeping his range and it,</v>

114
00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.600
<v Speaker 2>and just his movement of his body.</v>

115
00:03:22.601 --> 00:03:23.080
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't,</v>

116
00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.910
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't swing like a Mark Hunt or,</v>

117
00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.050
<v Speaker 2>or me where,</v>

118
00:03:26.051 --> 00:03:26.231
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

119
00:03:26.231 --> 00:03:26.651
<v Speaker 2>like I'll,</v>

120
00:03:26.651 --> 00:03:28.930
<v Speaker 2>I'll throw a lot of powers and normally I miss,</v>

121
00:03:28.931 --> 00:03:29.111
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

122
00:03:29.111 --> 00:03:29.920
<v Speaker 2>I'm just trying to,</v>

123
00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:30.491
<v Speaker 2>trying to reach them,</v>

124
00:03:30.491 --> 00:03:31.031
<v Speaker 2>but them guys,</v>

125
00:03:31.031 --> 00:03:32.890
<v Speaker 2>they just use fluid movement and that's,</v>

126
00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.760
<v Speaker 2>I think some people are just blessed to have that integrated in their body in a</v>

127
00:03:36.761 --> 00:03:39.010
<v Speaker 2>good neutral spine and a good solid base.</v>

128
00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.380
<v Speaker 2>And that's why they're able to connect on their shots a lot more.</v>

129
00:03:41.381 --> 00:03:42.340
<v Speaker 2>It's as competing,</v>

130
00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:43.001
<v Speaker 2>disconnected,</v>

131
00:03:43.001 --> 00:03:43.151
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

132
00:03:43.151 --> 00:03:43.660
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

133
00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:44.800
<v Speaker 2>say like a short circuit.</v>

134
00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.451
<v Speaker 2>If it,</v>

135
00:03:45.451 --> 00:03:46.510
<v Speaker 2>if there's like a small,</v>

136
00:03:46.511 --> 00:03:47.800
<v Speaker 2>like little detail,</v>

137
00:03:47.801 --> 00:03:48.640
<v Speaker 2>like this cord right here,</v>

138
00:03:48.641 --> 00:03:49.181
<v Speaker 2>say it's like,</v>

139
00:03:49.181 --> 00:03:52.210
<v Speaker 2>it's like broken and you're not getting like the full amount of energy as where</v>

140
00:03:52.211 --> 00:03:54.820
<v Speaker 2>if you have a solid base and a good good spine,</v>

141
00:03:54.821 --> 00:03:56.650
<v Speaker 2>you know how to integrate your body to use as one,</v>

142
00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:00.220
<v Speaker 2>there's gonna be a lot more of a sturdier connection and more flow and fluid</v>

143
00:04:00.221 --> 00:04:00.630
<v Speaker 2>movement.</v>

144
00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:00.791
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

145
00:04:00.791 --> 00:04:01.210
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

146
00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:01.511
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

147
00:04:01.511 --> 00:04:02.080
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

148
00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:03.370
<v Speaker 3>it was tough doing the talk.</v>

149
00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:04.331
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>

150
00:04:04.331 --> 00:04:04.690
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

151
00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:06.040
<v Speaker 3>whenever I got into Congo,</v>

152
00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.210
<v Speaker 3>they told me I had the flu in London and the doctors there and that's what I</v>

153
00:04:10.211 --> 00:04:11.410
<v Speaker 3>feel like here to,</v>

154
00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.400
<v Speaker 3>there can be tropical medical medicine specialist here and they're probably</v>

155
00:04:15.401 --> 00:04:15.851
<v Speaker 3>really great.</v>

156
00:04:15.851 --> 00:04:16.684
<v Speaker 3>But I,</v>

157
00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:20.080
<v Speaker 3>I would trust the doctor that's lived in the climate of the tropical climate</v>

158
00:04:20.081 --> 00:04:21.160
<v Speaker 3>around malaria that seen it.</v>

159
00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:21.850
<v Speaker 3>That's true.</v>

160
00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:22.990
<v Speaker 3>That knows all the symptoms,</v>

161
00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:25.540
<v Speaker 3>well knows to look for it because no one gets it over here.</v>

162
00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:25.871
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

163
00:04:25.871 --> 00:04:27.340
<v Speaker 3>And so whenever I got into Congo,</v>

164
00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:28.510
<v Speaker 3>I flew from,</v>

165
00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:29.201
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

166
00:04:29.201 --> 00:04:31.420
<v Speaker 3>From work to Congo.</v>

167
00:04:31.421 --> 00:04:32.380
<v Speaker 3>And whenever I landed,</v>

168
00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.000
<v Speaker 3>instead of going straight to the forest,</v>

169
00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.730
<v Speaker 3>they took me to like a air strip at a,</v>

170
00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:37.300
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

171
00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:38.710
<v Speaker 3>kind of hospital in the middle of nowhere.</v>

172
00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:39.521
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

173
00:04:39.521 --> 00:04:40.354
<v Speaker 3>so I landed,</v>

174
00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:42.970
<v Speaker 3>went straight to the hospital and then right there they're like,</v>

175
00:04:42.971 --> 00:04:43.601
<v Speaker 3>you don't have the flu,</v>

176
00:04:43.601 --> 00:04:44.410
<v Speaker 3>you have malaria.</v>

177
00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:44.801
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>

178
00:04:44.801 --> 00:04:45.250
<v Speaker 3>but I,</v>

179
00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:46.083
<v Speaker 3>I've been,</v>

180
00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:47.500
<v Speaker 3>I've been in the states,</v>

181
00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:49.000
<v Speaker 3>I just fought and then I have,</v>

182
00:04:49.001 --> 00:04:49.750
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

183
00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:51.040
<v Speaker 3>and then I was in Europe.</v>

184
00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:52.090
<v Speaker 3>Like there's no,</v>

185
00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:53.200
<v Speaker 3>no malaria really there,</v>

186
00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.510
<v Speaker 3>but it was because it's still living inside me.</v>

187
00:04:55.511 --> 00:04:56.021
<v Speaker 3>There's like,</v>

188
00:04:56.021 --> 00:04:56.500
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

189
00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:57.490
<v Speaker 3>I think there's three strands.</v>

190
00:04:57.491 --> 00:04:58.750
<v Speaker 3>One live in your body for three years,</v>

191
00:04:58.751 --> 00:04:59.584
<v Speaker 3>five years.</v>

192
00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.800
<v Speaker 3>I think the other is like 30 to life or something.</v>

193
00:05:01.801 --> 00:05:02.634
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

194
00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:03.130
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

195
00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:03.660
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

196
00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:04.840
<v Speaker 3>so it just comes back.</v>

197
00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:05.070
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

198
00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:07.360
<v Speaker 3>Can like when your body's really rundown,</v>

199
00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:08.410
<v Speaker 3>when you're really tired,</v>

200
00:05:08.411 --> 00:05:11.140
<v Speaker 3>immune systems low like training for a fight.</v>

201
00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:11.740
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

202
00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:13.510
<v Speaker 3>Like training for a fight or right after the fight,</v>

203
00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:14.591
<v Speaker 3>right off the fight,</v>

204
00:05:14.591 --> 00:05:15.580
<v Speaker 3>went to London and spoke,</v>

205
00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:16.540
<v Speaker 3>then I went to Congo.</v>

206
00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:18.550
<v Speaker 3>But right after the fight.</v>

207
00:05:18.551 --> 00:05:20.920
<v Speaker 3>So you recovering from malaria,</v>

208
00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:22.750
<v Speaker 3>you go through your six week fight camp,</v>

209
00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:23.830
<v Speaker 3>you have your fight,</v>

210
00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:25.000
<v Speaker 3>you're run down.</v>

211
00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:26.770
<v Speaker 3>And then after the fight you got malaria again.</v>

212
00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:27.690
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

213
00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:27.970
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

214
00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:29.560
<v Speaker 3>now those sickness.</v>

215
00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:30.320
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

216
00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:30.540
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

217
00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:32.410
<v Speaker 3>I've had it now three times.</v>

218
00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:33.251
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

219
00:05:33.251 --> 00:05:34.840
<v Speaker 3>So at least confirm twice.</v>

220
00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:36.250
<v Speaker 3>The third time they're like,</v>

221
00:05:36.251 --> 00:05:36.431
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

222
00:05:36.431 --> 00:05:37.091
<v Speaker 3>you have it for sure.</v>

223
00:05:37.091 --> 00:05:37.924
<v Speaker 3>But the,</v>

224
00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:41.620
<v Speaker 3>with malaria you have to get the test,</v>

225
00:05:41.621 --> 00:05:45.550
<v Speaker 3>the blood test while you have a certain degree temperature like fever,</v>

226
00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:45.971
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

227
00:05:45.971 --> 00:05:47.530
<v Speaker 3>whenever it's cycling out of your liver,</v>

228
00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:48.653
<v Speaker 3>I mean coming out.</v>

229
00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:49.000
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

230
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.700
<v Speaker 3>they have to draw the blood at that exact time to get it.</v>

231
00:05:51.701 --> 00:05:55.030
<v Speaker 3>And so that's why I was misdiagnosed four times in the Congo.</v>

232
00:05:55.031 --> 00:05:56.170
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

233
00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:57.830
<v Speaker 3>what a sneaky fucking disease.</v>

234
00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:58.041
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

235
00:05:58.041 --> 00:05:58.401
<v Speaker 3>it's nuts.</v>

236
00:05:58.401 --> 00:05:59.151
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>

237
00:05:59.151 --> 00:05:59.900
<v Speaker 3>Cause they'll,</v>

238
00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:02.630
<v Speaker 3>they'll hide in your liver and then they send them out in your bloodstream like</v>

239
00:06:02.631 --> 00:06:02.870
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

240
00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:03.800
<v Speaker 3>like a platoon.</v>

241
00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:07.130
<v Speaker 3>They go and wreck havoc and then they retreat right back to the liver.</v>

242
00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:07.611
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

243
00:06:07.611 --> 00:06:08.000
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

244
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.350
<v Speaker 3>They live in your liver?</v>

245
00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:09.621
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

246
00:06:09.621 --> 00:06:13.100
<v Speaker 3>That's where they're hiding away for three or five or 30 years.</v>

247
00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:14.240
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

248
00:06:14.241 --> 00:06:14.960
<v Speaker 3>And what does,</v>

249
00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:16.070
<v Speaker 3>is there any solution?</v>

250
00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:17.300
<v Speaker 3>Is there anything they could do?</v>

251
00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:17.960
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

252
00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:18.793
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so.</v>

253
00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:21.440
<v Speaker 3>And I had a couple things that happened where,</v>

254
00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:22.663
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

255
00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:23.031
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

256
00:06:23.031 --> 00:06:23.111
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

257
00:06:23.111 --> 00:06:26.390
<v Speaker 3>I started trying to take the anti malaria meds but I started getting,</v>

258
00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:29.840
<v Speaker 3>it's the only medicine I've ever really reacted to where getting nauseous start</v>

259
00:06:29.841 --> 00:06:30.561
<v Speaker 3>dragging him heard.</v>

260
00:06:30.561 --> 00:06:31.270
<v Speaker 3>It's awful.</v>

261
00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:31.550
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

262
00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:32.383
<v Speaker 3>Even uh,</v>

263
00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:33.223
<v Speaker 3>even um,</v>

264
00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:36.830
<v Speaker 3>oh I'm pasty white and I get real sun sensitive.</v>

265
00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:37.460
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

266
00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:40.070
<v Speaker 3>I know another medicine called method when um,</v>

267
00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:40.933
<v Speaker 3>which is uh,</v>

268
00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:43.550
<v Speaker 3>I think it's developed in Switzerland or Sweden,</v>

269
00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:46.310
<v Speaker 3>supposed to be an awesome new malaria medicine.</v>

270
00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:48.890
<v Speaker 3>It's actually the one thing my body kind of responds to.</v>

271
00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:50.143
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>

272
00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:52.420
<v Speaker 3>but it's actually really dangerous because a,</v>

273
00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:55.970
<v Speaker 3>I've seen people that are there for aid work and different stuff and do they</v>

274
00:06:55.971 --> 00:06:56.570
<v Speaker 3>have to,</v>

275
00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:58.850
<v Speaker 3>they have to retreat if they're there with kids and stuff,</v>

276
00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:01.340
<v Speaker 3>they moved there to the country they're taking off.</v>

277
00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:06.340
<v Speaker 3>Cause I'm cause Kiddos or even adults have mental breaks that they can't come</v>

278
00:07:06.861 --> 00:07:07.281
<v Speaker 3>back from.</v>

279
00:07:07.281 --> 00:07:09.260
<v Speaker 3>Like you can have psychotic episodes for,</v>

280
00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:11.900
<v Speaker 3>I think they said like if it lasts longer than a week,</v>

281
00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:15.500
<v Speaker 3>it's probably in the last like three months to last longer than three months.</v>

282
00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:16.520
<v Speaker 3>It's probably the last forever.</v>

283
00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:17.673
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

284
00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:18.441
<v Speaker 3>So I'm,</v>

285
00:07:18.441 --> 00:07:19.820
<v Speaker 3>so this is from the medication?</v>

286
00:07:19.821 --> 00:07:19.980
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

287
00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:21.920
<v Speaker 3>Just the medication and it gives you terrible,</v>

288
00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:23.270
<v Speaker 3>terrible nightmares.</v>

289
00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:26.210
<v Speaker 3>I almost went to Tanzania this summer.</v>

290
00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:30.620
<v Speaker 3>What was going to go on safari and too many people scare the shit out of me with</v>

291
00:07:30.621 --> 00:07:31.460
<v Speaker 3>malaria talk.</v>

292
00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:32.390
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

293
00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:33.800
<v Speaker 3>I was going to take my whole family and I'm like,</v>

294
00:07:33.801 --> 00:07:33.981
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

295
00:07:33.981 --> 00:07:34.820
<v Speaker 3>I'll take some malaria,</v>

296
00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:36.380
<v Speaker 3>malaria medication and feel like shit.</v>

297
00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:37.850
<v Speaker 3>I'm not giving it to my six year old.</v>

298
00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:38.320
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

299
00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:38.720
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>

300
00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:39.530
<v Speaker 3>it's not happening.</v>

301
00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:40.160
<v Speaker 3>That would be,</v>

302
00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:41.690
<v Speaker 3>I'm not doing enough when you yeah,</v>

303
00:07:41.691 --> 00:07:43.370
<v Speaker 3>but that's a real concern.</v>

304
00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:43.641
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

305
00:07:43.641 --> 00:07:45.020
<v Speaker 3>Tanzania has malaria as well,</v>

306
00:07:45.021 --> 00:07:45.530
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

307
00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:45.711
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

308
00:07:45.711 --> 00:07:46.041
<v Speaker 3>they do.</v>

309
00:07:46.041 --> 00:07:48.680
<v Speaker 3>It's it because it's more of a,</v>

310
00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:50.540
<v Speaker 3>was that arid climate more?</v>

311
00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:51.973
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

312
00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:53.120
<v Speaker 3>they have less there.</v>

313
00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:54.680
<v Speaker 3>It's not so tropical there.</v>

314
00:07:54.681 --> 00:07:57.500
<v Speaker 3>I've been to Tanzania a couple of times and Sam's a bar.</v>

315
00:07:57.501 --> 00:07:57.741
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

316
00:07:57.741 --> 00:07:58.101
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>

317
00:07:58.101 --> 00:07:58.934
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

318
00:07:58.940 --> 00:07:59.100
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

319
00:07:59.100 --> 00:07:59.721
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't there,</v>

320
00:07:59.721 --> 00:08:01.630
<v Speaker 3>but I was saw it and it was a,</v>

321
00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:03.081
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

322
00:08:03.081 --> 00:08:03.501
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's,</v>

323
00:08:03.501 --> 00:08:04.460
<v Speaker 3>it's a crazy,</v>

324
00:08:04.461 --> 00:08:08.720
<v Speaker 3>crazy place because you go from Congo where they have all these tropical</v>

325
00:08:08.721 --> 00:08:10.100
<v Speaker 3>diseases and you go,</v>

326
00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:10.740
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

327
00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:11.421
<v Speaker 3>the same continent.</v>

328
00:08:11.421 --> 00:08:12.231
<v Speaker 3>You just go over a little bit.</v>

329
00:08:12.231 --> 00:08:13.580
<v Speaker 3>And there's all these other kinds of parasites.</v>

330
00:08:13.581 --> 00:08:14.750
<v Speaker 3>Like in Congo,</v>

331
00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:16.340
<v Speaker 3>they have very little of a,</v>

332
00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:18.310
<v Speaker 3>I believe they're cold.</v>

333
00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:19.280
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

334
00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:22.130
<v Speaker 3>jiggers with a j and m it said chicken.</v>

335
00:08:22.131 --> 00:08:23.760
<v Speaker 3>It's very careful when you say that word,</v>

336
00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:27.600
<v Speaker 3>but jiggers with a j he's wrong.</v>

337
00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:29.000
<v Speaker 3>It sounds like you should stop.</v>

338
00:08:31.130 --> 00:08:31.631
<v Speaker 3>But they,</v>

339
00:08:31.631 --> 00:08:32.370
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

340
00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:37.370
<v Speaker 3>they're these crazy parasites at burrow in your feet and especially kids and</v>

341
00:08:38.001 --> 00:08:38.834
<v Speaker 3>elderly.</v>

342
00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:39.410

00:08:43.551 --> 00:08:44.900
<v Speaker 3>I think one reason with poverty,</v>

348
00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:45.410
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

349
00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:48.770

350
00:08:48.771 --> 00:08:49.640
<v Speaker 3>the elderly,</v>

351
00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:51.710
<v Speaker 3>if they're not able to work and provide for themselves.</v>

352
00:08:51.711 --> 00:08:52.670
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

353
00:08:52.671 --> 00:08:53.720
<v Speaker 3>it's harder for them to,</v>

354
00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:54.360
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

355

<v Speaker 3>but also it's just the,</v>

357
00:08:56.791 --> 00:08:57.600
<v Speaker 3>where they live.</v>

358

00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:19.350
<v Speaker 3>it's painful.</v>

373
00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:20.880
<v Speaker 3>Whenever I've seen people getting it done,</v>

<v Speaker 3>you're literally putting there,</v>

388
00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:42.360
<v Speaker 3>the grimacing,</v>

389
00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:43.830
<v Speaker 3>when you're taking it out there screaming,</v>

390
00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:46.800
<v Speaker 3>God damn Africa</v>

391
