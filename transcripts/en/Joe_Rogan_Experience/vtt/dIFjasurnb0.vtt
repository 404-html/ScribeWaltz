<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4
00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.130
<v Speaker 1>it looks weird if it's only one headset.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are we live?</v>

5
00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:13.110
<v Speaker 1>We fucking live,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

6
00:00:13.111 --> 00:00:15.180
<v Speaker 1>What's going on brother?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chelan look at you.</v>

7
00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.720
<v Speaker 1>Look at me filling out the tanks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Budweiser.</v>

8
00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:18.773
<v Speaker 1>Cheers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got it.</v>

9
00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.920
<v Speaker 1>We cannot have a podcast with cowboy </v>
<v Speaker 1>without America.</v>

10
00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:24.450
<v Speaker 1>America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>America,</v>

11
00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:25.590
<v Speaker 1>America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

12
00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.040
<v Speaker 1>So not have a good one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

13
00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.650
<v Speaker 1>So tell me about the tanks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He sent me a picture today,</v>

14
00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:33.583
<v Speaker 1>gail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't I?</v>

15
00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you doing?</v>

16
00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:37.950
<v Speaker 1>And go and dive into Catalina.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>

17
00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.710
<v Speaker 1>Home with the home of the sharks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Makos right?</v>

18
00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:41.603
<v Speaker 1>The MAACO.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

19
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:42.473
<v Speaker 1>I was watching a TV show the other day </v>
<v Speaker 1>where people are fishing for them out </v>

20
00:00:44.251 --> 00:00:46.650
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we got a filled up,</v>

21
00:00:46.651 --> 00:00:47.484
<v Speaker 1>a couple of doubles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My buddy rob from always sunny in </v>

22
00:00:49.951 --> 00:00:52.170
<v Speaker 1>Philadelphia taking me this weekend </v>
<v Speaker 1>camping.</v>

23
00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.570
<v Speaker 1>So they're going to die,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they all die of singles.</v>

24
00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:57.660
<v Speaker 1>So I like to go deeper longer with </v>
<v Speaker 1>singles.</v>

25
00:00:57.661 --> 00:00:58.950
<v Speaker 1>Wasn't going to single tank.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Got Aluminum.</v>

26
00:00:58.951 --> 00:01:00.530
<v Speaker 1>80 Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>single tank.</v>

27
00:01:00.531 --> 00:01:01.141
<v Speaker 1>The tank.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

28
00:01:01.141 --> 00:01:05.910
<v Speaker 1>So me and my girl or dive in doubles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which everyone says doubled means double</v>

29
00:01:05.911 --> 00:01:06.870
<v Speaker 1>trouble,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but whatever.</v>

30
00:01:06.871 --> 00:01:07.704
<v Speaker 1>So what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how deep can you go with the </v>

31
00:01:09.241 --> 00:01:09.731
<v Speaker 1>double?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

32
00:01:09.731 --> 00:01:11.550
<v Speaker 1>you can go as deep until you run out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>air,</v>

33
00:01:11.551 --> 00:01:16.350
<v Speaker 1>but we'll probably go and the 200 range,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two 20 to 200 feet down,</v>

34
00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.213
<v Speaker 1>200 feet down and home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one of those weird ones where </v>

35
00:01:19.951 --> 00:01:21.540
<v Speaker 1>when you come up you got to come up </v>
<v Speaker 1>slow.</v>

36
00:01:21.541 --> 00:01:23.310
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She didn't get the Benz.</v>

37
00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:24.193
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

38
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.450
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

39
00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.360
<v Speaker 1>you get the bends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

40
00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.850
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>decompress and you know,</v>

41
00:01:29.851 --> 00:01:30.684
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the process did to diving in and I've </v>

42
00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:34.283
<v Speaker 1>been diving series,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like a lot of wreck diving and a </v>

43
00:01:36.601 --> 00:01:37.434
<v Speaker 1>lot of like tech,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should say diving over the last two </v>

44
00:01:39.181 --> 00:01:39.601
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

45
00:01:39.601 --> 00:01:42.690
<v Speaker 1>I ran some guys in Las Vegas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he traveled and he,</v>

46
00:01:42.691 --> 00:01:44.880
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of schooled me on their,</v>

47
00:01:44.881 --> 00:01:45.711
<v Speaker 1>on their way of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

48
00:01:45.711 --> 00:01:46.410
<v Speaker 1>of diving.</v>

49
00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:47.243
<v Speaker 1>And I love it man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason I go to Las Vegas and </v>

50
00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.260
<v Speaker 1>they meet all the time that you got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I die with guys.</v>

51
00:01:52.261 --> 00:01:54.870
<v Speaker 1>They died 200,</v>
<v Speaker 1>300 feet every day.</v>

52
00:01:54.871 --> 00:01:55.531
<v Speaker 1>Every week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

53
00:01:55.531 --> 00:01:59.220
<v Speaker 1>so getting around the people that die of</v>
<v Speaker 1>it regularly and know their shit,</v>

54
00:01:59.221 --> 00:02:00.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it to teach me the way,</v>

55
00:02:00.571 --> 00:02:02.010
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think,</v>

56
00:02:02.011 --> 00:02:03.000
<v Speaker 1>thanks travis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I appreciate you.</v>

57
00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.560
<v Speaker 1>Show me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll show me the light brother.</v>

58
00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:06.570
<v Speaker 1>Now when you come up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like from,</v>

59
00:02:06.571 --> 00:02:09.570
<v Speaker 1>how do you know like when you're going </v>
<v Speaker 1>down to my algorithm,</v>

60
00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.960
<v Speaker 1>it's all in your dive computers and you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so your plan,</v>

61
00:02:12.961 --> 00:02:13.531
<v Speaker 1>plan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>plan,</v>

62
00:02:13.531 --> 00:02:14.130
<v Speaker 1>plan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>plan.</v>

63
00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.200
<v Speaker 1>Then you recheck and Lindsey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>

64
00:02:16.201 --> 00:02:17.034
<v Speaker 1>she does the same thing and we check </v>
<v Speaker 1>each other's work and make sure it's </v>

65
00:02:18.901 --> 00:02:21.870
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all our gases are mapped out for how I'm</v>

66
00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:22.733
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's just say we're going to go 150 </v>

67
00:02:23.881 --> 00:02:25.440
<v Speaker 1>feet for ma.</v>

68
00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:26.970
<v Speaker 1>There's a cool,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a cool ship down there.</v>

69
00:02:26.971 --> 00:02:28.890
<v Speaker 1>We want to check out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We want to be there for 35 minutes,</v>

70
00:02:28.891 --> 00:02:31.020
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I put the algorithm and these apps in</v>

71
00:02:31.021 --> 00:02:31.854
<v Speaker 1>our computer or we write it all out and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll tell us exactly how long the </v>

72
00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:35.783
<v Speaker 1>bottom time we can have the stops that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we with the make and the gases that we </v>

73
00:02:37.831 --> 00:02:39.630
<v Speaker 1>have to switch to decompress amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>nitrogen.</v>

74
00:02:39.631 --> 00:02:42.000
<v Speaker 1>In our blood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I make her way to the surface.</v>

75
00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.680
<v Speaker 1>What's the science behind it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>

76
00:02:43.681 --> 00:02:46.320
<v Speaker 1>Why does nitrogen getting your blood?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So because Oh,</v>

77
00:02:46.321 --> 00:02:49.780
<v Speaker 1>from Earth's surface to the atmosphere </v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

78
00:02:49.781 --> 00:02:50.940
<v Speaker 1>is one atmosphere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

79
00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.893
<v Speaker 1>Every 33 feet is another atmosphere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So every time we go down 33 we add </v>

80
00:02:55.261 --> 00:02:56.940
<v Speaker 1>another atmosphere that much more </v>
<v Speaker 1>pressure.</v>

81
00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.350
<v Speaker 1>So right now you're breathing 21% </v>
<v Speaker 1>oxygen,</v>

82
00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:00.400
<v Speaker 1>78%</v>

83
00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.670
<v Speaker 2>78% little bit of like Argon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>other shit.</v>

84
00:03:04.671 --> 00:03:05.860
<v Speaker 2>And then the natural air,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

85
00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:07.630
<v Speaker 2>A lot of nitrogen to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

86
00:03:07.631 --> 00:03:11.470
<v Speaker 2>So 78% of the area right now is </v>
<v Speaker 2>nitrogen.</v>

87
00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:12.633
<v Speaker 2>21% of the oxygen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most of you don't know that if that </v>

88
00:03:14.081 --> 00:03:15.040
<v Speaker 2>you're just breathing oxygen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

89
00:03:15.041 --> 00:03:16.290
<v Speaker 2>you're on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're reading 21% oxygen.</v>

90
00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:17.133
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you off gas it through your tissues </v>

91
00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.100
<v Speaker 2>because there's no pressure on you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

92
00:03:21.101 --> 00:03:21.934
<v Speaker 2>So like right now you're taking a breath</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you breathe out and the </v>

93
00:03:23.741 --> 00:03:24.574
<v Speaker 2>nitrogen just off gasses will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as soon as we start going under the </v>

94
00:03:26.351 --> 00:03:27.184
<v Speaker 2>water,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the amount of pressure holds that in </v>

95
00:03:29.501 --> 00:03:30.430
<v Speaker 2>our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>into our system.</v>

96
00:03:30.431 --> 00:03:32.050
<v Speaker 2>Like if we can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can't off gas it.</v>

97
00:03:32.051 --> 00:03:34.810
<v Speaker 2>So it becomes turned into liquid and </v>
<v Speaker 2>goes into our blood,</v>

98
00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.710
<v Speaker 2>which is what the Benz is with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The guys would be working and then these</v>

99
00:03:38.711 --> 00:03:40.180
<v Speaker 2>come up cause they had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they didn't know.</v>

100
00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:41.140
<v Speaker 2>No one knew until,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

101
00:03:41.141 --> 00:03:41.974
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we didn't know there wasn't a </v>

102
00:03:43.091 --> 00:03:45.640
<v Speaker 2>moon God until all of a sudden we know </v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

103
00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:51.910
<v Speaker 2>Like I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So um,</v>

104
00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:53.433
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they would force the lit the liquid </v>

105
00:03:56.231 --> 00:03:59.830
<v Speaker 2>out of and do a back into a gas by </v>
<v Speaker 2>coming up fast.</v>

106
00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:00.693
<v Speaker 2>So which goes into your joints and cause</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bends and because it makes you her </v>

107
00:04:04.361 --> 00:04:06.190
<v Speaker 2>bend over hurt your back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause that's what they call it,</v>

108
00:04:06.191 --> 00:04:07.060
<v Speaker 2>the bank.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the guys were like,</v>

109
00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:08.170
<v Speaker 2>Oh fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm fucked up.</v>

110
00:04:08.171 --> 00:04:09.460
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got yes.</v>

111
00:04:09.461 --> 00:04:11.080
<v Speaker 2>That's where the term national can kill </v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

112
00:04:11.081 --> 00:04:11.741
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

113
00:04:11.741 --> 00:04:14.530
<v Speaker 2>Well you can encourage them and your </v>
<v Speaker 2>brain blood clot,</v>

114
00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all kinds of crazy kill you instantly.</v>

115
00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:19.480
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we,</v>

116
00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.330
<v Speaker 2>so 150 feet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of a sudden,</v>

117
00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:23.283
<v Speaker 2>25 minutes is up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now we're going to start our ascent and </v>

118
00:04:25.841 --> 00:04:28.180
<v Speaker 2>our computer says it right at 70 feet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We got to do a minute.</v>

119
00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:29.890
<v Speaker 2>At 60 feet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We got two minutes,</v>

120
00:04:29.891 --> 00:04:33.040
<v Speaker 2>we're going to switch gases.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Never my switch to 50% oxygen.</v>

121
00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:34.313
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So increase the amount of oxygen to </v>

122
00:04:35.171 --> 00:04:37.180
<v Speaker 2>which decreases the amount of nitrogen </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we're breathing.</v>

123
00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:40.390
<v Speaker 2>So we're going to speed the offgassing </v>
<v Speaker 2>process cause we're coming up.</v>

124
00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:43.300
<v Speaker 2>So the pressure's coming off this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our body's able to off gas it.</v>

125
00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:44.583
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we just have to do like stages and </v>

126
00:04:46.301 --> 00:04:47.134
<v Speaker 2>it's all through algorithm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the navy dive system been through </v>

127
00:04:50.921 --> 00:04:53.020
<v Speaker 2>years of hundreds of millions of dives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

128
00:04:53.021 --> 00:04:56.470
<v Speaker 2>figuring out the timetables of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>correct amount of time.</v>

129
00:04:56.471 --> 00:05:00.160
<v Speaker 2>You have to be at each dept to off gas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the amount of nitrogen your body's built</v>

130
00:05:00.161 --> 00:05:00.994
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then when you go deeper than that </v>

131
00:05:01.651 --> 00:05:05.050
<v Speaker 2>and you start adding in a tri mix,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we had helium and helium,</v>

132
00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:06.180
<v Speaker 2>helium.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yes,</v>

133
00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:07.870
<v Speaker 2>we had helium into the mix.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

134
00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.360
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's so fun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the fear of,</v>

135
00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:11.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>could I die?</v>

136
00:05:11.321 --> 00:05:11.921
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hell yeah.</v>

137
00:05:11.921 --> 00:05:12.754
<v Speaker 2>That's what I love it.</v>

138
00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:15.040
<v Speaker 2>I'm crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I fucking love it.</v>

139
00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:18.430
<v Speaker 2>And we were talking earlier about </v>
<v Speaker 2>sharks.</v>

140
00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:19.563
<v Speaker 2>I swim after the sharks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I want to get him on the Gopro </v>

141
00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:22.510
<v Speaker 2>there like swimming away from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>sharks.</v>

142
00:05:22.511 --> 00:05:25.290
<v Speaker 2>Don't they don't just eat divers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't need to sweat along a fucking</v>

143
00:05:25.291 --> 00:05:27.790
<v Speaker 2>great white come attack you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like scary to you man.</v>

144
00:05:27.791 --> 00:05:32.410
<v Speaker 2>You're like a big black breeding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll fucking bubbles and shiny,</v>

145
00:05:32.411 --> 00:05:33.244
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they want nothing to do with you and </v>

146
00:05:34.271 --> 00:05:37.420
<v Speaker 2>I'm always trying to chase him down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So most of the shark attack,</v>

147
00:05:37.421 --> 00:05:39.940
<v Speaker 2>so like surface right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause they think it's a cscl up top.</v>

148
00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:41.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And where would you rather,</v>

149
00:05:41.561 --> 00:05:42.394
<v Speaker 2>we were just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were just watching it before you got </v>

150
00:05:43.121 --> 00:05:43.954
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some footage of the shark attacks on on </v>

151
00:05:45.041 --> 00:05:48.820
<v Speaker 2>Youtube and where would you rather be?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd rather fight the fucking shark under</v>

152
00:05:48.821 --> 00:05:50.290
<v Speaker 2>the water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd rather be under,</v>

153
00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:51.400
<v Speaker 2>under instead of on top.</v>

154
00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:52.233
<v Speaker 2>Like if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is this the video I posted yesterday on </v>

159
00:06:04.821 --> 00:06:06.500
<v Speaker 2>What do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just grab his dorsal fin to go for a</v>

160
00:06:06.501 --> 00:06:06.981
<v Speaker 2>ride,</v>

<v Speaker 2>the region in ours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've got four tanks on the water.</v>

201
00:07:35.681 --> 00:07:37.670
<v Speaker 2>you cause you shoot it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It depends if you're using a gun or they</v>

<v Speaker 2>Spiderman and not so much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just a little like a slingshot type </v>

204
00:07:44.571 --> 00:07:45.980
<v Speaker 2>thing he's put on your wrist and let go </v>
<v Speaker 2>of it,</v>

205

<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

206
00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:48.043
<v Speaker 2>But you're the spear guns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll go far and they have like little </v>

207
00:07:49.581 --> 00:07:53.360
<v Speaker 2>reel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can reel it in like how far AH,</v>

208
00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:54.290
<v Speaker 2>50 feet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

209
00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:55.520
<v Speaker 2>Haunted me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

210
00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:57.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they slowed down considerably though.</v>

211
00:07:57.170 --> 00:07:59.900
<v Speaker 2>Report the first few feet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

212
00:07:59.901 --> 00:08:00.734
<v Speaker 2>Right on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you and your depth perception is so </v>

213
00:08:02.031 --> 00:08:03.290
<v Speaker 2>different underwater.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's kind of,</v>

214
00:08:03.291 --> 00:08:04.940
<v Speaker 2>you got to aim above them.</v>

215
00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:06.890
<v Speaker 2>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like a bright right?</v>

216
00:08:06.891 --> 00:08:08.260
<v Speaker 2>There were fractions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

217
00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:10.730
<v Speaker 2>That's the same when you shooting down </v>
<v Speaker 2>when they go hunting boat.</v>

218
00:08:10.731 --> 00:08:12.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They both fish in the water.</v>

219
00:08:12.351 --> 00:08:15.140
<v Speaker 2>You got to like aim six inches under </v>
<v Speaker 2>where you think it's going to be.</v>

220
00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:17.570
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are now when you're,</v>

221
00:08:17.571 --> 00:08:18.404
<v Speaker 2>when you're diving,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like how long have you been doing </v>

222
00:08:19.521 --> 00:08:20.300
<v Speaker 2>this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>First of all?</v>

223
00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:22.550
<v Speaker 2>Well I got certified in high school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>High School.</v>

224
00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:23.833
<v Speaker 2>Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you've been doing this for a long </v>

225
00:08:24.231 --> 00:08:25.064
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just like going 30 40 feet </v>

226
00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:28.760
<v Speaker 2>recreational diving,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

227
00:08:28.761 --> 00:08:32.360
<v Speaker 2>go and see some stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I shouldn't say stupid,</v>

228
00:08:32.361 --> 00:08:34.090
<v Speaker 2>but like that's like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

229
00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:36.760
<v Speaker 2>the recreation they do is go see a reef </v>
<v Speaker 2>but one read,</v>

230
00:08:36.761 --> 00:08:38.470
<v Speaker 2>it looks like every reef.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

231
00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:40.130
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I kind of got over that.</v>

232
00:08:40.131 --> 00:08:42.650
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I met with these guys and doing the shit</v>

233
00:08:42.651 --> 00:08:43.940
<v Speaker 2>that only 5% of the world do.</v>

234
00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:45.770
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my goal was to go 500 feet.</v>

235
00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:50.300
<v Speaker 2>So I've been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been just shy of 300 and yeah,</v>

236
00:08:50.301 --> 00:08:53.000
<v Speaker 2>there's just a lot of planning and crazy</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit that goes involved with me and your</v>

237
00:08:53.001 --> 00:08:54.890
<v Speaker 2>dad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pretty much anything goes wrong.</v>

238
00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:56.670
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how long does it take you to get up from</v>

239
00:08:56.671 --> 00:09:01.671
<v Speaker 2>the 300 at from 300 it's about a 50 </v>
<v Speaker 2>minute decaux time back of the surface.</v>

240
00:09:03.171 --> 00:09:04.650
<v Speaker 2>So five zero.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

241
00:09:04.651 --> 00:09:07.290
<v Speaker 2>So it's about a three hour dive </v>
<v Speaker 2>completely.</v>

242
00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:10.170
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now if something goes wrong,</v>

243
00:09:10.171 --> 00:09:12.930
<v Speaker 2>like if you're cord gets cut when you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>down there and just heard,</v>

244
00:09:12.931 --> 00:09:14.970
<v Speaker 2>but we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you bleed in oxygen,</v>

245
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.920
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You shut one off and go to your cell.</v>

246
00:09:16.921 --> 00:09:17.754
<v Speaker 2>You always carry enough getting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one's ever died because you have too </v>

247
00:09:18.961 --> 00:09:19.830
<v Speaker 2>much gas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

248
00:09:19.831 --> 00:09:20.561
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

249
00:09:20.561 --> 00:09:21.900
<v Speaker 2>And carry it with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

250
00:09:21.901 --> 00:09:23.940
<v Speaker 2>So a lot of the mixtures we bring with </v>
<v Speaker 2>us,</v>

251
00:09:23.941 --> 00:09:25.560
<v Speaker 2>like my back gas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll just be regular,</v>

252
00:09:25.650 --> 00:09:30.000
<v Speaker 2>either try and mix gas or regular air </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then I'll have a 36% oxygen,</v>

253
00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:32.250
<v Speaker 2>which is to about a hundred feet.</v>

254
00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:33.383
<v Speaker 2>So if anything were to go on my back as </v>
<v Speaker 2>I can haul ass to a hundred feet and </v>

255
00:09:35.341 --> 00:09:36.660
<v Speaker 2>then start my depo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

256
00:09:36.661 --> 00:09:39.360
<v Speaker 2>And really there's like protocol and all</v>
<v Speaker 2>kinds of different,</v>

257
00:09:39.361 --> 00:09:40.194
<v Speaker 2>plus I'm driving with a buddy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which would be you and you have all the </v>

258
00:09:43.381 --> 00:09:44.071
<v Speaker 2>gas in new too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

259
00:09:44.071 --> 00:09:45.560
<v Speaker 2>and you would be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

260
00:09:45.570 --> 00:09:47.040
<v Speaker 2>arms length away from me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some shit went down.</v>

261
00:09:47.041 --> 00:09:48.590
<v Speaker 2>I could give you my gowns here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

262
00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:50.730
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Give you regulator and take,</v>

263
00:09:50.731 --> 00:09:53.160
<v Speaker 2>you have one that hangs on your neck and</v>
<v Speaker 2>one that you're using.</v>

264
00:09:53.161 --> 00:09:55.350
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd give me yours and put yours in and</v>

265
00:09:55.351 --> 00:09:56.550
<v Speaker 2>we'd figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

266
00:09:56.551 --> 00:09:59.430
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if I was off screwing off and doing</v>

267
00:09:59.431 --> 00:10:01.920
<v Speaker 2>something I shouldn't be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I'm fucking 99% doing,</v>

268
00:10:03.790 --> 00:10:06.090
<v Speaker 2>then I got to rely on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>never rely on myself.</v>

269
00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:07.680
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

270
00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:09.750
<v Speaker 2>we can't talk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So talk,</v>

271
00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:10.613
<v Speaker 2>you have to say.</v>

272
00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:12.780
<v Speaker 2>So me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>me and Lindsay were in,</v>

273
00:10:12.781 --> 00:10:13.614
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Florida dive dive in the Spiegel </v>

274
00:10:15.601 --> 00:10:16.530
<v Speaker 2>Grove,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a giant,</v>

275
00:10:16.531 --> 00:10:18.870
<v Speaker 2>like a shoot ship and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

276
00:10:18.871 --> 00:10:22.230
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the key west and we kind of ship.</v>

277
00:10:22.231 --> 00:10:23.940
<v Speaker 2>Was it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it,</v>

278
00:10:23.941 --> 00:10:26.310
<v Speaker 2>the Spiegel Grove is aircraft carrier or</v>
<v Speaker 2>if that's the vandy,</v>

279
00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:27.300
<v Speaker 2>I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm getting confused.</v>

280
00:10:27.301 --> 00:10:31.830
<v Speaker 2>But one's like a giant aircraft carrier </v>
<v Speaker 2>and one's a like a destroyer.</v>

281
00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:33.720
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>500 feet.</v>

282
00:10:33.721 --> 00:10:36.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're natural reefs.</v>

283
00:10:36.081 --> 00:10:37.440
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the government song,</v>

284
00:10:37.450 --> 00:10:39.780
<v Speaker 2>Camino cut a bunch of holes in for </v>
<v Speaker 2>idiots like me to go solve this song,</v>

285
00:10:39.781 --> 00:10:40.614
<v Speaker 2>come on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Purpose.</v>

286
00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:42.900
<v Speaker 2>So they take all the fluids out of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They a sink.</v>

287
00:10:42.901 --> 00:10:44.730
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to make them artificial reefs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

288
00:10:44.731 --> 00:10:45.564
<v Speaker 2>And so they do this because the </v>
<v Speaker 2>decommission the ship and they don't </v>

289
00:10:47.371 --> 00:10:48.230
<v Speaker 2>know what to do with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

290
00:10:48.231 --> 00:10:49.740
<v Speaker 2>so this is a good move?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

291
00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:50.670
<v Speaker 2>Make it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just put less,</v>

292
00:10:50.671 --> 00:10:55.671
<v Speaker 2>let us fish and wildlife hang out and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then they make money off guys like me.</v>

293
00:10:55.831 --> 00:10:56.101
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>that'd be something that would fucking </v>

328
00:12:15.161 --> 00:12:16.930
<v Speaker 1>love to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was watching the show,</v>

329
00:12:16.931 --> 00:12:18.730
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember what ocean they were,</v>

331
00:12:20.441 --> 00:12:21.274
<v Speaker 1>But these guys were professional </v>
<v Speaker 1>treasure hunters and they found some </v>

332
00:12:24.341 --> 00:12:26.210
<v Speaker 1>insane amount of goals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like some,</v>

334
00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:29.733
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they were trying to figure out who </v>

335
00:12:30.491 --> 00:12:32.800
<v Speaker 1>gets the gold and who claims it in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Me Too.</v>

337
00:12:37.510 --> 00:12:38.343
<v Speaker 1>But you have to be like really careful </v>
<v Speaker 1>about like giving out the location and </v>

338
00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:45.790
<v Speaker 1>other treasure hunters would find it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like is a big business in that shit.</v>

339
00:12:45.810 --> 00:12:46.643

<v Speaker 1>so like let's just say me and you go </v>

340
00:12:47.501 --> 00:12:49.300

<v Speaker 1>the spot.</v>

341
00:12:49.301 --> 00:12:51.340
<v Speaker 1>We find it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We jumped down also and we find all this</v>

342
00:12:51.341 --> 00:12:52.440
<v Speaker 1>golden,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this treasure.</v>

343
00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:55.060
<v Speaker 1>We only have enough gas for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who knows,</v>

344
00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:57.440
<v Speaker 1>20 minutes down there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we got to come back up.</v>

345
00:12:57.441 --> 00:12:59.260
<v Speaker 1>We couldn't even bring the fucking gold </v>
<v Speaker 1>this trip.</v>

346
00:12:59.261 --> 00:13:01.060
<v Speaker 1>And we want it to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right now we're back in the belt.</v>

347
00:13:01.061 --> 00:13:02.150

<v Speaker 1>I know the boat.</v>

348
00:13:02.151 --> 00:13:05.110
<v Speaker 1>CAPP knows who else is with us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now we've got to figure out who do we</v>

349
00:13:05.111 --> 00:13:07.200
<v Speaker 1>tell and do we tell us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>spoke at it.</v>

354
00:13:13.630 --> 00:13:14.980
<v Speaker 1>really tricky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to kill the captain.</v>

355
00:13:15.010 --> 00:13:16.730
<v Speaker 1>You would have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd have throat.</v>

356
00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:18.950
<v Speaker 1>Do you know how to use a gps?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

359
00:13:21.851 --> 00:13:24.850
<v Speaker 1>You'd have to drop a pin on and you'd </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to kill that guy and drop him where</v>

360
00:13:24.851 --> 00:13:28.900
<v Speaker 1>the pin is or don't kill him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to cut him in.</v>

361
00:13:28.930 --> 00:13:31.300
<v Speaker 1>He's got to get a third something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

362
00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:35.320
<v Speaker 1>Or Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much money he gets a third for.</v>

363
00:13:35.410 --> 00:13:36.243
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're talking probably millions of </v>

364
00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:38.830
<v Speaker 1>dollars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you don't give them a third,</v>

365
00:13:38.831 --> 00:13:40.050
<v Speaker 1>he's going to fucking a rat and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:40.990
<v Speaker 1>fuck yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

367
00:13:40.991 --> 00:13:42.790
<v Speaker 1>You have to give him a third because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got to think,</v>

368
00:13:43.090 --> 00:13:45.100
<v Speaker 1>if he didn't take you there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd never got it.</v>

369
00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:47.620
<v Speaker 1>And it's a shitload of money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's free.</v>

370
00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:49.720
<v Speaker 1>And so he says half,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then what do you do?</v>

371
00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:53.770
<v Speaker 1>Fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you kick his ass like you don't let</v>

372
00:13:53.771 --> 00:13:55.450
<v Speaker 1>them get half.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to be generous.</v>

373
00:13:55.451 --> 00:13:57.340
<v Speaker 1>But if he tries to fuck you on your </v>
<v Speaker 1>generosity,</v>

374
00:13:57.370 --> 00:13:58.203
<v Speaker 1>that's when you kill them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many people have probably been </v>

375
00:14:00.581 --> 00:14:04.950
<v Speaker 1>killed over shipwrecks and pirate shit?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

376
00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:08.680

<v Speaker 1>Try to make it across the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

380
00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:16.233
<v Speaker 1>Plus if I was a pirate I'd be no one </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're loading your is up and I'd </v>

381

387
00:14:34.691 --> 00:14:39.370
<v Speaker 1>involved because it costs hundreds of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousands of dollars to make millions of</v>

388
00:14:39.370 --> 00:14:41.260

<v Speaker 1>colors they can change,</v>

437
00:16:33.981 --> 00:16:36.800
<v Speaker 1>but you just see him fucking crawl on </v>
<v Speaker 1>all across the ground saying,</v>

<v Speaker 1>cool.</v>

439
00:16:37.370 --> 00:16:38.203
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is so bizarre to end these </v>

440
00:16:41.631 --> 00:16:42.464
<v Speaker 1>thousands of ships that they like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One day they're going to figure out </v>

441
00:16:44.961 --> 00:16:45.794
<v Speaker 1>technology to go and find those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're gonna be able to locate all of </v>

442
00:16:48.051 --> 00:16:48.884
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But right now when they're willing so </v>

443
00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:52.460
<v Speaker 1>there wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the rotting away.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I mean there's,</v>

445
00:16:53.750 --> 00:16:55.130
<v Speaker 1>there's not much left of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

446
00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:57.280
<v Speaker 1>The metal ships are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>

447
00:16:57.340 --> 00:16:59.750
<v Speaker 1>are the only thing that I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've done one wouldn't,</v>

448
00:16:59.810 --> 00:17:01.290
<v Speaker 1>and it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was shit,</v>

449
00:17:01.330 --> 00:17:02.810
<v Speaker 1>it was like all fallen apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

450
00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:03.913
<v Speaker 1>they don't find much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what's left is like the pottery and </v>

451
00:17:06.891 --> 00:17:07.724
<v Speaker 1>the goals and the coins and things along</v>
<v Speaker 1>those lines to find some certain metal </v>

452
00:17:12.141 --> 00:17:13.670
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like swords,</v>

453
00:17:13.671 --> 00:17:15.860
<v Speaker 1>swords right away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not dimensioned dead bodies.</v>

454
00:17:16.430 --> 00:17:21.320
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you're finding a ship that no </v>
<v Speaker 1>one's ever seen does probably cook right</v>

455
00:17:21.410 --> 00:17:22.243
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll find some fucking dead body type </v>

456
00:17:23.091 --> 00:17:23.450
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

457
00:17:23.450 --> 00:17:24.680
<v Speaker 1>Some haunted shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

458
00:17:24.681 --> 00:17:26.900
<v Speaker 1>Type of about putting your heartbeat </v>
<v Speaker 1>through the roof,</v>

459
00:17:26.901 --> 00:17:27.734
<v Speaker 1>going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>opening the hatch and just seeing a </v>

460
00:17:29.030 --> 00:17:31.250
<v Speaker 1>skeleton head fall in your lap that </v>
<v Speaker 1>both,</v>

461
00:17:31.251 --> 00:17:35.250
<v Speaker 1>that they found that was adrift and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a dude who had turned into a,</v>

462
00:17:35.270 --> 00:17:39.740
<v Speaker 1>essentially he had turned into a mummy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had been mummified by the sea air and</v>

463
00:17:39.741 --> 00:17:42.770
<v Speaker 1>dried out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>slumped over the table.</v>

464
00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:46.310
<v Speaker 1>Like he had a table in the galley.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He slumped over the table and he's dead.</v>

465
00:17:46.311 --> 00:17:48.860
<v Speaker 1>There he is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how they found that dude,</v>

466
00:17:48.930 --> 00:17:49.763
<v Speaker 1>because I feel like that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the same movement anyone's going </v>

467
00:17:52.041 --> 00:17:56.520
<v Speaker 1>to do when you're on your last leg and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in a boat that's fucking sick and</v>

468
00:17:56.630 --> 00:17:57.840
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the move we're going to do.</v>

469
00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:03.080
<v Speaker 1>It says mommy found on boat missing </v>
<v Speaker 1>since 2009 one leg out,</v>

470
00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:06.450
<v Speaker 1>pour one leg out posted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

471
00:18:06.451 --> 00:18:07.770
<v Speaker 1>I guess this is it.</v>

472
00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:12.030
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if another person would have </v>
<v Speaker 1>made it.</v>

473
00:18:12.510 --> 00:18:16.380
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if he was a pussy one if he </v>
<v Speaker 1>gave out.</v>

474
00:18:16.530 --> 00:18:17.040
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

475
00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:19.890
<v Speaker 1>we've got tired of fishing boats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably the,</v>

476
00:18:19.891 --> 00:18:22.200
<v Speaker 1>it's the fresh water that gets Ya.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

477
00:18:22.270 --> 00:18:24.980
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm sure you can eat fish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

478
00:18:24.990 --> 00:18:25.823
<v Speaker 1>it'd be the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'd be the water that would get you </v>

479
00:18:26.481 --> 00:18:27.590
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how long,</v>

480
00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:29.820
<v Speaker 1>how long have you changed personally?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

481
00:18:29.821 --> 00:18:30.654
<v Speaker 1>I could go a week without water from my </v>
<v Speaker 1>cuts and one 55 so I know I could do a </v>

482
00:18:33.631 --> 00:18:34.830
<v Speaker 1>week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

483
00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:37.470
<v Speaker 1>And that'd be after that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm on my,</v>

484
00:18:37.471 --> 00:18:38.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm on my death bed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

485
00:18:38.341 --> 00:18:39.360
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's talk about that.</v>

486
00:18:39.390 --> 00:18:41.620
<v Speaker 1>Don't do that anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't do that anymore.</v>

487
00:18:41.860 --> 00:18:42.693
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you keep talking about like </v>

488
00:18:43.531 --> 00:18:46.080
<v Speaker 1>fighting Eddie Alvarez cause you already</v>
<v Speaker 1>beat him and now he's the champ.</v>

489
00:18:46.081 --> 00:18:48.570
<v Speaker 1>But God damn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're looking good at one 70.</v>

490
00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:50.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you say,</v>

491
00:18:50.221 --> 00:18:53.470
<v Speaker 1>I didn't look good if 55 I've sensation </v>
<v Speaker 1>with 55,</v>

492
00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:57.060
<v Speaker 1>nine 10 70 or my last run world beater </v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

493
00:18:57.240 --> 00:19:01.320
<v Speaker 1>It's not just that you look good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just the way you look.</v>

494
00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:02.550
<v Speaker 1>It's like you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

495
00:19:02.551 --> 00:19:03.384
<v Speaker 1>you hit a whole new level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I always wonder like is it because </v>

496
00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:08.700
<v Speaker 1>obviously you keep training,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously you keep getting better.</v>

497
00:19:08.701 --> 00:19:10.560
<v Speaker 1>Obviously you work hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all those things,</v>

498
00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:12.270
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>learning from experience,</v>

499
00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:15.180
<v Speaker 1>all those things are a factor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But on top of that,</v>

500
00:19:15.690 --> 00:19:20.280
<v Speaker 1>there's also the factor of you not </v>
<v Speaker 1>having a cut that fucking wait man.</v>

501
00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:25.400
<v Speaker 1>So this last fight against rick story </v>
<v Speaker 1>against Rick Story.</v>

502
00:19:25.510 --> 00:19:27.000
<v Speaker 1>It looked like you were in the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>matrix.</v>

503
00:19:27.001 --> 00:19:27.834
<v Speaker 1>That was some Anderson Silva's shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I ate five guys three nights that we </v>

504
00:19:31.441 --> 00:19:32.820

<v Speaker 1>hamburgers,</v>

506
00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:35.573
<v Speaker 1>bevels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a food bacon and of those </v>

513
00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:50.370
<v Speaker 1>It was an easy no brainer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

514
00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:51.233
<v Speaker 1>But when I saw you before the fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before that you were a one 76 when you </v>

<v Speaker 1>That's for damn sure.</v>

519
00:20:01.831 --> 00:20:04.500
<v Speaker 1>But isn't that a factor?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean look how fast you are.</v>

568
00:21:58.090 --> 00:21:59.520
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started off kickboxing.</v>

569
00:21:59.610 --> 00:22:01.330
<v Speaker 2>A buddy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a buddy of mine just told me,</v>

570
00:22:01.331 --> 00:22:02.860
<v Speaker 2>you think your telecom tries kickbox and</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>

571
00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:05.300
<v Speaker 2>And I went down and fell in love with it</v>
<v Speaker 2>and two weeks to train,</v>

572
00:22:05.770 --> 00:22:08.410
<v Speaker 2>first way to try,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

573
00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:11.080
<v Speaker 2>commerce,</v>
<v Speaker 2>city rec center in Commerce city,</v>

574
00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:12.180
<v Speaker 2>Denver.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like in the,</v>

00:22:12.730 --> 00:22:17.710
<v Speaker 2>it was this rec center that offered </v>
<v Speaker 2>Taekwondo Tuesdays and Thursday nights.</v>

576
00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:21.450
<v Speaker 2>And I'd go in there and we'd spar and </v>
<v Speaker 2>sparring is all I did.</v>

577
00:22:21.451 --> 00:22:22.284
<v Speaker 2>Like that's what I used to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought that was getting ready for a </v>

578
00:22:24.761 --> 00:22:26.530
<v Speaker 2>fight would be just be fucking throwing </v>
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>

579
00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:29.060
<v Speaker 2>Now I don't spar at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

580
00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:31.750
<v Speaker 2>all I do is drill because drilling is </v>
<v Speaker 2>the most important that you do.</v>

581
00:22:31.751 --> 00:22:32.584
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

582
00:22:33.250 --> 00:22:35.680
<v Speaker 2>it's what we would do a spa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you don't spar at all?</v>

583
00:22:35.681 --> 00:22:37.390
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really interesting.</v>

584
00:22:37.540 --> 00:22:38.141
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

585
00:22:38.141 --> 00:22:40.900
<v Speaker 2>and I tell my training partners and </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone that tried to,</v>

586
00:22:40.901 --> 00:22:41.711
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>try to get me so far,</v>

587
00:22:41.711 --> 00:22:43.600
<v Speaker 2>but now they're okay with me just </v>
<v Speaker 2>drilling.</v>

588
00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:47.950
<v Speaker 2>But I feel like the little guy at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Walmart in click and every time you take</v>

589
00:22:47.951 --> 00:22:49.390
<v Speaker 2>a hit your head,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he pushes the button.</v>

590
00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:50.253
<v Speaker 2>How many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many people go in Walmart for it's </v>

591
00:22:51.131 --> 00:22:52.120
<v Speaker 2>full?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

592
00:22:52.370 --> 00:22:53.530
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea.</v>

593
00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:56.380
<v Speaker 2>How many more do I got?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was a very good point.</v>

594
00:22:56.381 --> 00:23:00.820
<v Speaker 2>Fucking brawls to me and Leonard Garcia </v>
<v Speaker 2>have in the training room.</v>

595
00:23:00.940 --> 00:23:02.000
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

596
00:23:02.590 --> 00:23:05.340
<v Speaker 2>So like I'll get in there and move </v>
<v Speaker 2>around with Andre and,</v>

597
00:23:05.341 --> 00:23:06.174
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and move around with the all the </v>

598
00:23:08.510 --> 00:23:10.750
<v Speaker 2>heavyweights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like light mma,</v>

599
00:23:10.751 --> 00:23:11.530
<v Speaker 2>sparring,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

600
00:23:11.530 --> 00:23:13.750
<v Speaker 2>heavy takedowns and grappling real like </v>
<v Speaker 2>striking,</v>

601
00:23:13.751 --> 00:23:14.250
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

602
00:23:14.250 --> 00:23:16.150
<v Speaker 2>but the days of putting the big loads on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thrown down,</v>

603
00:23:16.151 --> 00:23:16.984
<v Speaker 2>hell no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just did it with Joe Sheila and the </v>

604
00:23:18.910 --> 00:23:19.750
<v Speaker 2>other day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I can't really say Hell No.</v>

605
00:23:19.751 --> 00:23:22.300
<v Speaker 2>But him and I had a good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good tempo and it wasn't anything crazy.</v>

606
00:23:22.301 --> 00:23:23.134
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've watched videos that you guys </v>

607
00:23:24.041 --> 00:23:25.450
<v Speaker 2>sparring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seemed very controlled,</v>

608
00:23:25.451 --> 00:23:27.070
<v Speaker 2>very controlled,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that if you,</v>

609
00:23:27.170 --> 00:23:28.003
<v Speaker 2>if I'm sparring with someone that's very</v>
<v Speaker 2>controlled and doesn't try and kill me </v>

610
00:23:30.220 --> 00:23:33.100
<v Speaker 2>and cool,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but man going in with some of those guys</v>

611
00:23:33.101 --> 00:23:34.870
<v Speaker 2>that are trying to make a name at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>gym,</v>

612
00:23:34.871 --> 00:23:37.150
<v Speaker 2>just want to crank you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I got to fuck him up.</v>

613
00:23:37.151 --> 00:23:39.510
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now we're fighting and you know,</v>

614
00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:43.690
<v Speaker 2>that's a funny contradiction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like I love to fight.</v>

615
00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:45.920
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to spar.</v>

616
00:23:46.290 --> 00:23:48.350
<v Speaker 1>I love if I don't want to get hit </v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

617
00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:50.810
<v Speaker 1>Is there any way we could do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>These beer say America.</v>

618
00:23:50.850 --> 00:23:51.730
<v Speaker 1>You see America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I said,</v>

619
00:23:51.870 --> 00:23:54.020

<v Speaker 1>Is this a new thing?</v>

620
00:23:56.180 --> 00:23:58.490
<v Speaker 1>America?</v>

621
00:23:58.700 --> 00:24:00.090

622
00:24:00.350 --> 00:24:03.530
<v Speaker 1>and I don't want to have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what if a course comes along?</v>

636
00:24:26.001 --> 00:24:27.770
<v Speaker 1>I think that's very wise now when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

637
00:24:27.771 --> 00:24:31.070
<v Speaker 1>when you're doing drills like explain to</v>
<v Speaker 1>me how you're doing them.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you setting everything up.</v>

639
00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:35.210
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from a,</v>

640
00:24:35.211 --> 00:24:39.410
<v Speaker 1>a striking standpoint where like you </v>
<v Speaker 1>work in combinations and then counter.</v>

641
00:24:39.411 --> 00:24:40.244
<v Speaker 1>So those combinations and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibilities of all the different </v>

642
00:24:42.411 --> 00:24:44.470
<v Speaker 1>things that could happen somewhere with </v>
<v Speaker 1>brandon gives me now,</v>

643
00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:46.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's fucking great tactician or man,</v>

644
00:24:46.301 --> 00:24:47.210
<v Speaker 1>big fan of that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

645
00:24:47.211 --> 00:24:48.044
<v Speaker 1>he breaks his break.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I don't ever watch tape and people </v>

646
00:24:50.241 --> 00:24:51.560
<v Speaker 1>think that's so crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't,</v>

647
00:24:51.650 --> 00:24:53.120
<v Speaker 1>I just don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they do.</v>

648
00:24:53.330 --> 00:24:55.450
<v Speaker 1>So my coaches do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he'll come and he'll be like this,</v>

649
00:24:55.730 --> 00:24:58.340
<v Speaker 1>we're working on this because I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what story is going to do.</v>

650
00:24:58.370 --> 00:24:59.203
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we knew he was gonna come with big over </v>

651
00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:02.030
<v Speaker 1>hands and the needs of the body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to be there.</v>

652
00:25:02.031 --> 00:25:04.190
<v Speaker 1>So everything we drill is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

653
00:25:04.191 --> 00:25:06.320
<v Speaker 1>when he does this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make it reactionary,</v>

654
00:25:06.321 --> 00:25:07.154
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I feel like that's all good and </v>

655
00:25:09.141 --> 00:25:09.974
<v Speaker 1>great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the good thing is I know how to </v>

656
00:25:10.911 --> 00:25:14.090
<v Speaker 1>fucking fight like deep down in my soul,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so everything,</v>

657
00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:15.013
<v Speaker 1>all of that doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can just fucking bite down and give </v>

<v Speaker 1>Jeremy Stephens had a very similar </v>

660
00:25:20.180 --> 00:25:21.530
<v Speaker 1>sentiment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

661
00:25:21.531 --> 00:25:22.670
<v Speaker 1>I already know how to fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

663
00:25:23.661 --> 00:25:26.690
<v Speaker 1>it's all about just getting prepared,</v>
<v Speaker 1>working on my cardio,</v>

664
00:25:26.691 --> 00:25:29.360
<v Speaker 1>working on my fitness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>working on my drills and my techniques.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

699
00:26:39.690 --> 00:26:42.740
<v Speaker 1>I started thinking something was fucked </v>
<v Speaker 1>up with my brain.</v>

700
00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:43.980
<v Speaker 1>So I start brushing</v>

701
00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:44.813
<v Speaker 2>my teeth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One morning I fall over and I hit the </v>

702
00:26:45.781 --> 00:26:46.614
<v Speaker 2>wall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I literally fell over and like hit </v>

703
00:26:48.481 --> 00:26:51.210
<v Speaker 2>my shoulder on my wall and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck?</v>

704
00:26:52.180 --> 00:26:53.580
<v Speaker 2>And I close on on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I fell over,</v>

705
00:26:53.581 --> 00:26:55.500
<v Speaker 2>hit the other wall and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh man,</v>

706
00:26:56.130 --> 00:26:57.330
<v Speaker 2>something's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

707
00:26:57.331 --> 00:27:00.510
<v Speaker 2>like something seriously wrong with my </v>
<v Speaker 2>brain.</v>

708
00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:02.033
<v Speaker 2>And I started freaking out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I go get a cat scan and go get an </v>

709
00:27:04.651 --> 00:27:06.900
<v Speaker 2>MRI.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And A,</v>

710
00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:08.513
<v Speaker 2>I'm convinced that I'm God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm concussed and that I've taken too </v>

711
00:27:11.491 --> 00:27:13.030
<v Speaker 2>many shots and I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

712
00:27:13.031 --> 00:27:14.400
<v Speaker 2>it's because it's a w what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

713
00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:15.293
<v Speaker 2>let me back the story of a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why I think this is because my buddy </v>

714
00:27:17.221 --> 00:27:19.220
<v Speaker 2>Scott Parker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's the enforcer for the,</v>

715
00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:20.540
<v Speaker 2>for the Colorado Avalanche,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

716
00:27:20.820 --> 00:27:21.653
<v Speaker 2>he can no longer take,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he has like a problem with his </v>

717
00:27:22.801 --> 00:27:24.600
<v Speaker 2>brainstem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He took too many punches.</v>

718
00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:26.610
<v Speaker 2>If he takes talks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it takes one more,</v>

719
00:27:26.611 --> 00:27:27.361
<v Speaker 2>it's going to kill him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

720
00:27:27.361 --> 00:27:31.680
<v Speaker 2>So I'm like talking to him about this </v>
<v Speaker 2>and now he's like got it in my mind that</v>

721
00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:34.200
<v Speaker 2>I had the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm thinking like I fall over,</v>

722
00:27:34.201 --> 00:27:35.310
<v Speaker 2>like literally fall over,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hit the wall.</v>

723
00:27:35.311 --> 00:27:35.851
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh fuck,</v>

724
00:27:35.851 --> 00:27:37.500
<v Speaker 2>something's really fucked up with me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyways,</v>

725
00:27:37.501 --> 00:27:39.790
<v Speaker 2>I go and get all these tests,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go see uh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>can't drain because my is deviated.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I had to get on medication and get it </v>
<v Speaker 2>cleared up,</v>

731
00:27:56.941 --> 00:27:59.010
<v Speaker 2>but that's why I fuck my equilibrium up.</v>

780
00:29:44.870 --> 00:29:45.703

811
00:30:51.220 --> 00:30:56.220
<v Speaker 3>That's your body's going equaled out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

812
00:30:57.501 --> 00:31:00.130
<v Speaker 3>I got same park that makes you want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>fight and makes you want to fuck.</v>

813
00:31:00.220 --> 00:31:03.670
<v Speaker 3>Gotcha.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a part of the whole gorilla DNA,</v>

814
00:31:03.740 --> 00:31:04.571
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

815
00:31:04.571 --> 00:31:05.500
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

816
00:31:05.710 --> 00:31:06.543
<v Speaker 3>well are you taking a t plus?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you take that optimizes your </v>

817
00:31:09.821 --> 00:31:11.230
<v Speaker 3>hormones?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a big one.</v>

818
00:31:11.410 --> 00:31:13.060
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's Alpha brain,</v>

819
00:31:13.061 --> 00:31:15.670
<v Speaker 3>which one of the good things about Alpha</v>
<v Speaker 3>brain is mental fatigue.</v>

820
00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:16.713
<v Speaker 3>One of the things that helps you in your</v>
<v Speaker 3>workouts is like a lot of times like </v>

821
00:31:19.301 --> 00:31:22.750
<v Speaker 3>physical fatigue is one factor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but mental fatigue is a factor too.</v>

822
00:31:22.930 --> 00:31:25.030
<v Speaker 3>Like when you step up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even if your body's tired,</v>

823
00:31:25.180 --> 00:31:26.013
<v Speaker 3>if your mind feels good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could find out that you can force </v>

824
00:31:28.271 --> 00:31:31.600
<v Speaker 3>your body to go through the motions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can force your body to do it because</v>

825
00:31:31.601 --> 00:31:35.230
<v Speaker 3>your mind still feels energetic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when my mind feels shitty,</v>

826
00:31:35.231 --> 00:31:38.140
<v Speaker 3>like for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the hardest workouts by far,</v>

827
00:31:38.290 --> 00:31:40.000
<v Speaker 3>or when I'm hung over I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

828
00:31:40.170 --> 00:31:42.490
<v Speaker 3>cause my mind is tired.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

829
00:31:42.491 --> 00:31:44.350
<v Speaker 3>it's not even like my body can't lift </v>
<v Speaker 3>the weight.</v>

830
00:31:44.351 --> 00:31:46.650
<v Speaker 3>It's like my body's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

831
00:31:47.540 --> 00:31:51.250
<v Speaker 3>but my mind is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't muster it.</v>

832
00:31:52.090 --> 00:31:55.750
<v Speaker 3>So Alpha brain post drinking is </v>
<v Speaker 3>fantastic.</v>

833
00:31:55.780 --> 00:31:56.613
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the best things for </v>
<v Speaker 3>hangovers because a lot of things that </v>

834
00:31:59.381 --> 00:32:01.120
<v Speaker 3>are going on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're dehydrated.</v>

835
00:32:01.121 --> 00:32:01.954
<v Speaker 3>That's a big factor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But also like all your electrolytes are </v>

836
00:32:04.271 --> 00:32:05.104
<v Speaker 3>all fucked up and all your </v>
<v Speaker 3>neurotransmitter levels are all fucked </v>

837
00:32:07.931 --> 00:32:08.764
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could Jack those backup with Alpha </v>

838
00:32:10.271 --> 00:32:11.104
<v Speaker 3>brain and knew mood knew mood's a big </v>
<v Speaker 3>one too because it brings up your </v>

839
00:32:13.541 --> 00:32:16.960
<v Speaker 3>serotonin levels and that's what I have </v>
<v Speaker 3>each team that comes into the night pack</v>

840
00:32:16.961 --> 00:32:17.800
<v Speaker 3>for sleeping,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

841
00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:18.770
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Perfect.</v>

842
00:32:18.771 --> 00:32:20.850
<v Speaker 3>And I tell people who are trying to </v>
<v Speaker 3>steal off thing,</v>

843
00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:22.900
<v Speaker 3>but listen to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>please don't buy it.</v>

844
00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:25.930
<v Speaker 3>Please don't buy it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Find out what the ingredients are.</v>

845
00:32:26.020 --> 00:32:27.940
<v Speaker 3>Go buy your own shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go by it.</v>

846
00:32:27.941 --> 00:32:30.700
<v Speaker 3>That the best form you can buy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the most important thing.</v>

847
00:32:30.701 --> 00:32:33.310
<v Speaker 3>By the purest best version of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can find.</v>

848
00:32:33.490 --> 00:32:35.320
<v Speaker 3>Use all those things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Use Coleen.</v>

849
00:32:35.470 --> 00:32:36.303
<v Speaker 3>He has all these different ingredients.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're going to find an Alpha brain and </v>

850
00:32:38.771 --> 00:32:40.340
<v Speaker 3>all the different ingredients.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're going to find a new mood.</v>

851
00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:41.413
<v Speaker 3>You're going to have results,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you want to get it made for you </v>

852
00:32:44.390 --> 00:32:46.910
<v Speaker 3>in the best possible form,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what we sell.</v>

853
00:32:46.940 --> 00:32:48.710
<v Speaker 3>That's what we're trying to do it on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're just trying to,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I literally feel the Best I've felt in </v>

859
00:33:01.251 --> 00:33:04.130
<v Speaker 3>my life and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if it has to do with solely</v>

860

<v Speaker 3>take it on or just reinventing myself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

<v Speaker 3>water.</v>

<v Speaker 3>psychedelics.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Most transcendent of all psychedelics.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I don't know how many times now,</v>

924
00:35:30.950 --> 00:35:32.810
<v Speaker 3>but every time I do it I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh fuck.</v>

925
00:35:32.811 --> 00:35:34.010
<v Speaker 3>Here I go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get nervous.</v>

926
00:35:34.011 --> 00:35:37.770
<v Speaker 3>I'm white knuckling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Before you take that hand of the pipe,</v>

927
00:35:37.771 --> 00:35:39.510
<v Speaker 3>you go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

00:35:41.940 --> 00:35:43.020
<v Speaker 3>it just takes one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here we go.</v>

929
00:35:43.620 --> 00:35:44.700
<v Speaker 3>Three hits,</v>
<v Speaker 3>three heads,</v>

930
00:35:44.701 --> 00:35:46.780
<v Speaker 3>three minutes is what I recommend.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Deep on.</v>

931
00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:50.810
<v Speaker 3>Blow it out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go in again.</v>

932
00:35:51.350 --> 00:35:55.020
<v Speaker 3>I can't just do one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to get to the door.</v>

933
00:35:55.170 --> 00:35:57.000
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to get you to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

934
00:35:57.001 --> 00:35:58.290
<v Speaker 3>you know you play Ding Dong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ditch,</v>

935
00:35:58.350 --> 00:35:59.800
<v Speaker 3>bring someone's doorbell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>runaway.</v>

936
00:35:59.860 --> 00:36:00.693
<v Speaker 3>You can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You gotta you gotta you gotta open up </v>

937
00:36:02.071 --> 00:36:03.220
<v Speaker 3>the door and you got to get into the </v>
<v Speaker 3>house.</v>

938
00:36:04.140 --> 00:36:04.960
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

939
00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:06.000
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's amazing.</v>

940
00:36:06.600 --> 00:36:08.780
<v Speaker 3>How does it make you shit yourself?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Until I'm like,</v>

941
00:36:08.781 --> 00:36:09.090
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

942
00:36:09.090 --> 00:36:11.940
<v Speaker 3>like the tea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The problem with the t is that your body</v>

943
00:36:11.941 --> 00:36:16.941
<v Speaker 3>rejects your purging the bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's my argument.</v>

944
00:36:18.241 --> 00:36:18.571
<v Speaker 3>You like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

945
00:36:18.571 --> 00:36:20.640
<v Speaker 3>you're just throwing up and shitting </v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself because you had the shit.</v>

946
00:36:20.730 --> 00:36:22.890
<v Speaker 3>You shouldn't have eight to del Taco </v>
<v Speaker 3>before he fucking took it.</v>

947
00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:24.473
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you definitely are supposed to alter </v>

948
00:36:25.231 --> 00:36:26.064
<v Speaker 3>your diet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You definitely suppose to have an </v>

949
00:36:27.811 --> 00:36:28.644
<v Speaker 3>alkaline diet before you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A sense that you're going to fucking </v>

950
00:36:30.991 --> 00:36:32.340
<v Speaker 3>blow your backside out because they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

951
00:36:32.341 --> 00:36:33.960
<v Speaker 3>you need a fast before you come into </v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

952
00:36:34.130 --> 00:36:34.730
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not,</v>

953
00:36:34.730 --> 00:36:37.710
<v Speaker 3>you purge it now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bad energy that's you fucking purge out.</v>

954
00:36:37.770 --> 00:36:38.770
<v Speaker 3>Just the shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

955
00:36:38.771 --> 00:36:39.331
<v Speaker 3>Eight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

956
00:36:39.331 --> 00:36:43.500
<v Speaker 3>this is like hippy dippy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>new age way of talking where people go,</v>

957
00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:44.970
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the toxins.</v>

958
00:36:45.390 --> 00:36:47.700
<v Speaker 3>You're getting rid of the toxins,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the toxins,</v>

959
00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:51.240
<v Speaker 3>like they do that and yoga all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you're in this position,</v>

960
00:36:51.390 --> 00:36:54.580
<v Speaker 3>this position releases toxins.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It,</v>

961
00:36:54.620 --> 00:36:57.510
<v Speaker 3>it clears your body of all the emotions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

962
00:36:57.511 --> 00:36:59.370
<v Speaker 3>you're stretching.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shut the fuck up.</v>

963
00:36:59.430 --> 00:37:00.900
<v Speaker 3>And with this dot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is d.</v>

964
00:37:00.901 --> 00:37:02.400
<v Speaker 3>You're not purging,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you sweating.</v>

965
00:37:02.680 --> 00:37:05.250
<v Speaker 3>If you're sweating,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your body's getting rid of some fluid.</v>

966
00:37:05.251 --> 00:37:07.830
<v Speaker 3>There's definitely so a cleansing </v>
<v Speaker 3>process involved in that.</v>

967
00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:10.350
<v Speaker 3>There's no fucking toxins like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>come on,</v>

968
00:37:10.380 --> 00:37:14.040
<v Speaker 3>stop with the toxins.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At least we're on the same page.</v>

969
00:37:14.130 --> 00:37:15.870
<v Speaker 3>It's just do drugs and have fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

970
00:37:15.920 --> 00:37:16.620
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

971
00:37:16.620 --> 00:37:19.170
<v Speaker 3>I WASCO is dmt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what it is,</v>

972
00:37:19.171 --> 00:37:21.840
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's an orally active version of dnt.</v>

973
00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:24.480
<v Speaker 3>I'll give you the quick breakdown.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your body produces,</v>

974
00:37:24.481 --> 00:37:28.530
<v Speaker 3>your gut produces something called model</v>
<v Speaker 3>aiming oxidase and you,</v>

975
00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:32.310
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what it is is it breaks down dmt.</v>

976
00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:33.233
<v Speaker 3>So if you eat like grass,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like there's certain types of grasses </v>

977
00:37:35.611 --> 00:37:37.440
<v Speaker 3>and lettuce and a bunch of different </v>
<v Speaker 3>plans,</v>

978
00:37:37.441 --> 00:37:39.540
<v Speaker 3>like thousands of different plants have </v>
<v Speaker 3>dmt in them,</v>

979
00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:40.493
<v Speaker 3>but you don't trip when you eat him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The reason why is because your stomach </v>

980
00:37:42.631 --> 00:37:44.910
<v Speaker 3>produces something called Monell amy and</v>
<v Speaker 3>oxidase.</v>

981
00:37:45.150 --> 00:37:47.070
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these indigenous people in the Amazon,</v>

982
00:37:47.190 --> 00:37:49.740
<v Speaker 3>they figured out how to combine one </v>
<v Speaker 3>plant,</v>

983
00:37:49.741 --> 00:37:50.574
<v Speaker 3>which has dmt in it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then another plant which has an Mao </v>

984
00:37:53.251 --> 00:37:54.084
<v Speaker 3>inhibitor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this Mao inhibitor inhibits your </v>

985
00:37:56.191 --> 00:38:00.840
<v Speaker 3>body's production of monoamine oxidase.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so the DMT naturally absorbs in your</v>

986
00:38:00.841 --> 00:38:03.660
<v Speaker 3>body,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're eating these fucked up plants</v>

987
00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:06.780
<v Speaker 3>that tastes like shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It tastes like a total dick.</v>

988
00:38:06.810 --> 00:38:07.643
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you just,</v>

989
00:38:08.220 --> 00:38:10.110
<v Speaker 3>you're just throwing up and shitting </v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself.</v>

990
00:38:10.510 --> 00:38:11.343
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's supposed to be an incredible </v>

991
00:38:12.271 --> 00:38:13.920
<v Speaker 3>spiritual experience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven't done it.</v>

992
00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:17.490
<v Speaker 3>I've only done the the way stronger </v>
<v Speaker 3>version of it,</v>

993
00:38:17.610 --> 00:38:18.443
<v Speaker 3>which you smoke,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which doesn't give you any throwing up </v>

994
00:38:20.251 --> 00:38:22.650
<v Speaker 3>any diarrhea and which sounds way </v>
<v Speaker 3>better.</v>

995
00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:24.210
<v Speaker 3>It's way better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's gotta be,</v>

996
00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:26.220
<v Speaker 3>I think the other ones really amazing </v>
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>

997
00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:30.480
<v Speaker 3>But the thing about the DMT thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they called the businessman's trip cause</v>

998
00:38:30.481 --> 00:38:32.520
<v Speaker 3>you're in and out in 15 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's perfect,</v>

999
00:38:32.540 --> 00:38:36.100
<v Speaker 3>but I amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you're not</v>

1000
00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:36.993
<v Speaker 4>no hung over.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're good transient drugs ever </v>

1001
00:38:40.840 --> 00:38:43.240
<v Speaker 4>exhibited or ever observed in the human </v>
<v Speaker 4>body.</v>

1002
00:38:43.450 --> 00:38:46.690
<v Speaker 4>Your body brings you back to baseline </v>
<v Speaker 4>really quickly.</v>

1003
00:38:46.691 --> 00:38:48.710
<v Speaker 4>So you're high as a fucking car.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You,</v>

1004
00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:50.310
<v Speaker 4>you're in the center of the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're,</v>

1005
00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:51.153
<v Speaker 4>you're talking to dee geometric patterns</v>
<v Speaker 4>that are made out of love and </v>

1006
00:38:55.241 --> 00:38:56.074
<v Speaker 4>understanding and know everything about </v>
<v Speaker 4>everything you've ever done your whole </v>

1007
00:38:58.031 --> 00:39:02.830
<v Speaker 4>life and recognize your bullshit and </v>
<v Speaker 4>dissolve your ego right in front of you.</v>

1008
00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:04.660
<v Speaker 4>Show you your life in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>

1009
00:39:04.661 --> 00:39:05.494
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in like these hieroglyphs and show you </v>

1010
00:39:07.991 --> 00:39:11.830
<v Speaker 4>these insane images that are made out of</v>
<v Speaker 4>like neon with no borders.</v>

1011
00:39:12.010 --> 00:39:13.960
<v Speaker 4>And then 15 minutes later your cowboy </v>
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>

1012
00:39:14.620 --> 00:39:16.120
<v Speaker 4>but you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're renewed.</v>

1013
00:39:16.300 --> 00:39:19.150
<v Speaker 4>It's like resetting your whole </v>
<v Speaker 4>experience.</v>

1014
00:39:19.151 --> 00:39:21.040
<v Speaker 4>Man's planet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man sold me.</v>

1015
00:39:21.100 --> 00:39:22.360
<v Speaker 4>It's going to be your friend.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You explain that?</v>

1016
00:39:22.361 --> 00:39:24.970
<v Speaker 4>I wish I could explain my diving that </v>
<v Speaker 4>good cause I was just like,</v>

1017
00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:28.180
<v Speaker 4>oh you fucking go in and break some </v>
<v Speaker 4>other gas.</v>

1018
00:39:28.180 --> 00:39:29.930
<v Speaker 4>And I think he did a great job.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It,</v>

1019
00:39:30.180 --> 00:39:31.480
<v Speaker 4>I think you did a great job explaining </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

1020
00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:34.300
<v Speaker 4>But I think there's a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a bunch of factors going on.</v>

1021
00:39:34.301 --> 00:39:35.134
<v Speaker 4>I think like with your life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like all the good things that are </v>

1022
00:39:36.461 --> 00:39:37.294
<v Speaker 4>happening is I think first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a decision to go to one 70 is a very </v>

1023
00:39:40.241 --> 00:39:41.800
<v Speaker 4>good one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So here I'm uh,</v>

1024
00:39:41.940 --> 00:39:43.350
<v Speaker 4>I'm uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I get upset.</v>

1025
00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:46.330
<v Speaker 4>I think the number one problem we have </v>
<v Speaker 4>in fighting today,</v>

1026
00:39:46.390 --> 00:39:48.370
<v Speaker 4>the number one problem is weight </v>
<v Speaker 4>cutting.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Do I stop this one?</v>

1080
00:41:55.480 --> 00:41:59.370
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

00:42:02.490 --> 00:42:03.323
<v Speaker 4>Friday night work because he had did an </v>
<v Speaker 4>acoustic version of it too is kind of </v>

1083
00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:12.753
<v Speaker 4>Jammy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why I kicked his ass and kicking </v>

1084
00:42:18.030 --> 00:42:23.030
<v Speaker 4>out the same people on the train.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You were with me.</v>

1085
00:42:24.421 --> 00:42:25.254
<v Speaker 4>They were like an eye out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's probably listening to both see and </v>

1086
00:42:27.260 --> 00:42:32.260
<v Speaker 4>kicking it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We'll see in the morning.</v>

1087
00:42:34.060 --> 00:42:38.160
<v Speaker 4>Was He in the night?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Get into a fight.</v>

1088
00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:44.070
<v Speaker 4>Right for you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's perfect song and it's perfect.</v>

1089
00:42:44.100 --> 00:42:44.940
<v Speaker 4>I loved it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1090
00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:47.210
<v Speaker 4>It was just quiet in the change room.</v>

1091
00:42:47.670 --> 00:42:49.800
<v Speaker 3>We're be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck?</v>

1092
00:42:51.220 --> 00:42:52.630
<v Speaker 3>It was good man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's awesome.</v>

1093
00:42:52.750 --> 00:42:53.583
<v Speaker 3>I think to UFC and MMA in general should</v>
<v Speaker 3>make a concerted effort to stop weight </v>

1094
00:42:57.431 --> 00:42:58.540
<v Speaker 3>cutting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just stop it,</v>

1095
00:42:58.541 --> 00:42:59.374
<v Speaker 3>stop it dead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Say No more and and just eliminate it </v>

1096
00:43:01.781 --> 00:43:02.614
<v Speaker 3>completely and I think it can be done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it can be done if you have just </v>

1097
00:43:06.671 --> 00:43:09.610
<v Speaker 3>set up good fights between guys that are</v>
<v Speaker 3>the same size.</v>

1098
00:43:09.960 --> 00:43:11.050
<v Speaker 3>This,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think this,</v>

1099
00:43:11.051 --> 00:43:14.800
<v Speaker 3>this whole obsession with like </v>
<v Speaker 3>championship belts on them with you.</v>

1100
00:43:14.950 --> 00:43:16.510
<v Speaker 3>It's all great and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But like,</v>

1101
00:43:16.511 --> 00:43:17.344
<v Speaker 3>here's the perfect example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>conor and nate diaz biggest fucking </v>

1102
00:43:19.691 --> 00:43:23.260
<v Speaker 3>fight in the history of the sport.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No belt on the lot.</v>

1103
00:43:23.320 --> 00:43:24.880
<v Speaker 3>That just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just throwing down,</v>

1104
00:43:24.910 --> 00:43:27.130
<v Speaker 3>nobody gave a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody said where's the gold?</v>

1105
00:43:27.430 --> 00:43:28.450
<v Speaker 3>Where's the strap?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1106
00:43:28.451 --> 00:43:29.284
<v Speaker 3>Where's the leather?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he feels like EOC is going more </v>

1107
00:43:31.031 --> 00:43:32.800
<v Speaker 3>towards big fights in his championship </v>
<v Speaker 3>fights.</v>

1108
00:43:32.820 --> 00:43:35.350
<v Speaker 3>I hope that's what they did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hope so.</v>

1109
00:43:35.430 --> 00:43:38.780
<v Speaker 3>Till they just take the guys that want </v>
<v Speaker 3>to on a seat.</v>

1110
00:43:39.340 --> 00:43:41.720
<v Speaker 3>Can you announce that fight that fight?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The no,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I can't.</v>

1112
00:43:43.480 --> 00:43:48.200
<v Speaker 3>It's not 100% yet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's going to be fucking ruined.</v>

1113
00:43:49.190 --> 00:43:50.460
<v Speaker 3>Ruined.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's a good,</v>

1114
00:43:53.050 --> 00:43:55.480
<v Speaker 3>hopefully today we get the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we get the double thumbs up.</v>

<v Speaker 3>last night we got the half the thumb.</v>

1116

<v Speaker 3>So you gotta have to have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you already have them up like a pose </v>

1119
00:44:06.521 --> 00:44:07.840
<v Speaker 3>could potentially be mad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1120

<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 3>himself.</v>

1384
00:54:42.450 --> 00:54:44.850
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm playing a video game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was in the mode for sure.</v>

1385
00:54:44.851 --> 00:54:45.810
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>

1386
00:54:46.380 --> 00:54:47.670
<v Speaker 3>That's a matrix.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shit.</v>

1387
00:54:47.790 --> 00:54:48.623
<v Speaker 3>I mean this to me is more impressive </v>
<v Speaker 3>than when Anderson Silva knocked out </v>

1388
00:54:51.931 --> 00:54:52.764
<v Speaker 3>forrest griffin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause when Anderson Silva knocked out </v>

1389
00:54:54.391 --> 00:54:55.224
<v Speaker 3>forrest Griffin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I know about forest was at forest </v>

1390
00:54:57.331 --> 00:54:58.710
<v Speaker 3>was compromised going into that fight.</v>

1391
00:54:58.710 --> 00:55:00.600
<v Speaker 3>He had been knocked out twice in </v>
<v Speaker 3>training camp.</v>

1392
00:55:00.780 --> 00:55:03.570
<v Speaker 3>He had a real hard time taking shots and</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably shouldn't have been in there in</v>

1393
00:55:03.571 --> 00:55:07.830
<v Speaker 3>the first place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so he had a lot of doubts and he was</v>

1394
00:55:07.831 --> 00:55:12.180
<v Speaker 3>having a real hard time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a big powerful rick story.</v>

1395
00:55:12.270 --> 00:55:15.540
<v Speaker 3>Who's a nasty motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He throws vicious body shots.</v>

1396
00:55:15.550 --> 00:55:18.690
<v Speaker 3>He's a hard wrestler.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's the guy who was the first loss that</v>

1397
00:55:18.691 --> 00:55:22.020
<v Speaker 3>Johnny Hendricks got.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People don't know Rick Story.</v>

1398
00:55:22.170 --> 00:55:23.003
<v Speaker 3>Rick story's a tough dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And for you to tee off on him like this </v>

1399
00:55:25.920 --> 00:55:26.753
<v Speaker 3>in this perfect way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not with big wound up fucking heavy </v>

1400
00:55:30.691 --> 00:55:31.524
<v Speaker 3>shots like he throws with Rick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Story likes to do is you pressures guys </v>

1401
00:55:34.590 --> 00:55:37.710
<v Speaker 3>and he fucking digs in or I'm wound to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the body,</v>

1402
00:55:37.860 --> 00:55:39.360
<v Speaker 3>takes you down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>beats you up.</v>

1403
00:55:39.480 --> 00:55:40.313
<v Speaker 3>He's a tough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tough dude and what you did is you just </v>

1404
00:55:42.931 --> 00:55:44.310
<v Speaker 3>use perfect technique.</v>

1405
00:55:44.400 --> 00:55:47.020
<v Speaker 3>That angle when you throw that left,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you throw the LE,</v>

1406
00:55:47.170 --> 00:55:48.810
<v Speaker 3>you throw the Left,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Jab,</v>

1407
00:55:48.870 --> 00:55:52.340
<v Speaker 3>you throw the right hand to the body and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you take that Washes Jab.</v>

1408
00:55:52.370 --> 00:55:54.510
<v Speaker 3>Well he bought that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like taking it.</v>

1409
00:55:54.740 --> 00:55:56.310
<v Speaker 3>He did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Boom.</v>

1410
00:55:56.320 --> 00:55:59.910
<v Speaker 3>That was all like you adjusted,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you adjusted perfectly with that left.</v>

1411
00:55:59.960 --> 00:56:02.520
<v Speaker 3>He tried to be nice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tried to be nice about yourself.</v>

1412
00:56:03.150 --> 00:56:04.570
<v Speaker 3>Look at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a beautiful combination.</v>

1413
00:56:05.400 --> 00:56:06.233
<v Speaker 3>That's a matrix shit and I feel like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>big part of that is you not depleting </v>

1414
00:56:09.961 --> 00:56:11.100
<v Speaker 3>your body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>

1415
00:56:11.490 --> 00:56:13.290
<v Speaker 3>Another big part of his is one 70 </v>
<v Speaker 3>pounders.</v>

1416
00:56:13.291 --> 00:56:14.124
<v Speaker 3>Don't think you can just come take my </v>
<v Speaker 3>body shots anymore because I don't like </v>

1417
00:56:16.020 --> 00:56:21.020
<v Speaker 3>I let them more biscuit now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1420
00:56:24.310 --> 00:56:25.143
<v Speaker 1>What did your body feel like when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>fought one 55 like when you compare </v>

1421
00:56:28.181 --> 00:56:29.014
<v Speaker 1>yourself to a normal training session,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like say you're several months in </v>

1422
00:56:32.801 --> 00:56:33.634
<v Speaker 1>between fights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I walk around one s I used to walk </v>

1423
00:56:36.071 --> 00:56:36.904
<v Speaker 1>around and bout one 74 right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was like my deep training camp and </v>

1424
00:56:41.231 --> 00:56:45.940
<v Speaker 1>I noticed when I started to cut I'd get </v>
<v Speaker 1>down to one 6,870</v>

1425
00:56:45.941 --> 00:56:48.610
<v Speaker 1>but I had nothing in the gas tank man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would always be like,</v>

1426
00:56:49.060 --> 00:56:50.740
<v Speaker 1>it would all mental at that point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

<v Speaker 1>thin and brittle and one 70 I feel good.</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1430
00:56:59.350 --> 00:57:02.140
<v Speaker 1>I don't feel like it's a big part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I have no experience in this.</v>

1438
00:57:21.100 --> 00:57:23.800
<v Speaker 1>I should get back on once when I was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>kid cause I read huckleberry Finn.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Give it a go.</v>

1445
00:57:36.570 --> 00:57:38.560
<v Speaker 1>What do you do with it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just take a little bump.</v>

1446
00:57:38.561 --> 00:57:41.140
<v Speaker 1>Put under your lip bump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Little Pinch.</v>

<v Speaker 1>but what about alcohol?</v>

1497

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

00:59:43.640 --> 00:59:46.360
<v Speaker 1>talk about kills a lot of people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't talk about.</v>

1499
00:59:46.370 --> 00:59:46.731
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1503
00:59:51.441 --> 00:59:52.190
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have them.</v>

1504
00:59:52.190 --> 00:59:53.580
<v Speaker 1>See why they wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if the,</v>

1505
00:59:53.610 --> 00:59:55.880
<v Speaker 1>you'll voc Copenhagen right in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>middle of the octagon.</v>

1506
00:59:56.510 --> 00:59:58.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So man,</v>

1507
00:59:59.450 --> 01:00:01.670
<v Speaker 1>people already get mad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's hilarious.</v>

1508
01:00:01.671 --> 01:00:05.720
<v Speaker 1>And people get mad that Nate Diaz was </v>
<v Speaker 1>smoking a vape pen after his fight.</v>

1509
01:00:06.120 --> 01:00:06.953
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just watched him get punched in the </v>

1510
01:00:08.271 --> 01:00:09.104
<v Speaker 1>fucking head for 25 minutes and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>think it's bad that he's smoking a vape </v>

1511
01:00:14.301 --> 01:00:15.134
<v Speaker 1>pen.</v>

1512
01:00:15.740 --> 01:00:17.300
<v Speaker 1>You want to hear the problem with it </v>
<v Speaker 1>though?</v>

1513
01:00:17.630 --> 01:00:18.381
<v Speaker 1>What's the problem?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1514
01:00:18.381 --> 01:00:19.214
<v Speaker 1>there's no problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you sought a contest up to 42 hours </v>

1515
01:00:22.131 --> 01:00:23.000
<v Speaker 1>after we fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1516
01:00:23.001 --> 01:00:25.880
<v Speaker 1>So it might be a bad call on him because</v>
<v Speaker 1>just because,</v>

1517
01:00:27.050 --> 01:00:29.390
<v Speaker 1>only that would be the only bad downfall</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

1518
01:00:29.391 --> 01:00:30.770
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's totally doing it publicly.</v>

1519
01:00:30.771 --> 01:00:32.960
<v Speaker 1>He could probably get tested immediately</v>
<v Speaker 1>right after.</v>

1520
01:00:33.170 --> 01:00:34.003
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thing is that the one he was taken </v>

1521
01:00:34.910 --> 01:00:38.390
<v Speaker 1>with cbd oil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is not psychoactive,</v>

1522
01:00:38.450 --> 01:00:41.600
<v Speaker 1>which I'm a totally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>totally fan of.</v>

1523
01:00:41.740 --> 01:00:43.620
<v Speaker 1>That's all I take.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you take cbd with Tom?</v>

1524
01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:45.290
<v Speaker 1>I'd put the patches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used the rub.</v>

1525
01:00:45.560 --> 01:00:46.371
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he said there's no </v>

1526
01:00:46.371 --> 01:00:48.290
<v Speaker 1>hallucinogenic effects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just did the healing,</v>

1527
01:00:48.350 --> 01:00:50.080
<v Speaker 1>the medicinal side of the marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1528
01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:50.811
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1529
01:00:50.811 --> 01:00:51.890
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whenever I go to Colorado,</v>

1530
01:00:51.891 --> 01:00:52.724
<v Speaker 1>I load up on another cbd oils and I use </v>
<v Speaker 1>them all the time for my knees and my </v>

1531
01:00:56.001 --> 01:00:56.470
<v Speaker 1>elbows.</v>

1532
01:00:56.470 --> 01:00:58.070
<v Speaker 1>You can use in a bath,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1533
01:00:58.300 --> 01:01:00.480
<v Speaker 1>I have some ointment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You put it in the sauce.</v>

1534
01:01:00.600 --> 01:01:01.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's bath,</v>

1535
01:01:01.580 --> 01:01:05.840
<v Speaker 1>but it's really a bath salts for real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is this?</v>

1536
01:01:06.870 --> 01:01:11.810
<v Speaker 1>The size of that joint parties with </v>
<v Speaker 1>snoop and the biggest joint ever.</v>

1537
01:01:11.811 --> 01:01:14.120
<v Speaker 1>That is not the biggest joint ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is propaganda.</v>

1538
01:01:14.121 --> 01:01:16.550
<v Speaker 1>I've seen the biggest joint ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's far bigger than that.</v>

1539
01:01:16.730 --> 01:01:18.410
<v Speaker 1>I'm a big supporter of both of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>gentlemen,</v>

1540
01:01:18.411 --> 01:01:21.050
<v Speaker 1>but I don't like lying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a pretty big joint.</v>

1541
01:01:21.051 --> 01:01:25.970
<v Speaker 1>That floor me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not the biggest joint over looked</v>

1542
01:01:25.971 --> 01:01:26.804
<v Speaker 1>in this audit box right here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now was in there creeping around </v>

1543
01:01:27.980 --> 01:01:28.840
<v Speaker 1>earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh look,</v>

1545
01:01:31.970 --> 01:01:36.140
<v Speaker 1>Chewing I'm drinking is to see what </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens when you combine the two of them</v>

1546
01:01:36.141 --> 01:01:37.160
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The three of them,</v>

1547
01:01:37.770 --> 01:01:39.950
<v Speaker 1>the three of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a fucking American.</v>

1548
01:01:40.250 --> 01:01:42.320
<v Speaker 1>I'm a grown man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A middle aged.</v>

1549
01:01:42.410 --> 01:01:44.270
<v Speaker 1>I have children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a wife.</v>

1550
01:01:44.300 --> 01:01:45.133
<v Speaker 1>I pay taxes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got a lot of good pr things on my </v>

1551
01:01:48.951 --> 01:01:49.880
<v Speaker 1>side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you,</v>

1552
01:01:49.881 --> 01:01:50.870
<v Speaker 1>change lives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1553
01:01:50.871 --> 01:01:53.690
<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't be the people that listen </v>
<v Speaker 1>to this.</v>

1554
01:01:53.691 --> 01:01:54.524
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this might be a terrible episode for </v>

1555
01:01:57.021 --> 01:01:59.990
<v Speaker 1>people to tell them to model their life </v>
<v Speaker 1>after,</v>

1556
01:01:59.991 --> 01:02:00.824
<v Speaker 1>but typically you talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you talk about good health and eating </v>

1557
01:02:04.581 --> 01:02:08.840
<v Speaker 1>correctly and just people that sit </v>
<v Speaker 1>around and do nothing with their lives.</v>

1558
01:02:08.841 --> 01:02:09.674
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just getting up on a Sunday and going </v>

1559
01:02:10.821 --> 01:02:11.780
<v Speaker 1>for a hike and getting out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1560
01:02:11.781 --> 01:02:14.780
<v Speaker 1>you talked about these things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they enjoy it.</v>

1561
01:02:16.430 --> 01:02:17.263
<v Speaker 1>I get messages every day from people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that lost a hundred pounds right there </v>

1562
01:02:19.240 --> 01:02:20.073
<v Speaker 1>feeling healthy.</v>

1563
01:02:20.550 --> 01:02:21.383
<v Speaker 3>The problem is we're dealing with </v>
<v Speaker 3>propaganda and you could do one or two </v>

1564
01:02:23.911 --> 01:02:25.770
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could either just say,</v>

01:02:25.771 --> 01:02:27.610
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know this is this,</v>

1566

<v Speaker 3>I was wondering why I'm so hot.</v>

1571
01:02:40.650 --> 01:02:45.650
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what I'm doing right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>too and drank and so,</v>

<v Speaker 3>What happens if you swallow it?</v>

1574
01:02:51.840 --> 01:02:54.330
<v Speaker 3>New Rule.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jb pulls up something immediately.</v>

1575
01:02:54.570 --> 01:02:55.403
<v Speaker 3>New lives enforced by the food and Drug </v>
<v Speaker 3>Administration will prevent cigarettes </v>

1576
01:02:58.171 --> 01:03:02.430
<v Speaker 3>and smokeless tobacco sponsorships in </v>
<v Speaker 3>sporting events that smoking tobacco.</v>

1577
01:03:02.460 --> 01:03:04.410
<v Speaker 3>I think that's the vape pens or are </v>

<v Speaker 3>I swallowed it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there was a couple of years ago,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I'm enjoying this.</v>

1585
01:03:21.720 --> 01:03:24.000
<v Speaker 3>I might,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I might incorporate this in my diet.</v>

1586
01:03:24.300 --> 01:03:26.550
<v Speaker 3>What did we start selling on it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tobacco pills.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I love it.</v>

1594
01:03:47.900 --> 01:03:50.820
<v Speaker 3>That might be the best way to go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fucking,</v>

1595
01:03:50.821 --> 01:03:51.740
<v Speaker 3>hey rose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The thing,</v>

1596
01:03:52.170 --> 01:03:53.003
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>

1597
01:03:53.170 --> 01:03:56.310
<v Speaker 3>we're here for a hundred years if we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>lucky.</v>

1598
01:03:56.370 --> 01:03:57.840
<v Speaker 3>Lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And along the way,</v>

1599
01:03:57.930 --> 01:04:02.430
<v Speaker 3>we're having a deal with decades and </v>
<v Speaker 3>decades of propaganda,</v>

1600
01:04:02.490 --> 01:04:03.323
<v Speaker 3>which are lies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just lives we were dealing with </v>

1601
01:04:05.221 --> 01:04:10.221
<v Speaker 3>lies by all these different people that </v>
<v Speaker 3>profited off of demonization,</v>

1602
01:04:10.231 --> 01:04:11.064
<v Speaker 3>of marijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and having people think that there's </v>

1603
01:04:12.871 --> 01:04:15.840
<v Speaker 3>something bad about consuming these </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychedelic drugs.</v>

1604
01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:18.150
<v Speaker 3>These things have made me more </v>
<v Speaker 3>sensitive.</v>

1605
01:04:18.151 --> 01:04:18.984
<v Speaker 3>They may be nicer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They made me more aware of my impact on </v>

1606
01:04:22.411 --> 01:04:23.244
<v Speaker 3>the people that are in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>More kind and more appreciative of the </v>

1607
01:04:26.581 --> 01:04:27.414
<v Speaker 3>people that are in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>More appreciative and more thankful for </v>

1608
01:04:30.121 --> 01:04:32.880
<v Speaker 3>all the lucky things that have happened </v>
<v Speaker 3>to me.</v>

<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1636
01:05:37.721 --> 01:05:40.060

<v Speaker 3>people protest it,</v>

1654
01:06:18.160 --> 01:06:20.260
<v Speaker 3>which is really ironic because one of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the things,</v>

1655
01:06:20.261 --> 01:06:21.760
<v Speaker 3>we're going to kill a bear,</v>
<v Speaker 3>any Predator,</v>

1656
01:06:21.761 --> 01:06:22.810
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a Predator,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a hunter,</v>

1657
01:06:23.110 --> 01:06:26.320
<v Speaker 3>but if you're going to kill a predator,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking get down and dirty with it.</v>

1658
01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:28.240
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he got down and dirty.</v>

1659
01:06:28.590 --> 01:06:29.830
<v Speaker 3>So you had to be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

1660
01:06:30.190 --> 01:06:32.440
<v Speaker 3>five feet from it with a spear?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he was,</v>

1661
01:06:32.500 --> 01:06:33.640
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a huge dude.</v>

01:06:33.641 --> 01:06:36.520
<v Speaker 3>His name's Josh bonior.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll just give him a shout out and a,</v>

1663
01:06:36.521 --> 01:06:37.354
<v Speaker 3>this is what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Josh bowmore killed his bear with a </v>

1664
01:06:39.041 --> 01:06:41.650
<v Speaker 3>spear and they put the video online like</v>
<v Speaker 3>did he,</v>

1665
01:06:41.651 --> 01:06:43.370
<v Speaker 3>did he treat it first or no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1666
01:06:43.371 --> 01:06:43.631
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

1667
01:06:43.631 --> 01:06:44.464
<v Speaker 3>It was at a bait site in Alberta.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was there the week before I was </v>

1668
01:06:46.541 --> 01:06:47.930
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was their hunting the week afterward.</v>

1669
01:06:47.950 --> 01:06:48.950
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1670
01:06:49.150 --> 01:06:51.650
<v Speaker 3>and he got within 16 feet of this bear </v>
<v Speaker 3>and fuck,</v>

1671
01:06:51.670 --> 01:06:52.503
<v Speaker 3>maybe 16 yards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He got closest fucked to this bear and </v>

1672
01:06:55.061 --> 01:06:55.894
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he is like a competitive javelin </v>

1673
01:06:57.311 --> 01:06:58.540
<v Speaker 3>thrower.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a huge dude.</v>

1674
01:06:58.541 --> 01:06:59.650
<v Speaker 3>He's a bodybuilder.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

1675
01:07:00.160 --> 01:07:02.440
<v Speaker 3>He chucks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his spear hits the bear,</v>

1676
01:07:02.470 --> 01:07:04.570
<v Speaker 3>the bear run 60 yards and dies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1677
01:07:04.571 --> 01:07:06.850
<v Speaker 3>But there's a video of it and the bears </v>
<v Speaker 3>guts are hanging out.</v>

1678
01:07:06.850 --> 01:07:09.250
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like hunting scenes or graphic,</v>

1679
01:07:09.251 --> 01:07:10.150
<v Speaker 3>just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1680
01:07:10.180 --> 01:07:11.013
<v Speaker 3>everybody likes to have those five guys </v>
<v Speaker 3>burgers but nobody wants to go to the </v>

1681
01:07:13.151 --> 01:07:13.984
<v Speaker 3>fucking slaughterhouse and watch them </v>
<v Speaker 3>get hit in the head with a piston then </v>

1682
01:07:15.791 --> 01:07:16.624
<v Speaker 3>gutted and hung by their ankles and </v>
<v Speaker 3>twitching and spraying all over the </v>

1683
01:07:19.511 --> 01:07:20.344
<v Speaker 3>place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's the reality of the world we </v>

1684
01:07:21.611 --> 01:07:22.220
<v Speaker 3>live in in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1685
01:07:22.220 --> 01:07:24.430
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not 100% you know,</v>

1686
01:07:24.431 --> 01:07:25.264
<v Speaker 3>saying that the v I don't think putting </v>
<v Speaker 3>the video up is a good idea because if </v>

1687
01:07:29.141 --> 01:07:30.390
<v Speaker 3>you're going to put a video like that </v>
<v Speaker 3>up,</v>

1688
01:07:31.190 --> 01:07:32.023
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot you got explain for hours.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your position on a whole lot of things </v>

1689
01:07:35.861 --> 01:07:37.360
<v Speaker 3>for anybody is going to accept that </v>
<v Speaker 3>video.</v>

1690
01:07:37.990 --> 01:07:39.400
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>under armor,</v>

1691
01:07:39.580 --> 01:07:41.830
<v Speaker 3>which was a sponsor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they sponsored his wife,</v>

1692
01:07:42.310 --> 01:07:43.143
<v Speaker 3>they canceled her sponsorship cause she </v>
<v Speaker 3>was filming the hunt and then they're </v>

1693
01:07:46.091 --> 01:07:50.050
<v Speaker 3>getting this huge backlash from all of </v>
<v Speaker 3>these hunters who were like,</v>

1694
01:07:50.051 --> 01:07:53.140
<v Speaker 3>well this is a legal hunt because it was</v>
<v Speaker 3>legal to do that in Alberta.</v>

1695
01:07:53.260 --> 01:07:56.020
<v Speaker 3>And everybody always says like if they </v>
<v Speaker 3>talk about hunters,</v>

1696
01:07:56.050 --> 01:07:56.681
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you pussy,</v>

1697
01:07:56.681 --> 01:07:59.560
<v Speaker 3>you think you're fucking man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go kill him with the spirit or knife.</v>

1698
01:07:59.650 --> 01:08:00.483
<v Speaker 3>This guy did it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fucking killed a seven foot bear with a </v>

1699
01:08:03.131 --> 01:08:05.140
<v Speaker 3>spear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't do it.</v>

1700
01:08:05.320 --> 01:08:06.153
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying there's a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 3>problems with it as far as like a </v>

1701
01:08:08.801 --> 01:08:10.330
<v Speaker 3>regular person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like first of all,</v>

1702
01:08:10.331 --> 01:08:11.164
<v Speaker 3>you gotta be strong as fuck to throw a </v>
<v Speaker 3>spear hard enough to kill a bear or if </v>

1703
01:08:14.411 --> 01:08:16.520
<v Speaker 3>you're not you to be close enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1704
01:08:17.090 --> 01:08:19.910
<v Speaker 3>A couple of those things are those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those are both huge factors.</v>

1705
01:08:20.050 --> 01:08:22.610
<v Speaker 3>You're taking a tremendous risk doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that,</v>

1706
01:08:22.940 --> 01:08:27.590
<v Speaker 3>so it gets out of the realm in a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>people's eyes of like hunting for meat,</v>

1707
01:08:27.620 --> 01:08:29.630
<v Speaker 3>which is really the only thing that </v>
<v Speaker 3>people respect.</v>

1708
01:08:30.230 --> 01:08:33.320
<v Speaker 3>If the average person doesn't hunt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they do not respect trophy animals.</v>

1709
01:08:33.500 --> 01:08:35.240
<v Speaker 3>The trophy hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rather if you say,</v>

1710
01:08:35.241 --> 01:08:36.210
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want a,</v>

1711
01:08:36.290 --> 01:08:38.420
<v Speaker 3>I want a zebra rug,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I'm going to shoot a zebra.</v>

1712
01:08:38.570 --> 01:08:39.403
<v Speaker 3>People who get fucking pissed at u of o </v>
<v Speaker 3>is wanting to see a stuffed giraffe in </v>

1713
01:08:42.451 --> 01:08:43.284
<v Speaker 3>my backyard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People will get fucking really mad at </v>

1714
01:08:45.171 --> 01:08:47.510
<v Speaker 3>you if you kill an animal for its skin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

1715
01:08:47.690 --> 01:08:48.523
<v Speaker 3>If you kill an animal for the sole </v>
<v Speaker 3>purpose of eating it and you'd do it in </v>

1716
01:08:50.871 --> 01:08:53.520
<v Speaker 3>an ethical way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people they,</v>

1717
01:08:53.660 --> 01:08:54.201
<v Speaker 3>they go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1718
01:08:54.201 --> 01:08:55.034
<v Speaker 3>I get it because I eat meat myself and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>buy fish from the store and there's 95% </v>

1719
01:08:58.761 --> 01:09:02.210
<v Speaker 3>of the planet does that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But this guy who got it,</v>

1720
01:09:02.211 --> 01:09:03.044
<v Speaker 3>there's a huge controversy with armour </v>
<v Speaker 3>and one of the things that Jason </v>

1721
01:09:05.780 --> 01:09:06.860
<v Speaker 3>Harrison from quill,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you said,</v>

1722
01:09:06.861 --> 01:09:09.200
<v Speaker 3>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't outsource our credibility.</v>

1723

<v Speaker 3>I don't think there's anything wrong </v>

1768
01:11:04.041 --> 01:11:04.874
<v Speaker 3>with the gay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think people are too fucking </v>

1769
01:11:07.011 --> 01:11:10.190
<v Speaker 3>connected to an article of clothing and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're doing it for one reason.</v>

1770
01:11:10.760 --> 01:11:15.420
<v Speaker 3>One reason does the only reason into </v>
<v Speaker 3>that tradition because the guys with the</v>

1771
01:11:15.421 --> 01:11:19.020
<v Speaker 3>Geeky know how to use that fucking Geek </v>

1848
01:14:26.471 --> 01:14:29.630

01:14:33.610 --> 01:14:38.610
<v Speaker 3>This one's done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gone in like levels of uh,</v>

1850
01:14:39.040 --> 01:14:39.820
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1851
01:14:39.820 --> 01:14:40.653
<v Speaker 3>you see levels of everything in sport </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think that's one of the things </v>

1852
01:14:42.641 --> 01:14:43.510
<v Speaker 3>you're showing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1853
01:14:43.810 --> 01:14:45.550
<v Speaker 3>I think you're showing a level of </v>
<v Speaker 3>kickboxing.</v>

1854
01:14:45.560 --> 01:14:47.410
<v Speaker 3>There's a very fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you,</v>

1855
01:14:47.530 --> 01:14:49.330
<v Speaker 3>you're hitting those kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 3>combinations.</v>

1856
01:14:49.390 --> 01:14:54.320
<v Speaker 3>Now I believe in my wrestling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's the big key in the coat.</v>

1857
01:14:54.321 --> 01:14:55.900
<v Speaker 3>A fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in the rick story fight,</v>

1858
01:14:55.901 --> 01:14:58.330
<v Speaker 3>you took both those guys down and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think they were probably like,</v>

1859
01:14:58.420 --> 01:14:59.500
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1860
01:14:59.770 --> 01:15:00.760
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I mean,</v>

1861
01:15:00.761 --> 01:15:03.340
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the competence in my takedown defense is</v>

1862
01:15:03.341 --> 01:15:07.510
<v Speaker 3>allowing me to really open up and </v>
<v Speaker 3>believing in myself is really,</v>

1863
01:15:08.020 --> 01:15:09.370
<v Speaker 3>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I reinvented myself,</v>

1864
01:15:09.371 --> 01:15:10.690
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just started like,</v>

1865
01:15:10.691 --> 01:15:13.270
<v Speaker 3>when someone comes into the gym,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm fucking you up.</v>

1866
01:15:13.470 --> 01:15:14.330
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You come down Jackson,</v>

1867
01:15:14.340 --> 01:15:16.390
<v Speaker 3>I'm beating your motherfucking ass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I understand.</v>

1868
01:15:16.420 --> 01:15:19.000
<v Speaker 3>So it's just accept the fact you're not </v>
<v Speaker 3>sparring.</v>

1869
01:15:19.600 --> 01:15:21.980
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anymore.</v>

1870
01:15:23.050 --> 01:15:27.850
<v Speaker 3>Back in the day when you come in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you come in and we do mma rounds,</v>

1871
01:15:27.851 --> 01:15:28.900
<v Speaker 3>I'm fucking you up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1872
01:15:29.170 --> 01:15:30.160
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

1873
01:15:30.760 --> 01:15:31.593
<v Speaker 3>I see it like somehow figured out how do</v>
<v Speaker 3>I translate that into fight night </v>

1874
01:15:34.211 --> 01:15:35.044
<v Speaker 3>because so many emotions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this last fight I was the worst I've </v>

1875
01:15:38.741 --> 01:15:39.880
<v Speaker 3>ever felt in my whole life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1876
01:15:39.881 --> 01:15:42.100
<v Speaker 3>I talked about that with Megan after the</v>
<v Speaker 3>fight.</v>

1877
01:15:42.130 --> 01:15:42.963
<v Speaker 3>I had the worst headache and was looking</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jimmy really sick all day before this </v>

1878
01:15:46.541 --> 01:15:48.070
<v Speaker 3>last fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you,</v>

1879
01:15:48.400 --> 01:15:49.450
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Greg Jackson's like,</v>

1880
01:15:49.451 --> 01:15:51.670
<v Speaker 3>cowboy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is what you train for every day.</v>

1881
01:15:51.700 --> 01:15:54.290
<v Speaker 3>This has to be somebody on your worst </v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

1882
01:15:54.360 --> 01:15:56.020
<v Speaker 3>is what you had to be prepared for it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1883
01:15:56.320 --> 01:15:58.540
<v Speaker 3>and Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck.</v>

1884
01:15:58.541 --> 01:16:00.610
<v Speaker 3>It was just warming up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't feel it.</v>

1885
01:16:00.730 --> 01:16:02.770
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't until we started walking out </v>
<v Speaker 3>that I was like,</v>

1886
01:16:02.771 --> 01:16:05.020
<v Speaker 3>fucking Kelvin this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>find the mother fucking gear.</v>

1887
01:16:05.020 --> 01:16:05.681
<v Speaker 3>Let's go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1888
01:16:05.681 --> 01:16:09.100
<v Speaker 3>and had just had to get it this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's,</v>

1889
01:16:09.150 --> 01:16:09.983
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a legit question that I asked </v>

1890
01:16:11.231 --> 01:16:13.300
<v Speaker 3>you in the last podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

1891
01:16:13.301 --> 01:16:14.020
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Div,</v>

1892
01:16:14.020 --> 01:16:16.510
<v Speaker 3>you ever talked to a mental coach?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You ever work with a mental coach?</v>

1893
01:16:16.870 --> 01:16:17.830
<v Speaker 3>And you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck no,</v>

1894
01:16:18.200 --> 01:16:20.680
<v Speaker 3>I just go out there and kick some ass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He blows it.</v>

1895
01:16:20.930 --> 01:16:23.460
<v Speaker 3>He buzzy and kicking ass it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1896
01:16:23.770 --> 01:16:25.870
<v Speaker 3>which I think is very admirable and it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>fun,</v>

1897
01:16:26.110 --> 01:16:28.400
<v Speaker 3>but I think you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're at this,</v>

1898
01:16:28.820 --> 01:16:29.950
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's this,</v>

1899
01:16:30.040 --> 01:16:33.490
<v Speaker 3>there's this crust of the elite of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>elite right now,</v>

1900
01:16:33.491 --> 01:16:36.010
<v Speaker 3>and you're at that crust.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think in that,</v>

1901
01:16:36.190 --> 01:16:37.023
<v Speaker 3>that top echelon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you get up there with the best of </v>

1902
01:16:40.091 --> 01:16:40.924
<v Speaker 3>the best,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think there's any room for </v>

1903
01:16:43.960 --> 01:16:46.630
<v Speaker 3>potential.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it all should be played out.</v>

1904
01:16:46.870 --> 01:16:47.703
<v Speaker 3>You should,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you should have realized your potential </v>

1905
01:16:49.390 --> 01:16:51.490
<v Speaker 3>as much as possible by the time you got </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

1906
01:16:51.730 --> 01:16:52.563
<v Speaker 3>And I think a factor in that is mindset.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I don't think it's just being tough </v>

1907
01:16:56.861 --> 01:16:57.694
<v Speaker 3>and going out there and kicking ass </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you've already got that down to </v>

1908
01:17:00.071 --> 01:17:01.300
<v Speaker 3>a science.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's you.</v>

1909
01:17:01.570 --> 01:17:04.690
<v Speaker 3>I think there are some strategies and </v>
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

1910
01:17:04.691 --> 01:17:05.524
<v Speaker 3>there are also some tools that you can </v>
<v Speaker 3>use in terms of mental management that </v>

1911
01:17:09.171 --> 01:17:10.004
<v Speaker 3>keep you in the proper channels and </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't allow your mind to wander so you </v>

1912
01:17:13.311 --> 01:17:15.150
<v Speaker 3>don't have to bring your mind back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1913
01:17:15.290 --> 01:17:16.160
<v Speaker 3>And say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>

1914
01:17:16.161 --> 01:17:17.570
<v Speaker 3>I don't think about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's just,</v>

1915
01:17:17.571 --> 01:17:19.070
<v Speaker 3>we're here for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is what we came for.</v>

1916
01:17:19.160 --> 01:17:20.600
<v Speaker 3>You don't need that pep talk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1917
01:17:20.690 --> 01:17:22.550
<v Speaker 3>Because you never go down that bad </v>
<v Speaker 3>channel.</v>

1918
01:17:22.940 --> 01:17:24.890
<v Speaker 3>You're always staying in these positive </v>
<v Speaker 3>channels.</v>

1919
01:17:24.980 --> 01:17:26.960
<v Speaker 3>And the thoughts come in like they do </v>
<v Speaker 3>with anybody.</v>

1920
01:17:26.961 --> 01:17:29.060
<v Speaker 3>Like when I meditate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I get in a tank,</v>

1921
01:17:29.180 --> 01:17:31.280
<v Speaker 3>people think you just go in there and </v>
<v Speaker 3>use zen out.</v>

1922
01:17:31.460 --> 01:17:33.380
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I start thinking about stupid shit.</v>

1923
01:17:33.590 --> 01:17:35.980
<v Speaker 3>I thought I started thinking about God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I gotta clean my fucking office.</v>

1924
01:17:35.990 --> 01:17:37.550
<v Speaker 3>I'm such a Slob.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1925
01:17:37.551 --> 01:17:38.230
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1926
01:17:38.230 --> 01:17:39.063
<v Speaker 3>a little things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You start thinking dumb shit and put it </v>

1927
01:17:41.610 --> 01:17:46.010
<v Speaker 3>down and take them back in and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and mental coat.</v>

1928
01:17:46.040 --> 01:17:47.450
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to connect you to vinny </v>
<v Speaker 3>shoreman.</v>

1929
01:17:47.810 --> 01:17:49.790
<v Speaker 3>Vinny shoreman is the guy that works </v>
<v Speaker 3>with Joe Schilling.</v>

1930
01:17:50.150 --> 01:17:51.200

<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1935
01:18:02.110 --> 01:18:04.250
<v Speaker 3>I think you would get along with him </v>
<v Speaker 3>just because of that.</v>

<v Speaker 3>So when it comes to understanding how </v>

1939
01:18:13.191 --> 01:18:14.024
<v Speaker 3>the mind works,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the tricks you can play on you and how </v>

<v Speaker 3>bad decisions from the past can fuck </v>
<v Speaker 3>with you in,</v>

1941
01:18:19.441 --> 01:18:20.274
<v Speaker 3>in terms of like bad things sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>define you and you've got to figure out </v>

<v Speaker 3>a way to alleviate yourself from an,</v>

01:18:50.180 --> 01:18:53.240
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] that were recorded by him in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the jungle.</v>

1950
01:18:54.160 --> 01:18:56.060
<v Speaker 3>It goes deep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck.</v>

1951
01:18:56.240 --> 01:18:58.100
<v Speaker 3>It goes deep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what I think,</v>

1952
01:18:58.190 --> 01:18:59.023
<v Speaker 3>I think you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think you're already coaching </v>

1953
01:19:01.551 --> 01:19:04.910
<v Speaker 3>yourself by this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like reinventing yourself,</v>

1954
01:19:04.911 --> 01:19:05.420
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1955
01:19:05.420 --> 01:19:08.330
<v Speaker 3>Reevaluating your diet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>starting to add supplementation,</v>

1956
01:19:08.331 --> 01:19:09.164
<v Speaker 3>taking care of yourself better,</v>
<v Speaker 3>approaching things in a more </v>

1957
01:19:10.611 --> 01:19:12.310
<v Speaker 3>professional way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cutting out the sparring,</v>

1958
01:19:12.320 --> 01:19:15.440
<v Speaker 3>working entirely on drilling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you were seeing all these results.</v>

1959
01:19:15.650 --> 01:19:18.080
<v Speaker 3>Choosing to go to one 70 and be </v>
<v Speaker 3>healthier when you're fighting,</v>

1960
01:19:18.230 --> 01:19:21.500
<v Speaker 3>you're seeing all these results.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All of these results are like this.</v>

1961
01:19:21.501 --> 01:19:24.500
<v Speaker 3>Gravitation towards improvement and </v>
<v Speaker 3>advancement.</v>

1962
01:19:24.740 --> 01:19:27.950
<v Speaker 3>And I think that there's a thing that </v>
<v Speaker 3>men have and I'm guilty of it.</v>

1963
01:19:28.010 --> 01:19:29.060
<v Speaker 3>We all are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1964
01:19:29.061 --> 01:19:30.990
<v Speaker 3>we don't want help.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why women rise.</v>

1965
01:19:31.060 --> 01:19:34.100
<v Speaker 3>Like men don't want direction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know where I'm gone.</v>

1966
01:19:34.460 --> 01:19:35.630
<v Speaker 3>Don't worry about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1967
01:19:35.631 --> 01:19:36.464
<v Speaker 3>it's classic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My wife does it all the time and I know </v>

1968
01:19:37.521 --> 01:19:40.010
<v Speaker 3>where I'm going sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not even exactly sure,</v>

1969
01:19:40.060 --> 01:19:40.893
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what I know is I don't want to hear </v>

1970
01:19:41.781 --> 01:19:44.870
<v Speaker 3>her tell me where I'm going because if I</v>
<v Speaker 3>was just driving on my own,</v>

1971
01:19:44.900 --> 01:19:46.670
<v Speaker 3>I'd figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it would be no problem.</v>

1972
01:19:46.790 --> 01:19:48.090
<v Speaker 3>But when someone doesn't think you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>fee,</v>

1973
01:19:48.290 --> 01:19:49.123
<v Speaker 3>it's like men have a real issue with um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with being coached on things that could </v>

1974
01:19:56.601 --> 01:19:58.730
<v Speaker 3>be potentially thought of his </v>
<v Speaker 3>weaknesses.</v>

1975
01:19:58.780 --> 01:19:59.613
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like men don't want to go to like a </v>

1976
01:20:00.441 --> 01:20:02.990
<v Speaker 3>couple's counseling and have some other </v>
<v Speaker 3>dude tell,</v>

1977
01:20:03.070 --> 01:20:06.020
<v Speaker 3>tell you how to communicate better with </v>
<v Speaker 3>your woman or your man,</v>

1978
01:20:06.050 --> 01:20:06.930
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever your,</v>

1979
01:20:07.180 --> 01:20:08.013
<v Speaker 3>your man,</v>

1980
01:20:08.740 --> 01:20:10.770
<v Speaker 4>I can't guys go to cal can't go down </v>
<v Speaker 4>that path.</v>

1981
01:20:10.771 --> 01:20:11.604
<v Speaker 4>That's what it was like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got a peek and I drank too much </v>

1982
01:20:16.450 --> 01:20:20.760
<v Speaker 4>American house.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Go ahead cause I'm glad you left.</v>

1983
01:20:20.761 --> 01:20:22.720
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what the fuck I was saying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was going,</v>

1984
01:20:23.120 --> 01:20:25.320
<v Speaker 4>I was killing out about something </v>
<v Speaker 4>completely preposterous.</v>

1985
01:20:25.680 --> 01:20:28.680
<v Speaker 4>What was I saying?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1986
01:20:29.310 --> 01:20:32.040
<v Speaker 4>we have a men have a do have a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1988
01:20:37.051 --> 01:20:37.884
<v Speaker 4>mistakes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You are your fault and you are your </v>

1989
01:20:39.631 --> 01:20:40.920
<v Speaker 4>weaknesses.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they,</v>

1990
01:20:40.980 --> 01:20:41.813
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they get branded into your system and </v>

<v Speaker 4>system,</v>

1992
01:20:46.261 --> 01:20:47.094

<v Speaker 4>you sort of define yourself not by the </v>

1993
01:20:50.821 --> 01:20:52.800
<v Speaker 4>lessons you've learned from those </v>
<v Speaker 4>experiences.</v>

<v Speaker 4>based on your past and you can go </v>

<v Speaker 4>impulsive and I could mess my whole life</v>

<v Speaker 1>where would you buzz your head?</v>

2067
01:23:44.111 --> 01:23:45.810
<v Speaker 1>You'd shave it all and you'd let it grow</v>
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>

2068
01:23:45.860 --> 01:23:47.350

<v Speaker 1>I'm going to those sites all the time.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You could not,</v>

2108
01:25:28.540 --> 01:25:29.950
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't just go get somebody off the </v>

<v Speaker 1>the shows?</v>

2120
01:25:57.370 --> 01:25:59.380
<v Speaker 1>I've been to a lot of your shows and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone's always like,</v>

2121
01:25:59.870 --> 01:26:01.060
<v Speaker 1>do you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you ask people,</v>

2122

<v Speaker 1>what do you want to type in there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

2125
01:26:04.070 --> 01:26:05.020
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's,</v>

2126
01:26:05.360 --> 01:26:06.710
<v Speaker 3>I just tell them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go on youtube.</v>

2127
01:26:06.740 --> 01:26:07.610
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go on Youtube.</v>

2128
01:26:07.640 --> 01:26:08.473
<v Speaker 3>I can't talk about any more and there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing funny I could say about it </v>

2129
01:26:10.671 --> 01:26:11.504
<v Speaker 3>either and it's definitely not something</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd see in front of a giant crowd of </v>

2130
01:26:13.311 --> 01:26:14.630
<v Speaker 3>people where they're going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>understand.</v>

2131
01:26:14.780 --> 01:26:15.613
<v Speaker 3>I try to explain Doug's stand old paddle</v>
<v Speaker 3>whole bit once cause I got him high on </v>

2132
01:26:18.351 --> 01:26:21.650
<v Speaker 3>DMT and blew his mind and he went and </v>
<v Speaker 3>did a whole bit about,</v>

2133
01:26:21.890 --> 01:26:25.520
<v Speaker 3>about me and him doing dmt in my house.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought he was dead.</v>

2134
01:26:25.670 --> 01:26:28.910
<v Speaker 3>He was moaning and foaming like </v>
<v Speaker 3>legitimately foaming at the mouth.</v>

2135
01:26:29.060 --> 01:26:32.450
<v Speaker 3>He was aligned down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gone for 15 minutes.</v>

2136
01:26:32.750 --> 01:26:33.583
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a solid three of moaning with a </v>

2137
01:26:36.861 --> 01:26:38.840
<v Speaker 3>point where I'm going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh boy.</v>

2138
01:26:38.870 --> 01:26:40.340
<v Speaker 3>He was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe he was just purging.</v>

2139
01:26:40.460 --> 01:26:42.050
<v Speaker 3>Well I just started thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what did I do?</v>

2140
01:26:42.140 --> 01:26:44.390
<v Speaker 3>Like I made doug do what I do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

2141
01:26:44.420 --> 01:26:45.170
<v Speaker 3>So I'm thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

2142
01:26:45.170 --> 01:26:46.850
<v Speaker 3>he'll be fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why I'm not doing what you do.</v>

2143
01:26:46.851 --> 01:26:47.684
<v Speaker 3>You say three giant hits,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to do what you want and a </v>

2144
01:26:50.560 --> 01:26:51.470
<v Speaker 3>half.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's my point.</v>

2145
01:26:51.500 --> 01:26:53.900
<v Speaker 3>You fucking healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Doug.</v>

2146
01:26:53.901 --> 01:26:56.270
<v Speaker 3>Stan hope smokes two packs of cigarettes</v>
<v Speaker 3>a day.</v>

2147
01:26:56.450 --> 01:26:58.190
<v Speaker 3>He gets up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>starts drinking,</v>

2148
01:26:58.191 --> 01:27:02.730
<v Speaker 3>stops when he falls asleep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So now it matters of your,</v>

2149
01:27:02.800 --> 01:27:04.700
<v Speaker 3>your physical,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2150
01:27:04.701 --> 01:27:07.970
<v Speaker 3>I just think what was going on and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>wasn't bad for him.</v>

2151
01:27:07.971 --> 01:27:09.200
<v Speaker 3>He came back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was fine.</v>

2152
01:27:09.230 --> 01:27:12.470
<v Speaker 3>It's a natural drug that is in the human</v>
<v Speaker 3>body.</v>

2153
01:27:12.620 --> 01:27:15.860
<v Speaker 3>You don't overdose from it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one's ever died from smoking.</v>

2154
01:27:15.861 --> 01:27:18.020
<v Speaker 3>DMT done dmt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean when a lot,</v>

2155
01:27:18.780 --> 01:27:19.613
<v Speaker 3>how can we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how can we have there now that for your </v>

2156
01:27:22.190 --> 01:27:23.023
<v Speaker 3>pumps,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't have a very big audience of </v>

2157
01:27:24.921 --> 01:27:25.790
<v Speaker 3>people that can pull it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>

2158
01:27:25.791 --> 01:27:26.460
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

2159
01:27:26.460 --> 01:27:31.250
<v Speaker 3>you've definitely oded on lsd or on </v>
<v Speaker 3>alcohol.</v>

2160
01:27:31.280 --> 01:27:33.140
<v Speaker 3>This is what I think without being </v>
<v Speaker 3>irresponsible.</v>

2161
01:27:33.170 --> 01:27:35.480
<v Speaker 3>I think that if you have any </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychological issues,</v>

2162
01:27:35.481 --> 01:27:38.300
<v Speaker 3>you probably shouldn't do anything that </v>
<v Speaker 3>perturbs your,</v>

2163
01:27:38.301 --> 01:27:39.134
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>

2164
01:27:39.200 --> 01:27:40.170
<v Speaker 3>your state,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your stuff.</v>

2165
01:27:40.180 --> 01:27:44.720
<v Speaker 3>So I should not do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm fucking crazy batshit crazy.</v>

2166
01:27:45.260 --> 01:27:48.800
<v Speaker 3>But I think that saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just saying that getting out of the way,</v>

2167
01:27:49.130 --> 01:27:53.000
<v Speaker 3>it could benefit a whole lot of people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a whole lot of people that could</v>

2168
01:27:53.001 --> 01:27:54.710
<v Speaker 3>benefit from it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I'm saying.</v>

2169
01:27:54.890 --> 01:27:56.530
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think just for me,</v>

2170
01:27:56.610 --> 01:27:59.030
<v Speaker 3>I'm going in as a way to do it through </v>
<v Speaker 3>Kundalini Yoga.</v>

2171
01:27:59.031 --> 01:28:00.620
<v Speaker 3>Apparently you do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2172
01:28:00.621 --> 01:28:01.660

<v Speaker 3>He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2176
01:28:08.250 --> 01:28:09.083
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kinda does what Eddie used to do where </v>

2177
01:28:10.341 --> 01:28:15.341
<v Speaker 3>he recognizes what they do is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're filming a certain positions.</v>

2178
01:28:15.740 --> 01:28:17.750
<v Speaker 3>Like when Damien Maia finished Carlos </v>
<v Speaker 3>Condit,</v>

2179
01:28:17.751 --> 01:28:18.440
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2180
01:28:18.440 --> 01:28:21.170
<v Speaker 3>we need to be marked Ella grotto when </v>
<v Speaker 3>telegraph tase out,</v>

2181
01:28:21.390 --> 01:28:22.460
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>d uh,</v>

2182
01:28:22.520 --> 01:28:25.130
<v Speaker 3>denny will fill in the place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he understands the transitions.</v>

2183
01:28:25.190 --> 01:28:27.520
<v Speaker 3>So he'll pull that clip up for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>replays.</v>

2184
01:28:27.970 --> 01:28:28.760
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2185
01:28:28.760 --> 01:28:29.593
<v Speaker 3>denny is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a big proponent of Kundalini Yoga and </v>

2186
01:28:32.781 --> 01:28:34.670
<v Speaker 3>he's also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's done dmt.</v>

2187
01:28:34.940 --> 01:28:37.880
<v Speaker 3>And when he does Quinn Delaney,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he can achieve those states.</v>

2188
01:28:37.881 --> 01:28:39.170
<v Speaker 3>How?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

2189
01:28:39.171 --> 01:28:41.210
<v Speaker 3>I don't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kundolini I've never done it,</v>

2190
01:28:41.390 --> 01:28:42.223
<v Speaker 3>but it's a fungus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Coon Dalene Eenie Rimini is a series of </v>

2191
01:28:44.451 --> 01:28:45.284
<v Speaker 3>exercises and meditations and yoga that </v>
<v Speaker 3>are widely purported to achieve </v>

2192
01:28:50.571 --> 01:28:51.404
<v Speaker 3>psychedelic states.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's other ways to do it to this </v>

2193
01:28:53.640 --> 01:28:54.473
<v Speaker 3>hollow holotropic breathing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's like a psychedelic breathing </v>

2194
01:28:57.081 --> 01:29:02.081
<v Speaker 3>method that you can do that can see DMT </v>
<v Speaker 3>is produced the human body.</v>

2195
01:29:02.400 --> 01:29:04.320
<v Speaker 3>So you just got to get your body to make</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

2196
01:29:04.740 --> 01:29:06.240
<v Speaker 3>And so there's this sense that somehow </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

2197
01:29:06.241 --> 01:29:07.074
<v Speaker 3>there's ways that people have figured </v>
<v Speaker 3>out where you can stimulate your body's </v>

2198
01:29:10.501 --> 01:29:12.840
<v Speaker 3>production of his natural psychedelic </v>
<v Speaker 3>chemical.</v>

2199
01:29:12.900 --> 01:29:16.790
<v Speaker 3>So not just through taking it </v>
<v Speaker 3>exogenously like smoking it or,</v>

2200
01:29:16.960 --> 01:29:21.230
<v Speaker 3>or drinking it when you're taken Iowasca</v>
<v Speaker 3>but to make your home body produce it.</v>

2201
01:29:21.240 --> 01:29:22.073
<v Speaker 3>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the reason behind it is for near </v>

2202
01:29:24.541 --> 01:29:25.231
<v Speaker 3>death experience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2203
01:29:25.231 --> 01:29:27.270
<v Speaker 3>Does that make you feel okay?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2204
01:29:27.271 --> 01:29:30.810
<v Speaker 3>What's the reason behind it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like I've experienced what you're</v>

2205
01:29:30.811 --> 01:29:32.220
<v Speaker 3>talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I almost died,</v>

2206
01:29:32.880 --> 01:29:35.030
<v Speaker 3>everything I was seeing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the most pain I've ever been in.</v>

2207
01:29:35.970 --> 01:29:37.950
<v Speaker 3>I tipped the Garney over,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking threw a ball,</v>

2208
01:29:37.951 --> 01:29:38.784
<v Speaker 3>his blood,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they put me back and then all of a </v>

2209
01:29:39.601 --> 01:29:43.020
<v Speaker 3>sudden it's like overwhelming film </v>
<v Speaker 3>feeling just overtook me.</v>

2210
01:29:43.021 --> 01:29:45.750
<v Speaker 3>And everything was just okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I was okay to die.</v>

2211
01:29:45.780 --> 01:29:47.790
<v Speaker 3>It was craziest feeling I've ever had.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like everything was,</v>

2212
01:29:48.450 --> 01:29:49.740
<v Speaker 3>I had neck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2213
01:29:50.400 --> 01:29:53.730
<v Speaker 3>no fear and I had no worries in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>

2214
01:29:53.731 --> 01:29:54.564
<v Speaker 3>Everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was just like,</v>

2215
01:29:54.780 --> 01:29:55.613
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like everything was just like a giant </v>

2216
01:29:56.971 --> 01:29:57.300
<v Speaker 3>ease.</v>

2217
01:29:57.300 --> 01:29:59.400
<v Speaker 3>It lifted off me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've heard of that before.</v>

2218
01:29:59.550 --> 01:30:01.590
<v Speaker 3>I haven't had that experience but I've </v>
<v Speaker 3>heard that before.</v>

2219
01:30:01.830 --> 01:30:02.663
<v Speaker 3>Well don't try and die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a friend almost died in a car </v>

2220
01:30:04.801 --> 01:30:09.030
<v Speaker 3>accident and she said the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She said right after the car hit and she</v>

2221
01:30:09.031 --> 01:30:09.864
<v Speaker 3>got smashed by this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this car slamming it like take got t </v>

2222
01:30:13.021 --> 01:30:13.854
<v Speaker 3>boned,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she flew across the other side of the </v>

2223
01:30:16.111 --> 01:30:16.944
<v Speaker 3>car.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's smashed into her friend and there </v>

2224
01:30:18.751 --> 01:30:22.050
<v Speaker 3>was this immediate like feeling of </v>
<v Speaker 3>peace.</v>

2225
01:30:22.470 --> 01:30:24.430
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so media is feeling of like everything's</v>

2226
01:30:24.431 --> 01:30:27.420
<v Speaker 3>going to be all right in this weird love</v>
<v Speaker 3>sensation.</v>

2227
01:30:27.720 --> 01:30:30.120
<v Speaker 3>I didn't see any geographic shapes </v>
<v Speaker 3>telling me,</v>

2228
01:30:30.590 --> 01:30:31.423
<v Speaker 3>well you cause you were knocking on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>door so then you kind of go and sneak </v>

2229
01:30:33.030 --> 01:30:33.863
<v Speaker 3>out and get it event.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that's what the worry is that when </v>

2230
01:30:38.671 --> 01:30:41.340
<v Speaker 3>you're doing dmt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you're seeing is the afterlife.</v>

2231
01:30:41.550 --> 01:30:42.383
<v Speaker 3>And you're seeing that there is some </v>
<v Speaker 3>place that the soul goes and that the </v>

2232
01:30:45.241 --> 01:30:50.150
<v Speaker 3>soul is not just a concept that's based </v>
<v Speaker 3>in mysticism and lies and fantasies,</v>

2233
01:30:50.151 --> 01:30:52.130
<v Speaker 3>myths and lies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2234
01:30:52.140 --> 01:30:54.540
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of people look at things </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you can't prove.</v>

2235
01:30:54.570 --> 01:30:55.480
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's right.</v>

2236
01:30:55.700 --> 01:30:56.990
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the big word,</v>

2237
01:30:57.030 --> 01:30:57.863
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if you look at something like a </v>

2238
01:30:58.501 --> 01:30:59.580
<v Speaker 3>soul,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you can't prove it.</v>

2239
01:30:59.610 --> 01:31:01.020
<v Speaker 3>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't prove it.</v>

2240
01:31:01.290 --> 01:31:04.830
<v Speaker 3>Definitely we all agree on that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But let's examine what the fuck it means</v>

2241
01:31:04.831 --> 01:31:07.150
<v Speaker 3>to be a person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't know what it,</v>

2242
01:31:07.160 --> 01:31:07.993
<v Speaker 3>what it means to be conscious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's all these ways we can define it </v>

2243
01:31:10.801 --> 01:31:11.634
<v Speaker 3>and talk about it where it makes sense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it does not make sense that you are </v>

2244
01:31:14.161 --> 01:31:14.994
<v Speaker 3>looking through your eyes and live in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the life of Donald's Roney and I'm </v>

2245
01:31:17.611 --> 01:31:18.444
<v Speaker 3>looking through my eyes and I'm living </v>
<v Speaker 3>the life of Joe Rogan and we've become </v>

2246
01:31:21.121 --> 01:31:22.520
<v Speaker 3>pals and we have stories.</v>

2247
01:31:22.550 --> 01:31:26.130
<v Speaker 3>We talk and you say things with your </v>
<v Speaker 3>mouth and icon to understand what you're</v>

2248
01:31:26.131 --> 01:31:26.964
<v Speaker 3>saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I say things and I hope you </v>

2249
01:31:28.081 --> 01:31:29.700
<v Speaker 3>understand what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we,</v>

2250
01:31:29.720 --> 01:31:31.150
<v Speaker 3>we laugh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have a good time.</v>

2251
01:31:31.151 --> 01:31:31.984
<v Speaker 3>And drink a few budweiser.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like this is a fucking bizarre </v>

2252
01:31:34.021 --> 01:31:39.021
<v Speaker 3>state to be clinging to a circular ball </v>
<v Speaker 3>like some gigantic,</v>

2253
01:31:40.231 --> 01:31:41.064
<v Speaker 3>huge pack of water and dirt and rock </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's hurling through infinity with </v>

2254
01:31:45.841 --> 01:31:49.500
<v Speaker 3>scis seven others.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so strange.</v>

2255
01:31:49.800 --> 01:31:52.170
<v Speaker 3>It's just strange.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It can be life.</v>

2256
01:31:52.171 --> 01:31:53.004
<v Speaker 3>Is waste stranger or as strange as </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything you're going to experience on </v>

2257
01:31:55.771 --> 01:31:57.600
<v Speaker 3>DMT.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We just used to live.</v>

2258
01:31:58.110 --> 01:32:00.160
<v Speaker 3>I like life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like life to life</v>

2259
01:32:00.160 --> 01:32:01.570
<v Speaker 4>is awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what,</v>

2260
01:32:01.571 --> 01:32:02.950
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's talk about space.</v>

2261
01:32:03.940 --> 01:32:05.290
<v Speaker 4>Let's go there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's do it.</v>

2262
01:32:05.291 --> 01:32:06.100
<v Speaker 4>What do you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>

2263
01:32:06.100 --> 01:32:09.940
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck is out there man?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean everything.</v>

2264
01:32:10.060 --> 01:32:12.820
<v Speaker 4>So I talked to Bj Penn.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He thinks the world is flying.</v>

2265
01:32:12.910 --> 01:32:15.310
<v Speaker 4>I understand this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How would this crazy,</v>

2266
01:32:15.311 --> 01:32:16.144
<v Speaker 4>is that right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He believes the world is flat and that </v>

2267
01:32:19.060 --> 01:32:22.180
<v Speaker 4>when you take off in an airplane,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you just do like a big,</v>

2268
01:32:22.660 --> 01:32:26.380
<v Speaker 4>you don't go around the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You just kind of do like a boom.</v>

2269
01:32:26.740 --> 01:32:27.910
<v Speaker 4>Here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>

2270
01:32:28.090 --> 01:32:30.590
<v Speaker 4>Why would anybody lie about that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I where's the,</v>

2271
01:32:30.600 --> 01:32:32.830
<v Speaker 4>where's the money in line about the </v>
<v Speaker 4>earth being flat?</v>

2272
01:32:33.040 --> 01:32:34.660
<v Speaker 4>It's so stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So stupid.</v>

2273
01:32:34.720 --> 01:32:35.553
<v Speaker 4>It's so stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He thinks Columbia Columbus might've </v>

2274
01:32:37.151 --> 01:32:38.350
<v Speaker 4>been onto something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Listen man,</v>

<v Speaker 4>physics like you or me.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I don't understand physics or night </v>
<v Speaker 4>comes down to when you sail around the </v>

2279
01:32:50.441 --> 01:32:52.330
<v Speaker 4>world.</v>

<v Speaker 4>You're just kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what do you just hit a wall?</v>

2283
01:33:00.491 --> 01:33:01.324
<v Speaker 4>Like every image shown by NASA is a </v>
<v Speaker 4>composite of that's exactly actually </v>

2284
01:33:05.730 --> 01:33:07.390

<v Speaker 4>station lying.</v>

2288
01:33:14.171 --> 01:33:16.450
<v Speaker 4>Every Russian,</v>
<v Speaker 4>every American,</v>

2289
01:33:16.540 --> 01:33:20.110
<v Speaker 4>they're all a bunch of liars.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you baby girl Illuminati.</v>

2290
01:33:20.190 --> 01:33:21.023
<v Speaker 4>You're not stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is to think that everyone has been </v>

2291
01:33:22.361 --> 01:33:24.700
<v Speaker 4>faking every image of the earth being </v>
<v Speaker 4>round.</v>

2292
01:33:24.880 --> 01:33:28.100
<v Speaker 4>Oh and coincidentally the earth is the </v>
<v Speaker 4>only flat thing we've ever found.</v>

2293
01:33:28.110 --> 01:33:30.130
<v Speaker 4>The fucking universe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cause all the moons,</v>

2294
01:33:30.250 --> 01:33:31.870
<v Speaker 4>all the planets,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jupiter,</v>

2295
01:33:31.960 --> 01:33:33.280
<v Speaker 4>all that shit's round as fuck.</v>

2296
01:33:34.390 --> 01:33:36.250
<v Speaker 4>What's that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>These are tree stumps by the way.</v>

2297
01:33:36.490 --> 01:33:40.270
<v Speaker 4>According to the flat earth theory,</v>
<v Speaker 4>every giant rock were being trolled.</v>

2298
01:33:40.330 --> 01:33:41.440
<v Speaker 4>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is not real.</v>

2299
01:33:41.650 --> 01:33:43.280
<v Speaker 4>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a trees down.</v>

2300
01:33:43.360 --> 01:33:47.440
<v Speaker 4>How big would that treat is a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>an elaborate four chan host.</v>

2301
01:33:47.620 --> 01:33:51.220
<v Speaker 4>There's slowly trolling America.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2302
01:33:52.020 --> 01:33:54.490
<v Speaker 4>like Pandora size tree does definitely </v>
<v Speaker 4>make sense,</v>

2303
01:33:54.491 --> 01:33:55.630
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow,</v>

2304
01:33:55.730 --> 01:33:57.010
<v Speaker 4>that's legit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And what happened to it?</v>

2305
01:33:57.140 --> 01:33:58.640
<v Speaker 4>I got knock,</v>
<v Speaker 4>knock.</v>

2306
01:33:58.641 --> 01:34:02.800
<v Speaker 4>I know about the dinosaurs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't think the reality,</v>

2307
01:34:03.280 --> 01:34:06.760
<v Speaker 4>the reality of earth and space is crazy </v>
<v Speaker 4>enough.</v>

2308
01:34:06.761 --> 01:34:10.810
<v Speaker 4>You dump cunts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't have to fake conspiracies.</v>

2309
01:34:10.930 --> 01:34:15.490
<v Speaker 4>The reality of this whole thing is so </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking Uber Bizarre.</v>

2310
01:34:15.670 --> 01:34:20.110
<v Speaker 4>We're in a giant ball that's floating in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the sky.</v>

2311
01:34:20.560 --> 01:34:23.290
<v Speaker 4>Above us is something a quarter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The size of us,</v>

2312
01:34:23.440 --> 01:34:24.273
<v Speaker 4>it's floating in the sky and it doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>even fucking spin and you need it there </v>

2313
01:34:27.970 --> 01:34:32.740
<v Speaker 4>and it regulates the tides and if it was</v>
<v Speaker 4>any further or any closer,</v>

2314
01:34:32.770 --> 01:34:36.010
<v Speaker 4>everybody we'd be dead.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's crazy.</v>

2315
01:34:36.160 --> 01:34:36.993
<v Speaker 4>That itself is fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't have to pretend you're seeing </v>

2316
01:34:39.401 --> 01:34:40.234
<v Speaker 4>trees.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't have to pretend the earth is </v>

2317
01:34:41.471 --> 01:34:43.180
<v Speaker 4>flat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You fucking retards.</v>

2318
01:34:43.270 --> 01:34:45.730
<v Speaker 4>That doesn't have any faith comes in </v>
<v Speaker 4>like they're saying,</v>

2319
01:34:45.731 --> 01:34:46.564
<v Speaker 4>how can all of these things fall?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How can all these things they don't </v>

2320
01:34:50.051 --> 01:34:50.830
<v Speaker 4>know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jamie,</v>

2321
01:34:50.830 --> 01:34:52.460
<v Speaker 4>explain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can I,</v>

2322
01:34:53.850 --> 01:34:54.683
<v Speaker 4>I took physics like in high school a </v>
<v Speaker 4>little bit in college and one Eddie was </v>

2323
01:34:56.711 --> 01:34:57.740
<v Speaker 4>going on rant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was,</v>

2324
01:34:57.920 --> 01:34:58.010
<v Speaker 4>I</v>

2325
01:34:58.010 --> 01:34:59.450
<v Speaker 5>couldn't remember all the things to say </v>
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>

2326
01:34:59.451 --> 01:35:00.284
<v Speaker 5>so it wasn't going to break out physics </v>
<v Speaker 5>laws and whatnot to break down each </v>

2327
01:35:02.661 --> 01:35:03.494
<v Speaker 5>step.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But if you do physics experiments in </v>

2328
01:35:05.031 --> 01:35:05.864
<v Speaker 5>class,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you will easily see all of these steps </v>

2329
01:35:06.891 --> 01:35:08.270
<v Speaker 5>and you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it blows your mind.</v>

2330
01:35:08.271 --> 01:35:09.110
<v Speaker 5>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh my God,</v>

2331
01:35:09.111 --> 01:35:09.530
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

2332
01:35:09.530 --> 01:35:10.363
<v Speaker 5>it's amazing how this works.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's math that's been done over </v>

2333
01:35:12.891 --> 01:35:14.230
<v Speaker 5>hundreds of years that full</v>

2334
01:35:14.260 --> 01:35:15.093
<v Speaker 3>on all these people that have been </v>
<v Speaker 3>studying this stuff for centuries and </v>

2335
01:35:18.840 --> 01:35:22.470
<v Speaker 3>building upon all of the knowledge of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the people before them.</v>

2336
01:35:22.620 --> 01:35:25.020
<v Speaker 3>Like when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when a guy like,</v>

2337
01:35:25.021 --> 01:35:27.060
<v Speaker 3>here's a perfect example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could relate to martial arts.</v>

2338
01:35:27.440 --> 01:35:28.273
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>

2339
01:35:28.550 --> 01:35:29.383
<v Speaker 3>we're seeing today when you see guys </v>
<v Speaker 3>like yourself or guys like Damien Maia </v>

2340
01:35:32.461 --> 01:35:36.690
<v Speaker 3>or guys like wonder boy or any of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>top fighters today are mighty mouse.</v>

2341
01:35:37.020 --> 01:35:37.853
<v Speaker 3>You're seeing the highest expression of </v>
<v Speaker 3>martial arts that has ever existed in </v>

2342
01:35:42.541 --> 01:35:44.220
<v Speaker 3>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is a fact.</v>

2343
01:35:44.310 --> 01:35:45.143
<v Speaker 3>It's an undeniable fact.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anybody that tells me that people from </v>

2344
01:35:47.161 --> 01:35:47.994
<v Speaker 3>the past were better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't know what the fuck you're </v>

2345
01:35:49.321 --> 01:35:50.460
<v Speaker 3>talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>

2346
01:35:50.461 --> 01:35:54.540
<v Speaker 3>there's no chance in hell.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is an undeniable fact,</v>

2347
01:35:54.590 --> 01:35:56.040
<v Speaker 3>that objective fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2348
01:35:56.250 --> 01:36:00.960
<v Speaker 3>well this didn't happen immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It didn't happen because one guy figured</v>

2349
01:36:00.961 --> 01:36:01.794
<v Speaker 3>out how to fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like this is one guy in Brooklyn that </v>

2350
01:36:03.421 --> 01:36:05.190
<v Speaker 3>has his fucking street fight in class.</v>

2351
01:36:05.290 --> 01:36:08.670
<v Speaker 3>It's got this deadly touch of death that</v>
<v Speaker 3>he could do to people and all this other</v>

2352
01:36:08.671 --> 01:36:11.100
<v Speaker 3>things you've been to is all bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They think that chokes work,</v>

2353
01:36:11.160 --> 01:36:12.810
<v Speaker 3>chokes don't work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't work on me.</v>

2354
01:36:12.930 --> 01:36:14.820
<v Speaker 3>When he chokes don't work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you go back to your friend.</v>

2355
01:36:14.821 --> 01:36:16.290
<v Speaker 3>Chokes don't work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The earth is flat.</v>

2356
01:36:16.470 --> 01:36:17.820
<v Speaker 3>It's flat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you sure it's flat?</v>

2357
01:36:18.180 --> 01:36:19.013
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking bananas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To think that someone is going to be </v>

2358
01:36:22.081 --> 01:36:27.081
<v Speaker 3>able to figure if seeking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>manipulate the league minds so easy.</v>

2359
01:36:27.270 --> 01:36:28.103
<v Speaker 3>It's not even the weak minds is the </v>
<v Speaker 3>uninformed mind busy and that watch </v>

2360
01:36:31.081 --> 01:36:32.490
<v Speaker 3>youtube videos,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what it is.</v>

2361
01:36:32.491 --> 01:36:35.520
<v Speaker 3>It's not even that you're weak because a</v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of times when people speak well,</v>

2362
01:36:35.550 --> 01:36:37.670
<v Speaker 3>so what they says Lizard people have you</v>
<v Speaker 3>seen,</v>

2363
01:36:37.671 --> 01:36:38.610
<v Speaker 3>have you seen that as shit?</v>

2364
01:36:40.790 --> 01:36:42.810
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck is that?</v>

2365
01:36:43.050 --> 01:36:44.580
<v Speaker 3>It's all bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All Bullshit.</v>

2366
01:36:45.060 --> 01:36:48.480
<v Speaker 3>These are people that are aliens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they,</v>

2367
01:36:49.470 --> 01:36:51.280
<v Speaker 3>have you seen the youtube videos?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you seen?</v>

2368
01:36:51.720 --> 01:36:52.553
<v Speaker 3>I've seen plenty of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that was one of the David Eick </v>

2369
01:36:53.821 --> 01:36:54.450
<v Speaker 3>things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2370
01:36:54.450 --> 01:36:55.283
<v Speaker 3>He believed that all of the elites were </v>
<v Speaker 3>reptilians grab tea and that's what it </v>

2371
01:36:58.081 --> 01:36:58.914
<v Speaker 3>is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he defend that your reptilian and </v>

2372
01:37:00.121 --> 01:37:01.440
<v Speaker 3>even,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and even a,</v>

2373
01:37:01.450 --> 01:37:02.970
<v Speaker 3>if you defend that you are obtaining </v>
<v Speaker 3>even,</v>

2374
01:37:02.971 --> 01:37:04.270
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2375
01:37:04.330 --> 01:37:05.670
<v Speaker 3>are you putting it up?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

2376
01:37:05.671 --> 01:37:10.050
<v Speaker 3>Do you see that said he is investigating</v>
<v Speaker 3>a possible extra terrestrial signal from</v>

2377
01:37:10.051 --> 01:37:11.670
<v Speaker 3>deep space.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2378
01:37:11.671 --> 01:37:13.710
<v Speaker 3>They said this is nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The contact.</v>

2379
01:37:14.190 --> 01:37:15.023
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Literally.</v>

2380
01:37:15.240 --> 01:37:17.490
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Literally she's in it too.</v>

2381
01:37:17.580 --> 01:37:19.260
<v Speaker 3>Dot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Movie was dope as fuck.</v>

2382
01:37:19.261 --> 01:37:21.900
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that's the image they're trying to,</v>

2383
01:37:21.930 --> 01:37:22.763
<v Speaker 3>but this is a real,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a steady signal that they're </v>

2384
01:37:24.001 --> 01:37:26.070
<v Speaker 3>investigating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is amazing,</v>

2385
01:37:26.071 --> 01:37:28.920
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That movie contact was fucking bad ass,</v>

2386
01:37:28.921 --> 01:37:29.430
<v Speaker 3>by the way.</v>

2387
01:37:29.430 --> 01:37:32.070
<v Speaker 3>I loved that movie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there has to be,</v>

2388
01:37:32.100 --> 01:37:34.380
<v Speaker 3>there has to be something outside of our</v>
<v Speaker 3>realm there.</v>

2389
01:37:34.400 --> 01:37:35.233
<v Speaker 3>He's not just something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's how infinity is best explained </v>

2390
01:37:38.070 --> 01:37:39.990
<v Speaker 3>his.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the best definition that I,</v>

2391
01:37:40.070 --> 01:37:43.590
<v Speaker 3>I've read.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not only is the universe infinite,</v>

2392
01:37:43.860 --> 01:37:44.693
<v Speaker 3>but what that means is if you exist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything that has ever happened on </v>

2393
01:37:50.431 --> 01:37:54.900
<v Speaker 3>this earth in the exact same order,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every pebble falling,</v>

2394
01:37:55.500 --> 01:37:56.333
<v Speaker 3>the same crevice over and over again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean with no variation at all is not </v>

2395
01:38:00.301 --> 01:38:02.550
<v Speaker 3>just happened before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every word I've said,</v>

2396
01:38:02.551 --> 01:38:07.470
<v Speaker 3>including that pause has taken place in </v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly the same way.</v>

2397
01:38:07.620 --> 01:38:08.453
<v Speaker 3>Not just once,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but an infinite number of times where </v>

2398
01:38:11.941 --> 01:38:13.410
<v Speaker 3>there is no end.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why does,</v>

2399
01:38:13.411 --> 01:38:14.244
<v Speaker 3>that's what real infinity is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we can understand infinity because </v>

2400
01:38:16.861 --> 01:38:18.780
<v Speaker 3>we're our brains.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if you tell someone,</v>

2401
01:38:18.840 --> 01:38:20.400
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we drank six budweisers,</v>

2402
01:38:20.401 --> 01:38:21.690
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you guys must have got fucked up.</v>

2403
01:38:21.900 --> 01:38:23.700
<v Speaker 3>That makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get those numbers right.</v>

2404
01:38:24.210 --> 01:38:27.900
<v Speaker 3>Do you really understand like when </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone says 6,000</v>

2405
01:38:27.901 --> 01:38:28.471
<v Speaker 3>miles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you go,</v>

2406
01:38:28.471 --> 01:38:29.700
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

2407
01:38:29.701 --> 01:38:32.610
<v Speaker 3>well the United States is how many </v>
<v Speaker 3>thousand miles you've got to go,</v>

2408
01:38:32.611 --> 01:38:34.920
<v Speaker 3>how many thousand miles past that it </v>
<v Speaker 3>gets a little blurry,</v>

2409
01:38:34.921 --> 01:38:35.370
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2410
01:38:35.370 --> 01:38:37.500
<v Speaker 3>And then you go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of the moon is 250,000</v>

2411
01:38:37.501 --> 01:38:38.221
<v Speaker 3>miles away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go,</v>

2412
01:38:38.221 --> 01:38:40.290
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How far is that?</v>

2413
01:38:40.410 --> 01:38:41.161
<v Speaker 3>And you start thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2414
01:38:41.161 --> 01:38:42.230
<v Speaker 3>the moon is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2415
01:38:42.330 --> 01:38:44.190
<v Speaker 3>how far is the sun?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's a million.</v>

2416
01:38:44.280 --> 01:38:44.761
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

2417
01:38:44.761 --> 01:38:48.780
<v Speaker 3>they found this fucking planet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's earthlike and it's four light years</v>

2418
01:38:48.781 --> 01:38:50.250
<v Speaker 3>away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's that?</v>

2419
01:38:50.760 --> 01:38:53.130
<v Speaker 3>What's four light years?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How fast is light go?</v>

2420
01:38:53.820 --> 01:38:54.770
<v Speaker 3>I'm lost,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2421
01:38:54.780 --> 01:38:57.150
<v Speaker 3>30 to a hundred feet a second.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2422
01:38:57.151 --> 01:38:57.984
<v Speaker 3>So we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have his senses and what we have is </v>

2423
01:39:01.201 --> 01:39:02.034
<v Speaker 3>an understanding of our environment </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's immediate to us because we're </v>

2424
01:39:04.951 --> 01:39:05.784
<v Speaker 3>basically monkeys that just a few </v>
<v Speaker 3>thousand years ago were worried about </v>

2425
01:39:08.461 --> 01:39:09.420
<v Speaker 3>being eaten by shit.</v>

2426
01:39:09.420 --> 01:39:12.360
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So finally we reached the stage where we</v>

2427
01:39:12.361 --> 01:39:15.060
<v Speaker 3>don't have to worry too much about being</v>
<v Speaker 3>eaten by Shit,</v>

2428
01:39:15.090 --> 01:39:17.130
<v Speaker 3>which is why shark videos are so awesome</v>
<v Speaker 3>to us.</v>

2429
01:39:17.380 --> 01:39:18.450
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2430
01:39:18.451 --> 01:39:20.300
<v Speaker 3>so now you're on evolution.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a,</v>

2431
01:39:20.450 --> 01:39:22.590
<v Speaker 3>this is what I'm just saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a recent state.</v>

2432
01:39:22.800 --> 01:39:23.633
<v Speaker 3>What we're trying to understand things </v>
<v Speaker 3>past our immediate area of things that </v>

2433
01:39:26.461 --> 01:39:27.294
<v Speaker 3>are going to eat us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we don't really have the capacity or </v>

2434
01:39:29.731 --> 01:39:32.760
<v Speaker 3>the need,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or we'd never had the need before to try</v>

2435
01:39:32.761 --> 01:39:35.910
<v Speaker 3>to understand what the fuck 250 million </v>
<v Speaker 3>miles is,</v>

2436
01:39:36.060 --> 01:39:39.090
<v Speaker 3>or 250,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>miles or four light years.</v>

2437
01:39:39.091 --> 01:39:41.250
<v Speaker 3>It's too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's too confusing to us.</v>

2438
01:39:41.460 --> 01:39:42.293
<v Speaker 3>It's hard for us to grasp.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when someone starts talking about </v>

2439
01:39:44.581 --> 01:39:45.414
<v Speaker 3>infinity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's impossible to grasp because what </v>

2440
01:39:47.981 --> 01:39:51.210
<v Speaker 3>his affinity means is there's no end it </v>
<v Speaker 3>never,</v>

2441
01:39:51.211 --> 01:39:51.781
<v Speaker 3>ever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ever,</v>

2442
01:39:51.781 --> 01:39:52.291
<v Speaker 3>ever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ever,</v>

2443
01:39:52.291 --> 01:39:53.124
<v Speaker 3>ever ends.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So everything on this earth that's ever </v>

2444
01:39:56.461 --> 01:39:58.560
<v Speaker 3>happened,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like in the universe,</v>

2445
01:39:58.590 --> 01:40:03.060
<v Speaker 3>not only is there a cowboy that never </v>
<v Speaker 3>found that rec center and never got into</v>

2446
01:40:03.061 --> 01:40:03.894
<v Speaker 3>fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's infinite varieties of all </v>

2447
01:40:06.841 --> 01:40:07.674
<v Speaker 3>the different lives of cowboy with every</v>
<v Speaker 3>single different step you took and </v>

2448
01:40:12.090 --> 01:40:12.923
<v Speaker 3>infinite numbers of each one of those </v>
<v Speaker 3>individual choices with every single </v>

2449
01:40:16.711 --> 01:40:18.180
<v Speaker 3>word,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every single phrase,</v>

2450
01:40:18.181 --> 01:40:21.960
<v Speaker 3>every single thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all in the exact same order taking place</v>

2451
01:40:21.980 --> 01:40:23.520
<v Speaker 3>an infinite number of times.</v>

2452
01:40:23.550 --> 01:40:24.383
<v Speaker 3>I need dmt to understand this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have kid that's not even going to </v>

2453
01:40:26.251 --> 01:40:27.450
<v Speaker 3>work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't understand it.</v>

2454
01:40:27.451 --> 01:40:30.870
<v Speaker 3>I'm saying I don't understand it because</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's impossible to understand.</v>

2455
01:40:31.020 --> 01:40:33.650
<v Speaker 3>The universe has no end.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If the universe has,</v>

2456
01:40:33.780 --> 01:40:34.613
<v Speaker 3>this is the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the main mindblower of the universe </v>

2457
01:40:38.280 --> 01:40:39.960
<v Speaker 3>inside every galaxy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You look up there,</v>

2458
01:40:39.961 --> 01:40:40.794
<v Speaker 3>there's hundreds of millions gallon </v>
<v Speaker 3>inside every galaxy is a supermassive </v>

2459
01:40:44.370 --> 01:40:47.340
<v Speaker 3>black hole.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's one half of 1% of the mass.</v>

2460
01:40:47.360 --> 01:40:48.193
<v Speaker 3>The galaxy scientists believe it is </v>
<v Speaker 3>entirely possible that you go through </v>

2461
01:40:52.111 --> 01:40:54.220
<v Speaker 3>that black hole and you hit</v>

2462
01:40:54.370 --> 01:40:55.203
<v Speaker 4>an infinite number of other universes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's each one of those is a new </v>

2463
01:40:59.321 --> 01:41:01.690
<v Speaker 4>universe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like every black hall you go into,</v>

2464
01:41:01.700 --> 01:41:03.670
<v Speaker 4>it is a new universe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that universe,</v>

2465
01:41:03.760 --> 01:41:05.620
<v Speaker 4>there's hundreds of billions of </v>
<v Speaker 4>galaxies.</v>

2466
01:41:05.680 --> 01:41:07.780
<v Speaker 4>Each one has a black hole in the center </v>
<v Speaker 4>of it.</v>

2467
01:41:07.810 --> 01:41:08.643
<v Speaker 4>Each one of those takes you to another </v>
<v Speaker 4>universe of hundreds of millions and </v>

2468
01:41:12.490 --> 01:41:14.680
<v Speaker 4>billions of galaxies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and each one of them as a black hole.</v>

2469
01:41:14.740 --> 01:41:17.470
<v Speaker 4>And it goes on and on and on and on and </v>
<v Speaker 4>on,</v>

2470
01:41:17.560 --> 01:41:21.100
<v Speaker 4>and there's no end.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So this infinite universe that we see is</v>

2471
01:41:21.101 --> 01:41:26.101
<v Speaker 4>one of infinite universes that we can't </v>
<v Speaker 4>even possibly understand.</v>

2472
01:41:27.880 --> 01:41:30.670
<v Speaker 4>There's no way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no end to any of it,</v>

2473
01:41:31.470 --> 01:41:36.040
<v Speaker 4>not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So from this podcast,</v>

<v Speaker 4>the a good percentage of the people that</v>

2593
01:47:15.391 --> 01:47:19.080
<v Speaker 4>are listening to this right now are </v>
<v Speaker 4>stuck living some life where you have to</v>

2594
01:47:19.081 --> 01:47:22.590
<v Speaker 4>pretend all day long that you don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>think certain things.</v>

2595
01:47:22.650 --> 01:47:24.140
<v Speaker 4>I liked the way he's dressed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's,</v>

2596
01:47:24.150 --> 01:47:26.130

<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

2598
01:47:28.200 --> 01:47:29.070
<v Speaker 4>Good for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2599
01:47:29.071 --> 01:47:30.480
<v Speaker 4>my Dick is big enough to hold his hands </v>
<v Speaker 4>up.</v>

2600
01:47:30.481 --> 01:47:33.000
<v Speaker 4>God bless you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Saggy pants.</v>

2601
01:47:33.030 --> 01:47:36.150
<v Speaker 4>It's one of the things that frustrates </v>
<v Speaker 4>me the most about this youth culture.</v>

2602
01:47:36.390 --> 01:47:38.730
<v Speaker 4>I would have thought that with the UFC </v>
<v Speaker 4>skinny,</v>

2603
01:47:40.080 --> 01:47:42.420
<v Speaker 4>skinny and sagging is a bad combo.</v>

2604
01:47:42.480 --> 01:47:44.970
<v Speaker 4>That's a bad combo.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's confused.</v>

2605
01:47:45.210 --> 01:47:46.710
<v Speaker 4>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If that's confused,</v>

2606
01:47:46.740 --> 01:47:47.573
<v Speaker 4>but it's the new trend.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean everyone wants to be in the </v>

2607
01:47:48.691 --> 01:47:49.710
<v Speaker 4>train.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So whatever it is,</v>

2608
01:47:49.711 --> 01:47:51.450
<v Speaker 4>it is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck is.</v>

2609
01:47:51.451 --> 01:47:53.310
<v Speaker 4>Why is sagging jeans,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why is it,</v>

2610
01:47:53.311 --> 01:47:55.920
<v Speaker 4>what is that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's all comes from prison,</v>

2611
01:47:55.921 --> 01:47:56.754
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cause they didn't give her a men of </v>

2612
01:47:58.451 --> 01:48:00.210
<v Speaker 4>prison,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I have no fucking idea.</v>

2613
01:48:00.211 --> 01:48:01.044
<v Speaker 4>I think the idea was that you couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>get a belt because you would choke </v>

2614
01:48:04.081 --> 01:48:04.914
<v Speaker 4>yourself to death.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can hang yourself with a belt so </v>

2615
01:48:06.151 --> 01:48:08.100
<v Speaker 4>that your everyone's pants work sort of </v>
<v Speaker 4>sagging.</v>

2616
01:48:08.220 --> 01:48:11.940
<v Speaker 4>So it made you look like you were some </v>
<v Speaker 4>sort of a criminal type character if you</v>

2617
01:48:11.941 --> 01:48:15.780
<v Speaker 4>wanted around with no belt on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like as if you're pretending that you're</v>

2618
01:48:15.781 --> 01:48:19.440
<v Speaker 4>out there in prison.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What your Jordan's on and pretending.</v>

2619
01:48:19.650 --> 01:48:22.150
<v Speaker 4>I don't know your underwear hanging out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a,</v>

2620
01:48:22.190 --> 01:48:23.023
<v Speaker 4>I'm a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a big fan of my jeans where they </v>

2621
01:48:24.331 --> 01:48:24.780
<v Speaker 4>fit.</v>

2622
01:48:24.780 --> 01:48:25.613
<v Speaker 4>But other gay guys that were in prison </v>
<v Speaker 4>or God's used to fuck guys in prison </v>

2623
01:48:28.380 --> 01:48:29.213
<v Speaker 4>that had been interviewed said that that</v>
<v Speaker 4>was how guys would let you know they </v>

2624
01:48:31.021 --> 01:48:34.020
<v Speaker 4>were ready to be taken.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They'd have their pants halfway down and</v>

2625
01:48:34.021 --> 01:48:36.240
<v Speaker 4>that was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was the international sign for take</v>

2626
01:48:36.241 --> 01:48:37.074
<v Speaker 4>the booty.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did you ever see that dude on like one </v>

2627
01:48:38.491 --> 01:48:40.800
<v Speaker 4>of those prison shows that called </v>
<v Speaker 4>himself the booty bandit?</v>

2628
01:48:41.570 --> 01:48:43.020
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ever seen that guy?</v>

2629

<v Speaker 4>Here he goes,</v>

<v Speaker 4>importance.</v>

2666
01:50:32.330 --> 01:50:34.550
<v Speaker 4>That booty.</v>

<v Speaker 4>They put a laugh track on it.</v>

2669
01:50:40.580 --> 01:50:45.010
<v Speaker 4>Here's the raw version of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't have sound.</v>

2670
01:50:47.170 --> 01:50:48.980
<v Speaker 4>It was just talking about fucking guys </v>
<v Speaker 4>in prison.</v>

2671
01:50:50.020 --> 01:50:54.530
<v Speaker 4>It for currency.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh Wow.</v>

2672
01:50:54.920 --> 01:50:56.180
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the cm punk thing.</v>

2673
01:50:56.240 --> 01:50:57.960
<v Speaker 4>I didn't say anything bad about him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We,</v>

2674
01:50:58.000 --> 01:50:59.220
<v Speaker 4>he can't say anything about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

2675
01:50:59.221 --> 01:51:00.330
<v Speaker 4>do you want me to hype it up?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And like,</v>

2676
01:51:00.490 --> 01:51:02.600
<v Speaker 4>it's very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He did the right thing.</v>

2677
01:51:02.690 --> 01:51:05.000
<v Speaker 4>He went to a real good camp.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He uh,</v>

2678
01:51:05.020 --> 01:51:07.400
<v Speaker 4>he didn't fight for two whole years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He'd just been training.</v>

2679
01:51:07.850 --> 01:51:11.470
<v Speaker 4>You would have to apparently smokers </v>
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>

2680
01:51:12.160 --> 01:51:17.160
<v Speaker 4>There's no way you could learn a decade </v>
<v Speaker 4>of skills in three months.</v>

2681
01:51:18.800 --> 01:51:20.360
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that kid he's fighting is good.</v>

2682
01:51:20.530 --> 01:51:21.800
<v Speaker 4>The kids fight,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fighting can scrap.</v>

2683
01:51:21.860 --> 01:51:23.180
<v Speaker 4>I liked the way it took that dude's </v>
<v Speaker 4>back.</v>

2684
01:51:23.181 --> 01:51:25.250
<v Speaker 4>I liked the way he choked him out and </v>
<v Speaker 4>showed real good technique.</v>

2685
01:51:25.580 --> 01:51:28.040
<v Speaker 4>He knows how to fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like it's not going to be an easy fight.</v>

2686
01:51:28.160 --> 01:51:31.550
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean in every Samsung it's to fight in</v>

2687
01:51:31.551 --> 01:51:32.690
<v Speaker 4>the UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm Phil.</v>

2688
01:51:32.750 --> 01:51:34.010

<v Speaker 4>All right.</v>

2689
01:51:34.790 --> 01:51:36.500
<v Speaker 4>Fair enough to his name.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2690
01:51:36.770 --> 01:51:37.820
<v Speaker 4>He's going to be filled.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Brooks.</v>

2691
01:51:37.821 --> 01:51:38.654
<v Speaker 4>When he fights,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think I'm pretty sure they're coming </v>

2692
01:51:39.681 --> 01:51:42.050
<v Speaker 4>out of the punk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are they really saying cm punk?</v>

2693
01:51:42.051 --> 01:51:43.490
<v Speaker 4>Why not?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because I don't know.</v>

2694
01:51:43.491 --> 01:51:47.060
<v Speaker 4>Well they must've made a deal with the </v>
<v Speaker 4>wwe so they could use brock lesnar.</v>

2697
01:51:51.081 --> 01:51:54.740

<v Speaker 4>Is that necessary?</v>

2698
01:51:55.250 --> 01:51:56.083
<v Speaker 4>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think when I'm 80 I should be able to </v>

2699
01:51:56.781 --> 01:51:57.614
<v Speaker 4>get that back.</v>

2700
01:52:02.510 --> 01:52:04.620
<v Speaker 4>Is there another sport that owns your </v>
<v Speaker 4>likeness?</v>

2701
01:52:05.010 --> 01:52:08.150
<v Speaker 4>Tell on your legs or life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cm punk.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Zero.</v>

2703

<v Speaker 4>but the kids good.</v>

2704
01:52:12.540 --> 01:52:15.200
<v Speaker 4>How was he in the UFC?</v>
<v Speaker 4>At and out because just for this fight,</v>

2705
01:52:15.680 --> 01:52:18.350
<v Speaker 4>that's how he's in there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well that's the wire they get.</v>

2706
01:52:18.351 --> 01:52:19.400
<v Speaker 4>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're right.</v>

2707
01:52:19.401 --> 01:52:22.220
<v Speaker 4>It's not fair.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it is because it doesn't matter.</v>

2708
01:52:22.370 --> 01:52:24.260
<v Speaker 4>It's not like he's taking a fight away </v>
<v Speaker 4>from somebody.</v>

2709
01:52:24.410 --> 01:52:25.640
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We got to see somebody.</v>

<v Speaker 4>if,</v>

2711
01:52:26.110 --> 01:52:30.450

<v Speaker 4>one 70.</v>

2712
01:52:31.060 --> 01:52:34.610

<v Speaker 4>notions they have of this life and they </v>

2745

2766
01:54:39.590 --> 01:54:40.423
<v Speaker 4>But I'm not that dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think anybody should tell me </v>

2767
01:54:42.261 --> 01:54:43.094
<v Speaker 4>that I can't eat meat and I don't think </v>
<v Speaker 4>I should be able to tell anybody that </v>

2768
01:54:45.121 --> 01:54:47.720
<v Speaker 4>they have to eat meat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think if you're as dude that has it in</v>

2769
01:54:47.721 --> 01:54:50.160
<v Speaker 4>your head that you don't want an animal </v>
<v Speaker 4>to die cause you,</v>

2770
01:54:50.161 --> 01:54:50.994
<v Speaker 4>you sync up with all these animals and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you feel like if I can get through this </v>

2771
01:54:53.241 --> 01:54:55.370
<v Speaker 4>life without an animal dying on my </v>
<v Speaker 4>behalf,</v>

2772
01:54:55.850 --> 01:54:58.580
<v Speaker 4>that's better in this day and age.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>

2773
01:54:58.790 --> 01:55:02.660
<v Speaker 4>But let's take away everything and say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you are just out there on your own.</v>

2774
01:55:03.380 --> 01:55:06.330
<v Speaker 4>You're going to have to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're going to have to fucking happy.</v>

2775
01:55:06.370 --> 01:55:08.120
<v Speaker 4>You can only pick so many fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>berries.</v>

2776
01:55:08.200 --> 01:55:09.033
<v Speaker 4>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's only so many berries that grow </v>

2777
01:55:09.861 --> 01:55:11.300
<v Speaker 4>seasonally.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not enough.</v>

2778
01:55:11.660 --> 01:55:14.330
<v Speaker 4>It's not enough calories.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2779
01:55:15.140 --> 01:55:16.820
<v Speaker 4>we are made.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2780
01:55:17.930 --> 01:55:20.810
<v Speaker 4>the vegans talk about gorillas.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They only eat bananas.</v>

2781
01:55:21.140 --> 01:55:24.020
<v Speaker 4>They actually like leaves and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2782
01:55:24.021 --> 01:55:25.220
<v Speaker 4>you don't get bananas at the zoo.</v>

2783
01:55:28.190 --> 01:55:30.200
<v Speaker 4>Here's a girl who would have banana in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the wild.</v>

2784
01:55:30.470 --> 01:55:32.390
<v Speaker 4>Now they're eating like bamboo stalks </v>
<v Speaker 4>and shit.</v>

2785
01:55:32.410 --> 01:55:33.830
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>regardless,</v>

2786
01:55:33.890 --> 01:55:37.520
<v Speaker 4>we're not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're not saying we're not.</v>

2787
01:55:37.760 --> 01:55:38.593
<v Speaker 4>We're omnivores.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We are made to kill gorillas and eat </v>

2788
01:55:40.371 --> 01:55:41.300
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2789
01:55:41.301 --> 01:55:43.350
<v Speaker 4>I don't think people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they definitely grill us.</v>

2790
01:55:43.351 --> 01:55:44.184
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean if,</v>

2791
01:55:44.200 --> 01:55:45.033
<v Speaker 4>if it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if it was eat a bamboo shoot or a </v>

2792
01:55:46.621 --> 01:55:48.210
<v Speaker 4>fucking gorilla,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm taking the gorilla down.</v>

2793
01:55:48.270 --> 01:55:51.390
<v Speaker 4>But I think the grills anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I know they eat a lot of monkeys.</v>

2794
01:55:51.391 --> 01:55:55.260
<v Speaker 4>Like they call it bushmeat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bushmeat is like a real issue in some,</v>

2795
01:55:55.261 --> 01:55:56.094
<v Speaker 4>a endangered species because a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'll shoot like chimps and shit like </v>

2796
01:55:59.251 --> 01:56:00.870
<v Speaker 4>that and they'll eat them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I'm not a Vegan obviously,</v>

2836
01:57:57.661 --> 01:58:01.020
<v Speaker 4>but taking the point of Vegans,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I could see what would they're trying to</v>

2837
01:58:01.021 --> 01:58:04.680
<v Speaker 4>do is they're trying to not contribute </v>
<v Speaker 4>to any animals dying,</v>

2838
01:58:05.160 --> 01:58:08.940
<v Speaker 4>but they're put here to die.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that a bad thing to say?</v>

2839
01:58:08.941 --> 01:58:12.660
<v Speaker 4>Is that more I wa I don't mean it like </v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

2840
01:58:12.661 --> 01:58:16.710
<v Speaker 4>but I mean we have to eat and we are the</v>
<v Speaker 4>top of the food chain.</v>

2841
01:58:16.770 --> 01:58:18.090
<v Speaker 4>We definitely at the top of the food </v>
<v Speaker 4>chain,</v>

2842
01:58:18.091 --> 01:58:19.920
<v Speaker 4>and there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is where I used to describe it,</v>

2843
01:58:19.950 --> 01:58:20.783
<v Speaker 4>there's a war going on between all the </v>
<v Speaker 4>animals on this planet and the wars for </v>

2844
01:58:23.581 --> 01:58:28.230
<v Speaker 4>survival and we are so far ahead of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>rest of the people competing the war.</v>

2845
01:58:28.350 --> 01:58:29.183
<v Speaker 4>We forgot it to war and we forgot that </v>
<v Speaker 4>we have these prison colonies in our </v>

2846
01:58:32.041 --> 01:58:33.510
<v Speaker 4>cities.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We call them zoos.</v>

2847
01:58:34.230 --> 01:58:36.810
<v Speaker 4>That's a fucking prison.</v>
<v Speaker 4>College shows you,</v>

2848
01:58:36.811 --> 01:58:37.644
<v Speaker 4>Oh the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we have won the battle of these stupid </v>

2849
01:58:39.631 --> 01:58:42.140
<v Speaker 4>fucking country alligators.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then job</v>

2850
01:58:42.240 --> 01:58:43.073
<v Speaker 1>people like me that go swimming and </v>
<v Speaker 1>chase sharks and they get eaten and </v>

2851
01:58:45.431 --> 01:58:46.360
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ha,</v>

2852
01:58:46.480 --> 01:58:50.320
<v Speaker 1>one for the low column.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Has anybody ever gone like getting eaten</v>

2853
01:58:50.321 --> 01:58:52.470
<v Speaker 1>when they were diving?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not common.</v>

2854
01:58:52.510 --> 01:58:54.690
<v Speaker 1>It's not very common at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really uncommon right there.</v>

2855
01:58:54.730 --> 01:58:57.070
<v Speaker 1>I think it's maybe one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2856
01:58:57.100 --> 01:58:57.940
<v Speaker 1>Maybe ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2891
02:00:14.141 --> 02:00:16.960
<v Speaker 1>Like any dog over 70 pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a German shepherd or something like</v>

2892
02:00:16.961 --> 02:00:19.000

02:03:17.691 --> 02:03:18.770
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand.</v>

2972
02:03:18.771 --> 02:03:21.860
<v Speaker 1>But to me like an animal that I'm taking</v>
<v Speaker 1>care of becomes family.</v>

2973
02:03:21.890 --> 02:03:25.850
<v Speaker 1>His family have to take care of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if it was like my kid,</v>

2974
02:03:26.120 --> 02:03:29.270
<v Speaker 1>I would spend 1500 bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if it's like my dog,</v>

2975
02:03:29.300 --> 02:03:31.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm still gonna spend that 1500 bucks </v>
<v Speaker 1>dog.</v>

2976
02:03:31.540 --> 02:03:34.550
<v Speaker 1>Just a dog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But a dog can make it a dog.</v>

2977
02:03:34.551 --> 02:03:35.570
<v Speaker 1>They make it a little kid.</v>

2978
02:03:35.570 --> 02:03:37.630
<v Speaker 1>It's not going to make it very </v>
<v Speaker 1>rattlesnake.</v>

2979
02:03:37.760 --> 02:03:38.593
<v Speaker 1>We're so sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could you fucking imagine that we're so </v>

2980
02:03:40.491 --> 02:03:42.170
<v Speaker 1>weak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Taking a fucking,</v>

2981
02:03:42.890 --> 02:03:46.190
<v Speaker 1>so I almost got bit by a rattlesnake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was out of the lake walking around.</v>

2982
02:03:47.060 --> 02:03:50.240
<v Speaker 1>One struck at my ankle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>barely missed me.</v>

2983
02:03:50.510 --> 02:03:51.343
<v Speaker 1>So went and grabbed my gun out of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>truck and I said that I shot this </v>

2984
02:03:55.530 --> 02:03:56.363
<v Speaker 1>motherfucker being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and instead of kering up and running </v>

2985
02:03:58.971 --> 02:03:59.804
<v Speaker 1>off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that fucking snake would just lunge at </v>

2986
02:04:01.071 --> 02:04:03.860
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I shoot it to get the shot it body.</v>

2987
02:04:04.070 --> 02:04:04.903
<v Speaker 1>I just shot everywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everywhere but his head because I'm a </v>

2988
02:04:06.171 --> 02:04:10.460
<v Speaker 1>terrible fucking shot so well then shoot</v>
<v Speaker 1>him in the head.</v>

2989
02:04:10.461 --> 02:04:11.294
<v Speaker 1>You got to give away love.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm ripping this dude's body apart </v>

2990
02:04:14.120 --> 02:04:14.953
<v Speaker 1>and he's like Ha.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somehow still something that the muscle </v>

2991
02:04:18.650 --> 02:04:21.290
<v Speaker 1>to like stay upright and fucking lash at</v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

2992
02:04:21.470 --> 02:04:24.320
<v Speaker 1>They're like devil dogs man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For sure.</v>

2993
02:04:24.380 --> 02:04:26.640
<v Speaker 1>We think what they are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

2994
02:04:26.690 --> 02:04:28.760
<v Speaker 1>when people talk about Reptilians the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

2995
02:04:28.761 --> 02:04:30.110
<v Speaker 1>what are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are they really worried about?</v>

2996
02:04:30.111 --> 02:04:32.150
<v Speaker 1>They're not worried about people turning</v>
<v Speaker 1>into panda bears.</v>

2997
02:04:32.430 --> 02:04:34.030
<v Speaker 1>They're worried about people being </v>
<v Speaker 1>reptiles.</v>

2998
02:04:34.031 --> 02:04:38.040
<v Speaker 1>So people being completely cold and </v>
<v Speaker 1>focused on the at hand with no</v>

2999
02:04:38.040 --> 02:04:40.020
<v Speaker 3>emotions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what a reptile is,</v>

3000
02:04:40.021 --> 02:04:41.420
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what people are worried.</v>

3001
02:04:41.421 --> 02:04:42.960
<v Speaker 3>That was sticker back here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3002
02:04:43.080 --> 02:04:43.913
<v Speaker 3>it's going good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going down so hopefully you have </v>

3003
02:04:45.271 --> 02:04:46.410
<v Speaker 3>something to worry about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

3004
02:04:46.440 --> 02:04:47.273
<v Speaker 3>We'll talk about rattlesnakes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gophers and it is kind of weird that </v>

3005
02:04:51.031 --> 02:04:54.750
<v Speaker 3>some animals have poison.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like some,</v>

3006
02:04:54.810 --> 02:04:55.643
<v Speaker 3>some creatures that live on this planet </v>
<v Speaker 3>have poison and they could fuck you up </v>

3007
02:04:59.281 --> 02:05:00.114
<v Speaker 3>and they live amongst us like this </v>
<v Speaker 3>rattlesnakes all around where we are </v>

3008
02:05:02.250 --> 02:05:03.083
<v Speaker 3>right here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know in the valley you can go out </v>

3009
02:05:04.891 --> 02:05:05.724
<v Speaker 3>and those hillsides anywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like go down to one 18 and go on those </v>

3010
02:05:09.241 --> 02:05:12.720
<v Speaker 3>hiking trails.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People find rattlesnakes there all day.</v>

3011
02:05:13.200 --> 02:05:16.890
<v Speaker 3>If you have a house and you live </v>
<v Speaker 3>anywhere in the Los Angeles area,</v>

3012
02:05:16.920 --> 02:05:21.180
<v Speaker 3>it's entirely possible that if you leave</v>
<v Speaker 3>an area undisturbed long in a huff,</v>

3013
02:05:21.420 --> 02:05:22.990
<v Speaker 3>a black widow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a little nest,</v>

3014
02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:25.710
<v Speaker 3>they're entirely possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've seen,</v>

3015
02:05:25.950 --> 02:05:27.930
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how many black widows in my</v>
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>

3016
02:05:28.650 --> 02:05:31.460
<v Speaker 3>A hundred at least.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe hundreds.</v>

3017
02:05:32.690 --> 02:05:35.310
<v Speaker 5>That's all too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Last week here in this place.</v>

3018
02:05:35.470 --> 02:05:36.303
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That fucking studios haunted or we got </v>

3019
02:05:39.991 --> 02:05:40.980
<v Speaker 5>him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You got him?</v>

3020
02:05:41.160 --> 02:05:42.300
<v Speaker 5>I wanted to on that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3021
02:05:42.301 --> 02:05:44.890
<v Speaker 5>the Seti alien signal thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3022
02:05:45.020 --> 02:05:45.853
<v Speaker 5>Did you look into that at all?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did you read their article that came </v>

3023
02:05:46.951 --> 02:05:48.510
<v Speaker 5>out?</v>
<v Speaker 5>The the really,</v>

3024
02:05:48.850 --> 02:05:51.580
<v Speaker 3>they're really fun title is all I want </v>
<v Speaker 3>to get into.</v>

3025
02:05:52.050 --> 02:05:53.140
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is why,</v>

3026
02:05:53.350 --> 02:05:55.110
<v Speaker 3>because I want to hope that this act,</v>

3027
02:05:55.660 --> 02:05:57.600
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to like display alien </v>
<v Speaker 5>signal.</v>

3028
02:05:57.810 --> 02:05:58.643
<v Speaker 5>So when you go into it and they explain </v>
<v Speaker 5>the likelihood of it being an alien </v>

3029
02:06:01.711 --> 02:06:03.010
<v Speaker 5>signal,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's super depressing.</v>

3030
02:06:03.150 --> 02:06:04.350
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know.</v>

3031
02:06:05.400 --> 02:06:07.040
<v Speaker 5>This was the thing I wanted to ask you </v>
<v Speaker 5>about the,</v>

3032
02:06:07.140 --> 02:06:09.750
<v Speaker 5>this a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's called a dyson shell.</v>

3033
02:06:09.870 --> 02:06:10.980
<v Speaker 5>What is this?</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3034
02:06:11.040 --> 02:06:11.860
<v Speaker 5>they said the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3035
02:06:11.860 --> 02:06:12.693
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one of the hypothesis of if this was </v>

3036
02:06:14.251 --> 02:06:17.610
<v Speaker 5>possibly a civilization that it's one of</v>
<v Speaker 5>two types of silver.</v>

3037
02:06:17.611 --> 02:06:18.590
<v Speaker 5>I don't remember the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like a,</v>

3038
02:06:18.630 --> 02:06:22.920
<v Speaker 5>it's a Russian named a car dash of type </v>
<v Speaker 5>two civilization.</v>

3039
02:06:23.190 --> 02:06:26.100
<v Speaker 5>So this is a nice atmosphere.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is a massive structure.</v>

3040
02:06:26.101 --> 02:06:30.060
<v Speaker 5>It's three meters thick.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That would encompass the Earth's orbit,</v>

3041
02:06:30.061 --> 02:06:30.894
<v Speaker 5>including the sun and Venus,</v>
<v Speaker 5>harnessing the energy to then shoot out </v>

3042
02:06:34.171 --> 02:06:37.650
<v Speaker 5>an Omni directional signal,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is what got,</v>

3043
02:06:37.710 --> 02:06:39.420
<v Speaker 5>which is what they picked up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wait a minute.</v>

3044
02:06:39.450 --> 02:06:42.300
<v Speaker 5>What?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's three meters thick and it covers</v>

3045
02:06:42.690 --> 02:06:44.850
<v Speaker 5>the whole solar system.</v>

3046
02:06:44.910 --> 02:06:45.743
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll have the first three levels of it </v>

3047
02:06:47.491 --> 02:06:49.980
<v Speaker 5>up into earth.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It would have to be that.</v>

3048
02:06:50.010 --> 02:06:54.000
<v Speaker 5>That's what this hypothesis says.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't understand the radius of this.</v>

3049
02:06:54.001 --> 02:06:55.030
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3050
02:06:55.230 --> 02:06:57.700
<v Speaker 5>in order to make that sort of energy to </v>
<v Speaker 5>Hump Day yet,</v>

3051
02:06:58.060 --> 02:07:01.410
<v Speaker 5>if it's not this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a type one civilization,</v>

3052
02:07:01.411 --> 02:07:03.900
<v Speaker 5>which is sort of like what we are.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We can harness our stars,</v>

3053
02:07:04.200 --> 02:07:05.033
<v Speaker 5>the sound like we can do solar panels </v>
<v Speaker 5>and then shoot out a directional signal </v>

3054
02:07:08.430 --> 02:07:10.260
<v Speaker 5>pointed at Earth,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is how we picked it up.</v>

3055
02:07:10.400 --> 02:07:11.233
<v Speaker 5>He,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but isn't it also possible that some </v>

3056
02:07:12.211 --> 02:07:15.240
<v Speaker 5>sort of a galactic event?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that's probably more likely that</v>

3057
02:07:15.241 --> 02:07:17.010
<v Speaker 5>it's just a blip and they don't know </v>
<v Speaker 5>what the blip is yet.</v>

3058
02:07:17.160 --> 02:07:17.993
<v Speaker 5>I think it's too big.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Donald serone so we went to hold things </v>

3059
02:07:20.671 --> 02:07:23.520
<v Speaker 5>two bags back to space.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jamie jumped,</v>

3060
02:07:23.521 --> 02:07:26.730
<v Speaker 5>jumped right back in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's been waiting love space.</v>

3061
02:07:26.760 --> 02:07:28.830
<v Speaker 5>He loves the space to change too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wish I could.</v>

3062
02:07:30.830 --> 02:07:33.200
<v Speaker 3>Nobody can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean even Neil degrasse Tyson,</v>

3063
02:07:33.380 --> 02:07:34.250
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Neil degrasse Tyson,</v>

3064
02:07:34.251 --> 02:07:36.370
<v Speaker 3>I real fucking good about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>presidential</v>

3065
02:07:36.370 --> 02:07:39.220
<v Speaker 4>candidates.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He said there should be an option that's</v>

3066
02:07:39.221 --> 02:07:42.430
<v Speaker 4>called none of the above and that when </v>
<v Speaker 4>none of the above wins,</v>

3067
02:07:42.490 --> 02:07:44.350
<v Speaker 4>we have to start all over again with new</v>
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

3068
02:07:45.010 --> 02:07:49.870
<v Speaker 4>That is a very fucking smart option.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So while we're touching on religion,</v>

3069
02:07:49.910 --> 02:07:52.570
<v Speaker 4>I try one of those again where I don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>swallow it or you're going in again.</v>

3070
02:07:53.140 --> 02:07:56.320
<v Speaker 4>What is your outlook on the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on the presidential election here?</v>

3071
02:07:57.250 --> 02:07:58.083
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's good because it shows how fucking </v>

3072
02:07:59.681 --> 02:08:00.514
<v Speaker 4>stupid this whole job is of having this </v>
<v Speaker 4>one person who is a part of a two party </v>

3073
02:08:04.931 --> 02:08:05.764
<v Speaker 4>system,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we have to like be a registered </v>

3074
02:08:07.151 --> 02:08:07.984
<v Speaker 4>Republican or Democrat to vote in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>primaries that decide who these people </v>

3075
02:08:10.991 --> 02:08:13.240
<v Speaker 4>are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They get to represent this party or that</v>

3076
02:08:13.241 --> 02:08:16.390
<v Speaker 4>party and they get to this position and </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's only two of them.</v>

3077
02:08:16.420 --> 02:08:17.253
<v Speaker 4>It's preposterous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's ridiculous that these are the </v>

3078
02:08:19.091 --> 02:08:20.260
<v Speaker 4>people we have to choose from.</v>

3079
02:08:20.650 --> 02:08:23.050
<v Speaker 4>Whether you like Donald Trump,</v>
<v Speaker 4>will you like Hillary Clinton?</v>

3080
02:08:23.230 --> 02:08:26.110
<v Speaker 4>You have to realize this point.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is not the smart way to do it.</v>

3081
02:08:26.111 --> 02:08:30.400
<v Speaker 4>I'm packing it up tight and ball it up </v>
<v Speaker 4>with your toms before I,</v>

3082
02:08:30.401 --> 02:08:33.490
<v Speaker 4>it's like lawn trimmings.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just dropped it off inside my mouth.</v>

3083
02:08:35.340 --> 02:08:35.780

<v Speaker 4>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had you on at work on the radio and it</v>

3120
02:10:02.791 --> 02:10:04.630
<v Speaker 4>had to turn it off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What happened?</v>

3121
02:10:04.960 --> 02:10:06.900
<v Speaker 4>What happened?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's go.</v>

3122
02:10:06.910 --> 02:10:09.980
<v Speaker 4>I want to shout out to all the blue </v>
<v Speaker 4>collar workers out there listening.</v>

3123
02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:12.850
<v Speaker 4>Then shout out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>shout out my people and gentlemen.</v>

3124
02:10:13.360 --> 02:10:14.193
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd be laying hardwood floors had I not </v>

3125
02:10:16.060 --> 02:10:16.893
<v Speaker 4>pick up by the USA.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Probably are in another universe </v>

3126
02:10:18.550 --> 02:10:21.070
<v Speaker 4>somewhere out there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>An infinite number of times.</v>

3127
02:10:21.140 --> 02:10:23.500
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] hard hardwood floors and you</v>
<v Speaker 4>watch it.</v>

3128
02:10:23.501 --> 02:10:28.501
<v Speaker 4>Some other dude fight the same fights </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you've fought cheering his ass on.</v>

3129
02:10:28.930 --> 02:10:31.660
<v Speaker 4>Maybe maybe mad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would probably be mad.</v>

3130
02:10:32.080 --> 02:10:35.360
<v Speaker 4>Pissed off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel like I would be mad.</v>

3131
02:10:35.450 --> 02:10:38.270
<v Speaker 4>You probably would be mad and he took </v>
<v Speaker 4>the wrong.</v>

3132
02:10:38.450 --> 02:10:40.220
<v Speaker 4>Here's what I think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think to you are you,</v>

3133
02:10:40.221 --> 02:10:43.340
<v Speaker 4>who is you right now is a result of a </v>
<v Speaker 4>lot of these decisions.</v>

3134
02:10:43.550 --> 02:10:47.690
<v Speaker 4>So it'd be really interesting to see who</v>
<v Speaker 4>you would be if you didn't make the same</v>

3135
02:10:47.691 --> 02:10:48.524
<v Speaker 4>decisions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like who are you if you decide to never </v>

3136
02:10:50.571 --> 02:10:52.610
<v Speaker 4>go into that rec room and learn how to </v>
<v Speaker 4>fight,</v>

3137
02:10:52.640 --> 02:10:55.610
<v Speaker 4>who are you?</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you have a fight and lose,</v>

3138
02:10:55.611 --> 02:10:57.140
<v Speaker 4>you never come back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You never get better.</v>

3139
02:10:57.170 --> 02:10:58.300
<v Speaker 4>Who are you?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

3140
02:10:58.310 --> 02:10:59.143
<v Speaker 4>I think w who you are right now a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 4>times is decided by a lot of the shit </v>

3141
02:11:03.201 --> 02:11:04.730
<v Speaker 4>you've already done and how you feel </v>
<v Speaker 4>about it.</v>

3142
02:11:06.050 --> 02:11:08.570
<v Speaker 4>Who I am.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If I didn't walk into that record,</v>

3143
02:11:08.600 --> 02:11:08.900
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

3144
02:11:08.900 --> 02:11:10.910
<v Speaker 4>My Dad always telling me whenever I'd </v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck up.</v>

3145
02:11:10.911 --> 02:11:13.850
<v Speaker 4>So I was like the worst kid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bad.</v>

3146
02:11:13.950 --> 02:11:15.710
<v Speaker 4>Definitely not the worst kid I heard he </v>
<v Speaker 4>got killed.</v>

3147
02:11:15.711 --> 02:11:17.840
<v Speaker 4>He stabbed his two year old sister.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't do that.</v>

3148
02:11:17.841 --> 02:11:20.210
<v Speaker 4>That's the worst I shot my sister and </v>
<v Speaker 4>the head of the slingshot.</v>

3149
02:11:20.380 --> 02:11:21.980
<v Speaker 4>Oops.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Pretty close.</v>

3150
02:11:22.800 --> 02:11:24.700
<v Speaker 4>A childish mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Child of a shake.</v>

3151
02:11:24.710 --> 02:11:25.543
<v Speaker 4>So I feel like it was a rough childhood.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He now and I could only have sex on my </v>

3152
02:11:30.021 --> 02:11:35.021
<v Speaker 4>back cause I could only fuck up sell.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I should be the title of your book.</v>

3153
02:11:36.380 --> 02:11:37.280
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And my dad would say,</v>

3154
02:11:37.281 --> 02:11:39.290
<v Speaker 4>if only you could use your powers for </v>
<v Speaker 4>good instead of evil,</v>

3155
02:11:39.291 --> 02:11:41.240
<v Speaker 4>you would make yourself out to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>something great.</v>

3156
02:11:41.241 --> 02:11:42.074
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And here I am so well telling people to </v>

3157
02:11:44.180 --> 02:11:47.340
<v Speaker 4>suck eyeballs out a monkey brains and </v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody,</v>

3158
02:11:47.370 --> 02:11:48.203
<v Speaker 4>Andy fucking different everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And for someone who is like you to </v>

3159
02:11:52.311 --> 02:11:53.144
<v Speaker 4>pretend to be like your accountant is </v>
<v Speaker 4>just as ridiculous as your accountant </v>

3160
02:11:55.910 --> 02:11:56.780
<v Speaker 4>pretending to be you.</v>

3161
02:11:56.850 --> 02:11:57.683
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Key to this life is find out who you </v>

3162
02:11:58.911 --> 02:11:59.744
<v Speaker 4>are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that is the hardest question to </v>

3163
02:12:01.401 --> 02:12:03.470
<v Speaker 4>answer because who you are changes every</v>
<v Speaker 4>day.</v>

3164
02:12:04.250 --> 02:12:06.860
<v Speaker 4>It's like you gotta be true to whoever </v>
<v Speaker 4>you are at the moment.</v>

3165
02:12:06.920 --> 02:12:10.190
<v Speaker 4>Do you believe that who you are is a sum</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the five people you hang out with?</v>

3166
02:12:10.490 --> 02:12:11.540
<v Speaker 4>It helps.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It helps.</v>

3167
02:12:11.541 --> 02:12:13.850
<v Speaker 4>It definitely helps.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We feed off each other for sure.</v>

3168
02:12:14.170 --> 02:12:15.003
<v Speaker 4>You got to surround yourself as much as </v>
<v Speaker 4>you can with people that care about you </v>

3169
02:12:18.610 --> 02:12:19.443
<v Speaker 4>and people that are there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have the same sort of ambitions </v>

3170
02:12:23.271 --> 02:12:25.430
<v Speaker 4>that you have in terms of like they have</v>
<v Speaker 4>the same,</v>

3171
02:12:25.460 --> 02:12:27.650
<v Speaker 4>they have work ethic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're not lazy,</v>

3172
02:12:27.680 --> 02:12:28.970
<v Speaker 4>they don't fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't,</v>

3173
02:12:29.030 --> 02:12:29.863
<v Speaker 4>they don't ruin their life constantly </v>
<v Speaker 4>because those people become like energy </v>

3174
02:12:32.931 --> 02:12:33.830
<v Speaker 4>drains,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

3175
02:12:34.010 --> 02:12:34.843
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not like you should totally </v>

3176
02:12:35.361 --> 02:12:37.460
<v Speaker 4>abandoned them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you got to be real with them.</v>

3177
02:12:37.880 --> 02:12:39.110
<v Speaker 4>You've got to let them know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You've got to say,</v>

3178
02:12:39.111 --> 02:12:39.944
<v Speaker 4>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is what's going on and this is how </v>

3179
02:12:41.600 --> 02:12:44.250
<v Speaker 4>everybody's sort of looking at,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

3180
02:12:44.290 --> 02:12:46.460
<v Speaker 4>you keep doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't do this anymore.</v>

3181
02:12:46.640 --> 02:12:49.160
<v Speaker 4>Why do you keep doing this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because you get attention when you do it</v>

3182
02:12:49.460 --> 02:12:52.800
<v Speaker 4>because it's easier than succeeding </v>
<v Speaker 4>because I,</v>

3183
02:12:53.150 --> 02:12:58.150
<v Speaker 4>I think especially in your line of work,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that self sabotage is a primary,</v>

3184
02:12:59.750 --> 02:13:01.370
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>escape valve.</v>

3185
02:13:01.510 --> 02:13:05.450
<v Speaker 4>That's who is the leader in the self </v>
<v Speaker 4>sabotages man.</v>

3186
02:13:05.480 --> 02:13:07.970
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you go to fighters like old school.</v>

3187
02:13:07.971 --> 02:13:10.520
<v Speaker 4>I mean old school fighters like Roberto </v>
<v Speaker 4>Duran,</v>

3188
02:13:10.700 --> 02:13:12.080
<v Speaker 4>like Roberto Duran,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3189
02:13:12.110 --> 02:13:12.943
<v Speaker 4>Beet sugar ray Leonard and Duran.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And one of the four horsemen man packs </v>

3190
02:13:15.171 --> 02:13:16.004
<v Speaker 4>on foods.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's eaten like a fucking pig gets </v>

3191
02:13:18.081 --> 02:13:19.760
<v Speaker 4>too fat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't train hard.</v>

3192
02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:21.830
<v Speaker 4>Says No moss.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the rematch,</v>

3193
02:13:22.760 --> 02:13:23.593
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tyson in a lot of ways was a self </v>

3194
02:13:25.791 --> 02:13:26.720
<v Speaker 4>saboteurs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

3195
02:13:26.780 --> 02:13:29.180
<v Speaker 4>Aaron Pryor became a crack addict.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3196

<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

3341
02:18:58.150 --> 02:19:00.380
<v Speaker 2>the one guy is at this point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but how does he know his abilities?</v>

3342
02:19:00.381 --> 02:19:03.010
<v Speaker 2>That friends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this isn't some fucking crazy method,</v>

3343
02:19:03.040 --> 02:19:03.611
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

3344
02:19:03.611 --> 02:19:05.170
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we're out there having a good time.</v>

3345
02:19:05.171 --> 02:19:10.171
<v Speaker 2>I'm not drinking for once in my life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm like sober running the boat.</v>

3346
02:19:10.570 --> 02:19:12.190
<v Speaker 2>We're cleaning it at this point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting ready to,</v>

3347
02:19:12.191 --> 02:19:14.170
<v Speaker 2>and I explained that my dogs got out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>this guys.</v>

3348
02:19:14.440 --> 02:19:16.060
<v Speaker 2>And so he says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3349
02:19:16.061 --> 02:19:18.460
<v Speaker 2>they said you have weapons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he's like,</v>

3350
02:19:19.030 --> 02:19:21.220
<v Speaker 2>cowboy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you have guns?</v>

3351
02:19:22.270 --> 02:19:25.360
<v Speaker 2>And he true blooded American.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

3352
02:19:25.420 --> 02:19:26.710
<v Speaker 2>full,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course I have guns.</v>

3353
02:19:27.470 --> 02:19:28.303

3354
02:19:28.520 --> 02:19:31.670
<v Speaker 1>It's in my truck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now the story on the other guy's part</v>

3355
02:19:31.671 --> 02:19:34.040
<v Speaker 1>is looking more realistic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

3356
02:19:34.400 --> 02:19:35.570
<v Speaker 1>I got Dan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

3357
02:19:35.571 --> 02:19:36.404
<v Speaker 1>I have a fucking gun in my truck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they get the gun and they run the </v>

3358
02:19:38.301 --> 02:19:39.560
<v Speaker 1>gun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course not stolen.</v>

3359
02:19:39.561 --> 02:19:41.540
<v Speaker 1>I give him my concealed carry and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

3360
02:19:41.541 --> 02:19:42.374
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we never,</v>

3361
02:19:42.590 --> 02:19:44.750
<v Speaker 1>we never wielded the gun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it never got pulled out.</v>

3362
02:19:44.751 --> 02:19:47.210
<v Speaker 1>It just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just so happens dumb luck that I have</v>

3363
02:19:47.211 --> 02:19:49.340
<v Speaker 1>a gun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

3364
02:19:49.940 --> 02:19:51.530
<v Speaker 1>I mean it all worked itself out in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>end,</v>

3365
02:19:51.531 --> 02:19:54.410
<v Speaker 1>but cops are in a tricky position right </v>
<v Speaker 1>there because like,</v>

3366
02:19:54.430 --> 02:19:54.800
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

3367
02:19:54.800 --> 02:19:55.633
<v Speaker 1>in one way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they don't know what the fuck is </v>

3368
02:19:56.601 --> 02:19:57.590
<v Speaker 1>going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They show up.</v>

3369
02:19:57.680 --> 02:19:58.513
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who the hell knows who the hell knows </v>

<v Speaker 1>And I didn't know.</v>

3371
02:20:01.191 --> 02:20:04.610
<v Speaker 1>They showed up knowing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking that we had done so of course,</v>

3372
02:20:04.611 --> 02:20:05.690
<v Speaker 1>so I'm losing my fucking mind.</v>

3373
02:20:05.690 --> 02:20:06.141
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>

3374
02:20:06.141 --> 02:20:08.120
<v Speaker 1>all this shit in the news.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you can just pull up,</v>

3375
02:20:08.121 --> 02:20:10.430
<v Speaker 1>pull a fucking gun pointing at me saying</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to shoot me.</v>

3376
02:20:10.431 --> 02:20:11.264
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm losing my mind and my buddy mike </v>

3377
02:20:13.250 --> 02:20:15.470
<v Speaker 1>is totally off the fucking radar if they</v>
<v Speaker 1>had like,</v>

3378
02:20:15.471 --> 02:20:18.950
<v Speaker 1>shoot me walking towards these cops.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh No.</v>

3379
02:20:18.980 --> 02:20:19.521
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3380
02:20:19.521 --> 02:20:20.610
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not good.</v>

3381
02:20:20.930 --> 02:20:21.880
<v Speaker 1>It was wild.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in,</v>

3382
02:20:21.881 --> 02:20:23.510
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the grand scheme you think thinking,</v>

3383
02:20:23.760 --> 02:20:24.591
<v Speaker 1>once they told us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3384
02:20:24.591 --> 02:20:26.480
<v Speaker 1>the guy called and said you guys pulled </v>
<v Speaker 1>weapons on them.</v>

3385
02:20:27.230 --> 02:20:29.720
<v Speaker 1>I see where they're coming from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was just fucking outlandish.</v>

3386
02:20:29.721 --> 02:20:32.510
<v Speaker 1>Man worked down though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's so common.</v>

3387
02:20:32.511 --> 02:20:35.210
<v Speaker 1>People do that shit all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so he pulled a gun on him.</v>

3388
02:20:35.540 --> 02:20:37.490
<v Speaker 1>Like what kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I always tell him the cubs,</v>

3389
02:20:37.491 --> 02:20:39.020
<v Speaker 1>like what kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you can't just do that.</v>

3390
02:20:39.020 --> 02:20:39.980
<v Speaker 1>You can just call the cops and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3391
02:20:39.981 --> 02:20:40.930
<v Speaker 1>this guy pulled a gun on me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Little,</v>

3392
02:20:40.940 --> 02:20:43.340
<v Speaker 1>you should get in trouble if you do do </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

3393
02:20:43.370 --> 02:20:45.390
<v Speaker 1>it shouldn't be a free pass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You shouldn't be able to say,</v>

3394
02:20:45.391 --> 02:20:47.330
<v Speaker 1>that guy pulled a gun on me and not go </v>
<v Speaker 1>to jail.</v>

3395
02:20:47.360 --> 02:20:48.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It should be the same.</v>

3396
02:20:48.110 --> 02:20:50.560
<v Speaker 1>If I pulled a gun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get in trouble and he had the got,</v>

3397
02:20:50.561 --> 02:20:51.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't be able to just say,</v>

3398
02:20:51.770 --> 02:20:52.850
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy pulled a gun on me.</v>

3399
02:20:52.970 --> 02:20:54.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it's a conspiracy.</v>

3400
02:20:54.500 --> 02:20:55.333
<v Speaker 1>You're conspiring to tell false </v>
<v Speaker 1>narratives so that you can get a guard </v>

3401
02:20:57.551 --> 02:20:58.384
<v Speaker 1>in trouble for something he never did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other guy winds up going to jail </v>

3402
02:21:00.680 --> 02:21:01.513
<v Speaker 1>like you're fucking terrible person when</v>
<v Speaker 1>a guy in jail for something that he </v>

3403
02:21:03.861 --> 02:21:04.694
<v Speaker 1>absolutely didn't do in the first place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I was and that's why I it a </v>

3404
02:21:07.431 --> 02:21:08.840
<v Speaker 1>couple of the dude I just fought last </v>
<v Speaker 1>night.</v>

3405
02:21:08.840 --> 02:21:09.561
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

3406
02:21:09.561 --> 02:21:11.120
<v Speaker 1>there's eight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's 18 of us on the boat.</v>

3407
02:21:11.510 --> 02:21:12.343
<v Speaker 1>If 18 of us sitting here like you really</v>
<v Speaker 1>think one guy we're going to pull a gun </v>

3408
02:21:16.081 --> 02:21:16.860
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's 18 of us.</v>

3409
02:21:16.860 --> 02:21:17.693
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like any scenario you can think of in </v>

3410
02:21:18.711 --> 02:21:20.710
<v Speaker 1>your life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'd pull a gun like,</v>

3411
02:21:20.720 --> 02:21:21.920
<v Speaker 1>come on man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's when the cops were like,</v>

3412
02:21:21.950 --> 02:21:22.761
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a good point.</v>

3413
02:21:22.761 --> 02:21:23.151
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3414
02:21:23.151 --> 02:21:24.440
<v Speaker 1>what do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you even talking about?</v>

3415
02:21:24.620 --> 02:21:26.420
<v Speaker 1>Did you get the guy over?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did they get out?</v>

3416
02:21:26.421 --> 02:21:30.560
<v Speaker 1>They wouldn't even bring it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So middle isn't that weird too?</v>

3417
02:21:30.561 --> 02:21:32.960
<v Speaker 1>Like you can't even just like I have </v>
<v Speaker 1>Amanda man with the person and go,</v>

3418
02:21:32.961 --> 02:21:33.794
<v Speaker 1>what are you doing man?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3419
02:21:33.860 --> 02:21:34.693
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you can't even have a man to </v>

3420
02:21:35.671 --> 02:21:38.960
<v Speaker 1>man with the cops because you're under </v>
<v Speaker 1>punk status right now.</v>

3421
02:21:38.990 --> 02:21:41.690
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sit down everyone on the fucking curb,</v>

3422
02:21:41.691 --> 02:21:42.471
<v Speaker 1>but it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3423
02:21:42.471 --> 02:21:46.880

<v Speaker 1>which enrages me even more of course,</v>

3424
02:21:47.330 --> 02:21:48.250
<v Speaker 1>but they have to do it.</v>

3425
02:21:48.260 --> 02:21:50.150
<v Speaker 1>They have to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand from their standpoint,</v>

3426
02:21:50.151 --> 02:21:50.984
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have to protect themselves because </v>

3427
02:21:51.831 --> 02:21:53.090
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of idiots out there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

3428
02:21:53.091 --> 02:21:54.370
<v Speaker 1>But Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3429
02:21:54.450 --> 02:21:56.090
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's one of those things where it's,</v>

3430
02:21:56.360 --> 02:21:59.450
<v Speaker 1>there's no winner there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's terrible position to be in for both</v>

3431
02:21:59.451 --> 02:22:00.560
<v Speaker 1>parties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For them.</v>

3432
02:22:00.561 --> 02:22:02.630
<v Speaker 1>They got lied to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone told me you had a gun.</v>

3433
02:22:02.800 --> 02:22:04.430
<v Speaker 1>They'd come in and thinking about their </v>
<v Speaker 1>kids,</v>

3434
02:22:04.431 --> 02:22:05.510
<v Speaker 1>their wife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their life,</v>

3435
02:22:05.720 --> 02:22:08.090
<v Speaker 1>their fucking mother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that no one wants to see them dead.</v>

3436
02:22:08.240 --> 02:22:09.920
<v Speaker 1>They got to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's someone could shoot them.</v>

3437
02:22:09.970 --> 02:22:12.260
<v Speaker 1>This could be who the fuck knows what </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're coming to.</v>

3438
02:22:12.261 --> 02:22:14.180
<v Speaker 1>They're coming to a gun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got a gun.</v>

3439
02:22:14.690 --> 02:22:17.670
<v Speaker 1>He says Chris Brown shit on the news.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No excuses.</v>

3440
02:22:17.990 --> 02:22:19.610
<v Speaker 1>The cops have surrounded Chris Brown's </v>
<v Speaker 1>house.</v>

3441
02:22:19.611 --> 02:22:20.444
<v Speaker 1>They won't let him out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's been there since three o'clock in </v>

3442
02:22:21.951 --> 02:22:22.784
<v Speaker 1>the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The cop showed up three o'clock in the </v>

3443
02:22:23.661 --> 02:22:24.380
<v Speaker 1>morning.</v>

3444
02:22:24.380 --> 02:22:27.480
<v Speaker 1>They're waiting on a warrant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some woman says he pulled a gun on him,</v>

3445
02:22:27.690 --> 02:22:31.050
<v Speaker 1>so he's a held up in his mansion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Helicopters are flying overhead.</v>

3446
02:22:31.200 --> 02:22:32.790
<v Speaker 1>I was watching on the news at the gym </v>
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>

3447
02:22:32.791 --> 02:22:35.190
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck did Chris Brown do?</v>

3448
02:22:35.580 --> 02:22:38.970
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if he did anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some woman says he pulled a gun on him,</v>

3449
02:22:39.240 --> 02:22:40.073
<v Speaker 1>so through after that happened he threw </v>
<v Speaker 1>a Duffel bag out that had weapons and </v>

3450
02:22:43.741 --> 02:22:45.720
<v Speaker 1>drugs in it apparently then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3451
02:22:45.721 --> 02:22:46.554
<v Speaker 1>that's smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3452
02:22:46.920 --> 02:22:48.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Damn.</v>

3453
02:22:48.690 --> 02:22:49.523
<v Speaker 1>Well I for one have never thought Chris </v>
<v Speaker 1>Brown to be a guy who makes irrational </v>

3454
02:22:52.590 --> 02:22:55.080
<v Speaker 1>decisions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I look at that gentleman.</v>

3455
02:22:55.200 --> 02:22:56.033
<v Speaker 1>I might,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the guy that I come to when I'm </v>

3456
02:22:57.511 --> 02:23:01.920
<v Speaker 1>confused and I need some guidance and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Nisa guidance like you already fuck.</v>

3457
02:23:01.921 --> 02:23:03.690
<v Speaker 1>Maybe he should be a manager.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>

3458
02:23:04.560 --> 02:23:06.840
<v Speaker 1>How old this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have many levels of management.</v>

3459
02:23:06.960 --> 02:23:08.250
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you come to me.</v>

3460
02:23:08.251 --> 02:23:10.850
<v Speaker 1>I go to Chris Brown and then we figured </v>
<v Speaker 1>work the shit out.</v>

3461
02:23:13.820 --> 02:23:17.700
<v Speaker 1>Two duffle bags with guns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's hilarious.</v>

3462
02:23:17.701 --> 02:23:19.890
<v Speaker 1>I swallowed some of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to spin it out.</v>

3463
02:23:20.130 --> 02:23:21.420
<v Speaker 1>Most of it I got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nah,</v>

3464
02:23:21.430 --> 02:23:23.910
<v Speaker 1>that's already swelled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got most of it still stuck in there.</v>

3465
02:23:23.911 --> 02:23:25.480
<v Speaker 1>But it's hard to keep it in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>

3466
02:23:25.490 --> 02:23:28.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm a rookie at this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

3467
02:23:28.150 --> 02:23:31.750
<v Speaker 1>you're a white belt by the shores.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Blue Belt.</v>

3468
02:23:32.260 --> 02:23:34.170
<v Speaker 1>I'll be a stripe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was trying to a belt,</v>

3469
02:23:35.190 --> 02:23:36.060
<v Speaker 1>white belt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blue stripe.</v>

3470
02:23:36.590 --> 02:23:36.961
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3471
02:23:36.961 --> 02:23:37.591
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing,</v>

3472
02:23:37.591 --> 02:23:40.290
<v Speaker 1>I have nothing against the armed forces </v>
<v Speaker 1>or I mean at all.</v>

3473
02:23:40.291 --> 02:23:41.770
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I just,</v>

3474
02:23:41.800 --> 02:23:42.633
<v Speaker 1>it just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was the video I sent to you and </v>

3475
02:23:43.441 --> 02:23:45.190
<v Speaker 1>you're just fucking outlandish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

3476
02:23:45.270 --> 02:23:46.860
<v Speaker 1>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I recognize,</v>

3477
02:23:46.861 --> 02:23:49.830
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's a hard position to be a cop.</v>

3478
02:23:50.250 --> 02:23:51.660
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

3479
02:23:51.750 --> 02:23:54.150
<v Speaker 1>I also suddenly knuckleheads out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You never know.</v>

3480
02:23:54.180 --> 02:23:57.480
<v Speaker 1>I just basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially everybody carrying weapons,</v>

3481
02:23:57.481 --> 02:23:58.970
<v Speaker 1>these dentists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

3482
02:23:59.600 --> 02:24:00.480
<v Speaker 1>And you know what?</v>

3483
02:24:00.600 --> 02:24:02.520
<v Speaker 1>Here's the other thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's where it's tougher cops.</v>

3484
02:24:02.730 --> 02:24:04.320
<v Speaker 1>A lot of cops are second amendment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3485
02:24:04.350 --> 02:24:06.100
<v Speaker 1>believers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they,</v>

3486
02:24:06.180 --> 02:24:10.950
<v Speaker 1>they support the right of a citizen to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to hold arms,</v>

3487
02:24:10.951 --> 02:24:11.784
<v Speaker 1>to have guns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to use them in a responsible and </v>

3488
02:24:13.591 --> 02:24:14.910
<v Speaker 1>legal manner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

3489
02:24:14.911 --> 02:24:17.580
<v Speaker 1>so you want a lot of cops from my theory</v>
<v Speaker 1>on this.</v>

3490
02:24:17.730 --> 02:24:19.020
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not really my theory on on,</v>

3491
02:24:19.021 --> 02:24:19.621
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on them,</v>

3492
02:24:19.621 --> 02:24:21.930
<v Speaker 1>but it's my theory of how I think they </v>
<v Speaker 1>think.</v>

3493
02:24:22.290 --> 02:24:24.870
<v Speaker 1>So if I'm taking you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's go back to scuba diving lessons.</v>

3494
02:24:24.871 --> 02:24:26.920
<v Speaker 1>You were scuba diving as an example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I take you to dive,</v>

3495
02:24:27.030 --> 02:24:28.980
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go cave diving with me.</v>

3496
02:24:28.981 --> 02:24:29.850
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're in a cave.</v>

3497
02:24:30.600 --> 02:24:32.550
<v Speaker 1>You run out of air,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3498
02:24:32.740 --> 02:24:35.560
<v Speaker 1>So your only source of life is me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3499
02:24:35.610 --> 02:24:38.400
<v Speaker 1>So you have to grab my air out of my </v>
<v Speaker 1>mouth that we now have to share.</v>

3500
02:24:38.401 --> 02:24:40.650
<v Speaker 1>But what if you're sucking too much air </v>
<v Speaker 1>and using a mine?</v>

3501
02:24:40.650 --> 02:24:44.040
<v Speaker 1>I have to make the decision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going home to my girlfriend,</v>

3502
02:24:44.640 --> 02:24:45.473
<v Speaker 1>my family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I feel like that's the same </v>

3503
02:24:47.011 --> 02:24:47.844
<v Speaker 1>mentality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have to come with any of these </v>

3504
02:24:48.511 --> 02:24:49.344
<v Speaker 1>situations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they're fucking coming home to </v>

3505
02:24:51.121 --> 02:24:53.880
<v Speaker 1>their wife and their kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So no matter rights you get get,</v>

3506
02:24:53.900 --> 02:24:54.733
<v Speaker 1>get rid of carole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm writing here so I'm leaving at the </v>

3507
02:24:56.521 --> 02:24:57.211
<v Speaker 1>end of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm saying.</v>

3508
02:24:57.211 --> 02:24:59.550
<v Speaker 1>At the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you already used your ass mother fucker.</v>

3509
02:24:59.551 --> 02:25:00.440
<v Speaker 1>You ain't using it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mine,</v>

3510
02:25:00.740 --> 02:25:01.580
<v Speaker 1>I undersell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

3511
02:25:01.581 --> 02:25:03.390
<v Speaker 1>I feel like they have to come into these</v>
<v Speaker 1>situations is like,</v>

3512
02:25:04.140 --> 02:25:05.820
<v Speaker 1>listen here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got called on you,</v>

3513
02:25:05.821 --> 02:25:08.430
<v Speaker 1>you pieces of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know the situation,</v>

3514
02:25:08.431 --> 02:25:11.130
<v Speaker 1>but in my mind I'm going home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So whatever,</v>

3515
02:25:11.140 --> 02:25:12.380
<v Speaker 1>whatever that means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3516
02:25:12.570 --> 02:25:14.580
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not mad at him for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not either.</v>

3517
02:25:15.150 --> 02:25:17.970
<v Speaker 1>I understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand the survival instinct and I</v>

3518
02:25:17.971 --> 02:25:19.510
<v Speaker 1>understand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if they don't know you,</v>

3519
02:25:19.750 --> 02:25:20.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're,</v>

3520
02:25:20.380 --> 02:25:23.130
<v Speaker 1>I assume if a scuba dive when someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's someone who's a really close,</v>

3521
02:25:23.360 --> 02:25:24.160
<v Speaker 1>and that'd be a real heart</v>

3522
02:25:24.160 --> 02:25:24.993
<v Speaker 4>issue.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It would be.</v>

3523
02:25:25.060 --> 02:25:26.140
<v Speaker 4>That'd be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that'd be way,</v>

3524
02:25:26.141 --> 02:25:26.921
<v Speaker 4>way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>way harder.</v>

3525
02:25:26.921 --> 02:25:27.754
<v Speaker 4>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you show up at some scene and some </v>

3526
02:25:29.501 --> 02:25:32.830
<v Speaker 4>dude is supposedly assault with a deadly</v>
<v Speaker 4>weapon and you don't know,</v>

3527
02:25:32.831 --> 02:25:35.200
<v Speaker 4>and you're wearing a vest and your guns </v>
<v Speaker 4>drawn,</v>

3528
02:25:35.260 --> 02:25:36.093
<v Speaker 4>who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who knows what the fuck's going to go </v>

3529
02:25:36.791 --> 02:25:40.840
<v Speaker 4>down to talk with this stuff in your </v>
<v Speaker 4>lip.</v>

3530
02:25:40.870 --> 02:25:42.520
<v Speaker 4>But you do know you're coming home to </v>
<v Speaker 4>your,</v>

3531
02:25:43.180 --> 02:25:44.790
<v Speaker 4>your wife and your kids.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3532
02:25:44.800 --> 02:25:46.200
<v Speaker 4>A lot of dudes make that decision.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3533
02:25:46.270 --> 02:25:47.103
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of dudes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure though that would be in that </v>

3534
02:25:48.131 --> 02:25:48.964
<v Speaker 4>scuba diving scenario and say I would </v>
<v Speaker 4>rather die with my friend then let them </v>

3535
02:25:51.791 --> 02:25:54.850
<v Speaker 4>die down here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's tricky then don't ever come with me</v>

3536
02:25:54.851 --> 02:25:59.590
<v Speaker 4>because I don't ever call me cause I'm </v>
<v Speaker 4>going home.</v>

3537
02:26:00.360 --> 02:26:02.680
<v Speaker 4>I'm going home.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know that for sure.</v>

3538
02:26:03.100 --> 02:26:04.090
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have gone home.</v>

3539
02:26:04.091 --> 02:26:05.980
<v Speaker 4>That is the issue with that cave diving </v>
<v Speaker 4>shit.</v>

3540
02:26:05.980 --> 02:26:06.813
<v Speaker 4>I watched this cave diving thing where </v>
<v Speaker 4>they were exploring these ancient Mayan </v>

3541
02:26:10.301 --> 02:26:11.980
<v Speaker 4>sites.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

3542
02:26:12.160 --> 02:26:12.993
<v Speaker 4>and the only way to get to them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was going through these caves and </v>

3543
02:26:14.921 --> 02:26:17.920
<v Speaker 4>they would go to these caves and find </v>
<v Speaker 4>all these ancient Mayan ruins,</v>

3544
02:26:18.130 --> 02:26:20.830
<v Speaker 4>but they're going through these case for</v>
<v Speaker 4>like hundreds of yards,</v>

3545
02:26:21.010 --> 02:26:24.520
<v Speaker 4>hundreds of yards in a cave under the </v>
<v Speaker 4>ocean.</v>

3546
02:26:24.521 --> 02:26:26.620
<v Speaker 4>We breathed out of a fucking mask.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

3547
02:26:26.650 --> 02:26:28.330
<v Speaker 4>oh Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't.</v>

3548
02:26:28.420 --> 02:26:30.070
<v Speaker 4>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I fucking love it.</v>

3549
02:26:30.430 --> 02:26:31.263
<v Speaker 4>I know you do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I took my bite and my buddies always </v>

3550
02:26:32.381 --> 02:26:34.630
<v Speaker 4>ask,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they want to go scuba diving with me and</v>

3551
02:26:34.631 --> 02:26:36.660
<v Speaker 4>they want to go k diving.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I took him up to this.</v>

3552
02:26:36.700 --> 02:26:38.050
<v Speaker 4>We have a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we have a cave in the mountains.</v>

3553
02:26:38.051 --> 02:26:39.640
<v Speaker 4>So I just took him in the cave.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Of course you do.</v>

3554
02:26:39.670 --> 02:26:41.560
<v Speaker 4>We went in with this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is dry.</v>

3555
02:26:41.590 --> 02:26:42.550
<v Speaker 4>We walked in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3556
02:26:42.551 --> 02:26:43.810
<v Speaker 4>Walk into the cave with lights.</v>

3557
02:26:44.050 --> 02:26:46.480
<v Speaker 4>I made them turn the lights off and find</v>
<v Speaker 4>their way out.</v>

3558
02:26:47.140 --> 02:26:47.471
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>

3559
02:26:47.471 --> 02:26:49.480
<v Speaker 4>you want it let,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's worst case scenario here.</v>

3560
02:26:49.540 --> 02:26:51.320
<v Speaker 4>What the fuck y'all going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they freak out.</v>

3561
02:26:51.321 --> 02:26:52.630
<v Speaker 4>And every,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everyone I've had to turn the light on,</v>

3562
02:26:52.631 --> 02:26:53.051
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

3563
02:26:53.051 --> 02:26:56.080
<v Speaker 4>this cannot happen in the cave diving </v>
<v Speaker 4>because if we're own to the water and we</v>

3564
02:26:56.081 --> 02:27:00.040
<v Speaker 4>lose our torch or we lose our air </v>
<v Speaker 4>pandemonium going to fucking break out.</v>

3565
02:27:00.420 --> 02:27:01.810
<v Speaker 4>So I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you guys fail.</v>

3566
02:27:01.811 --> 02:27:03.130
<v Speaker 4>I'm definitely not going down with you </v>
<v Speaker 4>guys.</v>

3567
02:27:03.131 --> 02:27:03.880
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3568
02:27:03.880 --> 02:27:05.740
<v Speaker 4>just to give them that little touch of </v>
<v Speaker 4>what it's like,</v>

3569
02:27:05.741 --> 02:27:06.640
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't,</v>

3570
02:27:06.850 --> 02:27:07.683
<v Speaker 4>you really don't know who you are as a </v>
<v Speaker 4>person until you're put in one of those </v>

3571
02:27:09.461 --> 02:27:12.550
<v Speaker 4>positions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you can talk big and bold until you</v>

3572
02:27:12.730 --> 02:27:13.563
<v Speaker 4>practice [inaudible] been there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which don't you feel the same way about </v>

3573
02:27:15.581 --> 02:27:18.180
<v Speaker 4>fighting know apps a fucking little.</v>

3574
02:27:18.180 --> 02:27:19.013
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like that's one of the weird things </v>

3575
02:27:19.691 --> 02:27:20.524
<v Speaker 4>about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3576
02:27:20.650 --> 02:27:22.040
<v Speaker 4>people doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3577
02:27:22.060 --> 02:27:22.893
<v Speaker 4>like a writing articles about fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's one things I've had a real problem </v>

3578
02:27:25.781 --> 02:27:26.614
<v Speaker 4>with in the past where I've,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've even gone overboard like to go </v>

3579
02:27:28.751 --> 02:27:29.584
<v Speaker 4>after them because I get real angry when</v>
<v Speaker 4>people write like real disrespectful </v>

3580
02:27:33.311 --> 02:27:35.100
<v Speaker 4>things about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3581
02:27:35.260 --> 02:27:36.093
<v Speaker 4>about fighters,</v>
<v Speaker 4>about their performances and like </v>

3582
02:27:38.320 --> 02:27:39.153
<v Speaker 4>unnecessarily insulting and not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it looks like we all sort of agree that </v>

3583
02:27:44.681 --> 02:27:46.540
<v Speaker 4>people that put themselves like first </v>
<v Speaker 4>responders,</v>

3584
02:27:46.541 --> 02:27:48.740
<v Speaker 4>like firefighters,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people put themselves in,</v>

3585
02:27:48.741 --> 02:27:50.170
<v Speaker 4>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the line of,</v>

3586
02:27:50.171 --> 02:27:51.120
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>

3587
02:27:51.130 --> 02:27:52.300
<v Speaker 4>of danger in the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the,</v>

3588
02:27:52.390 --> 02:27:55.780
<v Speaker 4>in front of danger for us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We give them like this,</v>

3589
02:27:55.781 --> 02:27:58.270

<v Speaker 4>our entertainment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3592
02:28:03.960 --> 02:28:07.070

3593
02:28:07.090 --> 02:28:07.923
<v Speaker 4>like rightly so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's some things that are just </v>

3594
02:28:08.561 --> 02:28:11.140
<v Speaker 4>fucking ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's some ridiculous shit that people</v>

<v Speaker 4>park core.</v>

3597
02:28:14.141 --> 02:28:16.270
<v Speaker 4>People are jumping from building to </v>
<v Speaker 4>building.</v>

3598

<v Speaker 3>Just looking at his instagram feed.</v>

3604
02:28:26.691 --> 02:28:27.524
<v Speaker 3>I can't imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>imagine talking to him about stories in </v>

3605
02:28:29.151 --> 02:28:30.890
<v Speaker 3>person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but um,</v>

3606
02:28:32.030 --> 02:28:34.580
<v Speaker 3>but with fighters I feel like that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>such a,</v>

3607
02:28:35.120 --> 02:28:40.120
<v Speaker 3>it's a fucking scary and a lot of ways </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a noble pursuit because it's so God</v>

3608
02:28:40.180 --> 02:28:41.013
<v Speaker 3>damn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the antithesis of what your </v>

3609
02:28:43.131 --> 02:28:45.200
<v Speaker 3>instincts tell you to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fight or flight.</v>

3610
02:28:45.260 --> 02:28:46.093
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your instincts are telling you get the </v>

3611
02:28:47.781 --> 02:28:49.430
<v Speaker 3>fuck out of this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't do this.</v>

3612
02:28:49.431 --> 02:28:51.050
<v Speaker 3>You could get hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is bad.</v>

3613
02:28:51.051 --> 02:28:53.540
<v Speaker 3>We don't know what's going to happen is </v>
<v Speaker 3>this is open ended.</v>

3614
02:28:53.541 --> 02:28:57.260
<v Speaker 3>Anything could go wrong and you have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>prepare for this moment,</v>

3615
02:28:57.261 --> 02:28:58.640
<v Speaker 3>for months.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

3616
02:28:58.670 --> 02:28:59.503
<v Speaker 3>really for years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like by the time you get to a point </v>

3617
02:29:00.951 --> 02:29:01.784
<v Speaker 3>where you're fighting rick story,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't just dive in and fight Rick </v>

3618
02:29:03.950 --> 02:29:04.020
<v Speaker 3>Story.</v>

3619
02:29:04.020 --> 02:29:04.853
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got to fight all these other people </v>

3620
02:29:05.571 --> 02:29:06.460
<v Speaker 3>along the way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3621
02:29:06.510 --> 02:29:09.530
<v Speaker 3>You got to build up the ability,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the skills and the,</v>

3622
02:29:09.560 --> 02:29:10.580
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have,</v>

3623
02:29:10.581 --> 02:29:14.780
<v Speaker 3>there's a confident path in your mind </v>
<v Speaker 3>that when shit is going down,</v>

3624
02:29:14.781 --> 02:29:15.614
<v Speaker 3>you know how to fight and you know how </v>
<v Speaker 3>to execute and you were confident that </v>

3625
02:29:19.461 --> 02:29:22.100
<v Speaker 3>when you get in there and all that </v>
<v Speaker 3>pressure's on you,</v>

3626
02:29:22.280 --> 02:29:23.210
<v Speaker 3>you can do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

3627
02:29:23.211 --> 02:29:25.970
<v Speaker 3>Because you've done it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So for someone who's on the outside,</v>

3628
02:29:26.660 --> 02:29:29.500
<v Speaker 3>I think it's imperative it really in </v>
<v Speaker 3>this sport to,</v>

3629
02:29:29.610 --> 02:29:30.443
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially when you consider the fact </v>

3630
02:29:31.731 --> 02:29:34.520
<v Speaker 3>that it's so devastating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like when a fighter loses,</v>

3631
02:29:34.970 --> 02:29:36.590
<v Speaker 3>it can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it can define their life.</v>

3632
02:29:36.591 --> 02:29:38.360
<v Speaker 3>It's very difficult for them to </v>
<v Speaker 3>overcome,</v>

3633
02:29:38.500 --> 02:29:39.770
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and are difficult.</v>

3634
02:29:40.130 --> 02:29:42.560
<v Speaker 3>It's the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the lowest low you could ever feel.</v>

3635
02:29:42.650 --> 02:29:45.410
<v Speaker 3>What is the worst loss you ever had for </v>
<v Speaker 3>the title?</v>

3636
02:29:45.411 --> 02:29:50.120
<v Speaker 3>When dosantos got me this last time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wanted to turn my phone off and hide,</v>

3637
02:29:50.121 --> 02:29:51.290
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like the worst.</v>

3638
02:29:52.610 --> 02:29:57.610
<v Speaker 3>And then you realize the sun still comes</v>
<v Speaker 3>up and Joe Rogan's still calls me.</v>

3639
02:29:59.060 --> 02:29:59.893
<v Speaker 3>He always like the world doesn't end,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they love you if you lose or if you </v>

3640
02:30:04.131 --> 02:30:04.964
<v Speaker 3>win.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is no way you can know if </v>

3641
02:30:05.901 --> 02:30:06.740
<v Speaker 3>you're going to lose,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to win.</v>

3642
02:30:06.741 --> 02:30:08.900
<v Speaker 3>Especially,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't say that you're the winning,</v>

3643
02:30:08.950 --> 02:30:11.630
<v Speaker 3>honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just a byproduct of performing wes.</v>

3644
02:30:12.050 --> 02:30:12.883
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3645
02:30:13.310 --> 02:30:16.070
<v Speaker 3>And you can't say you're the baddest </v>
<v Speaker 3>motherfucker on earth until you meet the</v>

3646
02:30:16.071 --> 02:30:19.670
<v Speaker 3>baddest motherfucker on earth and </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's the new new bad one coming right</v>

3647
02:30:19.671 --> 02:30:21.020
<v Speaker 3>behind him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's always,</v>

3648
02:30:21.080 --> 02:30:22.490
<v Speaker 3>that's gotta be the weirdest thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3649
02:30:22.491 --> 02:30:23.324
<v Speaker 3>Then nipping at your heels,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how many people would call an out </v>

3650
02:30:27.471 --> 02:30:28.880
<v Speaker 3>cowboy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good Lord.</v>

3651
02:30:29.620 --> 02:30:30.890
<v Speaker 3>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 3>You get right?</v>

3653
02:30:33.250 --> 02:30:34.850
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone wants a piece of the pie,</v>

3654
02:30:34.851 --> 02:30:36.800

<v Speaker 3>But do they really?</v>

3656
02:30:41.040 --> 02:30:41.873

<v Speaker 3>And until it comes down to tell Dana </v>

3657

<v Speaker 3>Matt Brow wants it because a few of </v>
<v Speaker 3>those guys like,</v>

3663
02:30:55.611 --> 02:30:57.400
<v Speaker 3>and that's one of the reasons why win,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lose or draw.</v>

3664
02:30:57.410 --> 02:30:59.990
<v Speaker 3>Matt Brown always gets massive respect.</v>

3687
02:31:49.290 --> 02:31:51.410
<v Speaker 1>And you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he came in after his last loss last.</v>

3688
02:31:51.420 --> 02:31:53.490
<v Speaker 1>That's that guy two times in a row by </v>
<v Speaker 1>knockout.</v>

3689
02:31:53.491 --> 02:31:55.560
<v Speaker 1>But he was winning the whole fight until</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

3690
02:31:55.920 --> 02:31:56.753
<v Speaker 1>Fair enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3691
02:31:56.820 --> 02:31:57.653
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he came in with a great attitude about </v>

3692
02:31:59.731 --> 02:32:00.564
<v Speaker 1>it and I think part of the great </v>
<v Speaker 1>attitude about was losing to him by </v>

3693
02:32:02.521 --> 02:32:03.420
<v Speaker 1>knockout before.</v>

3694
02:32:03.480 --> 02:32:04.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it wasn't like,</v>

3695
02:32:04.711 --> 02:32:05.700
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like uh,</v>

3696
02:32:05.701 --> 02:32:08.340
<v Speaker 1>I have resigned myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not as good as I thought it was.</v>

3697
02:32:08.370 --> 02:32:08.911
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

3698
02:32:08.911 --> 02:32:10.920
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you fucking lay those chips out.</v>

3699
02:32:10.921 --> 02:32:13.830
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he was playing the most dangerous</v>

3700
02:32:13.831 --> 02:32:14.664
<v Speaker 1>game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was playing just empty gas tank and </v>

3701
02:32:16.981 --> 02:32:20.010
<v Speaker 1>attack and be as aggressive as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was winning at it.</v>

3702
02:32:20.040 --> 02:32:22.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he got clipped and,</v>

3703
02:32:22.190 --> 02:32:24.170
<v Speaker 1>but he came in with a great attitude </v>
<v Speaker 1>about man.</v>

3704
02:32:24.990 --> 02:32:25.823
<v Speaker 1>Great attitude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think very many people </v>

3705
02:32:26.491 --> 02:32:28.950
<v Speaker 1>appreciate what it takes to go out there</v>
<v Speaker 1>and do that.</v>

3706
02:32:29.070 --> 02:32:30.720
<v Speaker 1>To not play safe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to just knock him,</v>

3707
02:32:30.900 --> 02:32:33.900
<v Speaker 1>put the gas pedal to the floor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you can.</v>

3708
02:32:34.020 --> 02:32:34.853
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think anybody can unless you've </v>

3709
02:32:35.881 --> 02:32:37.500
<v Speaker 1>done it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're there watching that.</v>

3710
02:32:37.501 --> 02:32:38.334
<v Speaker 1>I think it has to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's one of the easiest thing </v>

3711
02:32:40.231 --> 02:32:44.220
<v Speaker 1>that someone can do online,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like trolls and people got of them.</v>

3712
02:32:44.730 --> 02:32:48.240
<v Speaker 1>Got To love him in some ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>

3713
02:32:48.300 --> 02:32:50.730
<v Speaker 1>If I was 14,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd probably be doing the same shit.</v>

3714
02:32:51.870 --> 02:32:54.150
<v Speaker 1>I was 22.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might've been doing the same shit.</v>

3715
02:32:54.210 --> 02:32:55.890
<v Speaker 1>Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially if you're anonymous.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's always done by losers.</v>

3721
02:33:07.110 --> 02:33:09.390

02:34:43.751 --> 02:34:46.660
<v Speaker 1>possibly think of who's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Second one.</v>

3771
02:34:46.661 --> 02:34:49.210
<v Speaker 1>He just went out and choked me out in </v>
<v Speaker 1>three seconds.</v>

3772
02:34:49.211 --> 02:34:50.044
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the third one and then third </v>

3773
02:34:51.711 --> 02:34:54.430
<v Speaker 1>one I won.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people say I didn't win,</v>

3774
02:34:54.431 --> 02:34:56.680
<v Speaker 1>but a super close,</v>
<v Speaker 1>super close fight,</v>

3775
02:34:56.920 --> 02:34:58.840
<v Speaker 1>real close fight those fights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3776
02:34:58.841 --> 02:34:59.674
<v Speaker 1>I honestly believe that the scoring </v>
<v Speaker 1>system is ridiculously inadequate and </v>

3777
02:35:03.731 --> 02:35:07.960
<v Speaker 1>it's best exam like Joe Lozan versus um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3778
02:35:08.020 --> 02:35:09.250
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jim Miller.</v>

3779
02:35:09.570 --> 02:35:11.530
<v Speaker 1>I'll watch that again today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

3780
02:35:11.531 --> 02:35:12.910
<v Speaker 1>God damn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good luck scoring.</v>

3781
02:35:12.911 --> 02:35:15.550
<v Speaker 1>This is a chaotic fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3782
02:35:15.551 --> 02:35:16.840
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's so much going on.</v>

3783
02:35:16.841 --> 02:35:19.690
<v Speaker 1>How much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much politics do you think fall into</v>

3784
02:35:20.080 --> 02:35:20.913
<v Speaker 1>the scoring?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How?</v>

3785
02:35:21.370 --> 02:35:22.203
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see the judges and they're kind of </v>

3786
02:35:24.161 --> 02:35:24.880
<v Speaker 1>usually elderly.</v>

3787
02:35:24.880 --> 02:35:26.620
<v Speaker 1>They're not really young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>young guys.</v>

3788
02:35:27.430 --> 02:35:30.670
<v Speaker 1>How much of me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I kinda like,</v>

3789
02:35:30.880 --> 02:35:33.850
<v Speaker 1>I kinda liked cowboy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like his vibe.</v>

3790
02:35:33.851 --> 02:35:34.684
<v Speaker 1>I like his energy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I maybe I'm going to tip the scale a </v>

3791
02:35:36.671 --> 02:35:37.930
<v Speaker 1>little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a good question.</v>

3792
02:35:38.050 --> 02:35:40.870
<v Speaker 1>They could on unquestionably be biased.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

3793
02:35:40.900 --> 02:35:42.780
<v Speaker 1>Vans are biased.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm biased.</v>

3794
02:35:42.781 --> 02:35:45.010
<v Speaker 1>People are biased so we use definitely </v>
<v Speaker 1>biased.</v>

3795
02:35:45.130 --> 02:35:45.963
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes I have to watch the fights on </v>
<v Speaker 1>mute just because sometimes you got to </v>

3796
02:35:49.001 --> 02:35:51.240
<v Speaker 1>watch the fight on mute and then watch </v>
<v Speaker 1>it with Joe Rogan.</v>

3797
02:35:51.241 --> 02:35:51.821
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>

3798
02:35:51.821 --> 02:35:52.654
<v Speaker 1>He swayed to tick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He tipped the scale on that one for </v>

3799
02:35:54.421 --> 02:35:55.690
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tried not to.</v>

3800
02:35:55.880 --> 02:35:57.670
<v Speaker 1>I try not to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I told you before,</v>

3801
02:35:57.671 --> 02:35:58.990
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm bias towards you though.</v>

3802
02:35:58.991 --> 02:36:00.860
<v Speaker 1>This is a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Appreciate it.</v>

3803
02:36:01.090 --> 02:36:02.940
<v Speaker 1>I'm a legitimate fan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3804
02:36:02.950 --> 02:36:05.230
<v Speaker 1>and I try to be as objective as </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible,</v>

3805
02:36:05.231 --> 02:36:06.820
<v Speaker 1>but the things are happening in a fight.</v>

3806
02:36:06.820 --> 02:36:10.840
<v Speaker 1>You get excited.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I do my best to do it justice,</v>

3807
02:36:10.841 --> 02:36:12.730
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not scoring it right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3808
02:36:12.731 --> 02:36:16.180
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to be entertaining,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but being a commentator is a weird job.</v>

3809
02:36:16.810 --> 02:36:18.610
<v Speaker 1>How much are you going to do it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

3810
02:36:18.790 --> 02:36:22.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing it less and I like it more </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I'm doing it less.</v>

3811
02:36:22.390 --> 02:36:24.010
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you pick the ones you want to do?</v>

3812
02:36:24.290 --> 02:36:26.020
<v Speaker 1>Paper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Paper view one's in North America.</v>

3813
02:36:26.290 --> 02:36:27.670
<v Speaker 1>No more traveling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No more traveling.</v>

3814
02:36:27.671 --> 02:36:30.700
<v Speaker 1>No more Australia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to get on paper view.</v>

3815
02:36:31.270 --> 02:36:32.340
<v Speaker 1>Big chose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I Love Vegas.</v>

3818
02:36:36.880 --> 02:36:37.713
<v Speaker 1>Everything's open.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the worst thing about traveling </v>

3819
02:36:38.711 --> 02:36:39.281
<v Speaker 1>and fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

3820
02:36:39.281 --> 02:36:40.114
<v Speaker 1>You fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first thing you want to do is eat </v>

3821
02:36:41.170 --> 02:36:43.750
<v Speaker 1>right and they 11 o'clock everything's </v>

3826
02:36:52.090 --> 02:36:53.700
<v Speaker 1>Fuck while they're talking about fuck </v>
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

3827

<v Speaker 1>But luck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>

<v Speaker 1>So you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's good for you.</v>

3831
02:36:58.360 --> 02:36:59.193
<v Speaker 1>No it neither one of those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not good for you and it's not not </v>

3832
02:37:01.631 --> 02:37:02.770
<v Speaker 1>good tasting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's good.</v>

3833
02:37:02.771 --> 02:37:03.850
<v Speaker 1>It's delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3834
02:37:03.851 --> 02:37:05.560
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You probably know more than me,</v>

3835
02:37:05.561 --> 02:37:06.370
<v Speaker 1>but I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can't,</v>

3836
02:37:06.370 --> 02:37:11.230
<v Speaker 1>something that tastes way better than </v>
<v Speaker 1>the sub them oily like a giant booger.</v>

3837
02:37:11.530 --> 02:37:13.030
<v Speaker 1>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love it.</v>

3838
02:37:13.060 --> 02:37:15.800
<v Speaker 1>It's delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People mad that you,</v>

3839
02:37:15.830 --> 02:37:16.040
<v Speaker 1>that</v>

3840
02:37:16.040 --> 02:37:19.620
<v Speaker 4>you have to force feed to duck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to force feed the goose to make</v>

3841
02:37:19.621 --> 02:37:20.181
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3842
02:37:20.181 --> 02:37:22.250
<v Speaker 4>have their liver.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The liver inflates.</v>

3843
02:37:22.280 --> 02:37:27.080
<v Speaker 4>It gets larger when they get forced fed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I mean why you still kill him?</v>

3844
02:37:27.230 --> 02:37:28.063
<v Speaker 4>It's so bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like it's okay to kill them and eat </v>

3845
02:37:29.241 --> 02:37:30.074
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But for a while in California it was </v>

3846
02:37:31.011 --> 02:37:33.170
<v Speaker 4>illegal to force feed them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I fed it,</v>

3847
02:37:33.470 --> 02:37:34.303
<v Speaker 4>forced fed a couple of girls goose.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not the same budweiser bad guys </v>

3848
02:37:42.201 --> 02:37:47.201
<v Speaker 4>running down the hallway.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's forced feeding girls is goose.</v>

3849
02:37:49.360 --> 02:37:51.500
<v Speaker 4>Goddammit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People get mad.</v>

3850
02:37:51.710 --> 02:37:53.720
<v Speaker 4>Oh Man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Feed at goose.</v>

3851
02:37:53.780 --> 02:37:55.310
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know that was the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's the thing,</v>

3852
02:37:55.311 --> 02:37:57.080
<v Speaker 4>Anthony Bordain told me that I looked it</v>
<v Speaker 4>up.</v>

3853
02:37:57.320 --> 02:38:00.170
<v Speaker 4>He said they actually gravitate towards </v>
<v Speaker 4>the feeding pipe.</v>

3854
02:38:00.171 --> 02:38:02.660
<v Speaker 4>Like our idea of what a force feeding is</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

3855
02:38:02.661 --> 02:38:05.330
<v Speaker 4>we think it'd be terrible to have </v>
<v Speaker 4>someone dump food down your throat.</v>

3856
02:38:05.600 --> 02:38:07.100
<v Speaker 4>Their throats aren't like our throats.</v>

3857
02:38:07.100 --> 02:38:08.690
<v Speaker 4>Like they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they like it doesn't,</v>

3858
02:38:09.050 --> 02:38:13.280
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't bother them in a way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like there's some is shit that people do</v>

3859
02:38:13.281 --> 02:38:16.610
<v Speaker 4>with factory farming,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like making pigs live side by side,</v>

3860
02:38:16.611 --> 02:38:20.360
<v Speaker 4>crammed in these cages and cows and </v>
<v Speaker 4>living in their own shit.</v>

3861
02:38:20.390 --> 02:38:22.370
<v Speaker 4>But we don't talk about it because we </v>
<v Speaker 4>love Bacon.</v>

3862
02:38:22.820 --> 02:38:24.980
<v Speaker 4>Bacon is good and it's hard to get it </v>
<v Speaker 4>from a wild pig.</v>

3863
02:38:25.070 --> 02:38:26.780
<v Speaker 4>That's the thing about if you love </v>
<v Speaker 4>Bacon,</v>

3864
02:38:27.110 --> 02:38:27.943
<v Speaker 4>you love domesticated pigs folks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The ones who feed the or to and eat the </v>

3865
02:38:32.201 --> 02:38:33.034
<v Speaker 4>bait,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fatten them up.</v>

3866
02:38:33.290 --> 02:38:34.123
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because if you,</v>

3867
02:38:34.360 --> 02:38:35.091
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>feral,</v>

3868
02:38:35.091 --> 02:38:36.170
<v Speaker 4>beefy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>giant,</v>

3869
02:38:36.171 --> 02:38:37.190
<v Speaker 4>muscular pig.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3870
02:38:37.191 --> 02:38:39.740
<v Speaker 4>it does not taste like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well you can get bacon out of it,</v>

3871
02:38:39.741 --> 02:38:42.290
<v Speaker 4>but the bacon,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you see a wild hogs bacon,</v>

3872
02:38:42.460 --> 02:38:46.400
<v Speaker 4>which is bacon is like a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like what's attached to the ribs.</v>

3873
02:38:46.401 --> 02:38:49.400
<v Speaker 4>It's like the lower rib area on a wild </v>
<v Speaker 4>hog.</v>

3874
02:38:49.400 --> 02:38:52.640
<v Speaker 4>That shit is like a quarter of an inch </v>
<v Speaker 4>thick for all of it.</v>

3875
02:38:52.700 --> 02:38:53.533
<v Speaker 4>And then if you like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you get a side of bacon on a fat </v>

3876
02:38:56.571 --> 02:38:57.404
<v Speaker 4>domestic picked out as a fat fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>slab because he's lays around cut a </v>

3877
02:39:01.011 --> 02:39:03.950
<v Speaker 4>feral pig is moving on the move every </v>
<v Speaker 4>day.</v>

3878
02:39:03.951 --> 02:39:05.210
<v Speaker 4>Hustling,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hustling.</v>

3879
02:39:05.300 --> 02:39:06.410
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You remember that old,</v>

3880
02:39:06.490 --> 02:39:08.720
<v Speaker 4>the pork.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the other white meat.</v>

3881
02:39:08.780 --> 02:39:09.810
<v Speaker 4>Remember that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3882
02:39:09.860 --> 02:39:12.170
<v Speaker 4>This is not with wild pigs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's nothing white about it.</v>

3883
02:39:12.320 --> 02:39:13.850
<v Speaker 4>It's dark.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's dark.</v>

3884
02:39:13.851 --> 02:39:15.710
<v Speaker 4>Like a deer hunter.</v>

<v Speaker 4>we would,</v>

3969
02:42:47.740 --> 02:42:48.573
<v Speaker 4>we reviewed that in the podcast and </v>
<v Speaker 4>apparently I'd say the ducks at three </v>

3970
02:42:50.401 --> 02:42:52.200
<v Speaker 4>foot long Dicks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was wrong.</v>

<v Speaker 4>They have like 13 inch Dick's though.</v>

3973
02:42:59.280 --> 02:43:00.240
<v Speaker 4>Seriously?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3974
02:43:00.241 --> 02:43:01.610
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have giant crazy dicks.</v>

3975
02:43:01.630 --> 02:43:02.221
<v Speaker 4>Dot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look at it.</v>

3976
02:43:02.221 --> 02:43:03.054
<v Speaker 4>That's a duck deck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they come in hot coming in hot </v>

3977
02:43:06.750 --> 02:43:07.583
<v Speaker 4>because the females have been like </v>
<v Speaker 4>program to try to prevent rape and the </v>

3978
02:43:10.801 --> 02:43:12.970
<v Speaker 4>way they've been programmed to try to </v>
<v Speaker 4>prevent rape.</v>

3979
02:43:12.971 --> 02:43:15.970
<v Speaker 4>They develop these like labyrinth </v>
<v Speaker 4>pussies.</v>

3980
02:43:16.000 --> 02:43:17.860
<v Speaker 4>Like look at that in the upper right </v>
<v Speaker 4>hand corner and Jamie,</v>

3981
02:43:17.861 --> 02:43:18.694
<v Speaker 4>there's a female pussy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>female pussy as opposed to what boy </v>

3982
02:43:22.061 --> 02:43:23.380
<v Speaker 4>posted it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what I get in jail.</v>

3983
02:43:23.680 --> 02:43:25.120
<v Speaker 4>That's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's like the,</v>

3984
02:43:25.270 --> 02:43:26.103
<v Speaker 4>the inside of a uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a female duck and they have like these </v>

3985
02:43:29.621 --> 02:43:31.960
<v Speaker 4>little trap doors where the Dick can't </v>
<v Speaker 4>get through.</v>

3986
02:43:32.050 --> 02:43:32.883
<v Speaker 4>So they have to like allow the Dick to </v>
<v Speaker 4>get through and they can actually cut </v>

3987
02:43:36.971 --> 02:43:38.200
<v Speaker 4>off the breeding process.</v>

3988
02:43:38.200 --> 02:43:42.790
<v Speaker 4>They can choose what male society in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>lot of ways to deal with.</v>

3989
02:43:43.190 --> 02:43:44.190
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it does.</v>

3990
02:43:44.310 --> 02:43:45.490
<v Speaker 4>It does.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's super important.</v>

3991
02:43:47.050 --> 02:43:50.140
<v Speaker 4>Loud.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't have a trap door,</v>

3992
02:43:50.141 --> 02:43:52.360
<v Speaker 4>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it might be 10 years,</v>

3993
02:43:52.390 --> 02:43:54.490
<v Speaker 4>but all they do is rape each other and </v>
<v Speaker 4>the duck world,</v>

3994
02:43:54.520 --> 02:43:56.440
<v Speaker 4>they're just biting each other and </v>
<v Speaker 4>raping each other.</v>

3995
02:43:56.441 --> 02:43:59.140
<v Speaker 4>I love hunting ducks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Probably one of my turkeys.</v>

3996
02:44:00.080 --> 02:44:00.791

<v Speaker 4>I shot the first one that ever shot last</v>
<v Speaker 4>year and it was delicious,</v>

4006
02:44:28.300 --> 02:44:29.590

<v Speaker 4>it was a young one.</v>

4007
02:44:29.620 --> 02:44:30.453
<v Speaker 4>It was only a year old and Steve </v>
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] was telling me that a three </v>

4008

<v Speaker 4>them never lived to be three,</v>

4009
02:44:35.950 --> 02:44:39.580
<v Speaker 4>but I was amazed at how big they are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're fucking mungus right.</v>

4012
02:44:45.910 --> 02:44:47.800
<v Speaker 4>which I felt like was the butterball </v>
<v Speaker 4>form.</v>

4013
02:44:47.801 --> 02:44:48.634
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel like this let a bunch of turkeys </v>

4014
02:44:49.091 --> 02:44:51.160
<v Speaker 4>out of trap doors and we just smelled </v>
<v Speaker 4>them now.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>great.</v>

4018
02:44:55.060 --> 02:44:58.210
<v Speaker 4>This is going to be like so easy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They can't do that though.</v>

4019
02:44:58.211 --> 02:45:00.040
<v Speaker 4>Real trees like an establish hunting </v>
<v Speaker 4>brand.</v>

4020
02:45:00.680 --> 02:45:02.440
<v Speaker 4>Everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was fun,</v>

4021
02:45:02.441 --> 02:45:03.274
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

4023
02:45:06.340 --> 02:45:08.290
<v Speaker 4>So good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It tastes so much better.</v>

4024

<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the same thing with wild pigs.</v>

4025
02:45:09.671 --> 02:45:12.040
<v Speaker 4>They taste so much better than </v>
<v Speaker 4>domesticated animals.</v>

4026
02:45:12.280 --> 02:45:15.430
<v Speaker 4>When you domesticate animals to just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you fuck up the whole system,</v>

4027
02:45:16.090 --> 02:45:17.860
<v Speaker 4>but you have to like the game.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you like lamb?</v>

<v Speaker 4>Are you a lamb?</v>

<v Speaker 4>You don't like gave me food.</v>

4031
02:45:24.130 --> 02:45:25.990

<v Speaker 4>Yes it is really lamb.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Huh?</v>

4033
02:45:28.720 --> 02:45:31.050
<v Speaker 4>Maybe you've had a bad,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've had all lines,</v>

4034
02:45:31.060 --> 02:45:33.670
<v Speaker 4>a restaurant over here in woodland hills</v>
<v Speaker 4>called brandywine.</v>

4035
02:45:33.730 --> 02:45:36.190
<v Speaker 4>If you have a rack of lamb from them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Might Change your mind,</v>

4037
02:45:38.410 --> 02:45:39.570
<v Speaker 4>Donald.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All right.</v>

4038
02:45:39.640 --> 02:45:41.500
<v Speaker 4>You've got to go with someone who's </v>
<v Speaker 4>preparing it correctly.</v>

4039
02:45:41.500 --> 02:45:44.200
<v Speaker 4>If you had an a restaurant before I had </v>
<v Speaker 4>it in a restaurant,</v>

4040
02:45:44.201 --> 02:45:47.220
<v Speaker 4>I'd had it at my house everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hmm.</v>

4041
02:45:47.440 --> 02:45:49.300
<v Speaker 4>Not had to domesticate a lamb.</v>
<v Speaker 4>See,</v>

4042
02:45:49.301 --> 02:45:51.220
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what it tastes like to you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the,</v>

4043
02:45:51.290 --> 02:45:53.320

<v Speaker 4>buds.</v>

<v Speaker 4>experiencing.</v>

4046
02:45:57.221 --> 02:45:59.080
<v Speaker 4>I'm just guessing based on my </v>
<v Speaker 4>experience.</v>

4047
02:45:59.570 --> 02:46:04.570
<v Speaker 4>Like I like really hot foods,</v>

<v Speaker 4>killing things just cause you can kill </v>
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>

4113
02:48:36.830 --> 02:48:38.840
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want a human,</v>

4114
02:48:39.770 --> 02:48:40.603
<v Speaker 4>it depends on how good they taste.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You need to find out what do you think </v>

4115
02:48:44.421 --> 02:48:45.254
<v Speaker 4>of healing?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tastes like?</v>

4116
02:48:45.260 --> 02:48:47.540
<v Speaker 4>Probably like pig.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You think that's what they say.</v>

4117
02:48:47.570 --> 02:48:50.030
<v Speaker 4>They call him long.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who's Day people have eaten them.</v>

4118
02:48:50.360 --> 02:48:51.410
<v Speaker 4>Cannibals.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They call him,</v>

4119
02:48:51.440 --> 02:48:53.150
<v Speaker 4>they call him long pigs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They've actually,</v>

4120
02:48:53.300 --> 02:48:54.133
<v Speaker 4>and you think what we eat like am I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>would I be a little sweeter because I'm </v>

4121
02:48:56.061 --> 02:48:58.490
<v Speaker 4>a skittle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Milko kind of probably delicious.</v>

4122
02:48:58.610 --> 02:49:03.610
<v Speaker 4>Marianne.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a beer battered cowboy here.</v>

4123
02:49:05.280 --> 02:49:10.280
<v Speaker 4>Your Hams and tastes like white goop.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You beef those fucking cows.</v>

4124
02:49:12.691 --> 02:49:15.930
<v Speaker 4>They peed beard to in Japan.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4125
02:49:15.931 --> 02:49:17.760
<v Speaker 4>Mandy probably tastes delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>

4126
02:49:17.860 --> 02:49:19.950
<v Speaker 4>I know that like animals,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they eat certain things.</v>

4127
02:49:19.951 --> 02:49:20.910
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's a perfect example.</v>

4128
02:49:20.911 --> 02:49:24.150
<v Speaker 4>Bears of bears eat salmon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like a friend of mine,</v>

4129
02:49:24.170 --> 02:49:26.040
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>made a bear ham out of a bear.</v>

4130
02:49:26.040 --> 02:49:26.873
<v Speaker 4>They called coastal bear and he said it </v>
<v Speaker 4>tasted like you were eating like smoked </v>

4131
02:49:30.241 --> 02:49:32.940
<v Speaker 4>salmon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They smoked a ham from a bear.</v>

4132
02:49:33.060 --> 02:49:35.910
<v Speaker 4>It tasted like smoked salmon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Looks like beef.</v>

4133
02:49:36.080 --> 02:49:38.850
<v Speaker 4>You would have to taste like what you </v>
<v Speaker 4>ate is you're putting it right.</v>

4134
02:49:38.851 --> 02:49:39.870
<v Speaker 4>You'd have to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

4135
02:49:39.990 --> 02:49:40.823
<v Speaker 4>Well that's the other thing is blueberry</v>
<v Speaker 4>bears like bears in the fall that are </v>

4136
02:49:45.090 --> 02:49:45.923
<v Speaker 4>stocking up on blueberries are </v>
<v Speaker 4>apparently one of the most delicious </v>

4137
02:49:48.241 --> 02:49:50.790
<v Speaker 4>things you could eat ever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's supposed to be incredible.</v>

4138
02:49:51.150 --> 02:49:51.983
<v Speaker 4>Like guys like purposely hunt only in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the fall and only over blueberry </v>

4139
02:49:55.711 --> 02:49:56.544
<v Speaker 4>patches.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just cause they want to catch a </v>

4140
02:49:57.271 --> 02:49:59.280
<v Speaker 4>blueberry bear.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You've never had a blueberry bear.</v>

4141
02:49:59.310 --> 02:50:01.230
<v Speaker 4>Never had it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's supposed to be amazing.</v>

4142
02:50:02.000 --> 02:50:04.140
<v Speaker 4>It's supposed to be amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's supposed to be like one of the most</v>

4143
02:50:04.141 --> 02:50:05.790
<v Speaker 4>delicious things you can eat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So yeah,</v>

4144
02:50:05.791 --> 02:50:07.320
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and when you cut them open,</v>

4145
02:50:07.321 --> 02:50:08.490
<v Speaker 4>they smell like blueberries.</v>

4146
02:50:08.640 --> 02:50:09.473
<v Speaker 4>Like they're fat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>smells like blueberries is the fattest </v>

4147
02:50:10.771 --> 02:50:12.240
<v Speaker 4>purple.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like a purple fat.</v>

4148
02:50:12.570 --> 02:50:14.850
<v Speaker 4>This is like a video of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like Steve Rinella.</v>

4149
02:50:14.940 --> 02:50:16.500
<v Speaker 4>How many bears have you killed?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Three.</v>

4150
02:50:18.420 --> 02:50:21.510
<v Speaker 4>Did you like make a cool necklace out of</v>
<v Speaker 4>his cloth or anything?</v>

4151
02:50:21.720 --> 02:50:25.620
<v Speaker 4>I have rugs of rugs I made out of them </v>
<v Speaker 4>head still attached.</v>

4152
02:50:25.920 --> 02:50:27.470
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>heads of time have to write.</v>

4153
02:50:27.490 --> 02:50:28.323
<v Speaker 4>You're going to have a bear rug.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to have the clause in the head </v>

4154
02:50:29.441 --> 02:50:30.274
<v Speaker 4>on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's got to do it.</v>

4155
02:50:30.370 --> 02:50:32.370
<v Speaker 4>Let's go ahead of me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People are weirded out by it.</v>

4156
02:50:32.430 --> 02:50:33.620
<v Speaker 4>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think I'd,</v>

4157
02:50:34.320 --> 02:50:35.153
<v Speaker 4>that'd be a pretty bad ass thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Haven't right in your centerpiece eat m </v>

4158
02:50:38.610 --> 02:50:39.443
<v Speaker 4>and a in where I hunt in Alberta,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have to kill them because they </v>

4159
02:50:42.601 --> 02:50:44.550
<v Speaker 4>don't have no natural predators.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So this is,</v>

4160
02:50:44.551 --> 02:50:45.384
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is Steve Rinella doing it on that </v>

4161
02:50:46.831 --> 02:50:47.040
<v Speaker 4>show.</v>

4162
02:50:47.040 --> 02:50:48.180
<v Speaker 4>Mediator.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But see how the,</v>

4163
02:50:48.181 --> 02:50:50.890
<v Speaker 4>the fat has got like a purple hue to it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4164
02:50:51.210 --> 02:50:52.800
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He takes that stuff and he,</v>

4165
02:50:52.801 --> 02:50:53.634
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>makes lard out of it with that purple </v>

4166
02:50:54.841 --> 02:50:56.070
<v Speaker 4>fat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look at it.</v>

4167
02:50:56.100 --> 02:50:57.670
<v Speaker 4>See how weird it looks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4168
02:50:57.930 --> 02:50:58.500
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>

4169
02:50:58.500 --> 02:51:01.140
<v Speaker 4>that's fat from a bear that's been </v>
<v Speaker 4>eating blueberries.</v>

4170
02:51:01.290 --> 02:51:02.123
<v Speaker 4>See,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we have this fucking jungle book </v>

4171
02:51:03.781 --> 02:51:04.614
<v Speaker 4>view of animals.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So people look at bears like your </v>

4172
02:51:06.511 --> 02:51:07.344
<v Speaker 4>friends,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like your friend bears are all </v>

4173
02:51:09.181 --> 02:51:11.400
<v Speaker 4>cannibals.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All of them are eating cubs,</v>

4174
02:51:11.401 --> 02:51:13.680
<v Speaker 4>especially the ones that we go after,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which are all the males?</v>

4175
02:51:13.740 --> 02:51:16.430
<v Speaker 4>No Kin,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they eat their own cut 100% wow.</v>

4176
02:51:16.470 --> 02:51:17.303
<v Speaker 4>They all do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They'll eat every cub they could get </v>

4177
02:51:18.421 --> 02:51:19.380
<v Speaker 4>ahold of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why not?</v>

4178
02:51:19.381 --> 02:51:21.180
<v Speaker 4>Why wouldn't you just do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

4179
02:51:21.181 --> 02:51:22.014
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think part of that is because they </v>

4180
02:51:24.031 --> 02:51:24.864
<v Speaker 4>don't have a natural predator.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I think nature balances itself out </v>

4181
02:51:27.480 --> 02:51:30.470
<v Speaker 4>and when there's no natural Predator,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think evil out.</v>

4182
02:51:30.540 --> 02:51:31.373
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think what happens is these bears </v>

4183
02:51:32.581 --> 02:51:36.130
<v Speaker 4>become predators against themselves and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

4184
02:51:36.131 --> 02:51:36.964
<v Speaker 4>they eat cubs and they don't want </v>
<v Speaker 4>competition with these young males that </v>

4185
02:51:39.361 --> 02:51:40.194
<v Speaker 4>are coming up and they also want the </v>
<v Speaker 4>female to come back into estrus or they </v>

4186
02:51:42.421 --> 02:51:43.254
<v Speaker 4>could bleed breed again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they just eat cubs and they eat them </v>

4187
02:51:45.421 --> 02:51:46.254
<v Speaker 4>for food.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're finding now that they actually </v>

4188
02:51:47.611 --> 02:51:48.444
<v Speaker 4>go actively hunting for him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like his is a terrible video of </v>

4189
02:51:51.271 --> 02:51:54.890
<v Speaker 4>this polar bear killing this cup that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>the female there next to him.</v>

4190
02:51:54.891 --> 02:51:55.724
<v Speaker 4>Like the females on the right and she's </v>
<v Speaker 4>trying to keep him off and he's killing </v>

4191
02:51:59.551 --> 02:52:02.520
<v Speaker 4>her cub right now and eaten it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so common.</v>

4192
02:52:02.610 --> 02:52:05.510
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's 100% of the males cubs.</v>

4193
02:52:05.550 --> 02:52:06.383
<v Speaker 4>100%</v>

4194
02:52:06.580 --> 02:52:09.400
<v Speaker 3>could you fucking imagine getting mauled</v>
<v Speaker 3>by a polar bear?</v>

4195
02:52:09.580 --> 02:52:10.413
<v Speaker 3>Oh Man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well they're the most fucked up ones </v>

4196
02:52:12.461 --> 02:52:13.294
<v Speaker 3>because they come out of the womb as </v>
<v Speaker 3>predators because they don't eat </v>

4197
02:52:16.391 --> 02:52:17.224
<v Speaker 3>anything but meat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're the only bear that doesn't eat </v>

4198
02:52:19.091 --> 02:52:20.680
<v Speaker 3>grass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't eat anything else.</v>

4199
02:52:20.681 --> 02:52:22.500
<v Speaker 3>Cause they look at their environment </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

4200
02:52:22.510 --> 02:52:23.343
<v Speaker 3>They're there to eat seals and other </v>
<v Speaker 3>bears and the way they keep the </v>

4201
02:52:26.201 --> 02:52:28.150
<v Speaker 3>population down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's by eating each other.</v>

4202
02:52:28.151 --> 02:52:29.950
<v Speaker 3>It's fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>

4203
02:52:29.980 --> 02:52:33.580
<v Speaker 3>that's a simplistic description of it on</v>
<v Speaker 3>the shore biologist we mad at me,</v>

4204
02:52:33.790 --> 02:52:35.530
<v Speaker 3>but there's definitely merit in what I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>saying.</v>

4205
02:52:35.800 --> 02:52:38.440
<v Speaker 3>There's gotta be nature doesn't do that </v>
<v Speaker 3>with a wolves.</v>

4206
02:52:38.441 --> 02:52:40.420
<v Speaker 3>Don't eat each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4207
02:52:40.421 --> 02:52:42.940
<v Speaker 3>tigers don't eat each other and have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>predator.</v>

4208
02:52:42.970 --> 02:52:45.430
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what t Predator Tigers have</v>

4209
02:52:45.431 --> 02:52:49.120
<v Speaker 3>other than people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think maybe tigers have had people</v>

4210
02:52:49.121 --> 02:52:52.600
<v Speaker 3>as a Predator for so long that it kind </v>
<v Speaker 3>of balances itself out.</v>

4211
02:52:53.770 --> 02:52:54.603
<v Speaker 3>But bears man up there by themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Polar bears eat the shit out of each </v>

4212
02:52:58.631 --> 02:53:01.120
<v Speaker 3>other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then a lot of the places where bears</v>

4213
02:53:01.121 --> 02:53:01.954
<v Speaker 3>are like even black bear,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like they're in these dense wooded </v>

4214
02:53:03.851 --> 02:53:04.684
<v Speaker 3>areas where nothing other than grizzlies</v>
<v Speaker 3>can kill a black bear other than black </v>

4215
02:53:08.861 --> 02:53:10.000
<v Speaker 3>bear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they kill each other.</v>

4216
02:53:10.001 --> 02:53:10.834
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

4217
02:53:11.020 --> 02:53:15.040
<v Speaker 3>it's a dark existence man and circle of </v>
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>

4218
02:53:15.130 --> 02:53:15.963
<v Speaker 3>And for hunting populations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the people up there that live in </v>

4219
02:53:17.771 --> 02:53:19.090
<v Speaker 3>Alberta,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they need moose,</v>

4220
02:53:19.360 --> 02:53:20.193
<v Speaker 3>they need deer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like a main staple of these </v>

4221
02:53:21.710 --> 02:53:24.160
<v Speaker 3>people's diet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there's a lot of folks that live up</v>

4222
02:53:24.161 --> 02:53:25.720
<v Speaker 3>there that don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't buy meat,</v>

4223
02:53:26.050 --> 02:53:26.883
<v Speaker 3>so they have to keep those bear </v>
<v Speaker 3>populations in check because they kill </v>

4224
02:53:29.321 --> 02:53:33.370
<v Speaker 3>more than 50% of all the Fonz of all the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Moose calves.</v>

4225
02:53:33.371 --> 02:53:38.371
<v Speaker 3>What the population control in hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you said,</v>

4226
02:53:38.771 --> 02:53:40.900
<v Speaker 3>is it has to be done well.</v>

4227
02:53:40.990 --> 02:53:42.790
<v Speaker 3>It people think it doesn't have to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>done,</v>

4228
02:53:42.791 --> 02:53:45.090
<v Speaker 3>but they don't understand the numbers I </v>
<v Speaker 3>used to be done.</v>

4229
02:53:45.140 --> 02:53:45.973
<v Speaker 3>You look at the populations of people in</v>
<v Speaker 3>this country that die every year from </v>

4230
02:53:48.400 --> 02:53:49.240
<v Speaker 3>accidents.</v>
<v Speaker 3>With deer.</v>

4231
02:53:49.241 --> 02:53:50.074
<v Speaker 3>It's 201.5</v>
<v Speaker 3>million car accidents every year in the </v>

4232
02:53:53.021 --> 02:53:56.590
<v Speaker 3>United States alone with deer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's no other way.</v>

4233
02:53:56.620 --> 02:53:57.453
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's one solution they want to </v>

4234
02:53:58.421 --> 02:54:00.940
<v Speaker 3>reintroduce cougars,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a,</v>

4235
02:54:01.090 --> 02:54:02.440
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that'll work.</v>

4236
02:54:02.441 --> 02:54:04.000
<v Speaker 3>That'll definitely keep the numbers </v>
<v Speaker 3>down,</v>

4237
02:54:04.090 --> 02:54:05.020
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4238
02:54:05.080 --> 02:54:05.913
<v Speaker 3>it's very tricky.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're bringing in an apex Predator and </v>

4239
02:54:08.171 --> 02:54:11.860
<v Speaker 3>hacks Predator and you'll only has an,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a finite supply of food.</v>

4240
02:54:11.980 --> 02:54:14.140
<v Speaker 3>You're going to have to bring in some </v>
<v Speaker 3>people that are going to have to control</v>

4241
02:54:14.141 --> 02:54:16.330
<v Speaker 3>those apex predators.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's what we have in California.</v>

4242
02:54:16.450 --> 02:54:17.283
<v Speaker 3>There's a bunch of people that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>professional mountain lion hunters that </v>

4243
02:54:20.111 --> 02:54:20.944
<v Speaker 3>are employed by the state of California.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when there's a problem mountain </v>

4244
02:54:22.970 --> 02:54:23.803
<v Speaker 3>line,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they go and kill it and it's all hush </v>

4245
02:54:24.371 --> 02:54:24.910
<v Speaker 3>hush.</v>

4246
02:54:24.910 --> 02:54:27.130
<v Speaker 3>Don't talk about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But they kill a hundred of them a year.</v>

4247
02:54:27.370 --> 02:54:28.203
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they're all filled with cats and </v>

4248
02:54:29.231 --> 02:54:31.810
<v Speaker 3>dogs and cats and dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4249
02:54:31.811 --> 02:54:32.820
<v Speaker 3>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4250
02:54:32.890 --> 02:54:34.140
<v Speaker 3>because that's easy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4251
02:54:34.150 --> 02:54:35.230
<v Speaker 3>it's easy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Easy going.</v>

4252
02:54:35.300 --> 02:54:37.780
<v Speaker 3>They got him in the backyard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>caged up watch.</v>

4253
02:54:37.781 --> 02:54:40.960
<v Speaker 3>He's a fucking d right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's got some growing out of his head.</v>

4254
02:54:40.961 --> 02:54:43.330
<v Speaker 3>You might break a leg chasing after and </v>
<v Speaker 3>I can just pray down.</v>

4255
02:54:43.331 --> 02:54:44.164
<v Speaker 3>And this dog on a leash,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stupid fat rottweiler sitting in your </v>

4256
02:54:47.891 --> 02:54:50.080
<v Speaker 3>yard with no balls.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why did you take his balls?</v>

4257
02:54:50.870 --> 02:54:53.080
<v Speaker 3>It's really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it makes it Nicer Jack.</v>

4258
02:54:53.081 --> 02:54:53.914
<v Speaker 3>I'm would carry him over the fence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there are a rag doll that's a a </v>

4259
02:54:57.070 --> 02:54:58.900
<v Speaker 3>pecs predator.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

4260
02:54:59.470 --> 02:55:01.180
<v Speaker 3>I've never seen a mountain lion in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>real and the real world.</v>

4261
02:55:01.181 --> 02:55:03.920
<v Speaker 3>Have they?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How close am I?</v>

4262
02:55:03.921 --> 02:55:04.070

02:55:04.070 --> 02:55:04.903

<v Speaker 1>crawled up the ladder and he was in </v>

<v Speaker 1>Atlanta,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my blankets.</v>

4265
02:55:07.810 --> 02:55:09.450
<v Speaker 8>Ooh.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>

<v Speaker 1>And what are you looking at?</v>

<v Speaker 1>Is he looking at you and not really.</v>

4273
02:55:31.621 --> 02:55:34.380
<v Speaker 1>He was just kind of laid out there and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>

4275
02:55:36.330 --> 02:55:37.710
<v Speaker 1>ran to the house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Oh my goodness.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Even the trees all week long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't move.</v>

4279
02:55:46.561 --> 02:55:49.170
<v Speaker 1>He just sat there and watched us took </v>
<v Speaker 1>over your tree for it.</v>

4280
02:55:49.200 --> 02:55:51.900
<v Speaker 1>He did a little fucker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

4281
02:55:52.370 --> 02:55:53.400

<v Speaker 1>Holy Fuck.</v>

4291
02:56:14.440 --> 02:56:16.830
<v Speaker 1>Maybe 200 yards from the house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4292
02:56:16.831 --> 02:56:19.170
<v Speaker 1>it was just right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And how'd you know when he was gone?</v>

4293
02:56:19.800 --> 02:56:20.633
<v Speaker 1>We went home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know he was gone and we just </v>

4294
02:56:21.871 --> 02:56:23.130
<v Speaker 1>left for the weekend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was it.</v>

4295
02:56:23.131 --> 02:56:24.990
<v Speaker 1>And family vacation was done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

4296
02:56:24.991 --> 02:56:25.651
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4297
02:56:25.651 --> 02:56:27.360
<v Speaker 1>we didn't live there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just go up there and hang out.</v>

4298
02:56:27.390 --> 02:56:32.000
<v Speaker 1>Oh fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God Damn it.</v>

4299
02:56:32.010 --> 02:56:33.780
<v Speaker 1>Fucking wild.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Crazy.</v>

4300
02:56:34.320 --> 02:56:38.010
<v Speaker 1>I seen where I drove by a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>massive bear.</v>

4301
02:56:38.430 --> 02:56:41.160
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>down the four wheelers trail.</v>

4302
02:56:41.161 --> 02:56:43.800
<v Speaker 1>He was standing right there next minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just drove right by and I was like,</v>

4303
02:56:43.830 --> 02:56:44.663
<v Speaker 1>Oh shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I seen a bear chase a kid on a mountain </v>

4304
02:56:47.041 --> 02:56:48.930
<v Speaker 1>bike.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's just in Colorado on Colorado.</v>

4305
02:56:49.110 --> 02:56:51.090
<v Speaker 1>I was on [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4306
02:56:51.100 --> 02:56:52.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Black bears.</v>

4307
02:56:52.380 --> 02:56:54.120
<v Speaker 1>There's only a few brown bears in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Colorado,</v>

4308
02:56:54.121 --> 02:56:55.020
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not that many.</v>

4309
02:56:55.140 --> 02:56:55.973
<v Speaker 1>It was definitely a brock bear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I did see a brown bear chase a </v>

4310
02:56:58.891 --> 02:57:01.170
<v Speaker 1>fucking kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really Chase the kid.</v>

4311
02:57:01.590 --> 02:57:02.423
<v Speaker 1>Was it a color phase?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Black bear might have been a color </v>

4312
02:57:03.751 --> 02:57:04.584
<v Speaker 1>phase.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean he looked Brown and Bill </v>

4313
02:57:05.990 --> 02:57:07.260
<v Speaker 1>Young.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

4314
02:57:07.350 --> 02:57:08.183
<v Speaker 1>He was chasing a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're out riding our dirt bikes and </v>

4315
02:57:09.391 --> 02:57:12.450
<v Speaker 1>there was a little kid on a little 50,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a whole range ahead of us.</v>

4316
02:57:12.720 --> 02:57:13.553
<v Speaker 1>And you've seen the bear fucking hauling</v>
<v Speaker 1>ass down the mountain after the kid on </v>

4317
02:57:17.221 --> 02:57:18.054
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the bike.</v>

4318
02:57:19.290 --> 02:57:21.930
<v Speaker 1>It was insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh fuck that.</v>

4319
02:57:21.931 --> 02:57:22.764
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apparently more black bears kill people </v>

4320
02:57:25.351 --> 02:57:26.184
<v Speaker 1>then brown bears.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apparently black bears are much more </v>

4321
02:57:29.131 --> 02:57:31.710
<v Speaker 1>likely to be predators on people than </v>
<v Speaker 1>brown bears are.</v>

4322
02:57:32.040 --> 02:57:33.810
<v Speaker 1>It's not impossible that a brown bear </v>
<v Speaker 1>would do it,</v>

4323
02:57:33.960 --> 02:57:35.700
<v Speaker 1>but it's more likely that a black pair </v>
<v Speaker 1>would do it.</v>

4324
02:57:36.010 --> 02:57:37.110
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why.</v>

4325
02:57:37.910 --> 02:57:38.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a line just,</v>

4326
02:57:39.210 --> 02:57:40.043
<v Speaker 1>I've never been attacked by anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that and that was a close to your </v>

4327
02:57:41.400 --> 02:57:43.970
<v Speaker 1>bed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but nittany that neither incident graced</v>

4328
02:57:44.000 --> 02:57:44.833
<v Speaker 1>a threat to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rinella was telling me about this one </v>

4329
02:57:46.771 --> 02:57:49.860
<v Speaker 1>dude that he knows who took a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone he knows on a,</v>

4330
02:57:49.890 --> 02:57:50.723
<v Speaker 1>the first hunting trip ever in the tent </v>
<v Speaker 1>gets attacked by a 500 pound predatory </v>

4331
02:57:55.501 --> 02:57:58.170
<v Speaker 1>black bear to attack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some goes in the tent.</v>

4332
02:57:58.200 --> 02:58:00.060
<v Speaker 1>I was trying to eat him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>grabs his head.</v>

4333
02:58:00.300 --> 02:58:01.980
<v Speaker 1>The Dude's comes</v>

4334
02:58:01.980 --> 02:58:05.070
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>shoots some shoots through the bear,</v>

4335
02:58:05.071 --> 02:58:06.960
<v Speaker 4>hits the dude in the wrist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh Shit.</v>

4336
02:58:06.990 --> 02:58:09.630
<v Speaker 4>So the bullet passes through the bear </v>
<v Speaker 4>hits.</v>

4337
02:58:09.631 --> 02:58:12.900
<v Speaker 4>The guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>breaks his arm for the bear runs out and</v>

4338
02:58:12.901 --> 02:58:15.090
<v Speaker 4>then they have to chase the bear down </v>
<v Speaker 4>and runs into another tent.</v>

4339
02:58:15.110 --> 02:58:19.080
<v Speaker 4>I have to shoot the bear first,</v>
<v Speaker 4>first hunting trip ever.</v>

4340
02:58:20.580 --> 02:58:21.413
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Got It.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4342
02:58:22.651 --> 02:58:23.484

<v Speaker 4>what a student had a backpack and had a </v>

4343
02:58:25.410 --> 02:58:26.243

<v Speaker 4>We woke up in the morning on zip to 10 </v>

<v Speaker 4>there was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just took my 45 and just unloaded and </v>

<v Speaker 4>happens in like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

02:58:59.780 --> 02:59:01.400
<v Speaker 4>Just rip you apart.</v>
<v Speaker 4>God,</v>

4357
02:59:01.550 --> 02:59:03.540
<v Speaker 4>could you imagine fucking get in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>tussle with a bear?</v>

4358
02:59:04.110 --> 02:59:06.150
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not equipped for that?</v>

4359
02:59:06.270 --> 02:59:07.530
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

4360
02:59:07.680 --> 02:59:09.300
<v Speaker 4>Do you ever see that video with the </v>
<v Speaker 4>spirit?</v>

4361
02:59:09.301 --> 02:59:11.520
<v Speaker 4>I don't even know if you gave me a </v>
<v Speaker 4>spear.</v>

4362
02:59:11.610 --> 02:59:14.940
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And said in the red core,</v>

4363
02:59:15.810 --> 02:59:17.340
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

4364
02:59:17.790 --> 02:59:20.340
<v Speaker 4>I'd be standing there like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>holy fuck.</v>

4365
02:59:20.400 --> 02:59:21.233
<v Speaker 4>What is this dude doing with his club?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Keep gotten bears pictures on Google </v>

4366
02:59:24.061 --> 02:59:25.890
<v Speaker 4>search.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This was found on Google maps.</v>

4367
02:59:26.040 --> 02:59:26.873
<v Speaker 4>A fat Russian dude just beat the shit </v>
<v Speaker 4>out of that bear with a stick that's </v>

4368
02:59:29.431 --> 02:59:30.264
<v Speaker 4>could beat dad.</v>

4369
02:59:34.460 --> 02:59:35.370
<v Speaker 4>Holy Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4370
02:59:35.371 --> 02:59:36.204
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what I'd do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I you gave me a spear like you're the </v>

4371
02:59:38.821 --> 02:59:41.640
<v Speaker 4>guy who judged by that killed a bear </v>
<v Speaker 4>with a spear is impressive.</v>

4372
02:59:42.030 --> 02:59:42.850
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do you do?</v>

4373
02:59:42.850 --> 02:59:43.683
<v Speaker 4>Have your one shot and you blow it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now that mother fucker's like zoop mad </v>

4374
02:59:47.371 --> 02:59:48.990
<v Speaker 4>at you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mad at calming and hot.</v>

4375
02:59:49.020 --> 02:59:51.300
<v Speaker 4>Did he have a side arm with him?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think he did.</v>

4376
02:59:51.330 --> 02:59:52.163
<v Speaker 4>So my question is if I go spear hunting </v>
<v Speaker 4>with a bear and I unload my spear and </v>

4377
02:59:57.481 --> 03:00:00.150
<v Speaker 4>the bear mauls me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>can I then shoot the bear with a pistol?</v>

4378
03:00:00.180 --> 03:00:01.013
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could definitely shoot the bear to </v>

4379
03:00:01.711 --> 03:00:02.760
<v Speaker 4>stay alive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Stay alive,</v>

4380
03:00:03.480 --> 03:00:06.690
<v Speaker 4>stay alive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Berto has an open weapon policy.</v>

4381
03:00:06.691 --> 03:00:09.360
<v Speaker 4>Like you can use a rifle,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can use a shotgun,</v>

4382
03:00:09.510 --> 03:00:11.700
<v Speaker 4>you can use a crossbow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A spirit is the spirit.</v>

4383
03:00:12.140 --> 03:00:14.610
<v Speaker 4>You're going to outlaw spears.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now because of the outrage.</v>

4384
03:00:14.610 --> 03:00:15.443
<v Speaker 4>Cause everybody's pissed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I think is honestly a good idea </v>

4385
03:00:17.160 --> 03:00:20.460
<v Speaker 4>because most people are not going to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>equipped to do it the way that guy does.</v>

4386
03:00:20.461 --> 03:00:21.294
<v Speaker 4>At the very least.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think if you're going to kill a bear </v>

4387
03:00:22.171 --> 03:00:23.950
<v Speaker 4>with a spirit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have to go through some sort of uh,</v>

4388
03:00:24.220 --> 03:00:26.520
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>spear checking academy.</v>

4389
03:00:26.640 --> 03:00:27.473
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well they should be some sort of a </v>

4390
03:00:29.550 --> 03:00:32.430
<v Speaker 4>certification course where they know </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're competent with the spear,</v>

4391
03:00:32.640 --> 03:00:33.473
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because the spear requires massive </v>

4392
03:00:34.921 --> 03:00:37.410
<v Speaker 4>physical skills.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to be strong as fuck.</v>

4393
03:00:37.620 --> 03:00:40.110
<v Speaker 4>You have to be a person who could throw </v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of weight.</v>

4394
03:00:40.470 --> 03:00:42.180
<v Speaker 4>It's not as easy as like pulling a </v>
<v Speaker 4>trigger.</v>

4395
03:00:42.210 --> 03:00:44.580
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of physicality involved in</v>

4396
03:00:44.581 --> 03:00:45.490
<v Speaker 4>killing someone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Porter,</v>

4397
03:00:45.600 --> 03:00:47.300
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is it gutless think sometimes,</v>

4398
03:00:47.310 --> 03:00:49.050
<v Speaker 4>like you shouldn't just be able to pull </v>
<v Speaker 4>the trigger.</v>

4399
03:00:49.051 --> 03:00:50.970
<v Speaker 4>You should have to passive hunting.</v>

4400
03:00:51.120 --> 03:00:51.953
<v Speaker 4>I think a hunter safety,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're shooting aspects should be a </v>

4401
03:00:54.421 --> 03:00:55.780
<v Speaker 4>little more in depth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh No,</v>

4402
03:00:55.890 --> 03:00:58.500
<v Speaker 4>I don't think you should be able to maim</v>
<v Speaker 4>a fucking animal.</v>

4403
03:00:59.110 --> 03:00:59.880
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

4404
03:00:59.880 --> 03:01:00.713
<v Speaker 4>Like you should,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you should have to put some groupings </v>

4405
03:01:01.781 --> 03:01:04.420
<v Speaker 4>together or something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Handgun or,</v>

4406
03:01:04.421 --> 03:01:07.000
<v Speaker 4>or rifle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know you shouldn't be that go gay.</v>

4407
03:01:07.240 --> 03:01:08.440
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not loaded.</v>

4408
03:01:08.470 --> 03:01:12.100
<v Speaker 4>You fucking know how to put the safety </v>
<v Speaker 4>on and you're 12 go get him.</v>

4409
03:01:12.400 --> 03:01:14.470
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I completely agree because when you pass</v>

4410
03:01:14.471 --> 03:01:15.304
<v Speaker 4>one of those hunter safety courses,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what they are as opposed to 10 I was </v>

4411
03:01:17.720 --> 03:01:20.160
<v Speaker 4>fucking 10 they're easy to pass </v>
<v Speaker 4>questions.</v>

4412
03:01:20.410 --> 03:01:23.800
<v Speaker 4>You just have to know things and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>have to get 60% of the questions right.</v>

4413
03:01:23.830 --> 03:01:24.663
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's it.</v>

4414
03:01:25.030 --> 03:01:27.370
<v Speaker 4>It's just going to get a d a d.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4415
03:01:27.520 --> 03:01:31.570
<v Speaker 4>and then have fun with your dad and his </v>
<v Speaker 4>hunting buddies.</v>

4416
03:01:31.610 --> 03:01:33.070
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't try and burn.</v>

4417
03:01:33.070 --> 03:01:35.920
<v Speaker 4>One of one of them is trying to fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>this this way.</v>

4418
03:01:36.420 --> 03:01:39.970
<v Speaker 4>This is a way to teach people to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>competent first before you allow them to</v>

4419
03:01:39.971 --> 03:01:41.440
<v Speaker 4>do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that's probably the best way,</v>

4420
03:01:41.620 --> 03:01:42.453
<v Speaker 4>but then people hear shit like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you're a fringe and pall mall </v>

4421
03:01:45.251 --> 03:01:47.620
<v Speaker 4>rides.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll teach my son how to do it.</v>

4422
03:01:47.710 --> 03:01:49.390
<v Speaker 4>I hope you do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I hope you hope we do,</v>

4423
03:01:49.391 --> 03:01:50.860
<v Speaker 4>but if we're going to regulate it at </v>
<v Speaker 4>all,</v>

4424
03:01:50.861 --> 03:01:53.800
<v Speaker 4>it seems ridiculous to me that you don't</v>
<v Speaker 4>regulate competency.</v>

4425
03:01:54.160 --> 03:01:54.993
<v Speaker 4>Like people should have a certain amount</v>
<v Speaker 4>of ability before they go hunting or </v>

4426
03:01:57.940 --> 03:02:01.150
<v Speaker 4>before they go and shoot a gun at a </v>
<v Speaker 4>range and he kind of,</v>

4427
03:02:01.210 --> 03:02:02.810
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>bearing arms.</v>

4428
03:02:02.870 --> 03:02:06.030
<v Speaker 4>Imagine if they just gave you a car,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a licenses.</v>

4429
03:02:06.040 --> 03:02:09.360
<v Speaker 4>Do you like asking what's the green </v>
<v Speaker 4>light?</v>

4430
03:02:09.440 --> 03:02:09.791
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

4431
03:02:09.791 --> 03:02:11.600
<v Speaker 4>What do you do when you hit a stop sign </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you,</v>

4432
03:02:11.601 --> 03:02:13.600
<v Speaker 4>you answer these 60% of these questions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4433
03:02:13.650 --> 03:02:15.760
<v Speaker 4>So they give you a car and that's how </v>
<v Speaker 4>you learn.</v>

4434
03:02:15.790 --> 03:02:18.130
<v Speaker 4>You learn by driving out there in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>public,</v>

4435
03:02:18.131 --> 03:02:19.690
<v Speaker 4>but that's kind of what you're doing </v>
<v Speaker 4>with guns.</v>

4436
03:02:20.170 --> 03:02:20.800
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he just,</v>

4437
03:02:20.800 --> 03:02:21.633
<v Speaker 4>someone passes a course and then all of </v>
<v Speaker 4>a sudden they got a gun and they just </v>

4438
03:02:24.191 --> 03:02:25.450
<v Speaker 4>wandering around like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you should,</v>

4439
03:02:25.451 --> 03:02:26.690
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you should know how the fuck man,</v>

4440
03:02:26.760 --> 03:02:28.720
<v Speaker 4>and he's the hunting and then your dad's</v>
<v Speaker 4>bay is like,</v>

4441
03:02:28.721 --> 03:02:30.940
<v Speaker 4>it got them on a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on a four 10.</v>

4442
03:02:30.941 --> 03:02:32.980
<v Speaker 4>Let's give him a 12 gauge.</v>
<v Speaker 4>God dammit.</v>

4443
03:02:33.820 --> 03:02:36.970
<v Speaker 4>Right now you're 10 with a 12 gauge.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4444
03:02:37.930 --> 03:02:40.510
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Having fun or a 300 win mag just fucking</v>

4445
03:02:40.511 --> 03:02:41.360
<v Speaker 4>show,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4446
03:02:41.590 --> 03:02:44.350
<v Speaker 4>a 10 year old with 300 win mag boom </v>
<v Speaker 4>full.</v>

4447
03:02:44.910 --> 03:02:47.200
<v Speaker 4>You just go flying backwards and land on</v>
<v Speaker 4>your ass.</v>

4448
03:02:47.710 --> 03:02:48.461
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

4449
03:02:48.461 --> 03:02:49.720
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

4450
03:02:49.721 --> 03:02:52.180
<v Speaker 4>there's a way to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like meeting in the middle.</v>

4451
03:02:52.340 --> 03:02:53.173
<v Speaker 4>One of the things about like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people who are gun rights advocates is </v>

4452
03:02:55.031 --> 03:02:56.230
<v Speaker 4>they don't want to give up anything.</v>

4453
03:02:56.230 --> 03:02:59.890
<v Speaker 4>And I understand it because they feel </v>
<v Speaker 4>like if you give up any ground,</v>

4454
03:03:01.770 --> 03:03:02.603
<v Speaker 4>they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 4>liberals are going to come in and </v>

4455
03:03:04.871 --> 03:03:05.800
<v Speaker 4>they're gonna want to take all your </v>
<v Speaker 4>guns.</v>

4456
03:03:05.801 --> 03:03:08.080
<v Speaker 4>People who don't have guns don't want </v>
<v Speaker 4>anybody to have guns.</v>

4457
03:03:08.710 --> 03:03:11.260
<v Speaker 4>And people who have guns want everybody </v>
<v Speaker 4>to be able to get a gun.</v>

4458
03:03:12.550 --> 03:03:13.383
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how I'm on the fence on </v>

4459
03:03:15.551 --> 03:03:16.151
<v Speaker 4>Allen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I,</v>

4460
03:03:16.151 --> 03:03:18.130
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I carry a weapon everywhere with me.</v>

4461
03:03:18.430 --> 03:03:19.263
<v Speaker 4>It's what I do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have one in every vehicle all over my </v>

4462
03:03:22.031 --> 03:03:23.560
<v Speaker 4>house.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

4463
03:03:23.561 --> 03:03:25.690
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you and Tim Kennedy should get together.</v>

4464
03:03:25.780 --> 03:03:28.330
<v Speaker 4>We do all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We do all this done,</v>

4465
03:03:29.110 --> 03:03:30.310
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>

4466
03:03:31.420 --> 03:03:32.253
<v Speaker 4>I dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel like I've never had a pull my </v>

4467
03:03:34.181 --> 03:03:36.580
<v Speaker 4>weapon ever,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I feel like if I did,</v>

4468
03:03:36.581 --> 03:03:39.130
<v Speaker 4>I would kill somebody for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If it pushed me to that point.</v>

4469
03:03:39.250 --> 03:03:41.890
<v Speaker 4>If you were in a position where </v>
<v Speaker 4>someone's going to take your life,</v>

4470
03:03:41.920 --> 03:03:42.753
<v Speaker 4>which happens all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it would be wonderful if you could talk </v>

4471
03:03:44.891 --> 03:03:46.390
<v Speaker 4>someone out of that without having to </v>
<v Speaker 4>shoot them.</v>

4472
03:03:46.870 --> 03:03:47.703
<v Speaker 4>But there's a lot of people that don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>want to believe if the scenario does </v>

4473
03:03:50.291 --> 03:03:52.240
<v Speaker 4>present itself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>occasionally we got to shoot somebody.</v>

4474
03:03:52.330 --> 03:03:53.560
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4475
03:03:54.040 --> 03:03:56.080
<v Speaker 4>it does.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It does happens all the time.</v>

4476
03:03:56.430 --> 03:03:57.263
<v Speaker 4>He can't control,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a giant fucking population on </v>

4477
03:04:00.171 --> 03:04:01.004
<v Speaker 4>this planet and amongst those people you</v>
<v Speaker 4>are going to run into the wrong </v>

4478
03:04:03.621 --> 03:04:07.370
<v Speaker 4>motherfucker sometimes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether it's some Ted Bundy character or</v>

4479
03:04:07.371 --> 03:04:10.610
<v Speaker 4>there at some fucking school shooter or </v>
<v Speaker 4>there who knows.</v>

4480
03:04:10.790 --> 03:04:11.623
<v Speaker 4>You just don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And this idea that you shouldn't be </v>

4481
03:04:13.341 --> 03:04:15.620
<v Speaker 4>prepared and then we should pretend that</v>
<v Speaker 4>those people don't exist.</v>

4482
03:04:16.040 --> 03:04:21.040
<v Speaker 4>That's desk just as unhealthy as a </v>
<v Speaker 4>someone thinking that everyone should be</v>

4483
03:04:21.561 --> 03:04:22.394
<v Speaker 4>armed everywhere they go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We should all have guns laying on the </v>

4484
03:04:23.691 --> 03:04:26.120
<v Speaker 4>table and that's just as unhealthy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's all,</v>

4485
03:04:26.150 --> 03:04:27.110
<v Speaker 4>it's all of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's crazy.</v>

4486
03:04:27.530 --> 03:04:28.363
<v Speaker 4>Like there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of people here and we </v>

4487
03:04:30.861 --> 03:04:33.140
<v Speaker 4>definitely need to work on being nicer </v>
<v Speaker 4>to each other.</v>

4488
03:04:34.700 --> 03:04:37.580
<v Speaker 4>Be Nice to her.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And maybe an Abra talked about this.</v>

4489
03:04:37.581 --> 03:04:40.430
<v Speaker 4>I think mutual combat should be a thing </v>
<v Speaker 4>that has allowed,</v>

4490
03:04:40.670 --> 03:04:42.640
<v Speaker 4>that's in Seattle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't get to watch this game.</v>

4491
03:04:42.650 --> 03:04:45.020
<v Speaker 4>Road rage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I puts me over the edge,</v>

4492
03:04:45.430 --> 03:04:47.570
<v Speaker 4>motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I will lose my mind.</v>

4493
03:04:47.571 --> 03:04:49.610
<v Speaker 4>Do you know why that is?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why that is?</v>

4494
03:04:49.611 --> 03:04:51.080
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I road rage exists.</v>

4495
03:04:51.230 --> 03:04:52.063
<v Speaker 4>They've actually done like they've made </v>
<v Speaker 4>a scientific explanation that actually </v>

4496
03:04:54.471 --> 03:04:56.600
<v Speaker 4>makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you're driving in a car,</v>

4497
03:04:56.660 --> 03:04:58.610
<v Speaker 4>things are happening in Split seconds,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4498
03:04:58.611 --> 03:05:00.620
<v Speaker 4>So you're in that car,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people changing lanes,</v>

4499
03:05:00.621 --> 03:05:03.110
<v Speaker 4>you're moving 60 miles an hour,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I mean,</v>

4500
03:05:03.111 --> 03:05:04.940
<v Speaker 4>how many feet a second is that you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>flying by,</v>

4501
03:05:04.941 --> 03:05:07.880
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it requires you to be tuned in.</v>

4502
03:05:08.030 --> 03:05:10.910
<v Speaker 4>Two senses are very tuned in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And because of that,</v>

4503
03:05:10.911 --> 03:05:13.520
<v Speaker 4>anytime something happens,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're on red alert.</v>

4504
03:05:13.730 --> 03:05:16.570
<v Speaker 4>So you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or you're engaging with people on red,</v>

4505
03:05:16.571 --> 03:05:17.404
<v Speaker 4>Oh fuck you.</v>

4506
03:05:17.480 --> 03:05:20.600
<v Speaker 4>Like you're in that car and you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're already so ramped up.</v>

4507
03:05:20.690 --> 03:05:22.640
<v Speaker 4>By the time you get out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're like ready to go to war.</v>

4508
03:05:22.760 --> 03:05:26.300
<v Speaker 4>And people that are like normally calm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they get in those situations and they're</v>

4509
03:05:26.310 --> 03:05:28.490
<v Speaker 4>so fucking ramped up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So ramped up.</v>

4510
03:05:28.520 --> 03:05:29.630
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what it is.</v>

4511
03:05:29.990 --> 03:05:31.860
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's dealing with bullshit.</v>

4512
03:05:31.910 --> 03:05:33.300
<v Speaker 4>Allow it to be done.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It,</v>

03:07:34.740 --> 03:07:35.371
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

4567
03:07:35.371 --> 03:07:36.630
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's dressed like a superhero,</v>

4568
03:07:36.631 --> 03:07:38.580
<v Speaker 4>which is even more humiliating.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They kicked your ass.</v>

4569
03:07:38.850 --> 03:07:39.683
<v Speaker 4>So they start going at it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're standing there in front of the </v>

4570
03:07:41.551 --> 03:07:42.384
<v Speaker 4>cops.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look at this.</v>

4571
03:07:42.720 --> 03:07:43.950
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

4572
03:07:44.010 --> 03:07:46.860
<v Speaker 4>Oh leg kick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then he's bouncing,</v>

4573
03:07:46.861 --> 03:07:48.270
<v Speaker 4>moving on him and do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was like,</v>

4574
03:07:48.271 --> 03:07:49.890
<v Speaker 4>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what wac leg kick again.</v>

4575
03:07:49.920 --> 03:07:54.920
<v Speaker 4>Oh Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got back and he's bounced it around on</v>

4576
03:07:55.861 --> 03:07:57.600
<v Speaker 4>him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's throwing jabs to the body.</v>

4577
03:07:57.630 --> 03:08:00.360
<v Speaker 4>And is that the cop right there to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>right and watching?</v>

4578
03:08:00.390 --> 03:08:00.931
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>

4579
03:08:00.931 --> 03:08:02.340
<v Speaker 4>Because if it goes to the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's over.</v>

4580
03:08:02.400 --> 03:08:03.211
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

4581
03:08:03.211 --> 03:08:06.420
<v Speaker 4>I think in case the guy quits,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess if the guy quits,</v>

4582
03:08:06.421 --> 03:08:10.170
<v Speaker 4>the cop has to be there to say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well then it's a salt.</v>

4583
03:08:10.170 --> 03:08:12.240
<v Speaker 4>After that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's no longer mutual combat.</v>

4584
03:08:12.330 --> 03:08:16.050
<v Speaker 4>Like he's just kicking the shit out of </v>
<v Speaker 4>his leg when we do,</v>

4585
03:08:16.051 --> 03:08:17.970
<v Speaker 4>it's moving forward just in a Zombie </v>
<v Speaker 4>state.</v>

4586
03:08:17.971 --> 03:08:18.804
<v Speaker 4>Now he doesn't know what the fuck's </v>
<v Speaker 4>going on and then the beating come down </v>

4587
03:08:20.701 --> 03:08:22.230
<v Speaker 4>and then the cop step in and separate </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

4588
03:08:22.270 --> 03:08:23.011
<v Speaker 4>I say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

4589
03:08:23.011 --> 03:08:24.110
<v Speaker 4>that's enough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a,</v>

4590
03:08:24.120 --> 03:08:25.830
<v Speaker 4>then they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>have a good night.</v>

4591
03:08:25.860 --> 03:08:26.461
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Exactly no paperwork because doing it in</v>

4594
03:08:29.431 --> 03:08:30.264
<v Speaker 4>front of the cops,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Washington state as some crazy mutual </v>

03:08:33.631 --> 03:08:34.464
<v Speaker 4>combat law,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how do we get that pass across the </v>

4596
03:08:35.941 --> 03:08:38.940
<v Speaker 4>board?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It would stop a lot of fucking Jabber,</v>

4597
03:08:38.941 --> 03:08:40.200
<v Speaker 4>John.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God,</v>

<v Speaker 4>It's not a people that say things they </v>

4600
03:08:44.731 --> 03:08:46.470
<v Speaker 4>don't really mean.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

4601
03:08:46.471 --> 03:08:48.780
<v Speaker 4>and they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they open up possibilities.</v>

4602
03:08:48.781 --> 03:08:51.510
<v Speaker 4>They don't really want to take place </v>
<v Speaker 4>because alcohol,</v>

4603
03:08:51.720 --> 03:08:53.010
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Jump.</v>

4605

<v Speaker 4>Well that's why pots better,</v>

4606
03:08:57.870 --> 03:08:58.703

<v Speaker 4>he actually jumped and he didn't even </v>

4607
03:09:00.781 --> 03:09:01.614
<v Speaker 4>know how to jump,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is the most ridiculous thing in </v>

4608
03:09:03.271 --> 03:09:04.104
<v Speaker 4>front of a cop on camera.</v>
<v Speaker 4>At least you could take an ass whipping </v>

4609
03:09:07.410 --> 03:09:09.330
<v Speaker 4>description of what happened here is </v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of interesting.</v>

4610
03:09:09.470 --> 03:09:11.230
<v Speaker 4>Who wrote this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just somebody somewhere.</v>

4611
03:09:11.270 --> 03:09:12.540
<v Speaker 4>I think it's whoever shot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

4612
03:09:12.541 --> 03:09:16.770
<v Speaker 4>he said F u n word and he was going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>walk away and leave and the guy said,</v>

<v Speaker 4>I'll fight you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

4614
03:09:17.380 --> 03:09:18.213
<v Speaker 4>I'll take it to your house.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then that's when he went to the </v>

4615
03:09:19.471 --> 03:09:20.130
<v Speaker 4>Commons.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All right,</v>

4616
03:09:20.130 --> 03:09:21.840
<v Speaker 4>we're going to fight them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>At this point,</v>

4617
03:09:21.841 --> 03:09:25.920
<v Speaker 4>Phoenix agrees to mutual combat the to </v>
<v Speaker 4>shake hands and the fight commences.</v>

4618
03:09:30.090 --> 03:09:31.800
<v Speaker 4>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck you,</v>

03:09:31.980 --> 03:09:33.960
<v Speaker 4>I'll bring this to your house.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4620
03:09:33.990 --> 03:09:35.700

<v Speaker 4>of the dude,</v>

4621
03:09:35.701 --> 03:09:36.570
<v Speaker 4>the dude says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4622
03:09:36.571 --> 03:09:38.100
<v Speaker 4>you don't want it up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>None of this.</v>

4623
03:09:42.360 --> 03:09:43.770
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's hilarious.</v>

4624
03:09:44.100 --> 03:09:45.030
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Combat.</v>

4625
03:09:45.660 --> 03:09:46.493
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well that can only exist in like them </v>

4626
03:09:48.541 --> 03:09:51.450
<v Speaker 4>wild west dates.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you get that off in Arizona,</v>

4627
03:09:51.480 --> 03:09:54.520
<v Speaker 4>maybe New Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They could pull that off.</v>

4628
03:09:54.820 --> 03:09:55.990
<v Speaker 4>Tell him I'll never make it to </v>
<v Speaker 4>California,</v>

4629
03:09:56.220 --> 03:09:56.920
<v Speaker 4>California.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Me.</v>

4630
03:09:56.920 --> 03:10:01.160
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] they'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we have to stop violence and guns.</v>

4631
03:10:01.170 --> 03:10:03.310
<v Speaker 4>You have any reasonable sides?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is it both sides?</v>

4632
03:10:03.340 --> 03:10:04.173
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We have like a lot of people that came </v>

4633
03:10:05.261 --> 03:10:10.180
<v Speaker 4>over here to grow sprouts and I don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>think there's going to be much,</v>

4634
03:10:10.510 --> 03:10:13.210
<v Speaker 4>much mutual down in Compton.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

4635
03:10:13.810 --> 03:10:14.650
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

4636
03:10:14.651 --> 03:10:17.350
<v Speaker 4>The yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have to learn how to fight first.</v>

4637
03:10:17.620 --> 03:10:19.330
<v Speaker 4>If you don't know how to fight,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's when the guns come out.</v>

4638
03:10:20.730 --> 03:10:23.980
<v Speaker 4>It's really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wonder if mutual combat allows weapons</v>

4639
03:10:23.981 --> 03:10:26.320
<v Speaker 4>if you both have weapons.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

4640
03:10:26.321 --> 03:10:28.390
<v Speaker 4>I think that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's not in the rules.</v>

4641
03:10:28.450 --> 03:10:29.950
<v Speaker 4>It's murder you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have you seen that shit?</v>

<v Speaker 4>face,</v>

4651

<v Speaker 4>look at this.</v>

4662
03:11:14.590 --> 03:11:17.140
<v Speaker 4>but they're big in the legs.</v>

<v Speaker 4>happen.</v>

4671
03:11:33.070 --> 03:11:34.510
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess they stopped it.</v>

03:11:34.540 --> 03:11:36.160
<v Speaker 4>He did on his own.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was like,</v>

4676
03:11:40.360 --> 03:11:42.070

<v Speaker 4>He's done.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4681

<v Speaker 4>the blade,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that dude's throat,</v>

03:13:10.050 --> 03:13:10.883
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know allowed to do that jump kick </v>

4713
03:13:12.260 --> 03:13:13.550
<v Speaker 4>and then put it to his throat.</v>

4714
03:13:13.790 --> 03:13:15.080
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't do that.</v>

4715
03:13:15.110 --> 03:13:15.531
<v Speaker 4>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>

4716
03:13:15.531 --> 03:13:19.640
<v Speaker 4>you can seriously cut his head off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The referee stopped too violent.</v>

4717
03:13:20.090 --> 03:13:20.923
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the guy who long before two dudes </v>

4718
03:13:22.520 --> 03:13:26.620
<v Speaker 4>dress up and Samurai outfits with no </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking armor and go at it.</v>

4719
03:13:27.550 --> 03:13:28.383
<v Speaker 4>How?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How can you take an ax to the head six </v>

4720
03:13:30.021 --> 03:13:31.340
<v Speaker 4>times?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't.</v>

4721
03:13:31.370 --> 03:13:34.220
<v Speaker 4>Obviously one guy went down like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

4722
03:13:34.221 --> 03:13:35.870
<v Speaker 4>but I mean how can is that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no blood.</v>

4723
03:13:35.900 --> 03:13:38.560
<v Speaker 4>Look at the cause of his helmet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want the mace look.</v>

4724
03:13:38.970 --> 03:13:41.890
<v Speaker 4>This is so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fighting for points to and says,</v>

4725
03:13:42.550 --> 03:13:44.510
<v Speaker 4>God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't stab.</v>

4726
03:13:44.511 --> 03:13:47.510
<v Speaker 4>I haven't seen any stabbing going on </v>
<v Speaker 4>because I feel like that'd be my move.</v>

4727
03:13:47.540 --> 03:13:48.373
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's what's unrealistic about it in </v>

4728
03:13:49.311 --> 03:13:52.520
<v Speaker 4>the real world and if the two on one </v>
<v Speaker 4>like this,</v>

4729
03:13:52.521 --> 03:13:54.320
<v Speaker 4>they would be stabbing each other for </v>
<v Speaker 4>sure.</v>

4730
03:13:54.321 --> 03:13:55.460
<v Speaker 4>His fights,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it'd be quicker.</v>

4731
03:13:55.670 --> 03:13:56.503
<v Speaker 4>So like there's something about like </v>
<v Speaker 4>using these blunt objects and not being </v>

4732
03:13:59.901 --> 03:14:00.830
<v Speaker 4>able to stab each other.</v>

4733
03:14:00.950 --> 03:14:03.260
<v Speaker 4>That makes it almost more ridiculously </v>
<v Speaker 4>brutal.</v>

4734
03:14:04.250 --> 03:14:07.610
<v Speaker 4>This is a crazy fuck how big that is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the mountain.</v>

4735
03:14:08.540 --> 03:14:11.090
<v Speaker 4>This is awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They tackle each other,</v>

4736
03:14:11.600 --> 03:14:13.130
<v Speaker 4>I think when you're down,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're down.</v>

4737
03:14:13.160 --> 03:14:14.480
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He seems confident.</v>

4738
03:14:14.510 --> 03:14:16.460
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't be confident if I was in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>war.</v>

4739
03:14:16.461 --> 03:14:18.230
<v Speaker 4>I'd be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that guy was to stab me in the Dick.</v>

4740
03:14:18.530 --> 03:14:21.800
<v Speaker 4>I got to get up now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How crazy would warby,</v>

4741
03:14:21.810 --> 03:14:26.690
<v Speaker 4>how fucking crazy would old time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>warby old time barbarian style sword,</v>

<v Speaker 4>macy's.</v>

4743
03:14:28.390 --> 03:14:29.740
<v Speaker 4>Like if you're the guy and you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>choosing,</v>

4744
03:14:29.760 --> 03:14:31.810
<v Speaker 4>what would you be your weapon?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I'm like,</v>

4745
03:14:32.430 --> 03:14:33.263
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for sure.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4748
03:14:36.590 --> 03:14:37.880

4753
03:14:51.410 --> 03:14:52.430
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe.</v>

4754
03:14:52.610 --> 03:14:53.443
<v Speaker 4>Especially if your guy doesn't train and</v>
<v Speaker 4>they weren't really trained in that </v>

4755
03:14:55.580 --> 03:14:56.413
<v Speaker 4>month and then you're fatigued and dying</v>
<v Speaker 4>and some dude's cutting your head off </v>

<v Speaker 4>and you get to see that sword right when</v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

4757
03:15:01.800 --> 03:15:04.340
<v Speaker 4>when it hits your neck,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but a man went to the actual life.</v>

<v Speaker 4>May as in comparison to boxing and how </v>

4773
03:15:54.091 --> 03:15:54.924
<v Speaker 4>people have embraced it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is like if they've figured out a </v>

4774
03:15:58.561 --> 03:16:01.620
<v Speaker 4>way to regrow limbs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if they figured out a way,</v>

4775
03:16:01.621 --> 03:16:03.870
<v Speaker 4>like we're 100% if you get your arm cut </v>
<v Speaker 4>off,</v>

4776
03:16:04.050 --> 03:16:07.260

<v Speaker 4>People are doing this,</v>

4777

<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't regrow your heart back or your</v>

4778
03:16:10.351 --> 03:16:11.184
<v Speaker 4>head.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's true.</v>

4779
03:16:11.190 --> 03:16:12.330
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't stab in the heart.</v>

4780
03:16:12.450 --> 03:16:13.850
<v Speaker 4>Can't cut their head off,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you can come down.</v>

4781
03:16:14.370 --> 03:16:16.680
<v Speaker 4>That'd be like a three point stance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes or no.</v>

4782
03:16:16.800 --> 03:16:18.840
<v Speaker 4>No kicks in the Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That'd be,</v>

4783
03:16:18.841 --> 03:16:19.720
<v Speaker 4>you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

<v Speaker 4>that would be the rules.</v>

4786
03:16:24.300 --> 03:16:25.133
<v Speaker 4>But you can cut a guy's arm off and they</v>
<v Speaker 4>immediately seal it up real quick and </v>

4787
03:16:27.391 --> 03:16:28.530
<v Speaker 4>they rushed him to the hospital.</v>

<v Speaker 4>you still fight?</v>

4789
03:16:32.671 --> 03:16:33.504

4796
03:16:47.000 --> 03:16:50.330
<v Speaker 4>You can come back to big or,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

4797
03:16:50.560 --> 03:16:52.050
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's like a sprout.</v>

4798
03:16:52.080 --> 03:16:53.820
<v Speaker 4>It's how it has some salad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It has them girl,</v>

4799
03:16:54.060 --> 03:16:56.820
<v Speaker 4>and then it has to stretch out and grow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4800
03:16:56.850 --> 03:17:00.330
<v Speaker 4>That's what I would think along the way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like all alligator arm,</v>

4801
03:17:00.690 --> 03:17:02.310
<v Speaker 4>like an alligator doesn't just grow a </v>
<v Speaker 4>goal.</v>

4802
03:17:02.340 --> 03:17:06.200
<v Speaker 4>The whole thing just just pop out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They start slowly.</v>

4803
03:17:06.210 --> 03:17:06.970
<v Speaker 4>They regrow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's,</v>

4804
03:17:06.970 --> 03:17:07.720
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were grow.</v>

4805
03:17:07.720 --> 03:17:08.553
<v Speaker 4>There's no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she,</v>

4806
03:17:08.560 --> 03:17:11.040
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know that Gary asked fuckers </v>
<v Speaker 4>gainers.</v>

4807
03:17:11.160 --> 03:17:14.250
<v Speaker 4>There's a scary lizards regrow their </v>
<v Speaker 4>legs.</v>

4808
03:17:14.370 --> 03:17:15.870
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got a little gators.</v>

4809
03:17:15.871 --> 03:17:16.800
<v Speaker 4>I call it those.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My friends,</v>

4810
03:17:16.801 --> 03:17:17.634
<v Speaker 4>they call them gators.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hang out on the boat and eat all the </v>

4811
03:17:19.651 --> 03:17:21.150
<v Speaker 4>food,</v>
<v Speaker 4>drink all the alcohol,</v>

4812
03:17:21.151 --> 03:17:23.220
<v Speaker 4>and it comes when it comes time to fill </v>
<v Speaker 4>out bitch up,</v>

4813
03:17:23.250 --> 03:17:24.870
<v Speaker 4>there's little arms.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Can't reach their wallets.</v>

4814
03:17:25.020 --> 03:17:25.850
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those kinds of,</v>

4815
03:17:25.850 --> 03:17:27.480
<v Speaker 4>that's like t rex arms,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the gators.</v>

4816
03:17:27.510 --> 03:17:29.910
<v Speaker 4>But you can't make shoes out of them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I was cool.</v>

4817
03:17:30.320 --> 03:17:33.180
<v Speaker 4>That was cool at all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The gators day gators.</v>

4818
03:17:33.181 --> 03:17:34.830
<v Speaker 4>When I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I used to live in Florida.</v>

4819
03:17:34.831 --> 03:17:37.850
<v Speaker 4>We lived near a lake.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Alice in Gainesville and uh,</v>

4820
03:17:37.950 --> 03:17:39.720
<v Speaker 4>alligators were endangered when I was a </v>
<v Speaker 4>kid.</v>

4821
03:17:40.590 --> 03:17:41.423
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like they were telling people not to </v>

4822
03:17:42.241 --> 03:17:44.940
<v Speaker 4>feed them because people throw </v>
<v Speaker 4>marshmallows and the water.</v>

4823
03:17:45.000 --> 03:17:46.860
<v Speaker 4>Why did you like marshmallows so much?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

4824
03:17:46.920 --> 03:17:47.753
<v Speaker 4>They love him though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the gators would eat the </v>

4825
03:17:48.721 --> 03:17:49.860
<v Speaker 4>marshmallow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it was cool to do.</v>

4826
03:17:49.860 --> 03:17:50.693
<v Speaker 4>We would get marshmallows and throw them</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the water and then they started </v>

4827
03:17:51.901 --> 03:17:52.734
<v Speaker 4>telling you can't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't digest them well like these </v>

4828
03:17:54.781 --> 03:17:56.190
<v Speaker 4>are in danger.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We have to take care of them.</v>

4829
03:17:56.370 --> 03:17:57.203
<v Speaker 4>And then from then on they just slowly </v>
<v Speaker 4>but surely overwhelmed to the point </v>

4830
03:18:01.321 --> 03:18:01.891
<v Speaker 4>where like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

4831
03:18:01.891 --> 03:18:04.680
<v Speaker 4>you can hunt them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>can shoot 500 of them a year.</v>

4832
03:18:04.950 --> 03:18:09.950
<v Speaker 4>Like they have tags were 500 alligators </v>
<v Speaker 4>can get killed by one dude.</v>

4833
03:18:10.560 --> 03:18:13.020
<v Speaker 4>500 500 that's some serious hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4834
03:18:13.021 --> 03:18:14.670
<v Speaker 4>That's some serious one and a half a </v>
<v Speaker 4>day.</v>

4835
03:18:14.690 --> 03:18:16.080
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Every day.</v>

4836
03:18:16.170 --> 03:18:17.280
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they only have a season,</v>

4837
03:18:17.310 --> 03:18:18.840
<v Speaker 4>so they're doing way more than one a </v>
<v Speaker 4>day,</v>

4838
03:18:19.080 --> 03:18:21.480
<v Speaker 4>but they do an all bunch of different </v>
<v Speaker 4>ways of doing lines.</v>

4839
03:18:21.600 --> 03:18:24.900
<v Speaker 4>They put they date,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they swallow a hook.</v>

4840
03:18:24.901 --> 03:18:26.190
<v Speaker 4>Is that what's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then they're just,</v>

4841
03:18:26.340 --> 03:18:27.720
<v Speaker 4>and the thrash around you shoot him in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the head.</v>

4842
03:18:27.750 --> 03:18:28.430
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they're,</v>

4843
03:18:28.430 --> 03:18:30.750
<v Speaker 4>they're essentially on a hook in their </v>
<v Speaker 4>belly.</v>

4844
03:18:30.780 --> 03:18:32.700
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You ever see swamp people?</v>

4845
03:18:32.730 --> 03:18:33.563
<v Speaker 4>I do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I just didn't ever grasp like the </v>

4846
03:18:34.621 --> 03:18:36.270
<v Speaker 4>hook him in the mouth or it's in their </v>
<v Speaker 4>gut.</v>

4847
03:18:36.330 --> 03:18:38.790
<v Speaker 4>It's sometimes to the mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like fishing sometimes.</v>

4848
03:18:38.850 --> 03:18:42.240
<v Speaker 4>I mean if you have a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a line for a catfish,</v>

4849
03:18:42.480 --> 03:18:43.313
<v Speaker 4>you lay out a line.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like a lot of times you'll catch them </v>

4850
03:18:45.001 --> 03:18:47.440
<v Speaker 4>though they're barely hooked.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes you catch and it's hooked.</v>

4851
03:18:47.441 --> 03:18:48.730
<v Speaker 4>They're hooked deep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they,</v>

4852
03:18:48.731 --> 03:18:49.564
<v Speaker 4>that's the same thing they do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then they pull them in and they </v>

4853
03:18:51.281 --> 03:18:53.350
<v Speaker 4>shoot them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they can shoot 500 of this.</v>

4854
03:18:53.351 --> 03:18:55.810
<v Speaker 4>I was watching that swamp people show </v>
<v Speaker 4>and they were,</v>

4855
03:18:55.811 --> 03:18:59.380
<v Speaker 4>the guy had a tag limit of 500 </v>
<v Speaker 4>alligators.</v>

4856
03:18:59.410 --> 03:19:01.930
<v Speaker 4>What is a a gator pay?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a good question.</v>

4857
03:19:02.220 --> 03:19:03.053
<v Speaker 4>And what do they do with the gator </v>
<v Speaker 4>besides make bitching ass boots for me </v>

4858
03:19:05.020 --> 03:19:06.430
<v Speaker 4>then make bitch ass boots for you.</v>

4859
03:19:06.760 --> 03:19:08.650
<v Speaker 4>They make a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean to eat gator belt.</v>

4860
03:19:08.651 --> 03:19:09.484
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Apparently it's the highest in protein </v>

4861
03:19:12.250 --> 03:19:13.083
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] Papa dose.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then you can get an appetizer </v>

4862
03:19:16.510 --> 03:19:18.940
<v Speaker 4>alligator,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you're getting some frozen bullshit,</v>

4863
03:19:18.970 --> 03:19:21.680
<v Speaker 4>which you really want to do apparently </v>
<v Speaker 4>according to all the New Mexico,</v>

4864
03:19:21.690 --> 03:19:22.523
<v Speaker 4>I think it's fresh alligator.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But my friend John Dudley is the </v>

4865
03:19:25.170 --> 03:19:26.003
<v Speaker 4>alligator hunter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He hunts alligators occasionally and he </v>

4866
03:19:27.701 --> 03:19:30.220
<v Speaker 4>shoots with a bow and Arrow and he says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4867
03:19:30.250 --> 03:19:32.250
<v Speaker 4>that they're delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you get the,</v>

4868
03:19:32.251 --> 03:19:35.080
<v Speaker 4>the gator tail like right after the or </v>
<v Speaker 4>dies,</v>

4869
03:19:35.110 --> 03:19:36.730
<v Speaker 4>it's delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's super lean.</v>

4870
03:19:36.880 --> 03:19:37.713
<v Speaker 4>You don't Cook it very long.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like one of those things that you </v>

4871
03:19:39.131 --> 03:19:40.050
<v Speaker 4>cook it like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4872
03:19:40.110 --> 03:19:41.350
<v Speaker 4>like you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4873
03:19:41.650 --> 03:19:43.930
<v Speaker 4>I guess you'd have to cook pork.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

4874
03:19:43.931 --> 03:19:46.270
<v Speaker 4>I wonder if they get tricker gnosis like</v>
<v Speaker 4>a pig does.</v>

4875
03:19:46.510 --> 03:19:49.570
<v Speaker 4>That's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure they live in a nasty swamp.</v>

4876
03:19:49.720 --> 03:19:51.580
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I wonder if they're like susceptible</v>

4877
03:19:51.581 --> 03:19:53.140
<v Speaker 4>to it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cause like when they eat it,</v>

4878
03:19:53.141 --> 03:19:53.974
<v Speaker 4>I wonder if their body breaks it down in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the same way our body does or a pig's </v>

4879
03:19:56.051 --> 03:19:59.620
<v Speaker 4>body does or a or a bear or even a </v>
<v Speaker 4>mountain lion.</v>

4880
03:19:59.800 --> 03:20:01.750
<v Speaker 4>That's where all the cases a trick and </v>
<v Speaker 4>osis come from.</v>

4881
03:20:02.590 --> 03:20:04.120
<v Speaker 4>But when they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4882
03:20:04.150 --> 03:20:05.830
<v Speaker 4>they do that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>apparently it's delicious.</v>

4883
03:20:05.860 --> 03:20:08.130
<v Speaker 4>We take a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>an alligator freshly killed alligator.</v>

4884
03:20:08.131 --> 03:20:11.920
<v Speaker 4>It's supposed to be real and super high </v>
<v Speaker 4>protein higher than even like Moose.</v>

4885
03:20:12.330 --> 03:20:14.470
<v Speaker 4>Really higher than Bison.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Higher than anything.</v>

4886
03:20:16.580 --> 03:20:19.360
<v Speaker 4>Supposed to be good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>500 a tag.</v>

4887
03:20:19.480 --> 03:20:21.640
<v Speaker 4>And how many tags are given out?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

4888
03:20:21.641 --> 03:20:23.410
<v Speaker 4>It's a good question,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I to get rid of them.</v>

4889
03:20:23.440 --> 03:20:25.900
<v Speaker 4>It's their 10 guys with 500 a piece or </v>
<v Speaker 4>is there,</v>

4890
03:20:25.990 --> 03:20:26.740
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's the,</v>

4891
03:20:26.740 --> 03:20:28.120
<v Speaker 4>it's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

4892
03:20:28.150 --> 03:20:31.870
<v Speaker 4>but I know that there's a surplus.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's too many alligators.</v>

4893
03:20:32.080 --> 03:20:33.070
<v Speaker 4>Like they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're everywhere.</v>

4894
03:20:33.071 --> 03:20:34.630
<v Speaker 4>Whenever I'm down wakeboarding in </v>
<v Speaker 4>Florida,</v>

4895
03:20:34.631 --> 03:20:35.980
<v Speaker 4>I see him all the time in the water </v>
<v Speaker 4>with,</v>

4896
03:20:35.981 --> 03:20:40.210
<v Speaker 4>it's like God dammit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Gattard did you see that one video where</v>

<v Speaker 4>course and it's a 15 footer.</v>

<v Speaker 4>video or something while that's why </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're trying to make money off of it.</v>

4903
03:20:58.780 --> 03:20:59.650
<v Speaker 4>We'll look at,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we can see it.</v>

4904
03:20:59.651 --> 03:21:01.930
<v Speaker 4>Look at that thing walking across the </v>
<v Speaker 4>golf course.</v>

4905
03:21:01.931 --> 03:21:05.760
<v Speaker 4>Look how big that is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the gate of the book.</v>

4906
03:21:06.130 --> 03:21:06.963
<v Speaker 4>It's so huge and you get it into </v>
<v Speaker 4>perspective when the guy comes into </v>

4907
03:21:09.281 --> 03:21:10.114
<v Speaker 4>focus in a little bit,</v>
