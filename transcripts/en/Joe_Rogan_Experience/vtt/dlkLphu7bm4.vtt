<v Speaker 3>I'm very sorry.</v>

37
00:01:36.581 --> 00:01:40.960
<v Speaker 3>These people wearing the stars and stripes shirts and they're standing in front</v>

38
00:01:40.961 --> 00:01:42.910
<v Speaker 3>of a big stars and stripes thing that says,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I've never seen anything like it.</v>

43
00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:55.450
<v Speaker 3>These people probably can't wait for this song to answer.</v>

44
00:01:55.451 --> 00:01:56.830
<v Speaker 3>They can just go fuck each other.</v>

45
00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.030
<v Speaker 3>I bet they just snort math and fuck the shit out of each other and then they get</v>

46
00:02:01.031 --> 00:02:01.864
<v Speaker 3>mad.</v>

47
00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.280
<v Speaker 3>They're so repressed.</v>

48
00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:04.391
<v Speaker 3>Oh Jesus.</v>

49
00:02:04.391 --> 00:02:05.320
<v Speaker 3>I can't believe I did that.</v>

50
00:02:05.321 --> 00:02:06.070
<v Speaker 3>Jesus.</v>

51
00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.790
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

52
00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:07.630
<v Speaker 3>We'll have the devil tell me,</v>

53
00:02:07.631 --> 00:02:07.701
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

54
00:02:07.701 --> 00:02:10.120
<v Speaker 3>this is the last time is the last time.</v>

55
00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.400
<v Speaker 3>And then they just meet in the same thing.</v>

56
00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.470
<v Speaker 3>You just get brain surgery.</v>

57
00:02:14.471 --> 00:02:15.161
<v Speaker 3>It's like at each other.</v>

58
00:02:15.161 --> 00:02:19.300
<v Speaker 3>Pregnant should should modes in each other make new retards.</v>

59
00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.210
<v Speaker 3>This is all what we were talking about,</v>

60
00:02:25.211 --> 00:02:25.451
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

61
00:02:25.451 --> 00:02:28.680
<v Speaker 3>This should happen to the Greeks who have it to the Romans and having to</v>

62
00:02:28.681 --> 00:02:29.514
<v Speaker 3>everybody.</v>

63
00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.840
<v Speaker 3>Eventually the fucking tribe gets watered down to the point where there's so</v>

64
00:02:34.841 --> 00:02:37.900
<v Speaker 3>many of these fuckheads that people want to pay attention to them and even want</v>

65
00:02:37.901 --> 00:02:39.700
<v Speaker 3>to elect one of their own to be the queen of the world.</v>

66
00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:41.191
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

67
00:02:41.191 --> 00:02:41.881
<v Speaker 1>people like that.</v>

68
00:02:41.881 --> 00:02:42.240
<v Speaker 1>Look at it.</v>

69
00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:43.110
<v Speaker 1>Look at the size of that audience,</v>

70
00:02:43.111 --> 00:02:43.231
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

71
00:02:43.231 --> 00:02:44.550
<v Speaker 1>There were thousands of people as last time.</v>

72
00:02:44.551 --> 00:02:46.200
<v Speaker 1>You had a thousand people for your fucking show.</v>

73
00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:47.220
<v Speaker 1>It's been a long time.</v>

74
00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:49.083
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

75
00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:50.161
<v Speaker 1>It's ridiculous,</v>

76
00:02:50.161 --> 00:02:50.431
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

77
00:02:50.431 --> 00:02:52.050
<v Speaker 1>You need to work that church angle shit.</v>
