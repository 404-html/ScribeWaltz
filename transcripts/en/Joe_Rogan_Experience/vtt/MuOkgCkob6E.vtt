1
00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:04.330
<v Speaker 1>Freak bitches if you care about what you</v>
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>

2
00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:06.210
<v Speaker 1>that's just part of the program.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

3
00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:08.280
<v Speaker 1>And that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a healthy part to that.</v>

4
00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.830
<v Speaker 1>And then like moving on from it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's easier now than it used to be.</v>

5
00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:15.880
<v Speaker 1>It would just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would live in me for a while,</v>

6
00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:16.980
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh dude,</v>

7
00:00:16.981 --> 00:00:21.360
<v Speaker 1>you forgot the words of that song.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it becomes a mental block to</v>

8
00:00:21.361 --> 00:00:23.130
<v Speaker 1>get up there and you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh shit.</v>

9
00:00:23.131 --> 00:00:23.870
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

10
00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:25.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a kicker or something,</v>

11
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a guy going to kick a field goal.</v>

12
00:00:27.241 --> 00:00:27.601
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

13
00:00:27.601 --> 00:00:29.010
<v Speaker 1>I missed that one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe I did.</v>

14
00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:30.930
<v Speaker 1>Then the next one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

15
00:00:30.931 --> 00:00:32.230
<v Speaker 1>now it's a thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

16
00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.520
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so getting over those mental blocks.</v>

17
00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.760
<v Speaker 1>Fighters lose a fight and then they come</v>
<v Speaker 1>back and then you see the discomfort.</v>

18
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.240
<v Speaker 1>You can see the confusion and the fear</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>

19
00:00:45.241 --> 00:00:46.690
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the side,</v>

20
00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.720
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychological issues or some of the</v>

21
00:00:48.721 --> 00:00:50.610
<v Speaker 1>hardest issues that people ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>overcome.</v>

22
00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.660
<v Speaker 1>And it's just literally like a pattern</v>
<v Speaker 1>of thought in your mind or if you just</v>

23
00:00:54.661 --> 00:00:57.690
<v Speaker 1>decide that you're not as good as you</v>
<v Speaker 1>used to be,</v>

24
00:00:57.691 --> 00:01:00.950
<v Speaker 1>you can manifest that and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>physically you can do all the same</v>

25
00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.000
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is so crazy.</v>

26
00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.350
<v Speaker 1>The power of thought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The power of my mind is it's pretty</v>

27
00:01:07.351 --> 00:01:12.351
<v Speaker 1>dangerous at times and being creative</v>
<v Speaker 1>and make up all kinds of crap.</v>

28
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.260
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a large was doing that just to fuck</v>

29
00:01:16.261 --> 00:01:17.250
<v Speaker 1>with me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know it.</v>

30
00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:19.350
<v Speaker 1>And then you'd talk to them later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

31
00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:20.490
<v Speaker 1>what are you talking about?</v>

32
00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

33
00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:24.800
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

34
00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.450
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a curse and a gift that creativity,</v>

35
00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how hard was it for you to get.</v>

36
00:01:29.611 --> 00:01:34.611
<v Speaker 1>So Uber</v>
<v Speaker 1>a fear was a big motivator in that for</v>

37
00:01:35.931 --> 00:01:37.060
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

39
00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.700

<v Speaker 1>much.</v>

40
00:01:43.701 --> 00:01:47.240
<v Speaker 1>That was the bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hit that my family is going to go away</v>

41
00:01:47.241 --> 00:01:50.330
<v Speaker 1>because of my behaviors that I brought</v>
<v Speaker 1>home from the road.</v>

42
00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.450
<v Speaker 1>I got kicked out of the house by my</v>
<v Speaker 1>wife.</v>

<v Speaker 1>So Rehab did Rehab really worked for me.</v>

71
00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.640
<v Speaker 1>Helen,</v>

72
00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.990
<v Speaker 1>to go for a while.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What worked for me was a</v>

73
00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:17.940
<v Speaker 1>seven weeks someplace like basically</v>
<v Speaker 1>tearing you down to bones,</v>

74
00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.820
<v Speaker 1>ripping your life apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anything you thought about yourself or</v>

75
00:03:24.821 --> 00:03:27.610
<v Speaker 1>what it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything you thought you had,</v>

76
00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.380
<v Speaker 1>your family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your career,</v>

77
00:03:29.381 --> 00:03:32.920
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything gone strip you down to just,</v>

78
00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:34.780
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're born.</v>

79
00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.750
<v Speaker 1>Here's how you were when you were born.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were okay,</v>

80
00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.190
<v Speaker 1>you're a good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good person.</v>

81
00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.870
<v Speaker 1>Let's get back to that again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they slowly rebuild you.</v>

82
00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:46.090
<v Speaker 1>And then I went to a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

83
00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.000
<v Speaker 1>another they call them aftercare places.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went there,</v>

84
00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.270
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to a couple different ones and they fine</v>

85
00:03:52.271 --> 00:03:55.420
<v Speaker 1>tune stuff and get integrated back into</v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

86
00:03:55.421 --> 00:03:57.430
<v Speaker 1>Because when you're in this cocoon and</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

87
00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:59.050
<v Speaker 1>your frigging raw,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

88
00:03:59.051 --> 00:04:02.470
<v Speaker 1>I was raw meat when I came out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can see it in that some kind of</v>

89
00:04:02.471 --> 00:04:05.050
<v Speaker 1>monster movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was pretty raw still.</v>

90
00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:09.010
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know what I could or what I</v>
<v Speaker 1>should or shouldn't do,</v>

91
00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:10.870
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

<v Speaker 1>the last place we went to was a place</v>

93
00:04:14.621 --> 00:04:18.730
<v Speaker 1>that helps relationships,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they got me and my wife together and</v>

94
00:04:18.731 --> 00:04:22.840
<v Speaker 1>we'd see people separately and then come</v>
<v Speaker 1>together and talk about what we did and</v>

95
00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:28.650
<v Speaker 1>communication frigging saved my life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>saved our family.</v>

96
00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.330
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and working through that stuff.</v>

97
00:04:31.331 --> 00:04:36.331
<v Speaker 1>So very grateful for my wife.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's the one that didn't ask for this</v>

98
00:04:36.791 --> 00:04:41.410
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She walked through fire with me and we</v>

99
00:04:41.411 --> 00:04:45.310
<v Speaker 1>walked out together stronger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>way stronger than we ever would have</v>

100
00:04:45.311 --> 00:04:47.120
<v Speaker 1>been before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

101
00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:51.010

<v Speaker 1>my kids know my struggles and</v>

102
00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:56.050
<v Speaker 1>they respect that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They respect me and a different way.</v>

103
00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:00.670
<v Speaker 1>I don't have to tell them what to do all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the time or just be like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

107
00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:09.910
<v Speaker 1>I don't need to preach to them.</v>

<v Speaker 1>but now they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now they goof with me.</v>

109
00:05:12.461 --> 00:05:17.461

<v Speaker 1>And now by some miracle they are goofing</v>

<v Speaker 2>Did it start out when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you first started doing it,</v>

119
00:05:41.301 --> 00:05:44.220
<v Speaker 2>did it feel like as you broke through</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you,</v>

120
00:05:44.221 --> 00:05:44.871
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

121
00:05:44.871 --> 00:05:47.660
<v Speaker 2>you went to therapy and you got out of</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rehab and you,</v>

122
00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:50.750
<v Speaker 2>you're going through this whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was there a,</v>

123
00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:53.120
<v Speaker 2>like a shaky leg period where you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

124
00:05:53.121 --> 00:05:55.400
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do I know who I am anymore?</v>

125
00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:56.323
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

126
00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:57.500
<v Speaker 2>That was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was.</v>

127
00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:02.110
<v Speaker 1>That is the power of the mind and how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

128
00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:06.710
<v Speaker 1>here's how my life works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And to actually just completely throw</v>

129
00:06:06.711 --> 00:06:09.140
<v Speaker 1>that away and start over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

130
00:06:09.141 --> 00:06:09.800
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>

131
00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:11.910
<v Speaker 1>who am I without this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

132
00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:14.180
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't talk to people.</v>

133
00:06:14.181 --> 00:06:15.350
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm anxious,</v>

134
00:06:15.351 --> 00:06:18.350
<v Speaker 1>I'm shy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm all of the stuff that I thought</v>

135
00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:21.730
<v Speaker 1>booze was helping me with or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

136
00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:23.600
<v Speaker 1>booze,</v>
<v Speaker 1>drugs,</v>

137
00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:26.450
<v Speaker 1>women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a shopping,</v>

138
00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:28.880
<v Speaker 1>eating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gambling,</v>

139
00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:31.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's so many things that can manifest</v>

140
00:06:31.971 --> 00:06:36.440
<v Speaker 1>out there that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it all goes back to one core thing.</v>

141
00:06:36.441 --> 00:06:38.900
<v Speaker 1>It's like I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't really know who I am.</v>

142
00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:42.860
<v Speaker 1>So it took years and years and years to</v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out,</v>

143
00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:44.300
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like that.</v>

144
00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:46.550
<v Speaker 1>That's part of me and this is part of</v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

145
00:06:46.551 --> 00:06:47.384
<v Speaker 1>The anger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

146
00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:48.420
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

147
00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:49.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the quirkiness,</v>

148
00:06:49.911 --> 00:06:53.180
<v Speaker 1>the dark part of me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these little things that make me,</v>

149
00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:55.790
<v Speaker 1>I got to hug him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I to accept him,</v>

150
00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:58.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and quit running from him and pretending</v>

151
00:06:58.371 --> 00:07:01.820
<v Speaker 1>like I am some immovable object on</v>
<v Speaker 1>stage.</v>

152
00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:04.760
<v Speaker 1>That's tough and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing can do,</v>

153
00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:06.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing going to hurt me.</v>

154
00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.500
<v Speaker 1>But inside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

155
00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:11.660
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of a cliche saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

156
00:07:11.661 --> 00:07:16.160
<v Speaker 1>the harder that external shield,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the softer the inside and the more</v>

157
00:07:16.161 --> 00:07:19.010
<v Speaker 1>vulnerable and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and balancing that,</v>

158
00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:21.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost like you're concentrating so much</v>

159
00:07:21.891 --> 00:07:23.840
<v Speaker 1>on the outside that you ignore the</v>
<v Speaker 1>inside.</v>

160
00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:24.950
<v Speaker 1>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Totally.</v>

161
00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:28.010
<v Speaker 1>And then forget what I really want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you lose yourself in that</v>

162
00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:31.010
<v Speaker 1>other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that other person and yeah,</v>

163
00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:35.510
<v Speaker 1>being in a band certainly accelerated</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

164
00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:37.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

165
00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:41.060
<v Speaker 1>there was drink and drug and all kinds</v>
<v Speaker 1>of stuff just thrown at you all the time</v>

166
00:07:41.061 --> 00:07:45.170
<v Speaker 1>and it's starts off as a fun little</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing and then it turns into whiskey and</v>

167
00:07:45.171 --> 00:07:47.510
<v Speaker 1>escape and then all of a sudden you</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't really,</v>

168
00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:49.850
<v Speaker 1>you don't remember why you're out there</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing stuff.</v>

169
00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:53.030
<v Speaker 1>I went on tour just so I could go to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Strip club,</v>

170
00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:53.511
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

171
00:07:53.511 --> 00:07:54.860
<v Speaker 1>we're going to this place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

172
00:07:54.861 --> 00:07:56.390
<v Speaker 1>and over going to drink here.</v>

173
00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:58.100
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knew all that stuff.</v>

174
00:07:58.430 --> 00:08:03.430
<v Speaker 1>But the actual playing onstage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it kind of got forgotten about a little</v>

175
00:08:03.651 --> 00:08:04.401
<v Speaker 1>bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

176
00:08:04.401 --> 00:08:06.830
<v Speaker 1>it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We get caught up in the rockstar stuff</v>

177
00:08:06.831 --> 00:08:09.140
<v Speaker 1>and there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a song on this album,</v>

178
00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:14.400
<v Speaker 1>moth into flame that directly talks</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the how fame can be this crazy</v>

179
00:08:15.681 --> 00:08:20.120
<v Speaker 1>drug.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it can completely take you over if</v>

180
00:08:20.121 --> 00:08:21.050
<v Speaker 1>you let it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

181
00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:23.720
<v Speaker 1>you're searching for that thing that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to save you.</v>

182
00:08:23.721 --> 00:08:24.980
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's you,</v>

183
00:08:24.981 --> 00:08:26.630
<v Speaker 1>it's in your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's already there.</v>

184
00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:30.160
<v Speaker 1>You just gotta you just gotTa find it</v>
<v Speaker 1>and accept it.</v>
