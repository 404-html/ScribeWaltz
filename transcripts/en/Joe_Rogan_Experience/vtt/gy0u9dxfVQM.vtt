00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:03.060
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2
00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.890
<v Speaker 1>the Joe Rogan experience podcast is brought to you by ting.</v>

3
00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:11.040
<v Speaker 1>If you go to Rogan dot [inaudible] dot com you can save yourself 25 bucks off of</v>

4
00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:16.110
<v Speaker 1>either their cell phone service or one of their bad ass android phones.</v>

5
00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:21.330
<v Speaker 1>The idea behind ting is a company that is essentially trying to conduct business</v>

6
00:00:22.031 --> 00:00:24.310
<v Speaker 1>in an ethical way instead of trying to rip you off.</v>

7
00:00:24.311 --> 00:00:26.890
<v Speaker 1>Instead of trying to charge a ridiculous amount of money,</v>

8
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.000
<v Speaker 1>they charge less.</v>

9
00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.810
<v Speaker 1>They try not to rip you off and they can still make money and you can do</v>

10
00:00:31.811 --> 00:00:33.490
<v Speaker 1>business and not feel bad about it.</v>

11
00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:35.830
<v Speaker 1>And that's sort of the idea behind tank.</v>

12
00:00:35.831 --> 00:00:39.010
<v Speaker 1>Provide you great cell phone service on a reputable network.</v>

13
00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:40.630
<v Speaker 1>They're on the sprint network,</v>

14
00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:43.900
<v Speaker 1>so it's not like some rinky dink network that they made themselves.</v>

15
00:00:43.901 --> 00:00:46.660
<v Speaker 1>It's a big national network and it works great.</v>

16
00:00:46.661 --> 00:00:47.980
<v Speaker 1>And they have the best android phones.</v>

17
00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:48.490
<v Speaker 1>You can get.</v>

18
00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:50.440
<v Speaker 1>The Samsung Galaxy s three,</v>

19
00:00:50.441 --> 00:00:50.661
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

20
00:00:50.661 --> 00:00:51.251
<v Speaker 1>the note,</v>

21
00:00:51.251 --> 00:00:52.570
<v Speaker 1>that big giant fucking thing.</v>

22
00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:53.643
<v Speaker 1>They're amazing.</v>

23
00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:54.430
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

24
00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:55.510
<v Speaker 1>it's great service.</v>

25
00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:56.111
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

26
00:00:56.111 --> 00:00:58.090
<v Speaker 1>the idea behind it is there's no contracts.</v>

27
00:00:58.091 --> 00:00:59.290
<v Speaker 1>You cancel whenever you want to.</v>

28
00:00:59.291 --> 00:01:02.350
<v Speaker 1>You could put more than one person on an account.</v>

29
00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:05.080
<v Speaker 1>Like you can have like a little family account and all share minutes.</v>

30
00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:07.060
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of great things about it.</v>

31
00:01:07.061 --> 00:01:07.391
<v Speaker 1>If you,</v>

32
00:01:07.391 --> 00:01:08.650
<v Speaker 1>if you don't use minutes,</v>

33
00:01:08.651 --> 00:01:08.980
<v Speaker 1>they were,</v>

34
00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:11.170
<v Speaker 1>they make it up to you in the next bill.</v>

35
00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.740
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

36
00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.120
<v Speaker 1>it's a super cool company.</v>

<v Speaker 1>No one's trying to rip you off.</v>

38
00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.210
<v Speaker 1>I've had direct communication with the people behind it and they're just really</v>

39
00:01:19.211 --> 00:01:19.571

<v Speaker 3>It's why you resonate so well with all what you're doing right now is because</v>

147
00:04:03.101 --> 00:04:08.101
<v Speaker 3>you comedy pushes when you stand up in front of people and say this is the</v>

148
00:04:09.641 --> 00:04:10.270
<v Speaker 3>truth.</v>

149
00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:13.000
<v Speaker 3>And then they ha they laugh and laughter is that release,</v>

150
00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.620
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

151
00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:14.453
<v Speaker 1>Beautiful.</v>

152
00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:15.690
<v Speaker 1>I think that release,</v>

153
00:04:15.691 --> 00:04:17.370
<v Speaker 1>whatever that feeling is that when you laugh,</v>

154
00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:19.800
<v Speaker 1>but whatever that thing that makes you laugh.</v>

155
00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:21.540
<v Speaker 1>I think if that was a drug,</v>

156
00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.520
<v Speaker 1>if you could buy that like at seven 11,</v>

157
00:04:23.521 --> 00:04:24.510
<v Speaker 1>like you buy a coffee</v>

158
00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:27.700
<v Speaker 1>because when I go to see like uh,</v>

159
00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.500
<v Speaker 1>I worked this weekend with a couple of really funny guys with Brian Callen and</v>

160
00:04:31.501 --> 00:04:32.490
<v Speaker 1>Ari Shaffir and,</v>

161
00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.580
<v Speaker 1>and Brian Redman here and we worked in um,</v>

162
00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:36.340
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

163
00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:36.960
<v Speaker 1>Vegas.</v>

164
00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:37.950
<v Speaker 1>We had the show.</v>

165
00:04:37.951 --> 00:04:42.090
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things I love about like working like a really funny guys,</v>

166
00:04:42.091 --> 00:04:43.920
<v Speaker 1>it's like actually getting to laugh,</v>

167
00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:45.810
<v Speaker 1>actually getting to be an audience member.</v>

168
00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.060
<v Speaker 1>Cause like a lot of Brian counts stuff was new.</v>

169
00:04:48.061 --> 00:04:50.930
<v Speaker 1>I hadn't heard it before and I was just how then laugh at,</v>

170
00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:52.410
<v Speaker 1>it's such a good feeling.</v>

171
00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:53.550
<v Speaker 1>It's so,</v>

172
00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:54.241
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

173
00:04:54.241 --> 00:04:56.870
<v Speaker 1>and very similar in a lot of ways to the,</v>

174
00:04:56.871 --> 00:04:59.730
<v Speaker 1>the feeling that a great song can hit you.</v>

175
00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:00.371
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

176
00:05:00.371 --> 00:05:00.971
<v Speaker 3>it's what we do.</v>

177
00:05:00.971 --> 00:05:02.350
<v Speaker 3>We do very similar things.</v>

178
00:05:02.351 --> 00:05:03.580
<v Speaker 3>We take human emotion,</v>

179
00:05:03.581 --> 00:05:04.720
<v Speaker 3>human experience,</v>

180
00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:10.290
<v Speaker 3>and organize it in a way that it gets past all the normal barriers.</v>

181
00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:12.281
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

182
00:05:12.281 --> 00:05:12.940
<v Speaker 3>I can,</v>

183
00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:17.940
<v Speaker 3>I hopefully can tap into a feeling that a person has that goes beyond their</v>

184
00:05:19.511 --> 00:05:20.050
<v Speaker 3>head,</v>

185
00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:21.840
<v Speaker 3>but they go straight into their heart and,</v>

186
00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:24.640
<v Speaker 3>and then they get to release it because you know those,</v>

187
00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:25.503
<v Speaker 3>those will be,</v>

188
00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:28.870
<v Speaker 3>that'll cause you sickness too if you keep doing emotions inside.</v>

189
00:05:28.871 --> 00:05:29.770
<v Speaker 3>So comedy is the same.</v>

190
00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:30.670
<v Speaker 3>It's all about letting it,</v>

191
00:05:30.671 --> 00:05:31.504
<v Speaker 3>so</v>

192
00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:33.250
<v Speaker 1>the difference with comedy is the,</v>

193
00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.400
<v Speaker 1>your stuff gets better the more hear it.</v>

194
00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.600
<v Speaker 1>Like if I hear even like the greats,</v>

195
00:05:37.601 --> 00:05:38.470
<v Speaker 1>like Richard Pryor,</v>

196
00:05:38.471 --> 00:05:40.000
<v Speaker 1>I can only listen to like one of his bits,</v>

197
00:05:40.001 --> 00:05:40.834
<v Speaker 1>like once,</v>

198
00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:41.980
<v Speaker 1>not twice in a row,</v>

199
00:05:41.981 --> 00:05:43.120
<v Speaker 1>not three times in a week.</v>

200
00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:45.520
<v Speaker 1>I could take one of your songs and just slap it on,</v>

201
00:05:45.521 --> 00:05:48.100
<v Speaker 1>repeat and enjoy it more.</v>

202
00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:49.000
<v Speaker 1>I've come to your windows,</v>

203
00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:50.140
<v Speaker 3>it's so high.</v>

204
00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:51.980
<v Speaker 3>Just that to scares me now.</v>

205
00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:52.641
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

206
00:05:52.641 --> 00:05:53.120
<v Speaker 3>That.</v>

207
00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.440
<v Speaker 3>I'm very lucky that my,</v>

208
00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:57.530
<v Speaker 3>my art form is more like I get to,</v>

209
00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:58.370
<v Speaker 3>I can</v>

210
00:05:58.370 --> 00:05:59.121
<v Speaker 4>write a song,</v>

211
00:05:59.121 --> 00:06:01.450
<v Speaker 4>I can record it and in that moment I can put it there and they're like,</v>

212
00:06:01.451 --> 00:06:01.581
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

213
00:06:01.581 --> 00:06:02.181
<v Speaker 4>bring me some water.</v>

214
00:06:02.181 --> 00:06:02.930
<v Speaker 4>There you go.</v>

215
00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:04.190
<v Speaker 4>And then you know what?</v>

216
00:06:04.191 --> 00:06:05.024
<v Speaker 4>20 years later,</v>

217
00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:05.481
<v Speaker 4>oh my gosh,</v>

218
00:06:05.481 --> 00:06:07.670
<v Speaker 4>I get to sing and again and I can put all kinds of new stuff.</v>

219
00:06:07.671 --> 00:06:09.110
<v Speaker 4>I can do whatever I want with it.</v>

220
00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:12.250
<v Speaker 4>And people want to hear it like Yay,</v>

221
00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:13.410
<v Speaker 4>they pay money.</v>

222
00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:15.630
<v Speaker 4>It's just kind of it.</v>

223
00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:16.880
<v Speaker 4>It's like with comedy,</v>

224
00:06:16.881 --> 00:06:18.980
<v Speaker 4>you have to always keep coming up with new shit.</v>

225
00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:19.761
<v Speaker 4>Be Funny.</v>

226
00:06:19.761 --> 00:06:20.271
<v Speaker 4>Be Funny,</v>

227
00:06:20.271 --> 00:06:22.460
<v Speaker 4>dude does it last.</v>

228
00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:23.360
<v Speaker 4>You got to keep the,</v>

229
00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:26.990
<v Speaker 4>you can't like re Redo bits from decades past,</v>

230
00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:29.210
<v Speaker 4>but a great song that comes out,</v>

231
00:06:29.211 --> 00:06:29.541
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

232
00:06:29.541 --> 00:06:32.450
<v Speaker 4>that's permanently great and better with time.</v>

233
00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:33.403
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

234
00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:37.820
<v Speaker 4>it's a weird feeling to be a person who knows nothing about music.</v>

235
00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:38.200
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>

236
00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:39.050
<v Speaker 4>that's who I am.</v>

237
00:06:39.051 --> 00:06:40.590
<v Speaker 4>I really no zero nothing.</v>

238
00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:41.840
<v Speaker 4>Don't even play any instrument.</v>

239
00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:42.650
<v Speaker 4>Nope.</v>

240
00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:45.860
<v Speaker 4>Can't play anything that when I looked at music written down,</v>

241
00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:46.430
<v Speaker 4>I've never,</v>

242
00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:49.250
<v Speaker 4>never investigated it even for a second.</v>

243
00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:50.810
<v Speaker 4>But I love music.</v>

244
00:06:50.811 --> 00:06:52.070
<v Speaker 4>I love to listen to it.</v>

245
00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:54.200
<v Speaker 4>So I'd look at people like you is almost like,</v>

246
00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:57.200
<v Speaker 4>like what you do is it's like a form of magic or something.</v>

247
00:06:57.230 --> 00:07:02.230
<v Speaker 4>Like the ability to make awesome noise used to be out chemical in that it was,</v>

248
00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:07.100
<v Speaker 4>it was sacred music was because if you look at the nature of the universe and</v>

249
00:07:07.101 --> 00:07:09.740
<v Speaker 4>reality and you break it down into quantum physics,</v>

250
00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:14.700
<v Speaker 4>it is a reality that is based on octaves and dimension.</v>

251
00:07:14.701 --> 00:07:16.280
<v Speaker 4>So if you understand music,</v>

252
00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:17.570
<v Speaker 4>you can understand.</v>

253
00:07:17.571 --> 00:07:21.160
<v Speaker 4>It's one of the reasons why I understand the nature of reality so much that this</v>

254
00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:21.981
<v Speaker 4>is what happened like eight,</v>

255
00:07:21.981 --> 00:07:22.814
<v Speaker 4>nine years ago.</v>

256
00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:26.750
<v Speaker 4>And once you get to understand that we,</v>

257
00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:28.160
<v Speaker 4>that we are all octaves,</v>

258
00:07:28.161 --> 00:07:29.060
<v Speaker 4>we are all instruments,</v>

259
00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:31.790
<v Speaker 4>we're all vibrational beings,</v>

260
00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:32.990
<v Speaker 4>then you understand,</v>

261
00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:33.081
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

262
00:07:33.081 --> 00:07:33.470
<v Speaker 4>music.</v>

263
00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:35.060
<v Speaker 4>That's why music will never ever go away.</v>

264
00:07:35.061 --> 00:07:36.440
<v Speaker 4>That's why it resonates so much.</v>

265
00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:36.921
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

266
00:07:36.921 --> 00:07:38.840
<v Speaker 4>For a lot of people to hear that kind of talk and like,</v>

267
00:07:38.841 --> 00:07:39.860
<v Speaker 4>Oh God dammit,</v>

268
00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:41.660
<v Speaker 4>you just hit my hippie bullshit button.</v>

269
00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:43.220
<v Speaker 4>I know you're a resident.</v>

270
00:07:43.221 --> 00:07:43.610
<v Speaker 4>What do Ya,</v>

271
00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:44.141
<v Speaker 4>what are you,</v>

272
00:07:44.141 --> 00:07:46.870
<v Speaker 4>you're resonating and being great.</v>

273
00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:48.320
<v Speaker 4>What the hell does that mean?</v>

274
00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:49.040
<v Speaker 4>You know what?</v>

275
00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:49.280
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

276
00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:50.930
<v Speaker 4>and they absolutely,</v>

277
00:07:50.931 --> 00:07:51.740
<v Speaker 4>they lived there.</v>

278
00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:52.573
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

279
00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:56.570
<v Speaker 4>I have an understanding and a belief and we're all just made up of our beliefs</v>

280
00:07:57.170 --> 00:08:01.100
<v Speaker 4>and I walk with my hippie understanding belief and go on with it.</v>

281
00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:02.150
<v Speaker 4>I think there's,</v>

282
00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:03.590
<v Speaker 4>there's obviously,</v>

283
00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:04.010
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

284
00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:04.811
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

285
00:08:04.811 --> 00:08:05.421
<v Speaker 4>it's a in a,</v>

286
00:08:05.421 --> 00:08:08.360
<v Speaker 4>a beautiful and imaginative concept,</v>

287
00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:12.560
<v Speaker 4>but there's just sort of clear evidence that there's something there when like</v>

288
00:08:12.561 --> 00:08:17.030
<v Speaker 4>say if you're in your car and like that riff of back in black comes on the radio</v>

289
00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:21.410
<v Speaker 4>and it was just the perfect sound and the perfect time,</v>

290
00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:21.711
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

291
00:08:21.711 --> 00:08:23.660
<v Speaker 4>maybe your board of whatever,</v>

292
00:08:23.661 --> 00:08:24.021
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

293
00:08:24.021 --> 00:08:28.610
<v Speaker 4>you'd be annoyed by something and that that data like your whole body,</v>

294
00:08:28.611 --> 00:08:30.170
<v Speaker 4>like it's just like,</v>

295
00:08:30.171 --> 00:08:31.430
<v Speaker 4>that song is so good,</v>

296
00:08:31.431 --> 00:08:32.540
<v Speaker 4>it fires you up,</v>

297
00:08:32.541 --> 00:08:32.811
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

298
00:08:32.811 --> 00:08:34.070
<v Speaker 4>there's certain things that,</v>

299
00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:37.970
<v Speaker 4>there's a certain feeling that it does to your body that if you could just buy</v>

300
00:08:37.971 --> 00:08:38.481
<v Speaker 4>that man,</v>

301
00:08:38.481 --> 00:08:39.171
<v Speaker 4>it'd be very,</v>

302
00:08:39.171 --> 00:08:39.531
<v Speaker 4>very,</v>

303
00:08:39.531 --> 00:08:40.640
<v Speaker 4>very valuable.</v>

304
00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:41.690
<v Speaker 4>Or looking for that,</v>

305
00:08:41.691 --> 00:08:42.140
<v Speaker 4>aren't you?</v>

306
00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:43.420
<v Speaker 4>I think everybody is.</v>

307
00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:44.300
<v Speaker 4>If you could,</v>

308
00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:44.571
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

309
00:08:44.571 --> 00:08:44.781
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

310
00:08:44.781 --> 00:08:48.800
<v Speaker 4>I'm super inspired by music and I think one of the reasons being,</v>

311
00:08:48.801 --> 00:08:50.570
<v Speaker 4>because I don't understand it and because,</v>

312
00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:51.620
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

313
00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:52.580
<v Speaker 4>I don't play it,</v>

314
00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:53.810
<v Speaker 4>I can't create it.</v>

315
00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:55.870
<v Speaker 4>So when I see someone that can can,</v>

316
00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:56.381
<v Speaker 4>to me,</v>

317
00:08:56.381 --> 00:08:57.160
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

318
00:08:57.160 --> 00:08:57.551
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>

319
00:08:57.551 --> 00:09:00.460
<v Speaker 4>it's like this totally different thing than what I do.</v>

320
00:09:00.461 --> 00:09:05.461
<v Speaker 4>But I get to see the same sort of energy that makes anyone great at any art.</v>

321
00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:09.530
<v Speaker 4>I love seeing express through different mediums that,</v>

322
00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:11.470
<v Speaker 4>that pure resident,</v>

323
00:09:11.471 --> 00:09:11.681
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

324
00:09:11.681 --> 00:09:12.550
<v Speaker 4>I hate using that word again,</v>

325
00:09:12.551 --> 00:09:12.970
<v Speaker 4>but that,</v>

326
00:09:12.970 --> 00:09:15.610
<v Speaker 4>that residents of expression,</v>

327
00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:16.061
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

328
00:09:16.061 --> 00:09:18.910
<v Speaker 4>whatever it comes with that burst and it shows the world,</v>

329
00:09:18.911 --> 00:09:19.600
<v Speaker 4>whatever it is,</v>

330
00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:22.120
<v Speaker 4>whether it's in a song or whether it's in a sculpture,</v>

331
00:09:22.450 --> 00:09:23.920
<v Speaker 4>I love seeing it.</v>

332
00:09:24.310 --> 00:09:24.521
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

333
00:09:24.521 --> 00:09:25.960
<v Speaker 4>I love seeing it in all forms.</v>

334
00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:26.800
<v Speaker 4>You can,</v>

335
00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:27.250
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

336
00:09:27.250 --> 00:09:29.290
<v Speaker 4>you can go look at this.</v>

337
00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:31.620
<v Speaker 4>He can look at it scientifically and I'm,</v>

338
00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:33.850
<v Speaker 4>I'm just gonna use the word vibrational because we,</v>

339
00:09:33.851 --> 00:09:35.440
<v Speaker 4>if you study scientifically,</v>

340
00:09:35.441 --> 00:09:36.310
<v Speaker 4>not even Hippie wise,</v>

341
00:09:36.311 --> 00:09:37.930
<v Speaker 4>and he'd study quantum physics,</v>

342
00:09:37.931 --> 00:09:42.931
<v Speaker 4>you will understand the vibrational nature of the universe.</v>

343
00:09:43.210 --> 00:09:47.140
<v Speaker 4>And so art gives off a vibration.</v>

344
00:09:47.230 --> 00:09:47.621
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>

345
00:09:47.621 --> 00:09:48.180
<v Speaker 4>You can break it down.</v>

346
00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:48.261
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>

347
00:09:48.261 --> 00:09:49.030
<v Speaker 4>they have,</v>

348
00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:54.030
<v Speaker 4>they have little machines that can show if someone's looking at a picture and</v>

349
00:09:55.001 --> 00:09:59.980
<v Speaker 4>they have a feeling you have a vibrational energetic change inside of you as a</v>

350
00:09:59.981 --> 00:10:01.030
<v Speaker 4>reaction to that.</v>

351
00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:02.200
<v Speaker 4>Wow,</v>

352
00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:02.910
<v Speaker 4>that's amazing.</v>

353
00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:05.640
<v Speaker 5>They actually just had something the other day I think yesterday where they have</v>

354
00:10:05.641 --> 00:10:06.180
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

355
00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:08.070
<v Speaker 5>they showed the first thought,</v>

356
00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:08.430
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

357
00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:09.590
<v Speaker 5>like where uh,</v>

358
00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:10.800
<v Speaker 5>the brain of a,</v>

359
00:10:10.801 --> 00:10:12.340
<v Speaker 5>I think it was a rat and it,</v>

360
00:10:12.341 --> 00:10:12.771
<v Speaker 5>it they,</v>

361
00:10:12.771 --> 00:10:12.970
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

362
00:10:12.970 --> 00:10:14.160
<v Speaker 5>because they could see it,</v>

363
00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:14.760
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

364
00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:17.010
<v Speaker 5>like visually see a thought.</v>

365
00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:17.881
<v Speaker 5>I'll try to find it.</v>

366
00:10:17.881 --> 00:10:19.130
<v Speaker 5>But it was really bad as it was just,</v>

367
00:10:19.450 --> 00:10:19.571
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

368
00:10:19.571 --> 00:10:24.300
<v Speaker 4>I know they've been able to figure out how to take an image of what you,</v>

369
00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:25.660
<v Speaker 4>what you can see.</v>

370
00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:28.600
<v Speaker 4>They'd be able to like simple shapes.</v>

371
00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:31.000
<v Speaker 4>I go a simple triangle and simple squares.</v>

372
00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:35.200
<v Speaker 4>They've been able to take images like they've somehow or another that's reading</v>

373
00:10:35.201 --> 00:10:35.981
<v Speaker 4>your mind essentially.</v>

374
00:10:35.981 --> 00:10:36.820
<v Speaker 4>And that's a beginning,</v>

375
00:10:36.850 --> 00:10:37.683
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

376
00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:42.400
<v Speaker 4>I believe it's the whole experience of all of us understanding that thought</v>

377
00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:45.460
<v Speaker 4>creates in that and that's what all of this is made up.</v>

378
00:10:45.550 --> 00:10:46.030
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

379
00:10:46.030 --> 00:10:48.480
<v Speaker 4>He's thought that's a weird thing for people to wrap their head around.</v>

380
00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:50.230
<v Speaker 4>And what I always try to say is like,</v>

381
00:10:50.470 --> 00:10:50.711
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

382
00:10:50.711 --> 00:10:53.860
<v Speaker 4>everybody looks at the imagination as if almost as if it's not necessary,</v>

383
00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:55.593
<v Speaker 4>but you know what I mean?</v>

384
00:10:56.170 --> 00:10:58.840
<v Speaker 4>He's a childish one with his wild imagination,</v>

385
00:10:59.050 --> 00:10:59.470
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

386
00:10:59.470 --> 00:11:01.660
<v Speaker 4>And that that sort of term,</v>

387
00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:05.020
<v Speaker 4>what what people don't understand is that's what created everything.</v>

388
00:11:05.050 --> 00:11:05.950
<v Speaker 4>Everything hard,</v>

389
00:11:05.951 --> 00:11:06.251
<v Speaker 4>everything.</v>

390
00:11:06.251 --> 00:11:06.851
<v Speaker 4>You can touch,</v>

391
00:11:06.851 --> 00:11:10.120
<v Speaker 4>everything you get in and fly everything you drive around in.</v>

392
00:11:10.270 --> 00:11:12.310
<v Speaker 4>That's all coming from imagination.</v>

393
00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:13.240
<v Speaker 4>It started with,</v>

394
00:11:13.241 --> 00:11:13.960
<v Speaker 4>yes,</v>

395
00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:14.620
<v Speaker 4>all of it.</v>

396
00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:15.880
<v Speaker 4>Everything that we've created,</v>

397
00:11:15.881 --> 00:11:16.780
<v Speaker 4>good or bad,</v>

398
00:11:16.930 --> 00:11:21.930
<v Speaker 4>it's coming from an imagination like the idea that we don't put a lot of respect</v>

399
00:11:22.270 --> 00:11:24.490
<v Speaker 4>in in that and that we don't look at that.</v>

400
00:11:24.491 --> 00:11:28.810
<v Speaker 4>It's like being this and that's the real sort of sacred creator of the universe.</v>

401
00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:29.321
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>

402
00:11:29.321 --> 00:11:29.861
<v Speaker 4>Creation.</v>

403
00:11:29.861 --> 00:11:30.400
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>

404
00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:32.220
<v Speaker 4>And it starts with our own responsibility,</v>

405
00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:34.010
<v Speaker 4>what we create for ourselves every day.</v>

406
00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:36.700
<v Speaker 4>And that's difficult because people want to blame.</v>

407
00:11:37.210 --> 00:11:37.691
<v Speaker 4>They want to say,</v>

408
00:11:37.691 --> 00:11:37.841
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

409
00:11:37.841 --> 00:11:40.510
<v Speaker 4>this happened to me because of that person,</v>

410
00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:44.620
<v Speaker 4>because I don't have enough money or I don't have enough love or whatever it is</v>

411
00:11:44.710 --> 00:11:47.860
<v Speaker 4>that blame and it's hard to look at your own creation of what you created</v>

412
00:11:47.950 --> 00:11:48.460
<v Speaker 4>everyday.</v>

413
00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:50.470
<v Speaker 4>We're so malleable,</v>

414
00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:51.011
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

415
00:11:51.011 --> 00:11:53.440
<v Speaker 4>and if I think we grow up in the wrong environments,</v>

416
00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:58.780
<v Speaker 4>it's very easy to also raise children in the same environment and repeat this</v>

417
00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:03.430
<v Speaker 4>really fucked up pattern where no one has ever stopped the train and said,</v>

418
00:12:03.431 --> 00:12:03.791
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

419
00:12:03.791 --> 00:12:06.760
<v Speaker 4>let's look at the patterns that we operate under and how many of these are</v>

420
00:12:06.761 --> 00:12:07.594
<v Speaker 4>beneficial?</v>

421
00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:08.560
<v Speaker 4>What are we doing?</v>

422
00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:10.870
<v Speaker 4>Like why are we living in the same goddamn way?</v>

423
00:12:10.871 --> 00:12:11.900
<v Speaker 4>And everybody's miserable?</v>

424
00:12:11.901 --> 00:12:13.780
<v Speaker 4>Let's just stop and think this through.</v>

425
00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:14.411
<v Speaker 4>And No,</v>

426
00:12:14.411 --> 00:12:15.550
<v Speaker 4>let's not yell at each other.</v>

427
00:12:15.551 --> 00:12:16.570
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to be yelled at.</v>

428
00:12:16.571 --> 00:12:18.370
<v Speaker 4>You don't want to yell at me and I don't want to yell at you.</v>

429
00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:18.880
<v Speaker 4>Great.</v>

430
00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:19.121
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

431
00:12:19.121 --> 00:12:19.781
<v Speaker 4>We agreed to that.</v>

432
00:12:19.781 --> 00:12:20.620
<v Speaker 4>Will that we told him we won't.</v>

433
00:12:20.621 --> 00:12:21.190
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

434
00:12:21.190 --> 00:12:23.350
<v Speaker 4>Now let's think things through what?</v>

435
00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:23.920
<v Speaker 4>We know what,</v>

436
00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:24.311
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

437
00:12:24.311 --> 00:12:26.530
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck are we doing on this planet?</v>

438
00:12:26.950 --> 00:12:31.950
<v Speaker 4>We're enjoying our company and we can do that or we can just create chaos and</v>

439
00:12:33.191 --> 00:12:34.540
<v Speaker 4>create problems everywhere we go.</v>

440
00:12:34.541 --> 00:12:35.830
<v Speaker 4>If we repeat the same patterns,</v>

441
00:12:36.070 --> 00:12:37.630
<v Speaker 4>which were like to do,</v>

442
00:12:37.631 --> 00:12:39.700
<v Speaker 4>if somehow or another,</v>

443
00:12:39.701 --> 00:12:40.780
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't reset itself.</v>

444
00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:41.733
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

445
00:12:42.070 --> 00:12:46.030
<v Speaker 4>I actually feel like we're in a big resetting right now.</v>

446
00:12:46.031 --> 00:12:46.900
<v Speaker 4>Like I can feel it.</v>

447
00:12:46.901 --> 00:12:48.820
<v Speaker 4>I can start to see it in the people around me.</v>

448
00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:53.820
<v Speaker 4>And just that there's a way that you can reach anybody who would like to listen</v>

449
00:12:54.071 --> 00:12:54.461
<v Speaker 4>to you can,</v>

450
00:12:54.461 --> 00:12:55.090
<v Speaker 4>you can,</v>

451
00:12:55.090 --> 00:12:56.050
<v Speaker 4>you can do that right now.</v>

452
00:12:56.051 --> 00:13:00.010
<v Speaker 4>That is different that 10 years ago you weren't no available like this.</v>

453
00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:00.431
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

454
00:13:00.431 --> 00:13:00.731
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

455
00:13:00.731 --> 00:13:02.260
<v Speaker 4>10 years ago there was nothing like this.</v>

456
00:13:02.290 --> 00:13:02.720
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

457
00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:04.840
<v Speaker 4>You would have to put it on a radio show.</v>

458
00:13:04.841 --> 00:13:07.400
<v Speaker 4>They would put you in jail to crazy job,</v>

459
00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:08.623
<v Speaker 4>lost it all.</v>

460
00:13:08.950 --> 00:13:09.521
<v Speaker 4>They would tell you,</v>

461
00:13:09.521 --> 00:13:10.690
<v Speaker 4>you're out of your mind for every,</v>

462
00:13:10.691 --> 00:13:13.150
<v Speaker 4>almost everything you're talking about illegal drugs.</v>

463
00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:15.760
<v Speaker 4>But I was listening the other day,</v>

464
00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:16.160
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

465
00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:16.720
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

466
00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:17.080
<v Speaker 4>are,</v>

467
00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:17.320
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

468
00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:19.690
<v Speaker 4>was reading rather about the Hollywood sign.</v>

469
00:13:19.691 --> 00:13:19.931
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

470
00:13:19.931 --> 00:13:21.730
<v Speaker 4>the Hollywood sign used to be Hollywood land.</v>

471
00:13:21.731 --> 00:13:22.240
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

472
00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:27.240
<v Speaker 4>And at one point in [inaudible] 76 somebody got up there and made it Hollyweed</v>

473
00:13:28.450 --> 00:13:33.220
<v Speaker 4>because they passed some decriminalization law in California close to being</v>

474
00:13:33.221 --> 00:13:36.430
<v Speaker 4>legal nationally during Carter's administration.</v>

475
00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:37.030
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

476
00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:38.030
<v Speaker 4>So close.</v>

477
00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:38.541
<v Speaker 4>So yeah,</v>

478
00:13:38.541 --> 00:13:38.701
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

479
00:13:38.701 --> 00:13:39.160
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

480
00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:40.750
<v Speaker 4>if you really look into the,</v>

481
00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:42.640
<v Speaker 4>the journey of cannabis,</v>

482
00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:42.960
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

483
00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:43.171
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

484
00:13:43.171 --> 00:13:44.004
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

485
00:13:44.170 --> 00:13:45.400
<v Speaker 4>it's criminal and it's,</v>

486
00:13:45.401 --> 00:13:45.790
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

487
00:13:45.790 --> 00:13:47.320
<v Speaker 4>what they've done to this,</v>

488
00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:49.270
<v Speaker 4>this natural product.</v>

489
00:13:49.570 --> 00:13:50.540
<v Speaker 4>It's ridiculous.</v>

490
00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:52.060
<v Speaker 4>It's really bad.</v>

491
00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:55.240
<v Speaker 4>And the people that are trying to keep it illegal,</v>

492
00:13:55.241 --> 00:13:57.340
<v Speaker 4>or the people who could benefit from it the most,</v>

493
00:13:57.520 --> 00:13:57.880
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

494
00:13:57.880 --> 00:13:58.410
<v Speaker 4>he's,</v>

495
00:13:58.410 --> 00:13:59.020
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

496
00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:00.320
<v Speaker 4>those people all need to get onto it.</v>

497
00:14:01.650 --> 00:14:02.510
<v Speaker 4>That's what I love when,</v>

498
00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:04.830
<v Speaker 4>when Colorado and Denver and Colorado is doing that thing there,</v>

499
00:14:05.270 --> 00:14:05.560
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

500
00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:06.161
<v Speaker 4>making it legal,</v>

501
00:14:06.161 --> 00:14:06.551
<v Speaker 4>they're saying,</v>

502
00:14:06.551 --> 00:14:07.240
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

503
00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:08.520
<v Speaker 4>it's just better than you.</v>

504
00:14:08.521 --> 00:14:08.600
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

505
00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:08.860
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

506
00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:10.060
<v Speaker 4>You're not going to get in a fight.</v>

507
00:14:10.061 --> 00:14:11.470
<v Speaker 4>You go to the barn,</v>

508
00:14:11.490 --> 00:14:11.621
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

509
00:14:11.621 --> 00:14:11.920
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

510
00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:12.760
<v Speaker 4>have a smoke,</v>

511
00:14:12.761 --> 00:14:13.600
<v Speaker 4>you're going to be chilled.</v>

512
00:14:13.601 --> 00:14:14.380
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

513
00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:15.760
<v Speaker 4>you're not going to cause damage.</v>

514
00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:16.241
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

515
00:14:16.241 --> 00:14:19.570
<v Speaker 4>You're not going to just become a crazy person who can't even drive.</v>

516
00:14:19.830 --> 00:14:20.030
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

517
00:14:20.030 --> 00:14:25.030
<v Speaker 4>that's unbelievable that almost everywhere in America are these spots where you</v>

518
00:14:25.601 --> 00:14:29.740
<v Speaker 4>can get fueled up with a drug that makes your body not work so well.</v>

519
00:14:29.830 --> 00:14:32.290
<v Speaker 4>And we're fine with that car getting your car.</v>

520
00:14:32.291 --> 00:14:35.890
<v Speaker 4>And of course we don't want you to drunk drive and we pray take cabs and we</v>

521
00:14:35.891 --> 00:14:36.724
<v Speaker 4>always say that.</v>

522
00:14:36.730 --> 00:14:38.920
<v Speaker 4>However the possibility is always there.</v>

523
00:14:39.070 --> 00:14:43.030
<v Speaker 4>You're talking about a drug that massively inhibits your thinking process and</v>

524
00:14:43.031 --> 00:14:47.560
<v Speaker 4>makes you do really irrational shit and you're combining it with the access to a</v>

525
00:14:47.561 --> 00:14:47.951
<v Speaker 4>car.</v>

526
00:14:47.951 --> 00:14:51.870
<v Speaker 4>I mean the idea that people see through that our society was built on that.</v>

527
00:14:51.871 --> 00:14:52.080
<v Speaker 4>All</v>

528
00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:52.913
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

529
00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:54.690
<v Speaker 3>it's that worker society.</v>

530
00:14:54.691 --> 00:14:58.170
<v Speaker 3>Keep them on the caffeine and the sugar and the alcohol.</v>

531
00:14:59.070 --> 00:15:01.650
<v Speaker 4>Oh and do you think it's a self fulfilling sort of a thing?</v>

532
00:15:01.651 --> 00:15:03.000
<v Speaker 4>Cause those things are all awesome.</v>

533
00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:03.873
<v Speaker 4>That's</v>

534
00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:06.540
<v Speaker 4>caffeine is awesome.</v>

535
00:15:06.541 --> 00:15:07.050
<v Speaker 4>Sugars.</v>

536
00:15:07.050 --> 00:15:07.640
<v Speaker 4>Awesome.</v>

537
00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:08.410
<v Speaker 4>The alcoholism,</v>

538
00:15:08.410 --> 00:15:09.200
<v Speaker 4>the shit.</v>

539
00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:10.140
<v Speaker 4>It's all good stuff.</v>

540
00:15:10.170 --> 00:15:12.690
<v Speaker 4>So I mean is it possible that we just like it,</v>

541
00:15:13.270 --> 00:15:14.103
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

542
00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:17.810
<v Speaker 3>instead of caffeine changed the world and sugar too.</v>

543
00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:18.120
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

544
00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:20.570
<v Speaker 3>it was what brought industry too,</v>

545
00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:21.080
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

546
00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:23.160
<v Speaker 3>Britain and that's why colonialism happen.</v>

547
00:15:23.161 --> 00:15:26.520
<v Speaker 3>That's why they conquered the world so they could bring spice and taste and</v>

548
00:15:26.521 --> 00:15:27.354
<v Speaker 3>sugar.</v>

549
00:15:27.450 --> 00:15:29.460
<v Speaker 3>And in the 18 hundreds of the,</v>

550
00:15:29.461 --> 00:15:30.030
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

551
00:15:30.030 --> 00:15:31.770
<v Speaker 3>the British doctors were like,</v>

552
00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:32.111
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>

553
00:15:32.111 --> 00:15:32.611
<v Speaker 3>wait a minute.</v>

554
00:15:32.611 --> 00:15:34.590
<v Speaker 3>We're seeing all these new diseases now because of sugar.</v>

555
00:15:34.591 --> 00:15:34.750
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

556
00:15:34.750 --> 00:15:35.251
<v Speaker 3>it's a drug,</v>

557
00:15:35.251 --> 00:15:35.551
<v Speaker 3>it's a drug.</v>

558
00:15:35.551 --> 00:15:35.871
<v Speaker 3>And they were like,</v>

559
00:15:35.871 --> 00:15:36.030
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

560
00:15:36.030 --> 00:15:36.863
<v Speaker 3>too late.</v>

561
00:15:37.770 --> 00:15:42.180
<v Speaker 3>Once they had figured out how to extract sugar from natural products,</v>

562
00:15:42.181 --> 00:15:46.610
<v Speaker 3>and then you can get these massive doses of it right into your bloodstream,</v>

563
00:15:47.010 --> 00:15:49.050
<v Speaker 3>eat spoons of sugar kids.</v>

564
00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:50.340
<v Speaker 3>Do you see the,</v>

565
00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:51.240
<v Speaker 3>they get a little,</v>

566
00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:51.451
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

567
00:15:51.451 --> 00:15:53.440
<v Speaker 3>we got a cupcake at school and they lose their mind.</v>

568
00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:54.181
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

569
00:15:54.181 --> 00:15:56.430
<v Speaker 4>I gave my little one cotton candy yesterday.</v>

570
00:15:57.240 --> 00:15:58.130
<v Speaker 4>She went off.</v>

571
00:15:58.710 --> 00:15:59.251
<v Speaker 4>She went off.</v>

572
00:15:59.251 --> 00:16:00.360
<v Speaker 4>She only weighs like 30 pounds.</v>

573
00:16:00.361 --> 00:16:01.194
<v Speaker 4>You're like a pounding.</v>

574
00:16:01.410 --> 00:16:02.100
<v Speaker 3>Say It's,</v>

575
00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:02.933
<v Speaker 3>it's tough.</v>

576
00:16:02.970 --> 00:16:03.750
<v Speaker 3>It's tough.</v>

577
00:16:03.750 --> 00:16:04.583
<v Speaker 3>It's a drug.</v>

578
00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:05.910
<v Speaker 3>And for drug wrecks,</v>

579
00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.060
<v Speaker 3>our immune system sugar just totally wrecks our immune system.</v>

580
00:16:09.061 --> 00:16:10.950
<v Speaker 3>And that's why a lot of us are so sick.</v>

581
00:16:11.090 --> 00:16:11.570
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

582
00:16:11.570 --> 00:16:13.820
<v Speaker 4>it's really close to like a toxin.</v>

583
00:16:14.110 --> 00:16:14.301
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

584
00:16:14.301 --> 00:16:16.400
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of people that are trying to say it's a car.</v>

585
00:16:16.530 --> 00:16:18.950
<v Speaker 4>So I felt fed my baby a delicious toxin.</v>

586
00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:21.050
<v Speaker 4>But it's fine.</v>

587
00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:22.010
<v Speaker 4>They're so available.</v>

588
00:16:22.011 --> 00:16:25.070
<v Speaker 4>And they do have kids going to want it.</v>

589
00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:26.750
<v Speaker 4>Can't have it every day.</v>

590
00:16:26.751 --> 00:16:27.350
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

591
00:16:27.350 --> 00:16:28.370
<v Speaker 4>every day you'd healthy.</v>

592
00:16:28.371 --> 00:16:30.260
<v Speaker 4>But if you're at Disneyland,</v>

593
00:16:30.261 --> 00:16:30.561
<v Speaker 4>fuck,</v>

594
00:16:30.561 --> 00:16:32.060
<v Speaker 4>it's time to go off and go.</v>

595
00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:35.030
<v Speaker 4>They sell cotton candy machines at target for the kids.</v>

596
00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:38.030
<v Speaker 4>These little machines,</v>

597
00:16:38.031 --> 00:16:39.160
<v Speaker 4>they're like 50 bucks.</v>

598
00:16:39.190 --> 00:16:40.790
<v Speaker 4>You make your own cotton candy.</v>

599
00:16:41.510 --> 00:16:42.380
<v Speaker 4>That's so wrong.</v>

600
00:16:43.310 --> 00:16:45.050
<v Speaker 4>That's just pure sugar.</v>

601
00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:46.750
<v Speaker 3>And then put them in front of TV and you'd,</v>

602
00:16:46.751 --> 00:16:47.420
<v Speaker 3>you've got,</v>

603
00:16:47.420 --> 00:16:49.620
<v Speaker 3>we've brainwashed him and then it's all good.</v>

604
00:16:49.830 --> 00:16:50.663
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

605
00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:52.260
<v Speaker 3>And then they're ready to be plugged in,</v>

606
00:16:52.770 --> 00:16:53.730
<v Speaker 3>unfortunately,</v>

607
00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:55.890
<v Speaker 3>but is awesome too.</v>

608
00:16:55.891 --> 00:16:57.230
<v Speaker 3>That's also probably exactly.</v>

609
00:16:58.460 --> 00:16:59.790
<v Speaker 3>I am not a,</v>

610
00:16:59.791 --> 00:17:00.330
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

611
00:17:00.330 --> 00:17:01.163
<v Speaker 3>I'm a not a,</v>

612
00:17:01.350 --> 00:17:02.580
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to do any of this.</v>

613
00:17:02.630 --> 00:17:02.910
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

614
00:17:02.910 --> 00:17:05.040
<v Speaker 3>I believe in all of these things in moderation.</v>

615
00:17:05.070 --> 00:17:07.500
<v Speaker 3>It's all about balance because I don't want to be the other way.</v>

616
00:17:07.501 --> 00:17:08.340
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to be,</v>

617
00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:10.020
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to do this and this and this and that,</v>

618
00:17:10.021 --> 00:17:13.610
<v Speaker 3>because those things are fun and they're beautiful in the ad tastes and spice to</v>

619
00:17:13.620 --> 00:17:14.220
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>

620
00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:16.140
<v Speaker 3>And I want that balance.</v>

621
00:17:16.141 --> 00:17:17.640
<v Speaker 3>And it's just about balance.</v>

622
00:17:17.870 --> 00:17:18.181
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

623
00:17:18.181 --> 00:17:19.290
<v Speaker 3>It's a moderation thing,</v>

624
00:17:19.291 --> 00:17:19.501
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

625
00:17:19.501 --> 00:17:24.060
<v Speaker 3>It's like figuring out how to ride the waves of not be addicted to it,</v>

626
00:17:24.061 --> 00:17:25.500
<v Speaker 3>not victim to it,</v>

627
00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:28.270
<v Speaker 4>but also enjoy a little TV every now and again.</v>

628
00:17:28.271 --> 00:17:28.491
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

629
00:17:28.491 --> 00:17:28.800
<v Speaker 4>Ham,</v>

630
00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:29.890
<v Speaker 4>some good shows off.</v>

631
00:17:29.891 --> 00:17:30.160
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

632
00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:31.060
<v Speaker 4>what's wrong with you?</v>

633
00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:33.610
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't mean the shutting off the world.</v>

634
00:17:33.611 --> 00:17:36.010
<v Speaker 4>I think that it's not an either or situation.</v>

635
00:17:36.340 --> 00:17:37.370
<v Speaker 4>I think if you know what,</v>

636
00:17:37.570 --> 00:17:39.280
<v Speaker 3>what you're being manipulated by,</v>

637
00:17:39.281 --> 00:17:41.260
<v Speaker 3>when you see like an advertisement of,</v>

638
00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:44.620
<v Speaker 3>you understand the manipulation behind it,</v>

639
00:17:44.650 --> 00:17:44.861
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

640
00:17:44.861 --> 00:17:45.430
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

641
00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:46.270
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

642
00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:49.030
<v Speaker 3>you know what they are intending.</v>

643
00:17:49.530 --> 00:17:50.251
<v Speaker 3>If you know that,</v>

644
00:17:50.251 --> 00:17:51.360
<v Speaker 3>then you can be safe and go in,</v>

645
00:17:51.361 --> 00:17:53.880
<v Speaker 3>but if you go in and just watch mindlessly and more,</v>

646
00:17:53.881 --> 00:17:55.890
<v Speaker 3>you will be swept away in it.</v>

647
00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:56.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

648
00:17:56.460 --> 00:17:57.570
<v Speaker 3>It's like a balance issue,</v>

649
00:17:57.571 --> 00:17:57.900
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

650
00:17:57.900 --> 00:17:58.530
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

651
00:17:58.530 --> 00:18:00.170
<v Speaker 3>I think there's just got to figure out how,</v>

652
00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:01.433
<v Speaker 3>how do you do it?</v>

653
00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:02.303
<v Speaker 3>How do I do it?</v>

654
00:18:03.570 --> 00:18:06.630
<v Speaker 3>It's a constant practice every single day.</v>

655
00:18:06.631 --> 00:18:08.790
<v Speaker 3>It started when I went through breast cancer.</v>

656
00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:10.320
<v Speaker 3>It's that sort of,</v>

657
00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:11.150
<v Speaker 3>Oh fuck,</v>

658
00:18:11.150 --> 00:18:12.180
<v Speaker 3>I could die in.</v>

659
00:18:12.181 --> 00:18:12.500
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>

660
00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:12.990
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

661
00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:13.411
<v Speaker 3>wait a minute.</v>

662
00:18:13.411 --> 00:18:13.581
<v Speaker 3>This,</v>

663
00:18:13.581 --> 00:18:14.414
<v Speaker 3>this is serious.</v>

664
00:18:14.890 --> 00:18:15.490
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>

665
00:18:15.490 --> 00:18:16.170
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

666
00:18:16.170 --> 00:18:17.003
<v Speaker 3>I had this,</v>

667
00:18:17.830 --> 00:18:19.230
<v Speaker 3>I actually ate,</v>

668
00:18:19.410 --> 00:18:20.640
<v Speaker 3>it was one of those senior,</v>

669
00:18:20.641 --> 00:18:21.474
<v Speaker 3>you're talking about we,</v>

670
00:18:21.510 --> 00:18:22.321
<v Speaker 3>before we went over,</v>

671
00:18:22.321 --> 00:18:24.850
<v Speaker 3>you're talking about cannabis and actually the difference between smoking in an</v>

672
00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:25.590
<v Speaker 3>eating it.</v>

673
00:18:25.590 --> 00:18:28.710
<v Speaker 3>And I eaten a couple of cookies and they were of course delicious.</v>

674
00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:30.720
<v Speaker 3>I had a bit more than I should.</v>

675
00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:35.400
<v Speaker 3>And I had one of those really severe trips.</v>

676
00:18:35.850 --> 00:18:40.850
<v Speaker 3>And in that came a very clear understanding of the nature of life,</v>

677
00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:42.470
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

678
00:18:42.470 --> 00:18:43.280
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

679
00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:44.540
<v Speaker 3>of balance of,</v>

680
00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:46.230
<v Speaker 3>and I came back,</v>

681
00:18:46.410 --> 00:18:47.820
<v Speaker 3>went through breast cancer,</v>

682
00:18:48.450 --> 00:18:49.283
<v Speaker 3>went through the,</v>

683
00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:50.580
<v Speaker 3>the system.</v>

684
00:18:50.581 --> 00:18:51.540
<v Speaker 3>I did the chemo,</v>

685
00:18:51.541 --> 00:18:51.721
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

686
00:18:51.721 --> 00:18:55.140
<v Speaker 3>I was on bald and I did all that and I gotta have it and going,</v>

687
00:18:55.141 --> 00:18:55.530
<v Speaker 3>wait a minute,</v>

688
00:18:55.530 --> 00:18:56.730
<v Speaker 3>while I'm in this,</v>

689
00:18:56.880 --> 00:18:58.440
<v Speaker 3>every doctor I had kept saying,</v>

690
00:18:58.620 --> 00:19:00.420
<v Speaker 3>cancer starts when sales go bad.</v>

691
00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:01.681
<v Speaker 3>And I go,</v>

692
00:19:01.681 --> 00:19:02.040
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

693
00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:03.120
<v Speaker 3>well why do cells go bad?</v>

694
00:19:03.121 --> 00:19:04.320
<v Speaker 3>And none of them would answer me.</v>

695
00:19:04.321 --> 00:19:07.680
<v Speaker 3>None of them had that answer because that's the way our medical system is set</v>

696
00:19:07.681 --> 00:19:08.070
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>

697
00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:11.430
<v Speaker 3>And this has been a journey of finding out why did my cells go bad?</v>

698
00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:12.480
<v Speaker 3>Why did they go back?</v>

699
00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:13.313
<v Speaker 3>It was the,</v>

700
00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:14.370
<v Speaker 3>it was my nutrition,</v>

701
00:19:14.490 --> 00:19:15.540
<v Speaker 3>it was my stress.</v>

702
00:19:16.110 --> 00:19:16.441
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>

703
00:19:16.441 --> 00:19:17.011
<v Speaker 3>I didn't drink enough.</v>

704
00:19:17.011 --> 00:19:21.630
<v Speaker 3>Water is very simple stuff and it's about an emotional imbalance.</v>

705
00:19:21.631 --> 00:19:24.600
<v Speaker 3>We got to bring emotion back into balance in the body.</v>

706
00:19:25.570 --> 00:19:25.940
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

707
00:19:25.940 --> 00:19:26.241
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

708
00:19:26.241 --> 00:19:30.210
<v Speaker 3>it's as much of a factor I believe as all the other things in your body,</v>

709
00:19:30.211 --> 00:19:30.841
<v Speaker 3>your blood,</v>

710
00:19:30.841 --> 00:19:31.591
<v Speaker 3>your tissues,</v>

711
00:19:31.591 --> 00:19:32.281
<v Speaker 3>your bone.</v>

712
00:19:32.281 --> 00:19:33.240
<v Speaker 3>I think your,</v>

713
00:19:33.241 --> 00:19:37.140
<v Speaker 3>your emotional health is as important as your,</v>

714
00:19:37.141 --> 00:19:38.640
<v Speaker 3>your biological health,</v>

715
00:19:38.890 --> 00:19:40.050
<v Speaker 3>health of your actual body.</v>

716
00:19:40.051 --> 00:19:40.920
<v Speaker 3>If they're connected.</v>

717
00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:41.460
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

718
00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:41.881
<v Speaker 3>it was.</v>

719
00:19:41.881 --> 00:19:42.714
<v Speaker 3>The um,</v>

720
00:19:43.050 --> 00:19:48.050
<v Speaker 3>unfortunately was the Catholic church in 400 and when day they cart decided that</v>

721
00:19:48.751 --> 00:19:48.911
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

722
00:19:48.911 --> 00:19:49.560
<v Speaker 3>he was like,</v>

723
00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:51.900
<v Speaker 3>I went to the church and he said I want to study medicine.</v>

724
00:19:51.901 --> 00:19:53.940
<v Speaker 3>I want to study the human body.</v>

725
00:19:53.941 --> 00:19:54.361
<v Speaker 3>And they said,</v>

726
00:19:54.361 --> 00:19:54.631
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

727
00:19:54.631 --> 00:19:55.380
<v Speaker 3>you can study.</v>

728
00:19:55.380 --> 00:19:56.280
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't medicine yet.</v>

729
00:19:56.281 --> 00:19:57.420
<v Speaker 3>He invented medicine.</v>

730
00:19:57.840 --> 00:19:58.471
<v Speaker 3>They said okay,</v>

731
00:19:58.471 --> 00:20:03.330
<v Speaker 3>you can study the body but the emotion and soul that stays with the church and</v>

732
00:20:03.331 --> 00:20:08.331
<v Speaker 3>that's one of the reasons why this break happened and all of our great thought</v>

733
00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:13.760
<v Speaker 3>and intention and the smartest of us for hundreds of years have only developed</v>

734
00:20:14.341 --> 00:20:16.800
<v Speaker 3>the body separate from emotion.</v>

735
00:20:16.830 --> 00:20:21.830
<v Speaker 3>And we are now seeing that break down the whole system or whole healthcare,</v>

736
00:20:21.870 --> 00:20:24.270
<v Speaker 3>everything because it,</v>

737
00:20:24.310 --> 00:20:24.750
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

738
00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:25.770
<v Speaker 3>it's just not true anymore.</v>

739
00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:28.460
<v Speaker 3>Emotion plays I,</v>

740
00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:31.150
<v Speaker 3>my belief is it plays almost all the part of,</v>

741
00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:32.830
<v Speaker 3>of disease dis ease.</v>

742
00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:34.343
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

743
00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:37.380
<v Speaker 3>But what about like little children with horrible disorders?</v>

744
00:20:37.730 --> 00:20:38.550
<v Speaker 3>I should.</v>

745
00:20:38.550 --> 00:20:40.380
<v Speaker 3>Well then you have to get into,</v>

746
00:20:41.910 --> 00:20:43.000
<v Speaker 3>and this is where it gets it.</v>

747
00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:45.690
<v Speaker 3>This is where it talks about.</v>

748
00:20:45.930 --> 00:20:47.100
<v Speaker 3>We are here to create,</v>

749
00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:49.250
<v Speaker 3>this is where we talk about we're here to create.</v>

750
00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:53.990
<v Speaker 3>We are here to work through whatever we've decided.</v>

751
00:20:53.991 --> 00:20:54.171
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

752
00:20:54.171 --> 00:20:54.400
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

753
00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:56.060
<v Speaker 3>this gets in a real spiritual stuff.</v>

754
00:20:56.061 --> 00:20:56.900
<v Speaker 3>The stuff before,</v>

755
00:20:56.901 --> 00:20:57.221
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

756
00:20:57.221 --> 00:20:57.350
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

757
00:20:57.350 --> 00:20:57.610
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

758
00:20:57.610 --> 00:20:59.990
<v Speaker 3>and it all depends on your basic belief.</v>

759
00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:02.390
<v Speaker 3>My belief is all of us have,</v>

760
00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:07.840
<v Speaker 3>all of us create what we need to work through to create and learn what we need</v>

761
00:21:08.421 --> 00:21:09.111
<v Speaker 3>to in this world.</v>

762
00:21:09.111 --> 00:21:11.480
<v Speaker 3>And so I can't look at anyone as a victim.</v>

763
00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:14.420
<v Speaker 3>I can't even a child.</v>

764
00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:16.400
<v Speaker 3>I don't blame them.</v>

765
00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:17.960
<v Speaker 3>I don't say this is your fault.</v>

766
00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:19.933
<v Speaker 3>I say,</v>

767
00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:25.960
<v Speaker 3>you made an agreement in this place to do this and I am sending you all my love.</v>

768
00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:30.980
<v Speaker 3>And I believe in you and I believe that you will,</v>

769
00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:32.810
<v Speaker 3>you can be a miracle</v>

770
00:21:35.230 --> 00:21:35.651
<v Speaker 1>when you,</v>

771
00:21:35.651 --> 00:21:36.550
<v Speaker 1>when you say that like,</v>

772
00:21:36.830 --> 00:21:41.080
<v Speaker 1>but do you mean that like when you see someone who has a disability,</v>

773
00:21:41.081 --> 00:21:42.580
<v Speaker 1>you don't see it as a disability.</v>

774
00:21:42.581 --> 00:21:46.720
<v Speaker 1>You just see that they're just another entity in this life and just go forward</v>

775
00:21:46.721 --> 00:21:49.540
<v Speaker 1>with love and it all works out in the long run.</v>

776
00:21:49.541 --> 00:21:50.650
<v Speaker 1>It all works out great anyway.</v>

777
00:21:50.710 --> 00:21:51.543
<v Speaker 1>Is that what you mean?</v>

778
00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:53.110
<v Speaker 3>What sort of,</v>

779
00:21:53.110 --> 00:21:54.500
<v Speaker 3>and it's what you,</v>

780
00:21:55.100 --> 00:21:58.460
<v Speaker 3>it's what you deem works out in the end because a lot of people have different</v>

781
00:21:58.461 --> 00:21:59.750
<v Speaker 3>ideas of what that is.</v>

782
00:22:00.260 --> 00:22:05.260
<v Speaker 3>I have tons of people that come to me who are stage four cancer and the doctors</v>

783
00:22:05.811 --> 00:22:06.780
<v Speaker 3>have said there's nothing we can do.</v>

784
00:22:06.781 --> 00:22:07.970
<v Speaker 3>You're going to die in a few weeks.</v>

785
00:22:08.390 --> 00:22:08.720
<v Speaker 3>And they,</v>

786
00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:13.720
<v Speaker 3>they come to me all the time in cities all over the world and I want to,</v>

787
00:22:14.751 --> 00:22:16.970
<v Speaker 3>and I try and sometimes it works.</v>

788
00:22:16.971 --> 00:22:21.971
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes their belief is I just give them another way of looking at it.</v>

789
00:22:22.941 --> 00:22:27.680
<v Speaker 3>If you have another perception other than cancer is something that that happens</v>

790
00:22:27.681 --> 00:22:28.400
<v Speaker 3>to me and oops,</v>

791
00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:29.233
<v Speaker 3>I got it.</v>

792
00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:35.200
<v Speaker 3>If you understand it is my body is on this journey and my emotion and you're</v>

793
00:22:35.781 --> 00:22:39.200
<v Speaker 3>willing to to dissect and and break apart.</v>

794
00:22:39.370 --> 00:22:39.560
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

795
00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:40.221
<v Speaker 3>what am I eating?</v>

796
00:22:40.221 --> 00:22:41.300
<v Speaker 3>What am I feeling?</v>

797
00:22:41.301 --> 00:22:42.200
<v Speaker 3>What am I doing?</v>

798
00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:43.220
<v Speaker 3>Where am I?</v>

799
00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:44.540
<v Speaker 3>What do I need to change?</v>

800
00:22:44.930 --> 00:22:48.200
<v Speaker 3>You can control cancer because it is a symptom.</v>

801
00:22:48.350 --> 00:22:49.250
<v Speaker 3>It is not something that happens.</v>

802
00:22:49.251 --> 00:22:54.251
<v Speaker 3>It is your own cells that have been so taxed by your [inaudible],</v>

803
00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:56.481
<v Speaker 3>your immune system,</v>

804
00:22:56.481 --> 00:22:59.610
<v Speaker 3>which has been taxed by sugar or motion or any of that stress that is sick</v>

805
00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:00.530
<v Speaker 3>stress.</v>

806
00:23:00.530 --> 00:23:04.310
<v Speaker 3>It's so taxed that then those cells go bad.</v>

807
00:23:04.580 --> 00:23:06.170
<v Speaker 1>Is it all environmental though?</v>

808
00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:07.940
<v Speaker 1>I mean is it all emotional?</v>

809
00:23:08.420 --> 00:23:09.380
<v Speaker 1>It's some Arthur,</v>

810
00:23:09.381 --> 00:23:10.910
<v Speaker 1>some random genetic rolls.</v>

811
00:23:10.911 --> 00:23:14.820
<v Speaker 1>The dice like kids that are born with massive birth defects and along those,</v>

812
00:23:15.250 --> 00:23:16.300
<v Speaker 3>well this is the lie,</v>

813
00:23:16.301 --> 00:23:16.631
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

814
00:23:16.631 --> 00:23:17.464
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

815
00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:18.461
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

816
00:23:18.461 --> 00:23:21.220
<v Speaker 3>it's how you hold reality and creation.</v>

817
00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:26.700
<v Speaker 3>I believe that this reality is one of thought.</v>

818
00:23:31.061 --> 00:23:33.310
<v Speaker 3>So whatever you are creating,</v>

819
00:23:33.311 --> 00:23:36.640
<v Speaker 3>whatever that know that that massive deformity,</v>

820
00:23:36.641 --> 00:23:37.600
<v Speaker 3>that massive thing,</v>

821
00:23:37.930 --> 00:23:39.000
<v Speaker 3>it comes from it.</v>

822
00:23:39.010 --> 00:23:39.940
<v Speaker 3>It's theirs.</v>

823
00:23:40.210 --> 00:23:41.021
<v Speaker 3>It is theirs too.</v>

824
00:23:41.021 --> 00:23:42.040
<v Speaker 3>I'm not judging it.</v>

825
00:23:42.550 --> 00:23:43.390
<v Speaker 3>I'm loving it.</v>

826
00:23:43.780 --> 00:23:45.160
<v Speaker 3>I'm not seeing them as a victim.</v>

827
00:23:45.850 --> 00:23:48.250
<v Speaker 3>I don't believe something unjust happened to them.</v>

828
00:23:48.251 --> 00:23:50.140
<v Speaker 3>And I don't believe something just happened to them.</v>

829
00:23:50.620 --> 00:23:54.940
<v Speaker 3>I believe that this is the balance of life and we are all here to walk through</v>

830
00:23:54.941 --> 00:23:56.110
<v Speaker 3>it and make our choices.</v>

831
00:23:57.370 --> 00:23:58.120
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

832
00:23:58.120 --> 00:23:59.260
<v Speaker 4>That's heavy duty stuff.</v>

833
00:24:02.470 --> 00:24:02.891
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

834
00:24:02.891 --> 00:24:03.310
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

835
00:24:03.310 --> 00:24:08.310
<v Speaker 4>I think there's something to a person that has gone through what you've gone</v>

836
00:24:08.501 --> 00:24:12.250
<v Speaker 4>through physically or you get to a real point where you're,</v>

837
00:24:12.310 --> 00:24:12.581
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

838
00:24:12.581 --> 00:24:14.590
<v Speaker 4>you're worrying about your body ending,</v>

839
00:24:14.591 --> 00:24:16.390
<v Speaker 4>you worrying about your trip being over.</v>

840
00:24:16.950 --> 00:24:21.820
<v Speaker 4>And I think the insight that people that have been through those situations and</v>

841
00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:22.450
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

842
00:24:22.450 --> 00:24:22.710
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

843
00:24:22.710 --> 00:24:27.460
<v Speaker 4>it's really remarkable and it always makes me wonder why we can't wrap our heads</v>

844
00:24:27.461 --> 00:24:29.470
<v Speaker 4>around that without a crisis.</v>

845
00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:30.890
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

846
00:24:30.890 --> 00:24:31.590
<v Speaker 3>That's what,</v>

847
00:24:31.590 --> 00:24:33.760
<v Speaker 3>that's one of the reasons why I love to come talk to you.</v>

848
00:24:33.761 --> 00:24:35.400
<v Speaker 3>It's why I want to talk,</v>

849
00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:40.880
<v Speaker 3>because I would love to just have one person not have to get to crisis,</v>

850
00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:42.990
<v Speaker 3>but to go,</v>

851
00:24:42.990 --> 00:24:43.381
<v Speaker 3>wait a minute.</v>

852
00:24:43.381 --> 00:24:44.910
<v Speaker 3>That might be the path that I'm,</v>

853
00:24:45.420 --> 00:24:46.020
<v Speaker 3>I'm on.</v>

854
00:24:46.020 --> 00:24:47.580
<v Speaker 3>Maybe this can help me.</v>

855
00:24:48.090 --> 00:24:48.691
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it can,</v>

856
00:24:48.691 --> 00:24:49.830
<v Speaker 3>because when I was in it,</v>

857
00:24:50.220 --> 00:24:53.790
<v Speaker 3>I saw what the fear of death can do.</v>

858
00:24:53.910 --> 00:24:54.743
<v Speaker 3>It it,</v>

859
00:24:54.750 --> 00:24:55.950
<v Speaker 3>it holds everyone.</v>

860
00:24:56.370 --> 00:24:57.031
<v Speaker 3>It cancer.</v>

861
00:24:57.031 --> 00:24:57.271
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

862
00:24:57.271 --> 00:24:59.400
<v Speaker 3>I still see people and it's been eight,</v>

863
00:24:59.401 --> 00:25:02.940
<v Speaker 3>nine years now since I was diagnosed and went through all that and people still</v>

864
00:25:02.941 --> 00:25:03.774
<v Speaker 3>look at me like,</v>

865
00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:05.153
<v Speaker 3>are you dying?</v>

866
00:25:05.490 --> 00:25:05.880
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

867
00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:06.300
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

868
00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:07.410
<v Speaker 3>they still hold.</v>

869
00:25:07.411 --> 00:25:08.820
<v Speaker 3>It's a powerful energy.</v>

870
00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:10.310
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

871
00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:10.721
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

872
00:25:10.721 --> 00:25:11.554
<v Speaker 4>it's um,</v>

873
00:25:12.290 --> 00:25:16.190
<v Speaker 4>it's a weird part of our life and weird part of our journey.</v>

874
00:25:16.191 --> 00:25:21.191
<v Speaker 4>The body just sort of failing prematurely in some strange way where it's growing</v>

875
00:25:21.261 --> 00:25:22.820
<v Speaker 4>its own problem.</v>

876
00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:24.040
<v Speaker 3>Well that's,</v>

877
00:25:24.580 --> 00:25:27.520
<v Speaker 3>or there is something,</v>

878
00:25:27.550 --> 00:25:29.800
<v Speaker 3>there is some choice that I'm making.</v>

879
00:25:30.370 --> 00:25:31.720
<v Speaker 3>My body is perfect.</v>

880
00:25:31.721 --> 00:25:33.820
<v Speaker 3>Every single human body is amazing.</v>

881
00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:34.401
<v Speaker 4>Perfect.</v>

882
00:25:34.401 --> 00:25:34.701
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

883
00:25:34.701 --> 00:25:35.451
<v Speaker 4>But what about people?</v>

884
00:25:35.451 --> 00:25:37.100
<v Speaker 4>That's what environmental factors,</v>

885
00:25:37.101 --> 00:25:37.401
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

886
00:25:37.401 --> 00:25:38.720
<v Speaker 4>exposure to radiation.</v>

887
00:25:39.620 --> 00:25:40.550
<v Speaker 4>Why are you there?</v>

888
00:25:40.580 --> 00:25:41.710
<v Speaker 4>You are there because you,</v>

889
00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:44.000
<v Speaker 4>you major in again is not about blame,</v>

890
00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:44.360
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

891
00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:45.290
<v Speaker 4>It's this is,</v>

892
00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:46.880
<v Speaker 4>you chose this when,</v>

893
00:25:47.030 --> 00:25:50.540
<v Speaker 4>when you were just an angel or a spirit of what everyone calls you believe they</v>

894
00:25:50.541 --> 00:25:51.050
<v Speaker 4>chose,</v>

895
00:25:51.050 --> 00:25:52.750
<v Speaker 4>chose this life when?</v>

896
00:25:52.940 --> 00:25:54.050
<v Speaker 4>From another dimension.</v>

897
00:25:54.090 --> 00:25:54.923
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

898
00:25:55.010 --> 00:25:55.843
<v Speaker 4>When you've been there.</v>

899
00:25:56.030 --> 00:25:56.670
<v Speaker 4>I wash,</v>

900
00:25:56.670 --> 00:25:57.680
<v Speaker 4>I wonder.</v>

901
00:25:57.980 --> 00:25:58.813
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

902
00:25:58.940 --> 00:25:59.990
<v Speaker 4>I have and I haven't,</v>

903
00:26:00.020 --> 00:26:00.853
<v Speaker 4>you know what I'm saying?</v>

904
00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:01.341
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

905
00:26:01.341 --> 00:26:01.670
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

906
00:26:01.670 --> 00:26:02.420
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

907
00:26:02.420 --> 00:26:05.810
<v Speaker 4>the ideas from the psychedelic experience.</v>

908
00:26:06.270 --> 00:26:07.103
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

909
00:26:07.460 --> 00:26:09.290
<v Speaker 4>The ideas are very intoxicating.</v>

910
00:26:09.620 --> 00:26:10.453
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

911
00:26:10.780 --> 00:26:11.613
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

912
00:26:11.990 --> 00:26:16.460
<v Speaker 4>I wonder how much of it is correct when it comes to things along those lines.</v>

913
00:26:16.461 --> 00:26:18.200
<v Speaker 4>Like you choosing your own destiny,</v>

914
00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:21.480
<v Speaker 3>try letting go of the fear,</v>

915
00:26:22.140 --> 00:26:23.310
<v Speaker 3>try believing it.</v>

916
00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:25.380
<v Speaker 3>Tribal leaving it just once for one day.</v>

917
00:26:25.410 --> 00:26:25.591
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

918
00:26:25.591 --> 00:26:26.430
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't believe it,</v>

919
00:26:26.950 --> 00:26:27.221
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

920
00:26:27.221 --> 00:26:28.054
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

921
00:26:28.210 --> 00:26:30.370
<v Speaker 4>I mean I could discipline leave it to,</v>

922
00:26:30.490 --> 00:26:30.761
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

923
00:26:30.761 --> 00:26:31.200
<v Speaker 4>I could do it.</v>

924
00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:32.840
<v Speaker 4>So it can be whatever.</v>

925
00:26:32.850 --> 00:26:33.340
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

926
00:26:33.340 --> 00:26:34.180
<v Speaker 4>I mean you can,</v>

927
00:26:34.210 --> 00:26:35.260
<v Speaker 4>in that sense,</v>

928
00:26:35.290 --> 00:26:36.880
<v Speaker 4>if you believe something like that,</v>

929
00:26:36.881 --> 00:26:39.230
<v Speaker 4>I really can sort of create a reality for you.</v>

930
00:26:39.490 --> 00:26:41.430
<v Speaker 4>Absolute powering that.</v>

931
00:26:41.580 --> 00:26:42.370
<v Speaker 4>That's the,</v>

932
00:26:42.370 --> 00:26:43.203
<v Speaker 4>and that was my,</v>

933
00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:44.640
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to choose</v>

934
00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:46.300
<v Speaker 3>to walk like this ever.</v>

935
00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:47.041
<v Speaker 3>And it's not easy.</v>

936
00:26:47.041 --> 00:26:47.431
<v Speaker 3>Believe me.</v>

937
00:26:47.431 --> 00:26:49.500
<v Speaker 3>Everything in a real reality you want to say.</v>

938
00:26:49.501 --> 00:26:49.800
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

939
00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:50.581
<v Speaker 3>Well except for that,</v>

940
00:26:50.581 --> 00:26:52.620
<v Speaker 3>cause that just happened to me and I'm just blaming that.</v>

941
00:26:52.670 --> 00:26:53.170
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

942
00:26:53.170 --> 00:26:53.560
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>

943
00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:53.980
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>

944
00:26:53.980 --> 00:26:56.980
<v Speaker 1>I would really look at it that way if it wasn't for a massive environmental</v>

945
00:26:56.981 --> 00:26:57.814
<v Speaker 1>issues,</v>

946
00:26:58.200 --> 00:26:58.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

947
00:26:58.640 --> 00:26:58.990
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

948
00:26:58.990 --> 00:27:00.100
<v Speaker 1>toxic issues,</v>

949
00:27:00.101 --> 00:27:04.150
<v Speaker 1>things along those lines where people clearly like a whole town gets cancer</v>

950
00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:06.760
<v Speaker 1>because it was a fucking factor in your bar and they're throwing some shit in a</v>

951
00:27:06.761 --> 00:27:08.080
<v Speaker 1>lake and people don't know about it.</v>

952
00:27:08.930 --> 00:27:10.610
<v Speaker 3>Now go beyond that story,</v>

953
00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:14.330
<v Speaker 3>go there and 10 years and find out whose life was made better,</v>

954
00:27:14.450 --> 00:27:15.710
<v Speaker 3>whose life was changed,</v>

955
00:27:15.980 --> 00:27:16.880
<v Speaker 3>what happened.</v>

956
00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:19.610
<v Speaker 3>There's everything happens for a reason.</v>

957
00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:22.730
<v Speaker 3>So you think you like a deterministic,</v>

958
00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:24.290
<v Speaker 3>deterministic person.</v>

959
00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:29.150
<v Speaker 3>What you believe that the world is moves in a way that you cannot control?</v>

960
00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:29.810
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

961
00:27:29.810 --> 00:27:30.110
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

962
00:27:30.110 --> 00:27:30.943
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>

963
00:27:31.220 --> 00:27:31.581
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

964
00:27:31.581 --> 00:27:31.761
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

965
00:27:31.761 --> 00:27:33.380
<v Speaker 3>it's slippery because no,</v>

966
00:27:33.381 --> 00:27:34.760
<v Speaker 3>I don't believe I'm not a fatalist.</v>

967
00:27:35.330 --> 00:27:40.330
<v Speaker 3>I believe each and every one of us controls our own reality every single day</v>

968
00:27:44.510 --> 00:27:47.600
<v Speaker 3>through every choice we make the choice of,</v>

969
00:27:47.870 --> 00:27:48.200
<v Speaker 3>of what?</v>

970
00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:48.500
<v Speaker 3>Eat,</v>

971
00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:49.820
<v Speaker 3>what to think,</v>

972
00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:51.673
<v Speaker 3>how to feel.</v>

973
00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:53.960
<v Speaker 3>A lot of us think we don't have a choice in how to feel.</v>

974
00:27:53.990 --> 00:27:54.760
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

975
00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:55.880
<v Speaker 3>you hurt me so I'm angry.</v>

976
00:27:55.881 --> 00:27:56.121
<v Speaker 3>What do you,</v>

977
00:27:56.121 --> 00:27:56.954
<v Speaker 3>I don't have a choice.</v>

978
00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:57.980
<v Speaker 3>You do.</v>

979
00:27:57.980 --> 00:27:59.210
<v Speaker 3>Everything is choice.</v>

980
00:27:59.660 --> 00:28:00.493
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>

981
00:28:00.590 --> 00:28:01.010
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

982
00:28:01.010 --> 00:28:02.930
<v Speaker 3>throw some spirituality on it and you get the,</v>

983
00:28:02.990 --> 00:28:04.790
<v Speaker 3>everything's a choice just between love and fear.</v>

984
00:28:04.970 --> 00:28:08.120
<v Speaker 3>And if you break it down that small into every breath,</v>

985
00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:09.230
<v Speaker 3>it's like a practice.</v>

986
00:28:09.231 --> 00:28:14.231
<v Speaker 3>That's why the monks go live on the hill and all alone so that they can get to</v>

987
00:28:14.391 --> 00:28:17.000
<v Speaker 3>this perfect place of nut.</v>

988
00:28:17.001 --> 00:28:17.834
<v Speaker 3>Neither blame.</v>

989
00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:19.400
<v Speaker 3>You're not a judge and you're not a victim,</v>

990
00:28:19.580 --> 00:28:20.600
<v Speaker 3>you're just right in there.</v>

991
00:28:20.601 --> 00:28:21.434
<v Speaker 3>In the middle.</v>

992
00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:21.961
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

993
00:28:21.961 --> 00:28:24.840
<v Speaker 1>The monks essentially give up all civilization,</v>

994
00:28:25.150 --> 00:28:26.790
<v Speaker 1>give up life entirely.</v>

995
00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:27.653
<v Speaker 1>No sex,</v>

996
00:28:27.930 --> 00:28:28.763
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

997
00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:30.420
<v Speaker 1>I would not want to do that at all.</v>

998
00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:34.350
<v Speaker 1>And I believe you can do that in this life as you were referring to earlier.</v>

999
00:28:34.351 --> 00:28:35.040
<v Speaker 1>Balance.</v>

1000
00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:35.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1001
00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:35.770
<v Speaker 1>To,</v>

1002
00:28:35.770 --> 00:28:36.960
<v Speaker 1>to joy at all.</v>

1003
00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:37.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1004
00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:38.910
<v Speaker 1>I've always felt like monks are pussies.</v>

1005
00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:41.040
<v Speaker 1>You can't handle it really.</v>

1006
00:28:41.070 --> 00:28:44.130
<v Speaker 1>I know relationships are tough but wasn't relationships.</v>

1007
00:28:44.310 --> 00:28:46.680
<v Speaker 1>All of the best music comes from relationships.</v>

1008
00:28:46.860 --> 00:28:47.131
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

1009
00:28:47.131 --> 00:28:47.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

1010
00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:48.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm living proof.</v>

1011
00:28:48.420 --> 00:28:48.691
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1012
00:28:48.691 --> 00:28:49.021
<v Speaker 1>Moss.</v>

1013
00:28:49.021 --> 00:28:49.510
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1014
00:28:49.510 --> 00:28:51.840
<v Speaker 1>So go back and listen to like the greatest songs of all time.</v>

1015
00:28:52.050 --> 00:28:53.250
<v Speaker 1>It's always a guy and a girl,</v>

1016
00:28:53.251 --> 00:28:54.450
<v Speaker 1>like talking about some shit.</v>

1017
00:28:56.730 --> 00:28:58.260
<v Speaker 1>We thought we'd be together forever.</v>

1018
00:28:59.150 --> 00:28:59.880
<v Speaker 1>Those,</v>

1019
00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:00.121
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1020
00:29:00.121 --> 00:29:00.331
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1021
00:29:00.331 --> 00:29:01.081
<v Speaker 1>if it wasn't for that,</v>

1022
00:29:01.081 --> 00:29:02.670
<v Speaker 1>where would the other beautiful art come from?</v>

1023
00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:05.130
<v Speaker 1>There's a yin and a Yang to this crazy life.</v>

1024
00:29:05.310 --> 00:29:06.001
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>

1025
00:29:06.001 --> 00:29:07.620
<v Speaker 3>And when you can hold on to that,</v>

1026
00:29:07.860 --> 00:29:11.250
<v Speaker 3>they neither going into all the fear nor all the love.</v>

1027
00:29:11.580 --> 00:29:13.560
<v Speaker 3>I'm not all airy fairy.</v>

1028
00:29:14.070 --> 00:29:17.130
<v Speaker 3>If you can hold that middle life gets really cool.</v>

1029
00:29:17.850 --> 00:29:18.241
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1030
00:29:18.241 --> 00:29:19.470
<v Speaker 3>If you can hold that metal,</v>

1031
00:29:20.100 --> 00:29:21.620
<v Speaker 3>how do you go about holding that metal?</v>

1032
00:29:21.670 --> 00:29:23.280
<v Speaker 3>Do you every single day he just,</v>

1033
00:29:23.340 --> 00:29:24.001
<v Speaker 3>it's a practice.</v>

1034
00:29:24.001 --> 00:29:24.690
<v Speaker 3>It's a practice.</v>

1035
00:29:24.690 --> 00:29:25.200
<v Speaker 3>You don't,</v>

1036
00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:25.830
<v Speaker 3>you just,</v>

1037
00:29:25.830 --> 00:29:26.461
<v Speaker 3>you stay in the,</v>

1038
00:29:26.461 --> 00:29:30.210
<v Speaker 3>now did your personality change when this happened?</v>

1039
00:29:31.140 --> 00:29:31.860
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1040
00:29:31.860 --> 00:29:35.220
<v Speaker 3>in a way I let go a lot of personality reactions.</v>

1041
00:29:35.221 --> 00:29:38.640
<v Speaker 3>I believe that you call up who,</v>

1042
00:29:38.870 --> 00:29:39.240
<v Speaker 3>who,</v>

1043
00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:40.073
<v Speaker 3>who is going to be,</v>

1044
00:29:40.140 --> 00:29:42.690
<v Speaker 3>who's sitting here today across the table at you.</v>

1045
00:29:42.691 --> 00:29:44.460
<v Speaker 3>I'm choosing who gets to answer this.</v>

1046
00:29:44.730 --> 00:29:49.230
<v Speaker 3>I would like a 51 year old Melissa to answer you.</v>

1047
00:29:49.290 --> 00:29:50.550
<v Speaker 3>Not 14 year old,</v>

1048
00:29:50.551 --> 00:29:51.750
<v Speaker 3>14 year old has answered,</v>

1049
00:29:51.810 --> 00:29:52.230
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1050
00:29:52.230 --> 00:29:53.280
<v Speaker 3>in my relationships,</v>

1051
00:29:53.281 --> 00:29:54.091
<v Speaker 3>14 year old Melissa,</v>

1052
00:29:54.091 --> 00:29:58.890
<v Speaker 3>she comes out and she said some pretty naughty things and that's who I can</v>

1053
00:29:58.891 --> 00:30:00.570
<v Speaker 3>choose how to do it.</v>

1054
00:30:00.571 --> 00:30:00.841
<v Speaker 3>So it's,</v>

1055
00:30:00.841 --> 00:30:03.960
<v Speaker 3>it's this choice every day how I do it.</v>

1056
00:30:04.950 --> 00:30:05.221
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1057
00:30:05.221 --> 00:30:08.520
<v Speaker 1>That's a weird thing where we sort of get stuck in those young patterns.</v>

1058
00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:09.331
<v Speaker 1>The patterns are,</v>

1059
00:30:09.331 --> 00:30:09.571
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1060
00:30:09.571 --> 00:30:10.680
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people do though.</v>

1061
00:30:10.681 --> 00:30:11.080
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1062
00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:11.641
<v Speaker 1>it's really,</v>

1063
00:30:11.641 --> 00:30:12.231
<v Speaker 1>really common.</v>

1064
00:30:12.231 --> 00:30:12.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1065
00:30:12.310 --> 00:30:13.120
<v Speaker 3>Every day I do,</v>

1066
00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:13.953
<v Speaker 3>every day,</v>

1067
00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:15.680
<v Speaker 3>I'm looking at it right now.</v>

1068
00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:16.553
<v Speaker 3>Oh No.</v>

1069
00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:17.740
<v Speaker 3>That's how he always does it.</v>

1070
00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:19.510
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1071
00:30:19.510 --> 00:30:20.343
<v Speaker 1>you got to,</v>

1072
00:30:20.530 --> 00:30:25.240
<v Speaker 1>it's finding out how to manage your life is probably one of the most difficult</v>

1073
00:30:25.241 --> 00:30:30.241
<v Speaker 1>things that the person can accomplish in their life or attempt to accomplish,</v>

1074
00:30:30.380 --> 00:30:30.880
<v Speaker 1>I should say.</v>

1075
00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:32.920
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that what it's all about?</v>

1076
00:30:32.921 --> 00:30:33.280
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

1077
00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:34.120
<v Speaker 3>that's where I want to,</v>

1078
00:30:34.150 --> 00:30:34.931
<v Speaker 3>I want to come to you.</v>

1079
00:30:34.931 --> 00:30:36.160
<v Speaker 3>I want to come to listeners.</v>

1080
00:30:36.430 --> 00:30:39.190
<v Speaker 3>Everyone as a person who I achieve my goal.</v>

1081
00:30:39.580 --> 00:30:39.941
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

1082
00:30:39.941 --> 00:30:40.420
<v Speaker 3>I was born,</v>

1083
00:30:40.420 --> 00:30:41.260
<v Speaker 3>I set out,</v>

1084
00:30:41.590 --> 00:30:42.550
<v Speaker 3>I was in born in Leavenworth,</v>

1085
00:30:42.551 --> 00:30:43.384
<v Speaker 3>Kansas.</v>

1086
00:30:43.540 --> 00:30:44.620
<v Speaker 3>I wanted to be a rockstar.</v>

1087
00:30:45.070 --> 00:30:46.080
<v Speaker 3>I ought to be rockstar.</v>

1088
00:30:46.420 --> 00:30:47.680
<v Speaker 3>I wanted to meet Bruce Springsteen.</v>

1089
00:30:47.830 --> 00:30:48.860
<v Speaker 3>I got to meet Bruce based.</v>

1090
00:30:48.861 --> 00:30:49.640
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

1091
00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:52.510
<v Speaker 3>it's like those dreams came true.</v>

1092
00:30:52.630 --> 00:30:52.811
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1093
00:30:52.811 --> 00:30:56.260
<v Speaker 3>there's something that happens after those dreams come true.</v>

1094
00:30:56.650 --> 00:30:57.190
<v Speaker 3>You realize,</v>

1095
00:30:57.190 --> 00:30:58.023
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1096
00:30:58.150 --> 00:30:58.901
<v Speaker 3>I'm still me.</v>

1097
00:30:58.901 --> 00:30:59.950
<v Speaker 3>I still have all my problems.</v>

1098
00:30:59.951 --> 00:31:04.951
<v Speaker 3>I'm still so where someone who might hold that big dream and think,</v>

1099
00:31:06.701 --> 00:31:06.851
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1100
00:31:06.851 --> 00:31:07.511
<v Speaker 3>I'll never get it.</v>

1101
00:31:07.511 --> 00:31:11.200
<v Speaker 3>And so they just hold it out there and then they have lots of excuses.</v>

1102
00:31:11.201 --> 00:31:11.561
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1103
00:31:11.561 --> 00:31:12.520
<v Speaker 3>if I got that,</v>

1104
00:31:12.521 --> 00:31:13.181
<v Speaker 3>then I'd be there,</v>

1105
00:31:13.181 --> 00:31:14.020
<v Speaker 3>but I'm not,</v>

1106
00:31:14.110 --> 00:31:14.411
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1107
00:31:14.411 --> 00:31:14.521
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1108
00:31:14.521 --> 00:31:15.400
<v Speaker 3>I'd have enough money.</v>

1109
00:31:15.401 --> 00:31:16.870
<v Speaker 3>I'd have enough this or that.</v>

1110
00:31:17.410 --> 00:31:19.150
<v Speaker 3>Then you can get caught in the,</v>

1111
00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:22.780
<v Speaker 3>the turmoil of life and always believed that,</v>

1112
00:31:22.781 --> 00:31:22.961
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1113
00:31:22.961 --> 00:31:25.390
<v Speaker 3>if I was famous or if I had more money,</v>

1114
00:31:25.391 --> 00:31:27.850
<v Speaker 3>I'd be better while I'm here to tell you that the fame of the money,</v>

1115
00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:28.630
<v Speaker 3>it's nice.</v>

1116
00:31:28.630 --> 00:31:29.351
<v Speaker 3>I'll absolutely,</v>

1117
00:31:29.351 --> 00:31:32.710
<v Speaker 3>I love not having to wait in line.</v>

1118
00:31:32.740 --> 00:31:33.071
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1119
00:31:33.071 --> 00:31:33.904
<v Speaker 3>it's right.</v>

1120
00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:36.700
<v Speaker 3>Yet it does not solve all my</v>

1121
00:31:36.770 --> 00:31:39.890
<v Speaker 1>problems and it can cloud you in a little bit of confusion.</v>

1122
00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:40.131
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1123
00:31:40.131 --> 00:31:40.980
<v Speaker 1>we see that every day.</v>

1124
00:31:41.330 --> 00:31:46.010
<v Speaker 1>We've all met famous people or seeing people wig out up in certain ways.</v>

1125
00:31:46.011 --> 00:31:46.431
<v Speaker 1>We are like,</v>

1126
00:31:46.431 --> 00:31:46.791
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1127
00:31:46.791 --> 00:31:47.170
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

1128
00:31:47.170 --> 00:31:50.240
<v Speaker 1>you're being like a child throwing like a child's Tantrum.</v>

1129
00:31:50.410 --> 00:31:50.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1130
00:31:50.780 --> 00:31:53.750
<v Speaker 1>Because they're making choices to let the child still do that.</v>

1131
00:31:53.990 --> 00:31:54.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1132
00:31:54.350 --> 00:31:55.880
<v Speaker 1>And there's a weird imbalance.</v>

1133
00:31:55.910 --> 00:31:57.020
<v Speaker 1>There's a certain type,</v>

1134
00:31:57.050 --> 00:31:58.520
<v Speaker 1>there's a one type of celebrity.</v>

1135
00:31:58.610 --> 00:31:59.271
<v Speaker 1>The I told you,</v>

1136
00:31:59.271 --> 00:32:00.980
<v Speaker 1>so celebrity and the reason why,</v>

1137
00:32:00.981 --> 00:32:01.730
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1138
00:32:01.730 --> 00:32:02.180
<v Speaker 1>why,</v>

1139
00:32:02.180 --> 00:32:02.871
<v Speaker 1>why call it that?</v>

1140
00:32:02.871 --> 00:32:06.110
<v Speaker 1>It's like they're the type that once they get famous,</v>

1141
00:32:06.260 --> 00:32:10.610
<v Speaker 1>like they feel like the whole world fucked them up until now.</v>

1142
00:32:10.790 --> 00:32:14.270
<v Speaker 1>And now that they've got the world by the balls because they're famous,</v>

1143
00:32:14.510 --> 00:32:17.120
<v Speaker 1>they just really act shitty to be evil.</v>

1144
00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:18.740
<v Speaker 1>And I've seen that,</v>

1145
00:32:18.741 --> 00:32:20.960
<v Speaker 1>that one that's a really shocking one.</v>

1146
00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:24.140
<v Speaker 3>And you put that out and what you put out comes back and yeah,</v>

1147
00:32:24.180 --> 00:32:24.481
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>

1148
00:32:24.481 --> 00:32:26.100
<v Speaker 3>just sit back and watch their,</v>

1149
00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:27.833
<v Speaker 3>their world.</v>

1150
00:32:27.870 --> 00:32:28.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1151
00:32:28.290 --> 00:32:29.123
<v Speaker 1>come down.</v>

1152
00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:29.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1153
00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:33.900
<v Speaker 1>It's hard enough getting through this life without acting like the world owes</v>

1154
00:32:33.901 --> 00:32:34.291
<v Speaker 1>you something.</v>

1155
00:32:34.291 --> 00:32:38.700
<v Speaker 1>And that's that sort of delusional thinking among successful famous people.</v>

1156
00:32:38.910 --> 00:32:39.610
<v Speaker 1>It's very,</v>

1157
00:32:39.610 --> 00:32:40.450
<v Speaker 1>very odd</v>

1158
00:32:40.870 --> 00:32:44.770
<v Speaker 4>because that's like the furthest from the vulnerability of the reality of our</v>

1159
00:32:44.771 --> 00:32:45.760
<v Speaker 4>biological life.</v>

1160
00:32:45.780 --> 00:32:46.270
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1161
00:32:46.270 --> 00:32:48.760
<v Speaker 4>But it was the dream that we were fed.</v>

<v Speaker 4>You want to make more money and buy thanks.</v>

1165
00:32:55.571 --> 00:32:57.550
<v Speaker 4>Because that's the meaning of life.</v>

1166
00:32:57.880 --> 00:32:59.230
<v Speaker 4>That's how you show your successful.</v>

1167

1169
00:33:01.300 --> 00:33:02.410
<v Speaker 4>Not like health,</v>

1170
00:33:02.411 --> 00:33:03.880
<v Speaker 4>not no happiness,</v>

1171
00:33:03.881 --> 00:33:04.714

<v Speaker 4>Miles per hour is probably very important.</v>

1182
00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:11.490
<v Speaker 4>I never thought of it like that,</v>

1183
00:33:11.491 --> 00:33:12.340

<v Speaker 4>That's funny how people who can't fix themselves.</v>

1205
00:33:50.870 --> 00:33:52.550
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of those.</v>

1207
00:33:53.901 --> 00:33:56.240
<v Speaker 4>There's a whole lot of that and married to view those.</v>

1208
00:33:56.420 --> 00:33:57.520
<v Speaker 4>Those people are crazy.</v>

1209
00:33:57.940 --> 00:33:59.150
<v Speaker 4>They'll tell you what to do and you're like,</v>

00:33:59.931 --> 00:34:00.280
<v Speaker 4>bitch,</v>

00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:01.113
<v Speaker 4>you're</v>

1214
00:34:04.820 --> 00:34:06.470
<v Speaker 4>not happy and you're giving advice.</v>

1215
00:34:07.190 --> 00:34:10.310
<v Speaker 4>Once I realized I cannot fix anybody else,</v>

1216
00:34:10.490 --> 00:34:11.150
<v Speaker 4>no one else.</v>

1217
00:34:11.150 --> 00:34:11.983
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1218
00:34:12.170 --> 00:34:14.900
<v Speaker 4>I became much happier person myself.</v>

1219
00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:16.130
<v Speaker 4>You can't fix them,</v>

1220
00:34:16.131 --> 00:34:21.131
<v Speaker 4>but you can rock their world with a song that changes the way they feel about</v>

1221
00:34:22.011 --> 00:34:26.750
<v Speaker 4>life and if even if only like for a three or four minute song,</v>

1222
00:34:26.751 --> 00:34:28.340
<v Speaker 4>even if it's only for the three or four minutes,</v>

1223
00:34:28.640 --> 00:34:32.130
<v Speaker 4>but the positive reaction that someone can get for something like that,</v>

1224
00:34:32.150 --> 00:34:34.460
<v Speaker 4>is that going to affect their choices?</v>

1225
00:34:34.700 --> 00:34:35.481
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>

1226
00:34:35.481 --> 00:34:36.710

1230
00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:42.920
<v Speaker 4>do you ever have jobs like regular jobs back in the day,</v>

1281
00:36:18.630 --> 00:36:21.270
<v Speaker 4>industry 100 years ago,</v>

<v Speaker 4>when it first started,</v>

1283
00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:26.100
<v Speaker 4>had a lot of waste that they needed to get rid of.</v>

00:36:36.570 --> 00:36:38.010
<v Speaker 4>it was thought to use.</v>

1288

<v Speaker 4>but stinky people,</v>

00:36:57.360 --> 00:36:58.440
<v Speaker 4>you should know your stinky,</v>

1306
00:37:00.060 --> 00:37:01.020
<v Speaker 4>stinky hippies.</v>

1307
00:37:01.021 --> 00:37:02.100
<v Speaker 4>You fucking lazy.</v>

1308
00:37:02.101 --> 00:37:02.551
<v Speaker 4>Bitches.</v>

1309
00:37:02.551 --> 00:37:03.384
<v Speaker 4>Get up,</v>

1310
00:37:03.450 --> 00:37:03.811
<v Speaker 4>get up,</v>

1311
00:37:03.811 --> 00:37:05.460
<v Speaker 4>go run water.</v>

1312
00:37:05.730 --> 00:37:08.370
<v Speaker 4>Water is everywhere and soap is not expensive.</v>

1313
00:37:08.430 --> 00:37:09.263
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1314
00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:12.030
<v Speaker 4>Go get craft and you can use defense soap.</v>

1315
00:37:12.060 --> 00:37:12.930
<v Speaker 4>It's natural.</v>

1316
00:37:13.020 --> 00:37:13.470
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1317
00:37:13.470 --> 00:37:18.470
<v Speaker 4>So it's a great soap that has like tea tree oil in it and eucalyptus oil.</v>

1318
00:37:18.601 --> 00:37:19.411
<v Speaker 4>It's all natural.</v>

1319
00:37:19.411 --> 00:37:19.961
<v Speaker 4>It's good.</v>

1320
00:37:19.961 --> 00:37:20.970
<v Speaker 4>It's good for the skin.</v>

1321
00:37:21.180 --> 00:37:21.990
<v Speaker 4>Keeps good.</v>

1322
00:37:21.990 --> 00:37:23.940
<v Speaker 4>It keeps you from getting like ringworm and stuff like that.</v>

1323
00:37:24.860 --> 00:37:26.760
<v Speaker 4>Are you talking to someone specifically?</v>

1324
00:37:26.820 --> 00:37:27.091
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1325
00:37:27.091 --> 00:37:27.924
<v Speaker 4>unfortunately.</v>

1326
00:37:27.990 --> 00:37:32.990
<v Speaker 4>Grapplers anyone who practices Jujitsu has to deal with ringworm whirl.</v>

1327
00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:34.520
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

1328
00:37:34.520 --> 00:37:34.740
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1329
00:37:34.740 --> 00:37:35.191
<v Speaker 4>it's really,</v>

1330
00:37:35.191 --> 00:37:36.090
<v Speaker 4>really common as well.</v>

1331
00:37:36.100 --> 00:37:36.820
<v Speaker 4>Staff,</v>

1332
00:37:36.820 --> 00:37:38.420
<v Speaker 4>you can get staph infections too.</v>

1333
00:37:39.510 --> 00:37:41.220
<v Speaker 4>I've had ringworm a couple of times.</v>

1334
00:37:41.240 --> 00:37:42.850
<v Speaker 4>I've had staff twice.</v>

1335
00:37:42.990 --> 00:37:43.810
<v Speaker 4>Jeez.</v>

1336
00:37:43.810 --> 00:37:44.643
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1337
00:37:44.910 --> 00:37:46.200
<v Speaker 4>Once I caught it really early.</v>

1338
00:37:46.201 --> 00:37:47.430
<v Speaker 4>So I didn't have to get about x.</v>

1339
00:37:47.431 --> 00:37:48.264
<v Speaker 4>It took like a</v>

1340
00:37:49.500 --> 00:37:50.041
<v Speaker 4>topical,</v>

1341
00:37:50.041 --> 00:37:51.510
<v Speaker 4>but once it got pretty bad,</v>

1342
00:37:52.170 --> 00:37:53.003
<v Speaker 4>it was weird.</v>

1343
00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:58.040
<v Speaker 4>I had to take these super strong antibiotics like careful cause that if you look</v>

1344
00:37:58.561 --> 00:37:59.310
<v Speaker 4>at people's,</v>

1345
00:37:59.310 --> 00:38:00.810
<v Speaker 4>I believe my cancer started with,</v>

1346
00:38:01.110 --> 00:38:02.850
<v Speaker 4>I took these super duper antibiotics.</v>

1347
00:38:02.851 --> 00:38:04.140
<v Speaker 4>It's actually the stuff,</v>

1348
00:38:04.610 --> 00:38:05.443
<v Speaker 4>accutane.</v>

1349
00:38:05.580 --> 00:38:10.580
<v Speaker 4>I had really bad acne because I was out of balance in the beginning and then I</v>

1350
00:38:10.651 --> 00:38:13.740
<v Speaker 4>took a whole bunch of like the super duper antibiotics.</v>

1351
00:38:14.190 --> 00:38:17.970
<v Speaker 4>Those also are killing everything good inside of you still don't understand</v>

1352
00:38:17.971 --> 00:38:18.151
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

1353
00:38:18.151 --> 00:38:18.440
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1354
00:38:18.440 --> 00:38:19.111
<v Speaker 4>Or people have,</v>

1355
00:38:19.111 --> 00:38:21.180
<v Speaker 4>when you do rounds and rounds of antibiotics,</v>

1356
00:38:21.181 --> 00:38:22.620
<v Speaker 4>you are really knocking yourself down.</v>

1357
00:38:22.650 --> 00:38:25.050
<v Speaker 4>If you have a diagnosis of cancer.</v>

1358
00:38:25.230 --> 00:38:26.630
<v Speaker 4>Look in your past,</v>

1359
00:38:27.150 --> 00:38:27.983
<v Speaker 4>was there a time,</v>

1360
00:38:28.010 --> 00:38:31.170
<v Speaker 4>did you do the antibiotics right for it right before it,</v>

1361
00:38:31.590 --> 00:38:34.800
<v Speaker 4>because it compromises the immune system.</v>

1362
00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:37.330
<v Speaker 4>But you have a big infection like a staff.</v>

1363
00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:38.021
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>

1364
00:38:38.021 --> 00:38:39.080
<v Speaker 4>Kind of have to do kind of.</v>

1365
00:38:39.130 --> 00:38:39.430
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1366
00:38:39.430 --> 00:38:39.971
<v Speaker 4>absolutely.</v>

1367
00:38:39.971 --> 00:38:44.620
<v Speaker 4>So now it's a matter that you do have to get the antibiotics great for.</v>

1368
00:38:44.621 --> 00:38:46.210
<v Speaker 4>Then you have to put probiotics back in here.</v>

1369
00:38:46.211 --> 00:38:51.211
<v Speaker 4>So hoadly and you have to really be aware of your acid and alkaline balance</v>

1370
00:38:52.661 --> 00:38:55.720
<v Speaker 4>inside of you because that's what keeps your immune system so a lot of green</v>

1371
00:38:55.721 --> 00:38:59.230
<v Speaker 4>leafy vegetables and fruits that acid off the list.</v>

1372
00:38:59.231 --> 00:39:00.190
<v Speaker 4>Things along those lines.</v>

1373
00:39:00.191 --> 00:39:00.850
<v Speaker 4>No gluten,</v>

1374
00:39:00.850 --> 00:39:01.683
<v Speaker 4>no sugar.</v>

1375
00:39:01.750 --> 00:39:02.583
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1376
00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:03.011
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1377
00:39:03.011 --> 00:39:03.821
<v Speaker 4>That gluten free.</v>

1378
00:39:03.821 --> 00:39:08.590
<v Speaker 4>Where the hell was that 10 years ago when I was there any gluten free food 20</v>

1379
00:39:08.591 --> 00:39:08.981
<v Speaker 4>years ago?</v>

1380
00:39:08.981 --> 00:39:09.580
<v Speaker 4>Was there any?</v>

1381
00:39:09.580 --> 00:39:09.910
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1382
00:39:09.910 --> 00:39:10.743
<v Speaker 4>hardly any.</v>

1383
00:39:10.810 --> 00:39:11.021
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1384
00:39:11.021 --> 00:39:16.021
<v Speaker 4>because in the last 20 years what has genetically modified our wheat and it's</v>

1385
00:39:16.571 --> 00:39:19.810
<v Speaker 4>become just this an edible food.</v>

1386
00:39:20.980 --> 00:39:24.540
<v Speaker 4>The real problem with that is that Lasagna is delicious and you gave some,</v>

1387
00:39:25.370 --> 00:39:26.470
<v Speaker 4>there are some good I can.</v>

1388
00:39:26.530 --> 00:39:28.490
<v Speaker 4>I can bring you a gluten free Lasagna.</v>

1389
00:39:28.520 --> 00:39:29.353
<v Speaker 4>I can do it.</v>

1390
00:39:29.510 --> 00:39:30.080
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to,</v>

1391
00:39:30.080 --> 00:39:31.790
<v Speaker 4>I had some Sunday for Superbowl.</v>

1392
00:39:31.930 --> 00:39:32.291
<v Speaker 4>I did.</v>

1393
00:39:32.291 --> 00:39:32.710
<v Speaker 4>I did.</v>

1394
00:39:32.710 --> 00:39:33.251
<v Speaker 4>Don't make me go.</v>

1395
00:39:33.251 --> 00:39:36.120
<v Speaker 4>Joey d is how you guys see paltry gluten.</v>

1396
00:39:37.620 --> 00:39:38.830
<v Speaker 4>What are you talking about people?</v>

1397
00:39:39.700 --> 00:39:40.540
<v Speaker 4>Gluten free.</v>

1398
00:39:40.541 --> 00:39:42.340
<v Speaker 4>Lasagna just seems like a mess.</v>

1399
00:39:42.910 --> 00:39:43.430
<v Speaker 4>I don't want,</v>

1400
00:39:43.430 --> 00:39:44.410
<v Speaker 4>I don't want no part of that.</v>

1401
00:39:45.130 --> 00:39:46.990
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to be pretending that I'm enjoying it.</v>

1402
00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:48.890
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to bring you some pot.</v>

1403
00:39:48.910 --> 00:39:49.990
<v Speaker 4>I'm just going to bring you some pos.</v>

1404
00:39:50.020 --> 00:39:51.460
<v Speaker 4>Isn't it a balanced I like,</v>

1405
00:39:51.730 --> 00:39:52.930
<v Speaker 4>I like regular pasta though.</v>

1406
00:39:52.931 --> 00:39:53.621
<v Speaker 4>Unfortunately.</v>

1407
00:39:53.621 --> 00:39:57.830
<v Speaker 4>I've tried eight Ezekiel Pasta and I use it because it's healthy for you.</v>

1408
00:39:57.840 --> 00:39:58.920
<v Speaker 4>A sprouted grain posts.</v>

1409
00:40:00.190 --> 00:40:00.560
<v Speaker 4>No one.</v>

1410
00:40:00.560 --> 00:40:01.240
<v Speaker 4>It is,</v>

1411
00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:01.781
<v Speaker 4>but again,</v>

1412
00:40:01.781 --> 00:40:02.201
<v Speaker 4>the taste,</v>

1413
00:40:02.201 --> 00:40:02.500
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

1414
00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:02.830
<v Speaker 4>Ooh,</v>

1415
00:40:02.830 --> 00:40:03.663
<v Speaker 4>wow.</v>

1416
00:40:04.900 --> 00:40:07.180
<v Speaker 4>You can find the balance.</v>

1417
00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:08.313
<v Speaker 4>There are,</v>

1418
00:40:08.410 --> 00:40:09.340
<v Speaker 4>they're spelt,</v>

1419
00:40:09.370 --> 00:40:12.100
<v Speaker 4>spelt is like a lesser wheat.</v>

1420
00:40:12.101 --> 00:40:14.350
<v Speaker 4>It's still a wheat and it still will fluff up.</v>

1421
00:40:14.350 --> 00:40:15.190
<v Speaker 4>You can get spelt bread.</v>

1422
00:40:15.191 --> 00:40:16.270
<v Speaker 4>That's it's pretty good.</v>

1423
00:40:16.780 --> 00:40:17.613
<v Speaker 4>I don't believe you.</v>

1424
00:40:18.460 --> 00:40:21.180

1430
00:40:27.701 --> 00:40:29.050

00:44:26.421 --> 00:44:27.254
<v Speaker 4>to stay there.</v>

1592
00:44:27.470 --> 00:44:28.550
<v Speaker 4>So that's what I think it is.</v>

1593
00:44:28.551 --> 00:44:30.370
<v Speaker 4>I think he's just obsessed with gratitude.</v>

1594
00:44:30.750 --> 00:44:31.300
<v Speaker 4>Gratitude.</v>

1595
00:44:31.300 --> 00:44:31.961
<v Speaker 4>Amazing.</v>

1596
00:44:31.961 --> 00:44:32.410
<v Speaker 4>Gratitude</v>

1597
00:44:32.410 --> 00:44:33.040
<v Speaker 1>is a medicine.</v>

1598
00:44:33.040 --> 00:44:34.420
<v Speaker 1>You can change your life with gratitude.</v>

1599
00:44:34.690 --> 00:44:35.650
<v Speaker 1>You really can write him.</v>

1600
00:44:35.651 --> 00:44:36.041
<v Speaker 1>And we,</v>

1601
00:44:36.041 --> 00:44:39.670
<v Speaker 1>and as we were saying before about people who've had sort of near death</v>

1602
00:44:39.671 --> 00:44:42.640
<v Speaker 1>experiences and became like very spiritual afterwards and really sort of</v>

1603
00:44:42.641 --> 00:44:44.210
<v Speaker 1>understood life in a,</v>

1604
00:44:44.211 --> 00:44:44.500
<v Speaker 1>in a,</v>

1605
00:44:44.500 --> 00:44:47.840
<v Speaker 1>in a broader perspective like that you are choosing to,</v>

1606
00:44:47.900 --> 00:44:49.690
<v Speaker 1>to look at life that way.</v>

1607
00:44:49.870 --> 00:44:53.260
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of difficult for people to visualize without the,</v>

1608
00:44:53.261 --> 00:44:54.940
<v Speaker 1>the real life changing experience.</v>

1609
00:44:54.941 --> 00:44:55.774
<v Speaker 1>But if you could,</v>

1610
00:44:55.890 --> 00:44:58.630
<v Speaker 1>you would see so many amazing things about life.</v>

1611
00:44:58.660 --> 00:45:00.850
<v Speaker 1>It's the whole thing is a,</v>

1612
00:45:01.120 --> 00:45:02.470
<v Speaker 1>a beautiful mystery.</v>

1613
00:45:02.500 --> 00:45:03.140
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1614
00:45:03.140 --> 00:45:03.411
<v Speaker 1>The whole,</v>

1615
00:45:03.411 --> 00:45:07.750
<v Speaker 1>to hold it with less fear than you have a less fearful life and realize that</v>

1616
00:45:07.751 --> 00:45:10.540
<v Speaker 1>that energy that you're expressing unfair,</v>

1617
00:45:10.720 --> 00:45:15.640
<v Speaker 1>you could be expressing on positive things and advancing your position in life.</v>

1618
00:45:15.700 --> 00:45:16.930
<v Speaker 1>Think your dancing.</v>

1619
00:45:17.190 --> 00:45:17.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1620
00:45:17.500 --> 00:45:21.310
<v Speaker 1>Advancing you the way you interact with people and enhancing your relationships</v>

1621
00:45:21.590 --> 00:45:25.630
<v Speaker 1>and advancing the way you approach whatever you do for a living and enhancing</v>

1622
00:45:25.631 --> 00:45:26.410
<v Speaker 1>your creativity.</v>

1623
00:45:26.410 --> 00:45:29.260
<v Speaker 3>Think of how you think about your boss or someone that you work with,</v>

1624
00:45:29.261 --> 00:45:30.520
<v Speaker 3>the energy that you spend going,</v>

1625
00:45:30.610 --> 00:45:30.821
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1626
00:45:30.821 --> 00:45:32.030
<v Speaker 3>they're such a bad,</v>

1627
00:45:32.290 --> 00:45:36.370
<v Speaker 3>remember that next time that thought pops in your head go,</v>

1628
00:45:36.700 --> 00:45:37.001
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1629
00:45:37.001 --> 00:45:37.241
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

1630
00:45:37.241 --> 00:45:37.511
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

1631
00:45:37.511 --> 00:45:38.121
<v Speaker 3>I don't feel that way,</v>

1632
00:45:38.121 --> 00:45:40.840
<v Speaker 3>but I am grateful for that job because blah,</v>

1633
00:45:40.841 --> 00:45:41.100
<v Speaker 3>blah blah,</v>

1634
00:45:41.100 --> 00:45:42.460
<v Speaker 3>or just I'm grateful.</v>

1635
00:45:42.580 --> 00:45:44.920
<v Speaker 3>If you can find something to be grateful about your boss,</v>

1636
00:45:44.921 --> 00:45:49.720
<v Speaker 3>that's even better because then you can kill that fear and turn it into love and</v>

1637
00:45:49.721 --> 00:45:50.860
<v Speaker 3>I know it's all hippy dippy,</v>

1638
00:45:51.070 --> 00:45:56.070
<v Speaker 3>but that's what creates more of that positive vibration in your life.</v>

1639
00:45:56.930 --> 00:45:57.240
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

1640
00:45:57.240 --> 00:45:58.130
<v Speaker 1>You could also do,</v>

1641
00:45:58.131 --> 00:45:59.750
<v Speaker 1>and this is very practical,</v>

1642
00:45:59.930 --> 00:46:03.410
<v Speaker 1>if you have someone in your life that you don't like and you have to work with</v>

1643
00:46:03.411 --> 00:46:04.040
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

1644
00:46:04.040 --> 00:46:06.590
<v Speaker 1>use them as an exercise,</v>

1645
00:46:07.140 --> 00:46:09.410
<v Speaker 1>an exercise in your own patients,</v>

1646
00:46:09.710 --> 00:46:14.710
<v Speaker 1>an exercise in your own ability to actually be kind to someone that is not being</v>

1647
00:46:15.141 --> 00:46:17.930
<v Speaker 1>kind to you because it gets really weird when you do that.</v>

1648
00:46:18.200 --> 00:46:21.140
<v Speaker 1>When you're kind to someone and they're not being kind to you,</v>

1649
00:46:21.280 --> 00:46:22.070
<v Speaker 1>they like,</v>

1650
00:46:22.070 --> 00:46:25.030
<v Speaker 1>they get even more aggressive sometimes and they,</v>

1651
00:46:25.050 --> 00:46:25.700
<v Speaker 1>they like,</v>

1652
00:46:25.700 --> 00:46:27.980
<v Speaker 1>they're almost like they're stuck in there,</v>

1653
00:46:28.010 --> 00:46:28.970
<v Speaker 1>they can't swim.</v>

1654
00:46:29.030 --> 00:46:31.510
<v Speaker 1>It's like it becomes this weird sort of situation.</v>

1655
00:46:31.630 --> 00:46:36.130
<v Speaker 3>Fear and pain is is an energy that people want to hook into you to release.</v>

1656
00:46:36.210 --> 00:46:36.400
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1657
00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:36.911
<v Speaker 3>There's actually,</v>

1658
00:46:36.911 --> 00:46:37.211
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

1659
00:46:37.211 --> 00:46:41.250
<v Speaker 3>you can look at it energetically that I've got this little going on.</v>

1660
00:46:41.260 --> 00:46:41.381
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1661
00:46:41.381 --> 00:46:41.860
<v Speaker 3>there's somebody,</v>

1662
00:46:41.860 --> 00:46:42.191
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1663
00:46:42.191 --> 00:46:42.651
<v Speaker 3>I can be,</v>

1664
00:46:42.651 --> 00:46:43.391
<v Speaker 3>I can give it to you.</v>

1665
00:46:43.391 --> 00:46:44.980
<v Speaker 3>And if you react,</v>

1666
00:46:44.981 --> 00:46:47.500
<v Speaker 3>if you re act what I gave you,</v>

1667
00:46:48.070 --> 00:46:48.730
<v Speaker 3>then,</v>

1668
00:46:48.730 --> 00:46:48.911
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1669
00:46:48.911 --> 00:46:49.600
<v Speaker 3>you've got it now.</v>

1670
00:46:49.600 --> 00:46:50.433
<v Speaker 3>I don't have it anymore.</v>

1671
00:46:50.950 --> 00:46:51.580
<v Speaker 3>I'm good.</v>

1672
00:46:51.580 --> 00:46:53.290
<v Speaker 3>So break that chain,</v>

1673
00:46:53.291 --> 00:46:54.250
<v Speaker 3>don't react,</v>

1674
00:46:55.240 --> 00:46:56.073
<v Speaker 3>respond,</v>

1675
00:46:56.530 --> 00:46:57.191
<v Speaker 3>look at them and go,</v>

1676
00:46:57.191 --> 00:46:57.520
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1677
00:46:57.520 --> 00:46:59.050
<v Speaker 3>where can I find gratitude and love here?</v>

1678
00:46:59.051 --> 00:46:59.681
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>

1679
00:46:59.681 --> 00:47:00.430
<v Speaker 3>I'm just going to,</v>

1680
00:47:00.430 --> 00:47:00.731
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>

1681
00:47:00.731 --> 00:47:02.650
<v Speaker 3>You've got a lovely tie and just move on.</v>

1682
00:47:02.890 --> 00:47:03.250
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1683
00:47:03.250 --> 00:47:04.150
<v Speaker 1>For some people though,</v>

1684
00:47:04.151 --> 00:47:08.320
<v Speaker 1>they're always at like a seven or an eight on a scale of one to 10 with being</v>

1685
00:47:08.321 --> 00:47:09.960
<v Speaker 1>upset at things cause they,</v>

1686
00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:10.960
<v Speaker 1>they're sort of this,</v>

1687
00:47:11.680 --> 00:47:16.680
<v Speaker 1>this almost momentum of chaos in their life from jobs to relationship to this,</v>

1688
00:47:16.961 --> 00:47:17.940
<v Speaker 1>to that they,</v>

1689
00:47:18.160 --> 00:47:20.680
<v Speaker 1>they never have this moment where they can just</v>

1690
00:47:20.750 --> 00:47:21.583
<v Speaker 3>stop.</v>

1691
00:47:22.310 --> 00:47:22.461
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1692
00:47:22.461 --> 00:47:23.294
<v Speaker 3>here's one.</v>

1693
00:47:24.740 --> 00:47:29.740
<v Speaker 3>When you start practicing living your life intentionally understanding that it</v>

1694
00:47:32.531 --> 00:47:33.610
<v Speaker 3>is all vibrational,</v>

1695
00:47:34.300 --> 00:47:39.300
<v Speaker 3>then you start understanding that the people that come into your life are all</v>

1696
00:47:39.491 --> 00:47:40.750
<v Speaker 3>part of your vibration.</v>

1697
00:47:40.751 --> 00:47:44.680
<v Speaker 3>So if there's someone in your life who is always on to seven and eight and</v>

1698
00:47:44.681 --> 00:47:46.330
<v Speaker 3>bringing it and losing it and all that,</v>

1699
00:47:46.900 --> 00:47:49.660
<v Speaker 3>that's part of you and the only thing you can do,</v>

1700
00:47:49.661 --> 00:47:50.471
<v Speaker 3>you can't change them,</v>

1701
00:47:50.471 --> 00:47:51.760
<v Speaker 3>but you can go inside yourself and go,</v>

1702
00:47:51.761 --> 00:47:51.941
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1703
00:47:51.941 --> 00:47:55.000
<v Speaker 3>where's the part of me that's afraid of that?</v>

1704
00:47:55.001 --> 00:47:58.210
<v Speaker 3>I'm over the top and then I'm losing it and then I end and you go in and heal</v>

1705
00:47:58.211 --> 00:48:03.040
<v Speaker 3>that and then that person will disappear or they will change,</v>

1706
00:48:03.700 --> 00:48:07.360
<v Speaker 3>and I've done this for eight years now and I can say that that is exactly what</v>

1707
00:48:07.361 --> 00:48:07.660
<v Speaker 3>happens.</v>

1708
00:48:07.660 --> 00:48:08.830
<v Speaker 3>How do you explain stalkers?</v>

1709
00:48:09.730 --> 00:48:10.563
<v Speaker 3>I don't have any.</v>

1710
00:48:10.960 --> 00:48:11.820
<v Speaker 3>You don't have any,</v>

1711
00:48:11.830 --> 00:48:14.350
<v Speaker 3>but other people do because it's a sphere.</v>

1712
00:48:14.380 --> 00:48:16.270
<v Speaker 3>You manifest it as a fear.</v>

1713
00:48:16.630 --> 00:48:17.000
<v Speaker 3>It is.</v>

1714
00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:21.670
<v Speaker 3>You are afraid that as as sexual as you're being in a photograph or in a movie</v>

1715
00:48:21.671 --> 00:48:22.390
<v Speaker 3>or something,</v>

1716
00:48:22.390 --> 00:48:25.760
<v Speaker 3>that someone's going to take that and that's going to end,</v>

1717
00:48:25.780 --> 00:48:27.310
<v Speaker 3>take it wrong and come back and hurt you.</v>

1718
00:48:27.340 --> 00:48:28.173
<v Speaker 3>It's a fear</v>

1719
00:48:28.530 --> 00:48:29.363
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

1720
00:48:29.430 --> 00:48:34.080
<v Speaker 1>that becomes very hippy dippy when you're dealing with the reality of actual</v>

1721
00:48:34.110 --> 00:48:35.730
<v Speaker 1>people actually being victimized.</v>

1722
00:48:35.870 --> 00:48:38.930
<v Speaker 3>Just depends on what your definition of reality is.</v>

1723
00:48:39.350 --> 00:48:40.183
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1724
00:48:40.880 --> 00:48:44.120
<v Speaker 3>You're really putting yourself out there and I know I can only do it here.</v>

1725
00:48:44.820 --> 00:48:45.040
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1726
00:48:45.040 --> 00:48:48.900
<v Speaker 1>it's such a weird way of looking at the world and a lot of people think that</v>

1727
00:48:48.901 --> 00:48:50.490
<v Speaker 1>that strange,</v>

1728
00:48:50.550 --> 00:48:51.990
<v Speaker 1>although nonjudgmental,</v>

1729
00:48:52.050 --> 00:48:53.970
<v Speaker 1>very non judgemental way of,</v>

1730
00:48:54.030 --> 00:48:55.170
<v Speaker 1>of looking at the world,</v>

1731
00:48:55.800 --> 00:48:57.900
<v Speaker 1>it's almost akin to like the secret</v>

1732
00:48:57.980 --> 00:48:59.100
<v Speaker 3>like that kind of thinking.</v>

1733
00:48:59.360 --> 00:49:04.040
<v Speaker 3>The secret is like the Mcdonald's of this movement.</v>

1734
00:49:04.041 --> 00:49:07.520
<v Speaker 3>I would say I feel that a lot of people are starting to understand this on a,</v>

1735
00:49:07.540 --> 00:49:08.750
<v Speaker 3>on a very basic level.</v>

1736
00:49:08.751 --> 00:49:09.080
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1737
00:49:09.080 --> 00:49:09.441
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1738
00:49:09.441 --> 00:49:11.600
<v Speaker 3>if I just eat better,</v>

1739
00:49:11.601 --> 00:49:12.261
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to feel better.</v>

1740
00:49:12.261 --> 00:49:12.471
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1741
00:49:12.471 --> 00:49:14.270
<v Speaker 3>Food must have some sort of energy that makes me feel,</v>

1742
00:49:14.290 --> 00:49:18.770
<v Speaker 3>and you start with that and then you realize the things that do make you feel</v>

1743
00:49:18.771 --> 00:49:19.580
<v Speaker 3>better,</v>

1744
00:49:19.580 --> 00:49:20.490
<v Speaker 3>make your day better.</v>

1745
00:49:20.491 --> 00:49:20.630
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1746
00:49:20.630 --> 00:49:20.960
<v Speaker 3>and it,</v>

1747
00:49:20.960 --> 00:49:21.320
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1748
00:49:21.320 --> 00:49:22.153
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1749
00:49:22.190 --> 00:49:22.461
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

1750
00:49:22.461 --> 00:49:24.140
<v Speaker 3>it's not going to happen all in one day,</v>

1751
00:49:24.830 --> 00:49:29.830
<v Speaker 3>but it is something that is happening on a very wide scale and the,</v>

1752
00:49:30.930 --> 00:49:32.390
<v Speaker 3>it is the tipping point right now.</v>

1753
00:49:32.391 --> 00:49:33.710
<v Speaker 3>I think there's more people who,</v>

1754
00:49:33.830 --> 00:49:34.780
<v Speaker 3>I think there's people at home going home.</v>

1755
00:49:34.781 --> 00:49:35.601
<v Speaker 3>That's what I always thought,</v>

1756
00:49:35.601 --> 00:49:37.450
<v Speaker 3>but I was just too afraid to say yes,</v>

1757
00:49:37.940 --> 00:49:39.290
<v Speaker 1>I have a model of the world.</v>

1758
00:49:39.291 --> 00:49:41.960
<v Speaker 1>I think that comes from more from the media,</v>

1759
00:49:41.990 --> 00:49:46.550
<v Speaker 1>from books and movies and TV shows.</v>

1760
00:49:46.670 --> 00:49:51.290
<v Speaker 1>That's sort of our model of how life goes because we see that almost more than</v>

1761
00:49:51.291 --> 00:49:52.610
<v Speaker 1>we see our neighbors lives.</v>

1762
00:49:52.910 --> 00:49:54.590
<v Speaker 1>We see that almost more than,</v>

1763
00:49:54.610 --> 00:49:54.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1764
00:49:54.800 --> 00:49:57.230
<v Speaker 1>we see other people interact with each other and you think about how many hours</v>

1765
00:49:57.231 --> 00:50:01.010
<v Speaker 1>people in from the television watching on television shows and it's almost,</v>

1766
00:50:01.400 --> 00:50:06.350
<v Speaker 1>it becomes this very strange thing where fiction becomes almost the framework</v>

1767
00:50:06.410 --> 00:50:08.810
<v Speaker 1>for the culture and it also,</v>

1768
00:50:08.811 --> 00:50:10.070
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of like,</v>

1769
00:50:10.190 --> 00:50:14.120
<v Speaker 1>it becomes a strange issue where everyone has to wonder,</v>

1770
00:50:14.121 --> 00:50:14.381
<v Speaker 1>where's the,</v>

1771
00:50:14.381 --> 00:50:16.060
<v Speaker 1>what are the roots of all this coming from?</v>

1772
00:50:16.061 --> 00:50:16.520
<v Speaker 1>Where,</v>

1773
00:50:16.520 --> 00:50:18.410
<v Speaker 1>where's the roots of all this crazy behavior?</v>

1774
00:50:18.430 --> 00:50:20.030
<v Speaker 1>Or are we creating this ourselves?</v>

1775
00:50:20.300 --> 00:50:20.720
<v Speaker 1>Is it,</v>

1776
00:50:20.720 --> 00:50:25.720
<v Speaker 1>is our media creating this world that we can't live up to that we can't keep up</v>

1777
00:50:26.001 --> 00:50:26.720
<v Speaker 1>with and we don't?</v>

1778
00:50:26.720 --> 00:50:27.980
<v Speaker 1>The unnatural</v>

1779
00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:31.130
<v Speaker 4>interactions with each other always perfect endings.</v>

1780
00:50:31.200 --> 00:50:33.620
<v Speaker 4>The people that you're following through the whole movie never die.</v>

1781
00:50:33.621 --> 00:50:34.140
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

1782
00:50:34.140 --> 00:50:35.870
<v Speaker 4>what are you showing me here,</v>

1783
00:50:35.871 --> 00:50:36.704
<v Speaker 4>man?</v>

1784
00:50:36.710 --> 00:50:38.900
<v Speaker 4>What are you showing me that's so influential?</v>

1785
00:50:39.410 --> 00:50:41.360
<v Speaker 4>And it's they're showing it to themselves,</v>

1786
00:50:41.361 --> 00:50:43.970
<v Speaker 4>as we said about the people who were in the movies themselves.</v>

1787
00:50:43.971 --> 00:50:45.470
<v Speaker 4>It gets so crazy and delusional,</v>

1788
00:50:45.670 --> 00:50:49.280
<v Speaker 4>like they are obviously caught up in whatever the fuck that is as well.</v>

1789
00:50:50.930 --> 00:50:51.763
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

1790
00:50:51.920 --> 00:50:53.240
<v Speaker 4>And there's a lot of,</v>

1791
00:50:53.241 --> 00:50:53.850
<v Speaker 4>you can,</v>

1792
00:50:53.850 --> 00:50:55.280
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of different</v>

1793
00:50:56.720 --> 00:50:59.540
<v Speaker 4>roads of thought and you can,</v>

1794
00:50:59.541 --> 00:50:59.840
<v Speaker 4>I've,</v>

1795
00:50:59.840 --> 00:51:00.830
<v Speaker 4>I've been down the,</v>

1796
00:51:00.831 --> 00:51:01.071
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1797
00:51:01.071 --> 00:51:01.904
<v Speaker 4>the David Eick,</v>

1798
00:51:01.910 --> 00:51:03.420
<v Speaker 4>I've read all that I've gotten.</v>

1799
00:51:03.490 --> 00:51:04.323
<v Speaker 4>What do you think of that guy?</v>

1800
00:51:05.060 --> 00:51:08.300
<v Speaker 4>What's interesting is I started reading him f eight years ago and I read all</v>

1801
00:51:08.301 --> 00:51:09.134
<v Speaker 4>this stuff.</v>

1802
00:51:09.230 --> 00:51:10.063
<v Speaker 4>You read all of it.</v>

1803
00:51:10.070 --> 00:51:10.371
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>

1804
00:51:10.371 --> 00:51:10.911
<v Speaker 4>Can you believe that I,</v>

1805
00:51:10.911 --> 00:51:14.690
<v Speaker 4>I was realizing I needed to understand if I was going to change my life and I</v>

1806
00:51:14.691 --> 00:51:15.501
<v Speaker 4>wanted to live too.</v>

1807
00:51:15.501 --> 00:51:16.610
<v Speaker 4>I wanted to understand,</v>

1808
00:51:16.730 --> 00:51:20.450
<v Speaker 4>to really understand this on a very like a molecular level.</v>

1809
00:51:20.451 --> 00:51:21.350
<v Speaker 4>I want to get this.</v>

1810
00:51:21.740 --> 00:51:24.770
<v Speaker 4>So I started him and the beautiful thing was,</v>

1811
00:51:24.771 --> 00:51:25.200
<v Speaker 4>is he,</v>

1812
00:51:25.200 --> 00:51:27.320
<v Speaker 4>he deconstructed everything,</v>

1813
00:51:27.770 --> 00:51:29.600
<v Speaker 4>but doesn't he also believe in the Reptilians?</v>

1814
00:51:29.920 --> 00:51:30.753
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

1815
00:51:30.800 --> 00:51:31.633
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1816
00:51:32.890 --> 00:51:33.120
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

1817
00:51:33.120 --> 00:51:34.490
<v Speaker 4>Part of this part of it.</v>

1818
00:51:34.500 --> 00:51:34.800
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

1819
00:51:34.800 --> 00:51:35.460
<v Speaker 4>indeed.</v>

1820
00:51:35.460 --> 00:51:40.460
<v Speaker 4>Part of this whole thing is each of us is entitled to our belief and that's what</v>

1821
00:51:42.481 --> 00:51:43.314
<v Speaker 4>his belief is.</v>

1822
00:51:43.320 --> 00:51:44.490
<v Speaker 4>And that's what his belief is,</v>

1823
00:51:44.730 --> 00:51:45.860
<v Speaker 4>that they're all reptiles though.</v>

1824
00:51:45.870 --> 00:51:46.760
<v Speaker 4>But it doesn't mean he liked,</v>

1825
00:51:46.761 --> 00:51:48.090
<v Speaker 4>he's like lectures on this.</v>

1826
00:51:48.120 --> 00:51:48.391
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

1827
00:51:48.391 --> 00:51:50.010
<v Speaker 4>But he also goes past it.</v>

1828
00:51:50.070 --> 00:51:52.650
<v Speaker 4>He also goes past it and he starts talking about,</v>

1829
00:51:52.830 --> 00:51:57.830
<v Speaker 4>but in the end I understand that I am living an intentional reality and that I</v>

1830
00:51:59.431 --> 00:52:04.431
<v Speaker 4>create my reality and I have to go into an only take care of myself because the</v>

1831
00:52:05.250 --> 00:52:07.470
<v Speaker 4>enemy and he even goes hippy dippy and he gets to love.</v>

1832
00:52:07.500 --> 00:52:08.760
<v Speaker 4>He does at read his last book.</v>

1833
00:52:08.970 --> 00:52:09.151
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1834
00:52:09.151 --> 00:52:13.620
<v Speaker 4>I believe that a lot of people that have wacky ideas also can have very good</v>

1835
00:52:13.621 --> 00:52:14.310
<v Speaker 4>ideas.</v>

1836
00:52:14.310 --> 00:52:14.610
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1837
00:52:14.610 --> 00:52:14.821
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1838
00:52:14.821 --> 00:52:16.020
<v Speaker 4>I think the idea that you can,</v>

1839
00:52:16.080 --> 00:52:16.980
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's what,</v>

1840
00:52:17.490 --> 00:52:22.490
<v Speaker 4>that's the idea of taking someone's oh good work and connecting it to some bad</v>

1841
00:52:23.221 --> 00:52:25.620
<v Speaker 4>work as if it negates the good work.</v>

1842
00:52:25.860 --> 00:52:26.760
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't really,</v>

1843
00:52:27.780 --> 00:52:32.780
<v Speaker 4>I look at the world again in balance and you can't have all good and the the,</v>

1844
00:52:35.100 --> 00:52:40.100
<v Speaker 4>the issue comes when you start labeling and judging what's bad and what is evil</v>

1845
00:52:40.411 --> 00:52:44.640
<v Speaker 4>and then that's a whole nother homeboy does think that the ruling elites are</v>

1846
00:52:44.641 --> 00:52:45.600
<v Speaker 4>lizard people.</v>

1847
00:52:46.200 --> 00:52:47.370
<v Speaker 4>That is an issue.</v>

1848
00:52:48.240 --> 00:52:49.560
<v Speaker 4>That's an issue with thinking.</v>

1849
00:52:50.250 --> 00:52:51.450
<v Speaker 4>That's an issue where you got to,</v>

1850
00:52:51.460 --> 00:52:53.280
<v Speaker 4>you know what he will present you with.</v>

1851
00:52:54.090 --> 00:52:56.800
<v Speaker 4>Probably won't I Betty.</v>

1852
00:52:56.810 --> 00:52:57.310
<v Speaker 4>Whoa.</v>

1853
00:52:57.310 --> 00:52:58.050
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't that.</v>

1854
00:52:58.050 --> 00:53:01.110
<v Speaker 4>Wouldn't you love to get David I to sit down with Neil degrasse Tyson.</v>

1855
00:53:01.260 --> 00:53:05.880
<v Speaker 4>I'll have him tell him why there are not reptiles running this world.</v>

1856
00:53:08.360 --> 00:53:08.970
<v Speaker 4>He would,</v>

1857
00:53:08.970 --> 00:53:11.220
<v Speaker 4>it would it be hilarious and fascinating,</v>

1858
00:53:12.240 --> 00:53:13.530
<v Speaker 4>but that's how that's is.</v>

1859
00:53:13.620 --> 00:53:17.220
<v Speaker 4>That is a fucking crazy belief that there's all kinds of ways to look at it.</v>

1860
00:53:17.280 --> 00:53:18.113
<v Speaker 4>I believe in bigfoot.</v>

1861
00:53:18.600 --> 00:53:19.433
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1862
00:53:19.580 --> 00:53:20.910
<v Speaker 4>Not a hundred percent you can break it down.</v>

1863
00:53:20.911 --> 00:53:25.770
<v Speaker 4>You can say the reptilian ancestors of ours are actually this,</v>

1864
00:53:25.800 --> 00:53:26.850
<v Speaker 4>the whole darker side,</v>

1865
00:53:26.851 --> 00:53:27.211
<v Speaker 4>the whole,</v>

1866
00:53:27.211 --> 00:53:29.490
<v Speaker 4>we've got our it scientifically or Reptilian brain.</v>

1867
00:53:29.580 --> 00:53:30.570
<v Speaker 4>That's part of us.</v>

1868
00:53:30.571 --> 00:53:34.190
<v Speaker 4>That's the part of us that if we can imagine these horrible things that,</v>

1869
00:53:34.290 --> 00:53:35.123
<v Speaker 4>that they have done,</v>

1870
00:53:35.130 --> 00:53:37.080
<v Speaker 4>each of us has that inside of us.</v>

1871
00:53:37.110 --> 00:53:40.320
<v Speaker 4>We're actually way worse than reptiles because roadhouses kill things and eat</v>

1872
00:53:40.321 --> 00:53:40.441
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>

1873
00:53:40.441 --> 00:53:44.220
<v Speaker 4>They don't torture them and time to trucks and pull them apart from each other</v>

1874
00:53:44.221 --> 00:53:46.690
<v Speaker 4>and do all sorts of shit that you could find everyday on the Internet.</v>

1875
00:53:47.050 --> 00:53:47.420
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1876
00:53:47.420 --> 00:53:48.420
<v Speaker 4>the reptiles onto that,</v>

1877
00:53:48.480 --> 00:53:52.260
<v Speaker 4>so to call us reptilian and a lot of ways we are way cooler than reptiles.</v>

1878
00:53:52.350 --> 00:53:53.183
<v Speaker 4>First off,</v>

1879
00:53:53.280 --> 00:53:56.670
<v Speaker 4>we're capable of amazing shit the reptiles can't even fuck with.</v>

1880
00:53:57.090 --> 00:53:59.010
<v Speaker 4>But if you get past that,</v>

1881
00:53:59.040 --> 00:54:02.910
<v Speaker 4>I mean w reptiles are actually less cruel than us cause reptiles don't kill for</v>

1882
00:54:02.911 --> 00:54:03.480
<v Speaker 4>fun.</v>

1883
00:54:03.480 --> 00:54:04.380
<v Speaker 4>They kill the EU,</v>

1884
00:54:04.640 --> 00:54:05.191
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean?</v>

1885
00:54:05.191 --> 00:54:05.640
<v Speaker 4>That's the,</v>

1886
00:54:05.640 --> 00:54:08.070
<v Speaker 4>they're there just to try to get by in life and their,</v>

1887
00:54:08.071 --> 00:54:10.470
<v Speaker 4>their program to not be emotional and think about things.</v>

1888
00:54:10.471 --> 00:54:13.890
<v Speaker 4>But if your program to be emotional and think about things and you still don't</v>

1889
00:54:14.340 --> 00:54:15.240
<v Speaker 4>to act that way,</v>

1890
00:54:15.390 --> 00:54:18.630
<v Speaker 4>that's way worse than being a reptile and then horrible things are going to</v>

1891
00:54:18.631 --> 00:54:19.464
<v Speaker 4>happen to you.</v>

1892
00:54:19.620 --> 00:54:20.730
<v Speaker 4>I still hate reptiles.</v>

1893
00:54:21.070 --> 00:54:22.110
<v Speaker 4>I do not like them.</v>

1894
00:54:22.510 --> 00:54:23.343
<v Speaker 4>They're not my friends.</v>

1895
00:54:23.580 --> 00:54:26.760
<v Speaker 4>I don't trust anything that you can't train even a little.</v>

1896
00:54:29.280 --> 00:54:31.650
<v Speaker 4>He never fucking train a crocodile monitor.</v>

1897
00:54:31.980 --> 00:54:32.251
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

1898
00:54:32.251 --> 00:54:33.600
<v Speaker 4>You just keep feeding it until it's,</v>

1899
00:54:34.070 --> 00:54:34.590
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1900
00:54:34.590 --> 00:54:36.510
<v Speaker 4>to stuff so it doesn't want to bite you.</v>

1901
00:54:36.900 --> 00:54:38.280
<v Speaker 4>And they get used to handling them,</v>

1902
00:54:38.281 --> 00:54:39.270
<v Speaker 4>but they never your buddy,</v>

1903
00:54:39.271 --> 00:54:41.760
<v Speaker 4>they don't care if you fell down right in front of them.</v>

1904
00:54:41.761 --> 00:54:46.761
<v Speaker 4>They just start eating you right then don't give a fuck a monitor lizard.</v>

1905
00:54:47.580 --> 00:54:48.281
<v Speaker 4>I believe some.</v>

1906
00:54:48.281 --> 00:54:48.480
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1907
00:54:48.480 --> 00:54:50.340
<v Speaker 4>Some of the reptilians are humans.</v>

1908
00:54:50.880 --> 00:54:51.031
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1909
00:54:51.031 --> 00:54:51.864
<v Speaker 4>they came back.</v>

1910
00:54:52.780 --> 00:54:53.071
<v Speaker 4>You think?</v>

1911
00:54:53.071 --> 00:54:58.071
<v Speaker 4>So tell species sort of a reincarnation you to the wind in the willows.</v>

1912
00:54:58.531 --> 00:54:59.364
<v Speaker 4>What are you doing about it?</v>

1913
00:54:59.440 --> 00:55:00.150
<v Speaker 4>So cute.</v>

1914
00:55:00.150 --> 00:55:02.400
<v Speaker 4>When you're talking about making the choice,</v>

1915
00:55:02.430 --> 00:55:03.870
<v Speaker 4>like in another dimension,</v>

1916
00:55:03.871 --> 00:55:05.010
<v Speaker 4>like a psychedelic dimension,</v>

1917
00:55:05.011 --> 00:55:09.600
<v Speaker 4>making the choice to to resist in this life and that you create your reality.</v>

1918
00:55:09.930 --> 00:55:10.381
<v Speaker 4>Do you,</v>

1919
00:55:10.381 --> 00:55:13.620
<v Speaker 4>do you think that that people can be other animals?</v>

1920
00:55:14.580 --> 00:55:17.550
<v Speaker 4>Do you think that a life form is just a life form of humans?</v>

1921
00:55:17.550 --> 00:55:18.420
<v Speaker 4>The only one with a soul?</v>

1922
00:55:18.480 --> 00:55:19.480
<v Speaker 4>What do you think you want to know to know?</v>

1923
00:55:19.481 --> 00:55:20.191
<v Speaker 4>I think that this,</v>

1924
00:55:20.191 --> 00:55:25.191
<v Speaker 4>I think that this earth is a place of biological life and that it is a special</v>

1925
00:55:25.951 --> 00:55:26.580
<v Speaker 4>place that,</v>

1926
00:55:26.580 --> 00:55:27.420
<v Speaker 4>that um,</v>

1927
00:55:27.990 --> 00:55:31.080
<v Speaker 4>all the other dimensional spirits can come and work through Karma.</v>

1928
00:55:31.081 --> 00:55:33.510
<v Speaker 4>It's one of the only thing places where you can get through Karma.</v>

1929
00:55:33.720 --> 00:55:38.720
<v Speaker 4>That's why I don't blame anybody for anything that is quote unquote wrong with</v>

1930
00:55:38.941 --> 00:55:39.240
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>

1931
00:55:39.240 --> 00:55:41.010
<v Speaker 4>So you think this is like a waystation?</v>

1932
00:55:41.050 --> 00:55:41.410
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1933
00:55:41.410 --> 00:55:42.243
<v Speaker 4>I think this is,</v>

1934
00:55:42.420 --> 00:55:43.253
<v Speaker 4>I think this is,</v>

1935
00:55:43.580 --> 00:55:44.010
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1936
00:55:44.010 --> 00:55:45.210
<v Speaker 4>this is a waystation station where you learn,</v>

1937
00:55:45.211 --> 00:55:46.680
<v Speaker 4>I think this is a life school.</v>

1938
00:55:47.130 --> 00:55:48.420
<v Speaker 4>This is a school.</v>

1939
00:55:48.540 --> 00:55:49.350
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1940
00:55:49.350 --> 00:55:50.183
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

1941
00:55:50.850 --> 00:55:51.683
<v Speaker 4>There you go.</v>

1942
00:55:51.990 --> 00:55:52.823
<v Speaker 4>That's fascinating.</v>

1943
00:55:53.090 --> 00:55:53.923
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1944
00:55:54.300 --> 00:55:54.571
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1945
00:55:54.571 --> 00:55:59.550
<v Speaker 4>what's really fascinating also is how different people come to it at different</v>

1946
00:55:59.551 --> 00:56:03.030
<v Speaker 4>levels that come to it from different starting points economically and</v>

1947
00:56:03.031 --> 00:56:04.980
<v Speaker 4>physically and geographically.</v>

1948
00:56:05.340 --> 00:56:06.270
<v Speaker 4>It's all about what,</v>

1949
00:56:06.450 --> 00:56:08.690
<v Speaker 4>what you need to ascend.</v>

1950
00:56:08.700 --> 00:56:10.770
<v Speaker 4>We are all ascending and last.</v>

1951
00:56:10.771 --> 00:56:11.750
<v Speaker 4>You're stuck in Africa.</v>

1952
00:56:11.751 --> 00:56:12.680
<v Speaker 4>And when those shitty towns,</v>

1953
00:56:12.681 --> 00:56:17.420
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't even have water now or they're so close to,</v>

1954
00:56:17.460 --> 00:56:18.810
<v Speaker 4>or they so close to nature,</v>

1955
00:56:19.350 --> 00:56:20.090
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

1956
00:56:20.090 --> 00:56:21.510
<v Speaker 4>that's the cradle of civilization.</v>

1957
00:56:21.511 --> 00:56:21.780
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>

1958
00:56:21.780 --> 00:56:23.910
<v Speaker 4>they've existed for of years.</v>

1959
00:56:24.090 --> 00:56:24.451
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1960
00:56:24.451 --> 00:56:25.830
<v Speaker 1>But they get eaten by lions.</v>

1961
00:56:25.860 --> 00:56:26.460
<v Speaker 1>It's true.</v>

1962
00:56:26.460 --> 00:56:27.000
<v Speaker 1>That's not,</v>

1963
00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:27.301
<v Speaker 1>that's not,</v>

1964
00:56:27.301 --> 00:56:29.430
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying it's good or right.</v>

1965
00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:33.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying there's always a different way to look at everything I guess.</v>

1966
00:56:33.480 --> 00:56:35.340
<v Speaker 1>I guess every day that you don't get eaten by lions,</v>

1967
00:56:35.341 --> 00:56:36.174
<v Speaker 1>just you saying,</v>

1968
00:56:36.330 --> 00:56:36.651
<v Speaker 1>there you go.</v>

1969
00:56:36.651 --> 00:56:36.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1970
00:56:36.960 --> 00:56:38.310
<v Speaker 1>And you get that gratitude,</v>

1971
00:56:38.820 --> 00:56:40.890
<v Speaker 1>but then they eat like fly hamburgers.</v>

1972
00:56:40.891 --> 00:56:41.724
<v Speaker 1>You ever seen that?</v>

1973
00:56:42.420 --> 00:56:43.253
<v Speaker 1>Have you seen that?</v>

1974
00:56:44.010 --> 00:56:45.180
<v Speaker 1>See I choose not to.</v>

1975
00:56:45.210 --> 00:56:46.260
<v Speaker 1>It's the craziest thing ever.</v>

1976
00:56:46.360 --> 00:56:46.690
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

1977
00:56:46.690 --> 00:56:48.570
<v Speaker 1>the d like mosquitoes,</v>

1978
00:56:48.750 --> 00:56:49.291
<v Speaker 1>mosquitoes,</v>

1979
00:56:49.291 --> 00:56:53.160
<v Speaker 1>they make like a cheeseburger with mosquitoes and they take them and they use a</v>

1980
00:56:53.161 --> 00:56:57.510
<v Speaker 1>pan and the mosquitoes are so thick around them that they take these pants,</v>

1981
00:56:57.511 --> 00:57:01.140
<v Speaker 1>like it's a giant like cooking pot and they throw it through the air and as</v>

1982
00:57:01.141 --> 00:57:02.820
<v Speaker 1>they're like swinging it through the air,</v>

1983
00:57:02.821 --> 00:57:06.210
<v Speaker 1>it's killing these mosquitoes because they're hitting the back metal and they</v>

1984
00:57:06.211 --> 00:57:07.410
<v Speaker 1>keep doing this over and over again.</v>

1985
00:57:07.410 --> 00:57:11.550
<v Speaker 1>It's sticks to the bottom and they scrape it up and then they fry it and make</v>

1986
00:57:11.551 --> 00:57:14.850
<v Speaker 1>like a sad face off and all the flies fallen to the mosquitoes.</v>

1987
00:57:15.270 --> 00:57:15.750
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

1988
00:57:15.750 --> 00:57:16.583
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>

1989
00:57:16.770 --> 00:57:18.900
<v Speaker 1>I guess that's better than getting eaten by a lion,</v>

1990
00:57:20.140 --> 00:57:20.973
<v Speaker 1>but I dunno.</v>

1991
00:57:21.040 --> 00:57:21.570
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1992
00:57:21.570 --> 00:57:23.040
<v Speaker 1>it's yet,</v>

1993
00:57:23.310 --> 00:57:27.240
<v Speaker 1>none of us can understand what that person is even going through.</v>

1994
00:57:27.241 --> 00:57:31.140
<v Speaker 1>When you look at all the poverty and all the terrible places on earth and the</v>

1995
00:57:31.141 --> 00:57:33.060
<v Speaker 1>war and all the strife and all the thing,</v>

1996
00:57:33.300 --> 00:57:37.560
<v Speaker 1>and then you look at the good aspects of life and you know,</v>

1997
00:57:37.561 --> 00:57:41.340
<v Speaker 1>and when people were cool to each other and kind,</v>

1998
00:57:41.341 --> 00:57:42.960
<v Speaker 1>and when you look at this,</v>

1999
00:57:42.990 --> 00:57:44.490
<v Speaker 1>this big balance,</v>

2000
00:57:44.790 --> 00:57:45.031
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2001
00:57:45.031 --> 00:57:45.361
<v Speaker 1>what do you,</v>

2002
00:57:45.361 --> 00:57:46.051
<v Speaker 1>what do you see?</v>

2003
00:57:46.051 --> 00:57:47.730
<v Speaker 1>Do you see like a work in progress?</v>

2004
00:57:47.790 --> 00:57:49.110
<v Speaker 1>I see like a gym.</v>

2005
00:57:49.200 --> 00:57:50.400
<v Speaker 1>I see a beautiful</v>

2006
00:57:50.500 --> 00:57:53.470
<v Speaker 3>creation that works so perfectly.</v>

2007
00:57:53.500 --> 00:57:58.500
<v Speaker 3>This whole reality is like a super mega bio computer that is so brilliantly</v>

2008
00:58:00.791 --> 00:58:03.190
<v Speaker 3>engineered that we can't even see it,</v>

2009
00:58:03.250 --> 00:58:04.210
<v Speaker 3>that we don't even know we're in it.</v>

2010
00:58:04.211 --> 00:58:09.190
<v Speaker 3>We come here and we forget about it and when I look at the bad and the good,</v>

2011
00:58:09.930 --> 00:58:10.360
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

2012
00:58:10.360 --> 00:58:11.890
<v Speaker 3>I'm grateful for the whole experience.</v>

2013
00:58:12.340 --> 00:58:14.740
<v Speaker 3>I'm grateful for everything this is,</v>

2014
00:58:14.950 --> 00:58:15.790
<v Speaker 3>I'm learning,</v>

2015
00:58:15.820 --> 00:58:16.301
<v Speaker 3>I'm growing,</v>

2016
00:58:16.301 --> 00:58:17.134
<v Speaker 3>I'm creating.</v>

2017
00:58:17.170 --> 00:58:18.790
<v Speaker 3>That's all I can't do.</v>

2018
00:58:18.970 --> 00:58:20.680
<v Speaker 3>I can't feel their pain for them.</v>

2019
00:58:20.681 --> 00:58:21.820
<v Speaker 3>I can't take their pain away.</v>

2020
00:58:21.821 --> 00:58:22.130
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

2021
00:58:22.130 --> 00:58:26.200
<v Speaker 3>they are here to work through that and make their choices.</v>

2022
00:58:27.270 --> 00:58:27.560
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

2023
00:58:27.560 --> 00:58:27.940
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2024
00:58:27.940 --> 00:58:32.940
<v Speaker 1>the issue also comes down to a sort of educating more people to the idea that</v>

2025
00:58:36.001 --> 00:58:38.760
<v Speaker 1>the reality that you choose to accept the way your,</v>

2026
00:58:38.761 --> 00:58:41.460
<v Speaker 1>your reality is in front of you at this very moment.</v>

2027
00:58:41.461 --> 00:58:41.601
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

2028
00:58:41.601 --> 00:58:44.350
<v Speaker 1>what you can write on paper and take pictures of that.</v>

2029
00:58:44.360 --> 00:58:45.690
<v Speaker 1>That is your life.</v>

2030
00:58:46.050 --> 00:58:46.883
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>

2031
00:58:47.240 --> 00:58:48.600
<v Speaker 1>this is just where you are right now.</v>

2032
00:58:48.650 --> 00:58:49.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2033
00:58:49.160 --> 00:58:50.580
<v Speaker 1>This is what you're doing right now.</v>

2034
00:58:50.810 --> 00:58:55.810
<v Speaker 3>We are only aware of 4% of the whole energetic spectrum of,</v>

2035
00:58:57.261 --> 00:58:58.690
<v Speaker 3>of energy that that may,</v>

2036
00:58:58.820 --> 00:58:59.091
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

2037
00:58:59.091 --> 00:59:00.080
<v Speaker 3>I'm talking physics,</v>

2038
00:59:00.800 --> 00:59:05.800
<v Speaker 3>only 4% of it can we see there's 96% of a whole energetic world that we are</v>

2039
00:59:09.561 --> 00:59:10.394
<v Speaker 3>unaware of.</v>

2040
00:59:11.180 --> 00:59:12.110
<v Speaker 3>So it's kind of silly that,</v>

2041
00:59:12.490 --> 00:59:12.620
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2042
00:59:12.620 --> 00:59:13.341
<v Speaker 3>and this is again,</v>

2043
00:59:13.341 --> 00:59:16.310
<v Speaker 3>science that we think that that 4% is everything.</v>

2044
00:59:16.850 --> 00:59:17.390
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>

2045
00:59:17.390 --> 00:59:18.223
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2046
00:59:18.410 --> 00:59:19.310
<v Speaker 1>Well this still has,</v>

2047
00:59:19.370 --> 00:59:20.091
<v Speaker 1>how many isn't there?</v>

2048
00:59:20.091 --> 00:59:22.040
<v Speaker 1>Like a massive of the university</v>

2049
00:59:22.040 --> 00:59:23.420
<v Speaker 3>they believe is dark matter.</v>

2050
00:59:23.720 --> 00:59:26.150
<v Speaker 3>And they don't even know exactly what that is.</v>

2051
00:59:26.930 --> 00:59:29.900
<v Speaker 3>Because what's happening is I think in the next 10 years,</v>

2052
00:59:30.140 --> 00:59:31.340
<v Speaker 3>our own scientist,</v>

2053
00:59:31.350 --> 00:59:32.240
<v Speaker 3>and it's already begun,</v>

2054
00:59:32.270 --> 00:59:33.110
<v Speaker 3>they're starting to say,</v>

2055
00:59:33.860 --> 00:59:34.693
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2056
00:59:35.360 --> 00:59:38.660
<v Speaker 3>we are seeing that our universe is constantly expanding.</v>

2057
00:59:38.661 --> 00:59:39.201
<v Speaker 3>You've heard that,</v>

2058
00:59:39.201 --> 00:59:39.381
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2059
00:59:39.381 --> 00:59:40.161
<v Speaker 3>The constant expanding.</v>

2060
00:59:40.161 --> 00:59:44.600
<v Speaker 3>Well that expansion is the creation is us creating an intending.</v>

2061
00:59:44.601 --> 00:59:46.640
<v Speaker 3>That's the nature of our universe.</v>

2062
00:59:46.641 --> 00:59:47.151
<v Speaker 3>And as above,</v>

2063
00:59:47.151 --> 00:59:47.870
<v Speaker 3>so below.</v>

2064
00:59:47.870 --> 00:59:49.850
<v Speaker 3>So are we constantly expanding.</v>

2065
00:59:49.851 --> 00:59:50.750
<v Speaker 3>We are this great,</v>

2066
00:59:50.751 --> 00:59:53.120
<v Speaker 3>huge Mandela where this,</v>

2067
00:59:53.121 --> 00:59:53.954
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2068
00:59:54.020 --> 00:59:54.853
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2069
00:59:55.330 --> 00:59:55.720
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2070
00:59:55.720 --> 00:59:57.530
<v Speaker 3>I forget what owl there goes my brain.</v>

2071
00:59:57.531 --> 00:59:58.900
<v Speaker 3>See I smoke too much saying</v>

2072
01:00:01.170 --> 01:00:01.370
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2073
01:00:01.370 --> 01:00:02.001
<v Speaker 3>it's this.</v>

2074
01:00:02.001 --> 01:00:02.360
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2075
01:00:02.360 --> 01:00:03.500
<v Speaker 3>it's the thing that Hologram,</v>

2076
01:00:03.501 --> 01:00:04.334
<v Speaker 3>that's it.</v>

2077
01:00:04.340 --> 01:00:04.640
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

2078
01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:07.280
<v Speaker 3>and when you understand a Hologram,</v>

2079
01:00:07.340 --> 01:00:09.260
<v Speaker 3>a piece of a hologram contains the whole thing.</v>

2080
01:00:10.430 --> 01:00:12.500
<v Speaker 3>And that's how we are as human beings.</v>

2081
01:00:12.501 --> 01:00:17.150
<v Speaker 3>We are in this hologram and each of us have a hologram was like a fractal.</v>

2082
01:00:17.270 --> 01:00:17.571
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2083
01:00:17.571 --> 01:00:18.404
<v Speaker 3>Is a fractal.</v>

2084
01:00:18.560 --> 01:00:18.921
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

2085
01:00:18.921 --> 01:00:19.700
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know that.</v>

2086
01:00:19.700 --> 01:00:20.360
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2087
01:00:20.360 --> 01:00:21.020
<v Speaker 3>And we are,</v>

2088
01:00:21.020 --> 01:00:24.980
<v Speaker 3>and when you understand Hologram and what it is,</v>

2089
01:00:24.981 --> 01:00:27.170
<v Speaker 3>you'll understand that we live in a holographic universe.</v>

2090
01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:29.610
<v Speaker 3>So the only way somebody wrote a book,</v>

2091
01:00:30.120 --> 01:00:30.953
<v Speaker 3>Holographic Universe,</v>

2092
01:00:30.970 --> 01:00:31.761
<v Speaker 3>I started reading it,</v>

2093
01:00:31.761 --> 01:00:32.594
<v Speaker 3>but I don't know what happened.</v>

2094
01:00:33.520 --> 01:00:33.830
<v Speaker 3>Kids,</v>

2095
01:00:33.830 --> 01:00:34.321
<v Speaker 3>they can be,</v>

2096
01:00:34.321 --> 01:00:34.640
<v Speaker 3>it can,</v>

2097
01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:35.420
<v Speaker 3>it's a big,</v>

2098
01:00:35.420 --> 01:00:35.900
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2099
01:00:35.900 --> 01:00:37.760
<v Speaker 3>piece of steak to digest.</v>

2100
01:00:37.850 --> 01:00:42.290
<v Speaker 3>The idea though is becoming more and more mainstream that the reality that we</v>

2101
01:00:42.291 --> 01:00:45.380
<v Speaker 3>see in front of us might not be the entire picture.</v>

2102
01:00:45.690 --> 01:00:47.060
<v Speaker 3>That's let's just start there.</v>

2103
01:00:47.270 --> 01:00:48.051
<v Speaker 3>Let's start start there.</v>

2104
01:00:48.051 --> 01:00:48.884
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2105
01:00:48.920 --> 01:00:49.101
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2106
01:00:49.101 --> 01:00:50.750
<v Speaker 3>But the issue comes when,</v>

2107
01:00:50.810 --> 01:00:55.680
<v Speaker 3>when people get all either incredulous or hippy dippy,</v>

2108
01:00:55.700 --> 01:00:56.810
<v Speaker 3>you know either or.</v>

2109
01:00:56.870 --> 01:00:58.010
<v Speaker 3>You have to stay in the middle of,</v>

2110
01:00:58.040 --> 01:01:00.950
<v Speaker 3>that's what's gonna save us is that people in the middle.</v>

2111
01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:02.420
<v Speaker 3>That's why I've said button like gays,</v>

2112
01:01:02.421 --> 01:01:03.530
<v Speaker 3>I was out in the straights and gays,</v>

2113
01:01:03.531 --> 01:01:05.870
<v Speaker 3>but it's the bisexuals that are going to save us because they're going to go,</v>

2114
01:01:05.871 --> 01:01:06.200
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>

2115
01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:07.033
<v Speaker 3>I just want to choice.</v>

2116
01:01:08.570 --> 01:01:10.040
<v Speaker 3>Or they're just greedy or agree.</v>

2117
01:01:10.041 --> 01:01:10.780
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2118
01:01:10.780 --> 01:01:12.680
<v Speaker 3>Did the double your numbers are my numbers.</v>

2119
01:01:12.681 --> 01:01:13.514
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2120
01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:19.000
<v Speaker 3>Have you paid any attention to these recent ideas of a computer simulation</v>

2121
01:01:20.271 --> 01:01:25.160
<v Speaker 3>theory that the earth is some or the universe itself as a simulation?</v>

2122
01:01:25.850 --> 01:01:26.091
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2123
01:01:26.091 --> 01:01:27.110
<v Speaker 3>it depends on how you look at it.</v>

2124
01:01:27.111 --> 01:01:27.860
<v Speaker 3>I do.</v>

2125
01:01:27.860 --> 01:01:28.910
<v Speaker 3>When you see,</v>

2126
01:01:28.940 --> 01:01:33.290
<v Speaker 3>when you as I have just just studied the fractal,</v>

2127
01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:34.730
<v Speaker 3>that nature,</v>

2128
01:01:34.760 --> 01:01:35.480
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2129
01:01:35.480 --> 01:01:37.190
<v Speaker 3>the nature of the universe,</v>

2130
01:01:37.340 --> 01:01:38.720
<v Speaker 3>the quantum physics,</v>

2131
01:01:39.470 --> 01:01:42.290
<v Speaker 3>it's the perfection is astounding.</v>

2132
01:01:43.130 --> 01:01:44.150
<v Speaker 3>And then you start to think,</v>

2133
01:01:44.360 --> 01:01:44.571
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2134
01:01:44.571 --> 01:01:45.440
<v Speaker 3>we as a,</v>

2135
01:01:45.441 --> 01:01:49.160
<v Speaker 3>as a human race are just trying to replicate what we see.</v>

2136
01:01:49.161 --> 01:01:51.500
<v Speaker 3>And so we've made computers and we are like,</v>

2137
01:01:51.501 --> 01:01:52.040
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2138
01:01:52.040 --> 01:01:53.690
<v Speaker 3>this brain can't think that fast,</v>

2139
01:01:53.691 --> 01:01:56.690
<v Speaker 3>but I can get this computer to think that fast and all of a sudden these</v>

2140
01:01:57.200 --> 01:02:01.040
<v Speaker 3>computers are starting to look like reality.</v>

2141
01:02:01.041 --> 01:02:01.581
<v Speaker 3>Wait a minute,</v>

2142
01:02:01.581 --> 01:02:02.930
<v Speaker 3>maybe our reality is,</v>

2143
01:02:03.420 --> 01:02:04.430
<v Speaker 3>and then you,</v>

2144
01:02:04.431 --> 01:02:05.330
<v Speaker 3>you walk away with,</v>

2145
01:02:05.331 --> 01:02:05.601
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2146
01:02:05.601 --> 01:02:08.270
<v Speaker 3>it's just intelligent design and I,</v>

2147
01:02:08.450 --> 01:02:08.990
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2148
01:02:08.990 --> 01:02:11.750
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to get outside of the game right now so I might as well play the</v>

2149
01:02:11.751 --> 01:02:12.584
<v Speaker 3>game and I might as well,</v>

2150
01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:14.090
<v Speaker 3>I understand the rules now.</v>

2151
01:02:15.140 --> 01:02:15.711
<v Speaker 3>The what,</v>

2152
01:02:15.711 --> 01:02:15.861
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

2153
01:02:15.861 --> 01:02:17.420
<v Speaker 3>whatever the design is.</v>

2154
01:02:17.450 --> 01:02:20.070
<v Speaker 3>It seems pretty clear that there's</v>

2155
01:02:21.180 --> 01:02:22.260
<v Speaker 1>no question about it.</v>

2156
01:02:22.290 --> 01:02:27.000
<v Speaker 1>There's some sort of a progression going on and this is a progression going on</v>

2157
01:02:27.001 --> 01:02:28.350
<v Speaker 1>with human consciousness,</v>

2158
01:02:28.351 --> 01:02:29.790
<v Speaker 1>with human innovation.</v>

2159
01:02:30.060 --> 01:02:32.550
<v Speaker 1>But there also is a progression going on constantly,</v>

2160
01:02:32.551 --> 01:02:33.240
<v Speaker 1>and the universe,</v>

2161
01:02:33.240 --> 01:02:34.470
<v Speaker 1>new galaxies are for me.</v>

2162
01:02:34.580 --> 01:02:34.770
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2163
01:02:34.770 --> 01:02:36.720
<v Speaker 4>he knew new stars are forming.</v>

2164
01:02:37.220 --> 01:02:37.530
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

2165
01:02:37.530 --> 01:02:38.251
<v Speaker 4>it's very,</v>

2166
01:02:38.251 --> 01:02:38.641
<v Speaker 4>very,</v>

2167
01:02:38.641 --> 01:02:42.480
<v Speaker 4>very strange because to think that somehow or another,</v>

2168
01:02:42.481 --> 01:02:43.620
<v Speaker 4>it's all just happening.</v>

2169
01:02:43.930 --> 01:02:44.270
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2170
01:02:44.270 --> 01:02:45.040
<v Speaker 4>why?</v>

2171
01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:46.050
<v Speaker 4>What's going on?</v>

2172
01:02:46.051 --> 01:02:47.610
<v Speaker 4>What's causing it to happen?</v>

2173
01:02:47.611 --> 01:02:48.240
<v Speaker 4>Is it just,</v>

2174
01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:49.650
<v Speaker 4>it just is okay.</v>

2175
01:02:49.651 --> 01:02:53.160
<v Speaker 4>But even it just is unbelievably fascinating.</v>

2176
01:02:53.190 --> 01:02:53.490
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

2177
01:02:53.490 --> 01:02:54.121
<v Speaker 4>It just,</v>

2178
01:02:54.121 --> 01:02:55.080
<v Speaker 4>is it good?</v>

2179
01:02:55.081 --> 01:02:56.160
<v Speaker 4>Don't you don't have to call it God,</v>

2180
01:02:56.190 --> 01:03:01.190
<v Speaker 4>but it just is the force behind hyper Novas the force behind black holes and the</v>

2181
01:03:02.551 --> 01:03:04.070
<v Speaker 4>idea of fractal universes.</v>

2182
01:03:04.260 --> 01:03:07.760
<v Speaker 4>It's the force behind the idea that inside every galaxy,</v>

2183
01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:12.330
<v Speaker 4>a supermassive black hole with one half of 1% of the mass of the galaxy and</v>

2184
01:03:12.331 --> 01:03:17.331
<v Speaker 4>inside that galaxy may very well be a whole nother universe with hundreds of</v>

2185
01:03:17.670 --> 01:03:21.120
<v Speaker 4>billions of black holes and hundreds of billions of galaxies around them.</v>

2186
01:03:21.540 --> 01:03:22.170
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

2187
01:03:22.170 --> 01:03:22.891
<v Speaker 4>And each one of them,</v>

2188
01:03:22.891 --> 01:03:23.730
<v Speaker 4>another universe,</v>

2189
01:03:23.760 --> 01:03:24.480
<v Speaker 4>and it's,</v>

2190
01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:26.190
<v Speaker 4>and you can go the other way and go inside your body.</v>

2191
01:03:26.250 --> 01:03:26.390
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2192
01:03:26.390 --> 01:03:31.390
<v Speaker 4>You can look at yourselves and you can find exactly the same wonderment when</v>

2193
01:03:31.561 --> 01:03:33.000
<v Speaker 4>they get to that string theory shit.</v>

2194
01:03:33.100 --> 01:03:38.100
<v Speaker 4>And they start talking about everything being strings that are vibrating and</v>

2195
01:03:38.990 --> 01:03:41.010
<v Speaker 4>it's all in how much hair there is.</v>

2196
01:03:41.040 --> 01:03:43.530
<v Speaker 4>Even in live oak tree,</v>

2197
01:03:43.531 --> 01:03:44.670
<v Speaker 4>this is all space.</v>

2198
01:03:44.690 --> 01:03:44.851
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2199
01:03:44.851 --> 01:03:46.620
<v Speaker 4>That space is the 96%.</v>

2200
01:03:46.621 --> 01:03:48.030
<v Speaker 4>The 4% is what our,</v>

2201
01:03:48.680 --> 01:03:49.170
<v Speaker 4>our,</v>

2202
01:03:49.170 --> 01:03:53.160
<v Speaker 4>our in our brains hold together in front of us so we can have this experience</v>

2203
01:03:53.370 --> 01:03:56.580
<v Speaker 4>and create the idea that a rock is all space.</v>

2204
01:03:57.450 --> 01:03:58.270
<v Speaker 4>That's what it is.</v>

2205
01:03:58.270 --> 01:03:58.380
<v Speaker 4>Good.</v>

2206
01:03:58.380 --> 01:03:59.460
<v Speaker 4>Put it under a microscope.</v>

2207
01:03:59.480 --> 01:03:59.760
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2208
01:03:59.760 --> 01:03:59.941
<v Speaker 4>You'll,</v>

2209
01:03:59.941 --> 01:04:00.810
<v Speaker 4>you'll see it immediately.</v>

2210
01:04:00.811 --> 01:04:00.961
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2211
01:04:00.961 --> 01:04:01.661
<v Speaker 4>If you go deep,</v>

2212
01:04:01.661 --> 01:04:01.970
<v Speaker 4>deep,</v>

2213
01:04:01.970 --> 01:04:02.221
<v Speaker 4>deep,</v>

2214
01:04:02.221 --> 01:04:02.521
<v Speaker 4>deep,</v>

2215
01:04:02.521 --> 01:04:03.270
<v Speaker 4>deep,</v>

2216
01:04:03.270 --> 01:04:04.710
<v Speaker 4>you see that most of it is just,</v>

2217
01:04:04.711 --> 01:04:05.760
<v Speaker 4>what is this?</v>

2218
01:04:05.761 --> 01:04:06.810
<v Speaker 4>Just the way it vibrates.</v>

2219
01:04:06.811 --> 01:04:07.950
<v Speaker 4>This crazy shit.</v>

2220
01:04:08.190 --> 01:04:10.020
<v Speaker 4>That's just the way it's vibrating.</v>

2221
01:04:10.050 --> 01:04:11.550
<v Speaker 4>I never thought I was never a school.</v>

2222
01:04:11.551 --> 01:04:12.480
<v Speaker 4>I was always just music,</v>

2223
01:04:12.481 --> 01:04:12.631
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2224
01:04:12.631 --> 01:04:13.081
<v Speaker 4>hanging out,</v>

2225
01:04:13.081 --> 01:04:13.890
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>

2226
01:04:13.890 --> 01:04:16.710
<v Speaker 4>When I started actually reading about quantum physics,</v>

2227
01:04:16.850 --> 01:04:17.683
<v Speaker 4>Ken,</v>

2228
01:04:18.060 --> 01:04:18.893
<v Speaker 4>Ken Wilber,</v>

2229
01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:19.741
<v Speaker 4>really great.</v>

2230
01:04:19.741 --> 01:04:20.130
<v Speaker 4>He's,</v>

2231
01:04:20.130 --> 01:04:20.963
<v Speaker 4>he's,</v>

2232
01:04:21.370 --> 01:04:21.870
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2233
01:04:21.870 --> 01:04:22.980
<v Speaker 4>based in science.</v>

2234
01:04:23.100 --> 01:04:23.490
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2235
01:04:23.490 --> 01:04:24.070
<v Speaker 4>Bill Lipton,</v>

2236
01:04:24.070 --> 01:04:24.390
<v Speaker 4>they're all,</v>

2237
01:04:24.390 --> 01:04:26.160
<v Speaker 4>they're based in science and they're saying,</v>

2238
01:04:26.161 --> 01:04:26.401
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

2239
01:04:26.401 --> 01:04:29.460
<v Speaker 4>this is the wonderment we found and we think it means more.</v>

2240
01:04:31.130 --> 01:04:36.130
<v Speaker 1>There's a gentleman who recently did an interview with Neil degrasse Tyson who,</v>

2241
01:04:36.571 --> 01:04:36.970
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2242
01:04:36.970 --> 01:04:39.680
<v Speaker 1>I should give them credit so people could look this up.</v>

2243
01:04:39.920 --> 01:04:40.190
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2244
01:04:40.190 --> 01:04:43.700
<v Speaker 1>it's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard in my life.</v>

2245
01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:45.460
<v Speaker 1>Coming from a scientist when his lid,</v>

2246
01:04:45.480 --> 01:04:49.760
<v Speaker 1>he essentially said was that in the inner workings of quantum physics,</v>

2247
01:04:49.761 --> 01:04:53.000
<v Speaker 1>when they get to these bad ass crazy equations,</v>

2248
01:04:53.180 --> 01:04:57.740
<v Speaker 1>one of the things they found is self correcting computer code and this self</v>

2249
01:04:57.741 --> 01:05:02.730
<v Speaker 1>correct and computer code was a type of code that was invented they thought in</v>

2250
01:05:02.740 --> 01:05:03.800
<v Speaker 1>the 1940s.</v>

2251
01:05:04.280 --> 01:05:05.113
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

2252
01:05:05.210 --> 01:05:06.043
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2253
01:05:06.140 --> 01:05:06.620
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2254
01:05:06.620 --> 01:05:06.921
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

2255
01:05:06.921 --> 01:05:10.950
<v Speaker 1>they found this very code in the theories bond and the,</v>

2256
01:05:10.951 --> 01:05:12.410
<v Speaker 1>the calculations of quantum physics.</v>

2257
01:05:12.411 --> 01:05:13.370
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the fuck,</v>

2258
01:05:15.140 --> 01:05:15.321
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2259
01:05:15.321 --> 01:05:16.190
<v Speaker 4>it sounds like,</v>

2260
01:05:16.220 --> 01:05:17.053
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

2261
01:05:17.220 --> 01:05:18.053
<v Speaker 4>Clearly</v>

2262
01:05:18.300 --> 01:05:22.050
<v Speaker 1>we are discovering ourselves and we're discovering the great code,</v>

2263
01:05:22.470 --> 01:05:23.400
<v Speaker 1>the gigantic,</v>

2264
01:05:23.610 --> 01:05:23.911
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2265
01:05:23.911 --> 01:05:26.610
<v Speaker 1>computer that is this beautiful earth and is us.</v>

2266
01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:27.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2267
01:05:27.780 --> 01:05:28.650
<v Speaker 1>I guess,</v>

2268
01:05:29.820 --> 01:05:32.250
<v Speaker 1>but it just seems like even putting a label on it.</v>

2269
01:05:32.370 --> 01:05:32.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2270
01:05:32.910 --> 01:05:34.830
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the things that I've always felt like,</v>

2271
01:05:34.860 --> 01:05:35.693
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2272
01:05:36.430 --> 01:05:39.930
<v Speaker 1>is the gentleman's name is James Gates and he's the one who discovered this</v>

2273
01:05:39.931 --> 01:05:40.764
<v Speaker 1>computer code.</v>

2274
01:05:40.770 --> 01:05:44.850
<v Speaker 1>So it's she just go check it out and read it online cause it's so crazy.</v>

2275
01:05:44.940 --> 01:05:49.940
<v Speaker 1>You wrap your head around this doubly even self dual linear binary error</v>

2276
01:05:50.791 --> 01:05:55.791
<v Speaker 1>correcting block code first invented in the 1940s has been discovered.</v>

2277
01:05:57.600 --> 01:06:01.320
<v Speaker 1>I mean it literally is like the Matrix if this guy's right.</v>

2278
01:06:01.330 --> 01:06:01.980
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2279
01:06:01.980 --> 01:06:03.510
<v Speaker 1>It literally is like the Matrix.</v>

2280
01:06:04.020 --> 01:06:04.853
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

2281
01:06:05.350 --> 01:06:06.183
<v Speaker 1>come on.</v>

2282
01:06:06.410 --> 01:06:06.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2283
01:06:06.720 --> 01:06:11.720
<v Speaker 1>Well the idea is that if they were able to create a simulation that it would be</v>

2284
01:06:13.171 --> 01:06:17.020
<v Speaker 1>indiscernible from reality and that what we might've already done this,</v>

2285
01:06:17.030 --> 01:06:22.030
<v Speaker 1>we might have already transgressed from the biological life into this symbiotic</v>

2286
01:06:22.141 --> 01:06:23.070
<v Speaker 1>sort of computer life.</v>

2287
01:06:23.370 --> 01:06:24.000
<v Speaker 1>We just don't,</v>

2288
01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:24.390
<v Speaker 1>we don't,</v>

2289
01:06:24.390 --> 01:06:25.410
<v Speaker 1>we don't recognize it yet.</v>

2290
01:06:25.530 --> 01:06:30.390
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of it is when you realize that you are creating what's in front of</v>

2291
01:06:30.391 --> 01:06:31.224
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

2292
01:06:31.740 --> 01:06:33.870
<v Speaker 1>then you can get out of that game.</v>

2293
01:06:35.580 --> 01:06:36.840
<v Speaker 1>That's fucking ridiculous.</v>

2294
01:06:37.550 --> 01:06:38.910
<v Speaker 1>Try it I guess,</v>

2295
01:06:39.030 --> 01:06:41.120
<v Speaker 1>but the problem is does it only work?</v>

2296
01:06:41.121 --> 01:06:43.170
<v Speaker 1>It looks like that's what how I felt about the secret.</v>

2297
01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:44.940
<v Speaker 1>I'm like they're only interviewing winners.</v>

2298
01:06:44.941 --> 01:06:45.840
<v Speaker 1>I don't lose her.</v>

2299
01:06:45.841 --> 01:06:46.890
<v Speaker 1>Sort of tried the secret.</v>

2300
01:06:47.010 --> 01:06:49.560
<v Speaker 1>There was like a young lady who's a very nice person.</v>

2301
01:06:49.561 --> 01:06:50.640
<v Speaker 1>She's a friend of,</v>

2302
01:06:50.641 --> 01:06:51.474
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2307
01:06:54.211 --> 01:06:54.751
<v Speaker 1>Kelly Kirsten.</v>

2308
01:06:54.751 --> 01:06:58.130
<v Speaker 1>She used to always come down to the comedy store and a,</v>

2309
01:06:58.170 --> 01:07:00.420
<v Speaker 1>she was a super positive and she,</v>

2310
01:07:00.750 --> 01:07:01.620
<v Speaker 1>I remember she came down,</v>

2311
01:07:01.621 --> 01:07:02.940
<v Speaker 1>she's telling us about the secret,</v>

2312
01:07:03.330 --> 01:07:03.631
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2313
01:07:03.631 --> 01:07:05.580
<v Speaker 1>she just started doing the secret,</v>

2314
01:07:05.581 --> 01:07:09.480
<v Speaker 1>living a lie by the secret and everything's amazing now and I can see how I'm</v>

2315
01:07:09.481 --> 01:07:12.690
<v Speaker 1>going to totally manufacturer a completely new life.</v>

2316
01:07:13.080 --> 01:07:13.471
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

2317
01:07:13.471 --> 01:07:14.010
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2318
01:07:14.010 --> 01:07:15.060
<v Speaker 1>then I met them.</v>

2319
01:07:15.061 --> 01:07:17.910
<v Speaker 1>I didn't see her again for about two years.</v>

2320
01:07:18.210 --> 01:07:18.601
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

2321
01:07:18.601 --> 01:07:18.781
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2322
01:07:18.781 --> 01:07:21.900
<v Speaker 1>I met them again at another comedy club and I'm like,</v>

2323
01:07:21.930 --> 01:07:22.051
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

2324
01:07:22.051 --> 01:07:24.000
<v Speaker 1>she was all bummed out and I go,</v>

2325
01:07:24.001 --> 01:07:24.271
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2326
01:07:24.271 --> 01:07:24.571

<v Speaker 1>how you been?</v>

2328
01:07:25.220 --> 01:07:25.680
<v Speaker 1>What's going on?</v>

2329
01:07:25.680 --> 01:07:27.480
<v Speaker 1>You still do the end of that secret thing?</v>

2330
01:07:27.840 --> 01:07:28.673
<v Speaker 1>And she goes,</v>

2331
01:07:28.740 --> 01:07:29.400
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2332
01:07:29.400 --> 01:07:34.380
<v Speaker 1>I really wanted to see if this makes sense to anyone else because I've been</v>

2333
01:07:34.381 --> 01:07:37.740
<v Speaker 1>doing everything they said and my life is a fucking wreck.</v>

2334
01:07:38.040 --> 01:07:38.551
<v Speaker 1>And she's like,</v>

2335
01:07:38.551 --> 01:07:39.930
<v Speaker 1>and I have all these people in my life,</v>

2336
01:07:39.931 --> 01:07:42.690
<v Speaker 1>I can't get rid of them and I can't get them to straighten their life out.</v>

2337
01:07:42.691 --> 01:07:46.680
<v Speaker 1>And I'm always dragged into this bad relationship over and over and over again</v>

2338
01:07:46.681 --> 01:07:47.520
<v Speaker 1>and job socks,</v>

2339
01:07:47.560 --> 01:07:48.001
<v Speaker 1>work socks.</v>

2340
01:07:48.001 --> 01:07:48.241
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2341
01:07:48.241 --> 01:07:49.050
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

2342
01:07:49.050 --> 01:07:50.970
<v Speaker 1>absolutely be in the secret to,</v>

2343
01:07:51.050 --> 01:07:51.883
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2344
01:07:52.780 --> 01:07:56.220
<v Speaker 1>you need to like let people know you can't just think things and all of sudden</v>

2345
01:07:56.221 --> 01:07:57.054
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>

2346
01:07:57.210 --> 01:07:59.520
<v Speaker 3>That's why I call the secret to Mcdonald's.</v>

2347
01:07:59.770 --> 01:08:00.301
<v Speaker 3>You can,</v>

2348
01:08:00.301 --> 01:08:00.590
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2349
01:08:00.590 --> 01:08:01.423
<v Speaker 3>it's a process.</v>

2350
01:08:01.430 --> 01:08:01.660
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

2351
01:08:01.660 --> 01:08:02.550
<v Speaker 3>it's the idea,</v>

2352
01:08:02.551 --> 01:08:03.330
<v Speaker 3>which is great.</v>

2353
01:08:03.330 --> 01:08:05.280
<v Speaker 3>I love that they got the idea in there.</v>

2354
01:08:05.700 --> 01:08:08.310
<v Speaker 3>It takes practice because it is belief.</v>

2355
01:08:08.311 --> 01:08:09.960
<v Speaker 3>If you look at your life and you believe,</v>

2356
01:08:10.290 --> 01:08:10.411
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2357
01:08:10.411 --> 01:08:12.420
<v Speaker 3>I don't have enough and I want this,</v>

2358
01:08:12.540 --> 01:08:13.920
<v Speaker 3>you are coming from lack.</v>

2359
01:08:14.100 --> 01:08:15.860
<v Speaker 3>So you are creating lack.</v>

2360
01:08:16.130 --> 01:08:16.580
<v Speaker 4>It's a,</v>

2361
01:08:16.580 --> 01:08:17.900
<v Speaker 4>it's a crazy,</v>

2362
01:08:18.630 --> 01:08:19.463
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2363
01:08:20.270 --> 01:08:25.010
<v Speaker 4>formula and how you think it's very hippy dippy.</v>

2364
01:08:25.910 --> 01:08:26.840
<v Speaker 4>People must get upset.</v>

2365
01:08:26.841 --> 01:08:27.740
<v Speaker 4>That kind of thinking.</v>

2366
01:08:27.830 --> 01:08:28.251
<v Speaker 4>Do you ever have,</v>

2367
01:08:28.251 --> 01:08:30.260
<v Speaker 4>I don't come them around me to know.</v>

2368
01:08:32.770 --> 01:08:33.320
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2369
01:08:33.320 --> 01:08:38.320
<v Speaker 4>what they would go after is they would go after the idea of children with a</v>

2370
01:08:39.020 --> 01:08:40.580
<v Speaker 4>terrible diseases is their choice.</v>

2371
01:08:41.150 --> 01:08:42.110
<v Speaker 4>That's what they would go after.</v>

2372
01:08:42.111 --> 01:08:45.410
<v Speaker 4>After that is where it breaks down because people don't,</v>

2373
01:08:46.040 --> 01:08:49.910
<v Speaker 4>people want to hold on to the thought that it is possible for something.</v>

2374
01:08:49.911 --> 01:08:51.140
<v Speaker 4>Just to happen to you</v>

2375
01:08:52.850 --> 01:08:53.750
<v Speaker 4>with no reason.</v>

2376
01:08:54.260 --> 01:08:57.860
<v Speaker 4>So do you believe that this life leads into another one?</v>

2377
01:08:57.861 --> 01:08:58.261
<v Speaker 4>And you,</v>

2378
01:08:58.261 --> 01:09:02.360
<v Speaker 4>you do this life the best you can and then reap the bounty in the next life.</v>

2379
01:09:02.390 --> 01:09:03.620
<v Speaker 4>My belief now,</v>

2380
01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:03.831
<v Speaker 4>now,</v>

2381
01:09:03.831 --> 01:09:04.320
<v Speaker 4>cause that's,</v>

2382
01:09:04.320 --> 01:09:08.570
<v Speaker 4>that's my belief is this is a school,</v>

2383
01:09:08.600 --> 01:09:09.200
<v Speaker 4>like I said,</v>

2384
01:09:09.200 --> 01:09:14.090
<v Speaker 4>and that we are all ascending and there are those who've gone before us who have</v>

2385
01:09:14.091 --> 01:09:17.210
<v Speaker 4>figured it out and overcame death,</v>

2386
01:09:17.810 --> 01:09:18.680
<v Speaker 4>which is pretty intense.</v>

2387
01:09:18.710 --> 01:09:19.610
<v Speaker 4>That's a lot of work.</v>

2388
01:09:20.500 --> 01:09:21.333
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2389
01:09:21.650 --> 01:09:26.570
<v Speaker 4>there are those who understand that death is a transition and they are done here</v>

2390
01:09:26.571 --> 01:09:26.751
<v Speaker 4>with,</v>

2391
01:09:26.751 --> 01:09:27.081
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

2392
01:09:27.081 --> 01:09:29.840
<v Speaker 4>I've learned every day I'm ready to move on.</v>

2393
01:09:30.500 --> 01:09:35.500
<v Speaker 4>And there are those who choose death game over because you know what,</v>

2394
01:09:35.670 --> 01:09:37.670
<v Speaker 4>I can't quite figure it out and I'm gonna try it again.</v>

2395
01:09:37.671 --> 01:09:37.881
<v Speaker 4>Let me,</v>

2396
01:09:37.881 --> 01:09:38.714
<v Speaker 4>let me do it again.</v>

2397
01:09:39.680 --> 01:09:39.981
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2398
01:09:39.981 --> 01:09:40.430
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>

2399
01:09:40.430 --> 01:09:40.880
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2400
01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:45.880
<v Speaker 4>the transitionary phase for a lot of people was made easier by psychedelics.</v>

2401
01:09:46.550 --> 01:09:47.450
<v Speaker 4>Larry Hagman,</v>

2402
01:09:47.780 --> 01:09:48.230
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2403
01:09:48.230 --> 01:09:50.420
<v Speaker 4>was doing an interview on CNN.</v>

2404
01:09:50.421 --> 01:09:50.651
<v Speaker 4>It was,</v>

2405
01:09:50.651 --> 01:09:50.741
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

2406
01:09:50.741 --> 01:09:52.970
<v Speaker 4>it's really fascinating to see him talk about it.</v>

2407
01:09:53.330 --> 01:09:55.970
<v Speaker 4>And he was talking about how when he did acid,</v>

2408
01:09:56.090 --> 01:09:58.190
<v Speaker 4>it released him from fear of death.</v>

2409
01:09:58.220 --> 01:09:58.431
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2410
01:09:58.431 --> 01:09:59.300
<v Speaker 4>poorly released it.</v>

2411
01:09:59.690 --> 01:10:02.270
<v Speaker 4>So like knowing that and knowing that he died recently,</v>

2412
01:10:02.300 --> 01:10:03.133
<v Speaker 4>it was like,</v>

2413
01:10:03.140 --> 01:10:07.550
<v Speaker 4>it was comforting knowing that that guy had that experience and had this</v>

2414
01:10:07.551 --> 01:10:08.361
<v Speaker 4>different perception,</v>

2415
01:10:08.361 --> 01:10:11.900
<v Speaker 4>which really mellowed him out and made them kinder and gentler and sort of he</v>

2416
01:10:11.901 --> 01:10:14.320
<v Speaker 4>saw saw it for what it really is.</v>

2417
01:10:14.320 --> 01:10:16.310
<v Speaker 4>It's supposedly really is.</v>

2418
01:10:16.340 --> 01:10:16.581
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2419
01:10:16.581 --> 01:10:17.414
<v Speaker 4>maybe he's just dead.</v>

2420
01:10:17.840 --> 01:10:18.560
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

2421
01:10:18.560 --> 01:10:19.970
<v Speaker 4>That's what a lot of people would like you to thank.</v>

2422
01:10:19.971 --> 01:10:20.960
<v Speaker 4>His body is dead.</v>

2423
01:10:21.380 --> 01:10:21.801
<v Speaker 4>His spear,</v>

2424
01:10:21.801 --> 01:10:23.150
<v Speaker 4>all spirits totally live on.</v>

2425
01:10:23.151 --> 01:10:23.331
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2426
01:10:23.331 --> 01:10:25.480
<v Speaker 4>that's just silly to not think that,</v>

2427
01:10:26.420 --> 01:10:27.980
<v Speaker 4>but why would you choose?</v>

2428
01:10:27.981 --> 01:10:30.770
<v Speaker 4>Why would you choose to believe that this is it and when the lights go out,</v>

2429
01:10:30.771 --> 01:10:31.131
<v Speaker 4>that's it.</v>

2430
01:10:31.131 --> 01:10:32.330
<v Speaker 4>And it's over forever.</v>

2431
01:10:32.331 --> 01:10:32.900
<v Speaker 4>Never.</v>

2432
01:10:32.900 --> 01:10:35.330
<v Speaker 4>Why would you choose to believe that it's not though?</v>

2433
01:10:35.360 --> 01:10:36.560
<v Speaker 4>Because why would you choose to believe that?</v>

2434
01:10:36.561 --> 01:10:37.860
<v Speaker 4>When I go to sleep train,</v>

2435
01:10:38.030 --> 01:10:38.940
<v Speaker 4>when you take a nap,</v>

2436
01:10:39.310 --> 01:10:40.640
<v Speaker 4>you assume you're going to wake up,</v>

2437
01:10:41.210 --> 01:10:42.890
<v Speaker 4>but you're not afraid to just shut off.</v>

2438
01:10:43.580 --> 01:10:43.970
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2439
01:10:43.970 --> 01:10:44.300
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2440
01:10:44.300 --> 01:10:45.380
<v Speaker 4>Why be afraid anyway?</v>

2441
01:10:45.550 --> 01:10:45.950
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2442
01:10:45.950 --> 01:10:47.270
<v Speaker 4>Why be afraid to just shut off.</v>

2443
01:10:47.271 --> 01:10:48.350
<v Speaker 4>It don't have to live forever.</v>

2444
01:10:48.860 --> 01:10:49.790
<v Speaker 4>You can just shut off too.</v>

2445
01:10:49.791 --> 01:10:51.350
<v Speaker 4>That's what I really know.</v>

2446
01:10:51.351 --> 01:10:51.651
<v Speaker 4>When you,</v>

2447
01:10:51.651 --> 01:10:53.210
<v Speaker 4>when you overcome the fear of death,</v>

2448
01:10:53.960 --> 01:10:55.560
<v Speaker 4>you really free yourself up.</v>

2449
01:10:55.810 --> 01:10:56.021
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2450
01:10:56.021 --> 01:10:57.790
<v Speaker 4>you've got to realize that it's gonna suck.</v>

2451
01:10:58.380 --> 01:10:59.213
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

2452
01:10:59.570 --> 01:11:02.930
<v Speaker 4>are we going to die screaming and a you buy is going to fail,</v>

2453
01:11:05.120 --> 01:11:07.190
<v Speaker 4>but then the next things happen.</v>

2454
01:11:07.220 --> 01:11:07.400
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2455
01:11:07.400 --> 01:11:08.510
<v Speaker 4>if you're in a plane crash,</v>

2456
01:11:08.511 --> 01:11:09.350
<v Speaker 4>did you manifest?</v>

2457
01:11:09.560 --> 01:11:10.940
<v Speaker 4>You manifest that?</v>

2458
01:11:11.510 --> 01:11:12.170
<v Speaker 4>You think so?</v>

2459
01:11:12.170 --> 01:11:12.960
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>

2460
01:11:12.960 --> 01:11:14.010
<v Speaker 4>Whoa.</v>

2461
01:11:14.070 --> 01:11:14.903
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>

2462
01:11:15.030 --> 01:11:15.750
<v Speaker 4>Again,</v>

2463
01:11:15.750 --> 01:11:16.740
<v Speaker 4>not blame.</v>

2464
01:11:16.920 --> 01:11:17.251
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2465
01:11:17.251 --> 01:11:20.760
<v Speaker 4>Not blame mamasans since one asshole in the plane that manifests.</v>

2466
01:11:20.790 --> 01:11:21.361
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2467
01:11:21.361 --> 01:11:22.194
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

2468
01:11:23.290 --> 01:11:24.570
<v Speaker 4>What if he's the shoe bomber?</v>

2469
01:11:24.900 --> 01:11:26.490
<v Speaker 4>If there's a shoe bomber on your plane,</v>

2470
01:11:26.491 --> 01:11:27.480
<v Speaker 4>did you manifest that?</v>

2471
01:11:28.920 --> 01:11:29.580
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

2472
01:11:29.580 --> 01:11:30.413
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

2473
01:11:30.780 --> 01:11:31.320
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

2474
01:11:31.320 --> 01:11:32.670
<v Speaker 4>You really sure of this.</v>

2475
01:11:33.030 --> 01:11:33.880
<v Speaker 4>You accessed Joe.</v>

2476
01:11:34.740 --> 01:11:35.970
<v Speaker 4>My belief,</v>

2477
01:11:36.630 --> 01:11:40.230
<v Speaker 4>I do believe and then I have to let go and go and I've,</v>

2478
01:11:40.260 --> 01:11:42.360
<v Speaker 4>I believe that I do not need that lesson.</v>

2479
01:11:42.390 --> 01:11:43.560
<v Speaker 4>I do not need to die.</v>

2480
01:11:44.190 --> 01:11:46.320
<v Speaker 4>It terrifyingly in a plane crash.</v>

2481
01:11:46.350 --> 01:11:47.520
<v Speaker 4>I do not need that.</v>

2482
01:11:47.610 --> 01:11:48.360
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2483
01:11:48.360 --> 01:11:48.630
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2484
01:11:48.630 --> 01:11:50.250
<v Speaker 4>so I'm not even gonna think about that.</v>

2485
01:11:50.280 --> 01:11:51.510
<v Speaker 4>That is not even a possibility.</v>

2486
01:11:51.510 --> 01:11:52.920
<v Speaker 4>When I born in an airplane,</v>

2487
01:11:52.950 --> 01:11:55.260
<v Speaker 4>I actually think this is because I fly a lot.</v>

2488
01:11:55.261 --> 01:11:58.770
<v Speaker 4>And for the first few years it was I was a white knuckle.</v>

2489
01:11:59.010 --> 01:11:59.251
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2490
01:11:59.251 --> 01:12:00.270
<v Speaker 4>every little thing was like,</v>

2491
01:12:00.271 --> 01:12:00.661
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2492
01:12:00.661 --> 01:12:01.290
<v Speaker 4>I'm going down,</v>

2493
01:12:01.290 --> 01:12:01.501
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2494
01:12:01.501 --> 01:12:01.981
<v Speaker 4>rock stars,</v>

2495
01:12:01.981 --> 01:12:02.371
<v Speaker 4>airplanes.</v>

2496
01:12:02.371 --> 01:12:02.641
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

2497
01:12:02.641 --> 01:12:03.240
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

2498
01:12:03.240 --> 01:12:04.710
<v Speaker 4>So I,</v>

2499
01:12:04.830 --> 01:12:05.580
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2500
01:12:05.580 --> 01:12:07.110
<v Speaker 4>when I board an airplane now I think,</v>

2501
01:12:07.200 --> 01:12:10.260
<v Speaker 4>look at all these lucky people because there is no way this plane's going to do</v>

2502
01:12:10.261 --> 01:12:12.980
<v Speaker 4>anything because that's not what I signed up for.</v>

2503
01:12:13.020 --> 01:12:13.680
<v Speaker 4>That is,</v>

2504
01:12:13.680 --> 01:12:15.660
<v Speaker 4>that's not the end of the lifetime movie.</v>

2505
01:12:15.661 --> 01:12:16.440
<v Speaker 4>It's not,</v>

2506
01:12:16.440 --> 01:12:17.280
<v Speaker 4>well that is a,</v>

2507
01:12:17.330 --> 01:12:20.700
<v Speaker 4>a very positive way of looking at life.</v>

2508
01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:22.740
<v Speaker 4>And if you're a correct,</v>

2509
01:12:23.610 --> 01:12:24.630
<v Speaker 4>it's going to be amazing.</v>

2510
01:12:24.660 --> 01:12:25.493
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

2511
01:12:25.880 --> 01:12:28.230
<v Speaker 4>I hope you around to match the face.</v>

2512
01:12:28.850 --> 01:12:29.760
<v Speaker 4>Isn't it funny though,</v>

2513
01:12:29.761 --> 01:12:31.520
<v Speaker 4>because even if your life was a masterpiece,</v>

2514
01:12:31.530 --> 01:12:33.110
<v Speaker 4>people like she got lucky.</v>

2515
01:12:34.320 --> 01:12:35.190
<v Speaker 4>And that's belief.</v>

2516
01:12:35.250 --> 01:12:37.110
<v Speaker 4>If you choose to always believe that,</v>

2517
01:12:37.200 --> 01:12:37.470
<v Speaker 4>see,</v>

2518
01:12:37.470 --> 01:12:38.101
<v Speaker 4>look at my life,</v>

2519
01:12:38.101 --> 01:12:38.490
<v Speaker 4>it's bad.</v>

2520
01:12:38.490 --> 01:12:39.271
<v Speaker 4>It will be bad.</v>

2521
01:12:39.271 --> 01:12:40.770
<v Speaker 4>The real problem with that is the people who,</v>

2522
01:12:40.771 --> 01:12:42.620
<v Speaker 4>what will people believe all sorts of silly things.</v>

2523
01:12:42.621 --> 01:12:44.220
<v Speaker 4>And when I say to that is yes,</v>

2524
01:12:44.221 --> 01:12:49.221
<v Speaker 4>but the real issue is have we shown that beliefs can change reality?</v>

2525
01:12:50.161 --> 01:12:50.401
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

2526
01:12:50.401 --> 01:12:51.840
<v Speaker 4>we can through the placebo method.</v>

2527
01:12:51.870 --> 01:12:53.850
<v Speaker 4>That's the real,</v>

2528
01:12:53.970 --> 01:12:57.450
<v Speaker 4>that's scientifically measured effect where they've shown that they can give you</v>

2529
01:12:57.451 --> 01:12:59.580
<v Speaker 4>something that is not physically active.</v>

2530
01:12:59.581 --> 01:13:03.600
<v Speaker 4>It's an inert substance and the idea of taking it for whatever reason,</v>

2531
01:13:03.601 --> 01:13:04.950
<v Speaker 4>you believe that this sugar pill,</v>

2532
01:13:04.951 --> 01:13:05.880
<v Speaker 4>which is actually poison,</v>

2533
01:13:05.881 --> 01:13:06.150
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>

2534
01:13:06.150 --> 01:13:06.720
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

2535
01:13:06.720 --> 01:13:07.420
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2536
01:13:07.420 --> 01:13:10.560
<v Speaker 4>there's doing something is changing your life.</v>

2537
01:13:10.680 --> 01:13:12.750
<v Speaker 4>That's why I tell people when they come to me with cancer,</v>

2538
01:13:12.751 --> 01:13:12.961
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>

2539
01:13:12.961 --> 01:13:13.830
<v Speaker 4>what do you believe?</v>

2540
01:13:13.831 --> 01:13:16.140
<v Speaker 4>Do you believe that this chemotherapy is going to help you?</v>

2541
01:13:16.141 --> 01:13:16.950
<v Speaker 4>Do you believe that?</v>

2542
01:13:16.950 --> 01:13:18.480
<v Speaker 4>Then go with your belief.</v>

2543
01:13:18.481 --> 01:13:19.350
<v Speaker 4>What about r Kelly?</v>

2544
01:13:19.351 --> 01:13:20.490
<v Speaker 4>Cause he believes he can fly.</v>

2545
01:13:20.640 --> 01:13:21.540
<v Speaker 4>Well then there's that,</v>

2546
01:13:21.810 --> 01:13:23.310
<v Speaker 4>but then he does a lot of other shit.</v>

2547
01:13:23.520 --> 01:13:24.450
<v Speaker 4>That's really rude.</v>

2548
01:13:24.950 --> 01:13:26.390
<v Speaker 4>So fly.</v>

2549
01:13:27.700 --> 01:13:28.533
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2550
01:13:28.820 --> 01:13:30.730
<v Speaker 4>If our Kelly could just stop peeing on people,</v>

2551
01:13:30.890 --> 01:13:35.690
<v Speaker 4>maybe old just saying doesn't do that anymore.</v>

2552
01:13:35.700 --> 01:13:39.390
<v Speaker 4>You just saying don't judge because out of that space are you in R Kelly fan?</v>

2553
01:13:39.690 --> 01:13:40.920
<v Speaker 4>You stick up for our musicians,</v>

2554
01:13:40.921 --> 01:13:41.360
<v Speaker 4>is it?</v>

2555
01:13:41.360 --> 01:13:41.671
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2556
01:13:41.671 --> 01:13:41.881
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2557
01:13:41.881 --> 01:13:41.991
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2558
01:13:41.991 --> 01:13:42.101
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2559
01:13:42.101 --> 01:13:42.191
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2560
01:13:42.191 --> 01:13:42.390
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

2561
01:13:42.390 --> 01:13:45.240
<v Speaker 4>I think people make their own reality in the world.</v>

2562
01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:46.710
<v Speaker 4>You're aware of our Kelly?</v>

2563
01:13:46.980 --> 01:13:48.150
<v Speaker 4>I am aware of him,</v>

2564
01:13:48.151 --> 01:13:48.510
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

2565
01:13:48.510 --> 01:13:50.520
<v Speaker 4>Have you ever watched any of his music videos?</v>

2566
01:13:51.410 --> 01:13:51.791
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2567
01:13:51.791 --> 01:13:52.030
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>

2568
01:13:52.030 --> 01:13:53.630
<v Speaker 4>I just watched Chappelle where they always,</v>

2569
01:13:54.970 --> 01:13:57.570
<v Speaker 4>this is unintentional comedy.</v>

2570
01:13:57.571 --> 01:14:01.440
<v Speaker 4>It's amongst the greatest things the world has ever known for real.</v>

2571
01:14:01.441 --> 01:14:04.620
<v Speaker 4>There's a video called real talk and you must watch it.</v>

2572
01:14:04.740 --> 01:14:07.830
<v Speaker 4>I will preferably under medicated conditions.</v>

2573
01:14:08.940 --> 01:14:12.150
<v Speaker 4>Then the ridiculousness of comes blaring</v>

2574
01:14:12.150 --> 01:14:13.800
<v Speaker 1>at you like an awesome parody,</v>

2575
01:14:14.100 --> 01:14:15.210
<v Speaker 1>but it's not a parody.</v>

2576
01:14:15.211 --> 01:14:15.421
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2577
01:14:15.421 --> 01:14:16.111
<v Speaker 1>I don't think,</v>

2578
01:14:16.111 --> 01:14:17.590
<v Speaker 1>I mean he might be like parenting alone,</v>

2579
01:14:17.910 --> 01:14:19.080
<v Speaker 1>try and be a little bit funny,</v>

2580
01:14:19.081 --> 01:14:20.730
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of it's just,</v>

2581
01:14:20.760 --> 01:14:21.930
<v Speaker 1>he's bananas.</v>

2582
01:14:22.340 --> 01:14:24.060

01:14:48.721 --> 01:14:49.770
<v Speaker 3>It's about the balance and,</v>

2599
01:14:49.830 --> 01:14:50.241
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>

2600
01:14:50.241 --> 01:14:50.641
<v Speaker 3>I grew up,</v>

2601
01:14:50.641 --> 01:14:54.270
<v Speaker 3>my father was a huge football fan and just adored my father and he,</v>

2602
01:14:54.630 --> 01:14:56.010
<v Speaker 3>he passed away when I was 30 but he was,</v>

2603
01:14:56.040 --> 01:14:56.580
<v Speaker 3>he just,</v>

2604
01:14:56.580 --> 01:14:58.980
<v Speaker 3>he was a football coach and basketball coach.</v>

2605
01:14:58.981 --> 01:14:59.690
<v Speaker 3>So I just,</v>

2606
01:14:59.690 --> 01:14:59.940
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2607
01:14:59.940 --> 01:15:00.570
<v Speaker 3>I love that.</v>

2608
01:15:00.570 --> 01:15:02.610
<v Speaker 3>And I grew up in the Midwest and it was a big part of my life.</v>

2609
01:15:02.670 --> 01:15:03.181
<v Speaker 3>Cause your team,</v>

2610
01:15:03.181 --> 01:15:03.840
<v Speaker 3>Kansas.</v>

2611
01:15:03.840 --> 01:15:04.170
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2612
01:15:04.170 --> 01:15:06.270
<v Speaker 3>can you image the Kansas City chiefs?</v>

2613
01:15:06.271 --> 01:15:08.550
<v Speaker 3>We are in dead last this year.</v>

<v Speaker 3>See,</v>

2617
01:15:12.400 --> 01:15:13.231
<v Speaker 3>everything's a metaphor.</v>

2618
01:15:13.231 --> 01:15:14.064
<v Speaker 3>Life is a metaphor.</v>

2619
01:15:14.140 --> 01:15:18.260
<v Speaker 3>Watching me now I'm going to choose the best is the Patriots case.</v>

2621
01:15:24.480 --> 01:15:24.930
<v Speaker 3>It isn't.</v>

2622
01:15:24.930 --> 01:15:26.580
<v Speaker 3>The money can see unfortunately,</v>

2631
01:15:37.890 --> 01:15:38.790
<v Speaker 1>give them the right food.</v>

2632
01:15:39.690 --> 01:15:43.500
<v Speaker 1>There's this guys to this day that are recruiting kids and then when they go out</v>

2633
01:15:43.501 --> 01:15:44.640
<v Speaker 1>and get high school kids,</v>

2634
01:15:44.641 --> 01:15:45.030
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

2635
01:15:45.030 --> 01:15:48.840
<v Speaker 1>they find these white dudes that can shoot a penny that you throw in the air</v>

2636
01:15:48.841 --> 01:15:51.040
<v Speaker 1>with a rock and the other good football like a,</v>

2637
01:15:51.060 --> 01:15:51.811
<v Speaker 1>like a piston.</v>

<v Speaker 1>running backs that have ungodly speed and they just keep a good eye on them and</v>

2641
01:15:58.890 --> 01:16:01.470
<v Speaker 1>follow them through college and so much money in football.</v>

2642
01:16:01.471 --> 01:16:02.550
<v Speaker 1>They'd be crazy not to.</v>

2643
01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.400
<v Speaker 1>The athletes that are being born today,</v>

2644
01:16:05.580 --> 01:16:06.570
<v Speaker 1>look at the quarterbacks,</v>

2645
01:16:06.571 --> 01:16:06.751
<v Speaker 1>the new,</v>

2646
01:16:06.751 --> 01:16:08.300
<v Speaker 1>they're changing the game that the,</v>

2647
01:16:08.440 --> 01:16:13.440
<v Speaker 1>just the technology and training athletes and the athletes are realizations now</v>

2648
01:16:13.770 --> 01:16:17.730
<v Speaker 1>of what's possible with various strength and conditioning programs and diet.</v>

2649
01:16:17.850 --> 01:16:19.740
<v Speaker 1>Stanford just came out with some glove.</v>

2650
01:16:19.741 --> 01:16:21.120
<v Speaker 1>This is really crazy.</v>

2651
01:16:21.420 --> 01:16:22.560
<v Speaker 1>It's a glove,</v>

2652
01:16:22.590 --> 01:16:25.350
<v Speaker 1>a cooling glove that's better than steroids.</v>

2653
01:16:25.800 --> 01:16:26.311
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2654
01:16:26.311 --> 01:16:26.661
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2655
01:16:26.661 --> 01:16:27.481
<v Speaker 1>it's legal.</v>

2656
01:16:27.481 --> 01:16:28.530
<v Speaker 1>Completely legal.</v>

2657
01:16:28.620 --> 01:16:29.790
<v Speaker 1>Somehow or another,</v>

2658
01:16:29.791 --> 01:16:34.791
<v Speaker 1>they put your body in this glove and the glove is,</v>

2659
01:16:35.250 --> 01:16:37.890
<v Speaker 1>it freezes somehow or another.</v>

2660
01:16:37.891 --> 01:16:38.581
<v Speaker 1>Your body,</v>

2661
01:16:38.581 --> 01:16:43.020
<v Speaker 1>it cools you down and it cools you down in a way that lets you recuperate at an</v>

2662
01:16:43.021 --> 01:16:44.310
<v Speaker 1>incredibly rapid pace.</v>

2663
01:16:44.470 --> 01:16:45.303
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

2664
01:16:45.590 --> 01:16:47.700
<v Speaker 1>it's complete new thing they figured out.</v>

2665
01:16:47.850 --> 01:16:50.130
<v Speaker 1>So people are going to be able to take this.</v>

2666
01:16:50.190 --> 01:16:52.860
<v Speaker 1>They get a little workout unbelievably hard.</v>

2667
01:16:53.010 --> 01:16:56.880
<v Speaker 1>Where this cooling glove and through no illegal methods,</v>

2668
01:16:56.881 --> 01:16:58.440
<v Speaker 1>no unnatural drugs,</v>

2669
01:16:58.470 --> 01:16:59.670
<v Speaker 1>just cooling their body.</v>

2670
01:16:59.671 --> 01:17:01.410
<v Speaker 1>They're gonna recuperate like crazy</v>

2671
01:17:01.760 --> 01:17:06.760
<v Speaker 3>when they start working with the body's amazing properties to create a better</v>

2672
01:17:07.401 --> 01:17:07.671
<v Speaker 3>body.</v>

2673
01:17:07.671 --> 01:17:08.750
<v Speaker 3>That's when it's going to work.</v>

2674
01:17:08.980 --> 01:17:09.110
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2675
01:17:09.110 --> 01:17:10.340
<v Speaker 3>This is like a hijack.</v>

2676
01:17:10.460 --> 01:17:13.570
<v Speaker 1>They found like a fuck up with the system though.</v>

2677
01:17:13.630 --> 01:17:16.980
<v Speaker 1>It was cool that body temperature down and that's a thing they'd been doing with</v>

2678
01:17:17.150 --> 01:17:18.350
<v Speaker 1>ice pass as well.</v>

2679
01:17:18.530 --> 01:17:19.820
<v Speaker 1>That's something that you know,</v>

2680
01:17:19.840 --> 01:17:21.230
<v Speaker 1>didn't really exist that long ago,</v>

2681
01:17:21.440 --> 01:17:23.540
<v Speaker 1>but now they're after training.</v>

2682
01:17:23.570 --> 01:17:26.240
<v Speaker 1>A lot of guys do these crazy ice baths.</v>

2683
01:17:26.870 --> 01:17:27.531
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

2684
01:17:27.531 --> 01:17:28.364
<v Speaker 1>It's hard.</v>

2685
01:17:28.940 --> 01:17:30.910
<v Speaker 1>It's so hard to like relax in there.</v>

2686
01:17:31.730 --> 01:17:32.241
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

2687
01:17:32.241 --> 01:17:33.080
<v Speaker 1>That's the hard part.</v>

2688
01:17:33.081 --> 01:17:34.150
<v Speaker 1>Once you climb in your,</v>

2689
01:17:34.160 --> 01:17:35.930
<v Speaker 1>your body constricts,</v>

2690
01:17:35.990 --> 01:17:37.100
<v Speaker 1>it can't get any air.</v>

2691
01:17:37.130 --> 01:17:37.370
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

2692
01:17:37.370 --> 01:17:38.203
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

2693
01:17:38.670 --> 01:17:39.503
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

2694
01:17:39.510 --> 01:17:40.310
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

2695
01:17:40.310 --> 01:17:41.330
<v Speaker 1>it's socks.</v>

2696
01:17:41.540 --> 01:17:42.800
<v Speaker 1>But if you could do it,</v>

2697
01:17:42.830 --> 01:17:44.330
<v Speaker 1>it's awesome for your recovery.</v>

2698
01:17:44.450 --> 01:17:44.601
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2699
01:17:44.601 --> 01:17:46.250
<v Speaker 1>this is even better apparently.</v>

2700
01:17:46.400 --> 01:17:47.233
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

2701
01:17:47.660 --> 01:17:49.330
<v Speaker 1>So like the athletes that you're,</v>

2702
01:17:49.331 --> 01:17:50.330
<v Speaker 1>they're getting now,</v>

2703
01:17:50.570 --> 01:17:51.830
<v Speaker 1>they're going to be even bigger.</v>

2704
01:17:51.890 --> 01:17:54.170
<v Speaker 1>They're going to be even faster and they're going to be on the Kansas City</v>

2705
01:17:54.171 --> 01:17:54.900
<v Speaker 1>chiefs.</v>

2706
01:17:54.900 --> 01:17:55.733
<v Speaker 1>You think so?</v>

2707
01:17:55.980 --> 01:17:57.540
<v Speaker 1>We got the first pick the first,</v>

2708
01:17:57.550 --> 01:17:59.480
<v Speaker 1>even our second round pick is huge.</v>

2709
01:17:59.530 --> 01:18:00.530
<v Speaker 1>It's a way up there.</v>

2710
01:18:00.980 --> 01:18:03.140
<v Speaker 1>How does that work with who gets to pick?</v>

2711
01:18:03.370 --> 01:18:05.060
<v Speaker 1>The worst team gets the first pink.</v>

2712
01:18:05.090 --> 01:18:05.571
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

2713
01:18:05.571 --> 01:18:06.321
<v Speaker 1>That's hilarious.</v>

2714
01:18:06.321 --> 01:18:07.730
<v Speaker 1>That sucks for the best guy.</v>

2715
01:18:08.360 --> 01:18:09.530
<v Speaker 1>The worst he gets true.</v>

2716
01:18:09.620 --> 01:18:10.453
<v Speaker 1>But then again,</v>

2717
01:18:10.490 --> 01:18:10.891
<v Speaker 1>let's look,</v>

2718
01:18:10.891 --> 01:18:14.570
<v Speaker 1>Andrew Luck and the colts were the worst team last year that got Andrew Luck.</v>

2719
01:18:14.571 --> 01:18:14.930
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

2720
01:18:14.930 --> 01:18:15.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2721
01:18:15.150 --> 01:18:15.983
<v Speaker 1>made to the playoffs.</v>

2722
01:18:16.130 --> 01:18:16.761
<v Speaker 1>It's not amazing.</v>

2723
01:18:16.761 --> 01:18:18.630
<v Speaker 1>That one super athlete dude,</v>

2724
01:18:18.800 --> 01:18:20.780
<v Speaker 1>one was as a quarterback,</v>

2725

2731
01:18:28.940 --> 01:18:31.310
<v Speaker 1>That's because he believes it and then the other people around it starts</v>

2732
01:18:31.311 --> 01:18:32.240
<v Speaker 1>spreading it and they start.</v>

2735
01:18:41.570 --> 01:18:44.390

01:18:44.570 --> 01:18:45.051
<v Speaker 1>what is it?</v>

2737
01:18:45.051 --> 01:18:46.640
<v Speaker 1>They'll say the difference between,</v>

01:18:46.670 --> 01:18:46.911
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2739
01:18:46.911 --> 01:18:47.101
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2740
01:18:47.101 --> 01:18:49.790
<v Speaker 1>the Ravens and the 40 niners last night.</v>

2741
01:18:50.240 --> 01:18:51.890
<v Speaker 1>The Ravens believed it.</v>

2742
01:18:51.920 --> 01:18:53.870
<v Speaker 1>You can see when the 49 or stopped believing it.</v>

2743
01:18:54.560 --> 01:18:55.250
<v Speaker 1>That's just what,</v>

2744
01:18:55.250 --> 01:18:56.040
<v Speaker 1>it's a thick Newton.</v>

2745
01:18:56.040 --> 01:18:58.490
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's just what you believe.</v>

2746
01:18:58.670 --> 01:19:01.790
<v Speaker 1>And you've created this whole Superbowl and we are just,</v>

2747
01:19:01.791 --> 01:19:05.300
<v Speaker 1>participants are my funny Joe Rogan background.</v>

2748
01:19:05.301 --> 01:19:07.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm your new toy that you just picked up today.</v>

2749
01:19:07.660 --> 01:19:08.750
<v Speaker 1>I go talk to him.</v>

2750
01:19:10.310 --> 01:19:12.200
<v Speaker 1>He just created us in our old world.</v>

2751
01:19:12.650 --> 01:19:14.390
<v Speaker 1>Didn't even exist before you came around,</v>

2752
01:19:14.870 --> 01:19:16.520
<v Speaker 1>but in your world that is the case.</v>

2753
01:19:16.550 --> 01:19:17.540
<v Speaker 1>The reality is,</v>

2754
01:19:17.541 --> 01:19:18.440
<v Speaker 1>and your universe,</v>

2755
01:19:18.441 --> 01:19:21.560
<v Speaker 1>I didn't exist in a physical form until you till we meet each other.</v>

2756
01:19:21.710 --> 01:19:22.730
<v Speaker 1>And you didn't either.</v>

2757
01:19:22.731 --> 01:19:23.750
<v Speaker 1>I saw you on TV,</v>

2758
01:19:23.751 --> 01:19:24.441
<v Speaker 1>I've heard your songs.</v>

2759
01:19:24.441 --> 01:19:26.000
<v Speaker 1>But as a physical human being,</v>

2760
01:19:26.330 --> 01:19:28.400
<v Speaker 1>you didn't exist in my world until today.</v>

2761
01:19:28.610 --> 01:19:30.050
<v Speaker 1>So it really did kind of event you.</v>

2762
01:19:30.200 --> 01:19:30.591
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2763
01:19:30.591 --> 01:19:31.520
<v Speaker 1>And you invented me.</v>

2764
01:19:31.610 --> 01:19:31.941
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2765
01:19:31.941 --> 01:19:32.960
<v Speaker 1>And I'm glad I did that.</v>

2766
01:19:32.990 --> 01:19:37.990
<v Speaker 1>So we're all living in invented universes and they all parallel coexist with</v>

2767
01:19:38.541 --> 01:19:39.230
<v Speaker 1>each other.</v>

2768
01:19:39.230 --> 01:19:41.510
<v Speaker 1>So take charge of your life,</v>

2769
01:19:41.540 --> 01:19:41.990
<v Speaker 1>do it.</v>

2770
01:19:41.990 --> 01:19:42.950
<v Speaker 1>Get your shit together.</v>

2771
01:19:42.951 --> 01:19:43.784
<v Speaker 1>Coaches,</v>

2772
01:19:44.210 --> 01:19:46.990
<v Speaker 1>Melissa Etheridge just dropped some pseudo science</v>

2773
01:19:49.970 --> 01:19:52.380
<v Speaker 1>but wonderfully empowering suicides.</v>

2774
01:19:52.390 --> 01:19:53.060
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2775
01:19:53.060 --> 01:19:53.810
<v Speaker 1>That uh,</v>

2776
01:19:53.810 --> 01:19:57.260
<v Speaker 1>that attitude is one that's espoused by some of the happiest people.</v>

2777
01:19:57.261 --> 01:19:58.970
<v Speaker 1>I know that you create your own reality.</v>

2778
01:19:59.210 --> 01:20:00.140
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2779
01:20:00.290 --> 01:20:01.460
<v Speaker 1>I try to be,</v>

2780
01:20:01.461 --> 01:20:04.370
<v Speaker 1>and I get accused of not being really open minded,</v>

2781
01:20:04.371 --> 01:20:07.710
<v Speaker 1>but I really do try to be as much as possible.</v>

2782
01:20:07.950 --> 01:20:08.070
<v Speaker 1>I</v>

2783
01:20:08.070 --> 01:20:08.391
<v Speaker 4>try to,</v>

2784
01:20:08.391 --> 01:20:10.050
<v Speaker 4>especially since doing this podcast,</v>

2785
01:20:10.051 --> 01:20:15.051
<v Speaker 4>I try to look at every point of every aspect of things and really try and not</v>

2786
01:20:15.301 --> 01:20:17.190
<v Speaker 4>really make opinions on a lot of shit.</v>

2787
01:20:17.191 --> 01:20:17.881
<v Speaker 4>Just go,</v>

2788
01:20:17.881 --> 01:20:18.870
<v Speaker 4>I don't know enough.</v>

2789
01:20:18.890 --> 01:20:19.010
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>

2790
01:20:19.010 --> 01:20:20.160
<v Speaker 4>I really can't say and I,</v>

2791
01:20:20.320 --> 01:20:23.340
<v Speaker 4>I don't like getting into those conversations with people with the claim.</v>

2792
01:20:23.341 --> 01:20:26.310
<v Speaker 4>They do know enough to refute thing.</v>

2793
01:20:26.311 --> 01:20:28.350
<v Speaker 4>I think people enjoy refuting things as well.</v>

2794
01:20:28.630 --> 01:20:29.463
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2795

2797
01:20:30.541 --> 01:20:31.160
<v Speaker 4>it's all,</v>

2798
01:20:31.160 --> 01:20:32.850
<v Speaker 4>if I just look at everyone with belief,</v>

2799
01:20:33.210 --> 01:20:35.310
<v Speaker 4>I you are free to believe what you believe.</v>

2800
01:20:35.311 --> 01:20:36.144
<v Speaker 4>It's wonderful.</v>

2801
01:20:36.540 --> 01:20:37.680
<v Speaker 4>Have you always been an artist?</v>

2802

2835
01:21:08.670 --> 01:21:09.720
<v Speaker 4>Then of course I played in,</v>

2836
01:21:10.230 --> 01:21:11.340
<v Speaker 4>my fingers bled and I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>I want to do it.</v>

2838
01:21:12.091 --> 01:21:13.020
<v Speaker 4>And I kept doing it.</v>

2839
01:21:13.560 --> 01:21:14.393
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

2840
01:21:14.620 --> 01:21:15.040
<v Speaker 4>See,</v>

2841
01:21:15.040 --> 01:21:16.680
<v Speaker 4>I never had a desire to do it,</v>

2842
01:21:16.681 --> 01:21:18.530
<v Speaker 4>but I was always fascinated by,</v>

2843
01:21:18.730 --> 01:21:21.480
<v Speaker 4>it just was never pulled me towards like a career.</v>

2844
01:21:21.481 --> 01:21:22.314
<v Speaker 4>But I was,</v>

2845
01:21:22.380 --> 01:21:27.210
<v Speaker 4>when I was a little kid I was probably like seven and my sister was six and we</v>

2846
01:21:27.211 --> 01:21:32.211
<v Speaker 4>had a little record player play like 45 hours and we had only a couple of</v>

2847
01:21:33.391 --> 01:21:35.940
<v Speaker 4>records and one of them was the things we do for love.</v>

2848
01:21:36.310 --> 01:21:36.950
<v Speaker 4>You know that song?</v>

2849
01:21:36.950 --> 01:21:37.430
<v Speaker 4>I remember that.</v>

2850
01:21:37.430 --> 01:21:37.600
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2851
01:21:37.600 --> 01:21:38.830
<v Speaker 4>The things we do for love,</v>

2852
01:21:39.940 --> 01:21:44.940
<v Speaker 4>the rain and the snow and I was amazed because it was really the only time I'd</v>

2853
01:21:45.931 --> 01:21:49.860
<v Speaker 4>ever have access I'd ever have access to music that I could start and stop.</v>

2854
01:21:50.070 --> 01:21:51.060
<v Speaker 4>I could just decide,</v>

2855
01:21:51.061 --> 01:21:51.450
<v Speaker 4>ready,</v>

2856
01:21:51.450 --> 01:21:53.580
<v Speaker 4>go and then it starts and I was like,</v>

2857
01:21:53.581 --> 01:21:56.910
<v Speaker 4>now I can really pay attention to it as opposed to like walking into a store and</v>

2858
01:21:56.911 --> 01:21:59.850
<v Speaker 4>music is playing or going into a restaurant and music is playing.</v>

2859
01:21:59.851 --> 01:22:02.820
<v Speaker 4>This was my first experience where I actually could turn on the music and turn</v>

2860
01:22:02.821 --> 01:22:03.990
<v Speaker 4>off the music and realize,</v>

2861
01:22:04.020 --> 01:22:04.171
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2862
01:22:04.171 --> 01:22:05.040
<v Speaker 4>this is crazy.</v>

2863
01:22:05.041 --> 01:22:06.610
<v Speaker 4>This is coming out of this fucking desk.</v>

2864
01:22:07.030 --> 01:22:08.040
<v Speaker 4>What is going on here?</v>

2865
01:22:08.190 --> 01:22:12.240
<v Speaker 4>Someone's figured out it made him make this flat black plastic disk and then I</v>

2866
01:22:12.241 --> 01:22:13.150
<v Speaker 4>put this needle,</v>

2867
01:22:13.151 --> 01:22:13.920
<v Speaker 4>he thing on it,</v>

2868
01:22:13.920 --> 01:22:16.920
<v Speaker 4>it spins around and it plays me crazy song tones.</v>

2869
01:22:16.920 --> 01:22:18.210
<v Speaker 4>The vibration you can start,</v>

2870
01:22:18.211 --> 01:22:19.500
<v Speaker 4>you can do the science right there.</v>

2871
01:22:19.501 --> 01:22:24.501
<v Speaker 4>That's vibration on the vinyl and the diamond in the diamonds are like rocks and</v>

2872
01:22:24.960 --> 01:22:25.321
<v Speaker 4>courts.</v>

2873
01:22:25.321 --> 01:22:29.160
<v Speaker 4>That's why all the courts crazy stuff that picks up a vibration and you hear it,</v>

2874
01:22:29.161 --> 01:22:30.630
<v Speaker 4>which is just vibrations on your ear.</v>

2875
01:22:30.780 --> 01:22:33.810
<v Speaker 4>I think it's one of the reasons why I became a standup comedian.</v>

2876
01:22:33.840 --> 01:22:34.290
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2877
01:22:34.290 --> 01:22:35.520
<v Speaker 4>Because listening to that,</v>

2878
01:22:35.521 --> 01:22:37.620
<v Speaker 4>I started asking questions and I remember,</v>

2879
01:22:37.830 --> 01:22:42.330
<v Speaker 4>I really remember this from being seven years old that no one had any answers to</v>

2880
01:22:42.331 --> 01:22:46.770
<v Speaker 4>why they or how they could put that music on a record.</v>

2881
01:22:47.010 --> 01:22:48.030
<v Speaker 4>No one around me.</v>

2882
01:22:48.350 --> 01:22:49.350
<v Speaker 4>I was seven years old.</v>

2883
01:22:49.351 --> 01:22:50.011
<v Speaker 4>I asked my mom,</v>

2884
01:22:50.011 --> 01:22:51.320
<v Speaker 4>she didn't have any fucking idea.</v>

2885
01:22:51.321 --> 01:22:52.020
<v Speaker 4>That's my dad.</v>

2886
01:22:52.020 --> 01:22:52.801
<v Speaker 4>No idea.</v>

2887
01:22:52.801 --> 01:22:54.390
<v Speaker 4>No one had any idea yet.</v>

2888
01:22:54.540 --> 01:22:56.130
<v Speaker 4>There were records all over the place.</v>

2889
01:22:56.490 --> 01:22:56.941
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

2890
01:22:56.941 --> 01:22:57.211
<v Speaker 4>damn,</v>

2891
01:22:57.211 --> 01:22:57.871
<v Speaker 4>this is weird.</v>

2892
01:22:57.871 --> 01:23:00.030
<v Speaker 4>Like why would you guys ask how they make this?</v>

2893
01:23:00.300 --> 01:23:00.411
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

2894
01:23:00.411 --> 01:23:02.970
<v Speaker 4>guess this freaky to you that there's some thing around you.</v>

2895
01:23:02.971 --> 01:23:04.020
<v Speaker 4>Are you curious?</v>

2896
01:23:04.290 --> 01:23:06.000
<v Speaker 4>And I was amazed how many people</v>

2897
01:23:06.030 --> 01:23:06.950
<v Speaker 1>just actually,</v>

2898
01:23:06.951 --> 01:23:08.010
<v Speaker 1>you weren't curious.</v>

2899
01:23:08.400 --> 01:23:09.031
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

2900
01:23:09.031 --> 01:23:14.031
<v Speaker 1>that sort of started me along that path of looking at all these adults with a</v>

2901
01:23:14.401 --> 01:23:15.031
<v Speaker 1>slanted.</v>

2902
01:23:15.031 --> 01:23:15.864
<v Speaker 1>I look like</v>

2903
01:23:16.540 --> 01:23:17.111
<v Speaker 3>I don't touch it.</v>

2904
01:23:17.111 --> 01:23:19.560
<v Speaker 3>You don't know everything might be crazy.</v>

2905
01:23:19.561 --> 01:23:20.050
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2906
01:23:20.050 --> 01:23:21.600
<v Speaker 3>You don't even know how records are made.</v>

2907
01:23:21.601 --> 01:23:22.680
<v Speaker 3>His living your whole life.</v>

2908
01:23:23.160 --> 01:23:23.581
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

2909
01:23:23.581 --> 01:23:25.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm 45 I don't know how records are breaking up.</v>

2910
01:23:25.490 --> 01:23:26.323
<v Speaker 1>Go Fuck,</v>

2911
01:23:27.380 --> 01:23:28.290
<v Speaker 1>but back then,</v>

2912
01:23:28.360 --> 01:23:28.710
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

2913
01:23:28.710 --> 01:23:31.080
<v Speaker 1>when I was a kid I thought these people were ridiculous,</v>

2914
01:23:31.230 --> 01:23:32.760
<v Speaker 1>but if my kid asked me,</v>

2915
01:23:32.761 --> 01:23:33.930
<v Speaker 1>I would at least research it.</v>

2916
01:23:33.931 --> 01:23:34.231
<v Speaker 1>I'll go,</v>

2917

<v Speaker 1>I see you actually respond to people on Twitter.</v>

2934
01:23:49.170 --> 01:23:49.860
<v Speaker 1>You actually,</v>

2935

<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

01:23:53.130 --> 01:23:53.963
<v Speaker 3>It's a fake.</v>

2942
01:23:54.510 --> 01:23:56.730
<v Speaker 3>You don't do any blogs or anything like that,</v>

2943
01:23:56.750 --> 01:23:57.583
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2944
01:23:57.750 --> 01:23:58.560
<v Speaker 3>You can't win.</v>

2945
01:23:58.560 --> 01:23:59.640
<v Speaker 3>You just can't win.</v>

2946
01:23:59.700 --> 01:23:59.851
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2947
01:23:59.851 --> 01:24:00.211
<v Speaker 3>you can't,</v>

2948
01:24:00.211 --> 01:24:00.990
<v Speaker 3>we missed it.</v>

2949
01:24:00.990 --> 01:24:03.030
<v Speaker 3>I missed the whole time and I don't have time to do that.</v>

2950
01:24:03.031 --> 01:24:04.140
<v Speaker 3>I have very,</v>

2951
01:24:04.141 --> 01:24:05.100
<v Speaker 3>I have four children.</v>

2952
01:24:05.260 --> 01:24:06.093
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2953
01:24:06.150 --> 01:24:06.631
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>

2954
01:24:06.631 --> 01:24:08.340
<v Speaker 3>I choose not to spend the time,</v>

2955
01:24:08.341 --> 01:24:08.511
<v Speaker 3>do I?</v>

2956
01:24:08.511 --> 01:24:09.180
<v Speaker 3>I will.</v>

2957
01:24:09.180 --> 01:24:09.871
<v Speaker 3>I have a fan club.</v>

2958
01:24:09.871 --> 01:24:12.990
<v Speaker 3>I have a whole group of people that that work for me that do that,</v>

2959
01:24:13.090 --> 01:24:15.690
<v Speaker 3>so I stay in that arena,</v>

2960
01:24:15.691 --> 01:24:17.100
<v Speaker 3>but I know I can't.</v>

2961
01:24:17.340 --> 01:24:20.550
<v Speaker 3>But do people think that it's you because you have a verified account?</v>

2962
01:24:20.551 --> 01:24:21.720
<v Speaker 3>I always tell them there's not me.</v>

2963
01:24:21.780 --> 01:24:22.600
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2964
01:24:22.600 --> 01:24:23.850
<v Speaker 3>it's definitely my people.</v>

2965
01:24:23.880 --> 01:24:24.880
<v Speaker 3>I can make,</v>

2966
01:24:24.980 --> 01:24:25.230
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2967
01:24:25.230 --> 01:24:27.210
<v Speaker 3>I can make a statement.</v>

2968
01:24:27.240 --> 01:24:30.660
<v Speaker 3>I will go to my Twitter and I will go to my website and I would go this and you</v>

2969
01:24:30.661 --> 01:24:31.530
<v Speaker 3>can count on that.</v>

2970
01:24:31.531 --> 01:24:33.120
<v Speaker 3>If it says Melissa Eppich says this,</v>

2971
01:24:33.510 --> 01:24:34.380
<v Speaker 3>that you can count that.</v>

2972
01:24:34.381 --> 01:24:35.214
<v Speaker 3>That's what it is.</v>

2973
01:24:35.250 --> 01:24:36.051
<v Speaker 3>That I did say it.</v>

2974
01:24:36.051 --> 01:24:36.200
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2975
01:24:36.200 --> 01:24:36.600
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

2976
01:24:36.600 --> 01:24:40.070
<v Speaker 1>the only problem that I would say is that on your Twitter,</v>

2977
01:24:40.071 --> 01:24:41.030
<v Speaker 1>when you go there,</v>

2978
01:24:41.240 --> 01:24:44.930
<v Speaker 1>it looks like your responding to things to spine,</v>

2979
01:24:44.931 --> 01:24:49.010
<v Speaker 1>to people because someone is doing it through your verified Twitter and they're</v>

2980
01:24:49.011 --> 01:24:49.611
<v Speaker 1>not saying,</v>

2981
01:24:49.611 --> 01:24:49.821
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

2982
01:24:49.821 --> 01:24:50.960
<v Speaker 1>this isn't Melissa.</v>

2983
01:24:51.110 --> 01:24:51.920
<v Speaker 3>Ah,</v>

2984
01:24:51.920 --> 01:24:52.220
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2985
01:24:52.220 --> 01:24:53.210
<v Speaker 3>Like a lot of responding.</v>

2986
01:24:53.450 --> 01:24:55.880
<v Speaker 3>Britney spears and stuff like that did the same thing,</v>

2987
01:24:55.881 --> 01:24:57.800
<v Speaker 3>but when every time they actually do it,</v>

2988
01:24:57.801 --> 01:24:58.760
<v Speaker 3>they didn't know who gives you.</v>

2989
01:24:58.761 --> 01:25:00.860
<v Speaker 3>They do like dash B a s you know,</v>

2990
01:25:00.861 --> 01:25:01.790
<v Speaker 3>like meaning like it's her.</v>

2991
01:25:01.791 --> 01:25:02.210
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2992
01:25:02.210 --> 01:25:02.901
<v Speaker 3>There's a little hill,</v>

2993
01:25:02.901 --> 01:25:03.141
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2994
01:25:03.141 --> 01:25:03.931
<v Speaker 3>Like teams,</v>

2995
01:25:03.931 --> 01:25:05.810
<v Speaker 3>someone or another doing this.</v>

2996
01:25:05.830 --> 01:25:05.990
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2997
01:25:05.990 --> 01:25:07.790
<v Speaker 3>I think I'll have to go to my team and say,</v>

2998
01:25:07.791 --> 01:25:08.360
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

2999
01:25:08.360 --> 01:25:09.081

3003
01:25:13.010 --> 01:25:13.341
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

3004
01:25:13.341 --> 01:25:14.230
<v Speaker 1>what'd you got a team for?</v>

01:25:24.770 --> 01:25:25.310
<v Speaker 1>It's fun.</v>

3013
01:25:25.310 --> 01:25:27.560
<v Speaker 1>It's fun to write like little things on hundred 40 characters,</v>

3014
01:25:27.561 --> 01:25:31.490
<v Speaker 1>but it's also important to be able to keep in contact with people like that.</v>

3015
01:25:31.700 --> 01:25:32.630
<v Speaker 1>You don't do anything like that?</v>

3016
01:25:33.170 --> 01:25:33.500
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

3017
01:25:33.500 --> 01:25:34.333
<v Speaker 1>It's too much.</v>

3018
01:25:34.690 --> 01:25:37.220
<v Speaker 1>I just don't just don't want to spend the time to do it.</v>

3019
01:25:37.280 --> 01:25:37.950
<v Speaker 1>I just don't.</v>

3020
01:25:37.950 --> 01:25:38.783
<v Speaker 1>It just not,</v>

3021
01:25:39.180 --> 01:25:40.110
<v Speaker 1>it's not in my wheel,</v>

3022
01:25:40.111 --> 01:25:40.371
<v Speaker 1>but yeah.</v>

3023
01:25:40.371 --> 01:25:41.720
<v Speaker 1>I don't want people to know that much about me.</v>

3024
01:25:41.721 --> 01:25:42.890
<v Speaker 1>They know way too much anyway.</v>

3025
01:25:43.070 --> 01:25:47.230
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it weird that they just want to find so much about Dan [inaudible]</v>

3026
01:25:47.570 --> 01:25:48.081
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>

3027
01:25:48.081 --> 01:25:48.321
<v Speaker 1>I am.</v>

3028
01:25:48.321 --> 01:25:50.690
<v Speaker 1>So it's not even that.</v>

3029
01:25:50.720 --> 01:25:51.110
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>

3030
01:25:51.110 --> 01:25:53.270
<v Speaker 1>it's just they fixate and just decide.</v>

3031
01:25:53.630 --> 01:25:54.650
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to look at themselves.</v>

3032
01:25:54.710 --> 01:25:55.543
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3033
01:25:56.030 --> 01:25:57.410

3034
01:25:57.750 --> 01:26:00.480
<v Speaker 3>What was your a Woodstock performance like?</v>

3035
01:26:00.510 --> 01:26:02.240
<v Speaker 3>That was one of my favorite shows,</v>

3036
01:26:02.340 --> 01:26:03.173
<v Speaker 3>four 90.</v>

3037

3040
01:26:08.550 --> 01:26:10.520
<v Speaker 3>what was that like being in that situation?</v>

3041
01:26:11.120 --> 01:26:11.960
<v Speaker 3>It was crazy one,</v>

3042
01:26:11.961 --> 01:26:16.940
<v Speaker 3>cause it was the 25th anniversary and they hadn't got back together to do this.</v>

3043
01:26:16.941 --> 01:26:17.480
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

3044
01:26:17.480 --> 01:26:19.760

3046
01:26:21.110 --> 01:26:21.890
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

01:26:21.890 --> 01:26:24.110
<v Speaker 3>a car to a bus that drove to,</v>

3048
01:26:24.111 --> 01:26:24.800

3052
01:26:30.621 --> 01:26:34.730
<v Speaker 3>that to a van that took us to the backstage.</v>

3053
01:26:34.731 --> 01:26:35.564
<v Speaker 3>It was crazy.</v>

3054
01:26:35.810 --> 01:26:36.250
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

3055
01:26:36.250 --> 01:26:38.420
<v Speaker 3>and I remember Joe Cocker opening the,</v>

3056
01:26:38.421 --> 01:26:39.050
<v Speaker 3>the day that,</v>

3057
01:26:39.050 --> 01:26:41.210
<v Speaker 3>that I've played and I was on stage and you know,</v>

3058
01:26:41.470 --> 01:26:42.740
<v Speaker 3>get by with little help from my friends.</v>

3059
01:26:42.741 --> 01:26:42.981
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

3060
01:26:42.981 --> 01:26:43.131
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3061
01:26:43.131 --> 01:26:43.964
<v Speaker 3>this is awesome.</v>

3062
01:26:44.230 --> 01:26:44.871
<v Speaker 3>And it was really,</v>

3063
01:26:44.871 --> 01:26:45.810
<v Speaker 3>really wonderful.</v>

3064
01:26:45.920 --> 01:26:48.800
<v Speaker 3>They put me in between Henry Rollins and nine inch nails.</v>

3065
01:26:49.400 --> 01:26:50.233
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>

3066
01:26:50.840 --> 01:26:52.520
<v Speaker 3>And it rained during Henry Rollins.</v>

3067
01:26:52.910 --> 01:26:54.320
<v Speaker 3>So my,</v>

3068
01:26:54.380 --> 01:26:55.191
<v Speaker 3>my show,</v>

3069
01:26:55.191 --> 01:26:56.210
<v Speaker 3>the sun came out as beautiful.</v>

3070
01:26:56.480 --> 01:26:57.530
<v Speaker 4>You manifested that?</v>

3071
01:26:58.220 --> 01:27:00.470
<v Speaker 4>I'm at the first rounds fucked up.</v>

3072
01:27:00.471 --> 01:27:05.471
<v Speaker 4>You got all negative [inaudible] I know you're not going to blame them.</v>

3073
01:27:07.140 --> 01:27:08.190
<v Speaker 4>That's why I'm here to blame.</v>

3074
01:27:09.430 --> 01:27:10.200
<v Speaker 4>And I liked him.</v>

3075
01:27:10.200 --> 01:27:10.830
<v Speaker 4>I liked him.</v>

3076
01:27:10.830 --> 01:27:11.663
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

3077
01:27:12.640 --> 01:27:16.120
<v Speaker 3>I like a lot of boy that guy is so I got to play and the audience was great.</v>

3078
01:27:16.121 --> 01:27:18.620
<v Speaker 3>There was a bit of marsh and going on in front of me that kind of scared me if</v>

3079
01:27:18.640 --> 01:27:19.070
<v Speaker 3>people like,</v>

3080
01:27:19.070 --> 01:27:20.650
<v Speaker 3>oh look at that.</v>

3081
01:27:20.651 --> 01:27:22.360
<v Speaker 3>Yeah it was great.</v>

3082
01:27:23.650 --> 01:27:25.110
<v Speaker 3>My last song I've played like the way do,</v>

3083
01:27:25.120 --> 01:27:26.440
<v Speaker 3>yeah there's the mud people.</v>

3084
01:27:26.830 --> 01:27:30.280
<v Speaker 3>They started because it had just rained and I could see this patch of,</v>

3085
01:27:30.880 --> 01:27:31.571
<v Speaker 3>of gray,</v>

3086
01:27:31.571 --> 01:27:32.850
<v Speaker 3>Brown way far.</v>

3087
01:27:32.860 --> 01:27:35.110
<v Speaker 3>I mean I couldn't see the end of the,</v>

3088
01:27:35.470 --> 01:27:36.303
<v Speaker 3>the audience.</v>

3089
01:27:36.460 --> 01:27:40.270
<v Speaker 3>And so I'm looking at all of a sudden that patch kind of turns into a snake and</v>

3090
01:27:40.271 --> 01:27:42.700
<v Speaker 3>they all start coming toward the stage and everyone's like moving out of the</v>

3091
01:27:42.701 --> 01:27:42.791
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>

3092
01:27:42.791 --> 01:27:45.010
<v Speaker 3>Cause it's all these completely muddy people from head to toe.</v>

3093
01:27:45.011 --> 01:27:45.900
<v Speaker 3>It was Brian show that.</v>

3094
01:27:45.910 --> 01:27:46.743
<v Speaker 3>So that again,</v>

3095
01:27:47.080 --> 01:27:49.000
<v Speaker 3>that's a real first world problem.</v>

3096
01:27:49.030 --> 01:27:49.421
<v Speaker 3>A bunch of,</v>

3097
01:27:49.421 --> 01:27:49.720
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

3098
01:27:49.720 --> 01:27:54.720
<v Speaker 4>People muddy or mud because white people are so silly and their decisions to get</v>

3099
01:27:55.591 --> 01:27:56.010
<v Speaker 4>muddy.</v>

3100
01:27:56.010 --> 01:27:57.060
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

3101
01:27:57.540 --> 01:27:59.400
<v Speaker 4>That was black people like fucking concerts.</v>

3102
01:27:59.401 --> 01:28:00.430
<v Speaker 4>Cancel pitch.</v>

3103
01:28:01.890 --> 01:28:02.131
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

3104
01:28:02.131 --> 01:28:02.970
<v Speaker 4>I'm outta here.</v>

3105
01:28:04.290 --> 01:28:06.900
<v Speaker 4>I could've called Marsha if it was all black girls.</v>

3106
01:28:07.020 --> 01:28:08.650
<v Speaker 4>How many black girls you think it would be there?</v>

3107
01:28:09.170 --> 01:28:09.590
<v Speaker 4>The hair,</v>

3108
01:28:09.590 --> 01:28:10.423
<v Speaker 4>hair,</v>

3109
01:28:10.680 --> 01:28:13.590
<v Speaker 4>fucking high heels and stepping in the mud pinch and shows over.</v>

3110
01:28:13.740 --> 01:28:16.560
<v Speaker 4>It takes dopey white people to be slamming into each other.</v>

3111
01:28:17.040 --> 01:28:17.873
<v Speaker 4>That's us.</v>

3112
01:28:18.440 --> 01:28:19.273
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3113
01:28:19.500 --> 01:28:20.580
<v Speaker 4>White people will get muddy.</v>

3114
01:28:20.910 --> 01:28:23.490
<v Speaker 4>They get crazy and that the whole matching thing,</v>

<v Speaker 4>You crazy asshole.</v>

3120
01:28:32.610 --> 01:28:36.000
<v Speaker 4>One guy jumped up on my stage and go to dive off and everyone just moved and he</v>

3137
01:29:04.361 --> 01:29:07.580
<v Speaker 4>It was choice and see a Dick Wad the universe trying to end them.</v>

01:29:16.600 --> 01:29:17.170
<v Speaker 4>What do you,</v>

3154
01:29:25.781 --> 01:29:26.050
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3155
01:29:26.050 --> 01:29:27.580
<v Speaker 3>that's near the balance.</v>

3156
01:29:28.030 --> 01:29:33.030
<v Speaker 3>I understand that through this horrific act that the outpouring of goodwill,</v>

3157
01:29:37.150 --> 01:29:38.500
<v Speaker 3>the outpouring of weight,</v>

3158
01:29:38.520 --> 01:29:39.490
<v Speaker 3>but we have to do something.</v>

3159
01:29:39.491 --> 01:29:39.951
<v Speaker 3>Not only,</v>

3160
01:29:39.951 --> 01:29:40.784
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3161
01:29:40.870 --> 01:29:42.490
<v Speaker 3>I mean I'm not going to get the gun control thing.</v>

3162
01:29:42.520 --> 01:29:45.340
<v Speaker 3>I think it's beyond that to the people,</v>

3163
01:29:45.400 --> 01:29:45.971
<v Speaker 3>the person,</v>

3164
01:29:45.971 --> 01:29:50.020
<v Speaker 3>a person that can be in so much pain that they can walk in and do that.</v>

3165
01:29:50.021 --> 01:29:50.320
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

3166
01:29:50.320 --> 01:29:52.120
<v Speaker 3>that's a lot of pain.</v>

3167
01:29:52.600 --> 01:29:57.600
<v Speaker 3>Let's look at what leads are human beings of our society to that sort of pain</v>

3168
01:29:58.661 --> 01:29:59.950
<v Speaker 3>without anyone noticing.</v>

3169
01:30:00.790 --> 01:30:01.061
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3170
01:30:01.061 --> 01:30:02.110
<v Speaker 3>But wouldn't you have to say that he,</v>

3171
01:30:02.500 --> 01:30:03.980
<v Speaker 3>he asked for that wouldn't,</v>

3172
01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:05.410
<v Speaker 3>I mean with your field philosophy,</v>

3173
01:30:05.411 --> 01:30:06.460
<v Speaker 3>he created this idea.</v>

3174
01:30:06.490 --> 01:30:07.070
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

3175
01:30:07.070 --> 01:30:12.070
<v Speaker 3>I imagine his pain was so great that the only way to unload it was to spray that</v>

3176
01:30:15.281 --> 01:30:18.940
<v Speaker 3>much pain around [inaudible] and the pain,</v>

3177
01:30:19.090 --> 01:30:21.160
<v Speaker 3>it becomes all encompassing.</v>

3178
01:30:21.161 --> 01:30:21.521
<v Speaker 3>And of course,</v>

3179
01:30:21.521 --> 01:30:21.701
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3180
01:30:21.701 --> 01:30:23.950
<v Speaker 3>you just fall into it and of course you just going to end your own life.</v>

3181
01:30:23.950 --> 01:30:24.940
<v Speaker 3>It's like game over.</v>

3182
01:30:24.941 --> 01:30:28.810
<v Speaker 3>It's like tilt or how do you factor in like psychosis and things along those</v>

3183
01:30:28.811 --> 01:30:30.400
<v Speaker 3>lines of real mental issues,</v>

3184
01:30:31.840 --> 01:30:32.800
<v Speaker 3>real mental issues.</v>

3185
01:30:33.010 --> 01:30:35.470
<v Speaker 3>It depends on how you look at what,</v>

3186
01:30:36.910 --> 01:30:40.690
<v Speaker 3>just because something is not the way you and I perceive.</v>

3187
01:30:40.691 --> 01:30:41.524
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

3188
01:30:41.890 --> 01:30:44.560
<v Speaker 3>this is sane and that's crazy.</v>

3189
01:30:44.620 --> 01:30:45.453
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

3190
01:30:45.460 --> 01:30:46.690
<v Speaker 3>Real mental issues.</v>

3191
01:30:46.900 --> 01:30:51.900
<v Speaker 3>Where's the line drawn me the line where your thoughts become psychosis.</v>

3192
01:30:52.660 --> 01:30:53.050
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3193
01:30:53.050 --> 01:30:53.531
<v Speaker 3>And where is it?</v>

3194
01:30:53.531 --> 01:30:54.730
<v Speaker 3>The resume spectrum?</v>

3195
01:30:55.300 --> 01:30:56.133
<v Speaker 3>Is it broad?</v>

3196
01:30:56.190 --> 01:30:56.890
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3197
01:30:56.890 --> 01:30:57.910
<v Speaker 3>It's just the,</v>

3198
01:30:57.911 --> 01:30:58.600
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>

3199
01:30:58.600 --> 01:31:01.300
<v Speaker 3>it's been vibrating that much more.</v>

3200
01:31:01.301 --> 01:31:04.720
<v Speaker 3>And so you are so far out of it that we call it psychosis,</v>

3201
01:31:04.990 --> 01:31:07.600
<v Speaker 3>but there are some people that do not have an emotional connection to other</v>

3202
01:31:07.601 --> 01:31:08.060
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

3203
01:31:08.060 --> 01:31:10.330
<v Speaker 3>They don't feel remorse indeed.</v>

3204
01:31:10.460 --> 01:31:10.990
<v Speaker 3>That,</v>

3205
01:31:10.990 --> 01:31:12.370
<v Speaker 3>that you look at that and go,</v>

3206
01:31:12.371 --> 01:31:13.204
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

3207
01:31:13.480 --> 01:31:13.990
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

3208
01:31:13.990 --> 01:31:15.580
<v Speaker 3>what is their intention here?</v>

3209
01:31:15.581 --> 01:31:16.450
<v Speaker 3>What is there?</v>

3210
01:31:16.900 --> 01:31:17.940
<v Speaker 3>What do they need to draw?</v>

3211
01:31:18.480 --> 01:31:18.790
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3212
01:31:18.790 --> 01:31:23.790
<v Speaker 3>who knows what they are intending and creating given that it's like,</v>

3213
01:31:26.801 --> 01:31:27.161
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

3214
01:31:27.161 --> 01:31:28.640
<v Speaker 3>you're gonna go back into this,</v>

3215
01:31:28.710 --> 01:31:30.100
<v Speaker 3>the biosphere called Earth,</v>

3216
01:31:30.430 --> 01:31:33.040
<v Speaker 3>you're going to go in there and we're going to this,</v>

3217
01:31:33.041 --> 01:31:34.090
<v Speaker 3>this is your handicap.</v>

3218
01:31:34.420 --> 01:31:39.420
<v Speaker 3>You can't feel a thing because it now now work through that.</v>

3219
01:31:40.750 --> 01:31:41.800
<v Speaker 3>How do you work through that?</v>

3220
01:31:41.890 --> 01:31:43.570
<v Speaker 4>How do you have any feelings?</v>

3221
01:31:43.571 --> 01:31:47.860
<v Speaker 4>I mean the idea of not having any feelings and lashing out is a big difference</v>

3222
01:31:47.861 --> 01:31:52.330
<v Speaker 4>between the idea of just not having any feelings without the need for inflicting</v>

3223
01:31:52.331 --> 01:31:53.440
<v Speaker 4>pain on other people.</v>

3224
01:31:53.590 --> 01:31:53.861
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>

3225
01:31:53.861 --> 01:31:55.210
<v Speaker 4>it seems to be a dual issue.</v>

3226
01:31:55.211 --> 01:31:58.120
<v Speaker 4>It seems to be an issue of not being able to feel it</v>

3227
01:31:58.740 --> 01:31:59.200
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

3228
01:31:59.200 --> 01:32:00.033
<v Speaker 1>of them,</v>

3229
01:32:00.040 --> 01:32:00.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3230
01:32:00.400 --> 01:32:01.960
<v Speaker 1>and also the anger.</v>

3231
01:32:02.230 --> 01:32:02.911
<v Speaker 1>And the,</v>

3232
01:32:02.911 --> 01:32:03.370
<v Speaker 1>the meat,</v>

3233
01:32:03.370 --> 01:32:06.070
<v Speaker 1>the want and the desire to hurt</v>

3234
01:32:06.300 --> 01:32:09.930
<v Speaker 3>the belief that if they don't hurt something,</v>

3235
01:32:10.230 --> 01:32:11.490
<v Speaker 3>they're going to hurt more.</v>

3236
01:32:11.860 --> 01:32:16.180
<v Speaker 1>It seems like with this way of thinking that if you,</v>

3237
01:32:16.210 --> 01:32:17.043
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3238
01:32:17.410 --> 01:32:18.243
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

3239
01:32:18.250 --> 01:32:23.250
<v Speaker 1>if you got more people to sort of a look at it that way and more people to do,</v>

3240
01:32:23.831 --> 01:32:26.150
<v Speaker 1>do you think that that would be like an empowering thing?</v>

3241
01:32:26.230 --> 01:32:26.800
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3242
01:32:26.800 --> 01:32:27.610
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

3243
01:32:27.610 --> 01:32:28.450
<v Speaker 3>it's the,</v>

3244
01:32:28.480 --> 01:32:33.280
<v Speaker 3>it's the point in which you see that piece is okay,</v>

3245
01:32:33.281 --> 01:32:34.210
<v Speaker 3>I need to,</v>

3246
01:32:34.720 --> 01:32:34.991
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

3247
01:32:34.991 --> 01:32:36.880
<v Speaker 3>you might've thrown the last rock,</v>

3248
01:32:36.881 --> 01:32:38.320
<v Speaker 3>you might have shot the last bullet,</v>

3249
01:32:39.160 --> 01:32:40.510
<v Speaker 3>but I need to be willing to go,</v>

3250
01:32:40.720 --> 01:32:41.140
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3251
01:32:41.140 --> 01:32:41.770
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

3252
01:32:41.770 --> 01:32:43.780
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to shoot back.</v>

3253
01:32:43.930 --> 01:32:46.660
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to start a different reaction.</v>

3254
01:32:47.620 --> 01:32:52.620
<v Speaker 3>So if you get enough people who believe that</v>

3255
01:32:54.320 --> 01:32:59.320
<v Speaker 3>and believe that if I take care of myself that nothing bad is gonna happen to me</v>

3256
01:33:01.691 --> 01:33:02.524
<v Speaker 3>that I don't,</v>

3257
01:33:02.860 --> 01:33:06.090
<v Speaker 3>that I can't handle because I'm not saying the world is all good a,</v>

3258
01:33:06.100 --> 01:33:09.070
<v Speaker 3>it's about understanding your balance and what you asked for and walking through</v>

3259
01:33:09.071 --> 01:33:09.904
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

3260
01:33:10.060 --> 01:33:15.060
<v Speaker 3>If I can hold that and not blame anybody else and nobody else is going to blame</v>

3261
01:33:15.341 --> 01:33:16.000
<v Speaker 3>me,</v>

3262
01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:17.470
<v Speaker 3>then we start walking.</v>

3263
01:33:17.830 --> 01:33:19.630
<v Speaker 3>We start moving to a future.</v>

3264
01:33:19.631 --> 01:33:21.850
<v Speaker 3>That is all of a sudden you don't need prisons.</v>

3265
01:33:22.420 --> 01:33:23.590
<v Speaker 3>All of a sudden you don't need,</v>

3266
01:33:24.100 --> 01:33:24.933
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3267
01:33:25.330 --> 01:33:29.620
<v Speaker 3>all of a sudden the way we govern ourselves completely changes.</v>

3268
01:33:29.890 --> 01:33:31.550
<v Speaker 1>You got to catch people in a very,</v>

3269
01:33:31.551 --> 01:33:31.881
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

3270
01:33:31.881 --> 01:33:35.570
<v Speaker 1>very early age and sort of manifest this type of behavior.</v>

3271
01:33:35.810 --> 01:33:37.730
<v Speaker 1>You have to get them when they're young,</v>

3272
01:33:37.731 --> 01:33:42.731
<v Speaker 1>expose them to nothing but love and curiosity and curiosity with joy.</v>

3273
01:33:43.580 --> 01:33:44.450
<v Speaker 1>Why did they think you're crazy?</v>

3274
01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:45.771
<v Speaker 3>Call that Voodoo dog.</v>

3275
01:33:45.771 --> 01:33:46.700
<v Speaker 3>Cause it is different.</v>

3276
01:33:46.730 --> 01:33:47.181
<v Speaker 3>That's what I said.</v>

3277
01:33:47.181 --> 01:33:47.271
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

3278
01:33:47.271 --> 01:33:49.970
<v Speaker 3>oh mom stopped at Voodoo stuff but they will believe it when it called Buddha.</v>

3279
01:33:50.030 --> 01:33:50.151
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3280
01:33:50.151 --> 01:33:51.110
<v Speaker 3>they do that.</v>

3281
01:33:51.130 --> 01:33:51.710
<v Speaker 3>Moody's Dough.</v>

3282
01:33:51.710 --> 01:33:52.850
<v Speaker 3>How long have you been talking to Buddha?</v>

3283
01:33:53.090 --> 01:33:53.331
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3284
01:33:53.331 --> 01:33:54.220
<v Speaker 3>it's been about eight years now.</v>

3285
01:33:54.250 --> 01:33:54.711
<v Speaker 3>Eight years.</v>

3286
01:33:54.711 --> 01:33:55.544
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3287
01:33:55.890 --> 01:33:57.680
<v Speaker 3>But I can constantly go,</v>

3288
01:33:58.040 --> 01:33:58.401
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

3289
01:33:58.401 --> 01:33:59.750
<v Speaker 3>you saw that choice you made.</v>

3290
01:34:00.110 --> 01:34:01.760
<v Speaker 3>This is the result of that choice.</v>

3291
01:34:01.761 --> 01:34:02.900
<v Speaker 3>This is not anybody else.</v>

3292
01:34:02.901 --> 01:34:04.520
<v Speaker 3>It's not anybody's doing anything to you.</v>

3293
01:34:05.040 --> 01:34:06.330
<v Speaker 1>So there is no randomness.</v>

3294
01:34:06.331 --> 01:34:08.520
<v Speaker 1>You think so people that are in like the tower,</v>

3295
01:34:08.521 --> 01:34:09.390
<v Speaker 1>when the plane hits,</v>

3296
01:34:09.391 --> 01:34:09.671
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

3297
01:34:09.671 --> 01:34:12.810
<v Speaker 1>they made a choice somehow in the world to be in that spot.</v>

3298
01:34:14.030 --> 01:34:15.680
<v Speaker 3>If you can look at it without blame,</v>

3299
01:34:15.920 --> 01:34:16.340
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3300
01:34:16.340 --> 01:34:19.610
<v Speaker 3>If you can look at the day that that was what they signed up for,</v>

3301
01:34:19.611 --> 01:34:21.320
<v Speaker 3>they wanted to be in it for that long.</v>

3302
01:34:21.380 --> 01:34:21.531
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

3303
01:34:21.531 --> 01:34:22.340
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3304
01:34:22.340 --> 01:34:25.200
<v Speaker 3>I can't tell this to someone who lost their loved one.</v>

3305
01:34:25.480 --> 01:34:26.260
<v Speaker 3>They're going to,</v>

3306
01:34:26.260 --> 01:34:28.340
<v Speaker 3>that's not going to sound yet.</v>

3307
01:34:29.030 --> 01:34:32.480
<v Speaker 3>My belief is founded on that.</v>

3308
01:34:32.481 --> 01:34:35.840
<v Speaker 3>I can't blame anybody else for anything,</v>

3309
01:34:37.020 --> 01:34:41.520
<v Speaker 1>but it's also founded on the idea that you're creating this sort of reality that</v>

3310
01:34:41.521 --> 01:34:44.700
<v Speaker 1>you exist in and that everybody's creating their own reality.</v>

3311
01:34:44.890 --> 01:34:45.130
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

3312
01:34:45.130 --> 01:34:45.731
<v Speaker 3>if I work,</v>

3313
01:34:45.731 --> 01:34:48.160
<v Speaker 3>if I make my little Hologram,</v>

3314
01:34:48.161 --> 01:34:50.050
<v Speaker 3>my little fractal of the Hologram,</v>

3315
01:34:50.051 --> 01:34:51.970
<v Speaker 3>if I work in making that the best I can,</v>

3316
01:34:52.390 --> 01:34:55.480
<v Speaker 3>it's fill it with as much love and as little fear as possible.</v>

3317
01:34:56.470 --> 01:35:00.170
<v Speaker 3>Then I helped whole picture because the whole picture has me in it.</v>

3318
01:35:00.570 --> 01:35:02.040
<v Speaker 1>I look at it as a,</v>

3319
01:35:02.100 --> 01:35:02.520
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3320
01:35:02.520 --> 01:35:03.020
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

3321
01:35:03.020 --> 01:35:04.590
<v Speaker 1>I don't have an opinion one way or another,</v>

3322
01:35:04.620 --> 01:35:09.330
<v Speaker 1>but I do look at it often that it's a combination of that and scientific</v>

3323
01:35:09.331 --> 01:35:10.164
<v Speaker 1>reality.</v>

3324
01:35:10.170 --> 01:35:13.170
<v Speaker 1>Like I think that if the super volcano goes,</v>

3325
01:35:13.380 --> 01:35:15.360
<v Speaker 1>we're all fucked no matter what you believe.</v>

3326
01:35:15.450 --> 01:35:16.350
<v Speaker 1>I do believe that.</v>

3327
01:35:16.351 --> 01:35:21.351
<v Speaker 1>But I do believe that there's also a real possibility that your thoughts are</v>

3328
01:35:22.261 --> 01:35:26.700
<v Speaker 1>creating a good portion of your reality and your thoughts interacting with other</v>

3329
01:35:26.701 --> 01:35:29.220
<v Speaker 1>people are actually responsible for culture in the first place.</v>

3330
01:35:29.250 --> 01:35:31.170
<v Speaker 1>And that's how decisions get made.</v>

3331
01:35:31.171 --> 01:35:33.390
<v Speaker 1>Conversations have taken place,</v>

3332
01:35:33.420 --> 01:35:34.560
<v Speaker 1>letters get written,</v>

3333
01:35:34.800 --> 01:35:35.640
<v Speaker 1>books get written.</v>

3334
01:35:35.670 --> 01:35:36.690
<v Speaker 1>That's how it all happens.</v>

3335
01:35:36.691 --> 01:35:39.000
<v Speaker 1>It happens through your mind,</v>

3336
01:35:39.180 --> 01:35:42.690
<v Speaker 1>interacting with other people and literally changing things in a very physical</v>

3337
01:35:42.691 --> 01:35:43.950
<v Speaker 1>form that everybody agrees on.</v>

3338
01:35:44.130 --> 01:35:46.710
<v Speaker 1>But I think that even besides that,</v>

3339
01:35:46.950 --> 01:35:48.570
<v Speaker 1>I think there's other issues going on.</v>

3340
01:35:48.571 --> 01:35:52.380
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a lot more ethereal than we give them credit for.</v>

3341
01:35:52.381 --> 01:35:53.640
<v Speaker 1>It's very strange.</v>

3342
01:35:54.010 --> 01:35:56.380
<v Speaker 3>I'm just trying to walk every day,</v>

3343
01:35:56.470 --> 01:35:57.303
<v Speaker 3>just walk.</v>

3344
01:35:57.850 --> 01:35:59.980
<v Speaker 3>Asteroids will fuck your world up.</v>

3345
01:36:00.120 --> 01:36:01.870
<v Speaker 3>And that shit is real,</v>

3346
01:36:02.860 --> 01:36:03.300
<v Speaker 1>real.</v>

3347
01:36:03.300 --> 01:36:04.133
<v Speaker 1>His ice cream,</v>

3348
01:36:04.510 --> 01:36:07.990
<v Speaker 1>they come down and that's a wrap sign and there's nothing he could do about it.</v>

3349
01:36:07.991 --> 01:36:09.100
<v Speaker 1>And there's a lot of them out there.</v>

3350
01:36:09.220 --> 01:36:10.070
<v Speaker 1>I think that too.</v>

3351
01:36:10.390 --> 01:36:11.740
<v Speaker 1>I think you create your reality,</v>

3352
01:36:11.741 --> 01:36:14.680
<v Speaker 1>but I also think that there's some random shit that I didn't sign up for.</v>

3353
01:36:15.040 --> 01:36:16.060
<v Speaker 1>If it was up to me,</v>

3354
01:36:16.061 --> 01:36:17.710
<v Speaker 1>there would be no asteroids.</v>

3355
01:36:17.711 --> 01:36:18.041
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3356
01:36:18.041 --> 01:36:18.930
<v Speaker 1>I would work that out.</v>

3357
01:36:19.200 --> 01:36:20.080
<v Speaker 1>I'd figure it out.</v>

3358
01:36:20.530 --> 01:36:21.110
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like that.</v>

3359
01:36:21.110 --> 01:36:24.460
<v Speaker 1>It's gotta be one fucked up way to go with is a big light in the sky for three</v>

3360
01:36:24.461 --> 01:36:26.230
<v Speaker 1>days until finally,</v>

3361
01:36:26.260 --> 01:36:27.093
<v Speaker 1>boom.</v>

3362
01:36:27.950 --> 01:36:28.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3363
01:36:28.600 --> 01:36:29.620
<v Speaker 1>I'm not really into that.</v>

3364
01:36:31.930 --> 01:36:32.890
<v Speaker 1>That was not my idea.</v>

3365
01:36:33.120 --> 01:36:33.953
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure,</v>

3366
01:36:34.070 --> 01:36:34.960
<v Speaker 1>but I could be wrong.</v>

3367
01:36:35.050 --> 01:36:36.550
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I was a real mess.</v>

3368
01:36:36.800 --> 01:36:37.633
<v Speaker 1>Thinking about it though.</v>

3369
01:36:37.720 --> 01:36:38.410
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

3370
01:36:38.410 --> 01:36:39.130
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3371
01:36:39.130 --> 01:36:39.701
<v Speaker 1>I guess,</v>

3372
01:36:39.701 --> 01:36:44.230
<v Speaker 1>I mean if your correct than I do live in this world that's really nutty and</v>

3373
01:36:44.231 --> 01:36:45.700
<v Speaker 1>asteroids are there to keep you honest</v>

3374
01:36:46.760 --> 01:36:47.391
<v Speaker 3>or you could say,</v>

3375
01:36:47.391 --> 01:36:49.100
<v Speaker 3>I'm really grateful that I did that.</v>

3376
01:36:50.240 --> 01:36:52.670
<v Speaker 3>They were no asteroids that it was a perfectly uneventful day.</v>

3377
01:36:52.880 --> 01:36:55.520
<v Speaker 3>What other kind of crazy out there ideas do you have in your head?</v>

3378
01:36:55.550 --> 01:36:57.140
<v Speaker 3>Do you believe in alien contact?</v>

3379
01:36:57.141 --> 01:36:58.190
<v Speaker 3>Do you believe in anything like that?</v>

3380
01:36:58.400 --> 01:36:59.233
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3381
01:36:59.240 --> 01:37:00.230
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

3382
01:37:00.650 --> 01:37:03.410
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that there's like a whole race of people.</v>

3383
01:37:03.411 --> 01:37:03.770
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>

3384
01:37:03.770 --> 01:37:04.311
<v Speaker 3>Ooh,</v>

3385
01:37:04.311 --> 01:37:04.510
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3386
01:37:04.510 --> 01:37:05.331
<v Speaker 3>I'm from another planet,</v>

3387
01:37:05.331 --> 01:37:05.451
<v Speaker 3>blah,</v>

3388
01:37:05.451 --> 01:37:05.541
<v Speaker 3>blah,</v>

3389
01:37:05.541 --> 01:37:05.690
<v Speaker 3>blah.</v>

3390
01:37:05.690 --> 01:37:09.980
<v Speaker 3>I do believe in multidimensional reality and I believe that there are other</v>

3391
01:37:10.100 --> 01:37:15.100
<v Speaker 3>spiritual beings that live on that exist.</v>

3392
01:37:15.471 --> 01:37:19.250
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't say limb that exist on different planes and that,</v>

3393
01:37:19.251 --> 01:37:23.390
<v Speaker 3>that is where my spirit goes to when this,</v>

3394
01:37:23.550 --> 01:37:23.990
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3395
01:37:23.990 --> 01:37:25.400
<v Speaker 3>biological body dies.</v>

3396
01:37:25.820 --> 01:37:27.680
<v Speaker 3>I've tried pretend they're watching me all the time.</v>

3397
01:37:27.920 --> 01:37:28.511
<v Speaker 3>They lose me.</v>

3398
01:37:28.511 --> 01:37:29.344
<v Speaker 3>I'm steady.</v>

3399
01:37:29.830 --> 01:37:31.380
<v Speaker 3>It keeps me on the straight now.</v>

3400
01:37:32.620 --> 01:37:33.320
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3401
01:37:33.320 --> 01:37:33.681
<v Speaker 3>But no,</v>

3402
01:37:33.681 --> 01:37:34.210
<v Speaker 3>I'm not.</v>

3403
01:37:34.210 --> 01:37:34.790
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

3404
01:37:34.790 --> 01:37:35.070
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3405
01:37:35.070 --> 01:37:35.720
<v Speaker 3>you can,</v>

3406
01:37:35.720 --> 01:37:36.553
<v Speaker 3>you can.</v>

3407
01:37:37.700 --> 01:37:38.840
<v Speaker 3>I think everything's metaphor.</v>

3408
01:37:38.841 --> 01:37:43.841
<v Speaker 3>So I lost a lot of interest in aliens once I had a psychedelic experience.</v>

3409
01:37:43.931 --> 01:37:44.764
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

3410
01:37:44.930 --> 01:37:46.010
<v Speaker 3>The first DMT trip,</v>

3411
01:37:46.011 --> 01:37:49.010
<v Speaker 3>I had a really checked out the whole alien culture and was like,</v>

3412
01:37:49.011 --> 01:37:50.520
<v Speaker 3>you guys are missing the hole.</v>

3413
01:37:51.740 --> 01:37:52.670
<v Speaker 3>That's also what I,</v>

3414
01:37:52.680 --> 01:37:53.361
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

3415
01:37:53.361 --> 01:37:54.620
<v Speaker 3>it's not out there.</v>

3416
01:37:54.621 --> 01:37:55.454
<v Speaker 3>It's in</v>

3417
01:37:56.190 --> 01:38:01.190
<v Speaker 4>and tried to explain that to someone that if you have a Ufo landed on the White</v>

3418
01:38:01.680 --> 01:38:02.513
<v Speaker 4>House law,</v>

3419
01:38:03.030 --> 01:38:05.220
<v Speaker 4>just the White House lawn got out,</v>

3420
01:38:05.310 --> 01:38:06.990
<v Speaker 4>aliens got out and met the president,</v>

3421
01:38:07.050 --> 01:38:08.610
<v Speaker 4>gave him some new supercomputer.</v>

3422
01:38:08.880 --> 01:38:11.350
<v Speaker 4>It would be way less crazy than TMT.</v>

3423
01:38:11.580 --> 01:38:14.490
<v Speaker 4>Like NT is infinitely crazy than that.</v>

3424
01:38:14.491 --> 01:38:15.460
<v Speaker 4>And it's you.</v>

3425
01:38:15.600 --> 01:38:19.140
<v Speaker 4>It pushes you to see what are you believing?</v>

3426
01:38:19.740 --> 01:38:20.400
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3427
01:38:20.400 --> 01:38:24.810
<v Speaker 4>What's beyond this thing that you are so dead certain is reality.</v>

3428
01:38:25.140 --> 01:38:25.973
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3429
01:38:26.730 --> 01:38:28.860
<v Speaker 4>The deer head just fell over.</v>

3430
01:38:29.160 --> 01:38:29.951
<v Speaker 4>That's his reality.</v>

3431
01:38:29.951 --> 01:38:30.990
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

3432
01:38:32.100 --> 01:38:33.370
<v Speaker 4>That's powerful stuff.</v>

3433
01:38:33.720 --> 01:38:34.230
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3434
01:38:34.230 --> 01:38:34.920
<v Speaker 4>no kidding.</v>

3435
01:38:34.920 --> 01:38:35.611
<v Speaker 4>He got so excited.</v>

3436
01:38:35.611 --> 01:38:36.600
<v Speaker 4>You a pounded on wood.</v>

3437

3582
01:41:41.591 --> 01:41:43.490
<v Speaker 1>Just general in general.</v>

3583
01:41:43.720 --> 01:41:48.340
<v Speaker 1>This is more of an issue with the radiation of space actually scientifically.</v>

3584
01:41:48.820 --> 01:41:49.653
<v Speaker 1>That is,</v>

3585
01:41:49.660 --> 01:41:53.830
<v Speaker 1>if we believe what the numbers are that they say that those things,</v>

3586
01:41:53.860 --> 01:41:55.180
<v Speaker 1>those scanners give off,</v>

3587
01:41:55.510 --> 01:41:57.910
<v Speaker 1>but they say those are real risk of radiation.</v>

3588
01:41:57.911 --> 01:41:59.020
<v Speaker 1>Just actually flying,</v>

3589
01:41:59.440 --> 01:42:00.161
<v Speaker 1>just flying,</v>

3590
01:42:00.161 --> 01:42:01.310
<v Speaker 1>just being up in the air that high.</v>

3591
01:42:01.311 --> 01:42:02.950
<v Speaker 1>It's very a lot of radiation,</v>

3592
01:42:03.250 --> 01:42:03.431
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3593
01:42:03.431 --> 01:42:06.430
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of stuff week again can be afraid of.</v>

3594
01:42:06.520 --> 01:42:07.100
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

3595
01:42:07.100 --> 01:42:09.970
<v Speaker 1>I just believe I'm going to do the best I can.</v>

3596
01:42:09.971 --> 01:42:14.050
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to stay in the best possible shape I can be in.</v>

3597
01:42:14.140 --> 01:42:15.160
<v Speaker 1>Well that argument,</v>

3598
01:42:15.190 --> 01:42:15.491
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3599
01:42:15.491 --> 01:42:19.600
<v Speaker 1>that way of looking at things is what I've always argued was a good aspect of</v>

3600
01:42:19.601 --> 01:42:21.550
<v Speaker 1>religion with religion.</v>

3601
01:42:21.560 --> 01:42:21.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3602
01:42:21.790 --> 01:42:24.540
<v Speaker 1>Putting things in the faith of God and having this belief that it's all going to</v>

3603
01:42:24.541 --> 01:42:26.830
<v Speaker 1>work out even though it's sort of like,</v>

3604
01:42:27.040 --> 01:42:27.970
<v Speaker 1>in my opinion,</v>

3605
01:42:28.380 --> 01:42:29.213
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3606
01:42:29.700 --> 01:42:30.640
<v Speaker 1>I believe,</v>

3607
01:42:30.660 --> 01:42:30.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3608
01:42:30.850 --> 01:42:31.361
<v Speaker 1>people always say,</v>

3609
01:42:31.361 --> 01:42:33.370
<v Speaker 1>are you an atheist or an agnostic?</v>

3610
01:42:33.430 --> 01:42:36.310
<v Speaker 1>I believe people are full of shit first and foremost.</v>

3611
01:42:36.820 --> 01:42:39.100
<v Speaker 1>And that's always an issue whenever I hear a story.</v>

3612
01:42:39.430 --> 01:42:42.520
<v Speaker 1>So I look at every religion as a collection of stories.</v>

3613
01:42:42.670 --> 01:42:45.970
<v Speaker 1>Every religion has either a collection of stories or collection of rules that</v>

3614
01:42:45.971 --> 01:42:47.590
<v Speaker 1>came down from those collections stories.</v>

3615
01:42:48.070 --> 01:42:49.420
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's stories are bullshit.</v>

3616
01:42:49.480 --> 01:42:49.811
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

3617
01:42:49.811 --> 01:42:51.040
<v Speaker 1>So let's just put that out there.</v>

3618
01:42:51.430 --> 01:42:56.430
<v Speaker 1>Now I also believe that you believing in those stories and you believing in</v>

3619
01:42:56.861 --> 01:43:00.520
<v Speaker 1>God's love and you believing in doing God's will and you believing and being a</v>

3620
01:43:00.521 --> 01:43:04.300
<v Speaker 1>good God fearing person in the same way that I believe it's,</v>

3621
01:43:04.330 --> 01:43:04.601
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3622
01:43:04.601 --> 01:43:06.670
<v Speaker 1>I pretend that the interdimensional beings are watching me,</v>

3623
01:43:06.671 --> 01:43:07.560
<v Speaker 1>so it keeps me on the straight.</v>

3624
01:43:07.570 --> 01:43:09.040
<v Speaker 1>Now I think there's a,</v>

3625
01:43:09.041 --> 01:43:10.360
<v Speaker 1>there's a benefit to that.</v>

3626
01:43:10.361 --> 01:43:11.200
<v Speaker 1>There's a benefit to them.</v>

3627
01:43:11.201 --> 01:43:15.880
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's a correct way of approaching it rationally because I think</v>

3628
01:43:15.881 --> 01:43:18.670
<v Speaker 1>whatever merit is in the ancient texts,</v>

3629
01:43:18.671 --> 01:43:20.410
<v Speaker 1>whether it was actually the word of God,</v>

3630
01:43:20.411 --> 01:43:25.411
<v Speaker 1>it very well could be the huge issue is reading it at face value,</v>

3631
01:43:26.080 --> 01:43:28.680
<v Speaker 1>using it for uh,</v>

3632
01:43:28.720 --> 01:43:33.720
<v Speaker 1>like a framework for how you behave and act in this life when it's written</v>

3633
01:43:33.851 --> 01:43:38.290
<v Speaker 1>thousands of years ago by people with very limited access to information and all</v>

3634
01:43:38.291 --> 01:43:39.430
<v Speaker 1>of it is ridiculous.</v>

3635
01:43:40.060 --> 01:43:40.960
<v Speaker 1>It's all ridiculous.</v>

3636
01:43:41.730 --> 01:43:46.730
<v Speaker 1>And the desire to do good is a natural human state.</v>

3637
01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:50.820
<v Speaker 1>And to Eh,</v>

3638
01:43:50.860 --> 01:43:51.920
<v Speaker 1>to it with fear</v>

3639
01:43:51.980 --> 01:43:52.370
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

3640
01:43:52.370 --> 01:43:53.203
<v Speaker 3>is</v>

3641
01:43:53.260 --> 01:43:54.071
<v Speaker 1>unfortunate when,</v>

3642
01:43:54.071 --> 01:43:58.150
<v Speaker 1>when religious religion and that's right and yeah,</v>

3643
01:43:58.151 --> 01:44:00.820
<v Speaker 1>and you're not control when someone has power.</v>

3644
01:44:01.390 --> 01:44:02.860
<v Speaker 1>It's really simple.</v>

3645
01:44:02.861 --> 01:44:03.880
<v Speaker 1>It's just the same.</v>

3646
01:44:03.940 --> 01:44:06.580
<v Speaker 1>It's very similar to what we were talking about with actors losing their mind</v>

3647
01:44:06.581 --> 01:44:07.660
<v Speaker 1>when the beginning of my famous,</v>

3648
01:44:07.720 --> 01:44:08.140
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3649
01:44:08.140 --> 01:44:09.070
<v Speaker 1>it's almost similar.</v>

3650
01:44:09.071 --> 01:44:09.691
<v Speaker 1>It's like they,</v>

3651
01:44:09.691 --> 01:44:14.680
<v Speaker 1>they have crazy outfits on and they control the Vatican and so they are used to</v>

3652
01:44:14.681 --> 01:44:17.720
<v Speaker 1>everyone being terrified of them and freaking out and they're present works.</v>

3653
01:44:17.860 --> 01:44:18.820
<v Speaker 1>So they think they deserve it.</v>

3654
01:44:18.821 --> 01:44:19.150
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

3655
01:44:19.150 --> 01:44:22.540
<v Speaker 1>if I could get the pope on a podcast and the pope's book English,</v>

3656
01:44:22.570 --> 01:44:24.580
<v Speaker 1>it would be the most hilarious conversation ever.</v>

3657
01:44:24.960 --> 01:44:26.020
<v Speaker 1>He would never do it.</v>

3658
01:44:26.021 --> 01:44:26.854
<v Speaker 1>He would leave.</v>

3659
01:44:27.190 --> 01:44:29.140
<v Speaker 1>The moment we started talking about pedophilia,</v>

3660
01:44:29.141 --> 01:44:30.010
<v Speaker 1>he would probably run out right.</v>

3661
01:44:30.860 --> 01:44:31.740
<v Speaker 1>But the,</v>

3662
01:44:31.780 --> 01:44:36.780
<v Speaker 1>the idea that this guy is so completely sheltered and so completely revered</v>

3663
01:44:37.270 --> 01:44:41.680
<v Speaker 1>where he's just a guy with a wacky outfit on and that is it.</v>

3664
01:44:41.830 --> 01:44:42.850
<v Speaker 1>That really is it.</v>

3665
01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:46.510
<v Speaker 1>And this idol worship that was actually talked about in the Bible,</v>

3666
01:44:46.680 --> 01:44:46.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3667
01:44:46.890 --> 01:44:49.500
<v Speaker 1>while worshiping false idols dangerous.</v>

3668
01:44:49.501 --> 01:44:49.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3669
01:44:49.870 --> 01:44:50.531
<v Speaker 1>it really is.</v>

3670
01:44:50.531 --> 01:44:51.341
<v Speaker 1>It's confusing.</v>

3671
01:44:51.341 --> 01:44:52.174
<v Speaker 1>It's ridiculous.</v>

3672
01:44:52.480 --> 01:44:53.920
<v Speaker 1>And the Real God,</v>

3673
01:44:53.921 --> 01:44:54.550
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

3674
01:44:54.550 --> 01:44:58.210
<v Speaker 1>stop saying the word or say it if you like the universe or the creator and the</v>

3675
01:44:58.211 --> 01:44:59.400
<v Speaker 1>intelligent being whatever it,</v>

3676
01:44:59.440 --> 01:44:59.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3677
01:44:59.710 --> 01:45:01.840
<v Speaker 1>Alex Gray is the visionary artists,</v>

3678
01:45:02.140 --> 01:45:02.501
<v Speaker 1>brilliant,</v>

3679
01:45:02.501 --> 01:45:04.300
<v Speaker 1>brilliant man and a beautiful human being.</v>

3680
01:45:04.350 --> 01:45:06.610
<v Speaker 1>And he came into the podcast and he was just amazing,</v>

3681
01:45:06.880 --> 01:45:08.560
<v Speaker 1>but he uses that word God all the time and he's like,</v>

3682
01:45:08.561 --> 01:45:09.640
<v Speaker 1>we have to take that word back.</v>

3683
01:45:10.190 --> 01:45:10.540
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

3684
01:45:10.540 --> 01:45:11.310
<v Speaker 1>stop connecting.</v>

3685
01:45:11.310 --> 01:45:12.730
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's connecting it to religion.</v>

3686
01:45:12.731 --> 01:45:13.031
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

3687
01:45:13.031 --> 01:45:14.200
<v Speaker 1>what did it represents?</v>

3688
01:45:14.201 --> 01:45:17.260
<v Speaker 1>The idea of the perfection that it is possible,</v>

3689
01:45:17.590 --> 01:45:18.550
<v Speaker 1>represents love,</v>

3690
01:45:18.551 --> 01:45:19.384
<v Speaker 1>it represents,</v>

3691
01:45:19.540 --> 01:45:22.560
<v Speaker 1>and the his really beautiful a point of view on it.</v>

3692
01:45:22.561 --> 01:45:24.640
<v Speaker 1>It really opened me up to that.</v>

3693
01:45:24.641 --> 01:45:28.630
<v Speaker 1>I don't use it that often because people misinterpret it and people</v>

3694
01:45:28.631 --> 01:45:30.110
<v Speaker 1>automatically cookie cutter,</v>

3695
01:45:30.160 --> 01:45:31.240
<v Speaker 1>they shove it into that,</v>

3696
01:45:31.630 --> 01:45:36.630
<v Speaker 1>that framework of predetermined patterns of behavior that have been adopted from</v>

3697
01:45:36.941 --> 01:45:37.774
<v Speaker 1>religions.</v>

3698
01:45:38.080 --> 01:45:42.580
<v Speaker 1>But I think that the heart of everything good at the heart of all good feelings</v>

3699
01:45:42.610 --> 01:45:43.870
<v Speaker 1>is that love thing,</v>

3700
01:45:43.871 --> 01:45:44.140
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

3701
01:45:44.140 --> 01:45:46.020
<v Speaker 1>that the thing that pulls us all together,</v>

3702
01:45:46.021 --> 01:45:46.854
<v Speaker 1>the things just makes it,</v>

3703
01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:47.980
<v Speaker 1>it makes us interact.</v>

3704
01:45:47.981 --> 01:45:48.814
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3705
01:45:49.030 --> 01:45:49.863
<v Speaker 1>that's something,</v>

3706
01:45:50.600 --> 01:45:52.420
<v Speaker 1>if you take the teachings of Jesus,</v>

3707
01:45:52.421 --> 01:45:52.991
<v Speaker 1>of Mohammed,</v>

3708
01:45:52.991 --> 01:45:53.824
<v Speaker 1>of a Buddha,</v>

3709
01:45:53.950 --> 01:45:56.130
<v Speaker 1>of all the great Martin Luther Gandhi</v>

3710
01:45:56.130 --> 01:45:57.510
<v Speaker 3>of all,</v>

3711
01:45:58.020 --> 01:46:02.580
<v Speaker 3>they are all based in the love each other.</v>

3712
01:46:02.610 --> 01:46:05.940
<v Speaker 3>Love your neighbor as yourself.</v>

3713
01:46:06.480 --> 01:46:07.090
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

3714
01:46:07.090 --> 01:46:07.330
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

3715
01:46:07.330 --> 01:46:08.010
<v Speaker 3>and that's,</v>

3716
01:46:08.010 --> 01:46:08.760
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

3717
01:46:08.760 --> 01:46:10.630
<v Speaker 3>that's what I'm saying is it,</v>

3718
01:46:10.631 --> 01:46:12.870
<v Speaker 3>you can't blame anybody.</v>

3719
01:46:12.871 --> 01:46:16.560
<v Speaker 3>And then the it then love the Lord your God or whatever,</v>

3720
01:46:16.561 --> 01:46:16.711
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3721
01:46:16.711 --> 01:46:18.660
<v Speaker 3>with all your might and your heart and it in.</v>

3722
01:46:18.670 --> 01:46:23.670
<v Speaker 3>So it's about infusing love and if you can walk with those really,</v>

3723
01:46:24.271 --> 01:46:24.481
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3724
01:46:24.481 --> 01:46:24.660
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

3725
01:46:24.660 --> 01:46:27.720
<v Speaker 3>and to completely taken away from religion because I certainly,</v>

3726
01:46:28.320 --> 01:46:28.501
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3727
01:46:28.501 --> 01:46:30.540
<v Speaker 3>being the big homosexual I am,</v>

3728
01:46:30.541 --> 01:46:30.691
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

3729
01:46:30.691 --> 01:46:30.871
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3730
01:46:30.871 --> 01:46:31.110
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

3731
01:46:31.110 --> 01:46:32.580
<v Speaker 3>I didn't fit into religion at all,</v>

3732
01:46:32.940 --> 01:46:34.530
<v Speaker 3>so it's yet,</v>

3733
01:46:35.790 --> 01:46:36.301
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>

3734
01:46:36.301 --> 01:46:36.870
<v Speaker 3>let's leave.</v>

3735
01:46:36.870 --> 01:46:37.860
<v Speaker 3>I believe in that.</v>

3736
01:46:37.890 --> 01:46:38.723
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

3737
01:46:39.140 --> 01:46:40.370
<v Speaker 1>I'm with you on taking that back.</v>

3738
01:46:40.400 --> 01:46:44.000
<v Speaker 1>I think that was a huge mistake in keeping homosexuals in the church.</v>

3739
01:46:44.270 --> 01:46:46.490
<v Speaker 1>What a dumb move because by doing that,</v>

3740
01:46:46.491 --> 01:46:48.950
<v Speaker 1>by alienating that aspect of the population,</v>

3741
01:46:49.110 --> 01:46:49.351
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

3742
01:46:49.351 --> 01:46:52.170
<v Speaker 1>you missed out on a whole bunch of other people you can control stupid.</v>

3743
01:46:52.280 --> 01:46:52.580
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3744
01:46:52.580 --> 01:46:53.820
<v Speaker 4>Now they're all against it.</v>

3745
01:46:54.330 --> 01:46:55.580
<v Speaker 4>You dummy dress better.</v>

3746
01:46:55.581 --> 01:46:55.811
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3747
01:46:55.811 --> 01:46:57.180
<v Speaker 4>There was just shitting chess move,</v>

3748
01:46:57.510 --> 01:46:57.770
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3749
01:46:57.770 --> 01:46:59.720
<v Speaker 4>they should have embraced the gay people said that.</v>

3750
01:46:59.721 --> 01:47:01.250
<v Speaker 4>That's just another aspect of life.</v>

3751
01:47:01.251 --> 01:47:02.630
<v Speaker 4>It's just the same,</v>

3752
01:47:02.631 --> 01:47:05.150
<v Speaker 4>just as beautiful as a male woman relationship.</v>

3753
01:47:05.820 --> 01:47:07.790
<v Speaker 4>Right along with you do whatever you want to do.</v>

3754
01:47:07.940 --> 01:47:09.050
<v Speaker 4>And then people have been like,</v>

3755
01:47:09.230 --> 01:47:09.441
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

3756
01:47:09.441 --> 01:47:10.730
<v Speaker 4>there's lesbians in our church today.</v>

3757
01:47:10.731 --> 01:47:11.690
<v Speaker 4>And no one would have cared.</v>

3758
01:47:11.691 --> 01:47:12.411
<v Speaker 4>It would have been fine.</v>

3759
01:47:12.411 --> 01:47:13.640
<v Speaker 4>You had had more people in your church,</v>

3760
01:47:13.641 --> 01:47:14.474
<v Speaker 4>stupid,</v>

3761
01:47:14.800 --> 01:47:15.633
<v Speaker 4>but you blew it.</v>

3762
01:47:15.950 --> 01:47:17.480
<v Speaker 4>Why alienated gay people too.</v>

3763
01:47:17.481 --> 01:47:18.314
<v Speaker 4>That to me is,</v>

3764
01:47:18.500 --> 01:47:19.340
<v Speaker 4>that's a weird one.</v>

3765
01:47:19.341 --> 01:47:20.660
<v Speaker 4>I've never understood that one.</v>

3766
01:47:20.690 --> 01:47:21.470
<v Speaker 4>Fear.</v>

3767
01:47:21.470 --> 01:47:22.250
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3768
01:47:22.250 --> 01:47:22.881
<v Speaker 4>Fear of what?</v>

3769
01:47:22.881 --> 01:47:24.660
<v Speaker 4>If you hear them actually being homosexual,</v>

3770
01:47:25.980 --> 01:47:27.230
<v Speaker 4>your own fear of sex.</v>

3771
01:47:27.231 --> 01:47:28.280
<v Speaker 4>Sex depends on how,</v>

3772
01:47:28.281 --> 01:47:28.971
<v Speaker 4>where you grew up.</v>

3773
01:47:28.971 --> 01:47:30.200
<v Speaker 4>If you grew up in your parents,</v>

3774
01:47:30.520 --> 01:47:33.920
<v Speaker 4>if when you were three years old and running around without a diaper on,</v>

3775
01:47:34.250 --> 01:47:35.700
<v Speaker 4>if you were touching your genitalia,</v>

3776
01:47:36.380 --> 01:47:36.891
<v Speaker 4>I just said,</v>

3777
01:47:36.891 --> 01:47:37.491
<v Speaker 4>genitalia,</v>

3778
01:47:37.491 --> 01:47:38.324
<v Speaker 4>that's fine.</v>

3779
01:47:38.390 --> 01:47:40.910
<v Speaker 4>If you're touching yourself and your mother goes,</v>

3780
01:47:40.911 --> 01:47:41.744
<v Speaker 4>don't do that.</v>

3781
01:47:42.110 --> 01:47:44.600
<v Speaker 4>That starts your whole waiting when there's something wrong with that.</v>

3782
01:47:44.601 --> 01:47:45.560
<v Speaker 4>I'm not supposed to do that,</v>

3783
01:47:46.190 --> 01:47:51.190
<v Speaker 4>and that grows and then depends on all their other parts of your experience and</v>

3784
01:47:51.260 --> 01:47:54.770
<v Speaker 4>any things that naturally happen to us when they put that fear on it,</v>

3785
01:47:54.771 --> 01:47:55.550
<v Speaker 4>then that'll nessie.</v>

3786
01:47:55.550 --> 01:47:56.300
<v Speaker 4>How it's not a,</v>

3787
01:47:56.300 --> 01:47:57.000
<v Speaker 4>not a coincidence</v>

3788
01:47:57.000 --> 01:48:02.000
<v Speaker 1>that the most suppressive aspect of our accepted culture is Catholic priests.</v>

3789
01:48:02.910 --> 01:48:03.271
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3790
01:48:03.271 --> 01:48:04.770
<v Speaker 1>they're not allowed to have sex.</v>

3791
01:48:04.771 --> 01:48:04.930
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>

3792
01:48:04.930 --> 01:48:06.930
<v Speaker 1>and then they're always involved in scandals there.</v>

3793
01:48:06.931 --> 01:48:07.411
<v Speaker 1>Sexual,</v>

3794
01:48:07.411 --> 01:48:07.920
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3795
01:48:07.920 --> 01:48:09.200
<v Speaker 1>we are sexual beings.</v>

3796
01:48:09.280 --> 01:48:10.720
<v Speaker 1>Part of connection with the,</v>

3797
01:48:10.750 --> 01:48:11.610
<v Speaker 1>the God.</v>

3798
01:48:11.820 --> 01:48:12.031
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3799
01:48:12.031 --> 01:48:12.240
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3800
01:48:12.240 --> 01:48:14.010
<v Speaker 1>how do you explain those dumb monks that are up there?</v>

3801
01:48:14.011 --> 01:48:15.390
<v Speaker 1>They're not having sex with anybody either.</v>

3802
01:48:16.340 --> 01:48:17.610
<v Speaker 1>They got a good thing though.</v>

3803
01:48:17.760 --> 01:48:18.061
<v Speaker 1>These,</v>

3804
01:48:18.061 --> 01:48:21.570
<v Speaker 1>they're monitoring their mind to a point where they're controlling their</v>

3805
01:48:21.571 --> 01:48:22.291
<v Speaker 1>physicality,</v>

3806
01:48:22.291 --> 01:48:24.300
<v Speaker 1>but I still think that shit's ridiculous.</v>

3807
01:48:24.450 --> 01:48:24.990
<v Speaker 1>It's true.</v>

3808
01:48:24.990 --> 01:48:25.381
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>

3809
01:48:25.381 --> 01:48:26.460
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to go be a monk.</v>

3810
01:48:26.461 --> 01:48:29.760
<v Speaker 1>I don't worry about this is so not necessarily make it.</v>

3811
01:48:29.970 --> 01:48:32.040
<v Speaker 1>Have you had an experience in the isolation tank?</v>

3812
01:48:32.280 --> 01:48:33.091
<v Speaker 1>I have not.</v>

3813
01:48:33.091 --> 01:48:34.710
<v Speaker 1>I really want to do that though.</v>

3814
01:48:35.070 --> 01:48:37.710
<v Speaker 1>I am consistently amazed at how many amazing,</v>

3815
01:48:37.711 --> 01:48:39.300
<v Speaker 1>interesting people haven't tried that out.</v>

3816
01:48:39.301 --> 01:48:39.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3817
01:48:39.860 --> 01:48:40.200
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

3818
01:48:40.200 --> 01:48:41.033
<v Speaker 1>I haven't.</v>

3819
01:48:41.190 --> 01:48:42.023
<v Speaker 1>Where do you do it?</v>

3820
01:48:42.720 --> 01:48:43.560
<v Speaker 1>I can get you in.</v>

3821
01:48:43.590 --> 01:48:46.200
<v Speaker 1>You want to try it as a place in while there's a,</v>

3822
01:48:46.390 --> 01:48:48.420
<v Speaker 1>the best place in the world actually is in Venice.</v>

3823
01:48:49.260 --> 01:48:49.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3824
01:48:49.620 --> 01:48:50.321
<v Speaker 1>Venice A,</v>

3825
01:48:50.321 --> 01:48:51.270
<v Speaker 1>I dunno if that's close to you,</v>

3826
01:48:51.271 --> 01:48:52.980
<v Speaker 1>but it's a one in Burbank.</v>

3827
01:48:53.710 --> 01:48:55.740
<v Speaker 1>There's a place called soothing solutions in Burbank,</v>

3828
01:48:55.980 --> 01:48:59.730
<v Speaker 1>but the issue of the Burbank place as opposed to the Venice place though is the</v>

3829
01:48:59.731 --> 01:49:00.510
<v Speaker 1>tanks.</v>

3830
01:49:00.510 --> 01:49:01.550
<v Speaker 1>Burbank place is fine.</v>

3831
01:49:01.551 --> 01:49:02.940
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you're close to that,</v>

3832
01:49:02.941 --> 01:49:03.541
<v Speaker 1>definitely go in.</v>

3833
01:49:03.541 --> 01:49:04.980
<v Speaker 1>The lady who runs it is super cool.</v>

3834
01:49:05.310 --> 01:49:09.000
<v Speaker 1>The difference is what that guy at the float lab has done.</v>

3835
01:49:09.240 --> 01:49:10.530
<v Speaker 1>The float lab is the place in Venice.</v>

3836
01:49:10.650 --> 01:49:13.590
<v Speaker 1>He's ticking floating to a completely different place.</v>

3837
01:49:13.620 --> 01:49:15.150
<v Speaker 1>He's a super genius,</v>

3838
01:49:15.151 --> 01:49:19.560
<v Speaker 1>this guys and nuts and he creates these unbelievably solid,</v>

3839
01:49:19.561 --> 01:49:20.161
<v Speaker 1>amazing,</v>

3840
01:49:20.161 --> 01:49:23.590
<v Speaker 1>huge tanks that are so regulated and the,</v>

3841
01:49:23.591 --> 01:49:25.140
<v Speaker 1>they pump oxygen into them.</v>

3842
01:49:25.710 --> 01:49:28.410
<v Speaker 1>He's got it down to such a science that when you're in that,</v>

3843
01:49:28.440 --> 01:49:29.273
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>

3844
01:49:29.370 --> 01:49:32.220
<v Speaker 1>it's just so the environment is so perfect,</v>

3845
01:49:32.221 --> 01:49:33.420
<v Speaker 1>completely soundproof.</v>

3846
01:49:33.600 --> 01:49:34.950
<v Speaker 1>You don't feel anything.</v>

3847
01:49:34.951 --> 01:49:36.570
<v Speaker 1>You're floating through space.</v>

3848
01:49:36.750 --> 01:49:40.680
<v Speaker 1>Your body is just like the water's the same temperature as your skin.</v>

3849
01:49:40.681 --> 01:49:42.510
<v Speaker 1>So as you float there,</v>

3850
01:49:42.570 --> 01:49:45.750
<v Speaker 1>you literally don't feel the water you're released of massive amounts of</v>

3851
01:49:45.751 --> 01:49:46.584
<v Speaker 1>tension.</v>

3852
01:49:46.650 --> 01:49:47.483
<v Speaker 1>Physical.</v>

3853
01:49:47.640 --> 01:49:48.150
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>

3854
01:49:48.150 --> 01:49:50.340
<v Speaker 1>It's amazingly recharging just physically.</v>

3855
01:49:50.341 --> 01:49:52.320
<v Speaker 1>And then if you go in there with brownies,</v>

3856
01:49:52.321 --> 01:49:53.670
<v Speaker 1>you get to meet aliens.</v>

3857
01:49:55.040 --> 01:49:55.730
<v Speaker 3>I believe that.</v>

3858
01:49:55.730 --> 01:49:56.450
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>

3859
01:49:56.450 --> 01:50:00.440
<v Speaker 3>Because all you have to do is just get past that your belief that this is what's</v>

3860
01:50:00.441 --> 01:50:00.891
<v Speaker 3>in front of me.</v>

3861
01:50:00.891 --> 01:50:02.090
<v Speaker 3>So I can't possibly see aliens.</v>

3862
01:50:02.091 --> 01:50:03.500
<v Speaker 3>But if you remove all that,</v>

3863
01:50:04.100 --> 01:50:04.580
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>

3864
01:50:04.580 --> 01:50:05.750
<v Speaker 3>And we say aliens just as,</v>

3865
01:50:05.760 --> 01:50:06.350
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3866
01:50:06.350 --> 01:50:07.610
<v Speaker 3>the spiritual diligence.</v>

3867
01:50:07.620 --> 01:50:07.880
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3868
01:50:07.880 --> 01:50:08.450
<v Speaker 3>Being silly.</v>

3869
01:50:08.450 --> 01:50:08.590
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3870
01:50:08.590 --> 01:50:10.700
<v Speaker 3>It should be something that talks back.</v>

3871
01:50:10.730 --> 01:50:10.851
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3872
01:50:10.851 --> 01:50:11.850
<v Speaker 3>That's what I like to talk to.</v>

3873
01:50:12.260 --> 01:50:14.450
<v Speaker 3>That's when you realize that because some people think,</v>

3874
01:50:14.451 --> 01:50:15.020
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3875
01:50:15.020 --> 01:50:16.880
<v Speaker 3>the way that I believe is very lonely.</v>

3876
01:50:17.060 --> 01:50:17.430
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3877
01:50:17.430 --> 01:50:17.811
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3878
01:50:17.811 --> 01:50:18.081
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3879
01:50:18.081 --> 01:50:19.260
<v Speaker 3>you don't put you up to the holidays.</v>

3880
01:50:19.520 --> 01:50:20.960
<v Speaker 3>We are anything but alone.</v>

3881
01:50:21.020 --> 01:50:21.220
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3882
01:50:21.220 --> 01:50:21.690
<v Speaker 3>It makes me</v>

3883
01:50:21.690 --> 01:50:23.670
<v Speaker 1>very thankful whenever I come out of there.</v>

3884
01:50:24.060 --> 01:50:28.710
<v Speaker 1>That's probably been like the biggest tool for developing my own personality.</v>

3885
01:50:28.711 --> 01:50:32.370
<v Speaker 1>My own view of reality is that because it's a real reset,</v>

3886
01:50:32.371 --> 01:50:35.160
<v Speaker 1>it's a real time off when everything is shut off.</v>

3887
01:50:35.370 --> 01:50:38.040
<v Speaker 1>And when I get out I just want to call my friends and tell them I love them.</v>

3888
01:50:38.240 --> 01:50:40.030
<v Speaker 1>I just want to pet my dog or just want to,</v>

3889
01:50:40.060 --> 01:50:42.450
<v Speaker 1>I really like thankful.</v>

3890
01:50:42.630 --> 01:50:43.610
<v Speaker 1>How long do you stay in it?</v>

3891
01:50:43.630 --> 01:50:44.341
<v Speaker 1>A couple hours.</v>

3892
01:50:44.341 --> 01:50:45.450
<v Speaker 1>I like to do two hours.</v>

3893
01:50:45.870 --> 01:50:46.681

<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3926
01:51:36.181 --> 01:51:37.950
<v Speaker 3>it always starts with inspiration,</v>

3927
01:51:37.951 --> 01:51:39.840
<v Speaker 3>so that can be different.</v>

3928
01:51:39.841 --> 01:51:41.550
<v Speaker 3>That can be me sitting here going,</v>

<v Speaker 3>do you just go run out of the room and write it down?</v>

3936

<v Speaker 3>Actually,</v>

3937
01:51:48.931 --> 01:51:53.010

<v Speaker 3>a melody or something,</v>

3940
01:51:53.881 --> 01:51:55.520
<v Speaker 3>I'll put it on the voice memo.</v>

3941
01:51:56.040 --> 01:51:56.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3942

<v Speaker 3>I do that a lot.</v>

3943
01:51:57.121 --> 01:51:58.560
<v Speaker 3>And then when I have time,</v>

3952
01:52:05.560 --> 01:52:07.180
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you've ever used it on the iPhone.</v>

3953
01:52:07.210 --> 01:52:08.610
<v Speaker 1>It has this little um,</v>

3954

3971
01:52:33.151 --> 01:52:33.570
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>

3972
01:52:33.570 --> 01:52:34.231
<v Speaker 1>cause I used to,</v>

3973
01:52:34.231 --> 01:52:39.231
<v Speaker 1>I have a lot of stuff that I wrote in my little note pad but I'm not as fast</v>

<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3977
01:52:42.850 --> 01:52:43.950
<v Speaker 1>a new idea,</v>

3978
01:52:43.951 --> 01:52:46.100
<v Speaker 1>like a new idea for a joke is so slippery.</v>

3979
01:52:46.460 --> 01:52:48.350
<v Speaker 4>It's like a fish that I can't hold onto,</v>

3980
01:52:48.370 --> 01:52:48.771
<v Speaker 4>can't run.</v>

3981
01:52:48.771 --> 01:52:49.650
<v Speaker 4>And I got to write it down.</v>

3982
01:52:49.651 --> 01:52:49.840
<v Speaker 4>It's good.</v>

3983
01:52:49.840 --> 01:52:50.070
<v Speaker 4>Greg,</v>

3984
01:52:50.070 --> 01:52:50.903
<v Speaker 4>how's that go again?</v>

3985
01:52:51.410 --> 01:52:52.230
<v Speaker 4>Oh I got to,</v>

3986
01:52:52.230 --> 01:52:53.660
<v Speaker 4>someone's still talking to me like please stop,</v>

3987
01:52:53.661 --> 01:52:54.590
<v Speaker 4>stop talking for a second.</v>

3988
01:52:54.920 --> 01:52:55.760
<v Speaker 4>I gotta I gotta hold on.</v>

3989
01:52:56.540 --> 01:52:56.991
<v Speaker 4>What is this?</v>

3990
01:52:56.991 --> 01:52:58.340
<v Speaker 4>How do I write this down and then,</v>

3991
01:52:58.520 --> 01:52:59.500
<v Speaker 4>but if I could just say it,</v>

3992
01:52:59.520 --> 01:53:00.560
<v Speaker 4>it would be way better.</v>

3993
01:53:00.750 --> 01:53:02.420
<v Speaker 4>Like I could get the idea completely.</v>

3994
01:53:02.540 --> 01:53:04.190
<v Speaker 4>Cause sometimes my ideas are so ridiculous.</v>

3995
01:53:04.191 --> 01:53:07.400
<v Speaker 4>Like I have to go back and read them like two or three times to figure out even</v>

3996
01:53:07.401 --> 01:53:08.234
<v Speaker 4>what the Hell I was saying.</v>

01:53:12.080 --> 01:53:15.830
<v Speaker 4>note features where you could do that with just the microphone.</v>

4003
01:53:15.831 --> 01:53:16.401
<v Speaker 4>It's amazing.</v>

4004
01:53:16.401 --> 01:53:17.660
<v Speaker 4>These new cell phones are just,</v>

4005

01:53:18.381 --> 01:53:18.951
<v Speaker 4>you can do with them.</v>

01:53:18.951 --> 01:53:20.030
<v Speaker 4>It's just unbelievable.</v>

4008
01:53:20.060 --> 01:53:20.930
<v Speaker 4>It's so crazy.</v>

4009
01:53:21.830 --> 01:53:25.970
<v Speaker 4>So you write things down just when you have this idea where you record like the</v>

4010
01:53:25.971 --> 01:53:26.331
<v Speaker 4>melody,</v>

4011
01:53:26.331 --> 01:53:28.730
<v Speaker 4>like you hum it or something like that into your voice memos.</v>

4012
01:53:28.910 --> 01:53:29.600
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4013
01:53:29.600 --> 01:53:29.841
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4014
01:53:29.841 --> 01:53:30.390
<v Speaker 4>It depends on,</v>

4015
01:53:30.390 --> 01:53:31.161
<v Speaker 4>or I'll play.</v>

4016
01:53:31.161 --> 01:53:32.810
<v Speaker 4>If it's a piece of guitar playing,</v>

4017
01:53:32.811 --> 01:53:34.400
<v Speaker 4>I'll play that or piano or whatever it is.</v>

4018
01:53:34.401 --> 01:53:39.230
<v Speaker 4>It always comes from different places and then I'll give the time to work it out</v>

4019
01:53:39.231 --> 01:53:40.130
<v Speaker 4>and do what if it's going to be,</v>

4020
01:53:40.370 --> 01:53:43.010
<v Speaker 4>I love when people still keep creating.</v>

4021
01:53:43.011 --> 01:53:43.940
<v Speaker 4>They just never stopped.</v>

4022
01:53:43.941 --> 01:53:45.200
<v Speaker 4>They just keep pumping stuff out.</v>

4023
01:53:45.210 --> 01:53:45.880
<v Speaker 4>I love it.</v>

4024
01:53:45.880 --> 01:53:46.713
<v Speaker 4>I love it.</v>

4025
01:53:46.790 --> 01:53:47.361
<v Speaker 4>It's so,</v>

4026
01:53:47.361 --> 01:53:48.320
<v Speaker 4>it's so fun.</v>

4027
01:53:48.590 --> 01:53:50.000
<v Speaker 4>It's so fun to be a part of,</v>

4028
01:53:50.001 --> 01:53:50.420
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4032
01:53:56.661 --> 01:53:57.290
<v Speaker 4>too.</v>

4033
01:53:57.290 --> 01:54:01.100
<v Speaker 4>It's like we have more access to great information,</v>

4034
01:54:01.101 --> 01:54:02.030
<v Speaker 4>great music,</v>

01:54:04.131 --> 01:54:04.490
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

4039
01:54:04.490 --> 01:54:07.100
<v Speaker 4>we have so much access to inspiration.</v>

4040
01:54:07.101 --> 01:54:08.690
<v Speaker 4>We have so much access to art.</v>

4041
01:54:09.300 --> 01:54:10.460
<v Speaker 4>It's an amazing time.</v>

4042
01:54:10.540 --> 01:54:11.060
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4043
01:54:11.060 --> 01:54:15.980
<v Speaker 4>And to see people embracing the Internet and using the Internet as a method of</v>

4044
01:54:15.981 --> 01:54:17.300
<v Speaker 4>spreading all this stuff too.</v>

4045
01:54:17.630 --> 01:54:18.051
<v Speaker 4>It's just,</v>

4046
01:54:18.051 --> 01:54:18.910
<v Speaker 4>I think it's,</v>

4047
01:54:19.280 --> 01:54:20.900
<v Speaker 4>we just live in just very,</v>

4048
01:54:20.901 --> 01:54:22.100
<v Speaker 4>very rare times.</v>

4049
01:54:22.630 --> 01:54:23.810
<v Speaker 4>That's another thing to be really,</v>

4050
01:54:23.811 --> 01:54:27.290
<v Speaker 4>really happy for and really appreciate it above this time,</v>

4051
01:54:27.700 --> 01:54:28.491
<v Speaker 4>this strange,</v>

4052
01:54:28.491 --> 01:54:33.491
<v Speaker 4>strange time that we exist to do you write and create as just a matter of like</v>

4053
01:54:33.520 --> 01:54:33.670
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

4054
01:54:33.670 --> 01:54:34.760
<v Speaker 4>I mean you're so successful now,</v>

4055
01:54:34.761 --> 01:54:36.050
<v Speaker 4>you just must do it as a desire.</v>

4056
01:54:36.051 --> 01:54:37.220
<v Speaker 4>Like whenever you feel like it,</v>

4057
01:54:37.640 --> 01:54:39.470
<v Speaker 4>not every day like this is my gig.</v>

4058
01:54:39.750 --> 01:54:42.350
<v Speaker 4>Like how do you treat it nowadays?</v>

4059
01:54:42.380 --> 01:54:44.140
<v Speaker 4>My life is so full and so,</v>

4060
01:54:44.470 --> 01:54:48.770
<v Speaker 4>so blessed that when it's time for me to create something,</v>

4061
01:54:49.210 --> 01:54:51.350
<v Speaker 4>it's like I'm thinking about a musical.</v>

4062
01:54:51.380 --> 01:54:52.760
<v Speaker 4>Like I would really love to,</v>

4063
01:54:52.761 --> 01:54:53.030
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4064
01:54:53.030 --> 01:54:53.721
<v Speaker 4>have a musical,</v>

4065
01:54:53.721 --> 01:54:54.830
<v Speaker 4>but that that's a big,</v>

4066
01:54:55.220 --> 01:54:56.300
<v Speaker 4>huge undertaking.</v>

4067
01:54:56.600 --> 01:54:58.850
<v Speaker 4>So I just</v>

4068
01:55:00.440 --> 01:55:01.550
<v Speaker 4>give myself say,</v>

4069
01:55:01.551 --> 01:55:01.821
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

4070
01:55:01.821 --> 01:55:06.140
<v Speaker 4>these few weeks I'm going to get myself from Monday to Friday from 10 to two</v>

4071
01:55:06.380 --> 01:55:06.831
<v Speaker 4>every day.</v>

4072
01:55:06.831 --> 01:55:07.940
<v Speaker 4>That's what I'm going to work.</v>

4073
01:55:08.450 --> 01:55:09.470
<v Speaker 4>And then when I'm done with that,</v>

4074
01:55:09.620 --> 01:55:11.810
<v Speaker 4>then I'll give myself some time off and then I'll say,</v>

4075
01:55:11.811 --> 01:55:12.530
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

4076
01:55:12.530 --> 01:55:14.780
<v Speaker 4>I'll gather the pieces of the notes,</v>

4077
01:55:14.781 --> 01:55:15.201
<v Speaker 4>the stuff,</v>

4078
01:55:15.201 --> 01:55:16.610
<v Speaker 4>and then I'll make another album.</v>

4079
01:55:16.611 --> 01:55:17.300
<v Speaker 4>I'll give myself,</v>

4080
01:55:17.300 --> 01:55:17.661
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4081
01:55:17.661 --> 01:55:17.921
<v Speaker 4>I'll,</v>

4082
01:55:17.921 --> 01:55:18.200
<v Speaker 4>I'll,</v>

4083
01:55:18.200 --> 01:55:19.190
<v Speaker 4>I'll actually work,</v>

4084
01:55:19.640 --> 01:55:21.170
<v Speaker 4>I'll make a time every day to work.</v>

4085
01:55:21.440 --> 01:55:23.470
<v Speaker 4>And when you do that and you put together an album,</v>

4086
01:55:23.480 --> 01:55:23.811
<v Speaker 4>do say,</v>

4087
01:55:23.811 --> 01:55:24.171
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

4088
01:55:24.171 --> 01:55:24.591
<v Speaker 4>you know what,</v>

4089
01:55:24.591 --> 01:55:25.820
<v Speaker 4>let's take this bitch on the road.</v>

4090
01:55:25.821 --> 01:55:26.260
<v Speaker 4>See what's up.</v>

4091
01:55:26.260 --> 01:55:27.093
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

4092
01:55:27.140 --> 01:55:27.501
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

4093
01:55:27.501 --> 01:55:27.890
<v Speaker 4>That's the,</v>

4094
01:55:27.890 --> 01:55:28.701
<v Speaker 4>that's the best part.</v>

4095
01:55:28.701 --> 01:55:33.530
<v Speaker 4>And it's great to create out of nothing and make music is I'm,</v>

4096
01:55:33.770 --> 01:55:34.250
<v Speaker 4>I love it.</v>

4097
01:55:34.250 --> 01:55:36.890
<v Speaker 4>I would do it all the time for nothing.</v>

4098
01:55:37.640 --> 01:55:42.640
<v Speaker 4>And then when I get to take that and share it with a thousand,</v>

4099
01:55:42.681 --> 01:55:44.270
<v Speaker 4>2000 a night and,</v>

4100
01:55:44.640 --> 01:55:45.510
<v Speaker 4>and here,</v>

4101
01:55:45.570 --> 01:55:46.201
<v Speaker 4>here they are.</v>

4102
01:55:46.201 --> 01:55:46.471
<v Speaker 4>And they,</v>

4103
01:55:46.471 --> 01:55:48.280
<v Speaker 4>and they love that music and I'm singing it.</v>

4104
01:55:48.290 --> 01:55:51.570
<v Speaker 4>And in it's an energy exchange that then it's just beyond.</v>

4105
01:55:51.571 --> 01:55:52.290
<v Speaker 4>That's just wonderful.</v>

4106
01:55:52.290 --> 01:55:52.530
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4107
01:55:52.530 --> 01:55:54.040
<v Speaker 4>The live energy exchange.</v>

4108
01:55:54.041 --> 01:55:57.090
<v Speaker 4>Isn't it amazing when the glue your fans and the Chemo there,</v>

4109
01:55:57.091 --> 01:56:02.091
<v Speaker 4>Melissa Etheridge fans and you know you hit him with one of the classics and you</v>

4110
01:56:02.221 --> 01:56:05.720
<v Speaker 4>see their eyes light up and starting the song that people know,</v>

4111
01:56:05.750 --> 01:56:06.101
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

4112
01:56:06.101 --> 01:56:07.620
<v Speaker 4>it must be an amazing feeling.</v>

4113
01:56:08.020 --> 01:56:12.060
<v Speaker 4>It's an amazing feeling to be an audience member in a song you love comes on</v>

4114
01:56:12.061 --> 01:56:12.630
<v Speaker 4>like that,</v>

4115
01:56:12.630 --> 01:56:13.740
<v Speaker 4>but to be able to do it,</v>

4116
01:56:13.741 --> 01:56:14.850
<v Speaker 4>that must be crazy.</v>

4117
01:56:14.851 --> 01:56:16.080
<v Speaker 4>You're a weird conduit.</v>

4118
01:56:16.680 --> 01:56:17.071
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

4119
01:56:17.071 --> 01:56:17.980
<v Speaker 4>I am and it's what it,</v>

4120
01:56:18.150 --> 01:56:19.290
<v Speaker 4>what it really boils down to.</v>

4121
01:56:19.290 --> 01:56:19.801
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>

4122
01:56:19.801 --> 01:56:21.270
<v Speaker 4>You move the energy through you right out.</v>

4123
01:56:21.450 --> 01:56:21.750
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4124
01:56:21.750 --> 01:56:23.340
<v Speaker 4>People that think that's hippy crazy,</v>

4125
01:56:23.341 --> 01:56:24.930
<v Speaker 4>like there's something happening.</v>

4126
01:56:24.931 --> 01:56:26.340
<v Speaker 4>Why am I getting goosebumps?</v>

4127
01:56:26.790 --> 01:56:29.370
<v Speaker 4>There must be something that actually somebody just sent me that the other day</v>

4128
01:56:29.371 --> 01:56:32.790
<v Speaker 4>that some sort of a scientific explanation for why music gives you goosebumps,</v>

4129
01:56:33.300 --> 01:56:34.290
<v Speaker 4>but I say that's horse shit.</v>

4130
01:56:34.680 --> 01:56:35.221
<v Speaker 4>You know what I'm saying?</v>

4131
01:56:35.221 --> 01:56:35.431
<v Speaker 4>Fuck.</v>

4132
01:56:35.431 --> 01:56:36.330
<v Speaker 4>That means why argument?</v>

4133
01:56:36.360 --> 01:56:38.280
<v Speaker 4>It gives me goosebumps and not you.</v>

4134
01:56:38.610 --> 01:56:39.900
<v Speaker 4>Why am I responding to it?</v>

4135
01:56:39.901 --> 01:56:42.630
<v Speaker 4>But to another person that's not the right music.</v>

4136
01:56:42.631 --> 01:56:43.250
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

4137
01:56:43.250 --> 01:56:44.083
<v Speaker 4>You don't believe.</v>

4138
01:56:44.100 --> 01:56:47.850
<v Speaker 4>That's what's really important to recognize that in a lot of people it takes</v>

4139
01:56:47.851 --> 01:56:51.900
<v Speaker 4>them a long time to figure this out is that everybody likes different stuff.</v>

4140
01:56:52.140 --> 01:56:55.620
<v Speaker 4>They just do and they are some people that are not going to be,</v>

4141
01:56:55.860 --> 01:56:57.680
<v Speaker 4>they're not tuned into it for whatever reason.</v>

4142
01:56:57.710 --> 01:56:58.940
<v Speaker 4>They're not I.</v>

4143
01:56:59.700 --> 01:57:04.700
<v Speaker 4>It's a weird thing when you are a performer and you and you are beholden to</v>

4144
01:57:05.341 --> 01:57:07.050
<v Speaker 4>people buying your records in that,</v>

4145
01:57:07.080 --> 01:57:09.570
<v Speaker 4>that chart position or that,</v>

4146
01:57:09.600 --> 01:57:11.400
<v Speaker 4>that certain position,</v>

4147
01:57:11.401 --> 01:57:13.440
<v Speaker 4>that number and you think,</v>

4148
01:57:13.441 --> 01:57:13.831
<v Speaker 4>oh my gosh,</v>

4149
01:57:13.831 --> 01:57:16.170
<v Speaker 4>I want everyone to like me and it's just not possible.</v>

4150
01:57:16.170 --> 01:57:16.980
<v Speaker 4>It's not Bob,</v>

4151
01:57:16.980 --> 01:57:18.900
<v Speaker 4>and that's a good thing everybody,</v>

4152
01:57:18.901 --> 01:57:22.300
<v Speaker 4>and that's why you can then it helps in my belief when I,</v>

4153
01:57:22.410 --> 01:57:22.660
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

4154
01:57:22.660 --> 01:57:23.490
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

4155
01:57:23.490 --> 01:57:28.490
<v Speaker 4>I believe that those who resonate with the music I make will come to it and it</v>

4156
01:57:28.741 --> 01:57:29.730
<v Speaker 4>would just be fine.</v>

4157
01:57:29.731 --> 01:57:30.181
<v Speaker 4>Everybody else,</v>

4158
01:57:30.181 --> 01:57:31.470
<v Speaker 4>I'm not blaming you judging,</v>

4159
01:57:31.471 --> 01:57:32.620
<v Speaker 4>it's just that's what you are.</v>

4160
01:57:32.850 --> 01:57:33.301
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4161
01:57:33.301 --> 01:57:34.980
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's billions of people.</v>

4162
01:57:34.981 --> 01:57:38.940
<v Speaker 4>The people that they'll only love you for who you are.</v>

4163
01:57:38.970 --> 01:57:43.710
<v Speaker 4>If you are who you are and if you tried to be a bunch of different people on a</v>

4164
01:57:43.711 --> 01:57:44.700
<v Speaker 4>bunch of different things,</v>

4165
01:57:44.701 --> 01:57:45.780
<v Speaker 4>we see that over and over.</v>

4166
01:57:46.020 --> 01:57:50.700
<v Speaker 4>We see these people just lose it because they have created a certain persona in</v>

4167
01:57:50.701 --> 01:57:52.500
<v Speaker 4>the public eye and then they feel,</v>

4168
01:57:52.740 --> 01:57:54.390
<v Speaker 4>you start feeling like that persona,</v>

4169
01:57:54.840 --> 01:57:55.360
<v Speaker 4>Eh,</v>

4170
01:57:55.360 --> 01:57:56.131
<v Speaker 4>that's not you.</v>

4171
01:57:56.131 --> 01:57:58.770
<v Speaker 4>So any accolades that that persona gets is not you.</v>

4172
01:57:58.771 --> 01:57:59.760
<v Speaker 4>And then you're just miserable.</v>

4173
01:57:59.760 --> 01:58:02.650
<v Speaker 4>He started drinking and you're fucking crazy puzzles.</v>

4174
01:58:02.651 --> 01:58:05.520
<v Speaker 4>You're driving fast and they're taking your picture.</v>

4175
01:58:05.610 --> 01:58:06.570
<v Speaker 4>How do you avoid it?</v>

4176
01:58:06.571 --> 01:58:08.590
<v Speaker 4>Like crazy rock star cliches like that?</v>

4177
01:58:09.570 --> 01:58:09.751
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

4178
01:58:09.751 --> 01:58:10.640
<v Speaker 4>I figured I uh,</v>

4179
01:58:12.360 --> 01:58:13.440
<v Speaker 4>I have two ex wives,</v>

4180
01:58:13.441 --> 01:58:13.650
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4181
01:58:13.650 --> 01:58:14.610
<v Speaker 4>two baby mamma's side.</v>

4182
01:58:14.850 --> 01:58:18.030
<v Speaker 4>I figure I fall into the rock and roll to Exelon.</v>

4183
01:58:19.800 --> 01:58:20.900
<v Speaker 4>I know what is,</v>

4184
01:58:20.910 --> 01:58:22.170
<v Speaker 4>I like to stay in contact.</v>

4185
01:58:22.530 --> 01:58:27.530
<v Speaker 4>I have to have two children with each of them while I know and I have to send</v>

4186
01:58:27.541 --> 01:58:28.374
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>

4187
01:58:29.400 --> 01:58:30.510
<v Speaker 4>That's hilarious.</v>

4188
01:58:30.710 --> 01:58:33.770
<v Speaker 4>It's the same cliche appears in the male,</v>

4189
01:58:33.870 --> 01:58:34.703
<v Speaker 4>female,</v>

4190
01:58:34.860 --> 01:58:35.040
<v Speaker 4>male,</v>

4191
01:58:35.040 --> 01:58:35.761
<v Speaker 4>female world.</v>

4192
01:58:35.761 --> 01:58:37.470
<v Speaker 4>You got to pay for it no matter what.</v>

4193
01:58:37.471 --> 01:58:38.310
<v Speaker 4>That's what they say.</v>

4194
01:58:40.930 --> 01:58:42.070
<v Speaker 4>Nobody rides for free.</v>

4195
01:58:42.700 --> 01:58:43.120
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

4196
01:58:43.120 --> 01:58:43.540
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

4197
01:58:43.540 --> 01:58:44.500
<v Speaker 4>so you know,</v>

4198
01:58:44.501 --> 01:58:45.041
<v Speaker 4>what would I do?</v>

4199
01:58:45.041 --> 01:58:45.874
<v Speaker 4>We actually,</v>

4200
01:58:45.910 --> 01:58:47.170
<v Speaker 4>because when it comes to the kids,</v>

4201
01:58:47.171 --> 01:58:47.770
<v Speaker 4>we get along.</v>

4202
01:58:47.770 --> 01:58:48.101
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

4203
01:58:48.101 --> 01:58:48.281
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

4204
01:58:48.281 --> 01:58:49.040
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

4205
01:58:49.040 --> 01:58:49.530
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

4206
01:58:49.530 --> 01:58:52.330
<v Speaker 4>I don't have to socialize with them and that's fine.</v>

4207
01:58:52.340 --> 01:58:53.740
<v Speaker 4>But for the kids,</v>

4208
01:58:53.800 --> 01:58:55.270
<v Speaker 4>they need a,</v>

4209
01:58:55.300 --> 01:58:56.133
<v Speaker 4>they need a,</v>

4210
01:58:56.240 --> 01:58:56.710
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4211
01:58:56.710 --> 01:58:57.543
<v Speaker 4>a happy,</v>

4212
01:58:57.720 --> 01:58:58.181
<v Speaker 4>not happy,</v>

4213
01:58:58.181 --> 01:58:58.780
<v Speaker 4>but they need a,</v>

4214
01:58:58.780 --> 01:59:01.630
<v Speaker 4>a cohesive unit that they go back and forth from.</v>

4215
01:59:02.080 --> 01:59:02.701
<v Speaker 4>And so I,</v>

4216
01:59:02.701 --> 01:59:04.240
<v Speaker 4>I'm determined to do that.</v>

4217
01:59:04.750 --> 01:59:05.583
<v Speaker 4>That's awesome.</v>

4218
01:59:05.680 --> 01:59:06.070
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

4219
01:59:06.070 --> 01:59:06.550
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

4220
01:59:06.550 --> 01:59:09.790
<v Speaker 4>the lesbian relationship dynamic,</v>

4221
01:59:09.820 --> 01:59:14.380
<v Speaker 4>is it often like the male female heterosexual dynamic or it depends on who you</v>

4222
01:59:14.381 --> 01:59:14.651
<v Speaker 4>are.</v>

4223
01:59:14.651 --> 01:59:15.490
<v Speaker 4>It depends on what you,</v>

4224
01:59:15.980 --> 01:59:20.590
<v Speaker 4>Paul's with his to Melissa averages both bad asses and that together.</v>

4225
01:59:20.591 --> 01:59:20.981
<v Speaker 4>Is that,</v>

4226
01:59:20.981 --> 01:59:21.660
<v Speaker 4>that'd be nice.</v>

4227
01:59:21.660 --> 01:59:21.991
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4228
01:59:21.991 --> 01:59:22.151
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

4229
01:59:22.151 --> 01:59:22.300
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4230
01:59:22.300 --> 01:59:23.040
<v Speaker 4>I have,</v>

4231
01:59:23.040 --> 01:59:23.500
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

4232
01:59:23.500 --> 01:59:24.221
<v Speaker 4>my partner now,</v>

4233
01:59:24.221 --> 01:59:28.720
<v Speaker 4>her name is Linda and she is a television producer,</v>

4234
01:59:28.721 --> 01:59:29.050
<v Speaker 4>writer,</v>

4235
01:59:29.050 --> 01:59:29.321
<v Speaker 4>director.</v>

4236
01:59:29.321 --> 01:59:30.520
<v Speaker 4>She did nurse Jackie.</v>

4237
01:59:30.700 --> 01:59:31.690
<v Speaker 4>So she's successful.</v>

4238
01:59:31.720 --> 01:59:32.553
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

4239
01:59:32.610 --> 01:59:36.160
<v Speaker 4>I know this bad ass is living together.</v>

4240
01:59:36.220 --> 01:59:37.440
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

4241
01:59:37.910 --> 01:59:39.130
<v Speaker 4>And that it actually,</v>

4242
01:59:40.180 --> 01:59:41.530
<v Speaker 4>because I believe,</v>

4243
01:59:41.560 --> 01:59:44.140
<v Speaker 4>because I finally started believing in myself a few years ago.</v>

4244
01:59:44.141 --> 01:59:44.351
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

4245
01:59:44.351 --> 01:59:45.011
<v Speaker 4>I'm a bad ass.</v>

4246
01:59:45.011 --> 01:59:45.844
<v Speaker 4>I'm a bad ass.</v>

4247
01:59:45.850 --> 01:59:47.290
<v Speaker 4>Then I'm going to draw it.</v>

4248
01:59:47.291 --> 01:59:48.130
<v Speaker 4>But that's what you got to do.</v>

4249
01:59:48.370 --> 01:59:49.360
<v Speaker 4>Then you got to draw,</v>

4250
01:59:49.540 --> 01:59:54.540
<v Speaker 4>then you will draw a bad ass to you because you are vibrating that that's the</v>

4251
01:59:54.821 --> 01:59:55.031
<v Speaker 4>only way.</v>

4252
01:59:55.031 --> 01:59:55.930
<v Speaker 4>If you're sitting there going,</v>

4253
01:59:55.931 --> 01:59:56.920
<v Speaker 4>I need someone to fix me,</v>

4254
01:59:56.921 --> 01:59:58.060
<v Speaker 4>I need someone to come and be,</v>

4255
01:59:58.420 --> 02:00:02.050
<v Speaker 4>then you're going to think yourself as broken and broken.</v>

4256
02:00:02.051 --> 02:00:02.950
<v Speaker 4>People will come to you.</v>

4257
02:00:03.400 --> 02:00:03.761
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4258
02:00:03.761 --> 02:00:06.850
<v Speaker 4>This is something that is driving scientists crazy right now.</v>

4259
02:00:07.030 --> 02:00:08.920
<v Speaker 4>They're hearing this and they're going this demo,</v>

4260
02:00:08.921 --> 02:00:12.070
<v Speaker 4>Melissa Etheridge mirrors nonsense.</v>

4261
02:00:12.460 --> 02:00:13.870
<v Speaker 4>What are you saying?</v>

4262
02:00:14.050 --> 02:00:15.430
<v Speaker 4>Show me the studies.</v>

4263
02:00:15.760 --> 02:00:19.090
<v Speaker 4>Show me peer reviewed papers are shut it.</v>

4264
02:00:19.690 --> 02:00:20.430
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4265
02:00:20.430 --> 02:00:20.650
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

4266
02:00:20.650 --> 02:00:22.240
<v Speaker 4>I think there's a lot of merit to what you're saying.</v>

4267
02:00:22.240 --> 02:00:23.140
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if it's right,</v>

4268
02:00:23.170 --> 02:00:25.030
<v Speaker 4>but I do believe that believing in it,</v>

4269
02:00:25.031 --> 02:00:28.270
<v Speaker 4>it's very powerful and I think that's all I say.</v>

4270
02:00:28.330 --> 02:00:30.640
<v Speaker 4>You're obviously living embodiment of that,</v>

4271
02:00:30.670 --> 02:00:31.031
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4272
02:00:31.031 --> 02:00:34.930
<v Speaker 4>and also a person who's experienced the ups and downs of not being aware of the</v>

4273
02:00:34.931 --> 02:00:37.630
<v Speaker 4>body and then re changing it and becoming aware,</v>

4274
02:00:37.750 --> 02:00:39.430
<v Speaker 4>becoming much happier.</v>

4275
02:00:39.431 --> 02:00:40.264
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

4276
02:00:40.390 --> 02:00:42.070
<v Speaker 4>and I do not do it perfect every day.</v>

4277
02:00:42.100 --> 02:00:42.431
<v Speaker 4>Again,</v>

4278
02:00:42.431 --> 02:00:43.840
<v Speaker 4>this is a practice I make,</v>

4279
02:00:43.841 --> 02:00:44.411
<v Speaker 4>my choices.</v>

4280
02:00:44.411 --> 02:00:44.801
<v Speaker 4>I live,</v>

4281
02:00:44.801 --> 02:00:45.521
<v Speaker 4>I go up and down.</v>

4282
02:00:45.521 --> 02:00:46.354
<v Speaker 4>But that's life.</v>

4283
02:00:46.420 --> 02:00:47.590
<v Speaker 4>Especially when you're busy.</v>

4284
02:00:47.620 --> 02:00:48.370
<v Speaker 4>It's hard.</v>

4285
02:00:48.370 --> 02:00:52.100
<v Speaker 4>It's hard to manage it all and keep cool and treat everybody as if it's you</v>

4286
02:00:52.101 --> 02:00:53.110
<v Speaker 4>living another life.</v>

4287
02:00:53.830 --> 02:00:54.161
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

4288
02:00:54.161 --> 02:00:54.821
<v Speaker 4>it is difficult,</v>

4289
02:00:54.821 --> 02:00:55.654
<v Speaker 4>isn't it?</v>

4290
02:00:55.920 --> 02:00:56.391
<v Speaker 4>Well listen,</v>

4291
02:00:56.391 --> 02:00:56.741
<v Speaker 4>you just,</v>

4292
02:00:56.741 --> 02:00:57.551
<v Speaker 4>you being on here,</v>

4293
02:00:57.551 --> 02:00:58.540
<v Speaker 4>it was a huge treat.</v>

4294
02:00:58.541 --> 02:01:00.440
<v Speaker 4>It was a an honor and it was a,</v>

4295
02:01:00.550 --> 02:01:01.290
<v Speaker 4>it was weird,</v>

4296
02:01:01.290 --> 02:01:01.741
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4297
02:01:01.741 --> 02:01:03.440
<v Speaker 4>because it was like I kept telling me what to do,</v>

4298
02:01:03.441 --> 02:01:04.680
<v Speaker 4>but most of us are just coming on here.</v>

4299
02:01:04.700 --> 02:01:05.533
<v Speaker 4>I tell him</v>

4300
02:01:06.980 --> 02:01:09.220
<v Speaker 4>he does to Brian and I,</v>

4301
02:01:09.221 --> 02:01:12.280
<v Speaker 4>we started doing this in my living room on a laptop as a goof.</v>

4302
02:01:13.840 --> 02:01:15.160
<v Speaker 4>But you believe you loved it.</v>

4303
02:01:15.950 --> 02:01:17.320
<v Speaker 4>What was it you love will grow?</v>

4304
02:01:17.380 --> 02:01:17.621
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

4305
02:01:17.621 --> 02:01:19.630
<v Speaker 4>it became something somewhere along the line.</v>

4306
02:01:19.631 --> 02:01:20.740
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how it happened,</v>

4307
02:01:20.741 --> 02:01:22.990
<v Speaker 4>but it just did and we're just sort of riding it,</v>

4308
02:01:23.050 --> 02:01:23.650
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

4309
02:01:23.650 --> 02:01:26.410
<v Speaker 4>I figured you would ask me the questions that I want to be asked.</v>

4310
02:01:26.411 --> 02:01:28.420
<v Speaker 4>I'm always available to talk like this,</v>

4311
02:01:28.421 --> 02:01:29.810
<v Speaker 4>but no one has stuff.</v>

4312
02:01:29.910 --> 02:01:31.520
<v Speaker 4>And then they will,</v>

4313
02:01:31.600 --> 02:01:33.470
<v Speaker 4>they'll ask me the same 10 questions over there.</v>

4314
02:01:33.790 --> 02:01:34.031
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

4315
02:01:34.031 --> 02:01:37.690
<v Speaker 4>it's very obvious that this way of thinking is important to you,</v>

4316
02:01:37.691 --> 02:01:38.020
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>

4317
02:01:38.020 --> 02:01:38.910
<v Speaker 4>you want to express it.</v>

4318
02:01:38.911 --> 02:01:39.171
<v Speaker 4>And you,</v>

4319
02:01:39.171 --> 02:01:42.270
<v Speaker 4>you're very courageous and expressing it because it sounds fucking crazy.</v>

4320
02:01:42.540 --> 02:01:43.310
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

4321
02:01:43.310 --> 02:01:43.760
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>

4322
02:01:43.760 --> 02:01:45.050
<v Speaker 4>what have I got to lose?</v>

4323
02:01:45.170 --> 02:01:48.080
<v Speaker 4>And I'm not saying it sounds crazy to me all it does sound crazy to me.</v>

4324
02:01:48.080 --> 02:01:49.640
<v Speaker 4>It also sounds possible to me,</v>

4325
02:01:49.970 --> 02:01:50.211
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4326
02:01:50.211 --> 02:01:51.560
<v Speaker 4>I think there's a,</v>

4327
02:01:51.590 --> 02:01:54.740
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of weirdness to the way we perceive the world and there's a lot of</v>

4328
02:01:54.741 --> 02:01:55.390
<v Speaker 4>strange,</v>

4329
02:01:55.390 --> 02:01:58.250
<v Speaker 4>if you can even start from that is maybe that,</v>

4330
02:01:58.251 --> 02:02:01.070
<v Speaker 4>which I think is so definite is not.</v>

4331
02:02:01.100 --> 02:02:02.210
<v Speaker 4>If you can start from that,</v>

4332
02:02:02.211 --> 02:02:03.500
<v Speaker 4>then you're on a journey.</v>

4333
02:02:03.560 --> 02:02:05.270
<v Speaker 4>I think having these conversations are very,</v>

4334
02:02:05.271 --> 02:02:06.050
<v Speaker 4>very important.</v>

4335
02:02:06.050 --> 02:02:09.410
<v Speaker 4>I think having these conversations publicly and just the consideration that</v>

4336
02:02:09.411 --> 02:02:11.900
<v Speaker 4>takes to not necessarily accept the idea,</v>

4337
02:02:11.901 --> 02:02:14.060
<v Speaker 4>but just to consider the points of it and not,</v>

4338
02:02:14.480 --> 02:02:15.260
<v Speaker 4>as I said,</v>

4339
02:02:15.260 --> 02:02:16.910
<v Speaker 4>I believe that that is possible,</v>

4340
02:02:16.911 --> 02:02:18.260
<v Speaker 4>but I also believe in asteroids.</v>

4341
02:02:18.740 --> 02:02:22.070
<v Speaker 4>I believe that if you're in the wrong place at tiger will eat your ass and it</v>

4342
02:02:22.071 --> 02:02:23.240
<v Speaker 4>doesn't mean you're a bad person.</v>

4343
02:02:23.430 --> 02:02:24.263
<v Speaker 4>You live in India,</v>

4344
02:02:24.590 --> 02:02:25.423
<v Speaker 4>London bed.</v>

4345
02:02:25.570 --> 02:02:26.403
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4346
02:02:26.840 --> 02:02:27.400
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>

4347
02:02:27.400 --> 02:02:29.210
<v Speaker 4>So a beautiful way of looking at the world,</v>

4348
02:02:29.330 --> 02:02:30.320
<v Speaker 4>and again,</v>

4349
02:02:30.321 --> 02:02:31.190
<v Speaker 4>you might be right.</v>

4350
02:02:31.460 --> 02:02:32.293
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of,</v>

4351
02:02:32.630 --> 02:02:37.160
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of flexibility to this thing that we exist in and it doesn't seem</v>

4352
02:02:37.161 --> 02:02:42.161
<v Speaker 4>like we are operating on a long history of people's work where they've really</v>

4353
02:02:43.611 --> 02:02:44.270
<v Speaker 4>figured it out.</v>

4354
02:02:44.270 --> 02:02:45.830
<v Speaker 4>It seems like as a culture,</v>

4355
02:02:45.860 --> 02:02:50.510
<v Speaker 4>we've been doing crazy barbaric shift to each other since the jump and we're now</v>

4356
02:02:50.511 --> 02:02:52.310
<v Speaker 4>just in this period of abundance starting to go,</v>

4357
02:02:52.311 --> 02:02:52.461
<v Speaker 4>Whoa,</v>

4358
02:02:52.461 --> 02:02:52.580
<v Speaker 4>Whoa,</v>

4359
02:02:52.580 --> 02:02:52.761
<v Speaker 4>whoa,</v>

4360
02:02:52.761 --> 02:02:52.911
<v Speaker 4>Whoa,</v>

4361
02:02:52.911 --> 02:02:53.150
<v Speaker 4>whoa.</v>

4362
02:02:53.150 --> 02:02:53.481
<v Speaker 4>Hold on,</v>

4363
02:02:53.481 --> 02:02:53.781
<v Speaker 4>hold on,</v>

4364
02:02:53.781 --> 02:02:54.410
<v Speaker 4>hold on.</v>

4365
02:02:54.410 --> 02:02:55.340
<v Speaker 4>Let's Google that.</v>

4366
02:02:55.820 --> 02:02:56.653
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

4367
02:02:58.370 --> 02:02:59.203
<v Speaker 4>is that true?</v>

4368
02:02:59.330 --> 02:03:00.200
<v Speaker 4>Are you sure that's true?</v>

4369
02:03:00.201 --> 02:03:01.460
<v Speaker 4>What are we doing here exactly?</v>

4370
02:03:01.850 --> 02:03:02.570
<v Speaker 4>Where's the,</v>

4371
02:03:02.570 --> 02:03:03.291
<v Speaker 4>where's the oil?</v>

4372
02:03:03.291 --> 02:03:03.590
<v Speaker 4>Whose,</v>

4373
02:03:03.590 --> 02:03:06.050
<v Speaker 4>whose gun is that a real UFO?</v>

4374
02:03:06.320 --> 02:03:07.260
<v Speaker 4>What the fuck is big?</v>

4375
02:03:07.261 --> 02:03:10.870
<v Speaker 4>But that's all happening right now and thank you very much more so it was big,</v>

4376
02:03:10.940 --> 02:03:11.810
<v Speaker 4>beautiful talking to you.</v>

4377
02:03:11.980 --> 02:03:13.550
<v Speaker 4>It was a real pleasure and an honor.</v>

4378
02:03:13.670 --> 02:03:14.420
<v Speaker 4>Thank you very much.</v>

4379
02:03:14.420 --> 02:03:15.320
<v Speaker 4>Thank you so much.</v>

4380
02:03:15.321 --> 02:03:16.580
<v Speaker 4>Your new CD.</v>

4381
02:03:16.581 --> 02:03:18.500
<v Speaker 4>I have it here it is.</v>

4382
02:03:18.501 --> 02:03:19.100
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

4383
02:03:19.100 --> 02:03:19.850
<v Speaker 4>some of this in it.</v>

4384
02:03:19.850 --> 02:03:21.230
<v Speaker 4>I do put that in my music too,</v>

4385
02:03:21.231 --> 02:03:21.710
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

4386
02:03:21.710 --> 02:03:22.071
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4387
02:03:22.071 --> 02:03:23.870
<v Speaker 4>It's a fourth street feeling.</v>

4388
02:03:23.930 --> 02:03:25.190
<v Speaker 4>And is it out everywhere?</v>

4389
02:03:25.191 --> 02:03:27.700
<v Speaker 4>Amazon and iTunes.</v>

4390
02:03:30.610 --> 02:03:33.220
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4391
02:03:33.510 --> 02:03:35.770
<v Speaker 4>It's unlike a lot of CCS.</v>

4392
02:03:35.780 --> 02:03:38.360
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of artwork put into the actual cover,</v>

4393
02:03:38.361 --> 02:03:39.350
<v Speaker 4>which I really miss.</v>

4394
02:03:39.650 --> 02:03:39.891
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

4395
02:03:39.891 --> 02:03:43.520
<v Speaker 4>I'm not old enough to really remember too many records,</v>

4396
02:03:43.521 --> 02:03:44.271
<v Speaker 4>but when I was a little kid,</v>

4397
02:03:44.271 --> 02:03:48.560
<v Speaker 4>I had a Cheech and Chong record and it was big bamboo and I opened it up and it</v>

4398
02:03:48.561 --> 02:03:48.981
<v Speaker 4>was like,</v>

4399
02:03:48.981 --> 02:03:50.840
<v Speaker 4>I didn't even know what smoking pot was back then.</v>

4400
02:03:50.850 --> 02:03:51.171
<v Speaker 4>I was,</v>

4401
02:03:51.171 --> 02:03:51.391
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4402
02:03:51.391 --> 02:03:53.960
<v Speaker 4>I was like eight but I'm are probably knew what it was,</v>

4403
02:03:53.961 --> 02:03:54.920
<v Speaker 4>but I wasn't into it.</v>

4404
02:03:55.520 --> 02:03:56.031
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>

4405
02:03:56.031 --> 02:03:57.410
<v Speaker 4>it's not why I bought it because it was funny.</v>

4406
02:03:57.411 --> 02:03:57.800
<v Speaker 4>But there,</v>

4407
02:03:57.800 --> 02:04:02.330
<v Speaker 4>their album cover was this big like rolling paper thing and you would open it up</v>

4408
02:04:02.331 --> 02:04:02.811
<v Speaker 4>and it was like,</v>

4409
02:04:02.811 --> 02:04:04.370
<v Speaker 4>there was so much work put into it,</v>

4410
02:04:04.620 --> 02:04:05.010
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4411
02:04:05.010 --> 02:04:07.190
<v Speaker 4>really an art form that I do miss.</v>

4412
02:04:07.191 --> 02:04:07.341
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4413
02:04:07.341 --> 02:04:08.560
<v Speaker 4>This the deluxe version,</v>

4414
02:04:08.580 --> 02:04:09.231
<v Speaker 4>my record companies,</v>

4415
02:04:09.231 --> 02:04:09.440
<v Speaker 4>great.</v>

4416
02:04:09.440 --> 02:04:10.640
<v Speaker 4>They'll put out the regular version,</v>

4417
02:04:10.641 --> 02:04:11.474
<v Speaker 4>which has the,</v>

4418
02:04:11.780 --> 02:04:13.220
<v Speaker 4>I think there's 11 songs on there,</v>

4419
02:04:13.310 --> 02:04:17.750
<v Speaker 4>12 minutes and this is the deluxe version that I have a lot of fans that really</v>

4420
02:04:17.751 --> 02:04:20.870
<v Speaker 4>appreciate the extra artwork and the extra songs and so we put that on it.</v>

4421
02:04:21.070 --> 02:04:21.681
<v Speaker 4>That's great.</v>

4422
02:04:21.681 --> 02:04:22.431
<v Speaker 4>Photography.</v>

4423
02:04:22.431 --> 02:04:23.520
<v Speaker 4>Whoever it said that they,</v>

4424
02:04:23.570 --> 02:04:27.230
<v Speaker 4>they really sort of captured the tone of a lot of the music on here.</v>

4425
02:04:27.231 --> 02:04:28.160
<v Speaker 4>It's really awesome.</v>

4426
02:04:28.190 --> 02:04:28.730
<v Speaker 4>What does it,</v>

4427
02:04:28.730 --> 02:04:31.960
<v Speaker 4>what does that car is a replica.</v>

4428
02:04:32.030 --> 02:04:34.250
<v Speaker 4>It is a 64 Chevy impala.</v>

4429
02:04:34.640 --> 02:04:37.470
<v Speaker 4>I asked them to give because that's the first car I had when I was a kid.</v>

4430
02:04:37.500 --> 02:04:41.040
<v Speaker 4>That was the first car I ever bought when I was 15 I got it.</v>

4431
02:04:41.280 --> 02:04:41.850
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

4432
02:04:41.850 --> 02:04:42.171
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4433
02:04:42.171 --> 02:04:43.730
<v Speaker 4>So yeah.</v>

4434
02:04:43.790 --> 02:04:48.390
<v Speaker 4>So I said with a big bench seats in the back and the front was awesome.</v>
