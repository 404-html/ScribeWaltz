1
00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.800
<v Speaker 1>Freak bitches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like my friend Remy,</v>

2
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.580
<v Speaker 1>Remy Warren was in New Zealand and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>used one of those and like wrote in the</v>

3
00:00:08.581 --> 00:00:09.360
<v Speaker 1>log,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.630
<v Speaker 1>where he was from when he was there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I guess it also,</v>

5
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.940
<v Speaker 1>it helps identify if people are missing.</v>

6
00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:16.461
<v Speaker 2>Exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

7
00:00:16.461 --> 00:00:19.580
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a safety precaution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you can kind of track down where</v>

8
00:00:19.581 --> 00:00:21.290
<v Speaker 2>it was the last person seen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

9
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.060
<v Speaker 2>or wherever they last seen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if they were,</v>

10
00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:26.300
<v Speaker 2>if they logged into a shelter and then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

11
00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:27.470
<v Speaker 2>they can't find them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can say okay,</v>

12
00:00:27.471 --> 00:00:31.550
<v Speaker 2>on this date we know that they were here</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you can give a given radius and know</v>

13
00:00:31.551 --> 00:00:34.940
<v Speaker 2>that if they are missing their within at</v>
<v Speaker 2>least within a certain,</v>

14
00:00:34.941 --> 00:00:36.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>20 miles in distance walking distance of</v>

15
00:00:36.951 --> 00:00:37.970
<v Speaker 2>their.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah.</v>

16
00:00:37.971 --> 00:00:41.120
<v Speaker 2>And I think those things actually turned</v>
<v Speaker 2>into like a just fun.</v>

17
00:00:41.121 --> 00:00:43.930
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people just go write full on poems</v>

18
00:00:43.931 --> 00:00:44.764
<v Speaker 2>in there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some,</v>

19
00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>confess like life stories and they're</v>

20
00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:50.250
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh God,</v>

21
00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.000
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The trail log books are entertaining the</v>

22
00:00:53.001 --> 00:00:53.740
<v Speaker 2>doubt.</v>

23

<v Speaker 1>Ghetto savior.</v>

51
00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.850
<v Speaker 1>Baltimore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

52
00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.960
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well you're dealing with like fringe</v>

53
00:02:11.751 --> 00:02:12.650
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

54
00:02:12.651 --> 00:02:17.060
<v Speaker 3>I mean these are people that are just</v>
<v Speaker 3>not fitting into the corporate module.</v>

55
00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.610
<v Speaker 2>I don't what what you're talking about</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the New York Times and I don't</v>

56
00:02:20.611 --> 00:02:22.320
<v Speaker 2>really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to step out and take a</v>

57
00:02:22.321 --> 00:02:23.560
<v Speaker 2>view on it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what,</v>

58
00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:27.630
<v Speaker 2>what I believe you're saying with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>times is that they were pro Clinton and</v>

59
00:02:27.631 --> 00:02:30.780
<v Speaker 2>anti trump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's different from having a position</v>

60
00:02:30.781 --> 00:02:31.614
<v Speaker 2>on climate change.</v>

61
00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.631
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>

62
00:02:32.631 --> 00:02:33.464
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

63
00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.460
<v Speaker 1>because they have a position on just</v>
<v Speaker 1>just take the Lens as climate change.</v>

64
00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:41.960
<v Speaker 1>You have one candidate who is denying</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reality of climate change.</v>

65
00:02:41.961 --> 00:02:42.351
<v Speaker 1>Where?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who's,</v>

66
00:02:42.351 --> 00:02:47.351
<v Speaker 1>who's just claiming that the Chinese</v>
<v Speaker 1>trump?</v>

67
00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.651
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

68
00:02:48.651 --> 00:02:52.130
<v Speaker 1>because it won't because when trump says</v>
<v Speaker 1>climate change is a Chinese hoax,</v>

69
00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.120
<v Speaker 1>you have to call him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here we go.</v>

70
00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.100
<v Speaker 1>He said it's a Chinese hoax.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He should go to China and see those</v>

71
00:03:00.101 --> 00:03:03.220
<v Speaker 1>people that are walking around with gas</v>
<v Speaker 1>masks on because they can't breathe in</v>

72
00:03:03.221 --> 00:03:03.881
<v Speaker 1>Beijing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

73
00:03:03.881 --> 00:03:04.620
<v Speaker 1>But that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's,</v>

74
00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:05.720
<v Speaker 1>that's the pollution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

75
00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:08.900
<v Speaker 1>Which I think is actually much stronger</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's just.</v>

76
00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.220
<v Speaker 1>You can't go to Beijing and say this is</v>
<v Speaker 1>how we want the air to be.</v>

77
00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:16.720
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think something like 20,</v>

78
00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:21.780
<v Speaker 1>I think something like 25 percent of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>air pollution in California on some days</v>

79
00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:24.430
<v Speaker 1>is coming from China.</v>

80
00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.430
<v Speaker 1>Maybe there's some amazing pr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could have that slightly wrong.</v>

81
00:03:27.431 --> 00:03:28.780
<v Speaker 1>Jamie can check that out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but please do.</v>

82
00:03:28.781 --> 00:03:30.490
<v Speaker 1>There's some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some extraordinary amount of</v>

83
00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.160
<v Speaker 1>Arab air pollution that we get from</v>
<v Speaker 1>China.</v>

84
00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:34.780
<v Speaker 1>That's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did not know that.</v>

85
00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:37.160
<v Speaker 1>It makes its way across the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

86
00:03:37.161 --> 00:03:37.994
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it does.</v>

87
00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:43.120
<v Speaker 1>There's no wall build that wall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>

88
00:03:43.121 --> 00:03:44.500
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at a certain point,</v>

89
00:03:44.501 --> 00:03:47.560
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some level of dishonesty and</v>

90
00:03:47.561 --> 00:03:51.610
<v Speaker 1>misinformation that's so egregious that</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're a journalist coming at all</v>

91
00:03:51.611 --> 00:03:56.611
<v Speaker 1>committed to being an unbiased or</v>
<v Speaker 1>disinterested broker of information and</v>

92
00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:59.980
<v Speaker 1>a conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you set up a conversation between,</v>

93
00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:03.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Sean Spicer's of the world or the</v>

94
00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.180
<v Speaker 1>Kellyanne Conway's who were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have their alternative facts and someone</v>

95
00:04:07.181 --> 00:04:10.030
<v Speaker 1>who's honestly talking about whatever it</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

96
00:04:10.031 --> 00:04:11.540
<v Speaker 1>climate change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

97
00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:14.230
<v Speaker 1>it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

98
00:04:14.231 --> 00:04:15.190
<v Speaker 1>you can't split that up</v>

99
00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.020
<v Speaker 2>baby,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think you have to create</v>

100
00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:21.590
<v Speaker 2>mock unnecessary debates around climate</v>
<v Speaker 2>change.</v>

101
00:04:21.591 --> 00:04:23.660
<v Speaker 2>What I do think is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

102
00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.420
<v Speaker 2>with the trump administration,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

103
00:04:26.421 --> 00:04:31.421
<v Speaker 2>that it is imperative for journal that</v>
<v Speaker 2>journalists a call out when things are</v>

104
00:04:32.841 --> 00:04:36.290
<v Speaker 2>said that aren't true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think it's constructive for</v>

105
00:04:36.291 --> 00:04:41.291
<v Speaker 2>mainstream journalistic organizations to</v>
<v Speaker 2>have an openly hostile anti-trump</v>

106
00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:46.930
<v Speaker 2>attitude or pro somebody else attitude</v>
<v Speaker 2>because then you lead that just leads to</v>

107
00:04:47.121 --> 00:04:50.030
<v Speaker 2>further polarization,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when you exactly what we don't need,</v>

108
00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:52.520
<v Speaker 2>but you call them out on all the times</v>
<v Speaker 2>that he said things that were just</v>

109
00:04:52.521 --> 00:04:55.220
<v Speaker 2>absolutely not true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's like your anti trump.</v>

110
00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:56.083
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it can.</v>

111
00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:57.620
<v Speaker 2>There's no question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no question.</v>

112
00:04:57.621 --> 00:04:58.850
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think that's,</v>

113
00:04:58.851 --> 00:05:00.660
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an issue we're dealing with and I,</v>

114
00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:05.700
<v Speaker 2>but I think this is a time of real soul</v>
<v Speaker 2>searching in my industry because I,</v>

115
00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:11.420
<v Speaker 2>I firmly believe there is a very</v>
<v Speaker 2>powerful place in a functioning</v>

116
00:05:11.421 --> 00:05:13.580
<v Speaker 2>democracy for a press,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>

117
00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:17.210
<v Speaker 2>for media that people generally view as</v>
<v Speaker 2>fair.</v>

118
00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:19.510
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how they do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they figured out how to splice</v>

119
00:05:19.511 --> 00:05:24.511
<v Speaker 1>things and change things and selectively</v>
<v Speaker 1>breed certain plants and they came up</v>

120
00:05:25.571 --> 00:05:28.330
<v Speaker 1>with different strains.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why corn looks the way it looks.</v>

121
00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:31.870
<v Speaker 1>Old school corn was like the size of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hobos Dick,</v>

122
00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:35.060
<v Speaker 1>and it was so naughty and fucked up</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

123
00:05:35.061 --> 00:05:37.300
<v Speaker 1>and it was like four inches long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a little tiny thing.</v>

124
00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:39.640
<v Speaker 1>It tastes the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

125
00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:40.481
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hobos.</v>

126
00:05:40.481 --> 00:05:41.230
<v Speaker 1>Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

127
00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:42.610
<v Speaker 1>Hobos dicks are weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

128
00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:47.140
<v Speaker 1>They're so variable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You never know what you get.</v>

129
00:05:47.141 --> 00:05:48.970
<v Speaker 1>And it could be a recent Hobo and be</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

130
00:05:48.971 --> 00:05:51.940
<v Speaker 1>that guy who punched you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just old school snot blowing.</v>

131
00:05:51.941 --> 00:05:54.670
<v Speaker 1>Veteran Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tastes like battery acid.</v>

132
00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:58.880
<v Speaker 1>Those addict.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's through the Pacific southwest</v>

133
00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:01.460
<v Speaker 3>for guys just doing north northwell.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Danny comes in your mouth.</v>

134
00:06:01.461 --> 00:06:04.550
<v Speaker 3>What do you think that to say that like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

135
00:06:04.551 --> 00:06:07.580
<v Speaker 3>guide drinks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Orange juice has come taste better.</v>

136
00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:08.930
<v Speaker 3>Have you heard that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

137
00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:10.160
<v Speaker 3>Whenever I heard that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

138
00:06:10.161 --> 00:06:12.440
<v Speaker 3>how many dicks do you have to suck for</v>
<v Speaker 3>you figure that out.</v>

139
00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:17.730
<v Speaker 3>You can get away from me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you hold this fucking scientists?</v>

140
00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:23.210
<v Speaker 3>He's sucking Dick with a lab coat on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Taking notes,</v>

141
00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:25.700
<v Speaker 3>asparagus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not recommended.</v>

142
00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:30.110
<v Speaker 3>Switching it around in your mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you're a wine connoisseur,</v>

143
00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:34.010
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If a guy eats pineapples,</v>

144
00:06:34.011 --> 00:06:35.990
<v Speaker 3>if a guy eats pineapples,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is cum tastes better.</v>

145
00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:37.970
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But conversely,</v>

146
00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.560
<v Speaker 3>if you're just doing nothing but smoking</v>
<v Speaker 3>meth,</v>

147
00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:42.530
<v Speaker 3>your loads have to taste like hot death.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

148
00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:45.230
<v Speaker 3>And it does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's fucking lumpy.</v>

149
00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:49.220
<v Speaker 3>Pesticide loads.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tastes like roundup.</v>

150
00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:58.040
<v Speaker 3>It's not good when you have to kill it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not much either.</v>

151
00:06:58.041 --> 00:07:03.041
<v Speaker 3>It's like a fucking Hershey's kiss.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No</v>

152
00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:14.270
<v Speaker 3>mother fucker</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't.</v>

153
00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:17.690
<v Speaker 3>She's immediately tripping on meth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's out of her mind.</v>

154
00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:22.950
<v Speaker 4>By the time they came back then they</v>
<v Speaker 4>were different enough from coyotes that</v>

155
00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:26.550
<v Speaker 4>they not only couldn't interbreed with</v>
<v Speaker 4>them anymore,</v>

156
00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:30.870
<v Speaker 4>but they sort of are mortal enemies of</v>
<v Speaker 4>one another.</v>

157
00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:32.970
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when we reintroduced wolves to</v>

158
00:07:32.971 --> 00:07:37.971
<v Speaker 4>yellowstone in 1995,</v>
<v Speaker 4>coyotes had had 75 years and yellowstone</v>

159
00:07:38.641 --> 00:07:40.010
<v Speaker 4>without any wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean.</v>

160
00:07:40.011 --> 00:07:44.760
<v Speaker 4>And that served as a wonderful</v>
<v Speaker 4>laboratory to study them too because it</v>

161
00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:49.890
<v Speaker 4>gave us a sense of what happens with</v>
<v Speaker 4>coyotes when nobody is harassing them</v>

162
00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:52.070
<v Speaker 4>when people aren't harassing him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which of course we didn't.</v>

163
00:07:52.071 --> 00:07:55.980
<v Speaker 4>And Yellowstone Park and when wolves</v>
<v Speaker 4>aren't harassing them either.</v>

164
00:07:55.981 --> 00:08:00.810
<v Speaker 4>And what we realize is that they create</v>
<v Speaker 4>these really stable territory's.</v>

165
00:08:01.290 --> 00:08:05.910
<v Speaker 4>They create very stable packs and their</v>
<v Speaker 4>population rises to a particular point.</v>

166
00:08:05.911 --> 00:08:09.300
<v Speaker 4>The carrying capacity of the landscape</v>
<v Speaker 4>based on what they eat,</v>

167
00:08:09.301 --> 00:08:14.301
<v Speaker 4>which is mostly rodents and rabbits and</v>
<v Speaker 4>things and some fruit and berries,</v>

168
00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:17.610
<v Speaker 4>but it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't,</v>

169
00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:22.710
<v Speaker 4>their populations sort of levels off and</v>
<v Speaker 4>stays at a carrying capacity.</v>

170
00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:28.220
<v Speaker 4>And so we got to watch that happen in</v>
<v Speaker 4>yellowstone for like 75 years and it's</v>

171
00:08:29.161 --> 00:08:34.161
<v Speaker 4>become sort of the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the example of what would happen if we</v>

172
00:08:34.441 --> 00:08:36.750
<v Speaker 4>just left them alone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

173
00:08:36.751 --> 00:08:37.620
<v Speaker 4>some people think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

174
00:08:37.621 --> 00:08:39.830
<v Speaker 4>if we don't try to control them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how they're gonna,</v>

175
00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:42.810
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're just going to be millions upon</v>

176
00:08:42.810 --> 00:08:46.020
<v Speaker 4>millions of them running everywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's actually,</v>

177
00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:50.190
<v Speaker 4>they only do that when you try to</v>
<v Speaker 4>persecute them and they go into this</v>

178
00:08:50.191 --> 00:08:54.450
<v Speaker 4>colonization mode and generate more and</v>
<v Speaker 4>more and more pups and have more and</v>

179
00:08:54.451 --> 00:08:58.440
<v Speaker 4>more pups survive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So yellowstone in that period from 19,</v>

180
00:08:58.441 --> 00:09:03.441
<v Speaker 4>25 to 1995 was this sort of model of</v>
<v Speaker 4>what happens when you just leave them</v>

181
00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:10.280
<v Speaker 4>the hell alone and they just kind of</v>
<v Speaker 4>rise to a particular population level</v>

182
00:09:12.391 --> 00:09:15.740
<v Speaker 4>and are really stable at that level.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

183
00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:17.220
<v Speaker 4>and don't really go beyond it.</v>
