<v Speaker 1>Sometimes I hear you on your podcast and</v>

00:00:27.881 --> 00:00:28.271
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

12
00:00:28.271 --> 00:00:30.130

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:31.000
<v Speaker 1>Sorry about that.</v>

14
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.860
<v Speaker 2>That don't apologize.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's awesome.</v>

15
00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.640
<v Speaker 2>I'm actually more of a half breed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a little bit of south,</v>

16
00:00:36.641 --> 00:00:37.300
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

17
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was a redneck for awhile and then then</v>

18
00:00:40.931 --> 00:00:43.000
<v Speaker 2>became a Yankee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My,</v>

19
00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.500
<v Speaker 2>the people up north don't give a it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't give a shit what people think</v>

20
00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:49.170
<v Speaker 2>north or South.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But this,</v>

21
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.100
<v Speaker 2>the people from the south,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my family,</v>

22
00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:53.290
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're part Yankee now.</v>

23
00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:54.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not Weird.</v>

24
00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:56.260
<v Speaker 2>It's a little weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They lost.</v>

25
00:00:56.261 --> 00:00:59.140
<v Speaker 2>That's why they lost the war thing.</v>

26
00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.080
<v Speaker 1>Can you imagine?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

27
00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.390
<v Speaker 1>we are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're several generations removed.</v>

28
00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:08.500
<v Speaker 1>But imagine growing up in like the late</v>
<v Speaker 1>18 hundreds when it just happened and</v>

29
00:01:08.501 --> 00:01:10.780
<v Speaker 1>you're dealing with Yankees Samos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my mom murders,</v>

30
00:01:10.781 --> 00:01:13.240
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People Killed Northerners and</v>

31
00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.850
<v Speaker 1>northerners killed southerners.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it must have been a lot of that.</v>

32
00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:17.320
<v Speaker 1>It was ruthless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure.</v>

33
00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.360
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how the fuck did that happen?</v>

34
00:01:19.361 --> 00:01:21.940
<v Speaker 1>That is a crazy time you think about</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

35
00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.260
<v Speaker 1>the history of this country that just</v>
<v Speaker 1>200 years ago we were in,</v>

36
00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:27.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>less.</v>

37
00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.640
<v Speaker 1>We're in the middle of a bitter war from</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

38
00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:35.410
<v Speaker 1>the north versus the south Americans</v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting Americans to the death,</v>

39
00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.060
<v Speaker 1>big fields full of dead people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

40
00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.910
<v Speaker 1>my dad was at one of the fields,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forget which field it was.</v>

41
00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:46.090
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

42
00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.871
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

43
00:01:46.871 --> 00:01:49.780
<v Speaker 1>it's one of those memorial places in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>south.</v>

44
00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.880
<v Speaker 1>And he said the feelings Berg or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

45
00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Want it was Gettysburg and he sent you</v>

46
00:01:54.971 --> 00:01:56.050
<v Speaker 1>feel it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

47
00:01:56.051 --> 00:01:57.550
<v Speaker 1>you feel sadness then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

48
00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.200
<v Speaker 1>So I get sound.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know it sounds crazy.</v>

49
00:01:59.201 --> 00:02:01.900
<v Speaker 1>And he was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even believe in that stuff,</v>

50
00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:03.850
<v Speaker 1>but you feel it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you're there and you're like,</v>

51
00:02:03.851 --> 00:02:04.010
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

52
00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:07.250
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've been in a few memorials.</v>

53
00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:11.450
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a few memorials and a few big,</v>

54
00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:12.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

55
00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.610
<v Speaker 2>especially like military cemeteries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

56
00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:16.850
<v Speaker 2>you just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

57
00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.700
<v Speaker 2>you know another one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt it like exactly what you're</v>

58
00:02:19.701 --> 00:02:20.900
<v Speaker 2>saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

59
00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.520
<v Speaker 2>I went to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

60
00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.370
<v Speaker 2>a historic part of custer where they</v>
<v Speaker 2>lost the battle and I walked the whole</v>

61
00:02:28.371 --> 00:02:31.310
<v Speaker 2>hill and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can feel it there.</v>

62
00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:32.390
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is that?</v>

63
00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.160
<v Speaker 2>Do you think there's like memory in</v>
<v Speaker 2>places?</v>

64
00:02:34.161 --> 00:02:35.270
<v Speaker 2>Hell yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is.</v>

65
00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:37.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It probably is.</v>

66
00:02:37.331 --> 00:02:39.730
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there is probably an instinctive</v>

67
00:02:39.731 --> 00:02:42.250
<v Speaker 1>reason why people don't want to live in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a house where someone was murdered.</v>

68
00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:44.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to live there.</v>

69
00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.740
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to live there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could you like,</v>

70
00:02:47.741 --> 00:02:50.020
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a house that Jon Benet Ramsey</v>

71
00:02:50.021 --> 00:02:51.370
<v Speaker 1>was killed in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Colorado.</v>

72
00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.920
<v Speaker 1>They can't sell that fucking house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>

73
00:02:53.921 --> 00:02:54.754

<v Speaker 3>Mm.</v>

75
00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.930
<v Speaker 1>Nine years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eight years ago,</v>

76
00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:00.100
<v Speaker 1>somewhere on with them nine years</v>

77
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.040
<v Speaker 4>ago and they were selling it then they</v>
<v Speaker 4>still can't sell it.</v>

78
00:03:03.041 --> 00:03:05.830
<v Speaker 4>It's a beautiful house.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's in a really nice neighborhood.</v>

79
00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:08.170
<v Speaker 4>Can't sell it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have changed the name of the</v>

80
00:03:08.171 --> 00:03:09.490
<v Speaker 4>street.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They changed the name of the street.</v>

81
00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:11.770
<v Speaker 4>Still can't sell it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not kidding.</v>

82
00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:14.230
<v Speaker 4>They just can't sell it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It has it.</v>

83
00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.580
<v Speaker 4>Does it have like historical everybody's</v>
<v Speaker 4>terrible sightings and stuff or was it</v>

84
00:03:18.581 --> 00:03:21.300
<v Speaker 4>just the killing?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just the killing and the hold.</v>

85
00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.710
<v Speaker 4>The darkness all behind it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that was one.</v>

86
00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:25.750
<v Speaker 4>It was just was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't just a little girl died,</v>

87
00:03:25.751 --> 00:03:29.620
<v Speaker 4>but there's all this darkness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She was sexually active.</v>

88
00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.440
<v Speaker 4>There was something going like someone</v>
<v Speaker 4>was probably molesting her,</v>

89
00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.840
<v Speaker 4>someone in the family or someone else</v>
<v Speaker 4>who knows.</v>

90
00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:36.670
<v Speaker 4>They think someone in the family might</v>
<v Speaker 4>have killed her.</v>

91
00:03:36.671 --> 00:03:39.340
<v Speaker 4>They don't know who it was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's never been solved.</v>

92
00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:40.450
<v Speaker 4>No one's ever been tried.</v>

93
00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:42.610
<v Speaker 4>It's a dark.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

94
00:03:42.611 --> 00:03:44.230
<v Speaker 4>I'm not moving there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fuck that.</v>

95
00:03:44.231 --> 00:03:46.000
<v Speaker 4>They can keep that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>keep that house.</v>

96
00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:50.230
<v Speaker 4>I think they should level that thing to</v>
<v Speaker 4>the ground and maybe even do something</v>

97
00:03:50.231 --> 00:03:52.240
<v Speaker 4>with the ground underneath it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Scoop all that shit out.</v>

98
00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.020
<v Speaker 4>Put some new dirt and I'm not kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not kidding.</v>

99
00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.820
<v Speaker 4>Like that might be the only way you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>going to throw that Mojo on though.</v>

100
00:04:00.821 --> 00:04:03.370
<v Speaker 4>You've got to put that term.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You got to put that dirt somewhere.</v>

101
00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:06.310
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's worthy of taking it.</v>

102
00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:07.420
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Where would you put that dirt?</v>

103
00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:10.600
<v Speaker 4>You have to exercise it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You'd have to build like the most</v>

104
00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:15.280
<v Speaker 4>awesome park for kids.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you'd have to turn that house into</v>

105
00:04:15.281 --> 00:04:18.190
<v Speaker 4>something positive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to do anything for kids.</v>

106
00:04:18.191 --> 00:04:20.290
<v Speaker 4>They're for sure that would be bad</v>
<v Speaker 4>taste,</v>

107
00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.550
<v Speaker 4>but you could always take that big scoop</v>
<v Speaker 4>and kind of put it in a freak party</v>

108
00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:28.690
<v Speaker 4>desert or something where people that</v>
<v Speaker 4>like ghosts and crap can go out there</v>

109
00:04:28.691 --> 00:04:33.430
<v Speaker 4>and play in it or camp on it or what he</v>
<v Speaker 4>likes little kid ghosts you want like</v>

110
00:04:33.431 --> 00:04:35.740
<v Speaker 4>some old man goes can tell you secrets.</v>

111
00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.010
<v Speaker 4>Have you ever seen it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You think you've ever seen?</v>

112
00:04:39.011 --> 00:04:39.641
<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

113
00:04:39.641 --> 00:04:41.860
<v Speaker 4>I do not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have you ever experienced something that</v>

114
00:04:41.861 --> 00:04:44.530
<v Speaker 4>was like super creepy that you know</v>
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>

115
00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:49.000
<v Speaker 4>A couple of my friends at the comedy</v>
<v Speaker 4>store have claimed to have seen ghosts</v>

116
00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:54.120
<v Speaker 4>and claim to have seen things and I with</v>
<v Speaker 4>many of my friends that work there and</v>

117
00:04:54.191 --> 00:04:56.470
<v Speaker 4>comics and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we've gone upstairs to the belly room in</v>

118
00:04:56.471 --> 00:04:58.490
<v Speaker 4>the dark,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just freaked ourselves out and went and</v>

119
00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:00.940
<v Speaker 4>ran out of there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Stoned out of her mind.</v>

<v Speaker 4>John Dudley is riding the Werewolf.</v>

137
00:05:34.511 --> 00:05:35.241
<v Speaker 4>We were trying to figure out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

138
00:05:35.241 --> 00:05:36.550
<v Speaker 4>the wearables,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Patrick Biggie has a new movie out.</v>

<v Speaker 4>That's such an awesome picture.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>

147
00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:59.930
<v Speaker 4>Pat Mcgee,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the guy who made that,</v>

148
00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:01.250
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just made a movie,</v>

149
00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:04.850
<v Speaker 4>a big foot movie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's called a primal scream,</v>

150
00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:06.530
<v Speaker 4>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Isn't that what it's called?</v>

151
00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:07.880
<v Speaker 4>It just came out.</v>

152
00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:10.520
<v Speaker 4>Is it a legit one or like a horror</v>
<v Speaker 4>movie?</v>

153
00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:13.430
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Put your monster.</v>

154
00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:14.810
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Kellen people.</v>

155
00:06:14.811 --> 00:06:16.730
<v Speaker 4>I watched that Jack and people in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>woods.</v>

156
00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:17.750
<v Speaker 4>I watch that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

157
00:06:17.751 --> 00:06:19.400
<v Speaker 4>It got good reviews.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I hope it's good.</v>

158
00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:22.340
<v Speaker 4>I love me a good big foot movie and</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's not a whole lot of them.</v>

159
00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:25.850
<v Speaker 4>I think we would've saw bigfoot a long</v>
<v Speaker 4>time ago.</v>

160
00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:26.883
<v Speaker 4>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

161
00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:28.190
<v Speaker 4>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>

162
00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:29.930
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but um,</v>

163
00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:33.380
<v Speaker 4>what would you do if you actually ran</v>
<v Speaker 4>across one double lung,</v>

164
00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:38.270
<v Speaker 4>which you take the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>take the penalty double on proven point.</v>

165
00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:42.530
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would hope I'd have my camera on me,</v>

166
00:06:42.531 --> 00:06:44.330
<v Speaker 4>but then people would call me a fucking</v>
<v Speaker 4>liar.</v>

167
00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:46.850
<v Speaker 4>That would be a bummer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you really saw big foot,</v>

168
00:06:46.851 --> 00:06:47.671
<v Speaker 4>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>God damn it.</v>

169
00:06:47.671 --> 00:06:50.330
<v Speaker 4>He's real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Never one's gonna think I'm crazy</v>

170
00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:52.880
<v Speaker 4>because everybody that I know that</v>
<v Speaker 4>believes in big foot,</v>

171
00:06:52.881 --> 00:06:53.300
<v Speaker 4>I'm always looking.</v>

172
00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:55.730
<v Speaker 4>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everybody thinks they chart.</v>

173
00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:58.200
<v Speaker 4>Even if you've got a picture,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no one,</v>

174
00:06:58.280 --> 00:06:59.220
<v Speaker 4>no one's going to believe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

175
00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:03.020
<v Speaker 4>Then you're going to meet all the good</v>
<v Speaker 4>faith that you've built up by being</v>

176
00:07:03.021 --> 00:07:06.020
<v Speaker 4>honest all these years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people fuck that guy.</v>

177
00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:09.440
<v Speaker 4>He's full of Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He faked a bigfoot sighting man.</v>

178
00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:12.050
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't,</v>

179
00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:13.730
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't shoot it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Definitely not.</v>

180
00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:16.850
<v Speaker 4>But I think if it was real,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really do believe that if it was real,</v>

181
00:07:16.851 --> 00:07:17.870
<v Speaker 4>this is the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is the,</v>

182
00:07:17.871 --> 00:07:22.160
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the trailer for Omar C and Pat Mcgee did</v>

183
00:07:22.161 --> 00:07:27.161
<v Speaker 4>this with a all special effects like</v>
<v Speaker 4>suits and shit and actual makeup and</v>

184
00:07:28.161 --> 00:07:31.910
<v Speaker 4>prosthetics and all the stuff that they</v>
<v Speaker 4>used in the old movies.</v>

185
00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:34.010
<v Speaker 4>Like he doesn't believe in that CGI</v>
<v Speaker 4>shit.</v>

186
00:07:34.011 --> 00:07:36.260
<v Speaker 4>And I think he's got a point at CGI</v>
<v Speaker 4>shit.</v>

187
00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:37.910
<v Speaker 4>It's just too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it takes away.</v>

188
00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:39.290
<v Speaker 4>It does.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

189
00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:42.380
<v Speaker 4>you look back at some of the movies that</v>
<v Speaker 4>scared,</v>

190
00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:45.050
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>scared the hell out of you when you're a</v>

191
00:07:45.051 --> 00:07:46.730
<v Speaker 4>kid and you watch them down and you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

192
00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:48.560
<v Speaker 4>what the man did?</v>

193
00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:50.690
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it just seems so much more real.</v>

194
00:07:50.691 --> 00:07:52.940
<v Speaker 4>But if you watch something to where you</v>
<v Speaker 4>know it's fake,</v>

195
00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:56.900
<v Speaker 4>it's almost,</v>
<v Speaker 4>can't picture the fact that it's flesh</v>

196
00:07:56.901 --> 00:07:57.770
<v Speaker 4>and blood.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

197
00:07:57.780 --> 00:07:59.330
<v Speaker 4>And you need,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't feel it.</v>

198
00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:02.090
<v Speaker 4>Like there's some of those transformer</v>
<v Speaker 4>type movies.</v>

199
00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:04.850
<v Speaker 4>They're smashing buildings and like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know this isn't happening.</v>

200
00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:08.540
<v Speaker 4>Just you don't feel it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't feel like a real explosion.</v>

201
00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:11.510
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't feel like a real robot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just feels like horseshit.</v>

202
00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:13.850
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the Dyno bots pretty.</v>

203
00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:15.680
<v Speaker 4>They're pretty dope.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's the Dyno Bot?</v>

204
00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:19.500
<v Speaker 4>It's a dinosaur version.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that one of the transformers and your</v>

205
00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:20.330
<v Speaker 4>years?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

206
00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:24.980
<v Speaker 4>schooled</v>
<v Speaker 4>robots and transformers were the bomb</v>

207
00:08:24.981 --> 00:08:28.700
<v Speaker 4>man when I was a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That and a cabbage patch kids.</v>

208
00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:34.480
<v Speaker 4>So it wasn't a crazy that that became,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that transformers became huge hit</v>

209
00:08:35.451 --> 00:08:37.640
<v Speaker 4>movies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was a dumb toy,</v>

210
00:08:37.970 --> 00:08:38.870
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>

211
00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:40.580
<v Speaker 4>Was it originally a toy?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

212
00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:43.560
<v Speaker 4>Transformers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were cool and shouldn't say dumb</v>

213
00:08:43.561 --> 00:08:44.630
<v Speaker 4>toy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If anyone's a collector,</v>

214
00:08:44.631 --> 00:08:45.464
<v Speaker 4>they're freaking out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

215
00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:46.970
<v Speaker 4>Dumb to me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How about that?</v>

216
00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.740
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>go bots and transformers.</v>

217
00:08:48.741 --> 00:08:49.700
<v Speaker 4>They were,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

218
00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:51.620
<v Speaker 4>before that you had,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

220
00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:56.260

221
00:08:56.270 --> 00:08:58.200
<v Speaker 5>man?</v>
<v Speaker 5>They were all freaking jacked.</v>

222
00:08:58.201 --> 00:09:00.210
<v Speaker 5>You know what I remember?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I remember stretch Armstrong.</v>

223
00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:01.830
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>home part.</v>

224
00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:03.360
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

225
00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:05.640
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They never made a movie out of him,</v>

226
00:09:05.641 --> 00:09:07.170
<v Speaker 5>did they?</v>
<v Speaker 5>My boy.</v>

227
00:09:07.650 --> 00:09:10.670
<v Speaker 5>What's funny is they didn't have,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they did have some of that stuff there.</v>

228
00:09:10.671 --> 00:09:14.220
<v Speaker 5>They are a little muscle.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then there's something that looks really</v>

229
00:09:14.221 --> 00:09:18.870
<v Speaker 5>good about that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're all pink girl pink and those</v>

230
00:09:18.871 --> 00:09:20.730
<v Speaker 5>were pretty cool.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just on a,</v>

231
00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:23.130
<v Speaker 5>just a roundabout gas.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How many dudes have stuffed those up</v>

232
00:09:23.131 --> 00:09:26.310
<v Speaker 5>their house?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hundreds or thousands.</v>

233
00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:27.990
<v Speaker 5>I'd say thousands.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Thousands,</v>

234
00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:29.110
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Thousands of people.</v>

235
00:09:29.111 --> 00:09:31.350
<v Speaker 5>I've had those in there as we're going</v>
<v Speaker 5>down that road already.</v>

236
00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:32.610
<v Speaker 5>Why not?</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you just,</v>

237
00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:40.060
<v Speaker 5>if we could pull out like a pullback,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you think of a teenage mutant Ninja</v>

238
00:09:40.650 --> 00:09:41.071
<v Speaker 5>Turtles,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

239
00:09:41.071 --> 00:09:44.100
<v Speaker 5>Did not start off as a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>was that a comic book?</v>

240
00:09:44.190 --> 00:09:45.490
<v Speaker 5>It was a comic.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was a comic book.</v>

241
00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:46.890
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It wasn't a toy first.</v>

242
00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:51.030
<v Speaker 5>That's my boy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He really got into,</v>

243
00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:56.090
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what it was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he had this Peter Pan doll and I</v>

244
00:09:56.731 --> 00:09:59.370
<v Speaker 5>think because he didn't have a brother</v>
<v Speaker 5>or sister,</v>

245
00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:05.270
<v Speaker 5>he would beat the shit out of this Peter</v>
<v Speaker 5>Pan doll and he wouldn't do it when</v>

246
00:10:07.021 --> 00:10:07.980
<v Speaker 5>everyone was there.</v>

247
00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:09.590
<v Speaker 5>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you as adults,</v>

248
00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:10.341
<v Speaker 5>she of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

249
00:10:10.341 --> 00:10:13.770
<v Speaker 5>you ended up coming around the corner to</v>
<v Speaker 5>see if they're okay or whatever.</v>

250
00:10:13.771 --> 00:10:15.450
<v Speaker 5>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We went downstairs for a while and I</v>

251
00:10:15.451 --> 00:10:19.440
<v Speaker 5>come up there and I mean he's just got</v>
<v Speaker 5>his back to the door.</v>

252
00:10:19.441 --> 00:10:24.060
<v Speaker 5>Just fricking power drop in Peter Pan</v>
<v Speaker 5>just kicking this thing in the face</v>

253
00:10:24.061 --> 00:10:28.130
<v Speaker 5>punched in it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean Sharon and I just laugh about it</v>

254
00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:32.310
<v Speaker 5>or like he doesn't do it with anyone</v>
<v Speaker 5>else who for whatever reason Peter Pan</v>

255
00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:36.380
<v Speaker 5>is just his little brother and he just</v>
<v Speaker 5>kicks the shit out of that sucker.</v>

256
00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:39.930
<v Speaker 5>Peter Pan's his bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What about Robin Hood?</v>

257
00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:45.960
<v Speaker 5>There was a robin hood toys ever did</v>
<v Speaker 5>ever kids ever get a robin hood toy that</v>

258
00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:48.210
<v Speaker 5>we need a disney movie,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so I'm sure it got around now.</v>

259
00:10:48.211 --> 00:10:49.920
<v Speaker 5>But that was because of the story,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

260
00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:52.370
<v Speaker 5>Robin had the Disney movie.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was all because of the original rob.</v>

261
00:10:52.371 --> 00:10:54.960
<v Speaker 5>You story physical like action figures.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Were they popular?</v>

262
00:10:54.961 --> 00:10:55.794
<v Speaker 5>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

263
00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:58.020
<v Speaker 5>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

264
00:10:58.021 --> 00:10:59.670
<v Speaker 5>Maybe when that Kevin Costner movie came</v>
<v Speaker 5>out,</v>

265
00:10:59.671 --> 00:11:01.810
<v Speaker 5>they sold a few,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I bet they didn't.</v>

266
00:11:03.130 --> 00:11:05.100
<v Speaker 5>I'd say a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe a few.</v>

267
00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:08.820
<v Speaker 5>I forgot that was a movie.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How bad was Kevin Costner's forum and</v>

268
00:11:08.821 --> 00:11:09.860
<v Speaker 5>that movie was it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

288
00:11:54.740 --> 00:11:56.650
<v Speaker 4>It looks like he's pouring a full metal</v>
<v Speaker 4>one.</v>

289
00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:57.610
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's dope.</v>

290
00:11:57.700 --> 00:11:59.720
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They would melt it down and pour it in a</v>

291
00:11:59.730 --> 00:12:03.520
<v Speaker 4>cast thing out like a rocky mountain cut</v>
<v Speaker 4>throat or something.</v>

292
00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:06.040
<v Speaker 4>I'll look at his,</v>
<v Speaker 4>showing them,</v>

<v Speaker 4>drive home in it.</v>

296
00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:15.550
<v Speaker 4>How did they possibly know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did they use scales to figure out how</v>

297
00:12:15.551 --> 00:12:17.450
<v Speaker 4>much the arrows weighed back then it was</v>
<v Speaker 4>even a scallop.</v>

298
00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:19.870
<v Speaker 4>No fucking guy on the right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's killing me.</v>

299
00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:22.930
<v Speaker 4>That's about how everyone would shoot</v>
<v Speaker 4>with that equipment.</v>

300
00:12:22.931 --> 00:12:25.530
<v Speaker 4>Nowadays.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Morgan Freeman was asthma blood.</v>

<v Speaker 4>This is hilarious.</v>

<v Speaker 4>This is so dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a Kevin Costner Fan.</v>

303
00:12:34.841 --> 00:12:35.950
<v Speaker 4>Don't get me wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not a hater,</v>

304
00:12:35.951 --> 00:12:38.020
<v Speaker 4>but damn Kevin costs has been in some</v>
<v Speaker 4>stinkers.</v>

305
00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:39.130
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>now they're getting better.</v>

306

<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 4>people don't understand.</v>

312
00:12:50.531 --> 00:12:52.390
<v Speaker 4>Splitting an Arrow is fucking stupid.</v>

313
00:12:55.010 --> 00:12:57.680
<v Speaker 4>It's costly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not wise.</v>

314
00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:00.590
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at least there was no cgi in this for</v>

<v Speaker 4>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:07.100
<v Speaker 4>Is he trying to curve it around it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what he's doing.</v>

318
00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:09.260
<v Speaker 4>Why is he looking at,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's going to cut the string.</v>

319
00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:13.170
<v Speaker 4>Let me this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They got all the dramas killing me.</v>

320
00:13:13.270 --> 00:13:15.500
<v Speaker 4>Sincerely is saying I wasn't sure if it</v>
<v Speaker 4>was going to hit.</v>

321
00:13:15.890 --> 00:13:18.380
<v Speaker 4>The drama is killing me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a slow ass heroine,</v>

322
00:13:18.410 --> 00:13:19.170
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

323
00:13:19.170 --> 00:13:20.600
<v Speaker 4>How much,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean seconds.</v>

324
00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:25.580
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if you shot that and access</v>
<v Speaker 4>dear thanks.</v>

325
00:13:25.581 --> 00:13:27.620
<v Speaker 4>Just Steve would be like be on the other</v>
<v Speaker 4>island.</v>

326
00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:29.480
<v Speaker 4>I've never seen anything like those</v>
<v Speaker 4>things.</v>

327
00:13:30.270 --> 00:13:33.920
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>John and I hunted axis deer in Hawaii</v>

328
00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:38.480
<v Speaker 4>where they were brought over.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was reading as a like a gift to the</v>

329
00:13:38.481 --> 00:13:41.660
<v Speaker 4>king in the 18 hundreds hosted that</v>
<v Speaker 4>today actually.</v>

330
00:13:42.140 --> 00:13:43.490
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's probably where I was reading it.</v>

331
00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:48.070
<v Speaker 4>I'm pretty sure I knew it already,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think of it,</v>

332
00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:50.330
<v Speaker 4>that's exactly where I was reading it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But they,</v>

333
00:13:50.390 --> 00:13:52.970
<v Speaker 4>I've never seen anything move as fast as</v>
<v Speaker 4>those things.</v>

334
00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:56.900
<v Speaker 4>Like you could shoot at one that's 40</v>
<v Speaker 4>yards away and by the time the Arrow</v>

335
00:13:56.901 --> 00:13:58.010
<v Speaker 4>gets there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's nowhere near it.</v>

336
00:13:58.070 --> 00:13:59.630
<v Speaker 4>It's like Chung.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

337
00:13:59.631 --> 00:14:04.100
<v Speaker 4>You need to load those fast twitch</v>
<v Speaker 4>muscles in a UFC fighter of today.</v>

338
00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:07.880
<v Speaker 4>Just be concussion city.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It'd be crazy.</v>

339
00:14:07.881 --> 00:14:10.550
<v Speaker 4>I've never just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've never seen an animal react to</v>

340
00:14:10.551 --> 00:14:12.860
<v Speaker 4>something so quick,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it makes sense that they evolved</v>

341
00:14:12.861 --> 00:14:15.110
<v Speaker 4>around Tigers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>tigers and leopards.</v>

342
00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:18.200
<v Speaker 4>Fucking shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Roll the dice.</v>

343
00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:21.140
<v Speaker 4>Imagine being tiger and Leopard</v>
<v Speaker 4>preferred food.</v>

344
00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:23.000
<v Speaker 4>And that's the other thing about axis</v>
<v Speaker 4>deer.</v>

345
00:14:23.210 --> 00:14:25.600
<v Speaker 4>They are delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>

346
00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:27.500
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like one of the most delicious animals</v>

347
00:14:27.501 --> 00:14:30.410
<v Speaker 4>on the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And obviously tigers must know this.</v>

348
00:14:30.650 --> 00:14:32.590
<v Speaker 4>Oh I bet they have to know it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

349
00:14:32.630 --> 00:14:37.010
<v Speaker 4>I mean there has to be a correlation</v>
<v Speaker 4>between something that's extra fast and</v>

350
00:14:37.011 --> 00:14:39.500
<v Speaker 4>extra delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really think there is.</v>

351
00:14:40.190 --> 00:14:43.040
<v Speaker 4>Well does that make sense?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not really.</v>

352
00:14:43.041 --> 00:14:45.230
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because like I dunno what to eat a</v>

353
00:14:45.231 --> 00:14:48.740
<v Speaker 4>hummingbird probably tastes like shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think a lot of it's their diet and how</v>

354
00:14:48.741 --> 00:14:51.590
<v Speaker 4>much they're actually having to move</v>
<v Speaker 4>too.</v>

355
00:14:52.170 --> 00:14:54.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause I think things that are running a</v>

356
00:14:54.081 --> 00:14:57.560
<v Speaker 2>lot like full speed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems like the meat maybe isn't as</v>

357
00:14:57.561 --> 00:14:59.720
<v Speaker 2>tinder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's hard to say.</v>

358
00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:01.580
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well.</v>

359
00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:04.610
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I've found is that Chad ward</v>

360
00:15:04.611 --> 00:15:06.680
<v Speaker 2>method,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the your your friend whiskey bent</v>

361
00:15:06.681 --> 00:15:09.350
<v Speaker 2>barbecue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's changed the way I cook meat.</v>

362
00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:12.740
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do that here now and I use a meat</v>

363
00:15:12.741 --> 00:15:13.820
<v Speaker 2>thermometer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Always.</v>

364
00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:18.940
<v Speaker 2>The only time I don't is when I um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will saute backstraps slices or steak</v>

365
00:15:20.181 --> 00:15:23.630
<v Speaker 2>slices in a frying pan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a cast iron grill.</v>

366
00:15:23.631 --> 00:15:27.590
<v Speaker 2>I'll put some butter and some garlic</v>
<v Speaker 2>salt and some cracked pepper and I'll</v>

367
00:15:27.591 --> 00:15:29.870
<v Speaker 2>just cook them pretty quick on a really</v>
<v Speaker 2>hot skillet.</v>

368
00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:31.760
<v Speaker 2>I like cooking like that too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

369
00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:34.670
<v Speaker 2>But when I cook like a roast or</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that or a thick piece of</v>

370
00:15:34.671 --> 00:15:36.710
<v Speaker 2>meat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always use Chad's method.</v>

371
00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:38.690
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a way to go get it,</v>

372
00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:40.010
<v Speaker 2>get the internal temperature.</v>

373
00:15:40.010 --> 00:15:44.390
<v Speaker 2>I get it to around one 20 and then I</v>
<v Speaker 2>take it out and just sear the outside</v>

374
00:15:44.391 --> 00:15:46.430
<v Speaker 2>and the frying pan and let it sit for 10</v>
<v Speaker 2>minutes.</v>

375
00:15:46.431 --> 00:15:49.310
<v Speaker 2>And Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one thing that a lot of people don't</v>

376
00:15:49.311 --> 00:15:50.660
<v Speaker 2>realize too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

377
00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:54.680
<v Speaker 2>when it comes to cooking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a really good roast or a steak or</v>

378
00:15:54.681 --> 00:15:59.681
<v Speaker 2>anything is I love having those soft</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeti bags or the smaller cooler.</v>

379
00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:03.110
<v Speaker 2>And I'll take the stuff and actually you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

380
00:16:03.130 --> 00:16:06.710
<v Speaker 2>kind of wrap it up just slightly and</v>
<v Speaker 2>foiler but your paper and then put it in</v>

381
00:16:06.711 --> 00:16:11.030
<v Speaker 2>the cooler and let it actually stage in</v>
<v Speaker 2>there and you know,</v>

382
00:16:11.031 --> 00:16:15.320
<v Speaker 2>and just stage in that moisture while</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing my vegetables cause it takes</v>

383
00:16:15.321 --> 00:16:19.610
<v Speaker 2>about 20 minutes to do vegetables and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then take it out right at the very end</v>

384
00:16:19.611 --> 00:16:22.310
<v Speaker 2>to do that reverse year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Normally when I put it in there,</v>

385
00:16:22.311 --> 00:16:24.170
<v Speaker 2>it gives me time to get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

386
00:16:24.171 --> 00:16:27.410
<v Speaker 2>a cast iron pan hot enough with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>butter to do reverse sear.</v>

387
00:16:27.770 --> 00:16:29.810
<v Speaker 2>So it's like really good for timing and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

388
00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:33.710
<v Speaker 2>it really helps break down that that</v>
<v Speaker 2>protein a little bit and it just makes</v>

389
00:16:33.711 --> 00:16:36.440
<v Speaker 2>it that much more tender.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting because I was doing</v>

390
00:16:36.441 --> 00:16:39.140
<v Speaker 2>that for a while but I was doing it</v>
<v Speaker 2>after I did the seer.</v>

391
00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:42.320
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was taking it right from the grill and</v>

392
00:16:42.321 --> 00:16:44.570
<v Speaker 2>then I was searing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I'd have the Pan Ready,</v>

393
00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:47.630
<v Speaker 2>I'd see her right off the grill and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd wrap it in foil and put it into yet.</v>

394
00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:50.450
<v Speaker 2>But then you don't get kind of that</v>
<v Speaker 2>crispness of this year,</v>

395
00:16:50.451 --> 00:16:53.240
<v Speaker 2>which he like were at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it stays moist until you're</v>

396
00:16:53.241 --> 00:16:54.074
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

397
00:16:54.130 --> 00:16:56.960
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stage at first start your vege and then</v>

398
00:16:56.961 --> 00:16:59.600
<v Speaker 2>like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably two minutes before you feel</v>

399
00:16:59.601 --> 00:17:01.130
<v Speaker 2>like you're going to pull your</v>
<v Speaker 2>vegetables off.</v>

400
00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:05.900
<v Speaker 2>Just get that butter going in that cast</v>
<v Speaker 2>iron pan and then do your reverse here.</v>

401
00:17:06.010 --> 00:17:08.900
<v Speaker 2>You know you can do one side and then as</v>
<v Speaker 2>soon as you flip it,</v>

402
00:17:08.901 --> 00:17:11.720
<v Speaker 2>pull your veggies off the grill and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're literally,</v>

403
00:17:11.810 --> 00:17:14.810
<v Speaker 2>you can go right back to the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know that one side,</v>

404
00:17:14.811 --> 00:17:17.720
<v Speaker 2>your reverse sear and take it off and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're serving hot.</v>

405
00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:20.690
<v Speaker 2>Everything's done well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one thing that I really give</v>

406
00:17:20.691 --> 00:17:22.220
<v Speaker 2>credit to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Steve Rinella.</v>

407
00:17:22.550 --> 00:17:26.270
<v Speaker 2>Steve Rinella really got me interested</v>
<v Speaker 2>in wild game cooking.</v>

408
00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:29.300
<v Speaker 2>And then Hank Shaw,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who he had on his TV show who's a</v>

409
00:17:29.690 --> 00:17:32.720
<v Speaker 2>brilliant chef and he's gay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got a couple of books out.</v>

410
00:17:33.410 --> 00:17:37.340
<v Speaker 2>One of them is buck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Buck Moose I think,</v>

411
00:17:37.341 --> 00:17:39.610
<v Speaker 2>and then he's got another one duck moose</v>
<v Speaker 2>or something.</v>

412
00:17:39.611 --> 00:17:42.110
<v Speaker 2>So I had it sitting here for a while til</v>
<v Speaker 2>we moved everything off.</v>

413
00:17:42.111 --> 00:17:43.790
<v Speaker 2>This stable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's table gets so cluttered.</v>

414
00:17:43.791 --> 00:17:46.930
<v Speaker 2>I'm always trying to put,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone has always given me books and</v>

415
00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:50.160
<v Speaker 2>also there was just sitting here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just got one.</v>

416
00:17:50.590 --> 00:17:53.430
<v Speaker 4>They're always just stacking up and I've</v>
<v Speaker 4>been meaning to give you this book.</v>

417
00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:56.130
<v Speaker 4>Moose recipes and techniques for cooking</v>
<v Speaker 4>deer,</v>

418
00:17:56.131 --> 00:17:57.900
<v Speaker 4>elk,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and Moose by Hank Shaw.</v>

419
00:17:57.930 --> 00:17:59.220
<v Speaker 4>It's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's really good.</v>

420
00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:01.170
<v Speaker 4>I'd be no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his book's really good too.</v>

421
00:18:01.171 --> 00:18:04.290
<v Speaker 4>He's got two of them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hunting and cooking wild game.</v>

422
00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:09.980
<v Speaker 7>I feel I'm so inferior to those guys</v>
<v Speaker 7>when it comes to cooking.</v>

423
00:18:10.830 --> 00:18:14.260
<v Speaker 7>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But I almost liked the fact that that</v>

424
00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:18.810
<v Speaker 7>people really like my cooking or at</v>
<v Speaker 7>least the pictures and what I make,</v>

425
00:18:18.811 --> 00:18:23.811
<v Speaker 7>people are really into it because if</v>
<v Speaker 7>they knew that my knowledge of cooking</v>

426
00:18:24.151 --> 00:18:26.760
<v Speaker 7>wild game is so limited,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's,</v>

427
00:18:26.910 --> 00:18:30.060
<v Speaker 7>it should be hope for anybody to be able</v>
<v Speaker 7>to cook that easy.</v>

428
00:18:30.061 --> 00:18:32.850
<v Speaker 7>Because I'm not those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

429
00:18:32.851 --> 00:18:33.790
<v Speaker 7>I think if,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

430
00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:38.430
<v Speaker 7>I would love to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but I'm as simple as it gets when it</v>

431
00:18:38.431 --> 00:18:40.470
<v Speaker 7>comes to to grill and stuff.</v>

432
00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:42.730
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I'm telling you there's an art to</v>

433
00:18:42.731 --> 00:18:45.730
<v Speaker 4>that simplicity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like just you describing your method</v>

434
00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:46.541
<v Speaker 4>for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

435
00:18:46.541 --> 00:18:50.320
<v Speaker 4>like letting it stage and then searing</v>
<v Speaker 4>it and what we learned from Chad when we</v>

436
00:18:50.321 --> 00:18:51.900
<v Speaker 4>cook that wild pig.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>

437
00:18:52.150 --> 00:18:54.640
<v Speaker 4>That was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was so good.</v>

438
00:18:54.850 --> 00:18:58.090
<v Speaker 4>And I think there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's something amazing in that</v>

439
00:18:58.091 --> 00:19:00.730
<v Speaker 4>simplicity because a lot of people fuck</v>
<v Speaker 4>that simplicity up.</v>

440
00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:03.730
<v Speaker 4>Like that simplicity is a real common</v>
<v Speaker 4>one to screw up.</v>

441
00:19:03.731 --> 00:19:07.120
<v Speaker 4>People just overdo it or overcook it or</v>
<v Speaker 4>something goes wrong.</v>

442
00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:11.740
<v Speaker 4>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Rinella really turned me on to all the</v>

443
00:19:11.741 --> 00:19:15.580
<v Speaker 4>various really fascinating dishes and he</v>
<v Speaker 4>had several episodes of his TV show</v>

444
00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:17.980
<v Speaker 4>mediator that are just dedicated to</v>
<v Speaker 4>cooking.</v>

445
00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:20.530
<v Speaker 4>And I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's not a lot of hunting shows that</v>

446
00:19:20.531 --> 00:19:23.050
<v Speaker 4>ever have that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's always just about hunting and then</v>

447
00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:26.890
<v Speaker 4>the shot of the animal getting shot and</v>
<v Speaker 4>then everybody's smiling and high five</v>

448
00:19:26.950 --> 00:19:29.290
<v Speaker 4>and that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Roll credits when it's pretty much,</v>

449
00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:32.020
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>60 70% of all those hunting shows and</v>

450
00:19:32.021 --> 00:19:34.040
<v Speaker 4>his really stands out because it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

451
00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:36.160
<v Speaker 4>this guy's a real chef.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

452
00:19:36.161 --> 00:19:37.930
<v Speaker 4>it's an amateur chef,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he's a real chef.</v>

453
00:19:37.931 --> 00:19:40.930
<v Speaker 4>He knows a lot about cooking and he</v>
<v Speaker 4>makes these delicious meals and they're</v>

454
00:19:40.931 --> 00:19:41.531
<v Speaker 4>intricate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It like,</v>

455
00:19:41.531 --> 00:19:43.270
<v Speaker 4>it makes us really cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Elk Meat Loaf,</v>

456
00:19:43.410 --> 00:19:44.410
<v Speaker 4>it was really good.</v>

457
00:19:44.770 --> 00:19:47.020
<v Speaker 7>I've never done anything with Steve.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We've,</v>

458
00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:49.960
<v Speaker 7>we've passed,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we've actually been within the same</v>

459
00:19:49.961 --> 00:19:53.650
<v Speaker 7>group of friends talking at times,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but we've never actually done something</v>

460
00:19:53.651 --> 00:19:57.340
<v Speaker 7>where we had to have a communication</v>
<v Speaker 7>just the two of us.</v>

461
00:19:57.730 --> 00:19:58.690
<v Speaker 7>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>

462
00:19:58.691 --> 00:20:00.550
<v Speaker 7>he's a fascinating dude.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Very,</v>

463
00:20:00.551 --> 00:20:02.500
<v Speaker 7>very smart guy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I would love to actually,</v>

464
00:20:02.501 --> 00:20:07.150
<v Speaker 7>I talked with a remi and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I told Remy,</v>

465
00:20:07.151 --> 00:20:09.800
<v Speaker 7>I said I would love to do,</v>
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

466
00:20:10.150 --> 00:20:14.590
<v Speaker 7>just a weekend getaway where we just go</v>
<v Speaker 7>back country and all you teach,</v>

467
00:20:14.620 --> 00:20:15.510
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>just Kinda,</v>

468
00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:18.040
<v Speaker 7>I want to just follow remy and see some</v>
<v Speaker 7>of his,</v>

469
00:20:18.070 --> 00:20:19.390
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>just as natural,</v>

470
00:20:19.391 --> 00:20:24.391
<v Speaker 7>like camping and survival type skills</v>
<v Speaker 7>and then actually do an on the mounting</v>

471
00:20:25.780 --> 00:20:29.530
<v Speaker 7>coaching thing with Remi.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We were talking about doing a show where</v>

472
00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:34.920
<v Speaker 7>I literally retrain his way of shooting</v>
<v Speaker 7>while he's retraining my way of back</v>

473
00:20:36.311 --> 00:20:40.090
<v Speaker 7>country hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And literally he's doing his element.</v>

474
00:20:40.091 --> 00:20:43.540
<v Speaker 7>I'm doing mine and we're able to to just</v>
<v Speaker 7>do it in the middle of nowhere.</v>

475
00:20:43.570 --> 00:20:44.710
<v Speaker 7>That sounds cool.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

476
00:20:44.711 --> 00:20:45.544
<v Speaker 7>it'd be pretty fun.</v>

477
00:20:45.570 --> 00:20:48.250
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm really fascinated by what remi does</v>

478
00:20:48.490 --> 00:20:51.400
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tim Barnett and a bunch of those guys</v>

479
00:20:51.790 --> 00:20:52.980
<v Speaker 1>that have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

480
00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:57.010
<v Speaker 1>really taken up solo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>back hunt,</v>

481
00:20:57.040 --> 00:21:02.040
<v Speaker 1>back country hunting where they backpack</v>
<v Speaker 1>in and they'll go in 20 miles with a</v>

482
00:21:02.531 --> 00:21:03.430
<v Speaker 1>backpack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

483
00:21:03.431 --> 00:21:05.210
<v Speaker 1>obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

484
00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:07.240
<v Speaker 1>my favorite stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Adam Green tree,</v>

485
00:21:07.241 --> 00:21:10.450
<v Speaker 1>that fucking crazy bastard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our good friend Adam went all the way</v>

486
00:21:10.930 --> 00:21:14.380
<v Speaker 1>deep into the mountains of Colorado and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then again he went,</v>

487
00:21:14.381 --> 00:21:16.120
<v Speaker 1>came out for a bit and went to Idaho,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

488
00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:17.530
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's when he had all the Grizzly</v>

489
00:21:17.531 --> 00:21:20.140
<v Speaker 1>and counters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but 28 days just living out of a</v>

490
00:21:20.141 --> 00:21:24.040
<v Speaker 1>backpack and putting his camp on its</v>
<v Speaker 1>back most of the nights and just</v>

491
00:21:24.041 --> 00:21:27.700
<v Speaker 1>carrying it around and just living</v>
<v Speaker 1>literally off your back.</v>

492
00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:31.120
<v Speaker 1>And there's an art to that and remmy</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't just do that,</v>

493
00:21:31.121 --> 00:21:33.160
<v Speaker 1>but he also solo films,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything,</v>

494
00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:35.290
<v Speaker 1>which is incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's,</v>

495
00:21:35.470 --> 00:21:36.303
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

496
00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:41.340
<v Speaker 2>I don't solo back country hunt that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>definitely have really.</v>

497
00:21:43.031 --> 00:21:46.480
<v Speaker 2>Most of my tv show experience has all</v>
<v Speaker 2>been from cell filming.</v>

498
00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:48.610
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been doing it 20 something years.</v>

499
00:21:49.150 --> 00:21:51.730
<v Speaker 2>A lot of what you saw for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was all self filmed,</v>

500
00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:56.760
<v Speaker 2>which a lot of people don't appreciate</v>
<v Speaker 2>how tough that really is until,</v>

501
00:21:57.240 --> 00:21:59.080
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it is hard.</v>

502
00:21:59.290 --> 00:22:00.940
<v Speaker 2>It's hard enough to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

503
00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:04.630
<v Speaker 2>to hunt and be successful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But to film it is like a whole</v>

504
00:22:04.650 --> 00:22:05.810
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>new level.</v>

505
00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:07.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just to bring the cameras around with</v>

506
00:22:07.371 --> 00:22:08.600
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like with Remi,</v>

507
00:22:08.630 --> 00:22:11.370
<v Speaker 1>like if we're watching a show solo</v>
<v Speaker 1>hunter or timber nat,</v>

508
00:22:11.380 --> 00:22:14.030
<v Speaker 1>the other guy that's on each other</v>
<v Speaker 1>always like holding the tripod,</v>

509
00:22:14.031 --> 00:22:17.120
<v Speaker 1>running up the hill while they're also</v>
<v Speaker 1>holding a bow and setting it up and</v>

510
00:22:17.121 --> 00:22:20.150
<v Speaker 1>putting the camera in place and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to draw back and trying to get</v>

511
00:22:20.170 --> 00:22:22.260
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and move the camera because the deer's</v>

512
00:22:22.261 --> 00:22:27.261
<v Speaker 1>move in like Gopros helped a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just fascinated by the people that</v>

513
00:22:29.001 --> 00:22:33.380
<v Speaker 1>choose to go deep into the woods and</v>
<v Speaker 1>live by themselves and do it for long,</v>

514
00:22:33.381 --> 00:22:35.240
<v Speaker 1>long periods of time because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

515
00:22:36.170 --> 00:22:40.550
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a very interesting and solitary</v>

516
00:22:40.551 --> 00:22:42.710
<v Speaker 1>pursuit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when you're out there,</v>

517
00:22:43.370 --> 00:22:45.860
<v Speaker 1>there's no TV,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no phones,</v>

518
00:22:45.861 --> 00:22:48.200
<v Speaker 1>there's just you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you only,</v>

519
00:22:48.201 --> 00:22:51.320
<v Speaker 1>and a backpack and a little tent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe a baby.</v>

520
00:22:51.530 --> 00:22:55.010
<v Speaker 1>You're sleeping under the stars and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get up in the morning and do it all</v>

521
00:22:55.011 --> 00:22:56.420
<v Speaker 1>over again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And some of these guys do it for like</v>

522
00:22:56.421 --> 00:22:57.860
<v Speaker 1>20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>30 days at a time.</v>

523
00:22:57.890 --> 00:22:58.723
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

524
00:22:58.950 --> 00:23:00.690
<v Speaker 2>It's hard for me to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

525
00:23:00.780 --> 00:23:05.780
<v Speaker 2>I don't actually like to post.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even if I'm out camping on a</v>

526
00:23:06.601 --> 00:23:09.180
<v Speaker 2>hunt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually don't post when I'm doing</v>

527
00:23:09.181 --> 00:23:13.680
<v Speaker 2>that just because of those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Out of respect for those guys,</v>

528
00:23:13.710 --> 00:23:15.180
<v Speaker 2>it's who really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>

529
00:23:15.181 --> 00:23:16.230
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

530
00:23:16.231 --> 00:23:17.280
<v Speaker 2>honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

531
00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:21.420
<v Speaker 2>I understand what they're doing and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't,</v>

532
00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:23.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's no different than,</v>

533
00:23:23.550 --> 00:23:24.383
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

534
00:23:24.390 --> 00:23:29.330
<v Speaker 2>there's people that post photos shooting</v>
<v Speaker 2>archery when,</v>

535
00:23:29.450 --> 00:23:31.440
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I look back and see how long</v>

536
00:23:31.441 --> 00:23:32.770
<v Speaker 2>they've really done it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

537
00:23:33.270 --> 00:23:36.990
<v Speaker 2>they build up a persona,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's also guys,</v>

538
00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:39.510
<v Speaker 2>there's guys that have done it twice as</v>
<v Speaker 2>long as me,</v>

539
00:23:39.511 --> 00:23:42.030
<v Speaker 2>but there's guys like me that have done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

540
00:23:42.210 --> 00:23:45.440
<v Speaker 2>possibly millions of arrows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

541
00:23:45.441 --> 00:23:47.270
<v Speaker 2>so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to,</v>

542
00:23:48.110 --> 00:23:51.100
<v Speaker 2>to see people like make pretend to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

543
00:23:51.410 --> 00:23:53.690
<v Speaker 2>And I feel like I'm that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I,</v>

544
00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:58.580
<v Speaker 2>if I post a picture of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of me out in the back country in a Bibi,</v>

545
00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:04.960
<v Speaker 2>it's not the same as seeing Adam posts a</v>
<v Speaker 2>picture and a bivy or remy or Rinella.</v>

546
00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:07.620
<v Speaker 2>We should explain a Bibi that people</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't know what it is.</v>

547
00:24:07.950 --> 00:24:11.510
<v Speaker 2>It's like a combination tent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sleeping bag.</v>

548
00:24:11.540 --> 00:24:12.490
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

549
00:24:12.510 --> 00:24:14.750
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's like literally you can get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

550
00:24:14.751 --> 00:24:18.360
<v Speaker 2>you can stuff it in your bag,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go out and you're more or less a</v>

551
00:24:18.370 --> 00:24:20.170
<v Speaker 2>hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just lay it on the ground,</v>

552
00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:22.700
<v Speaker 2>sleeping on the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got some little bit of cover.</v>

553
00:24:23.210 --> 00:24:25.550
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes people bring pads,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes the hard,</v>

554
00:24:25.551 --> 00:24:28.010
<v Speaker 2>hard hardcore dudes don't even bring</v>
<v Speaker 2>pads.</v>

555
00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:29.990
<v Speaker 2>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That guy is shooting Alan Yang.</v>

556
00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:33.650
<v Speaker 2>That's how I wake up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wake up and Oh,</v>

557
00:24:33.651 --> 00:24:36.030
<v Speaker 2>I hear an elk wake and bake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

558
00:24:37.670 --> 00:24:39.570
<v Speaker 2>Breakfast is served.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

559
00:24:39.620 --> 00:24:42.470
<v Speaker 2>Well that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's all got Cammo on the Bibi too.</v>

560
00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:44.440
<v Speaker 2>Can you appreciate that though?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

561
00:24:44.450 --> 00:24:47.270
<v Speaker 2>I feel that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not just in the hunting world.</v>

562
00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:50.390
<v Speaker 2>It's like that with a lot of things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

563
00:24:50.510 --> 00:24:52.090
<v Speaker 2>but you know why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I have a truck,</v>

564
00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:54.680
<v Speaker 2>I have trouble posting pictures working</v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

565
00:24:55.490 --> 00:24:56.470
<v Speaker 2>I know what you mean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

566
00:24:56.600 --> 00:24:59.870
<v Speaker 2>Like I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I make sure I make sure people that are</v>

567
00:24:59.871 --> 00:25:04.580
<v Speaker 2>following me and trying to maybe be</v>
<v Speaker 2>motivated by what my daily routine is.</v>

568
00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:08.450
<v Speaker 2>I like them to see that I'm going and</v>
<v Speaker 2>things like that.</v>

569
00:25:08.451 --> 00:25:13.451
<v Speaker 2>But to actually post that I'm doing it</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I do it to stay healthy.</v>

570
00:25:13.790 --> 00:25:15.710
<v Speaker 2>It's not my life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

571
00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:19.640
<v Speaker 2>And archery is my life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's why sometimes it gets hard for</v>

572
00:25:19.641 --> 00:25:23.060
<v Speaker 2>me when people are pretending to do that</v>
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>

573
00:25:23.330 --> 00:25:25.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I guess I don't have a problem with</v>

574
00:25:25.101 --> 00:25:28.190
<v Speaker 2>people doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't want him to do it.</v>

575
00:25:28.220 --> 00:25:30.110
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to be enthusiastic about</v>

576
00:25:30.111 --> 00:25:30.944
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I know what you're saying.</v>

577
00:25:31.010 --> 00:25:32.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

578
00:25:32.750 --> 00:25:37.700
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to show respect for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that are literally putting in the</v>

579
00:25:37.701 --> 00:25:42.701
<v Speaker 2>grind for those specific things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The same as what I have done with my</v>

580
00:25:43.101 --> 00:25:45.500
<v Speaker 2>life or archery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's all I'm saying.</v>

581
00:25:45.530 --> 00:25:46.220
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly,</v>

582
00:25:46.220 --> 00:25:47.053
<v Speaker 2>Sam.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

583
00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:48.940
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I dunno.</v>

584
00:25:48.950 --> 00:25:51.020
<v Speaker 2>I have a different attitude about that</v>
<v Speaker 2>with standup comedy.</v>

585
00:25:51.830 --> 00:25:52.600
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

586
00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:54.760
<v Speaker 1>cause I really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really like when new people get into</v>

587
00:25:54.761 --> 00:25:57.760
<v Speaker 1>standup comedy and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's contrary to like how a lot of</v>

588
00:25:57.761 --> 00:26:00.040
<v Speaker 1>professionals feel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I was talking to a friend of mine</v>

589
00:26:00.041 --> 00:26:02.350
<v Speaker 1>the other day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's very funny and she was telling me</v>

590
00:26:02.351 --> 00:26:05.800
<v Speaker 1>that her uncle was a thinking about</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting into comedy and she was like,</v>

591
00:26:05.830 --> 00:26:08.500
<v Speaker 1>oh well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh God,</v>

592
00:26:08.501 --> 00:26:09.670
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know.</v>

593
00:26:09.671 --> 00:26:12.670
<v Speaker 1>But when people ask me like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>

594
00:26:12.671 --> 00:26:13.870
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking about doing comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

595
00:26:13.871 --> 00:26:15.670
<v Speaker 1>you could do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anybody can do it.</v>

596
00:26:15.671 --> 00:26:17.440
<v Speaker 1>Just figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just like everything else.</v>

597
00:26:17.710 --> 00:26:20.620
<v Speaker 1>It's like Jujitsu or</v>

598
00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:22.093
<v Speaker 2>mm.</v>

599
00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:24.170
<v Speaker 1>Martial arts like fit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fill in the blank.</v>

600
00:26:24.171 --> 00:26:26.480
<v Speaker 1>It's anything else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like music.</v>

601
00:26:26.510 --> 00:26:28.670
<v Speaker 1>You learn the chords.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You figured out how to play,</v>

602
00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:30.800
<v Speaker 1>you can do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might not be able to do it,</v>

603
00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:34.220
<v Speaker 1>but that might be on you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean like whether or not,</v>

604
00:26:34.260 --> 00:26:38.810
<v Speaker 1>I think if you're a rational person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he thinks and you like comedy and people</v>

605
00:26:38.811 --> 00:26:40.250
<v Speaker 1>laugh at you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you say funny shit.</v>

606
00:26:40.251 --> 00:26:42.920
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you can be a stand up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will you?</v>

607
00:26:43.230 --> 00:26:45.150
<v Speaker 1>Will you do it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

608
00:26:45.270 --> 00:26:47.310
<v Speaker 1>People think it's a lot easier than it</v>
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

609
00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:49.230
<v Speaker 1>They don't really know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't see,</v>

610
00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:52.350
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no way you could.</v>

611
00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:54.390
<v Speaker 1>There's no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you think about all the hours,</v>

612
00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:56.490
<v Speaker 1>all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the different sets.</v>

613
00:26:56.491 --> 00:27:00.270
<v Speaker 1>But I like it when people get into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if some new kid has only been doing</v>

614
00:27:00.271 --> 00:27:02.400
<v Speaker 1>comedy for three weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>throws a bunch of pictures on his</v>

615
00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:04.800
<v Speaker 1>instagram page about going to an open</v>
<v Speaker 1>mic,</v>

616
00:27:04.801 --> 00:27:05.634
<v Speaker 1>died,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm happy.</v>

617
00:27:05.790 --> 00:27:07.050
<v Speaker 1>Like go get it kid.</v>

618
00:27:07.580 --> 00:27:10.160
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean especially when it comes to art</v>

619
00:27:10.161 --> 00:27:11.870
<v Speaker 2>form,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's kind of a line there.</v>

620
00:27:11.871 --> 00:27:14.390
<v Speaker 2>Cause when it comes to competition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm very,</v>

621
00:27:14.391 --> 00:27:19.391
<v Speaker 2>very</v>
<v Speaker 2>active in getting people involved with</v>

622
00:27:19.941 --> 00:27:23.120
<v Speaker 2>trying to compete because I always felt</v>
<v Speaker 2>like even as a coach,</v>

623
00:27:23.570 --> 00:27:28.040
<v Speaker 2>when I helped people that were maybe not</v>
<v Speaker 2>up to the rank that I was,</v>

624
00:27:28.310 --> 00:27:32.150
<v Speaker 2>I felt like once I felt the pressure of</v>
<v Speaker 2>them pushing on my heels,</v>

625
00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:36.200
<v Speaker 2>it always elevated my game for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I've got friends that,</v>

626
00:27:36.650 --> 00:27:41.090
<v Speaker 2>I've got friends that are within</v>
<v Speaker 2>different fields that I'm in.</v>

627
00:27:41.270 --> 00:27:44.030
<v Speaker 2>And they actually have came to me and</v>
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>

628
00:27:44.390 --> 00:27:46.340
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we want to show you exactly how we're</v>

629
00:27:46.341 --> 00:27:47.870
<v Speaker 2>doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

630
00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:53.320
<v Speaker 2>and in a way I'm a competitor because</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm in the outdoor business,</v>

631
00:27:54.380 --> 00:27:57.500
<v Speaker 2>but there's been a few times where some</v>
<v Speaker 2>of my friends have said,</v>

632
00:27:57.501 --> 00:28:02.480
<v Speaker 2>the reason we're telling you exactly how</v>
<v Speaker 2>we do it is because we know that you're</v>

633
00:28:02.481 --> 00:28:05.210
<v Speaker 2>going to do it different,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but maybe a little bit better.</v>

634
00:28:05.270 --> 00:28:07.550
<v Speaker 2>And some of them have said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're stale right now.</v>

635
00:28:07.551 --> 00:28:11.780
<v Speaker 2>We know we're stale,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need to push and we need someone to</v>

636
00:28:11.781 --> 00:28:16.030
<v Speaker 2>like push past us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that will our competitive drive</v>

637
00:28:16.031 --> 00:28:17.330
<v Speaker 2>we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll push through.</v>

638
00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:18.220
<v Speaker 2>Well you know what,</v>

639
00:28:18.220 --> 00:28:21.630
<v Speaker 1>in the outdoor business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm going to steal a page from my</v>

640
00:28:21.631 --> 00:28:24.930
<v Speaker 1>friend Sturgis book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not a real book,</v>

641
00:28:24.931 --> 00:28:26.460
<v Speaker 1>but we said the other day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

642
00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:28.500
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not really in the music business.</v>

643
00:28:28.501 --> 00:28:31.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm in the sturgill Simpson business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

644
00:28:31.231 --> 00:28:33.690
<v Speaker 1>damn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

645
00:28:33.691 --> 00:28:36.480
<v Speaker 1>He's right because I'm not in show</v>
<v Speaker 1>business.</v>

646
00:28:36.540 --> 00:28:38.370
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in the Joe Rogan business.</v>

647
00:28:38.460 --> 00:28:41.460
<v Speaker 1>100% like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm in show business in terms of</v>

648
00:28:41.461 --> 00:28:44.070
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess I work for the UFC,</v>

649
00:28:44.610 --> 00:28:46.040
<v Speaker 1>that's show business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

650
00:28:46.041 --> 00:28:47.700
<v Speaker 1>I show up at the comedy store that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>show business.</v>

651
00:28:47.701 --> 00:28:49.080
<v Speaker 1>But that's where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's my gym.</v>

652

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where I'm practicing to be in the</v>

653
00:28:50.881 --> 00:28:53.790
<v Speaker 1>Joe Rogan business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're in the John Dudley business,</v>

654
00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:57.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean what I was saying before,</v>

655
00:28:57.781 --> 00:29:00.030
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to let you continue your</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought,</v>

656
00:29:00.031 --> 00:29:04.320
<v Speaker 1>but what I wanted to say was the you</v>
<v Speaker 1>feel that way because you're a legit</v>

657
00:29:04.321 --> 00:29:05.130
<v Speaker 1>guy.</v>

658
00:29:05.130 --> 00:29:08.370
<v Speaker 1>Cause like what you've done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a lot of people don't realize</v>

659
00:29:08.700 --> 00:29:11.880
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of people in the archery</v>
<v Speaker 1>world and there's a lot of people in the</v>

660
00:29:11.881 --> 00:29:15.210
<v Speaker 1>bow hunting world to talk about bow</v>
<v Speaker 1>hunting and they were really into our</v>

661
00:29:15.211 --> 00:29:19.170
<v Speaker 1>tree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But your background as a competitive</v>

662
00:29:19.171 --> 00:29:21.690
<v Speaker 1>archer is just insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you really,</v>

663
00:29:21.691 --> 00:29:22.800
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most people don't even know,</v>

664
00:29:23.010 --> 00:29:25.800
<v Speaker 1>like you really did it all over the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

665
00:29:25.860 --> 00:29:29.130
<v Speaker 1>I mean you compete internationally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you flew millions of miles.</v>

666
00:29:29.131 --> 00:29:31.520
<v Speaker 1>I mean that you did the whole deal and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

667
00:29:31.770 --> 00:29:36.660
<v Speaker 1>it's something that you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of the fact that you know,</v>

668
00:29:36.661 --> 00:29:40.950
<v Speaker 1>you put so much effort and so much hard</v>
<v Speaker 1>work into it and you're solidified as</v>

669
00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:44.920
<v Speaker 1>100% legit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're very sensitive to things that</v>

670
00:29:44.921 --> 00:29:48.160
<v Speaker 1>you're not legit in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's why you're a very authentic</v>

671
00:29:48.161 --> 00:29:50.170
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when you're thinking about like all</v>

672
00:29:50.171 --> 00:29:52.480
<v Speaker 1>the running,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when I post pictures of running,</v>

673
00:29:52.510 --> 00:29:54.130
<v Speaker 1>I often think like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

674
00:29:54.131 --> 00:29:56.530
<v Speaker 1>I'm running but I don't even have like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>real job.</v>

675

<v Speaker 1>my best friends.</v>

677
00:30:01.690 --> 00:30:05.350
<v Speaker 1>It's like I can't really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't really think that I'm really</v>

678
00:30:05.351 --> 00:30:06.820
<v Speaker 1>run.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I know I'm doing it,</v>

679
00:30:06.821 --> 00:30:08.110
<v Speaker 1>but it's bitch ass running.</v>

680
00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:11.390
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want to use that example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but to do an example,</v>

681
00:30:11.420 --> 00:30:13.860
<v Speaker 2>that is the perfect example because</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

682
00:30:13.970 --> 00:30:17.900
<v Speaker 2>I don't post pictures of me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yesterday I actually did arm day.</v>

683
00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:21.980
<v Speaker 2>I'm not like arm day all the time,</v>

<v Speaker 2>legs?</v>

<v Speaker 2>well I shouldn't say my entire life when</v>

00:30:55.640 --> 00:30:58.070
<v Speaker 2>for the most part I've shot a right</v>
<v Speaker 2>handed boat my whole life.</v>

697
00:30:58.070 --> 00:30:59.600
<v Speaker 2>So my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my left,</v>

698
00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:03.410
<v Speaker 2>I mean my left Pec is bigger than my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>than my right.</v>

699
00:31:03.830 --> 00:31:05.120
<v Speaker 2>My left jelled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

700
00:31:05.121 --> 00:31:08.180
<v Speaker 2>my left tricep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then on my right side,</v>

701
00:31:08.300 --> 00:31:12.380
<v Speaker 2>my right trap,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way my whole right side sits in my</v>

702
00:31:12.381 --> 00:31:17.180
<v Speaker 2>bicep or also from pulling a boat my</v>
<v Speaker 2>entire life.</v>

703
00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:20.150
<v Speaker 2>And you and I talked about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

704
00:31:20.270 --> 00:31:23.120
<v Speaker 2>if you really wanted to balance yourself</v>
<v Speaker 2>and stay symmetrical,</v>

705
00:31:23.121 --> 00:31:26.360
<v Speaker 2>you almost need to shoot lefthanded as</v>
<v Speaker 2>much as you shoot right hand.</v>

706
00:31:26.361 --> 00:31:28.280
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's the key with martial arts.</v>

707
00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:31.310
<v Speaker 2>But in a way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that is what Cam's doing.</v>

708
00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.850
<v Speaker 2>He's running right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all lower body.</v>

709
00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:39.410
<v Speaker 2>And then he's literally lifting upper</v>
<v Speaker 2>body every day,</v>

710
00:31:39.470 --> 00:31:42.470
<v Speaker 2>which is a balance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

711
00:31:42.471 --> 00:31:44.600
<v Speaker 2>people are going to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are definitely going to say,</v>

712
00:31:44.601 --> 00:31:46.040
<v Speaker 2>well you can't train up her body every</v>
<v Speaker 2>day,</v>

713
00:31:46.041 --> 00:31:49.460
<v Speaker 2>but he trains lower body every day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So is it like,</v>

714
00:31:49.461 --> 00:31:50.540
<v Speaker 2>I've thought that many times</v>

715
00:31:51.510 --> 00:31:53.340
<v Speaker 1>low weight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>high reps,</v>

716
00:31:53.460 --> 00:31:55.320
<v Speaker 1>not always so low either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the way.</v>

717
00:31:55.321 --> 00:31:58.440
<v Speaker 1>That kind of strong as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you'd be kind of stunned and how</v>

718
00:31:58.450 --> 00:32:01.030
<v Speaker 1>strong he is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he came over here and uh,</v>

719
00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:04.710
<v Speaker 1>he picked up my hundred and 25 pound</v>
<v Speaker 1>dumbbells and he was doing presses.</v>

720
00:32:04.860 --> 00:32:07.890
<v Speaker 1>So he's pressing to 50 with dumbbells,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

721
00:32:07.891 --> 00:32:08.724
<v Speaker 1>and he's,</v>

722
00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:10.233
<v Speaker 2>it mean</v>

723
00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:12.080
<v Speaker 1>is it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a crazy guy.</v>

724
00:32:12.290 --> 00:32:14.600
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't know anybody like him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like he's doing,</v>

725
00:32:14.660 --> 00:32:17.090
<v Speaker 1>he's doing low weight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>high rep running.</v>

726
00:32:17.270 --> 00:32:20.330
<v Speaker 1>He's doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I'm saying he also lifts to 50 with</v>

727
00:32:20.331 --> 00:32:23.480
<v Speaker 1>dumbbells and he only weighs like 175</v>
<v Speaker 1>pounds.</v>

728
00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:25.010
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty crazy shit.</v>

729
00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:28.850
<v Speaker 1>He's a felon at one 75 and I'm two 25.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a tank.</v>

730
00:32:29.820 --> 00:32:32.900
<v Speaker 1>He's a madman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I've met a lot of people that have</v>

731
00:32:32.901 --> 00:32:35.690
<v Speaker 1>a lot of drive but he has a very unusual</v>
<v Speaker 1>drive.</v>

732
00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:36.890
<v Speaker 1>It's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's real weird.</v>

733
00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:40.310
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever done the math on I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes</v>

734
00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:44.270
<v Speaker 4>you shoot most of the time you shoot a</v>
<v Speaker 4>hundred arrows but I know there's been</v>

735
00:32:44.271 --> 00:32:48.560
<v Speaker 4>times where you and I have shot where</v>
<v Speaker 4>you've shot where I know I've shot over</v>

736
00:32:48.561 --> 00:32:52.670
<v Speaker 4>a hundred arrows and you've shot double</v>
<v Speaker 4>that because normally when I'm about</v>

737
00:32:52.671 --> 00:32:55.190
<v Speaker 4>saying I have feel like I had a good</v>
<v Speaker 4>practice.</v>

738
00:32:55.191 --> 00:32:58.100
<v Speaker 4>You're like yeah man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel really warmed up right now.</v>

739
00:32:58.650 --> 00:33:01.870
<v Speaker 4>You know where that comes from.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It comes from playing pool when I and</v>

740
00:33:02.020 --> 00:33:03.100
<v Speaker 4>when you play pool,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is,</v>

741
00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:07.900
<v Speaker 4>this is real high level competitive pool</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I was never high level but um,</v>

742
00:33:08.210 --> 00:33:12.410
<v Speaker 4>when I got to be as good as I got,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was always a what you would call a b</v>

743
00:33:12.411 --> 00:33:15.350
<v Speaker 4>player.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It takes a lot to become a b player.</v>

744
00:33:15.470 --> 00:33:17.330
<v Speaker 4>But I was always a b player and there's</v>
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>

745
00:33:17.660 --> 00:33:21.080
<v Speaker 4>is an a player,</v>
<v Speaker 4>an a player like borders pro and then</v>

746
00:33:21.081 --> 00:33:22.800
<v Speaker 4>there's pro,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is like stratospheric,</v>

747
00:33:22.810 --> 00:33:27.810
<v Speaker 4>like you know Earl stricklin effort and</v>
<v Speaker 4>ray is best of the best top of the food</v>

748
00:33:28.101 --> 00:33:28.400
<v Speaker 4>chain.</v>

749
00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:32.810
<v Speaker 4>This is different level,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but when you play pool,</v>

750
00:33:33.020 --> 00:33:36.560
<v Speaker 4>as you get better and better,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the things that,</v>

751
00:33:36.580 --> 00:33:37.700
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that you get,</v>

752
00:33:37.701 --> 00:33:41.630
<v Speaker 4>you develop like this feel and the feel</v>
<v Speaker 4>really kicks in with me about eight</v>

753
00:33:41.631 --> 00:33:42.980
<v Speaker 4>hours in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I would,</v>

754
00:33:43.010 --> 00:33:45.140
<v Speaker 4>I would be practicing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not joking,</v>

755
00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:49.010
<v Speaker 4>eight hours and I had a full on</v>
<v Speaker 4>sickness.</v>

756
00:33:49.110 --> 00:33:51.320
<v Speaker 4>Go ahead and pull that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know you're trying to do it off the</v>

757
00:33:51.321 --> 00:33:54.150
<v Speaker 4>mic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How addictive of these goddamn on it.</v>

758
00:33:54.151 --> 00:33:55.970
<v Speaker 4>Protein bites.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Holy Shit.</v>

759
00:33:56.690 --> 00:34:01.690
<v Speaker 4>I want stock in these right there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's on these fricking to say good.</v>

760
00:34:02.901 --> 00:34:05.570
<v Speaker 4>I hate for those this morning.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I told myself I was willing to eat</v>

761
00:34:05.571 --> 00:34:07.340
<v Speaker 4>one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was just doing some shit around the</v>

762
00:34:07.341 --> 00:34:12.341
<v Speaker 4>house before I made breakfast and my</v>
<v Speaker 4>fasted a window was up and so I was</v>

763
00:34:12.441 --> 00:34:13.251
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can eat now.</v>

764
00:34:13.251 --> 00:34:14.330
<v Speaker 4>It's like I just have one of these</v>
<v Speaker 4>things.</v>

765
00:34:14.331 --> 00:34:15.830
<v Speaker 4>I ate one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like I'm definitely having to,</v>

766
00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:18.680
<v Speaker 4>and then I ate too cause there's two in</v>
<v Speaker 4>a package and I said fuck that.</v>

767
00:34:18.681 --> 00:34:20.900
<v Speaker 4>I'm hoping in another package I ate four</v>
<v Speaker 4>of them.</v>

768
00:34:21.050 --> 00:34:22.400
<v Speaker 4>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is it,</v>

769
00:34:22.401 --> 00:34:25.010
<v Speaker 4>seven grams each.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's 28 grams of protein.</v>

770
00:34:25.011 --> 00:34:28.880
<v Speaker 4>I ate inside of five minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These are so good.</v>

771
00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:34.120
<v Speaker 4>Prepare from I the other day I said for</v>
<v Speaker 4>anyone out there don't do it.</v>

772
00:34:35.980 --> 00:34:37.910
<v Speaker 4>Cause if you do it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever these,</v>

773
00:34:38.570 --> 00:34:41.690
<v Speaker 4>whatever these are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to go from like this,</v>

774
00:34:41.860 --> 00:34:44.680
<v Speaker 2>the new on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are the protein bites,</v>

775
00:34:44.780 --> 00:34:47.860
<v Speaker 2>coconut cashew and dark chocolate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually the good fight you,</v>

776
00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:52.920
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Andy Stumpf had these first and he gave</v>

777
00:34:54.551 --> 00:34:56.500
<v Speaker 2>me these out of his backpack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where were we?</v>

778
00:34:56.560 --> 00:35:01.560
<v Speaker 2>Oh in Oklahoma we had done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we had done quite a bit of a ride on the</v>

779
00:35:01.931 --> 00:35:06.340
<v Speaker 2>bikes for the day and I'm like I am</v>
<v Speaker 2>starving to death right now.</v>

780
00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:10.960
<v Speaker 2>And he pulled these out of his backpack</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I just said to tell how many of</v>

781
00:35:10.961 --> 00:35:13.000
<v Speaker 2>those did you bring?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>

782
00:35:13.001 --> 00:35:14.080
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

783
00:35:14.110 --> 00:35:17.350
<v Speaker 2>those are going to be gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are dynamite.</v>

784
00:35:17.650 --> 00:35:20.470
<v Speaker 2>My problem is in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm always,</v>

785
00:35:20.560 --> 00:35:24.160
<v Speaker 2>I do like too fast in the morning before</v>
<v Speaker 2>my workouts.</v>

786
00:35:24.790 --> 00:35:26.530
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the window you give yourself?</v>

787
00:35:27.100 --> 00:35:30.130
<v Speaker 2>I normally don't eat until about 10 30</v>
<v Speaker 2>or 11 in the morning.</v>

788
00:35:30.150 --> 00:35:32.380
<v Speaker 2>And what time do you eat at night before</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go to bed?</v>

789
00:35:32.650 --> 00:35:33.640
<v Speaker 2>Seven.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

790
00:35:33.641 --> 00:35:34.750
<v Speaker 2>that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a good window.</v>

791
00:35:34.780 --> 00:35:36.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And honestly,</v>

792
00:35:36.670 --> 00:35:38.280
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like</v>

793
00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:40.320
<v Speaker 4>starving,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm not ready to cook yet.</v>

794
00:35:40.530 --> 00:35:43.290
<v Speaker 4>Or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>normally for my breakfast I'll normally</v>

795
00:35:43.350 --> 00:35:47.700
<v Speaker 4>half an avocado to a full avocado with</v>
<v Speaker 4>anywhere from like four to six eggs.</v>

796
00:35:47.940 --> 00:35:50.700
<v Speaker 4>And if I have any,</v>
<v Speaker 4>any meat leftover from the night before,</v>

797
00:35:50.701 --> 00:35:55.140
<v Speaker 4>I'll slice that and have it with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but these things on the way to the gym,</v>

798
00:35:55.141 --> 00:35:58.230
<v Speaker 4>if I just feel like I don't have</v>
<v Speaker 4>anything in the tank,</v>

799
00:35:58.590 --> 00:36:01.890
<v Speaker 4>these had been awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're very low glycemic index,</v>

800
00:36:01.891 --> 00:36:04.800
<v Speaker 4>low sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and even the protein's not ridiculous.</v>

801
00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:08.730
<v Speaker 4>And when it's seven grams,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that per byte or is that for the</v>

802
00:36:08.731 --> 00:36:12.900
<v Speaker 4>whole bar?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Read that shit according to most</v>

<v Speaker 4>1.7 servings per container too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

807
00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:25.920
<v Speaker 4>This is supposed to be one bite.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well it's the bite is like the name for</v>

808
00:36:25.921 --> 00:36:26.940
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not supposed to be like,</v>

809
00:36:26.970 --> 00:36:28.470
<v Speaker 4>how are you going to fit that whole</v>
<v Speaker 4>thing in your mouth?</v>

810
00:36:29.790 --> 00:36:32.490
<v Speaker 4>To me that's a bite.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well it's they're called protein bites.</v>

811
00:36:32.550 --> 00:36:35.370
<v Speaker 4>Why wouldn't it be one square?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cause you already bid out of it like</v>

812
00:36:35.371 --> 00:36:36.210
<v Speaker 4>you've been out of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Again,</v>

813
00:36:36.211 --> 00:36:37.770
<v Speaker 4>that's two bites.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's ridiculous.</v>

814
00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:40.980
<v Speaker 4>It can't be one bite.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean you could do it if you had to.</v>

815
00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:43.230
<v Speaker 4>If I wasn't on a podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would have done that.</v>

816
00:36:43.231 --> 00:36:45.780
<v Speaker 4>Like nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People get real mad by the way.</v>

817
00:36:45.781 --> 00:36:47.550
<v Speaker 4>They're gonna get mad at you for chewing</v>
<v Speaker 4>on the Mike.</v>

818
00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:52.350
<v Speaker 4>Can't be more annoying than Mel Gibson's</v>
<v Speaker 4>fricking pin almost shot myself in the</v>

819
00:36:52.351 --> 00:36:56.490
<v Speaker 4>face for that fricking thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't say anything to him.</v>

820
00:36:56.700 --> 00:37:00.060
<v Speaker 4>He's sitting over here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>

821
00:37:00.140 --> 00:37:01.710
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I want a nice guy,</v>

822
00:37:01.711 --> 00:37:02.970
<v Speaker 4>he's a nice guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was,</v>

823
00:37:02.971 --> 00:37:06.750
<v Speaker 4>but he's fried.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a circuit that that just hit an</v>

824
00:37:06.751 --> 00:37:10.440
<v Speaker 4>overload and there's a black area where</v>
<v Speaker 4>it used to be connected to the</v>

825
00:37:10.441 --> 00:37:12.360
<v Speaker 4>motherboard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

826
00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:14.640
<v Speaker 4>Well you know more than me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nice guy.</v>

827

<v Speaker 4>Brad's.</v>

830
00:37:19.351 --> 00:37:23.010
<v Speaker 4>He does all this on your podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was great podcast by the way.</v>

831
00:37:23.460 --> 00:37:26.430
<v Speaker 4>He made that yesterday,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is kind of hilarious.</v>

832
00:37:26.790 --> 00:37:30.690
<v Speaker 4>John Dudley death dark your face over</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mel Gibson.</v>

833
00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:32.310
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's hilarious.</v>

834
00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:33.330
<v Speaker 4>It,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

835
00:37:33.331 --> 00:37:36.330
<v Speaker 4>it was funny.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you have whatever that Penn was my</v>

836
00:37:36.331 --> 00:37:38.010
<v Speaker 4>God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was terrible.</v>

837
00:37:38.490 --> 00:37:39.960
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well you know what it was,</v>

838
00:37:39.990 --> 00:37:42.030
<v Speaker 4>I just don't think he could just sit and</v>
<v Speaker 4>chill.</v>

839
00:37:42.180 --> 00:37:45.330
<v Speaker 4>And when Dr Neil Riordan was discussing</v>
<v Speaker 4>all this real hard,</v>

840
00:37:45.570 --> 00:37:49.920
<v Speaker 4>heavy duty scientific stuff when in</v>
<v Speaker 4>regards to stem cell research and all</v>

841
00:37:49.921 --> 00:37:51.420
<v Speaker 4>the different,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean he's had,</v>

842
00:37:51.510 --> 00:37:53.070
<v Speaker 4>I mean one of the reasons why he came</v>
<v Speaker 4>on,</v>

843
00:37:53.071 --> 00:37:55.590
<v Speaker 4>he wanted to come on the podcast and</v>
<v Speaker 4>people were like,</v>

844
00:37:55.591 --> 00:37:57.270
<v Speaker 4>why didn't you ask him about his wife?</v>

845
00:37:57.630 --> 00:38:00.090
<v Speaker 4>Why did you ask him about the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's not what he's here for.</v>

846
00:38:00.610 --> 00:38:03.780
<v Speaker 4>I want to be respectful to the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a fan of Mel Gibson and he's a nice</v>

847
00:38:03.781 --> 00:38:05.730
<v Speaker 4>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What he asked is he said,</v>

848
00:38:05.731 --> 00:38:10.020
<v Speaker 4>can I come on the podcast and talk about</v>
<v Speaker 4>the stem cell research they're doing in</v>

849
00:38:10.021 --> 00:38:14.580
<v Speaker 4>Panama and the treatments that they gave</v>
<v Speaker 4>to my dad at 92 years of age.</v>

850
00:38:14.581 --> 00:38:15.990
<v Speaker 4>Now he's thriving.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It almost,</v>

851
00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:18.480
<v Speaker 4>it was a great podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

852
00:38:18.481 --> 00:38:19.314
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

853
00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:24.800
<v Speaker 4>I'm a believer in stem cell because you</v>
<v Speaker 4>actually introduced me to doctor Rati</v>

854
00:38:25.080 --> 00:38:27.130
<v Speaker 4>Mcgee in Las Vegas.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Saved,</v>

855
00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:29.970
<v Speaker 4>I mean potentially you saved my archery</v>
<v Speaker 4>career.</v>

856
00:38:30.420 --> 00:38:34.000
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cause we get from surgery if I will.</v>

857
00:38:34.180 --> 00:38:36.100
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And surgeries</v>

858
00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:37.400
<v Speaker 2>are fricking hit or miss.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

859
00:38:37.401 --> 00:38:39.190
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's what I'm saying.</v>

860
00:38:39.790 --> 00:38:43.180
<v Speaker 2>I was lucky with my shoulder surgery</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I got out of there.</v>

861
00:38:43.181 --> 00:38:45.010
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know a lot of guys that are into their</v>

862
00:38:45.011 --> 00:38:49.600
<v Speaker 2>third one for the same type of thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but literally I got</v>

863
00:38:50.530 --> 00:38:51.020
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>

864
00:38:51.020 --> 00:38:56.020
<v Speaker 2>three injections the first time and went</v>
<v Speaker 2>back for a second round because I think</v>

865
00:38:56.151 --> 00:39:01.151
<v Speaker 2>one of my tears didn't take.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And literally I took completely avoided</v>

866
00:39:02.121 --> 00:39:03.910
<v Speaker 2>surgery because of doctrine mcgee.</v>

867
00:39:03.980 --> 00:39:07.640
<v Speaker 1>And we should talk about this because I</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know the exact specifics of what</v>

868
00:39:07.641 --> 00:39:09.950
<v Speaker 1>it was called,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the original treatment was called,</v>

869
00:39:09.951 --> 00:39:11.810
<v Speaker 1>but the original treatment that you and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I both got,</v>

870
00:39:11.811 --> 00:39:13.470
<v Speaker 1>he no longer baby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Definitely quick,</v>

871
00:39:13.720 --> 00:39:17.600
<v Speaker 1>quick got a baby does this past weekend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not available anymore.</v>

872
00:39:17.780 --> 00:39:21.470
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's because they believe this is what</v>

873
00:39:21.530 --> 00:39:25.310
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to make it legal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it has to go through a series of,</v>

874
00:39:25.390 --> 00:39:28.510
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a whole process that it has to</v>

875
00:39:28.590 --> 00:39:31.730
<v Speaker 1>get it passed because they've declared</v>
<v Speaker 1>it a drug.</v>

876
00:39:32.120 --> 00:39:35.600
<v Speaker 1>Because you take the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is something about umbilical cord stem</v>

877
00:39:35.601 --> 00:39:38.510
<v Speaker 1>cells.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You take them and convert them and then</v>

878
00:39:38.511 --> 00:39:41.810
<v Speaker 1>that somehow or another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the in during the process they believe</v>

879
00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:43.970
<v Speaker 1>it's become a drug.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever that drug is.</v>

880
00:39:44.150 --> 00:39:47.060
<v Speaker 1>I had a full length tear of my rotator</v>
<v Speaker 1>cuff.</v>

881
00:39:47.061 --> 00:39:50.930
<v Speaker 1>Now this is from an MRI,</v>
<v Speaker 1>full length tear of my rotator cuff.</v>

882
00:39:50.931 --> 00:39:53.090
<v Speaker 1>It was painful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a real problem.</v>

883
00:39:53.660 --> 00:39:56.150
<v Speaker 1>Doctor Rati Mcgee in Las Vegas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nevada,</v>

884
00:39:56.180 --> 00:39:58.250
<v Speaker 1>shot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever that baby dust is in there.</v>

885
00:39:58.470 --> 00:40:00.110
<v Speaker 1>Gave you some end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

886
00:40:00.140 --> 00:40:05.060
<v Speaker 1>the most recent MRI that I got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is over a year from his original</v>

887
00:40:05.061 --> 00:40:07.040
<v Speaker 1>treme.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I knew that it felt a lot better,</v>

888
00:40:07.070 --> 00:40:08.690
<v Speaker 1>but I have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just haven't got it checked.</v>

889
00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:09.670
<v Speaker 1>It's gone.</v>

890
00:40:09.670 --> 00:40:13.030
<v Speaker 2>Funny enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was with you both times right the</v>

891
00:40:13.031 --> 00:40:14.350
<v Speaker 2>first time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>

892
00:40:14.620 --> 00:40:16.150
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't say anything about,</v>

893
00:40:16.151 --> 00:40:19.720
<v Speaker 2>but you had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you had been struggling to shoot a lot</v>

894
00:40:19.870 --> 00:40:22.060
<v Speaker 2>because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you had just,</v>

895
00:40:22.300 --> 00:40:23.680
<v Speaker 2>it's wearing tear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

896
00:40:23.681 --> 00:40:26.050
<v Speaker 2>the bottom line is it's wear and tear</v>
<v Speaker 2>over life,</v>

897
00:40:26.080 --> 00:40:29.050
<v Speaker 2>especially with you and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we do a lot of active stuff.</v>

898
00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:34.020
<v Speaker 2>But for you to go back and you and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>went in together,</v>

899
00:40:34.390 --> 00:40:38.760
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>last week and when he said he looked at</v>

900
00:40:38.761 --> 00:40:40.470
<v Speaker 2>you with this confused face and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

901
00:40:40.471 --> 00:40:44.040
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a new MRI that is healed,</v>

902
00:40:44.490 --> 00:40:45.710
<v Speaker 2>that's fricking massive.</v>

903
00:40:45.730 --> 00:40:48.250
<v Speaker 1>It's massive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a tear that would have normally</v>

904
00:40:48.251 --> 00:40:52.720
<v Speaker 1>absolutely required surgery or I could</v>
<v Speaker 1>have just been in pain with an unstable</v>

905
00:40:52.721 --> 00:40:54.100
<v Speaker 1>shoulder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

906
00:40:54.270 --> 00:40:58.420
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that I'm realizing is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that over the years of uh,</v>

907
00:40:58.660 --> 00:41:01.150
<v Speaker 1>essentially being engulfed in martial</v>
<v Speaker 1>arts,</v>

908
00:41:01.151 --> 00:41:04.570
<v Speaker 1>most of my adult life and even into my</v>
<v Speaker 1>teenage years,</v>

909
00:41:04.571 --> 00:41:07.090
<v Speaker 1>like at 15,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I became a fanatic.</v>

910
00:41:07.150 --> 00:41:09.250
<v Speaker 1>Like from then on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>martial arts has always been a part of</v>

911
00:41:09.251 --> 00:41:12.670
<v Speaker 1>my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've done some ruthless shit with my</v>

912
00:41:12.671 --> 00:41:15.040
<v Speaker 1>joints.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Both of my knees had been reconstructed.</v>

913
00:41:15.250 --> 00:41:17.440
<v Speaker 1>I've had some real problems with my neck</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the past,</v>

914
00:41:17.441 --> 00:41:19.750
<v Speaker 1>both of my shoulders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>f of cause of problems.</v>

915
00:41:19.751 --> 00:41:23.530
<v Speaker 1>It's just explosive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy shit.</v>

916
00:41:23.531 --> 00:41:25.910
<v Speaker 1>Your arms are getting yanked in weird</v>
<v Speaker 1>directions,</v>

917
00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:28.120
<v Speaker 1>your foot windmill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that stuff.</v>

918
00:41:28.121 --> 00:41:32.830
<v Speaker 1>That's the easiest stuff that's probably</v>
<v Speaker 1>saved me all that big foot I really</v>

919
00:41:32.831 --> 00:41:36.350
<v Speaker 1>think saved me because that's shoulders</v>
<v Speaker 1>to ability because that's controlled,</v>

920
00:41:36.590 --> 00:41:38.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all that stuff that I'm doing that's all</v>

921
00:41:38.421 --> 00:41:42.050
<v Speaker 1>strengthening all these muscles around</v>
<v Speaker 1>it and that doesn't bother me.</v>

922
00:41:42.070 --> 00:41:45.650
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't give me any pain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would give me pain is like off</v>

923
00:41:45.651 --> 00:41:48.530
<v Speaker 1>angle punches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you land on someone's elbow in a</v>

924
00:41:48.531 --> 00:41:50.770
<v Speaker 1>weird way and you feel something</v>

925
00:41:50.900 --> 00:41:52.830
<v Speaker 2>go for it right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even thinking about it.</v>

926
00:41:52.831 --> 00:41:53.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

927
00:41:53.560 --> 00:41:56.380
<v Speaker 1>Getting caught in something like Kamora</v>
<v Speaker 1>and not tapping.</v>

928
00:41:56.590 --> 00:41:59.230
<v Speaker 1>I've done that a bunch of times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like a shithead.</v>

929
00:42:00.130 --> 00:42:01.770
<v Speaker 1>You're a meathead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know you,</v>

930
00:42:01.820 --> 00:42:04.570
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to tap but you gotta tap</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't want you to like,</v>

931
00:42:04.571 --> 00:42:07.150
<v Speaker 1>there's gotta be a way to get out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>this without tapping and then you get</v>

932
00:42:07.151 --> 00:42:08.950
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then you can't do chin ups for like</v>

933
00:42:08.951 --> 00:42:13.390
<v Speaker 1>three months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's happened 30 times in my life.</v>

934
00:42:13.420 --> 00:42:15.940
<v Speaker 1>Like no joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like where I didn't tap and then I was</v>

935
00:42:15.941 --> 00:42:19.060
<v Speaker 1>fucked up for a few months and then I</v>
<v Speaker 1>would tape everything up and keep</v>

936
00:42:19.061 --> 00:42:19.870
<v Speaker 1>rolling.</v>

937
00:42:19.870 --> 00:42:21.400
<v Speaker 2>Well you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you hooked me up with,</v>

938
00:42:21.670 --> 00:42:26.670
<v Speaker 2>with Damien in Demoine for 10 planet and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really wanted to do,</v>

939
00:42:27.460 --> 00:42:32.460
<v Speaker 2>she just did classes with them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm so afraid to do it in a class</v>

940
00:42:33.371 --> 00:42:36.310
<v Speaker 2>because for me it's my arms or my</v>
<v Speaker 2>career.</v>

941
00:42:36.340 --> 00:42:37.001
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

942
00:42:37.001 --> 00:42:41.800
<v Speaker 2>And I mean it would literally be like</v>
<v Speaker 2>turning a light switch off in your room.</v>

943
00:42:41.990 --> 00:42:44.420
<v Speaker 1>My friend Max [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a professional pool player and he</v>

944
00:42:44.421 --> 00:42:47.540
<v Speaker 1>said the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was really interested in trying</v>

945
00:42:47.570 --> 00:42:50.330
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So scared of getting his arm bar,</v>

946
00:42:50.750 --> 00:42:54.560
<v Speaker 1>getting locked in an arm bar and fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>his elbow or shoulder up and then he</v>

947
00:42:54.561 --> 00:42:57.500
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't be able to play.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it's a real legitimate concern.</v>

948
00:42:58.120 --> 00:43:00.220
<v Speaker 2>Two days ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know if I told you this,</v>

949
00:43:00.250 --> 00:43:04.660
<v Speaker 2>but I'm andy texts me and she stumped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

950
00:43:04.661 --> 00:43:09.661
<v Speaker 2>He put me in a group text and needed a</v>
<v Speaker 2>closer and Jocko reached out.</v>

951
00:43:11.681 --> 00:43:15.700
<v Speaker 2>We were in a group text and Jocko wants</v>
<v Speaker 2>a boat and wants lessons he wants.</v>

952
00:43:15.701 --> 00:43:19.990
<v Speaker 2>So does of course he does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's kind of a fucking knife in his</v>

953
00:43:19.991 --> 00:43:20.561
<v Speaker 2>teeth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

954
00:43:20.561 --> 00:43:21.850
<v Speaker 2>Full draw.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

955
00:43:21.851 --> 00:43:25.720
<v Speaker 2>And he's like just make something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he won't break in half cause he's like</v>

956
00:43:25.721 --> 00:43:27.300
<v Speaker 2>he will break it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

957
00:43:27.640 --> 00:43:30.230
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought Ah Shit,</v>

958
00:43:30.250 --> 00:43:34.180
<v Speaker 2>if I've got to have jack over,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know we're going to end up working out</v>

959
00:43:34.181 --> 00:43:35.920
<v Speaker 2>cause if he's at my house more than two</v>
<v Speaker 2>days,</v>

960
00:43:35.921 --> 00:43:37.900
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to skip two days of</v>
<v Speaker 2>working out.</v>

961
00:43:38.200 --> 00:43:41.710
<v Speaker 2>So I thought I better hit the fricking</v>
<v Speaker 2>squat rack cause I'm more of a bike guy.</v>

962
00:43:41.711 --> 00:43:44.650
<v Speaker 2>Like all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most of my leg workouts come from,</v>

963
00:43:45.430 --> 00:43:47.890
<v Speaker 2>well they come from kettle bells or they</v>
<v Speaker 2>come from,</v>

964
00:43:47.950 --> 00:43:52.950
<v Speaker 2>from biking because I liked the bat bike</v>
<v Speaker 2>or ruck when I thought we'll explain</v>

965
00:43:53.111 --> 00:43:56.260

<v Speaker 1>western hunting.</v>

1002
00:45:39.930 --> 00:45:44.760
<v Speaker 1>And see when I think most people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know what hunting is or did it not</v>

1003
00:45:44.761 --> 00:45:47.550
<v Speaker 1>in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which to me prior to 2012 they think of</v>

1004
00:45:47.551 --> 00:45:52.200
<v Speaker 1>hunting is fucking elmer fudd some dude</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a orange vest on shooting some</v>

1005

<v Speaker 1>innocent animal.</v>

1006
00:45:54.120 --> 00:45:57.210
<v Speaker 1>What western hunting is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is where it gets really weird.</v>

1007
00:45:58.110 --> 00:46:03.110
<v Speaker 1>It's fitness with mental strength,</v>
<v Speaker 1>discipline and then hunting.</v>

1008
00:46:04.350 --> 00:46:07.560
<v Speaker 1>There's so much involved in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're dealing with mountains,</v>

1009
00:46:07.561 --> 00:46:09.750
<v Speaker 1>so you have mountaineering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hiking.</v>

1010
00:46:10.080 --> 00:46:14.270
<v Speaker 1>It's a tough mudder with a weapon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is and that's what it is.</v>

1011
00:46:14.710 --> 00:46:16.320

1152
00:52:52.430 --> 00:52:55.220
<v Speaker 2>then those particular areas build,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1153
00:52:55.221 --> 00:52:59.210
<v Speaker 2>it's just like I would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of times he tells me that my,</v>

1154
00:52:59.660 --> 00:53:04.250
<v Speaker 2>my bicep and my forearm connector on my</v>
<v Speaker 2>right side are a lot like what a</v>

1155
00:53:04.251 --> 00:53:06.890
<v Speaker 2>fighters are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a right hand prominent where</v>

1156
00:53:06.891 --> 00:53:11.891
<v Speaker 2>they're having impact in the same with</v>
<v Speaker 2>my left because as you're shooting,</v>

1157
00:53:12.141 --> 00:53:17.141
<v Speaker 2>it's just constant hyperextension so you</v>
<v Speaker 2>build that scarring in there and when</v>

1158
00:53:17.571 --> 00:53:19.400
<v Speaker 2>the scarring isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1159
00:53:19.430 --> 00:53:22.310
<v Speaker 2>it's restricting the muscle from moving</v>
<v Speaker 2>properly.</v>

1160
00:53:22.460 --> 00:53:24.770
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he talks to me like he said,</v>

1161
00:53:24.771 --> 00:53:25.441
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1162
00:53:25.441 --> 00:53:26.220
<v Speaker 2>if you have long</v>

1163
00:53:26.220 --> 00:53:28.560
<v Speaker 4>hair and you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you get out of the shower,</v>

1164
00:53:28.561 --> 00:53:31.410
<v Speaker 4>it's not all the fibers aren't going the</v>
<v Speaker 4>same direction.</v>

1165
00:53:31.710 --> 00:53:35.010
<v Speaker 4>You have to like get all the knots and</v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff out of there.</v>

1166
00:53:35.370 --> 00:53:39.480
<v Speaker 4>So essentially he's trying to break up</v>
<v Speaker 4>those areas where the muscles aren't</v>

1167
00:53:39.600 --> 00:53:42.180
<v Speaker 4>flowing back and forth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1168
00:53:42.210 --> 00:53:45.450
<v Speaker 4>smoothly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So even though I don't have necessarily</v>

1169
00:53:45.451 --> 00:53:47.430
<v Speaker 4>a tear,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel soreness at times.</v>

1170
00:53:47.850 --> 00:53:51.030
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would say maybe even a chronic</v>

1171
00:53:51.031 --> 00:53:53.040
<v Speaker 4>soreness,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if I go and actually have that</v>

1172
00:53:53.041 --> 00:53:54.930
<v Speaker 4>broken apart,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1173
00:53:54.931 --> 00:53:59.931
<v Speaker 4>it's extremely painful to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But my performance afterwards is just</v>

1174
00:54:00.690 --> 00:54:03.420
<v Speaker 4>night and day different.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think you should do it a lot.</v>

1175
00:54:03.630 --> 00:54:04.650
<v Speaker 4>I really do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I,</v>

1176
00:54:04.770 --> 00:54:05.610
<v Speaker 4>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

1177
00:54:05.670 --> 00:54:07.650
<v Speaker 4>it's hard to find that good person</v>
<v Speaker 4>though.</v>

1178
00:54:07.660 --> 00:54:10.200
<v Speaker 4>That's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why it goes so far,</v>

1179
00:54:10.230 --> 00:54:12.060
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is to find someone that really,</v>

1180
00:54:12.061 --> 00:54:15.060
<v Speaker 4>really knows what they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you have a time massage place in your</v>

1181
00:54:15.061 --> 00:54:16.950
<v Speaker 4>town?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

1182
00:54:16.980 --> 00:54:18.810
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1183
00:54:19.410 --> 00:54:20.490
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no ties.</v>

1184
00:54:20.491 --> 00:54:22.170
<v Speaker 4>Make it up to Iowa.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1185
00:54:22.380 --> 00:54:24.060
<v Speaker 4>This is some kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm around here man.</v>

1186
00:54:24.061 --> 00:54:25.500
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not,</v>

1187
00:54:25.530 --> 00:54:27.240
<v Speaker 4>not very expensive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but amazing.</v>

1188
00:54:27.241 --> 00:54:29.160
<v Speaker 4>Like I had this lady that walks on my</v>
<v Speaker 4>back,</v>

1189
00:54:29.500 --> 00:54:32.510
<v Speaker 4>she's probably about 60 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She walks about on my back,</v>

1190
00:54:32.540 --> 00:54:35.850
<v Speaker 4>grabs my wrists and pulls them up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pop that back.</v>

1191
00:54:38.720 --> 00:54:40.950
<v Speaker 4>But she's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she's stretches you out,</v>

1192
00:54:40.951 --> 00:54:42.900
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like part of the thing,</v>

1193
00:54:43.180 --> 00:54:44.910
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is a massage.</v>

1194
00:54:44.911 --> 00:54:47.550
<v Speaker 4>And then once she gets in that tissue</v>
<v Speaker 4>and loosens it up,</v>

1195
00:54:47.551 --> 00:54:49.980
<v Speaker 4>then she starts pulling on your arms and</v>
<v Speaker 4>stretching you out.</v>

1196
00:54:50.490 --> 00:54:53.100
<v Speaker 4>Time massage is legit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's really good holders.</v>

1197
00:54:53.101 --> 00:54:54.950
<v Speaker 4>Jack.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now my best helps it.</v>

1198
00:54:55.110 --> 00:54:57.350
<v Speaker 4>I'm lady trying to rip your arms out of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the socket.</v>

1199
00:54:57.360 --> 00:55:01.470
<v Speaker 4>I'd be fucked without her.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It'd be fucked with a lot of different</v>

1200
00:55:01.471 --> 00:55:02.700
<v Speaker 4>things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that's one of them.</v>

1201
00:55:02.830 --> 00:55:03.660
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1202
00:55:03.660 --> 00:55:04.800
<v Speaker 4>but this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1203
00:55:05.040 --> 00:55:07.710
<v Speaker 4>stem cell research that they're involved</v>
<v Speaker 4>in right now,</v>

1204
00:55:07.800 --> 00:55:11.190
<v Speaker 4>they're what they're doing right now in</v>
<v Speaker 4>Panama because it's not legal in the</v>

1205
00:55:11.191 --> 00:55:13.410
<v Speaker 4>United States.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was a good podcast.</v>

1206
00:55:13.620 --> 00:55:14.520
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was amazing.</v>

1207
00:55:14.521 --> 00:55:15.210
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The Guy,</v>

1208
00:55:15.210 --> 00:55:17.010
<v Speaker 4>Dr Neil reared,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's very good.</v>

1209
00:55:17.040 --> 00:55:20.070
<v Speaker 4>He's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They just passed a significant hurdle in</v>

1210
00:55:20.071 --> 00:55:21.210
<v Speaker 4>Texas.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>

1211
00:55:21.240 --> 00:55:23.760
<v Speaker 4>So they're real close to being able to</v>
<v Speaker 4>do that in Texas.</v>

1212
00:55:23.760 --> 00:55:28.760
<v Speaker 4>And it might happen as soon as the fall.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So somewhere around,</v>

1213
00:55:28.880 --> 00:55:30.180
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>archery season,</v>

1215
00:55:33.751 --> 00:55:35.850
<v Speaker 4>get all the same stuff that we're going</v>
<v Speaker 4>to get in Panama.</v>

1216
00:55:35.851 --> 00:55:37.520
<v Speaker 4>What you should do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

1217
00:55:37.590 --> 00:55:40.640
<v Speaker 4>if anybody listens to that podcast or</v>
<v Speaker 4>anybody's talking to talk,</v>

1218
00:55:40.660 --> 00:55:45.120
<v Speaker 4>talk to someone like me who has</v>
<v Speaker 4>benefited tremendously from it and I</v>

1219
00:55:45.121 --> 00:55:47.340
<v Speaker 4>haven't even gone and done what he's</v>
<v Speaker 4>doing,</v>

1220
00:55:47.341 --> 00:55:51.510
<v Speaker 4>which is complete next level in Panama,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I know Tj dillashaw,</v>

1221
00:55:51.511 --> 00:55:54.090
<v Speaker 4>UFC bantamweight champion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's gone there twice now.</v>

1222
00:55:54.600 --> 00:55:57.240
<v Speaker 4>Fucking had massive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>massive recovery from it.</v>

1223
00:55:57.270 --> 00:55:58.480
<v Speaker 4>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're,</v>

1224
00:55:58.540 --> 00:56:03.540
<v Speaker 4>we're in an incredible time when it</v>
<v Speaker 4>comes to medical science and technology</v>

1225
00:56:05.311 --> 00:56:08.340
<v Speaker 4>and innovation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like what they're able to do and fix and</v>

1226
00:56:08.341 --> 00:56:09.900
<v Speaker 4>heal people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1227
00:56:09.901 --> 00:56:13.050
<v Speaker 4>that have had really significant</v>
<v Speaker 4>injuries.</v>

1228
00:56:13.051 --> 00:56:15.000
<v Speaker 4>That would have been a giant problem</v>
<v Speaker 4>before.</v>

1229
00:56:15.170 --> 00:56:16.760
<v Speaker 4>I have a friend of mine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she works at the UFC.</v>

1230
00:56:16.780 --> 00:56:20.670
<v Speaker 4>My friend Heather,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she had a achilles tendon injury from</v>

1231
00:56:20.671 --> 00:56:21.690
<v Speaker 4>Rati.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

1232
00:56:21.720 --> 00:56:23.100
<v Speaker 4>He did the surgery.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

1233
00:56:23.440 --> 00:56:24.190
<v Speaker 4>and she's</v>

1234
00:56:24.190 --> 00:56:27.340
<v Speaker 1>six weeks later walking around without a</v>
<v Speaker 1>limp dude.</v>

1235
00:56:27.490 --> 00:56:30.910
<v Speaker 1>She told me that sick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would be six months where she would</v>

1236
00:56:30.911 --> 00:56:35.500
<v Speaker 1>be in a cast if it wasn't for a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this new stuff that's crazy.</v>

1237
00:56:35.560 --> 00:56:36.670
<v Speaker 1>She's walking around without a limp.</v>

1238
00:56:36.980 --> 00:56:39.770
<v Speaker 2>I remember when you were in there and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>was uh,</v>

1239
00:56:39.830 --> 00:56:43.370
<v Speaker 2>Rodney came in and he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had told you about the MRI and said</v>

1240
00:56:44.780 --> 00:56:48.710
<v Speaker 2>it really looks like everything has</v>
<v Speaker 2>grown back together.</v>

1241
00:56:49.320 --> 00:56:53.870
<v Speaker 2>It's healed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just said that's some tron shit right</v>

1242
00:56:53.871 --> 00:56:54.580
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>

1243
00:56:54.580 --> 00:56:58.490
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's like to be able to reconstruct</v>

1244
00:56:58.491 --> 00:57:01.970
<v Speaker 2>something without having to go under the</v>
<v Speaker 2>knife for someone.</v>

1245
00:57:02.030 --> 00:57:04.820
<v Speaker 2>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went under the knife with my shoulder</v>

1246
00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:08.540
<v Speaker 2>and I know that the difference in</v>
<v Speaker 2>recovery between</v>

1247
00:57:10.130 --> 00:57:14.720
<v Speaker 2>literally not being able to almost</v>
<v Speaker 2>function a part of your body entirely</v>

1248
00:57:14.810 --> 00:57:19.810
<v Speaker 2>versus them saying take it easy and work</v>
<v Speaker 2>your way back into what you want to do.</v>

1249
00:57:22.260 --> 00:57:25.370
<v Speaker 2>Those are two pair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they're like completely different</v>

1250
00:57:25.371 --> 00:57:26.204
<v Speaker 2>universes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1251
00:57:26.210 --> 00:57:28.820
<v Speaker 2>Being in a situation where you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1252
00:57:28.850 --> 00:57:31.250
<v Speaker 2>one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to take painkillers,</v>

1253
00:57:31.310 --> 00:57:35.960
<v Speaker 2>which that's not cool to having to have</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone that you're dependent on,</v>

1254
00:57:36.200 --> 00:57:38.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pack pillows under your arm and keep you</v>

1255
00:57:38.541 --> 00:57:42.490
<v Speaker 2>steady for three days in bed and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>can't freaking move around.</v>

1256
00:57:42.530 --> 00:57:43.790
<v Speaker 2>Then you got this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1257
00:57:43.791 --> 00:57:48.791
<v Speaker 2>big wedge under your arm and you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>walking around versus we literally went</v>

1258
00:57:49.221 --> 00:57:51.200
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>went through the process,</v>

1259
00:57:51.650 --> 00:57:54.890
<v Speaker 2>get an ultrasound,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they find the place to target.</v>

1260
00:57:55.160 --> 00:57:57.620
<v Speaker 2>You see a syringe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>literally go in,</v>

1261
00:57:57.621 --> 00:58:00.230
<v Speaker 2>no different than if you go and get a</v>
<v Speaker 2>tetanus shot,</v>

1262
00:58:00.260 --> 00:58:02.660
<v Speaker 2>you could see it in the ultrasound.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You actually watch it go in,</v>

1263
00:58:02.690 --> 00:58:04.580
<v Speaker 2>it goes in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>comes out,</v>

1264
00:58:04.581 --> 00:58:06.710
<v Speaker 2>and then it's done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You mean,</v>

1265
00:58:06.730 --> 00:58:11.730
<v Speaker 2>and you literally go home and you're in</v>
<v Speaker 2>these things just go to work.</v>

1266
00:58:13.240 --> 00:58:14.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1267
00:58:14.020 --> 00:58:16.000
<v Speaker 1>I'm really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really hopeful for the future.</v>

1268
00:58:16.210 --> 00:58:20.890
<v Speaker 1>And we just went into this past weekend</v>
<v Speaker 1>a rottie looked at the MRI and uh,</v>

1269
00:58:20.950 --> 00:58:24.190
<v Speaker 1>he was stunned at the fact that my</v>
<v Speaker 1>rotator cuffs had been completely</v>

1270
00:58:24.191 --> 00:58:28.630
<v Speaker 1>healed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I still have some little tears in</v>

1271
00:58:28.631 --> 00:58:32.200
<v Speaker 1>the Labor area.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we shot some right into the joint.</v>

1272
00:58:32.680 --> 00:58:34.540
<v Speaker 1>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they're calm,</v>

1273
00:58:34.570 --> 00:58:38.260
<v Speaker 1>they're constantly innovating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now they're using umbilical cord</v>

1274
00:58:38.261 --> 00:58:42.440
<v Speaker 1>blood</v>
<v Speaker 1>and apparently they're having massive</v>

1275
00:58:42.441 --> 00:58:47.240
<v Speaker 1>results with umbilical cord blood and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they're using your blood and the</v>

1276
00:58:47.241 --> 00:58:49.130
<v Speaker 1>PRP.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was cool.</v>

1277
00:58:49.160 --> 00:58:51.260
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy to watch the machine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very cool.</v>

1278
00:58:51.261 --> 00:58:54.950
<v Speaker 1>It mixes it all up and then it and puts</v>
<v Speaker 1>it with the stem cells and it's like</v>

1279
00:58:55.580 --> 00:58:58.700
<v Speaker 1>we're living in the future man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause I almost feel like I got gypped</v>

1280
00:59:00.200 --> 00:59:01.520
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean by that?</v>

1281
00:59:01.600 --> 00:59:02.820
<v Speaker 1>Cause it healed you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1282
00:59:02.930 --> 00:59:07.930
<v Speaker 1>I mean I had a hard time carrying a jug</v>
<v Speaker 1>of milk with my right arm.</v>

1283
00:59:09.140 --> 00:59:12.010
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people found that hard to</v>
<v Speaker 2>believe because,</v>

1284
00:59:12.250 --> 00:59:14.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my arms aren't small,</v>

1285
00:59:14.710 --> 00:59:16.810
<v Speaker 2>I don't think in average.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

1286
00:59:16.811 --> 00:59:18.820
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a tough,</v>

1287
00:59:18.821 --> 00:59:23.810
<v Speaker 2>tough time carrying a jug of milk and a</v>
<v Speaker 2>hammer fist position and then got the</v>

1288
00:59:23.811 --> 00:59:26.280
<v Speaker 2>Mri saw few,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1289
00:59:26.690 --> 00:59:31.690
<v Speaker 2>actually three areas where I just pretty</v>
<v Speaker 2>much abuse it and tore it apart and got</v>

1290
00:59:33.561 --> 00:59:37.610
<v Speaker 2>those three injections the first time</v>
<v Speaker 2>two of them took,</v>

1291
00:59:37.700 --> 00:59:40.970
<v Speaker 2>I ended up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually roddy had me back there for a</v>

1292
00:59:41.030 --> 00:59:46.030
<v Speaker 2>Fox News thing because I sent him a</v>
<v Speaker 2>video of me doing 60 pound curls three,</v>

1293
00:59:48.380 --> 00:59:53.380
<v Speaker 2>three weeks after the first stem cell</v>
<v Speaker 2>injection and I wasn't even able to</v>

1294
00:59:54.050 --> 00:59:57.740
<v Speaker 2>carry a jug of milk and I was doing 60</v>
<v Speaker 2>pound curls for sets,</v>

1295
00:59:57.770 --> 00:59:59.420
<v Speaker 2>no pain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no pain.</v>

1296
00:59:59.870 --> 01:00:04.640
<v Speaker 2>So I went there and did that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well then it ended up slowly coming back</v>

1297
01:00:04.641 --> 01:00:08.180
<v Speaker 2>where I felt pain in one area of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>three.</v>

1298
01:00:08.450 --> 01:00:11.240
<v Speaker 2>So I had a different,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had an injection then,</v>

1299
01:00:11.241 --> 01:00:15.650
<v Speaker 2>but what I had at that time was what we</v>
<v Speaker 2>referred to as a baby dust.</v>

1300
01:00:17.570 --> 01:00:18.860
<v Speaker 2>But now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1301
01:00:19.100 --> 01:00:23.540
<v Speaker 2>you and my wife Sharon had prp,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was really,</v>

1302
01:00:23.541 --> 01:00:27.080
<v Speaker 2>really cool to see that machine work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>PRP mixed with stem cells.</v>

1303
01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:28.520
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

1304
01:00:28.580 --> 01:00:32.210
<v Speaker 2>So it's an actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the very first time I came in,</v>

1305
01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:33.950
<v Speaker 2>they had us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1306
01:00:35.090 --> 01:00:40.090
<v Speaker 2>he asked me to do a light workout after,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then the second time I came back,</v>

1307
01:00:40.371 --> 01:00:42.770
<v Speaker 2>he had me do a workout before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1308
01:00:42.771 --> 01:00:44.660
<v Speaker 2>He did that with me as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

1309
01:00:44.690 --> 01:00:47.270
<v Speaker 2>and then injected it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then we talked about the benefits of</v>

1310
01:00:47.271 --> 01:00:49.850
<v Speaker 2>like the sauna and what that would do</v>
<v Speaker 2>for it.</v>

1311
01:00:49.880 --> 01:00:53.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then now it's already at a different</v>

1312
01:00:53.331 --> 01:00:54.590
<v Speaker 2>stage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I mean it's,</v>

1313
01:00:54.591 --> 01:00:55.820
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no,</v>

1314
01:00:55.821 --> 01:00:59.060
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no doubt the progression of this is</v>

1315
01:00:59.061 --> 01:01:00.680
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like anything,</v>

1316
01:01:00.681 --> 01:01:02.840
<v Speaker 2>it just gets better and better and</v>
<v Speaker 2>better and better.</v>

1317
01:01:02.900 --> 01:01:05.480
<v Speaker 2>What's interesting about rodey too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's great about Rodney,</v>

1318
01:01:05.481 --> 01:01:06.770
<v Speaker 2>I should say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rather than interesting,</v>

1319
01:01:06.771 --> 01:01:11.120
<v Speaker 2>is that Roddy is a student of medical</v>
<v Speaker 2>science as well as a practicing</v>

1320
01:01:11.121 --> 01:01:13.070
<v Speaker 2>physician and surgeon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a good point.</v>

1321
01:01:13.100 --> 01:01:15.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he's constantly on all the latest</v>

1322
01:01:15.411 --> 01:01:17.600
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not stagnant in any way,</v>

1323
01:01:17.660 --> 01:01:19.520
<v Speaker 2>shape or form.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's constantly up on it.</v>

1324
01:01:19.521 --> 01:01:21.350
<v Speaker 2>So every time I have a conversation with</v>
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>

1325
01:01:21.590 --> 01:01:23.630
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's some new research coming out of</v>

1326
01:01:23.631 --> 01:01:26.960
<v Speaker 2>this place that shows this and he's just</v>
<v Speaker 2>constantly on the ball with it.</v>

1327
01:01:27.260 --> 01:01:28.280
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1328
01:01:28.430 --> 01:01:30.980
<v Speaker 2>the most latest thing was this weekend.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1329
01:01:31.160 --> 01:01:33.230
<v Speaker 2>last time I saw him was just a couple</v>
<v Speaker 2>months before.</v>

1330
01:01:33.280 --> 01:01:36.230
<v Speaker 2>It's definitely on point with the stats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1331
01:01:39.400 --> 01:01:41.100
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We can't really match that on the</v>

1332
01:01:41.101 --> 01:01:41.934
<v Speaker 4>podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Boy,</v>

1333
01:01:42.510 --> 01:01:43.343
<v Speaker 4>we were,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1334
01:01:43.560 --> 01:01:45.210
<v Speaker 4>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had some speculation.</v>

1335
01:01:45.211 --> 01:01:50.211
<v Speaker 4>This activity's taking place in La and</v>
<v Speaker 4>Las Vegas rather on a daily basis what</v>

1336
01:01:50.491 --> 01:01:51.324
<v Speaker 4>they would be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

1337
01:01:51.910 --> 01:01:56.370
<v Speaker 4>my real big question was how many times</v>
<v Speaker 4>does a gay guy come in and other guy's</v>

1338
01:01:56.371 --> 01:02:01.210
<v Speaker 4>ass and yell out Woo in Vegas?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1339
01:02:01.320 --> 01:02:04.590
<v Speaker 4>how many times does he ric flair?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And Roddy was correct.</v>

1340
01:02:04.591 --> 01:02:05.760
<v Speaker 4>Roddy was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not every day.</v>

1341
01:02:05.761 --> 01:02:06.930
<v Speaker 4>And I think what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think you're right,</v>

1342
01:02:07.140 --> 01:02:09.180
<v Speaker 4>everybody else was like all day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>every day.</v>

1343
01:02:09.181 --> 01:02:10.290
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what are the odds?</v>

1344
01:02:10.350 --> 01:02:11.670

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1359
01:02:49.940 --> 01:02:52.340
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Vegas is a great place to get meals.</v>

1360
01:02:52.820 --> 01:02:55.900
<v Speaker 4>It's like one of the best restaurant</v>
<v Speaker 4>places in the country.</v>

1361
01:02:55.920 --> 01:02:58.410
<v Speaker 7>It really is.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I want a shout out to,</v>

1362
01:02:58.411 --> 01:03:00.600
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I want to hook up with Gordon Ramsay.</v>

1363
01:03:00.630 --> 01:03:04.860
<v Speaker 7>You did some,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you did some videos about hunting and</v>

1364
01:03:04.861 --> 01:03:07.800
<v Speaker 7>cooking wild game,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but you're missing out,</v>

1365
01:03:07.801 --> 01:03:09.450
<v Speaker 7>man.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You got to do this the right way.</v>

1366
01:03:09.480 --> 01:03:10.313
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's wrong.</v>

1367
01:03:11.140 --> 01:03:14.860
<v Speaker 7>He's missing out on,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it was kind of a cheesy rifle hunt with</v>

1368
01:03:14.861 --> 01:03:19.110
<v Speaker 7>the hog.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But I think we can do way better.</v>

1369
01:03:19.170 --> 01:03:21.360
<v Speaker 7>And one,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think he need to learn bow hunting</v>

1370
01:03:21.361 --> 01:03:24.000
<v Speaker 7>just because you're missing out if you</v>
<v Speaker 7>don't,</v>

1371
01:03:25.170 --> 01:03:28.260
<v Speaker 7>here's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Let me speak for Gordon Ramsay real</v>

1372
01:03:28.261 --> 01:03:30.100
<v Speaker 7>quick cause I met him,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I met him briefly in,</v>

1373
01:03:30.101 --> 01:03:32.490
<v Speaker 7>shook his hand and let's hear that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think I know him very well.</v>

1374
01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:35.050
<v Speaker 4>Let them for all 14,</v>
<v Speaker 4>15 seconds.</v>

1375
01:03:35.650 --> 01:03:36.940
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he doesn't have the time,</v>

1376
01:03:36.941 --> 01:03:38.800
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The guy's like 18 different TV shows.</v>

1377
01:03:38.801 --> 01:03:41.950
<v Speaker 4>I was watching them yell at some dude</v>
<v Speaker 4>who was cooking somewhere.</v>

1378
01:03:42.190 --> 01:03:43.930
<v Speaker 4>He was yelling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1379
01:03:44.080 --> 01:03:48.430
<v Speaker 4>oddly enough the guy was cooking elk and</v>
<v Speaker 4>Gordon was complaining about the elk.</v>

1380
01:03:48.431 --> 01:03:51.440
<v Speaker 4>It was complaining about it being tough</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it is inevitable.</v>

1381
01:03:51.460 --> 01:03:54.400
<v Speaker 4>Good complaint.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the guy aided,</v>

1382
01:03:54.430 --> 01:03:56.680
<v Speaker 4>he's chewing on and he said his tender</v>
<v Speaker 4>and delicious.</v>

1383
01:03:56.920 --> 01:04:00.910
<v Speaker 4>I'm more with the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think Gordon got a little,</v>

1384
01:04:01.030 --> 01:04:03.300
<v Speaker 4>he's doing a TV show up man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

1385
01:04:03.310 --> 01:04:05.170
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to be cynical.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is playing a character.</v>

1386
01:04:05.290 --> 01:04:07.780
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to be cynical,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's a re,</v>

1387
01:04:07.810 --> 01:04:10.450
<v Speaker 4>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the guy did step way over the line.</v>

1388
01:04:10.660 --> 01:04:14.800
<v Speaker 4>He said he was trained by some of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>greatest chefs in Europe and then Gordon</v>

1389
01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:16.840
<v Speaker 4>Ramsey called him on and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I never said that.</v>

1390
01:04:16.990 --> 01:04:18.700
<v Speaker 4>And then they had video,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they played back.</v>

1391
01:04:18.820 --> 01:04:21.670
<v Speaker 4>So that guy's obviously a dildo.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then on top of that,</v>

1392
01:04:22.180 --> 01:04:24.700
<v Speaker 4>unfortunately buddy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sometimes in life we're delta.</v>

1393
01:04:24.701 --> 01:04:26.950
<v Speaker 4>I've been Deldot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been a deldot more than once.</v>

1394
01:04:27.940 --> 01:04:32.110
<v Speaker 4>People know I haven't been deldot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I have been one not that way.</v>

1395
01:04:32.111 --> 01:04:35.320
<v Speaker 4>Not In the actual mechanical sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Anyway,</v>

1396
01:04:35.321 --> 01:04:38.110
<v Speaker 4>this guy was trying to explain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1397
01:04:38.170 --> 01:04:38.980
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>led,</v>

1398
01:04:38.980 --> 01:04:41.410
<v Speaker 4>he's not a chef,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then there was video footage of him</v>

1399
01:04:41.411 --> 01:04:45.100
<v Speaker 4>saying that he was a chef.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the bottom line is Gordon Ramsey,</v>

1400
01:04:45.101 --> 01:04:49.270
<v Speaker 4>he's playing it up and he's like talking</v>
<v Speaker 4>about how terrible the food is and</v>

1401
01:04:49.271 --> 01:04:50.140
<v Speaker 4>chatting on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

1402
01:04:50.141 --> 01:04:53.410
<v Speaker 4>that's his show.</v>
<v Speaker 4>His show was about sort of like kitchen</v>

1403
01:04:53.411 --> 01:04:55.570
<v Speaker 4>nightmares.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like I show up and you show has to</v>

1404
01:04:55.571 --> 01:04:57.700
<v Speaker 4>be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your kitchen has to be a nightmare for</v>

1405
01:04:57.701 --> 01:04:59.110
<v Speaker 4>kitchen nightmares.</v>
<v Speaker 4>T to work.</v>

1406
01:04:59.111 --> 01:04:59.650
<v Speaker 4>That's the guy.</v>

1407
01:04:59.650 --> 01:05:01.540
<v Speaker 4>That's the gentleman.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We don't need to play this guy.</v>

1408
01:05:01.660 --> 01:05:04.420
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to shame this young man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this young man.</v>

1409
01:05:04.421 --> 01:05:05.860
<v Speaker 4>He's on the young man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a shame.</v>

1410
01:05:05.861 --> 01:05:08.020
<v Speaker 4>This guy shit all over.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Awesome.</v>

1411
01:05:08.230 --> 01:05:12.070
<v Speaker 4>But don't you think this is a lot like a</v>
<v Speaker 4>guy who doesn't really know archery</v>

1412
01:05:12.820 --> 01:05:16.290
<v Speaker 4>talking shit to you?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like your Gordon Ramsay and that guy's</v>

1413
01:05:16.310 --> 01:05:17.310

<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1414
01:05:17.330 --> 01:05:20.200
<v Speaker 4>I've been finger shooting my whole life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't need a release.</v>

1415
01:05:20.670 --> 01:05:22.720
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't use a site because I shoot</v>

1416
01:05:22.721 --> 01:05:24.040
<v Speaker 4>instinctive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you're like,</v>

1417
01:05:24.041 --> 01:05:25.810
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're just not going to be accurate.</v>

1418
01:05:25.880 --> 01:05:26.381
<v Speaker 4>And you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1419
01:05:26.381 --> 01:05:28.030
<v Speaker 4>I'm accurate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm accurate.</v>

1420
01:05:28.180 --> 01:05:30.160
<v Speaker 4>And then he shoots and he misses the</v>
<v Speaker 4>target and you're like,</v>

1421
01:05:30.161 --> 01:05:31.630
<v Speaker 4>see,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I told Ya and then,</v>

1422
01:05:31.631 --> 01:05:35.080
<v Speaker 4>but you're a nice guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Gordon Ramsey is a professional asshole.</v>

1423
01:05:35.320 --> 01:05:38.770
<v Speaker 4>And I don't mean that in a bad way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I mean when someone fucks up,</v>

1424
01:05:38.800 --> 01:05:41.140
<v Speaker 4>that guy comes down and you with the</v>
<v Speaker 4>hammer of truth,</v>

1425
01:05:42.340 --> 01:05:43.630
<v Speaker 4>it's brutal to watch.</v>

1426
01:05:44.320 --> 01:05:46.120
<v Speaker 4>My seven year old was so annoyed at me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's like,</v>

1427
01:05:46.121 --> 01:05:49.530
<v Speaker 4>why are you still watching this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because we were in the morning,</v>

1428
01:05:50.020 --> 01:05:52.630
<v Speaker 4>she's someone else.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She wanted a roll around on the</v>

1429
01:05:52.631 --> 01:05:54.700
<v Speaker 4>hoverboards and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just relax one second.</v>

1430
01:05:54.701 --> 01:05:57.030
<v Speaker 4>I want to see where this goes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because they were,</v>

1431
01:05:57.160 --> 01:06:00.880
<v Speaker 4>the guy was like talking about Gordon</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ramsey did not know how to cook elk.</v>

1432
01:06:01.590 --> 01:06:03.760
<v Speaker 4>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But then I was watching him cook calc.</v>

1433
01:06:03.761 --> 01:06:04.541
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ooh,</v>

1434
01:06:04.541 --> 01:06:06.970
<v Speaker 4>I don't think you know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>See,</v>

1435
01:06:06.971 --> 01:06:09.010
<v Speaker 4>that's what I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He needs to learn.</v>

1436
01:06:09.670 --> 01:06:14.140
<v Speaker 4>But here's my argument.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't have time for archery there.</v>

1437
01:06:15.280 --> 01:06:16.600
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm crazy.</v>

1438
01:06:17.080 --> 01:06:19.190
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have a real many,</v>

1439
01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:21.130
<v Speaker 4>I need,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I need,</v>

1440
01:06:21.340 --> 01:06:23.080
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>need Gordon to get crazy.</v>

1441
01:06:23.800 --> 01:06:26.320
<v Speaker 4>He's not going to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not the same guy.</v>

1442
01:06:27.400 --> 01:06:29.830
<v Speaker 4>I think he goes at archery.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Find the people that you don't want to</v>

1443
01:06:29.831 --> 01:06:30.670
<v Speaker 4>think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Actually,</v>

1444
01:06:30.671 --> 01:06:32.860
<v Speaker 4>it's like a game of Tetris,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

1445
01:06:33.190 --> 01:06:34.870
<v Speaker 4>As well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>falling in place.</v>

1446
01:06:34.871 --> 01:06:36.520
<v Speaker 4>You've got to figure out where it falls</v>
<v Speaker 4>in place.</v>

1447
01:06:36.700 --> 01:06:39.070
<v Speaker 4>You can't foresee English.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So Gordon,</v>

1448
01:06:39.370 --> 01:06:39.941
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>same thing.</v>

1449
01:06:39.941 --> 01:06:41.770
<v Speaker 4>Give it a try.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Basically the same thing.</v>

1450
01:06:41.800 --> 01:06:42.820
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1451
01:06:43.090 --> 01:06:44.370
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1452
01:06:44.590 --> 01:06:45.850
<v Speaker 4>that's her,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's her.</v>

1453
01:06:46.150 --> 01:06:48.940
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she was completely,</v>

1454
01:06:48.970 --> 01:06:53.320
<v Speaker 4>she had no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>literally no perspective to hunting</v>

1455
01:06:53.440 --> 01:06:55.270
<v Speaker 4>before we met.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1456
01:06:55.271 --> 01:06:57.880
<v Speaker 4>imagine Sharon and I met on a plane to</v>
<v Speaker 4>France.</v>

1457
01:06:58.600 --> 01:07:01.720
<v Speaker 4>We met again on the plane back from</v>
<v Speaker 4>France.</v>

1458
01:07:02.530 --> 01:07:05.800
<v Speaker 4>She was from England.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was from the u s I just happened to be</v>

1459
01:07:05.801 --> 01:07:08.770
<v Speaker 4>routing through Liverpool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>

1460
01:07:08.771 --> 01:07:09.604
<v Speaker 4>I appreciate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we talked,</v>

1461
01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:11.620
<v Speaker 4>might not have talked about it on the</v>
<v Speaker 4>podcast,</v>

1462
01:07:11.621 --> 01:07:13.180
<v Speaker 4>but I think did I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1463
01:07:13.181 --> 01:07:14.410
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's a great story.</v>

1464
01:07:14.440 --> 01:07:16.090
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is a very good story,</v>

1465
01:07:16.091 --> 01:07:16.871
<v Speaker 4>better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then you're like,</v>

1466
01:07:16.871 --> 01:07:17.860
<v Speaker 4>damn,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why didn't get her number?</v>

1467
01:07:17.861 --> 01:07:19.750
<v Speaker 4>And then you met her again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hollywood.</v>

1468
01:07:20.200 --> 01:07:22.660
<v Speaker 4>We need a movie called love at first</v>
<v Speaker 4>flight.</v>

1469
01:07:23.020 --> 01:07:25.790
<v Speaker 4>This is it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can uh,</v>

1470
01:07:25.870 --> 01:07:29.800
<v Speaker 4>have nicholas cage play an archer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I'm just going to go out on a limb</v>

1471
01:07:29.801 --> 01:07:33.820
<v Speaker 4>which say terrible job.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She is from England does not mean that</v>

1472
01:07:33.821 --> 01:07:37.930
<v Speaker 4>they're the same thing that him and her</v>
<v Speaker 4>just like already laying is also from</v>

1473
01:07:37.931 --> 01:07:41.980
<v Speaker 4>America and he is not as same as me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We are different.</v>

1474
01:07:43.630 --> 01:07:47.470
<v Speaker 4>He has way more experience with</v>
<v Speaker 4>pharmaceutical drugs and heroin.</v>

1475
01:07:47.680 --> 01:07:51.730
<v Speaker 4>And I have a more experience shooting</v>
<v Speaker 4>animals with a pole and Arrow and it</v>

1476
01:07:51.740 --> 01:07:53.610
<v Speaker 4>will always be such,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1477
01:07:53.620 --> 01:07:55.480
<v Speaker 4>do whatever you want to do in this life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1478
01:07:55.510 --> 01:07:58.690
<v Speaker 4>I don't think he needs to go out and</v>
<v Speaker 4>hunt with a bow and arrow.</v>

1479
01:07:59.370 --> 01:08:02.830
<v Speaker 4>The one thing is it would require a</v>
<v Speaker 4>tremendous learning curve.</v>

1480
01:08:03.610 --> 01:08:07.090
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Especially like my first experiences</v>

1481
01:08:07.091 --> 01:08:08.080
<v Speaker 4>were,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1482
01:08:08.320 --> 01:08:12.670
<v Speaker 4>bears over Bait,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is a much easier proposition.</v>

1483
01:08:12.700 --> 01:08:15.830
<v Speaker 4>It's a very controlled situation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But is,</v>

1484
01:08:16.310 --> 01:08:18.200
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think controlled situations are</v>

1485
01:08:18.201 --> 01:08:19.820
<v Speaker 1>important for any beginner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1486
01:08:19.830 --> 01:08:21.380
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

1487
01:08:21.490 --> 01:08:22.323
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sparring,</v>

1488
01:08:22.460 --> 01:08:27.110
<v Speaker 1>when you teach people how to fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the first things I suggest always</v>

1489
01:08:27.160 --> 01:08:29.870
<v Speaker 1>they spar and advanced belt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They spar.</v>

1490
01:08:29.880 --> 01:08:31.290
<v Speaker 1>Someone's not going to hurt them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1491
01:08:31.310 --> 01:08:34.820
<v Speaker 1>mark talked about that at dinner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We talked about a sparring.</v>

1492
01:08:34.910 --> 01:08:35.810
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1493
01:08:35.990 --> 01:08:37.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we can,</v>

1494
01:08:37.100 --> 01:08:38.990
<v Speaker 1>you can read it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mark and I,</v>

1495
01:08:39.160 --> 01:08:39.881
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

1496
01:08:39.881 --> 01:08:41.690
<v Speaker 1>we haven't asked the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1497
01:08:42.230 --> 01:08:43.400
<v Speaker 1>Mark and I actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1498
01:08:43.430 --> 01:08:45.410
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I played a video for him that I was</v>

1499
01:08:45.411 --> 01:08:46.610
<v Speaker 1>really disturbed about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

1500
01:08:46.710 --> 01:08:48.380
<v Speaker 1>we actually played it yesterday on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast.</v>

1501
01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:50.180
<v Speaker 1>Did you have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a heavy virgil.</v>

1502
01:08:50.200 --> 01:08:51.620
<v Speaker 1>I haven't watched it yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1503
01:08:51.621 --> 01:08:54.160
<v Speaker 1>Yesterday wasn't surgical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brendan Shab and Brian Kale,</v>

1504
01:08:54.930 --> 01:08:56.360
<v Speaker 1>we talked about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1505
01:08:57.110 --> 01:09:00.530
<v Speaker 1>heavy sparring that there's guys that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are hitting each other as hard as they</v>

1506
01:09:00.531 --> 01:09:02.300
<v Speaker 1>possibly can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And all that is,</v>

1507
01:09:02.301 --> 01:09:03.560
<v Speaker 1>is like an ego exercise.</v>

1508
01:09:03.560 --> 01:09:05.630
<v Speaker 1>You're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not getting better.</v>

1509
01:09:05.720 --> 01:09:08.600
<v Speaker 1>You're hurting each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're fucking each other's brains up.</v>

1510
01:09:09.260 --> 01:09:12.470
<v Speaker 1>And Mark and I were talking about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like how many guys get turned off to</v>

1511
01:09:12.471 --> 01:09:16.910
<v Speaker 1>sparring because they spar with someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>who just beats the shit out of him in a</v>

1512
01:09:16.911 --> 01:09:21.710
<v Speaker 1>bad gym rather than spars with someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>who teaches you just to get touched.</v>

1513
01:09:21.760 --> 01:09:23.960
<v Speaker 1>You just get touched in the face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know you got hit,</v>

1514
01:09:24.260 --> 01:09:27.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and someone who's fast but has control</v>

1515
01:09:27.290 --> 01:09:30.760
<v Speaker 1>and then you learn how to operate</v>
<v Speaker 1>without the,</v>

1516
01:09:31.010 --> 01:09:34.970
<v Speaker 1>the fear and consequences of like a wild</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jim Brawl,</v>

1517
01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.700
<v Speaker 1>which is like really common.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of gyms,</v>

1518
01:09:37.730 --> 01:09:41.420
<v Speaker 1>they have brawls where it should be just</v>
<v Speaker 1>sparring,</v>

1519
01:09:41.421 --> 01:09:43.730
<v Speaker 1>but instead you're really just fighting</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the time.</v>

1520
01:09:43.731 --> 01:09:46.340
<v Speaker 1>You're fighting constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those people always wind up with brain</v>

1521
01:09:46.341 --> 01:09:48.410
<v Speaker 1>damage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like almost always.</v>

1522
01:09:48.950 --> 01:09:53.030
<v Speaker 1>So Real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>real issue with a lot of,</v>

1523
01:09:53.050 --> 01:09:56.930
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>low level gyms or gyms where people</v>

1524
01:09:56.931 --> 01:10:00.290
<v Speaker 1>haven't really considered the</v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences of their actions.</v>

1525
01:10:00.440 --> 01:10:01.850
<v Speaker 1>Did you uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1526
01:10:01.851 --> 01:10:04.820
<v Speaker 1>That's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you play that video that you showed</v>

1527
01:10:05.060 --> 01:10:07.250
<v Speaker 1>when we were at dinner?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other guy get knocked out?</v>

1528
01:10:07.340 --> 01:10:08.240
<v Speaker 1>Is that what it want?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1529
01:10:08.241 --> 01:10:09.170
<v Speaker 1>that's the one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1530
01:10:09.530 --> 01:10:10.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mark was like,</v>

1531
01:10:10.670 --> 01:10:13.880
<v Speaker 1>this would never happen at his gym.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never happened.</v>

1532
01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.100
<v Speaker 1>Mark's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's important.</v>

1533
01:10:16.130 --> 01:10:17.360
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any type of,</v>

1534
01:10:17.780 --> 01:10:22.780
<v Speaker 1>any type of beginner needs a controlled</v>
<v Speaker 1>situation and you need training wheels.</v>

1535
01:10:23.121 --> 01:10:24.290
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1536
01:10:24.590 --> 01:10:29.590
<v Speaker 1>it's important and there's that feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well this is what I've been preaching</v>

1537
01:10:29.661 --> 01:10:32.870
<v Speaker 1>forever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that feeling of not knowing how to do</v>

1538
01:10:32.871 --> 01:10:35.630
<v Speaker 1>something and trying to figure it out is</v>
<v Speaker 1>crucial.</v>

1539
01:10:36.110 --> 01:10:39.020
<v Speaker 1>As a human being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we're human stagnate.</v>

1540
01:10:39.200 --> 01:10:42.290
<v Speaker 1>That feeling makes people feel weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't like being a loser.</v>

1541
01:10:42.320 --> 01:10:44.180
<v Speaker 1>They don't like being a beginner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't like it.</v>

1542
01:10:44.600 --> 01:10:49.600
<v Speaker 1>But I think that feeling is crucial</v>
<v Speaker 1>because when you get really good at</v>

1543
01:10:50.241 --> 01:10:55.010
<v Speaker 1>something and you get stagnant and you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't worry about it anymore,</v>

1544
01:10:55.011 --> 01:10:56.660
<v Speaker 1>there's no growth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no movement.</v>

1545
01:10:56.990 --> 01:10:59.930
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something about that that's very</v>

1546
01:10:59.931 --> 01:11:04.931
<v Speaker 1>detrimental to the human psyche.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very detrimental to your growth and</v>

1547
01:11:05.271 --> 01:11:09.740
<v Speaker 1>your a constant self examination,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which a lot of people don't like,</v>

1548
01:11:09.800 --> 01:11:11.860
<v Speaker 1>but I think is important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is why I think it's,</v>

1549
01:11:11.970 --> 01:11:15.660
<v Speaker 1>I think it's important for peace of mind</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I think it may bring rocky</v>

1550
01:11:15.661 --> 01:11:20.190
<v Speaker 1>moments where you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't like what you find and you</v>

1551
01:11:20.191 --> 01:11:21.090
<v Speaker 1>just feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

1552
01:11:21.091 --> 01:11:23.850
<v Speaker 1>can I just just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just be cool with everything and real.</v>

1553
01:11:24.210 --> 01:11:28.350
<v Speaker 1>But I think through that path,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those rocky moments,</v>

1554
01:11:28.351 --> 01:11:33.351
<v Speaker 1>you get to understand yourself in a very</v>
<v Speaker 1>pure way versus understanding the</v>

1555
01:11:36.091 --> 01:11:39.060
<v Speaker 1>projection of who you would like people</v>
<v Speaker 1>to think you are,</v>

1556
01:11:39.360 --> 01:11:43.260
<v Speaker 1>which is what most people exist in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most people exist in this world of</v>

1557
01:11:43.290 --> 01:11:48.290
<v Speaker 1>slippery shoes and shiny fucking cars</v>
<v Speaker 1>and ties and wearing the right things</v>

1558
01:11:50.371 --> 01:11:53.610
<v Speaker 1>and saying the right things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All those things are sort of designed to</v>

1559
01:11:53.611 --> 01:11:56.700
<v Speaker 1>project an image that's not necessarily</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

1560
01:11:57.060 --> 01:12:00.960
<v Speaker 1>It's a cheap way of getting people to</v>
<v Speaker 1>think greater of you.</v>

1561
01:12:01.740 --> 01:12:05.720
<v Speaker 1>Whereas the only way that people think</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the really know who you are is see</v>

1562
01:12:05.721 --> 01:12:08.060
<v Speaker 1>you doing something hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see,</v>

1563
01:12:08.061 --> 01:12:10.380
<v Speaker 1>see you doing something difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't know who you are.</v>

1564
01:12:10.381 --> 01:12:13.740
<v Speaker 1>If you show up and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the camera's start flash and you're on</v>

1565
01:12:13.741 --> 01:12:15.660
<v Speaker 1>the red car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're in the perfect suit,</v>

1566
01:12:15.661 --> 01:12:18.390
<v Speaker 1>you hop out of a limo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got a gorgeous girl and your arm</v>

1567
01:12:18.420 --> 01:12:20.790
<v Speaker 1>don't know Jack Shit about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks amazing.</v>

1568
01:12:20.791 --> 01:12:22.770
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to be that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody would,</v>

1569
01:12:22.980 --> 01:12:24.840
<v Speaker 1>but they don't know God damn thing about</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1570
01:12:24.990 --> 01:12:29.990
<v Speaker 1>but if they saw you at mile 59 of a 200</v>
<v Speaker 1>mile race and you're shitting yourself</v>

1571
01:12:30.691 --> 01:12:32.910
<v Speaker 1>over a cactus in the middle of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>funnel,</v>

1572
01:12:33.390 --> 01:12:35.580
<v Speaker 1>in the middle of the mountains,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the campaigns,</v>

1573
01:12:35.880 --> 01:12:40.440
<v Speaker 1>then then they would know who you really</v>
<v Speaker 1>are and I think this is also one of the</v>

1574
01:12:40.441 --> 01:12:41.700
<v Speaker 1>reasons why a guy like you,</v>

1575
01:12:42.330 --> 01:12:46.260
<v Speaker 7>you're hesitant close to yes,</v>
<v Speaker 7>my litmus sex is hunting.</v>

1576
01:12:46.810 --> 01:12:47.940
<v Speaker 7>Well it's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean not hard.</v>

1577
01:12:48.420 --> 01:12:52.500
<v Speaker 7>If I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if I ever really am at a point where I</v>

1578
01:12:52.501 --> 01:12:57.501
<v Speaker 7>feel like is this going to be a</v>
<v Speaker 7>legitimate friend or is this going to be</v>

1579
01:12:59.280 --> 01:13:03.270
<v Speaker 7>someone that I just do business with,</v>
<v Speaker 7>then that's,</v>

1580
01:13:03.630 --> 01:13:08.630
<v Speaker 7>that's where I test it is in something</v>
<v Speaker 7>tough because those people,</v>

1581
01:13:10.890 --> 01:13:13.170
<v Speaker 7>to me,</v>
<v Speaker 7>those people put themselves,</v>

1582
01:13:15.120 --> 01:13:19.890
<v Speaker 7>you're probably the same.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There's maybe six or seven people that I</v>

1583
01:13:19.891 --> 01:13:24.810
<v Speaker 7>talk to on a daily basis and then</v>
<v Speaker 7>there's like a different tier to that,</v>

1584
01:13:25.530 --> 01:13:27.950
<v Speaker 7>but that is my litmus test.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If,</v>

1585
01:13:27.970 --> 01:13:32.970
<v Speaker 7>if people can can do those things and</v>
<v Speaker 7>really proved themselves like at the</v>

1586
01:13:34.171 --> 01:13:34.951
<v Speaker 7>tough,</v>
<v Speaker 7>tough,</v>

1587
01:13:34.951 --> 01:13:36.900
<v Speaker 7>tough times.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If you handle it.</v>

1588
01:13:36.960 --> 01:13:38.190
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If they can handle it.</v>

1589
01:13:38.191 --> 01:13:39.690
<v Speaker 7>Those are the people that I want around</v>
<v Speaker 7>me.</v>

1590
01:13:39.691 --> 01:13:43.120
<v Speaker 7>That's the tree for fuel,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right know.</v>

1591
01:13:43.440 --> 01:13:45.420
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>because when you're ready to be like,</v>

1592
01:13:48.150 --> 01:13:50.610
<v Speaker 7>should I just take a break right now and</v>
<v Speaker 7>they're still going.</v>

1593
01:13:50.650 --> 01:13:53.000
<v Speaker 7>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm not going to let him beat me cause</v>

1594
01:13:53.001 --> 01:13:56.580
<v Speaker 7>he was going to ride me at the end.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Have you seen ever seen Jockos video?</v>

<v Speaker 1>Find that.</v>

1597
01:14:02.650 --> 01:14:05.530
<v Speaker 1>It's one of my favorite videos on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Internet.</v>

1598
01:14:05.710 --> 01:14:07.300
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of videos on the Internet.</v>

1599
01:14:07.970 --> 01:14:12.140
<v Speaker 7>Crazy isn't the world that Jacko and I</v>
<v Speaker 7>met in</v>

1600
01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:14.380
<v Speaker 5>an,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we literally pass each other in an</v>

1601
01:14:14.381 --> 01:14:15.820
<v Speaker 5>airport.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Pretty crazy.</v>

1602
01:14:15.880 --> 01:14:18.820
<v Speaker 5>Took,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we both had a just enough time to take a</v>

1603
01:14:18.821 --> 01:14:22.720
<v Speaker 5>selfie and we texted it to you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Remember that?</v>

1604
01:14:22.780 --> 01:14:24.450
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1605
01:14:24.480 --> 01:14:25.710
<v Speaker 5>It was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's,</v>

1606
01:14:25.720 --> 01:14:28.750
<v Speaker 5>we're going to play it because this one</v>
<v Speaker 5>thing I know the Jocko would never flag</v>

1607
01:14:28.751 --> 01:14:29.584
<v Speaker 5>us off youtube.</v>

1608
01:14:29.840 --> 01:14:33.530
<v Speaker 8>One of my direct subordinates,</v>
<v Speaker 8>one of my guys that worked for me,</v>

1609
01:14:33.590 --> 01:14:36.290
<v Speaker 8>he would,</v>
<v Speaker 8>he would call me up or pull me aside</v>

1610
01:14:36.291 --> 01:14:40.160
<v Speaker 8>with some major problem,</v>
<v Speaker 8>some issue that was going on and he'd</v>

1611
01:14:40.161 --> 01:14:40.540
<v Speaker 8>say,</v>
<v Speaker 8>boss,</v>

1612
01:14:40.540 --> 01:14:42.080
<v Speaker 8>we got this and that and the other</v>
<v Speaker 8>thing.</v>

1613
01:14:42.290 --> 01:14:44.240
<v Speaker 8>And I look at him and I'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 8>good.</v>

1614
01:14:45.590 --> 01:14:49.460
<v Speaker 8>And finally one day he was telling me</v>
<v Speaker 8>about some issue that he was having some</v>

1615
01:14:49.461 --> 01:14:52.840
<v Speaker 8>problem and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I already know what you're going to say.</v>

1616
01:14:54.140 --> 01:14:54.551
<v Speaker 8>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 8>well,</v>

1617
01:14:54.551 --> 01:14:56.320
<v Speaker 8>what am I going to say?</v>
<v Speaker 8>You said you're going to say good.</v>

1618
01:14:56.430 --> 01:14:57.850
<v Speaker 9>Uh,</v>

1619
01:14:59.120 --> 01:15:00.800
<v Speaker 8>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 8>that's what you always say when</v>

1620
01:15:00.801 --> 01:15:05.210
<v Speaker 8>something is wrong in going bad.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You always just look at me and say good.</v>

1621
01:15:07.490 --> 01:15:08.151
<v Speaker 8>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 8>well,</v>

01:15:08.151 --> 01:15:13.151
<v Speaker 8>yeah,</v>

1623
01:15:13.261 --> 01:15:15.770
<v Speaker 8>to be some good that's going to come</v>
<v Speaker 8>from it.</v>

1624
01:15:17.010 --> 01:15:19.530
<v Speaker 10>Didn't get the new high speed gear we</v>
<v Speaker 10>wanted.</v>

1628
01:15:30.590 --> 01:15:33.260

<v Speaker 10>didn't get the job you wanted.</v>

01:15:47.810 --> 01:15:51.170
<v Speaker 10>We have the opportunity to figure out a</v>
<v Speaker 10>solution.</v>

1633
01:15:53.070 --> 01:15:55.140
<v Speaker 8>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>When things are going bad,</v>

1634
01:15:56.670 --> 01:15:57.750
<v Speaker 8>don't get all bummed out.</v>

1635
01:15:57.800 --> 01:15:59.840
<v Speaker 10>Don't get startled.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Don't get frustrated.</v>

1636
01:16:04.450 --> 01:16:08.900
<v Speaker 10>If you can say the word good,</v>

<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

01:16:40.200 --> 01:16:44.730
<v Speaker 5>you need to go to a doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Can people hear that on the podcast?</v>

1647
01:16:44.910 --> 01:16:49.080
<v Speaker 5>If like downloading the itunes that hear</v>
<v Speaker 5>that for sure.</v>

1648
01:16:49.081 --> 01:16:50.040
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're playing that.</v>

1649
01:16:50.430 --> 01:16:52.380
<v Speaker 5>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you listen to an empty friends in</v>

1650
01:16:52.381 --> 01:16:53.910
<v Speaker 5>here,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'd punch someone in the face,</v>

1651
01:16:53.911 --> 01:16:56.730
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want to shoot a broadhead through</v>

1652
01:16:56.731 --> 01:17:00.840
<v Speaker 5>someone's neck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what Jocko is all about.</v>

1653
01:17:00.841 --> 01:17:01.740
<v Speaker 5>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When I run,</v>

1654
01:17:01.770 --> 01:17:04.470
<v Speaker 5>I literally hear that sometimes when I'm</v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking exhausted,</v>

1655
01:17:04.471 --> 01:17:06.690
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to hit the high hills.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Never ran to that.</v>

1656
01:17:06.691 --> 01:17:07.524
<v Speaker 5>If I did,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'd,</v>

1657
01:17:07.680 --> 01:17:11.120
<v Speaker 5>I wouldn't even be here right now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Die of a heart attack somewhere out of</v>

1658
01:17:11.121 --> 01:17:15.500
<v Speaker 5>fricking had a cardiac arrest.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't listen to it too.</v>

1659
01:17:15.620 --> 01:17:18.330
<v Speaker 5>When I run because I really believe that</v>
<v Speaker 5>listening to music when you're running</v>

1660
01:17:18.331 --> 01:17:20.510
<v Speaker 5>is cheating.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why?</v>

1661
01:17:21.380 --> 01:17:23.060
<v Speaker 5>Why try?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cause that's easier.</v>

1662
01:17:23.410 --> 01:17:25.430
<v Speaker 5>Are you kidding?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm serious.</v>

1663
01:17:25.431 --> 01:17:27.320
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well I think that when you run,</v>

1664
01:17:27.350 --> 01:17:30.260
<v Speaker 5>it should be in your mind.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You should be,</v>

1665
01:17:30.380 --> 01:17:33.830
<v Speaker 5>you're such an issue with your thoughts</v>
<v Speaker 5>alone.</v>

1666
01:17:33.860 --> 01:17:35.840
<v Speaker 5>And I think that when you run and you</v>
<v Speaker 5>listen to music,</v>

1667
01:17:35.841 --> 01:17:37.870
<v Speaker 5>it's easier.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Therefore it's cheating.</v>

1668
01:17:40.770 --> 01:17:44.560
<v Speaker 5>I'm pissed right now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Last time,</v>

1669
01:17:44.800 --> 01:17:49.760
<v Speaker 5>two homos running with your walkmans</v>
<v Speaker 5>with your ear plugs on.</v>

1670
01:17:50.360 --> 01:17:51.860
<v Speaker 5>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 5>go five miles.</v>

1671
01:17:51.861 --> 01:17:54.200
<v Speaker 5>Then their ear buds.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You think it's different?</v>

1672
01:17:54.890 --> 01:17:57.350
<v Speaker 5>It's different to go two miles and five</v>
<v Speaker 5>miles to do.</v>

1673
01:17:57.351 --> 01:17:58.940
<v Speaker 5>You need,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can do two miles in 20 minutes.</v>

1674
01:17:58.990 --> 01:18:00.710
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>But can you do two miles in the hills?</v>

1675
01:18:01.010 --> 01:18:04.700
<v Speaker 5>Tribe miles is probably easier to to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just overall,</v>

1676
01:18:04.701 --> 01:18:06.590
<v Speaker 5>it's as longer distracting an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

1677
01:18:06.620 --> 01:18:08.240
<v Speaker 5>So you have to listen to music.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You,</v>

1678
01:18:08.241 --> 01:18:09.860
<v Speaker 5>Brittany Spears gets you through the</v>
<v Speaker 5>last three.</v>

1679
01:18:09.920 --> 01:18:12.970
<v Speaker 5>Don't have to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it helps with like the mind games.</v>

1680
01:18:13.180 --> 01:18:14.300
<v Speaker 5>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure.</v>

1681
01:18:14.330 --> 01:18:15.740
<v Speaker 5>But that's the whole idea.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's cheating.</v>

1682
01:18:16.310 --> 01:18:18.980
<v Speaker 5>I'm pissed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I was wearing shoes then.</v>

1683
01:18:19.520 --> 01:18:20.353
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're right.</v>

1684
01:18:20.480 --> 01:18:21.380
<v Speaker 5>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It is wearing.</v>

1685
01:18:21.800 --> 01:18:24.320
<v Speaker 5>Wearing shoes is cheating.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What?</v>

1686
01:18:24.560 --> 01:18:25.430
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you should be careful.</v>

1687
01:18:25.431 --> 01:18:27.770
<v Speaker 5>Here we go.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We were watching a video the other day</v>

1688
01:18:27.771 --> 01:18:29.360
<v Speaker 5>that Jamie almost made me throw up.</v>

1689
01:18:29.360 --> 01:18:32.930
<v Speaker 5>It was a dude who was carving off of his</v>
<v Speaker 5>callouses with a knife.</v>

1690
01:18:33.500 --> 01:18:36.650
<v Speaker 5>He had cows that were so thick.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He had a knife out and he was carving</v>

1691
01:18:36.651 --> 01:18:38.720
<v Speaker 5>the cows off and then a dog was eating</v>
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>

1692
01:18:39.500 --> 01:18:41.690
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know about the dog eating part,</v>

1693
01:18:41.720 --> 01:18:45.260
<v Speaker 5>but I've definitely carved up calluses.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ever seen counselors like this?</v>

1694
01:18:45.530 --> 01:18:46.130
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I dunno.</v>

1695
01:18:46.130 --> 01:18:49.730
<v Speaker 5>This guy looked like he'd been walking</v>
<v Speaker 5>barefoot for several years.</v>

1696
01:18:49.760 --> 01:18:53.300
<v Speaker 5>I'm just pissed because last time I was</v>
<v Speaker 5>here you talked about the fact</v>

1697
01:18:55.050 --> 01:18:58.430
<v Speaker 5>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Would I talk about last?</v>

1698
01:18:58.431 --> 01:19:00.530
<v Speaker 5>Do we have that coin flipped over</v>
<v Speaker 5>saying,</v>

1699
01:19:00.531 --> 01:19:01.430
<v Speaker 5>yes,</v>

1816
01:24:20.080 --> 01:24:22.930
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1817
01:24:23.020 --> 01:24:26.620
<v Speaker 5>definitely too small,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so she was looking at some of those,</v>

01:25:31.990 --> 01:25:33.850
<v Speaker 5>you're not connected.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is that a bad thing though?</v>

1835
01:25:33.851 --> 01:25:36.380
<v Speaker 5>I know it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's weird and it's that bad.</v>

1836
01:25:36.570 --> 01:25:39.000
<v Speaker 5>I mean at at potentially you could view</v>
<v Speaker 5>that as something like,</v>

1837
01:25:39.040 --> 01:25:42.130
<v Speaker 5>I would probably want to buy that and</v>
<v Speaker 5>now that it's here in an easier way for</v>

1838
01:25:42.131 --> 01:25:43.810
<v Speaker 5>me to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that is kind of,</v>

1839
01:25:43.900 --> 01:25:44.810
<v Speaker 5>I'm just going,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jamie,</v>

1840
01:25:45.430 --> 01:25:47.290
<v Speaker 5>if you say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God,</v>

1841
01:25:47.291 --> 01:25:50.140
<v Speaker 5>I'm gonna die out here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>At that time,</v>

1842
01:25:50.141 --> 01:25:53.440
<v Speaker 5>Siri can step in and say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>would you like me to call a helicopter?</v>

1843
01:25:54.940 --> 01:25:59.050
<v Speaker 5>But when you're looking at rubber rings</v>
<v Speaker 5>for your wedding ring and then it shows</v>

1844
01:25:59.051 --> 01:26:00.550
<v Speaker 5>up on your laptop.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1845
01:26:00.970 --> 01:26:05.180
<v Speaker 5>At that point he's a sell.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Get to the bottom of this.</v>

1846
01:26:05.570 --> 01:26:09.290
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it most certainly exists with Google</v>

1847
01:26:09.650 --> 01:26:11.510
<v Speaker 5>because I've,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've looked at like,</v>

1848
01:26:11.920 --> 01:26:12.753
<v Speaker 5>what are you?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cheers.</v>

1849
01:26:13.400 --> 01:26:15.920
<v Speaker 5>I've looked at some,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're milking it over there.</v>

1850
01:26:15.980 --> 01:26:17.330
<v Speaker 5>I'm all right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sadly,</v>

1851
01:26:17.960 --> 01:26:19.220
<v Speaker 5>I smoked pot though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You didn't.</v>

1852
01:26:19.490 --> 01:26:20.710
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you did a little sh.</v>

1853
01:26:20.810 --> 01:26:25.280
<v Speaker 5>Don't tell any sponsors.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I might've made that last part up.</v>

1854
01:26:25.700 --> 01:26:28.070
<v Speaker 5>This.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The problem is like you'll be looking at</v>

1855
01:26:28.071 --> 01:26:33.071
<v Speaker 5>something super obscure like a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a casio watch sound like casio.</v>

1856
01:26:35.180 --> 01:26:36.013
<v Speaker 5>That's Cassio.</v>

1857
01:26:37.540 --> 01:26:39.070
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>All right.</v>

1858
01:26:39.440 --> 01:26:40.670
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it has its good one.</v>

1859
01:26:40.671 --> 01:26:42.740
<v Speaker 5>I like this one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like a pro tech and that totally</v>

1860
01:26:42.741 --> 01:26:45.200
<v Speaker 5>doesn't limiter and a an accomplice in</v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

1861
01:26:45.201 --> 01:26:46.310
<v Speaker 5>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't look like it.</v>

1862
01:26:46.400 --> 01:26:47.710
<v Speaker 5>It is a casio Lord.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Come on.</v>

1863
01:26:47.711 --> 01:26:49.540
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no shit</v>

1864
01:26:51.350 --> 01:26:54.290
<v Speaker 5>but the eye,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but then all of a sudden it'll show you</v>

1865
01:26:54.440 --> 01:26:56.720
<v Speaker 5>whatever you search for,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever it was,</v>

1866
01:26:56.721 --> 01:27:00.230
<v Speaker 5>whether it's surf ports or fucking Hilda</v>
<v Speaker 5>Berg tents.</v>

1867
01:27:00.410 --> 01:27:05.010
<v Speaker 5>There'll be for sale and you'll see like</v>
<v Speaker 5>amazon.com ads for like what?</v>

1868
01:27:05.070 --> 01:27:08.410
<v Speaker 5>Like I was looking at Zeiss by knows the</v>
<v Speaker 5>other day I read.</v>

1869
01:27:08.810 --> 01:27:10.280
<v Speaker 5>Talked about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>

1870
01:27:10.370 --> 01:27:11.330
<v Speaker 5>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1871
01:27:11.331 --> 01:27:14.720
<v Speaker 5>but then I read a review on them and I</v>
<v Speaker 5>actually googled them,</v>

1872
01:27:14.840 --> 01:27:17.810
<v Speaker 5>but then like everywhere I went,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if I went online,</v>

1873
01:27:17.811 --> 01:27:20.240
<v Speaker 5>I would see a little google ad for Zeiss</v>
<v Speaker 5>by knows.</v>

1874
01:27:20.241 --> 01:27:21.590
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is kind of creepy,</v>

1875
01:27:21.620 --> 01:27:24.320
<v Speaker 5>but that's different.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think if you google search it,</v>

1876
01:27:24.350 --> 01:27:26.030
<v Speaker 5>you're on the grid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You are.</v>

1877
01:27:26.660 --> 01:27:30.440
<v Speaker 5>If you're on someone else's device in</v>
<v Speaker 5>your home kitchen,</v>

1878
01:27:31.460 --> 01:27:33.920
<v Speaker 5>it's not like I was looking at it on</v>
<v Speaker 5>mine.</v>

1879
01:27:33.980 --> 01:27:37.550
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was on Sharon's Ipad then,</v>

1880
01:27:37.670 --> 01:27:41.630
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she was ordering me a ring on her ipad</v>

1881
01:27:41.631 --> 01:27:46.631
<v Speaker 5>and we were talking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then I opened my instagram up and hears</v>

1882
01:27:46.850 --> 01:27:51.850
<v Speaker 5>the silicone rings as a sponsored</v>
<v Speaker 5>recommendation within my instagram feed.</v>

1883
01:27:57.380 --> 01:27:58.140
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 5>You gotta back it up,</v>

1885
01:28:01.021 --> 01:28:01.970
<v Speaker 5>back it up.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Go back to that.</v>

1887

<v Speaker 5>These are all free services we're using</v>

1888
01:28:07.110 --> 01:28:09.630

<v Speaker 5>so you have to give up a little bit to</v>

<v Speaker 4>I'm glad you stay away from this.</v>

1908
01:29:18.090 --> 01:29:20.810
<v Speaker 4>This is a bad drug.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is the God that this is a drug that</v>

1909
01:29:20.811 --> 01:29:22.010
<v Speaker 4>government doesn't approve of.</v>

1910
01:29:23.220 --> 01:29:27.030
<v Speaker 7>California does.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Jeff sessions was in town today.</v>

1911
01:29:27.680 --> 01:29:29.850
<v Speaker 7>Kick grief.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Who's telling people?</v>

1912
01:29:31.050 --> 01:29:36.050
<v Speaker 7>Stop letting Mexicans are watching this.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's actually five feet away from me,</v>

1913
01:29:36.121 --> 01:29:41.121
<v Speaker 7>but it looked like a fog machine and</v>
<v Speaker 7>Hollywood right there.</v>

1914
01:29:41.880 --> 01:29:43.350
<v Speaker 7>Like some horror movie.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1915
01:29:44.850 --> 01:29:45.950
<v Speaker 7>Do you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

1916
01:29:46.560 --> 01:29:50.400
<v Speaker 7>remember when I talked,</v>
<v Speaker 7>have you ever listen to my podcast with</v>

1917
01:29:50.460 --> 01:29:52.800
<v Speaker 7>Mike's linkerd with hex?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yes.</v>

1918
01:29:53.670 --> 01:29:55.380
<v Speaker 7>I've listened to every podcast you've</v>
<v Speaker 7>ever done.</v>

1919
01:29:55.890 --> 01:29:57.720
<v Speaker 7>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Knock on.tv.</v>

1920
01:29:59.330 --> 01:30:00.770
<v Speaker 7>That's not done.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Not Gone.</v>

1921
01:30:00.780 --> 01:30:01.980
<v Speaker 7>Podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1922
01:30:02.040 --> 01:30:03.240
<v Speaker 7>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

1923
01:30:03.540 --> 01:30:07.380
<v Speaker 7>Mike actually went to Dr. McGee.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Did he?</v>

1924
01:30:07.440 --> 01:30:11.310
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he couldn't pull his boat for almost a</v>

1925
01:30:11.310 --> 01:30:15.420
<v Speaker 7>year because he had so many problems in</v>
<v Speaker 7>the shoulder and he was really dreading</v>

1926
01:30:16.050 --> 01:30:20.340
<v Speaker 7>the surgery because he was worried about</v>
<v Speaker 7>his downtime and I told him like,</v>

1927
01:30:20.341 --> 01:30:25.140
<v Speaker 7>man,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you need to to call Rati because there's</v>

1928
01:30:25.141 --> 01:30:29.160
<v Speaker 7>a possibility you don't need the knife.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And so he went down there and he ended</v>

1929
01:30:29.161 --> 01:30:33.780
<v Speaker 7>up getting in an injection I think in</v>
<v Speaker 7>September or October,</v>

1930
01:30:34.410 --> 01:30:39.060
<v Speaker 7>and then he came hunting with me in</v>
<v Speaker 7>November and we actually shot together</v>

1931
01:30:39.061 --> 01:30:41.250
<v Speaker 7>and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 7>this is the first time I've been able to</v>

1932
01:30:41.251 --> 01:30:43.890
<v Speaker 7>shoot my boat in a long,</v>
<v Speaker 7>long time.</v>

1933
01:30:44.040 --> 01:30:45.600
<v Speaker 7>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Wow,</v>

1934
01:30:47.220 --> 01:30:48.053
<v Speaker 7>that's amazing.</v>

1935
01:30:48.550 --> 01:30:51.340
<v Speaker 4>It's just so cool that there's something</v>
<v Speaker 4>like that out there for people and</v>

1936
01:30:51.341 --> 01:30:52.930
<v Speaker 4>there's a bunch of different versions of</v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

1937
01:30:53.140 --> 01:30:56.170
<v Speaker 4>I know people that have had really good</v>
<v Speaker 4>results where some places they take the</v>

1938
01:30:56.171 --> 01:30:59.590
<v Speaker 4>stem cells out of your fat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They like to give you a little baby</v>

1939
01:30:59.591 --> 01:31:01.870
<v Speaker 4>liposuction,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pull some fat out,</v>

1940
01:31:01.930 --> 01:31:04.000
<v Speaker 4>take the stem cells,</v>
<v Speaker 4>mix it up,</v>

1941
01:31:04.001 --> 01:31:06.580
<v Speaker 4>shoot it into joints.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People who had real positive results</v>

1942
01:31:06.581 --> 01:31:09.190
<v Speaker 4>with that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's weird that we ha we did it the way</v>

1943
01:31:09.191 --> 01:31:12.520
<v Speaker 4>we did it with the blood,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then there's also the out of the</v>

1944
01:31:12.521 --> 01:31:15.610
<v Speaker 4>bone marrow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is supposed to be more painful.</v>

1945
01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.490
<v Speaker 4>It's supposed to be more painful,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's also supposed to be really</v>

1946
01:31:18.491 --> 01:31:19.440
<v Speaker 4>effective.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ah,</v>

1947
01:31:19.480 --> 01:31:22.660
<v Speaker 4>Daniel Cormier had that done.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He had real good results with that.</v>

1948
01:31:22.900 --> 01:31:26.000
<v Speaker 4>He had that done with a knee injury and</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1949
01:31:26.170 --> 01:31:29.060
<v Speaker 4>he was concerned like I think I believe</v>
<v Speaker 4>on,</v>

1950
01:31:29.061 --> 01:31:30.100
<v Speaker 4>on to speak out of school.</v>

1951
01:31:30.100 --> 01:31:35.100
<v Speaker 4>I'm pretty sure it was an MCL wasn't um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the big one.</v>

1952
01:31:35.860 --> 01:31:38.500
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't the acl.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The acl is the big one.</v>

1953
01:31:38.770 --> 01:31:41.260
<v Speaker 4>That's a tough one because that's the</v>
<v Speaker 4>stabilizer one.</v>

1954
01:31:41.261 --> 01:31:43.030
<v Speaker 4>That's the one that goes through the</v>
<v Speaker 4>center of the knee.</v>

1955
01:31:43.210 --> 01:31:45.640
<v Speaker 4>I blown,</v>
<v Speaker 4>blown both of those out heavy.</v>

1956
01:31:45.641 --> 01:31:47.460
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1957
01:31:47.490 --> 01:31:49.030
<v Speaker 4>Even both cut on or,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1958
01:31:49.031 --> 01:31:52.000
<v Speaker 4>both of them reconstructed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1959
01:31:52.001 --> 01:31:56.680
<v Speaker 4>The first one I had done where they take</v>
<v Speaker 4>a chunk of your patella tendon with a</v>

1960
01:31:56.681 --> 01:32:00.460
<v Speaker 4>piece of your knee cap and a piece of</v>
<v Speaker 4>your Shin and they open you up like a</v>

1961
01:32:00.461 --> 01:32:03.400
<v Speaker 4>trout and they fucking screw that baby</v>
<v Speaker 4>in.</v>

1962
01:32:03.490 --> 01:32:06.160
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if I've ever seen the front</v>
<v Speaker 4>of your knee cap.</v>

1963
01:32:06.220 --> 01:32:07.090
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can see it.</v>

1964
01:32:07.091 --> 01:32:08.890
<v Speaker 4>There's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a big cut.</v>

1965
01:32:08.891 --> 01:32:13.891
<v Speaker 4>Normally get those barbell jeans up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These are by the Belgians minor to also</v>

1966
01:32:14.921 --> 01:32:17.200
<v Speaker 4>not a sponsor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can kind of see they're awesome</v>

1967
01:32:17.201 --> 01:32:18.034
<v Speaker 4>guys.</v>

1968
01:32:18.280 --> 01:32:19.600
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a great product.</v>

1969
01:32:19.870 --> 01:32:23.590
<v Speaker 4>There's calf out there that I'm not</v>
<v Speaker 4>flexing and that's just what my calf,</v>

1970
01:32:23.591 --> 01:32:25.030
<v Speaker 4>I am,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not,</v>

1971
01:32:25.300 --> 01:32:27.310
<v Speaker 4>I am,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have large your flex.</v>

1972
01:32:27.510 --> 01:32:29.400
<v Speaker 4>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm the rock.</v>

1973
01:32:29.410 --> 01:32:30.250
<v Speaker 4>I'm not at all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>

1974
01:32:30.400 --> 01:32:31.760
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>see,</v>

1975
01:32:32.110 --> 01:32:34.070
<v Speaker 4>I'm losing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm very loose.</v>

1976
01:32:34.110 --> 01:32:35.090
<v Speaker 4>Flicks him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1977
01:32:35.130 --> 01:32:37.510
<v Speaker 4>so I wanna look cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is great now,</v>

1978
01:32:37.511 --> 01:32:39.580
<v Speaker 4>but it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was in pain for a year.</v>

1979
01:32:39.790 --> 01:32:42.920
<v Speaker 4>A solid year.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I couldn't kneel net,</v>

1980
01:32:42.921 --> 01:32:44.560
<v Speaker 4>no kneeling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was no kneeling going on.</v>

1981
01:32:44.890 --> 01:32:47.020
<v Speaker 4>If I had to suck Dick,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd be in real trouble.</v>

1982
01:32:47.260 --> 01:32:49.630
<v Speaker 4>I have to lie on the bed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let it do not my face.</v>

1983
01:32:49.990 --> 01:32:54.370
<v Speaker 4>There was no way I'd be able to say</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the alcohol talking.</v>

1984
01:32:55.630 --> 01:32:57.280
<v Speaker 4>The point is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was painful.</v>

1985
01:32:57.580 --> 01:33:01.960
<v Speaker 4>But the other one that I had done a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had it done with a another planet.</v>

1986
01:33:02.410 --> 01:33:04.930
<v Speaker 4>I had it done with a cadaver and that</v>
<v Speaker 4>way,</v>

1987
01:33:05.080 --> 01:33:05.620
<v Speaker 4>way easier.</v>

1988
01:33:05.620 --> 01:33:07.060
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was ways you're in,</v>

1989
01:33:07.061 --> 01:33:09.370
<v Speaker 4>but way weirder because you're thinking</v>
<v Speaker 4>about it.</v>

1990
01:33:09.371 --> 01:33:11.980
<v Speaker 4>You get some dead person's parts in your</v>
<v Speaker 4>body.</v>

1991
01:33:12.550 --> 01:33:13.960
<v Speaker 4>My father,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1992
01:33:14.200 --> 01:33:19.200
<v Speaker 4>I shouldn't say that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sharon stepdad has a pig heart and he's</v>

1993
01:33:19.870 --> 01:33:21.760
<v Speaker 4>pretty proud of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

1994
01:33:21.761 --> 01:33:26.761
<v Speaker 4>He has a pig heart grew it in a pig.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What you mean it's a pig heart like it's</v>

1995
01:33:27.311 --> 01:33:28.210
<v Speaker 4>his,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1996
01:33:28.211 --> 01:33:30.810
<v Speaker 4>they used a pig valve in his heart.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1997
01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.430
<v Speaker 4>They can't do that with a whole heart.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think so.</v>

1998
01:33:33.640 --> 01:33:34.930
<v Speaker 4>But they can do with parts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1999
01:33:34.931 --> 01:33:39.550
<v Speaker 4>Pigs are super similar apparently to</v>
<v Speaker 4>people with certain organs to the point</v>

2000
01:33:39.551 --> 01:33:42.220
<v Speaker 4>where they think that there might be a</v>
<v Speaker 4>time where we,</v>

2001
01:33:42.280 --> 01:33:45.220
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>use genetic engineering to manipulate a</v>

2002
01:33:45.221 --> 01:33:49.060
<v Speaker 4>pig to grow a human body.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Parts what?</v>

2003
01:33:49.510 --> 01:33:50.440
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're real,</v>

2004
01:33:50.470 --> 01:33:55.470
<v Speaker 4>they're real close apparently to</v>
<v Speaker 4>figuring out a way to combine human.</v>

2005
01:33:56.880 --> 01:34:01.660
<v Speaker 4>They're scientists grow bullish on paid</v>
<v Speaker 4>to human transplants.</v>

2006
01:34:02.050 --> 01:34:03.960
<v Speaker 4>Jamie just pulled up an article.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's Baltimore.</v>

2007
01:34:04.310 --> 01:34:07.840
<v Speaker 4>It's the website</v>
<v Speaker 4>science mag.org.</v>

2008
01:34:08.320 --> 01:34:10.750
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is something that they've apparent.</v>

2009
01:34:10.780 --> 01:34:14.680
<v Speaker 4>There's apparently enough similarity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is coming from a dummy,</v>

2010
01:34:14.710 --> 01:34:18.130
<v Speaker 4>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>settle down enough similarity between</v>

2011
01:34:18.131 --> 01:34:20.980
<v Speaker 4>pigs and humans that we might be able to</v>
<v Speaker 4>grow their organs,</v>

2012
01:34:21.820 --> 01:34:26.210
<v Speaker 4>grow our organs rather inside of them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so like if you need to,</v>

2013
01:34:26.350 --> 01:34:31.020
<v Speaker 4>if he needed a new liver or a kidney or</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you needed maybe even a heart,</v>

2014
01:34:31.270 --> 01:34:36.270
<v Speaker 4>something they could possibly grow it</v>
<v Speaker 4>inside of this genetically altered pig</v>

2015
01:34:38.410 --> 01:34:39.790
<v Speaker 4>cause they're really close to us.</v>

2016
01:34:42.420 --> 01:34:43.600
<v Speaker 4>It's Freaky Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

2017
01:34:43.660 --> 01:34:46.510
<v Speaker 4>It's definitely freaky.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's freaky shit because,</v>

2018
01:34:47.100 --> 01:34:49.780
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the things that I've gotten more</v>

2019
01:34:49.781 --> 01:34:52.420
<v Speaker 4>and more adamant about from,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2020
01:34:52.450 --> 01:34:55.940
<v Speaker 4>being around wild animals,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2021
01:34:55.960 --> 01:34:59.240
<v Speaker 4>is that that's really the only way</v>
<v Speaker 4>animals should be.</v>

2022
01:34:59.630 --> 01:35:01.760
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's one thing like your dog like</v>

2023
01:35:01.761 --> 01:35:02.910
<v Speaker 4>shades.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>

2024
01:35:03.020 --> 01:35:05.600
<v Speaker 4>I don't want the shades to be wild.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's a sweetie.</v>

2025
01:35:05.660 --> 01:35:07.400
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

2026
01:35:07.580 --> 01:35:09.470
<v Speaker 4>She wouldn't make it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a different thing.</v>

2027
01:35:09.500 --> 01:35:13.160
<v Speaker 4>She wouldn't make it different thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Pat is a different thing and anybody</v>

2028
01:35:13.161 --> 01:35:15.110
<v Speaker 4>thinks to start a different,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a family member.</v>

2029
01:35:15.610 --> 01:35:17.630
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my pets are family members,</v>

2030
01:35:17.660 --> 01:35:18.670
<v Speaker 4>my dog,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my,</v>

2031
01:35:19.280 --> 01:35:20.500
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if,</v>

2032
01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:24.350
<v Speaker 4>if I have an interaction with a dog,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like I love them.</v>

2033
01:35:24.880 --> 01:35:26.990
<v Speaker 4>And this is not the same as,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2034
01:35:27.530 --> 01:35:32.530
<v Speaker 4>the way I feel about</v>
<v Speaker 4>a wild thing.</v>

2035
01:35:33.200 --> 01:35:35.270
<v Speaker 4>Wild thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to be wild.</v>

2036
01:35:36.120 --> 01:35:40.130
<v Speaker 4>Really want them to be wild because I</v>
<v Speaker 4>just think that we fucked up.</v>

2037
01:35:40.550 --> 01:35:45.550
<v Speaker 4>We got real comfortable with this way of</v>
<v Speaker 4>a raising and treating life outside of</v>

2038
01:35:49.191 --> 01:35:51.500
<v Speaker 4>our own species.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even her own,</v>

2039
01:35:52.070 --> 01:35:53.390
<v Speaker 4>she would argue.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>

2040
01:35:53.570 --> 01:35:54.650
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you'd be right.</v>

2041
01:35:55.660 --> 01:35:57.710
<v Speaker 4>You've been around.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even her own has been,</v>

2042
01:35:57.800 --> 01:36:02.090
<v Speaker 4>I think the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think the whole picture is completely</v>

2043
01:36:02.091 --> 01:36:04.100
<v Speaker 4>different now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People won't get it.</v>

2044
01:36:04.730 --> 01:36:09.730
<v Speaker 4>I mean we want our,</v>
<v Speaker 4>our pet dog to be part of our family,</v>

2045
01:36:11.030 --> 01:36:15.110
<v Speaker 4>but the reality is if they were</v>
<v Speaker 4>legitimately out there in the wild,</v>

2046
01:36:15.111 --> 01:36:20.111
<v Speaker 4>they would be dead quick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My kids got rabbits,</v>

2047
01:36:20.510 --> 01:36:22.820
<v Speaker 4>they're useless.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't give a fuck about these</v>

2048
01:36:22.821 --> 01:36:26.840
<v Speaker 4>rabbits,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which we talked about this in favor like</v>

2049
01:36:26.841 --> 01:36:29.090
<v Speaker 4>we have to give rabbits,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but okay,</v>

2050
01:36:29.240 --> 01:36:30.890
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'll get rabbits.</v>

2051
01:36:30.891 --> 01:36:32.660
<v Speaker 4>They don't give a fuck about those</v>
<v Speaker 4>rabbits.</v>

2052
01:36:32.661 --> 01:36:35.180
<v Speaker 4>They go like a week without even looking</v>
<v Speaker 4>at those things.</v>

2053
01:36:35.510 --> 01:36:38.630
<v Speaker 4>They just don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the rabbit stay chill with the</v>

2054
01:36:38.631 --> 01:36:39.800
<v Speaker 4>chickens in the chicken coop.</v>

2055
01:36:39.830 --> 01:36:42.170
<v Speaker 4>So everybody's good rabbit's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're having a good old time.</v>

2056
01:36:42.270 --> 01:36:44.960
<v Speaker 4>They're selfish too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here's the thing,</v>

2057
01:36:45.320 --> 01:36:49.850
<v Speaker 4>what rabbit is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is a small prey animal that has to</v>

2058
01:36:49.851 --> 01:36:52.430
<v Speaker 4>dapped its environment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if its environment,</v>

2059
01:36:52.431 --> 01:36:55.610
<v Speaker 4>it's just them being outside by</v>
<v Speaker 4>themselves all the time.</v>

2060
01:36:55.760 --> 01:36:57.860
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as you expected them to be domesticated,</v>

2061
01:36:58.040 --> 01:37:00.950
<v Speaker 4>they're basically wild in the cage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2062
01:37:01.040 --> 01:37:03.530
<v Speaker 4>they're not constantly getting direct</v>
<v Speaker 4>contact with people,</v>

2063
01:37:03.560 --> 01:37:06.530
<v Speaker 4>but don't you think some people could be</v>
<v Speaker 4>argued the same?</v>

2064
01:37:06.830 --> 01:37:08.480
<v Speaker 4>You have for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but a button.</v>

2065
01:37:08.481 --> 01:37:11.300
<v Speaker 4>But he was the one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I haven't let you see this yet.</v>

2066
01:37:11.800 --> 01:37:15.350
<v Speaker 4>I'll let you finish your point.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is just such a difference between</v>

2067
01:37:15.351 --> 01:37:19.250
<v Speaker 4>them and a dog.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like the idea of that a rabbit interacts</v>

2068
01:37:19.251 --> 01:37:21.950
<v Speaker 4>with you with the way it fucking dog</v>
<v Speaker 4>does is bananas.</v>

2069
01:37:22.160 --> 01:37:25.580
<v Speaker 4>You're losing me if you don't tell me</v>
<v Speaker 4>you like dogs more than you like</v>

2070
01:37:25.581 --> 01:37:28.940
<v Speaker 4>rabbits.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't talk to you because I've got</v>

2071
01:37:28.941 --> 01:37:31.130
<v Speaker 4>dogs that are like little people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All right.</v>

2072
01:37:31.190 --> 01:37:33.380
<v Speaker 4>I mean they're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're like when my friends like</v>

2073
01:37:33.381 --> 01:37:34.550
<v Speaker 4>Marshall's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my friend,</v>

2074
01:37:35.030 --> 01:37:38.300
<v Speaker 4>he's a one year old friend that I have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have one friend who's one years old.</v>

2075
01:37:38.930 --> 01:37:43.590
<v Speaker 4>This dude and he's literally your best</v>
<v Speaker 4>friend and he,</v>

2076
01:37:43.760 --> 01:37:48.470
<v Speaker 4>there's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do nothing separating you from his best</v>

2077
01:37:48.471 --> 01:37:49.450
<v Speaker 4>friend.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2078
01:37:49.451 --> 01:37:50.990
<v Speaker 4>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're super tight.</v>

2079
01:37:51.050 --> 01:37:53.180
<v Speaker 4>We're like this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>As long as he doesn't steal food off the</v>

2080
01:37:53.181 --> 01:37:54.980
<v Speaker 4>table,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which she will if I'm not looking.</v>

2081
01:37:55.080 --> 01:37:56.100
<v Speaker 4>That's your side</v>

2082
01:37:56.100 --> 01:38:00.390
<v Speaker 2>to his side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's 100% dedicated unit.</v>

2083
01:38:00.480 --> 01:38:04.470
<v Speaker 2>Even if you stoled food from his side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would still be your best friend the</v>

2084
01:38:04.470 --> 01:38:06.800
<v Speaker 2>next day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>100% he's just gotta know the rules can</v>

2085
01:38:06.810 --> 01:38:10.440
<v Speaker 2>be stealing food,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can be climbing on the table and he</v>

2086
01:38:10.441 --> 01:38:13.920
<v Speaker 2>fucking savage like dogs would just jump</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the table and just,</v>

2087
01:38:14.090 --> 01:38:17.190
<v Speaker 2>you don't realize how like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh that's a course.</v>

2088
01:38:17.191 --> 01:38:19.050
<v Speaker 2>That's is the food is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why would he jump up there?</v>

2089
01:38:19.051 --> 01:38:22.230
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing you've been able to stop</v>
<v Speaker 2>him from jumping up there.</v>

2090
01:38:22.231 --> 01:38:24.810
<v Speaker 2>The moment he gets in the room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what's really amazing.</v>

2091
01:38:24.840 --> 01:38:28.500
<v Speaker 2>Here's what's crazy though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If people had to really go out in the</v>

2092
01:38:28.501 --> 01:38:33.480
<v Speaker 2>world and defend them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fen defend themselves like our dogs</v>

2093
01:38:33.481 --> 01:38:36.000
<v Speaker 2>would that are technically family</v>
<v Speaker 2>members,</v>

2094
01:38:37.500 --> 01:38:40.620
<v Speaker 2>there would be a very clear line drawn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

2095
01:38:40.621 --> 01:38:42.600
<v Speaker 2>but they don't and that's why we're</v>
<v Speaker 2>delusional.</v>

2096
01:38:42.601 --> 01:38:45.840
<v Speaker 2>And then there's movies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Disney movies,</v>

2097
01:38:45.841 --> 01:38:47.910
<v Speaker 2>Bambi,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all that crazy shit.</v>

2098
01:38:47.910 --> 01:38:51.120
<v Speaker 2>Yogi and booboo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But Molly's that rabbit movie.</v>

2099
01:38:51.350 --> 01:38:53.790
<v Speaker 2>Cause when we got on this subject,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most recent one?</v>

2100
01:38:53.791 --> 01:38:56.730
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sharon brought up that movie that was</v>

2101
01:38:56.731 --> 01:38:59.910
<v Speaker 2>like the darkest kids movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does it ted?</v>

2102
01:39:00.210 --> 01:39:01.043
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

2103
01:39:01.080 --> 01:39:03.660
<v Speaker 2>it was a rabbit movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rabbit movie.</v>

2104
01:39:04.290 --> 01:39:05.880
<v Speaker 2>What was the name of it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look it up,</v>

2105
01:39:05.881 --> 01:39:07.290
<v Speaker 2>Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>

2106
01:39:07.470 --> 01:39:10.080
<v Speaker 2>it was considered one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

2107
01:39:10.081 --> 01:39:14.070
<v Speaker 2>one of the darkest kids movies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was where it was all about rabbits</v>

2108
01:39:14.100 --> 01:39:15.680
<v Speaker 2>and I'm trying to think of the name of</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

2109
01:39:15.681 --> 01:39:17.430
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know what that is.</v>

2110
01:39:18.730 --> 01:39:21.750
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a youtube video showing pretty</v>

2111
01:39:21.751 --> 01:39:24.480
<v Speaker 2>much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like a highlight reel of that</v>

2112
01:39:24.481 --> 01:39:29.250
<v Speaker 2>movie and it was too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think a mirror inland Manson song and</v>

2113
01:39:29.251 --> 01:39:32.610
<v Speaker 2>it was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was pretty dark.</v>

2114
01:39:32.640 --> 01:39:36.720
<v Speaker 2>I think it was called bright eyes or</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe that was the theme song to the</v>

2115
01:39:36.721 --> 01:39:37.554
<v Speaker 2>movie.</v>

2116
01:39:38.190 --> 01:39:40.530
<v Speaker 2>Bright Eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A dark rabbit.</v>

2117
01:39:40.531 --> 01:39:41.620
<v Speaker 2>Mophie dumb,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dumb,</v>

2118
01:39:41.660 --> 01:39:43.980
<v Speaker 2>dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Seriously.</v>

2119
01:39:44.040 --> 01:39:47.550
<v Speaker 2>You need to look that up on Youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Little by a right eyes.</v>

2120
01:39:47.730 --> 01:39:50.520
<v Speaker 2>Imagine fuck bigfoot Matt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just seven foot rabbit.</v>

2121
01:39:50.760 --> 01:39:52.980
<v Speaker 2>I tries to bite your head off with those</v>
<v Speaker 2>giant teeth.</v>

2122
01:39:53.310 --> 01:39:55.170
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seven foot rabbit.</v>

2123
01:39:55.290 --> 01:39:57.750
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if I'd be that terrified,</v>
<v Speaker 2>terrified.</v>

2124
01:39:57.751 --> 01:40:00.810
<v Speaker 2>Seven foot Grizzly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd be way more terrifying.</v>

2125
01:40:00.811 --> 01:40:03.660
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Seven foot crocodile way more terrified.</v>

2126
01:40:03.670 --> 01:40:05.350
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Komodo Dragon.</v>

2127
01:40:05.351 --> 01:40:08.340
<v Speaker 2>Did you find it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does leadership down?</v>

2128
01:40:08.341 --> 01:40:10.260
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

2129
01:40:11.220 --> 01:40:15.330
<v Speaker 2>Pressing rabbit moving it is to die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember this,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

2131
01:40:18.270 --> 01:40:20.760
<v Speaker 2>Watershed Cam trailer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If we play it,</v>

2132
01:40:20.761 --> 01:40:24.030
<v Speaker 2>we'll get yanked off of youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But can you play that?</v>

2133
01:40:24.031 --> 01:40:27.000
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can't play any clips today.</v>

2134
01:40:27.001 --> 01:40:28.710
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's going on?</v>

2135
01:40:28.711 --> 01:40:29.760
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after the hold up,</v>

2136
01:40:30.380 --> 01:40:31.460
<v Speaker 2>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go ahead and take a,</v>

2137
01:40:31.710 --> 01:40:33.840
<v Speaker 2>take a leak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey Jamie,</v>

2138
01:40:34.500 --> 01:40:39.000
<v Speaker 2>that while we're talking about</v>
<v Speaker 2>alligators or crocodiles,</v>

2139
01:40:39.001 --> 01:40:41.010
<v Speaker 2>you gotta see this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is actually,</v>

2140
01:40:41.011 --> 01:40:44.430
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the guys that dragons,</v>

2141
01:40:44.431 --> 01:40:47.190
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a new short film coming up.</v>

2142
01:40:47.220 --> 01:40:52.220
<v Speaker 2>This is one of the guys that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he documents wildlife,</v>

2143
01:40:53.740 --> 01:40:54.573
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2144
01:40:54.780 --> 01:40:58.420
<v Speaker 1>that mouth and he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a hex advocate,</v>

2145
01:40:58.421 --> 01:41:01.630
<v Speaker 1>but he wasn't a hex advocate first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a,</v>

2146
01:41:01.960 --> 01:41:04.390
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's explain what hexis you can explain</v>

2147
01:41:04.391 --> 01:41:08.320
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A hecs rather is a,</v>

2148
01:41:08.770 --> 01:41:13.770
<v Speaker 1>it's a company that makes um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these suits that apparently the idea is</v>

2149
01:41:14.141 --> 01:41:19.141
<v Speaker 1>that they block and electro magnetic</v>
<v Speaker 1>frequency that people admit is that I</v>

2150
01:41:20.110 --> 01:41:20.831
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2151
01:41:20.831 --> 01:41:25.831
<v Speaker 1>you're good and electromagnetic current.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something body emits that they</v>

2152
01:41:27.461 --> 01:41:30.790
<v Speaker 1>think John Dudley has left the room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has to pee.</v>

2153
01:41:31.840 --> 01:41:34.180
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the,</v>

2154
01:41:34.510 --> 01:41:37.450
<v Speaker 1>the most honest way I can say this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2155
01:41:37.720 --> 01:41:42.720
<v Speaker 1>John is a big believer in this heck</v>
<v Speaker 1>system and I don't know if it works but</v>

2156
01:41:44.891 --> 01:41:49.780
<v Speaker 1>I know a lot of people think it works</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there is a task that they use where</v>

2157
01:41:49.781 --> 01:41:52.240
<v Speaker 1>there's a machine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see if he could find,</v>

2158
01:41:52.270 --> 01:41:54.970
<v Speaker 1>they have a video of him explaining how</v>
<v Speaker 1>it works.</v>

2159
01:41:55.090 --> 01:41:57.080
<v Speaker 1>And in the video it says it in there.</v>

2160
01:41:57.080 --> 01:41:59.020
<v Speaker 1>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the website there's a video link.</v>

2161
01:41:59.080 --> 01:42:01.570
<v Speaker 1>See the video link?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2162
01:42:02.140 --> 01:42:04.000
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see where it says videos.</v>

2163
01:42:04.060 --> 01:42:04.960
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>third from the,</v>

2164
01:42:04.961 --> 01:42:06.200
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is um,</v>

2165
01:42:06.250 --> 01:42:11.250
<v Speaker 1>there's something where they show the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can swipe their arm over some sort</v>

2166
01:42:11.411 --> 01:42:16.411
<v Speaker 1>of a machine that is designed to detect</v>
<v Speaker 1>electrical current that comes from your</v>

2167
01:42:17.651 --> 01:42:20.830
<v Speaker 1>body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they do it with just a normal arm</v>

2168
01:42:20.831 --> 01:42:24.910
<v Speaker 1>with like a shirt on and then they do it</v>
<v Speaker 1>with this heck suit on and the heck suit</v>

2169
01:42:25.360 --> 01:42:30.360
<v Speaker 1>it blocks whatever that frequency is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the idea is that we're assuming</v>

2170
01:42:30.611 --> 01:42:35.611
<v Speaker 1>that somehow or another the animals</v>
<v Speaker 1>might have some sort of method of</v>

2171
01:42:36.431 --> 01:42:39.880
<v Speaker 1>detection by way of the actual</v>
<v Speaker 1>electrical energy that's come from a</v>

2172
01:42:39.881 --> 01:42:42.190
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do I know if that's correct?</v>

2173
01:42:42.191 --> 01:42:44.530
<v Speaker 1>I do not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do not know if that's correct.</v>

2174
01:42:44.770 --> 01:42:49.630
<v Speaker 1>It's fascinating to think of though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I wonder how many different</v>

2175
01:42:49.631 --> 01:42:54.631
<v Speaker 1>animals have this interesting sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>ability to detect things other than just</v>

2176
01:42:56.951 --> 01:42:58.210
<v Speaker 1>smelling and seeing.</v>

2177
01:42:58.420 --> 01:43:03.010
<v Speaker 1>Like maybe there's a feel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe they have a feel and apparently</v>

2178
01:43:03.011 --> 01:43:06.490
<v Speaker 1>these things are particularly effective</v>
<v Speaker 1>with predators,</v>

2179
01:43:07.510 --> 01:43:10.420
<v Speaker 1>which kind of makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess that predators would,</v>

2180
01:43:10.421 --> 01:43:15.421
<v Speaker 1>it would feel the electrical frequency</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's coming from a UN nervous scared</v>

2181
01:43:17.051 --> 01:43:19.300
<v Speaker 1>animal or something he's trying to run</v>
<v Speaker 1>from it.</v>

2182
01:43:19.810 --> 01:43:22.240
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these things are really effective</v>

2183
01:43:22.241 --> 01:43:26.200
<v Speaker 1>apparently with coyotes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is this documentary or this</v>

2184
01:43:26.201 --> 01:43:27.610
<v Speaker 1>little short film rather,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2185
01:43:27.730 --> 01:43:29.830
<v Speaker 1>dances,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dancing with dragons.</v>

2186
01:43:30.490 --> 01:43:32.860
<v Speaker 1>Perfect timing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just explained hacks to a t.</v>

2187
01:43:33.940 --> 01:43:37.150
<v Speaker 1>I'm a wizard without knowing shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>barely got through high school.</v>

2188
01:43:37.450 --> 01:43:38.400
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2189
01:43:38.980 --> 01:43:41.710
<v Speaker 1>so apparently this signal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever the,</v>

2190
01:43:41.711 --> 01:43:44.980
<v Speaker 1>the human signal is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that the fact that they can</v>

2191
01:43:44.981 --> 01:43:48.490
<v Speaker 1>detect it in this machine and I've</v>
<v Speaker 1>watched that detection,</v>

2192
01:43:48.491 --> 01:43:49.720
<v Speaker 1>it's real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's legitimate.</v>

2193
01:43:49.721 --> 01:43:52.370
<v Speaker 1>So something's happening that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>machine detects.</v>

2194
01:43:52.610 --> 01:43:57.560
<v Speaker 1>I think we'd be foolhardy to believe</v>
<v Speaker 1>that animals can't detect that as well.</v>

2195
01:43:57.680 --> 01:44:00.110
<v Speaker 1>Now is that mean that it will work on</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything and no,</v>

2196
01:44:00.111 --> 01:44:01.610
<v Speaker 1>believer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a believer too,</v>

2197
01:44:01.730 --> 01:44:03.080
<v Speaker 1>but this is what I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's,</v>

2198
01:44:03.350 --> 01:44:05.570
<v Speaker 1>there's a whole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's so many factors when it comes to</v>

2199
01:44:05.571 --> 01:44:08.030
<v Speaker 1>getting close to an animal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they have so many senses.</v>

2200
01:44:08.210 --> 01:44:12.050
<v Speaker 1>I think they could smell in some insane</v>
<v Speaker 1>way that we can't even imagine.</v>

2201
01:44:12.140 --> 01:44:14.090
<v Speaker 1>They can hear shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can never here.</v>

2202
01:44:14.630 --> 01:44:17.450
<v Speaker 1>They're just tuned in the idea that that</v>
<v Speaker 1>would be it.</v>

2203
01:44:17.620 --> 01:44:20.210
<v Speaker 1>That they wouldn't have some other shit</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we haven't really thought of.</v>

2204
01:44:20.550 --> 01:44:24.020
<v Speaker 7>This would be a good guest for you.</v>
<v Speaker 7>[inaudible] name is forrest Scullin.</v>

2205
01:44:24.030 --> 01:44:25.800
<v Speaker 7>Tay is actually,</v>
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

2206
01:44:25.890 --> 01:44:30.690
<v Speaker 7>he's got some really cool stuff coming</v>
<v Speaker 7>up that I'm not able to talk about,</v>

2207
01:44:30.720 --> 01:44:34.020
<v Speaker 7>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I know you and now tell me the things</v>

2208
01:44:34.021 --> 01:44:36.810
<v Speaker 7>over.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I know you enough to know that it's in</v>

2209
01:44:36.811 --> 01:44:38.760
<v Speaker 7>your wheelhouse,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but,</v>

2210
01:44:38.761 --> 01:44:42.750
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>this is all a hundred percent wild,</v>

2211
01:44:42.900 --> 01:44:45.150
<v Speaker 7>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't want to say it wrong,</v>

2212
01:44:45.151 --> 01:44:49.150
<v Speaker 7>but I think it's at a certain place down</v>
<v Speaker 7>south of Mexico.</v>

2213
01:44:49.151 --> 01:44:50.200
<v Speaker 7>This,</v>
<v Speaker 7>yeah.</v>

2214
01:44:50.310 --> 01:44:51.540
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>absolutely.</v>

2215
01:44:51.900 --> 01:44:52.733
<v Speaker 7>So this,</v>
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

2216
01:44:52.800 --> 01:44:56.010
<v Speaker 7>he had,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he just had a documentary that came out.</v>

2217
01:44:56.100 --> 01:45:00.540
<v Speaker 7>He's in a document,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he's in a heck suit that actually has a</v>

2218
01:45:00.541 --> 01:45:03.900
<v Speaker 7>pattern that resembles the saltwater</v>
<v Speaker 7>crocodiles.</v>

2219
01:45:04.260 --> 01:45:06.120
<v Speaker 7>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Did you notice that part?</v>

2220
01:45:06.150 --> 01:45:09.030
<v Speaker 7>I did not want,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but I only did once you brought it up,</v>

2221
01:45:09.540 --> 01:45:14.160
<v Speaker 7>I was mimicking,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he's mimicking the behaviors of a</v>

2222
01:45:14.161 --> 01:45:19.161
<v Speaker 7>saltwater croc so that he can literally</v>
<v Speaker 7>be within a few inches of them.</v>

2223
01:45:21.520 --> 01:45:26.140
<v Speaker 1>So did they wa they would probably be</v>
<v Speaker 1>real dangerous to try that even the way</v>

2224
01:45:26.141 --> 01:45:28.450
<v Speaker 1>he did it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But did they try it without the heck</v>

2225
01:45:28.451 --> 01:45:29.890
<v Speaker 1>suit?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like did they try like a,</v>

2226
01:45:29.960 --> 01:45:32.100
<v Speaker 1>like a rash guard that with the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>exact</v>

2227
01:45:32.160 --> 01:45:33.900
<v Speaker 7>pattern on it?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2228
01:45:34.350 --> 01:45:35.183
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There's,</v>

2229
01:45:35.220 --> 01:45:37.800
<v Speaker 7>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there's a lot of really good videos</v>

2230
01:45:37.801 --> 01:45:42.030
<v Speaker 7>showing the difference between how much</v>
<v Speaker 7>interaction you can have with certain</v>

2231
01:45:42.031 --> 01:45:44.070
<v Speaker 7>animals that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>especially ones that have,</v>

2232
01:45:44.180 --> 01:45:48.570
<v Speaker 7>it's scientifically been proven to test</v>
<v Speaker 7>to sense it.</v>

2233
01:45:48.650 --> 01:45:51.570
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So you know,</v>

2234
01:45:51.571 --> 01:45:56.220
<v Speaker 7>in the wildlife community things like</v>
<v Speaker 7>sharks and shark week obviously have a</v>

2235
01:45:56.221 --> 01:46:00.210
<v Speaker 7>huge amount of funding behind it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>A migratory birds,</v>

2236
01:46:00.240 --> 01:46:02.070
<v Speaker 7>same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So all that stuff.</v>

2237
01:46:02.071 --> 01:46:06.600
<v Speaker 7>There's been very good documentation on,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2238
01:46:06.750 --> 01:46:10.260
<v Speaker 7>electromagnetic fields and what animals</v>
<v Speaker 7>can see.</v>

2239
01:46:10.290 --> 01:46:12.570
<v Speaker 7>But when it comes to like the hunting</v>
<v Speaker 7>community,</v>

2240
01:46:12.630 --> 01:46:16.530
<v Speaker 7>obviously there's not a lot of big</v>
<v Speaker 7>funding behind it because it's a much</v>

2241
01:46:16.531 --> 01:46:20.040
<v Speaker 7>smaller community.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But things like this,</v>

2242
01:46:20.041 --> 01:46:23.670
<v Speaker 7>things that are on animal planet or</v>
<v Speaker 7>Discovery Channel,</v>

2243
01:46:23.940 --> 01:46:28.940
<v Speaker 7>I mean these are things that are at I</v>
<v Speaker 7>think a higher level of maybe testing</v>

2244
01:46:30.570 --> 01:46:35.570
<v Speaker 7>versus what we have in the hunting side.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And I just know that me personally as a</v>

2245
01:46:35.611 --> 01:46:38.970
<v Speaker 7>hunter,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I've experienced more like up close</v>

2246
01:46:39.030 --> 01:46:42.810
<v Speaker 7>interaction with it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So I just find some of this stuff</v>

2247
01:46:42.811 --> 01:46:44.100
<v Speaker 7>really,</v>
<v Speaker 7>really cool,</v>

2248
01:46:44.101 --> 01:46:44.160
<v Speaker 7>all</v>

2249
01:46:44.160 --> 01:46:46.930
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's like a placebo effect that you</v>

2250
01:46:46.960 --> 01:46:49.140
<v Speaker 1>may be just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're in a really good spot with really</v>

2251
01:46:49.141 --> 01:46:51.120
<v Speaker 1>good wind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you had a few experiences,</v>

2252
01:46:51.121 --> 01:46:53.130
<v Speaker 1>so you put it together and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what's happening.</v>

2253
01:46:53.580 --> 01:46:54.350
<v Speaker 1>Is it possible?</v>

2254
01:46:54.350 --> 01:46:57.470
<v Speaker 7>It's possible,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but in the same sense,</v>

2255
01:46:57.770 --> 01:47:00.680
<v Speaker 7>I'll leave that up to you.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think it's possible too,</v>

2256
01:47:00.770 --> 01:47:01.790
<v Speaker 7>but I just want,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I brought it up</v>

2257
01:47:01.810 --> 01:47:03.600
<v Speaker 1>because I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's possible,</v>

2258
01:47:03.601 --> 01:47:05.520
<v Speaker 1>but I think people want one or the</v>
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>

2259
01:47:05.550 --> 01:47:08.190
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's also entirely possible</v>

2260
01:47:08.220 --> 01:47:12.300
<v Speaker 1>if there's a machine that can detect</v>
<v Speaker 1>your electrical magnetic frequency or</v>

2261
01:47:12.301 --> 01:47:14.720
<v Speaker 1>whatever the fuck that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When they do it over that machine to</v>

2262
01:47:14.730 --> 01:47:16.660
<v Speaker 1>there is there is and I've seen it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2263
01:47:16.710 --> 01:47:18.750
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what's happening there and why are we</v>

2264
01:47:18.751 --> 01:47:22.170
<v Speaker 1>assuming animals can't see that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Definitely didn't see at night.</v>

2265
01:47:22.200 --> 01:47:23.940
<v Speaker 1>They could see at night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2266
01:47:23.941 --> 01:47:25.740
<v Speaker 1>They do things that we can't do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They smell things.</v>

2267
01:47:25.741 --> 01:47:27.330
<v Speaker 1>We can't smell the hear things we can't</v>
<v Speaker 1>hear.</v>

2268
01:47:27.570 --> 01:47:30.570
<v Speaker 1>We have intuition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would we assume that their intuition</v>

2269
01:47:30.571 --> 01:47:32.850
<v Speaker 1>is not thousands of times sharper than</v>
<v Speaker 1>ours?</v>

2270
01:47:33.090 --> 01:47:35.040
<v Speaker 1>They're running away from fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>crocodiles and shit.</v>

2271
01:47:35.110 --> 01:47:36.490
<v Speaker 7>Do you know that?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

2272
01:47:36.520 --> 01:47:39.580
<v Speaker 7>I know when you did the podcast with</v>
<v Speaker 7>James Hetfield,</v>

2273
01:47:39.581 --> 01:47:44.080
<v Speaker 7>you guys talked about bees a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Do you know that bees when they go to</v>

2274
01:47:44.081 --> 01:47:49.081
<v Speaker 7>and from certain flowers that actually</v>
<v Speaker 7>they leave in an electromagnetic</v>

2275
01:47:51.520 --> 01:47:56.520
<v Speaker 7>signal on that part so that actually</v>
<v Speaker 7>other bees can see that and know that</v>

2276
01:47:58.601 --> 01:48:02.170
<v Speaker 7>something is another b had already been</v>
<v Speaker 7>there to pollinate that area.</v>

2277
01:48:02.200 --> 01:48:05.620
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I've got a video I can show you that</v>

2278
01:48:05.650 --> 01:48:07.570
<v Speaker 7>actually shows that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But um,</v>

2279
01:48:07.780 --> 01:48:10.750
<v Speaker 7>did I ever tell you about my experience</v>
<v Speaker 7>with bees on fear factor?</v>

2280
01:48:11.560 --> 01:48:14.110
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Super Cool.</v>

2281
01:48:14.200 --> 01:48:14.720
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2282
01:48:14.720 --> 01:48:17.060
<v Speaker 1>They got together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this was a crazy moment.</v>

2283
01:48:17.061 --> 01:48:20.000
<v Speaker 1>They had trained be communication</v>
<v Speaker 1>contests.</v>

2284
01:48:20.420 --> 01:48:24.440
<v Speaker 1>These bees of this guy had brought in</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's a beekeeper and then while we were</v>

2285
01:48:24.441 --> 01:48:27.200
<v Speaker 1>doing the stunt on these people and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>put the bees on these people,</v>

2286
01:48:27.410 --> 01:48:32.410
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden this local beehive</v>
<v Speaker 1>emptied out and came to visit and they</v>

2287
01:48:32.421 --> 01:48:34.040
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the bees got together in the middle</v>

2288
01:48:34.041 --> 01:48:37.370
<v Speaker 1>of the sky and talked and we had a sit</v>
<v Speaker 1>down for like a half an hour.</v>

2289
01:48:37.670 --> 01:48:38.750
<v Speaker 1>The guy was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2290
01:48:38.751 --> 01:48:40.420
<v Speaker 1>we're not gonna do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to do that.</v>

2291
01:48:40.430 --> 01:48:42.770
<v Speaker 1>We have to step back and let them work</v>
<v Speaker 1>this out.</v>

2292
01:48:43.130 --> 01:48:48.130
<v Speaker 1>So he just knew.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He knew how like these alien beings</v>

2293
01:48:48.171 --> 01:48:49.460
<v Speaker 1>we're going to communicate with each</v>
<v Speaker 1>other,</v>

2294
01:48:49.700 --> 01:48:51.440
<v Speaker 1>how they're figuring out their life</v>
<v Speaker 1>forms,</v>

2295
01:48:51.441 --> 01:48:52.640
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we're just like,</v>

2296
01:48:52.641 --> 01:48:53.990
<v Speaker 1>oh it's just bs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No it's on,</v>

2297
01:48:54.020 --> 01:48:59.020
<v Speaker 1>it's a little weird life form that can</v>
<v Speaker 1>fly that somehow under the figures out</v>

2298
01:48:59.300 --> 01:49:02.270
<v Speaker 1>they exchange information with these</v>
<v Speaker 1>other weird life forms.</v>

2299
01:49:02.390 --> 01:49:03.680
<v Speaker 1>They realize,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey we don't,</v>

2300
01:49:03.710 --> 01:49:05.690
<v Speaker 1>we didn't ask to be here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not trying to take over your</v>

2301
01:49:05.691 --> 01:49:06.800
<v Speaker 1>community.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just,</v>

2302
01:49:06.830 --> 01:49:08.630
<v Speaker 1>we showed up cause we're doing fear</v>
<v Speaker 1>factor.</v>

2303
01:49:08.890 --> 01:49:12.220
<v Speaker 7>He know the wiggle dance.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The little thing that bees do,</v>

2304
01:49:12.520 --> 01:49:14.080
<v Speaker 7>the wiggle dance,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what is that?</v>

2305
01:49:14.110 --> 01:49:19.110
<v Speaker 7>They say that's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they assume that's that that's actually</v>

2306
01:49:19.271 --> 01:49:24.271
<v Speaker 7>an electromagnetic dance that's done to</v>
<v Speaker 7>where it gives a signal to the other</v>

2307
01:49:25.451 --> 01:49:29.080
<v Speaker 7>bees to where they can actually know</v>
<v Speaker 7>what they're communicating so they can</v>

2308
01:49:29.081 --> 01:49:30.400
<v Speaker 7>say things.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yep.</v>

2309
01:49:31.210 --> 01:49:33.760
<v Speaker 7>Did they know like how complicated the</v>
<v Speaker 7>speech can be?</v>

2310
01:49:34.800 --> 01:49:36.370
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

2311
01:49:36.430 --> 01:49:41.430
<v Speaker 7>obviously if a bee is sitting in a hive</v>
<v Speaker 7>in my Bush out in my front yard and he</v>

2312
01:49:43.001 --> 01:49:48.001
<v Speaker 7>knows to go three blocks down and two</v>
<v Speaker 7>blocks over and get into</v>

2313
01:49:48.190 --> 01:49:51.010
<v Speaker 5>those purple flowers that are in</v>
<v Speaker 5>someone's front yard,</v>

2314
01:49:51.011 --> 01:49:55.290
<v Speaker 5>they must know pretty dang good</v>
<v Speaker 5>too.</v>

2315
01:49:55.330 --> 01:49:57.100
<v Speaker 5>They know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2316
01:49:57.101 --> 01:49:58.250
<v Speaker 5>we just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we just left.</v>

2317
01:49:58.251 --> 01:50:00.730
<v Speaker 5>They had a heck suit on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They probably wouldn't be able to figure</v>

2318
01:50:00.731 --> 01:50:02.170
<v Speaker 5>it out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>be screwed.</v>

2319
01:50:02.530 --> 01:50:04.120
<v Speaker 5>That's an interesting idea,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

2320
01:50:04.121 --> 01:50:06.280
<v Speaker 5>That there is really some sort of</v>
<v Speaker 5>electrical fee.</v>

2321
01:50:06.320 --> 01:50:08.830
<v Speaker 5>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Electrical fields of flowers.</v>

2322
01:50:08.831 --> 01:50:12.340
<v Speaker 5>Jane simulate the sensory hairs of</v>
<v Speaker 5>bumblebees.</v>

2323
01:50:12.490 --> 01:50:14.040
<v Speaker 5>Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>dude.</v>

2324
01:50:15.100 --> 01:50:18.430
<v Speaker 5>Heck seen on a bumblebee.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he's like,</v>

2325
01:50:18.431 --> 01:50:22.750
<v Speaker 5>nothing's getting pollinated.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Listened what that says electrical</v>

2326
01:50:22.751 --> 01:50:27.751
<v Speaker 5>fields of flowers stimulate the sensory</v>
<v Speaker 5>hairs of Bumblebee.</v>

2327
01:50:28.341 --> 01:50:32.620
<v Speaker 5>So their hairs are feeling where the</v>
<v Speaker 5>wind is pulling them.</v>

2328
01:50:32.650 --> 01:50:34.540
<v Speaker 5>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're feeling some sort of electrical</v>

2329
01:50:34.541 --> 01:50:37.100
<v Speaker 5>charge to a certain little,</v>
<v Speaker 5>little green,</v>

2330
01:50:37.110 --> 01:50:41.140
<v Speaker 5>the dance solid fuck man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that is,</v>

2331
01:50:41.290 --> 01:50:43.990
<v Speaker 5>we're just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because they can't send emails,</v>

2332
01:50:44.410 --> 01:50:45.750
<v Speaker 5>they don't do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's really,</v>

2333
01:50:45.790 --> 01:50:49.540
<v Speaker 5>we weave so slept on bays.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're dying off like they're crazy</v>

2334
01:50:49.541 --> 01:50:51.130
<v Speaker 5>because they're super cool.</v>

2335
01:50:51.670 --> 01:50:54.040
<v Speaker 5>These are super,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're super cool.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2337
01:50:55.510 --> 01:50:58.330
<v Speaker 5>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People that don't give a fuck about bees</v>

2338
01:50:58.331 --> 01:51:02.800
<v Speaker 5>like those are like the most hardcore,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the most hardcore radical Republican</v>

2339
01:51:02.801 --> 01:51:03.520
<v Speaker 5>guys.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All right,</v>

2340
01:51:03.520 --> 01:51:05.980
<v Speaker 5>we'll figure out mechanical piece.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Don't worry about it.</v>

2341
01:51:06.910 --> 01:51:09.360
<v Speaker 5>There was a black mirror,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just people that are like that.</v>

2342
01:51:09.370 --> 01:51:11.860
<v Speaker 5>Man.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Did you watch the dog one with the robot</v>
<v Speaker 5>dogs?</v>

<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we watched them.</v>

2346

<v Speaker 5>It was a fucking terrifying show,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2347
01:51:22.710 --> 01:51:23.560
<v Speaker 5>Cause you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

2348
01:51:23.561 --> 01:51:24.610
<v Speaker 5>this is all like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

2349
01:51:24.611 --> 01:51:27.010
<v Speaker 5>within the realm of possibility,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all of it.</v>

2350
01:51:27.190 --> 01:51:30.490
<v Speaker 5>It's almost like a warning show.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like gay Fuckos.</v>

2351
01:51:30.790 --> 01:51:35.280
<v Speaker 5>This is what could go wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Every episode of that.</v>

2352
01:51:36.790 --> 01:51:38.870
<v Speaker 5>Did you see the one with The v?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to give any spoilers or</v>

2353
01:51:38.880 --> 01:51:41.770
<v Speaker 5>words with the video game that they put</v>
<v Speaker 5>a chip in your brain.</v>

2354
01:51:41.840 --> 01:51:42.870
<v Speaker 5>You see that one?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yup.</v>

2355
01:51:43.300 --> 01:51:46.690
<v Speaker 5>Holy Shit Man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's 100% going to happen.</v>

2356
01:51:47.030 --> 01:51:48.980
<v Speaker 5>It's going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God,</v>

2359
01:51:55.900 --> 01:51:58.300
<v Speaker 5>It will get bad.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's going to get really good too.</v>

2360
01:51:58.301 --> 01:52:00.550
<v Speaker 5>I think it's the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's at the same time.</v>

2361
01:52:00.580 --> 01:52:01.690
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that is true.</v>

2362
01:52:01.990 --> 01:52:04.480
<v Speaker 5>I think it's going to get weird and it's</v>
<v Speaker 5>going to get really good.</v>

2363
01:52:04.650 --> 01:52:06.460
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm very optimistic,</v>

2364
01:52:06.820 --> 01:52:09.490
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a lot of the most,</v>

2365
01:52:10.120 --> 01:52:12.790
<v Speaker 5>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a lot of the most informative stuff that</v>

2366
01:52:12.791 --> 01:52:17.791
<v Speaker 5>I learn each and every day are from my</v>
<v Speaker 5>boy that is in college right now,</v>

2367
01:52:19.450 --> 01:52:20.490
<v Speaker 5>Harry.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2368
01:52:21.100 --> 01:52:24.520
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>actually I think he's in charge of,</v>

2369
01:52:24.521 --> 01:52:27.520
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>his science clubs,</v>

2370
01:52:27.521 --> 01:52:30.910
<v Speaker 5>social media.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I forget what it's,</v>

2371
01:52:31.120 --> 01:52:34.150
<v Speaker 5>I forget the instagram.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't have to look it up,</v>

2372
01:52:34.151 --> 01:52:39.151
<v Speaker 5>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I think it's like Simpson Simpson</v>

2373
01:52:40.030 --> 01:52:42.710
<v Speaker 5>Chemistry club or something.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But he's every day,</v>

2374
01:52:42.820 --> 01:52:46.070
<v Speaker 5>every week he posts different Kim facts,</v>

2375
01:52:46.310 --> 01:52:47.960
<v Speaker 7>like chemistry,</v>
<v Speaker 7>facts.</v>

2376
01:52:48.530 --> 01:52:52.340
<v Speaker 7>Science is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If you're someone who doesn't really</v>

2377
01:52:52.341 --> 01:52:55.400
<v Speaker 7>study it,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there's a lot of ridiculous information</v>

2378
01:52:55.401 --> 01:52:57.590
<v Speaker 7>out there.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You start looking at that and you</v>

2379
01:52:57.591 --> 01:53:00.470
<v Speaker 7>realize any of the stuff that we're</v>
<v Speaker 7>talking about,</v>

2380
01:53:00.500 --> 01:53:02.060
<v Speaker 7>it's 100% possible.</v>

2381
01:53:02.520 --> 01:53:03.360
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

2382
01:53:03.780 --> 01:53:08.780
<v Speaker 1>every new innovation builds on potential</v>
<v Speaker 1>new innovations that branch off of them</v>

2383
01:53:09.421 --> 01:53:11.430
<v Speaker 1>and they're were always constantly</v>
<v Speaker 1>pushing the curve.</v>

2384
01:53:11.790 --> 01:53:14.760
<v Speaker 1>It's like they're not staying stagnant</v>
<v Speaker 1>in any industry.</v>

2385
01:53:14.790 --> 01:53:17.760
<v Speaker 1>Like there's nothing where</v>
<v Speaker 1>technologically everybody's stagnant.</v>

2386
01:53:17.910 --> 01:53:20.220
<v Speaker 1>Whether it's automobiles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>automobiles,</v>

2387
01:53:20.370 --> 01:53:21.950
<v Speaker 1>like they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're getting better and better every</v>

2388
01:53:21.951 --> 01:53:23.340
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Computers better and better.</v>

2389
01:53:23.341 --> 01:53:25.590
<v Speaker 1>Everyday phones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>better and better everyday tvs,</v>

2390
01:53:25.591 --> 01:53:27.450
<v Speaker 1>better in bed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just never ending.</v>

2391
01:53:27.660 --> 01:53:32.100
<v Speaker 1>It's not there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are on this constant state of</v>

2392
01:53:32.101 --> 01:53:36.390
<v Speaker 1>innovation and progression that is</v>
<v Speaker 1>really stunning to watch because we're</v>

2393
01:53:36.391 --> 01:53:41.391
<v Speaker 1>almost like watching some cascade of</v>
<v Speaker 1>complexity that is reaching some</v>

2394
01:53:42.660 --> 01:53:44.220
<v Speaker 1>infinite point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did the,</v>

2395
01:53:44.221 --> 01:53:47.160
<v Speaker 1>the newest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>latest a htc vives,</v>

<v Speaker 1>The future's other realities in pill</v>

2400
01:53:57.271 --> 01:53:59.160
<v Speaker 1>form.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Other realities that are going to be</v>

2401
01:53:59.161 --> 01:54:02.370
<v Speaker 1>able to put your hand on a building.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to send you into another</v>

<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2403
01:54:03.601 --> 01:54:07.230
<v Speaker 1>these are really real things that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to address real matrix.</v>

2404
01:54:07.231 --> 01:54:09.960
<v Speaker 1>Really make real matrix within 50 years.</v>

2405
01:54:10.430 --> 01:54:14.730
<v Speaker 7>In 50 years.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Do you think it will desensitize a mean?</v>

2406
01:54:14.790 --> 01:54:16.830
<v Speaker 7>They say video game.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

2407
01:54:17.010 --> 01:54:19.950
<v Speaker 7>back in our day they said music,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

2408
01:54:20.340 --> 01:54:23.100
<v Speaker 7>Music was what?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Desensitize people,</v>

2409
01:54:23.820 --> 01:54:25.550
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's the basis of</v>

2410
01:54:25.740 --> 01:54:28.460
<v Speaker 1>now they say video games.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is right now,</v>

2411
01:54:28.461 --> 01:54:30.090
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trump recently said video games are</v>

2412
01:54:30.091 --> 01:54:31.440
<v Speaker 1>causing violence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is like,</v>

2413
01:54:31.441 --> 01:54:32.274
<v Speaker 1>come on man.</v>

2414
01:54:32.300 --> 01:54:35.240
<v Speaker 7>I don't know if it's causing violence,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but I would certainly,</v>

2415
01:54:35.510 --> 01:54:40.510
<v Speaker 7>I would certainly think that people</v>
<v Speaker 7>desensitized to blood and Gore.</v>

2416
01:54:42.470 --> 01:54:44.360
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>because I mean you're right.</v>

2417
01:54:44.600 --> 01:54:46.670
<v Speaker 7>Back when,</v>
<v Speaker 7>back when we were,</v>

2418
01:54:46.850 --> 01:54:49.220
<v Speaker 7>well you would have been before me,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but</v>

2419
01:54:51.050 --> 01:54:52.490
<v Speaker 7>like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't know,</v>

2420
01:54:52.520 --> 01:54:55.250
<v Speaker 7>grand theft auto.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It was a little bit after my time.</v>

2421
01:54:55.280 --> 01:54:57.980
<v Speaker 7>Like for me it was mortal Kombat.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh yeah.</v>

2422
01:54:58.010 --> 01:55:02.870
<v Speaker 7>The adult population couldn't stand</v>
<v Speaker 7>mortal Kombat because you ripped</v>

2423
01:55:02.871 --> 01:55:07.871
<v Speaker 7>someone's spine out and held it up in</v>
<v Speaker 7>the air and that was it calling.</v>

2424
01:55:08.330 --> 01:55:11.930
<v Speaker 7>Can you talk about that though?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Instead of being desensitized,</v>

2425
01:55:11.931 --> 01:55:15.560
<v Speaker 7>aren't they just not sensitive enough</v>
<v Speaker 7>yet because they haven't been exposed to</v>

2426
01:55:15.561 --> 01:55:17.340
<v Speaker 7>it?</v>
<v Speaker 7>So like you write the piece of what</v>

2427
01:55:17.430 --> 01:55:19.640
<v Speaker 7>you're describing,</v>
<v Speaker 7>a combat lived through Vietnam.</v>

2428
01:55:19.641 --> 01:55:21.290
<v Speaker 7>Like they,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they saw all of that</v>

2429
01:55:22.270 --> 01:55:24.040
<v Speaker 1>as kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're a hundred percent correct.</v>

2430
01:55:24.041 --> 01:55:25.470
<v Speaker 1>Powerful young Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2431
01:55:25.500 --> 01:55:26.810
<v Speaker 1>Good point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a very good,</v>

2432
01:55:27.730 --> 01:55:30.340
<v Speaker 1>very good point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a super good point because that's</v>

2433
01:55:30.341 --> 01:55:32.920
<v Speaker 1>really exactly what's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2434
01:55:32.921 --> 01:55:36.430
<v Speaker 1>they're not experiencing real violence</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe that's the answer.</v>

2435
01:55:36.550 --> 01:55:39.730
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it was like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a real understanding of what real</v>

2436
01:55:39.731 --> 01:55:44.010
<v Speaker 1>violence is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would make you more of</v>

2437
01:55:44.040 --> 01:55:47.280
<v Speaker 2>real violence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the more disconnected we are with</v>

2438
01:55:47.281 --> 01:55:49.290
<v Speaker 2>real violence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more,</v>

2439
01:55:49.380 --> 01:55:53.940
<v Speaker 2>almost as cartoonish expression of</v>
<v Speaker 2>violence as being an alternative for</v>

2440
01:55:53.941 --> 01:55:56.130
<v Speaker 2>being bored,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being an alternative,</v>

2441
01:55:56.131 --> 01:56:00.210
<v Speaker 2>being like bullied or tortured.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like instead of something to be avoided.</v>

2442
01:56:00.211 --> 01:56:03.450
<v Speaker 2>It's like your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your last hurrah before you exit this</v>

2443
01:56:03.451 --> 01:56:04.610
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you're,</v>

2444
01:56:04.611 --> 01:56:06.690
<v Speaker 2>you've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've flipped over the board game,</v>

2445
01:56:06.691 --> 01:56:10.020
<v Speaker 2>you've pulled the plug out on the video</v>
<v Speaker 2>game ness and this is what,</v>

2446
01:56:10.021 --> 01:56:14.800
<v Speaker 2>like extreme violences that it seems to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be more of that maybe even than</v>

2447
01:56:14.830 --> 01:56:17.790
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Definitely could be.</v>

2448
01:56:18.150 --> 01:56:20.460
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2449
01:56:20.610 --> 01:56:23.790
<v Speaker 2>my boy is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's going to school to be a vet</v>

2450
01:56:25.320 --> 01:56:27.570
<v Speaker 2>and he's been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2451
01:56:27.571 --> 01:56:29.850
<v Speaker 2>he's able to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to look at,</v>

2452
01:56:29.880 --> 01:56:34.880
<v Speaker 2>luckily he works for a veterinary clinic</v>
<v Speaker 2>in our town and he's personally been</v>

2453
01:56:35.251 --> 01:56:38.430
<v Speaker 2>there for surgeries and he's been there</v>
<v Speaker 2>for several years.</v>

2454
01:56:38.431 --> 01:56:39.900
<v Speaker 2>So he's seen a lot of things.</v>

2455
01:56:40.470 --> 01:56:41.430
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2456
01:56:42.360 --> 01:56:45.360
<v Speaker 2>the doctors were originally telling him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2457
01:56:45.390 --> 01:56:48.060
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you feel a little bit sensitive this,</v>

2458
01:56:48.061 --> 01:56:50.760
<v Speaker 2>or if you feel like you might pass out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let us know.</v>

2459
01:56:51.270 --> 01:56:54.990
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Harry has been with me through a big</v>

2460
01:56:54.991 --> 01:56:58.500
<v Speaker 2>portion of</v>
<v Speaker 2>his life,</v>

2461
01:56:58.501 --> 01:57:03.240
<v Speaker 2>so he's seen one of these things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seeing things get shot,</v>

2462
01:57:03.480 --> 01:57:06.330
<v Speaker 2>and he'd seen things get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>feel dressed,</v>

2463
01:57:06.780 --> 01:57:11.780
<v Speaker 2>he's seen things get broken apart and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's seen things get cooked for the</v>

2464
01:57:12.031 --> 01:57:16.050
<v Speaker 2>family.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he's literally seen all the stages of</v>

2465
01:57:16.051 --> 01:57:18.210
<v Speaker 2>really what life is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a port,</v>

2466
01:57:18.330 --> 01:57:19.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's living,</v>

2467
01:57:20.180 --> 01:57:24.750
<v Speaker 2>it's dying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then it's being consumed by what is</v>

2468
01:57:24.751 --> 01:57:26.580
<v Speaker 2>living.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2469
01:57:26.640 --> 01:57:29.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were a little bit surprised by the</v>

2470
01:57:29.371 --> 01:57:33.000
<v Speaker 2>fact that he understood all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think because he's experienced</v>

2471
01:57:33.001 --> 01:57:36.210
<v Speaker 2>that he did understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2472
01:57:36.240 --> 01:57:37.950
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2473
01:57:37.951 --> 01:57:42.660
<v Speaker 2>he's experiencing it in a real life</v>
<v Speaker 2>scenario versus in a video or in a book,</v>

2474
01:57:42.680 --> 01:57:43.020
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2475
01:57:43.020 --> 01:57:45.510
<v Speaker 2>You just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no way to learn life from a</v>

2476
01:57:45.511 --> 01:57:48.990
<v Speaker 2>video or a book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What you can do is get exposed to ideas</v>

2477
01:57:48.991 --> 01:57:51.330
<v Speaker 2>that will intrigue you and you want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>have those experiences.</v>

2478
01:57:51.660 --> 01:57:54.420
<v Speaker 2>But this is a giant difference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like the difference between</v>

2479
01:57:54.421 --> 01:57:59.421
<v Speaker 2>watching porn and having sex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I literally is right.</v>

2480
01:57:59.730 --> 01:58:01.360
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's the perfect example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2481
01:58:01.560 --> 01:58:04.240
<v Speaker 2>it actually is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is the perfect example of that.</v>

2482
01:58:04.320 --> 01:58:07.560
<v Speaker 2>You have to experience things and until</v>
<v Speaker 2>you do,</v>

2483
01:58:07.620 --> 01:58:09.000
<v Speaker 2>you don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

2484
01:58:09.001 --> 01:58:10.860
<v Speaker 2>we're always battling for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2485
01:58:11.100 --> 01:58:14.880
<v Speaker 2>people take us seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're always battling for our position</v>

2486
01:58:14.881 --> 01:58:18.540
<v Speaker 2>in the social food chain and all that</v>
<v Speaker 2>clouds the way we communicate with each</v>

2487
01:58:18.541 --> 01:58:21.330
<v Speaker 2>other too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we just have to get way better</v>

2488
01:58:21.331 --> 01:58:26.040
<v Speaker 2>at this and I think we're operating on</v>
<v Speaker 2>some were we're in like this weird snake</v>

2489
01:58:26.041 --> 01:58:30.480
<v Speaker 2>shedding of the skin stage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're just got to shake off all the</v>

2490
01:58:30.481 --> 01:58:33.810
<v Speaker 2>stupid shit that was invented by slave</v>
<v Speaker 2>owners.</v>

2491
01:58:34.080 --> 01:58:38.520
<v Speaker 2>All the dumb shit that's been like</v>
<v Speaker 2>involved in our system from the</v>

2492
01:58:38.521 --> 01:58:41.180
<v Speaker 2>beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have to realize like no one knows</v>

2493
01:58:41.181 --> 01:58:42.130
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck's going on.</v>

2494
01:58:42.340 --> 01:58:46.270
<v Speaker 1>We have to look at everything for what</v>
<v Speaker 1>it really is and forget about the past.</v>

2495
01:58:46.740 --> 01:58:48.930
<v Speaker 7>Can we do right now?</v>
<v Speaker 7>What can we do right now?</v>

2496
01:58:49.480 --> 01:58:54.300
<v Speaker 7>And do you think it's like a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 7>things in life where you really,</v>

2497
01:58:54.301 --> 01:58:58.020
<v Speaker 7>really liked something in,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you almost go too far and then in the</v>

2498
01:58:58.021 --> 01:58:59.370
<v Speaker 7>end you think,</v>
<v Speaker 7>okay,</v>

2499
01:58:59.371 --> 01:59:02.820
<v Speaker 7>we've gone maybe a little bit too far.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We're going to back things off.</v>

2500
01:59:03.240 --> 01:59:05.400
<v Speaker 7>Do you think that's the truth and what</v>
<v Speaker 7>we're doing right now?</v>

2501
01:59:05.430 --> 01:59:10.110
<v Speaker 7>Do you think we're almost becoming too</v>
<v Speaker 7>lenient?</v>

2502
01:59:10.440 --> 01:59:12.300
<v Speaker 7>And then we're going to get to the point</v>
<v Speaker 7>where like,</v>

2503
01:59:12.301 --> 01:59:15.420
<v Speaker 7>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we have to have some,</v>

2504
01:59:16.340 --> 01:59:21.340
<v Speaker 7>some discipline to where I wasn't a</v>
<v Speaker 7>starbucks the other day I thought about</v>

2505
01:59:22.771 --> 01:59:23.880
<v Speaker 7>posting it,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but I didn't,</v>

2506
01:59:23.940 --> 01:59:25.470
<v Speaker 7>I actually thought about sending it to</v>
<v Speaker 7>you,</v>

2507
01:59:25.471 --> 01:59:26.670
<v Speaker 7>but I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But it was,</v>

2508
01:59:29.310 --> 01:59:32.430
<v Speaker 7>it was in a starbucks and it said,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

2509
01:59:32.490 --> 01:59:35.460
<v Speaker 7>there was a bathroom that said any sex</v>
<v Speaker 7>and there was a male,</v>

2510
01:59:35.490 --> 01:59:38.190
<v Speaker 7>a woman and a guy in a wheelchair.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm like,</v>

2511
01:59:38.191 --> 01:59:42.990
<v Speaker 7>since when?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Since when is a a person in a</v>

2512
01:59:42.991 --> 01:59:45.330
<v Speaker 7>wheelchair,</v>
<v Speaker 7>a sex like,</v>

2513
01:59:45.390 --> 01:59:48.180
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's almost like they're afraid to,</v>

2514
01:59:48.610 --> 01:59:53.610
<v Speaker 7>to put something on the door to where</v>
<v Speaker 7>they just make it as broad as possible</v>

2515
01:59:56.000 --> 01:59:57.180
<v Speaker 7>and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2516
01:59:57.181 --> 02:00:01.530
<v Speaker 7>we have to have,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we have to have some lines.</v>

2517
02:00:01.950 --> 02:00:04.980
<v Speaker 7>Otherwise it's just nothing but gray.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well there's not,</v>

2518
02:00:05.090 --> 02:00:08.200
<v Speaker 1>here's the thing man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think all this is in response to the</v>

2519
02:00:08.201 --> 02:00:10.570
<v Speaker 1>idea that men and women are competing</v>
<v Speaker 1>against each other.</v>

2520
02:00:10.810 --> 02:00:12.610
<v Speaker 1>I think that's what we've got to cut the</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

2521
02:00:13.090 --> 02:00:18.090
<v Speaker 7>I think if this idea that like there's a</v>
<v Speaker 7>diff,</v>

2522
02:00:18.880 --> 02:00:20.710
<v Speaker 7>like there's no doubt</v>

2523
02:00:21.280 --> 02:00:22.540
<v Speaker 1>that you need women</v>

2524
02:00:24.310 --> 02:00:26.860
<v Speaker 1>and you need men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need humans,</v>

2525
02:00:26.920 --> 02:00:28.090
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need each other.</v>

2526
02:00:28.240 --> 02:00:30.430
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we've got to figure out like why is</v>

2527
02:00:30.431 --> 02:00:33.400
<v Speaker 1>everybody so hung up on gender?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there an imbalance?</v>

2528
02:00:33.700 --> 02:00:36.730
<v Speaker 1>And whatever that imbalance is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's got to be corrected,</v>

2529
02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:42.000
<v Speaker 1>but it's got to be corrected honorably</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's got to be corrected.</v>

2530
02:00:42.460 --> 02:00:44.740
<v Speaker 1>Honestly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we have to be nice to each other.</v>

2531
02:00:44.770 --> 02:00:46.270
<v Speaker 1>All of us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we like each other.</v>

2532
02:00:46.450 --> 02:00:48.220
<v Speaker 1>Girls like boys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boys like girls.</v>

2533
02:00:48.221 --> 02:00:51.370
<v Speaker 1>That's how it's always been.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And any aberrations of that can really</v>

2534
02:00:51.371 --> 02:00:54.430
<v Speaker 1>fuck your head up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think they're more aberrations</v>

2535
02:00:54.460 --> 02:00:57.520
<v Speaker 1>than they are the norm and I think we</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to figure out how to make those</v>

2536
02:00:57.521 --> 02:01:01.570
<v Speaker 1>aberrations lesser and lesser and no</v>
<v Speaker 1>one's concentrating on that.</v>

2537
02:01:01.600 --> 02:01:03.310
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're concentrating on boys versus</v>

2538
02:01:03.311 --> 02:01:06.910
<v Speaker 1>girls and I think that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like if you only like men,</v>

2539
02:01:06.911 --> 02:01:08.260
<v Speaker 1>I can't hang out with you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

2540
02:01:08.490 --> 02:01:10.990
<v Speaker 1>You're going to say some fucked up shit</v>
<v Speaker 1>about women and I'm going to go,</v>

2541
02:01:10.991 --> 02:01:12.820
<v Speaker 1>that's my daughter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's my sister.</v>

2542
02:01:12.821 --> 02:01:14.890
<v Speaker 1>That's my mom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't do that.</v>

2543
02:01:15.130 --> 02:01:19.810
<v Speaker 1>Like this idea that like we're on a team</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we're on team dicks and team vaginas</v>

2544
02:01:19.811 --> 02:01:23.410
<v Speaker 1>trying to fucking steal our gold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like this is stupid.</v>

2545
02:01:23.560 --> 02:01:25.720
<v Speaker 1>It's stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's stupid.</v>

2546
02:01:25.750 --> 02:01:28.720
<v Speaker 1>We can't do that anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like we can't do team white people.</v>

2547
02:01:28.870 --> 02:01:30.070
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not good either.</v>

2548
02:01:30.640 --> 02:01:33.880
<v Speaker 1>It's not good team.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A fucking beige people.</v>

2549
02:01:33.970 --> 02:01:36.730
<v Speaker 1>If you all beige people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all beige people speak Spanish,</v>

2550
02:01:36.731 --> 02:01:38.410
<v Speaker 1>get on a team.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come on.</v>

2551
02:01:38.620 --> 02:01:41.180
<v Speaker 1>What are we doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all the same.</v>

2552
02:01:41.181 --> 02:01:43.940
<v Speaker 1>It's whether it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's sexual orientation,</v>

2553
02:01:43.941 --> 02:01:45.200
<v Speaker 1>whether it's gay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>straight,</v>

2554
02:01:45.201 --> 02:01:46.580
<v Speaker 1>whether it's black,</v>
<v Speaker 1>white,</v>

2555
02:01:46.610 --> 02:01:47.810
<v Speaker 1>male,</v>
<v Speaker 1>female,</v>

2556
02:01:48.240 --> 02:01:49.280
<v Speaker 1>Asian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Spanish,</v>

2557
02:01:49.281 --> 02:01:51.770
<v Speaker 1>Galleon people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

2558
02:01:51.771 --> 02:01:53.240
<v Speaker 1>nice people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting people,</v>

2559
02:01:53.241 --> 02:01:55.730
<v Speaker 1>different people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have to learn that we're in a global</v>

2560
02:01:55.731 --> 02:01:57.830
<v Speaker 1>community,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like who really have to figure it out.</v>

2561
02:01:58.220 --> 02:02:01.010
<v Speaker 1>And we're closer and closer than we've</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever been before.</v>

2562
02:02:01.011 --> 02:02:02.840
<v Speaker 1>But along the way we're going to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous shit.</v>

2563
02:02:03.230 --> 02:02:06.950
<v Speaker 1>We're going to get like people that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>completely overreacting and all men are</v>

2564
02:02:06.951 --> 02:02:11.900
<v Speaker 1>sexist and all men are rapists and all</v>
<v Speaker 1>sex with a penis and vagina is rape.</v>

2565
02:02:12.200 --> 02:02:13.970
<v Speaker 1>And there's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of that going on right</v>

2566
02:02:13.971 --> 02:02:14.750
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's,</v>

2567
02:02:14.750 --> 02:02:18.170
<v Speaker 1>those are the echoes of the farthest</v>
<v Speaker 1>reaches of the idea.</v>

2568
02:02:18.171 --> 02:02:20.870
<v Speaker 1>And then that idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll pull back into the middle and then</v>

2569
02:02:20.871 --> 02:02:23.570
<v Speaker 1>the general consensus will be</v>
<v Speaker 1>established.</v>

2570
02:02:24.020 --> 02:02:24.980
<v Speaker 1>That's what people do.</v>

2571
02:02:25.690 --> 02:02:27.940
<v Speaker 7>Did I ever tell you about the time I</v>
<v Speaker 7>went to India?</v>

2572
02:02:28.510 --> 02:02:29.920
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I did.</v>

2573
02:02:30.700 --> 02:02:33.610
<v Speaker 7>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I went to India for just short of a</v>

2574
02:02:33.611 --> 02:02:36.880
<v Speaker 7>month coaching.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And uh,</v>

2575
02:02:36.980 --> 02:02:38.830
<v Speaker 7>you did tell me this.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>

2576
02:02:38.831 --> 02:02:40.810
<v Speaker 7>now I remember.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

2577
02:02:41.860 --> 02:02:44.830
<v Speaker 7>it's a pretty good story.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But the first part was I wanted to try</v>

2578
02:02:44.831 --> 02:02:47.010
<v Speaker 7>to blend in.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I never been to a third,</v>

2579
02:02:47.350 --> 02:02:52.350
<v Speaker 7>third large giant man in America,</v>
<v Speaker 7>in America,</v>

2580
02:02:53.030 --> 02:02:54.640
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>do we take pictures together?</v>

2581
02:02:54.641 --> 02:02:56.080
<v Speaker 7>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's like,</v>

2582
02:02:56.110 --> 02:02:58.990
<v Speaker 7>it's cute.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm like looking up at your armpits so</v>

2583
02:02:58.991 --> 02:03:02.290
<v Speaker 7>you are in your giant for a place that</v>
<v Speaker 7>doesn't have giant people.</v>

2584
02:03:02.380 --> 02:03:03.660
<v Speaker 7>I told him,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I said I will,</v>

2585
02:03:03.730 --> 02:03:06.250
<v Speaker 7>I'll come down and coach,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'll work for a month.</v>

2586
02:03:06.280 --> 02:03:07.113
<v Speaker 7>But I said,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I,</v>

2587
02:03:07.160 --> 02:03:09.310
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I was more worried about my safety than</v>

2588
02:03:09.311 --> 02:03:11.380
<v Speaker 7>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So I said I'll come down,</v>

2589
02:03:11.381 --> 02:03:13.290
<v Speaker 7>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I really want to,</v>

2590
02:03:14.170 --> 02:03:16.750
<v Speaker 7>I want to have a good flight.</v>

2591
02:03:17.020 --> 02:03:19.100
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I was going along way and said I want</v>

2592
02:03:19.101 --> 02:03:20.830
<v Speaker 7>to,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if I'm on the train,</v>

2593
02:03:20.920 --> 02:03:22.960
<v Speaker 7>cause I knew I had about a four hour</v>
<v Speaker 7>train ride.</v>

2594
02:03:22.990 --> 02:03:25.060
<v Speaker 7>I said I want first class,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2595
02:03:25.420 --> 02:03:29.680
<v Speaker 7>start to finish.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And I don't want to sound like a Prima</v>

2596
02:03:29.680 --> 02:03:31.390
<v Speaker 7>Donna,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but I also knew that I was going to a</v>

2597
02:03:31.391 --> 02:03:35.110
<v Speaker 7>third world country.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So asking for first class doesn't</v>

2598
02:03:35.140 --> 02:03:39.490
<v Speaker 7>necessarily mean firstclass here.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

2599
02:03:39.700 --> 02:03:44.140
<v Speaker 7>so anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 7>firstclass meant that my seats on my</v>

2600
02:03:44.141 --> 02:03:45.650
<v Speaker 7>train had,</v>
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

2601
02:03:45.670 --> 02:03:50.670
<v Speaker 7>vinyl covering on there.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So I flew into my airport,</v>

2602
02:03:52.090 --> 02:03:54.100
<v Speaker 7>got off the train,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I was trying to blend in,</v>

2603
02:03:54.130 --> 02:03:58.510
<v Speaker 7>had some old blue jeans on,</v>
<v Speaker 7>gray shirt,</v>

2604
02:03:58.870 --> 02:04:03.820
<v Speaker 7>literally stepped off and it was like</v>
<v Speaker 7>the DJ fricking scratch the record from</v>

2605
02:04:03.821 --> 02:04:06.940
<v Speaker 7>like song five to song one.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It was like,</v>

2606
02:04:07.440 --> 02:04:08.273
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2607
02:04:09.030 --> 02:04:14.030
<v Speaker 7>And literally every single like a sea of</v>
<v Speaker 7>people that were two feet shorter than</v>

2608
02:04:14.911 --> 02:04:18.300
<v Speaker 7>me just literally stopped trains,</v>
<v Speaker 7>stopped everything,</v>

2609
02:04:18.301 --> 02:04:23.301
<v Speaker 7>stopped everyone looked at the six and a</v>
<v Speaker 7>half foot dude standing in this Indian</v>

2610
02:04:26.160 --> 02:04:29.940
<v Speaker 7>fricking trained train depot.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And uh,</v>

2611
02:04:29.970 --> 02:04:34.190
<v Speaker 7>I thought all right,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so I'm to so much for blending in and</v>

2612
02:04:34.191 --> 02:04:38.310
<v Speaker 7>went up to the first class,</v>
<v Speaker 7>a train lounge,</v>

2613
02:04:38.311 --> 02:04:42.870
<v Speaker 7>which was pretty much the train's loud,</v>
<v Speaker 7>a train lounge that had seats.</v>

2614
02:04:43.410 --> 02:04:46.520
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>went up there and made friends with the</v>

2615
02:04:46.530 --> 02:04:51.530
<v Speaker 7>cockroach that was in the bathroom.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And then I got on the train,</v>

2616
02:04:52.170 --> 02:04:54.830
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>did about three to four hours on a</v>

2617
02:04:54.831 --> 02:04:56.080
<v Speaker 7>train.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>

2618
02:04:56.100 --> 02:05:00.240
<v Speaker 7>we stopped a few times cause there were</v>
<v Speaker 7>some cows on the tracks.</v>

2619
02:05:00.420 --> 02:05:02.340
<v Speaker 7>You're not allowed to mess with the</v>
<v Speaker 7>cows.</v>

2620
02:05:02.341 --> 02:05:06.210
<v Speaker 7>I guess so we had to wait for them to</v>
<v Speaker 7>naturally move off the tracks.</v>

2621
02:05:06.570 --> 02:05:09.510
<v Speaker 7>Beep.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There was actually two dead bodies on</v>

2622
02:05:09.511 --> 02:05:10.344
<v Speaker 7>our train.</v>

2623
02:05:10.770 --> 02:05:15.690
<v Speaker 7>Have I ever told you this?</v>
<v Speaker 7>There are two dead bodies and they put</v>

2624
02:05:15.691 --> 02:05:20.220
<v Speaker 7>the dead bodies in the,</v>
<v Speaker 7>on the floor of the aisle between the</v>

2625
02:05:20.221 --> 02:05:24.090
<v Speaker 7>people.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So our s our seats had vinyl on there.</v>

2626
02:05:24.091 --> 02:05:27.420
<v Speaker 7>The first class,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the non firstclass did not.</v>

2627
02:05:27.990 --> 02:05:31.380
<v Speaker 7>I remember at one point I looked back</v>
<v Speaker 7>in,</v>

2628
02:05:32.160 --> 02:05:35.700
<v Speaker 7>there was two dead bodies that had</v>
<v Speaker 7>sheets over him.</v>

2629
02:05:36.330 --> 02:05:40.320
<v Speaker 7>And then in the far back of the train,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like where the trains connect,</v>

2630
02:05:40.770 --> 02:05:42.620
<v Speaker 7>there was actually a,</v>
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

2631
02:05:42.780 --> 02:05:47.780
<v Speaker 7>an Indian guy that was squatting down</v>
<v Speaker 7>pretty much rip and has dong a backwards</v>

2632
02:05:49.861 --> 02:05:53.930
<v Speaker 7>so that he could take a leak while the</v>
<v Speaker 7>in between the trains.</v>

2633
02:05:53.931 --> 02:05:58.931
<v Speaker 7>Like he opened the door and he was</v>
<v Speaker 7>squatting down letting one rip between</v>

2634
02:05:59.131 --> 02:06:01.350
<v Speaker 7>the trains.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And uh,</v>

2635
02:06:01.650 --> 02:06:03.210
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I was sitting there thinking,</v>

2636
02:06:03.330 --> 02:06:06.720
<v Speaker 7>Oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I've got 20 days left here.</v>

2637
02:06:07.880 --> 02:06:11.850
<v Speaker 7>But in saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>once I got to where I was,</v>

2638
02:06:12.390 --> 02:06:15.330
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they were probably the best students</v>

2639
02:06:15.331 --> 02:06:18.780
<v Speaker 7>I've ever had because they were the most</v>
<v Speaker 7>disciplined.</v>

2640
02:06:18.930 --> 02:06:23.930
<v Speaker 7>Every one of those students wanted to</v>
<v Speaker 7>get out of that lifestyle and they saw</v>

2641
02:06:24.841 --> 02:06:29.841
<v Speaker 7>that being a national level shooter was</v>
<v Speaker 7>going to get them out of that lifestyle.</v>

2642
02:06:31.290 --> 02:06:36.290
<v Speaker 7>So every single thing I taught them,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they took it to a level that was far</v>

2643
02:06:36.901 --> 02:06:41.640
<v Speaker 7>beyond what most people here would ever,</v>
<v Speaker 7>ever,</v>

2644
02:06:41.670 --> 02:06:44.400
<v Speaker 7>ever do.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Did they build as well?</v>

2645
02:06:44.401 --> 02:06:48.750
<v Speaker 7>Did they build beaus they teach them how</v>
<v Speaker 7>to do all that stuff to their peeps?</v>

2646
02:06:48.840 --> 02:06:51.300
<v Speaker 7>Some of their,</v>
<v Speaker 7>some of the people on their national</v>

2647
02:06:51.301 --> 02:06:52.650
<v Speaker 7>team,</v>
<v Speaker 7>their peep site,</v>

2648
02:06:52.680 --> 02:06:57.680
<v Speaker 7>which is the small little circle that's</v>
<v Speaker 7>in your bow string that allows you to</v>

2649
02:06:57.960 --> 02:06:59.940
<v Speaker 7>kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's almost like,</v>

2650
02:06:59.970 --> 02:07:03.120
<v Speaker 7>if you can imagine a rifle he ever rear</v>
<v Speaker 7>sight and a front sight.</v>

2651
02:07:03.150 --> 02:07:07.950
<v Speaker 7>So the peep side is in your string.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's a circle and it's your rear sight</v>

2652
02:07:07.980 --> 02:07:09.750
<v Speaker 7>and then you align it with the front</v>
<v Speaker 7>sight.</v>

2653
02:07:10.260 --> 02:07:13.230
<v Speaker 7>There's was,</v>
<v Speaker 7>theirs was made out of wood.</v>

2654
02:07:14.250 --> 02:07:17.790
<v Speaker 7>They would have a stick with a hole</v>
<v Speaker 7>drilled in it and they would put that in</v>

2655
02:07:17.791 --> 02:07:19.530
<v Speaker 7>their string.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Wow.</v>

2656
02:07:19.890 --> 02:07:24.890
<v Speaker 7>So imagine someone like that in your,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they're giving him instruction and every</v>

2657
02:07:25.681 --> 02:07:29.700
<v Speaker 7>single thing you tell them to do,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they'll do it to the 10th degree because</v>

2658
02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:32.790
<v Speaker 7>they want out.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

2659
02:07:32.820 --> 02:07:37.630
<v Speaker 7>it was extreme motivation.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I felt like everything that I was doing</v>

2660
02:07:37.631 --> 02:07:41.470
<v Speaker 7>from a training point of view was</v>
<v Speaker 7>inadequate to what they were doing.</v>

2661
02:07:41.471 --> 02:07:46.471
<v Speaker 7>The only difference was they didn't have</v>
<v Speaker 7>the education that we had.</v>

2662
02:07:47.440 --> 02:07:49.750
<v Speaker 7>They were disconnected.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I remember,</v>

2663
02:07:49.751 --> 02:07:52.990
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I would actually have to go to an</v>

2664
02:07:52.991 --> 02:07:57.991
<v Speaker 7>Internet cafe and I'd have to pay for</v>
<v Speaker 7>five minutes of Internet,</v>

2665
02:07:58.420 --> 02:08:03.370
<v Speaker 7>like dial up internet to call Sharon.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So,</v>

2666
02:08:03.371 --> 02:08:05.380
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you look at people that are like that,</v>

2667
02:08:05.950 --> 02:08:10.660
<v Speaker 7>they want it at a level that's so far</v>
<v Speaker 7>beyond what a lot of,</v>

2668
02:08:11.020 --> 02:08:13.330
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we're just floating in the gravy over</v>

2669
02:08:13.331 --> 02:08:14.164
<v Speaker 7>here.</v>

2670
02:08:14.260 --> 02:08:15.040
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's,</v>

2671
02:08:15.040 --> 02:08:16.900
<v Speaker 7>it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's true.</v>

2672
02:08:16.930 --> 02:08:17.741
<v Speaker 7>It's totally true.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2673
02:08:17.741 --> 02:08:20.470
<v Speaker 7>You look at some of the,</v>
<v Speaker 7>some of the people I've,</v>

2674
02:08:20.471 --> 02:08:23.050
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I was a keynote speaker at an,</v>

2675
02:08:23.051 --> 02:08:26.770
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>an international coaching convention in</v>

2676
02:08:27.040 --> 02:08:32.040
<v Speaker 7>Brazil before the Olympics there.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And you go down there and you realize</v>

2677
02:08:33.700 --> 02:08:38.700
<v Speaker 7>some of these people are,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they want it way more than the people</v>

2678
02:08:40.361 --> 02:08:43.540
<v Speaker 7>that have it easy and the,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and that was the case though,</v>

2679
02:08:43.541 --> 02:08:43.961
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2680
02:08:43.961 --> 02:08:46.480
<v Speaker 7>That's the case.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's the people that are hungry are</v>

2681
02:08:46.481 --> 02:08:50.080
<v Speaker 7>the ones that are really struggling to</v>
<v Speaker 7>make it.</v>

2682
02:08:50.950 --> 02:08:53.020
<v Speaker 7>And that's what gets tough is,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2683
02:08:53.021 --> 02:08:55.690
<v Speaker 7>learning to stay on top.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

2684
02:08:56.170 --> 02:09:00.820
<v Speaker 7>when you have it easy,</v>
<v Speaker 7>when there's people that are literally</v>

2685
02:09:01.540 --> 02:09:06.160
<v Speaker 7>investing every single day and getting</v>
<v Speaker 7>to that point.</v>

2686
02:09:06.620 --> 02:09:07.311
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2687
02:09:07.311 --> 02:09:08.750
<v Speaker 1>that's the fuel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2688
02:09:08.840 --> 02:09:11.210
<v Speaker 1>Those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the weird things is very</v>

2689
02:09:11.211 --> 02:09:16.211
<v Speaker 1>few people who grow up with like some</v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy inheritance plan and millions</v>

2690
02:09:17.720 --> 02:09:19.840
<v Speaker 1>dollars in the bank as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a bond problem.</v>

2691
02:09:19.880 --> 02:09:22.700
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a giant prior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a big problem.</v>

2692
02:09:22.910 --> 02:09:26.900
<v Speaker 1>It's a giant problem with those people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anybody that grows up in that scenario</v>

2693
02:09:27.410 --> 02:09:32.410
<v Speaker 1>where you are never really taught the</v>
<v Speaker 1>value of accomplishing things and then</v>

2694
02:09:33.351 --> 02:09:35.780
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not just about securing your fate,</v>

2695
02:09:36.110 --> 02:09:40.160
<v Speaker 1>it's also about managing your</v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness and accomplishing things</v>

2696
02:09:40.250 --> 02:09:42.410
<v Speaker 1>is good for you and you can't think it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>not.</v>

2697
02:09:42.440 --> 02:09:46.640
<v Speaker 1>You have to just accept it and learn it</v>
<v Speaker 1>and think of it as a sort of a growing</v>

2698
02:09:46.641 --> 02:09:49.310
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you don't do that,</v>

2699
02:09:49.311 --> 02:09:50.690
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to grow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you don't grow,</v>

2700
02:09:50.691 --> 02:09:52.340
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to be fucked.</v>

2701
02:09:52.341 --> 02:09:54.830
<v Speaker 1>Whether you're rich or you're poor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's your missing the thing.</v>

2702
02:09:55.010 --> 02:09:58.370
<v Speaker 1>The thing is now how many Zeros and ones</v>
<v Speaker 1>you collect.</v>

2703
02:09:58.460 --> 02:10:02.420
<v Speaker 1>That's not the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thing is like how well do you feel</v>

2704
02:10:02.480 --> 02:10:06.380
<v Speaker 1>while you're going through it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you're doing it wrong,</v>

2705
02:10:06.410 --> 02:10:07.700
<v Speaker 1>you've got to figure out what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2706
02:10:07.701 --> 02:10:10.580
<v Speaker 1>obviously having $1 million in the bank</v>
<v Speaker 1>is not doing it right.</v>

2707
02:10:10.581 --> 02:10:12.920
<v Speaker 1>If the dude's still taking pills and</v>
<v Speaker 1>super depressed,</v>

2708
02:10:13.100 --> 02:10:14.300
<v Speaker 1>it's not the money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2709
02:10:14.301 --> 02:10:16.200
<v Speaker 1>So what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the thing in you?</v>

2710
02:10:16.201 --> 02:10:19.430
<v Speaker 1>And I have both met a lot of people in</v>
<v Speaker 1>that category.</v>

2711
02:10:19.431 --> 02:10:23.000
<v Speaker 1>I think everybody you talk to on the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody that's goes through,</v>

2712
02:10:23.001 --> 02:10:24.260
<v Speaker 1>it's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Life is hard.</v>

2713
02:10:24.470 --> 02:10:26.180
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of people that have</v>
<v Speaker 1>fallen,</v>

2714
02:10:26.540 --> 02:10:29.030
<v Speaker 1>fallen into that category,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it could have been me.</v>

2715
02:10:29.031 --> 02:10:31.580
<v Speaker 1>It easily could've.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had different scenarios,</v>

2716
02:10:31.581 --> 02:10:32.960
<v Speaker 1>different circumstances,</v>
<v Speaker 1>different,</v>

2717
02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:35.000
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>different neighborhood.</v>

2718
02:10:35.001 --> 02:10:36.150
<v Speaker 7>I grew up.</v>
<v Speaker 7>In any case,</v>

2719
02:10:36.230 --> 02:10:37.990
<v Speaker 7>it can go wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You,</v>

2720
02:10:37.991 --> 02:10:41.150
<v Speaker 7>you,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you can go down the dark road and all of</v>

2721
02:10:41.151 --> 02:10:42.710
<v Speaker 7>a sudden you're fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's,</v>

2722
02:10:42.711 --> 02:10:46.010
<v Speaker 7>that's the case for all of us.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Do you feel like,</v>

2723
02:10:46.250 --> 02:10:47.360
<v Speaker 7>I feel,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2724
02:10:47.361 --> 02:10:50.870
<v Speaker 7>a lot of people look at me as an archer.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I've been,</v>

2725
02:10:50.871 --> 02:10:51.381
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

2726
02:10:51.381 --> 02:10:53.870
<v Speaker 7>made a very,</v>
<v Speaker 7>very good career.</v>

2727
02:10:54.500 --> 02:10:58.940
<v Speaker 7>I couldn't possibly have made it better.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't think for B for shooting a bow</v>

2728
02:10:58.941 --> 02:11:01.910
<v Speaker 7>for living.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't think I could have made it</v>

2729
02:11:01.911 --> 02:11:05.360
<v Speaker 7>better.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And there's definitely archers that are</v>

2730
02:11:05.361 --> 02:11:08.150
<v Speaker 7>better than me.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I never claimed to be the best.</v>

2731
02:11:08.180 --> 02:11:12.500
<v Speaker 7>I just claim to be the one that is</v>
<v Speaker 7>willing to share the most.</v>

2732
02:11:12.890 --> 02:11:17.180
<v Speaker 7>I don't claim that I have the most</v>
<v Speaker 7>natural title talent.</v>

2733
02:11:17.240 --> 02:11:20.660
<v Speaker 7>I just feel like I,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm willing to share the most,</v>

2734
02:11:21.890 --> 02:11:26.890
<v Speaker 7>but I dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I also feel like feel like there's this,</v>

2735
02:11:28.280 --> 02:11:31.820
<v Speaker 7>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>this part of me that feels like if I</v>

2736
02:11:31.821 --> 02:11:35.450
<v Speaker 7>didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 7>even though I don't have necessarily</v>

2737
02:11:35.451 --> 02:11:38.540
<v Speaker 7>talent,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the fact that I am willing to share it,</v>

2738
02:11:38.541 --> 02:11:43.541
<v Speaker 7>I think it takes it to a different level</v>
<v Speaker 7>because I don't know if I've ever shared</v>

2739
02:11:43.641 --> 02:11:44.510
<v Speaker 7>this with you.</v>

2740
02:11:44.810 --> 02:11:48.140
<v Speaker 7>Do you know about my past as a kid?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2741
02:11:48.290 --> 02:11:49.790
<v Speaker 7>You,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you told me a lot of different things</v>

2742
02:11:49.791 --> 02:11:51.860
<v Speaker 7>about you burn your house down</v>
<v Speaker 7>accidentally.</v>

2743
02:11:53.180 --> 02:11:54.200
<v Speaker 7>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>

2744
02:11:54.650 --> 02:11:56.150
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So a big,</v>

2745
02:11:56.300 --> 02:12:00.920
<v Speaker 7>a big part of why I actually joined</v>
<v Speaker 7>sports to begin with because originally</v>

2746
02:12:00.921 --> 02:12:04.280
<v Speaker 7>I was a skater.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I like to skate and um,</v>

2747
02:12:04.640 --> 02:12:07.160
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I wasn't really into organized sports.</v>

2748
02:12:07.700 --> 02:12:10.280
<v Speaker 7>And the craziest thing is you abandoning</v>
<v Speaker 7>football.</v>

2749
02:12:10.700 --> 02:12:11.750
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>For archery.</v>

2750
02:12:11.780 --> 02:12:12.830
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

2751
02:12:13.370 --> 02:12:16.670
<v Speaker 7>but before that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the reason I got into football's because</v>

2752
02:12:16.671 --> 02:12:21.200
<v Speaker 7>my dad was such a great athlete that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2753
02:12:21.320 --> 02:12:25.100
<v Speaker 7>I played with matches and took it too</v>
<v Speaker 7>far,</v>

2754
02:12:25.130 --> 02:12:30.130
<v Speaker 7>ended up burning my house down,</v>
<v Speaker 7>literally had nothing.</v>

2755
02:12:30.380 --> 02:12:33.260
<v Speaker 7>My mom was in Puerto Rico on a business</v>
<v Speaker 7>trip.</v>

2756
02:12:33.261 --> 02:12:35.640
<v Speaker 7>My Dad was at work,</v>
<v Speaker 7>burned her house.</v>

2757
02:12:35.641 --> 02:12:37.490
<v Speaker 7>So the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

2758
02:12:38.090 --> 02:12:42.260
<v Speaker 7>I remember being there when my family</v>
<v Speaker 7>was sifting through ashes,</v>

2759
02:12:42.290 --> 02:12:47.290
<v Speaker 7>literally trying to find something to</v>
<v Speaker 7>salvage from our history as a family.</v>

2760
02:12:48.380 --> 02:12:52.760
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and my dad was such a stellar athlete</v>

2761
02:12:52.820 --> 02:12:57.230
<v Speaker 7>that I felt like the only thing I could</v>
<v Speaker 7>do to really make him proud of me at</v>

2762
02:12:57.231 --> 02:13:02.231
<v Speaker 7>that point was become a good athlete.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So I focus on becoming a good athlete.</v>

2763
02:13:04.220 --> 02:13:09.220
<v Speaker 7>And that was my drive was because it</v>
<v Speaker 7>wasn't because I really liked it.</v>

2764
02:13:09.350 --> 02:13:11.690
<v Speaker 7>It was because of the fee.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It was because of guilt.</v>

2765
02:13:12.110 --> 02:13:17.110
<v Speaker 7>It was because I really felt like the</v>
<v Speaker 7>only thing I could do to make my dad who</v>

2766
02:13:18.381 --> 02:13:19.910
<v Speaker 7>was,</v>
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

2767
02:13:21.080 --> 02:13:24.140
<v Speaker 7>a military guy,</v>
<v Speaker 7>someone who had definitely earned a</v>

2768
02:13:24.141 --> 02:13:27.380
<v Speaker 7>street creds.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I felt like the only thing I could do</v>

2769
02:13:27.381 --> 02:13:32.381
<v Speaker 7>was become this great athlete,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which he was in order to earn his</v>

2770
02:13:32.851 --> 02:13:36.900
<v Speaker 7>respect.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And Kennedy did that in order to make up</v>

2771
02:13:36.901 --> 02:13:38.730
<v Speaker 7>for the fact that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2772
02:13:38.731 --> 02:13:43.731
<v Speaker 7>I had this one moment as an adolescent</v>
<v Speaker 7>where I literally burn down every single</v>

2773
02:13:45.601 --> 02:13:47.160
<v Speaker 7>thing our family ever had.</v>

2774
02:13:48.540 --> 02:13:51.390
<v Speaker 7>Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 7>man.</v>

2775
02:13:51.780 --> 02:13:52.860
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>imagine going.</v>

2776
02:13:52.950 --> 02:13:55.260
<v Speaker 7>Imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right now when we're done with this</v>

2777
02:13:55.261 --> 02:13:57.690
<v Speaker 7>podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you get a call and you realize your</v>

2778
02:13:57.691 --> 02:14:02.691
<v Speaker 7>house was on fire and</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's different now because we have</v>

2779
02:14:03.271 --> 02:14:06.330
<v Speaker 7>phones.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But imagine we don't have phones.</v>

2780
02:14:07.350 --> 02:14:10.890
<v Speaker 7>Every single picture you have of your</v>
<v Speaker 7>family,</v>

2781
02:14:11.590 --> 02:14:16.170
<v Speaker 7>you know every single one is gone.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Every,</v>

2782
02:14:16.800 --> 02:14:20.140
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>every single thing that maybe someone's</v>

2783
02:14:20.160 --> 02:14:24.210
<v Speaker 7>signed for you and the UFC has gone</v>
<v Speaker 7>every single year.</v>

2784
02:14:24.211 --> 02:14:27.750
<v Speaker 7>Black belt that you got from Eddie is</v>
<v Speaker 7>burn.</v>

2785
02:14:27.960 --> 02:14:30.090
<v Speaker 7>It's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like that's gone.</v>

2786
02:14:31.020 --> 02:14:36.020
<v Speaker 7>Every single thing from right now into</v>
<v Speaker 7>till you were born is gone.</v>

2787
02:14:39.540 --> 02:14:42.600
<v Speaker 7>That's what my parents loss and it was</v>
<v Speaker 7>because of me.</v>

2788
02:14:43.140 --> 02:14:46.680
<v Speaker 7>So you know what man,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they did lose you.</v>

2789
02:14:47.100 --> 02:14:50.430
<v Speaker 7>I think ultimately the difference</v>
<v Speaker 7>between you making a mistake of burn the</v>

2790
02:14:50.431 --> 02:14:51.810
<v Speaker 7>house down,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which is horrific.</v>

2791
02:14:52.050 --> 02:14:53.370
<v Speaker 7>Are you dying?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yup.</v>

2792
02:14:53.430 --> 02:14:55.410
<v Speaker 7>That's the big difference.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like everything worked out.</v>

2793
02:14:55.410 --> 02:14:56.310
<v Speaker 7>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 7>hey you are,</v>

2794
02:14:56.430 --> 02:14:57.480
<v Speaker 7>everything's great.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

2795
02:14:57.481 --> 02:15:00.540
<v Speaker 7>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's what was great about my dad was</v>

2796
02:15:00.541 --> 02:15:05.541
<v Speaker 7>the fact that once that moment happened,</v>
<v Speaker 7>my mom and my dad have never ever</v>

2797
02:15:06.270 --> 02:15:08.280
<v Speaker 7>brought that up.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They've never hold that.</v>

2798
02:15:08.460 --> 02:15:12.900
<v Speaker 7>They've never held that over me.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's been me from the outside looking in</v>

2799
02:15:12.901 --> 02:15:17.901
<v Speaker 7>thinking they've never mentioned this</v>
<v Speaker 7>because they know that I feel so bad</v>

2800
02:15:18.061 --> 02:15:23.061
<v Speaker 7>about it,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but me being competitive as a,</v>

2801
02:15:24.210 --> 02:15:29.160
<v Speaker 7>as an athlete was because I wanted to</v>
<v Speaker 7>make my dad proud from that aspect and</v>

2802
02:15:29.190 --> 02:15:34.190
<v Speaker 7>literally that competitive drive as a</v>
<v Speaker 7>football player and track or whatever</v>

2803
02:15:35.731 --> 02:15:39.510
<v Speaker 7>else that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that fed the archery side.</v>

2804
02:15:39.511 --> 02:15:42.270
<v Speaker 7>Because when I went to my archery</v>
<v Speaker 7>tournament for the first time and I</v>

2805
02:15:42.271 --> 02:15:47.271
<v Speaker 7>sucked at it,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I was naturally competitive and really</v>

2806
02:15:47.431 --> 02:15:51.000
<v Speaker 7>wanted to be better at it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Now that wasn't because of the fire,</v>

2807
02:15:51.001 --> 02:15:56.001
<v Speaker 7>but that was just because of really</v>
<v Speaker 7>because of a principle that competitive</v>

2808
02:15:57.391 --> 02:16:00.180
<v Speaker 7>sports put in me,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know?</v>

2809
02:16:00.450 --> 02:16:03.210
<v Speaker 7>So it,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's crazy how,</v>

2810
02:16:03.230 --> 02:16:05.910
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's crazy how it all these little</v>

2811
02:16:05.911 --> 02:16:10.290
<v Speaker 7>pieces build character.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But you know,</v>

2812
02:16:10.291 --> 02:16:12.050
<v Speaker 7>that's why,</v>
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

2813
02:16:12.660 --> 02:16:17.660
<v Speaker 7>several weeks ago there was a really big</v>
<v Speaker 7>archery tournament and I actually got</v>

2814
02:16:18.091 --> 02:16:19.380
<v Speaker 7>wind,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which I'm not,</v>

2815
02:16:19.800 --> 02:16:24.800
<v Speaker 7>I'm not big on kind of feeding in or</v>
<v Speaker 7>buying into negativity at all.</v>

2816
02:16:27.120 --> 02:16:31.780
<v Speaker 7>But there was some,</v>
<v Speaker 7>some negativity that I heard from other</v>

2817
02:16:32.050 --> 02:16:35.170
<v Speaker 7>shooters that are shooting now and</v>
<v Speaker 7>shooting currently saying,</v>

2818
02:16:35.710 --> 02:16:37.090
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>why is this guy,</v>

2819
02:16:37.780 --> 02:16:40.390
<v Speaker 7>why is this guy popular?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Why is it a successful?</v>

2820
02:16:40.391 --> 02:16:43.360
<v Speaker 7>He's not even shooting right now.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He's not even competing.</v>

2821
02:16:43.780 --> 02:16:46.060
<v Speaker 7>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>yeah.</v>

2822
02:16:46.120 --> 02:16:50.440
<v Speaker 7>Dirty Green Monster and V.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

2823
02:16:50.470 --> 02:16:53.210
<v Speaker 7>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It is John Dudley get all the,</v>

2824
02:16:53.640 --> 02:16:54.730
<v Speaker 7>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And,</v>

2825
02:16:55.510 --> 02:16:57.220
<v Speaker 7>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I've been pretty,</v>

2826
02:16:57.221 --> 02:17:01.150
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>are you going to do gollum again?</v>

2827
02:17:01.630 --> 02:17:04.420
<v Speaker 7>He did that on the last podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's not calling.</v>

2828
02:17:04.750 --> 02:17:06.480
<v Speaker 7>It's pretty good though.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

2829
02:17:07.020 --> 02:17:08.080
<v Speaker 7>I dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I feel like,</v>

2830
02:17:08.320 --> 02:17:12.430
<v Speaker 7>I feel like these people that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that feed on the negativity,</v>

2831
02:17:12.431 --> 02:17:15.850
<v Speaker 7>they don't understand that all these</v>
<v Speaker 7>little things that have happened or</v>

2832
02:17:15.851 --> 02:17:20.851
<v Speaker 7>building blocks and I want to use it as</v>
<v Speaker 7>motivation to the people out there.</v>

2833
02:17:23.140 --> 02:17:25.840
<v Speaker 7>Not everyone has a perfect picture,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2834
02:17:25.841 --> 02:17:29.140
<v Speaker 7>people see where maybe you and I are</v>
<v Speaker 7>now,</v>

2835
02:17:29.170 --> 02:17:34.170
<v Speaker 7>but they don't realize.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We also had huge hurdles before we got</v>

2836
02:17:34.661 --> 02:17:37.330
<v Speaker 7>here.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And it's how you address those,</v>

2837
02:17:37.540 --> 02:17:41.890
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and how you take adversity.</v>

2838
02:17:42.400 --> 02:17:46.240
<v Speaker 7>That's really who defines you and it's a</v>
<v Speaker 7>really,</v>

2839
02:17:46.241 --> 02:17:51.241
<v Speaker 7>really good opportunity for you to,</v>
<v Speaker 7>to set a precedence of I had hardship,</v>

2840
02:17:52.990 --> 02:17:55.420
<v Speaker 7>I made over it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And you know,</v>

2841
02:17:55.421 --> 02:18:00.421
<v Speaker 7>you can become inspiration for people by</v>
<v Speaker 7>having that obstacle and then overcoming</v>

2842
02:18:02.831 --> 02:18:02.990
<v Speaker 7>it.</v>

2843
02:18:02.990 --> 02:18:04.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I think that's the big point is</v>

2844
02:18:04.581 --> 02:18:06.360
<v Speaker 1>that we all learned from each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

2845
02:18:06.470 --> 02:18:10.790
<v Speaker 1>most certainly learned from you telling</v>
<v Speaker 1>me about your struggles as well as I</v>

2846
02:18:10.791 --> 02:18:14.330
<v Speaker 1>have from most of my friends that tell</v>
<v Speaker 1>me about their struggles or things that</v>

2847
02:18:14.331 --> 02:18:17.990
<v Speaker 1>I've read about or things that I've seen</v>
<v Speaker 1>in documentaries or things we learn from</v>

2848
02:18:17.991 --> 02:18:18.711
<v Speaker 1>each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you,</v>

2849
02:18:18.711 --> 02:18:19.520
<v Speaker 1>you get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2850
02:18:19.520 --> 02:18:22.490
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we're all accumulating data as</v>

2851
02:18:22.491 --> 02:18:25.820
<v Speaker 1>far as like how the world works,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the best way to behave and what's</v>

2852
02:18:25.821 --> 02:18:28.130
<v Speaker 1>the best way to live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we're all in the middle of</v>

2853
02:18:28.131 --> 02:18:30.860
<v Speaker 1>accumulating all this data.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're all taking it and inform each</v>

2854
02:18:30.861 --> 02:18:32.570
<v Speaker 1>other and we've gotta be open to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2855
02:18:32.571 --> 02:18:36.320
<v Speaker 1>you've got to be open to taking it from</v>
<v Speaker 1>even like,</v>

2856
02:18:36.440 --> 02:18:38.360
<v Speaker 1>although it seems kind of corny</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes,</v>

2857
02:18:38.600 --> 02:18:43.370
<v Speaker 1>like I will read some shit by the rock</v>
<v Speaker 1>or I will watch a Kevin Hart instagram</v>

2858
02:18:43.371 --> 02:18:45.170
<v Speaker 1>video and I get fucking fired up.</v>

2859
02:18:45.190 --> 02:18:47.830
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go do this man and mean if</v>

2860
02:18:47.831 --> 02:18:51.260
<v Speaker 1>it's not jocko saying good or if it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just dope.</v>

2861
02:18:51.530 --> 02:18:54.500
<v Speaker 1>Or when I think about that David Goggins</v>
<v Speaker 1>podcasts,</v>

2862
02:18:54.530 --> 02:18:58.610
<v Speaker 1>I did very good dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think about Goggins and my Jesus</v>

2863
02:18:58.610 --> 02:18:59.443
<v Speaker 1>Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2864
02:18:59.450 --> 02:19:02.120
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't even understand that kind of</v>

2865
02:19:02.180 --> 02:19:04.210
<v Speaker 1>mental intensity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That'd be just,</v>

2866
02:19:04.670 --> 02:19:06.020
<v Speaker 1>he was freaking me out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2867
02:19:06.140 --> 02:19:08.600
<v Speaker 1>who's freaking me out and the most</v>
<v Speaker 1>impressive way,</v>

2868
02:19:08.601 --> 02:19:09.400
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just like,</v>

2869
02:19:09.400 --> 02:19:12.490
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was 100% that goes 100% seriously</v>

2870
02:19:12.500 --> 02:19:13.830
<v Speaker 1>ready to die,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2871
02:19:13.831 --> 02:19:15.620
<v Speaker 1>on a foot race.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's ready to die.</v>

2872
02:19:15.920 --> 02:19:18.290
<v Speaker 1>100% he's looking at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not lying at all,</v>

2873
02:19:18.610 --> 02:19:22.220
<v Speaker 1>was not no party.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's taking it to the dark lands.</v>

2874
02:19:22.221 --> 02:19:23.630
<v Speaker 1>He's going to take you to the dark</v>
<v Speaker 1>lands.</v>

2875
02:19:23.810 --> 02:19:27.080
<v Speaker 1>Will you follow?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Will you follow him to the dark lands</v>

2876
02:19:27.110 --> 02:19:32.110
<v Speaker 1>gam those ceos and does the same?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He took us to the dark land with</v>

2877
02:19:33.561 --> 02:19:35.900
<v Speaker 1>Tequila,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Tequila universe.</v>

2878
02:19:36.200 --> 02:19:37.550
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'll do it with everything.</v>

2879
02:19:37.790 --> 02:19:39.080
<v Speaker 1>He's an animal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

2880
02:19:39.140 --> 02:19:42.260
<v Speaker 1>but those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those people and they expresses itself</v>

2881
02:19:42.261 --> 02:19:44.390
<v Speaker 1>differently in all these different</v>
<v Speaker 1>exceptional people.</v>

2882
02:19:44.391 --> 02:19:47.120
<v Speaker 1>Like Jocko is different than Tim.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tim Kennedy.</v>

2883
02:19:47.390 --> 02:19:49.250
<v Speaker 1>Ted Kennedy is different than Andy</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

2884
02:19:49.270 --> 02:19:53.420
<v Speaker 1>There were all different but also all</v>
<v Speaker 1>incredibly exceptional.</v>

2885
02:19:53.450 --> 02:19:55.040
<v Speaker 1>But there's something that they give</v>
<v Speaker 1>off.</v>

2886
02:19:55.350 --> 02:19:58.100
<v Speaker 7>I like that though.</v>
<v Speaker 7>When you talked about the exception</v>

2887
02:19:58.130 --> 02:19:59.320
<v Speaker 7>among the accent.</v>

2888
02:19:59.610 --> 02:20:00.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what,</v>

2889
02:20:00.721 --> 02:20:01.560
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

2890
02:20:01.561 --> 02:20:03.840
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'd called it David Goggins called it</v>

2891
02:20:04.200 --> 02:20:07.260
<v Speaker 1>uncommon amongst uncommon people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>

2892
02:20:08.040 --> 02:20:09.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is very,</v>

2893
02:20:09.631 --> 02:20:12.420
<v Speaker 1>very true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the Colby Bryan and killing</v>

2894
02:20:12.421 --> 02:20:17.421
<v Speaker 1>people right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just,</v>

2895
02:20:18.270 --> 02:20:20.190
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I read this thing about Kobe Bryant the</v>

2896
02:20:20.190 --> 02:20:20.990
<v Speaker 1>other day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just reading,</v>

2897
02:20:20.990 --> 02:20:23.220
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know anything about basketball.</v>

2898
02:20:23.280 --> 02:20:25.380
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I always refer to Jamie,</v>

2899
02:20:25.530 --> 02:20:29.400
<v Speaker 1>but anything in basketball,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have zero idea.</v>

2900
02:20:29.700 --> 02:20:31.350
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how long it takes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can take a day.</v>

2901
02:20:31.440 --> 02:20:33.330
<v Speaker 1>How many corridors?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea.</v>

2902
02:20:33.630 --> 02:20:36.030
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine if you say quarters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd say there's four of them.</v>

2903
02:20:36.500 --> 02:20:38.750
<v Speaker 1>Can you see how many periods?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how many.</v>

2904
02:20:38.760 --> 02:20:40.710
<v Speaker 1>Half Times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was reading all this stuff about</v>

2905
02:20:40.980 --> 02:20:43.410
<v Speaker 1>his high school coach saying that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>would,</v>

2906
02:20:43.440 --> 02:20:47.550
<v Speaker 1>they would get there and he would be</v>
<v Speaker 1>shooting baskets in the dark because</v>

2907
02:20:47.551 --> 02:20:49.260
<v Speaker 1>they hadn't even turned the lights on</v>
<v Speaker 1>yet.</v>

2908
02:20:49.380 --> 02:20:53.250
<v Speaker 1>He'd be there an hour or two hours</v>
<v Speaker 1>before everybody that he would show up</v>

2909
02:20:53.251 --> 02:20:56.760
<v Speaker 1>at these practices.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody would be at breakfast and he</v>

2910
02:20:56.761 --> 02:21:00.600
<v Speaker 1>would show up with ice on his knees and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was fully sweated out.</v>

2911
02:21:00.601 --> 02:21:03.990
<v Speaker 1>Like he just done three hours of work</v>
<v Speaker 1>and out before anybody did anything.</v>

2912
02:21:04.620 --> 02:21:06.480
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's people like that man,</v>

2913
02:21:06.630 --> 02:21:09.150
<v Speaker 1>and you can hate on them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can hate on them.</v>

2914
02:21:09.151 --> 02:21:12.210
<v Speaker 1>You could decide that this not worth it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you got to,</v>

2915
02:21:12.390 --> 02:21:16.020
<v Speaker 1>the best thing you can do is acknowledge</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they're doing something that makes</v>

2916
02:21:16.021 --> 02:21:17.570
<v Speaker 1>you feel funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

2917
02:21:17.610 --> 02:21:21.780
<v Speaker 1>And that makes you feel funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is your sense of understanding who you</v>

2918
02:21:21.781 --> 02:21:23.040
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's testing,</v>

2919
02:21:23.300 --> 02:21:27.270
<v Speaker 1>testing how you feel about yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's testing how you feel about your</v>

2920
02:21:27.271 --> 02:21:30.480
<v Speaker 1>place in the universe is testing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to know that there's some</v>

<v Speaker 1>baskets.</v>

<v Speaker 7>There's times where I feel like</v>
<v Speaker 7>practicing or a lot of times you'll</v>

2934
02:22:12.231 --> 02:22:16.400

<v Speaker 7>already built your bow and I built a</v>

2935
02:22:16.580 --> 02:22:21.580
<v Speaker 7>four or five in the morning because two</v>
<v Speaker 7>people that are the exceptional among</v>

<v Speaker 7>their field,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they can't sleep if they know that they</v>

2937
02:22:26.371 --> 02:22:28.470
<v Speaker 7>have to do something.</v>
<v Speaker 7>What is,</v>

2938
02:22:28.471 --> 02:22:30.720
<v Speaker 7>what are we looking at something because</v>
<v Speaker 7>as you guys are talking about this,</v>

2939
02:22:30.721 --> 02:22:33.050
<v Speaker 7>he just tore his Achilles.</v>
<v Speaker 7>This is probably one of those last</v>

2940
02:22:33.060 --> 02:22:35.340
<v Speaker 7>things he did.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He tore his Achilles led in order.</v>

2941
02:22:35.580 --> 02:22:37.230
<v Speaker 7>This is like a rule in the game.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He had to shoot.</v>

2942
02:22:37.231 --> 02:22:40.500
<v Speaker 7>His free throws is,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's a weird stipulation.</v>

2943
02:22:40.501 --> 02:22:44.310
<v Speaker 7>So he's walking back out with no</v>
<v Speaker 7>Achilles and he did does this.</v>

2944
02:22:44.340 --> 02:22:45.530
<v Speaker 7>It was pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 7>pretty impressive.</v>

2945
02:22:46.140 --> 02:22:49.680
<v Speaker 7>Barely walk man.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Holy Shit.</v>

2947
02:22:52.130 --> 02:22:53.520
<v Speaker 7>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's really fucked up.</v>

2948
02:22:53.820 --> 02:22:55.890
<v Speaker 7>That's how you have to be.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If you want to be a winner,</v>

2949
02:22:55.950 --> 02:22:57.420
<v Speaker 7>there's just no way around it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

2950
02:22:57.421 --> 02:23:00.360
<v Speaker 7>Swish hollow.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's why I get the money.</v>

2951
02:23:01.130 --> 02:23:06.130
<v Speaker 7>Look at my mansion at that point.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's just subconscious taken over.</v>

2952
02:23:07.110 --> 02:23:10.710
<v Speaker 7>Anybody that doesn't think that someone</v>
<v Speaker 7>like coby Bryant doesn't deserve mansion</v>

2953
02:23:11.280 --> 02:23:14.520
<v Speaker 7>and all the money has just done,</v>
<v Speaker 7>does not understand what he just did.</v>

2954
02:23:14.700 --> 02:23:18.330
<v Speaker 7>Two swishes in a row with no Achilles.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Just shut the fuck up.</v>

2955
02:23:18.331 --> 02:23:20.340
<v Speaker 7>I don't know shit about basketball.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I know.</v>

2956
02:23:20.341 --> 02:23:22.470
<v Speaker 7>That was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I've been pretty,</v>

2957
02:23:23.370 --> 02:23:27.990
<v Speaker 7>I've actually been pretty stuck on this</v>
<v Speaker 7>subject in the last few weeks.</v>

2958
02:23:28.140 --> 02:23:32.520
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I hardly ever,</v>

2959
02:23:32.610 --> 02:23:35.400
<v Speaker 7>ever,</v>
<v Speaker 7>ever look at negativity.</v>

2960
02:23:35.670 --> 02:23:37.950
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I really don't read it,</v>

2961
02:23:37.951 --> 02:23:39.060
<v Speaker 7>don't look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But,</v>

2962
02:23:39.450 --> 02:23:41.850
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there was a really big archery</v>

2963
02:23:41.851 --> 02:23:43.090
<v Speaker 7>tournament,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

2964
02:23:43.210 --> 02:23:48.210
<v Speaker 7>about a month ago and there were some</v>
<v Speaker 7>other pros that had made some comments</v>

2965
02:23:48.961 --> 02:23:50.790
<v Speaker 7>about me just saying,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2966
02:23:51.570 --> 02:23:55.890
<v Speaker 7>how has John Dudley on a gre podcasts,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he's not even competing,</v>

2967
02:23:55.891 --> 02:24:00.380
<v Speaker 7>he's not doing anything.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And you know,</v>

2968
02:24:00.381 --> 02:24:02.690
<v Speaker 7>people wanted to know how I felt about</v>
<v Speaker 7>that.</v>

2969
02:24:02.691 --> 02:24:07.691
<v Speaker 7>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the reality is there's several archer's</v>

2970
02:24:07.761 --> 02:24:10.250
<v Speaker 7>out there that have 10 times the talent</v>
<v Speaker 7>in me.</v>

2971
02:24:10.490 --> 02:24:12.890
<v Speaker 7>No question.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm not saying that I have that,</v>

2972
02:24:15.010 --> 02:24:20.010
<v Speaker 7>but what really is shitty about that</v>
<v Speaker 7>situation is when someone has 10 times</v>

2973
02:24:20.070 --> 02:24:22.840
<v Speaker 7>more talent in me and they do a 10th as</v>
<v Speaker 7>much,</v>

2974
02:24:24.660 --> 02:24:28.110
<v Speaker 7>to me that's a big problem.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So you think there's a lot of people out</v>

2975
02:24:28.111 --> 02:24:31.110
<v Speaker 7>there that are not realizing their full</v>
<v Speaker 7>potential.</v>

2976
02:24:31.111 --> 02:24:33.750
<v Speaker 7>So because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they're critical of other people because</v>

2977
02:24:33.751 --> 02:24:35.930
<v Speaker 7>maybe even they're looking at their own</v>
<v Speaker 7>self and they,</v>

2978
02:24:36.150 --> 02:24:38.040
<v Speaker 7>they feel like they're not,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't know.</v>

2979
02:24:38.880 --> 02:24:41.850
<v Speaker 7>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think they're looking at the problem</v>

2980
02:24:41.851 --> 02:24:43.650
<v Speaker 7>is because the people do do that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

2981
02:24:43.651 --> 02:24:45.060
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>absolutely.</v>

2982
02:24:45.570 --> 02:24:50.570
<v Speaker 7>You limit yourself when you are not</v>
<v Speaker 7>looking at what you're doing,</v>

2983
02:24:51.690 --> 02:24:54.720
<v Speaker 7>when you're so occupied on what someone</v>
<v Speaker 7>else is doing,</v>

2984
02:24:55.320 --> 02:24:58.800
<v Speaker 7>you limit what your true talent is.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So is that my problem?</v>

2985
02:24:59.400 --> 02:25:02.910
<v Speaker 7>Is it my problem that you have 10 times</v>
<v Speaker 7>the talent in me,</v>

2986
02:25:03.300 --> 02:25:06.120
<v Speaker 7>but I'm doing 10 times more with it?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Is that,</v>

2987
02:25:06.300 --> 02:25:09.270
<v Speaker 7>is that my problem as a big numbers?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Okay,</v>

2988
02:25:09.271 --> 02:25:11.220
<v Speaker 7>let's say two times.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>

2989
02:25:11.670 --> 02:25:12.503
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Let's say,</v>

2990
02:25:13.140 --> 02:25:17.670
<v Speaker 7>let's say you have twice a town</v>
<v Speaker 7>naturally have more,</v>

2991
02:25:17.730 --> 02:25:19.200
<v Speaker 7>but you're doing less,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

2992
02:25:19.530 --> 02:25:20.230
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I know what you're saying.</v>

2993
02:25:20.230 --> 02:25:22.600
<v Speaker 7>I just feel like there's a lot of people</v>
<v Speaker 7>doing that,</v>

2994
02:25:22.610 --> 02:25:23.560
<v Speaker 7>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there's,</v>

2995
02:25:23.650 --> 02:25:26.230
<v Speaker 7>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I actually think the majority,</v>

2996
02:25:26.320 --> 02:25:31.320
<v Speaker 7>I think the people that are standouts</v>
<v Speaker 7>are people that don't have the natural,</v>

2997
02:25:33.460 --> 02:25:37.690
<v Speaker 7>true talent.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think Jon Jones is a perfect example.</v>

2998
02:25:38.260 --> 02:25:43.260
<v Speaker 7>If he was able to literally 100%</v>
<v Speaker 7>maximizes talent,</v>

2999
02:25:43.961 --> 02:25:48.961
<v Speaker 7>how good could he be?</v>
<v Speaker 7>The problem is he's the one that has 10</v>

3000
02:25:49.061 --> 02:25:53.380
<v Speaker 7>times the talent,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but he's screwing it up and there's guys</v>

3001
02:25:53.381 --> 02:25:58.381
<v Speaker 7>that have half the talent that are</v>
<v Speaker 7>bigger stars because they're actually</v>

3002
02:25:58.570 --> 02:26:01.900
<v Speaker 7>doing it the right way and they're</v>
<v Speaker 7>maximize.</v>

3003
02:26:01.990 --> 02:26:05.200
<v Speaker 7>They're almost,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they're almost doubling their potential</v>

3004
02:26:05.201 --> 02:26:10.201
<v Speaker 7>because they're working at it in the</v>
<v Speaker 7>right fashion versus someone that has</v>

3005
02:26:11.440 --> 02:26:15.010
<v Speaker 7>the true talent isn't really maximizing</v>
<v Speaker 7>their talent.</v>

3006
02:26:15.790 --> 02:26:17.400
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know he's saying,</v>

3007
02:26:17.550 --> 02:26:20.220
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think here's a good sign.</v>

3008
02:26:20.550 --> 02:26:23.160
<v Speaker 1>He's a really good sign.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is an easy way to decipher it.</v>

3009
02:26:23.700 --> 02:26:26.550
<v Speaker 1>When you see someone complaining about</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone else's success,</v>

3010
02:26:28.380 --> 02:26:31.470
<v Speaker 1>anytime you see that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anytime you see someone complaining</v>

3011
02:26:31.740 --> 02:26:36.570
<v Speaker 1>about someone else's success and</v>
<v Speaker 1>possibly equate again to like some</v>

3012
02:26:36.571 --> 02:26:39.090
<v Speaker 1>injustice in the world because they</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have equal success,</v>

3013
02:26:40.080 --> 02:26:43.260
<v Speaker 1>the person's making a mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're making mistake and even the way</v>

3014
02:26:43.261 --> 02:26:45.480
<v Speaker 1>they're thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you criticize something because you</v>

3015
02:26:45.481 --> 02:26:48.150
<v Speaker 1>just think it's bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's certainly your prerogative,</v>

3016
02:26:48.440 --> 02:26:49.300
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you just,</v>

3017
02:26:49.390 --> 02:26:51.210
<v Speaker 1>if it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if it's an art form or if</v>

3018
02:26:51.211 --> 02:26:54.540
<v Speaker 1>it's something someone created,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's one thing,</v>

3019
02:26:54.990 --> 02:26:57.870
<v Speaker 1>but if you're upset that someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>success,</v>

3020
02:26:58.230 --> 02:27:00.420
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3021
02:27:00.600 --> 02:27:03.690
<v Speaker 1>they want it to be successful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They did the thing that it took to be</v>

3022
02:27:03.691 --> 02:27:05.730
<v Speaker 1>successful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They became successful.</v>

3023
02:27:05.850 --> 02:27:07.440
<v Speaker 1>And what's your point?</v>

3024
02:27:07.800 --> 02:27:10.350
<v Speaker 1>You don't have a point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your point is born a mood.</v>

3025
02:27:10.470 --> 02:27:13.020
<v Speaker 1>It's the little little kids version of</v>
<v Speaker 1>would me,</v>

3026
02:27:13.080 --> 02:27:14.370
<v Speaker 1>what about me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3027
02:27:14.430 --> 02:27:15.750
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not fair.</v>

3028
02:27:15.840 --> 02:27:18.390
<v Speaker 1>It's not fair that some people are born</v>
<v Speaker 1>billionaires.</v>

3029
02:27:18.450 --> 02:27:21.180
<v Speaker 1>It's not fair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not fair that some people are born</v>

3030
02:27:21.181 --> 02:27:23.280
<v Speaker 1>with birth defects where they don't have</v>
<v Speaker 1>feet.</v>

3031
02:27:23.310 --> 02:27:25.170
<v Speaker 1>It's not fair that some people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their their,</v>

3032
02:27:25.180 --> 02:27:27.720
<v Speaker 1>their fucking brain doesn't work as well</v>
<v Speaker 1>as yours.</v>

3033
02:27:27.721 --> 02:27:29.020
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not fair.</v>

3034
02:27:29.620 --> 02:27:31.620
<v Speaker 1>Look at what you got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at what you got.</v>

3035
02:27:31.770 --> 02:27:35.790
<v Speaker 1>You're doing well and you're worried</v>
<v Speaker 1>about someone else's doing better.</v>

3036
02:27:35.850 --> 02:27:38.790
<v Speaker 1>Why not just look at them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why not just look at them and go,</v>

3037
02:27:38.791 --> 02:27:40.080
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does that guy do in different,</v>

3038
02:27:40.081 --> 02:27:43.320
<v Speaker 1>what is she doing different than me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How come she's so much more successful?</v>

3039
02:27:43.470 --> 02:27:46.380
<v Speaker 1>How did he figure out how to do that and</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at it that way?</v>

3040
02:27:46.380 --> 02:27:48.240
<v Speaker 1>Don't look at it like you're angry at</v>
<v Speaker 1>those people.</v>

3041
02:27:48.241 --> 02:27:51.120
<v Speaker 1>That shit is wasted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't do you any good.</v>

3042
02:27:51.150 --> 02:27:53.940
<v Speaker 1>It does zero good for anybody involved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not You,</v>

3043
02:27:53.941 --> 02:27:55.140
<v Speaker 1>not the person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your person.</v>

3044
02:27:55.141 --> 02:27:57.970
<v Speaker 1>You're trying to figure out why that was</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking good.</v>

3045
02:27:57.980 --> 02:27:59.760
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That shit is just bad for you.</v>

3046
02:27:59.820 --> 02:28:02.550
<v Speaker 1>It's bad for everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's bad for the person thinking</v>

3047
02:28:02.551 --> 02:28:05.340
<v Speaker 1>negatively.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's bad for everybody around them.</v>

3048
02:28:05.790 --> 02:28:07.440
<v Speaker 1>The best way to do is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

3049
02:28:08.180 --> 02:28:09.960
<v Speaker 1>Like even if you not even hateful about</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

02:28:09.961 --> 02:28:11.760
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like here's a good example.</v>

3051
02:28:11.880 --> 02:28:14.430
<v Speaker 1>Like if a movie is fucking giant in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>box office,</v>

<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

3053

<v Speaker 1>I thought it sucked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't like it or whatever.</v>

3054
02:28:19.500 --> 02:28:22.670
<v Speaker 1>But if you freak out hose full move with</v>

<v Speaker 5>for fucking Jumanji can't.</v>

3058

<v Speaker 5>You gotta to let that go.</v>

3059
02:28:36.910 --> 02:28:39.470

<v Speaker 5>best performances and years and whoever</v>

<v Speaker 5>She was great too though.</v>

3066
02:28:59.210 --> 02:29:02.180
<v Speaker 5>I think Jack Black was getting shame.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's got one of those Farrah Fawcett</v>

3067

<v Speaker 5>a tree.</v>

<v Speaker 5>This is like a rap rapping that sounded</v>

3089
02:29:53.031 --> 02:29:54.680
<v Speaker 5>like this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The new album.</v>

3094
02:30:04.820 --> 02:30:09.820
<v Speaker 5>that he's actually taken apart.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is the snow in the video.</v>

<v Speaker 5>It says it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

<v Speaker 4>family and gifts.</v>

3124
02:31:40.950 --> 02:31:45.690
<v Speaker 4>Soon though it may be available to my</v>
<v Speaker 4>followers as we test recipes and opened</v>

3125
02:31:45.691 --> 02:31:46.590
<v Speaker 4>up to market.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God,</v>

02:31:46.591 --> 02:31:51.210
<v Speaker 4>he's got a murder animals for a living.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got to get some things dialed in</v>

3127
02:31:51.211 --> 02:31:53.370
<v Speaker 4>first,</v>
<v Speaker 4>including murder,</v>

3128
02:31:54.630 --> 02:31:57.210
<v Speaker 4>murder of sheep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just kidding.</v>

3129
02:31:57.390 --> 02:31:58.840
<v Speaker 4>Like he is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I eat meat,</v>

3130
02:31:59.930 --> 02:32:03.690
<v Speaker 4>but that's a glorious how get the balls</v>
<v Speaker 4>in this guy.</v>

3131
02:32:03.870 --> 02:32:08.610
<v Speaker 4>When has a a list actor ever considered</v>
<v Speaker 4>opening?</v>

3132
02:32:08.611 --> 02:32:12.090
<v Speaker 4>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A meat shop and showed a photo on his</v>

3133
02:32:12.091 --> 02:32:16.500
<v Speaker 4>instagram of the honest procurement of</v>
<v Speaker 4>meat in an honest way.</v>

3134
02:32:16.640 --> 02:32:19.610
<v Speaker 4>Did you see that post I made today?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

3135
02:32:19.690 --> 02:32:20.523
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Which one?</v>

3136
02:32:20.550 --> 02:32:22.680
<v Speaker 7>My,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I have my airplane mode on so I can't</v>

3137
02:32:22.681 --> 02:32:23.760
<v Speaker 7>post it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But I think,</v>

3138
02:32:23.761 --> 02:32:26.070
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I made a post,</v>

3139
02:32:26.310 --> 02:32:28.710
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it was a google search that I did.</v>

3140
02:32:30.560 --> 02:32:35.530
<v Speaker 7>There was 21 independent,</v>
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

3141
02:32:35.660 --> 02:32:40.660
<v Speaker 7>legitimate scientists that found that if</v>
<v Speaker 7>you ate 50 grams of processed meat per</v>

3142
02:32:42.621 --> 02:32:47.000
<v Speaker 7>day,</v>
<v Speaker 7>your chance of cancer was 18% higher.</v>

3143
02:32:47.450 --> 02:32:48.380
<v Speaker 7>Holy Shit.</v>

3144
02:32:50.410 --> 02:32:53.470
<v Speaker 4>Just think of that number now is at</v>
<v Speaker 4>night nitrites.</v>

3145
02:32:53.471 --> 02:32:54.350
<v Speaker 4>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What are the,</v>

3146
02:32:54.351 --> 02:32:55.700
<v Speaker 4>what are they thinking?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's causing that.</v>

3147
02:32:56.980 --> 02:33:00.370
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That part wasn't clearly defined,</v>

3148
02:33:00.371 --> 02:33:03.520
<v Speaker 7>but I would definitely think it was</v>
<v Speaker 7>preserved based,</v>

3149
02:33:03.610 --> 02:33:04.040
<v Speaker 7>but</v>

3150
02:33:04.040 --> 02:33:05.210
<v Speaker 4>they don't really know though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3151
02:33:05.510 --> 02:33:08.150
<v Speaker 4>They know it's processed meat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's really dangerous.</v>

3152
02:33:08.420 --> 02:33:10.160
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't know what it is exactly.</v>

3153
02:33:10.390 --> 02:33:11.223
<v Speaker 4>That's what right.</v>

3154
02:33:11.320 --> 02:33:16.320
<v Speaker 7>Awesome about how you and I hunt.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I posted it specifically to actually</v>

3155
02:33:16.361 --> 02:33:19.960
<v Speaker 7>some access backstraps from Hawaii last</v>
<v Speaker 7>year.</v>

3156
02:33:20.740 --> 02:33:22.900
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>because I think,</v>

3157
02:33:23.920 --> 02:33:28.920
<v Speaker 7>I think it's maybe ignorant for people</v>
<v Speaker 7>to automatically make a post saying,</v>

3158
02:33:30.850 --> 02:33:33.820
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you're a killer just because you post a</v>

3159
02:33:33.821 --> 02:33:35.170
<v Speaker 7>picture of,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3160
02:33:35.171 --> 02:33:38.230
<v Speaker 7>free range,</v>
<v Speaker 7>organic meat that you decided to choose</v>

3161
02:33:38.231 --> 02:33:40.300
<v Speaker 7>a touch.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

3162
02:33:40.740 --> 02:33:42.050
<v Speaker 4>look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know what you're saying,</v>

3163
02:33:42.051 --> 02:33:43.490
<v Speaker 4>but you got to look at it from their</v>
<v Speaker 4>perspective.</v>

3164
02:33:43.530 --> 02:33:45.260
<v Speaker 4>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even if they're not right,</v>

3165
02:33:45.740 --> 02:33:49.040
<v Speaker 4>and there's no right here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The thing is there's there,</v>

3166
02:33:49.041 --> 02:33:50.060
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you're right,</v>

3167
02:33:50.300 --> 02:33:53.210
<v Speaker 4>it's everybody's right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's this really what's fucked up about</v>

3168
02:33:53.211 --> 02:33:55.490
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like an animal does have to die.</v>

3169
02:33:55.940 --> 02:33:57.470
<v Speaker 4>You know it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is a fact.</v>

3170
02:33:57.620 --> 02:34:01.370
<v Speaker 4>And that does bother people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>including you and me when it happens.</v>

3171
02:34:01.420 --> 02:34:03.740
<v Speaker 4>And people don't realize that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that is true.</v>

3172
02:34:03.800 --> 02:34:04.940
<v Speaker 4>They don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the,</v>

3173
02:34:06.380 --> 02:34:10.640
<v Speaker 4>the understanding at the end of the day</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that this is the cycle of life and</v>

3174
02:34:10.641 --> 02:34:13.490
<v Speaker 4>this is what life is really all about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they're right in your right,</v>

3175
02:34:13.491 --> 02:34:15.980
<v Speaker 4>but this whole,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this expression of outrage,</v>

3176
02:34:16.040 --> 02:34:17.980
<v Speaker 4>like you should be expressing that at</v>

3177
02:34:17.980 --> 02:34:19.510
<v Speaker 1>Burger King.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should be,</v>

3178
02:34:19.540 --> 02:34:22.000
<v Speaker 1>and not Burger King,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

3179
02:34:22.060 --> 02:34:23.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not singling them out.</v>

3180
02:34:23.920 --> 02:34:27.310
<v Speaker 1>Anybody that has fast food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I've eaten many times.</v>

3181
02:34:27.380 --> 02:34:29.710
<v Speaker 1>If you want to live in a society of 20</v>
<v Speaker 1>million people,</v>

3182
02:34:29.860 --> 02:34:33.430
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have to live in a place</v>
<v Speaker 1>most likely with this model where you've</v>

3183
02:34:33.431 --> 02:34:35.860
<v Speaker 1>got in and out Burger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I like in and out Burger.</v>

3184
02:34:35.890 --> 02:34:37.030
<v Speaker 1>I like them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They taste good,</v>

3185
02:34:37.150 --> 02:34:38.650
<v Speaker 1>but go ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We went there in Vegas,</v>

3186
02:34:38.920 --> 02:34:40.060
<v Speaker 1>they've got damn good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3187
02:34:40.510 --> 02:34:44.170
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to beat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I don't necessarily hate those</v>

3188
02:34:44.171 --> 02:34:46.840
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you have to understand what all this</v>

3189
02:34:46.841 --> 02:34:48.460
<v Speaker 1>really is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

3190
02:34:48.490 --> 02:34:52.360
<v Speaker 1>It's the whole thing is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're here for a very short period of</v>

3191
02:34:52.361 --> 02:34:53.800
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as are these animals.</v>

3192
02:34:53.980 --> 02:34:56.740
<v Speaker 1>All of us are trying to stay alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of us are freaking out.</v>

3193
02:34:56.741 --> 02:34:59.380
<v Speaker 1>One of the things get eaten and we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>all just going like,</v>

3194
02:34:59.530 --> 02:35:01.360
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just want to be the best version of</v>

3195
02:35:01.361 --> 02:35:01.600
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

3196
02:35:01.600 --> 02:35:04.360
<v Speaker 1>I can be your right hand there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3197
02:35:04.780 --> 02:35:08.050
<v Speaker 1>They just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they haven't experienced what they,</v>

3198
02:35:08.110 --> 02:35:10.690
<v Speaker 1>they have decided that an animal should</v>
<v Speaker 1>not die.</v>

3199
02:35:11.170 --> 02:35:13.480
<v Speaker 1>There's no way an animal should die so</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they can live,</v>

3200
02:35:13.481 --> 02:35:15.850
<v Speaker 1>and if they can live that way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's their choice.</v>

3201
02:35:16.090 --> 02:35:20.020
<v Speaker 1>They're welcome to that choice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just don't understand the merit of</v>

3202
02:35:20.021 --> 02:35:23.740
<v Speaker 1>your choice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The merit of your choice is just</v>

3203
02:35:23.741 --> 02:35:27.910
<v Speaker 1>diametrically opposed to what they think</v>
<v Speaker 1>should be and should not be a thing a</v>

3204
02:35:27.911 --> 02:35:30.190
<v Speaker 1>person does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You shouldn't be a person that kills</v>

3205
02:35:30.191 --> 02:35:33.170
<v Speaker 1>animals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you're engulfed in that world,</v>

3206
02:35:33.171 --> 02:35:34.750
<v Speaker 1>when you're living in the woods,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're,</v>

3207
02:35:34.810 --> 02:35:37.630
<v Speaker 1>when you're going through these seven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eight,</v>

3208
02:35:37.631 --> 02:35:38.560
<v Speaker 1>nine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 day hunts,</v>

3209
02:35:38.561 --> 02:35:42.040
<v Speaker 1>you give us understanding of what this</v>
<v Speaker 1>world around these things.</v>

3210
02:35:42.041 --> 02:35:44.470
<v Speaker 1>It really is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's this crazy,</v>

3211
02:35:44.471 --> 02:35:48.250
<v Speaker 1>beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>complex interaction between Predator and</v>

3212
02:35:48.251 --> 02:35:50.650
<v Speaker 1>prey and it's been going on since life</v>
<v Speaker 1>was here.</v>

3213
02:35:50.720 --> 02:35:53.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just what it is and what you're doing as</v>

3214
02:35:53.051 --> 02:35:57.550
<v Speaker 1>a hunter is just figuring out with your</v>
<v Speaker 1>soft bitch ass skin and you're,</v>

3215
02:35:57.551 --> 02:36:02.551
<v Speaker 1>you're fucking shaky knees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bad ankles weasely yourself into a</v>

3216
02:36:02.561 --> 02:36:07.090
<v Speaker 1>position where you can jump into the</v>
<v Speaker 1>food chain with wolves around that</v>

3217
02:36:07.120 --> 02:36:09.880
<v Speaker 1>fucking conversation that we had about</v>
<v Speaker 1>wolves.</v>

3218
02:36:10.060 --> 02:36:14.230
<v Speaker 1>Did that change people's understanding</v>
<v Speaker 1>of what a wolf is when on the first time</v>

3219
02:36:14.231 --> 02:36:16.150
<v Speaker 1>you came on the podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you talked about how the wolves to try</v>

3220
02:36:16.151 --> 02:36:16.720
<v Speaker 1>and take your</v>

3221
02:36:16.720 --> 02:36:19.010
<v Speaker 2>away from you too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a crazy story.</v>

3222
02:36:19.420 --> 02:36:20.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3223
02:36:20.361 --> 02:36:22.490
<v Speaker 2>there are my all time favorite stories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3224
02:36:22.491 --> 02:36:24.230
<v Speaker 2>There at camp,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3225
02:36:25.700 --> 02:36:27.980
<v Speaker 2>there's an interaction going on Predator</v>
<v Speaker 2>and prey.</v>

3226
02:36:28.340 --> 02:36:29.950
<v Speaker 2>This is happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your name.</v>

3227
02:36:31.160 --> 02:36:34.190
<v Speaker 2>It's not like it's established and it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>written in stone.</v>

3228
02:36:35.060 --> 02:36:39.950
<v Speaker 2>Every level of the food chain is being</v>
<v Speaker 2>competitive with the next.</v>

3229
02:36:39.980 --> 02:36:42.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like it is a very clear cut</v>

3230
02:36:43.010 --> 02:36:46.670
<v Speaker 2>concrete step to where every step is</v>
<v Speaker 2>clear.</v>

3231
02:36:47.120 --> 02:36:49.490
<v Speaker 2>Humans are here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wolves are here,</v>

3232
02:36:49.550 --> 02:36:52.580
<v Speaker 2>grizzlies are here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>access deer here.</v>

3233
02:36:52.610 --> 02:36:55.490
<v Speaker 2>Turkeys are here and I would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would inject one other thing.</v>

3234
02:36:55.550 --> 02:36:58.330
<v Speaker 2>Cwd Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chronic wasting diseases.</v>

3235
02:36:58.340 --> 02:37:01.280
<v Speaker 2>Kill study biology comes into this</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

3236
02:37:02.210 --> 02:37:02.920
<v Speaker 2>Diseases is</v>

3237
02:37:02.920 --> 02:37:07.120
<v Speaker 1>are creeping in and killing deer left</v>
<v Speaker 1>and right and a lot of people feel like</v>

3238
02:37:07.121 --> 02:37:10.390
<v Speaker 1>these diseases were created by people</v>
<v Speaker 1>farming those deal.</v>

3239
02:37:10.640 --> 02:37:15.640
<v Speaker 1>It was dear taking them out of the wild</v>
<v Speaker 1>environments and letting them like eat</v>

3240
02:37:15.801 --> 02:37:16.020
<v Speaker 1>off</v>

3241
02:37:16.020 --> 02:37:20.720
<v Speaker 4>the same food and constantly exchange</v>
<v Speaker 4>bacteria with each other and that's what</v>

3242
02:37:20.721 --> 02:37:21.554
<v Speaker 4>created this thing.</v>

3243
02:37:21.810 --> 02:37:24.540
<v Speaker 7>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I've told people metro times that I feel</v>

3244
02:37:24.541 --> 02:37:29.541
<v Speaker 7>like mother nature is a form of Karma.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think Mother Nature will take care of</v>

3245
02:37:31.531 --> 02:37:36.531
<v Speaker 7>herself.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think as things below that level,</v>

3246
02:37:37.260 --> 02:37:42.260
<v Speaker 7>try to occupy their own status.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think that's the balance.</v>

3247
02:37:42.721 --> 02:37:46.500
<v Speaker 7>That's a check that's in process.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think Mother Nature,</v>

3248
02:37:46.501 --> 02:37:50.160
<v Speaker 7>naturally,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think if you decide I'm not going to</v>

3249
02:37:50.161 --> 02:37:53.190
<v Speaker 7>shoot any turkeys,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm going to just let these turkeys go</v>

3250
02:37:53.360 --> 02:37:56.850
<v Speaker 7>as wild as they can.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think all sudden mother nature comes</v>

3251
02:37:56.851 --> 02:37:58.440
<v Speaker 7>in and says,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

3252
02:37:58.800 --> 02:38:02.310
<v Speaker 7>I'm going to throw a little trump card</v>
<v Speaker 7>in here called black heads disease.</v>

3253
02:38:03.170 --> 02:38:07.830
<v Speaker 7>This is going to kill every freaking</v>
<v Speaker 7>Turkey in your area and I'm going to</v>

3254
02:38:07.831 --> 02:38:09.000
<v Speaker 7>regulate this</v>

3255
02:38:09.370 --> 02:38:11.590
<v Speaker 4>according fasting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Does that always happens?</v>

3256
02:38:11.860 --> 02:38:13.540
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When animals get over it and that's one</v>

3257
02:38:13.541 --> 02:38:15.900
<v Speaker 4>of the things and it's being concerned</v>
<v Speaker 4>about Hawaii,</v>

3258
02:38:15.930 --> 02:38:16.210
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3259
02:38:16.210 --> 02:38:17.700
<v Speaker 7>Disease.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yup.</v>

3260
02:38:17.950 --> 02:38:22.950
<v Speaker 7>And then you look at a white tail and</v>
<v Speaker 7>areas where maybe there's been,</v>

3261
02:38:23.650 --> 02:38:26.290
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I guess quote Unquote Trophy Hunters to</v>

3262
02:38:26.291 --> 02:38:29.740
<v Speaker 7>where they've not really,</v>
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

3263
02:38:31.870 --> 02:38:36.790
<v Speaker 7>I guess regulated the population of</v>
<v Speaker 7>Whitetail deer to point where,</v>

3264
02:38:36.810 --> 02:38:38.980
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they're trying to grow trophy hunting.</v>

3265
02:38:39.430 --> 02:38:42.920
<v Speaker 7>So to me to try and grow a deer with</v>
<v Speaker 7>large animals,</v>

3266
02:38:42.950 --> 02:38:46.060
<v Speaker 7>larger antlers.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So there may be shooting less numbers</v>

3267
02:38:46.120 --> 02:38:50.050
<v Speaker 7>and then all of a sudden here comes this</v>
<v Speaker 7>little thing called Ehd,</v>

3268
02:38:50.080 --> 02:38:53.230
<v Speaker 7>which kills every whitetail.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It goes to drink water.</v>

3269
02:38:53.800 --> 02:38:56.720
<v Speaker 7>I don't know it,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it is chronic wasting disease.</v>

3270
02:38:56.780 --> 02:39:01.210
<v Speaker 7>EAC is different.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's an image that actually lives in the</v>

3271
02:39:01.211 --> 02:39:04.690
<v Speaker 7>mud.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm on the receiving water line on a</v>

3272
02:39:04.691 --> 02:39:06.300
<v Speaker 7>pond.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So as a,</v>

3273
02:39:06.700 --> 02:39:09.370
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>as a whitetail deer would go into</v>

3274
02:39:09.400 --> 02:39:11.800
<v Speaker 7>actually drink,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

3275
02:39:11.830 --> 02:39:16.830
<v Speaker 7>this mitch fly lives in the,</v>
<v Speaker 7>in the soil on the re the receding</v>

3276
02:39:17.580 --> 02:39:21.070
<v Speaker 7>waterline,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and it would go into the nostril of the</v>

3277
02:39:21.071 --> 02:39:25.420
<v Speaker 7>deer and then literally within 48 hours,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that deer's debt,</v>

3278
02:39:25.930 --> 02:39:27.520
<v Speaker 7>if it,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if it gets that,</v>

3279
02:39:27.790 --> 02:39:29.770
<v Speaker 4>that virus,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look at the name of it.</v>

3280
02:39:30.250 --> 02:39:34.740
<v Speaker 4>Epic Zoo,</v>
<v Speaker 4>epizootic hemorrhagic disease and you</v>

3281
02:39:34.741 --> 02:39:37.060
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it's like an ebola type disease.</v>

3282
02:39:37.061 --> 02:39:40.930
<v Speaker 4>I think a bowl is that Ebola hemalogic</v>
<v Speaker 4>disease.</v>

3283
02:39:41.850 --> 02:39:43.680
<v Speaker 4>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>didn't have to pee so hard.</v>

<v Speaker 4>This is awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We've had a,</v>

3286
02:39:47.900 --> 02:39:50.570
<v Speaker 4>I did I pee before the trial.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a different suit.</v>

3287
02:39:50.580 --> 02:39:52.210
<v Speaker 4>Wolves and coyotes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I saw that picture.</v>

3288

02:40:54.051 --> 02:40:58.160
<v Speaker 7>Jamie's actually told me earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he's trying to make a profession out of</v>

3313
02:40:58.310 --> 02:41:01.260
<v Speaker 7>video gaming,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which I would know about refreshing,</v>

3314
02:41:01.310 --> 02:41:03.740
<v Speaker 7>but a,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I stream from time to time on twitch,</v>

3315
02:41:03.770 --> 02:41:07.580
<v Speaker 7>which is an interesting thing that you</v>
<v Speaker 7>said your son does it a little bit or he</v>

3316
02:41:07.581 --> 02:41:08.600
<v Speaker 7>looks at it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

3317
02:41:09.020 --> 02:41:10.580
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I used to play quite a bit.</v>

3318
02:41:10.830 --> 02:41:11.600
<v Speaker 7>Our,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

3319
02:41:11.600 --> 02:41:16.280
<v Speaker 7>we had two accounts.</v>
<v Speaker 7>One was death by Dudley on playstation.</v>

3320
02:41:16.760 --> 02:41:17.570
<v Speaker 7>And,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

3321
02:41:17.570 --> 02:41:19.820
<v Speaker 7>the other one was bald,</v>
<v Speaker 7>hairless Yeti.</v>

3322
02:41:21.340 --> 02:41:23.870
<v Speaker 7>He playing with them like you guys play</v>
<v Speaker 7>at times?</v>

3323
02:41:23.871 --> 02:41:24.681
<v Speaker 7>We did.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

3324
02:41:24.681 --> 02:41:27.600
<v Speaker 7>We were big modern warfare guys.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

3325
02:41:27.620 --> 02:41:30.890
<v Speaker 7>we really liked that and actually I met,</v>
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

3326
02:41:31.400 --> 02:41:35.420
<v Speaker 7>I met several cool dudes during that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>during that,</v>

3327
02:41:35.421 --> 02:41:37.040
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>online play.</v>

3328
02:41:37.820 --> 02:41:38.810
<v Speaker 7>I always,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3329
02:41:38.840 --> 02:41:43.840
<v Speaker 7>honestly I felt like if I was a</v>
<v Speaker 7>competitive archer and I would have been</v>

3330
02:41:45.860 --> 02:41:50.860
<v Speaker 7>online prior to my competition,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I feel like I almost could have helped</v>

3331
02:41:51.950 --> 02:41:56.950
<v Speaker 7>some of my performance anxiety when it</v>
<v Speaker 7>comes to competition because there's so</v>

3332
02:41:58.071 --> 02:42:02.180
<v Speaker 7>many.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You get so like into beating the guy</v>

3333
02:42:02.181 --> 02:42:06.890
<v Speaker 7>that you're going against that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you can almost freak out and you don't</v>

3334
02:42:06.891 --> 02:42:10.820
<v Speaker 7>do things according to a systematic</v>
<v Speaker 7>method,</v>

3335
02:42:10.850 --> 02:42:15.850
<v Speaker 7>which is really all a video game is,</v>
<v Speaker 7>is it's if you follow the systematic</v>

3336
02:42:16.581 --> 02:42:19.910
<v Speaker 7>method,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you can overcome the alley algorithm.</v>

3337
02:42:19.911 --> 02:42:20.744
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>For sure.</v>

3338
02:42:21.150 --> 02:42:22.470
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but</v>

3339
02:42:26.170 --> 02:42:28.680
<v Speaker 5>here it goes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was rough.</v>

3340
02:42:28.730 --> 02:42:30.280
<v Speaker 5>How was full of those?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3341
02:42:31.110 --> 02:42:32.250

<v Speaker 5>Whatever you talked about.</v>

<v Speaker 5>That was crazy.</v>

3346
02:42:41.881 --> 02:42:46.140
<v Speaker 5>I was talking about her.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I talked about my two online video</v>

3347

<v Speaker 5>gaming accounts with,</v>
<v Speaker 5>with my little dude,</v>

3349
02:42:52.981 --> 02:42:54.060
<v Speaker 5>one was bald.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hairless.</v>

3350
02:42:54.061 --> 02:42:54.720
<v Speaker 5>She,</v>

3351
02:42:54.720 --> 02:42:58.890

<v Speaker 5>Mainly a modern warfare stuff.</v>

3352
02:42:59.040 --> 02:43:01.890
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Anything that you kill someone.</v>

3353
02:43:02.490 --> 02:43:06.480
<v Speaker 5>Sadly enough.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Go get you your and on me and I'm young.</v>

3354
02:43:06.481 --> 02:43:08.280
<v Speaker 5>Jane will talk about the implications to</v>
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

3355
02:43:08.281 --> 02:43:10.020
<v Speaker 5>Let's hear about this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What is this?</v>

3356
02:43:10.650 --> 02:43:13.780
<v Speaker 5>What is it about these?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have three coffees.</v>

3357
02:43:13.870 --> 02:43:15.550
<v Speaker 5>That's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a lot of caffeine.</v>

3358
02:43:15.760 --> 02:43:17.260
<v Speaker 5>Thank God you've got that whiskey.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's dumb.</v>

3359
02:43:17.261 --> 02:43:20.260
<v Speaker 5>It down balances.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Perfect.</v>

3360
02:43:20.261 --> 02:43:21.460
<v Speaker 5>You'd be talking to how to control</v>

3361
02:43:24.590 --> 02:43:28.020
<v Speaker 1>it was one of the drunk or podcasts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of them.</v>

3362
02:43:28.200 --> 02:43:31.320
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's something fun about getting</v>

3363
02:43:31.321 --> 02:43:34.620
<v Speaker 1>together with a really good friend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just getting lit up.</v>

3364
02:43:34.770 --> 02:43:37.170
<v Speaker 1>Smoke a little weed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>drink a little whiskey.</v>

3365
02:43:37.320 --> 02:43:39.870
<v Speaker 1>It's have a good time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just have a good time.</v>

3366
02:43:39.900 --> 02:43:43.020
<v Speaker 1>Today's been a good time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That guy's a good guy.</v>

3367
02:43:43.620 --> 02:43:45.960
<v Speaker 1>John Dudley's a fucking good man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love that guy.</v>

3368
02:43:46.440 --> 02:43:51.440
<v Speaker 1>He's fun and he's also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a master at something that's very</v>

3369
02:43:51.721 --> 02:43:53.520
<v Speaker 1>difficult to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a master,</v>

3370
02:43:53.521 --> 02:43:56.850
<v Speaker 1>not just at like executing archery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but instructing it,</v>

3371
02:43:57.330 --> 02:44:00.750
<v Speaker 1>teaching people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a fascinating thing that archery</v>

3372
02:44:00.751 --> 02:44:04.200
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to me it's super important and I think</v>

3373
02:44:04.201 --> 02:44:07.230
<v Speaker 1>that everybody goes to these like things</v>
<v Speaker 1>where like what's important to them,</v>

3374
02:44:07.231 --> 02:44:09.660
<v Speaker 1>like to you might be a guitar amp,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3375
02:44:09.670 --> 02:44:14.190
<v Speaker 1>might be a certain drums,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a drum sticks.</v>

3376
02:44:14.191 --> 02:44:16.650
<v Speaker 1>It might be whatever the fuck you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>into,</v>

3377
02:44:16.860 --> 02:44:18.390
<v Speaker 1>you know that might be important to you.</v>

3378
02:44:20.070 --> 02:44:24.300
<v Speaker 1>But archery I think is one of those</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that most people miss.</v>

3379
02:44:24.690 --> 02:44:26.220
<v Speaker 1>You just don't get a chance at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

3380
02:44:26.221 --> 02:44:27.090
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that looks good.</v>

3381
02:44:27.690 --> 02:44:29.520
<v Speaker 1>That looks like it'd be fun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't know where to go.</v>

3382
02:44:29.760 --> 02:44:33.060
<v Speaker 1>And you never do it like by far most</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

3383
02:44:33.990 --> 02:44:35.700
<v Speaker 1>But once you do do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you realize like,</v>

3384
02:44:35.760 --> 02:44:38.340
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can learn about life through this</v>

3385
02:44:38.341 --> 02:44:41.670
<v Speaker 1>weird thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm pulling that string back and I'm</v>

3386
02:44:41.671 --> 02:44:45.060
<v Speaker 1>launching a pointed stick at a target</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm learning about myself.</v>

3387
02:44:45.061 --> 02:44:50.061
<v Speaker 1>Like what I'm learning about how I deal</v>
<v Speaker 1>with situations where I have to execute</v>

3388
02:44:51.361 --> 02:44:55.620
<v Speaker 1>correctly under pressure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if it's just a minor pressure of</v>

3389
02:44:55.621 --> 02:44:58.620
<v Speaker 1>hitting a target or the major pressure</v>
<v Speaker 1>of hitting an animal.</v>

3390
02:44:59.010 --> 02:45:00.240
<v Speaker 1>He learned to that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie,</v>

3391
02:45:01.350 --> 02:45:02.183
<v Speaker 1>what are you showing me?</v>

3392
02:45:02.660 --> 02:45:04.870
<v Speaker 5>There's this game.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I feel like we've,</v>

3393
02:45:05.030 --> 02:45:08.180
<v Speaker 5>I showed this to you awhile ago,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but this is called the hunter call of</v>

3394
02:45:08.181 --> 02:45:11.090
<v Speaker 5>the wild.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Should we tell people archery part of</v>

3395
02:45:11.091 --> 02:45:11.750
<v Speaker 5>it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Should we tell,</v>

3396
02:45:11.750 --> 02:45:13.740
<v Speaker 5>oh damn.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a compound bow it.</v>

3397
02:45:13.760 --> 02:45:14.660
<v Speaker 5>Who's got a real bow?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3398
02:45:14.750 --> 02:45:16.430
<v Speaker 5>Why has he goes sideways like he's</v>
<v Speaker 5>Gangsta?</v>

3399
02:45:16.440 --> 02:45:18.820
<v Speaker 5>I'd probably say you can see,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I bet even once you pull it up to aim,</v>

3400
02:45:18.860 --> 02:45:20.790
<v Speaker 5>he better,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so I'm hoping I can get you better pull</v>

3401
02:45:20.800 --> 02:45:21.890
<v Speaker 5>it back.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

3402
02:45:21.891 --> 02:45:22.880
<v Speaker 5>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wow,</v>

3403
02:45:22.881 --> 02:45:25.340
<v Speaker 5>that's legit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look at this John Dudley,</v>

3404
02:45:25.341 --> 02:45:27.020
<v Speaker 5>this gundam archery video game</v>

3405
02:45:27.190 --> 02:45:31.300
<v Speaker 1>guys pulling back a bow and looking</v>
<v Speaker 1>through a site like you would like a</v>

3406
02:45:31.301 --> 02:45:33.550
<v Speaker 1>real compound bow site.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing</v>

3407
02:45:34.450 --> 02:45:37.930
<v Speaker 5>with the whisker biscuit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>powerful whisker biscuit and then you go</v>

3408
02:45:37.931 --> 02:45:39.210
<v Speaker 5>home.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A lot of people still rocket.</v>

3409
02:45:40.270 --> 02:45:42.880
<v Speaker 5>A lot of people still rock the bus</v>
<v Speaker 5>about,</v>

3410
02:45:43.630 --> 02:45:46.300
<v Speaker 5>I wish the biscuit was in fallible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wish it was.</v>

3411
02:45:46.301 --> 02:45:48.310
<v Speaker 5>The way to go.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Seems so easy.</v>

3412
02:45:48.670 --> 02:45:50.560
<v Speaker 5>I just hate the name.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

3413
02:45:50.561 --> 02:45:51.760
<v Speaker 5>Your biscuit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3414
02:45:51.761 --> 02:45:55.240
<v Speaker 5>I mean I hate it but it's definitely</v>
<v Speaker 5>provocative.</v>

3415
02:45:55.330 --> 02:45:56.590
<v Speaker 5>People don't know what we're talking</v>
<v Speaker 5>about.</v>

3416
02:45:56.591 --> 02:46:00.100
<v Speaker 5>It's the Arrow go.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Some people definitely do.</v>

3417
02:46:00.130 --> 02:46:02.440
<v Speaker 5>Most people don't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Most people listen to this podcast,</v>

3418
02:46:02.441 --> 02:46:04.690
<v Speaker 5>probably don't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a type of archery rest where that</v>

3419
02:46:04.720 --> 02:46:06.880
<v Speaker 5>Arrow sits.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's very controversial.</v>

3420
02:46:07.000 --> 02:46:10.100
<v Speaker 5>This is how geeky archery is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's very controversial.</v>

3421
02:46:10.101 --> 02:46:14.090
<v Speaker 5>Should you have some fine mesh that's</v>
<v Speaker 5>sort of cradles the Arrow and that</v>

3422
02:46:14.091 --> 02:46:19.091
<v Speaker 5>fledglings will pass through that five</v>
<v Speaker 5>mesh possibly knocking down how many</v>

3423
02:46:19.221 --> 02:46:21.190
<v Speaker 5>feet per second?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Five.</v>

3424
02:46:21.270 --> 02:46:23.910
<v Speaker 5>I'm five feet paws.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Three.</v>

3425
02:46:23.930 --> 02:46:27.740
<v Speaker 5>Five scientific.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't do that so we'll be stuck in an</v>

3426
02:46:27.750 --> 02:46:32.480
<v Speaker 5>hour so we'll be real conservative and</v>

3427
02:46:32.510 --> 02:46:34.790
<v Speaker 5>three feet a second,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is pretty probably knocks off more</v>

3428
02:46:34.791 --> 02:46:37.040
<v Speaker 5>than that but some people like it</v>
<v Speaker 5>because of its simplicity.</v>

3429
02:46:37.070 --> 02:46:39.930
<v Speaker 5>There it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a whisker biscuit and the</v>

3430
02:46:39.950 --> 02:46:43.730
<v Speaker 5>fletching is a pass through.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Those fine fibers slow down a little bit</v>

3431
02:46:43.731 --> 02:46:47.210
<v Speaker 5>but not too much.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's literally like training wheels</v>

<v Speaker 5>thing where they have an arrow rest that</v>
<v Speaker 5>drops down.</v>

<v Speaker 7>person.</v>

3447
02:47:38.580 --> 02:47:43.580

02:54:17.560 --> 02:54:20.320
<v Speaker 5>You have a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a cultural issue that's a cultural</v>

3566
02:54:20.321 --> 02:54:22.150
<v Speaker 5>issue.</v>

3572
02:54:39.130 --> 02:54:41.290
<v Speaker 5>I think this is what happens with</v>
<v Speaker 5>people,</v>

3573
02:54:41.291 --> 02:54:45.190
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

<v Speaker 1>How old are they have to be?</v>

3585
02:55:18.700 --> 02:55:21.230
<v Speaker 1>Is there an age limit at all or is it</v>
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

<v Speaker 1>It does,</v>

3591
02:55:31.960 --> 02:55:34.990
<v Speaker 1>but here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you pay attention to history or if</v>

3592
02:55:34.991 --> 02:55:37.690
<v Speaker 1>you read anything about the atrocities</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

3593
02:55:37.840 --> 02:55:39.680
<v Speaker 1>why don't we learn?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3594
02:55:39.730 --> 02:55:42.550
<v Speaker 1>we got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have learned a little at what point</v>

3595
02:55:42.770 --> 02:55:43.810
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

3596
02:55:44.410 --> 02:55:46.390
<v Speaker 1>we're better than we were a hundred</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>

3597
02:55:46.630 --> 02:55:49.000
<v Speaker 1>Better than we were 200 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But</v>

3598
02:55:49.500 --> 02:55:49.770
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

3599
02:55:49.770 --> 02:55:52.230
<v Speaker 1>in the past it was like really</v>
<v Speaker 1>commonplace.</v>

3600
02:55:52.650 --> 02:55:53.483
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

3601
02:55:53.650 --> 02:55:56.820
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you read anything about</v>
<v Speaker 1>socrates or anything about Plato,</v>

3602
02:55:56.821 --> 02:56:01.380
<v Speaker 1>like that time of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like men having sex with children and</v>

3603
02:56:01.420 --> 02:56:04.590
<v Speaker 1>little boys and stuff was like extremely</v>
<v Speaker 1>common.</v>

3604
02:56:05.040 --> 02:56:06.420
<v Speaker 1>Extremely common.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

3605
02:56:06.570 --> 02:56:07.403
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3606
02:56:07.780 --> 02:56:08.020
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

3607
02:56:08.020 --> 02:56:09.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And parts of the world.</v>

3608
02:56:09.221 --> 02:56:13.270
<v Speaker 1>Men having sex with boys was extremely</v>
<v Speaker 1>common for humans.</v>

3609
02:56:13.450 --> 02:56:18.450
<v Speaker 1>Even in like what we would consider like</v>
<v Speaker 1>classical cultural culture,</v>

3610
02:56:19.660 --> 02:56:22.750
<v Speaker 1>intelligent civilizations like the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ancient Romans,</v>

3611
02:56:22.751 --> 02:56:26.320
<v Speaker 1>the ancient Greeks that like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a normal part of life.</v>

3612
02:56:26.800 --> 02:56:28.390
<v Speaker 1>It's really weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3613
02:56:28.391 --> 02:56:32.590
<v Speaker 1>we'd want to deny that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's undeniable proof that that's</v>

3614
02:56:32.591 --> 02:56:36.970
<v Speaker 1>a fact that it's w it was way more</v>
<v Speaker 1>common in those ancient cultures than it</v>

3615
02:56:36.971 --> 02:56:38.740
<v Speaker 1>is today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what is that like,</v>

3616
02:56:38.741 --> 02:56:41.530
<v Speaker 1>how did that happen?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like why did people allow that?</v>

3617
02:56:41.770 --> 02:56:43.450
<v Speaker 1>Like why did that take place?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

3618
02:56:43.451 --> 02:56:44.800
<v Speaker 1>I think there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you freaking out over there,</v>

3619
02:56:44.810 --> 02:56:47.860
<v Speaker 1>take some dads need to step up and beat</v>
<v Speaker 1>some ass.</v>

3620
02:56:48.280 --> 02:56:51.310
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In 2005 the core DDI cuss,</v>

3621
02:56:51.311 --> 02:56:56.311
<v Speaker 1>say tion Frances highest criminal court</v>
<v Speaker 1>stipulated that coercion is presumed for</v>

3622
02:56:57.761 --> 02:57:02.761
<v Speaker 1>children at a very young age and quotes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's an outrageously blurry</v>

3623
02:57:03.431 --> 02:57:06.310
<v Speaker 1>formulation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That in practice has largely been</v>

3624
02:57:06.311 --> 02:57:11.311
<v Speaker 1>applied to children under six what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This leaves children above sex above six</v>

3625
02:57:13.061 --> 02:57:16.840
<v Speaker 1>years old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>six potentially considered not raped</v>

3626
02:57:17.440 --> 02:57:21.880
<v Speaker 1>when violence cannot be established.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It also allows the state of paralyzed</v>

3627
02:57:21.881 --> 02:57:26.881
<v Speaker 1>shock experienced by many victims and</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the more so children.</v>

3628
02:57:29.310 --> 02:57:29.670
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

3629
02:57:29.670 --> 02:57:32.220
<v Speaker 1>To equal consent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's terrifying.</v>

3630
02:57:32.780 --> 02:57:35.190
<v Speaker 1>That is ruth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this vikings,</v>

3631
02:57:35.550 --> 02:57:37.600

<v Speaker 1>barbarians.</v>

3632
02:57:37.880 --> 02:57:38.611
<v Speaker 1>And is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>

3633
02:57:38.611 --> 02:57:43.290
<v Speaker 1>this is ancient European barbarian law</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's in place for thousands of years</v>

3634
02:57:43.560 --> 02:57:45.780
<v Speaker 1>and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they never caught up.</v>

3635
02:57:45.880 --> 02:57:48.270
<v Speaker 1>They never refixed it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got to fix that.</v>

3636
02:57:48.360 --> 02:57:51.060
<v Speaker 1>This is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have the internet fix that.</v>

3637
02:57:51.210 --> 02:57:54.330
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could have sex with someone under</v>

3638
02:57:54.331 --> 02:57:56.940
<v Speaker 1>fucking nine or six or whatever the fuck</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was.</v>

3639

<v Speaker 1>That's nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3640
02:57:58.861 --> 02:58:00.260
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this isn't,</v>

3641
02:58:00.990 --> 02:58:02.580
<v Speaker 1>this isn't 16</v>

3642
02:58:02.580 --> 02:58:07.580
<v Speaker 2>two this is 2018 this is not the time</v>
<v Speaker 2>for that.</v>

3643
02:58:08.260 --> 02:58:10.620
<v Speaker 2>That it's amazing that this still</v>
<v Speaker 2>exists.</v>

3644
02:58:11.010 --> 02:58:12.600
<v Speaker 2>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In a,</v>

3645
02:58:12.601 --> 02:58:17.601
<v Speaker 2>in a European civilized,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it like really exalted culture like</v>

3646
02:58:19.651 --> 02:58:22.380
<v Speaker 2>France and people love the France.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's weird.</v>

3647
02:58:22.470 --> 02:58:27.000
<v Speaker 2>They fight so passionately about some</v>
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>

3648
02:58:27.180 --> 02:58:29.810
<v Speaker 2>but then they have something so stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they're,</v>

3649
02:58:29.811 --> 02:58:34.650
<v Speaker 2>they're just freer and a lot of ways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is bad and good at the same time.</v>

3650
02:58:35.190 --> 02:58:37.710
<v Speaker 2>It's bad in that regard of taking care</v>
<v Speaker 2>of children.</v>

3651
02:58:38.010 --> 02:58:40.170
<v Speaker 2>I'm like pr,</v>

3652
02:58:40.171 --> 02:58:42.750
<v Speaker 2>sexually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether you're just dooming them to this</v>

3653
02:58:42.751 --> 02:58:44.720
<v Speaker 2>life of weirdness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3654
02:58:45.150 --> 02:58:48.000
<v Speaker 2>and you're making it legal so there's no</v>
<v Speaker 2>legal recourse.</v>

3655
02:58:48.060 --> 02:58:52.290
<v Speaker 2>Some guy I've got fucked by some old</v>

<v Speaker 4>you have seven individual packages of</v>
<v Speaker 4>hundred pounds of meat.</v>

3773
03:04:23.301 --> 03:04:28.301
<v Speaker 4>You got to get out through miles and</v>
<v Speaker 4>miles and miles of dead falls and cliffy</v>

3774
03:04:28.791 --> 03:04:32.900
<v Speaker 4>rocky fucking you might get cliffed out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You might take a wrong path.</v>

3775
03:04:33.780 --> 03:04:34.660
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

<v Speaker 4>18.3 how about through 200 pounds on</v>

3778

<v Speaker 4>interview your town to the next.</v>

3779
03:04:47.930 --> 03:04:49.260
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When remy was telling you about it,</v>

3780
03:04:49.261 --> 03:04:49.940
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

3781
03:04:49.940 --> 03:04:52.040
<v Speaker 4>that sounds crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But like what?</v>

3782
03:04:52.490 --> 03:04:57.260
<v Speaker 4>Incredible mental fortitude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This guy had incredible mental fortitude</v>

3783
03:04:57.470 --> 03:05:01.490
<v Speaker 4>that he figured out how to get through</v>
<v Speaker 4>all the things that he said.</v>

3784
03:05:01.490 --> 03:05:03.170
<v Speaker 4>Fuck that meet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll leave it back there.</v>

3785
03:05:03.171 --> 03:05:04.970
<v Speaker 4>Some coyotes will eat it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who Cares?</v>

3786
03:05:05.150 --> 03:05:07.100
<v Speaker 4>It's not going to waste.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going back.</v>

3787
03:05:07.280 --> 03:05:09.500
<v Speaker 4>It's not worth it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He went back.</v>

3788
03:05:09.610 --> 03:05:11.510
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and over and over again.</v>

3789
03:05:11.511 --> 03:05:14.570
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to say it was three or four days</v>

3790
03:05:14.840 --> 03:05:17.060
<v Speaker 4>of packing out this Mousse.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3791
03:05:17.061 --> 03:05:21.080
<v Speaker 4>I bet that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the real western hunting that</v>

3792
03:05:21.081 --> 03:05:23.780
<v Speaker 4>people don't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't understand this.</v>

3793
03:05:23.781 --> 03:05:27.050
<v Speaker 4>This is not elmer fudd with an orange</v>
<v Speaker 4>jacket.</v>

3794
03:05:27.200 --> 03:05:28.990
<v Speaker 4>The shooting at deer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3795
03:05:29.130 --> 03:05:31.160
<v Speaker 4>hates animals.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is not that.</v>

3796
03:05:31.190 --> 03:05:36.190
<v Speaker 4>This is some crazy physical endeavor</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's highly difficult.</v>

3797
03:05:36.561 --> 03:05:40.730
<v Speaker 4>You need another one and another one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got one more drive in today.</v>

3798
03:05:40.970 --> 03:05:44.740
<v Speaker 4>It's two milligrams of caffeine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You've had more honestly,</v>

3799
03:05:44.770 --> 03:05:47.330
<v Speaker 4>thousand milligrams caffeine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Perfect.</v>

3800
03:05:47.380 --> 03:05:51.770
<v Speaker 4>I'm on par.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That right there is why hunters are</v>

3801
03:05:51.771 --> 03:05:56.690
<v Speaker 4>willing to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to argue with people that slam hunting</v>

3802
03:05:57.080 --> 03:05:58.640
<v Speaker 4>and say that we're just killers.</v>

3803
03:05:59.330 --> 03:06:04.330
<v Speaker 4>Because if you had to put 800 packs of</v>
<v Speaker 4>your ribeye steak on your back and walk</v>

3804
03:06:08.241 --> 03:06:13.241
<v Speaker 4>it five miles home,</v>
<v Speaker 4>would you feel more passionate about it?</v>

3805
03:06:13.910 --> 03:06:15.650
<v Speaker 4>Well that would be ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was still,</v>

3806
03:06:15.660 --> 03:06:18.440
<v Speaker 4>it was just do eight trips.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jesus Christ,</v>

3807
03:06:18.470 --> 03:06:20.480
<v Speaker 4>but it's trade a hundred pounds on your</v>
<v Speaker 4>back.</v>

3808
03:06:20.481 --> 03:06:22.550
<v Speaker 4>It seems excessive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's true.</v>

3809
03:06:22.551 --> 03:06:25.370
<v Speaker 4>I mean if you have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have a moose even enough,</v>

3810
03:06:25.430 --> 03:06:26.510
<v Speaker 4>that's not even enough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

3811
03:06:26.511 --> 03:06:28.700
<v Speaker 4>I don't think to really complete the</v>
<v Speaker 4>cycle.</v>

3812
03:06:28.940 --> 03:06:31.790
<v Speaker 4>I think you'd have to be there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You either have to be the one who pulls</v>

3813
03:06:31.791 --> 03:06:34.340
<v Speaker 4>the trigger or you have to be there when</v>
<v Speaker 4>it happens.</v>

3814
03:06:34.460 --> 03:06:37.190
<v Speaker 4>You have to see what the difference</v>
<v Speaker 4>between a living animal and dead animal.</v>

3815
03:06:37.340 --> 03:06:41.630
<v Speaker 4>Cause if you don't then you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're formulating your entire picture</v>

3816
03:06:41.631 --> 03:06:46.130
<v Speaker 4>of the world based on information that</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're only getting from a video.</v>

3817
03:06:46.310 --> 03:06:48.050
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like what we were talking about,</v>

3818
03:06:48.051 --> 03:06:51.140
<v Speaker 4>the difference between watching porn and</v>
<v Speaker 4>having sex.</v>

3819
03:06:51.230 --> 03:06:53.950
<v Speaker 4>It's really similar.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The difference between understanding</v>

3820
03:06:53.970 --> 03:06:56.130
<v Speaker 4>this in terms of like it on video</v>

3821
03:06:56.310 --> 03:06:59.220
<v Speaker 1>and actually being there like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh this is what it looks like when a cow</v>

3822
03:06:59.221 --> 03:07:00.520
<v Speaker 1>dies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what it looks like.</v>

3823
03:07:00.540 --> 03:07:04.080
<v Speaker 1>Me Hang Hangup by its ankles and gut it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is how I feel about this now.</v>

3824
03:07:04.230 --> 03:07:08.550
<v Speaker 1>I had one feeling about this before when</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was nicely insulated by all the</v>

3825
03:07:08.560 --> 03:07:11.730
<v Speaker 1>prides.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Got a nice white styrofoam little tray</v>

3826
03:07:11.731 --> 03:07:13.820
<v Speaker 1>with Saran wrap and a nice piece of rib</v>
<v Speaker 1>eye.</v>

3827
03:07:13.890 --> 03:07:16.770
<v Speaker 1>Oh look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to get the fucking briquettes</v>

3828
03:07:16.771 --> 03:07:19.020
<v Speaker 1>out there and start the grill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Woo.</v>

3829
03:07:19.050 --> 03:07:22.080
<v Speaker 1>You get all excited when it's not their</v>
<v Speaker 1>fault.</v>

3830
03:07:22.230 --> 03:07:25.590
<v Speaker 1>It's just we are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're even through our entire</v>

3831
03:07:25.591 --> 03:07:29.400
<v Speaker 1>developmental process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're shielded through one of the most</v>

3832
03:07:29.401 --> 03:07:31.980
<v Speaker 1>important parts of life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where does your food come from?</v>

3833
03:07:32.190 --> 03:07:34.230
<v Speaker 1>It should be like one of the number one</v>
<v Speaker 1>things you think of.</v>

3834
03:07:34.410 --> 03:07:36.270
<v Speaker 1>Where's your family?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are they safe?</v>

3835
03:07:36.330 --> 03:07:38.600
<v Speaker 1>Where's your food come from?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are question number one and</v>

3836
03:07:38.601 --> 03:07:39.850
<v Speaker 1>question number two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

3837
03:07:40.660 --> 03:07:42.910
<v Speaker 7>Well it's a lot like that with the job</v>
<v Speaker 7>too.</v>

3838
03:07:43.170 --> 03:07:44.920
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and we've had people that have come to</v>

3839
03:07:44.921 --> 03:07:46.900
<v Speaker 7>work for us are like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>okay,</v>

3840
03:07:46.901 --> 03:07:50.260
<v Speaker 7>this is what working for this business</v>
<v Speaker 7>is going to be like,</v>

3841
03:07:50.261 --> 03:07:52.450
<v Speaker 7>and then they come and then they</v>
<v Speaker 7>realize,</v>

3842
03:07:52.570 --> 03:07:55.210
<v Speaker 7>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 7>this is completely different.</v>

3843
03:07:55.240 --> 03:07:59.320
<v Speaker 7>Whereas I've been the same.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I've s I've worked for companies that</v>

3844
03:07:59.321 --> 03:08:03.010
<v Speaker 7>I've really,</v>
<v Speaker 7>really liked and I go there and then I</v>

3845
03:08:03.011 --> 03:08:05.110
<v Speaker 7>realize,</v>
<v Speaker 7>holy cow,</v>

3846
03:08:05.111 --> 03:08:08.380
<v Speaker 7>this is a whole different thing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

3847
03:08:08.440 --> 03:08:10.930
<v Speaker 7>Versus what it really,</v>
<v Speaker 7>really is.</v>

3848
03:08:10.931 --> 03:08:12.460
<v Speaker 7>So it gets tough.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

3849
03:08:13.600 --> 03:08:14.530
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's hard to,</v>

3850
03:08:14.590 --> 03:08:18.280
<v Speaker 7>and that's why he can't really judge</v>
<v Speaker 7>anyone because unless you've been in</v>

3851
03:08:18.281 --> 03:08:22.960
<v Speaker 7>those shoes,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's not really fair to build an</v>

3852
03:08:22.961 --> 03:08:25.690
<v Speaker 7>assessment</v>
<v Speaker 7>easy.</v>

3853
03:08:25.691 --> 03:08:26.524
<v Speaker 7>Now</v>

3854
03:08:26.660 --> 03:08:29.780
<v Speaker 1>smart first one is my first bro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Relax.</v>

3855
03:08:29.830 --> 03:08:31.120
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're absolutely right.</v>

3856
03:08:31.210 --> 03:08:34.880
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's nothing wrong with letting</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone know that doing something wrong</v>

3857
03:08:34.881 --> 03:08:37.380
<v Speaker 1>that's negatively affecting others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

3858
03:08:37.410 --> 03:08:38.110
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

3859
03:08:38.110 --> 03:08:40.270
<v Speaker 1>that's a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's a,</v>

3860
03:08:40.510 --> 03:08:44.440
<v Speaker 1>there's a bigger issue that's like did</v>
<v Speaker 1>when people are like constantly going</v>

3861
03:08:44.441 --> 03:08:46.960
<v Speaker 1>after other people and attacking and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>most vicious way,</v>

3862
03:08:47.320 --> 03:08:51.120
<v Speaker 1>most likely it's because they're trying</v>
<v Speaker 1>to divert attention from,</v>

3863
03:08:51.180 --> 03:08:53.080
<v Speaker 1>from how they are or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or that,</v>

3864
03:08:53.260 --> 03:08:55.480
<v Speaker 1>that it could come back at them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3865
03:08:55.900 --> 03:08:59.590
<v Speaker 1>this is like a weird dance that people</v>
<v Speaker 1>do with liking and disliking other</v>

3866
03:08:59.591 --> 03:09:01.570
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's sign always healthy.</v>

3867
03:09:02.110 --> 03:09:02.990
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I've,</v>

3868
03:09:03.050 --> 03:09:06.160
<v Speaker 1>I've been studying this for the longest</v>
<v Speaker 1>time and I still don't understand it</v>

3869
03:09:06.161 --> 03:09:09.430
<v Speaker 1>totally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have my vague assessments of how it</v>

3870
03:09:09.431 --> 03:09:13.600
<v Speaker 1>all sort of falling into place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know totally how it's</v>

3871
03:09:13.601 --> 03:09:16.000
<v Speaker 1>working,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I know that's the people that are</v>

3872
03:09:16.001 --> 03:09:20.200
<v Speaker 1>the most pleasant to be around are the</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that are both the most friendly,</v>

3873
03:09:20.560 --> 03:09:24.350
<v Speaker 1>the most understanding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most objective in the,</v>

3874
03:09:24.351 --> 03:09:27.910
<v Speaker 1>the most just just loving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just nice people,</v>

3875
03:09:28.000 --> 03:09:28.671
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>

3876
03:09:28.671 --> 03:09:31.460
<v Speaker 1>the friends that we all have that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>know that are like that this is,</v>

3877
03:09:31.461 --> 03:09:32.920
<v Speaker 1>this is the fun people to be around.</v>

3878
03:09:33.100 --> 03:09:34.270
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have a good time.</v>

3879
03:09:34.320 --> 03:09:35.350
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every time I see you,</v>

3880
03:09:35.351 --> 03:09:37.930
<v Speaker 1>I know I'm going to have a good time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We never have a bad time.</v>

3881
03:09:37.990 --> 03:09:39.430
<v Speaker 1>We have fun times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

3882
03:09:39.520 --> 03:09:40.720
<v Speaker 1>we definitely do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3883
03:09:40.730 --> 03:09:44.140
<v Speaker 1>isn't that a nice thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how come that can't be replicated</v>

3884
03:09:44.141 --> 03:09:44.974
<v Speaker 1>everywhere?</v>

3885
03:09:45.090 --> 03:09:48.330
<v Speaker 7>I wish it could.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I totally wish it could.</v>

3886
03:09:48.450 --> 03:09:52.140
<v Speaker 7>I feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I feel like people that haven't</v>

3887
03:09:52.930 --> 03:09:57.930
<v Speaker 7>experienced hardship don't appreciate</v>
<v Speaker 7>the good times as much.</v>

3888
03:09:58.780 --> 03:10:03.700
<v Speaker 7>And I feel like for me anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the fact that I've experienced times</v>

3889
03:10:03.701 --> 03:10:08.701
<v Speaker 7>where I've really struggled and I've had</v>
<v Speaker 7>to either up my game or co or decided to</v>

3890
03:10:09.641 --> 03:10:10.720
<v Speaker 7>quit,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which,</v>

3891
03:10:10.780 --> 03:10:13.330
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's your choices either either you</v>

3892
03:10:13.331 --> 03:10:18.331
<v Speaker 7>step up and you work hard enough to</v>
<v Speaker 7>where you achieve it and then at that</v>

3893
03:10:18.371 --> 03:10:20.650
<v Speaker 7>point you really,</v>
<v Speaker 7>really appreciate it.</v>

3894
03:10:21.220 --> 03:10:24.490
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which is something that I experienced</v>

3895
03:10:24.491 --> 03:10:27.010
<v Speaker 7>when you talk to me about kettle bells.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I thought,</v>

3896
03:10:27.520 --> 03:10:29.110
<v Speaker 7>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 7>well I'm not good at this,</v>

3897
03:10:29.200 --> 03:10:32.380
<v Speaker 7>so either I'm not going to be able to</v>
<v Speaker 7>relate to joe or I'm gonna learn to do</v>

3898
03:10:32.381 --> 03:10:36.010
<v Speaker 7>it right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And I ended up going down to Austin</v>

3899
03:10:36.011 --> 03:10:36.844
<v Speaker 7>because,</v>
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

3900
03:10:36.910 --> 03:10:41.910
<v Speaker 7>I wanted to experience it a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 7>more to where I can appreciate,</v>

3901
03:10:41.951 --> 03:10:44.230
<v Speaker 7>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if Joe's doing a windmill with a</v>

3902
03:10:44.231 --> 03:10:48.610
<v Speaker 7>fricking big foot,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what is this?</v>

3903
03:10:48.820 --> 03:10:52.120
<v Speaker 7>What is this real like?</v>
<v Speaker 7>It looks easy when I watched a youtube</v>

3904
03:10:52.121 --> 03:10:55.540
<v Speaker 7>video,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but then when I grab a fricking chimp</v>

3905
03:10:55.541 --> 03:10:56.980
<v Speaker 7>and do it and,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

3906
03:10:57.160 --> 03:11:00.430
<v Speaker 7>I'm struggling to do it without having</v>
<v Speaker 7>my shoulder hit me in the side of the</v>

3907
03:11:00.431 --> 03:11:01.690
<v Speaker 7>face.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And then I'm thinking,</v>

3908
03:11:01.691 --> 03:11:03.790
<v Speaker 7>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Joe's doing this now with a big foot.</v>

3909
03:11:05.010 --> 03:11:10.010
<v Speaker 7>I think it's like 90 90 I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Somewhere in the night.</v>

3910
03:11:10.800 --> 03:11:14.620
<v Speaker 7>Let's just say it's a 90 pound 90 pound</v>
<v Speaker 7>kettle bell.</v>

3911
03:11:14.920 --> 03:11:15.753
<v Speaker 7>You begin to realize</v>

3912
03:11:15.950 --> 03:11:19.800
<v Speaker 1>started out with the 35 pound one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I struggled with it and then</v>

3913
03:11:20.910 --> 03:11:23.970
<v Speaker 1>it's also I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been doing flexibility exercises</v>

3914
03:11:23.971 --> 03:11:26.840
<v Speaker 1>since I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so when males not as difficult for me is</v>

3915
03:11:26.850 --> 03:11:29.040
<v Speaker 1>a lot of other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was actually pretty easy for me to</v>

3916
03:11:29.041 --> 03:11:32.820
<v Speaker 1>pick up because my body's used to</v>
<v Speaker 1>whipping like everything's kicking.</v>

3917
03:11:33.280 --> 03:11:35.610
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All that kicking and shit kicking is a</v>

3918
03:11:35.611 --> 03:11:38.640
<v Speaker 1>lot of is with your hips,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of is with your waist and your</v>

3919
03:11:38.641 --> 03:11:40.410
<v Speaker 1>hips.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you learn how to like really throw</v>

3920
03:11:40.411 --> 03:11:42.510
<v Speaker 1>power and things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where it all comes from.</v>

3921
03:11:42.511 --> 03:11:44.670
<v Speaker 1>So the windmill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a natural movement of that.</v>

3922
03:11:44.850 --> 03:11:47.190
<v Speaker 1>Like those muscles were already</v>
<v Speaker 1>conditioned and strengthened.</v>

3923
03:11:47.350 --> 03:11:50.350
<v Speaker 7>I feel like I'm adding and totally</v>
<v Speaker 7>inadequate.</v>

3924
03:11:51.040 --> 03:11:53.980
<v Speaker 7>When I looked at you,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I t I do,</v>

3925
03:11:54.610 --> 03:11:58.510
<v Speaker 7>I mean I work out every day,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but</v>

3926
03:12:01.150 --> 03:12:04.000
<v Speaker 7>my physique,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I feel like a lot of people look at my</v>

3927
03:12:04.001 --> 03:12:05.860
<v Speaker 7>physique from a distance and they think,</v>
<v Speaker 7>oh,</v>

3928
03:12:05.861 --> 03:12:10.861
<v Speaker 7>that guy is in really good shape.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But then like I look at you and</v>

3929
03:12:11.590 --> 03:12:16.540
<v Speaker 7>sometimes your abdomen protrudes a</v>
<v Speaker 7>little bit and then I've been rooms or</v>

3930
03:12:16.541 --> 03:12:19.600
<v Speaker 7>joe takes his shirt off and he's like a</v>
<v Speaker 7>Frickin,</v>

3931
03:12:20.110 --> 03:12:23.260
<v Speaker 7>he's jacked.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Don't let them fool you and work out.</v>

3932
03:12:23.440 --> 03:12:24.760
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he works out.</v>

3933
03:12:24.761 --> 03:12:26.080
<v Speaker 7>I'm trying to fool people.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

3934
03:12:26.500 --> 03:12:31.150
<v Speaker 7>He has a little bit of an abdomen that</v>
<v Speaker 7>goes out further than this tax.</v>

3935
03:12:32.090 --> 03:12:35.410
<v Speaker 7>It's only honest with you.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I can't even believe you have that skin</v>

3936
03:12:35.800 --> 03:12:40.800
<v Speaker 7>because I've been in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Your six pack sticks out further than</v>

3937
03:12:41.171 --> 03:12:42.004
<v Speaker 7>your Pec deck</v>

3938
03:12:44.710 --> 03:12:47.350
<v Speaker 1>versus my Pec deck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to show you some of the shit</v>

3939
03:12:47.351 --> 03:12:48.310
<v Speaker 1>that I do out here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3940
03:12:48.400 --> 03:12:49.390
<v Speaker 1>we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll do a little,</v>

3941
03:12:49.391 --> 03:12:50.470
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>working out here.</v>

3942
03:12:50.471 --> 03:12:53.060
<v Speaker 1>But one of the that I've really gotten</v>
<v Speaker 1>into is,</v>

3943
03:12:53.061 --> 03:12:56.360
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's like a circuit of a glute ham</v>

3944
03:12:56.361 --> 03:13:00.350
<v Speaker 1>machine that does your lower back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I do these elevated setups.</v>

3945
03:13:00.560 --> 03:13:02.950
<v Speaker 1>And then I do compression machine or no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3946
03:13:02.960 --> 03:13:04.010
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

3947
03:13:04.060 --> 03:13:05.420
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the third one.</v>

3948
03:13:05.510 --> 03:13:07.640
<v Speaker 1>That's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a reverse hyper.</v>

3949
03:13:07.670 --> 03:13:11.540
<v Speaker 1>That's the third one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I do this whole series of things</v>

3950
03:13:11.541 --> 03:13:15.890
<v Speaker 1>that I'm doing for ABS.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's tremendous for abs and back.</v>

3951
03:13:16.190 --> 03:13:18.640
<v Speaker 1>And I like the sturdiness of your core</v>
<v Speaker 1>and just,</v>

3952
03:13:18.650 --> 03:13:21.440
<v Speaker 1>I feel like if I just do these on a</v>
<v Speaker 1>regular basis,</v>

3953
03:13:21.441 --> 03:13:26.290
<v Speaker 1>it makes it just a giant difference in</v>
<v Speaker 1>how my body moves and how stable I feel.</v>

3954
03:13:26.430 --> 03:13:30.770
<v Speaker 1>I feel like that's why you were good at</v>
<v Speaker 1>word tree is because core so solid.</v>

3955
03:13:30.920 --> 03:13:34.520
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really good foundation and other</v>

3956
03:13:34.521 --> 03:13:35.960
<v Speaker 1>foundations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those club bells,</v>

3957
03:13:35.990 --> 03:13:39.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm really in those club bells.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do all the shield cast with those</v>

3958
03:13:39.441 --> 03:13:41.420
<v Speaker 1>clubs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something about when you do</v>

3959
03:13:41.421 --> 03:13:43.850
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're controlling like a 25 pound</v>

3960
03:13:43.851 --> 03:13:45.860
<v Speaker 1>club,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't seem like a lot of weight.</v>

3961
03:13:46.100 --> 03:13:49.490
<v Speaker 1>But if you could slowly control that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you get a bow in your hand and</v>

3962
03:13:49.491 --> 03:13:51.620
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to level that bow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like you're,</v>

3963
03:13:51.621 --> 03:13:55.820
<v Speaker 1>you have more control of your body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have better understanding of,</v>

3964
03:13:55.880 --> 03:13:56.541
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3965
03:13:56.541 --> 03:13:58.460
<v Speaker 1>all the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the various uh,</v>

3966
03:13:58.461 --> 03:14:01.610
<v Speaker 1>speeds that your muscles can move at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We could just slow it down,</v>

3967
03:14:01.611 --> 03:14:02.750
<v Speaker 1>slow it down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There it is.</v>

3968
03:14:02.751 --> 03:14:03.584
<v Speaker 1>There it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There it is.</v>

3969
03:14:03.770 --> 03:14:07.040
<v Speaker 1>And I feel like the more you strengthen</v>
<v Speaker 1>those muscles,</v>

3970
03:14:07.041 --> 03:14:11.000
<v Speaker 1>particularly stabilizing muscles of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>shoulders with like reverse kettle</v>

3971
03:14:11.001 --> 03:14:11.770
<v Speaker 1>bells,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3972
03:14:11.770 --> 03:14:13.690
<v Speaker 1>kettle upside down kettlebells where the</v>
<v Speaker 1>bottoms,</v>

3973
03:14:13.720 --> 03:14:14.510
<v Speaker 1>I love those.</v>

3974
03:14:14.510 --> 03:14:17.060
<v Speaker 1>Those are great because those are even a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lightweight,</v>

3975
03:14:17.061 --> 03:14:20.990
<v Speaker 1>you're just do it slow and it's well</v>
<v Speaker 1>wiggling and she is big time hammer</v>

3976
03:14:20.991 --> 03:14:23.810
<v Speaker 1>curls too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So good to deltoid,</v>

3977
03:14:23.840 --> 03:14:28.310
<v Speaker 1>full Schulte military shoulder press</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the vertical kettle bell and then,</v>

3978
03:14:28.340 --> 03:14:31.070
<v Speaker 1>but don't sleep on those windmills too</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause it's the same thing.</v>

3979
03:14:31.071 --> 03:14:34.100
<v Speaker 1>It's all shoulder stability actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And flexibility.</v>

3980
03:14:34.520 --> 03:14:37.940
<v Speaker 1>Being able to go to the floor is a big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>big aspect.</v>

3981
03:14:37.941 --> 03:14:39.110
<v Speaker 1>It's huge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's huge.</v>

3982
03:14:39.111 --> 03:14:41.570
<v Speaker 1>And it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like if as long as you don't</v>

3983
03:14:41.571 --> 03:14:43.910
<v Speaker 1>overdo it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's any danger of</v>

3984
03:14:43.911 --> 03:14:46.220
<v Speaker 1>injuring yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think if you do it correctly,</v>

3985
03:14:46.460 --> 03:14:48.950
<v Speaker 1>it's actually the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it strengthens everything.</v>

3986
03:14:49.160 --> 03:14:52.100
<v Speaker 1>Strengthens the whole chain from your</v>
<v Speaker 1>arms,</v>

3987
03:14:52.160 --> 03:14:55.100
<v Speaker 1>your shoulders to your court,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your hips to your legs.</v>

3988
03:14:55.340 --> 03:14:57.800
<v Speaker 1>The whole thing gets strengthened</v>
<v Speaker 1>because everything has to move.</v>

3989
03:14:57.840 --> 03:15:00.770
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to a on at academy,</v>

3990
03:15:01.460 --> 03:15:03.890
<v Speaker 1>I think last summer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

3991
03:15:03.891 --> 03:15:07.040

<v Speaker 1>actually,</v>

3992
03:15:07.041 --> 03:15:08.180

<v Speaker 7>we were down there for the hurricane</v>
<v Speaker 7>harvey.</v>

3994

<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>

3998
03:15:18.351 --> 03:15:19.730
<v Speaker 1>Have you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was very cool.</v>

3999
03:15:20.180 --> 03:15:22.160
<v Speaker 7>Part of that was because of the house</v>
<v Speaker 7>fire.</v>

4000
03:15:22.250 --> 03:15:26.750
<v Speaker 7>I mean obviously when I was someone who</v>
<v Speaker 7>lost everything,</v>

4001
03:15:26.870 --> 03:15:31.010
<v Speaker 7>so I understand where that comes from.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So when the,</v>

4002
03:15:31.450 --> 03:15:36.450
<v Speaker 7>I was actually on a hunt with Andy up in</v>
<v Speaker 7>Alberta when the hurricane happened and</v>

4003
03:15:37.341 --> 03:15:40.070
<v Speaker 7>I was completely disconnected from the</v>
<v Speaker 7>news.</v>

4004
03:15:40.700 --> 03:15:44.030
<v Speaker 7>I got a text from Sharon that just said,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you won't believe what's happening down</v>

4005
03:15:44.031 --> 03:15:48.110
<v Speaker 7>in Houston.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So we ended up coming in and I looked it</v>

4006
03:15:48.111 --> 03:15:49.160
<v Speaker 7>up,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

4007
03:15:49.200 --> 03:15:54.200
<v Speaker 7>with Wifi while we were in town.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And then I showed Annie and I said,</v>

4008
03:15:55.111 --> 03:15:56.880
<v Speaker 7>man,</v>
<v Speaker 7>this is terrible what's happening in,</v>

4009
03:15:56.881 --> 03:15:59.460
<v Speaker 7>down in Texas.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So He's like,</v>

4010
03:16:01.010 --> 03:16:02.840
<v Speaker 7>I wish we could do something.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I said,</v>

4011
03:16:02.841 --> 03:16:03.674
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm Gunna,</v>

4012
03:16:03.710 --> 03:16:08.150
<v Speaker 7>so I just,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I ended up going live and offering to</v>

4013
03:16:08.151 --> 03:16:13.151
<v Speaker 7>auction off my bow during a live feed</v>
<v Speaker 7>and we ended up raising,</v>

4014
03:16:14.810 --> 03:16:18.920
<v Speaker 7>thankfully there were three bidders.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't know if I can announce who they</v>

4015
03:16:18.921 --> 03:16:22.250
<v Speaker 7>were,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but there were three bidders that bid,</v>

4016
03:16:22.400 --> 03:16:25.130
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>about 15 grand,</v>

4017
03:16:25.160 --> 03:16:28.160
<v Speaker 7>I think it was,</v>
<v Speaker 7>think it was 20,</v>

4018
03:16:28.460 --> 03:16:33.460
<v Speaker 7>let me think.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It was about 2100 bucks or 22,000.</v>

4019
03:16:33.620 --> 03:16:38.060
<v Speaker 7>And then we had one person that offered</v>
<v Speaker 7>to match the other two.</v>

4020
03:16:38.090 --> 03:16:41.150
<v Speaker 7>So it ended up getting to be 30,000 that</v>
<v Speaker 7>we raised,</v>

4021
03:16:41.630 --> 03:16:44.150
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>went down to Houston and then,</v>

<v Speaker 7>to a church where we did,</v>

4040
03:17:32.420 --> 03:17:35.900
<v Speaker 7>where we ended up feeding a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 7>people and then delivering all the</v>

4041
03:17:35.901 --> 03:17:39.830

4061
03:18:17.340 --> 03:18:21.540
<v Speaker 7>from different communities.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Texas was a big one for me because I</v>

4062

<v Speaker 7>worked for an archery company for many</v>
<v Speaker 7>years in Texas,</v>

<v Speaker 7>I didn't live in California because if</v>

<v Speaker 7>I like San Diego,</v>

03:18:36.450 --> 03:18:37.890
<v Speaker 7>Colorado,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Montana.</v>

4070
03:18:39.691 --> 03:18:41.640
<v Speaker 7>California,</v>
<v Speaker 7>then I'm my Colorado,</v>

4071
03:18:41.670 --> 03:18:42.630
<v Speaker 7>Montana.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I,</v>

4072
03:18:42.631 --> 03:18:43.710
<v Speaker 7>Texas,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Texas,</v>

4073
03:18:44.130 --> 03:18:47.710
<v Speaker 7>Texas is in the mix baby.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Cause I like Texans,</v>

4074
03:18:47.711 --> 03:18:48.250
<v Speaker 7>man.</v>

4075
03:18:48.250 --> 03:18:49.083
<v Speaker 5>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

4076
03:18:49.180 --> 03:18:52.270
<v Speaker 5>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a stereotype about the worst</v>

4077
03:18:52.271 --> 03:18:55.420
<v Speaker 5>texans,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they're not the best Texans.</v>

4078
03:18:55.600 --> 03:18:58.450
<v Speaker 5>So you never met the best tech since the</v>
<v Speaker 5>best Texans.</v>

4079
03:18:58.470 --> 03:18:58.961

<v Speaker 5>smart and old school.</v>

<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're a cool combination of like hip</v>

<v Speaker 5>and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and progressive and toddler on a tiger.</v>

<v Speaker 5>You want a tiger?</v>

4084
03:19:10.850 --> 03:19:12.220
<v Speaker 5>He could get a dye.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4085
03:19:12.280 --> 03:19:13.510
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you remember,</v>

4086
03:19:13.550 --> 03:19:15.160
<v Speaker 5>did you see my bed?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Remember that bit?</v>

4087
03:19:15.190 --> 03:19:18.400
<v Speaker 5>You saw the little bit that I used to do</v>
<v Speaker 5>about Texas.</v>

4088
03:19:19.780 --> 03:19:21.670
<v Speaker 5>It's legit though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It is legit.</v>

4089
03:19:21.671 --> 03:19:26.671
<v Speaker 5>Texas has more tigers in captivity than</v>
<v Speaker 5>all of the wild of the world.</v>

4090
03:19:27.620 --> 03:19:27.940
<v Speaker 12>Okay.</v>

4091
03:19:27.940 --> 03:19:31.640
<v Speaker 5>More in Texas.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And my joke was like one dude was like</v>

03:19:31.670 --> 03:19:33.270
<v Speaker 5>going through the regulations,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like she hit,</v>

4093
03:19:33.290 --> 03:19:36.110
<v Speaker 5>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you get a tiger ordered up to order it</v>

4094
03:19:36.111 --> 03:19:37.910
<v Speaker 5>up and then his neighbor found out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he goes,</v>

4095
03:19:37.911 --> 03:19:39.000
<v Speaker 5>mom,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't know you get tired.</v>

<v Speaker 5>His neighbors got to guy tires and he's</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

4097

<v Speaker 5>And he opened up tiger world.</v>

4099
03:19:46.520 --> 03:19:50.900
<v Speaker 5>It's fucking ridiculous joke.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's based on a true fact that there's</v>

4100
03:19:50.901 --> 03:19:53.990
<v Speaker 5>more tigers in captivity in Texas than</v>
<v Speaker 5>anywhere in the world.</v>

4101
03:19:54.320 --> 03:19:58.040
<v Speaker 5>But Texas,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the thing is Texas of 2018 is not Texas</v>

4102
03:19:58.041 --> 03:20:02.360
<v Speaker 5>of even 2008 and definitely not Texas of</v>
<v Speaker 5>1,980 [inaudible] it's better and</v>

4103
03:20:02.361 --> 03:20:04.940
<v Speaker 5>smarter and it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a good place to be.</v>

4104
03:20:04.941 --> 03:20:07.010
<v Speaker 5>Men.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Texas is a good place to be.</v>

4105
03:20:07.190 --> 03:20:09.590
<v Speaker 5>It's one of my favorite spots.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It is cool.</v>

4106
03:20:09.650 --> 03:20:10.550
<v Speaker 5>I love it there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

4107
03:20:10.610 --> 03:20:12.440
<v Speaker 5>I liked the people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's sort of,</v>

4108
03:20:12.740 --> 03:20:15.020
<v Speaker 5>it's a weird combination.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like a country.</v>

4109
03:20:15.050 --> 03:20:17.030
<v Speaker 5>It's a kind of think it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it is too.</v>

4110
03:20:17.031 --> 03:20:19.970
<v Speaker 5>It's a completely different</v>

4111
03:20:20.440 --> 03:20:20.780
<v Speaker 12>okay.</v>

4112
03:20:20.780 --> 03:20:22.930
<v Speaker 5>Being it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everything about it's different,</v>

4113
03:20:23.080 --> 03:20:23.950
<v Speaker 5>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>True.</v>

4114
03:20:24.220 --> 03:20:26.050
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I always explained it on stage about</v>

4115
03:20:26.051 --> 03:20:28.210
<v Speaker 5>buckeys.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're taking people that have never</v>

4116
03:20:28.211 --> 03:20:31.000
<v Speaker 5>been a buckeys,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which I went to the first buckeys on</v>

4117
03:20:31.001 --> 03:20:35.260
<v Speaker 5>that heat on when I took supplies down</v>
<v Speaker 5>to Houston for the hurricane.</v>

4118
03:20:35.870 --> 03:20:36.703
<v Speaker 12>Yeah.</v>

4119
03:20:37.000 --> 03:20:39.760
<v Speaker 5>That was my first time at a buckies and</v>
<v Speaker 5>I thought,</v>

4120
03:20:40.270 --> 03:20:43.690
<v Speaker 5>is this a Frickin Costco?</v>
<v Speaker 5>But with fuel,</v>

4121
03:20:44.580 --> 03:20:47.650
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The way I describe it on stage,</v>

4122
03:20:47.651 --> 03:20:52.651
<v Speaker 5>I always say this is like if you were in</v>
<v Speaker 5>the middle of a full on cocaine binge,</v>

4123
03:20:54.390 --> 03:20:56.350
<v Speaker 5>well someone came up to you and said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>

4124
03:20:56.351 --> 03:20:58.540
<v Speaker 5>I want you to make me the ultimate gas</v>
<v Speaker 5>station.</v>

4125
03:21:00.270 --> 03:21:03.520
<v Speaker 5>It's a gas station with hundreds of</v>
<v Speaker 5>pumps.</v>

4126
03:21:03.610 --> 03:21:05.610
<v Speaker 5>Like you can't believe how many pumps</v>
<v Speaker 5>there are.</v>

4127
03:21:05.620 --> 03:21:09.160
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like God damn field of pumps.</v>

4128
03:21:09.460 --> 03:21:12.220
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then you go into this building and</v>

4129
03:21:12.221 --> 03:21:16.330
<v Speaker 5>it is a fucking warehouse filled with</v>
<v Speaker 5>pickled alligator Dick.</v>

4130
03:21:16.331 --> 03:21:21.320
<v Speaker 5>So different kinds of jelly beans and</v>
<v Speaker 5>chuck Norris action genes and camouflage</v>

4131
03:21:21.321 --> 03:21:23.530
<v Speaker 5>and Yeti coolers and smokers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're like,</v>

4132
03:21:23.531 --> 03:21:26.620
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck is this?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it's huge.</v>

4133
03:21:27.070 --> 03:21:32.070
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's like a fucking God damn</v>
<v Speaker 5>football field sized room filled with</v>

4134
03:21:33.041 --> 03:21:37.270
<v Speaker 5>jelly beans,</v>
<v Speaker 5>different kinds of Cammo and real tree.</v>

4135
03:21:37.510 --> 03:21:40.740
<v Speaker 5>There's a buckeys right there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There you can see that's a mild bucky.</v>

4136
03:21:40.741 --> 03:21:44.170
<v Speaker 5>Is that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a plug that's on the edge of the</v>

4137
03:21:44.171 --> 03:21:48.160
<v Speaker 5>fucking Wyoming or some shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Chuck Norris.</v>

4138
03:21:48.170 --> 03:21:51.110
<v Speaker 5>Geez,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's so many pumps.</v>

4139
03:21:51.260 --> 03:21:53.120
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look at that right there.</v>

4140
03:21:53.150 --> 03:21:54.470
<v Speaker 5>How many pumps is that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>One,</v>

4141
03:21:54.471 --> 03:21:59.340
<v Speaker 5>two,</v>
<v Speaker 5>345678910 1112 504010202122 jets into</v>

4142
03:21:59.360 --> 03:22:02.830
<v Speaker 5>fortunate and double.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It might be on double it.</v>

4143
03:22:02.870 --> 03:22:05.270
<v Speaker 5>That might be a hundred right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and there's two on each one,</v>

4144
03:22:05.271 --> 03:22:08.240
<v Speaker 5>so it literally might be 200 for fucking</v>
<v Speaker 5>pumps.</v>

4145
03:22:08.670 --> 03:22:09.770
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's crazy.</v>

4146
03:22:10.130 --> 03:22:12.860
<v Speaker 5>Why doesn't Chuck Norris Make Jeans?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sears too.</v>

4147
03:22:12.861 --> 03:22:14.120
<v Speaker 5>Awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He used to,</v>

4148
03:22:14.570 --> 03:22:16.610
<v Speaker 5>he used to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I used to own a pair of what?</v>

4149
03:22:16.880 --> 03:22:18.340
<v Speaker 5>Let's see these.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm alive.</v>

4150
03:22:18.350 --> 03:22:18.951
<v Speaker 5>Any,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

4151
03:22:18.951 --> 03:22:22.160
<v Speaker 5>not anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I used to put them on the lace up in</v>

4152
03:22:22.161 --> 03:22:23.750
<v Speaker 5>the front.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They did?</v>

4153
03:22:23.800 --> 03:22:25.250
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The laced up in the front and let you do</v>

4154
03:22:25.251 --> 03:22:27.110
<v Speaker 5>sidekicks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There it is.</v>

4155
03:22:27.170 --> 03:22:28.820
<v Speaker 5>Bam.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It has a gusset.</v>

4156
03:22:29.020 --> 03:22:33.140
<v Speaker 5>Looks like Chris Irwin.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They had a gusset in the crotch area.</v>

4157
03:22:33.380 --> 03:22:34.970
<v Speaker 5>I like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The lace up to the front,</v>

4158
03:22:34.971 --> 03:22:39.410
<v Speaker 5>so I might be lying.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That might be a little longer in scene</v>

4159
03:22:39.411 --> 03:22:42.440
<v Speaker 5>there for that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That cowboy boot kick.</v>

4160
03:22:42.441 --> 03:22:45.140
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>back in the day they didn't understand</v>

4161
03:22:45.141 --> 03:22:47.470
<v Speaker 5>about barbell jeans.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They didn't have the time.</v>

4162
03:22:47.720 --> 03:22:52.310
<v Speaker 5>Top of fabric technology.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I do have a pretty good kick distance.</v>

4163
03:22:52.760 --> 03:22:54.770
<v Speaker 5>Have you ever seen mine?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure it's very long.</v>

4164
03:22:55.160 --> 03:22:58.010
<v Speaker 5>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We'll make a video it later at the top</v>

4165
03:22:58.011 --> 03:22:59.240
<v Speaker 5>of a doorway.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ooh,</v>

4166
03:22:59.241 --> 03:23:04.241
<v Speaker 5>look at that dress shirt.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That gentleman right there will always</v>

4167
03:23:04.371 --> 03:23:07.430
<v Speaker 5>have my respect.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Him and Bruce Lee or the reason why I</v>

<v Speaker 5>got into martial arts a hundred percent</v>
<v Speaker 5>watch it.</v>

4169
03:23:09.690 --> 03:23:10.970

<v Speaker 5>When I was a kid,</v>

4170
03:23:11.180 --> 03:23:13.550
<v Speaker 5>one of my most proudest moments of my</v>
<v Speaker 5>life was in Chuck Norris.</v>

4171
03:23:13.551 --> 03:23:16.550
<v Speaker 5>Do who I was.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I ran into him at a kickboxing event in</v>

4172
03:23:16.551 --> 03:23:18.980
<v Speaker 5>New Jersey like way back in the day,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it gave me this big hug.</v>

4173
03:23:18.980 --> 03:23:21.720
<v Speaker 5>It was one of his events that he had.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He had a world combat.</v>

4174
03:23:22.160 --> 03:23:23.300
<v Speaker 5>He gave me a big hug.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

4175
03:23:23.301 --> 03:23:25.280
<v Speaker 5>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Chuck Norris knows who I am.</v>

4176
03:23:25.310 --> 03:23:27.000
<v Speaker 5>Damn right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It couldn't have been happier.</v>

4177
03:23:27.010 --> 03:23:30.310
<v Speaker 5>No wonder you're unbreakable.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Soccer was beeman.</v>

4178
03:23:30.710 --> 03:23:32.300
<v Speaker 5>And then we'll later,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4179
03:23:32.301 --> 03:23:34.370
<v Speaker 5>I took a picture of me and tate tate</v>
<v Speaker 5>again.</v>

4180
03:23:34.690 --> 03:23:36.050
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was a,</v>

4181
03:23:36.110 --> 03:23:41.110
<v Speaker 5>a award show that they did for an old</v>
<v Speaker 5>school karate master and Chuck Norris</v>

4182
03:23:42.321 --> 03:23:44.220
<v Speaker 5>was there and a bunch of other,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4183

<v Speaker 5>and they're telling these awesome</v>
<v Speaker 5>oldschool karate stories.</v>

4185
03:23:48.961 --> 03:23:51.840
<v Speaker 5>They didn't ask me to be there and speak</v>
<v Speaker 5>a little bit and I would wouldn't,</v>

4186
03:23:52.460 --> 03:23:54.470
<v Speaker 5>I mean I do anything for Chuck Norris.</v>

4188
03:23:58.551 --> 03:24:01.730
<v Speaker 5>Chuck Norris changed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He changed my life for real.</v>

4189
03:24:02.210 --> 03:24:04.220
<v Speaker 5>If it wasn't for Chuck Norris movies,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who knows,</v>

4190
03:24:04.221 --> 03:24:05.690
<v Speaker 5>I might not ever got into martial arts.</v>

4191
03:24:05.810 --> 03:24:08.210
<v Speaker 5>I watched him and like lone wolf,</v>
<v Speaker 5>mcquaid and shit.</v>

4192
03:24:08.240 --> 03:24:09.080
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>God damn,</v>

4193
03:24:09.081 --> 03:24:10.400
<v Speaker 5>that might be the coolest guy that's</v>
<v Speaker 5>ever lived.</v>

4194
03:24:10.430 --> 03:24:11.860
<v Speaker 5>Did she laugh?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

4195
03:24:12.110 --> 03:24:15.500
<v Speaker 5>the other night in Vegas when we were</v>
<v Speaker 5>talking about what my wife,</v>

4196
03:24:15.501 --> 03:24:19.400
<v Speaker 5>Sharon's name was supposed to be and</v>
<v Speaker 5>when we're coming up with fake names for</v>

4197
03:24:19.401 --> 03:24:22.760
<v Speaker 5>people know her,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what she was saying at Debra?</v>

4198
03:24:23.090 --> 03:24:24.710
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that was the fake name.</v>

4199
03:24:24.711 --> 03:24:28.100
<v Speaker 5>He goes the fake name.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My wife's name.</v>

4200
03:24:28.370 --> 03:24:31.840
<v Speaker 5>Her Dad actually wanted to name right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bruce Lee.</v>

4201
03:24:31.910 --> 03:24:32.743
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's right.</v>

4202
03:24:33.050 --> 03:24:36.950
<v Speaker 5>That was the crazy story of all time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I forgot about that dude.</v>

4203
03:24:37.500 --> 03:24:41.390
<v Speaker 5>Share and vape pens.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He knew making a rude if your mood,</v>

4204
03:24:41.510 --> 03:24:43.920
<v Speaker 5>if you knew Sharon,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you would laugh at this.</v>

4205
03:24:43.921 --> 03:24:47.670
<v Speaker 5>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>her dad was in a nun chucks and all</v>

4206
03:24:47.671 --> 03:24:52.170
<v Speaker 5>kinds of solar and wind to my wife.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When my wife was born.</v>

4207
03:24:52.560 --> 03:24:53.820
<v Speaker 5>They didn't know what she was going to</v>
<v Speaker 5>be.</v>

4208
03:24:53.821 --> 03:24:58.230
<v Speaker 5>So they had a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he really wanted her name to be Bruce</v>

4209
03:24:58.230 --> 03:24:59.340
<v Speaker 5>Lee.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But if you knew Sharon,</v>

4210
03:24:59.341 --> 03:25:00.510
<v Speaker 5>you'd knew,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4211
03:25:00.511 --> 03:25:05.090
<v Speaker 5>she is far from briefly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do we have any more Alpha brain we need?</v>

4212
03:25:07.740 --> 03:25:10.500
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I made a deal with my wife.</v>

4213
03:25:10.501 --> 03:25:12.960
<v Speaker 5>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not naming the kids.</v>

4214
03:25:13.200 --> 03:25:14.490
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just have veto power.</v>

4215
03:25:14.700 --> 03:25:15.690
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is not fair.</v>

4216
03:25:16.050 --> 03:25:16.731
<v Speaker 5>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just,</v>

4217

<v Speaker 5>it's like that was a good story to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it grew in your body.</v>

4218
03:25:19.800 --> 03:25:20.633
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not,</v>

4219
03:25:21.090 --> 03:25:22.950
<v Speaker 5>I'm not telling you what to name them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

03:25:22.951 --> 03:25:24.390
<v Speaker 5>I will.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I will 100% be there,</v>

4221
03:25:24.391 --> 03:25:26.760
<v Speaker 5>but I'm saying like this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's not pretend this is an even</v>

4222

<v Speaker 5>proposition like you doing that like</v>
<v Speaker 5>99.99999% of the work.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Like you just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as long as you don't call them fucking</v>

4224

<v Speaker 5>apple sauce or something crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is my kid pixie.</v>

4225

4339
03:31:25.970 --> 03:31:29.770
<v Speaker 5>Anything that can unlock its jaw is</v>
<v Speaker 5>pretty gangster dude.</v>

4340
03:31:29.800 --> 03:31:32.210
<v Speaker 5>They fuck with alligators.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They look at an alligator and they go,</v>

4341
03:31:33.440 --> 03:31:35.450
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to just try to eat you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I saw,</v>

4342
03:31:35.690 --> 03:31:39.740
<v Speaker 5>I actually went to a comedy skit at</v>
<v Speaker 5>Riviera memory where you're talking</v>

4343
03:31:39.741 --> 03:31:40.670
<v Speaker 5>about that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look at this thing,</v>

4344
03:31:40.671 --> 03:31:42.430
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't interrupt a little bit,</v>

4345
03:31:42.770 --> 03:31:44.720
<v Speaker 5>but go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>go to the upper left upper left corner.</v>

4346
03:31:44.750 --> 03:31:46.970
<v Speaker 5>You get the best example.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is what happened.</v>

4347
03:31:46.971 --> 03:31:50.600
<v Speaker 5>It died because the alligator blew out</v>
<v Speaker 5>the side of his asshole.</v>

4348
03:31:50.820 --> 03:31:52.230
<v Speaker 5>What?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I try to eat this thing,</v>

4349
03:31:52.520 --> 03:31:54.410
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this literally happened.</v>

4350
03:31:54.800 --> 03:31:59.510
<v Speaker 5>It literally swallowed up this fucking</v>
<v Speaker 5>hole alligator face first,</v>

4351
03:31:59.600 --> 03:32:04.370
<v Speaker 5>and the alligator backed it's way out of</v>
<v Speaker 5>its asshole and they both died in the</v>

4352
03:32:04.371 --> 03:32:07.880
<v Speaker 5>everglades.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But there's this fucking snake is so</v>

4353
03:32:07.881 --> 03:32:10.550
<v Speaker 5>big,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's trying to eat an alligator that's</v>

4354
03:32:10.551 --> 03:32:11.450
<v Speaker 5>bigger than it.</v>

4355
03:32:12.330 --> 03:32:13.560
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It doesn't care.</v>

4356
03:32:13.710 --> 03:32:14.543
<v Speaker 7>These</v>

4357
03:32:15.250 --> 03:32:18.040
<v Speaker 5>crazy fucks have let these things loose</v>

4358
03:32:18.770 --> 03:32:23.030
<v Speaker 7>in the United States of America.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's simple math that,</v>

4359
03:32:23.031 --> 03:32:26.870
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that comic that we saw at Riviera I saw</v>

4360
03:32:27.050 --> 03:32:29.770
<v Speaker 7>in the late nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which I think you were there at that</v>

4361
03:32:29.771 --> 03:32:30.950
<v Speaker 7>time.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We're talking about,</v>

4362
03:32:30.951 --> 03:32:33.330
<v Speaker 7>which is kind of crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>

4363
03:32:33.740 --> 03:32:35.810
<v Speaker 7>but he,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he has going on here.</v>

4364
03:32:35.811 --> 03:32:37.730
<v Speaker 7>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 7>cutting a person out of a snake.</v>

4365
03:32:38.090 --> 03:32:39.080
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>wonderful.</v>

<v Speaker 5>train set on my train is dead.</v>

4369
03:32:48.430 --> 03:32:51.370
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It is a fucking person coming out of</v>

4370
03:32:53.910 --> 03:32:57.700
<v Speaker 5>this is what you need to learn folks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just because you watch nature doesn't</v>

4371
03:32:57.701 --> 03:33:00.490
<v Speaker 5>mean do you know nature.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just like if you watch porn,</v>

4372
03:33:00.491 --> 03:33:02.170
<v Speaker 5>you're not getting laid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's the same thing.</v>

4373
03:33:02.800 --> 03:33:07.800
<v Speaker 5>If you take anything from this podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 5>take that nature is like where you go,</v>

4374
03:33:09.150 --> 03:33:11.330
<v Speaker 5>where you go.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We were talking about BC and you,</v>

4375
03:33:11.331 --> 03:33:15.820
<v Speaker 5>you go bear hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Tell the people how crazy it is up</v>

4376
03:33:15.821 --> 03:33:17.080
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're in the forest filled with</v>

4377
03:33:17.081 --> 03:33:17.914
<v Speaker 5>monsters.</v>

4378
03:33:18.190 --> 03:33:20.680
<v Speaker 7>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well they don't,</v>

4379
03:33:20.681 --> 03:33:22.240
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they don't watch the news.</v>

4380
03:33:22.420 --> 03:33:25.330
<v Speaker 7>It's all about they can't,</v>
<v Speaker 7>can I eat you?</v>

4381
03:33:25.350 --> 03:33:25.860
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

4382
03:33:25.860 --> 03:33:28.990
<v Speaker 7>pretty much like this.</v>
<v Speaker 7>My mouth is this big.</v>

4383
03:33:28.991 --> 03:33:30.760
<v Speaker 7>You're this big.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think you can fit in it.</v>

4384
03:33:31.330 --> 03:33:35.200
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's as simple as it gets that comic</v>

4385
03:33:35.201 --> 03:33:37.440
<v Speaker 7>at revere that time.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Who Was it?</v>

4386
03:33:37.441 --> 03:33:37.980
<v Speaker 7>Do we,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't</v>

4387
03:33:37.980 --> 03:33:40.050
<v Speaker 2>know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wish I knew because it was actually a</v>

4388
03:33:40.051 --> 03:33:42.030
<v Speaker 2>good rules are a really good bid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said.</v>

4389
03:33:42.950 --> 03:33:43.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

4390
03:33:43.810 --> 03:33:47.060
<v Speaker 2>he pretty much talked about uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fact that he,</v>

4391
03:33:47.061 --> 03:33:49.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's so sick of people getting uh,</v>

4392
03:33:49.500 --> 03:33:52.710
<v Speaker 2>complaining about how fast they get</v>
<v Speaker 2>because he said,</v>

4393
03:33:52.740 --> 03:33:55.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>literally it's simple math people.</v>

4394
03:33:55.530 --> 03:34:00.000
<v Speaker 2>Your mouth is this big.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your butt holes this big.</v>

4395
03:34:01.720 --> 03:34:06.360
<v Speaker 2>At some point there's a bottleneck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he just said,</v>

4396
03:34:07.380 --> 03:34:10.320
<v Speaker 2>he said between your mouth and you're in</v>
<v Speaker 2>your asshole.</v>

4397
03:34:11.260 --> 03:34:12.690
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't don my rare,</v>

4398
03:34:12.691 --> 03:34:15.120
<v Speaker 2>well I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was so long ago.</v>

4399
03:34:15.121 --> 03:34:17.670
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was 20 years ago at most.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That sounds like something.</v>

4400
03:34:17.680 --> 03:34:19.470
<v Speaker 2>Dot Marrero.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Say he just said,</v>

4401
03:34:19.471 --> 03:34:20.640
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's simple math.</v>

4402
03:34:20.760 --> 03:34:23.790
<v Speaker 2>That's your mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is this big butt holes this big?</v>

4403
03:34:24.420 --> 03:34:26.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why are you complaining about being fat?</v>

4404
03:34:26.670 --> 03:34:28.410
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the real concept behind that.</v>

4405
03:34:28.440 --> 03:34:30.120
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>16 hour fasting.</v>

4406
03:34:30.690 --> 03:34:33.060
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eddie Bravo in your mouth.</v>

4407
03:34:33.540 --> 03:34:37.050
<v Speaker 2>I was doing 14 for a while,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but Eddie said that it's 16 is really</v>

4408
03:34:37.051 --> 03:34:38.720
<v Speaker 2>where all the benefits happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So all right,</v>

4409
03:34:38.730 --> 03:34:42.090
<v Speaker 2>I'll give it a try.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I tried 16 and a I see it.</v>

4410
03:34:42.270 --> 03:34:44.940
<v Speaker 2>There's definitely something to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's more alertness.</v>

4411
03:34:45.150 --> 03:34:46.830
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I processed food better.</v>

4412
03:34:47.070 --> 03:34:51.750
<v Speaker 2>I think giving your body a smaller</v>
<v Speaker 2>window to process food is really wise.</v>

4413
03:34:51.990 --> 03:34:54.960
<v Speaker 2>I think it also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it aids you because it gives you</v>

4414
03:34:54.961 --> 03:34:57.090
<v Speaker 2>discipline.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just even just a little discipline.</v>

4415
03:34:57.091 --> 03:34:59.220
<v Speaker 2>It's just a baby baby amount of</v>
<v Speaker 2>discipline.</v>

4416
03:34:59.490 --> 03:35:00.870
<v Speaker 2>But it's a no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a lot.</v>

4417
03:35:00.960 --> 03:35:02.580
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not really to me and you,</v>

4418
03:35:02.581 --> 03:35:05.580
<v Speaker 2>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just some people that is seriously,</v>

4419
03:35:05.610 --> 03:35:07.860
<v Speaker 2>but it's all relative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I'm just being honest with them.</v>

4420
03:35:07.861 --> 03:35:09.150
<v Speaker 2>If they just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they need to get past that.</v>

4421
03:35:09.151 --> 03:35:11.280
<v Speaker 2>It's not really a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the benefits of it,</v>

4422
03:35:11.281 --> 03:35:13.560
<v Speaker 2>like how you feel when you finally have</v>
<v Speaker 2>your first meal.</v>

4423
03:35:13.560 --> 03:35:16.170
<v Speaker 2>When you cross over the line,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you feel better and your body works</v>

4424
03:35:16.171 --> 03:35:18.820
<v Speaker 2>better and you have more energy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a fact I have for you.</v>

4425
03:35:18.830 --> 03:35:21.780
<v Speaker 2>Absorb it faster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You and I both are big.</v>

4426
03:35:21.900 --> 03:35:25.290
<v Speaker 2>Fasters I th I mean I fast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

4427
03:35:25.380 --> 03:35:30.380
<v Speaker 2>I normally eat last maybe about seven</v>
<v Speaker 2>o'clock at night and then I normally</v>

4428
03:35:31.531 --> 03:35:36.531
<v Speaker 2>eating in about 10 or so in the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I mean it's,</v>

4429
03:35:37.110 --> 03:35:39.750
<v Speaker 2>it's quite a bit of time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when I eat,</v>

4430
03:35:40.050 --> 03:35:45.050
<v Speaker 2>I legitimately feel like I can feel my</v>
<v Speaker 2>body absorbing everything that I'm</v>

4431
03:35:45.901 --> 03:35:46.940
<v Speaker 2>consuming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

4432
03:35:46.980 --> 03:35:48.630
<v Speaker 2>Like it's processed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything else.</v>

4433
03:35:48.930 --> 03:35:51.720
<v Speaker 2>That's how it's supposed to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's really what fat is all</v>

4434
03:35:51.721 --> 03:35:52.440
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4435
03:35:52.440 --> 03:35:55.020
<v Speaker 2>Fat Is all about you just keep</v>
<v Speaker 2>stockpiling.</v>

4436
03:35:55.170 --> 03:35:56.970
<v Speaker 2>Even though your body hasn't processed</v>
<v Speaker 2>is like,</v>

4437
03:35:56.971 --> 03:35:58.950
<v Speaker 2>I don't even want to put,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll put it over here and your body's</v>

4438
03:35:58.951 --> 03:36:02.230
<v Speaker 2>like stacking up fat over your body</v>
<v Speaker 2>instead of utilizing it for fuel.</v>

4439
03:36:02.230 --> 03:36:04.140
<v Speaker 2>You're just not burning off enough</v>
<v Speaker 2>calories.</v>

4440
03:36:04.210 --> 03:36:05.850
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know that is,</v>

4441
03:36:05.910 --> 03:36:10.380
<v Speaker 2>that's what this whole fasting thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of normalize this for me at least.</v>

4442
03:36:10.620 --> 03:36:12.540
<v Speaker 2>It just gives you this opportunity where</v>
<v Speaker 2>your body says,</v>

4443
03:36:12.541 --> 03:36:14.700
<v Speaker 2>let's just digest everything we got</v>
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>

4444
03:36:14.850 --> 03:36:17.100
<v Speaker 2>Let's just do this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then when there's dude wakes up in</v>

4445
03:36:17.101 --> 03:36:19.530
<v Speaker 2>the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would it be burning fats is the way to</v>

4446
03:36:19.531 --> 03:36:21.810
<v Speaker 2>go and then you feel good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have more energy.</v>

4447
03:36:21.840 --> 03:36:24.480
<v Speaker 2>Body is using ketones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially if you're like someone like</v>

4448
03:36:24.481 --> 03:36:26.250
<v Speaker 2>myself that I'm not eating a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>bread.</v>

4449
03:36:26.520 --> 03:36:28.830
<v Speaker 2>If I eat bread once every two or three</v>
<v Speaker 2>weeks,</v>

4450
03:36:28.831 --> 03:36:32.100
<v Speaker 2>it's a big deal for the pasta.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once every two or three weeks,</v>

4451
03:36:32.101 --> 03:36:34.380
<v Speaker 2>it's a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you feel like dog shit when you do?</v>

4452
03:36:34.560 --> 03:36:35.440
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

4453
03:36:35.441 --> 03:36:39.040
<v Speaker 2>but I don't go crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't go crazy if I don't go crazy.</v>

4454
03:36:39.041 --> 03:36:39.874
<v Speaker 2>I don't feel bad.</v>

4455
03:36:40.300 --> 03:36:43.810
<v Speaker 2>But if I do go crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I eat like a big piece of chocolate</v>

4456
03:36:43.811 --> 03:36:46.690
<v Speaker 2>cake and some ice cream,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel it way more now.</v>

4457
03:36:46.870 --> 03:36:50.380
<v Speaker 2>Way more now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you're more in tune if you're,</v>

4458
03:36:51.160 --> 03:36:54.520
<v Speaker 2>if you're conscious about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you have a better understanding</v>

4459
03:36:54.521 --> 03:36:57.970
<v Speaker 2>of what it actually does to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a problem with people that are in</v>

4460
03:36:57.971 --> 03:37:02.170
<v Speaker 2>the lifestyle of doing every single day</v>
<v Speaker 2>is they don't really realize what it's</v>

4461
03:37:02.171 --> 03:37:03.760
<v Speaker 2>doing to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's that.</v>

4462
03:37:03.761 --> 03:37:06.380
<v Speaker 2>But I think there's also obviously a</v>
<v Speaker 2>tolerance that you develop.</v>

4463
03:37:06.381 --> 03:37:08.590
<v Speaker 2>Just like people develop a tolerance for</v>
<v Speaker 2>alcohol.</v>

4464
03:37:08.800 --> 03:37:12.760
<v Speaker 2>People develop a tolerance for weed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People definitely I think develop a</v>

4465
03:37:12.761 --> 03:37:14.980
<v Speaker 2>tolerance for sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when I don't have it,</v>

4466
03:37:14.981 --> 03:37:17.800
<v Speaker 2>then I feel the full brunt of sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's like I remember,</v>

4467
03:37:18.310 --> 03:37:21.610
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I took my family to get cheeseburgers</v>

4468
03:37:21.611 --> 03:37:26.611
<v Speaker 2>and milkshakes and I had a big ass</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking vanilla milkshake and it was so</v>

4469
03:37:27.491 --> 03:37:28.324
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>

4470
03:37:28.420 --> 03:37:31.780
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was drinking this big ass like 20</v>

4471
03:37:31.781 --> 03:37:36.781
<v Speaker 2>ounce vanilla milkshake and I was eating</v>
<v Speaker 2>this cheeseburger and I hit the wall so</v>

4472
03:37:36.881 --> 03:37:39.930
<v Speaker 2>hard after it was over I had a sit down</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a bike.</v>

4473
03:37:39.940 --> 03:37:42.580
<v Speaker 2>What kind of bitch in mind that I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm getting taken out.</v>

4474
03:37:42.581 --> 03:37:46.150
<v Speaker 2>I get like hamstring buy a cheeseburger</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a milkshake,</v>

4475
03:37:46.300 --> 03:37:51.160
<v Speaker 2>but it was just clearly that I've been</v>
<v Speaker 2>eating clean for so long.</v>

4476
03:37:51.161 --> 03:37:54.460
<v Speaker 2>My body had no idea what to do with that</v>
<v Speaker 2>giant dump of sugar.</v>

4477
03:37:55.180 --> 03:37:59.800
<v Speaker 2>How much sugar do you think is in 20</v>
<v Speaker 2>ounces or 18 and I don't know how much</v>

4478
03:37:59.801 --> 03:38:02.890
<v Speaker 2>it was like one of those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know those Sunday drink things that</v>

4479
03:38:02.891 --> 03:38:05.400
<v Speaker 2>give you a where it's a big ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh God.</v>

<v Speaker 2>the airport in De Moines and I got a</v>
<v Speaker 2>coffee hundred grams.</v>

4482
03:38:15.220 --> 03:38:16.150
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

<v Speaker 2>It was in de Moines airport this</v>

4487
03:38:27.940 --> 03:38:30.130
<v Speaker 2>morning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got a coffee and a guy behind me</v>

4488
03:38:30.131 --> 03:38:31.870
<v Speaker 2>getting a coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>

4489
03:38:31.930 --> 03:38:35.110
<v Speaker 2>I think he was a baggage handler for one</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the airlines.</v>

4490
03:38:36.130 --> 03:38:40.390
<v Speaker 2>I literally came up and I poured nothing</v>
<v Speaker 2>but half and half in my coffee.</v>

4491
03:38:40.960 --> 03:38:43.930
<v Speaker 2>I'm a big,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually feel like I thrive off fat</v>

4492
03:38:43.960 --> 03:38:44.770
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

4493
03:38:44.770 --> 03:38:49.770
<v Speaker 2>because that's what my body wants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He unscrewed the top of the jar of meth?</v>

4494
03:38:51.370 --> 03:38:52.860
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4495
03:38:52.900 --> 03:38:57.550
<v Speaker 2>pretty much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He unscrewed the top off the sugar and</v>

4496
03:38:57.551 --> 03:38:59.920
<v Speaker 2>he started,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was actually like,</v>

4497
03:39:00.040 --> 03:39:00.851
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

4498
03:39:00.851 --> 03:39:02.920
<v Speaker 2>can you do that again so I can video</v>
<v Speaker 2>this?</v>

4499
03:39:03.430 --> 03:39:08.430
<v Speaker 2>He unscrewed the top off the sugar and</v>
<v Speaker 2>started pouring his coffee and he poured</v>

4500
03:39:08.681 --> 03:39:10.420
<v Speaker 2>and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

4501
03:39:10.421 --> 03:39:13.270
<v Speaker 2>is that a lot?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he kept going and kept going</v>

4502
03:39:13.271 --> 03:39:17.050
<v Speaker 2>and kept going and then he tipped the</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing down,</v>

4503
03:39:17.051 --> 03:39:22.051
<v Speaker 2>put the top back on the sugar and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>poured in fricking creamer and I was,</v>

4504
03:39:23.620 --> 03:39:25.480
<v Speaker 2>I was sitting there like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

<v Speaker 2>it's rich.</v>

4506
03:39:27.850 --> 03:39:32.850
<v Speaker 2>It's literally like two or three times</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you're saying and the problem</v>

4507
03:39:34.010 --> 03:39:39.010
<v Speaker 5>is this guy that was half my size needed</v>
<v Speaker 5>that to feel like he could get the day</v>

<v Speaker 5>of the work floor.</v>

4511
03:39:49.160 --> 03:39:50.150
<v Speaker 5>He's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

4513
03:39:53.271 --> 03:39:55.040
<v Speaker 5>sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's do this.</v>

4514
03:39:55.470 --> 03:39:58.160
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

<v Speaker 5>What's that?</v>

4516
03:40:01.310 --> 03:40:02.143
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's okay.</v>

4517
03:40:02.150 --> 03:40:03.830
<v Speaker 5>It's just my pants.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just this.</v>

4518
03:40:03.920 --> 03:40:06.500
<v Speaker 5>Nothing about jeans.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My barbell jeans are wet.</v>

4519
03:40:06.501 --> 03:40:07.760
<v Speaker 5>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>embarrassment.</v>

4520
03:40:08.060 --> 03:40:10.160
<v Speaker 5>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is for your own good ladies and</v>

4521
03:40:10.161 --> 03:40:11.750
<v Speaker 5>gentlemen.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's for comedy.</v>

4522
03:40:12.530 --> 03:40:14.540
<v Speaker 5>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're okay though.</v>

4523
03:40:14.720 --> 03:40:15.560
<v Speaker 5>No computer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

4524
03:40:15.561 --> 03:40:20.100
<v Speaker 5>How many tablespoons of sugars in a</v>
<v Speaker 5>hundred grants.</v>

4525
03:40:20.990 --> 03:40:25.990
<v Speaker 5>When I think of a hundred grams,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm thinking like a baseball of sugar.</v>

4526
03:40:27.080 --> 03:40:28.400
<v Speaker 5>That's what I think.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a lot.</v>

4527
03:40:28.580 --> 03:40:30.860
<v Speaker 5>A major league baseball of sugar.</v>

4528
03:40:31.910 --> 03:40:32.960
<v Speaker 5>Does that make sense?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

4529
03:40:33.380 --> 03:40:34.790
<v Speaker 5>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is that legit?</v>

4530
03:40:35.150 --> 03:40:37.970
<v Speaker 5>Can I see like a physical representation</v>
<v Speaker 5>of 100 grams of sugar?</v>

4531
03:40:38.000 --> 03:40:42.750
<v Speaker 5>One tablespoon equals 12 grams.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's eight.</v>

4532
03:40:44.400 --> 03:40:48.560
<v Speaker 5>Eight and a half.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's so crazy.</v>

4533
03:40:48.561 --> 03:40:51.050
<v Speaker 5>What does that look like?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Quite a baseball.</v>

4534
03:40:51.110 --> 03:40:54.000
<v Speaker 5>It's a baseball because in baseball,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Huh?</v>

4535
03:40:54.230 --> 03:40:56.450
<v Speaker 5>Eight and a half.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Eight and a half is bigger than a golf</v>

4536
03:40:56.451 --> 03:40:56.811
<v Speaker 5>ball.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's,</v>

4537
03:40:56.811 --> 03:40:59.060
<v Speaker 5>I'm just being conservative.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How many golf balls?</v>

4538
03:40:59.180 --> 03:41:01.100
<v Speaker 5>One Kiwi.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Two.</v>

4539
03:41:01.101 --> 03:41:04.220
<v Speaker 5>Three.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I bet it's two golf balls,</v>

4540
03:41:04.730 --> 03:41:06.710
<v Speaker 5>Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whoa,</v>

<v Speaker 5>If you got damn fault nor did that,</v>

4542

<v Speaker 5>you'd be on cloud.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nine seconds.</v>

4543
03:41:15.230 --> 03:41:17.630
<v Speaker 5>Look at that corridor just to get</v>
<v Speaker 5>proportion.</v>

03:41:17.660 --> 03:41:19.760
<v Speaker 5>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Holy Nuggets.</v>

4545
03:41:20.060 --> 03:41:22.940
<v Speaker 5>That's all are you fucking know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>No wonder why it hits a wall.</v>

4546

<v Speaker 5>Cups.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Paris.</v>

4547
03:41:25.970 --> 03:41:28.840
<v Speaker 5>There's a hundred grams right here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's comparing a hundred grams.</v>

4548
03:41:29.430 --> 03:41:30.340
<v Speaker 5>Two Cups.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

4549
03:41:30.370 --> 03:41:32.080
<v Speaker 5>there's two gaps.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's one cup,</v>

4550
03:41:32.380 --> 03:41:35.470
<v Speaker 5>one cup the size of the hundred grams.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's nuts.</v>

4551
03:41:35.590 --> 03:41:37.870
<v Speaker 5>That's so much sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's what's in a milkshake.</v>

4552
03:41:39.230 --> 03:41:43.210
