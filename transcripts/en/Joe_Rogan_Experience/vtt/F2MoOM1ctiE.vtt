<v Speaker 2>but muscle farm is not.</v>

85
00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:19.110
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never used it with protein powders </v>

86
00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:20.740
<v Speaker 2>and stuff like plastic that fills your </v>
<v Speaker 2>stomach up.</v>

87
00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:24.880

88
00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:26.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the pre workout,</v>

89
00:04:26.651 --> 00:04:28.330
<v Speaker 2>post workouts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>proteins,</v>

90
00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:30.180
<v Speaker 2>toilet stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

91
00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.620

<v Speaker 2>your heart rate up to one 80 before your</v>

92
00:04:32.621 --> 00:04:36.640
<v Speaker 2>workout and then afterwards when it </v>
<v Speaker 2>supposedly it tastes good.</v>

93
00:04:36.641 --> 00:04:37.970
<v Speaker 2>It's just full of sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

94
00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:40.180
<v Speaker 2>I've never had a good experience with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>single muscle farm product.</v>

95
00:04:40.181 --> 00:04:41.110
<v Speaker 2>Obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like on it.</v>

96
00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.220
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tim Kennedy just laid down the law.</v>

97
00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:45.940
<v Speaker 1>How rude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

98
00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:48.150
<v Speaker 1>I have nothing bad to say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm about farm.</v>

99
00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:51.600
<v Speaker 1>I have no relationship with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no experience with them,</v>

100
00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.380
<v Speaker 1>but I do have a deep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>long and storied experience with on it.</v>

101
00:04:55.530 --> 00:05:00.530
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our protein powder is 100 percent </v>

102
00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:03.711
<v Speaker 1>natural and also 100 percent sugar free.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only sugar is one gram of sugar,</v>

103
00:05:04.321 --> 00:05:06.510
<v Speaker 1>which is naturally occurring per </v>
<v Speaker 1>serving.</v>

104
00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:08.910
<v Speaker 1>That comes from the hemp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to answer this,</v>

105
00:05:08.911 --> 00:05:13.911
<v Speaker 1>I have to say this every episode,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just because I get asked all the </v>

106
00:05:13.911 --> 00:05:13.911
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you eat him,</v>

107
00:05:13.911 --> 00:05:15.750
<v Speaker 1>you will not test positive for </v>
<v Speaker 1>marijuana.</v>

108
00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:18.840
<v Speaker 1>Hemp does not have any thc in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But again,</v>

109
00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.840
<v Speaker 1>if you read poppy seed Bagels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will test positive for heroin.</v>

110
00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:23.820
<v Speaker 1>It sounds crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's totally true.</v>

111
00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:29.090
<v Speaker 1>Hemp force,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we use the finest available protein </v>

112
00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:30.210
<v Speaker 1>powder that we can buy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which we have to buy from Canada because</v>

113
00:05:30.211 --> 00:05:32.970
<v Speaker 1>the laws are fucking goofy in America </v>
<v Speaker 1>and we're not allowed to grow hemp.</v>

114
00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:36.180
<v Speaker 1>We can buy it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we can't support American farmers,</v>

115
00:05:36.181 --> 00:05:41.181
<v Speaker 1>which drives me fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully laws have been changed and </v>

00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:05.380
<v Speaker 2>see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there is no way to describe,</v>

232
00:11:05.450 --> 00:11:10.450
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like moments like that where you're </v>

233
00:11:10.450 --> 00:11:12.631
<v Speaker 2>surrounded by these heroes that these </v>
<v Speaker 2>selfless freaking superstars of humanity</v>

234
00:11:13.210 --> 00:11:15.180
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

235
00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:17.680
<v Speaker 2>they bleed in every sense of the word </v>
<v Speaker 2>for their country.</v>

236
00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:20.680
<v Speaker 2>And then the national anthem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kamala and,</v>

237
00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:23.490
<v Speaker 2>or the flag goes up and you see them all</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there,</v>

238
00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:28.520
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's this energy there that just </v>

239
00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:28.520
<v Speaker 2>can't be described.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It can only be experienced.</v>

240
00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:28.520
<v Speaker 2>It's surreal,</v>

241
00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:28.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the,</v>

242
00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:30.530
<v Speaker 1>that's the really intense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

243
00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:35.660
<v Speaker 1>aspect of it is that there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of resistance and blow </v>

244
00:11:36.991 --> 00:11:41.991
<v Speaker 1>back towards war and towards the </v>
<v Speaker 1>military industrial complex and towards,</v>

245
00:11:42.210 --> 00:11:43.520
<v Speaker 1>both of which are horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

246
00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:48.060
<v Speaker 1>But what the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's important is the people ever.</v>

247
00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:50.850
<v Speaker 1>Everybody wants everything to be black </v>
<v Speaker 1>and white and there's no black and white</v>

248
00:11:50.851 --> 00:11:55.851
<v Speaker 1>in this world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's this gigantic of shades and </v>

249
00:11:55.851 --> 00:11:56.770
<v Speaker 1>there's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's positive and there's negative,</v>

250
00:11:56.771 --> 00:11:59.620
<v Speaker 1>there's good and there's bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there are real heroes in the world.</v>

251
00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:04.690
<v Speaker 1>I'm Pat Tillman is a perfect example of </v>
<v Speaker 1>a guy who was a real hero in my opinion.</v>

252
00:12:04.691 --> 00:12:07.180
<v Speaker 1>A guy who saw what was going on and </v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

253
00:12:07.181 --> 00:12:08.950
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck this NFL career.</v>

254
00:12:08.951 --> 00:12:13.951
<v Speaker 1>I don't need millions of dollars when I </v>
<v Speaker 1>needed to do is do what's right and I </v>

255
00:12:13.951 --> 00:12:14.770
<v Speaker 1>need to fight for my country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes over there and then when he gets</v>

256
00:12:14.771 --> 00:12:19.771
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he experienced chaos and nonsense and </v>

257
00:12:19.771 --> 00:12:23.721
<v Speaker 1>he's super vocal about it and completely</v>
<v Speaker 1>as is his brother and that's to me a </v>

258
00:12:24.581 --> 00:12:27.160
<v Speaker 1>perfect example of that.</v>

259
00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:30.610
<v Speaker 1>There is no black and white.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of.</v>

260
00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:36.300
<v Speaker 1>There's real heroes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's people that have heroic content </v>

261
00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:39.360
<v Speaker 1>and there's people that have heroic </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideals and they really do love and </v>

262
00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:44.131
<v Speaker 1>respect the idea of freedom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they get thrust into a situation </v>

263
00:12:44.131 --> 00:12:47.620
<v Speaker 1>where everything is completely out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>control and chaotic and a garlic.</v>

264
00:12:47.621 --> 00:12:50.860
<v Speaker 1>Pat Tillman was very vocal about it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>well spoken,</v>

265
00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:53.350
<v Speaker 1>very well spoken as is his brother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

266
00:12:53.730 --> 00:12:57.310
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a very intense thing and when,</v>

267
00:12:57.311 --> 00:13:00.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people were anti war and you know,</v>

268
00:13:00.521 --> 00:13:00.920
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

269
00:13:00.921 --> 00:13:04.730
<v Speaker 1>it's Kinda,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fashionable to be anti war,</v>

270
00:13:04.731 --> 00:13:09.731
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a thing that a lot of people put </v>

271
00:13:09.731 --> 00:13:09.731
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like an outfit.</v>

272
00:13:09.731 --> 00:13:13.440
<v Speaker 1>They just sort of jump into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sentiment that we shouldn't have a </v>

273
00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:16.291
<v Speaker 1>military and we shouldn't have wore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The real problem is human beings are </v>

274
00:13:16.291 --> 00:13:17.920
<v Speaker 1>still animals and a lot of research,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of respects,</v>

275
00:13:17.950 --> 00:13:22.950
<v Speaker 1>a lot of senses and probably nobody </v>
<v Speaker 1>knows that more than a guy like you </v>

276
00:13:22.950 --> 00:13:22.950
<v Speaker 1>who's been there.</v>

277
00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:25.780
<v Speaker 2>War is horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hate war.</v>

278
00:13:25.810 --> 00:13:30.810
<v Speaker 2>I am anti war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been anti war my whole entire life </v>

279
00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:30.810
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

280
00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:33.010
<v Speaker 2>uncles that fought in world war two or </v>
<v Speaker 2>in Vietnam,</v>

281
00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:38.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>grandparents that fought in world war </v>

282
00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:38.060
<v Speaker 2>two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

283
00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:41.430
<v Speaker 2>but with that position of being anti </v>
<v Speaker 2>war,</v>

284
00:13:41.951 --> 00:13:46.951
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you should be able to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>anti war unless you understand at a </v>

285
00:13:46.951 --> 00:13:49.060
<v Speaker 2>fundamental level how awful and horrible</v>
<v Speaker 2>war is not.</v>

286
00:13:49.090 --> 00:13:50.500
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't mean they have to go and </v>
<v Speaker 2>serve.</v>

287
00:13:50.501 --> 00:13:51.300
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

288
00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:53.260
<v Speaker 2>it's necessary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

289
00:13:53.261 --> 00:13:53.950
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

290
00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:59.280
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't wish what I've seen in my </v>

291
00:13:59.280 --> 00:13:59.280
<v Speaker 2>life on my worst enemy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

292
00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:02.650
<v Speaker 2>there's no way I'd want the people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hate to have to see know what a little</v>

293
00:14:02.651 --> 00:14:05.290
<v Speaker 2>girl looks like when she's been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>had acid thrown on her because she tried</v>

294
00:14:05.291 --> 00:14:06.550
<v Speaker 2>to go to school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want that,</v>

295
00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:08.230
<v Speaker 2>want that on my worst enemy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

296
00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:10.630
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's people that do those things,</v>

297
00:14:10.990 --> 00:14:15.990
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's people that go and kidnap 300 </v>

298
00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:17.800
<v Speaker 2>girls in school this week because they </v>
<v Speaker 2>were going to school,</v>

299
00:14:18.130 --> 00:14:19.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those people don't.</v>

300
00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:23.440
<v Speaker 2>They have to answer to somebody and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>only people they would answer to or guys</v>

301
00:14:23.441 --> 00:14:27.040
<v Speaker 2>like me or guys that are better than me </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are still doing it.</v>

302
00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:29.650
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's a necessary evil.</v>

303
00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:31.180
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you fight fire with fire,</v>

304
00:14:31.181 --> 00:14:34.870
<v Speaker 2>you fight evil with just a more violent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>better version of evil,</v>

305
00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:35.380
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

306
00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:40.720
<v Speaker 1>that's a crazy way to look at the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in a lot of respects,</v>

307
00:14:40.750 --> 00:14:45.750
<v Speaker 1>there's no other options.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in some situations there are no </v>

308
00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:49.261
<v Speaker 1>other options unless you let evil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>overwhelming area or evil overwhelm a </v>

309
00:14:49.261 --> 00:14:50.950
<v Speaker 1>group of innocent people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's almost no.</v>

310
00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:57.100
<v Speaker 1>And to denied the existence of evil is </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely fucking ridiculous.</v>

311
00:14:57.710 --> 00:14:59.990
<v Speaker 1>Especially if you just look at human </v>
<v Speaker 1>history,</v>

312
00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:02.690
<v Speaker 1>look at human history from recorded </v>
<v Speaker 1>times,</v>

313
00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:05.240
<v Speaker 1>from the beginning when people started </v>
<v Speaker 1>writing things down.</v>

314
00:15:05.241 --> 00:15:07.160
<v Speaker 1>People always did awful shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they could get away</v>

315
00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:09.560
<v Speaker 2>to get away from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get away with it.</v>

316
00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:11.990
<v Speaker 2>For evil to prevail all it takes us for </v>
<v Speaker 2>good men to do nothing.</v>

317
00:15:11.991 --> 00:15:13.610
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So great quote.</v>

318
00:15:14.110 --> 00:15:19.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just have to do something even if it's </v>

319
00:15:19.110 --> 00:15:19.110
<v Speaker 2>horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How long were you over there for?</v>

320
00:15:19.370 --> 00:15:21.710
<v Speaker 2>I was eight years active duty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

321
00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:26.740
<v Speaker 2>special forces.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now it's been three years as a </v>

322
00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:29.870
<v Speaker 2>national guardsman in special forces.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And how old are you now?</v>

323
00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:31.430
<v Speaker 2>Thirty four.</v>

324
00:15:31.650 --> 00:15:33.390
<v Speaker 1>So wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you were really young,</v>

325
00:15:33.391 --> 00:15:36.420
<v Speaker 1>so you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're essentially like college age?</v>

326
00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:41.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as soon as I was in Grad school when I </v>

327
00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:41.520
<v Speaker 2>enlisted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And how old were you then?</v>

328
00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:43.240
<v Speaker 2>I was 22.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

329
00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:49.240
<v Speaker 1>So you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you saw what was going on and you just </v>

330
00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:49.700
<v Speaker 1>decided that this was calling you.</v>

331
00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:54.310
<v Speaker 2>It was a balance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like the perfect storm for me,</v>

332
00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:56.500
<v Speaker 2>for me to go in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

333
00:15:57.220 --> 00:15:59.110
<v Speaker 2>I was kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this was before it.</v>

334
00:15:59.111 --> 00:16:00.280
<v Speaker 2>We'll call,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll call it pro.</v>

335
00:16:00.281 --> 00:16:04.750
<v Speaker 2>I was a pro MMA fighter and I had five </v>
<v Speaker 2>fights as foreign one,</v>

336
00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:06.760
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just won this ECC,</v>

337
00:16:06.761 --> 00:16:08.680
<v Speaker 2>50 big eight men tournament,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

338
00:16:08.681 --> 00:16:09.970
<v Speaker 2>Jason Miller,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dennis Kang,</v>

339
00:16:09.971 --> 00:16:10.840
<v Speaker 2>myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're all in it.</v>

340
00:16:10.841 --> 00:16:13.480
<v Speaker 2>And I was the one that won it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like I had good promise.</v>

341
00:16:13.530 --> 00:16:14.920
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was a Douche bag.</v>

342
00:16:14.950 --> 00:16:19.950
<v Speaker 2>I was a little idiot in San Luis Obispo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know with the entire,</v>

343
00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:24.550
<v Speaker 2>the Mecca of fighting at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like worrying about what genes I was</v>

344
00:16:24.551 --> 00:16:26.290
<v Speaker 2>going to wear to the next party,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

345
00:16:26.291 --> 00:16:27.000
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

346
00:16:27.010 --> 00:16:29.620
<v Speaker 2>I want to with my next winnings from </v>
<v Speaker 2>this fight,</v>

347
00:16:29.621 --> 00:16:31.750
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to go buy these something </v>
<v Speaker 2>stupid.</v>

348
00:16:31.780 --> 00:16:33.580
<v Speaker 2>Did you have genes that are already </v>
<v Speaker 2>ripped?</v>

349
00:16:33.730 --> 00:16:34.570
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

350
00:16:37.450 --> 00:16:40.120
<v Speaker 2>Can I pay way too much for really crappy</v>
<v Speaker 2>genes?</v>

351
00:16:40.121 --> 00:16:41.050
<v Speaker 2>That looks cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyways,</v>

352
00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:44.080
<v Speaker 2>so make it a lot of poor decisions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

353
00:16:44.081 --> 00:16:49.081
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nine slash 11 happened and it was just </v>

354
00:16:49.081 --> 00:16:50.230
<v Speaker 2>one of those instances that's a godsend.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Divine intervention may be where you get</v>

355
00:16:50.231 --> 00:16:55.231
<v Speaker 2>this extra central perspective of how </v>
<v Speaker 2>much of an idiot you are.</v>

356
00:16:55.690 --> 00:16:56.770
<v Speaker 2>And that's what I had.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

357
00:16:56.771 --> 00:17:01.771
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am really one of the worst people on </v>

358
00:17:01.771 --> 00:17:01.771
<v Speaker 2>the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

359
00:17:01.771 --> 00:17:01.771
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not being a productive,</v>

360
00:17:01.771 --> 00:17:02.980
<v Speaker 2>contributing member to society in any </v>
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>

361
00:17:03.010 --> 00:17:08.010
<v Speaker 2>just being a succubus of life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I walked down after nine slash 11</v>

362
00:17:08.561 --> 00:17:11.890
<v Speaker 2>to the recruiter's office and the pro,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wish I could just knock on the door,</v>

363
00:17:11.891 --> 00:17:16.891
<v Speaker 2>but that wasn't the issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The issue was that there was like a </v>

364
00:17:16.891 --> 00:17:17.230
<v Speaker 2>thousand other dudes in line ahead of me</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I wanted to do the same thing.</v>

365
00:17:17.610 --> 00:17:22.610
<v Speaker 2>And just to give you a testament about </v>
<v Speaker 2>how amazing the backbone of our country </v>

366
00:17:22.610 --> 00:17:22.610
<v Speaker 2>still is.</v>

367
00:17:22.610 --> 00:17:25.780
<v Speaker 1>What was that feeling like when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>showed up and you see a thousand other</v>

368
00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:30.350
<v Speaker 2>that are wrapping around the supermarket</v>
<v Speaker 2>have the same mentality?</v>

369
00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:32.060
<v Speaker 2>How humbling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

370
00:17:32.061 --> 00:17:33.050
<v Speaker 2>we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

371
00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:36.200
<v Speaker 2>I'm still still a little fucked hard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

372
00:17:36.250 --> 00:17:37.020
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

373
00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:39.050
<v Speaker 2>thinking us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to go enlist,</v>

374
00:17:39.051 --> 00:17:39.770
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I get down there,</v>

375
00:17:39.771 --> 00:17:41.510
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

376
00:17:41.511 --> 00:17:42.950
<v Speaker 2>I should've been here like five hours </v>
<v Speaker 2>ago,</v>

377
00:17:43.710 --> 00:17:45.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

378
00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:47.880
<v Speaker 2>instance after instance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

379
00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:50.700
<v Speaker 2>it cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was amazing.</v>

380
00:17:50.701 --> 00:17:54.420
<v Speaker 2>It was humbling is what it was to see </v>
<v Speaker 2>all these dudes ahead of you that um,</v>

381
00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:56.010
<v Speaker 2>their instant reaction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

382
00:17:56.011 --> 00:18:00.450
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't a little retrospective </v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective of like what you're doing in</v>

383
00:18:00.451 --> 00:18:01.320
<v Speaker 2>your life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>

384
00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:06.860
<v Speaker 2>fuck this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those dudes just flew planes into our </v>

385
00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:06.860
<v Speaker 2>buildings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going,</v>

386
00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:06.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

387
00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:07.980
<v Speaker 2>that's what they were where I was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little bit late.</v>

388
00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:10.500
<v Speaker 2>So I think just the response is </v>
<v Speaker 2>humbling.</v>

389
00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:13.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very tricky because the people that</v>

390
00:18:13.081 --> 00:18:14.760
<v Speaker 2>flew the planes are already dead,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

391
00:18:14.930 --> 00:18:16.720
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>

392
00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:21.760
<v Speaker 2>the idea that there is a faction of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world that's planning things along these</v>

393
00:18:21.781 --> 00:18:25.940
<v Speaker 2>lines and it's willing to go to such </v>
<v Speaker 2>extreme lengths when you,</v>

394
00:18:25.941 --> 00:18:30.941
<v Speaker 2>when you see shit like that happen in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the world and you see it from a </v>

395
00:18:31.201 --> 00:18:36.201
<v Speaker 2>perspective of an outsider versus seeing</v>
<v Speaker 2>it from a perspective of someone who's </v>

396
00:18:36.201 --> 00:18:37.640
<v Speaker 2>actually there and in the military,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

397
00:18:37.710 --> 00:18:39.900
<v Speaker 2>what is the difference?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is the feeling like?</v>

398
00:18:40.210 --> 00:18:43.200
<v Speaker 2>Like it's once you became active duty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once you're there,</v>

399
00:18:43.410 --> 00:18:45.660
<v Speaker 2>what is the difference in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective?</v>

400
00:18:47.190 --> 00:18:49.000
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

401
00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:54.020
<v Speaker 2>nine slash 11.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think everybody remembers exactly </v>

402
00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:54.020
<v Speaker 2>where they were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

403
00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:57.280
<v Speaker 2>I'm no different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember the exact place that I was </v>

404
00:18:57.280 --> 00:18:57.450
<v Speaker 2>and exactly what I was doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

405
00:18:57.720 --> 00:19:00.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I remember my response being anger,</v>

406
00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:03.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I wanted to lash out and revenge.</v>

407
00:19:05.370 --> 00:19:07.470
<v Speaker 2>I don't have that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not in me anymore.</v>

408
00:19:07.570 --> 00:19:09.540
<v Speaker 2>Like I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never respond that way anymore.</v>

409
00:19:09.541 --> 00:19:14.541
<v Speaker 2>When I see things happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I almost had like this cold calculated </v>

410
00:19:14.541 --> 00:19:14.541
<v Speaker 2>response,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

411
00:19:14.541 --> 00:19:15.690
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

412
00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:20.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hear about something happening and I </v>

413
00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:23.930
<v Speaker 2>don't want to go over with a baseball </v>
<v Speaker 2>bat and smashed a bunch of dudes heads </v>

414
00:19:23.930 --> 00:19:23.930
<v Speaker 2>in like I did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

415
00:19:23.930 --> 00:19:28.880
<v Speaker 2>12 years ago now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like when bin Laden was killed,</v>

416
00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:34.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I spent some prime years of my life and </v>

417
00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:34.170
<v Speaker 2>mountains of Afghanistan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pakistan looking for that,</v>

418
00:19:34.290 --> 00:19:35.910
<v Speaker 2>that idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

419
00:19:35.940 --> 00:19:37.980
<v Speaker 2>and then navy seals go in and get them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

420
00:19:37.981 --> 00:19:39.270
<v Speaker 2>and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dang,</v>

421
00:19:39.271 --> 00:19:40.790
<v Speaker 2>I missed it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

422
00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:42.120
<v Speaker 2>I was kind of sad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't mad.</v>

423
00:19:42.121 --> 00:19:43.440
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't angry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want to be there.</v>

424
00:19:43.441 --> 00:19:44.850
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to shoot it myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I was like,</v>

425
00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:47.310
<v Speaker 2>Oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you didn't want to shoot them yourself.</v>

426
00:19:47.670 --> 00:19:50.100
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would love to have shot him myself,</v>

427
00:19:50.130 --> 00:19:54.060
<v Speaker 2>but I wasn't mad that I didn't get to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was my response,</v>

428
00:19:54.210 --> 00:19:55.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>11,</v>

429
00:19:55.081 --> 00:19:58.920
<v Speaker 2>12 years ago just calculated like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

430
00:19:59.010 --> 00:20:03.330
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that whole event was one of the biggest,</v>

431
00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:06.090
<v Speaker 2>like what do you think really happened?</v>

432
00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:11.120
<v Speaker 2>Conspiracies online when they didn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>show the body and they threw it in the </v>

433
00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:15.141
<v Speaker 2>ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the whole idea that he was going to </v>

434
00:20:15.141 --> 00:20:15.330
<v Speaker 2>be a martyr like that was so perplexing </v>
<v Speaker 2>to me.</v>

435
00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:17.790
<v Speaker 2>The whole thing was so completely </v>
<v Speaker 2>perplexing to me.</v>

436
00:20:17.791 --> 00:20:20.430
<v Speaker 2>Like why wouldn't you just show his body</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

437
00:20:20.431 --> 00:20:21.960
<v Speaker 2>can we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can we take a look?</v>

438
00:20:22.270 --> 00:20:25.140
<v Speaker 2>The whole world wants to see the bad guy</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you,</v>

439
00:20:25.170 --> 00:20:27.810
<v Speaker 2>when you just historically through the </v>
<v Speaker 2>course of this war,</v>

440
00:20:27.811 --> 00:20:29.970
<v Speaker 2>when we've done it on numerous </v>
<v Speaker 2>instances,</v>

441
00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:34.680
<v Speaker 2>whether it's Saddam hanging or Zarqawi </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's blown up body.</v>

442
00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:37.470
<v Speaker 2>Like some.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was involved with someone I wasn't.</v>

443
00:20:38.130 --> 00:20:42.750
<v Speaker 2>It's been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's been very clear the response by the</v>

444
00:20:42.751 --> 00:20:45.450
<v Speaker 2>fanatic side when they see the body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

445
00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:47.950
<v Speaker 2>maybe that person becomes a martyr,</v>

446
00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:53.010
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then then he's like idolized for </v>

447
00:20:53.010 --> 00:20:54.220
<v Speaker 3>years or maybe it just incites and </v>
<v Speaker 3>immediate riot.</v>

448
00:20:54.820 --> 00:20:56.170
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it sucks.</v>

449
00:20:56.171 --> 00:20:59.580
<v Speaker 3>We want to have that justice feeling of </v>
<v Speaker 3>like the conclusion that,</v>

450
00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:01.180
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the finale of like,</v>

451
00:21:01.181 --> 00:21:03.130
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's been lot and he's dead.</v>

452
00:21:03.131 --> 00:21:05.170
<v Speaker 3>Look at that point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The beard of his.</v>

453
00:21:05.171 --> 00:21:06.860
<v Speaker 3>That's definitely him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alright,</v>

454
00:21:06.910 --> 00:21:08.050
<v Speaker 3>we can sleep at night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

455
00:21:08.051 --> 00:21:10.120
<v Speaker 3>the Boogeyman bin Ladin it's not under </v>
<v Speaker 3>the bed.</v>

456
00:21:10.690 --> 00:21:15.690
<v Speaker 3>But had they done that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the repercussions would have been so </v>

457
00:21:15.690 --> 00:21:16.600
<v Speaker 3>much more severe with riots and </v>
<v Speaker 3>possibly,</v>

458
00:21:16.601 --> 00:21:18.280
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a longstanding martyrdom.</v>

459
00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:20.290
<v Speaker 3>So I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

460
00:21:20.291 --> 00:21:21.850
<v Speaker 3>I know what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shades of gray,</v>

461
00:21:21.851 --> 00:21:23.170
<v Speaker 3>like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it sucks.</v>

462
00:21:23.770 --> 00:21:25.180
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm selfish.</v>

463
00:21:25.290 --> 00:21:27.070
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to see the dead body.</v>

464
00:21:27.970 --> 00:21:31.660
<v Speaker 3>And plus I don't totally believe </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything they say.</v>

465
00:21:31.870 --> 00:21:32.830
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you,</v>

466
00:21:32.831 --> 00:21:35.350
<v Speaker 3>when you talked to high ranking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>military guys would say,</v>

467
00:21:35.351 --> 00:21:36.610
<v Speaker 3>that guy's been dead forever.</v>

468
00:21:36.610 --> 00:21:41.610
<v Speaker 3>He's been dead a long time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was another part of the conspiracy </v>

469
00:21:41.610 --> 00:21:43.810
<v Speaker 3>guys that were in the know is saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that guy was dead already.</v>

470
00:21:44.770 --> 00:21:49.770
<v Speaker 3>There's no way that he's still alive </v>
<v Speaker 3>because we've probably killed him like </v>

471
00:21:49.770 --> 00:21:52.330
<v Speaker 3>10 times now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So whether this was the final version of</v>

472
00:21:52.331 --> 00:21:54.580
<v Speaker 3>him or the 10th,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's irrelevant.</v>

473
00:21:54.820 --> 00:21:56.520
<v Speaker 3>All versions have been loud and her </v>
<v Speaker 3>dead.</v>

474
00:21:56.550 --> 00:21:57.550
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's not Jason.</v>

475
00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:00.160
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to pop up out of the ocean the</v>
<v Speaker 3>11th time.</v>

476
00:22:00.790 --> 00:22:03.040
<v Speaker 3>Swim to shore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A to bitch.</v>

477
00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:04.990
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's start from scratch.</v>

478
00:22:05.470 --> 00:22:10.470
<v Speaker 3>The idea is a terrifying to us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like fanatical religious fundamentalists</v>

479
00:22:11.050 --> 00:22:14.080
<v Speaker 3>that are willing to die is terrifying </v>
<v Speaker 3>for a good reason.</v>

480
00:22:14.290 --> 00:22:18.190
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the worst aspects of human </v>
<v Speaker 3>beings is that we can talk people and to</v>

481
00:22:18.191 --> 00:22:23.191
<v Speaker 3>believe in some completely ridiculous </v>
<v Speaker 3>shit and talk them into believing it so </v>

482
00:22:23.191 --> 00:22:25.030
<v Speaker 3>much so that they're willing to kill </v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves and we all.</v>

483
00:22:25.110 --> 00:22:29.650
<v Speaker 3>The other problem with human beings is </v>
<v Speaker 3>that once a guy gets that far,</v>

484
00:22:29.740 --> 00:22:32.170
<v Speaker 3>once it got once a human man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>woman,</v>

485
00:22:32.171 --> 00:22:34.610
<v Speaker 3>whatever it was that far gone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do you bring it back?</v>

486
00:22:34.611 --> 00:22:39.611
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a friend who has adopted a child </v>

487
00:22:39.611 --> 00:22:41.020
<v Speaker 3>and I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The kid was a,</v>

488
00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:46.080
<v Speaker 3>I think she was probably three when they</v>
<v Speaker 3>adopted her and she's six now and the </v>

489
00:22:46.661 --> 00:22:48.280
<v Speaker 3>poor kid's a mess,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

490
00:22:48.281 --> 00:22:53.281
<v Speaker 3>And they really worried.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't know what she experienced a </v>

491
00:22:53.281 --> 00:22:55.741
<v Speaker 3>lot of abuse before they ever got to her</v>
<v Speaker 3>and now she's six years old and they're </v>

492
00:22:55.741 --> 00:22:58.950
<v Speaker 3>just trying to wrangle her and educator </v>
<v Speaker 3>and give her love and give her.</v>

493
00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:00.640
<v Speaker 3>But they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>God damn,</v>

494
00:23:00.641 --> 00:23:02.920
<v Speaker 3>if we just got there sooner,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the idea.</v>

495
00:23:03.050 --> 00:23:06.190
<v Speaker 3>You're talking about three years old,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

496
00:23:06.191 --> 00:23:09.930
<v Speaker 3>get some guy who's fucking 30 and he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>all.</v>

497
00:23:09.931 --> 00:23:11.740
<v Speaker 3>I walk by all day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

498
00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:16.720
<v Speaker 3>bowing and ready to be a martyr,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's fucking.</v>

499
00:23:17.050 --> 00:23:21.130
<v Speaker 3>It's impossible to change the course of </v>
<v Speaker 3>that sort of ideology.</v>

500
00:23:21.330 --> 00:23:23.860
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have no idea how,</v>

501
00:23:23.890 --> 00:23:26.590
<v Speaker 3>if you're smart,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ecstasy,</v>

502
00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:29.740
<v Speaker 3>mushrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 3>isolation,</v>

503
00:23:29.770 --> 00:23:34.120
<v Speaker 3>reprogramming some of the solution was </v>
<v Speaker 3>way easier.</v>

504
00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:38.890
<v Speaker 3>I'm definitely more repercussions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

505
00:23:38.891 --> 00:23:39.720
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>

506
00:23:39.730 --> 00:23:41.590
<v Speaker 3>We're all going to live.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're all going to die.</v>

507
00:23:41.740 --> 00:23:44.680
<v Speaker 3>And you gotta pull weeds out of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>garden.</v>

508
00:23:44.681 --> 00:23:46.430
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's just the reality</v>

509
00:23:46.430 --> 00:23:51.430
<v Speaker 1>of the situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea of equating a human being like </v>

510
00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:52.460
<v Speaker 1>a weed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty gross,</v>

511
00:23:52.461 --> 00:23:55.760
<v Speaker 1>but it's just a bad analogy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not all flowers.</v>

512
00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:58.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you're a flower a.</v>

513
00:23:58.250 --> 00:23:59.690
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I'm a flower.</v>

514
00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:02.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm a vegetable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some sort of.</v>

515
00:24:03.010 --> 00:24:04.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm already choke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have.</v>

516
00:24:04.311 --> 00:24:07.040
<v Speaker 1>Layers are great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love artichokes.</v>

517
00:24:07.041 --> 00:24:08.810
<v Speaker 1>I'm like a pineapple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm rough on the outside,</v>

518
00:24:08.811 --> 00:24:12.920
<v Speaker 1>but inside I'm delicious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the core is really hard as well.</v>

519
00:24:12.921 --> 00:24:14.960
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

520
00:24:15.050 --> 00:24:16.700
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's you deep inside.</v>

521
00:24:16.701 --> 00:24:19.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm very fibrous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once he gets good metaphor.</v>

522
00:24:19.250 --> 00:24:21.870
<v Speaker 1>I like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

523
00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:26.980
<v Speaker 1>so you were over there and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you continued your mixed martial arts </v>

524
00:24:26.980 --> 00:24:28.040
<v Speaker 1>training while you were over there as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Special Forces as a whole.</v>

526
00:24:30.390 --> 00:24:35.370
<v Speaker 2>Like there's the expectation that all of</v>
<v Speaker 2>us are just good fighters.</v>

527
00:24:35.371 --> 00:24:39.930
<v Speaker 2>Like we're just born bad asses that </v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously this is not the case,</v>

528
00:24:39.970 --> 00:24:41.070
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody is.</v>

529
00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:43.670
<v Speaker 2>So we train,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

530
00:24:43.740 --> 00:24:45.840
<v Speaker 2>we shoot all day long and morning and </v>
<v Speaker 2>night.</v>

531
00:24:45.841 --> 00:24:49.880
<v Speaker 2>We fight know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>usually pet is some form of Jujitsu,</v>

<v Speaker 2>hand to hand combat,</v>

534
00:24:52.471 --> 00:24:56.670
<v Speaker 2>small arms and then evening is more </v>
<v Speaker 2>recreational.</v>

535
00:24:56.700 --> 00:24:58.050
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after you get back from the rain show,</v>

536
00:24:58.051 --> 00:24:59.040
<v Speaker 2>you get up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you work out,</v>

537
00:24:59.430 --> 00:25:01.380
<v Speaker 2>then you go to the range and shoot for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

538
00:25:01.530 --> 00:25:02.370
<v Speaker 2>three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>four hours,</v>

539
00:25:02.371 --> 00:25:03.360
<v Speaker 2>go back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>clean the guns,</v>

540
00:25:03.361 --> 00:25:04.920
<v Speaker 2>and then your evening is usually on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>mat.</v>

541
00:25:05.310 --> 00:25:10.310
<v Speaker 2>That's Monday through Thursday.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Friday is you're trying to fix whatever </v>

542
00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:10.310
<v Speaker 2>you broke during the week.</v>

543
00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:12.990
<v Speaker 1>That's the week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So do you guys,</v>

544
00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:15.870
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they set up training for you,</v>

545
00:25:15.871 --> 00:25:19.260
<v Speaker 1>whether it's physical martial arts </v>
<v Speaker 1>training or fitness training,</v>

546
00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:23.850
<v Speaker 1>as is their instructors who are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who set a program for you?</v>

547
00:25:23.851 --> 00:25:24.840
<v Speaker 1>Like how does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how does it work?</v>

548
00:25:25.870 --> 00:25:29.000
<v Speaker 2>So sometimes you bring in experts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

549
00:25:29.110 --> 00:25:31.900
<v Speaker 2>hoists Gracie came in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trained us,</v>

550
00:25:31.930 --> 00:25:33.130
<v Speaker 2>I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>countless times,</v>

551
00:25:33.430 --> 00:25:35.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Greg Jackson comes out still,</v>

552
00:25:36.090 --> 00:25:36.830
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

553
00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:37.910
<v Speaker 2>guys like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

554
00:25:38.700 --> 00:25:40.550
<v Speaker 2>I'm Greg Thompson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

555
00:25:40.570 --> 00:25:43.000
<v Speaker 2>he's a hoist black belt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's there permanently.</v>

556
00:25:43.001 --> 00:25:48.001
<v Speaker 2>So there there's permanent fixtures at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the special forces installations that </v>

557
00:25:48.001 --> 00:25:51.640
<v Speaker 2>train guys on a daily basis and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>have relationships to bring in experts.</v>

558
00:25:51.970 --> 00:25:54.650
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously you know,</v>

559
00:25:54.670 --> 00:25:56.770
<v Speaker 2>what you do in a house when to blow a </v>
<v Speaker 2>door in,</v>

560
00:25:56.860 --> 00:25:59.530
<v Speaker 2>when you're going inside on kill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Capture mission is different than you're</v>

561
00:25:59.531 --> 00:26:04.531
<v Speaker 2>going to do in the cage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it has to be guys that can adapt </v>

562
00:26:04.531 --> 00:26:05.260
<v Speaker 2>whatever they're teaching or know what </v>
<v Speaker 2>their limitations are.</v>

563
00:26:05.261 --> 00:26:06.970
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Greg Jackson doesn't go in there and,</v>

564
00:26:07.030 --> 00:26:09.520
<v Speaker 2>and try to teach knife fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

565
00:26:09.521 --> 00:26:11.140
<v Speaker 2>he knows what his left and right limits </v>
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>

566
00:26:11.141 --> 00:26:11.740
<v Speaker 2>but he comes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

567

<v Speaker 2>he's one of the best.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he comes in and gives,</v>

568
00:26:13.540 --> 00:26:17.190
<v Speaker 2>gives the best instruction that he can </v>
<v Speaker 2>to try to provide tools for,</v>

569
00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:22.520
<v Speaker 2>for guys to be better at what they do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You train a lot down there in </v>

570
00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:22.520
<v Speaker 2>Albuquerque?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do,</v>

571

<v Speaker 2>He's a fascinating guy.</v>

572
00:26:22.930 --> 00:26:24.490
<v Speaker 2>He is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he is a cool cat.</v>

573
00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:28.120
<v Speaker 1>He's a one of a very unique dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like really humble,</v>

574
00:26:28.121 --> 00:26:33.121
<v Speaker 1>like really humble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a lot of people that </v>

575
00:26:33.121 --> 00:26:33.170
<v Speaker 1>pretend to be humble,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you took away Adam,</v>

576
00:26:33.490 --> 00:26:35.610
<v Speaker 1>you pick away at them and you find some </v>
<v Speaker 1>bullshit.</v>

577

<v Speaker 2>I thought I did too,</v>

673
00:30:40.630 --> 00:30:45.630
<v Speaker 2>but it was close and there was just </v>
<v Speaker 2>small adjustments I needed to make and </v>

674
00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:47.980
<v Speaker 2>adjustments that w that I wasn't making </v>
<v Speaker 2>on my own.</v>

675
00:30:48.570 --> 00:30:53.570
<v Speaker 2>I needed somebody that was smarter than </v>
<v Speaker 2>me to tell me what those were and how </v>

676
00:30:53.570 --> 00:30:55.330

680
00:30:59.940 --> 00:31:04.410
<v Speaker 1>you Jackson is an interesting guy in </v>
<v Speaker 1>that he didn't have any professional mma</v>

681
00:31:04.411 --> 00:31:06.800
<v Speaker 1>fights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's a virtuoso.</v>

682
00:31:06.870 --> 00:31:11.870
<v Speaker 1>I mean he really is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had long conversations with him </v>

683

686
00:31:19.270 --> 00:31:21.660
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the changing rhythm of a fight.</v>

687
00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:27.030
<v Speaker 2>He looks at everything as strategy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's like he's playing lemmings,</v>

688
00:31:27.330 --> 00:31:29.110
<v Speaker 2>like the old school lemmings,</v>

<v Speaker 2>it's very like archaic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like 16 bit game from like almost </v>

694
00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:44.650
<v Speaker 2>commodore 64 type things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

695
00:31:44.700 --> 00:31:46.830
<v Speaker 2>Like he still plays stat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not often,</v>

696
00:31:46.890 --> 00:31:47.660
<v Speaker 2>but he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

697
00:31:47.670 --> 00:31:51.150
<v Speaker 2>everything has strategy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's chess or backgammon,</v>

698
00:31:51.180 --> 00:31:56.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or if he's like playing monopoly with a </v>

699
00:31:56.180 --> 00:31:56.180
<v Speaker 2>family,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

700
00:31:56.180 --> 00:31:57.670
<v Speaker 2>it's like everything's about strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nope.</v>

701
00:31:57.800 --> 00:31:59.760
<v Speaker 1>We had a conversation with my friend </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ari,</v>

702
00:31:59.790 --> 00:32:03.390
<v Speaker 1>my friend Ari Shaffir has a podcast </v>
<v Speaker 1>called the skeptic tank and our,</v>

703
00:32:03.450 --> 00:32:05.970
<v Speaker 1>he's a really smart dude and him and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Greg Jackson.</v>

704
00:32:05.971 --> 00:32:10.900
<v Speaker 1>Greg was his guest and Greg was like </v>
<v Speaker 1>picking his brain about the comparisons,</v>

705
00:32:11.030 --> 00:32:16.030
<v Speaker 1>like trying to figure out how one crafts</v>
<v Speaker 1>a piece of comedy and like tries to </v>

706
00:32:16.030 --> 00:32:17.820
<v Speaker 1>attack an audience with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how you,</v>

707
00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:22.650
<v Speaker 1>how you get an idea past the boundaries </v>
<v Speaker 1>of someone's consciousness.</v>

708
00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:24.050
<v Speaker 1>Could that be adaptive?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

709
00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:29.600
<v Speaker 2>When you're talking to this audience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you already have the template of what </v>

710
00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:30.150
<v Speaker 2>you're trying to get to them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then your response,</v>

711
00:32:30.170 --> 00:32:31.720
<v Speaker 2>their responsiveness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can you,</v>

712
00:32:31.790 --> 00:32:36.790
<v Speaker 2>can it change?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I envisioned that is exactly </v>

713
00:32:36.790 --> 00:32:36.790
<v Speaker 2>something that Greg would do.</v>

714
00:32:36.790 --> 00:32:36.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

715
00:32:36.790 --> 00:32:38.900
<v Speaker 1>It's fascinating to listen to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to his,</v>

716
00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:39.980
<v Speaker 1>his mind because</v>

717
00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:43.490
<v Speaker 3>I don't know anybody like him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a very unique sort of a mindset.</v>

718
00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:49.120
<v Speaker 3>And then Winkeljohn who's a great </v>
<v Speaker 3>striking coach was a great kick boxer </v>

719
00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:49.120
<v Speaker 3>himself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

720
00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:50.480
<v Speaker 3>he's an interesting guy too.</v>

721
00:32:50.590 --> 00:32:53.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like the Yin to the Yang with Greg,</v>

722
00:32:53.321 --> 00:32:53.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>

723
00:32:53.860 --> 00:32:55.180
<v Speaker 2>he's a linear thinker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

724
00:32:55.181 --> 00:32:59.750
<v Speaker 2>he's um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he knows what you like,</v>

725
00:32:59.751 --> 00:33:03.040
<v Speaker 2>what Greg wants you to paint the best </v>
<v Speaker 2>version of yourself.</v>

726
00:33:03.250 --> 00:33:08.250
<v Speaker 2>I'm winkle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>John doesn't have that kind of </v>

727
00:33:08.250 --> 00:33:12.180
<v Speaker 2>responsive approach to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He knows what you need to do to be </v>

728
00:33:12.180 --> 00:33:12.180
<v Speaker 2>better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

729
00:33:12.180 --> 00:33:14.050
<v Speaker 2>and he says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what you should do to be better.</v>

730
00:33:14.051 --> 00:33:16.780
<v Speaker 2>And this is what we're going to drill it</v>
<v Speaker 2>relentlessly until your,</v>

731
00:33:17.100 --> 00:33:17.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Greg's like,</v>

732
00:33:17.831 --> 00:33:20.920
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I want to see you develop this.</v>

733
00:33:20.921 --> 00:33:24.430
<v Speaker 2>Let me give you some tools so you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>implement this in your fighting style.</v>

734
00:33:24.790 --> 00:33:29.790
<v Speaker 2>And it's going to be adaptive to every </v>
<v Speaker 2>single different athletes that he has </v>

735
00:33:29.790 --> 00:33:29.790
<v Speaker 2>where winkle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>John's like,</v>

736
00:33:29.790 --> 00:33:29.790
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what you need to do.</v>

737
00:33:29.790 --> 00:33:30.640
<v Speaker 2>And this is how we're going to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>

738
00:33:30.970 --> 00:33:32.290
<v Speaker 2>yes sir,</v>
<v Speaker 2>please don't hurt me.</v>

739
00:33:32.430 --> 00:33:37.430
<v Speaker 3>You know what I do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I look at what do I look at for folks </v>

740
00:33:37.430 --> 00:33:38.480
<v Speaker 3>who don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he lost an eye in training.</v>

741
00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:39.830
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone,</v>

742
00:33:39.850 --> 00:33:42.970
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they threw a kick and the toenail missed</v>

743
00:33:43.060 --> 00:33:48.060
<v Speaker 3>the pad and caught his eyeball,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is the first I've ever heard of </v>

744
00:33:48.060 --> 00:33:48.100
<v Speaker 3>that happening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>However,</v>

745
00:33:48.470 --> 00:33:51.980
<v Speaker 3>I've heard of guys getting scratched </v>
<v Speaker 3>badly and training from sparring,</v>

746
00:33:51.981 --> 00:33:56.981
<v Speaker 3>but never from holding pads.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He wears safety glasses every time he </v>

747
00:33:56.981 --> 00:33:58.140
<v Speaker 3>holds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now we asked him,</v>

748
00:33:59.300 --> 00:34:01.130
<v Speaker 3>can you see anything out of that other?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

<v Speaker 3>definitely not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

750
00:34:02.660 --> 00:34:03.230
<v Speaker 3>That the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the.</v>

751
00:34:03.250 --> 00:34:06.150
<v Speaker 3>I like poured out of his face.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was like,</v>

752

<v Speaker 3>that's.</v>

<v Speaker 3>and file them bitches to cut them.</v>

767
00:34:44.930 --> 00:34:47.450
<v Speaker 3>And then there's rough edges.</v>
<v Speaker 3>File those bitches down.</v>

768
00:34:47.930 --> 00:34:52.930
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>You don't bite them down.</v>

773
00:34:57.561 --> 00:34:59.210
<v Speaker 3>Now you should have done that already.</v>

774
00:34:59.490 --> 00:35:02.900
<v Speaker 2>Then you come home and your wife's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why do you have scratches all over you?</v>

775
00:35:02.901 --> 00:35:03.200
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>

776
00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:08.800
<v Speaker 3>I fight for a living.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's hilarious.</v>

777
00:35:10.161 --> 00:35:13.610
<v Speaker 3>Why are they on your back?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because someone who's fucking scratching</v>

778
00:35:13.611 --> 00:35:18.380
<v Speaker 3>my back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't want them to the moon.</v>

779
00:35:18.410 --> 00:35:22.390
<v Speaker 3>Scratches o Tim.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

780
00:35:22.460 --> 00:35:24.710
<v Speaker 3>more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>More?</v>

781
00:35:25.700 --> 00:35:26.840
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not Good.</v>

782
00:35:26.920 --> 00:35:29.510
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is there a solution for fucking it pokes</v>

783
00:35:30.380 --> 00:35:31.360
<v Speaker 3>gloves?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

784
00:35:31.370 --> 00:35:36.370
<v Speaker 3>What should be done?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Heaven forbid we ever say that anything </v>

785
00:35:36.370 --> 00:35:36.920
<v Speaker 3>was done better and pride.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Their gloves are,</v>

786
00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:37.940
<v Speaker 3>they're better,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

787
00:35:38.130 --> 00:35:39.210
<v Speaker 2>They're better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're curved.</v>

788
00:35:39.510 --> 00:35:42.840
<v Speaker 2>Got like how many guys right now do you </v>
<v Speaker 2>see with broken hands?</v>

789
00:35:42.870 --> 00:35:44.400
<v Speaker 2>A lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like tons of them.</v>

790
00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:48.510
<v Speaker 2>So we have this padding on the two </v>
<v Speaker 2>thirds of our hands.</v>

791
00:35:48.511 --> 00:35:53.511
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's not where we break our </v>

792
00:35:53.511 --> 00:35:53.511
<v Speaker 2>hands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We break her hands in the metacarpals in</v>

793
00:35:53.511 --> 00:35:54.080
<v Speaker 2>the back of the wrist or just above the </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrist of the bottom.</v>

794
00:35:54.100 --> 00:35:58.410
<v Speaker 2>Your hand pride gloves had padding there</v>
<v Speaker 2>which provided support.</v>

795
00:35:58.740 --> 00:36:00.840
<v Speaker 2>So it's a lot harder to break your </v>
<v Speaker 2>hands.</v>

796
00:36:01.090 --> 00:36:06.090
<v Speaker 2>There are also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the pattern was curved so it was </v>

797
00:36:06.090 --> 00:36:06.090
<v Speaker 2>actually actually had to straighten </v>
<v Speaker 2>your.</v>

798
00:36:06.090 --> 00:36:07.400
<v Speaker 2>I'm a grappler obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

799
00:36:07.401 --> 00:36:12.401
<v Speaker 2>like I like to grapple.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So as a grappler I could complain that </v>

800
00:36:12.401 --> 00:36:15.180
<v Speaker 2>like I want to have the total use of my </v>
<v Speaker 2>extremities.</v>

801
00:36:15.890 --> 00:36:20.890
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No gloves would be better for most </v>

802
00:36:20.890 --> 00:36:20.890
<v Speaker 3>grappler.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

803
00:36:20.890 --> 00:36:21.220
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could slide things in better you.</v>

804
00:36:21.221 --> 00:36:22.970
<v Speaker 3>I said I don't want to get poked in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>eye.</v>

805
00:36:23.420 --> 00:36:26.210
<v Speaker 3>So the pride gloves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's how we make them better.</v>

806
00:36:26.540 --> 00:36:31.540
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why we own pride the UFC owns and just </v>

807
00:36:31.540 --> 00:36:33.380
<v Speaker 3>take the word slide off of it and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>put those three letters on there.</v>

808
00:36:33.410 --> 00:36:34.040
<v Speaker 3>Bam.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

809
00:36:34.050 --> 00:36:36.380
<v Speaker 3>They brought some new glove and they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

810
00:36:36.381 --> 00:36:38.120
<v Speaker 3>here's the new glove,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I put it on.</v>

811
00:36:38.121 --> 00:36:38.600
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why?</v>

812
00:36:38.601 --> 00:36:41.720
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck is the difference?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just slightly curved,</v>

813
00:36:41.930 --> 00:36:44.150
<v Speaker 3>like these bitches should be like really</v>
<v Speaker 3>curved,</v>

814
00:36:44.180 --> 00:36:49.180
<v Speaker 3>like whereas if you want to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it said an effort and when you relax it </v>

815
00:36:49.180 --> 00:36:51.710
<v Speaker 3>goes right back to that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The effort is for 15 to 25 minutes.</v>

816
00:36:51.850 --> 00:36:55.910
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm sure my hand is strong enough </v>
<v Speaker 3>to go like that when I need it to for 15</v>

817
00:36:55.911 --> 00:36:56.750
<v Speaker 3>to 25 minutes.</v>

818
00:36:56.810 --> 00:37:00.110
<v Speaker 3>Well I mean as long as you can do it </v>
<v Speaker 3>when certain situations like,</v>

819
00:37:00.130 --> 00:37:01.910
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you try and apply a choke or something,</v>

820
00:37:01.911 --> 00:37:06.911
<v Speaker 3>but it's very disheartening to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All the people that are having detached </v>

821
00:37:07.101 --> 00:37:10.320
<v Speaker 3>retinas and Alan Belcher's was fucked up</v>
<v Speaker 3>my.</v>

822
00:37:10.540 --> 00:37:14.600
<v Speaker 3>I mean bisping bisping Xyz off looked at</v>
<v Speaker 3>him in the eye when we were like,</v>

823
00:37:14.980 --> 00:37:18.080
<v Speaker 3>well he's an oil in the oil and is high.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

824
00:37:18.090 --> 00:37:19.070
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

825
00:37:19.730 --> 00:37:22.100
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what he can see out of it </v>
<v Speaker 3>or what it looks like.</v>

826
00:37:22.101 --> 00:37:24.440
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess it's diminished in some respect.</v>

827
00:37:24.470 --> 00:37:26.240
<v Speaker 3>Has to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

828
00:37:26.241 --> 00:37:28.610
<v Speaker 3>It's so fucking weird and he's had a </v>
<v Speaker 3>couple of surgeries,</v>

829
00:37:28.611 --> 00:37:30.440
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bisping's had more than one ice surgery.</v>

830
00:37:30.550 --> 00:37:31.910
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

831
00:37:32.630 --> 00:37:34.640
<v Speaker 3>I don't want them there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need them.</v>

832
00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:38.210
<v Speaker 3>Is it possible to do something where the</v>
<v Speaker 3>fingers aren't exposed,</v>

833
00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:39.810
<v Speaker 3>like chop them off?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

834
00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:40.280
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

835
00:37:40.490 --> 00:37:43.610
<v Speaker 3>I'm talking about like covering like </v>
<v Speaker 3>what I was thinking of is like a,</v>

836
00:37:43.790 --> 00:37:47.270
<v Speaker 3>like a lamb skin sort of uncovering </v>
<v Speaker 3>something is not thick,</v>

837
00:37:47.271 --> 00:37:51.080
<v Speaker 3>but like maybe like a band around the </v>
<v Speaker 3>tips where you,</v>

838
00:37:51.130 --> 00:37:53.660
<v Speaker 3>you don't really do this ever anyway.</v>

839
00:37:53.960 --> 00:37:58.960
<v Speaker 3>Know do you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>When do you do that body lock takedown </v>

840
00:37:58.960 --> 00:37:58.960
<v Speaker 3>of stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You grabbed like this?</v>

841
00:37:58.960 --> 00:37:59.450
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

842
00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:00.360
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you do this.</v>

843
00:38:00.500 --> 00:38:03.250
<v Speaker 3>You still have this or this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

844
00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:04.730
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you mostly do this?</v>

845
00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:05.750
<v Speaker 3>Let's design it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

846
00:38:05.751 --> 00:38:07.790
<v Speaker 3>well I'm saying what I'm for folks who </v>
<v Speaker 3>are listening,</v>

847
00:38:07.970 --> 00:38:12.970
<v Speaker 3>there's a thing called the gable grip </v>
<v Speaker 3>and with the way a gable grip works is </v>

848
00:38:12.970 --> 00:38:16.960
<v Speaker 3>picture your hand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're going to karate chop someone </v>

849
00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:18.941
<v Speaker 3>in your fingers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your thumb was pressed tightly against </v>

850
00:38:18.941 --> 00:38:21.711
<v Speaker 3>society or hand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then have your hands like in across </v>

851
00:38:21.711 --> 00:38:25.780
<v Speaker 3>position where one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one sideways and one is a sitting </v>

852
00:38:25.780 --> 00:38:26.990
<v Speaker 3>straight up and then crushed down with </v>
<v Speaker 3>your hands,</v>

853
00:38:27.110 --> 00:38:28.610
<v Speaker 3>with your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with your fingertips.</v>

854
00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:33.890
<v Speaker 3>That would be what a gable grip is like </v>
<v Speaker 3>and that is the majority of wrestling of</v>

855
00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:36.040
<v Speaker 3>grabbing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you you sent around the</v>

856
00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:41.040
<v Speaker 1>waist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's most of the way you grabbed the </v>

857
00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:42.640
<v Speaker 1>other way would be an escrip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is you would make like an like 69,</v>

858
00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:44.220
<v Speaker 1>69.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

859
00:38:44.230 --> 00:38:47.940
<v Speaker 1>Ian and Yang.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're more uncouth or couth and you,</v>

860
00:38:48.120 --> 00:38:53.120
<v Speaker 1>you grabbed like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you never very rarely do you do </v>

861
00:38:53.120 --> 00:38:55.771
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very rarely do you let your fingers </v>

862
00:38:55.771 --> 00:38:55.771
<v Speaker 1>intersect with each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it just doesn't.</v>

863
00:38:55.771 --> 00:38:59.230
<v Speaker 1>They don't have to be free like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when they're free,</v>

864
00:38:59.231 --> 00:39:01.640
<v Speaker 1>that's when fingers go and eyeballs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

865
00:39:02.650 --> 00:39:07.650
<v Speaker 1>I thought maybe like maybe there could </v>
<v Speaker 1>be some sort of a flexible rounded </v>

866
00:39:07.650 --> 00:39:10.930
<v Speaker 1>covering which would eliminate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seems like they've had to have tried it,</v>

867
00:39:10.931 --> 00:39:12.460
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they have.</v>

868
00:39:12.630 --> 00:39:14.030
<v Speaker 1>Let's give it a whirl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

869
00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:18.850
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing to me how things just stay </v>
<v Speaker 1>stagnant when they're retarded.</v>

870
00:39:19.180 --> 00:39:24.180
<v Speaker 1>Like when they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't make any sense like these </v>

871
00:39:24.180 --> 00:39:24.180
<v Speaker 1>gloves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So 12 to six elbow.</v>

872
00:39:24.180 --> 00:39:24.900
<v Speaker 1>I love those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why can't we do those?</v>

873
00:39:24.930 --> 00:39:27.850
<v Speaker 1>This should be at ease to the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

874
00:39:27.970 --> 00:39:32.020
<v Speaker 1>Well you telling me you can kick someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the head with your Shin,</v>

875
00:39:32.530 --> 00:39:34.810
<v Speaker 1>but you can't drop an elbow down your </v>
<v Speaker 1>head.</v>

876
00:39:34.930 --> 00:39:37.240
<v Speaker 1>Someone has never been kicked in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>head with a shin.</v>

877
00:39:37.340 --> 00:39:42.340
<v Speaker 1>Obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the only reason why you would </v>

878
00:39:42.340 --> 00:39:42.340
<v Speaker 1>make that really think John Mccain for </v>
<v Speaker 1>this one,</v>

879
00:39:42.340 --> 00:39:42.340
<v Speaker 1>wasn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That like that.</v>

880
00:39:42.340 --> 00:39:46.950
<v Speaker 1>That era was that era according to John </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mccarthy who was there when it was all </v>

881
00:39:46.950 --> 00:39:47.750
<v Speaker 1>going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>John McCarthy,</v>

882
00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:49.360
<v Speaker 1>famous referee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the gold standard.</v>

883
00:39:49.470 --> 00:39:50.770
<v Speaker 1>That guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great guy.</v>

884
00:39:50.890 --> 00:39:55.890
<v Speaker 1>Big John told me that they were having </v>
<v Speaker 1>this meeting with the athletic </v>

885
00:39:55.890 --> 00:40:00.100
<v Speaker 1>commission and they had seen like karate</v>
<v Speaker 1>brick breaking demonstrations on espn at</v>

886
00:40:00.101 --> 00:40:05.101
<v Speaker 1>like 2:00</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the morning and the board's shatter </v>

887
00:40:05.101 --> 00:40:08.791
<v Speaker 1>and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well they said you can't do that move </v>

888
00:40:08.791 --> 00:40:09.250
<v Speaker 1>because that move could kill someone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

889
00:40:09.250 --> 00:40:12.310
<v Speaker 1>If you can break bricks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can obviously break somebody's neck.</v>

890
00:40:12.340 --> 00:40:13.660
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And just blow.</v>

891
00:40:13.780 --> 00:40:18.780
<v Speaker 1>This is the real reason why the 12 to </v>
<v Speaker 1>six elbow is illegal,</v>

892
00:40:19.540 --> 00:40:23.860
<v Speaker 1>but arguably this elbow is stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Definitely.</v>

893
00:40:23.900 --> 00:40:25.690
<v Speaker 1>It's got more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more torque to it.</v>

894
00:40:25.691 --> 00:40:27.130
<v Speaker 1>It's a more natural movement of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>body.</v>

895
00:40:27.310 --> 00:40:29.650
<v Speaker 1>This is an awkward movement in </v>
<v Speaker 1>comparison.</v>

896
00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:32.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean the Cobra Kai,</v>

897
00:40:32.870 --> 00:40:35.200
<v Speaker 1>Daniel's son watched those guys breaking</v>
<v Speaker 1>boards.</v>

898
00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:41.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's tough to argue with that kind of </v>

899
00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:42.631
<v Speaker 1>logic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is the logic that literally is </v>

900
00:40:42.631 --> 00:40:42.631
<v Speaker 1>complete pure ignorance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you.</v>

901
00:40:42.631 --> 00:40:46.360
<v Speaker 1>If you asked like mixed martial arts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a competitor's trainers,</v>

902
00:40:46.390 --> 00:40:48.490
<v Speaker 1>fighters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people in the know and as them,</v>

903
00:40:48.491 --> 00:40:53.491
<v Speaker 1>which would be illegal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the 12 slash six elbow is not going to </v>

904
00:40:53.491 --> 00:40:53.491
<v Speaker 1>be on that list.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No where near.</v>

905
00:40:53.491 --> 00:40:54.550
<v Speaker 1>It's a fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a.</v>

906
00:40:54.590 --> 00:40:59.590
<v Speaker 1>it's a good technique.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's excellent as our knees on the </v>

907
00:40:59.590 --> 00:41:00.490
<v Speaker 1>ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think knees on the ground and it could</v>

908
00:41:00.491 --> 00:41:01.480
<v Speaker 1>be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

909
00:41:01.481 --> 00:41:03.880
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if someone wanted to have some sort of a</v>

910
00:41:03.910 --> 00:41:08.910
<v Speaker 1>compromise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it would be knees on the ground </v>

911
00:41:08.910 --> 00:41:08.910
<v Speaker 1>when you're not pressed up against the </v>
<v Speaker 1>cage.</v>

912
00:41:08.910 --> 00:41:10.370
<v Speaker 1>That could be a possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

913
00:41:10.490 --> 00:41:15.490
<v Speaker 1>the idea being that the niece of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>head on the ground would be problematic </v>

914
00:41:15.490 --> 00:41:19.831
<v Speaker 1>against the cage because the guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't move and that was one of the </v>

915
00:41:19.831 --> 00:41:21.280
<v Speaker 1>good things about pride was the ropes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If soccer kicks and all those things,</v>

916
00:41:21.281 --> 00:41:24.250
<v Speaker 1>you can kind of scoot your head under </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ropes to get away from things you're</v>

917
00:41:24.251 --> 00:41:29.251
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not contained by your </v>

918
00:41:29.251 --> 00:41:31.141
<v Speaker 1>environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And to the point where you would suffer </v>

919
00:41:31.141 --> 00:41:32.650
<v Speaker 1>a damaging blow that you could have </v>
<v Speaker 1>avoided by your own power.</v>

920
00:41:33.030 --> 00:41:33.900
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>outside of like</v>

921
00:41:34.580 --> 00:41:37.550
<v Speaker 3>the north south 69 position for knees to</v>
<v Speaker 3>the head on the ground.</v>

922
00:41:37.580 --> 00:41:38.940
<v Speaker 3>That's the only position I could think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

923
00:41:38.990 --> 00:41:43.990
<v Speaker 3>like obviously the limitation is you </v>
<v Speaker 3>still can't strike to the top of the </v>

924
00:41:43.990 --> 00:41:47.591
<v Speaker 3>head or the back of the head with a knee</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that under that premise then it </v>

925
00:41:47.591 --> 00:41:48.170
<v Speaker 3>doesn't really matter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

926
00:41:48.330 --> 00:41:53.330
<v Speaker 3>we need somebody from.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because you can't hurt them any worse </v>

927
00:41:53.330 --> 00:41:54.650
<v Speaker 3>than you could in any other way with any</v>
<v Speaker 3>other strike from any other position.</v>

928
00:41:55.250 --> 00:42:00.250
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and also I don't like this thing that </v>

929
00:42:00.250 --> 00:42:01.190
<v Speaker 3>guys are doing with a drop one hand down</v>
<v Speaker 3>to avoid.</v>

930
00:42:01.220 --> 00:42:03.800
<v Speaker 3>But they had and they picked it up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>drop it down like,</v>

931
00:42:03.830 --> 00:42:04.420
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's game.</v>

932
00:42:04.430 --> 00:42:06.170
<v Speaker 3>Play this down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>down,</v>

933
00:42:06.340 --> 00:42:07.850
<v Speaker 3>down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't need me.</v>

934
00:42:08.090 --> 00:42:08.830
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm up.</v>

935
00:42:09.140 --> 00:42:09.620
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

936
00:42:09.900 --> 00:42:11.720
<v Speaker 3>it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very weird.</v>

937
00:42:11.780 --> 00:42:16.780
<v Speaker 3>It's just a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a weird gray area that I think </v>

938
00:42:16.780 --> 00:42:16.780
<v Speaker 3>needs to be sat down.</v>

939
00:42:16.780 --> 00:42:19.970
<v Speaker 3>And then of course there's the scoring </v>
<v Speaker 3>system which is adopted from boxing this</v>

940
00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:24.230
<v Speaker 3>10 point scoring system,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is just terrible.</v>

941
00:42:24.231 --> 00:42:29.010
<v Speaker 3>And the implementation of it is even </v>
<v Speaker 3>more terrible because very few 10,</v>

942
00:42:29.030 --> 00:42:30.410
<v Speaker 3>eight rounds get scored.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

943
00:42:30.670 --> 00:42:32.120
<v Speaker 3>I mean I've rarely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's 10,</v>

944
00:42:32.121 --> 00:42:34.730
<v Speaker 3>nine rounds that are squeakers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

945
00:42:34.731 --> 00:42:36.090
<v Speaker 3>Like maybe one of your rounds with </v>
<v Speaker 3>Jacques,</v>

946
00:42:36.100 --> 00:42:36.980
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Might've been at 10,</v>

947
00:42:36.990 --> 00:42:41.990
<v Speaker 3>nine round and then there's 10,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nine rounds where a guy just gets </v>

948
00:42:41.990 --> 00:42:44.670
<v Speaker 3>fucking molly [inaudible] dropped to </v>
<v Speaker 3>three times 10,</v>

949
00:42:44.680 --> 00:42:47.090
<v Speaker 3>nine round.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like how is that possible?</v>

950
00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:52.600
<v Speaker 3>It's a terrible system and I don't know </v>
<v Speaker 3>if you ever saw doc Hamilton's scoring </v>

951
00:42:52.600 --> 00:42:54.950
<v Speaker 3>system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had a half point scoring system,</v>

952
00:42:54.951 --> 00:42:56.780
<v Speaker 3>which is much more better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Way Better.</v>

953
00:42:56.781 --> 00:43:01.250
<v Speaker 3>I would want doc Hamilton's and to know </v>
<v Speaker 3>what the scores are every road.</v>

954
00:43:01.310 --> 00:43:03.200
<v Speaker 3>I agree 100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>

955
00:43:03.260 --> 00:43:05.210
<v Speaker 3>Every other fucking game,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's football,</v>

956
00:43:05.211 --> 00:43:06.560
<v Speaker 3>basketball,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything else.</v>

957
00:43:06.740 --> 00:43:08.300
<v Speaker 3>I think it should be that way in boxing </v>
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>

958
00:43:08.301 --> 00:43:11.990
<v Speaker 3>So it would discourage shitty judges </v>
<v Speaker 3>from continuing their.</v>

959
00:43:11.991 --> 00:43:16.991
<v Speaker 3>Their shittiness Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And shitty fighters from continuing </v>

960
00:43:16.991 --> 00:43:16.991
<v Speaker 3>their shittiness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

961
00:43:16.991 --> 00:43:21.580
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the only real worry would be that guy </v>

962
00:43:21.580 --> 00:43:21.920
<v Speaker 3>would be so far ahead that he would run </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the last round.</v>

963
00:43:21.921 --> 00:43:24.830
<v Speaker 3>He's up for rounds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>John Jones move into fifth round against</v>

964
00:43:24.831 --> 00:43:26.930
<v Speaker 3>glover was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>alright,</v>

965
00:43:27.020 --> 00:43:32.020
<v Speaker 3>I have this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but a guy like John wouldn't do that </v>

966
00:43:32.020 --> 00:43:32.020
<v Speaker 3>anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

967
00:43:32.020 --> 00:43:34.490
<v Speaker 3>The great fighters would still fight the</v>
<v Speaker 3>same and that not only that,</v>

968
00:43:34.491 --> 00:43:39.491
<v Speaker 3>the other guy is going to get more </v>
<v Speaker 3>desperate so it'll make it even more </v>

969
00:43:39.491 --> 00:43:40.100
<v Speaker 3>exciting because he's going to have to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if he doesn't like,</v>

970
00:43:40.101 --> 00:43:41.570
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>will you not trying to win.</v>

971
00:43:41.750 --> 00:43:43.280
<v Speaker 3>Like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not going to win a decision,</v>

972
00:43:43.281 --> 00:43:48.281
<v Speaker 3>so either you just fucking throw caution</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the wind and throw yourself in the </v>

973
00:43:48.281 --> 00:43:49.130
<v Speaker 3>line of fire or why you fighting.</v>

974
00:43:49.610 --> 00:43:50.390
<v Speaker 3>Move on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

975
00:43:50.391 --> 00:43:53.840
<v Speaker 3>Move on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>John Jones is a fucking phenomenon,</v>

976
00:43:53.841 --> 00:43:56.180
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That dude is good.</v>

977
00:43:56.181 --> 00:44:00.570
<v Speaker 3>As he has looked in the past,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fight against glover was just,</v>

978
00:44:01.080 --> 00:44:03.400
<v Speaker 3>just sensation was masterful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>

979
00:44:03.410 --> 00:44:04.850
<v Speaker 3>it was something to behold.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

980
00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:07.670
<v Speaker 3>he's amazing to the gym.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>

981
00:44:07.700 --> 00:44:10.040
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's so talented in every respect,</v>

982
00:44:10.041 --> 00:44:15.041
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like even I've been doing Jujitsu for </v>

983
00:44:15.041 --> 00:44:15.041
<v Speaker 3>forever and he's good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's really,</v>

984
00:44:15.041 --> 00:44:19.841
<v Speaker 3>really good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then like stand up as a whole </v>

985
00:44:19.841 --> 00:44:19.841
<v Speaker 3>different world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His wrestling is just out of this world,</v>

986
00:44:19.841 --> 00:44:24.281
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then he goes on game day on fight </v>

987
00:44:24.281 --> 00:44:25.370
<v Speaker 3>day and he's better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He improvises today.</v>

988
00:44:25.380 --> 00:44:26.330
<v Speaker 3>It's beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

989
00:44:26.331 --> 00:44:31.331
<v Speaker 3>When,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I asked him about the elbows in </v>

990
00:44:31.331 --> 00:44:32.130
<v Speaker 3>tight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like fighting glover against the cage</v>

991
00:44:32.130 --> 00:44:35.190
<v Speaker 1>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew I just had a fucking feeling that</v>

992
00:44:35.191 --> 00:44:36.660
<v Speaker 1>he was improvising,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I was like,</v>

993
00:44:36.661 --> 00:44:38.280
<v Speaker 1>is this something you planned as like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

994
00:44:38.290 --> 00:44:40.830
<v Speaker 1>I just felt it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was winding up and I just felt like I</v>

995
00:44:40.831 --> 00:44:41.580
<v Speaker 1>could get away with that.</v>

996
00:44:42.670 --> 00:44:47.670
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're in fight camp are the exact same </v>

997
00:44:47.670 --> 00:44:47.670
<v Speaker 2>time I fought one week before him and </v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

998
00:44:48.290 --> 00:44:49.500
<v Speaker 2>he did drill those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

999
00:44:49.501 --> 00:44:51.470
<v Speaker 2>like we're watching out for glover's big</v>
<v Speaker 2>overhand.</v>

1000
00:44:51.471 --> 00:44:52.060
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1001
00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:55.130
<v Speaker 2>obviously we're looking for the two big,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the two,</v>

1002
00:44:55.131 --> 00:44:57.350
<v Speaker 2>three punch combos that he doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>entrances,</v>

1003
00:44:57.351 --> 00:44:58.520
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>watching of course for her,</v>

1004
00:44:58.550 --> 00:45:00.350
<v Speaker 2>for glover's wrestling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a beast on top.</v>

1005
00:45:00.880 --> 00:45:05.880
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you watched the fight and </v>

1006
00:45:05.880 --> 00:45:06.530
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he didn't do that stuff in fight camp.</v>

1007
00:45:06.710 --> 00:45:11.710
<v Speaker 2>He just fight night,</v>
<v Speaker 2>started improvising and destroying the </v>

1008
00:45:11.710 --> 00:45:14.330
<v Speaker 2>still number two dude on the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So decisive leader.</v>

1009
00:45:14.331 --> 00:45:16.150
<v Speaker 2>It's disturbing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He also added in</v>

1010
00:45:16.230 --> 00:45:17.730
<v Speaker 1>new thing to his game that I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna.</v>

1011
00:45:17.740 --> 00:45:19.270
<v Speaker 1>See a lot of people do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

1012
00:45:19.271 --> 00:45:21.770
<v Speaker 1>that attacking the shoulder with that </v>
<v Speaker 1>loose underhook.</v>

1013
00:45:22.060 --> 00:45:25.270
<v Speaker 1>When a guy has that relax under hook and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you yank that arm up,</v>

1014
00:45:25.500 --> 00:45:30.500
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he fucked glover shoulder up in the </v>

1015
00:45:30.500 --> 00:45:30.500
<v Speaker 1>first one</v>

1016
00:45:30.500 --> 00:45:30.500
<v Speaker 2>round.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Never really recovered.</v>

1017
00:45:30.500 --> 00:45:34.020
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it changed the whole feeling of what </v>

1018
00:45:34.020 --> 00:45:34.020
<v Speaker 2>glover could do offensively from that </v>
<v Speaker 2>point forward.</v>

1019
00:45:34.020 --> 00:45:34.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

1020
00:45:34.260 --> 00:45:39.260
<v Speaker 1>he was mangled and now you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his Labor was towards the surgery and </v>

1021
00:45:39.260 --> 00:45:39.520
<v Speaker 1>surgery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1022
00:45:40.060 --> 00:45:45.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>John's done a lot of things that a lot </v>

1023
00:45:45.060 --> 00:45:45.970
<v Speaker 1>of people implement now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The front leg side kick to the thigh and</v>

1024
00:45:46.270 --> 00:45:48.210
<v Speaker 1>it was very few people doing that before</v>
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

1025
00:45:48.310 --> 00:45:53.310
<v Speaker 1>Everybody does it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got to watch the finger pokes </v>

1026
00:45:53.310 --> 00:45:53.310
<v Speaker 1>though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1027
00:45:53.310 --> 00:45:56.880
<v Speaker 1>John has always doing that thing where </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's extending his hands and you guys </v>

1028
00:45:56.880 --> 00:46:01.200
<v Speaker 1>trying to move forward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They wind up running into his fingers </v>

1029
00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:01.200
<v Speaker 1>all the time.</v>

1030
00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:03.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really do believe I hate finger pokes </v>

1031
00:46:04.340 --> 00:46:09.340
<v Speaker 2>knee to the groin when guys get tired,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cage grabbing like don't like it at all.</v>

1032
00:46:09.341 --> 00:46:11.050
<v Speaker 2>So He's a teammate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1033
00:46:11.350 --> 00:46:14.530
<v Speaker 2>I really do believe that he doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>intend to hit them in the eyes.</v>

1034
00:46:14.680 --> 00:46:17.900
<v Speaker 2>He likes controlling range and he has an</v>
<v Speaker 2>open hand out,</v>

1035
00:46:18.080 --> 00:46:20.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to try to set that range and to,</v>

1036
00:46:21.070 --> 00:46:25.390
<v Speaker 2>and responsively counter attack and just</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you said,</v>

1037
00:46:25.391 --> 00:46:26.470
<v Speaker 2>guys just run into it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1038
00:46:26.471 --> 00:46:31.471
<v Speaker 2>he's not trying to poke him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's his fault because his hands </v>

1039
00:46:31.471 --> 00:46:31.510
<v Speaker 2>open and his fingers are freaking </v>
<v Speaker 2>pointing up there.</v>

1040
00:46:31.630 --> 00:46:36.630
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he's doing an </v>

1041
00:46:36.630 --> 00:46:36.630
<v Speaker 2>intentionally either,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it is an issue.</v>

1042
00:46:36.630 --> 00:46:36.630
<v Speaker 2>Has to change.</v>

1043
00:46:36.630 --> 00:46:37.100
<v Speaker 1>It happened with Gustafson and half,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one glover,</v>

1044
00:46:37.160 --> 00:46:38.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's um,</v>

1045
00:46:38.510 --> 00:46:43.510
<v Speaker 1>it's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a very tricky situation because on </v>

1046
00:46:43.510 --> 00:46:46.631
<v Speaker 1>one hand it's a good tactic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a good tactic to try to palm the </v>

1047
00:46:46.631 --> 00:46:46.880
<v Speaker 1>forehead and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1048
00:46:46.881 --> 00:46:48.820
<v Speaker 1>it's a big one in Moitai,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but tie,</v>

1049
00:46:48.910 --> 00:46:50.990
<v Speaker 1>of course you're dealing with a fully </v>
<v Speaker 1>enclosed glove.</v>

1050
00:46:51.950 --> 00:46:56.950
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the fuck they can do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they really need to do something </v>

1051
00:46:56.950 --> 00:46:56.950
<v Speaker 1>and it needs to be a priority.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gloves,</v>

1052
00:46:56.950 --> 00:46:57.530
<v Speaker 1>Prague,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gloves.</v>

1053
00:46:57.710 --> 00:46:59.000
<v Speaker 1>There it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1054
00:46:59.140 --> 00:47:04.140
<v Speaker 1>when you watch pride.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I've been watching a lot of pride </v>

1055
00:47:04.140 --> 00:47:04.140
<v Speaker 1>lately because I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1056
00:47:04.140 --> 00:47:04.140
<v Speaker 1>at home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1057
00:47:04.140 --> 00:47:04.290
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1058
00:47:04.530 --> 00:47:05.430
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fucking awesome.</v>

1059
00:47:06.110 --> 00:47:07.370
<v Speaker 1>Greatest Shit ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1060
00:47:07.371 --> 00:47:10.130
<v Speaker 1>it's really interesting to watch the </v>
<v Speaker 1>evolution of the sport too.</v>

1061
00:47:10.131 --> 00:47:15.131
<v Speaker 1>When you watch pride,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you watched like guys and you compare </v>

1062
00:47:15.131 --> 00:47:15.131
<v Speaker 1>them to the best guys of today and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

1063
00:47:15.131 --> 00:47:17.000
<v Speaker 1>this is like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's been a big fucking jumped,</v>

1064
00:47:17.550 --> 00:47:20.350
<v Speaker 2>big fucking jump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love Don Frye and his mustache.</v>

1065
00:47:20.550 --> 00:47:21.880
<v Speaker 2>Rest in peace,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mustache.</v>

1066
00:47:22.380 --> 00:47:25.030
<v Speaker 2>But you look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's crazy.</v>

1067
00:47:25.031 --> 00:47:30.031
<v Speaker 2>But like Don fry in pride compared to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the light heavyweights,</v>

1068
00:47:30.161 --> 00:47:34.540
<v Speaker 2>now I'm just the disparity of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of skill and technical level.</v>

1069
00:47:34.570 --> 00:47:37.840
<v Speaker 2>Even athleticism and don was a beast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1070
00:47:38.290 --> 00:47:39.160
<v Speaker 2>it's night and day.</v>

1071
00:47:39.500 --> 00:47:44.500
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was watching vandelay the best of </v>

1072
00:47:44.500 --> 00:47:47.610
<v Speaker 1>vandelay in pride.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was an episode in the best of </v>

1073
00:47:47.610 --> 00:47:48.170
<v Speaker 1>pride where it was all vandalized fights</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

1074
00:47:48.270 --> 00:47:49.880
<v Speaker 1>vandelays one of my favorite fighters to</v>
<v Speaker 1>watch.</v>

1075
00:47:49.881 --> 00:47:51.390
<v Speaker 1>It's a wild man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

1076
00:47:51.430 --> 00:47:56.430
<v Speaker 1>you compare his skill level to like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy like Jon Jones who they're fighting </v>

1077
00:47:56.430 --> 00:48:00.101
<v Speaker 1>at the same weight class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that wouldn't even be a hard fight </v>

1078
00:48:00.101 --> 00:48:00.101
<v Speaker 1>for like a round.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1079
00:48:00.101 --> 00:48:04.910
<v Speaker 1>It would not be a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would be you can't touch me and I'm </v>

1080
00:48:04.910 --> 00:48:07.871
<v Speaker 1>going to keep hitting you and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to not know what to do and then </v>

1081
00:48:07.871 --> 00:48:07.970
<v Speaker 1>either you're going to get choked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unconscious or,</v>

1082
00:48:08.060 --> 00:48:09.680
<v Speaker 1>or beat the fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1083
00:48:10.160 --> 00:48:15.160
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing how much of a jump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's bins from 93 to 2014 as far as </v>

1084
00:48:15.351 --> 00:48:20.351
<v Speaker 1>the evolution of martial arts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I say it like it's a line that I </v>

1085
00:48:20.351 --> 00:48:22.430
<v Speaker 1>keep saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's true in those two decades,</v>

1086
00:48:22.610 --> 00:48:26.060
<v Speaker 1>martial arts have evolved more than they</v>
<v Speaker 1>have in the last 2000 years.</v>

1087
00:48:26.300 --> 00:48:27.380
<v Speaker 1>It's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

1088
00:48:27.800 --> 00:48:29.090
<v Speaker 1>To longest time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1089
00:48:29.120 --> 00:48:34.120
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I grew up doing martial arts in the </v>

1090
00:48:34.120 --> 00:48:34.120
<v Speaker 1>eighties and nobody knew what the fuck </v>
<v Speaker 1>worked.</v>

1091
00:48:34.120 --> 00:48:36.020
<v Speaker 1>It was all just guessing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1092
00:48:36.021 --> 00:48:37.760
<v Speaker 1>everybody knew that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1093
00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:43.000
<v Speaker 1>if you were a really good wrestler,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could take guys down and if you are </v>

1094
00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:43.520
<v Speaker 1>really good box so you could probably </v>
<v Speaker 1>punch better,</v>

1095
00:48:43.850 --> 00:48:47.240
<v Speaker 1>but what would work better?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Karate or judo,</v>

1096
00:48:47.241 --> 00:48:49.400
<v Speaker 1>what will work better?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jiu Jitsu it nobody knew.</v>

1097
00:48:49.490 --> 00:48:51.610
<v Speaker 1>Nobody fucking knew.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a guessing game.</v>

1098
00:48:51.690 --> 00:48:53.620
<v Speaker 2>Naming new moves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every single card.</v>

1099
00:48:53.630 --> 00:48:53.910
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1100
00:48:53.911 --> 00:48:54.690
<v Speaker 2>what are you gonna?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Call this one.</v>

1101
00:48:54.691 --> 00:48:58.440
<v Speaker 2>Like how can we progress so quickly </v>
<v Speaker 2>where every Saturday night we're like,</v>

1102
00:48:58.500 --> 00:48:59.700
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's a new submission.</v>

1103
00:49:00.100 --> 00:49:01.590
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just unbelievable.</v>

1104
00:49:01.660 --> 00:49:03.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Peruvian Necktie,</v>

1105
00:49:04.120 --> 00:49:06.010
<v Speaker 1>Tony D'souza,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you very rarely see.</v>

1106
00:49:06.011 --> 00:49:07.780
<v Speaker 1>I mean CB dollar is probably the only I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think.</v>

1107
00:49:08.200 --> 00:49:10.870
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know if the Sousas ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>pulled it off inside the octagon,</v>

1108
00:49:10.871 --> 00:49:15.871
<v Speaker 1>but cb Dahl always pulled it off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a few guys that use that Peruvian </v>

1109
00:49:15.871 --> 00:49:17.410
<v Speaker 1>neck time and then there's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

1110
00:49:17.460 --> 00:49:20.010
<v Speaker 1>there's a few jokes that you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1111
00:49:20.011 --> 00:49:22.420
<v Speaker 1>you see them once and then you never see</v>
<v Speaker 1>them again.</v>

1112
00:49:22.610 --> 00:49:27.610
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a fascinating thing where you're </v>

1113
00:49:27.610 --> 00:49:27.610
<v Speaker 1>watching all this stuff evolve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1114
00:49:27.610 --> 00:49:28.000
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In front of your eyes.</v>

1115
00:49:28.480 --> 00:49:33.480
<v Speaker 1>How do you manage your training when it </v>
<v Speaker 1>comes to like working on new techniques,</v>

1116
00:49:33.670 --> 00:49:37.750
<v Speaker 1>adding new things to your arsenal and </v>
<v Speaker 1>instill just the conditioning,</v>

1117
00:49:37.751 --> 00:49:41.170
<v Speaker 1>the sparring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the day to day drilling that you have to</v>

1118
00:49:41.171 --> 00:49:42.890
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how do you manage stuffing,</v>

1119
00:49:42.910 --> 00:49:43.780
<v Speaker 1>all that stuff in</v>

1120
00:49:45.200 --> 00:49:47.360
<v Speaker 2>time management.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like a good athlete,</v>

1121
00:49:47.361 --> 00:49:49.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do things like ratios,</v>

1122
00:49:49.821 --> 00:49:54.821
<v Speaker 2>percentages of k I want to develop or </v>
<v Speaker 2>give a certain percentage of time to </v>

1123
00:49:55.580 --> 00:49:57.980
<v Speaker 2>getting better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm going to,</v>

1124
00:49:58.280 --> 00:50:03.280
<v Speaker 2>let's say I have 10 classes a week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just real easy round number in that </v>

1125
00:50:03.840 --> 00:50:08.840
<v Speaker 2>in those 10 classes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know like I want two or three of </v>

1126
00:50:08.840 --> 00:50:11.120
<v Speaker 2>them to be exclusively focused on </v>
<v Speaker 2>drilling new techniques,</v>

1127
00:50:11.530 --> 00:50:16.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I want two or three of them to be </v>

1128
00:50:16.530 --> 00:50:18.620
<v Speaker 2>maintenance of things that I do well and</v>
<v Speaker 2>want to continue to do well.</v>

1129
00:50:19.040 --> 00:50:20.460
<v Speaker 2>And there's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just grappling like in,</v>

1130
00:50:20.470 --> 00:50:21.020
<v Speaker 2>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a,</v>

1131
00:50:21.021 --> 00:50:24.470
<v Speaker 2>in a one week,</v>
<v Speaker 2>10 class setting and then you know,</v>

1132
00:50:24.680 --> 00:50:26.810
<v Speaker 2>two or three of them are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are hard grappling,</v>

1133
00:50:27.230 --> 00:50:29.010
<v Speaker 2>sparring type sessions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

1134
00:50:29.030 --> 00:50:34.030
<v Speaker 2>Then the other ones like maybe a float </v>
<v Speaker 2>or of I'm teaching or I'm working with </v>

1135
00:50:34.030 --> 00:50:36.740
<v Speaker 2>just a handful of black belts trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>create new stuff,</v>

1136
00:50:37.160 --> 00:50:42.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so like it's equally proportionate to </v>

1137
00:50:42.160 --> 00:50:42.160
<v Speaker 2>stain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>

1138
00:50:42.620 --> 00:50:46.610
<v Speaker 2>Challenging myself physically and </v>
<v Speaker 2>developing new technique and learning.</v>

1139
00:50:46.760 --> 00:50:47.090
<v Speaker 2>You know.</v>

1140
00:50:47.440 --> 00:50:49.510
<v Speaker 3>What about recovery?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what about um,</v>

1141
00:50:49.540 --> 00:50:54.010
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you do stuff for the birds?</v>

1142
00:50:54.040 --> 00:50:59.040
<v Speaker 3>What do you do for fun?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you have like a routine as far as </v>

1143
00:50:59.040 --> 00:51:00.060
<v Speaker 3>like deep tissue massage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cryo therapy?</v>

1144
00:51:00.490 --> 00:51:01.720
<v Speaker 3>What do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1145
00:51:01.721 --> 00:51:03.520
<v Speaker 3>To both of those.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So Austin,</v>

1146
00:51:03.521 --> 00:51:08.521
<v Speaker 3>cryotherapy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm there because I'm one of those </v>

1147
00:51:08.521 --> 00:51:10.471
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You stand in one of those chambers and </v>

1148
00:51:10.471 --> 00:51:12.021
<v Speaker 3>it's 50 below zero.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Negative 300 is that happens your Dick.</v>

1149
00:51:12.311 --> 00:51:15.040
<v Speaker 3>When you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that seems to me it'd be gloved fingers.</v>

1150
00:51:15.041 --> 00:51:15.270
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1151
00:51:15.400 --> 00:51:20.400
<v Speaker 2>And I take those gloved fingers and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>cover what is going to be my very small </v>

1152
00:51:20.400 --> 00:51:21.550
<v Speaker 2>penis in like seconds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1153
00:51:21.700 --> 00:51:24.840

<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

1157
00:51:31.371 --> 00:51:33.300

<v Speaker 3>Wouldn't you know,</v>

1158
00:51:33.600 --> 00:51:35.690
<v Speaker 3>I would assume that you would be one of </v>
<v Speaker 3>those guys.</v>

1159
00:51:35.691 --> 00:51:36.620
<v Speaker 3>I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

1160
00:51:36.880 --> 00:51:39.130
<v Speaker 3>I am that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1161
00:51:39.400 --> 00:51:41.030

<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you messing with me?</v>

1163
00:51:43.210 --> 00:51:44.500
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1164
00:51:44.570 --> 00:51:46.400
<v Speaker 3>just do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A monk position.</v>

1165
00:51:49.730 --> 00:51:50.830
<v Speaker 2>Three minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1166
00:51:51.010 --> 00:51:56.010
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you get out huge infusion of </v>

1167
00:51:56.010 --> 00:51:56.010
<v Speaker 2>blood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You feel better.</v>

1168
00:51:56.010 --> 00:51:56.780
<v Speaker 3>What's the pro?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eddie Bravo did this,</v>

1169
00:51:56.781 --> 00:51:58.400
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in preparation for his heuler match,</v>

1170
00:51:58.401 --> 00:51:59.760
<v Speaker 3>which is the first time I'd heard about </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

1171
00:51:59.810 --> 00:52:02.600
<v Speaker 3>Like explain it to me and for the lay </v>
<v Speaker 3>people at home,</v>

1172
00:52:02.870 --> 00:52:06.440
<v Speaker 3>it's your neck is above your head of </v>
<v Speaker 3>exposed.</v>

1173
00:52:06.460 --> 00:52:08.940
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the closes on you suntanning</v>

1174
00:52:09.080 --> 00:52:09.950
<v Speaker 2>bed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

1175
00:52:09.951 --> 00:52:11.090
<v Speaker 2>But you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're standing up,</v>

1176
00:52:11.280 --> 00:52:12.650
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They punched,</v>

1177
00:52:12.860 --> 00:52:17.860
<v Speaker 2>punched liquid nitrogen gas in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So up I about your chin down to like </v>

1178
00:52:17.860 --> 00:52:19.550
<v Speaker 2>negative 300 degrees.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're breathing,</v>

1179
00:52:19.551 --> 00:52:21.860
<v Speaker 2>the gas is coming up to your Chin and </v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1180
00:52:21.920 --> 00:52:26.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the largest organ in your body is your </v>

1181
00:52:26.920 --> 00:52:26.920
<v Speaker 2>skin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's very responsive.</v>

1182
00:52:26.920 --> 00:52:29.030
<v Speaker 2>It can absorb quickly and people take </v>
<v Speaker 2>drugs that way.</v>

1183
00:52:29.120 --> 00:52:29.810
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1184
00:52:29.811 --> 00:52:33.170
<v Speaker 2>you can also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very responsive,</v>

1185
00:52:33.530 --> 00:52:36.560
<v Speaker 2>so it gets exposed to negative 300 </v>
<v Speaker 2>degrees.</v>

1186
00:52:36.740 --> 00:52:41.740
<v Speaker 2>The first thing it does is take blood </v>
<v Speaker 2>from the extremities and rushes it to </v>

1187
00:52:41.740 --> 00:52:43.640
<v Speaker 2>the vital life sustaining organs of your</v>
<v Speaker 2>body,</v>

1188
00:52:43.641 --> 00:52:44.420
<v Speaker 2>your brain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your heart,</v>

1189
00:52:44.421 --> 00:52:49.421
<v Speaker 2>and your lungs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So all the blood goes from your </v>

1190
00:52:49.421 --> 00:52:50.750
<v Speaker 2>extremities to your core and then you </v>
<v Speaker 2>get in.</v>

1191
00:52:50.751 --> 00:52:53.210
<v Speaker 2>You're there for like two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three minutes and super crazy because if</v>

1192
00:52:53.211 --> 00:52:58.211
<v Speaker 2>you have an injury like a hurt knee or a</v>
<v Speaker 2>hurt hand where you have extra fluid </v>

1193
00:52:58.400 --> 00:53:03.400
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it gets super cold there because you </v>

1194
00:53:03.400 --> 00:53:04.550
<v Speaker 2>have more fluid there and more fluid is </v>
<v Speaker 2>conductive and it gets colder faster.</v>

1195
00:53:04.790 --> 00:53:06.800
<v Speaker 2>So you can feel these injuries on your </v>
<v Speaker 2>body.</v>

1196
00:53:06.801 --> 00:53:10.280
<v Speaker 2>Get crazy cold and then you hop out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Three minutes is up,</v>

1197
00:53:10.281 --> 00:53:15.281
<v Speaker 2>you get out of the get out of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>chamber and then your body responds to </v>

1198
00:53:15.281 --> 00:53:19.811
<v Speaker 2>being an 80 degrees and all the Rut,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the blood rushes back out to the </v>

1199
00:53:19.811 --> 00:53:23.801
<v Speaker 2>extremities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you get this huge infusion of good </v>

1200
00:53:23.801 --> 00:53:26.040
<v Speaker 2>healthy blood back out to these injuries</v>
<v Speaker 2>and out to your extremities.</v>

1201
00:53:26.130 --> 00:53:31.130
<v Speaker 2>It's a rush.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Feels like you just drank five cups of </v>

1202
00:53:31.130 --> 00:53:31.130
<v Speaker 2>coffee and you're like Hampton,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1203
00:53:31.130 --> 00:53:33.780
<v Speaker 2>it's just this weird tingley fantastic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1204
00:53:33.781 --> 00:53:36.150
<v Speaker 2>sensation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's what happens.</v>

1205
00:53:36.151 --> 00:53:40.680
<v Speaker 2>And how does it help you recover by </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing the infusion circulation like the,</v>

1206
00:53:41.010 --> 00:53:45.360
<v Speaker 2>in the trying to treat an injury,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1207
00:53:45.361 --> 00:53:46.200
<v Speaker 2>you have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have rest,</v>

1208
00:53:46.201 --> 00:53:46.770
<v Speaker 2>ice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>compression,</v>

1209
00:53:46.771 --> 00:53:47.880
<v Speaker 2>elevation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1210
00:53:47.881 --> 00:53:52.881
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're trying to work on recovery </v>

1211
00:53:52.881 --> 00:53:55.280
<v Speaker 2>without injury,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want circulation so you want good </v>

1212
00:53:55.280 --> 00:53:58.551
<v Speaker 2>healthy blood going to muscles that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you've just fatigued to increase </v>

1213
00:53:58.551 --> 00:53:58.890
<v Speaker 2>recovery and response time.</v>

1214
00:53:59.430 --> 00:54:04.430
<v Speaker 2>So if you just like simple terms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I went and did like a big squat and </v>

1215
00:54:04.651 --> 00:54:06.360
<v Speaker 2>deadlift workout for the day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1216
00:54:06.361 --> 00:54:08.760
<v Speaker 2>My legs and back and are going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>sore,</v>

1217
00:54:10.010 --> 00:54:12.120
<v Speaker 2>you know those extremities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>law,</v>

1218
00:54:12.150 --> 00:54:15.540
<v Speaker 2>it's vascular region.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So go hop in the cryo chamber.</v>

1219
00:54:16.050 --> 00:54:19.050
<v Speaker 2>All the blood that's sitting there in </v>
<v Speaker 2>that area,</v>

1220
00:54:19.290 --> 00:54:20.880
<v Speaker 2>in my legs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my back and my butt.</v>

1221
00:54:21.230 --> 00:54:24.060
<v Speaker 2>I'm all rushed to my brain and lungs and</v>
<v Speaker 2>heart.</v>

1222
00:54:24.670 --> 00:54:27.540
<v Speaker 2>Then I get out and all sorts of great </v>

<v Speaker 2>out to my extremities to increase </v>
<v Speaker 2>recovery time because I'm just </v>

1226
00:54:38.991 --> 00:54:41.811
<v Speaker 2>increasing circulation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Increasing circulation is increasing </v>

1227
00:54:41.811 --> 00:54:41.811
<v Speaker 2>recovery.</v>

<v Speaker 3>What do you,</v>

1270
00:56:10.751 --> 00:56:15.751
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you do have a nutritionist that you </v>

1271
00:56:15.751 --> 00:56:15.751
<v Speaker 3>work with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you do it on your own,</v>

1272
00:56:15.751 --> 00:56:16.280
<v Speaker 2>of all of the above,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1273
00:56:16.281 --> 00:56:17.420
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1274
00:56:17.750 --> 00:56:22.750
<v Speaker 2>I have nutritionists that I bounce stuff</v>
<v Speaker 2>off of and like people that are way </v>

1275
00:56:22.750 --> 00:56:23.780
<v Speaker 2>smarter than me that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1276
00:56:23.790 --> 00:56:28.150
<v Speaker 2>and then I'm surrounded with so many </v>
<v Speaker 2>other elite athletes talking to them and</v>

1277
00:56:28.151 --> 00:56:29.500
<v Speaker 2>their coaches,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1278
00:56:29.501 --> 00:56:30.610
<v Speaker 2>the guys on it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1279
00:56:30.611 --> 00:56:35.611
<v Speaker 2>they have a whole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have a stable of guys there that </v>

1280
00:56:35.611 --> 00:56:37.090
<v Speaker 2>are always looking for the next best </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing or even not the next best thing.</v>

1281
00:56:37.091 --> 00:56:42.091
<v Speaker 2>Things there just have been there around</v>
<v Speaker 2>for thousands of years that nobody uses </v>

1282
00:56:42.091 --> 00:56:42.091
<v Speaker 2>like they should.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>

1283
00:56:42.091 --> 00:56:44.260
<v Speaker 2>it's a constant discussion of like how </v>
<v Speaker 2>to improve.</v>

1284
00:56:44.261 --> 00:56:47.230
<v Speaker 2>I know what my calories that I'm burning</v>
<v Speaker 2>a day because I log everything.</v>

1285
00:56:47.640 --> 00:56:48.130
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1286
00:56:48.131 --> 00:56:53.131
<v Speaker 2>I fought two weeks ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I was on crazy strict diet for like </v>

1287
00:56:53.131 --> 00:56:54.400
<v Speaker 2>three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>four months to get down to one 85.</v>

1288
00:56:54.950 --> 00:56:56.140
<v Speaker 2>Now I'm back in Austin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Texas.</v>

1289
00:56:56.141 --> 00:56:58.380
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I'll have a little bit of brisket.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's getting in there.</v>

1290
00:56:59.780 --> 00:57:02.580
<v Speaker 2>You has some tacos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what,</v>

1291
00:57:02.630 --> 00:57:04.120
<v Speaker 2>which I think is actually needed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1292
00:57:04.121 --> 00:57:05.340
<v Speaker 2>you should,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1293
00:57:05.341 --> 00:57:07.990
<v Speaker 2>you can't be perfect all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your body needs those cheats.</v>

1294
00:57:08.310 --> 00:57:09.000
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>

1295
00:57:09.001 --> 00:57:14.001
<v Speaker 3>I think cheat days are important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think people that are just completely </v>

1296
00:57:14.001 --> 00:57:16.701
<v Speaker 3>clean and strict,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're robbing yourself also of </v>

1297
00:57:16.701 --> 00:57:16.701
<v Speaker 3>enjoyment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1298
00:57:16.701 --> 00:57:20.690
<v Speaker 3>Life's too short and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's some delicious food that you </v>

1299
00:57:20.690 --> 00:57:21.570
<v Speaker 3>shouldn't eat all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you should eat sometimes.</v>

1300
00:57:22.110 --> 00:57:23.040
<v Speaker 3>Definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1301
00:57:23.190 --> 00:57:24.110
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1302
00:57:24.240 --> 00:57:29.240
<v Speaker 3>so do you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you say that you logged the amount </v>

1303
00:57:29.240 --> 00:57:29.520
<v Speaker 3>of calories that you burn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do you calculate that?</v>

1304
00:57:30.080 --> 00:57:35.080
<v Speaker 2>So heart rate monitor right during the </v>
<v Speaker 2>workout knows my resting metabolic rate </v>

1305
00:57:35.100 --> 00:57:40.100
<v Speaker 2>is key.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to know what that is and once </v>

1306
00:57:40.100 --> 00:57:40.100
<v Speaker 2>you know what that is kind of in between</v>
<v Speaker 2>workouts,</v>

1307
00:57:40.100 --> 00:57:44.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cumulatively in a day what you've burnt </v>

1308
00:57:44.200 --> 00:57:45.890
<v Speaker 2>and then you just add during the </v>
<v Speaker 2>workouts.</v>

1309
00:57:46.020 --> 00:57:51.020
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I work out two or three times that </v>

1310
00:57:51.020 --> 00:57:51.020
<v Speaker 2>day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1311
00:57:51.020 --> 00:57:51.020
<v Speaker 2>if I'm doing a 90 minute strength and </v>
<v Speaker 2>conditioning session,</v>

1312
00:57:51.020 --> 00:57:55.911
<v Speaker 2>you know I'm going to burn anywhere </v>
<v Speaker 2>between 12 to 1600 calories in that </v>

1313
00:57:55.911 --> 00:57:56.210
<v Speaker 2>session.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1314
00:57:56.211 --> 00:57:57.890
<v Speaker 2>from warm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>warm up to cool down.</v>

1315
00:57:58.420 --> 00:58:02.870
<v Speaker 2>And then like last night I had a two </v>
<v Speaker 2>hour Jujitsu Shush session,</v>

1316
00:58:02.871 --> 00:58:03.350
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1317
00:58:03.710 --> 00:58:05.490
<v Speaker 2>and it smashed afterwards,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1318
00:58:05.491 --> 00:58:07.520
<v Speaker 2>like I know what my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of,</v>

1319
00:58:07.521 --> 00:58:11.510
<v Speaker 2>what my heart rate was at during the </v>
<v Speaker 2>entire time and two hours,</v>

1320
00:58:11.540 --> 00:58:13.970
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's going to be another 1500 calories</v>

1321
00:58:13.971 --> 00:58:16.250
<v Speaker 2>that I'm putting on top of what I </v>
<v Speaker 2>brought in that day.</v>

1322
00:58:16.251 --> 00:58:17.930
<v Speaker 2>So I guess snapshot that I bought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1323
00:58:18.260 --> 00:58:19.520
<v Speaker 2>5,500</v>
<v Speaker 2>to 6,000</v>

1324
00:58:19.521 --> 00:58:20.030
<v Speaker 2>calories.</v>

1325
00:58:20.250 --> 00:58:21.540
<v Speaker 3>That's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1326
00:58:21.660 --> 00:58:23.430
<v Speaker 3>That's way more than most people eat the</v>
<v Speaker 3>day.</v>

1327
00:58:23.820 --> 00:58:25.680
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fun to eat that though.</v>

1328
00:58:26.740 --> 00:58:29.050
<v Speaker 3>How do you stuff that in though?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm in the way.</v>

1329
00:58:29.100 --> 00:58:32.850
<v Speaker 3>What do you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Texas brisket.</v>

1330
00:58:33.450 --> 00:58:38.450
<v Speaker 3>So easy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you have any other nutritional </v>

1331
00:58:38.450 --> 00:58:39.510
<v Speaker 3>requirements?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like do you eat gluten?</v>

1332
00:58:39.511 --> 00:58:42.600
<v Speaker 3>Do you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you take sugar into your diet at all?</v>

1333
00:58:42.660 --> 00:58:43.840
<v Speaker 2>I try.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I try not to.</v>

1334
00:58:43.900 --> 00:58:46.210
<v Speaker 2>I'm definitely fight camp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have either of those,</v>

1335
00:58:46.240 --> 00:58:47.350
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like right now,</v>

1336
00:58:47.430 --> 00:58:48.180
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1337
00:58:48.200 --> 00:58:52.180
<v Speaker 2>I had an apple fritter Bagel on Monday.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I hadn't had one of those and</v>

1338
00:58:53.330 --> 00:58:55.160
<v Speaker 3>I didn't even know how long and it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>amazing.</v>

1339
00:58:55.240 --> 00:58:59.030
<v Speaker 3>Is like a small orgasm in my mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know what that is.</v>

1340
00:58:59.031 --> 00:59:00.670
<v Speaker 3>And the Apple Fritter Bagel?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1341
00:59:00.710 --> 00:59:02.060
<v Speaker 3>not Bagel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just an apple fritter.</v>

1342

<v Speaker 3>gluten and sugar and apples.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1354
00:59:32.441 --> 00:59:33.680
<v Speaker 3>Dr Peter Weller invented.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a blood spinning.</v>

1355
00:59:33.750 --> 00:59:36.080
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You guys are doing it too.</v>

1356
00:59:36.480 --> 00:59:37.940
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been getting it done.</v>

1357
00:59:37.941 --> 00:59:38.870
<v Speaker 3>I had it done on my neck.</v>

1358
00:59:39.230 --> 00:59:42.230
<v Speaker 3>I had a bulging disc in my neck that was</v>
<v Speaker 3>impinging on nerves.</v>

1359
00:59:42.231 --> 00:59:44.840
<v Speaker 3>I was getting some numbness in my hand </v>
<v Speaker 3>from Jujitsu.</v>

1360
00:59:45.230 --> 00:59:48.860
<v Speaker 3>Went away and totally the magic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The thing just shrunk down to nothing.</v>

1361
00:59:49.250 --> 00:59:54.250
<v Speaker 3>But the place where I get it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's right down the street from Krispy </v>

1362
00:59:54.250 --> 00:59:54.250
<v Speaker 3>Kreme.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I drive,</v>

1363
00:59:54.250 --> 00:59:56.210
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do I want to fuck up what I just fixed,</v>

1364
00:59:56.211 --> 00:59:58.350
<v Speaker 3>just do it inflammation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

1365
00:59:59.120 --> 01:00:00.480
<v Speaker 3>apparently inflammation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

1366
01:00:00.740 --> 01:00:03.810
<v Speaker 3>I found out about it from a physical </v>
<v Speaker 3>therapist that gluten and inflammation,</v>

1367
01:00:03.811 --> 01:00:04.380
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're like,</v>

1368
01:00:04.760 --> 01:00:05.720
<v Speaker 3>people say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1369
01:00:05.721 --> 01:00:07.520
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not really gluten sensitive.</v>

1370
01:00:07.760 --> 01:00:09.330
<v Speaker 3>Most people aren't mean you can eat </v>
<v Speaker 3>gluten,</v>

1371
01:00:09.331 --> 01:00:14.331
<v Speaker 3>he be fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the reality is it does cause some </v>

1372
01:00:14.331 --> 01:00:14.331
<v Speaker 3>inflammation more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eat the morning you get.</v>

1373
01:00:14.331 --> 01:00:19.060
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a fascinating thing that it's a </v>

1374
01:00:19.060 --> 01:00:21.070
<v Speaker 3>normal part of everybody's diet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You wouldn't think that it would have </v>

1375
01:00:21.070 --> 01:00:21.890
<v Speaker 3>that sort of an effect on your joints or</v>
<v Speaker 3>your back or.</v>

1376
01:00:21.890 --> 01:00:23.270
<v Speaker 3>But it really does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1377
01:00:23.300 --> 01:00:24.800
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially if they train,</v>

1378
01:00:24.801 --> 01:00:28.220
<v Speaker 3>like we do like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then now we're just compounding problems</v>

1379
01:00:28.221 --> 01:00:32.480
<v Speaker 3>where we have the enablers to cause </v>
<v Speaker 3>inflammation and then we're diet.</v>

1380
01:00:32.780 --> 01:00:34.880
<v Speaker 3>Giving something that helps cause it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1381
01:00:34.881 --> 01:00:37.100
<v Speaker 3>now things are just compounded and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>exponential.</v>

1382
01:00:37.101 --> 01:00:38.240
<v Speaker 3>And then we actually like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>

1383
01:00:38.390 --> 01:00:40.580
<v Speaker 3>what about dairy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not much at all.</v>

1384
01:00:40.910 --> 01:00:43.600
<v Speaker 3>Some cheeses I just can't live without </v>
<v Speaker 3>your cheeses.</v>

1385
01:00:43.630 --> 01:00:45.290
<v Speaker 3>Your cheese guy mean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

1386
01:00:45.800 --> 01:00:47.060
<v Speaker 3>I'm a food guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If it's good,</v>

1387
01:00:47.061 --> 01:00:47.720
<v Speaker 3>I want it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1388
01:00:47.721 --> 01:00:48.350
<v Speaker 3>you cook,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1389
01:00:48.410 --> 01:00:49.550
<v Speaker 3>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love to cook.</v>

1390
01:00:49.610 --> 01:00:50.270
<v Speaker 3>What kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do,</v>

1391
01:00:50.300 --> 01:00:51.620
<v Speaker 3>what do you cook?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1392
01:00:51.950 --> 01:00:56.950
<v Speaker 3>I love everything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I love cooking like real.</v>

1393
01:00:58.430 --> 01:01:00.140
<v Speaker 3>When I say real,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1394
01:01:00.710 --> 01:01:04.270
<v Speaker 3>it's my food that I shot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's that I cleaned that.</v>

1395
01:01:04.340 --> 01:01:09.340
<v Speaker 3>I froze that I packaged,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I brought in from my greenhouse in </v>

1396
01:01:09.340 --> 01:01:09.680
<v Speaker 3>my backyard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1397
01:01:09.681 --> 01:01:11.210
<v Speaker 3>like my food.</v>

1398
01:01:11.300 --> 01:01:11.900
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

1399
01:01:11.901 --> 01:01:13.000
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I,</v>

1400
01:01:13.190 --> 01:01:18.190
<v Speaker 3>I'm with you a thousand percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love being connected to what I put in </v>

1401
01:01:18.190 --> 01:01:18.190
<v Speaker 3>my body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1402
01:01:18.190 --> 01:01:22.691
<v Speaker 3>There's very few people who have </v>
<v Speaker 3>experienced that haven't said that it's </v>

1403
01:01:22.691 --> 01:01:25.880
<v Speaker 3>something special when you cook an </v>
<v Speaker 3>animal that you actually hunted,</v>

1404
01:01:26.090 --> 01:01:27.500
<v Speaker 3>shot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>butchered,</v>

1405
01:01:27.620 --> 01:01:30.860
<v Speaker 3>cut up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>put in your freezer or eating in camp,</v>

1406
01:01:30.861 --> 01:01:34.070
<v Speaker 3>which is even better when you're eating </v>
<v Speaker 3>it like a couple of hours after it died.</v>

1407
01:01:34.490 --> 01:01:37.530
<v Speaker 3>This is an amazing connection that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1408
01:01:37.550 --> 01:01:40.040
<v Speaker 3>people will poopoo that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it's not important.</v>

1409
01:01:40.041 --> 01:01:40.910
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1410
01:01:40.911 --> 01:01:45.911
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're just using that as an excuse to </v>

1411
01:01:45.911 --> 01:01:45.911
<v Speaker 3>go out and shoot animals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1412
01:01:45.911 --> 01:01:45.911
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I really wish those folks.</v>

1413
01:01:45.911 --> 01:01:50.080
<v Speaker 3>I would really like to take someone who </v>
<v Speaker 3>is his immediate or who's anting hunting</v>

1414
01:01:50.300 --> 01:01:52.580
<v Speaker 3>and just you need to just experience </v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

1415
01:01:52.600 --> 01:01:55.910
<v Speaker 3>Just experienced 100 percent agree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wish every person that ate meat,</v>

1416
01:01:56.270 --> 01:02:01.270
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and ironically a ton of anti hunters </v>

1417
01:02:01.270 --> 01:02:01.930
<v Speaker 3>like eat meat obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1418
01:02:02.060 --> 01:02:03.820
<v Speaker 3>there's no connection to food these </v>
<v Speaker 3>days.</v>

1419
01:02:04.010 --> 01:02:07.730
<v Speaker 3>People just want to go to the grocery </v>
<v Speaker 3>store and pick their stuff off the shelf</v>

1420
01:02:07.760 --> 01:02:10.130
<v Speaker 3>and have no idea how it got there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what was put in there.</v>

1421
01:02:10.970 --> 01:02:15.970
<v Speaker 3>But then they judge me because I hunt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I know exactly where this animal </v>

1422
01:02:16.311 --> 01:02:17.210
<v Speaker 3>came from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1423
01:02:17.211 --> 01:02:18.980
<v Speaker 3>and like I felt sorry for it when I shot</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

1424
01:02:19.100 --> 01:02:20.160
<v Speaker 3>they thought it was beautiful</v>

1425
01:02:20.520 --> 01:02:22.920
<v Speaker 2>and I still do and I'm enjoying every </v>
<v Speaker 2>single bite of it,</v>

1426
01:02:23.250 --> 01:02:28.250
<v Speaker 2>but they.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they're going to sit there and be </v>

1427
01:02:28.250 --> 01:02:28.250
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>aw man,</v>

1428
01:02:28.250 --> 01:02:28.250
<v Speaker 2>that guy hunts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1429
01:02:28.250 --> 01:02:28.900
<v Speaker 2>like I'm a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm an absolute fanatic conservationist,</v>

1430
01:02:29.750 --> 01:02:30.690
<v Speaker 2>but I want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1431
01:02:30.840 --> 01:02:35.840
<v Speaker 2>And I love my food and I love good food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they're all connected and I think </v>

1432
01:02:35.840 --> 01:02:36.300
<v Speaker 2>people should wake up.</v>

1433
01:02:36.800 --> 01:02:40.170
<v Speaker 1>It's also what we were taught kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about earlier is that there's a.</v>

1434
01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:43.530
<v Speaker 1>there's a broad spectrum of things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are going on in this world.</v>

1435
01:02:43.531 --> 01:02:45.840
<v Speaker 1>There is no black and white when it </v>
<v Speaker 1>comes to hunting.</v>

1436
01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:50.470
<v Speaker 1>You can actually love animals and still </v>
<v Speaker 1>shoot them and kill the level in that,</v>

1437
01:02:50.480 --> 01:02:55.480
<v Speaker 1>but it's a crazy thing like people have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They find that like impossibly </v>

1438
01:02:55.480 --> 01:02:59.301
<v Speaker 1>contradictory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not and it's also the other </v>

1439
01:02:59.301 --> 01:03:01.740
<v Speaker 1>thing that people don't want to admit is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that if you do not shoot these animals,</v>

1440
01:03:01.900 --> 01:03:06.900
<v Speaker 1>they are going to continue to fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to continue to procreate </v>

1441
01:03:06.900 --> 01:03:09.981
<v Speaker 1>and then how are you going to control </v>
<v Speaker 1>the population because you have two </v>

1442
01:03:09.981 --> 01:03:13.221
<v Speaker 1>options.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Either you can hunt them or you can </v>

1443
01:03:13.221 --> 01:03:13.221
<v Speaker 1>bring in wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what do you want to do?</v>

1444
01:03:13.221 --> 01:03:14.670
<v Speaker 1>You want wolves wandering around through</v>
<v Speaker 1>your fucking neighborhood,</v>

1445
01:03:14.700 --> 01:03:16.650
<v Speaker 1>killing everything that they can get </v>
<v Speaker 1>ahold of,</v>

1446
01:03:16.651 --> 01:03:19.200
<v Speaker 1>including dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including livestock.</v>

1447
01:03:19.201 --> 01:03:21.660
<v Speaker 1>Do you want wild panthers?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you want?</v>

1448
01:03:21.661 --> 01:03:26.661
<v Speaker 1>What do you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How are you going to control the </v>

1449
01:03:26.661 --> 01:03:27.240
<v Speaker 1>populations of these animals that don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>have natural predators?</v>

1450
01:03:27.390 --> 01:03:29.070
<v Speaker 2>The first,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my experience,</v>

1451
01:03:29.071 --> 01:03:34.071
<v Speaker 2>I was like a prepubescent kid when </v>
<v Speaker 2>Catalina island off the coast of </v>

1452
01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:41.000
<v Speaker 2>California,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm somebody accidentally introduced a </v>

1453
01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:44.520
<v Speaker 2>hog to Catalina and it made it in boned </v>
<v Speaker 2>with maybe one or two other wild hogs </v>

1454
01:03:47.791 --> 01:03:52.791
<v Speaker 2>that were there that created this feral </v>
<v Speaker 2>big ass hog that made a whole bunch of </v>

1455
01:03:52.791 --> 01:03:57.231
<v Speaker 2>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tons of more hogs and then started </v>

1456
01:03:57.231 --> 01:03:59.510
<v Speaker 2>destroying the entire island.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they brought in hunters to x,</v>

1457
01:04:00.280 --> 01:04:02.820
<v Speaker 2>like get rid of these hogs that we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>destroying the,</v>

1458
01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:06.540
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the entire ecosystem of the island.</v>

1459
01:04:07.070 --> 01:04:10.860
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that happens on a much more.</v>

1460
01:04:10.920 --> 01:04:14.010
<v Speaker 2>That's the micro example on a tiny </v>
<v Speaker 2>little island with a tiny little animal.</v>

1461
01:04:14.250 --> 01:04:16.860
<v Speaker 2>But if you look at the big picture of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1462
01:04:16.890 --> 01:04:21.180
<v Speaker 2>like deer in the south or hogs from </v>
<v Speaker 2>Florida to Texas,</v>

1463
01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:23.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or the python that was introduced to the</v>

1464
01:04:23.461 --> 01:04:28.461
<v Speaker 2>everglades,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have to be hunted to maintain the </v>

1465
01:04:28.461 --> 01:04:32.361
<v Speaker 2>balance of harmony in the ecosystem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the ecosystem will crash if it's not</v>

1466
01:04:33.601 --> 01:04:35.130
<v Speaker 2>done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1467
01:04:35.190 --> 01:04:36.570
<v Speaker 2>so you either,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you said,</v>

1468
01:04:36.571 --> 01:04:41.571
<v Speaker 2>give a Predator and the Predator has </v>
<v Speaker 2>serious problems that come along with </v>

1469
01:04:41.571 --> 01:04:45.141
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or You have the hunter that does it </v>

1470
01:04:45.141 --> 01:04:45.870
<v Speaker 2>properly and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you have the benefits that come</v>

1471
01:04:45.871 --> 01:04:47.940
<v Speaker 2>along with it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a proper ecosystem</v>

1472
01:04:48.030 --> 01:04:51.380
<v Speaker 1>and you get delicious wild Ham.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at that.</v>

1473
01:04:51.400 --> 01:04:53.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I smoked that bitch myself.</v>

1474
01:04:53.490 --> 01:04:55.380
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That my backyard,</v>

1475
01:04:55.620 --> 01:04:59.250
<v Speaker 1>I shot it and I smoked it and it was the</v>
<v Speaker 1>best tasting ham ever.</v>

1476
01:04:59.430 --> 01:05:03.150
<v Speaker 1>Wild pig has a completely different </v>
<v Speaker 1>texture than anything.</v>

1477
01:05:03.180 --> 01:05:04.920
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a,</v>

1478
01:05:05.040 --> 01:05:10.040
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I marinated it or brined it rather for </v>

1479
01:05:10.040 --> 01:05:11.340
<v Speaker 1>seven days before I smoked it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But even so it's like,</v>

1480
01:05:11.550 --> 01:05:14.490
<v Speaker 1>it's a more dense meet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's more muscle,</v>

1481
01:05:14.491 --> 01:05:16.290
<v Speaker 1>it's darker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it tastes better.</v>

1482
01:05:16.291 --> 01:05:18.040
<v Speaker 1>It's better for you and</v>

1483
01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:21.220
<v Speaker 3>you fucking have to kill them because </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's 50,000</v>

1484
01:05:21.221 --> 01:05:26.221
<v Speaker 3>hogs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The place where I go to is to hone </v>

1485
01:05:26.221 --> 01:05:26.221
<v Speaker 3>ranch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We only an hour and a half outside of La</v>

1486
01:05:26.230 --> 01:05:31.230
<v Speaker 3>and they have elk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have a pond up there that they put </v>

1487
01:05:31.230 --> 01:05:31.540
<v Speaker 3>a trail camera on just to see what's </v>
<v Speaker 3>eating there.</v>

1488
01:05:31.690 --> 01:05:34.870
<v Speaker 3>16 different mountain minds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1489
01:05:34.871 --> 01:05:37.990
<v Speaker 3>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just 16 different fucking wild murderous</v>

1490
01:05:37.991 --> 01:05:40.390
<v Speaker 3>cats.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's because there's so many pigs,</v>

1491
01:05:40.391 --> 01:05:45.391
<v Speaker 3>there's so much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's so much game up there you could </v>

1492
01:05:45.391 --> 01:05:48.391
<v Speaker 3>in in from Texas to Florida,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could bring in every hunter in the </v>

1493
01:05:48.391 --> 01:05:52.240
<v Speaker 3>nation and have them kill 10 pigs a </v>
<v Speaker 3>piece and it wouldn't even dent.</v>

1494
01:05:52.780 --> 01:05:57.780
<v Speaker 3>What's the population of wild hogs in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the southeast?</v>

1495
01:05:58.030 --> 01:06:01.190
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever seen a pork lips now?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1496
01:06:01.360 --> 01:06:04.960
<v Speaker 3>It sounds like the best movie ever.</v>

<v Speaker 3>it is the craziest fucking thing I've </v>

1508
01:06:49.830 --> 01:06:49.830
<v Speaker 3>ever seen on TV.</v>

<v Speaker 3>that's horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are millions of pigs,</v>

1513
01:06:58.630 --> 01:07:00.580
<v Speaker 3>they don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they know not only that,</v>

1514
01:07:00.610 --> 01:07:03.400
<v Speaker 3>they don't stop fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they breed all year round.</v>

1515
01:07:03.400 --> 01:07:06.700
<v Speaker 3>It's not like deer that have a Rut and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then they'll have a fond.</v>

1516
01:07:06.850 --> 01:07:11.680
<v Speaker 3>Now these are animals that are shitting </v>
<v Speaker 3>out four or five pigs every four or five</v>

1517
01:07:11.681 --> 01:07:13.420
<v Speaker 3>months and they just don't,</v>

<v Speaker 3>And this is a,</v>

1520
01:07:15.671 --> 01:07:19.180
<v Speaker 3>this is the video of them shooting these</v>
<v Speaker 3>things from the sky.</v>

1521
01:07:19.181 --> 01:07:22.780
<v Speaker 3>There's actually companies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the wrong one.</v>

1522
01:07:22.781 --> 01:07:27.490
<v Speaker 3>You see what you're showing is there's a</v>
<v Speaker 3>pig hunting video that was a pig hunting</v>

1523
01:07:27.491 --> 01:07:30.220
<v Speaker 3>promo for the sportsmans channel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this is,</v>

1524
01:07:30.221 --> 01:07:30.820
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

1525
01:07:30.821 --> 01:07:35.821
<v Speaker 3>they had a whole episode and in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>episode that killed 450 pigs in a </v>

1526
01:07:35.821 --> 01:07:37.660
<v Speaker 3>fucking 22 minute episodes with </v>
<v Speaker 3>commercials.</v>

1527
01:07:37.790 --> 01:07:41.590
<v Speaker 3>But that's like a drop in the ocean to </v>
<v Speaker 3>what's there.</v>

1528
01:07:41.620 --> 01:07:44.140
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Literally it is like taking a shot glass</v>

1529
01:07:44.141 --> 01:07:45.940
<v Speaker 3>and tossing the end to the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1530
01:07:45.941 --> 01:07:50.941
<v Speaker 3>it's the most ridiculous thing you've </v>
<v Speaker 3>ever seen in your life and they're just </v>

1531
01:07:50.941 --> 01:07:55.830
<v Speaker 3>catching these pigs running head shots </v>
<v Speaker 3>where they're tomblin while they're </v>

1532
01:07:55.830 --> 01:07:56.950
<v Speaker 3>running and there's something barbaric </v>
<v Speaker 3>and fucked up about it,</v>

1533
01:07:57.520 --> 01:08:00.310
<v Speaker 3>but they're taking that food and they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>feeding hungry people.</v>

1534
01:08:00.311 --> 01:08:02.920
<v Speaker 3>They have hunters for the hungry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they give the wild pork,</v>

1535
01:08:02.921 --> 01:08:07.921
<v Speaker 3>which is excellent meat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They give it to a hungry families and </v>

1536
01:08:07.921 --> 01:08:07.921
<v Speaker 3>it's really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really,</v>

1537
01:08:07.921 --> 01:08:09.760
<v Speaker 3>really delicious food and it's important</v>
<v Speaker 3>to.</v>

1538
01:08:09.761 --> 01:08:12.190
<v Speaker 3>But then there's that thing where people</v>
<v Speaker 3>are like,</v>

1539
01:08:12.220 --> 01:08:13.150
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's fucked up,</v>

1540
01:08:13.151 --> 01:08:14.500
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not really hunting.</v>

1541
01:08:14.501 --> 01:08:15.380
<v Speaker 3>They're shooting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all,</v>

1542
01:08:15.430 --> 01:08:16.340
<v Speaker 3>they're not really hunting.</v>

1543
01:08:16.370 --> 01:08:20.690
<v Speaker 1>They're eradicating these problematic </v>
<v Speaker 1>delicious animals.</v>

1544
01:08:20.691 --> 01:08:21.860
<v Speaker 1>That's the best way to look at it.</v>

1545
01:08:22.090 --> 01:08:27.090
<v Speaker 2>They have to be eradicated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And while it might not be the most </v>

1546
01:08:27.090 --> 01:08:27.090
<v Speaker 2>humane approach to it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1547
01:08:27.090 --> 01:08:28.420
<v Speaker 2>it's an,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a necessary one that has to happen.</v>

1548
01:08:28.630 --> 01:08:29.590
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I dunno,</v>

1549
01:08:29.710 --> 01:08:31.560
<v Speaker 2>like it's a necessary evil a little bit.</v>

1550
01:08:32.340 --> 01:08:32.670
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1551
01:08:32.671 --> 01:08:34.380

1555
01:08:45.900 --> 01:08:48.561
<v Speaker 1>and the town is proposed to give these </v>
<v Speaker 1>deer birth control to somehow or another</v>

1556
01:08:49.620 --> 01:08:54.620
<v Speaker 1>give them food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put food out that has birth control in </v>

<v Speaker 1>which by the way,</v>

1558
01:08:54.620 --> 01:08:57.921
<v Speaker 1>the male deer are going to eat too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you can make bitches out of the male </v>

<v Speaker 1>thousands of dollars and it's a direct </v>

1564
01:09:12.171 --> 01:09:15.591
<v Speaker 1>result of the failure to eradicate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These animals are controller population </v>

<v Speaker 2>The cows will step in their whole break </v>

1591
01:10:40.061 --> 01:10:42.350

1595
01:10:53.621 --> 01:10:53.621
<v Speaker 2>the hole and eat it.</v>

1596
01:10:53.730 --> 01:10:57.180
<v Speaker 1>Very different from tree squirrels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tree squirrels are actually good.</v>

1597
01:10:57.181 --> 01:10:58.890
<v Speaker 1>I've eaten tree squirrel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're delicious.</v>

<v Speaker 1>They're tastes good man.</v>

1599
01:11:01.170 --> 01:11:02.880
<v Speaker 1>Steve Rinella.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The guy who was the host,</v>

1600
01:11:02.881 --> 01:11:07.881
<v Speaker 1>immediate or shadow squirrel when we </v>
<v Speaker 1>were in Wisconsin and cooked it and it </v>

1601
01:11:07.881 --> 01:11:11.031
<v Speaker 1>was real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very unique taste to it doesn't </v>

1602
01:11:11.031 --> 01:11:11.031
<v Speaker 1>taste like anything else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

1603
01:11:11.180 --> 01:11:12.740
<v Speaker 2>ground squirrels,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1604
01:11:12.920 --> 01:11:14.070
<v Speaker 2>I eat one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1605
01:11:14.290 --> 01:11:16.140
<v Speaker 3>we currently can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Apparently.</v>

1606
01:11:16.141 --> 01:11:17.430
<v Speaker 3>They're just fucking disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1607
01:11:17.790 --> 01:11:18.450
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1608
01:11:18.451 --> 01:11:20.520
<v Speaker 3>I guess you could eat it if you were </v>
<v Speaker 3>starving to death,</v>

1609
01:11:20.521 --> 01:11:22.800
<v Speaker 3>but the other problem is if you shoot </v>
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>

1610
01:11:22.830 --> 01:11:26.100
<v Speaker 3>you have to kill them because if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>shoot them and you wound them,</v>

1611
01:11:26.101 --> 01:11:28.110
<v Speaker 3>they run into their hole and then the </v>
<v Speaker 3>other ones eat it.</v>

1612
01:11:28.170 --> 01:11:31.080
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fucking creepy little nasty.</v>

1613
01:11:31.750 --> 01:11:36.750
<v Speaker 3>A lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of creepy little animals out </v>

1614
01:11:36.750 --> 01:11:36.750
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But this,</v>

1615
01:11:36.750 --> 01:11:39.090
<v Speaker 3>I mean the idea that there's one branch </v>
<v Speaker 3>with $2 million,</v>

1616
01:11:39.091 --> 01:11:40.830
<v Speaker 3>700,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>acres there,</v>

1617
01:11:40.840 --> 01:11:43.770
<v Speaker 3>largest largest animal mass is ground </v>
<v Speaker 3>squirrels.</v>

1618
01:11:44.100 --> 01:11:45.840
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they say that the largest mass of,</v>

1619
01:11:45.900 --> 01:11:50.900
<v Speaker 3>of life on earth moving life is aunts </v>
<v Speaker 3>and that there's more pounds of ants a </v>

1620
01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:55.020
<v Speaker 3>than there are humans,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pounds of humans.</v>

1621
01:11:55.410 --> 01:11:56.210
<v Speaker 3>It's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1622
01:11:56.700 --> 01:11:59.970
<v Speaker 3>And they're like 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>times stronger than we are ratio.</v>

1623
01:12:00.340 --> 01:12:03.090
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They never get mad at us.</v>

1624
01:12:03.980 --> 01:12:05.760
<v Speaker 3>Or are they better not start growing.</v>

1625
01:12:06.050 --> 01:12:11.050
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you go back throughout the history </v>

1626
01:12:11.050 --> 01:12:13.221
<v Speaker 3>and you find some of the animals that </v>
<v Speaker 3>were just really enormous just to a few </v>

1627
01:12:13.221 --> 01:12:17.000
<v Speaker 3>hundred million years ago and if somehow</v>
<v Speaker 3>or another shrunk down to a manageable </v>

1628
01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:17.000
<v Speaker 3>size.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1629
01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:18.450
<v Speaker 3>Like if bees,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if bees of the size of horses,</v>

1630
01:12:19.200 --> 01:12:21.840
<v Speaker 3>we'd have real problems.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love honey.</v>

1631
01:12:22.740 --> 01:12:23.820
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Honey is delicious.</v>

1632
01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:25.350
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>vegans don't eat honey.</v>

1633
01:12:25.890 --> 01:12:27.180
<v Speaker 3>That's a horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's hilarious.</v>

1634
01:12:27.210 --> 01:12:32.210
<v Speaker 3>That's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just show if you ever want to know how </v>

1635
01:12:32.210 --> 01:12:33.030
<v Speaker 3>retarded it being a Vegan is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you won't eat honey.</v>

1636
01:12:33.360 --> 01:12:34.670
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>either retarded.</v>

1637
01:12:35.130 --> 01:12:37.140
<v Speaker 3>The moment that they start with I'm a </v>
<v Speaker 3>Vegan,</v>

1638
01:12:37.280 --> 01:12:39.750
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well they can't help say it.</v>

1639
01:12:39.990 --> 01:12:43.230
<v Speaker 3>It's like they're holding hands.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They run marathons.</v>

1640
01:12:43.410 --> 01:12:48.410
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just like another thing that comes out </v>

1641
01:12:48.410 --> 01:12:48.410
<v Speaker 3>right away is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a marathoner,</v>

1642
01:12:48.410 --> 01:12:49.080
<v Speaker 3>or I'm a Vegan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or I eat Paleo,</v>

1643
01:12:49.110 --> 01:12:52.560
<v Speaker 3>or I'm a crossfit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's like nobody can help but tell you</v>

1644
01:12:52.561 --> 01:12:54.540
<v Speaker 3>those necessary elements of themselves.</v>

1645
01:12:55.940 --> 01:12:56.850
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is that?</v>

1646
01:12:56.910 --> 01:13:01.910
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's they want to tell you they're </v>

1647
01:13:01.910 --> 01:13:03.651
<v Speaker 3>awesome,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but to me that almost discounts </v>

1648
01:13:03.651 --> 01:13:04.700
<v Speaker 3>discounts you as being such.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1649
01:13:04.710 --> 01:13:07.530
<v Speaker 3>If you're a Vegan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you cannot tell people for a long period</v>

1650
01:13:07.531 --> 01:13:09.150
<v Speaker 3>of time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's super impressive.</v>

1651
01:13:09.480 --> 01:13:12.720
<v Speaker 3>I'll like you more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1652
01:13:12.870 --> 01:13:15.150
<v Speaker 3>You're a Vegan and you just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It took you two weeks to tell me,</v>

1653
01:13:15.240 --> 01:13:18.900
<v Speaker 3>I'm impressed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can I buy you lunch of Vegan lunch?</v>

1654
01:13:19.180 --> 01:13:21.450
<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For people that don't want to be cruel,</v>

1655
01:13:21.510 --> 01:13:24.390
<v Speaker 3>I totally get the whole sentiment I get.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get all of it.</v>

1656
01:13:24.391 --> 01:13:29.391
<v Speaker 3>I get the idea of like wanting to eat </v>
<v Speaker 3>fresh vegetables and it's healthy for </v>

1657
01:13:29.391 --> 01:13:29.391
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get it,</v>

1658
01:13:29.391 --> 01:13:32.190
<v Speaker 3>but the finite nature of life itself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just.</v>

1659
01:13:32.220 --> 01:13:37.220
<v Speaker 3>It seems to me it's so silly that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>think that somehow under the EU not </v>

1660
01:13:37.220 --> 01:13:41.211
<v Speaker 3>killing animals is somehow going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>balance things out or you not being a </v>

1661
01:13:41.211 --> 01:13:41.640
<v Speaker 3>part of killing animals is going to bow.</v>

1662
01:13:42.030 --> 01:13:44.040
<v Speaker 3>They're killing each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you know that?</v>

1663
01:13:44.070 --> 01:13:47.400
<v Speaker 3>Like there's a war going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All the animals are involved in it,</v>

1664
01:13:47.401 --> 01:13:49.620
<v Speaker 3>including humans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're just so far ahead.</v>

1665
01:13:49.621 --> 01:13:52.220
<v Speaker 3>We forgot it's a war and we have POW </v>
<v Speaker 3>camps,</v>

1666
01:13:52.221 --> 01:13:55.250
<v Speaker 3>so we set up in cities,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we call them zoos and that's it.</v>

1667
01:13:55.260 --> 01:13:57.540
<v Speaker 3>That is that they didn't ask to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

1668
01:13:57.870 --> 01:14:02.870
<v Speaker 3>We capture those motherfuckers and we </v>
<v Speaker 3>put them and they're in these weird </v>

1669
01:14:02.870 --> 01:14:04.320
<v Speaker 3>things where we don't let them interact </v>
<v Speaker 3>with the other animals in the zoo.</v>

1670
01:14:04.340 --> 01:14:09.340
<v Speaker 3>We,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we blocked them off in their own little </v>

1671
01:14:09.340 --> 01:14:10.100
<v Speaker 3>apartments and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we could stare at him all we popcorn.</v>

1672
01:14:11.380 --> 01:14:13.330
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure I agree with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>

1673
01:14:13.600 --> 01:14:18.600
<v Speaker 3>I think that if you should have zoos,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you should lump all those bitches </v>

1674
01:14:18.600 --> 01:14:19.150
<v Speaker 3>together and if you run out of monkeys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go get more.</v>

1675
01:14:20.880 --> 01:14:24.400
<v Speaker 3>The monkeys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the monkeys that survive are going to be</v>

1676
01:14:24.401 --> 01:14:25.930
<v Speaker 3>the ones that know how to get away from </v>
<v Speaker 3>the cat.</v>

1677
01:14:26.230 --> 01:14:27.760
<v Speaker 3>He's a bad ass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That monkey.</v>

1678
01:14:27.761 --> 01:14:28.720
<v Speaker 3>I want us to pet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1679
01:14:28.721 --> 01:14:30.310
<v Speaker 3>that's a monkey.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Knows that to zig and zag.</v>

1680
01:14:30.311 --> 01:14:32.870
<v Speaker 3>He knows that a Juke,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know when the cat's coming,</v>

1681
01:14:32.871 --> 01:14:34.870
<v Speaker 3>he knows that to gets to the type.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The tall branches,</v>

1682
01:14:35.350 --> 01:14:40.350
<v Speaker 3>the monkey that stays in the ground and </v>
<v Speaker 3>picks his ass while the Jaguars slowly </v>

1683
01:14:40.350 --> 01:14:43.531
<v Speaker 3>creeping up on him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the monkey that's supposed to </v>

1684
01:14:43.531 --> 01:14:45.751
<v Speaker 3>die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The only weird part about the shoe </v>

1685
01:14:45.751 --> 01:14:48.750
<v Speaker 3>worlds and the zoos have this of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of our life is that they do.</v>

1686
01:14:49.130 --> 01:14:50.650
<v Speaker 3>I love when people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1687
01:14:50.651 --> 01:14:52.310
<v Speaker 3>did you see the movie black fish?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1688
01:14:52.320 --> 01:14:53.610
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so horrible.</v>

1689
01:14:53.680 --> 01:14:55.670
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to boycott seaworld.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>

1690
01:14:57.010 --> 01:15:02.010
<v Speaker 3>have you ever given a cent to marine </v>
<v Speaker 3>biology or the preservation of marine </v>

1691
01:15:02.010 --> 01:15:02.740
<v Speaker 3>wildlife?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1692
01:15:02.890 --> 01:15:07.890
<v Speaker 3>but you're going to boycott seaworld.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How much money have they given in the </v>

1693
01:15:07.960 --> 01:15:10.390
<v Speaker 3>research and preservation of marine </v>
<v Speaker 3>wildlife?</v>

1694
01:15:10.510 --> 01:15:11.950
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A thousand times more than you.</v>

1695
01:15:11.951 --> 01:15:13.060
<v Speaker 3>It's the same with the zoos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1696
01:15:13.061 --> 01:15:14.530
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't like zoos.</v>

1697
01:15:14.531 --> 01:15:16.300
<v Speaker 3>I think it's horrible that the animals </v>
<v Speaker 3>were there,</v>

1698
01:15:16.510 --> 01:15:21.510
<v Speaker 3>but they do more in research and </v>
<v Speaker 3>understanding wildlife and the </v>

1699
01:15:21.510 --> 01:15:24.730
<v Speaker 3>preservation of wildlife.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then almost everyone that goes there and</v>

1700
01:15:24.731 --> 01:15:26.500
<v Speaker 3>then or doesn't go there and complained </v>
<v Speaker 3>about it,</v>

1701
01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:28.630
<v Speaker 3>so it's just like this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>

1702
01:15:28.631 --> 01:15:32.440
<v Speaker 3>shades of gray.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My problem with seaworld is very simple.</v>

1703
01:15:32.530 --> 01:15:34.960
<v Speaker 3>Those animals are smart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're very smart.</v>

1704
01:15:34.961 --> 01:15:39.961
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the cerebral cortex of a dolphin's 40 </v>

1705
01:15:39.961 --> 01:15:39.961
<v Speaker 3>percent larger than that of a human </v>
<v Speaker 3>being so beautiful.</v>

1706
01:15:39.961 --> 01:15:43.930
<v Speaker 3>We don't even understand how smart they </v>
<v Speaker 3>are because they can't alter their </v>

1707
01:15:43.930 --> 01:15:44.380
<v Speaker 3>environment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we don't think of them as being smart</v>

1708
01:15:44.650 --> 01:15:45.960
<v Speaker 3>because they can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't have funds.</v>

1709
01:15:45.980 --> 01:15:50.980
<v Speaker 3>They don't pick things up because they </v>
<v Speaker 3>can move in three d all around the </v>

1710
01:15:50.980 --> 01:15:54.331
<v Speaker 3>ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can fucking dive and swim and move </v>

1711
01:15:54.331 --> 01:15:54.331
<v Speaker 3>around and they have these pods.</v>

1712
01:15:54.331 --> 01:15:55.270
<v Speaker 3>They stay together,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have families,</v>

1713
01:15:55.271 --> 01:15:56.860
<v Speaker 3>they have dialects,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have languages.</v>

1714
01:15:57.070 --> 01:15:59.200
<v Speaker 3>There are so intelligent that we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

1715
01:15:59.201 --> 01:16:04.201
<v Speaker 3>we're just now starting to understand </v>
<v Speaker 3>that they have variations in the way </v>

1716
01:16:04.201 --> 01:16:06.610
<v Speaker 3>they speak depending upon what </v>
<v Speaker 3>geographic location they're at.</v>

1717
01:16:06.880 --> 01:16:11.290
<v Speaker 3>They're really fucking smart human type </v>
<v Speaker 3>smart and just because they're different</v>

1718
01:16:11.291 --> 01:16:13.930
<v Speaker 3>from us and they don't build houses </v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't mean they're not smart.</v>

1719
01:16:14.140 --> 01:16:17.740
<v Speaker 3>So to me it's like slavery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like just because you know,</v>

1720
01:16:17.860 --> 01:16:21.040
<v Speaker 3>we have donated so much money into </v>
<v Speaker 3>slavery research,</v>

1721
01:16:21.400 --> 01:16:23.670
<v Speaker 3>but you're still fucking slave owners.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yukon's,</v>

1722
01:16:24.010 --> 01:16:25.870
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the reason why there needs to be slavery</v>

1723
01:16:25.871 --> 01:16:30.871
<v Speaker 3>research.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just think that anything smart </v>

1724
01:16:30.871 --> 01:16:32.680
<v Speaker 3>shouldn't be in captivity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like giraffes,</v>

1725
01:16:32.980 --> 01:16:35.410
<v Speaker 3>they're so stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You go to the zoo and they seem happy as</v>

1726
01:16:35.411 --> 01:16:38.360
<v Speaker 3>fuck there is happy there and they let </v>
<v Speaker 3>babies feed them.</v>

1727
01:16:38.530 --> 01:16:40.610
<v Speaker 3>I have a three year old,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then she holds up lettuce.</v>

1728
01:16:40.660 --> 01:16:42.700
<v Speaker 3>The draft comes and take it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That fucking drafts.</v>

1729
01:16:42.701 --> 01:16:47.701
<v Speaker 3>Not upset at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're so confident that giraffes are </v>

1730
01:16:47.701 --> 01:16:47.701
<v Speaker 3>chill,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they let babies freedom,</v>

1731
01:16:47.900 --> 01:16:48.750
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are there.</v>

1732
01:16:48.800 --> 01:16:50.260
<v Speaker 3>They are so chill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're just happy.</v>

1733
01:16:50.261 --> 01:16:54.130
<v Speaker 3>There's no lions for you to be a giraffe</v>
<v Speaker 3>all day.</v>

1734
01:16:54.220 --> 01:16:59.220
<v Speaker 3>You have a giant target.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your neck is just a huge target or </v>

1735
01:16:59.220 --> 01:16:59.290
<v Speaker 3>beacon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Somebody wants to bite.</v>

1736
01:16:59.740 --> 01:17:04.740
<v Speaker 3>There's not one spot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not like a wart hog that is just a </v>

1737
01:17:04.740 --> 01:17:05.230
<v Speaker 3>little short fucking stubby neck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's tough to get to you.</v>

1738
01:17:05.260 --> 01:17:10.010
<v Speaker 3>There's a giant neck trees everywhere </v>
<v Speaker 3>rounded you could and kill</v>

1739
01:17:10.010 --> 01:17:11.180
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1740
01:17:11.181 --> 01:17:13.010
<v Speaker 1>they're so happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're in the zoo.</v>

1741
01:17:13.100 --> 01:17:13.990
<v Speaker 1>They're so happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1742
01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.280
<v Speaker 1>they don't know how happy they are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

1743
01:17:16.980 --> 01:17:21.980
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing's eating meat and this three </v>

1744
01:17:21.980 --> 01:17:21.980
<v Speaker 1>year olds giving me food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1745
01:17:21.980 --> 01:17:23.780
<v Speaker 1>I think this is good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then there's,</v>

1746
01:17:24.120 --> 01:17:28.100
<v Speaker 1>there's weirdness when it comes to </v>
<v Speaker 1>captivated captive animals,</v>

1747
01:17:28.101 --> 01:17:28.560
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1748
01:17:28.940 --> 01:17:30.890
<v Speaker 1>these hunting camps that they have in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Africa,</v>

1749
01:17:31.530 --> 01:17:34.940
<v Speaker 1>it gets again the gray area,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the weirdness of the world because,</v>

1750
01:17:35.420 --> 01:17:37.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Louis thorough the documentary guy.</v>

1751
01:17:38.080 --> 01:17:40.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fascinating guy had him on the podcast.</v>

1752
01:17:40.251 --> 01:17:41.640
<v Speaker 1>Really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really interesting category to watch.</v>

1753
01:17:41.641 --> 01:17:46.641
<v Speaker 1>That one is a good one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the best documentaries that he </v>

1754
01:17:46.641 --> 01:17:48.020
<v Speaker 1>did was when he went to Africa and went </v>
<v Speaker 1>to these hunting camps,</v>

1755
01:17:48.410 --> 01:17:53.410
<v Speaker 1>they have these high fence hunting camps</v>
<v Speaker 1>where they take these animals and they </v>

1756
01:17:53.410 --> 01:17:54.650
<v Speaker 1>put them in these huge enclosures and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they let people hunt them.</v>

1757
01:17:55.250 --> 01:17:59.690
<v Speaker 1>The irony is these animals are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's higher populations.</v>

1758
01:17:59.690 --> 01:18:01.190
<v Speaker 1>They're healthier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's more of them.</v>

1759
01:18:01.191 --> 01:18:04.100
<v Speaker 1>Animals that were on the verge of </v>
<v Speaker 1>extinction are now.</v>

1760
01:18:04.460 --> 01:18:05.930
<v Speaker 1>There's many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>

1761
01:18:05.931 --> 01:18:08.300
<v Speaker 1>many of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're hunted.</v>

1762
01:18:08.530 --> 01:18:11.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's like people have this weird sort</v>

1763
01:18:11.001 --> 01:18:12.380
<v Speaker 1>of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well yeah,</v>

1764
01:18:12.381 --> 01:18:14.810
<v Speaker 1>the animals are healthier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that populations are healthier,</v>

1765
01:18:14.811 --> 01:18:17.870
<v Speaker 1>but the reason being is because people </v>
<v Speaker 1>can pay to go kill them.</v>

1766
01:18:17.871 --> 01:18:22.871
<v Speaker 1>Like whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's just another example of the </v>

1767
01:18:22.871 --> 01:18:25.970
<v Speaker 1>world not being so clear cut.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of weirdness out there.</v>

1768
01:18:26.930 --> 01:18:31.930
<v Speaker 1>Ironically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the like some of the rhinos that are </v>

1769
01:18:31.930 --> 01:18:33.200
<v Speaker 1>left in this world are at those camps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not being hunted.</v>

1770
01:18:33.470 --> 01:18:37.100
<v Speaker 1>There've been protected during these </v>
<v Speaker 1>high fence game fence areas where people</v>

1771
01:18:37.101 --> 01:18:42.101
<v Speaker 1>are coming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll come look at the rhino and be </v>

1772
01:18:42.101 --> 01:18:42.101
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh wow,</v>

1773
01:18:42.101 --> 01:18:42.101
<v Speaker 1>what a beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Righto,</v>

1774
01:18:42.101 --> 01:18:42.101
<v Speaker 1>righto.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

1775
01:18:42.101 --> 01:18:44.690
<v Speaker 1>let's go shoot a buck and a kudu.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much does it cost?</v>

1776
01:18:44.930 --> 01:18:46.220
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like something they couldn't do 20 years</v>

1777
01:18:46.221 --> 01:18:47.360
<v Speaker 1>ago because there weren't enough of </v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

1778
01:18:47.410 --> 01:18:48.410
<v Speaker 1>but no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1779
01:18:48.440 --> 01:18:49.820
<v Speaker 1>oh limitless and Paula,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

1780
01:18:49.820 --> 01:18:50.690
<v Speaker 1>That's a blessed book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1781
01:18:50.720 --> 01:18:52.310
<v Speaker 1>I'll take one of those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not a problem.</v>

1782
01:18:52.540 --> 01:18:54.170
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that's what it's like there.</v>

1783
01:18:54.200 --> 01:18:59.200
<v Speaker 1>But there they saved species by making </v>
<v Speaker 1>them available to be paid for.</v>

1784
01:19:00.720 --> 01:19:02.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was very strange.</v>

1785
01:19:02.550 --> 01:19:06.080
<v Speaker 1>And Louis Theroux is documentary really </v>
<v Speaker 1>kept his position.</v>

1786
01:19:06.290 --> 01:19:11.290
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his position is he's trying to get to </v>

1787
01:19:11.290 --> 01:19:14.521
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's trying to get to his position </v>

1788
01:19:14.521 --> 01:19:14.521
<v Speaker 1>during the whole documentary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

1789
01:19:14.521 --> 01:19:14.990
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see,</v>

1790
01:19:15.290 --> 01:19:20.290
<v Speaker 1>but the real position is really clearly </v>
<v Speaker 1>established by the guy who runs the </v>

1791
01:19:20.781 --> 01:19:22.430
<v Speaker 1>hunting camp because he gets angry at </v>
<v Speaker 1>Louis.</v>

1792
01:19:22.720 --> 01:19:23.930
<v Speaker 1>One point in the show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1793
01:19:24.090 --> 01:19:25.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three quarters of the way in.</v>

1794
01:19:25.730 --> 01:19:27.290
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't understand.</v>

1795
01:19:27.291 --> 01:19:29.300
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Africa is fucked.</v>

1796
01:19:29.630 --> 01:19:30.680
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fucked.</v>

1797
01:19:30.880 --> 01:19:34.400
<v Speaker 1>Unless something is with money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's gonna fucking die.</v>

1798
01:19:34.520 --> 01:19:36.730
<v Speaker 1>They fucking kill everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fucked.</v>

1799
01:19:36.731 --> 01:19:39.500
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing here that have these </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking animals.</v>

1800
01:19:39.501 --> 01:19:42.560
<v Speaker 1>I here is because they're worth money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

1801
01:19:42.680 --> 01:19:43.940
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you understand?</v>

1802
01:19:44.240 --> 01:19:47.660
<v Speaker 1>And you know Louise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I guess I understand it's true.</v>

1803
01:19:47.720 --> 01:19:49.700
<v Speaker 1>It is true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is true,</v>

1804
01:19:50.260 --> 01:19:55.260
<v Speaker 1>and in a sense that sort of mirrors </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going on when it comes to </v>

1805
01:19:55.281 --> 01:20:00.281
<v Speaker 1>wildlife in America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>More money has been spent by hunters to </v>

1806
01:20:00.281 --> 01:20:03.230
<v Speaker 1>conserve wetlands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to preserve wildlife habitat,</v>

1807
01:20:03.231 --> 01:20:07.240
<v Speaker 1>for elk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to preserve areas where deer live and,</v>

1808
01:20:07.241 --> 01:20:07.890
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to</v>

1809
01:20:08.250 --> 01:20:13.250
<v Speaker 3>establish clear protocols as far as how </v>
<v Speaker 3>many animals can,</v>

1810
01:20:13.920 --> 01:20:18.150
<v Speaker 3>can be sustained in any given location </v>
<v Speaker 3>and keep the populations healthy.</v>

1811
01:20:18.270 --> 01:20:21.330
<v Speaker 3>All that money comes from hunters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is just amazing.</v>

1812
01:20:21.331 --> 01:20:23.220
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's another one of those things.</v>

1813
01:20:23.221 --> 01:20:27.810
<v Speaker 3>It's like when you look at it in a clear</v>
<v Speaker 3>objective terms,</v>

1814
01:20:28.020 --> 01:20:33.020
<v Speaker 3>you see that this is a very complex </v>
<v Speaker 3>issue and it's not as simple as these </v>

1815
01:20:33.020 --> 01:20:34.720
<v Speaker 3>animals are beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We should not kill them.</v>

1816
01:20:34.740 --> 01:20:35.880
<v Speaker 3>Like they're beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1817
01:20:35.881 --> 01:20:37.770
<v Speaker 3>You have to kill them though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you have to kill him.</v>

1818
01:20:37.960 --> 01:20:39.060
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1819
01:20:39.130 --> 01:20:41.670
<v Speaker 3>Sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not really the delicious.</v>

1820
01:20:42.600 --> 01:20:44.360
<v Speaker 3>That's the crazy thing is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1821
01:20:44.370 --> 01:20:45.660
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't really suck.</v>

1822
01:20:45.690 --> 01:20:46.840
<v Speaker 3>They are delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1823
01:20:47.080 --> 01:20:49.530
<v Speaker 3>fuck man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's so much going on there.</v>

1824
01:20:49.560 --> 01:20:54.560
<v Speaker 3>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's just the way the world is the </v>

1825
01:20:54.560 --> 01:20:58.191
<v Speaker 3>world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is like this ironic contrast to </v>

1826
01:20:58.191 --> 01:20:58.191
<v Speaker 3>the first 10 years of my life where </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1827
01:20:58.380 --> 01:21:01.260
<v Speaker 3>I didn't think what I was shooting was </v>
<v Speaker 3>beautiful because they're evil fuckers,</v>

1828
01:21:01.980 --> 01:21:04.370
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like now as a sportsman,</v>

1829
01:21:04.390 --> 01:21:06.450
<v Speaker 3>a hunter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I love these animals.</v>

1830
01:21:06.630 --> 01:21:08.960
<v Speaker 3>Which animals do you think we're evil?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1831
01:21:09.030 --> 01:21:10.790
<v Speaker 3>terrorists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when we are,</v>

1832
01:21:10.930 --> 01:21:12.630
<v Speaker 3>you said for the first 10 years of your </v>
<v Speaker 3>life,</v>

1833
01:21:12.631 --> 01:21:15.990
<v Speaker 3>you're shooting terrorist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ten years of my career as a shooter.</v>

1834
01:21:16.230 --> 01:21:21.230
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought you were saying as your life </v>

1835
01:21:21.230 --> 01:21:23.330
<v Speaker 3>when you're nine years old at 23,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1836
01:21:23.571 --> 01:21:28.571
<v Speaker 3>it's like no remorse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Slept very well at night because these </v>

1837
01:21:28.571 --> 01:21:29.670
<v Speaker 3>were evil people and now I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh man,</v>

1838
01:21:29.671 --> 01:21:31.050
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to shoot that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's pretty.</v>

1839
01:21:31.360 --> 01:21:33.020
<v Speaker 3>Now that thing's beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That all.</v>

1840
01:21:33.021 --> 01:21:33.720
<v Speaker 3>Shoot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1841
01:21:33.850 --> 01:21:36.870
<v Speaker 3>because that is really yummy and there's</v>
<v Speaker 3>too many of them know.</v>

1842
01:21:37.170 --> 01:21:42.170
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a buddy who served and came back </v>

1843
01:21:42.170 --> 01:21:43.950
<v Speaker 3>and he loves fishing and he had a real </v>
<v Speaker 3>hard time getting back into hunting.</v>

1844
01:21:44.400 --> 01:21:45.590
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1845
01:21:45.600 --> 01:21:48.300
<v Speaker 3>you just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you see so much death at a certain point</v>

1846
01:21:48.301 --> 01:21:53.301
<v Speaker 3>in time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't want to be a part of </v>

1847
01:21:53.301 --> 01:21:53.301
<v Speaker 3>empathize.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1848
01:21:53.301 --> 01:21:53.301
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>

1849
01:21:53.301 --> 01:21:56.530
<v Speaker 3>he got back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He lives in New Mexico and he got back </v>

1850
01:21:56.530 --> 01:21:56.530
<v Speaker 3>into elk hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>New Mexican was great for elk.</v>

1851
01:21:56.820 --> 01:21:58.860
<v Speaker 3>He got back into an after awhile,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it took them awhile,</v>

1852
01:21:58.920 --> 01:22:01.560
<v Speaker 3>took them awhile to just sort of settle </v>
<v Speaker 3>in.</v>

1853
01:22:02.020 --> 01:22:03.690
<v Speaker 3>He just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw too much death.</v>

1854
01:22:05.820 --> 01:22:10.820
<v Speaker 3>Totally empathetic to that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is there ever going to be a time when </v>

1855
01:22:10.820 --> 01:22:13.030
<v Speaker 3>there's no war?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that even possible with human beings?</v>

1856
01:22:13.410 --> 01:22:18.410
<v Speaker 3>Not In my lifetime.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a disturbing idea for people </v>

1857
01:22:18.410 --> 01:22:20.700
<v Speaker 3>because if people have this idea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean this is,</v>

1858
01:22:20.730 --> 01:22:24.630
<v Speaker 3>this is a shitty analogy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's one that I use if 20 people can</v>

1859
01:22:24.631 --> 01:22:25.750
<v Speaker 3>get along,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if like,</v>

1860
01:22:25.920 --> 01:22:30.920
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's five of us in this room were </v>

1861
01:22:30.920 --> 01:22:32.750
<v Speaker 3>four of us in this room.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If there's four people in this room and </v>

1862
01:22:32.750 --> 01:22:33.360
<v Speaker 3>we can get along,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can 40 people get along?</v>

1863
01:22:33.570 --> 01:22:34.920
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>40 people can get along.</v>

1864
01:22:34.921 --> 01:22:39.921
<v Speaker 3>You could have a community of 40 people </v>
<v Speaker 3>with no problems and just live from </v>

1865
01:22:39.921 --> 01:22:39.990
<v Speaker 3>birth to death and everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1866
01:22:39.991 --> 01:22:42.630
<v Speaker 3>nobody kills anybody that weird outlier </v>
<v Speaker 3>at 40,</v>

1867
01:22:42.631 --> 01:22:47.631
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a community that they'll absorb him </v>

1868
01:22:47.631 --> 01:22:47.970
<v Speaker 3>for what he is or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then you get to 4,000.</v>

1869
01:22:50.180 --> 01:22:51.000
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1870
01:22:51.090 --> 01:22:52.410
<v Speaker 3>someone's going to die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1871
01:22:52.740 --> 01:22:54.750
<v Speaker 3>Jim's Douche.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've got to take out Jim,</v>

1872
01:22:54.980 --> 01:22:59.980
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and everybody's gonna meet by the </v>

1873
01:22:59.980 --> 01:22:59.980
<v Speaker 3>Campfire and go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

1874
01:22:59.980 --> 01:23:00.000
<v Speaker 3>this motherfucker is just ruining our </v>
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>

1875
01:23:00.010 --> 01:23:01.860
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't hunt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He eats all her food.</v>

1876
01:23:02.040 --> 01:23:05.130
<v Speaker 3>He fucks are women were not there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He beats our kids.</v>

1877
01:23:05.380 --> 01:23:06.040
<v Speaker 3>We've got to kill this</v>

1878
01:23:06.040 --> 01:23:09.370
<v Speaker 1>guy and there's one out of a certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>number.</v>

1879
01:23:09.371 --> 01:23:14.371
<v Speaker 1>There's going to be this one that comes </v>
<v Speaker 1>up and then when you deal with $7 </v>

1880
01:23:14.371 --> 01:23:15.400
<v Speaker 1>million,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

1881
01:23:15.430 --> 01:23:16.750
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how does,</v>

1882
01:23:18.310 --> 01:23:21.430
<v Speaker 1>how does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how does that ever become manageable?</v>

1883
01:23:21.431 --> 01:23:25.150
<v Speaker 1>I mean to human beings have to evolve </v>
<v Speaker 1>past what we are right now.</v>

1884
01:23:25.151 --> 01:23:28.630
<v Speaker 1>Do we have to hope some new stage?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1885
01:23:28.631 --> 01:23:31.400
<v Speaker 1>I hope so too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1886
01:23:31.401 --> 01:23:35.300
<v Speaker 1>you would know better than anybody what </v>
<v Speaker 1>the horrors of war are.</v>

1887
01:23:35.450 --> 01:23:40.450
<v Speaker 1>So would you think that someone who has </v>
<v Speaker 1>experienced that would have a better </v>

1888
01:23:40.450 --> 01:23:45.251
<v Speaker 1>perspective about what's necessary and </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's not necessary when it comes to </v>

1889
01:23:46.760 --> 01:23:49.610
<v Speaker 1>sort of just managing piece?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Try to.</v>

1890
01:23:50.990 --> 01:23:52.220
<v Speaker 2>Yes and no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1891
01:23:52.221 --> 01:23:57.221
<v Speaker 2>there's no like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nirvana moment where you had like this </v>

1892
01:23:57.221 --> 01:23:57.221
<v Speaker 2>clear sight of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1893
01:23:57.230 --> 01:24:00.950
<v Speaker 2>what an understanding of what's </v>
<v Speaker 2>necessary and what's not,</v>

1894
01:24:00.951 --> 01:24:02.900
<v Speaker 2>how people should be or how people </v>
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't be.</v>

1895
01:24:03.440 --> 01:24:05.780
<v Speaker 2>Like if anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1896
01:24:06.260 --> 01:24:11.260
<v Speaker 2>as six years as a door kicker assaulter </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then four years as a halo sniper </v>

1897
01:24:11.260 --> 01:24:15.221
<v Speaker 2>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen death like from a foot away </v>

1898
01:24:15.221 --> 01:24:16.690
<v Speaker 2>and from a mile away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1899
01:24:16.720 --> 01:24:19.100
<v Speaker 2>so like there's no range of death I </v>
<v Speaker 2>haven't seen.</v>

1900
01:24:19.160 --> 01:24:21.380
<v Speaker 2>So if anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I value life more.</v>

1901
01:24:21.381 --> 01:24:22.640
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1902
01:24:22.730 --> 01:24:27.730
<v Speaker 2>I hate war more like I know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I think it's horrible and </v>

1903
01:24:27.730 --> 01:24:31.301
<v Speaker 2>disgusting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but without a doubt I think it's </v>

1904
01:24:31.301 --> 01:24:31.610
<v Speaker 2>absolutely necessary and,</v>

1905
01:24:32.860 --> 01:24:33.190
<v Speaker 4>and</v>

1906
01:24:33.770 --> 01:24:38.770
<v Speaker 2>needed into such a level that I can't </v>
<v Speaker 2>even imagine what this world would be </v>

1907
01:24:38.770 --> 01:24:43.121
<v Speaker 2>like had we not been involved to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>degree that we've been involved in for </v>

1908
01:24:44.181 --> 01:24:49.181
<v Speaker 2>the past 12 years trying to eradicate </v>
<v Speaker 2>this fanatic group of psychopaths.</v>

1909
01:24:49.730 --> 01:24:53.360
<v Speaker 2>So I don't want to think about what the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world would be like,</v>

1910
01:24:53.390 --> 01:24:53.690
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1911
01:24:53.691 --> 01:24:58.691
<v Speaker 2>I don't want my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my nieces and my nephews or my kids to </v>

1912
01:24:58.691 --> 01:24:59.060
<v Speaker 2>ever have to do what I did or see what I</v>
<v Speaker 2>saw.</v>

1913
01:24:59.690 --> 01:25:00.620
<v Speaker 2>So I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1914
01:25:01.070 --> 01:25:06.070
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hope we never have to invade a </v>

1915
01:25:06.071 --> 01:25:06.580
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1916
01:25:06.581 --> 01:25:08.230
<v Speaker 2>I remember we were talking about Syria.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>

1917
01:25:08.231 --> 01:25:09.220
<v Speaker 2>are we going to go over there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1918
01:25:09.250 --> 01:25:10.060
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1919
01:25:10.061 --> 01:25:10.930
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no,</v>

1920
01:25:11.500 --> 01:25:12.850
<v Speaker 2>there's no need.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no resources.</v>

1921
01:25:12.851 --> 01:25:15.400
<v Speaker 2>There's no necessary element for us to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be involved in.</v>

1922
01:25:15.880 --> 01:25:19.150
<v Speaker 2>But the preservation of human life isn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>that needed.</v>

1923
01:25:19.270 --> 01:25:20.370
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brian,</v>

1924
01:25:20.800 --> 01:25:21.660
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1925
01:25:21.670 --> 01:25:23.020
<v Speaker 2>that's one of the reasons why</v>

1926
01:25:24.620 --> 01:25:28.820
<v Speaker 1>false flags and false flag operations </v>
<v Speaker 1>are so disgusting when you find out that</v>

1927
01:25:28.821 --> 01:25:33.360
<v Speaker 1>someone's lying about the motivation for</v>
<v Speaker 1>profit and that</v>

1928
01:25:33.680 --> 01:25:38.600
<v Speaker 2>nothing worse than somebody that lies </v>
<v Speaker 2>for the benefit of themselves.</v>

1929
01:25:38.790 --> 01:25:43.790
<v Speaker 2>Like Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you're a good looking man and I </v>

1930
01:25:43.790 --> 01:25:44.660
<v Speaker 2>think that dress looks great on you and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it makes you look thin.</v>

1931
01:25:45.350 --> 01:25:49.600
<v Speaker 2>That's no k lice lie sometimes to to </v>
<v Speaker 2>tell you no,</v>

1932
01:25:50.420 --> 01:25:52.220
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's your 28th birthday,</v>

1933
01:25:52.280 --> 01:25:53.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's great to hear.</v>

1934
01:25:53.661 --> 01:25:55.100
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm 40 or whatever.</v>

1935
01:25:55.280 --> 01:25:56.270
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like those,</v>

1936
01:25:56.300 --> 01:25:58.450
<v Speaker 2>those are not self serving lizard cute </v>
<v Speaker 2>laws,</v>

1937
01:25:58.940 --> 01:26:03.940
<v Speaker 2>but when you're lying so that you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>put money in your pocket at the expense </v>

1938
01:26:03.940 --> 01:26:04.820
<v Speaker 2>of human,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hope you burn in hell forever.</v>

1939
01:26:04.900 --> 01:26:06.230
<v Speaker 1>It's a dark law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1940
01:26:06.530 --> 01:26:08.000
<v Speaker 1>it's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very dark lie.</v>

1941
01:26:08.760 --> 01:26:09.630
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a.</v>

1942
01:26:09.631 --> 01:26:12.110
<v Speaker 1>it's a confusing lie too because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1943
01:26:12.111 --> 01:26:12.830
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute.</v>

1944
01:26:12.831 --> 01:26:17.831
<v Speaker 1>This has actually happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you find out about the Gulf of </v>

1945
01:26:17.831 --> 01:26:20.710
<v Speaker 1>Tonkin or operation northwoods,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there have been these moments in </v>

1946
01:26:20.710 --> 01:26:23.510
<v Speaker 1>time where people have tried to figure </v>
<v Speaker 1>out a way to lie in order to drag people</v>

1947
01:26:23.511 --> 01:26:26.000
<v Speaker 1>into war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a war that otherwise the public wouldn't</v>

1948
01:26:26.001 --> 01:26:27.830
<v Speaker 1>support.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a.</v>

1949
01:26:28.220 --> 01:26:30.620
<v Speaker 1>it's dark,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's dark.</v>

1950
01:26:30.640 --> 01:26:34.640
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very weird aspect of society that</v>

1951
01:26:34.790 --> 01:26:36.980
<v Speaker 1>it not only that exists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's ignored.</v>

1952
01:26:37.360 --> 01:26:42.360
<v Speaker 1>It's ignored and almost brushed under </v>
<v Speaker 1>the table when you start talking about </v>

1953
01:26:42.360 --> 01:26:43.490
<v Speaker 1>war and about policy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is something that people don't want</v>

1954
01:26:43.491 --> 01:26:48.491
<v Speaker 1>to acknowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we have been duped by the military </v>

1955
01:26:48.491 --> 01:26:50.120
<v Speaker 1>industrial complex in the past and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it is actually many standard,</v>

1956
01:26:50.450 --> 01:26:55.450
<v Speaker 1>standard operational procedure that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>will come up with different ways in </v>

1957
01:26:55.450 --> 01:26:58.520
<v Speaker 1>order to get people to support Warren.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of them is the lie.</v>

1958
01:26:58.860 --> 01:27:03.200
<v Speaker 1>You know when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when guys come back,</v>

1959
01:27:03.890 --> 01:27:07.190
<v Speaker 1>the big one is ptsd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

1960
01:27:07.191 --> 01:27:12.191
<v Speaker 1>that's the the the hardest aspect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems to to integrate back into a </v>

1961
01:27:13.011 --> 01:27:15.950
<v Speaker 1>normal society with normal life and </v>
<v Speaker 1>normal jobs and normal.</v>

1962
01:27:16.280 --> 01:27:19.100
<v Speaker 1>Just the things that we all just deal </v>
<v Speaker 1>with on a regular basis.</v>

1963
01:27:19.250 --> 01:27:22.700
<v Speaker 1>For some folks it becomes almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>unbearable.</v>

1964
01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:28.000
<v Speaker 1>What is the difference between people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that integrate smoothly and people that </v>

1965
01:27:28.731 --> 01:27:30.350
<v Speaker 1>have an incredibly difficult time,</v>

1966
01:27:31.260 --> 01:27:31.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from,</v>

1967
01:27:31.710 --> 01:27:35.760
<v Speaker 2>from that incredibly difficult time to </v>
<v Speaker 2>smoothly are all scales,</v>

1968
01:27:35.790 --> 01:27:40.790
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the biggest or the factors are the </v>

1969
01:27:40.790 --> 01:27:42.030
<v Speaker 2>degrees of coping mechanisms that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that an individual has.</v>

1970
01:27:42.750 --> 01:27:44.640
<v Speaker 2>I have a very strong family,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1971
01:27:44.641 --> 01:27:46.980
<v Speaker 2>like an amazing wife.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fantastic father and mother.</v>

1972
01:27:46.981 --> 01:27:49.380
<v Speaker 2>They're still married.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Amazing brother and sister.</v>

1973
01:27:49.440 --> 01:27:51.210
<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like so family unit.</v>

1974
01:27:51.211 --> 01:27:54.570
<v Speaker 2>Very supportive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm very fit and very healthy.</v>

1975
01:27:54.670 --> 01:27:59.670
<v Speaker 2>I'm well educated as well trained.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are all different mechanisms to </v>

1976
01:27:59.670 --> 01:28:00.930
<v Speaker 2>deal with stress.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody deals with stress differently,</v>

1977
01:28:01.290 --> 01:28:04.440
<v Speaker 2>but the foundation of how you deal with </v>
<v Speaker 2>stress,</v>

1978
01:28:04.680 --> 01:28:09.680
<v Speaker 2>you have to have these fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 2>elements to be able to do the more of </v>

1979
01:28:09.680 --> 01:28:10.110
<v Speaker 2>them that you have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more stress you can deal with.</v>

1980
01:28:10.590 --> 01:28:15.570
<v Speaker 2>So a guy like me that was ranger sniper,</v>
<v Speaker 2>green baret like killed.</v>

1981
01:28:15.571 --> 01:28:19.710

<v Speaker 2>well at night,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1983
01:28:20.190 --> 01:28:21.630
<v Speaker 2>I had to adjust.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are things that,</v>

1984
01:28:21.840 --> 01:28:24.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I had moments where a guy smoking a</v>

<v Speaker 2>he smells,</v>

1987
01:28:30.270 --> 01:28:34.650
<v Speaker 2>listening to music from that culture </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I just spent six,</v>

1988
01:28:35.140 --> 01:28:36.600
<v Speaker 2>six months with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1994
01:28:48.650 --> 01:28:48.930
<v Speaker 2>was an example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This guy driving a yellow bmw,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Like I just got back a couple of days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>letter later and I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>like that was years ago when I first </v>

2043
01:30:51.720 --> 01:30:51.720
<v Speaker 2>came back after,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2045
01:30:54.310 --> 01:30:57.760

<v Speaker 2>but I'm,</v>

2046
01:30:57.970 --> 01:31:02.710
<v Speaker 2>the special forces unit by design is </v>
<v Speaker 2>very tight and you know,</v>

2047
01:31:02.711 --> 01:31:07.711
<v Speaker 2>like if you're having issues I can go to</v>
<v Speaker 2>my team sergeant or I can go to my </v>

2048
01:31:07.711 --> 01:31:07.711
<v Speaker 2>senior and bounce things off off of </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

2049
01:31:08.230 --> 01:31:13.230
<v Speaker 2>I get really resentful over people </v>
<v Speaker 2>making snap judgments about these guys </v>

2050
01:31:13.391 --> 01:31:14.800
<v Speaker 2>that are coming back and having issues,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

01:31:20.591 --> 01:31:22.480
<v Speaker 2>They're like the greatest human beings </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the planet.</v>

2055
01:31:22.481 --> 01:31:27.481
<v Speaker 2>You don't like one in a million,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have not one was a very small percentage</v>

2056
01:31:27.641 --> 01:31:32.641
<v Speaker 2>have serious issues,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we have to have our eyes wide open </v>

2057
01:31:32.641 --> 01:31:35.770
<v Speaker 2>about how to deal with posttraumatic </v>
<v Speaker 2>stress and um,</v>

2058
01:31:35.890 --> 01:31:39.160
<v Speaker 2>there's not one easy solution and it's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of hard work to get there.</v>

2059
01:31:39.510 --> 01:31:44.510
<v Speaker 1>It's not one easy solution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's not one standard set of </v>

2060
01:31:44.510 --> 01:31:47.821
<v Speaker 1>experiences that each veteran </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiences over there and brings back </v>

2061
01:31:47.821 --> 01:31:47.821
<v Speaker 1>with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all,</v>

2062
01:31:47.821 --> 01:31:51.931
<v Speaker 1>it varies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's such an important thing that </v>

2063
01:31:51.931 --> 01:31:52.450
<v Speaker 1>you said about the coping mechanisms </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you have in place.</v>

2064
01:31:53.110 --> 01:31:54.800
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

<v Speaker 1>them strengthen their coping</v>

2067

<v Speaker 2>mechanisms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>help them deal with situations.</v>

2068
01:32:02.590 --> 01:32:06.220
<v Speaker 2>What kind of support did they offer you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now,</v>

2069

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've been at war for a long time.</v>

01:32:31.740 --> 01:32:31.740
<v Speaker 2>like American life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is normal to everybody else,</v>

2082
01:32:31.740 --> 01:32:36.421
<v Speaker 2>unless you've been in a plywood building</v>
<v Speaker 2>for 12 months and now you're back </v>

<v Speaker 2>So like if you have a serious physical </v>

2095

<v Speaker 2>ailment from battle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's internal or physical,</v>

<v Speaker 2>me that's on steroids or do I want the </v>

2149
01:35:18.401 --> 01:35:20.090
<v Speaker 2>one that can barely walk because </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything hurts so bad?</v>

2150
01:35:20.440 --> 01:35:21.340
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2151
01:35:21.350 --> 01:35:22.790
<v Speaker 2>with a 38 year old on steroids.</v>

2152
01:35:23.110 --> 01:35:28.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that sort of brings up what we were </v>

2153
01:35:28.110 --> 01:35:30.140
<v Speaker 1>talking about before where it's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the discussion of tea,</v>

2154
01:35:30.141 --> 01:35:33.940
<v Speaker 1>our tea when it comes to a mixed martial</v>
<v Speaker 1>arts training,</v>

2155
01:35:34.330 --> 01:35:37.400
<v Speaker 1>a testosterone replacement therapy for </v>
<v Speaker 1>sewer.</v>

2156
01:35:38.050 --> 01:35:40.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For folks who don't know this,</v>

2157
01:35:40.860 --> 01:35:45.860
<v Speaker 1>this debate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not mixed martial arts fans and </v>

2158
01:35:45.860 --> 01:35:46.120
<v Speaker 1>now there's probably a lot of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>listening to this that aren't,</v>

2159
01:35:46.230 --> 01:35:48.850
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a long time,</v>

2160
01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:50.440
<v Speaker 1>over a year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two years,</v>

2161
01:35:50.560 --> 01:35:55.560
<v Speaker 1>whatever it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were allowed to get prescribed </v>

2162
01:35:55.560 --> 01:35:58.501
<v Speaker 1>testosterone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Brendan Schaub said it best when </v>

2163
01:35:58.501 --> 01:35:59.890
<v Speaker 1>we're discussing it on the podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said that there's,</v>

2164
01:35:59.980 --> 01:36:04.390
<v Speaker 1>there's youth and with youth you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>elevated hormone levels,</v>

2165
01:36:04.391 --> 01:36:07.180
<v Speaker 1>but you have a lack of experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have a lack of knowledge.</v>

2166
01:36:07.390 --> 01:36:11.350
<v Speaker 1>And then as you get older you get wiser,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get smarter,</v>

2167
01:36:11.351 --> 01:36:16.351
<v Speaker 1>you have more knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the body just does not respond the </v>

2168
01:36:16.351 --> 01:36:16.351
<v Speaker 1>way it used to.</v>

2169
01:36:16.351 --> 01:36:17.620
<v Speaker 1>And Eve Edwards was talking to him and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he was saying,</v>

2170
01:36:17.621 --> 01:36:18.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2171
01:36:18.900 --> 01:36:20.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like 37 now.</v>

2172
01:36:20.531 --> 01:36:22.300
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know so much now,</v>

2173
01:36:22.330 --> 01:36:24.640
<v Speaker 1>but my body just doesn't listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just doesn't,</v>

2174
01:36:24.880 --> 01:36:29.880
<v Speaker 1>doesn't do what it did when I was 20 and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know as much and that this is </v>

2175
01:36:29.880 --> 01:36:31.240
<v Speaker 1>the name of Eve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's great guy.</v>

2176
01:36:31.241 --> 01:36:36.241
<v Speaker 1>But there's that nature balance that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of stopped and it's placed with </v>

2177
01:36:38.111 --> 01:36:43.111
<v Speaker 1>injections of testosterone and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're introducing this weird element </v>

2178
01:36:43.111 --> 01:36:47.620
<v Speaker 1>into one of the most dangerous sports </v>
<v Speaker 1>competitions the world has ever known.</v>

2179
01:36:47.860 --> 01:36:49.480
<v Speaker 1>Mixed martial arts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the most.</v>

2180
01:36:49.660 --> 01:36:52.840
<v Speaker 1>There's more on the line as far as your </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotions.</v>

2181
01:36:52.841 --> 01:36:55.420
<v Speaker 1>Your physical body is at risk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's always.</v>

2182
01:36:55.660 --> 01:36:58.720
<v Speaker 1>And you're sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're changing nature.</v>

2183
01:36:58.840 --> 01:37:03.840
<v Speaker 1>You're making it so that these old wise </v>
<v Speaker 1>people now are Jews to the gills and </v>

2184
01:37:04.181 --> 01:37:08.890
<v Speaker 1>they can train 17 hours a fucking day </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it gets real weird.</v>

2185
01:37:09.070 --> 01:37:14.070
<v Speaker 1>It gets real weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One that's for awhile was accepted by </v>

2186
01:37:14.070 --> 01:37:14.200
<v Speaker 1>athletic commissions.</v>

2187
01:37:14.520 --> 01:37:16.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The youth is wasted on the young,</v>

2188
01:37:16.670 --> 01:37:21.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that expression is like you have </v>

2189
01:37:21.670 --> 01:37:21.670
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2190
01:37:21.670 --> 01:37:26.300
<v Speaker 2>I'm 34.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been doing martial arts for </v>

2191
01:37:26.300 --> 01:37:28.551
<v Speaker 2>forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want the body of a 22 year old with </v>

2192
01:37:28.551 --> 01:37:28.551
<v Speaker 2>what I know now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right now,</v>

2193
01:37:28.551 --> 01:37:30.780
<v Speaker 2>but I can chemically do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2194
01:37:30.840 --> 01:37:35.840
<v Speaker 2>with through testosterone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is what guys have been able to do </v>

2195
01:37:35.840 --> 01:37:36.600
<v Speaker 2>for the past couple of years and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>dangerous,</v>

2196
01:37:36.630 --> 01:37:37.840
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like in,</v>

2197
01:37:37.890 --> 01:37:38.310
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2198
01:37:38.780 --> 01:37:40.770
<v Speaker 2>if it was golf,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't care,</v>

2199
01:37:40.800 --> 01:37:45.800
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it's baseball and like Sam was Sammy </v>

2200
01:37:45.800 --> 01:37:45.800
<v Speaker 2>Sosa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mark mcgwire era.</v>

2201
01:37:45.800 --> 01:37:48.960
<v Speaker 2>I don't really care,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we're in a sport where we're hitting</v>

2202
01:37:48.961 --> 01:37:51.480
<v Speaker 2>each other in the face and choking each </v>
<v Speaker 2>other unconscious.</v>

2203
01:37:51.830 --> 01:37:56.830
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we do not need the advantage of taking </v>

2204
01:37:56.830 --> 01:38:01.071
<v Speaker 2>the years of experience of doing martial</v>
<v Speaker 2>arts for 20 some odd years and then </v>

2205
01:38:01.071 --> 01:38:03.430
<v Speaker 2>giving us bodies of 20 year olds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2206
01:38:03.480 --> 01:38:05.250
<v Speaker 2>the physicality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the recovery,</v>

2207
01:38:05.850 --> 01:38:07.910
<v Speaker 2>the responsiveness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

2208
01:38:08.050 --> 01:38:10.470
<v Speaker 2>it's horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You guys have been doing it.</v>

2209
01:38:10.530 --> 01:38:12.040
<v Speaker 2>And now we're at this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

2210
01:38:12.060 --> 01:38:14.160
<v Speaker 2>this juncture where we're now saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2211
01:38:14.161 --> 01:38:19.161
<v Speaker 2>it's not okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you can't have an athletic </v>

2212
01:38:19.161 --> 01:38:21.591
<v Speaker 2>commission allow you to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So does that mean the guys are going to </v>

2213
01:38:21.591 --> 01:38:25.311
<v Speaker 2>do it on the side and do orally?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they don't because they know where </v>

2214
01:38:25.311 --> 01:38:25.590
<v Speaker 2>they're going to get tested or now </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not being monitored.</v>

2215
01:38:25.591 --> 01:38:28.230
<v Speaker 2>So there's going to do it whenever and </v>
<v Speaker 2>however they want.</v>

2216
01:38:28.650 --> 01:38:30.570
<v Speaker 2>Like what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>

2217
01:38:30.740 --> 01:38:31.410
<v Speaker 2>It's scary.</v>

2218
01:38:31.510 --> 01:38:34.180
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's weird because there were a few guys</v>

2219
01:38:34.181 --> 01:38:39.181
<v Speaker 1>that were on it for several years and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they were being very successful while </v>

2220
01:38:39.181 --> 01:38:40.720
<v Speaker 1>they were on it and then all of a sudden</v>
<v Speaker 1>it gets pulled away.</v>

2221
01:38:40.930 --> 01:38:45.930
<v Speaker 1>So what do they do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do they try to bring their body up to </v>

2222
01:38:45.930 --> 01:38:45.930
<v Speaker 1>natural levels?</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

2223
01:38:45.930 --> 01:38:47.350
<v Speaker 1>but that takes time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It takes a long time.</v>

2224
01:38:47.490 --> 01:38:48.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for like a,</v>

2225
01:38:48.760 --> 01:38:53.760
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say a hypothetical 37 year old </v>

2226
01:38:53.760 --> 01:38:56.531
<v Speaker 2>that's been on testosterone for four or </v>
<v Speaker 2>five years and then he can't have it </v>

2227
01:38:56.531 --> 01:38:59.951
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to take that guy a long time </v>

2228
01:38:59.951 --> 01:39:03.850
<v Speaker 2>if ever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be able to naturally produce </v>

2229
01:39:03.850 --> 01:39:03.850
<v Speaker 2>testosterone</v>

2230
01:39:03.850 --> 01:39:03.850
<v Speaker 1>and he'll never have the levels that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>had when he was.</v>

2231
01:39:03.850 --> 01:39:08.340
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the levels he's had when he was </v>

2232
01:39:08.340 --> 01:39:10.271
<v Speaker 1>on it for 25 year olds levels and the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other thing is the things that you </v>

2233
01:39:10.271 --> 01:39:14.771
<v Speaker 1>can take to bring your levels back up or</v>
<v Speaker 1>also banned things like clomid and all </v>

2234
01:39:14.771 --> 01:39:19.151
<v Speaker 1>these different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their estrogen or estrogen suppressing </v>

2235
01:39:19.311 --> 01:39:22.430
<v Speaker 1>devices.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These all these different chemicals that</v>

2236
01:39:22.670 --> 01:39:25.670
<v Speaker 1>people do post steroids cycle are also </v>
<v Speaker 1>illegal,</v>

2237
01:39:26.060 --> 01:39:30.260
<v Speaker 1>so it becomes like that was what I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>Dennis seaver got popped for.</v>

2238
01:39:30.440 --> 01:39:35.440
<v Speaker 1>He got popped for one of these posts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>steroids cycle things and now he's on </v>

2239
01:39:36.591 --> 01:39:38.270
<v Speaker 1>the shelf for nine months because of </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

2240
01:39:38.630 --> 01:39:39.190
<v Speaker 1>People are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>

2241
01:39:39.191 --> 01:39:40.130
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why was that guy?</v>

2242
01:39:40.640 --> 01:39:43.130
<v Speaker 1>He failed a drug test because he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>blocking estrogen.</v>

2243
01:39:43.870 --> 01:39:45.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to or otherwise you're going to</v>

2244
01:39:45.711 --> 01:39:49.310
<v Speaker 1>grow breasts after you've been using </v>
<v Speaker 1>anabolic steroids and testosterone.</v>

2245
01:39:49.311 --> 01:39:54.311
<v Speaker 1>It's like you have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you will see there's there's </v>

2246
01:39:54.311 --> 01:39:54.680
<v Speaker 1>testosterone replacement.</v>

2247
01:39:54.680 --> 01:39:57.200
<v Speaker 1>Like if you went to a doctor and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

2248
01:39:57.440 --> 01:39:59.390
<v Speaker 1>Hey doc,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm 60 years old.</v>

2249
01:40:00.380 --> 01:40:03.170
<v Speaker 1>I would like to get on some testosterone</v>
<v Speaker 1>and have a better quality of life.</v>

2250
01:40:03.220 --> 01:40:08.220
<v Speaker 1>The doctor will give you a slow dose of </v>
<v Speaker 1>testosterone slowly ramp you up.</v>

2251
01:40:08.420 --> 01:40:09.860
<v Speaker 1>He's not gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bam,</v>

2252
01:40:09.861 --> 01:40:11.840
<v Speaker 1>Jack you and turn you into a 20 year </v>
<v Speaker 1>old,</v>

2253
01:40:12.110 --> 01:40:17.110
<v Speaker 1>but with a lot of fighters are doing is </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're taking way more than you would </v>

2254
01:40:17.110 --> 01:40:18.560
<v Speaker 1>have when you were 20 and what happens </v>
<v Speaker 1>is your body goes,</v>

2255
01:40:18.710 --> 01:40:21.350
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is going on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it grows tits.</v>

2256
01:40:21.590 --> 01:40:26.590
<v Speaker 1>Literally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your body starts producing massive </v>

2257
01:40:26.590 --> 01:40:28.751
<v Speaker 1>amounts of estrogen to counteract a </v>
<v Speaker 1>massive amounts of testosterone in your </v>

2258
01:40:28.751 --> 01:40:33.101
<v Speaker 1>body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gets so confused as to these levels of </v>

2259
01:40:33.101 --> 01:40:35.741
<v Speaker 1>hormones that are completely </v>
<v Speaker 1>supernatural in your body and under </v>

2260
01:40:35.741 --> 01:40:36.920
<v Speaker 1>those conditions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>under those conditions,</v>

2261
01:40:36.921 --> 01:40:41.921
<v Speaker 1>you develop bitch tits and a lot of guys</v>
<v Speaker 1>have had them and you'll see this weird </v>

2262
01:40:41.921 --> 01:40:46.390
<v Speaker 1>like thing that you see these jelly like</v>
<v Speaker 1>growing around their nipples.</v>

2263
01:40:46.641 --> 01:40:51.641
<v Speaker 1>And I've seen guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether they bounce up and down in the </v>

2264
01:40:51.641 --> 01:40:52.070
<v Speaker 1>cage and they're there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have tents.</v>

2265
01:40:52.071 --> 01:40:52.320
<v Speaker 1>It's</v>

2266
01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:58.000
<v Speaker 2>remarkable to me where people don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand like we're a pugilistic </v>

2267

2268
01:41:02.901 --> 01:41:02.901

01:41:58.950 --> 01:41:59.170
<v Speaker 2>for trt because there's a bigger problem</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the,</v>

2293
01:41:59.440 --> 01:42:03.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the entire sport where a,</v>

2294
01:42:04.180 --> 01:42:07.780
<v Speaker 2>he in my opinion just personified a </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem and then you know,</v>

2295
01:42:07.781 --> 01:42:12.781
<v Speaker 2>everybody like pinned everything on him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it was a big problem throughout the </v>

2296
01:42:12.781 --> 01:42:14.290
<v Speaker 2>whole entire sports which is performance</v>
<v Speaker 2>enhancing drugs.</v>

2297
01:42:14.590 --> 01:42:19.590
<v Speaker 2>And is it right for a 37 year old dude </v>
<v Speaker 2>like theater bell for it to be on </v>

2298
01:42:19.590 --> 01:42:23.830
<v Speaker 2>testosterone for five years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look amazing and fantastic while he's on</v>

2299
01:42:23.831 --> 01:42:28.090
<v Speaker 2>it and nothing like he did five years </v>
<v Speaker 2>ago where he was struggling,</v>

2300
01:42:28.300 --> 01:42:29.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like winning a fight,</v>

2301
01:42:29.741 --> 01:42:34.741
<v Speaker 2>losing a fight when now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now he's like knocking guys out with </v>

2302
01:42:34.741 --> 01:42:34.900
<v Speaker 2>crazy fight of the night,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fight of the year,</v>

2303
01:42:35.110 --> 01:42:37.270
<v Speaker 2>like knockout of the night,</v>
<v Speaker 2>knock out of the year type stuff.</v>

2304
01:42:37.670 --> 01:42:38.350
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2305
01:42:38.351 --> 01:42:43.351
<v Speaker 2>you can't have that turnaround.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then like stopped testosterone and </v>

2306
01:42:43.351 --> 01:42:43.690
<v Speaker 2>two months later he's ready to go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2307
01:42:43.700 --> 01:42:44.830
<v Speaker 2>that's chemical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2308
01:42:44.831 --> 01:42:46.690
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't work that way.</v>

2309
01:42:46.950 --> 01:42:51.950
<v Speaker 2>How does a guy get off of it in that </v>
<v Speaker 2>short of a time and then have the </v>

2310
01:42:52.211 --> 01:42:57.211
<v Speaker 2>ability to compete again?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would seem like it would take like a </v>

2311
01:42:57.211 --> 01:42:57.211
<v Speaker 2>year to just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if ever.</v>

2312
01:42:57.211 --> 01:42:58.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chemically.</v>

2313
01:42:59.470 --> 01:43:00.990
<v Speaker 2>There's no way around it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2314
01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:01.420
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2315
01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:02.670
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

2316
01:43:02.680 --> 01:43:04.120
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

2317
01:43:04.121 --> 01:43:06.640
<v Speaker 2>But having been a professional athlete </v>
<v Speaker 2>for 13 years,</v>

2318
01:43:06.641 --> 01:43:11.641
<v Speaker 2>I've never seen somebody that was so </v>
<v Speaker 2>responsive to testosterone like,</v>

2319
01:43:13.180 --> 01:43:18.180
<v Speaker 2>like he was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then come clean and try to be an </v>

2320
01:43:18.180 --> 01:43:22.681
<v Speaker 2>athlete like he like they wore when they</v>
<v Speaker 2>are using performance enhancing drugs </v>

2321
01:43:22.681 --> 01:43:26.250
<v Speaker 2>afterwards and just like miraculously </v>
<v Speaker 2>been as good as they were when they are </v>

2322
01:43:26.621 --> 01:43:27.940
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It never has never happened.</v>

2323
01:43:27.941 --> 01:43:30.610
<v Speaker 2>I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't think of like a single sport,</v>

2324
01:43:30.760 --> 01:43:34.390
<v Speaker 2>a single sportsmen in history where they</v>
<v Speaker 2>got popped.</v>

2325
01:43:34.750 --> 01:43:38.380
<v Speaker 2>They are watched closely and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>performed as well after that point.</v>

2326
01:43:39.940 --> 01:43:40.630
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ever.</v>

2327
01:43:41.050 --> 01:43:43.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I completely agree with you that it's so</v>

2328
01:43:43.541 --> 01:43:45.850
<v Speaker 2>different than baseball and all these </v>
<v Speaker 2>other things.</v>

2329
01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:51.000
<v Speaker 2>What I don't like about the baseball,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a steroid controversy is that a young </v>

2330
01:43:51.621 --> 01:43:51.980
<v Speaker 2>kid</v>

2331
01:43:51.980 --> 01:43:55.790
<v Speaker 1>who's coming up who wants to play </v>
<v Speaker 1>baseball almost has to do it in order to</v>

2332
01:43:55.791 --> 01:44:00.791
<v Speaker 1>compete.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when there's a guy like Mark Mcguire </v>

2333
01:44:00.791 --> 01:44:00.830
<v Speaker 1>who's juice to the gills crushing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ball out of the stadium,</v>

2334
01:44:01.340 --> 01:44:04.100
<v Speaker 1>a young guy coming up that wants to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>like Mark Mcguire,</v>

2335
01:44:05.350 --> 01:44:10.350
<v Speaker 1>most likely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you have incredible genetics and </v>

2336
01:44:10.350 --> 01:44:12.250
<v Speaker 1>genetic specimen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just a weird freak of nature.</v>

2337
01:44:12.251 --> 01:44:13.570
<v Speaker 1>Some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2338
01:44:13.600 --> 01:44:18.600
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some guy was just the extreme mesomorph </v>

2339
01:44:18.600 --> 01:44:18.600
<v Speaker 1>you'll probably knock it ever be able to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do that.</v>

2340
01:44:18.600 --> 01:44:20.100
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2341
01:44:20.110 --> 01:44:23.380
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that to me sucks that a young guy has to</v>

2342
01:44:23.381 --> 01:44:28.381
<v Speaker 1>risk his endocrine system and put it in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's such a big difference </v>

2343
01:44:28.381 --> 01:44:30.020
<v Speaker 1>between that and a combat sport.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2344
01:44:31.220 --> 01:44:33.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the solution is.</v>

2345
01:44:33.300 --> 01:44:38.300
<v Speaker 2>Testing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>testing right around testing random </v>

2346
01:44:38.300 --> 01:44:38.800
<v Speaker 2>testing in fight camp post-fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2347
01:44:38.820 --> 01:44:40.030
<v Speaker 2>like right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2348
01:44:41.080 --> 01:44:42.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fought two weeks ago.</v>

2349
01:44:42.490 --> 01:44:44.650
<v Speaker 2>I'm getting back into training two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three times a day.</v>

2350
01:44:44.920 --> 01:44:47.560
<v Speaker 2>Like this is when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is when a guy test them,</v>

2351
01:44:47.770 --> 01:44:48.810
<v Speaker 2>test them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2352
01:44:48.910 --> 01:44:50.310
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just show up high.</v>

2353
01:44:50.460 --> 01:44:53.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe Silva is about to throw an offer,</v>

2354
01:44:53.440 --> 01:44:54.130

<v Speaker 2>he knows he's gonna throw it off from my</v>

2356
01:44:57.760 --> 01:45:00.340
<v Speaker 2>way before he throws the off from my </v>
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>

2357
01:45:00.640 --> 01:45:05.640
<v Speaker 2>a guy from the athletic commission to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the respective state that I'm going to </v>

2358
01:45:05.640 --> 01:45:05.640
<v Speaker 2>be fighting in shows up and says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

2359

<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2360
01:45:07.150 --> 01:45:10.920
<v Speaker 2>that's how you're going to get a fair,</v>
<v Speaker 2>equal system,</v>

2361
01:45:11.200 --> 01:45:13.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not where you sit.</v>

2362
01:45:13.250 --> 01:45:14.530
<v Speaker 2>Tell a guy in Brazil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

2363
01:45:14.531 --> 01:45:15.970
<v Speaker 2>you need to come up here and take a drug</v>
<v Speaker 2>test.</v>

2364
01:45:15.971 --> 01:45:17.730
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah man,</v>

2365
01:45:17.860 --> 01:45:19.960
<v Speaker 2>I'll be there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like four days.</v>

2366
01:45:20.360 --> 01:45:21.520
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no dude,</v>

2367
01:45:21.521 --> 01:45:26.521
<v Speaker 2>like athletic commission guy shows up </v>
<v Speaker 2>the randomly and.</v>

2368
01:45:27.700 --> 01:45:28.870
<v Speaker 2>Right they're feeding of the cup</v>

2369
01:45:28.990 --> 01:45:33.990
<v Speaker 1>and when you catch someone it can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it should be more than nine </v>

2370
01:45:33.990 --> 01:45:37.771
<v Speaker 1>months and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think in this day and age you should </v>

2371
01:45:37.771 --> 01:45:37.771
<v Speaker 1>let everybody know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey look,</v>

2372
01:45:37.771 --> 01:45:42.330
<v Speaker 1>we're going to cut you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to fight for this </v>

2373
01:45:42.330 --> 01:45:42.730
<v Speaker 1>organization anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And let them know and then just say,</v>

2374
01:45:42.731 --> 01:45:44.080
<v Speaker 1>this is the rule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>

2375
01:45:44.160 --> 01:45:47.200
<v Speaker 1>this is where we're at right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So everyone's been served.</v>

2376
01:45:47.201 --> 01:45:52.201
<v Speaker 1>Notice everyone knows what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>repercussions are of this illegal </v>

2377
01:45:52.201 --> 01:45:55.321
<v Speaker 1>activity that puts people in jeopardy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My real concern is medical science is </v>

2378
01:45:55.841 --> 01:45:59.550
<v Speaker 1>not going to stop medical science and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the.</v>

2379
01:45:59.670 --> 01:46:01.300
<v Speaker 1>The innovative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2380
01:46:01.400 --> 01:46:03.420
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way guys are going to sleep,</v>

2381
01:46:03.820 --> 01:46:07.350
<v Speaker 1>not just cheap but just the things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to come up with to,</v>

2382
01:46:07.410 --> 01:46:12.410
<v Speaker 1>to change the human body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's restorative capabilities of new </v>

2383
01:46:12.410 --> 01:46:16.651
<v Speaker 1>advancements and new techniques.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you could say that like getting in </v>

2384
01:46:16.691 --> 01:46:18.070
<v Speaker 1>that cryo chamber.</v>

2385
01:46:18.070 --> 01:46:21.490
<v Speaker 1>If you can do that cryo chamber and </v>
<v Speaker 1>another guy can't do that cryo chamber,</v>

2386
01:46:21.491 --> 01:46:24.160
<v Speaker 1>do you have an advantage?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it an unfair advantage?</v>

2387
01:46:24.460 --> 01:46:25.930
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where do you draw the line?</v>

2388
01:46:25.960 --> 01:46:28.780
<v Speaker 1>Because should you be able to take </v>
<v Speaker 1>creatine will create a teen's legal?</v>

2389
01:46:28.781 --> 01:46:31.630
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't that increase muscle power?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it does,</v>

2390
01:46:31.870 --> 01:46:33.400
<v Speaker 1>it increases your ability to work </v>
<v Speaker 1>harder.</v>

2391
01:46:33.580 --> 01:46:35.980
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where is the line?</v>

2392
01:46:36.010 --> 01:46:41.010
<v Speaker 1>Can you take tribulus can you take on </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's t plus we're having great results </v>

2393
01:46:42.251 --> 01:46:46.420
<v Speaker 1>with that t plus stuff where guys are </v>
<v Speaker 1>showing he's 50 percent increases in,</v>

2394
01:46:46.421 --> 01:46:46.950
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

2395
01:46:46.980 --> 01:46:51.980
<v Speaker 1>in rates of lifting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're there the rate of progress </v>

2396
01:46:51.980 --> 01:46:53.420
<v Speaker 1>over people that are not taking it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>double blind placebos.</v>

2397
01:46:53.421 --> 01:46:54.600
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>When,</v>

2398
01:46:54.601 --> 01:46:59.601
<v Speaker 1>when do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when does it become legal and when it's </v>

2399
01:46:59.601 --> 01:47:01.971
<v Speaker 1>become cheating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when is it like a nice supplement and </v>

2400
01:47:01.971 --> 01:47:03.540
<v Speaker 1>when is it a performance enhancing drug?</v>

2401
01:47:04.130 --> 01:47:09.110
<v Speaker 2>I think one of the big things is what </v>
<v Speaker 2>does it do to your body in the long run?</v>

2402
01:47:09.290 --> 01:47:13.430
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're using it as a supplement,</v>

2403
01:47:13.431 --> 01:47:18.431
<v Speaker 2>we'll just call them all supplements </v>
<v Speaker 2>that will just even remove performance </v>

2404
01:47:18.431 --> 01:47:18.431
<v Speaker 2>enhancing drugs from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from,</v>

2405
01:47:18.431 --> 01:47:18.920
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the discussion,</v>

2406
01:47:18.921 --> 01:47:23.921
<v Speaker 2>just a supplement that does in the short</v>
<v Speaker 2>term great benefits in the long term,</v>

2407
01:47:25.100 --> 01:47:25.940
<v Speaker 2>big damage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2408
01:47:25.941 --> 01:47:29.720
<v Speaker 2>when you have wwe stars that are dying </v>
<v Speaker 2>at 41 from heart attacks,</v>

2409
01:47:29.830 --> 01:47:31.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Lo and behold,</v>

2410
01:47:31.161 --> 01:47:32.750
<v Speaker 2>they've been doing steroids for 12 </v>
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

2411
01:47:33.130 --> 01:47:33.440
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2412
01:47:33.490 --> 01:47:34.580
<v Speaker 2>it's tragic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's sad,</v>

2413
01:47:34.640 --> 01:47:35.180
<v Speaker 2>but not</v>

2414
01:47:35.290 --> 01:47:37.750
<v Speaker 1>pricing isn't a lot of those guys that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the pain pills,</v>

2415
01:47:38.260 --> 01:47:41.890
<v Speaker 1>those guys are folks who don't respect </v>
<v Speaker 1>pro wrestlers either.</v>

2416
01:47:41.891 --> 01:47:43.390
<v Speaker 1>I know a lot of people think that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2417
01:47:43.391 --> 01:47:44.650
<v Speaker 1>it's all fake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Silly.</v>

2418
01:47:45.100 --> 01:47:50.100
<v Speaker 1>Those guys work hard at is image their </v>
<v Speaker 1>bodies all the time.</v>

2419
01:47:51.040 --> 01:47:54.580
<v Speaker 1>If you watch those guys flying through </v>
<v Speaker 1>the air and jumping on each other,</v>

2420
01:47:54.581 --> 01:47:57.640
<v Speaker 1>that's not a free ride.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're getting hurt all the time.</v>

2421
01:47:57.910 --> 01:48:02.320
<v Speaker 1>And a huge problem in that world is guys</v>
<v Speaker 1>that get hooked on pain pills,</v>

2422
01:48:02.321 --> 01:48:04.540
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well the damage</v>

2423
01:48:04.650 --> 01:48:06.930
<v Speaker 2>body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then they have a show next Saturday.</v>

2424
01:48:07.900 --> 01:48:09.720
<v Speaker 2>They have to like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2425
01:48:09.810 --> 01:48:10.680
<v Speaker 2>Mcmahon's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2426
01:48:10.720 --> 01:48:13.680
<v Speaker 2>you got to perform bro.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's like you're your own contract.</v>

2427
01:48:13.681 --> 01:48:14.780
<v Speaker 2>You're going to get paid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2428
01:48:15.120 --> 01:48:18.750
<v Speaker 2>I can't move my hands right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I can't use my fingers.</v>

2429
01:48:18.910 --> 01:48:20.100
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well take this,</v>

2430
01:48:20.410 --> 01:48:25.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now everything doesn't hurt and you'll </v>

2431
01:48:25.410 --> 01:48:25.410
<v Speaker 2>be able to perform</v>

2432
01:48:25.410 --> 01:48:25.750
<v Speaker 1>because that's what's important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2433
01:48:25.830 --> 01:48:30.830
<v Speaker 1>Becomes like a thing where there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's things that you can take that </v>

2434
01:48:30.830 --> 01:48:32.370
<v Speaker 1>elevate your body's natural production </v>
<v Speaker 1>of testosterone and they,</v>

2435
01:48:32.371 --> 01:48:37.371
<v Speaker 1>they can enhance your body's production,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what they don't do is introduced </v>

2436
01:48:37.371 --> 01:48:39.430
<v Speaker 1>synthetic versions of it that shut down </v>
<v Speaker 1>your endocrine system.</v>

2437
01:48:39.640 --> 01:48:44.640
<v Speaker 1>What they don't do is give you these </v>
<v Speaker 1>hyper human levels that are causing you </v>

2438
01:48:44.640 --> 01:48:46.150
<v Speaker 1>to grow tits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2439
01:48:46.340 --> 01:48:51.340
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's got to be like a comfortable </v>

2440
01:48:51.340 --> 01:48:54.511
<v Speaker 1>medium between eating healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>having benefits like the cryo chamber </v>

2441
01:48:54.521 --> 01:48:57.070
<v Speaker 1>and all these different things that do </v>
<v Speaker 1>enhance recovery.</v>

2442
01:48:57.490 --> 01:49:00.400
<v Speaker 1>But don't put you in your body in </v>
<v Speaker 1>danger.</v>

2443
01:49:00.401 --> 01:49:03.880
<v Speaker 1>Don't burn you out in the short term,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2444
01:49:04.090 --> 01:49:06.040
<v Speaker 1>to give you the rest of your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

2445
01:49:06.080 --> 01:49:06.970
<v Speaker 1>you're fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2446
01:49:06.971 --> 01:49:09.850
<v Speaker 1>from 35 on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your body's just devastated.</v>

2447
01:49:09.960 --> 01:49:11.420
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not going to be black and white.</v>

2448
01:49:11.421 --> 01:49:13.490
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not going to be a line drawn in the</v>

2449
01:49:13.491 --> 01:49:14.120
<v Speaker 2>sand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2450
01:49:14.121 --> 01:49:15.950
<v Speaker 2>that line needs to be able to be moved,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2451
01:49:15.951 --> 01:49:20.951
<v Speaker 2>it needs to have commissions and medical</v>
<v Speaker 2>professionals that can adjust and adapt </v>

2452
01:49:20.951 --> 01:49:21.810
<v Speaker 2>to what's happening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2453
01:49:21.860 --> 01:49:23.390
<v Speaker 2>with the growth of science,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2454
01:49:23.391 --> 01:49:26.060
<v Speaker 2>like there's a reason why we're breaking</v>
<v Speaker 2>records every Olympics.</v>

2455
01:49:26.150 --> 01:49:27.390
<v Speaker 2>We're getting better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2456
01:49:27.400 --> 01:49:29.900
<v Speaker 2>like with the human body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how to make it perform better.</v>

2457
01:49:30.320 --> 01:49:33.440
<v Speaker 2>I'm having people that are smarter than </v>
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>

2458
01:49:33.470 --> 01:49:38.470
<v Speaker 2>like figure out where those lines are </v>
<v Speaker 2>and move them so that you don't have to </v>

2459
01:49:38.470 --> 01:49:38.990
<v Speaker 2>get that line,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has to be there,</v>

2460
01:49:39.050 --> 01:49:39.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2461
01:49:40.080 --> 01:49:42.170
<v Speaker 2>it can be a mobile line that they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they move,</v>

2462
01:49:42.200 --> 01:49:43.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from year to year.</v>

2463
01:49:43.071 --> 01:49:46.280
<v Speaker 2>But that line has to be there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when guys step across it,</v>

2464
01:49:46.750 --> 01:49:48.070
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2465
01:49:48.100 --> 01:49:49.570
<v Speaker 2>there has to be recut repercussions.</v>

2466
01:49:49.910 --> 01:49:53.870
<v Speaker 1>My concern is what's really going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen in the future,</v>

2467
01:49:53.871 --> 01:49:57.440
<v Speaker 1>which happens with almost anything that </v>
<v Speaker 1>involves human innovation.</v>

2468
01:49:57.620 --> 01:50:02.620
<v Speaker 1>Like if you look back at the cell phones</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the 19 nineties where they had these </v>

2469
01:50:02.620 --> 01:50:06.071
<v Speaker 1>fucking giant bricks and they'd hold </v>
<v Speaker 1>them up to the head and have videos and </v>

2470
01:50:06.071 --> 01:50:08.150
<v Speaker 1>now you can go anywhere in the world in </v>
<v Speaker 1>a third world country,</v>

2471
01:50:08.151 --> 01:50:11.240
<v Speaker 1>in a impoverished neighborhood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and people have these really small,</v>

2472
01:50:11.630 --> 01:50:16.630
<v Speaker 1>incredibly complex cell phones that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>just these magical devices that allow </v>

2473
01:50:16.630 --> 01:50:19.490
<v Speaker 1>you to interface with the entire </v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge base of the world and they're.</v>

2474
01:50:19.520 --> 01:50:23.510
<v Speaker 1>They're everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder what's going to happen when you</v>

2475
01:50:23.511 --> 01:50:26.180
<v Speaker 1>have the kind of technology that they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>working on right now,</v>

2476
01:50:26.181 --> 01:50:31.181
<v Speaker 1>genetic engineering at a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at a cellular level where they're able </v>

2477
01:50:31.181 --> 01:50:31.310
<v Speaker 1>to change people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2478
01:50:31.311 --> 01:50:36.311
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you're aware of the mild stat </v>
<v Speaker 1>inhibitors like these things that they </v>

2479
01:50:36.311 --> 01:50:36.311
<v Speaker 1>use with.</v>

2480
01:50:36.311 --> 01:50:37.940
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've demonstrated in whippets.</v>

2481
01:50:38.120 --> 01:50:41.180
<v Speaker 1>These dogs were just because of </v>
<v Speaker 1>breeding.</v>

2482
01:50:41.420 --> 01:50:46.420
<v Speaker 1>Just a just a mistake and breeding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've produced these super hyper </v>

2483
01:50:46.420 --> 01:50:49.610
<v Speaker 1>muscular dogs that have double the </v>
<v Speaker 1>muscle in cows as well.</v>

2484
01:50:49.611 --> 01:50:51.590
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever seen those images?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's incredible,</v>

2485
01:50:51.591 --> 01:50:52.610
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2486
01:50:52.670 --> 01:50:57.670
<v Speaker 1>people are being born just born with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A kid in Germany was born just a genetic</v>

2487
01:50:57.681 --> 01:50:59.930
<v Speaker 1>mistake or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or a benefit to him.</v>

2488
01:51:00.320 --> 01:51:01.790
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're gonna be able to figure that out</v>

2489
01:51:01.791 --> 01:51:05.530
<v Speaker 1>with a pill or the shot and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking mailman is going to have it.</v>

2490
01:51:05.540 --> 01:51:07.250
<v Speaker 1>Your mailman is gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look like the hulk.</v>

2491
01:51:07.730 --> 01:51:10.490
<v Speaker 1>And when that happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it's everywhere,</v>

2492
01:51:10.670 --> 01:51:12.170
<v Speaker 1>what is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do we do with athletes?</v>

2493
01:51:12.770 --> 01:51:16.360
<v Speaker 2>Have the Germans were trying it with </v>
<v Speaker 2>your genetics.</v>

2494
01:51:16.361 --> 01:51:21.361
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we've done it periodically </v>

2495
01:51:21.361 --> 01:51:21.361
<v Speaker 2>throughout history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The spartans did it,</v>

2496
01:51:21.361 --> 01:51:21.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they did it at spartans do.</v>

2497
01:51:21.760 --> 01:51:24.940
<v Speaker 2>They'd throw babies that didn't meet </v>
<v Speaker 2>their requirements off the cliff.</v>

2498
01:51:26.640 --> 01:51:31.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This huge genetics at a very primal </v>

2499
01:51:31.640 --> 01:51:33.490
<v Speaker 2>level of it happens in nature all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>time where a mom will be like,</v>

2500
01:51:34.090 --> 01:51:36.490
<v Speaker 2>this cup is not gonna be able to walk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm leaving it,</v>

2501
01:51:37.540 --> 01:51:38.330
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like,</v>

2502
01:51:38.380 --> 01:51:40.150
<v Speaker 2>that's your genetics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's survival of the fittest.</v>

2503
01:51:40.990 --> 01:51:43.990
<v Speaker 2>Now we as super too smart for our own </v>
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>

2504
01:51:43.991 --> 01:51:48.991
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes humans can take huge genetics </v>
<v Speaker 2>and fix it with chemistry.</v>

2505
01:51:50.230 --> 01:51:51.660
<v Speaker 2>That's scary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2506
01:51:51.820 --> 01:51:54.720
<v Speaker 2>where we can just magically pop out like</v>
<v Speaker 2>superhuman.</v>

2507
01:51:54.770 --> 01:51:56.380
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if I'm ready for that.</v>

2508
01:51:57.050 --> 01:52:00.440
<v Speaker 1>I don't know anyone's ready for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>implications of what that means morally.</v>

2509
01:52:00.500 --> 01:52:05.500
<v Speaker 1>If we don't get hit by an asteroid or </v>
<v Speaker 1>invaded by aliens or blow each other up </v>

2510
01:52:05.500 --> 01:52:06.060
<v Speaker 1>with nukes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's common there.</v>

2511
01:52:06.240 --> 01:52:11.240
<v Speaker 1>They're not going to stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's egg heads that are in </v>

2512
01:52:11.240 --> 01:52:14.081
<v Speaker 1>laboratories right now that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>constantly working on new shit and </v>

2513
01:52:14.081 --> 01:52:15.500
<v Speaker 1>that's what they do and that's what </v>
<v Speaker 1>humans do.</v>

2514
01:52:15.680 --> 01:52:18.020
<v Speaker 1>We push the boundaries of innovation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We always have.</v>

2515
01:52:18.021 --> 01:52:23.021
<v Speaker 1>It's part of what makes us human.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's why we're on a podcast right now </v>

2516
01:52:23.021 --> 01:52:24.290
<v Speaker 1>talking to a microphone that neither you</v>
<v Speaker 1>nor I could have ever figured out on her</v>

2517
01:52:24.291 --> 01:52:29.291
<v Speaker 1>own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a part of the program and </v>

2518
01:52:29.291 --> 01:52:29.291
<v Speaker 1>they're going to figure out something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

<v Speaker 1>bots or some sort of a new chemical that</v>

<v Speaker 1>reengineering the human mind.</v>

2524
01:52:44.310 --> 01:52:48.170
<v Speaker 1>This is going to be a of crazy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might not be in our lifetimes,</v>

2525
01:52:48.320 --> 01:52:53.320

<v Speaker 1>going to experience human beings that no</v>
<v Speaker 1>one has ever experienced in the entire </v>

2527
01:52:55.991 --> 01:52:57.470
<v Speaker 1>history of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the world itself.</v>

2528
01:52:58.430 --> 01:53:00.830
<v Speaker 1>It's coming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's coming by human innovation.</v>

2529
01:53:01.070 --> 01:53:02.750
<v Speaker 1>It's gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>leapfrog,</v>

2530
01:53:03.020 --> 01:53:03.500
<v Speaker 1>evolution.</v>

2531
01:53:03.520 --> 01:53:08.520
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure I want to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to kind of sad that I'm going </v>

2532
01:53:08.520 --> 01:53:09.250
<v Speaker 2>to miss it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I want to reap the benefits of it,</v>

2533
01:53:09.251 --> 01:53:11.890
<v Speaker 2>but then at the flip,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to have to deal with,</v>

2534
01:53:12.620 --> 01:53:13.380
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>the implications of that.</v>

2536
01:53:16.330 --> 01:53:19.600
<v Speaker 1>I'm sad that I'm going to miss it too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or we might not miss it.</v>

2537
01:53:19.601 --> 01:53:23.140
<v Speaker 1>We might just catch the wave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm also,</v>

2538
01:53:23.290 --> 01:53:27.190
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad that I saw the world before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of shit was.</v>

2539
01:53:27.191 --> 01:53:30.400
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my kids are gonna grow up in a world.</v>

2540
01:53:30.410 --> 01:53:35.410
<v Speaker 1>I have a 17 year old and she doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>have any idea what life was like before </v>

2541
01:53:35.410 --> 01:53:35.800
<v Speaker 1>the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She has no idea.</v>

2542
01:53:36.010 --> 01:53:37.660
<v Speaker 1>The Internet is always been there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She has a question.</v>

2543
01:53:38.260 --> 01:53:38.950
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's the answer.</v>

2544
01:53:39.460 --> 01:53:44.460
<v Speaker 1>I grew up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was retarded when I was her age and I </v>

2545
01:53:44.460 --> 01:53:44.460
<v Speaker 1>put it in her head every day I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me tell you,</v>

2546
01:53:44.460 --> 01:53:47.230
<v Speaker 1>if you met me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I was 17 and you were 17,</v>

2547
01:53:47.231 --> 01:53:48.160
<v Speaker 1>you would think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

2548
01:53:48.161 --> 01:53:50.920
<v Speaker 1>this is the dumbest fucking guy that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever walked the face of the earth,</v>

2549
01:53:51.130 --> 01:53:53.620
<v Speaker 1>and he thinks he's so smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was an idiot.</v>

2550
01:53:53.920 --> 01:53:58.920
<v Speaker 1>I knew how to throw kicks and I knew </v>
<v Speaker 1>which Stephen King books I liked.</v>

2551
01:53:59.050 --> 01:54:04.050
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew what the right combination of </v>

2552
01:54:04.050 --> 01:54:04.570
<v Speaker 1>words to say to get a girl to fuck me </v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes.</v>

2553
01:54:04.780 --> 01:54:05.890
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all I knew.</v>

2554
01:54:05.891 --> 01:54:10.891
<v Speaker 1>I was a moron.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what a 17 year old knows today as </v>

2555
01:54:10.891 --> 01:54:14.461
<v Speaker 1>opposed to what they knew when I was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the future is going to be even </v>

2556
01:54:14.461 --> 01:54:16.990
<v Speaker 1>crazier than that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at least I got a perspective.</v>

2557
01:54:17.020 --> 01:54:22.020
<v Speaker 1>I got to see what it was like to grow up</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you didn't know if you called </v>

2558
01:54:22.020 --> 01:54:24.550
<v Speaker 1>someone and they weren't home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just weren't fucking home.</v>

2559
01:54:24.940 --> 01:54:29.940
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember when answering machines were </v>

2560
01:54:29.940 --> 01:54:30.310
<v Speaker 1>invented where people were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit</v>

2633
01:57:33.480 --> 01:57:38.480
<v Speaker 2>never in our history in May kinds </v>
<v Speaker 2>existence have we been able to connect </v>

2634
01:57:38.480 --> 01:57:40.380
<v Speaker 2>so effortlessly to so many different </v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

2635
01:57:40.760 --> 01:57:41.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2636
01:57:41.420 --> 01:57:46.420
<v Speaker 2>like a fan that doesn't like me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can just get on twitter and like </v>

2637
01:57:46.420 --> 01:57:47.460
<v Speaker 2>tell me that I'm a baby killer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like just because,</v>

2638
01:57:47.461 --> 01:57:49.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or they can do anything anytime,</v>

2639
01:57:49.861 --> 01:57:51.720
<v Speaker 2>anywhere and they can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2640
01:57:51.721 --> 01:57:56.721
<v Speaker 2>like you can find out anything about </v>
<v Speaker 2>anybody and then probably breached that </v>

2641
01:57:56.721 --> 01:57:56.721
<v Speaker 2>person,</v>

2642
01:57:56.721 --> 01:58:00.520
<v Speaker 3>especially a fighter or someone who's </v>
<v Speaker 3>got a social media account or a </v>

2643
01:58:00.520 --> 01:58:00.650
<v Speaker 3>president of a social media account.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2644
01:58:00.651 --> 01:58:04.300
<v Speaker 3>like there's a few folks that I know </v>
<v Speaker 3>that just avoid it all together,</v>

2645
01:58:04.301 --> 01:58:05.620
<v Speaker 3>but they don't have to do it.</v>

2646
01:58:06.370 --> 01:58:09.190
<v Speaker 2>50 million people here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like almost all of them,</v>

2647
01:58:09.280 --> 01:58:10.060
<v Speaker 2>like $300</v>

2648
01:58:10.120 --> 01:58:12.030
<v Speaker 3>and Mexicans,</v>
<v Speaker 3>14 account Mexicans.</v>

2649
01:58:12.031 --> 01:58:14.620
<v Speaker 3>It's probably another 50 million a </v>
<v Speaker 3>lease.</v>

2650
01:58:14.710 --> 01:58:15.910
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who knows how many.</v>

2651
01:58:16.510 --> 01:58:18.190
<v Speaker 3>I love Mexicans,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't get me wrong,</v>

2652
01:58:18.580 --> 01:58:21.280
<v Speaker 3>but there's a lot of them that aren't </v>
<v Speaker 3>taking the census.</v>

2653
01:58:22.320 --> 01:58:27.320
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how often do you get fucked with on </v>

2654
01:58:27.320 --> 01:58:27.320
<v Speaker 3>social media?</v>
<v Speaker 3>All the time.</v>

2655
01:58:27.320 --> 01:58:27.320
<v Speaker 3>All the time</v>

2656
01:58:27.320 --> 01:58:29.040
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess I'm like a polarizing figure.</v>

2657
01:58:29.100 --> 01:58:31.470
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how I think I'm a likable </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy,</v>

2658
01:58:31.830 --> 01:58:33.150
<v Speaker 2>but some for some reason</v>

2659
01:58:33.290 --> 01:58:36.950
<v Speaker 3>people have a problem with strength.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People have a problem with competence.</v>

2660
01:58:37.280 --> 01:58:42.280
<v Speaker 3>People have a problem with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with folks that have strong opinions or </v>

2661
01:58:42.280 --> 01:58:42.280
<v Speaker 3>controversial opinions,</v>

2662
01:58:42.280 --> 01:58:43.930
<v Speaker 1>and instead of those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2663
01:58:43.990 --> 01:58:44.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should.</v>

2664
01:58:45.550 --> 01:58:50.550
<v Speaker 1>I think anybody who's paying attention </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the world and sees all the </v>

2665
01:58:50.550 --> 01:58:52.540
<v Speaker 1>contradictory information that we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>receiving,</v>

2666
01:58:52.541 --> 01:58:53.970
<v Speaker 1>sees the chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sees,</v>

2667
01:58:54.460 --> 01:58:57.610
<v Speaker 1>just sees how fucked our political </v>
<v Speaker 1>system is.</v>

2668
01:58:57.611 --> 01:59:00.640
<v Speaker 1>Our financial system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you don't have strong opinions,</v>

2669
01:59:00.940 --> 01:59:02.710
<v Speaker 1>if you don't have controversial </v>
<v Speaker 1>opinions,</v>

2670
01:59:02.820 --> 01:59:05.140
<v Speaker 1>you're not paying attention to your </v>
<v Speaker 1>eyes.</v>

2671
01:59:05.460 --> 01:59:06.450
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2672
01:59:06.460 --> 01:59:11.460
<v Speaker 1>I can't tell you how many conversations </v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had about gun control just about </v>

2673
01:59:12.011 --> 01:59:13.360
<v Speaker 1>guns itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2674
01:59:13.361 --> 01:59:15.490
<v Speaker 1>God damn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>guns aren't the problem.</v>

2675
01:59:15.491 --> 01:59:18.130
<v Speaker 1>It's people that use guns that are the </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>

2676
01:59:18.310 --> 01:59:18.940
<v Speaker 1>You leave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2677
01:59:19.050 --> 01:59:20.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that old adage,</v>

2678
01:59:20.800 --> 01:59:25.800
<v Speaker 1>guns don't kill people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People kill people and people will </v>

2679
01:59:25.800 --> 01:59:25.800
<v Speaker 1>fucking argue that to the end of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God dammit.</v>

2680
01:59:25.800 --> 01:59:27.370
<v Speaker 1>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every time you go to the gas station,</v>

2681
01:59:27.520 --> 01:59:30.370
<v Speaker 1>you got a store in that gas station that</v>
<v Speaker 1>sells the lighters.</v>

2682
01:59:30.580 --> 01:59:35.580
<v Speaker 1>You got fluid that comes out of a pump </v>
<v Speaker 1>and anyone can just light people on </v>

2683
01:59:36.131 --> 01:59:37.670
<v Speaker 1>fire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's it.</v>

2684
01:59:37.780 --> 01:59:40.090
<v Speaker 1>Anyone can do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It hasn't happened that often,</v>

2685
01:59:40.240 --> 01:59:41.410
<v Speaker 1>but anyone can do it.</v>

2686
01:59:41.410 --> 01:59:46.410
<v Speaker 2>Or just take your car and turn two </v>
<v Speaker 2>degrees to the right and run down the </v>

2687
01:59:46.410 --> 01:59:46.410
<v Speaker 2>sidewalk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2688
01:59:46.710 --> 01:59:49.210
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the option to kill is always there.</v>

2689
01:59:49.330 --> 01:59:50.680
<v Speaker 2>It's always there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a choice,</v>

2690
01:59:51.200 --> 01:59:51.790
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're like,</v>

2691
01:59:51.791 --> 01:59:56.791
<v Speaker 2>but it's a tool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a mechanism that serves no other </v>

2692
01:59:56.791 --> 01:59:56.791
<v Speaker 2>purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2693
01:59:56.791 --> 01:59:56.791
<v Speaker 2>a car can get you from point a to point </v>
<v Speaker 2>b.</v>

2694
01:59:56.791 --> 02:00:00.350
<v Speaker 2>So why do they need a gun with him?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only thing it does is kill you.</v>

2695
02:00:00.410 --> 02:00:03.820
<v Speaker 2>Like I could say the same thing about a </v>
<v Speaker 2>tractor.</v>

2696
02:00:03.821 --> 02:00:08.821
<v Speaker 2>If I wanted to know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if I wanted to make a killer </v>

2697
02:00:08.821 --> 02:00:08.821
<v Speaker 2>tractor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the only thing that's designed for us to</v>

2698
02:00:08.821 --> 02:00:10.030
<v Speaker 2>kill because I put spikes on its wheels,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2699
02:00:10.031 --> 02:00:15.031
<v Speaker 2>and it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't excavate anything besides human </v>

2700
02:00:15.031 --> 02:00:15.430
<v Speaker 2>souls,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but no,</v>

2701
02:00:15.660 --> 02:00:17.280
<v Speaker 2>it's the choice to kill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2702
02:00:17.320 --> 02:00:19.540
<v Speaker 2>it's like get over it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get people killed</v>

2703
02:00:19.710 --> 02:00:24.660
<v Speaker 1>it is is a way that they can do it </v>
<v Speaker 1>easily and that is an issue,</v>

2704
02:00:25.050 --> 02:00:25.410
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

2705
02:00:26.410 --> 02:00:31.410
<v Speaker 1>it's also why does a person have the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ability to do that and how come so </v>

2706
02:00:32.471 --> 02:00:37.471
<v Speaker 1>little effort and so little emphasis is </v>
<v Speaker 1>on what causes a person to be able to </v>

2707
02:00:37.511 --> 02:00:42.511
<v Speaker 1>disconnect or to be able to have so much</v>
<v Speaker 1>hate and anger in their heart that they </v>

2708
02:00:42.511 --> 02:00:45.871
<v Speaker 1>can kill a bunch of school children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they can use a gun to shoot up a </v>

2709
02:00:45.871 --> 02:00:46.460
<v Speaker 1>mall like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

2710
02:00:46.500 --> 02:00:51.500
<v Speaker 1>why isn't that the subject of discussion</v>
<v Speaker 1>and why is it always the tool for </v>

2711
02:00:51.500 --> 02:00:56.191
<v Speaker 1>madness?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not the madness itself is the tool </v>

2712
02:00:56.191 --> 02:00:57.490
<v Speaker 1>of madness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that same tool can be used by anyone</v>

2713
02:00:57.491 --> 02:01:01.090
<v Speaker 1>else to do a million other things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's a bad analogy,</v>

2714
02:01:01.091 --> 02:01:02.620
<v Speaker 1>but it's one that I always use with </v>
<v Speaker 1>marijuana.</v>

2715
02:01:02.621 --> 02:01:03.130
<v Speaker 1>People go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2716
02:01:03.131 --> 02:01:04.750
<v Speaker 1>you could ruin your life if you smoke </v>
<v Speaker 1>pot.</v>

2717
02:01:05.260 --> 02:01:10.260
<v Speaker 1>You could.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could also take a hammer and hit </v>

2718
02:01:10.260 --> 02:01:10.930
<v Speaker 1>yourself in the Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2719
02:01:10.960 --> 02:01:12.910
<v Speaker 1>should.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Should we make hammers illegal?</v>

2720
02:01:12.911 --> 02:01:14.710
<v Speaker 1>Because you can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because the hammer is just a tool.</v>

2721
02:01:15.220 --> 02:01:19.780
<v Speaker 1>If you take marijuana and just enjoy it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you don't hurt anybody,</v>

2722
02:01:20.020 --> 02:01:25.020
<v Speaker 1>should that person be penalized because </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone decided to just wake and bake </v>

2723
02:01:25.020 --> 02:01:26.950
<v Speaker 1>every day and then fucking go into debt </v>
<v Speaker 1>and wind up.</v>

2724
02:01:27.310 --> 02:01:32.310
<v Speaker 1>It's humans are the problem in human </v>
<v Speaker 1>weakness and a lack of character and all</v>

2725
02:01:34.331 --> 02:01:35.740
<v Speaker 1>sorts of chemical imbalances</v>

2726
02:01:35.910 --> 02:01:40.910
<v Speaker 2>or the culture and the structure around </v>
<v Speaker 2>the person that led them to make these </v>

2727
02:01:41.001 --> 02:01:44.300
<v Speaker 2>horrific decisions and actions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2728
02:01:44.420 --> 02:01:47.060
<v Speaker 2>that they use whatever tool,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't care what it is,</v>

2729
02:01:47.330 --> 02:01:52.330
<v Speaker 2>gun knife,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything up to that point is what we </v>

2730
02:01:52.330 --> 02:01:55.361
<v Speaker 2>should.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The emphasis of trying to understand or </v>

2731
02:01:55.361 --> 02:01:55.760
<v Speaker 2>prevent an acknowledged and research </v>
<v Speaker 2>should be done,</v>

2732
02:01:55.761 --> 02:01:57.440
<v Speaker 2>not take away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2733
02:01:58.580 --> 02:02:01.070
<v Speaker 2>whatever it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was the end conclusion.</v>

2734
02:02:01.100 --> 02:02:06.100
<v Speaker 2>It's all the things up to that point </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's that are important that nobody </v>

2735
02:02:06.100 --> 02:02:06.100
<v Speaker 2>pays attention to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody cares about.</v>

2736
02:02:06.100 --> 02:02:09.540
<v Speaker 1>That's what was ridiculous about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Any sort of control,</v>

2737
02:02:09.600 --> 02:02:11.730
<v Speaker 1>gun control,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knife control,</v>

2738
02:02:11.731 --> 02:02:14.850
<v Speaker 1>bow and Arrow control debate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not that.</v>

2739
02:02:14.880 --> 02:02:19.880
<v Speaker 1>It's what constitutes what went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what makes a human being capable of </v>

2740
02:02:19.880 --> 02:02:24.621
<v Speaker 1>horrific things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think you're uniquely qualified </v>

2741
02:02:24.621 --> 02:02:24.621
<v Speaker 1>for a bunch of reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>

2742
02:02:24.621 --> 02:02:28.731
<v Speaker 1>because you have a family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what it's like to raise a </v>

2743
02:02:28.731 --> 02:02:31.131
<v Speaker 1>person and to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've seen the consequences of human </v>

2744
02:02:31.131 --> 02:02:35.781
<v Speaker 1>beings when they're in this environment </v>
<v Speaker 1>that is totally fucked from from the </v>

2745
02:02:37.021 --> 02:02:40.530
<v Speaker 1>jump and you see these religious </v>
<v Speaker 1>fanatics and you see fundamentalism,</v>

2746
02:02:40.531 --> 02:02:45.531
<v Speaker 1>you see chaos and a land that's just </v>
<v Speaker 1>just overrun with it.</v>

2747
02:02:45.930 --> 02:02:47.460
<v Speaker 1>You see it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's humans.</v>

2748
02:02:47.520 --> 02:02:49.440
<v Speaker 1>It's the development of humans</v>

2749
02:02:49.800 --> 02:02:53.520
<v Speaker 2>and an error.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They use the development erroneously,</v>

2750
02:02:53.521 --> 02:02:55.710
<v Speaker 2>like the development of human,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the wrong way.</v>

2751
02:02:56.060 --> 02:02:59.400
<v Speaker 2>There's the right way and there's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's the right way.</v>

2752
02:02:59.401 --> 02:03:02.090
<v Speaker 2>There's about a billion right ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2753
02:03:02.100 --> 02:03:03.810
<v Speaker 2>there's a couple of wrong ways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2754
02:03:03.811 --> 02:03:07.140
<v Speaker 2>in a couple of wrong ways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>end up with bad products</v>

2755
02:03:07.420 --> 02:03:12.420
<v Speaker 1>and it's again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of contradictory thing that </v>

2756
02:03:12.420 --> 02:03:14.740
<v Speaker 1>through through combat and through,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially through martial arts,</v>

2757
02:03:14.741 --> 02:03:19.741
<v Speaker 1>I think that the deepest bond of </v>
<v Speaker 1>commitment that I've ever experienced </v>

2758
02:03:19.741 --> 02:03:23.890
<v Speaker 1>was outside of my family is the friends </v>
<v Speaker 1>that have trained with and people that </v>

2759
02:03:23.890 --> 02:03:26.320
<v Speaker 1>have competed with that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that have just.</v>

2760
02:03:26.650 --> 02:03:28.990
<v Speaker 1>You see them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know who the fuck they are.</v>

2761
02:03:29.170 --> 02:03:33.160
<v Speaker 1>When you see a guy breaking training,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you see a guy with 30 seconds to go</v>

2762
02:03:33.161 --> 02:03:36.310
<v Speaker 1>in the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put his hands down on his knees and just</v>

2763
02:03:36.580 --> 02:03:41.580
<v Speaker 1>take deep breaths and step away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you see the coach go get back </v>

2764
02:03:41.580 --> 02:03:42.730
<v Speaker 1>in there and you see them suck it up and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2765
02:03:42.731 --> 02:03:47.731
<v Speaker 1>there's the guys who would suck it up </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's guys who don't and you see the </v>

2766
02:03:47.731 --> 02:03:47.731
<v Speaker 1>difference,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see who they are,</v>

2767
02:03:47.731 --> 02:03:48.820
<v Speaker 1>you see their soul,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see,</v>

2768
02:03:49.120 --> 02:03:52.570
<v Speaker 1>and you learn about people that way in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>way that a lot of folks don't ever get a</v>

2769
02:03:52.571 --> 02:03:55.120
<v Speaker 1>chance to learn even about themselves.</v>

2770
02:03:55.440 --> 02:04:00.440
<v Speaker 2>The refiner fire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the refiner's fire is like this </v>

2771
02:04:00.440 --> 02:04:00.440
<v Speaker 2>beautiful thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2772
02:04:00.440 --> 02:04:02.350
<v Speaker 2>it's a refiner's fire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Refiner's fire.</v>

2773
02:04:02.351 --> 02:04:05.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So get you take a metal refineries.</v>

2774
02:04:05.081 --> 02:04:05.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2775
02:04:05.651 --> 02:04:07.300
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you're making a sword,</v>

2776
02:04:07.570 --> 02:04:08.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2777
02:04:08.370 --> 02:04:13.370
<v Speaker 2>the folding process of heating it up and</v>
<v Speaker 2>pounding out the impurities and 14 and </v>

2778
02:04:13.370 --> 02:04:13.370
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and pounding out the impurities.</v>

2779
02:04:13.370 --> 02:04:16.030
<v Speaker 2>Impurities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the hotter the fire,</v>

2780
02:04:16.060 --> 02:04:19.090
<v Speaker 2>the more bad stuff gets cooked out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2781
02:04:19.420 --> 02:04:20.710
<v Speaker 2>that's the same with people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2782
02:04:20.711 --> 02:04:24.490
<v Speaker 2>you put them in a room that's hot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put them in a Ge that's hot.</v>

2783
02:04:24.850 --> 02:04:28.570
<v Speaker 2>I'm around a whole bunch of other dudes </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are like trying to choke each other</v>

2784
02:04:28.571 --> 02:04:33.571
<v Speaker 2>out and kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get glimpses of the depth and </v>

2785
02:04:33.571 --> 02:04:36.901
<v Speaker 2>hardness of somebody's character and </v>
<v Speaker 2>soul and see awesome snapshots and even </v>

2786
02:04:37.231 --> 02:04:42.231
<v Speaker 2>kids like down at the youngest level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>putting them into competitions of </v>

2787
02:04:42.231 --> 02:04:42.240
<v Speaker 2>martial arts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see the exact same thing.</v>

2788
02:04:42.241 --> 02:04:45.930
<v Speaker 2>You see the development of this </v>
<v Speaker 2>character and if somebody's soul,</v>

2789
02:04:45.931 --> 02:04:50.040
<v Speaker 2>as they get tougher and deeper,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2790
02:04:50.041 --> 02:04:51.180
<v Speaker 2>as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a human,</v>

2791
02:04:51.190 --> 02:04:56.190
<v Speaker 2>and you get in indy snapshots,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get a clear glimpse of who that </v>

2792
02:04:56.190 --> 02:04:56.370
<v Speaker 2>person is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's,</v>

2793
02:04:56.400 --> 02:04:57.690
<v Speaker 2>what's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's part of them.</v>

2794
02:04:57.890 --> 02:04:59.260
<v Speaker 2>Like it's cool,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's cool.</v>

2795
02:04:59.430 --> 02:05:01.200
<v Speaker 1>Strong Gracie said it best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

2796
02:05:01.201 --> 02:05:01.890
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2797
02:05:02.130 --> 02:05:02.990
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2798
02:05:02.991 --> 02:05:06.480
<v Speaker 1>I reserve judgment until I've trained </v>
<v Speaker 1>with you.</v>

2799
02:05:06.760 --> 02:05:10.050
<v Speaker 1>Now he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you know me.</v>

2800
02:05:10.051 --> 02:05:11.280
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you seem like a nice guy,</v>

2801
02:05:11.281 --> 02:05:13.440
<v Speaker 1>but I reserve judgment until I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>trained with you,</v>

2802
02:05:13.650 --> 02:05:16.950
<v Speaker 1>which is such a great way to put it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

2803
02:05:16.951 --> 02:05:19.130
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people think we're cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want a fucking train.</v>

2804
02:05:19.190 --> 02:05:24.190
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not that it's just you should in </v>

2805
02:05:24.190 --> 02:05:25.800
<v Speaker 1>your life do something difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is not martial arts.</v>

2806
02:05:26.040 --> 02:05:28.560
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's mountain climbing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's hiking.</v>

2807
02:05:28.561 --> 02:05:30.580
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I'd run anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't matter.</v>

2808
02:05:30.630 --> 02:05:33.450
<v Speaker 1>Do something that's hard to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's write a book.</v>

2809
02:05:33.451 --> 02:05:38.370
<v Speaker 1>Find out what your fucking barriers are </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the most reprehensible thing,</v>

2810
02:05:38.371 --> 02:05:43.371
<v Speaker 1>the thing that we all pretty much </v>
<v Speaker 1>universally despised is a spoiled rich </v>

2811
02:05:43.371 --> 02:05:44.850
<v Speaker 1>kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a spoiled kid that never had to work for</v>

2812
02:05:44.851 --> 02:05:45.210
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

2813
02:05:45.210 --> 02:05:48.360
<v Speaker 1>They were handed at their whole life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their parents never gave them values,</v>

2814
02:05:48.540 --> 02:05:53.540
<v Speaker 1>and what did they do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They grow up yelling at servants and </v>

2815
02:05:53.540 --> 02:05:54.230
<v Speaker 1>then they become some rich asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a sociopath.</v>

2816
02:05:54.400 --> 02:05:56.060
<v Speaker 1>I mean that is the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>

2817
02:05:56.230 --> 02:06:00.570
<v Speaker 1>That's a key character in so many movies</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's in so many books,</v>

2818
02:06:00.571 --> 02:06:05.571
<v Speaker 1>literature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we all can relate to that person who </v>

2819
02:06:05.571 --> 02:06:06.540
<v Speaker 1>didn't earn it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who got that place without hard work and</v>

2820
02:06:06.541 --> 02:06:08.460
<v Speaker 1>how gross they are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hate that pussy.</v>

2821
02:06:08.860 --> 02:06:10.580
<v Speaker 1>Fucking everybody does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're supposed to.</v>

2822
02:06:11.370 --> 02:06:13.120
<v Speaker 1>It's supposed to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not supposed to be there.</v>

2823
02:06:13.121 --> 02:06:18.121
<v Speaker 1>It's not supposed to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not supposed to win the lottery </v>

2824
02:06:18.121 --> 02:06:18.121
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That fucks you up.</v>

2825
02:06:18.121 --> 02:06:22.410
<v Speaker 2>But the really remarkable ones that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>the ones that could or have access to </v>

2826
02:06:22.991 --> 02:06:26.800
<v Speaker 2>all of that and then choose not to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or on the total flip side,</v>

2827
02:06:26.830 --> 02:06:31.830
<v Speaker 2>the guys that have access to none of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that and challenge themselves and put </v>

2828
02:06:31.931 --> 02:06:33.940
<v Speaker 2>themselves through hardships that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>altos,</v>

2829
02:06:34.300 --> 02:06:36.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that like they have nothing.</v>

2830
02:06:36.580 --> 02:06:38.230
<v Speaker 2>And just through hard work </v>
<v Speaker 2>determination,</v>

2831
02:06:38.800 --> 02:06:40.750
<v Speaker 2>they become something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2832
02:06:40.810 --> 02:06:44.830
<v Speaker 2>like those are two complete polar </v>
<v Speaker 2>opposites of a human that I just like,</v>

2833
02:06:44.860 --> 02:06:45.880
<v Speaker 2>I adore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2834
02:06:45.881 --> 02:06:48.910
<v Speaker 2>like I said in the military,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see these guys are like,</v>

2835
02:06:49.490 --> 02:06:53.890
<v Speaker 2>you were like this Ivy League,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Super Rich,</v>

2836
02:06:54.070 --> 02:06:56.740
<v Speaker 2>you're enlisted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why are you here?</v>

2837
02:06:56.830 --> 02:06:58.240
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could have done anything.</v>

2838
02:06:58.260 --> 02:07:00.030
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to be here.</v>

2839
02:07:00.031 --> 02:07:01.450
<v Speaker 2>Like I love you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're amazing.</v>

2840
02:07:01.690 --> 02:07:03.220
<v Speaker 2>You know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then then the flip side,</v>

2841
02:07:03.230 --> 02:07:03.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2842
02:07:03.660 --> 02:07:08.660
<v Speaker 2>the Puerto Rican that his parents swam </v>
<v Speaker 2>over here or on some pourable boat and </v>

2843
02:07:09.941 --> 02:07:10.670
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2844
02:07:10.730 --> 02:07:15.730
<v Speaker 2>they're one generation removed and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>have like they put themselves through </v>

2845
02:07:15.730 --> 02:07:17.080
<v Speaker 2>college or maybe they joined the </v>
<v Speaker 2>military so they could go to college and</v>

2846
02:07:17.200 --> 02:07:22.200
<v Speaker 2>their ethics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this exact same point of their life as </v>

2847
02:07:22.200 --> 02:07:25.161
<v Speaker 2>this rich Yuppie guy that are just there</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they want to see how hard they </v>

2848
02:07:25.870 --> 02:07:27.490
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how far they can push themselves.</v>

2849
02:07:27.930 --> 02:07:29.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Humans beings are just,</v>

2850
02:07:29.910 --> 02:07:34.910
<v Speaker 1>we are just a mass of potential and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>awesome to see someone rise through </v>

2851
02:07:37.150 --> 02:07:40.840
<v Speaker 1>adversity and reach a potential that </v>
<v Speaker 1>elevates us all.</v>

2852
02:07:41.080 --> 02:07:46.080
<v Speaker 1>Because when you see someone reach their</v>
<v Speaker 1>potential or reach out very high level </v>

2853
02:07:46.080 --> 02:07:46.080
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of anything,</v>

2854
02:07:46.240 --> 02:07:48.820
<v Speaker 1>it changes the way you look at what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible.</v>

2855
02:07:48.821 --> 02:07:51.580
<v Speaker 1>When you see a guy who gets up at 6:00</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the morning,</v>

2856
02:07:51.581 --> 02:07:56.581
<v Speaker 1>the alarm clock goes off and he just </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking hits those hills and starts </v>

2857
02:07:56.581 --> 02:07:56.860
<v Speaker 1>running and he does it every morning </v>
<v Speaker 1>before work.</v>

2858
02:07:57.240 --> 02:07:57.970
<v Speaker 1>You Go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

2859
02:07:57.971 --> 02:07:59.680
<v Speaker 1>I'm a bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just a weak bitch.</v>

2860
02:07:59.681 --> 02:08:00.690
<v Speaker 1>I don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>

2861
02:08:00.700 --> 02:08:03.190
<v Speaker 1>And then it changes your perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to do that too.</v>

2862
02:08:03.430 --> 02:08:08.430
<v Speaker 1>You want to absorb a little bit of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy strengthened that feeling that you </v>

2863
02:08:08.430 --> 02:08:11.551
<v Speaker 1>get from being around that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's empowering or you're one of those </v>

2864
02:08:11.551 --> 02:08:15.721
<v Speaker 1>guys that diminishes that and tries to </v>
<v Speaker 1>squash it because you're insecure and </v>

2865
02:08:15.721 --> 02:08:17.740
<v Speaker 1>you wanna you wanna tweet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tim Kennedy,</v>

2866
02:08:17.741 --> 02:08:19.030
<v Speaker 1>you fucking bitch.</v>

2867
02:08:19.030 --> 02:08:22.610
<v Speaker 1>You look you in the mood to you mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know there's,</v>

2868
02:08:22.640 --> 02:08:27.640
<v Speaker 1>there's folks like that too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that strength is the best </v>

2869
02:08:28.930 --> 02:08:33.930
<v Speaker 1>antidote for a lot of the weaknesses </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we find in our society that we </v>

2870
02:08:33.930 --> 02:08:35.170
<v Speaker 1>consider to be strength.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like bullies.</v>

2871
02:08:35.650 --> 02:08:37.720
<v Speaker 1>People say like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the best solution to bullies?</v>

2872
02:08:38.050 --> 02:08:41.050
<v Speaker 1>Teach them how to fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Teach them all how to fight everyone.</v>

2873
02:08:41.200 --> 02:08:46.200
<v Speaker 1>I think that is a core problem with men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Men have a giant fear hanging over their</v>

2874
02:08:47.351 --> 02:08:50.470
<v Speaker 1>head all day long and that is being </v>
<v Speaker 1>dominated by other men.</v>

2875
02:08:50.650 --> 02:08:55.650
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean is what led me to martial arts </v>

2876
02:08:55.650 --> 02:08:57.130
<v Speaker 1>100 percent was I was scared of dudes </v>
<v Speaker 1>kicking my ass.</v>

2877
02:08:57.160 --> 02:08:59.980
<v Speaker 1>So I got into martial arts as a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>young kid because of that.</v>

2878
02:09:00.280 --> 02:09:05.280
<v Speaker 1>And I think that the more kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we had programs in school where we </v>

2879
02:09:05.280 --> 02:09:10.081
<v Speaker 1>taught martial arts to kids in class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would have so few instances of </v>

2880
02:09:10.751 --> 02:09:11.110
<v Speaker 1>bullying.</v>

2881
02:09:11.110 --> 02:09:16.110
<v Speaker 1>I think the dramatic decrease in </v>
<v Speaker 1>bullying and the respect that people </v>

2882
02:09:16.181 --> 02:09:19.840
<v Speaker 1>have for each other would change the </v>
<v Speaker 1>respect that people have for themselves.</v>

2883
02:09:20.050 --> 02:09:23.140
<v Speaker 1>Like a bully cannot respect themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just can't.</v>

2884
02:09:23.440 --> 02:09:25.450
<v Speaker 1>Unless there's some sort of a complete </v>
<v Speaker 1>sociopath.</v>

2885
02:09:25.660 --> 02:09:26.240
<v Speaker 1>You're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

2886
02:09:26.260 --> 02:09:31.260
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to be happy with </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself if you pick on someone smaller </v>

2887
02:09:31.260 --> 02:09:31.260
<v Speaker 1>than you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing it because you're insecure.</v>

2888
02:09:31.260 --> 02:09:35.820
<v Speaker 1>But if you weren't insecure or you were </v>
<v Speaker 1>less insecure or you had some sort of </v>

2889
02:09:35.820 --> 02:09:36.910
<v Speaker 1>sense of personal sovereignty because of</v>
<v Speaker 1>training,</v>

2890
02:09:37.180 --> 02:09:42.180
<v Speaker 1>you would have less of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this inclination to do something shitty </v>

2891
02:09:42.180 --> 02:09:43.390
<v Speaker 1>to someone like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2892
02:09:43.450 --> 02:09:45.190
<v Speaker 1>it'd be cool to see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck him,</v>

2893
02:09:45.191 --> 02:09:50.191
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think martial arts programs should be </v>

2894
02:09:50.191 --> 02:09:51.640
<v Speaker 1>mandatory in school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like they have pes mandatory for.</v>

2895
02:09:51.880 --> 02:09:54.340
<v Speaker 1>For Boys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially martial arts should be.</v>

2896
02:09:54.780 --> 02:09:59.780
<v Speaker 2>And you want to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to see what you want to see </v>

2897
02:09:59.780 --> 02:09:59.780
<v Speaker 2>your kid have discipline,</v>
<v Speaker 2>focus,</v>

2898
02:09:59.780 --> 02:09:59.790
<v Speaker 2>understanding of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right and wrong.</v>

2899
02:10:00.660 --> 02:10:03.420
<v Speaker 2>A little bit of confidence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Restraint,</v>

2900
02:10:04.230 --> 02:10:07.380
<v Speaker 2>martial arts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why you did it.</v>

2901
02:10:07.381 --> 02:10:08.350
<v Speaker 2>So you didn't get beat up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2902
02:10:08.351 --> 02:10:10.350
<v Speaker 2>I did it because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2903
02:10:10.820 --> 02:10:13.080
<v Speaker 2>our second born,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was a crazy middle kid,</v>

2904
02:10:13.081 --> 02:10:18.081
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my dad's like at a very early age like </v>

2905
02:10:18.081 --> 02:10:18.081
<v Speaker 2>you are going to be doing martial arts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2906
02:10:18.880 --> 02:10:23.880
<v Speaker 2>so like I was like nine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I remember saying a bad word on the </v>

2907
02:10:23.880 --> 02:10:23.940
<v Speaker 2>mat and having,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2908
02:10:24.060 --> 02:10:29.060
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my sensei come up with an a scream of </v>

2909
02:10:29.060 --> 02:10:29.060
<v Speaker 2>stick and hit me in the back of the head</v>
<v Speaker 2>and like I'm,</v>

2910
02:10:29.060 --> 02:10:29.580
<v Speaker 2>I missed up and doing stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>

2911
02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:32.010
<v Speaker 2>ah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I said a bad word when I messed</v>

2912
02:10:32.011 --> 02:10:32.980
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then bow,</v>

2913
02:10:33.350 --> 02:10:35.210
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't say that bad word again.</v>

2914
02:10:35.300 --> 02:10:40.300
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but more importantly I was able to </v>

2915
02:10:40.300 --> 02:10:40.490
<v Speaker 2>control myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was the elements,</v>

2916
02:10:40.580 --> 02:10:42.260
<v Speaker 2>the necessary element that I needed.</v>

2917
02:10:42.810 --> 02:10:46.170
<v Speaker 1>And also this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the great feeling of accomplishment that</v>

2918
02:10:46.171 --> 02:10:48.570
<v Speaker 1>you get when you learn that you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>control yourself.</v>

2919
02:10:48.810 --> 02:10:50.700
<v Speaker 1>When you feel yourself improving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your feel,</v>

2920
02:10:50.701 --> 02:10:55.701
<v Speaker 1>your character improving and you have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult situation and you navigate it </v>

2921
02:10:55.701 --> 02:10:56.460
<v Speaker 1>successfully.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>

2922
02:10:56.490 --> 02:11:01.490
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a better person now than I was when </v>

2923
02:11:01.490 --> 02:11:02.970
<v Speaker 1>I was whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was young and stupid.</v>

2924
02:11:03.420 --> 02:11:06.840
<v Speaker 1>And that's just one of those things </v>
<v Speaker 1>where everybody wants to be comfortable.</v>

2925
02:11:06.930 --> 02:11:10.290
<v Speaker 1>Everybody wants to look towards their </v>
<v Speaker 1>golden age and everybody wants to retire</v>

2926
02:11:10.291 --> 02:11:12.360
<v Speaker 1>and sit on the couch and put your feet </v>
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

2927
02:11:12.600 --> 02:11:15.030
<v Speaker 1>That's horseshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not you.</v>

2928
02:11:15.070 --> 02:11:20.070
<v Speaker 1>You only.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You only can experience that and enjoy </v>

2929
02:11:20.070 --> 02:11:21.120
<v Speaker 1>it if you've earned it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one wants to earn it.</v>

2930
02:11:21.180 --> 02:11:24.000
<v Speaker 1>The earning is the most important part </v>
<v Speaker 1>of your life.</v>

2931
02:11:24.060 --> 02:11:24.990
<v Speaker 1>Individual risks,</v>

2932
02:11:25.040 --> 02:11:27.230
<v Speaker 2>possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody has it.</v>

2933
02:11:27.280 --> 02:11:28.760
<v Speaker 2>You've got to earn it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got to work for it.</v>

2934
02:11:28.761 --> 02:11:32.450
<v Speaker 2>You gotta you know so much better when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you do.</v>

2935
02:11:32.530 --> 02:11:33.430
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2936
02:11:33.431 --> 02:11:35.200
<v Speaker 1>that's why I think guys like you were </v>
<v Speaker 1>important,</v>

2937
02:11:35.201 --> 02:11:36.950
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you set a great example of that.</v>

2938
02:11:37.270 --> 02:11:39.520
<v Speaker 1>I think you said a great example with </v>
<v Speaker 1>your words.</v>

2939
02:11:39.521 --> 02:11:41.590
<v Speaker 1>I think you set a great example with </v>
<v Speaker 1>your actions.</v>

2940
02:11:41.800 --> 02:11:44.470
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the reasons why I've been </v>
<v Speaker 1>wanting to talk to you on the podcast.</v>

2941
02:11:44.471 --> 02:11:46.630
<v Speaker 1>You're a very inspirational guy in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>opinion.</v>

2942
02:11:46.990 --> 02:11:51.990
<v Speaker 1>I think you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way you talk about things and the </v>

2943
02:11:51.990 --> 02:11:51.990
<v Speaker 1>way you express yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2944
02:11:51.990 --> 02:11:54.880
<v Speaker 1>it's admirable and I think it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it helps people,</v>

2945
02:11:54.930 --> 02:11:58.150
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it sets a very high standard and I think</v>

2946
02:11:58.151 --> 02:12:03.130
<v Speaker 1>setting a high standard is one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>key things that young men and young,</v>

2947
02:12:03.131 --> 02:12:05.770
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure young women as well need in </v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

2948
02:12:05.800 --> 02:12:07.360
<v Speaker 1>They need to see a high standard.</v>

2949
02:12:07.810 --> 02:12:12.560
<v Speaker 2>I'm not perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I make mistakes probably way too much or</v>

2950
02:12:12.570 --> 02:12:17.570
<v Speaker 2>more often than I'd like to admit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm always searching and seeking to </v>

2951
02:12:18.780 --> 02:12:19.660
<v Speaker 2>get better know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2952
02:12:19.920 --> 02:12:22.860
<v Speaker 2>and I think that's something that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>always tried to project.</v>

2953
02:12:23.340 --> 02:12:24.150
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2954
02:12:24.151 --> 02:12:26.220
<v Speaker 2>and the only way to get theirs is like </v>
<v Speaker 2>you've just said,</v>

2955
02:12:26.221 --> 02:12:27.270
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's through hard work.</v>

2956
02:12:27.271 --> 02:12:28.480
<v Speaker 2>It's through determination.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

2957
02:12:28.481 --> 02:12:28.840
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2958
02:12:28.870 --> 02:12:33.180
<v Speaker 2>it's through the amazing innate part of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the human being,</v>

2959
02:12:33.210 --> 02:12:35.780
<v Speaker 2>which is the ability to do,</v>

02:13:08.530 --> 02:13:11.620
<v Speaker 1>It's like a duffle bag that you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>carry guns in.</v>

2975
02:13:11.770 --> 02:13:16.210
<v Speaker 1>It's large and it's durable and it gets </v>
<v Speaker 1>dirty and filled with liquid,</v>

2976
02:13:16.600 --> 02:13:18.460
<v Speaker 1>but don't worry about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can hang in there.</v>

2977
02:13:18.910 --> 02:13:23.910
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I was saying to Tim that's </v>

2978
02:13:23.910 --> 02:13:25.951
<v Speaker 1>important is I think everybody has this </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea that there's some guy out there </v>

2979
02:13:25.951 --> 02:13:27.970
<v Speaker 1>that's like jet Li that's like a perfect</v>
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>

2980
02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:29.470
<v Speaker 1>Some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some character.</v>

2981
02:13:29.740 --> 02:13:32.790
<v Speaker 1>There's the beauty really in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>imperfection.</v>

2982
02:13:33.090 --> 02:13:38.090
<v Speaker 1>The beauty is in knowing that we're all </v>
<v Speaker 1>just these weird,</v>

2983
02:13:39.240 --> 02:13:42.150
<v Speaker 1>flawed creatures that are trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out.</v>

2984
02:13:42.151 --> 02:13:45.160
<v Speaker 1>It's not even that we're flawed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just that we're,</v>

2985
02:13:45.340 --> 02:13:50.340
<v Speaker 1>we're dealing with an impossible amount </v>
<v Speaker 1>of variables that we're constantly </v>

2986
02:13:50.340 --> 02:13:54.291
<v Speaker 1>navigating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this idea that you should have </v>

2987
02:13:54.421 --> 02:13:56.850
<v Speaker 1>gotten it right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not what it is.</v>

2988
02:13:56.880 --> 02:14:01.880
<v Speaker 1>It's the idea is that you learn from </v>
<v Speaker 1>what you get wrong and then that thing </v>

2989
02:14:03.181 --> 02:14:06.010
<v Speaker 1>you don't do the same way next time he </v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

2990
02:14:06.011 --> 02:14:11.011
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I made a mistake the last time I was in </v>

2991
02:14:11.011 --> 02:14:11.070
<v Speaker 1>a similar situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I know that,</v>

2992
02:14:11.071 --> 02:14:15.540
<v Speaker 1>and so now I'm going to power through </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the knowledge that I've accumulated</v>

2993
02:14:15.570 --> 02:14:18.610
<v Speaker 1>in my life from my past mistakes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a,</v>

2994
02:14:18.790 --> 02:14:23.790
<v Speaker 1>that's a huge factor about being a </v>
<v Speaker 1>person of huge factor is that we're all </v>

2995
02:14:24.481 --> 02:14:25.740
<v Speaker 1>learning from each other.</v>

2996
02:14:25.920 --> 02:14:30.920
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said a lot of cool shit when you're </v>

2997
02:14:30.920 --> 02:14:32.460
<v Speaker 1>gone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that is a that.</v>

2998
02:14:32.520 --> 02:14:37.520
<v Speaker 1>But learning and learning from each </v>
<v Speaker 1>other is the whole reason why it's great</v>

2999
02:14:37.711 --> 02:14:39.900
<v Speaker 1>to have inspirational people to draw </v>
<v Speaker 1>from.</v>

3000
02:14:40.110 --> 02:14:45.000
<v Speaker 1>And I think that now there's never been </v>
<v Speaker 1>a time like this where you could just go</v>

3001
02:14:45.001 --> 02:14:49.230
<v Speaker 1>on youtube and you could be inspired for</v>
<v Speaker 1>24 hours a day,</v>

3002
02:14:49.231 --> 02:14:54.231
<v Speaker 1>seven days a week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could watch videos of guys pushing </v>

3003
02:14:54.231 --> 02:14:57.381
<v Speaker 1>through things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Guys are doing fucking hundred mile </v>

3004
02:14:57.381 --> 02:15:00.520
<v Speaker 1>ultra marathons and just seeing people </v>
<v Speaker 1>talk about the things that inspire them </v>

3005
02:15:01.591 --> 02:15:04.170
<v Speaker 1>and what pushes them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's never been a time like this.</v>

3006
02:15:04.171 --> 02:15:07.050
<v Speaker 1>We just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>inspiration is available everywhere.</v>

3007
02:15:07.051 --> 02:15:07.380
<v Speaker 1>You look</v>

3008
02:15:08.280 --> 02:15:11.360
<v Speaker 2>in a whole bunch of different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not Everybody's inspired the same way,</v>

3009
02:15:11.390 --> 02:15:16.390
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I think it's amazing to see a guy </v>

3010
02:15:16.390 --> 02:15:19.400
<v Speaker 2>that has nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do something remarkable to come,</v>

3011
02:15:19.490 --> 02:15:21.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not the underdog,</v>

3012
02:15:21.381 --> 02:15:26.360
<v Speaker 2>but that has no resources that then </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's this guy in Austin,</v>

3013
02:15:26.361 --> 02:15:27.360
<v Speaker 2>Texas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his,</v>

3014
02:15:27.650 --> 02:15:31.490
<v Speaker 2>he runs this running group called </v>
<v Speaker 2>Gilbert Gazelles and um,</v>

3015
02:15:32.330 --> 02:15:36.320
<v Speaker 2>the who to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when the genocide that was occurring,</v>

3016
02:15:36.680 --> 02:15:40.370
<v Speaker 2>he has these burns on his body because </v>
<v Speaker 2>his family was murdered and he was piled</v>

3017
02:15:40.400 --> 02:15:42.620
<v Speaker 2>into this pile of bodies and set on </v>
<v Speaker 2>fire.</v>

3018
02:15:43.010 --> 02:15:47.990
<v Speaker 2>And once the militias,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm Ryan left from the Hutu in Tutus,</v>

<v Speaker 2>running there and then he went to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Olympics and now he runs.</v>

3021

<v Speaker 2>that just tells people to run.</v>

3022
02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:01.460
<v Speaker 2>And he's one of the most remarkable </v>
<v Speaker 2>human beings.</v>

3023
02:16:01.461 --> 02:16:06.461
<v Speaker 2>And there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's tons of people out there that </v>

<v Speaker 2>And then that I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love latching onto people like that </v>

3027

<v Speaker 2>I don't want to say steal it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I want some of that.</v>

3029
02:16:16.750 --> 02:16:21.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you don't steal it because they </v>

3030
02:16:21.750 --> 02:16:21.750
<v Speaker 1>still have it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3033
02:16:22.060 --> 02:16:23.500
<v Speaker 1>It's very important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

3034
02:16:23.501 --> 02:16:25.990
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we surround ourselves with inspirational</v>

3035
02:16:25.991 --> 02:16:29.500
<v Speaker 1>people and become inspired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Surround yourself with negative and your</v>

3036
02:16:29.501 --> 02:16:32.710
<v Speaker 1>life is going to be a wreck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a lot of people don't realize</v>

3037
02:16:32.711 --> 02:16:36.160
<v Speaker 1>that and they just try to work through </v>
<v Speaker 1>these negative constant life.</v>

3038
02:16:36.161 --> 02:16:37.960
<v Speaker 1>You've got to cut them off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3039
02:16:38.170 --> 02:16:41.080
<v Speaker 1>You got to cut them off and keep moving </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they will hold you back.</v>

3040
02:16:41.380 --> 02:16:45.190
<v Speaker 1>There are crabs in that bucket and when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you try to reach the top of that bucket,</v>

3041
02:16:45.191 --> 02:16:48.550
<v Speaker 1>they will latch ahold of your little </v>
<v Speaker 1>crab legs and drag you down with them.</v>

3042
02:16:48.920 --> 02:16:50.020
<v Speaker 2>Data was so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3043
02:16:50.030 --> 02:16:52.580
<v Speaker 2>retrospectively my dad was so wise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when he's like,</v>

3044
02:16:52.790 --> 02:16:53.920
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't want those guys around,</v>

3045
02:16:53.921 --> 02:16:56.930
<v Speaker 2>you know you're going to be who you </v>
<v Speaker 2>surround yourself with.</v>

3046
02:16:57.000 --> 02:16:57.650
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>

3047
02:16:57.950 --> 02:16:58.730
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that guy is,</v>

3048
02:16:58.900 --> 02:16:59.740
<v Speaker 1>cool,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Haley,</v>

3049
02:16:59.830 --> 02:17:00.550
<v Speaker 1>that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3050
02:17:00.551 --> 02:17:02.480
<v Speaker 1>and now I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

3051
02:17:03.550 --> 02:17:05.650
<v Speaker 1>it's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How did he know so early.</v>

3052
02:17:05.770 --> 02:17:07.660
<v Speaker 1>There's always gonna be people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>will.</v>

3053
02:17:07.690 --> 02:17:10.110
<v Speaker 1>But those people are also important </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you,</v>

3054
02:17:10.130 --> 02:17:11.530
<v Speaker 1>you learn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3055
02:17:11.531 --> 02:17:14.470
<v Speaker 1>you learn from watching them fuck their </v>
<v Speaker 1>lives up.</v>

3056
02:17:14.650 --> 02:17:19.650
<v Speaker 1>I've never done cocaine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the reasons why I never did </v>

3057
02:17:19.650 --> 02:17:22.261
<v Speaker 1>cocaine is because I grew up with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>buddy of mine who's cousin was selling </v>

3058
02:17:22.261 --> 02:17:25.450
<v Speaker 1>cocaine and I watched this guy fall </v>
<v Speaker 1>apart.</v>

3059
02:17:25.480 --> 02:17:25.920
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

3060
02:17:25.960 --> 02:17:30.960
<v Speaker 1>him and his girlfriend would just do </v>
<v Speaker 1>blow and they would hide out in their </v>

3061
02:17:30.960 --> 02:17:33.751
<v Speaker 1>place and they would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had this attic apartment and they </v>

3062
02:17:33.751 --> 02:17:34.660
<v Speaker 1>would just fucking watch tv all day and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they would shrink.</v>

3063
02:17:34.840 --> 02:17:37.600
<v Speaker 1>Like their fucking face was shrinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their body was shrinking.</v>

3064
02:17:37.601 --> 02:17:39.820
<v Speaker 1>The all they would do is do coke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know if they ate,</v>

3065
02:17:40.060 --> 02:17:41.200
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I watched this guy,</v>

3066
02:17:41.260 --> 02:17:46.260
<v Speaker 1>it was like a guy who got bit by a </v>
<v Speaker 1>vampire and became like this disease </v>

3067
02:17:46.260 --> 02:17:46.260
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

3068
02:17:46.330 --> 02:17:47.590
<v Speaker 1>And I went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

3069
02:17:47.710 --> 02:17:49.970
<v Speaker 1>keep the fuck away from coke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

3070
02:17:50.020 --> 02:17:54.040
<v Speaker 1>And I didn't have to do coke and go to </v>
<v Speaker 1>rehab and pull myself out,</v>

3071
02:17:54.340 --> 02:17:54.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3072
02:17:54.731 --> 02:17:57.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I lived 40 plus years of my life with no</v>

3073
02:17:57.251 --> 02:17:59.380
<v Speaker 1>desire to do coke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck that.</v>

3074
02:17:59.800 --> 02:18:04.690
<v Speaker 1>And so it's not always good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need losers.</v>

3075
02:18:04.960 --> 02:18:07.060
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>losers are there too for a reason.</v>

3076
02:18:07.061 --> 02:18:09.430
<v Speaker 1>It's the whole world was filled with </v>
<v Speaker 1>inspirational winters.</v>

3077
02:18:09.431 --> 02:18:12.580
<v Speaker 1>Like how would you figure out where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where do we begin?</v>

3078
02:18:12.581 --> 02:18:16.390
<v Speaker 1>If everybody's a fucking winner now you </v>
<v Speaker 1>got to see people who ring that bell,</v>

3079
02:18:16.391 --> 02:18:18.490
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to see people who tap out quick.</v>

3080
02:18:18.810 --> 02:18:21.760
<v Speaker 1>You got to see a guy who tapped before </v>
<v Speaker 1>the choke is even sunk in.</v>

3081
02:18:21.761 --> 02:18:22.900
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you doing?</v>

3082
02:18:22.960 --> 02:18:25.570
<v Speaker 1>Types two taps to strikes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3083
02:18:25.571 --> 02:18:28.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes GSP versus Matt Serra,</v>

3084
02:18:28.630 --> 02:18:32.860
<v Speaker 1>sometimes it's good to tap to strikes </v>
<v Speaker 1>because fights over go anywhere.</v>

3085
02:18:32.980 --> 02:18:37.980
<v Speaker 1>When the guys on top of you dropping </v>
<v Speaker 1>bombs and you're starting to see sparks </v>

3086
02:18:37.980 --> 02:18:40.270
<v Speaker 1>and the elevator doors closing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you think tap strikes is a bad idea?</v>

3087
02:18:41.120 --> 02:18:44.160
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if I have it in me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

3088
02:18:44.230 --> 02:18:46.370
<v Speaker 2>Like right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying it's bad idea.</v>

3089
02:18:46.400 --> 02:18:49.160
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I should respect the guy that </v>
<v Speaker 2>smarter than I am,</v>

3090
02:18:49.190 --> 02:18:51.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I'm kind of like an oak.</v>

3091
02:18:51.710 --> 02:18:53.240
<v Speaker 2>I'm big,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm strong and I'm dumb,</v>

3092
02:18:53.550 --> 02:18:54.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I'm just,</v>

3093
02:18:54.160 --> 02:18:56.270
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to grow and I'm gonna do what </v>
<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>

3094
02:18:56.730 --> 02:19:01.730
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe I wish I was smart enough to tap </v>

3095
02:19:01.730 --> 02:19:01.730
<v Speaker 2>two strikes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I am.</v>

3096
02:19:01.730 --> 02:19:05.711
<v Speaker 2>I just don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I have it in me to be </v>

3097
02:19:05.711 --> 02:19:05.711
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

3098
02:19:05.711 --> 02:19:06.260
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to get outta here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just going to quit.</v>

3099
02:19:08.150 --> 02:19:09.650
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's any problem with </v>
<v Speaker 1>tablets,</v>

3100
02:19:09.660 --> 02:19:11.960
<v Speaker 1>trucks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I respect your viewpoint.</v>

3101
02:19:11.961 --> 02:19:16.961
<v Speaker 1>I know what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think you'd probably have to have </v>

3102
02:19:16.961 --> 02:19:19.271
<v Speaker 1>that sort of mentality to be an elite </v>
<v Speaker 1>level competitor in something like mma </v>

3103
02:19:19.401 --> 02:19:21.170
<v Speaker 1>where that's not even an option in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>head.</v>

3104
02:19:21.530 --> 02:19:23.290
<v Speaker 1>And this guys don't tap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3105
02:19:23.310 --> 02:19:25.790
<v Speaker 1>a good fucking war machine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just gets choked out.</v>

3106
02:19:25.791 --> 02:19:27.830
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of guys that just say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never tap.</v>

3107
02:19:27.831 --> 02:19:29.780
<v Speaker 1>I will go out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll get my arm broken.</v>

3108
02:19:30.140 --> 02:19:31.340
<v Speaker 1>Fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not tapping.</v>

3109
02:19:31.670 --> 02:19:33.260
<v Speaker 1>It's not in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3110
02:19:33.370 --> 02:19:33.910
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look good.</v>

3111
02:19:33.920 --> 02:19:35.510
<v Speaker 1>John Jones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we fought vittorio,</v>

3112
02:19:35.540 --> 02:19:38.730
<v Speaker 1>his arms completely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hyper extended tap ladder,</v>

3113
02:19:38.750 --> 02:19:42.170
<v Speaker 1>got let it get completely popped </v>
<v Speaker 1>backwards and then won the fight.</v>

3114
02:19:42.171 --> 02:19:42.530
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

3115
02:19:42.640 --> 02:19:47.640
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] is to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>before you go to special forces </v>

3116
02:19:47.640 --> 02:19:51.671
<v Speaker 2>selection,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's this phase four guys out the </v>

3117
02:19:51.671 --> 02:19:52.160
<v Speaker 2>street called [inaudible] special </v>
<v Speaker 2>operations preparation course.</v>

3118
02:19:52.220 --> 02:19:57.220
<v Speaker 2>The only thing that is isn't a trigger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They take like 400 dudes and they ended </v>

3119
02:19:57.220 --> 02:19:59.750
<v Speaker 2>up sending 80,</v>
<v Speaker 2>80 of them to selection the other 320 at</v>

3120
02:19:59.751 --> 02:20:02.090
<v Speaker 2>some point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Either got broke or quit.</v>

3121
02:20:02.510 --> 02:20:07.510
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember seeing the Gong that you go </v>

3122
02:20:07.510 --> 02:20:09.440
<v Speaker 2>up and hit and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so longingly looking at that thing being</v>

3123
02:20:09.441 --> 02:20:12.410
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the smart thing to do.</v>

3124
02:20:12.530 --> 02:20:13.310
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3125
02:20:13.311 --> 02:20:18.311
<v Speaker 2>you have blisters on your feet that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you've injected stuff into so that you </v>

3126
02:20:18.311 --> 02:20:21.911
<v Speaker 2>can't say like your skin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like glues back to what portion it </v>

3127
02:20:21.911 --> 02:20:22.470
<v Speaker 2>separated itself from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3128
02:20:22.490 --> 02:20:26.980
<v Speaker 2>like you've lost 20 pounds in the course</v>
<v Speaker 2>of 30 days and um,</v>

3129
02:20:27.030 --> 02:20:28.440
<v Speaker 2>and you're looking at that Gong and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

3130
02:20:28.730 --> 02:20:31.160
<v Speaker 2>a smart person would go and hit that </v>
<v Speaker 2>goal,</v>

3131
02:20:31.350 --> 02:20:33.290
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I watched guys go up and do it and I</v>

3132
02:20:33.291 --> 02:20:34.040
<v Speaker 2>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

3133
02:20:34.220 --> 02:20:36.980
<v Speaker 2>that's a smart person probably I didn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>have it in me.</v>

3134
02:20:37.550 --> 02:20:41.690
<v Speaker 2>So I'm maybe I'm dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's my take.</v>

3135
02:20:41.720 --> 02:20:44.080
<v Speaker 2>I'm either like too dumb,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3136
02:20:44.081 --> 02:20:47.030
<v Speaker 2>like there's a balance there and I think</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're kind of a green each other from,</v>

3137
02:20:47.090 --> 02:20:48.650
<v Speaker 2>with each other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from different perspectives.</v>

3138
02:20:48.790 --> 02:20:49.920
<v Speaker 1>Well I think the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

3139
02:20:49.930 --> 02:20:52.900
<v Speaker 1>you're being self deprecating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you calling yourself dumb,</v>

3140
02:20:52.960 --> 02:20:57.960
<v Speaker 1>it's not a dumb thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you wanted to be smart about the </v>

3141
02:20:58.481 --> 02:21:01.300
<v Speaker 1>amount of punishment that you endure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

3142
02:21:01.570 --> 02:21:06.570
<v Speaker 1>But if you wanted to build the highest </v>
<v Speaker 1>level of character and durability and </v>

3143
02:21:08.381 --> 02:21:11.740
<v Speaker 1>mental toughness possible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it would be dumb to hit that gun.</v>

3144
02:21:12.240 --> 02:21:14.710
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because the benefits of not hitting that</v>

3145
02:21:14.711 --> 02:21:19.711
<v Speaker 1>Gong is what you are today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would have got a cup of coffee and a </v>

3146
02:21:19.711 --> 02:21:19.711
<v Speaker 1>hot breakfast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You didn't.</v>

3147
02:21:19.711 --> 02:21:22.210
<v Speaker 1>I didn't get a cup coffee today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

3148
02:21:22.250 --> 02:21:24.550
<v Speaker 1>and have the knowledge that you didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>hit that golf.</v>

3149
02:21:25.420 --> 02:21:28.870
<v Speaker 1>It's a good looking gong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could go back,</v>

3150
02:21:28.871 --> 02:21:31.930
<v Speaker 1>I might have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're a thick guy for 185 pounds.</v>

3151
02:21:31.960 --> 02:21:33.760
<v Speaker 1>Like your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your built in a very,</v>

3152
02:21:33.761 --> 02:21:37.300
<v Speaker 1>you're very muscular weight class toward</v>
<v Speaker 1>my wife uses.</v>

3153
02:21:37.390 --> 02:21:38.080
<v Speaker 1>What do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

3154
02:21:38.081 --> 02:21:39.970
<v Speaker 1>what do you walk around that before you </v>
<v Speaker 1>start your cut</v>

3155
02:21:40.530 --> 02:21:42.810
<v Speaker 2>to like day of cut?</v>

3156
02:21:42.940 --> 02:21:43.540
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what?</v>

3157
02:21:43.580 --> 02:21:48.580
<v Speaker 1>Like if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you had a fight that was four months </v>

3158
02:21:48.580 --> 02:21:48.580
<v Speaker 1>from now and you don't have to worry </v>
<v Speaker 1>about your weight,</v>

3159
02:21:48.580 --> 02:21:49.820
<v Speaker 1>what are you going to work?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Way To?</v>

3160
02:21:49.821 --> 02:21:51.680
<v Speaker 1>Twenty to 20.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

3161
02:21:52.550 --> 02:21:53.990
<v Speaker 1>And did you fight light heavyweight at </v>
<v Speaker 1>all?</v>

3162
02:21:54.230 --> 02:21:59.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think at wcs heavyweight ifl is a </v>

3163
02:21:59.230 --> 02:22:03.731
<v Speaker 2>light heavyweight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Middleweight and then I've stayed at </v>

3164
02:22:03.731 --> 02:22:03.731
<v Speaker 2>middleweight.</v>

3165
02:22:03.731 --> 02:22:04.570
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you,</v>

3166
02:22:04.571 --> 02:22:07.030
<v Speaker 1>if you're walking around in the two </v>
<v Speaker 1>hundreds,</v>

3167
02:22:07.390 --> 02:22:10.750
<v Speaker 1>how do you navigate a weight cut to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>down to 185 pounds?</v>

3168
02:22:10.751 --> 02:22:15.751
<v Speaker 1>Because that is a big issue in mma is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that point of diminishing returns where </v>

3169
02:22:15.751 --> 02:22:18.670
<v Speaker 1>some guys like Anthony Rumble Johnson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Perfect example.</v>

3170
02:22:18.730 --> 02:22:19.450
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's good at two.</v>

3171
02:22:19.451 --> 02:22:20.800
<v Speaker 1>Oh five.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

3172
02:22:21.040 --> 02:22:24.610
<v Speaker 1>The kid was so fucking big in between </v>
<v Speaker 1>fights.</v>

3173
02:22:24.850 --> 02:22:27.860
<v Speaker 1>I see him walking around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was fighting at one 74.</v>

3174
02:22:27.880 --> 02:22:30.960
<v Speaker 1>Kevin Burns and I saw him like two </v>
<v Speaker 1>months later it was 2:30.</v>

3175
02:22:30.961 --> 02:22:32.430
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck are you?</v>

3176
02:22:33.650 --> 02:22:35.280
<v Speaker 1>He's a house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was bigger than,</v>

3177
02:22:35.470 --> 02:22:38.100
<v Speaker 1>or I mean he was just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was on inside mma would fade or,</v>

3178
02:22:38.101 --> 02:22:40.890
<v Speaker 1>and he was towering over them wider,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thicker.</v>

3179
02:22:40.891 --> 02:22:42.630
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is going on?</v>

3180
02:22:42.870 --> 02:22:45.450
<v Speaker 1>And then finally he gets his shit </v>
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>

3181
02:22:45.570 --> 02:22:50.570
<v Speaker 1>decides to come back as a light </v>
<v Speaker 1>heavyweight and dominate sill Davis at </v>

3182
02:22:50.570 --> 02:22:50.970
<v Speaker 1>two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh five.</v>

3183
02:22:50.971 --> 02:22:51.870
<v Speaker 1>And you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

3184
02:22:51.871 --> 02:22:55.590
<v Speaker 1>this kid was obviously past the point of</v>
<v Speaker 1>diminishing returns.</v>

3185
02:22:55.591 --> 02:23:00.591
<v Speaker 1>He was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was diminishing his own ability to </v>

3186
02:23:00.591 --> 02:23:00.600
<v Speaker 1>perform by cutting so much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wait,</v>

3187
02:23:01.380 --> 02:23:02.580
<v Speaker 1>what is that number?</v>

3188
02:23:03.050 --> 02:23:05.090
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's different for every athlete</v>

3189
02:23:05.091 --> 02:23:05.960
<v Speaker 2>and person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3190
02:23:06.080 --> 02:23:07.760
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3191
02:23:07.761 --> 02:23:11.720
<v Speaker 2>when I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I'm to 15 to 20,</v>

3192
02:23:11.750 --> 02:23:15.410
<v Speaker 2>I feel like I'm a juggernaut.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never have training related injuries,</v>

3193
02:23:15.411 --> 02:23:16.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I,</v>

3194
02:23:16.670 --> 02:23:18.950
<v Speaker 2>I'm running an extra three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>four percent body fat.</v>

3195
02:23:19.370 --> 02:23:22.340
<v Speaker 2>I'm just like all around healthier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My brain's working right.</v>

3196
02:23:22.341 --> 02:23:24.380
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like my libido is good,</v>

3197
02:23:24.381 --> 02:23:27.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sleeping very soundly,</v>

3198
02:23:27.171 --> 02:23:28.170
<v Speaker 2>all eight hours,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3199
02:23:28.171 --> 02:23:29.420
<v Speaker 2>like things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything's great.</v>

3200

<v Speaker 2>we're like that five percent body fat.</v>

3203
02:23:39.410 --> 02:23:41.780
<v Speaker 2>My brain's not firing on all cylinders,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3204
02:23:41.790 --> 02:23:45.350
<v Speaker 2>like it's libidos rough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're training three,</v>

3205
02:23:45.351 --> 02:23:48.070
<v Speaker 2>four times a day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like just things suck.</v>

3206
02:23:48.370 --> 02:23:50.150
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything hurts.</v>

3207
02:23:50.630 --> 02:23:55.630
<v Speaker 2>You get down to five percent body fat </v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're like one 95 [inaudible] are </v>

3208
02:23:55.630 --> 02:23:56.420
<v Speaker 2>you doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how are you measuring it?</v>

3209
02:23:56.920 --> 02:24:00.480
<v Speaker 2>A pinch test water stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The water tanks and then um,</v>

3210
02:24:00.560 --> 02:24:05.560
<v Speaker 2>the calipers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a lot that's really low and then </v>

3211
02:24:05.560 --> 02:24:07.040
<v Speaker 2>you're going to cut another 10 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just water,</v>

3212
02:24:07.460 --> 02:24:12.460
<v Speaker 2>10 pounds of water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think our final cuts usually like </v>

3213
02:24:12.460 --> 02:24:13.230
<v Speaker 2>eight pounds of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

02:24:13.260 --> 02:24:14.840
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my body doesn't.</v>

3215

<v Speaker 2>I fought Michael Bisbing us probably </v>

3217
02:24:22.620 --> 02:24:22.640

<v Speaker 2>Oh five when I fought him,</v>

3218
02:24:22.690 --> 02:24:27.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I weighed in at one or one 86 the day </v>

3219

<v Speaker 2>before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3220
02:24:27.690 --> 02:24:29.550
<v Speaker 2>and then 30 hours later,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3221
02:24:29.600 --> 02:24:33.350
<v Speaker 2>I've been eating and drinking and </v>
<v Speaker 2>feeling fantastic.</v>

3222
02:24:33.410 --> 02:24:36.230
<v Speaker 2>Do you recruit for that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many apps do you use?</v>

3223
02:24:36.410 --> 02:24:41.410
<v Speaker 2>1,500</v>
<v Speaker 2>milliliters to 2000 leaders like the </v>

3224
02:24:41.410 --> 02:24:41.780
<v Speaker 2>greener.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I honestly don't know.</v>

3225
02:24:41.810 --> 02:24:43.250
<v Speaker 2>Fighters that don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

02:24:43.310 --> 02:24:44.350
<v Speaker 2>And nowadays,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3227
02:24:44.480 --> 02:24:49.480
<v Speaker 2>pretty much everybody does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unless you're like a frankie edgar that </v>

3228
02:24:49.480 --> 02:24:52.060
<v Speaker 2>literally weighs in at what he fights </v>
<v Speaker 2>that maybe it was like pretty rare </v>

3229
02:24:52.060 --> 02:24:52.060
<v Speaker 2>weights in his pocket.</v>

3230
02:24:52.250 --> 02:24:54.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Frankie fought at 1:55</v>

3231
02:24:54.141 --> 02:24:56.480
<v Speaker 2>and weighed 1:55.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Liotta machita fought a two.</v>

3232
02:24:56.481 --> 02:24:58.750
<v Speaker 2>Oh three for the longest time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

3233
02:24:58.790 --> 02:24:59.690
<v Speaker 2>weighed in at two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3234
02:24:59.691 --> 02:25:02.060
<v Speaker 2>three for 200,</v>
<v Speaker 2>five pound weight class.</v>

3235
02:25:02.090 --> 02:25:04.100
<v Speaker 2>But look how good he is at 1:45.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Better,</v>

3236
02:25:04.160 --> 02:25:04.940
<v Speaker 2>much better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know.</v>

3237
02:25:04.970 --> 02:25:07.520
<v Speaker 2>So the diminishing returns,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it's different for everybody.</v>

3238
02:25:07.850 --> 02:25:09.290
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>There's no way I can hang with the tool </v>

3241

<v Speaker 2>fibers that have 86 and teaches,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3243
02:25:20.810 --> 02:25:22.340

<v Speaker 2>it might be as strong as they are,</v>

3244
02:25:23.320 --> 02:25:23.810
<v Speaker 2>but I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3245
02:25:23.880 --> 02:25:26.080
<v Speaker 2>like as Brian Stan calls me like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>squat,</v>

3246
02:25:26.410 --> 02:25:28.270
<v Speaker 2>a little hobbit,</v>

3248
02:25:31.901 --> 02:25:34.330
<v Speaker 2>but he's right and I just can't reach </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

3249
02:25:34.390 --> 02:25:39.390
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like John Jones can runs around the </v>

3252
02:25:41.081 --> 02:25:43.390
<v Speaker 2>then he violates me with something </v>
<v Speaker 2>painful.</v>

3253
02:25:43.810 --> 02:25:45.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you ever</v>

3254
02:25:45.250 --> 02:25:47.320

<v Speaker 1>Is that possible?</v>

3255
02:25:47.670 --> 02:25:49.180
<v Speaker 2>Definitely possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3256
02:25:49.360 --> 02:25:50.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've um,</v>

3257
02:25:51.510 --> 02:25:54.300
<v Speaker 2>honestly had robbie lawler beat Johnny </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hendricks.</v>

3258
02:25:55.380 --> 02:25:57.600
<v Speaker 2>I always out I would cut to fight </v>
<v Speaker 2>Robbie.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five or 2:20</v>

3263
02:26:04.541 --> 02:26:09.541
<v Speaker 1>rather.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it because you're lifting weights is </v>

3264
02:26:09.541 --> 02:26:09.541
<v Speaker 1>because you're doing a lot of.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

3266
02:26:10.840 --> 02:26:11.540
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like,</v>

3267
02:26:11.560 --> 02:26:15.190
<v Speaker 2>I treat the annual cycle of like fight </v>
<v Speaker 2>camp,</v>

3268
02:26:15.191 --> 02:26:16.960
<v Speaker 2>post fight camp,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pre fight camp,</v>

3269
02:26:16.961 --> 02:26:19.230
<v Speaker 2>fight camp fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm Kinda,</v>

3270
02:26:19.340 --> 02:26:21.280
<v Speaker 2>if you look at like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like an nfl player,</v>

3271
02:26:21.310 --> 02:26:26.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have the pre season where there </v>

3272
02:26:26.310 --> 02:26:28.060
<v Speaker 2>they're trying to get their body strong </v>
<v Speaker 2>and healthy so that when they go into </v>

3273
02:26:28.060 --> 02:26:30.350
<v Speaker 2>the season they have everything that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they need to,</v>

3274
02:26:30.590 --> 02:26:32.880
<v Speaker 2>to perform during that season.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3275
02:26:33.220 --> 02:26:38.220
<v Speaker 2>so like my pre fight camp,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like right now where I'm lifting </v>

3276
02:26:38.220 --> 02:26:41.280
<v Speaker 2>weights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing a high volume of work where I'm </v>

3277
02:26:41.280 --> 02:26:43.021
<v Speaker 2>working on like my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my sparring stuff now is a lot more </v>

3278
02:26:44.111 --> 02:26:49.111
<v Speaker 2>drill oriented.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not burning tons of calories </v>

3279
02:26:49.111 --> 02:26:50.020
<v Speaker 2>grappling or boxing or sparring,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kickboxing.</v>

3280
02:26:50.880 --> 02:26:54.400
<v Speaker 2>I'm lifting a lot of weights so my </v>
<v Speaker 2>body's responsibly like getting healthy,</v>

3281
02:26:54.401 --> 02:26:55.420
<v Speaker 2>big and strong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

3282
02:26:55.421 --> 02:26:58.180
<v Speaker 2>I'm getting my technique better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when I move into that fight camp,</v>

3283
02:26:58.181 --> 02:27:01.570
<v Speaker 2>I have this mold of clay that's totally </v>
<v Speaker 2>healthy,</v>

3284
02:27:01.571 --> 02:27:05.240
<v Speaker 2>that can be shaped into what needs to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>shaped to be executed for,</v>

3285
02:27:05.460 --> 02:27:06.610
<v Speaker 2>for a particular fight.</v>

3286
02:27:07.100 --> 02:27:12.100
<v Speaker 1>So when you think about like 2:20</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the garlic rumble Johnson who used </v>

3287
02:27:12.100 --> 02:27:14.730
<v Speaker 1>to weigh somewhere around that even </v>
<v Speaker 1>heavier and get down to one 70 crazy.</v>

3288
02:27:14.900 --> 02:27:18.320
<v Speaker 1>If you were going to get down to one 70,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if Robbie lawler beat Johnny Hendricks,</v>

3289
02:27:19.250 --> 02:27:24.250
<v Speaker 1>how would you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would you cut out the weightlifting and </v>

3290
02:27:24.250 --> 02:27:26.471
<v Speaker 1>start doing like marathon running?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what would you do to get yourself </v>

3291
02:27:26.471 --> 02:27:26.471
<v Speaker 1>leaner?</v>

3292
02:27:26.471 --> 02:27:26.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3293
02:27:26.750 --> 02:27:29.410
<v Speaker 2>what would it be leaner or would it be </v>
<v Speaker 2>like less muscle?</v>

3294
02:27:29.470 --> 02:27:34.470
<v Speaker 2>A little bit of both.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I definitely have to lose a little bit </v>

3295
02:27:34.470 --> 02:27:34.470
<v Speaker 2>of muscle to be able to.</v>

3296
02:27:34.470 --> 02:27:36.140
<v Speaker 1>And how would you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>By not lifting or</v>

3297
02:27:36.350 --> 02:27:38.390
<v Speaker 2>just changing the type of lifting that </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing,</v>

3298
02:27:38.391 --> 02:27:38.970
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I'm,</v>

3299
02:27:39.010 --> 02:27:41.090
<v Speaker 2>I'm not doing those three rep max is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have dead lifted,</v>

3300
02:27:41.110 --> 02:27:42.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>four or 500 pounds.</v>

3301
02:27:42.471 --> 02:27:43.770
<v Speaker 2>So what'd you do these days?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3302
02:27:44.150 --> 02:27:45.080
<v Speaker 2>like right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3303
02:27:45.081 --> 02:27:46.220
<v Speaker 2>absolutely unloving it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3304
02:27:46.240 --> 02:27:49.490
<v Speaker 2>it's like I did shrugs yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just shrugged.</v>

3305
02:27:49.760 --> 02:27:50.960

<v Speaker 2>not just drugs,</v>

3306
02:27:50.961 --> 02:27:54.610
<v Speaker 2>but I got to do shrugs as actually my </v>
<v Speaker 2>strength because I'm like,</v>

3307
02:27:54.710 --> 02:27:57.770

<v Speaker 2>You shut your mouth,</v>

3308
02:27:57.771 --> 02:27:58.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

3309
02:27:58.630 --> 02:28:02.120
<v Speaker 2>like straps that you never allowed to </v>
<v Speaker 2>touch those.</v>

3310
02:28:02.121 --> 02:28:07.121
<v Speaker 2>And I was like looking at those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like how can I use some straps that </v>

3311
02:28:07.121 --> 02:28:07.310
<v Speaker 2>looks good and grab the bar and do some </v>
<v Speaker 2>more weight,</v>

3312
02:28:07.311 --> 02:28:07.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Now the point of departure is calm and </v>

3314
02:28:12.980 --> 02:28:12.980
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come back to me Tim,</v>

3315
02:28:12.980 --> 02:28:14.360
<v Speaker 2>and we're not doing curls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll let you do drugs.</v>

3316
02:28:14.361 --> 02:28:15.390
<v Speaker 2>But that's all you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3317
02:28:15.650 --> 02:28:20.650
<v Speaker 2>so straps being you don't do straub's </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you only want to lift with your </v>

3318
02:28:20.650 --> 02:28:20.650
<v Speaker 2>hands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can hold up.</v>

3319
02:28:20.740 --> 02:28:21.740
<v Speaker 2>What's the point?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3320
02:28:21.741 --> 02:28:22.010
<v Speaker 2>I don't</v>

3321
02:28:22.010 --> 02:28:23.430
<v Speaker 3>ever use straps.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

3322
02:28:23.680 --> 02:28:26.570
<v Speaker 3>I see people using straps and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>

3323
02:28:26.630 --> 02:28:29.750
<v Speaker 3>I get what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's use straps functionally though,</v>

3324
02:28:30.200 --> 02:28:32.660
<v Speaker 3>she'd be whatever you could carry with </v>
<v Speaker 3>your hands too.</v>

3325
02:28:33.320 --> 02:28:34.610
<v Speaker 3>Especially for a grappler,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3326
02:28:34.630 --> 02:28:35.410
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>

3327
02:28:36.650 --> 02:28:40.700
<v Speaker 3>So you would just start doing high reps </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing high volume a lot more speeds.</v>

3328
02:28:40.750 --> 02:28:44.360
<v Speaker 3>Like I think I think I'd have to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>faster to at one 70,</v>

3329
02:28:44.480 --> 02:28:49.480
<v Speaker 3>you know like watching these guys are </v>
<v Speaker 3>just like all over the place and you see</v>

3330
02:28:49.611 --> 02:28:52.280
<v Speaker 3>like Damien Maia when he dropped down to</v>
<v Speaker 3>one 70 and you know,</v>

3331
02:28:52.310 --> 02:28:54.900
<v Speaker 3>fought rick story and to see like the </v>
<v Speaker 3>difference in the,</v>

3332
02:28:54.910 --> 02:28:59.910
<v Speaker 3>just the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the amount of physical strength that he </v>

3333
02:28:59.910 --> 02:29:00.830
<v Speaker 3>had over a guy who was used to fighting </v>
<v Speaker 3>at one 70.</v>

3334
02:29:00.831 --> 02:29:03.140
<v Speaker 3>It's a big leap.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you think there should be more weight</v>

3335
02:29:03.141 --> 02:29:04.430
<v Speaker 3>classes?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3336
02:29:04.820 --> 02:29:06.070
<v Speaker 3>I do too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3337
02:29:06.080 --> 02:29:08.150
<v Speaker 3>I think the one 85 to 205.</v>

3338
02:29:08.180 --> 02:29:10.460
<v Speaker 3>Jesus fucking Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's 20 pounds.</v>

3339
02:29:10.760 --> 02:29:14.300
<v Speaker 3>There should be three champions in </v>
<v Speaker 3>between those weight classes or at least</v>

3340
02:29:14.390 --> 02:29:15.070
<v Speaker 3>to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3341
02:29:15.071 --> 02:29:19.550
<v Speaker 3>I mean if you look at a guy from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll go all the way down from like 1:55,</v>

3342
02:29:19.580 --> 02:29:19.970
<v Speaker 3>two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two.</v>

3343
02:29:19.971 --> 02:29:21.830
<v Speaker 3>Oh five.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know you have 55,</v>

3344
02:29:21.840 --> 02:29:22.790
<v Speaker 3>70,</v>
<v Speaker 3>85.</v>

3345
02:29:22.820 --> 02:29:25.520
<v Speaker 3>You have four weight classes from 1:55</v>
<v Speaker 3>to two.</v>

3346
02:29:25.521 --> 02:29:27.740
<v Speaker 3>Oh five.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>

3347
02:29:27.800 --> 02:29:28.820
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3348
02:29:28.821 --> 02:29:31.010
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's crazy and I think that,</v>

3349
02:29:31.130 --> 02:29:36.130
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people say that boxing is </v>

3350
02:29:36.130 --> 02:29:37.691
<v Speaker 3>watered down by all the weight classes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's watered down by all the </v>

3351
02:29:37.691 --> 02:29:37.691
<v Speaker 3>titles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't think there's anything wrong</v>

3352
02:29:37.691 --> 02:29:41.600
<v Speaker 3>with having a welterweight class at 1:47</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then a junior middleweight at 1:54</v>

3353
02:29:41.601 --> 02:29:44.120
<v Speaker 3>and then the middle weighted one 66 </v>
<v Speaker 3>pounds,</v>

3354
02:29:44.121 --> 02:29:46.760
<v Speaker 3>but you 1:54</v>
<v Speaker 3>and one slash 60 is fucking significant.</v>

3355
02:29:46.940 --> 02:29:51.940
<v Speaker 3>Six pounds and significant 20 pounds is </v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy and I just think that there's just</v>

3356
02:29:52.191 --> 02:29:57.191
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of fighters who are tweeners like </v>

3357
02:29:57.191 --> 02:29:57.191
<v Speaker 3>Diego Sanchez.</v>

3358
02:29:57.191 --> 02:29:57.920
<v Speaker 3>I think Diego should be fighting at one </v>
<v Speaker 3>65,</v>

3359
02:29:58.220 --> 02:29:59.840
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think when he gets to 1:55,</v>

3360
02:29:59.841 --> 02:30:02.740
<v Speaker 3>I think he's to diminished you scrawny </v>
<v Speaker 3>when he fights at one 70.</v>

3361
02:30:02.750 --> 02:30:07.750
<v Speaker 3>He's a little soft,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these little little small for some of </v>

3362
02:30:07.750 --> 02:30:10.571
<v Speaker 3>those really big giant dudes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I'm kind of between 85 and one </v>

3363
02:30:10.571 --> 02:30:10.820
<v Speaker 3>70,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like my shape,</v>

3364
02:30:11.300 --> 02:30:12.230
<v Speaker 3>my reach,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my height,</v>

3365
02:30:12.580 --> 02:30:15.680
<v Speaker 3>and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would love there to be like a 180.</v>

3366
02:30:15.800 --> 02:30:20.800
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really should be more of that in the </v>

3367
02:30:20.800 --> 02:30:24.550
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those are the things that I would like </v>

3368
02:30:24.550 --> 02:30:25.931
<v Speaker 3>to use to change the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the downward elbows and knees on the </v>

3369
02:30:25.931 --> 02:30:26.270
<v Speaker 3>ground and more weight class except a </v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of problems.</v>

3370
02:30:27.050 --> 02:30:29.210
<v Speaker 3>Dana,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can we go ahead and execute these things</v>

3371
02:30:29.211 --> 02:30:31.910
<v Speaker 3>that Joe and I have concurred on from </v>
<v Speaker 3>today's podcast?</v>

3372
02:30:32.150 --> 02:30:33.860
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not even Dana.</v>

3373
02:30:34.080 --> 02:30:39.080
<v Speaker 3>It's the athletic commissions through.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what's really crazy is that it's </v>

3374
02:30:39.080 --> 02:30:42.371
<v Speaker 3>sanctioned by athletic commissions and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you really don't have that much </v>

3375
02:30:42.371 --> 02:30:44.080
<v Speaker 3>influence over athletic commissions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3376
02:30:44.640 --> 02:30:46.580
<v Speaker 3>Especially,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well now the Keith Kaiser's gone.</v>

3377
02:30:46.581 --> 02:30:50.750
<v Speaker 3>Maybe they have a little bit more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't know how much they listen.</v>

3378
02:30:50.930 --> 02:30:55.930
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wish they would listen about a few </v>

3379
02:30:55.930 --> 02:30:58.390
<v Speaker 3>things for certainly downward elbows and</v>
<v Speaker 3>certainly at least consider revamping </v>

3380
02:30:58.390 --> 02:31:01.460
<v Speaker 3>the scoring system and then adding </v>
<v Speaker 3>weight classes.</v>

3381
02:31:02.190 --> 02:31:05.600
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the things about weight cutting,</v>

3382
02:31:05.690 --> 02:31:10.690
<v Speaker 3>do you find that are an issue like the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's obviously an issue with injuries</v>

3383
02:31:13.460 --> 02:31:17.030
<v Speaker 3>and there's obviously an issue with </v>
<v Speaker 3>diminishing health.</v>

3384
02:31:17.480 --> 02:31:20.730
<v Speaker 3>Do you worry about the long term </v>
<v Speaker 3>repercussions</v>

3385
02:31:20.730 --> 02:31:25.730
<v Speaker 1>of like there was an article recently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jim Miller was talking about weight </v>

3386
02:31:25.730 --> 02:31:25.730
<v Speaker 1>cutting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

3387
02:31:25.730 --> 02:31:28.260
<v Speaker 1>I know I've taken years off my life </v>
<v Speaker 1>through weight cutting.</v>

3388
02:31:28.860 --> 02:31:29.970
<v Speaker 1>Do you worry about that?</v>

3389
02:31:30.540 --> 02:31:35.540
<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The things that I am really conscious </v>

3390

<v Speaker 2>about my brain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>hurts me in the long term.</v>

<v Speaker 2>and I don't even think I've ever seen a </v>

3447
02:33:42.851 --> 02:33:45.410
<v Speaker 2>full episode,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I haven't.</v>

3448
02:33:45.500 --> 02:33:47.690
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I've seen like three quarters of </v>
<v Speaker 2>an episode.</v>

3449
02:33:48.050 --> 02:33:51.860
<v Speaker 2>But you done lost your red neck from our</v>
<v Speaker 2>rear admiral.</v>

3450
02:33:52.040 --> 02:33:57.040
<v Speaker 2>Those guys took values that they wanted </v>
<v Speaker 2>to project and they figured out a </v>

3451
02:33:57.040 --> 02:34:01.301
<v Speaker 2>conduit to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We might call them idiots and they have </v>

3452
02:34:01.301 --> 02:34:01.301
<v Speaker 2>horrible accents and they do stupid </v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

3453
02:34:01.301 --> 02:34:06.101
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they had a set of morals that they </v>

3454
02:34:06.101 --> 02:34:09.581
<v Speaker 2>try to convey and they found an avenue </v>
<v Speaker 2>to reach out millions of people,</v>

3455
02:34:10.070 --> 02:34:13.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I want that platform because I have</v>

3456
02:34:13.641 --> 02:34:15.830
<v Speaker 2>some good things to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I want to have an</v>

3458
02:34:18.040 --> 02:34:21.100
<v Speaker 3>opportunity to make a difference.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why don't you do a podcast,</v>

3459
02:34:21.280 --> 02:34:23.650
<v Speaker 3>start off with the podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do a podcast now.</v>

3460
02:34:23.860 --> 02:34:28.860
<v Speaker 3>Be like one of the first mma guys mean </v>
<v Speaker 3>Brendan Schaub does one with Brian </v>

3461
02:34:28.860 --> 02:34:29.340
<v Speaker 3>Cowen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But Brendan's kind of a meathead,</v>

3462
02:34:29.350 --> 02:34:30.720
<v Speaker 3>let's be honest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a great guy.</v>

3463
02:34:30.730 --> 02:34:33.460
<v Speaker 3>Love Him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you're so like,</v>

3464
02:34:33.461 --> 02:34:34.990
<v Speaker 3>you're intimidating and smart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

3465
02:34:34.991 --> 02:34:36.790
<v Speaker 3>how could I compete with the Joe </v>
<v Speaker 3>Roadblock as,</v>

3466
02:34:37.450 --> 02:34:39.070
<v Speaker 3>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't blow smoke up my ass.</v>

3467
02:34:39.820 --> 02:34:42.250
<v Speaker 3>I know what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not that smart.</v>

3468
02:34:42.280 --> 02:34:43.040
<v Speaker 3>You are?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nope.</v>

3469
02:34:43.150 --> 02:34:46.720
<v Speaker 3>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The argument with Joe because he doesn't</v>

3470
02:34:46.721 --> 02:34:48.910
<v Speaker 3>forget anything and he's deceivingly </v>
<v Speaker 3>smart.</v>

3471
02:34:49.310 --> 02:34:51.230
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm aware of these things.</v>

3472
02:34:51.260 --> 02:34:53.560
<v Speaker 3>I definitely look dumber than I am for </v>
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>

3473
02:34:53.561 --> 02:34:56.290
<v Speaker 3>But that's not saying much because they </v>
<v Speaker 3>look really fucking stupid.</v>

3474
02:34:56.350 --> 02:35:00.140
<v Speaker 3>I used that to my benefit as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like I'm an infantryman immigrant.</v>

3475
02:35:00.240 --> 02:35:02.200
<v Speaker 3>I'm an MMA fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm dumb.</v>

3476
02:35:02.740 --> 02:35:03.400
<v Speaker 3>Talk Shit to me.</v>

3477
02:35:03.430 --> 02:35:04.300
<v Speaker 3>Go ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For sure.</v>

3478
02:35:04.420 --> 02:35:05.440
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've definitely.</v>

3479
02:35:05.441 --> 02:35:10.441
<v Speaker 3>I smoked a lot of weed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got plenty of brain damage going </v>

3480
02:35:10.441 --> 02:35:10.441
<v Speaker 3>on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely,</v>

3481
02:35:10.441 --> 02:35:14.500
<v Speaker 3>but I'm not nearly as dumb as I look.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I look way fucking dumber.</v>

3482
02:35:15.850 --> 02:35:20.850
<v Speaker 3>I think you'd be great on a podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you and the beautiful thing </v>

3483
02:35:20.850 --> 02:35:21.880
<v Speaker 3>about a podcast is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I fucking swear to God,</v>

3484
02:35:21.881 --> 02:35:23.250
<v Speaker 3>everybody that comes on my podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I.</v>

3485
02:35:23.290 --> 02:35:25.930
<v Speaker 3>You should have a podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like trying to give.</v>

3486
02:35:26.080 --> 02:35:27.610
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't believe.</v>

3487
02:35:28.110 --> 02:35:30.220
<v Speaker 3>It's not that I don't believe in </v>
<v Speaker 3>competitions.</v>

3488
02:35:30.221 --> 02:35:35.221
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have the exact opposite of a famine </v>

3489
02:35:35.221 --> 02:35:35.221
<v Speaker 3>mentality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's.</v>

3490
02:35:35.221 --> 02:35:37.360
<v Speaker 3>There's 300 million people out there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody,</v>

3491
02:35:37.960 --> 02:35:40.600
<v Speaker 3>everybody could support everybody and </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's still plenty to go around.</v>

3492
02:35:41.060 --> 02:35:46.060
<v Speaker 3>I really believe that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but obviously my bladder even kindled </v>

3493
02:35:46.060 --> 02:35:46.060
<v Speaker 3>can't handle the podcasts at this </v>
<v Speaker 3>length,</v>

3494
02:35:46.060 --> 02:35:50.881
<v Speaker 3>so we.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've already discovered a limitation </v>

3495
02:35:50.881 --> 02:35:50.881
<v Speaker 3>to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3496
02:35:50.881 --> 02:35:54.871
<v Speaker 3>in your defense you have a one liter </v>
<v Speaker 3>smartwater and you've drank a big cup of</v>

3497
02:35:55.121 --> 02:35:55.900
<v Speaker 3>bulletproof coffee.</v>

3498
02:35:55.900 --> 02:35:59.200
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of liquids in there and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's also just stamina.</v>

3499
02:35:59.201 --> 02:36:04.201
<v Speaker 3>I just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I probably couldn't keep up with your </v>

3500
02:36:04.201 --> 02:36:06.361
<v Speaker 3>strength and conditioning program and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't keep up with my bladder </v>

3501
02:36:06.361 --> 02:36:06.361
<v Speaker 3>program.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My bladder is like a fucking,</v>

3502
02:36:06.361 --> 02:36:08.650
<v Speaker 3>like a leather Satchel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Back in the old days,</v>

3503
02:36:08.690 --> 02:36:12.130
<v Speaker 3>you can make them at a buffalo skins </v>
<v Speaker 3>strong and durable.</v>

3504
02:36:12.160 --> 02:36:14.500
<v Speaker 3>Lasts a lifetime handed down your </v>
<v Speaker 3>grandchildren.</v>

3505
02:36:15.400 --> 02:36:18.310
<v Speaker 3>You could easily do a podcast dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the beautiful thing about it is that</v>

3506
02:36:18.510 --> 02:36:20.490
<v Speaker 3>no one be able to tell you what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could,</v>

3507
02:36:20.820 --> 02:36:23.620
<v Speaker 3>no one would tell you what to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what to talk about.</v>

3508
02:36:23.621 --> 02:36:25.340
<v Speaker 3>You wouldn't have to converse with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>producers,</v>

3509
02:36:25.380 --> 02:36:30.380
<v Speaker 3>captivate enough people to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I want that the access to the </v>

3510
02:36:30.380 --> 02:36:30.880
<v Speaker 3>audience,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3511
02:36:31.120 --> 02:36:32.500
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to influence lives,</v>

3512
02:36:32.860 --> 02:36:33.340
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>would,</v>

3513
02:36:33.430 --> 02:36:36.040
<v Speaker 3>would my words have enough meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3514
02:36:36.370 --> 02:36:38.730
<v Speaker 3>to draw in enough people?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course they would.</v>

3515
02:36:38.760 --> 02:36:43.760
<v Speaker 3>I hope so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were there doing that right now if </v>

3516
02:36:43.760 --> 02:36:46.441
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right now millions of people are gonna </v>

3517
02:36:46.441 --> 02:36:46.441
<v Speaker 3>listen to this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I jump out of an airplane,</v>

3518
02:36:46.441 --> 02:36:46.441
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>into the water,</v>

3519
02:36:46.441 --> 02:36:51.130
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>into the ocean with a whole bunch of </v>

3520
02:36:51.130 --> 02:36:51.280
<v Speaker 3>sharks and go swim with them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like people are going to tune into that.</v>

3521
02:36:51.340 --> 02:36:53.070
<v Speaker 3>But what if you get eaten?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll start.</v>

3522
02:36:53.500 --> 02:36:58.500
<v Speaker 3>This whole thing is fucked now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then I get out of the water and I </v>

3523
02:36:58.500 --> 02:36:58.500
<v Speaker 3>can talk to them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3524
02:36:58.520 --> 02:37:03.520
<v Speaker 3>there's 16 million people watched him </v>
<v Speaker 3>parachute out of this plane into shark </v>

3525
02:37:03.520 --> 02:37:04.400
<v Speaker 3>infested waters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

02:37:04.420 --> 02:37:06.820
<v Speaker 3>you're out of your mind and wrote a </v>
<v Speaker 3>motorcycle up onto the beach.</v>

3527

<v Speaker 3>Trust me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to do that.</v>

<v Speaker 3>You've already done enough that you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>qualified.</v>

3531
02:37:15.090 --> 02:37:16.190
<v Speaker 3>You're qualified,</v>

3532

<v Speaker 1>legit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bad ass.</v>

3533
02:37:17.181 --> 02:37:20.180
<v Speaker 1>The idea that you're going to parachute </v>
<v Speaker 1>into sharks and that's going to change.</v>

3534
02:37:20.181 --> 02:37:22.130
<v Speaker 1>Everybody will ask.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The guy's a fucking pussy.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Bear.</v>

3541
02:37:35.231 --> 02:37:40.231
<v Speaker 1>His microphone is made from a maid in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>foreign land where quality is not </v>

<v Speaker 1>while,</v>

3554
02:38:07.641 --> 02:38:08.930
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while that's happening.</v>

3555
02:38:09.290 --> 02:38:13.310
<v Speaker 1>But the problem you're gonna have it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was doing a television show is producers</v>

3556
02:38:13.430 --> 02:38:18.430
<v Speaker 1>because they're going to look at you and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to try to put you in a </v>

3557
02:38:18.430 --> 02:38:19.220
<v Speaker 1>mold and they're going to try to get you</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do a bunch of fake shit.</v>

3558
02:38:19.550 --> 02:38:22.070
<v Speaker 1>They do fake shit man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They fake shit.</v>

3559
02:38:22.071 --> 02:38:24.590
<v Speaker 1>I had a problem with fake shit on my </v>
<v Speaker 1>Scifi show.</v>

3560
02:38:24.830 --> 02:38:27.680
<v Speaker 1>They faked a bunch of shit and I didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>find out about it until it was aired.</v>

3561
02:38:27.830 --> 02:38:32.830
<v Speaker 1>And I came on the podcast and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>apologized and I didn't know and it was </v>

3562
02:38:32.830 --> 02:38:34.430
<v Speaker 1>a huge fucking problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

3563
02:38:34.940 --> 02:38:37.160
<v Speaker 1>that was on a show called Joe Rogan </v>
<v Speaker 1>questions.</v>

3564
02:38:37.161 --> 02:38:42.161
<v Speaker 1>Everything like I'm trying to find the </v>
<v Speaker 1>truth about these things and their </v>

3565
02:38:42.161 --> 02:38:46.120
<v Speaker 1>instinct is still the fake shit and to </v>
<v Speaker 1>put fake shit in that you don't know </v>

3566
02:38:46.120 --> 02:38:46.120
<v Speaker 1>about that.</v>

3567
02:38:46.120 --> 02:38:48.200
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking horrible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very malleable.</v>

3568
02:38:48.220 --> 02:38:49.010
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3569
02:38:49.020 --> 02:38:51.380
<v Speaker 1>you're not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why podcasts is perfect.</v>

3570
02:38:51.760 --> 02:38:56.760
<v Speaker 1>You do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have a very unique vision and your </v>

3571
02:38:56.760 --> 02:38:58.160
<v Speaker 1>unique vision is qualified by your </v>
<v Speaker 1>unique life experiences.</v>

3572
02:38:59.030 --> 02:39:02.600
<v Speaker 1>Any Hollywood douche bag is not going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand that and they're going to try</v>

3573
02:39:02.601 --> 02:39:05.960
<v Speaker 1>to mold you and what they think could be</v>
<v Speaker 1>more profitable for the network,</v>

3574
02:39:06.230 --> 02:39:11.230
<v Speaker 1>but they would also have to sleep at </v>
<v Speaker 1>night and they'd be scared of what I </v>

3575
02:39:11.230 --> 02:39:11.230
<v Speaker 1>could do to them once they go to bed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they wouldn't.</v>

3576
02:39:11.230 --> 02:39:15.320
<v Speaker 1>They live in gated communities and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>hire people to keep an eye out for you.</v>

3577
02:39:15.470 --> 02:39:16.270
<v Speaker 1>Is this it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here?</v>

3578
02:39:16.290 --> 02:39:17.750
<v Speaker 1>Play that and I'll fix this thing.</v>

<v Speaker 2>both the black and white version and be </v>
<v Speaker 2>able to understand what the transition </v>

3613
02:41:44.441 --> 02:41:46.450
<v Speaker 2>the metamorphosis from the black to </v>
<v Speaker 2>White Swan.</v>

3614
02:41:46.451 --> 02:41:48.160
<v Speaker 2>It's scary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>scary process.</v>

3615
02:41:48.290 --> 02:41:50.530
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once you understand that about yourself,</v>

3616
02:41:51.610 --> 02:41:56.440
<v Speaker 2>there's really nothing more frightening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3617
02:41:56.470 --> 02:41:57.700
<v Speaker 2>that you could do in the rest of your </v>
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

3618
02:41:57.760 --> 02:42:02.760

<v Speaker 2>What is that show inside the actors </v>

3619
02:42:02.760 --> 02:42:05.161
<v Speaker 2>studio?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that analogous to your transition as </v>

3620
02:42:05.501 --> 02:42:08.500
<v Speaker 2>a fighter?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really,</v>

3621
02:42:08.530 --> 02:42:13.530
<v Speaker 2>really try to personify that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You the Black Swan or the white swan </v>

3622
02:42:14.111 --> 02:42:16.870
<v Speaker 2>when you fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's in me,</v>

3623
02:42:16.980 --> 02:42:19.510
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the journey to the Black Swan.</v>

3624
02:42:19.540 --> 02:42:20.560
<v Speaker 2>I'm neither,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3625
02:42:20.570 --> 02:42:23.560
<v Speaker 2>it's like the scary down the rabbit </v>
<v Speaker 2>hole.</v>

3626
02:42:23.650 --> 02:42:28.650
<v Speaker 2>Like I took the blue pill and now I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>becoming the Black Swan and there's </v>

3627
02:42:28.650 --> 02:42:33.001
<v Speaker 2>violent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>scary things on the way there and that </v>

3628
02:42:33.001 --> 02:42:35.780
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's where I try to fight that is on </v>

3629
02:42:35.780 --> 02:42:35.780
<v Speaker 2>the journey to the black school.</v>

3630
02:42:35.780 --> 02:42:37.330
<v Speaker 2>Is that why you come out to the rooster </v>
<v Speaker 2>now?</v>

3631
02:42:37.360 --> 02:42:39.220
<v Speaker 2>I come out to the rooster because it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>bad ass song.</v>

3632
02:42:39.250 --> 02:42:42.820
<v Speaker 2>It is a bad ass song.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And roosters like the fight they do like</v>

3633
02:42:42.821 --> 02:42:44.950
<v Speaker 2>to fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the songs about Vietnam,</v>

3634
02:42:45.460 --> 02:42:50.460
<v Speaker 2>it's about Vietnam vets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The hundred and first they used to call </v>

3635
02:42:50.460 --> 02:42:53.440
<v Speaker 2>the tail gunner or the machine gunners.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The rooster on the team.</v>

3636
02:42:53.500 --> 02:42:54.850
<v Speaker 2>Is that allison chains?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3637
02:42:55.720 --> 02:42:57.970
<v Speaker 2>So like POW,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mia,</v>

3638
02:42:58.000 --> 02:42:59.590
<v Speaker 2>Vietnam vets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of them.</v>

3639
02:42:59.591 --> 02:43:03.220
<v Speaker 2>That song,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the song was written by the bleaching or</v>

3640
02:43:03.250 --> 02:43:08.250
<v Speaker 2>about his father who are disenchanted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They grew apart and he kind of resented </v>

3641
02:43:08.250 --> 02:43:12.961
<v Speaker 2>him for being in the war and then he </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of had revelation that it was like </v>

3642
02:43:12.961 --> 02:43:14.090
<v Speaker 2>he had to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't have a choice.</v>

3643
02:43:14.091 --> 02:43:17.590
<v Speaker 2>He drafted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he wrote that song to,</v>

3644
02:43:17.680 --> 02:43:22.680
<v Speaker 2>to connect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>reconnect with his father who was a </v>

3645
02:43:22.680 --> 02:43:22.680
<v Speaker 2>Vietnam vet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that,</v>

3646
02:43:22.680 --> 02:43:27.160
<v Speaker 2>that song has a lot of meaning to me and</v>
<v Speaker 2>my community,</v>

3647
02:43:27.210 --> 02:43:28.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>veterans.</v>

3648
02:43:28.270 --> 02:43:30.430
<v Speaker 2>So everybody walk out of that Song,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

<v Speaker 2>there's not like,</v>

3650
02:43:33.070 --> 02:43:38.070
<v Speaker 2>I feel like there's nothing you could.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could hit me with a freight train </v>

3651
02:43:38.070 --> 02:43:38.070
<v Speaker 2>and I wouldn't care.</v>

3652
02:43:38.070 --> 02:43:39.960
<v Speaker 1>Grab portions of my body and try to keep</v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting.</v>

3653
02:43:40.020 --> 02:43:41.910
<v Speaker 1>It's a great fucking song for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3654
02:43:42.000 --> 02:43:46.110
<v Speaker 1>There's certain songs that just sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you hear that song and you know,</v>

3655
02:43:46.111 --> 02:43:51.111

<v Speaker 1>country board can survive when Matt </v>

<v Speaker 1>Stranglehold.</v>

3658
02:43:54.090 --> 02:43:57.660
<v Speaker 1>When Benevidez fights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joseph Benevidez fights comes out to Ted</v>

3659
02:43:57.661 --> 02:44:00.630

<v Speaker 1>there's certain songs that just persona </v>
<v Speaker 1>fly a fighter that's a,</v>

3662

<v Speaker 1>That's my song.</v>

3664
02:44:09.810 --> 02:44:12.070
<v Speaker 1>Do they give you any pressure about </v>
<v Speaker 1>songs?</v>

3665
02:44:12.071 --> 02:44:17.071
<v Speaker 1>Did they like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to approve it because I know </v>

3666
02:44:17.071 --> 02:44:17.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm Uriah Faber try,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3667
02:44:17.270 --> 02:44:20.590
<v Speaker 1>he always comes out to California love.</v>

3668
02:44:20.610 --> 02:44:24.070
<v Speaker 1>he wanted to do going back to Cali and </v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3669
02:44:24.120 --> 02:44:25.170
<v Speaker 1>they wouldn't let them do it.</v>

3670
02:44:25.610 --> 02:44:28.950
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's like the UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a,</v>

3671
02:44:29.120 --> 02:44:34.120
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure to them that they have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>get rights to use that music in the </v>

3672
02:44:35.181 --> 02:44:39.800
<v Speaker 2>production.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I have no idea how legally that that</v>

3673
02:44:39.801 --> 02:44:44.801
<v Speaker 2>occurs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So sometimes they have a list of what </v>

3674
02:44:44.801 --> 02:44:44.801
<v Speaker 2>you're allowed to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3675
02:44:44.801 --> 02:44:45.890
<v Speaker 2>there are some fight promotions were </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3676
02:44:45.910 --> 02:44:47.830
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>submit your,</v>

3677
02:44:47.900 --> 02:44:52.900
<v Speaker 2>your song that you want to walk out to </v>
<v Speaker 2>two weeks before and we'll see if we </v>

3678
02:44:52.900 --> 02:44:56.261
<v Speaker 2>can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it's approved or if we can get </v>

3679
02:44:56.261 --> 02:44:56.261
<v Speaker 2>approval.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3680
02:44:56.261 --> 02:44:57.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

3681
02:44:57.670 --> 02:44:58.450
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I dunno,</v>

3682
02:44:58.480 --> 02:45:03.480
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea how it works,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but thank God I can walk out to rooster </v>

3683
02:45:03.480 --> 02:45:03.480
<v Speaker 2>because I'd be really sad if I couldn't.</v>

3684
02:45:03.480 --> 02:45:03.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's perfect for you.</v>

3685
02:45:03.710 --> 02:45:08.710
<v Speaker 1>Do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad that you have an exit strategy </v>

3686
02:45:08.710 --> 02:45:09.760
<v Speaker 1>because there are a lot of fighters that</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't.</v>

3687
02:45:10.000 --> 02:45:15.000
<v Speaker 1>And the saddest thing to me is a guy who</v>
<v Speaker 1>looks at fighting as everything like </v>

3688
02:45:16.660 --> 02:45:19.690
<v Speaker 1>that is all they're capable of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is all they're ever going to be.</v>

3689
02:45:19.870 --> 02:45:24.870
<v Speaker 1>They don't know what to do next and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>get out of it and they have this thing </v>

3690
02:45:24.870 --> 02:45:24.870
<v Speaker 1>where they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

3691
02:45:24.870 --> 02:45:25.990
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're diminished.</v>

3692
02:45:25.991 --> 02:45:30.100
<v Speaker 1>Like you could see their aura is </v>
<v Speaker 1>diminished if you believe in Aras,</v>

3693
02:45:30.101 --> 02:45:35.101
<v Speaker 1>but whoever they are like seems less </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you were around them then who they </v>

3694
02:45:35.101 --> 02:45:36.940
<v Speaker 1>were when they were competing.</v>

3695
02:45:37.040 --> 02:45:37.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's true.</v>

3696
02:45:38.150 --> 02:45:43.150
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing more tragic than seeing </v>
<v Speaker 2>the guy that blood and sweat for your </v>

3697
02:45:43.461 --> 02:45:45.680
<v Speaker 2>entertainment and at the end of his </v>
<v Speaker 2>career,</v>

3698
02:45:45.950 --> 02:45:47.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he wasn't smart,</v>

3699
02:45:47.151 --> 02:45:49.460
<v Speaker 2>he didn't do things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3700
02:45:49.620 --> 02:45:52.130
<v Speaker 2>how he should have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then at the end of his career he has</v>

3701
02:45:52.131 --> 02:45:52.850
<v Speaker 2>nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3702
02:45:52.851 --> 02:45:56.450
<v Speaker 2>he's fought 20 fights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's broken physically and mentally,</v>

3703
02:45:56.890 --> 02:45:59.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there there's nothing left in him and he</v>

3704
02:45:59.061 --> 02:46:01.040
<v Speaker 2>has no resources to continue his life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3705
02:46:01.041 --> 02:46:02.450
<v Speaker 2>like I have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've ranger up,</v>

3706
02:46:02.480 --> 02:46:07.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that accompany that I'm intimately part </v>

3707
02:46:07.480 --> 02:46:07.480
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3708
02:46:07.480 --> 02:46:08.870
<v Speaker 2>I've great relationships with partners </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are going to go outside of the.</v>

3709
02:46:09.230 --> 02:46:12.800
<v Speaker 2>When I'm done fighting that are going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be part of whatever TV's series that I'm</v>

3710
02:46:12.801 --> 02:46:16.190
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it breaks my heart.</v>

3711
02:46:16.191 --> 02:46:17.390
<v Speaker 2>Seeing these guys that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3712
02:46:17.391 --> 02:46:19.730
<v Speaker 2>at the end of the careers they have </v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing and you're just like,</v>

3713
02:46:20.390 --> 02:46:21.480
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

3714
02:46:21.481 --> 02:46:23.170
<v Speaker 1>It breaks my heart too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it,</v>

3715
02:46:23.310 --> 02:46:28.310
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen it so many times that it just </v>

3716
02:46:28.310 --> 02:46:28.310
<v Speaker 1>drives me fucking nuts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3717
02:46:28.310 --> 02:46:28.310
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

3718
02:46:28.310 --> 02:46:29.430
<v Speaker 1>it just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it drives me nuts.</v>

3719
02:46:29.520 --> 02:46:34.520
<v Speaker 1>I almost want to like grab them in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>middle when they're peaking and go,</v>

3720
02:46:35.371 --> 02:46:37.290
<v Speaker 1>listen man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is beautiful,</v>

3721
02:46:37.380 --> 02:46:40.680
<v Speaker 1>but it ain't gonna last.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got to have something else.</v>

3722
02:46:40.681 --> 02:46:45.030
<v Speaker 1>You got to have something that you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>as much passion for as you do this.</v>

3723
02:46:45.510 --> 02:46:50.510
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's one area where you have an </v>
<v Speaker 1>advantage in that you've been in so many</v>

3724
02:46:51.511 --> 02:46:55.110
<v Speaker 1>life or death struggles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>firefights being deployed overseas,</v>

3725
02:46:55.111 --> 02:46:58.980
<v Speaker 1>seeing life and death and your </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective as far broader than a person</v>

3726
02:46:58.981 --> 02:47:03.981
<v Speaker 1>who's just been an athlete,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just been an athlete that is sought </v>

3727
02:47:03.981 --> 02:47:05.190
<v Speaker 1>glory and believes that that is the end </v>
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

3728
02:47:05.191 --> 02:47:05.610
<v Speaker 1>Be All.</v>

3729
02:47:06.930 --> 02:47:08.140
<v Speaker 2>Maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3730
02:47:08.160 --> 02:47:10.170
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I definitely have this perspective that,</v>

3731
02:47:10.590 --> 02:47:11.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have,</v>

3732
02:47:12.000 --> 02:47:14.310
<v Speaker 2>we have a shelf life as an athlete and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's short.</v>

3733
02:47:14.340 --> 02:47:17.670
<v Speaker 2>It's this window of opportunity that if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't capitalize on it,</v>

3734
02:47:17.671 --> 02:47:18.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's common,</v>

3735
02:47:18.270 --> 02:47:20.140
<v Speaker 2>it's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

3736
02:47:20.640 --> 02:47:22.050
<v Speaker 2>most people don't understand that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3737
02:47:22.051 --> 02:47:23.070
<v Speaker 2>we have this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

3738
02:47:23.250 --> 02:47:28.250
<v Speaker 2>this window to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to earn our earning potential is small </v>

3739
02:47:28.250 --> 02:47:28.250
<v Speaker 2>for an athlete.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3740
02:47:28.250 --> 02:47:28.620
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never had that.</v>

3741
02:47:29.070 --> 02:47:31.140
<v Speaker 2>This is something that I wanted to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to be champion.</v>

3742
02:47:31.141 --> 02:47:34.530
<v Speaker 2>I want to be champion and that's what </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to achieve in this window,</v>

3743
02:47:34.630 --> 02:47:39.630
<v Speaker 2>not financial gain or like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if I don't achieve it in that </v>

3744
02:47:39.630 --> 02:47:44.061
<v Speaker 2>window,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can move on to the next thing to then </v>

3745
02:47:44.061 --> 02:47:44.490
<v Speaker 2>achieve the next thing that I'm trying </v>
<v Speaker 2>to do.</v>

3746
02:47:44.970 --> 02:47:47.190
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these guys that go in there,</v>

3747
02:47:47.191 --> 02:47:47.790
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

3748
02:47:49.040 --> 02:47:51.450
<v Speaker 2>the Mike Tyson is a perfect example of </v>
<v Speaker 2>where,</v>

3749
02:47:51.451 --> 02:47:53.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he literally pissed it all away and then</v>

3750
02:47:53.311 --> 02:47:54.050
<v Speaker 2>at the end of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3751
02:47:54.060 --> 02:47:56.100
<v Speaker 2>what happened to $230 million dollars </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you had,</v>

3752
02:47:56.580 --> 02:47:57.420
<v Speaker 2>you're bankrupt.</v>

3753
02:47:59.150 --> 02:48:04.150
<v Speaker 1>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did he to stash away 10 can live off 10 </v>

<v Speaker 1>for a long fucking time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3756
02:48:07.680 --> 02:48:10.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy when you see those stories,</v>

3757
02:48:10.791 --> 02:48:15.791
<v Speaker 1>but it's almost like the Hubris that </v>
<v Speaker 1>allows you to be a combat athlete in a </v>

3758
02:48:15.791 --> 02:48:19.811
<v Speaker 1>lot of ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This idea that I'm different or like </v>

<v Speaker 2>I'm potentially one fight away.</v>

3786
02:49:20.720 --> 02:49:21.690
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3787
02:49:21.691 --> 02:49:26.691
<v Speaker 2>Mark Munoz and move saucier fighting.</v>

<v Speaker 2>winner of that fight?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3789
02:49:26.851 --> 02:49:28.440
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's definitely in the room too.</v>

3790
02:49:28.441 --> 02:49:30.870
<v Speaker 2>And if that's the case then maybe I am </v>
<v Speaker 2>too fights away.</v>

3791
02:49:31.710 --> 02:49:33.840
<v Speaker 2>If I cut down to one 70,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that.</v>

3792
02:49:34.170 --> 02:49:36.070
<v Speaker 2>Let me fight for the title,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3793
02:49:36.071 --> 02:49:38.640
<v Speaker 2>like I'd still be one fight away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe two.</v>

3794
02:49:39.090 --> 02:49:41.280
<v Speaker 2>So no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I'd be any closer.</v>

3795
02:49:41.970 --> 02:49:42.820
<v Speaker 2>Would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3796
02:49:42.900 --> 02:49:47.280
<v Speaker 2>physically the physicality of like me </v>
<v Speaker 2>being a bigger one 70 than a lot of guys</v>

3797
02:49:47.281 --> 02:49:48.900
<v Speaker 2>stronger than one 70.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

3798
02:49:49.110 --> 02:49:51.180
<v Speaker 2>there'd be benefits there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But again,</v>

3799
02:49:51.181 --> 02:49:56.181
<v Speaker 2>diminishing returns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what am I giving up for that in </v>

3800
02:49:56.181 --> 02:49:56.181
<v Speaker 2>exchange for.</v>

3801
02:49:56.181 --> 02:50:00.050
<v Speaker 3>Do you look at the window that you have?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean we've established that you think </v>

3802
02:50:00.050 --> 02:50:03.231
<v Speaker 3>you have a five year window.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know you don't want to give up the </v>

3803
02:50:03.231 --> 02:50:03.231
<v Speaker 3>number,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you did.</v>

3804
02:50:03.231 --> 02:50:04.320
<v Speaker 3>Do you do you look at that and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3805
02:50:04.321 --> 02:50:07.350
<v Speaker 3>if I do get to a title shot at one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a five,</v>

3806
02:50:07.380 --> 02:50:11.340
<v Speaker 3>how much time would I have left to work </v>
<v Speaker 3>myself up to a title shot at one 70?</v>

3807
02:50:11.520 --> 02:50:15.420
<v Speaker 3>Or would I regroup and try again at one </v>
<v Speaker 3>85 if I wasn't successful?</v>

3808
02:50:15.421 --> 02:50:20.421
<v Speaker 3>The first attempt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like do you have those thoughts in your </v>

3809
02:50:20.421 --> 02:50:20.421
<v Speaker 3>head or do you just think about next </v>
<v Speaker 3>fight?</v>

3810
02:50:20.421 --> 02:50:24.900
<v Speaker 2>No def.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I definitely have those thoughts in my </v>

3811
02:50:24.900 --> 02:50:25.330
<v Speaker 2>head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love having the five meter target.</v>

3812
02:50:25.360 --> 02:50:30.360
<v Speaker 2>That's the super close thing that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>looking at that I'm saying this is the </v>

3813
02:50:30.360 --> 02:50:32.791
<v Speaker 2>goal that I'm trying to achieve.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to get a perfect group in </v>

3814
02:50:32.791 --> 02:50:32.791
<v Speaker 2>right here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3815
02:50:32.791 --> 02:50:32.791
<v Speaker 2>that's that potential next opponent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3816
02:50:32.791 --> 02:50:33.370
<v Speaker 2>that's that guy that drank two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three,</v>

3817
02:50:33.371 --> 02:50:35.920
<v Speaker 2>four so I can get a title eliminator </v>
<v Speaker 2>type fight.</v>

3818
02:50:36.280 --> 02:50:38.770
<v Speaker 2>But then I see the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the long road.</v>

3819
02:50:38.771 --> 02:50:39.340
<v Speaker 2>We're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

02:52:58.940 --> 02:53:03.940
<v Speaker 3>he's like started coming right at me </v>
<v Speaker 3>after I just dominated him for 24 and a </v>

3885
02:53:03.940 --> 02:53:03.940
<v Speaker 3>half minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3886
02:53:03.940 --> 02:53:05.740
<v Speaker 3>He wasn't given.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm still trying to win that fight.</v>

3887
02:53:05.810 --> 02:53:07.510
<v Speaker 3>What a great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a tough dude.</v>

3888
02:53:07.590 --> 02:53:09.550
<v Speaker 3>No doubt about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's got some serious problems.</v>

3889
02:53:09.551 --> 02:53:14.140
<v Speaker 3>He's got a real injury to his neck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Affecting is a strength of his arm.</v>

3890
02:53:14.190 --> 02:53:15.040
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a,</v>

3891
02:53:15.340 --> 02:53:16.960
<v Speaker 3>he's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's as tough as they come.</v>

3892
02:53:16.990 --> 02:53:19.090
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's definitely as tough as they come,</v>

3893
02:53:19.270 --> 02:53:24.270
<v Speaker 3>but I know what you're saying as far as </v>
<v Speaker 3>guys that accumulate injuries and then </v>

3894
02:53:24.270 --> 02:53:25.870
<v Speaker 3>they get to a certain point in time like</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is left.</v>

3895
02:53:25.871 --> 02:53:30.871
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of guys that have done </v>

3896
02:53:30.871 --> 02:53:30.871
<v Speaker 3>less far,</v>
<v Speaker 3>far less,</v>

3897
02:53:30.871 --> 02:53:35.720
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>less successful than him that their </v>

3898
02:53:35.720 --> 02:53:35.720
<v Speaker 3>bodies have given out along the way.</v>

3899
02:53:36.100 --> 02:53:41.100
<v Speaker 3>It's a fucking hurt game,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the game and the hurt game is along </v>

3900
02:53:41.100 --> 02:53:45.571
<v Speaker 3>the way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just the amount of accumulation of </v>

3901
02:53:45.571 --> 02:53:45.820
<v Speaker 3>damage that you get in training.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Forget about.</v>

3902
02:53:45.910 --> 02:53:48.790
<v Speaker 3>That's what most casual fans just have </v>
<v Speaker 3>no idea.</v>

3903
02:53:49.280 --> 02:53:51.040
<v Speaker 3>You see little cuts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a little bit of blood,</v>

3904
02:53:51.041 --> 02:53:52.990
<v Speaker 3>a little bit of sweat and the fight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's nothing,</v>

3905
02:53:53.170 --> 02:53:58.170
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like leading up to my 25 minute fight </v>

3906
02:53:58.170 --> 02:54:00.870
<v Speaker 3>with Michael Bisping like my sparring </v>
<v Speaker 3>partners were like Bubbleq Danielle and </v>

3907
02:54:00.870 --> 02:54:04.141
<v Speaker 3>Carlos condit when they're are peaking </v>
<v Speaker 3>for their fights and then they moved on </v>

3908
02:54:04.141 --> 02:54:05.440
<v Speaker 3>and then I had John Jones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>myself,</v>

3909
02:54:05.800 --> 02:54:10.800
<v Speaker 3>like this room full of dudes that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>the best in the world and if we're </v>

3910
02:54:10.901 --> 02:54:15.850
<v Speaker 3>sparring two times a week for seven,</v>
<v Speaker 3>six,</v>

3911
02:54:15.851 --> 02:54:16.930
<v Speaker 3>seven,</v>
<v Speaker 3>eight weeks,</v>

3912
02:54:17.050 --> 02:54:18.580
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like leading up to that fight,</v>

3913
02:54:19.000 --> 02:54:24.000
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and like we're hitting each other just </v>

3914
02:54:24.000 --> 02:54:24.000
<v Speaker 3>as hard there as we are in the cage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3915
02:54:24.000 --> 02:54:28.420
<v Speaker 3>because you have to put,</v>
<v Speaker 3>push yourself as far as you can in </v>

3916
02:54:28.420 --> 02:54:30.370
<v Speaker 3>training so that the best element of who</v>
<v Speaker 3>you are,</v>

3917
02:54:30.400 --> 02:54:33.150
<v Speaker 3>what you are occurs in the cage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you,</v>

3918
02:54:33.180 --> 02:54:34.450
<v Speaker 3>how do you feel about that?</v>

3919
02:54:34.450 --> 02:54:39.450
<v Speaker 3>Like as far as like sparring hard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you think that you have to spar as </v>

3920
02:54:39.450 --> 02:54:42.130
<v Speaker 3>hard as you fight or do you think that </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a way?</v>

3921
02:54:42.131 --> 02:54:45.850
<v Speaker 3>Like Robbie lawler famously said that he</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't really spar much as sitting.</v>

3922
02:54:45.910 --> 02:54:47.200
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said he knows how to fight.</v>

3923
02:54:47.260 --> 02:54:52.260
<v Speaker 3>He said it's just about getting in shape</v>
<v Speaker 3>and working on his technique and I'm a </v>

3924
02:54:52.260 --> 02:54:53.320
<v Speaker 3>little ice bar way less than I used to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3925
02:54:53.321 --> 02:54:55.100
<v Speaker 3>like I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

3926
02:54:56.340 --> 02:55:00.580
<v Speaker 3>and on very rare occasions do I really </v>
<v Speaker 3>go all out.</v>

3927
02:55:00.730 --> 02:55:04.130
<v Speaker 3>But I think there are there times in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>fight</v>

3928
02:55:04.130 --> 02:55:09.130
<v Speaker 2>camp where both your coaches need to see</v>
<v Speaker 2>you and you need to see yourself when </v>

3929
02:55:10.521 --> 02:55:12.410
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're trying to do it all.</v>

3930
02:55:12.680 --> 02:55:13.160
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

3931
02:55:13.190 --> 02:55:14.570
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're broken,</v>

3932
02:55:14.571 --> 02:55:15.800
<v Speaker 2>when you're hurt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're tired,</v>

3933
02:55:16.220 --> 02:55:21.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and sometimes the only way to get there </v>

3934
02:55:21.220 --> 02:55:23.030
<v Speaker 2>is to push yourself to the limit and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they only put way to get there is man by</v>

3935
02:55:23.031 --> 02:55:23.720
<v Speaker 2>going after it.</v>

3936
02:55:23.870 --> 02:55:28.270
<v Speaker 1>And so you have to feel what it's like </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be inside that,</v>

3937
02:55:28.390 --> 02:55:29.030
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

3938
02:55:29.090 --> 02:55:31.930
<v Speaker 1>that position to be inside that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

3939
02:55:32.080 --> 02:55:37.080
<v Speaker 1>that position where you're just duking </v>
<v Speaker 1>it out at 100 percent.</v>

3940
02:55:38.120 --> 02:55:41.560
<v Speaker 1>There's no holding back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what it's like to be exhausted.</v>

3941
02:55:41.561 --> 02:55:43.720
<v Speaker 1>You know what it's like to be strong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what it's like to be hurt,</v>

3942
02:55:43.721 --> 02:55:46.730
<v Speaker 1>you know what it's like to bounce back </v>
<v Speaker 1>from being dominated in a,</v>

3943
02:55:46.731 --> 02:55:51.731
<v Speaker 1>in a training session.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's no substitution for that </v>

3944
02:55:51.731 --> 02:55:51.731
<v Speaker 1>actual fight.</v>

3945
02:55:51.760 --> 02:55:52.790
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

3946
02:55:53.120 --> 02:55:56.150
<v Speaker 2>In grappling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like do I ever am I in a position for,</v>

3947
02:55:56.151 --> 02:56:01.151
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a guy for me to work on an escape of an </v>

3948
02:56:01.151 --> 02:56:01.151
<v Speaker 2>bar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3949
02:56:01.151 --> 02:56:02.540
<v Speaker 2>there's a thousand ways I could have </v>
<v Speaker 2>prevented ever getting there.</v>

3950
02:56:02.840 --> 02:56:05.330
<v Speaker 2>But I still have to see what it's like </v>
<v Speaker 2>to get out of it.</v>

3951
02:56:05.870 --> 02:56:09.590
<v Speaker 2>And the only way I'll ever see what it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>like to get out of it is a film actually</v>

3952
02:56:09.591 --> 02:56:12.050
<v Speaker 2>put in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's the same in fighting like,</v>

3953
02:56:12.900 --> 02:56:13.760
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I,</v>

3954
02:56:13.790 --> 02:56:16.630
<v Speaker 2>when I thought I had really hurt my hand</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

3955
02:56:16.920 --> 02:56:17.610
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3956
02:56:17.720 --> 02:56:22.190
<v Speaker 2>in the first round and I sit down and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>come out the second round,</v>

3957
02:56:22.191 --> 02:56:23.370
<v Speaker 2>I just tanked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3958
02:56:23.371 --> 02:56:26.240
<v Speaker 2>like pain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>adrenaline dumps against,</v>

3959
02:56:26.380 --> 02:56:27.430
<v Speaker 2>against Mike,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3960
02:56:27.450 --> 02:56:29.500
<v Speaker 2>I come back to the court at the end of </v>
<v Speaker 2>second round and they're like,</v>

3961
02:56:29.700 --> 02:56:34.700
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you're gonna lose this fight if you </v>

3962
02:56:34.700 --> 02:56:34.700
<v Speaker 2>do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was at the pits,</v>

3963
02:56:34.700 --> 02:56:34.970
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like my hands hurt.</v>

3964
02:56:35.300 --> 02:56:37.250
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't sure if I could throw my right </v>
<v Speaker 2>hand again.</v>

3965
02:56:37.540 --> 02:56:39.020
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you through it?</v>

3966
02:56:39.290 --> 02:56:40.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was wrong with it?</v>

3967
02:56:41.040 --> 02:56:43.160
<v Speaker 2>A broken.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was broken,</v>

3968
02:56:43.400 --> 02:56:44.710
<v Speaker 2>but it's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I have,</v>

3969
02:56:44.890 --> 02:56:46.940
<v Speaker 2>I have the brakes in the car that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>supposed to be wearing.</v>

3970
02:56:46.941 --> 02:56:49.300
<v Speaker 2>I'm just embarrassed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's broken on it?</v>

3971
02:56:49.520 --> 02:56:51.090

<v Speaker 2>Broken through just a hairline fracture.</v>

3974
02:56:57.320 --> 02:56:59.000
<v Speaker 2>They said six weeks in a cast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

3975
02:56:59.001 --> 02:57:00.140
<v Speaker 2>I can't handle a cast.</v>
