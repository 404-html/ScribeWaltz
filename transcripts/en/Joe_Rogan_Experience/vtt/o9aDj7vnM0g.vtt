<v Speaker 2>California and Nashville.</v>

70
00:02:10.361 --> 00:02:12.070
<v Speaker 2>One of the points is the fault on that.</v>

71
00:02:12.071 --> 00:02:12.400
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>

72

<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

73
00:02:12.581 --> 00:02:13.331
<v Speaker 2>there's other faults.</v>

74
00:02:13.331 --> 00:02:14.410
<v Speaker 2>There's a fault near New York,</v>

75
00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.991
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

76
00:02:14.991 --> 00:02:16.060
<v Speaker 2>Does the Fort New York,</v>

77
00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.690
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

78
00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:17.081
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

79
00:02:17.081 --> 00:02:18.280
<v Speaker 2>there's a bunch of false man.</v>

80
00:02:18.281 --> 00:02:18.930
<v Speaker 2>It's like the,</v>

81
00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:19.661
<v Speaker 2>here's the deal.</v>

82
00:02:19.661 --> 00:02:20.081
<v Speaker 2>Honestly,</v>

83
00:02:20.081 --> 00:02:20.920
<v Speaker 2>we know what,</v>

84
00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.660
<v Speaker 2>what moves on a regular basis.</v>

85
00:02:22.661 --> 00:02:22.841
<v Speaker 2>If it,</v>

86
00:02:22.841 --> 00:02:24.280
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't preclude things from,</v>

87
00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:25.330
<v Speaker 2>from moving on,</v>

88
00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.690
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

89
00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:26.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

90
00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.010
<v Speaker 2>unique basis.</v>

91
00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.530
<v Speaker 2>There could be some fucking new shit that happens anyway.</v>

92
00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.861
<v Speaker 2>We don't,</v>

93
00:02:29.861 --> 00:02:31.000
<v Speaker 2>we don't have this shit wired.</v>

94
00:02:31.001 --> 00:02:32.200
<v Speaker 2>We don't know what the hell is going on.</v>

95
00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.320
<v Speaker 2>There's some recent study with these scientists are going to drill into the</v>

96
00:02:35.321 --> 00:02:38.080
<v Speaker 2>earth's mantle all the way through the fucking core.</v>

97
00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.390
<v Speaker 2>It's going to take five to try to figure out how to do it.</v>

98
00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.100
<v Speaker 2>It's like they're like little kids.</v>

99
00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.761
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

100
00:02:42.761 --> 00:02:45.370
<v Speaker 2>well we know we can't use a regular drill because it'll melt,</v>

101
00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.761
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

102
00:02:45.761 --> 00:02:48.400
<v Speaker 2>so they're trying to figure out how the fuck they're going to get a drill.</v>

103
00:02:48.401 --> 00:02:50.740
<v Speaker 2>The drills all the way down to the mat and you ask them why,</v>

104
00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:51.280
<v Speaker 2>what are you doing?</v>

105
00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.641
<v Speaker 2>You're going to,</v>

106
00:02:51.641 --> 00:02:52.990
<v Speaker 2>is there a leprechauns down there?</v>

107
00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:54.190
<v Speaker 2>They're going to give you gold.</v>

108
00:02:54.191 --> 00:02:55.570
<v Speaker 2>What's going on is they're aliens down there.</v>

109
00:02:55.571 --> 00:02:56.440
<v Speaker 2>They're going to suck your Dick.</v>

110
00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:57.423
<v Speaker 2>What are you doing?</v>

111
00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:58.960
<v Speaker 2>Why are you drilling down to the mantle?</v>

112
00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.990
<v Speaker 2>Because people are silly fucks and we just want to see what's up.</v>

113
00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:03.100
<v Speaker 2>We just want to see what's up.</v>

114
00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:04.410
<v Speaker 2>We want to try what's up.</v>

115
00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:05.530
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes you got to dig a hole.</v>

116
00:03:05.531 --> 00:03:06.364
<v Speaker 2>The fun stuff.</v>

117
00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

118
00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:07.930
<v Speaker 2>but what the fuck man?</v>

119
00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:11.200
<v Speaker 2>What if they dig a hole through the earth mantle and the earth becomes like a</v>

120
00:03:11.201 --> 00:03:14.170
<v Speaker 2>fucking balloon with a hole in it and just goes flying around the galaxy?</v>

121
00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:17.470
<v Speaker 2>What if it lava shoots out of it like she like a balloon.</v>

122
00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.480
<v Speaker 2>You know how you go and your blow the balloon,</v>

123
00:03:19.481 --> 00:03:20.314
<v Speaker 2>then you let it go.</v>

124
00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:21.580
<v Speaker 2>How about that?</v>

125
00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:22.900
<v Speaker 2>What if the earth becomes like that?</v>

126
00:03:22.901 --> 00:03:26.980
<v Speaker 2>Like a balloon that doesn't does not tied off at the end and the earth flies</v>

127
00:03:26.981 --> 00:03:27.814
<v Speaker 2>around the galaxy.</v>

128
00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.820
<v Speaker 2>I'll fucking haphazardly like a balloon.</v>

129
00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:31.571
<v Speaker 2>What did we find out?</v>

130
00:03:31.571 --> 00:03:35.950
<v Speaker 2>The earth is really made out of rubber and this whole mantle and all this other</v>

131
00:03:35.951 --> 00:03:36.431
<v Speaker 2>bullshit.</v>

132
00:03:36.431 --> 00:03:38.020
<v Speaker 2>This is just outside the balloon.</v>

133
00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:39.910
<v Speaker 2>This is like the decoration on the balloon,</v>

134
00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:44.380
<v Speaker 2>but if you pop that mother fucker it was just fly around Jupiter.</v>

135
00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:45.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

136
00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.510
<v Speaker 2>we slamming a Jupiter and shit and we slam it.</v>

137
00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:48.373
<v Speaker 2>Other planets,</v>

138
00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.850
<v Speaker 2>that's is the most fucked up thing about spaces that occasionally planets hit</v>

139
00:03:51.851 --> 00:03:52.684
<v Speaker 2>each other.</v>

140
00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:54.340
<v Speaker 2>God Damn Son.</v>

141
00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:59.170
<v Speaker 2>Could you imagine what kind of chaos there would be in this world if we saw a</v>

142
00:03:59.171 --> 00:04:00.850
<v Speaker 2>planet common our way,</v>

143
00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.480
<v Speaker 2>if you saw a Mars like for sure Mars is coming,</v>

144
00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:05.890
<v Speaker 2>it might take five years,</v>

145
00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:07.730
<v Speaker 2>but it's going to hit the earth and we're fucked in.</v>

146
00:04:07.731 --> 00:04:09.730
<v Speaker 2>There's not a God damn thing we can do to stop it.</v>

147
00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:10.301
<v Speaker 2>There it is.</v>

148
00:04:10.301 --> 00:04:12.310
<v Speaker 2>You see it in the sky gets a little bigger every night.</v>

149
00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.110
<v Speaker 2>By the time it got real close,</v>

150
00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:17.540
<v Speaker 2>people would be losing their fucking mind.</v>

151
00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:19.210
<v Speaker 2>It'd be fucking great.</v>

152
00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:20.360
<v Speaker 2>It wouldn't be a party,</v>

153
00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:21.203
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

154
00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:23.170
<v Speaker 2>warrior with knives and stabbing people.</v>

155
00:04:23.171 --> 00:04:25.990
<v Speaker 2>It would be like that scene in event horizon.</v>

156
00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:29.080
<v Speaker 2>You remember that movie event horizon with Laurence Fishburne?</v>

157
00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:32.140
<v Speaker 2>You don't remember that Badass fucking science fiction movie.</v>

158
00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:37.280
<v Speaker 2>Sam Shepard and I think it's Sam Shepard and Laurence Fishburne and it's about a</v>

159
00:04:37.281 --> 00:04:40.870
<v Speaker 2>of spaceship that punches a hole through a wormhole.</v>

160
00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:45.280
<v Speaker 2>They traveled to a distant part in the galaxy by folding the space and time</v>

161
00:04:45.281 --> 00:04:46.000
<v Speaker 2>together,</v>

162
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.260
<v Speaker 2>like two pieces of paper,</v>

163
00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:48.570
<v Speaker 2>punching a hole through it in a,</v>

164
00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:50.230
<v Speaker 2>in a arriving on the other end.</v>

165
00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:51.071
<v Speaker 2>But when they did that,</v>

166
00:04:51.071 --> 00:04:53.230
<v Speaker 2>they didn't realize that they actually went to hell.</v>

167
00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:56.710
<v Speaker 2>So these guys get to this,</v>

168
00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:57.100
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

169
00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:58.480
<v Speaker 2>event horizon ship.</v>

170
00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:59.500
<v Speaker 2>It comes back,</v>

171
00:04:59.501 --> 00:05:00.370
<v Speaker 2>everyone's dead,</v>

172
00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:01.870
<v Speaker 2>and they get a video of a,</v>

173
00:05:01.871 --> 00:05:02.010
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

174
00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:02.220
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

175
00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:03.280
<v Speaker 2>the crew and the,</v>

176
00:05:03.281 --> 00:05:03.581
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

177
00:05:03.581 --> 00:05:03.791
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

178
00:05:03.791 --> 00:05:04.750
<v Speaker 2>the captain and everything.</v>

179
00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:07.810
<v Speaker 2>Like they find out later in the movie what happened to them and they're pulling</v>

180
00:05:07.811 --> 00:05:11.600
<v Speaker 2>their own eyeballs out and scream and shit and Latin and killing each other and</v>

181
00:05:11.601 --> 00:05:13.930
<v Speaker 2>biting each other apart and cotton each other open.</v>

182
00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:15.220
<v Speaker 2>That's what it's going to look like.</v>

183
00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:16.251
<v Speaker 2>It's not gonna be like,</v>

184
00:05:16.251 --> 00:05:16.661
<v Speaker 2>everyone's like,</v>

185
00:05:16.661 --> 00:05:17.051

<v Speaker 2>You're not going to be fucking okay.</v>

188
00:05:19.181 --> 00:05:20.800
<v Speaker 2>When there's bars,</v>

189
00:05:20.801 --> 00:05:23.590
<v Speaker 2>it's like a hundred times bigger than the moon.</v>

190
00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:25.060
<v Speaker 2>Maybe a thousand to,</v>

191
00:05:25.061 --> 00:05:25.451
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

194
00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:27.880
<v Speaker 2>I think I would fucking kill myself.</v>

195
00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:31.390
<v Speaker 2>I would close my fucking eyes and wish for the best.</v>

196
00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:33.380

<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

234
00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:25.911
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting.</v>

235
00:06:25.911 --> 00:06:29.150
<v Speaker 2>People didn't really learn about human behavior from the Rodney king riots,</v>

236
00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:30.410
<v Speaker 2>but that's what should have taught you.</v>

237
00:06:30.411 --> 00:06:35.411
<v Speaker 2>This is what's possible with something so simple as a verdict for someone who</v>

238
00:06:35.991 --> 00:06:39.770
<v Speaker 2>you don't even know who you saw get beat up and they let the cops go,</v>

239
00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:42.710
<v Speaker 2>and these mother fuckers were going crazy,</v>

240
00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:44.900
<v Speaker 2>throwing rocks at white people.</v>

241

<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

245
00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:49.370
<v Speaker 2>It was a racially charged issue.</v>

246
00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:52.010
<v Speaker 2>I understand that people have this feeling of a,</v>

247
00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:54.470
<v Speaker 2>an unfair society and it's set up.</v>
