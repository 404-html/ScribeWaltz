00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.910
<v Speaker 1>Now most people in America consider </v>
<v Speaker 1>Calabasas to be one of the safest places</v>

5
00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:14.970
<v Speaker 1>as where the Kardashians chose to live.</v>

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.450
<v Speaker 1>Bunch of spiders you have that'll kill </v>
<v Speaker 1>you instantly.</v>

11
00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:29.390

<v Speaker 1>You got crocodiles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've,</v>

13
00:00:30.981 --> 00:00:35.880
<v Speaker 1>you've bathed where I've saw the video </v>
<v Speaker 1>of you and campaigns in a fucking puddle</v>

14
00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:41.240
<v Speaker 1>that crocodile swim around in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yet the one day he's in Calabasas,</v>

15
00:00:43.801 --> 00:00:46.180
<v Speaker 1>which is like the safest place in </v>
<v Speaker 1>America on true.</v>

16
00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.770
<v Speaker 1>But yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well tell me what happened.</v>

17
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:50.933
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'll hop down to the hotel first </v>

18
00:00:52.141 --> 00:00:52.974
<v Speaker 2>thing this morning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the gun trying to find a decent coffee </v>

19
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.660
<v Speaker 2>here in America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

20
00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.440
<v Speaker 2>the police surrounded the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole area where the,</v>

21
00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:03.270
<v Speaker 2>the coffee shop was and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had guns drawn and everything.</v>

22
00:01:03.271 --> 00:01:04.104
<v Speaker 2>And then I heard later that someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually had a gun out and they might </v>

23
00:01:06.141 --> 00:01:08.550
<v Speaker 2>have even been shots fired.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

24
00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:09.840
<v Speaker 2>Crazy stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I'm like,</v>

25
00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:10.030
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

26
00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:11.440
<v Speaker 1>at a coffee bean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

27
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.670
<v Speaker 1>It was at a coffee bean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

28
00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:15.730
<v Speaker 1>Find out what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie.</v>

29
00:01:15.731 --> 00:01:16.564
<v Speaker 1>See if there's a story we can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said it was probably like some wife </v>

30
00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:23.200
<v Speaker 1>mad at her husband.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's seamless series called the police.</v>

31
00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:25.360
<v Speaker 1>He's got a gun like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's happened before.</v>

32
00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:26.463
<v Speaker 1>That happened with Ron White.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think his girlfriend packed a gun in </v>

33
00:01:28.871 --> 00:01:32.920
<v Speaker 1>his luggage and then that happened with </v>
<v Speaker 1>Sam Kennison to his girlfriend,</v>

34
00:01:32.921 --> 00:01:36.280
<v Speaker 1>packed a loaded gun in his luggage and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then call the police on him.</v>

35
00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.200
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Straight away.</v>

36
00:01:38.201 --> 00:01:39.034
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's safer in the mountains with the </v>

37
00:01:40.361 --> 00:01:41.194
<v Speaker 1>grizzly bears and crap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He is definitely not safer if you </v>

38
00:01:48.401 --> 00:01:49.234
<v Speaker 1>actually run into a grizzly bear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for the most part it's pretty </v>

39
00:01:51.191 --> 00:01:52.024
<v Speaker 1>peaceful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

40
00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:53.613
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most people are worried about grizzly </v>

41
00:01:54.461 --> 00:01:56.560
<v Speaker 1>bears,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you could be around him for days and</v>

42
00:01:56.561 --> 00:01:59.410
<v Speaker 1>days and most likely nothing's going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>

43
00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.150
<v Speaker 2>Most likely most likely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when you,</v>

44
00:02:03.151 --> 00:02:04.030
<v Speaker 2>when you were up there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

45
00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.570
<v Speaker 2>Did you run into some walls?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

46
00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:06.630
<v Speaker 2>We say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

47
00:02:06.631 --> 00:02:08.590
<v Speaker 2>I seen wolves and then the grizzly </v>
<v Speaker 2>bears,</v>

48
00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.100
<v Speaker 2>the one that sort of really scared me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

49
00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:12.373
<v Speaker 2>I had a handgun out and I actually had </v>
<v Speaker 2>the drawer that handgun a few times </v>

50
00:02:14.581 --> 00:02:16.350
<v Speaker 2>while I was up in the mountains.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

51
00:02:16.351 --> 00:02:17.184
<v Speaker 2>there was one real big grizzly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like size 11 boots that I'm coming </v>

52
00:02:20.461 --> 00:02:22.310
<v Speaker 2>around camp and was hunting all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>trials.</v>

53
00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.160
<v Speaker 1>11 boots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like a 12 foot by 12 inch pad.</v>

54
00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:27.570
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

55
00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:29.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How big do you think it was?</v>

56
00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:31.110
<v Speaker 1>Did you see the actual bar itself?</v>

57
00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So once I actually killed the bull,</v>

58
00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.820
<v Speaker 2>which was about day 10 or 11,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was sleeping on the caucus,</v>

59
00:02:37.821 --> 00:02:38.654
<v Speaker 2>about 60 meters from it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was sleeping in your car and then he </v>

60
00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.960
<v Speaker 2>slept on to eat some of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't touch it.</v>

61
00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:45.821
<v Speaker 2>What's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

62
00:02:45.821 --> 00:02:47.210
<v Speaker 2>it was like the first day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>

63
00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:48.223
<v Speaker 2>So I killed that bull in the afternoon a</v>
<v Speaker 2>packed out a decent load of meat that </v>

64
00:02:51.861 --> 00:02:53.600
<v Speaker 2>night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Went back in the morning,</v>

65
00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:57.550
<v Speaker 2>the next morning to pack out the rest of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the meat and was going in there looking,</v>

66
00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.320
<v Speaker 2>thinking they could be a bear on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>caucus.</v>

67
00:02:59.321 --> 00:03:00.154
<v Speaker 2>And sure enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I seem to be a brown hair in the creek </v>

68
00:03:02.561 --> 00:03:04.780
<v Speaker 2>bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he's just sleeping,</v>

69
00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:05.763
<v Speaker 2>just sleeping there and so I yelled at </v>
<v Speaker 2>him a prick disease up and had a look </v>

70
00:03:09.821 --> 00:03:13.900
<v Speaker 2>around and I yelled at him the second </v>
<v Speaker 2>time and he jumped up and he disappeared</v>

71
00:03:13.901 --> 00:03:16.450
<v Speaker 2>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like scary.</v>

72
00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.400
<v Speaker 2>That's how quickie this is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thick timber,</v>

73
00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.850
<v Speaker 2>lot of deadfall and everything and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>just disappeared for that.</v>

74
00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:23.193
<v Speaker 2>And it actually got me thinking that if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you didn't see a bear coming from a </v>

75
00:03:26.201 --> 00:03:27.280
<v Speaker 2>distance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>handgun,</v>

76
00:03:27.281 --> 00:03:28.750
<v Speaker 2>bedspread,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever you've got,</v>

77
00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.370
<v Speaker 2>you'd be in serious trouble because he </v>
<v Speaker 2>just left that scene dead quiet and in a</v>

78
00:03:33.371 --> 00:03:34.204
<v Speaker 2>flash I think can move so fast and those</v>
<v Speaker 2>pads that they have on the bottoms of </v>

79
00:03:37.481 --> 00:03:40.170
<v Speaker 2>their feet and makes him so sad and </v>
<v Speaker 2>quiet.</v>

80
00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:41.023
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you would think that a thousand </v>

81
00:03:42.611 --> 00:03:44.510
<v Speaker 2>pound animal wouldn't be able to move </v>
<v Speaker 2>that forward.</v>

82
00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:47.310
<v Speaker 2>So I'm strapping meat to my pack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

83
00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:50.230
<v Speaker 2>obviously there's always a blind spot </v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're hunched over.</v>

84
00:03:50.231 --> 00:03:51.064
<v Speaker 2>And it took me three times longer to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>the meat on my path because I was just </v>

85
00:03:53.891 --> 00:03:54.724
<v Speaker 2>constantly looking over waiting for that</v>
<v Speaker 2>beer to come back because I haven't </v>

86
00:03:56.471 --> 00:03:58.390
<v Speaker 2>actually been to the carcass again yet.</v>

87
00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:02.920
<v Speaker 2>I've seen the bear on the way back in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pretty scary.</v>

88
00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:04.450
<v Speaker 2>How big was it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Giant.</v>

89
00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:06.430
<v Speaker 2>Big.</v>
<v Speaker 2>11.</v>

90
00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:09.610
<v Speaker 2>Eleven feet tall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Scary.</v>

91
00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:13.710
<v Speaker 2>You're alone at deep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>deep,</v>

92
00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:14.553
<v Speaker 2>deep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was talking to the fish and game </v>

93
00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:18.093
<v Speaker 2>warden in the area and the big grizzly </v>
<v Speaker 2>had gone into another hunters' camp on </v>

94
00:04:21.911 --> 00:04:24.520
<v Speaker 2>the mountain and just absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 2>destroyed these camp.</v>

95
00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:27.580
<v Speaker 2>Now I don't know if it was the same bear</v>
<v Speaker 2>or different bear,</v>

96
00:04:27.581 --> 00:04:28.414
<v Speaker 2>but on three occasions a big brown bear </v>
<v Speaker 2>or grizzly come back into my camp and </v>

97
00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:35.620
<v Speaker 2>each night that he'd come in he'd get a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little bit closer.</v>

98
00:04:35.621 --> 00:04:38.710
<v Speaker 2>So the first 90 circled camp about 50,</v>
<v Speaker 2>60 meters away.</v>

99
00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:42.100
<v Speaker 2>The next 90 circled camp,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about 30 meters away.</v>

100
00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.480
<v Speaker 2>And the third time he came in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he come right into the back of camp like</v>

101
00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:48.760
<v Speaker 2>15 meters away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let out these gnarly growl.</v>

102
00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:50.003
<v Speaker 2>And at this point my buddy grant </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hughes's come in to help me pack out </v>

103
00:04:52.631 --> 00:04:53.320
<v Speaker 2>some neat.</v>

104
00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:55.710
<v Speaker 2>He's in his tent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm in my tent when there's here.</v>

105
00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:58.990
<v Speaker 2>This bear walking in for the snow and </v>
<v Speaker 2>lets out a growl.</v>

106
00:04:58.991 --> 00:05:01.750
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want to go like grant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you hear that?</v>

107
00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:03.190
<v Speaker 2>Or Grant?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a beer in camp.</v>

108
00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:05.950
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want to let the buyer know that</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm in the tent man.</v>

109
00:05:05.951 --> 00:05:07.300
<v Speaker 2>I just laid there dead,</v>
<v Speaker 2>quiet.</v>

110
00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.850
<v Speaker 2>I had the handgun sitting on my chest </v>
<v Speaker 2>loaded,</v>

111
00:05:09.851 --> 00:05:14.530
<v Speaker 2>ready to go and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I laid awake for like three hours,</v>

112
00:05:14.531 --> 00:05:15.364
<v Speaker 2>like you heard the beer walk off and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>laid awake for three hours and I'd get </v>

113
00:05:17.981 --> 00:05:19.330
<v Speaker 2>up in the morning and I'm do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

114
00:05:19.331 --> 00:05:20.470

115
00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:21.850
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did I hear the bear?</v>

116
00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:23.790
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want to move on,</v>

117
00:05:23.791 --> 00:05:26.080
<v Speaker 2>make a sandy had the same idea as me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Didn't want to give away.</v>

118
00:05:26.081 --> 00:05:27.910
<v Speaker 2>He's location.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

119
00:05:27.911 --> 00:05:29.860
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it took me three hours to get to sleep.</v>

120
00:05:29.861 --> 00:05:30.694
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sleep,</v>

121
00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:33.700
<v Speaker 2>you got fucking sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck?</v>

122
00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:34.931
<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hell,</v>

123
00:05:34.931 --> 00:05:36.860
<v Speaker 2>pissed off man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He laid awake all night.</v>

124
00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:39.770
<v Speaker 2>It's like a tent burrito.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

125
00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.670
<v Speaker 2>Burrito.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even staying warm in your sleeping bag,</v>

126
00:05:42.671 --> 00:05:43.504
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like he's got to be able to smell you </v>

127
00:05:44.231 --> 00:05:45.480
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They must know you're your.</v>

128
00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:47.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What a wondering if they were,</v>

129
00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:48.753
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they smell you and then they smell </v>

130
00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:51.333
<v Speaker 2>the meat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they would be more attracted to </v>

131
00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:54.120
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't recognize.</v>

132
00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:55.063
<v Speaker 2>Smell real good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so hopefully I bet they liked things </v>

133
00:05:57.741 --> 00:05:58.100
<v Speaker 2>that don't</v>

134
00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:59.150
<v Speaker 3>smell good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I probably do.</v>

135
00:05:59.151 --> 00:06:01.580
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mate was hanging up probably a good mall</v>

136
00:06:01.581 --> 00:06:02.414
<v Speaker 3>from camp at like a because we were out </v>
<v Speaker 3>a few different drop points because it </v>

137
00:06:05.041 --> 00:06:07.310
<v Speaker 3>was such a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was four days hike out of meat,</v>

138
00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:08.473
<v Speaker 3>so we had different drop points along </v>
<v Speaker 3>the way and I never wanted to take any </v>

139
00:06:10.581 --> 00:06:13.070
<v Speaker 3>meat and the campus set for what I'd be </v>
<v Speaker 3>eating each night,</v>

140
00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:15.950
<v Speaker 3>which a cooked meat might smell pretty </v>
<v Speaker 3>good to a bear,</v>

141
00:06:15.951 --> 00:06:18.650
<v Speaker 3>but I was more concerned about the scent</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

142
00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:19.523
<v Speaker 3>that we will be carrying on our boots </v>
<v Speaker 3>from meat site to meet site and then </v>

143
00:06:22.341 --> 00:06:23.174
<v Speaker 3>walk them back in the camp.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that Bayer had already been in the </v>

144
00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:26.423
<v Speaker 3>campaign.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He knew where we were and he was doing </v>

145
00:06:27.531 --> 00:06:28.364
<v Speaker 3>his rounds obviously every night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you done an adventure like this </v>

146
00:06:31.041 --> 00:06:31.874
<v Speaker 3>before?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is an epic adventure because you </v>

147
00:06:32.871 --> 00:06:34.590
<v Speaker 3>went to Montana,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

148
00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:35.930
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you parked.</v>

149
00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:38.060
<v Speaker 3>And then how many miles did you go deep </v>
<v Speaker 3>into the woods?</v>

150
00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:40.370
<v Speaker 3>I was probably about 12 miles in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>end.</v>

151
00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:42.830
<v Speaker 3>That's no trials or anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Twelve miles.</v>

152
00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:43.783
<v Speaker 3>Twelve miles into Montana.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Montana is if you folks who have never </v>

153
00:06:47.601 --> 00:06:52.601
<v Speaker 3>visited Montana is one of the most </v>
<v Speaker 3>unspoiled parts of America,</v>

154
00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:56.080
<v Speaker 3>like below Alaska,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but not far below.</v>

155
00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:57.643
<v Speaker 3>So you're already super remote,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like we're already a long way from </v>

156
00:06:59.781 --> 00:07:03.200
<v Speaker 3>anywhere and parked at a trail head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then.</v>

157
00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:04.093
<v Speaker 3>So obviously I had 11 days solo by </v>
<v Speaker 3>myself and then my buddy grant come in </v>

158
00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:07.863
<v Speaker 3>and help me pack that bullet out a ended</v>
<v Speaker 3>up being 14 days in the end by the time </v>

159
00:07:11.781 --> 00:07:13.760
<v Speaker 3>we got the meat out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

160
00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:14.653
<v Speaker 3>it's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've done done similar adventures </v>

161
00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:17.443
<v Speaker 3>because a lot of hung back home in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Australia is all super remote so I'm 90 </v>

162
00:07:22.521 --> 00:07:25.130
<v Speaker 3>percent of it's back country really back</v>
<v Speaker 3>home.</v>

163
00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:27.470
<v Speaker 3>But it's a different kind of back </v>
<v Speaker 3>country.</v>

164
00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:29.910
<v Speaker 3>It's sort of back country bears.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

165
00:07:29.911 --> 00:07:30.744
<v Speaker 3>it definitely is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This was saw low minimal gear because </v>

166
00:07:33.771 --> 00:07:35.930
<v Speaker 3>everything's in your backpack that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got for the hunt.</v>

167
00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:37.063
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's super light and you're cutting </v>

168
00:07:38.481 --> 00:07:40.280
<v Speaker 3>down on a lot of essentials that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>need,</v>

169
00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:41.240
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>

170
00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:43.460
<v Speaker 3>just to get back in there when you do </v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

171
00:07:43.461 --> 00:07:46.970
<v Speaker 3>I've been obsessed with a lightweight </v>
<v Speaker 3>backpacking lately.</v>

172
00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:49.530
<v Speaker 3>I've been paying attention to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

173
00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:52.190
<v Speaker 3>these guys that do the Appalachian </v>
<v Speaker 3>trail.</v>

174
00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:53.173
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did they hike from Georgia all the way </v>

175
00:07:56.331 --> 00:07:58.250
<v Speaker 3>up to Maine?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It takes five months.</v>

176
00:07:58.370 --> 00:07:59.960
<v Speaker 3>That's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're insane.</v>

177
00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:00.823
<v Speaker 3>But it's one of those things that </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a real problem with the human </v>

178
00:08:02.931 --> 00:08:03.764
<v Speaker 3>brain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like we were talking about our pal </v>

179
00:08:04.491 --> 00:08:07.490
<v Speaker 3>campaigns and this a 200 mile run he </v>
<v Speaker 3>just did.</v>

180
00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:10.400
<v Speaker 3>And when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when there's a challenge in front of you</v>

181
00:08:10.401 --> 00:08:12.710
<v Speaker 3>and you find out that someone has done </v>
<v Speaker 3>it before you start going,</v>

182
00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:14.720
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe I could do 200 miles.</v>

183
00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:18.170
<v Speaker 3>You feel like there's something fucked </v>
<v Speaker 3>up about people's brains where when they</v>

184
00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:19.033
<v Speaker 3>find that someone's doing something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I have zero desire to take five </v>

185
00:08:22.011 --> 00:08:25.400
<v Speaker 3>months out of my life and walk from </v>
<v Speaker 3>Georgia to Maine.</v>

186
00:08:25.401 --> 00:08:27.350
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I bet you once you got it done,</v>

187
00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:30.230
<v Speaker 3>that's the difference.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But part of my brain was like,</v>

188
00:08:31.130 --> 00:08:33.260
<v Speaker 3>I started thinking about it and then my </v>
<v Speaker 3>shut up,</v>

189
00:08:33.261 --> 00:08:34.094
<v Speaker 3>stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not fucking hiking to main stop </v>

190
00:08:36.681 --> 00:08:37.514
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but part of me was like listening to </v>

191
00:08:39.111 --> 00:08:41.090
<v Speaker 3>this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was on,</v>

192
00:08:41.091 --> 00:08:42.260
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the rich outdoors.</v>

193
00:08:42.261 --> 00:08:44.540
<v Speaker 3>You've done research projects for his </v>
<v Speaker 3>podcast.</v>

194
00:08:44.541 --> 00:08:46.890
<v Speaker 3>One of his buddies is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

195
00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:47.733
<v Speaker 3>a trail guy and they were talking about </v>
<v Speaker 3>like lightweight gear and how they </v>

196
00:08:50.301 --> 00:08:51.134
<v Speaker 3>can't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they pack the different stream where a </v>

197
00:08:52.461 --> 00:08:54.940
<v Speaker 3>guy uses for hunting and what someone </v>
<v Speaker 3>uses for a,</v>

198
00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:56.610
<v Speaker 3>just these long,</v>

199
00:08:56.610 --> 00:08:57.151
<v Speaker 1>long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>long,</v>

200
00:08:57.151 --> 00:09:01.200
<v Speaker 1>long hikes where they essentially were </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same clothes for five months.</v>

201
00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:03.010
<v Speaker 1>That's the hygienic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

202
00:09:03.130 --> 00:09:04.020
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't seem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

203
00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:07.860
<v Speaker 1>I mean I guess maybe get a chance </v>
<v Speaker 1>occasionally to wash them somewhere,</v>

204
00:09:07.861 --> 00:09:08.694
<v Speaker 1>but they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything is the lightest possible </v>

205
00:09:11.491 --> 00:09:15.240
<v Speaker 1>stuff that you could have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you do this,</v>

206
00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:16.800
<v Speaker 1>let's say if you're going to go out </v>
<v Speaker 1>there and you're,</v>

207
00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:19.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're planning on how many days?</v>

208
00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:20.663
<v Speaker 2>15.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to do at least half the month </v>

209
00:09:22.231 --> 00:09:25.740
<v Speaker 2>in Montana and I wanted to do the other </v>
<v Speaker 2>half of the month in Idaho.</v>

210
00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:29.310
<v Speaker 2>So 15 days and a little bit of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>trips.</v>

211
00:09:29.311 --> 00:09:33.490
<v Speaker 2>Got To be unprepared in that sense when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're doing 15 days it,</v>

212
00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:36.810
<v Speaker 2>that sort of hunt because the country's </v>
<v Speaker 2>like straight up and down.</v>

213
00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:38.910
<v Speaker 2>There's no other way to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no,</v>

214
00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:40.013
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to drive to the ridge line or </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to walk a decent trail that I </v>

215
00:09:41.791 --> 00:09:44.820
<v Speaker 2>reach line or take an atv and it's just </v>
<v Speaker 2>all on foot,</v>

216
00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:47.550
<v Speaker 2>straight up and down country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

217
00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:50.820
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and to have a little bit of roughness to</v>

218
00:09:50.821 --> 00:09:52.110
<v Speaker 2>a trip like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

219
00:09:52.111 --> 00:09:52.944
<v Speaker 2>we yar roughing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a bit of the appeal as well and </v>

220
00:09:56.221 --> 00:09:57.720
<v Speaker 2>the experience in doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

221
00:09:58.190 --> 00:10:01.560
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just talking with the guys at hoyt</v>

222
00:10:01.561 --> 00:10:02.394
<v Speaker 2>and they'll ask him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the essentials that you had in </v>

223
00:10:04.771 --> 00:10:06.160
<v Speaker 2>your pack that you wouldn't go without?</v>

224
00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:07.043
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well how about I tell you about the </v>

225
00:10:07.471 --> 00:10:10.920
<v Speaker 2>stuff that I wish I had in my pack and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I didn't go out.</v>

226
00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:14.940
<v Speaker 2>Like what stuff do you wish I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't take any rain gear and I didn't</v>

227
00:10:14.941 --> 00:10:15.774
<v Speaker 2>take any rain gear and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I didn't check the weather before I </v>

228
00:10:17.731 --> 00:10:21.390
<v Speaker 2>went in deliberately because I didn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>want any deterrent on the trip.</v>

229
00:10:21.391 --> 00:10:21.761
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

230
00:10:21.761 --> 00:10:23.310
<v Speaker 2>it's going to snow or it's going to high</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little.</v>

231
00:10:23.311 --> 00:10:26.520
<v Speaker 2>There's going to be gale force winds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I shouldn't go in today or I should pack</v>

232
00:10:26.521 --> 00:10:29.970
<v Speaker 2>this extra.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just wanted to ignore all that.</v>

233
00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:30.923
<v Speaker 2>Just go in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just live in the wilderness basically </v>

234
00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:34.850
<v Speaker 2>with the minimal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

235
00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:38.760
<v Speaker 2>I got all that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether I've got hail three times.</v>

236
00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:42.330
<v Speaker 2>I got gale force winds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got rain followed by snow,</v>

237
00:10:42.331 --> 00:10:43.164
<v Speaker 2>so soaking wet then freezing cold and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you just had to stay active the whole </v>

238
00:10:47.581 --> 00:10:50.730
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I'd literally get to a mountain and</v>

239
00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:51.743
<v Speaker 2>I'd sit down for two minutes and you'd </v>
<v Speaker 2>go from sweating to freezing cold </v>

240
00:10:55.141 --> 00:10:59.430
<v Speaker 2>because you're wet and actually hiked </v>
<v Speaker 2>the mountain just to get warm.</v>

241
00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:01.650
<v Speaker 2>Were you wearing wool?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nah,</v>

242
00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:03.000
<v Speaker 2>whole synthetics.</v>

243
00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:04.423
<v Speaker 1>So since the synthetics in some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in some cases it's harder to maintain </v>

244
00:11:08.901 --> 00:11:11.450
<v Speaker 1>your body temperature when you sweat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's probably.</v>

245
00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:13.100
<v Speaker 1>And perks to both.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

246
00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:14.383
<v Speaker 2>So like I've got a synthetic sleeping </v>
<v Speaker 2>bag as well at why is it a little bit </v>

247
00:11:17.721 --> 00:11:18.554
<v Speaker 2>more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I could jump in that sleeping bag </v>

248
00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:22.670
<v Speaker 2>wet at night and wake up in the morning </v>
<v Speaker 2>and dry.</v>

249
00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:27.740
<v Speaker 2>That's a little bit of the difference </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it will dry out the next day and uh,</v>

250
00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:28.633
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>never carries any weight your </v>

251
00:11:30.351 --> 00:11:33.080
<v Speaker 2>synthetics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I just had like a small,</v>

252
00:11:33.081 --> 00:11:33.914
<v Speaker 2>a Hoodie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little hoodie and I had some </v>

253
00:11:36.291 --> 00:11:38.870
<v Speaker 2>undergarments and that was about it for </v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole trip.</v>

254
00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:42.500
<v Speaker 1>But as far as like sweating and your </v>
<v Speaker 1>clothes and getting your stuff wet,</v>

255
00:11:42.530 --> 00:11:44.960
<v Speaker 1>wool maintains body temperature better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It does,</v>

256
00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:45.450
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

257
00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:46.171
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it does.</v>

258
00:11:46.171 --> 00:11:50.070
<v Speaker 2>Next the skin is really good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like under armour has got some really</v>

259
00:11:50.071 --> 00:11:53.370
<v Speaker 2>good next to skin clothing and I'll get </v>
<v Speaker 2>wedding that next.</v>

260
00:11:53.371 --> 00:11:55.450
<v Speaker 2>The skin clothing and stay warm because </v>
<v Speaker 2>it is,</v>

261
00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:56.583
<v Speaker 2>it's similar to a wet suit wear suits </v>
<v Speaker 2>designed to have some liquid in it and </v>

262
00:12:01.001 --> 00:12:02.860
<v Speaker 2>the liquid gets warm and keeps your body</v>
<v Speaker 2>warm.</v>

263
00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:04.023
<v Speaker 2>That next to skin clothings the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>where it's sitting right on your skin </v>

264
00:12:06.521 --> 00:12:09.700
<v Speaker 2>and it's going to stay warm like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was it like a spandex almost.</v>

265
00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:10.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>

266
00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:15.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looks a bit Pansy when you grow up in</v>

267
00:12:16.141 --> 00:12:17.270
<v Speaker 2>Rhode and tights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

268
00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:18.580
<v Speaker 2>So that was a fuck up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

269
00:12:18.581 --> 00:12:19.960
<v Speaker 2>You should have probably brought some </v>
<v Speaker 2>rain gear.</v>

270
00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:20.853
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to call it a fuck up </v>

271
00:12:22.061 --> 00:12:24.640
<v Speaker 2>because I delivered it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Deliberately done it.</v>

272
00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:27.480
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to kate white down so much wheat.</v>

273
00:12:27.490 --> 00:12:31.210
<v Speaker 2>This is like a lightweight rain Poncho.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

274
00:12:31.510 --> 00:12:36.130
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to know how it was really </v>
<v Speaker 2>heavy and I couldn't carry.</v>

275
00:12:36.131 --> 00:12:39.220
<v Speaker 2>It seems like it's not that day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but where do you stop?</v>

276
00:12:39.310 --> 00:12:41.860
<v Speaker 2>Where do you stop doing that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is the big question,</v>

277
00:12:41.861 --> 00:12:42.311
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

278
00:12:42.311 --> 00:12:43.091
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's weird.</v>

279
00:12:43.091 --> 00:12:43.924
<v Speaker 2>You stop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was already walking in going this </v>

280
00:12:45.581 --> 00:12:47.440
<v Speaker 2>is killer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like this is hurting.</v>

281
00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:49.570
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how heavy is your pack?</v>

282
00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:52.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't get into that sort of stuff.</v>

283
00:12:52.450 --> 00:12:53.350
<v Speaker 2>You don't wear it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nope.</v>

284
00:12:53.550 --> 00:12:54.520
<v Speaker 2>I don't why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

285
00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:55.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just go silent.</v>

286
00:12:56.060 --> 00:12:56.893
<v Speaker 2>Sirens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A food.</v>

287
00:12:57.010 --> 00:12:58.240
<v Speaker 2>I'll just go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a dinner,</v>

288
00:12:58.310 --> 00:13:01.600
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's some lunchtime snacks now.</v>

289
00:13:01.970 --> 00:13:02.980
<v Speaker 2>Energy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's it.</v>

290
00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:05.740
<v Speaker 2>If you go in for 15 days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many days were the food?</v>

291
00:13:05.741 --> 00:13:06.574
<v Speaker 2>Do you care?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I only took in 10 because I was killing </v>

292
00:13:10.361 --> 00:13:12.100
<v Speaker 2>a bull roast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

293
00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:14.800
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

294
00:13:15.190 --> 00:13:18.010
<v Speaker 2>I didn't run out because I shot a grouse</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I cooked the grass up.</v>

295
00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:18.993
<v Speaker 2>Then I killed my bowl and I was eating </v>
<v Speaker 2>meat and I was even cooking meat and </v>

296
00:13:21.821 --> 00:13:23.950
<v Speaker 2>then packing it the next day to eat </v>
<v Speaker 2>cold,</v>

297
00:13:24.250 --> 00:13:27.460
<v Speaker 2>which obviously helped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's A.</v>

298
00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:29.680
<v Speaker 2>Have you heard this story about me and </v>
<v Speaker 2>cam going on the,</v>

299
00:13:29.890 --> 00:13:33.860
<v Speaker 2>the Arnhem land tripping over territory </v>
<v Speaker 2>back in any food people haven't heard.</v>

300
00:13:35.490 --> 00:13:36.323
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

301
00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:37.413
<v Speaker 2>This is the most ridiculous thing ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you guys had to filter buffalo </v>

302
00:13:40.331 --> 00:13:44.950
<v Speaker 2>piss water because buffalo is still.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tastes like piss the color out of it.</v>

303
00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:47.560
<v Speaker 2>It had the same taste that the science </v>
<v Speaker 2>smell.</v>

304
00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:51.700
<v Speaker 2>And my question is if the water's </v>
<v Speaker 2>filtered,</v>

305
00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:54.430
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't have smelled lever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

306
00:13:54.490 --> 00:13:55.400
<v Speaker 2>it should.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shouldn't it?</v>

307
00:13:55.450 --> 00:13:56.081
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're drinking.</v>

308
00:13:56.081 --> 00:13:57.260
<v Speaker 2>Piss it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>drink a paste,</v>

309
00:13:57.261 --> 00:13:59.130
<v Speaker 2>paste for security for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You guys drank.</v>

310
00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:02.770
<v Speaker 2>But veterans got hell or some energy in </v>
<v Speaker 2>it though because of Buffalo.</v>

311
00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:08.340
<v Speaker 2>Buffalo's Dick if even better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but my energy.</v>

312
00:14:08.780 --> 00:14:11.140
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why you were thinking.</v>

313
00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:13.520
<v Speaker 2>Get pissed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tried to jam the door.</v>

314
00:14:13.530 --> 00:14:16.190
<v Speaker 2>That first at least to told him to drink</v>
<v Speaker 2>the water first.</v>

315
00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:17.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He can test that.</v>

316
00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:18.023
<v Speaker 2>He saved on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Will they have those crazy filtration </v>

317
00:14:19.781 --> 00:14:22.420
<v Speaker 2>systems where you like gravity filters?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that what you used?</v>

318
00:14:22.450 --> 00:14:23.283
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I took one of those in the mountains </v>

319
00:14:24.251 --> 00:14:25.084
<v Speaker 2>on this trip as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never pulled it out and never used it </v>

320
00:14:26.921 --> 00:14:27.754
<v Speaker 2>once because I was always drinking water</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the highest source directly where </v>

321
00:14:30.581 --> 00:14:33.730
<v Speaker 2>it's coming out of the mountain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you do that you're okay.</v>

322
00:14:33.731 --> 00:14:34.750
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to worry about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nah,</v>

323
00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:38.080
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to say yes because they </v>
<v Speaker 2>were go and do it and get sick.</v>

324
00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:39.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sue my ass.</v>

325
00:14:39.251 --> 00:14:40.084
<v Speaker 2>But I've never.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've always had it nine stomach and I </v>

326
00:14:42.941 --> 00:14:43.774
<v Speaker 2>think it's from just doing all that sort</v>
<v Speaker 2>of stuff as a kid you sort of grow with </v>

327
00:14:47.621 --> 00:14:48.454
<v Speaker 2>that and I think your body's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your body creates its own defense </v>

328
00:14:52.011 --> 00:14:53.440
<v Speaker 2>against,</v>
<v Speaker 2>against things like that.</v>

329
00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:57.000
<v Speaker 2>I'm a massive believer in that actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>sign with being dirty.</v>

330
00:14:57.001 --> 00:15:00.350
<v Speaker 2>And I like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like personal hygiene is obviously a big</v>

331
00:15:00.351 --> 00:15:01.560
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

332
00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:03.133
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alita,</v>

333
00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:06.910
<v Speaker 2>I'll lead a chocolate bar with elk blood</v>
<v Speaker 2>all over my hands after skin and,</v>

334
00:15:06.911 --> 00:15:07.744
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or deboning and elk and I think that's </v>

335
00:15:09.591 --> 00:15:11.870
<v Speaker 2>perfectly natural and normal in that </v>
<v Speaker 2>sense.</v>

336
00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:14.510
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never been sick.</v>

337
00:15:14.511 --> 00:15:17.570
<v Speaker 2>I've drunk and some silly looking water </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

338
00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:18.553
<v Speaker 2>But I just think if you're at the top of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the mountain where the water's first </v>

339
00:15:20.751 --> 00:15:23.150
<v Speaker 2>coming out of the hill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>out of the rocks,</v>

340
00:15:23.510 --> 00:15:26.150
<v Speaker 2>then you're safe because there's nothing</v>
<v Speaker 2>along the line.</v>

341
00:15:26.151 --> 00:15:28.430
<v Speaker 2>They're like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an old animal carcass.</v>

342
00:15:28.490 --> 00:15:29.323
<v Speaker 2>Frigging wolf,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit sitting in the water or something </v>

343
00:15:30.771 --> 00:15:34.220
<v Speaker 2>like that to make you sick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's coming right out of the ground.</v>

344
00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:37.340
<v Speaker 2>It's coming right out the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Literally catch it as a streams.</v>

345
00:15:38.030 --> 00:15:38.620
<v Speaker 2>That makes sense.</v>

346
00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:39.440
<v Speaker 2>That's like a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

347
00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:41.720
<v Speaker 2>and that's handy as well because I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>cancer at the top.</v>

348
00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:43.460
<v Speaker 2>So I want to find the highest water </v>
<v Speaker 2>source.</v>

349
00:15:43.461 --> 00:15:45.410
<v Speaker 2>I don't have to drop down so far each </v>
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>

350
00:15:46.010 --> 00:15:49.290
<v Speaker 2>Collect water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's always a good field.</v>

351
00:15:49.291 --> 00:15:51.170
<v Speaker 2>And actually when you come across </v>
<v Speaker 2>freshwater like that.</v>

352
00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:53.670
<v Speaker 2>So how many liters is your pack?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How heavy is your pack?</v>

353
00:15:53.710 --> 00:15:55.880
<v Speaker 2>It's a 2100.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was a small pack.</v>

354
00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:56.361
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

355
00:15:56.361 --> 00:15:58.400
<v Speaker 2>It's not a big.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's very small.</v>

356
00:15:58.890 --> 00:16:00.680
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the badlands.</v>

357
00:16:00.890 --> 00:16:05.840
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Use a 2100 liter pack for a 15 day hunt.</v>

358
00:16:05.870 --> 00:16:07.520
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how light I'm going in.</v>

359
00:16:08.290 --> 00:16:10.700
<v Speaker 2>I have a couple of things that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>strapped to that pack,</v>

360
00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:11.863
<v Speaker 2>which would make it bigger than that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but generally everything fits inside </v>

361
00:16:14.361 --> 00:16:19.361
<v Speaker 2>that package or what's in the pack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jetboil yeah.</v>

362
00:16:19.490 --> 00:16:20.323
<v Speaker 2>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

363
00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:24.350
<v Speaker 2>So I've got similar to MSI reactor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They really good.</v>

364
00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:26.210
<v Speaker 2>You can actually use it in the cold.</v>

365
00:16:26.210 --> 00:16:29.750
<v Speaker 2>It was freezing in my tent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the whole tent froze over that.</v>

366
00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:30.613
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually turned it on in the tent to </v>

367
00:16:31.431 --> 00:16:34.170
<v Speaker 2>warm the tent when I was getting changed</v>
<v Speaker 2>or unchanged at night.</v>

368
00:16:34.171 --> 00:16:34.851
<v Speaker 2>A little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pansy.</v>

369
00:16:34.851 --> 00:16:37.640
<v Speaker 2>But hey it got to put a smile on my </v>
<v Speaker 2>face.</v>

370
00:16:38.210 --> 00:16:40.250
<v Speaker 2>Boils water super quick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

371
00:16:40.251 --> 00:16:41.084
<v Speaker 2>So if the weather is miserable and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>just want to get it done at boils water </v>

372
00:16:43.250 --> 00:16:45.250
<v Speaker 2>super quick for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Run a tanker.</v>

373
00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:46.610
<v Speaker 2>Propane small.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

374
00:16:46.611 --> 00:16:51.380
<v Speaker 2>just a real little backpack one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then because I went in there when it</v>

375
00:16:51.381 --> 00:16:53.670
<v Speaker 2>was stinking hot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it was always cooking,</v>

376
00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:55.460
<v Speaker 2>like it was the hardest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wherever you'd have,</v>

377
00:16:55.461 --> 00:16:57.260
<v Speaker 2>you wouldn't even imagine having a fire </v>
<v Speaker 2>in that,</v>

378
00:16:57.261 --> 00:17:00.140
<v Speaker 2>whether from risk of a wildfire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

379
00:17:00.170 --> 00:17:02.740
<v Speaker 2>starting the bushfire too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

380
00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:04.760
<v Speaker 2>hightailed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it rained and snowed,</v>

381
00:17:04.910 --> 00:17:07.040
<v Speaker 2>everything got wet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was safe at that point.</v>

382
00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:07.873
<v Speaker 2>They have a fire and then a lot of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>cooking that I end up doing was just </v>

383
00:17:10.071 --> 00:17:12.200
<v Speaker 2>over the fire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll save my gas each night,</v>

384
00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:13.463
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I would have ran out of gas </v>

385
00:17:14.571 --> 00:17:15.404
<v Speaker 2>before those 15 days are up if I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>using just that one canister the whole </v>

386
00:17:18.141 --> 00:17:20.480
<v Speaker 2>time and that you'd end up having to </v>
<v Speaker 2>pack out,</v>

387
00:17:21.110 --> 00:17:25.430
<v Speaker 2>go into town by the gas and then pack </v>
<v Speaker 2>all the way back and you'd end up losing</v>

388
00:17:25.431 --> 00:17:26.264
<v Speaker 2>two days because it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a full day walking out with no </v>

389
00:17:29.361 --> 00:17:30.200
<v Speaker 2>weight at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

390
00:17:30.201 --> 00:17:31.790
<v Speaker 2>just speed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>walking down the mountain,</v>

391
00:17:31.850 --> 00:17:33.320
<v Speaker 2>trying to get it out of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a full day.</v>

392
00:17:33.321 --> 00:17:34.570
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

393
00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:36.500
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got my reactor,</v>

394
00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:38.720
<v Speaker 2>I've got my water filter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like I said,</v>

395
00:17:38.721 --> 00:17:41.590
<v Speaker 2>I never used it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got a small one person 10,</v>

396
00:17:42.110 --> 00:17:42.943
<v Speaker 2>a mattress at really good sleeping bag.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's actually overrated for the </v>

397
00:17:46.221 --> 00:17:47.054
<v Speaker 2>conditions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I always think you're better off </v>

398
00:17:47.841 --> 00:17:48.650
<v Speaker 2>going overrated.</v>

399
00:17:48.650 --> 00:17:52.320
<v Speaker 2>You get some bad weather log I had and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got an underride sleeping bag and</v>

400
00:17:52.321 --> 00:17:54.180
<v Speaker 2>you're not getting sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to Ms.</v>

401
00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:55.170
<v Speaker 2>Hunt now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's for sure.</v>

402
00:17:55.770 --> 00:17:58.950
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I've just got a couple of knives.</v>

403
00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:02.610
<v Speaker 2>I've got a full safety kit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bandages.</v>

404
00:18:02.770 --> 00:18:04.950
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've actually been carrying.</v>

405
00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:06.023
<v Speaker 2>I didn't use them on this trip.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even a little like a water filtration </v>

406
00:18:09.601 --> 00:18:11.250
<v Speaker 2>pill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is always handy.</v>

407
00:18:11.251 --> 00:18:12.084
<v Speaker 2>So you didn't have to carry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you feel to kid everyday if you come </v>

408
00:18:13.741 --> 00:18:15.510
<v Speaker 2>across some decent water that was down </v>
<v Speaker 2>low,</v>

409
00:18:15.511 --> 00:18:17.830
<v Speaker 2>you could just put the pill in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

410
00:18:18.270 --> 00:18:19.103
<v Speaker 2>we're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people go wrong with these </v>

411
00:18:20.190 --> 00:18:23.460
<v Speaker 2>filtrate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The water filtration and the pills is,</v>

412
00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:24.693
<v Speaker 2>you still require both of you come </v>
<v Speaker 2>across dirty water because the pills </v>

413
00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:31.620
<v Speaker 2>only going to kill bacteria within </v>
<v Speaker 2>reasonably clear water.</v>

414
00:18:31.621 --> 00:18:35.160
<v Speaker 2>It's not going to kill the solids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you're scooping up dirty water,</v>

415
00:18:35.250 --> 00:18:36.083
<v Speaker 2>put an appeal in and then drinking </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything that's within the solids of </v>

416
00:18:38.881 --> 00:18:40.800
<v Speaker 2>that water,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're still going to get sick from.</v>

417
00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:42.053
<v Speaker 2>So in a sense you're still,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you still need the two of them if you </v>

418
00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:49.500
<v Speaker 2>want a hunt like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the water filtrations or some,</v>

419
00:18:49.501 --> 00:18:51.320
<v Speaker 2>because it's 99 point nine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nine,</v>

420
00:18:51.321 --> 00:18:54.120
<v Speaker 2>nine percent of all bacteria.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to filter out of your water.</v>

421
00:18:54.450 --> 00:18:56.670
<v Speaker 2>And the pills are world markets or </v>
<v Speaker 2>chlorine or something?</v>

422
00:18:56.671 --> 00:18:58.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they like a chlorine pill here.</v>

423
00:18:58.171 --> 00:18:59.760
<v Speaker 2>There's a few different ones yet on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>market.</v>

424
00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:03.930
<v Speaker 2>So you take those essentials.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You essentially were in the same clothes</v>

425
00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:05.550
<v Speaker 2>everyday.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Same clothes every day.</v>

426
00:19:06.510 --> 00:19:07.343
<v Speaker 2>I take few changes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the socks and underwear and I'm saying </v>

427
00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:12.390
<v Speaker 2>clothes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>clothes every day.</v>

428
00:19:12.391 --> 00:19:13.224
<v Speaker 2>And then if I did get a hot hot day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this was the plan that never ever </v>

429
00:19:15.961 --> 00:19:16.794
<v Speaker 2>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if I did get a hot day and I came </v>

430
00:19:18.361 --> 00:19:19.194
<v Speaker 2>past a stream,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was actually going to wash some </v>

431
00:19:20.821 --> 00:19:21.654
<v Speaker 2>clothes in like a dry bag,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just a bit of water and the clothes and </v>

432
00:19:24.331 --> 00:19:25.164
<v Speaker 2>then hang them up and I just never got </v>
<v Speaker 2>that break in the weather and I wanted </v>

433
00:19:28.681 --> 00:19:29.514
<v Speaker 2>to hunt every day and every minute of </v>
<v Speaker 2>light so I'd just get up in the morning </v>

434
00:19:31.861 --> 00:19:34.620
<v Speaker 2>and put wet clothes on if I didn't draw </v>
<v Speaker 2>them on the fire that night.</v>

435
00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:38.880
<v Speaker 2>So it sounds like most of the weight in </v>
<v Speaker 2>your pack is food generally?</v>

436
00:19:38.940 --> 00:19:40.470
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just 10 days of food.</v>

437
00:19:40.471 --> 00:19:43.380
<v Speaker 2>And how many pounds of food you'd taken </v>
<v Speaker 2>the day around?</v>

438
00:19:43.381 --> 00:19:44.820
<v Speaker 2>Two?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

439
00:19:45.030 --> 00:19:46.780
<v Speaker 2>maybe a bit less.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

440
00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:47.913
<v Speaker 2>it might've been a bit less.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I smashed the chocolate bars when I'm </v>

441
00:19:50.250 --> 00:19:51.970
<v Speaker 2>out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dude.</v>

442
00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:53.860
<v Speaker 2>Why talk about smashed chocolate and </v>
<v Speaker 2>nine.</v>

443
00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:56.130
<v Speaker 2>But when I'm in the mountains I really </v>
<v Speaker 2>smashed chocolate.</v>

444
00:19:56.780 --> 00:19:59.910
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just liked that bit of a fix and a bit</v>

445
00:19:59.911 --> 00:20:01.370
<v Speaker 2>of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a bit of a pick up,</v>

446
00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:03.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and keep you going.</v>

447
00:20:03.001 --> 00:20:05.250
<v Speaker 2>And it's no different than a fire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

448
00:20:05.251 --> 00:20:08.040
<v Speaker 2>like if you get a fire going at night,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's at like bit of a boost,</v>

449
00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:08.903
<v Speaker 2>like a spirit spirit boost.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's the same as a chocolate bar </v>

450
00:20:11.971 --> 00:20:14.730
<v Speaker 2>just to sit down and go away on a </v>
<v Speaker 2>chocolate bar.</v>

451
00:20:14.731 --> 00:20:15.564
<v Speaker 2>Just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

452
00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:17.250
<v Speaker 2>life's is good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>keep going.</v>

453
00:20:17.370 --> 00:20:18.920
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like,</v>

454
00:20:18.921 --> 00:20:20.640
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but as far as like energy,</v>

455
00:20:20.641 --> 00:20:23.540
<v Speaker 2>don't you crash when you have one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>those things go up high,</v>

456
00:20:23.850 --> 00:20:26.130
<v Speaker 2>get a sugar crash.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't really crash.</v>

457
00:20:26.190 --> 00:20:26.791
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's funny,</v>

458
00:20:26.791 --> 00:20:29.310
<v Speaker 2>I hear it with a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

459
00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:30.870
<v Speaker 2>I never crashed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brendan Burns.</v>

460
00:20:30.871 --> 00:20:33.270
<v Speaker 2>We're seeing the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He brings like snickers bars,</v>

461
00:20:33.810 --> 00:20:35.430
<v Speaker 2>snickers bars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really good.</v>

462
00:20:35.490 --> 00:20:37.980
<v Speaker 2>Milky ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They like a Mozbar back in Australia,</v>

463
00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:41.670
<v Speaker 2>like milky ways here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anything sugary?</v>

464
00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:44.333
<v Speaker 2>Well also I would imagine the amount of </v>
<v Speaker 2>calories you're burning when you're </v>

465
00:20:46.681 --> 00:20:50.170
<v Speaker 2>walking mountains like that with a pack </v>
<v Speaker 2>on heavy pack.</v>

466
00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:52.210
<v Speaker 2>It's huge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had um,</v>

467
00:20:52.690 --> 00:20:55.960
<v Speaker 2>but I had the desire to actually go and </v>
<v Speaker 2>do this trip and do a bit of weight loss</v>

468
00:20:55.961 --> 00:20:56.794
<v Speaker 2>at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think if I wasn't going to do weight </v>

469
00:20:59.051 --> 00:21:02.110
<v Speaker 2>loss at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I'll probably pack some more food,</v>

470
00:21:02.550 --> 00:21:03.383
<v Speaker 2>some more goodies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you did it on purpose to lose some </v>

471
00:21:05.621 --> 00:21:08.200
<v Speaker 2>weight and I did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I lost weight.</v>

472
00:21:09.370 --> 00:21:11.350
<v Speaker 2>I lost a lot of white doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

473
00:21:11.351 --> 00:21:13.240
<v Speaker 2>def definitely done on purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There'd be some,</v>

474
00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:17.620
<v Speaker 2>some days where I'd just have a snack in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the morning for breakfast,</v>

475
00:21:17.630 --> 00:21:18.463
<v Speaker 2>like an energy bar and actual energy bar</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the morning and I'd go all the way </v>

476
00:21:21.701 --> 00:21:22.534
<v Speaker 2>through and I wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't hide back in the camp til </v>

477
00:21:23.951 --> 00:21:24.784
<v Speaker 2>1130 at night because I was trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>stay out where I thought the balls were </v>

478
00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:31.030
<v Speaker 2>and I'd have a quick dinner in camp that</v>
<v Speaker 2>night and that was it.</v>

479
00:21:31.031 --> 00:21:32.950
<v Speaker 2>And I wouldn't even feel hungry </v>
<v Speaker 2>throughout the day.</v>

480
00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:34.470
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

481
00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:39.190
<v Speaker 2>I think just from being so active and </v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously good water intake whenever you</v>

482
00:21:39.191 --> 00:21:41.110
<v Speaker 2>can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

483
00:21:41.230 --> 00:21:42.460
<v Speaker 2>there was never a point where I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

484
00:21:42.710 --> 00:21:44.110
<v Speaker 2>ahead,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm starving the day,</v>

485
00:21:44.111 --> 00:21:46.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going any further until eight or</v>

486
00:21:46.241 --> 00:21:47.320
<v Speaker 2>anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just,</v>

487
00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:48.161
<v Speaker 2>it was all go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>

488
00:21:48.161 --> 00:21:48.430
<v Speaker 2>go.</v>

489
00:21:48.430 --> 00:21:52.270
<v Speaker 2>And Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now when you take a plan like this,</v>

490
00:21:52.271 --> 00:21:55.900
<v Speaker 2>when you decided to go on a deep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>deep mountain on like this,</v>

491
00:21:56.650 --> 00:21:57.483
<v Speaker 2>what do you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

492
00:21:57.550 --> 00:21:59.990
<v Speaker 2>how do you pick where you're going?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you a,</v>

493
00:21:59.991 --> 00:22:04.310
<v Speaker 2>you studying google earth and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting tips from people studying Google</v>

494
00:22:04.310 --> 00:22:05.220
<v Speaker 2>Earth's the big one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

495
00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:08.050
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would suggest for anyone that wants to</v>

496
00:22:08.051 --> 00:22:10.090
<v Speaker 2>do a backpack hunt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

497
00:22:10.091 --> 00:22:14.710
<v Speaker 2>like a do it yourself hunt is study </v>
<v Speaker 2>google earth and I'll do a radius.</v>

498
00:22:14.711 --> 00:22:18.220
<v Speaker 2>I would look for a radius with the least</v>
<v Speaker 2>amount of roads,</v>

499
00:22:18.221 --> 00:22:21.730
<v Speaker 2>any sort of infrastructure around it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the most wilderness looking area,</v>

500
00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:23.433
<v Speaker 2>even away from trial heads.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hate been near a trial head or where </v>

501
00:22:25.661 --> 00:22:29.260
<v Speaker 2>there's a trial that people are going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be walking in on or anything like that.</v>

502
00:22:29.261 --> 00:22:30.094
<v Speaker 2>Like I mean real back country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got a Bush bash it to get in </v>

503
00:22:31.961 --> 00:22:34.720
<v Speaker 2>there just fine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

504
00:22:34.750 --> 00:22:35.583
<v Speaker 2>do your research,</v>
<v Speaker 2>find that area with the least amount of </v>

505
00:22:38.081 --> 00:22:41.560
<v Speaker 2>activity and then put a.in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the middle or roughly in the middle.</v>

506
00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:42.393
<v Speaker 2>And that's where you should set up camp </v>
<v Speaker 2>and like getting that live with the </v>

507
00:22:44.441 --> 00:22:46.120
<v Speaker 2>balls or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>animals you're hunting,</v>

508
00:22:46.121 --> 00:22:48.560
<v Speaker 2>get in there and live with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

509
00:22:49.330 --> 00:22:52.530
<v Speaker 2>I think not being afraid to fail on a </v>
<v Speaker 2>hunt,</v>

510
00:22:52.630 --> 00:22:53.463
<v Speaker 2>the big one because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people or they might not even </v>

511
00:22:55.241 --> 00:22:56.590
<v Speaker 2>be any bulls there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

512
00:22:56.620 --> 00:22:57.453
<v Speaker 2>who cares.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be an awesome experience </v>

513
00:22:58.451 --> 00:22:59.284
<v Speaker 2>anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's a place that you can tick off </v>

514
00:23:00.461 --> 00:23:02.050
<v Speaker 2>the list.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going back there.</v>

515
00:23:02.051 --> 00:23:03.700
<v Speaker 2>There was nothing there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then next year,</v>

516
00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:05.290
<v Speaker 2>try the next bottle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The next week,</v>

517
00:23:05.291 --> 00:23:07.780
<v Speaker 2>try another spot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

518
00:23:08.230 --> 00:23:12.940
<v Speaker 2>I had hunted around that area previously</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so I knew there was elk in the area.</v>

519
00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:14.213
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just had never been that far back in </v>

520
00:23:16.271 --> 00:23:18.070
<v Speaker 2>before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I tell you,</v>

521
00:23:18.071 --> 00:23:18.904
<v Speaker 2>to tell you the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is nearly completely filed on me </v>

522
00:23:20.561 --> 00:23:23.830
<v Speaker 2>because I went days and days without </v>
<v Speaker 2>hearing or seeing or an elk.</v>

523
00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:26.330
<v Speaker 2>But the sign was there to say that we're</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

524
00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:27.273
<v Speaker 2>in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just that the grizzlies and the </v>

525
00:23:28.630 --> 00:23:29.463
<v Speaker 2>wolves were hunting that area so hard </v>
<v Speaker 2>that it shut the fuck up and pushed a </v>

526
00:23:32.561 --> 00:23:35.270
<v Speaker 2>lot of them out of the area.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

527
00:23:35.410 --> 00:23:37.450
<v Speaker 2>And then I was nearly new food source.</v>

528
00:23:39.690 --> 00:23:41.290
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

529
00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:45.040
<v Speaker 2>So when you get in there and you don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>see anything for a couple of days,</v>

530
00:23:45.050 --> 00:23:45.761
<v Speaker 2>like what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

531
00:23:45.761 --> 00:23:46.070
<v Speaker 2>what is</v>

532
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:47.330
<v Speaker 3>the mindset like?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you mean?</v>

533
00:23:47.370 --> 00:23:52.370
<v Speaker 2>He hates a day out and there's always </v>
<v Speaker 2>that like you second guess yourself.</v>

534
00:23:52.421 --> 00:23:54.430
<v Speaker 2>This was a stupid move you shouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>have came in here.</v>

535
00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:56.650
<v Speaker 2>You need to change spots,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then it's like,</v>

536
00:23:56.980 --> 00:23:59.470
<v Speaker 2>but at the same time your experience in </v>
<v Speaker 2>this for a reason,</v>

537
00:23:59.471 --> 00:24:01.720
<v Speaker 2>and this is how hunting should be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hunting should be hard.</v>

538
00:24:01.990 --> 00:24:02.823
<v Speaker 2>You should hunting never be unless </v>
<v Speaker 2>you've done your research going into a </v>

539
00:24:06.221 --> 00:24:08.860
<v Speaker 2>place and there's just like game walking</v>
<v Speaker 2>past year everywhere.</v>

540
00:24:08.861 --> 00:24:10.390
<v Speaker 2>There should always be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because that's the hunt,</v>

541
00:24:10.391 --> 00:24:12.910
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Finding it or going through the hardship</v>

542
00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:14.950
<v Speaker 2>to find it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tracking it,</v>

543
00:24:14.951 --> 00:24:18.250
<v Speaker 2>find and find them where's the better </v>
<v Speaker 2>spot within that area.</v>

544
00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:20.820
<v Speaker 2>So at the same time that when winds </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

545
00:24:21.220 --> 00:24:22.990
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've made a bad decision,</v>

546
00:24:23.170 --> 00:24:24.490
<v Speaker 2>this is a crap spot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the be,</v>

547
00:24:25.090 --> 00:24:27.110
<v Speaker 2>there's the whole experience of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

548
00:24:27.190 --> 00:24:29.800
<v Speaker 2>this is how hunting should be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It should be difficult.</v>

549
00:24:29.801 --> 00:24:32.530
<v Speaker 2>You should have to work your ass off to </v>
<v Speaker 2>try and find the animal.</v>

550
00:24:32.950 --> 00:24:34.840
<v Speaker 2>And when you actually do find that </v>
<v Speaker 2>animal,</v>

551
00:24:34.841 --> 00:24:38.720
<v Speaker 2>how much better is it because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just like if,</v>

552
00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:43.660
<v Speaker 2>if you hunted for 11 months and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't say a bull,</v>

553
00:24:43.860 --> 00:24:45.790
<v Speaker 2>you found a boy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you had a shot in your midst,</v>

554
00:24:45.850 --> 00:24:48.460
<v Speaker 2>but then the next one you get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how good's that next one that you get,</v>

555
00:24:48.910 --> 00:24:49.743
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if that was the case and it was very </v>

556
00:24:50.741 --> 00:24:53.110
<v Speaker 2>similar on this trip where I put in all </v>
<v Speaker 2>that effort,</v>

557
00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:56.260
<v Speaker 2>didn't see an animal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One opportunity,</v>

558
00:24:56.350 --> 00:24:59.770
<v Speaker 2>a ball comes in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I ended up calling that bull from like a</v>

559
00:24:59.770 --> 00:25:00.603
<v Speaker 2>mile away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could just hear him coming up this </v>

560
00:25:01.151 --> 00:25:04.810
<v Speaker 2>canyon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I did that shot and dude,</v>

561
00:25:04.811 --> 00:25:08.260
<v Speaker 2>I teared up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was crying because I knew how much had</v>

562
00:25:08.261 --> 00:25:09.520
<v Speaker 2>gone into it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

563
00:25:09.521 --> 00:25:11.470
<v Speaker 2>And it's not just the effort,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

564
00:25:11.471 --> 00:25:14.450
<v Speaker 2>like obviously I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm away from my wife Kim and the kids.</v>

565
00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:15.333
<v Speaker 2>I'm away from the kids for a month now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's all that sacrifice is all the </v>

566
00:25:19.031 --> 00:25:20.470
<v Speaker 2>hard shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's all the effort.</v>

567
00:25:20.830 --> 00:25:21.663
<v Speaker 2>There's walking in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's putting up with that absolutely </v>

568
00:25:23.321 --> 00:25:24.154
<v Speaker 2>atrocious wherever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then finally one opportunity comes </v>

569
00:25:26.951 --> 00:25:29.530
<v Speaker 2>up and you kill that animal as well as </v>
<v Speaker 2>kill an animal.</v>

570
00:25:29.540 --> 00:25:31.810
<v Speaker 2>That's a hard thing to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

571
00:25:31.811 --> 00:25:32.644
<v Speaker 2>I balled up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was crying like I think I cried a </v>

572
00:25:34.630 --> 00:25:36.700
<v Speaker 2>dozen times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every time I thought about it when I was</v>

573
00:25:36.701 --> 00:25:39.790
<v Speaker 2>standing over the ball I was crying and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

574
00:25:39.820 --> 00:25:43.120
<v Speaker 2>that's why it's got to be that hard so </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can appreciate their animal.</v>

575
00:25:43.150 --> 00:25:46.690
<v Speaker 2>So you realize what has to go into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hunt to actually get something killed.</v>

576
00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:48.910
<v Speaker 2>Should I think everyone should be like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

577
00:25:49.090 --> 00:25:49.790
<v Speaker 2>I hope they're not.</v>

578
00:25:49.790 --> 00:25:52.550
<v Speaker 3>Well there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of elk in Montana,</v>

579
00:25:52.580 --> 00:25:55.120
<v Speaker 3>but Montana is so huge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

580
00:25:55.700 --> 00:25:57.290
<v Speaker 3>Massive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>massive place.</v>

581
00:25:57.291 --> 00:25:59.780
<v Speaker 3>And the amount of wilderness that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>were encountering,</v>

582
00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:01.190
<v Speaker 3>if you have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

583
00:26:01.191 --> 00:26:02.024
<v Speaker 3>herds of elk all over the place,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's super likely that you could like </v>

584
00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:08.990
<v Speaker 3>wind up in a spot with nothing around </v>
<v Speaker 3>you for miles and miles around.</v>

585
00:26:09.260 --> 00:26:10.220
<v Speaker 3>Yep,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

586
00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:11.920
<v Speaker 3>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the.</v>

587
00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:12.973
<v Speaker 3>I think the heartbeat with that country </v>
<v Speaker 3>that I've been going into is the wolf </v>

588
00:26:16.581 --> 00:26:17.414
<v Speaker 3>populations getting so big.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know you love wolves is pitches of </v>

589
00:26:19.811 --> 00:26:21.310
<v Speaker 3>frigging wolves in this joint </v>
<v Speaker 3>everywhere.</v>

590
00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:22.173
<v Speaker 3>But I do love them all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to share to know where they're </v>

591
00:26:27.290 --> 00:26:29.360
<v Speaker 3>scary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Definitely scary.</v>

592
00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:33.530
<v Speaker 3>What's weird is what we were talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about before the podcast started.</v>

593
00:26:33.531 --> 00:26:36.380
<v Speaker 3>You were talking about Australia and </v>
<v Speaker 3>what you call the greenies,</v>

594
00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:37.573
<v Speaker 3>which are the green people that want to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't want animals to die and they </v>

595
00:26:40.881 --> 00:26:43.680
<v Speaker 3>want this population to explode,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's not a balance.</v>

596
00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:44.873
<v Speaker 3>And that was the idea behind </v>
<v Speaker 3>reintroducing wolves was to create a </v>

597
00:26:49.201 --> 00:26:50.034
<v Speaker 3>balance because there was a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>animals that were living in the </v>

598
00:26:53.431 --> 00:26:57.990
<v Speaker 3>yellowstone greater yellowstone area.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so they introduced these wolves.</v>

599
00:26:58.500 --> 00:26:59.333
<v Speaker 3>But the problem was they had an </v>
<v Speaker 3>agreement when they introduced these </v>

600
00:27:02.311 --> 00:27:05.010
<v Speaker 3>wolves that when they reached a </v>
<v Speaker 3>sustainable population,</v>

601
00:27:05.011 --> 00:27:07.920
<v Speaker 3>they reached a certain numbers of </v>
<v Speaker 3>several thousand wolves,</v>

602
00:27:08.130 --> 00:27:08.963
<v Speaker 3>then they would open up a hunting season</v>
<v Speaker 3>on them to try to control the </v>

603
00:27:10.801 --> 00:27:14.130
<v Speaker 3>population,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but as soon as they reached that number,</v>

604
00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:19.460
<v Speaker 3>the people that were involved in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>relocation of the rules and the wildlife</v>

605
00:27:20.251 --> 00:27:21.084
<v Speaker 3>protection people and all the people </v>
<v Speaker 3>that are like really animal rights </v>

606
00:27:23.941 --> 00:27:24.774
<v Speaker 3>advocates,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

607
00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:26.790
<v Speaker 3>they backed out of it and they said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

608
00:27:26.850 --> 00:27:29.490
<v Speaker 3>we don't want any hunting on any of </v>
<v Speaker 3>these worlds ever.</v>

609
00:27:29.940 --> 00:27:33.360
<v Speaker 3>And so there's this big battle and a lot</v>
<v Speaker 3>of states have opened up hunting seasons</v>

610
00:27:33.361 --> 00:27:34.770
<v Speaker 3>on wolves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Montana included.</v>

611
00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:36.900
<v Speaker 3>But it's still,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a battle,</v>

612
00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:39.570
<v Speaker 3>there's a battle to try to control the </v>
<v Speaker 3>wolf populations.</v>

613
00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:40.980
<v Speaker 3>It's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I went.</v>

614
00:27:41.010 --> 00:27:44.040
<v Speaker 3>So I went into yellowstone last year </v>
<v Speaker 3>after my hunt just,</v>

615
00:27:44.130 --> 00:27:47.730
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thought I had all my photography gay and</v>

616
00:27:47.731 --> 00:27:50.190
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't say a single elk,</v>

617
00:27:50.990 --> 00:27:52.470
<v Speaker 3>but you got to go near where the people </v>
<v Speaker 3>are.</v>

618
00:27:52.710 --> 00:27:54.420
<v Speaker 3>I saw a ton of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that crazy?</v>

619
00:27:54.421 --> 00:27:58.700
<v Speaker 3>I was there with my kids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We got selfies with fucking elk.</v>

620
00:28:00.060 --> 00:28:02.000
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like the whole time I was like,</v>

621
00:28:02.070 --> 00:28:04.050
<v Speaker 3>fucking wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've wrecked this joint.</v>

622
00:28:04.410 --> 00:28:06.240
<v Speaker 3>Didn't say anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

623
00:28:06.241 --> 00:28:07.074
<v Speaker 3>the elk have decided that people are </v>
<v Speaker 3>super safe because no one has hunted in </v>

624
00:28:10.321 --> 00:28:12.690
<v Speaker 3>yellowstone for 100 and whatever the </v>
<v Speaker 3>hell years.</v>

625
00:28:12.990 --> 00:28:13.823
<v Speaker 3>So when you go to the visitor area,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you first pull into yellowstone </v>

626
00:28:16.441 --> 00:28:17.670
<v Speaker 3>lake,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yellowstone has like this,</v>

627
00:28:17.671 --> 00:28:19.500
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is on the Montana side.</v>

628
00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:20.633
<v Speaker 3>Yellowstone has this area where there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>like a gas station and there's like a </v>

629
00:28:23.491 --> 00:28:25.710
<v Speaker 3>store and it's fucking elk everywhere.</v>

630
00:28:25.710 --> 00:28:28.560
<v Speaker 3>Like I'll show you my friend.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got selfies,</v>

631
00:28:28.561 --> 00:28:30.840
<v Speaker 3>I got elk selfies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But they're,</v>

632
00:28:30.841 --> 00:28:31.770
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

633
00:28:31.830 --> 00:28:35.650
<v Speaker 3>they're not even remotely nervous about </v>
<v Speaker 3>people that aren't k.</v>

634
00:28:35.660 --> 00:28:37.060
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't,</v>

635
00:28:37.110 --> 00:28:39.050
<v Speaker 3>you aren't doing days.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

636
00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:42.700
<v Speaker 3>access data and having Texas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Cheeto d,</v>

637
00:28:44.220 --> 00:28:47.790
<v Speaker 3>your stupid head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how I saying,</v>

638
00:28:48.010 --> 00:28:51.720
<v Speaker 3>but in the background that just living </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the hotels,</v>

639
00:28:51.721 --> 00:28:52.554
<v Speaker 3>but it looks hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're just chilling back there and </v>

640
00:28:54.701 --> 00:28:57.750
<v Speaker 3>there was a gang of a man that's all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were all over the place.</v>

641
00:28:58.280 --> 00:28:59.113
<v Speaker 3>There were a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

642
00:28:59.170 --> 00:29:02.850
<v Speaker 3>it's really weird because it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right when you pull into the area,</v>

643
00:29:03.710 --> 00:29:07.010
<v Speaker 3>all you see is like just loads of </v>
<v Speaker 3>arrowhead.</v>

644
00:29:07.470 --> 00:29:08.740
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that,</v>

645
00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:11.760
<v Speaker 3>that the data that we have nightgown </v>
<v Speaker 3>live near the station.</v>

646
00:29:11.761 --> 00:29:12.594
<v Speaker 3>So the station in Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously it's just like a ranch and I </v>

647
00:29:14.950 --> 00:29:18.560
<v Speaker 3>like a big farm because of the dingoes </v>
<v Speaker 3>just smashed,</v>

648
00:29:18.561 --> 00:29:21.720
<v Speaker 3>it smashed the population so that those </v>
<v Speaker 3>title did.</v>

649
00:29:21.780 --> 00:29:22.613
<v Speaker 3>I got back on near the homesteads </v>
<v Speaker 3>because the dean goes less likely to </v>

650
00:29:25.771 --> 00:29:28.380
<v Speaker 3>come around the home.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really crazy and then you move.</v>

651
00:29:28.620 --> 00:29:31.320
<v Speaker 3>If you're hunting you'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>screw this,</v>

652
00:29:31.321 --> 00:29:34.020
<v Speaker 3>I'm gone back into the back country now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's going to be hateful or deer back</v>

653
00:29:34.021 --> 00:29:37.680
<v Speaker 3>there compared to ran in the house and </v>
<v Speaker 3>there'll be no deer out there at all.</v>

654
00:29:37.820 --> 00:29:38.850
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They would be very limited,</v>

655
00:29:38.851 --> 00:29:39.684
<v Speaker 3>Debbie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There'll be the stags that are moving </v>

656
00:29:40.621 --> 00:29:42.100
<v Speaker 3>through the area and that's about</v>

657
00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:42.933
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The nucleus of the cheadle deer live </v>

658
00:29:44.531 --> 00:29:47.140
<v Speaker 2>around the homestead where it's safe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not dumb.</v>

659
00:29:47.890 --> 00:29:48.723
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting.</v>

660
00:29:48.820 --> 00:29:53.230
<v Speaker 1>Same thing with deer in around here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll find them in suburban areas.</v>

661
00:29:53.290 --> 00:29:54.123
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he also find coyotes and suburban </v>

662
00:29:55.661 --> 00:29:57.760
<v Speaker 1>areas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but less mountain lions,</v>

663
00:29:57.761 --> 00:30:01.300
<v Speaker 1>mountain lions try to avoid human </v>
<v Speaker 1>populations more and that's what usually</v>

664
00:30:01.301 --> 00:30:01.640
<v Speaker 1>gets</v>

665
00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:04.310
<v Speaker 2>deer out here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All the news back home has been mountain</v>

666
00:30:04.311 --> 00:30:06.920
<v Speaker 2>lions in behind your house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably.</v>

667
00:30:07.090 --> 00:30:08.160
<v Speaker 2>There's quite a few.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

668
00:30:08.230 --> 00:30:09.063
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cool</v>

669
00:30:09.150 --> 00:30:09.983
<v Speaker 1>pictures of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's Bobcat's I've seen bobcats out </v>

670
00:30:11.911 --> 00:30:13.150
<v Speaker 1>near me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's,</v>

671
00:30:13.190 --> 00:30:15.300
<v Speaker 1>there's a mountain lions in California </v>
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

672
00:30:15.301 --> 00:30:16.134
<v Speaker 1>There's quite a few of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>California is an interesting place </v>

673
00:30:18.750 --> 00:30:19.640
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

674
00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:21.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>California,</v>

675
00:30:21.031 --> 00:30:23.370
<v Speaker 1>they don't want to control the </v>
<v Speaker 1>predators.</v>

676
00:30:23.490 --> 00:30:27.030
<v Speaker 1>They want the predators to control the </v>
<v Speaker 1>game population.</v>

677
00:30:27.031 --> 00:30:28.410
<v Speaker 1>And because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's not that many</v>

678
00:30:28.470 --> 00:30:29.490
<v Speaker 2>deer here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

679
00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:31.730
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I understand that it's not.</v>

680
00:30:32.070 --> 00:30:34.450
<v Speaker 2>And I can say the method behind it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know it.</v>

681
00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:35.593
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my issue is that humans in a sense of </v>

682
00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:38.680
<v Speaker 2>the ultimate Predator,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

683
00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:42.930
<v Speaker 2>and that everything should be not </v>
<v Speaker 2>controlled.</v>

684
00:30:42.931 --> 00:30:44.790
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

685
00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:49.180
<v Speaker 2>what's the good way of saying this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that that Bain,</v>

686
00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:51.420
<v Speaker 2>the Apex Predator that we are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are,</v>

687
00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:52.633
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we obviously got a part in that whole </v>

688
00:30:55.201 --> 00:30:57.810
<v Speaker 2>food chain as well when it comes to </v>
<v Speaker 2>things like that.</v>

689
00:30:57.840 --> 00:31:01.620
<v Speaker 2>Some people don't agree with that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they understand that and I can say,</v>

690
00:31:01.621 --> 00:31:02.454
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll talk before about the wolves been </v>

691
00:31:03.661 --> 00:31:06.960
<v Speaker 2>introduced to control the population and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the numbers,</v>

692
00:31:07.410 --> 00:31:11.430
<v Speaker 2>but there's obviously got to be a point </v>
<v Speaker 2>where the wolves are controlled as well.</v>

693
00:31:11.431 --> 00:31:12.690
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So who does that?</v>

694
00:31:12.930 --> 00:31:13.840
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was all well</v>

695
00:31:13.850 --> 00:31:14.683
<v Speaker 1>done early,</v>
<v Speaker 1>early on in North America because of </v>

696
00:31:17.731 --> 00:31:18.564
<v Speaker 1>cattle ranchers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what they would do is they would </v>

697
00:31:19.801 --> 00:31:20.634
<v Speaker 1>shoot wild horses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had a huge wild horse problem and </v>

698
00:31:23.071 --> 00:31:26.310
<v Speaker 1>the wild horse problem is actually a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's reemerging.</v>

699
00:31:26.311 --> 00:31:29.730
<v Speaker 1>There's quite a few wild horses in North</v>
<v Speaker 1>America and they're trying to figure out</v>

700
00:31:29.731 --> 00:31:32.010
<v Speaker 1>what to do with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's really controversial.</v>

701
00:31:32.011 --> 00:31:33.360
<v Speaker 1>It's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of interesting.</v>

702
00:31:33.710 --> 00:31:34.543
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what they would do back then was </v>

703
00:31:36.001 --> 00:31:38.790
<v Speaker 1>they would shoot these wild horses and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then they would shoot a wolf.</v>

704
00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:39.653
<v Speaker 1>They would shoot like one of the Alphas </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they would take the wolf and rub it </v>

705
00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:45.480
<v Speaker 1>and take it sank glands and rub it all </v>
<v Speaker 1>over the,</v>

706
00:31:45.481 --> 00:31:48.150
<v Speaker 1>a dead horse and then fill the horse up </v>
<v Speaker 1>with strychnine.</v>

707
00:31:48.660 --> 00:31:51.120
<v Speaker 1>So the other wolves would come around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would smell.</v>

708
00:31:51.150 --> 00:31:54.060
<v Speaker 1>They're missing Alpha friend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

709
00:31:54.390 --> 00:31:56.670
<v Speaker 1>they would eat the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eat this horse carcass,</v>

710
00:31:56.671 --> 00:31:58.170
<v Speaker 1>and then we'd get district on and die.</v>

711
00:31:58.200 --> 00:31:59.033
<v Speaker 1>So doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they extra painted walls from the </v>

712
00:32:00.811 --> 00:32:04.710
<v Speaker 1>majority of the American West.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how they killed them all.</v>

713
00:32:04.770 --> 00:32:05.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really.</v>

714
00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:08.940
<v Speaker 1>But then they realized that they did a </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible thing by doing that.</v>

715
00:32:08.941 --> 00:32:12.960
<v Speaker 1>And so they started reintroducing them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a balance somewhere.</v>

716
00:32:13.020 --> 00:32:14.250
<v Speaker 1>Obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love wolves.</v>

717
00:32:14.251 --> 00:32:16.630
<v Speaker 1>I think they're cool as hell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's,</v>

718
00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:17.880
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is a balance.</v>

719
00:32:17.881 --> 00:32:20.690
<v Speaker 1>But the balance is real tricky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's because like there's a,</v>

720
00:32:20.730 --> 00:32:23.340
<v Speaker 1>a very small number of them in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Washington state,</v>

721
00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:27.810
<v Speaker 1>but the small number of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the small number of wolf packs,</v>

722
00:32:27.930 --> 00:32:32.100
<v Speaker 1>I've started attacking cattle ranches </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're killing these cattle.</v>

723
00:32:32.370 --> 00:32:35.160
<v Speaker 1>And so these ranchers want these wolves </v>
<v Speaker 1>killed.</v>

724
00:32:35.190 --> 00:32:36.023
<v Speaker 1>And so they've decided to kill some of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the wolves and it's a huge controversy </v>

725
00:32:38.821 --> 00:32:39.950
<v Speaker 1>in Washington state because they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

726
00:32:39.951 --> 00:32:40.160
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

727
00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:40.993
<v Speaker 3>there's not that many fucking balls and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you guys are going to kill these walls </v>

728
00:32:42.921 --> 00:32:43.754
<v Speaker 3>because they're killing the cattle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're going to kill the cattle too </v>

729
00:32:46.390 --> 00:32:48.560
<v Speaker 3>if you want to have cattle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is what,</v>

730
00:32:48.620 --> 00:32:49.453
<v Speaker 3>this is the price you pay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I'm sure you've seen how they run </v>

731
00:32:51.891 --> 00:32:54.170
<v Speaker 3>cattle out here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just let them roam around on public</v>

732
00:32:54.171 --> 00:32:55.430
<v Speaker 3>land.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

733
00:32:55.431 --> 00:32:56.264
<v Speaker 3>when we were in Nevada,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were a deer hunting the Steven </v>

734
00:32:59.890 --> 00:33:01.850
<v Speaker 3>Rinella yet yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we saw a lot of deer.</v>

735
00:33:01.910 --> 00:33:04.550
<v Speaker 3>There's deer everywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we saw way more cows.</v>

736
00:33:04.850 --> 00:33:06.980
<v Speaker 3>Fucking cows are everywhere and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>

737
00:33:07.010 --> 00:33:12.010
<v Speaker 3>they roam all throughout this public </v>
<v Speaker 3>land and the ranchers pay some sort of a</v>

738
00:33:13.581 --> 00:33:15.650
<v Speaker 3>fee and they.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This was,</v>

739
00:33:15.670 --> 00:33:17.150
<v Speaker 3>that was what that whole thing was going</v>
<v Speaker 3>on.</v>

740
00:33:17.290 --> 00:33:18.123
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of that happens back home in </v>

741
00:33:19.071 --> 00:33:20.120
<v Speaker 3>Australia as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

742
00:33:20.121 --> 00:33:22.420
<v Speaker 3>So they roam all over the place.</v>

743
00:33:22.580 --> 00:33:24.830
<v Speaker 3>Just fucking cow shit everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're essentially,</v>

744
00:33:24.831 --> 00:33:27.170
<v Speaker 3>we're camping out so we're sleeping on </v>
<v Speaker 3>couches.</v>

745
00:33:27.190 --> 00:33:28.970
<v Speaker 3>There's no shit everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You live comfortable.</v>

746
00:33:29.620 --> 00:33:30.510
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't happening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The lox,</v>

747
00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:33.080
<v Speaker 3>spread it out a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I actually wound up sleeping in the back</v>

748
00:33:33.081 --> 00:33:35.450
<v Speaker 3>of the suburban.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We had a suburban and I was like,</v>

749
00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:37.280
<v Speaker 3>why are you guys going to sleep on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>ground?</v>

750
00:33:37.281 --> 00:33:40.130
<v Speaker 3>And you just fold the seats back asleep </v>
<v Speaker 3>on his flat area?</v>

751
00:33:40.131 --> 00:33:40.964
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I camped out in the back of a </v>

752
00:33:41.751 --> 00:33:46.080
<v Speaker 3>suburban while these dummies are </v>
<v Speaker 3>sleeping on the ground on cow patties.</v>

753
00:33:47.140 --> 00:33:50.570
<v Speaker 3>They want to be done with nature man </v>
<v Speaker 3>down with cap,</v>

754
00:33:50.571 --> 00:33:51.404
<v Speaker 3>who if you want to be down with nature,</v>
<v Speaker 3>take off the sleep you want to really </v>

755
00:33:54.231 --> 00:33:56.040
<v Speaker 3>get.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But exactly.</v>

756
00:33:56.041 --> 00:33:56.874
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's um,</v>

757
00:33:56.890 --> 00:33:58.070
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these animals,</v>

758
00:33:58.071 --> 00:34:01.160
<v Speaker 3>if you're going to let them wander </v>
<v Speaker 3>around like that roam free,</v>

759
00:34:01.161 --> 00:34:03.530
<v Speaker 3>which is nice because they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>essentially almost wild.</v>

760
00:34:03.860 --> 00:34:06.050
<v Speaker 3>They're free range cattle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're eating grass,</v>

761
00:34:06.290 --> 00:34:09.620
<v Speaker 3>so healthiest cattle you could eat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but wolves like to eat them too.</v>

762
00:34:09.820 --> 00:34:13.700
<v Speaker 3>And so it's a real tricky.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like where do you draw the line?</v>

763
00:34:13.701 --> 00:34:17.480
<v Speaker 3>There is not that many wounds and these </v>
<v Speaker 3>wolves are eating these cows and.</v>

764
00:34:17.780 --> 00:34:18.613
<v Speaker 3>But to the ranchers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>each cow is worth several thousand </v>

765
00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:24.740
<v Speaker 3>dollars every time a wolf kills a cow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a big loss of income.</v>

766
00:34:24.870 --> 00:34:27.110
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I suppose that's working.</v>

767
00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:28.153
<v Speaker 3>There's gotta be some sort of line there</v>
<v Speaker 3>where we work in conjunction with </v>

768
00:34:30.741 --> 00:34:32.630
<v Speaker 3>wildlife,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with your ranch or not.</v>

769
00:34:32.631 --> 00:34:36.050
<v Speaker 3>Whether you're losing income or not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

770
00:34:36.170 --> 00:34:37.003
<v Speaker 3>that's got to be part of the system and </v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe it should be subsidized by the </v>

771
00:34:39.561 --> 00:34:40.394
<v Speaker 3>taxpayers instead of killing the wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe they should subsidize some of </v>

772
00:34:43.341 --> 00:34:45.620
<v Speaker 3>these ranchers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean if these wolves are killing,</v>

773
00:34:45.980 --> 00:34:46.813
<v Speaker 3>it's only a certain amount as long as </v>
<v Speaker 3>they've taken some measure of </v>

774
00:34:50.181 --> 00:34:52.070
<v Speaker 3>protection,</v>
<v Speaker 3>try to keep the wolves away.</v>

775
00:34:52.070 --> 00:34:56.960
<v Speaker 3>But to ensure a healthy wolf population </v>
<v Speaker 3>would ensure a balanced ecosystem.</v>

776
00:34:57.140 --> 00:34:57.973
<v Speaker 3>See they can't bring it back to where </v>
<v Speaker 3>they used to be because where they used </v>

777
00:35:00.531 --> 00:35:01.520
<v Speaker 3>to be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was no wool.</v>

778
00:35:01.610 --> 00:35:02.301
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

779
00:35:02.301 --> 00:35:03.130
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

780
00:35:03.130 --> 00:35:04.910
<v Speaker 3>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a funny thing at home,</v>

781
00:35:05.210 --> 00:35:07.810
<v Speaker 3>how you sign it should be subsidized.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I always,</v>

782
00:35:07.830 --> 00:35:10.730
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my business is in northwestern Australia</v>

783
00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:14.810
<v Speaker 3>for the mines and they've got their own </v>
<v Speaker 3>private train law and they run their own</v>

784
00:35:14.900 --> 00:35:16.270
<v Speaker 3>trains.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've all I know.</v>

785
00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:17.713
<v Speaker 3>And the train lines on fence so the </v>
<v Speaker 3>cattle can cross the train line anytime </v>

786
00:35:20.871 --> 00:35:22.580
<v Speaker 3>of trying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's one of those cows,</v>

787
00:35:23.010 --> 00:35:24.390
<v Speaker 3>they've got to pay the farmer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

788
00:35:24.650 --> 00:35:25.483
<v Speaker 3>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I've heard stories about the Pharma </v>

789
00:35:26.730 --> 00:35:29.840
<v Speaker 3>just going out and shooting these cattle</v>
<v Speaker 3>along the train line.</v>

790
00:35:29.930 --> 00:35:33.060
<v Speaker 3>So the mines pay him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pay him for the cows,</v>

791
00:35:33.430 --> 00:35:34.790
<v Speaker 3>look like they've been hit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

792
00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:36.140
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty funny.</v>

793
00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:37.290
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's hilarious.</v>

794
00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:38.010
<v Speaker 3>So maybe we could do</v>

795
00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:38.843
<v Speaker 1>something like that with where the </v>
<v Speaker 1>wolves just pay out where every time </v>

796
00:35:40.651 --> 00:35:42.290
<v Speaker 1>they kill a cow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

797
00:35:42.310 --> 00:35:43.920
<v Speaker 1>Some people believe that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

798
00:35:43.921 --> 00:35:44.754
<v Speaker 1>someone would probably do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's probably some unscrupulous </v>

799
00:35:47.191 --> 00:35:48.024
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that didn't get caught and they'd </v>

800
00:35:49.081 --> 00:35:51.150
<v Speaker 1>get prosecuted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would balance itself out,</v>

801
00:35:51.510 --> 00:35:53.990
<v Speaker 1>but there's a certain amount of numbers </v>
<v Speaker 1>where they,</v>

802
00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:54.873
<v Speaker 1>the wolves reach a high population </v>
<v Speaker 1>number where all the other animals </v>

803
00:35:57.331 --> 00:35:58.164
<v Speaker 1>started getting threatened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there was a recent situation in </v>

804
00:36:00.091 --> 00:36:05.091
<v Speaker 1>Wyoming where these wolves killed 19 elk</v>
<v Speaker 1>and didn't even eat them.</v>

805
00:36:05.790 --> 00:36:07.500
<v Speaker 1>They just killed them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Real killing.</v>

806
00:36:07.501 --> 00:36:09.930
<v Speaker 1>Just fucking around having a good time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

807
00:36:09.990 --> 00:36:11.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They do that.</v>

808
00:36:11.790 --> 00:36:16.320
<v Speaker 2>That's the point where obviously we've </v>
<v Speaker 2>got to stand in my decision whether it's</v>

809
00:36:16.321 --> 00:36:18.630
<v Speaker 2>a tag system will or some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>calling.</v>

810
00:36:18.631 --> 00:36:20.880
<v Speaker 2>You know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think before the program we'll talk in</v>

811
00:36:20.881 --> 00:36:24.150
<v Speaker 2>about where kangaroos needed to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>called because it's,</v>

812
00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:25.560
<v Speaker 2>it's a little bit like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

813
00:36:25.710 --> 00:36:26.543
<v Speaker 2>So the Greens don't want to miss the </v>
<v Speaker 2>greenies that want to kill the </v>

814
00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:33.090
<v Speaker 2>Kangaroos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but for the benefit,</v>

815
00:36:33.660 --> 00:36:34.493
<v Speaker 2>for the better benefit of Kangaroos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it has to come a point where the </v>

816
00:36:37.261 --> 00:36:39.840
<v Speaker 2>numbers need to be controlled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise they ate,</v>

817
00:36:39.841 --> 00:36:40.674
<v Speaker 2>they sell out of land and home,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they get diseases and it takes weeks to </v>

818
00:36:44.671 --> 00:36:47.700
<v Speaker 2>die like a suffering death.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like now on one side.</v>

819
00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:50.190
<v Speaker 2>So you can't be just for one and not the</v>
<v Speaker 2>other.</v>

820
00:36:50.630 --> 00:36:54.110
<v Speaker 1>My Buddy Mike Hockridge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he lives up in BC,</v>

821
00:36:54.140 --> 00:36:56.030
<v Speaker 1>in northern BC,</v>
<v Speaker 1>British Columbia.</v>

822
00:36:56.090 --> 00:36:57.150
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

823
00:36:57.160 --> 00:37:00.980
<v Speaker 1>he was attacked by Wolf,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he had shot a wolf in mid air as it</v>

824
00:37:00.981 --> 00:37:01.814
<v Speaker 1>was jumping on them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have so many wolves up there that </v>

825
00:37:04.161 --> 00:37:06.620
<v Speaker 1>they have literally a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had open season.</v>

826
00:37:06.680 --> 00:37:09.020
<v Speaker 1>Like there's no tag limits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could shoot wolves.</v>

827
00:37:09.110 --> 00:37:11.090
<v Speaker 1>Sounds like to go there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

828
00:37:11.091 --> 00:37:13.120
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we went up there and this is a,</v>

829
00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:14.810
<v Speaker 1>we were moose hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where I got this one.</v>

830
00:37:15.140 --> 00:37:18.320
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we found a calf that had been torn apart</v>

831
00:37:18.321 --> 00:37:22.100
<v Speaker 1>by wolves and it's really fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he put this up on his instagram,</v>

832
00:37:22.280 --> 00:37:23.113
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

833
00:37:23.300 --> 00:37:27.260
<v Speaker 1>his instagram is BC outfitter pcf.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is him last night.</v>

834
00:37:27.340 --> 00:37:28.220
<v Speaker 1>Listen to this shit.</v>

835
00:37:29.610 --> 00:37:30.630
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's awesome.</v>

836
00:37:31.300 --> 00:37:32.320
<v Speaker 1>This is just last night.</v>

837
00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:44.160
<v Speaker 2>It'd be hell and back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Come in by me and say what happened?</v>

838
00:37:44.161 --> 00:37:45.990
<v Speaker 2>Started.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He actually started it.</v>

839
00:37:46.050 --> 00:37:48.390
<v Speaker 2>He started the howl.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can hear it here.</v>

840
00:37:48.860 --> 00:37:49.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He called him.</v>

841
00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:51.340
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's it.</v>

842
00:38:00.790 --> 00:38:01.623
<v Speaker 2>That's a theory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That sand when you're in camp by </v>

843
00:38:03.401 --> 00:38:04.450
<v Speaker 2>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you hear that.</v>

844
00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:05.753
<v Speaker 2>I ran.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yah.</v>

845
00:38:05.820 --> 00:38:08.560
<v Speaker 2>That's what a fucking awesome in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>area.</v>

846
00:38:08.561 --> 00:38:12.120
<v Speaker 2>At the same time animal ever because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're smart.</v>

847
00:38:12.150 --> 00:38:16.660
<v Speaker 2>You operate in packs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have really complex social system.</v>

848
00:38:16.780 --> 00:38:19.580
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you these cool little story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I was in northwest territory,</v>

849
00:38:19.581 --> 00:38:20.414
<v Speaker 2>good luck just above the arctic circle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first time I've been in the country </v>

850
00:38:22.871 --> 00:38:26.080
<v Speaker 2>like the Mckenzie Mountains and I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually hunting Moose,</v>

851
00:38:26.081 --> 00:38:30.190
<v Speaker 2>but I had a wolf tag as well and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>very first morning like we get up out of</v>

852
00:38:30.191 --> 00:38:32.380
<v Speaker 2>the tent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we walk up the river and with a guide,</v>

853
00:38:32.390 --> 00:38:33.223
<v Speaker 2>Byron and I say it like a pack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wolves coming down the river and so </v>

854
00:38:36.941 --> 00:38:40.630
<v Speaker 2>they'd been hunting that area I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>ended up being day three.</v>

855
00:38:40.631 --> 00:38:41.464
<v Speaker 2>They.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They chased the Caribou up and down the </v>

856
00:38:42.821 --> 00:38:45.250
<v Speaker 2>river like just to a levering sweat.</v>

857
00:38:45.670 --> 00:38:46.503
<v Speaker 2>Then like chase in the river and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>surrendered that didn't the with the </v>

858
00:38:48.461 --> 00:38:51.430
<v Speaker 2>river and that Caribou and was a bull as</v>
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

859
00:38:51.730 --> 00:38:52.563
<v Speaker 2>Got to the point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's whole body was quivering because </v>

860
00:38:53.891 --> 00:38:58.450
<v Speaker 2>it's been really hot and then it's been </v>
<v Speaker 2>chased into this freezing cold river.</v>

861
00:38:59.170 --> 00:39:00.003
<v Speaker 2>At that point the wolves just left it </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they all went up and sat in the sun </v>

862
00:39:02.561 --> 00:39:03.394
<v Speaker 2>because they a wet as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They went and sat in the sun and I got </v>

863
00:39:06.131 --> 00:39:09.160
<v Speaker 2>old dry and then it was like mother </v>
<v Speaker 2>nature just took over.</v>

864
00:39:09.161 --> 00:39:09.994
<v Speaker 2>From that point they they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they got the Caribou to the point where </v>

865
00:39:12.011 --> 00:39:12.844
<v Speaker 2>they knew it was going to die and left </v>
<v Speaker 2>it and ended up I couldn't hold its own </v>

866
00:39:15.271 --> 00:39:18.730
<v Speaker 2>legs up and end up laying down in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>river and drowned in the river.</v>

867
00:39:19.780 --> 00:39:21.400
<v Speaker 2>How cool is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That they knew that,</v>

868
00:39:21.880 --> 00:39:22.713
<v Speaker 2>so the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The wolves get to the point where </v>

869
00:39:23.801 --> 00:39:24.311
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

870
00:39:24.311 --> 00:39:26.140
<v Speaker 2>we're going to go and sit in the sun now</v>
<v Speaker 2>and dry out.</v>

871
00:39:26.170 --> 00:39:27.280
<v Speaker 2>This thing's dead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>

872
00:39:27.281 --> 00:39:29.800
<v Speaker 2>we're just kind of come back to it now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once it's drowned in the river,</v>

873
00:39:29.980 --> 00:39:32.080
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do they know that?</v>

874
00:39:32.081 --> 00:39:32.690
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>

875
00:39:32.690 --> 00:39:37.050
<v Speaker 2>And then by that afternoon that Caribou </v>
<v Speaker 2>was just a ribcage.</v>

876
00:39:37.290 --> 00:39:38.123
<v Speaker 2>Like they just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they absolutely plucked every bit of </v>

877
00:39:39.921 --> 00:39:41.900
<v Speaker 2>meat and organs out of that Caribou.</v>

878
00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:43.610
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How cool is that?</v>

879
00:39:43.910 --> 00:39:46.320
<v Speaker 3>I've got photos of it actually.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do real work.</v>

880
00:39:46.490 --> 00:39:47.323
<v Speaker 3>Do you have online anywhere?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They probably all my instagram early </v>

881
00:39:49.990 --> 00:39:50.590
<v Speaker 3>days.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Instagram.</v>

882
00:39:50.590 --> 00:39:51.423
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So Adam Green tree bone and tag them on </v>

883
00:39:53.121 --> 00:39:53.980
<v Speaker 3>my instagram.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if,</v>

884
00:39:53.990 --> 00:39:56.060
<v Speaker 3>see if you could find those champions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>

885
00:39:56.090 --> 00:39:59.600
<v Speaker 3>you'll see these Caribou just standing </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the water and I'm like,</v>

886
00:39:59.660 --> 00:40:01.300
<v Speaker 3>it was just quivering.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>

887
00:40:01.430 --> 00:40:02.760
<v Speaker 3>it was done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was done.</v>

888
00:40:02.761 --> 00:40:04.370
<v Speaker 3>And I knew that it was done and they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>just like,</v>

889
00:40:04.371 --> 00:40:06.470
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll come back in an hour and a fucking</v>

890
00:40:06.471 --> 00:40:09.640
<v Speaker 3>smarter than fucking smarter than.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cool.</v>

891
00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:13.430
<v Speaker 3>Have you also heard that in their spore?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

892
00:40:14.450 --> 00:40:16.420
<v Speaker 3>there's um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something</v>

893
00:40:16.530 --> 00:40:17.880
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like elk,</v>

894
00:40:17.881 --> 00:40:20.280
<v Speaker 2>if they sniff it stays in the dirt </v>
<v Speaker 2>forever.</v>

895
00:40:20.281 --> 00:40:23.100
<v Speaker 2>So they basically shoot it out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stays in the dirt forever.</v>

896
00:40:23.370 --> 00:40:26.430
<v Speaker 2>An elk will go long grazing and eat the </v>
<v Speaker 2>grass.</v>

897
00:40:26.490 --> 00:40:29.090
<v Speaker 2>And this spore attacks the elks lungs in</v>
<v Speaker 2>drinks,</v>

898
00:40:29.100 --> 00:40:30.600
<v Speaker 2>the lung capacity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>

899
00:40:30.750 --> 00:40:31.583
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

900
00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:34.110
<v Speaker 2>it basically makes the elk tired when </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're</v>

901
00:40:34.160 --> 00:40:37.160
<v Speaker 3>running for the wolf to grab them at a </v>
<v Speaker 3>later date.</v>

902
00:40:37.700 --> 00:40:39.100
<v Speaker 3>Wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then we looked,</v>

903
00:40:39.110 --> 00:40:42.440
<v Speaker 3>they thought they shit out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The what,</v>

904
00:40:42.550 --> 00:40:43.383
<v Speaker 3>what they ate and spores spores are </v>
<v Speaker 3>released into the dirt when the elk </v>

905
00:40:48.080 --> 00:40:49.790
<v Speaker 3>eating,</v>
<v Speaker 3>eating the grass.</v>

906
00:40:49.940 --> 00:40:54.380
<v Speaker 3>Like they take it into their system and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it produces their lung capacity,</v>

907
00:40:54.381 --> 00:40:55.214
<v Speaker 3>reduces their lung capacity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's like they're poisoning the well </v>

908
00:40:57.781 --> 00:40:58.614
<v Speaker 3>before they jack them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that not the ultimate Predator or </v>

909
00:41:01.341 --> 00:41:03.130
<v Speaker 3>not?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

910
00:41:03.590 --> 00:41:06.230
<v Speaker 3>How is nature so complex?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's cool,</v>

911
00:41:06.231 --> 00:41:07.520
<v Speaker 3>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

912
00:41:07.580 --> 00:41:10.480
<v Speaker 3>the thing about wolves now too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really kind of cool to see.</v>

913
00:41:10.550 --> 00:41:11.383
<v Speaker 3>I'm so torn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm so torn because on one hand I love </v>

914
00:41:13.971 --> 00:41:15.410
<v Speaker 3>elk hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love elk.</v>

915
00:41:15.411 --> 00:41:17.600
<v Speaker 3>I love the idea that they're out there </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they're wild.</v>

916
00:41:17.990 --> 00:41:22.040
<v Speaker 3>But I'm a big fan of wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love the fact that these wolves are so</v>

917
00:41:22.041 --> 00:41:25.430
<v Speaker 3>fucking bad ass ranch is right now gone.</v>

918
00:41:25.460 --> 00:41:26.980
<v Speaker 3>Fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joe Rogan.</v>

919
00:41:27.500 --> 00:41:28.330
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my friend Mike,</v>

<v Speaker 3>his neighbors ranch gang of them jumped </v>

<v Speaker 3>they got hungry and that winter and they</v>

922
00:41:36.081 --> 00:41:36.561
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

923
00:41:36.561 --> 00:41:39.380
<v Speaker 3>let's just fucking do this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How much easier of a feed is that?</v>

924
00:41:39.650 --> 00:41:42.050
<v Speaker 3>Pretty easy nail that runs flood out </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's got legs,</v>

925
00:41:42.051 --> 00:41:43.590
<v Speaker 3>that standard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the grant effect,</v>

926
00:41:43.670 --> 00:41:46.100
<v Speaker 3>Kale that's down here that might even </v>
<v Speaker 3>run away,</v>

927
00:41:46.130 --> 00:41:46.963
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a pendant to the ELC was pinned in </v>

928
00:41:50.270 --> 00:41:51.920
<v Speaker 3>or the cow rather was coming in and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

929
00:41:51.921 --> 00:41:53.050
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they jumped on,</v>

930
00:41:53.570 --> 00:41:54.560
<v Speaker 3>jumped the fence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess,</v>

931
00:41:54.561 --> 00:41:58.580
<v Speaker 3>and this is one of the things that's so </v>
<v Speaker 3>appealing to me about bow hunting.</v>

932
00:41:58.581 --> 00:42:00.860
<v Speaker 3>It's not actually just bow hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the holiday though.</v>

933
00:42:01.040 --> 00:42:01.873
<v Speaker 3>Whole pitcher and wildlife.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you get into it like this and you </v>

934
00:42:04.911 --> 00:42:06.620
<v Speaker 3>start looking at it and thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

935
00:42:06.650 --> 00:42:08.420
<v Speaker 3>it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who doesn't want to be a part of that?</v>

936
00:42:08.780 --> 00:42:09.613
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're so filtered from it for the most </v>

937
00:42:10.851 --> 00:42:11.684
<v Speaker 3>part,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most people's interaction with wild </v>

938
00:42:13.221 --> 00:42:16.880
<v Speaker 3>animals in the zoo or a squirrel who </v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

939
00:42:16.881 --> 00:42:20.120
<v Speaker 3>I see a skunk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's an eagle.</v>

940
00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:22.100
<v Speaker 3>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my gosh.</v>

941
00:42:22.101 --> 00:42:25.010
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw an eagle like it's a big day,</v>

942
00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:30.400
<v Speaker 3>but to actually go to a place like where</v>
<v Speaker 3>you went and to hear well,</v>

943
00:42:31.190 --> 00:42:32.750
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people always like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

944
00:42:32.751 --> 00:42:33.880
<v Speaker 3>that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>

945
00:42:34.190 --> 00:42:35.023
<v Speaker 3>It's actually not that crazy when you go</v>
<v Speaker 3>out and experience that sort of things </v>

946
00:42:37.310 --> 00:42:38.143
<v Speaker 3>happening all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just that people are so </v>

947
00:42:40.101 --> 00:42:42.680
<v Speaker 3>disconnected because they're not out </v>
<v Speaker 3>there experiencing it.</v>

948
00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:44.033
<v Speaker 3>I was telling a story,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we're going to wedgetail illegal at </v>

949
00:42:45.681 --> 00:42:48.440
<v Speaker 3>home and I can hear these pig squeal and</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

950
00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:50.510
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a lock.</v>

951
00:42:50.520 --> 00:42:51.353
<v Speaker 3>My knees just can't pick up where these </v>
<v Speaker 3>peak school and coming from and it's </v>

952
00:42:53.300 --> 00:42:54.620
<v Speaker 3>going straight over the top of my head.</v>

953
00:42:54.620 --> 00:42:55.453
<v Speaker 3>There's a which title?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Legal with this pig and it flies it </v>

954
00:42:57.561 --> 00:42:58.394
<v Speaker 3>over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It knew exactly what it was doing and </v>

955
00:43:00.380 --> 00:43:01.213
<v Speaker 3>flies that gets it up real high and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>drops it perfectly over this rocky </v>

956
00:43:04.041 --> 00:43:08.060
<v Speaker 3>outcrop on the mountain to open it up </v>
<v Speaker 3>like that stock,</v>

957
00:43:08.070 --> 00:43:08.903
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You gone.</v>

958
00:43:09.080 --> 00:43:11.600
<v Speaker 3>I need a steak knife to cut into the </v>
<v Speaker 3>meat.</v>

959
00:43:11.900 --> 00:43:13.600
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was just gone on eight,</v>

960
00:43:13.610 --> 00:43:16.400
<v Speaker 3>a rocky outcrop to cut into this meat </v>
<v Speaker 3>and potatoes.</v>

961
00:43:16.401 --> 00:43:18.530
<v Speaker 3>The pig.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was pretty decent.</v>

962
00:43:18.590 --> 00:43:20.180
<v Speaker 3>It was like this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like 40 pounds,</v>

963
00:43:20.181 --> 00:43:21.350
<v Speaker 3>50 pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>40 pounds,</v>

964
00:43:21.351 --> 00:43:26.090
<v Speaker 3>maybe 30.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've seen them drop goats off cliffs,</v>

965
00:43:26.450 --> 00:43:27.283
<v Speaker 3>like the goats are climbing cliffs and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Eagle swoops down and grabs a hold </v>

966
00:43:29.541 --> 00:43:30.374
<v Speaker 3>of it and how bad that video with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Eagle tries to pick up the baby out of </v>

967
00:43:34.851 --> 00:43:36.860
<v Speaker 3>the pram or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's real,</v>

968
00:43:37.100 --> 00:43:37.840
<v Speaker 3>don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

969
00:43:37.840 --> 00:43:39.920
<v Speaker 3>I think that's fake Internet.</v>

970
00:43:41.390 --> 00:43:44.530
<v Speaker 3>Seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure it's probably happened before.</v>

971
00:43:45.050 --> 00:43:47.660
<v Speaker 3>Definitely happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you look in the eye of an eagle,</v>

972
00:43:47.690 --> 00:43:48.530
<v Speaker 3>you realize,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah,</v>

973
00:43:48.531 --> 00:43:49.670
<v Speaker 3>the thing would eat a baby.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

974
00:43:49.950 --> 00:43:52.700
<v Speaker 3>I think the idea that it would need a </v>
<v Speaker 3>baby's a joke they had built for it.</v>

975
00:43:52.701 --> 00:43:54.080
<v Speaker 3>It's just another animal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

976
00:43:54.081 --> 00:43:55.100
<v Speaker 3>They don't give a fuck kid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

977
00:43:55.220 --> 00:43:56.890
<v Speaker 3>no offense to anyone's babies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>

978
00:43:57.050 --> 00:43:57.883
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The reality is there's a great video of </v>

979
00:44:01.491 --> 00:44:02.324
<v Speaker 3>this guy in Alaska.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've played it on the podcast for the </v>

980
00:44:04.731 --> 00:44:08.720
<v Speaker 3>guy with all the eagles in his yard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eagles in Alaska are so prevalent.</v>

981
00:44:08.920 --> 00:44:11.270
<v Speaker 3>I have a friend who goes up there and </v>
<v Speaker 3>she was telling me that they're like,</v>

982
00:44:11.271 --> 00:44:12.670
<v Speaker 3>pigeons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's like,</v>

983
00:44:12.671 --> 00:44:14.120
<v Speaker 3>they're like fucking pigeons were </v>
<v Speaker 3>everywhere.</v>

<v Speaker 3>like these fucking things out here with </v>

<v Speaker 3>backyard he's got fucking hundreds and </v>

986
00:44:24.320 --> 00:44:25.153
<v Speaker 3>hundreds of eagles.</v>

987
00:44:25.220 --> 00:44:28.400
<v Speaker 3>I mean maybe not hundreds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>150,</v>

988
00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:30.930
<v Speaker 3>15 ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>10:30,</v>

989
00:44:32.580 --> 00:44:34.800
<v Speaker 3>but they're fucking everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is this the video?</v>

990
00:44:34.840 --> 00:44:36.480
<v Speaker 3>So this is the same one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what it is,</v>

991
00:44:36.481 --> 00:44:38.940
<v Speaker 3>is he's got a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>where did I come up with hundreds?</v>

992
00:44:39.060 --> 00:44:39.893
<v Speaker 3>How dare me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he's got a bunch of fish that he's </v>

993
00:44:42.211 --> 00:44:44.950
<v Speaker 3>got laid out and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've got it.</v>

994
00:44:44.951 --> 00:44:45.784
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at this,</v>

995
00:44:45.840 --> 00:44:48.630
<v Speaker 3>look at all these fucking eagles just </v>
<v Speaker 3>walking around this guy's backyard.</v>

996
00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:51.780
<v Speaker 3>This ain't shit compared to what we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to show you in a minute folks.</v>

997
00:44:52.230 --> 00:44:53.063
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these eagles are wandering around this </v>

998
00:44:55.051 --> 00:44:59.880
<v Speaker 3>guy's yard and he has his kid take a </v>
<v Speaker 3>bucket of fish and dump it out for these</v>

999
00:44:59.881 --> 00:45:00.714
<v Speaker 3>eagles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I just would not be that confident </v>

1000
00:45:04.110 --> 00:45:06.770
<v Speaker 3>having these fucking monsters coming </v>
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>

1001
00:45:06.780 --> 00:45:08.090
<v Speaker 3>My kids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1002
00:45:08.091 --> 00:45:10.830
<v Speaker 3>that'd be a sort of raptors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1003
00:45:11.710 --> 00:45:15.070
<v Speaker 3>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know that saying video.</v>

1004
00:45:15.071 --> 00:45:15.990
<v Speaker 3>Grab each one of them.</v>

1005
00:45:16.170 --> 00:45:17.580
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at this thing.</v>

1006
00:45:17.900 --> 00:45:22.590
<v Speaker 3>There is so weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's such a weird animal that's a living</v>

1007
00:45:22.591 --> 00:45:23.670
<v Speaker 3>dinosaur.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1008
00:45:23.730 --> 00:45:24.780
<v Speaker 3>it really is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1009
00:45:25.320 --> 00:45:28.630
<v Speaker 3>It's such a weird animal too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just so strange.</v>

1010
00:45:28.631 --> 00:45:31.560
<v Speaker 3>And we chose that heartless monster is </v>
<v Speaker 3>the American bird,</v>

1011
00:45:32.460 --> 00:45:33.210
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1012
00:45:33.210 --> 00:45:34.043
<v Speaker 3>couldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Couldn't be American animal would be </v>

1013
00:45:34.771 --> 00:45:38.130
<v Speaker 3>like a puppy or something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've got on our coins,</v>

<v Speaker 3>And wombat.</v>

1015
00:45:39.910 --> 00:45:43.380
<v Speaker 3>Nothing would take nothing close.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a good move because this thing is</v>

1016
00:45:43.381 --> 00:45:48.210
<v Speaker 3>just living dinosaur,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like literally a raptor of flying raptor</v>

00:45:49.050 --> 00:45:50.840
<v Speaker 3>look at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just creep once,</v>

1018
00:45:50.940 --> 00:45:53.400
<v Speaker 3>once that fish but doesn't want to take </v>
<v Speaker 3>a chance of getting shot.</v>

1021
00:45:58.021 --> 00:45:58.854

1022
00:46:01.440 --> 00:46:04.380
<v Speaker 3>hang around up there and whenever we </v>
<v Speaker 3>kill a deer we leave the coc and say,</v>

<v Speaker 3>One at a zoo here that has all this mold</v>

1068
00:47:56.381 --> 00:47:58.580
<v Speaker 3>grow all over its back and you can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1069
00:47:58.720 --> 00:47:59.553
<v Speaker 3>look at it right there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the ones because they move so </v>

1070
00:48:01.691 --> 00:48:05.560
<v Speaker 3>slow that literally moss and shit can </v>
<v Speaker 3>grow on them.</v>

1071
00:48:06.040 --> 00:48:08.530
<v Speaker 3>What a fucking goofy ass productive </v>
<v Speaker 3>jaimee.</v>

1072
00:48:08.531 --> 00:48:10.540
<v Speaker 3>I like synergy sight sound.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like boom.</v>

1073
00:48:10.570 --> 00:48:13.690
<v Speaker 3>He's the best.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The best man.</v>

1074
00:48:13.750 --> 00:48:15.640
<v Speaker 3>He needs another one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Another race,</v>

1075
00:48:15.700 --> 00:48:17.830
<v Speaker 3>another raise for changing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at this fucking thing,</v>

1076
00:48:17.980 --> 00:48:21.490
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that doesn't even look real.</v>

1077
00:48:21.740 --> 00:48:23.800
<v Speaker 3>If you told me that that was a creature </v>
<v Speaker 3>in a movie,</v>

1078
00:48:23.830 --> 00:48:25.090
<v Speaker 3>I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's going to come and get you.</v>

1079
00:48:25.091 --> 00:48:29.380
<v Speaker 3>That's the boogie monster comes in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>middle of the night.</v>

1080
00:48:32.080 --> 00:48:35.050
<v Speaker 3>He already eats babies and that's what </v>
<v Speaker 3>it looks like.</v>

1081
00:48:35.340 --> 00:48:36.173
<v Speaker 3>It looks like some fake crazy that </v>
<v Speaker 3>technology has brought us this fall </v>

1082
00:48:38.770 --> 00:48:41.550
<v Speaker 3>where we can look at a video right now </v>
<v Speaker 3>at that slaw.</v>

1083
00:48:41.680 --> 00:48:43.930
<v Speaker 3>But to tell you the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you hadn't traveled the world,</v>

1084
00:48:43.990 --> 00:48:46.120
<v Speaker 3>you wouldn't even know that animal </v>
<v Speaker 3>really existed.</v>

1085
00:48:46.330 --> 00:48:47.163
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's why they used to have to have </v>

1086
00:48:47.591 --> 00:48:48.424
<v Speaker 3>zoos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's one of the main reasons why I'm </v>

1087
00:48:49.271 --> 00:48:50.700
<v Speaker 3>opposed to zoos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1088
00:48:50.830 --> 00:48:51.491
<v Speaker 3>I mean I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

1089
00:48:51.491 --> 00:48:52.324
<v Speaker 3>I'm pro zoo as far as like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they raise a lot of money for </v>

1090
00:48:54.401 --> 00:48:55.234
<v Speaker 3>conservation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's some animals that actually </v>

1091
00:48:56.921 --> 00:48:57.754
<v Speaker 3>thrive in zoos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like we were joking around about it the </v>

1092
00:48:59.351 --> 00:49:02.650
<v Speaker 3>other day about giraffes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I used to have this joke in my act about</v>

1093
00:49:02.651 --> 00:49:04.630
<v Speaker 3>giraffes don't give a fuck about being </v>
<v Speaker 3>the zoo.</v>

1094
00:49:04.631 --> 00:49:06.310
<v Speaker 3>They don't feel bad at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They love it.</v>

1095
00:49:06.700 --> 00:49:07.533
<v Speaker 3>They just wander around going another </v>
<v Speaker 3>day and then just slowly walk around </v>

1096
00:49:12.070 --> 00:49:13.500
<v Speaker 3>because drafts are the only animal.</v>

1097
00:49:13.690 --> 00:49:14.523
<v Speaker 3>You let babies feed them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what if they don't realize that got </v>

1098
00:49:17.141 --> 00:49:18.900
<v Speaker 3>life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that good luck us today.</v>

1099
00:49:19.320 --> 00:49:20.153
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it takes a back country hunt for </v>

1100
00:49:21.191 --> 00:49:22.750
<v Speaker 3>you to go home and go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shit,</v>

1101
00:49:22.780 --> 00:49:24.490
<v Speaker 3>I just flick a switch and a light comes </v>
<v Speaker 3>on.</v>

1102
00:49:24.660 --> 00:49:25.493
<v Speaker 3>Any type of hot water comes on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those drives are probably just ignorant </v>

1103
00:49:28.601 --> 00:49:29.890
<v Speaker 3>and I really don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

1104
00:49:29.980 --> 00:49:33.370
<v Speaker 3>They definitely know they've got a good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's not lions chasing them everyday.</v>

1105
00:49:33.560 --> 00:49:35.560
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's fucked up about the Santa Barbara</v>

1106
00:49:35.560 --> 00:49:36.700
<v Speaker 3>Zoo?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Santa Barbara Zoo is great,</v>

1107
00:49:36.760 --> 00:49:37.593
<v Speaker 3>but the fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the a giraffe cage is right next to the </v>

1108
00:49:41.921 --> 00:49:44.810
<v Speaker 3>lion cage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like literally is that tear?</v>

1109
00:49:44.811 --> 00:49:45.730
<v Speaker 3>Remind them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>boy,</v>

1110
00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:49.480
<v Speaker 3>this is what it could be like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what they should do.</v>

1111
00:49:49.780 --> 00:49:52.630
<v Speaker 3>They should let them out for a week.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They should let him out for a week.</v>

1112
00:49:52.631 --> 00:49:56.260
<v Speaker 3>Let lines and shit chased him around,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let them back into zero and go see.</v>

1113
00:49:56.310 --> 00:49:57.850
<v Speaker 3>That's what it could be like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you want?</v>

1114
00:49:58.060 --> 00:49:59.860
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stop being such an asshole.</v>

1115
00:50:00.310 --> 00:50:02.200
<v Speaker 3>He let us live.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But look at this,</v>

1116
00:50:02.201 --> 00:50:04.840
<v Speaker 3>people can feed them and look at that </v>
<v Speaker 3>little kid.</v>

1117
00:50:05.140 --> 00:50:07.750
<v Speaker 3>No one's even remotely worried about the</v>
<v Speaker 3>behavior of giraffes.</v>

1118
00:50:07.751 --> 00:50:09.710
<v Speaker 3>They've never exhibited any aggressive </v>
<v Speaker 3>behavior.</v>

1119
00:50:10.210 --> 00:50:12.610
<v Speaker 3>Katie looked a bit stressed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He just didn't know.</v>

1120
00:50:13.210 --> 00:50:15.040
<v Speaker 3>He's just maybe a little pissy about </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1121
00:50:16.640 --> 00:50:19.930
<v Speaker 3>Kids going to grow up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but Jitsu kick your ass.</v>

1122
00:50:19.931 --> 00:50:23.020
<v Speaker 3>I don't think he's got more than Jujitsu</v>
<v Speaker 3>for a giraffe.</v>

1123
00:50:23.940 --> 00:50:24.870
<v Speaker 3>Ninety,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd be raw.</v>

1124
00:50:24.910 --> 00:50:27.980
<v Speaker 3>You need a hoist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So these giraffes are right</v>

1125
00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:28.813
<v Speaker 1>next to this fucking cage where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there are only separated by a </v>

1126
00:50:31.461 --> 00:50:32.294
<v Speaker 1>couple of fences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's two fences and right over there </v>

1127
00:50:34.161 --> 00:50:35.960
<v Speaker 1>as these lionesses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's all.</v>

1128
00:50:36.050 --> 00:50:37.730
<v Speaker 1>And you can get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have fit glass.</v>

1129
00:50:37.731 --> 00:50:39.770
<v Speaker 1>You can get right like where you are to </v>
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>

1130
00:50:39.771 --> 00:50:42.440
<v Speaker 1>you can get right up to the line,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you get right up to them,</v>

1131
00:50:42.441 --> 00:50:45.380
<v Speaker 1>you feel so vulnerable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you know there's glass,</v>

1132
00:50:45.381 --> 00:50:48.850
<v Speaker 1>but that cat's looking at you and you'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>let your whole body just starts going,</v>

1133
00:50:48.890 --> 00:50:50.620
<v Speaker 1>get the fuck out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We should.</v>

1134
00:50:50.940 --> 00:50:53.070
<v Speaker 1>That's your instinct,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

1135
00:50:53.150 --> 00:50:55.130
<v Speaker 1>What are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1136
00:50:55.131 --> 00:50:56.910
<v Speaker 1>there's something about cats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1137
00:50:56.930 --> 00:50:59.840
<v Speaker 1>you've seen this one where this baby is </v>
<v Speaker 1>standing there.</v>

1138
00:51:00.260 --> 00:51:03.800
<v Speaker 1>It turns its back and the lion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lion can't even help it.</v>

1139
00:51:04.150 --> 00:51:05.570
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just the instinct.</v>

1140
00:51:05.571 --> 00:51:07.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But as soon as the kid turns its back,</v>

1141
00:51:07.911 --> 00:51:08.950
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1142
00:51:10.820 --> 00:51:13.040
<v Speaker 1>fuck man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>

1143
00:51:13.220 --> 00:51:15.230
<v Speaker 1>Did you see any mountain lions when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're out there?</v>

1144
00:51:15.890 --> 00:51:19.380
<v Speaker 2>A one count into the kill site.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's Prince role for the snow there.</v>

1145
00:51:19.710 --> 00:51:20.401
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1146
00:51:20.401 --> 00:51:23.070
<v Speaker 2>and that country's pretty known for </v>
<v Speaker 2>mountain lions as well.</v>

1147
00:51:23.430 --> 00:51:26.460
<v Speaker 2>A two or three years ago when I was in </v>
<v Speaker 2>there and we've got fresh.</v>

1148
00:51:26.461 --> 00:51:27.750
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I went right up high.</v>

1149
00:51:28.070 --> 00:51:31.040
<v Speaker 2>I'm big mountain tracks like in that </v>
<v Speaker 2>space because there was fresh.</v>

1150
00:51:31.041 --> 00:51:32.940
<v Speaker 2>Now I'm sure there's fresh mountain </v>
<v Speaker 2>tracks everywhere.</v>

1151
00:51:32.941 --> 00:51:33.774
<v Speaker 2>I walked everyday,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's just that there was fresh snow </v>

1152
00:51:35.461 --> 00:51:37.260
<v Speaker 2>and it left the tracks perfectly in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>snow.</v>

1153
00:51:37.710 --> 00:51:41.550
<v Speaker 2>Like how many times do you walk past the</v>
<v Speaker 2>mountain lion and staring at your.</v>

1154
00:51:41.551 --> 00:51:42.384
<v Speaker 2>How many times has it been a mountain </v>
<v Speaker 2>lion off in the distance looking at Ya </v>

1155
00:51:44.540 --> 00:51:45.373
<v Speaker 2>and you had no idea it was there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't know they're there and then </v>

1156
00:51:47.251 --> 00:51:52.140
<v Speaker 2>every now and then you'll get a weird </v>
<v Speaker 2>feeling like I'm being funny sense.</v>

1157
00:51:52.141 --> 00:51:53.910
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I hate saying it because people will</v>

1158
00:51:53.911 --> 00:51:54.744
<v Speaker 2>say bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'll get a funny feeling that </v>

1159
00:51:56.851 --> 00:51:59.340
<v Speaker 2>someone's looking at me and if I stopped</v>
<v Speaker 2>at that point and have a look around,</v>

1160
00:51:59.370 --> 00:52:00.203
<v Speaker 2>chances are I'll find a deer or a fox or</v>
<v Speaker 2>something staring at me from in the up </v>

1161
00:52:05.371 --> 00:52:07.110
<v Speaker 2>on the ridge or in the timber or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

1162
00:52:07.140 --> 00:52:08.070
<v Speaker 2>Happened with Shane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dorian.</v>

1163
00:52:08.071 --> 00:52:09.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shane on the show not long ago,</v>

1164
00:52:10.020 --> 00:52:10.853
<v Speaker 2>Shane was out hunting with me just </v>
<v Speaker 2>before he come on your show and I </v>

1165
00:52:14.071 --> 00:52:14.904
<v Speaker 2>stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1166
00:52:15.090 --> 00:52:15.923
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just got this weird feeling of being </v>

1167
00:52:16.651 --> 00:52:18.210
<v Speaker 2>watched and we looked around and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1168
00:52:18.211 --> 00:52:20.310
<v Speaker 2>there's a box like looking beyond the </v>
<v Speaker 2>three,</v>

1169
00:52:20.340 --> 00:52:21.660
<v Speaker 2>staring straight at us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1170
00:52:21.661 --> 00:52:23.640
<v Speaker 2>so it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it tickles a sense,</v>

1171
00:52:23.641 --> 00:52:24.260
<v Speaker 2>that's for sure.</v>

1172
00:52:24.260 --> 00:52:25.240
<v Speaker 1>Do you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1173
00:52:25.250 --> 00:52:30.250
<v Speaker 1>this is going to get into the womb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that when you're out in the</v>

1174
00:52:31.731 --> 00:52:36.731
<v Speaker 1>woods for days on end a week on end with</v>
<v Speaker 1>no cell phone service?</v>

1175
00:52:37.700 --> 00:52:38.660
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>

1176
00:52:38.900 --> 00:52:43.610
<v Speaker 1>Just quiet woods and animals and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>alone.</v>

1177
00:52:43.640 --> 00:52:44.473
<v Speaker 1>It's just you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that activates certain </v>

1178
00:52:46.371 --> 00:52:49.460
<v Speaker 1>senses or reignite certain centers that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are dormant?</v>

1179
00:52:49.461 --> 00:52:50.294
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ignites</v>

1180
00:52:50.360 --> 00:52:51.193
<v Speaker 2>really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We kind of gone for such a long period </v>

1181
00:52:53.091 --> 00:52:55.390
<v Speaker 2>where you had to hunt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1182
00:52:55.580 --> 00:52:56.930
<v Speaker 2>that's just how people were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1183
00:52:56.931 --> 00:52:57.764
<v Speaker 2>like the natural world is people out in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the woods just like with the animals </v>

1184
00:53:02.750 --> 00:53:03.583
<v Speaker 2>that all that ignites and it fades when </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're looking at frigging technology </v>

1185
00:53:07.581 --> 00:53:11.870
<v Speaker 2>like we do or you're so busy in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>lifestyle and what you in what you do,</v>

1186
00:53:11.871 --> 00:53:14.040
<v Speaker 2>like obviously parts of the body's got </v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

1187
00:53:14.220 --> 00:53:15.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we to shut this down.</v>

1188
00:53:15.591 --> 00:53:16.590
<v Speaker 2>We're doing this now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1189
00:53:16.591 --> 00:53:19.340
<v Speaker 2>we're moving forward in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>move forward in the world.</v>

1190
00:53:19.341 --> 00:53:20.360
<v Speaker 2>Bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's move back.</v>

1191
00:53:21.530 --> 00:53:24.020
<v Speaker 2>That definitely ignites and it's what I </v>
<v Speaker 2>just said,</v>

1192
00:53:24.110 --> 00:53:24.943
<v Speaker 2>you know where I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like someone's watching watching </v>

1193
00:53:28.241 --> 00:53:29.074
<v Speaker 2>this or the way you react or your </v>
<v Speaker 2>listening or what you're here and just </v>

1194
00:53:31.741 --> 00:53:35.550
<v Speaker 2>all your senses become so fine tuned to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the wilderness.</v>

1195
00:53:36.340 --> 00:53:37.860
<v Speaker 2>A man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a beautiful thing.</v>

1196
00:53:38.190 --> 00:53:39.023
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The move forward is an interesting way </v>

1197
00:53:39.931 --> 00:53:43.470
<v Speaker 2>of looking at it because I don't think </v>
<v Speaker 2>technology necessarily is having us move</v>

1198
00:53:43.471 --> 00:53:46.020
<v Speaker 2>forward,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what it's definitely having us do is</v>

1199
00:53:46.380 --> 00:53:48.030
<v Speaker 2>move different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're,</v>

1200
00:53:48.031 --> 00:53:48.720
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

1201
00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:49.553
<v Speaker 2>we're interacting with each other less </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the physical sense and more in the </v>

1202
00:53:52.921 --> 00:53:53.754
<v Speaker 2>digital sense and we're way less likely </v>
<v Speaker 2>to interact with the rest of the wild </v>

1203
00:53:58.231 --> 00:54:00.660
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where in the world the wild.</v>

1204
00:54:00.720 --> 00:54:04.260
<v Speaker 2>That's a weird term to like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've always felt like the word outdoors,</v>

1205
00:54:04.320 --> 00:54:08.010
<v Speaker 2>like I love the outdoors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like how fucking weird or people that we</v>

1206
00:54:08.011 --> 00:54:10.640
<v Speaker 2>call the whole world outdoors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I like,</v>

1207
00:54:10.940 --> 00:54:15.240
<v Speaker 2>we're so used to being in these shelters</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the sheltered life is normal,</v>

1208
00:54:15.480 --> 00:54:18.440
<v Speaker 2>but the outdoors out of the shelter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's the actual word.</v>

1209
00:54:18.450 --> 00:54:19.590
<v Speaker 2>That's actual world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1210
00:54:19.690 --> 00:54:21.090
<v Speaker 2>That's you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

1211
00:54:21.400 --> 00:54:23.730
<v Speaker 2>You go to the door to go out there </v>
<v Speaker 2>camping.</v>

1212
00:54:23.880 --> 00:54:25.050
<v Speaker 2>You go to the outdoor?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1213
00:54:25.180 --> 00:54:26.910
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well the outdoors.</v>

1214
00:54:26.911 --> 00:54:28.650
<v Speaker 2>Like what a weird description.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1215
00:54:28.680 --> 00:54:30.210
<v Speaker 2>Outdoors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1216
00:54:30.211 --> 00:54:32.790
<v Speaker 2>it's a strange way of looking at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>wilderness.</v>

1217
00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:36.060
<v Speaker 2>The wilderness is a much better term,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but outdoors is like,</v>

1218
00:54:36.061 --> 00:54:37.440
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love the great outdoors.</v>

1219
00:54:37.640 --> 00:54:40.320
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love the world.</v>

1220
00:54:40.321 --> 00:54:41.154
<v Speaker 2>How it is today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he said it on a shy not long </v>

1221
00:54:43.171 --> 00:54:44.004
<v Speaker 2>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We had never had it better than we have </v>

1222
00:54:45.481 --> 00:54:46.830
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One hundred percent.</v>

1223
00:54:46.860 --> 00:54:49.200
<v Speaker 2>If you don't think we've got a better </v>
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>

1224
00:54:49.350 --> 00:54:50.183
<v Speaker 2>it's because you're not looking at and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not appreciating everything that </v>

1225
00:54:52.290 --> 00:54:54.750
<v Speaker 2>there is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I like technology in the sense that I</v>

1226
00:54:54.751 --> 00:54:58.140
<v Speaker 2>can connect with a lot of people you </v>
<v Speaker 2>campaigns and stuff like that.</v>

1227
00:54:58.141 --> 00:55:02.070
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't have friendships with you </v>
<v Speaker 2>guys if it wasn't for how technology was</v>

1228
00:55:02.071 --> 00:55:03.600
<v Speaker 2>to die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You live on the other side of that.</v>

1229
00:55:03.830 --> 00:55:05.310
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How crazy is that?</v>

1230
00:55:05.990 --> 00:55:09.360
<v Speaker 2>And the world becomes really small,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I love all that,</v>

1231
00:55:09.420 --> 00:55:10.253
<v Speaker 2>but at the scientologist height,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the disconnect that pay will have a </v>

1232
00:55:13.111 --> 00:55:17.220
<v Speaker 2>height that everyone's so busy trying to</v>
<v Speaker 2>work for a living and have a nice car or</v>

1233
00:55:17.221 --> 00:55:18.054
<v Speaker 2>a big house or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and in the end that shit's not even </v>

1234
00:55:20.311 --> 00:55:21.840
<v Speaker 2>important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't even matter.</v>

1235
00:55:22.230 --> 00:55:23.063
<v Speaker 2>It's not like it's not the memory that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to get from going out to </v>

1236
00:55:25.501 --> 00:55:27.900
<v Speaker 2>the wilderness or the connection or the </v>
<v Speaker 2>appreciation.</v>

1237
00:55:27.990 --> 00:55:31.590
<v Speaker 2>I appreciate me because I've had to kill</v>
<v Speaker 2>myself.</v>

1238
00:55:32.160 --> 00:55:36.210
<v Speaker 2>I appreciate power because of going </v>
<v Speaker 2>without power for weeks.</v>

1239
00:55:36.240 --> 00:55:38.350
<v Speaker 2>I appreciate hot water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You appreciate all those things.</v>

1240
00:55:38.351 --> 00:55:40.020
<v Speaker 2>Like a car,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a paved road,</v>

1241
00:55:40.680 --> 00:55:43.630
<v Speaker 2>rubbish service.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone comes to your house and collects</v>

1242
00:55:43.631 --> 00:55:45.570
<v Speaker 2>you frigging rubbish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Serious.</v>

1243
00:55:46.250 --> 00:55:48.030
<v Speaker 2>Not Serious about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1244
00:55:48.140 --> 00:55:52.200
<v Speaker 2>There was a point where we couldn't get </v>
<v Speaker 2>done what we would today because you had</v>

1245
00:55:52.201 --> 00:55:53.990
<v Speaker 2>so much else to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1246
00:55:54.060 --> 00:55:54.893
<v Speaker 2>You're on rubbish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably grow your own vegetables or </v>

1247
00:55:56.940 --> 00:56:01.620
<v Speaker 2>drive or walk or horse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ride the dye into town to get vegetables</v>

1248
00:56:01.860 --> 00:56:05.580
<v Speaker 2>or whatever it was and washing your </v>
<v Speaker 2>clothes.</v>

1249
00:56:05.581 --> 00:56:08.650
<v Speaker 2>We didn't sit in there for scrubbing </v>
<v Speaker 2>brush and Washington.</v>

1250
00:56:08.651 --> 00:56:10.310
<v Speaker 2>You close over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bode would take hours and hours.</v>

1251
00:56:10.320 --> 00:56:11.153
<v Speaker 2>Now you just throw it into a machine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll come back and get it when it's </v>

1252
00:56:13.081 --> 00:56:17.670
<v Speaker 2>convenient for me and pull it out so you</v>
<v Speaker 2>get to do a lot more in today's world,</v>

1253
00:56:18.300 --> 00:56:21.510
<v Speaker 2>but it also.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's so much to do that it's a lot of</v>

1254
00:56:21.511 --> 00:56:25.270
<v Speaker 2>people don't get to do what we do and go</v>
<v Speaker 2>outdoors and experience at or appreciate</v>

1255
00:56:25.271 --> 00:56:27.310
<v Speaker 2>those things because they haven't had </v>
<v Speaker 2>that hardship.</v>

1256
00:56:27.850 --> 00:56:28.683
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the mountains is a hard can be a hard </v>

1257
00:56:30.621 --> 00:56:31.454
<v Speaker 2>and miserable experience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it makes you appreciate the things </v>

1258
00:56:35.080 --> 00:56:36.370
<v Speaker 2>in modern life</v>

1259
00:56:36.460 --> 00:56:39.910
<v Speaker 1>that are hard anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a prospective enhancer because it's</v>

1260
00:56:39.911 --> 00:56:41.890
<v Speaker 1>a reality check because you realize,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

1261
00:56:42.160 --> 00:56:42.993
<v Speaker 1>what a strange world we live in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we need shelter and we fire and we </v>

1262
00:56:47.291 --> 00:56:50.530
<v Speaker 1>need all this stuff in order to survive </v>
<v Speaker 1>without that stuff.</v>

1263
00:56:50.770 --> 00:56:53.680
<v Speaker 1>When you're out there like as as </v>
<v Speaker 1>minimalistic as you've done it,</v>

1264
00:56:53.710 --> 00:56:54.543
<v Speaker 1>like doing it with a small pack,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which few days where the food and </v>

1265
00:56:57.670 --> 00:57:00.520
<v Speaker 1>sleeping under a cloth house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little tent,</v>

1266
00:57:00.521 --> 00:57:01.354
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's a perspective enhanced </v>

1267
00:57:03.110 --> 00:57:03.943
<v Speaker 1>because it gives you this real </v>
<v Speaker 1>appreciation of what people have </v>

1268
00:57:06.341 --> 00:57:10.750
<v Speaker 1>actually accomplished,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but most folks are not doing that and so</v>

1269
00:57:10.751 --> 00:57:13.750
<v Speaker 1>they get really detached from where </v>
<v Speaker 1>their food comes from.</v>

1270
00:57:13.751 --> 00:57:17.680
<v Speaker 1>Really detached from the world itself </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's not,</v>

1271
00:57:17.890 --> 00:57:18.723
<v Speaker 1>it's not their fault.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just the environment that you're </v>

1272
00:57:20.411 --> 00:57:23.080
<v Speaker 1>accustomed to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're all accustomed to supermarkets and</v>

1273
00:57:23.081 --> 00:57:26.200
<v Speaker 1>restaurants and being able to just get a</v>
<v Speaker 1>bottle of water.</v>

1274
00:57:27.100 --> 00:57:28.900
<v Speaker 1>I'm thirsty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me just pop the top on.</v>

1275
00:57:28.901 --> 00:57:31.300
<v Speaker 1>This table is still complaining about </v>
<v Speaker 1>that Shit.</v>

1276
00:57:31.780 --> 00:57:32.740
<v Speaker 1>That's the crazy thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I</v>

1277
00:57:32.740 --> 00:57:34.650
<v Speaker 2>think people will still complain about </v>
<v Speaker 2>that and I'm like,</v>

1278
00:57:34.651 --> 00:57:36.420
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need to check yourself.</v>

1279
00:57:37.290 --> 00:57:39.440
<v Speaker 2>Went to Africa a couple of years ago and</v>
<v Speaker 2>was lucky enough,</v>

1280
00:57:39.470 --> 00:57:40.303
<v Speaker 2>real poor village and in Mozambique and </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone's still smiling like it was an </v>

1281
00:57:46.500 --> 00:57:48.900
<v Speaker 2>unseasonal year and it was really cold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1282
00:57:49.470 --> 00:57:52.560
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what we go for this village and a lot of</v>

1283
00:57:52.561 --> 00:57:54.300
<v Speaker 2>these villages,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've never seen what person before,</v>

1284
00:57:54.301 --> 00:57:55.134
<v Speaker 2>and we go for these villages and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>free o'clock in the morning and they're </v>

1285
00:57:57.961 --> 00:58:02.961
<v Speaker 2>all standing around the fire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I said to the guy beside me,</v>

1286
00:58:03.390 --> 00:58:04.950
<v Speaker 2>the local guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1287
00:58:04.951 --> 00:58:06.360
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did they all start work early?</v>

1288
00:58:06.480 --> 00:58:07.410
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nah,</v>

1289
00:58:08.020 --> 00:58:08.910
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can't sleep.</v>

1290
00:58:09.480 --> 00:58:10.800
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you mean they can't sleep?</v>

1291
00:58:10.801 --> 00:58:11.520
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1292
00:58:11.520 --> 00:58:12.353
<v Speaker 2>it's really cold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have blankets or anything like </v>

1293
00:58:13.831 --> 00:58:15.450
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they get up in the morning,</v>

1294
00:58:15.451 --> 00:58:18.630
<v Speaker 2>they started far and they all huddle </v>
<v Speaker 2>around the fire to get warm because it's</v>

1295
00:58:18.631 --> 00:58:19.464
<v Speaker 2>freezing.</v>

1296
00:58:20.280 --> 00:58:24.390
<v Speaker 2>And it's not that they don't have the </v>
<v Speaker 2>money to buy blankets.</v>

1297
00:58:24.500 --> 00:58:27.030
<v Speaker 2>There's no blankets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no frigging blankets for sale.</v>

1298
00:58:27.210 --> 00:58:28.740
<v Speaker 2>It's as simple as that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's not like,</v>

1299
00:58:28.800 --> 00:58:29.633
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't have the $20 to buy a </v>

1300
00:58:30.961 --> 00:58:33.580
<v Speaker 2>blanket.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is not even the resource for there</v>

1301
00:58:33.590 --> 00:58:35.790
<v Speaker 2>to be a blanket available for in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Bot.</v>

1302
00:58:36.060 --> 00:58:38.550
<v Speaker 2>There's babies crawling around in dust </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's like six,</v>

1303
00:58:38.551 --> 00:58:39.300
<v Speaker 2>seven,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eight,</v>

1304
00:58:39.300 --> 00:58:40.133
<v Speaker 2>eight inches thick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The dust around the village because you </v>

1305
00:58:42.441 --> 00:58:43.180
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the,</v>

1306
00:58:43.180 --> 00:58:45.060
<v Speaker 2>they'll walk around the village and </v>
<v Speaker 2>created a lot of dust.</v>

1307
00:58:45.810 --> 00:58:48.150
<v Speaker 2>No one's complained in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what they used to.</v>

1308
00:58:48.151 --> 00:58:53.070
<v Speaker 2>And they're happy frog fro someone from </v>
<v Speaker 2>our society in that man,</v>

1309
00:58:53.071 --> 00:58:53.904
<v Speaker 2>they'd be miserable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They probably cut their own freaking </v>

1310
00:58:55.231 --> 00:58:56.790
<v Speaker 2>risks and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1311
00:58:57.000 --> 00:58:57.833
<v Speaker 2>and all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1312
00:58:58.080 --> 00:59:00.990
<v Speaker 2>I come home from their thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those people have got it that hard.</v>

1313
00:59:01.170 --> 00:59:02.003
<v Speaker 2>It's what they used to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they've got that hard and they're </v>

1314
00:59:04.051 --> 00:59:05.770
<v Speaker 2>still smiling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

1315
00:59:05.771 --> 00:59:08.460
<v Speaker 2>And it was a bit of a check for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got power,</v>

1316
00:59:08.730 --> 00:59:09.563
<v Speaker 2>I've got running water and I've always </v>
<v Speaker 2>been appreciative of these things </v>

1317
00:59:11.371 --> 00:59:13.250
<v Speaker 2>anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

1318
00:59:14.190 --> 00:59:15.720
<v Speaker 2>we've got power,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've got water,</v>

1319
00:59:16.020 --> 00:59:18.150
<v Speaker 2>we've got in Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've got Medicare,</v>

1320
00:59:18.151 --> 00:59:19.770
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like real good health services.</v>

1321
00:59:19.771 --> 00:59:22.040
<v Speaker 2>We've got everything like that and </v>
<v Speaker 2>people still find</v>

1322
00:59:22.040 --> 00:59:22.873
<v Speaker 3>something to complain about and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>just because I haven't been through a </v>

1323
00:59:25.281 --> 00:59:26.114
<v Speaker 3>real hardship in their life that they </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't realize it could be a hell of a </v>

1324
00:59:29.001 --> 00:59:30.680
<v Speaker 3>lot harder than this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This isn't even hard.</v>

1325
00:59:30.681 --> 00:59:32.600
<v Speaker 3>It's easy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just what we're used to and we used</v>

1326
00:59:32.601 --> 00:59:34.040
<v Speaker 3>to complain in the Baylor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1327
00:59:34.041 --> 00:59:39.041
<v Speaker 3>it's also one of the strange things that</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've created by co creating houses that</v>

1328
00:59:39.171 --> 00:59:44.171
<v Speaker 3>have electricity inside them and easy </v>
<v Speaker 3>access to food and shelter with sleep,</v>

1329
00:59:45.061 --> 00:59:47.350
<v Speaker 3>but a nice comfortable mattress.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

1330
00:59:47.420 --> 00:59:50.690
<v Speaker 3>By doing that and by detaching ourselves</v>
<v Speaker 3>from the natural world,</v>

1331
00:59:50.691 --> 00:59:55.520
<v Speaker 3>I think we remove just a little bit of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the mystery of being alive.</v>

1332
00:59:55.550 --> 01:00:00.140
<v Speaker 3>How bizarre it really is to be a living </v>
<v Speaker 3>creature and amazing.</v>

1333
01:00:00.141 --> 01:00:01.610
<v Speaker 3>It is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1334
01:00:01.850 --> 01:00:02.690
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're.</v>

1335
01:00:02.720 --> 01:00:03.553
<v Speaker 3>When you were walking through the woods </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you're seeing that grizzly bear who </v>

1336
01:00:05.930 --> 01:00:06.763
<v Speaker 3>sleeping on the carcass of the elk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that bear has been living like that </v>

1337
01:00:10.820 --> 01:00:13.340
<v Speaker 3>probably for if you've ran into an 11 </v>
<v Speaker 3>foot bear,</v>

1338
01:00:13.500 --> 01:00:15.810
<v Speaker 3>how many years is he like 15 years old </v>
<v Speaker 3>and being.</v>

1339
01:00:15.830 --> 01:00:19.670
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a giant fucking huge monster bear.</v>

1340
01:00:20.020 --> 01:00:25.020
<v Speaker 3>That's just out there surviving the hard</v>
<v Speaker 3>way for a long time in Montana.</v>

1341
01:00:25.850 --> 01:00:28.770
<v Speaker 3>Going through these winters doesn't give</v>
<v Speaker 3>a shit if it rains.</v>

1342
01:00:29.090 --> 01:00:31.010
<v Speaker 3>If it's sunny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if it's snowing,</v>

1343
01:00:31.100 --> 01:00:33.020
<v Speaker 3>doesn't give a shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't even give a shit about a pack</v>

1344
01:00:33.021 --> 01:00:35.120
<v Speaker 3>of wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Black doll eyes.</v>

1345
01:00:35.121 --> 01:00:35.954
<v Speaker 3>You see their eyes when you look.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I ran into one grizzly bear in my life </v>

1346
01:00:39.621 --> 01:00:44.110
<v Speaker 3>where it was in the wild only once and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it was last year with Cam and Alberta.</v>

1347
01:00:44.111 --> 01:00:44.944
<v Speaker 3>I was actually with Jen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jen and Jen said turnarounds at grizzly </v>

1348
01:00:49.791 --> 01:00:50.624
<v Speaker 3>and we turned around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is grizzly looking at us and this </v>

1349
01:00:52.671 --> 01:00:55.300
<v Speaker 3>motherfucker was looking through me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1350
01:00:55.640 --> 01:00:58.790
<v Speaker 3>there's such a difference in the way </v>
<v Speaker 3>they look at you and he's not looking at</v>

1351
01:00:58.810 --> 01:01:00.100
<v Speaker 3>it and going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll try Rogan.</v>

1352
01:01:01.110 --> 01:01:02.270
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they look through.</v>

1353
01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:06.950
<v Speaker 3>Look through you and the Strangeness </v>
<v Speaker 3>Apex Predator Way.</v>

1354
01:01:07.310 --> 01:01:08.143
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have like this dead look in their </v>

1355
01:01:08.871 --> 01:01:09.770
<v Speaker 3>eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very.</v>

1356
01:01:09.830 --> 01:01:11.350
<v Speaker 3>It's a very strange,</v>
<v Speaker 3>endless.</v>

1357
01:01:11.510 --> 01:01:12.291
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is.</v>

1358
01:01:12.291 --> 01:01:13.124
<v Speaker 3>It's like A.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I shouldn't say Saul was probably so </v>

1359
01:01:15.510 --> 01:01:16.490
<v Speaker 3>harsh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>harsh way,</v>

1360
01:01:16.510 --> 01:01:18.590
<v Speaker 3>but I don't even know if a soul is real,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that what you're saying.</v>

1361
01:01:18.591 --> 01:01:20.210
<v Speaker 3>Exactly that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't give a shit.</v>

1362
01:01:21.260 --> 01:01:23.030
<v Speaker 3>They don't give a shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what it is.</v>

1363
01:01:23.060 --> 01:01:24.920
<v Speaker 3>Compassionate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is just a part of life.</v>

1364
01:01:25.220 --> 01:01:26.910
<v Speaker 3>If I feel like I'm gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going figure it out.</v>

1365
01:01:26.911 --> 01:01:27.744
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember the first video I ever saw a </v>

1366
01:01:29.721 --> 01:01:33.020
<v Speaker 3>bear killed a moose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The bear chased the Moose,</v>

1367
01:01:33.050 --> 01:01:37.130
<v Speaker 3>knocked it down and started eating it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Guts first while it was alive.</v>

1368
01:01:37.220 --> 01:01:39.260
<v Speaker 3>Just holding it down and eating it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's nice.</v>

1369
01:01:39.490 --> 01:01:41.600
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is it.</v>

1370
01:01:41.720 --> 01:01:42.553
<v Speaker 3>This is the funny bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know where these extreme greenies </v>

1371
01:01:45.001 --> 01:01:47.810
<v Speaker 3>think these animals go around hugging </v>
<v Speaker 3>each other.</v>

1372
01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:48.321
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1373
01:01:48.321 --> 01:01:49.154
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's my cousin and I will have cut to </v>

1374
01:01:50.750 --> 01:01:52.820
<v Speaker 3>catch up and have it be lighter and shit</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>

1375
01:01:52.860 --> 01:01:53.810
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't give a fuck.</v>

1376
01:01:53.820 --> 01:01:56.950
<v Speaker 3>They don't care if you're screaming and </v>
<v Speaker 3>hal and it's just going to eat you.</v>

1377
01:01:56.970 --> 01:02:01.550
<v Speaker 3>It's like the [inaudible] a dingoes back</v>
<v Speaker 3>home if thing.</v>

1378
01:02:01.560 --> 01:02:03.500
<v Speaker 3>Guys get a cough back home.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't lock all.</v>

1379
01:02:03.610 --> 01:02:06.560
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to be humane with this cough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll,</v>

1380
01:02:06.561 --> 01:02:08.090
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll bought it first.</v>

1381
01:02:08.091 --> 01:02:09.890
<v Speaker 3>I'll tear it out and make sure it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>died.</v>

1382
01:02:09.891 --> 01:02:13.520
<v Speaker 3>And it's peaceful and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'll just start eating it right there</v>

1383
01:02:13.521 --> 01:02:14.354
<v Speaker 3>and then it will die in its own time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know that that's not even a full </v>

1384
01:02:17.101 --> 01:02:18.920
<v Speaker 3>process for these animals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1385
01:02:18.921 --> 01:02:21.540
<v Speaker 3>They're just concerned with consumption.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you,</v>

1386
01:02:21.570 --> 01:02:25.230
<v Speaker 3>when you do see them do it too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you do see them eat something,</v>

1387
01:02:25.231 --> 01:02:27.150
<v Speaker 3>it's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah,</v>

1388
01:02:27.151 --> 01:02:28.050
<v Speaker 3>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how they do.</v>

1389
01:02:28.080 --> 01:02:29.160
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1390
01:02:29.161 --> 01:02:30.840
<v Speaker 3>but you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't think of it that way.</v>

1391
01:02:31.140 --> 01:02:32.040
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's movies,</v>

1392
01:02:32.100 --> 01:02:32.933
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Movies have confused the shit out of </v>

1393
01:02:34.351 --> 01:02:37.800
<v Speaker 3>people and then being away from them for</v>
<v Speaker 3>long periods of time.</v>

1394
01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:38.753
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But we can't blame the movies because </v>

1395
01:02:40.021 --> 01:02:42.450
<v Speaker 3>it's on that individual.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm smart enough.</v>

1396
01:02:42.510 --> 01:02:43.343
<v Speaker 3>You're smart enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Common Sense tells you that that's a </v>

1397
01:02:45.631 --> 01:02:48.240
<v Speaker 3>movie they're not really like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

1398
01:02:48.241 --> 01:02:49.074
<v Speaker 3>How can people be that disconnected to </v>
<v Speaker 3>think that's actually how animals live </v>

1399
01:02:52.351 --> 01:02:54.900
<v Speaker 3>that life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just a frigging movie.</v>

1400
01:02:55.350 --> 01:02:58.290
<v Speaker 3>People that just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think they really think that,</v>

1401
01:02:58.320 --> 01:03:00.960
<v Speaker 3>but they're not exposed to the harsh </v>
<v Speaker 3>reality of it.</v>

1402
01:03:00.990 --> 01:03:03.360
<v Speaker 3>Like they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think they really think that the</v>

1403
01:03:03.361 --> 01:03:04.194
<v Speaker 3>bears talk to each other and English and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then they hug each other and they help </v>

1404
01:03:07.081 --> 01:03:07.980
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

1405
01:03:08.130 --> 01:03:08.963
<v Speaker 3>but the reality of seeing bears in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Klondike bar commercials and Coca Cola </v>

1406
01:03:12.751 --> 01:03:14.760
<v Speaker 3>ads,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that does fuck with your head,</v>

1407
01:03:15.060 --> 01:03:20.060
<v Speaker 3>it does plants the seeds of what a </v>
<v Speaker 3>rinella calls.</v>

1408
01:03:20.611 --> 01:03:21.510
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what does it call it?</v>

1409
01:03:21.540 --> 01:03:25.080
<v Speaker 3>A charismatic megafauna.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These things become,</v>

1410
01:03:25.081 --> 01:03:26.240
<v Speaker 3>they become your friends,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>

1411
01:03:26.241 --> 01:03:28.850
<v Speaker 3>your long lost wilderness friends that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

1412
01:03:28.860 --> 01:03:30.690
<v Speaker 3>I'll get a cat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll get a dog at home.</v>

1413
01:03:31.170 --> 01:03:32.060
<v Speaker 3>I love them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1414
01:03:32.070 --> 01:03:33.310
<v Speaker 3>cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But at the end of the day,</v>

1415
01:03:33.370 --> 01:03:35.940
<v Speaker 3>now it's an animal and it's not a </v>
<v Speaker 3>senseless senseless.</v>

1416
01:03:35.941 --> 01:03:36.774
<v Speaker 3>Why assign it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I believe hunters or hunters </v>

1417
01:03:39.691 --> 01:03:40.524
<v Speaker 3>that augment the most compassionate </v>
<v Speaker 3>people that you'll ever meet because if </v>

1418
01:03:43.860 --> 01:03:45.690
<v Speaker 3>it is a hard thing to take an animal's </v>
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>

1419
01:03:45.691 --> 01:03:48.240
<v Speaker 3>But I know it's part of the process,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

1420
01:03:48.330 --> 01:03:50.680
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not like I'm just thought,</v>

1421
01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:53.050
<v Speaker 3>let's just go and kill an elk got </v>
<v Speaker 3>killed.</v>

1422
01:03:53.130 --> 01:03:57.150
<v Speaker 3>I'm totally not that hunter at all life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nothing turns me off more.</v>

1423
01:03:57.180 --> 01:03:59.970
<v Speaker 3>I'm not that sort of person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll have a quiet time with that.</v>

1424
01:04:00.170 --> 01:04:01.290
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the animal.</v>

1425
01:04:01.291 --> 01:04:04.740
<v Speaker 3>I'll put my hand on it and everything </v>
<v Speaker 3>and just be thankful.</v>

1426
01:04:05.210 --> 01:04:08.250
<v Speaker 3>I know it's an animal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know the meat's going to be used.</v>

1427
01:04:08.590 --> 01:04:11.880
<v Speaker 3>I know I'm doing the right thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's still.</v>

1428
01:04:11.970 --> 01:04:13.890
<v Speaker 3>That's the human emotion part of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1429
01:04:13.891 --> 01:04:15.300
<v Speaker 3>and that's what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a sense,</v>

1430
01:04:15.301 --> 01:04:17.640
<v Speaker 3>that's why I got upset when I killed </v>
<v Speaker 3>that bull elk.</v>

1431
01:04:17.640 --> 01:04:18.400
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

1432
01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:20.100
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is a beautiful creature.</v>

1433
01:04:20.190 --> 01:04:21.023
<v Speaker 3>I understand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's definitely a beautiful creature </v>

1434
01:04:22.381 --> 01:04:26.160
<v Speaker 3>and it's a hard thing to do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's the food chain.</v>

1435
01:04:26.490 --> 01:04:28.230
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's also very sustainable.</v>

1436
01:04:28.231 --> 01:04:31.350
<v Speaker 3>And what's interesting is what you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing is you're dipping your,</v>

1437
01:04:31.620 --> 01:04:33.450
<v Speaker 3>your body,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your mind,</v>

1438
01:04:33.451 --> 01:04:34.284
<v Speaker 3>your feet into the wild world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That elk is going to get eaten by </v>

1439
01:04:36.841 --> 01:04:37.674
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1440
01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:38.513
<v Speaker 3>If it's not you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's going to get eaten by that bear </v>

1441
01:04:39.631 --> 01:04:42.410
<v Speaker 3>that was sleeping on the carcass or </v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing goes to waste of.</v>

1442
01:04:42.920 --> 01:04:45.210
<v Speaker 3>I completely understand that after </v>
<v Speaker 3>hunting,</v>

1443
01:04:45.680 --> 01:04:46.513
<v Speaker 3>after getting so far in the hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I completely understand that nothing </v>

1444
01:04:48.691 --> 01:04:50.010
<v Speaker 3>goes to waste.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nothing ever.</v>

1445
01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:50.993
<v Speaker 3>If an animal breaks his leg,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's something's going to take care of </v>

1446
01:04:53.101 --> 01:04:53.860
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

1447
01:04:53.860 --> 01:04:54.481
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1448
01:04:54.481 --> 01:04:55.314
<v Speaker 3>It's just all part of the cycle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all part of the big picture of the </v>

1449
01:04:57.151 --> 01:04:58.410
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The biggest,</v>

1450
01:04:58.460 --> 01:05:02.020
<v Speaker 3>the biggest creature on the world is the</v>
<v Speaker 3>world itself.</v>

1451
01:05:02.021 --> 01:05:07.021
<v Speaker 3>If phase off everything us the way or </v>
<v Speaker 3>even part part of the world's Pri.</v>

1452
01:05:07.960 --> 01:05:09.090
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and in a way,</v>

1453
01:05:09.091 --> 01:05:09.924
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>definitely becomes this super complex </v>

1454
01:05:11.941 --> 01:05:15.930
<v Speaker 3>system that has everything in place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's got a system to dissolve bodies and</v>

1455
01:05:16.320 --> 01:05:18.370
<v Speaker 3>the bacteria dissolves what the animals</v>

1456
01:05:18.370 --> 01:05:19.203
<v Speaker 2>don't eat and there's just this really </v>
<v Speaker 2>complex pattern that's in place that's </v>

1457
01:05:23.591 --> 01:05:24.424
<v Speaker 2>been in place forever and what you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing as a hunter is is going into it </v>

1458
01:05:28.061 --> 01:05:32.800
<v Speaker 2>and becoming for a brief week or so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're becoming a part of that system or</v>

1459
01:05:32.840 --> 01:05:33.673
<v Speaker 2>that's how you acquire your or a month </v>
<v Speaker 2>for you and you're acquiring your food </v>

1460
01:05:37.241 --> 01:05:38.074
<v Speaker 2>that way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I obviously and you obviously </v>

1461
01:05:40.481 --> 01:05:41.314
<v Speaker 2>think is way better than going to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking monster and hiring some </v>

1462
01:05:44.321 --> 01:05:48.160
<v Speaker 2>supermarket hitman to do the work for </v>
<v Speaker 2>you and feeling that your guilt free.</v>

1463
01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:51.010
<v Speaker 2>I worked at Abbott was for some time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is that?</v>

1464
01:05:51.360 --> 01:05:53.400
<v Speaker 2>A abetour is like a slaughterhouse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1465
01:05:53.860 --> 01:05:56.830
<v Speaker 2>Aba in Australia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You ever heard of that?</v>

1466
01:05:57.320 --> 01:06:01.210
<v Speaker 2>I think it's might be an Australia is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>very secluded here in America.</v>

1467
01:06:01.220 --> 01:06:03.490
<v Speaker 2>Will have just know that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1468
01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:04.833
<v Speaker 2>we wouldn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't know too much about you other </v>

1469
01:06:06.071 --> 01:06:08.670
<v Speaker 2>than like Crocodile Dundee,</v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy.</v>

1470
01:06:08.930 --> 01:06:09.763
<v Speaker 2>A land down under.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes I'll use a signing or say </v>

1471
01:06:11.711 --> 01:06:13.570
<v Speaker 2>something unlucky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You understand that word or not?</v>

1472
01:06:13.960 --> 01:06:17.970
<v Speaker 2>How about tool waterhouse?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So is that normal?</v>

1473
01:06:18.520 --> 01:06:19.540
<v Speaker 2>Spanish,</v>
<v Speaker 2>central,</v>

1474
01:06:20.320 --> 01:06:21.310
<v Speaker 2>Spanish,</v>
<v Speaker 2>central.</v>

1475
01:06:21.480 --> 01:06:23.770
<v Speaker 2>Stria bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Spanish speakers.</v>

1476
01:06:23.890 --> 01:06:25.720
<v Speaker 2>Is it a Spanish word?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Must Be.</v>

1477
01:06:25.930 --> 01:06:27.520
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Interesting word.</v>

1478
01:06:27.640 --> 01:06:32.380
<v Speaker 2>I'll just start cooling the </v>
<v Speaker 2>slaughterhouse and so 7,000</v>

1479
01:06:32.381 --> 01:06:37.080
<v Speaker 2>shape would go past on a chain and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>just had the one job to do and and,</v>

1480
01:06:37.330 --> 01:06:40.080
<v Speaker 2>and they'd be 700 people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're making a slash,</v>

1481
01:06:40.400 --> 01:06:41.330
<v Speaker 2>is that what you did?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1482
01:06:41.340 --> 01:06:42.173
<v Speaker 2>just cut their throats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would be 700 other workers just on </v>

1483
01:06:46.001 --> 01:06:46.834
<v Speaker 2>the slaughter floor pot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that meet with passing 700 people's </v>

1484
01:06:50.681 --> 01:06:54.640
<v Speaker 2>hands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Males the whole lot for A.</v>

1485
01:06:54.640 --> 01:06:55.473
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying there's nothing wrong </v>
<v Speaker 2>with this because the population of the </v>

1486
01:06:57.131 --> 01:06:59.470
<v Speaker 2>world demands that not everyone can hunt</v>
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>

1487
01:06:59.471 --> 01:07:01.900
<v Speaker 2>so I don't have an issue with slaughter </v>
<v Speaker 2>houses or anything like that,</v>

1488
01:07:01.901 --> 01:07:06.220
<v Speaker 2>but I'm saying that might goes through a</v>
<v Speaker 2>wide different process.</v>

1489
01:07:06.760 --> 01:07:07.593
<v Speaker 2>I'd have to say for a better word.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brutal process where those animals get </v>

1490
01:07:14.111 --> 01:07:16.320
<v Speaker 2>hurt on to a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1491
01:07:16.460 --> 01:07:17.980
<v Speaker 2>like a truck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a semi trailer,</v>

1492
01:07:18.690 --> 01:07:19.523
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>driven to the lord has putting small </v>

1493
01:07:20.591 --> 01:07:25.080
<v Speaker 2>yards pushed through a gate to go past </v>
<v Speaker 2>all those people's hands that,</v>

1494
01:07:25.081 --> 01:07:25.570
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that uh,</v>

1495
01:07:25.570 --> 01:07:26.403
<v Speaker 2>cutting the meat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's before it even gets to the point </v>

1496
01:07:28.211 --> 01:07:29.950
<v Speaker 2>where it's going to get cut off for </v>
<v Speaker 2>packaging.</v>

1497
01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:31.833
<v Speaker 2>And then obviously it gets sent out to </v>
<v Speaker 2>different grocery stores and then sold </v>

1498
01:07:35.441 --> 01:07:37.900
<v Speaker 2>from there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My mate passes these hands here.</v>

1499
01:07:37.930 --> 01:07:40.770
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the only made the deposit.</v>

1500
01:07:40.830 --> 01:07:41.663
<v Speaker 2>I'll get to inspect every single animal </v>
<v Speaker 2>in its natural form because on the one </v>

1501
01:07:45.221 --> 01:07:48.130
<v Speaker 2>that kills it isn't strange that that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>the norm.</v>

1502
01:07:48.200 --> 01:07:49.033
<v Speaker 2>The norm is a slaughterhouse and that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>only been around for a couple hundred </v>

1503
01:07:51.551 --> 01:07:53.860
<v Speaker 2>years for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody did it.</v>

1504
01:07:53.861 --> 01:07:55.000
<v Speaker 2>The hardware.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

1505
01:07:55.001 --> 01:07:56.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1506
01:07:56.260 --> 01:07:58.800
<v Speaker 2>But yet we seem to be.</v>

1507
01:07:58.810 --> 01:07:59.643
<v Speaker 2>The outside is for doing it like that </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's like this is so much more </v>

1508
01:08:02.321 --> 01:08:04.660
<v Speaker 2>natural.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is friggin beautiful.</v>

1509
01:08:04.840 --> 01:08:05.673
<v Speaker 2>That the process is actually beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once you get the knowledge and you look </v>

1510
01:08:08.051 --> 01:08:10.310
<v Speaker 2>at it that everyone thinks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1511
01:08:10.311 --> 01:08:11.144
<v Speaker 2>you had to get an animal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She didn't have clean of these together </v>

1512
01:08:12.900 --> 01:08:16.250
<v Speaker 2>an animal like it's clean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not a messy job at all.</v>

1513
01:08:16.630 --> 01:08:17.640
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1514
01:08:17.720 --> 01:08:20.330
<v Speaker 2>and there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I've got to block my nose.</v>

1515
01:08:20.331 --> 01:08:22.820
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to smell them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no smell,</v>

1516
01:08:22.880 --> 01:08:23.713
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is clean meat and that's what I'm </v>

1517
01:08:25.191 --> 01:08:26.024
<v Speaker 2>saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The blood on my hands at that point is </v>

1518
01:08:27.411 --> 01:08:28.244
<v Speaker 2>clean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wouldn't bother me to eat a chocolate </v>

1519
01:08:29.481 --> 01:08:30.790
<v Speaker 2>bar and lick my fingers after</v>

1520
01:08:31.060 --> 01:08:32.700
<v Speaker 1>you can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you can eat the meat completely.</v>

1521
01:08:32.830 --> 01:08:34.780
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ready to me a predator.</v>

1522
01:08:34.781 --> 01:08:35.614
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only thing you have to worry about </v>

1523
01:08:36.311 --> 01:08:39.430
<v Speaker 1>is if you eat a pig or if you eat a </v>
<v Speaker 1>mountain lion or something like that.</v>

1524
01:08:39.431 --> 01:08:41.830
<v Speaker 1>You gotta worry about trick analysis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't even have that at home.</v>

1525
01:08:41.890 --> 01:08:42.880
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to else?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>

1526
01:08:43.440 --> 01:08:45.840
<v Speaker 1>And so you can eat your piggery rare.</v>

1527
01:08:46.500 --> 01:08:47.530
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could,</v>

1528
01:08:47.590 --> 01:08:48.423
<v Speaker 2>you definitely could.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's so come here and they cook Bacon </v>

1529
01:08:51.221 --> 01:08:54.760
<v Speaker 2>and it's like crusty bit of cardboard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure you do the same.</v>

1530
01:08:55.210 --> 01:08:56.140
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know that.</v>

1531

<v Speaker 2>slightly cooked so I just slightly </v>

1534
01:09:07.181 --> 01:09:09.340
<v Speaker 2>cooked it and put it on the plate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had on my bacon,</v>

1535
01:09:09.341 --> 01:09:10.660

<v Speaker 2>And then after the fact that I've eaten </v>
<v Speaker 2>my bacon,</v>

<v Speaker 2>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you let me know.</v>

1542
01:09:24.190 --> 01:09:27.670
<v Speaker 1>Was it much less of a concern with </v>
<v Speaker 1>domestic pig?</v>

1543
01:09:28.210 --> 01:09:29.043
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They actually lowered the temperature </v>

1544
01:09:30.981 --> 01:09:34.610
<v Speaker 1>that you're supposed to kill a or cook </v>
<v Speaker 1>rather a domestic pork.</v>

1545
01:09:34.640 --> 01:09:37.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He used to be 165 degrees,</v>

1546
01:09:37.250 --> 01:09:38.570
<v Speaker 1>which is what they recommend you cook </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

1547
01:09:38.571 --> 01:09:41.160
<v Speaker 1>Bear at and now it's 140.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1548
01:09:41.280 --> 01:09:42.860
<v Speaker 1>So you're okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm okay.</v>

1549
01:09:42.861 --> 01:09:44.390
<v Speaker 1>I should be cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't want to ever get out.</v>

1550
01:09:44.860 --> 01:09:45.693
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless something gets to them the way </v>

1551
01:09:47.391 --> 01:09:49.920
<v Speaker 1>you get tricky gnosis by eating </v>
<v Speaker 1>something with trichinosis,</v>

1552
01:09:50.370 --> 01:09:53.870
<v Speaker 1>the horrific nature of pig farming of </v>
<v Speaker 1>domestic,</v>

1553
01:09:54.290 --> 01:09:56.480
<v Speaker 1>the way they raise it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these factory farms,</v>

1554
01:09:56.481 --> 01:09:57.620
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's horrible.</v>

1555
01:09:58.250 --> 01:09:59.083
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it really makes you never want to eat </v>

1556
01:09:59.661 --> 01:10:01.850
<v Speaker 1>pork again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's definitely really disgusting.</v>

1557
01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:02.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could.</v>

1558
01:10:02.760 --> 01:10:06.450
<v Speaker 2>I'm just happy fill in my freezer with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've naturally harvest mate.</v>

1559
01:10:06.800 --> 01:10:09.110
<v Speaker 2>One hundred percent key.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Make the kids eat it.</v>

1560
01:10:09.170 --> 01:10:09.740
<v Speaker 2>They all love it.</v>

1561
01:10:09.740 --> 01:10:10.573
<v Speaker 1>But isn't it interesting that what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>said earlier that everybody can't do </v>

1562
01:10:12.531 --> 01:10:13.364
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>

1563
01:10:13.630 --> 01:10:15.210
<v Speaker 2>Not do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's bizarre.</v>

1564
01:10:15.510 --> 01:10:16.343
<v Speaker 2>It is bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's because of what we're talking </v>

1565
01:10:17.441 --> 01:10:18.160
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone's,</v>

<v Speaker 2>of life.</v>

1569
01:10:25.420 --> 01:10:26.890
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that's the big push.</v>

1570
01:10:26.891 --> 01:10:28.300
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm always like,</v>

1571
01:10:28.301 --> 01:10:30.790
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you really need to be successful in this</v>

1572
01:10:30.791 --> 01:10:33.790
<v Speaker 2>type of life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the outdoors experience,</v>

1573

1576
01:10:40.871 --> 01:10:42.040
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who gives a shit?</v>

1577
01:10:42.041 --> 01:10:42.874
<v Speaker 2>Leave your job the more if you have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>go and do something that you enjoy in </v>

1578
01:10:45.551 --> 01:10:46.384
<v Speaker 2>life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

1579
01:10:46.960 --> 01:10:47.793
<v Speaker 2>that's the end story because you're not </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to get to your death bed and be </v>

1580
01:10:49.601 --> 01:10:50.141
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1581
01:10:50.141 --> 01:10:53.230
<v Speaker 2>I really wish I pushed and got that </v>
<v Speaker 2>better position at work or whatever.</v>

1582
01:10:53.530 --> 01:10:55.120
<v Speaker 2>You're never going to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'll.</v>

1583
01:10:55.180 --> 01:10:59.140
<v Speaker 2>You'll always be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wish I did more for my kids,</v>

1584
01:10:59.141 --> 01:11:01.960
<v Speaker 2>or I wish I went and climbed frigging </v>
<v Speaker 2>Everest or whatever it is.</v>

1585
01:11:01.990 --> 01:11:02.823
<v Speaker 2>That's what it's going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we don't get caught up in this trap </v>

1586
01:11:04.751 --> 01:11:08.650
<v Speaker 2>is now I've got to have the newest car,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the the nicest house.</v>

1587
01:11:08.651 --> 01:11:12.190
<v Speaker 2>We need to live in this suburb.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need to be the CEO at work.</v>

1588
01:11:12.191 --> 01:11:13.410
<v Speaker 2>I need to do that sort thing.</v>

1589
01:11:14.590 --> 01:11:17.290
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we're set up with this desire in</v>

1590
01:11:17.291 --> 01:11:20.500
<v Speaker 1>our heads to attain things that we think</v>
<v Speaker 1>are difficult to attain.</v>

1591
01:11:20.501 --> 01:11:21.334
<v Speaker 1>That we see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we see a shiny car and we see a </v>

1592
01:11:23.411 --> 01:11:25.780
<v Speaker 1>beautiful house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We see it all the,</v>

1593
01:11:25.781 --> 01:11:28.090
<v Speaker 1>all the different trappings of modern </v>
<v Speaker 1>society.</v>

1594
01:11:28.091 --> 01:11:28.924
<v Speaker 1>We see those things in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're very appealing to us and they </v>

1595
01:11:31.300 --> 01:11:36.300
<v Speaker 1>seem to be like goal posts of success </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then if we can reach those things,</v>

1596
01:11:36.761 --> 01:11:40.540
<v Speaker 1>maybe we'll we'll reach more happiness </v>
<v Speaker 1>or we'll feel better about ourselves.</v>

1597
01:11:40.840 --> 01:11:41.673
<v Speaker 1>We'll have some status that that we can </v>
<v Speaker 1>brag about and you chase that stuff </v>

1598
01:11:44.950 --> 01:11:45.960
<v Speaker 1>until your hearts out track.</v>

1599
01:11:46.080 --> 01:11:47.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do the same thing.</v>

1600
01:11:47.970 --> 01:11:49.230
<v Speaker 2>Don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't get me wrong.</v>

1601
01:11:49.231 --> 01:11:52.110
<v Speaker 2>I'll say advertisement for a car or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that and be like,</v>

1602
01:11:52.130 --> 01:11:52.963
<v Speaker 2>I really liked that car,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then it's another party minute </v>

1603
01:11:54.560 --> 01:11:56.790
<v Speaker 2>clinics and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't need that frigging car.</v>

1604
01:11:57.270 --> 01:11:59.910
<v Speaker 2>Why do you want that car?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That car means you got to work longer or</v>

1605
01:11:59.911 --> 01:12:03.030
<v Speaker 2>work more or something else to maintain </v>
<v Speaker 2>or something like that.</v>

1606
01:12:03.090 --> 01:12:05.580
<v Speaker 2>Or you want to go in and get that car </v>
<v Speaker 2>scratched in the bush.</v>

1607
01:12:06.180 --> 01:12:07.230
<v Speaker 2>That's another thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

1608
01:12:07.231 --> 01:12:07.741
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1609
01:12:07.741 --> 01:12:10.200
<v Speaker 2>I've already got a car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just be happy with what you've got.</v>

1610
01:12:10.201 --> 01:12:11.100
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're an idiot.</v>

1611
01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:12.930
<v Speaker 2>If you go and chase that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're an idiot.</v>

1612
01:12:12.931 --> 01:12:15.060
<v Speaker 2>Just be happy with what you've got.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Life's good.</v>

1613
01:12:15.630 --> 01:12:17.940
<v Speaker 2>More out time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more outdoor experience.</v>

1614
01:12:17.941 --> 01:12:19.950
<v Speaker 2>More time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If your kids more time for your wife,</v>

1615
01:12:20.220 --> 01:12:21.390
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In that sense,</v>

1616
01:12:21.391 --> 01:12:23.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>

1617
01:12:23.430 --> 01:12:27.180
<v Speaker 2>it's that said that that's the whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>modern society thing.</v>

1618
01:12:27.270 --> 01:12:31.620
<v Speaker 2>So indigenous Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not all of indigenous Australia,</v>

1619
01:12:31.740 --> 01:12:35.400
<v Speaker 2>most of indigenous Australia because </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so young to our culture,</v>

1620
01:12:35.580 --> 01:12:37.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because Australia was only discovered in</v>

1621
01:12:38.330 --> 01:12:40.740
<v Speaker 2>maybe jamie can look it up because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't know exact date,</v>

1622
01:12:40.741 --> 01:12:42.930
<v Speaker 2>I probably should.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1623
01:12:43.350 --> 01:12:44.220
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1624
01:12:44.910 --> 01:12:47.490
<v Speaker 2>indigenous Australia don't seem to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>that desire.</v>

1625
01:12:47.491 --> 01:12:50.460
<v Speaker 2>They just happy with what they've got </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's something to be,</v>

1626
01:12:50.580 --> 01:12:53.070
<v Speaker 2>it's something to be envious of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1627
01:12:53.090 --> 01:12:53.923
<v Speaker 2>that they're just happy with that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they're not going to waste their </v>

1628
01:12:55.591 --> 01:12:58.290
<v Speaker 2>life going and chasing silly things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1629
01:12:58.370 --> 01:12:58.971
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1630
01:12:58.971 --> 01:13:01.310
<v Speaker 1>at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those things that you're chasing,</v>

1631
01:13:01.311 --> 01:13:03.540
<v Speaker 1>you can't take them with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

1632
01:13:03.680 --> 01:13:06.050
<v Speaker 1>And even if you leave them behind for </v>
<v Speaker 1>your family,</v>

1633
01:13:06.051 --> 01:13:06.570
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

1634
01:13:06.570 --> 01:13:08.540
<v Speaker 1>they're only going to enjoy them until </v>
<v Speaker 1>they stop living,</v>

1635
01:13:08.860 --> 01:13:10.250
<v Speaker 1>but will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will.</v>

1636
01:13:10.390 --> 01:13:14.600
<v Speaker 1>It's like the masterpieces enjoying your</v>
<v Speaker 1>life to the utmost and having the most,</v>

1637
01:13:14.960 --> 01:13:18.290
<v Speaker 1>the most success with your family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with your friends,</v>

1638
01:13:18.291 --> 01:13:20.120
<v Speaker 1>the most relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>success,</v>

1639
01:13:20.121 --> 01:13:22.970
<v Speaker 1>the most harmony with the people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you come in contact with.</v>

1640
01:13:23.420 --> 01:13:24.253
<v Speaker 1>But that doesn't seem to be rewarded the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same way in our world as someone who's </v>

1641
01:13:28.850 --> 01:13:31.680
<v Speaker 1>got some ball or house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I fucking helicopter picks him out,</v>

1642
01:13:31.681 --> 01:13:34.330
<v Speaker 1>but he's got golden underwear and.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that fight.</v>

1643
01:13:34.880 --> 01:13:35.713
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it does.</v>

1644
01:13:36.140 --> 01:13:36.973
<v Speaker 2>They can have that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can have that helicopter and I </v>

1645
01:13:38.211 --> 01:13:40.520
<v Speaker 2>guarantee that it fades and they want </v>
<v Speaker 2>something new.</v>

1646
01:13:40.521 --> 01:13:41.354
<v Speaker 2>There's something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's something new that you're </v>

1647
01:13:42.231 --> 01:13:43.064
<v Speaker 2>desiring past that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I've tried to train myself to </v>

1648
01:13:46.041 --> 01:13:46.874
<v Speaker 2>design and what I do desire now is </v>
<v Speaker 2>experiences like worldly experiences </v>

1649
01:13:50.900 --> 01:13:52.940
<v Speaker 2>coming to coming to America for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>month.</v>

1650
01:13:53.360 --> 01:13:54.193
<v Speaker 2>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd sell my if it meant to have to sell </v>

1651
01:13:55.521 --> 01:13:56.354
<v Speaker 2>the house that I'm in Kingwood kill me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I wouldn't know if I had to sell my </v>

1652
01:14:01.461 --> 01:14:04.700
<v Speaker 2>car to come to America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>America for a month,</v>

1653
01:14:04.760 --> 01:14:09.760
<v Speaker 2>I'd do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>drop it 100 percent because the it's.</v>

1654
01:14:10.340 --> 01:14:11.173
<v Speaker 2>And it's not even the stories that I'll </v>
<v Speaker 2>tell you or cam or or Antonio or one of </v>

1655
01:14:14.441 --> 01:14:17.050
<v Speaker 2>my friends back home.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not even those stories.</v>

1656
01:14:17.051 --> 01:14:20.350
<v Speaker 2>It's the stories within myself and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience within myself.</v>

1657
01:14:20.440 --> 01:14:21.273
<v Speaker 2>That's where the real value is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the real currency of this world </v>

1658
01:14:25.090 --> 01:14:29.680
<v Speaker 2>is what's inside me right now and how I </v>
<v Speaker 2>feel after doing this trip and this trip</v>

1659
01:14:29.681 --> 01:14:31.600
<v Speaker 2>was miserable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I won't lie to you,</v>

1660
01:14:31.890 --> 01:14:33.790
<v Speaker 2>but it's an enjoyable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>miserable.</v>

1661
01:14:33.791 --> 01:14:37.630
<v Speaker 2>How do you work that shit out?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How could been in the snow?</v>

1662
01:14:37.631 --> 01:14:41.340
<v Speaker 2>Being wet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>flogging myself out for 16,</v>

1663
01:14:41.360 --> 01:14:45.040
<v Speaker 2>17 hours every day into the dark of </v>
<v Speaker 2>night and getting back into the camp.</v>

1664
01:14:45.340 --> 01:14:47.860
<v Speaker 2>Been miserable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How could that be enjoyable?</v>

1665
01:14:48.040 --> 01:14:49.690
<v Speaker 2>Because the second you get back to camp,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

1666
01:14:49.790 --> 01:14:51.190
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a fire.</v>

1667
01:14:51.220 --> 01:14:54.910
<v Speaker 2>That's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Second you lay down yet I'm just like,</v>

1668
01:14:54.911 --> 01:14:56.340
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so good to lay down.</v>

1669
01:14:56.350 --> 01:15:00.040
<v Speaker 2>It's like you've got to go through </v>
<v Speaker 2>hardship to find the good shit in life.</v>

1670
01:15:00.480 --> 01:15:01.313
<v Speaker 1>I went through this a five days on </v>
<v Speaker 1>Prince of Wales island with Rinella and </v>

1671
01:15:04.891 --> 01:15:07.110
<v Speaker 1>my friend Brian Callahan and it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>raining every day.</v>

1672
01:15:07.130 --> 01:15:10.340
<v Speaker 1>It's just pouring rain everyday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The hunt was unsuccessful,</v>

1673
01:15:10.470 --> 01:15:12.600
<v Speaker 1>unsuccessful to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We didn't get a deer,</v>

1674
01:15:12.780 --> 01:15:15.240
<v Speaker 1>but we came back and I was so happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

1675
01:15:15.241 --> 01:15:17.880
<v Speaker 1>the sun is so warm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so nice.</v>

1676
01:15:17.881 --> 01:15:19.070
<v Speaker 1>There's no rain and I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

1677
01:15:19.140 --> 01:15:21.540
<v Speaker 1>I this the same as it is today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is beautiful.</v>

1678
01:15:21.541 --> 01:15:22.374
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was beautiful today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't really appreciate it the </v>

1679
01:15:24.241 --> 01:15:26.880
<v Speaker 1>way I appreciated it when I came back </v>
<v Speaker 1>from Prince of Wales.</v>

1680
01:15:26.910 --> 01:15:27.631
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely.</v>

1681
01:15:27.631 --> 01:15:28.464
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really do believe that you have to go </v>

1682
01:15:30.031 --> 01:15:33.270
<v Speaker 1>through some difficulty to appreciate </v>
<v Speaker 1>good stuff.</v>

1683
01:15:33.271 --> 01:15:34.104
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're born into like a super </v>
<v Speaker 1>wealthy multibillionaire family and </v>

1684
01:15:38.881 --> 01:15:41.250
<v Speaker 1>you've got a Ferrari when you're 16 and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1685
01:15:41.251 --> 01:15:42.084
<v Speaker 1>you drive around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fly around everywhere in private jets </v>

1686
01:15:43.831 --> 01:15:44.664
<v Speaker 1>and you live in a giant mansion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't think that you can ever </v>

1687
01:15:46.930 --> 01:15:51.250
<v Speaker 1>appreciate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Definitely not the difficulty I work for</v>

1688
01:15:51.430 --> 01:15:52.960
<v Speaker 2>what I've got today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1689
01:15:52.961 --> 01:15:56.080
<v Speaker 2>and then like I had a hard upbringing </v>
<v Speaker 2>and stuff like that.</v>

1690
01:15:56.410 --> 01:15:58.240
<v Speaker 2>My father was abusive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>alcoholic,</v>

1691
01:15:58.680 --> 01:15:59.513
<v Speaker 2>lived on the streets for some time and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>really believe that put me where I am </v>

1692
01:16:04.691 --> 01:16:07.110
<v Speaker 2>with my family.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I absolutely adore my family.</v>

1693
01:16:07.150 --> 01:16:08.950
<v Speaker 2>Do anything for my wife and kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>

1694
01:16:09.100 --> 01:16:10.990
<v Speaker 2>Cut My arms off and sell them if I had </v>
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>

1695
01:16:11.770 --> 01:16:15.310
<v Speaker 2>That's because of the hardship that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>had when I was growing up and,</v>

1696
01:16:15.460 --> 01:16:16.293
<v Speaker 2>and lot my business is very successful </v>
<v Speaker 2>today and I believe that's because I </v>

1697
01:16:19.271 --> 01:16:20.950
<v Speaker 2>didn't have anything growing up as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>kid.</v>

1698
01:16:21.460 --> 01:16:22.810
<v Speaker 2>We Will Paul.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We will.</v>

<v Speaker 2>we had nothing.</v>

1701
01:16:25.511 --> 01:16:26.344
<v Speaker 2>We didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we didn't do christmases because there </v>

1702
01:16:28.421 --> 01:16:29.254
<v Speaker 2>was no money to do Christmas and coming </v>
<v Speaker 2>from a broken family like that to now </v>

1703
01:16:34.270 --> 01:16:35.103
<v Speaker 2>have mine family that I don't know how </v>
<v Speaker 2>to treat them right because of how we </v>

1704
01:16:39.191 --> 01:16:41.680
<v Speaker 2>will treat it so wrong as kids and how </v>
<v Speaker 2>my mother was treated.</v>

1705
01:16:42.010 --> 01:16:46.090
<v Speaker 2>I know how to treat Kim or it's how </v>
<v Speaker 2>unproven that,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you love your family to death.</v>

1708
01:16:51.481 --> 01:16:52.314
<v Speaker 2>You do absolutely anything for them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the biggest thing that I'm proud of </v>

1709
01:16:56.351 --> 01:16:58.320
<v Speaker 2>in life is having the family that I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>got today.</v>

1710
01:16:58.380 --> 01:16:59.720
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like bowhunting aside,</v>

1711
01:16:59.780 --> 01:17:01.300
<v Speaker 2>I'd man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd dropped bow hunting.</v>

1712
01:17:01.540 --> 01:17:05.440
<v Speaker 2>You know how much I love bow hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll drop balancing for my family.</v>

1713
01:17:05.860 --> 01:17:07.050
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to do it it.</v>

1714
01:17:07.070 --> 01:17:08.960
<v Speaker 1>Kim's listening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Luckily,</v>

1715
01:17:09.050 --> 01:17:10.820
<v Speaker 1>don't have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

1716
01:17:10.821 --> 01:17:13.460
<v Speaker 1>that is an interesting thing how people </v>
<v Speaker 1>come from.</v>

1717
01:17:13.540 --> 01:17:17.330
<v Speaker 1>A lot of folks that come from abusive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>alcoholic families,</v>

1718
01:17:17.720 --> 01:17:21.340
<v Speaker 1>they wind up being like really </v>
<v Speaker 1>considerate.</v>

1719
01:17:21.380 --> 01:17:26.380
<v Speaker 1>It really compassionate and really </v>
<v Speaker 1>dedicated to keeping on the straight and</v>

1720
01:17:26.451 --> 01:17:27.400
<v Speaker 1>narrow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1721
01:17:27.650 --> 01:17:31.310
<v Speaker 1>my friend Maurice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he grew up with an alcoholic grandmother</v>

1722
01:17:31.311 --> 01:17:32.144
<v Speaker 1>who raised him and they used to uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ladies to lock them in a room and </v>

1723
01:17:36.531 --> 01:17:37.364
<v Speaker 1>just leave them there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why they would go out drinking and he </v>

1724
01:17:39.111 --> 01:17:41.900
<v Speaker 1>couldn't get out of the room is no food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was always hungry and never,</v>

1725
01:17:41.901 --> 01:17:43.280
<v Speaker 1>never drank in his whole life.</v>

1726
01:17:43.340 --> 01:17:44.173
<v Speaker 2>I'm a nondrinker and it's just because </v>
<v Speaker 2>of how I say my house St my father was </v>

1727
01:17:47.961 --> 01:17:48.794
<v Speaker 2>drinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe I wouldn't be like that </v>

1728
01:17:50.811 --> 01:17:53.840
<v Speaker 2>drinking because I'm just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I care about the person on the street.</v>

1729
01:17:53.841 --> 01:17:56.510
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the sort of person that I am.</v>

1730
01:17:56.780 --> 01:17:58.980
<v Speaker 2>So I don't believe I would be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1731
01:17:59.300 --> 01:18:00.133
<v Speaker 2>the violent drunk that my father was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's something I don't want to even </v>

1732
01:18:03.261 --> 01:18:04.094
<v Speaker 2>promote to my kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even want to promote it to me </v>

1733
01:18:05.541 --> 01:18:06.374
<v Speaker 2>friends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So all my drink and I don't need to </v>

1734
01:18:08.091 --> 01:18:09.530
<v Speaker 2>drink.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm silly enough as you can tell.</v>

1735
01:18:10.050 --> 01:18:12.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen that many times,</v>

1736
01:18:12.431 --> 01:18:13.264
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People who grew up in that sort of </v>

1737
01:18:14.711 --> 01:18:15.544
<v Speaker 1>abusive substance abusing family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they grow up and they're clean as a </v>

1738
01:18:19.961 --> 01:18:21.520
<v Speaker 1>whistle and they don't have nothing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do with it.</v>

1739
01:18:21.680 --> 01:18:23.150
<v Speaker 1>It makes total sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1740
01:18:23.250 --> 01:18:24.370
<v Speaker 1>Tangier off it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1741
01:18:24.371 --> 01:18:25.840
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting how that works,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1742
01:18:26.080 --> 01:18:30.550
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you have to see someone just </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking completely ruining their life in</v>

1743
01:18:30.551 --> 01:18:33.040
<v Speaker 1>order for you to get it in your head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that is not me.</v>

1744
01:18:33.110 --> 01:18:33.943
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I seen all the negatives in it and then </v>

1745
01:18:35.781 --> 01:18:38.360
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want any negatives in my life at</v>

1746
01:18:38.361 --> 01:18:40.040
<v Speaker 2>all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I'll do anything to avoid them,</v>

1747
01:18:40.041 --> 01:18:40.874
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's why I keep on the straight </v>

1748
01:18:41.601 --> 01:18:45.220
<v Speaker 2>and narrow and try and be a real </v>
<v Speaker 2>positive person is um,</v>

1749
01:18:45.770 --> 01:18:47.330
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just don't want any,</v>

1750
01:18:47.510 --> 01:18:48.343
<v Speaker 2>anything negative like that in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I've seen alcohol as being a </v>

1751
01:18:51.171 --> 01:18:54.470
<v Speaker 2>negative burrito because people do stuff</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they,</v>

1752
01:18:54.580 --> 01:18:57.650
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they usually wouldn't 100 percent,</v>

1753
01:18:57.710 --> 01:18:59.530
<v Speaker 2>but at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1754
01:19:00.830 --> 01:19:01.663
<v Speaker 2>I can be at work or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the guys are drinking and having a </v>

1755
01:19:03.531 --> 01:19:04.364
<v Speaker 2>good time and there's no issue at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She had all stay up all night with them </v>

1756
01:19:06.561 --> 01:19:07.690
<v Speaker 2>having a good laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1757
01:19:07.740 --> 01:19:10.970
<v Speaker 2>I just don't need it to have fun anymore</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I've never had it.</v>

1758
01:19:11.450 --> 01:19:12.680
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1759
01:19:12.950 --> 01:19:14.230
<v Speaker 2>and obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1760
01:19:14.240 --> 01:19:16.220
<v Speaker 2>have been turned off it as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a young bloke.</v>

1761
01:19:16.640 --> 01:19:18.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's not necessary.</v>

1762
01:19:18.201 --> 01:19:20.480
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's a social lubricant and end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1763
01:19:20.481 --> 01:19:23.630
<v Speaker 2>I enjoy it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't grow up in an alcoholic</v>

1764
01:19:23.720 --> 01:19:24.553
<v Speaker 1>environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I grew up in a violent environment and </v>

1765
01:19:25.580 --> 01:19:27.170
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1766
01:19:27.171 --> 01:19:28.004
<v Speaker 1>domestic violence to me is a very scary </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing and I couldn't imagine ever </v>

1767
01:19:33.920 --> 01:19:36.290
<v Speaker 1>hitting my wife or hitting my kids are </v>
<v Speaker 1>hitting</v>

1768
01:19:36.690 --> 01:19:38.120
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't,</v>

1769
01:19:38.121 --> 01:19:40.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like,</v>

1770
01:19:40.101 --> 01:19:40.934
<v Speaker 2>it was so stressful growing up as a kid </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I think that's why I've tried to </v>

1771
01:19:44.001 --> 01:19:47.120
<v Speaker 2>live my life without any stress now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And having a business.</v>

1772
01:19:47.210 --> 01:19:49.340
<v Speaker 2>My own business can be stressful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I've,</v>

1773
01:19:49.580 --> 01:19:50.413
<v Speaker 2>I've tried to grow up without having any</v>
<v Speaker 2>stress and just to have a figure like </v>

1774
01:19:56.331 --> 01:19:57.164
<v Speaker 2>that in your life growing up as kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got two sisters as well that were </v>

1775
01:19:59.481 --> 01:20:01.520
<v Speaker 2>obviously affected by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by it as well.</v>

1776
01:20:01.920 --> 01:20:05.630
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a little bit like feeding your kids</v>

1777
01:20:05.631 --> 01:20:07.740
<v Speaker 2>the wrong vegetables and not feeding </v>
<v Speaker 2>them life,</v>

1778
01:20:07.800 --> 01:20:09.880
<v Speaker 2>but for mental health,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1779
01:20:10.410 --> 01:20:13.810
<v Speaker 2>domestic violence is so ruining in that </v>
<v Speaker 2>sense that,</v>

1780
01:20:13.940 --> 01:20:16.800
<v Speaker 2>that it just destroys mental health.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had,</v>

1781
01:20:16.860 --> 01:20:17.693
<v Speaker 2>I've used it as fuel myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I know a lot of people don't and it </v>

1782
01:20:21.160 --> 01:20:24.150
<v Speaker 2>actually affects them as they get older.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It affects them more and more.</v>

1783
01:20:24.870 --> 01:20:25.703
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it also affects if you see violence too </v>

1784
01:20:27.871 --> 01:20:29.040
<v Speaker 1>often in the car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>

1785
01:20:29.041 --> 01:20:29.874
<v Speaker 1>I should really expand on this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the violence that I saw was </v>

1786
01:20:33.931 --> 01:20:35.400
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It means,</v>

1787
01:20:35.430 --> 01:20:36.263
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my dad hit my mom a few times xeno he </v>

1788
01:20:38.071 --> 01:20:40.470
<v Speaker 1>smacked her around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw him hit some other people do.</v>

1789
01:20:40.680 --> 01:20:41.260
<v Speaker 1>He's just,</v>

1790
01:20:41.260 --> 01:20:42.230
<v Speaker 2>that's alright.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1791
01:20:42.290 --> 01:20:42.930
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's an,</v>

1792
01:20:42.930 --> 01:20:43.550
<v Speaker 2>that's enough.</v>

1793
01:20:43.550 --> 01:20:44.383
<v Speaker 1>That's bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's not violence in comparison to </v>

1794
01:20:46.751 --> 01:20:47.584
<v Speaker 1>say he never hit me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen many people who've lived way </v>

1795
01:20:51.071 --> 01:20:54.340
<v Speaker 1>more violent upbringing way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>way worse than what I've seen,</v>

1796
01:20:54.790 --> 01:20:59.790
<v Speaker 1>but one of the things that happens to </v>
<v Speaker 1>young people when they see violence on a</v>

1797
01:21:00.011 --> 01:21:05.011
<v Speaker 1>regular basis is your brain gets </v>
<v Speaker 1>programmed to accept,</v>

1798
01:21:05.290 --> 01:21:06.123
<v Speaker 1>not just accept that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to be wary of that and to be ready </v>

1799
01:21:09.161 --> 01:21:12.700
<v Speaker 1>to respond to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you develop a much quicker temper</v>

1800
01:21:12.880 --> 01:21:16.090
<v Speaker 1>and your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the consequences of being in a dangerous</v>

1801
01:21:16.091 --> 01:21:16.924
<v Speaker 1>situation become much more real and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're much more likely to act in a </v>

1802
01:21:20.441 --> 01:21:22.600
<v Speaker 1>violent way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when children see violence,</v>

1803
01:21:22.601 --> 01:21:25.780
<v Speaker 1>you see people getting hit and they see </v>
<v Speaker 1>that kind of shit on a regular basis.</v>

1804
01:21:26.190 --> 01:21:27.820
<v Speaker 1>The norm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it becomes normal.</v>

1805
01:21:27.821 --> 01:21:29.950
<v Speaker 1>It becomes an option,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1806
01:21:30.190 --> 01:21:33.910
<v Speaker 1>And it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just like programming.</v>

1807
01:21:34.030 --> 01:21:34.571
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1808
01:21:34.571 --> 01:21:35.620
<v Speaker 1>you have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have children,</v>

1809
01:21:35.830 --> 01:21:38.920
<v Speaker 1>like when you raise a kid like they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>so fast.</v>

1810
01:21:38.950 --> 01:21:39.783
<v Speaker 1>It's so fascinating to watch kids learn </v>
<v Speaker 1>and grow and you see what they respond </v>

1811
01:21:43.151 --> 01:21:43.984
<v Speaker 1>to and you see like when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you can talk to them and get them </v>

1812
01:21:47.951 --> 01:21:52.210
<v Speaker 1>alone and have fun with them and respond</v>
<v Speaker 1>and rationalize with them.</v>

1813
01:21:52.330 --> 01:21:54.220
<v Speaker 1>Like I try to talk to my kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they're adults.</v>

1814
01:21:54.490 --> 01:21:56.050
<v Speaker 1>I talked to them like they're little </v>
<v Speaker 1>kids,</v>

1815
01:21:56.051 --> 01:21:57.630
<v Speaker 1>like I give them a lot of love and a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of.</v>

1816
01:21:57.640 --> 01:22:01.470
<v Speaker 1>But I try to explain things like they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>really smart and uh,</v>

1817
01:22:01.540 --> 01:22:04.480
<v Speaker 2>probably I really like that my kids are </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

1818
01:22:04.570 --> 01:22:04.900
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1819
01:22:04.900 --> 01:22:05.733
<v Speaker 1>they get it kind of and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they keep asking questions and we </v>

1820
01:22:08.021 --> 01:22:09.020
<v Speaker 1>work it out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1821
01:22:09.021 --> 01:22:09.880
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does that mean?</v>

1822
01:22:10.060 --> 01:22:10.510
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

1823
01:22:10.510 --> 01:22:14.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've had conversations about what to do</v>

1824
01:22:14.051 --> 01:22:16.140
<v Speaker 1>if someone's being mean to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like my daughter was like,</v>

1825
01:22:16.150 --> 01:22:18.120
<v Speaker 1>someone's being mean to me at school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

1826
01:22:18.160 --> 01:22:19.480
<v Speaker 1>how are they being mean to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was like,</v>

1827
01:22:19.481 --> 01:22:21.550
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they said something mean about my hair.</v>

1828
01:22:21.551 --> 01:22:22.390
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

1829
01:22:22.391 --> 01:22:23.590
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you like your hair?</v>

1830
01:22:23.770 --> 01:22:24.461
<v Speaker 1>And she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1831
01:22:24.461 --> 01:22:25.121
<v Speaker 1>I like your hair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

1832
01:22:25.121 --> 01:22:27.480
<v Speaker 1>do you think they really think there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>something wrong with your haircut?</v>

1833
01:22:27.610 --> 01:22:29.770
<v Speaker 1>Or they try to make you feel bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She goes,</v>

1834
01:22:29.771 --> 01:22:31.090
<v Speaker 1>I just think they're mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

1835
01:22:31.091 --> 01:22:33.160
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it probably trying to make you feel bad.</v>

1836
01:22:33.161 --> 01:22:33.994
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so why do you think they're trying </v>

1837
01:22:34.481 --> 01:22:35.314
<v Speaker 1>to make you feel bad?</v>
<v Speaker 1>While a lot of it is because when kids </v>

1838
01:22:37.031 --> 01:22:37.864
<v Speaker 1>are little,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they realized that they can affect </v>

1839
01:22:39.671 --> 01:22:40.720
<v Speaker 1>someone and they don't.</v>

1840
01:22:40.720 --> 01:22:41.553
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they don't even understand that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to have a really bad feeling </v>

1841
01:22:43.811 --> 01:22:44.620
<v Speaker 1>on you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they,</v>

1842
01:22:44.620 --> 01:22:48.130
<v Speaker 1>it's like a toy that they can play with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they can say something mean and you</v>

1843
01:22:48.131 --> 01:22:48.964
<v Speaker 1>react and they realize it and this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that people have to get </v>

1844
01:22:51.581 --> 01:22:52.540
<v Speaker 1>through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

1845
01:22:52.541 --> 01:22:53.374
<v Speaker 1>what you should do is realize that how </v>
<v Speaker 1>that makes you feel and decide you're </v>

1846
01:22:56.951 --> 01:22:57.784
<v Speaker 1>never going to do that to somebody else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially not someone who's your </v>

1847
01:22:59.171 --> 01:23:00.004
<v Speaker 1>friend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we have these like long </v>

1848
01:23:01.031 --> 01:23:03.550
<v Speaker 1>conversations about feeling about </v>
<v Speaker 1>communication.</v>

1849
01:23:03.970 --> 01:23:08.170
<v Speaker 1>And then I explained to her always that </v>
<v Speaker 1>whenever I tell my kid about something,</v>

1850
01:23:08.171 --> 01:23:10.090
<v Speaker 1>I always say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever you've done,</v>

1851
01:23:10.240 --> 01:23:12.220
<v Speaker 1>I've done it worse and I'm dumber than </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

1852
01:23:12.890 --> 01:23:15.070
<v Speaker 1>For sure when I was your age because </v>
<v Speaker 1>she's very well.</v>

1853
01:23:15.220 --> 01:23:19.720
<v Speaker 1>Especially my eight year old who is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's the middle child,</v>

1854
01:23:19.721 --> 01:23:20.554
<v Speaker 1>but she's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1855
01:23:21.400 --> 01:23:23.320
<v Speaker 1>she's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's very curious and very,</v>

1856
01:23:23.321 --> 01:23:25.300
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very interested in progress.</v>

1857
01:23:25.300 --> 01:23:28.680
<v Speaker 1>Like we talk about things like getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>smarter or what you were.</v>

1858
01:23:28.810 --> 01:23:31.840
<v Speaker 1>One of the things I always say is I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're way smarter than I was when I was</v>

1859
01:23:31.841 --> 01:23:32.471
<v Speaker 1>eight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was eight.</v>

1860
01:23:32.471 --> 01:23:34.840
<v Speaker 1>I was really dumb and I did a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>stupid things,</v>

1861
01:23:34.841 --> 01:23:37.750
<v Speaker 1>but also it was a boy and I think it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little more reckless and impulsive and</v>

1862
01:23:37.751 --> 01:23:39.460
<v Speaker 1>a little crazier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm like,</v>

1863
01:23:39.490 --> 01:23:40.930
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so anything you've done,</v>

1864
01:23:40.960 --> 01:23:41.793
<v Speaker 1>like if you don't tell the truth about </v>
<v Speaker 1>something or if you blame somebody else </v>

1865
01:23:44.051 --> 01:23:45.610
<v Speaker 1>for something that you did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did it all.</v>

1866
01:23:45.700 --> 01:23:49.720
<v Speaker 1>I did all those things so I'm not mad at</v>
<v Speaker 1>you like it obviously worked out for me.</v>

1867
01:23:49.721 --> 01:23:50.650
<v Speaker 1>I'm here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm alive,</v>

1868
01:23:50.651 --> 01:23:53.080
<v Speaker 1>I'm healthy and have you so it's going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be okay.</v>

1869
01:23:53.350 --> 01:23:56.590
<v Speaker 1>So no one's going to not love you if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>make a mistake.</v>

1870
01:23:56.680 --> 01:23:58.330
<v Speaker 1>It's totally a part of being a person.</v>

1871
01:23:58.450 --> 01:24:00.970
<v Speaker 1>There's no way to navigate this life </v>
<v Speaker 1>without making mistakes.</v>

1872
01:24:01.450 --> 01:24:03.580
<v Speaker 1>So by having those kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversations with them,</v>

1873
01:24:03.581 --> 01:24:04.414
<v Speaker 1>I think I alleviate at least some of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>anxiety because kids are always worried </v>

1874
01:24:08.441 --> 01:24:11.380
<v Speaker 1>about how you feel about what they've </v>
<v Speaker 1>done.</v>

1875
01:24:11.440 --> 01:24:13.000
<v Speaker 1>Like they don't want you to be upset at </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

1876
01:24:13.001 --> 01:24:15.670
<v Speaker 1>They don't want you to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I always like because even if you do</v>

1877
01:24:15.671 --> 01:24:17.440
<v Speaker 1>something bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I still love you,</v>

1878
01:24:17.460 --> 01:24:21.700
<v Speaker 1>so that's part of life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I fucked up still as an adult,</v>

1879
01:24:21.701 --> 01:24:22.534
<v Speaker 1>as a 49 year old man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I still make stupid fucking mistakes in </v>

1880
01:24:25.151 --> 01:24:26.320
<v Speaker 1>the end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't even matter.</v>

1881
01:24:26.440 --> 01:24:27.730
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter.</v>

1882
01:24:27.770 --> 01:24:29.310
<v Speaker 1>It's just shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can get past.</v>

1883
01:24:29.311 --> 01:24:30.470
<v Speaker 1>It's all good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1884
01:24:30.650 --> 01:24:31.900
<v Speaker 1>So good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chill out people.</v>

1885
01:24:32.080 --> 01:24:33.510
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's hard to.</v>

1886
01:24:33.820 --> 01:24:34.421
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

1887
01:24:34.421 --> 01:24:37.870
<v Speaker 1>that's another thing that being in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>woods and being in the wild,</v>

1888
01:24:38.260 --> 01:24:39.093
<v Speaker 1>like when you see a fucking 11 foot tall</v>
<v Speaker 1>grizzly bear sleeping on an elk carcass </v>

1889
01:24:42.821 --> 01:24:43.840
<v Speaker 1>and you're by yourself.</v>

1890
01:24:44.500 --> 01:24:45.333
<v Speaker 1>Boy does like insults about a haircut </v>
<v Speaker 1>was getting mad at each other on the </v>

1891
01:24:52.391 --> 01:24:54.250
<v Speaker 1>playground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was so fucking stupid.</v>

1892
01:24:54.251 --> 01:24:55.600
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at this thing.</v>

1893
01:24:55.601 --> 01:24:57.180
<v Speaker 1>This thing is could hate me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1894
01:24:57.560 --> 01:24:58.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that funny?</v>

1895
01:24:58.990 --> 01:25:00.790
<v Speaker 1>It is funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I mean again,</v>

1896
01:25:00.791 --> 01:25:01.624
<v Speaker 1>like you were saying about how being in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the woods and then coming back here </v>

1897
01:25:03.431 --> 01:25:03.740
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

1898
01:25:03.740 --> 01:25:06.010
<v Speaker 1>I could just hit a switch and I could.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

1899
01:25:06.300 --> 01:25:08.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>having that perspective and being out in</v>

1900
01:25:08.951 --> 01:25:09.784
<v Speaker 1>the wild,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he does.</v>

1901
01:25:09.790 --> 01:25:10.623
<v Speaker 1>It's an one more thing that gives you </v>
<v Speaker 1>this sort of a greater picture of how </v>

1902
01:25:15.280 --> 01:25:19.360
<v Speaker 1>bizarre and amazing life really is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have this thing.</v>

1903
01:25:19.480 --> 01:25:20.950
<v Speaker 1>No use crying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was built milk.</v>

1904
01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:21.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1905
01:25:21.640 --> 01:25:23.050
<v Speaker 1>we have that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we invented it.</v>

1906
01:25:23.140 --> 01:25:26.540
<v Speaker 1>I think you guys bought it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we invented the lower wifi.</v>

1907
01:25:26.680 --> 01:25:27.513
<v Speaker 1>You guys invented Wifi?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe that one guy's probably </v>

1908
01:25:30.011 --> 01:25:30.860
<v Speaker 1>American ex.</v>

1909
01:25:30.870 --> 01:25:31.703
<v Speaker 1>Pat Probably went over there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>claimed Australia probably heightened </v>

1910
01:25:34.391 --> 01:25:35.890
<v Speaker 1>for his taxes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1911
01:25:36.120 --> 01:25:36.953
<v Speaker 1>like I just live by.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no use crying over spilled milk </v>

1912
01:25:38.980 --> 01:25:39.813
<v Speaker 1>like it's happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if there's even something </v>

1913
01:25:41.501 --> 01:25:42.334
<v Speaker 1>stressful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's done now let's just deal with it </v>

1914
01:25:44.321 --> 01:25:46.600
<v Speaker 1>because it's done now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no use carrying on about it.</v>

1915
01:25:47.290 --> 01:25:48.123
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't make anything any better than</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like let's just deal with the </v>

1916
01:25:50.971 --> 01:25:53.320
<v Speaker 1>situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's just get beyond it.</v>

1917
01:25:53.650 --> 01:25:54.483
<v Speaker 1>But it's so common to be upset about it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and everybody else does it and it </v>

1918
01:25:56.681 --> 01:25:58.720
<v Speaker 1>becomes a pattern.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see it and you know.</v>

1919
01:25:58.721 --> 01:25:59.554
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm guilty of it myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've gotten upset about stupid shit </v>

1920
01:26:01.571 --> 01:26:02.404
<v Speaker 1>before too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes just a perspective thing </v>

1921
01:26:04.520 --> 01:26:07.370
<v Speaker 1>and also sometimes it's a busy thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like sometimes you become.</v>

1922
01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:09.620
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm guilty of this.</v>

1923
01:26:09.690 --> 01:26:12.980
<v Speaker 1>I'll do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll do too many things and in doing too</v>

1924
01:26:12.981 --> 01:26:13.814
<v Speaker 1>many things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes I get my stress level too </v>

1925
01:26:15.621 --> 01:26:18.050
<v Speaker 1>high,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like my base stress levels.</v>

1926
01:26:18.051 --> 01:26:18.884
<v Speaker 1>Like there's too many things I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>managing all at once and then I can be </v>

1927
01:26:21.771 --> 01:26:22.604
<v Speaker 1>irritable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stuff that I shouldn't be irritable </v>

1928
01:26:24.441 --> 01:26:24.880
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

1929
01:26:24.880 --> 01:26:25.713
<v Speaker 2>Kim's design.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kim's got a little business pretty </v>

1930
01:26:27.411 --> 01:26:31.460
<v Speaker 2>little potty and she gets so busy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she'll get caught out with at that.</v>

1931
01:26:31.490 --> 01:26:33.710
<v Speaker 2>She'll get to the point and she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck,</v>

1932
01:26:33.711 --> 01:26:36.410
<v Speaker 2>I've just got to slow down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got to do less.</v>

1933
01:26:36.740 --> 01:26:39.170
<v Speaker 2>I've got to do less so I can actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>feed in more things,</v>

1934
01:26:39.171 --> 01:26:42.260
<v Speaker 2>but more things that I enjoy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

1935
01:26:42.470 --> 01:26:43.303
<v Speaker 2>but at least she's got that outlook </v>
<v Speaker 2>least she gets to that point and she's </v>

1936
01:26:45.981 --> 01:26:46.701
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1937
01:26:46.701 --> 01:26:48.020
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm getting too busy,</v>

1938
01:26:48.080 --> 01:26:48.913
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm actually losing quality time with </v>

1939
01:26:50.690 --> 01:26:53.840
<v Speaker 2>whatever in life that she enjoys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

1940
01:26:54.500 --> 01:26:55.333
<v Speaker 2>I used to be the side of the business </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I'd put it in these crazy hours </v>

1941
01:26:57.411 --> 01:26:58.270
<v Speaker 2>with the business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1942
01:26:58.670 --> 01:27:02.420
<v Speaker 2>I practically built the business so it </v>
<v Speaker 2>could support itself and I can walk away</v>

1943
01:27:02.421 --> 01:27:05.960
<v Speaker 2>and go bow hunting and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but to get to that point,</v>

1944
01:27:05.961 --> 01:27:08.630
<v Speaker 2>I put in a few years of just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd be out,</v>

1945
01:27:08.780 --> 01:27:09.613
<v Speaker 2>I'd be up until 1:00</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the morning and doing things for the </v>

1946
01:27:10.971 --> 01:27:13.280
<v Speaker 2>business and trying to keep it growing.</v>

1947
01:27:13.280 --> 01:27:18.280
<v Speaker 2>And then how big do you want it because </v>
<v Speaker 2>the more shit you have in life,</v>

1948
01:27:18.870 --> 01:27:21.650
<v Speaker 2>in business,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all those sorts of things,</v>

1949
01:27:22.070 --> 01:27:25.520
<v Speaker 2>the less time you actually have in life </v>
<v Speaker 2>to do the things that you want.</v>

1950
01:27:25.540 --> 01:27:28.190
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I got to the point and I'm like,</v>

1951
01:27:28.191 --> 01:27:29.024
<v Speaker 2>well I don't really want the business to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be any bigger than it is now unless I </v>

1952
01:27:32.241 --> 01:27:34.040
<v Speaker 2>get into some other managers and things </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

1953
01:27:34.041 --> 01:27:35.540
<v Speaker 2>And it's just fine in that point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1954
01:27:35.541 --> 01:27:36.374
<v Speaker 2>Stop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you've really not enjoying life </v>

1955
01:27:38.241 --> 01:27:39.630
<v Speaker 2>anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1956
01:27:39.650 --> 01:27:41.390
<v Speaker 2>Let's just roll it back a little bit.</v>

1957
01:27:42.060 --> 01:27:43.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've done that more this year.</v>

1958
01:27:44.070 --> 01:27:44.903
<v Speaker 1>I used to do all the UFC pay per views </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I used to do the Fox events too and </v>

1959
01:27:49.471 --> 01:27:52.590
<v Speaker 1>I cut it back to only North American </v>
<v Speaker 1>paper reviews.</v>

1960
01:27:52.591 --> 01:27:56.250
<v Speaker 1>No More Fox and I cut it in half so I </v>
<v Speaker 1>can blame bow hunting.</v>

1961
01:27:56.720 --> 01:27:59.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit,</v>

1962
01:27:59.040 --> 01:28:01.910
<v Speaker 1>I need time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's part of the problem I was.</v>

1963
01:28:02.230 --> 01:28:03.063
<v Speaker 1>I was telling you on the way over here </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I really think I need to do a </v>

1964
01:28:04.801 --> 01:28:09.450
<v Speaker 1>bowhunting tv show just so I can have an</v>
<v Speaker 1>excuse to go more so I don't.</v>

1965
01:28:09.730 --> 01:28:11.370
<v Speaker 1>I listen to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got to go to work.</v>

1966
01:28:11.490 --> 01:28:14.330
<v Speaker 1>Can't just an attendance dry it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>

1967
01:28:14.340 --> 01:28:15.520
<v Speaker 1>You gotta to come in and hunting with </v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

1968
01:28:15.600 --> 01:28:16.890
<v Speaker 1>You can only see it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1969
01:28:16.891 --> 01:28:19.830
<v Speaker 1>You can only see it as an online in </v>
<v Speaker 1>China,</v>

1970
01:28:19.831 --> 01:28:21.630
<v Speaker 1>but it's going to be huge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1971
01:28:21.940 --> 01:28:24.670
<v Speaker 1>I don't know man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is A.</v>

1972
01:28:24.670 --> 01:28:25.503
<v Speaker 1>There's definitely a a line that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>cross between not doing enough and then </v>

1973
01:28:28.831 --> 01:28:29.664
<v Speaker 1>doing the right amount and then doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>too much and knowing how to pull it </v>

1974
01:28:32.191 --> 01:28:34.350
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to pull things back though.</v>

1975
01:28:34.500 --> 01:28:35.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most people they.</v>

1976
01:28:35.881 --> 01:28:38.130
<v Speaker 1>They feel like if they're not moving </v>
<v Speaker 1>forward,</v>

1977
01:28:38.131 --> 01:28:40.620
<v Speaker 1>they're moving backward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they're not doing more,</v>

1978
01:28:40.621 --> 01:28:42.180
<v Speaker 1>they're doing less.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1979
01:28:42.270 --> 01:28:43.980
<v Speaker 1>That's the human condition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

1980
01:28:44.340 --> 01:28:45.390
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's part of this,</v>

1981
01:28:45.391 --> 01:28:46.224
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1982
01:28:46.260 --> 01:28:48.900
<v Speaker 1>go get them society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially in America.</v>

1983
01:28:49.110 --> 01:28:49.943
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know exactly what the attitude </v>

1984
01:28:51.361 --> 01:28:52.590
<v Speaker 1>is over in Australia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that right?</v>

1985
01:28:53.280 --> 01:28:55.530
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's different with different people,</v>

1986
01:28:55.531 --> 01:28:59.370
<v Speaker 2>but I'll have an hour at home if it </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't even have to be something I want</v>

1987
01:28:59.371 --> 01:29:02.880
<v Speaker 2>to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can be doing housework on the house or</v>

1988
01:29:02.881 --> 01:29:03.714
<v Speaker 2>doing something at work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't even have to be something </v>

1989
01:29:05.101 --> 01:29:05.934
<v Speaker 2>that I actually want to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if I'm not doing something for an </v>

1990
01:29:08.250 --> 01:29:09.840
<v Speaker 2>hour,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am bored shitless dude.</v>

1991
01:29:10.110 --> 01:29:12.880
<v Speaker 2>Like hide the knives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to cut my wrist,</v>

1992
01:29:13.490 --> 01:29:15.570
<v Speaker 2>like bored,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bored shitless.</v>

1993
01:29:15.571 --> 01:29:17.250
<v Speaker 2>Like I need to be doing something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like I said,</v>

1994
01:29:17.251 --> 01:29:18.660
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't even have to be something I </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to do,</v>

1995
01:29:18.900 --> 01:29:20.220
<v Speaker 2>but I have to have something to do.</v>

1996
01:29:20.440 --> 01:29:21.273
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that I realized how to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do or learned how to do over the last </v>

1997
01:29:24.790 --> 01:29:27.820
<v Speaker 1>few years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going an actual vacation where I go</v>

1998
01:29:27.910 --> 01:29:28.743
<v Speaker 1>and I could just sit on the beach and </v>
<v Speaker 1>drink Margaritas and put my feet up </v>

1999
01:29:32.230 --> 01:29:33.920
<v Speaker 1>because they play with my kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2000
01:29:34.150 --> 01:29:36.870
<v Speaker 1>I can't go fishing though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2001
01:29:38.320 --> 01:29:43.320
<v Speaker 1>we were organizing a trip recently to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hawaii and I was saying I forgot all the</v>

2002
01:29:43.610 --> 01:29:45.910
<v Speaker 1>NIH.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can have access to exactly who god was</v>

2003
01:29:45.911 --> 01:29:48.340
<v Speaker 1>shine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the problem is I'll be up at 6:00</v>

2004
01:29:48.341 --> 01:29:49.750
<v Speaker 1>in the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I won't see my family.</v>

2005
01:29:49.760 --> 01:29:50.593
<v Speaker 1>It's like they're at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2006
01:29:51.100 --> 01:29:52.290
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not a.</v>

2007
01:29:52.310 --> 01:29:53.143
<v Speaker 1>that's not a vacation your vacation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But fishing is like fishing is easy and </v>

2008
01:29:56.831 --> 01:30:00.060
<v Speaker 1>they liked my kids like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fun bringing,</v>

2009
01:30:00.160 --> 01:30:00.993
<v Speaker 1>bringing kids to Australia to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll take you out in some mad fishing </v>

2010
01:30:02.930 --> 01:30:05.290
<v Speaker 1>network.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Australia is a strange place,</v>

2011
01:30:05.291 --> 01:30:07.810
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is one of the things I was a 16</v>

2012
01:30:07.811 --> 01:30:09.430
<v Speaker 1>hour flight away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that too,</v>

2013
01:30:09.520 --> 01:30:10.353
<v Speaker 1>but it's also a strange place in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>like what they've done in America with </v>

2014
01:30:14.921 --> 01:30:16.970
<v Speaker 1>reintroducing wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

2015
01:30:17.050 --> 01:30:17.883
<v Speaker 1>what they've done in Australia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I think is really bizarre is feral </v>

2016
01:30:21.221 --> 01:30:25.390
<v Speaker 1>cats and foxes to deal with some of the.</v>

2017
01:30:25.680 --> 01:30:28.610
<v Speaker 2>That's some of the shit never works to </v>
<v Speaker 2>grow it.</v>

2018
01:30:28.660 --> 01:30:29.493
<v Speaker 2>Rabbit's tail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They brought wrap to fade one of the </v>

2019
01:30:30.971 --> 01:30:34.520
<v Speaker 2>early colonies within Australia because </v>
<v Speaker 2>that was for the paypal,</v>

2020
01:30:34.521 --> 01:30:35.900
<v Speaker 2>a rabbit's with paypal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The height.</v>

2021
01:30:36.010 --> 01:30:37.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why I brought him in.</v>

2022
01:30:37.090 --> 01:30:39.310
<v Speaker 1>Food source.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well all the animals in Australia,</v>

2023
01:30:39.311 --> 01:30:41.320
<v Speaker 1>so particularly New Zealand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the game animals,</v>

2024
01:30:41.380 --> 01:30:43.300
<v Speaker 1>all of them have been introduced from </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere else.</v>

2025
01:30:43.301 --> 01:30:44.070
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's great.</v>

2026
01:30:44.070 --> 01:30:47.080
<v Speaker 1>Most so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The spaces are all gifts from royalty</v>

2027
01:30:47.220 --> 01:30:48.053
<v Speaker 2>along the way and.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you've got other species that </v>

2028
01:30:51.150 --> 01:30:51.983
<v Speaker 2>weren't gifts at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We just brought them in because we </v>

2029
01:30:52.831 --> 01:30:55.140
<v Speaker 2>thought it was gonna benefit Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but most of them,</v>

2030
01:30:55.290 --> 01:30:57.630
<v Speaker 2>if not all of them done the complete </v>
<v Speaker 2>opposite.</v>

2031
01:30:58.140 --> 01:31:00.300
<v Speaker 2>So they grow it in the Fox to look after</v>
<v Speaker 2>the rabbit.</v>

2032
01:31:00.480 --> 01:31:01.313
<v Speaker 2>Well there's so much other shit that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fox would just prefer to eat that's </v>

2033
01:31:03.631 --> 01:31:06.210
<v Speaker 2>easier than catching a rabbit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just hate that and that's it.</v>

2034
01:31:06.420 --> 01:31:07.253
<v Speaker 2>It's all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like the spaces that lives in </v>

2035
01:31:11.161 --> 01:31:12.810
<v Speaker 2>Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it's not like,</v>

2036
01:31:12.811 --> 01:31:13.644
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's something else we want to get rid </v>

2037
01:31:14.911 --> 01:31:15.321
<v Speaker 2>of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2038
01:31:15.321 --> 01:31:17.960
<v Speaker 2>it's something else we wanted to keep </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they're natives,</v>

2039
01:31:17.961 --> 01:31:19.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like ground nesting birds,</v>

2040
01:31:20.670 --> 01:31:21.503
<v Speaker 2>you name it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you spend enough time out in </v>

2041
01:31:23.941 --> 01:31:26.940
<v Speaker 2>the woods and you'll see just about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>craziest things.</v>

2042
01:31:26.941 --> 01:31:27.774
<v Speaker 2>And we've seen feral cats now because </v>
<v Speaker 2>the birds started nes than out on lakes </v>

2043
01:31:30.901 --> 01:31:32.970
<v Speaker 2>on old trees that were growing into </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2044
01:31:33.570 --> 01:31:34.403
<v Speaker 2>that'd be safe there right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The feral cats were swimming across the </v>

2045
01:31:38.041 --> 01:31:39.810
<v Speaker 2>lake at night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're actually seen this,</v>

2046
01:31:40.240 --> 01:31:42.480
<v Speaker 2>the light swimming across the lake at </v>
<v Speaker 2>night,</v>

2047
01:31:42.740 --> 01:31:43.573
<v Speaker 2>climb in these birds that are nesting in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the trees out on the lake and snatching </v>

2048
01:31:46.831 --> 01:31:50.020
<v Speaker 2>the chicks and the bird just devastating</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

2049
01:31:50.060 --> 01:31:52.070
<v Speaker 2>to our population of um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've</v>

2050
01:31:52.070 --> 01:31:54.570
<v Speaker 1>never heard of feral cat swimming and </v>
<v Speaker 1>allies.</v>

2051
01:31:54.610 --> 01:31:55.800
<v Speaker 1>He did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2052
01:31:55.820 --> 01:31:58.340
<v Speaker 1>So they just figured out how to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just figured out how to do it.</v>

2053
01:32:00.070 --> 01:32:02.020
<v Speaker 2>Made me body threat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They will bomb them up,</v>

2054
01:32:02.050 --> 01:32:02.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

2055
01:32:02.590 --> 01:32:05.080
<v Speaker 2>that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the is the point right there.</v>

2056
01:32:05.320 --> 01:32:09.880
<v Speaker 2>That's the right thing to do is get in </v>
<v Speaker 2>and Carlos cats out when it's to that,</v>

2057
01:32:09.940 --> 01:32:10.960
<v Speaker 2>to the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that sort of.</v>

2058
01:32:11.080 --> 01:32:11.913
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was what I was going to bring up </v>

2059
01:32:12.401 --> 01:32:14.560
<v Speaker 2>because when I was in Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you gave me some of your,</v>

2060
01:32:14.561 --> 01:32:15.394
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Australian bowhunting magazines and </v>

2061
01:32:17.031 --> 01:32:19.630
<v Speaker 2>these fucking pictures of hosing with </v>
<v Speaker 2>cats.</v>

2062
01:32:20.080 --> 01:32:23.800
<v Speaker 2>They've got a dead cat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a proud moment for her because of</v>

2063
01:32:23.940 --> 01:32:25.240
<v Speaker 2>had devastated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

2064
01:32:25.241 --> 01:32:26.710
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I understand.</v>

2065
01:32:26.740 --> 01:32:31.200
<v Speaker 2>I get it the same way coyotes are here </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the lawn and it up.</v>

2066
01:32:31.210 --> 01:32:32.650
<v Speaker 2>I'm not thinking about shooting me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cut It home.</v>

2067
01:32:32.651 --> 01:32:33.880
<v Speaker 2>That's different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a cat.</v>

2068
01:32:34.300 --> 01:32:37.780
<v Speaker 2>It's got a collar on and it's got a bill</v>
<v Speaker 2>on and it stays at the house.</v>

2069
01:32:37.900 --> 01:32:40.630
<v Speaker 2>But isn't that bizarre?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you love that cat.</v>

2070
01:32:40.870 --> 01:32:44.260
<v Speaker 2>Another cat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'll shoot dogs dingoes and you've got</v>

2071
01:32:44.261 --> 01:32:45.094
<v Speaker 2>feral dogs and feral dogs that just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's just a domestic dog that's gone </v>

2072
01:32:49.211 --> 01:32:52.550
<v Speaker 2>wild and they're the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now we'll kill that.</v>

2073
01:32:52.930 --> 01:32:55.960
<v Speaker 2>Devastating to our population of </v>
<v Speaker 2>wildlife.</v>

2074
01:32:57.930 --> 01:33:00.080
<v Speaker 2>Wombats take good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hit it.</v>

2075
01:33:00.090 --> 01:33:00.923
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kidneys will get harassed if sending a </v>

2076
01:33:02.291 --> 01:33:03.310
<v Speaker 2>kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No Kid,</v>

2077
01:33:03.311 --> 01:33:04.240
<v Speaker 2>no kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

2078
01:33:04.390 --> 01:33:06.490
<v Speaker 2>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a porcupine,</v>

2079
01:33:07.090 --> 01:33:07.923
<v Speaker 2>but hate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cool.</v>

2080
01:33:07.930 --> 01:33:08.570
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

2081
01:33:08.570 --> 01:33:13.090
<v Speaker 2>it looks cool and you'll walk out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have wolves.</v>

2082
01:33:13.360 --> 01:33:14.193
<v Speaker 2>You don't even have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoops.</v>

2083
01:33:14.440 --> 01:33:16.900
<v Speaker 2>Goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I would eat a wolf hall.</v>

2084
01:33:16.960 --> 01:33:18.400
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how dare you.</v>

2085
01:33:18.850 --> 01:33:20.560
<v Speaker 2>That's so not true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How big is the Dingo?</v>

2086
01:33:20.670 --> 01:33:22.150
<v Speaker 2>I'm not as big as a wolf.</v>

2087
01:33:24.350 --> 01:33:25.183
<v Speaker 2>I'm bullshit and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's crazy because you guys are so </v>

2088
01:33:28.421 --> 01:33:29.254
<v Speaker 2>scared to coming out to true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could snakes and spiders and I'm in </v>

2089
01:33:31.331 --> 01:33:34.840
<v Speaker 2>the Bush here for one day and there's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>giant frigging Grizzly Bay.</v>

2090
01:33:34.841 --> 01:33:38.180
<v Speaker 2>Look at my tent and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll take the spot.</v>

2091
01:33:38.181 --> 01:33:40.690
<v Speaker 2>Isn't snakes please?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think it grizzly bears carry than</v>

2092
01:33:40.691 --> 01:33:43.090
<v Speaker 2>a Croc?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Crocs.</v>

2093
01:33:43.260 --> 01:33:45.220
<v Speaker 2>Crossfit gets a cold,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cold.</v>

2094
01:33:45.280 --> 01:33:46.113
<v Speaker 2>Hard killer like that would just it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems if you went in the water near </v>

2095
01:33:49.211 --> 01:33:51.340
<v Speaker 2>any crocodile had come and have a crack </v>
<v Speaker 2>at you.</v>

2096
01:33:52.090 --> 01:33:55.660
<v Speaker 2>If you went near any bar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>reckon about 50 percent of them,</v>

2097
01:33:55.720 --> 01:33:59.260
<v Speaker 2>40 percent of them might attack you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It might even be less than that where it</v>

2098
01:33:59.261 --> 01:34:00.094
<v Speaker 2>just seems like crocodiles so stuck in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Jurassic period that anything that </v>

2099
01:34:03.191 --> 01:34:05.410
<v Speaker 2>comes to that water's just going to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>chomped.</v>

2100
01:34:05.880 --> 01:34:09.340
<v Speaker 2>I tell you a quick little story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm in Arnhem land last year.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Just me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nigga from Arnhem.</v>

2110
01:34:35.920 --> 01:34:37.960
<v Speaker 2>Arnie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Arnie homeland.</v>

2111
01:34:37.990 --> 01:34:39.880
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a vast wilderness area,</v>

2112
01:34:40.160 --> 01:34:42.540
<v Speaker 2>or is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's God's land.</v>

2113
01:34:43.090 --> 01:34:43.923
<v Speaker 2>Beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

<v Speaker 2>He was hell.</v>

2115

<v Speaker 2>Absolute hell for any city slicker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is out there.</v>

2116
01:34:51.850 --> 01:34:53.600
<v Speaker 2>Ms Dot g dot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hello.</v>

2117
01:34:53.950 --> 01:34:55.650
<v Speaker 2>Got a picture is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2118
01:34:55.900 --> 01:34:58.910
<v Speaker 2>it is a spectacular and virtually </v>
<v Speaker 2>untouched.</v>

2119
01:34:59.780 --> 01:35:00.613
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the crazy thing about Australia </v>

2120
01:35:02.291 --> 01:35:03.124
<v Speaker 3>is the population that you guys have </v>
<v Speaker 3>essentially the population of Los </v>

2121
01:35:07.690 --> 01:35:10.480
<v Speaker 3>Angeles in a place as big as the </v>
<v Speaker 3>continental United States.</v>

2122
01:35:10.800 --> 01:35:12.430
<v Speaker 3>Think Cross for that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2123
01:35:12.431 --> 01:35:13.780
<v Speaker 3>it's nice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is nice.</v>

2124
01:35:13.870 --> 01:35:17.290
<v Speaker 3>Even when we went to like you go to a </v>
<v Speaker 3>nice city like Melbourne,</v>

2125
01:35:17.860 --> 01:35:18.910
<v Speaker 3>it's beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2126
01:35:18.970 --> 01:35:20.610
<v Speaker 3>That's like a little country town for </v>
<v Speaker 3>you guys.</v>

2127
01:35:20.670 --> 01:35:21.820
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All it is.</v>

2128
01:35:21.840 --> 01:35:22.720
<v Speaker 3>It's tiny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like boulder,</v>

2129
01:35:22.721 --> 01:35:24.580
<v Speaker 3>Colorado and we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get us out of here.</v>

2130
01:35:24.581 --> 01:35:26.470
<v Speaker 3>There's too much traffic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So uh,</v>

2131
01:35:26.710 --> 01:35:27.930
<v Speaker 3>you're in Arnhem land and what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>

2132
01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:33.000
<v Speaker 2>I mean Arnhem land and shoot these </v>
<v Speaker 2>massive big boar pig and it runs down.</v>

2133
01:35:33.791 --> 01:35:37.750
<v Speaker 2>So I shot it and it just ran down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just on the edge of the water and</v>

2134
01:35:37.751 --> 01:35:39.940
<v Speaker 2>it's fighting like it's seconds away </v>
<v Speaker 2>from dying.</v>

2135
01:35:40.570 --> 01:35:41.403
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I walk over there and as I walk over </v>

2136
01:35:44.261 --> 01:35:46.870
<v Speaker 2>there I sort of sit down and just give </v>
<v Speaker 2>the animal that's piece,</v>

2137
01:35:46.900 --> 01:35:47.733
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to give him an adrenaline </v>

2138
01:35:48.461 --> 01:35:50.890
<v Speaker 2>rush or anything like that because it </v>
<v Speaker 2>could take longer for it to die.</v>

2139
01:35:50.891 --> 01:35:55.891
<v Speaker 2>So I would just sit down quietly and </v>
<v Speaker 2>snap Massey big salt water crocodile,</v>

2140
01:35:56.621 --> 01:35:57.454
<v Speaker 2>just lunges out of the water and grabbed</v>
<v Speaker 2>these pig and stopped swimming out </v>

2141
01:36:00.670 --> 01:36:01.503
<v Speaker 2>across this river.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was seconds away from walking down </v>

2142
01:36:05.681 --> 01:36:08.710
<v Speaker 2>there and essentially dragging that pig </v>
<v Speaker 2>back</v>

2143
01:36:08.860 --> 01:36:09.693
<v Speaker 3>bank a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I get photos that crock was sitting </v>

2144
01:36:11.831 --> 01:36:13.380
<v Speaker 3>right there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like within seconds</v>

2145
01:36:13.520 --> 01:36:17.020
<v Speaker 2>is that crocodile was sitting on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>edge of the bank or just under the water</v>

2146
01:36:17.021 --> 01:36:20.080
<v Speaker 2>where it could grab that pig.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how quick it can happen.</v>

2147
01:36:20.081 --> 01:36:21.010
<v Speaker 2>People,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll walk down and go,</v>

2148
01:36:21.130 --> 01:36:21.963
<v Speaker 2>I'll just be quick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just going to wash my face really </v>

2149
01:36:23.441 --> 01:36:24.580
<v Speaker 2>quick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's always hot there.</v>

2150
01:36:24.790 --> 01:36:25.623
<v Speaker 2>So the most appealing thing in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Haiti's like you say water and it's </v>

2151
01:36:27.791 --> 01:36:28.624
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh well water go down there and just </v>

2152
01:36:29.981 --> 01:36:30.814
<v Speaker 2>kind of splash a bit of water on my face</v>
<v Speaker 2>and arms will be real quick gone and </v>

2153
01:36:33.881 --> 01:36:35.820
<v Speaker 2>they go for anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for anything.</v>

2154
01:36:35.830 --> 01:36:36.663
<v Speaker 2>So I don't have a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't have a reluctance to kill </v>

2155
01:36:38.051 --> 01:36:39.160
<v Speaker 2>people at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Definitely not.</v>

2156
01:36:39.490 --> 01:36:42.070
<v Speaker 2>And then um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's.</v>

2157
01:36:42.370 --> 01:36:44.920
<v Speaker 3>Oh Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this elephant by the nose.</v>

2158

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2162
01:36:55.540 --> 01:36:56.373
<v Speaker 3>It's the difference between the </v>
<v Speaker 3>crocodiles in Australia and those </v>

2163
01:36:58.121 --> 01:37:01.360
<v Speaker 3>fuckers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those fuckers are in Florida now.</v>

2164
01:37:02.080 --> 01:37:05.440
<v Speaker 3>Assholes in Florida.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Florida is just overrun with assholes.</v>

2165
01:37:06.040 --> 01:37:10.000
<v Speaker 3>Not Everybody's filed on day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you live in Florida and you're a nice</v>

2166
01:37:10.001 --> 01:37:12.100
<v Speaker 3>person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I appreciate Davao and legend.</v>

2167
01:37:12.310 --> 01:37:13.150
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm.</v>

2168
01:37:13.210 --> 01:37:17.050
<v Speaker 3>The crocodiles in the Nile.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Crocodiles have been in,</v>

2169
01:37:17.370 --> 01:37:18.203
<v Speaker 3>introduced to Florida.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Assholes have just released into the </v>

2170
01:37:21.101 --> 01:37:21.611
<v Speaker 3>everglades.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2171
01:37:21.611 --> 01:37:23.320
<v Speaker 3>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have a shoot to kill.</v>

2172
01:37:23.321 --> 01:37:24.490
<v Speaker 3>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm being sarcastic.</v>

2173
01:37:26.070 --> 01:37:29.440
<v Speaker 3>I was being sarcastic back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have a shoot on sight,</v>

2174
01:37:29.500 --> 01:37:30.333
<v Speaker 3>a order literally seeing Nile crocodile </v>
<v Speaker 3>supposed to kill it on site because </v>

2175
01:37:32.950 --> 01:37:33.783
<v Speaker 3>they're terrified of him developing a </v>
<v Speaker 3>sustainable population because the </v>

2176
01:37:36.641 --> 01:37:37.474
<v Speaker 3>crocodiles they have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the native crocodiles in Florida are </v>

2177
01:37:39.011 --> 01:37:40.870
<v Speaker 3>small,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're very aggressive.</v>

2178
01:37:41.020 --> 01:37:42.640
<v Speaker 3>They're way more aggressive than </v>
<v Speaker 3>alligators,</v>

2179
01:37:42.940 --> 01:37:43.773
<v Speaker 3>but they're smaller,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but now they have these fucking nial </v>

2180
01:37:46.121 --> 01:37:46.954
<v Speaker 3>crocs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We got just absolutely savage and just </v>

2181
01:37:48.670 --> 01:37:51.460
<v Speaker 3>swallow a person hall.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're talking about the everglades,</v>

2182
01:37:51.461 --> 01:37:53.470
<v Speaker 3>which is just overrun with things for </v>
<v Speaker 3>them to eat,</v>

2183
01:37:53.560 --> 01:37:56.970
<v Speaker 3>so there's a high of them achieving a </v>
<v Speaker 3>large size.</v>

2184
01:37:57.960 --> 01:38:00.150
<v Speaker 3>Where did they get that idea from?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The assholes.</v>

2185
01:38:00.540 --> 01:38:02.850
<v Speaker 3>People have them as pets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The same thing as pythons.</v>

2186
01:38:02.860 --> 01:38:03.693
<v Speaker 3>You know the python situation in Florida</v>
<v Speaker 3>that people have had to have them as </v>

2187
01:38:06.001 --> 01:38:07.560
<v Speaker 3>pets and then release them into the </v>
<v Speaker 3>wall.</v>

2188
01:38:07.940 --> 01:38:10.200
<v Speaker 3>Had I got there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it would get too big and they go,</v>

2189
01:38:10.210 --> 01:38:12.640
<v Speaker 3>fuck this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to let a kid,</v>

2190
01:38:13.560 --> 01:38:14.880
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you little crocodile,</v>

2191
01:38:15.240 --> 01:38:16.073
<v Speaker 3>go out and enjoy the wild and they think</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're doing the right thing by </v>

2192
01:38:18.990 --> 01:38:21.310
<v Speaker 3>releasing this thing into the swamps and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then,</v>

2193
01:38:21.680 --> 01:38:23.940
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have a breeding population now they</v>

2194
01:38:23.941 --> 01:38:25.620
<v Speaker 3>have a breeding population of Nile.</v>

2195
01:38:25.620 --> 01:38:30.340
<v Speaker 3>Crocodiles in fucking Florida sent back </v>
<v Speaker 3>to the Australian introduced species.</v>

2196
01:38:30.480 --> 01:38:32.610
<v Speaker 3>It like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it didn't stop it at foxes.</v>

2197
01:38:32.670 --> 01:38:33.960
<v Speaker 3>I kept making these mistakes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2198
01:38:33.961 --> 01:38:34.794
<v Speaker 3>the cane toads,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have a lot of trouble with the cane </v>

2199
01:38:35.761 --> 01:38:37.680
<v Speaker 3>toads now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Keen to cane toad.</v>

2200
01:38:37.830 --> 01:38:40.650
<v Speaker 3>What's a cane to virtually overtaken </v>
<v Speaker 3>Australia.</v>

2201
01:38:40.680 --> 01:38:41.513
<v Speaker 3>They're going to have their own </v>
<v Speaker 3>businesses and run for parliament and </v>

2202
01:38:43.221 --> 01:38:44.054
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eventually like towed or opening your </v>

2203
01:38:48.871 --> 01:38:50.480
<v Speaker 3>hands like a pizza.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Freaking oh,</v>

2204
01:38:50.670 --> 01:38:52.680
<v Speaker 3>not a pizza.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

2205
01:38:52.740 --> 01:38:54.570
<v Speaker 3>As a cane toad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>

2206
01:38:54.571 --> 01:38:56.520
<v Speaker 3>That thing's huge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bunny rabbit,</v>

2207
01:38:56.580 --> 01:38:59.550
<v Speaker 3>they got these glands on their back and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's got a poisonous toxin in it.</v>

2208
01:38:59.640 --> 01:39:00.211
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's great.</v>

2209
01:39:00.211 --> 01:39:03.960
<v Speaker 3>And so our bird wildlife are snakes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hate snakes.</v>

2210
01:39:04.350 --> 01:39:06.000
<v Speaker 3>Snakes are protected in Australia by the</v>
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>

2211
01:39:06.001 --> 01:39:06.834
<v Speaker 3>You can't just go and kill the snake </v>
<v Speaker 3>when you want and they've still got </v>

2212
01:39:09.481 --> 01:39:11.300
<v Speaker 3>their place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're 100 percent snakes and got their</v>

2213
01:39:11.310 --> 01:39:12.143
<v Speaker 3>place in Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the snakes atum and these poisonous </v>

2214
01:39:14.641 --> 01:39:15.474
<v Speaker 3>toxins will kill the snakes that'll kill</v>
<v Speaker 3>that bird life that they had just </v>

2215
01:39:19.291 --> 01:39:21.780
<v Speaker 3>horrific Jesus kroger the size,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these things,</v>

2216
01:39:21.930 --> 01:39:22.763
<v Speaker 3>so why don't quote me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm pretty sure they brought him in </v>

2217
01:39:25.911 --> 01:39:26.744
<v Speaker 3>to fight off a cane beetle that was </v>
<v Speaker 3>eating now cane crops and there's that </v>

2218
01:39:30.511 --> 01:39:32.860
<v Speaker 3>many other bugs in that that the cane </v>
<v Speaker 3>toad would have been like,</v>

2219
01:39:33.110 --> 01:39:34.170
<v Speaker 3>I'll just eat what I want.</v>

2220
01:39:34.200 --> 01:39:36.960
<v Speaker 3>What a stupid thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can't we learn?</v>

2221
01:39:36.990 --> 01:39:38.160
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people are very,</v>

2222
01:39:38.520 --> 01:39:43.050
<v Speaker 3>very infant tile with the perspective on</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ecosystem,</v>

2223
01:39:43.051 --> 01:39:46.350
<v Speaker 3>like the idea that you could just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh well we've got a little problem here.</v>

2224
01:39:46.351 --> 01:39:47.760
<v Speaker 3>I got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well there's a little opening.</v>

2225
01:39:47.761 --> 01:39:48.594
<v Speaker 3>I'll stick up a slot in there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just shove a Predator in there and I'll </v>

2226
01:39:51.271 --> 01:39:55.060
<v Speaker 3>fill that opening like they didn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>consider all the other animals that this</v>

2227
01:39:55.070 --> 01:39:55.903
<v Speaker 3>thing would eat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If they want to do something and what </v>

2228
01:39:57.391 --> 01:40:00.120
<v Speaker 3>they should do instead of introduced and</v>
<v Speaker 3>shit like this.</v>

2229
01:40:00.130 --> 01:40:02.060
<v Speaker 3>See this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>check your load for a cane.</v>

2230
01:40:02.550 --> 01:40:03.383
<v Speaker 3>Toads,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cane toads are great stowaways and can </v>

2231
01:40:07.531 --> 01:40:08.364
<v Speaker 3>be easily transported and your goods and</v>
<v Speaker 3>luggage when you were packing up to </v>

2232
01:40:11.191 --> 01:40:13.800
<v Speaker 3>leave from an area where cane toads are </v>
<v Speaker 3>present,</v>

2233
01:40:14.070 --> 01:40:16.320
<v Speaker 3>it is important to thoroughly check </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

2234
01:40:16.410 --> 01:40:19.230
<v Speaker 3>Were that accidentally carrying a cane </v>
<v Speaker 3>toad?</v>

2235
01:40:20.160 --> 01:40:22.510
<v Speaker 3>They're not a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tasmanian Tiger?</v>

2236
01:40:22.850 --> 01:40:23.683
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the Tasmanian talk like extinct </v>

2237
01:40:25.651 --> 01:40:28.230
<v Speaker 3>narrow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they got the DNA from one guy,</v>

2238
01:40:28.250 --> 01:40:30.660
<v Speaker 3>ray and juice something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's do it.</v>

2239
01:40:30.900 --> 01:40:33.360
<v Speaker 3>Are they going to reintroduce one that I</v>
<v Speaker 3>like white,</v>

2240
01:40:33.361 --> 01:40:36.630
<v Speaker 3>but they should now if they wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 3>introduce that,</v>

2241
01:40:36.660 --> 01:40:37.493
<v Speaker 3>they wanted to take the DNA from a </v>
<v Speaker 3>Tasmanian Tiger and reintroduce it when </v>

2242
01:40:40.591 --> 01:40:45.120
<v Speaker 3>they have to have something that was </v>
<v Speaker 3>like a similar animal in and reintroduce</v>

2243
01:40:45.121 --> 01:40:45.954
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Possibly.</v>

2244
01:40:46.670 --> 01:40:49.080
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I got that from Jurassic Park.</v>

2245
01:40:49.590 --> 01:40:52.320
<v Speaker 3>Probably pretty true though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's how they do it.</v>

2246
01:40:52.530 --> 01:40:53.363
<v Speaker 3>Well then in that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what they said they were going to do </v>

2247
01:40:54.281 --> 01:40:55.114
<v Speaker 3>with the woolly mammoth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like there was this Russian scientists </v>

2248
01:40:56.920 --> 01:41:00.490
<v Speaker 3>that we're thinking about reintroducing </v>
<v Speaker 3>the wooly mammoth and they were going to</v>

2249
01:41:00.491 --> 01:41:03.610
<v Speaker 3>use the DNA from a woolly mammoth from </v>
<v Speaker 3>some,</v>

2250
01:41:03.670 --> 01:41:05.860
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fossilized something or another,</v>

2251
01:41:05.861 --> 01:41:09.550
<v Speaker 3>and they were going to combine it with </v>
<v Speaker 3>the DNA from a regular elephant.</v>

2252
01:41:09.670 --> 01:41:12.030
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that'd be interesting.</v>

2253
01:41:12.700 --> 01:41:14.650
<v Speaker 3>I think in some cases like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2254
01:41:14.651 --> 01:41:17.260
<v Speaker 3>not trying to be God or anything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that should happen.</v>

2255
01:41:17.261 --> 01:41:18.210
<v Speaker 3>That's a good thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2256
01:41:18.900 --> 01:41:22.810
<v Speaker 3>Togare I think it's only extinct because</v>
<v Speaker 3>of human interactions.</v>

2257
01:41:22.840 --> 01:41:26.200
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So out of night,</v>

2258
01:41:26.260 --> 01:41:28.750
<v Speaker 3>I don't know either,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but 90 percent of everything is extinct.</v>

2259
01:41:29.020 --> 01:41:30.610
<v Speaker 3>Ninety percent of everything that's ever</v>
<v Speaker 3>lived.</v>

2260
01:41:30.880 --> 01:41:32.020
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where do you draw the line?</v>

2261
01:41:32.021 --> 01:41:33.550
<v Speaker 3>Do we bring back dinosaurs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2262
01:41:33.560 --> 01:41:35.440
<v Speaker 3>when do we draw the line?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That'd be good hunting.</v>

2263
01:41:35.550 --> 01:41:36.750
<v Speaker 3>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tigger impact.</v>

2264
01:41:36.760 --> 01:41:39.810
<v Speaker 3>Big Foot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Would you want the t rex?</v>

2265
01:41:40.150 --> 01:41:41.560
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if there was enough of them,</v>

2266
01:41:41.561 --> 01:41:42.394
<v Speaker 3>what if they say is good?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Imagine that because alligators tastes </v>

2267
01:41:43.901 --> 01:41:44.401
<v Speaker 3>good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2268
01:41:44.401 --> 01:41:45.160
<v Speaker 3>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2269
01:41:45.160 --> 01:41:46.360
<v Speaker 3>I've eaten one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

2270
01:41:46.660 --> 01:41:48.460
<v Speaker 3>John Dudley kills them all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He eats him.</v>

2271
01:41:48.490 --> 01:41:49.323

<v Speaker 3>please.</v>

2283
01:42:20.770 --> 01:42:22.990
<v Speaker 3>This,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the city in the northern territory,</v>

2284
01:42:22.991 --> 01:42:23.824
<v Speaker 3>which is all part of honestly and ne is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is Darwin City and the river runs right </v>

2285
01:42:29.381 --> 01:42:31.090
<v Speaker 3>into the city and there's crocodiles </v>
<v Speaker 3>right in there.</v>

2286
01:42:31.420 --> 01:42:34.590
<v Speaker 3>So guys will go out clubbing or you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

2287
01:42:34.600 --> 01:42:35.433
<v Speaker 3>drink and get drunk and think it's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>good idea to jump in the river for a </v>

2288
01:42:37.361 --> 01:42:40.060
<v Speaker 3>swim and Yahoo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm now getting snatched.</v>

2289
01:42:40.480 --> 01:42:41.313
<v Speaker 3>So they catch oles crocodiles and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>release him like miles and miles away </v>

2290
01:42:47.201 --> 01:42:49.300
<v Speaker 3>and these things come straight back into</v>
<v Speaker 3>the science spot.</v>

2291
01:42:49.300 --> 01:42:50.133
<v Speaker 3>And they liked the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is what I'm hearing about these </v>

2292
01:42:50.891 --> 01:42:51.724
<v Speaker 3>bears,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2293
01:42:51.990 --> 01:42:55.590
<v Speaker 3>Like catch sleeves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>problem bears and they release them were</v>

2294
01:42:55.630 --> 01:42:56.463
<v Speaker 3>near on hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Unfortunately they catch these problem </v>

2295
01:42:58.451 --> 01:42:59.284
<v Speaker 3>based and that release them multiply and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then a week later they show back up to </v>

2296
01:43:03.041 --> 01:43:04.650
<v Speaker 3>the same destination.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2297
01:43:04.710 --> 01:43:06.340
<v Speaker 3>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They know how to get back.</v>

2298
01:43:06.410 --> 01:43:07.243
<v Speaker 3>They have some sort of internal compass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the things about saltwater </v>

2299
01:43:09.790 --> 01:43:11.080
<v Speaker 3>crocodiles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so terrifying.</v>

2300
01:43:11.081 --> 01:43:11.914
<v Speaker 3>As a friend of mine was telling me that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they were on some sort of a boat and </v>

2301
01:43:14.321 --> 01:43:16.840
<v Speaker 3>they were like a deep out into the </v>
<v Speaker 3>ocean,</v>

2302
01:43:16.841 --> 01:43:20.020
<v Speaker 3>miles out and they saw saltwater </v>
<v Speaker 3>crocodile swimming out there.</v>

2303
01:43:20.560 --> 01:43:22.500
<v Speaker 3>And what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how,</v>

2304
01:43:22.620 --> 01:43:23.453
<v Speaker 3>how far?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said yeah,</v>

2305
01:43:23.530 --> 01:43:24.363
<v Speaker 3>I think he said he was something like </v>
<v Speaker 3>three to five miles away from shore and </v>

2306
01:43:27.130 --> 01:43:27.963
<v Speaker 3>it's fucking crocodiles just out there </v>
<v Speaker 3>swimming by z probably could have </v>

2307
01:43:31.500 --> 01:43:34.030
<v Speaker 3>probably gotten a great watch off or </v>
<v Speaker 3>some shit.</v>

2308
01:43:34.420 --> 01:43:37.650
<v Speaker 3>Fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a goddamn dinosaur hat.</v>

2309
01:43:37.690 --> 01:43:38.690
<v Speaker 3>Look at that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2310
01:43:38.740 --> 01:43:40.450
<v Speaker 3>that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When came,</v>

2311
01:43:40.451 --> 01:43:41.284
<v Speaker 3>came out and were up in Arnhem land and </v>
<v Speaker 3>I was telling him about all the </v>

2312
01:43:44.021 --> 01:43:45.160
<v Speaker 3>dangerous shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2313
01:43:45.161 --> 01:43:46.980
<v Speaker 3>like a crocodile will,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2314
01:43:46.990 --> 01:43:49.750
<v Speaker 3>there's crocodiles in any bit of water </v>
<v Speaker 3>here you wouldn't even know and there'll</v>

2315
01:43:49.751 --> 01:43:51.680
<v Speaker 3>be a crocodile in there and</v>

2316
01:43:52.010 --> 01:43:54.440
<v Speaker 2>how buffalo charge you're in charge </v>
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>

2317
01:43:54.441 --> 01:43:55.274
<v Speaker 2>And I told him about all the poisoners </v>
<v Speaker 2>bushes and everything and at the end of </v>

2318
01:43:58.401 --> 01:44:01.420
<v Speaker 2>one day we got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we got back with like half our light and</v>

2319
01:44:01.421 --> 01:44:02.254
<v Speaker 2>because I didn't pack any food in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we had to catch fish every day or try </v>

2320
01:44:04.671 --> 01:44:05.504
<v Speaker 2>and shoot some shoots eight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we got back half an hour early one </v>

2321
01:44:08.751 --> 01:44:10.670
<v Speaker 2>afternoon and we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll go for a quick fish,</v>

2322
01:44:10.830 --> 01:44:12.590
<v Speaker 2>we're going to catch some fish in and </v>
<v Speaker 2>we've got to get some,</v>

2323
01:44:12.740 --> 01:44:17.300
<v Speaker 2>some food into us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we walk out and it's stinking hot.</v>

2324
01:44:17.301 --> 01:44:18.134
<v Speaker 2>It's like 56 degrees Celsius.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'd like sweating it out is like </v>

2325
01:44:23.860 --> 01:44:27.200
<v Speaker 2>1:10.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's probably even a bit higher.</v>

2326
01:44:27.560 --> 01:44:29.120
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hot.</v>

2327
01:44:29.780 --> 01:44:32.690
<v Speaker 2>And unlike how we might be able to swim </v>
<v Speaker 2>in one of the rock pools,</v>

2328
01:44:32.691 --> 01:44:35.050
<v Speaker 2>you don't want to swim out in the ocean </v>
<v Speaker 2>because one of them crocs is gonna.</v>

2329
01:44:35.060 --> 01:44:40.060
<v Speaker 2>Grab a 50 slash 56.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

01:44:40.400 --> 01:44:42.130
<v Speaker 2>Jack it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Baby 50.</v>

2331

2332
01:44:45.280 --> 01:44:48.980
<v Speaker 2>One hundred and 32 degrees.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Temperature drink and buffalo peers.</v>

2333
01:44:49.010 --> 01:44:49.843
<v Speaker 2>Because you had to keep hydrated or die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does it feel like to be out in 132 </v>

2334
01:44:53.751 --> 01:44:55.370
<v Speaker 2>degree temperature?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get used to it.</v>

2335
01:44:55.820 --> 01:44:57.700
<v Speaker 2>How the fuck do you get used to them?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

2336
01:44:58.110 --> 01:44:58.943
<v Speaker 2>it's like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All my guys are working with working </v>

2337
01:45:00.540 --> 01:45:02.730
<v Speaker 2>that temperature or summer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could slip that cooking.</v>

2338
01:45:02.780 --> 01:45:06.000
<v Speaker 2>I'm at 115 degrees.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those birds dying around us.</v>

2339
01:45:06.920 --> 01:45:08.930
<v Speaker 2>There's a little video where I've got </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2340
01:45:08.990 --> 01:45:11.410
<v Speaker 2>it might be a frogmouth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our attorney our.</v>

2341
01:45:11.810 --> 01:45:14.150
<v Speaker 2>And it's just that heart that it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's on the grant,</v>

<v Speaker 2>it's out,</v>

2343
01:45:15.280 --> 01:45:17.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it hasn't had obviously a bit of</v>

2344
01:45:17.061 --> 01:45:17.894
<v Speaker 2>hto and that day and anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we're going out and there's a rock </v>

2345
01:45:21.141 --> 01:45:21.380
<v Speaker 2>pool.</v>

2346
01:45:21.380 --> 01:45:21.821
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2347
01:45:21.821 --> 01:45:24.570
<v Speaker 2>we'll be safe to swim in that rock pool,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the tide had gone out.</v>

2348
01:45:24.571 --> 01:45:26.290
<v Speaker 2>We've got big tires like seven made a </v>
<v Speaker 2>tired,</v>

2349
01:45:26.291 --> 01:45:27.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're come in and out every day,</v>

2350
01:45:28.430 --> 01:45:31.520
<v Speaker 2>and the todd had been in and when had </v>
<v Speaker 2>gone out to the left,</v>

2351
01:45:31.610 --> 01:45:34.340
<v Speaker 2>a bunch of box jellyfish in that little </v>
<v Speaker 2>pool.</v>

2352
01:45:35.210 --> 01:45:36.043
<v Speaker 2>Then the ocean itself where we'll </v>
<v Speaker 2>fishing in or you wouldn't be able to </v>

2353
01:45:38.361 --> 01:45:41.880
<v Speaker 2>dip your hand in the water getting stung</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the box jellyfish box.</v>

2354
01:45:41.910 --> 01:45:43.010
<v Speaker 2>Jellyfish will kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2355
01:45:43.070 --> 01:45:44.720
<v Speaker 2>you're dead dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was a,</v>

2356
01:45:44.780 --> 01:45:45.613
<v Speaker 2>that was a four and a half hour chopper </v>
<v Speaker 2>flight out to get there because we did </v>

2357
01:45:48.741 --> 01:45:50.840
<v Speaker 2>it in the wet season.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You couldn't drive any of the roads.</v>

2358
01:45:51.410 --> 01:45:53.510
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had to hire a helicopter to get us out</v>

2359
01:45:53.511 --> 01:45:54.344
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it would have been four and a half </v>

2360
01:45:55.401 --> 01:45:56.234
<v Speaker 2>hours for a hell of a cop to come in and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then four and a half hours back to the </v>

2361
01:45:58.791 --> 01:45:59.624
<v Speaker 2>hospital.</v>

2362
01:45:59.630 --> 01:46:02.060
<v Speaker 2>You're dead in that time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're dead in the first hour.</v>

<v Speaker 2>and that sort of country.</v>

2365
01:46:07.820 --> 01:46:10.370
<v Speaker 2>So box jellyfish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do they look like?</v>

2366
01:46:10.390 --> 01:46:12.920
<v Speaker 2>They're the one that nearly clear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>instantly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's the one thing I didn't tell </v>

2369

2406
01:47:57.640 --> 01:48:02.030
<v Speaker 3>Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to say it anyway.</v>

2407
01:48:02.040 --> 01:48:03.840
<v Speaker 3>When you come out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't take any of those and there's</v>

2408
01:48:03.841 --> 01:48:05.640
<v Speaker 3>so many things that killed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll take him in the ocean.</v>

2409
01:48:05.710 --> 01:48:09.960
<v Speaker 3>Then the things that kill you because </v>
<v Speaker 3>they want us to live in Australia.</v>

2410
01:48:10.080 --> 01:48:10.913
<v Speaker 3>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I always think about work </v>

2411
01:48:11.911 --> 01:48:15.920
<v Speaker 3>because it's so freaking hot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so desolate that it's like,</v>

2412
01:48:15.921 --> 01:48:18.420
<v Speaker 3>it just wasn't designed for people is </v>
<v Speaker 3>part of the earth.</v>

2413
01:48:18.750 --> 01:48:19.730
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>

2414
01:48:20.070 --> 01:48:21.240
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people didn't live then,</v>

2415
01:48:21.270 --> 01:48:22.103
<v Speaker 3>so didn't balance it out at some of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>oldest earth on earth work that people </v>

2416
01:48:26.491 --> 01:48:31.140
<v Speaker 3>didn't live their western dummies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like uni white people.</v>

2417
01:48:31.140 --> 01:48:33.510
<v Speaker 3>We definitely didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The indigenous people that lived there,</v>

2418
01:48:33.511 --> 01:48:36.060
<v Speaker 3>I did that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I lived on the mainland and um,</v>

2419
01:48:36.310 --> 01:48:39.300
<v Speaker 3>there's actually some really interesting</v>
<v Speaker 3>areas out there.</v>

2420
01:48:39.301 --> 01:48:40.134
<v Speaker 3>It's called the dampier archipelago in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Pilbara region of Western Australia </v>

2421
01:48:44.010 --> 01:48:44.843
<v Speaker 3>and there's over 70,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>a rock in the area that I still don't </v>

2422
01:48:49.471 --> 01:48:50.610
<v Speaker 3>know this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you can solve it,</v>

2423
01:48:50.611 --> 01:48:54.300
<v Speaker 3>but 70,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>rockets in that area.</v>

2424
01:48:54.640 --> 01:48:56.370
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kangaroos,</v>

2425
01:48:56.371 --> 01:48:59.430
<v Speaker 3>sea turtles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>creatures that don't even exist anymore.</v>

2426
01:48:59.431 --> 01:49:00.480
<v Speaker 3>When you look at the picture,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

2427
01:49:00.690 --> 01:49:02.490
<v Speaker 3>was that a real animal?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That drawer and all that.</v>

2428
01:49:02.491 --> 01:49:03.140
<v Speaker 3>I just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>

2429
01:49:03.140 --> 01:49:03.973
<v Speaker 3>I just got to fuck her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so they don't even know whether or </v>

2430
01:49:05.311 --> 01:49:07.550
<v Speaker 3>not it was a real thing because it </v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't exist anymore.</v>

2431
01:49:07.551 --> 01:49:09.540
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't exist anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

2432
01:49:09.590 --> 01:49:10.560
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2433
01:49:10.561 --> 01:49:12.030
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the kangaroo thing,</v>

2434
01:49:12.060 --> 01:49:13.830
<v Speaker 3>we were talking about that before the </v>
<v Speaker 3>podcast,</v>

2435
01:49:13.840 --> 01:49:15.720
<v Speaker 3>we said we're going to show this video.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2436
01:49:15.960 --> 01:49:19.200
<v Speaker 3>I did not know the Kangaroos were </v>
<v Speaker 3>protected.</v>

2437
01:49:19.230 --> 01:49:21.240
<v Speaker 3>Like you can't just shoot kangaroos over</v>
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

2438
01:49:21.300 --> 01:49:23.640
<v Speaker 3>all about naive animals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't have any event.</v>

2439
01:49:23.641 --> 01:49:26.760
<v Speaker 3>90 animals in Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything we can hunt and there's 27 or</v>

2440
01:49:26.761 --> 01:49:31.350
<v Speaker 3>28 spaces are old introduced.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're an invasive species,</v>

2441
01:49:31.380 --> 01:49:34.320
<v Speaker 3>like a feral pest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why we're allowed to hunt them.</v>

2442
01:49:34.740 --> 01:49:39.420
<v Speaker 3>It's not like the American system where </v>
<v Speaker 3>your hunting unite is lucky at what tile</v>

2443
01:49:39.421 --> 01:49:40.254
<v Speaker 3>and oak and everything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's why we don't have a tag </v>

2444
01:49:42.661 --> 01:49:43.381
<v Speaker 3>season.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2445
01:49:43.381 --> 01:49:44.760
<v Speaker 3>we don't have any,</v>
<v Speaker 3>any,</v>

2446
01:49:45.030 --> 01:49:45.863
<v Speaker 3>any seasons at all in New South Wales.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've just introduced this season in </v>

2447
01:49:49.511 --> 01:49:54.511
<v Speaker 3>the last couple of years and there's one</v>
<v Speaker 3>species of d in Victoria,</v>

2448
01:49:57.040 --> 01:49:59.610
<v Speaker 3>the lower part of Australia where you </v>
<v Speaker 3>need to tag for.</v>

2449
01:49:59.660 --> 01:50:02.110
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All those other species you don't need a</v>

2450
01:50:02.111 --> 01:50:03.650
<v Speaker 3>tag for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's no season.</v>

2451
01:50:03.670 --> 01:50:06.760
<v Speaker 3>What species have a healthy body?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You need to type for those.</v>

2452
01:50:06.880 --> 01:50:07.713
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's not a bunch of them and they're </v>

2453
01:50:08.531 --> 01:50:09.340
<v Speaker 3>trying to manage them.</v>

2454
01:50:09.340 --> 01:50:10.420
<v Speaker 3>It's really good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What they're doing,</v>

2455
01:50:10.421 --> 01:50:12.790
<v Speaker 3>they're doing a good job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mm hmm.</v>

2456
01:50:12.970 --> 01:50:13.803
<v Speaker 3>So the kangaroo thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had no idea that the numbers of </v>

2457
01:50:17.411 --> 01:50:20.770
<v Speaker 3>Kangaroos were as high as they are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you were telling me about this.</v>

2458
01:50:20.780 --> 01:50:21.613
<v Speaker 3>Looks like a kangaroo plague.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then Jamie pull the video up and </v>

2459
01:50:23.800 --> 01:50:28.780
<v Speaker 3>this is fucking insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just Google kangaroo plague Australia.</v>

2460
01:50:29.050 --> 01:50:32.380
<v Speaker 3>And what you see is something from a </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking horror movie.</v>

2461
01:50:32.710 --> 01:50:33.543
<v Speaker 3>It looks like thousands of Kangaroos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I have no idea how many of their </v>

2462
01:50:36.660 --> 01:50:38.590
<v Speaker 3>head they're just running across this </v>
<v Speaker 3>field.</v>

2463
01:50:38.591 --> 01:50:40.480
<v Speaker 3>Like ants.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I bet you have that.</v>

2464
01:50:40.481 --> 01:50:42.160
<v Speaker 3>Analysts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't cheeses.</v>

2465
01:50:42.320 --> 01:50:45.790
<v Speaker 3>I mean completely insane when you look </v>
<v Speaker 3>at that video.</v>

2466
01:50:45.791 --> 01:50:47.770
<v Speaker 3>I have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2467
01:50:47.771 --> 01:50:51.670
<v Speaker 3>So fuck a sign.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The sign people that are lucky,</v>

2468
01:50:51.671 --> 01:50:53.530
<v Speaker 3>you can't call the Kangaroos,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2469
01:50:53.531 --> 01:50:55.780
<v Speaker 3>you can't hunt the Kangaroos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't shoot the Kangaroos.</v>

2470
01:50:56.140 --> 01:50:58.450
<v Speaker 3>Kangaroos are a deer species,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2471
01:50:59.290 --> 01:51:02.040
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they're like a marsupial.</v>

2472
01:51:02.041 --> 01:51:04.330
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't have a near.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2473
01:51:04.690 --> 01:51:07.330
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they even taste like deer.</v>

2474
01:51:07.800 --> 01:51:09.700
<v Speaker 3>They taste good too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The really rich red.</v>

2475
01:51:09.701 --> 01:51:11.230
<v Speaker 3>Meat's super,</v>
<v Speaker 3>super lean.</v>

2476
01:51:11.540 --> 01:51:14.260
<v Speaker 3>A lot of the lot of the body builders </v>
<v Speaker 3>and stuff like that.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Love kangaroo meat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When did kangaroo start getting joked?</v>

2478
01:51:17.050 --> 01:51:19.630

<v Speaker 3>They always had big muscles.</v>

2479
01:51:19.690 --> 01:51:20.523
<v Speaker 3>They've always had big muscle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We didn't see that in America until </v>

2480
01:51:22.040 --> 01:51:23.290
<v Speaker 3>recently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not really.</v>

2481
01:51:23.360 --> 01:51:27.670
<v Speaker 3>Internet over the last few years has </v>
<v Speaker 3>showed us a choking each other.</v>

<v Speaker 3>The red ones are the biggest ones,</v>

2492
01:51:48.401 --> 01:51:48.580

<v Speaker 3>Look real man does not look real bitch.</v>

<v Speaker 3>You and arm wrestle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck that man.</v>

2499
01:52:04.690 --> 01:52:06.730
<v Speaker 3>So that was what would happen with </v>
<v Speaker 3>Eddie.</v>

2500
01:52:06.790 --> 01:52:07.623
<v Speaker 3>He got out of the car for some reason </v>
<v Speaker 3>and he saw this kangaroo and he thought </v>

2501
01:52:12.191 --> 01:52:15.550
<v Speaker 3>it was a statue because it was so big.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He thought it was.</v>

2502
01:52:15.610 --> 01:52:17.940
<v Speaker 3>He thought it wasn't really so he was </v>
<v Speaker 3>like seven feet tall.</v>

2503
01:52:17.941 --> 01:52:19.990
<v Speaker 3>It's like there's no fucking way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a real kangaroo.</v>

2504
01:52:20.230 --> 01:52:21.063
<v Speaker 3>He literally thought it was a statute </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it was sitting there and his </v>

2505
01:52:23.291 --> 01:52:27.730
<v Speaker 3>friend started screaming,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get back fucking car,</v>

2506
01:52:27.820 --> 01:52:29.350
<v Speaker 3>and the thing turns around and looks at </v>
<v Speaker 3>him,</v>

2507
01:52:29.560 --> 01:52:30.393
<v Speaker 3>and then he realized that this giant </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing in front of them was an actual </v>

2508
01:52:32.771 --> 01:52:34.780
<v Speaker 3>kangaroo and apparently they're very </v>
<v Speaker 3>aggressive.</v>

2509
01:52:35.050 --> 01:52:36.750
<v Speaker 3>They're calling as a life feel </v>
<v Speaker 3>threatened now.</v>

2510
01:52:37.690 --> 01:52:40.300
<v Speaker 3>They'll kick your stomach out because </v>
<v Speaker 3>what they do is they latch onto you.</v>

2511
01:52:40.301 --> 01:52:42.190
<v Speaker 3>If they close.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've actually got a real big claw.</v>

2512
01:52:42.310 --> 01:52:44.690
<v Speaker 3>They got clothes like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2513
01:52:45.050 --> 01:52:45.883
<v Speaker 3>and then they balance their cell phone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their tile and like kick with both legs </v>

2514
01:52:48.411 --> 01:52:53.411
<v Speaker 3>and they got like a single toe nail </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's like that thing that has legs and</v>

2515
01:52:55.130 --> 01:52:55.963
<v Speaker 3>that does not look real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the balance that way on their back </v>

2516
01:52:59.940 --> 01:53:00.773
<v Speaker 3>tails and credible out balancing their </v>
<v Speaker 3>Bechtel's now kick with both their legs </v>

2517
01:53:04.311 --> 01:53:07.220
<v Speaker 3>and then look how he's like balancing </v>
<v Speaker 3>himself.</v>

2518

<v Speaker 3>with a kangaroo,</v>

2531
01:53:54.590 --> 01:53:56.300

<v Speaker 3>these two kangaroos are fighting in like</v>
<v Speaker 3>a suburban neighborhood and they're in a</v>

2551
01:54:46.461 --> 01:54:49.370
<v Speaker 3>street and one kangaroo Canberra.</v>

2552
01:54:49.400 --> 01:54:51.620
<v Speaker 3>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what we call like a vice grip clamp.</v>

2553
01:54:51.950 --> 01:54:54.710
<v Speaker 3>In jujitsu you would use or wrestling,</v>

<v Speaker 3>like this with one arm.</v>

2555
01:54:57.980 --> 01:55:00.110
<v Speaker 3>And the other arm comes down and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>clamped down like this,</v>

2556
01:55:00.111 --> 01:55:03.020
<v Speaker 3>this is it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he fucking chokes him to sleep.</v>

<v Speaker 3>This has got to be Canberra for see if </v>
<v Speaker 3>he could fight this.</v>

2558
01:55:05.330 --> 01:55:08.510

<v Speaker 3>each other's asses,</v>

2559
01:55:09.140 --> 01:55:11.870
<v Speaker 3>but they're in a like a regular </v>
<v Speaker 3>neighborhood fucking each other up.</v>

01:55:30.170 --> 01:55:32.840
<v Speaker 3>Oh look at that move though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like how they balance on that.</v>

2566
01:55:32.841 --> 01:55:34.100

<v Speaker 3>Checkouts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kangaroos,</v>

2571
01:55:48.900 --> 01:55:50.610

<v Speaker 3>People learn from Kangaroos.</v>

2572
01:55:50.700 --> 01:55:52.040
<v Speaker 3>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe.</v>

2573
01:55:52.041 --> 01:55:55.020
<v Speaker 3>Maybe someone actually saw in school to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Canberra.</v>

2574
01:55:55.320 --> 01:55:56.153
<v Speaker 3>I bet people didn't know that you could </v>
<v Speaker 3>choke people out until they saw someone </v>

2575
01:55:58.021 --> 01:55:58.854
<v Speaker 3>do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2576
01:55:58.890 --> 01:55:59.723
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

2578
01:56:00.940 --> 01:56:05.940
<v Speaker 3>they start going at it and one kangaroo </v>
<v Speaker 3>is cv could find out where he does it.</v>

2579
01:56:07.960 --> 01:56:08.793
<v Speaker 3>He gets a front headlock,</v>
<v Speaker 3>see the one kangaroos kind of being a </v>

2580
01:56:13.621 --> 01:56:16.410
<v Speaker 3>pitcher.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So here it is.</v>

2581
01:56:16.630 --> 01:56:18.990
<v Speaker 3>She's got the clamp,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll get it clamped.</v>

2582
01:56:19.530 --> 01:56:20.363
<v Speaker 3>He gets a hold of the neck and he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>bending his neck and a really funny way </v>

2583
01:56:23.251 --> 01:56:25.470
<v Speaker 3>and he traps the head up against his </v>
<v Speaker 3>chest.</v>

2584
01:56:25.471 --> 01:56:27.180
<v Speaker 3>I mean this is like a Japanese necktie </v>
<v Speaker 3>right here.</v>

2585
01:56:27.630 --> 01:56:30.300
<v Speaker 3>And he grabs a hold of it and he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>clamping down on it.</v>

2586
01:56:30.490 --> 01:56:31.770
<v Speaker 3>It's not even like he's paying </v>
<v Speaker 3>attention.</v>

2587
01:56:31.771 --> 01:56:35.310
<v Speaker 3>It was like he's looking for girls,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey ladies got this shit.</v>

2588
01:56:35.650 --> 01:56:38.140
<v Speaker 3>Looting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if he's done that before.</v>

2589
01:56:38.141 --> 01:56:40.690
<v Speaker 3>But that's his baby.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he,</v>

2590
01:56:40.740 --> 01:56:41.573
<v Speaker 3>he clamps down on any holds it in place </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the kangaroo fights for a little </v>

2591
01:56:44.431 --> 01:56:47.380
<v Speaker 3>while and then Bam passes out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's awesome.</v>

2592
01:56:48.340 --> 01:56:53.340
<v Speaker 3>And is a bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What a bizarre bodied animal.</v>

<v Speaker 3>It's been so used to seeing these </v>

2594
01:56:58.381 --> 01:57:01.400
<v Speaker 3>animals that same way to us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>these things are on two legs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2597

<v Speaker 3>Not.</v>

2598

<v Speaker 3>But have you ever seen a platypus?</v>

2601
01:57:16.520 --> 01:57:17.353
<v Speaker 3>Not In real life.</v>

2603
01:57:21.031 --> 01:57:21.864
<v Speaker 3>Platypus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I used to be in the creeks and the </v>

2604
01:57:22.981 --> 01:57:23.820
<v Speaker 3>rivers around home.</v>

2605
01:57:24.300 --> 01:57:25.133
<v Speaker 3>They were just so weird to look at and </v>
<v Speaker 3>let the kid know and when I stopped </v>

2606
01:57:28.081 --> 01:57:30.450
<v Speaker 3>thinking about as species,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the wombat,</v>

<v Speaker 3>They're all over the farm.</v>

2608
01:57:34.051 --> 01:57:35.520
<v Speaker 3>You'll see them everywhere when you come</v>

<v Speaker 3>Awesome animal.</v>

2637
01:58:51.670 --> 01:58:53.520

<v Speaker 3>A little thing.</v>

2638
01:58:53.650 --> 01:58:55.090
<v Speaker 3>That was one on the road.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Digging the Alvin.</v>

2639
01:58:55.100 --> 01:58:59.430
<v Speaker 3>I owe a lot of the month now because </v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been away for so long and a main.</v>

2640
01:58:59.440 --> 01:59:00.700
<v Speaker 3>The kids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whenever we see them on the ride,</v>

2641
01:59:00.701 --> 01:59:03.650
<v Speaker 3>we will move them off the road and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>kids got out and,</v>

2642
01:59:03.820 --> 01:59:06.910
<v Speaker 3>and you can actually hold ice box is </v>
<v Speaker 3>super sharp,</v>

2643
01:59:06.911 --> 01:59:10.210
<v Speaker 3>but you can actually touch them because </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's taken up so much room on your hand,</v>

2644
01:59:10.211 --> 01:59:10.781
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2645
01:59:10.781 --> 01:59:13.090
<v Speaker 3>there's 100 spots and they chain you can</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually touch them.</v>

2646
01:59:13.780 --> 01:59:14.760
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

2647
01:59:14.880 --> 01:59:17.050
<v Speaker 3>we moved this thing off the road and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>

2648
01:59:17.110 --> 01:59:18.890
<v Speaker 3>and the kids were even normal about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like,</v>

2649
01:59:18.891 --> 01:59:19.810
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cool kid.</v>

2650
01:59:19.811 --> 01:59:20.644
<v Speaker 3>Now you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they've seen them 100 times and </v>

2651
01:59:21.461 --> 01:59:22.294
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anyone that wasn't from Australia </v>

2652
01:59:23.591 --> 01:59:25.480
<v Speaker 3>though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was saying this for the first time,</v>

2653
01:59:25.481 --> 01:59:26.314
<v Speaker 3>this animal with a beak,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I started thinking about it and </v>

2654
01:59:27.971 --> 01:59:31.000
<v Speaker 3>they turned back clothes like the </v>
<v Speaker 3>clothes turn back like that.</v>

2655
01:59:31.160 --> 01:59:32.250
<v Speaker 3>It's for digging,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2656
01:59:32.950 --> 01:59:34.600
<v Speaker 3>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As animal in the world.</v>

2657
01:59:34.630 --> 01:59:36.190
<v Speaker 3>When you think about it in that sense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2658
01:59:36.191 --> 01:59:38.890
<v Speaker 3>if you'd never ever seen one before and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you come across it for the first time,</v>

2659
01:59:38.891 --> 01:59:39.880
<v Speaker 3>you'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>

2660
01:59:39.881 --> 01:59:41.500
<v Speaker 3>look at this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This thing is crazy.</v>

2661
01:59:41.520 --> 01:59:42.550
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like a porcupine.</v>

2662
01:59:42.551 --> 01:59:44.260
<v Speaker 3>Fuck the duck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2663
01:59:44.300 --> 01:59:47.840
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't have a beak that's not a bad </v>
<v Speaker 3>guy.</v>

2664
01:59:47.900 --> 01:59:50.720
<v Speaker 3>Platypus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To their daily lives.</v>

2665
01:59:50.740 --> 01:59:51.440
<v Speaker 3>But there are a mammal.</v>

2666
01:59:51.440 --> 01:59:53.590
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they got like a big duck.</v>

2667
01:59:53.591 --> 01:59:54.970
<v Speaker 3>Big.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>

2668
01:59:55.210 --> 01:59:58.030
<v Speaker 3>But the laying of the eggs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so strange.</v>

2669
01:59:58.390 --> 02:00:00.970
<v Speaker 3>Like what is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've got a poisonous spark as well.</v>

2670
02:00:01.030 --> 02:00:01.863
<v Speaker 3>They do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2671
02:00:02.540 --> 02:00:03.373
<v Speaker 3>Where is it on the night of them?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Might be like a anal spark or something </v>

2672
02:00:07.061 --> 02:00:09.350
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mm hmm.</v>

2673
02:00:10.330 --> 02:00:11.170
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Interesting.</v>

2674
02:00:11.490 --> 02:00:13.920
<v Speaker 3>So it probably wouldn't want to play </v>
<v Speaker 3>around don't finger.</v>

2675
02:00:13.940 --> 02:00:18.430
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but just the wide variety of animal life</v>

2676
02:00:18.431 --> 02:00:20.530
<v Speaker 3>is very weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very weird.</v>

2677
02:00:20.531 --> 02:00:22.060
<v Speaker 3>When you think about how many different </v>
<v Speaker 3>things,</v>

2678
02:00:22.061 --> 02:00:22.894
<v Speaker 3>and then again what you were talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about about the introduction of foxes </v>

2679
02:00:25.930 --> 02:00:28.720
<v Speaker 3>and cats.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They all fit into a system.</v>

2680
02:00:28.721 --> 02:00:29.840
<v Speaker 3>Like look at that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's A.</v>

2681
02:00:30.150 --> 02:00:30.983
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it as like this funky kind of furry </v>

2682
02:00:33.131 --> 02:00:37.490
<v Speaker 3>beaver looking tail.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It has the tiniest little dots for eyes.</v>

2683
02:00:38.140 --> 02:00:40.190
<v Speaker 3>Webbed feet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

2684
02:00:40.870 --> 02:00:43.030
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever eaten beaver?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

2685
02:00:43.170 --> 02:00:45.520
<v Speaker 3>Had beaver with Rinella.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really good.</v>

2686
02:00:45.730 --> 02:00:48.400
<v Speaker 3>Really delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It tastes like beef.</v>

2687
02:00:48.520 --> 02:00:50.170
<v Speaker 3>I didn't like the sand event.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

2688
02:00:50.171 --> 02:00:51.004
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't either.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't have normally even thought </v>

2689
02:00:52.810 --> 02:00:54.250
<v Speaker 3>that you could eat it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>

2690
02:00:54.280 --> 02:00:55.113
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he killed one and then a braised it and </v>

2691
02:00:58.931 --> 02:00:59.764
<v Speaker 3>then slow cooked it and it was like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>pot roast with like potatoes and </v>

2692
02:01:03.340 --> 02:01:05.260
<v Speaker 3>carrots.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was delicious.</v>

2693
02:01:05.270 --> 02:01:06.103
<v Speaker 3>Thank the bear camp.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could never ate a beaver because </v>

2694
02:01:09.851 --> 02:01:12.980
<v Speaker 3>members of dead babies and bear camp.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

2695
02:01:14.130 --> 02:01:15.890
<v Speaker 3>It's the thought now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

2696
02:01:15.910 --> 02:01:16.780
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't do it.</v>

2697
02:01:16.900 --> 02:01:18.550
<v Speaker 3>I could,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unless I was slightly hungry.</v>

2698
02:01:18.580 --> 02:01:23.580
<v Speaker 3>I'll do it slightly telling you if </v>
<v Speaker 3>Steven Rinella cooked you a bowl of this</v>

2699
02:01:24.280 --> 02:01:26.380
<v Speaker 3>beaver pot roast or whatever the fuck it</v>
<v Speaker 3>is.</v>

2700
02:01:26.381 --> 02:01:27.610
<v Speaker 3>They made.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was amazing.</v>

2701
02:01:27.611 --> 02:01:29.380
<v Speaker 3>It was really good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It sounds good.</v>

2702
02:01:29.410 --> 02:01:31.540
<v Speaker 3>It was like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a strange beef,</v>

2703
02:01:31.810 --> 02:01:34.120
<v Speaker 3>like what an odd,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like maybe dry age beef.</v>

2704
02:01:34.160 --> 02:01:35.680
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like tend to me off again.</v>

2705
02:01:35.680 --> 02:01:39.650
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was like a beef from that was like,</v>

2706
02:01:39.651 --> 02:01:42.230
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is beef from Nicaragua.</v>

2707
02:01:42.410 --> 02:01:43.730
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting.</v>

2708
02:01:43.760 --> 02:01:45.710
<v Speaker 3>It's got a different flavor to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

2709
02:01:45.820 --> 02:01:47.330
<v Speaker 3>It's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>

2710
02:01:47.360 --> 02:01:50.420
<v Speaker 3>it's like it's reminiscent of beef,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a cousin of beef.</v>

2711
02:01:50.450 --> 02:01:52.460
<v Speaker 3>That's what it tastes like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A cousin of the.</v>

2712
02:01:52.580 --> 02:01:56.350
<v Speaker 3>It's very weird and it's kind of fatty </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's Kinda like tender.</v>

2713
02:01:56.460 --> 02:01:57.293
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2714
02:01:57.610 --> 02:01:58.443
<v Speaker 3>Steve,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll have to hook me up when I'm </v>

2715
02:01:59.061 --> 02:01:59.894
<v Speaker 3>telling you you'd be shocked somewhere </v>
<v Speaker 3>along the line they made it illegal to </v>

2716
02:02:03.741 --> 02:02:07.070
<v Speaker 3>hunt them for food though they're a fur </v>
<v Speaker 3>bearing animal,</v>

2717
02:02:07.160 --> 02:02:10.700
<v Speaker 3>so you have to have a fur trappers </v>
<v Speaker 3>license and America eat them.</v>

2718
02:02:11.690 --> 02:02:12.523
<v Speaker 3>But there's people at the turn of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>century like Rinella is amazing in his </v>

2719
02:02:15.741 --> 02:02:16.574
<v Speaker 3>knowledge of the history of animals and </v>
<v Speaker 3>America and the history of hunting in </v>

2720
02:02:20.091 --> 02:02:22.010
<v Speaker 3>America.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But apparently many,</v>

2721
02:02:22.011 --> 02:02:23.570
<v Speaker 3>many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many years ago,</v>

2722
02:02:24.010 --> 02:02:26.930
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>beaver trapping and beaver pelts were so</v>

2723
02:02:26.931 --> 02:02:27.764
<v Speaker 3>valuable that the richest man in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world in the early 18 hundreds made all </v>

2724
02:02:32.421 --> 02:02:34.280
<v Speaker 3>of his money from beaver pelts.</v>

2725
02:02:34.310 --> 02:02:35.570
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2726
02:02:36.080 --> 02:02:38.840
<v Speaker 3>We should bring that back in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Davis for law,</v>

2727
02:02:38.930 --> 02:02:39.763
<v Speaker 3>I think it was before felt and once they</v>
<v Speaker 3>came up with felt like for hats and </v>

2728
02:02:44.841 --> 02:02:47.180
<v Speaker 3>stuff like that because the gentlemen </v>
<v Speaker 3>war felt hats.</v>

2729
02:02:47.540 --> 02:02:52.540
<v Speaker 3>They didn't need beaver as much anymore </v>
<v Speaker 3>and beaver kind of fell out of favor and</v>

2730
02:02:52.611 --> 02:02:57.200
<v Speaker 3>people stopped,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stopped doing that to have big numbers.</v>

2731
02:02:57.250 --> 02:02:59.150
<v Speaker 3>The beaver population dropped at that </v>
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>

2732
02:03:00.550 --> 02:03:04.550
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>apparently behind animals,</v>

2733
02:03:04.610 --> 02:03:05.443
<v Speaker 3>you know when they've got that value on </v>
<v Speaker 3>them and there's just an open slaughter </v>

2734
02:03:07.851 --> 02:03:10.310
<v Speaker 3>is what seems to drive a lot of things </v>
<v Speaker 3>to extinction.</v>

2735
02:03:10.490 --> 02:03:11.323
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's one of the interesting things </v>

2736
02:03:12.411 --> 02:03:13.244
<v Speaker 3>about America,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if you buy elk or venison in </v>

2737
02:03:16.851 --> 02:03:19.340
<v Speaker 3>America,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most of it is from New Zealand,</v>

2738
02:03:19.790 --> 02:03:20.623
<v Speaker 3>which is really strange.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The reason is you can't like market </v>

2739
02:03:23.961 --> 02:03:24.794
<v Speaker 3>hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like a giant factor in the </v>

2740
02:03:29.210 --> 02:03:32.210
<v Speaker 3>slaughter of countless amounts of </v>
<v Speaker 3>buffalo,</v>

2741
02:03:32.480 --> 02:03:33.830
<v Speaker 3>of elk and deer.</v>

2742
02:03:33.830 --> 02:03:34.663
<v Speaker 3>Even antelope,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they killed everything back in the </v>

2743
02:03:37.190 --> 02:03:38.023
<v Speaker 3>day and it was a lot of men returning </v>
<v Speaker 3>from the war at the turn of the century </v>

2744
02:03:40.910 --> 02:03:43.770
<v Speaker 3>that just went on these trips and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>was.</v>

2745
02:03:43.810 --> 02:03:45.140
<v Speaker 3>That's the way that you could make </v>
<v Speaker 3>money.</v>

2746
02:03:45.380 --> 02:03:46.213
<v Speaker 3>That way you can make money is a go go </v>
<v Speaker 3>hunting for meat and that's when they </v>

2747
02:03:49.431 --> 02:03:51.070
<v Speaker 3>brought that to market.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2748
02:03:51.260 --> 02:03:52.093
<v Speaker 3>I mean the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the idea of these animals being </v>

2749
02:03:56.060 --> 02:03:59.900
<v Speaker 3>precious and preserved and wild life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way we think of it,</v>

2750
02:04:00.170 --> 02:04:02.360
<v Speaker 3>they didn't have these thoughts in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>18 hundreds.</v>

2751
02:04:02.361 --> 02:04:03.194
<v Speaker 3>They were just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a resource and they just abused </v>

2752
02:04:05.181 --> 02:04:06.014
<v Speaker 3>it and I just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean we've all seen the photos of the </v>

2753
02:04:07.941 --> 02:04:09.370
<v Speaker 3>stacks of buffaloes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2754
02:04:09.390 --> 02:04:12.520
<v Speaker 3>definitely a lot of religious for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>hides where we oxidize.</v>

2755
02:04:12.560 --> 02:04:14.780
<v Speaker 3>Definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think a lot of people think that still</v>

2756
02:04:14.781 --> 02:04:18.620
<v Speaker 3>happening today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like hunt is a still that soda person.</v>

2757
02:04:19.280 --> 02:04:23.360
<v Speaker 3>Whereas hunt is a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The ultimate conservationist now and the</v>

2758
02:04:23.361 --> 02:04:24.194
<v Speaker 3>system that America has got in place is </v>
<v Speaker 3>the best system anywhere in the world </v>

2759
02:04:26.931 --> 02:04:28.880
<v Speaker 3>where there's a tag,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a season,</v>

2760
02:04:29.150 --> 02:04:32.210
<v Speaker 3>like they manage and regulate the </v>
<v Speaker 3>population,</v>

2761
02:04:32.211 --> 02:04:35.630
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so let's just say a elk.</v>

2762
02:04:35.750 --> 02:04:38.310
<v Speaker 3>The numbers were down</v>

2763
02:04:38.580 --> 02:04:40.830
<v Speaker 2>the following year we'll.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There'd be less tags available.</v>

2764
02:04:41.190 --> 02:04:44.010
<v Speaker 2>It's as simple as that and that's why </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's such a good system.</v>

2765
02:04:44.520 --> 02:04:47.520
<v Speaker 2>In Australia we don't have that system </v>
<v Speaker 2>in place,</v>

2766
02:04:47.940 --> 02:04:48.773
<v Speaker 2>but in a sense it's pushed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pushed all the responsibility back on </v>

2767
02:04:52.050 --> 02:04:52.883
<v Speaker 2>hunters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I can tell you now you Australian </v>

2768
02:04:55.171 --> 02:05:00.171
<v Speaker 2>hunters are some of the best hunters in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the world because they've got a conserve</v>

2769
02:05:00.960 --> 02:05:04.200
<v Speaker 2>and they've got to manage their </v>
<v Speaker 2>resources,</v>

2770
02:05:04.260 --> 02:05:05.910
<v Speaker 2>their self.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing in place to say,</v>

2771
02:05:05.911 --> 02:05:06.744
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're only given 500 tags away for that </v>

2772
02:05:08.611 --> 02:05:10.530
<v Speaker 2>area this year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2773
02:05:10.710 --> 02:05:11.543
<v Speaker 2>because numbers are down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hannah's as much as we are conservation </v>

2774
02:05:14.970 --> 02:05:15.803
<v Speaker 2>conservationists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not going to go out and just </v>

2775
02:05:19.040 --> 02:05:20.280
<v Speaker 2>slaughter the numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2776
02:05:20.340 --> 02:05:21.100
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

2777
02:05:21.100 --> 02:05:23.040
<v Speaker 2>they're an introduced species into </v>
<v Speaker 2>Australia.</v>

2778
02:05:23.520 --> 02:05:24.353
<v Speaker 2>They are bad to the environment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If the numbers are too big and Hannah's </v>

2779
02:05:27.750 --> 02:05:30.040
<v Speaker 2>treat them like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were,</v>

2780
02:05:30.090 --> 02:05:32.220
<v Speaker 2>we're not going to go and wipe out the </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole population.</v>

2781
02:05:32.460 --> 02:05:33.780
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2782
02:05:34.230 --> 02:05:36.030
<v Speaker 2>is a very good at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2783
02:05:36.031 --> 02:05:36.864
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's only 20 bucks in this area at </v>

2784
02:05:38.701 --> 02:05:42.420
<v Speaker 2>the moment and there's [inaudible] there</v>
<v Speaker 2>should be a certain buck to doe ratio.</v>

2785
02:05:42.660 --> 02:05:44.910
<v Speaker 2>There's only 20 bucks in this area at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the moment.</v>

2786
02:05:45.060 --> 02:05:48.300
<v Speaker 2>We're not going to kill 19 of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's going to be one buck lift,</v>

2787
02:05:48.390 --> 02:05:49.223
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to kill the oldest buck in </v>

2788
02:05:50.011 --> 02:05:50.880
<v Speaker 2>that area.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's only 20.</v>

2789
02:05:50.881 --> 02:05:51.714
<v Speaker 2>They will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's just kill the oldest book in that </v>

2790
02:05:52.471 --> 02:05:53.850
<v Speaker 2>area.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a good population.</v>

2791
02:05:54.240 --> 02:05:55.980
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's sustainable.</v>

2792
02:05:56.220 --> 02:05:58.590
<v Speaker 2>They're not damaging the environment in </v>
<v Speaker 2>that number.</v>

2793
02:05:58.940 --> 02:05:59.773
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think there's a big difference </v>

2794
02:06:02.760 --> 02:06:07.500
<v Speaker 2>there between the American and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Australian hunter in that sense that,</v>

2795
02:06:07.710 --> 02:06:10.560
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you guys would do the same thing.</v>

2796
02:06:10.650 --> 02:06:11.483
<v Speaker 2>Don't get me wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if there wasn't a tag in place or </v>

2797
02:06:13.021 --> 02:06:16.340
<v Speaker 2>seasoned in place in today's society </v>
<v Speaker 2>would do the same thing.</v>

2798
02:06:16.350 --> 02:06:18.870
<v Speaker 3>I think I've learned from the past some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some would,</v>

2799
02:06:18.960 --> 02:06:19.793
<v Speaker 3>but there's a bunch of people that </v>
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't know that majority though the </v>

2800
02:06:23.040 --> 02:06:24.410
<v Speaker 3>majority,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but a,</v>

2801
02:06:24.690 --> 02:06:27.180
<v Speaker 3>I think there's quite a few that </v>
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't,</v>

2802
02:06:27.300 --> 02:06:28.940
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

2803
02:06:29.040 --> 02:06:30.540
<v Speaker 3>that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that,</v>

2804
02:06:30.550 --> 02:06:31.383
<v Speaker 3>that is one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the main stereotypes of the hunter is </v>

2805
02:06:35.010 --> 02:06:35.843
<v Speaker 3>beer drinking and shooting everything </v>
<v Speaker 3>that moves and I feel today that it </v>

2806
02:06:40.021 --> 02:06:40.854
<v Speaker 3>couldn't be further from the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems like there's more of the </v>

2807
02:06:43.921 --> 02:06:47.450
<v Speaker 3>responsible hunter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the one that's got a good job or,</v>

2808
02:06:47.700 --> 02:06:49.830
<v Speaker 3>or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or good business or whatever it is</v>

2809
02:06:49.900 --> 02:06:51.390
<v Speaker 2>that goes out and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and get.</v>

2810
02:06:51.420 --> 02:06:53.050
<v Speaker 2>You'll be in the perfect example of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2811
02:06:53.051 --> 02:06:53.884
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to thank you when I first come </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the show that the light that you've </v>

2812
02:06:56.401 --> 02:07:00.040
<v Speaker 2>shown on hunting is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is how hunters are today.</v>

2813
02:07:00.041 --> 02:07:00.874
<v Speaker 2>The majority of hunters are today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're just not these savage kilo </v>

2814
02:07:03.471 --> 02:07:04.630
<v Speaker 2>machines that are just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2815
02:07:04.631 --> 02:07:05.590
<v Speaker 2>kill it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2816
02:07:05.610 --> 02:07:07.780
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're very conservative in a sense.</v>

2817
02:07:08.110 --> 02:07:09.870
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2818
02:07:09.940 --> 02:07:10.773
<v Speaker 2>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not just about going out and </v>

2819
02:07:11.741 --> 02:07:12.574
<v Speaker 2>getting a shot off.</v>

2820
02:07:12.650 --> 02:07:15.170
<v Speaker 3>If you are that sort of hunter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe you're in it for all the wrong</v>

2821
02:07:15.171 --> 02:07:18.080
<v Speaker 3>reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's about the experience,</v>

2822
02:07:18.081 --> 02:07:22.040
<v Speaker 3>the connection with the outdoors that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that meet,</v>

2823
02:07:22.100 --> 02:07:23.450
<v Speaker 3>that precious meat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2824
02:07:23.451 --> 02:07:25.700
<v Speaker 3>that you'd get off each,</v>
<v Speaker 3>each one of those animals.</v>

2825
02:07:25.970 --> 02:07:26.803
<v Speaker 3>Also the money that we spend on gear,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the money that you spend on outfitters </v>

2826
02:07:30.541 --> 02:07:34.910
<v Speaker 3>and trips that money in tags in </v>
<v Speaker 3>particular all goes to conservation.</v>

2827
02:07:35.080 --> 02:07:36.160
<v Speaker 3>Preserving the habitat</v>

2828
02:07:36.160 --> 02:07:36.993
<v Speaker 2>of these animals and a lot of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>animals like especially like white tail </v>

2829
02:07:39.201 --> 02:07:40.034
<v Speaker 2>deer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's more white tailed deer here in </v>

2830
02:07:41.591 --> 02:07:42.424
<v Speaker 2>America today than there were when </v>
<v Speaker 2>Columbus came here and some of the </v>

2831
02:07:44.891 --> 02:07:45.970
<v Speaker 2>incomes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all,</v>

2832
02:07:45.971 --> 02:07:47.760
<v Speaker 2>some of these small towns rely on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2833
02:07:47.840 --> 02:07:50.890
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is very haunting and something that I've</v>

2834
02:07:50.891 --> 02:07:51.724
<v Speaker 2>always pushed because it's frowned upon </v>
<v Speaker 2>it in Australia in a big way because </v>

2835
02:07:54.700 --> 02:07:57.060
<v Speaker 2>it's not the typical thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hunting's not.</v>

2836
02:07:57.170 --> 02:07:59.230
<v Speaker 2>It's not definitely not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Definitely not.</v>

2837
02:07:59.320 --> 02:08:01.420
<v Speaker 2>And it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's not accepted like it is here in</v>

2838
02:08:01.421 --> 02:08:03.100
<v Speaker 2>America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How did you get into it?</v>

2839
02:08:03.530 --> 02:08:04.690
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got myself into it,</v>

2840
02:08:04.750 --> 02:08:05.980
<v Speaker 2>which was really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really weird.</v>

2841
02:08:05.981 --> 02:08:07.900
<v Speaker 2>Hoyt were asking me the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They lock off.</v>

2842
02:08:07.901 --> 02:08:09.700
<v Speaker 2>So did your dad hunt?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2843
02:08:09.940 --> 02:08:11.140
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2844
02:08:11.150 --> 02:08:14.130
<v Speaker 2>like I come from a broken family,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2845
02:08:14.260 --> 02:08:16.270
<v Speaker 2>I seen a barber shop in a store and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>was like,</v>

2846
02:08:16.540 --> 02:08:18.550
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's that thing?</v>

2847
02:08:19.060 --> 02:08:20.710
<v Speaker 2>Because it was like a compound bow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2848
02:08:20.711 --> 02:08:21.461
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's that thing?</v>

2849
02:08:21.461 --> 02:08:21.941
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2850
02:08:21.941 --> 02:08:22.774
<v Speaker 2>it's a bow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I ended up buying the bow and </v>

2851
02:08:26.110 --> 02:08:28.930
<v Speaker 2>when I bought the bow he gave me like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was just a black and white magazine,</v>

2852
02:08:28.931 --> 02:08:29.764
<v Speaker 2>like I was 97 and then I'd run around </v>
<v Speaker 2>with like a fiberglass pole with a </v>

2853
02:08:33.161 --> 02:08:33.994
<v Speaker 2>string.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Been on it before and used to make my </v>

2854
02:08:34.781 --> 02:08:36.160
<v Speaker 2>own arrows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Robin Hood stuff,</v>

2855
02:08:36.161 --> 02:08:38.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but never had seen anything like that in</v>

2856
02:08:38.921 --> 02:08:39.754
<v Speaker 2>the magazine he gave me was a guy with a</v>
<v Speaker 2>massive big water buffalo on the front </v>

2857
02:08:44.351 --> 02:08:45.390
<v Speaker 2>cover.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

2858
02:08:45.391 --> 02:08:47.580
<v Speaker 2>you can kill things with this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

2859
02:08:47.600 --> 02:08:50.200
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the majority of people had never hunted,</v>

2860
02:08:50.320 --> 02:08:52.890
<v Speaker 2>been like it like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you can kill a rabbit with one hour,</v>

2861
02:08:52.900 --> 02:08:55.220
<v Speaker 2>but if you're gonna shoot a buffalo must</v>
<v Speaker 2>like take 20 Harris.</v>

2862
02:08:55.880 --> 02:08:57.290
<v Speaker 2>So I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the time,</v>

2863
02:08:57.291 --> 02:08:58.124
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he must have shot it like 20 times or </v>

2864
02:08:59.111 --> 02:08:59.944
<v Speaker 2>something like that to kill it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No rabbits got a pair of lungs above </v>

2865
02:09:02.621 --> 02:09:03.630
<v Speaker 2>loads.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Got a pair of lungs,</v>

2866
02:09:03.640 --> 02:09:05.260
<v Speaker 2>you put an hole through both of those </v>
<v Speaker 2>lungs.</v>

2867
02:09:05.261 --> 02:09:07.060
<v Speaker 2>That thing's dead in the same amount of </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

2868
02:09:08.200 --> 02:09:10.810
<v Speaker 2>Well now I've shot a bunch of Buffalo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2869
02:09:10.811 --> 02:09:13.210
<v Speaker 2>and it's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the craziest thing,</v>

2870
02:09:13.211 --> 02:09:14.044
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just like it was a guy and a </v>

2871
02:09:15.131 --> 02:09:17.740
<v Speaker 2>magazine with a buffalo dead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

2872
02:09:17.770 --> 02:09:20.770
<v Speaker 2>you can kill things that and now </v>
<v Speaker 2>unlocked this full blown hunter,</v>

2873
02:09:21.160 --> 02:09:22.000
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's just.</v>

2874
02:09:22.060 --> 02:09:23.710
<v Speaker 2>How did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was the process though?</v>

2875
02:09:23.711 --> 02:09:26.260
<v Speaker 2>So you got to go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And did you take lessons?</v>

2876
02:09:26.261 --> 02:09:27.094
<v Speaker 2>Did you teach lessons?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just taught myself with what year is </v>

2877
02:09:29.471 --> 02:09:31.030
<v Speaker 2>this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2878
02:09:31.910 --> 02:09:35.690
<v Speaker 2>will all 17.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm 28.</v>

2879
02:09:35.890 --> 02:09:38.860
<v Speaker 2>I wish I was 2020 nights tomorrow.</v>

2880
02:09:38.860 --> 02:09:41.410
<v Speaker 2>And just to heat right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's my birthday in Australia today,</v>

2881
02:09:41.440 --> 02:09:43.870
<v Speaker 2>so I'm 30,</v>
<v Speaker 2>36,</v>

2882
02:09:44.170 --> 02:09:47.740
<v Speaker 2>so I was 17 at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it would have been 97.</v>

2883
02:09:48.310 --> 02:09:50.550
<v Speaker 2>So it's almost 20 years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost 20 years.</v>

2884
02:09:50.570 --> 02:09:53.110
<v Speaker 2>You're dealing with very little internet</v>
<v Speaker 2>back then,</v>

2885
02:09:53.111 --> 02:09:54.460
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No Internet.</v>

2886
02:09:54.530 --> 02:09:57.310
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So even though we invented Wifi,</v>

2887
02:09:59.370 --> 02:10:01.870
<v Speaker 2>you guys didn't have Australia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We probably did.</v>

2888
02:10:02.140 --> 02:10:03.190
<v Speaker 2>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was poor.</v>

2889
02:10:03.191 --> 02:10:04.480
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're not.</v>

2890
02:10:04.870 --> 02:10:06.670
<v Speaker 2>My point is you're not getting any </v>
<v Speaker 2>information.</v>

2891
02:10:07.450 --> 02:10:08.160
<v Speaker 2>Teaching.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Learn.</v>

2892
02:10:08.160 --> 02:10:09.370
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your mistakes.</v>

2893
02:10:09.400 --> 02:10:10.233
<v Speaker 2>That's what I was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually was a big part of a bow </v>

2894
02:10:12.630 --> 02:10:13.463
<v Speaker 2>hunting for ministry for many years and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I just like if I had that when I was </v>

2895
02:10:17.261 --> 02:10:20.560
<v Speaker 2>coming up through boning the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>energy and money,</v>

2896
02:10:20.561 --> 02:10:21.394
<v Speaker 2>that all would've saved by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by just getting the right information </v>

2897
02:10:24.731 --> 02:10:27.640
<v Speaker 2>straight off the internet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like being able to do research or,</v>

2898
02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:30.860
<v Speaker 2>or even us going to a club and there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2899
02:10:30.880 --> 02:10:34.130
<v Speaker 2>there's 20 other guys at the club that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you could at least information out of.</v>

2900
02:10:34.520 --> 02:10:38.540
<v Speaker 2>I never had any of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's shit still got killed,</v>

2901
02:10:38.860 --> 02:10:40.250
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what I always say to people.</v>

2902
02:10:40.251 --> 02:10:40.730
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

2903
02:10:40.730 --> 02:10:41.480
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

2904
02:10:41.480 --> 02:10:42.313
<v Speaker 2>you don't need the best of everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If your budget can only afford you some </v>

2905
02:10:47.510 --> 02:10:48.343
<v Speaker 2>raker bow and some cheap arrows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guarantee you're still going to be </v>

2906
02:10:51.981 --> 02:10:55.190
<v Speaker 2>successful with that gear if you put in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the time,</v>

2907
02:10:55.710 --> 02:10:57.950
<v Speaker 2>there's no doubt about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2908
02:10:58.490 --> 02:11:03.350
<v Speaker 2>so I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just had this cheapo cheap arrows,</v>

2909
02:11:03.800 --> 02:11:04.633
<v Speaker 2>probably didn't even wear camouflage at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the time and just went out into the </v>

2910
02:11:07.941 --> 02:11:10.730
<v Speaker 2>outdoors and just worked it out myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2911
02:11:10.920 --> 02:11:13.310
<v Speaker 2>prearranged finders,</v>
<v Speaker 2>free range finders.</v>

2912
02:11:13.370 --> 02:11:17.960
<v Speaker 2>So how did you decide like where to aim?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a guest.</v>

2913
02:11:17.961 --> 02:11:18.910
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll use,</v>

2914
02:11:19.290 --> 02:11:22.130
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're using your own knowledge,</v>

2915
02:11:22.131 --> 02:11:22.964
<v Speaker 2>you'll use in your own skills.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what sucks about someone today's </v>

2916
02:11:26.181 --> 02:11:28.370
<v Speaker 2>technology in that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you lose that,</v>

2917
02:11:28.371 --> 02:11:29.120
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2918
02:11:29.120 --> 02:11:31.670
<v Speaker 2>You're using a range finder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're relying on the range finder.</v>

2919
02:11:32.420 --> 02:11:33.253
<v Speaker 2>I still go out to the range sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 2>where I'll just go around shooting </v>

2920
02:11:35.960 --> 02:11:38.120
<v Speaker 2>clumps across or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've noted rangefinder.</v>

2921
02:11:38.600 --> 02:11:40.660
<v Speaker 2>Guess the distance have a shot than </v>
<v Speaker 2>ranger.</v>

2922
02:11:40.730 --> 02:11:44.030
<v Speaker 2>Just just so you get to learn distances </v>
<v Speaker 2>and know distances.</v>

2923
02:11:44.510 --> 02:11:46.880
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty good at like 30 yards.</v>

2924
02:11:47.690 --> 02:11:50.720
<v Speaker 2>10 not released.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just did.</v>

2925
02:11:50.900 --> 02:11:52.640
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you do with your fingers.</v>

2926
02:11:52.730 --> 02:11:55.180
<v Speaker 2>When did you start using a release aid?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2927
02:11:55.220 --> 02:11:59.000
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what year it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm 10 years in.</v>

2928
02:11:59.120 --> 02:11:59.953
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about 10 years in where you are making </v>

2929
02:12:01.341 --> 02:12:03.320
<v Speaker 2>your own arrows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who was making it like mine?</v>

2930
02:12:03.330 --> 02:12:04.240
<v Speaker 2>Ours,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our team.</v>

2931
02:12:04.250 --> 02:12:06.160
<v Speaker 2>The arrows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you'd use team Barrows,</v>

2932
02:12:06.161 --> 02:12:07.350
<v Speaker 2>the big tube light.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Broader.</v>

2933
02:12:07.740 --> 02:12:09.710
<v Speaker 2>You're saying timber,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that what you're saying?</v>

2934
02:12:09.790 --> 02:12:11.110
<v Speaker 2>Timber.</v>

2935
02:12:11.140 --> 02:12:11.720

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2936
02:12:11.720 --> 02:12:12.470
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2937
02:12:12.470 --> 02:12:14.810
<v Speaker 2>So would arrows you making your own wood</v>
<v Speaker 2>arrows?</v>

2938
02:12:14.870 --> 02:12:15.703
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're cutting your own dowels and the </v>

2939
02:12:16.491 --> 02:12:19.340
<v Speaker 2>whole deal some guys did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd be able to just buy,</v>

2940
02:12:19.570 --> 02:12:20.403
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like 12 Dale's already spawn that old </v>

2941
02:12:23.460 --> 02:12:26.910
<v Speaker 2>respond tested to say 80 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you'd glue,</v>

2942
02:12:26.911 --> 02:12:28.610
<v Speaker 2>you brought it on your lap in the front </v>
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>

2943
02:12:28.670 --> 02:12:29.870
<v Speaker 2>You'd glue your.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brought it on,</v>

2944
02:12:30.050 --> 02:12:31.100
<v Speaker 2>you glued it on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2945
02:12:31.101 --> 02:12:34.320
<v Speaker 2>Equally you brought it on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No inserts.</v>

2946
02:12:35.810 --> 02:12:36.643
<v Speaker 2>And then feathers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd use five inch feathers on </v>

2947
02:12:38.481 --> 02:12:42.060
<v Speaker 2>everything and just fingers on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>strings.</v>

2948
02:12:42.080 --> 02:12:44.780
<v Speaker 2>Free figures on the string.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No sites or anything like that.</v>

2949
02:12:44.781 --> 02:12:48.530
<v Speaker 2>It was just one sided.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was very instinctive shooting or some</v>

2950
02:12:48.531 --> 02:12:52.100
<v Speaker 2>guys would use the Arrow and line up </v>
<v Speaker 2>down the road down there at the animal,</v>

2951
02:12:52.550 --> 02:12:55.130
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of the times were effective out to</v>

2952
02:12:55.220 --> 02:12:55.851
<v Speaker 2>50,</v>
<v Speaker 2>60,</v>

2953
02:12:55.851 --> 02:12:57.920
<v Speaker 2>70 meters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you did enough practice,</v>

2954
02:12:57.950 --> 02:12:59.870
<v Speaker 2>you will still effective out to those </v>
<v Speaker 2>ranges,</v>

2955
02:12:59.871 --> 02:13:01.430
<v Speaker 2>but it took a lot more time.</v>

2956
02:13:01.460 --> 02:13:05.210
<v Speaker 2>Did you wear your arrows and where your </v>
<v Speaker 2>broadheads way arrows and broader.</v>

2957
02:13:05.360 --> 02:13:07.700
<v Speaker 2>So you've kind of kept him in a certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>range.</v>

2958
02:13:07.760 --> 02:13:09.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You keep them all identical.</v>

2959
02:13:09.501 --> 02:13:12.160
<v Speaker 2>You'd spin testimonial when.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why want you put your broad it on him?</v>

2960
02:13:12.510 --> 02:13:13.343
<v Speaker 2>I'm good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could get spawned as back in those </v>

2961
02:13:15.561 --> 02:13:16.394
<v Speaker 2>days and you'd buy and test them and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd turn your shop to get to the </v>

2962
02:13:19.131 --> 02:13:21.230
<v Speaker 2>closest spinal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wouldn't be perfect on each one.</v>

2963
02:13:21.260 --> 02:13:25.100
<v Speaker 2>We're talking timber here and you get </v>
<v Speaker 2>your spine pretty accurate on each one.</v>

2964
02:13:25.101 --> 02:13:26.930
<v Speaker 2>You'd glue your.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brought it on in that sense.</v>

2965
02:13:26.960 --> 02:13:27.820
<v Speaker 2>And yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And your,</v>

2966
02:13:28.400 --> 02:13:29.720
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your knock as well.</v>

2967
02:13:30.170 --> 02:13:33.360
<v Speaker 2>So everyone was spine the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Up and down.</v>

2968
02:13:33.361 --> 02:13:34.530
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

2969
02:13:34.590 --> 02:13:35.880
<v Speaker 2>Two years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sam.</v>

2970
02:13:35.970 --> 02:13:37.410
<v Speaker 2>Pioneer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Simple.</v>

2971
02:13:37.500 --> 02:13:39.680
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a funny thing.</v>

2972
02:13:39.800 --> 02:13:40.633
<v Speaker 2>Like a mountain man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trappers and came over here on beaver </v>

2973
02:13:43.561 --> 02:13:48.150
<v Speaker 2>skin Qa practice a lot so I can go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll go,</v>

2974
02:13:48.650 --> 02:13:53.650
<v Speaker 2>I'll get the height defiant there and </v>
<v Speaker 2>all site that bow in and yeah,</v>

2975
02:13:54.280 --> 02:13:56.490
<v Speaker 2>I can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll just shoot once a week or whatever,</v>

2976
02:13:56.910 --> 02:13:58.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I can shoot daily I will.</v>

2977
02:13:58.650 --> 02:14:01.500
<v Speaker 2>But with traditional gear you had to </v>
<v Speaker 2>shoot daily.</v>

2978
02:14:01.830 --> 02:14:02.663
<v Speaker 2>You had to have either 50 or 100 hours </v>
<v Speaker 2>every single day just just to keep the </v>

2979
02:14:06.361 --> 02:14:07.860
<v Speaker 2>skill level up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2980
02:14:07.910 --> 02:14:10.510
<v Speaker 2>and it was same shooting a bow that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>open sites,</v>

2981
02:14:10.710 --> 02:14:12.570
<v Speaker 2>no sites or anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And fingers.</v>

2982
02:14:12.571 --> 02:14:14.820
<v Speaker 2>You had to constantly shoot that boat to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be,</v>

2983
02:14:15.030 --> 02:14:15.863
<v Speaker 2>to be accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's almost like throwing a rock in </v>

2984
02:14:17.531 --> 02:14:21.360
<v Speaker 2>that you've got to kind of have a sense </v>
<v Speaker 2>of how far it's gonna go with the amount</v>

2985
02:14:21.361 --> 02:14:22.380
<v Speaker 2>of effort.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

2986
02:14:22.381 --> 02:14:23.420
<v Speaker 2>Like thrown a rock.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2987
02:14:23.490 --> 02:14:27.330
<v Speaker 2>Where to pick it up so that if you know </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a certain distance away,</v>

2988
02:14:27.331 --> 02:14:29.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you kind of in your head know the arc of</v>

2989
02:14:29.581 --> 02:14:30.414
<v Speaker 2>the era.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't get a new boss every year </v>

2990
02:14:31.890 --> 02:14:34.560
<v Speaker 2>because I would walk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you've got a new bow,</v>

2991
02:14:34.561 --> 02:14:37.840
<v Speaker 2>you had to start all over again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whereas I knew the costs of that bow,</v>

2992
02:14:37.841 --> 02:14:39.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know we're an RFL.</v>

2993
02:14:39.450 --> 02:14:42.350
<v Speaker 2>I know we're in our flat too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2994
02:14:43.170 --> 02:14:45.090
<v Speaker 2>but like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you hunting,</v>

2995
02:14:45.290 --> 02:14:48.660
<v Speaker 2>I used to kill just as much back then as</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do today with today's technology.</v>

2996
02:14:48.661 --> 02:14:51.480
<v Speaker 2>But I've got to spend less time with </v>
<v Speaker 2>today's technology.</v>

2997
02:14:51.780 --> 02:14:53.250
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're also in Australia,</v>

2998
02:14:53.251 --> 02:14:55.090
<v Speaker 2>which is very different because you were</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you were saying.</v>

2999
02:14:55.200 --> 02:14:57.180
<v Speaker 2>You can only eat brown.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can hunt all year round.</v>

3000
02:14:57.181 --> 02:14:58.014
<v Speaker 2>You can shoot things every day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could shoot as many animals as you </v>

3001
02:14:59.701 --> 02:15:00.570
<v Speaker 2>want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

3002
02:15:00.690 --> 02:15:03.030
<v Speaker 2>So you could go out and one day and </v>
<v Speaker 2>killed 12 dear.</v>

3003
02:15:03.450 --> 02:15:04.283
<v Speaker 2>And that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just take them and give them your </v>

3004
02:15:05.821 --> 02:15:07.410
<v Speaker 2>friends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wouldn't if you,</v>

3005
02:15:07.630 --> 02:15:09.750
<v Speaker 2>you wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless you were just calling because the</v>

3006
02:15:09.751 --> 02:15:13.320
<v Speaker 2>numbers have got a badge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm lucky you could,</v>

3007
02:15:13.350 --> 02:15:17.110
<v Speaker 2>you could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you definitely could get and it'd be no.</v>

3008
02:15:17.600 --> 02:15:20.360
<v Speaker 2>And then you just have a lot of friends </v>
<v Speaker 2>and just get given to me.</v>

3009
02:15:20.400 --> 02:15:21.233
<v Speaker 2>He had.</v>

3010
02:15:23.250 --> 02:15:23.870
<v Speaker 2>Do you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3011
02:15:23.870 --> 02:15:25.350
<v Speaker 2>do you wind up giving a lot of your meat</v>
<v Speaker 2>away?</v>

3012
02:15:25.420 --> 02:15:26.860
<v Speaker 2>Heaps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He heaps,</v>

3013
02:15:26.890 --> 02:15:28.180
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3014
02:15:28.780 --> 02:15:29.613
<v Speaker 2>I liked shooting a deer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why they fat so before they go into the </v>

3015
02:15:31.501 --> 02:15:32.334
<v Speaker 2>rotc because they go into the rotc fat </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they come out looking like a grey </v>

3016
02:15:34.901 --> 02:15:35.840
<v Speaker 2>hound,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3017
02:15:35.880 --> 02:15:38.310
<v Speaker 2>they just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just lost so much condition.</v>

3018
02:15:38.850 --> 02:15:39.683
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I like to shoot a couple of days </v>

3019
02:15:40.800 --> 02:15:41.633
<v Speaker 2>before the Rock and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've also got a lot of fat on him at </v>

3020
02:15:44.791 --> 02:15:45.624
<v Speaker 2>that point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is really good for making </v>

3021
02:15:46.201 --> 02:15:47.970
<v Speaker 2>sausages.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I lock my command and sausages,</v>

3022
02:15:48.660 --> 02:15:49.493
<v Speaker 2>I'll feel the phrase with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I've just got a list of just </v>

3023
02:15:51.721 --> 02:15:53.270
<v Speaker 2>family,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like put friends aside.</v>

3024
02:15:53.280 --> 02:15:55.650
<v Speaker 2>I've just got a list of family that will</v>
<v Speaker 2>take the meat off me,</v>

3025
02:15:56.760 --> 02:15:57.593
<v Speaker 2>which is really good because especially </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the da that a lot of the teammate </v>

3026
02:15:59.920 --> 02:16:00.753
<v Speaker 2>gets all used,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of that big mountain bowls and </v>

3027
02:16:03.241 --> 02:16:06.540
<v Speaker 2>things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a big fan of eight.</v>

3028
02:16:06.541 --> 02:16:07.960
<v Speaker 2>And then big rank bowl is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3029
02:16:07.970 --> 02:16:08.803
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's super super gaming but still </v>

3030
02:16:11.041 --> 02:16:11.874
<v Speaker 2>doesn't go to waste.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's doug made or it goes back in the </v>

3031
02:16:13.480 --> 02:16:16.620
<v Speaker 2>mother nature right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then have you ever brined them?</v>

3032
02:16:16.680 --> 02:16:19.800
<v Speaker 2>Like Brian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a board had going to try my buddy,</v>

3033
02:16:19.801 --> 02:16:22.490
<v Speaker 2>Antonio does all that sort of stuff and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he makes those um,</v>

3034
02:16:23.060 --> 02:16:24.440
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like big cranks,</v>

3035
02:16:24.770 --> 02:16:27.110
<v Speaker 2>sausages,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a cured sausage man.</v>

3036
02:16:27.120 --> 02:16:29.100
<v Speaker 2>Delicious or some.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3037
02:16:29.110 --> 02:16:30.100
<v Speaker 2>Apparently like</v>

3038
02:16:30.100 --> 02:16:33.250
<v Speaker 3>if you cook them well those old boards </v>
<v Speaker 3>are really delicious.</v>

3039
02:16:33.251 --> 02:16:36.400
<v Speaker 3>You just have to know how to like brine </v>
<v Speaker 3>them and cook them.</v>

3040
02:16:36.401 --> 02:16:38.100
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Europeans love them.</v>

3041
02:16:38.160 --> 02:16:40.840
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we've got our professional like pig,</v>

3042
02:16:40.890 --> 02:16:44.320
<v Speaker 3>his back home that hunt for human </v>
<v Speaker 3>consumption.</v>

3043
02:16:44.321 --> 02:16:45.154
<v Speaker 3>They make goes to humans and consumption</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the majority of it gets sent </v>

3044
02:16:48.011 --> 02:16:48.844
<v Speaker 3>overseas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they love it and they pay big </v>

3045
02:16:49.811 --> 02:16:50.970
<v Speaker 3>dollars for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are they,</v>

3046
02:16:51.010 --> 02:16:51.843
<v Speaker 3>how do they consume it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like about sausage or anything I </v>

3047
02:16:54.950 --> 02:16:56.080
<v Speaker 3>suppose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the whole,</v>

3048
02:16:56.110 --> 02:16:58.450
<v Speaker 3>the whole animal gets shipped right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I wonder what they,</v>

3049
02:16:58.630 --> 02:16:59.463
<v Speaker 3>how they mainly eat it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Denying him the rod is a crazy thing </v>

3050
02:17:03.941 --> 02:17:05.600
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And most people aren't aware of,</v>

3051
02:17:05.610 --> 02:17:09.010
<v Speaker 3>but deer and elk and I guess stags,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of those other animals,</v>

3052
02:17:09.190 --> 02:17:11.930
<v Speaker 3>they only have sex once a year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so all year.</v>

3053
02:17:14.020 --> 02:17:17.260
<v Speaker 3>But what a crazy design like nature has </v>
<v Speaker 3>it set up.</v>

3054
02:17:17.290 --> 02:17:19.210
<v Speaker 3>So most of the here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not even horn.</v>

3055
02:17:19.211 --> 02:17:20.160
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3056
02:17:20.290 --> 02:17:24.940
<v Speaker 3>Then one time a year they lose their </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking minds.</v>

3057
02:17:24.941 --> 02:17:28.060
<v Speaker 3>It's just crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't drink.</v>

3058
02:17:28.120 --> 02:17:31.270
<v Speaker 3>That's the only thing on their mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just go ballistic all day long.</v>

3059
02:17:31.330 --> 02:17:33.790
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes all night long.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never hunted deer in the Rut.</v>

3060
02:17:34.150 --> 02:17:35.860
<v Speaker 3>I've only hunted deer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3061
02:17:36.100 --> 02:17:38.230
<v Speaker 3>in Wisconsin in season.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

3062
02:17:38.320 --> 02:17:42.160
<v Speaker 3>in Montana we hunted deer and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>weren't in the Rut,</v>

3063
02:17:42.460 --> 02:17:44.560
<v Speaker 3>but apparently when they're in the Rut </v>
<v Speaker 3>they lose their marbles.</v>

3064
02:17:44.920 --> 02:17:45.753
<v Speaker 3>But I've seen elk in the Rut and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>the most bizarre thing kind of in </v>

3065
02:17:49.990 --> 02:17:52.880
<v Speaker 3>control that tongue anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just hanging out there.</v>

3066
02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:55.540
<v Speaker 3>Dick is flopping up and down when they </v>
<v Speaker 3>scream,</v>

3067
02:17:55.600 --> 02:17:59.260
<v Speaker 3>literally they have a rod going all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>time that isn't all over their chest.</v>

3068
02:17:59.560 --> 02:18:01.650
<v Speaker 3>They're screaming at the top of their </v>
<v Speaker 3>lungs.</v>

3069
02:18:02.170 --> 02:18:05.410
<v Speaker 3>It's a red stags.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I put their head between their legs,</v>

3070
02:18:05.440 --> 02:18:07.660
<v Speaker 3>look there in the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That put the head between their legs.</v>

3071
02:18:07.950 --> 02:18:12.950
<v Speaker 3>They piss in their mouth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they hold the bolt in the mouse Gogol it</v>

3072
02:18:13.090 --> 02:18:14.950
<v Speaker 3>as I tried along because my oldest </v>
<v Speaker 3>brother,</v>

3073
02:18:14.960 --> 02:18:15.793
<v Speaker 3>he goes all over their body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I could imagine doing that before </v>

3074
02:18:18.161 --> 02:18:18.994
<v Speaker 3>sex.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

3075
02:18:19.640 --> 02:18:20.473
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just got to get these done by pissing </v>

3076
02:18:22.061 --> 02:18:24.970
<v Speaker 3>my math is right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got to get ready baby.</v>

3077
02:18:25.180 --> 02:18:28.570
<v Speaker 3>You know how I feel about you off when </v>
<v Speaker 3>that happens.</v>

3078
02:18:28.571 --> 02:18:30.280
<v Speaker 3>Like they have prints in there and look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm king.</v>

3079
02:18:30.281 --> 02:18:32.650
<v Speaker 3>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wonder what that's all about.</v>

3080
02:18:32.651 --> 02:18:33.484
<v Speaker 3>Like what kind of evolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 3>advantages there to pissing in your own </v>

3081
02:18:35.831 --> 02:18:36.664
<v Speaker 3>mouth and spraying it up and regular we </v>
<v Speaker 3>ever done that and then they're just </v>

3082
02:18:38.741 --> 02:18:39.101
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3083
02:18:39.101 --> 02:18:42.640
<v Speaker 3>we're not going to write this bidding </v>
<v Speaker 3>anymore because it's just drastic.</v>

3084
02:18:42.641 --> 02:18:43.400
<v Speaker 3>We really don't need it.</v>

3085
02:18:43.400 --> 02:18:45.250
<v Speaker 3>It's not benefit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'd get yellow teeth.</v>

3086
02:18:45.840 --> 02:18:48.700
<v Speaker 3>You just lie on your shoulders with your</v>
<v Speaker 3>ass up in the air.</v>

3087
02:18:48.950 --> 02:18:51.790
<v Speaker 3>Just with his hold on the back of your </v>
<v Speaker 3>knees.</v>

3088
02:18:51.791 --> 02:18:56.791
<v Speaker 3>You've got a scoop them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Would it pull you towards a.</v>

3089
02:18:57.490 --> 02:18:59.530
<v Speaker 3>it's hard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's awesome to say.</v>

3090
02:19:00.800 --> 02:19:02.740
<v Speaker 3>I got to see the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See if you could find that.</v>

3091
02:19:02.741 --> 02:19:04.420
<v Speaker 3>Is it a red deer?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Red Deer?</v>

3092
02:19:04.480 --> 02:19:06.030
<v Speaker 3>I think at Rusa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dave won't do it.</v>

3093
02:19:06.040 --> 02:19:07.700
<v Speaker 3>Two days.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Super mediated it.</v>

3094
02:19:07.710 --> 02:19:10.250
<v Speaker 3>They're the ones that roar like a lion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3095
02:19:10.690 --> 02:19:11.523
<v Speaker 3>What a weird fucking noise that is so </v>
<v Speaker 3>painful that a lot of people don't even </v>

3096
02:19:14.741 --> 02:19:15.574
<v Speaker 3>realize is deer in Australia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's six spaces in Australia and </v>

3097
02:19:18.101 --> 02:19:20.380
<v Speaker 3>they'll go out camping and now he that </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they've,</v>

3098
02:19:20.830 --> 02:19:21.401
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're like,</v>

3099
02:19:21.401 --> 02:19:23.710
<v Speaker 3>oh there's a big cat in Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3100
02:19:23.711 --> 02:19:25.210
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cause that's like a bit of a myth,</v>

3101
02:19:25.240 --> 02:19:26.073
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like there's big cats in Australia and </v>

3102
02:19:27.320 --> 02:19:28.880
<v Speaker 3>that's what makes it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people think of it,</v>

3103
02:19:28.881 --> 02:19:29.420
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're like,</v>

3104
02:19:29.420 --> 02:19:30.260
<v Speaker 3>we're scared shitless.</v>

3105
02:19:30.260 --> 02:19:31.610
<v Speaker 3>We couldn't sleep last night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>

3106
02:19:31.611 --> 02:19:32.750
<v Speaker 3>where was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where's the spot?</v>

3107
02:19:32.751 --> 02:19:34.760
<v Speaker 3>I want to know where the bodies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I know it's a deer.</v>

3108
02:19:35.380 --> 02:19:36.950
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well did you hear that?</v>

3109
02:19:36.951 --> 02:19:39.380
<v Speaker 3>There was a rumor for like years and </v>
<v Speaker 3>years and years.</v>

3110
02:19:39.381 --> 02:19:40.214
<v Speaker 3>People had talked about spotting big </v>
<v Speaker 3>cats in the UK and then they found out </v>

3111
02:19:44.131 --> 02:19:47.490
<v Speaker 3>that there was a fucking sanctuary that </v>
<v Speaker 3>released brands.</v>

3112
02:19:47.560 --> 02:19:49.280
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just admitted to it.</v>

3113
02:19:49.281 --> 02:19:52.580
<v Speaker 3>Then in the nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the late eighties or nineties,</v>

3114
02:19:52.581 --> 02:19:56.830
<v Speaker 3>they had released like a couple of Pumas</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the UK countryside.</v>

3115
02:19:56.840 --> 02:20:00.620
<v Speaker 3>So in this system is Puma Puma's?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3116
02:20:00.621 --> 02:20:04.100
<v Speaker 3>like the Sneaker Puma,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like welcome to America.</v>

3117
02:20:04.310 --> 02:20:05.000
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here he is.</v>

3118
02:20:05.000 --> 02:20:06.120
<v Speaker 3>He's pissing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

3119
02:20:06.250 --> 02:20:09.660
<v Speaker 3>like he's pissing in his fucking mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3120
02:20:09.680 --> 02:20:11.780
<v Speaker 3>what in the hell?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he loves it.</v>

3121
02:20:11.900 --> 02:20:13.260
<v Speaker 3>So he tried it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That knock it,</v>

3122
02:20:13.340 --> 02:20:14.500
<v Speaker 3>give it a go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

3123
02:20:14.750 --> 02:20:16.250
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's pissing all over himself.</v>

3124
02:20:16.280 --> 02:20:19.100
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't even look like you're doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>it for the fuck of it.</v>

3125
02:20:19.670 --> 02:20:20.840
<v Speaker 3>You don't think he's in the Rut?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not.</v>

3126
02:20:20.990 --> 02:20:21.823
<v Speaker 3>There's another stag there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You should be beating the shit out of </v>

3127
02:20:22.941 --> 02:20:24.170
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's a little one now.</v>

3128
02:20:24.260 --> 02:20:25.093
<v Speaker 3>The other stag is big.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He probably got to be real careful with </v>

3129
02:20:27.300 --> 02:20:29.960
<v Speaker 3>that other dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are they not doing it right?</v>

3130
02:20:30.240 --> 02:20:32.840
<v Speaker 3>A piston right in his mouth so he can </v>
<v Speaker 3>go.</v>

3131
02:20:33.230 --> 02:20:34.670
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the thing in New Zealand,</v>

3132
02:20:34.970 --> 02:20:35.803
<v Speaker 3>New Zealand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of the stags or they're high </v>

3133
02:20:37.611 --> 02:20:39.080
<v Speaker 3>fence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hide it.</v>

3134
02:20:39.140 --> 02:20:41.210
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to piss off some Honda's at</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dewa,</v>

3135
02:20:41.211 --> 02:20:42.044
<v Speaker 3>but closed range is against everything </v>
<v Speaker 3>that I'm about because it's a fight </v>

3136
02:20:46.371 --> 02:20:47.204
<v Speaker 3>currency for what hunting is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get these massive big red stags and </v>

3137
02:20:50.241 --> 02:20:54.250
<v Speaker 3>just crazy inches on top of inches.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one ever writes a.</v>

3138
02:20:54.290 --> 02:20:56.870
<v Speaker 3>This is the close range stag that I shot</v>
<v Speaker 3>in New Zealand.</v>

3139
02:20:57.410 --> 02:20:58.850
<v Speaker 3>No one ever writes out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're just like,</v>

3140
02:20:58.851 --> 02:20:59.684
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got a big red stag and I Blah Blah </v>

3141
02:21:00.621 --> 02:21:01.454
<v Speaker 3>Blah and so many hunters that that </v>
<v Speaker 3>aren't educated in that sense and I'm </v>

3142
02:21:05.451 --> 02:21:07.160
<v Speaker 3>not having a stab at them from not being</v>
<v Speaker 3>educated.</v>

3143
02:21:07.160 --> 02:21:09.980
<v Speaker 3>They shouldn't have to be in that sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Looking at that cow and all that.</v>

3144
02:21:09.981 --> 02:21:13.100
<v Speaker 3>That's what you can expect when you go </v>
<v Speaker 3>to New Zealand or Australia.</v>

3145
02:21:13.340 --> 02:21:17.420
<v Speaker 3>Now it's frigging they append animals </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they feed them high protein,</v>

3146
02:21:17.900 --> 02:21:21.050
<v Speaker 3>high protein food there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've been genetically bred.</v>

3147
02:21:21.470 --> 02:21:22.303
<v Speaker 3>It's just all that crazy shit that's the</v>
<v Speaker 3>fight currency of a red stag in </v>

3148
02:21:26.331 --> 02:21:27.920
<v Speaker 3>Australia and New Zealand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>free range,</v>

3149
02:21:27.921 --> 02:21:28.754
<v Speaker 3>red stags on like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you should afraid Ryan's red stag </v>

3150
02:21:30.471 --> 02:21:33.740
<v Speaker 3>like that in Australia and New Zealand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's going to be the record.</v>

3151
02:21:34.390 --> 02:21:37.220
<v Speaker 3>That's going to be the absolute record.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not the true.</v>

3152
02:21:37.940 --> 02:21:38.773
<v Speaker 3>That's not the example of what you can </v>
<v Speaker 3>expect if you come to Australia or New </v>

3153
02:21:42.020 --> 02:21:43.960
<v Speaker 3>Zealand and hunt free range.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that the.</v>

3154
02:21:43.980 --> 02:21:44.813
<v Speaker 3>That's the difference between free range</v>
<v Speaker 3>and fair chase and these high fence </v>

3155
02:21:48.831 --> 02:21:53.480
<v Speaker 3>operations and it's very.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a very contentious argument because</v>

3156
02:21:53.810 --> 02:21:57.820
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people growing these white tail</v>
<v Speaker 3>deer in America and they're,</v>

3157
02:21:57.830 --> 02:21:58.663
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're introducing this crazy foods to </v>

3158
02:21:59.760 --> 02:22:00.593
<v Speaker 3>their diet and they're growing these </v>
<v Speaker 3>ridiculous racks that don't even look </v>

3159
02:22:03.141 --> 02:22:06.800
<v Speaker 3>like racks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like bushes growing out of their hat and</v>

3160
02:22:06.801 --> 02:22:08.030
<v Speaker 3>they looked so fake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3161
02:22:08.031 --> 02:22:10.850
<v Speaker 3>I don't think they're ugly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They are ugly joy looking at it.</v>

3162
02:22:10.851 --> 02:22:13.090
<v Speaker 3>I don't enjoy looking at it either.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It looks weird.</v>

3163
02:22:13.100 --> 02:22:13.933
<v Speaker 3>It's like some sort of a strange weird </v>
<v Speaker 3>bred dog or something like when you see </v>

3164
02:22:18.230 --> 02:22:21.290
<v Speaker 3>their antlers and you know there are 290</v>
<v Speaker 3>inch white tails,</v>

3165
02:22:21.291 --> 02:22:22.124
<v Speaker 3>like what is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It should because hunting should be so </v>

3166
02:22:24.591 --> 02:22:26.130
<v Speaker 3>natural and that's so far</v>

3167
02:22:26.130 --> 02:22:27.990
<v Speaker 1>from being natural,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially when it's wildlife.</v>

3168
02:22:28.020 --> 02:22:28.853
<v Speaker 1>Not talking about walking around with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>stick and a string that you've carved </v>

3169
02:22:30.781 --> 02:22:31.614
<v Speaker 1>out of a tree yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about just a natural </v>

3170
02:22:34.351 --> 02:22:36.690
<v Speaker 1>environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Landscape and animal.</v>

3171
02:22:36.940 --> 02:22:39.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well animals that are living in the wild</v>

3172
02:22:40.190 --> 02:22:41.023
<v Speaker 1>literally no interaction with people </v>
<v Speaker 1>other than when the hunter and </v>

3173
02:22:43.460 --> 02:22:44.293
<v Speaker 1>especially what you're dealing with </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're dealing with very few </v>

3174
02:22:46.711 --> 02:22:51.600
<v Speaker 1>hunters and like expansive areas where </v>
<v Speaker 1>very few people even go into.</v>

3175
02:22:51.650 --> 02:22:52.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3176
02:22:52.420 --> 02:22:54.510
<v Speaker 1>And I don't muck around and they see you</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're gone like that.</v>

3177
02:22:54.511 --> 02:22:55.680
<v Speaker 1>There's no like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3178
02:22:55.681 --> 02:22:59.310
<v Speaker 1>that's what that dude might have food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nice pocket over there.</v>

3179
02:22:59.320 --> 02:23:00.240
<v Speaker 1>No feed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

3180
02:23:00.600 --> 02:23:01.380
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

3181
02:23:01.380 --> 02:23:02.213
<v Speaker 1>The goal is another big issue in America</v>
<v Speaker 1>where they have these feeders and these </v>

3182
02:23:06.811 --> 02:23:09.760
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they put a blind outside of a feeder and</v>

3183
02:23:09.780 --> 02:23:10.613
<v Speaker 1>the feeder goes off at a certain time </v>
<v Speaker 1>and these people sit in the blind and </v>

3184
02:23:13.171 --> 02:23:16.530
<v Speaker 1>wait for the feeder go off because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>near program to come towards the feet or</v>

3185
02:23:16.531 --> 02:23:17.970
<v Speaker 1>when it's going off and you just whack </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

3186
02:23:18.060 --> 02:23:20.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not interested in that myself,</v>

3187
02:23:20.011 --> 02:23:21.810
<v Speaker 1>but I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't frown upon it.</v>

3188
02:23:21.930 --> 02:23:23.510
<v Speaker 1>Like they call it biting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3189
02:23:23.760 --> 02:23:26.610
<v Speaker 1>Well what it is is it's like meat </v>
<v Speaker 1>acquisition.</v>

3190
02:23:26.670 --> 02:23:28.050
<v Speaker 1>It's not really hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3191
02:23:28.051 --> 02:23:28.884
<v Speaker 1>it's probably better for the animal and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they have put the effort in that set </v>

3192
02:23:31.531 --> 02:23:34.100
<v Speaker 1>that up right and true about animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a little bit like,</v>

3193
02:23:34.230 --> 02:23:35.910
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not my style of hunting,</v>

3194
02:23:35.911 --> 02:23:39.510
<v Speaker 1>but that is the free range thing really </v>
<v Speaker 1>gets me.</v>

3195
02:23:39.511 --> 02:23:41.970
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to go on about it because </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to upset too many people,</v>

3196
02:23:41.971 --> 02:23:42.804
<v Speaker 1>but I know what you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but think about what you were saying </v>

3197
02:23:44.581 --> 02:23:46.410
<v Speaker 1>earlier about your experience in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Montana.</v>

3198
02:23:46.630 --> 02:23:47.321
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3199
02:23:47.321 --> 02:23:51.270
<v Speaker 1>11 days in 12 miles deep into the woods </v>
<v Speaker 1>by yourself.</v>

3200
02:23:51.480 --> 02:23:52.700
<v Speaker 1>That's the real deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3201
02:23:53.000 --> 02:23:55.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that is as real as it gets.</v>

3202
02:23:55.380 --> 02:23:57.340
<v Speaker 1>But this a thing about hunting where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3203
02:23:57.360 --> 02:23:58.193
<v Speaker 1>people that are really into bowhunting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look down on people that shoot with a </v>

3204
02:24:00.331 --> 02:24:01.140
<v Speaker 1>rifle.</v>

3205
02:24:01.140 --> 02:24:04.620
<v Speaker 1>People that are really into wilderness </v>
<v Speaker 1>hunting and fair chase.</v>

3206
02:24:04.621 --> 02:24:06.540
<v Speaker 1>Look down on people that hunt high </v>
<v Speaker 1>fence.</v>

3207
02:24:06.541 --> 02:24:09.720
<v Speaker 1>And I a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get the arguments.</v>

3208
02:24:09.760 --> 02:24:10.593
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I even get the arguments for some high </v>

3209
02:24:11.701 --> 02:24:12.534
<v Speaker 1>fence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like friend of mine went to this high </v>

3210
02:24:13.861 --> 02:24:17.010
<v Speaker 1>fence operation and taxes and I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

3211
02:24:17.011 --> 02:24:17.844
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that seems kind of crazy that these </v>

3212
02:24:18.541 --> 02:24:19.680
<v Speaker 1>animals are all pending.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

3213
02:24:19.681 --> 02:24:21.540
<v Speaker 1>it's 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>acres.</v>

3214
02:24:22.020 --> 02:24:23.340
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>defense circles,</v>

3215
02:24:23.370 --> 02:24:24.630
<v Speaker 1>10,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>acres.</v>

3216
02:24:24.631 --> 02:24:25.800
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they put their on.</v>

3217
02:24:26.090 --> 02:24:29.610
<v Speaker 1>Well the genetical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their access deer and all sorts of fun.</v>

3218
02:24:30.060 --> 02:24:34.050
<v Speaker 1>Like Neil guy and all sorts of weird and</v>
<v Speaker 1>foreign species.</v>

3219
02:24:34.051 --> 02:24:34.471
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3220
02:24:34.471 --> 02:24:36.990
<v Speaker 1>they have been put there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're,</v>

3221
02:24:37.080 --> 02:24:39.300
<v Speaker 1>they're wild.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're Roman wild.</v>

3222
02:24:39.301 --> 02:24:40.140
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh man,</v>

3223
02:24:40.141 --> 02:24:42.300
<v Speaker 1>that's a weird argument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then because I get it.</v>

3224
02:24:42.390 --> 02:24:45.930
<v Speaker 1>I mean like I'm not totally like if I </v>
<v Speaker 1>needed to hunt for meat,</v>

3225
02:24:46.260 --> 02:24:47.070
<v Speaker 1>it's a good way to do it.</v>

3226
02:24:47.070 --> 02:24:49.020
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if it's only a few hundred acres,</v>

3227
02:24:49.021 --> 02:24:50.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the animals are there,</v>

3228
02:24:50.040 --> 02:24:51.600
<v Speaker 1>you just go find them and get them for </v>
<v Speaker 1>meat.</v>

3229
02:24:52.650 --> 02:24:54.180
<v Speaker 1>But even if it's 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>acres,</v>

3230
02:24:54.240 --> 02:24:58.770
<v Speaker 1>at what range is it really wild?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it wild at 50,000</v>

3231
02:24:58.771 --> 02:25:01.500
<v Speaker 1>acres?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it wired into wild at 100,000</v>

3232
02:25:01.501 --> 02:25:03.120
<v Speaker 1>acres?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if it's fenced in,</v>

3233
02:25:03.121 --> 02:25:06.840
<v Speaker 1>if there's a fence anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For me it's just gotta be unfenced fence</v>

3234
02:25:06.841 --> 02:25:08.580
<v Speaker 1>period.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when I went to Africa,</v>

3235
02:25:08.970 --> 02:25:09.803
<v Speaker 1>I've got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got pretty stitched up when I went </v>

3236
02:25:10.920 --> 02:25:13.170
<v Speaker 1>to Africa and it was because it's just </v>
<v Speaker 1>like an operation,</v>

3237
02:25:13.171 --> 02:25:16.050
<v Speaker 1>it's just an income for him stitched up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean by that?</v>

3238
02:25:16.260 --> 02:25:18.300
<v Speaker 1>Stitched up fucked over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

3239
02:25:18.330 --> 02:25:20.520
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the outfit of there,</v>

3240
02:25:20.550 --> 02:25:22.380
<v Speaker 1>like he was just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was a con artist,</v>

3241
02:25:22.381 --> 02:25:24.200
<v Speaker 1>bicycling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

3242
02:25:24.730 --> 02:25:25.563
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to go into too much detail,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but so all is supposed to go straight </v>

3243
02:25:27.911 --> 02:25:29.920
<v Speaker 2>into the Zimbabwean hunt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Buffalo,</v>

3244
02:25:29.921 --> 02:25:33.040
<v Speaker 2>Cape Buffalo and those are dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3245
02:25:33.041 --> 02:25:34.480
<v Speaker 2>Before I got there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he took me to,</v>

3246
02:25:34.481 --> 02:25:35.314
<v Speaker 2>he's like call them branches or whatever</v>
<v Speaker 2>there and it's all that means is high </v>

3247
02:25:39.131 --> 02:25:39.964
<v Speaker 2>fence operation in the South Africa and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I understand parts of South Africa </v>

3248
02:25:43.031 --> 02:25:43.864
<v Speaker 2>because it has bred animals that are on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the brink of extinction and then it's </v>

3249
02:25:48.581 --> 02:25:51.400
<v Speaker 2>good for them because they're there now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's just not familiar me that close</v>

3250
02:25:51.401 --> 02:25:53.350
<v Speaker 2>range hunting and everything's closed </v>
<v Speaker 2>range,</v>

3251
02:25:53.470 --> 02:25:54.303
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>

3252
02:25:54.780 --> 02:25:55.613
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I absolutely hated it because I just </v>

3253
02:25:56.741 --> 02:25:58.480
<v Speaker 2>want an animal that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

3254
02:25:58.660 --> 02:26:01.470
<v Speaker 2>that's there naturally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3255
02:26:01.780 --> 02:26:05.620
<v Speaker 2>or has not been genetically bred or </v>
<v Speaker 2>brought in or anything like that.</v>

3256
02:26:05.621 --> 02:26:07.870
<v Speaker 2>And before I got there these guys were </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3257
02:26:07.871 --> 02:26:11.180
<v Speaker 2>what size buffalo do you want to shoot?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

3258
02:26:11.181 --> 02:26:12.014
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll just see what the big for the </v>

3259
02:26:12.641 --> 02:26:13.300
<v Speaker 2>area.</v>

3260
02:26:13.300 --> 02:26:14.133
<v Speaker 2>Like that's all you can do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can only shoot the big animal for </v>

3261
02:26:15.791 --> 02:26:16.624
<v Speaker 2>the area if you're after an old animal </v>
<v Speaker 2>or a trophy and we can't shoot what's </v>

3262
02:26:18.851 --> 02:26:21.730
<v Speaker 2>big for that area.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So usually I spend the first half of the</v>

3263
02:26:21.731 --> 02:26:25.540
<v Speaker 2>trip understanding what's a big animal </v>
<v Speaker 2>or an old animal for the area.</v>

3264
02:26:26.230 --> 02:26:27.880
<v Speaker 2>Then you'll have it for the other half </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the trip.</v>

3265
02:26:28.510 --> 02:26:29.590
<v Speaker 2>They like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what size?</v>

3266
02:26:29.591 --> 02:26:31.300
<v Speaker 2>Buffalo do you want to shoot?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3267
02:26:31.850 --> 02:26:33.850
<v Speaker 2>let's just say what's big for the area.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh No,</v>

3268
02:26:33.851 --> 02:26:36.580
<v Speaker 2>we'll just bring one in on truck before </v>
<v Speaker 2>you get here.</v>

3269
02:26:36.581 --> 02:26:39.010
<v Speaker 2>You just tell us what size you want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll bring it in and release it.</v>

3270
02:26:39.250 --> 02:26:42.040
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I'm going to do that,</v>

3271
02:26:42.041 --> 02:26:45.310
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to go to a farm and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can I buy that cow and cut it up for me?</v>

3272
02:26:46.050 --> 02:26:47.620
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

3273
02:26:47.720 --> 02:26:49.740
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's a little bit on,</v>

3274
02:26:49.910 --> 02:26:52.700
<v Speaker 2>on lease that operation in South Africa.</v>

3275
02:26:52.700 --> 02:26:54.940
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying they're all like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of them like that.</v>

3276
02:26:54.970 --> 02:26:55.803
<v Speaker 2>There is a lot of them like that and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then I end up paying extra because I'm </v>

3277
02:26:59.341 --> 02:26:59.850
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3278
02:26:59.850 --> 02:27:00.683
<v Speaker 2>if I've got a hunt free range,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the only way I'm going to hunt and </v>

3279
02:27:03.670 --> 02:27:06.880
<v Speaker 2>that's what I was coming here for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>100 free range a Cape Buffalo.</v>

3280
02:27:07.570 --> 02:27:10.960
<v Speaker 2>Then we ended up in Mozambique in </v>
<v Speaker 2>another place where we didn't say a bowl</v>

3281
02:27:10.961 --> 02:27:14.110
<v Speaker 2>for 10 days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The outfitter,</v>

3282
02:27:14.111 --> 02:27:16.990
<v Speaker 2>he'd never been to that place or or he'd</v>
<v Speaker 2>never taken a.</v>

3283
02:27:16.991 --> 02:27:18.460
<v Speaker 2>have a hunters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are or anything like that.</v>

3284
02:27:18.461 --> 02:27:22.150
<v Speaker 2>And I got there and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the whole time he was like,</v>

3285
02:27:22.151 --> 02:27:22.890
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3286
02:27:22.890 --> 02:27:24.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a real good area.</v>

3287
02:27:24.551 --> 02:27:25.384
<v Speaker 2>You'll tag are straight away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You will see hundreds of buffalo every </v>

3288
02:27:27.580 --> 02:27:28.210
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like I said,</v>

3289
02:27:28.210 --> 02:27:29.970
<v Speaker 2>10 days later we hadn't even seen a </v>
<v Speaker 2>book.</v>

3290
02:27:30.520 --> 02:27:31.540
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3291
02:27:32.150 --> 02:27:32.760
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

3292
02:27:32.760 --> 02:27:33.470
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

3293
02:27:33.470 --> 02:27:36.640
<v Speaker 2>it's a horrible industry over there in </v>
<v Speaker 2>that sense.</v>

3294
02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:38.260
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an,</v>

3295
02:27:38.261 --> 02:27:39.094
<v Speaker 2>it couldn't be a blame as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I should've done more research on that </v>

3296
02:27:41.640 --> 02:27:42.970
<v Speaker 2>outfitter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3297
02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:43.833
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I won that hunt for a charity </v>

3298
02:27:45.011 --> 02:27:45.844
<v Speaker 2>auction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't the sort of thing that I was </v>

3299
02:27:47.111 --> 02:27:48.010
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3300
02:27:48.280 --> 02:27:49.113
<v Speaker 2>research and for weeks and weeks trying </v>
<v Speaker 2>to find a good outfit or to go through </v>

3301
02:27:52.081 --> 02:27:54.890
<v Speaker 2>and shoot a Cape Buffalo so that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was speed.</v>

3302
02:27:54.940 --> 02:27:55.773
<v Speaker 2>Unfortunately.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

3303
02:27:55.880 --> 02:27:56.713
<v Speaker 1>There's an amazing documentary on it </v>
<v Speaker 1>from Louis Theroux who's a wildlife or </v>

3304
02:28:00.890 --> 02:28:04.910
<v Speaker 1>rather a documentary in from the UK.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Great Guy who,</v>

3305
02:28:04.911 --> 02:28:06.860
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's been on the podcast a couple times</v>

3306
02:28:06.861 --> 02:28:09.380
<v Speaker 1>and talked about it the first time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

3307
02:28:09.410 --> 02:28:13.430
<v Speaker 1>it's all about these African high fence </v>
<v Speaker 1>hunting trips.</v>

3308
02:28:13.550 --> 02:28:14.383
<v Speaker 1>And he was over there for a long time </v>
<v Speaker 1>and got the guy to kind of explain </v>

3309
02:28:17.570 --> 02:28:21.200
<v Speaker 1>exactly what's going on over there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was just really bizarre.</v>

3310
02:28:21.320 --> 02:28:22.100
<v Speaker 1>See people,</v>

3311
02:28:22.100 --> 02:28:22.933
<v Speaker 3>you know they're there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They had these lions and they had them </v>

3312
02:28:26.710 --> 02:28:28.350
<v Speaker 3>like right there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there were,</v>

3313
02:28:28.400 --> 02:28:29.233
<v Speaker 3>there was two cents of fences,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one fence and the fence right behind it </v>

3314
02:28:31.400 --> 02:28:32.233
<v Speaker 3>and they took a dead calf and they throw</v>
<v Speaker 3>it over the fence and then watch the </v>

3315
02:28:34.251 --> 02:28:35.084
<v Speaker 3>lions tear it apart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you're looking at the lines of </v>

3316
02:28:37.020 --> 02:28:38.690
<v Speaker 3>looking at the people you can go hunt </v>
<v Speaker 3>those lines.</v>

3317
02:28:38.691 --> 02:28:40.300
<v Speaker 3>They just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just let one loose,</v>

3318
02:28:40.330 --> 02:28:42.200
<v Speaker 3>they take it out and it's all high </v>
<v Speaker 3>fence.</v>

3319
02:28:42.620 --> 02:28:43.453
<v Speaker 3>But they were explaining that these </v>
<v Speaker 3>animals were on the verge of extinction </v>

3320
02:28:45.920 --> 02:28:46.753
<v Speaker 3>just a few decades ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And because of these high fence </v>

3321
02:28:48.951 --> 02:28:50.510
<v Speaker 3>operations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now they're thriving.</v>

3322
02:28:50.690 --> 02:28:51.523
<v Speaker 3>But they're thriving in these bizarre </v>
<v Speaker 3>conditions where they're fenced in and </v>

3323
02:28:55.910 --> 02:28:59.090
<v Speaker 3>put them in the wallet and let them fry </v>
<v Speaker 3>out there in that area.</v>

3324
02:28:59.180 --> 02:29:00.950
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then there's the poaching thing.</v>

3325
02:29:01.250 --> 02:29:02.083
<v Speaker 3>Poaching is a weird word for it because </v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of those people just hunting for </v>

3326
02:29:04.131 --> 02:29:04.964
<v Speaker 3>food for people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the villages that I went for because </v>

3327
02:29:08.600 --> 02:29:12.710
<v Speaker 3>we'd find snares and and I'd rip them </v>
<v Speaker 3>down and it wasn't,</v>

3328
02:29:13.080 --> 02:29:16.340
<v Speaker 3>wasn't the commercial side of poaching.</v>

3329
02:29:16.340 --> 02:29:17.173
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't locked out collecting the </v>
<v Speaker 3>antlers or ivy or whatever and selling </v>

3330
02:29:19.941 --> 02:29:21.380
<v Speaker 3>it and getting massive amounts of </v>
<v Speaker 3>dollars.</v>

3331
02:29:21.710 --> 02:29:25.610
<v Speaker 3>These were people that were snaring to </v>
<v Speaker 3>try and catch animals to eight.</v>

3332
02:29:26.260 --> 02:29:27.093
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I'm gone broke and my family is </v>

3333
02:29:28.431 --> 02:29:29.480
<v Speaker 3>hungry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to be the first one.</v>

3334
02:29:29.481 --> 02:29:30.314
<v Speaker 3>The fucking step over a fence and killed</v>
<v Speaker 3>something I can tell you right now </v>

3335
02:29:32.570 --> 02:29:34.040
<v Speaker 3>because I know I'm doing the right </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

3336
02:29:34.310 --> 02:29:35.700
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so there's,</v>

3337
02:29:35.810 --> 02:29:36.643
<v Speaker 3>there's a funny line there where where </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a couple of different types of </v>

3338
02:29:39.231 --> 02:29:40.280
<v Speaker 3>poaching,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3339
02:29:40.281 --> 02:29:42.860
<v Speaker 3>and it's that one that's commercial and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they just slowed her and everything.</v>

3340
02:29:42.890 --> 02:29:45.230
<v Speaker 3>Elephants,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lionel Hollins,</v>

3341
02:29:45.290 --> 02:29:48.580
<v Speaker 3>which freaking horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then there's the villager,</v>

3342
02:29:48.980 --> 02:29:51.020
<v Speaker 3>let's just call them locals because I </v>
<v Speaker 3>lived there.</v>

3343
02:29:51.310 --> 02:29:53.900
<v Speaker 3>It should be there land for people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

3344
02:29:53.901 --> 02:29:56.360
<v Speaker 3>They just trying to feed their family,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

3345
02:29:56.361 --> 02:29:58.160
<v Speaker 3>I come.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no heightened that.</v>

3346
02:29:58.340 --> 02:29:59.173
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no hate night and those people </v>

3347
02:30:00.081 --> 02:30:00.914
<v Speaker 3>are shot.</v>

3348
02:30:00.980 --> 02:30:01.813
<v Speaker 3>They shoot the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's scary shit that is dead in </v>

3349
02:30:06.201 --> 02:30:07.034
<v Speaker 3>South Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but goddamn racism is still real strong </v>

3350
02:30:09.741 --> 02:30:10.574
<v Speaker 3>and a lot of areas there and those </v>
<v Speaker 3>people that are just poor black people </v>

3351
02:30:13.101 --> 02:30:13.934
<v Speaker 3>that live there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the other thing that I hide in </v>

3352
02:30:14.971 --> 02:30:15.804
<v Speaker 3>the back of the hunt dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the man and the people that I was with </v>

3353
02:30:18.470 --> 02:30:21.860
<v Speaker 3>frigging rice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like I come back from that trip and</v>

3354
02:30:21.861 --> 02:30:24.530
<v Speaker 3>talking to Kim about it and all choked </v>
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>

3355
02:30:24.531 --> 02:30:25.364
<v Speaker 3>I started crying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't believe what those people have </v>

3356
02:30:26.631 --> 02:30:30.800
<v Speaker 3>to go through over there and now the </v>
<v Speaker 3>paper that will help me on the hunt.</v>

3357
02:30:30.801 --> 02:30:34.490
<v Speaker 3>That was small and now that will happy </v>
<v Speaker 3>the whole time and he his these paypal's</v>

3358
02:30:34.491 --> 02:30:38.440
<v Speaker 3>saying he would kill his own mother for </v>
<v Speaker 3>the scraps from the table.</v>

3359
02:30:38.510 --> 02:30:39.343
<v Speaker 3>Unlike had.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How can you frigging say that day you </v>

3360
02:30:41.601 --> 02:30:43.190
<v Speaker 3>say that you don't know that person?</v>

3361
02:30:43.790 --> 02:30:48.380
<v Speaker 3>That's how that is deeply ingrained </v>
<v Speaker 3>generation after generation.</v>

3362
02:30:48.440 --> 02:30:51.710
<v Speaker 3>I love the local people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I hated the outfit that I was with.</v>

3363
02:30:51.860 --> 02:30:53.360
<v Speaker 3>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's disturbing.</v>

3364
02:30:53.370 --> 02:30:55.190
<v Speaker 3>And it's just sad that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3365
02:30:55.191 --> 02:30:56.024
<v Speaker 3>how do you ever fix that and you know </v>
<v Speaker 3>what's really crazy is for a lot of </v>

3366
02:31:00.141 --> 02:31:03.650
<v Speaker 3>people that's their dream to go to </v>
<v Speaker 3>Africa and hunt the big seven,</v>

3367
02:31:03.651 --> 02:31:05.430
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are the big five or or there's,</v>

3368
02:31:05.730 --> 02:31:06.420
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>

3369
02:31:06.420 --> 02:31:11.060
<v Speaker 3>there's a movement of people acquiring </v>
<v Speaker 3>all these trophies going into Africa and</v>

3370
02:31:11.061 --> 02:31:13.310
<v Speaker 3>shooting all these different animals and</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the way they do it.</v>

3371
02:31:13.311 --> 02:31:16.670
<v Speaker 3>They go to these outfitters that can </v>
<v Speaker 3>guarantee they can get in front of these</v>

3372
02:31:16.671 --> 02:31:17.504
<v Speaker 3>animals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you've just got to do your </v>

3373
02:31:18.960 --> 02:31:20.210
<v Speaker 3>research on outfitters.</v>

3374
02:31:20.340 --> 02:31:22.770
<v Speaker 2>Let's run with a scumbag ones out of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>industry.</v>

3375
02:31:23.100 --> 02:31:23.933
<v Speaker 2>Do your research on the the outfit or </v>
<v Speaker 2>talk to other hunters that have been </v>

3376
02:31:26.521 --> 02:31:27.354
<v Speaker 2>there like and not just one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Talked to six other hunters that have </v>

3377
02:31:29.341 --> 02:31:33.450
<v Speaker 2>been at operation demand for the numbers</v>
<v Speaker 2>or the emails for who their past clients</v>

3378
02:31:34.140 --> 02:31:34.973
<v Speaker 2>and go there straight doesn't have that </v>
<v Speaker 2>stray as built a hunting industry which </v>

3379
02:31:39.451 --> 02:31:40.590
<v Speaker 2>is tiny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

3380
02:31:40.710 --> 02:31:42.420
<v Speaker 2>have you ever heard about hunting in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Australia?</v>

3381
02:31:42.421 --> 02:31:42.760
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

3382
02:31:42.760 --> 02:31:43.593
<v Speaker 2>come to Australia and shooter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever species of deer you don't </v>

3383
02:31:46.651 --> 02:31:47.484
<v Speaker 2>because it's not that big.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like New Zealand or it's not </v>

3384
02:31:50.010 --> 02:31:52.320
<v Speaker 2>like Africa where they build a big </v>
<v Speaker 2>industry on it.</v>

3385
02:31:52.470 --> 02:31:56.520
<v Speaker 2>It's not a New Zealand gets over like A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

3386
02:31:56.521 --> 02:31:58.780
<v Speaker 2>They must have the right people or </v>
<v Speaker 2>government pushing it at.</v>

3387
02:31:58.810 --> 02:32:02.430
<v Speaker 2>Some people are always trying out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>New Zealand's known for it.</v>

3388
02:32:02.431 --> 02:32:03.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>beautiful country.</v>

3389
02:32:03.751 --> 02:32:04.584
<v Speaker 2>Awesome.</v>

3390
02:32:04.920 --> 02:32:05.753
<v Speaker 2>But I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Australia's industry is built on having </v>

3391
02:32:09.270 --> 02:32:12.360
<v Speaker 2>excellent access to excellent numbers of</v>
<v Speaker 2>game.</v>

3392
02:32:12.720 --> 02:32:14.940
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you book a hunt in Australia,</v>

3393
02:32:15.420 --> 02:32:16.980
<v Speaker 2>it's not like someone's gone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3394
02:32:17.070 --> 02:32:20.970
<v Speaker 2>there's a big industry here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so let's just make up a business,</v>

3395
02:32:21.240 --> 02:32:24.810
<v Speaker 2>a Australian hunton safaris and let's </v>
<v Speaker 2>just get people in.</v>

3396
02:32:24.840 --> 02:32:26.910
<v Speaker 2>We don't have game,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're going to come anyway because</v>

3397
02:32:26.911 --> 02:32:30.090
<v Speaker 2>we're known for hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You book a hunt in Australia,</v>

3398
02:32:30.091 --> 02:32:30.924
<v Speaker 2>I guarantee you're going to be at a </v>
<v Speaker 2>place as long as you do a little bit of </v>

3399
02:32:33.151 --> 02:32:33.984
<v Speaker 2>research,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but practically everywhere has big game </v>

3400
02:32:36.421 --> 02:32:40.810
<v Speaker 2>numbers and that's why they've started </v>
<v Speaker 2>the business on a hunting outfit because</v>

3401
02:32:40.811 --> 02:32:41.920
<v Speaker 2>they've got so much game and they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3402
02:32:41.940 --> 02:32:42.810
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is.</v>

3403
02:32:42.920 --> 02:32:44.910
<v Speaker 2>This could work out really good for </v>
<v Speaker 2>hunters.</v>

3404
02:32:44.911 --> 02:32:49.911
<v Speaker 2>There's a ton of game here come along.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's not like that in Africa,</v>

3405
02:32:50.630 --> 02:32:51.463
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of those places have really got </v>

3406
02:32:52.561 --> 02:32:54.470
<v Speaker 2>nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3407
02:32:54.540 --> 02:32:55.373
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

3408
02:32:55.390 --> 02:32:58.470
<v Speaker 2>it's arid lands and federal is bullshit.</v>

3409
02:32:58.470 --> 02:33:00.040
<v Speaker 2>That hunting is going to be unreal and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

3410
02:33:00.150 --> 02:33:03.150
<v Speaker 2>and it's not at all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is what I experienced now,</v>

3411
02:33:03.151 --> 02:33:03.984
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many people who are willing to do </v>

3412
02:33:05.191 --> 02:33:08.830
<v Speaker 2>something like what you did in Montana </v>
<v Speaker 2>or what you and cam did in Australia was</v>

3413
02:33:08.831 --> 02:33:09.664
<v Speaker 2>just probably even crazier because you </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't even bring anything with you </v>

3414
02:33:11.850 --> 02:33:13.260
<v Speaker 2>while you have to predicate bringing </v>
<v Speaker 2>that up.</v>

3415
02:33:14.430 --> 02:33:16.110
<v Speaker 2>You guys survived off the land.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3416
02:33:16.111 --> 02:33:18.220
<v Speaker 2>that's how many days before I can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

3417
02:33:18.270 --> 02:33:19.860
<v Speaker 2>I just want to feel something up about </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

3418
02:33:20.520 --> 02:33:21.353
<v Speaker 2>The helicopter pilots said you've got to</v>
<v Speaker 2>keep your gear basically to a backpack </v>

3419
02:33:25.621 --> 02:33:29.640
<v Speaker 2>hunt because the chopper couldn't carry </v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of weight.</v>

3420
02:33:30.210 --> 02:33:30.840
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3421
02:33:30.840 --> 02:33:32.130
<v Speaker 2>so then I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3422
02:33:32.190 --> 02:33:33.023
<v Speaker 2>I can't pack a lot of food because I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>already at my white limit cams already </v>

3423
02:33:35.911 --> 02:33:36.900
<v Speaker 2>at ease,</v>
<v Speaker 2>white limit.</v>

3424
02:33:37.290 --> 02:33:38.123
<v Speaker 2>Nobody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Body islands already yet kind of be at </v>

3425
02:33:39.211 --> 02:33:40.080
<v Speaker 2>his white limit.</v>

3426
02:33:40.680 --> 02:33:41.513
<v Speaker 2>So I simply couldn't really pack food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't pack fresh water or anything </v>

3427
02:33:44.401 --> 02:33:45.234
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because the chopper actually struggled </v>

3428
02:33:46.860 --> 02:33:51.860
<v Speaker 2>to get off the ground once it was filled</v>
<v Speaker 2>up and so that's the story about it.</v>

3429
02:33:53.041 --> 02:33:55.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But those folks won't tell you that part</v>

3430
02:33:55.471 --> 02:33:56.940
<v Speaker 2>of the story that might be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

3431
02:33:56.941 --> 02:33:58.860
<v Speaker 2>we couldn't take food because the </v>
<v Speaker 2>chopper couldn't carry.</v>

3432
02:33:58.861 --> 02:34:00.510
<v Speaker 2>They always look at them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't bring any food,</v>

3433
02:34:00.910 --> 02:34:03.990
<v Speaker 2>any responsible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Way Cam described it was like,</v>

3434
02:34:03.991 --> 02:34:06.720
<v Speaker 2>you guys had just made this conscious </v>
<v Speaker 2>decision to try to rough it.</v>

3435
02:34:06.780 --> 02:34:07.613
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that sounds good.</v>

3436
02:34:07.890 --> 02:34:09.580
<v Speaker 2>That sounds better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That stuff.</v>

3437
02:34:09.710 --> 02:34:11.880
<v Speaker 2>It was pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We did because I was like,</v>

3438
02:34:12.070 --> 02:34:14.520
<v Speaker 2>it will be part of the experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll have to catch buffalo,</v>

3439
02:34:14.521 --> 02:34:15.840
<v Speaker 2>will have to kill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to kill,</v>

3440
02:34:16.200 --> 02:34:17.680
<v Speaker 2>come on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

3441
02:34:17.800 --> 02:34:18.633
<v Speaker 2>and we did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that the buffalo that were killed </v>

3442
02:34:20.680 --> 02:34:22.990
<v Speaker 2>was so tough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it might've been cans.</v>

3443
02:34:23.000 --> 02:34:26.590
<v Speaker 2>First bullet he killed was so tough that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just chewed the meat.</v>

3444
02:34:26.950 --> 02:34:29.830
<v Speaker 2>You got the liquid out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you had to take the meat out of</v>

3445
02:34:29.831 --> 02:34:31.420
<v Speaker 2>your mouth because you couldn't break it</v>
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>

3446
02:34:32.370 --> 02:34:34.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was an old bull,</v>

3447
02:34:34.370 --> 02:34:35.203
<v Speaker 2>a [inaudible] book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He told me that he was practicing with </v>

3448
02:34:37.901 --> 02:34:41.920
<v Speaker 2>his bow with the same piece of meat in </v>
<v Speaker 2>his mouth for 30 minutes.</v>

3449
02:34:41.921 --> 02:34:45.730
<v Speaker 2>That sounds about right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What about the liver?</v>

3450
02:34:45.760 --> 02:34:46.840
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>couldn't you eat the liver?</v>

3451
02:34:47.230 --> 02:34:49.030
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we could off.</v>

3452
02:34:49.031 --> 02:34:52.380
<v Speaker 2>You'd want to check it over it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most of Australians strikes,</v>

3453
02:34:52.390 --> 02:34:54.320
<v Speaker 2>bases and game the disease.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Furry,</v>

3454
02:34:54.330 --> 02:34:55.660
<v Speaker 2>like that's one of the beauties in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Australia.</v>

3455
02:34:55.661 --> 02:34:58.810
<v Speaker 2>You can cut the raw meat off any animal </v>
<v Speaker 2>in Australia and just ate it.</v>

3456
02:34:58.811 --> 02:35:01.480
<v Speaker 2>You won't get sick if you do get sick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't blame me,</v>

3457
02:35:01.481 --> 02:35:05.320
<v Speaker 2>but you shouldn't get sick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just like drink a buffalo.</v>

3458
02:35:05.321 --> 02:35:06.580
<v Speaker 2>Piss.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

3459
02:35:06.780 --> 02:35:08.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3460
02:35:08.650 --> 02:35:09.400
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just,</v>

3461
02:35:09.400 --> 02:35:11.230
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just so tough.</v>

3462
02:35:11.410 --> 02:35:14.200
<v Speaker 2>But you didn't eat the liver room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We didn't take it.</v>

3463
02:35:14.201 --> 02:35:15.790
<v Speaker 2>We should have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now that you've said that.</v>

3464
02:35:15.920 --> 02:35:17.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love liver.</v>

3465
02:35:17.250 --> 02:35:19.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

3466
02:35:20.560 --> 02:35:22.330
<v Speaker 2>Touch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't mean he won't eat heart.</v>

3467
02:35:22.331 --> 02:35:23.620
<v Speaker 2>You won't eat liver.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a pussy.</v>

3468
02:35:23.621 --> 02:35:28.380
<v Speaker 2>So he'll run like 200 miles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But why for seven,</v>

3469
02:35:28.390 --> 02:35:31.510
<v Speaker 2>eight hours in a row you to live.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not impressive.</v>

3470
02:35:32.530 --> 02:35:33.850
<v Speaker 2>He just doesn't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess.</v>

3471
02:35:33.851 --> 02:35:34.990
<v Speaker 2>Get a new shirt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dude.</v>

3472
02:35:37.460 --> 02:35:39.760
<v Speaker 2>I just don't understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it tastes delicious,</v>

3473
02:35:39.761 --> 02:35:41.770
<v Speaker 2>but it's also really good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3474
02:35:41.860 --> 02:35:42.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3475
02:35:42.480 --> 02:35:43.313
<v Speaker 2>and it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's some sort of an </v>

3476
02:35:43.901 --> 02:35:45.580
<v Speaker 2>obligation they eat as much of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>animals.</v>

3477
02:35:45.590 --> 02:35:46.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll definitely,</v>

3478
02:35:46.901 --> 02:35:47.734
<v Speaker 2>I'll do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And actually a majestic thing like the </v>

3479
02:35:49.200 --> 02:35:51.670
<v Speaker 2>elk or the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the indigenous population a lot.</v>

3480
02:35:51.671 --> 02:35:54.270
<v Speaker 2>But when we go out there for a hunt </v>
<v Speaker 2>because because that,</v>

3481
02:35:54.350 --> 02:35:57.130
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is free and a half days,</v>

3482
02:35:57.131 --> 02:36:00.430
<v Speaker 2>four days drive from my house to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to go there to go hunting.</v>

3483
02:36:00.930 --> 02:36:02.590
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's hot.</v>

3484
02:36:02.630 --> 02:36:04.580
<v Speaker 2>Take meat that far home,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3485
02:36:04.581 --> 02:36:05.414
<v Speaker 2>w,</v>
<v Speaker 2>w what your,</v>

3486
02:36:05.450 --> 02:36:06.281
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your vehicle,</v>

3487
02:36:06.281 --> 02:36:07.630
<v Speaker 2>if you're in a vehicle is already packed</v>
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>

3488
02:36:07.631 --> 02:36:09.610
<v Speaker 2>And if you did the chopper thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you wouldn't be taking any out.</v>

3489
02:36:09.611 --> 02:36:11.920
<v Speaker 2>You'd have to donate it all to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>indigenous.</v>

3490
02:36:12.370 --> 02:36:13.203
<v Speaker 2>So when we go out for a hunt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love it because we're shooting balls </v>

3491
02:36:15.641 --> 02:36:17.560
<v Speaker 2>and cutting up meat and how do they cook</v>
<v Speaker 2>it?</v>

3492
02:36:19.210 --> 02:36:20.043
<v Speaker 2>No different than any of us were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So how the fuck do they chew through </v>

3493
02:36:21.731 --> 02:36:22.550
<v Speaker 2>that thing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If,</v>

3494
02:36:22.550 --> 02:36:24.100
<v Speaker 2>if they're out on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3495
02:36:24.520 --> 02:36:27.340
<v Speaker 2>if they're out of community,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is like a,</v>

3496
02:36:27.370 --> 02:36:29.300
<v Speaker 2>like an outstation there on the land.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3497
02:36:29.301 --> 02:36:29.950
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

3498
02:36:29.950 --> 02:36:32.000
<v Speaker 2>they're out on the land.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3499
02:36:32.200 --> 02:36:35.290
<v Speaker 2>most indigenous cook just by putting the</v>
<v Speaker 2>meat straight in the fire,</v>

3500
02:36:35.291 --> 02:36:36.700
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>still very traditional way.</v>

3501
02:36:36.701 --> 02:36:37.534
<v Speaker 2>They'd just put the meat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like if I killed a wallaby or </v>

3502
02:36:40.991 --> 02:36:42.530
<v Speaker 2>kangaroo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3503
02:36:42.680 --> 02:36:43.513
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

3504
02:36:43.530 --> 02:36:44.363
<v Speaker 2>they wouldn't get it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they wouldn't scan it or anything that </v>

3505
02:36:46.301 --> 02:36:49.060
<v Speaker 2>front straightened the fire like that </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the skin's like a,</v>

3506
02:36:49.510 --> 02:36:52.070
<v Speaker 2>what would we wrap meat in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like our foil or something like that and</v>

3507
02:36:52.090 --> 02:36:52.923
<v Speaker 2>cook it in the fire like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The skin just acts like that and it </v>

3508
02:36:54.341 --> 02:36:56.500
<v Speaker 2>gives me a lot of flavor and everything </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

3509
02:36:57.000 --> 02:36:59.530
<v Speaker 2>It's just why do we have to complicate </v>
<v Speaker 2>things so much?</v>

3510
02:36:59.560 --> 02:37:01.120
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's put some air foil around it.</v>

3511
02:37:01.121 --> 02:37:03.880
<v Speaker 2>Let's put some spices in there and stuff</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that because it tastes better.</v>

3512
02:37:05.340 --> 02:37:07.560
<v Speaker 2>Taste better because we're so used to </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing that Monday.</v>

3513
02:37:07.561 --> 02:37:08.394
<v Speaker 2>If you'd never done that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we'd never ever done that meat with </v>

3514
02:37:10.920 --> 02:37:11.753
<v Speaker 2>just taste good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just how it is implying maybe or they </v>

3515
02:37:15.321 --> 02:37:16.160
<v Speaker 2>figured out it tastes better</v>

3516
02:37:16.160 --> 02:37:18.830
<v Speaker 3>with salt and pepper and garlic salt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Definitely.</v>

3517
02:37:18.831 --> 02:37:19.664
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's like some spice company </v>

3518
02:37:22.761 --> 02:37:23.594
<v Speaker 3>that's going to go through a indigenous </v>
<v Speaker 3>Australia now given them more spices so </v>

3519
02:37:26.570 --> 02:37:28.790
<v Speaker 3>that they get used to it and they'll get</v>
<v Speaker 3>addicted sales go up.</v>

3520
02:37:29.040 --> 02:37:29.873
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they throw it on the fire without </v>

3521
02:37:31.491 --> 02:37:33.710
<v Speaker 3>gutting it at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then did they eat the guts?</v>

3522
02:37:34.620 --> 02:37:35.453
<v Speaker 3>The guts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just the meat and everything around it </v>

3523
02:37:36.710 --> 02:37:38.450
<v Speaker 3>that would probably eat the organs and </v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

3524
02:37:38.480 --> 02:37:40.100
<v Speaker 3>Same with fish,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just fried fish.</v>

3525
02:37:40.101 --> 02:37:40.934
<v Speaker 3>Straight on the fire.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've done that plenty of times so it's </v>

3526
02:37:41.871 --> 02:37:42.381
<v Speaker 3>good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good.</v>

3527
02:37:42.381 --> 02:37:44.900
<v Speaker 3>Eaten like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so it won't be scaled.</v>

3528
02:37:45.440 --> 02:37:49.430
<v Speaker 3>And the scales act is like the </v>
<v Speaker 3>protective barrier between the ashes and</v>

3529
02:37:49.431 --> 02:37:50.264
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Get into the good meat and cooking the </v>

3530
02:37:51.771 --> 02:37:52.604
<v Speaker 3>fish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Better skills in all the flavor and </v>

3531
02:37:53.961 --> 02:37:54.794
<v Speaker 3>taste and the juices.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Once the fish is cooked then you just </v>

3532
02:37:57.591 --> 02:37:59.540
<v Speaker 3>sort of watching the scale is often as </v>
<v Speaker 3>beautiful,</v>

3533
02:37:59.541 --> 02:38:00.660
<v Speaker 3>clean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>clean,</v>

3534
02:38:00.661 --> 02:38:02.040
<v Speaker 3>flush right there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>

3535
02:38:02.400 --> 02:38:03.970
<v Speaker 3>Hm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hm.</v>

3536
02:38:04.490 --> 02:38:07.130
<v Speaker 3>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never cooked anything on ashes like</v>

3537
02:38:07.131 --> 02:38:09.170
<v Speaker 3>flat on Ashley will before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3538
02:38:09.280 --> 02:38:10.113
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're going to need like a month in </v>

02:38:13.850 --> 02:38:14.770
<v Speaker 3>Oh a month.</v>

<v Speaker 3>It's Australian English.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>They only have a few words they say </v>

3558
02:38:52.161 --> 02:38:53.420
<v Speaker 3>different than us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like a boat.</v>

3562
02:39:02.040 --> 02:39:05.060

<v Speaker 3>Canadians,</v>

3563
02:39:05.061 --> 02:39:06.230
<v Speaker 3>Australians.</v>

3564
02:39:06.310 --> 02:39:07.143
<v Speaker 3>they're pretty polite too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But Canadians are like for North </v>

3565
02:39:09.890 --> 02:39:11.570
<v Speaker 3>America,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're the fucking kings,</v>

3570
02:39:23.390 --> 02:39:25.270

<v Speaker 3>softer spots.</v>

3571
02:39:25.290 --> 02:39:26.780
<v Speaker 3>And you guys lived off for that.</v>

<v Speaker 3>world.</v>

3575
02:39:32.870 --> 02:39:33.730
<v Speaker 3>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Louis?</v>

3577
02:39:35.780 --> 02:39:38.210
<v Speaker 3>We took little fishing rods in and we </v>
<v Speaker 3>took a couple of Lewis.</v>

3578
02:39:38.211 --> 02:39:40.250
<v Speaker 3>Is it a fresh water or salt water fish?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They both.</v>

3579
02:39:40.920 --> 02:39:42.650
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where'd you guys catch them?</v>

3580
02:39:42.870 --> 02:39:43.420
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll,</v>

3581
02:39:43.420 --> 02:39:45.020
<v Speaker 3>we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll can't throw it on the coast.</v>

3582
02:39:45.170 --> 02:39:46.940
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

3583
02:39:47.300 --> 02:39:49.160
<v Speaker 3>it was horrible in a sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was good,</v>

3584
02:39:49.161 --> 02:39:49.994
<v Speaker 3>but it was horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was nice because you'd get a window </v>

3585
02:39:51.141 --> 02:39:51.974
<v Speaker 3>each night but it was horrible because </v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll need a lot of water in a river </v>

3586
02:39:56.390 --> 02:39:58.970
<v Speaker 3>mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the mosquitoes were like,</v>

3587
02:39:58.971 --> 02:40:01.450
<v Speaker 3>as soon as it started getting dark </v>
<v Speaker 3>mosquitoes would be impolite.</v>

3588
02:40:01.460 --> 02:40:02.293
<v Speaker 3>But coalitions like your arms would go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>black comedy mosquitoes if you didn't </v>

3589
02:40:05.901 --> 02:40:07.430
<v Speaker 3>put something on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I said,</v>

3590
02:40:07.431 --> 02:40:08.264
<v Speaker 3>we had to get a lot so I only had one </v>
<v Speaker 3>tiny little tube of like an insect </v>

3591
02:40:11.110 --> 02:40:14.250
<v Speaker 3>repellent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's Ms Dot k dot that brutal</v>

3592
02:40:14.250 --> 02:40:15.780
<v Speaker 2>that you'd put that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

3593
02:40:15.830 --> 02:40:17.580
<v Speaker 2>And they'd stay off for like two </v>
<v Speaker 2>minutes.</v>

3594
02:40:17.610 --> 02:40:20.450
<v Speaker 2>Cam didn't even have a net.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I would sleep.</v>

3595
02:40:20.520 --> 02:40:23.880
<v Speaker 2>I had a hammock and I'd sleep in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>hammock and I had a net of me,</v>

3596
02:40:24.180 --> 02:40:27.360
<v Speaker 2>but my back would just get smashed by </v>
<v Speaker 2>mosquitoes come back.</v>

3597
02:40:27.361 --> 02:40:29.970
<v Speaker 2>She is lying against the net.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No mattress or anything.</v>

3598
02:40:30.510 --> 02:40:32.760
<v Speaker 2>I'd wake up in the morning just </v>
<v Speaker 2>agonizing,</v>

3599
02:40:32.761 --> 02:40:35.280
<v Speaker 2>wanting to scratch and and cam was </v>

<v Speaker 2>it's not even part of the thought </v>

3608
02:40:58.231 --> 02:41:00.960
<v Speaker 2>process in a sense when you're on a hunt</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that because it's just,</v>

3611
02:41:04.560 --> 02:41:06.660
<v Speaker 2>It's a miserable part of the hunt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's just the part of the.</v>

3612
02:41:06.830 --> 02:41:10.280
<v Speaker 2>I don't even like a fly buzzing around </v>
<v Speaker 2>my head when I'm practicing my backyard.</v>

3613
02:41:10.320 --> 02:41:11.153

3614
02:41:15.001 --> 02:41:18.660
<v Speaker 2>corner of my eye and I'll just hold a </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation and people will be like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the water was muddy and it's hard to </v>

3627
02:41:48.151 --> 02:41:48.984
<v Speaker 2>tell if it's muddy because there's a big</v>
<v Speaker 2>salt water crocodile stirring it up or </v>

3628
02:41:51.960 --> 02:41:54.690
<v Speaker 2>because a buffalo gun wallow in every </v>
<v Speaker 2>bit of water there is.</v>

3629
02:41:55.630 --> 02:41:56.463
<v Speaker 2>So um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we walk the edge and you look for </v>

3630
02:41:59.101 --> 02:41:59.934
<v Speaker 2>crocodiles slides.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Crock slides doesn't mean there's no </v>

3631
02:42:01.591 --> 02:42:02.424
<v Speaker 2>crocs there if there's no crock slides.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we walk the edge and there was no </v>

3632
02:42:04.771 --> 02:42:06.810
<v Speaker 2>crocs slides now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Alan's a local.</v>

3633
02:42:06.811 --> 02:42:09.300
<v Speaker 2>He's a teacher up in the indigenous </v>
<v Speaker 2>community there.</v>

3634
02:42:10.260 --> 02:42:12.480
<v Speaker 2>He knows the ward is pretty well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't,</v>

3635
02:42:12.510 --> 02:42:15.350
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to tell if a crux moved in </v>
<v Speaker 2>there over the season or,</v>

3636
02:42:15.450 --> 02:42:16.283
<v Speaker 2>or anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we walk the edge and you just sat </v>

3637
02:42:18.690 --> 02:42:19.523
<v Speaker 2>desperate to get wet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like Cam was even to the point where </v>

3638
02:42:21.961 --> 02:42:23.160
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can we just die?</v>

3639
02:42:23.550 --> 02:42:26.280
<v Speaker 2>I'd,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd actually prefer to cool off and then</v>

3640
02:42:26.281 --> 02:42:27.510
<v Speaker 2>die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's just do it.</v>

3641
02:42:28.110 --> 02:42:32.550
<v Speaker 2>And then the other side like you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>desperate get sat heart that you're just</v>

3642
02:42:32.551 --> 02:42:34.710
<v Speaker 2>desperate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in a sense,</v>

3643
02:42:34.980 --> 02:42:35.813
<v Speaker 2>since I think it was essential to get in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the water at that point to get </v>

3644
02:42:38.490 --> 02:42:39.600
<v Speaker 2>rehydrated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3645
02:42:39.601 --> 02:42:40.434
<v Speaker 2>just for skin intake and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the water was the same temperature as </v>

3646
02:42:44.821 --> 02:42:45.270
<v Speaker 2>outside.</v>

3647
02:42:45.270 --> 02:42:46.103
<v Speaker 2>Like you'd go into the water and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>couldn't feel that you'll go and into </v>

3648
02:42:48.151 --> 02:42:50.040
<v Speaker 2>liquid because the water's at hot as </v>
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

3649
02:42:50.041 --> 02:42:50.874
<v Speaker 2>It's just been boiling in the sun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the light in there and just chill </v>

3650
02:42:53.311 --> 02:42:54.700
<v Speaker 2>out in the mud and every now and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd,</v>

3651
02:42:55.010 --> 02:42:55.843
<v Speaker 2>it's all muddy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bought them every now and then you'd </v>

3652
02:42:57.320 --> 02:42:58.153
<v Speaker 2>sort of pushed them out and release some</v>
<v Speaker 2>cooler waters that sort of hadn't been </v>

3653
02:43:00.631 --> 02:43:02.580
<v Speaker 2>coupla aside and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh ha ha,</v>

3654
02:43:05.730 --> 02:43:06.563
<v Speaker 2>that's what I made you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You really have to go through that shit </v>

3655
02:43:08.761 --> 02:43:09.594
<v Speaker 2>to appreciate things in life and one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>those things that are just appreciate </v>

3656
02:43:11.771 --> 02:43:11.990
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And</v>

3657
02:43:11.990 --> 02:43:14.530
<v Speaker 3>life was pushing for the modern,</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting a little bit cooler water,</v>

3658
02:43:14.531 --> 02:43:15.071
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

3659
02:43:15.071 --> 02:43:16.270
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is paradise.</v>

3660
02:43:16.590 --> 02:43:17.890
<v Speaker 3>And then two seconds later you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3661
02:43:17.891 --> 02:43:19.990
<v Speaker 3>this is uncomfortable as shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

3662
02:43:20.190 --> 02:43:21.023
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fact that people live that way and </v>

3663
02:43:22.571 --> 02:43:23.404
<v Speaker 3>struggled through those kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 3>environments and those kinds of </v>

3664
02:43:24.701 --> 02:43:27.460
<v Speaker 3>temperatures for untold years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>

3665
02:43:27.700 --> 02:43:32.620
<v Speaker 3>Before they ever figured out ice a </v>
<v Speaker 3>frigerator Eskimo air conditioning,</v>

3666
02:43:32.650 --> 02:43:35.390
<v Speaker 3>not eskimos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That'd be like hate baby hate.</v>

3667
02:43:35.500 --> 02:43:37.120
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's another extreme.</v>

3668
02:43:37.240 --> 02:43:41.730
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever seen when people go up </v>
<v Speaker 3>there and go hunting and like new Nevada</v>

3669
02:43:42.480 --> 02:43:46.030
<v Speaker 3>go a hunting for a fucking big hairy </v>
<v Speaker 3>things?</v>

3670
02:43:46.031 --> 02:43:50.290
<v Speaker 3>What's the big hairy things?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ox Muskox,</v>

3671
02:43:50.291 --> 02:43:53.190
<v Speaker 3>muskox things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It looks like a star wars animal.</v>

3672
02:43:53.200 --> 02:43:53.681
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it does.</v>

3673
02:43:53.681 --> 02:43:55.590
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't even look real time.</v>

3674
02:43:55.720 --> 02:43:57.250
<v Speaker 3>Enroll in and get warm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3675
02:43:57.270 --> 02:43:58.103
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've seen those things and you just go </v>

3676
02:44:00.210 --> 02:44:00.700
<v Speaker 3>with that.</v>

3677
02:44:00.700 --> 02:44:01.533
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so people live up there and they have </v>

3678
02:44:03.040 --> 02:44:03.873
<v Speaker 3>those things and then they live down </v>
<v Speaker 3>where you are and they hope for cool </v>

3679
02:44:07.901 --> 02:44:10.300
<v Speaker 3>mud.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those buffalo that we hunt,</v>

3680
02:44:10.630 --> 02:44:11.730
<v Speaker 3>it'll be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll think,</v>

3681
02:44:11.740 --> 02:44:12.573
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not going to be anything out any </v>

3682
02:44:14.291 --> 02:44:15.490
<v Speaker 3>way that I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's stinking hot.</v>

3683
02:44:15.491 --> 02:44:16.324
<v Speaker 3>Everything will be in the shade under a </v>
<v Speaker 3>tree or tucked under a riverbank or </v>

3684
02:44:19.001 --> 02:44:19.834
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those buffalo as black as I will be </v>

3685
02:44:21.941 --> 02:44:24.340
<v Speaker 3>standing out in the open,</v>
<v Speaker 3>complete son,</v>

3686
02:44:24.341 --> 02:44:26.300
<v Speaker 3>just graze and nothing even bothering </v>
<v Speaker 3>her,</v>

3687
02:44:26.430 --> 02:44:27.760
<v Speaker 3>bombarding them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

3688
02:44:27.850 --> 02:44:30.760
<v Speaker 3>most people listening to this have no </v>
<v Speaker 3>idea what a scrub bull is.</v>

3689
02:44:31.400 --> 02:44:33.490
<v Speaker 3>They hear the term spread bold.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't know what it means,</v>

3690
02:44:33.491 --> 02:44:38.491
<v Speaker 3>but it's a domestic domestic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a domestic cow that's bald.</v>

3691
02:44:38.650 --> 02:44:40.750
<v Speaker 3>I have a many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many centuries in Australia.</v>

3692
02:44:41.200 --> 02:44:44.070
<v Speaker 3>They've all Lena bread and it's a pretty</v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy looking.</v>

3693
02:44:44.110 --> 02:44:44.943
<v Speaker 3>That's the scrub bowl.</v>

3694
02:44:46.420 --> 02:44:47.260
<v Speaker 3>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That thing,</v>

3695
02:44:47.261 --> 02:44:49.060
<v Speaker 3>that's like a Brahmin there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so he's.</v>

3696
02:44:49.090 --> 02:44:52.090
<v Speaker 3>He's a bit of a breed bull.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Looking back on that thing,</v>

3697
02:44:52.091 --> 02:44:52.924
<v Speaker 3>what a strange hump and all it is is </v>
<v Speaker 3>that bold would be living in country </v>

3698
02:44:55.991 --> 02:44:58.390
<v Speaker 3>where a lot of different artists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>grable's haven't come through,</v>

3699
02:44:58.391 --> 02:44:59.224
<v Speaker 3>so it's still a fully wild bull,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it is nice to grab a scrap that one </v>

3700
02:45:06.251 --> 02:45:08.560
<v Speaker 3>right next to it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>jamie with the crazy horns.</v>

3701
02:45:08.561 --> 02:45:09.311
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3702
02:45:09.311 --> 02:45:11.380
<v Speaker 3>He's a big boy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>

3703
02:45:11.440 --> 02:45:13.750
<v Speaker 3>That's scrub bill too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's man.</v>

3704
02:45:13.751 --> 02:45:15.730
<v Speaker 3>That's in America.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at the trees in the back.</v>

3705
02:45:15.830 --> 02:45:19.270
<v Speaker 3>Those are married.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that it says Canada.</v>

3706
02:45:19.690 --> 02:45:20.523
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Canada.</v>

3707
02:45:21.070 --> 02:45:23.560
<v Speaker 3>What is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Same thing right now.</v>

3708
02:45:24.160 --> 02:45:24.993
<v Speaker 3>They can't even come over here unless we</v>
<v Speaker 3>let them and they don't let us over </v>

3709
02:45:27.941 --> 02:45:28.840
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Over there.</v>

3710
02:45:28.960 --> 02:45:30.400
<v Speaker 3>If you've got a drunk driving </v>
<v Speaker 3>conviction.</v>

3711
02:45:30.580 --> 02:45:33.400
<v Speaker 3>So they have troubles in Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's weird.</v>

3712
02:45:33.401 --> 02:45:34.540
<v Speaker 3>I've never seen that before.</v>

3713
02:45:34.600 --> 02:45:38.200
<v Speaker 3>I thought that was an Australian thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does that one down there?</v>

3714
02:45:38.320 --> 02:45:40.180
<v Speaker 3>These people would just fucking shooting</v>
<v Speaker 3>their cows.</v>

3715
02:45:41.400 --> 02:45:42.730
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he'd be scrabbling.</v>

3716
02:45:43.200 --> 02:45:44.270
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What a Brahmin.</v>

3717
02:45:44.300 --> 02:45:46.210
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that's a buffalo.</v>

3718
02:45:47.130 --> 02:45:47.963
<v Speaker 3>That's not scalable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a big water buffalo at a crazy </v>

3719
02:45:50.411 --> 02:45:51.310
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is.</v>

3720
02:45:51.430 --> 02:45:55.060
<v Speaker 3>So that is something from Asia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Europe from Asia.</v>

3721
02:45:55.420 --> 02:45:57.670
<v Speaker 3>Where is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a water buffalo.</v>

3722
02:45:58.100 --> 02:45:59.640
<v Speaker 3>Just just call the water buffalo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>

3723
02:45:59.950 --> 02:46:02.050
<v Speaker 3>So there's a Cape Buffalo that are from </v>
<v Speaker 3>Africa.</v>

3724
02:46:02.920 --> 02:46:04.900
<v Speaker 3>What does that one?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not the lower left corner,</v>

3725
02:46:04.901 --> 02:46:07.480
<v Speaker 3>but the one right next to a jamie?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3726
02:46:07.660 --> 02:46:08.890
<v Speaker 3>What is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What the.</v>

3727
02:46:09.110 --> 02:46:10.490
<v Speaker 3>Is that a good scrub?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Say,</v>

3728
02:46:10.680 --> 02:46:14.150
<v Speaker 3>Oh look how the color is very in that </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they real interbred animal,</v>

3729
02:46:14.500 --> 02:46:17.030
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's why bread with other,</v>

3730
02:46:17.450 --> 02:46:20.720
<v Speaker 3>other variety of cattle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hm.</v>

3731
02:46:21.150 --> 02:46:23.900
<v Speaker 3>Now the mate value is not as good as the</v>
<v Speaker 3>breeding values.</v>

3732
02:46:23.901 --> 02:46:24.734
<v Speaker 3>Not as good because the visitors there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bit of this and they're a bit of that </v>

3733
02:46:27.951 --> 02:46:28.790
<v Speaker 3>there a bit of everything.</v>

3734
02:46:28.850 --> 02:46:29.720
<v Speaker 3>It's like a dog,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3735
02:46:29.721 --> 02:46:32.420
<v Speaker 3>you bought a purebred dog or you buy a </v>
<v Speaker 3>mango,</v>

3736
02:46:32.421 --> 02:46:33.290
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3737
02:46:33.291 --> 02:46:34.124
<v Speaker 3>a couple of different species in one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What has the big value is the purebred </v>

3738
02:46:37.070 --> 02:46:40.510
<v Speaker 3>right and assignment these cattle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that.</v>

3739
02:46:40.620 --> 02:46:41.453
<v Speaker 3>The big issue with the cattle industry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially in these northern parts of </v>

3740
02:46:45.591 --> 02:46:47.150
<v Speaker 3>Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is these.</v>

3741
02:46:47.270 --> 02:46:48.103
<v Speaker 3>They scrubbed bulls.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These feral cattle don't have any </v>

3742
02:46:50.631 --> 02:46:51.464
<v Speaker 3>respect for fences.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would just walk straight through a </v>

3743
02:46:52.581 --> 02:46:53.414
<v Speaker 3>fence into a farmer's prize cattle and </v>
<v Speaker 3>stopped breeding with these prized </v>

3744
02:46:58.321 --> 02:47:01.850
<v Speaker 3>cattle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then all those carbs that he gets on</v>

3745
02:47:01.880 --> 02:47:04.700
<v Speaker 3>the purebred cattle anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's really bad for the industry.</v>

3746
02:47:04.820 --> 02:47:07.820
<v Speaker 3>So they knock the fence down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some composting.</v>

3747
02:47:07.821 --> 02:47:12.160
<v Speaker 3>That's pretty much it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And a big issue.</v>

3748
02:47:12.260 --> 02:47:15.710
<v Speaker 3>What would happen in America if those </v>
<v Speaker 3>cows that I saw wandering around,</v>

3749
02:47:15.770 --> 02:47:18.570
<v Speaker 3>if they were allowed to have balls and </v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3750
02:47:19.210 --> 02:47:21.950
<v Speaker 3>free day out there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'd eventually become just like that,</v>

3751
02:47:21.951 --> 02:47:22.580
<v Speaker 3>that that's right.</v>

3752
02:47:22.580 --> 02:47:27.190
<v Speaker 3>So they just didn't uncheck species of </v>
<v Speaker 3>animal in Australia at the scrub and uh,</v>

3753
02:47:27.310 --> 02:47:29.150
<v Speaker 3>they just free to come and go wherever </v>
<v Speaker 3>they want.</v>

3754
02:47:29.151 --> 02:47:29.984
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So a lot of farmers really pushed to </v>

3755
02:47:32.660 --> 02:47:36.470
<v Speaker 3>shoot them out or get them cold or ran </v>
<v Speaker 3>off or off their property.</v>

3756
02:47:36.620 --> 02:47:39.470
<v Speaker 3>I'd say unbelievably aggressive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Super aggressive.</v>

3757
02:47:39.740 --> 02:47:41.810
<v Speaker 3>More aggressive than a buffalo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>

3758
02:47:42.110 --> 02:47:43.580
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why underwater?</v>

3759
02:47:44.200 --> 02:47:45.830
<v Speaker 3>Because they're pissed off because they </v>
<v Speaker 3>were in a bread.</v>

3760
02:47:46.550 --> 02:47:47.101
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3761
02:47:47.101 --> 02:47:47.934
<v Speaker 3>They know they just a cranky animal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've also got bulls are pretty fucking </v>

3762
02:47:53.901 --> 02:47:54.770
<v Speaker 3>aggressive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3763
02:47:54.771 --> 02:47:55.604
<v Speaker 3>obviously the bulls,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm talking like bull cows that we have </v>

3764
02:47:58.041 --> 02:47:59.540
<v Speaker 3>in America.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why people ride them.</v>

3765
02:47:59.541 --> 02:48:01.190
<v Speaker 3>They only get eight seconds if they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>lucky.</v>

3766
02:48:01.191 --> 02:48:02.690
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're trying to be like that.</v>

3767
02:48:02.691 --> 02:48:04.020
<v Speaker 3>They're right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

3768
02:48:04.580 --> 02:48:06.710
<v Speaker 3>just natural,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

3769
02:48:06.740 --> 02:48:07.573
<v Speaker 3>naturally pissed off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a good question because like when </v>

3770
02:48:09.081 --> 02:48:09.914
<v Speaker 3>you see like bull fighters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are those bowls trained to try to fuck </v>

3771
02:48:13.011 --> 02:48:13.844
<v Speaker 3>up the matador?</v>

3772
02:48:14.280 --> 02:48:15.620
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

3773
02:48:15.740 --> 02:48:16.573
<v Speaker 3>Ask Rob.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll just do that shit off their own </v>

3774
02:48:17.631 --> 02:48:18.464
<v Speaker 3>back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can tell you now that's really </v>

3775
02:48:19.731 --> 02:48:22.100
<v Speaker 3>aggressive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've got bank Tang Bulls as well.</v>

3776
02:48:22.190 --> 02:48:24.860
<v Speaker 3>I've heard of those cats.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Solly cattle.</v>

3777
02:48:25.070 --> 02:48:25.851
<v Speaker 3>What's a bank?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tang?</v>

3778
02:48:25.851 --> 02:48:28.040
<v Speaker 3>What does it look like?</v>
<v Speaker 3>A Jeremy will bring on up.</v>

3779
02:48:28.041 --> 02:48:28.940
<v Speaker 3>No Daddy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Say it.</v>

3780
02:48:29.550 --> 02:48:31.490
<v Speaker 3>Bank Tang or spell?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Excuse me?</v>

3781
02:48:31.700 --> 02:48:33.440
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

3782
02:48:33.441 --> 02:48:38.360
<v Speaker 3>I n j.</v>
<v Speaker 3>t a n g a bank.</v>

3783
02:48:38.840 --> 02:48:41.150
<v Speaker 3>I believe you've been wanting an ounce.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One word.</v>

3784
02:48:41.270 --> 02:48:46.270
<v Speaker 3>One would bang Tang.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So back home that night eve lanes,</v>

3785
02:48:47.061 --> 02:48:48.500
<v Speaker 3>they nearly extinct so that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that'd be,</v>

3786
02:48:49.040 --> 02:48:50.690
<v Speaker 3>that'd be back home.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3787
02:48:50.691 --> 02:48:53.960
<v Speaker 3>So Asia in Indonesia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're almost extinct,</v>

3788
02:48:53.961 --> 02:48:54.794
<v Speaker 3>but America or rather Australia there </v>
<v Speaker 3>where they run wild and they like a </v>

3789
02:48:58.521 --> 02:49:01.220
<v Speaker 3>velvet skin cattle yet I run wild </v>
<v Speaker 3>elephant skin.</v>

3790
02:49:02.330 --> 02:49:04.640
<v Speaker 3>Skin man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They are a beautiful creature.</v>

3791
02:49:04.790 --> 02:49:08.100
<v Speaker 3>What a weird looking kel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a good creature</v>

3792
02:49:08.520 --> 02:49:12.270
<v Speaker 2>type in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm good hand outback experience.</v>

3793
02:49:12.330 --> 02:49:16.240
<v Speaker 2>That's one of my buddies that God's </v>
<v Speaker 2>there for anyone interested and uh,</v>

3794
02:49:16.380 --> 02:49:17.213
<v Speaker 2>he's got access to these bank Tang on </v>
<v Speaker 2>some of the most beautiful country that </v>

3795
02:49:21.391 --> 02:49:23.130
<v Speaker 2>you've ever seen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like in northern Australia.</v>

3796
02:49:23.730 --> 02:49:25.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bring up something from Carl's.</v>

3797
02:49:25.381 --> 02:49:27.880
<v Speaker 2>They lucky they got a bank there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's an old one.</v>

3798
02:49:27.881 --> 02:49:32.130
<v Speaker 2>See that bolt's going across the head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looks like their skin is suede.</v>

3799
02:49:32.220 --> 02:49:33.053
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they will charge on movement real </v>

3800
02:49:36.630 --> 02:49:37.463
<v Speaker 2>out of those all bulls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they say movement vow that I would </v>

3801
02:49:39.811 --> 02:49:40.644
<v Speaker 2>prefer to come at you then turn away </v>
<v Speaker 2>because there's a risk in 10 in that </v>

3802
02:49:43.021 --> 02:49:47.660
<v Speaker 2>back to you if you get within a certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>distance and um,</v>

3803
02:49:48.260 --> 02:49:52.050
<v Speaker 2>is called lay with a Yeti hat on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

3804
02:49:52.051 --> 02:49:52.884
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I shot one last year or the year before </v>

3805
02:49:55.351 --> 02:50:00.070
<v Speaker 2>we've called and it comes straight at us</v>
<v Speaker 2>and call us carrying a big gun lock.</v>

3806
02:50:00.070 --> 02:50:04.920
<v Speaker 2>I showed up with a bow and calo lifted </v>
<v Speaker 2>up the gun and he shot this bank tank as</v>

3807
02:50:04.921 --> 02:50:08.330
<v Speaker 2>it was charged and it literally dropped </v>
<v Speaker 2>nine feet from Carl.</v>

3808
02:50:08.380 --> 02:50:11.610
<v Speaker 2>Like it just looked straight at him and </v>
<v Speaker 2>just hammered straight out of him.</v>

3809
02:50:11.611 --> 02:50:13.610
<v Speaker 2>I'll go to a second shot off as it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>running,</v>

3810
02:50:14.040 --> 02:50:14.873
<v Speaker 2>actually broke its leg,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which made it stumble and then it just </v>

3811
02:50:17.851 --> 02:50:20.000
<v Speaker 2>comes straight back up and kept coming </v>
<v Speaker 2>into colony,</v>

3812
02:50:20.010 --> 02:50:21.830
<v Speaker 2>pulled the gun up and he showed it </v>
<v Speaker 2>straight between the eyes.</v>

3813
02:50:21.831 --> 02:50:23.370
<v Speaker 2>It was an amazing shot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3814
02:50:23.371 --> 02:50:28.371
<v Speaker 2>don't go by the way that man that I will</v>
<v Speaker 2>tell you up.</v>

3815
02:50:28.530 --> 02:50:29.490
<v Speaker 2>They're scary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Credo.</v>

3816
02:50:29.850 --> 02:50:30.683
<v Speaker 2>What a weird as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess it's because you fucking shot </v>

3817
02:50:32.251 --> 02:50:34.680
<v Speaker 2>over the bow and Arrow to be upset with </v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

3818
02:50:35.610 --> 02:50:36.730
<v Speaker 2>Probably.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>

3819
02:50:36.950 --> 02:50:40.020
<v Speaker 2>it seems like a crazy idea to shoot one </v>
<v Speaker 2>of those things by yourself though.</v>

3820
02:50:40.030 --> 02:50:41.670
<v Speaker 2>Like you almost have to have a rifle </v>
<v Speaker 2>backup.</v>

3821
02:50:41.880 --> 02:50:43.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if that's the case,</v>

3822
02:50:44.040 --> 02:50:45.840
<v Speaker 2>why hunt with a bow?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

3823
02:50:45.850 --> 02:50:46.683
<v Speaker 2>You have a rifle backup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's probably time that I did with </v>

3824
02:50:48.541 --> 02:50:52.560
<v Speaker 2>buffalo was with a gun the very first </v>
<v Speaker 2>time I went was a good move.</v>

3825
02:50:52.620 --> 02:50:53.670
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had the bug.</v>

3826
02:50:53.671 --> 02:50:55.020
<v Speaker 2>My buddy had the gum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

3827
02:50:55.021 --> 02:50:57.030
<v Speaker 2>My buddy iron grant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a really good shot too,</v>

3828
02:50:57.060 --> 02:50:58.380
<v Speaker 2>so I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

3829
02:50:58.530 --> 02:51:00.630
<v Speaker 2>you want to come on this trip with me </v>
<v Speaker 2>would be good.</v>

3830
02:51:00.631 --> 02:51:02.370
<v Speaker 2>You can shoot one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in that case,</v>

3831
02:51:02.371 --> 02:51:06.480
<v Speaker 2>like why not just hunt with a rifle </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you're not going to kill it with</v>

3832
02:51:06.481 --> 02:51:08.760
<v Speaker 2>a bow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That quick might.</v>

3833
02:51:08.850 --> 02:51:09.683
<v Speaker 2>You can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can 95 percent of the time you can </v>

3834
02:51:12.150 --> 02:51:15.870
<v Speaker 2>have five percent of motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I shot three bulls on that trip.</v>

3835
02:51:16.170 --> 02:51:19.500
<v Speaker 2>I got three complete postures with and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got three bulls that died.</v>

3836
02:51:19.500 --> 02:51:20.333
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>In view.</v>

3837
02:51:20.680 --> 02:51:22.470
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have a single issue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3838
02:51:22.920 --> 02:51:23.753
<v Speaker 2>but what the rifle Donnie's is that got </v>
<v Speaker 2>you to go to places that usually </v>

3839
02:51:26.160 --> 02:51:27.750
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't like that bulls out in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>open.</v>

3840
02:51:28.410 --> 02:51:31.020
<v Speaker 2>And if you didn't have a rifle backup </v>
<v Speaker 2>behind you,</v>

3841
02:51:31.021 --> 02:51:32.820
<v Speaker 2>you probably wouldn't proceed out there </v>
<v Speaker 2>and be like,</v>

3842
02:51:33.150 --> 02:51:36.060
<v Speaker 2>there's no trees around the client.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to shoot that bowl.</v>

3843
02:51:36.061 --> 02:51:38.310
<v Speaker 2>But when you've got a rifle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it makes you a little bit game of like,</v>

3844
02:51:38.311 --> 02:51:39.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously my buddy Aaron's on,</v>

3845
02:51:40.180 --> 02:51:41.013
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's just waiting for shit to go south </v>

3846
02:51:42.420 --> 02:51:45.690
<v Speaker 2>and he's gonna pull a gun off and give </v>
<v Speaker 2>it one that didn't happen.</v>

3847
02:51:46.180 --> 02:51:47.013
<v Speaker 2>Oh Man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a trip since I've never hunted </v>

3848
02:51:48.001 --> 02:51:51.940
<v Speaker 2>with a rifle backup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you've got to know your,</v>

3849
02:51:52.110 --> 02:51:54.060
<v Speaker 2>you've got to know your boundaries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know I,</v>

3850
02:51:54.100 --> 02:51:57.000
<v Speaker 2>there's a big line bull out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no trees.</v>

3851
02:51:57.000 --> 02:51:59.070
<v Speaker 2>He's right out in the open.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You take a shot at him.</v>

3852
02:51:59.071 --> 02:52:00.900
<v Speaker 2>He was the first thing he looks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He looks at,</v>

3853
02:52:01.260 --> 02:52:04.070
<v Speaker 2>he's going to clean you up and I do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know that.</v>

3854
02:52:04.130 --> 02:52:05.360
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that thing happens.</v>

3855
02:52:05.361 --> 02:52:06.194
<v Speaker 2>So fuck that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That seems ridiculous that you'll come </v>

3856
02:52:08.801 --> 02:52:10.050
<v Speaker 2>in and do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

<v Speaker 2>You're not allowed to.</v>

3861
02:52:12.960 --> 02:52:14.440
<v Speaker 2>When they're laughing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't.</v>

3862
02:52:14.890 --> 02:52:16.400
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the,</v>

3863
02:52:17.170 --> 02:52:20.020
<v Speaker 2>the least likely to kill you if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>shoot it in Buffalo,</v>

3864
02:52:20.230 --> 02:52:21.520
<v Speaker 2>buffalo hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

3865
02:52:21.580 --> 02:52:22.690
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3866
02:52:22.960 --> 02:52:24.940
<v Speaker 2>hell no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The least likely to kill you.</v>

3867
02:52:25.030 --> 02:52:27.310
<v Speaker 2>A freaking rabbit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rabbit.</v>

3868
02:52:27.311 --> 02:52:27.881
<v Speaker 2>You're good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3869
02:52:27.881 --> 02:52:29.590
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kinda out there.</v>

3870
02:52:29.591 --> 02:52:31.300
<v Speaker 2>Was It on a rabbit?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3871
02:52:31.301 --> 02:52:32.530
<v Speaker 2>awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3872
02:52:32.531 --> 02:52:34.040
<v Speaker 2>you have to kill a lot of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't show you.</v>

3873
02:52:34.150 --> 02:52:35.550
<v Speaker 2>They're overpopulated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>already popping.</v>

3874
02:52:35.580 --> 02:52:36.550
<v Speaker 2>You got a skewer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uhm,</v>

3875
02:52:36.640 --> 02:52:38.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get as many as you want.</v>

3876
02:52:38.470 --> 02:52:40.900
<v Speaker 2>It's a funny thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As big as that animal is,</v>

3877
02:52:41.130 --> 02:52:41.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

3878
02:52:41.860 --> 02:52:43.600
<v Speaker 2>and may say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>know your boundaries.</v>

3879
02:52:43.690 --> 02:52:46.600
<v Speaker 2>If you do the right shot on that animal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the first thing.</v>

3880
02:52:47.050 --> 02:52:49.030
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got to make sure that shots right</v>

3881
02:52:49.090 --> 02:52:49.923
<v Speaker 2>angles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3882
02:52:50.050 --> 02:52:51.740
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're confident with your bow.</v>

3883
02:52:52.060 --> 02:52:54.310
<v Speaker 2>You put that shot into the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the right spot.</v>

3884
02:52:54.370 --> 02:52:56.590
<v Speaker 2>Then there's no risk because that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

3885
02:52:56.610 --> 02:53:00.630
<v Speaker 2>that animal is dead before it gets to </v>
<v Speaker 2>you staying still off the shop.</v>

3886
02:53:00.660 --> 02:53:01.271
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>

3887
02:53:01.271 --> 02:53:02.580
<v Speaker 2>I'm not the person to shoot something </v>
<v Speaker 2>like.</v>

3888
02:53:02.590 --> 02:53:03.371
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

3889
02:53:03.371 --> 02:53:05.290
<v Speaker 2>I shot it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not like that.</v>

3890
02:53:05.291 --> 02:53:07.090
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a little bit disrespectful </v>
<v Speaker 2>even,</v>

3891
02:53:07.091 --> 02:53:07.924
<v Speaker 2>but it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's also a dangerous and it's on </v>

3892
02:53:10.671 --> 02:53:12.430
<v Speaker 2>peaceful for the animal because you do </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

3893
02:53:12.490 --> 02:53:13.323
<v Speaker 2>It gives the animal and an adrenaline </v>
<v Speaker 2>boost animals within an adrenaline </v>

3894
02:53:15.961 --> 02:53:16.900
<v Speaker 2>boost.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Man,</v>

3895
02:53:16.901 --> 02:53:18.610
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a hill reckoning,</v>

3896
02:53:19.120 --> 02:53:21.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>buffalo or Buffalo,</v>

3897
02:53:21.821 --> 02:53:22.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that will carry them.</v>

3898
02:53:23.370 --> 02:53:24.710
<v Speaker 2>It might make,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3899
02:53:25.400 --> 02:53:28.090
<v Speaker 2>it might make their death longer </v>
<v Speaker 2>because,</v>

3900
02:53:28.160 --> 02:53:30.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're filled with adrenaline and stuff</v>

3901
02:53:30.131 --> 02:53:30.880
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

3902
02:53:30.880 --> 02:53:33.940
<v Speaker 2>You shoot an animal and you be quiet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You put the shot in the right spot.</v>

3903
02:53:33.970 --> 02:53:34.803
<v Speaker 2>It's so peaceful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've actually shot things and they'd </v>

3904
02:53:36.881 --> 02:53:37.930
<v Speaker 2>been like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was that?</v>

3905
02:53:38.020 --> 02:53:41.980
<v Speaker 2>Put their head down and stop fading </v>
<v Speaker 2>again and toppled over why they fade and</v>

3906
02:53:41.990 --> 02:53:42.823
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know their hit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the beauties about Boeing </v>

3907
02:53:45.140 --> 02:53:48.300
<v Speaker 2>at tasteful and that's why you don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>carry on like a frigging jerk.</v>

3908
02:53:48.550 --> 02:53:49.900
<v Speaker 2>Why don't you shoot something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3909
02:53:49.910 --> 02:53:52.270
<v Speaker 2>just quiet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nice and humble.</v>

3910
02:53:52.830 --> 02:53:53.663
<v Speaker 2>The animal dies peacefully.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what every Honda should drive </v>

3911
02:53:55.430 --> 02:53:56.470
<v Speaker 2>for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3912
02:53:56.471 --> 02:53:57.304
<v Speaker 2>It's um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>also you'd have to have the proper </v>

3913
02:53:58.781 --> 02:53:59.561
<v Speaker 2>equipment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3914
02:53:59.561 --> 02:54:01.360
<v Speaker 2>If you're going to penetrate the side of</v>
<v Speaker 2>a buffalo,</v>

3915
02:54:01.361 --> 02:54:04.480
<v Speaker 2>you have to very strong bow and heavy </v>
<v Speaker 2>arrows.</v>

3916
02:54:04.510 --> 02:54:05.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3917
02:54:06.310 --> 02:54:09.250
<v Speaker 2>I like that because you can't tell if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to hit a rebound.</v>

3918
02:54:09.251 --> 02:54:11.860
<v Speaker 2>The yes and all the way out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we've,</v>

3919
02:54:11.870 --> 02:54:16.870
<v Speaker 2>my setup like I mostly shoot 70 pounds </v>
<v Speaker 2>when I'm shooting idea at the moment and</v>

3920
02:54:16.961 --> 02:54:19.150
<v Speaker 2>that heavy Arrow and a solid one piece.</v>

3921
02:54:19.150 --> 02:54:21.270
<v Speaker 2>It's just a solid piece of steel to </v>
<v Speaker 2>blade.</v>

3922
02:54:21.280 --> 02:54:23.830
<v Speaker 2>Broaden those vpa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Broader Shane Dorian shoot some as well.</v>

3923
02:54:23.831 --> 02:54:24.960
<v Speaker 2>Blog vantage point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>audrey.</v>

3924
02:54:25.450 --> 02:54:28.150
<v Speaker 2>It's 150 grains.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a heavy Bronto.</v>

3925
02:54:28.300 --> 02:54:30.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then it's got a decent insert behind it,</v>

3926
02:54:30.701 --> 02:54:35.470
<v Speaker 2>like 92 grain insert and then I'm a nice</v>
<v Speaker 2>heavy shaft.</v>

3927
02:54:35.740 --> 02:54:37.930
<v Speaker 2>And then let's just talk about the ID,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pam.</v>

3928
02:54:38.070 --> 02:54:38.903
<v Speaker 2>We've got 80 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can find a rib on the way on the </v>

3929
02:54:41.051 --> 02:54:42.700
<v Speaker 2>buffalo and I can find a Freebie on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>way out.</v>

3930
02:54:42.701 --> 02:54:45.970
<v Speaker 2>And the arrows still just going to bus </v>
<v Speaker 2>straight through there.</v>

3931
02:54:46.120 --> 02:54:48.880
<v Speaker 2>Now how have you used the Arrow?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's about.</v>

3932
02:54:49.440 --> 02:54:50.273
<v Speaker 2>Well it depends what I'm shooting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but with the IED pan I'm shooting sit </v>

3933
02:54:53.200 --> 02:54:55.180
<v Speaker 2>670 grinds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

3934
02:54:55.240 --> 02:54:57.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And with the 70 pound boat it's not much</v>

3935
02:54:57.701 --> 02:54:59.590
<v Speaker 2>different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's about 620 grinds,</v>

3936
02:54:59.830 --> 02:55:04.160
<v Speaker 2>670 grains is really haven't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that Mike's a quiet bio and it makes</v>

3937
02:55:04.160 --> 02:55:06.840
<v Speaker 3>a punch when it hits animals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And how many feet per second?</v>

3938
02:55:06.850 --> 02:55:07.740
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>none of that don't.</v>

3939
02:55:07.850 --> 02:55:09.620
<v Speaker 3>I don't even get into that technical </v>
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>

3940
02:55:09.650 --> 02:55:10.520
<v Speaker 3>Do you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3941
02:55:10.550 --> 02:55:13.540
<v Speaker 3>do tapes or do you do it by,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3942
02:55:13.580 --> 02:55:16.090
<v Speaker 3>by eye and then write it on the tape?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not.</v>

3943
02:55:16.100 --> 02:55:19.280
<v Speaker 3>I've got site tapes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So how do you calculate your site tapes?</v>

3944
02:55:19.790 --> 02:55:20.750
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you don't.</v>

3945
02:55:21.260 --> 02:55:25.950
<v Speaker 3>Well I've got the tiger or option </v>
<v Speaker 3>archery now and it's a,</v>

3946
02:55:26.000 --> 02:55:30.470
<v Speaker 3>the option five option six site.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's got an adjustable pin.</v>

3947
02:55:31.010 --> 02:55:31.843
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got all your fixed pins that you </v>

3948
02:55:32.931 --> 02:55:33.764
<v Speaker 3>flip in place now if that one I'll just </v>
<v Speaker 3>shoot my 20 and actually shoot all my </v>

3949
02:55:37.761 --> 02:55:42.440
<v Speaker 3>pins in the 50 and then I match it up </v>
<v Speaker 3>with the site type and then I stick that</v>

3950
02:55:42.441 --> 02:55:43.274
<v Speaker 3>on the go at the 20 minute mark.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then when I pull up multiple pin out </v>

3951
02:55:46.581 --> 02:55:47.414
<v Speaker 3>of the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've just got the single pin that winds </v>

3952
02:55:48.550 --> 02:55:49.460
<v Speaker 3>up and down that day mark.</v>

3953
02:55:49.480 --> 02:55:52.220
<v Speaker 3>Obviously I shoot it and check it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I have and it's spot on.</v>

3954
02:55:52.221 --> 02:55:53.270
<v Speaker 3>It's perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3955
02:55:53.271 --> 02:55:55.190
<v Speaker 3>So you don't do anything like archers </v>
<v Speaker 3>advantage,</v>

3956
02:55:55.191 --> 02:55:58.130
<v Speaker 3>do it through a computer calculation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's interesting.</v>

3957
02:55:58.160 --> 02:56:00.460
<v Speaker 3>I just love shooting it all myself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so helpful.</v>

3958
02:56:00.510 --> 02:56:04.740
<v Speaker 3>We'll move each pin for that shot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'll shoot and um,</v>

3959
02:56:04.900 --> 02:56:05.733
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>zero to 20 the first pin and then I'll </v>

3960
02:56:08.841 --> 02:56:10.880
<v Speaker 3>walk back the 30 and I'll shoot and I'll</v>
<v Speaker 3>just to keep,</v>

3961
02:56:11.000 --> 02:56:12.700
<v Speaker 3>keep shooting and adjusting that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3962
02:56:12.710 --> 02:56:13.543
<v Speaker 3>in tiny little increments if I have to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you have like a range at your house </v>

3963
02:56:16.401 --> 02:56:18.380
<v Speaker 3>that you do all this stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd do it all up in the farm.</v>

3964
02:56:18.560 --> 02:56:19.393
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I sent you those photos at the time of </v>

3965
02:56:20.241 --> 02:56:21.980
<v Speaker 3>that cabin that I built.</v>

<v Speaker 3>God that pictures incredible and there's</v>
<v Speaker 3>a heap of pitches like that on this </v>

3999
02:57:39.890 --> 02:57:43.660
<v Speaker 3>picture is from how long ago?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's all Idaho.</v>

4000
02:57:43.700 --> 02:57:46.760
<v Speaker 3>That's just the other day yesterday,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one day ago now.</v>

4001
02:57:46.761 --> 02:57:49.790
<v Speaker 3>How do you take this photo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like where you see all those stars?</v>

4002
02:57:49.791 --> 02:57:50.624
<v Speaker 3>Is it just setting the aperture </v>
<v Speaker 3>correctly yet sitting aperture </v>

4003
02:57:53.240 --> 02:57:55.040
<v Speaker 3>correctly?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Lens that I use,</v>

4004
02:57:55.160 --> 02:57:56.980
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a stigma outlands.</v>

4005
02:57:56.990 --> 02:58:01.530
<v Speaker 3>It's the 20 Mil lens and the f stop on </v>
<v Speaker 3>that Lens is only like one point four.</v>

4006
02:58:01.531 --> 02:58:03.750
<v Speaker 3>Like that's super,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Super Low,</v>

4007
02:58:03.751 --> 02:58:04.920
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does that mean?</v>

4008
02:58:05.100 --> 02:58:07.740
<v Speaker 3>I don't know shit about photography,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like your.</v>

4009
02:58:07.741 --> 02:58:10.180
<v Speaker 3>I've been closed up and then United </v>
<v Speaker 3>States,</v>

4010
02:58:10.230 --> 02:58:11.760
<v Speaker 3>I say an f four,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

4011
02:58:11.820 --> 02:58:13.940
<v Speaker 3>Your eyes really closed up and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

4012
02:58:14.280 --> 02:58:15.113
<v Speaker 3>f one point four would be like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But imagine how much more light and </v>

4013
02:58:17.551 --> 02:58:21.030
<v Speaker 3>everything he could get in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's probably bicycle I have explained</v>

4014
02:58:21.040 --> 02:58:22.560
<v Speaker 3>in it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>

4015
02:58:22.561 --> 02:58:24.240
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I will,</v>

4016
02:58:24.490 --> 02:58:25.650
<v Speaker 3>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll set the camera up.</v>

4017
02:58:25.651 --> 02:58:27.790
<v Speaker 3>It's got to be on a tripod because </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's like a,</v>

4018
02:58:28.470 --> 02:58:30.750
<v Speaker 3>a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jamie's got to explain.</v>

4019
02:58:30.840 --> 02:58:32.760
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got an f number.</v>

4020
02:58:32.820 --> 02:58:37.080
<v Speaker 3>Wikipedia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like exponentially larger.</v>

4021
02:58:37.140 --> 02:58:40.140
<v Speaker 3>Every time you drop in a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an increment,</v>

4022
02:58:40.320 --> 02:58:43.980
<v Speaker 3>it gets exponentially larger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then as you go higher and f stops,</v>

4023
02:58:44.020 --> 02:58:45.570
<v Speaker 3>it'll get smaller.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

4024
02:58:45.690 --> 02:58:46.260
<v Speaker 3>There you go.</v>

4025
02:58:46.260 --> 02:58:47.970
<v Speaker 3>So self taught,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is all luck.</v>

4026
02:58:48.030 --> 02:58:51.150
<v Speaker 3>I just self taught so I'm not really </v>
<v Speaker 3>into the lingo,</v>

4027
02:58:51.151 --> 02:58:52.150
<v Speaker 3>but they go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll go.</v>

4028
02:58:52.170 --> 02:58:55.440
<v Speaker 3>So the same thing is with bowhunting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're self taught with photographers as</v>

4029
02:58:55.441 --> 02:58:57.210
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what happens when you live out in</v>

4030
02:58:57.211 --> 02:59:00.090
<v Speaker 3>the jungle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fucking bank tanks.</v>

4031
02:59:00.091 --> 02:59:00.924
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wild snakes and decided that that's </v>

4032
02:59:02.791 --> 02:59:07.230
<v Speaker 3>obviously set up on a tripod and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>about a 15 second exposure.</v>

4033
02:59:07.320 --> 02:59:08.153
<v Speaker 3>So you know that it's open for 15 </v>
<v Speaker 3>seconds and the guy was in a lot more </v>

4034
02:59:11.191 --> 02:59:12.230
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>damn,</v>

4035
02:59:12.270 --> 02:59:17.220
<v Speaker 3>that Montana law is beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How many days ago was that from Jamie?</v>

4036
02:59:18.960 --> 02:59:22.600
<v Speaker 3>Six days ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not as your.</v>

4037
02:59:22.840 --> 02:59:23.673
<v Speaker 3>This is what a amazing fisher.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's your tent and your tent looks </v>

4038
02:59:26.701 --> 02:59:27.534
<v Speaker 3>like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you have like a headlamp inside the </v>

4039
02:59:28.741 --> 02:59:31.170
<v Speaker 3>tent or something?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That tiny little headlamp.</v>

4040
02:59:31.510 --> 02:59:33.450
<v Speaker 3>So you left that on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>left that on,</v>

4041
02:59:33.570 --> 02:59:37.920
<v Speaker 3>and then set the camera up and the stars</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

4042
02:59:37.920 --> 02:59:38.753
<v Speaker 3>So that's what you're seeing every night</v>
<v Speaker 3>while you were camping up there every </v>

4043
02:59:41.250 --> 02:59:42.130
<v Speaker 3>night until the moon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Come in,</v>

4044
02:59:43.020 --> 02:59:44.720
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's fucking pretty.</v>

4045
02:59:44.740 --> 02:59:49.440
<v Speaker 3>I love moonless nights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just just for that to the best.</v>

4046
02:59:49.441 --> 02:59:50.940
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's nothing like that,</v>

4047
02:59:51.030 --> 02:59:53.880
<v Speaker 3>that view of the milky ways and saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

4048
02:59:54.030 --> 02:59:54.863
<v Speaker 3>if he can join me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you go back a little bit and you'll </v>

4049
02:59:56.401 --> 02:59:58.980
<v Speaker 3>see you'll see some dead buffalo </v>
<v Speaker 3>pitchers.</v>

4050
02:59:59.340 --> 03:00:00.900
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I ran that time.</v>

4051
03:00:00.901 --> 03:00:03.420
<v Speaker 3>I was taking some shots when I was in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Arnhem land.</v>

4052
03:00:03.540 --> 03:00:05.810
<v Speaker 3>And because there's no artificial,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no,</v>

4053
03:00:05.890 --> 03:00:07.650
<v Speaker 3>no light pollution.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>

4054
03:00:07.720 --> 03:00:11.210
<v Speaker 3>up to the stars with the knife at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like the,</v>

4055
03:00:11.290 --> 03:00:12.123
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the aperture and everything can come </v>

4056
03:00:13.141 --> 03:00:16.050
<v Speaker 3>back so much further on those nights </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's just,</v>

4057
03:00:16.140 --> 03:00:18.390
<v Speaker 3>even with the human eye,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just crazy.</v>

4058
03:00:18.840 --> 03:00:19.540
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4059
03:00:19.540 --> 03:00:22.140
<v Speaker 3>It's just lit up like you could actually</v>
<v Speaker 3>walk around in the dark,</v>

4060
03:00:22.141 --> 03:00:24.870
<v Speaker 3>just lit off the Milky Way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No Moon.</v>

4061
03:00:25.230 --> 03:00:26.063
<v Speaker 3>You could walk around in the dark up </v>
<v Speaker 3>there just because there's so many more </v>

4062
03:00:28.441 --> 03:00:31.440
<v Speaker 3>stars that you can see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy and you always come up to it.</v>

4063
03:00:32.070 --> 03:00:34.620
<v Speaker 3>There's the benefit of bonding people or</v>
<v Speaker 3>the outdoors.</v>

4064
03:00:34.621 --> 03:00:38.130
<v Speaker 3>Don't even get into Boeing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just go camping in that door's Nah,</v>

4065
03:00:38.131 --> 03:00:40.130
<v Speaker 3>you might have to go off a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's pretty cool though.</v>

4066
03:00:40.131 --> 03:00:44.010
<v Speaker 3>That was the camp that I had go up or </v>
<v Speaker 3>down.</v>

4067
03:00:44.640 --> 03:00:47.040
<v Speaker 3>I'm older.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Older.</v>

4068
03:00:49.150 --> 03:00:50.980
<v Speaker 3>That's a pretty good one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4069
03:00:52.160 --> 03:00:54.300
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my God.</v>

4070
03:00:54.910 --> 03:00:56.730
<v Speaker 3>It's like you're in a spaceship.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4071

<v Speaker 3>and not necessarily kill him because </v>

<v Speaker 3>just go to first man image.</v>

4077

<v Speaker 3>Australian way.</v>

4086
03:01:34.030 --> 03:01:35.350
<v Speaker 3>Is that what it is?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think so.</v>

4087
03:01:35.610 --> 03:01:38.230
<v Speaker 3>So it's Adam.green,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tree dot bowhunter.</v>

4088
03:01:38.260 --> 03:01:39.093
<v Speaker 3>If you're interested in looking at dead </v>
<v Speaker 3>animals and stars and if you just want </v>

4089
03:01:42.161 --> 03:01:43.600
<v Speaker 3>photography first,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

<v Speaker 3>dot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah man.</v>

4093
03:01:51.780 --> 03:01:53.500
<v Speaker 3>God Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He takes some pretty pictures.</v>

4094
03:01:53.501 --> 03:01:55.630
<v Speaker 3>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's amazing that you're self taught.</v>

4095
03:01:55.900 --> 03:01:56.733
<v Speaker 3>I've been thinking about it lately that </v>
<v Speaker 3>I need to get into photography at least </v>

4096
03:01:58.960 --> 03:02:02.750
<v Speaker 3>somewhat to just take pictures with your</v>
<v Speaker 3>iphone.</v>

4097
03:02:02.751 --> 03:02:05.530
<v Speaker 3>I just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the best when you do so much.</v>

4098
03:02:05.531 --> 03:02:06.364
<v Speaker 3>It's the best way to capture a memory </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I can look back on the photos </v>

4099
03:02:08.590 --> 03:02:09.700
<v Speaker 3>now and go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's right.</v>

4100
03:02:09.701 --> 03:02:11.050
<v Speaker 3>How cool is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or whatever.</v>

4101
03:02:11.980 --> 03:02:12.813
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes I do so much and I get carried</v>
<v Speaker 3>away with doing so much hunting that </v>

4102
03:02:15.520 --> 03:02:16.353
<v Speaker 3>it's lucky if I didn't take a photo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd actually forget that moment because </v>

4103
03:02:18.640 --> 03:02:19.930
<v Speaker 3>there's so much happening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

4104
03:02:20.380 --> 03:02:21.213
<v Speaker 3>And I just love showing it to my kids </v>
<v Speaker 3>and friends and people that are </v>

4105
03:02:23.201 --> 03:02:24.034
<v Speaker 3>interested in it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a really good promotion for the </v>

4106
03:02:26.291 --> 03:02:27.124
<v Speaker 3>sport.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4107
03:02:27.550 --> 03:02:28.600
<v Speaker 3>I used to think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

4108
03:02:28.780 --> 03:02:30.570
<v Speaker 3>do you call hunting and sport a dying?</v>

4109
03:02:30.730 --> 03:02:32.350
<v Speaker 3>I hate that word,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you just used it.</v>

4110
03:02:32.550 --> 03:02:33.570
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

4111
03:02:33.580 --> 03:02:35.980
<v Speaker 3>It's a common word that correct me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4112
03:02:35.981 --> 03:02:36.880
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4113
03:02:37.210 --> 03:02:40.240
<v Speaker 3>I feel like there's a word for it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like natural life,</v>

4114
03:02:40.320 --> 03:02:44.340
<v Speaker 3>like dismantle part of me or discipline.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think discipline is a better word for.</v>

4115
03:02:44.360 --> 03:02:45.880
<v Speaker 3>I hear the sport,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

4116
03:02:45.960 --> 03:02:48.200
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>welcome to the sport.</v>

4117
03:02:48.240 --> 03:02:49.760
<v Speaker 3>Glad you're getting involved in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>sport.</v>

4118
03:02:49.761 --> 03:02:50.594
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh.</v>

4119
03:02:50.980 --> 03:02:53.520
<v Speaker 3>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or we could call it a pause.</v>

4120
03:02:53.530 --> 03:02:57.730
<v Speaker 3>Time of cold pastime doesn't seem </v>
<v Speaker 3>significant enough.</v>

4121
03:02:57.760 --> 03:02:58.910
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4122
03:02:59.140 --> 03:03:02.150
<v Speaker 3>It seems like it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4123
03:03:02.160 --> 03:03:03.910
<v Speaker 3>you shoot an elk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that a pastime?</v>

4124
03:03:03.911 --> 03:03:05.770
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's way more than that.</v>

4125
03:03:06.030 --> 03:03:07.660
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

4126
03:03:07.750 --> 03:03:10.150
<v Speaker 3>a life experience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who I am,</v>

4127
03:03:10.460 --> 03:03:12.490
<v Speaker 3>what we are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then some.</v>

4128
03:03:12.491 --> 03:03:13.120
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4129
03:03:13.120 --> 03:03:15.070
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're getting into the sport,</v>

4130
03:03:15.590 --> 03:03:18.940
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to say it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're getting into bow hunting,</v>

4131
03:03:19.720 --> 03:03:22.330
<v Speaker 3>I guarantee you wish you found that 20 </v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago.</v>

4132
03:03:22.740 --> 03:03:23.540
<v Speaker 3>Bowhunting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4133
03:03:23.540 --> 03:03:24.900
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what,</v>

4134
03:03:24.910 --> 03:03:27.910
<v Speaker 3>I'm happy I found it when I found of </v>
<v Speaker 3>course so busy.</v>

4135
03:03:28.000 --> 03:03:28.833
<v Speaker 3>Always the height,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ID or if someone's going to go </v>

4136
03:03:30.401 --> 03:03:31.234
<v Speaker 3>through life and never find this </v>
<v Speaker 3>connection and that's the big push for </v>

4137
03:03:34.541 --> 03:03:35.374
<v Speaker 3>me to promote bowhunting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've written for the Australian outdoor </v>

4138
03:03:39.460 --> 03:03:40.293
<v Speaker 3>magazines for like 12 years now and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and a lot of people think it's like a </v>

4139
03:03:44.081 --> 03:03:45.610
<v Speaker 3>self promotion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I don't care.</v>

4140
03:03:45.900 --> 03:03:48.010
<v Speaker 3>I don't care if I didn't have any views </v>
<v Speaker 3>at all.</v>

4141
03:03:48.370 --> 03:03:52.480
<v Speaker 3>As long as people were getting a that </v>
<v Speaker 3>exposure,</v>

4142
03:03:52.481 --> 03:03:54.910
<v Speaker 3>I was putting that out there for people </v>
<v Speaker 3>to go,</v>

4143
03:03:54.911 --> 03:03:56.120
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I should try this.</v>

4144
03:03:56.121 --> 03:03:57.890
<v Speaker 3>It looks cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This dude's really enjoying it.</v>

4145
03:03:58.220 --> 03:04:01.670
<v Speaker 2>Here's the benefits in it and going and </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing it because it drives me nuts.</v>

4146
03:04:01.671 --> 03:04:04.820
<v Speaker 2>Just thinking that someone should have </v>
<v Speaker 2>that connection.</v>

4147
03:04:04.821 --> 03:04:07.460
<v Speaker 2>They just don't know it yet because a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of the guys,</v>

4148
03:04:07.461 --> 03:04:08.294
<v Speaker 2>especially the older guys that I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>introduced to bowhunting have always </v>

4149
03:04:11.811 --> 03:04:12.650
<v Speaker 2>been like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

4150
03:04:12.651 --> 03:04:14.480
<v Speaker 2>I would've never known about this </v>
<v Speaker 2>before,</v>

4151
03:04:14.481 --> 03:04:17.420
<v Speaker 2>and they've just got now I can't imagine</v>
<v Speaker 2>them as anything else,</v>

4152
03:04:17.421 --> 03:04:18.254
<v Speaker 2>but hunters because they just thrive on </v>
<v Speaker 2>it that much and has done so much for </v>

4153
03:04:21.351 --> 03:04:24.910
<v Speaker 2>their lives or just the outdoors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some guys that are gonna get into it,</v>

4154
03:04:24.911 --> 03:04:26.180
<v Speaker 2>try and been like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not for me,</v>

4155
03:04:26.181 --> 03:04:27.014
<v Speaker 2>but I really love camp and being out </v>
<v Speaker 2>there in the wilderness and even </v>

4156
03:04:29.331 --> 03:04:30.390
<v Speaker 2>archery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4157
03:04:30.430 --> 03:04:33.850
<v Speaker 2>definitely shooting a target for me is </v>
<v Speaker 2>like a form of therapy.</v>

4158
03:04:33.930 --> 03:04:35.110
<v Speaker 2>So Zen moment.</v>

4159
03:04:35.150 --> 03:04:35.983
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's so much concentration going on </v>

4160
03:04:37.611 --> 03:04:41.660
<v Speaker 1>that it cleanses your mind and if I can </v>
<v Speaker 1>shoot bows for an hour every day,</v>

4161
03:04:42.290 --> 03:04:42.921
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just,</v>

4162
03:04:42.921 --> 03:04:43.754
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

4163
03:04:44.020 --> 03:04:47.540
<v Speaker 1>it alleviates stress and some sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>strange like,</v>

4164
03:04:47.600 --> 03:04:49.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for lack of a better word.</v>

4165
03:04:49.251 --> 03:04:49.850
<v Speaker 1>Zen.</v>

4166
03:04:49.850 --> 03:04:50.810
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4167
03:04:50.900 --> 03:04:52.570
<v Speaker 2>Well it might be the best word for it </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually.</v>

4168
03:04:52.660 --> 03:04:55.430
<v Speaker 2>You were talking about earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like going out to the wilderness,</v>

4169
03:04:55.460 --> 03:04:57.690
<v Speaker 2>no technology or anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What it does,</v>

4170
03:04:57.691 --> 03:04:59.240
<v Speaker 2>the demand is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it frees the mind,</v>

4171
03:04:59.241 --> 03:05:02.630
<v Speaker 2>but like it's like it resets me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like hitting the reset button.</v>

4172
03:05:02.720 --> 03:05:04.640
<v Speaker 2>That's all good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all fresh now.</v>

4173
03:05:04.790 --> 03:05:07.280
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just gives you time to think,</v>

4174
03:05:07.360 --> 03:05:08.450
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4175
03:05:08.451 --> 03:05:08.780
<v Speaker 2>And even</v>

4176
03:05:08.780 --> 03:05:11.600
<v Speaker 1>people that aren't into hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I totally understand that.</v>

4177
03:05:11.601 --> 03:05:12.351
<v Speaker 1>And like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

4178
03:05:12.351 --> 03:05:13.184
<v Speaker 1>I've been really paying attention a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>to people that do these longterm hikes </v>

4179
03:05:18.021 --> 03:05:21.920
<v Speaker 1>and also overlanding people that just go</v>
<v Speaker 1>on these crazy adventures,</v>

4180
03:05:22.360 --> 03:05:23.193
<v Speaker 1>like they get off the beaten path and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they develop these vehicles that are </v>

4181
03:05:26.001 --> 03:05:26.834
<v Speaker 1>capable of driving over adverse </v>
<v Speaker 1>conditions and they just figured out a </v>

4182
03:05:30.711 --> 03:05:33.080
<v Speaker 1>way to live out there in the desert or </v>
<v Speaker 1>out in there.</v>

4183
03:05:33.090 --> 03:05:36.200
<v Speaker 1>The mountains.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fascinating to me because there's a</v>

4184
03:05:36.201 --> 03:05:37.034
<v Speaker 1>longing I think that people have to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>away from the concrete to get away from </v>

4185
03:05:39.801 --> 03:05:40.634
<v Speaker 1>the electricity and to just feel the </v>
<v Speaker 1>stillness of the actual world </v>

4186
03:05:45.770 --> 03:05:47.510
<v Speaker 1>uninhibited,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unencumbered,</v>

4187
03:05:47.550 --> 03:05:48.383
<v Speaker 1>and an an uncompressed by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by civilization and buildings and </v>

4188
03:05:56.720 --> 03:05:59.060
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you're out there,</v>

4189
03:05:59.120 --> 03:05:59.690
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

4190
03:05:59.690 --> 03:06:02.330
<v Speaker 1>I've never done what you've done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you're out there for 11 days,</v>

4191
03:06:02.331 --> 03:06:04.760
<v Speaker 1>you don't even talk to anybody for 11 </v>
<v Speaker 1>days</v>

4192
03:06:04.780 --> 03:06:05.613
<v Speaker 2>this side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this trip I did because I had internet </v>

4193
03:06:07.841 --> 03:06:10.620
<v Speaker 2>service at the top or a reception and I </v>

<v Speaker 2>Need to do.</v>

4201
03:06:21.320 --> 03:06:24.490
<v Speaker 2>If you listen to next year,</v>

<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

4203
03:06:26.710 --> 03:06:28.090
<v Speaker 2>But then some dude's going to be talking</v>
<v Speaker 2>to you.</v>

4204
03:06:28.091 --> 03:06:30.010
<v Speaker 2>I'm not playing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the rules.</v>

4205
03:06:30.011 --> 03:06:32.240
<v Speaker 2>He can't talk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got to have your campsite.</v>

4206
03:06:32.260 --> 03:06:37.260
<v Speaker 2>And she jump in if a bears is trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>eat healthy.</v>

4207
03:06:39.280 --> 03:06:40.660
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that sucked.</v>

4208
03:06:40.661 --> 03:06:41.830
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

4209
03:06:42.040 --> 03:06:45.790
<v Speaker 2>I've had trips where you don't talk to </v>
<v Speaker 2>people for days and days on end and just</v>

4210
03:06:45.791 --> 03:06:46.624
<v Speaker 2>the fact of a common back into </v>
<v Speaker 2>civilization and opening your mouth </v>

4211
03:06:49.450 --> 03:06:50.470
<v Speaker 2>feels weird.</v>

4212
03:06:51.750 --> 03:06:54.850
<v Speaker 2>It feels absolutely we'd even,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're talking up there,</v>

4213
03:06:54.851 --> 03:06:56.680
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

4214
03:06:56.730 --> 03:06:57.550
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4215
03:06:57.550 --> 03:06:59.610
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you're talking to the phone,</v>

4216
03:06:59.660 --> 03:07:00.331
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

4217
03:07:00.331 --> 03:07:01.164
<v Speaker 2>I'm up here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just told myself every now and then </v>

4218
03:07:03.211 --> 03:07:05.760
<v Speaker 2>you do you seriously every now and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd be like,</v>

4219
03:07:05.930 --> 03:07:06.763
<v Speaker 2>Nah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just.</v>

4220
03:07:06.770 --> 03:07:08.760
<v Speaker 2>Then you think like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what did I say that out loud?</v>

4221
03:07:09.090 --> 03:07:11.340
<v Speaker 2>Because you haven't interacted with </v>
<v Speaker 2>anyone for so long.</v>

4222
03:07:11.680 --> 03:07:12.780
<v Speaker 2>It would be something like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

4223
03:07:12.781 --> 03:07:16.760
<v Speaker 2>you fell over you frigging dummy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which happened a few times.</v>

4224
03:07:16.860 --> 03:07:18.470
<v Speaker 2>You definitely don't want to break a leg</v>
<v Speaker 2>up there.</v>

4225
03:07:18.750 --> 03:07:21.060
<v Speaker 2>You'd be screwed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You bring a satellite phone.</v>

4226
03:07:21.240 --> 03:07:22.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a satellite phone.</v>

4227
03:07:22.790 --> 03:07:24.420
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in case shit goes bad.</v>

4228
03:07:24.450 --> 03:07:26.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's got an SOS button built into it</v>

4229
03:07:27.500 --> 03:07:29.790
<v Speaker 2>that I even say it to Kim,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my wife,</v>

4230
03:07:29.791 --> 03:07:32.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you don't see that side of things,</v>

4231
03:07:32.341 --> 03:07:36.050
<v Speaker 2>but I do actually take precautions to </v>
<v Speaker 2>take us sat phone.</v>
