7
00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.310
Shazamm Russell Peters is in the house bitches along with his friend Jr straight

8
00:00:23.881 --> 00:00:26.670
out of London,
straight out of the dirty streets,

9
00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:27.673
<v 1>London,</v>

10
00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:36.960
<v 0>Ladies and gentlemen,
internationally known and locally accepted.</v>

11
00:00:36.961 --> 00:00:41.160
Russell Peters isn't the house my brother,
let's go in on,
what's the word,

12
00:00:41.161 --> 00:00:44.280
younger fella who were just talking about how we were in a grocery store or it

13
00:00:44.281 --> 00:00:48.750
was like a little convenience store and Vancouver and there was only 20 bucks in

14
00:00:48.751 --> 00:00:52.110
this little tiny little shelf that they had their,
you know,
the limited amount,

15
00:00:52.111 --> 00:00:56.160
like a couple of Dean coon's books,
some old lady romance books and Bam,

16
00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.210
Russell Peters,
Ladies and gentlemen,
you bear book,
what's it called?
Men,
why?

17
00:01:00.211 --> 00:01:03.570
It's called funny.
You should ask Joe.
It's called call me Russell.

18
00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:05.530
Call me Russell for poor people.

19
00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.350
There's people that still are not aware of the full Russell Peters experience.

20
00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.420
There's a lot of,
let's call them white people,

21
00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.160
but a lot of people that don't realize you are probably right now the most

22
00:01:17.161 --> 00:01:19.260
successful comedian in the world.

23
00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.850
Like who does more internationally than you?
I don't think anybody does.

24
00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:28.320
I think the only person that comes close is,
what's the guy with the puppets?
Oh,

25
00:01:28.321 --> 00:01:31.770
Jeff Dunham.
Jeff Dunham does.
He wrote were internationally.
He's,

26
00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.630
he works really loud.
Yeah,
to just baffled.

27
00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:40.500
I've never heard of him apart from like on the Internet and stuff.

28
00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:43.770
Well that could be the same response people have for me too.

29
00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:48.570
I find that London is London who is one of the smartest cities I think I've ever

30
00:01:48.571 --> 00:01:52.830
done.
Comedy and not London is a very smart city.
It's a very intelligent city.

31
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.880
I couldn't see that puppet show going on over in London.
I might be wrong.

32
00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.570
You said?
I think he wouldn't ever did Edinburgh festival,

33
00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.460
but outside that I have no knowledge of him gigging anyway,
so he's like,

34
00:02:05.461 --> 00:02:08.760
he like he couldn't do the o two and lots of us was in,
in,
in the UK last year.

35
00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:11.730
He did two sold out night for the l two which is on the,

36
00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.740
I'm certainly not hating on them,
by the way.
Sam,
this is awesome.

37
00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:17.403
What does it say?

38
00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.180
Russell Peters said the green card to her live from the o two arena in London.

39
00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.170
I know.
Interesting fact.
I had Michael Buffer do my intro that night.
Really?

40
00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.500
Did Bruce feel like you were cheating on him?
Well,
no.
That's how I actually met.

41
00:02:28.501 --> 00:02:29.334
Bruce was from my,

42
00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.780
from a hiring Michael to do that and then Bruce and I became friends.
Oh Wow.

43
00:02:33.781 --> 00:02:35.640
That's funny.
Yeah.
Bruce was going to do,

44
00:02:35.641 --> 00:02:38.760
there was some guy was trying to organize something for Bruce to introduce me in

45
00:02:38.761 --> 00:02:41.160
Vancouver,
but I'm like,
man,
that's just too much crossover.

46
00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.750
That's just getting too weird,
but learn the lines too.
It's too in your world,

47
00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.980
but I shouldn't,
I,
you know,

48
00:02:46.981 --> 00:02:49.560
I'm not hating on Jeff Dunham when we were saying that like that I would be

49
00:02:49.561 --> 00:02:51.180
surprised as act would go over in London,

50
00:02:51.181 --> 00:02:52.770
but I always thought of him as more of like,

51
00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.090
sort of like a kid's comedian or like a real family comedian,
you know,
just like,

52
00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.010
like what's his name is Willie.
I got like,

53
00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.090
I have no problem with people at puppets.

54
00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.630
<v 2>No,
no,
no.
I like it.
All right.
It doesn't,
it doesn't look on the radio though,</v>

55
00:03:04.631 --> 00:03:05.464
I find.

56
00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.810
<v 0>Yeah,
man.
Yeah.
But like if you ever seen Natto in George [inaudible],</v>

57
00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:15.240
George,
isn't that the guy with the puppet,
the black guy?
No,
no,
no.

58
00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:17.410
I know is you're thinking of Willie Tyler and last,

59
00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:21.300
that's why I was thinking Willy Taekwondo and George is a guy out in New York

60
00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.250
and auto has been around for a long time.
I know his name.
We did.
Um,
these,

61
00:03:26.251 --> 00:03:29.490
uh,
Dangerfield prom shows where you used to,

62
00:03:29.491 --> 00:03:32.250
the way they used to do it is the show would start at like whatever,

63
00:03:32.251 --> 00:03:33.390
seven o'clock,
eight o'clock,

64
00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.600
and they would continually pump in more prompt students.

65
00:03:36.601 --> 00:03:37.980
They never got him out of there.

66
00:03:37.981 --> 00:03:40.290
They're just pump new ones in there and forced them to leave.

67
00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.160
Everyone was talking and everyone's standing up.
Al Lou Belle was on stage.

68
00:03:44.161 --> 00:03:44.994
The guy got on stage,

69
00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:48.660
took the microphone away from him and blue cigar smoke has faced some big

70
00:03:48.661 --> 00:03:51.240
fucking high school football kid.
I mean,
it was just,

71
00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.820
it was the craziest gigs you could ever do.

72
00:03:53.821 --> 00:03:57.010
And I did them with that guy and he has a,
he's like got an evil poppy,

73
00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:01.580
like the pub.
We'll say fucked up shit.
And he'll say,
hey,
what are you saying?

74
00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.950
Yeah,
that's all.
Yeah,
but he's a master of it.

75
00:04:04.951 --> 00:04:07.410
I think all those people that do puppet acts,

76
00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:08.940
nobody can fuck with auto and George,

77
00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:11.370
nobody's made me laugh more consistently than that guy.

78
00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:15.090
That's where the puppet insults the puppeteer.
He insults everybody.

79
00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:19.130
<v 3>Hey,
what do you mean I got a small Dick?
You can't say that.
Yes I can.</v>

80
00:04:19.131 --> 00:04:19.964
I've seen it.

81
00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.861
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

82
00:04:21.861 --> 00:04:25.160
Puppets are supposed to be saying shit that you feel uncomfortable about saying

83
00:04:25.161 --> 00:04:27.290
it and then you make the puppets and you go,
hey,

84
00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:29.020
<v 3>hey,
you know what?
That would be good for,
uh,</v>

85
00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:32.110
for nowadays because with all the political correctness and everybody coming

86
00:04:32.111 --> 00:04:36.350
down on everybody for fucking,
that'd be great.
Using their words.
True.
Tracy,

87
00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:42.060
<v 0>Tracy Morgan is going to Nashville now to stand in front of all these gay,</v>

88
00:04:42.061 --> 00:04:44.550
lesbian alliance people and standpoints and

89
00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:49.620
<v 2>just to prove his point and he's going to,</v>

90
00:04:49.621 --> 00:04:53.040
apparently he's gonna to make some big ass apology.
It's why.
Yeah.

91
00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:55.410
I don't understand this.
I will talk about this the other day.

92
00:04:55.411 --> 00:04:57.450
I don't understand it in stand up.

93
00:04:57.451 --> 00:05:01.890
You're meant to be able to say what you want and I'll just explain to people

94
00:05:01.891 --> 00:05:03.450
right now that don't know the story.

95
00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:06.490
Just tell everybody what the story is tomorrow.

96
00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:10.290
A knowledge a couple of little bit.
Last week,
two weeks ago,
two weeks ago,

97
00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:15.240
he was doing the show and he did the show and he said that if he's,

98
00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:18.450
if he heard his,
one of his son talking gay,
he would stab him.

99
00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:21.040
<v 3>Yeah.
The Sun came out and said I was gay with stab them to death.</v>

100
00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:25.370
But you know that it wasn't said like that.
It wasn't said in a serious tone.

101
00:05:25.371 --> 00:05:27.900
He said,
yeah,

102
00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.700
it's exactly what [inaudible] yo,

103
00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:33.790
that's crazy be I was stabbed I little motherfucker.

104
00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:38.860
<v 2>Now if he said that on,
on,
on Larry King or on the tonight show or,</v>

105
00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:42.220
or I don't know,
CNN,
whatever.
I could understand that.

106
00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:45.690
But he's saying it in a show as part of the joke and whatever.

107
00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:47.260
<v 3>And you knew it was like a black room.</v>

108
00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:51.740
You have to say the outlandish shit though.
You can't just be like,
man,

109
00:05:51.741 --> 00:05:54.290
I would just embrace him.
I mean,
they gotta go,

110
00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:58.100
you gotta go way the fuck over the line.
If you can't see

111
00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:02.840
<v 2>the exaggeration in that one.
Come on.
Even in the UK sort of like,</v>

112
00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:06.450
you know,
black people and we move is up in the black people in America.
Um,

113
00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:09.470
we would expect something of that kind of ilk,
you know what I mean?

114
00:06:09.471 --> 00:06:13.210
We wouldn't have figured out exactly.
Sorry,
I can hurt a black guy.

115
00:06:13.211 --> 00:06:16.760
Say I have to explain it.
This a shot.
I shot an elk,

116
00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:21.213
fried it up.

117
00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:22.443
<v 0>Nah,</v>

118
00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:26.700
there's something going on lately that where people are way more sensitive.

119
00:06:26.701 --> 00:06:29.020
Jo Koy gender,
whatever.
What did he get in trouble for

120
00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:32.670
<v 3>saying faggot?
Yeah.
Oh my God.
He and,
and his was the,</v>

121
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.830
the worst thing for Jo Koy is,
um,
it was like said so casually and in a,

122
00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:40.200
and it's not like it's specific.

123
00:06:40.201 --> 00:06:43.740
Jo Koy it's probably something any comic in that situation would have said to

124
00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:48.090
apparently Joe coys fly was down on stage and somebody said,
hey,
your flies down.

125
00:06:48.091 --> 00:06:51.570
Some other guy went,
yeah,
you're flies down and gentlemen.
Oh,
he like that faggot.

126
00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:55.350
That was it.
And then he continued on with this act.
It wasn't like any,

127
00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:58.410
it was just so people got mad at him for saying that some writer was in the

128
00:06:58.411 --> 00:07:02.820
crowd gain lesbian writer and ended up on Huffington Post and Perez Hilton.

129
00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:04.830
And then here's the worst part.

130
00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:09.030
Joe was one of the lead actors and Chelsea's knew a sitcom on NBC.

131
00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:11.200
NBC fired him.
What

132
00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:15.140
<v 2>does that mean that before that,
can we just go on stage?
Now we have to say that.</v>

133
00:07:15.141 --> 00:07:17.180
Well,
you're a faggot.
Is that basically it?

134
00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:19.410
<v 0>Yeah.
Shit.
Are you fucking,</v>

135
00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:20.660
<v 3>that's crazy,
right?</v>

136
00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:25.690
Holy Chef for best is going through a really rough time now and really if you've

137
00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:27.950
know Jo Koy,
the audience,

138
00:07:27.951 --> 00:07:30.930
99% of the audience thinks he's gay anyway when he walks out,
right?

139
00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:31.681
<v 0>Yeah.
Look,</v>

140
00:07:31.681 --> 00:07:35.250
he's just trying to get a laugh out of a weird moment where someone's heckling

141
00:07:35.251 --> 00:07:38.250
him,
man.
Just see cause you fucked up and said the wrong thing.

142
00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:41.760
That's not like a statement.
It's not like he's releasing a press statement.

143
00:07:41.761 --> 00:07:44.670
This is something I've carefully considered and a,
you're a faggot.

144
00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:46.260
You know what I'm saying?
I mean,

145
00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:49.220
this is just him trying to be funny in the heat of the moment.

146
00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:52.450
<v 3>Yeah.
I mean,
I say it all the time just to my friends,
like I just,</v>

147
00:07:52.451 --> 00:07:54.220
it's just one of those things and it's not even like,
you know,

148
00:07:54.221 --> 00:07:58.480
like Louis C k said,
you know,
it's not like we mean anything negative,

149
00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:00.910
but it's like,
you know,
you just like your friend and be like,
yeah,

150
00:08:00.911 --> 00:08:02.980
I got to go and take my wife to the mall faggot.

151
00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:09.220
And you say it at the Times where it has nothing to do with being gay.
Queer.

152
00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:13.710
<v 0>It was beeped out of my,
my TV special,
the only word that we,</v>

153
00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:18.280
it was uncensored on comedy central from 11:00 PM on and on.
Spike TV.
Same thing.

154
00:08:18.281 --> 00:08:22.060
11:00 PM on,
you can say anything except faggot.
They beeped out.

155
00:08:22.061 --> 00:08:25.920
Faggot Nigga.
You could say mother never said nigger.
It wasn't in the out.

156
00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:28.650
I didn't test that.
I bet they would've beat that too.
They do it.

157
00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:31.840
They wouldn't allow that.
But they allowed fuck and shit.

158
00:08:31.841 --> 00:08:36.730
Suck my cock and the craziest shit ever.
I don't know.
I didn't say cons,

159
00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:40.660
but they sat on sensor,
they said uncensored except hate speech.

160
00:08:40.661 --> 00:08:43.300
And they said that fag,
it was hate speech.
And this is the craziest thing,

161
00:08:43.301 --> 00:08:47.530
and this is true.
The Guy,
the network said it's our word.
And I said,
what?

162
00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:51.850
And he goes,
it's our nigger.
He goes,
only were allowed to say it.
I go,

163
00:08:51.851 --> 00:08:54.040
that is the gay shit I've ever heard in my life.

164
00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:55.860
And that was a real conversation.
I

165
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:59.100
<v 4>really said it to me like it's our nigger.
And I'm like,
get the fuck Outta here.</v>

166
00:08:59.101 --> 00:09:04.030
It is not as an England cigarettes or fags.
Yeah,
yeah.
That's it.
Well,

167
00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:07.500
and not only not in England,
the word cunt comes flying out every five minutes.

168
00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:12.170
If you're out drinking,
as this says he's a Brit.
Great Con.
Telefind.
Yeah,

169
00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:16.320
if you're not,
you're not down.
Well,

170
00:09:16.321 --> 00:09:18.420
I think England is a much better use of it then.
We're doing,

171
00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:24.360
we're speaking anyway.
I'll let you eat.
We're hiding from it.
Ooh,
don't say it.

172
00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:27.030
It's called the greater country.
And I got in trouble.

173
00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:31.380
I just said this writer's cunty or writing his country and everybody was so

174
00:09:31.381 --> 00:09:35.640
fucking angry,
mean crazy.
And I'm like,
you guys need to relax,
man.
This is,

175
00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:38.520
this is just a silly word.
You know,
if I said Bitchy,

176
00:09:38.521 --> 00:09:43.140
I would've meant the exact same thing.
I didn't country sounds less a mean.

177
00:09:43.141 --> 00:09:47.540
That bitchy ain't fact.
Yeah.
It's like bitchy implies you're a bitch.
Khan Khan's.

178
00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:52.170
You're just being country though.
It's playful,

179
00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:55.070
it's playful.
It's like if you,
the way I say it is a,
you've,

180
00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:57.960
you'd go up to someone's daughter or go up to someone and say,

181
00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:01.230
your daughter's a cunt.
You know,
like he would have been way,
what the fuck?

182
00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:03.530
But if you go up to someone and say,
Hey,
your daughter's a little container,

183
00:10:03.531 --> 00:10:06.380
and you're like,
yeah,
yeah,
I got to grow up with her kid.

184
00:10:06.381 --> 00:10:10.200
Can't he makes it sound like,
exactly.
You should meet her mother.

185
00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:13.770
And I was one of those things.
It's like,
yeah,
you know,
chasing,

186
00:10:13.771 --> 00:10:18.260
get cunty my cat can get cunty.
My cat gets conti and my car gets county,

187
00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:22.290
but it's not a cunt.
Right.
This is a big goddamn difference.

188
00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:27.810
People are so fucking sensitive.
It continues to just cut like a con Twitter.

189
00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:30.170
Similarly,
like

190
00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:36.450
my Ford edge is a faggot all the time.
Is it?
Yeah.

191
00:10:36.451 --> 00:10:40.560
15 miles a gallon for that fucking knew.
That's like you're ridiculous.

192
00:10:40.561 --> 00:10:43.380
You knew what you were getting into you,
but got an Seu bought a giant box,

193
00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:48.420
but back then it was $5 a gallon.
It was a little bit better than that.
Yeah,

194
00:10:48.421 --> 00:10:52.360
but it doesn't make your car gay.
It means you've planned out.
It's a faggot neck.

195
00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:57.530
Have a talk about your petrol prices over here.
Okay.

196
00:10:58.110 --> 00:11:00.390
Is it worse over there?
Oh my God.
Oh my God.

197
00:11:00.391 --> 00:11:03.510
England's been getting fucked in the ass on that for a long time and by fucked

198
00:11:03.511 --> 00:11:07.700
in the ass,
I don't mean anything.
Like what is it to a gallon over the,
okay,

199
00:11:08.270 --> 00:11:09.130
I have to do the calculation.

200
00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:14.180
What is it per liter ready is about one pound 41 40 40 is about $3 American,

201
00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:19.980
right?
Isn't that correct about bell 280280280 okay,

202
00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:23.340
and that's per liter.
How many liters?
Two liters and a gallon,
right?

203
00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:28.230
Isn't that worth over two lanes?
How many lights up?
4.5 liters to a gallon.

204
00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:32.130
Gas is like $8 a gallon plus eight 50 a gallon.

205
00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:35.220
Hold faggotry thank you very much.

206
00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:39.360
Thank you.
[inaudible] you can donate any,

207
00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:43.260
any guests to me whilst I'm here I'll take it back and just gave me a cookie

208
00:11:43.261 --> 00:11:45.700
with nuts and fruit and all.
We haven't enough cash short.
Like

209
00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:53.800
I got in trouble on Twitter the other day.
A bunch of people got mad at me

210
00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:58.980
<v 0>because a I posted,
I posted this study that showed that um,</v>

211
00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:04.260
very homophobic men are more likely to be aroused by gay porn.

212
00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:07.720
Did some sort of a study where they showed men they put like a sensor on their

213
00:12:07.721 --> 00:12:08.021
dick.

214
00:12:08.021 --> 00:12:12.040
They showed them all kinds of things and the guys that were really homophobic

215
00:12:12.041 --> 00:12:15.520
when they showed them like guys fucking,
they actually got excited.
Awesome.

216
00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:17.140
Which totally makes sense.
It's kind of like,

217
00:12:17.141 --> 00:12:21.690
and people that are a so anti whatever are usually kind of pro those paper.

218
00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:24.180
Exactly.
Almost always.
And so,
uh,

219
00:12:24.210 --> 00:12:28.300
I put that up on Twitter and I said another study that confirms something we

220
00:12:28.301 --> 00:12:32.560
already knew what's next.
Studied shows.
Many black people don't tip,
you know,

221
00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:33.821
so this is,

222
00:12:33.821 --> 00:12:37.810
I just put this on Twitter and this fucking one bitch sends me this Twitter

223
00:12:37.811 --> 00:12:40.030
message.
You fucking racist.

224
00:12:40.031 --> 00:12:43.490
I hope you have so many cuts your dick off and shoves it in your mouth.

225
00:12:44.050 --> 00:12:46.180
I was like,
Whoa,
Whoa,
whoa.
And then I said,

226
00:12:46.181 --> 00:12:50.050
note that I said many and before anybody even attacked me,
and I said,

227
00:12:50.051 --> 00:12:54.070
I'm not saying all just many like this isn't racist.
This is just truth.

228
00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:58.570
We know this.
This is a cultural fact.
There's many black people who do not tip.

229
00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:01.150
But what about black being from England?
That's a zero.
Yeah,

230
00:13:01.151 --> 00:13:04.570
but it's a cultural thing.
We went out for breakfast.
You have it in England.

231
00:13:04.571 --> 00:13:06.220
They don't tiptoe in America.

232
00:13:06.370 --> 00:13:09.820
Most people tip and it's like people feel like there's a lot of black people

233
00:13:09.821 --> 00:13:12.550
that go to restaurants that stiff them and it doesn't mean all of them.

234
00:13:12.551 --> 00:13:14.350
Old people were aware of the fact that you can't,

235
00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:17.640
you can't not talk about that because it makes some people upset because it's
so,

236
00:13:17.710 --> 00:13:20.710
it opens up the door for racism because I don't think it's being racist and just

237
00:13:20.711 --> 00:13:22.090
tell the truth.
Oh well that's what I say.

238
00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:24.290
That's why I talk about the things I talk about it.
Yeah.

239
00:13:24.310 --> 00:13:26.860
Your act is huge with that.
I mean you,
you,
you,

240
00:13:26.861 --> 00:13:30.370
you must have so many fucking people pissed off at you left and right all the

241
00:13:30.371 --> 00:13:31.990
time.
Funny with my fans is the eye.

242
00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:33.850
They get pissed off when I don't talk about them.

243
00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:36.880
But the one thing I've noticed about you is that you let me talk about the group

244
00:13:36.881 --> 00:13:39.080
that's in the room.
Yeah.
I don't

245
00:13:41.410 --> 00:13:42.370
feel like we're breaking up.

246
00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:50.230
I'll move in.
I'll do the side talk

247
00:13:53.090 --> 00:13:54.310
and what is going on?

248
00:13:54.311 --> 00:13:57.680
Why is everybody so fucking sensitive is it is it feels like it's escalating.

249
00:13:58.300 --> 00:14:01.740
The person that commented about Saint Clooney,
racism itself,
was it a,

250
00:14:01.741 --> 00:14:03.610
a black personal black girl

251
00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:08.430
and it kind of couple of black guys and they don't even know your situation.

252
00:14:08.650 --> 00:14:10.370
They don't know nothing about it.
That's the worst part.

253
00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:13.780
That's the part I actually find funny about that.
People are ridiculous.

254
00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:17.050
They always want to be mad for whatever reason.

255
00:14:17.051 --> 00:14:20.470
They always choose to be mad and there is a lot lost in text.

256
00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:23.590
You say something like that in text?
Yeah.
You don't hear tone,
right?

257
00:14:23.591 --> 00:14:27.190
If you were on stage and you said that the exact line,
people would laugh,

258
00:14:27.210 --> 00:14:30.580
they'll go,
oh,
you fucked up.
You shouldn't say that math.
But they'd be laughing.

259
00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:32.040
But when you write it down,

260
00:14:32.050 --> 00:14:35.410
it looks like you're like making some sort of a KKK statement.

261
00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:39.220
You know it's this,
it's fucking silly,
man.
Why we just,

262
00:14:39.310 --> 00:14:42.010
because there is racism and they're fucking most certainly is.

263
00:14:42.090 --> 00:14:44.550
It doesn't mean that black people are off limits for making fun of,

264
00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:49.420
that's fucking silly.
That's so racist.
Cut Somebody out.

265
00:14:49.710 --> 00:14:52.280
Making fun of him.
You shouldn't.
Black people shouldn't want that anyway.

266
00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:54.080
But that's what I like about what was Lucy Carol,

267
00:14:54.081 --> 00:14:57.240
one of your shows says about you hate when people use the n word instead of,

268
00:14:57.430 --> 00:15:02.430
not the Nigga but the n word because it makes him have to think of the word

269
00:15:02.901 --> 00:15:03.630
Nigga.

270
00:15:03.630 --> 00:15:07.070
And I think when you're trying to skirt around issues instead of just coming
out,

271
00:15:07.071 --> 00:15:10.690
I'm saying it plain then you,
you know,
you can't treat your origins like that.

272
00:15:10.691 --> 00:15:12.950
Children.
Exactly.

273
00:15:13.250 --> 00:15:18.050
I had a bit and one of my last cds about there's three magic words,
uh,

274
00:15:18.330 --> 00:15:19.580
con love and nigger.

275
00:15:19.850 --> 00:15:23.510
And the nigger is the only one that black people are only allowed to say.

276
00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:26.730
And it is some weird thing,
but if you say it,

277
00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:31.040
people feel like they are allowed to hit you or they're allowed to physically

278
00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:34.970
isn't.
Very few words that are that strong.
Where if you sat in front of someone,

279
00:15:34.971 --> 00:15:39.560
not even calling them someone just say,
boy,
there's a lot of niggers around here.

280
00:15:39.650 --> 00:15:43.600
They will jump on you and beat the fuck out of it.
I don't even know the word.

281
00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:46.460
I don't even know what snigger cause there's only one letter away from a fight.

282
00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:51.800
All right,
well how about niggardly you know that's a,
that's a terrible word.

283
00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:55.790
Stingy or for,
it's like frugal,
right?
Or something like that about Nigeria.

284
00:15:56.380 --> 00:16:01.260
<v 4>Yeah.
Yeah.
Nice.
You're please.
Yeah,
it's,</v>

285
00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:04.930
it's a weird thing,
man,
that we have.
I just call my friends Nigerians.
All right.

286
00:16:04.931 --> 00:16:08.260
I'll say nectarines later.
Well,
how about a Ninja

287
00:16:09.030 --> 00:16:13.260
<v 0>Use Ninja?
Like come on,
but when were on your,
um,
your def jam,</v>

288
00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:14.720
then you had a whole thing?

289
00:16:14.830 --> 00:16:17.230
<v 4>I did def jam.
Do you see my desk come down?
You did.
I did.</v>

290
00:16:17.231 --> 00:16:19.570
Definitely hear in oh seven.
Wow.

291
00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:22.840
<v 3>My whole set was about the word nigger</v>

292
00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:28.540
<v 4>out of 800 black.
Wow.
Whoa.
Let's take it a chance.</v>

293
00:16:28.541 --> 00:16:32.620
I know that's my inner fight are coming out to go and get tan more before you

294
00:16:32.621 --> 00:16:37.510
went on stage.
Now I broke it down for them because you are Indian Bro.

295
00:16:37.750 --> 00:16:41.550
You can confuse the fuck out of some dudes with the right haircut.

296
00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:45.120
That Mexican dude with the big nose was.
Yeah,
man,
he was ballsy.

297
00:16:45.121 --> 00:16:48.340
You just fucking rock a high top fade and come in there with some fucking

298
00:16:48.341 --> 00:16:51.880
converse all stars on you.
Confused the fuck out of a lot of people.

299
00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:57.100
It went well.
It was was the opening joke.

300
00:16:57.520 --> 00:17:00.320
Well the,
I don't want to make you do it,
but what was the whole case?
The

301
00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:05.360
<v 3>thing was about how white people don't want black people do use the n word and</v>

302
00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:08.310
and and,
and the whole thing is I say,
you know,

303
00:17:08.311 --> 00:17:10.950
it's easy enough for white people to stop saying it cause they created in the

304
00:17:10.951 --> 00:17:13.590
first place I go,
but they're going to come up with some shift.

305
00:17:13.591 --> 00:17:15.720
They can come up with that the first time they're going to come up with some

306
00:17:15.721 --> 00:17:18.250
shit that they're going to say right in front of you and you're not even going

307
00:17:18.251 --> 00:17:21.630
to know it.
They'll be like,
excuse me,
could you pass the vinegar?

308
00:17:22.860 --> 00:17:27.570
And then when I was in Boston,
there's a true story was this white dude.
I said,

309
00:17:27.571 --> 00:17:30.390
here's a prime example of white people coming up with words that you don't know

310
00:17:30.391 --> 00:17:33.210
about.
It's white to kill it.
And he said,
how's it going over there?
And uh,

311
00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:35.400
with the comedy thing and going through I was pretty good.
And I go,

312
00:17:35.401 --> 00:17:38.760
actually I'm doing not def jam next week.
DEF Jam isn't there for the Mondays.

313
00:17:38.790 --> 00:17:42.590
And I go for what?
For the Mondays I go,
I don't know when they air.
He goes,
Nah,

314
00:17:42.610 --> 00:17:46.170
know how to fuck on Mondays.
I love that show.
I go,
the fuck is a Monday.

315
00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:48.270
He goes after what we call black people around here.
I go,

316
00:17:48.271 --> 00:17:49.710
what if I go on Mondays?
He goes,

317
00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:54.020
<v 4>cause nobody likes Mondays.
Oh my God.</v>

318
00:17:54.021 --> 00:17:58.820
So that was my closing bit.
Ah,
that's hilarious.
I guess standing on,

319
00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:03.300
that's some waitress said that in Vegas cocktail,

320
00:18:03.301 --> 00:18:06.720
which is called black people celebrities.
I've heard they call them Canadians.

321
00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:10.630
Canadians heard the column Canadian because Canadians,
I've heard that too.
Yeah,

322
00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:13.440
not me of course.
But up in Canada,
do people tip?

323
00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:17.000
I always tipping them up generously.
It's not the same.
Okay.

324
00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:19.590
I tipped quite generously cause cause I don't want people to go,

325
00:18:19.770 --> 00:18:23.330
Russell Peters was here.
What a fucking douchebag.
Yeah,
exactly what I mean,

326
00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:26.610
I do the same thing.
Okay.
Well,
selfishly,
whilst I'm here help a brother,

327
00:18:26.611 --> 00:18:30.180
20% to 20% that's what I do and it was a bottle of wine.

328
00:18:30.181 --> 00:18:34.290
It was that I going to give me 20% extra food.
No,

329
00:18:34.291 --> 00:18:37.410
but you know you to look at it in terms of the,
the wait staff,

330
00:18:37.411 --> 00:18:38.310
it's not their fault.

331
00:18:38.370 --> 00:18:41.430
The restaurant charges x amount of money per hamburger or whatever.

332
00:18:41.431 --> 00:18:45.120
You know the wait staff is working for,
they don't make money.
Minimum wage.

333
00:18:45.210 --> 00:18:47.970
<v 3>Yeah.
Like the other day,
I don't even get that man.
They get,
they have to pay,</v>

334
00:18:48.030 --> 00:18:52.050
their paychecks are usually zero or like a dollar because they make $2 an hour

335
00:18:52.051 --> 00:18:55.860
that just pays the tax and so they,
they pretty much only make whatever,

336
00:18:56.250 --> 00:18:58.930
<v 4>it's still illegal.
These still,
I knew none of the,
yeah,
that's why.</v>

337
00:18:58.931 --> 00:19:00.240
That's why I still do it.
Like,
yeah.

338
00:19:00.250 --> 00:19:03.040
That's why waitresses are what they work on tips.

339
00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:05.190
That shit is ridiculous because that's just like,

340
00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:07.220
just because a waiter can make a lot of money,

341
00:19:07.221 --> 00:19:10.030
it doesn't mean you shouldn't pay him to be working in your fucking bar.

342
00:19:10.031 --> 00:19:12.610
That's ridiculous.
Just because they can make a lot of money on tips.

343
00:19:12.611 --> 00:19:16.300
Doesn't mean you shouldn't be paying them to work for you.
It should be illegal.

344
00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:20.230
<v 3>We went to Jerry's and they didn't have anything I fucking ordered on the menu</v>

345
00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:21.550
and she wasn't a good waitress,

346
00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:24.500
but I still left her a nice tip and union was like,
yeah,
I go down to age,

347
00:19:24.501 --> 00:19:26.830
still going to tip her.
I'm like,
you got to.
Yeah.

348
00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:30.000
<v 4>Yeah,
that makes sense to me.
That don't tip.</v>

349
00:19:31.010 --> 00:19:35.150
Have you ever waited tables?
No.
Do it.
Do it for five years.

350
00:19:37.150 --> 00:19:41.470
Perfect accent.
The waiting tables,
people you respect and trust and English.

351
00:19:41.550 --> 00:19:46.040
Welcome to El Pollo Loco
and American.
Where you live.

352
00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:50.930
You live in London?
Uh,
not live.
I live about 150 miles north of London now.
Okay.

353
00:19:50.931 --> 00:19:55.250
So,
but you grew up around that sort of area.
How often are you in America?
Oh,

354
00:19:56.580 --> 00:20:01.520
well,
three,
four years ago.
What's the biggest difference?
Um,

355
00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:05.200
gas prices.
Um,
price of everything.
Yeah.
And also the,

356
00:20:05.420 --> 00:20:09.680
the service that you get over here is fast and period.
Then it says tips.
Yeah.

357
00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:12.290
That's why you got tip people.
Yeah.
Have you ever,

358
00:20:12.291 --> 00:20:14.960
had you ever gone to a restaurant in England?
Oh my God.
It's the worst.

359
00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:19.020
It's not that bad,
but it wasn't.
I think,
um,
our freedom speeches

360
00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:23.310
<v 3>is if it's false superior than other here though freedom of speech and the rest</v>

361
00:20:23.311 --> 00:20:24.900
of the world.
That's why when I,

362
00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:28.170
when I watch these things on the news and I'm like in there and we've got to get

363
00:20:28.171 --> 00:20:28.681
the terrorist,

364
00:20:28.681 --> 00:20:31.500
they're out from thereafter our freedoms and they're mad that we have these

365
00:20:31.501 --> 00:20:34.350
friends.
I'm like,
you don't have any,
I've been in the Middle East.

366
00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:36.670
They've got way more fucking freedom than that.
You're doing American.
Really?

367
00:20:36.671 --> 00:20:40.410
You think so?
Fuck.
Like what?
How do they have more freedom of freedom of speech?

368
00:20:40.411 --> 00:20:45.060
You can that kind of shit.
Fuck yeah,
you can.
Here's the thing.
In America,

369
00:20:45.330 --> 00:20:47.470
there's only certain things that are off limits.
Uh,

370
00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:50.260
you can talk about Muslims all day,
but you can't talk about Jews.

371
00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:52.450
You go to the Middle East,
you can't talk about Muslims,

372
00:20:52.451 --> 00:20:55.300
but you can talk about Jews all day.
You know what I mean?
Right.

373
00:20:55.650 --> 00:21:00.220
It's just the exact opposite.
But
in the Middle East,
you talk to him.

374
00:21:00.370 --> 00:21:03.960
I don't,
I don't bother with it because not my business,
but because it,

375
00:21:04.010 --> 00:21:09.010
fuck that shit leaks back to America and she will get you fired in the future.

376
00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:12.200
Yeah,
right.
They'll hold some future contracts over you and fire you,

377
00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:14.950
but you know,
you can really say whatever.
I said,
whatever the fuck I want,

378
00:21:15.130 --> 00:21:18.360
<v 0>but don't you think that it's more dangerous over there?
And we're just like,</v>

379
00:21:18.361 --> 00:21:22.020
we've had guys that did sets like what's it did?
How sparks tell us that,

380
00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:23.400
how sparks went over there,
man,

381
00:21:23.401 --> 00:21:28.020
they were going to lock him up in jail because he referred to one of the,
uh,

382
00:21:28.350 --> 00:21:29.850
what it,
what is it?
One of the prime,

383
00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:33.900
what centers are a member of the religious family?
Some high,

384
00:21:34.530 --> 00:21:39.530
all he did was call him Sir or miss you or something like that.

385
00:21:40.110 --> 00:21:44.880
He,
yeah,
he referred to them in a formal way,
but in not the correct way.

386
00:21:44.881 --> 00:21:47.800
It's not like you're royalty or whatever you're supposed to say.
You're,
you're,

387
00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:50.370
you're,
ah,
what have you,
what are you supposed to call them?
Your Highness,

388
00:21:50.371 --> 00:21:52.590
Your Highness,
Your Majesty.
It's one of those things,

389
00:21:52.591 --> 00:21:56.040
like if you don't refer to him as that,
they'll lock you up in a fucking jail.

390
00:21:56.130 --> 00:21:57.990
And the club owner was telling him,
look,

391
00:21:58.050 --> 00:22:00.600
we'll probably be able to be able to get you out by tomorrow,

392
00:22:00.601 --> 00:22:03.300
but you're going to have to post bail and you might have to leave the country.

393
00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:05.960
And he was like,
what?
And when someone's a little bit,

394
00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:08.490
and they didn't even get hurt.
Someone complained.

395
00:22:08.550 --> 00:22:12.860
They called the religious police.
So they showed up.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So,
um,

396
00:22:13.180 --> 00:22:16.740
it was with the religious police,
political,
whatever the fuck police it was.

397
00:22:16.820 --> 00:22:19.500
They showed up and they were going to lock this guy up.

398
00:22:19.501 --> 00:22:23.220
But members of the royal family were there and they were laughing with them and

399
00:22:23.221 --> 00:22:25.140
they were talking about how funny they thought his act was.

400
00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:28.800
And so then the policeman went,
the,
the royal family thought it was funny.

401
00:22:28.830 --> 00:22:31.230
We're not going to lock them up.
This is stupid.
This is ridiculous.

402
00:22:32.150 --> 00:22:34.490
<v 3>It's really about,
you know,
who it's the same.</v>

403
00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:37.230
<v 0>So like what's going on now?
People just decide to be upset.</v>

404
00:22:37.350 --> 00:22:38.670
They decided to be outraged.

405
00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:42.150
<v 3>Yeah.
But it's,
it's,
it's,
it's less over there,
you know what I mean?</v>

406
00:22:42.151 --> 00:22:44.710
I don't feel any pressure on a narrow.
They really,
they are,

407
00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:45.960
they only thing they tell you is,
listen,

408
00:22:45.961 --> 00:22:50.160
don't talk about the royal family and don't talk about Islam.
I'm like,
cool.
Yeah,

409
00:22:50.161 --> 00:22:54.030
but I don't know either of them.
Perfect for me.
I feel like,
I don't know.

410
00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:58.110
<v 0>Yeah.
But I still think that their,
their freedom of speech is it's,
I mean,</v>

411
00:22:58.140 --> 00:23:02.470
they live in their marquee.
They have kings.
I mean basically,
I mean they

412
00:23:02.890 --> 00:23:05.080
<v 3>part like,
I mean when I hung up,
hung out with the king of Jordan,</v>

413
00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:10.750
like he had me over to his,
to the palace and cooked me dinner.

414
00:23:10.950 --> 00:23:13.150
<v 0>Oh,
the lean pockets.
No,</v>

415
00:23:15.310 --> 00:23:17.490
he had these cookies with nuts and fruit.

416
00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:23.250
Dude,
you are hanging out with the prince of Jordan.
King,
King of Jordan.

417
00:23:23.250 --> 00:23:27.630
<v 3>The prince was there,
but the king and the queen.
Wow.
Wow.
And what does that,</v>

418
00:23:27.631 --> 00:23:30.150
let me tell you about this.
He's cool as shit.
Really.

419
00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:31.470
He's the one of the coolest dudes I've ever.

420
00:23:31.471 --> 00:23:33.480
How many do you think he's killed in his lifetime?

421
00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:37.860
I don't think it's probably his family has he,
he's pretty chill dude.

422
00:23:37.861 --> 00:23:41.910
Finger off the trigger and he went to school in Boston.
Really?
Yeah.
Wow.
He,

423
00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:43.920
he grew up outside of Jordan for the most

424
00:23:44.010 --> 00:23:47.930
<v 4>what a lucky roll the dice to be a royal member.
Royal Family member.</v>

425
00:23:47.931 --> 00:23:51.890
You wake up here,
the prince?
Yeah,
he's a,
but that's the thing I was like,

426
00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:54.650
cause Gabriel Iglesias was with us and Angela,

427
00:23:54.651 --> 00:23:57.410
you know angel lists or Rukus Big Fat Greek guy.

428
00:23:57.620 --> 00:23:59.960
Maybe Andrew was with us and we were all at my brother.

429
00:23:59.961 --> 00:24:03.140
We were all just hanging out and the king was cooking and talking and making

430
00:24:03.141 --> 00:24:07.400
jokes.
He was considered dudes with machine guns all around a pile of cocaine.

431
00:24:07.670 --> 00:24:09.360
There was there

432
00:24:13.210 --> 00:24:16.430
was there like a disco downstairs and he hits a switch and all these girls,

433
00:24:16.431 --> 00:24:19.870
there was a shooting range in the basement.
Become really a shooting range.
Yeah.

434
00:24:21.540 --> 00:24:25.880
Not like a one lane.
It's like a big ass shooting.
Jesus Christ.

435
00:24:26.090 --> 00:24:28.260
Does he have any sort of crazy pimp set up?

436
00:24:28.261 --> 00:24:31.580
Any sort of like salt number NY type shit?
No,
no,
no.
He's cool.
He's,
he's,

437
00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:33.140
that's the thing.
He's very American,

438
00:24:33.141 --> 00:24:36.420
North American and western and the way he lives his life.

439
00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:39.770
I seen the guy that's into the gift,
uh,
he sent me,
he gave me a watch.

440
00:24:39.771 --> 00:24:41.420
I want to watch.
Watch is actually,

441
00:24:41.540 --> 00:24:43.700
I want to watch a documentary on the salt number nine.

442
00:24:43.730 --> 00:24:46.700
I want it to salt and Bernada open up his life for a reality show.

443
00:24:47.060 --> 00:24:50.510
So just say you want to see what's up,
what's up?
I'll show you what's up.

444
00:24:51.530 --> 00:24:53.480
He'll open dire straits can do that.
Yeah.

445
00:24:53.510 --> 00:24:58.510
Thousand Ferrari's and he's got gold underwear on and all these pictures come

446
00:24:58.761 --> 00:25:03.760
out naked and they adopt sneaky to
no,

447
00:25:03.980 --> 00:25:06.320
he didn't bat.
You know when he got caught with all this,

448
00:25:06.321 --> 00:25:09.360
when he was hiring all these American girls to go over there and far down with

449
00:25:09.361 --> 00:25:12.470
that dude,
you got to love the game,
man.
You gotta love with the guy.

450
00:25:12.471 --> 00:25:15.680
Did the guy would get magazines and we'd go get me her,
give me her.

451
00:25:15.681 --> 00:25:20.600
And he would get actresses and models.
He would get like porn stars.

452
00:25:20.601 --> 00:25:24.530
She would get girls from playboy and Penthouse and Maxim magazine.

453
00:25:24.531 --> 00:25:27.770
Like whoever the fuck you up and then one of them ratted out.

454
00:25:27.950 --> 00:25:31.100
One of them gave up the ghost and they found out what these girls were doing
for,

455
00:25:31.130 --> 00:25:35.690
you know,
$30 $30,000 a day over there spending crazy.

456
00:25:37.620 --> 00:25:40.190
I'd go straight for the porn star.
The one bothered within the act of,

457
00:25:40.270 --> 00:25:43.530
because I lift the porn stars and know what,
I'd rather turn out a regular chick,

458
00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:52.820
you're paying $30,000 right?
Going to go,
here's the thing,

459
00:25:52.821 --> 00:25:54.470
you don't need to pay a porn chick that much.

460
00:25:55.820 --> 00:25:57.860
They're only making a hundred a thousand bucks a scene.

461
00:25:58.090 --> 00:25:59.330
Fuck you overpaying them for it.

462
00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:02.200
You want to make sure you get return on your investment.

463
00:26:02.201 --> 00:26:06.320
It's like getting an open mic or making them headline.
Yeah,
exactly right.

464
00:26:07.010 --> 00:26:08.180
I think a,
yeah,

465
00:26:08.181 --> 00:26:11.540
this is a Charlie Sheen about that cause I was like how much are you paying

466
00:26:11.541 --> 00:26:14.210
these?
And it was because you'd read in the papers like 20 grand and I'm like,

467
00:26:14.211 --> 00:26:18.200
what the fuck?
He paid them 20 grand for,
these are Ibiza thousand dollars horse.

468
00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:23.400
He goes,
not now.
I would buy like credits
credit.

469
00:26:23.430 --> 00:26:24.200
He would be like,

470
00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:28.040
I give him 20 grand and I'd be like this is for 10 times or something.
Wow.

471
00:26:28.790 --> 00:26:33.500
Swipe his card has a little punch hard pimp game.

472
00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:36.410
There's a terrible pimp game cause you never pay up front for anything ever.

473
00:26:36.590 --> 00:26:39.060
Yeah,
I know these benefits can get run over or something.
Yeah.

474
00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:41.620
The only thing you should pay up front for his art.
Yeah.

475
00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:44.160
Have you guys been to exposed?
I in Canoga Park,

476
00:26:44.190 --> 00:26:46.680
<v 2>the Strip club that's out there.
They did this guy,</v>

477
00:26:46.710 --> 00:26:49.440
I've seen it but I've never been.
This guy is the smartest guy ever.

478
00:26:49.441 --> 00:26:53.730
He bought a shopping centers like Strip shopping center and it's like on the

479
00:26:53.731 --> 00:26:55.140
right side.
Do you have a weed store?

480
00:26:55.141 --> 00:26:59.230
It's open to teat 2:00 AM so I went there and bought a bunch of cookies and

481
00:26:59.460 --> 00:27:02.430
actually it's called 2:00 AM so don't tell him.
Then you go,

482
00:27:02.610 --> 00:27:04.270
there's a bar that's like a,

483
00:27:04.271 --> 00:27:06.840
they have every single bottle of liquor and drinks you could want.

484
00:27:06.841 --> 00:27:10.020
There's pool tables,
girls,
naked girls on the,
on the walls,

485
00:27:10.170 --> 00:27:15.090
and then they have a topless girls dancing in this bar and then you want to go

486
00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:16.740
deeper.
You go next door,

487
00:27:16.750 --> 00:27:20.490
then it's full nudity and it's all the like coke and water you can drink and

488
00:27:20.491 --> 00:27:21.150
stuff like that.

489
00:27:21.150 --> 00:27:24.270
It's like this big amusement park in the middle of nowhere where you just get

490
00:27:24.271 --> 00:27:27.180
weed and strippers.
It's awesome.
Wow.

491
00:27:28.250 --> 00:27:30.810
An amusement park.
Yeah,
it's like an amusement park.

492
00:27:30.870 --> 00:27:34.740
They have a strip club was,
it was a fun strip club.

493
00:27:34.741 --> 00:27:39.180
Well it was a Monday night,
so it wasn't like much going on,
but you know,

494
00:27:39.181 --> 00:27:42.680
I was just saying how awesome that is.
I guess on weekends it's Great.
You know,

495
00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:43.640
there's nothing weird.

496
00:27:43.641 --> 00:27:46.230
Or then when you go to the Strip club and no one's on the pole,

497
00:27:46.231 --> 00:27:50.100
dancing is only like two of the guys in the audience and you're waiting for the

498
00:27:50.101 --> 00:27:53.130
next dance would come out and try and get their shit together and you're like,

499
00:27:53.460 --> 00:27:55.130
no,
you really shouldn't be there.
Yeah.

500
00:27:55.140 --> 00:27:58.500
I remember I was in Adelaide a few years ago doing the comedy festival.

501
00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:03.480
Adelaide in Australia.
Oh,
okay.
And the one of the saddest size,

502
00:28:03.481 --> 00:28:04.850
they have a soul in between the Polo.

503
00:28:04.870 --> 00:28:09.210
Dalton says a guy comes out with a squeegee bottle and a cloth just to kind of

504
00:28:09.220 --> 00:28:10.053
reclean the pole.

505
00:28:12.750 --> 00:28:15.570
<v 0>I've seen that with Windex because they have to cause some of these dirty</v>

506
00:28:15.571 --> 00:28:17.580
bitches of the herps and the other other girls go,

507
00:28:17.581 --> 00:28:20.790
I don't want to be sliding down and get the herps off of this media,
whatever,

508
00:28:20.791 --> 00:28:22.040
everything.
You name it.
Right.

509
00:28:22.090 --> 00:28:24.670
<v 2>It's all on that little thing,
that swab.</v>

510
00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:28.390
You got to kind of kind of question your career choices if that's what you're

511
00:28:28.391 --> 00:28:32.830
doing.
A free,
yeah,
I guess.
Unless you have like $5,000 in your pocket.

512
00:28:33.370 --> 00:28:36.160
That's the big question is like what is more degrading?

513
00:28:36.161 --> 00:28:40.910
Is it more degrading to slide down a pole for $5,000 or to work at Denny's for a

514
00:28:40.911 --> 00:28:44.690
hundred yeah.
I mean there's,
I know a lot of these girls now,

515
00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:49.630
I know a lot of these girls I love to dance.
They love nudity,

516
00:28:49.631 --> 00:28:52.060
they love to dance and so to them they're like,
you know,

517
00:28:52.061 --> 00:28:54.130
I don't care about my body.
If you guys want to look at my body,

518
00:28:54.131 --> 00:28:57.200
that's fine and I'm making how much money.
Okay,
this is great.
I'm so,

519
00:28:57.480 --> 00:29:00.220
I like that the dom says,
I'm talking about the guy that comes.
Oh,

520
00:29:00.230 --> 00:29:04.240
the guy that comes to three he's clearly replaceable.
I was just,

521
00:29:04.930 --> 00:29:05.763
I was on editor.

522
00:29:05.870 --> 00:29:09.460
<v 0>He gets all uppity one day.
Yeah,
like what?
Man,
you you,</v>

523
00:29:09.461 --> 00:29:14.030
you find me a guy who could clean his polar.
I got to do
Roger.
You're crazy.

524
00:29:14.090 --> 00:29:17.540
You're not going to read them to you or Roger.
I'm just not using,
I have oil.

525
00:29:17.590 --> 00:29:20.210
I mean cleaning his Po for 18 years.
Man.
There's some secrets to the game.

526
00:29:20.770 --> 00:29:24.230
Why mother fuckers be twisting it and you got to go straight up and down.
Yo,

527
00:29:24.231 --> 00:29:25.610
y'all don't even appreciate y'all.

528
00:29:25.620 --> 00:29:28.250
I appreciate what kind of skill I'm bringing into this whole bond.

529
00:29:29.540 --> 00:29:30.730
You don't even know the right mixture.

530
00:29:30.740 --> 00:29:33.160
I ain't no a hundred percent Windex to see it and try it.

531
00:29:33.161 --> 00:29:35.000
Use it 100% Windex on that mother fucker.

532
00:29:35.001 --> 00:29:37.540
Watch what happens on my ass shaking tutor.

533
00:29:38.850 --> 00:29:41.890
You need to keep that porchlight Luma feed that you even know about.
All that

534
00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:46.870
<v 4>bitch bitch can pull the lip.
Meet curtains,</v>

535
00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:48.460
ducks.
I saw that last,

536
00:29:48.461 --> 00:29:50.650
like one of the girls was doing one of those things where you're sliding down a

537
00:29:50.651 --> 00:29:51.130
whole thing.

538
00:29:51.130 --> 00:29:56.130
You could just see her little pussy lip just retching and it must hurt hanging

539
00:29:56.930 --> 00:30:01.090
on the thing and it's numb like a Meu tie.
Fighters,
shins

540
00:30:03.550 --> 00:30:06.280
kicking banana trees and shit all her life.

541
00:30:06.730 --> 00:30:09.880
She can't feel nothing in that posting giraffes knee.

542
00:30:10.330 --> 00:30:12.520
That's the reason why she fucks.
She tries to stay alive.

543
00:30:12.690 --> 00:30:16.840
She just wants to feel something.
I just need to be loved internally.

544
00:30:16.930 --> 00:30:20.020
Did you ever wonder about a girl that you can't fuck hard enough?
Like God damn,

545
00:30:20.021 --> 00:30:22.990
bitch,
what are you trying to chase away?
This ain't normal.

546
00:30:23.020 --> 00:30:27.790
This isn't an exercise.
[inaudible] Whoa,
Whoa,
whoa,
Whoa,
whoa.
We got to talk.

547
00:30:27.791 --> 00:30:30.460
Can we cuddle for a Bullock?
What the fuck are we doing here?

548
00:30:31.270 --> 00:30:34.420
I came into your life without knowing the script like you're going to have to,

549
00:30:34.820 --> 00:30:38.020
you have to show me what the fuck happened in chapter one.
You know,

550
00:30:38.860 --> 00:30:41.560
where's your boners manual?
Real close to murder right here.

551
00:30:41.561 --> 00:30:46.120
What the fuck is going on?
Truly taking a run up,
choke you and fuck you to death.

552
00:30:46.121 --> 00:30:50.290
What's going on here?
I'm crazy.
Hooker.
What are you looking for from me?
Right.

553
00:30:50.590 --> 00:30:53.020
I'm with you twice as good to be married,
isn't it?
You know,

554
00:30:53.050 --> 00:30:53.880
you know what you're in for.

555
00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:57.840
<v 5>You want to hear depressing news that my dad gave me?
Yes or no?
Yes.</v>

556
00:30:57.841 --> 00:31:01.260
Super depressing.
Okay.
All right.
So I call him for father's Day and he goes,

557
00:31:01.261 --> 00:31:02.400
did you hear what happened to your niece?

558
00:31:02.430 --> 00:31:06.060
And my niece is like 21 and she's a lesbian and stuff like that.

559
00:31:06.090 --> 00:31:09.900
And we've talked about before.
And uh,
she,
she,

560
00:31:09.930 --> 00:31:12.750
her and her girlfriend lived together and worked at this place called Tim

561
00:31:12.750 --> 00:31:16.020
Horton's,
which is like this.
Yeah.
It's like your family's Canadian.
No,

562
00:31:16.021 --> 00:31:20.040
they haven't been,
uh,
Columbus,
Ohio also for some reason,
but it's,
yeah,

563
00:31:20.041 --> 00:31:22.620
it's a coffee place,
but it's like a fast food coffee place,
you know,

564
00:31:22.621 --> 00:31:24.060
it's like whatever minimum wage.

565
00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:26.340
So that place closed down or something like that.

566
00:31:26.341 --> 00:31:30.510
So they had to relocate to another one and they,
the,
the,
my niece,

567
00:31:30.511 --> 00:31:34.170
his girlfriend was making all the money for the family because she got laid off,

568
00:31:34.171 --> 00:31:38.160
my niece got laid off and so she had to take this bus to go to Tim Horton's.

569
00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:41.130
They closed that Tim Horton's and now she has to ride her bike to this farther

570
00:31:41.131 --> 00:31:41.371
away.

571
00:31:41.371 --> 00:31:44.340
Tim Horton's and she's been working at night shifts as you and riding her bike

572
00:31:44.341 --> 00:31:45.151
back and forth.
You know,

573
00:31:45.151 --> 00:31:48.630
I like super late at night and they were so poor that they didn't have a light.

574
00:31:48.631 --> 00:31:50.970
So they taped that flashlight on door bike.

575
00:31:51.090 --> 00:31:53.250
So when she was driving at night and so on,

576
00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:56.030
so she's driving home the other day at 1138 or,

577
00:31:56.040 --> 00:32:00.210
I mean riding her bike and this guy hits her from behind going like 45 miles an

578
00:32:00.211 --> 00:32:03.180
hour.
She flies off and goes crazy down the street.

579
00:32:03.330 --> 00:32:06.300
He gets out of the cars calling nine one and she's like,
am I going to die?

580
00:32:06.310 --> 00:32:08.580
And saw this other car fucking runs over her.

581
00:32:08.581 --> 00:32:12.150
And then the second car runs over and drags her body down like a mile down the

582
00:32:12.151 --> 00:32:15.450
street and that car takes off.
But anyways,

583
00:32:15.451 --> 00:32:19.770
it's like now and then,
so then she goes,
and then my dad goes,

584
00:32:19.771 --> 00:32:21.090
you wanna hear what happened?
Your nephew?
Well,

585
00:32:21.091 --> 00:32:23.030
because of the Japanese earthquake,
uh,

586
00:32:23.070 --> 00:32:25.680
he worked at the Honda plant doing really well.
They don't have parts anymore,

587
00:32:25.681 --> 00:32:29.640
so they had to lay off everybody at the Honda plant and that he was on at.

588
00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:33.520
So he gets laid off.
And so both my niece and my nephew,
my nieces now suicide,

589
00:32:33.521 --> 00:32:37.230
and my nephew is now both going back to my stepbrothers house to live and it's

590
00:32:37.231 --> 00:32:41.480
just like the same week.
And I was like,
well,
what's,
where did she live?
Huh?
No,

591
00:32:41.570 --> 00:32:44.810
she died.
Oh,
and they're looking for the guy.
So in Columbus,
Ohio,

592
00:32:47.170 --> 00:32:48.003
and then we'll be right.

593
00:32:48.460 --> 00:32:52.660
<v 0>[inaudible] brought to you by the fleshlight.</v>

594
00:32:52.670 --> 00:32:55.880
I know that you said you want to hear some depressing news,

595
00:32:56.110 --> 00:32:58.990
but somehow or another,
I thought there was a point to it.

596
00:33:01.620 --> 00:33:04.190
Someone got run over by a fucking car five times.

597
00:33:05.780 --> 00:33:09.650
If you see a car with some lesbian [inaudible],
please call the Columbus blue

598
00:33:11.430 --> 00:33:13.790
trail on the front.
It times are tough for everywhere,

599
00:33:13.850 --> 00:33:16.220
especially if you're in a bad spot.
That's the number one thing.

600
00:33:16.221 --> 00:33:19.550
If you're in a spot like Columbus or high or spot,
it doesn't have a lot of jobs.

601
00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:20.820
You need to get the fuck out of [inaudible]

602
00:33:22.340 --> 00:33:26.460
<v 5>from Columbus,
Ohio was buster Douglas and Brian Redman.
Wendy's.
Oh yeah.
Right.</v>

603
00:33:27.420 --> 00:33:29.700
And that's another thing.
This is Tim Horton's.
You're making $5 an hour.

604
00:33:29.701 --> 00:33:32.730
If you're riding your bike five miles to go to Tim Horton's,

605
00:33:32.731 --> 00:33:34.320
find another job by your house that you make.

606
00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:37.370
<v 0>Same amount of money.
There's just no jobs.
Yeah,
you're saying that,</v>

607
00:33:37.371 --> 00:33:40.860
but you don't understand how bad it is out there in some spots and sun spots of

608
00:33:40.861 --> 00:33:42.020
the are no options,
man.

609
00:33:42.021 --> 00:33:44.660
There's people with PhDs that are taking job waiting tables.

610
00:33:46.130 --> 00:33:48.770
<v 5>I was telling my mom that she goes,
oh,
we're better than Detroit.</v>

611
00:33:50.500 --> 00:33:55.260
<v 0>Yeah,
that's Troy.
It is so bad.
It's almost the Caveman Times Detroit.</v>

612
00:33:56.280 --> 00:34:00.910
They just,
they just released the Detroit has 47% illiteracy.

613
00:34:01.490 --> 00:34:04.930
Literacy.
Illiteracy retweeted that when you're,

614
00:34:05.470 --> 00:34:06.910
I can't believe that.

615
00:34:07.290 --> 00:34:10.670
And you said it doesn't matter cause they'll never read this.

616
00:34:11.570 --> 00:34:14.500
Don't your Twitter or something like that.
I retweeted.
It was hilarious.

617
00:34:14.580 --> 00:34:17.470
You know that's a crazy thing,
man.
Wow.
That's a crazy thing.

618
00:34:17.890 --> 00:34:19.240
That's a really scary thing.

619
00:34:19.390 --> 00:34:23.290
Those people are only as smart as the people they know.
They can't read anything.

620
00:34:23.291 --> 00:34:25.480
They can't go on Google.
They could watch documentaries.

621
00:34:25.481 --> 00:34:28.270
Maybe they can learn something from that,
but other than that,
they can't read.

622
00:34:28.650 --> 00:34:30.790
If you can't read,
you can't learn anything.
If you can't learn anything,

623
00:34:30.791 --> 00:34:33.430
you can't check facts.
You check facts.
You're fucked.

624
00:34:33.431 --> 00:34:35.980
You only as smart as the people hang a right.
Does that happen?

625
00:34:36.430 --> 00:34:39.400
You know why people are shit parents,
man.
That's how it happens there.

626
00:34:39.401 --> 00:34:42.850
Their children having children,
that's what it is.
There's a mother of five,

627
00:34:42.851 --> 00:34:47.100
by the way.
Awesome.
Let's stop.
Stop,

628
00:34:48.680 --> 00:34:52.630
stop.
Stop.
She was a lesbian,
so she had boys in all of her her whole life.

629
00:34:52.900 --> 00:34:54.810
She gave up on Dick after a while.
I was drowning.

630
00:34:54.830 --> 00:34:59.770
Questions not as dangerous as bike riding.
Apparently too soon.

631
00:35:00.340 --> 00:35:05.140
Very soon.
Very soon.
Yeah.
Let's let that sit there for a second.

632
00:35:06.420 --> 00:35:09.100
It's sucks.
Yeah.
If you're in a bad spot,
man,
you've got to move.

633
00:35:09.570 --> 00:35:12.440
Can't be riding your bike to Tim Horton's and five in the morning,
but you're,

634
00:35:12.460 --> 00:35:15.790
you're wrong man.
When you say like surely should be able to get another job.
No,

635
00:35:15.791 --> 00:35:19.960
I mean it minimum wage job.
I mean it can't get jobs,

636
00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:23.310
but there's only so many minimum wage jobs go away.

637
00:35:24.460 --> 00:35:26.470
I don't think Kim Tim Horton's is minimum wage.

638
00:35:26.471 --> 00:35:27.940
I'm sure they pay a little bit better than that.

639
00:35:28.630 --> 00:35:31.810
It's like a Dunkin donuts bagels and stuff.

640
00:35:32.060 --> 00:35:35.860
You don't think Dunkin donuts would pay over minimum wage and I was a Canadian

641
00:35:35.861 --> 00:35:37.920
company.
It's probably not gonna pay that one.
Mcdonald's barely

642
00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:41.490
<v 4>minimum wage.
And that's a little bit of socialism going on in Canada,</v>

643
00:35:41.491 --> 00:35:46.400
but not full bloom.
No.
Were you shocked at the riots?
I was.

644
00:35:46.470 --> 00:35:49.750
For the people that don't know there was giant riots in Vancouver when it looks

645
00:35:49.770 --> 00:35:51.470
lost game seven.
Yeah.
Yeah.

646
00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:55.920
They lost the hockey and the Stanley Cup and hockey means a lot to Canada.
It's,

647
00:35:55.921 --> 00:35:59.280
it's,
it's there,
it's there,
everything.
But I mean,

648
00:35:59.310 --> 00:36:01.740
what the fuck are you riding for dude?
Yeah.
What are you doing?

649
00:36:01.741 --> 00:36:05.980
Are you taking out on right at the,
at the players when they show it,

650
00:36:06.950 --> 00:36:09.510
they show up.
Are they going to do man in lost a fucking gay?
I mean it's,

651
00:36:09.511 --> 00:36:12.840
it's just a game.
Why is everybody gone so crazy and what are they mad at?

652
00:36:12.850 --> 00:36:16.380
All the fucking players in Boston or fucking Canadian anyway.
Yeah,
it's true.

653
00:36:16.381 --> 00:36:20.490
Right?
You know,
we didn't really lose,
I was there want to riot.

654
00:36:20.550 --> 00:36:25.550
I was there for game five and that was in vim carton or was in Vancouver for

655
00:36:26.430 --> 00:36:28.820
game five and I didn't watch the game,
but I was,

656
00:36:28.821 --> 00:36:32.610
I was working on my material before my set and I was hearing people scream out

657
00:36:32.611 --> 00:36:35.040
the window like for hours and hours,

658
00:36:35.041 --> 00:36:38.850
people were screaming in the streets like happiest,
fuck,
cheering and screaming.

659
00:36:38.851 --> 00:36:40.770
Like they couldn't be happier everywhere you went.

660
00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:42.360
Everybody had a big smile on their face.

661
00:36:42.510 --> 00:36:47.130
So for me to come back home to La and then to hear that it was it on Tuesday,

662
00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:50.490
whatever it was,
whatever day it was,
the head of the riots,
I was like,
Whoa,

663
00:36:50.491 --> 00:36:54.030
I was just there five days ago.
They were all so happy,
you know?

664
00:36:54.031 --> 00:36:55.740
But I'll be honest with you,
I think if they had one,

665
00:36:55.741 --> 00:36:58.210
they would have still been riots.
Really?
It didn't really make it happen.

666
00:36:58.240 --> 00:37:01.680
That's how it was for the buckeyes.
And the same thing with the Lakers when they,

667
00:37:01.681 --> 00:37:06.250
when fucking people riot.
What is it with sports teams drawn?

668
00:37:06.300 --> 00:37:08.460
Retires,
right.
I don't like team sports either,

669
00:37:08.461 --> 00:37:11.640
so I didn't really make a difference to me.
Yeah,
you're always going to the UFC.

670
00:37:11.641 --> 00:37:12.930
You don't,
you don't watch other sports.

671
00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:16.800
MMA and boxing really boxing as long as number one to me.
And then I really,

672
00:37:17.020 --> 00:37:20.690
are you looking forward to a battalion or a bladder?
Be Klitschko DNA.

673
00:37:21.150 --> 00:37:24.740
That's going to be good.
I'm glad to hear Vitaly Vitaly,
you know Vladimir Vitale.

674
00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:27.810
[inaudible] I want to fight,
but tell me is fighting,
uh,

675
00:37:28.020 --> 00:37:31.440
how do you say his name to Matt said Thomas Adamak add a Mac.
Yeah,

676
00:37:31.441 --> 00:37:33.390
he's gonna beat the shit out of Adam was a cruiserweight.

677
00:37:33.391 --> 00:37:37.110
He's gonna knock the shit out of a bigger cruiser weight.
Yeah.

678
00:37:37.111 --> 00:37:40.080
David had gotten bad a punch on him.
How tall is the guy that David fighting?

679
00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:42.030
[inaudible] know him.
He's huge.

680
00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:48.080
He's six foot seven Ukrainian ridiculous athletes.
Yeah,
he's in Ray.

681
00:37:48.110 --> 00:37:51.540
He is fucking ridiculous.
And he's really smart.

682
00:37:51.630 --> 00:37:54.300
And they both have their doctorates or something.
Yeah,
they were.

683
00:37:54.301 --> 00:37:55.350
Then they want to be politicians.

684
00:37:55.351 --> 00:37:57.960
It's crazy how one of them can take a fucking hell of a punch.

685
00:37:57.961 --> 00:38:01.020
And the other one just can't know.
The other one folds is the one with waiting.

686
00:38:01.110 --> 00:38:04.420
It's hurt.
Yeah,
but fatality.
You can hit that dude with a fucking missile.
Yeah.

687
00:38:04.730 --> 00:38:06.360
And it just,
he just laughs it off.

688
00:38:06.750 --> 00:38:10.570
It's going to be a good scrap for about three rounds.
You think so?
Yeah.

689
00:38:10.620 --> 00:38:14.570
I think David Hayes really overstepping his mark.
Do you really look at,

690
00:38:14.610 --> 00:38:19.440
she's too small for him?
I think so.
What was the break punch.
But they need to,

691
00:38:19.740 --> 00:38:20.340
they need this,

692
00:38:20.340 --> 00:38:22.980
they need to create a super heavyweight division now because it's,
it's,

693
00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:28.110
it's missed.
Its disproportionate.
How much is a um,
Vitaly way,
Vladimir way?

694
00:38:28.260 --> 00:38:32.670
Uh,
they,
they weigh around two 42 volt of them two 42 feet close on name.

695
00:38:33.090 --> 00:38:36.130
Yeah,
but they're lean.
Right.
And David Hayes,
what he's,

696
00:38:36.131 --> 00:38:38.470
who tend to come in here maybe to 20th if he's,

697
00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:42.560
if that's heavy for him really could come in and around to 14 but do you know

698
00:38:42.561 --> 00:38:46.150
that in some sports they think that guys who are smaller have a big advantage

699
00:38:46.151 --> 00:38:49.660
because they don't have to pump blood through all that muscle?
It's true.

700
00:38:49.661 --> 00:38:53.340
But I'm a good big man.
When I was being a little,
I don't know,

701
00:38:53.341 --> 00:38:56.080
because they want to reach,
I mean I didn't know much about boxing,
but the,

702
00:38:56.081 --> 00:38:58.800
the reach obviously on the,
on the big guy compared to Haines,

703
00:38:58.830 --> 00:39:01.870
it's going to be ridiculous.
Well,
you know,
I agree.
But you know some,

704
00:39:01.900 --> 00:39:04.590
some people like,
like Cain Velasquez,
so perfect example,

705
00:39:04.610 --> 00:39:08.250
UFC heavyweight champion.
He's not big.
He's about to 40.
But,

706
00:39:08.270 --> 00:39:10.990
but Cain puts a pace on guys.
If they can't keep up with,

707
00:39:11.010 --> 00:39:14.100
it's like you makes you run with them and then he drowns you.
But canes,

708
00:39:14.101 --> 00:39:18.070
he's solid.
He's a solid diesel,
but he's nothing compared to Brock Lesnar.

709
00:39:18.100 --> 00:39:22.810
Brock Lesnar might have been 45 pounds of muscle heavier than him.
That's huge.

710
00:39:23.110 --> 00:39:23.711
Meanwhile,

711
00:39:23.711 --> 00:39:27.340
cane beat the shit out of Brock Lesnar inside of one round shit out of it.
Yeah.

712
00:39:27.341 --> 00:39:29.260
He beat the shit out of him,
you know.
I mean he's,

713
00:39:29.261 --> 00:39:32.440
he's got a pace that he can keep up.
So you gotta think with David,
Hey,

714
00:39:32.441 --> 00:39:36.810
maybe David.
Hey can put a pace that Vladimir can cause uh,

715
00:39:37.220 --> 00:39:39.970
Vladimir is proportionately large,
right?

716
00:39:40.350 --> 00:39:43.690
A Brock is disproportionately large.
Right.

717
00:39:43.691 --> 00:39:45.970
I use a lot whiter than he needs to be,

718
00:39:46.120 --> 00:39:49.990
but it looked like Manny Pacquiao and I'm Margarito that's a perfect example.

719
00:39:50.020 --> 00:39:52.930
That's a good example.
The guy who is just,
he's faster.

720
00:39:53.220 --> 00:39:57.840
He also has the intestinal fortitude to go forward like that.
Yeah.
I think,
hey,

721
00:39:57.890 --> 00:40:02.110
uh,
hey has been rocked in the past.
Yeah.
And that's by lighter guy.
So,

722
00:40:02.300 --> 00:40:04.690
but you don't think after all this shit talking and he's just going to jump

723
00:40:04.691 --> 00:40:07.780
right in.
I saw,
I will say the more somebody talk shit to more trouble therein.

724
00:40:07.850 --> 00:40:08.770
You think so?
Yeah.

725
00:40:09.220 --> 00:40:09.660
<v 6>Okay.</v>

726
00:40:09.660 --> 00:40:12.780
<v 4>A lot of guys do that.
Then when you're scared they talk shit.
Of course.</v>

727
00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:15.810
Of course.
I think that's what it is.
He's trying to get inside Vladimir said,

728
00:40:15.811 --> 00:40:18.750
but vitamin those guys grew up in a fucking war torn country.

729
00:40:18.751 --> 00:40:20.130
You think you're going to intimidate them?

730
00:40:20.340 --> 00:40:23.400
It's funny watching them talk shit though.
My friends see them.

731
00:40:23.460 --> 00:40:26.610
Did you see the video?
Cause one's got a British accent,

732
00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:28.470
the other one's got a Ukrainian acts.
I don't want to get to the,

733
00:40:28.490 --> 00:40:31.130
I want to hear some good old fashioned American accent shit.

734
00:40:31.140 --> 00:40:35.260
Talking Floyd Mayweather styles should I saw,
um,

735
00:40:35.790 --> 00:40:39.840
I saw one of my friends fight flat mirror and knocked him down three times.

736
00:40:39.870 --> 00:40:44.430
Who's that?
Viral Williamson and they ripped off the Verilyn the decision.
But uh,

737
00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:46.950
he wants a rematch with him so bad.
But you know,

738
00:40:46.951 --> 00:40:49.680
if like it's never going to happen and it's just a Vladimir you think just can't

739
00:40:49.681 --> 00:40:53.260
take a punch that well.
Yeah.
And,
and Darryl was like an awkward fighter.

740
00:40:53.820 --> 00:40:58.200
Fucking hey,
you shut the way to go Joe.

741
00:41:00.330 --> 00:41:01.163
<v 7>Okay.</v>

742
00:41:02.790 --> 00:41:03.623
<v 4>It's right here.</v>

743
00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:13.210
Hello.
Hey Man,
dude,
your podcast.

744
00:41:14.540 --> 00:41:19.110
Can you give a shout out?
It's my cousin's birthday coming up.
Okay,
thank you.
Hi,

745
00:41:19.111 --> 00:41:23.010
this is Tony from the shake weight.
I hope I don't get any more phone calls.

746
00:41:24.030 --> 00:41:26.300
I had to answer that my,
my gait was getting fixed.

747
00:41:27.560 --> 00:41:29.940
I got to keep the coyotes out.
Right.

748
00:41:29.970 --> 00:41:33.310
You know the Mexicans at smuggled people into the country.
Yes.
You

749
00:41:34.670 --> 00:41:39.140
<v 0>know,
that's the people that they smuggled drugs,
coyotes or their mules,
mules,</v>

750
00:41:41.450 --> 00:41:45.410
mules,
bringing drugs in there.
But right now it works and they're beautiful.

751
00:41:45.411 --> 00:41:50.390
We know on that.
I'm learning so much here.
Do you do gigs in Mexico over?

752
00:41:50.540 --> 00:41:52.790
Nah,
they don't.
They don't speak enough English really.

753
00:41:52.910 --> 00:41:55.580
And I don't speak enough Spanish.
There's no,
uh,
this,

754
00:41:55.620 --> 00:41:59.660
I've never heard of anybody doing standup comedy in Mexico.
I think Lopez has.
Oh,

755
00:41:59.661 --> 00:42:03.320
I bet.
Right?
Does he ever do is act and full Spanish?
I don't know.

756
00:42:03.960 --> 00:42:07.820
I'm sure he probably could he speak Spanish show Diaz will fuck up a Spanish

757
00:42:07.821 --> 00:42:09.740
crowd and he's done.
I've in Miami,

758
00:42:09.741 --> 00:42:12.260
I've seen Joey Diaz do like five minute chunks.

759
00:42:12.261 --> 00:42:15.380
Just straight in Spanish and a regular show.
The Spanish.
Oh yeah.

760
00:42:15.381 --> 00:42:18.590
Joey's awaken are cute.
Cuban.
Oh Yeah,
mine.
That's in Miami.

761
00:42:18.591 --> 00:42:21.170
He's got that Cuban flair as they go crazy for it.
No,

762
00:42:21.171 --> 00:42:25.400
they never laugh at anybody harder than Joey Diaz in Miami.
This is true.

763
00:42:25.460 --> 00:42:26.900
There's something that happens.

764
00:42:27.020 --> 00:42:30.200
There's a chemical reaction with that crowd because he looks like a big Guinea

765
00:42:30.201 --> 00:42:34.700
too.
A little bit.
Yeah.
We,
it looks like a big Cuban too.
Can we say the g word?

766
00:42:34.701 --> 00:42:38.720
Do that.
Okay.
What does that God,
no leap Guinea.
Guinea.
Yeah.
We can say that way.

767
00:42:39.470 --> 00:42:42.470
I'm just checking.
Yeah,
times have no problem with that.

768
00:42:42.650 --> 00:42:45.770
They call each other guineas,
but you can call them my Guinea to,
they don't care.

769
00:42:45.860 --> 00:42:48.070
Yeah.
I don't even get that.
I don't even know.

770
00:42:48.430 --> 00:42:49.940
I don't get the reference Guinea pigs.

771
00:42:50.660 --> 00:42:55.490
Isn't that my grandfather said they used to call him a Guinea wop that does what

772
00:42:55.491 --> 00:42:59.270
they call them grandfather.
Italian.
Oh yeah,
yeah.
I'm mostly Italian.

773
00:42:59.720 --> 00:43:02.300
One quarter Irish,
three quarters Italian.
That's what the Rogan comes from.

774
00:43:02.540 --> 00:43:05.660
Everybody else's right off the boat.
Well,
they're all immigrants.

775
00:43:05.690 --> 00:43:09.290
My grandfather came from Ireland on my father's side and everybody else came

776
00:43:09.291 --> 00:43:11.090
from Italy.
My grandmother came from Italy.

777
00:43:11.300 --> 00:43:15.860
My grandmother and my mother saw no scramble grandmama whose grandma was crazy

778
00:43:15.861 --> 00:43:18.920
bitch.
Crazy as fuck man.
That was,

779
00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:24.230
she scared me away from relationships for most of my life cause I would be when

780
00:43:24.231 --> 00:43:24.741
I was a little kid,

781
00:43:24.741 --> 00:43:27.350
my parents got divorced and we stayed with my grandmother and my grandfather for

782
00:43:27.351 --> 00:43:29.840
a little bit,
for like a year.
And when we were staying with them,

783
00:43:29.870 --> 00:43:34.730
my grandmother used to fucking scream at my grandfather.
She would just,
just,

784
00:43:34.731 --> 00:43:35.564
just crimped,

785
00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:42.380
she would go crazy and yell at him and say,
she's going to leave.

786
00:43:42.381 --> 00:43:44.840
I'm going to move in with my sister and,
and I'd be like,

787
00:43:44.870 --> 00:43:47.960
Jesus fucking Christ is this what happens when you live together?

788
00:43:48.970 --> 00:43:53.270
And this was some shit like this was what was registered in my mind.

789
00:43:53.271 --> 00:43:54.830
This was a relationship when I was five,

790
00:43:54.831 --> 00:43:58.370
I had my mother and father who just broke up cause my father used to hit my

791
00:43:58.371 --> 00:44:01.820
mother and then I'm in with my grandmother and my grandfather and my

792
00:44:01.821 --> 00:44:05.450
grandmother's screams and my grandfather,
my grandfather just wilts.

793
00:44:05.690 --> 00:44:08.900
He just takes it and eats it and every now and then he said something back to

794
00:44:08.901 --> 00:44:12.800
please just stop it.
Please just stop it.
Throw one of those in there.

795
00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:17.570
For the most part he did.
How'd you exercise that out of your mind?
Well,
no,

796
00:44:17.571 --> 00:44:21.150
I think,
I think it's the perfect balance is when you grow up in DC,

797
00:44:21.220 --> 00:44:24.320
shitty relationships,
then you all,
you think about it,
and I don't want that.

798
00:44:25.100 --> 00:44:27.290
My problem is I grew up with my parents.

799
00:44:27.291 --> 00:44:31.920
My parents were together for 40 years and my dad died.
My mom loves my dad.

800
00:44:31.921 --> 00:44:34.650
You know what I mean?
So all I know is that relationship and I'm like,

801
00:44:34.920 --> 00:44:39.870
I'm never going to fucking handle that.
That's not possible.
But it is possible.

802
00:44:39.871 --> 00:44:42.480
It's certainly possible.
You got to put that energy out there though,

803
00:44:42.481 --> 00:44:45.750
and you've gotta be,
you gotta reject anybody that doesn't go along those lines.

804
00:44:45.751 --> 00:44:49.110
People get developed patterns and relationships and they want to,

805
00:44:49.170 --> 00:44:52.530
they want to continue those patterns with you.
And some of them like to fight.

806
00:44:52.531 --> 00:44:54.000
Some people just like to fucking fight.

807
00:44:54.020 --> 00:44:56.640
Do you want to see how that's not me at all?
Not me at all.
I don't like it.

808
00:44:56.641 --> 00:44:59.460
I would assume that that's me.
I don't,
I don't like any of that shit.

809
00:44:59.461 --> 00:45:01.440
I don't like it when my friends,
I don't like it with girls.

810
00:45:01.830 --> 00:45:04.490
Like I was just talking to someone the other day,
uh,

811
00:45:04.491 --> 00:45:08.670
a buddy and his wife and his,
his wife says something crazy.

812
00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:13.170
She goes,
so does your wife let you just do whatever you want to do?

813
00:45:13.171 --> 00:45:16.700
Does she let you,
you know,
go do shows and play pool?
And I'm like,
this is,

814
00:45:16.701 --> 00:45:21.240
my wife lent me.
I'm like,
what kind of alien talk is this?
Let me,

815
00:45:21.241 --> 00:45:25.320
my keeper does my keeper,
let me free is my keeper.
Let me work.

816
00:45:25.590 --> 00:45:27.900
I kinda thought about it and I was like,
what does that was a friend.

817
00:45:28.080 --> 00:45:30.570
What if it was like this?
Brian,
let you go do shows.

818
00:45:30.630 --> 00:45:33.410
There's Brian let you go to dinner whenever you want.
Like what did you do?

819
00:45:33.411 --> 00:45:36.630
You not like me.
Why do you want to tell me?
What the fuck I can't do that?

820
00:45:36.631 --> 00:45:41.160
I want to do like what kind of a weird distinction is that?

821
00:45:41.161 --> 00:45:43.230
But in her eyes,
that's the commonplace.

822
00:45:43.231 --> 00:45:46.860
The commonplace is that the woman gets to dictate to the man what the man does.

823
00:45:46.970 --> 00:45:49.530
Oh yeah.
Does your wife let you drive that car?

824
00:45:51.270 --> 00:45:54.930
<v 4>Oh,
Joe,
does your wife let you not for the podcast.
Have you ever had,</v>

825
00:45:56.040 --> 00:45:58.470
have you ever had a chick tried to tell you not to buy a certain car?

826
00:45:58.500 --> 00:46:03.480
Did you imagine that?
Um,
I just bought a fucking crazy car and which this guy,

827
00:46:04.170 --> 00:46:06.660
I bought a rolls Royce Phantom Drophead converted.

828
00:46:10.170 --> 00:46:14.760
I love it here in La.
Yeah,
but I'm getting the Stereo read in it.

829
00:46:14.910 --> 00:46:18.510
Oh,
you're an animal.
You're a fucking savage.
She'd do it.
The old stereo,

830
00:46:18.600 --> 00:46:22.410
it sucked.
It was honestly the worst thorough.
Even,
even the Guy Rolls Royce goes.

831
00:46:22.411 --> 00:46:25.290
Yeah,
it's a common complaints.
Pretty shitty system.
I know they don't have to.

832
00:46:25.620 --> 00:46:28.360
It's a Rolls Royce.
A classical music.
What do they need?

833
00:46:28.720 --> 00:46:30.630
It's really weak by them though.

834
00:46:30.631 --> 00:46:33.150
They should provide the full ride with everything.

835
00:46:33.151 --> 00:46:36.600
Bad Ass considering it's the Rolls Royce of fucking Rolls Royces.
Yeah.

836
00:46:36.601 --> 00:46:38.700
I had a Porsche once and had a terrible stereo.

837
00:46:38.701 --> 00:46:42.330
It was like the most wonky is shitty.
Shittiest tinniest stereo.

838
00:46:45.590 --> 00:46:47.760
The stereo they put in a new one is fucking it.

839
00:46:48.170 --> 00:46:51.770
<v 2>I just heard this new stereo that you can get where it mimics your iPhone so</v>

840
00:46:51.771 --> 00:46:54.770
that it's just a broadcast and it's touchscreen,

841
00:46:54.890 --> 00:46:57.860
so you just go there like open up iTunes,
go to,
you know,

842
00:46:58.230 --> 00:47:02.660
shows up on your navigation.
It's like an Ipad,
but it mimics your iPhone.

843
00:47:02.661 --> 00:47:06.760
That's a good pocket to do.
Lost driving.
Yeah,
right.
Exactly.

844
00:47:06.770 --> 00:47:09.560
Let me just Google my friend.
Yeah,
exactly.

845
00:47:09.590 --> 00:47:11.750
Like we need one more fucking a Google traffic.

846
00:47:11.780 --> 00:47:14.170
How many times do you see someone who even in and you see this

847
00:47:14.220 --> 00:47:16.470
<v 0>motherfucker looking down at his phone,
looking at the road,</v>

848
00:47:16.471 --> 00:47:17.940
look at down his phone,
looking at the road,

849
00:47:18.210 --> 00:47:21.240
like you ate a piece of shit and they've said the people that are,

850
00:47:21.270 --> 00:47:23.010
that you're texting and driving,

851
00:47:23.011 --> 00:47:26.790
it's like equivalent to being like five times over the legal limit of alcohol as

852
00:47:26.791 --> 00:47:29.860
far as the likelihood of crashes.
Yeah,
it does seem about right.

853
00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:31.090
<v 2>Yeah.
That the,
you know,</v>

854
00:47:31.091 --> 00:47:35.410
Ford has that new technology in the fucking focus where it reads your text

855
00:47:35.411 --> 00:47:38.500
messages to you when they come.
That's good.

856
00:47:39.720 --> 00:47:43.810
Kind of sucks is I have a Ford in.
The problem I have is that they stop it.

857
00:47:43.830 --> 00:47:46.030
You can't update it.
So in like a year you're,

858
00:47:46.060 --> 00:47:49.720
you're shit's not working with all the newest stuff cause they don't update the

859
00:47:49.721 --> 00:47:53.680
software.
The fact that you don't want your fucking text messages,

860
00:47:54.360 --> 00:47:57.880
other people are in the car with you.
I saw your cock.
It is so big.

861
00:47:57.881 --> 00:48:01.540
I wanted in my man.
When are you coming home?
Does your wife know yet?

862
00:48:01.590 --> 00:48:04.600
I love frank

863
00:48:07.710 --> 00:48:09.310
and then I look at her.
Oh Frank,

864
00:48:10.210 --> 00:48:14.350
I love the droid feature where you can talk to her text messages.
You can uh,

865
00:48:14.450 --> 00:48:17.770
it as a text.
That's really good.
I gotta pee.
Excuse me.

866
00:48:19.060 --> 00:48:23.450
That's my new iPhone operating system.
Oh,
but finally these fucks,
by the way,

867
00:48:23.451 --> 00:48:26.560
have you ever seen Greece?
I'm sure you have,
right?
He's the musical.
Yeah.

868
00:48:26.620 --> 00:48:30.760
I've never seen grease John Travolta.
Yeah.
I recently just watched it and I,

869
00:48:30.761 --> 00:48:34.990
this is my question,
was it always supposed to be just kind of like a everyone,

870
00:48:35.350 --> 00:48:38.620
did people believe that those people were high school kids?
No.
No.

871
00:48:38.621 --> 00:48:40.720
I know what you're saying.
Everybody looked like they were 30 years old.

872
00:48:41.010 --> 00:48:45.730
Like look at this guy right here.
Like this guy looks like,
like he's 45.

873
00:48:45.731 --> 00:48:48.850
He's got like a beard coming in.
Like my biggest problem,

874
00:48:48.851 --> 00:48:52.040
I have the problem that grief came out in [inaudible] 78.
Yeah,

875
00:48:52.420 --> 00:48:55.480
I'm about to be published for the last 2023 years.

876
00:48:57.510 --> 00:48:59.060
Long time.

877
00:49:01.640 --> 00:49:06.640
I've had a problem with this field because at the end of the movie she takes up

878
00:49:07.031 --> 00:49:10.950
smoking and she's someone who's tight,
tight path with,
you know,

879
00:49:11.020 --> 00:49:12.940
which means you're going to get thrush or something.

880
00:49:13.650 --> 00:49:18.650
She's going to get what you get thrush fucked in her cunt because I want to mean

881
00:49:19.810 --> 00:49:24.580
look a little like a luck of clotted cream effect in a pussy.
Oh,
thrush.

882
00:49:24.640 --> 00:49:29.320
That's what it's called.
I never knew what to call it.
I've seen that before.

883
00:49:30.850 --> 00:49:35.510
Not pasty.
Um,
cottage cheese.
So we don't,
she does all of this to,

884
00:49:35.511 --> 00:49:39.560
to translate to become more like him.
He puts on a fucking Cardigan.
Yeah.

885
00:49:40.010 --> 00:49:43.580
That's not really like a balance thing for the day.
Right.

886
00:49:43.960 --> 00:49:48.500
She had gone all the way.
She went for horse,
slotted to stuff up to the Max.

887
00:49:48.501 --> 00:49:50.620
So I and equals in a fucking car to good medic life.

888
00:49:50.680 --> 00:49:54.700
Maybe he was like a future hipster.
He just had it,
had it nailed really early on.

889
00:49:54.820 --> 00:49:59.260
Right.
That's like hipster,
hipster clothing.
It was kind of again,
and we're back.

890
00:49:59.290 --> 00:50:01.780
We were talking about,
um,
your back.
We're here.
Stocker.

891
00:50:01.790 --> 00:50:04.030
Channing was fucking 80 when she did that movie

892
00:50:05.930 --> 00:50:10.210
cut back then.
Remember?
Yeah,
it's true.
But it was weird.

893
00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:13.240
He's got a picture of one guy in the hallway who looks like he's 40 years old.

894
00:50:13.750 --> 00:50:16.960
Let me see.
Can I come around there?
Yeah.
Yeah.

895
00:50:19.150 --> 00:50:21.660
And then everybody else,
I mean,
this is just one of the guys.

896
00:50:21.661 --> 00:50:26.590
I like the five guys,
but I mean he has like,
here's like a full beard going on.

897
00:50:26.591 --> 00:50:28.090
He did.
He just,
yeah,
he's

898
00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:32.120
<v 4>17 and he's supposed to be 17 yeah,
I was 17 when I graduated from high school.</v>

899
00:50:32.121 --> 00:50:36.980
You 17 right?
Yeah.
Uh,
yeah.
No,
I was ordering.
I just guys,
well,

900
00:50:36.981 --> 00:50:39.020
even if you're 18 this guys,
a lot of guys,

901
00:50:39.021 --> 00:50:43.810
easily fucking 47 he looks like a fucking CIA agent is ridiculous.

902
00:50:44.090 --> 00:50:47.900
I think it was kind of accepted back then that they were playing a part and you

903
00:50:47.901 --> 00:50:50.750
were allowed to do that because there wasn't a whole lot of like really good

904
00:50:50.751 --> 00:50:54.100
teenage actors right now today that a lot of precocious act,

905
00:50:54.101 --> 00:50:56.780
their kids now and they all fucking look exactly the same.

906
00:50:56.930 --> 00:51:00.380
There's a lot of fucking kid actors now.
I saw,
I saw super eight last night,

907
00:51:00.700 --> 00:51:03.590
you know?
Yeah.
That's not a great get what?

908
00:51:03.591 --> 00:51:06.350
I said it's not the end kind of just spit up real quickly.
Like wait,

909
00:51:06.351 --> 00:51:09.950
that just came out of nowhere and I don't know if I like that ending with an

910
00:51:09.951 --> 00:51:11.130
attitude.
It's like,
yeah,

911
00:51:11.150 --> 00:51:16.070
well how about he was eating people one second and then 30 seconds later he's

912
00:51:16.071 --> 00:51:18.620
holding the kid and the kid's like,
I understand bad things happen.

913
00:51:18.770 --> 00:51:23.090
Bad thing happened.
This fucking thing eats people remember that?
Spoiler alert.

914
00:51:23.091 --> 00:51:27.260
Sorry.
But no,
but when you,
when you think about it,
the people that he,
he,

915
00:51:27.280 --> 00:51:28.770
he killed the creature.

916
00:51:28.790 --> 00:51:32.960
Kills are all military when he takes the cup and little girl,

917
00:51:32.970 --> 00:51:36.490
I think they all in that little little,
I thought he's going to eat the girl too.

918
00:51:36.950 --> 00:51:39.440
Let's not talk about that.
Let's where we're giving away too much information.

919
00:51:39.470 --> 00:51:43.920
It was a solid movie.
Yeah.
Don't get me wrong.
It was a real solid x men,
uh,

920
00:51:44.270 --> 00:51:47.330
first club I did too.
I actually went,
first class is bad.

921
00:51:47.331 --> 00:51:51.410
I think super eight could have had 20 more minutes and maybe just the ending.

922
00:51:51.440 --> 00:51:54.490
Maybe you're right.
But I thought that there was a,

923
00:51:54.630 --> 00:51:56.330
there was a couple of cool things about the alien,

924
00:51:56.331 --> 00:51:58.490
but it was also a lot of silliness.
Oh,
she's just like,
come on.

925
00:51:58.520 --> 00:52:01.670
Why did they always do these,
uh,
alien scenes at nighttime?

926
00:52:02.180 --> 00:52:03.800
You never see them on the phone.
Cgi.

927
00:52:03.801 --> 00:52:06.890
That's why they want to make sure that they don't have to.
Well,
you know,

928
00:52:06.950 --> 00:52:09.560
if you go back to old movies where they barely showed you anything,

929
00:52:09.561 --> 00:52:13.640
like the first alien,
God damn,
that was scary man.
That first alien movie,

930
00:52:13.641 --> 00:52:15.020
an American Werewolf in London,

931
00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:19.670
American Werewolf in London was way better than the wolf man.
But the wolf man,

932
00:52:19.671 --> 00:52:21.460
you saw way more of the creature you saw.

933
00:52:21.461 --> 00:52:24.170
I'm like moving around and grabbing and there was something kind of cool about

934
00:52:24.171 --> 00:52:28.370
that,
but the American Werewolf in London was just flashes of this thing.

935
00:52:28.371 --> 00:52:31.940
Ripping people apart,
flashes of its eyes,
flashes of its teeth.

936
00:52:32.090 --> 00:52:34.940
There's something about that,
that it's more suspenseful.

937
00:52:34.941 --> 00:52:38.210
It's more and more rewarding.
Did she ever see battle Los Angeles?

938
00:52:38.211 --> 00:52:41.330
Is that what's called?
No fucking way.
Well,
I saw the ads,
that thing,
I was like,

939
00:52:41.450 --> 00:52:44.150
fuck you got my time.

940
00:52:46.400 --> 00:52:49.700
This is something you've got to do though.
Get really baked.
Go on Netflix.

941
00:52:49.701 --> 00:52:52.770
And there's one of those copy movies that I thought it was the real movie.

942
00:52:52.771 --> 00:52:56.900
It was called battle of Los Angeles or something like one word was different

943
00:52:56.901 --> 00:53:00.680
like bottle battle in Los Angeles.
But I thought,
I thought it was it.

944
00:53:00.681 --> 00:53:05.270
So I started it and I'm just like,
wow,
these special effects,
like really bad.

945
00:53:06.050 --> 00:53:09.440
It's like he wore special effects ever.

946
00:53:09.441 --> 00:53:11.270
I mean like Amazingly Dad.

947
00:53:12.770 --> 00:53:17.390
Isn't there a thing coming up with the guy from um,

948
00:53:17.450 --> 00:53:20.210
uh,
the,
the hospital show er,
no.

949
00:53:20.211 --> 00:53:25.211
Whiling doesn't he have some TV show where there's like the aliens landed and

950
00:53:25.711 --> 00:53:26.100
they're coming

951
00:53:26.100 --> 00:53:29.400
<v 0>after people?
I don't know if I've seen that too.
I saw previous for it,</v>

952
00:53:29.401 --> 00:53:31.020
it was the previous,
before the previews.

953
00:53:31.150 --> 00:53:34.410
Now if you get to a movie or real early and before they,
even the previous star,

954
00:53:34.560 --> 00:53:39.060
they show you previews of TV shows now and,
and like local restaurants and shit.

955
00:53:39.110 --> 00:53:41.350
And I'm like,
oh,
like it's not even moving.
It's just you're done.

956
00:53:41.351 --> 00:53:45.690
The moon go outside and hang a right.
We have a fine wine selection.
Yeah.

957
00:53:45.691 --> 00:53:49.620
So anyway,
they show that and you know,
I was like,

958
00:53:49.621 --> 00:53:53.970
what is this terrible fucking show?
Like God,
these special effects look bad.

959
00:53:54.150 --> 00:53:56.790
I'm going to just looks unbelievable.
I mean maybe it's good,

960
00:53:56.791 --> 00:53:58.800
maybe I'll watch it and I'll appreciate it.

961
00:53:58.801 --> 00:54:02.490
But there's a big difference between the special effects they do and those in a

962
00:54:02.491 --> 00:54:04.380
movie like you know,
like super eight

963
00:54:04.490 --> 00:54:08.240
<v 5>and it took me 40 minutes of sitting there watching cause I was too stoned to</v>

964
00:54:08.300 --> 00:54:11.150
turn it off or switching because I wanted to see what that was like.
All right.

965
00:54:11.151 --> 00:54:13.040
This movie was supposed to be legit and I was like,

966
00:54:13.060 --> 00:54:16.400
like really angry that I was like,
why did they advertise it so much?

967
00:54:16.430 --> 00:54:18.350
This is horrible.
And then finally I was like,

968
00:54:18.351 --> 00:54:20.540
I can't take this anymore and I stop it.

969
00:54:20.541 --> 00:54:24.320
And then I was at best buy like a two days later and they had like a preview for

970
00:54:24.321 --> 00:54:27.440
like the blu ray or something.
I'm like,
oh,
that's a totally different,
oh,

971
00:54:27.470 --> 00:54:31.090
that's one of those fake movies.
I was one,
but watch it.
It's hilarious.

972
00:54:31.150 --> 00:54:35.110
<v 0>Well,
if there's ever a movie about a,
like,
like a,
a guy in a horse,
you know,</v>

973
00:54:35.500 --> 00:54:38.200
you know like black beauty or something like that.
Does it ever like some,

974
00:54:38.410 --> 00:54:41.890
some classic that's coming out?
They always like if there's a media movie,

975
00:54:41.891 --> 00:54:44.290
there's always a second media movie.
They tried to slip in

976
00:54:47.170 --> 00:54:51.730
Armageddon.
I don't know which one was first.
You know,
they always do that man.

977
00:54:51.731 --> 00:54:52.481
They always do that.

978
00:54:52.481 --> 00:54:55.060
They always try to like sneak someone in and he'll rush production.

979
00:54:55.061 --> 00:54:56.110
They all came at around the same time.

980
00:54:56.500 --> 00:54:59.200
They'll rush production to to fuck you to put their,

981
00:54:59.201 --> 00:55:01.540
their shitty version of your id out earlier.

982
00:55:01.690 --> 00:55:02.860
But then they'll tell you like what you,

983
00:55:02.861 --> 00:55:07.120
the only one can make an asteroid moving.
Fuck.
You see the point of view?

984
00:55:09.290 --> 00:55:11.600
<v 5>Yeah.
I think it's mostly for people that like,</v>

985
00:55:12.230 --> 00:55:14.280
like older people that get confused like me.
Yeah.

986
00:55:16.300 --> 00:55:18.350
<v 0>There at blockbuster and they're like,
oh</v>

987
00:55:20.160 --> 00:55:24.530
well it's sort of like we ever go to a website and you typed in the wrong word

988
00:55:24.531 --> 00:55:27.180
accidentally,
like you left an extra are on right.

989
00:55:27.290 --> 00:55:31.430
And then it goes to some crazy fucking deep anal porn site and you can't get out

990
00:55:31.431 --> 00:55:35.930
of the browser.
You're trying to click down.
Fuck man,
you can't even go backwards.

991
00:55:36.130 --> 00:55:37.480
You're like,
you're in care.
Fuck.

992
00:55:37.720 --> 00:55:42.260
And it's because they like thought that someone was going to write Google with

993
00:55:42.261 --> 00:55:45.850
two L's.
Right.
You know,
so if you're not smart enough and ready,

994
00:55:45.860 --> 00:55:47.630
if you don't Google somebody did that to my web.

995
00:55:47.690 --> 00:55:52.490
<v 3>So what's you made on my Russell peters.com they put a Russell peters.com with</v>

996
00:55:52.491 --> 00:55:57.491
one l and then they completely cut and pasted them all my shit from my website

997
00:55:58.100 --> 00:56:00.140
to that one.
And what did they do?

998
00:56:00.290 --> 00:56:02.930
Were they doing anything or was this fucking Douche bag guy?

999
00:56:03.140 --> 00:56:05.210
I don't even say his name cause I don't wanna give him any credit.

1000
00:56:05.570 --> 00:56:08.960
But he thinks he's a comic and he's a fucking Douche.

1001
00:56:09.130 --> 00:56:12.470
<v 0>So he did that.
Yeah.
Because then people,</v>

1002
00:56:12.580 --> 00:56:15.790
<v 3>because you would go to contact info and he added his number there.</v>

1003
00:56:16.060 --> 00:56:21.030
<v 0>What?
Russell Peters.
But listen.
Yeah.
How many shenanigans is ready?</v>

1004
00:56:22.190 --> 00:56:24.010
He's got his notebook and his hand.
He's been

1005
00:56:24.010 --> 00:56:26.930
<v 4>writing new material.
Tommy Shenanigans is,
uh,</v>

1006
00:56:27.130 --> 00:56:30.850
you can get them at a discounted rate.
I think about what you were going to pay.

1007
00:56:30.851 --> 00:56:34.090
Russell Peters divide that by a thousand.

1008
00:56:34.150 --> 00:56:37.350
And Tommy Shenanigans is ready to party.
Tommy,

1009
00:56:39.570 --> 00:56:42.850
Tommy Shenanigans.
Well,
Brian reservations.

1010
00:56:43.800 --> 00:56:46.210
Bailable Russell Peters with one L.
Dot com.

1011
00:56:49.190 --> 00:56:53.530
Tommy Shenanigans.
We'll be here.
Funny any man,
his whole act is about you.
I mean,

1012
00:56:53.531 --> 00:56:58.220
he's okay.
Russell Peters is kind of funny,
but come on.
He's got a headstart.

1013
00:56:58.330 --> 00:57:02.500
Everybody loves Indian COMEDIANS.
You like,
and it's the same thing.

1014
00:57:03.060 --> 00:57:07.700
<v 3>No,
you're the frozen food.
That guy sounds crazy.
Creepy Stalker Guy.</v>

1015
00:57:07.740 --> 00:57:09.880
He's a complete sociopath.
That's scary.

1016
00:57:09.890 --> 00:57:12.970
The thing that he would spend so much of his energy to put something like that

1017
00:57:12.971 --> 00:57:17.470
together.
He one time he,
um,
he did this thing where he,

1018
00:57:17.890 --> 00:57:20.710
he said to some people that were booking when he didn't think I would ever get

1019
00:57:20.711 --> 00:57:24.400
back to me,
but he fucked himself because they tried to call Angelo my,

1020
00:57:24.401 --> 00:57:28.120
one of my good friends to do the same show with them.
And uh,
and they said,

1021
00:57:28.121 --> 00:57:32.560
well yeah,
he's coming and Angelo's coming.
And Angela goes,
okay.
And they go,

1022
00:57:32.561 --> 00:57:36.370
Russell's going to be a surprise guest on the show.
And he goes,
what?
No,
he's not.

1023
00:57:36.371 --> 00:57:38.710
He's going to be in fucking wherever the fuck I was going to be that weekend.

1024
00:57:39.280 --> 00:57:42.770
And they go,
who said that?
Oh,
the guy that we booked said,
um,

1025
00:57:43.600 --> 00:57:46.630
if we pay him three grand to do the show,

1026
00:57:47.080 --> 00:57:49.750
then he'll get me to be a guest on it.

1027
00:57:50.020 --> 00:57:53.260
But you can't tell anybody that he's going to be there.
Because if you do,

1028
00:57:53.410 --> 00:57:58.230
that'll fuck up the surprise.
Oh yeah,
it's a,
you pay me two grand and a,

1029
00:57:58.240 --> 00:58:00.100
I'll bring Russell Peters if you give me three.

1030
00:58:00.490 --> 00:58:03.520
So they gave them three in the same,
but if you tell anybody that he's coming,

1031
00:58:03.521 --> 00:58:07.030
then you have to pay me three grand and um,
and,

1032
00:58:07.120 --> 00:58:09.160
and that he's not going to sway the,
obviously you knew it.

1033
00:58:09.161 --> 00:58:11.380
And so it came back to me and I was like,
really?

1034
00:58:11.381 --> 00:58:14.630
And they ended up firing him and canceling the Gig and wow.

1035
00:58:14.930 --> 00:58:19.030
But he was like doing this kind of weird fucking sneaky snake shit.

1036
00:58:19.031 --> 00:58:21.220
Like saying that he's going to get you to do guest that.
So he,

1037
00:58:21.221 --> 00:58:22.180
was he calling you a name?

1038
00:58:22.570 --> 00:58:25.720
<v 4>No,
we were not friends at all.
You're not friends at all?
No.</v>

1039
00:58:26.610 --> 00:58:29.760
<v 3>Yeah,
he was using my name like wow.
Yeah.
No,</v>

1040
00:58:29.761 --> 00:58:34.200
I cause cause he opened for me before you meet so many weird fucking people in

1041
00:58:34.201 --> 00:58:36.720
this businessman and he's not even a guy who wants to go work the road.

1042
00:58:36.721 --> 00:58:39.240
He's like one of these Douche bags and just decided he was going to do comedy

1043
00:58:39.320 --> 00:58:42.270
well and he uses jokes off the Internet.
It's fucking hard.

1044
00:58:42.430 --> 00:58:43.870
<v 4>Oh,
was a</v>

1045
00:58:43.870 --> 00:58:45.200
<v 3>complete fucking corn ball.</v>

1046
00:58:45.230 --> 00:58:49.260
It's amazing that he's so dedicated as far as like stealing your website.
Yeah.

1047
00:58:49.330 --> 00:58:51.730
Well,
we got that ceased and desisted did you

1048
00:58:53.250 --> 00:58:57.250
bring the lawyers in now you have a relationship with this guy though,
right?

1049
00:58:57.780 --> 00:59:02.500
I mean he opened for me like like three times or something and it wasn't like I

1050
00:59:02.501 --> 00:59:04.150
asked him to open for me.
He would like,

1051
00:59:04.570 --> 00:59:07.090
he would like sort of stock me and be like,
Hey,

1052
00:59:07.091 --> 00:59:09.280
I see you're going to be in Indiana this Friday.

1053
00:59:09.460 --> 00:59:12.190
I'm going to be in town there on Thursday night doing a corporate.

1054
00:59:12.400 --> 00:59:15.820
Do you mind if I do a set on the Friday?
You don't have to pay me or anything.

1055
00:59:15.850 --> 00:59:18.220
Wow.
Okay.
Wow.

1056
00:59:19.580 --> 00:59:21.620
I worked like three times and I was like,
wait a minute.

1057
00:59:22.070 --> 00:59:24.170
<v 4>Are you always where I'm going to be the day before</v>

1058
00:59:27.010 --> 00:59:31.520
basically.
I always find that that uh,
do you want,
can I do a guest set thing?

1059
00:59:31.521 --> 00:59:34.790
You started stocking march marriage.
Really?
Yeah.
What did he do?

1060
00:59:34.970 --> 00:59:38.690
He want it to be on Mark's podcast or something and or open from mark or

1061
00:59:38.691 --> 00:59:40.070
something.
And Mark was like,
no.

1062
00:59:40.480 --> 00:59:42.680
And this guy went all fucking weird like this on him too.

1063
00:59:42.770 --> 00:59:44.010
He's a fucking sociopath.

1064
00:59:44.120 --> 00:59:47.540
Did he get Mark Marin with two n's dot com probably two hours.

1065
00:59:48.800 --> 00:59:49.730
Yeah.
Wow.

1066
00:59:50.240 --> 00:59:50.980
<v 8>It's uh,</v>

1067
00:59:50.980 --> 00:59:54.250
it's interesting how many fucking real sociopath's you meet in this business.

1068
00:59:54.400 --> 00:59:56.740
People that just have this eye on the prize and they're just,

1069
00:59:56.920 --> 00:59:59.810
they're going to make it one way and they're dedicated to it.
Yeah.

1070
00:59:59.900 --> 01:00:01.010
<v 4>Yeah.
If I never made it,</v>

1071
01:00:01.011 --> 01:00:05.330
I would still be a comic work in the road and I would have no fucking delusions

1072
01:00:05.331 --> 01:00:08.180
of grandeur.
I would have just been happy doing my job.
Yeah.

1073
01:00:08.181 --> 01:00:10.220
You made it or not made it.
I still would have been a comic.

1074
01:00:10.520 --> 01:00:12.200
You know how you can tell a real comic.
I mean,

1075
01:00:12.201 --> 01:00:13.990
you can tell real comic by watching their act too.
Right.

1076
01:00:14.130 --> 01:00:16.590
<v 8>You can tell a real comic by how,
how you can hang out with them.</v>

1077
01:00:16.950 --> 01:00:20.250
And the first time we ever hung out ever was in Vegas.
Yeah.
Right.

1078
01:00:20.370 --> 01:00:24.690
First Time we ever hung out within five minutes.
I didn't know him from anything.

1079
01:00:24.770 --> 01:00:28.380
You know,
I knew,
knew his name,
he knew my name.
We met five minutes later,

1080
01:00:28.381 --> 01:00:32.640
we're fucking laughing and pointing at Shit and Kuvan on things and we're

1081
01:00:32.641 --> 01:00:34.410
putting on a show for ourselves.
You know,

1082
01:00:34.411 --> 01:00:37.860
you're having fun with comics no matter where you all on the pecking order.

1083
01:00:37.890 --> 01:00:39.300
We've all had shared experiences.

1084
01:00:39.340 --> 01:00:42.360
We've all kind of died on the cross in a really dumb fuck towns.

1085
01:00:42.390 --> 01:00:45.510
And when you meet somebody and you know that there are a standup comic,

1086
01:00:45.511 --> 01:00:48.510
like you know,
it's,
there's,
there's something to,
I mean it must,

1087
01:00:48.511 --> 01:00:50.070
the only thing they must be like is,
you know,

1088
01:00:50.071 --> 01:00:52.290
not to take anything away from people who serve in the military.

1089
01:00:52.500 --> 01:00:54.270
I don't want to connect it to that,
but it's,

1090
01:00:54.280 --> 01:00:57.930
it's almost that kind of a tight bond.
It's nothing close to being over there,

1091
01:00:57.931 --> 01:01:00.900
risking your life.
But there's a weird fraternity.
You what I'm saying?

1092
01:01:01.230 --> 01:01:04.440
The military is a bad example,
but it's a,
there's a weird fraternity,

1093
01:01:05.110 --> 01:01:09.350
the same experiences in different cities and there's so few of us when we're

1094
01:01:09.360 --> 01:01:12.710
actually working,
we're all standing alone in front of a room for the stranger.

1095
01:01:12.760 --> 01:01:14.760
Yeah.
And if you look at the numbers,
like I've,

1096
01:01:14.761 --> 01:01:18.540
I've talked to people about this before,
this is hard to consider,
but it's real.

1097
01:01:18.541 --> 01:01:22.710
300 million people in America,
maybe a thousand professional comedians.

1098
01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:25.710
Maybe out of those thousand how many of them are like national headliners?

1099
01:01:25.980 --> 01:01:30.690
Is it 200 it may be 200 we might not even be 200 out of those 200 how many of

1100
01:01:30.691 --> 01:01:32.220
them are good?
Well that's subjective,

1101
01:01:32.221 --> 01:01:34.200
but let's say it's a hundred let's say half of them suck.

1102
01:01:34.440 --> 01:01:38.370
So you're one of a hundred people in the fucking country.
That's bizarre.

1103
01:01:38.520 --> 01:01:41.400
That's bizarre shit.
That's a very strange position in the end.

1104
01:01:41.700 --> 01:01:44.370
And also how many people who set up the rooms that you set out?
Yeah.

1105
01:01:45.120 --> 01:01:46.500
A lot of that is just so you can get lucky.

1106
01:01:46.501 --> 01:01:48.360
Like Paris Hilton could sell a lot of room to,
if she was,

1107
01:01:48.420 --> 01:01:50.900
she had pink comes out of a poster is going to be a shit children.

1108
01:01:50.920 --> 01:01:54.330
It'll be shit show.
Yeah.
She's not going to get return customers.
Yeah.

1109
01:01:54.331 --> 01:01:56.230
That's the thing is,
you know,
if he just going to bomb,

1110
01:01:57.610 --> 01:02:00.420
if you can bring the hype and have an act to go with it.

1111
01:02:00.421 --> 01:02:04.110
That is certainly the case.
But there's so many of these,
a reality show people,

1112
01:02:04.111 --> 01:02:06.880
they could pack giant places if there were an orbicular answers.

1113
01:02:07.700 --> 01:02:10.860
It's fucking strange is what it is.
I mean it is,

1114
01:02:11.130 --> 01:02:15.450
it's like a joke has not just become a joke that it hasn't just become

1115
01:02:15.451 --> 01:02:16.110
mainstream.

1116
01:02:16.110 --> 01:02:19.770
It's actually taken over to the point where it's the majority of what I see on

1117
01:02:19.771 --> 01:02:20.604
television

1118
01:02:20.870 --> 01:02:24.330
<v 0>with your TV,
there's no light,
there's no creativity.
There's a story,</v>

1119
01:02:24.331 --> 01:02:27.180
there's nothing.
It is lazy.
But producers who were like,

1120
01:02:27.700 --> 01:02:29.700
we don't need to hire anybody for this.
It's like,

1121
01:02:29.730 --> 01:02:32.730
it's like if you live in a place where there's a lot of Vegan restaurants and a

1122
01:02:32.731 --> 01:02:35.520
lot of like really healthy restaurants and healthy choices,
you know,

1123
01:02:35.521 --> 01:02:39.240
you're more likely to eat healthy food if you live in a place that is,

1124
01:02:39.390 --> 01:02:42.960
all they show is housewives of Beverly Hills and all they show is,
you know,

1125
01:02:43.170 --> 01:02:46.410
New Jersey,
Jersey shore,
you're you.
I mean,
you know what I'm saying?

1126
01:02:46.411 --> 01:02:50.040
It's almost like the same thing.
It's like I got to cut.
The choices are minimal.

1127
01:02:50.041 --> 01:02:54.540
I have to confess though,
I am addicted to mobilize to what mall does it show?

1128
01:02:54.541 --> 01:02:56.910
Cool mob wives,
mob wives.
Oh yes.

1129
01:02:56.911 --> 01:03:01.440
I've been watching that mob wives and real housewives of New Jersey just to let

1130
01:03:01.441 --> 01:03:05.850
me know how happy I am that I don't have to fuck any of those monsters that I

1131
01:03:05.851 --> 01:03:10.510
don't have to date any of those.
New York,
New Jersey,
Boston,
Connecticut,

1132
01:03:10.770 --> 01:03:14.400
those beast women,
those ethnic beast women,
you know him.

1133
01:03:14.401 --> 01:03:15.870
You know what I'm talking about.
It's not all of them.

1134
01:03:15.871 --> 01:03:19.300
There's a lot of lovely women in Boston,
lovely women in New Jersey and loving.

1135
01:03:19.340 --> 01:03:23.550
Then are we saying that many women we're talking about those Italian angry beast

1136
01:03:23.551 --> 01:03:27.900
women,
those screaming,
yelling,
very specific Italian American thing.

1137
01:03:27.930 --> 01:03:31.240
It is a classic.
Canada are very different than that.
Yeah,

1138
01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:33.950
they're all first generation.
Yeah.
Is that what it only other,

1139
01:03:33.951 --> 01:03:36.390
their parents are all from Italy and then all the kids there,
you know,

1140
01:03:36.630 --> 01:03:38.490
they grew up with a slightly more respectful,

1141
01:03:38.670 --> 01:03:43.470
what's in Italy also of 2000 and whatever as opposed to an Italy of 1920s when

1142
01:03:43.540 --> 01:03:47.100
my parents came here.
Yeah.
My grandparents came here running my grandma x.

1143
01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:50.980
My grandparents came here and before that they were in the early 19 hundreds so

1144
01:03:51.010 --> 01:03:54.030
it was pretty heavy.
Schultz,
Gold American.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That,
that's,

1145
01:03:54.060 --> 01:03:57.780
there's a bunch of savages that live on that east coast,
man.
That's what it is.

1146
01:03:58.020 --> 01:04:01.590
It's a terrible place to live.
The weather's horrible.
Five months of the year.

1147
01:04:01.591 --> 01:04:05.250
It's snowy and cold and shitty and everybody's angry and there's too many people

1148
01:04:05.251 --> 01:04:08.100
stuffed into one place and that's what makes those beast women,

1149
01:04:08.250 --> 01:04:10.230
those New Jersey housewife.
Beast women.

1150
01:04:15.370 --> 01:04:16.203
<v 9>Yes.</v>

1151
01:04:17.570 --> 01:04:21.060
<v 0>They're cunty.
Yeah.
You're more than tired.</v>

1152
01:04:21.510 --> 01:04:25.430
It's against your vehicle.
Remove the y cons.

1153
01:04:25.580 --> 01:04:27.840
There's a choose different scene that in country,
you know,

1154
01:04:27.960 --> 01:04:30.760
and all the guys are these little juice head guys.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

1155
01:04:30.840 --> 01:04:33.720
Like Megan Fox is probably Cunty,
right?
Yeah.

1156
01:04:34.280 --> 01:04:36.520
One of those real housewives of New Jersey.
That's a con,
right?

1157
01:04:36.570 --> 01:04:37.650
There's a difference.
Yeah.

1158
01:04:37.670 --> 01:04:40.250
But did you think when they get to a certain age and the sort of the wide,

1159
01:04:40.251 --> 01:04:42.180
you've dropped it as soon as you know,
want to fuck them anymore.

1160
01:04:43.680 --> 01:04:47.150
They're kind of cute,
but he's still want us get them to suck your dick once,

1161
01:04:47.370 --> 01:04:49.370
once that's out of the ballgame.
You know,
like a,

1162
01:04:49.480 --> 01:04:53.130
now she's just a con Ted wrinkled,
old fucking useless bag of skin.

1163
01:04:53.131 --> 01:04:56.100
Now I know why they,
the ends with a why.
Why,
why the fuck are you here?

1164
01:04:57.120 --> 01:04:59.430
There's no one perfect fucking place to live though,
man.

1165
01:04:59.431 --> 01:05:04.230
Every place has its drawbacks.
Too Shabby.
It's the weather's wonderful.
The,
uh,

1166
01:05:04.231 --> 01:05:05.490
the traffic is unbearable.

1167
01:05:05.520 --> 01:05:08.490
I think you need money to live in the city that you do.
You need money.

1168
01:05:08.491 --> 01:05:12.030
You do need money.
And the haves and the haves nots are very widely separated.

1169
01:05:12.060 --> 01:05:15.310
Yeah.
It's funny now because when I go out,
um,

1170
01:05:15.480 --> 01:05:18.310
and I go to a restaurant or something,
I see the Paparazzi outside

1171
01:05:18.540 --> 01:05:20.280
<v 3>I in the minute they see me,
they put their cameras right.</v>

1172
01:05:22.640 --> 01:05:25.830
<v 0>Uh,
no,
not him.
He's got a great level of fame.</v>

1173
01:05:25.860 --> 01:05:28.860
You've got this sell out the old two arena,
you know,

1174
01:05:28.861 --> 01:05:30.900
didn't you do staple center to yeah,
I could do that.

1175
01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:33.750
And that was out staple center and then did you can,
you know,

1176
01:05:33.780 --> 01:05:36.390
go to Nobu and they were like,
and your name is and you,

1177
01:05:36.420 --> 01:05:39.090
you would be in your with who?
And I,
you know,

1178
01:05:39.091 --> 01:05:40.980
and I look at the people that they're kissing their ass.
I go,
really?

1179
01:05:40.981 --> 01:05:44.680
I got a black car dude,
black card.
I got my black card with me.

1180
01:05:44.681 --> 01:05:47.820
Is that black card is when an American Express and American Express is what does

1181
01:05:47.821 --> 01:05:47.941
it,

1182
01:05:47.941 --> 01:05:50.640
what do you have to deal with that you have to spend a certain money to spend a

1183
01:05:50.641 --> 01:05:54.470
certain amount initially to get it and be invited to have really how much do you

1184
01:05:54.480 --> 01:05:55.280
have to spend?

1185
01:05:55.280 --> 01:05:58.330
<v 3>Um,
I think maybe like a quarter of a million a year.</v>

1186
01:06:01.460 --> 01:06:03.140
<v 0>Do you remember what happened?
Billy Russell Peters,</v>

1187
01:06:03.141 --> 01:06:07.280
he's just bawling base made out of a titanium dude.
If I had one of those,

1188
01:06:07.281 --> 01:06:09.320
I would be wearing furs everywhere.
That's all.

1189
01:06:09.950 --> 01:06:13.580
I'm going to get some fake don still.
You still have to pay the bill.

1190
01:06:15.680 --> 01:06:18.740
That's a problem.
But I could ride that shit into the rocks for like a year.

1191
01:06:18.770 --> 01:06:21.230
I know a duty did that,
did it.
He was going bankrupt.

1192
01:06:21.231 --> 01:06:25.670
He invested in a porn company and the porn company got robbed at gunpoint and

1193
01:06:25.671 --> 01:06:29.170
they lost all their equipment.
So elegant angel.
I don't know what the name of,

1194
01:06:29.210 --> 01:06:30.560
I think it's happened to a bunch of them.

1195
01:06:30.890 --> 01:06:34.110
This was a small company that was a startup company that this my,

1196
01:06:34.180 --> 01:06:37.070
my friend was renting a house from this guy and this guy's like,
dude,

1197
01:06:37.071 --> 01:06:39.230
you can't miss.
You can make some money.
It's going to be huge.

1198
01:06:39.440 --> 01:06:42.680
So he and his dumb ass.
He goes,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
It sounds awesome.
How many,

1199
01:06:42.681 --> 01:06:46.010
you know,
one year I'll give you 100% return on your investment.
You know,

1200
01:06:46.011 --> 01:06:47.780
and you'll,
you'll own a piece of the company.

1201
01:06:47.930 --> 01:06:50.420
The company's projected to be making this much money anyway.

1202
01:06:50.780 --> 01:06:54.590
He loses everything you $30,000 he takes out of his credit cards.

1203
01:06:54.591 --> 01:06:56.510
He gets like a $30,000 loan or whatever he does.

1204
01:06:57.110 --> 01:06:59.870
He loses everything and then just decided to go bankrupt.

1205
01:06:59.871 --> 01:07:03.070
So he just goes crazy for a year,
for a year.

1206
01:07:03.100 --> 01:07:07.160
He just uses his credit cards and doesn't pay anything but the minimum and just

1207
01:07:07.161 --> 01:07:11.750
runs them up to the gills.
Just goes crazy at strip clubs every day.

1208
01:07:11.751 --> 01:07:14.860
He was getting lap dances at strip clubs.
He just lived like,

1209
01:07:14.880 --> 01:07:19.220
like a savage for one year and then he went bankrupt.
I can't do that anymore.

1210
01:07:19.370 --> 01:07:23.750
You can't do it.
They made it hard.
Yeah,
they made it very,
very difficult because,

1211
01:07:23.751 --> 01:07:27.980
um,
I know a dude who,
uh,
tried and he couldn't,
he tried to go bankrupt.

1212
01:07:27.981 --> 01:07:30.980
He owes a lot of money and they're like,
yeah,
you got to pay that.
Like,
sorry,

1213
01:07:30.981 --> 01:07:33.140
you're fucked.
You're fucked.
A 40 page,
go bankrupt.

1214
01:07:33.141 --> 01:07:35.570
You should probably pay these bills because it used to be you could,
oh,

1215
01:07:35.580 --> 01:07:39.560
like a fuck load of money.
Right.
I don't know.

1216
01:07:39.810 --> 01:07:42.830
<v 3>Okay.
I wonder what they did was they went,</v>

1217
01:07:42.831 --> 01:07:46.370
they knew they were going bankrupt and they also knew that in Florida you can

1218
01:07:46.371 --> 01:07:48.800
claim bankruptcy,
but you're allowed to keep one house.

1219
01:07:49.070 --> 01:07:53.330
So what they did was they took all their money and bought these gigantic $30

1220
01:07:53.330 --> 01:07:56.480
million fucking houses.
These fucking palaces paid,

1221
01:07:56.510 --> 01:07:59.780
paid them right out and then claim bankruptcy.
And I'm gonna get this.

1222
01:07:59.781 --> 01:08:01.040
They still sitting on 30 million.

1223
01:08:01.430 --> 01:08:04.360
<v 0>Whoa,
calm.
Connie sees the house and say,
well,</v>

1224
01:08:04.361 --> 01:08:07.390
you'd have to live with you or not in Florida.
Yeah.

1225
01:08:07.391 --> 01:08:09.240
Every state's got their own funky little rules.

1226
01:08:09.330 --> 01:08:12.910
Why Florida is a haven for gangsters.
Okay.

1227
01:08:13.150 --> 01:08:16.100
Florida is the best place to be a pill junkie.

1228
01:08:16.130 --> 01:08:20.060
<v 8>It's the easiest way to get pills.
It's,
it's a nice straight highway to New York.</v>

1229
01:08:20.061 --> 01:08:22.520
If you drive the speed limit,
chances are you won't get pulled over.

1230
01:08:22.670 --> 01:08:25.880
You can do all your creepy shit that you have to do and you can live in the warm

1231
01:08:25.881 --> 01:08:29.420
climate.
You know?
So they,
there's a lot of laws that go down in Florida.

1232
01:08:29.421 --> 01:08:30.380
If you go to Miami,

1233
01:08:30.410 --> 01:08:34.820
they'll tell you factually there's more banks per capita in Miami than any other

1234
01:08:34.821 --> 01:08:35.750
city in the country.

1235
01:08:35.990 --> 01:08:40.280
And the reason why is because that was what they used to process all the cocaine

1236
01:08:40.281 --> 01:08:42.710
money.
They use those banks.
It's that simple.

1237
01:08:43.010 --> 01:08:48.010
Florida is a gangster state that that state is just dummies and gangsters and no

1238
01:08:49.311 --> 01:08:53.750
one decides to kind of go and sort it out.
Right.
There's too much craziness.

1239
01:08:53.751 --> 01:08:57.920
And Florida,
Florida,
like every time you hear about somebody,
serial killer,

1240
01:08:58.100 --> 01:09:02.120
nutty shit happens that grow fucking killed her baby.
That Casey Anthony Bench.

1241
01:09:02.121 --> 01:09:04.520
It's on to the Florida.
Yeah.
Floor.
Fuck.
Yeah.
It's always,

1242
01:09:04.610 --> 01:09:06.680
whenever you hear Nancy Grace,
talk about some shit.

1243
01:09:06.681 --> 01:09:08.150
It's always dead babies in Florida.

1244
01:09:08.830 --> 01:09:13.220
<v 4>I'm going to jump to Suzanne.
I do,
ah,
whatsapp time.
His ex girlfriend,</v>

1245
01:09:13.221 --> 01:09:17.340
his girlfriend Russell has been with me.
Let's rephrase that.

1246
01:09:18.220 --> 01:09:22.480
What?
Wait a minute.
We've been friends for quotes on the Daily Mail.

1247
01:09:22.540 --> 01:09:24.700
Russel's been with me.
Dot Dot.
Dot.

1248
01:09:27.210 --> 01:09:28.460
<v 10>The Daily Mail.
Mal.</v>

1249
01:09:32.950 --> 01:09:35.330
<v 4>Well,
this is hate speech.
Right now what we're doing is hate speech.</v>

1250
01:09:35.900 --> 01:09:39.560
We might have to apologize.
It's just like Tracy,
Tracy Morgan,
um,

1251
01:09:39.650 --> 01:09:41.210
fundamental stab them to death,
right?

1252
01:09:41.880 --> 01:09:45.530
The story is even more depressing to me then the Tracy Morgan and because I

1253
01:09:45.531 --> 01:09:48.500
hadn't heard,
hadn't heard about that.
And I think that's the worst part about it.

1254
01:09:48.501 --> 01:09:51.230
It was like,
you know,
they had to make an example out of somebody that says,

1255
01:09:51.231 --> 01:09:54.320
Joe hasn't been on the air yet and Tracy is,
that's horrible.

1256
01:09:54.350 --> 01:09:55.490
It's still ridiculous though.

1257
01:09:55.610 --> 01:09:59.260
It's totally ridiculous because he was reacting to something and he at the

1258
01:09:59.480 --> 01:10:02.240
[inaudible] heat the moment,
but it was something which was not planned,

1259
01:10:02.420 --> 01:10:04.850
not kind of written down anywhere beforehand.

1260
01:10:04.950 --> 01:10:09.950
Tracy's routine was established that I don't think he wrote that apparently did.

1261
01:10:10.460 --> 01:10:12.830
They didn't really aren't retracing.
Maybe.
Probably not wrote it down,

1262
01:10:12.831 --> 01:10:17.300
but like Jay Z,
Jay z doesn't write his lyrics town either.
Even though you don't.

1263
01:10:17.460 --> 01:10:20.690
Right.
I can't physically I'm too lazy.

1264
01:10:21.910 --> 01:10:25.090
<v 10>That's really my reason.
I had a shape.
Joe.
I'm fucking lazy.</v>

1265
01:10:26.400 --> 01:10:27.600
<v 4>Why do you think that I need,</v>

1266
01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:30.810
which is a pain because you kind of forget routines and the rhythms.

1267
01:10:30.900 --> 01:10:33.250
<v 8>No,
it would help,
man.
You don't even have to write that down.</v>

1268
01:10:33.251 --> 01:10:36.760
But what I started doing that I really enjoyed is just writing blog entries.

1269
01:10:36.790 --> 01:10:40.420
I started writing a lot,
a lot of like,
like little essays for my blog.

1270
01:10:40.450 --> 01:10:43.450
I fucking love it.
It's a Joe Rogan daily.
Not,
not.

1271
01:10:43.480 --> 01:10:46.060
That's just a program that picks up links from my Twitter.

1272
01:10:46.290 --> 01:10:48.130
I don't have anything to do with that.
Oh really?
Yeah.

1273
01:10:48.160 --> 01:10:50.770
All I did sign up for that and then people I follow on Twitter,

1274
01:10:50.771 --> 01:10:54.560
it picks up links.
They tweet.
Yeah,
and it's random.
So,

1275
01:10:54.810 --> 01:10:56.440
but I follow a lot of interesting people,

1276
01:10:56.441 --> 01:10:59.410
but I had to stop following a bunch of months because there'd be a bunch of

1277
01:10:59.411 --> 01:11:02.780
stupid shit would show up on my daily and I'm like,
bitch,
you embarrassing me.

1278
01:11:03.130 --> 01:11:07.030
<v 4>Right,
right.
And I had a kid,
she read it like I,</v>

1279
01:11:07.031 --> 01:11:09.290
I tried it a little bit here and there,
but then I'm like,
you know what?

1280
01:11:09.320 --> 01:11:14.100
I read his Twitter and I was on Twitter yesterday.
I posted yesterday

1281
01:11:14.100 --> 01:11:17.400
<v 8>that I really want it to click the link on and I haven't done so yet.
Man,</v>

1282
01:11:17.401 --> 01:11:20.760
I'm addicted to Twitter and I'm addicted to getting information from Twitter and

1283
01:11:20.761 --> 01:11:24.440
so many fucking people on Twitter send me.
Cool Shit.
I mean is a,

1284
01:11:24.450 --> 01:11:26.010
is an incredible resource.

1285
01:11:26.250 --> 01:11:29.910
Right now I'm at 378,467 people,

1286
01:11:29.911 --> 01:11:33.000
which is way too much for me to really be paying attention to all of them at

1287
01:11:33.001 --> 01:11:37.770
99,000 and 90,000 well this is is are a lot more than me.

1288
01:11:37.830 --> 01:11:40.530
I was at Kevin Smith's place yesterday.
He's almost got like 2 million.

1289
01:11:40.531 --> 01:11:43.320
I think he's way the fuck up there.
Wow.
But there's so much,

1290
01:11:43.350 --> 01:11:46.290
there's so much comes to you when you have that many followers.

1291
01:11:46.470 --> 01:11:50.160
It's real hard to like keep track of all of it.
Like I'll,
I'll leave the room,

1292
01:11:50.460 --> 01:11:52.610
I'll go somewhere,
I'll come back in an hour and a,

1293
01:11:52.620 --> 01:11:56.670
it'll say 900 new tweet messages.
So then I'll have to try to like,

1294
01:11:56.700 --> 01:11:59.970
just try to do my best to see if there's anything in there.

1295
01:12:02.240 --> 01:12:05.010
Certain people that you will look at.

1296
01:12:06.290 --> 01:12:08.520
Kevin Smith level.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1297
01:12:08.521 --> 01:12:12.460
There's a bunch of people that I look at their shit exclusively because that guy

1298
01:12:12.470 --> 01:12:15.960
was pretty funny.
Some comic probably or some guy wants to be a comic.
Yeah.

1299
01:12:16.050 --> 01:12:18.780
It's probably a guy who wants to be a comic is comics generally don't tweet.

1300
01:12:18.781 --> 01:12:23.400
Funny Shit.
You were saving it.
I didn't see you in Toronto until the fights,

1301
01:12:23.401 --> 01:12:27.060
right?
Yeah.
We hung out in Toronto with this girl who uh,

1302
01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:31.260
has a funny a thing on.
Oh yeah,
you were saying?
Yeah.
We're trying to find,

1303
01:12:31.261 --> 01:12:35.680
her name is Kathleen Slash Lien slashing.

1304
01:12:36.960 --> 01:12:40.770
Anyway,
I forget what her,
uh,
her online,
uh,
name is,
but it's fucking hilarious.

1305
01:12:40.771 --> 01:12:41.604
And she's kind of like,

1306
01:12:41.700 --> 01:12:45.780
she has like 50,000 fucking followers or something crazy just from doing funny

1307
01:12:45.781 --> 01:12:47.940
shit.
And then people think it's funny and so they,
uh,

1308
01:12:48.210 --> 01:12:51.690
they were responding and retweet to it.
You know,
it's a,

1309
01:12:51.840 --> 01:12:53.040
it's a weird resource man.

1310
01:12:53.041 --> 01:12:55.890
There's nothing like Twitter has ever existed before where you just,

1311
01:12:56.100 --> 01:12:59.150
you're constantly getting new crazy stories from all your friends and newt

1312
01:12:59.151 --> 01:13:00.260
lengths.
And I mean,

1313
01:13:00.370 --> 01:13:03.640
<v 5>I get it for news and everything.
It's crazy.
My cable went down the other day.</v>

1314
01:13:03.641 --> 01:13:06.940
I had to at t and t Uverse and it went down for like eight hours and I was like,

1315
01:13:06.941 --> 01:13:10.840
what the fuck?
I can't even go on line to find where to go to see what's wrong.

1316
01:13:10.870 --> 01:13:14.230
Your Uverse was taken away from me.
Yeah.
So,
so I went on Twitter,

1317
01:13:14.231 --> 01:13:16.910
on my iPhone and it was like I just typed in,

1318
01:13:16.940 --> 01:13:20.470
I searched a Uverse and it was like 50,000 people just to go on man.

1319
01:13:20.500 --> 01:13:23.740
Fucking their service.
I just called,
they said it was gonna be down to 5:00 AM,

1320
01:13:23.741 --> 01:13:23.981
you know,

1321
01:13:23.981 --> 01:13:27.520
just people talking about how is that Uverse so you liking that and just suck.

1322
01:13:27.550 --> 01:13:32.290
I love it too.
But they just started capping it.
Yeah.
And the,
all the,

1323
01:13:32.320 --> 01:13:37.160
all of them are now like capping and uh,
they're supposedly monitoring your,

1324
01:13:37.170 --> 01:13:39.160
what,
you know,
how much Netflix you use and stuff.

1325
01:13:39.310 --> 01:13:42.880
But I act like I don't know all this and haven't been affected by it

1326
01:13:44.210 --> 01:13:46.870
<v 8>because when you say cabin,
yeah,
it's not like anybody's listening.</v>

1327
01:13:47.290 --> 01:13:49.480
When you say capping,
what do you mean by camping?

1328
01:13:49.580 --> 01:13:53.720
<v 5>Uh,
that like if you go past a certain amount of download,</v>

1329
01:13:54.110 --> 01:13:58.730
you download so much per month that they will either start a slowing down your

1330
01:13:58.731 --> 01:14:00.550
internet speed or stopping it.

1331
01:14:00.890 --> 01:14:04.140
<v 8>Sure.
This is how funny this bitches,
this slash lien check that I told you about,</v>

1332
01:14:04.340 --> 01:14:08.510
I just went to our Twitter page.
It's slash Lien Sla.
S.
H.
L.
E.
E.
N.

1333
01:14:08.600 --> 01:14:10.970
She's not even a comment.
She wants to be a comic but she can't commit to it.

1334
01:14:11.200 --> 01:14:13.270
Right.
I'm such an alcoholic.
You can legally drive.

1335
01:14:13.300 --> 01:14:17.950
You can't legally drive after eating me out.
That's hilarious.

1336
01:14:18.160 --> 01:14:20.800
That is funny shit dude.
I was such an alcoholic.

1337
01:14:20.801 --> 01:14:24.510
You can't legally drive after eating me out.
Dude,
that's a comic.
She's a,

1338
01:14:25.030 --> 01:14:27.480
she's a comic that just hasn't done it yet.
There's a one

1339
01:14:27.610 --> 01:14:32.140
<v 2>Gary Delaney in the UK and he normally tweets is his one liners.
He,</v>

1340
01:14:32.141 --> 01:14:34.000
that's what he does is just one line as he stands up.

1341
01:14:34.030 --> 01:14:36.880
He's a stand up here in the UK and not all he does all day long is just tweet

1342
01:14:36.881 --> 01:14:40.510
new one liners.
Which contract act.
What do you depend on?

1343
01:14:40.511 --> 01:14:42.470
What response you get from people that if they're following

1344
01:14:42.590 --> 01:14:45.510
<v 3>what,
what does it,
I don't want to,
I don't want to blow my Pontiac training.</v>

1345
01:14:45.590 --> 01:14:49.010
<v 2>Delaney spelled d.
E.
L.
A.
N.
E.
Y.</v>

1346
01:14:51.880 --> 01:14:54.110
I like good for like kind of like a timeline now.

1347
01:14:54.111 --> 01:14:57.380
So like if you do have an idea for a bit,
you put it out there.

1348
01:14:57.440 --> 01:15:00.970
So it's kind of like timestamps.
So if you hear some guy like two years later go,

1349
01:15:01.420 --> 01:15:01.860
you know,

1350
01:15:01.860 --> 01:15:03.150
<v 8>Listerine,
some of those lines,</v>

1351
01:15:03.420 --> 01:15:06.510
defibrillators are special machines to stop children lying.

1352
01:15:07.830 --> 01:15:11.370
Gary needs a hug.
I wrote that down.
Gary.

1353
01:15:12.720 --> 01:15:15.270
Whenever I see an ice cream van,
I always like to say,

1354
01:15:15.420 --> 01:15:19.770
you'll never get anyone to the hospital going at that speed.
Oh,
that's a,

1355
01:15:19.780 --> 01:15:22.890
that's a,
uh,
that's a kind of a flip of a,

1356
01:15:23.090 --> 01:15:26.400
we have a comedian in the UK in the 17th cold milk and more wise,

1357
01:15:26.760 --> 01:15:30.720
and there's a sketchers they did where a police call,
huddles,

1358
01:15:30.780 --> 01:15:33.630
huddles path and I,
you know,
the sirens blazing,
whatever.

1359
01:15:33.631 --> 01:15:37.110
And because they'll never,
they'll do have to sell ice cream at that speed.
Oh,

1360
01:15:37.111 --> 01:15:40.080
I see.
So it's a flip of that.
Wow.

1361
01:15:40.081 --> 01:15:42.960
You have to be deep into the whole English sit of mine.

1362
01:15:43.110 --> 01:15:44.640
That's like a Benny Hill joke.
Yeah.

1363
01:15:48.990 --> 01:15:52.620
Yeah.
Okay.
Stephen.
Right.
We're talking about this yesterday.

1364
01:15:52.621 --> 01:15:55.920
Is writing a novel on Twitter?
If you don't know,
it goes dry and Steven,
right?

1365
01:15:55.921 --> 01:16:00.520
Yeah.
He's literally writing a novel on Twitter every day.
He,
uh,
ads.

1366
01:16:01.560 --> 01:16:02.680
Yup.
Yup.

1367
01:16:02.920 --> 01:16:07.230
Long time and TBC to be continued as at the end of almost every tweet.

1368
01:16:07.530 --> 01:16:12.480
It's the most ridiculous shit ever.
157 counties.
Yes,
exactly.

1369
01:16:12.481 --> 01:16:13.550
And then it's TV sake.

1370
01:16:13.830 --> 01:16:16.440
It is the most ridiculous shit you've ever seen in your life.

1371
01:16:16.470 --> 01:16:19.020
It's really hard to believe that he's actually committed to doing this.

1372
01:16:19.800 --> 01:16:23.010
But it's fascinating,
you know,
that's one of the many uses.

1373
01:16:24.420 --> 01:16:25.680
How often do you use the Twitter?

1374
01:16:26.360 --> 01:16:30.020
<v 3>I'm not a,
I'm not that a diligent,
I read it more than I tweet it.</v>

1375
01:16:31.280 --> 01:16:34.760
Do you ever tweet jokey things?
Like what do you put on it and that,
you know,

1376
01:16:34.761 --> 01:16:37.990
I'm mostly,
I think I'm most active when there's a fight on really.

1377
01:16:38.150 --> 01:16:42.720
I give fight commentaries the whole time and I think they're pretty,

1378
01:16:42.770 --> 01:16:45.380
people find them fair,
fairly entertaining as far as I can tell.

1379
01:16:45.440 --> 01:16:49.190
Do you do comedy fight,
fight?
Uh,
yeah.
You know,
I'll say it like,
uh,

1380
01:16:49.790 --> 01:16:52.400
what was his name?
Just fought fucking two weeks ago.

1381
01:16:52.740 --> 01:16:55.920
<v 8>Just had dinner with my agents.
I paid,
uh,</v>

1382
01:16:57.610 --> 01:17:00.360
<v 3>what was his name was just fine.
He dropped down in weight,</v>

1383
01:17:01.860 --> 01:17:05.300
dropped down to featherweight and UFC.
Oh,
Kenny Florian.
Kenny Florian.
I was,

1384
01:17:06.530 --> 01:17:08.740
I said wow.
Ben Stiller looked really great and no fight.

1385
01:17:10.350 --> 01:17:14.870
<v 8>How about Sam stouts knockout though.
It was crazy.
That was fucking,
it was scary.</v>

1386
01:17:14.990 --> 01:17:16.080
It was scary.
Yeah.

1387
01:17:16.250 --> 01:17:18.890
There's a certain amount of times where a guy gets knocked out where it becomes

1388
01:17:18.891 --> 01:17:23.240
easy to get them to get them to shut off and Sam style can really punch.

1389
01:17:23.241 --> 01:17:24.074
He's a good puncher,

1390
01:17:24.170 --> 01:17:28.040
but I didn't like the way you've went out like that disturbed me.

1391
01:17:28.070 --> 01:17:30.770
I mean he got caught perfectly but it just seemed like,

1392
01:17:30.771 --> 01:17:33.830
man that was a bad knock out.
That was a bad one.

1393
01:17:33.860 --> 01:17:37.150
That was one where you really got to assess whether or not you're done.

1394
01:17:37.270 --> 01:17:38.570
How are these guys going to,
yeah,

1395
01:17:38.810 --> 01:17:41.780
cause you know there's certain shots at the guy who gets hit with like you.

1396
01:17:41.790 --> 01:17:44.510
Like of course that knocked him out.
Like when when Gabriel,

1397
01:17:44.511 --> 01:17:47.060
Gonzaga head kick cro cop.
Like,
that's just,

1398
01:17:47.150 --> 01:17:50.650
that's one of those shots we get hit by that you go out,
you know,

1399
01:17:50.710 --> 01:17:53.090
it's just how it goes.
That's natural selection.

1400
01:17:53.120 --> 01:17:55.330
But then there's certain shots like when,
when,
uh,

1401
01:17:55.340 --> 01:17:57.440
rich Franklin knocked out chuck Ladell and they're fine.

1402
01:17:57.660 --> 01:17:59.540
They're the right hand that knocked him out.
You're like,
wow,

1403
01:17:59.541 --> 01:18:02.540
that I don't think that would have knocked chuck out five years ago.
Oh,
you know,

1404
01:18:02.770 --> 01:18:05.480
but it put them out.
Now you've got a crack on your chin.

1405
01:18:05.481 --> 01:18:10.130
That's exactly once and it's done.
What protection do they have in,
in UFC?

1406
01:18:11.510 --> 01:18:14.920
That's it.
And your wits.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1407
01:18:14.930 --> 01:18:19.220
You have a gum shield shield come from fucking grinding.
Yeah,
but what about,

1408
01:18:20.020 --> 01:18:24.080
but no jock.
Strap pull.
No.
Yeah.
You were a cop.
Yeah.
You were a cup.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1409
01:18:24.081 --> 01:18:27.110
You were a cup smart guys.
There's a,
there's actually a,
a,

1410
01:18:27.150 --> 01:18:30.350
a cup I'm going to try out tonight.
It's called diamond MMA.

1411
01:18:30.351 --> 01:18:34.400
The develop some new system with a compression short to keep the cup from moving

1412
01:18:34.700 --> 01:18:39.530
on your balls.
It's like,
keeps it all like slammed up.
Sneak out.
Yeah.

1413
01:18:39.531 --> 01:18:40.570
So even if you get kicked,

1414
01:18:40.590 --> 01:18:43.070
you're not going to get hurt because there's been a bunch of guys who have been

1415
01:18:43.071 --> 01:18:46.640
really hurt pretty fucking badly from cups sliding into their balls.

1416
01:18:46.760 --> 01:18:49.910
But apparently they say that the,
the best solution is the old time way.

1417
01:18:49.911 --> 01:18:51.680
The Ty Cup,
the Thai Cup,

1418
01:18:51.681 --> 01:18:55.340
they would tie on and it's made out of steel and this steel cup,

1419
01:18:55.341 --> 01:18:58.730
they just mash your balls into it and tie it in place like really tight.

1420
01:18:58.940 --> 01:19:03.170
And that's supposed to be one of the best options to old school Thailand style

1421
01:19:03.171 --> 01:19:03.680
bro.

1422
01:19:03.680 --> 01:19:08.680
With a big fucking steel shield over your Dick and balls and old tie Cup Cup.

1423
01:19:11.330 --> 01:19:13.070
It's got a calendar.
I'll tell you what,
man,

1424
01:19:13.071 --> 01:19:15.540
I enjoyed watching Strikeforce this weekend cause I didn't have time.

1425
01:19:16.170 --> 01:19:20.900
I was doing a show.
I,
Ooh,
I have Grand Prix.

1426
01:19:20.950 --> 01:19:25.310
Yeah,
well Josh Barnett just destroyed Brett Rodgers.

1427
01:19:25.460 --> 01:19:28.340
He ran,
he ran through it,
man.

1428
01:19:28.341 --> 01:19:30.170
I mean he's said Brett Rogers is a really tough guy,

1429
01:19:30.171 --> 01:19:32.990
but he doesn't have those skills.
He doesn't,
he's not,

1430
01:19:32.991 --> 01:19:35.690
it doesn't have a real ground game.
His striking game,
he's rudimentary.

1431
01:19:35.691 --> 01:19:38.390
He just hits hard,
you know.
And that's,
that's what he's good for.
And He needs,

1432
01:19:38.630 --> 01:19:42.020
he needs a comprehensive overhaul of his game and against the grappler,

1433
01:19:42.021 --> 01:19:45.470
like Barnett Barnett is too strong on the ground.
He got them down to the ground,

1434
01:19:45.471 --> 01:19:46.191
just smashed them.

1435
01:19:46.191 --> 01:19:49.400
And then the second round got him in an arm triangle and he tapped even before

1436
01:19:49.401 --> 01:19:52.320
he got to the side.
Oh,
by the way,
I want to ask you about that.
Uh,

1437
01:19:52.790 --> 01:19:56.780
did you notice that it looked like the Santo is tapping as the fucking bell
ring?

1438
01:19:57.230 --> 01:20:00.020
Junior dos Santos?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Someone had said that before.

1439
01:20:00.021 --> 01:20:04.040
I didn't think it looked like when I watched it right there I go.
He had fucking,

1440
01:20:04.041 --> 01:20:08.030
uh,
Carmen had him in that fucking choke.
Real good.
Yeah.
And,

1441
01:20:08.160 --> 01:20:12.870
<v 3>and as it was literally,
it was like this and,
and then his hand was like,</v>

1442
01:20:12.871 --> 01:20:16.530
right about to touch his,
literally like,
it was like Dang.
And it was like,

1443
01:20:16.920 --> 01:20:20.610
and he let go and he was like,
even he looks shocked.
Like he's not sure if he,

1444
01:20:20.690 --> 01:20:22.290
you got to watch that back right at the last,

1445
01:20:22.590 --> 01:20:25.440
if there was three seconds more in that fight,
there was,
he would have tapped,

1446
01:20:26.100 --> 01:20:29.280
oh fuck yeah,
that he had of it.
I would have to see it again.

1447
01:20:29.310 --> 01:20:32.460
There was no getting out of that too and he hadn't been in somewhat of an

1448
01:20:32.461 --> 01:20:33.580
Anaconda choke in it.

1449
01:20:35.240 --> 01:20:36.073
<v 8>I have to see it again.</v>

1450
01:20:36.260 --> 01:20:40.640
Even if you fucked up with this with what would you guys have gotten?

1451
01:20:40.641 --> 01:20:45.230
Broken arms,
broken legs,
knocked con on.
The guys got knocked unconscious.

1452
01:20:45.470 --> 01:20:46.610
No one's died.
Okay.

1453
01:20:46.910 --> 01:20:50.030
But they've got real good safety precautions and the referees are good at

1454
01:20:50.031 --> 01:20:52.880
stopping fights and what's really dangerous when you see a boxing match,

1455
01:20:52.881 --> 01:20:55.070
but it's really dangerous.
It's not just getting hit once.

1456
01:20:55.250 --> 01:20:58.880
What's really dangerous is heading blows that don't knock you out exactly where

1457
01:20:58.881 --> 01:21:03.200
you get knocked down and then they count you to the count of eight and then dust

1458
01:21:03.201 --> 01:21:05.600
your gloves off three or get back in there and the UFC.

1459
01:21:05.601 --> 01:21:08.120
If you get cracked and dropped,
the guy jumps on you and hits you again.

1460
01:21:08.121 --> 01:21:08.990
If you're dazed,

1461
01:21:09.140 --> 01:21:12.830
you're going to get knocked unconscious or you're going to get days to the point

1462
01:21:12.831 --> 01:21:15.380
where the referee has to pull you off and believe it or not,

1463
01:21:15.381 --> 01:21:18.470
you are actually safer that way it's going to save you a tremendous amount of

1464
01:21:18.471 --> 01:21:18.921
punishment.

1465
01:21:18.921 --> 01:21:22.700
So if you get like dropped and rocked really badly in the fifth round,

1466
01:21:22.850 --> 01:21:27.410
but somehow or another you,
you managed to stand up and by the count of 10,

1467
01:21:27.470 --> 01:21:30.200
you get your wits about you just enough to hold on and then you get dropped

1468
01:21:30.201 --> 01:21:32.540
again the next round and they get dropped again the next round.

1469
01:21:32.750 --> 01:21:35.260
Those are the fights that really can fuck a guy up and kill him.

1470
01:21:35.340 --> 01:21:38.360
<v 3>I've seen it more likely though.
We're a guy gets,
uh,</v>

1471
01:21:38.430 --> 01:21:43.050
it gets knocked out with a punch and he hits the canvas and the other guy jumps

1472
01:21:43.051 --> 01:21:45.570
on him and hits him again and actually wakes him the fuck up.

1473
01:21:46.120 --> 01:21:49.360
<v 8>Yeah.
I don't know if that's the truth.
Um,
people always say that,</v>

1474
01:21:49.361 --> 01:21:50.920
that I knocked them down and I woke him up.

1475
01:21:50.950 --> 01:21:53.150
<v 3>I think I've seen,
I've seen the guy hit and I go,
oh fuck.</v>

1476
01:21:53.151 --> 01:21:55.370
He's out and then hit some of them.
The guys all of a sudden,
okay,

1477
01:21:56.020 --> 01:21:59.020
<v 8>he might've probably jumped out anyway.
See the problem with it,
it does.</v>

1478
01:21:59.021 --> 01:22:03.570
It doesn't coincide with the,
the natural reaction of a concussive blow.

1479
01:22:03.930 --> 01:22:06.720
The national reaction of a concussive blows not to wake you up.

1480
01:22:06.721 --> 01:22:10.500
It's just shut you down further.
And if you have a tendency to get shut off,

1481
01:22:10.501 --> 01:22:12.720
especially if you've been shut off before the,
your,

1482
01:22:12.721 --> 01:22:16.590
your brain actually recognizing that as recognizes that as a pattern.
So it's,
Oh,

1483
01:22:16.591 --> 01:22:17.610
we're under attack again.

1484
01:22:17.611 --> 01:22:21.330
The shutoff and preserve all functions and just let everything go.

1485
01:22:21.850 --> 01:22:24.990
So I don't think it really does wake you up.
Are there many surprise?

1486
01:22:24.991 --> 01:22:25.824
I might be wrong though.

1487
01:22:26.700 --> 01:22:29.780
<v 3>Seen it happened.
Like when it looks like the guys out on the way down,</v>

1488
01:22:29.810 --> 01:22:30.501
it might just look like,

1489
01:22:30.501 --> 01:22:33.320
it looks like he's out on the way down and then he hits and then Bam,

1490
01:22:33.321 --> 01:22:35.570
and then he,
and then he starts to react again.

1491
01:22:35.710 --> 01:22:38.840
But are there any surprises in the UFC fight?
Can you kind of predict

1492
01:22:39.210 --> 01:22:43.440
<v 8>who's going kind of come out the winner?
No,
there's always surprises.</v>

1493
01:22:43.441 --> 01:22:45.480
It's one of the most shocking sports ever.

1494
01:22:45.481 --> 01:22:47.560
There's always something that happens in freaks you out like this,

1495
01:22:47.561 --> 01:22:52.530
this fight between Todd Duffy and Mike [inaudible] and Mike Russo is a,

1496
01:22:52.590 --> 01:22:57.240
like,
he's got a lot of body fat on him and he's a,
he's a big fucking tough guys,

1497
01:22:57.241 --> 01:22:59.670
a Chicago cop,
but he looks like,
you know,

1498
01:22:59.671 --> 01:23:03.910
like a guy like privately played football in college,
but now he works,
you know,

1499
01:23:03.930 --> 01:23:06.070
as an accountant and he likes to eat a lot of sandwiches,

1500
01:23:06.200 --> 01:23:08.830
you know what I'm saying?
But this Guy Todd Duffy,

1501
01:23:08.831 --> 01:23:10.570
it looks like he was created in a laboratory.

1502
01:23:10.840 --> 01:23:14.800
I mean he shredded sculpting and he's got this fucking big captain America.

1503
01:23:14.801 --> 01:23:19.000
He man jaw and he just looks like the last motherfucker you'd want to fight.

1504
01:23:19.240 --> 01:23:21.430
Just looks like a super athlete.
And this guy,

1505
01:23:21.431 --> 01:23:26.100
Todd Duffy puts a beating on Mike Russell for two and a half rounds.
Wow.

1506
01:23:26.110 --> 01:23:27.280
And then the third round,

1507
01:23:27.310 --> 01:23:31.870
Mike Russell connects with one punch at a nowhere and Todd Duffy goes off.

1508
01:23:31.910 --> 01:23:34.840
Boink shuts completely off,
falls to the ground.

1509
01:23:34.960 --> 01:23:37.960
And Mike Russell hits him one more time when he's out.
Wow.
Yeah.

1510
01:23:38.170 --> 01:23:39.280
He hits him all the time,
by the way,

1511
01:23:39.281 --> 01:23:41.710
with an arm that was broken in the first round.

1512
01:23:41.950 --> 01:23:43.980
He got kicked in the arm and the first round was broken arm.

1513
01:23:44.030 --> 01:23:47.140
Mike Russell and Todd Duffy,
I dunno,
maybe a year ago,

1514
01:23:47.760 --> 01:23:51.400
I want to say a year somewhere around UFC.
Incredible fight.

1515
01:23:51.550 --> 01:23:55.630
Ridiculous turnaround.
One Punch,
knockout,
unexpected.

1516
01:23:55.750 --> 01:23:59.500
No one saw it coming.
This guy,
Todd Duffy looked like he was a future contender.

1517
01:23:59.660 --> 01:24:01.750
I mean,
you look at him and like,
this kid's a fucking destroyer.
I mean,

1518
01:24:01.751 --> 01:24:03.500
look at this kid like,
how do you fuck with this kid?

1519
01:24:03.501 --> 01:24:06.940
He's like 250 pounds moves like a gazelle smashing people.

1520
01:24:06.941 --> 01:24:07.920
He just looked like one of those guys.

1521
01:24:07.920 --> 01:24:11.050
It was just going to launch it to the top of the heap like really quickly.

1522
01:24:11.200 --> 01:24:14.470
All of a sudden out Kohl's one punch.
That's how crazy this sport is.

1523
01:24:14.640 --> 01:24:16.890
It was the other one with the guy that knocked him out eating a sandwich at a

1524
01:24:16.891 --> 01:24:21.610
time.
He could have been,
he's just one of those fucking tough Chicago guy.

1525
01:24:22.300 --> 01:24:26.830
MMA fighters have a shorter shelf life than a boxer does.
Probably.
Um,

1526
01:24:26.831 --> 01:24:30.850
their training is way more rigorous probably,
but then the way longer and harder.

1527
01:24:30.851 --> 01:24:33.790
But if you look at Randy couture and he lasted a long time,
you know,

1528
01:24:33.791 --> 01:24:37.360
I think he's down to the rule.
Yeah,
you're right.

1529
01:24:37.810 --> 01:24:40.710
It's not so bad when he lost in Toronto,
man,
it was a bad one.

1530
01:24:40.711 --> 01:24:44.650
I got teary eyed to come.
Well,
you know,
I didn't feel sad.

1531
01:24:45.010 --> 01:24:46.120
It was a crazy kick.

1532
01:24:46.760 --> 01:24:50.740
I didn't feel sad because the guy had a long and storied career and goes down as

1533
01:24:50.741 --> 01:24:53.110
one of the grades and was saying,
you know,
hey,

1534
01:24:53.111 --> 01:24:57.160
this is a real big challenge and if I could beat this guy,
um,
you know,
I'm,
I'm,

1535
01:24:57.190 --> 01:25:00.190
you know,
back in the hunt and maybe I get a shot at the title and you know,

1536
01:25:00.810 --> 01:25:03.910
he was thinking crazy thoughts.
You know,
I was thinking like,
hey,
you never know.

1537
01:25:03.940 --> 01:25:06.580
You know,
or this could be my last fight,
win,
lose or draw.

1538
01:25:06.581 --> 01:25:08.770
Like I heard a bunch of different stories,
you know,

1539
01:25:08.771 --> 01:25:13.270
but to have him go out like that,
like at least with an exciting loss,
you know,

1540
01:25:13.271 --> 01:25:13.931
just get kicked out.

1541
01:25:13.931 --> 01:25:16.090
I mean you got dropped and he got his teeth knocked out and everything,

1542
01:25:17.050 --> 01:25:21.640
but he's not a part of history.
It's like,

1543
01:25:21.641 --> 01:25:24.970
it's almost like has to go out that way.
It was a big rest dance.

1544
01:25:24.971 --> 01:25:27.700
Everyone just lost,
but he's just got it.
Yeah.
He just lost,

1545
01:25:27.701 --> 01:25:31.780
he just got knocked out by some really tough young kid and this tough young kid

1546
01:25:31.781 --> 01:25:32.780
is like,
uh,
you know,

1547
01:25:33.030 --> 01:25:36.670
in his thirties think maybe even younger dentists ever stop talking about

1548
01:25:36.810 --> 01:25:41.020
couture's age.
Right?
He's older.
He's in his 50s.
Wow.
Yeah.
I'm still fighting.

1549
01:25:41.020 --> 01:25:44.600
Still finding was still active.
Yeah.
It's uh,
it's not,

1550
01:25:44.620 --> 01:25:46.840
it's a young man's sport dude.
That's for fucking sure.

1551
01:25:47.520 --> 01:25:50.050
I had a conversation with Forrest Griffin about it recently and he was talking

1552
01:25:50.051 --> 01:25:52.540
about how when he was younger he would fight totally different.

1553
01:25:52.541 --> 01:25:54.160
Like now he thinks about it like,
fuck,

1554
01:25:54.730 --> 01:25:56.320
this fucking guy is going to hurt me and this,

1555
01:25:56.321 --> 01:26:00.900
this could hurt my fucking shoulders hurt.
Yeah.
You start to second guess should,

1556
01:26:00.970 --> 01:26:03.920
yeah.
We started to think,
to start to be intelligent.
You start,

1557
01:26:04.180 --> 01:26:08.460
do you start to also like combine risk and reward and calculate them up and go,

1558
01:26:08.490 --> 01:26:10.370
hmm,
what's in this for me?
You know,

1559
01:26:10.400 --> 01:26:12.830
especially you see that in a lot of fighters that really,

1560
01:26:13.070 --> 01:26:15.740
realistically we'll probably never be champion.
You know,

1561
01:26:15.741 --> 01:26:18.560
there's a lot of guys that you see them and they're like,
well this guy is just,

1562
01:26:18.561 --> 01:26:21.680
he really doesn't have the skills to ever beat a guy like Anderson Silva.

1563
01:26:21.860 --> 01:26:23.480
So what happens to him,
you know,

1564
01:26:23.540 --> 01:26:26.810
while they slowly somewhere along the line lose the fire.

1565
01:26:27.050 --> 01:26:30.800
Is John Jones Fighting Anderson?
No.
Jon Jones is going to fight rampage.

1566
01:26:32.020 --> 01:26:34.970
I could could take rampage.
Uh,
I think it's an exciting fight.

1567
01:26:35.420 --> 01:26:38.090
Rampage has got some fucking history,
man.
He knows a lot of shit.

1568
01:26:38.960 --> 01:26:40.130
Does anybody want a coconut water?

1569
01:26:40.370 --> 01:26:43.300
<v 4>Oh,
these coconut water.</v>

1570
01:26:45.040 --> 01:26:47.180
<v 5>So you've been doing any deejaying lately?
I,
yeah,</v>

1571
01:26:47.220 --> 01:26:49.120
just got that DJ APP on my iPad.

1572
01:26:49.121 --> 01:26:53.710
I've been fucking around with deejaying in my house.
That's true.
Nice.
Thank you.

1573
01:26:54.300 --> 01:26:55.133
Hi.
Uh,
I've been teaching

1574
01:26:55.220 --> 01:26:58.300
<v 4>and my house actually haven't touched the turntables and a couple of days I'm</v>

1575
01:26:58.301 --> 01:27:00.640
actually going through withdrawals.
So when I get home tonight,

1576
01:27:01.500 --> 01:27:05.560
I'm going to go out to dinner with,
uh,
with the family.
You Dj in your house,

1577
01:27:05.561 --> 01:27:08.500
like you have people over and have sparring fuck around by yourself.

1578
01:27:08.630 --> 01:27:11.230
<v 5>Yeah.
That's like hitting a bag.
Keep yourself sharp.</v>

1579
01:27:11.520 --> 01:27:14.890
You ever get one of those boxes where it's just tons of different,
uh,

1580
01:27:14.950 --> 01:27:17.110
sounds like you can program each thing to do it.
Yeah.

1581
01:27:17.160 --> 01:27:20.760
<v 4>Oh,
sound the little a and they're like all colored the,</v>

1582
01:27:20.770 --> 01:27:23.420
I know what you're talking about.
The um,
we have to see color doses.

1583
01:27:23.580 --> 01:27:27.240
Don't say black.
It's a faggot.
Barks

1584
01:27:29.850 --> 01:27:31.170
retract that statement.

1585
01:27:32.640 --> 01:27:34.260
<v 5>But yeah,
I was looking at those late,
like thinking about,</v>

1586
01:27:34.261 --> 01:27:38.030
that'd be cool to like program maybe controller.
Yeah.
That's it.
Many controller,

1587
01:27:38.070 --> 01:27:39.810
colleague,
no.
Yeah,
they're cool.
I don't know.

1588
01:27:39.890 --> 01:27:42.860
<v 4>I don't fuck with them.
I have this thing called the dicer,</v>

1589
01:27:43.400 --> 01:27:46.970
but you attach to your turntables and then you can hit your cue points and then

1590
01:27:46.971 --> 01:27:50.450
you can loop shit right there.
That's always,
it's fun for me.

1591
01:27:50.451 --> 01:27:52.790
Cause something else to play with.

1592
01:27:52.850 --> 01:27:55.520
<v 5>Have you ever mixed like your act into music?</v>

1593
01:27:55.580 --> 01:27:58.790
Because that's what I was mixing a Jenna Hayes's Mons,

1594
01:27:58.791 --> 01:28:01.580
the orgasm sounds and two songs and I thought it was kind of interesting doing

1595
01:28:01.581 --> 01:28:02.410
it man is I,

1596
01:28:02.410 --> 01:28:07.120
<v 4>I did Lopez tonight a couple of weeks ago,
about a month ago and uh,</v>

1597
01:28:07.360 --> 01:28:11.230
and the guests were,
uh,
Paul Stanley and Randy Jackson.
Paul Stanley from kiss.

1598
01:28:11.280 --> 01:28:13.360
Yeah.
And I was the biggest kiss fan growing up,

1599
01:28:13.361 --> 01:28:15.920
so I was like a little girl that day.
Anyway.
So,
uh,

1600
01:28:16.150 --> 01:28:18.820
do you think that the guy from kiss it had some work done?
No,
not at all.

1601
01:28:19.180 --> 01:28:22.630
Certainly natural.
Naturally pulled face.
Yeah.

1602
01:28:22.631 --> 01:28:24.490
Everybody lives like that when they're 90.
Yeah.

1603
01:28:25.630 --> 01:28:29.800
Everyone got it comes real hair color too.
This is totally real hair color.

1604
01:28:29.860 --> 01:28:33.670
So Paul Stanley joins the house band.
Uh,
that night starts playing.

1605
01:28:33.850 --> 01:28:36.580
Then Randy Jackson grabs a base and starts playing with the house band.

1606
01:28:36.880 --> 01:28:40.660
And then we had already set up my turn,
my laptop and turntables to be there.

1607
01:28:40.900 --> 01:28:43.990
So I joined the band.
I started scratching with them,
but I was scratching Lopez,

1608
01:28:43.991 --> 01:28:47.620
his voice.
Oh,
that's awesome.
That's good.
It should be on youtube somewhere.
Oh,

1609
01:28:47.621 --> 01:28:52.480
that's cool.
Cutting it up with them.
You Love Dj and,
Huh?
I love Chang.

1610
01:28:53.230 --> 01:28:57.130
Wow.
I too thing if you ever have a private party and you,

1611
01:28:57.280 --> 01:28:59.650
I will fucking DJ the shit out of.
That would be awesome.

1612
01:29:00.190 --> 01:29:02.790
When's your birthday come up with a reason to have a private party now.

1613
01:29:03.150 --> 01:29:05.970
My birthday's in August.
Let's have a birthday.
August party.

1614
01:29:06.280 --> 01:29:09.000
Maybe I'm going to find out if I'm around.
That would be,

1615
01:29:09.060 --> 01:29:12.480
that would be bad ass dude.
Where would we have it?
Where would we do it?

1616
01:29:12.570 --> 01:29:17.280
Wherever you want to do it somewhere.
Cool,
Brian and suggestions.

1617
01:29:17.350 --> 01:29:20.310
Uh,
she's having a fucking party,
man.

1618
01:29:20.580 --> 01:29:23.280
We should have a once a year sort of a festival.

1619
01:29:23.281 --> 01:29:26.340
It doesn't have to be my bird birthday.
But why don't you tell him about,

1620
01:29:26.460 --> 01:29:30.140
why do you have an official Joe Rogan after party after one of the fights?
Vega.

1621
01:29:30.510 --> 01:29:33.360
Maybe you've done that a few times.
Yeah,
we've done that a bunch of times,

1622
01:29:33.630 --> 01:29:37.620
but we've done that at clubs too.
We know like in Vegas where they will supply,

1623
01:29:37.621 --> 01:29:40.770
you know,
set you up a place.
Yeah,
I think,
um,

1624
01:29:41.130 --> 01:29:44.250
I was with buffer at the last one at uh,
excess.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1625
01:29:44.251 --> 01:29:48.270
We're talking about may buffer and Forrest Griffin and Jake shields and she has

1626
01:29:48.280 --> 01:29:52.530
dance together.
We totally slow danced.
Nice.
Say something and he's a grinder

1627
01:29:54.690 --> 01:29:55.660
and it would,

1628
01:29:57.060 --> 01:30:00.210
we were talking about the gathering of the Juggalos the other day about how it's

1629
01:30:00.211 --> 01:30:03.720
fascinating that these guys have managed to way to get all these disenfranchised

1630
01:30:03.721 --> 01:30:07.470
kids and,
and bring them out and you know,
and,
and give them something to do,

1631
01:30:07.500 --> 01:30:10.440
you know,
and have this like this,
this festival where everybody gets together.

1632
01:30:10.441 --> 01:30:12.990
I'm like organizing something like that though.

1633
01:30:13.020 --> 01:30:15.690
Like would actually be kind of fun,
you know,

1634
01:30:15.691 --> 01:30:20.550
organize like having one like one weekend somewhere or one,
one something,

1635
01:30:20.580 --> 01:30:25.410
some sort of,
uh,
you know,
some sort of a holiday sort of,
or something to it.

1636
01:30:26.020 --> 01:30:28.710
I don't have to,
I'm Russell Peters is down.
I'm down here down.

1637
01:30:28.800 --> 01:30:31.650
Which should we do?
I don't know,
but I'll be playing classic rock,
funk,

1638
01:30:31.651 --> 01:30:35.670
disco and hip hop.
I like it,
dude.
It makes all that shit together.
I do.

1639
01:30:35.960 --> 01:30:37.770
I know all vinyl or you do digital?

1640
01:30:37.771 --> 01:30:40.890
I do it all digitally because it's too fucking much music to try and carry all

1641
01:30:40.891 --> 01:30:44.400
those records.
Yeah,
that's ridiculous,
right?
Oh,
it's loud as fuck.

1642
01:30:44.430 --> 01:30:48.210
You really gonna hear the compression.
Somebody sent me something that three,

1643
01:30:48.420 --> 01:30:50.250
three 90 bit like that.
There's,

1644
01:30:50.280 --> 01:30:53.140
there's really high bit rate fucking navy freeze here.

1645
01:30:53.180 --> 01:30:57.720
They sound distorted and loud.
Do they?
Yeah.
It's turning up the volume.

1646
01:30:57.900 --> 01:31:00.500
It takes too much space on your iTunes.
Does it?

1647
01:31:00.510 --> 01:31:03.030
How much it would be like 10 gigs are still takes a lot.
A lot more.

1648
01:31:03.031 --> 01:31:05.340
I took all my iTunes and and betrayed them.

1649
01:31:05.340 --> 01:31:08.850
Lowered them all to one 20 or something like 1.8 yeah.
Really?

1650
01:31:09.120 --> 01:31:13.110
But my a fuck about me and my music for deejaying is at a higher bit rate

1651
01:31:13.111 --> 01:31:17.230
quality.
It's around two something.
Two 50 so for yourself,
you,

1652
01:31:17.280 --> 01:31:21.840
you give yourself less than you give your fans know for for my,
for my iTunes,

1653
01:31:21.841 --> 01:31:24.570
that is correct.
For my iPod and you get less.

1654
01:31:25.080 --> 01:31:27.360
But when I'm playing for you it's all about you.

1655
01:31:27.420 --> 01:31:30.060
That's what I'm saying and I'm saying is with,
if I'm playing your party,

1656
01:31:30.061 --> 01:31:33.030
there will be no music played that was made after 2000 really?

1657
01:31:33.080 --> 01:31:37.950
It'll be all pre 2000 nice.
That's the century.
I got a problem,

1658
01:31:37.951 --> 01:31:41.520
man.
I,
if I have the choice between listening to something from the sixties or

1659
01:31:41.520 --> 01:31:43.860
seventies or something from the,
the,
you know,
the current era,

1660
01:31:43.861 --> 01:31:47.670
I always go with sixties and seventies it's some longing for nostalgia or

1661
01:31:47.671 --> 01:31:49.560
something.
Yeah,
it takes you back to a different place.

1662
01:31:49.790 --> 01:31:52.560
It's a different kind of music man.
It's a different,
you know,

1663
01:31:52.561 --> 01:31:55.590
it's like when you listen to is like some Allman brothers from the 70s there's

1664
01:31:55.591 --> 01:31:56.210
just an,

1665
01:31:56.210 --> 01:32:00.130
I don't feel like the same vibe when I listen to music today just doesn't sound

1666
01:32:00.131 --> 01:32:03.610
the same.
I saw John Fogarty jogging the other day on Mulholland.
Whoa.

1667
01:32:03.850 --> 01:32:06.840
That was fucking cool.
And as soon as I passed him,

1668
01:32:06.841 --> 01:32:11.710
I put on CCS scream out bone on a by you.
I said,

1669
01:32:11.950 --> 01:32:16.000
I put,
I put on a on when have you ever seen the rain?
As soon as I passed them.

1670
01:32:16.600 --> 01:32:21.460
Didn't he get like some sort of a serious legal dispute like his former manager

1671
01:32:21.461 --> 01:32:26.070
and like crippled and financially I think he was in some big fucking throw down.

1672
01:32:26.080 --> 01:32:31.080
Like he made that song something can't dance but a steel yum on a watch him or

1673
01:32:31.301 --> 01:32:34.090
rob you blind.
He made a song about this Gal.

1674
01:32:34.120 --> 01:32:38.080
Was that why he was joking or not driving?
Yeah,
maybe man.

1675
01:32:38.560 --> 01:32:41.530
Yeah.
That's why he's not in CCR right there.
There they too are,

1676
01:32:41.531 --> 01:32:46.140
but there's a CCR.
It's Creedence Clearwater revisited.
Really?
Yup.

1677
01:32:46.180 --> 01:32:50.110
Oh,
that's ridiculous.
How could you have credence Clearwater revival route?

1678
01:32:50.140 --> 01:32:53.580
John [inaudible] well,
journey has a,

1679
01:32:53.581 --> 01:32:57.910
the Filipino guy who who's singing for um,
for,

1680
01:32:57.990 --> 01:33:01.660
where's the guy then the regular journey.
He's Perry.
Where's he?
He's like,

1681
01:33:01.690 --> 01:33:06.430
I think his voice is shot.
No Way.
Something happened to him with his voice.
Oh No.

1682
01:33:06.490 --> 01:33:09.160
So they've got this Filipino kid who was in a journey cover band in the

1683
01:33:09.161 --> 01:33:13.960
Philippines and they heard him and he sounds exactly like Steve Perry.
No.

1684
01:33:13.961 --> 01:33:15.130
Well it's pretty fucking his name.

1685
01:33:15.131 --> 01:33:19.000
Is Arnold something that you think we could play that on the podcast?
Why not?

1686
01:33:19.590 --> 01:33:23.890
You can't cast anymore to Sirius radio,

1687
01:33:24.130 --> 01:33:26.920
satellite radio now.
So we have to watch it.
We don't get sued.

1688
01:33:27.280 --> 01:33:29.950
This is how ridiculous they are.
We got to get our own insurance

1689
01:33:30.710 --> 01:33:32.240
<v 8>and we can't play music.</v>

1690
01:33:32.890 --> 01:33:36.740
<v 4>Yeah,
that sucks.
Cause all the freedoms we have in America though.</v>

1691
01:33:36.790 --> 01:33:38.950
But I wanted to,
especially with you on,

1692
01:33:38.951 --> 01:33:42.130
I wanted to play some music cause the last time we were walking we played some

1693
01:33:42.131 --> 01:33:46.680
fucking riff and he picked out some beats in this song that we had to go,
what?

1694
01:33:46.700 --> 01:33:50.530
We had to like that platform and we got to go CSI on this fucking thing to try

1695
01:33:50.550 --> 01:33:54.120
to hear what you picked up like instinctually.

1696
01:33:54.340 --> 01:33:58.340
<v 8>And that was,
I can hear those stupid sounds even with low bit rate,</v>

1697
01:33:58.400 --> 01:34:01.670
low bit rate and I can hear it.
I'm trying to find this John Fogle to thing,

1698
01:34:01.671 --> 01:34:05.600
but I can't find the,
the legal troubles and looking forward on his,
uh,

1699
01:34:06.050 --> 01:34:10.280
his Wikipedia.
But it was a,

1700
01:34:10.910 --> 01:34:14.900
I know he made that song about the guy,
you know,
something about something.

1701
01:34:14.901 --> 01:34:19.850
Can't dance or it's still your money.
What are you doing there fellow?

1702
01:34:20.090 --> 01:34:20.660
I was,
go ahead.

1703
01:34:20.660 --> 01:34:23.750
<v 4>I think of a song if it's CFA.
Russ was ever heard this,</v>

1704
01:34:23.840 --> 01:34:25.310
but you can't play music young file.

1705
01:34:25.311 --> 01:34:28.130
I'm just going to say what the name of this can we hollow?

1706
01:34:28.290 --> 01:34:31.130
It's okay to play music if it's yours.
I see what's going on here.

1707
01:34:31.640 --> 01:34:35.900
Why I oughta major lazer.
How great is the major Lazer?
Major Lazer?
Yeah,

1708
01:34:36.550 --> 01:34:38.840
Dave really redoing the three stooges,

1709
01:34:38.960 --> 01:34:41.180
cause I keep telling her that they're redoing the three stooges.

1710
01:34:41.181 --> 01:34:45.780
I heard that on the TV movies.
She isn't Steve Sort of,
uh,

1711
01:34:45.820 --> 01:34:47.990
I think of Steve corrals playing one of them too.

1712
01:34:49.190 --> 01:34:53.730
<v 8>Wow.
No fucking way.
That seems like a terrible idea,
doesn't it?</v>

1713
01:34:53.930 --> 01:34:57.590
He might even be playing Mo.
I don't think you,
no,
no.

1714
01:34:58.400 --> 01:34:59.900
<v 5>You have to say no.
If someone wants to,</v>

1715
01:34:59.901 --> 01:35:02.960
Justin Timberlake was booboo and the Yogi bear movie.

1716
01:35:04.590 --> 01:35:05.423
<v 4>What?</v>

1717
01:35:05.550 --> 01:35:07.420
<v 5>That Yogi bear movie that came out recently,
right?</v>

1718
01:35:07.470 --> 01:35:11.470
<v 4>Wasn't Yogi bear after Timberlake,
uh,</v>

1719
01:35:12.200 --> 01:35:13.280
animated thing.

1720
01:35:13.440 --> 01:35:14.940
<v 5>Yeah.
It's a classic movie though,</v>

1721
01:35:15.060 --> 01:35:17.610
or classic character that's now Justin Timberlake.

1722
01:35:17.670 --> 01:35:19.560
<v 4>Yeah,
but it's not because it's a voice.</v>

1723
01:35:19.980 --> 01:35:24.450
It's not like he's playing Larry or curly or mo or even shrimp.

1724
01:35:24.830 --> 01:35:27.510
Sham.
I liked champ Schempp didn't get any credit.

1725
01:35:27.511 --> 01:35:31.530
It was a Marx brother's got a fairly brothers movie.
Is it?
Yep.
There you go.

1726
01:35:31.740 --> 01:35:35.570
Who's playing it?
Does it say Sophie Vergara?
Sofia Vergara.

1727
01:35:35.980 --> 01:35:39.400
I did a movie with her son.
How hot is that bitch and

1728
01:35:43.320 --> 01:35:46.860
girls that just have that look man,
that they put on the unit.

1729
01:35:47.020 --> 01:35:50.970
The cool thing about her is she's cool as shit.
Wow.
Wow.

1730
01:35:51.360 --> 01:35:52.350
Do you live the about Kleenex?

1731
01:35:52.351 --> 01:35:55.500
I've gone through because she doesn't have to be that cool.
Did you talk to,

1732
01:35:55.560 --> 01:35:58.890
I have to be aggravating.
You can be a little cunty and it's tolerable.

1733
01:35:59.040 --> 01:36:02.370
No country there.
Hot as fuck.
God.
She talking too shabby.

1734
01:36:02.490 --> 01:36:04.980
She's so high that it makes you uncomfortable.
Like you're looking at it.

1735
01:36:04.980 --> 01:36:09.330
You just go over for food.
We were supposed to have a kissing scene and whoa.

1736
01:36:09.540 --> 01:36:13.260
And then the uh,
director posers,
I guess.
Sorry Sophia didn't sign for that.

1737
01:36:13.300 --> 01:36:18.140
I'm like,
Oh shit,
son.
She wouldn't sign for a slow dancing scene instead,

1738
01:36:18.540 --> 01:36:22.740
or that's okay.
She's so printing and it isn't she like 42?
Yeah.
She's nerdy guy.

1739
01:36:23.210 --> 01:36:25.770
Yeah,
it's time I saw her.
She was in an episode of entourage.

1740
01:36:27.720 --> 01:36:32.220
God pushy when they first went down to start doing medean.

1741
01:36:32.370 --> 01:36:37.290
Ah,
she came into and then the Billy Walsh falls in love with her and then,

1742
01:36:37.800 --> 01:36:40.960
um,
it turns out that vent fuck through and all that kind of,
whoa.

1743
01:36:41.070 --> 01:36:44.760
I don't remember that.
Yeah.
Fuck yeah.
And entourage entourage.

1744
01:36:44.761 --> 01:36:49.270
That movie's getting show is getting more and more unrealistic every year.
Right.

1745
01:36:49.480 --> 01:36:52.670
Can you imagine that?
That's where I,
yeah,
and then we have Vince fucker.
Yeah.

1746
01:36:52.700 --> 01:36:55.010
Put that in there and then he becomes a werewolf.
Yeah.

1747
01:36:55.670 --> 01:36:58.590
Then unicorns coming out of the carpet.
She was in brothers.

1748
01:36:59.160 --> 01:37:02.760
What does that does it the Marky mark movie?
Yeah,
with Marky Mark Tyrese.

1749
01:37:04.050 --> 01:37:06.990
Tyrese tweets who were too much.
I had to shut them off.

1750
01:37:07.340 --> 01:37:11.300
I had an we're following Tyrese.
Oh yeah.
Beautiful.
And inspirational trees.

1751
01:37:11.860 --> 01:37:15.110
This is a weird way to find out your cage.
Inspirational tweets.

1752
01:37:15.590 --> 01:37:18.050
They love when people reverend run.
I follow him.

1753
01:37:18.270 --> 01:37:21.500
I love really condescending,

1754
01:37:21.501 --> 01:37:25.640
inspirational tweets that a lot of guys will do to women.
Like ladies,

1755
01:37:25.820 --> 01:37:29.630
you need to look out for yourself and be strong.
You know,

1756
01:37:29.631 --> 01:37:34.310
if that man can love you for who you are,
he can't love you.
Period.
Capitalize.

1757
01:37:34.440 --> 01:37:38.990
Period.
There's something about that sort of like cheesy,

1758
01:37:38.991 --> 01:37:42.830
low level pimping.
It's low level pimping and it makes me laugh.

1759
01:37:44.600 --> 01:37:47.510
Comedy shows as well.
When the guy goes,
okay,
come on,

1760
01:37:47.511 --> 01:37:49.310
put your hands together for all the beautiful ladies here.

1761
01:37:49.750 --> 01:37:52.400
It's about three attractive woman in the entire room.

1762
01:37:52.490 --> 01:37:56.610
Every time I do a black room,
I always hear where the independent get your,

1763
01:37:57.090 --> 01:37:59.670
if you're independent you should be at fucking doing something independent,

1764
01:37:59.671 --> 01:38:04.290
not watching a comedy show.
How come nobody looks for the freeloading bitches?

1765
01:38:04.340 --> 01:38:06.660
Are they with the free loading bitches?

1766
01:38:07.820 --> 01:38:10.280
Well that was one of the beautiful things about the Kanye West Song.

1767
01:38:10.281 --> 01:38:14.030
I ain't seen she's a gold digger.
This,
uh,

1768
01:38:14.160 --> 01:38:16.880
there's a a certain amount of people that just,
uh,

1769
01:38:17.990 --> 01:38:21.890
they just know yeah.
Or they are follow 50 cent on Twitter sometimes.

1770
01:38:21.891 --> 01:38:25.460
His Shit's funny.
Yeah.
He says some funny shit.
He talks a lot of shit too.
Yeah.

1771
01:38:25.730 --> 01:38:29.030
Yeah.
He's,
he's seems like he's having a good time.

1772
01:38:29.990 --> 01:38:32.780
I don't think he takes himself too seriously and I think he realizes he's

1773
01:38:32.781 --> 01:38:33.501
fucking lucky.

1774
01:38:33.501 --> 01:38:37.550
Shit is making a ton of money off that fight him and water more than anything

1775
01:38:37.551 --> 01:38:41.630
isn't that 400 million off of sane amount of money retired.

1776
01:38:42.300 --> 01:38:46.100
He asked for a piece of vitamin water when he was like promoting them and then

1777
01:38:46.101 --> 01:38:51.020
it became this sheet Uhg fucking company.
Well,
now he's got a chunk of it.

1778
01:38:51.170 --> 01:38:54.230
Wow.
There's things like that.
I mean,

1779
01:38:54.231 --> 01:38:57.020
all you have to do is just call water vitamin water and people are like,
oh,

1780
01:38:57.850 --> 01:39:01.930
they're just so stupid.
They're just,
it sounds like it's good for you.
Yeah.

1781
01:39:02.260 --> 01:39:07.130
It's just,
it sounds like it's good for you.
No,
we're doing it with our tweeting,

1782
01:39:07.470 --> 01:39:11.200
checking it.
We can end this.
If it's boring the fuck out.

1783
01:39:13.400 --> 01:39:15.590
I don't want you to,
you know,
I'm just checking for you buddy.

1784
01:39:15.800 --> 01:39:19.250
Checking to make sure everything's Okay and making sure the world is moving at a

1785
01:39:19.251 --> 01:39:22.540
nice pace.
Is Everything okay out there?
Um,

1786
01:39:22.760 --> 01:39:25.760
it's looking like it India and Pakistan.
Are they going to go to war?
You tell me.

1787
01:39:25.761 --> 01:39:28.940
Do you have the inside skinny?
Um,
you know,

1788
01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.770
that's what's going to happen after the cricket,
cricket,

1789
01:39:32.570 --> 01:39:35.240
cricket match against each other.
They played each other in the,
in India,

1790
01:39:35.241 --> 01:39:40.190
one by one.
Cricket in the World Cup.
How important is cricket to you guys?
To me,

1791
01:39:40.210 --> 01:39:44.540
not personally,
but in India it is the biggest thing.

1792
01:39:44.541 --> 01:39:47.900
And that's their super bowl dude.
Yeah,
huge.
I mean,

1793
01:39:47.901 --> 01:39:49.830
we're not as known as athletes.
What's,
let's face it.

1794
01:39:49.890 --> 01:39:54.210
You have some great wrestlers.
Do you have a great history of wrestlers?
We do.
Um,

1795
01:39:54.810 --> 01:39:59.640
but however,
um,
subsequently wrestling training too,
you know,
and like,

1796
01:39:59.690 --> 01:40:03.650
I didn't a martial arts start in India originally.
Who knows where it started.

1797
01:40:03.770 --> 01:40:08.030
You know,
there's,
there's a bunch of different started in Asia,
most likely.

1798
01:40:08.390 --> 01:40:11.150
But you know,
there's also speculation.
It might have started in Africa too.

1799
01:40:11.840 --> 01:40:14.690
What else?
Nobody really knows Zelle down to the ground.

1800
01:40:14.750 --> 01:40:16.070
But if you go back in time,
you know,

1801
01:40:16.071 --> 01:40:20.150
the Japan is probably the place where the most damage was done,
where the most,

1802
01:40:20.151 --> 01:40:22.100
uh,
shit was figured out.
But you know,

1803
01:40:22.101 --> 01:40:25.010
martial arts in the year 2011 or stronger than they've ever been.

1804
01:40:25.220 --> 01:40:29.780
We know more about martial arts in 2011 than anybody ever has for sure by a long

1805
01:40:29.781 --> 01:40:32.990
shot.
The,
the martial artists have just two decades ago,

1806
01:40:32.991 --> 01:40:36.530
can't fuck with the martial arts stuff today.
And I was no,
no comparison.

1807
01:40:36.560 --> 01:40:39.560
And there's never been anything like that before where something has evolved so

1808
01:40:39.561 --> 01:40:41.770
quickly and dramatically in our lifetime.
Yeah.

1809
01:40:41.840 --> 01:40:44.660
Martial arts is basically the automobiles of,

1810
01:40:45.280 --> 01:40:48.890
I mean the way it evolve know technology and the way that people figured shit

1811
01:40:48.891 --> 01:40:52.130
out better.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Similar.
But it's weird,
you know,

1812
01:40:52.280 --> 01:40:54.010
unlike computers,

1813
01:40:54.010 --> 01:40:55.960
<v 0>basically it's been around for thousands of years,</v>

1814
01:40:56.140 --> 01:40:58.000
but for thousands of years when you fought,

1815
01:40:58.270 --> 01:41:02.160
we didn't have the luxury of fighting for sport.
You know,

1816
01:41:02.170 --> 01:41:04.480
when you fought it was cause you were fucking try.
Yeah.

1817
01:41:04.481 --> 01:41:07.270
You're trying to stay alive for thousands and thousands of years,

1818
01:41:07.360 --> 01:41:09.280
so you didn't have the fucking,

1819
01:41:09.310 --> 01:41:14.100
the time to be training twice a day and taking taekwondo and you know,
and,
and,

1820
01:41:14.101 --> 01:41:16.570
and,
you know,
learning Jujitsu and Rio.

1821
01:41:16.571 --> 01:41:20.620
And I think the shift that people are going to taekwondo or karate or some shit.

1822
01:41:20.621 --> 01:41:22.590
Yeah.
Bruce puffers got a black belt in taekwondo.

1823
01:41:22.710 --> 01:41:24.720
<v 5>I'm throwing some quick.
Jesus Christ.</v>

1824
01:41:24.780 --> 01:41:28.140
<v 0>You fucks.
This is what I get for Nada.</v>

1825
01:41:29.150 --> 01:41:31.550
<v 5>You guys hear what Roger Ebert said about that guy,</v>

1826
01:41:31.551 --> 01:41:36.230
that jackass guy that does he say,
he said something like,
uh,
don't want friends.

1827
01:41:36.231 --> 01:41:40.990
Don't let Jack asses drive drunk or something like that.
Did he really say that?

1828
01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:44.240
Yeah.
And then Bam said like,
look,
I've been crying all day.
You know,

1829
01:41:44.241 --> 01:41:47.030
how dare you say something like this?
Fuck you

1830
01:41:47.450 --> 01:41:48.620
<v 0>apologize.
Will,
you know,</v>

1831
01:41:48.621 --> 01:41:52.030
it'd been just dropped from Michelle or [inaudible] book dropped his profile.

1832
01:41:52.240 --> 01:41:57.060
Roger Ebert or they pulled his profile,
but then they put it back up.
Um,
you know,

1833
01:41:57.100 --> 01:42:01.210
I guess the cracked under pressure and then they,
the one with the,
uh,
no jaw.

1834
01:42:01.360 --> 01:42:04.440
Yeah.
This is Joe removed from cancer.
You know,
it's,

1835
01:42:04.441 --> 01:42:08.560
it's a fucked up thing when someone dies that way.
But you have to also say,
hey,

1836
01:42:08.561 --> 01:42:09.280
you know,
you,
you,

1837
01:42:09.280 --> 01:42:12.460
we have to let people know that you're not supposed to be fucking driving trunk.

1838
01:42:12.730 --> 01:42:13.301
So you know,

1839
01:42:13.301 --> 01:42:17.200
your friend dying right now is the time to have the most impact on people

1840
01:42:17.201 --> 01:42:21.070
possible from a news event and for people to step out and say,
yeah,
hey,

1841
01:42:21.160 --> 01:42:23.980
you shouldn't be fucking driving drunk cause you don't just kill yourself.

1842
01:42:23.981 --> 01:42:27.460
You fuck kill a bunch of other people.
And you know,

1843
01:42:27.461 --> 01:42:29.980
and who knows who was driving.
He might've been the other guy that was driving,

1844
01:42:30.190 --> 01:42:34.210
but I understand that this dude's friend died and he's crushed and he's hurting.

1845
01:42:34.211 --> 01:42:37.210
He's crying all day.
But it doesn't negate the situation.

1846
01:42:37.211 --> 01:42:39.280
It doesn't mean as a human being,

1847
01:42:39.281 --> 01:42:43.060
I think we have an obligation when someone dies in a fucked up way as a comic

1848
01:42:43.061 --> 01:42:45.610
especially,
we have an obligation to talk about that shit.

1849
01:42:45.950 --> 01:42:49.900
We've got to flip it on its head.
Yeah,
you have to.
And as a society,

1850
01:42:50.080 --> 01:42:52.000
even though I'm not a big fan of critics,

1851
01:42:52.150 --> 01:42:55.090
I'm not a big fan of like the shit that Roger Uber does for the most part

1852
01:42:55.091 --> 01:42:59.080
because I think most of what they do is just negative,
snarky bullshit,
you know?

1853
01:42:59.081 --> 01:43:03.550
I think they have an obligation to step up and to say something about,

1854
01:43:03.730 --> 01:43:07.780
about a situation that they feel strongly about like that.
That's a big issue,

1855
01:43:07.781 --> 01:43:12.520
man.
Yeah.
You know,
I see.
I know what Bam saying,
but you got to,

1856
01:43:12.521 --> 01:43:15.190
if that was my friend and my friend died drinking and driving,
I would go,

1857
01:43:15.191 --> 01:43:17.980
you're right.
You shouldn't drink and drive,
man.
You shouldn't.
This is fucked up.

1858
01:43:17.981 --> 01:43:20.470
It's crazy.
I lost my friends more fucked up.
Is that a,

1859
01:43:20.740 --> 01:43:24.460
Brian was more upset about Red Ben.
I mean Ryan Dunn Dying.

1860
01:43:24.461 --> 01:43:27.000
Then his cousin who got run over six months time now.

1861
01:43:28.010 --> 01:43:31.720
No devastated or sad about Ryan Dell.

1862
01:43:32.940 --> 01:43:37.200
<v 5>I had to stop thinking about it.
It's,
it's like I never met her and you know,</v>

1863
01:43:37.201 --> 01:43:41.000
my niece,
it's my,
like Stephanie's.
Anyways,
it's,
it's it.
But,
you know,

1864
01:43:41.001 --> 01:43:44.910
I don't hang out with my niece ever,
you know,
except on holidays.

1865
01:43:45.180 --> 01:43:48.630
But it's just more so it's to me,
it's kind of like,
it's more outside.

1866
01:43:48.631 --> 01:43:52.280
Like I don't know these people that well and it just kind of disturbs

1867
01:43:52.280 --> 01:43:55.320
<v 0>me.
I keep on thinking about it.
I don't even think,
think about it now,
you know,</v>

1868
01:43:55.660 --> 01:44:00.300
<v 10>brought it back home.
[inaudible] Jackass Guy.</v>

1869
01:44:00.330 --> 01:44:03.900
The time a big rehash or something about those jackass guys

1870
01:44:03.980 --> 01:44:08.310
<v 0>dying outside of a jackass stunt that seems like almost like,
you know,</v>

1871
01:44:08.480 --> 01:44:11.840
how the fuck did that happen?
It almost seems unfair.

1872
01:44:12.140 --> 01:44:14.620
Well it's Kinda like when Steve Irwin died from us thing,
ray,

1873
01:44:15.140 --> 01:44:18.110
well it's still fucking around with animals.
You know,

1874
01:44:18.350 --> 01:44:21.830
I got a lot of people got mad at me cause after Steve Irwin.
Dot.
I said,
uh,

1875
01:44:22.130 --> 01:44:25.430
what did I say?
I said,
I go,
uh,
the world loses one.

1876
01:44:25.431 --> 01:44:29.600
That wacky animal guy in my act gains 10 minutes.
I don't really see the loss.

1877
01:44:29.980 --> 01:44:32.400
It's really a Douche bag thing to say.
Uh,

1878
01:44:32.500 --> 01:44:34.460
and I didn't think about it cause then I thought about it afterwards.
I'm like,

1879
01:44:34.600 --> 01:44:37.370
Oh,
this guy's got kids and he's got a family.
And what if they saw that?

1880
01:44:37.610 --> 01:44:41.520
And so I actually,
uh,
I,
I put a,
it was all just a post I've made him,

1881
01:44:41.521 --> 01:44:44.930
my message board actually took it down and then I wrote something based on like

1882
01:44:44.931 --> 01:44:49.400
how I really felt about the guy.
But what I really fail feel like in,

1883
01:44:49.410 --> 01:44:50.300
in a situation like that,

1884
01:44:50.301 --> 01:44:54.500
it's like you Kinda have to make fun of the situation because that guy was doing

1885
01:44:54.501 --> 01:44:56.690
something that we know you're not supposed to do.

1886
01:44:56.870 --> 01:45:00.890
He was running up to animals and fucking around with them and pythons and cobras

1887
01:45:00.891 --> 01:45:02.330
and lions and the,

1888
01:45:02.331 --> 01:45:06.890
the most fucked up dangerous animals on the planet and his Gig was that he would

1889
01:45:06.891 --> 01:45:10.070
feed crocodiles while he was holding his baby.
Do you remember that shit?

1890
01:45:11.420 --> 01:45:14.840
You,
Jesus,
you think,
think you get,
you mean,

1891
01:45:15.050 --> 01:45:17.450
we know he wasn't completely in control.

1892
01:45:17.451 --> 01:45:20.180
He fucking died at the hands of an animal,
you know,

1893
01:45:20.181 --> 01:45:24.620
but his shtick was that he would put himself in extreme danger.

1894
01:45:24.621 --> 01:45:28.010
What would make you incredibly uncomfortable and you know you're supposed to

1895
01:45:28.011 --> 01:45:30.860
like what?
When the guy dies,
you're not supposed to say anything.

1896
01:45:30.861 --> 01:45:34.310
You're supposed to be quiet.
No,
you're really supposed to make fun of them.
Yeah,

1897
01:45:34.311 --> 01:45:36.620
you fuck.
You're not supposed to do that.
God Damn it.

1898
01:45:36.621 --> 01:45:40.100
You're not supposed to be feeding crocodiles while you're holding a baby,

1899
01:45:40.220 --> 01:45:42.650
but you know how the crocodiles going to move you.
Fuck.

1900
01:45:42.890 --> 01:45:46.160
That's craziness and it's his own bay.
Oh Man.

1901
01:45:46.190 --> 01:45:48.710
Is it true that bringing back fear factor to bring in my favor?

1902
01:45:49.120 --> 01:45:52.450
<v 10>Congratulations.
We're talking right now trying to get that done on paper,</v>

1903
01:45:52.451 --> 01:45:56.680
son words then.
I Dunno.
I can't be hosted by anybody else.

1904
01:45:56.850 --> 01:45:58.170
<v 0>We'll see maybe forest.</v>

1905
01:45:58.200 --> 01:46:02.520
Mario Lopez has an engaging smile in a way about him that makes you want to tune

1906
01:46:02.521 --> 01:46:05.220
in and maybe Mario could do it.
I don't know,
man.

1907
01:46:05.310 --> 01:46:09.000
I might do it because it's very possible.
I got to get that right by phone.

1908
01:46:09.090 --> 01:46:11.100
I'm just so busy too right now with the UFC,

1909
01:46:11.101 --> 01:46:13.830
but if they comment that it on paper,
we'll see what's up.

1910
01:46:14.430 --> 01:46:16.530
I least give Joe Rogan some long paper.

1911
01:46:17.520 --> 01:46:21.450
I'm only in this game for one reason.
Kids on paper have you seen me?

1912
01:46:21.900 --> 01:46:24.690
Premiers with fur coats on and giant pimp habits.
You know what's up

1913
01:46:24.880 --> 01:46:27.100
<v 10>and a lot of Mondays all around your arm.
One day,</v>

1914
01:46:28.910 --> 01:46:31.000
I remember when we were in,

1915
01:46:31.100 --> 01:46:35.730
<v 0>uh,
Georgia and this girl was calling black people elements,
elements,</v>

1916
01:46:37.500 --> 01:46:38.860
elements.
We were in a,

1917
01:46:38.970 --> 01:46:42.720
we were in Georgia and we were asked to the show we were going to leave and we

1918
01:46:42.721 --> 01:46:47.220
said,
hey,
is there a good place to get something to eat around here are good bar.

1919
01:46:47.370 --> 01:46:50.310
What's,
where's the place to go?
She,
well this place

1920
01:46:50.310 --> 01:46:51.091
<v 4>is okay.</v>

1921
01:46:51.091 --> 01:46:56.091
But well they got the elements there and we were like the what the elements are

1922
01:46:57.031 --> 01:46:59.250
there.
The elements like,
you know,

1923
01:46:59.251 --> 01:47:04.200
like Pete was like fucking fire tornadoes.
When you got earthquakes,

1924
01:47:04.240 --> 01:47:09.240
you got you to get together and produce a glossary natural of shit that people

1925
01:47:09.901 --> 01:47:14.100
cook.
Black people be where white people were figured out.
Oh,
another word.

1926
01:47:14.101 --> 01:47:17.850
Other than nigger.
Exactly.
The eye.
The eye nick for the Iphone,

1927
01:47:17.851 --> 01:47:22.830
you can have your name.
Yeah.
Well that's,
I bet that would be offensive to people.

1928
01:47:24.040 --> 01:47:28.960
That's right.
Junior high,
my Negro.
That would be,
yeah,

1929
01:47:28.970 --> 01:47:30.720
but isn't that offensive to people?

1930
01:47:30.721 --> 01:47:32.940
Like there's a lot of people that are going to think that calling someone a

1931
01:47:32.941 --> 01:47:36.620
Monday it's going to be offensive because it cause it Tuesdays.

1932
01:47:36.740 --> 01:47:39.600
Cause the distinction is that the black,
I think white people are Tuesday.

1933
01:47:42.060 --> 01:47:45.510
I think Tuesday would be Asians for some reason.
There's Day.
Yeah.

1934
01:47:45.660 --> 01:47:49.620
Has a yellow hue to,
it sounds to me like Tuesday would be the Asian.

1935
01:47:50.460 --> 01:47:52.230
Oh Geez.

1936
01:47:54.450 --> 01:47:56.340
There's a group that's shy on comedians.

1937
01:47:56.550 --> 01:47:58.860
I mean they're starting to pick up the pace over the past decade or so,

1938
01:47:58.861 --> 01:48:03.270
but the Asian could we get Johnny [inaudible] who's the dude?

1939
01:48:03.300 --> 01:48:05.490
Henry Cho that talks,
showed a southern guy.

1940
01:48:05.491 --> 01:48:08.910
He's still rock that southern accent when he,
that's only he,
it his real voice.

1941
01:48:08.911 --> 01:48:12.520
That's really how he talks his Margaret Cho still still performing.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1942
01:48:12.570 --> 01:48:15.570
She's still around.
She's still around.
I believe she almost fucked Ari.

1943
01:48:15.571 --> 01:48:20.100
Shaffir whoa.
Really?
Yeah.
Or should fear was gonna they were gonna throw down.

1944
01:48:21.360 --> 01:48:24.400
Literally might not be supposed to be talking about this in the podcast.

1945
01:48:25.770 --> 01:48:28.280
I love Margaret though.
She knows a lot.
It was a culture.
Hey,

1946
01:48:28.290 --> 01:48:31.830
is that the beaver we got that chewed up on your IMD be there at the beaver.

1947
01:48:31.831 --> 01:48:34.940
Is that a real movie that Mel Gibson movie?
It's really coming out.

1948
01:48:34.970 --> 01:48:37.050
It's supposedly isn't it?
And it flopped.

1949
01:48:37.450 --> 01:48:42.190
<v 5>Yeah.
It came out.
It opened up in Germany,
I believe.
Yeah,</v>

1950
01:48:42.220 --> 01:48:46.770
Germany opened up May 19th and that's,

1951
01:48:47.200 --> 01:48:47.880
I don't think it should,

1952
01:48:47.880 --> 01:48:50.400
<v 4>it has an open in America and what's,</v>

1953
01:48:50.420 --> 01:48:52.080
I mean if you're going to say antisemetic Marsha,

1954
01:48:52.100 --> 01:48:56.360
might as well open up in Germany.
Test the waters.
Yeah,
no shit.

1955
01:48:56.361 --> 01:48:59.000
If that really opens up Germany,
that's hilarious.
Wow.

1956
01:48:59.170 --> 01:49:02.420
Do you know how funny then is if his movie really opened up in Germany?
No.

1957
01:49:02.450 --> 01:49:04.070
It looks on,
see the problem.

1958
01:49:04.100 --> 01:49:07.610
<v 5>It looks like I'd open up everywhere,
but it only opened up like total,</v>

1959
01:49:07.611 --> 01:49:11.060
like 22 screens and then it,
oh,
then it went to 168 screens.

1960
01:49:11.090 --> 01:49:14.540
Nobody wants to see it,
Huh?
Yeah.
It's definitely low budget movie.

1961
01:49:14.720 --> 01:49:17.630
<v 4>I don't think it's a low budget.
We lead all,
it's Jodie foster and Mel Gibson.</v>

1962
01:49:17.840 --> 01:49:19.810
It was just 19 million.
No,
it was,

1963
01:49:21.920 --> 01:49:24.530
it was made right when I'm the shit.

1964
01:49:24.620 --> 01:49:28.010
It was done right when the shit went down with him and all those audio

1965
01:49:28.011 --> 01:49:30.800
recordings and then there were,
they sat on it for a minute.
Yeah.

1966
01:49:30.801 --> 01:49:33.470
They sat on it for like a year,
right?
At least.
Right?

1967
01:49:33.810 --> 01:49:38.580
<v 5>Yeah.
I don't know.
So this is a movie that he,
he,
does he have a puppet act or it,</v>

1968
01:49:38.690 --> 01:49:43.020
<v 4>you can pop it that that talks for him because he's fucking crazy and he's</v>

1969
01:49:43.021 --> 01:49:43.831
ruining his life.

1970
01:49:43.831 --> 01:49:47.900
So he uses this puppet sorta pick up the pieces and get his life in order.

1971
01:49:48.160 --> 01:49:52.750
Is it like a remake of magic,
the acne help cubes movie from the,
well,

1972
01:49:52.751 --> 01:49:57.610
he was a ventriloquist and knee.
The dummy kind of took over.
Oh No.

1973
01:49:57.611 --> 01:50:01.300
I think that was when the dummy one wind up killing people and shit.
No,

1974
01:50:01.301 --> 01:50:05.730
that was way more fun.
Yeah.
This is,
this is a pet beaver.
It's like,
yeah,

1975
01:50:05.740 --> 01:50:09.970
it's like a,
a puppet that is meant to be,
that talks about his children in it.

1976
01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:12.790
Yeah.
What would I be able to speak to them through the beaver?

1977
01:50:12.910 --> 01:50:16.850
<v 10>I like.
What is that?
You know</v>

1978
01:50:18.170 --> 01:50:22.160
<v 2>I won my daughter's back by speaking to them through the beaver who was in the</v>

1979
01:50:22.161 --> 01:50:26.540
room.
I got,
she got green.
You've got to pee again.
Let's just wrap this bitch up.

1980
01:50:26.541 --> 01:50:30.260
It's fine.
Look what they said that they said,
that Jackass Guy,

1981
01:50:30.290 --> 01:50:33.820
he crashed going 130 miles per hour.
Oh,

1982
01:50:33.840 --> 01:50:38.350
wasn't he driving a Porsche nine one one if I remember.
Wow.
Jesus Christ there.

1983
01:50:38.840 --> 01:50:43.250
<v 4>130 miles an hour.
I don't drink.
I've never drank.</v>

1984
01:50:43.251 --> 01:50:46.700
But what goes through your mind when you're thinking to self that,
okay,

1985
01:50:46.701 --> 01:50:50.690
I'll been,
you could do anything.
The problem is when you're drunk,

1986
01:50:50.990 --> 01:50:53.270
close that door.
We want to hear your purse,
motherfucker.

1987
01:50:56.890 --> 01:50:57.723
<v 10>Okay.</v>

1988
01:50:57.810 --> 01:51:00.090
<v 4>When you're a,
when you're drunk,
you're not thinking,</v>

1989
01:51:00.091 --> 01:51:02.790
and that's the whole idea that the beautiful thing about alcohol is it takes

1990
01:51:02.791 --> 01:51:06.570
away your inhibitions.
It takes away your ability to think that good too,
though.

1991
01:51:06.571 --> 01:51:09.030
It takes away everything Ebert's face.

1992
01:51:09.360 --> 01:51:14.100
Roger Ebert said that was probably too quick to tweet.
Mm.
Yeah,
he fucked up.

1993
01:51:14.160 --> 01:51:17.670
He said,
he said,
yeah.
I mean that guy is all negative,
man.

1994
01:51:18.290 --> 01:51:19.200
<v 2>Oh,
I would be too.</v>

1995
01:51:19.540 --> 01:51:23.690
I was watching that Stephen Hawkins movie or show on a Wifi network.

1996
01:51:23.691 --> 01:51:24.770
Have you watched any of that?

1997
01:51:24.800 --> 01:51:28.490
It's a where he kind of narrates the meaning of everything.

1998
01:51:28.520 --> 01:51:32.710
I think it's what it might be new.
Yeah.
What's it called?
Stephen Hawkin.

1999
01:51:32.711 --> 01:51:34.760
It's called Stephen Hawking's.

2000
01:51:34.790 --> 01:51:38.360
A guide to everything or something like that and all the writing it.

2001
01:51:38.620 --> 01:51:43.220
What was really Steven,
what,
what,
what does or doesn't say.

2002
01:51:43.221 --> 01:51:46.850
They have them out there and they'll have them like talking like this and then

2003
01:51:46.851 --> 01:51:50.810
like a narrator kind of blends into it so that his voice turns into a different

2004
01:51:50.811 --> 01:51:51.644
narrator.

2005
01:51:51.830 --> 01:51:56.060
Dude could easily be like the technological or futuristic Tupac.

2006
01:51:56.210 --> 01:51:59.970
We could keep his album's coming until the ever Stephen Hawking think going to

2007
01:51:59.980 --> 01:52:00.741
be long dead.

2008
01:52:00.741 --> 01:52:04.340
They could weekend at Bernie's that motherfucker and just keep coming out with

2009
01:52:04.341 --> 01:52:07.310
new audio books is Stephen Hawking.

2010
01:52:07.310 --> 01:52:10.460
And so new discoveries that I've found in my lap,

2011
01:52:10.580 --> 01:52:13.940
anybody want just speak and spelled correctly,
he's dead as fuck.

2012
01:52:14.020 --> 01:52:17.340
And I think that,
I think that Chafee Moga what's wrong saying that thing?

2013
01:52:17.480 --> 01:52:21.140
Wouldn't that be crazy if he's not saying shit and all these other physicists

2014
01:52:21.141 --> 01:52:22.980
are using him and it's like an inside joke.

2015
01:52:24.730 --> 01:52:28.290
They push him around and they control his little thing and they call them the

2016
01:52:29.060 --> 01:52:30.110
beaver and the beaver.

2017
01:52:30.320 --> 01:52:33.980
I think that you should fuck this guy over here that there was this a part

2018
01:52:33.981 --> 01:52:36.740
though where they,
he starts off talking about,
you know,
like gravity,

2019
01:52:36.741 --> 01:52:40.380
like how the tr uh,
apple falls from the tree and then like there were the,
the,

2020
01:52:40.520 --> 01:52:43.820
the guy that director was making it look like all these apples are flying all

2021
01:52:43.821 --> 01:52:46.220
around Steven hog and he's just there in his wheelchair.

2022
01:52:46.520 --> 01:52:48.680
And it's so funny because he can't move or anything.

2023
01:52:48.680 --> 01:52:52.670
So like there's this person behind him like throwing apples down behind them,

2024
01:52:52.671 --> 01:52:55.160
you know,
cause it's supposed to look like this tree is just dropping on Abbot.

2025
01:52:55.210 --> 01:52:59.360
I hope you get to see his little eyes like twitching.

2026
01:52:59.361 --> 01:53:04.200
Like what am I doing here?
These apples I really fast one.

2027
01:53:04.260 --> 01:53:06.320
If he could disagree with that.
If he has that in his contract,

2028
01:53:06.350 --> 01:53:09.140
I don't think this is the best way to get my point across.

2029
01:53:10.070 --> 01:53:14.870
One of these apples are going to help me imagine if the greatest minds of the

2030
01:53:14.870 --> 01:53:15.860
last decade dies by Apple.

2031
01:53:16.560 --> 01:53:19.970
They're doing a fucking stupid commercial and an apple fall on his horn to tell

2032
01:53:19.971 --> 01:53:22.300
him on the head he couldn't walk again.
What the fuck?

2033
01:53:24.900 --> 01:53:28.250
What did you guys do?
Because I'm feeling awesome.
That was great.

2034
01:53:28.280 --> 01:53:29.390
The issue spoke feeling.

2035
01:53:29.830 --> 01:53:33.800
If they fixed that guy who would just go on a pussy rampage just start fucking

2036
01:53:33.801 --> 01:53:36.500
everything.
Can you imagine if they came out some stem cell shit,

2037
01:53:36.501 --> 01:53:40.130
they shot it into him and all of a sudden he looks like a 30 year old athlete,

2038
01:53:40.450 --> 01:53:45.170
<v 8>which was for reversing blindness.
Yeah.
Isn't that insane?
Awesome.</v>

2039
01:53:45.240 --> 01:53:45.670
Yeah,

2040
01:53:45.670 --> 01:53:48.790
and meanwhile this is the shit that the Republicans tried to fight off during

2041
01:53:48.810 --> 01:53:52.690
the,
all the Bush administration tried to stop as much of a stem cell funding as

2042
01:53:52.691 --> 01:53:53.111
possible.

2043
01:53:53.111 --> 01:53:56.440
All this crazy Christian fundamentalists who thought that you're going to steal

2044
01:53:56.441 --> 01:54:01.441
babies and use their tissue and encourage abortions and people are having

2045
01:54:01.691 --> 01:54:03.220
abortions,
whether you like it or not,
hooker,

2046
01:54:04.060 --> 01:54:08.800
don't you think the baby would be far worse off in its state of existence if you

2047
01:54:08.801 --> 01:54:10.060
don't even do anything with the tissue.

2048
01:54:10.090 --> 01:54:13.750
But if you use the tissue abortion's a bad idea to go to Detroit Cha.

2049
01:54:15.880 --> 01:54:19.570
I think birth control,
birth control is certainly the best option.

2050
01:54:20.050 --> 01:54:22.420
Once you have kids,
man,
the idea of killing a baby,

2051
01:54:22.421 --> 01:54:25.900
even if it's only three cells inside your body,
it's kind of freaks you out.

2052
01:54:26.260 --> 01:54:26.531
You know?

2053
01:54:26.531 --> 01:54:29.810
Because like you realize if that kid got out of there and then you were raised

2054
01:54:29.811 --> 01:54:31.690
in it,
man,
you would love that fucking kid.

2055
01:54:31.870 --> 01:54:35.650
So the idea is sucking that kid up with a vacuum.
You know,
once you've had kids,

2056
01:54:35.920 --> 01:54:40.700
you know I'm a dad.
Yeah,
it's an intellectual sort of a debate.
And you know,
I,

2057
01:54:41.110 --> 01:54:43.090
I always say the other right to choose.
I say,

2058
01:54:43.091 --> 01:54:46.810
I cannot tell you what to do or what not to do with your body.

2059
01:54:46.811 --> 01:54:50.260
And if you want to suck those three cells out with a vacuum cleaner,

2060
01:54:50.261 --> 01:54:54.900
that's one thing.
But as a person who has kids in you,
you start realizing,
whoa,

2061
01:54:55.490 --> 01:55:00.310
three the fundamental idea behind it is there's a life inside of you.
I mean,

2062
01:55:00.311 --> 01:55:02.740
there really is a life.
I think you should be able to do whatever you want to do.

2063
01:55:02.741 --> 01:55:05.850
I'm not,
I'm not saying I'm right.
I'm not saying I'm trying to impose my,

2064
01:55:06.250 --> 01:55:10.150
but that life has been created and it's going to come out.
And when it comes out,

2065
01:55:10.151 --> 01:55:10.984
it's going to be a person.

2066
01:55:11.110 --> 01:55:15.790
And you could s headed off at the pass with some scientific trickery and suck

2067
01:55:15.791 --> 01:55:17.260
that little cat with a vacuum cleaner.

2068
01:55:17.261 --> 01:55:20.500
But you can't kill the debate as to what you're doing.
You know,

2069
01:55:20.530 --> 01:55:21.550
I'm not saying that I'm right,

2070
01:55:21.551 --> 01:55:25.930
but I'm saying there's a debate and there's a lot of like left wing people,

2071
01:55:25.931 --> 01:55:28.900
a lot of pro choice people who do,
do not want to approach that debate.

2072
01:55:28.901 --> 01:55:31.780
And they say,
no,
a woman has the right to choose.
I mean,
you're just,

2073
01:55:31.810 --> 01:55:34.360
you putting some words to a,
uh,

2074
01:55:34.530 --> 01:55:37.240
a situation and you're defining that situation by,

2075
01:55:37.241 --> 01:55:40.330
a woman's got a right to choose.
Oh,
she's got a right to choose to stuff,

2076
01:55:40.331 --> 01:55:43.470
a vacuum cleaner,
upper pussy and stuck out a baby kill it.

2077
01:55:43.471 --> 01:55:45.870
Is that what you're saying?
No,
that's not what we're saying,

2078
01:55:46.050 --> 01:55:48.840
but that's what's happening.
When the baby gets to be a certain age,

2079
01:55:48.960 --> 01:55:51.600
you're sucking that baby out of a pussy with a vacuum cleaner.

2080
01:55:51.810 --> 01:55:55.190
I'm not saying that I'm right.
Um,
but I am saying that,
you know,
no one,

2081
01:55:55.220 --> 01:55:57.840
they're not being really honest about what it is.
You know,

2082
01:55:57.841 --> 01:55:59.940
everybody wants the right to have an abortion.

2083
01:56:00.550 --> 01:56:03.820
<v 2>Can,
you know,
write your rape victims should definitely have,
fuck yeah,</v>

2084
01:56:03.821 --> 01:56:06.220
they should.
Rape Victims,
incest victim.

2085
01:56:06.230 --> 01:56:08.590
I'm not saying that there should be no reason for them to keep me,
dude.

2086
01:56:08.591 --> 01:56:10.540
I'm not saying that everybody shouldn't have the right,

2087
01:56:10.570 --> 01:56:14.240
I just say the deer is a debate and I don't think the debate has been completely

2088
01:56:14.241 --> 01:56:14.710
free.

2089
01:56:14.710 --> 01:56:19.000
<v 4>I think every woman from about,
you know,
who grew up in the,</v>

2090
01:56:19.030 --> 01:56:20.540
anywhere from the eighties onwards,

2091
01:56:21.520 --> 01:56:24.430
I think every chicken you've ever dated had an abortion at some point.

2092
01:56:24.790 --> 01:56:28.320
A lot of them have,
I would say 90% of the women out there have all had enough.

2093
01:56:28.650 --> 01:56:31.440
<v 2>Really.
You think it's that high?
I ain't get that.
Oh my God.</v>

2094
01:56:31.470 --> 01:56:35.760
Let's just say that many women have had an abortion.
Little bit.

2095
01:56:36.080 --> 01:56:39.440
<v 8>A lot of them had a,
I didn't go ahead an abortion.
I did it.</v>

2096
01:56:39.441 --> 01:56:42.770
A girl had an abortion.
I had a walker to the clinic.
It was fucking dark dude.

2097
01:56:42.800 --> 01:56:46.010
Cause there's all these women in front of the clinic and the have signs and
shit.

2098
01:56:46.400 --> 01:56:50.330
Same Shit.
And a lot of the signs are actually like,
like still birth babies,

2099
01:56:50.600 --> 01:56:53.570
you know,
it's like they're not even a aborted fetuses.
These,
these are like,

2100
01:56:53.571 --> 01:56:55.760
you know,
babies that died and you know,

2101
01:56:55.761 --> 01:56:58.680
and it came out of the body and they're just misrepresenting it in photos cause

2102
01:56:58.681 --> 01:57:00.500
they're ultra gruesome,
you know.

2103
01:57:00.501 --> 01:57:04.580
And then there's pictures of babies that the claim had been killed by abortion

2104
01:57:04.581 --> 01:57:05.151
vacuums.

2105
01:57:05.151 --> 01:57:08.180
They're all broken up and in pieces and they're sticking them in your feet.

2106
01:57:08.181 --> 01:57:11.780
Keep your baby,
keep your baby,
you know,
and they'll do that.
And there's,

2107
01:57:11.781 --> 01:57:15.590
there's situations where,
uh,
I know a guy who his wife was,
uh,
they,

2108
01:57:15.591 --> 01:57:19.730
the baby was still born inside of her and she had to go and get an abortion

2109
01:57:19.731 --> 01:57:21.900
because the baby was already dead inside of her and you know,

2110
01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:23.480
I could kill her and kill her.

2111
01:57:23.630 --> 01:57:27.650
And there were screaming all this shit at her as she was going into the clinic.

2112
01:57:27.651 --> 01:57:29.390
You're killing your baby,
you're killing your baby.

2113
01:57:29.690 --> 01:57:32.870
And the husband was fucking furious.
He was like,
you know,

2114
01:57:32.871 --> 01:57:36.410
my fucking babies already dead inside of her.
You can't get the fuck away,

2115
01:57:36.411 --> 01:57:38.420
like screaming and yelling.
And they're all,
and they,

2116
01:57:38.421 --> 01:57:41.270
they're claiming they're doing it for Jesus to which is the most hilarious.

2117
01:57:41.450 --> 01:57:45.630
<v 4>Yeah.
Fucking valet guy has nothing to do with it.
The Valet Guy,</v>

2118
01:57:46.250 --> 01:57:47.320
hey series together approximately.

2119
01:57:49.760 --> 01:57:53.740
<v 2>Oh,
Russell.
And I tell you,
I lighten it up a little bit at the end.</v>

2120
01:57:53.760 --> 01:57:56.890
I know we went down abortion boulevard,

2121
01:57:57.070 --> 01:57:59.050
we went down abortion board and parked in the mud.

2122
01:58:03.140 --> 01:58:04.990
It's a fucking dark subject.
They're going,

2123
01:58:04.991 --> 01:58:08.350
we should have bought that assumption quick too.
Good call,
good call.

2124
01:58:08.990 --> 01:58:12.130
<v 8>It is.
It is tricky and I'm not saying I'm anti abortion.</v>

2125
01:58:12.160 --> 01:58:14.920
You do whatever the fuck you want to do,
but I am saying it's weird.

2126
01:58:15.640 --> 01:58:16.473
<v 4>No</v>

2127
01:58:16.960 --> 01:58:19.250
<v 2>was really weird.
I think I talked about this before.</v>

2128
01:58:19.251 --> 01:58:23.150
I used to work at this restaurant in this eye,
this guy who worked there,

2129
01:58:23.480 --> 01:58:28.480
I used to always carry around pictures of his dead baby dressed up and close it.

2130
01:58:28.630 --> 01:58:33.440
Like it was born like premature,
like three after three months or something.

2131
01:58:33.441 --> 01:58:36.150
Like it was just like a really small baby.
Like it was not,

2132
01:58:36.170 --> 01:58:39.700
it didn't even look like most of a baby and they the kind of look like they died

2133
01:58:39.710 --> 01:58:40.543
and they dressed,

2134
01:58:40.550 --> 01:58:43.600
they dressed up in these clothes and they took pictures and I carried them

2135
01:58:43.601 --> 01:58:47.740
around in their wallets and they actually showed people as if it was alive
still.

2136
01:58:47.790 --> 01:58:49.710
And it was,
you know,
those people are assholes.

2137
01:58:49.730 --> 01:58:52.960
You're freaking people out on purpose.
You know what the fuck.
If you go online,

2138
01:58:52.961 --> 01:58:57.520
there's tons of websites where it's this like,
like different clothing.

2139
01:58:57.550 --> 01:58:58.061
Like the,

2140
01:58:58.061 --> 01:59:01.480
that people do like put different clothing and like make it like as if this

2141
01:59:01.481 --> 01:59:05.060
baby's still alive.
It's like they're honoring,

2142
01:59:05.860 --> 01:59:08.020
honoring it with different clothes that they have bought.

2143
01:59:08.030 --> 01:59:11.800
And that can be good mentally for it.
No,
I don't think it is either.

2144
01:59:11.801 --> 01:59:14.300
I don't think you have to have clothes.
You need to kind of say,
okay,
fine.

2145
01:59:14.480 --> 01:59:18.490
This closure,
it's fucked up.
You need to,
you know,
move on.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2146
01:59:18.491 --> 01:59:21.820
That's a weird thing man.
People are fucking strange if you've thought of it.

2147
01:59:21.821 --> 01:59:25.060
There's a community online dedicated to it.
Whether it's dressing up,

2148
01:59:25.061 --> 01:59:29.290
dead babies are,
or what the fuck ever speaking to communities online.
Peter's,

2149
01:59:29.410 --> 01:59:33.250
what's your website?
[inaudible] dot com two s's.
Two L's.

2150
01:59:34.240 --> 01:59:35.820
Sorry.
How can people reach you?
Uh,

2151
01:59:35.840 --> 01:59:39.370
I'm on Twitter at junior Simpson and also there's juniors,

Junior Sampson,
junior Simpson at junior,

2154
01:59:47.201 --> 01:59:49.030
which was for Twitter and a genesis and.com.

2155
01:59:49.200 --> 01:59:52.690
<v 0>Powerful.
Thank you for joining us guys.
It's been a lot of fun.
If somebody,</v>

2156
01:59:52.720 --> 01:59:54.720
when one,
can anybody see you do some stand up?

2157
01:59:54.900 --> 01:59:56.610
