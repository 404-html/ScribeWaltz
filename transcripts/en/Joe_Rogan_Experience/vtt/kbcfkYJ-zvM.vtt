00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:21.020
<v Speaker 1>Hey k a super hippie.</v>

8
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:22.880
<v Speaker 1>What's up?</v>

9
00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:23.540
<v Speaker 1>What's going on?</v>

10
00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:24.530
<v Speaker 1>What's going on my friend?</v>

11
00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:25.970
<v Speaker 1>What happened to the commercials?</v>

12
00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:26.300
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>

13
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:27.320
<v Speaker 1>fuck those things dude.</v>

<v Speaker 1>And those bitches in later.</v>

15
00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:29.990
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>

16
00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.090
<v Speaker 1>I realized somewhere along the line did,</v>

17
00:00:32.091 --> 00:00:34.340
<v Speaker 1>it's all about the flow of the conversation,</v>

18
00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.611
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

19
00:00:34.611 --> 00:00:36.620
<v Speaker 1>That's what makes a podcast interesting to me.</v>

20
00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.450
<v Speaker 1>If I'm listening to a cool podcast,</v>

21
00:00:38.451 --> 00:00:41.570
<v Speaker 1>I want the flow of the conversation be as natural as possible.</v>

22
00:00:41.571 --> 00:00:41.840
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

23
00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.810
<v Speaker 1>I think even starting with the music probably should stop to that.</v>

24
00:00:44.811 --> 00:00:46.280
<v Speaker 1>We'll add that shit and post.</v>

25
00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:47.210
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

26
00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:47.451
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

27
00:00:47.451 --> 00:00:51.050
<v Speaker 1>the flow of the conversation is what's up and the best way to get the flow of</v>

28
00:00:51.051 --> 00:00:52.250
<v Speaker 1>the conversation bright.</v>

29
00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:54.710
<v Speaker 1>It's just kind of get into it,</v>

30
00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:55.753
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

31
00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.451
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

32
00:00:56.451 --> 00:00:57.051
<v Speaker 1>I think that's right.</v>

33
00:00:57.051 --> 00:00:58.220
<v Speaker 1>I didn't mind commercials later.</v>

34
00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.410
<v Speaker 1>I just sit down with the people and start talking.</v>

35
00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:01.550
<v Speaker 1>If you do a commercial first,</v>

36
00:01:01.551 --> 00:01:04.880
<v Speaker 1>you've killed the vibe like for like five minutes more even.</v>

37
00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:05.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

38
00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.420
<v Speaker 1>I've been guests on people's shows where they do it too and I don't want to do</v>

39
00:01:08.421 --> 00:01:08.830
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

40
00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:09.021
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

41
00:01:09.021 --> 00:01:11.300
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to sit there with someone's reading off their commercials even if</v>

42
00:01:11.301 --> 00:01:12.040
<v Speaker 1>they're really good at it.</v>

43
00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:12.101
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

44
00:01:12.101 --> 00:01:12.531
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>

45
00:01:12.531 --> 00:01:12.801
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

46
00:01:12.801 --> 00:01:16.430
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's kind of the problem is that it forces you to do like I read read</v>

47
00:01:16.431 --> 00:01:19.010
<v Speaker 1>when someone's there because you want to get it done with and then that makes</v>

48
00:01:19.011 --> 00:01:23.090
<v Speaker 1>you sound like a robot and it's much more interesting to talk about the,</v>

49
00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:24.440
<v Speaker 1>if you're using it or not.</v>

50
00:01:24.441 --> 00:01:25.131
<v Speaker 1>Like what is it?</v>

51
00:01:25.131 --> 00:01:26.030
<v Speaker 1>Cause a lot of this stuff,</v>

52
00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:27.890
<v Speaker 1>a lot of the people are advertising on podcasts.</v>

53
00:01:27.891 --> 00:01:29.480
<v Speaker 1>It's some weird stuff man.</v>

54
00:01:29.481 --> 00:01:34.310
<v Speaker 1>It's like brand new strange technologies that are new.</v>

55
00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.821
<v Speaker 1>You know it's,</v>

56
00:01:34.821 --> 00:01:37.280
<v Speaker 1>it's all Internet based businesses in a lot of that.</v>

57
00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.800
<v Speaker 1>A lot of those are cool and Squarespace,</v>

58
00:01:39.801 --> 00:01:40.634
<v Speaker 1>that kind of stuff.</v>

59
00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:41.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

60
00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.810
<v Speaker 1>it's disruptive and it's very mild way like you find that that,</v>

61
00:01:44.811 --> 00:01:49.720
<v Speaker 1>that the staff is like disrupting the most annoying technologies.</v>

62
00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:54.730
<v Speaker 1>Like taxis got disrupted by Uber and if you consider like the experience of a</v>

63
00:01:54.891 --> 00:01:56.330
<v Speaker 1>taxi versus Uber,</v>

64
00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.430
<v Speaker 1>no offense to taxi drivers out there.</v>

65
00:01:58.431 --> 00:01:58.851
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry,</v>

66
00:01:58.851 --> 00:02:00.500
<v Speaker 1>you guys are a,</v>

67
00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.720
<v Speaker 1>I don't want anybody to be out of work or anything,</v>

68
00:02:02.721 --> 00:02:03.800
<v Speaker 1>but man,</v>

69
00:02:03.801 --> 00:02:08.801
<v Speaker 1>the difference is so profound that there's no competition like taxis or like you</v>

70
00:02:09.201 --> 00:02:09.351
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

71
00:02:09.351 --> 00:02:13.460
<v Speaker 1>they've got that fucking TV in the back where it's commercials or like blaring</v>

72
00:02:13.461 --> 00:02:16.740
<v Speaker 1>into your face the whole time and you're just sort of like,</v>

73
00:02:16.741 --> 00:02:20.840
<v Speaker 1>it's if you feel like you're in a traveling prison because they've got the plexi</v>

74
00:02:20.841 --> 00:02:23.390
<v Speaker 1>glass in between you and the driver,</v>

75
00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.990
<v Speaker 1>because we live in such a crazy dimension where people who drive other people</v>

76
00:02:26.991 --> 00:02:31.991
<v Speaker 1>around have to treat them like pythons or something and put them behind glass</v>

77
00:02:32.001 --> 00:02:33.500
<v Speaker 1>just because that one guy with,</v>

78
00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:34.610
<v Speaker 1>with the ice pick.</v>

79
00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.821
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

80
00:02:34.821 --> 00:02:36.410
<v Speaker 1>do you know how many piece on Ted,</v>

81
00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:37.850
<v Speaker 1>one guy with the ice pack do?</v>

82
00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.040
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what happened in New York City one year?</v>

83
00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:41.030
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

84
00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.380
<v Speaker 1>They killed some insane number of gypsy cab drivers,</v>

85
00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:46.101
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

86
00:02:46.101 --> 00:02:49.330
<v Speaker 1>What a gypsy cab driver would they call gypsy cab driver is someone who's</v>

87
00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.800
<v Speaker 1>working kind of without it was like pre Uber.</v>

88
00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:52.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

89
00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.190
<v Speaker 1>It was like they were working without a license or they're working with some,</v>

90
00:02:55.191 --> 00:03:00.191
<v Speaker 1>some shenanigans were involved and they would these guys to bad neighborhoods</v>

91
00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.640
<v Speaker 1>and shoot them in the back of the head and they shot a bunch of them.</v>

92
00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.830
<v Speaker 1>They showed a bunch of them paid criminals.</v>

93
00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.410
<v Speaker 1>It was like something they did to rob people.</v>

94
00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:13.060
<v Speaker 1>They take these gypsy cab drivers deepen in New York City somewhere like</v>

95
00:03:13.061 --> 00:03:14.760
<v Speaker 1>Brownsville or somewhere like that.</v>

96
00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:17.500
<v Speaker 1>Shoot them in the back of the head and then dumped their cap.</v>

97
00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:18.610
<v Speaker 1>Ah Dude.</v>

98
00:03:18.611 --> 00:03:19.510
<v Speaker 1>It was crazy.</v>

99
00:03:19.511 --> 00:03:21.130
<v Speaker 1>Like it happened a lot.</v>

100
00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.701
<v Speaker 1>There was a,</v>

101
00:03:21.701 --> 00:03:23.290
<v Speaker 1>I forget what year it was,</v>

102
00:03:23.291 --> 00:03:27.100
<v Speaker 1>but they had no idea how many people were involved.</v>

103
00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.290
<v Speaker 1>They didn't know who was getting does pre Internet.</v>

104
00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:30.370
<v Speaker 1>Did they ever catch the guy?</v>

105
00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:31.211
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

106
00:03:31.211 --> 00:03:32.410
<v Speaker 1>I wish I knew that answer.</v>

107
00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:33.060
<v Speaker 1>I wish I,</v>

108
00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm kind of serial killer or some kind of who is either a serial killer or a</v>

109
00:03:37.541 --> 00:03:40.960
<v Speaker 1>practice of robbing people and shooting them in the head.</v>

110
00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:42.940
<v Speaker 1>How hungry are you?</v>

111
00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:43.781
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

112
00:03:43.781 --> 00:03:44.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

113
00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:48.580
<v Speaker 1>you'll have to be so hungry to decide that you're going to get in a cab and go</v>

114
00:03:48.581 --> 00:03:52.510
<v Speaker 1>through the trouble of blasting someone in the back of the head to get how much</v>

115
00:03:52.511 --> 00:03:54.580
<v Speaker 1>money are they going to have maximum and a cab,</v>

116
00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:56.440
<v Speaker 1>how much would that have?</v>

117
00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:56.921
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

118
00:03:56.921 --> 00:03:58.030
<v Speaker 1>I mean a few hundred bucks,</v>

119
00:03:58.031 --> 00:04:00.220
<v Speaker 1>who knows a thousand maximum.</v>

120
00:04:00.221 --> 00:04:00.700
<v Speaker 1>Who knows?</v>

121
00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:01.390
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>

122
00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:04.270
<v Speaker 1>it's just hard to believe that it could be a million and someone would just</v>

123
00:04:04.271 --> 00:04:05.620
<v Speaker 1>shoot someone in the fucking head.</v>

124
00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.851
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

125
00:04:06.851 --> 00:04:07.684
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

126
00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.660
<v Speaker 1>it's weird when you get to a certain number and people go,</v>

127
00:04:10.661 --> 00:04:10.721
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

128
00:04:10.721 --> 00:04:11.200
<v Speaker 1>I got it.</v>

129
00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:11.480
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

130
00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.210
<v Speaker 1>someone kills someone for 1 million bucks.</v>

131
00:04:13.211 --> 00:04:13.391
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

132
00:04:13.391 --> 00:04:13.900
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

133
00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.660
<v Speaker 1>well it was $1 million is probably really tempting.</v>

134
00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.381
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

135
00:04:17.381 --> 00:04:18.161
<v Speaker 1>for some people,</v>

136
00:04:18.161 --> 00:04:18.880
<v Speaker 1>probably I don't,</v>

137
00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:19.990
<v Speaker 1>but it's ridiculous.</v>

138
00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:22.900
<v Speaker 1>You shouldn't be able to kill somebody for a hundred you shouldn't be able to</v>

139
00:04:22.901 --> 00:04:23.980
<v Speaker 1>kill someone for a million,</v>

140
00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:25.360
<v Speaker 1>but for whatever reason,</v>

141
00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.180
<v Speaker 1>if you say it was only for 100 bucks,</v>

142
00:04:28.181 --> 00:04:30.100
<v Speaker 1>they kill them like somehow or another.</v>

143
00:04:30.101 --> 00:04:31.960
<v Speaker 1>It makes it like more pointless.</v>

144
00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:33.880
<v Speaker 1>It killed him for 1 million bucks.</v>

145
00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:35.830
<v Speaker 1>I mean it really weird.</v>

146
00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:38.050
<v Speaker 1>It's like a brinks truck for example,</v>

147
00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:40.510
<v Speaker 1>like a brinks truck you can cause you're thinking like,</v>

148
00:04:40.511 --> 00:04:41.344
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

149
00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.410
<v Speaker 1>desperate criminal needs some cash.</v>

150
00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:46.120
<v Speaker 1>If I'm going to kill somebody.</v>

151
00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.841
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's a,</v>

152
00:04:46.841 --> 00:04:48.670
<v Speaker 1>obviously a terrible thing to do.</v>

153
00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:54.120
<v Speaker 1>I want to have enough money to live on it for at least a couple of months.</v>

154
00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:59.110
<v Speaker 1>Not enough to like go bowling that night and like that's it.</v>

155
00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:00.670
<v Speaker 1>You got to get another cab.</v>

156
00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:04.300
<v Speaker 1>If you're one of those Uber drivers though,</v>

157
00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:08.740
<v Speaker 1>I mean how much protection do they have the Uber drivers from getting robbed?</v>

158
00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:09.880
<v Speaker 1>Things along those lines.</v>

159
00:05:09.881 --> 00:05:11.290
<v Speaker 1>Is it harder because of phones?</v>

160
00:05:11.291 --> 00:05:11.770
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

161
00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:12.251
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

162
00:05:12.251 --> 00:05:13.990
<v Speaker 1>Well I guess the people are being tracked,</v>

163
00:05:13.991 --> 00:05:18.730
<v Speaker 1>but I mean obviously the ultimate frightening scenario is someone like steal</v>

164
00:05:18.731 --> 00:05:19.720
<v Speaker 1>someone's phone,</v>

165
00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:24.040
<v Speaker 1>uses their Uber App and summons that Uber and then they're completely</v>

166
00:05:24.041 --> 00:05:25.030
<v Speaker 1>untraceable.</v>

167
00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:27.400
<v Speaker 1>So I think that's probably a,</v>

168
00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:29.500
<v Speaker 1>a danger that the Uber drivers think about it.</v>

169
00:05:29.501 --> 00:05:30.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure they teach them,</v>

170
00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:32.050
<v Speaker 1>you know what to do.</v>

171
00:05:32.051 --> 00:05:34.190
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure they've been like tutored or are they there?</v>

172
00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:35.650
<v Speaker 1>It's gotta be safety courses.</v>

173
00:05:35.651 --> 00:05:39.310
<v Speaker 1>They're taking for the inevitable situation where somebody gets in there and</v>

174
00:05:39.311 --> 00:05:44.050
<v Speaker 1>thinks they're the reincarnation of Christ and wants to taste blood on a full</v>

175
00:05:44.051 --> 00:05:44.884
<v Speaker 1>moon.</v>

176
00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:46.973
<v Speaker 1>What it's,</v>

177
00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:51.420
<v Speaker 1>I think at the harder situation would be for the young women who were bothered</v>

178
00:05:51.421 --> 00:05:52.420
<v Speaker 1>and nine young women,</v>

179
00:05:52.421 --> 00:05:53.950
<v Speaker 1>women who are by themselves,</v>

180
00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:57.230
<v Speaker 1>who get in a car with a guy that they don't know and they don't know whether not</v>

181
00:05:57.231 --> 00:05:58.130
<v Speaker 1>he's been screened</v>

182
00:05:58.130 --> 00:05:58.963
<v Speaker 3>properly.</v>

183
00:05:59.690 --> 00:05:59.961
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

184
00:05:59.961 --> 00:06:00.500
<v Speaker 4>that's right.</v>

185
00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:02.210
<v Speaker 4>Or faking being an Uber driver.</v>

186
00:06:02.211 --> 00:06:02.451
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

187
00:06:02.451 --> 00:06:03.580
<v Speaker 4>how hard would that be?</v>

188
00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:06.770
<v Speaker 4>Pull up in front of any club and look at and be like Uber,</v>

189
00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:07.660
<v Speaker 4>Uber.</v>

190
00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:08.270
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

191
00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:09.230
<v Speaker 4>Easy Dude.</v>

192
00:06:09.231 --> 00:06:09.860
<v Speaker 4>Shit.</v>

193
00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:10.281
<v Speaker 4>Easy.</v>

194
00:06:10.281 --> 00:06:11.000
<v Speaker 4>So true.</v>

195
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.350
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure they've thought of that too.</v>

196
00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:15.131
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

197
00:06:15.131 --> 00:06:18.400
<v Speaker 3>Well I've had people try to get into my car accidentally cause they thought it</v>

198
00:06:18.401 --> 00:06:19.060
<v Speaker 3>was Dubar.</v>

199
00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:20.350
<v Speaker 3>We rented the escalate.</v>

200
00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:20.981
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

201
00:06:20.981 --> 00:06:22.810
<v Speaker 3>Opened the door and we're like,</v>

202
00:06:22.811 --> 00:06:23.550
<v Speaker 3>hello.</v>

203
00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:24.383
<v Speaker 3>And they're like,</v>

204
00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:25.450
<v Speaker 3>we're a,</v>

205
00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:26.201
<v Speaker 3>we're here for Uber.</v>

206
00:06:26.201 --> 00:06:26.471
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

207
00:06:26.471 --> 00:06:27.304
<v Speaker 3>no man,</v>

208
00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:28.543
<v Speaker 4>I'm not Uber.</v>

209
00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:29.460
<v Speaker 4>Hilarious.</v>

210
00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:30.121
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

211
00:06:30.121 --> 00:06:30.331
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

212
00:06:30.331 --> 00:06:31.740
<v Speaker 4>You can get in a lot of trouble.</v>

213
00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:32.440
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

214
00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:34.650
<v Speaker 4>you can get a lot of trouble out there in the world,</v>

215
00:06:34.651 --> 00:06:34.861
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

216
00:06:34.861 --> 00:06:39.390
<v Speaker 4>It's so strange to think that in this beautiful time that we're living in and it</v>

217
00:06:39.391 --> 00:06:40.650
<v Speaker 4>really is a beautiful time,</v>

218
00:06:40.651 --> 00:06:40.831
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

219
00:06:40.831 --> 00:06:41.920
<v Speaker 4>It's an incredible time.</v>

220
00:06:41.921 --> 00:06:42.754
<v Speaker 4>Amazing.</v>

221
00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:47.490
<v Speaker 4>It was so strange to think of how there are still predators existing in our</v>

222
00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:51.420
<v Speaker 4>ecosystem even though I think it's much less than it used to be.</v>

223
00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:55.320
<v Speaker 4>It's just a fascinating thing to think that there's people out there whose heads</v>

224
00:06:55.321 --> 00:07:00.321
<v Speaker 4>are just filled with psychic bees and for whatever reason that ring driven out</v>

225
00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:04.350
<v Speaker 4>into the streets and they do awful fucking shit still.</v>

226
00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:06.240
<v Speaker 4>If it just becomes more shocking,</v>

227
00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:10.500
<v Speaker 4>the more a technology accelerates those acts of violence,</v>

228
00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:11.760
<v Speaker 4>they stand out more,</v>

229
00:07:11.761 --> 00:07:12.840
<v Speaker 4>they seem more</v>

230
00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:15.570
<v Speaker 4>barbaric,</v>

231
00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:16.760
<v Speaker 3>they seem more horrific.</v>

232
00:07:16.761 --> 00:07:20.000
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's really what's fueling like the furthest,</v>

233
00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:22.760
<v Speaker 3>most fringe left wing ideas.</v>

234
00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:26.780
<v Speaker 3>That's like one of my number one problems that I have with like super</v>

235
00:07:26.781 --> 00:07:30.260
<v Speaker 3>progressive people is that our agree with them on almost everything.</v>

236
00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:35.660
<v Speaker 3>But sometimes the way they go about expressing themselves is so ridiculously</v>

237
00:07:35.661 --> 00:07:37.700
<v Speaker 3>over the top that they become annoying.</v>

238
00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:42.350
<v Speaker 3>And how do you mean they become bad for the cause or bad for whatever idea they</v>

239
00:07:42.351 --> 00:07:43.184
<v Speaker 3>have.</v>

240
00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:44.990
<v Speaker 3>But ultimately what are they trying to do?</v>

241
00:07:44.991 --> 00:07:47.030
<v Speaker 3>They're just trying to write it all out.</v>

242
00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:50.780
<v Speaker 3>It's just the going so far and they're so ridiculous with some of the ideas that</v>

243
00:07:50.781 --> 00:07:52.100
<v Speaker 3>it just by quiet,</v>

244
00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:53.120
<v Speaker 3>Oh God,</v>

245
00:07:53.121 --> 00:07:56.480
<v Speaker 3>where would I begin the the use of language.</v>

246
00:07:56.510 --> 00:07:57.590
<v Speaker 3>It's a really important one.</v>

247
00:07:57.950 --> 00:08:02.570
<v Speaker 3>You know like the people that get like super upset at rape scenes in a movie or</v>

248
00:08:02.571 --> 00:08:05.030
<v Speaker 3>rape scenes on a television show.</v>

249
00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:10.060
<v Speaker 3>People that think that men and women don't have to adhere to gender specific</v>

250
00:08:11.841 --> 00:08:12.710
<v Speaker 3>roles,</v>

251
00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:13.370
<v Speaker 3>which I agree.</v>

252
00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:13.581
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

253
00:08:13.581 --> 00:08:14.211
<v Speaker 3>you don't have to,</v>

254
00:08:14.211 --> 00:08:15.890
<v Speaker 3>but to think that that's not the norm,</v>

255
00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:16.731
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

256
00:08:16.731 --> 00:08:21.620
<v Speaker 3>to think that in some way gender specific roles for people aren't sort of carved</v>

257
00:08:21.621 --> 00:08:23.000
<v Speaker 3>out in some ways by biologists.</v>

258
00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:23.341
<v Speaker 4>Man.</v>

259
00:08:23.341 --> 00:08:24.360
<v Speaker 4>I gotta tell you though,</v>

260
00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:25.081
<v Speaker 4>that is a,</v>

261
00:08:25.081 --> 00:08:26.190
<v Speaker 4>that is a thing that,</v>

262
00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:26.611
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

263
00:08:26.611 --> 00:08:26.970
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

264
00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:28.620
<v Speaker 4>that idea is,</v>

265
00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:32.160
<v Speaker 4>we'll be an antiquated idea within 200 years.</v>

266
00:08:32.161 --> 00:08:37.161
<v Speaker 4>I think that will be the idea that your do your genetic gender assignment is the</v>

267
00:08:38.191 --> 00:08:41.880
<v Speaker 4>gender you got to stick with will be like thinking the Avatar that you pick in</v>

268
00:08:41.881 --> 00:08:46.881
<v Speaker 4>GTA is the Avatar that you've got to run around with permanently because it's</v>

269
00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:51.030
<v Speaker 4>going to get easier and easier to modify the body.</v>

270
00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:51.631
<v Speaker 4>We don't,</v>

271
00:08:51.631 --> 00:08:55.050
<v Speaker 4>we have no idea what's coming down the tubes when it comes.</v>

272
00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:55.710
<v Speaker 4>This,</v>

273
00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:58.620
<v Speaker 4>the new stuff that they're learning about how to alter DNA.</v>

274
00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:03.300
<v Speaker 4>We have no idea what's coming down the tubes when it comes to like futuristic</v>

275
00:09:03.301 --> 00:09:06.150
<v Speaker 4>plastic surgery and the ease of it,</v>

276
00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:06.530
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>

277
00:09:06.530 --> 00:09:07.470
<v Speaker 4>we just don't know.</v>

278
00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:07.741
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

279
00:09:07.741 --> 00:09:08.521
<v Speaker 4>no doubt man.</v>

280
00:09:08.521 --> 00:09:09.210
<v Speaker 4>No doubt.</v>

281
00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:10.200
<v Speaker 4>So when that happens,</v>

282
00:09:10.201 --> 00:09:11.130
<v Speaker 4>it's cause it's kind of like,</v>

283
00:09:11.131 --> 00:09:13.170
<v Speaker 4>the reason this stuff's seems really weird,</v>

284
00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:14.213
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

285
00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:18.090
<v Speaker 4>to us is because mostly we've grown up in a time where you and I,</v>

286
00:09:18.091 --> 00:09:21.900
<v Speaker 4>especially if growing up in a time where you used w there was no,</v>

287
00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:26.060
<v Speaker 4>the words they're using right now is not the words that they used to use it</v>

288
00:09:26.090 --> 00:09:26.610
<v Speaker 4>with.</v>

289
00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:28.920
<v Speaker 4>The word tranny was not an offensive word.</v>

290
00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:30.420
<v Speaker 4>People would just use it.</v>

291
00:09:30.421 --> 00:09:30.991
<v Speaker 4>They didn't know.</v>

292
00:09:30.991 --> 00:09:31.680
<v Speaker 4>You didn't know.</v>

293
00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:35.250
<v Speaker 4>So you know what the general idea was.</v>

294
00:09:35.251 --> 00:09:37.830
<v Speaker 4>If you're growing up back in the 70s or the,</v>

295
00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:39.150
<v Speaker 4>or the early eighties.</v>

296
00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:41.790
<v Speaker 4>It's not like everybody was a complete her heart,</v>

297
00:09:41.791 --> 00:09:42.870
<v Speaker 4>horrible bigot.</v>

298
00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:45.990
<v Speaker 4>But at least I grew up in North Carolina.</v>

299
00:09:45.991 --> 00:09:50.991
<v Speaker 4>So the public opinion on transsexual people is not what you would consider to be</v>

300
00:09:52.021 --> 00:09:52.711
<v Speaker 4>rosy.</v>

301
00:09:52.711 --> 00:09:53.850
<v Speaker 4>It's not like people are like,</v>

302
00:09:53.851 --> 00:09:54.690
<v Speaker 4>they deserve rights,</v>

303
00:09:54.691 --> 00:09:56.090
<v Speaker 4>they should get married and you live,</v>

304
00:09:56.100 --> 00:10:00.030
<v Speaker 4>we're in a topic of discussion and wasn't even a topic of discussion,</v>

305
00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:01.140
<v Speaker 4>but the,</v>

306
00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:01.861
<v Speaker 4>but now,</v>

307
00:10:01.861 --> 00:10:02.101
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

308
00:10:02.101 --> 00:10:03.240
<v Speaker 4>people are realizing,</v>

309
00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:03.931
<v Speaker 4>Oh shit man,</v>

310
00:10:03.931 --> 00:10:06.390
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if I have to be,</v>

311
00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:06.840
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

312
00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:09.540
<v Speaker 4>physically what my genetics are saying.</v>

313
00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:10.920
<v Speaker 4>I have to be.</v>

314
00:10:11.130 --> 00:10:12.160
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

315
00:10:12.190 --> 00:10:13.170
<v Speaker 4>so they go through this,</v>

316
00:10:14.090 --> 00:10:15.510
<v Speaker 4>the thing Bruce Jenner's going through,</v>

317
00:10:15.511 --> 00:10:17.550
<v Speaker 4>they take hormone replacement therapy,</v>

318
00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:18.750
<v Speaker 4>I guess they get their,</v>

319
00:10:18.751 --> 00:10:21.090
<v Speaker 4>their penis cut off and they get a vagina.</v>

320
00:10:21.510 --> 00:10:21.811
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

321
00:10:21.811 --> 00:10:24.270
<v Speaker 4>and I don't think that you'd like to have you phrase it like that.</v>

322
00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:25.380
<v Speaker 4>How do you phrase it?</v>

323
00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:26.160
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

324
00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:27.120
<v Speaker 4>they get reconstructed.</v>

325
00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:28.291
<v Speaker 4>Well the,</v>

326
00:10:28.291 --> 00:10:28.710
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

327
00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:29.131
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

328
00:10:29.131 --> 00:10:30.210
<v Speaker 4>well that's scary.</v>

329
00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:33.750
<v Speaker 4>Imagine sitting in when you're in your Uber and the guy in the back seats as do</v>

330
00:10:33.751 --> 00:10:35.550
<v Speaker 4>you want to get reconstructed tonight?</v>

331
00:10:35.610 --> 00:10:37.990
<v Speaker 4>I honestly think that there's gonna come a point in time we go,</v>

332
00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:39.780
<v Speaker 4>or they're going to be able to change you into anything.</v>

333
00:10:39.810 --> 00:10:40.440
<v Speaker 4>That's it.</v>

334
00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:41.310
<v Speaker 4>Anything male,</v>

335
00:10:41.311 --> 00:10:41.731
<v Speaker 4>female,</v>

336
00:10:41.731 --> 00:10:44.310
<v Speaker 4>you will go back and forth from male to female.</v>

337
00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:44.730
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

338
00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:46.470
<v Speaker 4>I mean it might be a thousand years from now,</v>

339
00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:47.490
<v Speaker 4>but it's coming.</v>

340
00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:48.810
<v Speaker 4>It's coming sooner than that,</v>

341
00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:51.300
<v Speaker 4>at least in VR space because of the,</v>

342
00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:51.900
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

343
00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:52.231
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

344
00:10:52.231 --> 00:10:52.501
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

345
00:10:52.501 --> 00:10:53.180
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

346
00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:55.620
<v Speaker 4>I was just at this fucking crazy,</v>

347
00:10:55.650 --> 00:10:55.831
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

348
00:10:55.831 --> 00:10:58.080
<v Speaker 4>virtual reality gathering downtown,</v>

349
00:10:58.081 --> 00:10:59.220
<v Speaker 4>cause I'm pals with this guy,</v>

350
00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:00.211
<v Speaker 4>Johnny Ross.</v>

351
00:11:00.211 --> 00:11:01.050
<v Speaker 4>He puts him on,</v>

352
00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:03.390
<v Speaker 4>they had everything there,</v>

353
00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:04.111
<v Speaker 4>everything there,</v>

354
00:11:04.111 --> 00:11:05.580
<v Speaker 4>all the new high tech stuff was there.</v>

355
00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:08.280
<v Speaker 4>They had the new valve VR prototype,</v>

356
00:11:08.281 --> 00:11:08.581
<v Speaker 4>which is,</v>

357
00:11:08.581 --> 00:11:10.800
<v Speaker 4>this makes my oculus rift look like shit.</v>

358
00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:12.450
<v Speaker 4>But one of the things they add,</v>

359
00:11:12.451 --> 00:11:13.680
<v Speaker 4>which was so incredible,</v>

360
00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:18.980
<v Speaker 4>was a software that scans your face and then turns that into the mask of some</v>

361
00:11:20.251 --> 00:11:21.090
<v Speaker 4>other thing.</v>

362
00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:22.740
<v Speaker 4>So if you're playing a video game,</v>

363
00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:24.270
<v Speaker 4>you're theoretically,</v>

364
00:11:24.271 --> 00:11:29.271
<v Speaker 4>your face would be sort of being scanned and what it would look completely</v>

365
00:11:29.491 --> 00:11:29.821
<v Speaker 4>different.</v>

366
00:11:29.821 --> 00:11:33.690
<v Speaker 4>The expressions you are making in the real world would translate into the</v>

367
00:11:33.691 --> 00:11:34.524
<v Speaker 4>Avatar.</v>

368
00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:39.540
<v Speaker 4>And that's pretty bad ass man to be able to play an online role playing game</v>

369
00:11:39.810 --> 00:11:44.810
<v Speaker 4>with avatars that are making real human facial expressions and not just one</v>

370
00:11:45.510 --> 00:11:46.470
<v Speaker 4>function of it.</v>

371
00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:46.951
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

372
00:11:46.951 --> 00:11:48.660
<v Speaker 4>but it doesn't have to freak you out.</v>

373
00:11:49.290 --> 00:11:50.123
<v Speaker 4>I love it.</v>

374
00:11:50.510 --> 00:11:51.900
<v Speaker 4>Try to give you any pause.</v>

375
00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:53.530
<v Speaker 4>It used to just go,</v>

376
00:11:53.531 --> 00:11:55.060
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck are we doing?</v>

377
00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:57.310
<v Speaker 4>I used to really not anymore,</v>

378
00:11:57.311 --> 00:11:57.520
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

379
00:11:57.520 --> 00:11:58.150
<v Speaker 4>I happen.</v>

380
00:11:58.150 --> 00:11:59.020
<v Speaker 4>I lifted my,</v>

381
00:11:59.021 --> 00:12:00.790
<v Speaker 4>took Timothy Leary's advice.</v>

382
00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:01.450
<v Speaker 4>What was it?</v>

383
00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:03.820
<v Speaker 4>Lift up your legs and float downstream.</v>

384
00:12:04.810 --> 00:12:06.070
<v Speaker 4>Don't worry.</v>

385
00:12:06.071 --> 00:12:07.300
<v Speaker 4>Stop freaking out.</v>

386
00:12:07.570 --> 00:12:08.150
<v Speaker 4>Don't,</v>

387
00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:09.010
<v Speaker 4>there's nothing.</v>

388
00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:09.873
<v Speaker 4>Number one,</v>

389
00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:11.920
<v Speaker 4>you're not stopping it now.</v>

390
00:12:11.950 --> 00:12:13.930
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't matter who you are.</v>

391
00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:16.660
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't matter what plan you have.</v>

392
00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:18.730
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't mean you ain't stopping it.</v>

393
00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:21.430
<v Speaker 4>Elan Musk could take his clothes off,</v>

394
00:12:21.610 --> 00:12:23.710
<v Speaker 4>climb on the top of the empire state building,</v>

395
00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:28.860
<v Speaker 4>and hold a banner that says AI is going to destroy all humanity and nobody would</v>

396
00:12:28.931 --> 00:12:32.110
<v Speaker 4>pay attention because you're talking about something that seems to be more of a,</v>

397
00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:35.530
<v Speaker 4>something deeper than just human innovation.</v>

398
00:12:35.531 --> 00:12:37.810
<v Speaker 4>It seems to be something like more of a,</v>

399
00:12:38.060 --> 00:12:43.060
<v Speaker 4>a kind of momentum and an extra Robel momentum in the direction of us having</v>

400
00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:49.020
<v Speaker 4>100% control over the way we express ourselves and the things we create and,</v>

401
00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:54.490
<v Speaker 4>and not being limited by our current meat bodies in any way at all.</v>

402
00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:57.220
<v Speaker 4>That's where it's headed and that's just one little piece of it.</v>

403
00:12:57.400 --> 00:12:58.480
<v Speaker 4>It's not going to stop.</v>

404
00:12:58.900 --> 00:12:59.321
<v Speaker 4>In fact,</v>

405
00:12:59.321 --> 00:13:00.640
<v Speaker 4>this is the last age,</v>

406
00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:02.230
<v Speaker 4>everyone should just,</v>

407
00:13:02.310 --> 00:13:02.650
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

408
00:13:02.650 --> 00:13:07.650
<v Speaker 4>go outside and look around and enjoy a world where people aren't wearing visors.</v>

409
00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:13.560
<v Speaker 4>In a world where all the clouds of data surrounding you aren't being visualized</v>

410
00:13:14.231 --> 00:13:18.640
<v Speaker 4>in a variety of ways that have been created by programmers,</v>

411
00:13:18.641 --> 00:13:19.630
<v Speaker 4>because that's what we're looking at.</v>

412
00:13:19.631 --> 00:13:24.631
<v Speaker 4>Just the entire universe animated with information in real time and people,</v>

413
00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:30.340
<v Speaker 4>people's faces being whatever they want it to be,</v>

414
00:13:30.341 --> 00:13:32.250
<v Speaker 4>people's bodies being whatever they want it to be.</v>

415
00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:33.820
<v Speaker 3>I think it goes past that.</v>

416
00:13:33.850 --> 00:13:36.220
<v Speaker 3>I think whatever you are as a human being,</v>

417
00:13:36.221 --> 00:13:40.030
<v Speaker 3>you're going to eventually accept as being a digital form because it's going to</v>

418
00:13:40.031 --> 00:13:41.680
<v Speaker 3>be more exciting than the flesh.</v>

419
00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:43.780
<v Speaker 3>You want to get to a point where it's going to be better.</v>

420
00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:44.591
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>

421
00:13:44.591 --> 00:13:47.980
<v Speaker 3>the idea of you downloading your brain to computer right now is horrific.</v>

422
00:13:48.370 --> 00:13:48.611
<v Speaker 3>I'll go,</v>

423
00:13:48.611 --> 00:13:48.911
<v Speaker 3>my God,</v>

424
00:13:48.911 --> 00:13:49.840
<v Speaker 3>why would I want to do that?</v>

425
00:13:49.870 --> 00:13:50.200
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

426
00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:50.741
<v Speaker 3>But the idea,</v>

427
00:13:50.741 --> 00:13:54.130
<v Speaker 3>if they can get your car and then biologist say it's impossible,</v>

428
00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:56.200
<v Speaker 3>but I just think it's impossible now,</v>

429
00:13:56.530 --> 00:13:57.610
<v Speaker 3>but if they can get,</v>

430
00:13:57.640 --> 00:13:59.650
<v Speaker 3>whenever your consciousness is,</v>

431
00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:05.200
<v Speaker 3>they can get a digital image of that absolute three d every molecule in exactly</v>

432
00:14:06.851 --> 00:14:07.684
<v Speaker 3>the right place,</v>

433
00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:09.490
<v Speaker 3>digital image of you,</v>

434
00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:14.880
<v Speaker 3>and they can convert this into an artificial body in instantaneously.</v>

435
00:14:15.371 --> 00:14:16.660
<v Speaker 3>You will be conscious and aware.</v>

436
00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:17.380
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

437
00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:18.430
<v Speaker 3>that one's going to shut off.</v>

438
00:14:18.490 --> 00:14:20.140
<v Speaker 3>This one's going to show it on click,</v>

439
00:14:20.170 --> 00:14:20.710
<v Speaker 3>click.</v>

440
00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:21.191
<v Speaker 3>Here we go.</v>

441
00:14:21.191 --> 00:14:21.550
<v Speaker 3>Dunkin.</v>

442
00:14:21.550 --> 00:14:22.140
<v Speaker 3>How are you?</v>

443
00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:22.540
<v Speaker 3>Great.</v>

444
00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:23.410
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God,</v>

445
00:14:23.411 --> 00:14:24.244
<v Speaker 3>I'm in the mall.</v>

446
00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:28.040
<v Speaker 3>He more,</v>

447
00:14:28.370 --> 00:14:29.270
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>

448
00:14:29.271 --> 00:14:30.770
<v Speaker 4>you'd be a digital voice.</v>

449
00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:31.340
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

450
00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:32.350
<v Speaker 4>You'll be a great full,</v>

451
00:14:32.370 --> 00:14:33.500
<v Speaker 4>it'll be a great voice.</v>

452
00:14:33.501 --> 00:14:34.334
<v Speaker 4>You'll have.</v>

453
00:14:34.430 --> 00:14:34.731
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

454
00:14:34.731 --> 00:14:35.391
<v Speaker 4>it'll be great.</v>

455
00:14:35.391 --> 00:14:35.990
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

456
00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:36.620
<v Speaker 4>it's one,</v>

457
00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:37.640
<v Speaker 4>it's wonderful.</v>

458
00:14:37.641 --> 00:14:38.120
<v Speaker 4>What's,</v>

459
00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:39.380
<v Speaker 4>what's happening is wonderful,</v>

460
00:14:39.381 --> 00:14:39.830
<v Speaker 4>but it's,</v>

461
00:14:39.830 --> 00:14:41.690
<v Speaker 4>it is scary for a lot of people.</v>

462
00:14:41.930 --> 00:14:42.531
<v Speaker 4>But man,</v>

463
00:14:42.531 --> 00:14:42.830
<v Speaker 4>just,</v>

464
00:14:42.830 --> 00:14:43.663
<v Speaker 4>just the,</v>

465
00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:48.650
<v Speaker 4>that we have so many restrictions on us that are based on our biology.</v>

466
00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:49.370
<v Speaker 4>We,</v>

467
00:14:49.370 --> 00:14:51.650
<v Speaker 4>humanity has just grown to accept you.</v>

468
00:14:51.651 --> 00:14:53.450
<v Speaker 4>If you accept growing old,</v>

469
00:14:53.690 --> 00:14:58.690
<v Speaker 4>you accept whatever your particular physical disabilities or talents have to be.</v>

470
00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:04.960
<v Speaker 4>The idea that these could be enhanced in such profound ways with exoskeletons or</v>

471
00:15:07.761 --> 00:15:09.320
<v Speaker 4>with some kind of new,</v>

472
00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:12.170
<v Speaker 4>a cybernetic red blood cells.</v>

473
00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:13.270
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

474
00:15:13.270 --> 00:15:13.570
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

475
00:15:13.570 --> 00:15:14.420
<v Speaker 4>it's crazy,</v>

476
00:15:14.421 --> 00:15:16.640
<v Speaker 4>but it really does mirror a video game.</v>

477
00:15:16.970 --> 00:15:17.271
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

478
00:15:17.271 --> 00:15:18.520
<v Speaker 4>in a video game when I,</v>

479
00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:21.860
<v Speaker 4>the character levels up and it becomes a whole new game,</v>

480
00:15:21.861 --> 00:15:23.120
<v Speaker 4>the game gets interesting again.</v>

481
00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:25.520
<v Speaker 4>That's what's about to happen to our species.</v>

482
00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:27.800
<v Speaker 4>Like our species is about to level up.</v>

483
00:15:27.830 --> 00:15:31.430
<v Speaker 4>It's about to become an entirely new thing.</v>

484
00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:32.413
<v Speaker 4>And it's a,</v>

485
00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:35.750
<v Speaker 4>it's a few specific technologies that are all converging,</v>

486
00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:36.471
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

487
00:15:36.471 --> 00:15:37.910
<v Speaker 4>that are forming this thing.</v>

488
00:15:37.911 --> 00:15:38.001
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

489
00:15:38.001 --> 00:15:40.160
<v Speaker 4>and those technologies are three d printing,</v>

490
00:15:40.670 --> 00:15:42.410
<v Speaker 4>robotics and AI.</v>

491
00:15:42.770 --> 00:15:43.603
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

492
00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:44.330
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

493
00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:46.550
<v Speaker 4>the legalization of psychedelics,</v>

494
00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:47.361
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

495
00:15:47.361 --> 00:15:50.690
<v Speaker 4>and farm psychopharmacology that's happening right now,</v>

496
00:15:50.730 --> 00:15:54.380
<v Speaker 4>the exploration into psychedelics and uh,</v>

497
00:15:55.130 --> 00:15:59.350
<v Speaker 4>all forms of life extension therapy and all of these things are,</v>

498
00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:00.260
<v Speaker 4>they're meeting,</v>

499
00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:01.520
<v Speaker 4>they're all going to meet,</v>

500
00:16:01.790 --> 00:16:03.050
<v Speaker 4>they're all growing together.</v>

501
00:16:03.051 --> 00:16:08.051
<v Speaker 4>They're all appendages that are growing out of this sentient life form that</v>

502
00:16:09.051 --> 00:16:12.410
<v Speaker 4>seems to be that we seem to be headed towards a,</v>

503
00:16:12.411 --> 00:16:14.990
<v Speaker 4>on our temporal spaceship that we call planet earth.</v>

504
00:16:15.230 --> 00:16:18.650
<v Speaker 4>And the appendages are sort of right now we're beginning to see the first</v>

505
00:16:18.651 --> 00:16:22.070
<v Speaker 4>budding growths of them and the rudimentary Vr,</v>

506
00:16:22.071 --> 00:16:26.450
<v Speaker 4>the rudimentary AI or the rudimentary three d printing.</v>

507
00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:29.270
<v Speaker 4>But the idea that you can go into an artificial,</v>

508
00:16:29.271 --> 00:16:34.271
<v Speaker 4>and I know a virtual space created by an artificial intelligence that is a</v>

509
00:16:35.270 --> 00:16:39.260
<v Speaker 4>replication of something that you have stored in your memory that's been</v>

510
00:16:39.261 --> 00:16:44.120
<v Speaker 4>downloaded and scan so that you could go and live inside a memory in three d</v>

511
00:16:44.121 --> 00:16:44.954
<v Speaker 4>space.</v>

512
00:16:45.470 --> 00:16:46.820
<v Speaker 4>And then within that memory,</v>

513
00:16:47.930 --> 00:16:50.840
<v Speaker 4>have some piece of it printed out in a three d printer.</v>

514
00:16:51.470 --> 00:16:52.011
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

515
00:16:52.011 --> 00:16:52.821
<v Speaker 4>Like Holy Shit,</v>

516
00:16:52.821 --> 00:16:57.320
<v Speaker 4>I'm hanging out at my grandmother's house when I was six because they were able</v>

517
00:16:57.321 --> 00:17:01.910
<v Speaker 4>to scan my memories and Tran digitize it and put it in VR space.</v>

518
00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:03.073
<v Speaker 4>Oh look,</v>

519
00:17:03.170 --> 00:17:03.930
<v Speaker 4>there's that.</v>

520
00:17:03.930 --> 00:17:07.010
<v Speaker 4>A pendant that my grandmother liked a computer.</v>

521
00:17:07.011 --> 00:17:09.050
<v Speaker 4>Print that out and then boom.</v>

522
00:17:09.051 --> 00:17:13.820
<v Speaker 4>Now you've got a three d representation of something inside your memories.</v>

523
00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:15.010
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>

524
00:17:15.011 --> 00:17:15.844
<v Speaker 4>I get that.</v>

525
00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:17.240
<v Speaker 4>Where are we going to put it all,</v>

526
00:17:17.930 --> 00:17:20.720
<v Speaker 4>but it will just fill the world up with three d images.</v>

527
00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:21.201
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

528
00:17:21.201 --> 00:17:23.060
<v Speaker 4>Their memories will be just clutter.</v>

529
00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:24.170
<v Speaker 4>There'll be the new clutter.</v>

530
00:17:24.430 --> 00:17:26.000
<v Speaker 4>Three d images of your past.</v>

531
00:17:26.001 --> 00:17:28.070
<v Speaker 4>Junkyards filled with old grandma,</v>

532
00:17:28.071 --> 00:17:29.660
<v Speaker 4>append and go out to a field.</v>

533
00:17:29.661 --> 00:17:30.440
<v Speaker 4>What does this,</v>

534
00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:31.850
<v Speaker 4>what does this apartment doing here?</v>

535
00:17:31.910 --> 00:17:33.170
<v Speaker 4>This is the apartment where I grew up.</v>

536
00:17:33.230 --> 00:17:34.880
<v Speaker 4>I rebuilt it out here in the field.</v>

537
00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:36.291
<v Speaker 4>See that mattress?</v>

538
00:17:36.291 --> 00:17:37.400
<v Speaker 4>I came on that mattress.</v>

539
00:17:37.610 --> 00:17:38.443
<v Speaker 4>That's my car.</v>

540
00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:40.400
<v Speaker 4>I reprinted it with the three d printer.</v>

541
00:17:41.450 --> 00:17:42.260
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

542
00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:42.830
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

543
00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:43.820
<v Speaker 4>That's what you're looking at,</v>

544
00:17:43.821 --> 00:17:44.091
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

545
00:17:44.091 --> 00:17:44.960
<v Speaker 4>That's what you're looking at.</v>

546
00:17:44.961 --> 00:17:46.190
<v Speaker 4>You or looking at,</v>

547
00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:46.920
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

548
00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:49.410
<v Speaker 4>now I now the memory downloading stuff,</v>

549
00:17:49.411 --> 00:17:50.940
<v Speaker 4>I don't know of any kind of,</v>

550
00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:51.690
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

551
00:17:51.690 --> 00:17:51.991
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

552
00:17:51.991 --> 00:17:52.110
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

553
00:17:52.110 --> 00:17:52.381
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

554
00:17:52.381 --> 00:17:54.000
<v Speaker 4>I think that's a little bit of a stretch.</v>

555
00:17:54.030 --> 00:17:57.180
<v Speaker 4>I don't know exactly where we're headed with that,</v>

556
00:17:57.210 --> 00:17:57.781
<v Speaker 4>with that stuff,</v>

557
00:17:57.781 --> 00:18:00.000
<v Speaker 4>but I do know that they're learning a lot about memory.</v>

558
00:18:00.001 --> 00:18:01.590
<v Speaker 4>I just heard that they have,</v>

559
00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:04.920
<v Speaker 4>they think that they've figured out a way to restore memory in people with</v>

560
00:18:04.921 --> 00:18:08.610
<v Speaker 4>Alzheimer's disease using some kind of like sonic technology to,</v>

561
00:18:09.150 --> 00:18:09.450
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

562
00:18:09.450 --> 00:18:09.791
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>

563
00:18:09.791 --> 00:18:13.050
<v Speaker 4>to remove the plaque that's in there and the memories come back.</v>

564
00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:17.370
<v Speaker 4>So we're learning about memories and the more we learn about memories and the</v>

565
00:18:17.371 --> 00:18:19.530
<v Speaker 4>more we learn about what you are talking about,</v>

566
00:18:19.531 --> 00:18:21.930
<v Speaker 4>which is this hyper realistic,</v>

567
00:18:21.931 --> 00:18:22.890
<v Speaker 4>detailed,</v>

568
00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:27.420
<v Speaker 4>super ultra HD scan of the human brain,</v>

569
00:18:27.690 --> 00:18:32.690
<v Speaker 4>then if that is possible to recreate consciousness than it makes sense that you</v>

570
00:18:32.701 --> 00:18:37.230
<v Speaker 4>would also be able to recreate the memory's encoded inside the neurology that</v>

571
00:18:37.231 --> 00:18:38.070
<v Speaker 4>you're duplicating.</v>

572
00:18:38.730 --> 00:18:43.730
<v Speaker 4>I think that's where I was getting at when I was talking about this idea that we</v>

573
00:18:44.011 --> 00:18:44.580
<v Speaker 4>are,</v>

574
00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:44.970
<v Speaker 4>we're,</v>

575
00:18:44.970 --> 00:18:49.260
<v Speaker 4>we're in this weird space right now or this is all happening when we were like</v>

576
00:18:49.261 --> 00:18:53.070
<v Speaker 4>caterpillars that are giving birth to a butterfly or be transforming into a</v>

577
00:18:53.071 --> 00:18:53.570
<v Speaker 4>butterfly.</v>

578
00:18:53.570 --> 00:18:53.850
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

579
00:18:53.850 --> 00:18:54.960
<v Speaker 4>And it's all happening right.</v>

580
00:18:55.020 --> 00:18:55.620
<v Speaker 5>Right in front of us.</v>

581
00:18:55.620 --> 00:18:58.890
<v Speaker 5>That's why these violent acts are so repulsive today.</v>

582
00:18:58.920 --> 00:18:59.340
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

583
00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:01.200
<v Speaker 5>I mean I think there were always repulsive,</v>

584
00:19:01.230 --> 00:19:04.720
<v Speaker 5>but now they seem particularly repulsive because you'd like badly.</v>

585
00:19:04.780 --> 00:19:06.330
<v Speaker 5>We have to look what's going on.</v>

586
00:19:06.570 --> 00:19:10.730
<v Speaker 5>Look how much crazy shit is going on if we're still having religious murders and</v>

587
00:19:10.731 --> 00:19:12.000
<v Speaker 5>all this is going on.</v>

588
00:19:12.030 --> 00:19:12.690
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

589
00:19:12.690 --> 00:19:14.280
<v Speaker 5>So it's,</v>

590
00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:19.700
<v Speaker 5>there's this weird sort of disruption in the potential of,</v>

591
00:19:20.030 --> 00:19:20.970
<v Speaker 5>of the situation.</v>

592
00:19:20.971 --> 00:19:21.660
<v Speaker 5>That's right.</v>

593
00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:25.830
<v Speaker 5>And this weird disruption is like being met with more,</v>

594
00:19:25.831 --> 00:19:29.730
<v Speaker 5>more people are looking at these disruptions now than ever before and you're</v>

595
00:19:29.731 --> 00:19:31.110
<v Speaker 5>getting extremes on that end.</v>

596
00:19:31.230 --> 00:19:33.720
<v Speaker 5>I think you and I caught a moderate in our progressiveness.</v>

597
00:19:33.990 --> 00:19:34.300
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

598
00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:37.140
<v Speaker 5>And we're both like totally pro gay marriage,</v>

599
00:19:37.141 --> 00:19:39.600
<v Speaker 5>totally pro abortion rights,</v>

600
00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:41.280
<v Speaker 5>do whatever the fuck you want to do.</v>

601
00:19:41.281 --> 00:19:42.900
<v Speaker 5>As long as you're not harming other people,</v>

602
00:19:43.410 --> 00:19:45.690
<v Speaker 5>but be responsible for your actions too.</v>

603
00:19:46.110 --> 00:19:47.880
<v Speaker 5>And I think more,</v>

604
00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:49.500
<v Speaker 5>more and more people are,</v>

605
00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:51.120
<v Speaker 5>at least in my opinion,</v>

606
00:19:51.121 --> 00:19:55.530
<v Speaker 5>what I'm running into kind and aware that I think ever in my life time,</v>

607
00:19:55.531 --> 00:19:56.850
<v Speaker 5>more people were kind of aware.</v>

608
00:19:56.970 --> 00:20:00.810
<v Speaker 5>That's where people are also aware of like the benefit of being kind.</v>

609
00:20:00.870 --> 00:20:01.380
<v Speaker 5>That's right.</v>

610
00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:03.000
<v Speaker 5>But along the way,</v>

611
00:20:03.090 --> 00:20:04.710
<v Speaker 5>you're going to have extremes on both sides.</v>

612
00:20:04.711 --> 00:20:06.510
<v Speaker 5>You're going to have extreme religious,</v>

613
00:20:06.511 --> 00:20:07.530
<v Speaker 5>crazy fucking people.</v>

614
00:20:07.531 --> 00:20:10.650
<v Speaker 5>You can cause extreme left wing lunatics.</v>

615
00:20:10.770 --> 00:20:12.090
<v Speaker 5>You can have all sorts of people.</v>

616
00:20:12.091 --> 00:20:13.860
<v Speaker 5>Like Chris Ryan said it best.</v>

617
00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:14.551
<v Speaker 5>He was like,</v>

618
00:20:14.551 --> 00:20:16.890
<v Speaker 5>they're a fascist wearing hippie clothes.</v>

619
00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:17.490
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

620
00:20:17.490 --> 00:20:18.870
<v Speaker 5>They're wearing a hippie outfit.</v>

621
00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:19.230
<v Speaker 5>Yup.</v>

622
00:20:19.230 --> 00:20:19.830
<v Speaker 5>And there's,</v>

623
00:20:19.830 --> 00:20:20.760
<v Speaker 5>there's that too.</v>

624
00:20:21.150 --> 00:20:21.900
<v Speaker 5>But what it,</v>

625
00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:26.900
<v Speaker 5>what we're learning from all of this is that we know more about what's going on</v>

626
00:20:28.410 --> 00:20:32.040
<v Speaker 5>and we know more about where we're headed than we've ever known before.</v>

627
00:20:32.190 --> 00:20:35.610
<v Speaker 5>But yet we're still completely in the dark as to where this thing could.</v>

628
00:20:35.930 --> 00:20:36.500
<v Speaker 4>That's right.</v>

629
00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:37.790
<v Speaker 4>We don't know where it could go,</v>

630
00:20:37.850 --> 00:20:42.850
<v Speaker 4>but we are the midwives of the thing and that's the frustration is here we are.</v>

631
00:20:43.190 --> 00:20:44.210
<v Speaker 4>All of us are,</v>

632
00:20:44.270 --> 00:20:48.120
<v Speaker 4>are either via our attention or some people like Rick Doblin and,</v>

633
00:20:48.121 --> 00:20:53.121
<v Speaker 4>and the work they're actually doing or our Kurzweil or Musk or any of the</v>

634
00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:58.860
<v Speaker 4>luminaries who are at actively transforming society with their technological</v>

635
00:20:59.051 --> 00:20:59.884
<v Speaker 4>innovation.</v>

636
00:20:59.950 --> 00:21:03.430
<v Speaker 4>These are midwives and they're their rue drawing this thing out there,</v>

637
00:21:03.431 --> 00:21:08.110
<v Speaker 4>letting this thing be born and while they're letting this thing be born in what</v>

638
00:21:08.111 --> 00:21:10.450
<v Speaker 4>is being born is you can call it whatever you want.</v>

639
00:21:10.810 --> 00:21:12.220
<v Speaker 4>You can call it a renaissance,</v>

640
00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:14.340
<v Speaker 4>you can call it the tech,</v>

641
00:21:14.650 --> 00:21:15.850
<v Speaker 4>no messiah,</v>

642
00:21:16.030 --> 00:21:17.470
<v Speaker 4>you can call it whatever you want to call it.</v>

643
00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:22.570
<v Speaker 4>But this thing being born has not existed as far as we're aware on this planet.</v>

644
00:21:22.571 --> 00:21:23.051
<v Speaker 4>And if it did,</v>

645
00:21:23.051 --> 00:21:25.870
<v Speaker 4>it was before one of those meteorite impacts.</v>

646
00:21:25.870 --> 00:21:27.040
<v Speaker 4>You talk about some time,</v>

647
00:21:27.250 --> 00:21:32.250
<v Speaker 4>but here we are delivering this thing and end the fucking delivery room in this</v>

648
00:21:32.351 --> 00:21:37.351
<v Speaker 4>incredible period in human history where we're looking at complete control over</v>

649
00:21:37.451 --> 00:21:38.500
<v Speaker 4>our genetics,</v>

650
00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:41.740
<v Speaker 4>solving some of the world's greatest problems solving,</v>

651
00:21:41.741 --> 00:21:43.660
<v Speaker 4>like curing diseases,</v>

652
00:21:44.020 --> 00:21:44.291
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

653
00:21:44.291 --> 00:21:46.060
<v Speaker 4>that we thought we never could cure.</v>

654
00:21:46.330 --> 00:21:50.950
<v Speaker 4>There's like assholes throwing firecrackers in the fucking delivery room,</v>

655
00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:55.180
<v Speaker 4>yapping about some invisible angry guy that,</v>

656
00:21:55.181 --> 00:21:55.690
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

657
00:21:55.690 --> 00:21:57.460
<v Speaker 4>the hates gay people.</v>

658
00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:00.370
<v Speaker 4>And that's really frustrating because you're,</v>

659
00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:02.620
<v Speaker 4>you're witnessing,</v>

660
00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:03.543
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

661
00:22:03.620 --> 00:22:06.160
<v Speaker 4>the most radical form of violence,</v>

662
00:22:06.190 --> 00:22:07.420
<v Speaker 4>which is not just violence,</v>

663
00:22:07.450 --> 00:22:08.560
<v Speaker 4>human to human,</v>

664
00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:13.860
<v Speaker 4>but violence in the sense of trying to destroy the potentiality of our species</v>

665
00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:19.920
<v Speaker 4>by clinging to an antiquated and ridiculous notion of what God looks like.</v>

666
00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:21.783
<v Speaker 4>And that's,</v>

667
00:22:22.090 --> 00:22:24.850
<v Speaker 4>if there is anything more violent than that,</v>

668
00:22:24.851 --> 00:22:26.290
<v Speaker 4>I can't imagine what it could be.</v>

669
00:22:27.020 --> 00:22:27.201
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

670
00:22:27.201 --> 00:22:27.680
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

671
00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:30.140
<v Speaker 3>it's the most archaic evolve beliefs.</v>

672
00:22:30.410 --> 00:22:34.970
<v Speaker 3>The most archaic of all beliefs is this magic man that you've never met once you</v>

673
00:22:34.971 --> 00:22:36.620
<v Speaker 3>to kill people who don't believe in him.</v>

674
00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:37.120
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

675
00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:38.750
<v Speaker 3>That Dad's bananas.</v>

676
00:22:38.780 --> 00:22:39.410
<v Speaker 3>And this is,</v>

677
00:22:39.410 --> 00:22:43.280
<v Speaker 3>this is one of those things that just been around for long enough to get</v>

678
00:22:43.281 --> 00:22:45.650
<v Speaker 3>traction and it's become a normal part of life.</v>

679
00:22:45.651 --> 00:22:47.270
<v Speaker 3>But if you tried to introduce it today,</v>

680
00:22:47.630 --> 00:22:52.430
<v Speaker 3>if most people lived a secular life and you tried to introduce radical</v>

681
00:22:52.431 --> 00:22:54.230
<v Speaker 3>Christianity right today,</v>

682
00:22:54.260 --> 00:22:54.920
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

683
00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:58.580
<v Speaker 3>they would be one of the most ridiculous conversations you could ever have with</v>

684
00:22:58.581 --> 00:22:58.821
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

685
00:22:58.821 --> 00:22:59.351
<v Speaker 3>They would be the,</v>

686
00:22:59.351 --> 00:23:00.830
<v Speaker 3>the news would report on it,</v>

687
00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:01.190
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

688
00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:02.930
<v Speaker 3>It would be like they would talk about the effort.</v>

689
00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:05.270
<v Speaker 3>This strange new cult has come to town.</v>

690
00:23:05.271 --> 00:23:07.280
<v Speaker 3>Then once you believe that a,</v>

691
00:23:07.290 --> 00:23:09.760
<v Speaker 3>you were born from original sin and a,</v>

692
00:23:09.790 --> 00:23:11.180
<v Speaker 3>there's a man who died.</v>

693
00:23:11.180 --> 00:23:12.170
<v Speaker 3>They had a hammer him together.</v>

694
00:23:12.171 --> 00:23:12.981
<v Speaker 3>He was a son of God.</v>

695
00:23:12.981 --> 00:23:13.880
<v Speaker 3>They had a hammer him to,</v>

696
00:23:13.881 --> 00:23:16.280
<v Speaker 3>some would otherwise they couldn't fix the whole thing.</v>

697
00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:17.540
<v Speaker 3>There's no other way to do it.</v>

698
00:23:17.810 --> 00:23:18.680
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

699
00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:19.070
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

700
00:23:19.070 --> 00:23:22.610
<v Speaker 3>they wrote this stuff down back then and we just passed down from generation to</v>

701
00:23:22.611 --> 00:23:23.211
<v Speaker 3>generation.</v>

702
00:23:23.211 --> 00:23:24.680
<v Speaker 3>And then this is God's word and that's,</v>

703
00:23:24.681 --> 00:23:26.480
<v Speaker 3>that sounds like something,</v>

704
00:23:26.481 --> 00:23:27.470
<v Speaker 3>if it didn't exist,</v>

705
00:23:27.471 --> 00:23:29.840
<v Speaker 3>like if you're on the bus with someone and they started saying it,</v>

706
00:23:29.841 --> 00:23:31.160
<v Speaker 3>you'd switch seats because you're like,</v>

707
00:23:31.161 --> 00:23:31.761
<v Speaker 3>shit man,</v>

708
00:23:31.761 --> 00:23:33.710
<v Speaker 3>I sat next to the fucking crazy.</v>

709
00:23:33.711 --> 00:23:35.090
<v Speaker 3>But what was it?</v>

710
00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:35.950
<v Speaker 3>What,</v>

711
00:23:35.950 --> 00:23:37.640
<v Speaker 3>what do you think the original Bible was?</v>

712
00:23:37.850 --> 00:23:39.050
<v Speaker 4>The original Bible man?</v>

713
00:23:39.051 --> 00:23:43.970
<v Speaker 4>I think it was a transmission that was prepping the way for this thing that's</v>

714
00:23:43.971 --> 00:23:44.391
<v Speaker 4>coming.</v>

715
00:23:44.391 --> 00:23:45.140
<v Speaker 4>I think it,</v>

716
00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:45.590
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

717
00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:49.010
<v Speaker 4>one of the many in the same way you've got Ilan mosque in the same way you've</v>

718
00:23:49.011 --> 00:23:50.450
<v Speaker 4>got luminaries now,</v>

719
00:23:50.451 --> 00:23:54.320
<v Speaker 4>I think back then you add luminaries who are looking around at a world where</v>

720
00:23:54.321 --> 00:23:55.730
<v Speaker 4>people were barbaric,</v>

721
00:23:55.940 --> 00:23:58.040
<v Speaker 4>barbaric and getting crucified and they were like,</v>

722
00:23:58.041 --> 00:23:58.874
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

723
00:23:59.000 --> 00:23:59.241
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

724
00:23:59.241 --> 00:24:00.290
<v Speaker 4>look what they had to work with,</v>

725
00:24:00.291 --> 00:24:00.531
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

726
00:24:00.531 --> 00:24:01.730
<v Speaker 4>You have to start with like,</v>

727
00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:02.331
<v Speaker 4>hold on,</v>

728
00:24:02.331 --> 00:24:07.331
<v Speaker 4>maybe love your enemy as you love yourself or these ideas that are unifying</v>

729
00:24:08.690 --> 00:24:12.470
<v Speaker 4>these ideas that can create real peace because you need the piece.</v>

730
00:24:12.650 --> 00:24:15.740
<v Speaker 4>If you are looking at what's coming is the formation of a baby,</v>

731
00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:20.980
<v Speaker 4>then whatever early religion is propagating any kind of diminishment in war,</v>

732
00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:24.710
<v Speaker 4>any kind of,</v>

733
00:24:24.710 --> 00:24:27.230
<v Speaker 4>or even the attempt to reduce violence,</v>

734
00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:28.370
<v Speaker 4>then you're looking at this.</v>

735
00:24:28.371 --> 00:24:32.480
<v Speaker 4>It's kind of like trying to create the pod within which this thing can grow</v>

736
00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:33.830
<v Speaker 4>cause we need peace.</v>

737
00:24:33.831 --> 00:24:36.940
<v Speaker 4>We need stability in whatever way we can get get to.</v>

738
00:24:36.950 --> 00:24:37.100
<v Speaker 4>Now.</v>

739
00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:41.240
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying that the creators of the buy of the New Testament,</v>

740
00:24:41.570 --> 00:24:43.700
<v Speaker 4>the gospels were like,</v>

741
00:24:43.701 --> 00:24:44.031
<v Speaker 4>Shit,</v>

742
00:24:44.031 --> 00:24:44.241
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

743
00:24:44.241 --> 00:24:47.690
<v Speaker 4>we better come up with this ridiculous idea so that there can be robots in the</v>

744
00:24:47.691 --> 00:24:48.524
<v Speaker 4>future.</v>

745
00:24:50.210 --> 00:24:51.080
<v Speaker 4>But I think,</v>

746
00:24:51.290 --> 00:24:51.621
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

747
00:24:51.621 --> 00:24:52.161
<v Speaker 4>but that is,</v>

748
00:24:52.161 --> 00:24:53.180
<v Speaker 4>it's all the process,</v>

749
00:24:53.181 --> 00:24:53.330
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

750
00:24:53.330 --> 00:24:54.530
<v Speaker 4>It's part of the process,</v>

751
00:24:54.531 --> 00:24:56.180
<v Speaker 4>which is why it's so ironic.</v>

752
00:24:56.480 --> 00:24:58.190
<v Speaker 4>Did the people saying there's an invisible God,</v>

753
00:24:58.191 --> 00:24:59.600
<v Speaker 4>he wants him to kill other people.</v>

754
00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:00.520
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

755
00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:02.390
<v Speaker 4>they're there while they're doing all this.</v>

756
00:25:02.660 --> 00:25:07.660
<v Speaker 4>The actual God is in the birthing process in the laboratories and universities</v>

757
00:25:09.020 --> 00:25:10.730
<v Speaker 4>and think tanks of the,</v>

758
00:25:10.731 --> 00:25:11.564
<v Speaker 4>of the planet.</v>

759
00:25:11.630 --> 00:25:15.410
<v Speaker 4>It's oozing through the human imagination and manifesting.</v>

760
00:25:15.411 --> 00:25:18.110
<v Speaker 4>Is it all these high tech technologies that are,</v>

761
00:25:18.410 --> 00:25:20.720
<v Speaker 4>that have as one of their byproducts?</v>

762
00:25:20.721 --> 00:25:22.730
<v Speaker 4>The tendency to heal.</v>

763
00:25:22.940 --> 00:25:24.200
<v Speaker 4>You're talking about people,</v>

764
00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:25.370
<v Speaker 4>three d printing,</v>

765
00:25:25.371 --> 00:25:27.200
<v Speaker 4>they're fucking artificial limbs.</v>

766
00:25:27.201 --> 00:25:31.800
<v Speaker 4>Now think about that man that used to be so hard to get an an artificial limb is</v>

767
00:25:31.801 --> 00:25:32.900
<v Speaker 4>so expensive.</v>

768
00:25:33.110 --> 00:25:36.890
<v Speaker 4>Like now you could just print it out if that's what did Jesus do?</v>

769
00:25:37.430 --> 00:25:38.930
<v Speaker 4>He went around healing people.</v>

770
00:25:38.931 --> 00:25:40.940
<v Speaker 4>And you're seeing the very same thing.</v>

771
00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:42.830
<v Speaker 4>Like cancer is like the,</v>

772
00:25:42.860 --> 00:25:43.693
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

773
00:25:43.790 --> 00:25:44.121
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

774
00:25:44.121 --> 00:25:44.511
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

775
00:25:44.511 --> 00:25:45.110
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

776
00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:46.340
<v Speaker 4>cancer prognosis,</v>

777
00:25:46.460 --> 00:25:50.060
<v Speaker 4>at least in a lot of cases is much better than it ever has been.</v>

778
00:25:50.270 --> 00:25:53.810
<v Speaker 4>Not to mention the treatment of all the varieties of maladies that we have.</v>

779
00:25:53.811 --> 00:25:57.350
<v Speaker 4>I'm not like saying Western medicine is the ultimate thing,</v>

780
00:25:57.351 --> 00:26:01.640
<v Speaker 4>but it is helping people live longer and healing people.</v>

781
00:26:01.850 --> 00:26:02.683
<v Speaker 4>And it's in it.</v>

782
00:26:02.750 --> 00:26:04.580
<v Speaker 4>It can be a very beautiful force.</v>

783
00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:05.491
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

784
00:26:05.491 --> 00:26:08.150
<v Speaker 4>it also is an incredibly destructive force too,</v>

785
00:26:08.390 --> 00:26:10.120
<v Speaker 4>but it has a lot of wonderful byproducts.</v>

786
00:26:10.121 --> 00:26:15.121
<v Speaker 4>So I think that it's incredibly ironic that those folks can't see that they're</v>

787
00:26:15.621 --> 00:26:20.621
<v Speaker 4>looking for a god that was invented when the actual God is right in front of</v>

788
00:26:22.671 --> 00:26:23.504
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>

789
00:26:24.110 --> 00:26:24.943
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

790
00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:29.400
<v Speaker 4>and in all the high tech shit that we see scattered around this planet.</v>

791
00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:33.680
<v Speaker 4>Well it exists in the universe wanting us to create it.</v>

792
00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:38.580
<v Speaker 4>Whatever the fuck is inside of people that makes us want to breed and make</v>

793
00:26:38.581 --> 00:26:41.220
<v Speaker 4>buildings and keep pushing forward.</v>

794
00:26:42.030 --> 00:26:44.040
<v Speaker 4>It's also the same that gives us</v>

795
00:26:44.130 --> 00:26:48.180
<v Speaker 1>almost universally a desire for better shit all the time.</v>

796
00:26:48.510 --> 00:26:52.860
<v Speaker 1>Almost universally people are starting to be so entrenched into this idea of</v>

797
00:26:52.861 --> 00:26:56.280
<v Speaker 1>technological innovation that all the new shit,</v>

798
00:26:56.310 --> 00:26:56.580
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

799
00:26:56.580 --> 00:26:57.390
<v Speaker 1>they're up on it.</v>

800
00:26:57.390 --> 00:26:58.380
<v Speaker 1>They're talking about it.</v>

801
00:26:58.410 --> 00:26:59.370
<v Speaker 1>You hear what's going on.</v>

802
00:26:59.371 --> 00:26:59.671
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

803
00:26:59.671 --> 00:27:00.510
<v Speaker 1>Masters uh,</v>

804
00:27:00.690 --> 00:27:02.160
<v Speaker 1>creating a new laptop,</v>

805
00:27:02.161 --> 00:27:07.161
<v Speaker 1>master's going to get us a 15 inch with a visual optical drive.</v>

806
00:27:07.191 --> 00:27:12.150
<v Speaker 1>He reads your retina and plays the w w we were all like master has us,</v>

807
00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:14.280
<v Speaker 1>master is the machine that makes stuff.</v>

808
00:27:14.430 --> 00:27:17.580
<v Speaker 1>Master master master is the machine that makes stuff.</v>

809
00:27:17.820 --> 00:27:19.890
<v Speaker 1>And the more of a ball where you are,</v>

810
00:27:20.130 --> 00:27:21.830
<v Speaker 1>the more store flew gammas,</v>

811
00:27:21.850 --> 00:27:22.683
<v Speaker 1>stove,</v>

812
00:27:22.790 --> 00:27:27.790
<v Speaker 1>older stove and this idea that that's success and that's based on not happiness.</v>

813
00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:29.461
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

814
00:27:29.461 --> 00:27:33.220
<v Speaker 1>not the amount of positive interactions you have between loved one.</v>

815
00:27:33.270 --> 00:27:33.750
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>

816
00:27:33.750 --> 00:27:34.470
<v Speaker 1>Not that.</v>

817
00:27:34.470 --> 00:27:35.520
<v Speaker 1>Know what,</v>

818
00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:37.140
<v Speaker 1>how much shit you got,</v>

819
00:27:37.170 --> 00:27:38.760
<v Speaker 1>how many Zeros and ones,</v>

820
00:27:38.940 --> 00:27:43.710
<v Speaker 1>how much of a boost or you giving to this system that's trying to give birth to</v>

821
00:27:43.711 --> 00:27:44.850
<v Speaker 1>an artificial intelligence.</v>

822
00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:45.211
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

823
00:27:45.211 --> 00:27:45.931
<v Speaker 1>That's how much,</v>

824
00:27:45.931 --> 00:27:46.500
<v Speaker 1>how much money,</v>

825
00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:47.011
<v Speaker 1>how much money,</v>

826
00:27:47.011 --> 00:27:47.844
<v Speaker 1>how much houses,</v>

827
00:27:47.870 --> 00:27:48.331
<v Speaker 1>and just buy,</v>

828
00:27:48.331 --> 00:27:48.481
<v Speaker 1>buy,</v>

829
00:27:48.481 --> 00:27:48.601
<v Speaker 1>buy,</v>

830
00:27:48.601 --> 00:27:48.751
<v Speaker 1>buy,</v>

831
00:27:48.751 --> 00:27:48.871
<v Speaker 1>buy,</v>

832
00:27:48.871 --> 00:27:48.991
<v Speaker 1>buy,</v>

833
00:27:48.991 --> 00:27:49.520
<v Speaker 1>buy.</v>

834
00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:50.490
<v Speaker 1>You demand the best.</v>

835
00:27:50.491 --> 00:27:51.121
<v Speaker 1>You demand the best.</v>

836
00:27:51.121 --> 00:27:52.200
<v Speaker 1>We can reengineer it.</v>

837
00:27:52.290 --> 00:27:54.450
<v Speaker 1>We can make it better with a better model for Mr. Jones.</v>

838
00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:55.201
<v Speaker 1>Mr. Jones,</v>

839
00:27:55.201 --> 00:27:56.670
<v Speaker 1>was that the model that floats,</v>

840
00:27:56.820 --> 00:27:58.050
<v Speaker 1>let's make the bottle with a hoverboard.</v>

841
00:27:58.130 --> 00:27:59.130
<v Speaker 1>And before you know it,</v>

842
00:27:59.131 --> 00:28:00.600
<v Speaker 1>it's going further and further and further.</v>

843
00:28:00.601 --> 00:28:02.020
<v Speaker 1>And for almost all,</v>

844
00:28:02.021 --> 00:28:05.190
<v Speaker 1>it was fueled by this desire for Shit,</v>

845
00:28:05.590 --> 00:28:06.361
<v Speaker 1>materialism,</v>

846
00:28:06.361 --> 00:28:07.290
<v Speaker 1>market pressures,</v>

847
00:28:07.291 --> 00:28:08.124
<v Speaker 1>as it's called.</v>

848
00:28:08.250 --> 00:28:08.690
<v Speaker 1>And it,</v>

849
00:28:08.690 --> 00:28:11.520
<v Speaker 1>and it's cool to know that that's what's manifesting the thing.</v>

850
00:28:11.521 --> 00:28:12.030
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>

851
00:28:12.030 --> 00:28:13.680
<v Speaker 1>it's cool to recognize that the,</v>

852
00:28:14.010 --> 00:28:17.610
<v Speaker 1>whatever the womb of technology is,</v>

853
00:28:17.611 --> 00:28:18.030
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

854
00:28:18.030 --> 00:28:19.050
<v Speaker 1>it's using everything.</v>

855
00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:20.280
<v Speaker 1>It's using greed,</v>

856
00:28:20.490 --> 00:28:22.740
<v Speaker 1>it's using altruism,</v>

857
00:28:22.890 --> 00:28:25.470
<v Speaker 1>it's using creativity.</v>

858
00:28:25.471 --> 00:28:29.790
<v Speaker 1>It's using every little bit of nutrients that's floating around.</v>

859
00:28:29.791 --> 00:28:33.840
<v Speaker 1>Our paradigm is being absorbed into this being.</v>

860
00:28:33.841 --> 00:28:34.471
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

861
00:28:34.471 --> 00:28:35.630
<v Speaker 1>sometimes like bs,</v>

862
00:28:35.690 --> 00:28:35.940
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

863
00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:36.690
<v Speaker 1>Bees,</v>

864
00:28:36.690 --> 00:28:37.890
<v Speaker 1>they're working fucking hard,</v>

865
00:28:37.891 --> 00:28:38.161
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

866
00:28:38.161 --> 00:28:41.120
<v Speaker 1>They're out there getting Paulin.</v>

867
00:28:41.430 --> 00:28:41.990
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

868
00:28:41.990 --> 00:28:44.100
<v Speaker 1>and I know this is dumb cause they probably,</v>

869
00:28:44.101 --> 00:28:45.480
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how it be might think,</v>

870
00:28:45.900 --> 00:28:48.570
<v Speaker 1>but I bet that the B isn't thinking,</v>

871
00:28:49.350 --> 00:28:49.951
<v Speaker 1>fuck man,</v>

872
00:28:49.951 --> 00:28:51.810
<v Speaker 1>I've got to get more pollen for the fucking hive.</v>

873
00:28:51.811 --> 00:28:53.340
<v Speaker 1>I've got to do this man to work really hard.</v>

874
00:28:53.341 --> 00:28:54.300
<v Speaker 1>I think it's thinking,</v>

875
00:28:54.330 --> 00:28:58.270
<v Speaker 1>God flowers feel so good are all around inside of,</v>

876
00:28:58.290 --> 00:29:03.290
<v Speaker 1>I just love rolling around inside of flowers and I think in the same way humans</v>

877
00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:08.910
<v Speaker 1>when they're doing all these things that seem like recreation and leisure and</v>

878
00:29:08.911 --> 00:29:09.744
<v Speaker 1>hedonism,</v>

879
00:29:09.930 --> 00:29:10.830
<v Speaker 1>they don't realize it,</v>

880
00:29:11.010 --> 00:29:11.520
<v Speaker 1>but they're,</v>

881
00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:15.660
<v Speaker 1>they're building the machine to their building the machine by their desire for</v>

882
00:29:15.661 --> 00:29:19.860
<v Speaker 1>more heightened levels of hedonism for heightened levels of sense gratification,</v>

883
00:29:20.070 --> 00:29:24.210
<v Speaker 1>for heightened ability to express themselves or to bring what's in their mind</v>

884
00:29:24.211 --> 00:29:25.110
<v Speaker 1>out into the world.</v>

885
00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:30.320
<v Speaker 1>They're all worker bees that are helping to push forward the birth of,</v>

886
00:29:31.561 --> 00:29:31.990
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

887
00:29:31.990 --> 00:29:36.990
<v Speaker 1>of whatever this thing is that is currently fermenting in the womb of time.</v>

888
00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:40.440
<v Speaker 1>We're giving birth to a new thing.</v>

889
00:29:40.740 --> 00:29:42.160
<v Speaker 1>I think it's going to be a life form,</v>

890
00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:43.510
<v Speaker 3>but it's just not going to be a life form.</v>

891
00:29:43.511 --> 00:29:45.040
<v Speaker 3>Like the way we see life forms.</v>

892
00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:45.380
<v Speaker 3>We've,</v>

893
00:29:45.380 --> 00:29:49.660
<v Speaker 3>we have a very rigid idea of life forms and our life forms have to be alive.</v>

894
00:29:49.661 --> 00:29:50.500
<v Speaker 3>They have to have sex,</v>

895
00:29:50.501 --> 00:29:52.210
<v Speaker 3>they have to breed somehow or another,</v>

896
00:29:52.211 --> 00:29:55.810
<v Speaker 3>they have to replicate genetics through biological methods only.</v>

897
00:29:55.870 --> 00:29:56.620
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

898
00:29:56.620 --> 00:29:57.640
<v Speaker 3>And that's it.</v>

899
00:29:57.670 --> 00:30:01.840
<v Speaker 3>And then you have to have blood and bone or something really similar that we can</v>

900
00:30:01.841 --> 00:30:02.920
<v Speaker 3>map out and show the difference.</v>

901
00:30:02.921 --> 00:30:03.670
<v Speaker 3>Like a slug,</v>

902
00:30:03.670 --> 00:30:04.840
<v Speaker 3>like what exactly is slug,</v>

903
00:30:04.841 --> 00:30:07.020
<v Speaker 3>how it's got some weird skin thing.</v>

904
00:30:07.030 --> 00:30:07.900
<v Speaker 3>There's no bones.</v>

905
00:30:07.901 --> 00:30:08.141
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

906
00:30:08.141 --> 00:30:08.530
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

907
00:30:08.530 --> 00:30:08.741
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

908
00:30:08.741 --> 00:30:09.580
<v Speaker 3>But that's alive too.</v>

909
00:30:09.581 --> 00:30:10.390
<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>

910
00:30:10.390 --> 00:30:12.430
<v Speaker 3>And this is going to be a new thing.</v>

911
00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:13.660
<v Speaker 3>This is going to be a new thing,</v>

912
00:30:13.890 --> 00:30:14.620
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

913
00:30:14.620 --> 00:30:15.640
<v Speaker 3>And along the way,</v>

914
00:30:16.450 --> 00:30:18.040
<v Speaker 3>we're going to have some fucking bumps in the road.</v>

915
00:30:18.610 --> 00:30:19.690
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be real weird.</v>

916
00:30:19.810 --> 00:30:20.890
<v Speaker 4>There's going to be some bumps,</v>

917
00:30:20.891 --> 00:30:21.310
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

918
00:30:21.310 --> 00:30:24.490
<v Speaker 4>There's going to be some serious fucking pumps.</v>

919
00:30:24.610 --> 00:30:25.361
<v Speaker 4>No way around it.</v>

920
00:30:25.361 --> 00:30:26.050
<v Speaker 4>You ever,</v>

921
00:30:26.050 --> 00:30:26.400
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

922
00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:27.730
<v Speaker 4>20 I Terrence,</v>

923
00:30:27.731 --> 00:30:29.400
<v Speaker 4>I ever saw this great Mckenna Youtube here.</v>

924
00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:29.861
<v Speaker 4>Forgive me.</v>

925
00:30:29.861 --> 00:30:32.530
<v Speaker 4>Every time I come on your show on blab about him.</v>

926
00:30:32.531 --> 00:30:34.240
<v Speaker 4>But the God man,</v>

927
00:30:34.241 --> 00:30:39.241
<v Speaker 4>he gives this great description of what's happening is we approach this event,</v>

928
00:30:39.730 --> 00:30:41.840
<v Speaker 4>he compares it to a,</v>

929
00:30:41.850 --> 00:30:42.300
<v Speaker 4>like a,</v>

930
00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:42.510
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

931
00:30:42.510 --> 00:30:44.680
<v Speaker 4>an airplane accelerating.</v>

932
00:30:44.681 --> 00:30:46.720
<v Speaker 4>And the more you accelerate,</v>

933
00:30:46.721 --> 00:30:48.340
<v Speaker 4>the more turbulence you get.</v>

934
00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:50.620
<v Speaker 4>And so that's the,</v>

935
00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:55.330
<v Speaker 4>that as we like sort of exit the whatever the atmosphere is,</v>

936
00:30:55.331 --> 00:30:58.930
<v Speaker 4>if the current time period that we're existing in a move into this next place</v>

937
00:30:58.931 --> 00:31:00.340
<v Speaker 4>that they're calling the singularity,</v>

938
00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:01.990
<v Speaker 4>there's going to be some turbulence.</v>

939
00:31:01.991 --> 00:31:03.530
<v Speaker 4>There's going to be some bar,</v>

940
00:31:03.580 --> 00:31:05.290
<v Speaker 4>some serious fucking bumps,</v>

941
00:31:05.291 --> 00:31:05.591
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

942
00:31:05.591 --> 00:31:06.424
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

943
00:31:06.610 --> 00:31:07.031
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

944
00:31:07.031 --> 00:31:08.290
<v Speaker 4>there's gonna be bumps no matter what.</v>

945
00:31:08.620 --> 00:31:09.550
<v Speaker 4>If we don't do this,</v>

946
00:31:09.551 --> 00:31:10.420
<v Speaker 4>there's going to be bumps.</v>

947
00:31:10.570 --> 00:31:12.670
<v Speaker 4>If every scientist on earth was like,</v>

948
00:31:12.671 --> 00:31:13.420
<v Speaker 4>you know what,</v>

949
00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:14.890
<v Speaker 4>let's not work on AI.</v>

950
00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:17.320
<v Speaker 4>Let's not try to harness this power.</v>

951
00:31:17.590 --> 00:31:20.470
<v Speaker 4>Let's keep technology exactly where it is right now.</v>

952
00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:21.551
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

953
00:31:21.551 --> 00:31:22.384
<v Speaker 4>we're fucked.</v>

954
00:31:22.930 --> 00:31:23.800
<v Speaker 4>We're fucked.</v>

955
00:31:24.100 --> 00:31:25.450
<v Speaker 4>Then we're super fucked.</v>

956
00:31:25.540 --> 00:31:25.751
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

957
00:31:25.751 --> 00:31:26.710
<v Speaker 4>then we're just doomed.</v>

958
00:31:26.740 --> 00:31:29.410
<v Speaker 4>Like if all technology stopped advancing right now,</v>

959
00:31:29.470 --> 00:31:30.303
<v Speaker 4>how would we be fucked?</v>

960
00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:35.400
<v Speaker 4>Because the problems that are emerging right now are so fucking severe that the</v>

961
00:31:37.301 --> 00:31:38.620
<v Speaker 4>idea that human,</v>

962
00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:43.120
<v Speaker 4>a human being or human intelligence is going to be able to solve a lot of them</v>

963
00:31:43.510 --> 00:31:44.310
<v Speaker 4>is a,</v>

964
00:31:44.310 --> 00:31:46.270
<v Speaker 4>that's an optimistic idea.</v>

965
00:31:46.271 --> 00:31:47.740
<v Speaker 4>We're looking at ice caps,</v>

966
00:31:47.741 --> 00:31:48.790
<v Speaker 4>fucking melting.</v>

967
00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:51.610
<v Speaker 4>We're looking at people all over the world,</v>

968
00:31:51.940 --> 00:31:52.480
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

969
00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:56.470
<v Speaker 4>just out of control humping like people are,</v>

970
00:31:56.710 --> 00:31:57.543
<v Speaker 4>they're just,</v>

971
00:31:57.610 --> 00:31:58.443
<v Speaker 4>they're just,</v>

972
00:31:59.020 --> 00:31:59.351
<v Speaker 4>they're,</v>

973
00:31:59.351 --> 00:31:59.930
<v Speaker 4>they're,</v>

974
00:31:59.930 --> 00:32:04.930
<v Speaker 4>they're filling up policies with babies left and right.</v>

975
00:32:05.411 --> 00:32:06.580
<v Speaker 4>It's happening everywhere.</v>

976
00:32:06.581 --> 00:32:07.660
<v Speaker 4>No one's thinking about it,</v>

977
00:32:07.661 --> 00:32:07.890
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

978
00:32:07.890 --> 00:32:10.330
<v Speaker 4>You one year of water in California,</v>

979
00:32:10.660 --> 00:32:12.550
<v Speaker 4>one year of water in California,</v>

980
00:32:12.551 --> 00:32:14.830
<v Speaker 4>apparently one year of whatever that means.</v>

981
00:32:15.220 --> 00:32:16.031
<v Speaker 4>Guaranteed.</v>

982
00:32:16.031 --> 00:32:21.031
<v Speaker 4>Right now there's 50,000 people in California where there's sprinklers on full</v>

983
00:32:21.251 --> 00:32:24.340
<v Speaker 4>blast watching their sweet green yard.</v>

984
00:32:24.460 --> 00:32:26.830
<v Speaker 4>They know there's one year of water left in California.</v>

985
00:32:26.831 --> 00:32:27.071
<v Speaker 4>They're like,</v>

986
00:32:27.071 --> 00:32:27.910
<v Speaker 4>whatever,</v>

987
00:32:28.390 --> 00:32:29.140
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>

988
00:32:29.140 --> 00:32:29.980
<v Speaker 4>Here's the big one.</v>

989
00:32:30.490 --> 00:32:31.390
<v Speaker 4>Golf courses.</v>

990
00:32:31.630 --> 00:32:32.021
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

991
00:32:32.021 --> 00:32:33.520
<v Speaker 4>Those fucking golf courses</v>

992
00:32:33.580 --> 00:32:34.413
<v Speaker 3>play golf.</v>

993
00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:35.160
<v Speaker 3>If I did,</v>

994
00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:37.410
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure it'd be sympathetic and I'd be like,</v>

995
00:32:37.411 --> 00:32:37.621
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

996
00:32:37.621 --> 00:32:38.311
<v Speaker 3>I'm paying my money.</v>

997
00:32:38.311 --> 00:32:39.290
<v Speaker 3>I want my fucking water.</v>

998
00:32:39.380 --> 00:32:40.100
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>

999
00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:41.440
<v Speaker 5>Can they water the golf?</v>

1000
00:32:41.570 --> 00:32:42.403
<v Speaker 4>The Ocean?</v>

1001
00:32:42.410 --> 00:32:42.800
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

1002
00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:43.830
<v Speaker 4>Too Salty right now.</v>

1003
00:32:43.850 --> 00:32:45.430
<v Speaker 4>They can use reclaimed water,</v>

1004
00:32:45.460 --> 00:32:45.680
<v Speaker 4>water,</v>

1005
00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:46.513
<v Speaker 4>the golf.</v>

1006
00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:47.451
<v Speaker 4>So much.</v>

1007
00:32:47.451 --> 00:32:48.540
<v Speaker 4>I know about golf water,</v>

1008
00:32:48.740 --> 00:32:50.870
<v Speaker 4>the golf course course.</v>

1009
00:32:51.050 --> 00:32:52.430
<v Speaker 4>Can they do that with salt water?</v>

1010
00:32:52.810 --> 00:32:55.610
<v Speaker 4>Salt water is getting wrong is he's going to fuck up grass.</v>

1011
00:32:55.611 --> 00:32:59.570
<v Speaker 4>I think you need some nice pure clean water.</v>

1012
00:32:59.571 --> 00:33:01.370
<v Speaker 4>But I think that you can use reclaimed water.</v>

1013
00:33:01.371 --> 00:33:01.551
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1014
00:33:01.551 --> 00:33:03.020
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure there are solutions,</v>

1015
00:33:03.380 --> 00:33:04.220
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

1016
00:33:04.460 --> 00:33:07.100
<v Speaker 4>my point is we've got some serious uh,</v>

1017
00:33:07.130 --> 00:33:09.650
<v Speaker 4>difficulties facing us and um,</v>

1018
00:33:10.260 --> 00:33:10.580
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1019
00:33:10.580 --> 00:33:14.990
<v Speaker 4>a lot of this stuff that we need to fix some of these problems is that</v>

1020
00:33:14.991 --> 00:33:16.910
<v Speaker 4>technology doesn't quite exist yet,</v>

1021
00:33:17.180 --> 00:33:22.180
<v Speaker 4>but we do know that it's coming based on the very predictable acceleration</v>

1022
00:33:22.821 --> 00:33:23.654
<v Speaker 4>that's happening.</v>

1023
00:33:23.870 --> 00:33:24.703
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1024
00:33:24.740 --> 00:33:26.420
<v Speaker 4>did they call a Moore's law?</v>

1025
00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:27.261
<v Speaker 4>So we know,</v>

1026
00:33:27.261 --> 00:33:27.561
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1027
00:33:27.561 --> 00:33:32.561
<v Speaker 4>well we can kind of guesstimate how fast computers are going to be in 10 years</v>

1028
00:33:33.141 --> 00:33:34.400
<v Speaker 4>based on that concept.</v>

1029
00:33:34.730 --> 00:33:39.260
<v Speaker 4>And we can look at the problems that simulators currently are capable of</v>

1030
00:33:39.261 --> 00:33:40.094
<v Speaker 4>solving.</v>

1031
00:33:40.460 --> 00:33:40.821
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1032
00:33:40.821 --> 00:33:41.654
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>

1033
00:33:41.750 --> 00:33:46.100
<v Speaker 4>what kind of problems can a simulator that has the power of every human brain on</v>

1034
00:33:46.101 --> 00:33:46.960
<v Speaker 4>the planet sof?</v>

1035
00:33:47.330 --> 00:33:48.560
<v Speaker 4>If you ask that,</v>

1036
00:33:49.010 --> 00:33:49.280
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1037
00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:54.280
<v Speaker 4>how to deal with the ice caps melting or overpopulation or some disease running</v>

1038
00:33:56.211 --> 00:33:57.030
<v Speaker 4>rampant,</v>

1039
00:33:57.030 --> 00:33:58.980
<v Speaker 5>what would you think would be move number one?</v>

1040
00:33:59.010 --> 00:34:00.330
<v Speaker 5>What would you like if you,</v>

1041
00:34:00.990 --> 00:34:02.970
<v Speaker 5>if you wanted to deal with any of those issues?</v>

1042
00:34:03.210 --> 00:34:06.330
<v Speaker 5>I would think clean up the ocean is probably one of the first ones,</v>

1043
00:34:06.331 --> 00:34:07.164
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1044
00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:07.810
<v Speaker 5>Chart.</v>

1045
00:34:07.810 --> 00:34:09.060
<v Speaker 5>Stop chopping down the forest.</v>

1046
00:34:09.430 --> 00:34:10.290
<v Speaker 5>Clean up the oceans.</v>

1047
00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:10.620
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1048
00:34:10.620 --> 00:34:11.430
<v Speaker 5>Those are two huge,</v>

1049
00:34:11.430 --> 00:34:11.851
<v Speaker 5>huge islands,</v>

1050
00:34:11.851 --> 00:34:12.060
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1051
00:34:12.060 --> 00:34:14.760
<v Speaker 5>That's like a kid who like wants to go play outside,</v>

1052
00:34:14.761 --> 00:34:17.220
<v Speaker 5>but you have shit all over your bedroom walls.</v>

1053
00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:17.530
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1054
00:34:17.530 --> 00:34:18.720
<v Speaker 5>You just shit on your wall.</v>

1055
00:34:18.721 --> 00:34:20.790
<v Speaker 5>It's like what do you do when you got to know you've got to clean this up.</v>

1056
00:34:20.791 --> 00:34:21.624
<v Speaker 5>You fuck,</v>

1057
00:34:21.630 --> 00:34:22.680
<v Speaker 5>you can't just keep going.</v>

1058
00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:23.580
<v Speaker 5>That's right.</v>

1059
00:34:23.580 --> 00:34:27.390
<v Speaker 5>We've made this big mess of the ocean and the F and everyone's like,</v>

1060
00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:28.051
<v Speaker 5>God,</v>

1061
00:34:28.051 --> 00:34:28.770
<v Speaker 5>I didn't do it.</v>

1062
00:34:28.770 --> 00:34:29.603
<v Speaker 5>I didn't do it.</v>

1063
00:34:29.850 --> 00:34:31.050
<v Speaker 5>Nobody wants to say they did it.</v>

1064
00:34:31.051 --> 00:34:31.201
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

1065
00:34:31.201 --> 00:34:35.400
<v Speaker 5>nobody wants to look at that chuge fucking patch of garbage that's floating</v>

1066
00:34:35.401 --> 00:34:38.160
<v Speaker 5>around the Pacific Ocean that all these scientists are terrified of.</v>

1067
00:34:38.250 --> 00:34:38.550
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1068
00:34:38.550 --> 00:34:40.140
<v Speaker 5>Nobody wants to like look at that and go,</v>

1069
00:34:40.141 --> 00:34:40.381
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

1070
00:34:40.381 --> 00:34:40.591
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

1071
00:34:40.591 --> 00:34:40.801
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

1072
00:34:40.801 --> 00:34:41.041
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

1073
00:34:41.041 --> 00:34:41.730
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

1074
00:34:41.730 --> 00:34:42.150
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>

1075
00:34:42.150 --> 00:34:43.260
<v Speaker 5>We did a little bit.</v>

1076
00:34:43.261 --> 00:34:44.071
<v Speaker 5>You did a little bit.</v>

1077
00:34:44.071 --> 00:34:44.701
<v Speaker 5>Let's chip in.</v>

1078
00:34:44.701 --> 00:34:45.534
<v Speaker 5>We got to do this.</v>

1079
00:34:45.640 --> 00:34:46.860
<v Speaker 5>We've got to fix this first.</v>

1080
00:34:46.861 --> 00:34:47.400
<v Speaker 5>Like nobody,</v>

1081
00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:48.233
<v Speaker 5>nobody wants.</v>

1082
00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:48.421
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1083
00:34:48.421 --> 00:34:49.380
<v Speaker 4>nobody wants,</v>

1084
00:34:49.410 --> 00:34:52.290
<v Speaker 4>I mean the problem is nobody wants to do,</v>

1085
00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:53.310
<v Speaker 4>I mean just say no,</v>

1086
00:34:53.311 --> 00:34:54.180
<v Speaker 4>but I want to say no.</v>

1087
00:34:54.181 --> 00:34:55.560
<v Speaker 4>Governments want to do that.</v>

1088
00:34:55.590 --> 00:34:55.771
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1089
00:34:55.771 --> 00:34:56.011
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1090
00:34:56.011 --> 00:34:57.030
<v Speaker 4>I mean fuck that.</v>

1091
00:34:57.070 --> 00:34:58.470
<v Speaker 4>How about November one two?</v>

1092
00:34:58.530 --> 00:34:58.741
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1093
00:34:58.741 --> 00:35:00.180
<v Speaker 4>I mean I think people want to,</v>

1094
00:35:00.970 --> 00:35:02.020
<v Speaker 5>people that are super concerned,</v>

1095
00:35:02.021 --> 00:35:02.291
<v Speaker 5>they just,</v>

1096
00:35:02.291 --> 00:35:04.090
<v Speaker 5>I don't think they have the funds or the,</v>

1097
00:35:04.120 --> 00:35:05.070
<v Speaker 5>maybe the,</v>

1098
00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:05.681
<v Speaker 5>the means.</v>

1099
00:35:05.681 --> 00:35:06.970
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if there's a physical,</v>

1100
00:35:07.730 --> 00:35:08.940
<v Speaker 4>that's what we need that.</v>

1101
00:35:08.941 --> 00:35:09.081
<v Speaker 4>See,</v>

1102
00:35:09.081 --> 00:35:12.890
<v Speaker 4>that's part of what technology can do is it can connect people.</v>

1103
00:35:12.891 --> 00:35:13.750
<v Speaker 4>I mean look at what it,</v>

1104
00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:16.010
<v Speaker 4>how great it is it raising money.</v>

1105
00:35:16.250 --> 00:35:21.250
<v Speaker 4>Look at how powerful it is when it comes to any kind of goal that you want as a</v>

1106
00:35:21.471 --> 00:35:22.250
<v Speaker 4>society.</v>

1107
00:35:22.250 --> 00:35:26.540
<v Speaker 4>Just what you were saying is like a lot of us are so brainwashed that we think,</v>

1108
00:35:26.990 --> 00:35:27.321
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1109
00:35:27.321 --> 00:35:29.450
<v Speaker 4>I hope the government handles this problem,</v>

1110
00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:33.590
<v Speaker 4>but the governments aren't the ones who are going to be transforming the earth.</v>

1111
00:35:33.591 --> 00:35:38.591
<v Speaker 4>It's going to be the super connected citizens who are using technology to</v>

1112
00:35:38.821 --> 00:35:43.020
<v Speaker 4>manifest their will and hopefully positive ways.</v>

1113
00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:45.571
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1114
00:35:45.571 --> 00:35:46.620
<v Speaker 4>there's gotta be,</v>

1115
00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:47.940
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

1116
00:35:47.940 --> 00:35:52.940
<v Speaker 4>there's going to be no way in the next five years to put a lid on this thing.</v>

1117
00:35:54.270 --> 00:35:54.571
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1118
00:35:54.571 --> 00:35:54.930
<v Speaker 4>on,</v>

1119
00:35:54.930 --> 00:35:55.440
<v Speaker 4>on the,</v>

1120
00:35:55.440 --> 00:35:55.981
<v Speaker 4>on the,</v>

1121
00:35:55.981 --> 00:35:57.090
<v Speaker 4>on the spread of technology.</v>

1122
00:35:57.120 --> 00:35:57.781
<v Speaker 4>Oh fuck.</v>

1123
00:35:57.781 --> 00:35:59.400
<v Speaker 4>Now you can't stop it.</v>

1124
00:35:59.520 --> 00:35:59.761
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1125
00:35:59.761 --> 00:36:00.330
<v Speaker 4>that's a verdict.</v>

1126
00:36:00.330 --> 00:36:00.691
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's,</v>

1127
00:36:00.691 --> 00:36:05.360
<v Speaker 4>if everyone might as well just give up the idea that in some way this thing is,</v>

1128
00:36:05.361 --> 00:36:09.630
<v Speaker 4>is being stopped and everyone just has to accept the fact that this stuff is</v>

1129
00:36:09.631 --> 00:36:11.790
<v Speaker 4>coming and also accept the fact that,</v>

1130
00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:12.390
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1131
00:36:12.390 --> 00:36:15.120
<v Speaker 4>the world is a fuck load better than a lot of people think.</v>

1132
00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:16.500
<v Speaker 4>And that's big.</v>

1133
00:36:16.650 --> 00:36:17.670
<v Speaker 4>And that's a big,</v>

1134
00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:19.440
<v Speaker 4>big shift that needs to happen.</v>

1135
00:36:19.441 --> 00:36:19.621
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1136
00:36:19.621 --> 00:36:20.190
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>

1137
00:36:20.190 --> 00:36:20.491
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1138
00:36:20.491 --> 00:36:22.080
<v Speaker 4>even as we figure it out,</v>

1139
00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:26.160
<v Speaker 4>deal with the oceans or any great problem facing us,</v>

1140
00:36:26.490 --> 00:36:31.490
<v Speaker 4>there also needs to be a deep and a prolonged ener,</v>

1141
00:36:33.570 --> 00:36:33.930
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1142
00:36:33.930 --> 00:36:37.320
<v Speaker 4>work that people need to be having with themselves because we are a,</v>

1143
00:36:37.321 --> 00:36:40.380
<v Speaker 4>Migdal Ezer going fucking nuts right now.</v>

1144
00:36:40.530 --> 00:36:41.363
<v Speaker 4>Have you seen this?</v>

1145
00:36:42.060 --> 00:36:42.840
<v Speaker 4>Oh Wow.</v>

1146
00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:43.440
<v Speaker 4>Have you seen this?</v>

1147
00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:43.591
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

1148
00:36:43.591 --> 00:36:44.730
<v Speaker 4>This is a new robot.</v>

1149
00:36:44.850 --> 00:36:45.391
<v Speaker 4>Look at this.</v>

1150
00:36:45.391 --> 00:36:45.870
<v Speaker 4>You want to shut,</v>

1151
00:36:45.870 --> 00:36:47.070
<v Speaker 4>your parents are going to shit your pants.</v>

1152
00:36:47.370 --> 00:36:47.551
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1153
00:36:47.551 --> 00:36:48.060
<v Speaker 4>I've seen that.</v>

1154
00:36:48.060 --> 00:36:48.990
<v Speaker 4>I've seen that Gao.</v>

1155
00:36:49.260 --> 00:36:49.441
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1156
00:36:49.441 --> 00:36:50.060
<v Speaker 4>I've seen that one.</v>

1157
00:36:50.060 --> 00:36:52.990
<v Speaker 4>Like a Japanese new robot that they've created.</v>

1158
00:36:52.991 --> 00:36:55.920
<v Speaker 4>It's a woman and it will blow your fucking mind.</v>

1159
00:36:55.950 --> 00:36:59.280
<v Speaker 4>You think you're being taken and I'll do more than blow your mind.</v>

1160
00:37:01.090 --> 00:37:01.923
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>

1161
00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:08.730
<v Speaker 4>It's the craziest looking robot I have ever seen in my life.</v>

1162
00:37:08.790 --> 00:37:09.870
<v Speaker 4>It's very realistic.</v>

1163
00:37:09.871 --> 00:37:11.580
<v Speaker 4>So really super realistic.</v>

1164
00:37:11.630 --> 00:37:11.810
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>

1165
00:37:11.810 --> 00:37:16.810
<v Speaker 4>the youtube video is titled Very Real Looking robot and it's one of those,</v>

1166
00:37:17.881 --> 00:37:18.600
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1167
00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:21.270
<v Speaker 4>it's one of those breakthroughs where you look at it and just go,</v>

1168
00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:22.200
<v Speaker 4>oh wow.</v>

1169
00:37:22.201 --> 00:37:23.370
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know they were that far.</v>

1170
00:37:23.490 --> 00:37:23.860
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1171
00:37:23.860 --> 00:37:24.071
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1172
00:37:24.071 --> 00:37:25.320
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know they had got that far.</v>

1173
00:37:25.550 --> 00:37:26.011
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

1174
00:37:26.011 --> 00:37:26.251
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

1175
00:37:26.251 --> 00:37:27.050
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

1176
00:37:27.050 --> 00:37:27.600
<v Speaker 4>that's cool,</v>

1177
00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:28.710
<v Speaker 4>that's fucking cool.</v>

1178
00:37:28.860 --> 00:37:29.550
<v Speaker 4>And that,</v>

1179
00:37:29.550 --> 00:37:29.950
<v Speaker 4>that's a,</v>

1180
00:37:29.950 --> 00:37:30.960
<v Speaker 4>that's an amazing,</v>

1181
00:37:30.961 --> 00:37:31.950
<v Speaker 4>amazing thing.</v>

1182
00:37:32.310 --> 00:37:32.970
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1183
00:37:32.970 --> 00:37:35.100
<v Speaker 4>and that's nothing compared and you know,</v>

1184
00:37:35.101 --> 00:37:37.470
<v Speaker 4>that humanoid robot thing that everyone's sort of,</v>

1185
00:37:37.530 --> 00:37:39.210
<v Speaker 4>we've envisioned is what it is.</v>

1186
00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:42.180
<v Speaker 4>That's really like just one little piece of,</v>

1187
00:37:42.181 --> 00:37:44.190
<v Speaker 4>of what we've got coming down the pipes.</v>

1188
00:37:44.600 --> 00:37:45.433
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1189
00:37:45.480 --> 00:37:48.060
<v Speaker 4>and the other interesting thing to think about is those,</v>

1190
00:37:48.620 --> 00:37:49.200
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1191
00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:50.070
<v Speaker 4>beings,</v>

1192
00:37:50.100 --> 00:37:55.100
<v Speaker 4>the robots are going to be vessels within which the AI will exist because the AI</v>

1193
00:37:57.541 --> 00:37:59.370
<v Speaker 4>is going to exist in the cloud.</v>

1194
00:37:59.550 --> 00:38:04.550
<v Speaker 4>So what's really curious is that we will have this new kind of wind blowing</v>

1195
00:38:04.981 --> 00:38:06.420
<v Speaker 4>through the world.</v>

1196
00:38:06.421 --> 00:38:08.010
<v Speaker 4>It's the wind of the cloud,</v>

1197
00:38:08.011 --> 00:38:08.520
<v Speaker 4>of all the,</v>

1198
00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:13.520
<v Speaker 4>all the data that is now become personified or personalized by some artificial</v>

1199
00:38:13.711 --> 00:38:16.710
<v Speaker 4>intelligence and that data whenever it wants to,</v>

1200
00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:20.880
<v Speaker 4>we'll be able to pop in to open a portals,</v>

1201
00:38:21.510 --> 00:38:22.680
<v Speaker 4>which will be robots.</v>

1202
00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:27.410
<v Speaker 4>So robots or cars for artificial intelligence and artificial intelligence isn't</v>

1203
00:38:27.420 --> 00:38:29.550
<v Speaker 4>going to be localized inside the robot.</v>

1204
00:38:29.790 --> 00:38:30.780
<v Speaker 4>That's what we all think.</v>

1205
00:38:30.781 --> 00:38:31.021
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1206
00:38:31.021 --> 00:38:31.470
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

1207
00:38:31.470 --> 00:38:34.020
<v Speaker 4>you go to the robot and you like ask it the right question.</v>

1208
00:38:34.021 --> 00:38:37.060
<v Speaker 4>It's eyes bulge out and smoke comes out and you beat the robot.</v>

1209
00:38:37.630 --> 00:38:39.580
<v Speaker 4>That's now it works it on the robot.</v>

1210
00:38:41.140 --> 00:38:42.160
<v Speaker 4>The fucking image.</v>

1211
00:38:42.300 --> 00:38:42.551
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1212
00:38:42.551 --> 00:38:43.211
<v Speaker 4>That's the image.</v>

1213
00:38:43.211 --> 00:38:44.620
<v Speaker 4>So bugs bunny cartoon or something.</v>

1214
00:38:44.621 --> 00:38:44.921
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1215
00:38:44.921 --> 00:38:46.180
<v Speaker 4>it's from Star Trek.</v>

1216
00:38:46.181 --> 00:38:46.471
<v Speaker 4>You're like,</v>

1217
00:38:46.471 --> 00:38:46.991
<v Speaker 4>good God.</v>

1218
00:38:46.991 --> 00:38:49.330
<v Speaker 4>Make a rock so big he can't move it.</v>

1219
00:38:49.331 --> 00:38:51.740
<v Speaker 4>And the robot White Palau it explicitly.</v>

1220
00:38:51.910 --> 00:38:52.720
<v Speaker 4>That was star Trek.</v>

1221
00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:53.200
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1222
00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:54.070
<v Speaker 4>that wasn't the question,</v>

1223
00:38:54.071 --> 00:38:58.270
<v Speaker 4>but there are the ideas you can malfunction or an AI if you ask it the right</v>

1224
00:38:58.271 --> 00:38:58.810
<v Speaker 4>question.</v>

1225
00:38:58.810 --> 00:38:59.770
<v Speaker 4>That's a perfect one.</v>

1226
00:39:00.190 --> 00:39:02.950
<v Speaker 4>If God can God make a rock so big that even he couldn't move it.</v>

1227
00:39:02.960 --> 00:39:03.370
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1228
00:39:03.370 --> 00:39:04.203
<v Speaker 4>that's a good one.</v>

1229
00:39:04.270 --> 00:39:04.660
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1230
00:39:04.660 --> 00:39:04.881
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

1231
00:39:04.881 --> 00:39:06.930
<v Speaker 4>it's like the robot can handle that.</v>

1232
00:39:06.950 --> 00:39:08.230
<v Speaker 4>You handle it can of pop.</v>

1233
00:39:08.590 --> 00:39:09.490
<v Speaker 4>That's what we think.</v>

1234
00:39:09.670 --> 00:39:10.840
<v Speaker 4>That's how you fight these things.</v>

1235
00:39:13.870 --> 00:39:15.520
<v Speaker 4>But the riddles riddles</v>

1236
00:39:18.790 --> 00:39:20.340
<v Speaker 4>fight the Robo with a real,</v>

1237
00:39:20.750 --> 00:39:21.583
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1238
00:39:21.750 --> 00:39:22.030
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

1239
00:39:22.030 --> 00:39:22.331
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

1240
00:39:22.331 --> 00:39:23.720
<v Speaker 4>but you see you're,</v>

1241
00:39:23.721 --> 00:39:25.060
<v Speaker 4>you're talking about this,</v>

1242
00:39:25.061 --> 00:39:25.360
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1243
00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:25.571
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1244
00:39:25.571 --> 00:39:30.571
<v Speaker 4>it's very similar to a lot of mystical conceptualizations of way human life is,</v>

1245
00:39:30.791 --> 00:39:35.791
<v Speaker 4>which is that human beings are antennas for a transcendent intelligence that</v>

1246
00:39:38.050 --> 00:39:43.050
<v Speaker 4>tunes in to the specific genetic code that is inside of every person.</v>

1247
00:39:43.061 --> 00:39:46.840
<v Speaker 4>That unique code is like a radio station that the,</v>

1248
00:39:47.100 --> 00:39:47.560
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1249
00:39:47.560 --> 00:39:50.140
<v Speaker 4>vast supernatural,</v>

1250
00:39:50.590 --> 00:39:55.590
<v Speaker 4>undiscovered transcendent cloud of consciousness that they used to call God</v>

1251
00:39:56.320 --> 00:39:58.240
<v Speaker 4>tunes into or is channeled through.</v>

1252
00:39:58.450 --> 00:39:59.920
<v Speaker 4>It's the same idea with robots.</v>

1253
00:39:59.921 --> 00:40:04.720
<v Speaker 4>The idea will be there will be this AI existing in the cloud that whenever it</v>

1254
00:40:04.721 --> 00:40:05.201
<v Speaker 4>wants to,</v>

1255
00:40:05.201 --> 00:40:06.790
<v Speaker 4>we'll be able to pop into a,</v>

1256
00:40:06.791 --> 00:40:07.070
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1257
00:40:07.070 --> 00:40:07.903
<v Speaker 4>a machine.</v>

1258
00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:09.661
<v Speaker 6>What's that sound?</v>

1259
00:40:09.661 --> 00:40:11.430
<v Speaker 6>Is that a car alarm?</v>

1260
00:40:14.060 --> 00:40:14.451
<v Speaker 4>It's weird.</v>

1261
00:40:14.451 --> 00:40:16.310
<v Speaker 4>It's coming through that you hear in the headphones.</v>

1262
00:40:16.311 --> 00:40:16.860
<v Speaker 4>It sounds,</v>

1263
00:40:16.860 --> 00:40:17.693
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1264
00:40:17.900 --> 00:40:18.733
<v Speaker 6>it's freaking me out.</v>

1265
00:40:20.150 --> 00:40:20.560
<v Speaker 6>Cheeses.</v>

1266
00:40:20.560 --> 00:40:21.393
<v Speaker 6>Chamie</v>

1267
00:40:22.130 --> 00:40:22.611
<v Speaker 3>what could it be?</v>

1268
00:40:22.611 --> 00:40:24.260
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it's a toilet overflowing.</v>

1269
00:40:25.020 --> 00:40:26.670
<v Speaker 6>There's a car alarm going off.</v>

1270
00:40:26.700 --> 00:40:27.750
<v Speaker 6>Hopefully it's not yours.</v>

1271
00:40:28.260 --> 00:40:29.093
<v Speaker 6>I don't</v>

1272
00:40:29.340 --> 00:40:30.001
<v Speaker 4>thank my car.</v>

1273
00:40:30.001 --> 00:40:31.500
<v Speaker 4>The government man,</v>

1274
00:40:31.560 --> 00:40:33.030
<v Speaker 4>they don't want us to talk about this.</v>

1275
00:40:33.031 --> 00:40:33.571
<v Speaker 4>They love it.</v>

1276
00:40:33.571 --> 00:40:34.404
<v Speaker 4>The government loves us,</v>

1277
00:40:34.530 --> 00:40:36.510
<v Speaker 4>you know they do.</v>

1278
00:40:36.750 --> 00:40:38.370
<v Speaker 4>The military loves this shit.</v>

1279
00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:39.300
<v Speaker 4>That's one of the,</v>

1280
00:40:39.540 --> 00:40:43.410
<v Speaker 4>that's one of the engine's pushing this thing next door alarm.</v>

1281
00:40:45.430 --> 00:40:46.660
<v Speaker 3>Sorry Ladies and gentlemen.</v>

1282
00:40:48.100 --> 00:40:50.980
<v Speaker 3>Do you think Dee Dee is really a conscious effort?</v>

1283
00:40:50.981 --> 00:40:52.660
<v Speaker 3>Like people love what's going on,</v>

1284
00:40:52.661 --> 00:40:56.410
<v Speaker 3>like they actually enjoy it or do you think that it's just this inevitable thing</v>

1285
00:40:56.411 --> 00:40:58.600
<v Speaker 3>that people are trying to profit off of in one way or another?</v>

1286

<v Speaker 3>business.</v>

1291
00:41:08.831 --> 00:41:10.150
<v Speaker 3>Like that's how we would like to look at.</v>

1292
00:41:10.390 --> 00:41:10.750
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1293
00:41:10.750 --> 00:41:11.920
<v Speaker 4>they love chaos.</v>

1294
00:41:11.930 --> 00:41:14.470
<v Speaker 4>Stay level profit off of it.</v>

1295
00:41:15.140 --> 00:41:16.480
<v Speaker 4>Oh God.</v>

1296
00:41:16.481 --> 00:41:17.980
<v Speaker 4>If only it were that easy.</v>

1297
00:41:18.210 --> 00:41:18.580
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

1298
00:41:18.580 --> 00:41:20.000
<v Speaker 4>it's just not that easy man there.</v>

1299
00:41:20.001 --> 00:41:20.321
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

1300
00:41:20.321 --> 00:41:20.830
<v Speaker 4>when I,</v>

1301
00:41:20.830 --> 00:41:22.960
<v Speaker 4>I just interviewed Doblin and he's talking about,</v>

1302
00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:23.621
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1303
00:41:23.621 --> 00:41:28.621
<v Speaker 4>going into the Pentagon to talk about using Mtma to treat PTSD with these high</v>

1304
00:41:28.631 --> 00:41:33.190
<v Speaker 4>level people and they're not like you to Hippie Juror Aggie.</v>

1305
00:41:33.210 --> 00:41:33.980
<v Speaker 4>They're like,</v>

1306
00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:34.371
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1307
00:41:34.371 --> 00:41:34.761
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

1308
00:41:34.761 --> 00:41:39.020
<v Speaker 1>I think we understand what you're saying and that's kind of stunning when you</v>

1309
00:41:39.021 --> 00:41:39.980
<v Speaker 1>realize that this,</v>

1310
00:41:40.010 --> 00:41:40.843
<v Speaker 1>that that,</v>

1311
00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:41.380
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1312
00:41:41.380 --> 00:41:44.500
<v Speaker 1>that you can't demonize all facets of,</v>

1313
00:41:44.540 --> 00:41:45.291
<v Speaker 1>of the government.</v>

1314
00:41:45.291 --> 00:41:50.291
<v Speaker 1>There are people in parts of the government that must be an awful nefarious,</v>

1315
00:41:51.201 --> 00:41:52.220
<v Speaker 1>greedy fucks,</v>

1316
00:41:52.460 --> 00:41:56.480
<v Speaker 1>but also in there there's great people who really want the world to be better</v>

1317
00:41:56.630 --> 00:41:59.030
<v Speaker 1>and to think that just because you end up at with a government job,</v>

1318
00:41:59.240 --> 00:42:02.510
<v Speaker 1>he therefore means you're evil is the most ridiculous,</v>

1319
00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:04.460
<v Speaker 1>stupid idea of all time.</v>

1320
00:42:04.461 --> 00:42:04.971
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't,</v>

1321
00:42:04.971 --> 00:42:05.781
<v Speaker 1>it's a lot of people,</v>

1322
00:42:05.781 --> 00:42:06.320
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1323
00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:07.220
<v Speaker 1>they actually want to,</v>

1324
00:42:08.630 --> 00:42:10.400
<v Speaker 1>they're not like us.</v>

1325
00:42:10.670 --> 00:42:11.660
<v Speaker 1>Like we're comedians.</v>

1326
00:42:11.661 --> 00:42:15.020
<v Speaker 1>We enjoy telling jokes and we have a podcast and I think we both have our own</v>

1327
00:42:15.021 --> 00:42:16.520
<v Speaker 1>desire to like help the world,</v>

1328
00:42:16.850 --> 00:42:18.410
<v Speaker 1>but some people,</v>

1329
00:42:18.500 --> 00:42:23.030
<v Speaker 1>they want to help the world so fucking bad that through high school they</v>

1330
00:42:23.031 --> 00:42:23.870
<v Speaker 1>volunteer,</v>

1331
00:42:24.050 --> 00:42:25.250
<v Speaker 1>they get out of high school,</v>

1332
00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:26.510
<v Speaker 1>go to fucking college,</v>

1333
00:42:26.540 --> 00:42:30.740
<v Speaker 1>joined the Peace Corps and they give their entire lives up,</v>

1334
00:42:31.100 --> 00:42:33.770
<v Speaker 1>making very little money to try to help people.</v>

1335
00:42:33.770 --> 00:42:34.431
<v Speaker 1>And those people,</v>

1336
00:42:34.431 --> 00:42:37.640
<v Speaker 1>sometimes they get into the military and sometimes they get into the government</v>

1337
00:42:37.910 --> 00:42:39.800
<v Speaker 1>because they see that as the most efficient,</v>

1338
00:42:40.190 --> 00:42:43.250
<v Speaker 1>obvious way of helping the world and so yeah,</v>

1339
00:42:43.251 --> 00:42:45.080
<v Speaker 1>we can't do the whole black and white thing anymore,</v>

1340
00:42:45.081 --> 00:42:46.610
<v Speaker 1>but some of those people are not,</v>

1341
00:42:46.611 --> 00:42:46.941
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1342
00:42:46.941 --> 00:42:47.990
<v Speaker 1>let's have very high.</v>

1343
00:42:48.140 --> 00:42:49.640
<v Speaker 1>Some of those people are just like us.</v>

1344
00:42:49.641 --> 00:42:50.474
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

1345
00:42:50.630 --> 00:42:52.040
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit,</v>

1346
00:42:52.490 --> 00:42:53.690
<v Speaker 1>this is incredible.</v>

1347
00:42:53.930 --> 00:42:57.170
<v Speaker 1>Let's fund this and see where we can take it.</v>

1348
00:42:57.380 --> 00:42:58.820
<v Speaker 1>Let's see what we can do with it.</v>

1349
00:42:59.090 --> 00:42:59.970
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's like that.</v>

1350
00:43:00.060 --> 00:43:04.070
<v Speaker 1>That isn't my best case scenario is that our government actually becomes cool is</v>

1351
00:43:04.071 --> 00:43:07.130
<v Speaker 1>that the internet sort of forces only cool people in the office and our</v>

1352
00:43:07.131 --> 00:43:09.230
<v Speaker 1>government becomes something we can all tolerate.</v>

1353
00:43:09.260 --> 00:43:09.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1354
00:43:09.700 --> 00:43:10.431
<v Speaker 1>That's a dream.</v>

1355
00:43:10.431 --> 00:43:11.270
<v Speaker 1>The ultimate thing,</v>

1356
00:43:11.271 --> 00:43:11.720
<v Speaker 1>I mean this,</v>

1357
00:43:11.720 --> 00:43:16.040
<v Speaker 1>the structure itself is really only a problem when enough corruption exists to</v>

1358
00:43:16.220 --> 00:43:18.380
<v Speaker 1>capitalize on the holes in the system.</v>

1359
00:43:18.410 --> 00:43:18.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1360
00:43:18.770 --> 00:43:19.410
<v Speaker 1>like the,</v>

1361
00:43:19.410 --> 00:43:19.790
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1362
00:43:19.790 --> 00:43:24.790
<v Speaker 1>the being influenced by big money corporations twist policy to suit their needs.</v>

1363
00:43:27.051 --> 00:43:27.884
<v Speaker 1>They could profit.</v>

1364
00:43:28.010 --> 00:43:29.300
<v Speaker 1>All that stuff's a problem,</v>

1365
00:43:29.870 --> 00:43:32.600
<v Speaker 1>but the system itself is not the worst system in the world.</v>

1366
00:43:32.690 --> 00:43:32.991
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1367
00:43:32.991 --> 00:43:33.500
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>

1368
00:43:33.500 --> 00:43:34.221
<v Speaker 1>It's not awful.</v>

1369
00:43:34.221 --> 00:43:35.210
<v Speaker 1>If everybody was cool,</v>

1370
00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:35.721
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1371
00:43:35.721 --> 00:43:37.280
<v Speaker 1>if you had an entire system,</v>

1372
00:43:38.030 --> 00:43:38.361
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1373
00:43:38.361 --> 00:43:39.590
<v Speaker 1>have a think,</v>

<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1408
00:44:33.420 --> 00:44:38.300
<v Speaker 5>Big corporations are stuffing their wolf assholes picking up their wolf tail.</v>

<v Speaker 5>And it just packing money and their wolf assholes and sending them out there to</v>

1419
00:44:55.890 --> 00:45:00.000

<v Speaker 5>try to do our best,</v>

1434
00:45:20.850 --> 00:45:23.250
<v Speaker 5>like we all take turns running the government,</v>

1435
00:45:23.430 --> 00:45:24.750
<v Speaker 5>like everybody gets a week,</v>

1436
00:45:25.080 --> 00:45:25.441
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1437
00:45:25.441 --> 00:45:26.670
<v Speaker 5>and it's a fucking very,</v>

1438
00:45:26.700 --> 00:45:27.533
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1439
00:45:27.710 --> 00:45:27.960
<v Speaker 5>it's a,</v>

1440
00:45:27.960 --> 00:45:29.490
<v Speaker 5>it's a very prestigious job.</v>

1441
00:45:29.490 --> 00:45:32.490
<v Speaker 5>Everybody gets very excited about the possibility of representing our country</v>

1442
00:45:32.491 --> 00:45:33.170
<v Speaker 5>for a week.</v>

1443
00:45:33.170 --> 00:45:33.390
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1444
00:45:33.390 --> 00:45:37.440
<v Speaker 5>And you go there and you do your best to do the will of the people.</v>

1445
00:45:37.441 --> 00:45:39.030
<v Speaker 5>You make rational choices.</v>

1446
00:45:39.031 --> 00:45:42.000
<v Speaker 5>You all tried to talk it through and everybody knows it's very possible.</v>

1447
00:45:42.001 --> 00:45:43.140
<v Speaker 5>One day you're going to get called,</v>

1448
00:45:43.141 --> 00:45:43.710
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

1449
00:45:43.710 --> 00:45:44.543
<v Speaker 5>you're going to get a call.</v>

1450
00:45:44.690 --> 00:45:47.220
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to ask you to be the president for a week and you've got to step in</v>

1451
00:45:47.221 --> 00:45:49.260
<v Speaker 5>cause you're a fucking American and that's what we do.</v>

1452
00:45:49.310 --> 00:45:49.481
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1453
00:45:49.481 --> 00:45:49.801
<v Speaker 5>And I go,</v>

1454
00:45:49.801 --> 00:45:53.910
<v Speaker 5>Duncan Trussell you are a president for the week and you'll go on TV and you go,</v>

1455
00:45:53.911 --> 00:45:55.200
<v Speaker 5>I am so not prepared.</v>

1456
00:45:55.201 --> 00:45:55.680
<v Speaker 5>But I,</v>

1457
00:45:55.680 --> 00:45:59.430
<v Speaker 5>I promise as an American I am going to do my best to do what's right,</v>

1458
00:45:59.580 --> 00:46:04.420
<v Speaker 5>to do what's ethical and to do it benefits the greater humanity of the world.</v>

1459
00:46:05.100 --> 00:46:08.490
<v Speaker 5>Do it day after tomorrow because I procrastinate.</v>

1460
00:46:09.360 --> 00:46:10.830
<v Speaker 5>My trainer was coming over,</v>

1461
00:46:10.840 --> 00:46:11.940
<v Speaker 5>I have to beat off.</v>

1462
00:46:14.710 --> 00:46:16.590
<v Speaker 5>What if that was like what happened?</v>

1463
00:46:16.591 --> 00:46:18.300
<v Speaker 5>Like everybody got to be the president,</v>

1464
00:46:18.300 --> 00:46:18.340
<v Speaker 5>isn't it</v>

1465
00:46:18.340 --> 00:46:19.173
<v Speaker 4>for a week?</v>

1466
00:46:19.300 --> 00:46:19.960
<v Speaker 4>Everybody has.</v>

1467
00:46:19.960 --> 00:46:21.280
<v Speaker 4>It'd be amazing if you're a duty.</v>

1468
00:46:21.400 --> 00:46:21.850
<v Speaker 4>It's a,</v>

1469
00:46:21.850 --> 00:46:24.760
<v Speaker 4>it's what you're talking about is a beautiful idea and,</v>

1470
00:46:24.761 --> 00:46:26.410
<v Speaker 4>and I think that it's possible.</v>

1471
00:46:26.620 --> 00:46:30.670
<v Speaker 4>I think that's another crazy thing about this time around is it's possible when</v>

1472
00:46:30.671 --> 00:46:31.504
<v Speaker 4>people hear that,</v>

1473
00:46:31.870 --> 00:46:32.830
<v Speaker 4>you know and obviously you're,</v>

1474
00:46:32.831 --> 00:46:33.080
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

1475
00:46:33.080 --> 00:46:33.913
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

1476
00:46:34.630 --> 00:46:37.900
<v Speaker 4>we're not talking about that literally but with ideas like be when people hear</v>

1477
00:46:37.901 --> 00:46:38.351
<v Speaker 4>what you're saying.</v>

1478
00:46:38.351 --> 00:46:43.180
<v Speaker 4>Any kind of optimism right now in general in the world is met with a pretty</v>

1479
00:46:43.181 --> 00:46:44.380
<v Speaker 4>severe eye roll.</v>

1480
00:46:44.381 --> 00:46:45.670
<v Speaker 4>I come on day,</v>

1481
00:46:45.671 --> 00:46:49.660
<v Speaker 4>I really think you can clear out those walls tore talking about a fucking</v>

1482
00:46:49.661 --> 00:46:51.610
<v Speaker 4>government that is bought and sold.</v>

1483
00:46:51.790 --> 00:46:54.280
<v Speaker 4>It is controlled by the prison industrial complex.</v>

1484
00:46:54.281 --> 00:46:55.750
<v Speaker 4>It is controlled by big Pharma.</v>

1485
00:46:55.960 --> 00:46:58.360
<v Speaker 4>It is controlled by the military industrial complex.</v>

1486
00:46:58.570 --> 00:46:59.470
<v Speaker 4>These people,</v>

1487
00:46:59.650 --> 00:47:03.760
<v Speaker 4>their pockets are loaded with so much fucking doe and they have been so</v>

1488
00:47:03.761 --> 00:47:08.761
<v Speaker 4>conditioned by a game that dehumanizes people to the point where they no longer</v>

1489
00:47:10.151 --> 00:47:14.830
<v Speaker 4>see giant swaths of humans and other countries as people.</v>

1490
00:47:15.090 --> 00:47:18.130
<v Speaker 4>The it is important to realize that these wolves that you're talking about,</v>

1491
00:47:18.370 --> 00:47:20.470
<v Speaker 4>we're talking about a different species here,</v>

1492
00:47:20.471 --> 00:47:21.070
<v Speaker 4>friend.</v>

1493
00:47:21.070 --> 00:47:26.070
<v Speaker 4>If you look at like what's going on in the UK with these organized pedophile</v>

1494
00:47:26.081 --> 00:47:26.441
<v Speaker 4>rings,</v>

1495
00:47:26.441 --> 00:47:30.880
<v Speaker 4>it seems to consist of people and the level of government,</v>

1496
00:47:31.030 --> 00:47:32.380
<v Speaker 4>I can't remember who it was.</v>

1497
00:47:32.381 --> 00:47:33.790
<v Speaker 4>One of the investigators said,</v>

1498
00:47:33.791 --> 00:47:37.030
<v Speaker 4>it seems to be built into the system in some way.</v>

1499
00:47:37.870 --> 00:47:38.231
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1500
00:47:38.231 --> 00:47:38.950
<v Speaker 4>look it up.</v>

1501
00:47:38.950 --> 00:47:40.690
<v Speaker 4>It's scary fucking shit man.</v>

1502
00:47:40.810 --> 00:47:42.040
<v Speaker 4>That's insane.</v>

1503
00:47:42.070 --> 00:47:42.903
<v Speaker 4>So when you look ahead,</v>

1504
00:47:43.060 --> 00:47:46.570
<v Speaker 4>avoided that stuff cause it bumped me out when I saw those those stores with,</v>

1505
00:47:46.600 --> 00:47:47.470
<v Speaker 4>that's what they're saying.</v>

1506
00:47:47.530 --> 00:47:48.363
<v Speaker 4>That's what they're saying.</v>

1507
00:47:48.370 --> 00:47:49.450
<v Speaker 4>But here's the difference.</v>

1508
00:47:49.451 --> 00:47:49.991
<v Speaker 4>Here's the difference.</v>

1509
00:47:49.991 --> 00:47:52.090
<v Speaker 4>And that's horrifying to imagine cause you know this,</v>

1510
00:47:52.210 --> 00:47:52.720
<v Speaker 4>we hear it.</v>

1511
00:47:52.720 --> 00:47:55.960
<v Speaker 4>It's so funny to hear it with the UK government and people are like,</v>

1512
00:47:56.290 --> 00:47:57.070
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>

1513
00:47:57.070 --> 00:48:00.100
<v Speaker 4>But now you hear about a priest doing it and people are like,</v>

1514
00:48:00.101 --> 00:48:00.371
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1515
00:48:00.371 --> 00:48:01.360
<v Speaker 4>that just happens.</v>

1516
00:48:01.540 --> 00:48:02.830
<v Speaker 4>It's like you're looking at,</v>

1517
00:48:03.490 --> 00:48:03.851
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1518
00:48:03.851 --> 00:48:08.770
<v Speaker 4>an organized system that has as part of the destructive,</v>

1519
00:48:09.220 --> 00:48:12.160
<v Speaker 4>a result that it reaps on the planet.</v>

1520
00:48:12.190 --> 00:48:16.750
<v Speaker 4>Also psychically wounding children in the worst way possible.</v>

1521
00:48:16.900 --> 00:48:18.250
<v Speaker 4>So this is a,</v>

1522
00:48:18.530 --> 00:48:19.363
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1523
00:48:19.690 --> 00:48:20.523
<v Speaker 4>I think that,</v>

1524
00:48:20.830 --> 00:48:25.830
<v Speaker 4>that the reason that that isn't as grim and horrible as it sounds is because the</v>

1525
00:48:26.561 --> 00:48:29.620
<v Speaker 4>difference today as opposed to 30 years ago,</v>

1526
00:48:29.890 --> 00:48:34.840
<v Speaker 4>is that we get to say it in front of however many zillions of people listened to</v>

1527
00:48:34.841 --> 00:48:35.770
<v Speaker 4>your podcast.</v>

1528
00:48:36.010 --> 00:48:36.400
<v Speaker 4>And it,</v>

1529
00:48:36.400 --> 00:48:40.120
<v Speaker 4>that info instantly travels around the world 30 years ago.</v>

1530
00:48:40.240 --> 00:48:45.220
<v Speaker 4>If you think that if there truly is an organized group of pedophiles that have</v>

1531
00:48:45.221 --> 00:48:46.270
<v Speaker 4>as their membership,</v>

1532
00:48:46.570 --> 00:48:48.970
<v Speaker 4>high ranking government officials,</v>

1533
00:48:48.971 --> 00:48:50.470
<v Speaker 4>not just probably in the UK,</v>

1534
00:48:50.471 --> 00:48:52.000
<v Speaker 4>but in the United States too,</v>

1535
00:48:52.300 --> 00:48:54.790
<v Speaker 4>if that really does exist,</v>

1536
00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:59.170
<v Speaker 4>it didn't just start today or last week or two years ago.</v>

1537
00:48:59.320 --> 00:49:01.060
<v Speaker 4>That's been around for a long,</v>

1538
00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:02.680
<v Speaker 4>long time.</v>

1539
00:49:02.860 --> 00:49:07.860
<v Speaker 4>So the difference between back then and now is that shit is getting everywhere.</v>

1540
00:49:08.291 --> 00:49:11.890
<v Speaker 4>It's everyone on planet earth is aware of this investigation.</v>

1541
00:49:12.190 --> 00:49:14.200
<v Speaker 4>You can't get that genie back in the bottle.</v>

1542
00:49:14.201 --> 00:49:15.970
<v Speaker 4>Even though I think a lot of people are trying,</v>

1543
00:49:16.180 --> 00:49:19.150
<v Speaker 4>they're saying that the whistle blowers for this,</v>

1544
00:49:19.300 --> 00:49:19.760
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1545
00:49:19.760 --> 00:49:21.100
<v Speaker 4>are not going to have immunity.</v>

1546
00:49:21.400 --> 00:49:22.620
<v Speaker 4>That's one thing that the government,</v>

1547
00:49:22.621 --> 00:49:22.870
<v Speaker 4>instead,</v>

1548
00:49:22.870 --> 00:49:26.470
<v Speaker 4>if you're a whistle blower for this weird ring of pedophiles,</v>

1549
00:49:26.680 --> 00:49:27.670
<v Speaker 4>no immunity,</v>

1550
00:49:27.850 --> 00:49:29.110
<v Speaker 4>you're going to jail too.</v>

1551
00:49:29.320 --> 00:49:30.700
<v Speaker 4>So they're like squelching.</v>

1552
00:49:30.850 --> 00:49:33.970
<v Speaker 4>There seems to be an element that is trying to push this shit down,</v>

1553
00:49:33.971 --> 00:49:34.511
<v Speaker 4>of course,</v>

1554
00:49:34.511 --> 00:49:38.140
<v Speaker 4>because if it's true that there that some speculate that even members of the</v>

1555
00:49:38.141 --> 00:49:40.570
<v Speaker 4>royal family could be involved in this shit.</v>

1556
00:49:40.750 --> 00:49:42.130
<v Speaker 4>So yeah,</v>

1557
00:49:42.131 --> 00:49:42.580
<v Speaker 4>look it up.</v>

1558
00:49:42.580 --> 00:49:42.971
<v Speaker 4>I usually,</v>

1559
00:49:42.971 --> 00:49:47.560
<v Speaker 4>it's a deep dark David Lynch level twin peaks shit coaster,</v>

1560
00:49:47.740 --> 00:49:48.220
<v Speaker 4>but the,</v>

1561
00:49:48.220 --> 00:49:49.053
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1562
00:49:49.420 --> 00:49:50.253
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1563
00:49:56.560 --> 00:49:58.660
<v Speaker 4>that might be one of the best descriptions ever.</v>

1564
00:49:59.110 --> 00:49:59.943
<v Speaker 4>Say that again.</v>

1565
00:50:00.010 --> 00:50:03.070
<v Speaker 4>A deep dark David Lynch level shit coaster</v>

1566
00:50:06.310 --> 00:50:09.880
<v Speaker 4>twin peaks style worms deep in the ground.</v>

1567
00:50:10.090 --> 00:50:10.720
<v Speaker 4>This is,</v>

1568
00:50:10.720 --> 00:50:11.051
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

1569
00:50:11.051 --> 00:50:15.100
<v Speaker 4>but the positive thing is they're getting exposed in a way that they could never</v>

1570
00:50:15.101 --> 00:50:16.330
<v Speaker 4>been exposed before.</v>

1571
00:50:16.510 --> 00:50:17.560
<v Speaker 4>So yeah,</v>

1572
00:50:17.590 --> 00:50:18.351
<v Speaker 4>I think that the,</v>

1573
00:50:18.351 --> 00:50:21.520
<v Speaker 4>that any kind of darkness that is existing on the world,</v>

1574
00:50:21.521 --> 00:50:25.900
<v Speaker 4>it's very good to use the example of Wolf's being driven up a hill with torches.</v>

1575
00:50:26.080 --> 00:50:26.891
<v Speaker 4>It's just in this case,</v>

1576
00:50:26.891 --> 00:50:28.010
<v Speaker 4>the or Edwards,</v>

1577
00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:29.480
<v Speaker 1>the torch bearers,</v>

1578
00:50:29.630 --> 00:50:30.770
<v Speaker 1>or Edward Snowden,</v>

1579
00:50:30.920 --> 00:50:32.000
<v Speaker 1>Julian's massage,</v>

1580
00:50:32.120 --> 00:50:37.120
<v Speaker 1>all the whistle blowers who have the fucking guts to reveal and eliminate this</v>

1581
00:50:37.730 --> 00:50:38.563
<v Speaker 1>probably,</v>

1582
00:50:39.040 --> 00:50:39.873
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1583
00:50:40.490 --> 00:50:45.490
<v Speaker 1>pretty built in old system of humans that have victimized children,</v>

1584
00:50:48.141 --> 00:50:50.070
<v Speaker 1>victimized children and the world and the planet,</v>

1585
00:50:50.071 --> 00:50:53.780
<v Speaker 1>and it seemed to take a lot of pleasure from victimizing other human beings.</v>

1586
00:50:53.781 --> 00:50:54.231
<v Speaker 1>It's there.</v>

1587
00:50:54.231 --> 00:50:55.580
<v Speaker 1>It might be a secret religion.</v>

1588
00:50:55.581 --> 00:50:56.090
<v Speaker 1>Who knows?</v>

1589
00:50:56.090 --> 00:51:01.090
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that the reason why this stuff exists more in the older countries,</v>

1590
00:51:01.850 --> 00:51:03.170
<v Speaker 1>the reason why this,</v>

1591
00:51:03.171 --> 00:51:07.700
<v Speaker 1>this system might be in place in somewhere like the UK.</v>

1592
00:51:07.790 --> 00:51:08.000
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1593
00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:09.920
<v Speaker 1>this is horrible reality.</v>

1594
00:51:09.921 --> 00:51:11.390
<v Speaker 1>Like that Jimmy Seville guy,</v>

1595
00:51:11.391 --> 00:51:16.391
<v Speaker 1>that guy that was the presenter on television that it turned out was some crazy</v>

1596
00:51:16.641 --> 00:51:17.271
<v Speaker 1>pedophile.</v>

1597
00:51:17.271 --> 00:51:17.750
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1598
00:51:17.750 --> 00:51:19.880
<v Speaker 1>These guys that are in this country,</v>

1599
00:51:19.881 --> 00:51:20.090
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1600
00:51:20.090 --> 00:51:22.160
<v Speaker 1>England is an amazing country,</v>

1601
00:51:22.161 --> 00:51:22.490
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1602
00:51:22.490 --> 00:51:23.660
<v Speaker 1>London's fantastic.</v>

1603
00:51:23.661 --> 00:51:26.630
<v Speaker 1>One of the weirdest things about London when you're walking around as you see</v>

1604
00:51:26.631 --> 00:51:30.260
<v Speaker 1>the age of things and it makes you as an American feel like God might countries</v>

1605
00:51:30.261 --> 00:51:33.950
<v Speaker 1>a baby like this country has been around for a thousand fucking years,</v>

1606
00:51:33.951 --> 00:51:38.780
<v Speaker 1>but does it not have the echoes of those old people just like we talked about</v>

1607
00:51:38.781 --> 00:51:38.991
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>

1608
00:51:38.991 --> 00:51:40.070
<v Speaker 1>the echoes of savages?</v>

1609
00:51:40.220 --> 00:51:41.360
<v Speaker 1>Does it not have that?</v>

1610
00:51:41.390 --> 00:51:41.661
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

1611
00:51:41.661 --> 00:51:44.120
<v Speaker 1>And don't you think that the best case of escaping that,</v>

1612
00:51:44.121 --> 00:51:44.521
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like,</v>

1613
00:51:44.521 --> 00:51:48.080
<v Speaker 1>like literally escaping the physical space of that contract.</v>

1614
00:51:48.081 --> 00:51:51.290
<v Speaker 1>So getting it and the people that are trapped there and might take them longer</v>

1615
00:51:51.291 --> 00:51:53.200
<v Speaker 1>to shake that shit out yet.</v>

1616
00:51:53.201 --> 00:51:53.980
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1617
00:51:53.980 --> 00:51:57.470
<v Speaker 1>especially like if you look at the epigenetic research coming out,</v>

1618
00:51:57.471 --> 00:51:58.304
<v Speaker 1>the idea that,</v>

1619
00:51:58.610 --> 00:51:59.160
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1620
00:51:59.160 --> 00:52:03.350
<v Speaker 1>phobias get passed down genetically from one generation to the next,</v>

1621
00:52:03.351 --> 00:52:05.690
<v Speaker 1>then you're also kind of looking at,</v>

1622
00:52:05.930 --> 00:52:08.030
<v Speaker 1>it's a really curious thing and this is pure.</v>

1623
00:52:08.031 --> 00:52:09.190
<v Speaker 1>We will hit be ramble.</v>

1624
00:52:09.191 --> 00:52:10.280
<v Speaker 1>So I get it.</v>

1625
00:52:10.281 --> 00:52:12.390
<v Speaker 1>Everybody out there is going to tweet something.</v>

1626
00:52:12.440 --> 00:52:13.400
<v Speaker 1>How wrong this is.</v>

1627
00:52:13.401 --> 00:52:14.090
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

1628
00:52:14.090 --> 00:52:14.923
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1629
00:52:15.030 --> 00:52:18.620
<v Speaker 1>that if like I was thinking like these countries where a war's been going on</v>

1630
00:52:18.621 --> 00:52:19.454
<v Speaker 1>forever,</v>

1631
00:52:19.910 --> 00:52:20.960
<v Speaker 1>if epigenetics,</v>

1632
00:52:20.961 --> 00:52:24.500
<v Speaker 1>if what they're thinking about epigenetics is correct and that phobias get</v>

1633
00:52:24.501 --> 00:52:29.501
<v Speaker 1>passed down through somehow chromosomally then if there is a place where war has</v>

1634
00:52:30.771 --> 00:52:32.030
<v Speaker 1>been happening long enough,</v>

1635
00:52:32.240 --> 00:52:37.070
<v Speaker 1>then there is the potential that encoded genetically into the people who have</v>

1636
00:52:37.071 --> 00:52:42.071
<v Speaker 1>been living there is like all the phobias and fears and terror that comes from</v>

1637
00:52:42.501 --> 00:52:47.050
<v Speaker 1>living in a war zone for hundreds and hundreds of years that like it's the,</v>

1638
00:52:47.051 --> 00:52:50.960
<v Speaker 1>it's inside of them somehow it's like made its way inside of them.</v>

1639
00:52:51.200 --> 00:52:53.370
<v Speaker 1>It's a really scary thing to think it and,</v>

1640
00:52:53.400 --> 00:52:58.400
<v Speaker 1>and that the problem that we are experiencing is not just our own inner turmoil</v>

1641
00:52:59.841 --> 00:53:03.260
<v Speaker 1>that comes from all the laws and catastrophe that is inevitable and human life.</v>

1642
00:53:03.530 --> 00:53:06.620
<v Speaker 1>But there were also dealing with all the turmoil and catastrophe of our</v>

1643
00:53:06.621 --> 00:53:08.350
<v Speaker 1>ancestors and that,</v>

1644
00:53:08.600 --> 00:53:08.871
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1645
00:53:08.871 --> 00:53:09.740
<v Speaker 1>the United States,</v>

1646
00:53:09.920 --> 00:53:10.550
<v Speaker 1>it's been,</v>

1647
00:53:10.550 --> 00:53:11.001
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1648
00:53:11.001 --> 00:53:13.130
<v Speaker 1>our wars are happening elsewhere.</v>

1649
00:53:13.370 --> 00:53:18.370
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the spoiled Brat aspects of our warlike country is that we don't</v>

1650
00:53:19.070 --> 00:53:24.070
<v Speaker 1>experience what it's like to hear the hum of a drone and the suddenly the</v>

1651
00:53:25.231 --> 00:53:29.370
<v Speaker 1>incineration of a landmark that we have grown up around.</v>

1652
00:53:29.680 --> 00:53:30.990
<v Speaker 1>We haven't experienced that.</v>

1653
00:53:31.140 --> 00:53:33.630
<v Speaker 1>That's why the motto of the weather underground,</v>

1654
00:53:33.631 --> 00:53:36.970
<v Speaker 1>that terrorist organization that was trying to homeland terror organization that</v>

1655
00:53:36.971 --> 00:53:39.240
<v Speaker 1>was trying to protest Vietnam,</v>

1656
00:53:39.480 --> 00:53:41.760
<v Speaker 1>their motto was bringing the war back home.</v>

1657
00:53:41.970 --> 00:53:46.470
<v Speaker 1>They wanted to blow up buildings in the United States to demonstrate to people</v>

1658
00:53:46.620 --> 00:53:49.350
<v Speaker 1>this is what it looks like when bombs go off.</v>

1659
00:53:49.560 --> 00:53:51.270
<v Speaker 1>We're doing that there.</v>

1660
00:53:51.420 --> 00:53:53.640
<v Speaker 1>So if this epigenetic shit is correct,</v>

1661
00:53:53.940 --> 00:53:55.740
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people living in the United States,</v>

1662
00:53:55.950 --> 00:53:59.190
<v Speaker 1>they're not going to have the same kind of phobias,</v>

1663
00:53:59.500 --> 00:53:59.820
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1664
00:53:59.820 --> 00:54:03.000
<v Speaker 1>in their chromosomes that people living in countries that have been exposed to</v>

1665
00:54:03.001 --> 00:54:05.010
<v Speaker 1>war for hundreds of years would have.</v>

1666
00:54:05.760 --> 00:54:06.061
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1667
00:54:06.061 --> 00:54:07.200
<v Speaker 1>There's no getting around it,</v>

1668
00:54:07.201 --> 00:54:07.680
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1669
00:54:07.680 --> 00:54:09.960
<v Speaker 1>No getting you look at like bs,</v>

1670
00:54:10.020 --> 00:54:12.120
<v Speaker 1>like you look at a B that makes a beehive.</v>

1671
00:54:12.660 --> 00:54:13.150
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1672
00:54:13.150 --> 00:54:14.850
<v Speaker 1>we were talking about bees earlier today.</v>

1673
00:54:14.851 --> 00:54:16.680
<v Speaker 1>Like what would it be like to be a be right?</v>

1674
00:54:16.890 --> 00:54:18.190
<v Speaker 1>It might be some beautiful things.</v>

1675
00:54:18.210 --> 00:54:19.043
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1676
00:54:19.340 --> 00:54:22.140
<v Speaker 1>Where it was supposed to be getting the information to build that hive.</v>

1677
00:54:22.141 --> 00:54:23.690
<v Speaker 1>Why are they all doing the exact same thing?</v>

1678
00:54:23.710 --> 00:54:24.030
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1679
00:54:24.030 --> 00:54:27.480
<v Speaker 1>How do they figure out that they're supposed to go get the nectar and then</v>

1680
00:54:27.481 --> 00:54:30.310
<v Speaker 1>they're covered with Paula and then these fly over to the other flower.</v>

1681
00:54:30.570 --> 00:54:32.880
<v Speaker 1>Is that encoded in them somehow?</v>

1682
00:54:32.880 --> 00:54:34.560
<v Speaker 1>It must be if they can't communicate.</v>

1683
00:54:34.740 --> 00:54:35.910
<v Speaker 1>I think it's all doing it.</v>

1684
00:54:35.940 --> 00:54:36.571
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a,</v>

1685
00:54:36.571 --> 00:54:37.340
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

1686
00:54:37.340 --> 00:54:37.680
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

1687
00:54:37.680 --> 00:54:38.150
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

1688
00:54:38.150 --> 00:54:41.280
<v Speaker 1>it's a frequency that they're structured is tuning into.</v>

1689
00:54:41.281 --> 00:54:46.281
<v Speaker 1>Like if you saw a remote control car at tiny little remote control car zipping</v>

1690
00:54:46.681 --> 00:54:50.910
<v Speaker 1>around on the table and it was like avoiding obstacles and going to exactly</v>

1691
00:54:50.911 --> 00:54:52.590
<v Speaker 1>where it would go if you were like,</v>

1692
00:54:52.591 --> 00:54:56.490
<v Speaker 1>let me look inside the car to find the way that it's able to figure all this</v>

1693
00:54:56.491 --> 00:54:57.324
<v Speaker 1>shit out,</v>

1694
00:54:57.450 --> 00:54:59.760
<v Speaker 1>you would be missing what was really happening,</v>

1695
00:54:59.761 --> 00:55:03.990
<v Speaker 1>which is that the car is tuning in to a frequency that is,</v>

1696
00:55:04.420 --> 00:55:04.891
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1697
00:55:04.891 --> 00:55:07.170
<v Speaker 1>the directing it.</v>

1698
00:55:07.171 --> 00:55:08.640
<v Speaker 1>So you place it and I mean again,</v>

1699
00:55:08.930 --> 00:55:09.170
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1700
00:55:09.170 --> 00:55:12.660
<v Speaker 1>it's a totally fascinating concept and it might totally be right.</v>

1701
00:55:13.170 --> 00:55:13.381
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1702
00:55:13.381 --> 00:55:18.210
<v Speaker 1>think about how many different bugs exhibit the exact same behavior.</v>

1703
00:55:18.450 --> 00:55:20.490
<v Speaker 1>All of them all over the world.</v>

1704
00:55:20.490 --> 00:55:21.720
<v Speaker 1>They have their own little groups.</v>

1705
00:55:21.721 --> 00:55:22.840
<v Speaker 1>They exhibit the same behavior.</v>

1706
00:55:22.841 --> 00:55:23.730
<v Speaker 1>They know how to build these,</v>

1707
00:55:23.760 --> 00:55:24.780
<v Speaker 1>these leaf cutter ants.</v>

1708
00:55:24.781 --> 00:55:27.630
<v Speaker 1>They build these gigantic compounds,</v>

1709
00:55:27.900 --> 00:55:28.670
<v Speaker 1>dig holes.</v>

1710
00:55:28.670 --> 00:55:32.180
<v Speaker 1>They create little areas were like leaves for meant,</v>

1711
00:55:32.340 --> 00:55:32.731
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1712
00:55:32.731 --> 00:55:33.171
<v Speaker 1>like it's,</v>

1713
00:55:33.171 --> 00:55:37.590
<v Speaker 1>it's a bizarre complicated thing they figured out how to all do,</v>

1714
00:55:38.090 --> 00:55:41.940
<v Speaker 1>like it's not so out of the question and think that they're getting that from</v>

1715
00:55:41.941 --> 00:55:44.610
<v Speaker 1>the sky or they're getting that from some,</v>

1716
00:55:44.940 --> 00:55:45.760
<v Speaker 1>some frequency.</v>

1717
00:55:45.760 --> 00:55:48.510
<v Speaker 1>They have a channel they can tune it in and we can't.</v>

1718
00:55:48.780 --> 00:55:49.021
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1719
00:55:49.021 --> 00:55:49.141
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1720
00:55:49.141 --> 00:55:50.070
<v Speaker 1>and you get into like,</v>

1721
00:55:50.100 --> 00:55:50.461
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1722
00:55:50.461 --> 00:55:52.560
<v Speaker 1>two dimensional stuff where it's like,</v>

1723
00:55:52.561 --> 00:55:53.394
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1724
00:55:53.490 --> 00:55:58.490
<v Speaker 1>if it's epigenetics and if information is being trance for not just in writing,</v>

1725
00:56:00.860 --> 00:56:01.140
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1726
00:56:01.140 --> 00:56:03.690
<v Speaker 1>and not just in the teachings of the parents to the kids,</v>

1727
00:56:03.691 --> 00:56:08.691
<v Speaker 1>but chromosomally then that means that every living entity is the very tip of a</v>

1728
00:56:10.081 --> 00:56:15.081
<v Speaker 1>temporal appendage that stretches all the way back to the big bag.</v>

1729
00:56:15.450 --> 00:56:17.370
<v Speaker 1>So it's not just an ant,</v>

1730
00:56:17.371 --> 00:56:22.371
<v Speaker 1>it's the end of the genetic line of that particular aunt family tree that goes</v>

1731
00:56:22.651 --> 00:56:24.250
<v Speaker 1>all the way back through time</v>

1732
00:56:24.460 --> 00:56:28.070
<v Speaker 4>and it's transferring information via a chromosome.</v>

1733
00:56:28.071 --> 00:56:31.570
<v Speaker 4>So this is a creature you're looking at the very tip of it.</v>

1734
00:56:31.840 --> 00:56:36.550
<v Speaker 4>It's like what I'm Douglas Adams said about mice and hitchhiker's guide to the</v>

1735
00:56:36.551 --> 00:56:37.384
<v Speaker 4>galaxy.</v>

1736
00:56:37.600 --> 00:56:42.100
<v Speaker 4>That mice were actually the very tip of the appendages of a super intelligent</v>

1737
00:56:42.101 --> 00:56:44.200
<v Speaker 4>creature that likes to study scientists.</v>

1738
00:56:48.520 --> 00:56:49.560
<v Speaker 7>Ah,</v>

1739
00:56:51.090 --> 00:56:52.230
<v Speaker 4>that's beautiful.</v>

1740
00:56:52.530 --> 00:56:53.161
<v Speaker 4>It's so cool,</v>

1741
00:56:53.161 --> 00:56:53.670
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1742
00:56:53.670 --> 00:56:53.851
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1743
00:56:53.851 --> 00:56:54.121
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

1744
00:56:54.121 --> 00:56:54.960
<v Speaker 4>but in the same way,</v>

1745
00:56:54.961 --> 00:56:56.830
<v Speaker 4>it's like every single one of us is just,</v>

1746
00:56:56.831 --> 00:57:01.770
<v Speaker 4>there's the tip of this temporal appendage or opting into this fucking dimension</v>

1747
00:57:01.771 --> 00:57:02.300
<v Speaker 4>in that,</v>

1748
00:57:02.300 --> 00:57:02.730
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1749
00:57:02.730 --> 00:57:04.740
<v Speaker 4>connected to us theoretically,</v>

1750
00:57:04.741 --> 00:57:05.574
<v Speaker 4>by the way,</v>

1751
00:57:05.700 --> 00:57:07.290
<v Speaker 4>don't ever fucking show of,</v>

1752
00:57:07.320 --> 00:57:08.040
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1753
00:57:08.040 --> 00:57:12.750
<v Speaker 4>some of my stone or one internet article on epigenetics or you won't suddenly</v>

1754
00:57:12.751 --> 00:57:16.020
<v Speaker 4>become a doctor of epigenetics and won't shut up about it.</v>

1755
00:57:16.380 --> 00:57:17.250
<v Speaker 4>So I'm sorry.</v>

1756
00:57:17.460 --> 00:57:18.780
<v Speaker 4>But if that stuff is true,</v>

1757
00:57:18.781 --> 00:57:23.781
<v Speaker 4>man and memories are being transferred chromosomally then that means that we are</v>

1758
00:57:24.181 --> 00:57:24.981
<v Speaker 4>the very end of it.</v>

1759
00:57:24.981 --> 00:57:28.950
<v Speaker 4>Telephone wire that goes back through all our ancestors all the way down to</v>

1760
00:57:29.340 --> 00:57:33.720
<v Speaker 4>proto hominids and before that to whatever fucking shit we were in the</v>

1761
00:57:33.721 --> 00:57:34.171
<v Speaker 4>beginning.</v>

1762
00:57:34.171 --> 00:57:37.170
<v Speaker 4>And that information is like zinging up through,</v>

1763
00:57:37.200 --> 00:57:42.090
<v Speaker 4>through time and is a determining possibly determining what we like and what we</v>

1764
00:57:42.091 --> 00:57:42.750
<v Speaker 4>don't like.</v>

1765
00:57:42.750 --> 00:57:43.800
<v Speaker 5>It totally makes sense.</v>

1766
00:57:43.890 --> 00:57:46.890
<v Speaker 5>I mean this is the most recent civilization in modern,</v>

1767
00:57:46.950 --> 00:57:47.280
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1768
00:57:47.280 --> 00:57:49.200
<v Speaker 5>modern world is America.</v>

1769
00:57:49.530 --> 00:57:51.270
<v Speaker 5>And this is the most recent version of it.</v>

1770
00:57:51.330 --> 00:57:52.163
<v Speaker 5>California.</v>

1771
00:57:52.380 --> 00:57:54.330
<v Speaker 5>This is like everybody got,</v>

1772
00:57:54.420 --> 00:57:56.490
<v Speaker 5>they land on the east coast and they went fuck this.</v>

1773
00:57:56.491 --> 00:57:57.580
<v Speaker 5>And they kept going right?</v>

1774
00:57:57.600 --> 00:58:00.120
<v Speaker 5>And the really crazy fuckers made it all the way over to here.</v>

1775
00:58:00.210 --> 00:58:01.710
<v Speaker 5>This is like the latest version.</v>

1776
00:58:01.740 --> 00:58:03.210
<v Speaker 5>If you go back the furthest,</v>

1777
00:58:03.470 --> 00:58:04.500
<v Speaker 5>go back the furthest,</v>

1778
00:58:04.830 --> 00:58:05.760
<v Speaker 5>you're an Africa,</v>

1779
00:58:05.790 --> 00:58:06.370
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1780
00:58:06.370 --> 00:58:07.290
<v Speaker 5>You're in Iraq,</v>

1781
00:58:07.370 --> 00:58:07.770
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1782
00:58:07.770 --> 00:58:08.011
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>

1783
00:58:08.011 --> 00:58:08.910
<v Speaker 5>that's the beat that,</v>

1784
00:58:08.911 --> 00:58:11.110
<v Speaker 5>so my assertion was always at that,</v>

1785
00:58:11.250 --> 00:58:12.630
<v Speaker 5>those are the townies of the world,</v>

1786
00:58:12.660 --> 00:58:12.901
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1787
00:58:12.901 --> 00:58:13.501
<v Speaker 5>That's what that is.</v>

1788
00:58:13.501 --> 00:58:13.621
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

1789
00:58:13.621 --> 00:58:14.370
<v Speaker 5>this is where the,</v>

1790
00:58:14.370 --> 00:58:15.480
<v Speaker 5>this is where the people started.</v>

1791
00:58:16.020 --> 00:58:16.920
<v Speaker 5>Everybody was left.</v>

1792
00:58:17.130 --> 00:58:20.190
<v Speaker 5>It's still believing shit that was written down on tablets because they never</v>

1793
00:58:20.191 --> 00:58:22.020
<v Speaker 5>got a fresh influx of DNA.</v>

1794
00:58:22.130 --> 00:58:22.440
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1795
00:58:22.440 --> 00:58:24.540
<v Speaker 5>There's still dealing with the old operating system.</v>

1796
00:58:24.540 --> 00:58:26.580
<v Speaker 5>They have windows 95 and the machines right.</v>

1797
00:58:26.760 --> 00:58:27.940
<v Speaker 5>And they never got out right.</v>

1798
00:58:27.960 --> 00:58:28.591
<v Speaker 5>They never got out.</v>

1799
00:58:28.591 --> 00:58:29.424
<v Speaker 5>They're still there.</v>

1800
00:58:29.570 --> 00:58:30.220
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

1801
00:58:30.220 --> 00:58:31.110
<v Speaker 5>and not only that,</v>

1802
00:58:31.111 --> 00:58:32.220
<v Speaker 5>they're dealing with loss.</v>

1803
00:58:32.280 --> 00:58:34.580
<v Speaker 5>They're dealing with massive loss left and right.</v>

1804
00:58:34.640 --> 00:58:36.780
<v Speaker 5>A mass more than a million people dead over there.</v>

1805
00:58:37.050 --> 00:58:37.721
<v Speaker 5>So the,</v>

1806
00:58:37.721 --> 00:58:38.321
<v Speaker 5>the there,</v>

1807
00:58:38.321 --> 00:58:38.730
<v Speaker 5>there,</v>

1808
00:58:38.730 --> 00:58:41.460
<v Speaker 5>the need for revenge is through the roof.</v>

1809
00:58:41.520 --> 00:58:42.780
<v Speaker 5>The madness is through the roof.</v>

1810
00:58:42.781 --> 00:58:46.170
<v Speaker 5>The loss of loved ones is all the chaos that comes along with that,</v>

1811
00:58:46.171 --> 00:58:46.830
<v Speaker 5>through the roof,</v>

1812
00:58:46.830 --> 00:58:49.620
<v Speaker 5>which almost reinforces the old ways of thinking.</v>

1813
00:58:49.950 --> 00:58:50.431
<v Speaker 5>That's it,</v>

1814
00:58:50.431 --> 00:58:50.760
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

1815
00:58:50.760 --> 00:58:51.240
<v Speaker 5>Less,</v>

1816
00:58:51.240 --> 00:58:53.040
<v Speaker 5>it's less than new DNA.</v>

1817
00:58:53.041 --> 00:58:56.070
<v Speaker 5>It's rekindling the most primal of DMA,</v>

1818
00:58:56.071 --> 00:58:58.950
<v Speaker 5>the animal that wants to kill the other attacking animal.</v>

1819
00:58:59.090 --> 00:58:59.451
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1820
00:58:59.451 --> 00:58:59.680
<v Speaker 4>That,</v>

1821
00:58:59.680 --> 00:58:59.931
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1822
00:58:59.931 --> 00:59:01.210
<v Speaker 4>you got to let me listen menu.</v>

1823
00:59:01.290 --> 00:59:04.130
<v Speaker 4>If you live in a country where wars happening all the time,</v>

1824
00:59:04.370 --> 00:59:05.720
<v Speaker 4>you got a lot to work with,</v>

1825
00:59:05.721 --> 00:59:05.931
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1826
00:59:05.931 --> 00:59:10.460
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of shit that you've seen in a lot of fear that you've seen,</v>

1827
00:59:10.461 --> 00:59:11.211
<v Speaker 4>that you've witnessed in.</v>

1828
00:59:11.211 --> 00:59:14.660
<v Speaker 4>And this is like this interview I did with Doblin was really cool.</v>

1829
00:59:14.661 --> 00:59:17.690
<v Speaker 4>He's talking about one of the folks that,</v>

1830
00:59:17.691 --> 00:59:18.524
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1831
00:59:18.650 --> 00:59:20.210
<v Speaker 4>helps out at maps is a,</v>

1832
00:59:20.211 --> 00:59:20.651
<v Speaker 4>is like a,</v>

1833
00:59:20.651 --> 00:59:22.820
<v Speaker 4>one of the descendants who,</v>

1834
00:59:22.821 --> 00:59:24.200
<v Speaker 4>and I can't remember his name now,</v>

1835
00:59:24.500 --> 00:59:25.161
<v Speaker 4>but who,</v>

1836
00:59:25.161 --> 00:59:25.994
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1837
00:59:26.660 --> 00:59:30.440
<v Speaker 4>who is recognized that in these war torn parts of the world,</v>

1838
00:59:31.190 --> 00:59:32.023
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1839
00:59:32.060 --> 00:59:34.420
<v Speaker 4>if you really want to heal the,</v>

1840
00:59:34.540 --> 00:59:37.280
<v Speaker 4>the psychic damage has been done to these people.</v>

1841
00:59:37.281 --> 00:59:41.540
<v Speaker 4>It's going to require Mtma assisted psychotherapy or some kind of psychotropic</v>

1842
00:59:41.541 --> 00:59:43.670
<v Speaker 4>substance where you could get in there.</v>

1843
00:59:43.671 --> 00:59:45.590
<v Speaker 4>And I help deal with these,</v>

1844
00:59:45.650 --> 00:59:48.290
<v Speaker 4>these traumatic memories that people have over there.</v>

1845
00:59:48.300 --> 00:59:51.770
<v Speaker 4>That has to be a part of reconstruction,</v>

1846
00:59:52.030 --> 00:59:52.370
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1847
00:59:52.370 --> 00:59:53.840
<v Speaker 4>is not just going and build,</v>

1848
00:59:54.050 --> 00:59:57.050
<v Speaker 4>not just blowing a place up and then flying in and being like,</v>

1849
00:59:57.051 --> 00:59:57.381
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>

1850
00:59:57.381 --> 00:59:58.670
<v Speaker 4>we'll help you build it back up guys,</v>

1851
00:59:58.671 --> 00:59:58.940
<v Speaker 4>aren't we?</v>

1852
00:59:58.940 --> 00:59:59.721
<v Speaker 4>We're fine now.</v>

1853
00:59:59.721 --> 01:00:00.051
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1854
01:00:00.051 --> 01:00:00.890
<v Speaker 4>Everybody's cool.</v>

1855
01:00:01.150 --> 01:00:01.983
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

1856
01:00:02.840 --> 01:00:03.051
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

1857
01:00:03.051 --> 01:00:04.520
<v Speaker 4>we made you a water treatment plant.</v>

1858
01:00:05.300 --> 01:00:06.680
<v Speaker 4>We did is we did.</v>

1859
01:00:06.830 --> 01:00:07.101
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1860
01:00:07.101 --> 01:00:08.690
<v Speaker 4>it's like you gotta get in there and like,</v>

1861
01:00:08.780 --> 01:00:10.460
<v Speaker 4>and not just there everywhere.</v>

1862
01:00:10.670 --> 01:00:10.851
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

1863
01:00:10.851 --> 01:00:12.470
<v Speaker 4>we gotta get in there and we have to start,</v>

1864
01:00:12.790 --> 01:00:13.101
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1865
01:00:13.101 --> 01:00:17.180
<v Speaker 4>doing a lot of inner work with ourselves so that we can,</v>

1866
01:00:17.630 --> 01:00:18.463
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1867
01:00:18.830 --> 01:00:20.780
<v Speaker 4>so that we're not going to fuck up once this,</v>

1868
01:00:20.960 --> 01:00:25.250
<v Speaker 4>once we hit a certain mph when it comes to technological acceleration,</v>

1869
01:00:25.580 --> 01:00:25.821
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1870
01:00:25.821 --> 01:00:26.121
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

1871
01:00:26.121 --> 01:00:27.290
<v Speaker 4>that's the thing.</v>

1872
01:00:27.291 --> 01:00:28.400
<v Speaker 4>There's two jobs,</v>

1873
01:00:28.430 --> 01:00:30.440
<v Speaker 4>work on the south and then,</v>

1874
01:00:30.441 --> 01:00:30.920
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1875
01:00:30.920 --> 01:00:32.960
<v Speaker 4>do as much as you can to help in the world.</v>

1876
01:00:32.990 --> 01:00:35.210
<v Speaker 4>Do you want to be the force of kindness?</v>

1877
01:00:35.390 --> 01:00:39.170
<v Speaker 4>You want to be that wave of positivity that you're talking about?</v>

1878
01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:42.200
<v Speaker 4>Because the hope is that the more that there there is,</v>

1879
01:00:42.201 --> 01:00:45.640
<v Speaker 4>the more it'll trickle trickle a end to end to that.</v>

1880
01:00:46.280 --> 01:00:47.061
<v Speaker 4>As I'm saying this,</v>

1881
01:00:47.061 --> 01:00:47.400
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

1882
01:00:47.400 --> 01:00:48.020
<v Speaker 4>oh no,</v>

1883
01:00:48.020 --> 01:00:48.281
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1884
01:00:48.281 --> 01:00:48.471
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

1885
01:00:48.471 --> 01:00:49.410
<v Speaker 4>Allowing people up,</v>

1886
01:00:49.411 --> 01:00:49.701
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

1887
01:00:49.701 --> 01:00:50.330
<v Speaker 4>they're there.</v>

1888
01:00:50.330 --> 01:00:51.440
<v Speaker 4>How do you fix that?</v>

1889
01:00:51.441 --> 01:00:51.681
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1890
01:00:51.681 --> 01:00:53.600
<v Speaker 4>I just write what's the solution?</v>

1891
01:00:53.780 --> 01:00:55.070
<v Speaker 4>There's one part of me that's like,</v>

1892
01:00:55.280 --> 01:00:59.780
<v Speaker 4>I know that if I know that the combination of these technologies along with a</v>

1893
01:01:00.110 --> 01:01:04.370
<v Speaker 4>shift towards the positive or the concerted effort by a certain number of people</v>

1894
01:01:04.371 --> 01:01:09.170
<v Speaker 4>to turn their attention to the potentiality of our species can create an</v>

1895
01:01:09.171 --> 01:01:10.640
<v Speaker 4>incredible change in the planet.</v>

1896
01:01:10.910 --> 01:01:14.390
<v Speaker 4>And then there's another part of me that's like no friend,</v>

1897
01:01:14.420 --> 01:01:16.850
<v Speaker 4>no nuclear proliferation,</v>

1898
01:01:17.090 --> 01:01:18.560
<v Speaker 4>biological weapons.</v>

1899
01:01:18.910 --> 01:01:19.550
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1900
01:01:19.550 --> 01:01:21.230
<v Speaker 4>there's no fucking way to like,</v>

1901
01:01:23.030 --> 01:01:24.140
<v Speaker 4>there's no way to uh,</v>

1902
01:01:24.230 --> 01:01:25.063
<v Speaker 4>to stop it.</v>

1903
01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:26.033
<v Speaker 5>Is that true though?</v>

1904
01:01:26.430 --> 01:01:28.500
<v Speaker 5>Because if we look at life right now,</v>

1905
01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:29.970
<v Speaker 5>no nuclear war,</v>

1906
01:01:30.270 --> 01:01:31.410
<v Speaker 5>no biological war,</v>

1907
01:01:31.800 --> 01:01:32.551
<v Speaker 5>why would we seem to,</v>

1908
01:01:32.551 --> 01:01:35.640
<v Speaker 5>that's inevitable if we're smart enough to avoid that right now with all the</v>

1909
01:01:35.641 --> 01:01:40.641
<v Speaker 5>conflicts over mineral rights and oil in the fucking ad Arctic region and the</v>

1910
01:01:41.190 --> 01:01:45.240
<v Speaker 5>Soviet Union's plant and flags and new spots near Greenland or wherever the fuck</v>

1911
01:01:45.241 --> 01:01:46.230
<v Speaker 5>they are yet,</v>

1912
01:01:46.290 --> 01:01:47.520
<v Speaker 5>we're just talking about blowing each other up.</v>

1913
01:01:47.850 --> 01:01:48.031
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

1914
01:01:48.031 --> 01:01:49.110
<v Speaker 5>why do we have to think that Dutch?</v>

1915
01:01:49.120 --> 01:01:51.870
<v Speaker 5>It's inevitable if we're all on the same trend.</v>

1916
01:01:52.290 --> 01:01:57.290
<v Speaker 5>If human beings are not tolerating this shit like overall that we did before,</v>

1917
01:01:57.631 --> 01:01:59.880
<v Speaker 5>people were more aware of like what we're talking about before.</v>

1918
01:01:59.900 --> 01:02:00.061
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1919
01:02:00.061 --> 01:02:02.940
<v Speaker 5>That's one of the reason why it's so horrific when you see acts of violence</v>

1920
01:02:02.941 --> 01:02:03.540
<v Speaker 5>today.</v>

1921
01:02:03.540 --> 01:02:05.580
<v Speaker 5>When you see someone blowing up a mosque today,</v>

1922
01:02:05.581 --> 01:02:08.160
<v Speaker 5>when you see someone gunning down people at a synagogue,</v>

1923
01:02:08.161 --> 01:02:10.710
<v Speaker 5>any crazy religious motivated things,</v>

1924
01:02:10.860 --> 01:02:13.830
<v Speaker 5>especially in us and people that you don't even know whether they were the wrong</v>

1925
01:02:13.831 --> 01:02:14.241
<v Speaker 5>religion,</v>

1926
01:02:14.241 --> 01:02:15.020
<v Speaker 5>so he gunned him down.</v>

1927
01:02:15.020 --> 01:02:15.200
<v Speaker 5>Alex,</v>

1928
01:02:15.200 --> 01:02:17.610
<v Speaker 5>it's the worst representation of the human mindset,</v>

1929
01:02:17.640 --> 01:02:17.821
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1930
01:02:17.821 --> 01:02:18.654
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

1931
01:02:18.770 --> 01:02:23.770
<v Speaker 5>When when you're seeing that and you're seeing the potential,</v>

1932
01:02:24.630 --> 01:02:26.520
<v Speaker 5>you're seeing this potential for oneness,</v>

1933
01:02:26.521 --> 01:02:28.230
<v Speaker 5>almost like a DMT trip.</v>

1934
01:02:28.620 --> 01:02:30.480
<v Speaker 5>You're almost seeing like a living,</v>

1935
01:02:30.481 --> 01:02:32.340
<v Speaker 5>breathing DM t trip,</v>

1936
01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:32.690
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1937
01:02:32.690 --> 01:02:35.550
<v Speaker 5>That is a rounded is gut ease,</v>

1938
01:02:35.880 --> 01:02:36.990
<v Speaker 5>organic,</v>

1939
01:02:37.020 --> 01:02:41.910
<v Speaker 5>frustrated souls trapped in terrible scenarios,</v>

1940
01:02:41.911 --> 01:02:42.070
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1941
01:02:42.070 --> 01:02:43.800
<v Speaker 5>Without any of it being there,</v>

1942
01:02:43.801 --> 01:02:46.230
<v Speaker 5>doing born in the Congo,</v>

1943
01:02:46.231 --> 01:02:48.990
<v Speaker 5>born in Iraq during the war,</v>

1944
01:02:49.320 --> 01:02:50.870
<v Speaker 5>born in Afghanistan,</v>

1945
01:02:50.900 --> 01:02:51.450
<v Speaker 5>all,</v>

1946
01:02:51.450 --> 01:02:52.440
<v Speaker 5>all the above,</v>

1947
01:02:52.590 --> 01:02:54.540
<v Speaker 5>born in Vietnam during the Vietnam War.</v>

1948
01:02:54.541 --> 01:02:58.740
<v Speaker 5>All this stuff is going on at the same time and all this chaos and fucking</v>

1949
01:02:59.040 --> 01:02:59.910
<v Speaker 5>outdated,</v>

1950
01:02:59.911 --> 01:03:04.650
<v Speaker 5>crazy monkey having a murder rampage take Bonnie Shit.</v>

1951
01:03:04.820 --> 01:03:05.071
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1952
01:03:05.071 --> 01:03:06.690
<v Speaker 5>And all that's going on right.</v>

1953
01:03:06.691 --> 01:03:08.890
<v Speaker 5>When the electronic DMT trip is happening.</v>

1954
01:03:08.910 --> 01:03:09.540
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

1955
01:03:09.540 --> 01:03:12.360
<v Speaker 5>All together at once and threaten each other.</v>

1956
01:03:12.361 --> 01:03:12.901
<v Speaker 5>So in,</v>

1957
01:03:12.901 --> 01:03:13.260
<v Speaker 5>in,</v>

1958
01:03:13.260 --> 01:03:14.130
<v Speaker 5>in certain ways.</v>

1959
01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:14.641
<v Speaker 5>That's right.</v>

1960
01:03:14.641 --> 01:03:15.230
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1961
01:03:15.230 --> 01:03:16.063
<v Speaker 5>awesome.</v>

1962
01:03:16.270 --> 01:03:16.541
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1963
01:03:16.541 --> 01:03:17.530
<v Speaker 4>Well that's what it seems like,</v>

1964
01:03:17.531 --> 01:03:17.741
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1965
01:03:17.741 --> 01:03:18.190
<v Speaker 4>And then you,</v>

1966
01:03:18.190 --> 01:03:18.580
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1967
01:03:18.580 --> 01:03:21.310
<v Speaker 4>you get into some really tricky terrain here because,</v>

1968
01:03:22.630 --> 01:03:22.920
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1969
01:03:22.920 --> 01:03:23.150
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

1970
01:03:23.150 --> 01:03:23.983
<v Speaker 4>you gotta like,</v>

1971
01:03:25.010 --> 01:03:25.590
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1972
01:03:25.590 --> 01:03:27.310
<v Speaker 4>isn't this race and organism?</v>

1973
01:03:27.580 --> 01:03:27.731
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1974
01:03:27.731 --> 01:03:28.031
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1975
01:03:28.031 --> 01:03:28.391
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>

1976
01:03:28.391 --> 01:03:28.931
<v Speaker 4>I think it is.</v>

1977
01:03:28.931 --> 01:03:30.580
<v Speaker 4>I think we're looking at a super organism.</v>

1978
01:03:30.581 --> 01:03:31.480
<v Speaker 4>All of humanity.</v>

1979
01:03:31.530 --> 01:03:31.780
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1980
01:03:31.780 --> 01:03:34.180
<v Speaker 4>Super Organism has some form of schizophrenia,</v>

1981
01:03:34.360 --> 01:03:35.320
<v Speaker 4>super organism.</v>

1982
01:03:35.321 --> 01:03:40.321
<v Speaker 4>It's like a tree and every single branch of the tree is a human being in that</v>

1983
01:03:40.840 --> 01:03:41.351
<v Speaker 4>tree.</v>

1984
01:03:41.351 --> 01:03:43.120
<v Speaker 4>The is all the,</v>

1985
01:03:43.121 --> 01:03:44.830
<v Speaker 4>some of the branches are fighting with each other.</v>

1986
01:03:45.100 --> 01:03:47.390
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't know what the tree yet and it's,</v>

1987
01:03:47.500 --> 01:03:51.010
<v Speaker 4>or another way to put it might be the tree is fighting over what kind of fruit</v>

1988
01:03:51.011 --> 01:03:51.770
<v Speaker 4>to bear.</v>

1989
01:03:51.770 --> 01:03:52.581
<v Speaker 4>And the tree is fine.</v>

1990
01:03:52.581 --> 01:03:57.581
<v Speaker 4>Like part of the tree wants to bear a super like radical Islamic fruit.</v>

1991
01:04:03.070 --> 01:04:03.731
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

1992
01:04:03.731 --> 01:04:04.750
<v Speaker 4>It wants there to be,</v>

1993
01:04:04.751 --> 01:04:06.580
<v Speaker 4>you want people to get up early in the morning,</v>

1994
01:04:06.810 --> 01:04:07.380
<v Speaker 4>pray,</v>

1995
01:04:07.380 --> 01:04:11.470
<v Speaker 4>pray once a women to wear is and it wants there to be that.</v>

1996
01:04:11.470 --> 01:04:14.050
<v Speaker 4>Now that's an extreme version and I don't know how,</v>

1997
01:04:14.470 --> 01:04:16.990
<v Speaker 4>how enormous that population is.</v>

1998
01:04:17.260 --> 01:04:17.820
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1999
01:04:17.820 --> 01:04:18.371
<v Speaker 4>I actually,</v>

2000
01:04:18.371 --> 01:04:18.970
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2001
01:04:18.970 --> 01:04:19.511
<v Speaker 4>when I did,</v>

2002
01:04:19.511 --> 01:04:20.100
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2003
01:04:20.100 --> 01:04:20.770
<v Speaker 4>a lot,</v>

2004
01:04:20.770 --> 01:04:22.970
<v Speaker 4>one of my live podcast man where I answered there,</v>

2005
01:04:22.971 --> 01:04:25.240
<v Speaker 4>there's a Muslim in the audience in this guy was like,</v>

2006
01:04:25.241 --> 01:04:26.074
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2007
01:04:26.110 --> 01:04:29.620
<v Speaker 4>and I had him come on stage and talk about isis and he's like,</v>

2008
01:04:29.621 --> 01:04:30.340
<v Speaker 4>we fucking hate,</v>

2009
01:04:30.340 --> 01:04:31.270
<v Speaker 4>we hate them.</v>

2010
01:04:31.570 --> 01:04:33.070
<v Speaker 4>Like that's not what it is at all.</v>

2011
01:04:33.071 --> 01:04:34.900
<v Speaker 4>That's just the most extreme,</v>

2012
01:04:35.110 --> 01:04:37.000
<v Speaker 4>ridiculous version of it.</v>

2013
01:04:37.270 --> 01:04:38.103
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2014
01:04:38.200 --> 01:04:39.580
<v Speaker 4>and he was as sweet as could be,</v>

2015
01:04:39.581 --> 01:04:39.851
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

2016
01:04:39.851 --> 01:04:44.851
<v Speaker 4>This guy was like the opposite of any thing that you would consider to be even</v>

2017
01:04:45.221 --> 01:04:48.190
<v Speaker 4>mildly fucked up or dangerous.</v>

2018
01:04:48.340 --> 01:04:51.310
<v Speaker 4>He like saying this like beautiful prayer.</v>

2019
01:04:51.311 --> 01:04:55.070
<v Speaker 4>It didn't feel like he was secretly anything at all.</v>

2020
01:04:55.071 --> 01:04:56.080
<v Speaker 4>It was a beautiful thing,</v>

2021
01:04:56.081 --> 01:04:56.291
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

2022
01:04:56.291 --> 01:04:57.124
<v Speaker 4>It was really cool.</v>

2023
01:04:57.160 --> 01:04:57.700
<v Speaker 4>Of course.</v>

2024
01:04:57.700 --> 01:04:58.690
<v Speaker 4>So of course,</v>

2025
01:04:58.750 --> 01:04:59.583
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

2026
01:05:00.460 --> 01:05:01.091
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

2027
01:05:01.091 --> 01:05:02.350
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of people who say,</v>

2028
01:05:02.470 --> 01:05:02.720
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2029
01:05:02.720 --> 01:05:02.891
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2030
01:05:02.891 --> 01:05:02.991
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2031
01:05:02.991 --> 01:05:03.130
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2032
01:05:03.130 --> 01:05:03.730
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

2033
01:05:03.730 --> 01:05:05.320
<v Speaker 4>The whole fucking thing's fucked.</v>

2034
01:05:05.530 --> 01:05:07.870
<v Speaker 4>That if we're really gonna like make this a better planet,</v>

2035
01:05:08.260 --> 01:05:10.450
<v Speaker 4>then more and more and more and more and more,</v>

2036
01:05:10.800 --> 01:05:13.510
<v Speaker 4>you have to abandon these antiquated symbol structures.</v>

2037
01:05:13.720 --> 01:05:18.720
<v Speaker 4>We have to turn our eyes away from our addiction to the past and like focus on</v>

2038
01:05:20.621 --> 01:05:20.980
<v Speaker 4>the now.</v>

2039
01:05:20.980 --> 01:05:21.701
<v Speaker 4>I don't agree with that.</v>

2040
01:05:21.701 --> 01:05:24.160
<v Speaker 4>I think there's a lot of beauty to be harvested and all that stuff,</v>

2041
01:05:24.161 --> 01:05:25.720
<v Speaker 4>but still man,</v>

2042
01:05:25.721 --> 01:05:30.721
<v Speaker 4>it's like it's a complicated problem because what do we do when three d printers</v>

2043
01:05:33.310 --> 01:05:35.650
<v Speaker 4>meet DNA?</v>

2044
01:05:35.710 --> 01:05:39.160
<v Speaker 4>What do we do when you can three d print and Ebola virus?</v>

2045
01:05:39.161 --> 01:05:40.540
<v Speaker 4>What do you do when you can,</v>

2046
01:05:40.690 --> 01:05:43.690
<v Speaker 4>when that technology is accessible to anyone who wants it?</v>

2047
01:05:44.030 --> 01:05:46.000
<v Speaker 4>Because that's a problem is that we're,</v>

2048
01:05:46.001 --> 01:05:50.320
<v Speaker 4>everybody's going to have this level of power and you really do just need two</v>

2049
01:05:50.321 --> 01:05:51.040
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

2050
01:05:51.040 --> 01:05:52.960
<v Speaker 4>You want to like fuck up guns.</v>

2051
01:05:53.030 --> 01:05:54.760
<v Speaker 4>You want to fuck up guns for everybody.</v>

2052
01:05:54.761 --> 01:05:55.594
<v Speaker 4>What do you do?</v>

2053
01:05:55.960 --> 01:05:56.591
<v Speaker 4>You start shooting.</v>

2054
01:05:56.591 --> 01:05:58.330
<v Speaker 4>People start shooting people.</v>

2055
01:05:58.420 --> 01:06:01.210
<v Speaker 4>You want to fuck up and inevitably what happens?</v>

2056
01:06:01.240 --> 01:06:01.870
<v Speaker 4>What happens?</v>

2057
01:06:01.870 --> 01:06:02.703
<v Speaker 4>Someone will do it.</v>

2058
01:06:02.860 --> 01:06:03.130
<v Speaker 4>If you,</v>

2059
01:06:03.130 --> 01:06:03.881
<v Speaker 4>there's guns,</v>

2060
01:06:03.881 --> 01:06:08.470
<v Speaker 4>inevitably some fucking asshole who is either going to hallucinate a bird</v>

2061
01:06:08.471 --> 01:06:11.110
<v Speaker 4>talking to him or just have a fucking,</v>

2062
01:06:11.330 --> 01:06:12.050
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2063
01:06:12.050 --> 01:06:16.990
<v Speaker 4>a chip on his shoulder about his boss is going to go into a fucking place and</v>

2064
01:06:16.991 --> 01:06:18.130
<v Speaker 4>shoot up a bunch of people.</v>

2065
01:06:18.370 --> 01:06:19.780
<v Speaker 4>And that ruins it for all of us.</v>

2066
01:06:19.930 --> 01:06:21.670
<v Speaker 4>Now if you own a gun,</v>

2067
01:06:21.790 --> 01:06:24.700
<v Speaker 4>some people will think you're a fucking asshole for no reason.</v>

2068
01:06:24.910 --> 01:06:28.240
<v Speaker 4>Just cause they don't understand that it's fun to blow up things at a firing</v>

2069
01:06:28.241 --> 01:06:29.074
<v Speaker 4>range.</v>

2070
01:06:30.340 --> 01:06:31.173
<v Speaker 4>It's just fun.</v>

2071
01:06:31.540 --> 01:06:32.180
<v Speaker 4>Nothing,</v>

2072
01:06:32.180 --> 01:06:32.861
<v Speaker 4>nothing else.</v>

2073
01:06:32.861 --> 01:06:37.750
<v Speaker 4>I just like watching skeet explode from time to time I have theirs.</v>

2074
01:06:37.780 --> 01:06:38.261
<v Speaker 4>That's it.</v>

2075
01:06:38.261 --> 01:06:40.870
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't indicate some darkness in my heart.</v>

2076
01:06:41.020 --> 01:06:42.220
<v Speaker 4>It's fun to be outside.</v>

2077
01:06:42.340 --> 01:06:43.750
<v Speaker 4>It's fun to watch shit blow up.</v>

2078
01:06:43.930 --> 01:06:45.430
<v Speaker 4>It's fun to hear big booms.</v>

2079
01:06:45.490 --> 01:06:46.210
<v Speaker 4>It's fun.</v>

2080
01:06:46.210 --> 01:06:47.020
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

2081
01:06:47.020 --> 01:06:47.590
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2082
01:06:47.590 --> 01:06:48.423
<v Speaker 4>anyway,</v>

2083
01:06:48.430 --> 01:06:49.420
<v Speaker 4>that's beside the point.</v>

2084
01:06:49.421 --> 01:06:49.751
<v Speaker 4>The point is,</v>

2085
01:06:49.751 --> 01:06:50.560
<v Speaker 4>that's a gun,</v>

2086
01:06:50.560 --> 01:06:51.393
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2087
01:06:51.400 --> 01:06:52.930
<v Speaker 4>The fucking guns that are coming,</v>

2088
01:06:52.931 --> 01:06:53.764
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

2089
01:06:54.010 --> 01:06:55.720
<v Speaker 4>this shit that's coming down the pipes,</v>

2090
01:06:56.170 --> 01:06:59.230
<v Speaker 4>the fact that you're going to be able to have some wet works bio lab and your</v>

2091
01:06:59.231 --> 01:07:02.050
<v Speaker 4>basement and harvest some kind of weird shit.</v>

2092
01:07:02.500 --> 01:07:02.800
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2093
01:07:02.800 --> 01:07:03.011
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2094
01:07:03.011 --> 01:07:03.430
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2095
01:07:03.430 --> 01:07:07.030
<v Speaker 4>the weaponry that's going to be accessible to people in the future is going to</v>

2096
01:07:07.031 --> 01:07:09.310
<v Speaker 4>be way more powerful than what we have now.</v>

2097
01:07:09.520 --> 01:07:11.050
<v Speaker 4>And that's the scary part.</v>

2098
01:07:11.051 --> 01:07:15.910
<v Speaker 4>Don't you think that's kind of built into the system that in order for us to</v>

2099
01:07:15.911 --> 01:07:18.700
<v Speaker 4>progress to this next level,</v>

2100
01:07:18.970 --> 01:07:23.140
<v Speaker 4>the only thing that's holding us back is that there's going to be a certain</v>

2101
01:07:23.141 --> 01:07:24.580
<v Speaker 4>amount of people that are left behind.</v>

2102
01:07:25.060 --> 01:07:30.060
<v Speaker 4>So the idea is the system is almost ensuring by providing almost everyone with</v>

2103
01:07:31.601 --> 01:07:34.150
<v Speaker 4>the same technological capabilities to destroy the world,</v>

2104
01:07:34.630 --> 01:07:36.610
<v Speaker 4>that we all have to get it together.</v>

2105
01:07:36.610 --> 01:07:40.870
<v Speaker 4>Like you have to force people to take care of all the fucked up spots.</v>

2106
01:07:41.220 --> 01:07:41.681
<v Speaker 4>Literally.</v>

2107
01:07:41.681 --> 01:07:46.560
<v Speaker 4>We have to literally embrace the idea of us as a super organism and they any</v>

2108
01:07:46.600 --> 01:07:47.770
<v Speaker 4>spot we see that sick,</v>

2109
01:07:47.800 --> 01:07:49.720
<v Speaker 4>we have to heal it immediately.</v>

2110
01:07:49.840 --> 01:07:51.880
<v Speaker 4>We can't look at some cancerous thing and go,</v>

2111
01:07:52.260 --> 01:07:54.150
<v Speaker 4>I'm not even gonna get that checked out.</v>

2112
01:07:54.160 --> 01:07:55.060
<v Speaker 4>What's cancerous?</v>

2113
01:07:55.390 --> 01:07:59.350
<v Speaker 4>The worst aspects of skid row skid rows,</v>

2114
01:07:59.351 --> 01:08:01.090
<v Speaker 4>cancerous skid row is a,</v>

2115
01:08:01.120 --> 01:08:03.070
<v Speaker 4>if you haven't been and you go to la,</v>

2116
01:08:03.430 --> 01:08:06.070
<v Speaker 4>really should go through downtown and see skid row.</v>

2117
01:08:06.071 --> 01:08:07.000
<v Speaker 4>Cause it's shocking.</v>

2118
01:08:07.001 --> 01:08:07.250
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

2119
01:08:07.250 --> 01:08:07.621
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

2120
01:08:07.621 --> 01:08:08.350
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

2121
01:08:08.350 --> 01:08:13.350
<v Speaker 4>it's one of the most densely packed representations of people with mental health</v>

2122
01:08:15.380 --> 01:08:15.801
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>

2123
01:08:15.801 --> 01:08:16.634
<v Speaker 4>despondent,</v>

2124
01:08:16.640 --> 01:08:17.451
<v Speaker 5>drug addicts,</v>

2125
01:08:17.451 --> 01:08:20.870
<v Speaker 5>all these all jammed into this area and they're all living out of boxes.</v>

2126
01:08:21.140 --> 01:08:21.890
<v Speaker 5>And it's like,</v>

2127
01:08:21.890 --> 01:08:23.390
<v Speaker 5>it's one of those things where you just go,</v>

2128
01:08:23.391 --> 01:08:23.631
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

2129
01:08:23.631 --> 01:08:25.100
<v Speaker 5>what is anyone going to do?</v>

2130
01:08:25.101 --> 01:08:25.520
<v Speaker 5>Anything?</v>

2131
01:08:25.520 --> 01:08:26.540
<v Speaker 5>Like what are they going to do is just come up.</v>

2132
01:08:26.550 --> 01:08:26.840
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2133
01:08:26.840 --> 01:08:28.730
<v Speaker 5>Put up places to feed them.</v>

2134
01:08:29.180 --> 01:08:29.481
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2135
01:08:29.481 --> 01:08:30.860

01:09:10.820 --> 01:09:15.470
<v Speaker 5>How about there's three times as many people and one third as much room as</v>

2176
01:09:15.471 --> 01:09:15.980
<v Speaker 5>America.</v>

2177
01:09:15.980 --> 01:09:16.640
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

2178
01:09:16.640 --> 01:09:17.870
<v Speaker 5>And they're going to keep going to,</v>

2179
01:09:17.871 --> 01:09:18.111
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

2180
01:09:18.111 --> 01:09:19.670
<v Speaker 5>They're going to keep your having sex with people.</v>

2181
01:09:19.840 --> 01:09:20.171
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2182
01:09:20.171 --> 01:09:20.331
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

2183
01:09:20.331 --> 01:09:20.481
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

2184
01:09:20.481 --> 01:09:20.730
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

2185
01:09:20.730 --> 01:09:20.940
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

2186
01:09:20.940 --> 01:09:21.450
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>

2187
01:09:21.450 --> 01:09:21.671
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

2188
01:09:21.671 --> 01:09:23.200
<v Speaker 4>So that's a problem,</v>

2189
01:09:23.201 --> 01:09:23.591
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

2190
01:09:23.591 --> 01:09:24.071
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy.</v>

2191
01:09:24.071 --> 01:09:24.311
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

2192
01:09:24.311 --> 01:09:25.071
<v Speaker 4>but in see the,</v>

2193
01:09:25.071 --> 01:09:26.890
<v Speaker 4>but that's where you get in a real interesting terrain,</v>

2194
01:09:26.891 --> 01:09:28.750
<v Speaker 4>which is that okay,</v>

2195
01:09:28.751 --> 01:09:30.340
<v Speaker 4>because the thing that you're talking about,</v>

2196
01:09:30.700 --> 01:09:34.270
<v Speaker 4>I'm pretty sure it's going in and cleaning up the cancer.</v>

2197
01:09:34.300 --> 01:09:35.860
<v Speaker 4>It's almost totally socialism.</v>

2198
01:09:36.040 --> 01:09:41.040
<v Speaker 4>It might make Alex Jones butthole suck so far inside of him that it would cause</v>

2199
01:09:41.831 --> 01:09:44.760
<v Speaker 4>the singularity gyros and he would,</v>

2200
01:09:44.770 --> 01:09:45.560
<v Speaker 4>he would be very upset.</v>

2201
01:09:45.560 --> 01:09:46.780
<v Speaker 4>Clean up that cancer.</v>

2202
01:09:46.781 --> 01:09:47.591
<v Speaker 4>What are you going to do?</v>

2203
01:09:47.591 --> 01:09:48.730
<v Speaker 4>Put Them in camps?</v>

2204
01:09:48.850 --> 01:09:50.080
<v Speaker 4>What are you going to me to amps.</v>

2205
01:09:50.170 --> 01:09:50.440
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2206
01:09:50.440 --> 01:09:53.170
<v Speaker 4>You're going to put them in Phoenix cause it is that that</v>

2207
01:09:53.170 --> 01:09:53.871
<v Speaker 5>though it's the,</v>

2208
01:09:53.871 --> 01:09:54.790
<v Speaker 5>it's kind of the opposite.</v>

2209
01:09:54.791 --> 01:09:56.830
<v Speaker 5>It's kind of figure out some way to give them,</v>

2210
01:09:57.310 --> 01:09:57.760
<v Speaker 5>Huh?</v>

2211
01:09:57.760 --> 01:10:00.280
<v Speaker 5>Will mean we will look at it like if you look at skid row,</v>

2212
01:10:00.281 --> 01:10:01.400
<v Speaker 5>how much money would it cost?</v>

2213
01:10:01.401 --> 01:10:02.080
<v Speaker 5>X Cleanup,</v>

2214
01:10:02.080 --> 01:10:02.741
<v Speaker 5>skid row,</v>

2215
01:10:02.741 --> 01:10:06.040
<v Speaker 5>how much money would it cost to almost a sign.</v>

2216
01:10:06.130 --> 01:10:11.130
<v Speaker 5>Like a swat team of specialists that can like re introduced homeless people back</v>

2217
01:10:13.901 --> 01:10:16.390
<v Speaker 5>into society and the in a comfortable way and get them jobs,</v>

2218
01:10:16.391 --> 01:10:18.720
<v Speaker 5>train them and like have money but to,</v>

2219
01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:19.500

2220
01:10:19.500 --> 01:10:19.720
<v Speaker 5>Sorry.</v>

2221
01:10:19.720 --> 01:10:21.280
<v Speaker 5>How much money would that cost?</v>

2222
01:10:21.281 --> 01:10:24.220
<v Speaker 5>Would there be even what the Iraq war costs and a day,</v>

2223
01:10:24.250 --> 01:10:24.670
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2224
01:10:24.670 --> 01:10:25.870
<v Speaker 5>I mean you could fax true.</v>

2225
01:10:25.900 --> 01:10:29.860
<v Speaker 5>You could fix jai hidden spots on earth with,</v>

2226
01:10:29.950 --> 01:10:31.180
<v Speaker 5>with money and everybody's like,</v>

2227
01:10:31.210 --> 01:10:31.481
<v Speaker 5>ah,</v>

2228
01:10:31.481 --> 01:10:33.220
<v Speaker 5>you can't just throw money at the problem.</v>

2229
01:10:33.221 --> 01:10:37.870
<v Speaker 5>It's our tax dollars as I'm talking about the exact same tax dollars.</v>

2230
01:10:37.950 --> 01:10:38.850
<v Speaker 5>Redistribute it.</v>

2231
01:10:38.860 --> 01:10:39.640
<v Speaker 5>That's cool.</v>

2232
01:10:39.640 --> 01:10:40.091
<v Speaker 5>If you,</v>

2233
01:10:40.091 --> 01:10:42.760
<v Speaker 5>if you really don't like the government taking your tax dollars,</v>

2234
01:10:42.761 --> 01:10:44.110
<v Speaker 5>I completely understand.</v>

2235
01:10:44.230 --> 01:10:45.400
<v Speaker 5>I completely understand.</v>

2236
01:10:45.460 --> 01:10:46.810
<v Speaker 5>But guess what?</v>

2237
01:10:47.020 --> 01:10:49.480
<v Speaker 5>You don't have any choice now as to what they do with it.</v>

2238
01:10:49.570 --> 01:10:49.751
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

2239
01:10:49.751 --> 01:10:53.860
<v Speaker 5>Wouldn't you be happy if they took the same amount of money and they just put</v>

2240
01:10:53.890 --> 01:10:55.540
<v Speaker 5>more of it towards that?</v>

2241
01:10:55.840 --> 01:10:59.880
<v Speaker 5>More of it towards fixing up all these fucked up neighborhoods where everybody's</v>

2242
01:10:59.890 --> 01:11:01.720
<v Speaker 5>born and to severe poverty.</v>

2243
01:11:01.750 --> 01:11:02.350
<v Speaker 5>That's cool.</v>

2244
01:11:02.350 --> 01:11:03.610
<v Speaker 5>That's a fucking cancer spot.</v>

2245
01:11:03.611 --> 01:11:06.310
<v Speaker 5>And that you could call me socialists cause I kind of am with that,</v>

2246
01:11:06.360 --> 01:11:07.181
<v Speaker 5>with that kind of stuff.</v>

2247
01:11:07.181 --> 01:11:08.014
<v Speaker 5>I kind of am.</v>

2248
01:11:08.050 --> 01:11:10.990
<v Speaker 5>I am with people that are trapped in bad circumstances.</v>

2249
01:11:11.110 --> 01:11:12.310
<v Speaker 5>I am with babies,</v>

2250
01:11:12.460 --> 01:11:14.100
<v Speaker 5>I am with that grow up</v>

2251
01:11:14.100 --> 01:11:15.030
<v Speaker 1>in horrible environments.</v>

2252
01:11:15.031 --> 01:11:16.170
<v Speaker 1>I'm totally socialist.</v>

2253
01:11:16.230 --> 01:11:16.471
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2254
01:11:16.471 --> 01:11:19.170
<v Speaker 1>I don't think those kids should have to pull themselves up by their bootstraps.</v>

2255
01:11:19.320 --> 01:11:23.160
<v Speaker 1>And I think there should be a way that we prevent these people that live in the</v>

2256
01:11:23.161 --> 01:11:26.000
<v Speaker 1>worst spots in the world from,</v>

2257
01:11:26.360 --> 01:11:30.900
<v Speaker 1>from continuing with that horrible like state of living,</v>

2258
01:11:31.110 --> 01:11:34.130
<v Speaker 1>that horrible quality of life where you're,</v>

2259
01:11:34.131 --> 01:11:35.310
<v Speaker 1>you're getting sick all the time.</v>

2260
01:11:35.311 --> 01:11:36.450
<v Speaker 1>Like Justin Wren,</v>

2261
01:11:36.480 --> 01:11:38.190
<v Speaker 1>who's a friend of mine from the UFC,</v>

2262
01:11:38.191 --> 01:11:40.890
<v Speaker 1>he used to fight in the UFC and now he's been working with the Congos and the</v>

2263
01:11:40.891 --> 01:11:41.724
<v Speaker 1>pygmies.</v>

2264
01:11:42.270 --> 01:11:46.350
<v Speaker 1>And these pygmies in the Congo is like the sweetest people and he helps them.</v>

2265
01:11:46.351 --> 01:11:47.310
<v Speaker 1>He gets a medication.</v>

2266
01:11:47.520 --> 01:11:49.290
<v Speaker 1>We helped fund wells there.</v>

2267
01:11:49.950 --> 01:11:50.191
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2268
01:11:50.191 --> 01:11:50.471
<v Speaker 1>And we,</v>

2269
01:11:50.471 --> 01:11:50.780
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

2270
01:11:50.780 --> 01:11:54.660
<v Speaker 1>we get people that donate money on bitcoin and I matched the money and then we</v>

2271
01:11:54.661 --> 01:11:55.740
<v Speaker 1>bought wells.</v>

2272
01:11:56.090 --> 01:11:56.761
<v Speaker 1>It's dude,</v>

2273
01:11:56.761 --> 01:11:57.300

01:11:57.300 --> 01:11:58.320
<v Speaker 1>this guy's the coolest.</v>

2275
01:11:58.321 --> 01:11:58.760
<v Speaker 1>But these,</v>

2276
01:11:58.760 --> 01:11:59.030
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2277
01:11:59.030 --> 01:12:01.770
<v Speaker 1>these people didn't ask to be born there man.</v>

2278
01:12:01.860 --> 01:12:04.410
<v Speaker 1>And they have these bulging stomachs because these little kids have all these</v>

2279
01:12:04.411 --> 01:12:07.010
<v Speaker 1>parasites inside of them and they have bad water.</v>

2280
01:12:07.040 --> 01:12:08.820
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the reasons why so many of them gets sick.</v>

2281
01:12:09.500 --> 01:12:10.950
<v Speaker 1>Is this case going over there man?</v>

2282
01:12:11.130 --> 01:12:14.490
<v Speaker 1>And this guy is helping these people in a very tangible,</v>

2283
01:12:14.610 --> 01:12:15.690
<v Speaker 1>very real sense.</v>

2284
01:12:15.720 --> 01:12:17.180
<v Speaker 1>He's right there in that.</v>

2285
01:12:17.760 --> 01:12:18.571
<v Speaker 1>And when,</v>

2286
01:12:18.571 --> 01:12:19.080
<v Speaker 1>when you,</v>

2287
01:12:19.080 --> 01:12:21.270
<v Speaker 1>when you see that someone out there is like that,</v>

2288
01:12:21.590 --> 01:12:23.970
<v Speaker 1>it's like it gives everybody a like a little more hope.</v>

2289
01:12:23.990 --> 01:12:24.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2290
01:12:24.080 --> 01:12:25.530
<v Speaker 1>That's what we have to do this,</v>

2291
01:12:25.531 --> 01:12:28.740
<v Speaker 1>what we have to do is make sure that all those spots where there's people,</v>

2292
01:12:28.890 --> 01:12:29.970
<v Speaker 1>all the spots for these people,</v>

2293
01:12:30.190 --> 01:12:31.050
<v Speaker 1>they get brought up,</v>

2294
01:12:31.290 --> 01:12:32.880
<v Speaker 1>took a normal way of living,</v>

2295
01:12:33.300 --> 01:12:38.160
<v Speaker 1>like a normal way of living Madison Education Shan food.</v>

2296
01:12:38.220 --> 01:12:39.120
<v Speaker 1>We can do that,</v>

2297
01:12:39.660 --> 01:12:44.660
<v Speaker 1>we can do that and all we have to do is just put different people in charge of</v>

2298
01:12:45.181 --> 01:12:46.420
<v Speaker 1>getting all the money right,</v>

2299
01:12:46.440 --> 01:12:49.470
<v Speaker 1>but just prop the other people pro instead of war profiting.</v>

2300
01:12:49.680 --> 01:12:52.740
<v Speaker 1>You just have like hope profiting.</v>

2301
01:12:52.830 --> 01:12:53.663
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2302
01:12:54.360 --> 01:12:59.310
<v Speaker 1>All these different organizations that people are like drawn to and they want</v>

2303
01:12:59.311 --> 01:13:01.560
<v Speaker 1>like a guy like Justin wren drawn to,</v>

2304
01:13:01.650 --> 01:13:02.590
<v Speaker 1>he has to go over there.</v>

2305
01:13:02.910 --> 01:13:04.590
<v Speaker 1>He spent six months over there,</v>

2306
01:13:04.710 --> 01:13:05.700
<v Speaker 1>he gets malaria,</v>

2307
01:13:05.701 --> 01:13:06.930
<v Speaker 1>he got fucking malaria.</v>

2308
01:13:06.990 --> 01:13:07.950
<v Speaker 1>Fuck yeah.</v>

2309
01:13:07.951 --> 01:13:10.950
<v Speaker 1>Fuck these people are out there,</v>

2310
01:13:10.951 --> 01:13:11.610
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2311
01:13:11.610 --> 01:13:12.420
<v Speaker 1>They're out there.</v>

2312
01:13:12.420 --> 01:13:14.130
<v Speaker 1>And then the idea is like instead of does,</v>

2313
01:13:14.160 --> 01:13:16.890
<v Speaker 1>instead of like recognizing those people are out there,</v>

2314
01:13:17.010 --> 01:13:20.040
<v Speaker 1>recognize that they're out there and then become one of them.</v>

2315
01:13:20.280 --> 01:13:21.510
<v Speaker 1>That's the next step.</v>

2316
01:13:21.540 --> 01:13:22.470
<v Speaker 1>But come one,</v>

2317
01:13:22.620 --> 01:13:24.110
<v Speaker 1>you know it's like this Guy Cornfield,</v>

2318
01:13:24.150 --> 01:13:25.200
<v Speaker 1>a Jack Kornfield.</v>

2319
01:13:25.201 --> 01:13:26.940
<v Speaker 1>This Buddhist teacher tells me about Buddhism.</v>

2320
01:13:27.120 --> 01:13:27.780
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>

2321
01:13:27.780 --> 01:13:29.730
<v Speaker 1>we don't want you to be a Buddhist.</v>

2322
01:13:29.940 --> 01:13:31.500
<v Speaker 1>We want you to be the Buddha.</v>

2323
01:13:31.740 --> 01:13:32.850
<v Speaker 1>Don't be a fucking,</v>

2324
01:13:32.851 --> 01:13:33.421
<v Speaker 1>don't you?</v>

2325
01:13:33.421 --> 01:13:35.730
<v Speaker 1>You want to become that you and anyone can.</v>

2326
01:13:35.731 --> 01:13:36.481
<v Speaker 1>That's the other thing,</v>

2327
01:13:36.481 --> 01:13:36.691
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2328
01:13:36.691 --> 01:13:41.691
<v Speaker 1>You can instantaneously right now by calling the number on your screen.</v>

2329
01:13:43.230 --> 01:13:45.270
<v Speaker 1>You can instantaneously right now,</v>

2330
01:13:45.300 --> 01:13:47.550
<v Speaker 1>no doubt about it within the next hour,</v>

2331
01:13:47.551 --> 01:13:49.800
<v Speaker 1>regardless of your economic situation,</v>

2332
01:13:50.160 --> 01:13:54.840
<v Speaker 1>give some percentage of what you have in a way that's probably barely going to</v>

2333
01:13:54.841 --> 01:13:59.700
<v Speaker 1>affect your life to some cause that in mass would create what you're talking</v>

2334
01:13:59.701 --> 01:14:00.180
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

2335
01:14:00.180 --> 01:14:01.230
<v Speaker 1>The healing beam,</v>

2336
01:14:01.380 --> 01:14:02.460
<v Speaker 1>the transformation,</v>

2337
01:14:02.461 --> 01:14:03.294
<v Speaker 1>this shift,</v>

2338
01:14:03.330 --> 01:14:04.650
<v Speaker 1>it could easily be dealt with.</v>

2339
01:14:04.651 --> 01:14:06.270
<v Speaker 1>You could do it right this second.</v>

2340
01:14:06.540 --> 01:14:09.300
<v Speaker 1>It's could and it could also be done with taxes.</v>

2341
01:14:09.930 --> 01:14:10.500
<v Speaker 1>It could be,</v>

2342
01:14:10.500 --> 01:14:12.040
<v Speaker 1>it can be needs to be both.</v>

2343
01:14:12.070 --> 01:14:13.300
<v Speaker 1>It's not just taxes.</v>

2344
01:14:13.301 --> 01:14:15.100
<v Speaker 1>Cause again that goes back to the government,</v>

2345
01:14:15.101 --> 01:14:15.611
<v Speaker 1>the government,</v>

2346
01:14:15.611 --> 01:14:16.031
<v Speaker 1>government,</v>

2347
01:14:16.031 --> 01:14:16.421
<v Speaker 1>government,</v>

2348
01:14:16.421 --> 01:14:16.751
<v Speaker 1>government,</v>

2349
01:14:16.751 --> 01:14:17.584
<v Speaker 1>government,</v>

2350
01:14:17.590 --> 01:14:19.870
<v Speaker 1>the government at least we could look at the books,</v>

2351
01:14:20.110 --> 01:14:23.620
<v Speaker 1>private citizens to start open up companies and go over there and do charity</v>

2352
01:14:23.621 --> 01:14:23.831
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>

2353
01:14:23.831 --> 01:14:25.930
<v Speaker 1>And we ended up pocketing a lot of the money.</v>

2354
01:14:26.290 --> 01:14:28.420
<v Speaker 1>Like it's still hits us back at the core level.</v>

2355
01:14:28.421 --> 01:14:33.400
<v Speaker 1>We got to figure out a way to eliminate greed and figure out a way to elevate</v>

2356
01:14:33.401 --> 01:14:36.250
<v Speaker 1>people up to like a normal health status.</v>

2357
01:14:36.280 --> 01:14:36.730
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

2358
01:14:36.730 --> 01:14:38.020
<v Speaker 1>Like modern living.</v>

2359
01:14:38.200 --> 01:14:38.651
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

2360
01:14:38.651 --> 01:14:39.490
<v Speaker 1>If they want to,</v>

2361
01:14:39.700 --> 01:14:40.570
<v Speaker 1>but what if they don't want to,</v>

2362
01:14:40.571 --> 01:14:41.290
<v Speaker 1>if they don't want,</v>

2363
01:14:41.290 --> 01:14:43.540
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's a lot of people that live in the jungle of Brazil.</v>

2364
01:14:43.541 --> 01:14:44.081
<v Speaker 1>They probably was like,</v>

2365
01:14:44.081 --> 01:14:44.701
<v Speaker 1>fuck this man,</v>

2366
01:14:44.701 --> 01:14:45.534
<v Speaker 1>I like it right here.</v>

2367
01:14:45.550 --> 01:14:50.260
<v Speaker 1>Or like the guy I pass next to the seven 11 yesterday I saw shoot up with black</v>

2368
01:14:50.261 --> 01:14:51.094
<v Speaker 1>tar heroin.</v>

2369
01:14:51.520 --> 01:14:51.851
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

2370
01:14:51.851 --> 01:14:52.690
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that,</v>

2371
01:14:52.720 --> 01:14:53.260
<v Speaker 1>if like,</v>

2372
01:14:53.260 --> 01:14:54.670
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's getting to like,</v>

2373
01:14:54.890 --> 01:14:59.890
<v Speaker 1>I can't imagine what conversation and like some nice air condition dome I could</v>

2374
01:15:00.731 --> 01:15:02.080
<v Speaker 1>have with that guy that,</v>

2375
01:15:02.100 --> 01:15:02.561
<v Speaker 1>but you know what,</v>

2376
01:15:02.561 --> 01:15:03.221
<v Speaker 1>that's not fair.</v>

2377
01:15:03.221 --> 01:15:04.870
<v Speaker 1>Who knows what if you gave him my beginning,</v>

2378
01:15:04.900 --> 01:15:05.620
<v Speaker 1>what if there was,</v>

2379
01:15:05.620 --> 01:15:07.960
<v Speaker 1>or what if we developed like an actual,</v>

2380
01:15:08.230 --> 01:15:08.501
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2381
01:15:08.501 --> 01:15:11.680
<v Speaker 1>super cure for addiction and you could like snap him out of it.</v>

2382
01:15:11.710 --> 01:15:12.341
<v Speaker 1>Well listen man,</v>

2383
01:15:12.341 --> 01:15:15.670
<v Speaker 1>I had a guy on my podcast today and he was really interesting.</v>

2384
01:15:15.700 --> 01:15:17.620
<v Speaker 1>Dr. Andrew Hill and uh,</v>

2385
01:15:17.650 --> 01:15:19.060
<v Speaker 1>he's the guy who created this stuff.</v>

2386
01:15:19.061 --> 01:15:20.350
<v Speaker 1>It's like a nootropic blend.</v>

2387
01:15:20.351 --> 01:15:21.790
<v Speaker 1>It's called true brain,</v>

2388
01:15:22.330 --> 01:15:24.280
<v Speaker 1>like three different ones and tribes if you want.</v>

2389
01:15:24.580 --> 01:15:25.001
<v Speaker 1>That was good.</v>

2390
01:15:25.001 --> 01:15:27.550
<v Speaker 1>I had the one with caffeine earlier anyway.</v>

2391
01:15:27.730 --> 01:15:28.121
<v Speaker 1>Very,</v>

2392
01:15:28.121 --> 01:15:28.990
<v Speaker 1>very cool.</v>

2393
01:15:28.991 --> 01:15:32.200
<v Speaker 1>And interesting guy and he was talking about this very thing.</v>

2394
01:15:33.430 --> 01:15:34.263
<v Speaker 1>Well you know,</v>

2395
01:15:34.340 --> 01:15:37.240
<v Speaker 1>and you know this very thing is uh,</v>

2396
01:15:37.390 --> 01:15:38.081
<v Speaker 1>this is uh,</v>

2397
01:15:38.081 --> 01:15:42.030
<v Speaker 1>a lot you know about singularity university Kurzwell and d I think his name is</v>

2398
01:15:42.070 --> 01:15:42.990
<v Speaker 1>Dia Mondelez.</v>

2399
01:15:43.060 --> 01:15:44.320
<v Speaker 1>You wrote this book abundance.</v>

2400
01:15:44.321 --> 01:15:44.601
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2401
01:15:44.601 --> 01:15:46.000
<v Speaker 1>I can never get his name right,</v>

2402
01:15:46.001 --> 01:15:48.220
<v Speaker 1>but so basically the idea is,</v>

2403
01:15:49.600 --> 01:15:50.433
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2404
01:15:51.220 --> 01:15:52.750
<v Speaker 1>what are the world's big problems?</v>

2405
01:15:53.260 --> 01:15:56.920
<v Speaker 1>How do we fix them using the law of accelerating returns?</v>

2406
01:15:57.310 --> 01:16:00.400
<v Speaker 1>And it's really the thing you're doing right now is the most,</v>

2407
01:16:00.430 --> 01:16:00.800
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

2408
01:16:00.800 --> 01:16:03.520
<v Speaker 1>is almost as important as fixing the problem.</v>

2409
01:16:04.360 --> 01:16:09.360
<v Speaker 1>It's like what Tim Ferris told me when he was interviewing like super wealthy</v>

2410
01:16:09.491 --> 01:16:10.324
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

2411
01:16:10.330 --> 01:16:12.550
<v Speaker 1>He said they asked better questions.</v>

2412
01:16:12.970 --> 01:16:13.860
<v Speaker 1>It's the question,</v>

2413
01:16:13.861 --> 01:16:18.430
<v Speaker 1>it's like fearlessly asking the big fucking questions.</v>

2414
01:16:18.431 --> 01:16:23.431
<v Speaker 1>Like what do we do to heal skid row?</v>

2415
01:16:24.670 --> 01:16:29.670
<v Speaker 1>How do you fund wha how do you get fresh water to all the parts of the world</v>

2416
01:16:31.691 --> 01:16:32.910
<v Speaker 1>that are currently drinking diseased?</v>

2417
01:16:32.911 --> 01:16:33.280
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

2418
01:16:33.280 --> 01:16:34.113
<v Speaker 1>how do you do it?</v>

2419
01:16:34.330 --> 01:16:37.360
<v Speaker 1>And how do we use this new technology,</v>

2420
01:16:37.361 --> 01:16:38.700
<v Speaker 1>this new emergent technologies?</v>

2421
01:16:38.701 --> 01:16:40.360
<v Speaker 1>Is it to get that to people?</v>

2422
01:16:40.540 --> 01:16:41.410
<v Speaker 1>Well this was this guy.</v>

2423
01:16:41.420 --> 01:16:46.060
<v Speaker 1>Specialty is one of his specialties is using neurofeedback to cure people of</v>

2424
01:16:46.061 --> 01:16:51.061
<v Speaker 1>Adhd to cure people of all sorts of issues by figuring out a way to give them,</v>

2425
01:16:51.520 --> 01:16:52.360
<v Speaker 1>to empower them,</v>

2426
01:16:52.361 --> 01:16:55.540
<v Speaker 1>how to manipulate their brainwaves all done through technology,</v>

2427
01:16:55.570 --> 01:16:58.900
<v Speaker 1>all legit aboveboard all know woo stuff at all.</v>

2428
01:16:59.140 --> 01:17:01.150
<v Speaker 1>All fascinating biofeedback stuff.</v>

2429
01:17:01.151 --> 01:17:02.740
<v Speaker 1>Super Open minded guy.</v>

2430
01:17:02.900 --> 01:17:07.900
<v Speaker 1>We like really fascinated about the concept of fixing certain addictions and</v>

2431
01:17:08.231 --> 01:17:10.610
<v Speaker 1>weird behaviors by monitoring</v>

2432
01:17:10.640 --> 01:17:13.580
<v Speaker 5>neurofeedback and figuring out how the mind works.</v>

2433
01:17:13.760 --> 01:17:15.170
<v Speaker 5>Really interesting stuff dude.</v>

2434
01:17:15.200 --> 01:17:15.621
<v Speaker 5>Really,</v>

2435
01:17:15.621 --> 01:17:17.000
<v Speaker 5>really cool that some,</v>

2436
01:17:17.030 --> 01:17:18.410
<v Speaker 5>some of this stuff that they've created,</v>

2437
01:17:18.650 --> 01:17:22.730
<v Speaker 5>they've been able to eliminate seizures and people who are epileptic by giving</v>

2438
01:17:22.731 --> 01:17:25.210
<v Speaker 5>them the ability to manipulate the way their their mind more.</v>

2439
01:17:25.250 --> 01:17:25.940
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

2440
01:17:25.940 --> 01:17:27.830
<v Speaker 5>Like changing the gears in your mind,</v>

2441
01:17:27.860 --> 01:17:31.430
<v Speaker 5>teaching you how to manipulate it and move it and train it.</v>

2442
01:17:31.550 --> 01:17:31.910
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

2443
01:17:31.910 --> 01:17:32.331
<v Speaker 5>Really,</v>

2444
01:17:32.331 --> 01:17:34.190
<v Speaker 5>really mainly fascinating stuff.</v>

2445
01:17:34.250 --> 01:17:36.890
<v Speaker 5>So when you know that guys like that are out there that are doing this kind of</v>

2446
01:17:36.891 --> 01:17:37.630
<v Speaker 5>shit,</v>

2447
01:17:37.630 --> 01:17:39.470
<v Speaker 5>it's like Ibogaine is one,</v>

2448
01:17:39.471 --> 01:17:40.850
<v Speaker 5>but he was talking about a bunch of things.</v>

2449
01:17:41.150 --> 01:17:42.260
<v Speaker 5>He was telling a bunch of things.</v>

2450
01:17:42.261 --> 01:17:44.930
<v Speaker 5>Even sometimes shock therapy when he says is,</v>

2451
01:17:44.931 --> 01:17:49.340
<v Speaker 5>it's what seems to need to to happen is it needs to be a complete reset of the</v>

2452
01:17:49.341 --> 01:17:49.970
<v Speaker 5>system.</v>

2453
01:17:49.970 --> 01:17:51.140
<v Speaker 5>Then he said a bunch of medical terms,</v>

2454
01:17:51.141 --> 01:17:51.974
<v Speaker 5>I don't remember.</v>

2455
01:17:52.050 --> 01:17:54.860
<v Speaker 5>I'll have to go back over and listened to exactly how he described it.</v>

2456
01:17:54.861 --> 01:17:55.694
<v Speaker 5>It happens,</v>

2457
01:17:55.790 --> 01:17:59.480
<v Speaker 5>but he said that these transformative experiences are like very,</v>

2458
01:17:59.481 --> 01:18:01.670
<v Speaker 5>very important for resetting and reshaping.</v>

2459
01:18:01.671 --> 01:18:02.720
<v Speaker 5>Essentially what we've been saying,</v>

2460
01:18:02.721 --> 01:18:04.550
<v Speaker 5>it's like you operate on momentum.</v>

2461
01:18:04.850 --> 01:18:06.070
<v Speaker 5>You just like got the momentum,</v>

2462
01:18:06.090 --> 01:18:07.400
<v Speaker 5>the world clipping it,</v>

2463
01:18:07.401 --> 01:18:08.180
<v Speaker 5>your heels,</v>

2464
01:18:08.180 --> 01:18:09.980
<v Speaker 5>and it's almost like you can't get out of your own way.</v>

2465
01:18:10.010 --> 01:18:10.701
<v Speaker 5>All right,</v>

2466
01:18:10.701 --> 01:18:15.230
<v Speaker 5>so this guy is talking about it from a neuroscientist standpoint,</v>

2467
01:18:15.290 --> 01:18:19.400
<v Speaker 5>so it's really interesting to get like a guy who really knows what the fuck he's</v>

2468
01:18:19.401 --> 01:18:20.234
<v Speaker 5>talking about.</v>

2469
01:18:20.240 --> 01:18:22.970
<v Speaker 5>Kind of affirm what your suspicions might be,</v>

2470
01:18:23.270 --> 01:18:24.650
<v Speaker 5>some sort of a vague way,</v>

2471
01:18:25.040 --> 01:18:25.540
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

2472
01:18:25.540 --> 01:18:25.691
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2473
01:18:25.691 --> 01:18:30.400
<v Speaker 4>your suspicions being like the reset that comes from a super duper psychedelic</v>

2474
01:18:30.401 --> 01:18:30.930
<v Speaker 4>trip.</v>

2475
01:18:30.930 --> 01:18:31.290
<v Speaker 4>Very.</v>

2476
01:18:31.290 --> 01:18:31.880
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2477
01:18:31.880 --> 01:18:32.200
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

2478
01:18:32.200 --> 01:18:32.681
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

2479
01:18:32.681 --> 01:18:33.190
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2480
01:18:33.190 --> 01:18:33.551
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2481
01:18:33.551 --> 01:18:34.010
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

2482
01:18:34.010 --> 01:18:34.331
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2483
01:18:34.331 --> 01:18:35.950
<v Speaker 4>like you need to step outside yourself.</v>

2484
01:18:35.980 --> 01:18:36.813
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

2485
01:18:37.030 --> 01:18:37.271
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

2486
01:18:37.271 --> 01:18:37.991
<v Speaker 4>or you know,</v>

2487
01:18:37.991 --> 01:18:41.190
<v Speaker 4>the reset that comes when you have some tragic event happened in your life or</v>

2488
01:18:41.191 --> 01:18:42.024
<v Speaker 4>their resets.</v>

2489
01:18:42.160 --> 01:18:42.940
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2490
01:18:42.940 --> 01:18:43.361
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2491
01:18:43.361 --> 01:18:44.890
<v Speaker 4>It's always that moment where you're like,</v>

2492
01:18:44.950 --> 01:18:45.700
<v Speaker 4>oh shit.</v>

2493
01:18:45.700 --> 01:18:46.540
<v Speaker 4>Cause it's like it's,</v>

2494
01:18:46.600 --> 01:18:49.300
<v Speaker 4>it's kind of like a bit,</v>

2495
01:18:49.620 --> 01:18:53.110
<v Speaker 4>a really intense game of make believe that's what society is like everybody's</v>

2496
01:18:53.111 --> 01:18:56.170
<v Speaker 4>playing these roles in it and everyone's really committed to the game and the</v>

2497
01:18:56.171 --> 01:18:58.090
<v Speaker 4>most intense way possible.</v>

2498
01:18:58.480 --> 01:19:01.510
<v Speaker 4>And you get so committed to the particular role that you're playing,</v>

2499
01:19:01.511 --> 01:19:06.511
<v Speaker 4>whatever it may be that you forget that that's just one roll out of an infinite</v>

2500
01:19:07.031 --> 01:19:10.250
<v Speaker 4>number of possible ways that you could be a,</v>

2501
01:19:10.260 --> 01:19:10.931
<v Speaker 4>you could be,</v>

2502
01:19:10.931 --> 01:19:11.291
<v Speaker 4>you could,</v>

2503
01:19:11.291 --> 01:19:16.291
<v Speaker 4>you don't have to be stuck in your current system of predilections or to like</v>

2504
01:19:18.071 --> 01:19:20.410
<v Speaker 4>really like break it down.</v>

2505
01:19:20.450 --> 01:19:24.130
<v Speaker 4>You're people are either attracted to certain people,</v>

2506
01:19:24.131 --> 01:19:25.600
<v Speaker 4>tend to be attracted to,</v>

2507
01:19:25.601 --> 01:19:27.100
<v Speaker 4>things are repelled by things,</v>

2508
01:19:27.220 --> 01:19:27.820
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2509
01:19:27.820 --> 01:19:29.590
<v Speaker 4>And the things that you're attracted to,</v>

2510
01:19:29.680 --> 01:19:33.100
<v Speaker 4>some people aren't attracted to and the things that you're repelled by,</v>

2511
01:19:33.220 --> 01:19:35.170
<v Speaker 4>some people are not repelled by.</v>

2512
01:19:35.171 --> 01:19:36.220
<v Speaker 4>They're attracted to.</v>

2513
01:19:36.221 --> 01:19:37.780
<v Speaker 4>So the question is,</v>

2514
01:19:37.930 --> 01:19:42.930
<v Speaker 4>how much can you change your levels of attraction or desire and aversion?</v>

2515
01:19:44.470 --> 01:19:45.220
<v Speaker 4>How,</v>

2516
01:19:45.220 --> 01:19:47.830
<v Speaker 4>how trapped are you in that,</v>

2517
01:19:47.860 --> 01:19:48.131
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2518
01:19:48.131 --> 01:19:48.341
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>

2519
01:19:48.341 --> 01:19:52.420
<v Speaker 4>in whatever that your particular modality is a I can you get out of that and you</v>

2520
01:19:52.421 --> 01:19:53.560
<v Speaker 4>sure as fuck can.</v>

2521
01:19:53.740 --> 01:19:54.260
<v Speaker 4>And these,</v>

2522
01:19:54.260 --> 01:19:55.570
<v Speaker 4>the psychedelic trips,</v>

2523
01:19:55.960 --> 01:19:56.690
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2524
01:19:56.690 --> 01:19:56.880
<v Speaker 4>are,</v>

2525
01:19:56.880 --> 01:19:57.940
<v Speaker 4>are definitely one way.</v>

2526
01:19:57.941 --> 01:20:00.650
<v Speaker 4>Meditation is another way to figure it out.</v>

2527
01:20:00.770 --> 01:20:00.891
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2528
01:20:00.891 --> 01:20:01.571
<v Speaker 5>It seems like we,</v>

2529
01:20:01.571 --> 01:20:01.851
<v Speaker 5>we,</v>

2530
01:20:01.851 --> 01:20:02.930
<v Speaker 5>whoever we are,</v>

2531
01:20:02.960 --> 01:20:03.711
<v Speaker 5>whoever we are,</v>

2532
01:20:03.711 --> 01:20:06.190
<v Speaker 5>where we are operating on some sort of a,</v>

2533
01:20:06.200 --> 01:20:09.540
<v Speaker 5>an operating system and that operating system is your personality.</v>

2534
01:20:10.050 --> 01:20:10.600
<v Speaker 5>It's like it,</v>

2535
01:20:10.600 --> 01:20:15.600
<v Speaker 5>it allows you to go through this life with some sort of a weird semblance of how</v>

2536
01:20:15.781 --> 01:20:18.300
<v Speaker 5>things are going to be because you know how they just were.</v>

2537
01:20:18.330 --> 01:20:18.870
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

2538
01:20:18.870 --> 01:20:23.190
<v Speaker 5>And it can be empowering or it can be extremely disempowering,</v>

2539
01:20:23.430 --> 01:20:26.430
<v Speaker 5>especially if you don't like certain aspects of your past.</v>

2540
01:20:26.910 --> 01:20:27.151
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2541
01:20:27.151 --> 01:20:27.451
<v Speaker 5>if they,</v>

2542
01:20:27.451 --> 01:20:27.721
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

2543
01:20:27.721 --> 01:20:27.991
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

2544
01:20:27.991 --> 01:20:30.510
<v Speaker 5>you were frustrated with them defining you.</v>

2545
01:20:30.580 --> 01:20:30.990
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2546
01:20:30.990 --> 01:20:35.490
<v Speaker 5>And that's where things like psychedelic experiences can really come in handy</v>

2547
01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:40.710
<v Speaker 5>because they jolt you out of this or the death of a loved one could have a</v>

2548
01:20:40.711 --> 01:20:41.640
<v Speaker 5>similar effect,</v>

2549
01:20:41.970 --> 01:20:42.803
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2550
01:20:43.140 --> 01:20:46.590
<v Speaker 5>obviously much more tragic and much more difficult to get out of.</v>

2551
01:20:46.800 --> 01:20:47.371
<v Speaker 5>But if you know,</v>

2552
01:20:47.371 --> 01:20:49.710
<v Speaker 5>you talk to someone and they lost a loved one,</v>

2553
01:20:50.100 --> 01:20:54.090
<v Speaker 5>regular trivial bullshit is really a knock on affect them the same way it's</v>

2554
01:20:54.091 --> 01:20:56.250
<v Speaker 5>going to affect someone is living a bored life.</v>

2555
01:20:56.550 --> 01:20:58.110
<v Speaker 5>Who wants to gossip about shit.</v>

2556
01:20:58.111 --> 01:20:59.100
<v Speaker 5>If someone loses their mom,</v>

2557
01:20:59.101 --> 01:21:00.750
<v Speaker 5>they don't want to gossip about knots and man,</v>

2558
01:21:01.170 --> 01:21:01.561
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2559
01:21:01.561 --> 01:21:03.750
<v Speaker 5>it's like there's just this reality of things.</v>

2560
01:21:03.751 --> 01:21:04.680
<v Speaker 5>It's totally different.</v>

2561
01:21:04.681 --> 01:21:04.820
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2562
01:21:04.820 --> 01:21:07.110
<v Speaker 5>people can go and when they'd go,</v>

2563
01:21:07.140 --> 01:21:07.531
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

2564
01:21:07.531 --> 01:21:08.520
<v Speaker 5>you're going to miss them,</v>

2565
01:21:08.790 --> 01:21:12.300
<v Speaker 5>you're going to miss your loved ones and then we're all going to get out of this</v>

2566
01:21:12.301 --> 01:21:15.080
<v Speaker 5>one time or another while I,</v>

2567
01:21:15.150 --> 01:21:16.530
<v Speaker 5>while everybody else is going.</v>

2568
01:21:16.700 --> 01:21:16.821
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2569
01:21:16.821 --> 01:21:19.250
<v Speaker 4>that's where it becomes simultaneously tragic.</v>

2570
01:21:19.251 --> 01:21:20.840
<v Speaker 4>And then on top of it,</v>

2571
01:21:20.841 --> 01:21:24.080
<v Speaker 4>there's that DMT thing that you get taught where it's like,</v>

2572
01:21:24.530 --> 01:21:25.220
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>

2573
01:21:25.220 --> 01:21:25.760
<v Speaker 4>yes,</v>

2574
01:21:25.760 --> 01:21:28.850
<v Speaker 4>your mom died gas wise,</v>

2575
01:21:29.420 --> 01:21:33.290
<v Speaker 4>you're going to die too and everyone's going to die and everyone's already died</v>

2576
01:21:33.520 --> 01:21:35.120
<v Speaker 4>and there's so many people have died before you.</v>

2577
01:21:35.330 --> 01:21:36.620
<v Speaker 4>And then somewhere in there,</v>

2578
01:21:37.550 --> 01:21:38.061
<v Speaker 4>cause you know,</v>

2579
01:21:38.061 --> 01:21:38.361
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

2580
01:21:38.361 --> 01:21:39.780
<v Speaker 4>that thing you're talking about there,</v>

2581
01:21:39.960 --> 01:21:44.630
<v Speaker 4>the waking up that happens from it death that involves grief.</v>

2582
01:21:44.990 --> 01:21:45.823
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2583
01:21:46.700 --> 01:21:51.350
<v Speaker 4>that's like the very beginning part of the thing that you're given when a parent</v>

2584
01:21:51.351 --> 01:21:51.920
<v Speaker 4>dies,</v>

2585
01:21:51.920 --> 01:21:55.910
<v Speaker 4>but then the next thing you're given is the after that is pretty fucking</v>

2586
01:21:55.911 --> 01:21:56.744
<v Speaker 4>incredible.</v>

2587
01:21:56.930 --> 01:21:59.200
<v Speaker 4>Which is that you realize that they're in,</v>

2588
01:21:59.420 --> 01:22:01.800
<v Speaker 4>they don't seem to be gone that day.</v>

2589
01:22:01.940 --> 01:22:02.661
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

2590
01:22:02.661 --> 01:22:05.780
<v Speaker 4>That even though that their physical body isn't here anymore,</v>

2591
01:22:06.020 --> 01:22:10.010
<v Speaker 4>you really do feel them in certain ways inside of you.</v>

2592
01:22:10.010 --> 01:22:11.000
<v Speaker 4>Not in a delusional way.</v>

2593
01:22:11.001 --> 01:22:11.420
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

2594
01:22:11.420 --> 01:22:11.661
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2595
01:22:11.661 --> 01:22:14.090
<v Speaker 4>the spirit of my mom is following me around.</v>

2596
01:22:14.091 --> 01:22:18.260
<v Speaker 4>But it feels like you can feel your mom and your heart all the time.</v>

2597
01:22:18.290 --> 01:22:22.790
<v Speaker 4>Always there all the love that they give you all this thing behind all the</v>

2598
01:22:22.791 --> 01:22:23.271
<v Speaker 4>bullshit.</v>

2599
01:22:23.271 --> 01:22:25.730
<v Speaker 4>Everyone's got bullshit cause we're human beings.</v>

2600
01:22:25.731 --> 01:22:26.990
<v Speaker 4>But the thing behind all that,</v>

2601
01:22:26.991 --> 01:22:29.300
<v Speaker 4>that's what sticks around inside of you.</v>

2602
01:22:29.510 --> 01:22:30.230
<v Speaker 4>And it's really,</v>

2603
01:22:30.230 --> 01:22:31.430
<v Speaker 4>it's really beautiful.</v>

2604
01:22:31.610 --> 01:22:33.200
<v Speaker 4>And I think,</v>

2605
01:22:33.201 --> 01:22:33.411
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2606
01:22:33.411 --> 01:22:34.940
<v Speaker 4>whenever I take a DMT trip,</v>

2607
01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:39.230
<v Speaker 4>because my tendency is for my attention to go to the grief for my attention to</v>

2608
01:22:39.231 --> 01:22:40.064
<v Speaker 4>go to the,</v>

2609
01:22:41.030 --> 01:22:41.631
<v Speaker 4>Oh God,</v>

2610
01:22:41.631 --> 01:22:43.940
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to die and I don't want to lose anybody else.</v>

2611
01:22:43.941 --> 01:22:44.180
<v Speaker 4>And I,</v>

2612
01:22:44.180 --> 01:22:46.130
<v Speaker 4>I can't believe how many people are going to die.</v>

2613
01:22:46.131 --> 01:22:48.320
<v Speaker 4>And everyone's going to that my attention habitually,</v>

2614
01:22:48.321 --> 01:22:49.154
<v Speaker 4>it goes to there.</v>

2615
01:22:49.400 --> 01:22:51.380
<v Speaker 4>But whenever you like smoked DMT,</v>

2616
01:22:52.700 --> 01:22:55.160
<v Speaker 4>one thing that I've noticed when I've done it,</v>

2617
01:22:55.670 --> 01:22:56.450
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2618
01:22:56.450 --> 01:22:58.390
<v Speaker 4>outside of whatever the statute of limitations,</v>

2619
01:22:58.400 --> 01:23:00.200
<v Speaker 4>what ways is that,</v>

2620
01:23:00.500 --> 01:23:01.333
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2621
01:23:02.180 --> 01:23:06.400
<v Speaker 4>you're immediately given this view of one of most beautiful things you've ever</v>

2622
01:23:06.401 --> 01:23:10.750
<v Speaker 4>seen in your life and there appears most beautiful,</v>

2623
01:23:10.840 --> 01:23:11.381
<v Speaker 4>the most,</v>

2624
01:23:11.381 --> 01:23:13.100
<v Speaker 4>perhaps the most beautiful.</v>

2625
01:23:13.100 --> 01:23:13.660
<v Speaker 4>Then there's sin.</v>

2626
01:23:13.660 --> 01:23:14.070
<v Speaker 4>There's,</v>

2627
01:23:14.070 --> 01:23:15.130
<v Speaker 4>there's sentience to it.</v>

2628
01:23:15.131 --> 01:23:15.880
<v Speaker 4>It's alive.</v>

2629
01:23:15.880 --> 01:23:16.360
<v Speaker 4>However,</v>

2630
01:23:16.360 --> 01:23:17.230
<v Speaker 4>for whatever reason,</v>

2631
01:23:17.410 --> 01:23:20.050
<v Speaker 4>it does not feel like it's coming from you.</v>

2632
01:23:20.290 --> 01:23:21.910
<v Speaker 4>It feels like it's outside of the things alive.</v>

2633
01:23:23.320 --> 01:23:24.790
<v Speaker 4>And you're like somebody,</v>

2634
01:23:24.820 --> 01:23:26.300
<v Speaker 4>you're like somebody,</v>

2635
01:23:26.301 --> 01:23:30.610
<v Speaker 4>you just had a hard day at work and just walked into the ultimate surprise party</v>

2636
01:23:31.030 --> 01:23:32.380
<v Speaker 4>where everyone's like,</v>

2637
01:23:32.710 --> 01:23:33.543
<v Speaker 4>hi.</v>

2638
01:23:34.360 --> 01:23:34.990
<v Speaker 4>And it's like,</v>

2639
01:23:34.990 --> 01:23:35.950
<v Speaker 4>Oh God,</v>

2640
01:23:35.951 --> 01:23:36.671
<v Speaker 4>it's beautiful,</v>

2641
01:23:36.671 --> 01:23:38.680
<v Speaker 4>but I'm so fucking tired.</v>

2642
01:23:39.490 --> 01:23:42.550
<v Speaker 4>I'm so sad and I feel like shit.</v>

2643
01:23:42.910 --> 01:23:44.110
<v Speaker 4>And it's like the,</v>

2644
01:23:44.111 --> 01:23:44.830
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2645
01:23:44.830 --> 01:23:47.410
<v Speaker 4>the message it gives you is right.</v>

2646
01:23:47.920 --> 01:23:48.753
<v Speaker 4>See,</v>

2647
01:23:48.880 --> 01:23:53.200
<v Speaker 4>you are clinging to this identity of the sad,</v>

2648
01:23:53.410 --> 01:23:54.250
<v Speaker 4>tired,</v>

2649
01:23:54.530 --> 01:23:56.170
<v Speaker 4>unhappy person.</v>

2650
01:23:56.500 --> 01:23:59.380
<v Speaker 4>But if you just let go for a second,</v>

2651
01:23:59.980 --> 01:24:02.320
<v Speaker 4>you're going to have a really good time at this party.</v>

2652
01:24:06.370 --> 01:24:07.060
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2653
01:24:07.060 --> 01:24:10.780
<v Speaker 4>and that's the identity reset that I think that they're talking about and it's</v>

2654
01:24:10.781 --> 01:24:12.610
<v Speaker 4>so possible cause that's a game.</v>

2655
01:24:12.760 --> 01:24:16.990
<v Speaker 4>The game of the hunched over businessman with a briefcase and the weary face in</v>

2656
01:24:16.991 --> 01:24:18.850
<v Speaker 4>the big size and the depressed tweets.</v>

2657
01:24:18.920 --> 01:24:19.210
<v Speaker 4>Ooh.</v>

2658
01:24:19.210 --> 01:24:20.420
<v Speaker 4>Oh Man.</v>

2659
01:24:20.430 --> 01:24:21.520
<v Speaker 4>Just fucking world.</v>

2660
01:24:22.540 --> 01:24:23.321
<v Speaker 4>That's a role.</v>

2661
01:24:23.321 --> 01:24:24.580
<v Speaker 4>You are playing a part.</v>

2662
01:24:24.820 --> 01:24:25.480
<v Speaker 4>You are like,</v>

2663
01:24:25.480 --> 01:24:30.310
<v Speaker 4>you are like fucking Daniel Day Lewis and you are committing fully to the part</v>

2664
01:24:30.311 --> 01:24:33.100
<v Speaker 4>of the Moby depressed businessman,</v>

2665
01:24:33.130 --> 01:24:33.940
<v Speaker 4>businessman.</v>

2666
01:24:33.940 --> 01:24:37.480
<v Speaker 4>That's a part and you're winning awards for it left and right in the form of all</v>

2667
01:24:37.481 --> 01:24:41.020
<v Speaker 4>the people who secretly hate you or all the people who are,</v>

2668
01:24:41.100 --> 01:24:41.320
<v Speaker 4>who,</v>

2669
01:24:41.320 --> 01:24:43.030
<v Speaker 4>who you make feel sad or all the,</v>

2670
01:24:43.300 --> 01:24:43.900
<v Speaker 4>all the,</v>

2671
01:24:43.900 --> 01:24:45.480
<v Speaker 4>you're having a real effect in the world.</v>

2672
01:24:45.670 --> 01:24:46.211
<v Speaker 3>Well when you,</v>

2673
01:24:46.211 --> 01:24:47.620
<v Speaker 3>when you try to sell someone something,</v>

2674
01:24:47.621 --> 01:24:49.660
<v Speaker 3>you were in a suit and tie or aren't you doing a ritual dance?</v>

2675
01:24:49.800 --> 01:24:50.633
<v Speaker 4>Yes you are.</v>

2676
01:24:51.030 --> 01:24:51.421
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

2677
01:24:51.421 --> 01:24:53.400
<v Speaker 4>you are a hypnotic dance.</v>

2678
01:24:53.460 --> 01:24:57.150
<v Speaker 4>You're throwing up those fucking tail feathers and sucking in the gullible.</v>

2679
01:24:57.180 --> 01:24:57.481
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2680
01:24:57.481 --> 01:24:58.090
<v Speaker 4>it's a dance.</v>

2681
01:24:58.090 --> 01:24:58.923
<v Speaker 3>Let me tell you something,</v>

2682
01:24:58.930 --> 01:24:59.890
<v Speaker 3>I can make you a deal.</v>

2683
01:24:59.891 --> 01:25:02.550
<v Speaker 3>And then when these 2014 F-150,</v>

2684
01:25:02.560 --> 01:25:04.110
<v Speaker 3>they changed the structure to aluminum.</v>

2685
01:25:04.120 --> 01:25:04.631
<v Speaker 3>But I'll tell you what,</v>

2686
01:25:04.631 --> 01:25:05.590
<v Speaker 3>I don't like it buddy.</v>

2687
01:25:06.010 --> 01:25:07.120
<v Speaker 3>I like the old steel.</v>

2688
01:25:07.150 --> 01:25:09.610
<v Speaker 3>I like the good old steel and I'm wearing a real good deal on that.</v>

2689
01:25:09.640 --> 01:25:10.050
<v Speaker 3>Joe.</v>

2690
01:25:10.050 --> 01:25:11.040
<v Speaker 3>You have a way of talking to him.</v>

2691
01:25:11.550 --> 01:25:12.280
<v Speaker 4>Ah,</v>

2692
01:25:12.280 --> 01:25:13.113
<v Speaker 4>ah.</v>

2693
01:25:13.170 --> 01:25:14.340
<v Speaker 4>That's what salesmanship is.</v>

2694
01:25:14.370 --> 01:25:15.240
<v Speaker 4>It's really good acting.</v>

2695
01:25:15.480 --> 01:25:15.751
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2696
01:25:15.751 --> 01:25:17.310
<v Speaker 4>And that's what being a pickup artist is.</v>

2697
01:25:17.311 --> 01:25:18.144
<v Speaker 4>And that's what,</v>

2698
01:25:18.300 --> 01:25:18.481
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2699
01:25:18.481 --> 01:25:19.231
<v Speaker 4>it's the same idea.</v>

2700
01:25:19.231 --> 01:25:20.790
<v Speaker 4>It's pickup crates.</v>

2701
01:25:21.330 --> 01:25:22.710
<v Speaker 4>It's trickery or it's like,</v>

2702
01:25:23.190 --> 01:25:23.670
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2703
01:25:23.670 --> 01:25:24.090
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2704
01:25:24.090 --> 01:25:24.331
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

2705
01:25:24.331 --> 01:25:26.790
<v Speaker 4>but a cool thing to realize is,</v>

2706
01:25:26.791 --> 01:25:29.490
<v Speaker 4>and it's a fun thing to realize and it's a blast when ms thing to realize,</v>

2707
01:25:29.520 --> 01:25:30.110
<v Speaker 4>and it's just,</v>

2708
01:25:30.110 --> 01:25:30.570
<v Speaker 4>for me,</v>

2709
01:25:30.570 --> 01:25:31.361
<v Speaker 4>it's blasphemy.</v>

2710
01:25:31.361 --> 01:25:36.090
<v Speaker 4>It's because you want to believe that you're a victim and you want to believe,</v>

2711
01:25:36.091 --> 01:25:38.010
<v Speaker 4>nice to feel like you can blame other people.</v>

2712
01:25:38.110 --> 01:25:38.943
<v Speaker 4>It's the best.</v>

2713
01:25:39.090 --> 01:25:43.170
<v Speaker 4>It's the best to come home and split the fucking briefcase down and take the PSI</v>

2714
01:25:43.440 --> 01:25:44.850
<v Speaker 4>and sink down into your couch.</v>

2715
01:25:44.851 --> 01:25:48.300
<v Speaker 4>Now you've got an excuse to slurp back that fucking whiskey that you've been</v>

2716
01:25:48.570 --> 01:25:50.250
<v Speaker 4>trying to pour all over your,</v>

2717
01:25:50.510 --> 01:25:50.820
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2718
01:25:50.820 --> 01:25:51.720
<v Speaker 4>happiness.</v>

2719
01:25:51.900 --> 01:25:52.560
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2720
01:25:52.560 --> 01:25:54.930
<v Speaker 4>it's frozen under the fucking ice,</v>

2721
01:25:55.300 --> 01:25:55.600
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2722
01:25:55.600 --> 01:25:56.880
<v Speaker 4>of the role that you're playing.</v>

2723
01:25:57.030 --> 01:25:57.631
<v Speaker 4>It's fun.</v>

2724
01:25:57.631 --> 01:25:58.620
<v Speaker 4>It's fun to be like that,</v>

2725
01:25:58.621 --> 01:26:00.150
<v Speaker 4>but the psychedelic,</v>

2726
01:26:00.270 --> 01:26:00.481
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2727
01:26:00.481 --> 01:26:00.721
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2728
01:26:00.721 --> 01:26:01.111
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2729
01:26:01.111 --> 01:26:01.670
<v Speaker 4>the psychic,</v>

2730
01:26:01.670 --> 01:26:02.520
<v Speaker 4>the mushroom,</v>

2731
01:26:03.110 --> 01:26:05.330
<v Speaker 4>the psychedelic reminds you.</v>

2732
01:26:05.600 --> 01:26:07.070
<v Speaker 4>It won't let you get away with that.</v>

2733
01:26:07.100 --> 01:26:07.611
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

2734
01:26:07.611 --> 01:26:07.841
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2735
01:26:07.841 --> 01:26:07.971
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2736
01:26:07.971 --> 01:26:08.780
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

2737
01:26:08.780 --> 01:26:10.220
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry friend,</v>

2738
01:26:10.610 --> 01:26:12.200
<v Speaker 4>but you're in the garden of Eden.</v>

2739
01:26:12.530 --> 01:26:15.650
<v Speaker 4>It's beautiful here and perfect.</v>

2740
01:26:15.651 --> 01:26:18.140
<v Speaker 4>And I'll get ready for some really bad news.</v>

2741
01:26:18.770 --> 01:26:20.000
<v Speaker 4>You're perfect.</v>

2742
01:26:20.120 --> 01:26:21.290
<v Speaker 4>We love you.</v>

2743
01:26:21.350 --> 01:26:22.580
<v Speaker 4>You're wonderful.</v>

2744
01:26:22.670 --> 01:26:23.750
<v Speaker 4>You're forgiven.</v>

2745
01:26:24.020 --> 01:26:25.610
<v Speaker 4>You haven't done anything bad.</v>

2746
01:26:25.850 --> 01:26:29.090
<v Speaker 4>Everything that you think is bad is something that you did when you're in a kind</v>

2747
01:26:29.091 --> 01:26:29.780
<v Speaker 4>of dream,</v>

2748
01:26:29.780 --> 01:26:30.770
<v Speaker 4>you were sleepwalking.</v>

2749
01:26:31.160 --> 01:26:32.150
<v Speaker 4>We don't care.</v>

2750
01:26:32.360 --> 01:26:33.860
<v Speaker 4>We love you no matter what.</v>

2751
01:26:34.100 --> 01:26:36.890
<v Speaker 4>And whenever you're ready to accept that we're right here for you.</v>

2752
01:26:37.100 --> 01:26:39.080
<v Speaker 4>And that sucks because if you're really hooked,</v>

2753
01:26:39.081 --> 01:26:43.970
<v Speaker 4>I'm being Elliot Smith and you're really getting off on that fucking dark hell</v>

2754
01:26:43.971 --> 01:26:44.804
<v Speaker 4>that you're in.</v>

2755
01:26:44.840 --> 01:26:46.610
<v Speaker 4>It's a little annoying to realize like,</v>

2756
01:26:46.611 --> 01:26:47.240
<v Speaker 4>Yo,</v>

2757
01:26:47.240 --> 01:26:49.040
<v Speaker 4>you're fucking given away the thing.</v>

2758
01:26:49.040 --> 01:26:51.950
<v Speaker 4>Mandel let people know I'm committed to this.</v>

2759
01:26:52.100 --> 01:26:53.570
<v Speaker 4>It's like they say Daniel Day Lewis,</v>

2760
01:26:53.840 --> 01:26:58.460
<v Speaker 4>he had to get carried around during my left foot by the crew cause he committed</v>

2761
01:26:58.461 --> 01:27:01.490
<v Speaker 4>so much to the role of being a paraplegic.</v>

2762
01:27:01.670 --> 01:27:04.220
<v Speaker 4>Did they had to carry him from one place to the next?</v>

2763
01:27:04.460 --> 01:27:05.810
<v Speaker 4>Cause the way he acts,</v>

2764
01:27:06.080 --> 01:27:07.850
<v Speaker 4>it's incredibly disruptive to him.</v>

2765
01:27:07.851 --> 01:27:12.560
<v Speaker 4>If people talk to him is Daniel Day Lewis that he wants to be the role that he's</v>

2766
01:27:12.561 --> 01:27:13.100
<v Speaker 4>in.</v>

2767
01:27:13.100 --> 01:27:14.180
<v Speaker 4>So in the same way,</v>

2768
01:27:14.540 --> 01:27:17.450
<v Speaker 4>when DMT comes along and is like,</v>

2769
01:27:17.540 --> 01:27:18.373
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2770
01:27:18.980 --> 01:27:20.390
<v Speaker 4>Mr. Lewis,</v>

2771
01:27:20.450 --> 01:27:21.200
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2772
01:27:21.200 --> 01:27:22.790
<v Speaker 4>that is not who I am.</v>

2773
01:27:23.150 --> 01:27:28.150
<v Speaker 4>I am a depressed man who is middle aged and is terrified and is trying to</v>

2774
01:27:28.281 --> 01:27:29.150
<v Speaker 4>control people.</v>

2775
01:27:29.151 --> 01:27:31.070
<v Speaker 4>You aren't acting the way I want them to act.</v>

2776
01:27:31.340 --> 01:27:33.320
<v Speaker 4>I am not fucking Mr Trussell,</v>

2777
01:27:33.321 --> 01:27:34.370
<v Speaker 4>whoever you just called me.</v>

2778
01:27:34.670 --> 01:27:36.170
<v Speaker 4>I'm not a being of love.</v>

2779
01:27:36.171 --> 01:27:37.610
<v Speaker 4>I am a being of darkness.</v>

2780
01:27:37.611 --> 01:27:37.971
<v Speaker 4>And it's like,</v>

2781
01:27:37.971 --> 01:27:38.804
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2782
01:27:39.140 --> 01:27:39.771
<v Speaker 4>you're just playing.</v>

2783
01:27:39.771 --> 01:27:40.581
<v Speaker 4>Make believe,</v>

2784
01:27:40.581 --> 01:27:41.300
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

2785
01:27:41.300 --> 01:27:42.920
<v Speaker 4>You don't have to keep playing that.</v>

2786
01:27:42.980 --> 01:27:44.120
<v Speaker 4>You have shiny shoes.</v>

2787
01:27:44.630 --> 01:27:46.370
<v Speaker 4>You have shiny slippery shoes on.</v>

2788
01:27:46.430 --> 01:27:47.180
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2789
01:27:47.180 --> 01:27:48.440
<v Speaker 4>Why do you have a tie clip on?</v>

2790
01:27:49.250 --> 01:27:49.670
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2791
01:27:49.670 --> 01:27:50.670
<v Speaker 4>Why do you have that?</v>

2792
01:27:50.740 --> 01:27:52.010
<v Speaker 4>Why are you wearing a fucking,</v>

2793
01:27:52.520 --> 01:27:54.020
<v Speaker 4>why are you wearing a noose?</v>

2794
01:27:54.021 --> 01:27:55.700
<v Speaker 4>The geometric patterns on it.</v>

2795
01:27:56.090 --> 01:27:57.230
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2796
01:27:57.380 --> 01:27:57.621
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2797
01:27:57.621 --> 01:27:59.420
<v Speaker 3>that's one of the things that those secret service suits,</v>

2798
01:27:59.900 --> 01:28:00.441
<v Speaker 3>like any guy,</v>

2799
01:28:00.441 --> 01:28:01.910
<v Speaker 3>what has to wear a tie on the job.</v>

2800
01:28:01.911 --> 01:28:03.020
<v Speaker 3>They all have clip ons.</v>

2801
01:28:03.021 --> 01:28:04.250
<v Speaker 3>You can't choke those guys.</v>

2802
01:28:04.410 --> 01:28:05.243
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>

2803
01:28:05.300 --> 01:28:06.140
<v Speaker 3>that makes sense.</v>

2804
01:28:06.750 --> 01:28:07.583
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2805
01:28:07.610 --> 01:28:07.790
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

2806
01:28:07.790 --> 01:28:08.200
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

2807
01:28:08.200 --> 01:28:10.130
<v Speaker 4>if you're a business is not being a businessman,</v>

2808
01:28:10.160 --> 01:28:12.470
<v Speaker 4>is any better or worse than any other role that you're playing?</v>

2809
01:28:12.471 --> 01:28:15.320
<v Speaker 4>It's what's bad is when you forget that you're playing the role.</v>

2810
01:28:16.150 --> 01:28:16.391
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2811
01:28:16.391 --> 01:28:16.840
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2812
01:28:16.840 --> 01:28:21.340
<v Speaker 3>the realization that you've come to wall on a psychedelic trip,</v>

2813
01:28:22.270 --> 01:28:26.470
<v Speaker 3>that'll have to be almost the realization that everybody comes to when</v>

2814
01:28:26.471 --> 01:28:31.471
<v Speaker 3>technology and an information like they meet head on when we hit,</v>

2815
01:28:32.350 --> 01:28:33.161
<v Speaker 3>when we hit the puff,</v>

2816
01:28:33.161 --> 01:28:34.120
<v Speaker 3>the fork in the road,</v>

2817
01:28:34.240 --> 01:28:35.290
<v Speaker 3>the tip of the spear.</v>

2818
01:28:35.590 --> 01:28:40.590
<v Speaker 3>If you get to the part where both sides are moving in like an unstoppable pace,</v>

2819
01:28:44.020 --> 01:28:45.130
<v Speaker 3>there's gotta be a way,</v>

2820
01:28:45.510 --> 01:28:47.830
<v Speaker 3>has got gotta be a way to bring everybody into the party.</v>

2821
01:28:48.490 --> 01:28:48.940
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2822
01:28:48.940 --> 01:28:49.600
<v Speaker 3>And if you don't,</v>

2823
01:28:49.600 --> 01:28:50.433
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>

2824
01:28:50.470 --> 01:28:52.180
<v Speaker 3>if more people don't know about it,</v>

2825
01:28:52.240 --> 01:28:54.120
<v Speaker 3>if more people don't experience this,</v>

2826
01:28:54.190 --> 01:28:59.190
<v Speaker 3>this pause in history where people across the entire planet are waking up and</v>

2827
01:29:01.561 --> 01:29:01.950
<v Speaker 3>saying,</v>

2828
01:29:01.950 --> 01:29:02.310
<v Speaker 3>wait</v>

2829
01:29:02.310 --> 01:29:02.550
<v Speaker 5>a minute,</v>

2830
01:29:02.550 --> 01:29:03.271
<v Speaker 5>this thing,</v>

2831
01:29:03.271 --> 01:29:07.110
<v Speaker 5>this whole thing might not be what we think is this whole thing might not be</v>

2832
01:29:07.111 --> 01:29:07.944
<v Speaker 5>what we think it is.</v>

2833
01:29:08.460 --> 01:29:13.460
<v Speaker 5>This crazy desire that we have is finite life forms to build a nest egg and put</v>

2834
01:29:13.561 --> 01:29:17.400
<v Speaker 5>together some fucking structure somewhere that you're going to stuff with shit</v>

2835
01:29:17.910 --> 01:29:20.430
<v Speaker 5>and doing so in doing self feed.</v>

2836
01:29:20.431 --> 01:29:21.840
<v Speaker 5>This weird machine,</v>

2837
01:29:21.841 --> 01:29:23.300
<v Speaker 5>you're throwing money into it.</v>

2838
01:29:23.310 --> 01:29:26.370
<v Speaker 5>It's chewing the money up and it's about to fucking give birth.</v>

2839
01:29:26.371 --> 01:29:30.830
<v Speaker 5>It's got its robot legs in the air and it's robot pussies quiver and it's indeed</v>

2840
01:29:30.860 --> 01:29:33.390
<v Speaker 5>just just throwing money into it's robot tits.</v>

2841
01:29:33.480 --> 01:29:33.751
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2842
01:29:33.751 --> 01:29:35.460
<v Speaker 5>and it's just chewing that robe up,</v>

2843
01:29:35.461 --> 01:29:37.920
<v Speaker 5>money up and it's ready to give birth.</v>

2844
01:29:38.340 --> 01:29:40.680
<v Speaker 5>It's ready to give birth as some sentience,</v>

2845
01:29:40.681 --> 01:29:45.310
<v Speaker 5>super intelligent thing that will then give birth to other sentience and</v>

2846
01:29:45.320 --> 01:29:50.040
<v Speaker 5>superintelligent things figured out a way to completely rewire the entire earth.</v>

2847
01:29:50.280 --> 01:29:53.970
<v Speaker 5>All of our waste will then be converted into a positive.</v>

2848
01:29:54.160 --> 01:29:54.420
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2849
01:29:54.420 --> 01:29:55.860
<v Speaker 5>Everything that's negative,</v>

2850
01:29:55.861 --> 01:30:00.370
<v Speaker 5>all pollution will be engineered out of commission and into some sort of,</v>

2851
01:30:00.371 --> 01:30:00.840
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2852
01:30:00.840 --> 01:30:01.051
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2853
01:30:01.051 --> 01:30:06.051
<v Speaker 5>oxygen cleaning machine that it fuels itself on pollution to the point where it</v>

2854
01:30:06.871 --> 01:30:08.430
<v Speaker 5>gets to a certain point and when it runs out,</v>

2855
01:30:08.431 --> 01:30:09.720
<v Speaker 5>just spits flowers.</v>

2856
01:30:10.080 --> 01:30:10.891
<v Speaker 5>When it runs out,</v>

2857
01:30:10.891 --> 01:30:14.310
<v Speaker 5>it takes whatever remnants and shoots flowers into the sky.</v>

2858
01:30:14.311 --> 01:30:15.144
<v Speaker 5>And as where you walk,</v>

2859
01:30:15.180 --> 01:30:18.000
<v Speaker 5>you're gonna have to rose petals falling from the street because the sky's going</v>

2860
01:30:18.001 --> 01:30:19.110
<v Speaker 5>to be perfectly clear.</v>

2861
01:30:19.350 --> 01:30:19.741
<v Speaker 5>Sure.</v>

2862
01:30:19.741 --> 01:30:20.290
<v Speaker 5>North.</v>

2863
01:30:20.290 --> 01:30:20.920
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2864
01:30:20.920 --> 01:30:21.671
<v Speaker 4>Why not?</v>

2865
01:30:21.671 --> 01:30:22.180
<v Speaker 4>Why not?</v>

2866
01:30:22.180 --> 01:30:22.900
<v Speaker 4>Why not?</v>

2867
01:30:22.900 --> 01:30:23.211
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

2868
01:30:23.211 --> 01:30:23.470
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

2869
01:30:23.470 --> 01:30:23.801
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2870
01:30:23.801 --> 01:30:28.660
<v Speaker 4>if you look at what's going on now compared to what was going on a thousand</v>

2871
01:30:28.660 --> 01:30:28.840
<v Speaker 4>years ago,</v>

2872
01:30:28.840 --> 01:30:29.860
<v Speaker 4>this is a wonderful,</v>

2873
01:30:29.861 --> 01:30:30.760
<v Speaker 4>wonderful time.</v>

2874
01:30:30.880 --> 01:30:31.780
<v Speaker 4>And also in this book,</v>

2875
01:30:31.781 --> 01:30:32.614
<v Speaker 4>abundance,</v>

2876
01:30:32.710 --> 01:30:33.070
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2877
01:30:33.070 --> 01:30:35.180
<v Speaker 4>highly recommend it for anybody using the,</v>

2878
01:30:35.190 --> 01:30:36.970
<v Speaker 4>not feeling like you're in hell.</v>

2879
01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:37.660
<v Speaker 4>Who wrote it?</v>

2880
01:30:37.660 --> 01:30:38.890
<v Speaker 4>I can't pronounce his name.</v>

2881
01:30:38.920 --> 01:30:39.550
<v Speaker 4>Can you look it up?</v>

2882
01:30:39.550 --> 01:30:40.150
<v Speaker 4>I'll look it up.</v>

2883
01:30:40.150 --> 01:30:44.440
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] as he's one of the cofounders of Singularity University,</v>

2884
01:30:44.530 --> 01:30:45.280
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2885
01:30:45.280 --> 01:30:46.600
<v Speaker 4>let me look it up real quick.</v>

2886
01:30:46.990 --> 01:30:48.990
<v Speaker 4>And he's one of the guys that thinks it's all going to be rosy.</v>

2887
01:30:49.060 --> 01:30:49.391
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2888
01:30:49.391 --> 01:30:49.541
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2889
01:30:49.541 --> 01:30:50.890
<v Speaker 4>it's not like they think everything's,</v>

2890
01:30:50.950 --> 01:30:52.360
<v Speaker 4>they recognize that.</v>

2891
01:30:52.361 --> 01:30:53.194
<v Speaker 4>See this,</v>

2892
01:30:53.510 --> 01:30:57.340
<v Speaker 4>the thing about the Peter Diamandis,</v>

2893
01:30:57.460 --> 01:30:58.000
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

2894
01:30:58.000 --> 01:30:58.231
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>

2895
01:30:58.231 --> 01:31:01.690
<v Speaker 4>the thing about this law of accelerating returns is it doesn't just apply to</v>

2896
01:31:01.691 --> 01:31:02.321
<v Speaker 4>great things.</v>

2897
01:31:02.321 --> 01:31:03.970
<v Speaker 4>It also applies to chaos.</v>

2898
01:31:03.971 --> 01:31:04.804
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

2899
01:31:04.990 --> 01:31:05.381
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

2900
01:31:05.381 --> 01:31:06.910
<v Speaker 4>so these guys,</v>

2901
01:31:07.090 --> 01:31:07.540
<v Speaker 4>these new,</v>

2902
01:31:07.540 --> 01:31:08.140
<v Speaker 4>there was a hook.</v>

2903
01:31:08.140 --> 01:31:10.480
<v Speaker 4>These guys understand that the collapse,</v>

2904
01:31:10.960 --> 01:31:15.640
<v Speaker 4>the collapse is going to have the same kind of velocity is the whatever this</v>

2905
01:31:15.641 --> 01:31:16.151
<v Speaker 4>thing is.</v>

2906
01:31:16.151 --> 01:31:16.420
<v Speaker 4>So that,</v>

2907
01:31:16.420 --> 01:31:17.860
<v Speaker 4>I don't think they're so naive about it,</v>

2908
01:31:18.130 --> 01:31:18.963
<v Speaker 4>they're just,</v>

2909
01:31:19.900 --> 01:31:24.900
<v Speaker 4>they've just recognize this what we're calling up a baby being born.</v>

2910
01:31:25.240 --> 01:31:27.130
<v Speaker 4>They've recognized the things being born.</v>

2911
01:31:27.310 --> 01:31:30.100
<v Speaker 4>They can kind of predict what phase of birth it's in.</v>

2912
01:31:30.370 --> 01:31:31.600
<v Speaker 4>And based on that prediction,</v>

2913
01:31:31.601 --> 01:31:34.020
<v Speaker 4>they can predict what's coming out next.</v>

2914
01:31:34.021 --> 01:31:35.290
<v Speaker 4>And based on that prediction,</v>

2915
01:31:35.500 --> 01:31:40.500
<v Speaker 4>they can start working right now to solve some of the big problems out there.</v>

2916
01:31:40.721 --> 01:31:43.030
<v Speaker 4>And one of the things he says is that in a,</v>

2917
01:31:43.031 --> 01:31:44.410
<v Speaker 4>in a lot of countries,</v>

2918
01:31:44.830 --> 01:31:45.131
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2919
01:31:45.131 --> 01:31:45.351
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2920
01:31:45.351 --> 01:31:50.020
<v Speaker 4>the amount of people that have phones right now is just insane or the amount it</v>

2921
01:31:50.021 --> 01:31:50.854
<v Speaker 4>costs.</v>

2922
01:31:51.280 --> 01:31:51.941
<v Speaker 4>One example,</v>

2923
01:31:51.941 --> 01:31:52.774
<v Speaker 4>he gives us this,</v>

2924
01:31:52.870 --> 01:31:56.890
<v Speaker 4>the amount it would have cost to light your house,</v>

2925
01:31:57.290 --> 01:31:57.670
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2926
01:31:57.670 --> 01:32:01.060
<v Speaker 4>prior to electricity with like wax candles or,</v>

2927
01:32:01.120 --> 01:32:01.600
<v Speaker 4>or,</v>

2928
01:32:01.600 --> 01:32:06.600
<v Speaker 4>or lanterns is so much more expensive and the amount of cost to light your house</v>

2929
01:32:06.701 --> 01:32:07.001
<v Speaker 4>now,</v>

2930
01:32:07.001 --> 01:32:08.110
<v Speaker 4>it's so much cheaper.</v>

2931
01:32:08.320 --> 01:32:11.770
<v Speaker 4>The technology of lighting is accessible to almost,</v>

2932
01:32:12.010 --> 01:32:17.010
<v Speaker 4>almost all levels of economy except for the ultra super,</v>

2933
01:32:17.290 --> 01:32:18.123
<v Speaker 4>very,</v>

2934
01:32:18.190 --> 01:32:18.701
<v Speaker 4>very,</v>

2935
01:32:18.701 --> 01:32:19.271
<v Speaker 4>very,</v>

2936
01:32:19.271 --> 01:32:19.901
<v Speaker 4>very poor.</v>

2937
01:32:19.901 --> 01:32:21.070
<v Speaker 4>And there's a lot of them out there.</v>

2938
01:32:21.071 --> 01:32:25.120
<v Speaker 4>But having a light bulb in your shack can still happen.</v>

2939
01:32:25.390 --> 01:32:27.430
<v Speaker 4>And if you have a light bulb in your shack,</v>

2940
01:32:27.730 --> 01:32:32.140
<v Speaker 4>you're doing a hell of a lot better than a lot of people used to have to have</v>

2941
01:32:32.141 --> 01:32:33.820
<v Speaker 4>tallow or I can't remember what he called it,</v>

2942
01:32:33.821 --> 01:32:35.290
<v Speaker 4>like old school wax.</v>

2943
01:32:35.530 --> 01:32:37.030
<v Speaker 4>And there's a lot of other examples,</v>

2944
01:32:37.031 --> 01:32:38.170
<v Speaker 4>which is our,</v>

2945
01:32:38.580 --> 01:32:38.800
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

2946
01:32:38.800 --> 01:32:39.950
<v Speaker 4>part of what he's saying is there's,</v>

2947
01:32:39.960 --> 01:32:43.030
<v Speaker 4>if there's a few problems we have to solve right now,</v>

2948
01:32:43.570 --> 01:32:44.403
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2949
01:32:45.100 --> 01:32:46.330
<v Speaker 4>one of them is clean water.</v>

2950
01:32:46.570 --> 01:32:49.450
<v Speaker 4>We've got to get clean water for the huge,</v>

2951
01:32:49.780 --> 01:32:50.880
<v Speaker 4>so many people in the world,</v>

2952
01:32:50.890 --> 01:32:51.611
<v Speaker 4>you just don't have it.</v>

2953
01:32:51.611 --> 01:32:53.740
<v Speaker 4>They're drinking poison every day.</v>

2954
01:32:53.890 --> 01:32:55.960
<v Speaker 4>So that's something we've got to figure out.</v>

2955
01:32:56.230 --> 01:32:56.471
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2956
01:32:56.471 --> 01:32:58.540
<v Speaker 4>and then there's a few other biggies like that.</v>

2957
01:32:58.750 --> 01:33:03.750
<v Speaker 4>And people I came are of the opinion that these are very solvable problems based</v>

2958
01:33:04.211 --> 01:33:05.680
<v Speaker 4>on current predictions,</v>

2959
01:33:06.070 --> 01:33:06.281
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2960
01:33:06.281 --> 01:33:09.130
<v Speaker 4>involving the direction that technology technology is going in.</v>

2961
01:33:09.370 --> 01:33:12.070
<v Speaker 4>And Kurzweil's fucking predictions are coming true,</v>

2962
01:33:12.071 --> 01:33:12.640
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

2963
01:33:12.640 --> 01:33:14.440
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of people who roll their eyes at him.</v>

2964
01:33:14.800 --> 01:33:17.050
<v Speaker 4>Wazniak recently came out and said,</v>

2965
01:33:17.500 --> 01:33:17.831
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2966
01:33:17.831 --> 01:33:19.390
<v Speaker 4>you used to think that staff was crap,</v>

2967
01:33:19.391 --> 01:33:21.010
<v Speaker 4>but now he's realizing it's true.</v>

2968
01:33:21.370 --> 01:33:21.970
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2969
01:33:21.970 --> 01:33:23.020
<v Speaker 4>this is happening.</v>

2970
01:33:23.230 --> 01:33:24.520
<v Speaker 4>It's definitely happening.</v>

2971
01:33:24.700 --> 01:33:25.970
<v Speaker 4>And folks like Dia,</v>

2972
01:33:25.971 --> 01:33:27.020
<v Speaker 4>Mondelez or uh,</v>

2973
01:33:27.280 --> 01:33:30.280
<v Speaker 4>they're trying to steer the boat in the direction of Utopia because they know</v>

2974
01:33:30.281 --> 01:33:31.120
<v Speaker 4>that it can be done.</v>

2975
01:33:31.510 --> 01:33:32.020
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

2976
01:33:32.020 --> 01:33:32.650
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2977
01:33:32.650 --> 01:33:33.290
<v Speaker 4>wow.</v>

2978
01:33:33.290 --> 01:33:33.440
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2979
01:33:33.440 --> 01:33:33.850
<v Speaker 3>it's cool.</v>

2980
01:33:33.850 --> 01:33:34.061
<v Speaker 3>People,</v>

2981
01:33:34.061 --> 01:33:35.380
<v Speaker 3>I've heard people criticize,</v>

2982
01:33:35.910 --> 01:33:36.520
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2983
01:33:36.520 --> 01:33:39.610
<v Speaker 3>Kurzweil's idea is saying that he doesn't really understand human biology.</v>

2984
01:33:39.611 --> 01:33:41.260
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't understand the biology of the brain.</v>

2985
01:33:41.770 --> 01:33:42.730
<v Speaker 3>But I think his point,</v>

2986
01:33:42.731 --> 01:33:45.700
<v Speaker 3>his point is I think is that it's not gonna matter.</v>

2987
01:33:45.820 --> 01:33:48.220
<v Speaker 3>You're not going to have to be able to replicate everything that the brain does</v>

2988
01:33:48.221 --> 01:33:52.000
<v Speaker 3>and how it does it in order to recreate consciousness that consciousness may be</v>

2989
01:33:52.001 --> 01:33:53.770
<v Speaker 3>independent of that.</v>

2990
01:33:53.771 --> 01:33:55.420
<v Speaker 3>You might be able to literally,</v>

2991
01:33:55.421 --> 01:33:56.560
<v Speaker 3>you might be able to transfer it.</v>

2992
01:33:57.040 --> 01:33:57.873
<v Speaker 3>I hope so.</v>

2993
01:33:57.880 --> 01:33:59.110
<v Speaker 3>That's going to be so bizarre.</v>

2994
01:33:59.111 --> 01:34:00.160
<v Speaker 3>If that really does happen.</v>

2995
01:34:00.161 --> 01:34:04.210
<v Speaker 3>If they could figure out a way to download your consciousness into a computer,</v>

2996
01:34:04.211 --> 01:34:05.740
<v Speaker 3>if that really becomes we,</v>

2997
01:34:05.741 --> 01:34:07.450
<v Speaker 3>right now it's like it's,</v>

2998
01:34:07.780 --> 01:34:09.340
<v Speaker 3>it's one of those things that they're working on,</v>

2999
01:34:09.341 --> 01:34:10.300
<v Speaker 3>but it seems like a pipe dream,</v>

3000
01:34:10.480 --> 01:34:10.661
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3001
01:34:10.661 --> 01:34:13.140
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't it to you still what to consciousness,</v>

3002
01:34:13.170 --> 01:34:15.310
<v Speaker 3>challenge building consciousness into a computer.</v>

3003
01:34:15.311 --> 01:34:16.210
<v Speaker 3>That seems like a pipe.</v>

3004
01:34:16.211 --> 01:34:17.830
<v Speaker 3>Chase seems like a pipe dream until he,</v>

3005
01:34:17.831 --> 01:34:18.131
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

3006
01:34:18.131 --> 01:34:18.964
<v Speaker 3>so I'm not,</v>

3007
01:34:19.120 --> 01:34:20.140
<v Speaker 3>but I believe it could happen.</v>

3008
01:34:20.141 --> 01:34:20.530
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry.</v>

3009
01:34:20.530 --> 01:34:21.580
<v Speaker 3>I think I blew it to happen.</v>

3010
01:34:22.340 --> 01:34:22.971
<v Speaker 4>I think it could too,</v>

3011
01:34:22.971 --> 01:34:23.290
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

3012
01:34:23.290 --> 01:34:24.200
<v Speaker 4>You are an antenna.</v>

3013
01:34:24.650 --> 01:34:29.210
<v Speaker 4>You're they Iran antenna consisting of all the nanoparticles all the way up to</v>

3014
01:34:29.211 --> 01:34:30.200
<v Speaker 4>what you are right now.</v>

3015
01:34:30.201 --> 01:34:35.000
<v Speaker 4>That combination of everything inside the meat body that you're currently,</v>

3016
01:34:35.330 --> 01:34:39.260
<v Speaker 4>it's called Joe Rogan is in some configuration right now.</v>

3017
01:34:39.261 --> 01:34:43.820
<v Speaker 4>It's in some exact configuration or maybe in the deepest levels.</v>

3018
01:34:43.821 --> 01:34:48.230
<v Speaker 4>It's kind of like harmonic vibrations are weird resonances that are happening in</v>

3019
01:34:48.231 --> 01:34:50.990
<v Speaker 4>the Nano tubules of your dendrites or something.</v>

3020
01:34:51.290 --> 01:34:52.520
<v Speaker 4>But regardless the place,</v>

3021
01:34:52.521 --> 01:34:54.350
<v Speaker 4>what this thing in front of me right now,</v>

3022
01:34:54.620 --> 01:34:59.090
<v Speaker 4>the idea is if I duplicate exactly,</v>

3023
01:34:59.480 --> 01:35:00.313
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3024
01:35:00.440 --> 01:35:01.460
<v Speaker 4>is it going to be you?</v>

3025
01:35:01.550 --> 01:35:04.130
<v Speaker 4>Is it going to be exactly you as you are right now?</v>

3026
01:35:04.340 --> 01:35:05.051
<v Speaker 4>And if it's the,</v>

3027
01:35:05.051 --> 01:35:06.680
<v Speaker 4>if we really are antenna,</v>

3028
01:35:06.830 --> 01:35:07.251
<v Speaker 4>then yeah,</v>

3029
01:35:07.251 --> 01:35:11.270
<v Speaker 4>it's going to tune in the thing that you're tuning in and maybe both of you,</v>

3030
01:35:11.271 --> 01:35:13.100
<v Speaker 4>we'll be tuning in at the same time.</v>

3031
01:35:13.370 --> 01:35:18.370
<v Speaker 4>Maybe they'll be this weird sense of being stretched into two different forms.</v>

3032
01:35:19.161 --> 01:35:24.161
<v Speaker 4>It may be you will actually have to extinguish one form to experience the other</v>

3033
01:35:24.411 --> 01:35:24.531
<v Speaker 4>one.</v>

3034
01:35:24.531 --> 01:35:25.364
<v Speaker 4>Who the fuck knows?</v>

3035
01:35:25.560 --> 01:35:26.730
<v Speaker 3>That would be the ultimate poll,</v>

3036
01:35:26.731 --> 01:35:27.120
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3037
01:35:27.120 --> 01:35:28.980
<v Speaker 3>If they can prove that that form,</v>

3038
01:35:28.981 --> 01:35:32.790
<v Speaker 3>the form of virtual life is more rewarding,</v>

3039
01:35:32.791 --> 01:35:33.511
<v Speaker 3>more powerful,</v>

3040
01:35:33.511 --> 01:35:34.410
<v Speaker 3>more beautiful.</v>

3041
01:35:34.620 --> 01:35:34.831
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3042
01:35:34.831 --> 01:35:36.660
<v Speaker 3>if you went into a virtual life,</v>

3043
01:35:36.690 --> 01:35:40.230
<v Speaker 3>if you plugged into the matrix and you were in the Avatar and you were in love</v>

3044
01:35:40.231 --> 01:35:43.560
<v Speaker 3>with that blue chick and you're just flying around on dragons together,</v>

3045
01:35:44.010 --> 01:35:44.761
<v Speaker 3>we might do it.</v>

3046
01:35:44.761 --> 01:35:45.240
<v Speaker 3>Dude,</v>

3047
01:35:45.240 --> 01:35:46.050
<v Speaker 3>you might do it.</v>

3048
01:35:46.050 --> 01:35:46.291
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3049
01:35:46.291 --> 01:35:47.700
<v Speaker 3>it might feel amazing.</v>

3050
01:35:48.180 --> 01:35:49.860
<v Speaker 3>It might feel just wonderful,</v>

3051
01:35:50.150 --> 01:35:50.630
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3052
01:35:50.630 --> 01:35:50.871
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3053
01:35:50.871 --> 01:35:51.141
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

3054
01:35:51.141 --> 01:35:51.740
<v Speaker 4>so if like,</v>

3055
01:35:51.740 --> 01:35:52.220
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

3056
01:35:52.220 --> 01:35:52.970
<v Speaker 4>let's imagine,</v>

3057
01:35:52.970 --> 01:35:54.560
<v Speaker 4>let's imagine that we could do this,</v>

3058
01:35:54.730 --> 01:35:59.730
<v Speaker 4>which is just because we've gotten to the point in history where through some</v>

3059
01:35:59.871 --> 01:36:01.310
<v Speaker 4>form of analysis,</v>

3060
01:36:01.311 --> 01:36:05.880
<v Speaker 4>we can scan the human body and tune consciousness in,</v>

3061
01:36:06.100 --> 01:36:07.670
<v Speaker 4>in virtual land.</v>

3062
01:36:07.671 --> 01:36:08.390
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

3063
01:36:08.390 --> 01:36:09.980
<v Speaker 4>But you're still out here.</v>

3064
01:36:10.070 --> 01:36:11.090
<v Speaker 4>It's just temporarily,</v>

3065
01:36:11.091 --> 01:36:14.630
<v Speaker 4>your consciousness has been transferred into avatar world or you're flying</v>

3066
01:36:14.631 --> 01:36:15.464
<v Speaker 4>dragons,</v>

3067
01:36:15.840 --> 01:36:16.110
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3068
01:36:16.110 --> 01:36:20.030
<v Speaker 4>making love to these Amazonian blue skin women.</v>

3069
01:36:20.390 --> 01:36:25.390
<v Speaker 4>Imagine like an hour and a half of living in this planet when you knew you had</v>

3070
01:36:25.611 --> 01:36:27.380
<v Speaker 4>to come back and you're like,</v>

3071
01:36:27.381 --> 01:36:28.214
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3072
01:36:29.270 --> 01:36:30.770
<v Speaker 4>I don't think I'm going to come back.</v>

3073
01:36:30.860 --> 01:36:32.300
<v Speaker 4>I think I'm just going to stay.</v>

3074
01:36:32.580 --> 01:36:33.540
<v Speaker 3>How do you pay for it?</v>

3075
01:36:33.541 --> 01:36:36.270
<v Speaker 3>So you'll just have to get a job while you're in the cloud.</v>

3076
01:36:36.271 --> 01:36:36.950
<v Speaker 3>Now Do,</v>

3077
01:36:36.950 --> 01:36:37.741
<v Speaker 3>you don't have to get a job.</v>

3078
01:36:37.741 --> 01:36:39.180
<v Speaker 3>You've been assimilated in the cloud.</v>

3079
01:36:39.360 --> 01:36:41.760
<v Speaker 3>You for your credit card comes up in the cloud and they're like,</v>

3080
01:36:41.780 --> 01:36:42.230
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible],</v>

3081
01:36:42.230 --> 01:36:43.500
<v Speaker 3>we need needed to go on missions.</v>

3082
01:36:43.530 --> 01:36:44.363
<v Speaker 3>And you know what?</v>

3083
01:36:44.610 --> 01:36:44.851
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3084
01:36:44.851 --> 01:36:47.130
<v Speaker 3>And I realize you have to earn your keep.</v>

3085
01:36:47.160 --> 01:36:48.360
<v Speaker 3>Even in the virtual world,</v>

3086
01:36:48.361 --> 01:36:49.950
<v Speaker 3>they don't tell you that until you sign up.</v>

3087
01:36:50.280 --> 01:36:51.930
<v Speaker 3>Nobody would sign up if we told them that.</v>

3088
01:36:51.931 --> 01:36:56.190
<v Speaker 3>But you have to be our virtual slave to pay for your virtual account so you can</v>

3089
01:36:56.191 --> 01:37:00.090
<v Speaker 3>keep riding virtual dragons here I want to show you something really funny and</v>

3090
01:37:00.091 --> 01:37:04.320
<v Speaker 3>then it goes to either web cam or the computer your body sitting in front of and</v>

3091
01:37:04.321 --> 01:37:08.310
<v Speaker 3>it's just some guys like mouth fucking year paralyzed meat body.</v>

3092
01:37:08.520 --> 01:37:09.000
<v Speaker 3>That's a,</v>

3093
01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:09.811
<v Speaker 3>that's the thing too.</v>

3094
01:37:09.811 --> 01:37:10.650
<v Speaker 3>What happens to that?</v>

3095
01:37:10.651 --> 01:37:11.630
<v Speaker 3>To our bodies if we,</v>

3096
01:37:11.631 --> 01:37:14.000
<v Speaker 3>if our consciousness gets transferred a very good point.</v>

3097
01:37:14.040 --> 01:37:16.710
<v Speaker 3>Are they going to do with all these bodies and what if you want to go back,</v>

3098
01:37:16.740 --> 01:37:18.420
<v Speaker 3>can you go back and if you go back,</v>

3099
01:37:18.421 --> 01:37:19.170
<v Speaker 3>what have you,</v>

3100
01:37:19.170 --> 01:37:20.550
<v Speaker 3>what have you go back and you're like,</v>

3101
01:37:20.660 --> 01:37:21.090
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3102
01:37:21.090 --> 01:37:22.800
<v Speaker 3>like a person with brain damage.</v>

3103
01:37:23.050 --> 01:37:25.230
<v Speaker 3>Like what if you go back and you don't get it?</v>

3104
01:37:25.430 --> 01:37:25.890
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>

3105
01:37:25.890 --> 01:37:26.790
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't work anymore.</v>

3106
01:37:26.850 --> 01:37:27.380
<v Speaker 3>It's all fact,</v>

3107
01:37:27.380 --> 01:37:27.750
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3108
01:37:27.750 --> 01:37:28.500
<v Speaker 3>It's not quite right.</v>

3109
01:37:28.500 --> 01:37:33.150
<v Speaker 3>Or what happens when you're out of it in some other fucking thing pops in and</v>

3110
01:37:33.151 --> 01:37:34.130
<v Speaker 3>pretends to be you.</v>

3111
01:37:34.560 --> 01:37:35.760
<v Speaker 4>Like what about that?</v>

3112
01:37:35.761 --> 01:37:39.690
<v Speaker 4>If we're tuning in stuff because really what we're talking about here is if you</v>

3113
01:37:39.691 --> 01:37:42.220
<v Speaker 4>do believe we've gone real far match</v>

3114
01:37:42.250 --> 01:37:42.480
<v Speaker 3>though.</v>

3115
01:37:42.480 --> 01:37:45.340
<v Speaker 3>If we did transfer you back and forth and you,</v>

3116
01:37:45.341 --> 01:37:49.390
<v Speaker 3>you went there and you were just a meat box for a while and then you came back</v>

3117
01:37:49.391 --> 01:37:51.940
<v Speaker 3>like six months later but you'll like brain damaged.</v>

3118
01:37:52.120 --> 01:37:53.950
<v Speaker 3>But you had fantastic stories.</v>

3119
01:37:53.951 --> 01:37:54.610
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3120
01:37:54.610 --> 01:37:55.111
<v Speaker 3>he was just like,</v>

3121
01:37:55.111 --> 01:37:56.100
<v Speaker 3>they lend me back but</v>

3122
01:37:56.370 --> 01:37:58.800
<v Speaker 1>you can't believe what's on the other side.</v>

3123
01:37:59.550 --> 01:38:01.310

01:43:03.280 --> 01:43:03.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3297
01:43:03.750 --> 01:43:05.050
<v Speaker 1>you're going to put it back back.</v>

3298
01:43:05.560 --> 01:43:06.221
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

3299
01:43:06.221 --> 01:43:07.054
<v Speaker 1>But that is,</v>

3300
01:43:07.590 --> 01:43:08.423
<v Speaker 1>that is it.</v>

3301
01:43:09.970 --> 01:43:11.200
<v Speaker 1>That's what you're looking at,</v>

3302
01:43:11.201 --> 01:43:11.990
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3303
01:43:11.990 --> 01:43:13.120
<v Speaker 1>You're that crazy.</v>

3304
01:43:13.170 --> 01:43:13.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3305
01:43:13.510 --> 01:43:14.200
<v Speaker 1>Well I mean,</v>

3306
01:43:14.200 --> 01:43:15.040
<v Speaker 1>yeah man.</v>

3307
01:43:15.160 --> 01:43:15.993
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is,</v>

3308
01:43:16.030 --> 01:43:18.280
<v Speaker 1>I'm terrified because porn is already,</v>

3309
01:43:19.410 --> 01:43:19.800
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3310
01:43:19.800 --> 01:43:20.080
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

3311
01:43:20.080 --> 01:43:23.170
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure that from time to time you occasionally will look upon porn,</v>

3312
01:43:24.080 --> 01:43:24.541
<v Speaker 1>having them.</v>

3313
01:43:24.541 --> 01:43:25.990
<v Speaker 1>Imagine you do from time to time.</v>

3314
01:43:26.140 --> 01:43:29.770
<v Speaker 1>And it's already incredibly engrossing just in today's space.</v>

3315
01:43:29.890 --> 01:43:32.320
<v Speaker 1>So when suddenly you find yourself,</v>

3316
01:43:32.660 --> 01:43:33.070
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3317
01:43:33.070 --> 01:43:33.903
<v Speaker 1>in a,</v>

3318
01:43:33.940 --> 01:43:34.930
<v Speaker 1>in a room,</v>

3319
01:43:35.220 --> 01:43:35.720
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3320
01:43:35.720 --> 01:43:40.570
<v Speaker 1>that's not your room with a girl that you've never seen in your life,</v>

3321
01:43:40.990 --> 01:43:45.990
<v Speaker 1>writing you and looking at you like she really loves you and then you look down</v>

3322
01:43:46.481 --> 01:43:49.540
<v Speaker 1>and it's not your body anymore and that's not your cock.</v>

3323
01:43:49.750 --> 01:43:52.110
<v Speaker 1>And he looked back up at</v>

3324
01:43:52.130 --> 01:43:53.120
<v Speaker 4>this beautiful girl.</v>

3325
01:43:53.121 --> 01:43:54.170
<v Speaker 4>He seems to really like,</v>

3326
01:43:54.171 --> 01:43:55.430
<v Speaker 4>she's known you for a long time.</v>

3327
01:43:55.431 --> 01:43:57.950
<v Speaker 4>It seems like you're in a really good part of your relationship.</v>

3328
01:43:58.370 --> 01:43:59.091
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

3329
01:43:59.091 --> 01:43:59.540
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

3330
01:43:59.540 --> 01:44:00.170
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3331
01:44:00.170 --> 01:44:01.370
<v Speaker 4>that's the one that I saw,</v>

3332
01:44:01.550 --> 01:44:02.383
<v Speaker 4>but it's like,</v>

3333
01:44:02.540 --> 01:44:03.373
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3334
01:44:03.890 --> 01:44:05.150
<v Speaker 4>for a lot of people,</v>

3335
01:44:05.780 --> 01:44:06.190
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3336
01:44:06.190 --> 01:44:08.540
<v Speaker 4>I think that's going to be real hard to come back from.</v>

3337
01:44:08.570 --> 01:44:12.860
<v Speaker 4>It's going to be real hard to peel those goggles off and uh,</v>

3338
01:44:12.861 --> 01:44:17.330
<v Speaker 4>walk into your living room where your wife is passed out on the,</v>

3339
01:44:17.840 --> 01:44:18.770
<v Speaker 4>on the Sofa,</v>

3340
01:44:18.790 --> 01:44:23.480
<v Speaker 4>and maybe your blanket falls down and all the farts that have been held in there</v>

3341
01:44:23.481 --> 01:44:27.380
<v Speaker 4>from the Campbell's chunky soup did she ate earlier,</v>

3342
01:44:27.710 --> 01:44:29.990
<v Speaker 4>come wafting up into your face.</v>

3343
01:44:30.320 --> 01:44:31.130
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

3344
01:44:31.130 --> 01:44:31.963
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3345
01:44:32.270 --> 01:44:34.220
<v Speaker 4>and you look down at your body and it's,</v>

3346
01:44:34.221 --> 01:44:34.521
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3347
01:44:34.521 --> 01:44:35.840
<v Speaker 4>it's just a normal body.</v>

3348
01:44:35.841 --> 01:44:40.610
<v Speaker 4>It's not the ripped tattooed dude who is fucking whoever that girl was.</v>

3349
01:44:40.611 --> 01:44:45.611
<v Speaker 4>And you're going to like have this strange kind of a virtual jet lag where you</v>

3350
01:44:46.671 --> 01:44:51.290
<v Speaker 4>have to accept that the paradigm that you're existing in is not a perfect</v>

3351
01:44:51.291 --> 01:44:53.950
<v Speaker 4>paradigm that's going to be hard for a lot of people to,</v>

3352
01:44:53.970 --> 01:44:54.200
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3353
01:44:54.200 --> 01:44:54.861
<v Speaker 4>to deal with.</v>

3354
01:44:54.861 --> 01:44:56.180
<v Speaker 4>I think that's going to be a real,</v>

3355
01:44:56.660 --> 01:44:58.220
<v Speaker 4>a real problem.</v>

3356
01:44:58.250 --> 01:44:59.520
<v Speaker 4>That's a real problem,</v>

3357
01:44:59.521 --> 01:44:59.900
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

3358
01:44:59.900 --> 01:45:00.500
<v Speaker 4>I think it's,</v>

3359
01:45:00.500 --> 01:45:01.101
<v Speaker 4>I think you're right.</v>

3360
01:45:01.101 --> 01:45:01.410
<v Speaker 4>And I think,</v>

3361
01:45:01.410 --> 01:45:01.510
<v Speaker 4>I think</v>

3362
01:45:01.510 --> 01:45:05.530
<v Speaker 5>the visual aspect of it and just having the robot thing on your Dick thought so</v>

3363
01:45:05.531 --> 01:45:06.071
<v Speaker 5>crude,</v>

3364
01:45:06.071 --> 01:45:07.390
<v Speaker 5>that's like one step.</v>

3365
01:45:07.720 --> 01:45:12.010
<v Speaker 5>They're going to figure out a way to tap those ideas directly into your brand.</v>

3366
01:45:12.190 --> 01:45:13.750
<v Speaker 5>You're going to be able to experience it.</v>

3367
01:45:13.930 --> 01:45:14.920
<v Speaker 5>You're gonna be able to experience it.</v>

3368
01:45:14.921 --> 01:45:16.510
<v Speaker 5>I think it's probably going to come in the form.</v>

3369
01:45:16.870 --> 01:45:18.880
<v Speaker 5>Obviously I have no idea what the fuck I'm talking about.</v>

3370
01:45:19.270 --> 01:45:20.890
<v Speaker 5>But if I had to guess,</v>

3371
01:45:20.891 --> 01:45:24.760
<v Speaker 5>like if I had just random speculation on the future,</v>

3372
01:45:25.210 --> 01:45:30.210
<v Speaker 5>I think we're gonna find a way to record memories on a device in HD there.</v>

3373
01:45:31.190 --> 01:45:36.190
<v Speaker 5>They're going to find a way to either do something with the eyes or figure out a</v>

3374
01:45:37.631 --> 01:45:42.631
<v Speaker 5>way through something you wear to tune in to the reality that you're</v>

3375
01:45:43.151 --> 01:45:44.920
<v Speaker 5>experiencing from head to toe tuna,</v>

3376
01:45:44.950 --> 01:45:45.180
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3377
01:45:45.180 --> 01:45:46.540
<v Speaker 5>Tuna didn't sit through a frequency,</v>

3378
01:45:46.650 --> 01:45:50.050
<v Speaker 5>record it on some sort of a hard drive,</v>

3379
01:45:50.051 --> 01:45:52.000
<v Speaker 5>a little tiny flash thing,</v>

3380
01:45:52.150 --> 01:45:54.460
<v Speaker 5>and we'll have a little flash thing in the back of our head.</v>

3381
01:45:54.460 --> 01:45:55.061
<v Speaker 5>Or who knows,</v>

3382
01:45:55.061 --> 01:45:55.331
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

3383
01:45:55.331 --> 01:45:58.220
<v Speaker 5>maybe we'll even all just be in the cloud all around you all the time.</v>

3384
01:45:58.410 --> 01:45:59.260
<v Speaker 5>That's more likely,</v>

3385
01:45:59.560 --> 01:46:00.221
<v Speaker 5>very likely,</v>

3386
01:46:00.221 --> 01:46:03.760
<v Speaker 5>and you will be able to dip into the Bank of other people's experiences.</v>

3387
01:46:03.780 --> 01:46:08.440
<v Speaker 5>You will have the antenna that'll shoot right into our memory or write into our</v>

3388
01:46:08.441 --> 01:46:12.550
<v Speaker 5>mind or right into our experience center and boom,</v>

3389
01:46:12.610 --> 01:46:14.020
<v Speaker 5>I'm live in Duncan trussell's life.</v>

3390
01:46:14.021 --> 01:46:17.250
<v Speaker 5>I'm snowboarding as Duncan Trussell and when it right,</v>

3391
01:46:17.251 --> 01:46:18.130
<v Speaker 5>and I start with it,</v>

3392
01:46:18.340 --> 01:46:19.300
<v Speaker 5>Jimmy Hendrix,</v>

3393
01:46:19.330 --> 01:46:20.800
<v Speaker 5>manic depression is playing.</v>

3394
01:46:21.410 --> 01:46:21.630
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3395
01:46:21.630 --> 01:46:21.940
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

3396
01:46:21.940 --> 01:46:26.940
<v Speaker 5>Don't you wake up snowboarding in your body listening to Jimi Hendrix and I'm</v>

3397
01:46:27.401 --> 01:46:31.750
<v Speaker 5>living your life for the next hour or two hours that you recorded this and put</v>

3398
01:46:31.751 --> 01:46:32.770
<v Speaker 5>it up on Youtube.</v>

3399
01:46:32.830 --> 01:46:34.150
<v Speaker 5>That's what you two becomes.</v>

3400
01:46:34.600 --> 01:46:35.201
<v Speaker 5>Two becomes.</v>

3401
01:46:35.201 --> 01:46:36.910
<v Speaker 5>Everybody gets to live cranes.</v>

3402
01:46:37.040 --> 01:46:37.750
<v Speaker 5>You are living,</v>

3403
01:46:37.750 --> 01:46:38.920
<v Speaker 5>it goes total.</v>

3404
01:46:38.921 --> 01:46:39.754
<v Speaker 5>Next level.</v>

3405
01:46:39.760 --> 01:46:42.490
<v Speaker 5>It makes youtube today look like cave drawings.</v>

3406
01:46:42.491 --> 01:46:43.210
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3407
01:46:43.210 --> 01:46:44.650
<v Speaker 5>figure out a way to tap deep,</v>

3408
01:46:45.280 --> 01:46:47.770
<v Speaker 5>deep into the actual memory itself.</v>

3409
01:46:47.800 --> 01:46:50.250
<v Speaker 5>Even missing dog.</v>

3410
01:46:50.490 --> 01:46:52.590
<v Speaker 1>Even like thinking when I get home,</v>

3411
01:46:52.591 --> 01:46:54.600
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to definitely throw out that toilet.</v>

3412
01:46:55.060 --> 01:46:55.891
<v Speaker 1>You know all that stuff.</v>

3413
01:46:55.891 --> 01:46:56.910
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be in your head.</v>

3414
01:46:56.911 --> 01:46:58.770
<v Speaker 1>You're going to be all of it recorded,</v>

3415
01:46:58.890 --> 01:46:59.520
<v Speaker 1>all of it.</v>

3416
01:46:59.520 --> 01:47:03.990
<v Speaker 1>We're going to be in an ocean of memories digitally recorded in the cloud and</v>

3417
01:47:03.991 --> 01:47:04.950
<v Speaker 1>also don't forget,</v>

3418
01:47:05.370 --> 01:47:06.270
<v Speaker 1>possibly,</v>

3419
01:47:06.540 --> 01:47:10.350
<v Speaker 1>maybe suddenly graveyards are preserved.</v>

3420
01:47:10.351 --> 01:47:13.350
<v Speaker 1>Brains become reservoirs of old memories,</v>

3421
01:47:13.351 --> 01:47:16.770
<v Speaker 1>so you might even be able to harvest the memories of the dead.</v>

3422
01:47:17.040 --> 01:47:17.850
<v Speaker 1>You know you might.</v>

3423
01:47:17.850 --> 01:47:19.410
<v Speaker 1>Who knows if epigenetics,</v>

3424
01:47:19.480 --> 01:47:19.710
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

3425
01:47:19.710 --> 01:47:22.290
<v Speaker 1>if these memories are being stored are encoded.</v>

3426
01:47:22.930 --> 01:47:27.810
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you could go into the DNA of a mummy and have Einstein's brain.</v>

3427
01:47:28.590 --> 01:47:30.210
<v Speaker 1>I hope they'll die.</v>

3428
01:47:30.570 --> 01:47:31.230
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

3429
01:47:31.230 --> 01:47:33.300
<v Speaker 1>I feel like these preserved Einstein's brain.</v>

3430
01:47:33.330 --> 01:47:36.000
<v Speaker 1>I think they got us doing experiments on it.</v>

3431
01:47:36.001 --> 01:47:36.301
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>

3432
01:47:36.301 --> 01:47:37.800
<v Speaker 1>Trying to find out why it was so wacky,</v>

3433
01:47:37.801 --> 01:47:38.311
<v Speaker 1>strong,</v>

3434
01:47:38.311 --> 01:47:39.300
<v Speaker 1>super powerful.</v>

3435
01:47:39.330 --> 01:47:40.440
<v Speaker 1>Can you imagine that?</v>

3436
01:47:40.441 --> 01:47:44.310
<v Speaker 1>Imagine the fucking waking Einstein up and of computer and the first thing he's</v>

3437
01:47:44.340 --> 01:47:44.760
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

3438
01:47:44.760 --> 01:47:45.270
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

3439
01:47:45.270 --> 01:47:45.630
<v Speaker 1>Wait,</v>

3440
01:47:45.630 --> 01:47:46.350
<v Speaker 1>where am I?</v>

3441
01:47:46.350 --> 01:47:47.070
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

3442
01:47:47.070 --> 01:47:47.970
<v Speaker 1>What have you done?</v>

3443
01:47:48.450 --> 01:47:49.283
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3444
01:47:49.740 --> 01:47:50.930
<v Speaker 1>you fucking assholes done.</v>

3445
01:47:51.600 --> 01:47:52.590
<v Speaker 1>Who would let you do this?</v>

3446
01:47:52.650 --> 01:47:53.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3447
01:47:53.340 --> 01:47:53.521
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

3448
01:47:53.521 --> 01:47:54.354
<v Speaker 1>shut me off.</v>

3449
01:47:54.620 --> 01:47:57.360
<v Speaker 1>He's having a great time and he's up in heaven.</v>

3450
01:47:58.470 --> 01:47:58.651
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3451
01:47:58.651 --> 01:47:59.570
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to shut you off.</v>

3452
01:47:59.600 --> 01:48:02.520
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to drop you into world of Warcraft.</v>

3453
01:48:03.780 --> 01:48:07.040
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

3454
01:48:07.041 --> 01:48:07.711
<v Speaker 1>What are you going to do,</v>

3455
01:48:07.711 --> 01:48:08.421
<v Speaker 1>Einstein?</v>

3456
01:48:08.421 --> 01:48:11.360
<v Speaker 1>You better get some magic clean.</v>

3457
01:48:13.880 --> 01:48:14.970
<v Speaker 1>You gotta level up.</v>

3458
01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:16.490
<v Speaker 1>That's going to be weird to think that we are.</v>

3459
01:48:16.491 --> 01:48:21.491
<v Speaker 1>We're going to be able to re to resurrect anyone whose DNA still exists and drop</v>

3460
01:48:22.441 --> 01:48:25.050
<v Speaker 1>them into video games and tortures and just for fun.</v>

3461
01:48:25.920 --> 01:48:28.980
<v Speaker 1>Well that when you were talking about porn being a real problem,</v>

3462
01:48:29.220 --> 01:48:31.950
<v Speaker 1>the other thing that's going to be a real problem is that video games,</v>

3463
01:48:32.310 --> 01:48:34.290
<v Speaker 1>video games are going to be a crazy problem.</v>

3464
01:48:34.360 --> 01:48:35.101
<v Speaker 1>This is awesome.</v>

3465
01:48:35.101 --> 01:48:35.934
<v Speaker 1>As they are now.</v>

3466
01:48:36.150 --> 01:48:36.361
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

3467
01:48:36.361 --> 01:48:36.931
<v Speaker 1>I get jealous.</v>

3468
01:48:36.931 --> 01:48:41.190
<v Speaker 1>I was watching this thing on kim.com kim.com was apparently like the number one</v>

3469
01:48:41.191 --> 01:48:43.440
<v Speaker 1>call of duty player in the world at one point.</v>

3470
01:48:43.441 --> 01:48:43.981
<v Speaker 1>You know who he is,</v>

3471
01:48:43.981 --> 01:48:44.760
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3472
01:48:44.760 --> 01:48:47.400
<v Speaker 1>He's the Guy who runs a mega upload.</v>

3473
01:48:47.401 --> 01:48:47.880
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

3474
01:48:47.880 --> 01:48:49.710
<v Speaker 1>And they took all of his money.</v>

3475
01:48:49.711 --> 01:48:52.800
<v Speaker 1>It's like this crazy thing with America.</v>

3476
01:48:52.801 --> 01:48:56.370
<v Speaker 1>They're saying he's fleeing justice because he won't come to America,</v>

3477
01:48:56.371 --> 01:48:58.350
<v Speaker 1>stays in New Zealand and reports are,</v>

3478
01:48:58.351 --> 01:48:59.880
<v Speaker 1>he's the coolest guy ever.</v>

3479
01:48:59.940 --> 01:49:00.900
<v Speaker 1>He seems very,</v>

3480
01:49:00.901 --> 01:49:01.291
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

3481
01:49:01.291 --> 01:49:01.651
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

<v Speaker 1>very cool.</v>

3484
01:49:02.970 --> 01:49:03.810
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

3485
01:49:04.080 --> 01:49:05.160
<v Speaker 1>for whatever reason.</v>

3486
01:49:05.370 --> 01:49:05.790
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

3487
01:49:05.790 --> 01:49:06.601
<v Speaker 1>the point is they should,</v>

3488
01:49:06.601 --> 01:49:08.400
<v Speaker 1>they had this tour of his house and uh,</v>

3489
01:49:08.401 --> 01:49:08.591
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3490
01:49:08.591 --> 01:49:10.170
<v Speaker 1>it was kind of going over the details of his case,</v>

3491
01:49:10.171 --> 01:49:13.200
<v Speaker 1>but I was watching like his video game room's got to like a room where he plays</v>

3492
01:49:13.201 --> 01:49:14.010
<v Speaker 1>this fucking game.</v>

3493
01:49:14.010 --> 01:49:17.010
<v Speaker 1>I can't even watch it for a few minutes and watch her for a few minutes ago.</v>

3494
01:49:17.070 --> 01:49:17.341
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

3495
01:49:17.341 --> 01:49:18.270
<v Speaker 1>that must be fucking awesome.</v>

3496
01:49:18.620 --> 01:49:19.800
<v Speaker 1>That must be so awesome to play.</v>

3497
01:49:19.801 --> 01:49:20.011
<v Speaker 1>Come.</v>

3498
01:49:20.011 --> 01:49:21.380
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I'll just get into it from,</v>

3499
01:49:21.390 --> 01:49:21.780
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3500
01:49:21.780 --> 01:49:22.110
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3501
01:49:22.110 --> 01:49:22.943
<v Speaker 1>I can't fucking do it.</v>

3502
01:49:23.100 --> 01:49:24.570
<v Speaker 1>But this is going to be nothing.</v>

3503
01:49:24.720 --> 01:49:25.700
<v Speaker 1>This is almost like a pitstop.</v>

3504
01:49:25.800 --> 01:49:26.760
<v Speaker 1>You don't even have to take like,</v>

3505
01:49:26.761 --> 01:49:27.260
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

3506
01:49:27.260 --> 01:49:28.093
<v Speaker 1>hold you.</v>

3507
01:49:28.140 --> 01:49:29.010
<v Speaker 1>Are you this hungry?</v>

3508
01:49:29.011 --> 01:49:32.610
<v Speaker 1>Cause in the half an hour there's a Kentucky Fried Chicken and they got that new</v>

3509
01:49:32.611 --> 01:49:33.361
<v Speaker 1>double double.</v>

3510
01:49:33.361 --> 01:49:34.194
<v Speaker 1>If you had that,</v>

3511
01:49:35.100 --> 01:49:35.671
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3512
01:49:35.671 --> 01:49:38.790
<v Speaker 1>it's like you pass like Mike Shit Burgers,</v>

3513
01:49:38.820 --> 01:49:41.130
<v Speaker 1>you know and you know like it just hang on for another half hour.</v>

3514
01:49:41.340 --> 01:49:42.180
<v Speaker 1>That's what it feel like.</v>

3515
01:49:42.450 --> 01:49:44.760
<v Speaker 1>It's like what they're coming out with with these goggles.</v>

3516
01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:45.301
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3517

3520
01:49:48.880 --> 01:49:50.820
<v Speaker 1>He asked me if I had been in doctor dated.</v>

3521
01:49:51.460 --> 01:49:51.611

3524
01:49:54.131 --> 01:49:55.390
<v Speaker 1>Carmax tweeting you.</v>

3525

<v Speaker 3>Is this a,</v>

3562
01:50:39.331 --> 01:50:40.450
<v Speaker 3>the new magic leap thing?</v>

3563
01:50:40.690 --> 01:50:43.560
<v Speaker 3>That video they put out last week of this is supposedly what it's going to look</v>

3564
01:50:43.561 --> 01:50:44.190
<v Speaker 3>like.</v>

3565

<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3566
01:50:44.461 --> 01:50:46.110
<v Speaker 3>Let's see what magic leap looks like here.</v>

3567
01:50:46.200 --> 01:50:48.090
<v Speaker 3>Can the folks at home see some version of this?</v>

3568
01:50:48.091 --> 01:50:48.300
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3569
01:50:48.300 --> 01:50:48.660
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3570
01:50:48.660 --> 01:50:50.790
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to go pee all the time and make that happen.</v>

3571
01:50:50.791 --> 01:50:53.190
<v Speaker 3>Tonkin decays healthy,</v>

3572
01:50:53.191 --> 01:50:53.491

01:50:53.491 --> 01:50:54.330
<v Speaker 3>healthy fit,</v>

3574
01:50:54.331 --> 01:50:55.164
<v Speaker 3>Dunkin,</v>

3575
01:50:56.040 --> 01:50:56.970
<v Speaker 3>keeping it together.</v>

3576
01:50:56.971 --> 01:50:57.804
<v Speaker 3>Dunkin.</v>

3577
01:50:57.930 --> 01:50:58.741
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

3578
01:50:58.741 --> 01:50:59.910
<v Speaker 3>So this magic leap,</v>

3579
01:50:59.911 --> 01:51:03.690
<v Speaker 3>it lets holograms appealing appear in front of you and the,</v>

3580
01:51:03.691 --> 01:51:04.471
<v Speaker 3>they're spinning.</v>

3581
01:51:04.471 --> 01:51:07.710
<v Speaker 3>This person in this video is spinning these holograms,</v>

3582
01:51:08.150 --> 01:51:11.960
<v Speaker 5>moving them around and stretching them and touching them as if they're the</v>

3583
01:51:11.961 --> 01:51:12.794
<v Speaker 5>interface.</v>

3584
01:51:12.830 --> 01:51:14.690
<v Speaker 5>On a computer just loaded up the game.</v>

3585
01:51:14.920 --> 01:51:16.280
<v Speaker 5>You got to play a video game right now.</v>

3586
01:51:16.610 --> 01:51:19.310
<v Speaker 5>So he's about to play a video game right now in his head.</v>

3587
01:51:19.640 --> 01:51:20.960
<v Speaker 5>This is fucking insane.</v>

3588
01:51:22.270 --> 01:51:23.480
<v Speaker 5>And he grabs a gun?</v>

3589
01:51:23.540 --> 01:51:23.900
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3590
01:51:23.900 --> 01:51:24.770
<v Speaker 5>Where's he get that gun?</v>

3591
01:51:24.771 --> 01:51:25.670
<v Speaker 5>That's plastic gun,</v>

3592
01:51:25.790 --> 01:51:26.121
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3593
01:51:26.121 --> 01:51:27.830
<v Speaker 5>Or it's a visual virtual.</v>

3594
01:51:28.190 --> 01:51:30.170
<v Speaker 5>We can't be virtual because he's holding in his hand.</v>

3595
01:51:30.200 --> 01:51:31.150
<v Speaker 5>I think it's virtual.</v>

3596
01:51:31.190 --> 01:51:32.150
<v Speaker 5>No chance.</v>

3597
01:51:32.390 --> 01:51:33.260
<v Speaker 5>What they're trying to say.</v>

3598
01:51:33.950 --> 01:51:35.030
<v Speaker 5>That's what they're trying to say.</v>

3599
01:51:35.120 --> 01:51:35.690
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3600
01:51:35.690 --> 01:51:36.410
<v Speaker 5>I think I'd be,</v>

3601
01:51:36.410 --> 01:51:37.520
<v Speaker 5>I'd rather have a real gun.</v>

3602
01:51:37.720 --> 01:51:38.553
<v Speaker 5>Cause a real gun.</v>

3603
01:51:39.170 --> 01:51:39.921
<v Speaker 5>But this is pretty dope.</v>

3604
01:51:39.921 --> 01:51:42.410
<v Speaker 5>So he's playing video games at his house?</v>

3605
01:51:42.530 --> 01:51:43.100
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3607
01:51:44.990 --> 01:51:46.790
<v Speaker 5>this might be the end of the world.</v>

3608
01:51:48.320 --> 01:51:48.561

<v Speaker 4>I mean that was a really interesting dilemma that guy was facing.</v>

3656
01:52:55.190 --> 01:52:56.023
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3659
01:53:00.951 --> 01:53:01.784
<v Speaker 4>we just talked about.</v>

3660
01:53:02.410 --> 01:53:05.780
<v Speaker 4>There's a bunch of people that are aware that we're in some weird space.</v>

3661
01:53:05.840 --> 01:53:09.590
<v Speaker 4>We just showed the games that you play on magic leap and I see that we just</v>

3662
01:53:09.591 --> 01:53:11.090
<v Speaker 4>shoot the people in your living room.</v>

3663
01:53:11.091 --> 01:53:12.290
<v Speaker 4>You get robots coming after you.</v>

01:53:15.170 --> 01:53:15.951
<v Speaker 4>that's right man.</v>

3669
01:53:15.951 --> 01:53:16.161
<v Speaker 4>That,</v>

3670
01:53:16.161 --> 01:53:17.510
<v Speaker 4>that stuff is really cool.</v>

3671
01:53:17.540 --> 01:53:17.901
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>

3672
01:53:17.901 --> 01:53:20.000
<v Speaker 4>that's the data visualization,</v>

3673
01:53:20.001 --> 01:53:20.240
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3674
01:53:20.240 --> 01:53:23.600
<v Speaker 4>that's the idea that we're sort of surrounded by this midst of data and that</v>

3675
01:53:23.601 --> 01:53:26.750
<v Speaker 4>technology is going to visualize it and all these new ways.</v>

3676
01:53:26.750 --> 01:53:30.770
<v Speaker 4>Like currently the way it's visualized is in two d on the screen in our pockets.</v>

3677
01:53:31.280 --> 01:53:32.510
<v Speaker 4>But the idea of like,</v>

3678
01:53:32.690 --> 01:53:32.991
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3679
01:53:32.991 --> 01:53:37.991
<v Speaker 4>just cool shit like as you're driving your tweets or any tweets at you come</v>

3680
01:53:38.451 --> 01:53:41.570
<v Speaker 4>flying into your car or you know,</v>

3681
01:53:41.600 --> 01:53:45.470
<v Speaker 4>tweets will become three d things floating around people or my friend,</v>

3682
01:53:45.830 --> 01:53:48.170
<v Speaker 4>my friend Pemberton says uh,</v>

3683
01:53:48.171 --> 01:53:50.960
<v Speaker 4>it's all gonna be Johnny Palmer and funny guy but he's,</v>

3684
01:53:50.970 --> 01:53:51.130
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>

3685
01:53:51.130 --> 01:53:54.770
<v Speaker 4>he says that it's going to be like credit is going to become the new form of a</v>

3686
01:53:54.790 --> 01:53:57.410
<v Speaker 4>leadism and that you're in your augmented reality land,</v>

3687
01:53:57.411 --> 01:53:59.470
<v Speaker 4>your credit score can float around you.</v>

3688
01:53:59.520 --> 01:54:01.550
<v Speaker 4>So people get,</v>

3689
01:54:01.700 --> 01:54:01.970
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3690
01:54:01.970 --> 01:54:02.803
<v Speaker 4>that kind of shit.</v>

3691
01:54:02.930 --> 01:54:07.400
<v Speaker 4>Like it's going to be weird cause the way that the people build themselves up is</v>

3692
01:54:07.570 --> 01:54:10.040
<v Speaker 4>in augmented reality is going to be hilarious.</v>

3693
01:54:10.041 --> 01:54:11.330
<v Speaker 4>Like the trophies,</v>

3694
01:54:11.331 --> 01:54:14.270
<v Speaker 4>you were like little augmented reality metals that you'll wear.</v>

3695
01:54:14.270 --> 01:54:15.740
<v Speaker 4>Cause you know like you know,</v>

3696
01:54:15.741 --> 01:54:17.480
<v Speaker 4>it's a big deal for people.</v>

3697
01:54:18.110 --> 01:54:19.490
<v Speaker 4>My Twitter followers,</v>

3698
01:54:19.670 --> 01:54:20.211
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean?</v>

3699
01:54:20.211 --> 01:54:21.080
<v Speaker 4>People were really into that.</v>

3700
01:54:21.081 --> 01:54:25.100
<v Speaker 4>The number of Twitter followers you have is that some kind of indication of your</v>

3701
01:54:25.101 --> 01:54:25.850
<v Speaker 4>fame.</v>

3702
01:54:25.850 --> 01:54:27.380
<v Speaker 4>So that kind of shit,</v>

3703
01:54:27.381 --> 01:54:28.880
<v Speaker 4>people are going to figure out ways to,</v>

3704
01:54:29.180 --> 01:54:31.880
<v Speaker 4>to wear it and augmented reality space.</v>

3705
01:54:31.881 --> 01:54:33.080
<v Speaker 4>And kind of subtle ways,</v>

3706
01:54:33.081 --> 01:54:34.370
<v Speaker 4>but ways that people can see it.</v>

3707
01:54:34.610 --> 01:54:37.250
<v Speaker 4>It used to be if you wanted to brag about your success,</v>

3708
01:54:37.460 --> 01:54:40.580
<v Speaker 4>the way you would visualize it was by wearing gold.</v>

3709
01:54:40.880 --> 01:54:41.631
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

3710
01:54:41.631 --> 01:54:43.170
<v Speaker 4>It's that people still do it right?</v>

3711
01:54:43.310 --> 01:54:44.150
<v Speaker 4>They want to show their,</v>

3712
01:54:44.290 --> 01:54:45.350
<v Speaker 4>they want it subtly.</v>

3713
01:54:45.351 --> 01:54:50.351
<v Speaker 4>Say I'm a rich mother fucker by showing you their Kohl's watcher gold chains.</v>

3714
01:54:50.841 --> 01:54:51.081
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

3715
01:54:51.081 --> 01:54:51.411
<v Speaker 4>see,</v>

3716
01:54:51.411 --> 01:54:54.980
<v Speaker 4>I'm actually wearing a rare metal that's cause I'm doing good.</v>

3717
01:54:55.310 --> 01:54:56.510
<v Speaker 4>Recognize it,</v>

3718
01:54:57.200 --> 01:54:58.880
<v Speaker 4>but the new way of doing that,</v>

3719
01:54:58.881 --> 01:54:59.714
<v Speaker 4>it's going to be,</v>

3720
01:54:59.810 --> 01:55:00.590
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3721
01:55:00.590 --> 01:55:00.980
<v Speaker 4>Shit.</v>

3722
01:55:00.980 --> 01:55:02.510
<v Speaker 4>There really is more relevant,</v>

3723
01:55:02.720 --> 01:55:03.650
<v Speaker 4>which is like,</v>

3724
01:55:04.070 --> 01:55:04.621
<v Speaker 4>you know what?</v>

3725
01:55:04.621 --> 01:55:06.680
<v Speaker 4>What are you going to look like in that virtual world?</v>

3726
01:55:06.980 --> 01:55:07.341
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3727
01:55:07.341 --> 01:55:09.560
<v Speaker 4>if it's predicated on how much money you have,</v>

3728
01:55:10.190 --> 01:55:10.791
<v Speaker 4>like what if you,</v>

3729
01:55:10.791 --> 01:55:14.270
<v Speaker 4>what if you look like that Persian guy from 300 the giant guy.</v>

3730
01:55:14.510 --> 01:55:15.140
<v Speaker 4>What was his name?</v>

3731
01:55:15.140 --> 01:55:15.973
<v Speaker 4>Xerxes.</v>

3732
01:55:15.980 --> 01:55:16.580
<v Speaker 4>Xerxes.</v>

3733
01:55:16.580 --> 01:55:16.880
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3734
01:55:16.880 --> 01:55:18.140
<v Speaker 4>How about that shits on.</v>

3735
01:55:18.230 --> 01:55:20.180
<v Speaker 4>That's when you're super bowl and you're 10 feet tall,</v>

3736
01:55:20.480 --> 01:55:21.700
<v Speaker 4>10 foot tall Persian dude,</v>

3737
01:55:21.701 --> 01:55:22.550
<v Speaker 4>but cool earrings.</v>

3738
01:55:22.610 --> 01:55:25.550
<v Speaker 4>But you can only look like that if you've got a 700 credit score and have a</v>

3739
01:55:25.551 --> 01:55:26.384
<v Speaker 4>Citibank card,</v>

3740
01:55:26.600 --> 01:55:30.680
<v Speaker 4>but you can look like that if you have a 700 credit score and a Citibank card,</v>

3741
01:55:30.681 --> 01:55:31.670
<v Speaker 4>you can look like that.</v>

3742
01:55:31.671 --> 01:55:31.970
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3743
01:55:31.970 --> 01:55:32.960
<v Speaker 4>That's something to aspire to.</v>

3744
01:55:32.961 --> 01:55:35.320
<v Speaker 4>Dunkin feed the machine because it's like,</v>

3745
01:55:35.330 --> 01:55:35.811
<v Speaker 4>think of that.</v>

3746
01:55:35.811 --> 01:55:37.920
<v Speaker 4>What's that stupid car thing that everybody,</v>

3747
01:55:37.940 --> 01:55:42.110
<v Speaker 4>that people get really into the black American Express who's got the black,</v>

3748
01:55:42.260 --> 01:55:46.360
<v Speaker 4>but it's like things that like stupid stupid ways that we try to like this</v>

3751
01:55:53.130 --> 01:55:53.401
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3752
01:55:53.401 --> 01:55:57.210
<v Speaker 4>there's just so many ways that people try to d or The new ad and an apple watch</v>

3753
01:55:57.480 --> 01:55:58.201
<v Speaker 4>and if you want,</v>

3754
01:55:58.201 --> 01:56:03.201
<v Speaker 4>you can get one for $19,000 with a gold chain and then like he can go around and</v>

3755
01:56:04.081 --> 01:56:05.890
<v Speaker 4>show everybody luck.</v>

3756
01:56:05.910 --> 01:56:07.080
<v Speaker 4>I'm allowed Ed.</v>

3757
01:56:07.260 --> 01:56:08.280
<v Speaker 4>If it's 10 grand,</v>

3758
01:56:08.550 --> 01:56:11.610
<v Speaker 4>10 grand for the Super Spencer one Tangere isn't something like that.</v>

3759
01:56:11.880 --> 01:56:12.450
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy.</v>

3760
01:56:12.450 --> 01:56:12.961
<v Speaker 4>But still,</v>

3761
01:56:12.961 --> 01:56:13.900
<v Speaker 4>it's very funny though.</v>

3762
01:56:13.901 --> 01:56:17.760
<v Speaker 4>The way we try to indicate our worth or value is through a rare metal,</v>

3763
01:56:18.060 --> 01:56:18.840
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3764
01:56:18.840 --> 01:56:19.261
<v Speaker 4>when,</v>

3765
01:56:19.261 --> 01:56:23.850
<v Speaker 4>when what it really indicates a person's value these days is not so much like</v>

3766
01:56:24.090 --> 01:56:27.600
<v Speaker 4>can you afford to wear a rare metal?</v>

3767
01:56:27.720 --> 01:56:29.850
<v Speaker 4>It's a lot of other stuff that goes into it.</v>

3768
01:56:29.851 --> 01:56:30.121
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3769
01:56:30.121 --> 01:56:32.250
<v Speaker 4>it's not just the jewels that you were or you know,</v>

3770
01:56:32.251 --> 01:56:36.570
<v Speaker 4>like that's a thing you give your girlfriend a diamond and then they wear it.</v>

3771
01:56:36.570 --> 01:56:37.110
<v Speaker 4>Are there,</v>

3772
01:56:37.110 --> 01:56:38.100
<v Speaker 4>some women are,</v>

3773
01:56:38.270 --> 01:56:38.791
<v Speaker 4>so you know,</v>

3774
01:56:38.791 --> 01:56:39.421
<v Speaker 4>like the thing,</v>

3775
01:56:39.421 --> 01:56:39.851
<v Speaker 4>it's like a,</v>

3776
01:56:39.851 --> 01:56:42.900
<v Speaker 4>it's a boring class shea in movies where it's like,</v>

3777
01:56:43.170 --> 01:56:43.531

3780
01:56:47.581 --> 01:56:48.630
<v Speaker 4>it's a big deal.</v>

3781
01:56:48.780 --> 01:56:50.700
<v Speaker 4>That's just so funny the way that we,</v>

3782
01:56:51.030 --> 01:56:53.670
<v Speaker 4>those things are going to be outdated with augmented reality.</v>

3783
01:56:53.671 --> 01:56:58.671
<v Speaker 4>It's going to be certain add ons to your physical form that you can only obtain</v>

3784
01:56:59.010 --> 01:57:00.210

3789
01:57:07.980 --> 01:57:09.000

<v Speaker 4>Get all the reality stuff out while you can.</v>

3803
01:57:26.340 --> 01:57:26.970
<v Speaker 4>That's right.</v>

3804
01:57:26.970 --> 01:57:27.900
<v Speaker 4>Within a hundred years,</v>

3805
01:57:27.901 --> 01:57:28.860
<v Speaker 4>it's not going to be here.</v>

3806
01:57:29.010 --> 01:57:31.800
<v Speaker 4>We're all going to be living inside a cloud 10 10 years,</v>

3807
01:57:31.801 --> 01:57:32.370
<v Speaker 4>10 years.</v>

3808
01:57:32.370 --> 01:57:32.640
<v Speaker 4>Geez.</v>

3809
01:57:32.640 --> 01:57:34.140
<v Speaker 4>I'd say 10 I mean 10 years in,</v>

3810
01:57:34.141 --> 01:57:35.460
<v Speaker 4>we're all in some odd,</v>

3811
01:57:35.461 --> 01:57:38.730
<v Speaker 4>we're all aware it using some form of augmented reality technology,</v>

3812
01:57:39.640 --> 01:57:40.800
<v Speaker 4>but all these people,</v>

3813
01:57:40.801 --> 01:57:40.981
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

3814
01:57:40.981 --> 01:57:41.970
<v Speaker 4>when you ask them,</v>

3815
01:57:42.150 --> 01:57:44.700
<v Speaker 4>the people who are really like in the know about this,</v>

3816
01:57:44.701 --> 01:57:47.400
<v Speaker 4>when you ask them what do you predict in 10 years,</v>

3817
01:57:47.401 --> 01:57:47.790
<v Speaker 4>they're like,</v>

3818
01:57:47.790 --> 01:57:48.623
<v Speaker 4>they're like,</v>

3819
01:57:49.230 --> 01:57:50.340
<v Speaker 4>forget it man.</v>

3820
01:57:50.360 --> 01:57:50.520
<v Speaker 4>You,</v>

3821
01:57:50.520 --> 01:57:55.520
<v Speaker 4>you want me to tell you what things are gonna look like when they're five times</v>

3822
01:57:55.561 --> 01:57:57.180
<v Speaker 4>as fast as they are now?</v>

3823
01:57:57.360 --> 01:57:58.530
<v Speaker 4>That's what you want me to tell you.</v>

3824
01:57:58.710 --> 01:58:03.710
<v Speaker 4>You want me to predict what kind of innovations come from an apple computer five</v>

3825
01:58:03.901 --> 01:58:06.870
<v Speaker 4>times as fast as the fastest apple computer on planet earth?</v>

3826
01:58:07.290 --> 01:58:08.310
<v Speaker 4>I can't do that.</v>

3827
01:58:08.460 --> 01:58:09.900
<v Speaker 4>It's impossible to guess.</v>

3828
01:58:10.110 --> 01:58:11.160
<v Speaker 4>We don't know.</v>

3829
01:58:11.400 --> 01:58:13.440
<v Speaker 4>It's a big fucking question mark.</v>

3830
01:58:13.650 --> 01:58:15.510
<v Speaker 4>Especially when you start talking about decades.</v>

3831

<v Speaker 4>how,</v>

3840
01:58:24.491 --> 01:58:28.410
<v Speaker 4>how accurately would you have predicted some of the things happening right now</v>

3841
01:58:28.650 --> 01:58:31.410
<v Speaker 4>and I wouldn't have predicted Uber.</v>

3842
01:58:31.680 --> 01:58:33.390
<v Speaker 4>You wouldn't have predicted most things.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Who would have predicted podcasts?</v>

3845
01:58:36.480 --> 01:58:36.910
<v Speaker 4>Let's go there.</v>

3846
01:58:36.910 --> 01:58:37.740
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>

01:58:37.740 --> 01:58:38.190
<v Speaker 4>that's right.</v>

3848
01:58:38.190 --> 01:58:41.440
<v Speaker 4>Do you remember that Christian Slater movie where he was the rebel that was</v>

3849
01:58:41.441 --> 01:58:42.370
<v Speaker 4>broadcasting</v>

3850
01:58:42.370 --> 01:58:44.020
<v Speaker 3>the pirate radio show?</v>

3851
01:58:44.140 --> 01:58:44.741
<v Speaker 3>Do you remember that?</v>

3852
01:58:44.741 --> 01:58:46.030
<v Speaker 3>He had a run and hide.</v>

3853
01:58:46.750 --> 01:58:47.620
<v Speaker 3>He was broadcasting</v>

3854
01:58:49.550 --> 01:58:52.120
<v Speaker 3>out that it's so funny.</v>

3855
01:58:52.660 --> 01:58:54.220
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to have to watch that to tie it up,</v>

3856
01:58:54.221 --> 01:58:55.054
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

3857
01:58:55.350 --> 01:58:57.400
<v Speaker 3>He's fucking going to play the cool songs.</v>

3858
01:58:57.490 --> 01:59:00.040
<v Speaker 3>Not that fucking Jessie's girl bullshit.</v>

3859
01:59:00.070 --> 01:59:00.910
<v Speaker 3>You listening to</v>

3860
01:59:04.110 --> 01:59:04.320
<v Speaker 3>me?</v>

01:59:04.320 --> 01:59:04.510
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3862
01:59:04.510 --> 01:59:06.400
<v Speaker 3>Jessie's girl is a bad ass jam.</v>

3863
01:59:06.900 --> 01:59:07.733
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

3864
01:59:07.900 --> 01:59:09.890
<v Speaker 3>Maybe Christian Slater just has obscure tastes.</v>

3865
01:59:09.891 --> 01:59:10.960
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't have to shove it down,</v>

3866
01:59:10.961 --> 01:59:11.350
<v Speaker 3>throw it.</v>

3867
01:59:11.350 --> 01:59:14.680
<v Speaker 3>What he needs to do it was by a god damn radio license like everybody else.</v>

3868
01:59:14.700 --> 01:59:14.910
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3869
01:59:14.910 --> 01:59:16.350
<v Speaker 3>I'll set up a business or</v>

3870
01:59:19.180 --> 01:59:20.013
<v Speaker 3>government.</v>

3871
01:59:20.620 --> 01:59:21.610
<v Speaker 3>Why doesn't he do that?</v>

3872
01:59:21.640 --> 01:59:22.990
<v Speaker 3>Why does he have to be a pirate?</v>

3873
01:59:23.020 --> 01:59:24.580
<v Speaker 3>He needs to get licensed,</v>

3874
01:59:24.670 --> 01:59:25.570
<v Speaker 3>get licensed,</v>

3875
01:59:25.571 --> 01:59:30.571
<v Speaker 3>pay the government there due to criminal broadcasting music through the sky</v>

3876
01:59:31.271 --> 01:59:32.440
<v Speaker 3>without a license.</v>

3877
01:59:32.690 --> 01:59:33.640
<v Speaker 3>It's ridiculous.</v>

3878
01:59:33.641 --> 01:59:34.100
<v Speaker 3>He had a,</v>

3879
01:59:34.100 --> 01:59:36.610
<v Speaker 3>he had a fucking dangerous situation.</v>

3880
01:59:36.611 --> 01:59:37.750
<v Speaker 3>He was running from the cops,</v>

3881
01:59:37.751 --> 01:59:42.640
<v Speaker 3>but it was more important to him to continue broadcasting shitty music over the</v>

3882
01:59:42.641 --> 01:59:46.270
<v Speaker 3>forbidden skies to fight the found that it was to stay free.</v>

3883
01:59:46.540 --> 01:59:47.860
<v Speaker 3>He was going to take chances.</v>

3884
01:59:48.070 --> 01:59:49.090

<v Speaker 3>He needs to do roadhouse.</v>

3991
02:02:36.950 --> 02:02:39.860
<v Speaker 3>That'd be amazing to his version of how he needs to do anything.</v>

3992
02:02:39.861 --> 02:02:40.970
<v Speaker 3>That's one of the hang on its own.</v>

02:02:50.540 --> 02:02:51.500

<v Speaker 3>Danny Mcbride and for that's the Sam guy with the thick mustache.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Some people are going to use symbols,</v>

4118
02:06:00.211 --> 02:06:03.420
<v Speaker 1>structures to try to make the world a better place and some people are going to</v>

4119
02:06:03.421 --> 02:06:03.961
<v Speaker 1>use symbols,</v>

4120
02:06:03.961 --> 02:06:05.340
<v Speaker 1>structures to punchy with.</v>

4121
02:06:05.520 --> 02:06:10.230
<v Speaker 1>It's like somebody who's like putting on like a a a boxing glove.</v>

4122
02:06:10.280 --> 02:06:12.240
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's like a velvet glove.</v>

4123
02:06:12.241 --> 02:06:13.890
<v Speaker 1>It's like someone punching you with velvet.</v>

4124
02:06:13.891 --> 02:06:14.071
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

4125
02:06:14.071 --> 02:06:15.240
<v Speaker 1>there's still punching me.</v>

4126
02:06:15.450 --> 02:06:18.780
<v Speaker 1>That's why it feels like shit when you get around people who are inflicting</v>

4127
02:06:18.781 --> 02:06:20.370
<v Speaker 1>their aggression on you at some kind of,</v>

4128
02:06:21.060 --> 02:06:22.830
<v Speaker 1>I think it's ultimately a good lesson though.</v>

4129
02:06:22.850 --> 02:06:23.850
<v Speaker 1>It's told to me less than that.</v>

4130
02:06:24.210 --> 02:06:25.043
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

4131
02:06:25.160 --> 02:06:29.090
<v Speaker 5>there's no real one ideology that's got it nailed and you're going to have</v>

4132
02:06:29.091 --> 02:06:30.950
<v Speaker 5>weirdos in every single group.</v>

4133
02:06:31.220 --> 02:06:31.750
<v Speaker 5>And the,</v>

4134
02:06:31.750 --> 02:06:35.540
<v Speaker 5>the real thing that we have to all sort of come to some sort of an agreement on</v>

4135
02:06:35.810 --> 02:06:37.430
<v Speaker 5>is that we're all part of this organism,</v>

4136
02:06:37.460 --> 02:06:37.730
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

4137
02:06:37.730 --> 02:06:37.971
<v Speaker 5>That's,</v>

4138
02:06:37.971 --> 02:06:39.140
<v Speaker 5>that's what we keep getting to.</v>

4139
02:06:39.260 --> 02:06:42.890
<v Speaker 5>The only way to fix this thing is if we all really do have some sort of ultimate</v>

4140
02:06:42.891 --> 02:06:43.161
<v Speaker 5>power.</v>

4141
02:06:43.161 --> 02:06:46.790
<v Speaker 5>Like if technology continues to exponentially increase the point where the</v>

4142
02:06:46.791 --> 02:06:50.620
<v Speaker 5>average person can just hit the universe reset switch is,</v>

4143
02:06:50.670 --> 02:06:51.740
<v Speaker 5>there's too much power.</v>

4144
02:06:51.780 --> 02:06:52.250
<v Speaker 5>There's just,</v>

4145
02:06:52.250 --> 02:06:57.250
<v Speaker 5>it becomes some crazy singularity moment where the average person has waiting,</v>

4146
02:06:58.511 --> 02:07:03.050
<v Speaker 5>you mean the power that you have and your phone is so indescribable to someone</v>

4147
02:07:03.051 --> 02:07:04.160
<v Speaker 5>who lived in ancient Rome.</v>

4148
02:07:04.360 --> 02:07:04.730
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

4149
02:07:04.730 --> 02:07:05.720
<v Speaker 5>it's indescribable.</v>

4150
02:07:05.990 --> 02:07:08.810
<v Speaker 5>And if it continues that way and somehow or another,</v>

4151
02:07:08.811 --> 02:07:12.710
<v Speaker 5>the cat gets out of the bag and they invent some way to literally,</v>

4152
02:07:12.740 --> 02:07:16.730
<v Speaker 5>everybody has the power to stop life as we know it at any given time.</v>

4153
02:07:16.790 --> 02:07:17.260
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4154
02:07:17.260 --> 02:07:17.811
<v Speaker 5>It was the oldest.</v>

4155
02:07:17.811 --> 02:07:22.811
<v Speaker 5>The only way everybody looks at everybody as just as important is that it's</v>

4156
02:07:23.121 --> 02:07:24.860
<v Speaker 5>really almost the only way to cure the disease.</v>

4157
02:07:24.861 --> 02:07:26.840
<v Speaker 5>That is the craziness of humanity,</v>

4158
02:07:27.050 --> 02:07:28.430
<v Speaker 5>the craziness of humanities,</v>

4159
02:07:28.431 --> 02:07:31.430
<v Speaker 5>like this weird thing where we can,</v>

4160
02:07:31.460 --> 02:07:33.320
<v Speaker 5>we can be to human beings,</v>

4161
02:07:33.530 --> 02:07:38.530
<v Speaker 5>can either be madly love or the best of friends are so appreciative of each</v>

4162
02:07:38.801 --> 02:07:43.690
<v Speaker 5>other or at each other's throats trying to kill each other with their fingers.</v>

4163
02:07:43.691 --> 02:07:47.770
<v Speaker 5>There's no real present shit like trying to hit each other in the head with</v>

4164
02:07:47.771 --> 02:07:48.604
<v Speaker 5>rocks fighting.</v>

4165
02:07:49.420 --> 02:07:53.610
<v Speaker 5>It could easily happen one way or the other and the amount of times,</v>

4166
02:07:53.611 --> 02:07:56.530
<v Speaker 5>and it happens the right way is incredible.</v>

4167
02:07:56.830 --> 02:07:58.870
<v Speaker 5>If you look at the numbers that we're dealing with,</v>

4168
02:07:59.110 --> 02:08:01.660
<v Speaker 5>300 plus million people in this country,</v>

4169
02:08:01.870 --> 02:08:06.700
<v Speaker 5>the amount of kindness and the amount of happiness is off the charts,</v>

4170
02:08:06.780 --> 02:08:07.050
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

4171
02:08:07.050 --> 02:08:08.500
<v Speaker 5>Just not salacious.</v>

4172
02:08:08.501 --> 02:08:09.700
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't draw us in.</v>

4173
02:08:09.940 --> 02:08:11.200
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't scare us,</v>

4174
02:08:11.260 --> 02:08:12.580
<v Speaker 5>so we don't focus on it.</v>

4175
02:08:12.730 --> 02:08:14.500
<v Speaker 5>And by not focusing on it in his stead,</v>

4176
02:08:14.501 --> 02:08:19.501
<v Speaker 5>focusing on fear or focusing on hay or focusing on blame,</v>

4177
02:08:19.930 --> 02:08:24.930
<v Speaker 5>we sorta perpetrate it and the more people could focus on figuring out a way to</v>

4178
02:08:28.301 --> 02:08:32.410
<v Speaker 5>just interface as nicely with all the people around you as possible,</v>

4179
02:08:32.740 --> 02:08:35.680
<v Speaker 5>as friendly and easily with all the people around you as possible.</v>

4180
02:08:36.070 --> 02:08:37.810
<v Speaker 5>The more you can figure out a way to do that,</v>

4181
02:08:38.140 --> 02:08:41.020
<v Speaker 5>the better off the whole planet is in a whipple,</v>

4182
02:08:41.260 --> 02:08:43.180
<v Speaker 5>it'll rip and there's going to be people that violate it.</v>

4183
02:08:43.390 --> 02:08:44.830
<v Speaker 5>It's going to be people that don't play along.</v>

4184
02:08:44.831 --> 02:08:48.460
<v Speaker 5>It's going to be built to try to exploit it and fucked up just a man or man.</v>

4185
02:08:48.640 --> 02:08:50.200
<v Speaker 5>Eventually we'll figure that out.</v>

4186
02:08:50.280 --> 02:08:51.940
<v Speaker 5>Eventually we'll overwhelm that.</v>

4187
02:08:51.941 --> 02:08:56.941
<v Speaker 5>There's a new ethic and a new ethic is brought about by this way that we</v>

4188
02:08:57.101 --> 02:08:57.940
<v Speaker 5>communicate now.</v>

4189
02:08:57.970 --> 02:08:58.570
<v Speaker 5>That's right.</v>

4190
02:08:58.570 --> 02:08:59.890
<v Speaker 5>That doesn't exist before</v>

4191
02:08:59.960 --> 02:09:00.140
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

4192
02:09:00.140 --> 02:09:03.030
<v Speaker 4>and I think also you have to become,</v>

4193
02:09:03.630 --> 02:09:06.870
<v Speaker 4>you have to become a person of action like your friend or you're talking about.</v>

4194
02:09:06.871 --> 02:09:07.704
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>

4195
02:09:08.100 --> 02:09:10.290
<v Speaker 4>he's helping people get water in the Congo.</v>

4196
02:09:10.350 --> 02:09:10.800
<v Speaker 4>Dude,</v>

4197
02:09:10.800 --> 02:09:12.750
<v Speaker 4>anyone listening can become that guy.</v>

4198
02:09:13.140 --> 02:09:17.550
<v Speaker 4>Anyone listening right now can start taking steps in the direction of doing</v>

4199
02:09:17.730 --> 02:09:18.210
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

4200
02:09:18.210 --> 02:09:19.140
<v Speaker 5>And if you don't have time,</v>

4201
02:09:19.141 --> 02:09:20.460
<v Speaker 5>go to fight for the forgotten.</v>
