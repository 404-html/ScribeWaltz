1
00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:03.460
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

2
00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:05.480
<v Speaker 1>Forgot to tell you this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

3
00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.100
<v Speaker 1>So when I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was having some pretty good thoughts</v>

4
00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:09.940
<v Speaker 1>on this acid watching some different</v>
<v Speaker 1>pants.</v>

5
00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:11.650
<v Speaker 1>The killers by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking killed it.</v>

6
00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:13.930
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

7
00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.360
<v Speaker 1>so I've tried,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see stuff in like when you're out</v>

8
00:00:17.361 --> 00:00:18.800
<v Speaker 1>there on second dog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so truth,</v>

9
00:00:18.801 --> 00:00:21.500
<v Speaker 1>I call them universal truths where you</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like,</v>

10
00:00:21.501 --> 00:00:22.580
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is real.</v>

11
00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:24.170
<v Speaker 1>That is right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>100%.</v>

12
00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.170
<v Speaker 1>And it's hard to bring that shit back</v>
<v Speaker 1>into this realm,</v>

13
00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:29.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to understand it and trying to get us</v>

14
00:00:29.121 --> 00:00:33.800
<v Speaker 1>kicked off youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's passing car.</v>

15
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:35.870
<v Speaker 1>So it's hard when you come back to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

16
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.700
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw the truth of something and then</v>

17
00:00:37.701 --> 00:00:39.230
<v Speaker 1>it's like I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can't express it.</v>

18
00:00:39.231 --> 00:00:40.640
<v Speaker 1>And when people come back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they're around you,</v>

19
00:00:40.641 --> 00:00:42.020
<v Speaker 1>they say something and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

20
00:00:42.021 --> 00:00:43.850
<v Speaker 1>And they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they realized that get frustrated.</v>

21
00:00:43.851 --> 00:00:46.160
<v Speaker 1>They're not saying it right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it's slowly going away.</v>

22
00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when I was there in that place,</v>

23
00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.790
<v Speaker 1>sometimes I try to remember like when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get back say this to this person,</v>

24
00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.780
<v Speaker 1>so that state told me to tell you the M</v>
<v Speaker 1>and m is one of the realest MCS.</v>

25
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to argue with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know</v>

26
00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.530
<v Speaker 1>what exactly</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was like does that could be a</v>

27
00:01:14.561 --> 00:01:17.440
<v Speaker 1>funny bit dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a funny bit in there like about</v>

28
00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.200
<v Speaker 1>how like some things are just in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>moment.</v>

29
00:01:20.201 --> 00:01:24.010
<v Speaker 1>They seem so profound and then I'd be</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

30
00:01:24.011 --> 00:01:27.450
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is wrong with me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And My name was one of the real estate</v>

31
00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:28.990
<v Speaker 1>MCS.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would agree with that?</v>

32
00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.861
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he's very,</v>

33
00:01:29.861 --> 00:01:31.590
<v Speaker 1>very real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems fairly</v>

34
00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:35.240
<v Speaker 2>brill and leary almost certainly played</v>
<v Speaker 2>a role,</v>

35
00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:39.830
<v Speaker 2>but I think it's slightly ironic that</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a journalist and didn't really go</v>

36
00:01:39.831 --> 00:01:42.680
<v Speaker 2>that deep into the role that journalists</v>
<v Speaker 2>played in all of this,</v>

37
00:01:42.681 --> 00:01:44.110
<v Speaker 2>which was humongous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

38
00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:49.190
<v Speaker 2>journalists are sculptors of public</v>
<v Speaker 2>opinion and it became the standard way</v>

39
00:01:49.191 --> 00:01:52.160
<v Speaker 2>of reporting on any of these things to</v>
<v Speaker 2>say that they're bad,</v>

40
00:01:52.161 --> 00:01:56.360
<v Speaker 2>to sensationalize it and to not have any</v>
<v Speaker 2>consideration for what that would do.</v>

41
00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.970
<v Speaker 2>Because anytime a journalist writes him</v>
<v Speaker 2>scare story,</v>

42
00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:03.870
<v Speaker 2>they can really mess with drug policy in</v>
<v Speaker 2>a serious way.</v>

43
00:02:03.871 --> 00:02:05.340
<v Speaker 2>It might seem like nothing like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

44
00:02:05.341 --> 00:02:09.930
<v Speaker 2>there's a bunch of people in Brooklyn</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they overdosed on some obscure</v>

45
00:02:09.931 --> 00:02:13.890
<v Speaker 2>synthetic cannabinoid amb food Bendeka</v>
<v Speaker 2>who cares about amb food?</v>

46
00:02:13.891 --> 00:02:17.040
<v Speaker 2>Banika no big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Say that it turns people into zombies</v>

47
00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.530
<v Speaker 2>and if it gets thrown into schedule one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who cares?</v>

48
00:02:19.531 --> 00:02:20.364
<v Speaker 2>Not a big deal.</v>

49
00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.980
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a very short sighted way of</v>

50
00:02:22.981 --> 00:02:25.710
<v Speaker 2>thinking about all of this because</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's exactly what happened with</v>

51
00:02:25.711 --> 00:02:30.570
<v Speaker 2>psychedelics and then we're not learning</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the mistakes of the past that just</v>

52
00:02:30.571 --> 00:02:33.630
<v Speaker 2>because something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's fun to sensationalize and talk</v>

53
00:02:33.631 --> 00:02:35.790
<v Speaker 2>about how dangerous it is at this</v>
<v Speaker 2>moment.</v>

54
00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.370
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't mean that 10 years from now</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to recognize that it has</v>

55
00:02:38.371 --> 00:02:42.420
<v Speaker 2>serious therapeutic potential and we</v>
<v Speaker 2>made a big mistake outlawing it.</v>

56
00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.260
<v Speaker 2>And I think a lot of that also comes</v>
<v Speaker 2>from this sort of us versus them</v>

57
00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.710
<v Speaker 2>mentality that people have where it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>cannabis is good.</v>

58
00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:51.930
<v Speaker 2>Synthetic cannabinoids are bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

59
00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.380
<v Speaker 2>synthetic cannabinoids don't have to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>bad for cannabis to be good.</v>

60
00:02:55.381 --> 00:02:59.070
<v Speaker 2>Cannabis can be good without something</v>
<v Speaker 2>else being bad to counter balance.</v>

61
00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:02.080
<v Speaker 2>You don't need to hate something to</v>
<v Speaker 2>justify your love of cannabis.</v>

62
00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:05.890
<v Speaker 2>And this whole hatred of synthetic</v>
<v Speaker 2>cannabinoids I think is totally</v>

63
00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.360
<v Speaker 2>misdirected because these are products</v>
<v Speaker 2>of prohibition that most people wouldn't</v>

64
00:03:10.361 --> 00:03:12.220
<v Speaker 2>even want to use in the first place.</v>

65
00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.740
<v Speaker 2>And when they do use them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't know what they're taking.</v>

66
00:03:14.741 --> 00:03:16.420
<v Speaker 2>They don't know what dose they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>consuming.</v>

67
00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.030
<v Speaker 2>And so of course they're having bad</v>
<v Speaker 2>experiences that would happen with</v>

68
00:03:19.031 --> 00:03:21.730
<v Speaker 2>almost any drug.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Caffeine included if people just</v>

69
00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:25.840
<v Speaker 2>consumed enormous unmeasured doses</v>
<v Speaker 2>without having any idea what they were</v>

70
00:03:25.841 --> 00:03:28.600
<v Speaker 2>getting into.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so they're thrown into schedule one.</v>

71
00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:33.550
<v Speaker 2>What happens if 30 years from now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once the therapeutic potential of</v>

72
00:03:33.551 --> 00:03:36.220
<v Speaker 2>cannabinoids is being really seriously</v>
<v Speaker 2>explored,</v>

73
00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.730
<v Speaker 2>we find out that that Ambi [inaudible]</v>
<v Speaker 2>that everyone was saying turn homeless</v>

74
00:03:39.731 --> 00:03:44.560
<v Speaker 2>people into zombies in Brooklyn in 2017</v>
<v Speaker 2>turns out to activate a certain subtype</v>

75
00:03:44.561 --> 00:03:48.310
<v Speaker 2>of the CB one receptor that's especially</v>
<v Speaker 2>useful for Parkinson's disease or</v>

76
00:03:48.311 --> 00:03:51.100
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then we're going to regret having done</v>

77
00:03:51.101 --> 00:03:52.900
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think people have to be very</v>

78
00:03:52.901 --> 00:03:55.060
<v Speaker 2>careful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anytime you say anything negative about</v>

79
00:03:55.061 --> 00:03:56.110
<v Speaker 2>a drug,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to be very,</v>

80
00:03:56.111 --> 00:03:58.840
<v Speaker 2>very careful because the implications</v>
<v Speaker 2>can be enormous.</v>

81
00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:03.960
<v Speaker 2>I think that the best stance and all of</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is to not speak ill of drug,</v>

82
00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:09.270
<v Speaker 3>any drug.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The drugs have breakthrough drug</v>

83
00:04:09.271 --> 00:04:12.000
<v Speaker 3>enthusiasm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But also if you really think about the</v>

84
00:04:12.001 --> 00:04:17.001
<v Speaker 3>fact that we are in a world where people</v>
<v Speaker 3>have to go to work to do a job,</v>

85
00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:21.120
<v Speaker 3>that by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

86
00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.810
<v Speaker 3>if there is a dude you need to get on</v>
<v Speaker 3>this podcast and there's a book that you</v>

87
00:04:24.811 --> 00:04:27.480
<v Speaker 3>would love,</v>
<v Speaker 3>David Graber wrote this book called</v>

88
00:04:27.481 --> 00:04:30.990
<v Speaker 3>Bullshit Jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This guy is a fucking genius man.</v>

89
00:04:30.991 --> 00:04:35.100
<v Speaker 3>And this book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bullshit jobs breaks down the phenomena</v>

90
00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:36.310
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

91
00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:39.420
<v Speaker 3>how many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many people are working in jobs that</v>

92
00:04:39.421 --> 00:04:43.350
<v Speaker 3>don't do anything for the world or the</v>
<v Speaker 3>company they're working for.</v>

93
00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.050
<v Speaker 3>And it's not like this judgmental thing</v>
<v Speaker 3>where he's like,</v>

94
00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:47.700
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a bullshit job.</v>

95
00:04:47.701 --> 00:04:48.320
<v Speaker 3>You're a blah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blah,</v>

96
00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:49.350
<v Speaker 3>blah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's one of the,</v>

97
00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:52.170
<v Speaker 3>he's like an anthropologist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he's very precise.</v>

98
00:04:52.171 --> 00:04:56.730
<v Speaker 3>But one of the qualifications for your</v>
<v Speaker 3>job to be a bullshit job is you know,</v>

99
00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:59.250
<v Speaker 3>that it's really kind of a worthless</v>
<v Speaker 3>job.</v>

100
00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:02.850
<v Speaker 3>It's not really doing anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And like the companies have gotten so</v>

101
00:05:02.851 --> 00:05:06.230
<v Speaker 3>fucking big that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

102
00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:10.170
<v Speaker 3>they end up having like departments or</v>
<v Speaker 3>people running departments or extra</v>

103
00:05:10.171 --> 00:05:15.171
<v Speaker 3>employees that don't really need to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>there at all and they have to pretend to</v>

104
00:05:17.851 --> 00:05:20.430
<v Speaker 3>be to work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what he writes about.</v>

105
00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:24.720
<v Speaker 3>He writes it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you really want to torture a person,</v>

106
00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:28.560
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not only give them like the job of like,</v>

107
00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:30.690
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pouring a glass of water and an empty</v>

108
00:05:30.691 --> 00:05:34.350
<v Speaker 3>glass and pouring it back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then add to it,</v>

109
00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:40.130
<v Speaker 3>did they have to deceive their boss into</v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking that they're like doing an</v>

110
00:05:40.811 --> 00:05:44.950
<v Speaker 3>important job or they lose their job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So these not only are these,</v>

111
00:05:44.951 --> 00:05:49.780
<v Speaker 3>like some corporations and companies</v>
<v Speaker 3>scanning your pis to see if you're</v>

112
00:05:49.781 --> 00:05:54.781
<v Speaker 3>taking a substance that is allowing you</v>
<v Speaker 3>to connect with home what you actually</v>

113
00:05:55.961 --> 00:06:00.200
<v Speaker 3>are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They are demanding that you spend many</v>

114
00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:04.910
<v Speaker 3>hours a day lying to them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you're doing work that you're not</v>

115
00:06:04.911 --> 00:06:05.744
<v Speaker 3>doing.</v>

116
00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:07.280
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're fucking efficient,</v>

117
00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:09.980
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is another thing I graybar</v>

118
00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:11.700
<v Speaker 3>writes about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>forgive me David Graver.</v>

119
00:06:11.701 --> 00:06:16.701
<v Speaker 3>If in any way I'd misconstrue this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I read your writings stoned,</v>

120
00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:17.750
<v Speaker 3>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

121
00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:18.710
<v Speaker 3>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

122
00:06:18.711 --> 00:06:20.110
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

123
00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:25.210
<v Speaker 3>the other fucking element to it that is</v>
<v Speaker 3>absolutely atrocious and fucking</v>

124
00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:29.780
<v Speaker 3>horrible is that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

125
00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:32.090
<v Speaker 3>these substances are connecting is to</v>
<v Speaker 3>home.</v>

126
00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:36.680
<v Speaker 3>They don't want us to be in those states</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they're asking us to fucking lie all</v>

127
00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:38.810
<v Speaker 3>day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know what psychedelic means?</v>

128
00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:41.170
<v Speaker 3>The etymology of psychedelic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

129
00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:46.060
<v Speaker 3>it means mind manifesting or sole</v>
<v Speaker 3>manifesting,</v>

130
00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:50.020
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So a psychedelic connects us potentially</v>

131
00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:52.480
<v Speaker 3>with the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what we are,</v>

132
00:06:52.481 --> 00:06:54.070
<v Speaker 3>our identity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

133
00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:58.240
<v Speaker 3>And these companies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're asking us to lie,</v>

134
00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:02.720
<v Speaker 3>to be the opposite of our identities,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to wear weird a suit or,</v>

135
00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:05.890
<v Speaker 3>or some kind of dress code.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And to sit in a desk where,</v>

136
00:07:05.891 --> 00:07:09.970
<v Speaker 3>because you're efficient,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get your job done in 45 minutes and</v>

137
00:07:09.971 --> 00:07:12.400
<v Speaker 3>for the next six hours you got to sit</v>
<v Speaker 3>and</v>

138
00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:16.740
<v Speaker 3>type in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pretend that you're working.</v>

139
00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:21.580
<v Speaker 4>It was an ongoing maneuver of mine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We'd have these hippie writers come in</v>

140
00:07:21.581 --> 00:07:23.680
<v Speaker 4>to take notes and I'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

141
00:07:23.681 --> 00:07:27.310
<v Speaker 4>I played this fender stratocaster as I</v>
<v Speaker 4>hold up my Gibson Birdland,</v>

142
00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:29.380
<v Speaker 4>which was known for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they'd write down,</v>

143
00:07:29.381 --> 00:07:34.020
<v Speaker 4>he played in a Gibson a stratocaster.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no such thing as the gifts</v>

144
00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:38.410
<v Speaker 4>reddick guest.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I was having fun with dirt bag anti</v>

145
00:07:38.411 --> 00:07:40.840
<v Speaker 4>journalists.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So now I'm invited to high times</v>

146
00:07:40.841 --> 00:07:45.841
<v Speaker 4>magazine and I was hardcore anti-drug.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I go in and this guy is and here's</v>

147
00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:50.190
<v Speaker 4>typically,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

148
00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:56.020
<v Speaker 4>so uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>tell me about a GSI amboy Dukes,</v>

149
00:07:56.030 --> 00:07:58.720
<v Speaker 4>what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like a band?</v>

150
00:07:58.820 --> 00:07:59.351
<v Speaker 4>And I went,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

151
00:07:59.351 --> 00:08:03.850
<v Speaker 4>it's like a band.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's almost exactly like a band kind</v>

152
00:08:03.851 --> 00:08:05.080
<v Speaker 4>of a question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is this,</v>

153
00:08:05.650 --> 00:08:08.420
<v Speaker 4>how did this all started still draft</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sony?</v>

154
00:08:08.421 --> 00:08:12.130
<v Speaker 4>How we started talking about when I'm</v>
<v Speaker 4>with the MC five and the stooges and we</v>

155
00:08:12.131 --> 00:08:13.480
<v Speaker 4>would party and I go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah man,</v>

156
00:08:13.481 --> 00:08:14.620
<v Speaker 4>I was snorting something.</v>

157
00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:16.090
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

158
00:08:16.091 --> 00:08:17.650
<v Speaker 4>I just got higher than a kite.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he goes,</v>

159
00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:19.990
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you think I might've been a crystal</v>

160
00:08:19.991 --> 00:08:20.471
<v Speaker 4>meth?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I mean,</v>

161
00:08:20.471 --> 00:08:21.640
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what they called it.</v>

162
00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:24.940
<v Speaker 4>I never snorted crystal meth and ups and</v>
<v Speaker 4>shit just went nuts.</v>

163
00:08:24.941 --> 00:08:27.310
<v Speaker 4>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we went into the war thing and I go,</v>

164
00:08:27.311 --> 00:08:28.780
<v Speaker 4>I don't know anything about war.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a,</v>

165
00:08:28.781 --> 00:08:31.630
<v Speaker 4>I'm a guitar player.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I went down from my draft physical</v>

166
00:08:31.631 --> 00:08:34.870
<v Speaker 4>and when I went into the booth to give</v>
<v Speaker 4>my urine sample,</v>

167
00:08:34.871 --> 00:08:38.740
<v Speaker 4>I made sure I ate Mexican food all week.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So instead of pissing in the Urine Cup,</v>

168
00:08:38.741 --> 00:08:41.740
<v Speaker 4>I took a big dump in it was green and</v>
<v Speaker 4>went all over the place and the guy</v>

169
00:08:41.741 --> 00:08:43.600
<v Speaker 4>went,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wow.</v>

170
00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:46.440
<v Speaker 4>He really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

171
00:08:46.450 --> 00:08:49.960
<v Speaker 4>really.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so I made up the story for High</v>

172
00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:50.860
<v Speaker 4>Times magazine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

173
00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:55.360
<v Speaker 4>the great magazine of good information</v>
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>

174
00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:57.750
<v Speaker 4>embed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It turned out that my drummer,</v>

175
00:08:57.751 --> 00:08:58.880
<v Speaker 4>Kj night,</v>
<v Speaker 4>God bless him,</v>

176
00:08:58.881 --> 00:08:59.181
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jack,</v>

177
00:08:59.181 --> 00:09:03.120
<v Speaker 4>she admitted this in and testified that</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what he did.</v>

178
00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:06.250
<v Speaker 4>We thought it was the funniest thing in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the world.</v>

179
00:09:06.251 --> 00:09:09.460
<v Speaker 4>We're teenagers and this guy went into</v>
<v Speaker 4>the draft physical,</v>

180
00:09:09.461 --> 00:09:13.900
<v Speaker 4>just an absolute near death,</v>
<v Speaker 4>lumpy shit to get out of the draft.</v>

181
00:09:14.050 --> 00:09:17.110
<v Speaker 4>And we thought it was funnier and hell.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We weren't paying attention to important</v>

182
00:09:17.111 --> 00:09:19.060
<v Speaker 4>things in life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so the,</v>

183
00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:24.240
<v Speaker 4>the Ted Hating liberal press started</v>
<v Speaker 4>quoting the high times magazine and</v>

184
00:09:26.081 --> 00:09:30.790
<v Speaker 4>quoting an ex girlfriend who claimed</v>
<v Speaker 4>that I adopted her,</v>

185
00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:34.670
<v Speaker 4>did her,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I adopted my girlfriend.</v>

186
00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:36.740
<v Speaker 4>If you read that one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I did read that one.</v>

187
00:09:36.741 --> 00:09:39.650
<v Speaker 4>I forgot about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So this kind of stuff,</v>

188
00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:42.710
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you adopted her so you could take her on</v>

189
00:09:42.711 --> 00:09:44.720
<v Speaker 4>tour with Ya know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I could fucker,</v>

190
00:09:44.930 --> 00:09:48.490
<v Speaker 4>that's what the story was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that's Ab.</v>

191
00:09:48.890 --> 00:09:50.780
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that's how it works.</v>

192
00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:52.730
<v Speaker 4>That's not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it makes it easier to talk</v>

193
00:09:52.731 --> 00:09:53.660
<v Speaker 4>than once you adopt them.</v>

194
00:09:53.830 --> 00:09:58.830
<v Speaker 4>I didn't adopt anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I never shit my pants since I was eight</v>

195
00:10:00.291 --> 00:10:01.480
<v Speaker 4>months old.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

196
00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:04.670
<v Speaker 4>I've never been with an underage girl</v>
<v Speaker 4>since I was under age.</v>

197
00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.040
<v Speaker 4>I'm not a racist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And what else do they say?</v>

198
00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:08.720
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they seem that they claimed that I</v>

199
00:10:08.721 --> 00:10:11.180
<v Speaker 4>made Courtney love blow me when she was</v>
<v Speaker 4>12.</v>

200
00:10:11.270 --> 00:10:12.950
<v Speaker 4>I think she claimed that I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

201
00:10:12.951 --> 00:10:16.070
<v Speaker 4>I never met Courtney love.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can tell I don't have a rash.</v>

202
00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:18.770
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you just gotta be kidding me.</v>

203
00:10:19.070 --> 00:10:24.070
<v Speaker 4>They just make this shit up because they</v>
<v Speaker 4>know I'm so good at bringing my basic</v>

204
00:10:26.661 --> 00:10:30.410
<v Speaker 4>conservative agenda forward that they</v>
<v Speaker 4>have to go full,</v>

205
00:10:30.411 --> 00:10:35.411
<v Speaker 4>solid Lynskey and lie and lie and lie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if you go to Wikipedia to find out</v>

206
00:10:37.701 --> 00:10:41.030
<v Speaker 4>about Ted Nugent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they will repeat these lies.</v>

207
00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:43.790
<v Speaker 4>They're lies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Every one of those things.</v>

208
00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:46.030
<v Speaker 4>Every one of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If I had done and I go,</v>

209
00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:47.390
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was awesome,</v>

210
00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:48.680
<v Speaker 4>but I didn't do any of those things.</v>

211
00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:51.200
<v Speaker 4>Anyone can edit wikipedia,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know that right in the balls.</v>

212
00:10:51.290 --> 00:10:53.700
<v Speaker 4>Very strange that she might have edited</v>
<v Speaker 4>it yet.</v>

213
00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:56.000
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I'm glad we got that.</v>

214
00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:57.820
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this thing is just persisted forever.</v>

215
00:10:58.010 --> 00:11:00.170
<v Speaker 4>Obviously it stuck in your crop because</v>
<v Speaker 4>you wanted to bring it up,</v>

216
00:11:00.171 --> 00:11:02.000
<v Speaker 4>but the very end,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't stick in my crotch.</v>

217
00:11:02.001 --> 00:11:04.220
<v Speaker 4>Just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a fascinating example of the</v>

218
00:11:04.221 --> 00:11:08.150
<v Speaker 4>dishonesty and the anti journalism</v>
<v Speaker 4>agenda driven,</v>

219
00:11:08.510 --> 00:11:12.440
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>anti American anti Ted Anti Second</v>

220
00:11:12.441 --> 00:11:15.630
<v Speaker 4>Amendment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>anti freedom buffoonery the exist.</v>

221
00:11:15.830 --> 00:11:18.380
<v Speaker 4>I think it makes for an interesting</v>
<v Speaker 4>podcast exchange.</v>

222
00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:20.090
<v Speaker 4>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not in my craw.</v>

223
00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:22.520
<v Speaker 4>It's not even in my universe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I notice it.</v>

224
00:11:22.610 --> 00:11:27.610
<v Speaker 4>It's hysterical.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
