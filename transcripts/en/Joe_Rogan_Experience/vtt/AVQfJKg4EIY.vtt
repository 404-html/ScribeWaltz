<v Speaker 1>Goodly Moodley Jamie.</v>

2
00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.210
<v Speaker 1>We're all hopped up on adderall here at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3
00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:15.150
<v Speaker 1>at the Rogan studio with Tj supplied</v>
<v Speaker 1>some adderall.</v>

4
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.210
<v Speaker 1>He came here from Columbus and they just</v>
<v Speaker 1>give it to you at the airport.</v>

5
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:18.961
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6
00:00:18.961 --> 00:00:21.580
<v Speaker 1>they're handing out little samples.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

8
00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:28.680
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine if we did come up with a drug</v>

9
00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.820
<v Speaker 1>that had adderall like effects but no</v>
<v Speaker 1>negative consequences.</v>

10
00:00:32.821 --> 00:00:35.520
<v Speaker 1>In fact health benefits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I don't know.</v>

11
00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:38.520
<v Speaker 1>Some people are prescribed adderall so</v>
<v Speaker 1>for some people you know,</v>

12
00:00:38.521 --> 00:00:41.310
<v Speaker 1>apparently they just think all right for</v>
<v Speaker 1>you this is good.</v>

13
00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.031
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh No,</v>

14
00:00:42.031 --> 00:00:42.510
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

15
00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.030
<v Speaker 1>Does she just let people decide that for</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves and they just,</v>

16
00:00:45.031 --> 00:00:48.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let everyone try adderall and they keep</v>

17
00:00:48.571 --> 00:00:49.560
<v Speaker 1>taking it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they don't,</v>

18
00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.030
<v Speaker 1>they stopped taking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

19
00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.540
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't agree more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean some people obviously benefits</v>

20
00:00:54.541 --> 00:00:56.190
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They should be able to get it whenever</v>

21
00:00:56.191 --> 00:00:56.580
<v Speaker 1>they want.</v>

22
00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:57.750
<v Speaker 1>They shouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have the,</v>

23
00:00:57.751 --> 00:00:59.310
<v Speaker 1>they should have to go to a doctor about</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

24
00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:01.050
<v Speaker 1>How about that?</v>

<v Speaker 1>in my favor.</v>

51
00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.080

<v Speaker 1>get sick to my stomach.</v>

59
00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:34.950
<v Speaker 1>I had that problem for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I grew up in a cab that's always rough.</v>

60
00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.070
<v Speaker 1>Throw up in a cab,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like halfway opening the door to</v>

61
00:02:38.071 --> 00:02:39.360
<v Speaker 1>wherever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lucky enough to puke.</v>

62
00:02:39.361 --> 00:02:42.450
<v Speaker 1>I always just piss myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that better?</v>

63
00:02:42.451 --> 00:02:45.360
<v Speaker 1>I think that's better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's my pis that's not freaking me out.</v>

64
00:02:45.361 --> 00:02:46.160
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

65
00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.480
<v Speaker 1>I'd rather know if you puke and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

66
00:02:48.481 --> 00:02:51.210
<v Speaker 1>oh God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then afterwards you're like,</v>

67
00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.841
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

68
00:02:51.841 --> 00:02:56.010
<v Speaker 1>I feel I feel kind of better now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't feel good about waking up with</v>

69
00:02:56.011 --> 00:02:58.620
<v Speaker 1>your pants covered in Piss,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially because by that time you're</v>

70
00:02:58.621 --> 00:03:01.090
<v Speaker 1>almost sober again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You do have a point,</v>

71
00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:02.800
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you've got to look down and like,</v>

72
00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:05.170
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a grown man.</v>

73
00:03:05.171 --> 00:03:07.690

<v Speaker 1>too much.</v>

74
00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:09.610
<v Speaker 1>Depends on how you look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

75
00:03:09.611 --> 00:03:11.230
<v Speaker 1>I feel like a grown man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It throws up.</v>

76
00:03:11.231 --> 00:03:13.230
<v Speaker 1>Its more of a pitch to the guy who piss</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>

77
00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.760
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well then I guess I'm less of a bitch.</v>

78
00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:18.560

<v Speaker 1>All right dude.</v>

80
00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.660
<v Speaker 1>Throw up is a contagious pisses and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think that's part of the problem with</v>

81
00:03:28.661 --> 00:03:30.400
<v Speaker 1>throw up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you smelled throw up,</v>

82
00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:35.130
<v Speaker 1>you're like immediately you smell it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to start throwing.</v>

83
00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:37.090
<v Speaker 1>You never smell someone else's pissed</v>
<v Speaker 1>and be like,</v>

84
00:03:37.091 --> 00:03:41.210
<v Speaker 1>I gotta take a piss now you imagine if</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what it was like if somebody</v>

85
00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:42.850
<v Speaker 1>farted and like Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kinda Shit.</v>

86
00:03:42.851 --> 00:03:46.600
<v Speaker 1>How and when it was contagious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

87
00:03:46.601 --> 00:03:49.090
<v Speaker 1>Like oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean burst.</v>

<v Speaker 1>why isn't?</v>

90
00:03:52.451 --> 00:03:54.630
<v Speaker 1>And if you smell diarrhea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>

93
00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:01.780
<v Speaker 1>I guess diarrhea is evolutionarily,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you,</v>

94
00:04:01.781 --> 00:04:04.120
<v Speaker 1>if you throw up the rest of the people</v>
<v Speaker 1>around like,</v>

95
00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:04.920

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:13.120

<v Speaker 1>It's really interesting because uh,</v>

99
00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.580
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I became immune to it for a long time</v>

100
00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.920
<v Speaker 1>because I was around Puke so much on</v>
<v Speaker 1>fear factor.</v>

<v Speaker 1>it's back now.</v>

102
00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.740
<v Speaker 1>A little freak out over puke now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if I'm passing through a restaurant</v>

103
00:04:23.741 --> 00:04:25.900
<v Speaker 1>and someone through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw someone throw up recently in</v>

104
00:04:25.901 --> 00:04:26.900
<v Speaker 1>Vegas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

105

<v Speaker 1>oh boy.</v>

106
00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:32.980

110
00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:47.230

<v Speaker 1>and be in the fucking idiot that he is.</v>

111
00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:52.320
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't puke in the toilet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He pukes in the sink and it fills the</v>

112
00:04:52.331 --> 00:04:55.630
<v Speaker 1>sink to the brim,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the brim with fucking puke.</v>

<v Speaker 1>my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>that administer colonics and they start</v>

118
00:05:13.241 --> 00:05:15.850
<v Speaker 1>telling you what you're reading by</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at your shit as it goes through</v>

119
00:05:15.851 --> 00:05:18.640
<v Speaker 1>a tube in front of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about those wacky folk?</v>

120
00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:22.120
<v Speaker 1>I have no experience with that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I've never done it either,</v>

121
00:05:22.121 --> 00:05:24.790
<v Speaker 1>but everyone that I know that's done it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like first of all,</v>

122
00:05:24.791 --> 00:05:26.140
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you're necessarily</v>

123
00:05:26.141 --> 00:05:30.100
<v Speaker 1>supposed to do it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like if you eat fiber,</v>

124
00:05:30.101 --> 00:05:31.870
<v Speaker 1>it cleans everything out from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>inside.</v>

125
00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:34.270
<v Speaker 1>That's probably better than blowing</v>
<v Speaker 1>water up there.</v>

126
00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:37.660
<v Speaker 1>I'll probably gonna get a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 1>tweets from people that love Kalanick.</v>

127
00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:38.441
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

128
00:05:38.441 --> 00:05:39.490
<v Speaker 1>everyone's got their little health.</v>

129
00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:42.460
<v Speaker 1>Craziest shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people think that they can poke</v>

130
00:05:42.461 --> 00:05:46.090
<v Speaker 1>needles in themselves and hit certain</v>
<v Speaker 1>parts of their foot.</v>

131
00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.830
<v Speaker 1>And you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever seen that reflexology?</v>

132
00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:50.740
<v Speaker 1>Like psychology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's bizarre stuff,</v>

133
00:05:50.741 --> 00:05:52.930
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like pulling your toes to fix my</v>

134
00:05:52.931 --> 00:05:55.060
<v Speaker 1>shoulder hurts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me work on your foot.</v>

135
00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:56.893
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

136
00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:59.820
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure people believe it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't.</v>

137
00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:03.110
<v Speaker 1>It seems unlikely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

138
00:06:03.111 --> 00:06:06.500
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know anything more research</v>

139
00:06:06.501 --> 00:06:10.160
<v Speaker 1>needed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've talked shit about acupuncture,</v>

140
00:06:10.161 --> 00:06:14.990
<v Speaker 1>but apparently people use it works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people use all kinds of things and</v>

141
00:06:14.991 --> 00:06:15.920
<v Speaker 1>say they work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

142
00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:17.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

143
00:06:17.061 --> 00:06:19.250
<v Speaker 1>There's no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think there's actual evidence</v>

144
00:06:19.251 --> 00:06:22.820
<v Speaker 1>about acupuncture and made some sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>a peer reviewed journal about hey,</v>

145
00:06:22.821 --> 00:06:24.140
<v Speaker 1>if there is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm open to it,</v>

146
00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.930
<v Speaker 1>but I'm pretty sure it was pointed out</v>
<v Speaker 1>to me,</v>

147
00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:31.430
<v Speaker 1>the mind a little hazy right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's definitely been times when I've</v>

148
00:06:31.431 --> 00:06:34.130
<v Speaker 1>said Shit on a show or in a video and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I'll be like,</v>

149
00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:37.010
<v Speaker 1>I am fucking certain about this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I get a bunch of messages.</v>

150
00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:38.840
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these fucking idiots trying to prove me</v>

151
00:06:38.841 --> 00:06:41.240
<v Speaker 1>wrong and I look at their perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

152
00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:42.740
<v Speaker 1>Oh shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess I was wrong.</v>

153
00:06:42.741 --> 00:06:45.530
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in six months I'll just act like I never</v>

154
00:06:45.531 --> 00:06:47.690
<v Speaker 1>believed that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

155
00:06:47.691 --> 00:06:50.570
<v Speaker 1>do you change your mind though because</v>
<v Speaker 1>of people correcting me?</v>

156
00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:52.640
<v Speaker 1>I'd definitely do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to have to.</v>

157
00:06:52.641 --> 00:06:55.520
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to be some close minded</v>
<v Speaker 1>idiot that just believes the same thing</v>

158
00:06:55.521 --> 00:06:56.630
<v Speaker 1>no matter what.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

159
00:06:56.631 --> 00:07:00.500
<v Speaker 1>and people love you to be beholden to</v>
<v Speaker 1>your earliest beliefs,</v>

160
00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:04.370
<v Speaker 1>like if you had an idea a long time ago</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was wrong.</v>

161
00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:07.850
<v Speaker 1>Like if he said something I one of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>youtube videos and it turned and you</v>

162
00:07:07.851 --> 00:07:09.570
<v Speaker 1>were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a fucking fact,</v>

163
00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:12.880
<v Speaker 1>and then it turns out to not be a fact</v>
<v Speaker 1>and yeah,</v>

164
00:07:12.881 --> 00:07:15.680
<v Speaker 1>you're not allowed to make a mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just immortalized forever in</v>

165
00:07:15.681 --> 00:07:17.160
<v Speaker 1>history like this time.</v>

166
00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:20.630
<v Speaker 1>What about the time you said that it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>like maybe I think differently now</v>

167
00:07:20.631 --> 00:07:23.930
<v Speaker 1>because years and years of time and</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience of pass.</v>

168
00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:25.370
<v Speaker 1>Well you know what happened with dumb</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

169
00:07:25.371 --> 00:07:30.371
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately the term flip flopper got</v>
<v Speaker 1>out and what a flip flopper is,</v>

170
00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:32.420
<v Speaker 1>is someone who changes their fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>mind,</v>

171
00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:36.290
<v Speaker 1>which means you're a normal person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea that you're going to be a</v>

172
00:07:36.291 --> 00:07:40.610
<v Speaker 1>president or a congressman or senator</v>
<v Speaker 1>and never changed your mind once you</v>

173
00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:43.880
<v Speaker 1>establish this esteemed position,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once you're in there,</v>

174
00:07:43.881 --> 00:07:47.330
<v Speaker 1>you get elected,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got rock solid ideas about how the</v>

175
00:07:47.331 --> 00:07:51.620
<v Speaker 1>world works and you're so enlightened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You no longer need to learn or correct</v>

176
00:07:51.621 --> 00:07:53.900
<v Speaker 1>your ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's ridiculous.</v>

177
00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:57.740
<v Speaker 1>But to dummies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now they have that term.</v>

178
00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:00.200
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a flip flopper fucking tj.</v>

179
00:08:00.201 --> 00:08:05.201
<v Speaker 1>The flip video from seven years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all those life experiences before that,</v>

180
00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:09.530
<v Speaker 1>that fucking dude was saying this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a flip flopper.</v>

181
00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:12.710
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if they're just that consistent</v>
<v Speaker 1>in their lives.</v>

182
00:08:12.711 --> 00:08:14.210
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just want to find something to fuck</v>

183
00:08:14.211 --> 00:08:16.310
<v Speaker 1>with you on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just trying to poke,</v>

184
00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:17.810
<v Speaker 1>poke out horse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

185
00:08:17.811 --> 00:08:20.510
<v Speaker 1>that's like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the nature of life,</v>

186
00:08:20.511 --> 00:08:21.170
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

187
00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:23.880
<v Speaker 1>on the internet or in any sort of public</v>
<v Speaker 1>lens,</v>

188
00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:25.610
<v Speaker 1>even in the wild,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

189
00:08:25.611 --> 00:08:28.610
<v Speaker 1>it's natural you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you find a guy like you,</v>

190
00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:31.310
<v Speaker 1>you puts out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you put up these very interesting</v>

191
00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:35.510
<v Speaker 1>thought provoking videos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have strong opinions and you</v>

192
00:08:35.511 --> 00:08:38.750
<v Speaker 1>broadcast them out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's gonna be a bunch of</v>

193
00:08:38.751 --> 00:08:40.970
<v Speaker 1>people that respond to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people really enjoy them,</v>

194
00:08:40.971 --> 00:08:44.520
<v Speaker 1>some people get really mad at you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but because your stuff is good and that</v>

<v Speaker 1>you get a lot of attention.</v>

196
00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:49.390
<v Speaker 1>And when you get a lot of attention,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people go,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I heard that shit.</v>

200
00:08:56.031 --> 00:08:59.040
<v Speaker 1>He said about all you have to do is put</v>
<v Speaker 1>it in context of lake.</v>

201
00:08:59.041 --> 00:09:00.870
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if you find like,</v>

202
00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:04.290
<v Speaker 1>you know Christopher hitchens or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like the most eloquent fucking</v>

<v Speaker 1>guy you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's still gonna be people that fat.</v>

<v Speaker 1>What happened when he doctored?</v>

206
00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:09.991
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>

207
00:09:09.991 --> 00:09:12.750
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's in hell now he's burning.</v>

208
00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:14.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because he's a misogynist.</v>

209
00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:15.990
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that's the truth.</v>

210
00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:16.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's that,</v>

211
00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:19.410
<v Speaker 1>that little bit of revisionism too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forgot about that.</v>

212
00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:20.730
<v Speaker 1>The data was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

213
00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:23.270
<v Speaker 1>an interesting one that people chose to</v>
<v Speaker 1>attack because it was like,</v>

214
00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:26.790
<v Speaker 1>it was so white nighty that it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like blinding.</v>

215
00:09:26.791 --> 00:09:28.710
<v Speaker 1>Like you had to put sunglasses on to</v>
<v Speaker 1>read the tweets,</v>

216
00:09:28.711 --> 00:09:29.960
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

217
00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:35.460
<v Speaker 1>Christopher hitchens was a massage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know what he was a debater.</v>

218
00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:38.580
<v Speaker 1>He loved to debate people on anything</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he knew that a very thought</v>

219
00:09:38.581 --> 00:09:42.660
<v Speaker 1>provoking subject was the idea that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>only way women are funny is if they act</v>

220
00:09:42.661 --> 00:09:45.450
<v Speaker 1>like men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so he wrote that Vanity Fair article</v>

221
00:09:45.451 --> 00:09:47.580
<v Speaker 1>and he's a fucking genius.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trolls.</v>

222
00:09:47.581 --> 00:09:48.300
<v Speaker 1>What he is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

223
00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:52.440
<v Speaker 1>he's batting around a mouse and so we</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to remember too,</v>

224
00:09:52.441 --> 00:09:55.050
<v Speaker 1>is this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bar for massaging is so low.</v>

225
00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:57.840
<v Speaker 1>I mean like better that I've made videos</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

226
00:09:58.250 --> 00:09:59.200
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's just,</v>

227
00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:03.290
<v Speaker 1>I believe in equality between men and</v>
<v Speaker 1>women legally and all.</v>

228
00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:04.320
<v Speaker 1>Always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

229
00:10:04.321 --> 00:10:06.390
<v Speaker 1>every opportunity man has a woman should</v>
<v Speaker 1>have.</v>

230
00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:08.190
<v Speaker 1>Let's just get that out of the way right</v>
<v Speaker 1>off the bat.</v>

231
00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:12.860
<v Speaker 1>But I think this wage gap thing is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little wonky massage.</v>

232
00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:15.210
<v Speaker 1>I just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

233
00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:16.470
<v Speaker 1>instantly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

234
00:10:16.471 --> 00:10:19.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I sat there and I explained to you that</v>

235
00:10:19.351 --> 00:10:22.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have a fucking point of contention on</v>

236
00:10:22.231 --> 00:10:23.970
<v Speaker 1>an,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on an issue of economics that doesn't</v>

237
00:10:23.971 --> 00:10:25.500
<v Speaker 1>make me a fucking misogynist.</v>

238
00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:30.980
<v Speaker 1>The wage gap thing is a really weird one</v>
<v Speaker 1>because people just don't want to talk</v>

239
00:10:31.381 --> 00:10:32.610
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

240
00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:33.511
<v Speaker 1>when you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

241
00:10:33.511 --> 00:10:35.970
<v Speaker 1>this wage gap thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way it's been explained to me is a</v>

242
00:10:35.971 --> 00:10:40.080
<v Speaker 1>bunch of different jobs that people</v>
<v Speaker 1>pursue and the jobs that men pursue tend</v>

243
00:10:40.081 --> 00:10:43.230
<v Speaker 1>to be higher paying jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also higher risk jobs.</v>

244
00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:47.370
<v Speaker 1>More men die while they're employed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They die on the seven percent.</v>

245
00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:51.580
<v Speaker 1>Some crazy number is really high,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you taught,</v>

246
00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:52.140
<v Speaker 1>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

247
00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:54.090
<v Speaker 1>if you even go into that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't.</v>

248
00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:56.520
<v Speaker 1>Those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are problematic pieces of</v>

249
00:10:56.521 --> 00:10:59.790
<v Speaker 1>information because just the fact that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they exist at all,</v>

250
00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:03.690
<v Speaker 1>you're attacking them like it becomes</v>
<v Speaker 1>this really weird thing where you're</v>

251
00:11:03.691 --> 00:11:05.700
<v Speaker 1>not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not supposed to talk about the</v>

252
00:11:05.701 --> 00:11:09.390
<v Speaker 1>actual facts of what is happening in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>workplace.</v>

253
00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:12.900
<v Speaker 1>So the actual numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Forget about the fact that we know</v>

254
00:11:12.901 --> 00:11:15.570
<v Speaker 1>there's white bosses who were racist.</v>

255
00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:18.750
<v Speaker 1>We know there's men who are bosses who</v>
<v Speaker 1>were sexist.</v>

256
00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:21.660
<v Speaker 1>We know there are women who are bosses</v>
<v Speaker 1>who hate the other women in the office</v>

257
00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:24.390
<v Speaker 1>and you fucked them over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know people are getting fucked over</v>

258
00:11:24.391 --> 00:11:26.940
<v Speaker 1>left and right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know and I think you could put it</v>

259
00:11:26.941 --> 00:11:29.100
<v Speaker 1>into a good people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bad people thing.</v>

260
00:11:29.130 --> 00:11:30.720
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's really what you're dealing</v>
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>

261
00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:33.360
<v Speaker 1>You can call it man or women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can call it whatever the fuck you</v>

262
00:11:33.361 --> 00:11:35.880
<v Speaker 1>want to call it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's good people and bad people and</v>

263
00:11:35.881 --> 00:11:38.060
<v Speaker 1>that's you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As soon as you pick a side,</v>

264
00:11:38.061 --> 00:11:41.880
<v Speaker 1>it's only gender based and any</v>
<v Speaker 1>information whatsoever is unacceptable</v>

265
00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:43.760
<v Speaker 1>and that's why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why I don't like the,</v>

266
00:11:43.761 --> 00:11:48.420
<v Speaker 1>the Mras and the snake towels and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like all you're doing is inverting</v>

267
00:11:48.421 --> 00:11:50.490
<v Speaker 1>the whole victim complex thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're just saying,</v>

268
00:11:50.491 --> 00:11:52.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get after them for saying we're the</v>

269
00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:54.160
<v Speaker 1>give us special</v>

270
00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:55.990
<v Speaker 2>privileges,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're just trying to flip the</v>

271
00:11:55.991 --> 00:11:58.780
<v Speaker 2>script and do the same thing from the</v>
<v Speaker 2>other end is the only place they have a</v>

272
00:11:58.781 --> 00:12:02.590
<v Speaker 2>point is financially I may have some.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they have some points in a child</v>

273
00:12:02.591 --> 00:12:06.700
<v Speaker 2>custody and stuff like that too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I mean as far as like saying that</v>

274
00:12:06.701 --> 00:12:08.140
<v Speaker 2>they're victims.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

275
00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:13.630
<v Speaker 2>As far as like really establishing this</v>
<v Speaker 2>idea that for whatever reason it's okay</v>

276
00:12:13.631 --> 00:12:16.180
<v Speaker 2>for a guy to get fucked over in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship.</v>

277
00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:20.710
<v Speaker 2>To the point where he loses everything</v>
<v Speaker 2>just because these two people don't want</v>

278
00:12:20.711 --> 00:12:24.250
<v Speaker 2>to be together anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That that's been firmly established.</v>

279
00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:28.620
<v Speaker 2>That's not part of like a systematic</v>
<v Speaker 2>society wide impression of man,</v>

280
00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:30.650
<v Speaker 2>not just an issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a legal issue.</v>

281
00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:31.061
<v Speaker 2>It's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

282
00:12:31.061 --> 00:12:33.070
<v Speaker 2>And it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it can be taken seriously on its own.</v>

283
00:12:33.250 --> 00:12:35.020
<v Speaker 2>You don't need an ideology to address</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

284
00:12:35.021 --> 00:12:36.730
<v Speaker 2>Just like you don't need feminism to</v>
<v Speaker 2>address,</v>

285
00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:38.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>problems that women have,</v>

286
00:12:38.381 --> 00:12:43.360
<v Speaker 2>which I'm sure there are plenty of</v>
<v Speaker 2>feminist grievances that are well</v>

287
00:12:43.361 --> 00:12:44.830
<v Speaker 2>founded,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well thought out and shit,</v>

288
00:12:44.831 --> 00:12:47.470
<v Speaker 2>but I mean they're drown out by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

289
00:12:47.530 --> 00:12:50.580
<v Speaker 2>the tits and video games are too big or</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're too small.</v>

290
00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:52.690
<v Speaker 2>Like there's a famous example of this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

291
00:12:52.691 --> 00:12:53.950
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anita Sarkeesian,</v>

292
00:12:54.490 --> 00:12:57.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was complaining about the old Tomb</v>

293
00:12:57.640 --> 00:13:00.400
<v Speaker 2>Raider Games because Lara Croft tits</v>
<v Speaker 2>were too big.</v>

294
00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.040
<v Speaker 2>And then they made them smaller.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then she said,</v>

295
00:13:03.041 --> 00:13:06.010
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well look how they're defeminized Lara</v>

296
00:13:06.010 --> 00:13:08.410
<v Speaker 2>Croft to make her look more like a man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just,</v>

297
00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:10.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just proves that she's an unpleasable</v>

298
00:13:10.871 --> 00:13:12.070
<v Speaker 2>can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No matter what you do,</v>

299
00:13:12.730 --> 00:13:15.400
<v Speaker 2>I'm just going to find fault.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's gonna find a fucking problem.</v>

300
00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:19.570
<v Speaker 2>There's going to be people that whatever</v>
<v Speaker 2>hot button issue,</v>

301
00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:21.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially when it comes to gender,</v>

302
00:13:21.810 --> 00:13:25.210
<v Speaker 2>gender is a real hot button issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'd be crates like almost instant</v>

303
00:13:25.211 --> 00:13:26.290
<v Speaker 2>argument.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why.</v>

304
00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:28.180
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why is it?</v>

305
00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:30.450
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's gotta be a reason there.</v>

306
00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:30.901
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

307
00:13:30.901 --> 00:13:31.990
<v Speaker 2>There has to be a reason,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't.</v>

308
00:13:31.991 --> 00:13:34.060
<v Speaker 2>I don't really get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I guess it's maybe just the</v>

309
00:13:34.061 --> 00:13:36.790
<v Speaker 2>history of that inequalities have</v>
<v Speaker 2>existed,</v>

310
00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:39.280
<v Speaker 2>but I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

311
00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:43.090
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why people still have such</v>
<v Speaker 2>a hair trigger reaction on the gender</v>

312
00:13:43.091 --> 00:13:46.150
<v Speaker 2>thing or why it's so important because</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what's weighted?</v>

313
00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:48.370
<v Speaker 2>It's weighted by the actions of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>past.</v>

314
00:13:48.371 --> 00:13:50.860
<v Speaker 2>You can't look at it as a thing that</v>
<v Speaker 2>exists in the present.</v>

315
00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:54.310
<v Speaker 2>I mean even the current,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're a person who is being</v>

316
00:13:54.340 --> 00:13:56.890
<v Speaker 2>victimized,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if you're a girl is being sexually</v>

317
00:13:56.891 --> 00:13:58.480
<v Speaker 2>harassed by a boss or something like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

318
00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:02.200
<v Speaker 2>It exists in the present or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fill in the blank with sexual</v>

319
00:14:02.201 --> 00:14:04.420
<v Speaker 2>harassment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not you and it's not me and</v>

320
00:14:04.421 --> 00:14:07.210
<v Speaker 2>we're not doing what I have in these</v>
<v Speaker 2>conversations about the wage gap when I</v>

321
00:14:07.211 --> 00:14:08.560
<v Speaker 2>was working,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was a teenager,</v>

322
00:14:08.561 --> 00:14:11.470
<v Speaker 2>I was working in my dad's office and</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a woman there and she was</v>

323
00:14:11.471 --> 00:14:15.550
<v Speaker 2>perfectly attractive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she would make very strong like,</v>

324
00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:17.860
<v Speaker 2>come on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's to me,</v>

325
00:14:17.861 --> 00:14:20.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she'd be like grabbing my ass and shit</v>

326
00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:21.820
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

327
00:14:21.821 --> 00:14:23.920
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't interested,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

328
00:14:23.921 --> 00:14:25.510
<v Speaker 2>it's like when I wasn't interested,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

329
00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:26.373
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

330
00:14:26.650 --> 00:14:30.490
<v Speaker 2>we think Tj is gay or something because</v>
<v Speaker 2>he didn't want that.</v>

331
00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.090
<v Speaker 2>So I mean it's one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least for women,</v>

332
00:14:34.091 --> 00:14:38.020
<v Speaker 2>there's that mechanism there of like</v>
<v Speaker 2>society kind of has something built in</v>

333
00:14:38.021 --> 00:14:40.390
<v Speaker 2>to believe you if you're a victim of</v>
<v Speaker 2>sexual harassment.</v>

334
00:14:40.391 --> 00:14:42.250
<v Speaker 2>But for me it was like there was nowhere</v>
<v Speaker 2>to turn.</v>

335
00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:44.320
<v Speaker 2>Did you feel like a victim?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

336
00:14:44.321 --> 00:14:47.110
<v Speaker 2>I didn't feel like a victim because I</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't like to foster the victim</v>

337
00:14:47.111 --> 00:14:48.640
<v Speaker 2>mentality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I certainly felt like there was an</v>

338
00:14:48.641 --> 00:14:51.470
<v Speaker 2>issue going on in my life that I had no</v>
<v Speaker 2>ability to address.</v>

339
00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:54.110
<v Speaker 1>Was she above you in the office?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

340
00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:54.861
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

341
00:14:54.861 --> 00:14:56.480
<v Speaker 1>So that makes it weird too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

342
00:14:56.481 --> 00:14:57.291
<v Speaker 1>she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

343
00:14:57.291 --> 00:15:01.110
<v Speaker 1>the manager of all the people in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>call center because we'll call sand.</v>

344
00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.530
<v Speaker 1>She was just a crazy lady you want and</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much fun in the office and she was.</v>

345
00:15:06.050 --> 00:15:06.860
<v Speaker 1>She was pulling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

346
00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:08.450
<v Speaker 1>she was grabbing my ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

347
00:15:08.451 --> 00:15:09.284
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want,</v>

348
00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:11.150
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I was into it,</v>

349
00:15:11.151 --> 00:15:11.811
<v Speaker 1>cool,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

350
00:15:11.811 --> 00:15:13.280
<v Speaker 1>if I reciprocated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

351
00:15:13.281 --> 00:15:15.620
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've got a fun office now.</v>

352
00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:17.250
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you imagine what would have</v>

353
00:15:17.251 --> 00:15:19.130
<v Speaker 1>happened when it became obvious that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't like it.</v>

354
00:15:19.131 --> 00:15:20.330
<v Speaker 1>It's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

355
00:15:20.450 --> 00:15:21.420
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

356
00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:23.000
<v Speaker 1>Why are you going to keep doing this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>

357
00:15:23.001 --> 00:15:26.030
<v Speaker 1>So she kept doing it like it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a persistent pattern,</v>

358
00:15:26.031 --> 00:15:26.990
<v Speaker 1>just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

359
00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:28.310
<v Speaker 1>day after day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

360
00:15:28.311 --> 00:15:29.720
<v Speaker 1>probably three or four months.</v>

361
00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:33.050
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So every day you would go to work and</v>

362
00:15:33.051 --> 00:15:33.890
<v Speaker 1>you'd be thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

363
00:15:33.891 --> 00:15:37.400
<v Speaker 1>this crazy lady's going to grab my ass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I just didn't like her.</v>

364
00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:39.110
<v Speaker 1>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

365
00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:42.080
<v Speaker 1>That's not cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not cool for us.</v>

366
00:15:42.390 --> 00:15:44.680
<v Speaker 1>I was so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was so passive than to.</v>

367
00:15:44.681 --> 00:15:47.150
<v Speaker 1>I mean I really didn't know how to say</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

368
00:15:47.151 --> 00:15:48.680
<v Speaker 1>I got to assert yourself because you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

369
00:15:48.681 --> 00:15:51.890
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't very assertive at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a hard spot.</v>

370
00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:54.800
<v Speaker 1>That's a hard spot for a human being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

371
00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:57.530
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a real problem when</v>

372
00:15:58.190 --> 00:16:02.420
<v Speaker 1>people don't want to look at you as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy who's in a hard spot because you are</v>

373
00:16:02.421 --> 00:16:03.380
<v Speaker 1>a male,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

374
00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:06.860
<v Speaker 1>Whereas if you were a woman and you were</v>
<v Speaker 1>in that same position at the same age</v>

375
00:16:06.861 --> 00:16:10.190
<v Speaker 1>and the same awkwardness at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would feel really bad for you.</v>

376
00:16:10.191 --> 00:16:11.480
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck man,</v>

377
00:16:11.630 --> 00:16:14.650
<v Speaker 1>what an asshole that guy is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or what an asshole that woman is.</v>

378
00:16:14.650 --> 00:16:17.270
<v Speaker 1>If the woman was grabbing her ass and</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was freaking out,</v>

379
00:16:17.271 --> 00:16:20.780
<v Speaker 1>it'd be the same kind of reaction have</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you had a young girl who worked in</v>

380
00:16:20.781 --> 00:16:24.170
<v Speaker 1>the office and was a little awkward and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was this like super aggressive</v>

381
00:16:24.171 --> 00:16:28.010
<v Speaker 1>woman who kept grabbing her ass all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time and freaking out and it was a woman</v>

382
00:16:28.011 --> 00:16:31.070
<v Speaker 1>who was above or in the office.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be a really creepy scene,</v>

383
00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:33.320
<v Speaker 1>but you don't get much sympathy for your</v>
<v Speaker 1>store.</v>

384
00:16:33.350 --> 00:16:34.490
<v Speaker 1>Why would I?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

385
00:16:34.930 --> 00:16:38.270
<v Speaker 1>Because there's no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no social mechanism that says</v>

386
00:16:38.271 --> 00:16:39.680
<v Speaker 1>that's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

387
00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:40.820
<v Speaker 1>It just looks like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

388
00:16:40.821 --> 00:16:41.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just some funny,</v>

389
00:16:41.811 --> 00:16:43.460
<v Speaker 1>isolated thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

390
00:16:43.970 --> 00:16:45.980
<v Speaker 1>when I've told that story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had other people come forward and</v>

391
00:16:45.981 --> 00:16:46.581
<v Speaker 1>say like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

392
00:16:46.581 --> 00:16:48.440
<v Speaker 1>I had that problem too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I just didn't know what to do about</v>

393
00:16:48.441 --> 00:16:49.910
<v Speaker 1>it because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're a man,</v>

394
00:16:49.911 --> 00:16:54.470
<v Speaker 1>you can't say I was sexually harassed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know it just because you're not</v>

395
00:16:54.471 --> 00:16:58.610
<v Speaker 1>interested in a particular woman who</v>
<v Speaker 1>seems to have way too much interest in</v>

396
00:16:58.611 --> 00:16:58.820
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

397
00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:01.460
<v Speaker 1>That's not reciprocated on your part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

398
00:17:01.461 --> 00:17:02.660
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

399
00:17:03.290 --> 00:17:05.330
<v Speaker 1>that's a weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A blind spot,</v>

400
00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:08.420
<v Speaker 1>we have what I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're a man,</v>

401
00:17:08.421 --> 00:17:11.150
<v Speaker 1>you're supposed to deal with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's across the board.</v>

402
00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:14.090
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not just men that say that women</v>

403
00:17:14.091 --> 00:17:17.360
<v Speaker 1>say that to across the board,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you're a man you're just supposed</v>

404
00:17:17.361 --> 00:17:19.270
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's one of my larger point is</v>

405
00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:21.830
<v Speaker 1>that when it comes to these like</v>
<v Speaker 1>feminist and gender issues,</v>

406
00:17:21.831 --> 00:17:26.120
<v Speaker 1>it's like we're supposed to always</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe that there's a gender root cause</v>

407
00:17:26.121 --> 00:17:28.730
<v Speaker 1>to what's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can't just be that one person is</v>

408
00:17:28.731 --> 00:17:32.420
<v Speaker 1>horny for another person that doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>want that person back,</v>

409
00:17:32.930 --> 00:17:35.010
<v Speaker 1>which can happen to anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

410
00:17:36.250 --> 00:17:40.010
<v Speaker 1>There's too many variables with people</v>
<v Speaker 1>to take a side based entirely on gender.</v>

411
00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:44.480
<v Speaker 1>There's just too many variables.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Variables are a form of mysogeny there.</v>

412
00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:48.410
<v Speaker 1>There are trigger warnings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>variables or trigger warnings and unto</v>

413
00:17:48.411 --> 00:17:50.060
<v Speaker 1>themselves I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think</v>

414
00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:51.150
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

415
00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:54.510
<v Speaker 3>we kind of addressed human beings as</v>
<v Speaker 3>individuals,</v>

416
00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:57.240
<v Speaker 3>as human beings being male,</v>
<v Speaker 3>female,</v>

417
00:17:57.241 --> 00:17:57.901
<v Speaker 3>gay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>straight.</v>

418
00:17:57.901 --> 00:18:00.330
<v Speaker 3>Who gives a shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's get on a team.</v>

419
00:18:00.331 --> 00:18:02.400
<v Speaker 3>I try to do it too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we all try to do it.</v>

420
00:18:02.550 --> 00:18:06.510
<v Speaker 3>It's difficult when it's not being done</v>
<v Speaker 3>like universally all around us.</v>

421
00:18:07.050 --> 00:18:09.360
<v Speaker 3>When I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a true story.</v>

422
00:18:09.570 --> 00:18:12.750
<v Speaker 3>When I moved from San Francisco to</v>
<v Speaker 3>Florida,</v>

423
00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:15.210
<v Speaker 3>I was 11 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

424
00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:19.080
<v Speaker 3>I was 11 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We moved to Florida and I didn't know</v>

425
00:18:19.081 --> 00:18:20.850
<v Speaker 3>what the word nigger meant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know.</v>

426
00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:23.490
<v Speaker 3>I had no idea what it meant because I</v>
<v Speaker 3>lived in San Francisco.</v>

427
00:18:23.550 --> 00:18:26.580
<v Speaker 3>San Francisco is super diverse in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>seventies.</v>

428
00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:30.450
<v Speaker 3>This was like the Vietnam War ended when</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was in San Francisco,</v>

429
00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:35.780
<v Speaker 3>so this was like hippies and fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>people with bell bottoms and like my</v>

430
00:18:36.601 --> 00:18:39.720
<v Speaker 3>stepdad would get whistled at her when</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was with me.</v>

431
00:18:40.150 --> 00:18:44.490
<v Speaker 3>It was like crazy how weird people were.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like a real freaky place to be</v>

432
00:18:44.491 --> 00:18:46.860
<v Speaker 3>like a young kid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but no racism.</v>

433
00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:49.080
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>none of that fucking never heard those</v>

434
00:18:49.081 --> 00:18:52.710
<v Speaker 3>words at school.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So then I go to Florida and I heard it</v>

435
00:18:52.711 --> 00:18:55.020
<v Speaker 3>like first day someone's calling</v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody a nigger.</v>

436
00:18:55.021 --> 00:18:56.520
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck is that?</v>

437
00:18:56.760 --> 00:19:00.930
<v Speaker 3>So I didn't want to say I didn't know</v>
<v Speaker 3>because then I would look like a loser.</v>

438
00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:04.410
<v Speaker 3>So I had to go home and I asked my mom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she got pissed and maybe she thought I</v>

439
00:19:04.411 --> 00:19:05.550
<v Speaker 3>was playing a game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's like,</v>

440
00:19:05.551 --> 00:19:07.020
<v Speaker 3>you're trying to get me to say it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

441
00:19:07.021 --> 00:19:08.220
<v Speaker 3>I'm not trying to get you to say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like,</v>

442
00:19:08.250 --> 00:19:09.870
<v Speaker 3>what does it mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was,</v>

443
00:19:09.871 --> 00:19:10.980
<v Speaker 3>you don't know what it means.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

444
00:19:11.130 --> 00:19:13.350
<v Speaker 3>you gotTa fucking tell me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like 11 years old.</v>

445
00:19:13.351 --> 00:19:14.280
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck does it mean?</v>

446
00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:18.180
<v Speaker 3>And so she had explained to me that it</v>
<v Speaker 3>was a derogatory term for black people.</v>

447
00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:19.620
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

448
00:19:20.490 --> 00:19:21.570
<v Speaker 3>Like at 11,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

449
00:19:21.571 --> 00:19:22.380
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What,</v>

450
00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:24.630
<v Speaker 3>what real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those are real.</v>

451
00:19:24.631 --> 00:19:27.030
<v Speaker 3>Like I couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't imagine it at that time.</v>

452
00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:32.360
<v Speaker 3>So it is possible to grow up in a place</v>
<v Speaker 3>like maybe it was just the area that I</v>

453
00:19:32.581 --> 00:19:37.050
<v Speaker 3>was when I was young,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we could somehow or another promote</v>

454
00:19:37.051 --> 00:19:41.730
<v Speaker 3>that sort of universal look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't make you immune to doing</v>

455
00:19:41.731 --> 00:19:45.360
<v Speaker 3>something stupid because you're gay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't make you immune to being an</v>

456
00:19:45.361 --> 00:19:48.990
<v Speaker 3>asshole because you're a chick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't make you immune to whatever.</v>

457
00:19:48.991 --> 00:19:52.470
<v Speaker 3>I mean fill in the blank gender wise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just people as individuals.</v>

458
00:19:53.130 --> 00:19:55.140
<v Speaker 3>That's why I like star Trek.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Am I running for office?</v>

459
00:19:55.890 --> 00:19:59.070
<v Speaker 3>That's why you like star Trek Star Trek</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you're not enough diversity.</v>

460
00:19:59.071 --> 00:20:01.260
<v Speaker 3>A lot of men run a white men running,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

461
00:20:01.261 --> 00:20:03.780
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of diversity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially compared to,</v>

462
00:20:03.781 --> 00:20:05.370
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the shows on at the time.</v>

463
00:20:05.370 --> 00:20:07.950
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first interracial kiss on star Trek,</v>

464
00:20:08.010 --> 00:20:10.200
<v Speaker 3>one of the first lesbian kisses on star</v>
<v Speaker 3>Trek.</v>

465
00:20:10.890 --> 00:20:11.671
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

466
00:20:11.671 --> 00:20:13.470
<v Speaker 3>not the original series,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but on deep space nine.</v>

467
00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:15.070
<v Speaker 3>I don't count those as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did.</v>

468
00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:17.520
<v Speaker 3>Those aren't star track.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just stole the name,</v>

469
00:20:17.521 --> 00:20:19.080
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't even like the original series.</v>

470
00:20:20.090 --> 00:20:21.780
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sorry.</v>

471
00:20:21.781 --> 00:20:23.370
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just don't.</v>

472
00:20:23.371 --> 00:20:24.660
<v Speaker 3>It's too cheesy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's too corny.</v>

473
00:20:24.930 --> 00:20:27.240
<v Speaker 3>Goodness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a time capsule though,</v>

474
00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:28.350
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

475
00:20:28.610 --> 00:20:29.820
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's definitely cheesy.</v>

476
00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:32.040
<v Speaker 3>A cheesy time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Best forgotten.</v>

477
00:20:32.070 --> 00:20:33.480
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's become a comedy.</v>

478
00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:36.170
<v Speaker 3>It's a comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't intended it as the time.</v>

479
00:20:36.180 --> 00:20:37.380
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was not.</v>

480
00:20:37.381 --> 00:20:39.840
<v Speaker 3>But if you watch it today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it truly is a comedy,</v>

481
00:20:39.841 --> 00:20:42.030
<v Speaker 3>especially if there's any aliens</v>
<v Speaker 3>involved.</v>

482
00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:45.960
<v Speaker 3>Like when Kirk Kirk had to duke it out</v>
<v Speaker 3>with that one dude with the lizard head.</v>

483
00:20:45.990 --> 00:20:47.230
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so slow.</v>

484
00:20:50.290 --> 00:20:54.580
<v Speaker 1>It was a fake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was so fake looking like sped up the</v>

485
00:20:54.581 --> 00:20:56.980
<v Speaker 1>film or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At least they should have made it in the</v>

486
00:20:56.981 --> 00:20:58.000
<v Speaker 1>dark.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

487
00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:00.040
<v Speaker 1>the plan should have been total</v>
<v Speaker 1>darkness.</v>

488
00:21:00.041 --> 00:21:02.670
<v Speaker 1>So the monster was like very hard to see</v>
<v Speaker 1>because see,</v>

489
00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:04.210
<v Speaker 1>when you look at all of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

490
00:21:04.211 --> 00:21:07.510
<v Speaker 1>what is this piece of shit you're trying</v>
<v Speaker 1>to tell me as an alien?</v>

491
00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:13.870
<v Speaker 1>But my point about star trek was though</v>
<v Speaker 1>they never really talk about that kind</v>

492
00:21:13.871 --> 00:21:14.830
<v Speaker 1>of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like,</v>

493
00:21:14.831 --> 00:21:16.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there's a black character,</v>

494
00:21:16.301 --> 00:21:19.720
<v Speaker 1>there's no issue dealing with their</v>
<v Speaker 1>blackness,</v>

495
00:21:19.721 --> 00:21:22.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all been moved past.</v>

496
00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:24.130
<v Speaker 1>Look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

497
00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:26.950
<v Speaker 1>is this real?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

498
00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:28.480
<v Speaker 1>Come on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come on.</v>

499
00:21:28.481 --> 00:21:30.760
<v Speaker 1>This is real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>

500
00:21:31.030 --> 00:21:33.100
<v Speaker 1>this is so hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

501
00:21:33.101 --> 00:21:35.800
<v Speaker 1>Kirk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a Shitty Moy Thai terrible</v>

502
00:21:35.801 --> 00:21:38.410
<v Speaker 1>technique doesn't turn his hip over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No weight to that.</v>

503
00:21:40.090 --> 00:21:41.260
<v Speaker 1>So this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

504
00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:44.500
<v Speaker 1>is it playing with sound too?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

505
00:21:44.710 --> 00:21:46.870
<v Speaker 1>So what we're looking at for people</v>
<v Speaker 1>listening to this.</v>

506
00:21:46.871 --> 00:21:48.730
<v Speaker 1>So I'm so sorry I haven't been</v>
<v Speaker 1>describing this.</v>

507
00:21:49.030 --> 00:21:54.030
<v Speaker 1>Is Captain Kirk Duking it out with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>shittiest fucking fake looking green</v>

508
00:21:54.401 --> 00:21:58.240
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alien on this planet,</v>

509
00:21:58.241 --> 00:22:01.480
<v Speaker 1>it was like one of the cheesiest scenes</v>
<v Speaker 1>in all of Star Trek.</v>

510
00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:05.860
<v Speaker 1>It's just so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kirk boxes is yours to get free.</v>

511
00:22:05.861 --> 00:22:08.200
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's everything's bad about it.</v>

512
00:22:08.230 --> 00:22:11.230
<v Speaker 1>The acting is bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The movement is bad.</v>

513
00:22:11.350 --> 00:22:16.120
<v Speaker 1>Like they're moving in slow motion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when he's trying to throw punches</v>

514
00:22:16.121 --> 00:22:18.340
<v Speaker 1>at the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now Kirk is coming out with a rock.</v>

515
00:22:19.030 --> 00:22:21.000
<v Speaker 1>Oh Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got a rock and he's.</v>

516
00:22:21.290 --> 00:22:24.160
<v Speaker 1>There's a closeup as he lifts it over</v>
<v Speaker 1>his head and throws it and he hits him</v>

517
00:22:24.370 --> 00:22:27.070
<v Speaker 1>right in the chest and guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It does nothing.</v>

518
00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:28.570
<v Speaker 1>It just bounces off of a curse.</v>

519
00:22:28.570 --> 00:22:30.490
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like do,</v>

520
00:22:30.491 --> 00:22:32.830
<v Speaker 1>just start walking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That fucking thing is never going to</v>

521
00:22:32.831 --> 00:22:35.500
<v Speaker 1>catch you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is the slowest piece of shit of all</v>

522
00:22:35.501 --> 00:22:36.071
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

523
00:22:36.071 --> 00:22:40.570
<v Speaker 1>Just stroll away leisurely and it walks</v>
<v Speaker 1>up to a big rock and that was going to</v>

524
00:22:40.571 --> 00:22:43.990
<v Speaker 1>pick up the big rock look like that</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking piece of shit.</v>

525
00:22:43.991 --> 00:22:48.220
<v Speaker 1>Fake rock is good Lord.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this lizard thing that literally it's</v>

526
00:22:48.221 --> 00:22:50.860
<v Speaker 1>expression does not move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a child's toy.</v>

527
00:22:51.250 --> 00:22:54.760
<v Speaker 1>It throws this rock at Kirk and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>barely gets out of the way.</v>

528
00:22:54.970 --> 00:22:56.250
<v Speaker 1>A little too casual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are correct.</v>

529
00:22:56.251 --> 00:22:59.140
<v Speaker 1>If that was a real fucking rock,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd be shitting your pants,</v>

530
00:22:59.141 --> 00:23:01.600
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That rock was within six inches of</v>

531
00:23:01.601 --> 00:23:03.970
<v Speaker 1>hitting him and tearing his arm off his</v>
<v Speaker 1>body.</v>

532
00:23:05.110 --> 00:23:06.790
<v Speaker 1>Fucking goofy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>

533
00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:10.550
<v Speaker 1>It's too cheesy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hate when people are right,</v>

534
00:23:12.430 --> 00:23:13.151
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least.</v>

535
00:23:13.151 --> 00:23:14.530
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some cheesy moments.</v>

536
00:23:14.531 --> 00:23:16.180
<v Speaker 1>I'm like the next generation or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

537
00:23:16.181 --> 00:23:17.050
<v Speaker 1>but there's nothing like that.</v>

538
00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:19.780
<v Speaker 1>I never got into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never got into it because there was</v>

539
00:23:19.781 --> 00:23:24.160
<v Speaker 1>this guy named Kevin Knox who is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>hilarious comedian in Boston and he had</v>

540
00:23:24.161 --> 00:23:26.530
<v Speaker 1>this ruthless bit about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

541
00:23:26.531 --> 00:23:28.540
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck did they do to the Old</v>
<v Speaker 1>Star Trek?</v>

542
00:23:28.541 --> 00:23:30.850
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who's this fucking new captain?</v>

543
00:23:30.851 --> 00:23:32.650
<v Speaker 1>Go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's this new bald guy is new captain.</v>

544
00:23:32.651 --> 00:23:36.140
<v Speaker 1>He was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would do this long rant about like</v>

545
00:23:36.190 --> 00:23:39.250
<v Speaker 1>how great captain Kirk was and how much</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy sucks.</v>

546
00:23:39.251 --> 00:23:42.820
<v Speaker 1>And out of respect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never watched the uh,</v>

547
00:23:43.230 --> 00:23:45.800
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now at least I can.</v>

548
00:23:45.860 --> 00:23:48.980
<v Speaker 1>At least I can understand the reasoning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a little logic to it.</v>

549
00:23:49.010 --> 00:23:51.830
<v Speaker 1>Very little,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's amazing how bad special effects</v>

550
00:23:51.831 --> 00:23:53.840
<v Speaker 1>were just a few decades ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

551
00:23:53.841 --> 00:23:55.850
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was a,</v>

552
00:23:55.940 --> 00:23:57.710
<v Speaker 1>that could have been done better even in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the time,</v>

553
00:23:57.890 --> 00:24:00.140
<v Speaker 1>like you said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean like shooting in the dark,</v>

554
00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:01.850
<v Speaker 1>speed it up a little,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

555
00:24:02.270 --> 00:24:06.950
<v Speaker 1>Well that was done in what the sixties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seventies and it was probably either 66</v>

556
00:24:06.951 --> 00:24:08.930
<v Speaker 1>or 67 were like late sixties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

557
00:24:09.060 --> 00:24:12.230
<v Speaker 1>I mean you think about the great move,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the hustler with Paul Newman and</v>

558
00:24:12.231 --> 00:24:14.420
<v Speaker 1>Jackie gleason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was just a few years before that.</v>

559
00:24:14.450 --> 00:24:16.160
<v Speaker 1>That is a great move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they were doing great.</v>

560
00:24:16.410 --> 00:24:17.600
<v Speaker 1>We saw that last year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

561
00:24:18.170 --> 00:24:19.430
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

562
00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:22.670
<v Speaker 1>That's great movie man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jackie gleason was a fucking hell of an</v>

563
00:24:22.671 --> 00:24:25.010
<v Speaker 1>actor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really interesting to see his,</v>

564
00:24:25.070 --> 00:24:27.890
<v Speaker 1>his career got so weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he did so many different things</v>

565
00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:32.210
<v Speaker 1>going from like the honeymooners to like</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing a serious role,</v>

566
00:24:32.211 --> 00:24:37.040
<v Speaker 1>like the hustler where he wasn't funny</v>
<v Speaker 1>at all to doing smokey and the bandit,</v>

567
00:24:37.190 --> 00:24:39.950
<v Speaker 1>which is like so slapsticky and</v>
<v Speaker 1>hilarious.</v>

568
00:24:40.150 --> 00:24:42.260
<v Speaker 1>Smokey and the bandit holds up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It does.</v>

569
00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:43.790
<v Speaker 1>It holds up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

570
00:24:43.791 --> 00:24:45.710
<v Speaker 1>My first girlfriend showed me that</v>
<v Speaker 1>movie.</v>

571
00:24:46.730 --> 00:24:48.230
<v Speaker 1>I found it weird because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

572
00:24:48.231 --> 00:24:51.320
<v Speaker 1>I've never really thought of sally</v>
<v Speaker 1>fields is very sexual,</v>

573
00:24:51.321 --> 00:24:52.660
<v Speaker 1>but in that movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

574
00:24:52.670 --> 00:24:54.380
<v Speaker 1>I didn't like her ass.</v>

575
00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:57.580
<v Speaker 1>It was very big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember that good.</v>

576
00:24:57.980 --> 00:25:00.890
<v Speaker 1>She's a sweetheart.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was like pretty like pretty much had</v>

<v Speaker 1>bad thing.</v>

596
00:25:56.601 --> 00:25:59.150
<v Speaker 1>It's probably a bad thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I used to date a girl who wrote</v>

<v Speaker 2>And</v>

693

<v Speaker 1>I mean it's like identity politics gone</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking bat shit.</v>

00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:26.780
<v Speaker 1>What are their preferred gender</v>
<v Speaker 1>pronouns?</v>

763
00:33:27.210 --> 00:33:29.180
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if they have specific</v>

764
00:33:29.540 --> 00:33:33.440
<v Speaker 1>pronouns for the each other kin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but most of them do tend to like,</v>

765
00:33:33.490 --> 00:33:36.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the CSI kind of shit.</v>

766
00:33:36.260 --> 00:33:40.040
<v Speaker 1>I was on some websites that I was just</v>
<v Speaker 1>scrolling around looking for</v>

767
00:33:40.041 --> 00:33:41.840
<v Speaker 1>information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking for new stories.</v>

768
00:33:42.230 --> 00:33:47.230
<v Speaker 1>And I saw a story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was on dig about how William</v>

769
00:33:47.390 --> 00:33:52.390
<v Speaker 1>Shakespeare used the pronoun they for an</v>
<v Speaker 1>individual and now it's coming back.</v>

770
00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:55.310
<v Speaker 1>You're talking about gender neutral</v>
<v Speaker 1>pronouns.</v>

771
00:33:55.311 --> 00:33:59.750
<v Speaker 1>Like William Shakespeare used it because</v>
<v Speaker 1>they talked goofy back then they had</v>

772
00:33:59.751 --> 00:34:02.840
<v Speaker 1>just invented England.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a bunch of shitty ways of</v>

773
00:34:02.841 --> 00:34:04.760
<v Speaker 1>describing things that we don't do</v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

774
00:34:04.910 --> 00:34:06.530
<v Speaker 1>Thou far out now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

775
00:34:06.540 --> 00:34:08.630
<v Speaker 1>there's a bunch of stupid ways they</v>
<v Speaker 1>talked.</v>

776
00:34:08.631 --> 00:34:09.464
<v Speaker 1>We realized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

777
00:34:09.530 --> 00:34:12.830
<v Speaker 1>this is a lot of extra sounds we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>making with our face and it's not</v>

778
00:34:12.831 --> 00:34:14.960
<v Speaker 1>getting the point across any better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just dumb.</v>

779
00:34:15.170 --> 00:34:17.880
<v Speaker 1>So let's cut the shit and let's clean</v>
<v Speaker 1>this fucking bitch out.</v>

780
00:34:18.350 --> 00:34:22.550
<v Speaker 1>Modern English is the best English.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like they got the age gender people</v>

781
00:34:22.551 --> 00:34:26.200
<v Speaker 1>that they want everyone to say they</v>
<v Speaker 1>until they.</v>

782
00:34:26.270 --> 00:34:27.920
<v Speaker 1>Until they tell you their preferred</v>
<v Speaker 1>pronoun.</v>

783
00:34:27.921 --> 00:34:30.080
<v Speaker 1>Exactly mean like you're fucking a</v>
<v Speaker 1>plural.</v>

<v Speaker 1>When there isn't a single is when you</v>

785
00:34:31.431 --> 00:34:32.960
<v Speaker 1>say they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is where I draw the line.</v>

786
00:34:32.961 --> 00:34:34.640
<v Speaker 1>You want to call yourself z.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who goes why?</v>

<v Speaker 1>But they would you like teaching people</v>

789
00:34:40.911 --> 00:34:44.330
<v Speaker 1>the difference is singular and plural.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Plural is they?</v>

790
00:34:44.420 --> 00:34:45.920
<v Speaker 1>That's a bunch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a few people.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's not a fucking guy.</v>

00:34:48.830 --> 00:34:49.551
<v Speaker 1>Would you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

00:34:49.551 --> 00:34:50.900
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll meet them at the store.</v>

794
00:34:51.020 --> 00:34:52.550
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you meet them at the store.</v>

795
00:34:52.640 --> 00:34:56.000

<v Speaker 1>What the fuck did you just say?</v>

798
00:34:59.541 --> 00:35:02.630
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you say even assuming though</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we started using all of these</v>

799
00:35:02.631 --> 00:35:04.580
<v Speaker 1>gender pronouns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Howard,</v>

800
00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:05.990
<v Speaker 1>how is anyone even going to keep that</v>
<v Speaker 1>straight?</v>

801
00:35:05.991 --> 00:35:10.850
<v Speaker 1>Like assume it catches on like wildfire</v>
<v Speaker 1>and everyone gets to choose from a list</v>

802
00:35:10.851 --> 00:35:14.630
<v Speaker 1>of like 297 genders with their own</v>
<v Speaker 1>unique sets of pronouns.</v>

803
00:35:14.930 --> 00:35:19.010
<v Speaker 1>Like I can't even remember his pe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember people's fucking names.</v>

804
00:35:19.011 --> 00:35:21.650
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to remember that many</v>

805
00:35:21.651 --> 00:35:24.980
<v Speaker 1>different sets of pronouns for people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

806
00:35:25.090 --> 00:35:28.100
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think people try really fucking hard</v>

807
00:35:28.130 --> 00:35:31.190
<v Speaker 1>to define themselves because in some</v>
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>

808
00:35:31.220 --> 00:35:34.610
<v Speaker 1>shape or form,</v>
<v Speaker 1>defining yourself helps you feel like</v>

809
00:35:34.611 --> 00:35:36.950
<v Speaker 1>you have at least a little bit of</v>
<v Speaker 1>sovereignty.</v>

810
00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:38.640
<v Speaker 1>This madness</v>

811
00:35:38.670 --> 00:35:42.330
<v Speaker 3>that we're all trudging through.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's the most interesting</v>

812
00:35:42.331 --> 00:35:45.570
<v Speaker 3>thing about you is that you use some</v>
<v Speaker 3>weird pronouns then you're not very</v>

813
00:35:45.571 --> 00:35:46.830
<v Speaker 3>fucking interests.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's true.</v>

814
00:35:46.890 --> 00:35:49.320
<v Speaker 3>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But to those people,</v>

815
00:35:49.330 --> 00:35:52.500
<v Speaker 3>it like one of the reasons why they</v>
<v Speaker 3>fight for it so viciously.</v>

816
00:35:52.740 --> 00:35:55.770
<v Speaker 3>I think for a lot of like really</v>
<v Speaker 3>disenfranchised people,</v>

817
00:35:56.100 --> 00:36:01.100
<v Speaker 3>they feel so outside of any little</v>
<v Speaker 3>victory they can get even in coming up</v>

818
00:36:02.821 --> 00:36:05.600
<v Speaker 3>with a new gender pronoun that makes</v>
<v Speaker 3>them somehow another field.</v>

819
00:36:05.610 --> 00:36:08.520
<v Speaker 3>But it's not a victory though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it is for them.</v>

820
00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:10.620
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it's like a little tiny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

821
00:36:10.621 --> 00:36:11.310
<v Speaker 3>it's not like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

822
00:36:11.310 --> 00:36:14.580
<v Speaker 3>like you're not winning the war.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you win a tiny little personal</v>

823
00:36:14.581 --> 00:36:15.271
<v Speaker 3>battle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess.</v>

824
00:36:15.271 --> 00:36:15.691
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

825
00:36:15.691 --> 00:36:16.560
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're in other can,</v>

826
00:36:16.561 --> 00:36:18.420
<v Speaker 3>every,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every person that gets to tell you that</v>

827
00:36:18.421 --> 00:36:19.860
<v Speaker 3>you're a dragon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

828
00:36:19.861 --> 00:36:21.000
<v Speaker 3>that's just another.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

829
00:36:21.001 --> 00:36:21.834
<v Speaker 3>I'm a dragon.</v>

830
00:36:22.110 --> 00:36:24.570
<v Speaker 3>But say I'm a dragon and agree I'm a</v>
<v Speaker 3>dragon.</v>

831
00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:28.260
<v Speaker 3>The more true it becomes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think other kin is a very extreme</v>

832
00:36:28.261 --> 00:36:30.510
<v Speaker 3>example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that extreme example.</v>

833
00:36:30.511 --> 00:36:31.940
<v Speaker 3>But I'm not into,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

834
00:36:31.970 --> 00:36:34.410
<v Speaker 3>even like all the alternative gender</v>
<v Speaker 3>pronouns,</v>

835
00:36:34.411 --> 00:36:36.180
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm cool with transgender people.</v>

836
00:36:36.181 --> 00:36:37.380
<v Speaker 3>I'm cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>

837
00:36:38.010 --> 00:36:41.430
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's not 200 genders there just isn't</v>

838
00:36:41.700 --> 00:36:42.570
<v Speaker 3>going to go to that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want,</v>

839
00:36:42.580 --> 00:36:46.530
<v Speaker 3>I want to read this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is Jamie just put up 2015 word of</v>

840
00:36:46.531 --> 00:36:49.020
<v Speaker 3>the year is singular.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They says,</v>

841
00:36:49.021 --> 00:36:52.410
<v Speaker 3>fucking who you can have a word of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>year,</v>

842
00:36:52.411 --> 00:36:54.930
<v Speaker 3>asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If there's a reason why there's millions</v>

843
00:36:54.931 --> 00:36:58.740
<v Speaker 3>of words,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because words can only convey a portion</v>

844
00:36:58.741 --> 00:37:01.000
<v Speaker 3>of an idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They string them together and form</v>

845
00:37:01.090 --> 00:37:03.450
<v Speaker 3>sentences.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't get to have a fucking word of</v>

846
00:37:03.451 --> 00:37:06.780
<v Speaker 3>the year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That stupid shit that's really fucking</v>

847
00:37:06.781 --> 00:37:08.870
<v Speaker 3>dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe the word of the year should be as</v>

848
00:37:08.910 --> 00:37:13.200
<v Speaker 3>dumb as using the word gay as a singular</v>
<v Speaker 3>person because that's not what it is.</v>

849
00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:14.640
<v Speaker 3>You fucks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

850
00:37:14.700 --> 00:37:18.150
<v Speaker 3>God Damn it chose pissed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>God dammit.</v>

851
00:37:18.540 --> 00:37:21.870
<v Speaker 3>Look if because it's unnecessary to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why would she have a singular?</v>

852
00:37:21.871 --> 00:37:25.200
<v Speaker 3>They tell me Your fucking name.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it pat?</v>

853
00:37:25.410 --> 00:37:26.161
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pat,</v>

854
00:37:26.161 --> 00:37:28.170
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you're a guy or girl.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't give a fuck.</v>

855
00:37:28.290 --> 00:37:32.220
<v Speaker 3>I know I can call you pat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They fuck you.</v>

856
00:37:32.430 --> 00:37:36.300
<v Speaker 3>Fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just fuck you.</v>

857
00:37:36.301 --> 00:37:38.190
<v Speaker 3>You're asking for too much goddamn</v>
<v Speaker 3>attention.</v>

858
00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:41.430
<v Speaker 3>Stop it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't.</v>

859
00:37:41.431 --> 00:37:42.830
<v Speaker 3>You think?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think America.</v>

860
00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:45.960
<v Speaker 3>I speak for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If Donald Trump speaks for most America,</v>

861
00:37:46.110 --> 00:37:48.930
<v Speaker 3>I speak for everybody else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

862
00:37:48.931 --> 00:37:50.460
<v Speaker 3>He might agree on the whole day thing</v>
<v Speaker 3>though.</v>

863
00:37:51.330 --> 00:37:53.410
<v Speaker 3>You guys could probably find common</v>
<v Speaker 3>ground where,</v>

864
00:37:53.710 --> 00:37:56.280
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'd probably find speak you speak for</v>

865
00:37:56.281 --> 00:37:59.580
<v Speaker 3>all of America there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we need Donald Trump,</v>

866
00:37:59.610 --> 00:38:02.670
<v Speaker 3>but we need Donald Trump on mushrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what we need.</v>

867
00:38:02.671 --> 00:38:05.790
<v Speaker 3>We need a Donald Trump that has a bunch</v>
<v Speaker 3>of psychedelic experiences and just</v>

868
00:38:05.791 --> 00:38:09.660
<v Speaker 3>releases all this fucking aggressive</v>
<v Speaker 3>bullshit and realizes like he's in this</v>

869
00:38:09.661 --> 00:38:12.480
<v Speaker 3>unique position to maybe link</v>
<v Speaker 3>legitimately changed the world.</v>

870
00:38:12.630 --> 00:38:14.700
<v Speaker 3>Can't believe you found mushrooms when</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's 65,</v>

871
00:38:14.820 --> 00:38:17.730
<v Speaker 3>but now that he did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he knows he's got to do something about</v>

872
00:38:17.731 --> 00:38:19.860
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So give them shrooms and like a spear</v>

873
00:38:19.861 --> 00:38:21.690
<v Speaker 3>and set him loose in the woods.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

874
00:38:21.691 --> 00:38:24.210
<v Speaker 3>you know what happens is Donald Trump</v>
<v Speaker 3>has a science advisor.</v>

875
00:38:24.211 --> 00:38:28.230
<v Speaker 3>This trying to keep him alive and this</v>
<v Speaker 3>an science advisor informs him of the</v>

876
00:38:28.231 --> 00:38:33.231
<v Speaker 3>longevity properties of relaxation and</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is bound up 10 step thing.</v>

877
00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:37.810
<v Speaker 3>One Way to cure this pattern or behavior</v>
<v Speaker 3>may be a breakthrough psychedelic</v>

878
00:38:37.811 --> 00:38:40.300
<v Speaker 3>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they convinced Mr. Trump to go to</v>

879
00:38:40.301 --> 00:38:44.650
<v Speaker 3>like Cedar Sinai or someplace it looks</v>
<v Speaker 3>legit and they bring them into a room</v>

880
00:38:44.651 --> 00:38:49.390
<v Speaker 3>and they dose the fuck out of him with</v>
<v Speaker 3>like 10 grams of mushrooms from Mexico.</v>

881
00:38:49.630 --> 00:38:52.380
<v Speaker 3>Just</v>
<v Speaker 3>the mothership,</v>

882
00:38:52.540 --> 00:38:55.750
<v Speaker 3>hieroglyphs aliens communicating with</v>
<v Speaker 3>long,</v>

883
00:38:55.751 --> 00:39:00.751
<v Speaker 3>stretchy fingers that go right to his</v>
<v Speaker 3>soul and rearrange his synapses and he</v>

884
00:39:01.001 --> 00:39:04.030
<v Speaker 3>comes out of that two hours later,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a completely different cat.</v>

885
00:39:04.390 --> 00:39:06.460
<v Speaker 3>Then we got a real fucking presidential</v>
<v Speaker 3>candidate.</v>

886
00:39:06.940 --> 00:39:09.130
<v Speaker 3>Then we got somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But right now we've got Bernie Sanders</v>

887
00:39:09.131 --> 00:39:12.440
<v Speaker 3>and Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think Donald Trump's gonna Fuckin.</v>

888
00:39:12.550 --> 00:39:14.920
<v Speaker 3>When you think he's going to win,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

889
00:39:15.490 --> 00:39:16.450
<v Speaker 3>This is what I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

890
00:39:16.451 --> 00:39:19.090
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is a legit question,</v>

891
00:39:19.091 --> 00:39:22.810
<v Speaker 3>how healthy Hillary Clinton is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there's been some questions about.</v>

892
00:39:22.811 --> 00:39:26.080
<v Speaker 3>Apparently she had had a concussion at</v>
<v Speaker 3>one point in time and she suffers</v>

893
00:39:26.081 --> 00:39:28.180
<v Speaker 3>postconcussion syndrome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe.</v>

894
00:39:28.300 --> 00:39:31.810
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's figuring out what's true and</v>

895
00:39:31.811 --> 00:39:34.060
<v Speaker 3>what's not because everything is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

896
00:39:34.110 --> 00:39:39.110
<v Speaker 3>It might be a rumor that you put a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was talking to your Jamie earlier</v>

897
00:39:40.090 --> 00:39:41.620
<v Speaker 3>about a mine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

898
00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:43.140
<v Speaker 3>he's yours,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my friend Jamie,</v>

899
00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:44.920
<v Speaker 3>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jamie.</v>

900
00:39:45.990 --> 00:39:48.310
<v Speaker 3>I didn't want to presume,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but anyway.</v>

901
00:39:48.330 --> 00:39:50.220
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was talking to him about.</v>

902
00:39:50.930 --> 00:39:52.270
<v Speaker 3>I was talking about how there's just</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

903
00:39:52.450 --> 00:39:55.990
<v Speaker 3>there's so much information now that</v>
<v Speaker 3>people can just kind of cherry pick</v>

904
00:39:55.991 --> 00:39:57.340
<v Speaker 3>whatever they want the truth to be.</v>

905
00:39:57.640 --> 00:39:58.421
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

906
00:39:58.421 --> 00:39:59.650
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

907
00:39:59.651 --> 00:40:02.260
<v Speaker 3>no matter what crazy shit you believe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can always find someone that's</v>

908
00:40:02.261 --> 00:40:04.540
<v Speaker 3>selling that narrative.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's true.</v>

909
00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:07.870
<v Speaker 3>Why not just go with them and say that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>the truth and everything else is a lie.</v>

910
00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:08.800
<v Speaker 3>That is true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

911
00:40:08.801 --> 00:40:12.130
<v Speaker 3>you can always find support.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's one of the more interesting</v>

912
00:40:12.131 --> 00:40:15.160
<v Speaker 3>things about online communication.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When they ask you something,</v>

913
00:40:15.161 --> 00:40:17.440
<v Speaker 3>what would you prefer between Hillary</v>
<v Speaker 3>and trump?</v>

914
00:40:18.070 --> 00:40:20.020
<v Speaker 3>That's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

915
00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:24.070
<v Speaker 3>I don't know them and it's all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like saying like,</v>

916
00:40:24.340 --> 00:40:27.880
<v Speaker 3>who would be the better mom?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Angela Lansbury or the mom from the</v>

917
00:40:27.881 --> 00:40:29.620
<v Speaker 3>Brady bunch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't fucking know those people.</v>

918
00:40:29.830 --> 00:40:30.910
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

919
00:40:31.060 --> 00:40:33.350
<v Speaker 3>Who would you rather have as your mom?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't fucking know.</v>

920
00:40:33.730 --> 00:40:36.340
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think what you get when you watch</v>

921
00:40:36.341 --> 00:40:39.010
<v Speaker 3>Hillary Clinton is a fucking polished</v>
<v Speaker 3>politician,</v>

922
00:40:39.220 --> 00:40:42.310
<v Speaker 3>a polished lawyer who became a</v>
<v Speaker 3>politician who was married to a</v>

923
00:40:42.311 --> 00:40:46.210
<v Speaker 3>president who's been secretary of state,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just group Frankenstein.</v>

924
00:40:46.300 --> 00:40:47.450
<v Speaker 3>She's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

925
00:40:47.620 --> 00:40:51.010
<v Speaker 3>she's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's a deep political person.</v>

926
00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:53.500
<v Speaker 3>She's deep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's deep in the system and in the</v>

927
00:40:53.501 --> 00:40:55.960
<v Speaker 3>game,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think we all can agree whether</v>

928
00:40:55.961 --> 00:41:00.010
<v Speaker 3>you're a republican or a Democrat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the game is fucking rigged.</v>

929
00:41:00.340 --> 00:41:03.490
<v Speaker 3>It's rigged.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's rigged in a bunch of real simple</v>

930
00:41:03.491 --> 00:41:05.950
<v Speaker 3>ways and a map,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a couple of them out real quick that</v>

931
00:41:05.951 --> 00:41:10.690
<v Speaker 3>everybody knows the have way too much</v>
<v Speaker 3>money that's being spent on these</v>

932
00:41:10.691 --> 00:41:13.690
<v Speaker 3>parties by gigantic corporations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Way Too much money,</v>

933
00:41:13.810 --> 00:41:16.150
<v Speaker 3>way too much influence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was way too much cronyism.</v>

934
00:41:16.151 --> 00:41:19.270
<v Speaker 3>There's way too many people to become</v>
<v Speaker 3>career politicians and they get</v>

935
00:41:19.271 --> 00:41:22.270
<v Speaker 3>intertwined and I rubbed my back or rub</v>
<v Speaker 3>your back.</v>

936
00:41:22.271 --> 00:41:25.170
<v Speaker 3>You Rub my back and they have these</v>
<v Speaker 3>weird fucking allegiances and then they</v>

937
00:41:25.171 --> 00:41:30.171
<v Speaker 3>have parties to very clear distinct</v>
<v Speaker 3>party of Republican or a Democrat and it</v>

938
00:41:30.641 --> 00:41:34.040
<v Speaker 3>would take a fucking meteor hitting</v>
<v Speaker 3>Virginia for them</v>

939
00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:35.780
<v Speaker 5>to elect an independent candidate.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

940
00:41:35.781 --> 00:41:39.680
<v Speaker 5>it was some radical fucked up life</v>
<v Speaker 5>changing event would have to happen on</v>

941
00:41:39.681 --> 00:41:44.120
<v Speaker 5>earth where people woke up out of the</v>
<v Speaker 5>fog and realize we have to try for an</v>

942
00:41:44.121 --> 00:41:46.820
<v Speaker 5>independent party but don't yet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But even what I was gonna say is the</v>

943
00:41:46.821 --> 00:41:49.130
<v Speaker 5>idea,</v>
<v Speaker 5>even if there's only three parties is</v>

944
00:41:49.131 --> 00:41:51.770
<v Speaker 5>fucking insane.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's insane.</v>

945
00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:55.850
<v Speaker 5>The idea that you have three choices and</v>
<v Speaker 5>two of them have proven to be inept at</v>

946
00:41:55.851 --> 00:41:59.150
<v Speaker 5>managing the country over and over and</v>
<v Speaker 5>over and over and over and over again.</v>

947
00:41:59.330 --> 00:42:04.330
<v Speaker 5>It's like having Walmart and like JC</v>
<v Speaker 5>Penney and they're both selling cancer</v>

948
00:42:04.461 --> 00:42:06.680
<v Speaker 5>sticks and everyone's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

949
00:42:06.681 --> 00:42:10.700
<v Speaker 5>art cancer sticks killed way less people</v>
<v Speaker 5>than their cancer sticks and then they</v>

950
00:42:10.730 --> 00:42:15.020
<v Speaker 5>trade off back and forth.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One shitty fucking fast food joint</v>

951
00:42:15.170 --> 00:42:20.170
<v Speaker 5>versus another Shitty fucking filling</v>
<v Speaker 5>the company Jackie fucking company</v>

952
00:42:20.780 --> 00:42:22.730
<v Speaker 5>that's selling you terrible shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what the republic.</v>

953
00:42:23.110 --> 00:42:25.720
<v Speaker 1>Don't you think it was at least kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting that we have,</v>

954
00:42:26.230 --> 00:42:29.290
<v Speaker 1>as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of the three people who stand a</v>

955
00:42:29.291 --> 00:42:29.861
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

956
00:42:29.861 --> 00:42:31.270
<v Speaker 1>I guess you could put crews in there</v>
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

957
00:42:31.510 --> 00:42:34.390
<v Speaker 1>You really don't think you as an</v>
<v Speaker 1>outlier.</v>

958
00:42:34.420 --> 00:42:38.160
<v Speaker 1>He's way too crazy as far as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the people who actually have a</v>

959
00:42:38.170 --> 00:42:39.430
<v Speaker 1>stand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a chance of being president,</v>

960
00:42:39.431 --> 00:42:40.121
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hillary,</v>

961
00:42:40.121 --> 00:42:41.980
<v Speaker 1>as we've said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is total establishment,</v>

962
00:42:41.981 --> 00:42:43.600
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Donald trump,</v>

963
00:42:43.601 --> 00:42:46.270
<v Speaker 1>he's really not taking money from</v>
<v Speaker 1>others.</v>

964
00:42:46.271 --> 00:42:49.240
<v Speaker 1>He's mostly just using his personal</v>
<v Speaker 1>fortune at this point,</v>

965
00:42:49.420 --> 00:42:52.210
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bernie Sanders is not taking money from</v>

966
00:42:52.211 --> 00:42:54.550
<v Speaker 1>super pacs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's just getting funded by,</v>

967
00:42:54.900 --> 00:42:57.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a private citizens and stuff.</v>

968
00:42:57.820 --> 00:43:01.000
<v Speaker 1>So to have these people who are so</v>
<v Speaker 1>popular or people who have largely</v>

969
00:43:01.001 --> 00:43:03.840
<v Speaker 1>issued this system of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

970
00:43:04.180 --> 00:43:06.730
<v Speaker 1>the moneyed interests,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pumping the,</v>

971
00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:09.370
<v Speaker 1>these political campaigns full of money</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then expecting,</v>

972
00:43:09.371 --> 00:43:10.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course their,</v>

973
00:43:11.020 --> 00:43:14.140
<v Speaker 1>their core values and return that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

974
00:43:14.170 --> 00:43:14.510
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

975
00:43:14.510 --> 00:43:16.960
<v Speaker 1>So it's kind of interesting that at</v>
<v Speaker 1>least we have two candidates that are</v>

976
00:43:16.961 --> 00:43:19.450
<v Speaker 1>not part of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a good point,</v>

977
00:43:19.451 --> 00:43:23.050
<v Speaker 1>or don't at least seem to be on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>surface that are,</v>

978
00:43:23.980 --> 00:43:26.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bernie Sanders have the second most</v>

979
00:43:26.561 --> 00:43:29.170
<v Speaker 1>popular Democrat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He stands a pretty decent chance of</v>

980
00:43:29.171 --> 00:43:31.510
<v Speaker 1>winning A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Donald Trump is the most popular</v>

981
00:43:31.511 --> 00:43:33.730
<v Speaker 1>republican.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He probably will get the nomination if</v>

982
00:43:33.731 --> 00:43:37.690
<v Speaker 1>Bernie Sanders just made a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 1>more sense about finances.</v>

983
00:43:37.691 --> 00:43:42.190
<v Speaker 1>I think I would be in his corner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just don't you like there's a bunch of</v>

984
00:43:42.191 --> 00:43:45.520
<v Speaker 1>things that I do like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me just say what I do like I like</v>

985
00:43:45.610 --> 00:43:50.610
<v Speaker 1>what he says about having these people</v>
<v Speaker 1>that pay taxes or that I'm shelter their</v>

986
00:43:51.581 --> 00:43:53.530
<v Speaker 1>money from taxes by putting them in</v>
<v Speaker 1>foreign banks.</v>

987
00:43:53.800 --> 00:43:55.870
<v Speaker 1>They should,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they should have to pay tax on those and</v>

988
00:43:55.871 --> 00:43:58.090
<v Speaker 1>that's bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's tax shelters that are set up for</v>

989
00:43:58.091 --> 00:44:01.160
<v Speaker 1>corporations where a corporation makes</v>
<v Speaker 1>billions of dollars and somehow or</v>

990
00:44:01.161 --> 00:44:02.350
<v Speaker 1>another they don't pay any taxes.</v>

991
00:44:02.440 --> 00:44:04.180
<v Speaker 1>That's insanity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That all should be fixed.</v>

992
00:44:04.240 --> 00:44:04.750
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

993
00:44:04.750 --> 00:44:06.280
<v Speaker 1>And I agree with him 100 percent on</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

994
00:44:06.640 --> 00:44:11.640
<v Speaker 1>I agree with him on a living wage and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had people argue with me about this</v>

995
00:44:11.890 --> 00:44:13.960
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say that I need to talk to an economist</v>

996
00:44:13.961 --> 00:44:18.370
<v Speaker 1>and maybe they're right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but ideologically maybe they're right</v>

997
00:44:18.371 --> 00:44:20.410
<v Speaker 1>financially,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but ideologically I think if somebody</v>

998
00:44:20.411 --> 00:44:22.630
<v Speaker 1>works for you 40 hours a week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they should be able to eat.</v>

999
00:44:22.990 --> 00:44:25.450
<v Speaker 1>They should be able to have a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an apartment to live in.</v>

1000
00:44:25.480 --> 00:44:28.580
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should pay someone a living wage.</v>

1001
00:44:28.581 --> 00:44:30.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a full time worker should definitely</v>

1002
00:44:30.281 --> 00:44:32.550
<v Speaker 1>have the ability to feed,</v>

1003
00:44:32.550 --> 00:44:36.600
<v Speaker 3>clothe and shelter themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's seems very reasonable.</v>

1004
00:44:36.660 --> 00:44:38.010
<v Speaker 3>It should be without debate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1005
00:44:38.060 --> 00:44:41.670
<v Speaker 3>I mean it should be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're talking about a person dedicating</v>

1006
00:44:41.700 --> 00:44:45.800
<v Speaker 3>eight hours of every day of their life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a giant chunk of money.</v>

1007
00:44:45.840 --> 00:44:46.800
<v Speaker 3>Whenever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whenever these,</v>

1008
00:44:46.801 --> 00:44:48.750
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>companies crunch the numbers like</v>

1009
00:44:48.751 --> 00:44:50.120
<v Speaker 3>Mcdonald's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they cry.</v>

1010
00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:55.160
<v Speaker 3>How much would we have to raise our</v>
<v Speaker 3>prices to raise our wages to $15 an</v>

1011
00:44:55.231 --> 00:44:57.030
<v Speaker 3>hour?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It'd be something like,</v>

1012
00:44:57.031 --> 00:44:59.640
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>five cents on every big Mac and shit</v>

1013
00:44:59.641 --> 00:45:00.431
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Real.</v>

1014
00:45:00.431 --> 00:45:01.980
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so insignificant.</v>

1015
00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:02.521
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>see,</v>

1016
00:45:02.521 --> 00:45:04.320
<v Speaker 3>that's just crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>

1017
00:45:04.321 --> 00:45:05.730
<v Speaker 3>They won't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

1018
00:45:05.820 --> 00:45:06.930
<v Speaker 3>furthermore,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've seen,</v>

1019
00:45:07.190 --> 00:45:07.580
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1020
00:45:07.580 --> 00:45:09.300
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're about to get a big experiment in</v>

1021
00:45:09.301 --> 00:45:11.790
<v Speaker 3>this in Seattle anyway because they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>raising the wages.</v>

1022
00:45:12.750 --> 00:45:15.420
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Seattle is also in the unique position</v>

1023
00:45:15.421 --> 00:45:20.421
<v Speaker 3>of being at a first year legal marijuana</v>
<v Speaker 3>sale and when that,</v>

1024
00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:25.290
<v Speaker 3>when the taxes came into Denver,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's twisting the whole economy</v>

1025
00:45:25.291 --> 00:45:26.460
<v Speaker 3>sideways there.</v>

1026
00:45:26.460 --> 00:45:28.800
<v Speaker 3>Real estate prices have gone through the</v>
<v Speaker 3>roof.</v>

1027
00:45:29.010 --> 00:45:33.690
<v Speaker 3>I think the real estate prices,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're closing in on like 16 percent or</v>

1028
00:45:33.691 --> 00:45:37.920
<v Speaker 3>more up from the previous year when</v>
<v Speaker 3>marijuana wasn't legal there.</v>

1029
00:45:38.210 --> 00:45:42.060
<v Speaker 3>They're violent crimes kind of way down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Drunk driving is that the lowest?</v>

1030
00:45:42.061 --> 00:45:45.570
<v Speaker 3>They've had it like 10 years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking crazy and they've made more</v>

1031
00:45:45.571 --> 00:45:49.740
<v Speaker 3>money in taxes just in the first year</v>
<v Speaker 3>than they did an alcohol.</v>

1032
00:45:50.190 --> 00:45:51.360
<v Speaker 3>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's insane.</v>

1033
00:45:51.390 --> 00:45:53.790
<v Speaker 3>More money from marijuana and that state</v>
<v Speaker 3>from alcohol.</v>

1034
00:45:53.940 --> 00:45:56.370
<v Speaker 3>You think about all the places that</v>
<v Speaker 3>serve alcohol.</v>

1035
00:45:56.460 --> 00:45:58.560
<v Speaker 3>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you think they should take that</v>

1036
00:45:58.561 --> 00:46:01.030
<v Speaker 3>approach to some of the other drugs that</v>
<v Speaker 3>are currently illegal set?</v>

1037
00:46:01.110 --> 00:46:03.250
<v Speaker 3>One hundred percent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially the ones that don't kill you,</v>

1038
00:46:04.120 --> 00:46:06.750
<v Speaker 3>all the ones that you make,</v>
<v Speaker 3>any exceptions or would it just across</v>

1039
00:46:06.751 --> 00:46:09.570
<v Speaker 3>the board the real problem is going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be children.</v>

1040
00:46:09.660 --> 00:46:11.520
<v Speaker 3>That's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a problem now.</v>

1041
00:46:11.550 --> 00:46:14.370
<v Speaker 3>It's the problem with prescription pills</v>
<v Speaker 3>that people leave around.</v>

1042
00:46:14.371 --> 00:46:19.080
<v Speaker 3>It's a problem with irresponsible folks</v>
<v Speaker 3>who leave around potentially dangerous</v>

1043
00:46:19.081 --> 00:46:23.430
<v Speaker 3>things like a prescription medication or</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a bag of mushrooms or coke or</v>

1044
00:46:23.431 --> 00:46:24.480
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1045
00:46:24.481 --> 00:46:25.650
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's going to be a problem,</v>

1046
00:46:25.651 --> 00:46:27.780
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you make coke legal,</v>

1047
00:46:27.870 --> 00:46:30.660
<v Speaker 3>if you make it so that you can go and</v>
<v Speaker 3>buy coke the same way you can go and buy</v>

1048
00:46:30.661 --> 00:46:33.660
<v Speaker 3>whiskey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why not tell me why not?</v>

1049
00:46:33.661 --> 00:46:34.770
<v Speaker 3>I don't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why not.</v>

1050
00:46:34.890 --> 00:46:37.440
<v Speaker 3>If you want to tell me that alcohol</v>
<v Speaker 3>should be illegal as well,</v>

1051
00:46:37.560 --> 00:46:38.161
<v Speaker 3>then I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1052
00:46:38.161 --> 00:46:38.994
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get it,</v>

1053
00:46:39.090 --> 00:46:42.240
<v Speaker 3>but I bet you if you looked at coke</v>
<v Speaker 3>versus alcohol,</v>

1054
00:46:42.241 --> 00:46:44.910
<v Speaker 3>if you look at like daily use of coke</v>
<v Speaker 3>versus alcohol,</v>

1055
00:46:45.120 --> 00:46:48.120
<v Speaker 3>I bet you'd see some real similar like</v>
<v Speaker 3>health problems.</v>

1056
00:46:48.420 --> 00:46:52.680
<v Speaker 3>I bet if it's real similar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it might be even an alcohol might</v>

1057
00:46:52.681 --> 00:46:53.514
<v Speaker 3>lose.</v>

1058
00:46:53.670 --> 00:46:56.220
<v Speaker 3>Like alcohol might be worse for you than</v>
<v Speaker 3>cocaine.</v>

1059
00:46:56.580 --> 00:46:59.370
<v Speaker 3>They're both are terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one's advocating them as like a</v>

1060
00:46:59.371 --> 00:47:02.550
<v Speaker 3>health remedy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but alcohol might be worse than coke,</v>

1061
00:47:02.820 --> 00:47:04.680
<v Speaker 3>but we still that fucking shit</v>
<v Speaker 3>everywhere.</v>

1062
00:47:04.980 --> 00:47:06.360
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I pretty much agree with you on that.</v>

1063
00:47:06.810 --> 00:47:11.810
<v Speaker 3>I think we need adults and children,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but let's get back to children.</v>

1064
00:47:11.850 --> 00:47:13.170
<v Speaker 3>There was something that you didn't just</v>
<v Speaker 3>say get.</v>

1065
00:47:13.171 --> 00:47:16.610
<v Speaker 3>There was things about Bernie Sanders is</v>
<v Speaker 3>a economic platform you didn't like.</v>

1066
00:47:16.650 --> 00:47:20.730
<v Speaker 3>He just said a bunch of crazy shit about</v>
<v Speaker 3>marginal tax rate that he didn't think</v>

1067
00:47:20.731 --> 00:47:25.731
<v Speaker 3>the marginal tax rate is like was it</v>
<v Speaker 3>eisenhower had it at 90 percent while he</v>

1068
00:47:25.921 --> 00:47:30.310
<v Speaker 3>was in office and they asked him if a</v>
<v Speaker 3>marginal tax of 90 percent was too high</v>

1069
00:47:30.370 --> 00:47:31.490
<v Speaker 5>and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

1070
00:47:31.580 --> 00:47:32.890
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wow,</v>

1071
00:47:32.891 --> 00:47:36.790
<v Speaker 5>that's 90 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Here's the thing about taxes and this is</v>

1072
00:47:36.791 --> 00:47:38.890
<v Speaker 5>the number one most important point.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're talking here.</v>

1073
00:47:39.010 --> 00:47:42.370
<v Speaker 5>We're not talking about rich people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Definitely having income equality,</v>

1074
00:47:42.371 --> 00:47:45.240
<v Speaker 5>having way too much money,</v>
<v Speaker 5>way too much influence in changing the</v>

1075
00:47:45.250 --> 00:47:48.820
<v Speaker 5>laws to make it even easier for them to</v>
<v Speaker 5>protect themselves and save money.</v>

1076
00:47:49.120 --> 00:47:52.390
<v Speaker 5>We're not talking about that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're talking about taxes and taxes are</v>

1077
00:47:52.391 --> 00:47:55.570
<v Speaker 5>sneaky because taxes go to the</v>
<v Speaker 5>government and the more money the</v>

1078
00:47:55.571 --> 00:47:56.950
<v Speaker 5>government gets,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the bigger it gets.</v>

1079
00:47:56.951 --> 00:48:00.040
<v Speaker 5>It becomes cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It starts fucking growing and swelling</v>

1080
00:48:00.041 --> 00:48:03.760
<v Speaker 5>and you get bureaucracy and you get red</v>
<v Speaker 5>tape and you get a lot of bullshit.</v>

1081
00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:07.990
<v Speaker 5>If you could ensure that the money was</v>
<v Speaker 5>going to these really enlightened people</v>

1082
00:48:07.991 --> 00:48:11.980
<v Speaker 5>who are super wise and are going to</v>
<v Speaker 5>figure out some awesome solutions to</v>

1083
00:48:11.981 --> 00:48:16.000
<v Speaker 5>reengineer our society and they make</v>
<v Speaker 5>poor people happy and well fed,</v>

1084
00:48:16.210 --> 00:48:18.370
<v Speaker 5>well then yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a great idea,</v>

1085
00:48:18.490 --> 00:48:20.190
<v Speaker 5>but until then what you're doing is you</v>
<v Speaker 5>just.</v>

1086
00:48:20.310 --> 00:48:25.310
<v Speaker 5>You're finding successful people and</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're taking more from them like you're</v>

1087
00:48:26.201 --> 00:48:30.970
<v Speaker 5>cutting away incentive incentive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're cutting away this ability to get</v>

1088
00:48:30.971 --> 00:48:32.590
<v Speaker 5>to the place where you could buy an</v>
<v Speaker 5>island.</v>

1089
00:48:32.591 --> 00:48:34.060
<v Speaker 5>You're saying you shouldn't be able to</v>
<v Speaker 5>do that.</v>

1090
00:48:34.300 --> 00:48:36.940
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if you can do cocaine every</v>

1091
00:48:36.940 --> 00:48:41.890
<v Speaker 5>day of your life or you can bust your</v>
<v Speaker 5>ass and develop a company like Google</v>

1092
00:48:41.980 --> 00:48:44.980
<v Speaker 5>and then buy a fucking island that's</v>
<v Speaker 5>also in the game.</v>

1093
00:48:45.250 --> 00:48:47.860
<v Speaker 5>It's in the game.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't necessarily mean you're evil</v>

1094
00:48:47.980 --> 00:48:51.670
<v Speaker 5>and this idea that because someone</v>
<v Speaker 5>figures out how to do it and I'm talking</v>

1095
00:48:51.671 --> 00:48:54.130
<v Speaker 5>about only ethically and within the</v>
<v Speaker 5>boundaries of the rules.</v>

1096
00:48:54.310 --> 00:48:59.170
<v Speaker 5>I think the issue that Bernie says that</v>
<v Speaker 5>I agree with is people that don't work</v>

1097
00:48:59.171 --> 00:49:01.720
<v Speaker 5>within the boundaries of the rules that</v>
<v Speaker 5>we all agreed on and they've figured out</v>

1098
00:49:01.721 --> 00:49:05.620
<v Speaker 5>all these sneaky fucking loopholes and</v>
<v Speaker 5>it essentially bribed politicians to</v>

1099
00:49:05.621 --> 00:49:09.520
<v Speaker 5>making it easier for them to move money</v>
<v Speaker 5>around and not pay taxes on things.</v>

1100
00:49:09.540 --> 00:49:13.350
<v Speaker 5>I'm with him 100 percent on that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the.</v>

1101
00:49:13.570 --> 00:49:16.690
<v Speaker 5>I don't think the answer is taxing the</v>
<v Speaker 5>fuck out of people,</v>

1102
00:49:16.930 --> 00:49:18.460
<v Speaker 5>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and he's going to have to tax the middle</v>

1103
00:49:18.461 --> 00:49:20.740
<v Speaker 5>class higher too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's admitted that when he goes over his</v>

1104
00:49:20.741 --> 00:49:21.190
<v Speaker 5>life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sure.</v>

1105
00:49:21.190 --> 00:49:22.650
<v Speaker 5>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Plan you should take.</v>

1106
00:49:22.690 --> 00:49:25.480
<v Speaker 5>People don't need to be taxed more.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We need to do is figure out a</v>

1107
00:49:25.481 --> 00:49:30.481
<v Speaker 5>responsible method of managing the money</v>
<v Speaker 5>that we already fucking pay you guys.</v>

1108
00:49:30.730 --> 00:49:35.040
<v Speaker 5>That's way better than taking more.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's way better than taking more so</v>

1109
00:49:35.310 --> 00:49:37.720
<v Speaker 5>when someone says they want to see more</v>
<v Speaker 5>taxes,</v>

1110
00:49:37.721 --> 00:49:40.150
<v Speaker 5>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>stop with this talk.</v>

1111
00:49:40.300 --> 00:49:43.210
<v Speaker 5>You're doing a shitty job of managing</v>
<v Speaker 5>all the money people are giving you</v>

1112
00:49:43.211 --> 00:49:45.580
<v Speaker 5>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How about figure that out first?</v>

1113
00:49:45.820 --> 00:49:47.230
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean you're definitely right and I'm</v>

1114
00:49:47.231 --> 00:49:48.220
<v Speaker 5>running for office.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jamie,</v>

1115
00:49:48.370 --> 00:49:50.550
<v Speaker 5>you're gonna run for office,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fire it up to Jay.</v>

1116
00:49:50.580 --> 00:49:52.840
<v Speaker 5>Got Me fired up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't usually get this fired up about</v>

1117
00:49:52.930 --> 00:49:54.250
<v Speaker 5>something I think is a rigged game.</v>

1118
00:49:55.790 --> 00:49:57.720
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it turned progress.</v>

1119
00:49:57.880 --> 00:50:00.790
<v Speaker 2>Turned you into a believer in a ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A little bit.</v>

1120
00:50:00.820 --> 00:50:01.960
<v Speaker 2>But let me tell you this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1121
00:50:01.961 --> 00:50:03.070
<v Speaker 2>I agree with you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean,</v>

1122
00:50:03.071 --> 00:50:04.630
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1123
00:50:05.670 --> 00:50:06.970
<v Speaker 2>government,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the government program,</v>

1124
00:50:06.971 --> 00:50:09.580
<v Speaker 2>there's definitely some government</v>
<v Speaker 2>programs that produce results and have</v>

1125
00:50:09.581 --> 00:50:11.050
<v Speaker 2>efficacy and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1126
00:50:11.270 --> 00:50:12.820
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're right,</v>

1127
00:50:12.821 --> 00:50:14.410
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's too much bureaucracy,</v>

1128
00:50:14.411 --> 00:50:17.260
<v Speaker 2>there's too much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's too many things where everything</v>

1129
00:50:17.261 --> 00:50:19.630
<v Speaker 2>is just fucking in disarray.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the va and Shit,</v>

1130
00:50:19.990 --> 00:50:20.823
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

1131
00:50:21.020 --> 00:50:24.490
<v Speaker 2>there was so many files in one va</v>
<v Speaker 2>building that the building was actually</v>

1132
00:50:24.520 --> 00:50:26.000
<v Speaker 2>collapsing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1133
00:50:26.001 --> 00:50:28.010
<v Speaker 2>just under the weight of all these files</v>
<v Speaker 2>upon</v>

1134
00:50:28.010 --> 00:50:31.110
<v Speaker 1>files.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

1135
00:50:31.190 --> 00:50:33.650
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is kind of hard to argue that more</v>

1136
00:50:33.651 --> 00:50:37.460
<v Speaker 1>money needs to be spent when the</v>
<v Speaker 1>situation is like that.</v>

1137
00:50:37.520 --> 00:50:39.770
<v Speaker 1>What's also going to the irs and the irs</v>
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

1138
00:50:39.771 --> 00:50:42.050
<v Speaker 1>But I mean there's so many tactics</v>
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>

1139
00:50:42.051 --> 00:50:44.750
<v Speaker 1>There's so many problems though in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>country that really do need to be</v>

1140
00:50:44.751 --> 00:50:47.810
<v Speaker 1>resolved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like our infrastructure is shit and no</v>

1141
00:50:47.811 --> 00:50:50.420
<v Speaker 1>one wants to talk about infrastructure</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it isn't boring fucking topic.</v>

1142
00:50:50.421 --> 00:50:53.470
<v Speaker 1>No one wants to talk about the bridges</v>
<v Speaker 1>and roads crumbling and shit.</v>

1143
00:50:53.930 --> 00:50:54.763
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's good point.</v>

1144
00:50:54.770 --> 00:50:55.730
<v Speaker 1>That's a very good point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1145
00:50:55.731 --> 00:50:58.460
<v Speaker 1>the architects and engineers been</v>
<v Speaker 1>telling us for years,</v>

1146
00:50:58.461 --> 00:50:59.031
<v Speaker 1>our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our,</v>

1147
00:50:59.031 --> 00:51:01.190
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our grades and infrastructure are</v>

1148
00:51:01.191 --> 00:51:03.890
<v Speaker 1>fucking d's and f's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not doing great.</v>

1149
00:51:04.010 --> 00:51:05.690
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I grew up in Boston or costs a lot of</v>

1150
00:51:05.691 --> 00:51:09.170
<v Speaker 1>money to fix it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I grew up in Boston and Boston had the</v>

1151
00:51:09.171 --> 00:51:09.920
<v Speaker 1>big dig.</v>

1152
00:51:09.920 --> 00:51:11.480
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's also one thing I like about</v>

1153
00:51:11.481 --> 00:51:12.314
<v Speaker 1>trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the way.</v>

1154
00:51:12.970 --> 00:51:15.200
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he has seems to be committed to</v>

1155
00:51:15.201 --> 00:51:17.600
<v Speaker 1>rebuilding America's infrastructure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one thing I will give him.</v>

1156
00:51:17.720 --> 00:51:18.411
<v Speaker 1>That is true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1157
00:51:18.411 --> 00:51:21.110
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's going to take a radical approach</v>

1158
00:51:21.140 --> 00:51:24.040
<v Speaker 1>that's different from the radical</v>
<v Speaker 1>approach of Bernie Sanders to,</v>

1159
00:51:24.070 --> 00:51:26.150
<v Speaker 1>in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are the two that are most</v>

1160
00:51:26.151 --> 00:51:28.040
<v Speaker 1>interesting to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unless someone can prove to me that</v>

1161
00:51:28.041 --> 00:51:30.830
<v Speaker 1>Hillary Clinton is not totally healthy</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1162
00:51:31.080 --> 00:51:32.450
<v Speaker 1>and cheese.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1163
00:51:32.690 --> 00:51:35.690
<v Speaker 1>and that also she's not just some robot</v>
<v Speaker 1>monster.</v>

1164
00:51:36.470 --> 00:51:39.110
<v Speaker 1>That's what she is though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's color Schullery.</v>

1165
00:51:39.140 --> 00:51:41.510
<v Speaker 1>You don't think she's interested in her?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think she's pure.</v>

1166
00:51:41.511 --> 00:51:43.820
<v Speaker 1>I mean like I've been.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I would be interested in her if I</v>

1167
00:51:43.821 --> 00:51:47.690
<v Speaker 1>could look beneath the mask,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I could see who she actually is the</v>

1168
00:51:47.691 --> 00:51:52.691
<v Speaker 1>person and get a sense of a human being</v>
<v Speaker 1>that resides within this completely fake</v>

1169
00:51:53.361 --> 00:51:57.920
<v Speaker 1>exterior with just to be just a place to</v>
<v Speaker 1>advocate because I kept doing it.</v>

1170
00:51:58.010 --> 00:52:00.800
<v Speaker 1>Do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How hard is it to be fucking Hillary</v>

1171
00:52:00.800 --> 00:52:01.880
<v Speaker 1>Clinton?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's probably brutal.</v>

1172
00:52:01.950 --> 00:52:05.390
<v Speaker 1>The scrutiny that she gets to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>constant attention,</v>

1173
00:52:05.570 --> 00:52:09.500
<v Speaker 1>the people like she probably has to put</v>
<v Speaker 1>up a wall just to get through life,</v>

1174
00:52:09.860 --> 00:52:10.550
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1175
00:52:10.550 --> 00:52:14.900
<v Speaker 1>her behavior as a politician probably</v>
<v Speaker 1>mimics her behavior as a person.</v>

1176
00:52:14.901 --> 00:52:18.140
<v Speaker 1>Look at the amount of Shit Donald trump</v>
<v Speaker 1>gets about to recommend mushrooms to</v>

1177
00:52:18.141 --> 00:52:21.810
<v Speaker 1>Hillary and Donald together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at Donald Trump gets one thing that</v>

1178
00:52:21.860 --> 00:52:23.990
<v Speaker 1>Donald Trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He takes criticism way better than</v>

1179
00:52:23.991 --> 00:52:26.540
<v Speaker 1>Hillary because Donald Trump's response</v>
<v Speaker 1>to criticism is like,</v>

1180
00:52:26.660 --> 00:52:28.040
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck you.</v>

1181
00:52:28.190 --> 00:52:32.480
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hillary Clinton tries to project this</v>

1182
00:52:32.481 --> 00:52:37.070
<v Speaker 1>image of being this flawless being that</v>
<v Speaker 1>never makes a mistake,</v>

1183
00:52:37.071 --> 00:52:39.260
<v Speaker 1>and even if you think she did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're mistaken,</v>

1184
00:52:39.410 --> 00:52:44.180
<v Speaker 1>you're wrong to Donald Trump on</v>
<v Speaker 1>mushrooms with Mexicans in Mexico,</v>

1185
00:52:44.210 --> 00:52:48.650
<v Speaker 1>so he gets a deep love of Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just fuck this border.</v>

1186
00:52:48.651 --> 00:52:49.850
<v Speaker 1>He just goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck this border.</v>

1187
00:52:49.880 --> 00:52:51.740
<v Speaker 1>Why do we have a border?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck,</v>

1188
00:52:51.741 --> 00:52:54.080
<v Speaker 1>let's just have all the same money and</v>
<v Speaker 1>no border.</v>

1189
00:52:54.110 --> 00:52:55.630
<v Speaker 1>Boom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the gates open,</v>

1190
00:52:56.700 --> 00:53:00.050
<v Speaker 1>legalized and legalize mushrooms and</v>
<v Speaker 1>weed,</v>

1191
00:53:00.170 --> 00:53:03.410
<v Speaker 1>and you would have liked the cartel</v>
<v Speaker 1>would have zero power.</v>

1192
00:53:03.530 --> 00:53:05.660
<v Speaker 1>They would go under or they would be</v>
<v Speaker 1>significantly.</v>

1193
00:53:05.661 --> 00:53:10.490
<v Speaker 1>We wonder what the result would be of</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to merge the dollar and the peso</v>

1194
00:53:10.491 --> 00:53:14.540
<v Speaker 1>together in norland currency.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1195
00:53:14.570 --> 00:53:17.330
<v Speaker 1>white dudes were to explode all over the</v>
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>

1196
00:53:17.540 --> 00:53:20.810
<v Speaker 1>You would have white,</v>
<v Speaker 1>white fat guys with like loose skin</v>

1197
00:53:20.811 --> 00:53:24.020
<v Speaker 1>screaming at the top of their lungs like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that movie scanners.</v>

1198
00:53:24.140 --> 00:53:26.390
<v Speaker 1>I love that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

1199
00:53:26.820 --> 00:53:29.610
<v Speaker 1>If they open up the fucking borders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

1200
00:53:29.611 --> 00:53:31.030
<v Speaker 1>it would be amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'd be.</v>

1201
00:53:31.240 --> 00:53:32.910
<v Speaker 1>It'd be great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would be.</v>

1202
00:53:32.940 --> 00:53:34.320
<v Speaker 1>It really would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would be great.</v>

1203
00:53:34.321 --> 00:53:37.800
<v Speaker 1>People need to stop just as long as you</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't let any Canadians in federal law.</v>

1204
00:53:38.040 --> 00:53:39.840
<v Speaker 1>They would make it way more polite.</v>

1205
00:53:40.050 --> 00:53:41.910
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you what.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are we in Canada?</v>

1206
00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:44.100
<v Speaker 1>One of the other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now there's less of them,</v>

1207
00:53:44.101 --> 00:53:46.440
<v Speaker 1>so I think that we would just make them</v>
<v Speaker 1>rude,</v>

1208
00:53:46.441 --> 00:53:49.110
<v Speaker 1>obnoxious assholes like us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1209
00:53:49.590 --> 00:53:50.371
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1210
00:53:50.371 --> 00:53:53.610
<v Speaker 1>They're pretty firmly established as</v>
<v Speaker 1>nice folks.</v>

1211
00:53:54.260 --> 00:53:57.810
<v Speaker 1>They are so much nicer than Americans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say Canadians are 20 percent</v>

1212
00:53:57.811 --> 00:53:58.830
<v Speaker 1>nicer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1213
00:53:59.310 --> 00:53:59.791
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1214
00:53:59.791 --> 00:54:01.620
<v Speaker 1>I've met some Canadians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I would agree.</v>

1215
00:54:02.040 --> 00:54:03.870
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're strange country though.</v>

1216
00:54:03.990 --> 00:54:08.340
<v Speaker 1>When you first go waiting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like going from Boston to Montreal.</v>

1217
00:54:08.430 --> 00:54:10.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm waiting for like the true people to</v>
<v Speaker 1>come out.</v>

1218
00:54:10.981 --> 00:54:13.290
<v Speaker 1>My can we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you guys are in the cold to how come</v>

1219
00:54:13.291 --> 00:54:17.340
<v Speaker 1>you're not a bunch of evil cunt like me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can find mean people everywhere.</v>

1220
00:54:17.400 --> 00:54:18.570
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the difference between the way</v>

1221
00:54:18.571 --> 00:54:22.050
<v Speaker 1>people behaved in Montreal versus the</v>
<v Speaker 1>way people behaved in Boston,</v>

1222
00:54:22.051 --> 00:54:22.950
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1223
00:54:23.310 --> 00:54:24.570
<v Speaker 1>how weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1224
00:54:24.571 --> 00:54:27.060
<v Speaker 1>Boston's like very aggressive.</v>

1225
00:54:27.120 --> 00:54:28.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like known for that.</v>

1226
00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:31.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's boat people.</v>

1227
00:54:31.800 --> 00:54:35.370
<v Speaker 1>People that came over on boats drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They crashed their 200 years ago.</v>

1228
00:54:35.371 --> 00:54:37.890
<v Speaker 1>They stayed and they fuck they had kids</v>
<v Speaker 1>ruined their lives.</v>

1229
00:54:37.891 --> 00:54:40.410
<v Speaker 1>They had kids ruin their lives and now</v>
<v Speaker 1>here they are right now,</v>

1230
00:54:40.720 --> 00:54:43.050
<v Speaker 1>a few,</v>
<v Speaker 1>four or five generations later,</v>

1231
00:54:43.170 --> 00:54:45.120
<v Speaker 1>maybe three.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should point out that,</v>

1232
00:54:45.121 --> 00:54:48.390
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Boston accent is one of the most</v>

1233
00:54:49.110 --> 00:54:51.900
<v Speaker 1>horrible sounds to my ears.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's disgusting.</v>

1234
00:54:51.960 --> 00:54:55.920
<v Speaker 1>It's really wretched.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had one for awhile because I was uh,</v>

1235
00:54:56.100 --> 00:54:57.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I moved to,</v>

1236
00:54:57.391 --> 00:54:58.530
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hear it anymore,</v>

1237
00:54:58.531 --> 00:55:02.520
<v Speaker 1>but I hear it occasionally if I have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>couple of drinks,</v>

1238
00:55:03.170 --> 00:55:07.530
<v Speaker 1>a word will come out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I heard myself a talk once and I was</v>

1239
00:55:07.531 --> 00:55:08.364
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

1240
00:55:08.430 --> 00:55:10.800
<v Speaker 1>I heard like a recording and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>

1241
00:55:11.100 --> 00:55:14.130
<v Speaker 1>That's what I sound like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't realize I sounded like that.</v>

1242
00:55:14.340 --> 00:55:19.020
<v Speaker 1>So I made a concerted effort to stop</v>
<v Speaker 1>speaking like that where could really</v>

1243
00:55:19.021 --> 00:55:23.160
<v Speaker 1>hard and had oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stop things that they all talk like</v>

1244
00:55:23.161 --> 00:55:25.110
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a monsters.</v>

1245
00:55:25.380 --> 00:55:28.530
<v Speaker 1>Don't do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's fun.</v>

1246
00:55:28.650 --> 00:55:30.650
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you what though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's funny when it comes out of</v>

1247
00:55:30.660 --> 00:55:32.190
<v Speaker 1>comedian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you what though.</v>

1248
00:55:32.191 --> 00:55:35.130
<v Speaker 1>I'm my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my southern accent will come out if I'm</v>

1249
00:55:35.131 --> 00:55:39.480
<v Speaker 1>angry or I'm really drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Got To just do y'all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did y'all ever come out of your mouth?</v>

1251
00:55:43.080 --> 00:55:44.310
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll say y'all.</v>

1252
00:55:44.311 --> 00:55:48.810
<v Speaker 1>Even even without speaking in a southern</v>
<v Speaker 1>southern affectation,</v>

1253
00:55:48.811 --> 00:55:51.410
<v Speaker 1>I'll still use y'all because I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I actually will make an argument for</v>
<v Speaker 1>y'all because you know,</v>

1255
00:55:54.091 --> 00:55:56.070
<v Speaker 1>it is actually easier than it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1256
00:55:56.071 --> 00:55:57.690
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a legitimate contraction.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You all,</v>

<v Speaker 1>it seems to buy pasta all.</v>

1260
00:56:06.150 --> 00:56:09.240

<v Speaker 1>It is like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1262
00:56:12.090 --> 00:56:14.820
<v Speaker 1>That's not even in that context.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sounds friendly.</v>

1263
00:56:14.880 --> 00:56:16.920
<v Speaker 1>Fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess you could say it like that,</v>

1264
00:56:17.250 --> 00:56:19.140
<v Speaker 1>but it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's more like what y'all doing,</v>

1265
00:56:19.470 --> 00:56:22.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like everybody's like casual.</v>

1266
00:56:22.140 --> 00:56:23.080
<v Speaker 1>It's a casual word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1267
00:56:23.081 --> 00:56:25.030
<v Speaker 1>it's the difference between the black</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the white.</v>

1268
00:56:25.031 --> 00:56:26.330
<v Speaker 1>Y'All,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1269
00:56:26.380 --> 00:56:28.240
<v Speaker 1>what are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Getting racist here and a little bit,</v>

1270
00:56:29.170 --> 00:56:31.360
<v Speaker 1>just a Smidgen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>

1271
00:56:31.660 --> 00:56:34.320
<v Speaker 1>if there are any differences between</v>
<v Speaker 1>black people and white people,</v>

1272
00:56:34.330 --> 00:56:37.390
<v Speaker 1>I'd like you to not address those</v>
<v Speaker 1>because those in faculty be</v>

1273
00:56:37.391 --> 00:56:39.580
<v Speaker 1>microaggressions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1274
00:56:40.120 --> 00:56:42.430
<v Speaker 1>do you not know about microaggression?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do know about microaggressions.</v>

1275
00:56:42.431 --> 00:56:43.360
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a white male.</v>

1276
00:56:43.361 --> 00:56:45.190
<v Speaker 1>You're a walking microaggressions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>True.</v>

1277
00:56:45.191 --> 00:56:46.510
<v Speaker 1>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How dare you.</v>

1278
00:56:46.900 --> 00:56:50.610
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>black dudes have bigger dicks so they</v>

1279
00:56:50.620 --> 00:56:52.240
<v Speaker 1>don't ever know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't object to that one.</v>

1280
00:56:52.250 --> 00:56:55.050
<v Speaker 1>That is microaggression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Black men,</v>

1281
00:56:55.140 --> 00:56:57.430
<v Speaker 1>they never backed black men that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1282
00:56:57.431 --> 00:57:00.220
<v Speaker 1>they have that expectation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if white men or white women,</v>

1283
00:57:00.250 --> 00:57:03.970
<v Speaker 1>either one only go out with them because</v>
<v Speaker 1>they expect the big black Dick and</v>

1284
00:57:03.971 --> 00:57:05.200
<v Speaker 1>meanwhile these guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1285
00:57:05.280 --> 00:57:08.230
<v Speaker 1>they dread,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they live in fear of the moment.</v>

1286
00:57:08.231 --> 00:57:09.860
<v Speaker 1>They have to put out their normal cock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1287
00:57:09.861 --> 00:57:11.830
<v Speaker 1>all they gotta do is when they whip it</v>
<v Speaker 1>out and be like,</v>

1288
00:57:11.831 --> 00:57:14.530
<v Speaker 1>surprise bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that'll work.</v>

1289
00:57:14.531 --> 00:57:17.980
<v Speaker 1>Once it will work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll work more than once.</v>

1290
00:57:18.010 --> 00:57:20.260
<v Speaker 1>We'll work on different people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're going to have to get to that</v>

1291
00:57:20.261 --> 00:57:22.690
<v Speaker 1>position over and over and over again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the hardest position.</v>

1292
00:57:22.691 --> 00:57:25.480
<v Speaker 1>I guess you'll just have to get by on</v>
<v Speaker 1>personality or something.</v>

1293
00:57:26.950 --> 00:57:28.210
<v Speaker 1>Boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're asking a lot.</v>

1294
00:57:31.570 --> 00:57:34.720
<v Speaker 1>I have to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not working with much.</v>

1295
00:57:34.930 --> 00:57:36.820
<v Speaker 1>How did you start making these youtube</v>
<v Speaker 1>videos?</v>

1296
00:57:37.330 --> 00:57:38.350
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1297
00:57:38.351 --> 00:57:38.981
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's funny,</v>

1298
00:57:38.981 --> 00:57:40.570
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was there,</v>

1299
00:57:41.140 --> 00:57:44.500
<v Speaker 2>I was there from almost the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm the one of the few people that still</v>

1300
00:57:44.770 --> 00:57:46.870
<v Speaker 2>from the old youtube because when did</v>
<v Speaker 2>you start?</v>

1301
00:57:47.170 --> 00:57:48.850
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nine years ago.</v>

1302
00:57:48.910 --> 00:57:50.620
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Two thousand seven.</v>

1303
00:57:50.621 --> 00:57:52.690
<v Speaker 2>Two Thousand and eight Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how long youtube tube's been</v>

1304
00:57:52.691 --> 00:57:53.290
<v Speaker 2>around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1305
00:57:53.290 --> 00:57:54.430
<v Speaker 2>While,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1306
00:57:54.580 --> 00:57:57.910
<v Speaker 2>but I mean it's not that long at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1307
00:57:58.180 --> 00:58:00.430
<v Speaker 2>Well to me it seems like a really long</v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

1308
00:58:00.520 --> 00:58:03.010
<v Speaker 2>That's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1309
00:58:03.011 --> 00:58:05.770
<v Speaker 2>I think it started in 2006 or something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I wasn't there from the very</v>

1310
00:58:05.771 --> 00:58:09.040
<v Speaker 2>beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But everyone who was big at the time,</v>

1311
00:58:09.850 --> 00:58:12.070
<v Speaker 2>I don't think any of them are big now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they're all gone.</v>

1312
00:58:12.730 --> 00:58:16.570
<v Speaker 2>So I mean it seems like the shelf life</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a youtube channel is pretty short,</v>

1313
00:58:16.571 --> 00:58:18.880
<v Speaker 2>so I'm glad I've been around this entire</v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

1314
00:58:19.180 --> 00:58:20.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I mean I guess I just started</v>

1315
00:58:20.951 --> 00:58:23.890
<v Speaker 2>because I went on there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was already being like a fucking</v>

1316
00:58:23.891 --> 00:58:28.420
<v Speaker 2>asshole atheist troll to people in like</v>
<v Speaker 2>Internet forums and stuff.</v>

1317
00:58:28.960 --> 00:58:31.510
<v Speaker 2>So a bunch of people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they like the way I wrote,</v>

1318
00:58:31.810 --> 00:58:33.640
<v Speaker 2>they told me I should take my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1319
00:58:33.641 --> 00:58:35.680
<v Speaker 2>I should take it on youtube and I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kinda like,</v>

1320
00:58:35.710 --> 00:58:36.670
<v Speaker 2>Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

1321
00:58:37.150 --> 00:58:40.030
<v Speaker 2>I don't really feel like I have much of</v>
<v Speaker 2>a camera presence or whatever,</v>

1322
00:58:40.031 --> 00:58:40.830
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1323
00:58:40.830 --> 00:58:45.280
<v Speaker 2>I went on youtube and I made a horrible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>horrible fucking video that is just</v>

1324
00:58:45.281 --> 00:58:47.460
<v Speaker 2>wretched in every way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

1325
00:58:47.850 --> 00:58:52.810
<v Speaker 2>I walk around my garage talking in this</v>
<v Speaker 2>monotone voice like this,</v>

1326
00:58:53.500 --> 00:58:56.420
<v Speaker 2>but for some reason some people liked it</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

1327
00:58:56.710 --> 00:58:59.920
<v Speaker 2>I kept doing it and I got a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 2>more natural in front of the camera as I</v>

1328
00:58:59.921 --> 00:59:01.180
<v Speaker 2>stopped treating it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1329
00:59:01.780 --> 00:59:04.030
<v Speaker 2>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started treating it more like a person</v>

1330
00:59:04.031 --> 00:59:06.240
<v Speaker 2>or a friend.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1331
00:59:06.570 --> 00:59:08.020
<v Speaker 2>over time it just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

1332
00:59:08.260 --> 00:59:11.320
<v Speaker 2>I've never been like the biggest channel</v>
<v Speaker 2>on youtube or anything,</v>

1333
00:59:11.321 --> 00:59:13.660
<v Speaker 2>but it's just always been consistently</v>
<v Speaker 2>successful.</v>

1334
00:59:13.661 --> 00:59:18.310
<v Speaker 2>Consistently grows consistently,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seems to keep pace with,</v>

1335
00:59:18.360 --> 00:59:21.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever the standard of being on the</v>

1336
00:59:21.050 --> 00:59:21.980
<v Speaker 2>lower end of the</v>

1337
00:59:21.980 --> 00:59:24.860
<v Speaker 3>popularity scale of youtube is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1338
00:59:24.861 --> 00:59:28.520
<v Speaker 3>I feel like youtube in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's one of those things where if you do</v>

1339
00:59:28.521 --> 00:59:32.390
<v Speaker 3>a show like yours,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's really important is consistency.</v>

1340
00:59:32.420 --> 00:59:36.170
<v Speaker 3>You've got to do it a lot so that people</v>
<v Speaker 3>get addicted to it and you also just</v>

1341
00:59:36.171 --> 00:59:38.720
<v Speaker 3>have to put a lot of effort into it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And those are two things that you do,</v>

1342
00:59:39.020 --> 00:59:40.400
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're really consistent,</v>

1343
00:59:40.401 --> 00:59:44.420
<v Speaker 3>you put a lot of videos and I try,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you obviously have like really well</v>

1344
00:59:44.421 --> 00:59:48.010
<v Speaker 3>thought out points of view in these</v>
<v Speaker 3>things and you argue them well and,</v>

1345
00:59:48.120 --> 00:59:50.150
<v Speaker 3>and in a funny way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1346
00:59:50.151 --> 00:59:54.710
<v Speaker 3>and that's kind of interesting that</v>
<v Speaker 3>before youtube and before the Internet I</v>

1347
00:59:54.711 --> 00:59:57.440
<v Speaker 3>got like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would have struggled to find a</v>

1348
00:59:57.441 --> 01:00:00.140
<v Speaker 3>forum,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if you wanted to go to some</v>

1349

<v Speaker 3>you have on your Youtube Channel?</v>

1357

<v Speaker 3>High average.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Four to 5 million views a month.</v>

<v Speaker 3>views a month.</v>

<v Speaker 3>And you sell in America right now.</v>

1363
01:00:32.190 --> 01:00:33.023
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1364
01:00:33.270 --> 01:00:35.820
<v Speaker 2>the weird thing about the whole youtube</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing is though,</v>

1365
01:00:37.010 --> 01:00:39.870
<v Speaker 2>I mean I have two successful channels</v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

1366
01:00:39.871 --> 01:00:42.570
<v Speaker 2>I have the amazing atheist channel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the older channel.</v>

1367
01:00:42.571 --> 01:00:44.760
<v Speaker 2>I have the drunken peasants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a podcast channel.</v>

1368
01:00:44.761 --> 01:00:47.770
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing kind of what you were doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1369
01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:51.030
<v Speaker 2>and that's doing well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's only a couple of years old,</v>

1370
01:00:52.830 --> 01:00:54.390
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was thinking if,</v>

1371
01:00:54.420 --> 01:00:55.830
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it weren't for Youtube,</v>

1372
01:00:55.831 --> 01:01:00.540
<v Speaker 2>I mean before when I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to want to either be a writer and</v>

1373
01:01:00.541 --> 01:01:03.660
<v Speaker 2>really it was writing that Kinda got me</v>
<v Speaker 2>into doing youtube anyway because I was</v>

1374
01:01:03.661 --> 01:01:06.450
<v Speaker 2>just like a forum troll that would argue</v>
<v Speaker 2>with people on the Internet.</v>

1375
01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:08.490
<v Speaker 2>I had no fucking life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1376
01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:10.530
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well because it's exciting.</v>

1377
01:01:10.620 --> 01:01:12.630
<v Speaker 2>It's fun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's fun for me and I like pushing</v>

1378
01:01:12.631 --> 01:01:14.010
<v Speaker 2>buttons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It pissing people off,</v>

1379
01:01:14.340 --> 01:01:15.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll say things just to piss people off.</v>

1380
01:01:15.990 --> 01:01:16.950
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1381
01:01:16.980 --> 01:01:19.220
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1382
01:01:19.230 --> 01:01:21.330
<v Speaker 2>I do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I guess that probably I would've</v>

1383
01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:23.130
<v Speaker 2>had to try to be a comedian or</v>
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>

1384
01:01:23.131 --> 01:01:25.580
<v Speaker 2>but when you were there in the day with</v>
<v Speaker 2>flame wars,</v>

1385
01:01:25.620 --> 01:01:28.980
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't want to be a comedian though</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I don't want to have to always</v>

1386
01:01:28.981 --> 01:01:30.570
<v Speaker 2>be funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to feel pressure.</v>

1387
01:01:30.571 --> 01:01:32.910
<v Speaker 2>Like everything I say has to be a</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking joke,</v>

1388
01:01:32.911 --> 01:01:35.400
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well it only does on stage,</v>

1389
01:01:35.670 --> 01:01:36.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that.</v>

1390
01:01:36.691 --> 01:01:38.320
<v Speaker 2>But I mean I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want the,</v>

1391
01:01:38.610 --> 01:01:43.060
<v Speaker 2>I don't want people to think that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>performance has to be about laughter or</v>

1392
01:01:43.620 --> 01:01:47.100
<v Speaker 2>whatever you're producing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's a song of the cast stuff.</v>

1393
01:01:47.101 --> 01:01:48.580
<v Speaker 2>I try to be funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Another thing though is,</v>

1394
01:01:48.600 --> 01:01:50.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a lot harder to gauge whether</v>

1395
01:01:50.191 --> 01:01:52.890
<v Speaker 2>people are finding it funny or not</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you know,</v>

1396
01:01:52.891 --> 01:01:56.190
<v Speaker 2>I don't have a live reaction to what I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>saying.</v>

1397
01:01:56.191 --> 01:01:58.380
<v Speaker 2>So sometimes some shit that I think is</v>
<v Speaker 2>really funny,</v>

1398
01:01:58.381 --> 01:02:00.810
<v Speaker 2>people would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this video was cringe or something,</v>

1399
01:02:00.811 --> 01:02:01.381
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1400
01:02:01.381 --> 01:02:02.670
<v Speaker 2>Oh fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess I will.</v>

1401
01:02:02.671 --> 01:02:05.100
<v Speaker 2>That's always going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The king wasn't as funny as I thought I</v>

1402
01:02:05.101 --> 01:02:07.530
<v Speaker 2>bombed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>While you're also dealing with a.</v>

1403
01:02:07.940 --> 01:02:11.250
<v Speaker 2>what's the sample group?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What percentage of people leave</v>

1404
01:02:11.251 --> 01:02:12.690
<v Speaker 2>comments?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it even one?</v>

1405
01:02:13.110 --> 01:02:16.530
<v Speaker 2>It might not even be one tiny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a tiny in that sample.</v>

1406
01:02:16.560 --> 01:02:18.720
<v Speaker 2>It's a tiny percentage of people that</v>
<v Speaker 2>write the videos.</v>

1407
01:02:18.721 --> 01:02:20.010
<v Speaker 2>It's a percentage of people that</v>

1408
01:02:20.010 --> 01:02:23.310
<v Speaker 3>comment on the videos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most people they just watched.</v>

1409
01:02:23.311 --> 01:02:25.140
<v Speaker 3>They don't interact in any way</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatsoever,</v>

1410
01:02:25.141 --> 01:02:26.730
<v Speaker 3>so it's impossible to know what they</v>
<v Speaker 3>think,</v>

1411
01:02:26.790 --> 01:02:28.830
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they keep coming back so they must see</v>

1412
01:02:28.831 --> 01:02:29.664
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>

1413
01:02:29.700 --> 01:02:32.370
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the people that are fine,</v>

1414
01:02:32.371 --> 01:02:34.470
<v Speaker 3>like the one thing you said that piss</v>
<v Speaker 3>them off,</v>

1415
01:02:34.471 --> 01:02:35.790
<v Speaker 3>that makes them go on this rant about</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

1416
01:02:35.791 --> 01:02:37.380
<v Speaker 3>You should die in the fucking car</v>
<v Speaker 3>accident.</v>

1417
01:02:37.710 --> 01:02:41.040
<v Speaker 3>Those those people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you're missing the whole point of</v>

1418
01:02:41.041 --> 01:02:44.520
<v Speaker 3>what one of these things is like if you</v>
<v Speaker 3>have a different point of view,</v>

1419
01:02:44.790 --> 01:02:49.320
<v Speaker 3>you should establish your own channel</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you should go fucking make your own</v>

1420
01:02:49.321 --> 01:02:51.900
<v Speaker 3>videos about it man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and if you can even link to them in a</v>

1421
01:02:51.901 --> 01:02:53.310
<v Speaker 3>reply video,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could say,</v>

1422
01:02:53.570 --> 01:02:56.430
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck face made a reply to Tj and you</v>

1423
01:02:56.431 --> 01:02:57.690
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is what I think about you and your</v>

1424
01:02:57.691 --> 01:03:00.420
<v Speaker 3>fucking shitty atheists ideas and when</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus does come back,</v>

1425
01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:02.280
<v Speaker 3>make a video man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>make a video.</v>

1426
01:03:02.520 --> 01:03:06.350
<v Speaker 3>And that's the interesting thing about</v>
<v Speaker 3>today is that someone can do that.</v>

1427
01:03:06.360 --> 01:03:08.040
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the problem is they try and no one</v>

1428
01:03:08.041 --> 01:03:09.030
<v Speaker 3>cares.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1429
01:03:09.420 --> 01:03:12.540
<v Speaker 3>well it's way easier to critique than it</v>
<v Speaker 3>is to do obviously.</v>

1430
01:03:12.630 --> 01:03:15.510
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very easy to sit there and say</v>

1431
01:03:15.511 --> 01:03:17.250
<v Speaker 3>you're an idiot and everything you do is</v>
<v Speaker 3>wrong.</v>

1432
01:03:17.670 --> 01:03:20.670
<v Speaker 3>To actually do what I do and be</v>
<v Speaker 3>successful at it,</v>

1433
01:03:21.220 --> 01:03:23.790
<v Speaker 3>it's a little harder.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The problem is like to really critique</v>

1434
01:03:23.791 --> 01:03:25.410
<v Speaker 3>someone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If someone's critiquing someone,</v>

1435
01:03:25.411 --> 01:03:29.910
<v Speaker 3>I can read their words and I can try to</v>
<v Speaker 3>think if make it make sense to me and it</v>

1436
01:03:29.911 --> 01:03:33.060
<v Speaker 3>might make sense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't know them and that is,</v>

1437
01:03:33.120 --> 01:03:37.380
<v Speaker 3>that is a problem because if I don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>know them or I don't know their work,</v>

1438
01:03:37.430 --> 01:03:41.430
<v Speaker 3>like if they're an artist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I say Michael Stipe or someone like</v>

1439
01:03:41.431 --> 01:03:44.430
<v Speaker 3>that from rem writes something about</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone,</v>

1440
01:03:44.431 --> 01:03:45.264
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hmm,</v>

1441
01:03:45.330 --> 01:03:48.030
<v Speaker 3>well he seems to be a weird,</v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting Kinda guy.</v>

1442
01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:51.000
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if I would agree with his</v>
<v Speaker 3>opinions on things and wonder if his</v>

1443
01:03:51.001 --> 01:03:52.200
<v Speaker 3>perspective is skewed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

1444
01:03:52.201 --> 01:03:55.470
<v Speaker 3>What does it do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>His words represent honesty or is there</v>

1445
01:03:55.471 --> 01:03:58.380
<v Speaker 3>some sort of emotional imbalance that</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a who?</v>

1446
01:03:58.430 --> 01:03:59.250
<v Speaker 3>What is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what does that,</v>

1447
01:03:59.250 --> 01:04:01.920
<v Speaker 3>what is actually going on?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Unless you know someone,</v>

1448
01:04:02.070 --> 01:04:03.080
<v Speaker 3>it's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

1449
01:04:03.110 --> 01:04:06.060
<v Speaker 3>Like why is he getting mad at the</v>
<v Speaker 3>amazing atheist?</v>

1450
01:04:06.090 --> 01:04:08.880
<v Speaker 3>What is what's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which I wish more people would think</v>

1451
01:04:08.881 --> 01:04:11.190
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1452
01:04:11.191 --> 01:04:13.290
<v Speaker 3>why is he so angry at you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

1453
01:04:13.291 --> 01:04:15.340
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why is he threatening you?</v>

1454
01:04:15.341 --> 01:04:19.440
<v Speaker 3>Why you freak out?</v>
<v Speaker 3>People don't get mad about ideas that</v>

1455
01:04:19.441 --> 01:04:21.900
<v Speaker 3>they think are wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They get afraid of ideas they think</v>

1456
01:04:21.901 --> 01:04:23.700
<v Speaker 3>might be right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a big part of it.</v>

1457
01:04:23.701 --> 01:04:24.090
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1458
01:04:24.090 --> 01:04:25.980
<v Speaker 3>and when you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I'm someone who will come out there</v>

1459
01:04:25.981 --> 01:04:30.540
<v Speaker 3>and just brazenly say that someone's</v>
<v Speaker 3>most deeply cherished beliefs are just</v>

1460
01:04:30.541 --> 01:04:32.700
<v Speaker 3>wrong and stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1461
01:04:32.701 --> 01:04:33.900
<v Speaker 3>of course people are getting upset.</v>

1462
01:04:34.230 --> 01:04:35.850
<v Speaker 3>Of course people are going to have the</v>
<v Speaker 3>reaction of,</v>

1463
01:04:35.851 --> 01:04:37.050
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy,</v>

1464
01:04:37.290 --> 01:04:38.850
<v Speaker 3>he's obnoxious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's an asshole.</v>

1465
01:04:38.851 --> 01:04:40.500
<v Speaker 3>He's an idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which all might be true,</v>

1466
01:04:40.770 --> 01:04:44.040
<v Speaker 3>but I still don't think there's a god.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1467
01:04:44.490 --> 01:04:48.000
<v Speaker 3>do you think there's no god or do not</v>
<v Speaker 3>believe in God?</v>

1468
01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:49.410
<v Speaker 3>I don't think we even got.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1469
01:04:49.411 --> 01:04:50.910
<v Speaker 3>I think there's a difference.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1470
01:04:51.110 --> 01:04:55.650
<v Speaker 3>So you don't have a thing and let people</v>
<v Speaker 3>go with WHO's not you fucking more.</v>

1471
01:04:55.651 --> 01:04:56.760
<v Speaker 3>You're atheist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bullshit.</v>

1472
01:04:56.930 --> 01:04:59.250
<v Speaker 3>Let's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's just follow me for a second here.</v>

1473
01:04:59.460 --> 01:05:02.640
<v Speaker 3>I think there's one thing if you believe</v>
<v Speaker 3>in God,</v>

1474
01:05:02.760 --> 01:05:04.170
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you believe in God,</v>

1475
01:05:04.171 --> 01:05:06.190
<v Speaker 3>you are essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

1476
01:05:06.230 --> 01:05:08.580
<v Speaker 3>you're believing in something that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>have no evidence of.</v>

1477
01:05:08.700 --> 01:05:11.250
<v Speaker 3>There's no proof of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no direction that points to it.</v>

1478
01:05:11.460 --> 01:05:13.860
<v Speaker 3>There's certainly some weird stuff going</v>
<v Speaker 3>on in the universe.</v>

1479
01:05:13.950 --> 01:05:17.590
<v Speaker 3>The Universe is fascinating,</v>
<v Speaker 3>matter itself is a wonderful.</v>

1480
01:05:17.590 --> 01:05:19.090
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's incredible,</v>

1481
01:05:19.200 --> 01:05:22.000
<v Speaker 3>incomprehensible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>incomprehensible and infinite,</v>

1482
01:05:22.030 --> 01:05:26.410
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But believing in something that you have</v>

1483
01:05:26.411 --> 01:05:30.460
<v Speaker 3>no evidence is very different than not</v>
<v Speaker 3>believing in something because when you</v>

1484
01:05:30.461 --> 01:05:33.910
<v Speaker 3>say you don't believe in God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't mean that there's no god,</v>

1485
01:05:34.570 --> 01:05:36.430
<v Speaker 3>but there's no evidence of it</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatsoever.</v>

1486
01:05:36.431 --> 01:05:40.900
<v Speaker 3>I've never seen anything like if you and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I die and we're in heaven and I'm like,</v>

1487
01:05:40.901 --> 01:05:42.580
<v Speaker 3>Tj,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can you fucking believe this shit?</v>

1488
01:05:42.581 --> 01:05:43.810
<v Speaker 3>Be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit,</v>

1489
01:05:45.160 --> 01:05:47.290
<v Speaker 3>we were so stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>High Five,</v>

1490
01:05:47.590 --> 01:05:48.430
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1491
01:05:48.880 --> 01:05:52.960
<v Speaker 3>if there is a wonderful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>beautiful God that's all about love and</v>

1492
01:05:52.961 --> 01:05:54.070
<v Speaker 3>created the universe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>

1493
01:05:54.220 --> 01:05:57.190
<v Speaker 3>he's going to know that you didn't know</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he's not going to be mad at you.</v>

1494
01:05:57.280 --> 01:05:59.350
<v Speaker 3>That's like a friend not knowing when</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're.</v>

1495
01:05:59.351 --> 01:06:02.170
<v Speaker 3>You don't know where they're from.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't know when their birthday is,</v>

1496
01:06:02.350 --> 01:06:05.320
<v Speaker 3>so they come over your house and beat</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fuck out of you because you didn't</v>

1497
01:06:05.321 --> 01:06:06.160
<v Speaker 3>say happy birthday.</v>

1498
01:06:06.320 --> 01:06:06.791
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

1499
01:06:06.791 --> 01:06:08.710
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know you didn't tell me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1500
01:06:08.711 --> 01:06:09.410
<v Speaker 3>that's what.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

1501
01:06:09.410 --> 01:06:12.220
<v Speaker 3>By God not being here to tell us all</v>
<v Speaker 3>this stuff.</v>

1502
01:06:12.890 --> 01:06:16.080
<v Speaker 3>Most people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most people think that God is a is a</v>

1503
01:06:16.090 --> 01:06:16.781
<v Speaker 3>dick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1504
01:06:16.781 --> 01:06:19.540
<v Speaker 3>most people who believe in God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they called themselves God fearing,</v>

1505
01:06:19.541 --> 01:06:20.374
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't.</v>

1506
01:06:20.650 --> 01:06:22.690
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure there are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are people who preach about a god</v>

1507
01:06:22.691 --> 01:06:24.430
<v Speaker 3>of love and forgiveness and all this</v>
<v Speaker 3>shit,</v>

1508
01:06:24.431 --> 01:06:28.840
<v Speaker 3>but most of these people preach about a</v>
<v Speaker 3>God that expects you to blindly believe</v>

1509
01:06:28.841 --> 01:06:33.340
<v Speaker 3>in him or suffer eternal torment forever</v>
<v Speaker 3>in hell and be tortured.</v>

1510
01:06:33.640 --> 01:06:36.310
<v Speaker 3>It's nonsense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we don't know what happens when we</v>

1511
01:06:36.311 --> 01:06:38.320
<v Speaker 3>die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really that simple.</v>

1512
01:06:38.321 --> 01:06:43.321
<v Speaker 3>It could be just like a DMT trip.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It could be like a completely new DMT is</v>

1513
01:06:43.601 --> 01:06:46.040
<v Speaker 3>released in the brain when people die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1514
01:06:46.120 --> 01:06:48.910
<v Speaker 3>During moments of heavy stress when your</v>
<v Speaker 3>body feels like it's going to die.</v>

1515
01:06:49.190 --> 01:06:50.220
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we,</v>

1516
01:06:50.221 --> 01:06:52.420
<v Speaker 3>we even know now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thanks to the work of this guy,</v>

1517
01:06:52.450 --> 01:06:56.380
<v Speaker 3>Dr Rick Strassman who wrote that book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the spirit molecule spirit molecule.</v>

1518
01:06:56.410 --> 01:06:57.880
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He wrote,</v>

1519
01:06:58.520 --> 01:07:01.000
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they did these clinical trials out of</v>

1520
01:07:01.001 --> 01:07:03.460
<v Speaker 3>the University of New Mexico and he</v>
<v Speaker 3>documented it in this book or they're</v>

1521
01:07:03.461 --> 01:07:07.000
<v Speaker 3>administering DMT intravenously,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really fucking wild shit.</v>

1522
01:07:07.300 --> 01:07:10.110
<v Speaker 3>But he's got this thing called the</v>
<v Speaker 3>cottonwood research foundation where</v>

1523
01:07:10.111 --> 01:07:15.111
<v Speaker 3>they're trying to do more dmt studies</v>
<v Speaker 3>and one of the things they've found is</v>

1524
01:07:15.431 --> 01:07:20.431
<v Speaker 3>that they've isolated one of these</v>
<v Speaker 3>universities that mice produce dmt in</v>

1525
01:07:20.891 --> 01:07:24.580
<v Speaker 3>their pineal gland.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that is a fact now.</v>

1526
01:07:24.730 --> 01:07:27.520
<v Speaker 3>Whereas before it was just anecdotal</v>
<v Speaker 3>evidence that pointed to that.</v>

1527
01:07:27.760 --> 01:07:30.070
<v Speaker 3>So like the seed of the soul,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the third,</v>

1528
01:07:30.071 --> 01:07:31.650
<v Speaker 3>I like all that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the,</v>

1529
01:07:31.670 --> 01:07:35.230
<v Speaker 3>this gland in the center of your brain</v>
<v Speaker 3>really is the DMT factory,</v>

1530
01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:38.320
<v Speaker 3>which is what you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ancient people have been saying forever.</v>

1531
01:07:38.320 --> 01:07:40.510
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's the third eye from eastern</v>
<v Speaker 3>mysticism.</v>

1532
01:07:40.511 --> 01:07:42.220
<v Speaker 3>That is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what it represents.</v>

1533
01:07:42.700 --> 01:07:47.700
<v Speaker 3>So that is supposedly what we release</v>
<v Speaker 3>our brain releases when we die,</v>

1534
01:07:48.220 --> 01:07:52.180
<v Speaker 3>which is really amazing if you stop and</v>
<v Speaker 3>think about it or if you've had a dmt</v>

1535
01:07:52.181 --> 01:07:54.350
<v Speaker 3>trip,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it might not even be that about</v>

1536
01:07:54.370 --> 01:07:56.800
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That might be just the doorway that gets</v>

1537
01:07:56.801 --> 01:08:00.280
<v Speaker 3>you to diapers and all of a sudden you</v>
<v Speaker 3>wake up and you're a fucking baby again.</v>

1538
01:08:00.281 --> 01:08:03.670
<v Speaker 3>You got to do this shit all over again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got to live as Tj and you've got to</v>

1539
01:08:03.671 --> 01:08:06.880
<v Speaker 3>do the same fucking life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your parents make the same moves.</v>

1540
01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.190
<v Speaker 3>Your Dad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mom gets a voice at the same time.</v>

1541
01:08:09.191 --> 01:08:11.330
<v Speaker 3>This,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is like a Nietzschean ideal of</v>

1542
01:08:11.710 --> 01:08:14.380
<v Speaker 3>eternal recurrence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why not?</v>

1543
01:08:14.520 --> 01:08:15.940
<v Speaker 3>If existence kid</v>

1544
01:08:16.010 --> 01:08:18.500
<v Speaker 1>can be real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the hold on a second,</v>

1545
01:08:18.501 --> 01:08:23.150
<v Speaker 1>if these actual distance of us talking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sitting here know airplanes landing,</v>

1546
01:08:23.151 --> 01:08:26.270
<v Speaker 1>all these things take place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why can't it take place in an infinite</v>

1547
01:08:26.271 --> 01:08:27.440
<v Speaker 1>number of times?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could,</v>

1548
01:08:27.470 --> 01:08:28.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's kind of,</v>

1549
01:08:28.760 --> 01:08:31.190
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the one of the most compelling arguments</v>

1550
01:08:31.191 --> 01:08:34.640
<v Speaker 1>to live an interesting life if you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to have to actually go through it</v>

1551
01:08:34.641 --> 01:08:39.530
<v Speaker 1>over and over and over again in exactly</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same fashion with nothing different</v>

1552
01:08:39.830 --> 01:08:42.050
<v Speaker 1>or not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe you do get to change,</v>

1553
01:08:42.051 --> 01:08:44.480
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that concept of living the same life</v>

1554
01:08:44.481 --> 01:08:47.660
<v Speaker 1>over and over again is um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's been around a long time.</v>

1555
01:08:47.661 --> 01:08:49.880
<v Speaker 1>But actually a word for it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>full disclosure though,</v>

1556
01:08:49.881 --> 01:08:52.220
<v Speaker 1>my belief is generally that when I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I'm dead,</v>

1557
01:08:52.221 --> 01:08:54.860
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to blink out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>existence.</v>

1558
01:08:54.890 --> 01:08:55.910
<v Speaker 1>But why do you believe that?</v>

1559
01:08:56.450 --> 01:08:59.000
<v Speaker 1>I just don't understand you believing</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you don't have any information,</v>

1560
01:08:59.300 --> 01:09:01.310
<v Speaker 1>but I couldn't understand you believe in</v>
<v Speaker 1>result.</v>

1561
01:09:01.340 --> 01:09:05.090
<v Speaker 1>The reason I believe that is because I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think that my consciousness has seated</v>

1562
01:09:05.091 --> 01:09:10.091
<v Speaker 1>within my brain and that my brain is</v>
<v Speaker 1>unique to this time and place,</v>

1563
01:09:11.361 --> 01:09:14.570
<v Speaker 1>and that even if it were to be recreated</v>
<v Speaker 1>identically,</v>

1564
01:09:15.350 --> 01:09:16.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right next to me,</v>

1565
01:09:16.461 --> 01:09:18.200
<v Speaker 1>that still wouldn't be me because</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

1566
01:09:18.220 --> 01:09:21.230
<v Speaker 1>there's still a separation there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not a clone of yourself.</v>

1567
01:09:21.860 --> 01:09:23.180
<v Speaker 1>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1568
01:09:23.181 --> 01:09:24.690
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

1569
01:09:24.700 --> 01:09:27.350
<v Speaker 1>I kind of try to live in the eternal</v>
<v Speaker 1>presence,</v>

1570
01:09:27.380 --> 01:09:28.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

1571
01:09:29.540 --> 01:09:31.290
<v Speaker 1>that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's smart.</v>

1572
01:09:31.680 --> 01:09:33.590
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe.</v>

1573
01:09:33.591 --> 01:09:34.400
<v Speaker 1>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1574
01:09:34.400 --> 01:09:38.540
<v Speaker 1>if you were to pull out a gun and shoot</v>
<v Speaker 1>me in the head that it would be the end</v>

1575
01:09:38.541 --> 01:09:40.730
<v Speaker 1>of my existence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would never form another thought.</v>

1576
01:09:40.731 --> 01:09:42.260
<v Speaker 1>I would never have another experience.</v>

1577
01:09:42.600 --> 01:09:45.350
<v Speaker 1>I can't prove that though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's totally just what I believe.</v>

1578
01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:47.990
<v Speaker 1>It's totally possible that you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1579
01:09:48.230 --> 01:09:53.230
<v Speaker 1>but it's also compelling the idea that</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the brain is is the universe</v>

1580
01:09:54.140 --> 01:09:58.880
<v Speaker 1>finding a way to imagine itself in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>physical three dimensional form.</v>

1581
01:09:59.640 --> 01:10:03.140
<v Speaker 1>That's what the brand represents and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that this dimension that we exist in</v>

1582
01:10:03.141 --> 01:10:07.850
<v Speaker 1>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>solid things is just one of an infinite</v>

1583
01:10:07.851 --> 01:10:12.650
<v Speaker 1>number of possibilities that exist all</v>
<v Speaker 1>throughout the cosmos and that what</v>

1584
01:10:12.651 --> 01:10:17.600
<v Speaker 1>we're experiencing right now is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>body,</v>

1585
01:10:17.750 --> 01:10:22.370
<v Speaker 1>the physical embodiment of life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>multicellular structures coming together</v>

1586
01:10:22.580 --> 01:10:25.820
<v Speaker 1>and forming these coalitions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is essentially what your body is,</v>

1587
01:10:25.821 --> 01:10:27.110
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's all this bacteria and all this</v>

1588
01:10:27.320 --> 01:10:31.100
<v Speaker 1>different shit that's going on and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has to take in life foods and enzymes</v>

1589
01:10:31.101 --> 01:10:36.101
<v Speaker 1>and creates this environment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this in its most advanced form,</v>

1590
01:10:36.920 --> 01:10:40.130
<v Speaker 1>at least as far as its ability to</v>
<v Speaker 1>manipulate your house right now.</v>

1591
01:10:40.610 --> 01:10:42.550
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever heard Howard blooms the</v>
<v Speaker 1>frames or.</v>

1592
01:10:42.560 --> 01:10:43.730
<v Speaker 1>I'll forget it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1593
01:10:43.860 --> 01:10:45.170
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did I say?</v>

1594
01:10:46.010 --> 01:10:47.300
<v Speaker 1>Fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry.</v>

1595
01:10:47.570 --> 01:10:48.080
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1596
01:10:48.080 --> 01:10:52.190
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about a lot of stuff that</v>
<v Speaker 1>my friend Howard Bloom has written about</v>

1597
01:10:52.700 --> 01:10:57.680
<v Speaker 1>in a book he wrote called the global</v>
<v Speaker 1>brain that basically talks about exactly</v>

1598
01:10:57.681 --> 01:11:00.640
<v Speaker 1>that coalescence of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1599
01:11:00.650 --> 01:11:05.100
<v Speaker 1>a single bacteria to a biofilm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bacterial colonies,</v>

1600
01:11:05.600 --> 01:11:08.570
<v Speaker 1>to an organism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to organisms getting together and</v>

1601
01:11:08.571 --> 01:11:10.220
<v Speaker 1>forming societies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1602
01:11:10.221 --> 01:11:11.570
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all about how,</v>

1603
01:11:12.380 --> 01:11:12.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

1604
01:11:12.990 --> 01:11:13.490
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

1605
01:11:13.490 --> 01:11:17.520
<v Speaker 1>we're climbing this ladder of</v>
<v Speaker 1>connectivity and you know,</v>

1606
01:11:18.060 --> 01:11:19.920
<v Speaker 1>like Los Angeles is a good example at</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

1607
01:11:19.921 --> 01:11:24.480
<v Speaker 1>You kind of likened it in a video I saw</v>
<v Speaker 1>of yours to the mold eating the</v>

1608
01:11:24.481 --> 01:11:25.560
<v Speaker 1>sandwich,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1609
01:11:25.790 --> 01:11:27.810
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're kind of that force because</v>

1610
01:11:27.811 --> 01:11:32.811
<v Speaker 1>humanity is like a super organism and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've built this crazy large society</v>

1611
01:11:33.331 --> 01:11:36.510
<v Speaker 1>that no other ape species on the planet</v>
<v Speaker 1>has been able to come close to.</v>

1612
01:11:37.720 --> 01:11:41.730
<v Speaker 1>Well that was the concept was that it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>all moving towards this ultimate goal of</v>

1613
01:11:41.731 --> 01:11:43.380
<v Speaker 1>things being more and more complex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1614
01:11:43.530 --> 01:11:44.610
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while that's happening,</v>

1615
01:11:45.030 --> 01:11:48.090
<v Speaker 1>the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is what the human uses to go</v>

1616
01:11:48.091 --> 01:11:53.091
<v Speaker 1>through this experience could have been</v>
<v Speaker 1>created like over time and through all</v>

1617
01:11:54.481 --> 01:11:57.590
<v Speaker 1>these advancements for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the universal sort of experiencing</v>

1618
01:11:57.600 --> 01:12:01.320
<v Speaker 1>itself for the universe to imagine</v>
<v Speaker 1>itself and what we're doing as these</v>

1619
01:12:01.321 --> 01:12:04.070
<v Speaker 1>weird organisms that changed things as</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

1620
01:12:04.080 --> 01:12:05.700
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're designing something,</v>

1621
01:12:05.701 --> 01:12:09.240
<v Speaker 1>we're building towards something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no question that if things</v>

1622
01:12:09.241 --> 01:12:13.740
<v Speaker 1>continue to get more and more complex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which we are fucking starving for,</v>

1623
01:12:13.980 --> 01:12:16.950
<v Speaker 1>we're constantly thirsty for new</v>
<v Speaker 1>inventions.</v>

1624
01:12:17.070 --> 01:12:19.740
<v Speaker 1>Innovation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what everybody wants and no one</v>

1625
01:12:19.741 --> 01:12:22.410
<v Speaker 1>wants like a static world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one says,</v>

1626
01:12:22.411 --> 01:12:24.210
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything we have right now</v>

1627
01:12:24.211 --> 01:12:27.510
<v Speaker 1>technologically is perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need to stop spending money on</v>

1628
01:12:27.511 --> 01:12:30.060
<v Speaker 1>research and inventions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's just have joy.</v>

1629
01:12:30.060 --> 01:12:32.820
<v Speaker 1>All the shit we have and just be nice to</v>
<v Speaker 1>each other.</v>

1630
01:12:32.850 --> 01:12:34.830
<v Speaker 1>That's not what we're interested in at</v>
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

1631
01:12:35.570 --> 01:12:37.520
<v Speaker 1>But so if you look at us objectively,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you like,</v>

1632
01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:39.960
<v Speaker 1>pull back and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is this thing doing?</v>

1633
01:12:40.290 --> 01:12:44.280
<v Speaker 1>Like what is this thing doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This thing is constantly getting better</v>

1634
01:12:44.281 --> 01:12:49.281
<v Speaker 1>at getting closer together and it by</v>
<v Speaker 1>combining people and electronics,</v>

1635
01:12:50.140 --> 01:12:54.930
<v Speaker 1>combining people and technology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the dinosaurs could have had that</v>

1636
01:12:54.931 --> 01:12:56.550
<v Speaker 1>perspective though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like yeah man,</v>

1637
01:12:56.551 --> 01:12:59.730
<v Speaker 1>we're built into like bigger and better</v>
<v Speaker 1>dinosaurs one day.</v>

1638
01:12:59.731 --> 01:13:03.690
<v Speaker 1>It's just going to be the biggest</v>
<v Speaker 1>ultimate dinosaur that rules the</v>

1639
01:13:03.691 --> 01:13:05.040
<v Speaker 1>universe or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

1640
01:13:05.041 --> 01:13:06.360
<v Speaker 1>Instead they went extinct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1641
01:13:06.361 --> 01:13:09.560
<v Speaker 1>but they got hit with a rock cheating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you fire like it's cheating.</v>

1642
01:13:09.580 --> 01:13:12.810
<v Speaker 1>If you find like a cannon ball,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if it's going up and up and up,</v>

1643
01:13:12.811 --> 01:13:15.930
<v Speaker 1>you might make the mistake of saying</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is always going to go up and up and</v>

1644
01:13:15.931 --> 01:13:16.980
<v Speaker 1>up and then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1645
01:13:17.040 --> 01:13:18.780
<v Speaker 1>eventually gravity catches up with it.</v>

1646
01:13:19.150 --> 01:13:23.340
<v Speaker 1>I just don't think we could take it for</v>
<v Speaker 1>granted that we have some sort of great</v>

1647
01:13:23.341 --> 01:13:25.710
<v Speaker 1>destiny on the horizon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

1648
01:13:25.711 --> 01:13:27.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's up to us to make that happen,</v>

1649
01:13:27.780 --> 01:13:29.430
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think we can take it for</v>
<v Speaker 1>granted.</v>

1650
01:13:29.670 --> 01:13:30.420
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely not.</v>

1651
01:13:30.420 --> 01:13:32.800
<v Speaker 1>No one's suggesting that definitely</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't.</v>

1652
01:13:33.300 --> 01:13:35.280
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it has to work out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

1653
01:13:35.490 --> 01:13:38.190
<v Speaker 1>here's a fucking gigantic super volcano</v>
<v Speaker 1>under yellowstone.</v>

1654
01:13:38.420 --> 01:13:42.270
<v Speaker 1>Could easily blow up and killed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Basically everybody on the continent as</v>

1655
01:13:42.420 --> 01:13:44.880
<v Speaker 1>close to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That fucker blows.</v>

1656
01:13:45.060 --> 01:13:47.350
<v Speaker 1>This is a global extinction event.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this,</v>

1657
01:13:47.351 --> 01:13:49.320
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could they think that that one that blue</v>

1658
01:13:49.321 --> 01:13:54.321
<v Speaker 1>was at in Indonesia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chop the human race down to just a few</v>

1659
01:13:54.390 --> 01:13:57.060
<v Speaker 1>thousand people 70,000 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They think it might have been as few as</v>

1660
01:13:57.061 --> 01:13:58.350
<v Speaker 1>2000 people left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1661
01:13:58.351 --> 01:14:01.560
<v Speaker 1>the real detriment is the clouds</v>
<v Speaker 1>blocking out the sun.</v>

1662
01:14:01.590 --> 01:14:02.880
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lack of food.</v>

1663
01:14:03.330 --> 01:14:05.370
<v Speaker 1>Photosynthesis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No vegetables,</v>

1664
01:14:05.371 --> 01:14:08.070
<v Speaker 1>fucking serious climate change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

1665
01:14:08.071 --> 01:14:09.140
<v Speaker 1>very drastic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

1666
01:14:09.141 --> 01:14:11.220
<v Speaker 1>very cold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>real cold,</v>

1667
01:14:11.230 --> 01:14:14.020
<v Speaker 1>real quick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no food and a lot of people are going to</v>

1668
01:14:14.021 --> 01:14:15.280
<v Speaker 1>die of sickness and illness.</v>

1669
01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:17.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a super volcano.</v>

1670
01:14:17.831 --> 01:14:20.800
<v Speaker 1>Could fuck up everything and then that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>the argument that a lot of people have</v>

1671
01:14:20.801 --> 01:14:25.180
<v Speaker 1>made as far as people that have looked</v>
<v Speaker 1>to try to revise those current model of</v>

1672
01:14:25.181 --> 01:14:28.660
<v Speaker 1>history based on cataclysmic events like</v>
<v Speaker 1>look back and say,</v>

1673
01:14:28.661 --> 01:14:29.201
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1674
01:14:29.201 --> 01:14:31.660
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of these cultures that</v>
<v Speaker 1>created these incredible stone</v>

1675
01:14:31.661 --> 01:14:34.480
<v Speaker 1>structures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like maybe they died off because some</v>

1676
01:14:34.481 --> 01:14:37.660
<v Speaker 1>shit happened like he couldn't get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might not have just been disease.</v>

1677
01:14:37.661 --> 01:14:40.660
<v Speaker 1>There might be like a series of media</v>
<v Speaker 1>impacts.</v>

1678
01:14:40.740 --> 01:14:42.880
<v Speaker 1>Super volcanoes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all sorts of different.</v>

1679
01:14:43.570 --> 01:14:46.960
<v Speaker 1>There's like shit that can happen to</v>
<v Speaker 1>this world all the time.</v>

1680
01:14:47.100 --> 01:14:49.720
<v Speaker 1>California is due for an earthquake at</v>
<v Speaker 1>any moment.</v>

1681
01:14:50.100 --> 01:14:53.950
<v Speaker 1>This we can be sitting here doing this</v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast and any moment a nine kid hit</v>

1682
01:14:54.100 --> 01:14:59.080
<v Speaker 1>and half a fucking Malibu could slide</v>
<v Speaker 1>right into the ocean and waves a hundred</v>

1683
01:14:59.080 --> 01:15:01.660
<v Speaker 1>feet high can just roll three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>four miles in.</v>

1684
01:15:01.810 --> 01:15:03.550
<v Speaker 1>At least.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'd be an interesting episode.</v>

1685
01:15:04.150 --> 01:15:06.160
<v Speaker 1>It would be a dope podcasts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think,</v>

1686
01:15:06.280 --> 01:15:07.780
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we figured we need a battery.</v>

1687
01:15:08.200 --> 01:15:11.230
<v Speaker 1>Joe Rogan goes screaming into the abyss</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the earth.</v>

1688
01:15:11.260 --> 01:15:14.290
<v Speaker 1>We need a battery backup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're strategically far away from the,</v>

1689
01:15:14.291 --> 01:15:16.250
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the ocean for that reason.</v>

1690
01:15:16.251 --> 01:15:16.750
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're saying,</v>

1691
01:15:16.750 --> 01:15:18.040
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've thought of this.</v>

1692
01:15:18.041 --> 01:15:20.320
<v Speaker 1>You've planned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had been thinking about setting up</v>

1693
01:15:20.321 --> 01:15:21.760
<v Speaker 1>shop in downtown La.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

1694
01:15:21.761 --> 01:15:26.050
<v Speaker 1>I have this weird compelling notion to</v>
<v Speaker 1>try to get to downtown La and set</v>

1695
01:15:26.051 --> 01:15:28.900
<v Speaker 1>something up in there like put,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put together a studio in downtown.</v>

1696
01:15:29.170 --> 01:15:31.090
<v Speaker 1>It just seems like a spot to go to right</v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

1697
01:15:31.210 --> 01:15:35.050
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm drawn to it like the ring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'm saying?</v>

1698
01:15:35.080 --> 01:15:36.210
<v Speaker 1>Ring of power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1699
01:15:36.520 --> 01:15:39.280
<v Speaker 1>Well which are on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was using it for</v>

1700
01:15:42.460 --> 01:15:43.360
<v Speaker 1>something about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1701
01:15:43.390 --> 01:15:46.060
<v Speaker 1>going there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's a high enough to have a good</v>

1702
01:15:46.061 --> 01:15:49.810
<v Speaker 1>vantage point to see the waves come in</v>
<v Speaker 1>and know that you can't get it out of</v>

1703
01:15:49.811 --> 01:15:50.560
<v Speaker 1>the way.</v>

1704
01:15:50.560 --> 01:15:52.840
<v Speaker 1>And I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't plan for stuff like that.</v>

1705
01:15:52.841 --> 01:15:54.310
<v Speaker 1>I figured if I'm gonna die,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna die.</v>

1706
01:15:54.311 --> 01:15:59.311
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to try to avert some</v>
<v Speaker 1>unlikely fate of the tsunami waves.</v>

1707
01:16:00.311 --> 01:16:00.701
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1708
01:16:00.701 --> 01:16:02.320
<v Speaker 1>I figured like if that's what's going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>kill me,</v>

1709
01:16:02.620 --> 01:16:04.960
<v Speaker 1>I'll just stand out there and I'll look</v>
<v Speaker 1>at them and I'll be like,</v>

1710
01:16:04.990 --> 01:16:06.610
<v Speaker 1>alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>embrace me.</v>

1711
01:16:06.650 --> 01:16:07.780
<v Speaker 1>Death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1712
01:16:07.781 --> 01:16:10.180
<v Speaker 1>Like the final scene of deep impact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1713
01:16:10.181 --> 01:16:11.690
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just fucking like.</v>

1714

<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>the people that are free are the people</v>

1720
01:16:25.871 --> 01:16:28.630

<v Speaker 1>The people that are trapped in this</v>

1721
01:16:28.631 --> 01:16:31.510
<v Speaker 1>shitty world surrounded by flesh eating</v>
<v Speaker 1>monsters.</v>

1722
01:16:31.810 --> 01:16:33.310
<v Speaker 1>Those are the people that are alive.</v>

1723
01:16:33.370 --> 01:16:35.920
<v Speaker 1>The of live fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why they did that whole like play</v>

1724
01:16:35.921 --> 01:16:37.750
<v Speaker 1>on words with that one episode where</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

1725
01:16:37.751 --> 01:16:39.610
<v Speaker 1>we are the walking dead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1726
01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.850
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see a twisted it around.</v>

1727
01:16:42.860 --> 01:16:47.150
<v Speaker 1>Subverted expectation was fleshed out</v>
<v Speaker 1>that no,</v>

1728
01:16:47.290 --> 01:16:48.970
<v Speaker 1>I pretended it didn't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It happened.</v>

1729
01:16:49.030 --> 01:16:51.370
<v Speaker 1>It was beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you watch the new walking dead?</v>

1730
01:16:51.460 --> 01:16:52.870
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really fucking good.</v>

1731
01:16:52.900 --> 01:16:55.930
<v Speaker 1>Is it because I heard bad things?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How dare those people?</v>

1732
01:16:55.931 --> 01:16:58.090
<v Speaker 1>Those people suck and those people don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>know shit.</v>

1733
01:16:58.990 --> 01:17:02.830
<v Speaker 1>I'm addicted to that show and I know</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sometimes it's pretty hokey and</v>

1734
01:17:02.831 --> 01:17:04.360
<v Speaker 1>cheesy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I do like it.</v>

1735
01:17:04.660 --> 01:17:06.070
<v Speaker 1>I like it too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I liked both of them,</v>

1736
01:17:06.610 --> 01:17:10.700
<v Speaker 1>but the new one is way more like a movie</v>
<v Speaker 1>or way more like maybe a netflix show.</v>

1737
01:17:10.880 --> 01:17:13.670
<v Speaker 1>Whereas the old ones seems like an NBC</v>
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>

1738
01:17:13.960 --> 01:17:15.890
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love about the walking dead is that</v>

1739
01:17:16.040 --> 01:17:18.380
<v Speaker 1>every episode is just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

1740
01:17:18.380 --> 01:17:21.240
<v Speaker 1>Miserable Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're all characters go through next and</v>

1741
01:17:21.241 --> 01:17:23.840
<v Speaker 1>then it's just like misery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>executive object,</v>

1742
01:17:23.841 --> 01:17:25.340
<v Speaker 1>fucking horror,</v>
<v Speaker 1>terror.</v>

1743
01:17:25.341 --> 01:17:27.860
<v Speaker 1>Just no moment of goodness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And even if there is,</v>

1744
01:17:27.861 --> 01:17:30.300
<v Speaker 1>it's just so it can be taken away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1745
01:17:30.950 --> 01:17:32.660
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that kind of makes people feel better</v>

1746
01:17:32.661 --> 01:17:34.250
<v Speaker 1>about their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their actual lives I think.</v>

1747
01:17:34.251 --> 01:17:37.940
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of the sjw types around</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Internet need to get into that show.</v>

1748
01:17:37.941 --> 01:17:42.941
<v Speaker 1>So people who have a real life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a social justice warrior.</v>

1749
01:17:43.160 --> 01:17:47.170
<v Speaker 1>It's what he's referring to when he says</v>
<v Speaker 1>asj w dot m r a.</v>

1750
01:17:47.180 --> 01:17:49.520
<v Speaker 1>that's not one said really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyone on the Internet knows what I'm</v>

1751
01:17:49.521 --> 01:17:51.680
<v Speaker 1>talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a lot of people that are not</v>

1752
01:17:51.681 --> 01:17:53.300
<v Speaker 1>on the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just getting this podcast.</v>

1753
01:17:53.301 --> 01:17:54.740
<v Speaker 1>We have to help them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lucky them.</v>

1754
01:17:54.800 --> 01:17:55.830
<v Speaker 1>We have to help them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want it.</v>

1755
01:17:55.900 --> 01:17:59.900
<v Speaker 1>If they don't know what a fucking sjws</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't do them the disservice of telling</v>

1756
01:17:59.901 --> 01:18:02.960
<v Speaker 1>them what you said Mra earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which allowed people's rights,</v>

1757
01:18:02.961 --> 01:18:04.910
<v Speaker 1>activist or advocate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1758
01:18:05.260 --> 01:18:07.240
<v Speaker 1>I guess it can be advocate to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've always heard activists,</v>

1759
01:18:07.300 --> 01:18:12.050
<v Speaker 1>but it basically means like men are</v>
<v Speaker 1>oppressed in America.</v>

1760
01:18:12.051 --> 01:18:13.640
<v Speaker 1>It's both.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1761
01:18:13.700 --> 01:18:15.260
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shut up.</v>

1762
01:18:16.820 --> 01:18:19.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a good position to be in,</v>

1763
01:18:20.480 --> 01:18:21.313
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

1764
01:18:22.260 --> 01:18:23.093
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

1765
01:18:23.340 --> 01:18:25.360
<v Speaker 1>we discussed their valid thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's easy.</v>

1766
01:18:25.430 --> 01:18:28.530
<v Speaker 1>It's easy to mock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's easy to mock it up.</v>

1767
01:18:28.790 --> 01:18:29.850
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what that was,</v>

1768
01:18:29.880 --> 01:18:30.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1769
01:18:30.550 --> 01:18:32.400

<v Speaker 1>my whole point was like,</v>

1770
01:18:32.430 --> 01:18:37.170
<v Speaker 1>a men's rights activist would want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>support you when you were being sexually</v>

1771
01:18:37.171 --> 01:18:39.630
<v Speaker 1>harassed by that super horny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you're right.</v>

1772
01:18:39.780 --> 01:18:42.390
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I'm biting the hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They should potentially feed.</v>

1773
01:18:42.391 --> 01:18:44.220
<v Speaker 1>Called a couple friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Had A fucking gang.</v>

01:18:44.221 --> 01:18:45.360
<v Speaker 1>Bang.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That crazy bitch.</v>

1775
01:18:45.390 --> 01:18:46.680

<v Speaker 1>connected with rubber bands for some</v>

1779
01:18:55.291 --> 01:18:57.630
<v Speaker 1>reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is that hot when they have the</v>

1780
01:18:57.631 --> 01:19:00.630
<v Speaker 1>stocking and it's got like strap and</v>

<v Speaker 1>Things would have played out</v>
<v Speaker 1>differently.</v>

1829
01:20:49.471 --> 01:20:51.780
<v Speaker 1>Totally different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just not in the blank checks,</v>

1830
01:20:51.781 --> 01:20:53.580
<v Speaker 1>but that's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am now.</v>

1831
01:20:53.581 --> 01:20:54.870
<v Speaker 1>Just not then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1832
01:20:54.871 --> 01:20:55.770
<v Speaker 1>you know what man?</v>

1833
01:20:55.860 --> 01:20:59.790
<v Speaker 1>Why is it a bad thing to not be sexually</v>
<v Speaker 1>into whatever.</v>

1834
01:20:59.940 --> 01:21:02.430
<v Speaker 1>I don't like meat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it'd be like you don't like skinny</v>

1835
01:21:02.431 --> 01:21:04.020
<v Speaker 1>women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't like tall women.</v>

1836
01:21:04.140 --> 01:21:06.060
<v Speaker 1>You don't like short.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a preference issue.</v>

1837
01:21:06.061 --> 01:21:10.680
<v Speaker 1>Like are you allowed to say sexually you</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not attracted to black women or a</v>

1838
01:21:10.681 --> 01:21:12.630
<v Speaker 1>black man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you allowed to say that or is that</v>

1839
01:21:12.631 --> 01:21:14.040
<v Speaker 1>racist?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's racist.</v>

1840
01:21:14.160 --> 01:21:15.810
<v Speaker 1>That's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's considered racist.</v>

1841
01:21:15.850 --> 01:21:20.160
<v Speaker 1>It's only about sex as a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're a lover as a human being.</v>

1842
01:21:20.161 --> 01:21:24.300
<v Speaker 1>If you go to the SJ W,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which our audiences just learned what</v>

1843
01:21:24.301 --> 01:21:25.740
<v Speaker 1>that means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>circles,</v>

1844
01:21:26.310 --> 01:21:30.870
<v Speaker 1>then it's racist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're in the MRA circles than it's</v>

1845
01:21:30.900 --> 01:21:33.870
<v Speaker 1>not so raised,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I'm on their side now among them</v>

1846
01:21:33.900 --> 01:21:37.710
<v Speaker 1>that I will admit it's easier to take</v>
<v Speaker 1>their side,</v>

1847
01:21:37.770 --> 01:21:40.470
<v Speaker 1>but I still just think there's too much</v>
<v Speaker 1>of this.</v>

1848
01:21:41.040 --> 01:21:43.080
<v Speaker 1>I'm a victim.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Feel sorry for me.</v>

1849
01:21:43.080 --> 01:21:45.240
<v Speaker 1>Give me special rights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Give me special privileges.</v>

1850
01:21:45.241 --> 01:21:47.880
<v Speaker 1>I just tired of that line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1851
01:21:47.881 --> 01:21:50.160
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we had people that were oppressed groups</v>

1852
01:21:50.161 --> 01:21:52.350
<v Speaker 1>in America for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one denies it,</v>

1853
01:21:52.770 --> 01:21:54.060
<v Speaker 1>but I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that really still the case?</v>

1854
01:21:54.061 --> 01:21:56.270
<v Speaker 1>Like she'll give me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always asked feminists,</v>

1855
01:21:56.271 --> 01:21:59.190
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell me an objective objectively</v>

1856
01:21:59.191 --> 01:22:00.600
<v Speaker 1>provable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1857
01:22:00.960 --> 01:22:03.990
<v Speaker 1>Give me a right that I have that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have.</v>

1858
01:22:03.991 --> 01:22:05.790
<v Speaker 1>And it's just silence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1859
01:22:06.290 --> 01:22:07.610
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1860
01:22:08.020 --> 01:22:10.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1861
01:22:10.380 --> 01:22:12.780
<v Speaker 1>what about the wage gap?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wage gap.</v>

1862
01:22:12.810 --> 01:22:13.860
<v Speaker 1>There's no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no right.</v>

1863
01:22:13.870 --> 01:22:17.880
<v Speaker 1>There's lots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but don't just don't remember though.</v>

1864
01:22:17.881 --> 01:22:19.410
<v Speaker 1>Like there was a wage gap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1865
01:22:19.411 --> 01:22:23.220
<v Speaker 1>you already know this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody wrote this down and just don't</v>

1866
01:22:23.250 --> 01:22:25.080
<v Speaker 1>say it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The wage gap is real.</v>

1867
01:22:25.081 --> 01:22:25.914
<v Speaker 1>Guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just</v>

1868
01:22:27.930 --> 01:22:29.720
<v Speaker 1>stop that space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>

1869
01:22:29.790 --> 01:22:31.800
<v Speaker 1>Can't argue with those facts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've done some research,</v>

1870
01:22:31.801 --> 01:22:36.801
<v Speaker 1>I've discovered that in certain</v>
<v Speaker 1>industries there are wage gaps,</v>

1871
01:22:37.140 --> 01:22:39.480
<v Speaker 1>there are individual wage gaps in</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain industries.</v>

1872
01:22:39.480 --> 01:22:42.690
<v Speaker 1>Like what industries are our primary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember off the top of my head.</v>

1873
01:22:42.691 --> 01:22:44.580
<v Speaker 1>I think a real estate and stuff like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1874
01:22:44.581 --> 01:22:48.590
<v Speaker 1>but I mean that could in real estate's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>weird one though because it kind of</v>

1875
01:22:48.600 --> 01:22:51.880
<v Speaker 1>depends on how successful you are at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1876
01:22:51.881 --> 01:22:53.850
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not like you're going in and doing</v>

1877
01:22:53.851 --> 01:22:55.950
<v Speaker 1>a nine to five and get into fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>salary.</v>

1878
01:22:56.280 --> 01:23:00.390
<v Speaker 1>I know a dude who bought a house and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>girl who was selling the house was hot</v>

1879
01:23:00.630 --> 01:23:04.440
<v Speaker 1>and he was a single guy and he showed up</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the house and this bitch was in the</v>

1880
01:23:04.470 --> 01:23:06.040
<v Speaker 1>tub naked.</v>

1881
01:23:06.910 --> 01:23:09.760
<v Speaker 3>That's one way to sell a house.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There used to be able to do that in the</v>

1882
01:23:09.761 --> 01:23:12.880
<v Speaker 3>early two thousands.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My friend for fucking social media</v>

1883
01:23:12.881 --> 01:23:14.250
<v Speaker 3>ruined that party.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1884
01:23:14.260 --> 01:23:17.170
<v Speaker 3>he'll blow her shit on facebook and ruin</v>
<v Speaker 3>her life.</v>

1885
01:23:17.560 --> 01:23:19.510
<v Speaker 3>She's just trying to get freaky and sell</v>
<v Speaker 3>a house.</v>

1886
01:23:19.511 --> 01:23:21.910
<v Speaker 3>Maybe get some Dick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>catch some of that loose dick.</v>

1887
01:23:21.920 --> 01:23:24.580
<v Speaker 3>This float around when you're a hot real</v>
<v Speaker 3>estate agent,</v>

1888
01:23:26.380 --> 01:23:29.620
<v Speaker 3>why not?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to share levels or no bubbles.</v>

1889
01:23:29.621 --> 01:23:32.950
<v Speaker 3>I envisioned bubbles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bubbles is bubbles is the move.</v>

1890
01:23:33.070 --> 01:23:34.810
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's pretty gangster to go fucking</v>

1891
01:23:34.811 --> 01:23:35.644
<v Speaker 3>straight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>naked.</v>

1892
01:23:36.270 --> 01:23:39.220
<v Speaker 3>Clear in native.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's better if there's bubbles</v>

1893
01:23:39.221 --> 01:23:43.340
<v Speaker 3>because then she stands up and then the</v>
<v Speaker 3>bubbles kind of run down her body,</v>

1894
01:23:43.341 --> 01:23:44.060
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1895
01:23:44.060 --> 01:23:46.630
<v Speaker 3>then also might be a decision of whether</v>
<v Speaker 3>or not she could become your woman.</v>

1896
01:23:47.470 --> 01:23:49.990
<v Speaker 3>Like she could be your girlfriend or</v>
<v Speaker 3>your wife if she has bubbles.</v>

1897
01:23:49.990 --> 01:23:52.240
<v Speaker 3>Like this pitch just loved me and she</v>
<v Speaker 3>took a chance.</v>

1898
01:23:52.241 --> 01:23:55.450
<v Speaker 3>She's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We went for it and now she's so fun and</v>

1899
01:23:55.451 --> 01:23:56.740
<v Speaker 3>spontaneous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We get along great,</v>

1900
01:23:56.950 --> 01:24:00.370
<v Speaker 3>but if you show up and she's just cudi</v>
<v Speaker 3>ass naked,</v>

1901
01:24:00.371 --> 01:24:02.290
<v Speaker 3>he wouldn't be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this bitch is crazy.</v>

1902
01:24:02.470 --> 01:24:04.240
<v Speaker 3>I gotta get Outta here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't buy a house from her.</v>

1903
01:24:04.241 --> 01:24:05.770
<v Speaker 3>She's going to know my number.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1904
01:24:05.771 --> 01:24:07.810
<v Speaker 3>like you might immediately think she's</v>
<v Speaker 3>so nuts.</v>

1905
01:24:07.960 --> 01:24:11.110
<v Speaker 3>She took off her clothes and now she's</v>
<v Speaker 3>in fucking pussy soup over here.</v>

1906
01:24:12.900 --> 01:24:16.150
<v Speaker 3>Why there's got to be bubbled.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's making a big cup of asshole tea</v>

1907
01:24:16.390 --> 01:24:18.810
<v Speaker 3>and she wants me to come over and look</v>
<v Speaker 3>into it like,</v>

1908
01:24:19.060 --> 01:24:20.650
<v Speaker 3>get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get dressed.</v>

1909
01:24:20.890 --> 01:24:23.620
<v Speaker 3>I want to buy a house.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You want to go out for a drink?</v>

1910
01:24:23.621 --> 01:24:24.470
<v Speaker 3>We'll go out for a drink.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1911
01:24:24.520 --> 01:24:26.970
<v Speaker 3>some other time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but not if there's bugs.</v>

1912
01:24:27.180 --> 01:24:28.030
<v Speaker 3>Show me the fucking floor.</v>

1913
01:24:28.030 --> 01:24:29.560
<v Speaker 3>Pennants word.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ.</v>

1914
01:24:29.710 --> 01:24:32.230
<v Speaker 3>What's the inspection look like?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would think she's trying to distract</v>

1915
01:24:32.231 --> 01:24:33.610
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can try to distract me.</v>

1916
01:24:33.640 --> 01:24:34.920
<v Speaker 3>What did the inspector said?</v>
<v Speaker 3>These,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Damn.</v>

1920
01:24:41.230 --> 01:24:43.210
<v Speaker 3>It could be right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't know.</v>

1921
01:24:43.780 --> 01:24:46.150
<v Speaker 3>We don't know shit man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's distracting me.</v>

1922
01:24:46.210 --> 01:24:48.460
<v Speaker 3>It's sexual.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's sexually harassing you,</v>

1923
01:24:48.670 --> 01:24:50.220
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because you didn't request this sexually</v>

1924
01:24:50.230 --> 01:24:54.820
<v Speaker 3>distracting you and she's using her</v>
<v Speaker 3>sexuality to distract you from the world</v>

1925
01:24:54.821 --> 01:24:56.800
<v Speaker 3>around you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's keep you from making good</v>

1927
01:24:57.910 --> 01:24:59.860
<v Speaker 3>Let's flip it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What if you are a young,</v>

1928
01:24:59.861 --> 01:25:04.630
<v Speaker 3>attractive woman and you show up and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're trying to buy a house and you</v>

1929
01:25:04.631 --> 01:25:05.411
<v Speaker 3>hear,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1930
01:25:05.411 --> 01:25:06.340
<v Speaker 3>c'mon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Debbie,</v>

1931
01:25:06.341 --> 01:25:09.910
<v Speaker 3>I'm upstairs and you go up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm Mike.</v>

1932
01:25:09.911 --> 01:25:12.170
<v Speaker 3>You looking for the real estate agent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a little person,</v>

1933
01:25:12.280 --> 01:25:14.710
<v Speaker 3>you're holding onto your iphone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>checking the text message,</v>

1934
01:25:14.730 --> 01:25:18.130
<v Speaker 3>make sure you've got the right place and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you opened the door and this dude's got</v>

1935
01:25:18.131 --> 01:25:20.170
<v Speaker 3>a fucking rod and he's sitting there.</v>

1936
01:25:20.170 --> 01:25:23.020
<v Speaker 3>It's poking out like a periscope.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was thinking the same thing.</v>

1937
01:25:23.350 --> 01:25:26.590
<v Speaker 3>Call the fucking police right away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even if he had bubbles.</v>

1938
01:25:26.890 --> 01:25:28.150
<v Speaker 3>Is he naked?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1939
01:25:28.170 --> 01:25:29.470
<v Speaker 3>I'm calm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm wearing bubble bath.</v>

1940
01:25:29.560 --> 01:25:32.050
<v Speaker 3>You don't where bubbles are there?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It'd be like a court case.</v>

1941
01:25:32.051 --> 01:25:33.400
<v Speaker 3>Was he naked,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ma'am?</v>

1942
01:25:33.401 --> 01:25:35.110
<v Speaker 3>I was not naked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could not see me.</v>

1943
01:25:35.170 --> 01:25:36.610
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you naked in the water,</v>

1944
01:25:36.611 --> 01:25:37.271
<v Speaker 3>sir?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1945
01:25:37.271 --> 01:25:40.180
<v Speaker 3>I was wearing bubbles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is not clothing.</v>

1946
01:25:40.300 --> 01:25:42.070
<v Speaker 3>Who are you to decide what clothing is</v>
<v Speaker 3>made up?</v>

1947
01:25:42.190 --> 01:25:44.130
<v Speaker 3>I was making.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I was wearing something that does</v>

1948
01:25:44.230 --> 01:25:44.631
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It,</v>

1949
01:25:44.631 --> 01:25:49.631
<v Speaker 3>it hit me in a modest way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could not see my genitals and uh,</v>

1950
01:25:49.891 --> 01:25:51.280
<v Speaker 3>I feel like I was okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why would,</v>

1951
01:25:51.760 --> 01:25:54.310
<v Speaker 3>your honor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why would it be okay if he had a towel</v>

1952
01:25:54.311 --> 01:25:57.010
<v Speaker 3>on?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's not okay if it's got bubbles,</v>

1953
01:25:57.011 --> 01:25:58.960
<v Speaker 3>doesn't tell them bubbles to the same</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking thing.</v>

1954
01:25:59.650 --> 01:26:01.840
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if she would immediately</v>
<v Speaker 3>call the police.</v>

1955
01:26:02.020 --> 01:26:04.130
<v Speaker 3>I think she would probably just scream</v>
<v Speaker 3>and leave.</v>

1956
01:26:04.220 --> 01:26:05.600
<v Speaker 1>I call the police.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd say no,</v>

1957
01:26:05.610 --> 01:26:07.400
<v Speaker 1>I press nine slash 11.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While I was in the house.</v>

1958
01:26:07.640 --> 01:26:09.200
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking right at this guy's Dick.</v>

1959
01:26:09.500 --> 01:26:10.490
<v Speaker 1>This is not cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not even.</v>

1960
01:26:10.491 --> 01:26:13.690
<v Speaker 1>His house is freaky fucker wants to take</v>
<v Speaker 1>baths and some houses that.</v>

1961
01:26:13.691 --> 01:26:14.524
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is she?</v>

1962
01:26:14.780 --> 01:26:15.620
<v Speaker 1>What is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was in it,</v>

1963
01:26:15.621 --> 01:26:16.820
<v Speaker 1>but what if she just showed up and she's</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1964
01:26:16.850 --> 01:26:17.690
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dick.</v>

1965
01:26:17.710 --> 01:26:19.700
<v Speaker 1>Because when.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would you think at that point?</v>

1966
01:26:19.701 --> 01:26:21.380
<v Speaker 1>Well then you're good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1967
01:26:21.550 --> 01:26:24.270
<v Speaker 1>as long as that happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's pretty unlikely though.</v>

1968
01:26:24.340 --> 01:26:27.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's like $100 off the ball ticket</v>

1969
01:26:27.591 --> 01:26:30.410
<v Speaker 1>ever fucking made off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The chances are that crazy,</v>

1970
01:26:30.411 --> 01:26:33.830
<v Speaker 1>but they're close.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think it's one and $292 million that</v>

1971
01:26:33.831 --> 01:26:36.860
<v Speaker 1>she'll jump on the deck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you didn't know the guy and you just</v>

1972
01:26:36.861 --> 01:26:38.690
<v Speaker 1>showed up and his dick was poking out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the water,</v>

1973
01:26:38.691 --> 01:26:41.150
<v Speaker 1>you'd probably assume that was the last</v>
<v Speaker 1>few hours of your life</v>

1974
01:26:42.950 --> 01:26:46.070
<v Speaker 1>you would run and expect to immediately</v>
<v Speaker 1>run into a guy wearing a fucking hood.</v>

1975
01:26:46.340 --> 01:26:47.220
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you,</v>

1976
01:26:47.230 --> 01:26:50.270
<v Speaker 1>you standing in the next room like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to die today.</v>

1977
01:26:50.330 --> 01:26:51.860
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a young girl.</v>

1978
01:26:51.950 --> 01:26:55.760
<v Speaker 1>I can't protect myself physically from</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy with his heart on and who knows</v>

1979
01:26:55.940 --> 01:26:58.610
<v Speaker 1>how we set this up and who other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who else is in this building wants to</v>

1980
01:26:58.611 --> 01:27:01.790
<v Speaker 1>chop me up and burned me in the woods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I would assume,</v>

1981
01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:03.860
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they need to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't want to chop her up.</v>

1982
01:27:03.861 --> 01:27:05.120
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes they do though.</v>

1983
01:27:05.240 --> 01:27:09.680
<v Speaker 1>You just fucking has a big Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wants to maybe do something maybe.</v>

1984
01:27:09.770 --> 01:27:12.860
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe she walked into a fucking trap</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this guy's like,</v>

1985
01:27:13.610 --> 01:27:17.170
<v Speaker 1>Charles Manson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're always assuming the worst about</v>

1986
01:27:17.171 --> 01:27:18.260
<v Speaker 1>matt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about meme man.</v>

1987
01:27:18.261 --> 01:27:21.590
<v Speaker 1>You know he guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some guy sitting there in a truck with a</v>

1988
01:27:21.591 --> 01:27:24.320
<v Speaker 1>big erection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wants to chop her up and fuck it.</v>

1989
01:27:24.321 --> 01:27:25.070
<v Speaker 1>Barrier in the woods.</v>

1990
01:27:25.070 --> 01:27:27.800
<v Speaker 1>Some woman's in the tub,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she just wants to suck this guy's Dick</v>

1991
01:27:27.801 --> 01:27:30.080
<v Speaker 1>and show him the time of his life and</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe sell them a house.</v>

1992
01:27:30.170 --> 01:27:33.000
<v Speaker 1>Do you not watch TV?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you're saying?</v>

1993
01:27:33.001 --> 01:27:37.340
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm saying is not normal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it is pretty normal.</v>

1994
01:27:37.341 --> 01:27:39.140
<v Speaker 1>I think that's probably how most people</v>
<v Speaker 1>would think about it.</v>

1995
01:27:40.340 --> 01:27:41.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think so too,</v>

1996
01:27:41.310 --> 01:27:44.390
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why maybe the MRI's,</v>

1997
01:27:44.960 --> 01:27:46.480
<v Speaker 1>MRI's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>MRI's,</v>

1998
01:27:46.860 --> 01:27:49.820
<v Speaker 1>men's rights informant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

1999
01:27:49.821 --> 01:27:53.630
<v Speaker 1>I just want to tell you these fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>men on this side plot and some shit.</v>

2000
01:27:53.660 --> 01:27:56.840
<v Speaker 1>They're going to troll your forums.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>

2001
01:27:57.060 --> 01:28:00.110
<v Speaker 1>That would be a men's right informant or</v>
<v Speaker 1>a rat for the men's right organization</v>

2002
01:28:00.111 --> 01:28:02.750
<v Speaker 1>that tries to befriend feminists to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>close to them.</v>

2003
01:28:03.050 --> 01:28:05.060
<v Speaker 1>I try to try to be there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their lovers.</v>

2004
01:28:05.480 --> 01:28:06.960
<v Speaker 1>Would it be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2005
01:28:07.280 --> 01:28:09.340
<v Speaker 1>would it be um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a men's with the men's rights informant</v>

2006
01:28:09.350 --> 01:28:14.350
<v Speaker 1>be someone who's a coil to the men's</v>
<v Speaker 1>rights movement and trying to gather</v>

2007
01:28:14.361 --> 01:28:19.340
<v Speaker 1>intel on feminists or reporting Intel on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the men's rights movement back to</v>

2008
01:28:19.341 --> 01:28:19.800
<v Speaker 1>feminine?</v>

2009
01:28:19.800 --> 01:28:22.130
<v Speaker 1>That's a very good point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could because I could see it going</v>

2010
01:28:22.131 --> 01:28:24.680
<v Speaker 1>either way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're bright.</v>

2011
01:28:24.681 --> 01:28:27.500
<v Speaker 1>You could totally see like a guy</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretending to be a social justice</v>

2012
01:28:27.501 --> 01:28:32.360
<v Speaker 1>warrior who becomes a male feminist and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he uses hashtag feminism on his twitter</v>

2013
01:28:32.361 --> 01:28:36.800
<v Speaker 1>page and he makes videos about feminism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but really what he's doing is trying to</v>

2014
01:28:36.801 --> 01:28:37.581
<v Speaker 1>get deep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>deep,</v>

2015
01:28:37.581 --> 01:28:41.540
<v Speaker 1>deep into the roots of the organization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His ultimate goal is to get a position</v>

2016
01:28:41.750 --> 01:28:44.750
<v Speaker 1>with someone like who's that woman you</v>
<v Speaker 1>were talking about earlier before what</v>

2017
01:28:44.751 --> 01:28:48.050
<v Speaker 1>Anita Sarkeesian got one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like one of those like one of the queen</v>

2018
01:28:48.051 --> 01:28:52.730
<v Speaker 1>bees get very close to her and perhaps</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe help write some of her stuff or</v>

2019
01:28:52.731 --> 01:28:55.970
<v Speaker 1>perhaps get closer and closer to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>organization to maybe perhaps he could</v>

2020
01:28:55.971 --> 01:28:58.810
<v Speaker 1>have some influence or find out their</v>
<v Speaker 1>strategies and then what he does in the</v>

2021
01:28:58.811 --> 01:29:01.620
<v Speaker 1>clan to Stein arrangement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas the fucking black peacoat and</v>

2022
01:29:01.621 --> 01:29:02.250
<v Speaker 1>fucking</v>

2023
01:29:02.250 --> 01:29:04.750
<v Speaker 3>a wool cap and he meets on the docks</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the.</v>

2024
01:29:04.751 --> 01:29:07.410
<v Speaker 3>A real man and the real man is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are these cons planning?</v>

2025
01:29:07.620 --> 01:29:08.091
<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2026
01:29:08.091 --> 01:29:11.280
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he and he becomes a men's right in</v>

2027
01:29:11.281 --> 01:29:12.690
<v Speaker 3>form it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There you go.</v>

2028
01:29:12.750 --> 01:29:14.850
<v Speaker 3>Could be one of both things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This could be a movie.</v>

2029
01:29:15.420 --> 01:29:17.610
<v Speaker 3>I would say it would most likely go the</v>
<v Speaker 3>other way though.</v>

2030
01:29:17.790 --> 01:29:20.760
<v Speaker 3>I would doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would doubt a guy would be able to</v>

2031
01:29:20.761 --> 01:29:24.150
<v Speaker 3>even keep the job if he was a real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A real man.</v>

2032
01:29:24.210 --> 01:29:27.090
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said it a real man that goes deep into</v>

2033
01:29:27.091 --> 01:29:30.150
<v Speaker 3>the heart of the Social Justice Warrior</v>
<v Speaker 3>movement just to befriend feminists,</v>

2034
01:29:30.151 --> 01:29:33.960
<v Speaker 3>to try to be their allies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A real man would get sick to his stomach</v>

2035
01:29:33.961 --> 01:29:35.610
<v Speaker 3>and a very short amount of time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You think so?</v>

2036
01:29:35.850 --> 01:29:38.040
<v Speaker 3>Most likely,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unless they had really good points,</v>

2037
01:29:38.041 --> 01:29:40.830
<v Speaker 3>in which case they probably would just</v>
<v Speaker 3>be egalitarianism.</v>

2038
01:29:41.040 --> 01:29:42.740
<v Speaker 3>It wouldn't really be necessarily</v>
<v Speaker 3>feminine,</v>

2039
01:29:42.750 --> 01:29:46.230
<v Speaker 3>would probably be this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'd probably just be folks that</v>

2040
01:29:46.231 --> 01:29:48.570
<v Speaker 3>didn't want to get fucked with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is everybody,</v>

2041
01:29:49.800 --> 01:29:51.570
<v Speaker 3>which is all humans,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2042
01:29:51.960 --> 01:29:53.610
<v Speaker 3>but men's rights act.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I wonder though.</v>

2043
01:29:53.611 --> 01:29:54.760
<v Speaker 3>Why is it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why is it a.</v>

2044
01:29:54.810 --> 01:29:59.070
<v Speaker 3>Why isn't it okay to just be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how about everyone just treats everyone</v>

2045
01:29:59.071 --> 01:30:00.420
<v Speaker 3>okay?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Should be like,</v>

2046
01:30:00.421 --> 01:30:01.290
<v Speaker 3>why can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is it?</v>

2047
01:30:01.330 --> 01:30:05.250
<v Speaker 3>Why is that such a controversial idea?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why when you present that to a feminist,</v>

2048
01:30:05.251 --> 01:30:07.500
<v Speaker 3>like let's just be gender,</v>
<v Speaker 3>egalitarianism,</v>

2049
01:30:07.501 --> 01:30:09.930
<v Speaker 3>egalitarian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and all other ways and you know,</v>

2050
01:30:09.931 --> 01:30:12.390
<v Speaker 3>as long as someone's not hurting you or</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not hurting them,</v>

2051
01:30:12.391 --> 01:30:15.030
<v Speaker 3>you could just do whatever the fuck you</v>
<v Speaker 3>want and you know,</v>

2052
01:30:15.031 --> 01:30:18.060
<v Speaker 3>you would think that that would be a</v>
<v Speaker 3>perfectly reasonable proposition for any</v>

2053
01:30:18.061 --> 01:30:21.420
<v Speaker 3>human being of any ideology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it seems like it's rejected so</v>

2054
01:30:21.421 --> 01:30:23.610
<v Speaker 3>roundly by so many people all the</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking time,</v>

2055
01:30:23.611 --> 01:30:24.331
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2056
01:30:24.331 --> 01:30:25.164
<v Speaker 3>we don't want to do that.</v>

2057
01:30:25.350 --> 01:30:28.290
<v Speaker 3>We want to have our stupid little</v>
<v Speaker 3>ideological clique's and be like,</v>

2058
01:30:28.291 --> 01:30:30.000
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're the feminist and where are the</v>

2059
01:30:30.001 --> 01:30:32.940
<v Speaker 3>Mras?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we're gonna have some lame Internet</v>

2060
01:30:32.941 --> 01:30:35.490
<v Speaker 3>fight until the end of time and annoy</v>
<v Speaker 3>the shit out of everybody.</v>

2061
01:30:35.670 --> 01:30:36.503
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

2062
01:30:36.690 --> 01:30:39.030
<v Speaker 3>I honestly believe this all bullshit</v>
<v Speaker 3>aside.</v>

2063
01:30:39.060 --> 01:30:42.750
<v Speaker 3>I think people are way better at</v>
<v Speaker 3>communicating now than they've ever been</v>

2064
01:30:42.751 --> 01:30:46.710
<v Speaker 3>before and I think we're going through</v>
<v Speaker 3>some growing pains and I think that's</v>

2065
01:30:46.711 --> 01:30:48.340
<v Speaker 3>what a lot of this stuff is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My,</v>

2066
01:30:48.400 --> 01:30:53.400
<v Speaker 3>my honest belief is that what we're</v>
<v Speaker 3>looking at winn block watch captain Kirk</v>

2067
01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:58.620
<v Speaker 3>Duke it out with that stupid fake lizard</v>
<v Speaker 3>is very similar in a cultural context</v>

2068
01:30:58.621 --> 01:31:01.140
<v Speaker 3>like that's art.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's like a piece of art that was on</v>

2069
01:31:01.141 --> 01:31:02.730
<v Speaker 3>television.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's unacceptable today.</v>

2070
01:31:03.090 --> 01:31:05.940
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's also communication that was</v>

2071
01:31:05.941 --> 01:31:09.420
<v Speaker 3>normal back then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's unacceptable today and I think</v>

2072
01:31:09.810 --> 01:31:14.810
<v Speaker 3>along the way there's some battles and</v>
<v Speaker 3>some some lines get crossed and some</v>

2073
01:31:15.630 --> 01:31:18.390
<v Speaker 3>boundaries get established and I think</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's exactly what we're going through</v>

2074
01:31:18.391 --> 01:31:19.140
<v Speaker 3>right now.</v>

2075
01:31:19.140 --> 01:31:24.140
<v Speaker 3>When you blame men for everything and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you won't talk about the real</v>

2076
01:31:24.241 --> 01:31:26.610
<v Speaker 3>issues like your issue because you're a</v>
<v Speaker 3>male,</v>

2077
01:31:26.611 --> 01:31:30.780
<v Speaker 3>you're getting sexually harassed as</v>
<v Speaker 3>inconsequential as compared to a woman</v>

2078
01:31:30.781 --> 01:31:34.470
<v Speaker 3>who was in the same situation or whether</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's divorce laws or whether it's</v>

2079
01:31:34.471 --> 01:31:37.590
<v Speaker 3>alimony or whether it's child support or</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's custody of the children.</v>

2080
01:31:37.800 --> 01:31:42.800
<v Speaker 3>As soon as you have a male versus female</v>
<v Speaker 3>perspective and you ignore the enormous</v>

2081
01:31:44.250 --> 01:31:49.250
<v Speaker 3>gigantic range of people that exist on</v>
<v Speaker 3>the female and the male side,</v>

2082
01:31:50.160 --> 01:31:53.010
<v Speaker 3>they're so different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone's so goddamn different to to</v>

2083
01:31:53.011 --> 01:31:56.160
<v Speaker 3>have an ATM or aB team.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's becoming more and more</v>

2084
01:31:56.161 --> 01:32:00.130
<v Speaker 3>preposterous and I think that's sort of</v>
<v Speaker 3>been highlighted by why we can so freely</v>

2085
01:32:00.131 --> 01:32:03.280
<v Speaker 3>talk about this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're mining so much humor and goofing</v>

2086
01:32:03.281 --> 01:32:08.281
<v Speaker 3>on these people so easily because it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>so easy to goof on them that over time,</v>

2087
01:32:08.950 --> 01:32:12.580
<v Speaker 3>those differences,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ridiculousness of it will be</v>

2088
01:32:12.581 --> 01:32:14.380
<v Speaker 3>highlighted by our culture to the point.</v>

2089
01:32:14.380 --> 01:32:17.530
<v Speaker 3>It will be common knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody will know that it's ridiculous</v>

2090
01:32:17.531 --> 01:32:20.110
<v Speaker 3>to side with all women or decide with</v>
<v Speaker 3>all men.</v>

2091
01:32:20.320 --> 01:32:23.710
<v Speaker 3>Everyone will know that when two people</v>
<v Speaker 3>get drunk and have sex together,</v>

2092
01:32:23.980 --> 01:32:27.070
<v Speaker 3>if they're both consenting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they both fucked up and no one raped</v>

2093
01:32:27.071 --> 01:32:28.160
<v Speaker 3>anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

2094
01:32:28.390 --> 01:32:32.050
<v Speaker 3>There is a difference between rape and</v>
<v Speaker 3>two people getting drunk where the man</v>

2095
01:32:32.051 --> 01:32:35.590
<v Speaker 3>becomes a rapist and that's one of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>big problems right now that's going on</v>

2096
01:32:35.591 --> 01:32:40.591
<v Speaker 3>and this whole men's rights activist</v>
<v Speaker 3>versus feminists culture argument that</v>

2097
01:32:41.230 --> 01:32:45.460
<v Speaker 3>it's happened in at Occidental.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's happened in numerous cases where</v>

2098
01:32:45.461 --> 01:32:48.460
<v Speaker 3>people have been blamed for things where</v>
<v Speaker 3>two adults get together.</v>

2099
01:32:48.550 --> 01:32:50.800
<v Speaker 3>They have consensual sex while they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>both intoxicated,</v>

2100
01:32:50.801 --> 01:32:54.250
<v Speaker 3>but the man becomes a rapist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's fucking bullshit and it's always</v>

2101
01:32:54.251 --> 01:32:56.890
<v Speaker 3>been bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so strange because there's no,</v>

2102
01:32:56.980 --> 01:33:01.390
<v Speaker 3>there's no other area where people are</v>
<v Speaker 3>exempted from their bad decisions while</v>

2103
01:33:01.391 --> 01:33:02.224
<v Speaker 3>they're drunk.</v>

2104
01:33:02.530 --> 01:33:06.070
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I get drunk and I get in my car and I</v>

2105
01:33:06.071 --> 01:33:08.320
<v Speaker 3>crashed into a building or something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no one says,</v>

2106
01:33:08.321 --> 01:33:10.000
<v Speaker 3>well you were drunk so you were</v>
<v Speaker 3>impaired.</v>

2107
01:33:10.001 --> 01:33:12.670
<v Speaker 3>So really the building attacked you or</v>
<v Speaker 3>how about this?</v>

2108
01:33:12.671 --> 01:33:15.100
<v Speaker 3>How about you assault someone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get drunk at assault,</v>

2109
01:33:15.101 --> 01:33:16.700
<v Speaker 3>someone you're responsible for your</v>
<v Speaker 3>actions.</v>

2110
01:33:16.710 --> 01:33:17.920
<v Speaker 3>100 for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2111
01:33:18.130 --> 01:33:19.360
<v Speaker 3>It's all stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2112
01:33:19.361 --> 01:33:21.470
<v Speaker 3>It's stupid and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's based on if you hope,</v>

2113
01:33:21.500 --> 01:33:24.660
<v Speaker 3>if you're a woman and you open your legs</v>
<v Speaker 3>up while you're drunk and you,</v>

2114
01:33:24.670 --> 01:33:26.290
<v Speaker 3>they add,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bring it on,</v>

2115
01:33:26.291 --> 01:33:28.810
<v Speaker 3>you know you're not responsible for that</v>
<v Speaker 3>decision whatsoever.</v>

2116
01:33:28.860 --> 01:33:30.930
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's the one decision where</v>

2117
01:33:30.931 --> 01:33:32.470
<v Speaker 3>society societal be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>

2118
01:33:32.740 --> 01:33:35.170
<v Speaker 3>You were taken advantage of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You were raped.</v>

2119
01:33:35.530 --> 01:33:38.470
<v Speaker 3>I think that doesn't exist in most</v>
<v Speaker 3>aspects of society.</v>

2120
01:33:38.471 --> 01:33:42.250
<v Speaker 3>It only exists in universities and</v>
<v Speaker 3>amongst like super leftist,</v>

2121
01:33:42.460 --> 01:33:46.210
<v Speaker 3>progressive liberals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the only way that they're trying</v>

2122
01:33:46.211 --> 01:33:48.010
<v Speaker 3>to turn the all of society into that.</v>

2123
01:33:48.010 --> 01:33:49.960
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's being rejected is my point.</v>

2124
01:33:50.250 --> 01:33:54.000
<v Speaker 3>It's like the fact that there's so much</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's easy to criticize about it.</v>

2125
01:33:54.080 --> 01:33:57.760
<v Speaker 3>It's so easy to reject and uni just</v>
<v Speaker 3>sitting here when we just met today and</v>

2126
01:33:57.761 --> 01:34:00.250
<v Speaker 3>we both goofing on it like we like we</v>
<v Speaker 3>have a sketch,</v>

2127
01:34:00.580 --> 01:34:03.370
<v Speaker 3>like we planned out a sketch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was this the first time we've ever sat</v>

2128
01:34:03.371 --> 01:34:06.070
<v Speaker 3>down and talked together and we're like</v>
<v Speaker 3>bantering about this.</v>

2129
01:34:06.071 --> 01:34:08.980
<v Speaker 3>Like we've rehearsed it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it's because it's so easy to mine.</v>

2130
01:34:09.160 --> 01:34:11.080
<v Speaker 3>There's so much preposterous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stupid shit into it.</v>

2131
01:34:11.230 --> 01:34:12.530
<v Speaker 3>It's so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the,</v>

2132
01:34:12.600 --> 01:34:14.800
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the stereotypes are so fucking obvious.</v>

2133
01:34:14.801 --> 01:34:19.300
<v Speaker 3>He's like really feeble men who like</v>
<v Speaker 3>defend these hideous women who have</v>

2134
01:34:19.301 --> 01:34:20.620
<v Speaker 3>purple hair.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what am I,</v>

2135
01:34:21.130 --> 01:34:24.310
<v Speaker 3>is this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is this a fucking show on the WB from</v>

2136
01:34:24.311 --> 01:34:25.780
<v Speaker 3>the early nineties?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what is this?</v>

2137
01:34:26.260 --> 01:34:28.320
<v Speaker 3>Remember the web,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Wayans brothers.</v>

2138
01:34:28.330 --> 01:34:30.310
<v Speaker 3>Everyone remembers that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Come on.</v>

2139
01:34:31.330 --> 01:34:34.090
<v Speaker 3>I think as it becomes more and more</v>
<v Speaker 3>ridiculous,</v>

2140
01:34:35.530 --> 01:34:38.200
<v Speaker 3>the more people will crack on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those,</v>

2141
01:34:38.260 --> 01:34:39.660
<v Speaker 3>those ridiculous aspect,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

2142
01:34:39.890 --> 01:34:41.380
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have the same.</v>

2143
01:34:41.410 --> 01:34:44.920
<v Speaker 3>I guess I don't have the same faith in</v>
<v Speaker 3>people that you do because all what I</v>

2144
01:34:44.921 --> 01:34:49.921
<v Speaker 3>see right now is that here are some</v>
<v Speaker 3>ideas that I was subjected to these sjws</v>

2145
01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:55.090
<v Speaker 3>social justice warrior,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ultra feminist stuff.</v>

2146
01:34:55.091 --> 01:34:56.560
<v Speaker 3>I've been arguing with us on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Internet for,</v>

2147
01:34:56.561 --> 01:34:57.950
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or six years</v>

2148
01:34:57.980 --> 01:34:59.570
<v Speaker 1>who said stop arguing with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not going to change.</v>

2149
01:34:59.571 --> 01:35:00.404
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>

2150
01:35:00.860 --> 01:35:03.220
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do it because people like to watch it.</v>

2151
01:35:03.221 --> 01:35:04.490
<v Speaker 1>Like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's easy to mind,</v>

2152
01:35:04.520 --> 01:35:06.050
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

2153
01:35:06.920 --> 01:35:11.920
<v Speaker 1>I've seen them go from an obscure fringe</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Internet people who have no power</v>

2154
01:35:12.741 --> 01:35:14.800
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2155
01:35:14.810 --> 01:35:18.770
<v Speaker 1>constantly having representatives on</v>
<v Speaker 1>mainstream media.</v>

2156
01:35:19.040 --> 01:35:23.000
<v Speaker 1>They've infiltrated the journalists on</v>
<v Speaker 1>so many publications now.</v>

2157
01:35:23.001 --> 01:35:25.760
<v Speaker 1>I know that right now America is kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>going through a,</v>

2158
01:35:25.770 --> 01:35:29.300
<v Speaker 1>a disenfranchisement with the media in</v>
<v Speaker 1>general anyway.</v>

2159
01:35:29.870 --> 01:35:31.640
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2160
01:35:31.641 --> 01:35:33.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it does seem like these,</v>

2161
01:35:33.021 --> 01:35:35.870
<v Speaker 1>these people are permeating mainstream</v>
<v Speaker 1>culture more and more.</v>

2162
01:35:35.871 --> 01:35:39.270
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't seem to me like they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2163
01:35:39.290 --> 01:35:41.660
<v Speaker 1>they're on the run or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2164
01:35:41.661 --> 01:35:43.820
<v Speaker 1>you can put it this way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not sure if this is a valid</v>

2165
01:35:43.821 --> 01:35:46.640
<v Speaker 1>comparison,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you choose to engage them</v>

2166
01:35:46.641 --> 01:35:49.430
<v Speaker 1>online,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very similar to them being</v>

2167
01:35:49.460 --> 01:35:50.930
<v Speaker 1>interviewed on CNN.</v>

2168
01:35:51.110 --> 01:35:53.540
<v Speaker 1>Whereas like it's fun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fun,</v>

2169
01:35:53.541 --> 01:35:55.550
<v Speaker 1>or there's a point of view that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>controversial.</v>

2170
01:35:55.700 --> 01:35:59.930
<v Speaker 1>There's a hot a hot button that you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>hit if you have someone who does</v>

2171
01:35:59.931 --> 01:36:02.660
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some guy does something and some woman</v>

2172
01:36:03.170 --> 01:36:08.170
<v Speaker 1>goes on some television show and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>argues that that man should be tried for</v>

2173
01:36:08.571 --> 01:36:10.970
<v Speaker 1>rape because he had sex with intoxicated</v>
<v Speaker 1>woman,</v>

2174
01:36:10.971 --> 01:36:14.120
<v Speaker 1>let's say maybe a celebrity or a</v>
<v Speaker 1>rockstar or athlete or something like</v>

2175
01:36:14.121 --> 01:36:16.220
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If that became an issue,</v>

2176
01:36:16.400 --> 01:36:19.370
<v Speaker 1>like you would immediately want to have</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of those people on because one of</v>

2177
01:36:19.371 --> 01:36:22.400
<v Speaker 1>those people is going to argue the very</v>
<v Speaker 1>strong position that that guy is a</v>

2178
01:36:22.401 --> 01:36:24.560
<v Speaker 1>rapist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas then you would have some other</v>

2179
01:36:24.740 --> 01:36:28.100
<v Speaker 1>men's rights guy on the other side or</v>
<v Speaker 1>some other,</v>

2180
01:36:28.101 --> 01:36:29.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>social,</v>

2181
01:36:29.330 --> 01:36:33.520
<v Speaker 1>a libertarian type dude on the other</v>
<v Speaker 1>side and they would.</v>

2182
01:36:33.550 --> 01:36:35.660
<v Speaker 1>It would make for a great show and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what people do.</v>

2183
01:36:35.660 --> 01:36:39.350
<v Speaker 1>And so in doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those movements grow and you find out</v>

2184
01:36:39.351 --> 01:36:41.120
<v Speaker 1>who that person is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what their organization is,</v>

2185
01:36:41.121 --> 01:36:43.340
<v Speaker 1>what's the Hashtag,</v>
<v Speaker 1>find their twitter page,</v>

2186
01:36:43.341 --> 01:36:45.020
<v Speaker 1>boom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like their facebook page,</v>

2187
01:36:45.200 --> 01:36:46.340
<v Speaker 1>boom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in the circle.</v>

2188
01:36:46.460 --> 01:36:50.600
<v Speaker 1>And by doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even you arguing with them online and</v>

2189
01:36:50.660 --> 01:36:54.080
<v Speaker 1>them doing this on these one of these</v>
<v Speaker 1>CNN type shows,</v>

2190
01:36:54.500 --> 01:36:56.600
<v Speaker 1>it's the same kind of thing and a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>ways because it's just,</v>

2191
01:36:56.601 --> 01:37:01.000
<v Speaker 1>it's creating a portal where people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>agree confine those,</v>

2192
01:37:01.090 --> 01:37:03.670
<v Speaker 1>those other folks that also doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>really seem like too many people will</v>

2193
01:37:03.680 --> 01:37:05.120
<v Speaker 1>find them through me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>agree with them.</v>

2194
01:37:05.640 --> 01:37:08.210
<v Speaker 1>Some of the things I see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's comments and we've already</v>

2195
01:37:08.211 --> 01:37:11.400
<v Speaker 1>established the comments or maybe one</v>
<v Speaker 1>percent of the people watch if you</v>

2196
01:37:11.420 --> 01:37:14.620
<v Speaker 1>watch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you look at the metrics from the,</v>

2197
01:37:14.740 --> 01:37:16.670
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thumbs up and how many people</v>

2198
01:37:16.671 --> 01:37:19.070
<v Speaker 1>subscribe when they see those videos on</v>
<v Speaker 1>that stuff.</v>

2199
01:37:19.790 --> 01:37:23.210
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure there are people who find the</v>
<v Speaker 1>videos and to discover some feminists</v>

2200
01:37:23.211 --> 01:37:25.490
<v Speaker 1>through there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've never made a thumbs up in my</v>

2201
01:37:25.491 --> 01:37:27.280
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>made a comment in my life.</v>

2202
01:37:27.290 --> 01:37:30.710
<v Speaker 1>Had Milo Yiannopoulos on the show a few</v>
<v Speaker 1>weeks back.</v>

2203
01:37:31.270 --> 01:37:32.590
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you're aware,</v>

2204
01:37:32.610 --> 01:37:33.301
<v Speaker 1>but he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

2205
01:37:33.301 --> 01:37:36.860
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his twitter has been unverified.</v>

2206
01:37:36.890 --> 01:37:39.020
<v Speaker 1>We talked about it yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's insane.</v>

2207
01:37:39.021 --> 01:37:43.040
<v Speaker 1>It's very strange because I cannot</v>
<v Speaker 1>recall anyone's twitter ever becoming</v>

2208
01:37:43.041 --> 01:37:45.200
<v Speaker 1>unverified,</v>
<v Speaker 1>known plagiarists.</v>

2209
01:37:45.410 --> 01:37:47.270
<v Speaker 1>There's no plagiarists that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>verified,</v>

2210
01:37:47.300 --> 01:37:49.880
<v Speaker 1>that have been proven as plagiarists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're verified.</v>

2211
01:37:49.881 --> 01:37:53.990
<v Speaker 1>And One guy who likes to poke fun and</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck with people and does it in a really</v>

2212
01:37:53.991 --> 01:37:55.290
<v Speaker 1>humorous wally funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2213
01:37:55.291 --> 01:37:58.230
<v Speaker 1>what is his fucking twitter handle?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say the dangerous faggot.</v>

2214
01:37:58.260 --> 01:38:02.550
<v Speaker 1>I think that's what he calls himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's in a giant label across the.</v>

2215
01:38:02.551 --> 01:38:04.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the top is the dangerous faggot tour.</v>

2216
01:38:04.951 --> 01:38:06.040
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>

2217
01:38:06.360 --> 01:38:09.030
<v Speaker 1>his username is like at Nero Nero.</v>

2218
01:38:09.930 --> 01:38:11.460
<v Speaker 1>But the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing about it is,</v>

2219
01:38:11.461 --> 01:38:12.540
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2220
01:38:12.541 --> 01:38:14.040
<v Speaker 1>there you go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's hilarious.</v>

2221
01:38:14.460 --> 01:38:15.900
<v Speaker 1>He's a fun guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We had him on our show,</v>

2222
01:38:15.901 --> 01:38:18.240
<v Speaker 1>the show not too long ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

2223
01:38:18.241 --> 01:38:19.560
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing is,</v>

2224
01:38:19.580 --> 01:38:20.401
<v Speaker 1>the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2225
01:38:20.401 --> 01:38:23.090
<v Speaker 1>it Kinda just goes to the point I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about have,</v>

2226
01:38:23.170 --> 01:38:24.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's twitter,</v>

2227
01:38:24.570 --> 01:38:27.270
<v Speaker 1>obviously taking sides.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't do this to the people who</v>

2228
01:38:27.271 --> 01:38:28.460
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2229
01:38:29.400 --> 01:38:31.440
<v Speaker 1>who are feminists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do this people who are critical of,</v>

2230
01:38:31.441 --> 01:38:32.300
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the thing that's,</v>

2231
01:38:32.520 --> 01:38:35.040
<v Speaker 1>that's part of his bread and butter as</v>
<v Speaker 1>well with mining.</v>

2232
01:38:35.041 --> 01:38:36.090
<v Speaker 1>That's that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2233
01:38:36.110 --> 01:38:39.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my load doesn't have an egregious,</v>

2234
01:38:39.950 --> 01:38:42.480
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isolated incident that they could point</v>

2235
01:38:42.481 --> 01:38:44.880
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's not one thing where you violated</v>

2236
01:38:44.881 --> 01:38:46.710
<v Speaker 1>the terms of service with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've alerted him on it.</v>

2237
01:38:46.860 --> 01:38:50.160
<v Speaker 1>They just unverified them because they</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't cancel his account.</v>

2238
01:38:50.250 --> 01:38:51.780
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can't do anything.</v>

2239
01:38:51.781 --> 01:38:53.460
<v Speaker 1>It's not doing anything wrong.</v>

2240
01:38:53.730 --> 01:38:57.300
<v Speaker 1>So what they're doing by attacking him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just making them stronger.</v>

2241
01:38:57.301 --> 01:39:00.570
<v Speaker 1>It's so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got 20,000 new followers after they</v>

2242
01:39:00.571 --> 01:39:02.160
<v Speaker 1>unverified him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course he did.</v>

2243
01:39:02.161 --> 01:39:05.640
<v Speaker 1>And also there's a shit ton of people</v>
<v Speaker 1>now impersonating him on twitter.</v>

2244
01:39:05.670 --> 01:39:10.050
<v Speaker 1>Of course he's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not verified so I can be Milo</v>

2245
01:39:10.050 --> 01:39:11.610
<v Speaker 1>Yiannopoulos and so can I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so can I,</v>

2246
01:39:12.190 --> 01:39:15.840
<v Speaker 1>it's been like hit the reaction from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>community,</v>

2247
01:39:16.330 --> 01:39:19.140
<v Speaker 1>but it's been a disastrous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible decision for twitter.</v>

2248
01:39:19.141 --> 01:39:22.560
<v Speaker 1>But it Kinda shows where twitter's head</v>
<v Speaker 1>is at in this whole thing.</v>

2249
01:39:22.561 --> 01:39:24.660
<v Speaker 1>And there's so many sites that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>taking on these,</v>

2250
01:39:25.250 --> 01:39:27.540
<v Speaker 1>these guidelines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you actually read youtubes</v>

2251
01:39:27.541 --> 01:39:31.080
<v Speaker 1>guidelines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like so many videos that I've made and</v>

2252
01:39:31.081 --> 01:39:35.160
<v Speaker 1>that other youtubers like me have made</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Sargon of cod.</v>

2253
01:39:35.220 --> 01:39:36.270
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you're familiar with</v>
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

2254
01:39:36.440 --> 01:39:38.830
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A tenderfoot underfoot.</v>

2255
01:39:38.880 --> 01:39:41.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like so many of our videos really,</v>

2256
01:39:41.880 --> 01:39:46.880
<v Speaker 1>if if youtube just changed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not even the verbiage of the guidelines,</v>

2257
01:39:47.221 --> 01:39:49.200
<v Speaker 1>but just their interpretation like</v>
<v Speaker 1>those.</v>

2258
01:39:49.290 --> 01:39:51.330
<v Speaker 1>All of our channels could be gone</v>
<v Speaker 1>easily.</v>

2259
01:39:51.910 --> 01:39:56.340
<v Speaker 1>They can say all of this is wrong and</v>
<v Speaker 1>sexist and vulgar and whatever guy in</v>

2260
01:39:56.341 --> 01:40:01.341
<v Speaker 1>Canada going to jail for doing nothing</v>
<v Speaker 1>more than a criticizing feminist online.</v>

2261
01:40:01.531 --> 01:40:03.870
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that's played out yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A gag order.</v>

2262
01:40:03.990 --> 01:40:05.460
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Canada has different laws.</v>

2263
01:40:05.560 --> 01:40:09.660
<v Speaker 1>Surely this is how it's been explained</v>
<v Speaker 1>to me and that this guy had already had</v>

2264
01:40:09.661 --> 01:40:11.970
<v Speaker 1>an issue with these women and had a gag</v>
<v Speaker 1>order to put on him.</v>

2265
01:40:12.150 --> 01:40:16.080
<v Speaker 1>Then he violated the gag order by</v>
<v Speaker 1>responding to their criticisms of him</v>

2266
01:40:16.081 --> 01:40:17.880
<v Speaker 1>online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His point was like,</v>

2267
01:40:17.881 --> 01:40:21.090
<v Speaker 1>you can't just talk about me on twitter</v>
<v Speaker 1>and not have me respond.</v>

2268
01:40:21.091 --> 01:40:23.130
<v Speaker 1>That's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're bullying me now,</v>

2269
01:40:23.250 --> 01:40:27.930
<v Speaker 1>and so he went after them after they did</v>
<v Speaker 1>that and then he gets arrested.</v>

2270
01:40:28.050 --> 01:40:32.220
<v Speaker 1>Then he gets like legit legal trouble,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the question is should someone be</v>

2271
01:40:32.221 --> 01:40:35.820
<v Speaker 1>able to have a gag order?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he apparently was working with them</v>

2272
01:40:35.821 --> 01:40:37.710
<v Speaker 1>at one point in time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knew them first,</v>

2273
01:40:38.070 --> 01:40:42.900
<v Speaker 1>then became a look.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have a gag order,</v>

2274
01:40:43.390 --> 01:40:45.260
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that,</v>

2275
01:40:45.300 --> 01:40:48.810
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't give the people who put it</v>
<v Speaker 1>against you the right to endlessly</v>

2276
01:40:48.811 --> 01:40:52.290
<v Speaker 1>publicly humiliate you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you have the right to recourse.</v>

2277
01:40:52.291 --> 01:40:54.010
<v Speaker 1>That was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she felt she had free shots at</v>

2278
01:40:54.010 --> 01:40:55.690
<v Speaker 2>him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so she started taking them and then he</v>

2279
01:40:55.691 --> 01:40:56.770
<v Speaker 2>was responding to those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

2280
01:40:56.771 --> 01:41:01.000
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't defend myself and somehow or</v>
<v Speaker 2>another in Canada that was worthy of an</v>

2281
01:41:01.001 --> 01:41:02.710
<v Speaker 2>arrest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2282
01:41:02.711 --> 01:41:05.350
<v Speaker 2>I get messages all the time about Sweden</v>
<v Speaker 2>too,</v>

2283
01:41:05.351 --> 01:41:10.090
<v Speaker 2>about how things are going crazy in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sweden as a question though,</v>

2284
01:41:10.120 --> 01:41:12.970
<v Speaker 2>in terms of like I've been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've written several messages have been</v>

2285
01:41:12.971 --> 01:41:15.730
<v Speaker 2>written to me about how it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it's,</v>

2286
01:41:15.731 --> 01:41:17.200
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not against the law or anything,</v>

2287
01:41:17.201 --> 01:41:21.400
<v Speaker 2>but it's very frowned upon for men to</v>
<v Speaker 2>pee standing up anymore.</v>

2288
01:41:21.440 --> 01:41:22.810
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The should sit down like a bitch.</v>

2289
01:41:23.110 --> 01:41:24.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to sit down now.</v>

2290
01:41:27.130 --> 01:41:31.420
<v Speaker 2>Why is it so bad to sit down and pick?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if I ever showed it at the same</v>

2291
01:41:31.421 --> 01:41:33.100
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a fucking problem with it,</v>

2292
01:41:33.101 --> 01:41:37.150
<v Speaker 2>but I like having the option of standing</v>
<v Speaker 2>up if I fucking want to.</v>

2293
01:41:37.210 --> 01:41:38.370
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2294
01:41:38.380 --> 01:41:43.330
<v Speaker 2>I mean if it was like we suggest you sit</v>
<v Speaker 2>down and here's some reasons why I'd be</v>

2295
01:41:43.331 --> 01:41:43.841
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2296
01:41:43.841 --> 01:41:45.550
<v Speaker 2>these are worth considering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

2297
01:41:45.940 --> 01:41:49.210
<v Speaker 2>But if it's like you should sit down</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's unfair to women who don't</v>

2298
01:41:49.211 --> 01:41:50.170
<v Speaker 2>have a penis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

2299
01:41:50.171 --> 01:41:51.520
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that what they're signing?</v>

2300
01:41:51.630 --> 01:41:52.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>

2301
01:41:52.150 --> 01:41:53.680
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't write the biology.</v>

2302
01:41:53.681 --> 01:41:54.630
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wait a minute.</v>

2303
01:41:54.631 --> 01:41:56.260
<v Speaker 2>Someone's actually said that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2304
01:41:56.410 --> 01:41:58.450
<v Speaker 2>That may be unfair to women who don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a penis.</v>

2305
01:41:58.451 --> 01:41:59.860
<v Speaker 2>That you can stand and pee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2306
01:41:59.861 --> 01:42:00.371
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2307
01:42:00.371 --> 01:42:04.120
<v Speaker 2>it's looked at as a male privilege.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What about birth till we get pregnant as</v>

2308
01:42:04.121 --> 01:42:04.570
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

2309
01:42:04.570 --> 01:42:07.690
<v Speaker 2>Maybe we should put like Arnold 15 pound</v>
<v Speaker 2>rock in our stomach.</v>

2310
01:42:08.210 --> 01:42:09.490
<v Speaker 2>Junior.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know if you remember that.</v>

2311
01:42:09.491 --> 01:42:10.720
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he got pregnant.</v>

2312
01:42:10.721 --> 01:42:12.960
<v Speaker 2>He actually got pregnant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But.</v>

2313
01:42:13.280 --> 01:42:15.310
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2314
01:42:15.311 --> 01:42:18.180
<v Speaker 2>I would have liked that movie better if</v>
<v Speaker 2>they showed the scene of the baby</v>

2315
01:42:18.181 --> 01:42:20.020
<v Speaker 2>fucking coming out of his cock.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2316
01:42:20.021 --> 01:42:23.230
<v Speaker 2>just like ripping it apart like a</v>
<v Speaker 2>bloomin' onion.</v>

2317
01:42:23.231 --> 01:42:24.970
<v Speaker 2>I think you got a c section.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2318
01:42:24.971 --> 01:42:25.900
<v Speaker 2>probably.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2319
01:42:25.901 --> 01:42:28.810
<v Speaker 2>I would assume.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they should have had that scene</v>

2320
01:42:28.811 --> 01:42:30.430
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Schwarzenegger's sneakers,</v>

2321
01:42:30.431 --> 01:42:34.900
<v Speaker 2>cock being destroyed by a fucking baby</v>
<v Speaker 2>swing out of it.</v>

2322
01:42:34.960 --> 01:42:37.480
<v Speaker 2>You don't have any faith that we're</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to work through this really</v>

2323
01:42:37.481 --> 01:42:40.180
<v Speaker 2>unfortunate moment in our culture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh No,</v>

2324
01:42:40.181 --> 01:42:41.380
<v Speaker 2>I'm anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's possibility.</v>

2325
01:42:41.410 --> 01:42:43.900
<v Speaker 2>Do you think if president trump gets an</v>
<v Speaker 2>office,</v>

2326
01:42:43.901 --> 01:42:46.090
<v Speaker 2>everything will be solved?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2327
01:42:46.150 --> 01:42:46.760
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

2328
01:42:46.760 --> 01:42:49.030
<v Speaker 2>I think he could solve some problems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

2329
01:42:49.060 --> 01:42:49.920
<v Speaker 2>What do he get solved?</v>

2330
01:42:50.110 --> 01:42:52.960
<v Speaker 2>I think he could do good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some good things on infrastructure.</v>

2331
01:42:52.961 --> 01:42:57.190
<v Speaker 2>I like his tufts stance on China.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wish that he would be.</v>

2332
01:42:57.500 --> 01:43:01.630
<v Speaker 2>I wish instead of talking about a trade</v>
<v Speaker 2>tariffs against China,</v>

2333
01:43:01.631 --> 01:43:05.470
<v Speaker 2>he would actually talk about maybe</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting China to cut off supply lines</v>

2334
01:43:05.510 --> 01:43:07.160
<v Speaker 2>North Korea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Since you know,</v>

2335
01:43:07.760 --> 01:43:09.970
<v Speaker 2>there's a country that actually poses a</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking grave,</v>

2336
01:43:09.971 --> 01:43:11.710
<v Speaker 2>imminent threat that no one wants to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything about.</v>

2337
01:43:11.800 --> 01:43:13.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no resources over there to jack</v>

2338
01:43:14.940 --> 01:43:16.990
<v Speaker 2>because we can't poor people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

2339
01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:18.940
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's a guy that's,</v>

2340
01:43:18.970 --> 01:43:20.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>putting his own citizens in</v>

2341
01:43:20.231 --> 01:43:23.500
<v Speaker 2>concentration camps whenever they</v>
<v Speaker 2>questioned is already killing people.</v>

2342
01:43:23.530 --> 01:43:28.510
<v Speaker 2>Here's a guy who was definitely working</v>
<v Speaker 2>on various weapons programs,</v>

2343
01:43:28.850 --> 01:43:30.430
<v Speaker 2>a hydrogen bomb.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2344
01:43:30.431 --> 01:43:32.260
<v Speaker 2>I've heard some people be skeptical of</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2345
01:43:32.261 --> 01:43:32.981
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2346
01:43:32.981 --> 01:43:34.090
<v Speaker 2>you're online.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2347
01:43:35.440 --> 01:43:37.300
<v Speaker 2>So there's always skeptics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

2348
01:43:38.740 --> 01:43:39.511
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean like what,</v>

2349
01:43:39.511 --> 01:43:40.900
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever the case may be.</v>

2350
01:43:40.900 --> 01:43:43.990
<v Speaker 2>It's a dangerous fucking place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>China is the only thing keeping them</v>

2351
01:43:43.991 --> 01:43:47.060
<v Speaker 2>solvent because they're the ones that</v>
<v Speaker 2>have the supply line.</v>

2352
01:43:47.061 --> 01:43:49.540
<v Speaker 2>So if trump wants to have this big,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tough stance on China,</v>

2353
01:43:49.541 --> 01:43:51.890
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand why he doesn't come</v>
<v Speaker 2>out and say we're going to fucking get</v>

2354
01:43:51.891 --> 01:43:55.550
<v Speaker 2>China to stop feeding this fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>monster of North Korea.</v>

2355
01:43:56.150 --> 01:43:57.140
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do like that.</v>

2356
01:43:57.141 --> 01:43:59.840
<v Speaker 2>He's tough on China in terms of like</v>
<v Speaker 2>trade tariffs and shit.</v>

2357
01:43:59.841 --> 01:44:01.810
<v Speaker 2>And I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2358
01:44:02.180 --> 01:44:04.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a lot of is a lot of his trade policy</v>

2359
01:44:04.101 --> 01:44:07.340
<v Speaker 2>and like a lot of his aggressive stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember I was watching an interview</v>

2360
01:44:07.341 --> 01:44:08.540
<v Speaker 2>with trump where he was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2361
01:44:09.080 --> 01:44:11.420
<v Speaker 2>Vladimir Putin will respect me and all</v>
<v Speaker 2>this shit,</v>

2362
01:44:11.421 --> 01:44:12.171
<v Speaker 2>and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2363
01:44:12.171 --> 01:44:13.070
<v Speaker 2>shut up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

2364
01:44:13.071 --> 01:44:15.050
<v Speaker 2>I will cut you open,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

2365
01:44:15.150 --> 01:44:19.040
<v Speaker 2>Then I was watching a Vladimir Putin</v>
<v Speaker 2>talk and they asked him who he thought</v>

2366
01:44:19.041 --> 01:44:20.000
<v Speaker 2>the strongest candidate was.</v>

2367
01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:21.260
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like trump,</v>

2368
01:44:21.650 --> 01:44:22.970
<v Speaker 2>you're strong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2369
01:44:22.971 --> 01:44:26.680
<v Speaker 2>so maybe Donald Trump was right when he</v>
<v Speaker 2>was reading Vladimir Putin.</v>

2370
01:44:26.720 --> 01:44:28.970
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that is the guy that Putin will</v>
<v Speaker 2>respect.</v>

2371
01:44:29.420 --> 01:44:31.190
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're not sure that we should be looking</v>

2372
01:44:31.191 --> 01:44:34.820
<v Speaker 2>for Putin's respect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's interesting when you go online</v>

2373
01:44:34.821 --> 01:44:37.100
<v Speaker 2>and see the trump supporters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2374
01:44:37.101 --> 01:44:38.870
<v Speaker 2>boy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's more interesting to meet them in</v>

2375
01:44:38.871 --> 01:44:41.360
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of strange humans in that</v>

2376
01:44:41.361 --> 01:44:42.500
<v Speaker 2>group.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2377
01:44:42.670 --> 01:44:46.310
<v Speaker 2>Like finally a candidate who sees things</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way I do.</v>

2378
01:44:46.780 --> 01:44:49.580
<v Speaker 2>Personally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was telling your they over there that,</v>

2379
01:44:49.581 --> 01:44:52.850
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I was at Disney world a few months</v>

2380
01:44:52.850 --> 01:44:54.500
<v Speaker 2>ago because my mom is obsessed with</v>
<v Speaker 2>Disney world.</v>

2381
01:44:54.501 --> 01:44:57.530
<v Speaker 2>She always wants to go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She'd been 23 fucking times and I've</v>

2382
01:44:57.531 --> 01:44:58.910
<v Speaker 2>been dragged a few times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

2383
01:44:59.300 --> 01:45:00.590
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I met a trump supporter.</v>

2384
01:45:00.591 --> 01:45:02.300
<v Speaker 2>They're your mom 10.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2385
01:45:02.960 --> 01:45:05.720
<v Speaker 2>she's a 50.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

2386
01:45:07.160 --> 01:45:11.950
<v Speaker 2>I met this trumps for their big fat</v>
<v Speaker 2>woman stuck in a scooter cart.</v>

2387
01:45:12.140 --> 01:45:13.160
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2388
01:45:13.161 --> 01:45:13.821
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2389
01:45:13.821 --> 01:45:14.870
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's like,</v>

2390
01:45:14.871 --> 01:45:15.680
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2391
01:45:15.680 --> 01:45:17.000
<v Speaker 2>she's talking about trump and she's</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2392
01:45:17.690 --> 01:45:20.240
<v Speaker 2>I hate Mexicans across the street from</v>
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

2393
01:45:20.241 --> 01:45:25.241
<v Speaker 2>They are all illegal and loud now on day</v>
<v Speaker 2>nathen while now one do nothing about</v>

2394
01:45:26.001 --> 01:45:27.830
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why we got to get trump in there.</v>

2395
01:45:27.831 --> 01:45:30.520
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what we going to do if we</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't get trumped.</v>

2396
01:45:30.590 --> 01:45:31.940
<v Speaker 2>Almost crying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

2397
01:45:32.200 --> 01:45:36.470
<v Speaker 2>Like emotional impassioned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like she wants fucking trump and she</v>

2398
01:45:36.471 --> 01:45:37.610
<v Speaker 2>wants him now.</v>

2399
01:45:37.990 --> 01:45:40.290
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he's going to fix everything.</v>

2400
01:45:40.440 --> 01:45:41.640
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's gonna fix everything.</v>

2401
01:45:41.641 --> 01:45:44.250
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one's ever fixed everything.</v>

2402
01:45:44.400 --> 01:45:47.040
<v Speaker 3>No one has ever gotten office and</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking shit got way better.</v>

2403
01:45:47.041 --> 01:45:52.041
<v Speaker 3>But the reality of the presidency,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you look at Obama's presidency,</v>

2404
01:45:53.240 --> 01:45:55.140
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as far as accomplishments,</v>

2405
01:45:56.130 --> 01:45:59.100
<v Speaker 3>it's very confusing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very confusing when you look at</v>

2406
01:45:59.101 --> 01:45:59.521
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2407
01:45:59.521 --> 01:46:01.200
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the data as far as,</v>

2408
01:46:01.270 --> 01:46:04.020
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the economy because many people think</v>

2409
01:46:04.021 --> 01:46:07.380
<v Speaker 3>that he's done an incredible job of</v>
<v Speaker 3>building up the economy and,</v>

2410
01:46:07.381 --> 01:46:09.510
<v Speaker 3>and making the economy come back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And like,</v>

2411
01:46:09.511 --> 01:46:14.511
<v Speaker 3>so I don't know because other people say</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the economy came back on a cycle</v>

2412
01:46:14.910 --> 01:46:18.630
<v Speaker 3>and that it was on a downward trend and</v>
<v Speaker 3>when the crash of 2008 happened,</v>

2413
01:46:19.320 --> 01:46:22.380
<v Speaker 3>there's automatically like a rebounding</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's what happens.</v>

2414
01:46:22.410 --> 01:46:26.670
<v Speaker 3>Things go bad and then they get better</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's been shifts.</v>

2415
01:46:26.920 --> 01:46:30.820
<v Speaker 2>The economy got a lot better for a Wall</v>
<v Speaker 2>Street.</v>

2416
01:46:30.880 --> 01:46:32.890
<v Speaker 2>It didn't really get too much better for</v>
<v Speaker 2>normal people.</v>

2417
01:46:34.270 --> 01:46:36.970
<v Speaker 3>But when you limit the statistics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went up a little bit.</v>

2418
01:46:37.420 --> 01:46:39.310
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what I'm saying though is a tick.</v>

2419
01:46:39.311 --> 01:46:40.750
<v Speaker 3>But there's still huge unemployment</v>
<v Speaker 3>problem.</v>

2420
01:46:40.790 --> 01:46:43.000
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well isn't it also the see the</v>

2421
01:46:43.001 --> 01:46:46.360
<v Speaker 3>unemployment things confusing to me too</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I think what also happens with</v>

2422
01:46:46.361 --> 01:46:48.940
<v Speaker 3>unemployment is if you're not looking</v>
<v Speaker 3>for a job anymore,</v>

2423
01:46:48.960 --> 01:46:50.310
<v Speaker 3>it's not counted as unemployed.</v>

2424
01:46:50.370 --> 01:46:51.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the people who gave up,</v>

2425
01:46:52.170 --> 01:46:53.820
<v Speaker 1>they don't count them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a lot of them.</v>

2426
01:46:53.880 --> 01:46:57.330
<v Speaker 1>They said there's a lot of people now</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are quote unquote retiring in their</v>

2427
01:46:57.570 --> 01:47:00.090
<v Speaker 1>twenties and stuff like they just given</v>
<v Speaker 1>up on work.</v>

2428
01:47:00.091 --> 01:47:00.940
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eh,</v>

2429
01:47:02.300 --> 01:47:03.780
<v Speaker 1>fuck the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you eat?</v>

2430
01:47:03.930 --> 01:47:06.570
<v Speaker 1>You just leach,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just Leech off other people.</v>

2431
01:47:06.930 --> 01:47:08.130
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's gotta be a lot of that.</v>

2432
01:47:08.131 --> 01:47:10.950
<v Speaker 1>That's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a constant in society.</v>

2433
01:47:10.951 --> 01:47:13.920
<v Speaker 1>You're always gonna have people that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>lazy and unmotivated.</v>

2434
01:47:13.950 --> 01:47:17.790
<v Speaker 1>That's just always going to exist and</v>
<v Speaker 1>people will demonize those people and</v>

2435
01:47:17.820 --> 01:47:21.000
<v Speaker 1>try to say that all poor people or that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's not necessarily true.</v>

2436
01:47:21.310 --> 01:47:23.760
<v Speaker 1>That's not true at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know some really hard working people</v>

2437
01:47:23.761 --> 01:47:24.910
<v Speaker 1>who were very poor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2438
01:47:24.990 --> 01:47:27.000
<v Speaker 1>and it's also like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>excuse me,</v>

2439
01:47:27.660 --> 01:47:30.480
<v Speaker 1>circumstances which you were born where</v>
<v Speaker 1>you live,</v>

2440
01:47:30.481 --> 01:47:34.170
<v Speaker 1>the environment and where you find</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself stuck as a small person with</v>

2441
01:47:34.171 --> 01:47:38.130
<v Speaker 1>parents that you didn't ask for in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>city that you didn't pick and you're</v>

2442
01:47:38.131 --> 01:47:38.970
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well fuck,</v>

2443
01:47:39.270 --> 01:47:41.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the idea that that person's the same</v>

2444
01:47:41.311 --> 01:47:44.490
<v Speaker 1>person as someone who's born in Beverly</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hills to fucking really wonderful</v>

2445
01:47:44.491 --> 01:47:46.770
<v Speaker 1>parents who bring them to a nice private</v>
<v Speaker 1>school.</v>

2446
01:47:46.770 --> 01:47:47.730
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's crazy.</v>

2447
01:47:47.970 --> 01:47:49.470
<v Speaker 1>But this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what you're saying right now.</v>

2448
01:47:49.471 --> 01:47:51.630
<v Speaker 1>That's another one of these things</v>
<v Speaker 1>people like to rebel against.</v>

2449
01:47:51.660 --> 01:47:53.790
<v Speaker 1>They don't like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't like the reality of like</v>

2450
01:47:53.791 --> 01:47:56.730
<v Speaker 1>maybe we all have different</v>
<v Speaker 1>circumstances and different hurdles to</v>

2451
01:47:56.731 --> 01:47:58.230
<v Speaker 1>overcome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't want to hear anything like</v>

2452
01:47:58.231 --> 01:47:58.980
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2453
01:47:58.980 --> 01:48:02.520
<v Speaker 1>they just want to hear that America is</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fucking dream that,</v>

2454
01:48:02.730 --> 01:48:04.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody can be a success here.</v>

2455
01:48:04.661 --> 01:48:07.410
<v Speaker 1>Any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any child born can be president one day</v>

2456
01:48:07.411 --> 01:48:08.400
<v Speaker 1>or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>

2457
01:48:08.401 --> 01:48:10.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just not realistic.</v>

2458
01:48:10.440 --> 01:48:12.780
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the child wants to suck Satan's Dick</v>

2459
01:48:12.781 --> 01:48:16.350
<v Speaker 1>and make its way through the labyrinth</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the center of the heart of darkness,</v>

2460
01:48:16.351 --> 01:48:18.540
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every child can be president,</v>

2461
01:48:18.541 --> 01:48:19.920
<v Speaker 1>but I don't have to go through the whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>song,</v>

2462
01:48:19.990 --> 01:48:22.800
<v Speaker 1>believe in Satan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas Satan's Dick is real.</v>

2463
01:48:22.801 --> 01:48:23.880
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You seen it.</v>

2464
01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:25.140
<v Speaker 1>Bill Hicks had a joke about it.</v>

2465
01:48:25.170 --> 01:48:29.950
<v Speaker 1>I know it's real</v>
<v Speaker 1>effects.</v>

2466
01:48:29.951 --> 01:48:31.590
<v Speaker 1>He would do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2467
01:48:32.340 --> 01:48:34.590
<v Speaker 1>Satan's cock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw him do that live couple times.</v>

2468
01:48:34.660 --> 01:48:35.550
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Awesome.</v>

2469
01:48:35.960 --> 01:48:39.660
<v Speaker 1>He had a really long Harlan once live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never saw a bill Hicks live.</v>

2470
01:48:40.050 --> 01:48:43.590
<v Speaker 1>I saw Hicks alive a few times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe three or four,</v>

2471
01:48:43.620 --> 01:48:45.720
<v Speaker 1>I think four times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's awesome.</v>

2472
01:48:45.750 --> 01:48:47.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a lot of fun.</v>

2473
01:48:47.430 --> 01:48:49.710
<v Speaker 1>I saw him before anyone knew who he was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>

2474
01:48:50.510 --> 01:48:55.510
<v Speaker 1>I saw him when he had just done one of</v>
<v Speaker 1>those Hbo Young Comedian Specials and a</v>

2475
01:48:58.130 --> 01:49:00.030
<v Speaker 1>note like very few people knew who he</v>
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>

2476
01:49:00.031 --> 01:49:02.700
<v Speaker 1>like maybe a few people that knew that</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had been on hbo,</v>

2477
01:49:02.701 --> 01:49:04.590
<v Speaker 1>like if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you were on the marquee.</v>

2478
01:49:04.650 --> 01:49:05.640
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>been on HBO.</v>

2479
01:49:05.700 --> 01:49:06.533

<v Speaker 1>all right.</v>

2480
01:49:06.540 --> 01:49:10.500
<v Speaker 1>But it's seven minutes on HBO.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a bunch of funny gags and</v>

2481
01:49:10.501 --> 01:49:12.240
<v Speaker 1>bits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then when you see them live,</v>

2482
01:49:12.241 --> 01:49:17.241
<v Speaker 1>you got to see this full attack on</v>
<v Speaker 1>culture or life in general and the mall</v>

2483
01:49:17.731 --> 01:49:21.330

<v Speaker 1>it was awesome.</v>

2486
01:49:28.590 --> 01:49:30.240
<v Speaker 1>It was awesome because I didn't expect</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2487
01:49:30.810 --> 01:49:32.550
<v Speaker 1>The first time I saw him I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Like this is,</v>

2489
01:49:34.051 --> 01:49:35.970

<v Speaker 1>comedy.</v>

2492
01:49:38.641 --> 01:49:41.100
<v Speaker 1>a fan of unfortunate man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

<v Speaker 3>by it.</v>

2507
01:50:13.300 --> 01:50:16.060
<v Speaker 3>So it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was also weird too that he was so</v>

2508
01:50:16.061 --> 01:50:18.130
<v Speaker 3>young,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like he died of cancer.</v>

2509
01:50:18.131 --> 01:50:20.800
<v Speaker 3>I think he was 33 or 34 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2510
01:50:20.801 --> 01:50:25.360
<v Speaker 3>It was really young and so much work</v>
<v Speaker 3>done by that time and so much of an</v>

2511
01:50:25.361 --> 01:50:27.830
<v Speaker 3>impact on the people that saw it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like he,</v>

2512
01:50:27.940 --> 01:50:30.430
<v Speaker 3>there was a possibility that he could've</v>
<v Speaker 3>gone to shit if he'd still been around</v>

2513
01:50:30.431 --> 01:50:31.840
<v Speaker 3>because like what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is it,</v>

2514
01:50:32.080 --> 01:50:32.913
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

2515
01:50:32.940 --> 01:50:35.830
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a thing with like it happens with</v>

2516
01:50:35.831 --> 01:50:37.710
<v Speaker 3>comedians that happens with musicians.</v>

2517
01:50:37.710 --> 01:50:42.070
<v Speaker 3>It happens with movie directors happens</v>
<v Speaker 3>with just artists in general of like all</v>

2518
01:50:42.071 --> 01:50:45.820
<v Speaker 3>their good shit is really early on and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then it just seems like it goes</v>

2519
01:50:45.821 --> 01:50:47.560
<v Speaker 3>downhill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that just like a matter of public</v>

2520
01:50:47.561 --> 01:50:49.660
<v Speaker 3>perception or do you think there's</v>
<v Speaker 3>something that like changes in the</v>

2521
01:50:49.661 --> 01:50:54.460
<v Speaker 3>mentality or it's depends on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>individual and what they work at.</v>

2522
01:50:54.461 --> 01:50:58.150
<v Speaker 3>But a good example is David Bowie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>David Bowie kept producing to the very</v>

2523
01:50:58.151 --> 01:50:59.490
<v Speaker 3>end.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean he just really wants to grab</v>

2524
01:50:59.520 --> 01:51:00.131
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was great.</v>

2525
01:51:00.131 --> 01:51:01.900
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think it's,</v>

2526
01:51:01.901 --> 01:51:06.160
<v Speaker 3>what are your motivations like what's</v>
<v Speaker 3>motivating you to produce things so you,</v>

2527
01:51:06.230 --> 01:51:10.780
<v Speaker 3>you just trying to fill up a hole that</v>
<v Speaker 3>was left by having an asshole stepmother</v>

2528
01:51:10.781 --> 01:51:13.180
<v Speaker 3>who you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking screamed at you and kicked you</v>

2529
01:51:13.181 --> 01:51:15.220
<v Speaker 3>out of the house when you're 17.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that what it is?</v>

2530
01:51:15.370 --> 01:51:18.580
<v Speaker 3>Or a zero,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a legit desire to create and have</v>

2531
01:51:18.581 --> 01:51:21.190
<v Speaker 3>you cultivated that legit desire to</v>
<v Speaker 3>create?</v>

2532
01:51:21.430 --> 01:51:25.690
<v Speaker 3>I think some artists continued to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>really good throughout their lives and</v>

2533
01:51:25.691 --> 01:51:28.650
<v Speaker 3>then some artists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they hit this wall somewhere and that</v>

2534
01:51:28.670 --> 01:51:32.820
<v Speaker 3>it's a wall sort of seems to coincide.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Superstardom like I think there's</v>

2535
01:51:32.860 --> 01:51:36.880
<v Speaker 3>stardom and then their superstardom and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think superstardom is almost</v>

2536
01:51:36.881 --> 01:51:40.960
<v Speaker 3>impossible to ask someone to navigate</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's Michael Jackson level of</v>

2537
01:51:40.961 --> 01:51:44.710
<v Speaker 3>fame or fucking axl rose or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's a level where</v>

2538
01:51:44.711 --> 01:51:48.760
<v Speaker 3>everybody's just like your brain just</v>
<v Speaker 3>get fucking scrabbled.</v>

2539
01:51:48.761 --> 01:51:49.091
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

2540
01:51:49.091 --> 01:51:50.170
<v Speaker 3>I could take it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if you ever,</v>

2541
01:51:50.171 --> 01:51:53.470
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have you ever been in a fighter jet blue</v>

2542
01:51:53.471 --> 01:51:55.570
<v Speaker 3>angels type situation now they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2543
01:51:55.700 --> 01:51:57.430
<v Speaker 3>they roller coasters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

2544
01:51:57.460 --> 01:52:00.380
<v Speaker 3>I don't fuck around with like g forces</v>
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>

2545
01:52:00.440 --> 01:52:02.170
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and a lot of ways it's kind of similar</v>

2546
01:52:02.171 --> 01:52:04.690
<v Speaker 3>in some ways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but way more extreme obviously in</v>

2547
01:52:04.700 --> 01:52:07.000
<v Speaker 3>someone else's piloting it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I'm just saying like,</v>

2548
01:52:07.001 --> 01:52:10.120
<v Speaker 3>I can't even handle the little kitty</v>
<v Speaker 3>pussy version of that.</v>

2549
01:52:10.120 --> 01:52:14.140
<v Speaker 3>So there's no way there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's amount of g force that you can</v>

2550
01:52:14.141 --> 01:52:17.890
<v Speaker 3>take and it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody has a number and it gets to</v>

2551
01:52:17.891 --> 01:52:19.000
<v Speaker 3>like six,</v>
<v Speaker 3>seven,</v>

2552
01:52:19.210 --> 01:52:20.080
<v Speaker 3>eight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nine,</v>

2553
01:52:20.090 --> 01:52:22.960
<v Speaker 3>10.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the guys who are like the heavy duty</v>

2554
01:52:22.961 --> 01:52:27.961
<v Speaker 3>hardcore blue angel dudes can get into</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the 11th and twelfth and they just</v>

2555
01:52:27.971 --> 01:52:30.160
<v Speaker 3>stay conscious through this insane</v>
<v Speaker 3>pressure.</v>

2556
01:52:30.280 --> 01:52:32.500
<v Speaker 3>So they're banking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He take these hard turns.</v>

2557
01:52:32.501 --> 01:52:37.450
<v Speaker 3>The g forces is overwhelming because you</v>
<v Speaker 3>have a jet engine and a plane that</v>

2558
01:52:37.451 --> 01:52:42.451
<v Speaker 3>weighs nothing and it's just flying</v>
<v Speaker 3>through the canyons and you're black out</v>

2559
01:52:42.571 --> 01:52:46.820
<v Speaker 3>like you feel your consciousness closing</v>
<v Speaker 3>like an elevator door and some people</v>

2560
01:52:46.821 --> 01:52:50.540
<v Speaker 3>can take a lot of it and some people</v>
<v Speaker 3>can't and it's a matter of like how</v>

2561
01:52:50.541 --> 01:52:52.310
<v Speaker 3>strong you are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how used to it.</v>

2562
01:52:52.311 --> 01:52:54.290
<v Speaker 3>You are how accustomed you get to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>experience,</v>

2563
01:52:54.291 --> 01:52:56.540
<v Speaker 3>how much you practice resisting it</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you have to hook,</v>

2564
01:52:56.600 --> 01:52:58.850
<v Speaker 3>you have to hook,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to do little stuff where you're</v>

2565
01:52:58.851 --> 01:53:01.430
<v Speaker 3>forcing blood into your brain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's saint called hooking,</v>

2566
01:53:01.890 --> 01:53:05.990
<v Speaker 3>but I think that's a lot like that sort</v>
<v Speaker 3>of Michael Jackson superstar them level.</v>

2567
01:53:06.120 --> 01:53:07.580
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it just like the pressure</v>

2568
01:53:07.581 --> 01:53:12.560
<v Speaker 3>becomes so fucking overwhelming that</v>
<v Speaker 3>only a few people can hang in there.</v>

2569
01:53:12.561 --> 01:53:17.561
<v Speaker 3>Most people just elvis out just fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>blackout and pills and chaos and</v>

2570
01:53:18.820 --> 01:53:21.560
<v Speaker 3>shredding to the wheat field and gas</v>
<v Speaker 3>fires.</v>

2571
01:53:22.280 --> 01:53:24.200
<v Speaker 3>At least.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Elvis had an entertaining end though.</v>

2572
01:53:24.540 --> 01:53:25.510
<v Speaker 3>Cold.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A little trap.</v>

2573
01:53:26.770 --> 01:53:27.740
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>

2574
01:53:27.741 --> 01:53:29.060
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he went out,</v>

2575
01:53:29.110 --> 01:53:29.640
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

2576
01:53:29.640 --> 01:53:31.350
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they remastered one of his concerts,</v>

2577
01:53:31.351 --> 01:53:33.980
<v Speaker 3>his last concert in Vegas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're showing it in movie theaters</v>

2578
01:53:33.981 --> 01:53:34.700
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

2579
01:53:34.700 --> 01:53:36.140
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was an ad for when I went to see</v>

2580
01:53:36.141 --> 01:53:37.700
<v Speaker 3>star wars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking crazy,</v>

2581
01:53:37.701 --> 01:53:40.460
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's wild to see like it's like a time</v>

2582
01:53:40.461 --> 01:53:44.930
<v Speaker 3>capsule of Elvis on stage and he's kind</v>
<v Speaker 3>of overweight and he's sweaty and shit</v>

2583
01:53:44.931 --> 01:53:46.430
<v Speaker 3>and all these people going nutty for</v>
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>

2584
01:53:46.790 --> 01:53:47.571
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

2585
01:53:47.571 --> 01:53:49.370
<v Speaker 3>this was a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This was not that long.</v>

2586
01:53:49.400 --> 01:53:51.230
<v Speaker 3>You ever hear of extreme elvis?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2589
01:53:54.420 --> 01:53:57.220
<v Speaker 3>2002.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't do it anymore.</v>

2590
01:53:57.310 --> 01:53:58.760
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've gotten too much trouble,</v>

2591
01:53:58.761 --> 01:53:59.451
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a feminist.</v>

2592
01:53:59.451 --> 01:54:00.284
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really.</v>

2593
01:54:00.380 --> 01:54:02.540
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Told me he's a male feminist.</v>

2594
01:54:02.750 --> 01:54:04.420
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm one of the argument with me about it</v>

2595
01:54:04.421 --> 01:54:06.320
<v Speaker 3>and debate then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good luck.</v>

2596
01:54:06.820 --> 01:54:11.820
<v Speaker 3>We're not interested in seeing how much</v>
<v Speaker 3>things weigh.</v>

2597
01:54:12.150 --> 01:54:13.670
<v Speaker 3>Doesn't do that anymore either.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think.</v>

2598
01:54:13.870 --> 01:54:15.840
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I mean everything that,</v>

<v Speaker 3>be on stage and just get blast.</v>

2601
01:54:21.840 --> 01:54:25.220

<v Speaker 3>musician and so we're the band members</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the music was fucking good.</v>

2606
01:54:33.570 --> 01:54:35.460
<v Speaker 3>He sounded like fucking Elvis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 3>in her mouth and it's like this micro</v>

2609
01:54:42.171 --> 01:54:43.010
<v Speaker 3>penis and he pulls out.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I mean it's a micro penis and he's</v>
<v Speaker 3>pissing in her mouth on stage because</v>

<v Speaker 3>There was at one point in time,</v>

2619
01:55:00.861 --> 01:55:05.810
<v Speaker 3>he walked out into the audience and some</v>
<v Speaker 3>girl just started shoving a bottle up</v>

2620
01:55:05.811 --> 01:55:08.870
<v Speaker 3>his ass like a beer bottle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he starts backing up into the bottle</v>

2621
01:55:08.871 --> 01:55:11.780
<v Speaker 3>and then she panics and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and just gets out of there.</v>

2622
01:55:11.781 --> 01:55:13.380
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She would drop the ball a what?</v>

2623
01:55:13.400 --> 01:55:14.300
<v Speaker 3>But when he tried,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>

2624
01:55:14.301 --> 01:55:15.710
<v Speaker 3>that's the wrong holt's order.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We were hunting.</v>

2625
01:55:15.950 --> 01:55:19.490
<v Speaker 3>He like tried to help her stick this</v>
<v Speaker 3>beer bottle in his ass and that's what</v>

2626
01:55:19.491 --> 01:55:20.324
<v Speaker 3>she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>alright,</v>

2627
01:55:20.570 --> 01:55:22.490
<v Speaker 3>you when you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you took it too far,</v>

2628
01:55:22.520 --> 01:55:25.640
<v Speaker 3>they weren't willing to go to the same</v>
<v Speaker 3>extremes as extreme elvis,</v>

2629
01:55:26.060 --> 01:55:29.120
<v Speaker 3>but he was not getting paid for these</v>
<v Speaker 3>gigs because he was getting kicked out</v>

2630
01:55:29.121 --> 01:55:31.340
<v Speaker 3>and they would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would kick them out of there and he</v>

2631
01:55:31.341 --> 01:55:32.270
<v Speaker 3>would wonder why.</v>

2632
01:55:32.730 --> 01:55:35.360
<v Speaker 3>Strange.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well me and Stan Hope,</v>

2633
01:55:35.730 --> 01:55:36.670
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>

2634
01:55:36.680 --> 01:55:38.240
<v Speaker 3>we're both there alive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When it was,</v>

2635
01:55:38.270 --> 01:55:39.830
<v Speaker 3>it was like before we did the mantra was</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2636
01:55:39.831 --> 01:55:43.100
<v Speaker 3>so it had to be like 2002 and he was</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing it back then.</v>

2637
01:55:43.110 --> 01:55:44.580
<v Speaker 3>It was really good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2638
01:55:44.581 --> 01:55:48.420
<v Speaker 3>It was a good fucking show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like he was a really good singer and he</v>

2639
01:55:48.421 --> 01:55:51.120
<v Speaker 3>had great musicians and the girl could</v>
<v Speaker 3>sing her ass off,</v>

2640
01:55:51.240 --> 01:55:54.810
<v Speaker 3>like try replacing her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A girl who can sing her ass off and she</v>

2641
01:55:54.811 --> 01:55:58.470
<v Speaker 3>lets you piss in her mouth onstage</v>
<v Speaker 3>because that's like the whole thing is</v>

2642
01:55:58.471 --> 01:56:00.580
<v Speaker 3>that like everything about the act is</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2643
01:56:01.110 --> 01:56:04.170
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the thing can't even conceive of it.</v>

2644
01:56:04.290 --> 01:56:06.120
<v Speaker 3>He's got his pants off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2645
01:56:06.240 --> 01:56:10.350
<v Speaker 3>He's just pissed in her mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The fucking crowd is in chaos and he</v>

2646
01:56:10.351 --> 01:56:12.660
<v Speaker 3>sang suspicious minds and they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>singing along.</v>

2647
01:56:13.470 --> 01:56:15.950
<v Speaker 3>Singing all caught in a trap.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did it.</v>

2648
01:56:16.170 --> 01:56:17.400
<v Speaker 3>There's a little.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dick is out.</v>

2649
01:56:17.520 --> 01:56:18.930
<v Speaker 3>He's fat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's a girl.</v>

2650
01:56:18.960 --> 01:56:21.900
<v Speaker 3>The girls next to them saying she's got</v>
<v Speaker 3>piss on her fucking tits.</v>

2651
01:56:22.110 --> 01:56:25.910
<v Speaker 3>He pissed her mouth where you can't go</v>
<v Speaker 3>on together.</v>

2652
01:56:26.280 --> 01:56:27.930
<v Speaker 3>It was fucking amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was one of the best.</v>

2653
01:56:27.960 --> 01:56:32.580
<v Speaker 3>It was on the best show in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wish I could have seen some of that</v>

2654
01:56:32.581 --> 01:56:33.840
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need to be a club owner.</v>

2655
01:56:34.510 --> 01:56:36.120
<v Speaker 3>If I was a club owner.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I totally understand.</v>

2656
01:56:36.121 --> 01:56:37.110
<v Speaker 3>I'll be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see what you're doing there,</v>

2657
01:56:37.111 --> 01:56:37.944
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was great.</v>

2658
01:56:38.190 --> 01:56:40.380
<v Speaker 3>You just went for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could have just made him like the</v>

2659
01:56:40.381 --> 01:56:43.290
<v Speaker 3>House Act.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I connected him to Penn Jillette and he</v>

2660
01:56:43.291 --> 01:56:45.870
<v Speaker 3>performed a pendulum.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's where I heard about him.</v>

2661
01:56:45.871 --> 01:56:47.370
<v Speaker 3>I heard about him for Pendula.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2662
01:56:47.371 --> 01:56:49.140
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well I connected him with Penn.</v>

2663
01:56:49.300 --> 01:56:51.930
<v Speaker 3>Penn read my blog and penn contacted me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

2664
01:56:51.931 --> 01:56:52.530
<v Speaker 3>this guy real.</v>

2665
01:56:52.530 --> 01:56:53.850
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's amazing.</v>

2666
01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:58.230
<v Speaker 3>Because Penn came on fear factor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Penn and teller will bolt on fear factor</v>

2667
01:56:58.231 --> 01:57:01.440
<v Speaker 3>and I became friends with pen and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then he hired him,</v>

2668
01:57:01.441 --> 01:57:04.440
<v Speaker 3>but he made sure he was so he wanted him</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be sober because penn is.</v>

2669
01:57:04.650 --> 01:57:06.480
<v Speaker 3>Penn is no drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no alcohol,</v>

2670
01:57:06.481 --> 01:57:07.980
<v Speaker 3>no nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He just like,</v>

2671
01:57:08.010 --> 01:57:10.500
<v Speaker 3>he has parties on his house and he won't</v>
<v Speaker 3>let anybody do anything.</v>

2672
01:57:10.530 --> 01:57:13.050
<v Speaker 3>You have to go there and you have to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>totally straight,</v>

2673
01:57:13.710 --> 01:57:15.210
<v Speaker 3>which I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's an entertaining guy.</v>

2674
01:57:15.211 --> 01:57:16.500
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as long as you're around,</v>

2675
01:57:16.501 --> 01:57:19.410
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll stay sober if you promise.</v>

2676
01:57:19.530 --> 01:57:23.190
<v Speaker 3>Don't go anywhere if you to stay being a</v>
<v Speaker 3>stay being interesting.</v>

2677
01:57:24.300 --> 01:57:26.040
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think he doesn't anymore.</v>

2678
01:57:26.100 --> 01:57:26.790
<v Speaker 3>I think he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2679
01:57:26.790 --> 01:57:28.800
<v Speaker 3>he's out of the business now as far as</v>
<v Speaker 3>extreme elvis.</v>

2680
01:57:28.890 --> 01:57:30.150
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2681
01:57:30.151 --> 01:57:30.760
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

2682
01:57:30.760 --> 01:57:31.730
<v Speaker 3>He was as aware.</v>

2683
01:57:31.740 --> 01:57:34.680
<v Speaker 3>He'd been gone for awhile,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I didn't know the full story like</v>

2684
01:57:34.681 --> 01:57:36.080
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2685
01:57:36.081 --> 01:57:38.400
<v Speaker 3>I can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can say that elvis picture behind you</v>

2686
01:57:38.430 --> 01:57:41.610
<v Speaker 3>keep just like drawing my eye,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2687
01:57:41.850 --> 01:57:45.360
<v Speaker 3>I'll start focusing on that and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll become blurry and I'd be like,</v>

2688
01:57:45.361 --> 01:57:48.500
<v Speaker 3>oh shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was one of the few guys that was a</v>

2689
01:57:48.510 --> 01:57:51.150
<v Speaker 3>white guy that could rock sunglasses</v>
<v Speaker 3>indoors.</v>

2690
01:57:53.150 --> 01:57:54.690
<v Speaker 3>Look at that picture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2691
01:57:54.691 --> 01:57:56.190
<v Speaker 3>this fucking dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is tHat the white house?</v>

2692
01:57:56.450 --> 01:57:59.010
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's got a fake mug shot that's taken</v>

2693
01:57:59.011 --> 01:58:01.350
<v Speaker 3>out the white house and he's got his</v>
<v Speaker 3>sunglasses on.</v>

2694
01:58:02.430 --> 01:58:04.380
<v Speaker 3>He was a bad motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I agree,</v>

2695
01:58:04.710 --> 01:58:06.900
<v Speaker 3>but again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>too much g-force.</v>

2696
01:58:07.140 --> 01:58:08.850
<v Speaker 3>He spiraled out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hit the rocks,</v>

2697
01:58:08.880 --> 01:58:10.470
<v Speaker 3>died young.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They all do.</v>

2698
01:58:10.800 --> 01:58:12.480
<v Speaker 3>It's just too much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's too much.</v>

2699
01:58:12.481 --> 01:58:15.630
<v Speaker 3>I think there's a reason why miley cyrus</v>
<v Speaker 3>is sticking her tongue out and going</v>

2700
01:58:15.631 --> 01:58:17.820
<v Speaker 3>fucking bananas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's trying to stay above water.</v>

2701
01:58:18.050 --> 01:58:19.500
<v Speaker 3>That bitches just being overwhelmed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And</v>

2702
01:58:22.510 --> 01:58:23.940
<v Speaker 3>I think that's what happens to all of</v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

2703
01:58:23.970 --> 01:58:26.400
<v Speaker 3>It's just too much fame,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

2704
01:58:26.401 --> 01:58:29.310
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's why a lot of artists</v>
<v Speaker 3>go to shit.</v>

2705
01:58:29.490 --> 01:58:32.280
<v Speaker 3>That's what I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the fame overwhelms the</v>

2706
01:58:32.281 --> 01:58:36.420
<v Speaker 3>creativity and that becomes almost a</v>
<v Speaker 3>primary focus of your life is mitigating</v>

2707
01:58:36.421 --> 01:58:39.270
<v Speaker 3>the effects of fame versus just</v>
<v Speaker 3>experiencing life.</v>

2708
01:58:39.480 --> 01:58:42.340
<v Speaker 3>I think for artists especially whether</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a comic</v>

2709
01:58:42.370 --> 01:58:44.380
<v Speaker 5>or whether you're a musician or a</v>
<v Speaker 5>writer,</v>

2710
01:58:44.590 --> 01:58:48.790
<v Speaker 5>I think you have to experience life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You have to go out and do things by,</v>

2711
01:58:49.450 --> 01:58:54.450
<v Speaker 5>with this set idea in mind of enjoying</v>
<v Speaker 5>the moment and having life experiences</v>

2712
01:58:54.641 --> 01:58:58.720
<v Speaker 5>or being in the moment and not</v>
<v Speaker 5>constantly worrying about the business</v>

2713
01:58:58.960 --> 01:59:03.020
<v Speaker 5>or ticket sales or concert dates.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've</v>

2714
01:59:03.020 --> 01:59:06.770
<v Speaker 2>always surrounded myself with people who</v>
<v Speaker 2>are more pragmatic than myself so they</v>

2715
01:59:06.771 --> 01:59:08.600
<v Speaker 2>can worry about that shit because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2716
01:59:08.601 --> 01:59:11.120
<v Speaker 2>it's good to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't really conduct myself in that</v>

2717
01:59:11.121 --> 01:59:14.450
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't be concerned about like how many</v>

2718
01:59:14.451 --> 01:59:18.080
<v Speaker 2>views in the last video get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much money am I making this month?</v>

2719
01:59:18.800 --> 01:59:19.550
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2720
01:59:19.550 --> 01:59:23.150
<v Speaker 2>so especially if you start considering</v>
<v Speaker 2>in your creative process,</v>

2721
01:59:23.210 --> 01:59:24.500
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I can't do that,</v>

2722
01:59:24.501 --> 01:59:25.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to keep it separate.</v>

2723
01:59:25.731 --> 01:59:29.510
<v Speaker 2>So that's why I kinda like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kind of leach off of the</v>

2724
01:59:29.511 --> 01:59:33.860
<v Speaker 2>responsibility of other people because I</v>
<v Speaker 2>can't really be responsible myself.</v>

2725
01:59:33.861 --> 01:59:38.360
<v Speaker 2>I have to be very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like sort of a flighty and chaotic and</v>

2726
01:59:38.361 --> 01:59:42.710
<v Speaker 2>always just off doing my own thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like every once in a while my friend</v>

2727
01:59:42.711 --> 01:59:44.240
<v Speaker 2>ben,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll just look at me and be like,</v>

2728
01:59:44.270 --> 01:59:46.790
<v Speaker 2>jesus christ,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you a fucking cartoon character?</v>

2729
01:59:46.791 --> 01:59:51.791
<v Speaker 2>Because I'll just do weird shit that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>guess doesn't seem reasonable to him in</v>

2730
01:59:52.371 --> 01:59:52.880
<v Speaker 2>some way.</v>

2731
01:59:52.880 --> 01:59:57.350
<v Speaker 2>Like I just conduct myself in a strange</v>

2754
02:00:50.541 --> 02:00:53.030
<v Speaker 2>in because we're too late,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we already fucking checked in.</v>

2755
02:00:53.330 --> 02:00:55.340

<v Speaker 2>boarding passes.</v>

2756
02:00:55.460 --> 02:00:58.160
<v Speaker 2>All kinds of stupid shit happen.</v>

02:00:58.161 --> 02:01:00.230
<v Speaker 2>he's like the kind of guy that gets</v>
<v Speaker 2>really stressed about shit,</v>

2758
02:01:00.231 --> 02:01:04.040
<v Speaker 2>like hyperventilating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when things go wrong and the more</v>

2759
02:01:04.041 --> 02:01:06.620
<v Speaker 2>shit goes wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more he's panicking.</v>

2760
02:01:06.740 --> 02:01:08.960
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so he's really panicked.</v>

2761
02:01:09.020 --> 02:01:10.760
<v Speaker 2>He's in this fucking really agitated</v>
<v Speaker 2>state.</v>

2762
02:01:10.761 --> 02:01:14.690
<v Speaker 2>We're going through security,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's running to the fucking plane</v>

2763
02:01:14.691 --> 02:01:17.720
<v Speaker 2>because he knows like this motherfucker</v>

2764
02:01:17.721 --> 02:01:19.730

2765
02:01:19.731 --> 02:01:21.980
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he's running the onto the plane and</v>

<v Speaker 1>like you could upload a movie and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>could download it from your account so</v>

2847
02:04:27.711 --> 02:04:31.640
<v Speaker 1>you could take a pirated record,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sharp load online.</v>

2848
02:04:31.850 --> 02:04:36.100
<v Speaker 1>And so they made him responsible for all</v>
<v Speaker 1>this stuff that people uploaded.</v>

2849
02:04:36.110 --> 02:04:37.320
<v Speaker 1>He did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He invented that,</v>

2850
02:04:37.550 --> 02:04:38.310
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2851
02:04:38.310 --> 02:04:38.620
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2852
02:04:38.620 --> 02:04:39.720
<v Speaker 1>He didn't invent shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2853
02:04:39.740 --> 02:04:41.480
<v Speaker 1>there was plenty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was plenty of services doing it.</v>

2854
02:04:41.790 --> 02:04:45.270
<v Speaker 1>Google had their own version of services</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we're doing it for some reason.</v>

2855
02:04:45.271 --> 02:04:46.780
<v Speaker 1>This guy was the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2856
02:04:46.800 --> 02:04:49.200
<v Speaker 1>Why was that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why did he get in trouble?</v>

2857
02:04:49.260 --> 02:04:50.970
<v Speaker 1>Because he flaunted it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that what it was?</v>

2858
02:04:50.990 --> 02:04:52.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he flaunted it and he changed his</v>

2859
02:04:52.861 --> 02:04:55.560
<v Speaker 1>name to [inaudible] dot com.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He made a spectacle of himself.</v>

2860
02:04:56.340 --> 02:04:58.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He used to be called like kimball or</v>

2861
02:04:58.381 --> 02:05:01.170
<v Speaker 1>something like that and he used to have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We did this before,</v>

2862
02:05:01.230 --> 02:05:03.990
<v Speaker 1>remember jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we played some of his old animations.</v>

2863
02:05:04.710 --> 02:05:08.880
<v Speaker 1>You remember that it was kimbo or it</v>
<v Speaker 1>might've been kimbo.</v>

2864
02:05:08.881 --> 02:05:12.550
<v Speaker 1>He was calling himself before kimbo</v>
<v Speaker 1>slice kimbo or kimber or kimba,</v>

2865
02:05:12.960 --> 02:05:15.810
<v Speaker 1>I forget what it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he had this website way back in the</v>

2866
02:05:15.810 --> 02:05:20.700
<v Speaker 1>day when he was just like a really</v>
<v Speaker 1>resourceful hacker and he had like a</v>

2867
02:05:20.701 --> 02:05:24.570
<v Speaker 1>flash,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a suPer complex flash animated</v>

2868
02:05:24.630 --> 02:05:28.230
<v Speaker 1>opening to his website like way back in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the day and he was way,</v>

2869
02:05:28.231 --> 02:05:30.510
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>way ahead of the curve and he made these</v>

2870
02:05:30.511 --> 02:05:35.511
<v Speaker 1>like really funny little animated things</v>
<v Speaker 1>of him being in his mega car going to</v>

2871
02:05:36.091 --> 02:05:36.960
<v Speaker 1>his mega boat.</v>

2872
02:05:36.960 --> 02:05:39.900
<v Speaker 1>You remember all that kimball?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it was.</v>

2873
02:05:40.030 --> 02:05:41.820
<v Speaker 1>It does before he called himself</v>
<v Speaker 1>kim.com.</v>

2874
02:05:42.150 --> 02:05:42.961
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I mean like,</v>

2875
02:05:42.961 --> 02:05:44.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of easy to see why he gets</v>

2876
02:05:44.731 --> 02:05:45.780
<v Speaker 1>singled out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you got,</v>

2877
02:05:45.840 --> 02:05:47.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

2878
02:05:47.281 --> 02:05:49.860
<v Speaker 1>10 drug dealers and most of them are</v>
<v Speaker 1>really low key,</v>

2879
02:05:49.861 --> 02:05:53.790
<v Speaker 1>but one guy's out there like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm the fucking drug king Pin bitch,</v>

2880
02:05:54.230 --> 02:05:56.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who the fuck you is going to attract the</v>

2881
02:05:56.161 --> 02:05:57.330
<v Speaker 1>attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>

2882
02:05:57.510 --> 02:05:59.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2883
02:05:59.011 --> 02:06:02.340
<v Speaker 1>I mean it makes sense I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also he didn't have the benefit of</v>

2884
02:06:02.341 --> 02:06:05.820
<v Speaker 1>being attached to a giant company like</v>
<v Speaker 1>google or one of the other file sharing</v>

2885
02:06:05.821 --> 02:06:09.120
<v Speaker 1>companies and he probably wouldn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>provide the information that they would</v>

2886
02:06:09.600 --> 02:06:13.260
<v Speaker 1>provide about the people that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>uploading things because I would imagine</v>

2887
02:06:13.261 --> 02:06:15.810
<v Speaker 1>someone like google or someone like if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you upload something illegal,</v>

2888
02:06:15.811 --> 02:06:16.660
<v Speaker 1>they probably made.</v>

2889
02:06:18.030 --> 02:06:19.770
<v Speaker 1>They probably make it pretty transparent</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

2890
02:06:19.810 --> 02:06:21.540
<v Speaker 1>Gonna take your side over the</v>
<v Speaker 1>government's now.</v>

2891
02:06:22.080 --> 02:06:23.460
<v Speaker 1>Sorry dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got.</v>

2892
02:06:23.480 --> 02:06:25.560
<v Speaker 1>We're here to make money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You tripped us up.</v>

2893
02:06:25.770 --> 02:06:28.380
<v Speaker 1>So I wonder what's going to happen with</v>
<v Speaker 1>him because they took all his money,</v>

2894
02:06:28.381 --> 02:06:31.650
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean know what his current situation</v>

2895
02:06:31.651 --> 02:06:35.610
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I try to move them kind like a uh,</v>

2896
02:06:36.230 --> 02:06:38.340
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're trying to fly him to America.</v>

2897
02:06:38.520 --> 02:06:40.620
<v Speaker 1>It's been like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's been two years since I heard</v>

2898
02:06:40.621 --> 02:06:42.180
<v Speaker 1>anything about that case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't know.</v>

2899
02:06:42.870 --> 02:06:46.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm vice went and interviewed him fairly</v>

2900
02:06:46.201 --> 02:06:48.210
<v Speaker 1>recently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I want to say within the last year.</v>

2901
02:06:48.570 --> 02:06:52.320
<v Speaker 1>And I didn't see that he's got a</v>
<v Speaker 1>remarkably upbeat attitude about all</v>

2902
02:06:52.321 --> 02:06:53.640
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

2903
02:06:53.641 --> 02:06:58.641
<v Speaker 1>it's essentially one guy and whatever</v>
<v Speaker 1>organization he has left versus United</v>

2904
02:06:58.980 --> 02:07:00.870
<v Speaker 1>States government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the new New Zealand governments</v>

2905
02:07:00.871 --> 02:07:04.020
<v Speaker 1>complying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they gave up all his money and the whole</v>

2906
02:07:04.021 --> 02:07:06.250
<v Speaker 1>thing's kinda kinda reminds me of larry</v>
<v Speaker 1>flynt and away.</v>

2907
02:07:07.040 --> 02:07:10.560
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Flint seem like more of a victim because</v>

2908
02:07:10.561 --> 02:07:12.330
<v Speaker 1>there was no one who is being stolen</v>
<v Speaker 1>from.</v>

2909
02:07:12.331 --> 02:07:14.350
<v Speaker 1>There was no lost revenue by him</v>
<v Speaker 1>showing,</v>

2910
02:07:15.870 --> 02:07:17.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was still someone who was,</v>

2911
02:07:17.761 --> 02:07:20.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>agitating the,</v>

2912
02:07:20.910 --> 02:07:23.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not necessarily morality in the case of</v>

2913
02:07:23.131 --> 02:07:24.810
<v Speaker 1>kim dotcom but agitating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2914
02:07:24.840 --> 02:07:29.400
<v Speaker 1>the law abiding sector or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

2915
02:07:29.401 --> 02:07:33.780
<v Speaker 1>he was kinda like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they both got shit on and made a victim</v>

2916
02:07:33.781 --> 02:07:35.980
<v Speaker 1>of and just like almost was like a</v>

2917
02:07:35.980 --> 02:07:40.630
<v Speaker 2>one man show down against the entire</v>
<v Speaker 2>government and both of those situations</v>

2918
02:07:41.020 --> 02:07:41.990
<v Speaker 2>and.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

2919
02:07:42.040 --> 02:07:44.140
<v Speaker 2>movie star at a courtney love.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2920
02:07:44.380 --> 02:07:45.710
<v Speaker 2>I think larry flynt was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2921
02:07:46.160 --> 02:07:48.640
<v Speaker 2>was probably a more of a victim though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're probably right about that.</v>

2922
02:07:48.700 --> 02:07:49.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't seem like there's any</v>

2923
02:07:49.991 --> 02:07:52.840
<v Speaker 2>arguments good in that she was playing a</v>
<v Speaker 2>heroin junkie.</v>

2924
02:07:52.841 --> 02:07:55.710
<v Speaker 2>So vain and it's probably not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you see the church?</v>

2925
02:07:56.400 --> 02:07:57.233
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't seen it yet.</v>

2926
02:07:57.550 --> 02:07:59.100
<v Speaker 3>I saw the other night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>

2927
02:07:59.820 --> 02:08:00.470
<v Speaker 3>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it,</v>

2928
02:08:00.470 --> 02:08:02.160
<v Speaker 3>is it like a conspiracy thing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ah,</v>

2929
02:08:02.190 --> 02:08:04.550
<v Speaker 3>it's the conspiracy where they believed</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

2930
02:08:04.551 --> 02:08:06.810
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>courtney love had kurt cobain killed or</v>

2931
02:08:06.811 --> 02:08:09.960
<v Speaker 3>was involved somehow or another in his</v>
<v Speaker 3>murder and that she had.</v>

2932
02:08:10.730 --> 02:08:13.650
<v Speaker 3>There's evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They believe that she forged his,</v>

2933
02:08:13.651 --> 02:08:15.270
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his death letter,</v>

2934
02:08:15.660 --> 02:08:20.090
<v Speaker 3>her know I've heard the suicide note</v>
<v Speaker 3>forging thing when you listen to like</v>

2935
02:08:20.100 --> 02:08:22.500
<v Speaker 3>the recordings that he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2936
02:08:22.501 --> 02:08:26.580
<v Speaker 3>the private investigator has with her</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you get a glimpse into her mindset.</v>

2937
02:08:26.581 --> 02:08:27.414
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ooh.</v>

2938
02:08:27.930 --> 02:08:31.020
<v Speaker 3>Like they fucked up either whether she</v>
<v Speaker 3>was innocent or not.</v>

2939
02:08:31.050 --> 02:08:33.420
<v Speaker 3>They absolutely fucked up the burden</v>
<v Speaker 3>investigation.</v>

2940
02:08:33.570 --> 02:08:35.040
<v Speaker 3>The murder investigation was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or the,</v>

2941
02:08:35.070 --> 02:08:36.750
<v Speaker 3>excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the death investigation,</v>

2942
02:08:36.751 --> 02:08:38.730
<v Speaker 3>suicide investigation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They fucked it up.</v>

2943
02:08:38.731 --> 02:08:40.920
<v Speaker 3>Like they ruled it a suicide before the</v>
<v Speaker 3>coroner did.</v>

2944
02:08:41.180 --> 02:08:43.560
<v Speaker 3>Like there was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was so much of it that varied from</v>

2945
02:08:43.561 --> 02:08:46.830
<v Speaker 3>the first responder,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like his version of the scene versus</v>

2946
02:08:46.860 --> 02:08:47.610
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2947
02:08:47.610 --> 02:08:49.620
<v Speaker 3>the police department's version of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>scene.</v>

2948
02:08:49.920 --> 02:08:52.060
<v Speaker 3>Like what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they compare,</v>

2949
02:08:53.160 --> 02:08:56.310
<v Speaker 3>compare the two stories.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The whole thing is it's definitely a</v>

2950
02:08:56.311 --> 02:08:58.470
<v Speaker 3>cluster.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fucking sheriff wound up getting fired</v>

2951
02:08:58.471 --> 02:09:01.820
<v Speaker 3>for some other in competence or fuckery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

2952
02:09:01.821 --> 02:09:04.770
<v Speaker 3>it's a very disturbing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very disturbing documentary.</v>

2953
02:09:04.820 --> 02:09:08.030
<v Speaker 2>But who knows how many cases the same</v>
<v Speaker 2>department had botched before they just</v>

2954
02:09:08.031 --> 02:09:10.850
<v Speaker 2>had this high profile one to botch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

2955
02:09:10.970 --> 02:09:13.280
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many people are sitting in prisons</v>

2956
02:09:13.281 --> 02:09:14.570
<v Speaker 2>right now that don't deserve to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>there?</v>

2957
02:09:14.571 --> 02:09:15.240
<v Speaker 2>Probably tonight.</v>

2958
02:09:15.240 --> 02:09:16.080
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot.</v>

2959
02:09:16.150 --> 02:09:17.040
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot.</v>

2960
02:09:17.400 --> 02:09:18.570

<v Speaker 2>what we're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you know,</v>

2988
02:10:19.831 --> 02:10:22.590
<v Speaker 2>if you want to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I'm mistaking any details of it,</v>

2989
02:10:22.591 --> 02:10:27.450
<v Speaker 2>the whole thing can be found in this</v>
<v Speaker 2>video I did called like the top 10,</v>

2990
02:10:28.020 --> 02:10:33.020
<v Speaker 2>a false rape accusations or something</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that because was,</v>

2991
02:10:33.500 --> 02:10:37.310
<v Speaker 2>it was basically all these people who</v>
<v Speaker 2>have gone to jail for rape allegations</v>

2992
02:10:37.311 --> 02:10:41.240
<v Speaker 2>that later turned out to be false or</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's got to be hundreds and</v>

2993
02:10:41.240 --> 02:10:41.240
<v Speaker 2>thousands.</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's terrifying.</v>

2996
02:10:43.430 --> 02:10:46.910
<v Speaker 2>The idea that people get locked up and</v>
<v Speaker 2>even executed for somethIng that they</v>

2997
02:10:46.911 --> 02:10:49.720
<v Speaker 2>had no part in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's terrifying.</v>

2998
02:10:49.721 --> 02:10:50.770
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2999

3005
02:11:03.801 --> 02:11:04.730
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

3006
02:11:04.770 --> 02:11:08.180
<v Speaker 2>in when I was living in Louisiana at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>time I was watching some local news shit</v>

3007
02:11:08.181 --> 02:11:10.190
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

3008
02:11:10.330 --> 02:11:14.930
<v Speaker 2>they wanted to do dna evidence to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a guy who was a in there for</v>

3009
02:11:15.200 --> 02:11:20.200
<v Speaker 2>rape and murder and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want a dna test done to prove my</v>

3010
02:11:20.391 --> 02:11:24.230
<v Speaker 2>innocence and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the da got on and said,</v>

3011
02:11:24.231 --> 02:11:28.490
<v Speaker 2>well we can't do that dna test because</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we do it and it turns out he is</v>

3012
02:11:28.491 --> 02:11:30.110
<v Speaker 2>innocent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we look bad.</v>

3013
02:11:30.980 --> 02:11:32.730
<v Speaker 2>Like that's literally like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3014
02:11:32.760 --> 02:11:35.150
<v Speaker 2>that's not the subutex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not like,</v>

3015
02:11:35.151 --> 02:11:35.660
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3016
02:11:35.660 --> 02:11:37.120
<v Speaker 2>we better come up with some bullshit</v>
<v Speaker 2>reason.</v>

3017
02:11:37.130 --> 02:11:38.420
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] will look bad if this</v>
<v Speaker 2>happens.</v>

3018
02:11:38.421 --> 02:11:41.690
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his overt reason for not doing the dna</v>

3019
02:11:41.691 --> 02:11:45.830
<v Speaker 2>test is maybe you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we might actually exonerate this guy and</v>

3020
02:11:45.831 --> 02:11:48.440
<v Speaker 2>make ourselves look like idiots who just</v>
<v Speaker 2>punished him for years.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's terrifying.</v>

3024
02:11:55.940 --> 02:11:58.160
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how that turned out though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

3025
02:11:58.260 --> 02:11:59.480
<v Speaker 2>you see that shit all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

3026
02:11:59.540 --> 02:12:01.850
<v Speaker 2>the justice system is fucked.</v>

<v Speaker 2>people having too much is fucked.</v>

3028
02:12:04.250 --> 02:12:07.070
<v Speaker 2>People having the power to decide who's</v>
<v Speaker 2>guilty and who's innocent based on</v>

3029
02:12:07.071 --> 02:12:09.350
<v Speaker 2>withholding information or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or releasing it.</v>

3030
02:12:10.120 --> 02:12:11.480
<v Speaker 2>Sensibility.</v>

3031
02:12:11.630 --> 02:12:14.510
<v Speaker 2>It's a really good question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But in that situation,</v>

3032
02:12:14.540 --> 02:12:17.150
<v Speaker 2>it's not a good system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a terrible system.</v>

3033
02:12:17.420 --> 02:12:20.850
<v Speaker 2>If they could withhold evidence and not</v>
<v Speaker 2>be god damn it.</v>

<v Speaker 1>him out to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This mom killed maybe like three or four</v>

3076
02:14:02.311 --> 02:14:04.200
<v Speaker 1>people maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who knows?</v>

3077
02:14:04.201 --> 02:14:04.801
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3078
02:14:04.801 --> 02:14:06.690
<v Speaker 1>he killed his mother for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe.</v>

3079
02:14:07.440 --> 02:14:08.540
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I Don't know.</v>

3080
02:14:08.800 --> 02:14:10.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm not positive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not one of these people that's</v>

3081
02:14:10.720 --> 02:14:13.410
<v Speaker 1>obsessed with serial killers and shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's just another example of like</v>

3082
02:14:13.890 --> 02:14:18.520
<v Speaker 1>law enforcement gone crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is in the movie fellow was a</v>

3083
02:14:19.410 --> 02:14:20.520
<v Speaker 1>really good movie though.</v>

3084
02:14:20.840 --> 02:14:22.290
<v Speaker 1>It's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an interesting movie.</v>

3085
02:14:22.620 --> 02:14:26.070
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in a lot of ways it reminded me of</v>

3086
02:14:26.071 --> 02:14:30.990
<v Speaker 1>that fucked up movie where brad pitt</v>
<v Speaker 1>played was a California where brad pitt</v>

3087
02:14:31.050 --> 02:14:33.180
<v Speaker 1>played a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a serial killer.</v>

3088
02:14:34.080 --> 02:14:35.880
<v Speaker 1>So with California,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a k?</v>

3089
02:14:35.881 --> 02:14:36.451
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3090
02:14:36.451 --> 02:14:37.560
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a,</v>

3091
02:14:37.561 --> 02:14:40.170
<v Speaker 1>it was a dark movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was fun because they didn't go with</v>

3092
02:14:40.171 --> 02:14:42.840
<v Speaker 1>the usual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like super genius serial killer either.</v>

3093
02:14:42.841 --> 02:14:44.450
<v Speaker 1>They made him kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3094
02:14:44.460 --> 02:14:46.780
<v Speaker 1>just a simple guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3095
02:14:46.890 --> 02:14:49.780
<v Speaker 1>Which is probably more likely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3096
02:14:49.800 --> 02:14:51.330
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess they say that serial killers</v>

3097
02:14:51.331 --> 02:14:54.780
<v Speaker 1>have above average iq was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the hannibal lecter archetype is not</v>

3098
02:14:54.781 --> 02:14:57.690
<v Speaker 1>really accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you see that fucking thing where</v>

3099
02:14:57.691 --> 02:15:02.460
<v Speaker 1>they showed that more money has been</v>
<v Speaker 1>taken from americans from the police</v>

3100
02:15:02.640 --> 02:15:05.670
<v Speaker 1>then from burglars in 2015?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't surprise me.</v>

3101
02:15:05.910 --> 02:15:09.160
<v Speaker 1>There's plenty of laws.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's plenty of laws that say you can,</v>

3102
02:15:09.360 --> 02:15:10.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3103
02:15:11.010 --> 02:15:13.650
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the amount is or how</v>
<v Speaker 1>many states allow this,</v>

3104
02:15:13.651 --> 02:15:17.880
<v Speaker 1>but basically they can just sees any</v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of money up to a certain amount</v>

3105
02:15:17.910 --> 02:15:19.830
<v Speaker 1>or more than $1,000 or something.</v>

3106
02:15:19.830 --> 02:15:20.471
<v Speaker 1>He just say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3107
02:15:20.471 --> 02:15:22.090

<v Speaker 1>my dad was rIch and he would carry like</v>

<v Speaker 1>lot of times he was like stupid looking</v>
<v Speaker 1>silk shirts and shit.</v>

3117
02:15:46.770 --> 02:15:50.540
<v Speaker 1>He looked like some kind of decadent</v>
<v Speaker 1>roman emperor and he always had big</v>

3118
02:15:50.550 --> 02:15:54.810
<v Speaker 1>orgies at his house to dad is cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was cool.</v>

3119
02:15:55.170 --> 02:15:58.170
<v Speaker 1>What did he do for a living?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was pretty much a con man.</v>

3120
02:15:58.440 --> 02:15:59.550
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

3121
02:15:59.760 --> 02:16:04.140
<v Speaker 1>Where uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he started as a diploma mill called</v>

3122
02:16:04.170 --> 02:16:07.380
<v Speaker 1>lasalle university.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you?</v>

3123
02:16:08.580 --> 02:16:09.990
<v Speaker 1>Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe you,</v>

3124
02:16:10.020 --> 02:16:12.440
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3125
02:16:12.530 --> 02:16:13.920
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he just started.</v>

3126
02:16:13.950 --> 02:16:17.640
<v Speaker 1>He started a fake university degree</v>
<v Speaker 1>mill,</v>

3127
02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:20.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it kind of,</v>

3128
02:16:20.400 --> 02:16:25.230
<v Speaker 1>you could say in some ways maybe it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>fake or maybe it was just a precursor to</v>

3129
02:16:25.231 --> 02:16:28.550
<v Speaker 1>things like phoenix,</v>
<v Speaker 1>university of phoenix that just,</v>

3130
02:16:28.560 --> 02:16:30.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but his real problem</v>

3131
02:16:30.250 --> 02:16:33.520
<v Speaker 2>wasn't the school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was the government never went after</v>

3132
02:16:33.521 --> 02:16:35.260
<v Speaker 2>him and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're running a scam school.</v>

3133
02:16:35.261 --> 02:16:40.090
<v Speaker 2>The government went after him for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for committing mail fraud and for um,</v>

3134
02:16:40.630 --> 02:16:44.320
<v Speaker 2>a tax evasion was the big one because he</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't feel like he had to pay any taxes</v>

3135
02:16:44.770 --> 02:16:47.620
<v Speaker 2>they felt otherwise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he ended up in jail for,</v>

3136
02:16:47.621 --> 02:16:49.090
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3137
02:16:49.091 --> 02:16:53.230
<v Speaker 2>three or four years over that will</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually was sentenced to five years,</v>

3138
02:16:53.231 --> 02:16:55.840
<v Speaker 2>but then he claims to be a drug addict</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though he wasn't,</v>

3139
02:16:55.841 --> 02:17:00.130
<v Speaker 2>never did drugs and they gave him some</v>
<v Speaker 2>time off his sentence for enrolling in a</v>

3140
02:17:00.131 --> 02:17:02.020
<v Speaker 2>drug treatment program.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

3141
02:17:02.021 --> 02:17:04.030
<v Speaker 2>that's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was always lookIng for the angles.</v>

3142
02:17:04.031 --> 02:17:06.040
<v Speaker 2>I wish I had that ability like my dad</v>
<v Speaker 2>did.</v>

3143
02:17:06.070 --> 02:17:07.360
<v Speaker 2>Is he still around?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now?</v>

3144
02:17:07.361 --> 02:17:08.590
<v Speaker 2>He's dead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh.</v>

3145
02:17:08.600 --> 02:17:10.150
<v Speaker 2>Is your mom still around?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

3146
02:17:10.151 --> 02:17:11.610
<v Speaker 2>When you talked to your mom about him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3147
02:17:11.720 --> 02:17:13.150
<v Speaker 2>like how long were they together?</v>

3148
02:17:13.780 --> 02:17:14.800
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3149
02:17:14.810 --> 02:17:18.160
<v Speaker 2>I think about maybe eight or nine years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

3150
02:17:18.190 --> 02:17:20.710
<v Speaker 2>What a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what a blessed be like to be a woman and</v>

3151
02:17:20.711 --> 02:17:25.130
<v Speaker 2>to have a child with a crazy man who's</v>
<v Speaker 2>running around just scamming people and</v>

3152
02:17:25.510 --> 02:17:26.860
<v Speaker 2>hustling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

3153
02:17:27.340 --> 02:17:29.140
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't like he was really scamming</v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

3154
02:17:29.141 --> 02:17:32.410
<v Speaker 2>He was actually helping people to scam</v>
<v Speaker 2>employers.</v>

3155
02:17:32.411 --> 02:17:36.060
<v Speaker 2>If</v>
<v Speaker 2>they know the degree is fucking bogus.</v>

3156
02:17:36.070 --> 02:17:37.390
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a good point.</v>

3157
02:17:38.590 --> 02:17:40.960
<v Speaker 2>And actually it was crazy because when</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was exposed,</v>

3158
02:17:40.961 --> 02:17:45.820
<v Speaker 2>there was like congressman and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they got their degree,</v>

3159
02:17:45.840 --> 02:17:50.840
<v Speaker 2>like ceos of major companies that all</v>
<v Speaker 2>had degrees from lasalle university.</v>

3160
02:17:51.580 --> 02:17:54.400
<v Speaker 2>Super successful even with fake degrees.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3161
02:17:54.460 --> 02:17:55.780
<v Speaker 2>That's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3162
02:17:55.781 --> 02:17:57.880
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>degrees are bullshit anyway.</v>

3163
02:17:58.210 --> 02:18:01.330
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they certainly are not the only limiting</v>

3164
02:18:01.331 --> 02:18:03.220
<v Speaker 2>factor in someone's competency.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3165
02:18:03.221 --> 02:18:04.630
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially not for like business or</v>

3166
02:18:04.631 --> 02:18:06.880
<v Speaker 2>something science.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that's a different story.</v>

3167
02:18:06.910 --> 02:18:08.110
<v Speaker 2>I'll for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Medicine.</v>

3168
02:18:08.170 --> 02:18:09.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want a real document?</v>

3169
02:18:09.211 --> 02:18:10.090
<v Speaker 2>We don't want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3170
02:18:10.320 --> 02:18:14.330
<v Speaker 2>a doctor with a lasalle medical degree</v>
<v Speaker 2>with an incomplete idea and I don't</v>

3171
02:18:14.331 --> 02:18:15.190
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he,</v>

3172
02:18:15.191 --> 02:18:15.770
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

3173
02:18:15.770 --> 02:18:18.700
<v Speaker 2>he issued medical degrees though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3174
02:18:19.060 --> 02:18:21.880
<v Speaker 2>either way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not the most egregious example of</v>

3175
02:18:21.881 --> 02:18:23.420
<v Speaker 2>someone being a con person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not.</v>

3176
02:18:23.430 --> 02:18:24.071
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3177
02:18:24.071 --> 02:18:27.460
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's probably way worse things,</v>

3178
02:18:27.760 --> 02:18:29.020
<v Speaker 2>but you know what I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3179
02:18:29.320 --> 02:18:31.930
<v Speaker 2>But he was an interesting guy though and</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually,</v>

3180
02:18:31.931 --> 02:18:33.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when he was dying,</v>

3181
02:18:33.041 --> 02:18:35.470
<v Speaker 2>when he was on his death,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he died of a super massive heart attack</v>

3182
02:18:35.471 --> 02:18:37.540
<v Speaker 2>at the age of 61,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3183
02:18:37.541 --> 02:18:39.550
<v Speaker 2>basically I was sitting there at my</v>
<v Speaker 2>desk,</v>

3184
02:18:39.551 --> 02:18:42.190
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>working for him on whatever he was doing</v>

3185
02:18:42.550 --> 02:18:45.520
<v Speaker 2>and my step mom comes and she taps me on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the shoulder and she's like,</v>

3186
02:18:45.521 --> 02:18:47.590
<v Speaker 2>something is seriously wrong with your</v>
<v Speaker 2>father.</v>

3187
02:18:47.591 --> 02:18:52.591
<v Speaker 2>And I follow her and he's sitting there</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the bed and he's just like a,</v>

3188
02:18:53.790 --> 02:18:56.050
<v Speaker 2>I'm like a dad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you okay?</v>

3189
02:18:57.370 --> 02:18:58.270
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh shit.</v>

3190
02:18:58.271 --> 02:19:00.540
<v Speaker 2>We called nine slash 11,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3191
02:19:00.700 --> 02:19:02.020
<v Speaker 2>took him to the hospital,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that stuff.</v>

3192
02:19:02.021 --> 02:19:05.860
<v Speaker 2>And that was reallY the moment when he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>lying there in the hospital bed and</v>

3193
02:19:05.861 --> 02:19:06.820
<v Speaker 2>everyone's saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3194
02:19:06.821 --> 02:19:08.820
<v Speaker 2>he's fucked and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

3195
02:19:09.490 --> 02:19:10.810
<v Speaker 2>there's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3196
02:19:11.410 --> 02:19:13.390
<v Speaker 2>his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his wife is kind of align yourself and</v>

3197
02:19:13.391 --> 02:19:15.640
<v Speaker 2>saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll be laughing about this tomorrow,</v>

3198
02:19:15.641 --> 02:19:17.050
<v Speaker 2>but not really believe in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And shit.</v>

3199
02:19:17.130 --> 02:19:20.860
<v Speaker 2>Well she knew she was in the will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there was no will.</v>

3200
02:19:20.980 --> 02:19:22.120
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unfortunatelY.</v>

3201
02:19:22.121 --> 02:19:25.060
<v Speaker 2>But</v>
<v Speaker 2>anyway,</v>

3202
02:19:25.300 --> 02:19:30.300
<v Speaker 2>that was probably the only time in at</v>
<v Speaker 2>least my adult life that I ever prayed</v>

3203
02:19:30.831 --> 02:19:33.210
<v Speaker 2>or anything like that because I did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3204
02:19:33.230 --> 02:19:36.440
<v Speaker 2>even as a staunch atheIst and a strong</v>
<v Speaker 2>skeptic,</v>

3205
02:19:36.520 --> 02:19:39.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was emotionally moved enough at that</v>

3206
02:19:39.321 --> 02:19:43.520
<v Speaker 2>time to prostrate myself before I or</v>
<v Speaker 2>power and say,</v>

3207
02:19:43.760 --> 02:19:45.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if there is something out there,</v>

3208
02:19:45.890 --> 02:19:48.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>could you change this outcome?</v>

3209
02:19:48.290 --> 02:19:50.060
<v Speaker 2>Didn't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3210
02:19:50.860 --> 02:19:53.560
<v Speaker 2>maybe you didn't pray Hard enough or you</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't really believe I didn't really</v>

3211
02:19:53.561 --> 02:19:54.950
<v Speaker 2>see people right now that are mad at</v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

3212
02:19:55.130 --> 02:19:56.630
<v Speaker 2>I didn't pray hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you say that,</v>

3213
02:19:56.780 --> 02:19:57.920
<v Speaker 2>but we'll think about what you just</v>
<v Speaker 2>said.</v>

3214
02:19:58.010 --> 02:19:59.660
<v Speaker 2>How many people right now are going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be mad at you for that?</v>

3215
02:19:59.810 --> 02:20:02.180
<v Speaker 2>You call yourself the amazing atheist</v>
<v Speaker 2>because god took your dad.</v>

3216
02:20:02.690 --> 02:20:04.550
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was calling myself tHe amazing atheist</v>

3217
02:20:04.551 --> 02:20:06.590
<v Speaker 2>before that I know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but can imagine being the amazing</v>

3218
02:20:06.591 --> 02:20:10.790
<v Speaker 2>atheist and then in when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when the test comes from a where I</v>

3219
02:20:10.791 --> 02:20:12.830
<v Speaker 2>failed the test.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Luckily,</v>

3220
02:20:12.980 --> 02:20:15.890
<v Speaker 2>luckily atheism doesn't have any built</v>
<v Speaker 2>in tests or anything like that.</v>

3221
02:20:15.970 --> 02:20:17.250
<v Speaker 2>It does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I just.</v>

3222
02:20:17.300 --> 02:20:20.720
<v Speaker 2>What do you think about atheism plus is</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you are,</v>

3223
02:20:20.990 --> 02:20:21.501
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3224
02:20:21.501 --> 02:20:25.160
<v Speaker 2>if you're going to define sjw to people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got to define atheism plus to</v>

3225
02:20:25.161 --> 02:20:27.860
<v Speaker 2>people because if they don't know sjw,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they certainly don't know atheism.</v>

3226
02:20:27.860 --> 02:20:32.860
<v Speaker 2>Plus atheism plus is a very weird little</v>
<v Speaker 2>offset group of atheists who want to</v>

3227
02:20:34.401 --> 02:20:39.401
<v Speaker 2>connect atheism with a bunch of moral</v>
<v Speaker 2>and ethical beliefs.</v>

3228
02:20:39.800 --> 02:20:41.720
<v Speaker 2>So in other words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a cult.</v>

3229
02:20:42.440 --> 02:20:43.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

3230
02:20:43.070 --> 02:20:45.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's mostly a,</v>

3231
02:20:45.210 --> 02:20:47.240
<v Speaker 2>it's mostly just due to feminist</v>
<v Speaker 2>infiltration,</v>

3232
02:20:47.600 --> 02:20:52.100
<v Speaker 2>but If you look at what they've done to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the speaking circuit,</v>

3233
02:20:52.101 --> 02:20:57.080
<v Speaker 2>the atheist speaking straight like this</v>
<v Speaker 2>used to be like hot shit that attracted</v>

3234
02:20:57.081 --> 02:20:59.450
<v Speaker 2>thousands of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They wanted to see christopher hitchens.</v>

3235
02:20:59.451 --> 02:21:01.880
<v Speaker 2>They want to see richard dawkins,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they wanted to see sam harris.</v>

3236
02:21:01.881 --> 02:21:04.250
<v Speaker 2>They want to see daniel dennett.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want to see all these like big</v>

3237
02:21:04.251 --> 02:21:09.170
<v Speaker 2>towering intellectuals deliver this</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking iconic classic message and an</v>

3238
02:21:09.171 --> 02:21:12.200
<v Speaker 2>entertaining and compelling passionate</v>
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

3239
02:21:12.440 --> 02:21:15.800
<v Speaker 2>And now you look at the conferences and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's fucking,</v>

3240
02:21:16.490 --> 02:21:21.490
<v Speaker 2>I am a cis gendered white male and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>recognize that as such.</v>

3241
02:21:22.641 --> 02:21:25.310
<v Speaker 2>I have a lot of privilege here on this</v>
<v Speaker 2>panel.</v>

3242
02:21:26.390 --> 02:21:29.390
<v Speaker 2>It's gone from fucking christopher</v>
<v Speaker 2>hitchens to that.</v>

3243
02:21:29.391 --> 02:21:32.030
<v Speaker 2>And as a result,</v>
<v Speaker 2>attendance has dwindled.</v>

3244
02:21:32.031 --> 02:21:34.430
<v Speaker 2>It's shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These people still have something of an</v>

3245
02:21:34.431 --> 02:21:37.850
<v Speaker 2>online presence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mostly spearheaded by a guy named um,</v>

3246
02:21:37.880 --> 02:21:41.750
<v Speaker 2>pz myers a hates my guts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hates everybody.</v>

3247
02:21:41.751 --> 02:21:42.660
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3248
02:21:43.010 --> 02:21:44.510
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of hate coming from that</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>

3249
02:21:44.760 --> 02:21:46.790
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a very hateful fuck and you know,</v>

3250
02:21:46.791 --> 02:21:48.070
<v Speaker 2>I don't have no problem with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

3251
02:21:48.200 --> 02:21:51.080
<v Speaker 2>if you want to have atheism plus and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>want to be like,</v>

3252
02:21:51.530 --> 02:21:54.860
<v Speaker 2>we're atheism plus all this other shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fine by me,</v>

3253
02:21:54.920 --> 02:21:57.470
<v Speaker 2>have fun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

3254
02:21:57.610 --> 02:22:00.770
<v Speaker 2>you don't get to come to me and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're already to be atheism.</v>

3255
02:22:00.771 --> 02:22:05.771
<v Speaker 2>Plus thIs idea of shaming people into</v>
<v Speaker 2>changing or shaming people that somehow</v>

3256
02:22:07.311 --> 02:22:08.740
<v Speaker 2>or another you're writing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3257
02:22:08.780 --> 02:22:10.220
<v Speaker 2>that's how you become a warrIor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3258
02:22:10.430 --> 02:22:13.790
<v Speaker 2>You have to go out and attack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to shame people for their</v>

3259
02:22:13.910 --> 02:22:18.770
<v Speaker 2>differing viewpoints or sexist opinions</v>
<v Speaker 2>like big on sexism.</v>

3260
02:22:18.770 --> 02:22:20.540
<v Speaker 2>Very.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's like one of the number one,</v>

3261
02:22:20.570 --> 02:22:22.790
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>attacks they'll uh,</v>

3262
02:22:22.820 --> 02:22:26.610
<v Speaker 2>they'll use Is going after sexists like</v>
<v Speaker 2>and shaming them,</v>

3263
02:22:26.640 --> 02:22:28.470
<v Speaker 2>shaming them in some way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hurting them,</v>

3264
02:22:28.471 --> 02:22:30.870
<v Speaker 2>lashing out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>making them feel that pain.</v>

3265
02:22:31.020 --> 02:22:35.250
<v Speaker 2>And it seems like a way of bullying in</v>
<v Speaker 2>response to the bullying that they've</v>

3266
02:22:35.251 --> 02:22:36.990
<v Speaker 2>experienced,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like dave experience,</v>

3267
02:22:37.140 --> 02:22:39.150
<v Speaker 2>negativity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they've decided to turn that</v>

3268
02:22:39.151 --> 02:22:41.700
<v Speaker 2>negativity on people they feel deserve</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

3269
02:22:41.730 --> 02:22:43.140
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I noticed uses that bullying,</v>

3270
02:22:43.170 --> 02:22:48.170
<v Speaker 2>that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that shaming tactic to milo bEcause,</v>

3271
02:22:48.191 --> 02:22:48.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

3272
02:22:48.530 --> 02:22:48.930
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3273
02:22:48.930 --> 02:22:51.900
<v Speaker 2>he pulled this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he pulled something on your show where</v>

3274
02:22:51.901 --> 02:22:54.450
<v Speaker 2>he did this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this little bit where he's like,</v>

3275
02:22:54.840 --> 02:22:57.480
<v Speaker 2>you and him got in an argument maybe</v>
<v Speaker 2>about circumcision or something like</v>

3276
02:22:57.481 --> 02:22:58.560
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>

3277
02:22:59.070 --> 02:23:02.340
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe you of all people would</v>
<v Speaker 2>argue with me on,</v>

3278
02:23:02.370 --> 02:23:04.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he tried that same shit on our show.</v>

3279
02:23:04.560 --> 02:23:07.620
<v Speaker 2>So he has this weird thing where like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eh,</v>

3280
02:23:07.820 --> 02:23:09.690
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a really interesting rhetorical</v>

3281
02:23:09.691 --> 02:23:14.691
<v Speaker 2>trick because not only does it shame you</v>
<v Speaker 2>for not apparently being as extreme on</v>

3282
02:23:15.511 --> 02:23:19.950
<v Speaker 2>the issue as he is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it also bolsters itself is like,</v>

3283
02:23:19.951 --> 02:23:23.340
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>joe rogan doesn't even have the balls to</v>

3284
02:23:23.341 --> 02:23:27.270
<v Speaker 2>say what I milo yiannopoulos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Say the drunken peasants podcast doesn't</v>

3285
02:23:27.271 --> 02:23:31.470
<v Speaker 2>have the balls to say what I milo</v>
<v Speaker 2>yiannopoulos saying because I think it's</v>

3286
02:23:31.471 --> 02:23:33.820
<v Speaker 2>just a clever debating tactic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just he's,</v>

3287
02:23:33.920 --> 02:23:36.560
<v Speaker 2>he's trying to win and these guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when he's having fun,</v>

3288
02:23:36.670 --> 02:23:38.010
<v Speaker 2>it's effective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

3289
02:23:38.070 --> 02:23:39.840
<v Speaker 2>that's why I got to call that shit</v>
<v Speaker 2>because,</v>

3290
02:23:39.841 --> 02:23:41.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can't let them get away with it</v>

3291
02:23:41.251 --> 02:23:42.450
<v Speaker 2>forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see what you're saying.</v>

3292
02:23:42.451 --> 02:23:46.410
<v Speaker 2>If you only looked at him as being a</v>
<v Speaker 2>rational debate or I look at him as</v>

3293
02:23:46.411 --> 02:23:49.230
<v Speaker 2>being a theater.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's what he is.</v>

3294
02:23:49.231 --> 02:23:50.880
<v Speaker 2>His problem is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3295
02:23:51.010 --> 02:23:52.490
<v Speaker 2>on when he was on our show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3296
02:23:52.520 --> 02:23:54.270
<v Speaker 2>we had our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of our guys,</v>

3297
02:23:54.271 --> 02:23:55.830
<v Speaker 2>paul,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very popular,</v>

3298
02:23:55.831 --> 02:23:57.720
<v Speaker 2>I got a guy on our show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3299
02:23:58.200 --> 02:23:59.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>attacking his arguments,</v>

3300
02:23:59.960 --> 02:24:01.620
<v Speaker 2>treat them like you would treat any</v>
<v Speaker 2>other guests,</v>

3301
02:24:02.280 --> 02:24:06.180
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the milo fanboys or like how dare you</v>

3302
02:24:06.181 --> 02:24:09.300
<v Speaker 2>challenge the perfect walk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kick of by.</v>

3303
02:24:09.300 --> 02:24:12.240
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like he doesn't have perfect lodge.</v>

3304
02:24:12.241 --> 02:24:15.390
<v Speaker 2>I think he's a smart guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's an entertaining guy.</v>

3305
02:24:15.450 --> 02:24:17.640
<v Speaker 2>He's compelling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but eh,</v>

3306
02:24:17.780 --> 02:24:20.900
<v Speaker 2>he's not completely 100 percent</v>
<v Speaker 2>objective dicks.</v>

3307
02:24:21.440 --> 02:24:26.440
<v Speaker 2>So didn't know anybody is circumcision</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he hates his own sexuality too.</v>

3308
02:24:28.050 --> 02:24:29.690
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how much that's real.</v>

3309
02:24:30.580 --> 02:24:32.790
<v Speaker 2>I think it's real sincere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>

3310
02:24:33.350 --> 02:24:35.670
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to know when you delve into</v>
<v Speaker 2>religion with him too.</v>

3311
02:24:35.671 --> 02:24:37.410
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you guys got into that</v>
<v Speaker 2>very much.</v>

3312
02:24:37.411 --> 02:24:39.450
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty ridiculous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think that's.</v>

3313
02:24:39.500 --> 02:24:41.970
<v Speaker 2>I think that's connected though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you know the hustle.</v>

3314
02:24:42.330 --> 02:24:43.860
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he's sincere.</v>

3315
02:24:45.570 --> 02:24:47.250
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a hustle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a hustle.</v>

3316
02:24:47.770 --> 02:24:50.310
<v Speaker 2>I want to be conservative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to be respected and</v>

3317
02:24:50.311 --> 02:24:53.280
<v Speaker 2>conservative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Circles need to be down with the baby</v>

3318
02:24:53.281 --> 02:24:54.450
<v Speaker 2>jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to.</v>

3319
02:24:55.040 --> 02:24:58.920
<v Speaker 2>That's almost the only point of entry</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's undeniable.</v>

3320
02:24:58.921 --> 02:25:03.921
<v Speaker 2>You cannot be an atheist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got a staunch atheist advocate for</v>

3321
02:25:04.351 --> 02:25:06.780
<v Speaker 2>atheism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>plus being a republican.</v>

3322
02:25:06.810 --> 02:25:09.000
<v Speaker 2>They're not gonna let you in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you could be a gay guy.</v>

3323
02:25:09.120 --> 02:25:11.460
<v Speaker 2>He could be flamboyantly gay as long as</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a sense of humor,</v>

3324
02:25:11.520 --> 02:25:12.510
<v Speaker 2>batteries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fan,</v>

3325
02:25:12.600 --> 02:25:17.600
<v Speaker 2>and as long as you have plenty of self</v>
<v Speaker 2>loathing and wish you weren't and then</v>

3326
02:25:17.820 --> 02:25:18.680
<v Speaker 2>we'll let you in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3327
02:25:18.690 --> 02:25:21.510
<v Speaker 2>you know what we believe in jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One thing that kinda does go to what</v>

3328
02:25:21.511 --> 02:25:23.800
<v Speaker 2>you're saying is that when he on our</v>
<v Speaker 2>show,</v>

3329
02:25:23.801 --> 02:25:24.634
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3330
02:25:25.000 --> 02:25:30.000
<v Speaker 3>he specIfically told us like let's try</v>
<v Speaker 3>not to talk about religion too much and</v>

3331
02:25:30.400 --> 02:25:32.740
<v Speaker 3>when he did talk about religion and he</v>
<v Speaker 3>was very,</v>

3332
02:25:32.770 --> 02:25:36.610
<v Speaker 3>it was easily the most evasive subjects,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so maybe maybe you're onto something</v>

3333
02:25:36.611 --> 02:25:38.590
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He didn't want to get into it too much</v>

3334
02:25:38.591 --> 02:25:42.580
<v Speaker 3>with me either.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he would go to this whole thing</v>

3335
02:25:42.581 --> 02:25:46.870
<v Speaker 3>that judeo christian values or what this</v>
<v Speaker 3>country is founded upon and judeo</v>

3336
02:25:46.871 --> 02:25:49.750
<v Speaker 3>christian centered countries are the</v>
<v Speaker 3>best countries.</v>

3337
02:25:49.751 --> 02:25:54.010
<v Speaker 3>Like he had these talking points that he</v>
<v Speaker 3>did not want to debate or explore other</v>

3338
02:25:54.011 --> 02:25:58.150
<v Speaker 3>than repeat those premises and I felt</v>
<v Speaker 3>like there's a certain amount of him</v>

3339
02:25:58.210 --> 02:26:01.420
<v Speaker 3>that I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just give in to the fact that a lot of</v>

3340
02:26:01.421 --> 02:26:03.100
<v Speaker 3>his theater and I think he's</v>
<v Speaker 3>entertaining.</v>

3341
02:26:03.101 --> 02:26:06.310
<v Speaker 3>It's almost like his brand of gonzo</v>
<v Speaker 3>journalism.</v>

3342
02:26:06.460 --> 02:26:08.950
<v Speaker 3>She's bran of gonzo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Journalism is sort of this gay</v>

3343
02:26:09.160 --> 02:26:10.950
<v Speaker 3>self-loathing jesus believer.</v>

3344
02:26:10.950 --> 02:26:15.950
<v Speaker 3>Like he'll put stuff on twitter like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like something about people believing in</v>

3345
02:26:16.241 --> 02:26:18.220
<v Speaker 3>god.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The only smart people.</v>

3346
02:26:18.340 --> 02:26:20.470
<v Speaker 3>Like that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the whole sentence and people.</v>

3347
02:26:20.471 --> 02:26:21.760
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

3348
02:26:21.940 --> 02:26:25.450
<v Speaker 3>the fucking apes to start fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>banging against the cage and</v>

3349
02:26:25.451 --> 02:26:28.720
<v Speaker 3>appreciation and I imagined that he's</v>
<v Speaker 3>laughing while this is all going on.</v>

3350
02:26:28.721 --> 02:26:33.721
<v Speaker 3>I can't imagine that a guy who's as</v>
<v Speaker 3>rational as he is fact based and driven</v>

3351
02:26:34.780 --> 02:26:37.780
<v Speaker 3>as his arguments are about so many</v>
<v Speaker 3>different things when it comes to</v>

3352
02:26:37.781 --> 02:26:41.110
<v Speaker 3>arguing against social justice warriors</v>
<v Speaker 3>or whatever the fuck it is,</v>

3353
02:26:41.320 --> 02:26:45.380
<v Speaker 3>but it against religion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He has this giant blind spot and there's</v>

3354
02:26:45.400 --> 02:26:48.010
<v Speaker 3>the religion in question that he</v>
<v Speaker 3>chooses.</v>

3355
02:26:48.220 --> 02:26:51.310
<v Speaker 3>Thinks that he's an abomination,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it's preposterous.</v>

3356
02:26:51.640 --> 02:26:54.880
<v Speaker 3>I think intellectually you could make</v>
<v Speaker 3>the argument that it's not theater.</v>

3357
02:26:55.220 --> 02:26:59.050
<v Speaker 3>I believe he's theater.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he's the dangerous faggot tour.</v>

3358
02:26:59.051 --> 02:27:00.490
<v Speaker 3>He's havIng a fun time with this whole</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

3359
02:27:00.490 --> 02:27:03.880
<v Speaker 3>It's the whole thing is awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's awesome that the twitter</v>

3360
02:27:03.881 --> 02:27:05.950
<v Speaker 3>unverified have to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just fucking created a bigger</v>

3361
02:27:05.951 --> 02:27:07.840
<v Speaker 3>monster.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just threw gasoline on a fire.</v>

3362
02:27:07.841 --> 02:27:09.850
<v Speaker 3>They fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

3363
02:27:09.880 --> 02:27:11.680
<v Speaker 3>Why do you think they don't see shit</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that though?</v>

3364
02:27:11.710 --> 02:27:13.250
<v Speaker 3>Because they're assholes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just say they're too.</v>

3365
02:27:13.570 --> 02:27:16.630
<v Speaker 3>They're too blinded by what assholes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They are to realize that all they're</v>

3366
02:27:16.631 --> 02:27:19.330
<v Speaker 3>going to do is add to his popularity and</v>
<v Speaker 3>legend.</v>

3367
02:27:19.480 --> 02:27:24.480
<v Speaker 3>They must the people that made that</v>
<v Speaker 3>decision must harbor social justice</v>

3368
02:27:25.031 --> 02:27:27.130
<v Speaker 3>warrior ideals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is no question about it.</v>

3369
02:27:27.131 --> 02:27:29.530
<v Speaker 3>The other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no way other than that that you</v>

3370
02:27:29.531 --> 02:27:34.060
<v Speaker 3>could look at what he's doing and and</v>
<v Speaker 3>say that this is a guy that you should</v>

3371
02:27:34.090 --> 02:27:35.680
<v Speaker 3>unverified.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3372
02:27:36.070 --> 02:27:37.930
<v Speaker 3>yOu have to do something to get banned,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3373
02:27:37.931 --> 02:27:39.940
<v Speaker 3>If do something mean you have to harass</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone.</v>

3374
02:27:39.941 --> 02:27:41.950
<v Speaker 3>You Have to call someone problems.</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3375
02:27:42.190 --> 02:27:44.080
<v Speaker 3>someone can block you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so if you're bugging them,</v>

3376
02:27:44.110 --> 02:27:46.930
<v Speaker 3>they can block you and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>theoretically at least you're not</v>

3377
02:27:46.931 --> 02:27:49.000
<v Speaker 3>experiencing their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their bullshit anymore unless they start</v>

3378
02:27:49.001 --> 02:27:49.834
<v Speaker 3>new accounts.</v>

3379
02:27:49.910 --> 02:27:51.760
<v Speaker 3>So they didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they didn't ban him.</v>

3380
02:27:51.850 --> 02:27:53.440
<v Speaker 3>They just unverified him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3381
02:27:53.441 --> 02:27:55.930
<v Speaker 3>that doesn't make any fucking sense</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you know exactly who he is.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Verification it's supposed to be done.</v>

<v Speaker 3>supposed to be a badge of</v>

3393
02:28:22.190 --> 02:28:24.170
<v Speaker 2>approval or anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's supposed to be like,</v>

<v Speaker 5>Lot of really cool stuff is being</v>
<v Speaker 5>exchanged through twitter,</v>

3416
02:29:28.400 --> 02:29:33.400
<v Speaker 5>but you can't take a guy like that who's</v>
<v Speaker 5>so obviously entertaining and having fun</v>

3417
02:29:34.821 --> 02:29:37.820
<v Speaker 5>and fucking with people and has some</v>
<v Speaker 5>points that he actually believes in.</v>

3418
02:29:38.030 --> 02:29:40.790
<v Speaker 5>Where's he crossing a line?</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's not crossing a line where you can</v>

3419
02:29:40.791 --> 02:29:44.840
<v Speaker 5>ban him like he's not advocating</v>
<v Speaker 5>violence or hate or going after someone</v>

3420
02:29:44.841 --> 02:29:48.770
<v Speaker 5>or doxing them or doing something that</v>
<v Speaker 5>we would all agree is fucked up.</v>

3423
02:29:53.811 --> 02:29:55.490
<v Speaker 5>you're taking the little blue checklist</v>
<v Speaker 5>off</v>

3424
02:29:57.030 --> 02:29:59.130
<v Speaker 2>what I was asking you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand it.</v>

3425
02:29:59.430 --> 02:30:01.080
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3426
02:30:01.110 --> 02:30:02.730
<v Speaker 2>especially when you consider it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I said,</v>

3427
02:30:02.731 --> 02:30:05.590
<v Speaker 2>it's not a badge of approval.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not we endorse.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Are they saying that's not who he is</v>

3430
02:30:13.921 --> 02:30:17.190
<v Speaker 2>anymore or that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that being that is not notable.</v>

<v Speaker 2>growing twitter followings of all time.</v>

3441
02:30:44.021 --> 02:30:48.910
<v Speaker 5>this World and when people have</v>
<v Speaker 5>disagreements or different opinions</v>

3442
02:30:49.090 --> 02:30:51.880
<v Speaker 5>about certain subjects tHat are</v>
<v Speaker 5>controversial and pertinent because</v>

3443
02:30:51.881 --> 02:30:54.580
<v Speaker 5>we're all discussing them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whether it's men's rights or women's</v>

3444
02:30:54.581 --> 02:30:57.220
<v Speaker 5>rights or whatever the fuck it is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're going to have controversial</v>

3445
02:30:57.221 --> 02:31:00.070
<v Speaker 5>characters who stand out and their their</v>
<v Speaker 5>hot points of debate.</v>

<v Speaker 5>so you block them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's all fair play,</v>

3450
02:31:07.900 --> 02:31:10.450
<v Speaker 5>but it's as soon as they decide,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3491
02:32:54.361 --> 02:32:56.580
<v Speaker 2>identity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can succeed.</v>

3492
02:32:56.820 --> 02:33:01.050
<v Speaker 2>The people who define themselves as the</v>
<v Speaker 2>antithesis of me never going to succeed.</v>

3493
02:33:01.110 --> 02:33:04.920
<v Speaker 2>Well also define themselves as your</v>
<v Speaker 2>enemy and it's almost like their</v>

3494
02:33:04.921 --> 02:33:07.800
<v Speaker 2>individuality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their identity is based on being an</v>

3495
02:33:07.801 --> 02:33:12.450
<v Speaker 2>enemy with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just making yourself contingent upon me.</v>

<v Speaker 2>you give them poWer.</v>

<v Speaker 2>overwhelmingly positive.</v>

3508
02:33:36.361 --> 02:33:37.194
<v Speaker 2>deal.</v>

3509
02:33:38.850 --> 02:33:40.650
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes I'll say something to piss</v>
<v Speaker 2>people off,</v>

3510
02:33:40.800 --> 02:33:42.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the things that really had been like the</v>

3511
02:33:42.931 --> 02:33:46.050
<v Speaker 2>most offensive though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are never the things that I planned to</v>

3512
02:33:46.051 --> 02:33:47.460
<v Speaker 2>be the most difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you think?</v>

3513
02:33:47.800 --> 02:33:50.430
<v Speaker 2>All the videos you've ever done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's like the most defensive point</v>

02:33:50.470 --> 02:33:51.550
<v Speaker 2>I've taken?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's the.</v>

3515
02:33:51.990 --> 02:33:55.680
<v Speaker 2>Here's the three things that probably</v>
<v Speaker 2>piss people off the most</v>

3516
02:33:57.450 --> 02:33:58.830
<v Speaker 2>when I did a video.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3517
02:33:59.340 --> 02:34:02.580
<v Speaker 2>I did a video against ron paul once,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that was when I was a smaller</v>

3518
02:34:02.581 --> 02:34:06.270
<v Speaker 2>channel that really piss people off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did a video against buddhism.</v>

3519
02:34:06.300 --> 02:34:10.070
<v Speaker 2>People really pissed because they.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The strange thing about the boot boot,</v>

3520
02:34:10.100 --> 02:34:11.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would never think that for doing an</v>

3521
02:34:11.671 --> 02:34:14.040
<v Speaker 2>anti buddhist video,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would get death threats,</v>

3522
02:34:14.180 --> 02:34:17.070
<v Speaker 2>but I did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People were like,</v>

3523
02:34:17.920 --> 02:34:20.860
<v Speaker 2>you fucking misrepresented the tenants</v>
<v Speaker 2>of buddhism,</v>

3524

<v Speaker 2>bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I'm coming for you.</v>

3525
02:34:22.541 --> 02:34:25.240
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you understand them even less</v>

3526
02:34:25.241 --> 02:34:25.750
<v Speaker 2>than I do.</v>

<v Speaker 2>insulted soccer.</v>

3528
02:34:30.070 --> 02:34:35.070
<v Speaker 2>Even calling it soccer will piss a lot</v>
<v Speaker 2>of football fans off.</v>

3529
02:34:35.140 --> 02:34:36.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the european style.</v>

3530
02:34:36.591 --> 02:34:38.770
<v Speaker 2>If you get an american that gets mad at</v>
<v Speaker 2>you call it soccer.</v>

3531
02:34:38.771 --> 02:34:39.940
<v Speaker 2>He's a cunt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3532
02:34:40.120 --> 02:34:42.140
<v Speaker 2>Agreed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I would,</v>

3533
02:34:42.220 --> 02:34:44.740
<v Speaker 2>I've never lost more subscribers than</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I made a video.</v>

3534
02:34:44.741 --> 02:34:46.660
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>soccer when I said soccer is fucking</v>

3535
02:34:46.661 --> 02:34:48.730
<v Speaker 2>stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I must have lost.</v>

3536
02:34:48.731 --> 02:34:50.090
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3537
02:34:50.170 --> 02:34:51.400
<v Speaker 2>my channel probably had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

3538
02:34:51.401 --> 02:34:53.950
<v Speaker 2>a hundred thousand or 200,000 at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>time and I lost,</v>

3539
02:34:53.951 --> 02:34:56.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three or 4,000 people just for not</v>

3540
02:34:56.591 --> 02:34:58.930
<v Speaker 2>liking soccer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was really mean about it in all</v>

3541
02:34:58.931 --> 02:34:59.860
<v Speaker 2>fairness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I mean,</v>

3542
02:34:59.861 --> 02:35:00.940
<v Speaker 2>come on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's fucking soccer.</v>

3543
02:35:01.510 --> 02:35:04.750
<v Speaker 2>But why and others say the same thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>about baseball when I assaulted the</v>

3544
02:35:04.751 --> 02:35:05.830
<v Speaker 2>other kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

3545
02:35:05.920 --> 02:35:06.810
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They got this.</v>

3546
02:35:07.540 --> 02:35:09.310
<v Speaker 2>They got super pissed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>

3547
02:35:09.420 --> 02:35:11.890
<v Speaker 2>refresh your memory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Other kin is when we're talking about</v>

3548
02:35:11.891 --> 02:35:16.891
<v Speaker 2>people that think they're foxes or</v>
<v Speaker 2>computer elves or unicorn or a stapler</v>

3549
02:35:17.410 --> 02:35:18.730
<v Speaker 2>who fucking a golf shoe.</v>

3550
02:35:19.220 --> 02:35:21.890
<v Speaker 2>Fucking golf shoes and golf shoe kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mom.</v>

3551
02:35:21.920 --> 02:35:25.230
<v Speaker 2>The you easily could understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

3552
02:35:25.300 --> 02:35:28.540
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot astral cleats coming out</v>
<v Speaker 2>of my back.</v>

3553
02:35:28.570 --> 02:35:31.840
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of people out there that</v>
<v Speaker 2>are connected to these small</v>

3554
02:35:31.841 --> 02:35:35.260
<v Speaker 2>organizations they're very passionate</v>
<v Speaker 2>about and they don't like you just</v>

3555
02:35:35.290 --> 02:35:38.170
<v Speaker 2>sitting in your hive throwing up on</v>
<v Speaker 2>youtube and hitting all over.</v>

3556
02:35:38.930 --> 02:35:41.500
<v Speaker 2>The thing I got with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the other kid was they said that I</v>

3557
02:35:41.501 --> 02:35:45.790
<v Speaker 2>was a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was putting minors at risk because</v>

3558
02:35:46.210 --> 02:35:50.320
<v Speaker 2>some of the other canner minors and if I</v>
<v Speaker 2>make fun of them then they're going to</v>

3559
02:35:50.321 --> 02:35:53.950
<v Speaker 2>kill themselves and it's my fault</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I made fun of.</v>

3560
02:35:54.310 --> 02:35:57.010
<v Speaker 2>So basically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know the guy who goes around saying,</v>

3561
02:35:57.040 --> 02:35:58.990
<v Speaker 2>I'm a dragon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not the problem.</v>

3562
02:35:58.991 --> 02:35:59.771
<v Speaker 2>The guy that says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3563
02:35:59.771 --> 02:36:00.940
<v Speaker 2>you're not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

3564
02:36:01.260 --> 02:36:04.180
<v Speaker 2>that's the issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Strange logic.</v>

3565
02:36:04.450 --> 02:36:06.010
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3566
02:36:06.760 --> 02:36:10.450
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>making fun of something like other kids,</v>

3567
02:36:10.451 --> 02:36:13.510
<v Speaker 2>like someone who believes they're a fox,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a in a,</v>

3568
02:36:13.630 --> 02:36:17.590
<v Speaker 2>in a rational world is a very safe</v>
<v Speaker 2>practice.</v>

3569
02:36:17.710 --> 02:36:20.020
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And rational world that is like,</v>

3570
02:36:20.110 --> 02:36:22.360
<v Speaker 2>boy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's almost no victims there because</v>

3571
02:36:22.361 --> 02:36:25.330
<v Speaker 2>the person who really is a pretending</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're a fox,</v>

3572
02:36:25.331 --> 02:36:27.890
<v Speaker 2>they need to be slapped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone needs to wake up and hey,</v>

3573
02:36:27.940 --> 02:36:29.500
<v Speaker 2>fuck face your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

3574
02:36:29.530 --> 02:36:31.810
<v Speaker 2>your name is mike.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You live in toledo.</v>

3575
02:36:31.811 --> 02:36:33.430
<v Speaker 2>You're not a fox.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're a guy.</v>

3576
02:36:33.460 --> 02:36:34.660
<v Speaker 2>This is your mom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does your dad.</v>

3577
02:36:34.661 --> 02:36:35.980
<v Speaker 2>He goes to school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you talk to people,</v>

3578
02:36:36.070 --> 02:36:37.610
<v Speaker 2>you drive a fucking car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know how to fox.</v>

3579
02:36:37.660 --> 02:36:38.830
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you agree with me on</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

3580
02:36:38.831 --> 02:36:42.890
<v Speaker 2>but I mean if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if mike wants to be a furry and pretend</v>

3581
02:36:42.891 --> 02:36:46.780
<v Speaker 2>these a fox,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he knows it's pretend I'm okay.</v>

3582
02:36:46.810 --> 02:36:49.270
<v Speaker 2>I'm okay with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And even if he wants to be a fox for</v>

3583
02:36:49.271 --> 02:36:51.190
<v Speaker 2>short periods of time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like really</v>

3584
02:36:53.030 --> 02:36:55.660
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't even think he's mike,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mike at all.</v>

3585
02:36:55.661 --> 02:36:57.310
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's cathartic release.</v>

3586
02:36:57.311 --> 02:37:00.820
<v Speaker 2>Like he does get naked and he fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>runs through the woods on all fours and</v>

3587
02:37:00.821 --> 02:37:05.160
<v Speaker 2>it really does feel like a fox freedom</v>
<v Speaker 2>to have fun.</v>

3588
02:37:05.200 --> 02:37:08.290
<v Speaker 2>Why not turn live dance?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's 24 slash seven thinking you're a</v>

3589
02:37:08.291 --> 02:37:11.410
<v Speaker 2>fox,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like in the grocery store walking down</v>

3590
02:37:11.411 --> 02:37:13.510
<v Speaker 2>the aisle with your fucking cart or</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

3591
02:37:13.511 --> 02:37:15.260
<v Speaker 2>I'm a fox.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3592
02:37:15.320 --> 02:37:16.153
<v Speaker 2>that's rude.</v>

3593
02:37:16.430 --> 02:37:17.360
<v Speaker 1>That's just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3594
02:37:17.361 --> 02:37:19.340
<v Speaker 1>you know what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a dummy in.</v>

3595
02:37:19.450 --> 02:37:20.590
<v Speaker 1>There's plenty of dummies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3596
02:37:20.591 --> 02:37:23.580
<v Speaker 1>you find other things to do just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But anyway,</v>

3597
02:37:23.590 --> 02:37:26.710
<v Speaker 1>I had away from that guy chairman to</v>
<v Speaker 1>leave them alone though because uh,</v>

3598
02:37:26.760 --> 02:37:28.430
<v Speaker 1>there are a little bit too extreme for</v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

3599
02:37:28.980 --> 02:37:33.440
<v Speaker 1>They're upset because again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being this other kin as we discussed</v>

3600
02:37:33.441 --> 02:37:34.880
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is this tiny,</v>

3601
02:37:34.910 --> 02:37:37.550
<v Speaker 1>minor personal victory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they can say,</v>

3602
02:37:37.551 --> 02:37:39.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm a fox,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am fox kin,</v>

3603
02:37:39.350 --> 02:37:43.660
<v Speaker 1>like now if you agree to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now all of a sudden they've gained some</v>

3604
02:37:43.661 --> 02:37:45.310
<v Speaker 1>traction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've got some motion going on.</v>

3605
02:37:45.340 --> 02:37:48.020
<v Speaker 1>It's otherwise dismal life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's real.</v>

3606
02:37:48.021 --> 02:37:50.630
<v Speaker 1>It's like it hurts to suck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3607
02:37:51.590 --> 02:37:56.590
<v Speaker 1>to be stuck in some horrible existence</v>
<v Speaker 1>where the thing that gives you the most</v>

3608
02:37:56.661 --> 02:37:58.940
<v Speaker 1>joy is pretending you're a chipmunk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

3609
02:37:58.941 --> 02:38:00.430
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but pretending you're chipmunk,</v>

3610
02:38:00.470 --> 02:38:04.490
<v Speaker 1>ken and that you'd meet up with other</v>
<v Speaker 1>chipmunk king online and like how often</v>

<v Speaker 1>together and you fucking sit on your</v>

3612
02:38:07.671 --> 02:38:11.930
<v Speaker 1>knees and the park and you pretend to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>a chipmunk and you enjoy the shit out of</v>

02:38:12.230 --> 02:38:14.180
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is it okay to golf?</v>

3615
02:38:14.210 --> 02:38:17.090
<v Speaker 1>But that's not okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Golfing is way fucking dumber than</v>

3616
02:38:17.091 --> 02:38:19.100
<v Speaker 1>pretending to be a chipmunk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While we agree on that,</v>

3617
02:38:21.980 --> 02:38:23.900
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're playing pretend to be a</v>

<v Speaker 1>Pretending to be a chipmunk will be fun.</v>

<v Speaker 1>you don't.</v>

3624
02:38:40.640 --> 02:38:43.700

<v Speaker 1>he told me that he'll go golfing with</v>

3625
02:38:43.701 --> 02:38:46.460
<v Speaker 1>his buddy and his buddy won't say that</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's going to bring his wife and then</v>

<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

3637

3641
02:39:22.550 --> 02:39:23.061
<v Speaker 1>I don't really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm.</v>

3642
02:39:23.061 --> 02:39:24.940
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm very solitary in general,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>

3643
02:39:26.180 --> 02:39:27.940
<v Speaker 1>So when you go out and you just hang out</v>
<v Speaker 1>with me,</v>

3644
02:39:27.960 --> 02:39:30.950
<v Speaker 1>I guess I just disagree because I don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>really have.</v>

3645
02:39:31.190 --> 02:39:31.851
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me see.</v>

3646
02:39:31.851 --> 02:39:33.950
<v Speaker 1>How many friends do I have?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have always had with golfing.</v>

3647
02:39:34.040 --> 02:39:35.390
<v Speaker 1>Ben,</v>
<v Speaker 1>scotty,</v>

3648
02:39:36.140 --> 02:39:38.750
<v Speaker 1>chelsea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty much my three friends.</v>

3649
02:39:39.350 --> 02:39:41.030
<v Speaker 1>Those are dudes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3650
02:39:41.430 --> 02:39:44.060
<v Speaker 1>Is it a handler?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chelsea handler and hanging out with</v>

3651
02:39:44.061 --> 02:39:45.980
<v Speaker 1>her?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chelsea is my girlfriend.</v>

3652
02:39:46.640 --> 02:39:49.190
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And yeah,</v>

3653
02:39:49.191 --> 02:39:50.024
<v Speaker 1>I mean uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3654
02:39:50.090 --> 02:39:52.190
<v Speaker 1>I had a broader here if I could bring</v>
<v Speaker 1>her to la.</v>

3655
02:39:52.191 --> 02:39:54.620
<v Speaker 1>So I guess I am one of those dudes that</v>
<v Speaker 1>just would bring her everywhere,</v>

3656
02:39:54.670 --> 02:39:58.580
<v Speaker 1>but there's no but I can't see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't see her ever being like I was</v>

3657
02:39:58.581 --> 02:40:01.550
<v Speaker 1>offended by the us or some shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like yeah,</v>

3658
02:40:01.551 --> 02:40:03.470
<v Speaker 1>it's all dependent upon whether or not</v>
<v Speaker 1>your chickens cool.</v>

3659
02:40:03.490 --> 02:40:05.300
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I have friends who bring their girl</v>

3660
02:40:05.301 --> 02:40:07.100
<v Speaker 1>everywhere and it's awesome because</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's fun to hang with.</v>

3661
02:40:07.250 --> 02:40:09.670
<v Speaker 1>It's when they bring their mom out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean their girlfriends,</v>

3662
02:40:09.671 --> 02:40:11.630
<v Speaker 1>like their mom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are dudes that have that sort of</v>

3663
02:40:11.631 --> 02:40:14.400
<v Speaker 1>weird situation where a sorta tells them</v>
<v Speaker 1>what to do.</v>

3664
02:40:14.640 --> 02:40:16.350
<v Speaker 1>Fuck that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That becomes an issue.</v>

3665
02:40:16.380 --> 02:40:18.900
<v Speaker 1>But I guess girls have the same thing to</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine being a check.</v>

3666
02:40:19.050 --> 02:40:23.500
<v Speaker 1>You want to have some cool fucking thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this dummy brings her husband and I</v>

3667
02:40:23.890 --> 02:40:27.240
<v Speaker 1>know is your party.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't imagine myself being fun to</v>

3668
02:40:27.241 --> 02:40:30.520
<v Speaker 1>bring places because all I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all I do is just bitched and complained</v>

3669
02:40:30.580 --> 02:40:31.413
<v Speaker 1>yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's entertaining.</v>

3670
02:40:31.460 --> 02:40:32.820
<v Speaker 1>That's what you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fun.</v>

3671
02:40:33.660 --> 02:40:36.120
<v Speaker 1>It's fun for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I could see how someone else would</v>

3672
02:40:36.121 --> 02:40:37.410
<v Speaker 1>just be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my god,</v>

3673
02:40:37.411 --> 02:40:38.970
<v Speaker 1>you just second out of the fun out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

3674
02:40:38.971 --> 02:40:41.490
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's no fun to be had here</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's what I'm pointing out.</v>

3675
02:40:41.580 --> 02:40:42.990
<v Speaker 1>Fuck them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3676
02:40:43.200 --> 02:40:45.330
<v Speaker 1>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Other people that enjoy it and you have</v>

3677
02:40:45.331 --> 02:40:47.700
<v Speaker 1>a nice whole conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you and me we're at a party and</v>

3678
02:40:47.701 --> 02:40:49.560
<v Speaker 1>we met,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we started talking about shit.</v>

3679
02:40:49.590 --> 02:40:52.680
<v Speaker 1>We would have probably the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation whether or not there was a</v>

3680
02:40:52.710 --> 02:40:54.090
<v Speaker 1>recording of us at all.</v>

3681
02:40:55.260 --> 02:40:56.093
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3682
02:40:56.130 --> 02:40:58.110
<v Speaker 1>true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm saying,</v>

3683
02:40:58.111 --> 02:40:59.120
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all good.</v>

3684
02:40:59.130 --> 02:41:00.660
<v Speaker 1>Fuck those other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck them all.</v>

3685
02:41:00.690 --> 02:41:01.670
<v Speaker 1>Fuck them all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do.</v>

3686
02:41:02.140 --> 02:41:07.140
<v Speaker 1>You're the amazing atheist trying to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>away from that name that I know cause</v>

3687
02:41:07.411 --> 02:41:09.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not because a,</v>

3688
02:41:09.360 --> 02:41:11.670
<v Speaker 1>it's not because I mean like I'm not an</v>
<v Speaker 1>atheist anymore.</v>

3689
02:41:11.671 --> 02:41:13.740
<v Speaker 1>It's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't fucking know what else to say.</v>

3690
02:41:13.860 --> 02:41:16.260
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you're kind of tied into that name,</v>

3691
02:41:16.350 --> 02:41:17.190
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3692
02:41:17.310 --> 02:41:20.190
<v Speaker 1>So I'm kind of trying to phase it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you do that?</v>

3693
02:41:20.280 --> 02:41:21.960
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to be like p diddy.</v>

3694
02:41:22.200 --> 02:41:23.670
<v Speaker 1>He used to be puff daddy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3695
02:41:23.680 --> 02:41:25.470
<v Speaker 1>and then he'd hit a jarring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3696
02:41:25.471 --> 02:41:27.210
<v Speaker 1>people you should do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like people don't like that,</v>

3697
02:41:27.211 --> 02:41:28.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you just suddenly changed.</v>

3698
02:41:28.980 --> 02:41:33.980
<v Speaker 1>I just figure I'll use tj and amazing</v>
<v Speaker 1>atheist interchangeably long enough that</v>

3699
02:41:34.051 --> 02:41:35.820
<v Speaker 1>eventually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3700
02:41:35.821 --> 02:41:36.510
<v Speaker 1>they won't notice.</v>

3701
02:41:36.510 --> 02:41:38.970
<v Speaker 1>I'm not using the amazing agency.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you should have two different</v>

3702
02:41:38.971 --> 02:41:40.920
<v Speaker 1>outfits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like one you should wear,</v>

3703
02:41:40.921 --> 02:41:44.190
<v Speaker 1>like maybe some sort of spandex yoga</v>
<v Speaker 1>type outfit,</v>

3704
02:41:44.191 --> 02:41:47.640
<v Speaker 1>like a superhero would with a they want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to see my physique,</v>

3705
02:41:47.670 --> 02:41:50.430
<v Speaker 1>but I do just for the sake of this</v>
<v Speaker 1>character,</v>

3706
02:41:50.431 --> 02:41:53.670
<v Speaker 1>like you have two a's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like an a amazing atheist and it's like</v>

3707
02:41:53.671 --> 02:41:58.671
<v Speaker 1>a character that you play and then you</v>
<v Speaker 1>bring in tj and maybe you could have a</v>

3708
02:41:58.681 --> 02:42:01.190
<v Speaker 1>split screen where tj and the amazing</v>
<v Speaker 1>atheist can.</v>

3709
02:42:02.010 --> 02:42:03.990
<v Speaker 1>Can have different points of view.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

3710
02:42:04.050 --> 02:42:07.550
<v Speaker 1>It would be like two different fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>versions.</v>

3711
02:42:07.560 --> 02:42:11.470
<v Speaker 1>You remember when garth brooks became</v>
<v Speaker 1>chris gaines do remember that?</v>

3712
02:42:11.471 --> 02:42:12.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I'm talking about.</v>

3713
02:42:12.511 --> 02:42:16.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like the edgy garth brooks.</v>

3714
02:42:16.490 --> 02:42:17.940
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't even the edgy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Garth brooks.</v>

3715
02:42:18.000 --> 02:42:20.400
<v Speaker 1>He was made a behind the music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember that?</v>

3716
02:42:20.430 --> 02:42:23.310
<v Speaker 1>Edgy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it wasn't at garth brooks at all.</v>

3717
02:42:23.310 --> 02:42:24.870
<v Speaker 1>They made a fake pack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
