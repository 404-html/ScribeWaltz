1
00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:07.410
<v Speaker 1>Silver worked real good experience by </v>
<v Speaker 1>request of Dr.</v>

2
00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:16.050
<v Speaker 1>Rhonda.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Patrick.</v>

3
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.670
<v Speaker 1>You want it to have that music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there you go.</v>

4
00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:20.220
<v Speaker 1>Now that's how we do it for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I appreciate you out.</v>

5
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.400
<v Speaker 1>How about that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because of you will do it from here on </v>

6
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.400
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you know,</v>

7
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:26.640
<v Speaker 1>there's something about it that makes </v>
<v Speaker 1>you feel good.</v>

8
00:00:26.641 --> 00:00:29.460
<v Speaker 1>It gets a little opening or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Little something.</v>

9
00:00:29.461 --> 00:00:34.461
<v Speaker 1>Something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Has there ever been a study on what </v>

10
00:00:34.461 --> 00:00:36.291
<v Speaker 1>exactly music does to the mind?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like an inspirational song when you're </v>

11
00:00:36.291 --> 00:00:36.450
<v Speaker 1>on a treadmill that makes you keep </v>
<v Speaker 1>going?</v>

12
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.630
<v Speaker 1>Oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes all the difference for me.</v>

13
00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:41.360
<v Speaker 1>All the difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

14
00:00:41.361 --> 00:00:43.380
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if they've done that exact </v>
<v Speaker 1>study,</v>

15
00:00:43.381 --> 00:00:48.381
<v Speaker 1>but I'm sure there's been studies that </v>
<v Speaker 1>have been done looking at how music </v>

16
00:00:48.381 --> 00:00:48.381
<v Speaker 1>affects the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

17
00:00:48.381 --> 00:00:50.190
<v Speaker 1>I just don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

18
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.650
<v Speaker 1>there's something going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's 100 percent.</v>

19
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:53.620
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean when,</v>

20
00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:55.560
<v Speaker 1>when a song is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has to be.</v>

21
00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.800
<v Speaker 1>It has to work with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what if it's a song that was </v>

22
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:00.800
<v Speaker 1>your song,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like flash dance,</v>

23
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.240
<v Speaker 1>but that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really liked him and out to the </v>

24
00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.850
<v Speaker 1>stones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really liked the.</v>

25
00:01:05.851 --> 00:01:06.720
<v Speaker 1>Rolling Stones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

26
00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.160
<v Speaker 1>And I also like it when it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

27
00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.180
<v Speaker 1>maybe some ACDC like okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need some motivation to like push past</v>

28
00:01:14.491 --> 00:01:15.800
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

29
00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:18.900
<v Speaker 1>that's what I listened to in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the a cryogenic chamber.</v>

30
00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.290
<v Speaker 1>I listened to back in black because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>just seems like a good song for that </v>

31
00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.060
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This morning I,</v>

32
00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:32.480
<v Speaker 1>after I did a workout I get a cold </v>
<v Speaker 1>shower and I was like singing in the </v>

33
00:01:32.551 --> 00:01:36.600
<v Speaker 1>cold shower because it's so cold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like me singing and I was like,</v>

34
00:01:36.601 --> 00:01:37.060
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

35
00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:38.340
<v Speaker 1>we're hoping to fit in my brand.</v>

36
00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:45.480
<v Speaker 1>And like Dan was like trying to record </v>
<v Speaker 1>video but like audio,</v>

37
00:01:45.511 --> 00:01:49.160
<v Speaker 1>he was like trying to record it for </v>
<v Speaker 1>snapchat but he failed miserably and um,</v>

38
00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.020
<v Speaker 1>but I stayed in for five minutes and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>singing was like,</v>

39
00:01:52.021 --> 00:01:53.760
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it helped me push past that.</v>

40
00:01:53.761 --> 00:01:58.761
<v Speaker 1>This is cold as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you did it just for the </v>

41
00:01:58.761 --> 00:02:00.570
<v Speaker 1>norepinephrine just for the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did I say that right?</v>

42
00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:01.440
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you did.</v>

43
00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:02.310
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did,</v>

44
00:02:02.311 --> 00:02:04.530
<v Speaker 1>I did it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did that.</v>

45
00:02:04.531 --> 00:02:09.531
<v Speaker 1>Plus I try,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tried doing high intensity workout so </v>

46
00:02:09.531 --> 00:02:10.080
<v Speaker 1>I was trying to sprint faster than I </v>
<v Speaker 1>usually do,</v>

47
00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.470
<v Speaker 1>so I like to do a lot of aerobic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do aerobics and I like to mix it up </v>

48
00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:16.440
<v Speaker 1>with some resistance training for </v>
<v Speaker 1>different reasons.</v>

49
00:02:16.441 --> 00:02:19.890
<v Speaker 1>In the same day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I usually do mix it up,</v>

50
00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:21.870
<v Speaker 1>but not always.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It depends.</v>

51
00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.020
<v Speaker 1>It depends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like to like,</v>

52
00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:26.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes I'll start off with Iran and I</v>

53
00:02:26.761 --> 00:02:29.170
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't do like long long runs.</v>

54
00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:34.200
<v Speaker 1>It's like two miles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know enough to like get some brain </v>

55
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.871
<v Speaker 1>drive neurotrophic factor growing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a growth factor that helps you </v>

56
00:02:38.871 --> 00:02:40.690
<v Speaker 1>grow new neurons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's been shown to happen with more of</v>

57
00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.720
<v Speaker 1>aerobic type of exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then the high intensity interval </v>

58
00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.590
<v Speaker 1>training like sprinting or I'll do </v>
<v Speaker 1>bodies,</v>

59
00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.050
<v Speaker 1>body weight squats or push ups or you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

60
00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.890
<v Speaker 1>these backward types of pushups.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then whatever it's going to like,</v>

61
00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.720
<v Speaker 1>get me doing that high intensity sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing where you're,</v>

62
00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.750
<v Speaker 1>you're actually producing lactate </v>
<v Speaker 1>because your body is using glucose since</v>

63
00:03:05.301 --> 00:03:08.350
<v Speaker 1>you can't get oxygen to your muscles </v>
<v Speaker 1>quick enough for how quick you're like,</v>

64
00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:13.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>applying for us and putting this </v>

65
00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.740
<v Speaker 1>energetic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>energetic demand,</v>

66
00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:15.790
<v Speaker 1>use glucose and you don't use it inside </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Mitochondria.</v>

67
00:03:15.791 --> 00:03:17.740
<v Speaker 1>I mean you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't need oxygen,</v>

68
00:03:17.741 --> 00:03:20.740
<v Speaker 1>so you do it without oxygen and you make</v>
<v Speaker 1>lactate is a byproduct.</v>

69
00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.210
<v Speaker 1>Will lactate's been shown to increase </v>
<v Speaker 1>dramatically a lactate uptake into the,</v>

70
00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:30.260
<v Speaker 1>into the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It increases dramatically upon I'm that </v>

71
00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.380
<v Speaker 1>type of exercise and it's lactate that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>fueling norepinephrine released.</v>

72
00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.700
<v Speaker 1>So like you're making more lactate to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make more norepinephrine and your brain.</v>

73
00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:38.770
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and norepinephrine is,</v>

74
00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:44.130
<v Speaker 1>it has an immediate effect of making the</v>
<v Speaker 1>connections between your neurons </v>

75
00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:46.510
<v Speaker 1>stronger so that you remember things </v>
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>

76
00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:51.980
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so that you learn better and you </v>

77
00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:51.980
<v Speaker 1>remember better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's called longterm potentiation.</v>

78
00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:52.720
<v Speaker 1>So I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need my brain to work today.</v>

79
00:03:52.721 --> 00:03:54.550
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to do that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

80
00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:59.790
<v Speaker 1>Whereas the Abramovic type of exercise </v>
<v Speaker 1>has more of a longterm effect because </v>

81
00:04:00.041 --> 00:04:01.970
<v Speaker 1>you're making more neurons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

82
00:04:01.971 --> 00:04:04.180
<v Speaker 1>but those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those neurons take two weeks to mature.</v>

83
00:04:04.181 --> 00:04:09.181
<v Speaker 1>So like the aerobic training that I did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those effects will come two weeks from </v>

84
00:04:09.181 --> 00:04:10.120
<v Speaker 1>now when I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have more neurons,</v>

85
00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:15.450
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the immediate effect of the lactate </v>

86
00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:19.021
<v Speaker 1>and making an effort and it's happening </v>
<v Speaker 1>right now because right now the </v>

87
00:04:19.021 --> 00:04:19.021
<v Speaker 1>connections between my neurons are </v>
<v Speaker 1>stronger.</v>

88
00:04:19.021 --> 00:04:22.240
<v Speaker 1>So and plus it also makes you feel good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

89
00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:23.830
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy though.</v>

90
00:04:23.831 --> 00:04:28.831
<v Speaker 1>There's a physical effect like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a physical effect of your brain </v>

91
00:04:28.831 --> 00:04:31.780
<v Speaker 1>actually functioning better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a direct mechanism involved</v>

92
00:04:31.781 --> 00:04:34.480
<v Speaker 1>in your brain functioning better because</v>
<v Speaker 1>of exercise.</v>

93
00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:37.900
<v Speaker 1>It's so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have been so obsessed with this lately</v>

94
00:04:37.901 --> 00:04:42.901
<v Speaker 1>like this and I know that I have like </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably we've talked about this before </v>

95
00:04:42.901 --> 00:04:45.160
<v Speaker 1>and I talk to people probably get sick </v>
<v Speaker 1>of me talking about it,</v>

96
00:04:45.161 --> 00:04:50.161
<v Speaker 1>but this concept of stressing your body </v>
<v Speaker 1>stressing exercise.</v>

97
00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.340
<v Speaker 1>Most people think exercise is good </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the exercise itself is good.</v>

98
00:04:54.341 --> 00:04:59.341
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the exercise of this exact exercise </v>

99
00:04:59.341 --> 00:05:01.591
<v Speaker 1>itself is not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's actually very stressful on your </v>

100
00:05:01.591 --> 00:05:02.920
<v Speaker 1>body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what's good is the stress response,</v>

101
00:05:02.921 --> 00:05:07.921
<v Speaker 1>the body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've got a hard wired genetic program </v>

102
00:05:08.171 --> 00:05:11.470
<v Speaker 1>that is conserved in plants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>insects,</v>

103
00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:14.350
<v Speaker 1>bacteria,</v>
<v Speaker 1>primates,</v>

104
00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:15.520
<v Speaker 1>humans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

105
00:05:15.521 --> 00:05:17.110
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're all,</v>

106
00:05:17.111 --> 00:05:19.300
<v Speaker 1>we all have this response to stress.</v>

107
00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:22.480
<v Speaker 1>And that response is to try to survive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need,</v>

108
00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:27.880
<v Speaker 1>I need to stay alive past on my genes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously the stress response is much </v>

109
00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:31.771
<v Speaker 1>stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm younger when you're younger or the </v>

110
00:05:31.771 --> 00:05:35.341
<v Speaker 1>earlier in life because your body knows </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not old enough to reproduce for </v>

111
00:05:36.491 --> 00:05:37.000
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

112
00:05:37.001 --> 00:05:38.680
<v Speaker 1>hormones and things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not being produced.</v>

113
00:05:38.681 --> 00:05:42.490
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the stress response,</v>

114
00:05:42.491 --> 00:05:46.120
<v Speaker 1>which is like exercise causes stress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thermal stress,</v>

115
00:05:46.121 --> 00:05:51.121
<v Speaker 1>like heat cold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's all these compounds in </v>

116
00:05:51.121 --> 00:05:52.600
<v Speaker 1>plants that are a stressful to us that </v>
<v Speaker 1>can induce this.</v>

117
00:05:52.601 --> 00:05:57.601
<v Speaker 1>But it's almost like the brain is </v>
<v Speaker 1>preparing for the next time it's going </v>

118
00:05:57.701 --> 00:05:58.760
<v Speaker 1>to encounter stress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

119
00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:59.840
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is war.</v>

120
00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.720
<v Speaker 1>I got to gather up the troops,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I gotta get this army.</v>

121
00:06:02.721 --> 00:06:05.390
<v Speaker 1>We got to assemble this army because </v>
<v Speaker 1>that stress is going to happen again.</v>

122
00:06:05.391 --> 00:06:08.630
<v Speaker 1>I got to pray for war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it kind of makes sense that you're,</v>

123
00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:14.120
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have a very profound and</v>
<v Speaker 1>positive effect in your brain and also </v>

124
00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:14.150
<v Speaker 1>in other parts of the body.</v>

125
00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:15.530
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

126
00:06:15.531 --> 00:06:17.460
<v Speaker 1>the exercise itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

127
00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:23.200
<v Speaker 1>it's funny because a lot of people do it</v>
<v Speaker 1>to lose weight or to mostly to lose </v>

128
00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:26.720
<v Speaker 1>weight or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>become sexually attractive muscle mass,</v>

129
00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:29.750
<v Speaker 1>which has other very important </v>
<v Speaker 1>physiological effects,</v>

130
00:06:29.751 --> 00:06:32.090
<v Speaker 1>but people do it because they want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>look good.</v>

131
00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:34.310
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and honestly,</v>

132
00:06:34.311 --> 00:06:36.050
<v Speaker 1>a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are a lot of people that say,</v>

133
00:06:36.051 --> 00:06:41.051
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exercise doesn't really play an </v>

134
00:06:41.051 --> 00:06:41.051
<v Speaker 1>important role in losing weight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's nutrition.</v>

135
00:06:41.051 --> 00:06:44.621
<v Speaker 1>You know what the right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but exercise has a very important role </v>

136
00:06:44.621 --> 00:06:47.681
<v Speaker 1>and that role is to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to cause your body stress so that you </v>

137
00:06:47.681 --> 00:06:52.631
<v Speaker 1>activate all these really good and </v>
<v Speaker 1>awesome jeans that are helping you deal </v>

138
00:06:52.631 --> 00:06:53.240
<v Speaker 1>with stress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And guess what?</v>

139
00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:56.690
<v Speaker 1>Stress is happening right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every time you breathe in oxygen,</v>

140
00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:58.880
<v Speaker 1>your making stress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

141
00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:02.420
<v Speaker 1>you're generating byproducts that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>very dangerous.</v>

142
00:07:02.421 --> 00:07:04.310
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so exercise is good</v>

143
00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:09.990
<v Speaker 2>with definitely good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just get freaked out when people that </v>

144
00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:09.990
<v Speaker 2>are really smart don't get into </v>
<v Speaker 2>exercise.</v>

145
00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:12.490
<v Speaker 2>And I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always feel like that's just,</v>

146
00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:13.930
<v Speaker 2>they have a blind spot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

147
00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.000
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a blind spot where they don't </v>

148
00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:19.000
<v Speaker 2>want to discipline themselves to </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually do the work.</v>

149
00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.130
<v Speaker 2>They just find that troublesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or maybe they connected with jocks or </v>

150
00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:24.100
<v Speaker 2>people that were assholes when they were</v>
<v Speaker 2>in school.</v>

151
00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:24.740
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

152
00:07:24.741 --> 00:07:26.230
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes there's that connection</v>

153
00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:26.880
<v Speaker 1>option.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

154
00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:31.540
<v Speaker 1>They probably don't realize the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the anti anxiety effects they have.</v>

155
00:07:31.541 --> 00:07:34.200
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the Anti.</v>

156
00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:39.300
<v Speaker 1>I really also do it because I've got </v>
<v Speaker 1>some kind of like hyperactive stress </v>

157
00:07:41.321 --> 00:07:42.520
<v Speaker 1>response,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stress,</v>

158
00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:44.290
<v Speaker 1>hyper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hypothalamus,</v>

159
00:07:44.291 --> 00:07:46.380
<v Speaker 1>pituitary axis where you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

160
00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:48.260
<v Speaker 1>I'm prone to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

161
00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:49.840
<v Speaker 1>there's a tiger does lie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

162
00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:51.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's always kind of like,</v>

163
00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:52.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm ready.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm ready to fight.</v>

164
00:07:52.361 --> 00:07:53.680
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something's coming to get me.</v>

165
00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:55.990
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes when I'm really stressed I'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>get night terrors.</v>

166
00:07:55.991 --> 00:07:59.500
<v Speaker 1>So like I'll wake up screaming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It scared the crap out of Dan.</v>

167
00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:04.980
<v Speaker 1>Jesus really not used to be a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when I was in graduate school and I</v>

168
00:08:05.021 --> 00:08:06.640
<v Speaker 1>was really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really stressed.</v>

169
00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:11.820
<v Speaker 1>I would wake up and I just scream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought there was like someone coming </v>

170
00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:15.430
<v Speaker 1>to get me and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was times where I actually injured</v>

171
00:08:15.431 --> 00:08:19.720
<v Speaker 1>myself too because I flew across the </v>
<v Speaker 1>room because.</v>

172
00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:23.290
<v Speaker 1>Because I thought that there was someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>coming to get me so,</v>

173
00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:26.080
<v Speaker 1>so that more than once.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

174
00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:29.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hurt my wrist hurt like my,</v>

175
00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:33.550
<v Speaker 1>like some tendon back here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I broke them near Jesus.</v>

176
00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:35.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like once a month.</v>

177
00:08:35.261 --> 00:08:36.880
<v Speaker 1>Once a week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well now a days.</v>

178
00:08:36.881 --> 00:08:41.881
<v Speaker 1>It's like almost nonexistent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say it happens once every,</v>

179
00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:48.550
<v Speaker 1>maybe four months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there was a time not too long ago,</v>

180
00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:52.780
<v Speaker 1>like three years ago where I was doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>it at least a couple times a week.</v>

181
00:08:52.810 --> 00:08:54.190
<v Speaker 1>Once,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once a week for sure.</v>

182
00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:56.370
<v Speaker 1>That's so weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've</v>

183
00:08:56.370 --> 00:08:59.280
<v Speaker 2>always associated people that are like </v>
<v Speaker 2>really paranoid about fear,</v>

184
00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:01.860
<v Speaker 2>about danger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether with intelligence,</v>

185
00:09:01.861 --> 00:09:05.130
<v Speaker 2>because it's like if you actually pay </v>
<v Speaker 2>attention to the world around you,</v>

186
00:09:05.131 --> 00:09:08.790
<v Speaker 2>you realize how vulnerable you are and </v>
<v Speaker 2>how many random things can happen.</v>

187
00:09:08.791 --> 00:09:11.370
<v Speaker 2>Random accidents,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bizarre occurrences,</v>

188
00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:15.210
<v Speaker 2>run into the wrong people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The wrong place at the wrong time,</v>

189
00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:17.910
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we're so easily damaged.</v>

190
00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:20.880
<v Speaker 2>Take that as a compliment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

191
00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:25.140
<v Speaker 2>I think there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

192
00:09:25.141 --> 00:09:30.141
<v Speaker 2>there's definitely something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of an ocd loop sometimes </v>

193
00:09:30.141 --> 00:09:32.850
<v Speaker 2>tonight and I'll get that where it just </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's so bad like you just get going.</v>

194
00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:35.400
<v Speaker 2>I think I haven't even talked about on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the podcast before,</v>

195
00:09:35.401 --> 00:09:39.120
<v Speaker 2>like there was a time when I was scared </v>
<v Speaker 2>to drive like,</v>

196
00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:44.160
<v Speaker 2>and even now I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I drive but I feel most comfortable </v>

197
00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:44.160
<v Speaker 2>driving in a place that I'm very </v>
<v Speaker 2>familiar with.</v>

198
00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:46.470
<v Speaker 2>But if I start to let my brain think </v>
<v Speaker 2>about it,</v>

199
00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:48.240
<v Speaker 2>it's like driving scary.</v>

200
00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:49.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well it should be.</v>

201
00:09:49.930 --> 00:09:54.930
<v Speaker 2>You look around and all these people </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are texting to so few people are </v>

202
00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:55.890
<v Speaker 2>giving 100 percent of their attention to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the road these days.</v>

203
00:09:56.370 --> 00:09:58.620
<v Speaker 2>There's so much going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Self driving cars.</v>

204
00:09:58.650 --> 00:10:00.990
<v Speaker 2>I'm actually looking forward to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they have them now.</v>

205
00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:03.450
<v Speaker 2>Well they're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not ubiquitous or not.</v>

206
00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:04.520
<v Speaker 2>They're not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

207
00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:08.570
<v Speaker 2>people aren't using them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well my friend has one and no,</v>

208
00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:13.630
<v Speaker 2>he drives with the new Tesla.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You press two buttons on it and it </v>

209
00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:15.210
<v Speaker 2>literally drives on the highway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It turns.</v>

210
00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:17.010
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

211
00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:19.050
<v Speaker 2>He sits back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't even put his fucking hands on</v>

212
00:10:19.051 --> 00:10:19.950
<v Speaker 2>the wheel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

213
00:10:19.951 --> 00:10:21.720
<v Speaker 2>it's the craziest shit you've ever seen </v>
<v Speaker 2>in your life.</v>

214
00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:22.230
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tom,</v>

215
00:10:22.231 --> 00:10:22.950
<v Speaker 2>Papa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tom,</v>

216
00:10:22.951 --> 00:10:26.550
<v Speaker 2>papa has to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was were the new teslas.</v>

217
00:10:26.551 --> 00:10:31.551
<v Speaker 2>We're only allowing to let you park.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't realize you could actually </v>

218
00:10:31.551 --> 00:10:31.551
<v Speaker 2>drive on the highway.</v>

219
00:10:31.551 --> 00:10:34.440
<v Speaker 2>The newest versions of them drive on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>highway.</v>

220
00:10:34.441 --> 00:10:37.150
<v Speaker 2>I have two friends that have them and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you pray.</v>

221
00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:39.300
<v Speaker 2>I guess there's a button,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that navigation button.</v>

222
00:10:39.301 --> 00:10:44.301
<v Speaker 2>You Punch in the information and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>you press it twice and this sucker will </v>

223
00:10:44.301 --> 00:10:46.590
<v Speaker 2>drive you to where you need to go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's pretty cool.</v>

224
00:10:46.890 --> 00:10:48.780
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't work on Shitty old roads </v>
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>

225
00:10:48.930 --> 00:10:50.910
<v Speaker 2>Like Tom Papa was talking about Laurel </v>
<v Speaker 2>Canyon.</v>

226
00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:56.060
<v Speaker 2>Laurel Canyon has got kind of like it </v>
<v Speaker 2>goes by computer sensors that are </v>

227
00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:58.770
<v Speaker 2>detecting the lines based on the cameras</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the car has.</v>

228
00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:04.160
<v Speaker 2>So the car has these external cameras,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they see the lines and then they adjust </v>

229
00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:06.120
<v Speaker 2>accordingly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when the lines are really wonky,</v>

230
00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:08.310
<v Speaker 2>like if you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to over Laurel Canyon,</v>

231
00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:10.740
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really shitty.</v>

232
00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:16.140
<v Speaker 2>Le Rose kind of bumpy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of potholes and the lines are </v>

233
00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:16.140
<v Speaker 2>really blurry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're worn out.</v>

234
00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:16.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So on that.</v>

235
00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:19.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure you have,</v>

236
00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:22.200
<v Speaker 2>but on a really good road it works </v>
<v Speaker 2>great.</v>

237
00:11:22.890 --> 00:11:24.670
<v Speaker 2>Like it just drives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

238
00:11:24.690 --> 00:11:25.860
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

239
00:11:27.250 --> 00:11:29.280
<v Speaker 2>I mean sign me up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

240
00:11:29.281 --> 00:11:34.281
<v Speaker 2>I mean I want everyone else to be in </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I'm actually afraid of everyone </v>

241
00:11:34.281 --> 00:11:36.030
<v Speaker 2>else that's even like coming into La.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we drive into La.</v>

242
00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:40.230
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People here are crazy drivers.</v>

243
00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:44.910
<v Speaker 2>People swerving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean just constantly swerving.</v>

244
00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:49.970
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if people are just really </v>
<v Speaker 2>aggressive because there's so many </v>

245
00:11:49.970 --> 00:11:49.970
<v Speaker 2>people and you have to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

246
00:11:49.970 --> 00:11:51.960
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly noticed it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a study,</v>

247
00:11:52.590 --> 00:11:57.590
<v Speaker 2>there's an episode of radio lab about </v>
<v Speaker 2>this or they did a study on volume of </v>

248
00:11:57.590 --> 00:12:02.580
<v Speaker 2>people in cities and what affect the </v>
<v Speaker 2>volume of people has on a how many </v>

249
00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:07.350
<v Speaker 2>syllables per minute they say and how </v>
<v Speaker 2>many steps per minute they take and </v>

250
00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:11.561
<v Speaker 2>there's a direct correlation worldwide </v>
<v Speaker 2>between higher populations and like you </v>

251
00:12:11.561 --> 00:12:16.501
<v Speaker 2>can literally guess if you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you set up a camera on a street and </v>

252
00:12:16.501 --> 00:12:20.881
<v Speaker 2>you record all the people walking by and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get a good number of people when you</v>

253
00:12:21.221 --> 00:12:26.221
<v Speaker 2>calculate how fast are walking and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>you record them talking just from those </v>

254
00:12:26.221 --> 00:12:30.811
<v Speaker 2>two pieces of data.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can tell how many people are in the </v>

255
00:12:30.811 --> 00:12:30.811
<v Speaker 2>city like</v>

256
00:12:30.811 --> 00:12:31.190
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but let's see if I can guess so.</v>

257
00:12:31.191 --> 00:12:34.070
<v Speaker 1>If there's more people in the city,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you walk faster and talk less?</v>

258
00:12:34.270 --> 00:12:35.210
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You Walk Faster,</v>

259
00:12:35.211 --> 00:12:37.400
<v Speaker 1>you talk faster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk faster,</v>

260
00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:39.020
<v Speaker 1>talk faster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you walk faster.</v>

261
00:12:39.470 --> 00:12:44.470
<v Speaker 1>Both of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if there's a direct correlation </v>

262
00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:44.570
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at the speed of how you talk,</v>

263
00:12:44.571 --> 00:12:46.580
<v Speaker 1>not how frequent you talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly,</v>

264
00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:50.300
<v Speaker 1>exactly how fast you talk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how quickly walk,</v>

265
00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:52.430
<v Speaker 1>because I feel like the faster you walk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more you're like,</v>

266
00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:53.060
<v Speaker 1>got to go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>

267
00:12:53.061 --> 00:12:53.450
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>

268
00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:55.190
<v Speaker 1>go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The less likely you're going to stop and</v>

269
00:12:55.191 --> 00:12:56.780
<v Speaker 1>talk to someone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what I mean?</v>

270
00:12:56.781 --> 00:12:57.890
<v Speaker 1>So it's kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just like,</v>

271
00:12:57.950 --> 00:12:58.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>

272
00:12:58.551 --> 00:12:59.670
<v Speaker 1>I got to go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

273
00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:02.780
<v Speaker 1>we're going to do to go get a fucking go</v>
<v Speaker 1>downtown and there's a lot of shit going</v>

274
00:13:02.781 --> 00:13:03.260
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See it,</v>

275
00:13:03.270 --> 00:13:06.500
<v Speaker 1>buy this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas if you go to the middle of rural</v>

276
00:13:06.501 --> 00:13:07.160
<v Speaker 1>Tennessee will.</v>

277
00:13:07.170 --> 00:13:09.230
<v Speaker 1>Hello,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's your name?</v>

278
00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:10.670
<v Speaker 1>Dr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rhonda will.</v>

279
00:13:10.671 --> 00:13:12.830
<v Speaker 1>Very nice to meet you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dr Rhonda,</v>

280
00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:18.130
<v Speaker 1>what kind of Doctor Are you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess that could be why there's sort </v>

281
00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:20.330
<v Speaker 1>of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a stereotype that people in the south or</v>

282
00:13:20.331 --> 00:13:22.070
<v Speaker 1>a little friendlier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they just,</v>

283
00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:25.700
<v Speaker 1>maybe that's why there's less people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have more time,</v>

284
00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:31.100
<v Speaker 1>more time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know I get in this loop or it's like </v>

285
00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:31.520
<v Speaker 1>I'm so busy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you're super busy where it's just</v>

286
00:13:31.521 --> 00:13:31.910
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

287
00:13:31.911 --> 00:13:32.870
<v Speaker 1>I don't have time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I gotta go,</v>

288
00:13:32.871 --> 00:13:33.890
<v Speaker 1>I got this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got.</v>

289
00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:35.920
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to get out of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

290
00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:38.390
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a good balance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need a balance,</v>

291
00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:40.580
<v Speaker 1>you know there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need that drive,</v>

292
00:13:40.581 --> 00:13:42.080
<v Speaker 1>that motivation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's good to like,</v>

293
00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:47.260
<v Speaker 1>you're obviously doing something </v>
<v Speaker 1>productive that's contributing to </v>

294
00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:47.260
<v Speaker 1>society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

295
00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:51.920
<v Speaker 1>you're fulfilling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you feel like you're fulfilling </v>

296
00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:52.670
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But also then did life just goes.</v>

297
00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:54.560
<v Speaker 1>It's like it goes quick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quick.</v>

298
00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:57.030
<v Speaker 1>It goes quick and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm almost 50,</v>

299
00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:02.200
<v Speaker 2>48,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll be 49 in August and then like this </v>

300
00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:04.310
<v Speaker 2>is my body works great now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but for how long,</v>

301
00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:06.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody's body works great at 70,</v>

302
00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:09.530
<v Speaker 2>it just doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're all shitty.</v>

303
00:14:09.950 --> 00:14:14.950
<v Speaker 2>They're all show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's holding their back and </v>

304
00:14:14.950 --> 00:14:15.440
<v Speaker 2>they're fucking knees hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you hit 80,</v>

305
00:14:15.530 --> 00:14:18.790
<v Speaker 2>who's an athlete at 80?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who's doing cartwheels at 80 and,</v>

306
00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:21.230
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and doing chin ups in a row,</v>

307
00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:22.280
<v Speaker 2>it's just not happening.</v>

308
00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:27.060
<v Speaker 1>I used to surf with a guy back when I </v>
<v Speaker 1>was in college.</v>

309
00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:28.490
<v Speaker 1>Who was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was a surgeon,</v>

310
00:14:28.491 --> 00:14:32.820
<v Speaker 1>who's Dr we called him doc and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was pushing 90,</v>

311
00:14:32.821 --> 00:14:34.200
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like 88,</v>

312
00:14:34.201 --> 00:14:35.350
<v Speaker 1>89 or he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

313
00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:37.140
<v Speaker 1>we rounded up and is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's 90,</v>

314
00:14:37.141 --> 00:14:39.420
<v Speaker 1>but he was out there surfing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>catching waves.</v>

315
00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:42.600
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm sure it wasn't like competing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

316
00:14:42.810 --> 00:14:47.810
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do think that the more physically fit </v>

317
00:14:47.810 --> 00:14:49.710
<v Speaker 1>you are and the more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

318
00:14:49.711 --> 00:14:51.890
<v Speaker 1>throughout your life and the better you </v>
<v Speaker 1>eat,</v>

319
00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:53.630
<v Speaker 1>these things are all going to affect the</v>
<v Speaker 1>way you age.</v>

320
00:14:53.631 --> 00:14:54.990
<v Speaker 1>They're all going to affect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

321
00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:56.930
<v Speaker 1>how much pain you're in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

322
00:14:56.960 --> 00:15:01.960
<v Speaker 1>all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And obviously losing muscle mass as big </v>

323
00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:04.250
<v Speaker 1>thing starting in mid middle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>starting at 40 humans start to lose like</v>

324
00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:06.810
<v Speaker 1>point five to one percent or something </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

325
00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:08.580
<v Speaker 1>Muscle mass per year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

326
00:15:08.581 --> 00:15:11.060
<v Speaker 1>just without,</v>
<v Speaker 1>without doing anything.</v>

327
00:15:11.090 --> 00:15:12.470
<v Speaker 1>That makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

328
00:15:12.471 --> 00:15:17.030
<v Speaker 1>I think that that's probably one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>more difficult things to gain as you get</v>

329
00:15:17.031 --> 00:15:19.310
<v Speaker 1>older.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you can maintain it,</v>

330
00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:24.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're way better off because if you </v>

331
00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:26.231
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're out of shape your whole life </v>

332
00:15:26.231 --> 00:15:26.231
<v Speaker 1>and then also in your pushing 60 and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

333
00:15:26.231 --> 00:15:26.870
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to get to the gym.</v>

334
00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:30.380
<v Speaker 1>Well it's so hard to make gains.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so hard to do,</v>

335
00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:35.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any sort of like real resistance </v>

336
00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:35.990
<v Speaker 1>training on a regular basis and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be so sore,</v>

337
00:15:36.190 --> 00:15:37.760
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be so hard to build a </v>
<v Speaker 1>base.</v>

338
00:15:37.930 --> 00:15:41.120
<v Speaker 1>So it's a much more difficult route.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's difficult now.</v>

339
00:15:41.121 --> 00:15:44.330
<v Speaker 1>And you know that resistance training,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's something,</v>

340
00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:47.510
<v Speaker 1>I don't know a lot about this but it's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>topic that I'm interested in,</v>

341
00:15:47.570 --> 00:15:52.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I'm convinced that maintaining </v>

342
00:15:52.570 --> 00:15:53.360
<v Speaker 1>muscle mass is very important as you </v>
<v Speaker 1>age.</v>

343
00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:58.360
<v Speaker 1>And specifically I think that the type,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the type two type of muscle fibers that </v>

344
00:15:58.790 --> 00:16:03.790
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you do get when you're doing more </v>

345
00:16:03.790 --> 00:16:03.790
<v Speaker 1>resistance training,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are the kind of fast twitch.</v>

346
00:16:03.790 --> 00:16:06.140
<v Speaker 1>I think those actually play a role in </v>
<v Speaker 1>like stability,</v>

347
00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:11.500
<v Speaker 1>being able to like quickly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like lose your balance or which is </v>

348
00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:15.701
<v Speaker 1>important as you start to get older and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you become more frail and falling down </v>

349
00:16:15.701 --> 00:16:16.790
<v Speaker 1>and breaking your hip can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That can take you out.</v>

350
00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:21.820
<v Speaker 1>Like that's a big problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's another thing that bone density </v>

351
00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:22.760
<v Speaker 1>gets increased by muscle resistance </v>
<v Speaker 1>training,</v>

352
00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:24.450
<v Speaker 1>weight training,</v>
<v Speaker 1>squats,</v>

353
00:16:24.451 --> 00:16:25.880
<v Speaker 1>dead lifts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things along those lines.</v>

354
00:16:26.180 --> 00:16:28.520
<v Speaker 1>That has a pretty profound effect on </v>
<v Speaker 1>bone density.</v>

355
00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:34.060
<v Speaker 1>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a hormone that's actually </v>

356
00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:36.221
<v Speaker 1>released,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think from muscle tissue called Iris </v>

357
00:16:36.221 --> 00:16:38.930
<v Speaker 1>and that is released when you're doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>resistance training and uh,</v>

358
00:16:39.530 --> 00:16:41.300
<v Speaker 1>possibly also during a robot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure,</v>

359
00:16:41.301 --> 00:16:41.900
<v Speaker 1>but it does.</v>

360
00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:44.880
<v Speaker 1>It plays a role in helping maintain </v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

361
00:16:44.950 --> 00:16:47.120
<v Speaker 1>your bone density as well as </v>
<v Speaker 1>osteocalcin.</v>

362
00:16:47.121 --> 00:16:52.121
<v Speaker 1>Osteocalcin released osteocalcin then </v>
<v Speaker 1>gets into your bloodstream at pulls </v>

363
00:16:52.121 --> 00:16:53.930
<v Speaker 1>calcium out of your bloodstream and </v>
<v Speaker 1>brings it back to the bone.</v>

364
00:16:53.931 --> 00:16:54.880
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

365
00:16:54.890 --> 00:16:59.890
<v Speaker 1>the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that most of the calcium that we </v>

366
00:16:59.890 --> 00:17:01.700
<v Speaker 1>store in our body is in our bone or </v>
<v Speaker 1>teeth and bones and muscle,</v>

367
00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:05.630
<v Speaker 1>but I'm calcium plays a very important </v>
<v Speaker 1>role in the bloodstream as well.</v>

368
00:17:05.631 --> 00:17:09.170
<v Speaker 1>So anytime we're not getting enough </v>
<v Speaker 1>calcium,</v>

369
00:17:09.171 --> 00:17:14.171
<v Speaker 1>and I think something like 38 percent of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the US population doesn't get enough </v>

370
00:17:14.171 --> 00:17:17.291
<v Speaker 1>calcium like so there's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a huge percentage of the </v>

371
00:17:17.291 --> 00:17:19.370
<v Speaker 1>population doesn't get enough calcium </v>
<v Speaker 1>and whenever you don't get enough,</v>

372
00:17:19.371 --> 00:17:24.371
<v Speaker 1>your body actually pulls it out of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bone and brings it to bloodstream so </v>

373
00:17:24.371 --> 00:17:28.241
<v Speaker 1>that it can play an important role in </v>
<v Speaker 1>endothelial cells and making sure they </v>

374
00:17:28.241 --> 00:17:28.241
<v Speaker 1>don't get to step.</v>

375
00:17:28.241 --> 00:17:30.710
<v Speaker 1>And so that's where osteoporosis come </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying yeah,</v>

376
00:17:30.711 --> 00:17:35.711
<v Speaker 1>because as you age,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you imagine a lifetime of chronic </v>

377
00:17:35.711 --> 00:17:37.100
<v Speaker 1>calcium,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quote unquote inadequacy,</v>

378
00:17:37.101 --> 00:17:38.480
<v Speaker 1>so you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're never,</v>

379
00:17:38.570 --> 00:17:42.410
<v Speaker 1>you're never getting enough of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>calcium every day.</v>

380
00:17:42.470 --> 00:17:47.470
<v Speaker 1>Eventually that's going to start to </v>
<v Speaker 1>build up and you're gonna keep pulling </v>

381
00:17:47.470 --> 00:17:47.470
<v Speaker 1>it out of your bone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're gonna.</v>

382
00:17:47.470 --> 00:17:47.470
<v Speaker 1>Keep pulling it out of bone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know there's a,</v>

383
00:17:47.471 --> 00:17:49.170
<v Speaker 1>there's a couple of things that regulate</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

384
00:17:49.171 --> 00:17:54.171
<v Speaker 1>That's one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just obviously just not getting enough </v>

385
00:17:54.171 --> 00:17:57.021
<v Speaker 1>calcium so you keep pulling it out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>your bone and the other thing is not </v>

386
00:17:57.021 --> 00:17:59.781
<v Speaker 1>getting enough of the so doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing the types of exercises that you </v>

387
00:17:59.851 --> 00:18:03.660
<v Speaker 1>need to do to make sure you're releasing</v>
<v Speaker 1>these hormones that are bringing calcium</v>

388
00:18:03.661 --> 00:18:05.190
<v Speaker 1>to the bone that are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

389
00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:06.100
<v Speaker 1>doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

390
00:18:06.540 --> 00:18:08.790
<v Speaker 1>and also certain dietary factors can </v>
<v Speaker 1>play a role in that.</v>

391
00:18:08.850 --> 00:18:12.060
<v Speaker 1>So making sure that you're getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough vitaminK ,</v>

392
00:18:12.770 --> 00:18:13.320
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>vitaminK ,</v>

393
00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:15.090
<v Speaker 1>one is found in green plants.</v>

394
00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:20.120
<v Speaker 1>It plays a role in blood coagulation </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you have enough of it for that </v>

395
00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:24.171
<v Speaker 1>blood coagulation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then some vitaminK stays around the </v>

396
00:18:24.171 --> 00:18:26.901
<v Speaker 1>bloodstream and activates osteocalcin </v>
<v Speaker 1>and other genes that are able to pull </v>

397
00:18:26.901 --> 00:18:31.191
<v Speaker 1>the calcium to the bone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Vitamin K two never really goes to the </v>

398
00:18:31.191 --> 00:18:34.500
<v Speaker 1>liver and that's um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that's found in fermented sort</v>

399
00:18:34.501 --> 00:18:39.501
<v Speaker 1>of a bacteria make it so like you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>find vitamin K two in the western diet,</v>

400
00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:42.060
<v Speaker 1>like cheeses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bleu cheese is fermented.</v>

401
00:18:42.061 --> 00:18:46.050
<v Speaker 1>Cheeses have a higher amount.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some in organ meats like liver,</v>

402
00:18:46.830 --> 00:18:50.550
<v Speaker 1>but Natto fermented soybeans are the </v>
<v Speaker 1>highest fermented soybeans,</v>

403
00:18:50.570 --> 00:18:52.160
<v Speaker 1>not toe to toe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

404
00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:57.300
<v Speaker 1>they've got like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're comparing like cheese or even </v>

405
00:18:57.300 --> 00:18:58.950
<v Speaker 1>organ meat to Natto,</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at k two levels,</v>

406
00:18:58.951 --> 00:19:02.010
<v Speaker 1>there's no comparison.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not toes got a huge amount.</v>

407
00:19:02.130 --> 00:19:05.870
<v Speaker 1>I've never even heard of that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty big in the health community.</v>

408
00:19:05.870 --> 00:19:10.870
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's also high in something else called </v>

409
00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:10.870
<v Speaker 1>Spermatozoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

410
00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:15.350
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is able to clear away damaged cells in </v>

411
00:19:15.781 --> 00:19:20.781
<v Speaker 1>your body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's called drip process called a </v>

412
00:19:20.781 --> 00:19:23.331
<v Speaker 1>topic Ge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're always getting damaged cells </v>

413
00:19:23.331 --> 00:19:23.670
<v Speaker 1>and anytime we have a salt that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>damaged,</v>

414
00:19:24.090 --> 00:19:25.860
<v Speaker 1>damaged cells occur,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

415
00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:28.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just just from normal metabolism.</v>

416
00:19:28.321 --> 00:19:30.760
<v Speaker 1>But as our telomeres get shorter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

417
00:19:31.530 --> 00:19:36.530
<v Speaker 1>the team always take the hit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So tila mirrors are those tiny caps on </v>

418
00:19:36.530 --> 00:19:39.321
<v Speaker 1>the end of your chromosomes and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>always are like sacrificing themselves </v>

419
00:19:39.321 --> 00:19:42.291
<v Speaker 1>because they don't want your dna to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>the damage because if your dna gets </v>

420
00:19:42.291 --> 00:19:42.390
<v Speaker 1>damaged,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it could lead to cancer.</v>

421
00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:45.810
<v Speaker 1>So they take the hit and as they start </v>
<v Speaker 1>to get shorter,</v>

422
00:19:45.811 --> 00:19:48.810
<v Speaker 1>it accelerates their shortening because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they already get shorter each year.</v>

423
00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:52.350
<v Speaker 1>Then what happens is the cell becomes </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's called senescent.</v>

424
00:19:52.950 --> 00:19:57.950
<v Speaker 1>And what that means is the cell just </v>
<v Speaker 1>sits around in your bloodstream or in </v>

425
00:19:57.950 --> 00:19:58.410
<v Speaker 1>your kidney or your liver or whatever </v>
<v Speaker 1>organ we're talking about,</v>

426
00:19:58.411 --> 00:19:59.910
<v Speaker 1>and it's not really alive.</v>

427
00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:02.850
<v Speaker 1>So it's not mel metabolic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't like go away.</v>

428
00:20:02.851 --> 00:20:07.851
<v Speaker 1>It's not dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what does it just sits there and it </v>

429
00:20:07.851 --> 00:20:09.150
<v Speaker 1>starts to secrete I'm pro inflammatory </v>
<v Speaker 1>cytokines,</v>

430
00:20:09.151 --> 00:20:14.151
<v Speaker 1>which then activate nearby immune cells </v>
<v Speaker 1>to like fire away nasty chemicals in </v>

431
00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:15.020
<v Speaker 1>damage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more cells.</v>

432
00:20:15.021 --> 00:20:17.400
<v Speaker 1>So what happens is you start to damage </v>
<v Speaker 1>nearby cells.</v>

433
00:20:18.050 --> 00:20:23.050
<v Speaker 1>You can think about like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have you ever noticed like when you get </v>

434
00:20:23.050 --> 00:20:23.050
<v Speaker 1>a gray hair,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so gray hair,</v>

435
00:20:23.050 --> 00:20:27.500
<v Speaker 1>you'll get senescent Malana sites,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are the cells that produce the </v>

436
00:20:27.661 --> 00:20:30.020
<v Speaker 1>pigment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll get one that senescence.</v>

437
00:20:30.030 --> 00:20:35.030
<v Speaker 1>So it's just kind of sitting there and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it causes a hair follicle and her hair </v>

438
00:20:35.910 --> 00:20:38.670
<v Speaker 1>gray.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then all the other hairstyles around</v>

439
00:20:38.671 --> 00:20:41.010
<v Speaker 1>nearby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You always get them near each other.</v>

440
00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:46.760
<v Speaker 1>And part of that has to do with the fact</v>
<v Speaker 1>that these senescent mental Melana site </v>

441
00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:46.760
<v Speaker 1>in this case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

442
00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:47.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the hair follicle,</v>

443
00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:50.530
<v Speaker 1>is to creating all this nasty stuff that</v>
<v Speaker 1>then damages other nearby,</v>

444
00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:52.440
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hair soft.</v>

445
00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:54.010
<v Speaker 1>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's fascinating.</v>

446
00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:54.550
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

447
00:20:54.551 --> 00:20:55.810
<v Speaker 1>so anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>back to the spermatids,</v>

448
00:20:55.930 --> 00:21:00.930
<v Speaker 1>the spermatids actually clears away it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it activates this whole genetic system </v>

449
00:21:01.001 --> 00:21:03.940
<v Speaker 1>we have in our body called autophagy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is like self eating.</v>

450
00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:07.330
<v Speaker 1>So we start to like eat this cell and </v>
<v Speaker 1>cleared away.</v>

451
00:21:07.570 --> 00:21:12.570
<v Speaker 1>And recently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like within the last month a study came </v>

452
00:21:12.570 --> 00:21:14.650
<v Speaker 1>out where scientists actually engineered</v>
<v Speaker 1>mice,</v>

453
00:21:14.970 --> 00:21:19.970
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>using crispr technology to clear away </v>

454
00:21:19.970 --> 00:21:19.970
<v Speaker 1>all the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every time they had a senescent cell.</v>

455
00:21:19.970 --> 00:21:21.700
<v Speaker 1>You and I are getting senescent cells </v>
<v Speaker 1>right now,</v>

456
00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:23.620
<v Speaker 1>but right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry Jamie,</v>

457
00:21:23.621 --> 00:21:25.930
<v Speaker 1>it's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's happening all the time.</v>

458
00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:27.340
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

459
00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:31.120
<v Speaker 1>but the researchers did this brilliant </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiment where they designed,</v>

460
00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:32.110
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were like,</v>

461
00:21:32.111 --> 00:21:33.610
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an essence cell,</v>

462
00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:35.980
<v Speaker 1>has a certain marker on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they then said,</v>

463
00:21:35.981 --> 00:21:37.420
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when this marker gets expressed,</v>

464
00:21:37.810 --> 00:21:40.090
<v Speaker 1>I want you to have the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have the,</v>

465
00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:42.280
<v Speaker 1>these immune cells go and cleared away </v>
<v Speaker 1>and eat it.</v>

466
00:21:42.910 --> 00:21:45.190
<v Speaker 1>And so every time there's a senescent </v>
<v Speaker 1>cell,</v>

467
00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:50.700
<v Speaker 1>the immune system cleared it out and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>mice ended up living 30 percent longer </v>

468
00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:53.710
<v Speaker 1>than their normal lifespan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pretty cool topic.</v>

469
00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:54.760
<v Speaker 1>It's called.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty cool.</v>

470
00:21:54.761 --> 00:21:58.870
<v Speaker 1>And there are other things that actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>increase it resveratrol.</v>

471
00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:01.750
<v Speaker 1>Brisbane was very trial from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

472
00:22:02.170 --> 00:22:06.710
<v Speaker 1>it's a one of those plant compounds </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the spin,</v>

473
00:22:06.711 --> 00:22:11.711
<v Speaker 1>a recent obsession of mine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But plants make like natural </v>

474
00:22:11.711 --> 00:22:15.550
<v Speaker 1>insecticides and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for millions of years,</v>

475
00:22:15.551 --> 00:22:20.530
<v Speaker 1>plants have been figuring out a way to </v>
<v Speaker 1>like ward off insects and fungus and you</v>

476
00:22:20.531 --> 00:22:25.531
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they also want to stay alive </v>

477
00:22:25.531 --> 00:22:27.750
<v Speaker 1>just like we do and they don't actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>make enough of this camp like these </v>

478
00:22:28.541 --> 00:22:31.150
<v Speaker 1>chemicals to kill the insect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's Kinda like just go away.</v>

479
00:22:31.180 --> 00:22:33.070
<v Speaker 1>So they often affect their nervous </v>
<v Speaker 1>system,</v>

480
00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:35.290
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and just kind of make them go away.</v>

481
00:22:35.291 --> 00:22:40.291
<v Speaker 1>But what's really cool is that these </v>
<v Speaker 1>compounds in plants and there's so many </v>

482
00:22:40.361 --> 00:22:43.870
<v Speaker 1>different ones actually have a hormetic </v>
<v Speaker 1>effect on us.</v>

483
00:22:43.870 --> 00:22:46.450
<v Speaker 1>So that hormetic effect being in small </v>
<v Speaker 1>doses,</v>

484
00:22:46.750 --> 00:22:48.940
<v Speaker 1>it activates our whole stress response </v>
<v Speaker 1>pathway,</v>

485
00:22:48.941 --> 00:22:53.941
<v Speaker 1>like exercise does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I'm raspberry trolley is actually</v>

486
00:22:54.281 --> 00:22:57.800
<v Speaker 1>made in grape skins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also blueberries make to a much less</v>

487
00:22:57.801 --> 00:23:00.100
<v Speaker 1>degree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's made to ward off fungus.</v>

488
00:23:00.580 --> 00:23:04.720
<v Speaker 1>And resveratrol has been shown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least if it's in a high dose,</v>

489
00:23:04.910 --> 00:23:08.770
<v Speaker 1>like was milligrams a day to clear away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it activates,</v>

490
00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:14.280
<v Speaker 1>it actually activates this whole genetic</v>
<v Speaker 1>pathway that gets activated when you're </v>

491
00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:17.191
<v Speaker 1>fasting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fasting is another type of hormetic </v>

492
00:23:17.191 --> 00:23:17.191
<v Speaker 1>stress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you're fasting,</v>

493
00:23:17.191 --> 00:23:21.900
<v Speaker 1>you cause damage cells to clear away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You also basically start to turn on all </v>

494
00:23:23.111 --> 00:23:25.390
<v Speaker 1>these genes that help you deal with </v>
<v Speaker 1>stress because your body's like,</v>

495
00:23:25.391 --> 00:23:26.320
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't,</v>

496
00:23:26.410 --> 00:23:27.260
<v Speaker 1>I don't have food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

497
00:23:27.261 --> 00:23:28.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to deal with this.</v>

498
00:23:28.750 --> 00:23:31.200
<v Speaker 1>So you activate all these really good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

499
00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:36.240
<v Speaker 1>genetic pathways where you're making </v>
<v Speaker 1>more antioxidants are making more </v>

500
00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:36.490
<v Speaker 1>antiinflammatories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're making more brain cells,</v>

501
00:23:36.491 --> 00:23:37.720
<v Speaker 1>you're preparing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

502
00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:38.830
<v Speaker 1>just everything good.</v>

503
00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:44.300
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it was a virtual kind of his thought </v>

504
00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:46.681
<v Speaker 1>of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a mimetic of fasting in a way </v>

505
00:23:46.681 --> 00:23:49.831
<v Speaker 1>because it activates like one of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>pathways that get activated and it </v>

506
00:23:49.831 --> 00:23:51.040
<v Speaker 1>changes gene expression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been very skeptical.</v>

507
00:23:51.130 --> 00:23:56.130
<v Speaker 1>There was virtual literature for quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>some time back in 2003 or so when it was</v>

508
00:23:56.781 --> 00:23:59.960
<v Speaker 1>a first first kind of came into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>aging world.</v>

509
00:23:59.990 --> 00:24:04.990
<v Speaker 1>I was very skeptical of it mostly </v>
<v Speaker 1>because a lot of the studies that had </v>

510
00:24:04.990 --> 00:24:05.600
<v Speaker 1>been done in animals where they feed </v>
<v Speaker 1>animals,</v>

511
00:24:05.601 --> 00:24:10.601
<v Speaker 1>Rivera trawl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they feed them such large amounts that </v>

512
00:24:10.601 --> 00:24:11.420
<v Speaker 1>are just like not relevant to humans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I was like,</v>

513
00:24:11.421 --> 00:24:11.960
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what,</v>

514
00:24:12.020 --> 00:24:17.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the more I've been reading about it </v>

515
00:24:17.020 --> 00:24:19.691
<v Speaker 1>recently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more I've become a little more </v>

516
00:24:19.691 --> 00:24:19.691
<v Speaker 1>convinced that there actually may be </v>
<v Speaker 1>something to,</v>

517
00:24:19.691 --> 00:24:24.310
<v Speaker 1>to this reserve or trial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's activating this pathway called </v>

518
00:24:24.310 --> 00:24:27.200
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is globally changing gene </v>

519
00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:27.200
<v Speaker 1>expression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>epigenetics.</v>

520
00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:27.520
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

521
00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:30.860
<v Speaker 1>it's activating all these good things </v>
<v Speaker 1>and deactivating bad things.</v>

522
00:24:30.861 --> 00:24:32.420
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

523
00:24:32.990 --> 00:24:34.580
<v Speaker 1>there's really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really interesting.</v>

524
00:24:34.581 --> 00:24:36.710
<v Speaker 1>There was a study that was published not</v>
<v Speaker 1>long ago,</v>

525
00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:41.920
<v Speaker 1>a couple of years ago that was done in </v>
<v Speaker 1>monkeys were monkeys were given a high </v>

526
00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:43.130
<v Speaker 1>sugar diet and a high sugar high fat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a bad combo.</v>

527
00:24:43.430 --> 00:24:45.560
<v Speaker 1>And it gave him a spiritual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

528
00:24:46.790 --> 00:24:49.280
<v Speaker 1>either gave them a spiritual or didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the monkeys,</v>

529
00:24:49.281 --> 00:24:54.281
<v Speaker 1>I did not get resveratrol.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their arteries were like really stiffed </v>

530
00:24:54.281 --> 00:24:58.030
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>caused their arteries to stiff by like </v>

531
00:24:58.030 --> 00:24:59.591
<v Speaker 1>40 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there was very raspberry trial </v>

532
00:24:59.591 --> 00:24:59.990
<v Speaker 1>completely negated that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I was like,</v>

533
00:24:59.991 --> 00:25:04.991
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe I should start looking into the </v>

534
00:25:04.991 --> 00:25:04.991
<v Speaker 1>rivera trial again because it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little,</v>

535
00:25:04.991 --> 00:25:05.420
<v Speaker 1>it's a little interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

536
00:25:05.421 --> 00:25:07.880
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's so many other plant.</v>

537
00:25:07.881 --> 00:25:12.881
<v Speaker 1>There's a book that was written by an </v>
<v Speaker 1>Indian scientists called plant an Antifa</v>

538
00:25:13.691 --> 00:25:16.580
<v Speaker 1>dense and it's a very dry.</v>

539
00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:17.540
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a textbook,</v>

540
00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:19.150
<v Speaker 1>so it's not like something people like </v>
<v Speaker 1>read,</v>

541
00:25:19.151 --> 00:25:21.770
<v Speaker 1>like for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a textbook really.</v>

542
00:25:22.130 --> 00:25:23.240
<v Speaker 1>But what it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it does,</v>

543
00:25:23.270 --> 00:25:27.200
<v Speaker 1>what he does in this book is there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>over 900 different chemical compounds in</v>

544
00:25:27.201 --> 00:25:32.201
<v Speaker 1>like a variety of plants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a plant in a PR specialist.</v>

545
00:25:32.511 --> 00:25:33.560
<v Speaker 1>So he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's his specialty.</v>

546
00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:37.510
<v Speaker 1>And he categorizes like over 900 of </v>
<v Speaker 1>these compounds were these,</v>

547
00:25:37.690 --> 00:25:38.940
<v Speaker 1>these compounds are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

548
00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:41.600
<v Speaker 1>potentially going to induce a hormetic </v>
<v Speaker 1>response.</v>

549
00:25:42.050 --> 00:25:47.050
<v Speaker 1>And so I know several scientists are </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually using some of these compounds </v>

550
00:25:47.050 --> 00:25:50.801
<v Speaker 1>that are at least listed in this book to</v>
<v Speaker 1>study their effects in mice and </v>

551
00:25:50.801 --> 00:25:52.280
<v Speaker 1>eventually in humans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like some of them,</v>

552
00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:57.010
<v Speaker 1>like I'm plumage in plumage ins and </v>
<v Speaker 1>black walnuts and it's bench.</v>

553
00:25:57.050 --> 00:25:59.630
<v Speaker 1>It actually causes a slight stress in </v>
<v Speaker 1>our brain.</v>

554
00:26:00.110 --> 00:26:05.110
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has been shown in mice to protect </v>

555
00:26:05.110 --> 00:26:05.360
<v Speaker 1>against ischemic stroke because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

556
00:26:05.390 --> 00:26:06.710
<v Speaker 1>it activates all these good things.</v>

557
00:26:06.710 --> 00:26:08.750
<v Speaker 1>It protects against this ischemic </v>
<v Speaker 1>stroke.</v>

558
00:26:09.290 --> 00:26:11.630
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's another one called galantamine,</v>

559
00:26:11.631 --> 00:26:16.631
<v Speaker 1>which is in snowdrop flowers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>galantamine is it also stressful in the </v>

560
00:26:16.671 --> 00:26:17.330
<v Speaker 1>brain?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I said,</v>

561
00:26:17.331 --> 00:26:22.331
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these plant compounds are designed to </v>

562
00:26:22.331 --> 00:26:25.331
<v Speaker 1>target and sick nervous system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's no surprise that are affecting </v>

563
00:26:25.331 --> 00:26:26.150
<v Speaker 1>the nervous system of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of mammals.</v>

564
00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:27.770
<v Speaker 1>And in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this case,</v>

565
00:26:27.771 --> 00:26:32.771
<v Speaker 1>humans swell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>galantamine increases acetylcholine </v>

566
00:26:32.771 --> 00:26:35.951
<v Speaker 1>production in the brain and </v>
<v Speaker 1>acetylcholine plays a role in learning </v>

567
00:26:35.951 --> 00:26:38.330
<v Speaker 1>and memory and it's actually given to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Alzheimer's patients,</v>

568
00:26:38.370 --> 00:26:41.840
<v Speaker 1>galantamine to help them remember </v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

569
00:26:41.841 --> 00:26:43.500
<v Speaker 1>to help them with their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to improve their memory.</v>

570
00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:44.510
<v Speaker 1>But it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

571
00:26:44.540 --> 00:26:47.870
<v Speaker 1>it's just one of those natural </v>
<v Speaker 1>insecticides on alcohol.</v>

572
00:26:47.871 --> 00:26:52.871
<v Speaker 1>Ian is a nootropic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people take acetylcholine just </v>

573
00:26:52.871 --> 00:26:53.280
<v Speaker 1>from memory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

574
00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:55.860
<v Speaker 1>the thing I like about the getting it </v>
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>

575
00:26:55.861 --> 00:27:00.861
<v Speaker 1>I'm getting it from getting it from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>hormetic type of response versus like </v>

576
00:27:01.530 --> 00:27:04.380
<v Speaker 1>let's say someone designed a drug to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

577
00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:09.660
<v Speaker 1>to activate the subtle colon receptor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that you always have these biological</v>

578
00:27:09.661 --> 00:27:12.090
<v Speaker 1>feedback mechanisms when you're.</v>

579
00:27:12.090 --> 00:27:14.250
<v Speaker 1>When you start to activate a receptor in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the brain,</v>

580
00:27:14.670 --> 00:27:16.620
<v Speaker 1>pharmacologically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your brain,</v>

581
00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:18.360
<v Speaker 1>your brain knows your brain's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

582
00:27:18.361 --> 00:27:20.850
<v Speaker 1>I'm getting a lot of this stuff that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't usually get a lot of.</v>

583
00:27:21.180 --> 00:27:23.550
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to stop making as much of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>receptor.</v>

584
00:27:23.551 --> 00:27:26.910
<v Speaker 1>The receptor is what's necessary to have</v>
<v Speaker 1>the physiological response.</v>

585
00:27:27.180 --> 00:27:28.050
<v Speaker 1>So your brain's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

586
00:27:28.051 --> 00:27:30.390
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to stop making as much of</v>
<v Speaker 1>this receptor.</v>

587
00:27:31.020 --> 00:27:34.070
<v Speaker 1>But then what happens is if you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>give it that signal,</v>

588
00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:39.080
<v Speaker 1>if you don't take that drug,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you've got less of that receptor </v>

589
00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:40.950
<v Speaker 1>and so you're going to have massive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like withdrawal.</v>

590
00:27:41.010 --> 00:27:45.510
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be like crazy because now </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever acetylcholine you do make,</v>

591
00:27:45.750 --> 00:27:50.750
<v Speaker 1>it's not going to have much in effect </v>
<v Speaker 1>because there's less of that receptor </v>

592
00:27:50.750 --> 00:27:54.021
<v Speaker 1>there to actually bind to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas when you have something like </v>

593
00:27:54.021 --> 00:27:56.550
<v Speaker 1>galantamine something that's a hormetic </v>
<v Speaker 1>inducer,</v>

594
00:27:56.790 --> 00:28:01.790
<v Speaker 1>what's happening is you're actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not actually doing anything to </v>

595
00:28:01.790 --> 00:28:04.780
<v Speaker 1>acetylcholine neurons or to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

596
00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:05.520
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

597
00:28:05.590 --> 00:28:07.680
<v Speaker 1>the receptor or anything directly.</v>

598
00:28:07.860 --> 00:28:12.860
<v Speaker 1>It's slightly slightly toxic and part of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way your brain deals with the type </v>

599
00:28:12.860 --> 00:28:15.000
<v Speaker 1>of stress that it induces is it goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

600
00:28:15.001 --> 00:28:16.450
<v Speaker 1>this is the kind of stress I need to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make.</v>

601
00:28:16.451 --> 00:28:18.990
<v Speaker 1>I need a seal calling for this for </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever reason,</v>

602
00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:19.920
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

603
00:28:19.940 --> 00:28:22.620
<v Speaker 1>these plants are doing different things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For whatever reason,</v>

604
00:28:23.070 --> 00:28:25.140
<v Speaker 1>the galantamine is like the one that </v>
<v Speaker 1>says,</v>

605
00:28:25.141 --> 00:28:26.130
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Acetylcholine,</v>

606
00:28:26.370 --> 00:28:31.370
<v Speaker 1>so your body is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a response to something kind of </v>

607
00:28:31.370 --> 00:28:31.370
<v Speaker 1>like triggering it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

608
00:28:31.590 --> 00:28:34.650
<v Speaker 1>And so you're not going to have that </v>
<v Speaker 1>feedback mechanism where it's like.</v>

609
00:28:34.940 --> 00:28:38.160
<v Speaker 1>So if you take it into pharmacological,</v>
<v Speaker 1>former pharmaceutical forum.</v>

610
00:28:38.310 --> 00:28:39.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying a lot of,</v>

611
00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:44.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the classic example would be a </v>

612
00:28:44.750 --> 00:28:48.140
<v Speaker 1>opioids opioid painkillers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you're taking an opioid </v>

613
00:28:48.631 --> 00:28:53.631
<v Speaker 1>painkiller,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's happening is there's a couple of </v>

614
00:28:53.631 --> 00:28:57.000
<v Speaker 1>different opioid receptors in the brain </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the opioid painkillers,</v>

615
00:28:57.001 --> 00:29:00.360
<v Speaker 1>kinda like a morphine derivative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is sort of like endorphin.</v>

616
00:29:00.900 --> 00:29:03.600
<v Speaker 1>It binds to something called the new </v>
<v Speaker 1>opioid receptor,</v>

617
00:29:03.630 --> 00:29:08.630
<v Speaker 1>which is what endorphins bind to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's endorphins make you feel </v>

618
00:29:08.630 --> 00:29:11.421
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's also part of the reason why you </v>

619
00:29:11.421 --> 00:29:11.421
<v Speaker 1>exercise while you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

620
00:29:11.421 --> 00:29:11.520
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're wanting that endorphin release.</v>

621
00:29:11.940 --> 00:29:13.880
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what happens when you start to like</v>

622
00:29:13.890 --> 00:29:18.890
<v Speaker 1>make a drug like morphine derivative </v>
<v Speaker 1>type of drug that goes and directly </v>

623
00:29:18.890 --> 00:29:21.630
<v Speaker 1>activates that receptor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>binds to it is that receptor,</v>

624
00:29:21.690 --> 00:29:24.030
<v Speaker 1>the new opioid receptor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you start to make less of it.</v>

625
00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:27.180
<v Speaker 1>And that's been shown when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you give morphine drugs,</v>

626
00:29:27.270 --> 00:29:29.940
<v Speaker 1>you downregulate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you make less of the receptors.</v>

627
00:29:30.330 --> 00:29:33.030
<v Speaker 1>So now what happens is when you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>have that opioid drug,</v>

628
00:29:33.290 --> 00:29:35.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say you had this much receptor,</v>

629
00:29:36.030 --> 00:29:37.560
<v Speaker 1>you started taking the drug,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

630
00:29:37.561 --> 00:29:39.840
<v Speaker 1>And now your receptors going down here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

631
00:29:39.900 --> 00:29:42.130
<v Speaker 1>And so now if you don't have the drug </v>
<v Speaker 1>are down here,</v>

632
00:29:42.131 --> 00:29:44.050
<v Speaker 1>and so any endorphin you make isn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>gonna do much.</v>

633
00:29:44.060 --> 00:29:44.650
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh man,</v>

634
00:29:44.651 --> 00:29:49.651
<v Speaker 1>I need more of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you keep having just to get back </v>

635
00:29:49.651 --> 00:29:49.720
<v Speaker 1>up to baseline,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just to get back up to normal,</v>

636
00:29:49.930 --> 00:29:54.930
<v Speaker 1>which is why you can have addiction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Addiction can be very common with those </v>

637
00:29:54.930 --> 00:29:58.801
<v Speaker 1>types of painkillers because of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>effect on the receptor new opioid </v>

638
00:29:58.801 --> 00:30:00.520
<v Speaker 1>receptor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>

639
00:30:00.521 --> 00:30:02.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the problems.</v>

640
00:30:02.381 --> 00:30:07.381
<v Speaker 1>And interestingly enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's another type of opioid receptor </v>

641
00:30:07.381 --> 00:30:08.830
<v Speaker 1>called the Kappa opioid receptor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

642
00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:09.920
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

643
00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:12.760
<v Speaker 1>I think I've discussed with you before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and one of the podcasts,</v>

644
00:30:12.761 --> 00:30:17.761
<v Speaker 1>because a cap opioid receptors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of the opposite of the new opioid </v>

645
00:30:17.761 --> 00:30:22.141
<v Speaker 1>receptor because it actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you make something in your body </v>

646
00:30:22.141 --> 00:30:25.861
<v Speaker 1>called dynorphins it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's responsible for a dysphoric </v>

647
00:30:25.861 --> 00:30:26.260
<v Speaker 1>feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas new opioids,</v>

648
00:30:26.290 --> 00:30:27.340
<v Speaker 1>euphoric,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you feel good.</v>

649
00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:32.640
<v Speaker 1>Dysphoric feeling is the Kappa opioid </v>
<v Speaker 1>you make dynorphins because it cools </v>

650
00:30:33.191 --> 00:30:35.080
<v Speaker 1>your body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you're hot,</v>

651
00:30:35.081 --> 00:30:36.910
<v Speaker 1>when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you exercise,</v>

652
00:30:36.970 --> 00:30:39.400
<v Speaker 1>when you elevate your core,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you sweat,</v>

653
00:30:40.220 --> 00:30:40.960
<v Speaker 1>that's a good sign.</v>

654
00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:42.540
<v Speaker 1>When you're sweating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're making dynorphins.</v>

655
00:30:42.580 --> 00:30:47.580
<v Speaker 1>When you sit in the sauna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're making dynorphins and you know </v>

656
00:30:47.580 --> 00:30:47.920
<v Speaker 1>when you're working out hard enough that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're sweating,</v>

657
00:30:47.921 --> 00:30:49.180
<v Speaker 1>you're physically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're uncomfortable,</v>

658
00:30:49.181 --> 00:30:49.750
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

659
00:30:49.751 --> 00:30:50.740
<v Speaker 1>damn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this sucks.</v>

660
00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:53.440
<v Speaker 1>You feel uncomfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the same goes when you're sitting in</v>

661
00:30:53.441 --> 00:30:58.441
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a hot sauna and you're sweating and </v>

662
00:30:58.441 --> 00:30:58.441
<v Speaker 1>getting really hot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>

663
00:30:58.441 --> 00:30:59.050
<v Speaker 1>you're just like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You feel dysphoric,</v>

664
00:30:59.051 --> 00:31:02.650
<v Speaker 1>like that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what's happening is dynorphins is</v>

665
00:31:02.651 --> 00:31:04.600
<v Speaker 1>binding to the kappa opioid receptor </v>
<v Speaker 1>will.</v>

666
00:31:04.601 --> 00:31:07.060
<v Speaker 1>The really cool thing about this whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>pathway,</v>

667
00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:10.780
<v Speaker 1>again come to coming back to feedback.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your biology is so smart.</v>

668
00:31:10.781 --> 00:31:14.150
<v Speaker 1>It always figures out a way when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>start to add,</v>

669
00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:16.570
<v Speaker 1>when you start to activate that cap </v>
<v Speaker 1>opioid receptor,</v>

670
00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:17.680
<v Speaker 1>your body's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

671
00:31:17.681 --> 00:31:22.681
<v Speaker 1>I'm getting a lot of this bad stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to like make more of these </v>

672
00:31:22.681 --> 00:31:24.220
<v Speaker 1>receptors because I've got too much of </v>
<v Speaker 1>this dysphoric.</v>

673
00:31:24.460 --> 00:31:29.460
<v Speaker 1>So it actually causes more than caused </v>
<v Speaker 1>your body to make more new opioid </v>

674
00:31:29.460 --> 00:31:34.351
<v Speaker 1>receptors and it makes them sensitive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then the next time you release </v>

675
00:31:34.351 --> 00:31:34.351
<v Speaker 1>Endorphin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know your workout,</v>

676
00:31:34.690 --> 00:31:38.200
<v Speaker 1>boom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it feels even better and it lasts.</v>

677
00:31:38.410 --> 00:31:43.410
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's part of the reason why I know </v>

678
00:31:43.410 --> 00:31:46.690
<v Speaker 1>that there are certain drugs that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>used to treat opioid addiction,</v>

679
00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:52.120
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>activate the capital you would receptor </v>

680
00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:52.300
<v Speaker 1>pathway exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people use Sauna.</v>

681
00:31:52.630 --> 00:31:54.250
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they understand the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mechanism,</v>

682
00:31:54.251 --> 00:31:59.251
<v Speaker 1>but because anything that's going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>help you with dynorphins because people </v>

683
00:31:59.251 --> 00:31:59.320
<v Speaker 1>that are taking opioids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>opioids,</v>

684
00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:04.680
<v Speaker 1>opioid painkillers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are new opioid receptors are </v>

685
00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:04.680
<v Speaker 1>already like down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>down,</v>

686
00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:08.161
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want it back up and dynorphins </v>

687
00:32:08.161 --> 00:32:08.410
<v Speaker 1>activating that cap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>opioid receptor will do that.</v>

688
00:32:08.650 --> 00:32:11.230
<v Speaker 1>It's been shown in multiple studies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

689
00:32:11.260 --> 00:32:15.120
<v Speaker 1>so kinda went on a little rant there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's.</v>

690
00:32:16.350 --> 00:32:17.910
<v Speaker 3>I wanted to ask you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't want to stop you.</v>

691
00:32:18.110 --> 00:32:23.110
<v Speaker 3>I'm the first one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go back to resveratrol and black walnut </v>

692
00:32:23.110 --> 00:32:27.051
<v Speaker 3>and all these different things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do these things work synergistically or </v>

693
00:32:27.051 --> 00:32:29.880
<v Speaker 3>do they cancel each other out or is </v>
<v Speaker 3>there any problems and combining them?</v>

694
00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:31.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>

695
00:32:31.740 --> 00:32:33.150
<v Speaker 1>That's such like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

696
00:32:33.151 --> 00:32:36.720
<v Speaker 1>so the question is synergistically would</v>
<v Speaker 1>mean,</v>

697
00:32:36.721 --> 00:32:39.580
<v Speaker 1>can you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can you then combine two things and have</v>

698
00:32:39.590 --> 00:32:41.020
<v Speaker 1>an even more powerful response?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

699
00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:46.240
<v Speaker 1>Well the thing is is that because these </v>
<v Speaker 1>compounds are targeting different </v>

700
00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:50.771
<v Speaker 1>pathways there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have some overlap which </v>

701
00:32:50.771 --> 00:32:53.960
<v Speaker 1>will have a synergistic effect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're also going to have a diverse.</v>

702
00:32:54.290 --> 00:32:59.290
<v Speaker 1>There's going to be diversity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know you're going to have the </v>

703
00:32:59.290 --> 00:32:59.290
<v Speaker 1>plumage and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the black walnuts,</v>

704
00:32:59.290 --> 00:33:03.430
<v Speaker 1>galantamine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you get your apogen and from </v>

705
00:33:03.430 --> 00:33:03.430
<v Speaker 1>celery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

706
00:33:03.430 --> 00:33:05.570
<v Speaker 1>apogen and causes your brain to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>more neural neurons,</v>

707
00:33:05.571 --> 00:33:08.640
<v Speaker 1>neuro stem cells,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you get the reserve tra,</v>

708
00:33:08.660 --> 00:33:10.580
<v Speaker 1>which is like clearing away damaged </v>
<v Speaker 1>cells.</v>

709
00:33:10.581 --> 00:33:15.581
<v Speaker 1>It's also anti-inflammatory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you go and eat your Kale and </v>

710
00:33:15.581 --> 00:33:18.911
<v Speaker 1>Broccoli.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That makes something called </v>

711
00:33:18.911 --> 00:33:20.110
<v Speaker 1>isothiocyanates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I isothiocyanates are um,</v>

712
00:33:20.390 --> 00:33:25.390
<v Speaker 1>very potent anticancer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they actually change genes.</v>

713
00:33:25.810 --> 00:33:30.810
<v Speaker 1>They change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have genes in our body that are able </v>

714
00:33:30.810 --> 00:33:33.101
<v Speaker 1>to convert a pro carcinogen into a </v>
<v Speaker 1>carcinogen and I'm isolated </v>

715
00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:36.500
<v Speaker 1>isothiocyanates stop that from </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening.</v>

716
00:33:36.501 --> 00:33:41.501
<v Speaker 1>And we also have genes in our body that </v>
<v Speaker 1>can deactivate anything that could </v>

717
00:33:41.501 --> 00:33:42.650
<v Speaker 1>potentially become a carcinogen that </v>
<v Speaker 1>when we're exposed to all sorts of stuff</v>

718
00:33:42.651 --> 00:33:47.651
<v Speaker 1>like everyday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So activating those genes is like super </v>

719
00:33:47.651 --> 00:33:47.651
<v Speaker 1>awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

720
00:33:47.651 --> 00:33:52.091
<v Speaker 1>it's been shown in mice if you like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you give mice a really high dose of </v>

721
00:33:52.091 --> 00:33:52.091
<v Speaker 1>isothiocyanates and then you would </v>
<v Speaker 1>knock,</v>

722
00:33:52.091 --> 00:33:53.870
<v Speaker 1>collate them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you inject them with tumor cells,</v>

723
00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:56.930
<v Speaker 1>they will not form tumors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas the mice that are injected.</v>

724
00:33:57.110 --> 00:34:02.110
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's another study that was done </v>

725
00:34:02.110 --> 00:34:02.210
<v Speaker 1>in humans and men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>men that took around the eight,</v>

726
00:34:02.590 --> 00:34:06.740
<v Speaker 1>a 250 grams of Broccoli or Brussel </v>
<v Speaker 1>sprouts.</v>

727
00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:10.130
<v Speaker 1>So isothiocyanates or in the cruciferous</v>
<v Speaker 1>family of vegetables,</v>

728
00:34:10.190 --> 00:34:11.630
<v Speaker 1>Kale,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Broccoli,</v>

729
00:34:12.200 --> 00:34:13.790
<v Speaker 1>cabbage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brussel sprouts,</v>

730
00:34:13.850 --> 00:34:16.610
<v Speaker 1>Bok Choy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cauliflower,</v>

731
00:34:16.940 --> 00:34:17.180
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

732
00:34:17.180 --> 00:34:18.650
<v Speaker 1>All that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>BRASSICA.</v>

733
00:34:18.950 --> 00:34:21.770
<v Speaker 1>Those are all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They all have isothiocyanates in them.</v>

734
00:34:22.330 --> 00:34:24.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm actually the isothiocyanates are </v>
<v Speaker 1>formed.</v>

735
00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:27.880
<v Speaker 1>They're stored in something and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>plant called glide,</v>

736
00:34:28.070 --> 00:34:33.070
<v Speaker 1>glide costs and rolaids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in order to release the </v>

737
00:34:33.070 --> 00:34:35.150
<v Speaker 1>isothiocyanates that the plants have an </v>
<v Speaker 1>enzyme called myrosinase,</v>

738
00:34:35.151 --> 00:34:38.150
<v Speaker 1>which we have a little bit of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little bit in our saliva,</v>

739
00:34:38.151 --> 00:34:40.010
<v Speaker 1>a little bit in our gut bacteria,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not much.</v>

740
00:34:40.370 --> 00:34:42.740
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and myrosinase is heat sensitive.</v>

741
00:34:42.741 --> 00:34:45.970
<v Speaker 1>So when you heat your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your cruciferous,</v>

742
00:34:45.980 --> 00:34:47.660
<v Speaker 1>you're inactivating about 50 percent of </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

743
00:34:47.661 --> 00:34:50.030
<v Speaker 1>And it's still good to cook vegetables.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

744
00:34:50.210 --> 00:34:52.670
<v Speaker 1>it's good to get both,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the raw,</v>

745
00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:57.800
<v Speaker 1>the raw kale that you put in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>smoothie or the raw broccoli or eating </v>

746
00:34:57.800 --> 00:35:01.290
<v Speaker 1>the raw broccoli,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Broccoli sprouts have seven times more </v>

747
00:35:01.290 --> 00:35:04.810
<v Speaker 1>because they're a young plant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Young again comes back to that when </v>

748
00:35:04.810 --> 00:35:07.811
<v Speaker 1>you're younger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the stress response is more potent </v>

749
00:35:07.811 --> 00:35:07.811
<v Speaker 1>because nature wants you to survive.</v>

750
00:35:07.811 --> 00:35:10.880
<v Speaker 1>So Broccoli sprouts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isothiocyanates or made to ward off,</v>

751
00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:13.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>creatures from eating them.</v>

752
00:35:13.431 --> 00:35:15.940
<v Speaker 1>So the younger the plant is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more they make of it.</v>

753
00:35:15.950 --> 00:35:16.790
<v Speaker 1>And so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

754
00:35:16.791 --> 00:35:19.550
<v Speaker 1>Broccoli sprouts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to actually sprout them.</v>

755
00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:24.640
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have you ever tried Broccoli sprouts </v>

756
00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:24.640
<v Speaker 1>before?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have.</v>

757
00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:26.090
<v Speaker 1>They're pretty pungent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let never made them though.</v>

758
00:35:26.330 --> 00:35:31.330
<v Speaker 1>It's really easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you can order some cds on Amazon </v>

759
00:35:31.330 --> 00:35:34.970
<v Speaker 1>and then get like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like this mesh bag and you put the seeds</v>

760
00:35:34.971 --> 00:35:37.560
<v Speaker 1>in and then you wet the bag and you just</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep at every day.</v>

761
00:35:37.561 --> 00:35:39.690
<v Speaker 1>And after about five days you'll have </v>
<v Speaker 1>broccoli sprouts.</v>

762
00:35:39.900 --> 00:35:42.960
<v Speaker 1>So really good on solids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not so good in smoothie.</v>

763
00:35:42.961 --> 00:35:45.510
<v Speaker 1>I used to put them in my smoothie and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

764
00:35:46.170 --> 00:35:47.850
<v Speaker 1>it makes me want to Barf,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's so gross.</v>

765
00:35:48.390 --> 00:35:50.130
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's really good for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's just like,</v>

766
00:35:50.550 --> 00:35:51.480
<v Speaker 1>it's so better.</v>

767
00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:52.230
<v Speaker 1>But then again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

768
00:35:52.231 --> 00:35:55.290
<v Speaker 1>at that when I was doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've gone through so many different.</v>

769
00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:57.080
<v Speaker 1>I'd make different smoothies all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

770
00:35:57.260 --> 00:36:00.000
<v Speaker 1>These are disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My smoothies,</v>

771
00:36:00.001 --> 00:36:01.650
<v Speaker 1>you'd probably Barf,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have no idea.</v>

772
00:36:01.651 --> 00:36:05.550
<v Speaker 1>I have done like Broccoli sprouts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mustard greens,</v>

773
00:36:05.850 --> 00:36:08.150
<v Speaker 1>garlic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you know,</v>

774
00:36:08.190 --> 00:36:09.270
<v Speaker 1>carrots and upset.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that.</v>

775
00:36:09.330 --> 00:36:10.920
<v Speaker 1>But that right there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the.</v>

776
00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:14.370
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever tried mustard greens?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have had mustard greens.</v>

777
00:36:14.371 --> 00:36:16.830
<v Speaker 1>Have no trust in this smoothie bar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'll be like,</v>

778
00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:18.720
<v Speaker 1>you'll think you're drinking hot chili </v>
<v Speaker 1>peppers,</v>

779
00:36:18.890 --> 00:36:23.890
<v Speaker 1>put giant chunks of ginger and four </v>
<v Speaker 1>cloves of garlic for large cloves of </v>

780
00:36:23.890 --> 00:36:26.730
<v Speaker 1>garlic for that is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So garlic.</v>

781
00:36:26.970 --> 00:36:28.980
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's finish the isothiocyanates,</v>

782
00:36:28.981 --> 00:36:33.120
<v Speaker 1>but that it all has to do with these </v>
<v Speaker 1>hormones in the back of my mind.</v>

783
00:36:33.121 --> 00:36:34.390
<v Speaker 1>I still have another question on top of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

784
00:36:34.790 --> 00:36:35.460
<v Speaker 1>Keep going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go,</v>

785
00:36:35.540 --> 00:36:36.630
<v Speaker 1>go dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am.</v>

786
00:36:36.690 --> 00:36:38.160
<v Speaker 1>This is my recent obsession.</v>

787
00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:40.200
<v Speaker 1>Is the plant this plant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>insecticides.</v>

788
00:36:40.201 --> 00:36:43.200
<v Speaker 1>I really think we don't even know what's</v>
<v Speaker 1>in these plants,</v>

789
00:36:43.201 --> 00:36:48.201
<v Speaker 1>but it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know these isothiocyanates men that </v>

790
00:36:48.201 --> 00:36:48.201
<v Speaker 1>ate 200,</v>
<v Speaker 1>250 grams a bit.</v>

791
00:36:48.201 --> 00:36:49.610
<v Speaker 1>They actually in their urine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can have,</v>

792
00:36:49.620 --> 00:36:54.620
<v Speaker 1>there's a biomarker of a compound that </v>
<v Speaker 1>inactivates like a certain carcinogen </v>

793
00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:58.980
<v Speaker 1>that could be potential carcinogen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they increase that by 10 percent.</v>

794
00:36:58.981 --> 00:37:03.981
<v Speaker 1>Meaning that they are doing good stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Basically know the isothiocyanates are </v>

795
00:37:03.981 --> 00:37:07.791
<v Speaker 1>really good for the brain to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes something called a type of </v>

796
00:37:07.791 --> 00:37:07.791
<v Speaker 1>isothiocyanate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His soul for fame,</v>

797
00:37:07.791 --> 00:37:12.440
<v Speaker 1>which is in the Broccoli sprouts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's been shown to like help with </v>

798
00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:15.891
<v Speaker 1>autism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean because it induces a stress </v>

799
00:37:15.891 --> 00:37:18.711
<v Speaker 1>response in the brain and your brain </v>
<v Speaker 1>does all this good stuff and then </v>

800
00:37:18.711 --> 00:37:22.290
<v Speaker 1>there's like apogen and and the celery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a garlic.</v>

801
00:37:22.470 --> 00:37:27.470
<v Speaker 1>The Allison Allison is in garlic and </v>
<v Speaker 1>alice scene is in order to activate </v>

802
00:37:28.680 --> 00:37:33.540
<v Speaker 1>allison,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to chop or blend or two garlic.</v>

803
00:37:33.540 --> 00:37:37.830
<v Speaker 1>So if you just throw alice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>scene itself is not sensitive to heat,</v>

804
00:37:37.831 --> 00:37:40.200
<v Speaker 1>but if you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't chop up the garlic,</v>

805
00:37:40.500 --> 00:37:45.500
<v Speaker 1>the enzymes in the garlic allison won't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>won't get activated and won't release </v>

806
00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:48.230
<v Speaker 1>the allison to swallow a whole clove.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that what you're meaning?</v>

807
00:37:48.231 --> 00:37:51.240
<v Speaker 1>If you swallow a whole club or some </v>
<v Speaker 1>people cook with whole clothes,</v>

808
00:37:51.241 --> 00:37:53.580
<v Speaker 1>they don't chop them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you want to,</v>

809
00:37:53.670 --> 00:37:58.670
<v Speaker 1>if you're cooking with garlic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chopped the garlic and let it sit for </v>

810
00:37:58.670 --> 00:37:59.790
<v Speaker 1>like five to 10 minutes before putting </v>
<v Speaker 1>it in the heat.</v>

811
00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:05.080
<v Speaker 1>Really out on a cutting board.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly that because that you'll get </v>

812
00:38:05.080 --> 00:38:06.440
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll harvest the most.</v>

813
00:38:06.450 --> 00:38:10.130
<v Speaker 1>Allison from allison is another one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These plant natural plant insecticides,</v>

814
00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:12.980
<v Speaker 1>it accentuates as time goes on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

815
00:38:13.050 --> 00:38:15.840
<v Speaker 1>so it just takes a little while for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>enzyme to release it.</v>

816
00:38:15.841 --> 00:38:16.980
<v Speaker 1>So you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it takes a few minutes.</v>

817
00:38:16.981 --> 00:38:18.090
<v Speaker 1>The enzyme release,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it,</v>

818
00:38:18.180 --> 00:38:23.180
<v Speaker 1>even though this plant was picked like </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe a week ago or a month ago or </v>

819
00:38:23.180 --> 00:38:27.441
<v Speaker 1>whatever has to break the rules of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>garlic for the alice and a's to get </v>

820
00:38:27.441 --> 00:38:29.400
<v Speaker 1>released,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but more of it releases over time.</v>

821
00:38:29.460 --> 00:38:30.780
<v Speaker 1>That seems so strange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

822
00:38:30.781 --> 00:38:32.990
<v Speaker 1>it's not that more of it releases.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just that you're,</v>

823
00:38:33.120 --> 00:38:35.100
<v Speaker 1>you have to give it time to like for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>enzymes,</v>

824
00:38:35.350 --> 00:38:38.230
<v Speaker 1>get activated and release it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't take that long.</v>

825
00:38:38.530 --> 00:38:40.570
<v Speaker 1>I mean honestly if you were to wait like</v>
<v Speaker 1>five minutes,</v>

826
00:38:40.630 --> 00:38:44.230
<v Speaker 1>you'd be fine probably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm just on the cautious side,</v>

827
00:38:44.610 --> 00:38:46.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like to wait like five or 10 minutes.</v>

828
00:38:47.170 --> 00:38:48.940
<v Speaker 1>But yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you just,</v>

829
00:38:48.941 --> 00:38:51.910
<v Speaker 1>if you just chop the garlic and </v>
<v Speaker 1>immediately it's the enzymes have to get</v>

830
00:38:51.911 --> 00:38:54.370
<v Speaker 1>activated and then they chop it up and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then the is released.</v>

831
00:38:54.371 --> 00:38:59.371
<v Speaker 1>So that just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that takes a couple of minutes and just </v>

832
00:38:59.371 --> 00:39:01.181
<v Speaker 1>seems odd to me that there's a process </v>
<v Speaker 1>once it's been picked and it's sitting </v>

833
00:39:01.181 --> 00:39:01.181
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's obviously not alive anymore,</v>

834
00:39:01.420 --> 00:39:03.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's sitting in like a little bowl.</v>

835
00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:08.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the enzymes not active until you </v>

836
00:39:08.360 --> 00:39:08.360
<v Speaker 1>break the garlic's been picked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's in like a club thing,</v>

837
00:39:08.360 --> 00:39:08.360
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

838
00:39:08.650 --> 00:39:13.650
<v Speaker 1>You have to open it out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to get it out of the club and </v>

839
00:39:13.650 --> 00:39:15.040
<v Speaker 1>cut the cell wall to activate these </v>
<v Speaker 1>enzymes.</v>

840
00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:20.280
<v Speaker 1>When I don't feel good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I chew a whole clove of garlic taste to </v>

841
00:39:20.280 --> 00:39:20.280
<v Speaker 1>do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

842
00:39:20.280 --> 00:39:20.770
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

843
00:39:20.771 --> 00:39:22.630
<v Speaker 1>it's antimicrobial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have very,</v>

844
00:39:22.631 --> 00:39:26.290
<v Speaker 1>very potent antimicrobial activities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It kills a wide variety of bacteria.</v>

845
00:39:26.291 --> 00:39:28.420
<v Speaker 1>When you talked about that mercer case </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you had,</v>

846
00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:33.130
<v Speaker 1>and I related that to everybody because </v>
<v Speaker 1>my friend denny had a really bad case of</v>

847
00:39:33.131 --> 00:39:35.860
<v Speaker 1>Murcia and I told him about your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your situation.</v>

848
00:39:35.861 --> 00:39:39.130
<v Speaker 1>He had it actually after you had been on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the podcast last time.</v>

849
00:39:39.340 --> 00:39:42.910
<v Speaker 1>And I um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I told him that his photos insane.</v>

850
00:39:42.911 --> 00:39:45.850
<v Speaker 1>He's got a photo that I put on my </v>
<v Speaker 1>instagram page of his knee.</v>

851
00:39:46.180 --> 00:39:46.720
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>

852
00:39:46.780 --> 00:39:51.370
<v Speaker 1>his knee got within a couple of days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It went from being like mildly infected,</v>

853
00:39:51.371 --> 00:39:52.450
<v Speaker 1>like what's going on too.</v>

854
00:39:52.750 --> 00:39:55.210
<v Speaker 1>He was in the hospital for weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Massive,</v>

855
00:39:55.270 --> 00:39:58.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I intravenous antibiotics.</v>

856
00:39:58.780 --> 00:39:59.900
<v Speaker 1>The whole deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

857
00:39:59.980 --> 00:40:04.980
<v Speaker 1>Awful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I told him about what you had done with </v>

858
00:40:04.980 --> 00:40:04.980
<v Speaker 1>a grape seed extract was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was.</v>

859
00:40:05.860 --> 00:40:10.860
<v Speaker 1>I should probably clarify.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not exactly sure it was mrs because </v>

860
00:40:10.860 --> 00:40:14.311
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't actually cultured,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I assume it was because it came back </v>

861
00:40:14.311 --> 00:40:14.311
<v Speaker 1>like three times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>

862
00:40:14.340 --> 00:40:17.780
<v Speaker 1>So I probably one way or another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I,</v>

863
00:40:17.930 --> 00:40:22.930
<v Speaker 1>I took a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was taking garlic pills like every </v>

864
00:40:22.930 --> 00:40:22.930
<v Speaker 1>hour,</v>
<v Speaker 1>grapefruit seed extract,</v>

865
00:40:22.930 --> 00:40:27.160
<v Speaker 1>every app I tend to get enough is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>garlic extract from a pill.</v>

866
00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:30.130
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the question is,</v>

867
00:40:30.131 --> 00:40:30.970
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

868
00:40:31.270 --> 00:40:36.270
<v Speaker 1>there's aged garlic and then there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>just regular garlic pills and then </v>

869
00:40:36.431 --> 00:40:38.210
<v Speaker 1>there's fresh garlic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

870
00:40:38.540 --> 00:40:43.540
<v Speaker 1>it all depends if some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the garlic that is aged has </v>

871
00:40:43.540 --> 00:40:45.550
<v Speaker 1>allison in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't have other mcap in it.</v>

872
00:40:45.790 --> 00:40:47.800
<v Speaker 1>There's other mcap tens that are doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>other things.</v>

873
00:40:48.190 --> 00:40:50.380
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does the more competent mcap 10.</v>

874
00:40:50.410 --> 00:40:50.950
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

875
00:40:50.951 --> 00:40:54.040
<v Speaker 1>it's another byproduct of these plant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

876
00:40:54.050 --> 00:40:57.310
<v Speaker 1>insecticides and recap attends our </v>
<v Speaker 1>first,</v>

877
00:40:57.311 --> 00:41:00.310
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they bind mercury very well,</v>

878
00:41:00.311 --> 00:41:03.790
<v Speaker 1>so they will bind mercury and like help </v>
<v Speaker 1>you excrete it,</v>

879
00:41:04.060 --> 00:41:07.060
<v Speaker 1>so they bind mercury that's in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>system and you excrete it and they also,</v>

880
00:41:07.061 --> 00:41:08.860
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

881
00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:09.930
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

882
00:41:10.810 --> 00:41:15.810
<v Speaker 1>do something in your brain so that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>can actually cross over the blood brain </v>

883
00:41:15.810 --> 00:41:18.571
<v Speaker 1>barrier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get into your brain and they're potent </v>

884
00:41:18.571 --> 00:41:18.880
<v Speaker 1>antioxidant in the cell membrane,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

885
00:41:19.270 --> 00:41:24.270
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of technical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's hard to find antioxidants that </v>

886
00:41:24.270 --> 00:41:27.121
<v Speaker 1>are in the cell membrane itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of the time they're soluble in </v>

887
00:41:27.121 --> 00:41:30.271
<v Speaker 1>itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's actually very good for your </v>

888
00:41:30.271 --> 00:41:30.271
<v Speaker 1>brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

889
00:41:30.271 --> 00:41:34.440
<v Speaker 1>but so I was taking the garlic oil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>garlic oil would have it,</v>

890
00:41:35.031 --> 00:41:37.280
<v Speaker 1>should have both,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both of those.</v>

891
00:41:37.790 --> 00:41:42.790
<v Speaker 1>And I was also rubbing it on my sore </v>
<v Speaker 1>topically says rubbing it on there and </v>

892
00:41:42.790 --> 00:41:43.460
<v Speaker 1>taking it orally.</v>

893
00:41:43.610 --> 00:41:45.110
<v Speaker 1>Grapes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Grapefruit seed extract.</v>

894
00:41:45.380 --> 00:41:50.380
<v Speaker 1>I've taken Ginkgo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ginkgo Biloba because that was also </v>

895
00:41:50.380 --> 00:41:50.380
<v Speaker 1>shown to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

896
00:41:50.380 --> 00:41:53.180
<v Speaker 1>to kill a different staphylococcus </v>
<v Speaker 1>strains and vitamin C.</v>

897
00:41:53.330 --> 00:41:54.770
<v Speaker 1>and I was taking this stuff like every </v>
<v Speaker 1>hour,</v>

898
00:41:55.730 --> 00:41:58.910
<v Speaker 1>every hour just overloading your sister </v>
<v Speaker 1>like garlic was.</v>

899
00:41:58.911 --> 00:42:01.390
<v Speaker 1>It was like massive garlic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

900
00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:02.500
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

901
00:42:02.630 --> 00:42:04.070
<v Speaker 1>the garlic itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

902
00:42:04.071 --> 00:42:09.071
<v Speaker 1>it's antimicrobial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also there was a study that was </v>

903
00:42:09.071 --> 00:42:10.070
<v Speaker 1>recently published,</v>
<v Speaker 1>men that had like Atherosclerosis,</v>

904
00:42:10.580 --> 00:42:15.580
<v Speaker 1>they were given two point four grams of </v>
<v Speaker 1>garlic a day and it actually slowed the </v>

905
00:42:17.211 --> 00:42:22.211
<v Speaker 1>accumulation of plaques in their </v>
<v Speaker 1>arteries by like 80 percent because </v>

906
00:42:22.211 --> 00:42:25.781
<v Speaker 1>allison is a very potent anti </v>
<v Speaker 1>inflammatory and it helps the </v>

907
00:42:25.781 --> 00:42:29.441
<v Speaker 1>endothelial cells,</v>
<v Speaker 1>helps reduce inflammation that </v>

908
00:42:29.441 --> 00:42:29.441
<v Speaker 1>endothelial cells.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's good,</v>

909
00:42:29.441 --> 00:42:32.000
<v Speaker 1>it's really good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Allison,</v>

910
00:42:33.370 --> 00:42:35.660
<v Speaker 1>it just goes on and on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know.</v>

911
00:42:35.661 --> 00:42:38.360
<v Speaker 1>There's so many different compounds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but these are just ones we know of,</v>

912
00:42:38.870 --> 00:42:40.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just,</v>

913
00:42:40.770 --> 00:42:44.240
<v Speaker 1>they're doing really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really positive and potent things.</v>

914
00:42:44.510 --> 00:42:46.030
<v Speaker 1>Curcumin is one that I've been obsessed </v>
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>

915
00:42:46.031 --> 00:42:48.010
<v Speaker 1>We going to talk about that later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I took a lot of curcumin.</v>

916
00:42:48.290 --> 00:42:50.040
<v Speaker 1>I take that every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

917
00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:52.940
<v Speaker 1>I have been obsessed with a certain form</v>
<v Speaker 1>of it,</v>

918
00:42:52.970 --> 00:42:56.660
<v Speaker 1>this formulation of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I know we've talked about this before</v>

919
00:42:56.661 --> 00:42:58.130
<v Speaker 1>on the podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but could human,</v>

920
00:42:58.160 --> 00:43:00.350
<v Speaker 1>there's a couple of problems with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bioavailability of it.</v>

921
00:43:00.710 --> 00:43:04.070
<v Speaker 1>The first is I like your stomach acid </v>
<v Speaker 1>and your intestines,</v>

922
00:43:04.071 --> 00:43:06.530
<v Speaker 1>like you just can't get past that very </v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

923
00:43:06.890 --> 00:43:10.280
<v Speaker 1>So it doesn't actually get absorbed and </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever does get absorbed,</v>

924
00:43:10.520 --> 00:43:14.690
<v Speaker 1>it's like immediately cleared because </v>
<v Speaker 1>your body's like a toxic no go away.</v>

925
00:43:15.290 --> 00:43:16.580
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so taking,</v>

926
00:43:16.610 --> 00:43:18.800
<v Speaker 1>taking curcumin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is in Tumeric,</v>

927
00:43:19.080 --> 00:43:20.690
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's in the tumor at plant,</v>

928
00:43:21.110 --> 00:43:23.000
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is,</v>

929
00:43:24.230 --> 00:43:26.210
<v Speaker 1>you can be taking it but not getting a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot.</v>

930
00:43:26.420 --> 00:43:27.530
<v Speaker 1>It's not doing a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

931
00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:28.670
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

932
00:43:28.700 --> 00:43:30.930
<v Speaker 1>there's this new formulation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how new it is,</v>

933
00:43:30.950 --> 00:43:35.950
<v Speaker 1>new to my mind knew to Rhonda a where </v>
<v Speaker 1>they take the curcumin and it's put in a</v>

934
00:43:37.941 --> 00:43:41.030
<v Speaker 1>fight his own,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is sort of like a Lyposomal,</v>

935
00:43:41.480 --> 00:43:44.570
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a little different to liposomes</v>

936
00:43:44.660 --> 00:43:48.920
<v Speaker 1>contain a chemical compound like in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>middle of it.</v>

937
00:43:48.920 --> 00:43:53.920
<v Speaker 1>So they have like a phospho lipid kind </v>
<v Speaker 1>of complex that contains a compound and </v>

938
00:43:53.920 --> 00:43:56.330
<v Speaker 1>it's supposed to increase </v>
<v Speaker 1>bioavailability because it gets past the</v>

939
00:43:56.540 --> 00:43:59.720
<v Speaker 1>intestinal system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also it can just fuse with your cell</v>

940
00:43:59.721 --> 00:44:04.721
<v Speaker 1>membrane and just deliver the contents </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the cell so it can bypass </v>

941
00:44:04.721 --> 00:44:04.860
<v Speaker 1>transporters and all this other stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fight.</v>

942
00:44:04.870 --> 00:44:09.870
<v Speaker 1>His homes are very similar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They also have this would like this </v>

943
00:44:09.870 --> 00:44:10.010
<v Speaker 1>possible lipid complex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In this case,</v>

944
00:44:10.011 --> 00:44:15.011
<v Speaker 1>they use phosphatidylcholine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it also disperses the compound </v>

945
00:44:15.011 --> 00:44:17.570
<v Speaker 1>throughout and supposedly it like it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to be more bioavailable.</v>

946
00:44:17.750 --> 00:44:22.750
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that's really true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I have been reading some published </v>

947
00:44:22.750 --> 00:44:25.400
<v Speaker 1>studies using this certain formulation </v>
<v Speaker 1>of curcumin in the,</v>

948
00:44:25.420 --> 00:44:30.420
<v Speaker 1>in a fight his own,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is phosphatidylcholine and the </v>

949
00:44:30.420 --> 00:44:30.770
<v Speaker 1>formulation is got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pat did a name,</v>

950
00:44:30.771 --> 00:44:33.610
<v Speaker 1>it's called Meriva,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

951
00:44:33.930 --> 00:44:38.930
<v Speaker 1>if there is curcumin and in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a liposome is probably working the </v>

952
00:44:38.930 --> 00:44:38.930
<v Speaker 1>same way.</v>

953
00:44:38.930 --> 00:44:43.560
<v Speaker 1>I just doubt that dispersing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>molecules like within the actual </v>

954
00:44:44.070 --> 00:44:45.990
<v Speaker 1>lyposomal makes that big of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>difference.</v>

955
00:44:46.020 --> 00:44:51.020
<v Speaker 1>It's more about getting past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what this does is it gets you past </v>

956
00:44:51.020 --> 00:44:54.321
<v Speaker 1>the absorption issue and it also gets </v>
<v Speaker 1>passed it because it fuses with the </v>

957
00:44:54.321 --> 00:44:57.390
<v Speaker 1>cells quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It gets past some of the other,</v>

958
00:44:57.450 --> 00:44:59.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting rid of it quickly issue.</v>

959
00:45:00.150 --> 00:45:05.150
<v Speaker 1>But I've been taking it like I've been </v>
<v Speaker 1>taking at least a gram a day gram a day </v>

960
00:45:06.090 --> 00:45:07.080
<v Speaker 1>of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

961
00:45:07.081 --> 00:45:10.260
<v Speaker 1>what got me really hooked on it was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>couple of studies that came out,</v>

962
00:45:10.261 --> 00:45:12.270
<v Speaker 1>clinical studies that were done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well.</v>

963
00:45:12.271 --> 00:45:14.790
<v Speaker 1>First,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was one that showed,</v>

964
00:45:14.820 --> 00:45:17.680
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that were running downhill,</v>

965
00:45:17.700 --> 00:45:22.700
<v Speaker 1>like exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some sort of running downhill that </v>

966
00:45:22.700 --> 00:45:23.760
<v Speaker 1>caused delayed onset muscle soreness to </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>

967
00:45:23.761 --> 00:45:27.750
<v Speaker 1>So whatever it was about the running </v>
<v Speaker 1>downhill caused sounding deceleration.</v>

968
00:45:27.810 --> 00:45:29.270
<v Speaker 1>Is that what it is?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rough.</v>

969
00:45:29.960 --> 00:45:34.680
<v Speaker 1>You were to run a pill on your body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on your body than running downhill is.</v>

970
00:45:34.830 --> 00:45:37.050
<v Speaker 1>I don't know about your brain though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your brain's like,</v>

971
00:45:37.070 --> 00:45:37.780
<v Speaker 1>oh no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

972
00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:38.640
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm done.</v>

973
00:45:39.390 --> 00:45:40.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

974
00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:42.570
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was shown to reduce the,</v>

975
00:45:42.571 --> 00:45:47.571
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the delayed onset muscle soreness by </v>

976
00:45:47.571 --> 00:45:47.571
<v Speaker 1>like twofold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>taking one gram,</v>

977
00:45:47.670 --> 00:45:50.370
<v Speaker 1>one gram twice a day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that kind of subjective though?</v>

978
00:45:50.371 --> 00:45:51.900
<v Speaker 1>When you say look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reducing soreness,</v>

979
00:45:51.901 --> 00:45:54.510
<v Speaker 1>it's so hard to gauge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is absolutely.</v>

980
00:45:54.511 --> 00:45:57.000
<v Speaker 1>That absolutely is subjective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And same with the other.</v>

981
00:45:57.060 --> 00:45:59.610
<v Speaker 1>There's another publication where people</v>
<v Speaker 1>were given.</v>

982
00:45:59.920 --> 00:46:04.920
<v Speaker 1>There's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a more quantitative quantified </v>

983
00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:04.920
<v Speaker 1>publication,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>

984
00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:09.450
<v Speaker 1>this was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was done in people that had like </v>

985
00:46:09.450 --> 00:46:09.840
<v Speaker 1>osteoarthritis arthritis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were given one gram.</v>

986
00:46:10.050 --> 00:46:12.530
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was just one grant a day,</v>

987
00:46:12.550 --> 00:46:15.270
<v Speaker 1>not two grams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think it was one gram a day and it,</v>

988
00:46:15.330 --> 00:46:20.330
<v Speaker 1>it actually reduced their inflammatory </v>
<v Speaker 1>markers by like 68 percent.</v>

989
00:46:21.660 --> 00:46:26.660
<v Speaker 1>It reduced their symptoms of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also there it increase their </v>

990
00:46:26.660 --> 00:46:26.660
<v Speaker 1>mobility.</v>

991
00:46:26.660 --> 00:46:27.420
<v Speaker 1>So they checked their mobility,</v>
<v Speaker 1>increase their mobility,</v>

992
00:46:27.421 --> 00:46:29.850
<v Speaker 1>blake fourfold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they were actually moving more,</v>

993
00:46:30.750 --> 00:46:35.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so that's the reason maybe because </v>

994
00:46:35.750 --> 00:46:36.210
<v Speaker 1>of the influence anti-inflammation </v>
<v Speaker 1>properties.</v>

995
00:46:36.211 --> 00:46:40.200
<v Speaker 1>Curcumin is very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very potent antiinflammatory way more,</v>

996
00:46:40.460 --> 00:46:45.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it acts very different than a typical </v>

997
00:46:45.460 --> 00:46:47.991
<v Speaker 1>antiinflammatories do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there was a study done in mice were </v>

998
00:46:47.991 --> 00:46:51.000
<v Speaker 1>mice were given like a very high dose of</v>
<v Speaker 1>not this formulation,</v>

999
00:46:51.001 --> 00:46:56.001
<v Speaker 1>just regular curcumin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're given like 100 milligrams per </v>

1000
00:46:56.001 --> 00:46:56.001
<v Speaker 1>kilogram body weight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is like insane.</v>

1001
00:46:56.010 --> 00:46:59.670
<v Speaker 1>It's like eight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eight grams for 180 pound male,</v>

1002
00:47:00.030 --> 00:47:02.220
<v Speaker 1>which is a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's a lot of curcumin.</v>

1003
00:47:02.650 --> 00:47:07.650
<v Speaker 1>What does that look like in your hand?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Big Pile probably to bowl.</v>

1004
00:47:09.450 --> 00:47:12.480
<v Speaker 1>I did see because I was kinda concerned </v>
<v Speaker 1>about toxicity.</v>

1005
00:47:12.481 --> 00:47:16.890
<v Speaker 1>I did see one study that was done on </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that had cancer.</v>

1006
00:47:17.130 --> 00:47:22.130
<v Speaker 1>They were given eight grams of curcumin </v>
<v Speaker 1>a day for three weeks and there was no </v>

1007
00:47:22.130 --> 00:47:22.410
<v Speaker 1>side effects.</v>

1008
00:47:23.190 --> 00:47:23.970
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot,</v>

1009
00:47:24.180 --> 00:47:25.170
<v Speaker 1>it's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1010
00:47:25.210 --> 00:47:30.210
<v Speaker 1>I personally think the </v>
<v Speaker 1>phosphatidylcholine complex is a better </v>

1011
00:47:30.210 --> 00:47:32.980
<v Speaker 1>approach because there's only one </v>
<v Speaker 1>proprietary formulation of that.</v>

1012
00:47:33.030 --> 00:47:37.480
<v Speaker 1>I think there's an Maria Eva and there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>another one someone recently shared with</v>

1013
00:47:37.481 --> 00:47:38.110
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lung,</v>

1014
00:47:38.380 --> 00:47:43.380
<v Speaker 1>Lung Jebediah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So would you recommend the standardized </v>

1015
00:47:43.380 --> 00:47:44.560
<v Speaker 1>stuff that you get at a regular vitamin </v>
<v Speaker 1>store or.</v>

1016
00:47:44.561 --> 00:47:48.250
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually think the phosphatidylcholine</v>

1017
00:47:48.251 --> 00:47:53.251
<v Speaker 1>complex is um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is superior because of the bio </v>

1018
00:47:53.881 --> 00:47:58.881
<v Speaker 1>availability issues and because it is </v>
<v Speaker 1>fusing with your cell membrane and </v>

1019
00:47:58.881 --> 00:48:00.220
<v Speaker 1>getting just the biology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll make sense.</v>

1020
00:48:00.221 --> 00:48:03.520
<v Speaker 1>Plus there's actual studies showing that</v>
<v Speaker 1>it works and you know,</v>

1021
00:48:03.521 --> 00:48:05.830
<v Speaker 1>there was another study,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so this mouse study where they gave them</v>

1022
00:48:05.831 --> 00:48:09.860
<v Speaker 1>eight grams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the whole point of this study was,</v>

1023
00:48:09.861 --> 00:48:11.530
<v Speaker 1>was they injured the mice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They like,</v>

1024
00:48:12.050 --> 00:48:15.160
<v Speaker 1>they did some sort of force so far they </v>
<v Speaker 1>put forest.</v>

1025
00:48:15.170 --> 00:48:16.150
<v Speaker 1>It was so messed up.</v>

1026
00:48:16.150 --> 00:48:19.660
<v Speaker 1>Now you have no idea how many of my </v>
<v Speaker 1>killed like my,</v>

1027
00:48:20.320 --> 00:48:21.820
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my scientific career,</v>

1028
00:48:21.850 --> 00:48:22.990
<v Speaker 1>I don't do it anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to,</v>

1029
00:48:23.050 --> 00:48:27.820
<v Speaker 1>I'd killed hundreds of mice in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>vegans will come.</v>

1030
00:48:28.020 --> 00:48:31.210
<v Speaker 1>It's for Madison harvest that I would </v>
<v Speaker 1>have killed her.</v>

1031
00:48:31.211 --> 00:48:33.310
<v Speaker 1>You're a speciesist was so awful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>

1032
00:48:33.580 --> 00:48:38.500
<v Speaker 1>like the awful part about this is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I used to go and kill mice to get the</v>

1033
00:48:38.501 --> 00:48:40.690
<v Speaker 1>organs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I would get their livers,</v>

1034
00:48:41.020 --> 00:48:43.240
<v Speaker 1>which is one reason why I have a hard </v>
<v Speaker 1>time cooking liver because I'm like,</v>

1035
00:48:43.260 --> 00:48:44.680
<v Speaker 1>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wrote in liver.</v>

1036
00:48:44.710 --> 00:48:46.630
<v Speaker 1>Oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the consistency is like the same</v>

1037
00:48:46.631 --> 00:48:48.310
<v Speaker 1>as beef liver.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1038
00:48:48.850 --> 00:48:50.500
<v Speaker 1>I get their livers and thymus and </v>
<v Speaker 1>spleen.</v>

1039
00:48:50.530 --> 00:48:54.850
<v Speaker 1>But with the sad part was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that I had gas them so I'd go to them</v>

1040
00:48:55.660 --> 00:48:58.390
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I was doing this like everyday it was</v>

1041
00:48:58.391 --> 00:49:00.040
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fine and give me some ice.</v>

1042
00:49:00.040 --> 00:49:00.970
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to guess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1043
00:49:00.971 --> 00:49:02.050
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't care.</v>

1044
00:49:02.051 --> 00:49:04.690
<v Speaker 1>I mean I was one of those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know but call it,</v>

1045
00:49:04.691 --> 00:49:07.810
<v Speaker 1>but the thing that stirs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the scary thing.</v>

1046
00:49:07.811 --> 00:49:09.490
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I first started doing it,</v>

1047
00:49:09.491 --> 00:49:12.850
<v Speaker 1>it was really hard and I felt really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really bad.</v>

1048
00:49:12.880 --> 00:49:15.100
<v Speaker 1>Like tears.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I was sad.</v>

1049
00:49:15.101 --> 00:49:15.670
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1050
00:49:15.671 --> 00:49:16.610
<v Speaker 1>I can't do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1051
00:49:16.840 --> 00:49:18.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to get your phd.</v>

1052
00:49:18.161 --> 00:49:18.550
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1053
00:49:18.551 --> 00:49:19.570
<v Speaker 1>I'll do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll do it.</v>

1054
00:49:20.350 --> 00:49:25.350
<v Speaker 1>So it was hard for me at first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I totally got used to it where it was </v>

1055
00:49:25.350 --> 00:49:25.600
<v Speaker 1>like nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I didn't even think twice.</v>

1056
00:49:25.730 --> 00:49:30.730
<v Speaker 1>I just take a handful of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put them in the little box and had </v>

1057
00:49:30.730 --> 00:49:32.860
<v Speaker 1>gasoline.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was so fucked up.</v>

1058
00:49:32.950 --> 00:49:33.940
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

1059
00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:38.590
<v Speaker 1>and here's the other scary part is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>then I would have long periods of time.</v>

1060
00:49:39.520 --> 00:49:44.520
<v Speaker 1>I'm a very empathetic person that people</v>
<v Speaker 1>to like I really am just that have long </v>

1061
00:49:44.520 --> 00:49:47.640
<v Speaker 1>periods of time when I didn't kill the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mice and then I'd have to go back there.</v>

1062
00:49:47.641 --> 00:49:52.641
<v Speaker 1>So like months would go by and then I </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to go back and do it and all of a </v>

1063
00:49:52.641 --> 00:49:54.400
<v Speaker 1>sudden I was like I can't do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I couldn't watch them.</v>

1064
00:49:54.401 --> 00:49:56.500
<v Speaker 1>They'd start breathing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1065
00:49:56.501 --> 00:50:01.501
<v Speaker 1>and trying to gasp for air and I just </v>
<v Speaker 1>felt awful and so I'm just glad I don't </v>

1066
00:50:01.501 --> 00:50:02.980
<v Speaker 1>do that anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I moved onto humans,</v>

1067
00:50:03.280 --> 00:50:04.630
<v Speaker 1>take their blood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take their blood,</v>

1068
00:50:04.631 --> 00:50:06.580
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's better for them that way.</v>

1069
00:50:06.640 --> 00:50:07.420
<v Speaker 1>It's better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1070
00:50:07.450 --> 00:50:08.940
<v Speaker 1>You're helping them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1071
00:50:09.040 --> 00:50:09.880
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1072
00:50:09.881 --> 00:50:11.020
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mouse stuff,</v>

1073
00:50:11.021 --> 00:50:11.560
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

1074
00:50:11.561 --> 00:50:15.360
<v Speaker 1>there was you like when you have to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>something and you know,</v>

1075
00:50:15.380 --> 00:50:17.800
<v Speaker 1>I was medical science doing cancer </v>
<v Speaker 1>research.</v>

1076
00:50:17.801 --> 00:50:22.250
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't just doing it for fun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was definitely um,</v>

1077
00:50:22.960 --> 00:50:27.200
<v Speaker 1>is strange feeling to like feel that </v>
<v Speaker 1>desensitized sensitizer I'm like,</v>

1078
00:50:27.201 --> 00:50:27.690
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>

1079
00:50:27.700 --> 00:50:29.690
<v Speaker 1>and I've been doing this for like four </v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

1080
00:50:29.691 --> 00:50:31.370
<v Speaker 1>Why am I all and caring about this </v>
<v Speaker 1>again?</v>

1081
00:50:31.640 --> 00:50:33.500
<v Speaker 1>Just take a little break.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1082
00:50:33.501 --> 00:50:36.950
<v Speaker 1>Because I was doing other experiments </v>
<v Speaker 1>that didn't require that I had to kill,</v>

1083
00:50:37.040 --> 00:50:39.080
<v Speaker 1>kill mice and get their liver.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But.</v>

1084
00:50:39.360 --> 00:50:44.360
<v Speaker 2>So would you recommend taking regular </v>
<v Speaker 2>curcumin that you get from a regular </v>

1085
00:50:45.571 --> 00:50:47.850
<v Speaker 2>vitamin store or do you think there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>some benefit of it?</v>

1086
00:50:47.990 --> 00:50:49.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>

1087
00:50:49.400 --> 00:50:53.210
<v Speaker 1>But it's just not as much as much </v>
<v Speaker 1>because first of all,</v>

1088
00:50:53.211 --> 00:50:54.590
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to absorb as much of </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1089
00:50:54.591 --> 00:50:57.260
<v Speaker 1>And second of all you're going to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1090
00:50:57.280 --> 00:50:59.310
<v Speaker 1>clear it away quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1091
00:50:59.400 --> 00:51:02.480
<v Speaker 2>but what is there a better formula of </v>
<v Speaker 2>resveratrol?</v>

1092
00:51:02.690 --> 00:51:07.690
<v Speaker 2>Resveratrol?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Supposedly there's some of it in wine </v>

1093
00:51:07.690 --> 00:51:10.551
<v Speaker 2>which they were trying to correlate with</v>
<v Speaker 2>the positive health benefits of drinking</v>

1094
00:51:10.621 --> 00:51:13.320
<v Speaker 2>glass of wine a day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But as far as I understand,</v>

1095
00:51:13.321 --> 00:51:14.250
<v Speaker 2>it's a small amount.</v>

1096
00:51:14.650 --> 00:51:18.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if five ounce glass of wine has about</v>

1097
00:51:18.101 --> 00:51:21.910
<v Speaker 1>two milligrams of Risperdal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which if you're talking about this study</v>

1098
00:51:21.911 --> 00:51:24.730
<v Speaker 1>I talked about in monkeys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were given like 480 milligrams.</v>

1099
00:51:25.470 --> 00:51:26.310
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1100
00:51:26.311 --> 00:51:28.570
<v Speaker 1>you're not gonna like monkey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not gonna yeah.</v>

1101
00:51:28.571 --> 00:51:30.130
<v Speaker 1>For a monkey and you're not going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>

1102
00:51:30.220 --> 00:51:32.050
<v Speaker 1>So you're not going to like have that </v>
<v Speaker 1>same effect.</v>

1103
00:51:32.051 --> 00:51:37.051
<v Speaker 1>And like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're a thousand milligrams was for </v>

1104
00:51:37.051 --> 00:51:37.051
<v Speaker 1>the clearing of the topic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>clearing away damaged cells.</v>

1105
00:51:37.051 --> 00:51:38.290
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are,</v>

1106
00:51:38.440 --> 00:51:39.540
<v Speaker 1>these are a little chemical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are,</v>

1107
00:51:39.580 --> 00:51:44.580
<v Speaker 1>these are chemical compounds that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>triggering something in our body and </v>

1108
00:51:44.580 --> 00:51:46.300
<v Speaker 1>whether it's two milligrams or 400 </v>
<v Speaker 1>milligrams,</v>

1109
00:51:46.330 --> 00:51:48.160
<v Speaker 1>it's doing a little bit of something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

1110
00:51:48.500 --> 00:51:50.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't just throw my nose up.</v>

1111
00:51:50.710 --> 00:51:53.560
<v Speaker 1>I mean you're not going to like live 30 </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent longer because of it,</v>

1112
00:51:53.980 --> 00:51:55.800
<v Speaker 1>because you drink wine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1113
00:51:55.810 --> 00:51:57.910
<v Speaker 1>but it's still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're still getting some,</v>

1114
00:51:58.060 --> 00:52:00.520
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's something to that.</v>

1115
00:52:00.880 --> 00:52:02.050
<v Speaker 1>There is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is something,</v>

1116
00:52:02.051 --> 00:52:02.670
<v Speaker 1>but it's not</v>

1117
00:52:02.730 --> 00:52:05.850
<v Speaker 2>grocery store.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was drinking a box of one.</v>

1118
00:52:05.880 --> 00:52:09.150
<v Speaker 2>He drank a box of wine at night,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which they think is like eight bottles.</v>

1119
00:52:09.660 --> 00:52:13.950
<v Speaker 1>How did he not like die of alcohol?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people have like a weird.</v>

1120
00:52:13.980 --> 00:52:18.980
<v Speaker 1>They have a variation in their gene </v>
<v Speaker 1>where they're able to actually convert </v>

1121
00:52:19.141 --> 00:52:22.140
<v Speaker 1>the alcohol to acetone and Acetate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is ketone.</v>

1122
00:52:22.620 --> 00:52:26.040
<v Speaker 1>So they actually get benefits from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really interesting.</v>

1123
00:52:26.480 --> 00:52:27.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

1124
00:52:27.680 --> 00:52:28.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1125
00:52:29.040 --> 00:52:34.040
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well clearly he's got something if you </v>

1126
00:52:34.040 --> 00:52:34.040
<v Speaker 1>can drink that much wine and not.</v>

1127
00:52:34.170 --> 00:52:37.440
<v Speaker 2>When he was telling us he was chocking </v>
<v Speaker 2>it off like it was no big deal and we're</v>

1128
00:52:37.441 --> 00:52:38.010
<v Speaker 2>all like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>

1129
00:52:38.011 --> 00:52:39.240
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck?</v>

1130
00:52:39.580 --> 00:52:42.540
<v Speaker 2>Like a whole box.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like even Brian was like a box,</v>

1131
00:52:43.530 --> 00:52:46.380
<v Speaker 2>a box,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a box of wine,</v>

1132
00:52:46.680 --> 00:52:49.590
<v Speaker 2>like a box of wine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's for like a large family gathering,</v>

1133
00:52:50.200 --> 00:52:51.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>alcohol in high,</v>

1134
00:52:51.970 --> 00:52:53.620
<v Speaker 1>high doses like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not good.</v>

1135
00:52:53.870 --> 00:52:58.870
<v Speaker 1>You can know it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to start killing neurons </v>

1136
00:52:58.870 --> 00:52:59.260
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not good.</v>

1137
00:52:59.261 --> 00:53:01.690
<v Speaker 1>You shouldn't do the binge where you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>taking so much of it.</v>

1138
00:53:01.691 --> 00:53:03.820
<v Speaker 1>But having a five ounce glass of wine </v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

1139
00:53:03.960 --> 00:53:08.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two milligrams and resveratrol may not </v>

1140
00:53:08.960 --> 00:53:08.960
<v Speaker 1>be as bad it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's probably probably</v>

1141
00:53:08.960 --> 00:53:13.680
<v Speaker 2>some health benefit as well to this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The mood altering shift of the relaxing,</v>

1142
00:53:13.870 --> 00:53:18.870
<v Speaker 2>of having a glass of wine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've always felt like that's something </v>

1143
00:53:18.870 --> 00:53:22.681
<v Speaker 2>that we shouldn't really look past.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like having a drink relaxes you and just</v>

1144
00:53:24.670 --> 00:53:28.290
<v Speaker 2>whatever negative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>negative impact that alcohol has on your</v>

1145
00:53:28.291 --> 00:53:33.291
<v Speaker 2>liver or the toxicity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't it kind of balanced out at least </v>

1146
00:53:33.291 --> 00:53:38.150
<v Speaker 2>on in low doses by the positive benefit </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you get from it being a social </v>

1147
00:53:38.251 --> 00:53:40.110
<v Speaker 2>lubricant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>relaxing you,</v>

1148
00:53:40.140 --> 00:53:41.040
<v Speaker 2>things along those lines.</v>

1149
00:53:41.300 --> 00:53:43.130
<v Speaker 1>It makes sense to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there,</v>

1150
00:53:43.131 --> 00:53:48.131
<v Speaker 1>there are so many different conflicting </v>
<v Speaker 1>studies out there with alcohol that's </v>

1151
00:53:48.131 --> 00:53:48.131
<v Speaker 1>good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's bad,</v>

1152
00:53:48.131 --> 00:53:48.140
<v Speaker 1>it's good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1153
00:53:48.141 --> 00:53:53.141
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think it has a lot to do with </v>

1154
00:53:53.141 --> 00:53:55.000
<v Speaker 1>genetics and just binge or what else are</v>
<v Speaker 1>you eating and just all these other </v>

1155
00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:55.000
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

1156
00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:56.420
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if someone drinks a glass of wine,</v>

1157
00:53:56.870 --> 00:53:58.520
<v Speaker 1>let's say they're like wound up all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

1158
00:53:58.521 --> 00:54:00.770
<v Speaker 1>It's like we were talking about before </v>
<v Speaker 1>the podcast,</v>

1159
00:54:00.771 --> 00:54:03.530
<v Speaker 1>but they're always like the lions coming</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get me,</v>

1160
00:54:03.531 --> 00:54:04.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

1161
00:54:04.730 --> 00:54:06.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lions coming to get me.</v>

1162
00:54:06.381 --> 00:54:09.680
<v Speaker 1>I gotta run.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I gotta fight off this beast.</v>

1163
00:54:09.710 --> 00:54:11.390
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's the stress response,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1164
00:54:11.391 --> 00:54:16.391
<v Speaker 1>That's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're activating your sympathetic </v>

1165
00:54:16.391 --> 00:54:16.391
<v Speaker 1>nervous system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

1166
00:54:16.391 --> 00:54:18.620
<v Speaker 1>which is good if you're actually out in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Africa and there's a line,</v>

1167
00:54:18.621 --> 00:54:22.290
<v Speaker 1>but if you're not having that active all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the time is actually it,</v>

1168
00:54:22.480 --> 00:54:27.480
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it prevents some of the feedback loops </v>

1169
00:54:27.480 --> 00:54:27.480
<v Speaker 1>that happen in your brain.</v>

1170
00:54:27.480 --> 00:54:28.640
<v Speaker 1>So when you have chronic stress like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1171
00:54:29.060 --> 00:54:32.310
<v Speaker 1>then you start to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you start to keep making it.</v>

1172
00:54:32.311 --> 00:54:34.070
<v Speaker 1>Usually when you're making,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you make stress hormone,</v>

1173
00:54:34.071 --> 00:54:34.730
<v Speaker 1>your body's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1174
00:54:34.731 --> 00:54:35.600
<v Speaker 1>I made this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's enough.</v>

1175
00:54:35.630 --> 00:54:39.260
<v Speaker 1>It shuts it off so that stuff that goes </v>
<v Speaker 1>away so you no longer shut it off and it</v>

1176
00:54:39.261 --> 00:54:44.261
<v Speaker 1>just keeps going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that can cause you to either be </v>

1177
00:54:44.261 --> 00:54:46.871
<v Speaker 1>super anxious where you're like lions </v>
<v Speaker 1>there all the time or the opposite end </v>

1178
00:54:46.871 --> 00:54:47.750
<v Speaker 1>of the spectrum where you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>totally,</v>

1179
00:54:49.270 --> 00:54:52.370
<v Speaker 1>you just don't care about anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1180
00:54:52.430 --> 00:54:54.110
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can be like depressed.</v>

1181
00:54:54.111 --> 00:54:56.210
<v Speaker 1>Where it's like nothing excites you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1182
00:54:56.630 --> 00:54:57.830
<v Speaker 1>you're just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're indifferent.</v>

1183
00:54:57.831 --> 00:55:02.831
<v Speaker 1>So having a glass of wine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that chills you out and you're not </v>

1184
00:55:02.831 --> 00:55:02.920
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1185
00:55:02.921 --> 00:55:04.610
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that seems like,</v>

1186
00:55:05.390 --> 00:55:06.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1187
00:55:06.441 --> 00:55:09.560
<v Speaker 1>if you're having a glass of wine to </v>
<v Speaker 1>chill out and yeah,</v>

1188
00:55:09.561 --> 00:55:14.561
<v Speaker 1>it seems like she'll announce good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but exercise would probably be a better </v>

1189
00:55:14.561 --> 00:55:14.561
<v Speaker 1>way to do it.</v>

1190
00:55:14.561 --> 00:55:14.561
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What about the,</v>

1191
00:55:14.580 --> 00:55:17.670
<v Speaker 2>is there any benefit to stressing your </v>
<v Speaker 2>body through alcohol?</v>

1192
00:55:17.671 --> 00:55:20.880
<v Speaker 2>Like as you were talking about these </v>
<v Speaker 2>pesticides that plants produce,</v>

1193
00:55:20.881 --> 00:55:21.720
<v Speaker 2>their stress,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your body,</v>

1194
00:55:21.721 --> 00:55:24.420
<v Speaker 2>you have this response from exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things along those lines.</v>

1195
00:55:24.600 --> 00:55:27.840
<v Speaker 2>Is there a risk?</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I was young I was really dumb.</v>

1196
00:55:28.050 --> 00:55:32.700
<v Speaker 2>I thought that smoking cigarettes might </v>
<v Speaker 2>have a good effect on your lungs because</v>

1197
00:55:32.701 --> 00:55:35.460
<v Speaker 2>it's like lifting way through your lungs</v>
<v Speaker 2>because your lungs would be like,</v>

1198
00:55:35.461 --> 00:55:37.500
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to process this stuff and it would</v>

1199
00:55:37.501 --> 00:55:39.060
<v Speaker 2>make your lungs stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1200
00:55:39.061 --> 00:55:44.061
<v Speaker 2>wasn't that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that was like what doctors </v>

1201
00:55:44.061 --> 00:55:44.061
<v Speaker 2>believed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1202
00:55:44.061 --> 00:55:45.450
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well at one point in time,</v>

1203
00:55:45.510 --> 00:55:48.720
<v Speaker 2>I mean I know that it was in that movie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the aviator,</v>

1204
00:55:48.870 --> 00:55:51.180
<v Speaker 2>the Leonardo Dicaprio moving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's good.</v>

1205
00:55:51.210 --> 00:55:51.440
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1206
00:55:51.441 --> 00:55:52.710
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not the one I'm thinking about.</v>

1207
00:55:52.711 --> 00:55:57.140
<v Speaker 2>I'm thinking of the one where he was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>can.</v>

1208
00:55:57.710 --> 00:55:58.710
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1209
00:55:59.220 --> 00:56:01.480
<v Speaker 2>no where he played.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1210
00:56:02.040 --> 00:56:07.040
<v Speaker 2>I'm the asshole that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that ran the FBI,</v>

1211
00:56:08.340 --> 00:56:10.790
<v Speaker 2>the guy who wore dresses over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1212
00:56:10.990 --> 00:56:13.740
<v Speaker 2>Your hoover when he played j Edgar </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hoover when he was young.</v>

1213
00:56:13.800 --> 00:56:15.480
<v Speaker 2>Only Rod Caprio,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1214
00:56:15.690 --> 00:56:18.750
<v Speaker 2>in the scene was with his mom and his </v>
<v Speaker 2>mom was telling him,</v>

1215
00:56:18.990 --> 00:56:23.990
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you're frail and you should listen </v>

1216
00:56:23.990 --> 00:56:23.990
<v Speaker 2>to the doctrine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>smoke cigarettes.</v>

1217
00:56:23.990 --> 00:56:24.010
<v Speaker 2>Like that was the thing</v>

1218
00:56:24.010 --> 00:56:29.010
<v Speaker 1>that they used to doctors prescribed </v>
<v Speaker 1>cigarettes to people to like increase </v>

1219
00:56:29.010 --> 00:56:29.600
<v Speaker 1>their vitality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1220
00:56:30.130 --> 00:56:31.060
<v Speaker 1>I don't know about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1221
00:56:31.090 --> 00:56:36.070
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what their explanation was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we'll do contain nicotine.</v>

1222
00:56:36.100 --> 00:56:36.910
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you want to,</v>

1223
00:56:36.940 --> 00:56:41.940
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to interrupt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there is one thing that absolutely </v>

1224
00:56:41.940 --> 00:56:44.311
<v Speaker 1>does happen from smoking cigarettes that</v>
<v Speaker 1>does benefit a certain population of </v>

1225
00:56:44.311 --> 00:56:46.240
<v Speaker 1>people because when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you put nicotine in your body,</v>

1226
00:56:46.670 --> 00:56:47.620
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1227
00:56:47.740 --> 00:56:51.190
<v Speaker 1>it totally normalizes something called </v>
<v Speaker 1>sensory gating,</v>

1228
00:56:51.460 --> 00:56:56.460
<v Speaker 1>which is what your brain does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your sensory gating is your brain </v>

1229
00:56:56.460 --> 00:57:00.570
<v Speaker 1>filtering out all this other information</v>
<v Speaker 1>information that's happening all the </v>

1230
00:57:00.570 --> 00:57:01.030
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like Jamie's sitting over there,</v>

1231
00:57:01.031 --> 00:57:01.960
<v Speaker 1>he's doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God knows what,</v>

1232
00:57:01.961 --> 00:57:06.961
<v Speaker 1>but I don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not paying attention because I'm </v>

1233
00:57:06.961 --> 00:57:06.961
<v Speaker 1>talking to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1234
00:57:06.961 --> 00:57:07.450
<v Speaker 1>there's noises out here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's smells,</v>

1235
00:57:07.451 --> 00:57:09.400
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's like your brain is able to focus</v>

1236
00:57:09.401 --> 00:57:13.210
<v Speaker 1>in and not like keep all these inputs </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming at once.</v>

1237
00:57:13.210 --> 00:57:15.550
<v Speaker 1>Well there are people that have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1238
00:57:15.580 --> 00:57:18.190
<v Speaker 1>problems in sensory gating and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>genetically related.</v>

1239
00:57:18.191 --> 00:57:19.990
<v Speaker 1>It's also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's certain dietary factors that can</v>

1240
00:57:19.991 --> 00:57:24.991
<v Speaker 1>play a role where they cannot do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they're getting all this input </v>

1241
00:57:24.991 --> 00:57:29.941
<v Speaker 1>all the time from everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if they like walk into a room with </v>

1242
00:57:29.941 --> 00:57:29.941
<v Speaker 1>like a bunch of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they flip out.</v>

1243
00:57:29.941 --> 00:57:34.501
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's just so they can hear all </v>

1244
00:57:34.501 --> 00:57:34.501
<v Speaker 1>the conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all coming in at once.</v>

1245
00:57:34.501 --> 00:57:38.490
<v Speaker 1>It's like sensory overload.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a cigarette can negate nicotine </v>

1246
00:57:38.490 --> 00:57:41.761
<v Speaker 1>negates it for 15 minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is why some people probably are </v>

1247
00:57:41.761 --> 00:57:41.761
<v Speaker 1>chronically smoking because after 15 </v>
<v Speaker 1>minutes,</v>

1248
00:57:41.761 --> 00:57:42.760
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they got to get that hit again.</v>

1249
00:57:42.761 --> 00:57:44.020
<v Speaker 1>Or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's coming.</v>

1250
00:57:44.470 --> 00:57:46.630
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people that are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1251
00:57:47.020 --> 00:57:49.180
<v Speaker 1>schizophrenia have a sensory gating </v>
<v Speaker 1>issue.</v>

1252
00:57:49.390 --> 00:57:51.300
<v Speaker 1>And so a lot of schizophrenia is </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually,</v>

1253
00:57:51.310 --> 00:57:52.540
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm,</v>

1254
00:57:52.720 --> 00:57:54.760
<v Speaker 1>this is me totally just throwing this </v>
<v Speaker 1>out there.</v>

1255
00:57:54.760 --> 00:57:56.760
<v Speaker 1>I think that's likely why a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>schizophrenia,</v>

1256
00:57:56.800 --> 00:57:59.350
<v Speaker 1>expert chainsmokers because they're self</v>
<v Speaker 1>medicating.</v>

1257
00:57:59.380 --> 00:58:00.670
<v Speaker 1>That makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I don't know,</v>

1258
00:58:00.671 --> 00:58:01.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

1259
00:58:01.540 --> 00:58:04.000
<v Speaker 1>that's my point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about nicotine though.</v>

1260
00:58:04.001 --> 00:58:05.920
<v Speaker 1>You're not talking about the actual act </v>
<v Speaker 1>of smoking.</v>

1261
00:58:06.670 --> 00:58:08.620
<v Speaker 1>Nicotine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could take that and other forums and</v>

1262
00:58:08.750 --> 00:58:13.750
<v Speaker 1>nicotine is prescribe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't prescribed a certain heart </v>

1263
00:58:13.750 --> 00:58:16.591
<v Speaker 1>patients.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he doesn't have some sort of a </v>

1264
00:58:16.591 --> 00:58:16.591
<v Speaker 1>benefit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know the heart function.</v>

1265
00:58:16.591 --> 00:58:17.230
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like it does.</v>

1266
00:58:17.290 --> 00:58:20.890
<v Speaker 1>I feel like there's some sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>medicinal benefit to nicotine itself.</v>

1267
00:58:20.891 --> 00:58:25.891
<v Speaker 1>Obviously not in a cigarette for him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See if he could find that health </v>

1268
00:58:25.891 --> 00:58:27.110
<v Speaker 1>benefits of nicotine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1269
00:58:27.890 --> 00:58:31.210
<v Speaker 1>But Mike dumb idea was that it was like </v>
<v Speaker 1>it would stress out your lungs,</v>

1270
00:58:31.211 --> 00:58:32.980
<v Speaker 1>it would make your lungs stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Definitely stress them out.</v>

1271
00:58:33.700 --> 00:58:36.160
<v Speaker 1>But is there any benefit like that with </v>
<v Speaker 1>alcohol?</v>

1272
00:58:36.161 --> 00:58:39.580
<v Speaker 1>Like is there any like stressing out </v>
<v Speaker 1>your body from drinking?</v>

1273
00:58:39.610 --> 00:58:43.540
<v Speaker 1>Is there any robustness that would be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>side effect of that.</v>

1274
00:58:44.080 --> 00:58:48.280
<v Speaker 1>So here's the thing with anything that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hormetic,</v>

1275
00:58:48.490 --> 00:58:53.050
<v Speaker 1>so anything that is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dose is very important.</v>

1276
00:58:53.410 --> 00:58:58.410
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you have something that is </v>

1277
00:58:58.410 --> 00:58:58.410
<v Speaker 1>stressful on the body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you were to be running,</v>

1278
00:58:58.410 --> 00:58:59.830
<v Speaker 1>if you were to run all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all day,</v>

1279
00:58:59.831 --> 00:59:01.210
<v Speaker 1>every day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you didn't recover,</v>

1280
00:59:01.570 --> 00:59:03.000
<v Speaker 1>you die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1281
00:59:03.060 --> 00:59:08.060
<v Speaker 1>if you're a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you were to sit in the sauna or a </v>

1282
00:59:08.060 --> 00:59:10.021
<v Speaker 1>cold or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if you were to take like two </v>

1283
00:59:10.021 --> 00:59:11.220
<v Speaker 1>kilograms of Bok Choy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1284
00:59:11.230 --> 00:59:13.060
<v Speaker 1>you'd have some problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's too much.</v>

1285
00:59:13.300 --> 00:59:16.330
<v Speaker 1>The things that are hormetic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two kilograms of Bok Choy would fuck you</v>

1286
00:59:16.331 --> 00:59:18.560
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's like woman pounds of Bok Choy,</v>

1287
00:59:18.950 --> 00:59:21.920
<v Speaker 1>two kilograms is kilograms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a lot of</v>

1288
00:59:21.980 --> 00:59:23.090
<v Speaker 2>Bok Choy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1289
00:59:23.091 --> 00:59:24.620
<v Speaker 2>What does that look like?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That a lot?</v>

1290
00:59:25.240 --> 00:59:28.400
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a kilogram is one point two pounds.</v>

1291
00:59:28.430 --> 00:59:30.640
<v Speaker 2>Is that what it is?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1292
00:59:30.650 --> 00:59:31.670
<v Speaker 2>Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good goal.</v>

1293
00:59:32.030 --> 00:59:33.690
<v Speaker 2>I think it's one point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Two pounds.</v>

1294
00:59:33.860 --> 00:59:36.590
<v Speaker 2>It sounds familiar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So two kilograms,</v>

1295
00:59:36.980 --> 00:59:41.980
<v Speaker 2>two kilograms says it's about a box box,</v>
<v Speaker 2>box box box of what?</v>

1296
00:59:43.060 --> 00:59:44.330
<v Speaker 2>Above?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like a big box.</v>

1297
00:59:44.331 --> 00:59:45.350
<v Speaker 2>I started looking at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's a,</v>

1298
00:59:45.440 --> 00:59:50.440
<v Speaker 2>that's not a real measurement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what a box to box you in </v>

1299
00:59:50.440 --> 00:59:52.460
<v Speaker 2>this room that doesn't make any sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what does a kilogram.</v>

1300
00:59:52.461 --> 00:59:54.320
<v Speaker 2>A kilogram is one point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two pounds,</v>

1301
00:59:54.321 --> 00:59:56.330
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or two point two pounds.</v>

1302
00:59:56.410 --> 00:59:58.720
<v Speaker 2>Is it two point two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two point two,</v>

1303
01:00:00.080 --> 01:00:03.680
<v Speaker 2>two point two pounds per.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So four kilograms.</v>

1304
01:00:03.980 --> 01:00:07.640
<v Speaker 2>Eight point was at a point eight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nine pounds of Bok Choy.</v>

1305
01:00:07.780 --> 01:00:09.860
<v Speaker 2>What is just google that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does that look like?</v>

1306
01:00:09.950 --> 01:00:14.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Google four kilograms kilograms to </v>

1307
01:00:14.950 --> 01:00:18.191
<v Speaker 2>pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>four kilograms or pounds people in </v>

1308
01:00:18.191 --> 01:00:18.191
<v Speaker 2>Europe.</v>

1309
01:00:18.191 --> 01:00:19.390
<v Speaker 1>You fucking idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't even know the metric system.</v>

1310
01:00:19.900 --> 01:00:21.550
<v Speaker 1>You don't even know what the rest of </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

1311
01:00:21.551 --> 01:00:26.551
<v Speaker 1>You know what this is my response.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that Google for things like that?</v>

1312
01:00:27.380 --> 01:00:32.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to get even with my stupid </v>

1313
01:00:32.380 --> 01:00:32.980
<v Speaker 1>brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that will kill you.</v>

1314
01:00:33.380 --> 01:00:38.380
<v Speaker 1>I'll kill you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it might give you greater goiter </v>

1315
01:00:38.380 --> 01:00:38.520
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it because,</v>

1316
01:00:38.530 --> 01:00:39.550
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does goiter?</v>

1317
01:00:39.910 --> 01:00:42.900
<v Speaker 1>It could basically cause hyperthyroid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

1318
01:00:43.110 --> 01:00:43.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

1319
01:00:43.931 --> 01:00:45.310
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

1320
01:00:45.340 --> 01:00:49.180
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing about the isothiocyanates,</v>

1321
01:00:49.181 --> 01:00:51.850
<v Speaker 1>which are in Bok Choy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that they're anticancer.</v>

1322
01:00:52.060 --> 01:00:53.380
<v Speaker 1>They're good when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're getting,</v>

1323
01:00:53.381 --> 01:00:56.950
<v Speaker 1>when you're eating your Kale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm talking to kilograms again,</v>

1324
01:00:57.100 --> 01:00:58.510
<v Speaker 1>it took two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a lot.</v>

1325
01:00:58.600 --> 01:00:59.810
<v Speaker 1>Massive amount,</v>
<v Speaker 1>massive.</v>

1326
01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:04.920
<v Speaker 1>Nobody in their right mind would ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>eat that much kale or Broccoli or </v>

1327
01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:05.530
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bok Choy a day.</v>

1328
01:01:06.040 --> 01:01:07.870
<v Speaker 1>But if you did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing is,</v>

1329
01:01:07.871 --> 01:01:12.871
<v Speaker 1>is that isothiocyanates can compete with</v>
<v Speaker 1>iodine transport into the thyroid.</v>

1330
01:01:13.390 --> 01:01:16.480
<v Speaker 1>And so if all you're eating all day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyday is Bok Choy,</v>

1331
01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:17.990
<v Speaker 1>guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your iodine.</v>

1332
01:01:17.991 --> 01:01:19.360
<v Speaker 1>It's not going to be getting into your </v>
<v Speaker 1>thyroid.</v>

1333
01:01:19.361 --> 01:01:20.910
<v Speaker 1>And so you could have some thyroid </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems,</v>

1334
01:01:20.940 --> 01:01:21.540
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you need,</v>

1335
01:01:21.550 --> 01:01:23.950
<v Speaker 1>that's just overwhelming the amount.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is,</v>

1336
01:01:23.951 --> 01:01:26.950
<v Speaker 1>and this is with anything hormetic I am </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to answer your question,</v>

1337
01:01:26.951 --> 01:01:31.951
<v Speaker 1>but the point that I'm trying to make is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that a lot of these compounds that are </v>

1338
01:01:32.231 --> 01:01:35.500
<v Speaker 1>hormetic fasting exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1339
01:01:35.501 --> 01:01:37.150
<v Speaker 1>doing cold stress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>heat stress,</v>

1340
01:01:37.480 --> 01:01:41.740
<v Speaker 1>these plant insecticides you need the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the key is the dose.</v>

1341
01:01:41.950 --> 01:01:44.350
<v Speaker 1>So like you don't want to over it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to have a huge,</v>

1342
01:01:44.351 --> 01:01:45.710
<v Speaker 1>huge dose of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

1343
01:01:45.711 --> 01:01:48.190
<v Speaker 1>And with the plants it's really hard to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get a huge dose.</v>

1344
01:01:48.191 --> 01:01:49.480
<v Speaker 1>But with exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1345
01:01:50.290 --> 01:01:55.290
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure that running 50 miles is </v>

1346
01:01:55.290 --> 01:01:55.290
<v Speaker 1>actually that good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty,</v>

1347
01:01:55.290 --> 01:01:55.930
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty stressful.</v>

1348
01:01:55.980 --> 01:01:56.580
<v Speaker 1>It's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1349
01:01:56.590 --> 01:01:58.200
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get the point.</v>

1350
01:01:58.210 --> 01:02:03.210
<v Speaker 1>But with alcohol it has been shown that </v>
<v Speaker 1>in small doses it can have a slight </v>

1351
01:02:04.601 --> 01:02:08.020
<v Speaker 1>hormetic effect in small doses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it depends.</v>

1352
01:02:08.050 --> 01:02:13.050
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if these studies have been </v>

1353
01:02:13.050 --> 01:02:13.050
<v Speaker 1>done in humans yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like probably like,</v>

1354
01:02:13.050 --> 01:02:13.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>

1355
01:02:13.050 --> 01:02:16.940
<v Speaker 1>like a small glass of wine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is a slightly hormetic effect now.</v>

1356
01:02:17.020 --> 01:02:21.030
<v Speaker 1>Now keep in mind there are other things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that can regulate that,</v>

1357
01:02:21.031 --> 01:02:22.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are different.</v>

1358
01:02:22.891 --> 01:02:25.470
<v Speaker 1>We all have different genes and so for </v>
<v Speaker 1>example,</v>

1359
01:02:26.040 --> 01:02:31.040
<v Speaker 1>I cannot recover from a large dose of </v>
<v Speaker 1>alcohol like Dan Ken because my,</v>

1360
01:02:33.270 --> 01:02:38.270
<v Speaker 1>I have a certain gene variation and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>gene that does not repair damage from </v>

1361
01:02:38.270 --> 01:02:40.040
<v Speaker 1>two neurons very well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1362
01:02:40.050 --> 01:02:42.090
<v Speaker 1>so there are other things to keep in </v>
<v Speaker 1>mind,</v>

1363
01:02:42.091 --> 01:02:45.210
<v Speaker 1>but yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that has been shown in small doses,</v>

1364
01:02:45.420 --> 01:02:50.420
<v Speaker 1>at least in animal models like flies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more arms that small dose of alcohol can</v>

1365
01:02:50.641 --> 01:02:55.641
<v Speaker 1>actually have a hormetic effect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's with any class to actually </v>

1366
01:02:55.641 --> 01:02:57.220
<v Speaker 1>define a chemical compound as hormetic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

1367
01:02:57.240 --> 01:02:58.410
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the in science,</v>

1368
01:02:58.420 --> 01:03:01.330
<v Speaker 1>the definition is like there's this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a u shaped curve,</v>

1369
01:03:01.770 --> 01:03:06.240
<v Speaker 1>so when you have just enough of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get a positive effect,</v>

1370
01:03:06.241 --> 01:03:11.241
<v Speaker 1>but when you go over that threshold you </v>
<v Speaker 1>start to have a negative effect and </v>

1371
01:03:11.241 --> 01:03:11.700
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's with,</v>

1372
01:03:11.750 --> 01:03:14.580
<v Speaker 1>that's what stress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we're talking about good stress,</v>

1373
01:03:14.581 --> 01:03:19.581
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not talking about exercising all </v>

1374
01:03:19.581 --> 01:03:19.581
<v Speaker 1>day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every day.</v>

1375
01:03:19.581 --> 01:03:19.740
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about exercising,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1376
01:03:19.770 --> 01:03:20.520
<v Speaker 1>getting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1377
01:03:20.610 --> 01:03:22.320
<v Speaker 1>pushing past and in getting some of that</v>

1378
01:03:23.150 --> 01:03:28.150
<v Speaker 2>huge issue with martial artists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the fighters because they always </v>

1379
01:03:28.150 --> 01:03:31.121
<v Speaker 2>feel like if they do more they will have</v>
<v Speaker 2>more endurance and there'll be able to </v>

1380
01:03:31.121 --> 01:03:35.741
<v Speaker 2>perform better inside the octagon or </v>
<v Speaker 2>inside the ring or whatever they're </v>

1381
01:03:35.840 --> 01:03:38.390
<v Speaker 2>wrestling mat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever the competing on and it becomes</v>

1382
01:03:38.391 --> 01:03:43.391
<v Speaker 2>a real issue with people because </v>
<v Speaker 2>overtraining is a giant factor in </v>

1383
01:03:43.391 --> 01:03:47.711
<v Speaker 2>preparation because they get to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>point where the body can't recover from </v>

1384
01:03:47.711 --> 01:03:49.170
<v Speaker 2>the work that it's done and their mind </v>
<v Speaker 2>and their,</v>

1385
01:03:49.220 --> 01:03:54.220
<v Speaker 2>their actual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their mental toughness and their </v>

1386
01:03:54.220 --> 01:03:54.220
<v Speaker 2>discipline has actually ruined them </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they've,</v>

1387
01:03:54.220 --> 01:03:56.420
<v Speaker 2>they've gone too far.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They started getting chronic injuries to</v>

1388
01:03:56.421 --> 01:03:59.390
<v Speaker 2>big issue right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's that tipping point we have to</v>

1389
01:03:59.391 --> 01:04:04.391
<v Speaker 2>realize like what is the right amount of</v>
<v Speaker 2>work for and the right amount of </v>

1390
01:04:04.391 --> 01:04:07.190
<v Speaker 2>recovery versus people who they feel </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1391
01:04:07.191 --> 01:04:09.440
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you just push yourself further,</v>

1392
01:04:09.441 --> 01:04:11.420
<v Speaker 2>your body will respond.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you put.</v>

1393
01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:16.440
<v Speaker 2>There's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of people that have had </v>

1394
01:04:16.440 --> 01:04:16.440
<v Speaker 2>that attitude that if you can just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'll be hard.</v>

1395
01:04:16.440 --> 01:04:16.940
<v Speaker 2>You might feel overtrained the </v>
<v Speaker 2>beginning,</v>

1396
01:04:16.941 --> 01:04:18.530
<v Speaker 2>but your body will compensate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You.</v>

1397
01:04:18.531 --> 01:04:21.980
<v Speaker 2>Body will eventually upregulate and get </v>
<v Speaker 2>ready.</v>

1398
01:04:22.040 --> 01:04:24.350
<v Speaker 2>Get ready for this increased workload.</v>

1399
01:04:24.580 --> 01:04:25.710
<v Speaker 1>The manning on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1400
01:04:25.830 --> 01:04:26.810
<v Speaker 1>prepare for war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1401
01:04:26.811 --> 01:04:28.180
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's some truth to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1402
01:04:28.460 --> 01:04:30.650
<v Speaker 1>you do want to push yourself and your </v>
<v Speaker 1>body will,</v>

1403
01:04:30.920 --> 01:04:35.270
<v Speaker 1>you will have a strong stress response,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you have to recover.</v>

1404
01:04:35.450 --> 01:04:36.650
<v Speaker 1>You can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't,</v>

1405
01:04:36.710 --> 01:04:37.660
<v Speaker 1>you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you.</v>

1406
01:04:37.900 --> 01:04:40.580
<v Speaker 1>The dose is very important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you push yourself beyond,</v>

1407
01:04:41.350 --> 01:04:44.390
<v Speaker 1>it's just like you're not going to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>a recovery period,</v>

1408
01:04:44.420 --> 01:04:46.340
<v Speaker 1>like you're not going to be able to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it</v>

1409
01:04:46.510 --> 01:04:51.040
<v Speaker 2>important than to build your base over a</v>
<v Speaker 2>long period of time then?</v>

1410
01:04:51.070 --> 01:04:56.070
<v Speaker 2>Because you would build your endurance </v>
<v Speaker 2>slowly where you slowly increase the </v>

1411
01:04:56.070 --> 01:05:00.121
<v Speaker 2>base.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You make sure that your recovery is </v>

1412
01:05:00.121 --> 01:05:02.311
<v Speaker 2>consistent and then just keep doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>monitoring it over a long period of </v>

1413
01:05:02.311 --> 01:05:03.760
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then once you have a very high base,</v>

1414
01:05:03.790 --> 01:05:06.100
<v Speaker 2>then really ramp it up and then go </v>
<v Speaker 2>through like a</v>

1415
01:05:06.650 --> 01:05:08.000
<v Speaker 1>training camp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That makes sense.</v>

1416
01:05:08.300 --> 01:05:09.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody does that though.</v>

1417
01:05:10.160 --> 01:05:11.150
<v Speaker 1>That makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1418
01:05:11.151 --> 01:05:12.350
<v Speaker 1>that would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that makes logical,</v>

1419
01:05:12.351 --> 01:05:14.120
<v Speaker 1>that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1420
01:05:14.121 --> 01:05:14.630
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1421
01:05:14.700 --> 01:05:16.460
<v Speaker 1>and even for some of these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these uh,</v>

1422
01:05:16.640 --> 01:05:17.520
<v Speaker 1>plant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1423
01:05:17.560 --> 01:05:20.320
<v Speaker 1>compounds to like in that Rivera trial </v>
<v Speaker 1>setting,</v>

1424
01:05:20.321 --> 01:05:25.321
<v Speaker 1>the monkeys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first year those monkeys were </v>

1425
01:05:25.321 --> 01:05:28.441
<v Speaker 1>actually given us a smaller dose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're giving 80 milligrams for the </v>

1426
01:05:28.441 --> 01:05:28.441
<v Speaker 1>first year and the second year they were</v>
<v Speaker 1>given $400.</v>

1427
01:05:28.540 --> 01:05:29.770
<v Speaker 1>Very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1428
01:05:29.800 --> 01:05:32.180
<v Speaker 1>They started and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and back to your resveratrol.</v>

1429
01:05:32.430 --> 01:05:35.080
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like I have to.</v>

1430
01:05:35.110 --> 01:05:40.110
<v Speaker 1>There's so many compounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's so many brands out there that </v>

1431
01:05:40.110 --> 01:05:40.430
<v Speaker 1>are just utter crap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have like filler and you know,</v>

1432
01:05:40.500 --> 01:05:42.460
<v Speaker 1>you think you're getting Akinesia but </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not,</v>

1433
01:05:42.461 --> 01:05:47.461
<v Speaker 1>you're getting some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some kind of magnesium steroids or </v>

1434
01:05:47.461 --> 01:05:47.461
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm,</v>

1435
01:05:47.461 --> 01:05:48.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm interested in the,</v>

1436
01:05:48.511 --> 01:05:53.511
<v Speaker 1>is virtual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm interested in a lot of these other </v>

1437
01:05:53.511 --> 01:05:53.511
<v Speaker 1>plant compounds.</v>

1438
01:05:53.511 --> 01:05:55.830
<v Speaker 1>I like to get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the reasons why I like to </v>

1439
01:05:55.830 --> 01:05:55.830
<v Speaker 1>eat a wide variety of plants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1440
01:05:55.830 --> 01:05:56.350
<v Speaker 1>celery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Parsley,</v>

1441
01:05:56.650 --> 01:05:57.430
<v Speaker 1>you know there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1442
01:05:57.431 --> 01:06:00.090
<v Speaker 1>there's stuff in like apple peels and in</v>
<v Speaker 1>green tomatoes,</v>

1443
01:06:00.091 --> 01:06:03.970
<v Speaker 1>so ursolic acid in apple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>skin and tomato dean and green tomatoes.</v>

1444
01:06:04.300 --> 01:06:07.780
<v Speaker 1>They actually inhibited gene in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>skeletal muscle called atf four.</v>

1445
01:06:08.080 --> 01:06:13.080
<v Speaker 1>That gene actually starts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It prevents protein synthesis from </v>

1446
01:06:13.080 --> 01:06:14.380
<v Speaker 1>happening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it stops your muscle cells for making</v>

1447
01:06:14.381 --> 01:06:19.381
<v Speaker 1>proteins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So inhibiting that means more protein </v>

1448
01:06:19.381 --> 01:06:20.170
<v Speaker 1>synthesis and that's been shown in mice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if they're giving really high dose,</v>

1449
01:06:20.171 --> 01:06:25.171
<v Speaker 1>like point two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven percent are solocasts and point </v>

1450
01:06:25.171 --> 01:06:27.441
<v Speaker 1>zero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five percent tomatoes and they can grow </v>

1451
01:06:27.441 --> 01:06:27.441
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>increase our muscle growth by 30 percent</v>

1452
01:06:27.441 --> 01:06:29.530
<v Speaker 1>over what they would do if they didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>have it.</v>

1453
01:06:29.560 --> 01:06:30.580
<v Speaker 1>That's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1454
01:06:31.070 --> 01:06:34.140
<v Speaker 1>but they were giving them a huge dose </v>
<v Speaker 1>still.</v>

1455
01:06:34.150 --> 01:06:35.290
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>

1456
01:06:35.320 --> 01:06:37.120
<v Speaker 1>Thirty percent is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>

1457
01:06:37.480 --> 01:06:38.660
<v Speaker 1>Steroids can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1458
01:06:38.920 --> 01:06:41.720
<v Speaker 1>Well there's these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are now out in the market as,</v>

1459
01:06:41.880 --> 01:06:43.330
<v Speaker 1>as far,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1460
01:06:43.430 --> 01:06:46.360
<v Speaker 1>foreign nutraceuticals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess you'd call them muscle builders.</v>

1461
01:06:46.560 --> 01:06:47.690
<v Speaker 1>They're all into it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>

1462
01:06:47.720 --> 01:06:48.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can eat.</v>

1463
01:06:48.850 --> 01:06:50.530
<v Speaker 1>I like to eat apples.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like to,</v>

1464
01:06:50.650 --> 01:06:52.110
<v Speaker 1>I like to make,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1465
01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:53.770
<v Speaker 1>actually I don't make it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I buy it already made,</v>

1466
01:06:53.771 --> 01:06:57.100
<v Speaker 1>but it's to tomatillo sauce.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever tried that?</v>

1467
01:06:57.330 --> 01:07:02.050
<v Speaker 1>It's really good on eggs and put them on</v>
<v Speaker 1>eggs and every time I'm drunk I'm eating</v>

1468
01:07:02.051 --> 01:07:02.380
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1469
01:07:02.381 --> 01:07:03.250
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>missiles,</v>

1470
01:07:03.550 --> 01:07:05.110
<v Speaker 1>muscles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How bizarre.</v>

1471
01:07:05.560 --> 01:07:10.560
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is rose virtual something you should </v>

1472
01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:10.560
<v Speaker 1>take with food?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Empty stomach.</v>

1473
01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:11.300
<v Speaker 1>How should you take that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1474
01:07:11.560 --> 01:07:15.010
<v Speaker 1>because I've been so skeptical of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>field for so long,</v>

1475
01:07:15.011 --> 01:07:17.140
<v Speaker 1>I've not supplemented with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1476
01:07:17.141 --> 01:07:18.900
<v Speaker 1>I did for a little while.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1477
01:07:19.360 --> 01:07:22.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking back into it just because </v>
<v Speaker 1>now I'm interested.</v>

1478
01:07:22.300 --> 01:07:23.730
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm very interested.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1479
01:07:23.740 --> 01:07:24.790
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

1480
01:07:24.880 --> 01:07:26.850
<v Speaker 1>there's also someone pointed out to me </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I,</v>

1481
01:07:26.910 --> 01:07:31.910
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did a post on this and they said that </v>

1482
01:07:31.910 --> 01:07:33.841
<v Speaker 1>was vera trawl was shown to negate some </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the high intensity interval training </v>

1483
01:07:36.130 --> 01:07:37.900
<v Speaker 1>gains or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't read the study.</v>

1484
01:07:37.901 --> 01:07:39.530
<v Speaker 1>I don't know exactly what that means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm.</v>

1485
01:07:39.580 --> 01:07:44.580
<v Speaker 1>Brisbane all has been shown to actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>cause a mitochondrial biogenesis and </v>

1486
01:07:45.610 --> 01:07:48.970
<v Speaker 1>shift muscle fibers to type one which </v>
<v Speaker 1>are more endurance.</v>

1487
01:07:49.330 --> 01:07:51.910
<v Speaker 1>The thing is that Raspberry Charles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not like an antioxidant,</v>

1488
01:07:51.911 --> 01:07:56.911
<v Speaker 1>it's not like taking vitamin E,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the difference between taking an </v>

1489
01:07:56.911 --> 01:07:58.600
<v Speaker 1>antioxidant or to even taking like </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ibuprofen,</v>

1490
01:07:58.630 --> 01:08:03.630
<v Speaker 1>like if you do these studies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>studies have been done where they've </v>

1491
01:08:03.630 --> 01:08:05.100
<v Speaker 1>shown that taking like Ibuprofen or </v>
<v Speaker 1>taking supplemental vitamin A,</v>

1492
01:08:05.340 --> 01:08:10.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after a workout or while you're working </v>

1493
01:08:10.340 --> 01:08:10.450
<v Speaker 1>out can blend some of the positive </v>
<v Speaker 1>benefits from it.</v>

1494
01:08:10.870 --> 01:08:14.320
<v Speaker 1>And the reason is because when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>exercise you are,</v>

1495
01:08:14.490 --> 01:08:16.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're causing stress.</v>

1496
01:08:16.110 --> 01:08:21.110
<v Speaker 1>Like we were talked about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>talked about you're causing </v>

1497
01:08:21.110 --> 01:08:21.110
<v Speaker 1>inflammation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're causing,</v>

1498
01:08:21.110 --> 01:08:23.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reactive oxygen species to form and this</v>

1499
01:08:23.990 --> 01:08:26.240
<v Speaker 1>is very important for the stress </v>
<v Speaker 1>response.</v>

1500
01:08:26.241 --> 01:08:28.130
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why you have a positive effect.</v>

1501
01:08:28.370 --> 01:08:30.080
<v Speaker 1>But if you're taking something like </v>
<v Speaker 1>vitamin D,</v>

1502
01:08:30.081 --> 01:08:34.320
<v Speaker 1>vitamin e actually like it's like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sponge it like goes around and stuff and</v>

1503
01:08:34.330 --> 01:08:34.700
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1504
01:08:35.030 --> 01:08:38.300
<v Speaker 1>here's a reactive oxygen species or an </v>
<v Speaker 1>inflammatory that just stops.</v>

1505
01:08:38.301 --> 01:08:41.660
<v Speaker 1>It sucks it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And ensades,</v>

1506
01:08:41.830 --> 01:08:42.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1507
01:08:42.530 --> 01:08:47.530
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they stopped the inflammatory mediators </v>

1508
01:08:47.530 --> 01:08:47.730
<v Speaker 1>from being produced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>revere,</v>

1509
01:08:47.760 --> 01:08:49.370
<v Speaker 1>trawl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>curcumin,</v>

1510
01:08:49.400 --> 01:08:50.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these plant insecticides,</v>

1511
01:08:51.350 --> 01:08:56.350
<v Speaker 1>they don't work that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They actually are stressful themselves </v>

1512
01:08:56.350 --> 01:08:58.190
<v Speaker 1>and so they activate these anti </v>
<v Speaker 1>inflammatory genes,</v>

1513
01:08:58.191 --> 01:09:00.020
<v Speaker 1>antioxidant genes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all this good stuff.</v>

1514
01:09:00.320 --> 01:09:02.090
<v Speaker 1>So it's a very different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1515
01:09:02.091 --> 01:09:04.900
<v Speaker 1>then then taking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1516
01:09:05.560 --> 01:09:10.560
<v Speaker 1>an and an antioxidant or an anti </v>
<v Speaker 1>inflammatory and implement those nsaids </v>

1517
01:09:10.560 --> 01:09:12.350
<v Speaker 1>or they're not really good news in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>opinion,</v>

1518
01:09:12.800 --> 01:09:17.800
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've been shown to increase heart </v>

1519
01:09:17.800 --> 01:09:20.631
<v Speaker 1>attack,</v>
<v Speaker 1>heart attack and has been shown and say </v>

1520
01:09:20.631 --> 01:09:20.631
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>

1521
01:09:20.631 --> 01:09:22.870
<v Speaker 1>And so if there's an FDA warning label </v>
<v Speaker 1>on every Ibuprofen bottle and all that,</v>

1522
01:09:22.910 --> 01:09:25.190
<v Speaker 1>you can buy in the market.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's bad for you.</v>

1523
01:09:25.610 --> 01:09:26.680
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1524
01:09:26.730 --> 01:09:28.310
<v Speaker 1>it's nonsteroidal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anti inflammatory,</v>

1525
01:09:28.311 --> 01:09:29.930
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1526
01:09:30.210 --> 01:09:31.580
<v Speaker 1>it's Ibuprofen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1527
01:09:31.820 --> 01:09:33.500
<v Speaker 1>The thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing with some of these,</v>

1528
01:09:33.800 --> 01:09:36.740
<v Speaker 1>it depends on the type of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of um,</v>

1529
01:09:36.840 --> 01:09:38.270
<v Speaker 1>and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but with,</v>

1530
01:09:38.330 --> 01:09:42.290
<v Speaker 1>with Ibuprofen and other ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So ibuprofen targets.</v>

1531
01:09:42.590 --> 01:09:47.590
<v Speaker 1>The way it's an antiinflammatory is it </v>
<v Speaker 1>targets one of these enzymes called Cox </v>

1532
01:09:47.590 --> 01:09:51.710
<v Speaker 1>two and it stops Cox two makes inflammed</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes leukotrienes,</v>

1533
01:09:52.101 --> 01:09:55.520
<v Speaker 1>and excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trump thromboxanes,</v>

1534
01:09:55.700 --> 01:09:58.640
<v Speaker 1>which caused platelets to aggregate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They also cause inflammation.</v>

1535
01:09:58.850 --> 01:10:01.310
<v Speaker 1>It makes this other chemical that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>involved in pain.</v>

1536
01:10:01.670 --> 01:10:04.280
<v Speaker 1>So when you stop that enzyme from doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1537
01:10:04.610 --> 01:10:06.200
<v Speaker 1>then you're going to have less </v>
<v Speaker 1>inflammation.</v>

1538
01:10:06.201 --> 01:10:08.300
<v Speaker 1>You're going to have an inflammation </v>
<v Speaker 1>causes pain,</v>

1539
01:10:08.360 --> 01:10:09.230
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1540
01:10:09.370 --> 01:10:14.370
<v Speaker 1>so you're going to have an anti pain </v>
<v Speaker 1>believing that you're going to have a </v>

1541
01:10:14.370 --> 01:10:14.370
<v Speaker 1>pain relieving effect.</v>

1542
01:10:14.370 --> 01:10:16.790
<v Speaker 1>The problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that when you inhibit,</v>

1543
01:10:16.791 --> 01:10:21.791
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we get back to biology and feedback </v>

1544
01:10:21.791 --> 01:10:21.791
<v Speaker 1>loops and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our,</v>

1545
01:10:21.791 --> 01:10:22.250
<v Speaker 1>our biology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've,</v>

1546
01:10:22.760 --> 01:10:26.090
<v Speaker 1>even though this enzyme,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cox two causes inflammation,</v>

1547
01:10:26.840 --> 01:10:29.870
<v Speaker 1>it's also an anti inflammatory at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same time,</v>

1548
01:10:30.080 --> 01:10:33.770
<v Speaker 1>Cox to also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's important for making sure platelets</v>

1549
01:10:33.771 --> 01:10:38.090
<v Speaker 1>don't aggregate too much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So at the same time it's doing something</v>

1550
01:10:38.091 --> 01:10:39.350
<v Speaker 1>that's making them migrate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also like,</v>

1551
01:10:39.351 --> 01:10:44.351
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's keep this in check and let's make </v>

1552
01:10:44.351 --> 01:10:44.351
<v Speaker 1>sure it doesn't go overboard and it also</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes something else,</v>

1553
01:10:44.351 --> 01:10:46.310
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's important for relaxing,</v>

1554
01:10:46.311 --> 01:10:51.311
<v Speaker 1>smooth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>smooth the smooth muscle cells in your </v>

1555
01:10:51.311 --> 01:10:51.330
<v Speaker 1>blood vessels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1556
01:10:51.410 --> 01:10:56.410
<v Speaker 1>and also it releases nitric oxide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you spoke that enzyme to </v>

1557
01:10:56.410 --> 01:10:58.400
<v Speaker 1>blocking the inflammation and pain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then the,</v>

1558
01:10:58.401 --> 01:11:01.340
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the smooth muscle cells become stiff and</v>

1559
01:11:01.341 --> 01:11:02.720
<v Speaker 1>you make less nitrogen oxide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1560
01:11:03.350 --> 01:11:05.240
<v Speaker 1>which is important to relax the blood </v>
<v Speaker 1>vessels.</v>

1561
01:11:05.510 --> 01:11:06.770
<v Speaker 1>And that can be bad.</v>

1562
01:11:06.770 --> 01:11:11.150
<v Speaker 1>If you are a stiffening your vessels a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot and you have plaques,</v>

1563
01:11:11.151 --> 01:11:12.210
<v Speaker 1>the plaques can then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1564
01:11:12.230 --> 01:11:17.230
<v Speaker 1>kind of come off and get clogged and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a friend who takes that shit every </v>

1565
01:11:17.230 --> 01:11:17.340
<v Speaker 1>morning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'd runs a lot,</v>

1566
01:11:17.520 --> 01:11:22.520
<v Speaker 1>he runs a lot and he takes it every </v>
<v Speaker 1>morning and he'll take it before he </v>

1567
01:11:22.520 --> 01:11:23.190
<v Speaker 1>runs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he probably,</v>

1568
01:11:23.250 --> 01:11:24.120
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not.</v>

1569
01:11:24.240 --> 01:11:29.240
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll send you this study where at </v>

1570
01:11:29.240 --> 01:11:29.310
<v Speaker 1>blended the gains from exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it really is new.</v>

1571
01:11:29.311 --> 01:11:32.070
<v Speaker 1>Cameron hanes get off that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean women.</v>

1572
01:11:32.250 --> 01:11:37.250
<v Speaker 1>So there was like eight different </v>
<v Speaker 1>clinical trials that were done and this </v>

1573
01:11:37.250 --> 01:11:41.721
<v Speaker 1>is what made the FDA put a warning label</v>
<v Speaker 1>on all ibuprofen bottles is because </v>

1574
01:11:41.721 --> 01:11:43.290
<v Speaker 1>chronic use increased the risk of stroke</v>
<v Speaker 1>and heart attack twofold.</v>

1575
01:11:43.500 --> 01:11:44.400
<v Speaker 1>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the Mecca,</v>

1576
01:11:44.460 --> 01:11:46.860
<v Speaker 1>there was a study that was published a </v>
<v Speaker 1>few months ago,</v>

1577
01:11:47.060 --> 01:11:48.900
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was done in animals that showed the</v>

1578
01:11:48.901 --> 01:11:49.510
<v Speaker 1>mechanisms.</v>

1579
01:11:49.510 --> 01:11:52.610
<v Speaker 1>So it showed exactly what was wrong with</v>
<v Speaker 1>inhibiting Cox to,</v>

1580
01:11:52.940 --> 01:11:57.940
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been very concerned because I know </v>

1581
01:11:57.940 --> 01:12:00.090
<v Speaker 1>that like almost every female that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>know takes it once a month,</v>

1582
01:12:00.120 --> 01:12:05.120
<v Speaker 1>they'll take it once a month is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're chronically taking it every </v>

1583
01:12:05.581 --> 01:12:07.380
<v Speaker 1>month,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're taking it for a week,</v>

1584
01:12:07.470 --> 01:12:09.840
<v Speaker 1>one week out of every month and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>taking it every month.</v>

1585
01:12:09.990 --> 01:12:14.990
<v Speaker 1>So really it should be reserved for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty significant injury where you are </v>

1586
01:12:14.990 --> 01:12:16.530
<v Speaker 1>in real pain in my opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

1587
01:12:16.531 --> 01:12:21.531
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe taking it one week out of them it </v>

1588
01:12:21.531 --> 01:12:21.590
<v Speaker 1>chronic use in this wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this was done in,</v>

1589
01:12:21.750 --> 01:12:26.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's eight different clinical </v>

1590
01:12:26.750 --> 01:12:26.750
<v Speaker 1>studies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chronic use.</v>

1591
01:12:26.750 --> 01:12:26.750
<v Speaker 1>To me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chronic use is taking it every month.</v>

1592
01:12:26.750 --> 01:12:28.730
<v Speaker 1>So once a month would be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it.</v>

1593
01:12:29.680 --> 01:12:34.680
<v Speaker 1>So if you get so drunk that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucked up and you're hung over and </v>

1594
01:12:34.680 --> 01:12:35.310
<v Speaker 1>wrecked once a month,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's chronic use.</v>

1595
01:12:35.311 --> 01:12:38.170
<v Speaker 1>Then people take that for hangover.</v>

1596
01:12:38.210 --> 01:12:39.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you're,</v>

1597
01:12:39.121 --> 01:12:40.590
<v Speaker 1>if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're getting ripped,</v>

1598
01:12:40.620 --> 01:12:45.620
<v Speaker 1>if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're drinking a lot of alcohol </v>

1599
01:12:45.620 --> 01:12:45.620
<v Speaker 1>going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would you consider that chronic use?</v>

1600
01:12:46.810 --> 01:12:51.810
<v Speaker 1>So most people wouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most people think chronic users like </v>

1601
01:12:51.810 --> 01:12:52.230
<v Speaker 1>every weekend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so once a month is enough that you don't</v>

1602
01:12:52.231 --> 01:12:54.160
<v Speaker 1>have enough time to recover from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>damage,</v>

1603
01:12:54.161 --> 01:12:59.161
<v Speaker 1>is that what you're saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that once a month if you going </v>

1604
01:12:59.161 --> 01:13:00.180
<v Speaker 1>overboard like that to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1605
01:13:00.280 --> 01:13:00.780
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1606
01:13:00.970 --> 01:13:01.560
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1607
01:13:01.561 --> 01:13:03.570
<v Speaker 1>I don't really have any evidence that </v>
<v Speaker 1>once a month.</v>

1608
01:13:03.810 --> 01:13:05.860
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know there have been some studies that</v>

1609
01:13:05.861 --> 01:13:10.861
<v Speaker 1>have to look into that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would think that going out and binge </v>

1610
01:13:10.861 --> 01:13:11.010
<v Speaker 1>drinking once a month is probably not </v>
<v Speaker 1>the best thing.</v>

1611
01:13:11.450 --> 01:13:16.450
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can handle it more when you're </v>

1612
01:13:16.450 --> 01:13:17.631
<v Speaker 1>younger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but especially as you get older are our </v>

1613
01:13:17.631 --> 01:13:19.710
<v Speaker 1>capacities to handle that type of stress</v>
<v Speaker 1>or decreased,</v>

1614
01:13:20.050 --> 01:13:21.690
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So to me,</v>

1615
01:13:21.691 --> 01:13:23.970
<v Speaker 1>especially as you're getting older,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're probably not,</v>

1616
01:13:23.971 --> 01:13:25.770
<v Speaker 1>you're probably doing more damage by </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing that.</v>

1617
01:13:25.790 --> 01:13:30.790
<v Speaker 1>What I was getting at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would you be as concerned with someone </v>

1618
01:13:30.790 --> 01:13:32.130
<v Speaker 1>taking your Ibuprofen once a month as </v>
<v Speaker 1>you would be someone binge drinking once</v>

1619
01:13:32.130 --> 01:13:32.130
<v Speaker 1>a month?</v>

1620
01:13:34.570 --> 01:13:38.760
<v Speaker 1>I am concerned about Ibuprofen but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know.</v>

1621
01:13:38.940 --> 01:13:40.200
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know actually.</v>

1622
01:13:40.350 --> 01:13:43.920
<v Speaker 1>I've never heard anybody talk about </v>
<v Speaker 1>negative effects of Ibuprofen,</v>

1623
01:13:44.300 --> 01:13:49.300
<v Speaker 1>Ibuprofen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm the selective Cox two inhibitors or </v>

1624
01:13:49.300 --> 01:13:49.300
<v Speaker 1>even worse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are,</v>

1625
01:13:49.300 --> 01:13:50.640
<v Speaker 1>I don't know the brand names for them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cox,</v>

1626
01:13:50.970 --> 01:13:54.930
<v Speaker 1>Ibuprofen targets Cox two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it also targets Cox one,</v>

1627
01:13:55.260 --> 01:13:59.130
<v Speaker 1>so it's not as bad as the selective cox </v>
<v Speaker 1>to only inhibitors,</v>

1628
01:13:59.610 --> 01:14:00.210
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1629
01:14:00.211 --> 01:14:01.560
<v Speaker 1>this was big news.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1630
01:14:01.620 --> 01:14:02.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that the,</v>

1631
01:14:02.760 --> 01:14:05.340
<v Speaker 1>even the FDA,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even finally it was like,</v>

1632
01:14:05.370 --> 01:14:06.960
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something's going on here.</v>

1633
01:14:06.990 --> 01:14:10.260
<v Speaker 1>We got to at least put a warning label </v>
<v Speaker 1>on these ibuprofen volumes.</v>

1634
01:14:10.290 --> 01:14:10.980
<v Speaker 1>They started doing the,</v>

1635
01:14:12.250 --> 01:14:17.170
<v Speaker 2>I'm probably like eight months ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seven or eight months ago.</v>

1636
01:14:17.410 --> 01:14:18.750
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's very recent.</v>

1637
01:14:18.751 --> 01:14:21.550
<v Speaker 2>We consider this would have been taking </v>
<v Speaker 2>Ibuprofen.</v>

1638
01:14:21.551 --> 01:14:26.551
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I've been very concerned about my </v>

1639
01:14:26.551 --> 01:14:26.551
<v Speaker 2>mom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually got my mom this,</v>

1640
01:14:26.551 --> 01:14:28.830
<v Speaker 2>this Maria.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here it is FDA drug study after.</v>

1641
01:14:29.060 --> 01:14:34.060
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This July strengthens warning that non </v>

1642
01:14:34.060 --> 01:14:34.120
<v Speaker 2>aspirin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nonsteroidal,</v>

1643
01:14:34.121 --> 01:14:38.140
<v Speaker 2>anti inflammatory can cause heart </v>
<v Speaker 2>attacks or strokes.</v>

1644
01:14:38.500 --> 01:14:43.500
<v Speaker 2>You.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're so used to saying things like </v>

1645
01:14:43.500 --> 01:14:43.500
<v Speaker 2>ensades.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most people are like,</v>

1646
01:14:43.500 --> 01:14:43.710
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't started me.</v>

1647
01:14:43.890 --> 01:14:48.890
<v Speaker 2>No worries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The US Food and Drug Administration is </v>

1648
01:14:48.890 --> 01:14:50.650
<v Speaker 2>strengthening existing label warnings </v>
<v Speaker 2>that non aspirin,</v>

1649
01:14:50.651 --> 01:14:55.651
<v Speaker 2>nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs </v>
<v Speaker 2>increase the chance of heart attack or </v>

1650
01:14:55.651 --> 01:14:55.960
<v Speaker 2>stroke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1651
01:14:56.170 --> 01:14:59.290
<v Speaker 2>Based on our comprehensive review of </v>
<v Speaker 2>safety information,</v>

1652
01:14:59.291 --> 01:15:04.291
<v Speaker 2>we're requiring updates to drug labels </v>
<v Speaker 2>of all prescription nonsteroidal anti </v>

1653
01:15:04.920 --> 01:15:07.300
<v Speaker 2>time fly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now this says prescription prescription,</v>

1654
01:15:07.301 --> 01:15:10.450
<v Speaker 2>but if you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But ibuprofen is Ibuprofen.</v>

1655
01:15:10.451 --> 01:15:14.410
<v Speaker 2>So if you take a regular pill that has </v>
<v Speaker 2>200 milligrams you by prescription,</v>

1656
01:15:14.411 --> 01:15:16.600
<v Speaker 2>it's 800 milligrams.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always take four.</v>

1657
01:15:16.930 --> 01:15:19.180
<v Speaker 2>So four is 800.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyway.</v>

1658
01:15:19.210 --> 01:15:22.840
<v Speaker 2>So if you take for advils,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the same as a prescription.</v>

1659
01:15:22.870 --> 01:15:25.510
<v Speaker 2>Nonsteroidal anti inflammatory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I ever take it,</v>

1660
01:15:25.511 --> 01:15:27.430
<v Speaker 2>which I rarely do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always just,</v>

1661
01:15:27.670 --> 01:15:32.670
<v Speaker 2>I'm a dummy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always just go for the full dose did </v>

1662
01:15:32.670 --> 01:15:32.670
<v Speaker 2>I've been.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I got my mom.</v>

1663
01:15:32.710 --> 01:15:36.020
<v Speaker 1>It seems to be a big problem for women </v>
<v Speaker 1>because like I said,</v>

1664
01:15:36.380 --> 01:15:38.060
<v Speaker 1>they take it for menstrual pain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they're,</v>

1665
01:15:38.340 --> 01:15:43.340
<v Speaker 1>they're prone to like rely on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like every woman I know relies on </v>

1666
01:15:43.340 --> 01:15:43.730
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like for,</v>

1667
01:15:43.731 --> 01:15:45.560
<v Speaker 1>it's like you know what a little bit of </v>
<v Speaker 1>pain is.</v>

1668
01:15:45.561 --> 01:15:47.360
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you actually,</v>

1669
01:15:47.361 --> 01:15:48.260
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't had,</v>

1670
01:15:48.350 --> 01:15:51.740
<v Speaker 1>I haven't taken ibuprofen except with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the exception of like if I have,</v>

1671
01:15:51.920 --> 01:15:54.210
<v Speaker 1>if there's some like surgery or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something where I'm like,</v>

1672
01:15:54.250 --> 01:15:55.730
<v Speaker 1>Ugh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're required to take it,</v>

1673
01:15:55.731 --> 01:16:00.731
<v Speaker 1>but I haven't taken it in six years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I avoid it and I just,</v>

1674
01:16:03.051 --> 01:16:05.180
<v Speaker 1>I deal with pain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>menstrual pain,</v>

1675
01:16:05.181 --> 01:16:06.800
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and other pain,</v>

1676
01:16:06.801 --> 01:16:07.610
<v Speaker 1>I just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't,</v>

1677
01:16:07.640 --> 01:16:09.020
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not that big of a deal,</v>

1678
01:16:09.021 --> 01:16:10.580
<v Speaker 1>you start to get used to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1679
01:16:10.790 --> 01:16:13.330
<v Speaker 1>but I got my mom this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this Meriva,</v>

1680
01:16:13.520 --> 01:16:16.160
<v Speaker 1>this curcumin and phosphatidylcholine </v>
<v Speaker 1>complex.</v>

1681
01:16:16.490 --> 01:16:18.380
<v Speaker 1>And I told her I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take four of these a day,</v>

1682
01:16:18.440 --> 01:16:23.440
<v Speaker 1>which is two grams because she's got </v>
<v Speaker 1>arthritis and all sorts of chronic pain </v>

1683
01:16:23.440 --> 01:16:23.930
<v Speaker 1>and I have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard for her.</v>

1684
01:16:23.930 --> 01:16:25.880
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to like get her on the right </v>
<v Speaker 1>diet and all that.</v>

1685
01:16:25.881 --> 01:16:28.940
<v Speaker 1>But compliance is an issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if she starts to notice some changes</v>

1686
01:16:28.941 --> 01:16:31.130
<v Speaker 1>with something easy and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1687
01:16:31.131 --> 01:16:33.080
<v Speaker 1>I do see this kind of working,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1688
01:16:33.081 --> 01:16:38.081
<v Speaker 1>so that's Kinda my goal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But she said it's been helping with her </v>

1689
01:16:38.081 --> 01:16:38.081
<v Speaker 1>with her pain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also,</v>

1690
01:16:38.081 --> 01:16:38.650
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's like,</v>

1691
01:16:38.690 --> 01:16:42.220
<v Speaker 1>she's more mobile and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm from the catechumen.</v>

1692
01:16:42.800 --> 01:16:43.910
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm actually like,</v>

1693
01:16:43.940 --> 01:16:46.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking that it's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the.</v>

1694
01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:48.740
<v Speaker 1>So there was a study that I did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tell,</v>

1695
01:16:48.800 --> 01:16:51.530
<v Speaker 1>did I talk about the study that was done</v>
<v Speaker 1>that compared it to Ibuprofen.</v>

1696
01:16:51.680 --> 01:16:56.680
<v Speaker 1>So this clinical study that compared </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that took the Maria va curcumin </v>

1697
01:16:56.690 --> 01:16:58.490
<v Speaker 1>in the foster pedal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>colon complex,</v>

1698
01:16:58.710 --> 01:17:03.710
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they took two grams a day and it was </v>

1699
01:17:03.710 --> 01:17:06.371
<v Speaker 1>comparable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The anti pain relief is comparable to </v>

1700
01:17:06.371 --> 01:17:09.590
<v Speaker 1>800 milligrams of Ibuprofen or thousand </v>
<v Speaker 1>milligrams of Acetaminophen.</v>

1701
01:17:09.650 --> 01:17:13.370
<v Speaker 1>Acetaminophen can be bad for the liver </v>
<v Speaker 1>and cause liver toxicity.</v>

1702
01:17:13.670 --> 01:17:15.350
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty awesome that it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>comparable?</v>

1703
01:17:15.410 --> 01:17:20.410
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And comparable as far as the results </v>

1704
01:17:20.410 --> 01:17:22.430
<v Speaker 1>through subjective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1705
01:17:22.460 --> 01:17:24.410
<v Speaker 1>what was the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how they measure it?</v>

1706
01:17:24.440 --> 01:17:29.440
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that inflammatory markers or was it </v>

1707
01:17:29.440 --> 01:17:29.440
<v Speaker 1>like a subjective?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>

1708
01:17:29.440 --> 01:17:33.341
<v Speaker 1>I don't think other other ones have </v>
<v Speaker 1>measured inflammatory markers with that </v>

1709
01:17:33.341 --> 01:17:36.940
<v Speaker 1>curcumin and phosphatidylcholine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I don't think this a particular </v>

1710
01:17:36.940 --> 01:17:36.940
<v Speaker 1>study did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was subjective,</v>

1711
01:17:36.980 --> 01:17:38.060
<v Speaker 1>but they didn't know what they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting.</v>

1712
01:17:38.061 --> 01:17:39.830
<v Speaker 1>It was control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like double blind controlled.</v>

1713
01:17:39.831 --> 01:17:41.610
<v Speaker 1>So they were there getting something </v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1714
01:17:42.680 --> 01:17:45.380
<v Speaker 1>So it's just a matter of like them on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>one to 10.</v>

1715
01:17:45.410 --> 01:17:47.210
<v Speaker 1>How much relief did you get?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That kind of thing.</v>

1716
01:17:47.630 --> 01:17:49.370
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to look back at the study.</v>

1717
01:17:49.490 --> 01:17:52.400
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's most likely subjective though.</v>

1718
01:17:52.450 --> 01:17:57.450
<v Speaker 1>It's nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a hard time believing you don't </v>

1719
01:17:57.450 --> 01:17:57.450
<v Speaker 1>remember anything if so much shit stored</v>
<v Speaker 1>up in your brain.</v>

1720
01:17:57.450 --> 01:18:00.080
<v Speaker 1>Come flying out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you have room for?</v>

1721
01:18:00.081 --> 01:18:02.150
<v Speaker 1>Like friends' names and birthdays and </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

1722
01:18:02.151 --> 01:18:03.350
<v Speaker 1>Was it even in the calendar?</v>

1723
01:18:05.880 --> 01:18:07.970
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other question that I wanted to make</v>

1724
01:18:07.971 --> 01:18:12.971
<v Speaker 1>sure that I asked you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we talked about this through </v>

1725
01:18:12.971 --> 01:18:15.521
<v Speaker 1>email was I know that you've done a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>of work on the benefits of Sauna and the</v>

1726
01:18:15.921 --> 01:18:19.700
<v Speaker 1>heat shock proteins from sauna and I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>asking you because I recently,</v>

1727
01:18:19.730 --> 01:18:24.730
<v Speaker 1>not recently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but over the last year really got </v>

1728
01:18:24.730 --> 01:18:26.861
<v Speaker 1>heavily into hot yoga and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if that's what's going on here </v>

1729
01:18:26.861 --> 01:18:31.630
<v Speaker 1>because I leave those classes and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>swear to God a fucking asteroid could </v>

1730
01:18:31.630 --> 01:18:34.010
<v Speaker 1>hit my car and I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I guess I don't have a car anymore.</v>

1731
01:18:34.430 --> 01:18:39.430
<v Speaker 1>Sot Nom nom I stay like you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get so chilled out from doing that </v>

1732
01:18:39.430 --> 01:18:39.770
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some,</v>

1733
01:18:39.790 --> 01:18:44.790
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something going on that's akin </v>

1734
01:18:44.790 --> 01:18:47.560
<v Speaker 1>to some sort of a drug response.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I talked about this before </v>

1735
01:18:48.440 --> 01:18:50.970
<v Speaker 1>because when you're hot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're working,</v>

1736
01:18:50.990 --> 01:18:55.990
<v Speaker 1>when you're doing hot yoga,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're releasing dynorphins and the </v>

1737
01:18:55.990 --> 01:18:58.811
<v Speaker 1>reason you released I norfund is because</v>
<v Speaker 1>it cools the body and your body's like </v>

1738
01:18:58.811 --> 01:18:59.210
<v Speaker 1>when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're heating the body,</v>

1739
01:18:59.390 --> 01:19:00.470
<v Speaker 1>your body tries to cool itself.</v>

1740
01:19:00.470 --> 01:19:02.660
<v Speaker 1>When you're cooling the body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the body tries to heat itself,</v>

1741
01:19:02.661 --> 01:19:03.020
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1742
01:19:03.320 --> 01:19:04.910
<v Speaker 1>so this is what's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you're doing,</v>

1743
01:19:05.090 --> 01:19:08.270
<v Speaker 1>when you're doing the hot yoga,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're making dynorphins dynorphins.</v>

1744
01:19:08.450 --> 01:19:13.450
<v Speaker 1>So while you're doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of like physically </v>

1745
01:19:13.450 --> 01:19:15.341
<v Speaker 1>uncomfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're holding these poses and you're </v>

1746
01:19:15.341 --> 01:19:15.341
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

1747
01:19:15.341 --> 01:19:15.341
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you get out,</v>

1748
01:19:15.341 --> 01:19:17.450
<v Speaker 1>because of the whole effect on the new </v>
<v Speaker 1>opioid receptor,</v>

1749
01:19:17.451 --> 01:19:20.750
<v Speaker 1>you have more of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That endorphin that you released or that</v>

1750
01:19:20.751 --> 01:19:25.751
<v Speaker 1>endorphin you're going to release an </v>
<v Speaker 1>hour later when you see your kids or </v>

1751
01:19:25.751 --> 01:19:25.751
<v Speaker 1>whatever good thing happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1752
01:19:25.751 --> 01:19:28.700
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be like awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to feel really good.</v>

1753
01:19:28.730 --> 01:19:29.630
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's incredible.</v>

1754
01:19:29.660 --> 01:19:30.650
<v Speaker 1>It's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I,</v>

1755
01:19:30.770 --> 01:19:35.770
<v Speaker 1>that's what got me into the sauna and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the first place when I was in graduate </v>

1756
01:19:35.770 --> 01:19:38.711
<v Speaker 1>school because was me waking up once a </v>
<v Speaker 1>week and screaming and like flying </v>

1757
01:19:38.711 --> 01:19:41.840
<v Speaker 1>across the room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>punching mirrors and I literally broke.</v>

1758
01:19:41.900 --> 01:19:46.900
<v Speaker 1>I broke a mirror with my.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But while I was injured I was injured </v>

1759
01:19:46.900 --> 01:19:47.330
<v Speaker 1>for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wait a minute.</v>

1760
01:19:47.331 --> 01:19:52.331
<v Speaker 1>Where was the mirror?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was one of those mirrors that you </v>

1761
01:19:52.331 --> 01:19:54.791
<v Speaker 1>like buy at target and it's like you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>stick a full body mirror to see jumped </v>

1762
01:19:54.791 --> 01:19:56.540
<v Speaker 1>out of the bed and like throw yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>at it.</v>

1763
01:19:56.570 --> 01:20:00.250
<v Speaker 1>Well we had it like against the wall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't hung on the wall so it was</v>

1764
01:20:00.260 --> 01:20:04.220
<v Speaker 1>like cleaning cars cheap and whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just busy.</v>

1765
01:20:04.400 --> 01:20:06.260
<v Speaker 1>Whatever it does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's serving a function.</v>

1766
01:20:06.261 --> 01:20:08.310
<v Speaker 1>I can see myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I like,</v>

1767
01:20:08.400 --> 01:20:13.400
<v Speaker 1>it was kind of close to the bed so I </v>
<v Speaker 1>like flew off the bed and like hit the </v>

1768
01:20:13.400 --> 01:20:17.070
<v Speaker 1>mirror with my butt and broke it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was injured for like,</v>

1769
01:20:17.660 --> 01:20:19.590
<v Speaker 1>there was like two months I couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>run.</v>

1770
01:20:19.591 --> 01:20:21.690
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't do squats,</v>

1771
01:20:21.691 --> 01:20:22.860
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1772
01:20:22.890 --> 01:20:24.390
<v Speaker 1>if I didn't have the sauna in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mirror,</v>

1773
01:20:24.391 --> 01:20:24.960
<v Speaker 1>is that what you're saying?</v>

1774
01:20:24.960 --> 01:20:27.920
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like muscle tendon.</v>

1775
01:20:27.930 --> 01:20:29.250
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1776
01:20:29.430 --> 01:20:31.800
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea what I did all from </v>
<v Speaker 1>sleep.</v>

1777
01:20:32.250 --> 01:20:33.960
<v Speaker 1>From anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

1778
01:20:33.961 --> 01:20:35.730
<v Speaker 1>So crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you can see why.</v>

1779
01:20:35.731 --> 01:20:38.610
<v Speaker 1>Like when I discovered the sauna I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1780
01:20:39.240 --> 01:20:40.200
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is.</v>

1781
01:20:40.570 --> 01:20:42.660
<v Speaker 1>Because I would go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would go to the sauna.</v>

1782
01:20:42.661 --> 01:20:47.661
<v Speaker 1>I lived across the street from the MCA </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so the YMC has a sauna and I would </v>

1783
01:20:47.700 --> 01:20:52.260
<v Speaker 1>wake up in the morning and I'd go work </v>
<v Speaker 1>out or do the sauna both,</v>

1784
01:20:52.290 --> 01:20:57.290
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'd go and I sit in the sauna for </v>

1785
01:20:57.290 --> 01:20:59.871
<v Speaker 1>like 30 to 45 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I was pushing it and I was </v>

1786
01:20:59.871 --> 01:21:00.430
<v Speaker 1>miserable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was hot and,</v>

1787
01:21:00.760 --> 01:21:03.570
<v Speaker 1>and there are times when I would stay in</v>
<v Speaker 1>there for 45 minutes.</v>

1788
01:21:04.050 --> 01:21:09.050
<v Speaker 1>I'm not recommending people do this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just telling you what I have </v>

1789
01:21:09.050 --> 01:21:09.750
<v Speaker 1>experienced and I'd get out for five </v>
<v Speaker 1>minutes and then I go back in,</v>

1790
01:21:09.770 --> 01:21:09.910
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

1791
01:21:09.990 --> 01:21:14.990
<v Speaker 1>So I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just pushed it and that would go into </v>

1792
01:21:14.990 --> 01:21:16.860
<v Speaker 1>the lab and it didn't matter who was </v>
<v Speaker 1>stressing me out.</v>

1793
01:21:16.861 --> 01:21:21.861
<v Speaker 1>He was telling me what to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what or if my experiments were failing </v>

1794
01:21:21.861 --> 01:21:21.861
<v Speaker 1>and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

1795
01:21:21.861 --> 01:21:23.550
<v Speaker 1>six months of work down the drain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1796
01:21:23.551 --> 01:21:24.840
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't care.</v>

1797
01:21:24.841 --> 01:21:25.380
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1798
01:21:25.381 --> 01:21:30.381
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll have to start over after we think </v>

1799
01:21:30.381 --> 01:21:30.381
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1800
01:21:30.381 --> 01:21:30.381
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was.</v>

1801
01:21:30.381 --> 01:21:30.840
<v Speaker 1>So I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's when I looked and I was like,</v>

1802
01:21:31.500 --> 01:21:33.870
<v Speaker 1>something's going on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something's going on.</v>

1803
01:21:33.871 --> 01:21:35.250
<v Speaker 1>I got to figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to know.</v>

1804
01:21:35.520 --> 01:21:40.520
<v Speaker 1>And that's when I like started just </v>
<v Speaker 1>going into the brain effects on the </v>

1805
01:21:40.520 --> 01:21:43.071
<v Speaker 1>sauna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone always focuses on the </v>

1806
01:21:43.071 --> 01:21:43.071
<v Speaker 1>detoxification and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1807
01:21:43.071 --> 01:21:43.410
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something's happened in my brain.</v>

1808
01:21:43.800 --> 01:21:44.640
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what I'm saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

1809
01:21:44.641 --> 01:21:47.290
<v Speaker 1>All the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a nervous thing to do.</v>

1810
01:21:47.310 --> 01:21:51.120
<v Speaker 1>Not usually do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not really.</v>

1811
01:21:51.121 --> 01:21:52.890
<v Speaker 1>Not all the time I'll say dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not like,</v>

1812
01:21:53.130 --> 01:21:56.860
<v Speaker 1>not like you're wired,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you fired up.</v>

1813
01:21:57.190 --> 01:22:00.060
<v Speaker 1>Um.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So do you think that a similar effect is</v>

1814
01:22:00.061 --> 01:22:04.200
<v Speaker 1>happening when you're doing hot yoga?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though it's not as hot as a,</v>

1815
01:22:04.201 --> 01:22:09.201
<v Speaker 1>the sauna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's 90 minutes at 104 degrees and </v>

1816
01:22:09.201 --> 01:22:09.840
<v Speaker 1>you're doing physical activity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're straining.</v>

1817
01:22:10.230 --> 01:22:15.030
<v Speaker 1>Anything that's causing you to sweat is </v>
<v Speaker 1>gonna cause you to release the endorphin</v>

1818
01:22:15.630 --> 01:22:17.270
<v Speaker 1>because you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

1819
01:22:17.480 --> 01:22:18.530
<v Speaker 1>you're overheating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1820
01:22:18.580 --> 01:22:20.490
<v Speaker 1>That's the way your sweat is supposed to</v>
<v Speaker 1>help you.</v>

1821
01:22:20.491 --> 01:22:22.830
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're also releasing dynorphins.</v>

1822
01:22:23.250 --> 01:22:25.950
<v Speaker 1>There hasn't been a study on hot yoga.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get this question a lot.</v>

1823
01:22:25.951 --> 01:22:28.320
<v Speaker 1>There hasn't been a study on steam </v>
<v Speaker 1>rooms.</v>

1824
01:22:28.321 --> 01:22:30.990
<v Speaker 1>There hasn't been a study will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There hasn't.</v>

1825
01:22:31.030 --> 01:22:35.250
<v Speaker 1>There's been a couple of studies on hot </v>
<v Speaker 1>baths are a Jacuzzi's,</v>

1826
01:22:35.580 --> 01:22:37.860
<v Speaker 1>but not looking at the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at other things.</v>

1827
01:22:38.090 --> 01:22:41.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm personally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you just think about the mechanisms,</v>

1828
01:22:41.461 --> 01:22:44.430
<v Speaker 1>I think that it's very likely and if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna,</v>

1829
01:22:44.520 --> 01:22:47.280
<v Speaker 1>if you're pushing yourself to sweat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you feel uncomfortable,</v>

1830
01:22:47.760 --> 01:22:48.840
<v Speaker 1>then you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

1831
01:22:48.870 --> 01:22:53.870
<v Speaker 1>you're doing the right thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're releasing dynorphins and you're </v>

1832
01:22:53.870 --> 01:22:53.870
<v Speaker 1>getting the heat shock proteins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're getting all that good stuff.</v>

1833
01:22:53.910 --> 01:22:56.220
<v Speaker 1>So it makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1834
01:22:56.640 --> 01:22:57.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's in it.</v>

1835
01:22:57.691 --> 01:23:02.691
<v Speaker 1>It is very addicting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also part of the reason why </v>

1836
01:23:02.691 --> 01:23:02.691
<v Speaker 1>exercise can become addicting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People always,</v>

1837
01:23:02.691 --> 01:23:04.350
<v Speaker 1>always attributed to the endorphin </v>
<v Speaker 1>release.</v>

1838
01:23:05.140 --> 01:23:07.670
<v Speaker 1>I actually think it has a lot to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also with the dynorphins,</v>

1839
01:23:07.750 --> 01:23:12.750
<v Speaker 1>the pain you experienced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the discomfort you experience is very </v>

1840
01:23:12.750 --> 01:23:12.750
<v Speaker 1>important,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1841
01:23:12.750 --> 01:23:17.280
<v Speaker 1>because you're actually then having that</v>
<v Speaker 1>response that hormetic you can almost </v>

1842
01:23:17.280 --> 01:23:20.890
<v Speaker 1>think of it as a hormetic response </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the discomfort is what's causing</v>

1843
01:23:21.130 --> 01:23:26.130
<v Speaker 1>you to make more of the new opioid </v>
<v Speaker 1>receptors that you're more sensitive to </v>

1844
01:23:26.130 --> 01:23:26.130
<v Speaker 1>the endorphin and more sensitive to </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1845
01:23:26.530 --> 01:23:29.170
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>feel good stuff.</v>

1846
01:23:29.560 --> 01:23:34.560
<v Speaker 2>It's funny because that's one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>main things that people try to avoid in </v>

1847
01:23:34.560 --> 01:23:36.070
<v Speaker 2>life is discomfort.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is probably,</v>

1848
01:23:36.071 --> 01:23:38.530
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you looked at especially lazy people,</v>

1849
01:23:38.680 --> 01:23:40.880
<v Speaker 2>you looked at the primary thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they try to avoid the turn.</v>

1850
01:23:40.980 --> 01:23:41.860
<v Speaker 2>Avoid Discomfort.</v>

1851
01:23:42.080 --> 01:23:43.040
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

1852
01:23:43.310 --> 01:23:45.890
<v Speaker 1>Like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this morning I woke up and I was like,</v>

1853
01:23:45.950 --> 01:23:50.090
<v Speaker 1>I have to go to gym,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to go and have to,</v>

1854
01:23:50.091 --> 01:23:52.210
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to like push it and I was running.</v>

1855
01:23:52.220 --> 01:23:54.620
<v Speaker 1>I was doing sprinting on the treadmill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Usually I,</v>

1856
01:23:54.740 --> 01:23:55.490
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1857
01:23:55.910 --> 01:23:58.520
<v Speaker 1>usually a sprint,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the last end of my run,</v>

1858
01:23:58.521 --> 01:24:00.830
<v Speaker 1>but I was just spreading and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I was doing it.</v>

1859
01:24:00.831 --> 01:24:01.280
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1860
01:24:01.281 --> 01:24:03.110
<v Speaker 1>this sucks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this sucks,</v>

1861
01:24:03.111 --> 01:24:06.740
<v Speaker 1>but I have to do it because I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my brain is going to help me.</v>

1862
01:24:06.830 --> 01:24:10.220
<v Speaker 1>The dynorphins and also the </v>
<v Speaker 1>norepinephrine norepinephrine,</v>

1863
01:24:10.221 --> 01:24:12.410
<v Speaker 1>which is um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you release when you exercise,</v>

1864
01:24:12.411 --> 01:24:17.411
<v Speaker 1>release a lot of it in the cold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I took a cold shower to cold shower was </v>

1865
01:24:17.411 --> 01:24:20.891
<v Speaker 1>like a pretty good as well because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>cold also norepinephrine released nor </v>

1866
01:24:22.370 --> 01:24:27.370
<v Speaker 1>nor epinephrin when you're exposed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>cold because norepinephrine causes </v>

1867
01:24:27.370 --> 01:24:30.590
<v Speaker 1>vasodilation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so when you have vasodilation,</v>

1868
01:24:30.591 --> 01:24:34.100
<v Speaker 1>you actually are losing less heat.</v>

1869
01:24:34.660 --> 01:24:36.730
<v Speaker 2>I always take cold showers after hot </v>
<v Speaker 2>yoga.</v>

1870
01:24:37.720 --> 01:24:42.720
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing in the winter because in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the winter there was actually cold </v>

1871
01:24:42.720 --> 01:24:44.490
<v Speaker 2>because of water here is not really that</v>
<v Speaker 2>cold because it's California.</v>

1872
01:24:44.860 --> 01:24:49.860
<v Speaker 2>If it gets cold out it's like 50,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when it's 50 the water's actually </v>

1873
01:24:49.860 --> 01:24:54.541
<v Speaker 2>cold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like after a hot yoga you get in </v>

1874
01:24:54.541 --> 01:24:54.541
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really uncomfortable.</v>

1875
01:24:54.541 --> 01:24:55.510
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to breathe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

1876
01:24:55.570 --> 01:25:00.570
<v Speaker 2>But when I lived in Boston,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a guy named Bob a roller that </v>

1877
01:25:00.570 --> 01:25:01.960
<v Speaker 2>I used to do taekwondo with this guy in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the middle of January.</v>

1878
01:25:01.961 --> 01:25:06.961
<v Speaker 2>We take cold showers and he'd say that </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's good for the spirit and he was </v>

1879
01:25:06.961 --> 01:25:06.961
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the only guy that would do it,</v>

1880
01:25:06.961 --> 01:25:08.080
<v Speaker 2>everybody would just stand there and </v>
<v Speaker 2>watch them.</v>

1881
01:25:08.081 --> 01:25:13.081
<v Speaker 2>Bob's going to go in the shower and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>go in the shower by himself and to </v>

1882
01:25:13.081 --> 01:25:13.081
<v Speaker 2>obviously by himself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're like,</v>

1883
01:25:13.210 --> 01:25:18.210
<v Speaker 2>we're going in the shower with him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this guy would take these cold </v>

1884
01:25:18.210 --> 01:25:18.370
<v Speaker 2>showers and I just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't imagine why anybody would put</v>

1885
01:25:18.371 --> 01:25:23.371
<v Speaker 2>themselves through something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I guess he kind of knew even back </v>

1886
01:25:23.371 --> 01:25:26.500
<v Speaker 2>then there was some sort of a benefit to</v>
<v Speaker 2>standing in that freezing cold water and</v>

1887
01:25:26.501 --> 01:25:30.970
<v Speaker 2>just not just mentally as far as like </v>
<v Speaker 2>your discipline and your self control to</v>

1888
01:25:30.971 --> 01:25:33.430
<v Speaker 2>be able to stand there and force </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself to do something like that,</v>

1889
01:25:33.670 --> 01:25:35.770
<v Speaker 2>to have that sort of autonomy over your </v>
<v Speaker 2>body like that,</v>

1890
01:25:36.100 --> 01:25:39.670
<v Speaker 2>but also because there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's all these different releases,</v>

1891
01:25:39.671 --> 01:25:43.360
<v Speaker 2>these powerful endorphin releases that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're getting from that.</v>

1892
01:25:43.700 --> 01:25:44.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it feels good.</v>

1893
01:25:44.780 --> 01:25:45.530
<v Speaker 1>It feels really good.</v>

1894
01:25:45.930 --> 01:25:50.930
<v Speaker 2>Is there any danger in going from say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a hot yoga class to cryotherapy?</v>

1895
01:25:53.480 --> 01:25:56.840
<v Speaker 1>I would love to know the answer to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I've.</v>

1896
01:25:56.930 --> 01:25:59.410
<v Speaker 1>I've recently experienced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1897
01:25:59.480 --> 01:26:02.630
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've gone from a really hot sauna,</v>

1898
01:26:02.660 --> 01:26:07.660
<v Speaker 1>like crazy hot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was like 180 degrees </v>

1899
01:26:07.660 --> 01:26:07.700
<v Speaker 1>Fahrenheit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1900
01:26:07.701 --> 01:26:11.530
<v Speaker 1>I had to wear one of those hats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was crazy hot,</v>

1901
01:26:11.531 --> 01:26:16.370
<v Speaker 1>like the hottest I've ever experienced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I went and I was with an acquaintance</v>

1902
01:26:16.400 --> 01:26:17.670
<v Speaker 1>of mine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1903
01:26:17.680 --> 01:26:21.410
<v Speaker 1>and then I went directly into an ice </v>
<v Speaker 1>bath and I did four rounds of this,</v>

1904
01:26:21.600 --> 01:26:24.230
<v Speaker 1>like for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it,</v>

1905
01:26:24.380 --> 01:26:29.380
<v Speaker 1>like the experience itself was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I felt really,</v>

1906
01:26:30.141 --> 01:26:31.820
<v Speaker 1>really good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really good,</v>

1907
01:26:31.900 --> 01:26:35.210
<v Speaker 1>like euphoric entering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I was in the cold.</v>

1908
01:26:35.630 --> 01:26:40.630
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once you go in the ice bath and you go </v>

1909
01:26:40.630 --> 01:26:40.630
<v Speaker 1>back into the sauna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1910
01:26:40.630 --> 01:26:41.930
<v Speaker 1>and you're in 180 degree Fahrenheit </v>
<v Speaker 1>Sauna,</v>

1911
01:26:42.080 --> 01:26:44.690
<v Speaker 1>it actually feels like room temperature </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's kind of like,</v>

1912
01:26:45.290 --> 01:26:49.190
<v Speaker 1>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is something kind of cool about it.</v>

1913
01:26:49.190 --> 01:26:50.780
<v Speaker 1>Like you just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you feel really,</v>

1914
01:26:50.781 --> 01:26:52.400
<v Speaker 1>really good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1915
01:26:52.730 --> 01:26:57.730
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were points when I started to get </v>

1916
01:26:57.730 --> 01:26:59.411
<v Speaker 1>a little light headed and spinny so </v>
<v Speaker 1>spinny and it was maybe low blood </v>

1917
01:27:02.961 --> 01:27:04.370
<v Speaker 1>pressure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>low blood glucose.</v>

1918
01:27:04.371 --> 01:27:05.030
<v Speaker 1>I hadn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1919
01:27:05.031 --> 01:27:06.200
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

1920
01:27:06.201 --> 01:27:08.150
<v Speaker 1>But I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

1921
01:27:08.151 --> 01:27:10.640
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm really wanting to know and I have to</v>

1922
01:27:11.060 --> 01:27:12.290
<v Speaker 1>look into the literature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1923
01:27:12.291 --> 01:27:17.291
<v Speaker 1>I put,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just recently put out a report and a </v>

1924
01:27:17.291 --> 01:27:17.450
<v Speaker 1>podcast on cryotherapy and the benefits </v>
<v Speaker 1>of cold,</v>

1925
01:27:18.110 --> 01:27:23.110
<v Speaker 1>but I really was hoping to find more on </v>
<v Speaker 1>going from hot to cold because mostly </v>

1926
01:27:23.241 --> 01:27:28.241
<v Speaker 1>one I felt so good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the other thing it does it reset my </v>

1927
01:27:28.241 --> 01:27:28.241
<v Speaker 1>circadian rhythm completely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I just,</v>

1928
01:27:28.241 --> 01:27:30.650
<v Speaker 1>I went to bed at like 9:30</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I slept like a baby.</v>

1929
01:27:30.920 --> 01:27:32.950
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you think it did that?</v>

1930
01:27:34.010 --> 01:27:36.350
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that there's something,</v>

1931
01:27:36.680 --> 01:27:39.050
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it was the hot cold or </v>
<v Speaker 1>just the cold,</v>

1932
01:27:39.490 --> 01:27:40.520
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ics.</v>

1933
01:27:41.030 --> 01:27:43.670
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I did this around 6:00</v>

1934
01:27:43.730 --> 01:27:47.690
<v Speaker 1>so it was like right before bedtime,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm cold.</v>

1935
01:27:47.691 --> 01:27:49.520
<v Speaker 1>Does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know there is a circuit,</v>

1936
01:27:49.700 --> 01:27:54.700
<v Speaker 1>there is a regulation of when your body </v>
<v Speaker 1>starts to cool itself and it cools </v>

1937
01:27:54.700 --> 01:27:55.730
<v Speaker 1>itself right before sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Melatonin plays a role in that.</v>

1938
01:27:55.940 --> 01:28:00.940
<v Speaker 1>When you make Melatonin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it actually starts to cool the body a </v>

1939
01:28:00.940 --> 01:28:01.340
<v Speaker 1>little bit as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really don't know,</v>

1940
01:28:01.341 --> 01:28:02.540
<v Speaker 1>Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was trying to figure it out,</v>

1941
01:28:03.020 --> 01:28:08.020
<v Speaker 1>people aren't doing studies on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was very real and I experienced </v>

1942
01:28:08.020 --> 01:28:08.360
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there a difference between doing cold</v>

1943
01:28:08.361 --> 01:28:10.700
<v Speaker 1>before you go to the bed and doing a </v>
<v Speaker 1>song before you go to bed?</v>

1944
01:28:10.701 --> 01:28:15.701
<v Speaker 1>As far as the results I'm doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sauna sometimes can actually like </v>

1945
01:28:16.310 --> 01:28:19.430
<v Speaker 1>immediately keep you up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also it's.</v>

1946
01:28:19.700 --> 01:28:23.480
<v Speaker 1>It affects rem sleep and that's been </v>
<v Speaker 1>shown and piglets as well and Dan swears</v>

1947
01:28:23.481 --> 01:28:25.460
<v Speaker 1>that he would have all sorts of lucid </v>
<v Speaker 1>dreams.</v>

1948
01:28:26.410 --> 01:28:31.410
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't really remember that aspect of </v>

1949
01:28:31.410 --> 01:28:32.030
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it does seem to affect sleep,</v>

1950
01:28:32.060 --> 01:28:35.600
<v Speaker 1>so lucid dreams from like the heat or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

1951
01:28:36.160 --> 01:28:36.990
<v Speaker 1>Probably not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>

1952
01:28:37.040 --> 01:28:38.690
<v Speaker 1>Maybe something else going on in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>brain.</v>

1953
01:28:38.691 --> 01:28:41.780
<v Speaker 1>You also do release norepinephrine from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from anything.</v>

1954
01:28:41.781 --> 01:28:44.870
<v Speaker 1>That's when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're stressing your body,</v>

1955
01:28:44.871 --> 01:28:46.400
<v Speaker 1>when you're doing your workout,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good enough.</v>

1956
01:28:46.401 --> 01:28:51.401
<v Speaker 1>Like any sort of stress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also a stimulation like novelty </v>

1957
01:28:51.401 --> 01:28:52.250
<v Speaker 1>releases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>norepinephrine and that,</v>

1958
01:28:52.370 --> 01:28:54.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe Acetylcholine is being released.</v>

1959
01:28:54.921 --> 01:28:56.360
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1960
01:28:56.370 --> 01:28:57.690
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're calling.</v>

1961
01:28:57.790 --> 01:29:00.660
<v Speaker 1>It does have some sort of a positive </v>
<v Speaker 1>effect on,</v>

1962
01:29:00.700 --> 01:29:02.010
<v Speaker 1>on dreaming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1963
01:29:02.370 --> 01:29:07.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People report really intense lucid </v>

1964
01:29:07.370 --> 01:29:08.100
<v Speaker 2>dreams from taking a lot of different </v>
<v Speaker 2>nootropics,</v>

1965
01:29:08.101 --> 01:29:09.240
<v Speaker 2>but particularly Coleen,</v>

1966
01:29:09.630 --> 01:29:14.630
<v Speaker 1>someone was telling me about galantamine</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I was talking about it before </v>

1967
01:29:14.630 --> 01:29:14.670
<v Speaker 1>and someone was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1968
01:29:14.671 --> 01:29:16.800
<v Speaker 1>this causes lucid dreams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't have known that,</v>

1969
01:29:17.250 --> 01:29:19.320
<v Speaker 1>but there's some.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1970
01:29:19.321 --> 01:29:20.480
<v Speaker 1>there's some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some aspect.</v>

1971
01:29:21.280 --> 01:29:26.280
<v Speaker 2>Five htp as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Five htp may be beneficial to lucid </v>

1972
01:29:26.280 --> 01:29:27.280
<v Speaker 2>dreaming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something about</v>

1973
01:29:27.750 --> 01:29:32.750
<v Speaker 1>that's strange because Serotonin in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>brain gets you out of it.</v>

1974
01:29:33.960 --> 01:29:36.410
<v Speaker 1>It takes you out of rem sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Serotonin</v>

1975
01:29:36.770 --> 01:29:41.770
<v Speaker 2>takes you out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you were going to take five htp </v>

1976
01:29:41.770 --> 01:29:41.770
<v Speaker 2>should take it in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then</v>

1977
01:29:41.770 --> 01:29:44.430
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the whole half life </v>
<v Speaker 1>and all that.</v>

1978
01:29:44.431 --> 01:29:49.431
<v Speaker 1>I mean it has to like five htp has to </v>
<v Speaker 1>then get into your brain and then be </v>

1979
01:29:49.431 --> 01:29:49.431
<v Speaker 1>converted to Serotonin and</v>

1980
01:29:49.530 --> 01:29:54.530
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it might actually be good to take it </v>

1981
01:29:54.530 --> 01:29:54.530
<v Speaker 2>at night and then by the morning rolls </v>
<v Speaker 2>around,</v>

1982
01:29:54.530 --> 01:29:56.350
<v Speaker 2>it's done converting it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1983
01:29:56.430 --> 01:29:56.970
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1984
01:29:57.060 --> 01:29:58.400
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1985
01:29:58.820 --> 01:30:03.820
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would it take to do some sort of a </v>

1986
01:30:03.820 --> 01:30:06.741
<v Speaker 2>study like the study that has been done </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the sauna for something like hot </v>

1987
01:30:06.741 --> 01:30:08.640
<v Speaker 2>yoga?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What would you do that,</v>

1988
01:30:10.220 --> 01:30:12.620
<v Speaker 1>let's see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it depends on what you want to measure.</v>

1989
01:30:12.680 --> 01:30:16.730
<v Speaker 1>So I think if you want to look at heat </v>
<v Speaker 1>shock proteins,</v>

1990
01:30:17.340 --> 01:30:20.150
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could look at them in blood cells,</v>

1991
01:30:20.151 --> 01:30:23.180
<v Speaker 1>so you can measure them in blood cells.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could look at,</v>

1992
01:30:23.181 --> 01:30:28.181
<v Speaker 1>you could measure norepinephrine from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's actually a biomarker of </v>

1993
01:30:28.181 --> 01:30:32.621
<v Speaker 1>norepinephrine that is called salivary </v>
<v Speaker 1>Alpha amylase and it's released in </v>

1994
01:30:32.621 --> 01:30:37.001
<v Speaker 1>saliva.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And actually it would actually be </v>

1995
01:30:37.001 --> 01:30:37.001
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be a marker,</v>

1996
01:30:37.001 --> 01:30:41.231
<v Speaker 1>like if your workout,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're pushing your workout hard </v>

1997
01:30:41.231 --> 01:30:43.391
<v Speaker 1>enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll release more of that Alpha </v>

1998
01:30:43.391 --> 01:30:43.391
<v Speaker 1>amylase,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some more,</v>

1999
01:30:43.391 --> 01:30:44.150
<v Speaker 1>more norepinephrine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you can measure that.</v>

2000
01:30:44.960 --> 01:30:49.960
<v Speaker 1>And then hsps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you just have to have volunteers and </v>

2001
01:30:49.960 --> 01:30:53.801
<v Speaker 1>then sauna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you'd have to have a lot of people </v>

2002
01:30:53.801 --> 01:30:53.801
<v Speaker 1>that are gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2003
01:30:53.801 --> 01:30:56.030
<v Speaker 1>take the blood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to have physicians involved and</v>

2004
01:30:56.031 --> 01:30:57.970
<v Speaker 1>then you have to have people that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>gonna,</v>

2005
01:30:58.020 --> 01:31:01.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isolate and look at the protein.</v>

2006
01:31:01.220 --> 01:31:03.380
<v Speaker 1>Maybe even looking at gene expression </v>
<v Speaker 1>would be cheaper.</v>

2007
01:31:04.310 --> 01:31:06.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing something similar but not with</v>
<v Speaker 1>sauna.</v>

2008
01:31:06.201 --> 01:31:09.140
<v Speaker 1>I've been involved in a clinical trial </v>
<v Speaker 1>with blueberries.</v>

2009
01:31:09.950 --> 01:31:13.010
<v Speaker 1>Actually another one of those plant </v>
<v Speaker 1>hormetic compounds.</v>

2010
01:31:13.070 --> 01:31:15.500
<v Speaker 1>There's another one in blueberries </v>
<v Speaker 1>called Anthocyanins,</v>

2011
01:31:15.501 --> 01:31:16.520
<v Speaker 1>which is really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

2012
01:31:16.730 --> 01:31:19.170
<v Speaker 1>blueberries contain a small amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>territory.</v>

2013
01:31:19.630 --> 01:31:23.290
<v Speaker 1>They contain very late,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about 10 percent of a grape skin has.</v>

2014
01:31:23.291 --> 01:31:25.190
<v Speaker 1>So the blueberries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

2015
01:31:25.210 --> 01:31:27.890
<v Speaker 1>what's really good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And blueberries is called anthocyanins.</v>

2016
01:31:27.891 --> 01:31:31.460
<v Speaker 1>Anthocyanins are produced as a response,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2017
01:31:31.480 --> 01:31:33.590
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're a plant insecticide.</v>

2018
01:31:34.010 --> 01:31:39.010
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they actually like they bind to a </v>

2019
01:31:39.010 --> 01:31:40.760
<v Speaker 1>certain gene,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Anthocyanin itself recognizes like a</v>

2020
01:31:40.761 --> 01:31:44.390
<v Speaker 1>little sequence of DNA and turn and bind</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the street and like turns it on.</v>

2021
01:31:44.391 --> 01:31:48.200
<v Speaker 1>And this gene is called NRF two and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a master regulator of all these,</v>

2022
01:31:48.201 --> 01:31:51.980
<v Speaker 1>like really good repairing DNA repair </v>
<v Speaker 1>enzymes.</v>

2023
01:31:52.160 --> 01:31:54.720
<v Speaker 1>I'm antioxidant enzymes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anti-inflammatory,</v>

2024
01:31:54.740 --> 01:31:55.640
<v Speaker 1>all these good things.</v>

2025
01:31:56.000 --> 01:32:01.000
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so I've been involved in a clinical </v>

2026
01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:02.981
<v Speaker 1>trial for the past two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe even two and a half years now </v>

2027
01:32:02.981 --> 01:32:02.990
<v Speaker 1>where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2028
01:32:03.310 --> 01:32:05.110
<v Speaker 1>my colleagues and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've been looking,</v>

2029
01:32:05.140 --> 01:32:08.050
<v Speaker 1>we've been taking blood from people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>

2030
01:32:08.950 --> 01:32:13.930
<v Speaker 1>they're obese.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their BMI is about 28 or above.</v>

2031
01:32:14.230 --> 01:32:16.450
<v Speaker 1>They're obese.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their insulin 28 is,</v>

2032
01:32:16.500 --> 01:32:17.950
<v Speaker 1>he is obese.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2033
01:32:17.951 --> 01:32:21.850
<v Speaker 1>they also measure BMI is 30 is actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>obese.</v>

2034
01:32:21.851 --> 01:32:26.851
<v Speaker 1>We moved it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we moved the BMI down to 28 because it </v>

2035
01:32:26.851 --> 01:32:26.851
<v Speaker 1>was like we weren't getting enough </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

2036
01:32:26.851 --> 01:32:29.590
<v Speaker 1>A 30 is technically considered obese.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2037
01:32:29.710 --> 01:32:32.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2038
01:32:32.231 --> 01:32:34.140
<v Speaker 1>I mean a lot of people were 30,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2039
01:32:34.150 --> 01:32:39.150
<v Speaker 1>You have to consider BMI is not a really</v>
<v Speaker 1>good measure of obesity because people </v>

2040
01:32:39.150 --> 01:32:43.060
<v Speaker 1>that are very muscular and short may </v>
<v Speaker 1>also have a high BMI.</v>

2041
01:32:43.061 --> 01:32:46.500
<v Speaker 1>So you have to also look at waist </v>
<v Speaker 1>circumference and other factors which,</v>

2042
01:32:46.960 --> 01:32:48.770
<v Speaker 1>which they are doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2043
01:32:48.790 --> 01:32:51.040
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there are a lot of obese people.</v>

2044
01:32:51.250 --> 01:32:56.250
<v Speaker 1>There are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are a lot of obese people and </v>

2045
01:32:56.250 --> 01:32:58.021
<v Speaker 1>we're looking at a certain percentage of</v>
<v Speaker 1>them that are right on the border of </v>

2046
01:32:58.021 --> 01:33:01.141
<v Speaker 1>becoming type two diabetics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're insulin resistant so their </v>

2047
01:33:01.141 --> 01:33:04.120
<v Speaker 1>body is not responding to insulin but </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not type two diabetic clinically</v>

2048
01:33:04.121 --> 01:33:05.340
<v Speaker 1>yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2049
01:33:05.370 --> 01:33:06.130
<v Speaker 1>and so we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

2050
01:33:06.180 --> 01:33:11.180
<v Speaker 1>we're getting rid recruiting these </v>
<v Speaker 1>people and we've gotten 50 of them and </v>

2051
01:33:11.180 --> 01:33:14.851
<v Speaker 1>half of them are getting a freeze dried </v>
<v Speaker 1>blueberry powder that's equivalent to </v>

2052
01:33:15.341 --> 01:33:20.341
<v Speaker 1>two cups of blueberries and it's got </v>
<v Speaker 1>lots of anthocyanins and all this other </v>

2053
01:33:20.341 --> 01:33:24.061
<v Speaker 1>stuff that's in the blueberries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the other half is getting a placebo </v>

2054
01:33:24.061 --> 01:33:25.060
<v Speaker 1>drink,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is blue looking and they put sugar</v>

2055
01:33:25.061 --> 01:33:25.710
<v Speaker 1>in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is.</v>

2056
01:33:26.750 --> 01:33:31.750
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you gotta you can't give someone a </v>

2057
01:33:31.750 --> 01:33:31.750
<v Speaker 1>placebo and not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And not taste like blueberry.</v>

2058
01:33:31.750 --> 01:33:35.691
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there any benefit to eating actual </v>

2059
01:33:35.691 --> 01:33:35.691
<v Speaker 1>blueberries versus the freeze dried </v>
<v Speaker 1>powders?</v>

2060
01:33:35.691 --> 01:33:36.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're getting the fiber,</v>

2061
01:33:38.020 --> 01:33:39.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

2062
01:33:39.011 --> 01:33:41.560
<v Speaker 1>you're getting probably that's the main </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

2063
01:33:41.561 --> 01:33:46.561
<v Speaker 1>that fiber and who knows what other </v>
<v Speaker 1>compounds that may be not maybe </v>

2064
01:33:46.561 --> 01:33:47.650
<v Speaker 1>destroyed somewhat by the freeze.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dry.</v>

2065
01:33:47.660 --> 01:33:52.660
<v Speaker 1>I don't really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I would be confused about </v>

2066
01:33:52.660 --> 01:33:52.660
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've always been confused about that.</v>

2067
01:33:52.660 --> 01:33:53.920
<v Speaker 1>And when you see the various freeze </v>
<v Speaker 1>dried,</v>

2068
01:33:54.520 --> 01:33:56.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything or any,</v>

2069
01:33:56.021 --> 01:33:58.060
<v Speaker 1>any sort of dried,</v>
<v Speaker 1>powdered anything,</v>

2070
01:33:58.300 --> 01:34:00.460
<v Speaker 1>I always wonder like how much of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are you actually giving?</v>

2071
01:34:00.760 --> 01:34:01.420
<v Speaker 1>Like what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

2072
01:34:01.530 --> 01:34:06.530
<v Speaker 1>what's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much of the actual benefit is lost </v>

2073
01:34:06.530 --> 01:34:06.530
<v Speaker 1>in this turn?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Turning it into a pill.</v>

2074
01:34:06.670 --> 01:34:08.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's definitely some,</v>

2075
01:34:08.210 --> 01:34:13.210
<v Speaker 1>some things that are lost,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the specific things that I'm </v>

2076
01:34:13.210 --> 01:34:13.210
<v Speaker 1>interested in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the anthocyanins are there.</v>

2077
01:34:13.780 --> 01:34:16.350
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but so what I've been looking at it,</v>

2078
01:34:16.351 --> 01:34:18.310
<v Speaker 1>there's other people that I'm working </v>
<v Speaker 1>with are looking at,</v>

2079
01:34:18.340 --> 01:34:19.430
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2080
01:34:19.840 --> 01:34:22.480
<v Speaker 1>markers of inflammation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>glucose response,</v>

2081
01:34:22.481 --> 01:34:24.070
<v Speaker 1>like all the metabolic parameters.</v>

2082
01:34:24.070 --> 01:34:28.660
<v Speaker 1>I'm specifically looking at people's </v>
<v Speaker 1>damage to their DNA.</v>

2083
01:34:28.720 --> 01:34:33.720
<v Speaker 1>So like we get white blood cells and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>frozen down and then I look at the DNA </v>

2084
01:34:33.720 --> 01:34:35.230
<v Speaker 1>and the white blood cells and see how </v>
<v Speaker 1>much damage there is.</v>

2085
01:34:35.740 --> 01:34:40.740
<v Speaker 1>I do it at baseline.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So before they start the blueberry </v>

2086
01:34:40.740 --> 01:34:40.740
<v Speaker 1>powders and these people have a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>damage because they're obese.</v>

2087
01:34:40.740 --> 01:34:42.130
<v Speaker 1>Obesity accelerates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>damage to DNA,</v>

2088
01:34:42.370 --> 01:34:44.890
<v Speaker 1>damage to DNA causes all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems.</v>

2089
01:34:44.891 --> 01:34:49.390
<v Speaker 1>But eventually it leads to cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And people that are obese have a twofold</v>

2090
01:34:49.750 --> 01:34:54.750
<v Speaker 1>increased risk of multiple cancers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ridiculous article that I read were </v>

2091
01:34:54.750 --> 01:34:57.990
<v Speaker 1>talking about the positive benefits of </v>
<v Speaker 1>being overweight and were</v>

2092
01:34:57.990 --> 01:35:01.970
<v Speaker 2>where people were trying to justify </v>
<v Speaker 2>being overweight and they were.</v>

2093
01:35:01.980 --> 01:35:06.980
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking about there's a certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>illnesses that people recover from </v>

2094
01:35:07.041 --> 01:35:12.041
<v Speaker 2>better if they're overweight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they were very few very strange </v>

2095
01:35:12.111 --> 01:35:16.370
<v Speaker 2>examples they were using.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They try to justify being overweight.</v>

2096
01:35:16.720 --> 01:35:21.720
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was also the article was also </v>

2097
01:35:21.720 --> 01:35:23.600
<v Speaker 2>impartially in response to quote unquote</v>
<v Speaker 2>fat shaming,</v>

2098
01:35:23.930 --> 01:35:24.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm like,</v>

2099
01:35:24.650 --> 01:35:27.290
<v Speaker 2>boy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is just such a weird justification.</v>

2100
01:35:27.470 --> 01:35:31.490
<v Speaker 2>It's so bizarre that your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your very biology,</v>

2101
01:35:31.491 --> 01:35:33.350
<v Speaker 2>very the thing that gets you through </v>
<v Speaker 2>life,</v>

2102
01:35:33.560 --> 01:35:37.400
<v Speaker 2>that people are so intent on receiving </v>
<v Speaker 2>mouth pleasure,</v>

2103
01:35:37.730 --> 01:35:38.840
<v Speaker 2>which is all it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2104
01:35:38.841 --> 01:35:40.910
<v Speaker 2>that's what you're doing when you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>shoveling food in your mouth,</v>

2105
01:35:40.911 --> 01:35:43.460
<v Speaker 2>you're getting mouth pleasure and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're getting the response,</v>

2106
01:35:43.461 --> 01:35:46.280
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the physical response to whatever sugars</v>

2107
01:35:46.281 --> 01:35:47.130
<v Speaker 2>or anything that you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

2108
01:35:47.131 --> 01:35:47.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

2109
01:35:47.720 --> 01:35:50.360
<v Speaker 2>your body and your gut bacteria craving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But so,</v>

2110
01:35:50.390 --> 01:35:55.390
<v Speaker 2>so much into that you're broadcasting it</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the form of this is like really </v>

2111
01:35:55.390 --> 01:35:59.591
<v Speaker 2>misleading article that was just </v>
<v Speaker 2>designed to make you feel better for </v>

2112
01:35:59.811 --> 01:36:03.740
<v Speaker 2>being overweight and to justify these </v>
<v Speaker 2>choices that you've made,</v>

2113
01:36:03.741 --> 01:36:06.020
<v Speaker 2>which are terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>terrible choices.</v>

2114
01:36:06.021 --> 01:36:08.090
<v Speaker 2>Like there's no benefit whatsoever to </v>
<v Speaker 2>being overweight,</v>

2115
01:36:08.091 --> 01:36:08.350
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2116
01:36:08.720 --> 01:36:09.410
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2117
01:36:09.411 --> 01:36:14.411
<v Speaker 1>being overweight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being overweight is linked to increased </v>

2118
01:36:14.451 --> 01:36:17.330
<v Speaker 1>risk for cardiovascular disease,</v>
<v Speaker 1>increased risk for type two diabetes,</v>

2119
01:36:17.331 --> 01:36:20.330
<v Speaker 1>increased risk for cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>increased risk of stroke in prison.</v>

2120
01:36:20.331 --> 01:36:21.090
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2121
01:36:21.130 --> 01:36:23.090
<v Speaker 1>it's increased rate of Alzheimer's </v>
<v Speaker 1>disease.</v>

2122
01:36:23.350 --> 01:36:28.350
<v Speaker 1>It's yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I mean having an increased risk for </v>

2123
01:36:28.350 --> 01:36:29.640
<v Speaker 1>all of those age related diseases is not</v>
<v Speaker 1>good to them.</v>

2124
01:36:29.850 --> 01:36:32.750
<v Speaker 1>Articles written about the positive </v>
<v Speaker 1>benefits being overweight.</v>

2125
01:36:32.920 --> 01:36:37.920
<v Speaker 1>I haven't seen those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see if you can find some of that </v>

01:36:37.920 --> 01:36:41.410
<v Speaker 2>people that are fat that are just trying</v>
<v Speaker 2>to use confirmation bias and locked into</v>

2128
01:36:42.350 --> 01:36:47.350
<v Speaker 2>whatever small,</v>
<v Speaker 2>weird statistic might exist in regards </v>

2129
01:36:47.350 --> 01:36:50.210
<v Speaker 2>to like maybe they'd get over like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>cold better or something.</v>

2130
01:36:50.211 --> 01:36:51.890
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's really dumb.</v>

01:36:51.980 --> 01:36:56.980
<v Speaker 1>Actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obesity starts to cause I'm </v>

<v Speaker 1>their body and inflammation takes a lot </v>

2135
01:37:07.810 --> 01:37:08.660
<v Speaker 1>of energy.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Being overweight carries a reduced Chris</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rheumatoid arthritis.</v>

2138
01:37:15.860 --> 01:37:18.470

<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

2139
01:37:18.490 --> 01:37:21.490
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to see the references on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Being overweight means</v>

2140
01:37:21.490 --> 01:37:26.490
<v Speaker 2>you're less likely to develop dementia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Being overweight can make a stronger </v>

2141
01:37:26.921 --> 01:37:27.850
<v Speaker 2>immune system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2142
01:37:27.851 --> 01:37:32.851
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's one of the things that I had </v>

<v Speaker 2>from possible harm.</v>

2148
01:37:44.861 --> 01:37:49.861

<v Speaker 2>Harmless even before incursion to </v>

2149
01:37:49.861 --> 01:37:53.641
<v Speaker 2>explain on a slightly more plain level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the cytologists are proposing that </v>

<v Speaker 2>Being overweight is linked to increase </v>

2166

<v Speaker 2>longevity and recovery time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What know?</v>

<v Speaker 2>despite overweight individuals being </v>

2173
01:39:03.350 --> 01:39:03.720
<v Speaker 2>more susceptible to serious health </v>
<v Speaker 2>issues to begin with,</v>

2174
01:39:03.721 --> 01:39:08.721
<v Speaker 2>they are less likely to die from them </v>
<v Speaker 2>than those who are underweight or even </v>

2175
01:39:08.721 --> 01:39:10.260
<v Speaker 2>with healthy BMI is heart disease,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

2176
01:39:10.261 --> 01:39:14.700
<v Speaker 2>is four times more likely to claim the </v>
<v Speaker 2>life of somebody with a healthy Bmi than</v>

2177
01:39:14.701 --> 01:39:17.090
<v Speaker 2>an individual considered overweight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is horseshit.</v>

2178
01:39:17.190 --> 01:39:19.920
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is not absolutely opposite.</v>

2179
01:39:19.940 --> 01:39:22.170
<v Speaker 2>No studies that the onion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is this a forest?</v>

2180
01:39:22.180 --> 01:39:22.710
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

2181
01:39:22.711 --> 01:39:24.150
<v Speaker 2>What is the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is the website?</v>

2182
01:39:24.390 --> 01:39:29.390
<v Speaker 2>The Telegraph.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whether articles too is just the one I </v>

2183
01:39:29.390 --> 01:39:32.151
<v Speaker 2>figured would have the scroll.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Scroll down a little further and being </v>

2184
01:39:32.151 --> 01:39:32.550
<v Speaker 2>overweight can mean you're better in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>bedroom.</v>

2185
01:39:32.551 --> 01:39:33.960
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shut the fuck up.</v>

2186
01:39:34.200 --> 01:39:36.990
<v Speaker 2>This is a fat guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fat Guy wrote this hormones,</v>

2187
01:39:36.991 --> 01:39:41.991
<v Speaker 2>found in abdominal fat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>allow men to last longer in the bedroom </v>

2188
01:39:41.991 --> 01:39:41.991
<v Speaker 2>bowl.</v>

2189
01:39:41.991 --> 01:39:46.260
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to see the references for any </v>
<v Speaker 1>of these statements because actually </v>

2190
01:39:46.260 --> 01:39:47.080
<v Speaker 1>it's quite the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Being overweight or being obese,</v>

2191
01:39:47.380 --> 01:39:49.390
<v Speaker 1>it's associated with seven years off </v>
<v Speaker 1>your life span,</v>

2192
01:39:49.420 --> 01:39:52.160
<v Speaker 1>extremely obese is 14 years off your </v>
<v Speaker 1>life span.</v>

2193
01:39:52.640 --> 01:39:57.640
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obesity is the number one risk factor </v>

2194
01:39:57.640 --> 01:39:58.840
<v Speaker 1>for heart disease and type two diabetes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2195
01:39:59.020 --> 01:40:01.100
<v Speaker 1>it also is associated with massive </v>
<v Speaker 1>inflammation.</v>

2196
01:40:01.100 --> 01:40:04.520
<v Speaker 2>What's this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Journal of sexual medicine inside on</v>

2197
01:40:04.550 --> 01:40:09.550
<v Speaker 2>pathogenesis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Genesis of lifelong premature </v>

2198
01:40:09.550 --> 01:40:12.341
<v Speaker 2>ejaculation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Inverse relationship between lifelong </v>

2199
01:40:12.341 --> 01:40:13.580
<v Speaker 2>premature ejaculation and obesity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2200
01:40:13.581 --> 01:40:18.581
<v Speaker 2>but you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's because of the obese guys aren't </v>

2201
01:40:18.581 --> 01:40:18.581
<v Speaker 2>getting laid and they probably jerk off </v>
<v Speaker 2>so much.</v>

2202
01:40:18.581 --> 01:40:21.110
<v Speaker 2>They can last forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a stupid study.</v>

2203
01:40:21.111 --> 01:40:22.730
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is an association.</v>

2204
01:40:22.731 --> 01:40:26.780
<v Speaker 2>There's some premature ejaculation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Has to do with anxiety,</v>

2205
01:40:26.781 --> 01:40:31.781
<v Speaker 2>has to do a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of factors involved and </v>

2206
01:40:31.781 --> 01:40:32.240
<v Speaker 2>premature ejaculation and what exactly </v>
<v Speaker 2>is premature?</v>

2207
01:40:32.450 --> 01:40:37.450
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's a completely relative and </v>
<v Speaker 2>subjective term because if you come and </v>

2208
01:40:37.450 --> 01:40:38.360
<v Speaker 2>you enjoyed it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was perfectly timed.</v>

2209
01:40:39.020 --> 01:40:44.020
<v Speaker 2>It's not premature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's just like you didn't hold </v>

2210
01:40:44.020 --> 01:40:47.171
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the whole idea of holding on as </v>

2211
01:40:47.171 --> 01:40:48.440
<v Speaker 2>long as a cultural construct holding on </v>
<v Speaker 2>as long as you can.</v>

2212
01:40:48.620 --> 01:40:50.990
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've decided that that's a good thing.</v>

2213
01:40:51.220 --> 01:40:53.120
<v Speaker 2>I mean obviously for mutually</v>

2214
01:40:54.400 --> 01:40:57.940
<v Speaker 3>mutually beneficial pleasurable </v>
<v Speaker 3>experience for your partner.</v>

2215
01:40:57.941 --> 01:41:00.790
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's probably last longer than you know,</v>

2216
01:41:00.791 --> 01:41:02.470
<v Speaker 3>that's what woman would like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but.</v>

2217
01:41:03.130 --> 01:41:04.750
<v Speaker 3>But what is pr?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not premature.</v>

2218
01:41:04.751 --> 01:41:05.220
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2219
01:41:05.270 --> 01:41:07.930
<v Speaker 3>the end goal is to try to breed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's try to procreate,</v>

2220
01:41:07.960 --> 01:41:10.570
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is if you get it in there and as long as</v>

2221
01:41:10.571 --> 01:41:12.520
<v Speaker 3>you get it in there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not premature.</v>

2222
01:41:12.670 --> 01:41:17.670
<v Speaker 3>Like biologically speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it sounds like it's pretty subjective </v>

2223
01:41:17.670 --> 01:41:18.130
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Their definition of premature.</v>

2224
01:41:18.300 --> 01:41:23.300
<v Speaker 3>I mean what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let the idea that you can connect all </v>

2225
01:41:23.300 --> 01:41:26.260
<v Speaker 3>those things and say that there's some </v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of a positive benefit to being fat.</v>

2226
01:41:26.261 --> 01:41:28.150
<v Speaker 3>That's click bait bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what that is.</v>

2227
01:41:28.960 --> 01:41:30.440
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's very</v>

2228
01:41:30.580 --> 01:41:34.450
<v Speaker 1>strong evidence of everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The opposite of what you just read.</v>

2229
01:41:34.490 --> 01:41:36.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I just don't even.</v>

2230
01:41:36.510 --> 01:41:38.330
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really just don't even know where they</v>

2231
01:41:38.580 --> 01:41:43.580
<v Speaker 1>came from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe some crappy associative studies </v>

2232
01:41:43.580 --> 01:41:43.580
<v Speaker 1>that were done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean the large body of,</v>

2233
01:41:43.770 --> 01:41:48.770
<v Speaker 3>of the literature shows the opposite,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but isn't that way confusing when you </v>

2234
01:41:48.770 --> 01:41:52.701
<v Speaker 3>see things like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like in the Telegraph that probably got </v>

2235
01:41:52.701 --> 01:41:53.470
<v Speaker 3>read by a million plus people or more </v>
<v Speaker 3>worldwide?</v>

2236
01:41:53.490 --> 01:41:55.530
<v Speaker 3>Probably even more than that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's irritating.</v>

2237
01:41:55.550 --> 01:41:56.540
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2238
01:41:56.850 --> 01:42:01.850
<v Speaker 3>but those are the kinds of articles that</v>
<v Speaker 3>people will use to justify their poor </v>

2239
01:42:01.850 --> 01:42:04.080
<v Speaker 3>life choices and this was this same kind</v>
<v Speaker 3>of thing.</v>

2240
01:42:04.081 --> 01:42:09.081
<v Speaker 3>Not that article in particular is what </v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd read about when someone was talking </v>

2241
01:42:09.081 --> 01:42:09.081
<v Speaker 3>about fat shaming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2242
01:42:09.081 --> 01:42:09.420
<v Speaker 3>come on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2243
01:42:09.421 --> 01:42:11.600
<v Speaker 3>There's no such thing as fat shaming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

2244
01:42:11.660 --> 01:42:13.890
<v Speaker 3>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's rude to be mean to people.</v>

2245
01:42:13.950 --> 01:42:18.950
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's rude to like pointed someone laugh </v>

2246
01:42:18.950 --> 01:42:20.991
<v Speaker 3>because they're fat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but to suggest that someone being </v>

2247
01:42:20.991 --> 01:42:21.750
<v Speaker 3>overweight is bad for the health is not </v>
<v Speaker 3>fat shaming.</v>

2248
01:42:21.751 --> 01:42:22.680
<v Speaker 3>It's just fact.</v>

2249
01:42:23.160 --> 01:42:23.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's also,</v>

2250
01:42:23.911 --> 01:42:28.911
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to help someone you want </v>

2251
01:42:28.911 --> 01:42:28.911
<v Speaker 1>to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

2252
01:42:28.911 --> 01:42:28.911
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

2253
01:42:28.911 --> 01:42:32.331
<v Speaker 1>there have we know mechanism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know there's been studies that show </v>

2254
01:42:32.331 --> 01:42:34.110
<v Speaker 1>that being overweight causes </v>
<v Speaker 1>inflammation.</v>

2255
01:42:34.111 --> 01:42:39.111
<v Speaker 1>It's your immune system's constantly </v>
<v Speaker 1>being active and not get crosses into </v>

2256
01:42:39.111 --> 01:42:41.760
<v Speaker 1>the brain and causes depression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It causes anxiety,</v>

2257
01:42:41.910 --> 01:42:46.910
<v Speaker 1>it causes learning and memory problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you may not be working and that's </v>

2258
01:42:46.910 --> 01:42:47.700
<v Speaker 1>been shown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You may not be working at your optimum,</v>

2259
01:42:48.390 --> 01:42:49.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being overweight,</v>

2260
01:42:49.820 --> 01:42:51.690
<v Speaker 1>you could feel better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2261
01:42:51.691 --> 01:42:54.780
<v Speaker 1>so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of ridiculous.</v>

2262
01:42:54.781 --> 01:42:59.781
<v Speaker 1>I think I agree with you and I have </v>
<v Speaker 1>friends that are overweight and I've </v>

2263
01:42:59.781 --> 01:43:02.370
<v Speaker 1>always been the person that I'm all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I'm lecturing,</v>

2264
01:43:02.371 --> 01:43:03.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's always,</v>

2265
01:43:03.391 --> 01:43:08.391
<v Speaker 1>I'm always like all these benefits and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>rattle off all this stuff and all this </v>

2266
01:43:08.391 --> 01:43:11.040
<v Speaker 1>information and then there's a certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>point it's like this person probably has</v>

2267
01:43:11.041 --> 01:43:14.070
<v Speaker 1>gets defensive and doesn't want to hear </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

2268
01:43:14.520 --> 01:43:19.520
<v Speaker 1>but I care about them and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually part of the reason I started </v>

2269
01:43:19.520 --> 01:43:22.161
<v Speaker 1>making videos and doing what I do </v>
<v Speaker 1>without my fitness actually because I </v>

2270
01:43:22.161 --> 01:43:23.340
<v Speaker 1>was constantly doing this to friends and</v>
<v Speaker 1>family members,</v>

2271
01:43:23.341 --> 01:43:27.300
<v Speaker 1>people I cared about where it was like </v>
<v Speaker 1>at least if you put something out there,</v>

2272
01:43:27.450 --> 01:43:31.230
<v Speaker 1>like if you put a video out there or an </v>
<v Speaker 1>article or a podcast or something,</v>

2273
01:43:31.740 --> 01:43:33.330
<v Speaker 1>they don't feel like you're targeting </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

2274
01:43:33.700 --> 01:43:34.740
<v Speaker 1>So then you can just go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>

2275
01:43:34.741 --> 01:43:36.510
<v Speaker 1>I talked about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should go check it out.</v>

2276
01:43:37.110 --> 01:43:38.520
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know what it does.</v>

2277
01:43:38.521 --> 01:43:40.530
<v Speaker 1>It seems because people would get less </v>
<v Speaker 1>defensive.</v>

2278
01:43:41.510 --> 01:43:46.510
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it seems to me that there's a certain </v>

2279
01:43:46.510 --> 01:43:48.170
<v Speaker 3>amount of information just won't get </v>
<v Speaker 3>through some people's wall.</v>

2280
01:43:48.530 --> 01:43:50.120
<v Speaker 3>They have a wall,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is what I like to do.</v>

2281
01:43:50.121 --> 01:43:51.710
<v Speaker 3>I like to eat cake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

2282
01:43:51.950 --> 01:43:52.700
<v Speaker 3>And then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2283
01:43:52.730 --> 01:43:57.730
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>KC has sugar and sugar is bad and being </v>

2284
01:43:57.730 --> 01:43:59.010
<v Speaker 3>obese is bad and cancer and blood </v>
<v Speaker 3>pressure and uh,</v>

2285
01:43:59.060 --> 01:44:01.510
<v Speaker 3>sorry it's not getting in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going home.</v>

2286
01:44:01.511 --> 01:44:06.511
<v Speaker 3>I'll have some fucking cake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of a rule like that mouth </v>

2287
01:44:06.511 --> 01:44:08.830
<v Speaker 3>pleasure that they get from shoving that</v>
<v Speaker 3>cake and oh,</v>

2288
01:44:08.870 --> 01:44:11.240
<v Speaker 3>they just can't wait.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the craving,</v>

2289
01:44:11.510 --> 01:44:16.510
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we had talked quite a bit about gut </v>

2290
01:44:16.510 --> 01:44:18.980
<v Speaker 3>bacteria because of your experience with</v>
<v Speaker 3>probiotics and also your experience with</v>

2291
01:44:18.981 --> 01:44:23.981
<v Speaker 3>antibiotics from recovering from staph </v>
<v Speaker 3>infection and how devastating was to </v>

2292
01:44:23.981 --> 01:44:27.911
<v Speaker 3>your immune system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I started going down the rabbit hole </v>

2293
01:44:27.911 --> 01:44:30.761
<v Speaker 3>with a gut bacteria after that because I</v>
<v Speaker 3>just found it so fascinating how long it</v>

2294
01:44:30.801 --> 01:44:35.801
<v Speaker 3>took you to recover and how a common </v>
<v Speaker 3>that experiences from large doses of </v>

2295
01:44:36.801 --> 01:44:41.801
<v Speaker 3>antibiotics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how devastating it is to the immune </v>

2296
01:44:41.801 --> 01:44:44.591
<v Speaker 3>system to overall health wellness per </v>
<v Speaker 3>the way you feel the way you like,</v>

2297
01:44:45.380 --> 01:44:46.520
<v Speaker 3>your mood,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your mood.</v>

2298
01:44:46.550 --> 01:44:51.020
<v Speaker 3>So many different effects.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the things that I've found when I</v>

2299
01:44:51.021 --> 01:44:55.490
<v Speaker 3>was eating a lot of bread and pasta is </v>
<v Speaker 3>that I would have a good meal,</v>

2300
01:44:55.640 --> 01:45:00.640
<v Speaker 3>like say I would have like chicken with </v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe some vegetables or something like </v>

2301
01:45:01.191 --> 01:45:06.191
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a nice big healthy meal and I would </v>

2302
01:45:06.191 --> 01:45:07.100
<v Speaker 3>still be hungry afterwards for sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would like my body.</v>

2303
01:45:07.101 --> 01:45:09.710
<v Speaker 3>I was stuffed like I ate like half a </v>
<v Speaker 3>chicken.</v>

2304
01:45:09.711 --> 01:45:12.320
<v Speaker 3>I'll eat a half a chicken and my body </v>
<v Speaker 3>was like,</v>

2305
01:45:12.321 --> 01:45:14.480
<v Speaker 3>we need a cookie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need a cookie.</v>

2306
01:45:14.481 --> 01:45:15.620
<v Speaker 3>Come on man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Give me a cookie.</v>

2307
01:45:15.800 --> 01:45:17.510
<v Speaker 3>Like I need some ice cream.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was,</v>

2308
01:45:17.570 --> 01:45:22.570
<v Speaker 3>there was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was some gut bacteria craving and </v>

2309
01:45:22.570 --> 01:45:24.050
<v Speaker 3>that's what it seemed like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seemed like some bizarre craving.</v>

2310
01:45:24.290 --> 01:45:27.260
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't a craving like I needed more </v>
<v Speaker 3>calories.</v>

2311
01:45:27.670 --> 01:45:29.780
<v Speaker 1>Where were you eating these?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like was this.</v>

2312
01:45:29.870 --> 01:45:32.870
<v Speaker 1>Would you typically eat something that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>refined sugar?</v>

2313
01:45:32.890 --> 01:45:33.470
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2314
01:45:33.471 --> 01:45:33.890
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2315
01:45:33.891 --> 01:45:34.220
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2316
01:45:34.221 --> 01:45:39.221
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is an interesting effect and sorry </v>

2317
01:45:39.221 --> 01:45:42.701
<v Speaker 1>if I cut you off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but something that does happen when you </v>

2318
01:45:42.701 --> 01:45:43.870
<v Speaker 1>eat refined sugars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like something,</v>

2319
01:45:44.210 --> 01:45:49.210
<v Speaker 1>not a piece of fruit which has the fiber</v>
<v Speaker 1>matrix and all these polyphenols.</v>

2320
01:45:49.851 --> 01:45:51.800
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>polyphenols are plant insecticides.</v>

2321
01:45:51.801 --> 01:45:53.960
<v Speaker 1>It's all we were talking about has all </v>
<v Speaker 1>this other good stuff.</v>

2322
01:45:54.230 --> 01:45:56.660
<v Speaker 1>When you take the refined sugar away </v>
<v Speaker 1>from that,</v>

2323
01:45:58.130 --> 01:46:03.130
<v Speaker 1>what happens is when your your gut,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so your gut digest it and it refined </v>

2324
01:46:04.041 --> 01:46:09.041
<v Speaker 1>sugar usually is like a glucose mol.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's 50 percent glucose and 50 percent </v>

2325
01:46:09.041 --> 01:46:13.751
<v Speaker 1>fructose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's sucrose and that's what's in </v>

2326
01:46:13.751 --> 01:46:15.610
<v Speaker 1>table.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sugar is what's in a lot of refined </v>

2327
01:46:15.610 --> 01:46:17.111
<v Speaker 1>sugars and what happens is that when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>cleave the sucrose in the end,</v>

2328
01:46:17.830 --> 01:46:19.970
<v Speaker 1>you cleaned the sucrose to this glucose </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the fructose,</v>

2329
01:46:20.150 --> 01:46:23.570
<v Speaker 1>the fruit toast itself doesn't get </v>
<v Speaker 1>absorbed by all the cells.</v>

2330
01:46:23.570 --> 01:46:26.960
<v Speaker 1>It only gets metabolized in the liver </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it does something.</v>

2331
01:46:27.020 --> 01:46:32.020
<v Speaker 1>It's called ATP trapping.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what it does is it traps ATP,</v>

2332
01:46:32.991 --> 01:46:37.991
<v Speaker 1>which is the source of energy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it does this because it's trying to </v>

2333
01:46:37.991 --> 01:46:38.120
<v Speaker 1>like do this whole other complicated </v>
<v Speaker 1>enzymatic reaction,</v>

2334
01:46:38.330 --> 01:46:38.770
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

2335
01:46:38.771 --> 01:46:39.290
<v Speaker 1>blah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2336
01:46:39.560 --> 01:46:44.560
<v Speaker 1>But what it does is trap the ATP and </v>
<v Speaker 1>this sends a signal through the vagal </v>

2337
01:46:44.560 --> 01:46:46.370
<v Speaker 1>nerve to your brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have energy,</v>

2338
01:46:46.371 --> 01:46:50.310
<v Speaker 1>and so you don't get satiated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so when you eat refined sugars,</v>

2339
01:46:51.230 --> 01:46:56.230
<v Speaker 1>and this is independent from the gut </v>
<v Speaker 1>bacteria craving stuff you're talking </v>

2340
01:46:56.230 --> 01:46:56.370
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not exactly sure how all that works,</v>

2341
01:46:56.371 --> 01:47:01.370
<v Speaker 1>but what I'm talking about is real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's ATP trapping and it's.</v>

2342
01:47:01.371 --> 01:47:02.040
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2343
01:47:02.100 --> 01:47:05.940
<v Speaker 1>it's something that is known to be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>cause of y.</v>

2344
01:47:05.941 --> 01:47:09.930
<v Speaker 1>You can eat a bunch of fructose and </v>
<v Speaker 1>refined sugar and not be satiated,</v>

2345
01:47:09.931 --> 01:47:12.120
<v Speaker 1>and so you have to eat more because your</v>
<v Speaker 1>body,</v>

2346
01:47:12.121 --> 01:47:16.200
<v Speaker 1>your brain thinks you haven't been fed </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the APP has been trapped.</v>

2347
01:47:16.230 --> 01:47:19.920
<v Speaker 1>It's called ATP trapping.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one possibility that could be,</v>

2348
01:47:20.100 --> 01:47:22.200
<v Speaker 1>could have been happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really,</v>

2349
01:47:22.201 --> 01:47:27.201
<v Speaker 1>it's also why a lot of people that eat a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of refined sugars with sucrose or </v>

2350
01:47:27.201 --> 01:47:29.430
<v Speaker 1>high fructose corn syrup is the worst </v>
<v Speaker 1>when they eat that.</v>

2351
01:47:29.780 --> 01:47:31.440
<v Speaker 1>Why is high fructose Corn Syrup to </v>
<v Speaker 1>worse?</v>

2352
01:47:31.470 --> 01:47:35.130
<v Speaker 1>Because then so when your gut,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the way your gut.</v>

2353
01:47:35.220 --> 01:47:35.970
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's just.</v>

2354
01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:39.630
<v Speaker 1>Let's compare table sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sucrose or high fructose corn syrup.</v>

2355
01:47:39.720 --> 01:47:42.630
<v Speaker 1>Both are bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you compare the two,</v>

2356
01:47:43.590 --> 01:47:47.280
<v Speaker 1>because sucrose is got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's got glucose.</v>

2357
01:47:47.281 --> 01:47:50.340
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's got glucose and fructose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>high fructose corn syrup does to you.</v>

2358
01:47:50.341 --> 01:47:52.390
<v Speaker 1>It has more fructose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the thing is,</v>

2359
01:47:52.391 --> 01:47:53.350
<v Speaker 1>is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2360
01:47:53.760 --> 01:47:55.680
<v Speaker 1>when it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the sucrose sees your gut,</v>

2361
01:47:55.681 --> 01:47:57.900
<v Speaker 1>your gut has something in it called sue </v>
<v Speaker 1>crazes,</v>

2362
01:47:58.230 --> 01:47:59.730
<v Speaker 1>which clique,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which it takes,</v>

2363
01:47:59.760 --> 01:48:04.760
<v Speaker 1>basically it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's slower to cleave and digest the </v>

2364
01:48:04.760 --> 01:48:06.820
<v Speaker 1>sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's not like a big bolus at your gut</v>

2365
01:48:06.821 --> 01:48:11.821
<v Speaker 1>sees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's not as irritating on the gut </v>

2366
01:48:11.821 --> 01:48:14.390
<v Speaker 1>because it has the first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the suit crazes have to cleave the suit </v>

2367
01:48:14.390 --> 01:48:14.390
<v Speaker 1>gross and so like all this stuff is </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening.</v>

2368
01:48:14.390 --> 01:48:16.050
<v Speaker 1>Whereas when you get the high fructose </v>
<v Speaker 1>corn syrup,</v>

2369
01:48:16.410 --> 01:48:19.110
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a big bolus and it's like,</v>

2370
01:48:19.290 --> 01:48:23.400
<v Speaker 1>it literally like causes a breakdown in </v>
<v Speaker 1>your gut barrier.</v>

2371
01:48:23.490 --> 01:48:25.200
<v Speaker 1>It's like irritant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an irritant.</v>

2372
01:48:25.590 --> 01:48:27.840
<v Speaker 1>The same thing can happen if you take </v>
<v Speaker 1>too much of,</v>

2373
01:48:28.340 --> 01:48:30.660
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's lots of other things that</v>

2374
01:48:30.661 --> 01:48:35.661
<v Speaker 1>happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you take too much like magnesium </v>

2375
01:48:35.661 --> 01:48:35.661
<v Speaker 1>or something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people can get gut irritation.</v>

2376
01:48:35.661 --> 01:48:39.930
<v Speaker 1>It's a big bolus on the gut and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>irritant and that's what high fructose </v>

2377
01:48:39.930 --> 01:48:42.831
<v Speaker 1>corn syrup does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's also then the whole atp </v>

2378
01:48:42.831 --> 01:48:44.280
<v Speaker 1>trapping thing is like exponential with </v>
<v Speaker 1>high fructose corn syrup,</v>

2379
01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:46.320
<v Speaker 1>fructose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's compounded.</v>

2380
01:48:46.321 --> 01:48:48.690
<v Speaker 1>There's a bunch of different factors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a bunch of different factors.</v>

2381
01:48:48.691 --> 01:48:53.691
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fructose is very different in fruit </v>

2382
01:48:53.691 --> 01:48:53.691
<v Speaker 1>because the matrix,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fiber,</v>

2383
01:48:53.691 --> 01:48:54.990
<v Speaker 1>it's digested differently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>

2384
01:48:54.991 --> 01:48:59.520
<v Speaker 1>It's completely different than taking a </v>
<v Speaker 1>table sugar or high fructose corn syrup.</v>

2385
01:48:59.550 --> 01:49:02.280
<v Speaker 1>Who's the monster that extracted that </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff?</v>

2386
01:49:03.060 --> 01:49:05.880
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so bad windows that done.</v>

2387
01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:09.300
<v Speaker 1>When do they figure out how to do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they used to do cane sugar rose.</v>

2388
01:49:10.040 --> 01:49:11.610
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2389
01:49:11.940 --> 01:49:15.090
<v Speaker 1>I know there's people that are super </v>
<v Speaker 1>into to all that stuff,</v>

2390
01:49:15.120 --> 01:49:16.350
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's cheaper.</v>

2391
01:49:16.470 --> 01:49:19.440
<v Speaker 1>That's why it's cheaper and it's hidden.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's in everything.</v>

2392
01:49:20.070 --> 01:49:24.120
<v Speaker 1>If you go out and go to a Chili's and </v>
<v Speaker 1>think they're going to eat healthy,</v>

2393
01:49:24.121 --> 01:49:26.700
<v Speaker 1>you order a salad and there's like 60 </v>
<v Speaker 1>grams of sugar in there.</v>

2394
01:49:26.701 --> 01:49:29.340
<v Speaker 1>Waldorf Salad because it's all in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dressing.</v>

2395
01:49:29.400 --> 01:49:31.510
<v Speaker 1>High Fructose Corn Syrup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's insane.</v>

2396
01:49:31.800 --> 01:49:32.610
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here it is.</v>

2397
01:49:32.850 --> 01:49:37.850
<v Speaker 1>The 1970.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was first introduced to food and </v>

2398
01:49:37.850 --> 01:49:40.581
<v Speaker 1>beverage industry of high fructose corn </v>
<v Speaker 1>Syrup was first introduced to the food </v>

2399
01:49:40.581 --> 01:49:42.210
<v Speaker 1>and beverage industry in the 19 </v>
<v Speaker 1>seventies.</v>

2400
01:49:42.540 --> 01:49:46.440
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing that that stuff from 1970</v>
<v Speaker 1>until today,</v>

2401
01:49:46.441 --> 01:49:51.441
<v Speaker 1>so in the the last 40 plus years has </v>
<v Speaker 1>become a massive part of our diets.</v>

2402
01:49:53.290 --> 01:49:58.290
<v Speaker 1>The average this was published and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was like the Health Organization and </v>

2403
01:49:58.900 --> 01:50:01.360
<v Speaker 1>somewhere in the UK and whatever they </v>
<v Speaker 1>call that.</v>

2404
01:50:01.580 --> 01:50:06.580
<v Speaker 1>There were some health organization and </v>
<v Speaker 1>UK that that did a press release and </v>

2405
01:50:06.580 --> 01:50:09.730
<v Speaker 1>said that the average five-year-old </v>
<v Speaker 1>consumes 50 grams of sugar a day.</v>

2406
01:50:09.790 --> 01:50:11.440
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>

2407
01:50:11.770 --> 01:50:16.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>50 grams to 50 grams a day or that 50 </v>

2408
01:50:16.770 --> 01:50:17.950
<v Speaker 1>grand a year and two grams a day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's 50 grams a day.</v>

2409
01:50:18.220 --> 01:50:20.790
<v Speaker 1>Which was their weight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was okay.</v>

2410
01:50:20.800 --> 01:50:22.000
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm remembering it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2411
01:50:22.001 --> 01:50:23.800
<v Speaker 1>it would be awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was 50 grams a day,</v>

2412
01:50:23.801 --> 01:50:26.500
<v Speaker 1>which was the average of their entire </v>
<v Speaker 1>body weight.</v>

2413
01:50:26.790 --> 01:50:29.020
<v Speaker 1>Have a five year old a year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a year,</v>

2414
01:50:29.140 --> 01:50:32.230
<v Speaker 1>so if you have a bag of sugar the size </v>
<v Speaker 1>of a five year old,</v>

2415
01:50:32.290 --> 01:50:34.540
<v Speaker 1>five year old eat that in the year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

2416
01:50:34.541 --> 01:50:39.541
<v Speaker 1>She's and I did some calculations that </v>
<v Speaker 1>comes out to like a pumpkin spice latte </v>

2417
01:50:39.541 --> 01:50:40.990
<v Speaker 1>at starbucks which has like 64 grams of </v>
<v Speaker 1>sugar.</v>

2418
01:50:41.950 --> 01:50:45.100
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's crazy and everything.</v>

2419
01:50:47.050 --> 01:50:49.630
<v Speaker 1>There's a particular type of gut </v>
<v Speaker 1>bacteria,</v>

2420
01:50:49.631 --> 01:50:52.540
<v Speaker 1>they crave sugar and that thrives on </v>
<v Speaker 1>sugar though,</v>

2421
01:50:52.541 --> 01:50:54.090
<v Speaker 1>isn't there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2422
01:50:54.560 --> 01:50:57.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeast are surviving on sugar,</v>

2423
01:50:57.161 --> 01:50:58.880
<v Speaker 1>but they're not gut bacteria.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

2424
01:50:59.310 --> 01:51:01.110
<v Speaker 1>there was like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a documentary,</v>

2425
01:51:01.130 --> 01:51:06.130
<v Speaker 1>an online thing that I watched on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>various documentary on different gut </v>

2426
01:51:06.701 --> 01:51:08.320
<v Speaker 1>bacteria,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that attracted to,</v>

2427
01:51:08.590 --> 01:51:10.450
<v Speaker 1>so I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe this is,</v>

2428
01:51:10.990 --> 01:51:15.990
<v Speaker 1>I know that so that your gut bacteria </v>
<v Speaker 1>with what they eat is fiber and they're </v>

2429
01:51:16.060 --> 01:51:18.670
<v Speaker 1>mostly in your colon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so when you're,</v>

2430
01:51:18.700 --> 01:51:21.500
<v Speaker 1>when you eat fiber deficient diet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2431
01:51:21.760 --> 01:51:23.050
<v Speaker 1>proteins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lipids,</v>

2432
01:51:23.830 --> 01:51:26.470
<v Speaker 1>sugars are all absorbed in the upper </v>
<v Speaker 1>intestine,</v>

2433
01:51:26.500 --> 01:51:31.500
<v Speaker 1>but your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your bacteria in your gut starve and in </v>

2434
01:51:31.500 --> 01:51:35.371
<v Speaker 1>order to stop themselves from starving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they start to cannibalize the gut </v>

2435
01:51:35.371 --> 01:51:36.910
<v Speaker 1>barrier that they live on because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>got carbohydrates.</v>

2436
01:51:36.911 --> 01:51:41.911
<v Speaker 1>And so low fiber diet can cause massive </v>
<v Speaker 1>gut barrier breakdown.</v>

2437
01:51:42.010 --> 01:51:44.410
<v Speaker 1>It's actually the most in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 1>magnitude,</v>

2438
01:51:44.411 --> 01:51:46.830
<v Speaker 1>the most potent thing that regulates gut</v>
<v Speaker 1>health is fiber.</v>

2439
01:51:47.050 --> 01:51:48.940
<v Speaker 1>So is that like irritable bowel </v>
<v Speaker 1>syndrome,</v>

2440
01:51:48.941 --> 01:51:50.400
<v Speaker 1>things along those lines?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2441
01:51:50.440 --> 01:51:52.300
<v Speaker 1>that can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that can happen,</v>

2442
01:51:52.301 --> 01:51:57.301
<v Speaker 1>but you don't have to have irritable </v>
<v Speaker 1>bowel syndrome to have your gut barrier </v>

2443
01:51:57.301 --> 01:51:57.301
<v Speaker 1>breaking down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2444
01:51:57.301 --> 01:51:59.110
<v Speaker 1>you can have a low level of </v>
<v Speaker 1>inflammation,</v>

2445
01:51:59.111 --> 01:52:04.111
<v Speaker 1>not know it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there are certain types of bacteria </v>

2446
01:52:04.111 --> 01:52:08.880
<v Speaker 1>that can thrive in the condition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now maybe that maybe let's say you have </v>

2447
01:52:09.011 --> 01:52:14.011
<v Speaker 1>a low fiber diet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning you're eating a lot of refined </v>

2448
01:52:14.011 --> 01:52:14.170
<v Speaker 1>sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's Kinda like the same,</v>

2449
01:52:14.171 --> 01:52:19.171
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're eating a bunch of refined sugar </v>

2450
01:52:19.171 --> 01:52:19.270
<v Speaker 1>and in place of plants and fiber rich </v>
<v Speaker 1>foods,</v>

2451
01:52:19.750 --> 01:52:24.750
<v Speaker 1>there's a certain type of bacteria that </v>
<v Speaker 1>can thrive on low fiber and it's a type </v>

2452
01:52:24.750 --> 01:52:25.080
<v Speaker 1>of bacteria,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know the name of,</v>

2453
01:52:25.090 --> 01:52:28.210
<v Speaker 1>but they have little flagella things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that like move,</v>

2454
01:52:28.211 --> 01:52:29.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sperm sperm it.</v>

2455
01:52:29.880 --> 01:52:30.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly like that.</v>

2456
01:52:30.881 --> 01:52:35.881
<v Speaker 1>And so they'll like swim up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So your bacteria are supposed to be in </v>

2457
01:52:35.881 --> 01:52:35.881
<v Speaker 1>the colon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let very,</v>

2458
01:52:35.881 --> 01:52:37.390
<v Speaker 1>very end of your intestines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2459
01:52:38.170 --> 01:52:43.170
<v Speaker 1>They're not supposed to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not supposed to have a bunch of </v>

2460
01:52:43.170 --> 01:52:44.761
<v Speaker 1>bacteria in your small intestine will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll swim up to the small intestine </v>

2461
01:52:44.761 --> 01:52:48.541
<v Speaker 1>because that's where the food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where the and the sugars and the </v>

2462
01:52:48.541 --> 01:52:51.410
<v Speaker 1>lipids are all getting absorbed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll swim up there and this is often </v>

2463
01:52:51.410 --> 01:52:54.851
<v Speaker 1>referred to as bacterial overgrowth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Small intestine bacterial overgrowth is </v>

2464
01:52:55.011 --> 01:53:00.011
<v Speaker 1>what the technical term is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bacterial overgrowth is actually when </v>

2465
01:53:00.011 --> 01:53:02.711
<v Speaker 1>your bacteria are starting to grow in </v>
<v Speaker 1>your small intestine and what happens is</v>

2466
01:53:03.560 --> 01:53:05.900
<v Speaker 1>when you have bacteria in your small </v>
<v Speaker 1>intestine,</v>

2467
01:53:06.200 --> 01:53:11.200
<v Speaker 1>it releases something called Zonulin and</v>
<v Speaker 1>this work has all been done by Eliseo </v>

2468
01:53:12.500 --> 01:53:17.500
<v Speaker 1>Fasano and he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he's at like Massachusetts </v>

2469
01:53:17.500 --> 01:53:17.660
<v Speaker 1>Children Hospital and he discovered this</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you know,</v>

2470
01:53:17.690 --> 01:53:19.130
<v Speaker 1>he's a rockstar for figuring this stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>

2471
01:53:19.131 --> 01:53:24.131
<v Speaker 1>but so when you have this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this intestinal overgrowth released </v>

2472
01:53:24.131 --> 01:53:24.131
<v Speaker 1>something called Zonulin.</v>

2473
01:53:24.131 --> 01:53:26.300
<v Speaker 1>Zonulin is also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are released when gluten,</v>

2474
01:53:26.450 --> 01:53:29.820
<v Speaker 1>when your body sees gluten Zonulin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2475
01:53:30.050 --> 01:53:35.050
<v Speaker 1>it literally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you have the gut barrier and </v>

2476
01:53:35.050 --> 01:53:35.050
<v Speaker 1>there's like these junctions with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>barrier,</v>

2477
01:53:35.050 --> 01:53:36.980
<v Speaker 1>it opens up the junctions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the tight junctions,</v>

2478
01:53:37.440 --> 01:53:40.910
<v Speaker 1>and then people that don't have like </v>
<v Speaker 1>Celiac or they don't have a really,</v>

2479
01:53:40.911 --> 01:53:42.800
<v Speaker 1>really poor gut health.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It closed.</v>

2480
01:53:42.801 --> 01:53:44.360
<v Speaker 1>It's like a transients like open,</v>
<v Speaker 1>close,</v>

2481
01:53:44.630 --> 01:53:45.200
<v Speaker 1>open,</v>
<v Speaker 1>close.</v>

2482
01:53:45.201 --> 01:53:50.201
<v Speaker 1>And so when they open,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your inflammatory cells can see the </v>

2483
01:53:50.201 --> 01:53:53.171
<v Speaker 1>bacteria that's there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Usually the barrier separates them </v>

2484
01:53:53.171 --> 01:53:56.411
<v Speaker 1>because what did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do immune cells do when they see </v>

2485
01:53:56.411 --> 01:53:59.771
<v Speaker 1>bacteria fire away?</v>
<v Speaker 1>More so the small intestinal bacterial </v>

2486
01:54:00.921 --> 01:54:05.921
<v Speaker 1>overgrowth does that and so does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so gluten gluten also causes Zonulin to </v>

2487
01:54:05.921 --> 01:54:06.290
<v Speaker 1>be released,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>

2488
01:54:06.291 --> 01:54:10.400
<v Speaker 1>so that would cause like bloating and </v>
<v Speaker 1>inflammation,</v>

2489
01:54:10.580 --> 01:54:11.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things like that.</v>

2490
01:54:12.670 --> 01:54:13.620
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

2491
01:54:13.640 --> 01:54:18.640
<v Speaker 1>it's just so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so crazy how much your diet </v>

2492
01:54:18.640 --> 01:54:22.390
<v Speaker 1>actually affects your overall health and</v>
<v Speaker 1>how few people really consider it when </v>

2493
01:54:22.390 --> 01:54:27.221
<v Speaker 1>they're thinking about what they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>eating and the consequences of what </v>

2494
01:54:27.221 --> 01:54:27.370
<v Speaker 1>they're eating and your brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what tastes good and your brand.</v>

2495
01:54:27.650 --> 01:54:29.230
<v Speaker 1>If it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2496
01:54:29.390 --> 01:54:33.140
<v Speaker 1>having low inflammation is key for your </v>
<v Speaker 1>brain.</v>

2497
01:54:33.200 --> 01:54:36.200
<v Speaker 1>All these different factors that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>playing on inside your body.</v>

2498
01:54:36.620 --> 01:54:38.720
<v Speaker 1>Like all this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

2499
01:54:38.960 --> 01:54:39.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2500
01:54:39.440 --> 01:54:44.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm eating a diet that's high in fiber.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the reasons why I </v>

2501
01:54:44.440 --> 01:54:49.091
<v Speaker 1>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I eat a lot of wide diversity because </v>

2502
01:54:49.091 --> 01:54:49.700
<v Speaker 1>there's lots of different types of </v>
<v Speaker 1>fiber.</v>

2503
01:54:49.750 --> 01:54:52.310
<v Speaker 1>There's you fibers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just like one nutrient,</v>

2504
01:54:52.340 --> 01:54:53.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people always treat at me,</v>

2505
01:54:53.481 --> 01:54:54.350
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can I take Pectin,</v>

2506
01:54:54.351 --> 01:54:56.570
<v Speaker 1>can I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can I take insulin and you know,</v>

2507
01:54:56.780 --> 01:54:57.980
<v Speaker 1>which is a type of fiber.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>

2508
01:54:57.981 --> 01:55:00.110
<v Speaker 1>well yeah you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

2509
01:55:00.200 --> 01:55:05.200
<v Speaker 1>these different types of bacteria.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So many different types of bacteria and </v>

2510
01:55:05.200 --> 01:55:08.560
<v Speaker 1>they are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're eating different types of fiber </v>

2511
01:55:08.560 --> 01:55:08.840
<v Speaker 1>and we don't even know all what each of </v>
<v Speaker 1>them are eating.</v>

2512
01:55:08.841 --> 01:55:13.841
<v Speaker 1>We just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know the best thing we can do right </v>

2513
01:55:13.841 --> 01:55:13.841
<v Speaker 1>now is to get a broad spectrum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2514
01:55:13.841 --> 01:55:17.040
<v Speaker 1>so there's fiber in the implants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's fiber that are called leggins </v>

2515
01:55:17.040 --> 01:55:17.060
<v Speaker 1>and cellulose.</v>

2516
01:55:17.520 --> 01:55:20.600
<v Speaker 1>I'm in fruits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's pectins like apple,</v>

2517
01:55:20.660 --> 01:55:23.510
<v Speaker 1>a citrus appeal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have pectins,</v>

2518
01:55:23.840 --> 01:55:26.090
<v Speaker 1>Beta glucans are and mushrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're an oats,</v>

2519
01:55:26.370 --> 01:55:29.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm resistant starches in legumes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>beans.</v>

2520
01:55:29.930 --> 01:55:33.020
<v Speaker 1>There's inulin which is in plants and </v>
<v Speaker 1>off like onions,</v>

2521
01:55:33.230 --> 01:55:34.400
<v Speaker 1>artichokes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>garlic,</v>

2522
01:55:34.700 --> 01:55:36.290
<v Speaker 1>and all these different types of fiber </v>
<v Speaker 1>feeding,</v>

2523
01:55:36.291 --> 01:55:41.291
<v Speaker 1>different types of factor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that best thing you want is a </v>

2524
01:55:41.291 --> 01:55:43.391
<v Speaker 1>diverse bacteria set.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So feeding them all different types of </v>

2525
01:55:43.391 --> 01:55:43.391
<v Speaker 1>fibers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>

2526
01:55:43.391 --> 01:55:47.050
<v Speaker 1>Plus you're getting all the plant </v>
<v Speaker 1>hormetic compounds and then you're </v>

2527
01:55:47.050 --> 01:55:47.050
<v Speaker 1>getting all the micronutrients,</v>
<v Speaker 1>magnesium,</v>

2528
01:55:47.050 --> 01:55:48.970
<v Speaker 1>vitaminK ,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm fully,</v>

2529
01:55:48.990 --> 01:55:50.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are things that people are in,</v>

2530
01:55:50.580 --> 01:55:51.870
<v Speaker 1>are deficient in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>

2531
01:55:51.970 --> 01:55:53.850
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I try to do that and then I eat meat.</v>

2532
01:55:54.150 --> 01:55:55.660
<v Speaker 1>I think there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2533
01:55:55.710 --> 01:55:56.360
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2534
01:55:56.540 --> 01:55:58.110
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now that I'm thinking about it,</v>

2535
01:55:58.160 --> 01:56:00.170
<v Speaker 3>I think it was kind of like an </v>
<v Speaker 3>infomercial,</v>

2536
01:56:00.600 --> 01:56:02.730
<v Speaker 3>what you're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm talking about the candida videos.</v>

2537
01:56:02.731 --> 01:56:07.731
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's exactly what they're selling a </v>

2538
01:56:07.731 --> 01:56:07.731
<v Speaker 3>product,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't think I made it that far.</v>

2539
01:56:07.731 --> 01:56:08.980
<v Speaker 3>It was long.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Five minutes.</v>

2540
01:56:09.070 --> 01:56:14.070
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was really long and it was </v>

2541
01:56:14.070 --> 01:56:14.070
<v Speaker 3>disturbing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2542
01:56:14.070 --> 01:56:15.390
<v Speaker 3>you're talking about Candida growth in </v>
<v Speaker 3>your stomach and how your,</v>

2543
01:56:15.400 --> 01:56:18.620
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>

2544

<v Speaker 3>massive.</v>

2545
01:56:22.260 --> 01:56:24.110
<v Speaker 3>Here it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's what happened.</v>

2546
01:56:24.120 --> 01:56:25.940
<v Speaker 3>Sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the cause of Candida,</v>

2547
01:56:26.270 --> 01:56:30.500
<v Speaker 3>Candida cause of cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And sugar has been shown,</v>

2548
01:56:30.501 --> 01:56:32.360
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to accelerate cancer growth.</v>

2549
01:56:32.570 --> 01:56:37.570
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact that there was a study that was </v>

2550
01:56:37.570 --> 01:56:40.691
<v Speaker 1>just published recently were like caused</v>
<v Speaker 1>breast cancer cells to grow like four </v>

2551
01:56:40.691 --> 01:56:40.940
<v Speaker 1>times faster.</v>

2552
01:56:41.250 --> 01:56:44.130
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Four times faster from sugar.</v>

2553
01:56:45.390 --> 01:56:48.060
<v Speaker 3>Refined sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not from my wife's mom.</v>

2554
01:56:48.530 --> 01:56:51.000
<v Speaker 3>She's a lovely lady,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she loves sugar.</v>

2555
01:56:51.001 --> 01:56:54.150
<v Speaker 3>She puts sugar in everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She makes Kale Salad and you eat it.</v>

2556
01:56:54.151 --> 01:56:55.230
<v Speaker 3>You'll like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're eating candy,</v>

2557
01:56:55.500 --> 01:56:56.760
<v Speaker 3>like everything has sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2558
01:56:56.761 --> 01:56:58.560
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like from her era,</v>

2559
01:56:58.740 --> 01:57:00.990
<v Speaker 3>that's what they did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They put sugar in their cornflakes,</v>

2560
01:57:01.050 --> 01:57:04.110
<v Speaker 3>everybody would sugar and everything and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they felt like it just made things taste</v>

2561
01:57:04.111 --> 01:57:09.111
<v Speaker 3>good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you're eating healthy food and </v>

2562
01:57:09.111 --> 01:57:09.111
<v Speaker 3>skittles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sugar on it,</v>

2563
01:57:09.111 --> 01:57:12.460
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go </v>

2564
01:57:12.460 --> 01:57:12.460
<v Speaker 3>down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Remember that?</v>

2565
01:57:12.460 --> 01:57:12.460
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2566
01:57:12.460 --> 01:57:16.731
<v Speaker 3>and it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so disturbing that people grow up </v>

2567
01:57:16.731 --> 01:57:18.570
<v Speaker 3>thinking that this is the way to eat and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just.</v>

2568
01:57:18.600 --> 01:57:21.090
<v Speaker 3>Nobody told them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nobody warned them and you know,</v>

2569
01:57:21.300 --> 01:57:24.720
<v Speaker 3>she's in her sixties now and that's just</v>
<v Speaker 3>how it goes to the autonomous.</v>

2570
01:57:24.721 --> 01:57:27.380
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's fucking</v>

2571
01:57:27.590 --> 01:57:28.160
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

<v Speaker 1>loved ones that I care about that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>also addicted to sugar and I try try </v>

2574
01:57:35.511 --> 01:57:36.830
<v Speaker 1>hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2575
01:57:36.850 --> 01:57:37.730
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is hard.</v>

2576
01:57:37.731 --> 01:57:40.580
<v Speaker 1>Especially the older you get when you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuck in your ways,</v>

2577
01:57:40.610 --> 01:57:44.150
<v Speaker 1>your brain's not as able to kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>change as easily,</v>

2578
01:57:44.151 --> 01:57:44.890
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we'll see.</v>

<v Speaker 1>So you</v>

2580
01:57:45.010 --> 01:57:50.010
<v Speaker 3>don't have a lot of willpower.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some people just not good at like </v>

2581
01:57:50.010 --> 01:57:50.010
<v Speaker 3>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2582
01:57:50.010 --> 01:57:51.040
<v Speaker 3>this is what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not doing this anymore,</v>

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like this,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Boom,</v>

2585
01:57:53.890 --> 01:57:58.890
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how other people's brains </v>

2586
01:57:58.890 --> 01:57:58.890
<v Speaker 3>work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I don't.</v>

2587
01:57:58.890 --> 01:58:02.191
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what the pull is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I know for me when when I try to </v>

2588
01:58:02.191 --> 01:58:02.960
<v Speaker 3>quit something like I'm going to quit </v>
<v Speaker 3>sugar,</v>

01:58:02.961 --> 01:58:03.760
<v Speaker 3>I'm there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Boy,</v>

2590
01:58:03.761 --> 01:58:07.930
<v Speaker 3>that fucking first week or so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was hard because the pole,</v>

2591
01:58:08.110 --> 01:58:10.630
<v Speaker 3>it's like there's this desire to cheap </v>
<v Speaker 3>go.</v>

2592
01:58:10.631 --> 01:58:12.060
<v Speaker 3>Come on man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one cookies,</v>

2593
01:58:12.070 --> 01:58:14.350
<v Speaker 3>not going to fuck anything up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not going to be that big a deal.</v>

2594
01:58:14.560 --> 01:58:18.670
<v Speaker 3>Like there's this poll to have sugar and</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I kicked sugar for,</v>

2595
01:58:18.820 --> 01:58:21.100
<v Speaker 3>I've done it twice now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the first time I did it,</v>

2596
01:58:21.140 --> 01:58:23.230
<v Speaker 3>one of the most disturbing things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was like the headaches,</v>

2597
01:58:23.530 --> 01:58:25.570
<v Speaker 3>like two or three days in I was getting </v>
<v Speaker 3>these headaches.</v>

2598
01:58:25.620 --> 01:58:26.830
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God,</v>

2599
01:58:27.070 --> 01:58:30.520
<v Speaker 3>I'm getting sugar detox headaches.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that's what it was.</v>

2600
01:58:30.521 --> 01:58:35.521
<v Speaker 3>It had to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was the only thing that was </v>

2601
01:58:35.521 --> 01:58:35.521
<v Speaker 3>different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was eating all the same normal things,</v>

2602
01:58:35.521 --> 01:58:36.400
<v Speaker 3>but I wasn't taking any sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anything that has sugar,</v>

2603
01:58:36.580 --> 01:58:41.580
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't take it and I was getting </v>
<v Speaker 3>headaches it on most people if you don't</v>

2604
01:58:42.281 --> 01:58:47.281
<v Speaker 3>get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you don't have a rock solid </v>

2605
01:58:47.281 --> 01:58:48.400
<v Speaker 3>determined mentality for this type of </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff,</v>

2606
01:58:48.430 --> 01:58:51.670
<v Speaker 3>it's really hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if you're wishy washy on your diet.</v>

2607
01:58:51.671 --> 01:58:52.990
<v Speaker 3>Well I'm just going to try to eat </v>
<v Speaker 3>healthy.</v>

2608
01:58:53.100 --> 01:58:55.540
<v Speaker 3>Like my friends have told me that before</v>
<v Speaker 3>they try to lose weight.</v>

2609
01:58:55.680 --> 01:58:57.670
<v Speaker 3>What are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just going to try to eat healthier.</v>

2610
01:58:57.920 --> 01:59:00.010
<v Speaker 3>You Ain't gonna do shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You Ain't gonna do shit.</v>

2611
01:59:00.070 --> 01:59:02.710
<v Speaker 3>Like you have to have like a rigid set </v>
<v Speaker 3>of rules.</v>

2612
01:59:02.711 --> 01:59:07.711
<v Speaker 3>You can't say I'm just going to eat </v>
<v Speaker 3>healthy because then you'll decide </v>

2613
01:59:07.711 --> 01:59:11.641
<v Speaker 3>you're eating healthy back fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>cupcake's not gonna hurt anybody and </v>

2614
01:59:11.641 --> 01:59:12.100
<v Speaker 3>then you'll eat that cupcake and that'll</v>
<v Speaker 3>kill all your hard work.</v>

2615
01:59:12.970 --> 01:59:16.780
<v Speaker 3>I had no idea that you were eating </v>
<v Speaker 3>refined sugar like this whole time.</v>

2616
01:59:16.781 --> 01:59:20.590
<v Speaker 3>I thought you were.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're always like vegetables.</v>

2617
01:59:20.800 --> 01:59:22.170
<v Speaker 3>Meat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2618
01:59:22.190 --> 01:59:24.220
<v Speaker 3>I would occasionally I would dive in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2619
01:59:24.221 --> 01:59:29.221
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't like a real problem,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was enough that see if you eat </v>

2620
01:59:29.221 --> 01:59:30.970
<v Speaker 3>protein bars like the ones that Jamie </v>
<v Speaker 3>was eating over there,</v>

2621
01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:33.010
<v Speaker 3>what does that have it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love those goddamn things.</v>

2622
01:59:35.200 --> 01:59:37.000
<v Speaker 3>These things are great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They taste awesome.</v>

2623
01:59:37.001 --> 01:59:42.001
<v Speaker 3>They're called pro bars.</v>

<v Speaker 3>It's hidden everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is.</v>

01:59:52.730 --> 01:59:56.170
<v Speaker 3>God damn crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is 21 grams.</v>

2631
01:59:56.410 --> 01:59:58.060
<v Speaker 3>You're always supposed to have 25 in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>day.</v>

2632
01:59:58.080 --> 01:59:59.080
<v Speaker 3>Yep,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

2633
01:59:59.081 --> 02:00:04.081
<v Speaker 3>A whole day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One yummy bar fucker is Alex your added </v>

2634
02:00:05.801 --> 02:00:08.410
<v Speaker 3>sugar fighting two or three of those in </v>
<v Speaker 3>a setting.</v>

2635
02:00:08.650 --> 02:00:10.780
<v Speaker 3>Like after I worked out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would eat two of those.</v>

2636
02:00:10.900 --> 02:00:13.870
<v Speaker 3>Like if I was going to in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I was headed over here and uh,</v>

2637
02:00:13.871 --> 02:00:17.230
<v Speaker 3>I didn't have time to eat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd throw to those down and a Kombucha.</v>

2638
02:00:17.350 --> 02:00:20.020
<v Speaker 3>So the Kombucha,</v>
<v Speaker 3>John Ten 10?</v>

2639
02:00:20.021 --> 02:00:21.520
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For grape grape cappuccinos.</v>

2640
02:00:21.550 --> 02:00:23.890
<v Speaker 3>10 plane has five.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

2641
02:00:23.891 --> 02:00:25.130
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I prefer plane,</v>

2642
02:00:25.150 --> 02:00:26.920
<v Speaker 3>but sometimes the grape was all.</v>

2643
02:00:26.920 --> 02:00:31.920
<v Speaker 3>I had left,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I'd throw it out a grape that's 10 a </v>

2644
02:00:31.920 --> 02:00:31.920
<v Speaker 3>throw down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two of those.</v>

2645
02:00:31.920 --> 02:00:33.610
<v Speaker 3>That's 41 or 42.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ,</v>

2646
02:00:33.611 --> 02:00:36.550
<v Speaker 3>I mean 50 grams of sugar on the way over</v>
<v Speaker 3>here,</v>

2647
02:00:36.850 --> 02:00:38.710
<v Speaker 3>which is twice what you're supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 3>have in a day.</v>

2648
02:00:38.830 --> 02:00:41.380
<v Speaker 3>And then I might have a piece of cake,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2649
02:00:41.381 --> 02:00:44.750
<v Speaker 3>I'm to eat real healthy and say I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>eating real healthy and you know,</v>

2650
02:00:45.100 --> 02:00:48.070
<v Speaker 3>oh you want some apple pie folk?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you want ice cream on it?</v>

2651
02:00:48.100 --> 02:00:49.960
<v Speaker 3>Why not?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then what's that?</v>

2652
02:00:49.961 --> 02:00:51.970
<v Speaker 3>It's probably another 30,</v>
<v Speaker 3>40,</v>

2653
02:00:51.971 --> 02:00:52.930
<v Speaker 3>50,</v>
<v Speaker 3>60,</v>

2654
02:00:52.931 --> 02:00:56.980
<v Speaker 3>70.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you're winding up with 100 plus grams</v>

2655
02:00:57.160 --> 02:00:59.290
<v Speaker 3>of sugar in a day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2656
02:00:59.470 --> 02:01:00.100
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this,</v>

2657
02:01:00.130 --> 02:01:05.130
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this stuff is causing inflammation in </v>

2658
02:01:05.130 --> 02:01:05.130
<v Speaker 3>your gut.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the more,</v>

2659
02:01:05.130 --> 02:01:09.301
<v Speaker 3>at least with you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you were still getting some of the good </v>

2660
02:01:09.301 --> 02:01:11.161
<v Speaker 3>stuff though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not like you were eating a fiber </v>

2661
02:01:11.161 --> 02:01:11.161
<v Speaker 3>deficient diet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2662
02:01:11.161 --> 02:01:11.740
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was eating healthy on top of that,</v>

2663
02:01:11.770 --> 02:01:13.660
<v Speaker 3>but even better than.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2664
02:01:13.780 --> 02:01:15.880
<v Speaker 3>Than most people that are eating that </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>

2665
02:01:17.980 --> 02:01:19.540
<v Speaker 3>This is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>

2666
02:01:19.541 --> 02:01:22.120
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a thing called a Lara bar.</v>

2667
02:01:22.130 --> 02:01:23.260
<v Speaker 3>You ever heard lar?</v>
<v Speaker 3>A.</v>

2668
02:01:23.261 --> 02:01:25.180
<v Speaker 3>They're so yummy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're so good,</v>

2669
02:01:25.181 --> 02:01:26.950
<v Speaker 3>but it makes it look like you're eating </v>
<v Speaker 3>something healthy.</v>

2670
02:01:27.100 --> 02:01:30.970
<v Speaker 3>It's like the wrappings earth toned.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like woo.</v>

2671
02:01:30.971 --> 02:01:33.010
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm doing yoga in a bar.</v>

2672
02:01:33.220 --> 02:01:38.220
<v Speaker 3>This is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most of those bars are really candy </v>

2673
02:01:38.220 --> 02:01:38.220
<v Speaker 3>bars,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

2674
02:01:38.780 --> 02:01:40.400
<v Speaker 3>I think quest nutrition</v>

2675
02:01:40.460 --> 02:01:45.460
<v Speaker 1>is probably like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I were to say that there's anyone </v>

2676
02:01:45.460 --> 02:01:46.640
<v Speaker 1>that makes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes a bar that's not a candy bar.</v>

2677
02:01:46.641 --> 02:01:49.070
<v Speaker 1>Quest quest has some decent ones.</v>

2678
02:01:49.180 --> 02:01:49.860
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2679
02:01:49.900 --> 02:01:54.900
<v Speaker 2>primal kitchens has a really good one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a nut bar with dark chocolate and </v>

2680
02:01:55.391 --> 02:01:58.960
<v Speaker 2>it has a tiny amount of honey in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's less than four grams.</v>

2681
02:01:59.360 --> 02:02:02.650
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure less than four grams of </v>
<v Speaker 2>sugar per bar,</v>

2682
02:02:02.890 --> 02:02:05.650
<v Speaker 2>but it's mostly almonds and dark </v>
<v Speaker 2>chocolate.</v>

2683
02:02:05.800 --> 02:02:07.900
<v Speaker 2>Like a little bit of honey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are really good.</v>

2684
02:02:07.930 --> 02:02:09.730
<v Speaker 2>They're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not sweet at all.</v>

2685
02:02:09.940 --> 02:02:14.680
<v Speaker 2>Those I liked those and a lot of times </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll eat like a meat bars.</v>

2686
02:02:14.710 --> 02:02:17.050
<v Speaker 2>Like there's some bars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are the ones we have back there?</v>

2693
02:02:28.240 --> 02:02:30.310

<v Speaker 2>sugar in them.</v>

2694
02:02:30.580 --> 02:02:33.550
<v Speaker 2>It's just amazing how sneaky they are.</v>

2704
02:02:57.800 --> 02:03:00.430
<v Speaker 1>The uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lab that I was doing my postdoc in,</v>

2705
02:03:00.490 --> 02:03:01.060
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

2706
02:03:01.170 --> 02:03:02.270
<v Speaker 1>I've talked about this before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

2707
02:03:02.271 --> 02:03:03.370
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they made it,</v>

2708
02:03:03.410 --> 02:03:08.410
<v Speaker 1>they designed a bard intentionally to </v>
<v Speaker 1>try and fill new micro nutrient gaps in </v>

2709
02:03:08.410 --> 02:03:10.700
<v Speaker 1>people that are like obese.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like it has,</v>

2710
02:03:10.701 --> 02:03:12.210
<v Speaker 1>it has vitamin D in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2711
02:03:12.220 --> 02:03:15.350
<v Speaker 1>it has magnesium,</v>
<v Speaker 1>vitaminK has Dha,</v>

2712
02:03:15.351 --> 02:03:20.351
<v Speaker 1>Omega three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has all these good micronutrients in </v>

2713
02:03:20.351 --> 02:03:22.421
<v Speaker 1>it and then they try to put some dark </v>
<v Speaker 1>chocolate so that doesn't taste like </v>

2714
02:03:22.421 --> 02:03:22.421
<v Speaker 1>crap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2715
02:03:22.700 --> 02:03:25.940
<v Speaker 1>and sprinkle a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's very little sugar in it,</v>

2716
02:03:25.941 --> 02:03:28.160
<v Speaker 1>but you know people don't like them </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they don't taste good.</v>

2717
02:03:28.250 --> 02:03:32.350
<v Speaker 1>This little fucker as 22,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this little crazy you shouldn't eat.</v>

<v Speaker 1>This little tiny thing is 22.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Imagine how many people are eating this </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

2720
02:03:38.600 --> 02:03:43.400
<v Speaker 1>Sugar just fucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the best thing you can do is eat</v>

2721
02:03:43.790 --> 02:03:44.660
<v Speaker 1>whole foods.</v>

02:03:44.660 --> 02:03:46.550
<v Speaker 1>You can eat vegetables,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2723
02:03:46.551 --> 02:03:49.190
<v Speaker 1>fruits are not that bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can eat a pear and apple.</v>

<v Speaker 1>These plant insecticides,</v>

2727
02:03:56.800 --> 02:04:00.080
<v Speaker 1>they've got fiber,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've got some micronutrients and they</v>

2728
02:04:00.081 --> 02:04:02.840
<v Speaker 1>taste really good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They taste good like a peach,</v>

2739
02:04:27.670 --> 02:04:27.740
<v Speaker 1>fact that we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're eating something,</v>

2740
02:04:27.741 --> 02:04:32.741
<v Speaker 1>we're getting like the mouth pleasure </v>
<v Speaker 1>from it and we're also getting the </v>

2741
02:04:32.741 --> 02:04:32.741
<v Speaker 1>naughtiness like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ooo,</v>

2742
02:04:32.741 --> 02:04:33.110
<v Speaker 1>the cake.</v>

2743
02:04:34.460 --> 02:04:36.950
<v Speaker 1>How much of that is a learned response </v>
<v Speaker 1>as well?</v>

2744
02:04:36.951 --> 02:04:38.450
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

2745
02:04:38.650 --> 02:04:43.320
<v Speaker 1>my postdoc advisor or Bruce Ames,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's 87 years old,</v>

2746
02:04:43.620 --> 02:04:48.620
<v Speaker 1>going on 88 and I've been to many </v>
<v Speaker 1>different dinner parties at his house </v>

2747
02:04:48.620 --> 02:04:52.731
<v Speaker 1>and he's American and his wife is </v>
<v Speaker 1>Italian so she immigrated here from </v>

2748
02:04:52.731 --> 02:04:57.021
<v Speaker 1>Italy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But every single time I go to a dinner </v>

2749
02:04:57.021 --> 02:05:00.861
<v Speaker 1>party the dessert is always fresh fruit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's just like super normal,</v>

2750
02:05:00.901 --> 02:05:02.550
<v Speaker 1>like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's always fresh.</v>

2751
02:05:02.551 --> 02:05:07.551
<v Speaker 1>Some sort of fresh fruit medley.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She'll cut up and sometimes she'll put </v>

2752
02:05:07.551 --> 02:05:09.120
<v Speaker 1>some little bit of some alcohol or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something on there.</v>

2753
02:05:09.420 --> 02:05:11.430
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm moretto or you know,</v>

2754
02:05:11.431 --> 02:05:13.470
<v Speaker 1>but it's always fresh fruit and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2755
02:05:13.920 --> 02:05:16.560
<v Speaker 1>they've been doing this for 50 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's been their dessert.</v>

2756
02:05:17.010 --> 02:05:18.090
<v Speaker 1>Fresh fruit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

2757
02:05:18.330 --> 02:05:20.970
<v Speaker 1>So that was good though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's good.</v>

2758
02:05:20.971 --> 02:05:22.650
<v Speaker 1>Chocolate cake is better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dark,</v>

2759
02:05:22.660 --> 02:05:27.660
<v Speaker 1>dark chocolate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dark chocolate has a lot of good stuff </v>

2760
02:05:27.660 --> 02:05:27.660
<v Speaker 1>in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

2761
02:05:27.660 --> 02:05:28.440
<v Speaker 1>So that the dark,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dark chocolates.</v>

2762
02:05:28.441 --> 02:05:33.441
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that people that are really </v>

2763
02:05:33.441 --> 02:05:33.441
<v Speaker 1>craving that can can feel good because </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

2764
02:05:33.441 --> 02:05:36.390
<v Speaker 1>there's ecg and dark chocolate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is what's in green tea.</v>

2765
02:05:36.660 --> 02:05:41.660
<v Speaker 1>UGC is one of those normal plant </v>
<v Speaker 1>compounds that are doing a a hormetic </v>

2766
02:05:41.660 --> 02:05:46.221
<v Speaker 1>response.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's been shown to cause brain cells to </v>

2767
02:05:46.221 --> 02:05:46.221
<v Speaker 1>grow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's anti cancer,</v>

2768
02:05:46.221 --> 02:05:47.820
<v Speaker 1>it kills cancer cells.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It also is really good for your skin,</v>

2769
02:05:48.540 --> 02:05:51.390
<v Speaker 1>prevents your skin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Collagen is being broken down and it has</v>

2770
02:05:51.391 --> 02:05:54.510
<v Speaker 1>a really high reading of antioxidants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2771
02:05:54.870 --> 02:05:56.430
<v Speaker 1>Well that's what I'm talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These,</v>

2772
02:05:56.630 --> 02:06:01.200
<v Speaker 1>they're not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People get confused antioxidants.</v>

2773
02:06:01.500 --> 02:06:05.970
<v Speaker 1>There are antioxidants in fruits and </v>
<v Speaker 1>vegetables,</v>

2774
02:06:06.390 --> 02:06:11.390
<v Speaker 1>but in dark chocolate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the antioxidants are the hormetic </v>

2775
02:06:11.390 --> 02:06:15.051
<v Speaker 1>compounds that are causing your </v>
<v Speaker 1>antioxidant genes to be expressed is a </v>

2776
02:06:15.051 --> 02:06:17.640
<v Speaker 1>big difference and there's really like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no comparison.</v>

2777
02:06:17.641 --> 02:06:19.500
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2778
02:06:19.501 --> 02:06:22.260
<v Speaker 1>you need a certain amount of vitamin E </v>
<v Speaker 1>which has antioxidant,</v>

2779
02:06:22.261 --> 02:06:25.970
<v Speaker 1>you need a certain amount of vitamin C </v>
<v Speaker 1>which is an antioxidant and a cofactor.</v>

2780
02:06:26.030 --> 02:06:30.720
<v Speaker 1>You need it to make Collagen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in just like the antioxidant form,</v>

2781
02:06:30.721 --> 02:06:33.840
<v Speaker 1>it pales in comparison to like </v>
<v Speaker 1>glutathione related enzymes.</v>

2782
02:06:33.841 --> 02:06:38.841
<v Speaker 1>We have super oxide dismutase.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All these systems that we have in our </v>

2783
02:06:38.841 --> 02:06:43.071
<v Speaker 1>body that are designed to prevent these </v>
<v Speaker 1>things called oxidation or oxidative </v>

2784
02:06:43.741 --> 02:06:45.000
<v Speaker 1>stress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stress from happening.</v>

2785
02:06:45.300 --> 02:06:47.550
<v Speaker 1>So when you're taking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in fact some people,</v>

2786
02:06:47.551 --> 02:06:49.940
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have a uh,</v>

2787
02:06:50.620 --> 02:06:54.000
<v Speaker 1>so we have this gene that can use </v>
<v Speaker 1>glutathione in our body,</v>

2788
02:06:54.001 --> 02:06:59.001
<v Speaker 1>takes the glutathione that we make in </v>
<v Speaker 1>our body and it puts it to like prevent </v>

2789
02:06:59.001 --> 02:07:03.210
<v Speaker 1>damage from happening to ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are people that have more.</v>

2790
02:07:03.430 --> 02:07:08.430
<v Speaker 1>I'm more active version of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that if they take vitamin D </v>

2791
02:07:08.430 --> 02:07:08.880
<v Speaker 1>supplemental,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it actually does them harm.</v>

2792
02:07:09.630 --> 02:07:10.440
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2793
02:07:10.470 --> 02:07:13.380
<v Speaker 1>Because that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because what happens is the body goes,</v>

2794
02:07:13.410 --> 02:07:14.730
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got this vitamin E,</v>

2795
02:07:14.731 --> 02:07:19.731
<v Speaker 1>it's doing that job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the enzyme doesn't get active </v>

2796
02:07:19.731 --> 02:07:21.540
<v Speaker 1>when you have the stress there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the enzymes not active.</v>

2797
02:07:21.830 --> 02:07:26.220
<v Speaker 1>This is a certain gene polymorphism in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the GSTP one gene.</v>

2798
02:07:26.370 --> 02:07:27.670
<v Speaker 1>So how would someone find that out </v>
<v Speaker 1>there?</v>

2799
02:07:27.680 --> 02:07:29.940
<v Speaker 1>What they have to have 23 and me 23 and </v>
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>

2800
02:07:30.170 --> 02:07:35.170
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a genetic test that tests for a </v>

2801
02:07:35.170 --> 02:07:35.910
<v Speaker 1>variety of these polymorphisms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

2802
02:07:35.950 --> 02:07:37.780
<v Speaker 1>there's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they give a,</v>

2803
02:07:37.781 --> 02:07:40.840
<v Speaker 1>a report that's kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't tell you about that gene.</v>

2804
02:07:40.841 --> 02:07:42.290
<v Speaker 1>You have to like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2805
02:07:42.700 --> 02:07:47.700
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if promethium promethium </v>

2806
02:07:47.700 --> 02:07:47.770
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a tool that's like it costs $5.</v>

2807
02:07:47.771 --> 02:07:52.771
<v Speaker 1>I've talked about it before in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast and you can run your 23 and me </v>

2808
02:07:52.771 --> 02:07:53.710
<v Speaker 1>data through it and it tells you all </v>
<v Speaker 1>these polymorphisms,</v>

2809
02:07:53.711 --> 02:07:55.660
<v Speaker 1>but that what you have and what they </v>
<v Speaker 1>mean.</v>

2810
02:07:55.661 --> 02:07:58.030
<v Speaker 1>But I also have a tool that's out today </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually,</v>

2811
02:07:58.210 --> 02:07:59.620
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a,</v>

2812
02:07:59.960 --> 02:08:01.660
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the Beta version of it,</v>

2813
02:08:01.661 --> 02:08:03.520
<v Speaker 1>so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's basic functionality,</v>

2814
02:08:03.521 --> 02:08:08.521
<v Speaker 1>but that genes on there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the GSTP one glitter found one is on </v>

2815
02:08:08.521 --> 02:08:08.521
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

2816
02:08:08.521 --> 02:08:08.521
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2817
02:08:08.521 --> 02:08:12.760
<v Speaker 1>this tool that I've got out is free so </v>
<v Speaker 1>people can use it for free and I'm going</v>

2818
02:08:12.761 --> 02:08:15.610
<v Speaker 1>to add a bunch more genes to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but right now there's a,</v>

2819
02:08:15.611 --> 02:08:19.270
<v Speaker 1>there's a basic set of genes that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>interested in genes that are involved in</v>

2820
02:08:19.950 --> 02:08:22.790
<v Speaker 1>making vitamin D.</v>
<v Speaker 1>can you convert the vitamin D three?</v>

2821
02:08:22.791 --> 02:08:26.530
<v Speaker 1>You're taking into the steroid hormone </v>
<v Speaker 1>or vitamin D three you get from the sun.</v>

2822
02:08:26.650 --> 02:08:28.960
<v Speaker 1>Some people have a polymorphism where </v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't do that as well.</v>

2823
02:08:29.170 --> 02:08:30.370
<v Speaker 1>There it is right there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there it is.</v>

2824
02:08:30.530 --> 02:08:33.430
<v Speaker 1>Rhonda is genetic report and this.com</v>
<v Speaker 1>forward slash genetics.</v>

2825
02:08:34.560 --> 02:08:39.560
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing to me that every time you </v>
<v Speaker 3>come on the podcast there's new shit </v>

2826
02:08:39.560 --> 02:08:41.760
<v Speaker 3>that I have to remember and it seems </v>
<v Speaker 3>like you're constantly learning things.</v>

2827
02:08:41.880 --> 02:08:44.640
<v Speaker 3>That's what's crazy is that you've been </v>
<v Speaker 3>studying this for so long,</v>

2828
02:08:44.880 --> 02:08:46.950
<v Speaker 3>but it's just you're at the tip of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>iceberg.</v>

2829
02:08:46.980 --> 02:08:48.780
<v Speaker 3>It seems like there's no end of this.</v>

2830
02:08:48.990 --> 02:08:52.350
<v Speaker 1>There's no end and we need crispr so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I can keep learning.</v>

2831
02:08:52.351 --> 02:08:56.030
<v Speaker 1>It's like infinite amount.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I have</v>

2832
02:08:56.300 --> 02:08:57.860
<v Speaker 3>crispr for people don't know what that </v>
<v Speaker 3>means.</v>

2833
02:08:57.861 --> 02:09:01.730
<v Speaker 3>It's a relatively new method of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of altering genetic.</v>

2834
02:09:01.740 --> 02:09:06.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to give the thousand mile </v>
<v Speaker 1>summary of it where it's basically a way</v>

2835
02:09:06.960 --> 02:09:11.580
<v Speaker 1>to to go and fix a gene that may be </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2836
02:09:11.581 --> 02:09:14.130
<v Speaker 1>let's say you've got some gene that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't repair,</v>

2837
02:09:14.280 --> 02:09:17.700
<v Speaker 1>you know the alcohol damage induced </v>
<v Speaker 1>damage as well,</v>

2838
02:09:17.701 --> 02:09:21.120
<v Speaker 1>which also increases the risk for </v>
<v Speaker 1>traumatic brain injury by like tenfold.</v>

2839
02:09:21.420 --> 02:09:23.070
<v Speaker 1>It's bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you say,</v>

2840
02:09:23.071 --> 02:09:28.071
<v Speaker 1>I don't want that apoe e four gene </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's gonna lead to Alzheimer's </v>

2841
02:09:28.071 --> 02:09:31.431
<v Speaker 1>disease.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to make my traumatic brain </v>

2842
02:09:31.431 --> 02:09:31.431
<v Speaker 1>injury lead to Alzheimer's disease.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2843
02:09:31.431 --> 02:09:32.940
<v Speaker 1>it's so and also does other things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2844
02:09:32.941 --> 02:09:37.941
<v Speaker 1>crispr is a technology that can go and </v>
<v Speaker 1>recognize the gene you want so it </v>

2845
02:09:39.201 --> 02:09:42.720
<v Speaker 1>recognize it's just a small sequence of </v>
<v Speaker 1>DNA that you put on it.</v>

2846
02:09:42.721 --> 02:09:47.721
<v Speaker 1>So you put this little sequence of Dna </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you know what the sequence of </v>

2847
02:09:47.721 --> 02:09:49.740
<v Speaker 1>the gene is and it recognizes it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>complimentary pair and it goes in and it</v>

2848
02:09:49.741 --> 02:09:53.190
<v Speaker 1>cuts it out and it replaces it with what</v>
<v Speaker 1>you actually put there,</v>

2849
02:09:53.191 --> 02:09:58.191
<v Speaker 1>which is the right version of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it can like go cut out a bad thing </v>

2850
02:09:58.191 --> 02:10:02.061
<v Speaker 1>and put the right thing in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a way of going instead of gene </v>

2851
02:10:02.221 --> 02:10:07.221
<v Speaker 1>engineering up until Crispr,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way it was done was basically you </v>

2852
02:10:07.221 --> 02:10:11.130
<v Speaker 1>would put a gene in and it will just go </v>
<v Speaker 1>anywhere and it wouldn't replace the bad</v>

2853
02:10:11.131 --> 02:10:15.180
<v Speaker 1>one necessarily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is Kinda like a whole new field.</v>

2854
02:10:15.300 --> 02:10:16.080
<v Speaker 1>It's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like.</v>

2855
02:10:16.920 --> 02:10:17.550
<v Speaker 1>So anyways.</v>

2856
02:10:17.650 --> 02:10:22.650
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's a radiolab podcast on that </v>

2857
02:10:22.650 --> 02:10:22.650
<v Speaker 3>as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's spelled C,</v>

2858
02:10:22.650 --> 02:10:23.260
<v Speaker 3>R I s P,</v>
<v Speaker 3>R.</v>

2859
02:10:23.260 --> 02:10:25.570
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you're interested in listening to</v>

2860
02:10:25.600 --> 02:10:30.600
<v Speaker 3>Radiolab podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's amazing and it's also </v>

2861
02:10:30.600 --> 02:10:30.600
<v Speaker 3>interviews of people who discovered it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And.</v>

2862
02:10:30.600 --> 02:10:30.980
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jennifer,</v>

2863
02:10:30.990 --> 02:10:32.960
<v Speaker 1>do you see Berkeley?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2864
02:10:33.020 --> 02:10:34.010
<v Speaker 1>I listened to some of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's</v>

2865
02:10:34.010 --> 02:10:39.010
<v Speaker 3>good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the job really good job </v>

2866
02:10:39.010 --> 02:10:39.110
<v Speaker 3>explaining it to people so that they can</v>
<v Speaker 3>understand.</v>

2867
02:10:39.370 --> 02:10:44.370
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to talk for a little bit about </v>

2868
02:10:44.370 --> 02:10:46.420
<v Speaker 3>the cryotherapy because this is </v>
<v Speaker 3>something that I emailed you when there </v>

2869
02:10:46.420 --> 02:10:49.181
<v Speaker 3>was a disturbing article that was sort </v>
<v Speaker 3>of Poo pooing the benefits cryotherapy </v>

2870
02:10:49.181 --> 02:10:49.820
<v Speaker 3>in the article was I thought it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>really poorly,</v>

2871
02:10:50.120 --> 02:10:52.280
<v Speaker 3>poorly done,</v>
<v Speaker 3>poorly researched.</v>

2872
02:10:52.550 --> 02:10:57.550
<v Speaker 3>And it was also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was studied really subjective things </v>

2873
02:10:57.550 --> 02:11:02.321
<v Speaker 3>like how sore you felt after exercise </v>
<v Speaker 3>and whether or not a benefited for them </v>

2874
02:11:02.321 --> 02:11:03.140
<v Speaker 3>from that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

2875
02:11:03.320 --> 02:11:08.320
<v Speaker 3>but there are real positive benefits of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Cryo therapy that are measurable.</v>

2876
02:11:09.470 --> 02:11:11.360
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that happened as well,</v>

2877
02:11:11.361 --> 02:11:16.361
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that article that you're referring to </v>

2878
02:11:16.361 --> 02:11:18.791
<v Speaker 3>from that whatever website it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the article was Steven Novella is a </v>

2879
02:11:18.861 --> 02:11:23.861
<v Speaker 3>guy and I think what he did is he rushed</v>
<v Speaker 3>to put this article out because that </v>

2880
02:11:23.861 --> 02:11:27.750
<v Speaker 3>woman died in Las Vegas from Cryo </v>
<v Speaker 3>therapy and it was a really tragic </v>

2881
02:11:27.750 --> 02:11:27.750
<v Speaker 3>incident.</v>

2882
02:11:27.750 --> 02:11:32.350
<v Speaker 3>She was by herself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's two different types of cryo </v>

2883
02:11:32.350 --> 02:11:32.350
<v Speaker 3>therapy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the things we should point out,</v>

2884
02:11:32.350 --> 02:11:36.730
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have any because I've been </v>

2885
02:11:36.730 --> 02:11:38.981
<v Speaker 3>accused of this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was just say right now I don't have </v>

2886
02:11:38.981 --> 02:11:38.981
<v Speaker 3>any vested interest in cryotherapy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't own any of it.</v>

2887
02:11:38.981 --> 02:11:40.640
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't make any money from it.</v>

2888
02:11:40.820 --> 02:11:43.760
<v Speaker 3>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I enjoy the benefits of it and I use it,</v>

2889
02:11:44.060 --> 02:11:46.850
<v Speaker 3>but this woman who did it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she did the type.</v>

2890
02:11:46.880 --> 02:11:48.230
<v Speaker 3>There's two kinds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of them,</v>

2891
02:11:48.231 --> 02:11:50.990
<v Speaker 3>it goes from the neck down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you stand in this booth.</v>

2892
02:11:51.020 --> 02:11:53.270
<v Speaker 3>Your head is above breathing and normal </v>
<v Speaker 3>oxygen,</v>

2893
02:11:53.271 --> 02:11:56.960
<v Speaker 3>but below you is liquid nitrogen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't read that stuff in.</v>

2894
02:11:56.961 --> 02:12:00.200
<v Speaker 3>That's why your head is not under.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you do breathe that stuff in,</v>

2895
02:12:00.500 --> 02:12:05.500
<v Speaker 3>you don't have any oxygen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'll black out and that's what </v>

2896
02:12:05.500 --> 02:12:05.500
<v Speaker 3>happened to her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She did it by herself.</v>

2897
02:12:05.500 --> 02:12:10.000
<v Speaker 3>It was poorly set up and apparently she </v>
<v Speaker 3>was quite short so her head was kind of </v>

2898
02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:12.190
<v Speaker 3>below the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2899
02:12:12.220 --> 02:12:13.750
<v Speaker 3>the limit where you're supposed to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>with.</v>

2900
02:12:13.760 --> 02:12:17.750
<v Speaker 3>So she was breathing in the liquid </v>
<v Speaker 3>nitrogen and she fell asleep and blacked</v>

2901
02:12:17.751 --> 02:12:21.760
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I thought she was full on.</v>

2902
02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:22.220
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2903
02:12:22.221 --> 02:12:25.010
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The full on ones are much rarer.</v>

2904
02:12:25.310 --> 02:12:30.080
<v Speaker 3>And what the full on ones do is they </v>
<v Speaker 3>super cool the air with the nitrogen.</v>

2905
02:12:30.230 --> 02:12:33.570
<v Speaker 3>So the air itself is pumped in really </v>
<v Speaker 3>cool.</v>

2906
02:12:33.650 --> 02:12:34.450
<v Speaker 3>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2907
02:12:34.490 --> 02:12:39.490
<v Speaker 3>That's what you did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's what we're going to do today </v>

2908
02:12:39.490 --> 02:12:39.490
<v Speaker 3>too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you have the time to.</v>

2909
02:12:39.490 --> 02:12:40.520
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's get that one.</v>

2910
02:12:40.550 --> 02:12:43.370
<v Speaker 3>You can breathe in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just fucking unbelievably cold.</v>

2911
02:12:43.640 --> 02:12:48.640
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the one that she did was she set up </v>

2912
02:12:48.640 --> 02:12:48.640
<v Speaker 3>by herself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which you're never supposed to do.</v>

2913
02:12:48.640 --> 02:12:49.220
<v Speaker 3>You're always supposed to have </v>
<v Speaker 3>supervision.</v>

2914
02:12:49.400 --> 02:12:51.230
<v Speaker 3>So it wasn't whether or not.</v>

2915
02:12:51.230 --> 02:12:53.870
<v Speaker 3>I mean she's the only person I've ever </v>
<v Speaker 3>heard of this died from this.</v>

2916
02:12:54.200 --> 02:12:56.240
<v Speaker 3>And it's a horrible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tragic committing suicide.</v>

2917
02:12:56.241 --> 02:12:56.940
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

2918
02:12:56.960 --> 02:12:59.960
<v Speaker 3>She was just worried there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And sometimes women will,</v>

2919
02:12:59.961 --> 02:13:04.961
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll put their face under it because </v>

2920
02:13:04.961 --> 02:13:07.541
<v Speaker 3>they want the effects of a cryo facial </v>
<v Speaker 3>because cryo facial has been shown to </v>

2921
02:13:07.971 --> 02:13:10.820
<v Speaker 3>improve Collagen and flattens your </v>
<v Speaker 3>therapy,</v>

2922
02:13:10.940 --> 02:13:15.940
<v Speaker 3>actually prevents it star,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it inhibits enzymes that break down and </v>

2923
02:13:15.940 --> 02:13:19.830
<v Speaker 3>called college and aces.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's actually part of the reason </v>

2924
02:13:19.830 --> 02:13:22.091
<v Speaker 3>it helps with arthritis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Arthro college and a's is break down </v>

2925
02:13:22.091 --> 02:13:22.250
<v Speaker 3>collagen and they break down like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2926
02:13:22.251 --> 02:13:24.380
<v Speaker 3>the tendons college and around the </v>
<v Speaker 3>tendons and stuff.</v>

2927
02:13:24.381 --> 02:13:26.300
<v Speaker 3>And it can cause arthritis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>arthritic pain.</v>

2928
02:13:26.630 --> 02:13:31.630
<v Speaker 3>So doing it would make sense why you'd </v>
<v Speaker 3>want to do something because it would </v>

2929
02:13:31.630 --> 02:13:32.100
<v Speaker 3>have an effect on your skin.</v>

2930
02:13:32.160 --> 02:13:37.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Women love it when they get their face </v>

2931
02:13:37.160 --> 02:13:39.541
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apparently they get or vein men to or </v>

2932
02:13:39.541 --> 02:13:39.541
<v Speaker 1>any man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hello,</v>

2933
02:13:39.541 --> 02:13:43.100
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to be vain to college.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the point being that article came </v>

2934
02:13:43.100 --> 02:13:43.100
<v Speaker 1>out and all these people were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh see,</v>

2935
02:13:43.100 --> 02:13:44.760
<v Speaker 1>I told Ya,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cryotherapy was bullshit.</v>

2936
02:13:44.761 --> 02:13:45.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

2937
02:13:45.541 --> 02:13:49.260
<v Speaker 1>what a Piss poor article.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was all talking about soreness.</v>

2938
02:13:49.261 --> 02:13:52.300
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that he said that </v>
<v Speaker 1>really drove me crazy was you,</v>

2939
02:13:52.370 --> 02:13:57.370
<v Speaker 1>you'd get just as much benefit from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>cool down and stretch after a workout.</v>

2940
02:13:57.871 --> 02:14:00.420
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell that to these fucking people that I</v>

2941
02:14:00.421 --> 02:14:04.110
<v Speaker 1>see that go there all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that do it twice a day because they have</v>

2942
02:14:04.111 --> 02:14:08.820
<v Speaker 1>severe arthritis and it's the only thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's given them any form of,</v>

2943
02:14:08.860 --> 02:14:09.990
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of freedom,</v>

2944
02:14:09.991 --> 02:14:14.991
<v Speaker 1>of movement of their hands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I know a bunch of people that go </v>

2945
02:14:14.991 --> 02:14:18.171
<v Speaker 1>there that have had some really </v>
<v Speaker 1>debilitating arthritis and this has </v>

2946
02:14:18.171 --> 02:14:21.321
<v Speaker 1>given them a relief where nothing else </v>
<v Speaker 1>was given it to them other than like </v>

2947
02:14:21.321 --> 02:14:24.410
<v Speaker 1>pretty severe pharmaceutical drugs or </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ibuprofen at high levels or what you </v>

2948
02:14:24.410 --> 02:14:24.410
<v Speaker 1>were talking about.</v>

2949
02:14:24.410 --> 02:14:25.650
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a lady that goes to my </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

2950
02:14:25.651 --> 02:14:29.010
<v Speaker 1>but she was raving about how she can </v>
<v Speaker 1>finally stretch your hands out.</v>

2951
02:14:29.160 --> 02:14:32.250
<v Speaker 1>Like her hands had been like locked in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this position for years.</v>

2952
02:14:32.670 --> 02:14:33.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has.</v>

2953
02:14:33.480 --> 02:14:38.480
<v Speaker 1>I mean the cold itself as a paramedic </v>
<v Speaker 1>stressor that is activating a variety of</v>

2954
02:14:39.660 --> 02:14:42.480
<v Speaker 1>antiinflammatory pathways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>antioxidant pathways.</v>

2955
02:14:42.810 --> 02:14:47.810
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's also last time I think on the </v>

2956
02:14:47.810 --> 02:14:48.120
<v Speaker 1>podcast we talked about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it increases norepinephrine,</v>

2957
02:14:48.500 --> 02:14:49.950
<v Speaker 1>epinephrine itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can,</v>

2958
02:14:50.760 --> 02:14:55.530
<v Speaker 1>so cryotherapy and cold water immersion </v>
<v Speaker 1>are two forms of of cold exposure.</v>

2959
02:14:55.860 --> 02:15:00.860
<v Speaker 1>Cryotherapy just two minutes at like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>minus 180 Fahrenheit can increase </v>

2960
02:15:01.231 --> 02:15:02.430
<v Speaker 1>norepinephrine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Twofold.</v>

2961
02:15:02.770 --> 02:15:06.120
<v Speaker 1>That's twofold over what you were before</v>
<v Speaker 1>you went in and nor epinephrin.</v>

2962
02:15:06.330 --> 02:15:09.420
<v Speaker 1>In addition to the brain benefits we </v>
<v Speaker 1>were talking about how it makes you feel</v>

2963
02:15:09.421 --> 02:15:10.830
<v Speaker 1>good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how it helps with learning.</v>

2964
02:15:11.190 --> 02:15:14.130
<v Speaker 1>It also is a very potent antifa </v>
<v Speaker 1>inflammatory,</v>

2965
02:15:14.340 --> 02:15:17.670
<v Speaker 1>so it inhibits the production of TNF </v>
<v Speaker 1>Alpha,</v>

2966
02:15:18.090 --> 02:15:19.460
<v Speaker 1>which is very.</v>

2967
02:15:19.500 --> 02:15:23.520
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of like in arthritis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tnf Alpha is kinda like going haywire.</v>

2968
02:15:23.521 --> 02:15:28.521
<v Speaker 1>You're making too much tnf Alpha,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what happens is tnf alpha is a </v>

2969
02:15:28.521 --> 02:15:29.670
<v Speaker 1>signaling molecule to or your immune </v>
<v Speaker 1>cells that says,</v>

2970
02:15:29.671 --> 02:15:31.830
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an infection here because that's</v>

2971
02:15:31.831 --> 02:15:36.831
<v Speaker 1>normally what happens when you release </v>
<v Speaker 1>Tnf Alpha is because there's some </v>

2972
02:15:36.831 --> 02:15:39.360
<v Speaker 1>bacteria or some something that you need</v>
<v Speaker 1>to kill and so your immune cells,</v>

2973
02:15:39.361 --> 02:15:41.640
<v Speaker 1>all they see is the signal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't know what's causing it.</v>

2974
02:15:41.670 --> 02:15:46.670
<v Speaker 1>They don't know that it's because your </v>
<v Speaker 1>gut cells and your immune cells in your </v>

2975
02:15:46.670 --> 02:15:48.180
<v Speaker 1>gut are seeing bacteria because of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>poor diet or whatever,</v>

2976
02:15:48.181 --> 02:15:53.181
<v Speaker 1>and so that's getting into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bloodstream and causing chronic </v>

2977
02:15:53.181 --> 02:15:53.181
<v Speaker 1>inflammation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't know that it.</v>

2978
02:15:53.181 --> 02:15:57.380
<v Speaker 1>All it knows is that this means there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>a threat and so they start to increase </v>

2979
02:15:57.380 --> 02:16:00.630
<v Speaker 1>the production of your immune cells make</v>
<v Speaker 1>hypochlorite,</v>

2980
02:16:00.710 --> 02:16:01.860
<v Speaker 1>which is like bleach.</v>

2981
02:16:02.520 --> 02:16:07.520
<v Speaker 1>So you're making bleach in your body to </v>
<v Speaker 1>kill things and that's happening </v>

2982
02:16:07.520 --> 02:16:07.520
<v Speaker 1>chronically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's going to cause some tissue damage</v>

2983
02:16:07.520 --> 02:16:10.170
<v Speaker 1>is going to cause pain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It also,</v>

2984
02:16:10.171 --> 02:16:12.830
<v Speaker 1>they also make hydrogen peroxide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You make that.</v>

2985
02:16:12.930 --> 02:16:17.930
<v Speaker 1>Your immune cells will make that so </v>
<v Speaker 1>cryotherapy inhibits the signaling </v>

2986
02:16:17.930 --> 02:16:20.310
<v Speaker 1>molecule so that your immune cells quiet</v>
<v Speaker 1>down because now they're not seeing that</v>

2987
02:16:20.340 --> 02:16:22.050
<v Speaker 1>signal that says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come on,</v>

2988
02:16:22.051 --> 02:16:22.830
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fire up,</v>

2989
02:16:22.831 --> 02:16:24.120
<v Speaker 1>fire up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not there.</v>

2990
02:16:24.330 --> 02:16:26.700
<v Speaker 1>So that's a good thing to inhibit tnf </v>
<v Speaker 1>alpha.</v>

2991
02:16:27.260 --> 02:16:29.040
<v Speaker 1>And like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the college as well.</v>

2992
02:16:29.430 --> 02:16:31.150
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there are so many.</v>

2993
02:16:31.151 --> 02:16:31.640
<v Speaker 1>I did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2994
02:16:31.680 --> 02:16:34.900
<v Speaker 1>I just spent two weeks just researching </v>
<v Speaker 1>and reading.</v>

2995
02:16:35.440 --> 02:16:37.360
<v Speaker 1>I've been doing some cold exposures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2996
02:16:37.361 --> 02:16:42.361
<v Speaker 1>like cold shower and also jumping in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ocean ice bath and I really liked the </v>

2997
02:16:42.361 --> 02:16:46.700
<v Speaker 1>cryo therapy that I did last time we </v>
<v Speaker 1>were here and uh,</v>

2998
02:16:47.230 --> 02:16:49.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I've been very interested in it,</v>

2999
02:16:49.120 --> 02:16:51.250
<v Speaker 1>like understanding why you feel so good.</v>

3000
02:16:51.250 --> 02:16:56.250
<v Speaker 1>And so I did some reading on it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's so many different positive </v>

3001
02:16:56.250 --> 02:16:58.180
<v Speaker 1>hormetic benefits from doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>cryotherapy.</v>

3002
02:16:58.181 --> 02:16:59.590
<v Speaker 1>So you have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3003
02:16:59.591 --> 02:17:00.150
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3004
02:17:00.230 --> 02:17:04.270
<v Speaker 1>the anti-inflammatory part and this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this also,</v>

3005
02:17:04.271 --> 02:17:07.930
<v Speaker 1>it's been shown that doing like 10 </v>
<v Speaker 1>sessions of cryotherapy in a row,</v>

3006
02:17:08.290 --> 02:17:13.290
<v Speaker 1>it increases the expression of </v>
<v Speaker 1>glutathione reductase by two fold and </v>

3007
02:17:13.631 --> 02:17:17.440
<v Speaker 1>another glue of the fly on related </v>
<v Speaker 1>enzyme glutathione peroxidase by like 68</v>

3008
02:17:17.441 --> 02:17:20.680
<v Speaker 1>percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And these are these enzymes like you can</v>

3009
02:17:20.681 --> 02:17:22.960
<v Speaker 1>be taking all the lyposomal glutathione </v>
<v Speaker 1>you want,</v>

3010
02:17:22.961 --> 02:17:27.961
<v Speaker 1>like it's not going to matter if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have the enzyme's active to use </v>

3011
02:17:27.961 --> 02:17:31.501
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you could take lyposomal glutathione </v>

3012
02:17:31.501 --> 02:17:32.000
<v Speaker 1>and that's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're increasing your,</v>

3013
02:17:32.110 --> 02:17:33.810
<v Speaker 1>you make glutathione inside of </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourselves.</v>

3014
02:17:33.850 --> 02:17:34.690
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3015
02:17:35.170 --> 02:17:40.170
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can't make as much of it as we get </v>

3016
02:17:40.170 --> 02:17:41.911
<v Speaker 1>older,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you take it and you don't have </v>

3017
02:17:41.911 --> 02:17:43.330
<v Speaker 1>the enzymes that use it to actually do </v>
<v Speaker 1>the good stuff active,</v>

3018
02:17:43.331 --> 02:17:44.110
<v Speaker 1>that it doesn't matter.</v>

3019
02:17:44.380 --> 02:17:48.820
<v Speaker 1>So cryotherapy was shown to activate to </v>
<v Speaker 1>different glutathione related enzymes,</v>

3020
02:17:48.821 --> 02:17:53.821
<v Speaker 1>which is pretty awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it would enhance your body's ability </v>

3021
02:17:53.821 --> 02:17:56.761
<v Speaker 1>to absorb glutosiome no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't enhance your body's ability </v>

3022
02:17:56.761 --> 02:18:00.091
<v Speaker 1>to absorb it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It enhances your body's ability to use </v>

3023
02:18:00.091 --> 02:18:00.091
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you fight off bad,</v>

3024
02:18:00.091 --> 02:18:02.650
<v Speaker 1>good violin and then you're using </v>
<v Speaker 1>cryotherapy,</v>

3025
02:18:02.651 --> 02:18:04.300
<v Speaker 1>it would enhance it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3026
02:18:04.390 --> 02:18:07.540
<v Speaker 1>so what I'm saying is that the lyposomal</v>
<v Speaker 1>glutathione that you take,</v>

3027
02:18:07.990 --> 02:18:10.930
<v Speaker 1>all that does is increase glutathione </v>
<v Speaker 1>inside of yourselves.</v>

3028
02:18:11.560 --> 02:18:16.560
<v Speaker 1>Glutathione inside of your cells does </v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing without enzymes that use it to,</v>

3029
02:18:17.330 --> 02:18:22.330
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to basically sequester damaging </v>

3030
02:18:22.330 --> 02:18:25.950
<v Speaker 1>inflammatory things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the cryotherapy increased activates </v>

3031
02:18:25.950 --> 02:18:27.490
<v Speaker 1>the enzymes that use it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like,</v>

3032
02:18:27.610 --> 02:18:32.610
<v Speaker 1>great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have all this gludethyon sitting </v>

3033
02:18:32.610 --> 02:18:33.940
<v Speaker 1>around on myself that I've been taking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I also now have the enzymes that use</v>

3034
02:18:33.941 --> 02:18:36.840
<v Speaker 1>it to do good stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now are being turned on that.</v>

3035
02:18:36.850 --> 02:18:40.480
<v Speaker 1>What was very interesting is that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>took like multiple sessions before,</v>

3036
02:18:40.990 --> 02:18:45.990
<v Speaker 1>before those got like 10 to 2010 and one</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least 10 and you have and then the </v>

3037
02:18:45.990 --> 02:18:49.340
<v Speaker 1>other side he was 20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it was it consecutively at day,</v>

3038
02:18:49.480 --> 02:18:50.710
<v Speaker 1>10 days in a row.</v>

3039
02:18:50.980 --> 02:18:52.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 days in a row.</v>

3040
02:18:53.020 --> 02:18:55.260
<v Speaker 1>But the first day I didn't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that,</v>

3041
02:18:55.261 --> 02:18:58.390
<v Speaker 1>that was also very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's almost like your body is saying,</v>

3042
02:18:58.391 --> 02:19:01.350
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this crazy fuck of some response.</v>

3043
02:19:01.351 --> 02:19:01.990
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3044
02:19:01.991 --> 02:19:04.780
<v Speaker 1>Your body is preparing for war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's stressful,</v>

3045
02:19:04.830 --> 02:19:06.070
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a stressful response.</v>

3046
02:19:06.340 --> 02:19:09.880
<v Speaker 1>The other thing that's really cool that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we didn't talk about last minute podcast</v>

3047
02:19:10.480 --> 02:19:15.480
<v Speaker 1>is the thermogenic effect when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you release nor norepinephrine.</v>

3048
02:19:15.850 --> 02:19:20.850
<v Speaker 1>So that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I keep going back to that because it's </v>

3049
02:19:20.850 --> 02:19:20.850
<v Speaker 1>like you can't refute that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Steve Novella,</v>

3050
02:19:20.850 --> 02:19:22.960
<v Speaker 1>no one know debunker skeptic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3051
02:19:22.961 --> 02:19:24.670
<v Speaker 1>I don't care who you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't.</v>

3052
02:19:24.671 --> 02:19:29.671
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's consistent in every type of cold </v>

3053
02:19:29.671 --> 02:19:29.671
<v Speaker 1>exposure period.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

3054
02:19:29.671 --> 02:19:31.040
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's consensus.</v>

3055
02:19:31.250 --> 02:19:32.360
<v Speaker 1>You release norepinephrine.</v>

3056
02:19:32.410 --> 02:19:37.410
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there always seems to be some sort of a </v>

3057
02:19:37.410 --> 02:19:37.410
<v Speaker 3>rationalization with a lot of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>debunking,</v>

3058
02:19:37.410 --> 02:19:38.320
<v Speaker 3>like whether it's the benefits of </v>
<v Speaker 3>exercise,</v>

3059
02:19:38.321 --> 02:19:42.400
<v Speaker 3>whether it's a benefits of Cryo therapy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's almost like a rationalization for</v>

3060
02:19:42.401 --> 02:19:47.401
<v Speaker 3>not doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like you're looking for an excuse </v>

3061
02:19:47.401 --> 02:19:48.130
<v Speaker 3>to not do it and not really very </v>
<v Speaker 3>objective.</v>

3062
02:19:48.190 --> 02:19:49.150
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was,</v>

3063
02:19:49.151 --> 02:19:52.060
<v Speaker 3>which was disturbing about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like this is like you're poopooing</v>

3064
02:19:53.040 --> 02:19:54.370
<v Speaker 1>people grape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3065
02:19:54.520 --> 02:19:55.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3066
02:19:55.300 --> 02:19:57.670
<v Speaker 1>it was clear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean after especially especially after</v>

3067
02:19:57.820 --> 02:19:59.020
<v Speaker 1>the two weeks of research,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3068
02:19:59.230 --> 02:20:01.210
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a kind of mentality when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're.</v>

3069
02:20:01.720 --> 02:20:04.870
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes people like to think I'm a </v>
<v Speaker 1>debunker and I'm not,</v>

3070
02:20:05.440 --> 02:20:06.790
<v Speaker 1>I am,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am intentionally.</v>

3071
02:20:06.791 --> 02:20:11.791
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because if you get in this mentality of </v>

3072
02:20:11.791 --> 02:20:12.800
<v Speaker 1>always debunking something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

3073
02:20:12.820 --> 02:20:15.370
<v Speaker 1>it's like the spiral and you can't see </v>
<v Speaker 1>the good.</v>

3074
02:20:15.371 --> 02:20:18.310
<v Speaker 1>Like you can't keep an open mind to like</v>
<v Speaker 1>get past.</v>

3075
02:20:18.311 --> 02:20:20.650
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's in your box that you know,</v>

3076
02:20:20.651 --> 02:20:22.600
<v Speaker 1>and that's very dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that,</v>

3077
02:20:22.670 --> 02:20:24.780
<v Speaker 1>and I think a lot of blind spots it is </v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

3078
02:20:24.800 --> 02:20:27.700
<v Speaker 1>and there are a lot of scientists that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>know they're very smart,</v>

3079
02:20:27.730 --> 02:20:32.730
<v Speaker 1>extremely smart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they are in that loop where it's </v>

3080
02:20:32.730 --> 02:20:34.440
<v Speaker 1>like just they have to debunk and </v>
<v Speaker 1>criticized and it's like,</v>

3081
02:20:34.441 --> 02:20:39.441
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at some point huge discoveries are made </v>

3082
02:20:39.441 --> 02:20:40.510
<v Speaker 1>by like connecting the dots and getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>past that.</v>

3083
02:20:40.511 --> 02:20:42.610
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you have to be critical.</v>

3084
02:20:42.640 --> 02:20:45.300
<v Speaker 1>Being critical is very important,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you also like,</v>

3085
02:20:45.310 --> 02:20:47.560
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a certain threshold </v>
<v Speaker 1>where you just start to like,</v>

3086
02:20:48.070 --> 02:20:49.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get to the spiral.</v>

3087
02:20:50.210 --> 02:20:53.490
<v Speaker 3>Well it was also was infuriating about </v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the data's out there.</v>

3088
02:20:53.520 --> 02:20:55.590
<v Speaker 3>This is not like it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no data.</v>

3089
02:20:55.591 --> 02:21:00.591
<v Speaker 3>It's like he made a cursory examination </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the evidence and what he chose to </v>

3090
02:21:01.230 --> 02:21:06.230
<v Speaker 3>focus on was it was so subjective.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was focused on a study that tested </v>

3091
02:21:07.020 --> 02:21:08.290
<v Speaker 3>muscle soreness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>posts,</v>

3092
02:21:08.291 --> 02:21:09.350
<v Speaker 3>exercise with cryotherapy.</v>

3093
02:21:09.680 --> 02:21:14.680
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually the study that he referred to </v>

3094
02:21:14.680 --> 02:21:14.680
<v Speaker 1>as a Meta analysis and it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>subjective,</v>

3095
02:21:14.680 --> 02:21:17.240
<v Speaker 1>but it actually came to the conclusion </v>
<v Speaker 1>that there were benefits.</v>

3096
02:21:17.630 --> 02:21:22.630
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it said more studies and that needed to </v>

3097
02:21:22.630 --> 02:21:25.481
<v Speaker 1>be done because there wasn't large </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough sample sizes and the quality of </v>

3098
02:21:25.481 --> 02:21:29.351
<v Speaker 1>data was poor because there were not </v>
<v Speaker 1>double blinded placebo controlled </v>

3099
02:21:29.351 --> 02:21:30.250
<v Speaker 1>clinical trials and I have to say to you</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that,</v>

3100
02:21:30.280 --> 02:21:33.080
<v Speaker 1>so they're actually what he resided in </v>
<v Speaker 1>that article.</v>

3101
02:21:33.110 --> 02:21:36.870
<v Speaker 1>There was a positive effect of the cow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the problem is,</v>

3102
02:21:36.871 --> 02:21:39.740
<v Speaker 1>is that because they followed that up </v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

3103
02:21:39.780 --> 02:21:40.100
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3104
02:21:40.101 --> 02:21:42.370
<v Speaker 1>it's poor quality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically poor science.</v>

3105
02:21:42.680 --> 02:21:47.680
<v Speaker 1>The reality is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that you can't do a double blinded </v>

3106
02:21:47.680 --> 02:21:48.410
<v Speaker 1>placebo control controlled trial with </v>
<v Speaker 1>cryotherapy.</v>

3107
02:21:48.800 --> 02:21:50.510
<v Speaker 1>Like you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be cold and you're going</v>

3108
02:21:50.511 --> 02:21:53.450
<v Speaker 1>to be putting this chamber where there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>like cold or you're not,</v>

3109
02:21:53.451 --> 02:21:56.080
<v Speaker 1>and you're going to know if you're cool,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

3110
02:21:56.180 --> 02:21:57.860
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought that was ridiculous.</v>

3111
02:21:57.861 --> 02:21:58.820
<v Speaker 1>I just like whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in Oregon.</v>

3112
02:21:59.040 --> 02:22:03.530
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to read about this stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I know I've experienced that.</v>

3113
02:22:03.531 --> 02:22:06.050
<v Speaker 1>There's definitely something going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3114
02:22:06.740 --> 02:22:09.350
<v Speaker 1>and one of the things that happens is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the norepinephrine.</v>

3115
02:22:09.351 --> 02:22:11.960
<v Speaker 1>And when he released,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you released that norepinephrine,</v>

3116
02:22:12.380 --> 02:22:17.380
<v Speaker 1>it activates a pathway in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>inside of your cells that basically are </v>

3117
02:22:18.790 --> 02:22:23.790
<v Speaker 1>causes your energy metabolism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>metabolism to ramp up because you're </v>

3118
02:22:23.790 --> 02:22:25.580
<v Speaker 1>trying to generate heat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want basically your wants to.</v>

3119
02:22:25.650 --> 02:22:27.450
<v Speaker 1>Your body is saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to die,</v>

3120
02:22:27.840 --> 02:22:30.570
<v Speaker 1>I need to make heat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so a couple of ways it can do that.</v>

3121
02:22:30.571 --> 02:22:33.570
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can shiver and shivering is when your</v>

3122
02:22:33.571 --> 02:22:37.970
<v Speaker 1>muscles start to contract and that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>requires energy for your muscles to like</v>

3123
02:22:38.010 --> 02:22:39.330
<v Speaker 1>twitch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very,</v>

3124
02:22:39.350 --> 02:22:44.350
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not very thermodynamically </v>

3125
02:22:44.350 --> 02:22:44.350
<v Speaker 1>favorable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you,</v>

3126
02:22:44.350 --> 02:22:47.900
<v Speaker 1>it's not a good way to generate heat but</v>
<v Speaker 1>you generate heat because you have to </v>

3127
02:22:47.900 --> 02:22:47.910
<v Speaker 1>like ramp up to twitch.</v>

3128
02:22:48.390 --> 02:22:50.130
<v Speaker 1>But then what happens after you've been </v>
<v Speaker 1>exposed?</v>

3129
02:22:50.131 --> 02:22:52.320
<v Speaker 1>And actually this happens to me because </v>
<v Speaker 1>we did the crowd twice.</v>

3130
02:22:52.321 --> 02:22:57.321
<v Speaker 1>The first time I did it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was shivering like the entire time I </v>

3131
02:22:57.321 --> 02:22:58.980
<v Speaker 1>was shivering it was really crazy </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I've never shivered like that in</v>

3132
02:22:58.981 --> 02:23:03.981
<v Speaker 1>my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the second time I went in I did not </v>

3133
02:23:03.981 --> 02:23:03.981
<v Speaker 1>shiver.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And after reading about it,</v>

3134
02:23:03.981 --> 02:23:06.210
<v Speaker 1>what happens is your body quickly adapt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you adapt.</v>

3135
02:23:06.211 --> 02:23:08.790
<v Speaker 1>And what happens is non shivering </v>
<v Speaker 1>thermogenesis,</v>

3136
02:23:09.120 --> 02:23:12.660
<v Speaker 1>so the nor epinephrin causes your </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mitochondria,</v>

3137
02:23:12.661 --> 02:23:15.950
<v Speaker 1>which are the energy producing little </v>
<v Speaker 1>organelles inside of yourselves,</v>

3138
02:23:15.951 --> 02:23:17.190
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it causes them in your,</v>

3139
02:23:17.400 --> 02:23:22.400
<v Speaker 1>in your adipose tissue to get activated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it does this by increasing the </v>

3140
02:23:22.400 --> 02:23:27.231
<v Speaker 1>expression of a gene called UCP,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one which basically freaks your </v>

3141
02:23:27.231 --> 02:23:29.550
<v Speaker 1>mitochondria out because your </v>
<v Speaker 1>mitochondria are kind of like batteries.</v>

3142
02:23:29.700 --> 02:23:34.700
<v Speaker 1>They're charged,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have a negative charge on the </v>

3143
02:23:34.700 --> 02:23:34.700
<v Speaker 1>inside and a positive charge on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>outside.</v>

3144
02:23:34.700 --> 02:23:38.070
<v Speaker 1>Will ucp one totally uncouples that so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's no more charge.</v>

3145
02:23:38.430 --> 02:23:41.320
<v Speaker 1>And that charge is very important </v>
<v Speaker 1>because when that charges is there,</v>

3146
02:23:41.550 --> 02:23:42.750
<v Speaker 1>your body knows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

3147
02:23:42.751 --> 02:23:46.230
<v Speaker 1>I've been making energy because the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>you make the charge is by making energy.</v>

3148
02:23:46.530 --> 02:23:48.090
<v Speaker 1>So when the charge goes away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your body's like,</v>

3149
02:23:48.120 --> 02:23:49.860
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got no energy.</v>

3150
02:23:49.861 --> 02:23:52.380
<v Speaker 1>So it just starts to ramp up fat </v>
<v Speaker 1>metabolism.</v>

3151
02:23:52.710 --> 02:23:55.350
<v Speaker 1>So it does that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you start to make more mitochondria.</v>

3152
02:23:55.351 --> 02:24:00.351
<v Speaker 1>So you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're making more mitochondria in your </v>

3153
02:24:00.351 --> 02:24:00.351
<v Speaker 1>fat cells.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is often called Brown fat,</v>

3154
02:24:00.351 --> 02:24:05.140
<v Speaker 1>so you can actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reason it's called Brown fat is </v>

3155
02:24:05.140 --> 02:24:05.140
<v Speaker 1>because when you look at a fat cell </v>
<v Speaker 1>under the microscope,</v>

3156
02:24:05.140 --> 02:24:07.560
<v Speaker 1>if it has more mitochondria than it </v>
<v Speaker 1>looks Brown,</v>

3157
02:24:07.920 --> 02:24:11.850
<v Speaker 1>so you actually start to burn fat and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have this thermogenic because you're</v>

3158
02:24:11.851 --> 02:24:16.851
<v Speaker 1>burning fat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's creating heat as a byproduct so </v>

3159
02:24:16.851 --> 02:24:19.341
<v Speaker 1>you're warming your body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it has this nice side effect of </v>

3160
02:24:19.341 --> 02:24:19.341
<v Speaker 1>burning fat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which people like.</v>

3161
02:24:19.341 --> 02:24:20.910
<v Speaker 1>And the more you expose yourself to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>cold,</v>

3162
02:24:21.150 --> 02:24:26.150
<v Speaker 1>the more you're browning your fat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more you're increasing those </v>

3163
02:24:26.150 --> 02:24:26.150
<v Speaker 1>mitochondria,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your fats,</v>

3164
02:24:26.150 --> 02:24:26.670
<v Speaker 1>which means the next time you're in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>cold,</v>

3165
02:24:26.820 --> 02:24:31.820
<v Speaker 1>you can tolerate it longer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So people that have been exposing </v>

3166
02:24:31.820 --> 02:24:32.430
<v Speaker 1>themselves to cold like yourself when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing the Cryo,</v>

3167
02:24:32.490 --> 02:24:37.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>often you actually can tolerate the </v>

3168
02:24:37.490 --> 02:24:40.380
<v Speaker 1>colder for longer periods of time </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you have more mitochondria in </v>

3169
02:24:40.380 --> 02:24:44.781
<v Speaker 1>your fat cells.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this allows you to then generate </v>

3170
02:24:44.781 --> 02:24:44.781
<v Speaker 1>more heat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

3171
02:24:44.781 --> 02:24:48.190
<v Speaker 1>and this has been shown in people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that have been exposed to a cold,</v>

3172
02:24:48.191 --> 02:24:50.080
<v Speaker 1>that they have been shown to increase </v>
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>

3173
02:24:50.330 --> 02:24:50.880
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3174
02:24:50.940 --> 02:24:55.940
<v Speaker 1>Brown adipose tissue by like 38 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they're exposed to 10 days of 50 </v>

3175
02:24:55.940 --> 02:24:56.930
<v Speaker 1>degree air,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like outside air.</v>

3176
02:24:56.940 --> 02:24:58.820
<v Speaker 1>Just regular air,</v>
<v Speaker 1>50 degrees all,</v>

3177
02:24:59.130 --> 02:25:00.030
<v Speaker 1>all day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 days,</v>

3178
02:25:00.700 --> 02:25:03.060
<v Speaker 1>so like six hours a day out in like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3179
02:25:03.180 --> 02:25:04.840
<v Speaker 1>New York in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

3180
02:25:05.310 --> 02:25:07.050
<v Speaker 1>pretty winter or fall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

3181
02:25:07.080 --> 02:25:10.350
<v Speaker 1>something like that being out there for </v>
<v Speaker 1>six hours for 10 days in a row.</v>

3182
02:25:10.530 --> 02:25:15.530
<v Speaker 1>Men were able to increase their brown </v>
<v Speaker 1>adipose tissue by like 38 percent or </v>

3183
02:25:15.530 --> 02:25:18.351
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So people from the east coast or from </v>

3184
02:25:18.351 --> 02:25:20.811
<v Speaker 1>the northeast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the move to California and then they go </v>

3185
02:25:20.811 --> 02:25:20.811
<v Speaker 1>back during the winter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they go home,</v>

3186
02:25:20.811 --> 02:25:24.681
<v Speaker 1>my blood got too thin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was really is there really is like a </v>

3187
02:25:24.681 --> 02:25:26.200
<v Speaker 1>physical factor of your body not being </v>
<v Speaker 1>accustomed to dealing with colby.</v>

3188
02:25:26.350 --> 02:25:27.340
<v Speaker 1>You adapt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you adapt.</v>

3189
02:25:27.341 --> 02:25:29.890
<v Speaker 1>And that's what Brown adipose tissue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's really one cold.</v>

3190
02:25:30.010 --> 02:25:33.340
<v Speaker 1>How cold got really popular.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Popularized because people wanted to use</v>

3191
02:25:33.341 --> 02:25:35.210
<v Speaker 1>it as a hack to lose weight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

3192
02:25:35.230 --> 02:25:36.100
<v Speaker 1>So they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3193
02:25:36.101 --> 02:25:41.101
<v Speaker 1>if I do these cold showers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I use it for the brain benefits because </v>

3194
02:25:41.101 --> 02:25:44.110
<v Speaker 1>I noticed I feel really good and also </v>
<v Speaker 1>more focused.</v>

3195
02:25:44.200 --> 02:25:49.200
<v Speaker 1>So I like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of people I've talked to have </v>

3196
02:25:49.200 --> 02:25:49.200
<v Speaker 1>felt the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3197
02:25:49.480 --> 02:25:52.970
<v Speaker 1>but then I think the other part of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>article was the,</v>

3198
02:25:52.990 --> 02:25:57.660
<v Speaker 1>the effects of it blunting some of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>strength training and you know,</v>

3199
02:25:57.810 --> 02:26:02.810
<v Speaker 1>I talk about this in this report that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrote or the in the podcasts that I </v>

3200
02:26:02.810 --> 02:26:04.960
<v Speaker 1>released on and it's so complicated I </v>
<v Speaker 1>had to like sit there and literally just</v>

3201
02:26:04.961 --> 02:26:08.590
<v Speaker 1>read for like two weeks to try to figure</v>
<v Speaker 1>it out because you know,</v>

3202
02:26:08.591 --> 02:26:11.440
<v Speaker 1>the problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that exercise is a hormetic stress.</v>

3203
02:26:11.680 --> 02:26:14.530
<v Speaker 1>Cold is a hormetic stress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So exercise itself,</v>

3204
02:26:14.590 --> 02:26:19.590
<v Speaker 1>you need some of the inflammation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need the bad stuff to get the good </v>

3205
02:26:19.590 --> 02:26:19.660
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how it works.</v>

3206
02:26:20.160 --> 02:26:25.160
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the inflammation that's happening </v>

3207
02:26:25.160 --> 02:26:25.780
<v Speaker 1>happens while you're exercising and up </v>
<v Speaker 1>to one hour after,</v>

3208
02:26:26.110 --> 02:26:31.110
<v Speaker 1>one hour after.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's when the whole hormetic response </v>

3209
02:26:31.110 --> 02:26:34.321
<v Speaker 1>kicks in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this has been shown in multiple </v>

3210
02:26:34.321 --> 02:26:35.791
<v Speaker 1>studies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One hour seems to be when the anti </v>

3211
02:26:35.791 --> 02:26:39.081
<v Speaker 1>inflammatory response kicks in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you've generated the implementation </v>

3212
02:26:39.081 --> 02:26:39.430
<v Speaker 1>and then now you've got the </v>
<v Speaker 1>antiinflammatory effects.</v>

3213
02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:44.680
<v Speaker 1>If you do a cold exposure within that </v>
<v Speaker 1>hour after exercising,</v>

3214
02:26:45.370 --> 02:26:50.370
<v Speaker 1>it's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You may blunt some of the inflammatory </v>

3215
02:26:50.370 --> 02:26:53.431
<v Speaker 1>effects that the exercise is inducing </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the cold is activating anti </v>

3216
02:26:53.431 --> 02:26:54.970
<v Speaker 1>inflammatory genes too early.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

3217
02:26:55.120 --> 02:26:57.430
<v Speaker 1>I don't know that for certain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I do know that this,</v>

3218
02:26:57.460 --> 02:27:00.760
<v Speaker 1>this study that showed there was one </v>
<v Speaker 1>study that showed strength training.</v>

3219
02:27:00.970 --> 02:27:01.740
<v Speaker 1>If you did it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were,</v>

3220
02:27:01.750 --> 02:27:05.750
<v Speaker 1>if you did cryotherapy immediately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like mediafly after a Cold War,</v>

3221
02:27:05.770 --> 02:27:10.770
<v Speaker 1>it was actually cold water immersion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is not the same as the Cryo cryo </v>

3222
02:27:10.770 --> 02:27:13.510
<v Speaker 1>chamber that it blended some of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>anabolic signaling.</v>

3223
02:27:13.540 --> 02:27:15.910
<v Speaker 1>And so there was like some of the muscle</v>
<v Speaker 1>mass was,</v>

3224
02:27:15.990 --> 02:27:18.400
<v Speaker 1>was not gained,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

3225
02:27:18.401 --> 02:27:21.880
<v Speaker 1>there's other studies that have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>done that have shown for some reason.</v>

3226
02:27:21.881 --> 02:27:23.920
<v Speaker 1>All the endurance guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they always wait an hour.</v>

3227
02:27:24.520 --> 02:27:29.520
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what I'm wondering is if people that </v>

3228
02:27:29.520 --> 02:27:31.810
<v Speaker 1>are doing this research like sit down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take a step back,</v>

3229
02:27:32.560 --> 02:27:33.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are always in this.</v>

3230
02:27:33.551 --> 02:27:34.810
<v Speaker 1>I got to Polish it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How to publish,</v>

3231
02:27:34.811 --> 02:27:39.811
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a real big publisher parish </v>

3232
02:27:39.811 --> 02:27:41.821
<v Speaker 1>mentality and science where it's like </v>
<v Speaker 1>your bread and butter depends on your </v>

3233
02:27:41.821 --> 02:27:43.900
<v Speaker 1>publishing and so you're just constantly</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to get that data out there,</v>

3234
02:27:44.560 --> 02:27:49.560
<v Speaker 1>but you really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think things are so complicated just </v>

3235
02:27:49.560 --> 02:27:50.320
<v Speaker 1>to sit down and take a look at </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything that's out there and start to</v>

3236
02:27:50.321 --> 02:27:53.080
<v Speaker 1>go wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's lots of little details that need</v>

3237
02:27:53.081 --> 02:27:55.660
<v Speaker 1>to be considered to design this trial </v>
<v Speaker 1>correctly.</v>

3238
02:27:55.990 --> 02:28:00.990
<v Speaker 1>So I'm hoping that at least for those </v>
<v Speaker 1>people doing strength training that </v>

3239
02:28:00.990 --> 02:28:02.830
<v Speaker 1>they'll do one where they actually wait </v>
<v Speaker 1>until an hour because there's been other</v>

3240
02:28:02.831 --> 02:28:07.831
<v Speaker 1>studies where that strength to strength </v>
<v Speaker 1>training in combination with cryotherapy</v>

3241
02:28:08.111 --> 02:28:13.111
<v Speaker 1>done much later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even the next day there were actually </v>

3242
02:28:13.111 --> 02:28:13.111
<v Speaker 1>benefits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>performance benefits.</v>

3243
02:28:13.111 --> 02:28:15.100
<v Speaker 1>Like they able to do more of those leg </v>
<v Speaker 1>curl things.</v>

3244
02:28:15.101 --> 02:28:17.860
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what they called leg </v>
<v Speaker 1>extensions.</v>

3245
02:28:17.861 --> 02:28:18.840
<v Speaker 1>Those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

3246
02:28:18.850 --> 02:28:20.200
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3247
02:28:20.260 --> 02:28:25.260
<v Speaker 1>I don't really know what's going on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what I do know is that it seems as </v>

3248
02:28:25.260 --> 02:28:26.420
<v Speaker 1>though it's very likely that during the </v>
<v Speaker 1>crowd therapy,</v>

3249
02:28:26.421 --> 02:28:29.210
<v Speaker 1>like immediately after and now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then again,</v>

3250
02:28:29.211 --> 02:28:34.211
<v Speaker 1>if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're talking about someone that's </v>

3251
02:28:34.211 --> 02:28:34.211
<v Speaker 1>doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3252
02:28:34.211 --> 02:28:36.550
<v Speaker 1>like there's been studies that have been</v>
<v Speaker 1>published showing that people that are </v>

3253
02:28:36.550 --> 02:28:39.791
<v Speaker 1>doing two bouts of exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they're like riding a bike and then </v>

3254
02:28:39.791 --> 02:28:40.700
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're waiting whatever,</v>

3255
02:28:40.701 --> 02:28:43.850
<v Speaker 1>30 minutes and then they go and run or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

3256
02:28:44.390 --> 02:28:46.520
<v Speaker 1>If they do cold water immersion in </v>
<v Speaker 1>between those,</v>

3257
02:28:46.850 --> 02:28:48.620
<v Speaker 1>they actually have performance </v>
<v Speaker 1>enhancements.</v>

3258
02:28:49.670 --> 02:28:50.290
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they,</v>

3259
02:28:50.360 --> 02:28:52.130
<v Speaker 1>if they wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry,</v>

3260
02:28:52.131 --> 02:28:53.960
<v Speaker 1>I have to do it between two bouts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>exercise.</v>

3261
02:28:54.230 --> 02:28:55.850
<v Speaker 1>Some of that's due to the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 1>cold,</v>

3262
02:28:56.120 --> 02:29:01.120
<v Speaker 1>the cold water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems to improve heart rate </v>

3263
02:29:01.120 --> 02:29:03.761
<v Speaker 1>variability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It x has been shown to improve it by </v>

3264
02:29:03.761 --> 02:29:06.101
<v Speaker 1>like two to three fold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So heart rate variability is the change </v>

3265
02:29:06.101 --> 02:29:08.720
<v Speaker 1>in oscillation between heartbeats and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's also,</v>

3266
02:29:08.721 --> 02:29:09.890
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

3267
02:29:10.490 --> 02:29:12.920
<v Speaker 1>people judge a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the heart recovery from a workout.</v>

3268
02:29:12.921 --> 02:29:14.930
<v Speaker 1>So as soon as you're done with an </v>
<v Speaker 1>intense workout,</v>

3269
02:29:15.200 --> 02:29:17.870
<v Speaker 1>the ability of your heart rate to lower </v>
<v Speaker 1>immediately within minutes,</v>

3270
02:29:17.871 --> 02:29:19.820
<v Speaker 1>that's like a marker of heart rate </v>
<v Speaker 1>variability.</v>

3271
02:29:19.821 --> 02:29:24.821
<v Speaker 1>And it's supposed to be good because </v>
<v Speaker 1>your parts able to deal with these </v>

3272
02:29:24.821 --> 02:29:24.821
<v Speaker 1>stressful changes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3273
02:29:24.821 --> 02:29:26.570
<v Speaker 1>because when you're making cortisol or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

3274
02:29:26.571 --> 02:29:30.320
<v Speaker 1>your heart starts racing more or some of</v>
<v Speaker 1>these other stress hormones,</v>

3275
02:29:30.770 --> 02:29:35.770
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's been shown to improve that and </v>

3276
02:29:35.770 --> 02:29:37.410
<v Speaker 1>having her being able to have your heart</v>
<v Speaker 1>rate slower right after a workout and </v>

3277
02:29:37.410 --> 02:29:38.120
<v Speaker 1>then you're immediately going to do a </v>
<v Speaker 1>workout again.</v>

3278
02:29:38.120 --> 02:29:40.370
<v Speaker 1>You can imagine there would be an </v>
<v Speaker 1>performance enhancement with,</v>

3279
02:29:40.520 --> 02:29:43.010
<v Speaker 1>with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's also,</v>

3280
02:29:43.011 --> 02:29:48.011
<v Speaker 1>there's a difference in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>physiological response between cold </v>

3281
02:29:48.011 --> 02:29:48.830
<v Speaker 1>water immersion and Cryo therapy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3282
02:29:49.190 --> 02:29:50.000
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it depends,</v>

3283
02:29:50.060 --> 02:29:51.320
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3284
02:29:51.360 --> 02:29:54.470
<v Speaker 1>if there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are differences in the ability for</v>

3285
02:29:54.471 --> 02:29:57.590
<v Speaker 1>those two different modalities to </v>
<v Speaker 1>extract heat from the body,</v>

3286
02:29:58.030 --> 02:30:03.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we're talking about submerging </v>

3287
02:30:03.030 --> 02:30:03.030
<v Speaker 1>ourselves and cold water up to our </v>
<v Speaker 1>shoulders,</v>

3288
02:30:03.510 --> 02:30:07.760
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>water or ice is a much better.</v>

3289
02:30:08.400 --> 02:30:10.760
<v Speaker 1>It's much better at extracting heat from</v>
<v Speaker 1>the body,</v>

3290
02:30:10.761 --> 02:30:12.250
<v Speaker 1>then error.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3291
02:30:12.530 --> 02:30:15.830
<v Speaker 1>but surface area also plays a role and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the temperature change.</v>

3292
02:30:15.831 --> 02:30:19.340
<v Speaker 1>So if you're sitting in cold water </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's 57 degrees,</v>

3293
02:30:20.300 --> 02:30:24.290
<v Speaker 1>that's not as cold as going into a minus</v>
<v Speaker 1>180 or whatever crowd chamber.</v>

3294
02:30:24.740 --> 02:30:27.560
<v Speaker 1>But you can also sit in the cold water </v>
<v Speaker 1>for a lot longer,</v>

3295
02:30:27.990 --> 02:30:32.360
<v Speaker 1>so I do it for 15 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that there has been a study that</v>

3296
02:30:32.361 --> 02:30:37.361
<v Speaker 1>compared the norepinephrine release,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 seconds at 40 degree water up to the </v>

3297
02:30:37.361 --> 02:30:42.161
<v Speaker 1>shoulders is comparable to two minutes </v>
<v Speaker 1>at a minus standard,</v>

3298
02:30:42.951 --> 02:30:46.490
<v Speaker 1>something one 80 minus one 84,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no norepinephrine,</v>

3299
02:30:46.491 --> 02:30:49.490
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of the effects are mediated </v>
<v Speaker 1>from nor norepinephrine,</v>

3300
02:30:49.550 --> 02:30:52.160
<v Speaker 1>but listened to 20 seconds at 40 to </v>
<v Speaker 1>reverse those two minutes.</v>

3301
02:30:52.160 --> 02:30:57.160
<v Speaker 1>So imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine staying in the water for five </v>

3302
02:30:57.160 --> 02:30:57.440
<v Speaker 1>minutes in that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this has been shown.</v>

3303
02:30:57.441 --> 02:31:01.280
<v Speaker 1>So if you have someone that stays in </v>
<v Speaker 1>water 57 degree water for an hour,</v>

3304
02:31:01.580 --> 02:31:04.640
<v Speaker 1>they increased their norepinephrine by </v>
<v Speaker 1>fivefold instead of twofold.</v>

3305
02:31:04.790 --> 02:31:08.030
<v Speaker 1>So you have a more robust response.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it could be good,</v>

3306
02:31:08.750 --> 02:31:13.750
<v Speaker 1>but it could be bad if you're talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about doing it right after a strength </v>

3307
02:31:13.750 --> 02:31:14.840
<v Speaker 1>training session and jump into cold </v>
<v Speaker 1>water for five minutes.</v>

3308
02:31:15.140 --> 02:31:20.140
<v Speaker 1>That could.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That could have some very potent </v>

3309
02:31:20.140 --> 02:31:22.170
<v Speaker 1>antiinflammatory effects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the best way to handle it would be to</v>

3310
02:31:22.171 --> 02:31:24.420
<v Speaker 1>wait at least an hour,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

3311
02:31:24.590 --> 02:31:26.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that makes sense.</v>

3312
02:31:26.670 --> 02:31:29.250
<v Speaker 1>What about a anti inflammatory markers </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the blood?</v>

3313
02:31:30.510 --> 02:31:35.510
<v Speaker 1>So there have been studies that have </v>
<v Speaker 1>shown that cryotherapy lower c reactive </v>

3314
02:31:35.510 --> 02:31:36.840
<v Speaker 1>protein,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which would be an inflammatory marker,</v>

3315
02:31:36.841 --> 02:31:41.010
<v Speaker 1>and then the glutathione related enzymes</v>
<v Speaker 1>going up and also superoxide dismutase,</v>

3316
02:31:41.011 --> 02:31:46.011
<v Speaker 1>that would be a marker for inflammation </v>
<v Speaker 1>because there's also a decrease </v>

3317
02:31:46.111 --> 02:31:47.730
<v Speaker 1>inflammation when you have more of </v>
<v Speaker 1>those.</v>

3318
02:31:48.240 --> 02:31:49.980
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so cryotherapy does.</v>

3319
02:31:49.981 --> 02:31:50.980
<v Speaker 1>And then also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3320
02:31:51.270 --> 02:31:54.150
<v Speaker 1>there's been mark measurements of TNF </v>
<v Speaker 1>Alpha going down.</v>

3321
02:31:54.151 --> 02:31:58.170
<v Speaker 1>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm also another marker that macrophages</v>

3322
02:31:58.171 --> 02:32:00.900
<v Speaker 1>release macrophage inhibitory protein or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

3323
02:32:00.960 --> 02:32:02.930
<v Speaker 1>some inflammatory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3324
02:32:03.260 --> 02:32:06.000
<v Speaker 1>a molecule that's made,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's less of it when you,</v>

3325
02:32:06.030 --> 02:32:11.030
<v Speaker 1>when Cold War,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember if as cold water </v>

3326
02:32:11.030 --> 02:32:11.030
<v Speaker 1>immersion or cryotherapy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's cold exposure.</v>

3327
02:32:11.030 --> 02:32:15.710
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was mediated through norb and </v>

3328
02:32:15.710 --> 02:32:15.710
<v Speaker 1>ignore epinephrin mediates a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

3329
02:32:15.710 --> 02:32:16.580
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's mediating the brain effects.</v>

3330
02:32:16.581 --> 02:32:18.980
<v Speaker 1>It's mediating the thermogenesis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's antiinflammatory,</v>

3331
02:32:18.981 --> 02:32:23.981
<v Speaker 1>it's anti pain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People get injected with norepinephrine </v>

3332
02:32:23.981 --> 02:32:24.690
<v Speaker 1>and their spine to alleviate a pain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

3333
02:32:24.691 --> 02:32:26.670
<v Speaker 1>because it's anti inflammatory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

3334
02:32:27.000 --> 02:32:32.000
<v Speaker 1>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's probably other things going on </v>

3335
02:32:32.000 --> 02:32:32.310
<v Speaker 1>as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So science just science,</v>

3336
02:32:32.311 --> 02:32:37.311
<v Speaker 1>just the hard science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's plenty of evidence that there's </v>

3337
02:32:37.311 --> 02:32:37.311
<v Speaker 1>benefits to grow therapy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

3338
02:32:37.311 --> 02:32:38.940
<v Speaker 1>so why would I write an article like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>

3339
02:32:40.260 --> 02:32:42.120
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said there's the,</v>

3340
02:32:42.150 --> 02:32:46.770
<v Speaker 1>there's the bad article that was the </v>
<v Speaker 1>anabolic blunting effects which was done</v>

3341
02:32:47.310 --> 02:32:52.310
<v Speaker 1>immediately after exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which made a huge splash because it's </v>

3342
02:32:52.310 --> 02:32:52.310
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

3343
02:32:52.310 --> 02:32:52.980
<v Speaker 1>you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your gains.</v>

3344
02:32:53.260 --> 02:32:55.630
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you have the,</v>

3345
02:32:55.820 --> 02:33:00.820
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hardcore are very skeptical people </v>

3346
02:33:00.820 --> 02:33:00.820
<v Speaker 1>that are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3347
02:33:00.820 --> 02:33:00.870
<v Speaker 1>the quality of data,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

3348
02:33:00.871 --> 02:33:01.680
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing is,</v>

3349
02:33:01.681 --> 02:33:06.681
<v Speaker 1>is that there's a large body of data and</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes if you can't have a double </v>

3350
02:33:06.681 --> 02:33:09.390
<v Speaker 1>blinded placebo controlled trial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you have to look at mechanism.</v>

3351
02:33:09.630 --> 02:33:12.060
<v Speaker 1>You have to look at animal studies </v>
<v Speaker 1>combined with human studies.</v>

3352
02:33:12.210 --> 02:33:16.110
<v Speaker 1>You have to understand what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't refute the norepinephrine.</v>

3353
02:33:16.150 --> 02:33:18.030
<v Speaker 1>We know that norepinephrine is doing all</v>
<v Speaker 1>these things,</v>

3354
02:33:18.300 --> 02:33:23.300
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think you just have to be very </v>

3355
02:33:23.300 --> 02:33:23.910
<v Speaker 1>comprehensive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially when the,</v>

3356
02:33:23.970 --> 02:33:26.340
<v Speaker 1>when you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's the argument that the,</v>

3357
02:33:26.341 --> 02:33:29.160
<v Speaker 1>there's no placebo controlled trials or </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3358
02:33:29.161 --> 02:33:34.161
<v Speaker 1>it's too subjective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's lots of ways that it's not </v>

3359
02:33:34.161 --> 02:33:34.161
<v Speaker 1>subjective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this has been measured in people.</v>

3360
02:33:34.161 --> 02:33:38.841
<v Speaker 1>People have measured the direct approach</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they've measured these enzyme </v>

3361
02:33:38.841 --> 02:33:41.631
<v Speaker 1>activities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've measured these inflammatory </v>

3362
02:33:41.631 --> 02:33:41.631
<v Speaker 1>molecules.</v>

3363
02:33:41.631 --> 02:33:41.631
<v Speaker 1>And people also in animals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3364
02:33:41.631 --> 02:33:42.540
<v Speaker 1>so there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3365
02:33:42.560 --> 02:33:47.560
<v Speaker 1>I'm confident when I say that there are </v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely health benefits from doing </v>

3366
02:33:47.560 --> 02:33:49.920
<v Speaker 1>cold exposure for your brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anti-inflammatory,</v>

3367
02:33:50.100 --> 02:33:52.530
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for thermogenesis,</v>

3368
02:33:52.710 --> 02:33:53.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being able to your,</v>

3369
02:33:54.030 --> 02:33:55.560
<v Speaker 1>if you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is actually a,</v>

3370
02:33:55.650 --> 02:33:57.000
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a target a lot.</v>

3371
02:33:57.001 --> 02:33:59.040
<v Speaker 1>I know a lot of researchers that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>working on this,</v>

3372
02:33:59.041 --> 02:34:04.041
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>find a way to pharmacologically brown </v>

3373
02:34:04.951 --> 02:34:08.400
<v Speaker 1>fat because it increases fat burning and</v>
<v Speaker 1>weight loss.</v>

3374
02:34:08.440 --> 02:34:10.360
<v Speaker 1>So we will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

3375
02:34:10.361 --> 02:34:12.230
<v Speaker 1>it always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people always try to do that with,</v>

3376
02:34:13.200 --> 02:34:14.970
<v Speaker 1>I prefer the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3377
02:34:15.150 --> 02:34:20.150
<v Speaker 1>the cold exposure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But other things do at fish oil was </v>

3378
02:34:20.150 --> 02:34:21.910
<v Speaker 1>shown to recently do that to increase a </v>
<v Speaker 1>brown Brown adipose tissue.</v>

3379
02:34:21.911 --> 02:34:26.530
<v Speaker 1>So a plant based Omega six and three's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3380
02:34:26.610 --> 02:34:27.190
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

3381
02:34:27.191 --> 02:34:28.360
<v Speaker 1>That's um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the,</v>

3382
02:34:28.390 --> 02:34:31.870
<v Speaker 1>so the fish or it was two grams of EPA </v>
<v Speaker 1>and one gram of EPA,</v>

3383
02:34:32.200 --> 02:34:32.830
<v Speaker 1>Dha.</v>

3384
02:34:33.520 --> 02:34:38.520
<v Speaker 1>And it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it increased fat burning by like 27 </v>

3385
02:34:38.520 --> 02:34:42.511
<v Speaker 1>percent or something during exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then at resting and increased it by </v>

3386
02:34:42.511 --> 02:34:44.230
<v Speaker 1>something in the teens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>17 or 13 percent.</v>

3387
02:34:44.650 --> 02:34:47.800
<v Speaker 1>And that was just at rest fat burning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the way it was shown,</v>

3388
02:34:47.801 --> 02:34:49.570
<v Speaker 1>the way it did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was by increasing UCP,</v>

3389
02:34:49.571 --> 02:34:54.571
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uncoupling the Mitochondria and causing </v>

3390
02:34:54.571 --> 02:34:56.450
<v Speaker 1>your basically causing your fat to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>more Mitochondria and Brown fat.</v>

3391
02:34:56.710 --> 02:34:58.900
<v Speaker 1>Super Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been taking high doses official,</v>

3392
02:34:59.050 --> 02:35:04.050
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to answer your question that the plant </v>

3393
02:35:04.050 --> 02:35:04.050
<v Speaker 1>version,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is always a problem with a.</v>

3394
02:35:04.060 --> 02:35:09.060
<v Speaker 1>I get this question a lot from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from people that are Vegan or </v>

3395
02:35:09.060 --> 02:35:09.060
<v Speaker 1>vegetarian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3396
02:35:09.060 --> 02:35:11.230
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I get my Omega three from the plant</v>

3397
02:35:11.231 --> 02:35:12.970
<v Speaker 1>version,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alpha linolenic acid.</v>

3398
02:35:13.420 --> 02:35:15.210
<v Speaker 1>And actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3399
02:35:15.280 --> 02:35:20.280
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of important things to </v>

3400
02:35:20.280 --> 02:35:21.751
<v Speaker 1>consider.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is that Alpha linolenic acid is </v>

3401
02:35:21.751 --> 02:35:22.720
<v Speaker 1>poorly converted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All these are.</v>

3402
02:35:22.720 --> 02:35:27.720
<v Speaker 1>These are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are long chain polyunsaturated </v>

3403
02:35:27.720 --> 02:35:27.730
<v Speaker 1>fatty acids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alpha linolenic acids.</v>

3404
02:35:27.731 --> 02:35:32.731
<v Speaker 1>18 EPA is 20 eicosapentaenoic acid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is found in fish.</v>

3405
02:35:33.130 --> 02:35:35.170
<v Speaker 1>And then Dha is 22.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you basically,</v>

3406
02:35:35.171 --> 02:35:37.750
<v Speaker 1>your body will take the Alpha Linolenic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is implants,</v>

3407
02:35:37.830 --> 02:35:40.900
<v Speaker 1>flax seeds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>walnuts,</v>

3408
02:35:41.380 --> 02:35:44.530
<v Speaker 1>and it will start adding carbons on to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make the other ones because you need the</v>

3409
02:35:44.531 --> 02:35:46.960
<v Speaker 1>other one's 30 percent of your brain is </v>
<v Speaker 1>made of Dha.</v>

3410
02:35:47.260 --> 02:35:49.660
<v Speaker 1>Dha is very important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the thing is,</v>

3411
02:35:49.661 --> 02:35:54.661
<v Speaker 1>is that most men actually only convert </v>
<v Speaker 1>about eight percent of Alpha linolenic </v>

3412
02:35:54.791 --> 02:35:56.710
<v Speaker 1>acid into,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3413
02:35:57.070 --> 02:36:02.070
<v Speaker 1>into EPA and only four percent into Dha,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not very much now estrogen and actually </v>

3414
02:36:02.441 --> 02:36:07.441
<v Speaker 1>can increase that production.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can increase the gene that converts </v>

3415
02:36:07.441 --> 02:36:10.420
<v Speaker 1>those because women are the ones that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>

3416
02:36:10.421 --> 02:36:15.421
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>carrying the child and Dha is very </v>

3417
02:36:15.421 --> 02:36:15.421
<v Speaker 1>important for the developing brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

3418
02:36:15.421 --> 02:36:16.810
<v Speaker 1>very important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it makes sense that nature would make</v>

3419
02:36:16.811 --> 02:36:19.330
<v Speaker 1>a way to be able to do that with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>plant version.</v>

3420
02:36:20.080 --> 02:36:22.510
<v Speaker 1>But the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that there's been a study that showed</v>

3421
02:36:22.511 --> 02:36:27.511
<v Speaker 1>that people that take preformed Ala </v>
<v Speaker 1>Alpha linolenic acid have to take 33 </v>

3422
02:36:28.031 --> 02:36:33.031
<v Speaker 1>point five times more than preformed Dha</v>
<v Speaker 1>or EPA to get the same amount of Dha and</v>

3423
02:36:33.101 --> 02:36:35.050
<v Speaker 1>EPA in the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a lot.</v>

3424
02:36:35.800 --> 02:36:36.790
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there,</v>

3425
02:36:36.890 --> 02:36:38.800
<v Speaker 1>there are ways around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3426
02:36:39.670 --> 02:36:44.670
<v Speaker 1>there are Vegan or vegetarian friendly </v>
<v Speaker 1>sources which would be micro algae oil.</v>

3427
02:36:44.950 --> 02:36:49.950
<v Speaker 1>I think that I personally think that </v>
<v Speaker 1>vegans and vegetarians should take my </v>

3428
02:36:49.950 --> 02:36:51.480
<v Speaker 1>gradual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I was a Vegan,</v>

3429
02:36:51.490 --> 02:36:54.160
<v Speaker 1>which I can't ever see myself becoming </v>
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>

3430
02:36:54.161 --> 02:36:59.161
<v Speaker 1>but I would absolutely take that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do you not see yourself ever </v>

3431
02:36:59.161 --> 02:37:02.431
<v Speaker 1>becoming one?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because there are important </v>

3432
02:37:02.431 --> 02:37:05.131
<v Speaker 1>micronutrients and neat that are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are important for a variety of </v>

3433
02:37:05.131 --> 02:37:06.730
<v Speaker 1>physiological functions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including the brain,</v>

3434
02:37:06.910 --> 02:37:09.940
<v Speaker 1>red blood cells.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can supplement with some stuff,</v>

3435
02:37:09.941 --> 02:37:14.260
<v Speaker 1>but I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't convinced myself not to to eat</v>

3436
02:37:14.261 --> 02:37:16.040
<v Speaker 1>meat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think with,</v>

3437
02:37:16.100 --> 02:37:17.280
<v Speaker 3>with Vegans,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3438
02:37:17.600 --> 02:37:22.600
<v Speaker 3>vegans,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what they're trying to do is come up </v>

3439
02:37:22.600 --> 02:37:23.450
<v Speaker 3>with a sort of an ethical work around </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're trying to figure out what's,</v>

3440
02:37:23.840 --> 02:37:28.840
<v Speaker 3>how can you be healthy and live a vegan </v>
<v Speaker 3>diet and is it healthy enough and most </v>

3441
02:37:29.211 --> 02:37:32.990
<v Speaker 3>of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least the hardcore proselytizing ones</v>

3442
02:37:33.080 --> 02:37:35.630
<v Speaker 3>seem to think yes and they want </v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody else to do it too.</v>

3443
02:37:37.210 --> 02:37:42.210
<v Speaker 1>There are a lot of benefits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are a lot of positive factors to </v>

3444
02:37:42.690 --> 02:37:47.690
<v Speaker 1>eating a more begun like diet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the fiber you're getting begins.</v>

3445
02:37:48.851 --> 02:37:53.851
<v Speaker 1>I mean I do know there are some begins </v>
<v Speaker 1>at a lot of processed junk so they're </v>

3446
02:37:53.851 --> 02:37:53.851
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3447
02:37:53.851 --> 02:37:55.110
<v Speaker 1>not everyone that's vegans healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not everyone that's omnivores.</v>

3448
02:37:55.190 --> 02:37:57.820
<v Speaker 1>Helping the ones that are eating </v>
<v Speaker 1>healthy,</v>

3449
02:37:58.000 --> 02:38:03.000
<v Speaker 1>they're getting a lot of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're getting a watt wide broad </v>

3450
02:38:03.000 --> 02:38:05.341
<v Speaker 1>spectrum of plants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're getting the different fibers </v>

3451
02:38:05.341 --> 02:38:05.341
<v Speaker 1>that getting into the micro,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're getting the good micronutrients,</v>

3452
02:38:05.341 --> 02:38:06.040
<v Speaker 1>implants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the magnesium,</v>

3453
02:38:06.041 --> 02:38:08.320
<v Speaker 1>the vitaminK ,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the full late a vitamin C,</v>

3454
02:38:08.790 --> 02:38:12.190
<v Speaker 1>and they're getting all the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The hormetic compounds in the plant,</v>

3455
02:38:12.191 --> 02:38:13.630
<v Speaker 1>so those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are really good things,</v>

3456
02:38:13.631 --> 02:38:18.631
<v Speaker 1>but the problem is is that they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're more nutritionally deficient and</v>

3457
02:38:18.821 --> 02:38:23.821
<v Speaker 1>things that most people in the western </v>
<v Speaker 1>world or not because the problem with </v>

3458
02:38:23.821 --> 02:38:28.710
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the United States in general isn't </v>

3459
02:38:28.710 --> 02:38:28.710
<v Speaker 1>that we eat enough meat here.</v>

3460
02:38:28.710 --> 02:38:28.710
<v Speaker 1>Most people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you're Vegan or vegetarian,</v>

3461
02:38:28.710 --> 02:38:33.361
<v Speaker 1>people are eating enough meat there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Problem is people aren't eating enough </v>

3462
02:38:33.361 --> 02:38:35.851
<v Speaker 1>of their Greens and so I usually focus </v>
<v Speaker 1>on micronutrients that are found in </v>

3463
02:38:35.851 --> 02:38:36.810
<v Speaker 1>Greens because that's what people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>not getting enough of,</v>

3464
02:38:37.150 --> 02:38:42.150
<v Speaker 1>but there are important micronutrients </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are in meat that vegans and </v>

3465
02:38:42.971 --> 02:38:47.020
<v Speaker 1>vegetarians are more subject to being </v>
<v Speaker 1>deficient in like be 12.</v>

3466
02:38:47.290 --> 02:38:50.860
<v Speaker 1>So 12 and iron are are two really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really important ones.</v>

3467
02:38:51.190 --> 02:38:53.680
<v Speaker 1>Both of these are very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so b.</v>

3468
02:38:53.681 --> 02:38:58.681
<v Speaker 1>12 is very important for the production </v>
<v Speaker 1>of neurotransmitters and Myelin in the </v>

3469
02:38:59.261 --> 02:39:00.580
<v Speaker 1>brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both iron and B,</v>

3470
02:39:00.581 --> 02:39:05.581
<v Speaker 1>12 hour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most people think of iron as being </v>

3471
02:39:05.581 --> 02:39:05.581
<v Speaker 1>important for your blood cells,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it is,</v>

3472
02:39:05.581 --> 02:39:06.880
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's bound to something called team,</v>

3473
02:39:07.210 --> 02:39:08.500
<v Speaker 1>which is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3474
02:39:08.670 --> 02:39:13.670
<v Speaker 1>a protein inside hemoglobin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's important for transporting oxygen </v>

3475
02:39:13.670 --> 02:39:14.740
<v Speaker 1>to your tissues because you need oxygen </v>
<v Speaker 1>to make energy.</v>

3476
02:39:15.070 --> 02:39:20.070
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the other thing that iron iron is </v>

3477
02:39:20.070 --> 02:39:21.490
<v Speaker 1>doing is it's also important for making </v>
<v Speaker 1>Myelin in the brain.</v>

3478
02:39:21.550 --> 02:39:25.570
<v Speaker 1>Myelin is what surrounds the axons of </v>
<v Speaker 1>your neurons and allow it allows them to</v>

3479
02:39:25.571 --> 02:39:27.670
<v Speaker 1>communicate quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It allows electrical signals,</v>

3480
02:39:28.390 --> 02:39:30.490
<v Speaker 1>signals to be trans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ported quickly.</v>

3481
02:39:31.060 --> 02:39:33.580
<v Speaker 1>So that's important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then make neurotransmitters like you</v>

3482
02:39:33.581 --> 02:39:35.170
<v Speaker 1>need iron to make Serotonin in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>brain.</v>

3483
02:39:35.650 --> 02:39:39.340
<v Speaker 1>And it's one of the reasons why during </v>
<v Speaker 1>pregnancy irons very,</v>

3484
02:39:39.341 --> 02:39:41.360
<v Speaker 1>like if you have iron deficiency during </v>
<v Speaker 1>pregnancy,</v>

3485
02:39:41.390 --> 02:39:46.390
<v Speaker 1>can cause abnormal brain structure or </v>
<v Speaker 1>can cause birth defects because it </v>

3486
02:39:46.390 --> 02:39:48.850
<v Speaker 1>shapes the structure and the wiring of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the brain.</v>

3487
02:39:49.320 --> 02:39:50.140
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's,</v>

3488
02:39:50.460 --> 02:39:55.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously here in the United States we </v>

3489
02:39:55.460 --> 02:39:59.521
<v Speaker 1>have supplements,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have access to supplements and you </v>

3490
02:39:59.521 --> 02:39:59.521
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can take a sublingual,</v>

3491
02:39:59.521 --> 02:39:59.521
<v Speaker 1>b 12,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3492
02:39:59.870 --> 02:40:04.870
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a little bit of a different world </v>

3493
02:40:04.870 --> 02:40:04.870
<v Speaker 1>than it is somewhere in like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>developing country.</v>

3494
02:40:04.870 --> 02:40:06.860
<v Speaker 3>But B12,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's animal base.</v>

3495
02:40:06.861 --> 02:40:09.410
<v Speaker 3>So how are they getting a plant base be </v>
<v Speaker 3>12?</v>

3496
02:40:09.440 --> 02:40:11.360
<v Speaker 3>Is there a plant that has [inaudible] in</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

3497
02:40:11.361 --> 02:40:11.930
<v Speaker 3>in large numbers?</v>

3498
02:40:12.400 --> 02:40:17.400
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so b 12 is actually made a buy back </v>

3499
02:40:17.400 --> 02:40:21.170
<v Speaker 1>certain strains of bacteria.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason to tie in me is because </v>

3500
02:40:21.170 --> 02:40:21.170
<v Speaker 1>it gets me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3501
02:40:21.170 --> 02:40:23.820
<v Speaker 1>animals are predators and so it gets </v>
<v Speaker 1>concentrated in their muscle,</v>

3502
02:40:24.390 --> 02:40:26.040
<v Speaker 1>gets concentrated in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in animal tissue.</v>

3503
02:40:26.250 --> 02:40:27.930
<v Speaker 1>But what about animals that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>herbivores?</v>

3504
02:40:27.960 --> 02:40:30.880
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it still predators?</v>

3505
02:40:31.950 --> 02:40:33.210
<v Speaker 1>Because they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're eating,</v>

3506
02:40:33.930 --> 02:40:36.780
<v Speaker 1>they're eating a variety of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of things that have the,</v>

3507
02:40:36.840 --> 02:40:41.840
<v Speaker 1>the bacteria,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's certain strains of </v>

3508
02:40:41.840 --> 02:40:42.360
<v Speaker 1>mushrooms that have it in order to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're a Vegan or vegetarian,</v>

3509
02:40:42.361 --> 02:40:47.361
<v Speaker 1>you're just eating those mushrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd have to eat an enormous amount to </v>

3510
02:40:47.361 --> 02:40:50.211
<v Speaker 1>get the RDA,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's more concentrated in animal </v>

3511
02:40:50.211 --> 02:40:51.630
<v Speaker 1>meat which are constantly eating it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it gets concentrated in their tissues</v>

3512
02:40:51.631 --> 02:40:56.631
<v Speaker 1>because they are b.</v>
<v Speaker 1>12 is required as a cofactor for a lot </v>

3513
02:40:56.631 --> 02:40:57.870
<v Speaker 1>of enzymes in multiple organs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including their muscles.</v>

3514
02:40:57.871 --> 02:40:59.380
<v Speaker 1>So their muscles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3515
02:40:59.510 --> 02:41:03.150
<v Speaker 1>every time they're eating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever has the be 12 on it,</v>

3516
02:41:03.151 --> 02:41:04.110
<v Speaker 1>they're concentrating it.</v>

3517
02:41:04.470 --> 02:41:07.380
<v Speaker 1>So there are certain types of bacteria </v>
<v Speaker 1>that make be 12,</v>

3518
02:41:07.381 --> 02:41:11.100
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think vegans or vegetarians </v>
<v Speaker 1>can just get it from that.</v>

3519
02:41:11.610 --> 02:41:13.330
<v Speaker 1>They have to eat a lot of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

3520
02:41:13.600 --> 02:41:18.600
<v Speaker 1>like one of those crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the argument that have Vegan can get </v>

3521
02:41:18.600 --> 02:41:22.020
<v Speaker 1>enough v12 from just a standard Vegan </v>
<v Speaker 1>diet without supplementing.</v>

3522
02:41:22.050 --> 02:41:23.640
<v Speaker 1>You don't buy that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3523
02:41:24.120 --> 02:41:25.330
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's,</v>

3524
02:41:25.410 --> 02:41:30.410
<v Speaker 1>there was a study that was done in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Tanzania,</v>

3525
02:41:32.280 --> 02:41:37.280
<v Speaker 1>so there's a few researchers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ucla actually is where I think one of </v>

3526
02:41:37.280 --> 02:41:42.141
<v Speaker 1>them just retired,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's some researchers at Ucla </v>

3527
02:41:42.141 --> 02:41:45.591
<v Speaker 1>that we're studying the effects of b 12 </v>
<v Speaker 1>and iron deficiency on cognition,</v>

3528
02:41:46.740 --> 02:41:47.820
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3529
02:41:48.030 --> 02:41:53.030
<v Speaker 1>learning cognition behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there was a bunch of studies that </v>

3530
02:41:53.030 --> 02:41:56.250
<v Speaker 1>were associative studies like that </v>
<v Speaker 1>crappy premature ejaculation,</v>

3531
02:41:56.251 --> 02:41:57.810
<v Speaker 1>obesity where it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3532
02:41:57.811 --> 02:42:00.270
<v Speaker 1>these two things are associated but we </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know if it's causing.</v>

3533
02:42:00.271 --> 02:42:01.980
<v Speaker 1>And so there was an association with low</v>
<v Speaker 1>B,</v>

3534
02:42:01.981 --> 02:42:06.450
<v Speaker 1>Twelve low iron and poor Iq,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lower Iq,</v>

3535
02:42:06.690 --> 02:42:08.970
<v Speaker 1>poor cognition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>poor behavior.</v>

3536
02:42:09.570 --> 02:42:11.940
<v Speaker 1>But there was no real causal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3537
02:42:11.941 --> 02:42:14.210
<v Speaker 1>roll identified.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so these,</v>

3538
02:42:14.280 --> 02:42:19.280
<v Speaker 1>there's a couple of researchers at ucla </v>
<v Speaker 1>that did two different clinical trials </v>

3539
02:42:19.280 --> 02:42:20.530
<v Speaker 1>where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3540
02:42:20.970 --> 02:42:25.970
<v Speaker 1>there was 12 different schools in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Tanzania that were selected and these </v>

3541
02:42:25.970 --> 02:42:27.540
<v Speaker 1>clinical trials lasted two years and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there was two of them.</v>

3542
02:42:27.630 --> 02:42:32.630
<v Speaker 1>The first trial was 575 kids are around </v>
<v Speaker 1>600 and the other one was like 370 </v>

3543
02:42:33.691 --> 02:42:38.691
<v Speaker 1>something so closer to 400.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So total we're talking a total of about </v>

3544
02:42:38.691 --> 02:42:38.691
<v Speaker 1>a thousand children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>School children,</v>

3545
02:42:38.700 --> 02:42:40.140
<v Speaker 1>like these were elementary school </v>
<v Speaker 1>children.</v>

3546
02:42:40.920 --> 02:42:43.620
<v Speaker 1>And the typical thing they eat in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Tanzania is,</v>

3547
02:42:43.621 --> 02:42:44.940
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a porridge,</v>

3548
02:42:44.970 --> 02:42:49.970
<v Speaker 1>I forgot the name of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a porridge and it has </v>

3549
02:42:49.970 --> 02:42:52.461
<v Speaker 1>vegetables,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has beans and it has corn and that's </v>

3550
02:42:52.461 --> 02:42:56.481
<v Speaker 1>their standard porch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what the trial was designed with </v>

3551
02:42:56.481 --> 02:42:56.481
<v Speaker 1>the school kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to give it.</v>

3552
02:42:56.481 --> 02:42:57.900
<v Speaker 1>They were given a snack every single day</v>
<v Speaker 1>for two years,</v>

3553
02:42:58.140 --> 02:43:03.140
<v Speaker 1>either the porridge or they got the </v>
<v Speaker 1>porch with a glass of milk or they got </v>

3554
02:43:03.140 --> 02:43:03.660
<v Speaker 1>the porridge with meat.</v>

3555
02:43:04.680 --> 02:43:09.660
<v Speaker 1>And every three to six months there were</v>
<v Speaker 1>arithmetic and reading tests done.</v>

3556
02:43:09.780 --> 02:43:13.360
<v Speaker 1>So they were looking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to measure cognitive performance.</v>

3557
02:43:13.920 --> 02:43:14.880
<v Speaker 1>And there was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3558
02:43:14.920 --> 02:43:16.990
<v Speaker 1>they measured physical performance and </v>
<v Speaker 1>muscle mass.</v>

3559
02:43:17.610 --> 02:43:18.460
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

3560
02:43:18.520 --> 02:43:23.440
<v Speaker 1>and what the results were of this study </v>
<v Speaker 1>was that the porridge with the meat.</v>

3561
02:43:23.441 --> 02:43:27.370
<v Speaker 1>So the school children that were eating </v>
<v Speaker 1>the meat with the porridge scored better</v>

3562
02:43:27.520 --> 02:43:29.230
<v Speaker 1>on math,</v>
<v Speaker 1>arithmetic.</v>

3563
02:43:29.231 --> 02:43:32.710
<v Speaker 1>They scored better on reading tests.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had larger,</v>

3564
02:43:32.740 --> 02:43:36.420
<v Speaker 1>they have more muscle mass and they grew</v>
<v Speaker 1>more than the other school children that</v>

3565
02:43:36.430 --> 02:43:38.350
<v Speaker 1>did not get the meat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they also.</v>

3566
02:43:38.351 --> 02:43:41.170
<v Speaker 1>So that's all quantitative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3567
02:43:41.171 --> 02:43:46.171
<v Speaker 1>they also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were more likely to exhibit </v>

3568
02:43:46.171 --> 02:43:47.000
<v Speaker 1>leadership qualities out in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>playground.</v>

3569
02:43:47.030 --> 02:43:48.670
<v Speaker 1>That's a little more subjective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>subjective,</v>

3570
02:43:48.671 --> 02:43:52.480
<v Speaker 1>but still interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the bottom line here is that,</v>

3571
02:43:52.481 --> 02:43:54.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously in Tanzania they're not,</v>

3572
02:43:54.430 --> 02:43:56.300
<v Speaker 1>they're not supplementing or not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3573
02:43:56.440 --> 02:43:58.240
<v Speaker 1>taking b,</v>
<v Speaker 1>12 iron and they're also,</v>

3574
02:43:58.630 --> 02:44:02.050
<v Speaker 1>there's also essential amino acids that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are present neat,</v>

3575
02:44:02.110 --> 02:44:04.840
<v Speaker 1>which our bodies can't make,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are found in some.</v>

3576
02:44:04.840 --> 02:44:08.890
<v Speaker 1>You can find some plant sources of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like keen water or hempseed has it,</v>

3577
02:44:09.250 --> 02:44:11.530
<v Speaker 1>but they're not supplementing with that </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff over in Tanzania.</v>

3578
02:44:11.531 --> 02:44:14.890
<v Speaker 1>So if you don't have access to those </v>
<v Speaker 1>things and you're just eating vegetables</v>

3579
02:44:14.891 --> 02:44:19.891
<v Speaker 1>and beans and corn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you will have nutritional </v>

3580
02:44:19.891 --> 02:44:20.260
<v Speaker 1>deficiencies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the question is,</v>

3581
02:44:20.350 --> 02:44:22.030
<v Speaker 1>if those children were given a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>b,</v>

3582
02:44:22.031 --> 02:44:25.210
<v Speaker 1>12 supplement or iron,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would that have made a difference?</v>

3583
02:44:25.211 --> 02:44:26.650
<v Speaker 1>Probably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it probably would have.</v>

3584
02:44:26.651 --> 02:44:31.651
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's been studies in the United </v>

3585
02:44:31.651 --> 02:44:33.210
<v Speaker 1>States that have been done on school </v>
<v Speaker 1>children that have been deficient in </v>

3586
02:44:33.210 --> 02:44:35.641
<v Speaker 1>certain micronutrients and they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>given a multivitamin and an Omega three </v>

3587
02:44:35.641 --> 02:44:38.911
<v Speaker 1>supplement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fish oil and they only the ones that </v>

3588
02:44:38.911 --> 02:44:41.791
<v Speaker 1>were deficient to begin with improved,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like did better on reading and </v>

3589
02:44:41.791 --> 02:44:45.480
<v Speaker 1>arithmetic test.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's definitely an argument to be </v>

3590
02:44:45.480 --> 02:44:45.670
<v Speaker 1>made there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think,</v>

3591
02:44:46.400 --> 02:44:48.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think for Vegetarians,</v>

3592
02:44:48.160 --> 02:44:49.060
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3593
02:44:49.061 --> 02:44:50.470
<v Speaker 1>we live in a very different time.</v>

3594
02:44:50.530 --> 02:44:55.530
<v Speaker 1>Obviously there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's protein powders and keenwah on </v>

3595
02:44:55.530 --> 02:44:59.540
<v Speaker 1>hemp seed and be 12 sublingual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what are they getting [inaudible] </v>

3596
02:44:59.540 --> 02:45:00.680
<v Speaker 1>from?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's a Vegan based,</v>

3597
02:45:01.850 --> 02:45:03.190
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3598
02:45:03.280 --> 02:45:05.470
<v Speaker 1>is that like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think possible.</v>

3599
02:45:05.810 --> 02:45:08.670
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was just like methyl </v>
<v Speaker 1>cobalamin.</v>

3600
02:45:08.710 --> 02:45:10.980
<v Speaker 1>So I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that there's,</v>

3601
02:45:11.140 --> 02:45:12.220
<v Speaker 1>it's not me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

3602
02:45:12.640 --> 02:45:16.120
<v Speaker 1>it's just synthetic be 12.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How would they synthesizing it?</v>

3603
02:45:16.540 --> 02:45:19.540
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going beyond my knowledge base,</v>

3604
02:45:20.310 --> 02:45:25.300
<v Speaker 1>but so there it is possible to get both </v>
<v Speaker 1>iron and b 12 from.</v>

3605
02:45:25.410 --> 02:45:26.260
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so b,</v>

3606
02:45:26.261 --> 02:45:27.030
<v Speaker 1>12 is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3607
02:45:27.031 --> 02:45:29.930
<v Speaker 1>not a lot of vegetarians supplement with</v>
<v Speaker 1>b 12.</v>

3608
02:45:29.950 --> 02:45:34.950
<v Speaker 1>I mean they know and sublinguals </v>
<v Speaker 1>important because there's also gene </v>

3609
02:45:34.950 --> 02:45:36.130
<v Speaker 1>polymorphisms that affect the way your </v>
<v Speaker 1>gut absorbs be 12.</v>

3610
02:45:36.280 --> 02:45:38.070
<v Speaker 1>So people have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3611
02:45:38.320 --> 02:45:43.320
<v Speaker 1>to bypass that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can put it onto your soul </v>

3612
02:45:43.320 --> 02:45:43.320
<v Speaker 1>sublinguals the optimal way to take it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3613
02:45:43.320 --> 02:45:44.140
<v Speaker 1>I think for anyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if someone's a Vegan,</v>

3614
02:45:44.141 --> 02:45:49.141
<v Speaker 1>what are the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are the supplements that they </v>

3615
02:45:49.141 --> 02:45:49.141
<v Speaker 1>should take?</v>

3616
02:45:49.141 --> 02:45:49.141
<v Speaker 1>You think b12 iron wood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3617
02:45:49.141 --> 02:45:50.260
<v Speaker 1>Well with the iron is kind of tricky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just want to mention,</v>

3618
02:45:50.261 --> 02:45:51.310
<v Speaker 1>because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>iron,</v>

3619
02:45:51.640 --> 02:45:56.640
<v Speaker 1>a lot of vegans think that they can get </v>
<v Speaker 1>their iron from their diet because iron </v>

3620
02:45:56.640 --> 02:45:57.630
<v Speaker 1>is also found in beans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

3621
02:45:57.670 --> 02:45:59.140
<v Speaker 1>it's in plants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's in Spanish,</v>

3622
02:45:59.141 --> 02:46:02.350
<v Speaker 1>but the way it's bound,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's bound in something called phytate,</v>

3623
02:46:02.800 --> 02:46:07.800
<v Speaker 1>which we cannot digest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the bioavailability of iron is </v>

3624
02:46:08.350 --> 02:46:13.350
<v Speaker 1>one point eight times less in plant form</v>
<v Speaker 1>than in meet me.</v>

3625
02:46:13.881 --> 02:46:15.830
<v Speaker 1>It's bound to something called Heme,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which gives,</v>

3626
02:46:16.700 --> 02:46:20.210
<v Speaker 1>it gives blood cells that are red color,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is why red meat has more of it,</v>

3627
02:46:20.480 --> 02:46:22.430
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that are,</v>

3628
02:46:23.240 --> 02:46:28.240
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are vegetarian that think they're </v>

3629
02:46:28.240 --> 02:46:30.821
<v Speaker 1>getting enough iron,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really think they should get their </v>

3630
02:46:30.821 --> 02:46:33.161
<v Speaker 1>levels measured.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So women lose a lot of iron during </v>

3631
02:46:33.161 --> 02:46:33.161
<v Speaker 1>menstruation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>

3632
02:46:33.161 --> 02:46:35.570
<v Speaker 1>so the RDA for iron for men is eight </v>
<v Speaker 1>milligrams a day for women.</v>

3633
02:46:35.570 --> 02:46:38.780
<v Speaker 1>It's 18 went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so already on top of that,</v>

3634
02:46:38.781 --> 02:46:43.781
<v Speaker 1>if you're a vegetarian or Vegan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>multiplying by one point eight is </v>

3635
02:46:43.781 --> 02:46:47.210
<v Speaker 1>already important if you're just getting</v>
<v Speaker 1>it from food because the bioavailability</v>

3636
02:46:47.211 --> 02:46:49.820
<v Speaker 1>of iron is almost two fold less than </v>
<v Speaker 1>from me.</v>

3637
02:46:49.880 --> 02:46:51.570
<v Speaker 1>So that's one thing to consider.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

3638
02:46:51.670 --> 02:46:56.670
<v Speaker 1>and the other thing is also an athletes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you're like an endurance </v>

3639
02:46:56.670 --> 02:46:57.470
<v Speaker 1>athlete,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you actually,</v>

3640
02:46:57.471 --> 02:47:02.471
<v Speaker 1>a hemo lysis occurs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Red Blood cells lice when you're doing </v>

3641
02:47:02.471 --> 02:47:06.131
<v Speaker 1>like very intense endurance training and</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you lose iron there too because </v>

3642
02:47:06.131 --> 02:47:10.381
<v Speaker 1>you'll lose losing red blood cells.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Iron is tricky because you don't want </v>

3643
02:47:10.381 --> 02:47:14.530
<v Speaker 1>too much of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like if you're supplementing like </v>

3644
02:47:14.530 --> 02:47:14.530
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no guesswork here.</v>

3645
02:47:14.530 --> 02:47:17.510
<v Speaker 1>There's no guesswork with iron.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Having so having too much,</v>

3646
02:47:17.511 --> 02:47:20.300
<v Speaker 1>when you take too much free,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like supplemental iron,</v>

3647
02:47:20.480 --> 02:47:21.650
<v Speaker 1>it can cause,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3648
02:47:21.890 --> 02:47:24.830
<v Speaker 1>free iron inside yourselves and that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>like dynamite.</v>

3649
02:47:24.830 --> 02:47:28.430
<v Speaker 1>That's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it reacts with enzymes in your body</v>

3650
02:47:28.431 --> 02:47:32.720
<v Speaker 1>and it screws up energy production.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It causes lots of damage.</v>

3651
02:47:32.790 --> 02:47:33.770
<v Speaker 1>So it's really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really bad,</v>

3652
02:47:33.830 --> 02:47:38.830
<v Speaker 1>really bad to get to my drug.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is supplemental iron from actual </v>

3653
02:47:38.830 --> 02:47:39.890
<v Speaker 1>sources.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Notes tightly regulated,</v>

3654
02:47:40.100 --> 02:47:41.720
<v Speaker 1>but when you start to do supplemental </v>
<v Speaker 1>iron,</v>

3655
02:47:41.721 --> 02:47:43.250
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think that,</v>

3656
02:47:43.251 --> 02:47:44.930
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then there's Jane Pauley,</v>

3657
02:47:44.960 --> 02:47:46.840
<v Speaker 1>some people like Dan has one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3658
02:47:46.890 --> 02:47:51.890
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen lots of people's DNA where </v>

3659
02:47:51.890 --> 02:47:54.041
<v Speaker 1>they have a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a variation in a gene that can </v>

3660
02:47:54.041 --> 02:47:55.160
<v Speaker 1>lead to too much iron overload.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3661
02:47:55.430 --> 02:47:56.810
<v Speaker 1>it's called hematic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chroma,</v>

3662
02:47:56.870 --> 02:47:58.470
<v Speaker 1>hemochromatosis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

3663
02:47:58.670 --> 02:48:00.590
<v Speaker 1>and it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is very common.</v>

3664
02:48:00.850 --> 02:48:01.700
<v Speaker 1>And if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're,</v>

3665
02:48:01.701 --> 02:48:04.130
<v Speaker 1>if you have one of those jeans and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're taking supplemental iron,</v>

3666
02:48:04.670 --> 02:48:07.580
<v Speaker 1>you have even more free irons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very bad,</v>

3667
02:48:07.850 --> 02:48:12.850
<v Speaker 1>very bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think that people should </v>

3668
02:48:12.850 --> 02:48:12.850
<v Speaker 1>definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what all the blood levels,</v>

3669
02:48:12.850 --> 02:48:13.760
<v Speaker 1>there's different markers that you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>measure,</v>

3670
02:48:13.761 --> 02:48:18.761
<v Speaker 1>your physician will know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but getting iron levels measured is </v>

3671
02:48:18.761 --> 02:48:18.761
<v Speaker 1>important.</v>

3672
02:48:18.761 --> 02:48:20.870
<v Speaker 1>If you're gonna start supplementing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you do supplement with Arne,</v>

3673
02:48:20.890 --> 02:48:23.750
<v Speaker 1>is it important to take it with food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

3674
02:48:23.770 --> 02:48:26.050
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with fats like what is,</v>

3675
02:48:26.100 --> 02:48:29.270
<v Speaker 1>what is the absorption?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Vitamin C,</v>

3676
02:48:29.480 --> 02:48:34.480
<v Speaker 1>Vitamin C,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm dramatically increases the </v>

3677
02:48:34.480 --> 02:48:37.151
<v Speaker 1>absorption of non heme iron.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So hire an iron that's not found in </v>

3678
02:48:37.151 --> 02:48:38.900
<v Speaker 1>meat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So even actually people vegetarians that</v>

3679
02:48:38.901 --> 02:48:40.790
<v Speaker 1>are eating a bunch of beans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>legumes,</v>

3680
02:48:41.260 --> 02:48:46.260
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all they needed to get one one </v>

3681
02:48:46.260 --> 02:48:46.260
<v Speaker 1>point eight times more than they would </v>
<v Speaker 1>have meat,</v>

3682
02:48:46.260 --> 02:48:50.651
<v Speaker 1>but they also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they eat it with a citrus fruit or </v>

3683
02:48:50.651 --> 02:48:51.860
<v Speaker 1>have some berries or Broccoli's high in </v>
<v Speaker 1>vitamin C habit with your beans,</v>

3684
02:48:52.010 --> 02:48:53.410
<v Speaker 1>that would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would make a,</v>

3685
02:48:53.480 --> 02:48:56.330
<v Speaker 1>make a difference in increasing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bioavailability of iron.</v>

3686
02:48:56.720 --> 02:49:01.720
<v Speaker 1>So that would be important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a fascinating aspect of food </v>

3687
02:49:01.720 --> 02:49:04.571
<v Speaker 1>supplementary or supplementation is </v>
<v Speaker 1>eating it with the right foods and </v>

3688
02:49:04.571 --> 02:49:05.040
<v Speaker 1>making sure that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3689
02:49:05.060 --> 02:49:09.000
<v Speaker 1>some things you don't want to eat with </v>
<v Speaker 1>any food at all and some things you want</v>

3690
02:49:09.001 --> 02:49:11.130
<v Speaker 1>to have on a full stomach or you want </v>
<v Speaker 1>fat.</v>

3691
02:49:11.360 --> 02:49:13.950
<v Speaker 1>The fat soluble vitamins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>carotinoids,</v>

3692
02:49:13.951 --> 02:49:15.560
<v Speaker 1>even vitamin D.</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3693
02:49:15.650 --> 02:49:18.870
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the vitamins that are soluble in fat are</v>

3694
02:49:19.500 --> 02:49:22.260
<v Speaker 1>the bioavailability is increased when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you take it with fat.</v>

3695
02:49:22.920 --> 02:49:27.920
<v Speaker 1>And so that would be another one </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually a lot of vegetarians probably </v>

3696
02:49:27.920 --> 02:49:29.730
<v Speaker 1>think they're getting enough vitamin a </v>
<v Speaker 1>because Beta carotene,</v>

3697
02:49:29.731 --> 02:49:32.880
<v Speaker 1>which is in plants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can be converted into vitamin A.</v>

3698
02:49:32.880 --> 02:49:34.840
<v Speaker 1>Vitamin a gets is actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3699
02:49:35.700 --> 02:49:40.700
<v Speaker 1>it actually becomes a hormone and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>works much like Vitamin d not quite the </v>

3700
02:49:40.700 --> 02:49:41.610
<v Speaker 1>same,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it does change,</v>

3701
02:49:41.640 --> 02:49:43.470
<v Speaker 1>it activates genes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>turns genes off,</v>

3702
02:49:43.471 --> 02:49:48.471
<v Speaker 1>does all this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's very important for immune </v>

3703
02:49:48.471 --> 02:49:48.471
<v Speaker 1>function,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for your eye,</v>

3704
02:49:48.471 --> 02:49:48.780
<v Speaker 1>for vision,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there are,</v>

3705
02:49:48.781 --> 02:49:49.500
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to,</v>

3706
02:49:49.650 --> 02:49:53.190
<v Speaker 1>the bioavailability of Beta carotene is </v>
<v Speaker 1>very low.</v>

3707
02:49:53.220 --> 02:49:56.670
<v Speaker 1>We don't absorb it very well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That increases that bioavailability.</v>

3708
02:49:56.671 --> 02:49:58.890
<v Speaker 1>So taken with that because they are fat </v>
<v Speaker 1>soluble,</v>

3709
02:49:59.190 --> 02:50:00.630
<v Speaker 1>the carotenoids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Beta carotenes,</v>

3710
02:50:00.631 --> 02:50:01.920
<v Speaker 1>fat soluble,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and also,</v>

3711
02:50:01.921 --> 02:50:06.030
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are gene polymorphisms that people</v>

3712
02:50:06.031 --> 02:50:09.870
<v Speaker 1>have so they don't convert Beta carotene</v>
<v Speaker 1>into vitamin a very well.</v>

3713
02:50:09.870 --> 02:50:12.600
<v Speaker 1>Like my brother in law has one where he </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't at all very well.</v>

3714
02:50:12.601 --> 02:50:17.601
<v Speaker 1>So he has to actually get vitamin a from</v>
<v Speaker 1>an animal source or you can get retinal </v>

3715
02:50:18.721 --> 02:50:19.740
<v Speaker 1>acetate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

3716
02:50:19.741 --> 02:50:24.741
<v Speaker 1>I think it's synthetic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's something that some </v>

3717
02:50:24.741 --> 02:50:24.741
<v Speaker 1>vegetarians may consider,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>

3718
02:50:24.741 --> 02:50:26.040
<v Speaker 1>not all of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but some just considering whether or not</v>

3719
02:50:26.041 --> 02:50:29.580
<v Speaker 1>they have that gene polymorphism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the main ones are iron B,</v>

3720
02:50:29.581 --> 02:50:33.480
<v Speaker 1>12,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Omega three and vitamin D there,</v>

3721
02:50:33.560 --> 02:50:35.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>70 percent of the population doesn't get</v>

3722
02:50:35.761 --> 02:50:40.761
<v Speaker 1>enough vitamin D,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but vegetarians often think they're </v>

3723
02:50:40.761 --> 02:50:41.700
<v Speaker 1>getting enough vitamin D because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>make it from the sun.</v>

3724
02:50:42.270 --> 02:50:43.490
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem is,</v>

3725
02:50:43.491 --> 02:50:48.491
<v Speaker 1>is that so many factors regulate that </v>
<v Speaker 1>because a uvb radiation has to hit your </v>

3726
02:50:48.781 --> 02:50:53.781
<v Speaker 1>skin to make it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if your wearing sunscreen or you </v>

3727
02:50:53.781 --> 02:50:54.060
<v Speaker 1>have um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of melanin,</v>

3728
02:50:54.061 --> 02:50:59.061
<v Speaker 1>so if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got like dark pigmentation that </v>

3729
02:50:59.061 --> 02:50:59.061
<v Speaker 1>blocks it out latitude where you live.</v>

3730
02:50:59.061 --> 02:51:03.680
<v Speaker 1>So uvb rays,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like don't hit the atmosphere certain </v>

3731
02:51:03.680 --> 02:51:04.610
<v Speaker 1>times of the year in certain regions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

3732
02:51:04.620 --> 02:51:08.610
<v Speaker 1>you're only three or four months out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the year can make Vitamin d from the sun</v>

3733
02:51:08.611 --> 02:51:10.050
<v Speaker 1>and then age,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3734
02:51:10.051 --> 02:51:15.051
<v Speaker 1>as you get older,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a 70 year old makes only 25 percent of </v>

3735
02:51:15.051 --> 02:51:16.440
<v Speaker 1>the vitamin D that they made when they </v>
<v Speaker 1>were 20 years old.</v>

3736
02:51:16.750 --> 02:51:17.670
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3737
02:51:17.671 --> 02:51:20.730
<v Speaker 1>So all these factors play a role and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there is a vitamin.</v>

3738
02:51:20.731 --> 02:51:25.731
<v Speaker 1>I know I was talking to Rachel about </v>
<v Speaker 1>this because vitamin D supplements d </v>

3739
02:51:25.731 --> 02:51:27.920
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the plant form is [inaudible].</v>

3740
02:51:28.390 --> 02:51:33.390
<v Speaker 1>It's made by mushrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mushrooms also make vitamin D when </v>

3741
02:51:33.390 --> 02:51:35.811
<v Speaker 1>they're exposed to sun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The plant form doesn't get converted </v>

3742
02:51:35.811 --> 02:51:37.590
<v Speaker 1>into the hormone very well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also there's been two recent studies</v>

3743
02:51:37.591 --> 02:51:42.591
<v Speaker 1>that have shown that [inaudible] may </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually inhibit a [inaudible] function </v>

3744
02:51:42.591 --> 02:51:47.151
<v Speaker 1>and muscle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it actually has negative effects in </v>

3745
02:51:47.151 --> 02:51:47.580
<v Speaker 1>muscle tissue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Taking too much do too.</v>

3746
02:51:47.640 --> 02:51:48.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So [inaudible] is the,</v>

3747
02:51:48.811 --> 02:51:53.811
<v Speaker 1>is the best supplement form and most of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the [inaudible] on the markets from </v>

3748
02:51:54.450 --> 02:51:58.260
<v Speaker 1>lanolin which is secreted from sheep </v>
<v Speaker 1>skin or something.</v>

3749
02:51:58.261 --> 02:52:00.210
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's Vegan friendly.</v>

3750
02:52:00.211 --> 02:52:05.211
<v Speaker 1>But there is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is a type of algae Lichen Lichen </v>

3751
02:52:05.211 --> 02:52:10.200
<v Speaker 1>that that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that makes vitamin D and lincolns and </v>

3752
02:52:10.200 --> 02:52:10.200
<v Speaker 1>algae.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what it is.</v>

3753
02:52:10.200 --> 02:52:14.750
<v Speaker 1>White plant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it weird funky stuff that grows </v>

3754
02:52:14.750 --> 02:52:14.750
<v Speaker 1>fungus?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alaska?</v>

3755
02:52:15.160 --> 02:52:17.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a moss almost.</v>

3756
02:52:18.050 --> 02:52:19.180
<v Speaker 1>Let me pull that up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Liking.</v>

3757
02:52:19.670 --> 02:52:20.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's something that,</v>

3758
02:52:20.891 --> 02:52:25.891
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know Caribou eat a lot of black tail </v>

3759
02:52:25.891 --> 02:52:26.470
<v Speaker 1>deer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's like a white,</v>

3760
02:52:26.560 --> 02:52:30.490
<v Speaker 1>tasteless sort of a grass that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>exist or not a grasp,</v>

3761
02:52:30.491 --> 02:52:31.720
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost like a,</v>

3762
02:52:32.930 --> 02:52:35.200
<v Speaker 1>it's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's weird plant here.</v>

3763
02:52:36.010 --> 02:52:38.120
<v Speaker 1>That's what it looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does that,</v>

3764
02:52:38.850 --> 02:52:42.700
<v Speaker 1>that was kind of weird looking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's weird stuff.</v>

3765
02:52:43.540 --> 02:52:45.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You find it all over the place on Prince</v>

3766
02:52:45.521 --> 02:52:50.521
<v Speaker 1>Edward Island in Alaska was the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>place I came in contact with it and I </v>

3767
02:52:50.521 --> 02:52:50.521
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is this?</v>

3768
02:52:50.521 --> 02:52:53.080
<v Speaker 1>And then we'll this black tail deer eat </v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of,</v>

3769
02:52:53.680 --> 02:52:58.520
<v Speaker 1>some kind of a plant so you can get </v>
<v Speaker 1>three from that because the company that</v>

3770
02:52:58.570 --> 02:53:03.570
<v Speaker 1>makes teeth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there are vegan friendly sources of </v>

3771
02:53:03.570 --> 02:53:03.570
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if,</v>

3772
02:53:03.570 --> 02:53:07.440
<v Speaker 1>if they do want to eat Vegan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is possible to get a fully balanced </v>

3773
02:53:07.440 --> 02:53:08.680
<v Speaker 1>diet and protein would be the other way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other thing,</v>

3774
02:53:08.681 --> 02:53:13.681
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The essential amino acids are typically </v>

3775
02:53:13.681 --> 02:53:15.370
<v Speaker 1>found in animal protein.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So getting,</v>

3776
02:53:15.440 --> 02:53:17.650
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so those are like leucine,</v>

3777
02:53:17.950 --> 02:53:19.420
<v Speaker 1>leucine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tryptophan,</v>

3778
02:53:20.380 --> 02:53:21.330
<v Speaker 1>penal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alanine,</v>

3779
02:53:21.370 --> 02:53:22.300
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's nine of them,</v>

3780
02:53:22.301 --> 02:53:27.301
<v Speaker 1>but just exist some really low doses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in most plant based proteins,</v>

3781
02:53:28.181 --> 02:53:31.120
<v Speaker 1>is that what the problem is?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know the very,</v>

3782
02:53:31.121 --> 02:53:32.650
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very low doses,</v>

3783
02:53:32.651 --> 02:53:34.720
<v Speaker 1>but you can get some that have higher </v>
<v Speaker 1>doses.</v>

3784
02:53:35.830 --> 02:53:40.830
<v Speaker 1>It's hemp seed and then chemo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So those are the only two now I'm sure </v>

3785
02:53:40.830 --> 02:53:41.870
<v Speaker 1>there's more than enough.</v>

3786
02:53:41.960 --> 02:53:46.960
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they have like really a full amino </v>

3787
02:53:46.960 --> 02:53:49.570
<v Speaker 1>acid profile and they have the essential</v>
<v Speaker 1>ones that you need.</v>

3788
02:53:49.610 --> 02:53:54.610
<v Speaker 1>And keep in mind the essential proteins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what's the branch chain amino </v>

3789
02:53:54.610 --> 02:53:57.931
<v Speaker 1>acids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what that actually taken up into </v>

3790
02:53:57.931 --> 02:53:57.931
<v Speaker 1>muscle cells.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

3791
02:53:57.931 --> 02:53:58.930
<v Speaker 1>And there's been studies that have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>done just getting,</v>

3792
02:53:58.960 --> 02:54:02.350
<v Speaker 1>doing plant protein without the </v>
<v Speaker 1>essential amino acids.</v>

3793
02:54:02.570 --> 02:54:07.570
<v Speaker 1>Does not do not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't gain muscle mass after doing </v>

3794
02:54:07.570 --> 02:54:11.341
<v Speaker 1>strength training like you can if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>take in the essential amino acids </v>

3795
02:54:11.341 --> 02:54:15.901
<v Speaker 1>because that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need those to be taken up into </v>

3796
02:54:15.901 --> 02:54:18.241
<v Speaker 1>muscle to build proteins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well there's some of the weird Vegan </v>

3797
02:54:18.241 --> 02:54:20.500
<v Speaker 1>arguments that they repeat almost as if </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fact,</v>

3798
02:54:20.501 --> 02:54:25.501
<v Speaker 1>but that's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of them was that saturated fats </v>

3799
02:54:25.501 --> 02:54:26.200
<v Speaker 1>and saturated fats are somehow or </v>
<v Speaker 1>another bad for you.</v>

3800
02:54:27.230 --> 02:54:31.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's a very confusing literature.</v>

3801
02:54:31.961 --> 02:54:36.961
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm saturated fats in and of </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves aren't necessarily bad unless</v>

3802
02:54:38.981 --> 02:54:39.550
<v Speaker 1>you have.</v>

3803
02:54:39.610 --> 02:54:42.970
<v Speaker 1>There are certain gene polymorphisms in </v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3804
02:54:43.150 --> 02:54:45.100
<v Speaker 1>so PPR,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alpha,</v>

3805
02:54:45.130 --> 02:54:47.260
<v Speaker 1>Ppr,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gamma fto genes,</v>

3806
02:54:47.830 --> 02:54:52.830
<v Speaker 1>if you have a gene polymorphism in one </v>
<v Speaker 1>of these three genes because in order </v>

3807
02:54:54.251 --> 02:54:54.890
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3808
02:54:55.060 --> 02:55:00.060
<v Speaker 1>when you eat diet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>saturated fat and it needs to be </v>

3809
02:55:00.060 --> 02:55:00.060
<v Speaker 1>metabolized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>transported to the right place,</v>

3810
02:55:00.060 --> 02:55:01.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't want it just sitting around in</v>

3811
02:55:01.620 --> 02:55:03.590
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as fatty acids in bloodstream.</v>

3812
02:55:03.890 --> 02:55:05.420
<v Speaker 1>Will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those jeans that I just mentioned,</v>

3813
02:55:05.421 --> 02:55:10.421
<v Speaker 1>they play a role in doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people don't activate them very </v>

3814
02:55:10.421 --> 02:55:11.360
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so if they have a high saturated fat</v>

3815
02:55:11.361 --> 02:55:14.000
<v Speaker 1>and a low poly or mono unsaturated fat </v>
<v Speaker 1>intake,</v>

3816
02:55:14.450 --> 02:55:17.270
<v Speaker 1>they can actually have increased type </v>
<v Speaker 1>two diabetes.</v>

3817
02:55:17.271 --> 02:55:22.271
<v Speaker 1>They can have poor glucose response </v>
<v Speaker 1>because fatty acids are sitting around </v>

3818
02:55:22.271 --> 02:55:25.640
<v Speaker 1>in their bloodstream and antagonizing </v>
<v Speaker 1>the insulin receptor I'm doing,</v>

3819
02:55:25.670 --> 02:55:30.670
<v Speaker 1>doing all sorts of things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if they have a higher </v>

3820
02:55:30.670 --> 02:55:33.250
<v Speaker 1>polyunsaturated fat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is found in fish or nuts or mono </v>

3821
02:55:33.250 --> 02:55:34.520
<v Speaker 1>unsaturated fat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so abakada autos,</v>

3822
02:55:34.850 --> 02:55:36.020
<v Speaker 1>nuts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>olive oil.</v>

3823
02:55:36.230 --> 02:55:41.230
<v Speaker 1>If they have a higher ratio of those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it activates those genes more and </v>

3824
02:55:41.230 --> 02:55:41.580
<v Speaker 1>so they don't actually have those </v>
<v Speaker 1>negative effects,</v>

3825
02:55:41.581 --> 02:55:43.640
<v Speaker 1>so that's one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the smaller thing.</v>

3826
02:55:43.820 --> 02:55:47.210
<v Speaker 1>The real problem with saturated fat is </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually sugar.</v>

3827
02:55:48.740 --> 02:55:49.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

3828
02:55:49.551 --> 02:55:50.360
<v Speaker 1>the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's.</v>

3829
02:55:50.480 --> 02:55:55.480
<v Speaker 1>The problem is is that saturated fat </v>
<v Speaker 1>increases the production of ldl </v>

3830
02:55:55.581 --> 02:56:00.581
<v Speaker 1>cholesterol,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which isn't necessarily bad unless you </v>

3831
02:56:00.581 --> 02:56:04.271
<v Speaker 1>have massive inflammation from eating </v>
<v Speaker 1>refined carbohydrates and specifically </v>

3832
02:56:04.271 --> 02:56:06.200
<v Speaker 1>from eating sucrose or fructose corn </v>
<v Speaker 1>syrup,</v>

3833
02:56:06.860 --> 02:56:09.050
<v Speaker 1>and this has been shown actually a </v>
<v Speaker 1>colleague of mine,</v>

3834
02:56:09.051 --> 02:56:13.820
<v Speaker 1>Ron Kraus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a brilliant cardio cardiologist and</v>

3835
02:56:13.821 --> 02:56:18.821
<v Speaker 1>he's actually one of the guys that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>discovered a a test to measure what </v>

3836
02:56:20.541 --> 02:56:23.930
<v Speaker 1>really the bad part of cholesterol,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which isn't just ldl.</v>

3837
02:56:23.931 --> 02:56:28.931
<v Speaker 1>It's actually a small dense particle and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that small dense particles formed only </v>

3838
02:56:29.210 --> 02:56:34.210
<v Speaker 1>when you have have the saturated fat </v>
<v Speaker 1>plus the high fructose corn syrup or the</v>

3839
02:56:34.311 --> 02:56:36.530
<v Speaker 1>refined sugar because it's causing </v>
<v Speaker 1>inflammation.</v>

3840
02:56:36.530 --> 02:56:38.750
<v Speaker 1>So I did a podcast with him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a little technical,</v>

3841
02:56:39.560 --> 02:56:41.990
<v Speaker 1>but like my mother in law,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>

3842
02:56:42.050 --> 02:56:45.710
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she watched the video and she had done a</v>

3843
02:56:45.740 --> 02:56:50.420
<v Speaker 1>liquid panel where the her physician had</v>
<v Speaker 1>measured her ldl particle,</v>

3844
02:56:50.750 --> 02:56:52.970
<v Speaker 1>measuring particle size,</v>
<v Speaker 1>measured triglycerides,</v>

3845
02:56:52.971 --> 02:56:57.971
<v Speaker 1>all of these things wanting to get her </v>
<v Speaker 1>on stands because she had really high </v>

3846
02:56:57.971 --> 02:57:01.780
<v Speaker 1>cholesterol.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It turns out I knew why she had high </v>

3847
02:57:01.780 --> 02:57:01.850
<v Speaker 1>cholesterol.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She has high cholesterol because she has</v>

3848
02:57:01.851 --> 02:57:06.851
<v Speaker 1>gene polymorphism in April.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We for which prevents cholesterol from </v>

3849
02:57:06.851 --> 02:57:06.851
<v Speaker 1>being recycled,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's not.</v>

3850
02:57:06.890 --> 02:57:11.890
<v Speaker 1>That's why she has high cholesterol,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so she watched this video and she like </v>

3851
02:57:11.890 --> 02:57:14.681
<v Speaker 1>learned all about the particle size and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's the small dense ones that are </v>

3852
02:57:14.681 --> 02:57:16.370
<v Speaker 1>really an indicator of cardiovascular </v>
<v Speaker 1>disease and her small dense were like,</v>

3853
02:57:16.670 --> 02:57:21.670
<v Speaker 1>she had none.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was all the good kind of all the ldl </v>

3854
02:57:21.670 --> 02:57:22.940
<v Speaker 1>cholesterol is important because anytime</v>
<v Speaker 1>you make a new cell,</v>

3855
02:57:22.941 --> 02:57:23.750
<v Speaker 1>you need cholesterol.</v>

3856
02:57:23.780 --> 02:57:26.230
<v Speaker 1>Cholesterol is made of cell membranes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every time you're making a new kidney,</v>

3857
02:57:26.231 --> 02:57:27.470
<v Speaker 1>your liver cell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need cholesterol.</v>

3858
02:57:27.680 --> 02:57:32.680
<v Speaker 1>When you have damage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you hit yourself or you're doing </v>

3859
02:57:32.680 --> 02:57:32.980
<v Speaker 1>your workout and your muscles get a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little damaged,</v>

3860
02:57:32.981 --> 02:57:36.110
<v Speaker 1>you need cholesterol there to build,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to repair that damage so you need it.</v>

3861
02:57:36.830 --> 02:57:37.970
<v Speaker 1>If you don't have it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in trouble.</v>

3862
02:57:37.971 --> 02:57:42.971
<v Speaker 1>But anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the point is is that the saturated fat </v>

3863
02:57:42.971 --> 02:57:46.331
<v Speaker 1>can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why there's so much confusion is </v>

3864
02:57:46.331 --> 02:57:49.841
<v Speaker 1>because one gene polymorphisms to people</v>
<v Speaker 1>are now starting to tease apart that </v>

3865
02:57:50.331 --> 02:57:54.740
<v Speaker 1>it's actually the combination of eating </v>
<v Speaker 1>refined carbohydrates and saturated fat.</v>

3866
02:57:54.880 --> 02:57:59.880
<v Speaker 1>If you just have the saturated fat you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have and you're eating vegetables </v>

3867
02:57:59.880 --> 02:58:03.281
<v Speaker 1>and good things as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're not going to have all that </v>

3868
02:58:03.281 --> 02:58:03.281
<v Speaker 1>inflammation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to make small dense ldl</v>

3869
02:58:03.281 --> 02:58:07.941
<v Speaker 1>particles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I talked about this with you last </v>

3870
02:58:07.941 --> 02:58:09.591
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what makes the small dense ldls </v>

3871
02:58:09.591 --> 02:58:09.591
<v Speaker 1>inflammation.</v>

3872
02:58:09.591 --> 02:58:11.310
<v Speaker 1>So when you have the small dense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because a certain protein gets obscured,</v>

3873
02:58:11.730 --> 02:58:14.520
<v Speaker 1>it causes it to like stick to the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3874
02:58:14.580 --> 02:58:16.770
<v Speaker 1>to the walls of your blood vessels very </v>
<v Speaker 1>easy.</v>

3875
02:58:17.130 --> 02:58:22.130
<v Speaker 1>So that's kind of the danger because </v>
<v Speaker 1>then you start to accumulate a plaque </v>

3876
02:58:22.130 --> 02:58:25.101
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's totally makes sense when you </v>

3877
02:58:25.101 --> 02:58:27.801
<v Speaker 1>talk about the amount of heart disease </v>
<v Speaker 1>that exists in people that have this </v>

3878
02:58:27.801 --> 02:58:29.280
<v Speaker 1>typical American diet which is high in </v>
<v Speaker 1>saturated fat,</v>

3879
02:58:29.281 --> 02:58:31.900
<v Speaker 1>but also high in high fructose corn </v>
<v Speaker 1>syrup process.</v>

3880
02:58:31.901 --> 02:58:33.650
<v Speaker 1>Sugars in vegetables.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3881
02:58:34.070 --> 02:58:34.830
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the thing.</v>

3882
02:58:35.160 --> 02:58:36.720
<v Speaker 1>This is the problem with all those </v>
<v Speaker 1>studies,</v>

3883
02:58:37.110 --> 02:58:42.110
<v Speaker 1>those studies that are correlations is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're looking at people that are </v>

3884
02:58:42.151 --> 02:58:43.500
<v Speaker 1>eating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

3885
02:58:43.501 --> 02:58:44.940
<v Speaker 1>they're eating meat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

3886
02:58:44.941 --> 02:58:48.540
<v Speaker 1>they're eating saturated fat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're also not eating vegetables.</v>

3887
02:58:48.630 --> 02:58:53.630
<v Speaker 1>They're also eating cake and crackers </v>
<v Speaker 1>and chips and hamburger bonds and you </v>

3888
02:58:53.630 --> 02:58:55.560
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all that stuff and her lifestyle,</v>

3889
02:58:55.590 --> 02:58:57.240
<v Speaker 1>sedentary lifestyle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all those things.</v>

3890
02:58:57.240 --> 02:59:02.240
<v Speaker 1>So you know that these studies like you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to really take it with a grain of </v>

3891
02:59:03.211 --> 02:59:06.030
<v Speaker 1>salt and especially for healthy </v>
<v Speaker 1>omnivores,</v>

3892
02:59:06.060 --> 02:59:06.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>

3893
02:59:06.661 --> 02:59:08.100
<v Speaker 1>there are vegetarians that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>unhealthy.</v>

3894
02:59:08.101 --> 02:59:13.101
<v Speaker 1>They eat a bunch of process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's also very healthy vegetarians </v>

3895
02:59:13.101 --> 02:59:13.101
<v Speaker 1>and vegans out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3896
02:59:13.101 --> 02:59:16.700
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of unhealthy omnivores.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you were to go to like the DMV</v>

3897
02:59:16.701 --> 02:59:19.350
<v Speaker 1>where like someplace to everyone has to </v>
<v Speaker 1>go and like take a survey.</v>

3898
02:59:19.830 --> 02:59:22.740
<v Speaker 1>How many of them eat me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Will it probably like 95 percent of them</v>

3899
02:59:22.741 --> 02:59:25.830
<v Speaker 1>are going to eat meat and then you ask </v>
<v Speaker 1>them like what's their vegetable intake?</v>

3900
02:59:26.070 --> 02:59:27.810
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's your refining?</v>

3901
02:59:27.840 --> 02:59:30.210
<v Speaker 1>How many refined carbohydrates do you </v>
<v Speaker 1>take in how many,</v>

3902
02:59:30.380 --> 02:59:35.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're all going to be not eating </v>

3903
02:59:35.380 --> 02:59:37.281
<v Speaker 1>vegetables and they're going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>eating their cake and chips and you </v>

3904
02:59:37.281 --> 02:59:37.290
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's their,</v>

3905
02:59:37.320 --> 02:59:42.320
<v Speaker 1>their hot dog buns and sort of blame it </v>
<v Speaker 1>all on these.</v>

3906
02:59:43.170 --> 02:59:46.140
<v Speaker 1>The blame it all on saturated fats is </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>

3907
02:59:46.440 --> 02:59:47.490
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3908
02:59:47.610 --> 02:59:52.610
<v Speaker 1>some people can have a problem with </v>
<v Speaker 1>saturate when they have too high of a </v>

3909
02:59:52.610 --> 02:59:54.570
<v Speaker 1>saturated fat intake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if they're eating healthy.</v>

3910
02:59:54.780 --> 02:59:56.430
<v Speaker 1>Other healthy stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>

3911
02:59:56.431 --> 03:00:01.140
<v Speaker 1>because the gene that that's activated </v>
<v Speaker 1>that helps metabolize the fat,</v>

3912
03:00:01.141 --> 03:00:06.141
<v Speaker 1>break it up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>transports it to where it goes isn't </v>

3913
03:00:06.141 --> 03:00:06.141
<v Speaker 1>getting turned on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3914
03:00:06.141 --> 03:00:07.350
<v Speaker 1>we'll get those genes get turned on by </v>
<v Speaker 1>polyunsaturated fatty acids.</v>

3915
03:00:07.650 --> 03:00:10.860
<v Speaker 1>And so if you eat a ratio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're eating saturated fat,</v>

3916
03:00:10.890 --> 03:00:14.370
<v Speaker 1>which is dairy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know some pork,</v>

3917
03:00:15.220 --> 03:00:16.710
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>red meat mostly.</v>

3918
03:00:16.711 --> 03:00:21.711
<v Speaker 1>Like if you get a lean cut,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not even actually that high in </v>

3919
03:00:21.711 --> 03:00:23.580
<v Speaker 1>saturated fat compared to dairy or </v>
<v Speaker 1>cheese or butter.</v>

3920
03:00:23.690 --> 03:00:28.690
<v Speaker 1>So much misinformation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so many people spout out this </v>

3921
03:00:28.690 --> 03:00:28.690
<v Speaker 1>misinformation as fact too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just.</v>

3922
03:00:28.690 --> 03:00:30.960
<v Speaker 1>It's so frustrating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is frustrating.</v>

3923
03:00:30.961 --> 03:00:35.400
<v Speaker 1>The other thing is that people actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>will notice there's a problem in there.</v>

3924
03:00:36.030 --> 03:00:41.030
<v Speaker 1>If they're eating a lot of saturated fat</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they have one of these </v>

3925
03:00:41.030 --> 03:00:41.030
<v Speaker 1>polymorphisms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they start to gain weight.</v>

3926
03:00:41.030 --> 03:00:42.170
<v Speaker 1>They start to have bad lipid profile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They start to end.</v>

3927
03:00:42.171 --> 03:00:44.070
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they know like what I've been doing this</v>

3928
03:00:44.071 --> 03:00:45.660
<v Speaker 1>I measured,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know it's bad.</v>

3929
03:00:45.661 --> 03:00:48.240
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't realize it's possibly because</v>

3930
03:00:48.241 --> 03:00:49.830
<v Speaker 1>they have one of those gene </v>
<v Speaker 1>polymorphisms.</v>

3931
03:00:49.980 --> 03:00:54.980
<v Speaker 1>If they increase their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their poly unsaturated mono and </v>

3932
03:00:54.980 --> 03:00:54.980
<v Speaker 1>saturated fat may actually not be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem,</v>

3933
03:00:54.980 --> 03:00:58.680
<v Speaker 1>but in cholesterol in and of itself is </v>
<v Speaker 1>not a bad thing.</v>

3934
03:00:58.860 --> 03:01:02.740
<v Speaker 1>It's not no cholesterol.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need cholesterol.</v>

3935
03:01:03.160 --> 03:01:04.480
<v Speaker 1>You need it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need it.</v>

3936
03:01:04.481 --> 03:01:06.610
<v Speaker 1>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your own body's production of it,</v>

3937
03:01:06.880 --> 03:01:09.310
<v Speaker 1>but you also need to take some in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

3938
03:01:09.550 --> 03:01:10.300
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3939
03:01:10.420 --> 03:01:13.780
<v Speaker 1>taking in dietary cholesterol doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>even raise your body's cholesterol.</v>

3940
03:01:13.781 --> 03:01:16.150
<v Speaker 1>Saturated fat will raise your body's </v>
<v Speaker 1>cholesterol.</v>

3941
03:01:16.480 --> 03:01:18.370
<v Speaker 1>Dietary cholesterol from eggs doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>

3942
03:01:18.410 --> 03:01:20.370
<v Speaker 1>It's like nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't do anything wrong.</v>

3943
03:01:20.620 --> 03:01:24.770
<v Speaker 1>Michael Shermer bond crash showed that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so yeah.</v>

3944
03:01:24.771 --> 03:01:29.771
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was taking in dietary cholesterol </v>

3945
03:01:29.771 --> 03:01:29.771
<v Speaker 1>doesn't even like move the dial for </v>
<v Speaker 1>your.</v>

3946
03:01:29.771 --> 03:01:34.040
<v Speaker 1>Your body's cholesterol production.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so funny because so many people </v>

3947
03:01:34.040 --> 03:01:34.040
<v Speaker 1>think it does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what really moves it?</v>

3948
03:01:34.040 --> 03:01:38.140
<v Speaker 1>Stress stress dramatically increases </v>
<v Speaker 1>cholesterol production.</v>

3949
03:01:38.141 --> 03:01:41.080
<v Speaker 1>You know why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because when you're stressed,</v>

3950
03:01:41.081 --> 03:01:43.610
<v Speaker 1>your body makes your stress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your body starts to make cholesterol and</v>

3951
03:01:43.900 --> 03:01:48.750
<v Speaker 1>LDL lipoproteins which have cholesterol </v>
<v Speaker 1>in them because it stops up.</v>

3952
03:01:50.090 --> 03:01:55.090
<v Speaker 1>It stops up what's called endotoxin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is released when you're stressed </v>

3953
03:01:55.090 --> 03:01:58.951
<v Speaker 1>or inflamed and you want your.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to stop it up because it can </v>

3954
03:01:58.951 --> 03:02:01.921
<v Speaker 1>cause lots of damage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you start to make cholesterol and </v>

3955
03:02:01.921 --> 03:02:01.921
<v Speaker 1>what ends up happening is when you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>inflamed,</v>

3956
03:02:02.710 --> 03:02:07.710
<v Speaker 1>your body will turn off the production.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It basically starts making something </v>

3957
03:02:07.710 --> 03:02:10.510
<v Speaker 1>called [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is important to make these.</v>

3958
03:02:10.790 --> 03:02:15.790
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are very low dense particle ally </v>

3959
03:02:15.790 --> 03:02:18.780
<v Speaker 1>proteins I was talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what it also does is it inhibits </v>

3960
03:02:18.780 --> 03:02:23.760
<v Speaker 1>your body from being able to metabolize </v>
<v Speaker 1>fat with the exception of medium chain </v>

3961
03:02:23.760 --> 03:02:25.690
<v Speaker 1>triglycerides because it inhibits the </v>
<v Speaker 1>transporter.</v>

3962
03:02:25.840 --> 03:02:29.080
<v Speaker 1>This transporter on Mitochondria called </v>
<v Speaker 1>cpt.</v>

3963
03:02:29.560 --> 03:02:33.280
<v Speaker 1>That is inhibited when your body's </v>
<v Speaker 1>inflamed because it's making that Melano</v>

3964
03:02:33.280 --> 03:02:35.110
<v Speaker 1>Kobe and when that transporter is </v>
<v Speaker 1>inhibited,</v>

3965
03:02:35.680 --> 03:02:40.680
<v Speaker 1>your polyunsaturated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're saturated all like 99 percent of </v>

3966
03:02:40.680 --> 03:02:42.520
<v Speaker 1>the dietary fat you take in is not </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting used,</v>

3967
03:02:42.550 --> 03:02:46.000
<v Speaker 1>so it gets stored or it starts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you have fatty acids into your</v>

3968
03:02:46.001 --> 03:02:49.090
<v Speaker 1>bloodstream and can raise triglycerides </v>
<v Speaker 1>and things so it can be really bad,</v>

3969
03:02:49.360 --> 03:02:52.060
<v Speaker 1>but MCTs bypass that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mcts don't need that transporter.</v>

3970
03:02:52.780 --> 03:02:56.050
<v Speaker 1>We just blew through three hours again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's awesome.</v>

3971
03:02:56.140 --> 03:02:59.680
<v Speaker 1>Lou,</v>
<v Speaker 1>through it feels like it was 20 minutes.</v>

3972
03:02:59.950 --> 03:03:02.620
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really crazy.</v>

3973
03:03:02.790 --> 03:03:04.740
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These are ridiculous conversations.</v>

3974
03:03:05.070 --> 03:03:06.540
<v Speaker 3>Thank you very much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're awesome.</v>

3975
03:03:06.720 --> 03:03:07.530
<v Speaker 3>Thanks Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As always,</v>

3976
03:03:07.531 --> 03:03:11.130
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to have to go over this 50 </v>
<v Speaker 3>times with a notebook to try to get half</v>

3977
03:03:11.131 --> 03:03:13.890
<v Speaker 3>of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Found my fitness.com,</v>

3978
03:03:14.160 --> 03:03:16.770
<v Speaker 3>found my fitness on twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What else?</v>

3979
03:03:16.800 --> 03:03:17.910
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the genetic tool.</v>

3980
03:03:17.911 --> 03:03:20.970
<v Speaker 3>I've got people can check that out,</v>
