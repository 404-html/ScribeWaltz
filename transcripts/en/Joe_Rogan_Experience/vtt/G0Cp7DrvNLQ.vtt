1
00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:02.810
<v Speaker 1>It makes it look like we're on a radio </v>
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>

2
00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:07.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Joe Rogan experience</v>

3
00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:12.890
<v Speaker 2>Joe Rogan podcast by night.</v>

4
00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:18.800
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ladies and gentlemen,</v>

5
00:00:18.801 --> 00:00:20.150
<v Speaker 1>welcome back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Randall Carlson.</v>

6
00:00:20.151 --> 00:00:20.840
<v Speaker 1>How are you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sir?</v>

7
00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.830
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>

8
00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:27.040
<v Speaker 1>you freaked out the entire podcast </v>
<v Speaker 1>population the last time you were here </v>

9
00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.570
<v Speaker 1>with your stories of cataclysmic </v>
<v Speaker 1>disasters and,</v>

10
00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:31.010
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

11
00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.580
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

12
00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.890
<v Speaker 1>ramifications of asteroidal impacts and </v>
<v Speaker 1>just the,</v>

13
00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:41.020
<v Speaker 1>just the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the evidence that you presented was a </v>

14
00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:42.710
<v Speaker 1>real mindfuck as it were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

15
00:00:42.711 --> 00:00:44.660
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what can I say?</v>

16
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.790
<v Speaker 1>I apologize to all the listeners out </v>
<v Speaker 1>there that might have had nightmares.</v>

17
00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:54.880
<v Speaker 1>No worries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew that was going to be the case </v>

18
00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:54.880
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew after the first time I met you,</v>

19
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.050
<v Speaker 1>we had that long conversation in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Atlanta.</v>

20
00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.500
<v Speaker 1>I knew once you sat down for three hours</v>
<v Speaker 1>on a podcast and open up about that </v>

21
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:07.301
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was really going to uncork a lot of </v>

22
00:01:07.301 --> 00:01:07.301
<v Speaker 1>people's domes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

23
00:01:07.301 --> 00:01:11.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ironically there's an upside to the </v>

24
00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.370
<v Speaker 1>whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe we'll have time to get into that a</v>

25
00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:12.200
<v Speaker 1>little bit today.</v>

26
00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely.</v>

27
00:01:12.921 --> 00:01:17.921
<v Speaker 1>So tell me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just returned from a long excursion </v>

28
00:01:17.921 --> 00:01:21.371
<v Speaker 1>with Graham Hancock if you want to bend </v>
<v Speaker 1>that thing like that towards your face </v>

29
00:01:21.371 --> 00:01:21.371
<v Speaker 1>or probably work a little.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

30
00:01:21.371 --> 00:01:21.980
<v Speaker 1>there you go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

31
00:01:21.981 --> 00:01:26.981
<v Speaker 1>there you go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just returned from a long excursion </v>

32
00:01:26.981 --> 00:01:28.640
<v Speaker 1>with Graham Hancock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You guys were on the road.</v>

33
00:01:28.641 --> 00:01:32.630
<v Speaker 1>And what was the nature of your trip?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where we were.</v>

34
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.730
<v Speaker 1>I was taking Graham on a tour showing </v>
<v Speaker 1>them some landscapes.</v>

35
00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:39.110
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were,</v>

36
00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:44.290
<v Speaker 1>I could haul them to the landscapes of </v>
<v Speaker 1>catastrophe because he's doing his </v>

37
00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:47.180
<v Speaker 1>secret two fingerprints of the gods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

38
00:01:47.181 --> 00:01:52.181
<v Speaker 1>when he came out with that book in 1995,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was theorizing that there had been </v>

39
00:01:52.181 --> 00:01:55.790
<v Speaker 1>this lost civilization in prehistoric </v>
<v Speaker 1>times and you know,</v>

40
00:01:55.791 --> 00:02:00.791
<v Speaker 1>the critics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the gist of most of what the critics </v>

41
00:02:00.791 --> 00:02:04.331
<v Speaker 1>were attacking him on and there were </v>
<v Speaker 1>considerable attacks on him as a result </v>

42
00:02:04.341 --> 00:02:06.950
<v Speaker 1>of some of the things he put forward in </v>
<v Speaker 1>that book was that,</v>

43
00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:12.730
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there was this great civilization </v>

44
00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.730
<v Speaker 1>that had existed in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

45
00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.060
<v Speaker 1>somewhere back in prehistory.</v>

46
00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.650
<v Speaker 1>Where's the evidence of it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where,</v>

47
00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.110
<v Speaker 1>where is the worst of pottery?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

48
00:02:18.111 --> 00:02:23.111
<v Speaker 1>where are the carvings were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where is the infrastructure that would </v>

49
00:02:23.111 --> 00:02:27.481
<v Speaker 1>have existed and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if he really had an answer </v>

50
00:02:27.481 --> 00:02:32.321
<v Speaker 1>for that other than the fact that there </v>
<v Speaker 1>had been a cataclysmic events that had </v>

51
00:02:32.321 --> 00:02:36.731
<v Speaker 1>intervened between then and now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he wasn't really specific about what</v>

52
00:02:36.981 --> 00:02:39.710
<v Speaker 1>the nature of those catastrophes </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually,</v>

53
00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:44.770
<v Speaker 1>we're in a lot of additional research </v>
<v Speaker 1>has come out since 1995.</v>

54
00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:50.200
<v Speaker 1>That basically opens the window onto </v>
<v Speaker 1>those events that basically separates </v>

55
00:02:51.561 --> 00:02:53.330
<v Speaker 1>our modern history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

56
00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the recorded history goes back five or </v>

57
00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.930
<v Speaker 1>6,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

58
00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:00.080
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we look at</v>

59
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.240
<v Speaker 3>the emergence of modern civilization,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we would basically trace it back to nine</v>

60
00:03:04.241 --> 00:03:06.550
<v Speaker 3>or 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago with the emergence of,</v>

61
00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:08.610
<v Speaker 3>of um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

62
00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:10.450
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>agriculture,</v>

63
00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:15.010
<v Speaker 3>a dispersion of languages,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the first cities and so forth.</v>

64
00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:18.040
<v Speaker 3>When we go beyond that a few thousand </v>
<v Speaker 3>years,</v>

65
00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:21.550
<v Speaker 3>we're in a completely different world </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I mean,</v>

66
00:03:21.551 --> 00:03:25.840
<v Speaker 3>so completely different that it's almost</v>
<v Speaker 3>unrecognizable from our modern world.</v>

67
00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.270
<v Speaker 3>If we started recreating maps,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a going backwards,</v>

68
00:03:31.271 --> 00:03:34.690
<v Speaker 3>like taking snapshots of the planet </v>
<v Speaker 3>every millennium,</v>

69
00:03:34.691 --> 00:03:39.691
<v Speaker 3>going back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what we would see is that going back to </v>

70
00:03:39.691 --> 00:03:42.631
<v Speaker 3>seven or 8,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago with the basic configuration </v>

71
00:03:42.631 --> 00:03:44.500
<v Speaker 3>of our planet would not change much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Once we get 11,</v>

72
00:03:44.501 --> 00:03:45.760
<v Speaker 3>12,</v>
<v Speaker 3>13,000</v>

73
00:03:45.761 --> 00:03:50.761
<v Speaker 3>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the change has become profoundly </v>

74
00:03:50.761 --> 00:03:53.401
<v Speaker 3>dramatic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We start seeing sea levels going down </v>

75
00:03:53.401 --> 00:03:55.720
<v Speaker 3>hundreds of feet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We see massive ice sheets covering North</v>

76
00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.770
<v Speaker 3>America and Europe and and lots of other</v>
<v Speaker 3>enormous changes.</v>

77
00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:05.400
<v Speaker 3>Beyond that is what I considered to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>deep history because as we may have </v>

78
00:04:05.651 --> 00:04:07.930
<v Speaker 3>talked about in our last interview,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

79
00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:12.490
<v Speaker 3>we modern humans have been on this </v>
<v Speaker 3>planet for a 150 to 200,000</v>

80
00:04:12.491 --> 00:04:12.970
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>

81
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.940
<v Speaker 3>At least.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

82
00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:20.040
<v Speaker 3>if we go back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>say I think the oldest modern human </v>

83
00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.180
<v Speaker 3>skeleton ever found was named Homo adult</v>
<v Speaker 3>too,</v>

84
00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:28.380
<v Speaker 3>and he dates to about 180,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years roughly if we think of a </v>

85
00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:31.870
<v Speaker 3>generation of humans is 25 years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's 7,000</v>

86
00:04:31.871 --> 00:04:36.871
<v Speaker 3>generations of humans now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the question is,</v>

87
00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:42.900
<v Speaker 3>what were we doing for all those </v>
<v Speaker 3>thousands of generations until somebody </v>

88
00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:44.500
<v Speaker 3>finally realized,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

89
00:04:44.501 --> 00:04:46.600
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can plant crops,</v>

90
00:04:46.601 --> 00:04:48.070
<v Speaker 3>we can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

91
00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.860
<v Speaker 3>we can build cities,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can form communities,</v>

92
00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:53.350
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can invent language,</v>

93
00:04:53.351 --> 00:04:54.140
<v Speaker 3>etc.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Etc.</v>

94
00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:57.760
<v Speaker 3>WEll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my contention is,</v>

95
00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:02.940
<v Speaker 3>and I think the evidence that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>accumulating supports this </v>

96
00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:04.420
<v Speaker 3>interpretation at what we're really </v>
<v Speaker 3>seeing seven,</v>

97
00:05:04.421 --> 00:05:05.260
<v Speaker 3>eight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>9,000</v>

98
00:05:05.261 --> 00:05:08.410
<v Speaker 3>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is not the origins of civilization,</v>

99
00:05:08.411 --> 00:05:11.440
<v Speaker 3>but the rebooting of civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You see what I'm saying?</v>

100
00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:16.950
<v Speaker 3>And when we go back and we realize that </v>
<v Speaker 3>modern history is separated from deep </v>

101
00:05:18.461 --> 00:05:23.461
<v Speaker 3>history by this extraordinary series of </v>
<v Speaker 3>events that transpired between about 11 </v>

102
00:05:24.491 --> 00:05:26.680
<v Speaker 3>and 13 or 14,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago.</v>

103
00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:32.310
<v Speaker 3>Once We begin to recognize how extreme </v>
<v Speaker 3>these these events were in remodeling </v>

104
00:05:33.671 --> 00:05:35.830
<v Speaker 3>our planet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>totally remodeling our planet,</v>

105
00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:41.250
<v Speaker 3>it then becomes obvious to us why there </v>
<v Speaker 3>is not a lot of hard evidence for </v>

106
00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:45.490
<v Speaker 3>whatever went on prior to these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to these events.</v>

107
00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:50.870
<v Speaker 3>And there's been some things that they </v>
<v Speaker 3>found since then that have really sort </v>

108
00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:54.421
<v Speaker 3>of made graham hancock's theories become</v>
<v Speaker 3>more and more palatable to even </v>

109
00:05:54.551 --> 00:05:58.040
<v Speaker 3>mainstream scientists like go tap.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly,</v>

110
00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:01.490
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go back a good ang pedang.</v>

111
00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:06.860
<v Speaker 3>These are apparently a structures that </v>
<v Speaker 3>were buIlt at least 11 or 12,000</v>

112
00:06:06.861 --> 00:06:10.400
<v Speaker 3>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm waiting to find out the,</v>

113
00:06:10.401 --> 00:06:13.280
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the most recent ideas on him.</v>

114
00:06:13.281 --> 00:06:18.281
<v Speaker 3>I think that probably they go back much </v>
<v Speaker 3>older than that because from what graham</v>

115
00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:23.500
<v Speaker 3>told me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're just only in the preliminary </v>

116
00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:25.511
<v Speaker 3>stages of being excavated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I believe rebecca tempe is less than </v>

117
00:06:25.511 --> 00:06:25.820
<v Speaker 3>10 percent excavated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

118
00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:26.470
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

119
00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:31.480
<v Speaker 3>So this is this enormous ruined that </v>
<v Speaker 3>appears to be late pleistocene ice age </v>

120
00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:37.640
<v Speaker 3>in an age that apparently was </v>
<v Speaker 3>deliberately buried.</v>

121
00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:39.770
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is interesting.</v>

122
00:06:39.771 --> 00:06:44.771
<v Speaker 3>Brings up a very interesting issue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why would they deliberately buried and </v>

123
00:06:44.771 --> 00:06:49.211
<v Speaker 3>they noticed delivery deliberately </v>
<v Speaker 3>buried because of the uniformity of the </v>

124
00:06:49.211 --> 00:06:50.480
<v Speaker 3>age of the dirt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that when I questioned him on that,</v>

125
00:06:50.481 --> 00:06:55.481
<v Speaker 3>because I wanted to know if it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>because the first thing I thought to </v>

126
00:06:55.481 --> 00:06:58.451
<v Speaker 3>myself was it could be natural because I</v>
<v Speaker 3>have seen so many sedimentary deposits </v>

127
00:06:59.031 --> 00:07:03.410
<v Speaker 3>caused by great floods.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Graham assured me that that was,</v>

128
00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:07.040
<v Speaker 3>that it was human.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was deliberate.</v>

129
00:07:07.041 --> 00:07:09.960
<v Speaker 3>It was not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because if it had been buried by floods,</v>

130
00:07:09.961 --> 00:07:12.200
<v Speaker 3>your water,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there should be internal stratification.</v>

131
00:07:12.201 --> 00:07:16.650
<v Speaker 3>That would be very obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been giving it some thought and,</v>

132
00:07:16.651 --> 00:07:18.640
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what occurred to me was this and,</v>

133
00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:23.770
<v Speaker 3>and I ran this by grand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I haven't gotten a response from </v>

134
00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:28.721
<v Speaker 3>them on this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I started thinking if it was </v>

135
00:07:28.721 --> 00:07:28.721
<v Speaker 3>deliberately buried,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why would they bury it?</v>

136
00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:34.250
<v Speaker 3>Then I began thinking what we talked </v>
<v Speaker 3>about last time when we were talking </v>

137
00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:37.241
<v Speaker 3>about the tin guscott vanity in siberia </v>
<v Speaker 3>when you had this massive aerial </v>

138
00:07:37.241 --> 00:07:37.700
<v Speaker 3>detonation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

139
00:07:37.701 --> 00:07:40.460
<v Speaker 3>that was about a 15 megaton explosion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

140
00:07:40.461 --> 00:07:45.461
<v Speaker 3>Now that's equivalent to our biggest </v>
<v Speaker 3>hydrogen bombs that used to be in the </v>

141
00:07:45.461 --> 00:07:47.840
<v Speaker 3>american arsenal and it's just because </v>
<v Speaker 3>of an asteroid that,</v>

142
00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:52.370
<v Speaker 3>that blew up in our atmosphere,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but a 150 foot diameter asteroid,</v>

143
00:07:52.371 --> 00:07:55.790
<v Speaker 3>which is not that big really relative </v>
<v Speaker 3>into cosmic scale of things.</v>

144
00:07:56.850 --> 00:07:59.450
<v Speaker 3>The point though is that it was moving </v>
<v Speaker 3>really,</v>

145
00:07:59.451 --> 00:08:00.680
<v Speaker 3>really fast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

146
00:08:00.690 --> 00:08:02.000
<v Speaker 3>is moving,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

147
00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:07.300
<v Speaker 3>a rifle bullet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say on average it's about a </v>

148
00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:07.300
<v Speaker 3>thousand feet per second.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Write a,</v>

149
00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:11.920
<v Speaker 3>an asteroid coming into the atmosphere </v>
<v Speaker 3>is going to be 20 or 30 times that </v>

150
00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:15.590
<v Speaker 3>velocity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it carries an enormous kinetic punch.</v>

151
00:08:15.591 --> 00:08:20.591
<v Speaker 3>when it hits the atmosphere,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it explodes because of the fact that the</v>

152
00:08:21.351 --> 00:08:24.680
<v Speaker 3>earth is not actually absorbing a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 3>that energy.</v>

153
00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:27.050
<v Speaker 3>It's dispersed widely through the </v>
<v Speaker 3>atmosphere.</v>

154
00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:30.110
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>think about this particularly during the</v>

155
00:08:30.111 --> 00:08:35.111
<v Speaker 3>height of the cold war,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in order to protect our missile silos </v>

156
00:08:35.111 --> 00:08:37.160
<v Speaker 3>are super hard and command and control </v>
<v Speaker 3>centers.</v>

157
00:08:37.161 --> 00:08:39.530
<v Speaker 3>What did we do with them?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Put them on the ground,</v>

158
00:08:39.590 --> 00:08:40.850
<v Speaker 3>put them under ground.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We buried him.</v>

159
00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:43.040
<v Speaker 3>Exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that began.</v>

160
00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:48.160
<v Speaker 3>I began to think perhaps could could </v>
<v Speaker 3>explain why it was buried in order to </v>

161
00:08:48.261 --> 00:08:53.261
<v Speaker 3>preserve it against the possibility of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of some kind of an aerial burst or or </v>

162
00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:56.100
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some kind of a,</v>

163
00:08:56.120 --> 00:09:01.120
<v Speaker 1>a highly energetic event.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That seems a weird thing for 12,000</v>

164
00:09:01.171 --> 00:09:01.950
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

165
00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:02.520
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

166
00:09:02.521 --> 00:09:07.521
<v Speaker 1>What do we have really no evidence </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever that anybody's capable of </v>

167
00:09:07.521 --> 00:09:09.030
<v Speaker 1>doing anything like that that long ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was.</v>

168
00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:14.050
<v Speaker 1>I think on the contrary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that what we see at the very </v>

169
00:09:14.050 --> 00:09:16.890
<v Speaker 1>beginnings of recorded history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an obsession with the sky,</v>

170
00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:18.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's one of the points that graham</v>

171
00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:20.490
<v Speaker 1>brings out in his work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

172
00:09:20.491 --> 00:09:23.190
<v Speaker 1>is that that humans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our ancestors,</v>

173
00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:24.360
<v Speaker 1>have 10,</v>
<v Speaker 1>12,</v>

174
00:09:24.361 --> 00:09:27.840
<v Speaker 1>13,000,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or even much sooner than that ad had a,</v>

175
00:09:27.841 --> 00:09:32.841
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just an obsessive concern where the </v>

176
00:09:32.841 --> 00:09:33.630
<v Speaker 1>vents in the sky and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of these ancient structures,</v>

177
00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:38.810
<v Speaker 1>whether we're talking about stonehenge </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm sure it's going to be the same </v>

178
00:09:38.810 --> 00:09:38.810
<v Speaker 1>case with go beckley,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tappy,</v>

179
00:09:38.810 --> 00:09:40.080
<v Speaker 1>when we look at these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

180
00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:45.410
<v Speaker 1>this infrastructure from the messel </v>
<v Speaker 1>ethic period through the neolithic </v>

181
00:09:46.291 --> 00:09:48.150
<v Speaker 1>period from six,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five,</v>

182
00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:49.200
<v Speaker 1>4,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago,</v>

183
00:09:49.201 --> 00:09:50.250
<v Speaker 1>300 years ago.</v>

184
00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:53.610
<v Speaker 1>What we see is that there's this concern</v>
<v Speaker 1>with astronomy.</v>

185
00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:56.550
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see the astronomical alignments that</v>

186
00:09:56.551 --> 00:10:01.080
<v Speaker 1>are built into these structures actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>allow some pretty sophisticated,</v>

187
00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:02.740
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>observations of,</v>

188
00:10:02.830 --> 00:10:07.080
<v Speaker 1>of events happening in the sky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we can maybe pull up some stuff here</v>

189
00:10:07.081 --> 00:10:08.820
<v Speaker 1>that I've brought today to look at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

190
00:10:08.821 --> 00:10:09.990
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

191
00:10:09.991 --> 00:10:13.300
<v Speaker 1>I think that it's highly plausible that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people back then could have.</v>

192
00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:16.890
<v Speaker 1>Because think about this again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to try to put this in context.</v>

193
00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:21.540
<v Speaker 1>How many generations ago was the primary</v>
<v Speaker 1>mode of human transportation?</v>

194
00:10:21.541 --> 00:10:23.880
<v Speaker 1>Horseback,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not that many,</v>

195
00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:25.860
<v Speaker 1>four or five generations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and pretty crazy,</v>

196
00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:28.290
<v Speaker 1>pretty crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now think 7,000</v>

197
00:10:28.291 --> 00:10:30.270
<v Speaker 1>generations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you going to tell me then and all of</v>

198
00:10:30.271 --> 00:10:32.070
<v Speaker 1>that trance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of that time,</v>

199
00:10:32.071 --> 00:10:37.071
<v Speaker 1>all of those generations of humans that </v>
<v Speaker 1>have the same presumably intelligences </v>

200
00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:39.900
<v Speaker 1>our own because they've got the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>brain size,</v>

201
00:10:40.210 --> 00:10:45.210
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they're not going to be able to </v>

202
00:10:45.210 --> 00:10:45.210
<v Speaker 1>come up with some kind of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

203
00:10:45.210 --> 00:10:46.890
<v Speaker 1>a transmitted tradition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some type of,</v>

204
00:10:46.891 --> 00:10:47.620
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

205
00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:50.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea of somehow of culture,</v>

206
00:10:50.671 --> 00:10:52.860
<v Speaker 1>of civilization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of language,</v>

207
00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:53.730
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

208
00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:58.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's my point is that there was so </v>

209
00:10:58.820 --> 00:10:58.820
<v Speaker 1>much that has been lost.</v>

210
00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:02.370
<v Speaker 1>And once we understand how dynamic this </v>
<v Speaker 1>planet really is,</v>

211
00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:07.460
<v Speaker 1>it'll become clear to us why we don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>have the hard physical record of things </v>

212
00:11:08.191 --> 00:11:10.350
<v Speaker 1>going on 20 or 30,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>

213
00:11:10.410 --> 00:11:14.940
<v Speaker 1>To put it in perspective for people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>have never studied ancient Egypt.</v>

214
00:11:15.210 --> 00:11:18.840
<v Speaker 1>Cleopatra,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pyramids of you.</v>

215
00:11:18.841 --> 00:11:23.841
<v Speaker 1>If you look at the date of the pyramids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that cleopatra is closer to us.</v>

216
00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:27.120
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>than the pyramids were to clear path,</v>

217
00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:29.420
<v Speaker 1>which is nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

218
00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:31.590
<v Speaker 1>Stop and think about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

219
00:11:31.591 --> 00:11:34.200
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was that old back then?</v>

220
00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:39.500
<v Speaker 1>And they have found these little tiny </v>
<v Speaker 1>airplanes inside the pyramids,</v>

221
00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:41.140
<v Speaker 1>these little,</v>
<v Speaker 1>little,</v>

222
00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:42.750
<v Speaker 1>miniature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

223
00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:45.780
<v Speaker 1>carved airplanes that looked like </v>
<v Speaker 1>airplanes.</v>

224
00:11:45.781 --> 00:11:48.630
<v Speaker 1>If someone's people have tried to saY,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well no,</v>

225
00:11:48.631 --> 00:11:51.480
<v Speaker 1>they represent birds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't look like a burden at all.</v>

226
00:11:51.481 --> 00:11:54.850
<v Speaker 1>I mean they have a rudder and they look </v>
<v Speaker 1>like planes.</v>

227
00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:55.430
<v Speaker 1>Well yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

228
00:11:55.431 --> 00:11:56.590
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are tradItions,</v>

229
00:11:56.591 --> 00:12:00.340
<v Speaker 1>particularly the vedic traditions that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are full of descriptions of flying off.</v>

230
00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:02.080
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The vimanas yeah,</v>

231
00:12:02.081 --> 00:12:03.730
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what is that,</v>

232
00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:08.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to proclaim unequivocally </v>

233
00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:08.760
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

234
00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:12.870
<v Speaker 1>it's airplanes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at the same time we got to keep an </v>

235
00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:13.120
<v Speaker 1>open mind about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the point I'm trying to make is that</v>

236
00:12:13.121 --> 00:12:15.130
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was so much time to transpired.</v>

237
00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:19.300
<v Speaker 1>All kinds of things could have happened </v>
<v Speaker 1>that have basically been erased.</v>

238
00:12:19.390 --> 00:12:20.600
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

239
00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:24.580
<v Speaker 1>and hopefully by the end of today's </v>
<v Speaker 1>interview you'll have a better,</v>

240
00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:28.030
<v Speaker 1>clearer idea of specifically what some </v>
<v Speaker 1>of those things really were.</v>

241
00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:33.060
<v Speaker 1>So we're talking about a potential </v>
<v Speaker 1>civilization of maybe tens of thousands </v>

242
00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:35.200
<v Speaker 1>of years of growth and if we're looking </v>
<v Speaker 1>at what we're,</v>

243
00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:40.250
<v Speaker 1>what we have from the beginning of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dawn of civilization that we believed </v>

244
00:12:40.250 --> 00:12:43.900
<v Speaker 1>mesopotamia somewhere around 70,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago from that till today,</v>

245
00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:48.990
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about maybe double or </v>
<v Speaker 1>triple that was lost and these gigantic </v>

246
00:12:49.001 --> 00:12:51.670
<v Speaker 1>cataclysmic events may be 15,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20,000,</v>

247
00:12:51.671 --> 00:12:56.671
<v Speaker 1>30,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years of of human beings inventing </v>

248
00:12:56.671 --> 00:13:00.031
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people building upon the inventions of </v>

249
00:13:00.031 --> 00:13:02.260
<v Speaker 1>others expanding and then all of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>wiped out.</v>

250
00:13:02.770 --> 00:13:07.770
<v Speaker 1>We're rubbing sticks together again to </v>
<v Speaker 1>start fires and then whatever memories </v>

251
00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:12.900
<v Speaker 1>are left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people have to rebuild a generation or </v>

252
00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:12.900
<v Speaker 1>two ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was easy to dismiss.</v>

253
00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:17.170
<v Speaker 1>Ideas like that is fringe science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today as we sit here in 2015,</v>

254
00:13:17.171 --> 00:13:19.170
<v Speaker 1>it's not nearly so easy to dismiss that </v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

255
00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:24.180
<v Speaker 1>Particularly what we now know about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>history of this planet that are truly </v>

256
00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:27.211
<v Speaker 1>dynamic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is bad and that we have in effect </v>

257
00:13:27.211 --> 00:13:29.290
<v Speaker 1>been sort of blessed the last six to </v>
<v Speaker 1>10,000</v>

258
00:13:29.291 --> 00:13:31.570
<v Speaker 1>years were they relatively stable </v>
<v Speaker 1>climate.</v>

259
00:13:31.571 --> 00:13:35.470
<v Speaker 1>And I'm going to show you some graphs </v>
<v Speaker 1>here that really will blow your mind,</v>

260
00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:37.540
<v Speaker 1>that really will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will,</v>

261
00:13:37.541 --> 00:13:40.780
<v Speaker 1>will underscore how significant some of </v>
<v Speaker 1>these changes have been,</v>

262
00:13:40.781 --> 00:13:42.870
<v Speaker 1>how profound some of them have been.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And once we,</v>

263
00:13:42.910 --> 00:13:47.910
<v Speaker 1>once we know that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>begin to incorporate that into our </v>

264
00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:50.041
<v Speaker 1>thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we realize we're going to have to kind </v>

265
00:13:50.041 --> 00:13:50.110
<v Speaker 1>of reevaluate our models of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of prehistory.</v>

266
00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:52.090
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well we have a new setup now.</v>

267
00:13:52.091 --> 00:13:57.091
<v Speaker 1>So with the tricaster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're gonna allow randall to take </v>

268
00:13:57.091 --> 00:13:58.690
<v Speaker 1>control of the situation here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're just listening to this,</v>

269
00:13:58.750 --> 00:14:02.410
<v Speaker 1>this might be one of those podcasts </v>
<v Speaker 1>where if you're one of those people that</v>

270
00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:07.440
<v Speaker 1>listens to it on a commute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might want to go back and check out </v>

271
00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:07.440
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

272
00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:11.650
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>vimeo or youtube or those are the ones </v>

273
00:14:11.650 --> 00:14:11.980
<v Speaker 1>that use stream is going to give you a </v>
<v Speaker 1>hd now too,</v>

274
00:14:11.981 --> 00:14:13.070
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We do.</v>

275
00:14:13.390 --> 00:14:16.840
<v Speaker 1>Some people don't even know we do a hd </v>
<v Speaker 1>video of this podcast as well.</v>

276
00:14:16.841 --> 00:14:20.650
<v Speaker 1>So what is this oxygen isotopes in </v>
<v Speaker 1>greenland?</v>

277
00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:22.600
<v Speaker 1>oxygen isotopes in greenland.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

278
00:14:22.601 --> 00:14:27.601
<v Speaker 1>What we're looking at here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this goes back to the early nineties </v>

279
00:14:27.601 --> 00:14:30.631
<v Speaker 1>when glaciologists and paleo </v>
<v Speaker 1>climatologist guys should study ancient </v>

280
00:14:31.601 --> 00:14:35.110
<v Speaker 1>climate extracted these ice cores from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the summit of greenland,</v>

281
00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:40.140
<v Speaker 1>and the reason they went to the summit </v>
<v Speaker 1>was because they were looking for the </v>

282
00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:40.150
<v Speaker 1>most undistorted ice core records that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they could find.</v>

283
00:14:40.151 --> 00:14:43.840
<v Speaker 1>previous ice core extractions had been </v>
<v Speaker 1>near the perimeter of the,</v>

284
00:14:43.841 --> 00:14:48.841
<v Speaker 1>of the ice sheets in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ice flow is much more dynamic,</v>

285
00:14:48.971 --> 00:14:51.770
<v Speaker 1>so there was more distortion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your record.</v>

286
00:14:51.771 --> 00:14:52.040
<v Speaker 1>So what</v>

287
00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:53.560
<v Speaker 3>they did was they went to the very </v>
<v Speaker 3>center of.</v>

288
00:14:53.561 --> 00:14:55.490
<v Speaker 3>There was a european team and an </v>
<v Speaker 3>american team,</v>

289
00:14:56.090 --> 00:14:58.100
<v Speaker 3>and without getting into the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>into the background,</v>

290
00:14:58.101 --> 00:15:00.740
<v Speaker 3>basically the ice sheet there was almost</v>
<v Speaker 3>two miles thick.</v>

291
00:15:00.741 --> 00:15:03.440
<v Speaker 3>It took them five years to drill </v>
<v Speaker 3>through.</v>

292
00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:05.720
<v Speaker 3>It was miles thick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

293
00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:10.700
<v Speaker 3>Yet just think about how far like </v>
<v Speaker 3>looking how far two miles away.</v>

294
00:15:10.701 --> 00:15:11.590
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is a plane?</v>

295
00:15:11.591 --> 00:15:13.000
<v Speaker 3>A plane is a mile in the air.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

296
00:15:13.010 --> 00:15:13.630
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

297
00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:15.260
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is going to be about 30,000</v>

298
00:15:15.261 --> 00:15:16.430
<v Speaker 3>feet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's the mile?</v>

299
00:15:16.431 --> 00:15:18.180
<v Speaker 3>Thirty 5,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>feet a mile.</v>

300
00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:19.370
<v Speaker 3>Now human gut.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Remember this,</v>

301
00:15:19.371 --> 00:15:24.371
<v Speaker 3>because it's going to be at number 5,280</v>
<v Speaker 3>feet is a mile is a mile right now the </v>

302
00:15:25.011 --> 00:15:28.730
<v Speaker 3>tallest building in downtown la is </v>
<v Speaker 3>probably not over 800 feet.</v>

303
00:15:28.750 --> 00:15:30.740
<v Speaker 3>Three hundred feet at the most.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

304
00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:35.840
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure I did look it up at one </v>

305
00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:35.840
<v Speaker 3>point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What the tallest building was.</v>

306
00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:35.840
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what it was.</v>

307
00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:39.380
<v Speaker 3>I know the tallest building in atlanta </v>
<v Speaker 3>is a thousand and 60 feet and um,</v>

308
00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:40.800
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two miles,</v>

309
00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:45.820
<v Speaker 3>you'd have to think of 10 of those </v>
<v Speaker 3>stacked on top of each other to get a </v>

310
00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:45.820
<v Speaker 3>two mile thick sheet of ice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

311
00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:49.280
<v Speaker 3>that's an amazingly huge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>massive ice.</v>

312
00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:50.450
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

313
00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:55.800
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's pretty much the summit of </v>

314
00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:55.800
<v Speaker 3>greenland.</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

315
00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:56.930
<v Speaker 3>And what we're looking at on this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on this graph here,</v>

316
00:15:56.960 --> 00:16:01.960
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you go down the left side of the </v>

317
00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:02.570
<v Speaker 3>graph,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the surface.</v>

318
00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:05.600
<v Speaker 3>And then down here there's 1500.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You see right at the bottom,</v>

319
00:16:05.601 --> 00:16:07.580
<v Speaker 3>that's 1500 meters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

320
00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:12.940
<v Speaker 3>Fifteen hundred meters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You figure there's about three point </v>

321
00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:12.940
<v Speaker 3>two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>eight feet per meter.</v>

322
00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:15.920
<v Speaker 3>So that's going to be 45.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's gonna be close to 5,000.</v>

323
00:16:15.921 --> 00:16:18.470
<v Speaker 3>So this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is 1500 meters.</v>

324
00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:19.960
<v Speaker 3>Tufts aaliyah mile,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

325
00:16:20.010 --> 00:16:23.040
<v Speaker 3>a little less than a mile over here on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the right is,</v>

326
00:16:23.090 --> 00:16:26.450
<v Speaker 3>is the time in thousands of years before</v>
<v Speaker 3>the present.</v>

327
00:16:26.810 --> 00:16:29.510
<v Speaker 3>So you go down right there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a thousand years,</v>

328
00:16:29.511 --> 00:16:34.511
<v Speaker 3>you go down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's 2000 down at the bottom you see </v>

329
00:16:34.511 --> 00:16:34.511
<v Speaker 3>10.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's 10,000</v>

330
00:16:34.511 --> 00:16:38.111
<v Speaker 3>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now basically what the oxygen isotopes </v>

331
00:16:38.111 --> 00:16:41.561
<v Speaker 3>through there are a proxy for </v>
<v Speaker 3>temperature change adjacent to the ice </v>

332
00:16:41.561 --> 00:16:41.870
<v Speaker 3>mass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

333
00:16:42.330 --> 00:16:45.790
<v Speaker 3>And if you look at these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these are snapshots basically taken like</v>

334
00:16:45.850 --> 00:16:47.570
<v Speaker 3>every 10 years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

335
00:16:47.690 --> 00:16:52.690
<v Speaker 3>And once you see here is that the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is the temperature is oscillating back </v>

336
00:16:52.690 --> 00:16:53.360
<v Speaker 3>and forth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>back and forth.</v>

337
00:16:53.361 --> 00:16:58.361
<v Speaker 3>It's a two to four degrees centigrade.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now to put this into context,</v>

338
00:16:58.700 --> 00:16:59.590
<v Speaker 3>the concern,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

339
00:16:59.591 --> 00:17:04.591
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we got into this somewhat last time to </v>

340
00:17:04.591 --> 00:17:07.121
<v Speaker 3>hold issue of global warming and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I know that in some of the feedback </v>

341
00:17:07.121 --> 00:17:11.231
<v Speaker 3>we got some of the most critical </v>
<v Speaker 3>comments came from people who didn't </v>

342
00:17:11.231 --> 00:17:14.861
<v Speaker 3>like me undermining this whole concept </v>
<v Speaker 3>of global warming induced catastrophe,</v>

343
00:17:15.730 --> 00:17:20.730
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What we see here though is was clearly </v>

344
00:17:20.730 --> 00:17:20.750
<v Speaker 3>that the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the climate,</v>

345
00:17:20.751 --> 00:17:23.000
<v Speaker 3>this is the 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years that we're talking about here,</v>

346
00:17:23.001 --> 00:17:27.110
<v Speaker 3>it's called the holocene by geologists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's oscillating back and forth,</v>

347
00:17:27.150 --> 00:17:30.500
<v Speaker 3>two to four degrees centigrade every,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every 10,</v>

348
00:17:30.501 --> 00:17:31.610
<v Speaker 3>20,</v>
<v Speaker 3>30 years.</v>

349
00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:33.200
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we're,</v>

350
00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:38.470
<v Speaker 3>we're talking about a degree that has </v>
<v Speaker 3>changed basically in the last century to</v>

351
00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:40.340
<v Speaker 3>the century and a half,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

352
00:17:40.550 --> 00:17:45.550
<v Speaker 3>Which,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which really almost wouldn't even show </v>

353
00:17:45.550 --> 00:17:45.550
<v Speaker 3>up here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You see,</v>

354
00:17:45.550 --> 00:17:47.180
<v Speaker 3>but we're going down as we go down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll see if you go to the right.</v>

355
00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:50.100
<v Speaker 3>That means temperature's warming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you go to the left?</v>

356
00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:52.050
<v Speaker 1>It means it's cooling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

357
00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:54.870
<v Speaker 1>And so as we go back down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is through the holocene.</v>

358
00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:56.340
<v Speaker 1>We're going through here and if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

359
00:17:56.341 --> 00:17:59.040
<v Speaker 1>there's some interesting stuff going on </v>
<v Speaker 1>right here at about 8,000,</v>

360
00:17:59.041 --> 00:18:00.780
<v Speaker 1>200 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a really,</v>

361
00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:04.800
<v Speaker 1>there's a spike Of cooling right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was very,</v>

362
00:18:04.801 --> 00:18:08.520
<v Speaker 1>very significant cooling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that was probably a,</v>

363
00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:13.080
<v Speaker 1>caused the glaciers worldwide to start </v>
<v Speaker 1>growing again for short,</v>

364
00:18:13.081 --> 00:18:18.081
<v Speaker 1>for a couple of centuries after they had</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically disappeared at the end of the </v>

365
00:18:18.081 --> 00:18:22.130
<v Speaker 1>ice age.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this was a very significant event </v>

366
00:18:22.130 --> 00:18:25.730
<v Speaker 1>right here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then as we get down right here at </v>

367
00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:25.730
<v Speaker 1>10,000,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see it starts deviating to the left,</v>

368
00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:28.350
<v Speaker 1>it starts deviating to the cooler.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go to the next slide.</v>

369
00:18:28.351 --> 00:18:31.080
<v Speaker 1>Where do we take this graph and we turn </v>
<v Speaker 1>it on its side.</v>

370
00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:35.100
<v Speaker 1>And what I've done here is you see this </v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

371
00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:38.940
<v Speaker 1>this is the present right here and this </v>
<v Speaker 1>is basically 10,000</v>

372
00:18:38.941 --> 00:18:41.320
<v Speaker 1>years ago over here on the right side </v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

373
00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:42.510
<v Speaker 1>and I've drawn a level.</v>

374
00:18:42.540 --> 00:18:46.520
<v Speaker 1>There's a level green line in here to </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of give you a comparison and you'll</v>

375
00:18:46.530 --> 00:18:48.240
<v Speaker 1>notice something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's this 8,000,</v>

376
00:18:48.241 --> 00:18:51.120
<v Speaker 1>200 year ago cold spike,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

377
00:18:51.390 --> 00:18:55.230
<v Speaker 1>And then as we're going along here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll notice something that the general</v>

378
00:18:55.231 --> 00:19:00.231
<v Speaker 1>amplitude of these oscillations starts </v>
<v Speaker 1>increasing as we get closer to the </v>

379
00:19:00.231 --> 00:19:00.240
<v Speaker 1>present.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you see that?</v>

380
00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:01.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it gets better.</v>

381
00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:04.140
<v Speaker 1>And you'll also notice that it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>dropping,</v>

382
00:19:04.141 --> 00:19:07.680
<v Speaker 1>it's dropping below that green line and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that means it's cooling.</v>

383
00:19:08.130 --> 00:19:09.840
<v Speaker 1>So in the last 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>

384
00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:15.260
<v Speaker 1>we went from a period of considerable </v>
<v Speaker 1>warmth in the immediate post glacial </v>

385
00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:19.580
<v Speaker 1>era.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it began to cool off around </v>

386
00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:19.580
<v Speaker 1>6,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago,</v>

387
00:19:19.590 --> 00:19:20.700
<v Speaker 1>5,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago,</v>

388
00:19:20.701 --> 00:19:23.370
<v Speaker 1>and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>begin to cool off the temperature.</v>

389
00:19:23.371 --> 00:19:26.190
<v Speaker 1>Oscillations began to increase in </v>
<v Speaker 1>magnitude.</v>

390
00:19:26.490 --> 00:19:31.490
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which actually contradicts the computer </v>

391
00:19:31.490 --> 00:19:34.740
<v Speaker 1>models that are saying the amplitude of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the oscillations is going to increase as</v>

392
00:19:34.741 --> 00:19:35.730
<v Speaker 1>the climate gets warmer.</v>

393
00:19:35.730 --> 00:19:38.730
<v Speaker 1>What we actually see from the greenland </v>
<v Speaker 1>ice cores is the opposite of that.</v>

394
00:19:39.030 --> 00:19:43.350
<v Speaker 1>And it's right here in this graph.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what's really significant about this</v>

395
00:19:43.710 --> 00:19:47.970
<v Speaker 1>is when we go back beyond 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago,</v>

396
00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:51.090
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we see this jesus christ.</v>

397
00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:53.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For folks who listening,</v>

398
00:19:53.490 --> 00:19:56.400
<v Speaker 1>there's a giant change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

399
00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:58.830
<v Speaker 1>we're looking at a little tiny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

400
00:19:58.831 --> 00:20:00.420
<v Speaker 1>maybe millimeter left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

401
00:20:00.421 --> 00:20:00.870
<v Speaker 1>Left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

402
00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:03.240
<v Speaker 1>left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right up until this point.</v>

403
00:20:03.241 --> 00:20:07.080
<v Speaker 1>Now we're looking at huge changes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huge changes.</v>

404
00:20:07.530 --> 00:20:10.890
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Catastrophic changes of temperature.</v>

405
00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:11.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

406
00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.030
<v Speaker 1>and here we're going back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is notice,</v>

407
00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:18.090
<v Speaker 1>this is between a 11 right here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly 11,600</v>

408
00:20:18.091 --> 00:20:20.040
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And about 14,000</v>

409
00:20:20.041 --> 00:20:21.600
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at what happened right here.</v>

410
00:20:21.601 --> 00:20:25.320
<v Speaker 1>You can see right around 15,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago,</v>

411
00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:28.500
<v Speaker 1>the climate is is actually if we took </v>
<v Speaker 1>this thing out of here,</v>

412
00:20:28.501 --> 00:20:33.501
<v Speaker 1>you can see there's almost a a trend </v>
<v Speaker 1>upwards that gets interrupted right </v>

413
00:20:33.781 --> 00:20:34.980
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Boom,</v>

414
00:20:35.010 --> 00:20:36.180
<v Speaker 1>instantly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boom,</v>

415
00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:38.460
<v Speaker 1>overnight jump overnight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Overnight.</v>

416
00:20:38.461 --> 00:20:39.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in fact,</v>

417
00:20:40.410 --> 00:20:45.410
<v Speaker 1>what has happened is if you go back </v>
<v Speaker 1>through the literature of of climate </v>

418
00:20:45.410 --> 00:20:47.130
<v Speaker 1>change and you read the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the estimates,</v>

419
00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:48.010
<v Speaker 1>how long</v>

420
00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:53.010
<v Speaker 3>it took for the planet to shift modes </v>
<v Speaker 3>from full glacial to the interglacial </v>

421
00:20:53.010 --> 00:20:55.690
<v Speaker 3>like we're now 50,</v>
<v Speaker 3>75 years ago,</v>

422
00:20:56.110 --> 00:20:58.870
<v Speaker 3>it was a thousand or more years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thousands of years.</v>

423
00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:02.050
<v Speaker 3>When radiocarbon dating came along in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the fifties,</v>

424
00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:07.030
<v Speaker 3>it began to compress and what happened </v>
<v Speaker 3>is that if you look in the eighties,</v>

425
00:21:07.031 --> 00:21:12.031
<v Speaker 3>they're talking about perhaps a century,</v>
<v Speaker 3>several centuries now comes the </v>

426
00:21:12.031 --> 00:21:14.560
<v Speaker 3>greenland ice cores and other ice cores </v>
<v Speaker 3>and other proxies,</v>

427
00:21:14.561 --> 00:21:19.561
<v Speaker 3>deep sea corps and so forth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the correlation of all of this </v>

428
00:21:19.561 --> 00:21:21.210
<v Speaker 3>evidence and it goes from centuries,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two decades.</v>

429
00:21:22.210 --> 00:21:26.030
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as the ability to perceive these changes</v>

430
00:21:26.031 --> 00:21:30.280
<v Speaker 3>through with ever greater precision and </v>
<v Speaker 3>ever greater resolution has evolved.</v>

431
00:21:30.490 --> 00:21:35.490
<v Speaker 3>It's gotten to now where the change,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the climate change that took us from </v>

432
00:21:35.490 --> 00:21:39.541
<v Speaker 3>glacial interglacial happened in less </v>
<v Speaker 3>than five years and that's what we're </v>

433
00:21:39.541 --> 00:21:42.690
<v Speaker 3>seeing right here in this graph.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what we're seeing.</v>

434
00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:47.840
<v Speaker 3>So 2010 glacier,</v>
<v Speaker 3>2015 done ice age over the glacier.</v>

435
00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:54.300
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bear in mind now that there was a </v>

436
00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:55.120
<v Speaker 3>considerable lag between the actual,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

437
00:21:55.350 --> 00:22:00.350
<v Speaker 3>the manifestation of the glaciers </v>
<v Speaker 3>because the glaciers didn't melt that </v>

438
00:22:00.350 --> 00:22:03.070
<v Speaker 3>quick because they're so huge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Imagine it.</v>

439
00:22:03.071 --> 00:22:06.370
<v Speaker 3>We had a big chunk of ice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We had an ice sculpture here.</v>

440
00:22:06.371 --> 00:22:10.360
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if the temperature is 31 degrees,</v>

441
00:22:10.361 --> 00:22:15.361
<v Speaker 3>it's not going to melt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you turn the temperature up to 70 </v>

442
00:22:15.361 --> 00:22:15.361
<v Speaker 3>degrees,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

443
00:22:15.361 --> 00:22:20.310
<v Speaker 3>We could turn the temperature up in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>matter and he could warm up the room in </v>

444
00:22:20.310 --> 00:22:22.120
<v Speaker 3>a matter of hours or minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's gonna take a while for that ice</v>

445
00:22:22.121 --> 00:22:23.650
<v Speaker 3>sculpture to melt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's going to be a lag,</v>

446
00:22:23.690 --> 00:22:28.690
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Although the change that led to that </v>

447
00:22:28.690 --> 00:22:30.340
<v Speaker 3>meltdown was virtually instantaneous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You see so,</v>

448
00:22:30.610 --> 00:22:33.190
<v Speaker 3>but in that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in that period,</v>

449
00:22:33.191 --> 00:22:35.290
<v Speaker 3>and it's the interim,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what we're seeing right here,</v>

450
00:22:35.830 --> 00:22:39.970
<v Speaker 3>there was an extraordinary right here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think if I go to the next slide,</v>

451
00:22:39.971 --> 00:22:43.360
<v Speaker 3>I think you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's go to the next one.</v>

452
00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:46.150
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to zoom in here so you can see</v>

453
00:22:46.151 --> 00:22:49.840
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There were two massive warming spikes.</v>

454
00:22:50.290 --> 00:22:52.990
<v Speaker 3>One right here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can see that we're down here in full</v>

455
00:22:52.991 --> 00:22:55.720
<v Speaker 3>glacial mode right there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then boom,</v>

456
00:22:55.810 --> 00:22:57.430
<v Speaker 3>right there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's huge spike of,</v>

457
00:22:57.431 --> 00:23:02.431
<v Speaker 3>of warming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now what does that represent when it </v>

458
00:23:02.431 --> 00:23:02.431
<v Speaker 3>comes to like temperatures?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

459
00:23:02.431 --> 00:23:05.140
<v Speaker 3>that could be on the order of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

460
00:23:05.230 --> 00:23:07.840
<v Speaker 3>that would be about 10 to 12 degrees </v>
<v Speaker 3>centigrade,</v>

461
00:23:07.841 --> 00:23:10.270
<v Speaker 3>which would be about 18 degrees </v>
<v Speaker 3>fahrenheit.</v>

462
00:23:10.570 --> 00:23:13.300
<v Speaker 3>Average temperature,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a crazy,</v>

463
00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:18.360
<v Speaker 3>crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy change because they're scared of </v>

464
00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:18.360
<v Speaker 3>two degrees,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

465
00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:18.360
<v Speaker 3>Scared of two degrees.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And here we're looking,</v>

466
00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:20.050
<v Speaker 3>we're scared to tutorees centigrade </v>
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>

467
00:23:20.051 --> 00:23:25.051
<v Speaker 3>We're looking at five,</v>
<v Speaker 3>six times that much in a matter of a </v>

468
00:23:25.051 --> 00:23:28.030
<v Speaker 3>couple of years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'll see at this point,</v>

469
00:23:28.690 --> 00:23:30.580
<v Speaker 3>we don't really have an explanation for </v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

470
00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:33.580
<v Speaker 3>That's why I get really frustrated when </v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody says to me,</v>

471
00:23:33.581 --> 00:23:35.420
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the debate on climate change is over.</v>

472
00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:36.670
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

473
00:23:36.671 --> 00:23:37.060
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>

474
00:23:37.090 --> 00:23:37.510
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>

475
00:23:37.570 --> 00:23:40.600
<v Speaker 3>we're in the infancy of understanding </v>
<v Speaker 3>the climate of this planet.</v>

476
00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:43.630
<v Speaker 3>And when we look at stuff like this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you see,</v>

477
00:23:44.070 --> 00:23:46.640
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it really drives home that point.</v>

478
00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:48.650
<v Speaker 3>And you can see here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right here people,</v>

479
00:23:48.700 --> 00:23:53.700
<v Speaker 3>people are saying when they're saying </v>
<v Speaker 3>that the debate on climate change is </v>

480
00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:56.351
<v Speaker 3>over though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is whether or not human beings have had </v>

481
00:23:56.351 --> 00:23:56.840
<v Speaker 3>an impact on it in current times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No question.</v>

482
00:23:56.870 --> 00:24:00.080
<v Speaker 3>We have had an impact.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No question of what the debate is.</v>

483
00:24:00.081 --> 00:24:01.490
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

484
00:24:01.491 --> 00:24:05.660
<v Speaker 3>if you say that the debate is about have</v>
<v Speaker 3>humans had an impact or not,</v>

485
00:24:05.870 --> 00:24:07.520
<v Speaker 3>I think that there is no debate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

486
00:24:07.550 --> 00:24:12.550
<v Speaker 3>Humans have had an impact.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What they're looking at though in your </v>

487
00:24:12.550 --> 00:24:14.310
<v Speaker 3>mind is one aspect of a very </v>
<v Speaker 3>multidimensional issue.</v>

488
00:24:14.311 --> 00:24:15.410
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

489
00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:17.360
<v Speaker 3>exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

490
00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:18.580
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and my,</v>

491
00:24:18.650 --> 00:24:22.550
<v Speaker 3>my concern is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that we're going to get so focused on</v>

492
00:24:22.580 --> 00:24:27.580
<v Speaker 3>carbon chains and carbon chains that </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're not looking at any of these other </v>

493
00:24:27.580 --> 00:24:27.580
<v Speaker 3>factors.</v>

494
00:24:27.580 --> 00:24:32.140
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that what people do though?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We concentrate on one aspect of things </v>

495
00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:36.050
<v Speaker 3>and it becomes like almost like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>cultural meme and that it spreads.</v>

496
00:24:36.051 --> 00:24:39.470
<v Speaker 3>And this is all people talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It had been so many people.</v>

497
00:24:39.471 --> 00:24:44.471
<v Speaker 3>I guarantee you that we're upset at what</v>
<v Speaker 3>you said have not researched climate </v>

498
00:24:44.471 --> 00:24:48.911
<v Speaker 3>change at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just have parroted the words of </v>

499
00:24:48.911 --> 00:24:48.980
<v Speaker 3>people that they've heard on television </v>
<v Speaker 3>that are experts.</v>

500
00:24:49.010 --> 00:24:49.640
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got this.</v>

501
00:24:49.670 --> 00:24:52.010
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>97 percent agree.</v>

502
00:24:52.011 --> 00:24:54.080
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you look into the origin of that,</v>

503
00:24:54.890 --> 00:24:57.500
<v Speaker 3>it's pretty contrived.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It really is.</v>

504
00:24:57.530 --> 00:24:59.030
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how you come up with that and,</v>

505
00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:01.750
<v Speaker 3>and we could do an hour long discussion </v>
<v Speaker 3>on dan.</v>

506
00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:04.370
<v Speaker 3>I don't really think we want to get into</v>
<v Speaker 3>that today,</v>

507
00:25:04.940 --> 00:25:09.940
<v Speaker 3>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really feel like I should write an </v>

508
00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:12.251
<v Speaker 3>analysis of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The source of that 97 percent so called </v>

509
00:25:12.251 --> 00:25:13.490
<v Speaker 3>consensus so that people can really see </v>
<v Speaker 3>where it came from.</v>

510
00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:19.000
<v Speaker 3>In a nutshell.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Basically it goes to three or four </v>

511
00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:22.391
<v Speaker 3>pieces of research.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some surveys that went out that were </v>

512
00:25:22.391 --> 00:25:24.160
<v Speaker 3>slanted right from the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's such as a.</v>

513
00:25:24.230 --> 00:25:27.200
<v Speaker 3>Do you feel that humans have an impact </v>
<v Speaker 3>on climate?</v>

514
00:25:28.010 --> 00:25:30.020
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody disagrees with that.</v>

515
00:25:30.021 --> 00:25:34.550
<v Speaker 3>So you can go through all the whoever </v>
<v Speaker 3>these so-called deniers are.</v>

516
00:25:35.150 --> 00:25:36.290
<v Speaker 3>I have looked and looked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who's,</v>

517
00:25:36.350 --> 00:25:41.350
<v Speaker 3>who's denying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is there any climate scientists on any </v>

518
00:25:41.350 --> 00:25:45.940
<v Speaker 3>anywhere on the spectrum that denies </v>
<v Speaker 3>that the climate changes or that denies </v>

519
00:25:45.940 --> 00:25:50.051
<v Speaker 3>that humans have had an influence on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>climate and I haven't found a single </v>

520
00:25:50.051 --> 00:25:50.051
<v Speaker 3>one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So in other words,</v>

521
00:25:50.051 --> 00:25:51.730
<v Speaker 3>these deniers that you hear about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

522
00:25:51.860 --> 00:25:54.890
<v Speaker 3>the climate change deniers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't really exist.</v>

523
00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:57.950
<v Speaker 3>There are those who criticize the </v>
<v Speaker 3>consensus view,</v>

524
00:25:58.220 --> 00:26:00.260
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That the dominant mode of climate change</v>

525
00:26:00.261 --> 00:26:05.261
<v Speaker 3>is being induced by humans and they are </v>
<v Speaker 3>being shoved into this camp of climate </v>

526
00:26:05.261 --> 00:26:06.710
<v Speaker 3>change deniers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're not.</v>

527
00:26:07.010 --> 00:26:09.110
<v Speaker 3>They're absolutely not climate change </v>
<v Speaker 3>deniers.</v>

528
00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:11.570
<v Speaker 3>And when you look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff like this,</v>

529
00:26:11.690 --> 00:26:16.690
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of these guys who would question </v>

530
00:26:16.690 --> 00:26:18.611
<v Speaker 3>the so called anthropogenic climate </v>
<v Speaker 3>change consensus are guys who have done </v>

531
00:26:18.611 --> 00:26:19.850
<v Speaker 3>this work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now this work is how old?</v>

532
00:26:19.910 --> 00:26:20.500
<v Speaker 3>How?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

533
00:26:20.510 --> 00:26:21.770
<v Speaker 3>let's go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This goes to the.</v>

534
00:26:22.670 --> 00:26:24.820
<v Speaker 3>This goes back to the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to these are the,</v>

535
00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:27.650
<v Speaker 3>this work that I'm showing you here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was published in [inaudible] 93.</v>

536
00:26:28.070 --> 00:26:28.600
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

537
00:26:28.770 --> 00:26:29.540
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

538
00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:35.320
<v Speaker 3>the greenland ice sheet project and the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the greenland ice sheet project into </v>

539
00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:37.990
<v Speaker 3>greenland.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

540
00:26:37.991 --> 00:26:42.770
<v Speaker 3>I forget it was grip and just the two.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a european and an american team.</v>

541
00:26:42.771 --> 00:26:46.560
<v Speaker 3>They five years drilling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so these are the most accurate proxies.</v>

542
00:26:46.561 --> 00:26:51.420
<v Speaker 3>We have it in hand and they're pulling </v>
<v Speaker 3>tubes of ice is just like a cylinder.</v>

543
00:26:51.450 --> 00:26:56.450
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like cylinders picture maybe six inches </v>

544
00:26:56.450 --> 00:26:58.521
<v Speaker 3>in diameter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they have like a circular cutting </v>

545
00:26:58.521 --> 00:27:01.101
<v Speaker 3>thing and they have a circular cutting </v>
<v Speaker 3>drill that extracts these ice cores and </v>

546
00:27:01.101 --> 00:27:04.260
<v Speaker 3>for the last 20 years they've been </v>
<v Speaker 3>analyzing the ice core,</v>

547
00:27:04.261 --> 00:27:09.261
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it took five years to get them out and </v>

548
00:27:09.261 --> 00:27:10.440
<v Speaker 3>it's been 20 years now of analyzing what</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're telling us.</v>

549
00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:15.500
<v Speaker 3>So before they had all these ice cores,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they were saying that this climate </v>

550
00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:16.920
<v Speaker 3>change took thousands of years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was that just guessing?</v>

551
00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:22.280
<v Speaker 3>Pretty much based.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was based upon actual empirical </v>

552
00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:26.960
<v Speaker 3>observations of ice glaciers receding as</v>
<v Speaker 3>a result of the modern warming because </v>

553
00:27:30.001 --> 00:27:33.870
<v Speaker 3>you have to understand up until about </v>
<v Speaker 3>the middle of the 19th century,</v>

554
00:27:33.871 --> 00:27:38.871
<v Speaker 3>we were in the middle of what was has </v>
<v Speaker 3>commonly been referred to as the little </v>

555
00:27:38.871 --> 00:27:39.490
<v Speaker 3>ice age.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

556
00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:42.420
<v Speaker 3>and this is another thing that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>important to put into context.</v>

557
00:27:43.110 --> 00:27:46.230
<v Speaker 3>The ice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The little ice age was in two phases.</v>

558
00:27:46.260 --> 00:27:49.920
<v Speaker 3>the earliest phase came on in about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>mid 13 hundreds,</v>

559
00:27:50.300 --> 00:27:53.130
<v Speaker 3>then it warmed for about a century into </v>
<v Speaker 3>15,</v>

560
00:27:53.190 --> 00:27:55.650
<v Speaker 3>16 hundreds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then the second phase came on.</v>

561
00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:59.310
<v Speaker 3>During that time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the glaciers worldwide began to grow,</v>

562
00:27:59.670 --> 00:28:03.360
<v Speaker 3>and most of the evidence today suggests </v>
<v Speaker 3>that during the little ice age,</v>

563
00:28:03.390 --> 00:28:06.840
<v Speaker 3>glaciers were bigger than they had been </v>
<v Speaker 3>in 10,000</v>

564
00:28:06.841 --> 00:28:07.350
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>

565
00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:10.530
<v Speaker 3>So around the middle of the 19th </v>
<v Speaker 3>century,</v>

566
00:28:10.531 --> 00:28:12.330
<v Speaker 3>around 1850,</v>
<v Speaker 3>give or take,</v>

567
00:28:12.331 --> 00:28:17.331
<v Speaker 3>a decade or two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the climate began to warm out of the </v>

568
00:28:17.331 --> 00:28:18.600
<v Speaker 3>little ice age and glaciers began to </v>
<v Speaker 3>receive.</v>

569
00:28:19.050 --> 00:28:24.050
<v Speaker 3>Right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we look at glacier recession that's </v>

570
00:28:24.050 --> 00:28:27.021
<v Speaker 3>going on right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's been going on for the last 10 </v>

571
00:28:27.021 --> 00:28:29.601
<v Speaker 3>or 20 years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what we see is it's basically a </v>

572
00:28:29.601 --> 00:28:32.391
<v Speaker 3>continuation of the recession.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's been going on for 160 or 170 years.</v>

573
00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:39.140
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's important to establish what's </v>

574
00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:41.370
<v Speaker 3>our baseline when we're comparing modern</v>
<v Speaker 3>recession of glaciers.</v>

575
00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:46.760
<v Speaker 3>Bear in mind that our baseline is we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>starting from the glaciers being bigger </v>

576
00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:48.600
<v Speaker 3>than they had been in 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>

577
00:28:48.870 --> 00:28:51.350
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the.</v>

578
00:28:51.530 --> 00:28:56.530
<v Speaker 3>I think then we have to understand that </v>
<v Speaker 3>that that little ice agent in fact had </v>

579
00:28:56.530 --> 00:28:58.140
<v Speaker 3>some pretty serious consequences for </v>
<v Speaker 3>civilization.</v>

580
00:28:59.250 --> 00:29:02.370
<v Speaker 3>We can see that there were two period in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the last 2000 years.</v>

581
00:29:02.370 --> 00:29:05.460
<v Speaker 3>There were two periods of of global </v>
<v Speaker 3>cooling.</v>

582
00:29:05.820 --> 00:29:07.980
<v Speaker 3>One of them occurred in the sixth </v>
<v Speaker 3>century.</v>

583
00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:12.990
<v Speaker 3>It actually now can be accurately dated </v>
<v Speaker 3>to occurring between 5:36</v>

584
00:29:12.991 --> 00:29:14.940
<v Speaker 3>and 5:44</v>
<v Speaker 3>a d,</v>

585
00:29:16.050 --> 00:29:21.050
<v Speaker 3>which is a very interesting time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This was basically the time that </v>

586
00:29:21.050 --> 00:29:24.321
<v Speaker 3>historians have have for for decades </v>
<v Speaker 3>said this was the onset of the dark </v>

587
00:29:24.321 --> 00:29:29.151
<v Speaker 3>ages.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's also the time during which all of </v>

588
00:29:29.151 --> 00:29:31.560
<v Speaker 3>the arthurian myths and the grail quest </v>
<v Speaker 3>stories are placed.</v>

589
00:29:31.860 --> 00:29:34.980
<v Speaker 3>You know arthur arthur,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his desk death is,</v>

590
00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:38.850
<v Speaker 3>is traditionally placed at the battle of</v>
<v Speaker 3>cam land or cam lawn,</v>

591
00:29:39.180 --> 00:29:42.550
<v Speaker 3>which is usually dated at about five a </v>
<v Speaker 3>which,</v>

592
00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:45.910
<v Speaker 3>which basically culminated this quest </v>
<v Speaker 3>for the grail.</v>

593
00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:48.730
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>WhAt was the other grail?</v>

594
00:29:48.731 --> 00:29:53.731
<v Speaker 3>Stories themselves were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>were set down in writing between about </v>

595
00:29:53.731 --> 00:29:58.321
<v Speaker 3>1130 and 1230 d in this really </v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting time during the middle ages.</v>

596
00:29:58.811 --> 00:30:02.290
<v Speaker 3>At the same time that the great </v>
<v Speaker 3>cathedrals were being built.</v>

597
00:30:03.580 --> 00:30:08.580
<v Speaker 3>When the cath,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our movement was at its strongest when </v>

598
00:30:08.580 --> 00:30:09.150
<v Speaker 3>tonight knights of the temple were at </v>
<v Speaker 3>their strongest,</v>

599
00:30:09.151 --> 00:30:12.730
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when cobble ism schools were flourishing</v>

600
00:30:12.731 --> 00:30:17.731
<v Speaker 3>in Spain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when the troubadours we're making their </v>

601
00:30:17.731 --> 00:30:17.800
<v Speaker 3>circuits around europe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

602
00:30:18.060 --> 00:30:20.230
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>spreading news and entertainment,</v>

603
00:30:20.231 --> 00:30:25.231
<v Speaker 3>but really probably carrying a esoteric </v>
<v Speaker 3>information to the initiates that had </v>

604
00:30:25.991 --> 00:30:30.991
<v Speaker 3>the key to the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the secret language that they use </v>

605
00:30:30.991 --> 00:30:30.991
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was very interesting time,</v>

606
00:30:31.420 --> 00:30:32.890
<v Speaker 3>but it was in that 12,</v>
<v Speaker 3>82,</v>

607
00:30:33.250 --> 00:30:35.110
<v Speaker 3>1130 to 1230,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the,</v>

608
00:30:35.870 --> 00:30:37.780
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the grail stories were written down.</v>

609
00:30:38.470 --> 00:30:43.470
<v Speaker 3>Now the grail stories actually refer </v>
<v Speaker 3>back to this period of the arthurian </v>

610
00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:45.700
<v Speaker 3>days,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the quest for the grail,</v>

611
00:30:45.701 --> 00:30:47.100
<v Speaker 3>if you recall,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was that the,</v>

612
00:30:47.260 --> 00:30:52.260
<v Speaker 3>that the land had succumbed to blight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It had become a wasteland.</v>

613
00:30:52.510 --> 00:30:57.510
<v Speaker 3>England who had become a wasteland.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the idea of the grail was it was the</v>

614
00:30:58.301 --> 00:31:03.301
<v Speaker 3>grail not only restored the wasteland </v>
<v Speaker 3>restored the king,</v>

615
00:31:03.490 --> 00:31:06.790
<v Speaker 3>because remember the king,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it was king arthur or braun,</v>

616
00:31:06.791 --> 00:31:11.410
<v Speaker 3>or on toss or the fisher king,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there were different names and different</v>

617
00:31:11.411 --> 00:31:11.740
<v Speaker 3>stories.</v>

618
00:31:11.740 --> 00:31:13.990
<v Speaker 3>It was the same deal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was sick,</v>

619
00:31:13.991 --> 00:31:15.880
<v Speaker 3>he was in decline.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was wounded,</v>

620
00:31:15.881 --> 00:31:19.480
<v Speaker 3>the wound wouldn't heal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was debilitated,</v>

621
00:31:19.510 --> 00:31:22.330
<v Speaker 3>and the only way to restore him was to </v>
<v Speaker 3>find the grail,</v>

622
00:31:22.460 --> 00:31:25.600
<v Speaker 3>bring the grail back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>allowing to drink from the grail,</v>

623
00:31:25.601 --> 00:31:30.601
<v Speaker 3>but the grail was also the means of </v>
<v Speaker 3>restoring the wasteland to fertility and</v>

624
00:31:31.750 --> 00:31:33.130
<v Speaker 3>fecundity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

625
00:31:33.580 --> 00:31:38.020
<v Speaker 3>here's where it gets interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that the dendro chronologists who who</v>

626
00:31:38.021 --> 00:31:43.021
<v Speaker 3>studied tree rings have been looking at </v>
<v Speaker 3>that period exactly in that period that </v>

627
00:31:43.501 --> 00:31:45.610
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the tradition places,</v>

628
00:31:45.700 --> 00:31:50.110
<v Speaker 3>the grail quest and have discovered that</v>
<v Speaker 3>for about eight or 10 years,</v>

629
00:31:50.111 --> 00:31:53.500
<v Speaker 3>forest growth in the northern hemisphere</v>
<v Speaker 3>almost came to a screeching halt.</v>

630
00:31:54.160 --> 00:31:56.920
<v Speaker 3>And this is now been well documented.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mike bailey,</v>

631
00:31:56.921 --> 00:32:01.921
<v Speaker 3>who's has done most of this work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm basically showing that there was a </v>

632
00:32:02.410 --> 00:32:05.710
<v Speaker 3>serious global cooling that took place </v>
<v Speaker 3>during those years.</v>

633
00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:11.640
<v Speaker 3>And the historical record of that seems </v>
<v Speaker 3>to confirm because there's multiple </v>

634
00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:16.110
<v Speaker 3>descriptions from irish monks and saw on</v>
<v Speaker 3>describinG how for weeks at a time the </v>

635
00:32:16.601 --> 00:32:19.120
<v Speaker 3>sun is not visible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you know,</v>

636
00:32:19.121 --> 00:32:21.040
<v Speaker 3>that it's darkness has come over tHe </v>
<v Speaker 3>land,</v>

637
00:32:21.041 --> 00:32:26.041
<v Speaker 3>that there were reports of these </v>
<v Speaker 3>mysterious fogbugz and then there are </v>

638
00:32:26.041 --> 00:32:27.730
<v Speaker 3>multiple collapses of agriculture.</v>

639
00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:29.200
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

640
00:32:29.770 --> 00:32:32.980
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a result of these multiyear collapses</v>

641
00:32:32.981 --> 00:32:35.950
<v Speaker 3>of agriculture because of the cold and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the dark and damp,</v>

642
00:32:36.330 --> 00:32:39.010
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people got malnourished and then you had</v>

643
00:32:39.020 --> 00:32:43.060
<v Speaker 3>famine as a result of famine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People be there,</v>

644
00:32:43.070 --> 00:32:45.800
<v Speaker 3>their immune systems became weakened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then in five,</v>

645
00:32:45.801 --> 00:32:50.801
<v Speaker 3>42 a d,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you had the onset of the justinian </v>

646
00:32:50.801 --> 00:32:54.431
<v Speaker 3>plague,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which wiped out maybe a third of the </v>

647
00:32:54.431 --> 00:32:57.011
<v Speaker 3>population of europe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whole whole villages disappeared as a </v>

648
00:32:57.011 --> 00:32:59.720
<v Speaker 3>consequence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now these events pretty much followed in</v>

649
00:32:59.721 --> 00:33:00.830
<v Speaker 3>sequence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You see,</v>

650
00:33:02.300 --> 00:33:04.720
<v Speaker 3>the cold brought about the collapse of </v>
<v Speaker 3>agriculture.</v>

651
00:33:04.730 --> 00:33:06.740
<v Speaker 3>The collapse of agriculture brought </v>
<v Speaker 3>about famine.</v>

652
00:33:06.741 --> 00:33:09.830
<v Speaker 3>Famine brought about weakness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And as a result,</v>

653
00:33:10.220 --> 00:33:15.220
<v Speaker 3>boom you have flag.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now it took european civilization nearly</v>

654
00:33:15.591 --> 00:33:20.591
<v Speaker 3>three centuries to recover from that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now what brought about the recovery was </v>

655
00:33:21.260 --> 00:33:25.130
<v Speaker 3>the return of warmth to the world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is called the medieval warm period.</v>

656
00:33:25.730 --> 00:33:30.730
<v Speaker 3>And between this began really to occur </v>
<v Speaker 3>in about 900 add this sea ice began to </v>

657
00:33:32.751 --> 00:33:35.120
<v Speaker 3>retract back well inside the arctic </v>
<v Speaker 3>circle,</v>

658
00:33:35.121 --> 00:33:37.880
<v Speaker 3>which opened up the sea lanes between </v>
<v Speaker 3>northern europe,</v>

659
00:33:37.970 --> 00:33:39.290
<v Speaker 3>Iceland,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and greenland.</v>

660
00:33:39.620 --> 00:33:41.420
<v Speaker 3>And so it was this period of time that </v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

661
00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:46.840
<v Speaker 3>that the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the vikings were able to sail to </v>

662
00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:49.151
<v Speaker 3>Iceland and then sailed to greenland and</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually establish a colonies on the </v>

663
00:33:49.151 --> 00:33:50.150
<v Speaker 3>west coast of greenland,</v>
<v Speaker 3>greenland,</v>

664
00:33:50.151 --> 00:33:55.151
<v Speaker 3>and farm or the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now the ground is perennially </v>

665
00:33:55.151 --> 00:33:55.151
<v Speaker 3>perennially frozen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me try that again.</v>

666
00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:58.160
<v Speaker 3>Per yeley frozen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

667
00:33:58.610 --> 00:34:01.520
<v Speaker 3>So it was clearly a warm period.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what happened was,</v>

668
00:34:01.610 --> 00:34:04.640
<v Speaker 3>if you look back now at the studies from</v>
<v Speaker 3>that medieval warm period,</v>

669
00:34:04.641 --> 00:34:07.540
<v Speaker 3>you see that agriculture rebounded </v>
<v Speaker 3>suddenly.</v>

670
00:34:07.550 --> 00:34:12.550
<v Speaker 3>People had lots of food to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm actually studies of skeletons show </v>

671
00:34:12.591 --> 00:34:17.210
<v Speaker 3>that the stature of humans during this </v>
<v Speaker 3>period of time increased by four or five</v>

672
00:34:17.211 --> 00:34:20.270
<v Speaker 3>inches on average from what it had been </v>
<v Speaker 3>during the dark ages.</v>

673
00:34:20.930 --> 00:34:25.930
<v Speaker 3>And I'm now europe started becoming </v>
<v Speaker 3>wealthy because the basis of all wealth </v>

674
00:34:25.930 --> 00:34:28.280
<v Speaker 3>basically was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was agriculture was food,</v>

675
00:34:28.570 --> 00:34:29.450
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Without that,</v>

676
00:34:29.660 --> 00:34:30.800
<v Speaker 3>you don't have anything else.</v>

677
00:34:31.190 --> 00:34:35.150
<v Speaker 3>Population began to expand enormously.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You see other things going on.</v>

678
00:34:35.151 --> 00:34:37.460
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lifespans increase,</v>

679
00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:42.520
<v Speaker 3>a infant mortality decrease.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All of this stuff has been well </v>

680
00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:42.800
<v Speaker 3>documented in a whole variety of </v>
<v Speaker 3>studies.</v>

681
00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:46.850
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>after about a century and a half of this</v>

682
00:34:46.970 --> 00:34:51.970
<v Speaker 3>warmth with the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the concomitant wealth that came </v>

683
00:34:51.970 --> 00:34:55.331
<v Speaker 3>along,</v>
<v Speaker 3>european society was wealthy enough to </v>

684
00:34:55.331 --> 00:34:58.100
<v Speaker 3>undertake this extraordinary cathedral </v>
<v Speaker 3>building phase.</v>

685
00:34:58.370 --> 00:35:02.360
<v Speaker 3>You see where you had literally hundreds</v>
<v Speaker 3>of thousands of highly trained,</v>

686
00:35:02.361 --> 00:35:05.420
<v Speaker 3>highly skilled crafts people working on </v>
<v Speaker 3>these things.</v>

687
00:35:05.421 --> 00:35:10.421
<v Speaker 3>You had essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you begin to look at the cathedral </v>

688
00:35:10.421 --> 00:35:14.081
<v Speaker 3>building phenomenon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it required the basically the </v>

689
00:35:14.081 --> 00:35:17.570
<v Speaker 3>mobilization of of the whole of european</v>
<v Speaker 3>society behind this enterprise,</v>

690
00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:22.130
<v Speaker 3>because you had to cory mounts of stone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you had to transport these stones,</v>

691
00:35:22.131 --> 00:35:25.220
<v Speaker 3>you had the car of the stones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you look at the statuary,</v>

692
00:35:25.221 --> 00:35:28.190
<v Speaker 3>the stain glass,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is exceptional,</v>

693
00:35:28.191 --> 00:35:32.840
<v Speaker 3>and it's in its refractive properties </v>
<v Speaker 3>that really have still not been mimicked</v>

694
00:35:32.870 --> 00:35:33.500
<v Speaker 3>to this day.</v>

695
00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:38.500
<v Speaker 3>The way the stained glass was able to </v>
<v Speaker 3>refract light so that it gives the </v>

696
00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:41.460
<v Speaker 3>appearance of of not the light coming </v>
<v Speaker 3>shining through the glass,</v>

697
00:35:41.490 --> 00:35:45.840
<v Speaker 3>but emanating from within the glass and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you could go on and on with this.</v>

698
00:35:45.841 --> 00:35:46.160
<v Speaker 3>ThE,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

699
00:35:46.161 --> 00:35:47.660
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the carpentry scaled,</v>

700
00:35:47.661 --> 00:35:52.661
<v Speaker 3>the engineering skill,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the astronomy that went into these </v>

701
00:35:52.661 --> 00:35:55.851
<v Speaker 3>structures.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All of this combined basically shows up </v>

702
00:35:55.851 --> 00:36:00.350
<v Speaker 3>basically in historical instant and in </v>
<v Speaker 3>what's interesting is the scarcity of,</v>

703
00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:06.680
<v Speaker 3>of evidence showing what proceeded this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How did these,</v>

704
00:36:08.370 --> 00:36:11.190
<v Speaker 3>who organized this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who raised the money,</v>

705
00:36:11.191 --> 00:36:12.960
<v Speaker 3>who trained the craftsman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

706
00:36:12.961 --> 00:36:14.130
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are,</v>

707
00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:17.370
<v Speaker 3>there are references to this in history,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but really,</v>

708
00:36:17.970 --> 00:36:22.970
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no explicit detailed discussion </v>

709
00:36:22.970 --> 00:36:22.970
<v Speaker 3>where we can go and trace it and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

710
00:36:22.970 --> 00:36:24.060
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is how it happened.</v>

711
00:36:24.410 --> 00:36:29.410
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's important to realize that this </v>

712
00:36:29.410 --> 00:36:29.610
<v Speaker 3>was a consequence of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

713
00:36:29.611 --> 00:36:31.020
<v Speaker 3>of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

714
00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:32.760
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the expansion of,</v>

715
00:36:32.761 --> 00:36:35.700
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of wealth in european society that,</v>

716
00:36:36.140 --> 00:36:38.940
<v Speaker 3>that was able to allow this to happen.</v>

717
00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:41.240
<v Speaker 3>And that's as a consequence of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>warmth,</v>

718
00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:46.360
<v Speaker 3>the warmth of the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what we see is that the cathedral </v>

719
00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:50.001
<v Speaker 3>building era comes to a sudden </v>
<v Speaker 3>termination in nearly 13 hundreds.</v>

720
00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:53.400
<v Speaker 3>And if you Go on your travel around a </v>
<v Speaker 3>cathedrals,</v>

721
00:36:53.401 --> 00:36:54.900
<v Speaker 3>you'll find that there is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in many cases,</v>

722
00:36:54.901 --> 00:36:59.901
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the record suggests that it's almost as </v>

723
00:36:59.901 --> 00:37:02.241
<v Speaker 3>if in the middle of their work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the workman laid down their tools and </v>

724
00:37:02.241 --> 00:37:06.171
<v Speaker 3>left in some cases.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is why there were so many </v>

725
00:37:06.171 --> 00:37:06.540
<v Speaker 3>cathedrals of the great ones that </v>
<v Speaker 3>weren't finished.</v>

726
00:37:06.890 --> 00:37:11.890
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what you see is that exactly </v>

727
00:37:12.451 --> 00:37:16.170
<v Speaker 3>concurring with the cessation of </v>
<v Speaker 3>cathedral building within a day,</v>

728
00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:21.200
<v Speaker 3>within a few decades anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was the onset to the little ice age and </v>

729
00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:25.671
<v Speaker 3>the return of the cold and this first </v>
<v Speaker 3>phase of the little ice age again </v>

730
00:37:25.741 --> 00:37:28.830
<v Speaker 3>brought about agricultural collapses at </v>
<v Speaker 3>brought about famine.</v>

731
00:37:28.831 --> 00:37:31.440
<v Speaker 3>And then you had the black plague that </v>
<v Speaker 3>showed up,</v>

732
00:37:31.441 --> 00:37:32.700
<v Speaker 3>I think around,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whAt was it?</v>

733
00:37:32.700 --> 00:37:35.880
<v Speaker 3>13 slash 30 slash 1340 right in there </v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

734
00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:40.200
<v Speaker 3>decimated the civilization of europe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you can see,</v>

735
00:37:40.201 --> 00:37:43.620
<v Speaker 3>I mean if we look at the historical </v>
<v Speaker 3>record,</v>

736
00:37:43.621 --> 00:37:48.621
<v Speaker 3>what we see is the times of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of global warming have actually been </v>

737
00:37:48.621 --> 00:37:52.080
<v Speaker 3>times of advancement in civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

738
00:37:52.081 --> 00:37:52.950
<v Speaker 3>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>That there,</v>

739
00:37:52.960 --> 00:37:54.900
<v Speaker 3>that would have its limit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean we could get to,</v>

740
00:37:55.110 --> 00:38:00.110
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at some point where we would get too </v>

741
00:38:00.110 --> 00:38:00.120
<v Speaker 3>warm in yours.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But so far what we've seen,</v>

742
00:38:00.210 --> 00:38:03.780
<v Speaker 3>we're at this point well within the </v>
<v Speaker 3>range of natural variability.</v>

743
00:38:03.930 --> 00:38:07.260
<v Speaker 3>That's the why is this never brought up </v>
<v Speaker 3>by anybody but you.</v>

744
00:38:07.350 --> 00:38:10.830
<v Speaker 3>I've never heard anybody else discuss </v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

745
00:38:10.890 --> 00:38:14.730
<v Speaker 3>this very controversial subject.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's controversial because everyone's so</v>

746
00:38:14.731 --> 00:38:17.340
<v Speaker 3>fixated on global warming being a bad </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

747
00:38:17.430 --> 00:38:20.130
<v Speaker 3>It's there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's there for anybody who is willing to</v>

748
00:38:20.131 --> 00:38:21.560
<v Speaker 3>do their homework,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

749
00:38:21.570 --> 00:38:25.590
<v Speaker 3>and if somebody goes on my website or </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever and says,</v>

750
00:38:25.591 --> 00:38:26.490
<v Speaker 3>what are your sources?</v>

751
00:38:26.490 --> 00:38:29.940
<v Speaker 3>I'm glad to provide multiple,</v>
<v Speaker 3>multiple sources going back.</v>

752
00:38:29.941 --> 00:38:34.941
<v Speaker 3>I've been,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been collecting this data for </v>

753
00:38:34.941 --> 00:38:34.941
<v Speaker 3>decades,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

754
00:38:34.941 --> 00:38:35.410
<v Speaker 3>and it's there and I have to ask the </v>
<v Speaker 3>same question.</v>

755
00:38:35.650 --> 00:38:38.280
<v Speaker 3>Why are we ignoring this evidence?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

756
00:38:38.350 --> 00:38:39.080
<v Speaker 3>why are we.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

757
00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:44.280
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we're ignoring it because </v>

758
00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:46.291
<v Speaker 3>climate change has become a political </v>
<v Speaker 3>agenda rather rather than a scientific </v>

759
00:38:46.811 --> 00:38:48.190
<v Speaker 3>question,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

760
00:38:48.430 --> 00:38:52.000
<v Speaker 3>and so because there are political </v>
<v Speaker 3>factions that are lined up behind it.</v>

761
00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:53.590
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

762
00:38:54.120 --> 00:38:58.930
<v Speaker 3>the inner intergovernmental panel on </v>
<v Speaker 3>climate change is now looked at as being</v>

763
00:38:58.931 --> 00:39:02.080
<v Speaker 3>the ultimate source for data on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the climate.</v>

764
00:39:03.100 --> 00:39:08.100
<v Speaker 3>And bear in mind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were created by the united nations </v>

765
00:39:08.100 --> 00:39:11.371
<v Speaker 3>framework convention on climate change </v>
<v Speaker 3>and given the mandate of go out there </v>

766
00:39:11.371 --> 00:39:11.500
<v Speaker 3>and demonstrate that humans are causing </v>
<v Speaker 3>climate change.</v>

767
00:39:11.501 --> 00:39:13.480
<v Speaker 3>So right from the very start,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was their mission.</v>

768
00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:19.080
<v Speaker 3>And they were not told go and look for </v>
<v Speaker 3>natural causes of natural climate </v>

769
00:39:19.080 --> 00:39:20.660
<v Speaker 3>variability,</v>
<v Speaker 3>study the human and.</v>

770
00:39:20.660 --> 00:39:25.660
<v Speaker 3>And it's important and I mean I'm not at</v>
<v Speaker 3>all saying it's not important for us to </v>

771
00:39:25.660 --> 00:39:29.170
<v Speaker 3>study our own effects on climate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's going to be dangerous.</v>

772
00:39:29.171 --> 00:39:31.420
<v Speaker 3>I think if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we neglect,</v>

773
00:39:31.750 --> 00:39:36.750
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what we're seeing right here on these </v>

774
00:39:36.750 --> 00:39:38.521
<v Speaker 3>graphs or this graph that I'm showing </v>
<v Speaker 3>you because that's clearly not carbon </v>

775
00:39:38.521 --> 00:39:38.920
<v Speaker 3>dioxide.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See if we're told,</v>

776
00:39:38.921 --> 00:39:43.921
<v Speaker 3>and we have been repeatedly told that </v>
<v Speaker 3>carbon dioxide concentrations in the </v>

777
00:39:43.921 --> 00:39:46.750
<v Speaker 3>atmosphere held relatively steady at </v>
<v Speaker 3>about 280 parts per million,</v>

778
00:39:47.530 --> 00:39:52.530
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Prior to the industrial revolution and </v>

779
00:39:52.530 --> 00:39:52.780
<v Speaker 3>only subsequent to the industrial </v>
<v Speaker 3>revolution.</v>

780
00:39:53.380 --> 00:39:55.870
<v Speaker 3>Did cArbon dIoxide start going up?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

781
00:39:55.900 --> 00:39:58.550
<v Speaker 3>if we assume just for the sake of </v>
<v Speaker 3>argument that,</v>

782
00:39:58.660 --> 00:39:59.770
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's correct.</v>

783
00:40:00.220 --> 00:40:05.220
<v Speaker 3>We'll look at this graph.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What we're saying is that if carbon </v>

784
00:40:05.220 --> 00:40:07.510
<v Speaker 3>dioxide held steady at 280 parts per </v>
<v Speaker 3>million going back hundreds of thousands</v>

785
00:40:07.511 --> 00:40:11.560
<v Speaker 3>of years as al gore is actually stated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and as many others have stated,</v>

786
00:40:12.790 --> 00:40:15.340
<v Speaker 3>it's not carbon dioxide driving those </v>
<v Speaker 3>climate changes,</v>

787
00:40:15.341 --> 00:40:15.640
<v Speaker 3>is it?</v>

788
00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:17.670
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it can't be that it can't be new.</v>

789
00:40:17.690 --> 00:40:19.540
<v Speaker 3>if that's the case,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's hard science,</v>

790
00:40:19.730 --> 00:40:21.100
<v Speaker 3>this is hard science,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

791
00:40:21.380 --> 00:40:22.850
<v Speaker 3>It's hard science as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're.</v>

792
00:40:22.851 --> 00:40:24.790
<v Speaker 3>You're looking at something really </v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy.</v>

793
00:40:24.850 --> 00:40:26.160
<v Speaker 3>Some event.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

794
00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:27.760
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's my point.</v>

795
00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:30.070
<v Speaker 3>Now the alternative is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

796
00:40:30.130 --> 00:40:31.360
<v Speaker 3>are we saying if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>

797
00:40:31.630 --> 00:40:36.630
<v Speaker 3>if carbon dioxide is the dominant driver</v>
<v Speaker 3>of climate change and that's what we're </v>

798
00:40:36.630 --> 00:40:41.431
<v Speaker 3>seeing here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then what that basically says is that </v>

799
00:40:41.431 --> 00:40:45.931
<v Speaker 3>there is some gigantic unknown </v>
<v Speaker 3>reservoirs of co two that have outgassed</v>

800
00:40:46.421 --> 00:40:51.421
<v Speaker 3>into the atmosphere,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which again undermines the so called </v>

801
00:40:51.421 --> 00:40:52.670
<v Speaker 3>consensus view because so far the </v>
<v Speaker 3>consensus view,</v>

802
00:40:52.671 --> 00:40:57.671
<v Speaker 3>the consensus view states that the ceo </v>
<v Speaker 3>has only increased because of burning </v>

803
00:40:57.821 --> 00:41:02.821
<v Speaker 3>fossil fuel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this graph is the real inconvenient </v>

804
00:41:02.821 --> 00:41:04.750
<v Speaker 3>truth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This graph that's well put.</v>

805
00:41:04.780 --> 00:41:09.780
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this graph is the real inconvenient </v>

806
00:41:09.780 --> 00:41:09.940
<v Speaker 3>truth and when we look at some of this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean right there,</v>

807
00:41:10.240 --> 00:41:15.240
<v Speaker 3>that is a major global warming right </v>
<v Speaker 3>there because this dashed line </v>

808
00:41:15.240 --> 00:41:17.040
<v Speaker 3>represents the modern temperature like </v>
<v Speaker 3>the date,</v>

809
00:41:17.290 --> 00:41:19.750
<v Speaker 3>the 20th century average is this dash </v>
<v Speaker 3>line,</v>

810
00:41:19.780 --> 00:41:22.480
<v Speaker 3>that dash line.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What year are we looking at?</v>

811
00:41:22.481 --> 00:41:23.530
<v Speaker 3>Right there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right here.</v>

812
00:41:23.531 --> 00:41:26.620
<v Speaker 3>This is between 100 and 150,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago,</v>

813
00:41:26.680 --> 00:41:29.650
<v Speaker 3>and that's a giant jump.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a gIant joe.</v>

814
00:41:29.860 --> 00:41:30.580
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so what,</v>

815
00:41:30.581 --> 00:41:33.130
<v Speaker 3>what does that represent as far as </v>
<v Speaker 3>degrees in temperature?</v>

816
00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:33.830
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

817
00:41:33.831 --> 00:41:34.040
<v Speaker 3>let's</v>

818
00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:35.630
<v Speaker 1>see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's probably going to be,</v>

819
00:41:35.631 --> 00:41:37.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>15 to 18 degrees fahrenheit.</v>

820
00:41:37.610 --> 00:41:38.370
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

821
00:41:38.510 --> 00:41:39.440
<v Speaker 1>right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>

822
00:41:39.500 --> 00:41:40.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

823
00:41:40.460 --> 00:41:43.760
<v Speaker 1>15 to 18 times greater than the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>than the,</v>

824
00:41:43.810 --> 00:41:47.720
<v Speaker 1>the presumed temperature increase of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>last century.</v>

825
00:41:47.750 --> 00:41:52.750
<v Speaker 1>Is there any mainstream,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't say mainstream scientific </v>

826
00:41:52.750 --> 00:41:54.510
<v Speaker 1>explanation for what that is?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

827
00:41:54.610 --> 00:41:57.260
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's called the eemian called the eemian</v>

828
00:41:57.290 --> 00:42:00.590
<v Speaker 1>periods in interglacial period,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but even within the interglacial period,</v>

829
00:42:00.591 --> 00:42:03.140
<v Speaker 1>you see that there are these massive </v>
<v Speaker 1>oscillations,</v>

830
00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:06.230
<v Speaker 1>massive cooling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cooling and warming again.</v>

831
00:42:06.260 --> 00:42:11.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there's a variability if you're </v>

832
00:42:11.260 --> 00:42:11.990
<v Speaker 1>saying the warming is between it's 18 </v>
<v Speaker 1>degrees.</v>

833
00:42:11.991 --> 00:42:14.420
<v Speaker 1>That what you said to up to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the cooling,</v>

834
00:42:14.450 --> 00:42:17.870
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about almost that much in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other direction.</v>

835
00:42:17.871 --> 00:42:19.190
<v Speaker 1>The other direction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

836
00:42:19.240 --> 00:42:22.130
<v Speaker 1>And who you're talking about this over a</v>
<v Speaker 1>period of just a few decades.</v>

837
00:42:22.430 --> 00:42:24.170
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as we get back this far,</v>

838
00:42:24.171 --> 00:42:27.140
<v Speaker 1>we don't have the same degree of </v>
<v Speaker 1>precision is we do when we're,</v>

839
00:42:27.290 --> 00:42:27.860
<v Speaker 1>we're here.</v>

840
00:42:28.220 --> 00:42:29.990
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps yes,</v>

841
00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:35.080
<v Speaker 1>but we were not sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we do know that these changes that </v>

842
00:42:35.080 --> 00:42:37.430
<v Speaker 1>we're looking at here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the terminated the last ice age.</v>

843
00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:39.860
<v Speaker 1>We're just in a matter of a few years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

844
00:42:40.340 --> 00:42:45.340
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the instantaneous nature of those is</v>

845
00:42:45.381 --> 00:42:50.381
<v Speaker 1>what you focus on when you start talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about asteroidal impacts and things </v>

846
00:42:50.381 --> 00:42:53.390
<v Speaker 1>along those lines of that is something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we can explain.</v>

847
00:42:53.610 --> 00:42:56.840
<v Speaker 1>It's something you can point to by </v>
<v Speaker 1>default.</v>

848
00:42:56.900 --> 00:43:01.900
<v Speaker 1>There doesn't seem to be a lot of other </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that we can invoke to explain </v>

849
00:43:01.900 --> 00:43:06.400
<v Speaker 1>what we're seeing right here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's absolute evidence that we </v>

850
00:43:06.400 --> 00:43:08.510
<v Speaker 1>have been hit multiple times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to get into that.</v>

851
00:43:08.511 --> 00:43:09.590
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

852
00:43:09.830 --> 00:43:11.650
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's a big part of what,</v>

853
00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:13.550
<v Speaker 1>what graham's book is going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>amazing.</v>

854
00:43:13.551 --> 00:43:18.551
<v Speaker 1>when you look at the ancient history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's not even ancient as far as </v>

855
00:43:18.551 --> 00:43:20.030
<v Speaker 1>me and they were human beinGs living </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of like us,</v>

856
00:43:20.540 --> 00:43:23.840
<v Speaker 1>but how much different the climate was </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

857
00:43:23.841 --> 00:43:25.280
<v Speaker 1>it was so fucked up.</v>

858
00:43:25.820 --> 00:43:27.650
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure about the west coast,</v>

859
00:43:27.651 --> 00:43:30.350
<v Speaker 1>but I know on the east coast there were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

860
00:43:30.351 --> 00:43:34.760
<v Speaker 1>swarms of icebergs stranding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like off the coast of South Carolina,</v>

861
00:43:35.060 --> 00:43:36.620
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

862
00:43:36.740 --> 00:43:40.370
<v Speaker 1>there was no great lakes because of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>great lakes were under thousands of feet</v>

863
00:43:40.371 --> 00:43:41.210
<v Speaker 1>of ice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

864
00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:43.100
<v Speaker 1>New York,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boston,</v>

865
00:43:43.310 --> 00:43:44.870
<v Speaker 1>detroit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

866
00:43:44.900 --> 00:43:46.550
<v Speaker 1>seattle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>portland,</v>

867
00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:48.920
<v Speaker 1>or not sort of a portland,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but seattle,</v>

868
00:43:49.220 --> 00:43:50.810
<v Speaker 1>twin cities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chicago.</v>

869
00:43:50.811 --> 00:43:53.960
<v Speaker 1>All of these areas were under thousands </v>
<v Speaker 1>of feet of ice,</v>

870
00:43:54.740 --> 00:43:59.740
<v Speaker 1>thousands of feet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we're not talking millions of years </v>

871
00:43:59.740 --> 00:43:59.740
<v Speaker 1>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're talking 12,</v>

872
00:43:59.740 --> 00:44:02.570
<v Speaker 1>13,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>to 25 to 30,000</v>

873
00:44:02.571 --> 00:44:04.070
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's incredible.</v>

874
00:44:04.130 --> 00:44:04.780
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

875
00:44:04.781 --> 00:44:07.940
<v Speaker 1>and sea levels were basically in round </v>
<v Speaker 1>numbers,</v>

876
00:44:07.941 --> 00:44:12.941
<v Speaker 1>400 feet lower than now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which essentially exposes the entire </v>

877
00:44:13.390 --> 00:44:15.170
<v Speaker 1>con.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of the continental shelves.</v>

878
00:44:15.171 --> 00:44:16.190
<v Speaker 1>And I'm going to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got some,</v>

879
00:44:16.250 --> 00:44:18.440
<v Speaker 1>some interesting graphics here to show </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

880
00:44:18.890 --> 00:44:19.840
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

881
00:44:19.910 --> 00:44:22.430
<v Speaker 1>what continental coastlines would have </v>
<v Speaker 1>looked like.</v>

882
00:44:22.490 --> 00:44:27.490
<v Speaker 1>There was an article that I was reading </v>
<v Speaker 1>recently about aborigines in aboriginal </v>

883
00:44:27.490 --> 00:44:27.650
<v Speaker 1>tales of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

884
00:44:28.130 --> 00:44:31.890
<v Speaker 1>of the lowered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like lowered levels</v>

885
00:44:32.110 --> 00:44:37.110
<v Speaker 3>that they're starting to correspond now </v>
<v Speaker 3>with actual climate data and </v>

886
00:44:37.110 --> 00:44:37.800
<v Speaker 3>understanding of what the sea levels </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually war at that time.</v>

887
00:44:38.010 --> 00:44:40.230
<v Speaker 3>And these are stories that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>supposedly 10,000</v>

888
00:44:40.231 --> 00:44:45.231
<v Speaker 3>years old pass through oral traditions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These traditions to me are just beyond </v>

889
00:44:46.231 --> 00:44:47.500
<v Speaker 3>valuable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

890
00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:52.080
<v Speaker 3>up until very recently they have been </v>
<v Speaker 3>considered basically just,</v>

891
00:44:52.370 --> 00:44:54.300
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting in the,</v>

892
00:44:54.350 --> 00:44:59.350
<v Speaker 3>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the anthropological or psychological </v>

893
00:44:59.350 --> 00:45:02.121
<v Speaker 3>sense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but had no real hard scientific </v>

894
00:45:02.121 --> 00:45:06.680
<v Speaker 3>credibility to them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now I think we're beginning to </v>

895
00:45:06.680 --> 00:45:10.281
<v Speaker 3>reevaluate them near as an archeologist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this archeologist by the name of Bruce </v>

896
00:45:10.281 --> 00:45:15.170
<v Speaker 3>Massey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's been doing some very interesting </v>

897
00:45:15.170 --> 00:45:16.560
<v Speaker 3>work in for the last 20 years analyzing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

898
00:45:16.590 --> 00:45:21.590
<v Speaker 3>many of these ancient myths and </v>
<v Speaker 3>realizing and putting out there the </v>

899
00:45:21.590 --> 00:45:26.031
<v Speaker 3>argument that these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that these myths and these legends in </v>

900
00:45:26.031 --> 00:45:29.721
<v Speaker 3>these epic tales a code really hard </v>
<v Speaker 3>scientific information that we could </v>

901
00:45:30.991 --> 00:45:34.640
<v Speaker 3>extract from them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm talking about global changes and</v>

902
00:45:34.650 --> 00:45:36.840
<v Speaker 3>astronomical events and so forth.</v>

903
00:45:36.840 --> 00:45:37.990
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and um,</v>

904
00:45:38.820 --> 00:45:43.820
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I've been a believer in that for a </v>

905
00:45:43.820 --> 00:45:43.820
<v Speaker 3>long time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

906
00:45:43.820 --> 00:45:45.180
<v Speaker 3>and this is one of the premises of </v>
<v Speaker 3>graham's work is that,</v>

907
00:45:45.690 --> 00:45:50.690
<v Speaker 3>that the myths and the legends actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>have a great deal to teach us beyond </v>

908
00:45:50.690 --> 00:45:55.251
<v Speaker 3>just the psychological orientation of </v>
<v Speaker 3>our ignorant pre-scientific ancestors,</v>

909
00:45:55.590 --> 00:45:56.730
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

910
00:45:57.060 --> 00:45:59.210
<v Speaker 3>a good point you make there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

911
00:45:59.670 --> 00:46:02.010
<v Speaker 3>when we look at this graph,</v>
<v Speaker 3>basically what we're seeing here is that</v>

912
00:46:02.011 --> 00:46:05.100
<v Speaker 3>coming out of the ice age,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can kind of see that we're coming up</v>

913
00:46:05.101 --> 00:46:10.101
<v Speaker 3>here and then we have this massive spike</v>
<v Speaker 3>of warming and then it seesaws back down</v>

914
00:46:11.731 --> 00:46:15.600
<v Speaker 3>into this full glacial cold.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is called this period between these</v>

915
00:46:15.601 --> 00:46:18.720
<v Speaker 3>two green arrows is called the younger </v>
<v Speaker 3>dryas,</v>

916
00:46:19.410 --> 00:46:24.410
<v Speaker 3>which is named after a polar wildflower </v>
<v Speaker 3>that had disappeared in northern europe </v>

917
00:46:24.410 --> 00:46:27.510
<v Speaker 3>and then suddenly came back again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It only grows in polar environments,</v>

918
00:46:27.680 --> 00:46:29.280
<v Speaker 3>a dry us octa patella.</v>

919
00:46:29.760 --> 00:46:33.840
<v Speaker 3>So the younger dryas compared because </v>
<v Speaker 3>there was an older darius too,</v>

920
00:46:34.230 --> 00:46:39.230
<v Speaker 3>but it lasted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now the dates are placing it from </v>

921
00:46:39.230 --> 00:46:39.390
<v Speaker 3>roughly 12,000,</v>
<v Speaker 3>900 years ago,</v>

922
00:46:39.570 --> 00:46:42.960
<v Speaker 3>give or take a few decades to 11,600</v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago.</v>

923
00:46:43.440 --> 00:46:48.360
<v Speaker 3>So this spike of warming right here is </v>
<v Speaker 3>11,600</v>

924
00:46:48.361 --> 00:46:49.380
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

925
00:46:49.381 --> 00:46:54.381
<v Speaker 3>if we look at the next one here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this graph basically goes to a different</v>

926
00:46:55.021 --> 00:46:59.220
<v Speaker 3>realm of evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>and what this shows is the average,</v>

927
00:46:59.250 --> 00:47:04.250
<v Speaker 3>the rate of sea level rise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You see now oceanographers marine </v>

928
00:47:05.671 --> 00:47:07.860
<v Speaker 3>geologists have been studying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There'S,</v>

929
00:47:07.920 --> 00:47:11.010
<v Speaker 3>there's a number of dIfferent ways they </v>
<v Speaker 3>can correlate this information.</v>

930
00:47:11.011 --> 00:47:14.010
<v Speaker 3>They can look at actual evidence of </v>
<v Speaker 3>submerged shorelines,</v>

931
00:47:14.011 --> 00:47:16.790
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can look at changes in the,</v>

932
00:47:16.850 --> 00:47:20.370
<v Speaker 3>in the flora and the fauna that have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that have lived in the oceans.</v>

933
00:47:20.640 --> 00:47:22.750
<v Speaker 3>They can look at coRal reefs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

934
00:47:22.980 --> 00:47:27.980
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of different things that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they can pull together to see how </v>

935
00:47:27.980 --> 00:47:32.230
<v Speaker 3>rapidly sea levels rose at the end of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the last ice age and again,</v>

936
00:47:32.550 --> 00:47:33.820
<v Speaker 3>generation or two ago.</v>

937
00:47:33.820 --> 00:47:38.820
<v Speaker 3>The assumption was is that there was a </v>
<v Speaker 3>smooth continuum of rise that took tens </v>

938
00:47:38.820 --> 00:47:39.610
<v Speaker 3>of thousands of years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

939
00:47:40.510 --> 00:47:43.690
<v Speaker 3>To get us from minus 400 feet up to what</v>
<v Speaker 3>we are now.</v>

940
00:47:43.691 --> 00:47:47.050
<v Speaker 3>At the present level,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what this graph shows is that there were</v>

941
00:47:47.051 --> 00:47:50.950
<v Speaker 3>two massive spikes of meltwater </v>
<v Speaker 3>introduced into the oceans,</v>

942
00:47:51.010 --> 00:47:53.410
<v Speaker 3>into the global oceans at the end of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>last ice age,</v>

943
00:47:53.770 --> 00:47:58.770
<v Speaker 3>and you can see The first spike called </v>
<v Speaker 3>meltwater pulse one a is the biggest </v>

944
00:47:59.860 --> 00:48:02.290
<v Speaker 3>followed by another one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>meltwater pulse one b.</v>

945
00:48:02.980 --> 00:48:07.980
<v Speaker 3>If we go back to this graph right here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those two spikes of glacial melt water </v>

946
00:48:09.281 --> 00:48:12.970
<v Speaker 3>and sea level rise coincided with this </v>
<v Speaker 3>warming spike and net warming spike,</v>

947
00:48:12.971 --> 00:48:17.971
<v Speaker 3>and you can see how this warming spike </v>
<v Speaker 3>seems to be the most intense followed by</v>

948
00:48:18.251 --> 00:48:21.520
<v Speaker 3>this one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we see that meltwater pulse one a is</v>

949
00:48:21.521 --> 00:48:24.740
<v Speaker 3>the biggest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what this is showing is that the,</v>

950
00:48:24.860 --> 00:48:27.340
<v Speaker 3>that the rise in sea level was not as </v>
<v Speaker 3>smooth.</v>

951
00:48:27.880 --> 00:48:28.960
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whoa.</v>

952
00:48:29.620 --> 00:48:34.620
<v Speaker 3>And then warm up again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there was something that caused all </v>

953
00:48:34.620 --> 00:48:35.890
<v Speaker 3>those glaciers to melt within just a </v>
<v Speaker 3>very short amount of time.</v>

954
00:48:35.950 --> 00:48:37.420
<v Speaker 3>A geologically speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

955
00:48:37.421 --> 00:48:39.490
<v Speaker 3>a geological instant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

956
00:48:40.420 --> 00:48:43.180
<v Speaker 3>What's further interesting is when we </v>
<v Speaker 3>look at this graph,</v>

957
00:48:43.780 --> 00:48:46.510
<v Speaker 3>this is the late pleistocene mortality </v>
<v Speaker 3>graph,</v>

958
00:48:46.780 --> 00:48:51.780
<v Speaker 3>and each square represents a fossil </v>
<v Speaker 3>specimen of an extinct mammal.</v>

959
00:48:53.250 --> 00:48:54.760
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>could be a woolly mammoth,</v>

960
00:48:55.150 --> 00:48:58.060
<v Speaker 3>could be a giant ground sloth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>could be a saber tooth cat,</v>

961
00:48:58.090 --> 00:49:03.090
<v Speaker 3>could be the giant cave bear roughly 120</v>
<v Speaker 3>species of mega mammals that lived </v>

962
00:49:05.350 --> 00:49:10.350
<v Speaker 3>during the ice age when extinct right at</v>
<v Speaker 3>the end of the ice age in basically what</v>

963
00:49:11.351 --> 00:49:16.240
<v Speaker 3>this graph is showing us here is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you probably can't read this here,</v>

964
00:49:16.241 --> 00:49:18.940
<v Speaker 3>so oh interpreted for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you go back to here,</v>

965
00:49:19.360 --> 00:49:24.360
<v Speaker 3>the left side represents 50,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago and here were where the cursor</v>

966
00:49:25.001 --> 00:49:26.110
<v Speaker 3>is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's 40,000</v>

967
00:49:26.111 --> 00:49:28.060
<v Speaker 3>years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>30,000,</v>

968
00:49:28.480 --> 00:49:33.480
<v Speaker 3>20,000,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you see that as we're going along </v>

969
00:49:33.480 --> 00:49:33.480
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>

970
00:49:33.480 --> 00:49:36.010
<v Speaker 3>Each one of these squares represents the</v>
<v Speaker 3>finding of a fossil,</v>

971
00:49:36.040 --> 00:49:39.130
<v Speaker 3>of an extinct mammal in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the fossil record.</v>

972
00:49:39.640 --> 00:49:44.500
<v Speaker 3>What we see from this graph is that when</v>
<v Speaker 3>we get to between 11 and 13,000</v>

973
00:49:44.501 --> 00:49:49.501
<v Speaker 3>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a massive spike of calendar </v>

974
00:49:49.501 --> 00:49:52.590
<v Speaker 3>shoots through the roof.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This demise of these animals directly </v>

975
00:49:52.590 --> 00:49:56.170
<v Speaker 3>coincided directly coincides with this </v>
<v Speaker 3>right here directly.</v>

976
00:49:57.550 --> 00:50:02.550
<v Speaker 3>Now what we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what we're dealing with is that for 50 </v>

977
00:50:02.550 --> 00:50:06.061
<v Speaker 3>years the dominant theory has been,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is called overkill or blitzkrieg and </v>

978
00:50:07.211 --> 00:50:11.340
<v Speaker 3>this theory basically states that bands </v>
<v Speaker 3>have paleo.</v>

979
00:50:11.341 --> 00:50:14.050
<v Speaker 3>Indian hunters came across the bering </v>
<v Speaker 3>land bridge,</v>

980
00:50:14.140 --> 00:50:19.140
<v Speaker 3>slaughtering every animal that they </v>
<v Speaker 3>encountered along the way and somehow </v>

981
00:50:19.140 --> 00:50:23.821
<v Speaker 3>within less than a thousand years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>swept from siberia down to tierra del </v>

982
00:50:23.821 --> 00:50:26.650
<v Speaker 3>fuego and killed off every willie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every man within the world,</v>

983
00:50:28.130 --> 00:50:30.890
<v Speaker 3>and presumably every other of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>extinct mammals.</v>

984
00:50:30.891 --> 00:50:32.510
<v Speaker 3>And that has been the dominant theory </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

985
00:50:32.600 --> 00:50:35.480
<v Speaker 3>that humans caused this mass extinction.</v>

986
00:50:36.980 --> 00:50:41.300
<v Speaker 3>And personally I think that's just </v>
<v Speaker 3>absurd because for one thing,</v>

987
00:50:41.540 --> 00:50:46.540
<v Speaker 3>based upon anthropological studies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there were possibly more wooly mammoths </v>

988
00:50:46.540 --> 00:50:48.470
<v Speaker 3>in the world and there were people for </v>
<v Speaker 3>awhile.</v>

989
00:50:48.860 --> 00:50:49.970
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

990
00:50:49.971 --> 00:50:54.971
<v Speaker 3>you have to assume that the blitz creek </v>
<v Speaker 3>was so instantaneous and so all </v>

991
00:50:54.971 --> 00:50:57.250
<v Speaker 3>encompassing that there was no time even</v>
<v Speaker 3>for the mammas to,</v>

992
00:50:57.320 --> 00:50:59.510
<v Speaker 3>to reproduce.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course,</v>

993
00:50:59.960 --> 00:51:04.960
<v Speaker 3>the overkill hypothesis basically </v>
<v Speaker 3>addresses itself only to Willie May or </v>

994
00:51:04.960 --> 00:51:09.280
<v Speaker 3>only to mammoths.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wooly mammoths were one species of four </v>

995
00:51:09.280 --> 00:51:12.221
<v Speaker 3>different species of mammals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what about the other roughly 120 </v>

996
00:51:12.221 --> 00:51:12.221
<v Speaker 3>species?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What about the,</v>

997
00:51:12.221 --> 00:51:17.000
<v Speaker 3>the giant armadillos into a giant </v>
<v Speaker 3>beavers in the american place to see </v>

998
00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:18.360
<v Speaker 3>lion that was as big as big as a horse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

999
00:51:18.890 --> 00:51:21.290
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the list goes on and on and on and on in</v>

1000
00:51:21.291 --> 00:51:26.291
<v Speaker 3>these animals all basically disappeared </v>
<v Speaker 3>during this spike that you see right </v>

1001
00:51:26.291 --> 00:51:30.611
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that spike faults exactlY between </v>

1002
00:51:30.611 --> 00:51:31.670
<v Speaker 3>these two warming spikes and between the</v>
<v Speaker 3>two sea level rises.</v>

1003
00:51:31.700 --> 00:51:35.990
<v Speaker 3>So all the data,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all points that same time period.</v>

1004
00:51:36.050 --> 00:51:37.520
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1005
00:51:38.210 --> 00:51:40.100
<v Speaker 3>And so what I'm saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is,</v>

1006
00:51:40.550 --> 00:51:41.810
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1007
00:51:42.190 --> 00:51:47.190
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>basically consistent with what graham </v>

1008
00:51:47.190 --> 00:51:47.190
<v Speaker 3>singh and his book is that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

1009
00:51:47.190 --> 00:51:47.450
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what we're seeing here,</v>

1010
00:51:47.451 --> 00:51:52.451
<v Speaker 3>this episode basically represents a </v>
<v Speaker 3>curtain that has come down and obscured </v>

1011
00:51:52.451 --> 00:51:57.190
<v Speaker 3>150,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>or more years of deep human history and </v>

1012
00:51:57.190 --> 00:51:59.750
<v Speaker 3>basically his last that history to </v>
<v Speaker 3>modern perception.</v>

1013
00:52:00.500 --> 00:52:03.260
<v Speaker 3>But now once we understand that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1014
00:52:03.261 --> 00:52:08.261
<v Speaker 3>you know what the uniformitarians were </v>
<v Speaker 3>wrong to reject all ideas of </v>

1015
00:52:08.261 --> 00:52:09.680
<v Speaker 3>catastrophism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1016
00:52:09.950 --> 00:52:13.100
<v Speaker 3>because in the original,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the early days of geology,</v>

1017
00:52:13.101 --> 00:52:15.470
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the founding fathers of geology,</v>

1018
00:52:15.560 --> 00:52:19.580
<v Speaker 3>we're catastrophists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They went out in the field unencumbered,</v>

1019
00:52:19.610 --> 00:52:24.260
<v Speaker 3>unencumbered,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unencumbered by dogmas and doctrines.</v>

1020
00:52:24.261 --> 00:52:27.380
<v Speaker 3>And so forth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they looked at the evidence in the field</v>

1021
00:52:27.530 --> 00:52:30.500
<v Speaker 3>and concluded that there had been </v>
<v Speaker 3>catastrophic episodes.</v>

1022
00:52:30.560 --> 00:52:34.820
<v Speaker 3>And this is a baron von qva,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sedgwick murchison,</v>

1023
00:52:34.821 --> 00:52:39.821
<v Speaker 3>if you'd go back and you're all of these</v>
<v Speaker 3>guys who basically are considered the </v>

1024
00:52:39.821 --> 00:52:42.590
<v Speaker 3>godfathers of modern geology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were to a man catastrophist,</v>

1025
00:52:43.620 --> 00:52:45.650
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>james hutton,</v>

1026
00:52:46.160 --> 00:52:51.160
<v Speaker 3>lyle and play fair came along and </v>
<v Speaker 3>basically proposed the idea of </v>

1027
00:52:51.160 --> 00:52:52.670
<v Speaker 3>uniformitarianism.</v>

1028
00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:56.450
<v Speaker 3>The present is the key to the past.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Very powerful.</v>

1029
00:52:56.720 --> 00:53:01.460
<v Speaker 3>A working idea is that we can look at </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff that's going on today,</v>

1030
00:53:01.580 --> 00:53:06.580
<v Speaker 3>extrapolate backwards and try to figure </v>
<v Speaker 3>out things that happened in the past </v>

1031
00:53:06.580 --> 00:53:08.060
<v Speaker 3>when we don't have an eyewitness </v>
<v Speaker 3>account.</v>

1032
00:53:08.061 --> 00:53:10.160
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Very powerful.</v>

1033
00:53:10.161 --> 00:53:15.161
<v Speaker 3>But what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what happened was it became so </v>

1034
00:53:15.161 --> 00:53:17.861
<v Speaker 3>entrenched as dogma that anybody who </v>
<v Speaker 3>invoked catastrophes was considered,</v>

1035
00:53:18.450 --> 00:53:20.330
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>basically fringe.</v>

1036
00:53:20.331 --> 00:53:24.140
<v Speaker 3>Because in the early days,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of these guys like sedgwick,</v>

1037
00:53:24.141 --> 00:53:25.710
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was a theologian.</v>

1038
00:53:25.711 --> 00:53:30.711
<v Speaker 3>He was a traveling minister who went </v>
<v Speaker 3>around and in his travels to convert </v>

1039
00:53:30.841 --> 00:53:32.470
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the people to,</v>

1040
00:53:32.650 --> 00:53:36.150
<v Speaker 3>to christianity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he would see the stuff and he would,</v>

1041
00:53:36.510 --> 00:53:41.510
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>place it within the context perhaps of </v>

1042
00:53:41.510 --> 00:53:41.520
<v Speaker 3>being noah's flood,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1043
00:53:42.030 --> 00:53:44.310
<v Speaker 3>And they would place it in some of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not all of them,</v>

1044
00:53:44.311 --> 00:53:47.250
<v Speaker 3>some of them would place it in a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a biblical context.</v>

1045
00:53:47.251 --> 00:53:50.490
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when they were attacked,</v>

1046
00:53:50.790 --> 00:53:53.970
<v Speaker 3>basically the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the substance of the attack was,</v>

1047
00:53:54.330 --> 00:53:59.330
<v Speaker 3>well you guys are trying to bring us </v>
<v Speaker 3>back to the days of biblical literalism </v>

1048
00:53:59.330 --> 00:53:59.330
<v Speaker 3>in sciences.</v>

1049
00:53:59.330 --> 00:54:00.780
<v Speaker 3>Moved beyond that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're not here,</v>

1050
00:54:00.781 --> 00:54:04.140
<v Speaker 3>we don't want to talk about catastrophes</v>
<v Speaker 3>or great floods.</v>

1051
00:54:04.150 --> 00:54:06.540
<v Speaker 3>Dahlias weren't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're through talking about all of that.</v>

1052
00:54:06.630 --> 00:54:10.500
<v Speaker 3>That's all been discredited.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what you see is between the early 18</v>

1053
00:54:10.501 --> 00:54:14.790
<v Speaker 3>hundreds with the beginning of geology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>earth science too,</v>

1054
00:54:14.791 --> 00:54:17.700
<v Speaker 3>about the 19th century,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you see as a steady decline,</v>

1055
00:54:18.100 --> 00:54:20.010
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of the older guys die off,</v>

1056
00:54:20.011 --> 00:54:25.011
<v Speaker 3>they're replaced by the new guys who </v>
<v Speaker 3>have now basically taken control of the </v>

1057
00:54:25.011 --> 00:54:28.881
<v Speaker 3>university curriculums.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they been indoctrinated into this </v>

1058
00:54:28.881 --> 00:54:32.211
<v Speaker 3>idea of a strict gradUalism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And at any deviation from that strict </v>

1059
00:54:32.211 --> 00:54:34.650
<v Speaker 3>gradualism is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is a heresy basically.</v>

1060
00:54:35.190 --> 00:54:37.470
<v Speaker 3>So by the time we get to the 20th </v>
<v Speaker 3>century,</v>

1061
00:54:37.560 --> 00:54:42.560
<v Speaker 3>you had this raining uniformity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>raining gradualists dogma that had been </v>

1062
00:54:43.051 --> 00:54:48.051
<v Speaker 3>imposed upon all earth science.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And anybody who deviated from that was </v>

1063
00:54:48.051 --> 00:54:52.311
<v Speaker 3>immediately kicked out of the club.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is why when jay harlan brett's </v>

1064
00:54:52.311 --> 00:54:56.930
<v Speaker 3>came along in the 19 twenties and </v>
<v Speaker 3>proposed that there had been these </v>

1065
00:54:56.930 --> 00:54:57.060
<v Speaker 3>gigantic floods in the pacific </v>
<v Speaker 3>northwest,</v>

1066
00:54:57.980 --> 00:55:01.120
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the geological community basically said,</v>

1067
00:55:01.470 --> 00:55:02.130
<v Speaker 3>get outta here.</v>

1068
00:55:02.160 --> 00:55:07.160
<v Speaker 3>We don't want to hear aBout it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We know that that couldn't have been </v>

1069
00:55:07.160 --> 00:55:10.970
<v Speaker 3>just because we know jay harlan brett's </v>
<v Speaker 3>continued to document,</v>

1070
00:55:12.150 --> 00:55:14.620
<v Speaker 3>exhaustively document from the field </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1071
00:55:14.770 --> 00:55:18.180
<v Speaker 3>that these floods were very real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His critics said,</v>

1072
00:55:18.181 --> 00:55:19.050
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't,</v>

1073
00:55:19.080 --> 00:55:21.120
<v Speaker 3>you can't provide a source for these </v>
<v Speaker 3>floods.</v>

1074
00:55:21.210 --> 00:55:22.980
<v Speaker 3>Therefore they didn't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

1075
00:55:22.981 --> 00:55:27.981
<v Speaker 3>bear in mind that all of his critics is </v>
<v Speaker 3>his most vocal critics had never even </v>

1076
00:55:27.981 --> 00:55:32.631
<v Speaker 3>gone out to actually look right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And a gram is going to hit.</v>

1077
00:55:32.900 --> 00:55:36.890
<v Speaker 3>It's got a great section in his new </v>
<v Speaker 3>upcoming book describing the,</v>

1078
00:55:36.960 --> 00:55:41.040
<v Speaker 3>the ordeal that brett's was put through.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he finally prevailed of ultimately,</v>

1079
00:55:41.390 --> 00:55:44.010
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most of his critics died off,</v>

1080
00:55:44.190 --> 00:55:45.420
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he outlived and he lived to be,</v>

1081
00:55:45.421 --> 00:55:48.030
<v Speaker 3>I think 98.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think when he was 96,</v>

1082
00:55:48.031 --> 00:55:53.031
<v Speaker 3>he was given the penrose metal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is the highest honor of geology </v>

1083
00:55:53.031 --> 00:55:54.450
<v Speaker 3>and the only,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he said he was very grateful,</v>

1084
00:55:54.451 --> 00:55:58.240
<v Speaker 3>but the only thing he he was unhappy </v>
<v Speaker 3>about was the fact that he,</v>

1085
00:55:58.440 --> 00:55:59.790
<v Speaker 3>all of his critics had died off.</v>

1086
00:55:59.790 --> 00:56:02.060
<v Speaker 3>So he didn't get to gloat over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

1087
00:56:02.970 --> 00:56:03.570
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1088
00:56:04.470 --> 00:56:08.070
<v Speaker 3>but so What happened was you had the </v>
<v Speaker 3>younger geologists come in who are,</v>

1089
00:56:08.071 --> 00:56:10.860
<v Speaker 3>who are more open to that in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in what you see is between the fifth,</v>

1090
00:56:10.861 --> 00:56:12.600
<v Speaker 3>19,</v>
<v Speaker 3>15 and 19 sixties.</v>

1091
00:56:13.080 --> 00:56:15.030
<v Speaker 3>You have a transition going on where </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>

1092
00:56:15.140 --> 00:56:19.140
<v Speaker 3>where they're beginning to accept that </v>
<v Speaker 3>these great floods that happened.</v>

1093
00:56:19.490 --> 00:56:23.040
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what they did was they took a modern</v>

1094
00:56:23.350 --> 00:56:27.040
<v Speaker 3>example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is glacial outburst floods,</v>

1095
00:56:27.310 --> 00:56:32.310
<v Speaker 3>which we've witnessed dozens and dozens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably hundreds of suitcases in </v>

1096
00:56:32.441 --> 00:56:34.660
<v Speaker 3>Iceland,</v>
<v Speaker 3>particularly Alaska,</v>

1097
00:56:34.661 --> 00:56:39.661
<v Speaker 3>british columbia of the himalayas where </v>
<v Speaker 3>you have particularly going back to the </v>

1098
00:56:39.661 --> 00:56:42.310
<v Speaker 3>little ice age.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When the glaciers began to recede in the</v>

1099
00:56:42.311 --> 00:56:47.311
<v Speaker 3>mid 19th century,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you had a lot of what are called pro </v>

1100
00:56:47.311 --> 00:56:50.070
<v Speaker 3>glacial lakes formed or lakes bodies of </v>
<v Speaker 3>water held in by the melting ice.</v>

1101
00:56:50.890 --> 00:56:53.860
<v Speaker 3>And then eventually the ice gave way </v>
<v Speaker 3>into the water,</v>

1102
00:56:53.861 --> 00:56:55.540
<v Speaker 3>rushed out in the form of a flood.</v>

1103
00:56:55.540 --> 00:56:58.570
<v Speaker 3>The icelanders call it a yoke elopes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

1104
00:56:58.900 --> 00:57:03.900
<v Speaker 3>so we have a modern example.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what they did was in the sixties and </v>

1105
00:57:03.900 --> 00:57:05.320
<v Speaker 3>seventies was they said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1106
00:57:05.380 --> 00:57:10.380
<v Speaker 3>guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've got now evidence that there was a </v>

1107
00:57:10.380 --> 00:57:11.200
<v Speaker 3>huge body of water,</v>
<v Speaker 3>huge lake in western Montana,</v>

1108
00:57:11.680 --> 00:57:16.680
<v Speaker 3>and it was held in by an ice dam.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That ice dam gave way all of this water </v>

1109
00:57:16.680 --> 00:57:20.140
<v Speaker 3>gushed out over Idaho and in </v>
<v Speaker 3>southeastern Washington down to columbia</v>

1110
00:57:20.141 --> 00:57:23.190
<v Speaker 3>gorge to the pacific ocean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and caused all of these,</v>

1111
00:57:23.260 --> 00:57:28.260
<v Speaker 3>this amazing erosion and sedimentation </v>
<v Speaker 3>that harland brett's was documenting.</v>

1112
00:57:30.200 --> 00:57:35.170
<v Speaker 3>Never mind that we have to extrapolate </v>
<v Speaker 3>up three orders of magnitude from modern</v>

1113
00:57:35.171 --> 00:57:36.550
<v Speaker 3>examples,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1114
00:57:36.610 --> 00:57:41.610
<v Speaker 3>Nevermind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the modern examples are utterly </v>

1115
00:57:41.610 --> 00:57:42.040
<v Speaker 3>minuscule compared to what brett's was </v>
<v Speaker 3>looking at.</v>

1116
00:57:42.460 --> 00:57:47.460
<v Speaker 3>That has become the dogma to explain </v>
<v Speaker 3>these floods and it's still the </v>

1117
00:57:47.801 --> 00:57:52.710
<v Speaker 3>entrenched dogma as we speak.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now I am trying to demolish that dogma.</v>

1118
00:57:52.840 --> 00:57:57.840
<v Speaker 3>I want to show that these floods were </v>
<v Speaker 3>something much grander than they have </v>

1119
00:57:58.061 --> 00:58:03.061
<v Speaker 3>even imagined,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that the source of him was not </v>

1120
00:58:03.061 --> 00:58:03.880
<v Speaker 3>actually a big glacial lake,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but was,</v>

1121
00:58:03.940 --> 00:58:08.940
<v Speaker 3>was what brett's originally originally </v>
<v Speaker 3>theorized was that there was something </v>

1122
00:58:08.940 --> 00:58:12.820
<v Speaker 3>that caused a rapid melting of the ice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then his critics said,</v>

1123
00:58:12.821 --> 00:58:17.821
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's nothing that could melt the ice </v>

1124
00:58:17.821 --> 00:58:17.821
<v Speaker 3>as fast as you're requiring for your </v>
<v Speaker 3>floods.</v>

1125
00:58:17.821 --> 00:58:19.180
<v Speaker 3>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your floods didn't happen,</v>

1126
00:58:19.690 --> 00:58:24.690
<v Speaker 3>but his floods did happen and they were </v>
<v Speaker 3>on an enormous inconceivably vast scale.</v>

1127
00:58:25.420 --> 00:58:30.420
<v Speaker 3>And this is what I was taking him out to</v>
<v Speaker 3>see firsthand because I felt like for </v>

1128
00:58:30.420 --> 00:58:34.420
<v Speaker 3>him to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to really have a handle on this,</v>

1129
00:58:34.590 --> 00:58:36.530
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this information and this,</v>

1130
00:58:36.531 --> 00:58:41.531
<v Speaker 3>this insight into the catastrophes that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that basically would have terminated his</v>

1131
00:58:42.010 --> 00:58:47.010
<v Speaker 3>mother civilization as he called it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that he should see this stuff in the </v>

1132
00:58:47.010 --> 00:58:47.010
<v Speaker 3>field for himself.</v>

1133
00:58:47.010 --> 00:58:47.420
<v Speaker 3>Because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1134
00:58:47.460 --> 00:58:50.260
<v Speaker 3>as they say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a picture's worth a thousand words.</v>

1135
00:58:50.410 --> 00:58:55.410
<v Speaker 3>We're going out in the field and </v>
<v Speaker 3>experiencing this directly is worth a </v>

1136
00:58:55.410 --> 00:58:55.410
<v Speaker 3>thousand pictures.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1137
00:58:55.430 --> 00:58:58.270
<v Speaker 3>and so he's going to incorporate that </v>
<v Speaker 3>into his,</v>

1138
00:58:58.360 --> 00:59:01.060
<v Speaker 3>into his book.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I would like to say about that book,</v>

1139
00:59:01.061 --> 00:59:06.061
<v Speaker 3>that that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>based upon what I know and what you've </v>

1140
00:59:06.061 --> 00:59:08.180
<v Speaker 3>shown me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a bit of what's going into the book I'll</v>

1141
00:59:08.310 --> 00:59:12.580
<v Speaker 3>I'll proclaim without any equivocation </v>
<v Speaker 3>that I think is probably going to be the</v>

1142
00:59:12.581 --> 00:59:17.581
<v Speaker 3>most important book that's come out in a</v>
<v Speaker 3>21st century because it's opening a </v>

1143
00:59:17.581 --> 00:59:21.811
<v Speaker 3>window onto this story,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like no other single source of </v>

1144
00:59:21.811 --> 00:59:22.280
<v Speaker 3>information.</v>
<v Speaker 3>CredIble information.</v>

1145
00:59:22.430 --> 00:59:23.840
<v Speaker 3>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a big.</v>

1146
00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:25.140
<v Speaker 3>It's a big statement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This,</v>

1147
00:59:25.160 --> 00:59:30.160
<v Speaker 3>this whole thing is so mind blowing and </v>
<v Speaker 3>as mind blowing as your first </v>

1148
00:59:30.160 --> 00:59:31.640
<v Speaker 3>appearances.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This chart especially is really freaking</v>

1149
00:59:31.641 --> 00:59:33.320
<v Speaker 3>me out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like looking at the mortality,</v>

1150
00:59:33.321 --> 00:59:35.690
<v Speaker 3>all the animals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the mass extinction event that must have</v>

1151
00:59:35.691 --> 00:59:36.410
<v Speaker 3>taken place.</v>

1152
00:59:37.010 --> 00:59:42.010
<v Speaker 3>One of the things that always bothered </v>
<v Speaker 3>me about that idea that human beIngs </v>

1153
00:59:42.010 --> 00:59:45.041
<v Speaker 3>killed off the wooly mammoths is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they found these vast fields of uneaten </v>

1154
00:59:45.081 --> 00:59:50.081
<v Speaker 3>mammoths where there was thousands of </v>
<v Speaker 3>them that had died almost </v>

1155
00:59:50.081 --> 00:59:51.320
<v Speaker 3>instantaneously,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is just.</v>

1156
00:59:51.321 --> 00:59:53.210
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what did they do?</v>

1157
00:59:53.211 --> 00:59:58.211
<v Speaker 3>They went on a mass killing orgy of </v>
<v Speaker 3>slaughter and then just decided not to </v>

1158
00:59:58.851 --> 01:00:00.590
<v Speaker 3>eat any of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1159
01:00:00.650 --> 01:00:05.650
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the field evidence itself is </v>

1160
01:00:05.650 --> 01:00:05.650
<v Speaker 3>inconsistent with that idea right here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is an example.</v>

1161
01:00:05.650 --> 01:00:10.541
<v Speaker 3>This is one of the many mammoth </v>
<v Speaker 3>cemeteries and and what happens is that </v>

1162
01:00:10.940 --> 01:00:13.610
<v Speaker 3>you can see here that you can see from </v>
<v Speaker 3>the shoreline seated,</v>

1163
01:00:13.640 --> 01:00:17.540
<v Speaker 3>there was a flood,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the river rose up to this level,</v>

1164
01:00:17.840 --> 01:00:20.960
<v Speaker 3>and then when it rolls down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it left this in its wake.</v>

1165
01:00:21.290 --> 01:00:26.290
<v Speaker 3>And what you see here like this is bone </v>
<v Speaker 3>counting at the barrel mammoth cemetery </v>

1166
01:00:26.290 --> 01:00:27.530
<v Speaker 3>in northern yakutia siberia.</v>

1167
01:00:28.100 --> 01:00:33.100
<v Speaker 3>Identical deposits are found throughout </v>
<v Speaker 3>the tamer peninsula in what we see here </v>

1168
01:00:33.100 --> 01:00:37.390
<v Speaker 3>is these massive bone deposits that have</v>
<v Speaker 3>been showing up for the last couple of </v>

1169
01:00:37.390 --> 01:00:42.041
<v Speaker 3>hundred years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every time that there's a thawing or a </v>

1170
01:00:42.041 --> 01:00:45.710
<v Speaker 3>flood or these things are washed up on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the shore of the arctic ocean.</v>

1171
01:00:46.080 --> 01:00:47.960
<v Speaker 3>You know what we see is that there were </v>
<v Speaker 3>huge,</v>

1172
01:00:48.020 --> 01:00:53.020
<v Speaker 3>huge herds of wooly mammoths grazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're now the plant material is only two</v>

1173
01:00:55.071 --> 01:00:58.700
<v Speaker 3>inches high.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So clearly it was a completely different</v>

1174
01:00:58.701 --> 01:01:00.200
<v Speaker 3>climate there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1175
01:01:00.440 --> 01:01:04.190
<v Speaker 3>what's interesting is that you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you had in siberia able to support herds</v>

1176
01:01:04.191 --> 01:01:09.191
<v Speaker 3>of wooly mammoths at the same time that </v>
<v Speaker 3>half of north America is buried under </v>

1177
01:01:10.131 --> 01:01:13.790
<v Speaker 3>two miles or more advice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How is that possible?</v>

1178
01:01:13.850 --> 01:01:16.790
<v Speaker 3>Just a totally different atmosphere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Still puzzling over that.</v>

1179
01:01:16.820 --> 01:01:21.820
<v Speaker 3>I have some ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but until I can test these ideas a </v>

1180
01:01:21.820 --> 01:01:21.820
<v Speaker 3>little further.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1181
01:01:21.820 --> 01:01:26.470
<v Speaker 3>so without an ice core samples,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it impossible to figure out what the </v>

1182
01:01:26.470 --> 01:01:28.870
<v Speaker 3>temperature was in siberia at that time?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1183
01:01:28.900 --> 01:01:33.900
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They configure out basically based upon </v>

1184
01:01:33.900 --> 01:01:36.191
<v Speaker 3>fossil plant remains.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you can see that in some cases the </v>

1185
01:01:36.191 --> 01:01:38.210
<v Speaker 3>tree line was hundreds of miles further </v>
<v Speaker 3>north than it is now.</v>

1186
01:01:38.390 --> 01:01:40.400
<v Speaker 3>An ex.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Clearly if you've got trees,</v>

1187
01:01:40.430 --> 01:01:45.200
<v Speaker 3>forests growing now were 13 or 14 or </v>
<v Speaker 3>15,000</v>

1188
01:01:45.201 --> 01:01:46.490
<v Speaker 3>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was permafrost,</v>

1189
01:01:46.550 --> 01:01:48.830
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was warmer clearly.</v>

1190
01:01:51.290 --> 01:01:52.610
<v Speaker 3>So there's still.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>

1191
01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:57.880
<v Speaker 3>What does that 19th century scene </v>
<v Speaker 3>showing every floor of the london docks </v>

1192
01:01:57.880 --> 01:01:59.480
<v Speaker 3>covered by thousands of mammoth tusks </v>
<v Speaker 3>from siberia.</v>

1193
01:01:59.481 --> 01:02:03.710
<v Speaker 3>This is a drawing obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pre dates,</v>

1194
01:02:03.890 --> 01:02:05.000
<v Speaker 3>photographs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1195
01:02:05.210 --> 01:02:10.070
<v Speaker 3>For hundreds of years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thousands of mammas in tombed,</v>

1196
01:02:10.071 --> 01:02:14.750
<v Speaker 3>mammoth and mammoth tusks were being </v>
<v Speaker 3>zoomed from the siberian permafrost.</v>

1197
01:02:15.260 --> 01:02:18.020
<v Speaker 3>Thousands and thousands and thousands of</v>
<v Speaker 3>these.</v>

1198
01:02:18.470 --> 01:02:20.370
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and basically</v>

1199
01:02:20.790 --> 01:02:21.990
<v Speaker 4>to me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you look at this,</v>

1200
01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:26.970
<v Speaker 4>this is just in your face evidence that </v>
<v Speaker 4>this was not humans doing this,</v>

1201
01:02:27.620 --> 01:02:29.170
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was not humans that were,</v>

1202
01:02:29.171 --> 01:02:33.450
<v Speaker 4>were slaughtering these mammas and </v>
<v Speaker 4>burying near remains it,</v>

1203
01:02:33.590 --> 01:02:36.120
<v Speaker 4>it the instantaneous nature would </v>
<v Speaker 4>almost.</v>

1204
01:02:36.490 --> 01:02:39.120
<v Speaker 4>It would almost be like people have </v>
<v Speaker 4>figured out some new thing,</v>

1205
01:02:39.430 --> 01:02:42.120
<v Speaker 4>like they figured out some,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some like,</v>

1206
01:02:42.121 --> 01:02:43.530
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a doom gun,</v>

1207
01:02:43.650 --> 01:02:47.010
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where they shot the whole,</v>

1208
01:02:47.390 --> 01:02:49.280
<v Speaker 4>the doom got well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look at,</v>

1209
01:02:49.310 --> 01:02:51.720
<v Speaker 4>look at the near extinction of american </v>
<v Speaker 4>bison.</v>

1210
01:02:52.020 --> 01:02:56.520
<v Speaker 4>What brought that about trains and high </v>
<v Speaker 4>powered rifles,</v>

1211
01:02:56.730 --> 01:02:59.190
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was a technological major,</v>

1212
01:02:59.191 --> 01:03:03.990
<v Speaker 4>technological advancement that was able </v>
<v Speaker 4>to bring about the near extermination of</v>

1213
01:03:03.991 --> 01:03:06.210
<v Speaker 4>the american,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially a guy that I'm going to bring</v>

1214
01:03:06.211 --> 01:03:09.300
<v Speaker 4>on the podcast soon to discuss that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>As name's dan flores,</v>

1215
01:03:09.301 --> 01:03:14.301
<v Speaker 4>who spent a big chunk of his </v>
<v Speaker 4>intellectual career studying this.</v>

1216
01:03:15.420 --> 01:03:20.420
<v Speaker 4>And what he believes is that the bison </v>
<v Speaker 4>had a massive population jump that was </v>

1217
01:03:22.861 --> 01:03:26.550
<v Speaker 4>directly correlating to smallpox </v>
<v Speaker 4>epidemic.</v>

1218
01:03:26.930 --> 01:03:30.900
<v Speaker 4>The native american people and that when</v>
<v Speaker 4>the United States,</v>

1219
01:03:31.590 --> 01:03:36.590
<v Speaker 4>when we look at the United States </v>
<v Speaker 4>history in the big stacks of woolly </v>

1220
01:03:36.590 --> 01:03:36.590
<v Speaker 4>mammoths,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or excuse me,</v>

1221
01:03:36.590 --> 01:03:41.301
<v Speaker 4>the big stacks of bison skulls,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we always look to like that was a very </v>

1222
01:03:41.301 --> 01:03:45.681
<v Speaker 4>unusual population of bison that existed</v>
<v Speaker 4>because the plains indians had </v>

1223
01:03:45.961 --> 01:03:50.961
<v Speaker 4>experienced this massive extinction </v>
<v Speaker 4>event and then when they had </v>

1224
01:03:50.961 --> 01:03:53.310
<v Speaker 4>incorporated the horse like the horse </v>
<v Speaker 4>and the.</v>

1225
01:03:53.520 --> 01:03:58.520
<v Speaker 4>Apparently the american indians,</v>
<v Speaker 4>native americans rather were on their </v>

1226
01:03:58.520 --> 01:04:00.960
<v Speaker 4>way to extra padding the bison even </v>
<v Speaker 4>before we came along.</v>

1227
01:04:01.170 --> 01:04:06.170
<v Speaker 4>But then they died off in this massive </v>
<v Speaker 4>death scenario with small pox and all </v>

1228
01:04:08.431 --> 01:04:11.640
<v Speaker 4>the different diseases that the </v>
<v Speaker 4>europeans had brought over here.</v>

1229
01:04:12.150 --> 01:04:14.730
<v Speaker 4>And then the mammoth population,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or excuse me,</v>

1230
01:04:14.731 --> 01:04:18.240
<v Speaker 4>the bison population had grown like </v>
<v Speaker 4>almost unnaturally.</v>

1231
01:04:18.241 --> 01:04:23.241
<v Speaker 4>It'd been much larger than it ever been </v>
<v Speaker 4>in the past and that's when the United </v>

1232
01:04:23.910 --> 01:04:28.910
<v Speaker 4>States was established and that's when </v>
<v Speaker 4>all the western european immigrants had </v>

1233
01:04:28.910 --> 01:04:31.830
<v Speaker 4>come along and started killing off all </v>
<v Speaker 4>these bisons.</v>

1234
01:04:32.130 --> 01:04:35.700
<v Speaker 4>It's really a very interesting subject </v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's an interesting idea.</v>

1235
01:04:36.090 --> 01:04:39.120
<v Speaker 4>It's plausible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I haven't looked into that.</v>

1236
01:04:40.010 --> 01:04:41.140
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1237
01:04:41.220 --> 01:04:43.500
<v Speaker 4>I just assumed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and maybe maybe wrongfully,</v>

1238
01:04:43.501 --> 01:04:47.700
<v Speaker 4>but I had assumed that the bison </v>
<v Speaker 4>population had been relatively stable.</v>

1239
01:04:48.150 --> 01:04:50.170
<v Speaker 4>I am not convinced though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

1240
01:04:50.680 --> 01:04:55.680
<v Speaker 4>that there was this massive die off of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the native american population yet I'm </v>

1241
01:04:55.680 --> 01:04:56.940
<v Speaker 4>not convinced maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1242
01:04:56.941 --> 01:04:58.580
<v Speaker 4>because I haven't looked into it yet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

1243
01:04:58.810 --> 01:05:03.810
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the things I've seen is that the </v>

1244
01:05:03.810 --> 01:05:06.681
<v Speaker 4>assumption there is predicated upon the </v>
<v Speaker 4>europeans arrived and brought the </v>

1245
01:05:06.681 --> 01:05:06.681
<v Speaker 4>diseases that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

1246
01:05:06.681 --> 01:05:10.900
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that native americans had no defenses </v>

1247
01:05:10.900 --> 01:05:10.900
<v Speaker 4>for.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the thing is,</v>

1248
01:05:10.900 --> 01:05:11.250
<v Speaker 4>is that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1249
01:05:11.251 --> 01:05:16.251
<v Speaker 4>there's so much evidence now showing </v>
<v Speaker 4>that there were lots of explorers in </v>

1250
01:05:17.531 --> 01:05:18.130
<v Speaker 4>immigrants</v>

1251
01:05:18.610 --> 01:05:22.090
<v Speaker 3>to the new world prior to the arrival of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the europeans.</v>

1252
01:05:22.450 --> 01:05:24.040
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the chinese,</v>

1253
01:05:24.041 --> 01:05:29.041
<v Speaker 3>the phoenicians.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm not necessarily saying that's </v>

1254
01:05:29.041 --> 01:05:31.260
<v Speaker 3>credible that none of it's been proven.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there's some interesting data out </v>

1255
01:05:31.260 --> 01:05:33.640
<v Speaker 3>there that suggests in there a number of</v>
<v Speaker 3>books written that again,</v>

1256
01:05:33.641 --> 01:05:38.641
<v Speaker 3>I haven't accessed it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm not gonna sit here and pretend </v>

1257
01:05:38.641 --> 01:05:38.890
<v Speaker 3>that I'm an authority on that because </v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not.</v>

1258
01:05:38.920 --> 01:05:43.920
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if some of that turns out to be </v>

1259
01:05:43.920 --> 01:05:45.991
<v Speaker 3>credible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it would suggest that there was a lot </v>

1260
01:05:45.991 --> 01:05:48.481
<v Speaker 3>more interaction between the native </v>
<v Speaker 3>american population and other groups </v>

1261
01:05:48.481 --> 01:05:49.120
<v Speaker 3>around the world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which,</v>

1262
01:05:49.180 --> 01:05:54.180
<v Speaker 3>if true to me kind of somewhat </v>
<v Speaker 3>undermines this idea that they were,</v>

1263
01:05:55.890 --> 01:06:00.890
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>completely susceptible to the </v>

1264
01:06:00.890 --> 01:06:01.250
<v Speaker 3>introduction of these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1265
01:06:01.440 --> 01:06:03.550
<v Speaker 3>to these foreign diseases.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But again,</v>

1266
01:06:03.940 --> 01:06:05.560
<v Speaker 3>I will,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got an open mind.</v>

1267
01:06:05.561 --> 01:06:07.360
<v Speaker 3>I'll wait and see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd like to see what his,</v>

1268
01:06:07.480 --> 01:06:09.340
<v Speaker 3>what he says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd like to hear his,</v>

1269
01:06:09.730 --> 01:06:10.260
<v Speaker 3>his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1270
01:06:11.230 --> 01:06:11.570
<v Speaker 3>his idea</v>

1271
01:06:11.760 --> 01:06:16.760
<v Speaker 4>for anyone interested in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He has a paper in the journal of </v>

1272
01:06:16.760 --> 01:06:20.091
<v Speaker 4>american history.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's called bison ecology and bison </v>

1273
01:06:20.091 --> 01:06:23.961
<v Speaker 4>diplomacy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The southern plains from 1800 to 1850.</v>

1274
01:06:24.630 --> 01:06:26.610
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just looked for it online.</v>

1275
01:06:26.640 --> 01:06:28.920
<v Speaker 4>You can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a preview that's available,</v>

1276
01:06:28.921 --> 01:06:31.650
<v Speaker 4>but to download the entire paper or </v>
<v Speaker 4>book,</v>

1277
01:06:31.750 --> 01:06:34.350
<v Speaker 4>I'm not sure which one it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's $19.</v>

1278
01:06:34.650 --> 01:06:39.650
<v Speaker 4>And what's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what journal is it in the journal of </v>

1279
01:06:39.650 --> 01:06:41.850
<v Speaker 4>american history from september of </v>
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] 91.</v>

1280
01:06:42.240 --> 01:06:45.600
<v Speaker 4>And like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's working on a new book right now and</v>

1281
01:06:45.601 --> 01:06:47.280
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm trying to get them to come in,</v>

1282
01:06:47.281 --> 01:06:52.281
<v Speaker 4>but it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's very difficult while he's in the </v>

1283
01:06:52.281 --> 01:06:52.281
<v Speaker 4>middle of a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you said september of 1991.</v>

1284
01:06:52.281 --> 01:06:52.710
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1285
01:06:52.711 --> 01:06:55.920
<v Speaker 4>I can probably access dan flores is his </v>
<v Speaker 4>name.</v>

1286
01:06:55.980 --> 01:07:00.980
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well just the information that I got </v>

1287
01:07:00.980 --> 01:07:03.090
<v Speaker 4>about it was pretty mind blowing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but a sounds interesting.</v>

1288
01:07:03.091 --> 01:07:06.300
<v Speaker 4>I want to know more.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thank you for that.</v>

1289
01:07:06.301 --> 01:07:07.050
<v Speaker 4>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>please.</v>

1290
01:07:07.530 --> 01:07:12.530
<v Speaker 4>Now let's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's go back to that photo that you </v>

1291
01:07:12.530 --> 01:07:13.410
<v Speaker 4>have on your desktop that you were going</v>
<v Speaker 4>to explain to me,</v>

1292
01:07:13.411 --> 01:07:18.411
<v Speaker 4>but we decided not to talk about it </v>
<v Speaker 4>before the podcast because it's so </v>

1293
01:07:18.411 --> 01:07:22.371
<v Speaker 4>incredible that you said this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All this incredible change that we're </v>

1294
01:07:23.521 --> 01:07:24.940
<v Speaker 4>looking at the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1295
01:07:24.941 --> 01:07:29.941
<v Speaker 4>the geological structure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all that took place within just a week.</v>

1296
01:07:31.010 --> 01:07:33.050
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's go to.</v>

1297
01:07:33.051 --> 01:07:33.950
<v Speaker 3>This will,</v>
<v Speaker 3>will come.</v>

1298
01:07:34.010 --> 01:07:38.810
<v Speaker 3>I've got that world will come to that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a,</v>

1299
01:07:40.010 --> 01:07:43.040
<v Speaker 3>this is a satellite photograph taken </v>
<v Speaker 3>from about 500 miles up.</v>

1300
01:07:43.820 --> 01:07:46.100
<v Speaker 3>And what you see here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is southeastern Washington,</v>

1301
01:07:46.580 --> 01:07:51.580
<v Speaker 3>and what you're looking at here is part </v>
<v Speaker 3>of what's called the columbia basalt </v>

1302
01:07:51.580 --> 01:07:54.290
<v Speaker 3>plateau.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is part of the terrain that,</v>

1303
01:07:54.430 --> 01:07:59.430
<v Speaker 3>that we crossed when I was with graham.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What you see here is that you have an </v>

1304
01:07:59.481 --> 01:08:01.790
<v Speaker 3>area of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you look here,</v>

1305
01:08:01.791 --> 01:08:02.950
<v Speaker 3>you can see the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1306
01:08:03.530 --> 01:08:08.530
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>differentiate between the pixels in the </v>

1307
01:08:08.530 --> 01:08:12.281
<v Speaker 3>actual squares that like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you see this red area down here is area </v>

1308
01:08:12.281 --> 01:08:15.980
<v Speaker 3>that's actually being farmed and it's an</v>
<v Speaker 3>in because this is an photograph.</v>

1309
01:08:15.981 --> 01:08:20.981
<v Speaker 3>And so what happens is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that the areas that are being </v>

1310
01:08:20.981 --> 01:08:22.580
<v Speaker 3>cultivated will show up warmer than the </v>
<v Speaker 3>surrounding areas.</v>

1311
01:08:23.060 --> 01:08:28.060
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this whole plateau is covered in this </v>

1312
01:08:28.060 --> 01:08:30.191
<v Speaker 3>stuff called los l o e s s,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's a type of very fertile soil </v>

1313
01:08:31.690 --> 01:08:34.820
<v Speaker 3>that has a rather mysterious and </v>
<v Speaker 3>controversial origin.</v>

1314
01:08:34.900 --> 01:08:37.010
<v Speaker 3>We'll get into that right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in some places,</v>

1315
01:08:37.011 --> 01:08:39.110
<v Speaker 3>this last layer is hundreds of feet </v>
<v Speaker 3>thIck,</v>

1316
01:08:39.350 --> 01:08:43.580
<v Speaker 3>over a dark basalt bedrock that is the </v>
<v Speaker 3>result of,</v>

1317
01:08:43.940 --> 01:08:47.240
<v Speaker 3>of these massive outflows of basaltic </v>
<v Speaker 3>lava,</v>

1318
01:08:47.750 --> 01:08:48.600
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1319
01:08:48.660 --> 01:08:53.660
<v Speaker 3>that came out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did extruded between about $6 million </v>

1320
01:08:53.660 --> 01:08:54.590
<v Speaker 3>and 16 million years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1321
01:08:55.910 --> 01:08:57.260
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the hotspot,</v>

1322
01:08:57.261 --> 01:09:02.261
<v Speaker 3>that was the ultimate origin of this </v>
<v Speaker 3>basalt is now we're yellowstone is </v>

1323
01:09:02.261 --> 01:09:03.620
<v Speaker 3>which,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you can make that connection near the</v>

1324
01:09:03.621 --> 01:09:06.530
<v Speaker 3>yellowstone super volcano.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Super volcano.</v>

1325
01:09:06.531 --> 01:09:07.160
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1326
01:09:07.230 --> 01:09:08.020
<v Speaker 3>In,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

1327
01:09:08.350 --> 01:09:13.350
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what you have here is that you have </v>

1328
01:09:13.350 --> 01:09:17.591
<v Speaker 3>the lighter areas is where this lust </v>
<v Speaker 3>topsoil still exists and the darker </v>

1329
01:09:17.591 --> 01:09:18.420
<v Speaker 3>areas is where the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1330
01:09:18.480 --> 01:09:23.480
<v Speaker 3>the underlying dark basalt has been,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is showing through because the loss was </v>

1331
01:09:23.480 --> 01:09:25.350
<v Speaker 3>washed away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what this is,</v>

1332
01:09:25.351 --> 01:09:26.660
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is your typical,</v>

1333
01:09:26.850 --> 01:09:31.850
<v Speaker 3>the geological term is and nasda </v>
<v Speaker 3>moseying and basically that means a </v>

1334
01:09:31.850 --> 01:09:36.011
<v Speaker 3>branching flow pattern of the water and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you can see that very clearly here that </v>

1335
01:09:37.011 --> 01:09:42.011
<v Speaker 3>the water came off of this river,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is the columbia river up here and </v>

1336
01:09:42.011 --> 01:09:46.271
<v Speaker 3>float over the landscape and washed away</v>
<v Speaker 3>the basalt and left these gigantic </v>

1337
01:09:47.841 --> 01:09:50.660
<v Speaker 3>channels in its wake and there's more </v>
<v Speaker 3>over here to the,</v>

1338
01:09:50.690 --> 01:09:53.060
<v Speaker 3>to the east and there's more over here </v>
<v Speaker 3>to the west.</v>

1339
01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:58.550
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and if we look at actually this,</v>

1340
01:09:59.390 --> 01:10:04.390
<v Speaker 3>let me go to a different program here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that will actually have some </v>

1341
01:10:05.180 --> 01:10:09.800
<v Speaker 3>that actually I think has the picture in</v>
<v Speaker 3>it that you were seeing.</v>

1342
01:10:10.970 --> 01:10:13.730
<v Speaker 3>Now what we're looking at here is what's</v>
<v Speaker 3>been called the missoula flood,</v>

1343
01:10:14.140 --> 01:10:15.830
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Named after the town of missoula,</v>

1344
01:10:15.831 --> 01:10:20.831
<v Speaker 3>Montana.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Missoula is in a basin that was part of </v>

1345
01:10:20.831 --> 01:10:24.581
<v Speaker 3>this hypothesized giant lake that that </v>
<v Speaker 3>presumably caused this flood.</v>

1346
01:10:25.040 --> 01:10:26.690
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And again,</v>

1347
01:10:26.691 --> 01:10:29.330
<v Speaker 3>there was an ice dam that there was this</v>
<v Speaker 3>ice dam,</v>

1348
01:10:29.360 --> 01:10:32.480
<v Speaker 3>the ice dam broke and as soon as this </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing comes up,</v>

1349
01:10:32.481 --> 01:10:35.510
<v Speaker 3>I will be able to show you some slides.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here we go.</v>

1350
01:10:35.511 --> 01:10:37.970
<v Speaker 3>Let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>here we go.</v>

1351
01:10:37.971 --> 01:10:41.900
<v Speaker 3>It's becoming operate here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>While that's coming up,</v>

1352
01:10:42.230 --> 01:10:45.920
<v Speaker 3>we'll look at this slide right here </v>
<v Speaker 3>because this will kind of give you a,</v>

1353
01:10:46.530 --> 01:10:51.530
<v Speaker 3>a picture of the earth as it was during </v>
<v Speaker 3>the height of the ice age.</v>

1354
01:10:56.750 --> 01:10:58.190
<v Speaker 3>So wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's pretty deep.</v>

1355
01:10:58.320 --> 01:11:01.910
<v Speaker 3>The sheets of ice go pretty far down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's amazing.</v>

1356
01:11:01.911 --> 01:11:04.220
<v Speaker 3>Canada didn't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Candidate in exist.</v>

1357
01:11:04.280 --> 01:11:05.750
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1358
01:11:05.900 --> 01:11:08.900
<v Speaker 3>Poor canadians.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well yeah.</v>

1359
01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:11.390
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

1360
01:11:11.570 --> 01:11:13.440
<v Speaker 3>the ice part of it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1361
01:11:13.441 --> 01:11:18.441
<v Speaker 3>a lot of that in the midwest now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of the farming belt of America is </v>

1362
01:11:18.441 --> 01:11:23.361
<v Speaker 3>basically growing out of the fertile </v>
<v Speaker 3>soil that the ice scraped off of Canada </v>

1363
01:11:23.361 --> 01:11:27.210
<v Speaker 3>and dumped down in Minnesota and Iowa </v>
<v Speaker 3>and Wisconsin and so on.</v>

1364
01:11:27.211 --> 01:11:28.470
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1365
01:11:28.710 --> 01:11:30.660
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some day they may want that back,</v>

1366
01:11:31.910 --> 01:11:36.170
<v Speaker 3>but we're not going to let him have it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fascinating when you look at that,</v>

1367
01:11:36.320 --> 01:11:40.290
<v Speaker 3>that there was this big ice cap,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then the areas around it,</v>

1368
01:11:40.680 --> 01:11:43.500
<v Speaker 3>no ice and why,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why was that?</v>

1369
01:11:44.580 --> 01:11:46.050
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's one of the mysteries,</v>

1370
01:11:46.170 --> 01:11:51.170
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like over here in siberia can see over </v>

1371
01:11:51.170 --> 01:11:53.841
<v Speaker 3>here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is where all the woolly mammoths </v>

1372
01:11:53.841 --> 01:11:53.841
<v Speaker 3>were.</v>

1373
01:11:53.841 --> 01:11:56.270
<v Speaker 3>Giant herds of bully mammoths and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>appears lIke it may have been warmer </v>

1374
01:11:56.370 --> 01:11:59.490
<v Speaker 3>than now during the ice age,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is very odd.</v>

1375
01:11:59.700 --> 01:12:01.860
<v Speaker 3>There's some ice up there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that what we're seeing?</v>

1376
01:12:01.861 --> 01:12:03.210
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's some ice up there.</v>

1377
01:12:04.050 --> 01:12:09.050
<v Speaker 3>Sporadic glaciers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but nothing like what we see in </v>

1378
01:12:09.050 --> 01:12:10.830
<v Speaker 3>northwestern europe over here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This was called the pheno scandi and ice</v>

1379
01:12:10.840 --> 01:12:15.840
<v Speaker 3>sheet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the sheet over north America </v>

1380
01:12:15.840 --> 01:12:16.920
<v Speaker 3>actually consisted of two ice sheets,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the lauren laurentide,</v>

1381
01:12:17.280 --> 01:12:20.030
<v Speaker 3>which was centered over hudson bay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and record the aaron,</v>

1382
01:12:20.050 --> 01:12:22.080
<v Speaker 3>which was centered over the canadian </v>
<v Speaker 3>rockies.</v>

1383
01:12:22.560 --> 01:12:26.660
<v Speaker 3>And in this particular slide you can see</v>
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

1384
01:12:27.900 --> 01:12:32.900
<v Speaker 3>you can see here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this was the core of the aaron over </v>

1385
01:12:32.900 --> 01:12:32.900
<v Speaker 3>here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>over the canadian rockies,</v>

1386
01:12:32.900 --> 01:12:35.400
<v Speaker 3>and this was the law,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the laurentide was much bigger c,</v>

1387
01:12:35.770 --> 01:12:39.060
<v Speaker 3>and then there was an area between the </v>
<v Speaker 3>two right here,</v>

1388
01:12:39.600 --> 01:12:42.090
<v Speaker 3>which has been theorized as a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at one point,</v>

1389
01:12:42.091 --> 01:12:47.091
<v Speaker 3>having been a corridor called the </v>
<v Speaker 3>icefree corridor in migrants from </v>

1390
01:12:47.390 --> 01:12:52.390
<v Speaker 3>paleoindian.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Migrants from siberia would have come </v>

1391
01:12:52.390 --> 01:12:55.941
<v Speaker 3>across Alaska and down through this </v>
<v Speaker 3>corridor here to the lower United States</v>

1392
01:12:56.430 --> 01:13:00.300
<v Speaker 3>and ultimately down here to south </v>
<v Speaker 3>America.</v>

1393
01:13:00.840 --> 01:13:05.840
<v Speaker 3>And it was that group,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these groups of bands of paleo indian </v>

1394
01:13:05.840 --> 01:13:10.540
<v Speaker 3>hunters that according to the overkill </v>
<v Speaker 3>or blitzkrieg hypothesis wiped out the,</v>

1395
01:13:10.640 --> 01:13:11.180
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1396
01:13:11.270 --> 01:13:14.220
<v Speaker 3>the mega mammals as they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as they passed by.</v>

1397
01:13:18.130 --> 01:13:18.930
<v Speaker 5>It's just.</v>

1398
01:13:21.970 --> 01:13:22.920
<v Speaker 3>Let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

1399
01:13:22.921 --> 01:13:23.880
<v Speaker 3>there we go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1400
01:13:23.881 --> 01:13:26.000
<v Speaker 3>So here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this will show,</v>

1401
01:13:26.540 --> 01:13:30.450
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the coastlines of the,</v>

1402
01:13:30.610 --> 01:13:33.750
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the world during the,</v>

1403
01:13:33.751 --> 01:13:35.280
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>during the ice age.</v>

1404
01:13:35.910 --> 01:13:40.910
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me just escape out of this so that </v>

1405
01:13:42.661 --> 01:13:46.770
<v Speaker 3>we can zoom in a little bit and look at </v>
<v Speaker 3>it closer.</v>

1406
01:13:47.970 --> 01:13:51.180
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So here would be,</v>

1407
01:13:53.490 --> 01:13:55.200
<v Speaker 3>as we see now,</v>

1408
01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:57.400
<v Speaker 5>and</v>

1409
01:13:57.610 --> 01:14:00.130
<v Speaker 3>this is modern coastline,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is modern coastlines.</v>

1410
01:14:00.160 --> 01:14:01.870
<v Speaker 3>And now I'm going to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to jump to.</v>

1411
01:14:02.200 --> 01:14:07.200
<v Speaker 3>This is actually only 300 feet lower </v>
<v Speaker 3>than now and quite a bit different.</v>

1412
01:14:10.220 --> 01:14:12.280
<v Speaker 3>let's just look at the United States.</v>

1413
01:14:12.820 --> 01:14:14.740
<v Speaker 1>North America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's amazinG.</v>

1414
01:14:15.200 --> 01:14:17.210
<v Speaker 1>It was a lot more United States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1415
01:14:17.300 --> 01:14:18.610
<v Speaker 1>Now check this out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1416
01:14:18.910 --> 01:14:21.730
<v Speaker 1>Now here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's north America city is now,</v>

1417
01:14:21.760 --> 01:14:23.980
<v Speaker 1>and you see up here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what's called,</v>

1418
01:14:25.030 --> 01:14:28.870
<v Speaker 1>this is the bering strait right here in </v>
<v Speaker 1>between Alaska and siberia,</v>

1419
01:14:28.990 --> 01:14:33.990
<v Speaker 1>right during the ice age.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This whole area was exposed it because </v>

1420
01:14:36.401 --> 01:14:41.401
<v Speaker 1>of the lowered sea level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we'll go one slide further and you </v>

1421
01:14:41.401 --> 01:14:41.401
<v Speaker 1>will see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take a look.</v>

1422
01:14:41.401 --> 01:14:41.401
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>watch what happens up there.</v>

1423
01:14:41.401 --> 01:14:43.840
<v Speaker 1>And Bahrain jia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Boom.</v>

1424
01:14:43.930 --> 01:14:45.370
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's all land.</v>

1425
01:14:45.400 --> 01:14:48.550
<v Speaker 1>It's all land and it's connecting north </v>
<v Speaker 1>America to siberia.</v>

1426
01:14:48.670 --> 01:14:50.920
<v Speaker 1>And that's all drowned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Last didn't understand that.</v>

1427
01:14:50.921 --> 01:14:55.921
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always thought that the bering strait </v>

1428
01:14:55.921 --> 01:14:55.921
<v Speaker 1>was an ice mass that thought it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>during the ice age,</v>

1429
01:14:55.921 --> 01:14:59.020
<v Speaker 1>that there was some sort of us that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was ice,</v>

1430
01:14:59.050 --> 01:15:00.130
<v Speaker 1>but it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's land.</v>

1431
01:15:00.190 --> 01:15:01.330
<v Speaker 1>It's land.</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>

1432
01:15:01.690 --> 01:15:03.040
<v Speaker 1>and it's not glaciated.</v>

1433
01:15:03.460 --> 01:15:08.460
<v Speaker 1>And it was home to these extraordinary </v>
<v Speaker 1>herds of mega mammals that ranged over </v>

1434
01:15:10.451 --> 01:15:12.580
<v Speaker 1>these thousands and thousands of square </v>
<v Speaker 1>miles.</v>

1435
01:15:12.581 --> 01:15:15.190
<v Speaker 1>I mean the drowned areas bigger than </v>
<v Speaker 1>modern Alaska.</v>

1436
01:15:15.340 --> 01:15:17.140
<v Speaker 1>So how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how long ago was this?</v>

1437
01:15:17.350 --> 01:15:18.140
<v Speaker 1>When this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1438
01:15:18.220 --> 01:15:20.170
<v Speaker 1>right at the end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>up until the end of the ice age,</v>

1439
01:15:20.470 --> 01:15:21.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>between like 14,</v>

1440
01:15:21.881 --> 01:15:23.120
<v Speaker 1>15,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago,</v>

1441
01:15:23.121 --> 01:15:24.010
<v Speaker 1>14,</v>
<v Speaker 1>50,000</v>

1442
01:15:24.011 --> 01:15:25.780
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Know glacIers in this area.</v>

1443
01:15:25.781 --> 01:15:30.781
<v Speaker 1>This is all just land and there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>animals living in it and people are </v>

1444
01:15:30.781 --> 01:15:30.781
<v Speaker 1>walking back and forth is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1445
01:15:30.781 --> 01:15:33.640
<v Speaker 1>essentially it was a continent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was connected.</v>

1446
01:15:33.710 --> 01:15:36.070
<v Speaker 1>There was all one continent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was all one.</v>

1447
01:15:36.130 --> 01:15:38.320
<v Speaker 1>It was all one continent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1448
01:15:38.321 --> 01:15:43.000
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the coastlines of the world.</v>

1449
01:15:43.001 --> 01:15:45.320
<v Speaker 1>Look at Florida down here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

1450
01:15:45.400 --> 01:15:48.070
<v Speaker 1>it's douBle the width of the modern </v>
<v Speaker 1>peninsula.</v>

1451
01:15:48.250 --> 01:15:53.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's enormous and it's so close to </v>

1452
01:15:53.250 --> 01:15:54.100
<v Speaker 1>Mexico too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like a little boat ride.</v>

1453
01:15:54.790 --> 01:15:57.450
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here is Indonesia and you know,</v>

1454
01:15:57.460 --> 01:15:59.050
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're stories,</v>

1455
01:15:59.170 --> 01:16:00.610
<v Speaker 1>which I don't know how credible they </v>
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>

1456
01:16:00.611 --> 01:16:05.611
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are stories like memoria and the </v>

1457
01:16:05.611 --> 01:16:05.611
<v Speaker 1>pacific and all of them.</v>

1458
01:16:05.611 --> 01:16:05.611
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

1459
01:16:05.611 --> 01:16:06.040
<v Speaker 1>a credible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are.</v>

1460
01:16:06.041 --> 01:16:08.740
<v Speaker 1>I think the atlanta story actually has a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little more credibility.</v>

1461
01:16:08.741 --> 01:16:13.741
<v Speaker 1>We talked about that last time somewhat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but here's the modern and you can see </v>

1462
01:16:13.741 --> 01:16:13.741
<v Speaker 1>the light.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Blue is the,</v>

1463
01:16:13.741 --> 01:16:17.620
<v Speaker 1>is the coastal shelf area right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's go back drop.</v>

1464
01:16:17.621 --> 01:16:22.621
<v Speaker 1>We're going to drop sea level 300 feet </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you'll see here the enormous </v>

1465
01:16:22.621 --> 01:16:23.830
<v Speaker 1>change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

1466
01:16:24.010 --> 01:16:29.010
<v Speaker 1>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>enormous areas of land were drowned by </v>

1467
01:16:29.010 --> 01:16:30.820
<v Speaker 1>the rising sea levels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember this now,</v>

1468
01:16:30.821 --> 01:16:34.120
<v Speaker 1>when we look at the rise of modern </v>
<v Speaker 1>cities and modern civilizations,</v>

1469
01:16:34.121 --> 01:16:37.060
<v Speaker 1>where did they first show up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to coast to coast,</v>

1470
01:16:37.090 --> 01:16:39.480
<v Speaker 1>right at the mouths of rivers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the coastlines,</v>

1471
01:16:39.970 --> 01:16:43.450
<v Speaker 1>and in during the ice age,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where would have been the most obvious?</v>

1472
01:16:43.810 --> 01:16:48.810
<v Speaker 1>Prime,</v>
<v Speaker 1>habitable real estate down close to sea </v>

1473
01:16:48.810 --> 01:16:48.810
<v Speaker 1>level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1474
01:16:48.810 --> 01:16:50.590
<v Speaker 1>So if there were cities built,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1475
01:16:50.591 --> 01:16:53.140
<v Speaker 1>if they were thriving communities during</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ice age,</v>

1476
01:16:53.141 --> 01:16:58.141
<v Speaker 1>there are now 400 feet under the water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so amazing that all of these </v>

1477
01:16:58.141 --> 01:17:01.780
<v Speaker 1>stories of floods,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the epic of gilgamesh,</v>

1478
01:17:01.810 --> 01:17:03.130
<v Speaker 1>noah's ark.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1479
01:17:03.400 --> 01:17:08.400
<v Speaker 1>They all have these stories seem to </v>
<v Speaker 1>really correlate with,</v>

1480
01:17:09.260 --> 01:17:10.190
<v Speaker 1>with all this data.</v>

1481
01:17:10.190 --> 01:17:12.350
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they all seemed to coincide.</v>

1482
01:17:12.530 --> 01:17:15.710
<v Speaker 3>That's exactly the point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so weird.</v>

1483
01:17:16.790 --> 01:17:17.390
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1484
01:17:17.391 --> 01:17:19.410
<v Speaker 3>most people would think about the story </v>
<v Speaker 3>of noah's ark.</v>

1485
01:17:19.710 --> 01:17:21.800
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just crazy old horse shit,</v>

1486
01:17:22.130 --> 01:17:27.130
<v Speaker 3>but it's most likely this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're basing it on something that </v>

1487
01:17:27.130 --> 01:17:31.280
<v Speaker 3>happened very rapidly in their area.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1488
01:17:31.730 --> 01:17:34.040
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course we were most familiar with the</v>

1489
01:17:34.041 --> 01:17:35.530
<v Speaker 3>story of noah's ark,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1490
01:17:35.540 --> 01:17:37.310
<v Speaker 3>because of the judeo christian </v>
<v Speaker 3>tradition.</v>

1491
01:17:37.340 --> 01:17:42.340
<v Speaker 3>But there are hundreds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>literally hundreds of stories from all </v>

1492
01:17:42.340 --> 01:17:43.930
<v Speaker 3>over the world that parallels the story </v>
<v Speaker 3>of noah.</v>

1493
01:17:43.931 --> 01:17:46.740
<v Speaker 3>One yard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You kaylene thrusts the,</v>

1494
01:17:46.750 --> 01:17:51.750
<v Speaker 3>pitched them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man knew that list goes on and on of </v>

1495
01:17:51.750 --> 01:17:55.481
<v Speaker 3>these culture heroes that somehow had </v>
<v Speaker 3>for knowledge of this impending </v>

1496
01:17:55.481 --> 01:17:59.120
<v Speaker 3>disaster.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we're able To take steps to preserve</v>

1497
01:17:59.121 --> 01:18:00.470
<v Speaker 3>themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their family,</v>

1498
01:18:01.160 --> 01:18:04.820
<v Speaker 3>some diverse cross section of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of species.</v>

1499
01:18:05.350 --> 01:18:06.680
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which,</v>

1500
01:18:06.681 --> 01:18:11.681
<v Speaker 3>and they all have this similarity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They all parallel now my way of looking </v>

1501
01:18:12.261 --> 01:18:12.890
<v Speaker 3>at it as this.</v>

1502
01:18:12.890 --> 01:18:17.890
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we now know from the hard geological </v>

1503
01:18:17.890 --> 01:18:20.480
<v Speaker 3>record that massive floods have taken </v>
<v Speaker 3>place on the surface of the earth,</v>

1504
01:18:20.570 --> 01:18:25.570
<v Speaker 3>massive floods,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right beyond anything that we have even </v>

1505
01:18:25.570 --> 01:18:27.860
<v Speaker 3>imagined right up until a decade or few </v>
<v Speaker 3>decades ago.</v>

1506
01:18:28.490 --> 01:18:30.680
<v Speaker 3>They're real okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>On the other hand,</v>

1507
01:18:30.950 --> 01:18:34.220
<v Speaker 3>we have stories and myths and legends </v>
<v Speaker 3>repeatedly.</v>

1508
01:18:34.221 --> 01:18:39.221
<v Speaker 3>It's probably the most ubiquitous of all</v>
<v Speaker 3>the stories that we've inherited from </v>

1509
01:18:39.221 --> 01:18:43.571
<v Speaker 3>the past is this story of this gigantic </v>
<v Speaker 3>world destroying flood that occurred </v>

1510
01:18:43.571 --> 01:18:48.550
<v Speaker 3>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>On one hand we have the geological hard </v>

1511
01:18:48.550 --> 01:18:49.880
<v Speaker 3>geological record,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which shows there were giant floods.</v>

1512
01:18:50.120 --> 01:18:55.120
<v Speaker 3>Then we have these epIc tales and myths </v>
<v Speaker 3>from all over the world about giant </v>

1513
01:18:55.120 --> 01:18:57.440
<v Speaker 3>floods.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do we now dismissed those flood,</v>

1514
01:18:57.470 --> 01:18:59.240
<v Speaker 3>those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those stories out of hand and say,</v>

1515
01:18:59.241 --> 01:19:02.000
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's just superstitious preliterate,</v>

1516
01:19:02.520 --> 01:19:04.550
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pseudoscientific nonsense.</v>

1517
01:19:05.870 --> 01:19:07.850
<v Speaker 3>I think we'd be making a big mistake to </v>
<v Speaker 3>do that.</v>

1518
01:19:08.360 --> 01:19:13.360
<v Speaker 3>Now if we accept that those flood </v>
<v Speaker 3>stories and maybe they have been altered</v>

1519
01:19:14.451 --> 01:19:19.010
<v Speaker 3>through time and through the telling </v>
<v Speaker 3>represent something real.</v>

1520
01:19:19.670 --> 01:19:22.730
<v Speaker 3>What about the other other elements of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the story,</v>

1521
01:19:22.731 --> 01:19:27.500
<v Speaker 3>the fact that in so many cases there was</v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody that had for knowledge,</v>

1522
01:19:28.400 --> 01:19:31.100
<v Speaker 3>do we dismiss that out of hand as well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1523
01:19:31.101 --> 01:19:34.640
<v Speaker 3>or where does that come from?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That there was one group of people,</v>

1524
01:19:34.641 --> 01:19:39.641
<v Speaker 3>small group of people that saw this </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing coming and prepared for it and </v>

1525
01:19:39.641 --> 01:19:43.670
<v Speaker 3>others who basically paid no attention.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe they would just preppers.</v>

1526
01:19:43.710 --> 01:19:45.980
<v Speaker 3>Maybe there's the prep for 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago.</v>

1527
01:19:45.981 --> 01:19:50.981
<v Speaker 3>Preppers have 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years on those tv shows that explains </v>

1528
01:19:50.981 --> 01:19:50.981
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1529
01:19:50.981 --> 01:19:53.180
<v Speaker 3>The one last slide quick here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's,</v>

1530
01:19:53.181 --> 01:19:56.600
<v Speaker 3>here's europe and look at the british </v>
<v Speaker 3>isles right now.</v>

1531
01:19:56.601 --> 01:20:00.380
<v Speaker 3>We'll drop sea level.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No british isles.</v>

1532
01:20:00.470 --> 01:20:02.000
<v Speaker 3>That's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>

1533
01:20:02.001 --> 01:20:05.840
<v Speaker 3>that's what I was saying earlier when we</v>
<v Speaker 3>started talking to the world of 15,000</v>

1534
01:20:05.841 --> 01:20:10.530
<v Speaker 3>years ago was so dramatically different </v>
<v Speaker 3>than our modern world that,</v>

1535
01:20:10.560 --> 01:20:11.430
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1536
01:20:11.440 --> 01:20:15.810
<v Speaker 3>it's almost difficult to conceive until </v>
<v Speaker 3>you start looking at things like this.</v>

1537
01:20:16.020 --> 01:20:18.360
<v Speaker 3>and this is all during the ice age.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1538
01:20:18.570 --> 01:20:22.350
<v Speaker 3>And so the melting of the glaciers just </v>
<v Speaker 3>changed everything.</v>

1539
01:20:22.390 --> 01:20:26.070
<v Speaker 3>Every thought process while human beings</v>
<v Speaker 3>were absolutely alive.</v>

1540
01:20:26.071 --> 01:20:27.030
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>absolutely,</v>

1541
01:20:27.060 --> 01:20:30.630
<v Speaker 3>absolutely no question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The human human beings were alive.</v>

1542
01:20:30.631 --> 01:20:32.130
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

1543
01:20:32.970 --> 01:20:35.820
<v Speaker 3>so we'll start looking at some of these </v>
<v Speaker 3>pictures here.</v>

1544
01:20:35.821 --> 01:20:39.420
<v Speaker 3>This is from western Montana.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know it says in genesis seven,</v>

1545
01:20:39.421 --> 01:20:44.421
<v Speaker 3>19,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the waters prevailed exceedingly upon </v>

1546
01:20:44.421 --> 01:20:44.421
<v Speaker 3>the earth and all the high hills </v>
<v Speaker 3>recovered.</v>

1547
01:20:44.530 --> 01:20:48.690
<v Speaker 3>We want you to take a look.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As you can see many mountains in western</v>

1548
01:20:48.691 --> 01:20:53.691
<v Speaker 3>United States.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you know what you're looking at that </v>

1549
01:20:53.691 --> 01:20:54.690
<v Speaker 3>have this on them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what those are,</v>

1550
01:20:54.750 --> 01:20:59.750
<v Speaker 3>those horizontal lines they look like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like where the shore there shoreline </v>

1551
01:20:59.750 --> 01:21:01.830
<v Speaker 3>exactly their shorelines.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's absolutely what they are.</v>

1552
01:21:01.860 --> 01:21:06.860
<v Speaker 3>That's absolutely what they are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Their shorelines reaching right up to </v>

1553
01:21:06.860 --> 01:21:06.870
<v Speaker 3>the very tops of the hills.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You see,</v>

1554
01:21:07.140 --> 01:21:12.140
<v Speaker 3>and basically what you had was you had </v>
<v Speaker 3>this enormous gush of water filling </v>

1555
01:21:13.261 --> 01:21:18.261
<v Speaker 3>these mountain valleys almost to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>mountain peaks and then draining away </v>

1556
01:21:18.261 --> 01:21:22.550
<v Speaker 3>and as it drained away,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it left the succession of shorelines </v>

1557
01:21:22.550 --> 01:21:26.600
<v Speaker 3>etched into the hillside and all along </v>
<v Speaker 3>the pathway of the floods,</v>

1558
01:21:30.211 --> 01:21:31.620
<v Speaker 3>we're going to see stuff like this.</v>

1559
01:21:32.160 --> 01:21:35.220
<v Speaker 3>This right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This was our first stop with graham.</v>

1560
01:21:35.430 --> 01:21:39.900
<v Speaker 3>This is a lot to ral falls.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is that basalt I was talking about.</v>

1561
01:21:40.050 --> 01:21:45.050
<v Speaker 3>Look at this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's layers of this basalt or that's </v>

1562
01:21:45.050 --> 01:21:45.820
<v Speaker 3>you guys underneath it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1563
01:21:46.220 --> 01:21:51.220
<v Speaker 3>I don't think in despair.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I took this picture about 10 </v>

1564
01:21:51.220 --> 01:21:51.220
<v Speaker 3>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>

1565
01:21:51.220 --> 01:21:52.140
<v Speaker 3>I have pictures of me and graham under </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

1566
01:21:52.250 --> 01:21:53.340
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're so tiny.</v>

1567
01:21:53.460 --> 01:21:56.310
<v Speaker 3>That's so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so big right now.</v>

1568
01:21:56.460 --> 01:21:59.550
<v Speaker 3>Here's what you've got to picture joe </v>
<v Speaker 3>picture.</v>

1569
01:21:59.551 --> 01:22:03.690
<v Speaker 3>You've got this nice gentle valley with </v>
<v Speaker 3>a nice river,</v>

1570
01:22:03.870 --> 01:22:05.270
<v Speaker 3>very pastoral scene.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1571
01:22:05.340 --> 01:22:10.340
<v Speaker 3>trees and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Probably mamasan herds of animals </v>

1572
01:22:10.500 --> 01:22:15.240
<v Speaker 3>grazing along the side of this peaceful </v>
<v Speaker 3>river with gentle chatt valley slopes.</v>

1573
01:22:16.350 --> 01:22:20.990
<v Speaker 3>Here comes this massive flood and we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about perhaps a flood wave 800,</v>

1574
01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:24.900
<v Speaker 3>1000 feet hIgh coming through as it </v>
<v Speaker 3>comes through.</v>

1575
01:22:24.901 --> 01:22:27.600
<v Speaker 3>It's ripping up everything in its path </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it,</v>

1576
01:22:27.630 --> 01:22:32.630
<v Speaker 3>what it does is it now changes the </v>
<v Speaker 3>profile of his valley from this gentle </v>

1577
01:22:32.630 --> 01:22:36.060
<v Speaker 3>profile to downcutting 800,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a thousand,</v>

1578
01:22:36.061 --> 01:22:39.390
<v Speaker 3>1200 feet or more into the bedrock.</v>

1579
01:22:39.570 --> 01:22:44.570
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So now prior to the passage of this </v>

1580
01:22:44.570 --> 01:22:47.871
<v Speaker 3>giant flood,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you had streams and nice little rivers </v>

1581
01:22:47.871 --> 01:22:49.350
<v Speaker 3>flowing into the main river,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which in this case was the columbia.</v>

1582
01:22:50.040 --> 01:22:52.650
<v Speaker 3>What happens is after the passage of </v>
<v Speaker 3>this flood wave,</v>

1583
01:22:52.680 --> 01:22:57.450
<v Speaker 3>it sheared off the sides of the channel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the now rather than a gentle slope,</v>

1584
01:22:57.451 --> 01:22:58.760
<v Speaker 3>you've got sheer cliffs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>four,</v>

1585
01:22:58.770 --> 01:23:00.000
<v Speaker 3>five,</v>
<v Speaker 3>600 feet high.</v>

1586
01:23:00.540 --> 01:23:04.890
<v Speaker 3>These pre-flood streams and rivers come </v>
<v Speaker 3>up and are now waterfalls,</v>

1587
01:23:05.230 --> 01:23:07.360
<v Speaker 3>and that's what we're looking at right </v>
<v Speaker 3>here in this picture,</v>

1588
01:23:07.570 --> 01:23:12.570
<v Speaker 3>if that makes sense to you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and and you notice how you've got this </v>

1589
01:23:12.570 --> 01:23:16.741
<v Speaker 3>undercutting here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that undercutting only occurs when you </v>

1590
01:23:16.741 --> 01:23:21.280
<v Speaker 3>have enormous intense turbulence in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>water doIng this.</v>

1591
01:23:22.150 --> 01:23:25.840
<v Speaker 3>You see the water doing this will </v>
<v Speaker 3>undercut.</v>

1592
01:23:26.380 --> 01:23:31.380
<v Speaker 3>See this modern waterfall here had </v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing to do with the creation of this </v>

1593
01:23:32.771 --> 01:23:37.771
<v Speaker 3>cliff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This cliff was cut again probably in a </v>

1594
01:23:37.771 --> 01:23:40.390
<v Speaker 3>matter of days to weeks by the passage </v>
<v Speaker 3>of these jargon floods,</v>

1595
01:23:40.900 --> 01:23:44.470
<v Speaker 3>and there's dozens of these waterfalls </v>
<v Speaker 3>that are left.</v>

1596
01:23:44.500 --> 01:23:46.900
<v Speaker 3>They're called and these are called </v>
<v Speaker 3>hanging valleys.</v>

1597
01:23:47.410 --> 01:23:52.410
<v Speaker 3>They can be produced by glaciers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they can also be produced by </v>

1598
01:23:52.410 --> 01:23:55.990
<v Speaker 3>enormous intense flood waves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is your typical,</v>

1599
01:23:56.280 --> 01:23:57.640
<v Speaker 3>not no appointment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not typical.</v>

1600
01:23:57.820 --> 01:24:00.250
<v Speaker 3>This is called.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a bar.</v>

1601
01:24:00.490 --> 01:24:04.020
<v Speaker 3>I'm a gravel bar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in this case it's a boulder bar.</v>

1602
01:24:04.030 --> 01:24:09.030
<v Speaker 3>And if you've ever done any walking </v>
<v Speaker 3>along a river or a creek or along the </v>

1603
01:24:09.101 --> 01:24:13.390
<v Speaker 3>beach and you've seen ripples in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>sand and they're typically,</v>

1604
01:24:13.830 --> 01:24:18.830
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you've got a water that's a foot or </v>

1605
01:24:18.830 --> 01:24:19.210
<v Speaker 3>two feet deep,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't have ripples that are maybe an</v>

1606
01:24:19.211 --> 01:24:24.211
<v Speaker 3>inch or two high.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What we're looking at here is a flood </v>

1607
01:24:24.211 --> 01:24:28.381
<v Speaker 3>bar that's three miles long.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's up to 250 feet above the modern </v>

1608
01:24:28.661 --> 01:24:33.661
<v Speaker 3>river.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the ripples that you can see here </v>

1609
01:24:33.661 --> 01:24:38.580
<v Speaker 3>are up to 50 feet in height and 350 feet</v>
<v Speaker 3>in wavelength.</v>

1610
01:24:41.860 --> 01:24:45.970
<v Speaker 3>This was produced again by gigantic </v>
<v Speaker 3>flood flows.</v>

1611
01:24:46.450 --> 01:24:51.450
<v Speaker 3>And if we look right over here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a three story building you see </v>

1612
01:24:51.450 --> 01:24:51.980
<v Speaker 3>right there for scale.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1613
01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:53.480
<v Speaker 3>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this,</v>

1614
01:24:53.481 --> 01:24:55.340
<v Speaker 3>this gives you an idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1615
01:24:55.420 --> 01:25:00.420
<v Speaker 3>it's features like this that are just </v>
<v Speaker 3>unequivocal in terms of realizing that </v>

1616
01:25:00.551 --> 01:25:03.280
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is not pseudoscience.</v>

1617
01:25:03.281 --> 01:25:06.430
<v Speaker 3>This really happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is,</v>

1618
01:25:06.460 --> 01:25:09.220
<v Speaker 3>there's this date back to a very </v>
<v Speaker 3>specific time.</v>

1619
01:25:09.280 --> 01:25:12.380
<v Speaker 3>Yes to this 13,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>year.</v>

1620
01:25:12.381 --> 01:25:15.220
<v Speaker 3>So everywhere you're seeing thIs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've seen a.</v>

1621
01:25:15.230 --> 01:25:18.230
<v Speaker 3>Geologically you've seen an ice core as </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're seeing it in fossils.</v>

1622
01:25:18.430 --> 01:25:19.390
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1623
01:25:19.440 --> 01:25:22.090
<v Speaker 3>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is evidence of the big meltdown.</v>

1624
01:25:22.630 --> 01:25:24.490
<v Speaker 3>Has anybody ever tried to debate you on </v>
<v Speaker 3>this stuff?</v>

1625
01:25:25.780 --> 01:25:27.880
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would certainly welcome debate.</v>

1626
01:25:27.910 --> 01:25:30.580
<v Speaker 3>I don't claim to have the final,</v>
<v Speaker 3>final word on this,</v>

1627
01:25:30.581 --> 01:25:31.540
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's the thing.</v>

1628
01:25:31.541 --> 01:25:34.690
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've interacted with a lot of geologists</v>

1629
01:25:34.750 --> 01:25:37.210
<v Speaker 3>that are studying this professional </v>
<v Speaker 3>geologists.</v>

1630
01:25:37.211 --> 01:25:42.211
<v Speaker 3>They're studying this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I can tell you is that in most </v>

1631
01:25:42.211 --> 01:25:42.490
<v Speaker 3>cases,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the geologists that are studying it,</v>

1632
01:25:42.540 --> 01:25:47.540
<v Speaker 3>it's not something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's basically something that you're </v>

1633
01:25:47.540 --> 01:25:47.540
<v Speaker 3>doing in your spare time.</v>

1634
01:25:47.540 --> 01:25:48.510
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most of them are engaged,</v>

1635
01:25:48.530 --> 01:25:49.390
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>either you know,</v>

1636
01:25:49.391 --> 01:25:50.040
<v Speaker 3>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1637
01:25:50.041 --> 01:25:53.920
<v Speaker 3>in energy industry or working for </v>
<v Speaker 3>government for other purposes.</v>

1638
01:25:55.060 --> 01:25:57.640
<v Speaker 3>What you actually will see here though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you being to look at the,</v>

1639
01:25:57.641 --> 01:26:02.641
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the trend in the evidence is that I </v>

1640
01:26:02.641 --> 01:26:04.861
<v Speaker 3>think that the geological community is </v>
<v Speaker 3>moving much closer to a scenario like </v>

1641
01:26:04.861 --> 01:26:09.401
<v Speaker 3>I'm describing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And right now there's actually a </v>

1642
01:26:09.401 --> 01:26:09.401
<v Speaker 3>controversy because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1643
01:26:09.401 --> 01:26:12.350
<v Speaker 3>some of the older guard is wanting to </v>
<v Speaker 3>defend this idea of the old collapse.</v>

1644
01:26:12.351 --> 01:26:16.310
<v Speaker 3>This pro,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this giant lake draining out.</v>

1645
01:26:16.780 --> 01:26:18.980
<v Speaker 3>There are a group of canadian geologists</v>
<v Speaker 3>though,</v>

1646
01:26:18.981 --> 01:26:23.981
<v Speaker 3>who are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who are challenging that under a </v>

1647
01:26:23.981 --> 01:26:25.040
<v Speaker 3>leadership of a man who may now be </v>
<v Speaker 3>retired named John Shaw,</v>

1648
01:26:25.370 --> 01:26:30.370
<v Speaker 3>who goes back to the 19 eighties and </v>
<v Speaker 3>began a reinterpretation of a,</v>

1649
01:26:30.561 --> 01:26:33.750
<v Speaker 3>of a very ubiquitous glacial feature </v>
<v Speaker 3>called [inaudible].</v>

1650
01:26:34.190 --> 01:26:35.040
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1651
01:26:35.140 --> 01:26:38.780
<v Speaker 3>and that we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can show you some pictures of him here</v>

1652
01:26:38.781 --> 01:26:39.420
<v Speaker 3>after a bit there.</v>

1653
01:26:39.430 --> 01:26:40.670
<v Speaker 3>They're very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1654
01:26:41.360 --> 01:26:45.950
<v Speaker 3>they look like inverted bolt holes and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it was assumed and are always associated</v>

1655
01:26:45.951 --> 01:26:50.270
<v Speaker 3>with the locations of the glaciers and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the ice sheets.</v>

1656
01:26:50.630 --> 01:26:55.630
<v Speaker 3>So it was therefore assume that they </v>
<v Speaker 3>were somehow created by the glaciers </v>

1657
01:26:55.630 --> 01:26:59.351
<v Speaker 3>themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but glaciers tend to grind things that </v>

1658
01:26:59.351 --> 01:27:03.011
<v Speaker 3>they're moving over in level things off </v>
<v Speaker 3>and scratch them and leave striations.</v>

1659
01:27:03.441 --> 01:27:07.760
<v Speaker 3>And all of this abrasion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these drum ones are smooth,</v>

1660
01:27:07.790 --> 01:27:12.790
<v Speaker 3>streamlined features.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What shaw first proposed back in the </v>

1661
01:27:13.520 --> 01:27:18.520
<v Speaker 3>late eighties was that they had actually</v>
<v Speaker 3>been produced by water flowing massive </v>

1662
01:27:18.520 --> 01:27:20.630
<v Speaker 3>amounts of water flowing under the </v>
<v Speaker 3>glaciers.</v>

1663
01:27:21.530 --> 01:27:23.050
<v Speaker 3>And there's a very similar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1664
01:27:23.051 --> 01:27:23.340
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1665
01:27:23.341 --> 01:27:24.500
<v Speaker 3>the critics said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1666
01:27:25.010 --> 01:27:26.840
<v Speaker 3>where does this water come from?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he said,</v>

1667
01:27:26.841 --> 01:27:27.230
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don'T know.</v>

1668
01:27:27.231 --> 01:27:30.950
<v Speaker 3>It must have been enormous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>SubglacIal lake subglacial reservoirs.</v>

1669
01:27:31.310 --> 01:27:32.090
<v Speaker 3>The critics said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1670
01:27:32.091 --> 01:27:36.980
<v Speaker 3>there's no way that our reservoir is </v>
<v Speaker 3>huge as your floods would require,</v>

1671
01:27:36.981 --> 01:27:38.330
<v Speaker 3>could have existed under the ice.</v>

1672
01:27:38.660 --> 01:27:43.660
<v Speaker 3>Therefore your subglacial floods didn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>exist and that was the.</v>

1673
01:27:44.030 --> 01:27:49.030
<v Speaker 3>To me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fatal weakness in his theory was to </v>

1674
01:27:49.030 --> 01:27:51.791
<v Speaker 3>explain where the water came from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think now we can't explain where </v>

1675
01:27:51.791 --> 01:27:53.990
<v Speaker 3>it came from and you believe it's an </v>
<v Speaker 3>asteroid impact again,</v>

1676
01:27:54.020 --> 01:27:55.410
<v Speaker 3>by default I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

1677
01:27:55.790 --> 01:27:57.860
<v Speaker 3>we have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we look at all the possible,</v>

1678
01:27:57.861 --> 01:28:01.160
<v Speaker 3>the cross section of possible </v>
<v Speaker 3>explanations within the realm of nature.</v>

1679
01:28:01.550 --> 01:28:03.620
<v Speaker 3>We can go through and we can eliminate </v>
<v Speaker 3>this one,</v>

1680
01:28:03.621 --> 01:28:04.460
<v Speaker 3>this one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this one,</v>

1681
01:28:04.461 --> 01:28:05.180
<v Speaker 3>this one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this one,</v>

1682
01:28:05.181 --> 01:28:10.181
<v Speaker 3>and what we're left with is one that of </v>
<v Speaker 3>itself would be fully capable of doing </v>

1683
01:28:10.181 --> 01:28:12.930
<v Speaker 3>it fully capable and make sense that it </v>
<v Speaker 3>would happen instantaneous.</v>

1684
01:28:12.931 --> 01:28:14.870
<v Speaker 3>That would make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It would happen instantaneously.</v>

1685
01:28:14.890 --> 01:28:16.400
<v Speaker 3>Other sort of thing that would.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1686
01:28:16.610 --> 01:28:20.630
<v Speaker 3>So is there an impact crater that </v>
<v Speaker 3>corresponds to this timeline or.</v>

1687
01:28:20.631 --> 01:28:22.850
<v Speaker 3>That's what I'm working on trying to </v>
<v Speaker 3>find it.</v>

1688
01:28:23.230 --> 01:28:24.170
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think I've.</v>

1689
01:28:24.690 --> 01:28:29.690
<v Speaker 3>I think I've got a pretty good idea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's going to take some field </v>

1690
01:28:29.690 --> 01:28:32.020
<v Speaker 3>research and next summer I'm planning to</v>
<v Speaker 3>do some some more field research.</v>

1691
01:28:32.021 --> 01:28:34.850
<v Speaker 3>Is there an idea where it hit a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1692
01:28:34.851 --> 01:28:39.851
<v Speaker 3>I have several ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't want to talk about it when </v>

1693
01:28:40.100 --> 01:28:41.900
<v Speaker 3>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When it's time to reveal it.</v>

1694
01:28:42.080 --> 01:28:43.250
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's do it here.</v>

1695
01:28:43.370 --> 01:28:44.060
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd love that.</v>

1696
01:28:44.090 --> 01:28:45.370
<v Speaker 3>I would love that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1697
01:28:45.500 --> 01:28:48.410
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've shown several impact craters.</v>

1698
01:28:48.411 --> 01:28:50.090
<v Speaker 3>You showed a bunch last time you were </v>
<v Speaker 3>here,</v>

1699
01:28:50.091 --> 01:28:54.770
<v Speaker 3>the one in Australia that was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe you said 500 years ago.</v>

1700
01:28:55.710 --> 01:28:58.610
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and of course everybody medically,</v>

1701
01:28:58.850 --> 01:29:03.750
<v Speaker 3>it hasn't been proven yet because again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of these more recent craters of the</v>

1702
01:29:03.751 --> 01:29:05.190
<v Speaker 3>last 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years,</v>

1703
01:29:06.240 --> 01:29:11.240
<v Speaker 3>some of these that have been </v>
<v Speaker 3>hypothesized are actually on the bottom </v>

1704
01:29:11.240 --> 01:29:14.091
<v Speaker 3>of the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The trader that I think we talked about </v>

1705
01:29:14.091 --> 01:29:15.260
<v Speaker 3>on the bottom of the indian ocean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's under two miles of seawater,</v>

1706
01:29:15.270 --> 01:29:20.270
<v Speaker 3>so until we can actually get back there </v>
<v Speaker 3>in and do more in depth sampling in </v>

1707
01:29:20.821 --> 01:29:22.920
<v Speaker 3>examination,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it'll be impossible to prove it,</v>

1708
01:29:22.921 --> 01:29:27.921
<v Speaker 3>but I think that the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the evidence is stronGly supportive of </v>

1709
01:29:27.921 --> 01:29:31.620
<v Speaker 3>that possibility that maybe 5,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago there was a significant impact</v>

1710
01:29:31.621 --> 01:29:35.310
<v Speaker 3>into the indian ocean that could have </v>
<v Speaker 3>caused enormous tsunami waves.</v>

1711
01:29:35.310 --> 01:29:37.710
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I actually posted one of the,</v>

1712
01:29:37.870 --> 01:29:42.870
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody called into queStion some of </v>

1713
01:29:42.870 --> 01:29:45.750
<v Speaker 3>the things I had said in the last </v>
<v Speaker 3>interview about tsunamis.</v>

1714
01:29:46.380 --> 01:29:50.070
<v Speaker 3>And at that the things I was saying </v>
<v Speaker 3>weren't really tsunami.</v>

1715
01:29:50.071 --> 01:29:55.071
<v Speaker 3>So I actually wrote an elaborate </v>
<v Speaker 3>response to that which is posted on the </v>

1716
01:29:55.710 --> 01:29:59.400
<v Speaker 3>sacred geometry website where I've gone </v>
<v Speaker 3>into great detail.</v>

1717
01:29:59.770 --> 01:30:04.770
<v Speaker 3>I'm showing that the evidence really in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the end I think does support the idea </v>

1718
01:30:04.770 --> 01:30:09.270
<v Speaker 3>that there had been enormous tsunamis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>possibly hundreds of feet high,</v>

1719
01:30:09.660 --> 01:30:13.410
<v Speaker 3>sweeping over the coastlines of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>indian ocean probably around 5,000</v>

1720
01:30:13.411 --> 01:30:18.411
<v Speaker 3>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That could have been the origin of some </v>

1721
01:30:18.411 --> 01:30:18.411
<v Speaker 3>of the flood myths</v>

1722
01:30:18.650 --> 01:30:23.150
<v Speaker 4>and your timeline where this mass </v>
<v Speaker 4>extinction event occurred,</v>

1723
01:30:23.210 --> 01:30:28.210
<v Speaker 4>where the massive warming occurred.</v>
<v Speaker 4>all of that also coincides with the </v>

1724
01:30:28.641 --> 01:30:33.200
<v Speaker 4>discovery of this nuclear glass all over</v>
<v Speaker 4>asian europe,</v>

1725
01:30:34.040 --> 01:30:39.040
<v Speaker 4>which is somewhere in the when they do </v>
<v Speaker 4>the core samples of around the same </v>

1726
01:30:39.040 --> 01:30:40.250
<v Speaker 4>area,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right around $12,000</v>

1727
01:30:40.550 --> 01:30:41.660
<v Speaker 3>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1728
01:30:42.080 --> 01:30:45.770
<v Speaker 3>We can see here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll go through a second.</v>

1729
01:30:45.771 --> 01:30:48.470
<v Speaker 3>This is some of the research you can </v>
<v Speaker 3>see.</v>

1730
01:30:48.471 --> 01:30:49.850
<v Speaker 3>This is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is very typical,</v>

1731
01:30:51.440 --> 01:30:53.840
<v Speaker 3>the mysterious onset of the younger </v>
<v Speaker 3>dryas.</v>

1732
01:30:54.260 --> 01:30:59.260
<v Speaker 3>Now this is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This has been the kind of the consensus </v>

1733
01:30:59.260 --> 01:30:59.260
<v Speaker 3>view is that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1734
01:30:59.260 --> 01:31:01.100
<v Speaker 3>we don't have an explanation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The younger dryas remembers.</v>

1735
01:31:01.140 --> 01:31:03.320
<v Speaker 3>That's an interval between those two </v>
<v Speaker 3>spikes,</v>

1736
01:31:03.500 --> 01:31:08.500
<v Speaker 3>right where you had the warming than the</v>
<v Speaker 3>snap back to glacial cold and in the </v>

1737
01:31:08.541 --> 01:31:13.541
<v Speaker 3>warming again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that interval in between is the </v>

1738
01:31:13.541 --> 01:31:15.971
<v Speaker 3>younger dryas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So here they're saying the mysterious </v>

1739
01:31:15.971 --> 01:31:19.510
<v Speaker 3>onset of the younger dryas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the 1300 year long younger dryas cold </v>

1740
01:31:19.510 --> 01:31:23.590
<v Speaker 3>reversal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you notice the date's twelve </v>

1741
01:31:23.590 --> 01:31:23.590
<v Speaker 3>thousand nine hundred and eleven </v>
<v Speaker 3>thousand six hundred.</v>

1742
01:31:23.590 --> 01:31:25.730
<v Speaker 3>That means calendar years before </v>
<v Speaker 3>present.</v>

1743
01:31:26.270 --> 01:31:29.510
<v Speaker 3>So what they've done is they've </v>
<v Speaker 3>calibrated this from radio carbon dating</v>

1744
01:31:29.920 --> 01:31:31.820
<v Speaker 3>too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is not necessarily going to be the</v>

1745
01:31:31.821 --> 01:31:36.080
<v Speaker 3>same as the actual calendar years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So those dates are very interesting.</v>

1746
01:31:36.410 --> 01:31:38.600
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>11,000,</v>

1747
01:31:38.601 --> 01:31:41.840
<v Speaker 3>600 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you may recall from our last interview,</v>

1748
01:31:42.230 --> 01:31:45.740
<v Speaker 3>is the date given by plato for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>subsidence of atlantis.</v>

1749
01:31:45.980 --> 01:31:47.090
<v Speaker 3>Eleven thOusand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1750
01:31:47.091 --> 01:31:50.060
<v Speaker 3>he says that atlanta subsided in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can.</v>

1751
01:31:50.120 --> 01:31:55.120
<v Speaker 3>Anybody can read this if they want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>pick up timaeus and critias the two </v>

1752
01:31:55.120 --> 01:31:58.670
<v Speaker 3>dialogues that he describes atlantis and</v>
<v Speaker 3>he gives that date 9,000</v>

1753
01:31:58.671 --> 01:32:00.230
<v Speaker 3>years before the</v>

1754
01:32:00.370 --> 01:32:04.930
<v Speaker 1>exile of long in Egypt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which took place in 600 bc roughly.</v>

1755
01:32:05.350 --> 01:32:09.130
<v Speaker 1>So six huNdred bc in rough roughly is </v>
<v Speaker 1>2,600</v>

1756
01:32:09.131 --> 01:32:11.050
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Add that to the 9,000</v>

1757
01:32:11.051 --> 01:32:12.950
<v Speaker 1>years and years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your $11,600.</v>

1758
01:32:13.360 --> 01:32:16.390
<v Speaker 1>So now what has happened is 2,500</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago,</v>

1759
01:32:16.391 --> 01:32:21.391
<v Speaker 1>plato gave a date,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which would seem to suggest that </v>

1760
01:32:21.391 --> 01:32:21.391
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some something.</v>

1761
01:32:21.391 --> 01:32:25.910
<v Speaker 1>A man's happened in the atlantic ocean </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you had an island complex that sank </v>

1762
01:32:26.170 --> 01:32:30.310
<v Speaker 1>perhaps from rapid sea level rise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now 2,500</v>

1763
01:32:30.311 --> 01:32:32.890
<v Speaker 1>years later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's modern science coming up with the</v>

1764
01:32:32.891 --> 01:32:34.240
<v Speaker 1>exact date showing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1765
01:32:34.241 --> 01:32:37.930
<v Speaker 1>there was a massive meltwater pulse into</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ocean at that date.</v>

1766
01:32:38.740 --> 01:32:43.740
<v Speaker 1>Now at this point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody within mainstream science is </v>

1767
01:32:43.740 --> 01:32:43.740
<v Speaker 1>going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1768
01:32:43.740 --> 01:32:44.010
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see he doesn't mention here.</v>

1769
01:32:44.050 --> 01:32:45.700
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the date given by plato.</v>

1770
01:32:46.300 --> 01:32:48.070
<v Speaker 1>They don't say that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's.</v>

1771
01:32:48.130 --> 01:32:49.930
<v Speaker 1>It is the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's incredible.</v>

1772
01:32:50.890 --> 01:32:51.790
<v Speaker 1>That's so amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

1773
01:32:51.791 --> 01:32:55.210
<v Speaker 1>plato,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he was told that it was all through</v>

1774
01:32:55.211 --> 01:32:55.860
<v Speaker 1>stories.</v>

1775
01:32:55.900 --> 01:32:56.410
<v Speaker 1>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1776
01:32:56.411 --> 01:32:58.480
<v Speaker 1>it was handed down soul on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>handed down.</v>

1777
01:32:58.481 --> 01:33:03.481
<v Speaker 1>Let's see if I can remember this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Through deprived esther pitus to </v>

1778
01:33:03.481 --> 01:33:03.481
<v Speaker 1>courteous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The elder critias,</v>

1779
01:33:03.481 --> 01:33:07.420
<v Speaker 1>the elder to courteous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The younger then critias the younger,</v>

1780
01:33:07.480 --> 01:33:12.480
<v Speaker 1>I guess to socrates actually at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>forum we're plato would have heard it </v>

1781
01:33:12.480 --> 01:33:14.800
<v Speaker 1>would have been the socratic forum where</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was told,</v>

1782
01:33:14.801 --> 01:33:19.300
<v Speaker 1>so I think there was like three </v>
<v Speaker 1>generations between salon in plato,</v>

1783
01:33:19.720 --> 01:33:24.720
<v Speaker 1>the wise men of the time or the people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that were in charge of disseminating </v>

1784
01:33:24.720 --> 01:33:26.170
<v Speaker 1>knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Back then it was such a critical job.</v>

1785
01:33:26.350 --> 01:33:27.350
<v Speaker 1>Critical job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

1786
01:33:27.360 --> 01:33:28.840
<v Speaker 1>no internet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no books and,</v>

1787
01:33:28.841 --> 01:33:29.250
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1788
01:33:29.251 --> 01:33:31.120
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole thing was,</v>

1789
01:33:31.121 --> 01:33:35.080
<v Speaker 1>was that the whole emphasis was on </v>
<v Speaker 1>transmit.</v>

1790
01:33:35.110 --> 01:33:39.700
<v Speaker 1>The oral transmission had to take place </v>
<v Speaker 1>without not one iota of change.</v>

1791
01:33:40.360 --> 01:33:43.180
<v Speaker 1>It had to be transmitted from mouth to </v>
<v Speaker 1>ear,</v>

1792
01:33:44.170 --> 01:33:46.660
<v Speaker 1>unbroken without change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>without alteration,</v>

1793
01:33:46.690 --> 01:33:49.030
<v Speaker 1>which has always been the issue with </v>
<v Speaker 1>human beings.</v>

1794
01:33:49.060 --> 01:33:52.680
<v Speaker 1>Hence that telephone game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You tell someone something,</v>

1795
01:33:52.760 --> 01:33:56.010
<v Speaker 1>they tell you something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you start out in,</v>

1796
01:33:56.020 --> 01:33:59.170
<v Speaker 1>you know it's going to be the same with </v>
<v Speaker 1>native americans and the native american</v>

1797
01:33:59.171 --> 01:34:04.171
<v Speaker 1>storytellers have to go through a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>long arduous term of initiation to show </v>

1798
01:34:05.441 --> 01:34:08.780
<v Speaker 1>that when they tell the story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be exactly like they heard</v>

1799
01:34:08.781 --> 01:34:13.781
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the basis of modern </v>

1800
01:34:13.781 --> 01:34:16.021
<v Speaker 1>freemasonry too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need to get that with today's modern </v>

1801
01:34:16.021 --> 01:34:16.021
<v Speaker 1>gossip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1802
01:34:16.021 --> 01:34:20.480
<v Speaker 1>we need to nail that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but let's just run through a quick </v>

1803
01:34:20.480 --> 01:34:22.921
<v Speaker 1>succession here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If some of the most recent research </v>

1804
01:34:22.921 --> 01:34:25.920
<v Speaker 1>shock synthesized hexagonal diamonds in </v>
<v Speaker 1>younger dryas boundary sediments,</v>

1805
01:34:26.380 --> 01:34:31.380
<v Speaker 1>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now these shocks synthesized hexagonal </v>

1806
01:34:31.380 --> 01:34:33.610
<v Speaker 1>diamonds only occur.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no natural known natural process</v>

1807
01:34:33.611 --> 01:34:38.611
<v Speaker 1>that will produce them except for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>intense heat and pressures of a cosmic </v>

1808
01:34:38.611 --> 01:34:40.270
<v Speaker 1>impact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

1809
01:34:40.720 --> 01:34:42.670
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what year was this study?</v>

1810
01:34:43.180 --> 01:34:44.770
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this has been very recent.</v>

1811
01:34:44.770 --> 01:34:46.960
<v Speaker 1>This is probably within the last 10 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

1812
01:34:47.020 --> 01:34:50.980
<v Speaker 1>there was some since 2007.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is probably around 2011.</v>

1813
01:34:51.610 --> 01:34:56.610
<v Speaker 1>There was something that was released </v>
<v Speaker 1>very recently about micro diamonds and </v>

1814
01:34:56.610 --> 01:34:58.040
<v Speaker 1>micro diamonds correspond summer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1815
01:34:58.041 --> 01:35:03.041
<v Speaker 1>and that also was the same timeline,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's just like the evidence keeps </v>

1816
01:35:03.041 --> 01:35:04.550
<v Speaker 1>accumulating in this time period that </v>
<v Speaker 1>something hit us.</v>

1817
01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:10.000
<v Speaker 1>The micro diamonds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the nuclear glass spikes in warming.</v>

1818
01:35:10.611 --> 01:35:15.611
<v Speaker 1>That's observable on the ice core </v>
<v Speaker 1>correlates that mass extinction events </v>

1819
01:35:15.611 --> 01:35:17.090
<v Speaker 1>of all these animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is an event.</v>

1820
01:35:17.210 --> 01:35:18.570
<v Speaker 1>This is an event.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1821
01:35:18.571 --> 01:35:19.940
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is crazy that you're.</v>

1822
01:35:19.941 --> 01:35:22.820
<v Speaker 1>You're the guy talking about this event.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is really nuts,</v>

1823
01:35:23.800 --> 01:35:28.800
<v Speaker 1>but not anything taken away from you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's so few people beating this </v>

1824
01:35:28.800 --> 01:35:32.330
<v Speaker 1>drum that there's so much information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about hard data.</v>

1825
01:35:33.020 --> 01:35:38.020
<v Speaker 1>You've shown on this show three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>four different examples of hard data </v>

1826
01:35:38.060 --> 01:35:40.430
<v Speaker 1>that points to this event.</v>

1827
01:35:41.090 --> 01:35:42.230
<v Speaker 1>Well see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the thing.</v>

1828
01:35:42.830 --> 01:35:47.830
<v Speaker 1>Modern science does tend to get over </v>
<v Speaker 1>specialized and so what happens is the </v>

1829
01:35:47.830 --> 01:35:50.150
<v Speaker 1>guy looking at extinctions might not be </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at,</v>

1830
01:35:50.490 --> 01:35:51.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>glacial melting.</v>

1831
01:35:52.130 --> 01:35:54.050
<v Speaker 1>The guy who is looking at glacial </v>
<v Speaker 1>melting isn't,</v>

1832
01:35:54.210 --> 01:35:57.620
<v Speaker 1>the geologist is not looking at what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>going on in the sky,</v>

1833
01:35:58.040 --> 01:36:00.250
<v Speaker 1>they're not looking at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1834
01:36:00.290 --> 01:36:05.290
<v Speaker 1>traditions from thousands of years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what it does is because of the power </v>

1835
01:36:06.321 --> 01:36:10.700
<v Speaker 1>of this specialization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>specialization is extremely powerful,</v>

1836
01:36:10.880 --> 01:36:14.270
<v Speaker 1>but he's shortcoming is that it's easy </v>
<v Speaker 1>to miss the big picture.</v>

1837
01:36:14.300 --> 01:36:18.770
<v Speaker 1>What that does is opens the door for </v>
<v Speaker 1>generalists.</v>

1838
01:36:18.800 --> 01:36:22.730
<v Speaker 1>Guys who are just people who are just </v>
<v Speaker 1>say guys,</v>

1839
01:36:22.731 --> 01:36:25.340
<v Speaker 1>men or women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody who's curious about this stuff,</v>

1840
01:36:25.730 --> 01:36:28.220
<v Speaker 1>to look into it and try to see the big </v>
<v Speaker 1>picture.</v>

1841
01:36:28.850 --> 01:36:32.330
<v Speaker 1>Why am I bringing this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it's becAuse for 40 years I've been</v>

1842
01:36:32.331 --> 01:36:37.331
<v Speaker 1>obsessed with this stuff and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I read two or three scientific articles </v>

1843
01:36:37.331 --> 01:36:40.460
<v Speaker 1>every single day and have done so for 40</v>
<v Speaker 1>years plus.</v>

1844
01:36:40.940 --> 01:36:43.570
<v Speaker 1>So that adds up after awhile and I don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>just read them.</v>

1845
01:36:43.571 --> 01:36:45.020
<v Speaker 1>I study,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might take notes,</v>

1846
01:36:45.040 --> 01:36:46.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two or three every single day.</v>

1847
01:36:47.150 --> 01:36:49.640
<v Speaker 1>So you figure what is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's 2000 a year.</v>

1848
01:36:50.120 --> 01:36:55.120
<v Speaker 1>You go back 40 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's means I probably read something </v>

1849
01:36:55.120 --> 01:36:57.200
<v Speaker 1>on the order of 40,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>scientific articles from anthropology,</v>

1850
01:36:57.201 --> 01:37:00.230
<v Speaker 1>geology when I studied geology and </v>
<v Speaker 1>astronomy in college,</v>

1851
01:37:00.231 --> 01:37:03.950
<v Speaker 1>so I have some academic background in </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1852
01:37:03.951 --> 01:37:05.130
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

1853
01:37:05.210 --> 01:37:10.210
<v Speaker 1>basically what I have done is tried to </v>
<v Speaker 1>piece together the big picture because </v>

1854
01:37:10.210 --> 01:37:14.390
<v Speaker 1>early on I saw nobody's doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody's doing it really,</v>

1855
01:37:14.960 --> 01:37:19.960
<v Speaker 1>and some of the guys that are out there </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing it are not doing it with academic </v>

1856
01:37:19.960 --> 01:37:20.300
<v Speaker 1>rigor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1857
01:37:20.301 --> 01:37:25.301
<v Speaker 1>they're bringing in all kinds of weird </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff which makes it easy for the </v>

1858
01:37:25.301 --> 01:37:27.680
<v Speaker 1>critics to attack them and dismiss them </v>
<v Speaker 1>as fringe science.</v>

1859
01:37:28.070 --> 01:37:29.810
<v Speaker 1>The throne,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some wound to the mix.</v>

1860
01:37:29.810 --> 01:37:32.480
<v Speaker 1>They're throwing some wound to the mix.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

1861
01:37:33.930 --> 01:37:36.390
<v Speaker 1>one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1862
01:37:36.790 --> 01:37:41.790
<v Speaker 1>the rational wiki entry on me says </v>
<v Speaker 1>something about randall carlson and he </v>

1863
01:37:41.881 --> 01:37:44.710
<v Speaker 1>is woo and that's all it says.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

1864
01:37:45.020 --> 01:37:49.610
<v Speaker 1>So I took that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so people love to be able to dismiss</v>

1865
01:37:49.611 --> 01:37:51.200
<v Speaker 1>anything that's not mainstream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1866
01:37:51.230 --> 01:37:52.010
<v Speaker 1>It's outside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1867
01:37:52.060 --> 01:37:54.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because there's this cult of authority,</v>

1868
01:37:54.450 --> 01:37:55.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why you're here.</v>

1869
01:37:55.650 --> 01:37:56.280
<v Speaker 1>Somebody says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1870
01:37:56.281 --> 01:37:58.290
<v Speaker 1>what is a real scientists say about </v>
<v Speaker 1>this?</v>

1871
01:37:58.291 --> 01:38:01.620
<v Speaker 1>What is a real scientists say about this</v>
<v Speaker 1>flood into my current role,</v>

1872
01:38:02.350 --> 01:38:04.200
<v Speaker 1>which real scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1873
01:38:04.650 --> 01:38:05.790
<v Speaker 1>vic baker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>richard,</v>

1874
01:38:05.791 --> 01:38:06.610
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1875
01:38:06.700 --> 01:38:08.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roy breckinridge,</v>

1876
01:38:08.101 --> 01:38:08.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

1877
01:38:08.630 --> 01:38:13.630
<v Speaker 1>I've read or talk to every,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost every scientist that's done work </v>

1878
01:38:13.630 --> 01:38:14.440
<v Speaker 1>on the missoula flood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1879
01:38:14.610 --> 01:38:17.220
<v Speaker 1>so I know what they're saying and what </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're thinking,</v>

1880
01:38:17.520 --> 01:38:18.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what they've written it.</v>

1881
01:38:19.100 --> 01:38:20.000
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

1882
01:38:20.050 --> 01:38:20.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you say,</v>

1883
01:38:20.611 --> 01:38:22.020
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are the real scientists say?</v>

1884
01:38:22.020 --> 01:38:22.680
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1885
01:38:22.681 --> 01:38:24.900
<v Speaker 1>let's get a little more specific.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who are you talking about?</v>

1886
01:38:24.901 --> 01:38:26.610
<v Speaker 1>Because there are different points of </v>
<v Speaker 1>view,</v>

1887
01:38:27.010 --> 01:38:29.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you talking about John Shaw idea?</v>

1888
01:38:29.900 --> 01:38:31.440
<v Speaker 1>Are you talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1889
01:38:31.740 --> 01:38:33.870
<v Speaker 1>victor bakers ideas or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>

1890
01:38:33.871 --> 01:38:35.640
<v Speaker 1>or any of the others?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1891
01:38:35.820 --> 01:38:37.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's the thing,</v>

1892
01:38:37.351 --> 01:38:42.351
<v Speaker 1>they say that because they don't really </v>
<v Speaker 1>know they've got this idea in your mind </v>

1893
01:38:42.351 --> 01:38:43.890
<v Speaker 1>that there's this authority that's got </v>
<v Speaker 1>it all explained,</v>

1894
01:38:44.430 --> 01:38:45.840
<v Speaker 1>which makes it easy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1895
01:38:45.841 --> 01:38:50.841
<v Speaker 1>Because if somebody got it explained,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then we don't need to concern ourselves </v>

1896
01:38:50.841 --> 01:38:50.841
<v Speaker 1>with it or think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1897
01:38:51.390 --> 01:38:53.460
<v Speaker 1>so what I say is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1898
01:38:53.940 --> 01:38:58.940
<v Speaker 1>forget about who says what.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's just look at the facts that the </v>

1899
01:38:58.940 --> 01:39:02.220
<v Speaker 1>facts dictate to us what the meaning of </v>
<v Speaker 1>all of this is,</v>

1900
01:39:02.790 --> 01:39:07.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and let's look at all points of view </v>

1901
01:39:07.790 --> 01:39:07.790
<v Speaker 1>because that's what I try to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1902
01:39:07.790 --> 01:39:09.210
<v Speaker 1>I've got in my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my archives here,</v>

1903
01:39:09.211 --> 01:39:09.930
<v Speaker 1>I've got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1904
01:39:09.931 --> 01:39:13.910
<v Speaker 1>not only the research that supports the </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea of a,</v>

1905
01:39:13.970 --> 01:39:16.590
<v Speaker 1>of a cosmic impact back during the </v>
<v Speaker 1>younger dryas,</v>

1906
01:39:16.980 --> 01:39:19.410
<v Speaker 1>but to criticisms of it as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1907
01:39:19.411 --> 01:39:20.100
<v Speaker 1>and I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1908
01:39:20.101 --> 01:39:24.240
<v Speaker 1>how can we explain those criticisms and </v>
<v Speaker 1>into give and take of science.</v>

1909
01:39:24.660 --> 01:39:27.140
<v Speaker 1>That's part of the process,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1910
01:39:27.510 --> 01:39:31.140
<v Speaker 1>that's how it evolves because somebody </v>
<v Speaker 1>puts out a new idea,</v>

1911
01:39:32.070 --> 01:39:33.690
<v Speaker 1>you're supposed to attack it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1912
01:39:33.960 --> 01:39:38.960
<v Speaker 1>and then if it withstands the assault,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the onslaught that shows that it's a </v>

1913
01:39:39.151 --> 01:39:41.100
<v Speaker 1>credible idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1914
01:39:41.130 --> 01:39:42.960
<v Speaker 1>it's like a last man standing sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

1915
01:39:42.961 --> 01:39:46.650
<v Speaker 1>And I think that the cosmic impact </v>
<v Speaker 1>really is going to end up being the last</v>

1916
01:39:46.651 --> 01:39:47.730
<v Speaker 1>man standing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1917
01:39:47.731 --> 01:39:50.240
<v Speaker 1>it seems like there's so much evidence </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're,</v>

1918
01:39:50.260 --> 01:39:52.560
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're bringing up that's so hard.</v>

1919
01:39:52.590 --> 01:39:53.530
<v Speaker 1>You know the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

1920
01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:55.010
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1921
01:39:55.770 --> 01:39:57.510
<v Speaker 1>how do you say that word?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hca.</v>

1922
01:39:57.590 --> 01:39:58.950
<v Speaker 1>Contract.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Contract.</v>

1923
01:39:58.980 --> 01:40:01.500
<v Speaker 1>Contract like mineral from black,</v>
<v Speaker 1>matte,</v>

1924
01:40:01.770 --> 01:40:02.720
<v Speaker 1>I mean all the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1925
01:40:02.780 --> 01:40:04.020
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the various things,</v>

1926
01:40:04.021 --> 01:40:06.750
<v Speaker 1>the micro diamonds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the nuclear glass,</v>

1927
01:40:06.751 --> 01:40:11.751
<v Speaker 1>the mass extinction events,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the evidence of uh,</v>

1928
01:40:11.880 --> 01:40:13.530
<v Speaker 1>the loading,</v>
<v Speaker 1>warming,</v>

1929
01:40:13.531 --> 01:40:14.670
<v Speaker 1>the flooding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the c level,</v>

1930
01:40:14.671 --> 01:40:15.390
<v Speaker 1>raw,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of it.</v>

1931
01:40:15.420 --> 01:40:17.520
<v Speaker 1>All,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all this burn area.</v>

1932
01:40:17.540 --> 01:40:18.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this,</v>

1933
01:40:18.751 --> 01:40:21.510
<v Speaker 1>this is basically st conrad chondrites </v>
<v Speaker 1>are a type of media,</v>

1934
01:40:21.511 --> 01:40:21.810
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1935
01:40:22.320 --> 01:40:23.410
<v Speaker 1>So this is saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

1936
01:40:23.530 --> 01:40:24.900
<v Speaker 1>like material,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in other words,</v>

1937
01:40:24.901 --> 01:40:28.300
<v Speaker 1>material that would have had its origin </v>
<v Speaker 1>in space from the black man.</v>

1938
01:40:28.320 --> 01:40:30.240
<v Speaker 1>Now this black man is really </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>

1939
01:40:30.241 --> 01:40:33.420
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to show you a couple of slides</v>
<v Speaker 1>of it because this black matte layer,</v>

1940
01:40:33.930 --> 01:40:36.240
<v Speaker 1>it's black.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reason it's black is because it's so</v>

1941
01:40:36.241 --> 01:40:41.190
<v Speaker 1>loaded with what is the result of fire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1942
01:40:41.820 --> 01:40:43.260
<v Speaker 1>So let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's go through here.</v>

1943
01:40:43.550 --> 01:40:47.460
<v Speaker 1>This discovery of a nano diamond rich </v>
<v Speaker 1>layer and the greenland ice sheet.</v>

1944
01:40:47.730 --> 01:40:50.520
<v Speaker 1>So nobody had looked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when these guys,</v>

1945
01:40:50.521 --> 01:40:53.100
<v Speaker 1>richard firestone and James West and </v>
<v Speaker 1>james candidate,</v>

1946
01:40:53.140 --> 01:40:54.100
<v Speaker 1>these other scientists</v>

1947
01:40:54.100 --> 01:40:59.100
<v Speaker 3>that are working on this younger dryas </v>
<v Speaker 3>impact hypothesis said to their </v>

1948
01:40:59.100 --> 01:41:03.451
<v Speaker 3>colleagues,</v>
<v Speaker 3>check out the younger dryas boundary </v>

1949
01:41:03.451 --> 01:41:06.690
<v Speaker 3>layer 12,000,</v>
<v Speaker 3>900 years ago and see if there's </v>

1950
01:41:06.690 --> 01:41:06.690
<v Speaker 3>anything that shows up there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They did,</v>

1951
01:41:06.690 --> 01:41:08.440
<v Speaker 3>and what do you suppose they found here </v>
<v Speaker 3>in his right here?</v>

1952
01:41:08.530 --> 01:41:13.530
<v Speaker 3>A nano diamond rich layer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there it is showing up in the ice </v>

1953
01:41:13.530 --> 01:41:17.911
<v Speaker 3>sheets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's new evidence from a black math </v>

1954
01:41:17.911 --> 01:41:19.450
<v Speaker 3>site into northern andy's supporting a </v>
<v Speaker 3>cosmic impact.</v>

1955
01:41:19.540 --> 01:41:21.100
<v Speaker 3>Twelve thousand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>800 years ago,</v>

1956
01:41:22.240 --> 01:41:27.240
<v Speaker 3>a very high temperature impact melt </v>
<v Speaker 3>products as evidence for cosmic airburst</v>

1957
01:41:27.730 --> 01:41:30.580
<v Speaker 3>impacts 12,900.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they,</v>

1958
01:41:30.581 --> 01:41:31.180
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they haven't,</v>

1959
01:41:31.280 --> 01:41:33.850
<v Speaker 3>they're getting closer and closer to </v>
<v Speaker 3>refining the date,</v>

1960
01:41:33.851 --> 01:41:36.910
<v Speaker 3>but it's coming in 12,800</v>
<v Speaker 3>to 12,900</v>

1961
01:41:36.911 --> 01:41:38.320
<v Speaker 3>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1962
01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:44.350
<v Speaker 3>wildlife,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wildfire and abrupt ecosystem disruption</v>

1963
01:41:44.351 --> 01:41:48.340
<v Speaker 3>on california's northern channel islands</v>
<v Speaker 3>at the aloe rod.</v>

1964
01:41:48.400 --> 01:41:51.880
<v Speaker 3>Younger dryas boundary at basically </v>
<v Speaker 3>12,900.</v>

1965
01:41:52.330 --> 01:41:56.860
<v Speaker 3>Twelve point nine k means 12,000,</v>
<v Speaker 3>900 years ago.</v>

1966
01:41:57.220 --> 01:42:00.040
<v Speaker 3>It was the universal means a thousand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>

1967
01:42:00.041 --> 01:42:05.041
<v Speaker 3>It's all the same.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything keeps coming back the same </v>

1968
01:42:05.041 --> 01:42:05.041
<v Speaker 3>date.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1969
01:42:05.041 --> 01:42:09.120
<v Speaker 3>Nano diamond rich layer across three </v>
<v Speaker 3>continents consistent with major cosmic </v>

1970
01:42:09.120 --> 01:42:13.150
<v Speaker 3>impact at 12,800</v>
<v Speaker 3>calendar years before present.</v>

1971
01:42:14.770 --> 01:42:17.590
<v Speaker 3>Evidence from central Mexico supporting </v>
<v Speaker 3>the younger dryas,</v>

1972
01:42:17.650 --> 01:42:22.650
<v Speaker 3>extraterrestrial impact hypothesis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>evidence from northwestern venezuelan,</v>

1973
01:42:23.141 --> 01:42:26.410
<v Speaker 3>andy's for extraterrestrial impact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the black mat,</v>

1974
01:42:26.470 --> 01:42:30.730
<v Speaker 3>enigma evidence for deposition of 10 </v>
<v Speaker 3>million.</v>

1975
01:42:30.731 --> 01:42:33.790
<v Speaker 3>Tons of impact spiros across four </v>
<v Speaker 3>continents.</v>

1976
01:42:33.791 --> 01:42:35.440
<v Speaker 3>Twelve thousand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>800 years ago.</v>

1977
01:42:35.760 --> 01:42:36.640
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's coming in,</v>

1978
01:42:36.670 --> 01:42:41.670
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's coming in and abundance and what's </v>

1979
01:42:41.670 --> 01:42:42.850
<v Speaker 3>gratifying to me as I theorized this 25 </v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago.</v>

1980
01:42:43.030 --> 01:42:48.030
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it to see now the hard evidence </v>

1981
01:42:48.030 --> 01:42:51.631
<v Speaker 3>coming in supporting a scenario I had </v>
<v Speaker 3>pieced together from all of these </v>

1982
01:42:51.631 --> 01:42:54.960
<v Speaker 3>different realms of knowledge is very </v>
<v Speaker 3>gratifying to me.</v>

1983
01:42:55.000 --> 01:43:00.000
<v Speaker 3>What was the seed in your mind that led </v>
<v Speaker 3>you to be obsessed,</v>

1984
01:43:00.190 --> 01:43:02.830
<v Speaker 3>for lack of a better word,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with this anomaly thing?</v>

1985
01:43:02.831 --> 01:43:04.540
<v Speaker 3>Lack of a better word.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's pretty accurate,</v>

1986
01:43:04.541 --> 01:43:05.500
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>With this subject.</v>

1987
01:43:06.520 --> 01:43:08.620
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess iT's time to come clean.</v>

1988
01:43:10.040 --> 01:43:12.790
<v Speaker 3>I was on mushrooms on top of a mountain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1989
01:43:12.791 --> 01:43:14.290
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're actually pretty close.</v>

1990
01:43:17.590 --> 01:43:19.030
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nineteen 69.</v>

1991
01:43:19.470 --> 01:43:20.840
<v Speaker 3>That's a good year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mushrooms.</v>

1992
01:43:21.910 --> 01:43:24.610
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wasn't mushrooms but it was something in</v>

1993
01:43:24.630 --> 01:43:25.870
<v Speaker 3>the family.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1994
01:43:25.990 --> 01:43:28.540
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to a rock concert.</v>

1995
01:43:28.960 --> 01:43:30.940
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the beautiful summer day,</v>

1996
01:43:31.420 --> 01:43:34.150
<v Speaker 3>early summer 12.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Twelve thousand 900 years ago.</v>

1997
01:43:34.170 --> 01:43:36.940
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>19,</v>

1998
01:43:36.941 --> 01:43:38.270
<v Speaker 3>69,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1999
01:43:38.770 --> 01:43:40.490
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's.</v>

2000
01:43:40.630 --> 01:43:45.630
<v Speaker 3>It's on a field next to a little airport</v>
<v Speaker 3>in just out southwest of the twin </v>

2001
01:43:46.451 --> 01:43:47.380
<v Speaker 3>cities,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Minnesota,</v>

2002
01:43:47.381 --> 01:43:50.950
<v Speaker 3>which was near where I grew up in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Minnesota river.</v>

2003
01:43:50.960 --> 01:43:52.580
<v Speaker 3>Flows through there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2004
01:43:52.880 --> 01:43:56.030
<v Speaker 3>Minnesota river flows into the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Mississippi.</v>

2005
01:43:57.140 --> 01:44:00.080
<v Speaker 3>I think I'll have some slides coming up </v>
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>

2006
01:44:00.081 --> 01:44:01.800
<v Speaker 3>I can maybe even show you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2007
01:44:02.150 --> 01:44:07.010
<v Speaker 3>So what we have here is that in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>middle of this thing,</v>

2008
01:44:07.040 --> 01:44:12.040
<v Speaker 3>between bands or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wandered off from the main area where </v>

2009
01:44:12.040 --> 01:44:15.911
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where the crowd was gathered to listen </v>

2010
01:44:15.911 --> 01:44:18.431
<v Speaker 3>to the music and I walked over to these </v>
<v Speaker 3>200 foot high bluffs overlooking the </v>

2011
01:44:18.681 --> 01:44:21.380
<v Speaker 3>valley of the missing of the Minnesota </v>
<v Speaker 3>river.</v>

2012
01:44:22.010 --> 01:44:27.010
<v Speaker 3>Now the Minnesota river currently flows </v>
<v Speaker 3>in a little channel at the bottom of </v>

2013
01:44:27.010 --> 01:44:31.601
<v Speaker 3>this valley and I'm standing up on this </v>
<v Speaker 3>hill and I'm looking down at this </v>

2014
01:44:31.910 --> 01:44:33.740
<v Speaker 3>Minnesota river,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2015
01:44:33.741 --> 01:44:38.741
<v Speaker 3>hundreds of feet below me in this </v>
<v Speaker 3>channel and three miles,</v>

2016
01:44:38.991 --> 01:44:42.890
<v Speaker 3>four miles across.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see another set of bluffs matching the</v>

2017
01:44:42.891 --> 01:44:46.250
<v Speaker 3>ones that I'm standing on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I had this.</v>

2018
01:44:46.550 --> 01:44:51.200
<v Speaker 3>All I can say is this was kind of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>revelation that I'm looking down here at</v>

2019
01:44:51.201 --> 01:44:56.201
<v Speaker 3>this little river flowing into a channel</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then I'm seeing just a gigantic </v>

2020
01:44:56.271 --> 01:45:01.271
<v Speaker 3>version of that same channel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's three and four miles wide and I</v>

2021
01:45:02.001 --> 01:45:07.001
<v Speaker 3>just looked at that and it was almost as</v>
<v Speaker 3>if for a short period of time I got </v>

2022
01:45:08.450 --> 01:45:12.200
<v Speaker 3>transplanted out of time or something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how to explain it.</v>

2023
01:45:12.620 --> 01:45:17.620
<v Speaker 3>You can see this raging river had this </v>
<v Speaker 3>sense that this whole thing was a </v>

2024
01:45:18.441 --> 01:45:19.790
<v Speaker 3>gigantic river.</v>

2025
01:45:19.850 --> 01:45:24.850
<v Speaker 3>At one time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I came away from that with this idea </v>

2026
01:45:24.850 --> 01:45:28.520
<v Speaker 3>planted in the back of my brain and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>bugged me for years after that.</v>

2027
01:45:28.820 --> 01:45:31.410
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it was maybe five,</v>

2028
01:45:31.450 --> 01:45:33.560
<v Speaker 3>six years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is now into the seventies.</v>

2029
01:45:33.740 --> 01:45:38.740
<v Speaker 3>There was not a whole lot on </v>
<v Speaker 3>catastrophism available in the </v>

2030
01:45:38.740 --> 01:45:38.740
<v Speaker 3>seventies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was,</v>

2031
01:45:38.740 --> 01:45:39.800
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a manual makowski,</v>

2032
01:45:39.980 --> 01:45:42.440
<v Speaker 3>one of the forerunners,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

2033
01:45:42.441 --> 01:45:47.441
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he came up with some really wild ideas </v>

2034
01:45:47.441 --> 01:45:48.320
<v Speaker 3>that made it very easy for mainstream </v>
<v Speaker 3>science to dismiss him,</v>

2035
01:45:49.220 --> 01:45:52.520
<v Speaker 3>but he came up with some really solid </v>
<v Speaker 3>ideas to his book.</v>

2036
01:45:52.521 --> 01:45:57.521
<v Speaker 3>Earth and upheaval basically was just a </v>
<v Speaker 3>documentation of all of this geological </v>

2037
01:45:57.521 --> 01:45:58.910
<v Speaker 3>evidence for great catastrophes in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>history of the earth.</v>

2038
01:45:59.690 --> 01:46:02.660
<v Speaker 3>I think he misinterpreted the cause of </v>
<v Speaker 3>those catastrophes.</v>

2039
01:46:02.661 --> 01:46:07.661
<v Speaker 3>But nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you look at the criticisms you've </v>

2040
01:46:07.661 --> 01:46:07.661
<v Speaker 3>heard of the manual vela kosky,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2041
01:46:07.661 --> 01:46:08.990
<v Speaker 3>Fellow cops think I've heard it from </v>
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

2042
01:46:09.410 --> 01:46:10.040
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2043
01:46:10.041 --> 01:46:15.041
<v Speaker 3>he was famous bestselling author,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the big best selling authors of </v>

2044
01:46:15.041 --> 01:46:16.010
<v Speaker 3>the 19 fifties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2045
01:46:16.340 --> 01:46:18.830
<v Speaker 3>maybe in a sense a forerunner of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in fact,</v>

2046
01:46:18.831 --> 01:46:21.950
<v Speaker 3>graham hancock has been compared to vela</v>
<v Speaker 3>koskie now.</v>

2047
01:46:21.960 --> 01:46:24.590
<v Speaker 3>And then I've actually seen some of some</v>
<v Speaker 3>of that.</v>

2048
01:46:24.850 --> 01:46:29.850
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>although vela [inaudible] work I don't </v>

2049
01:46:29.850 --> 01:46:30.430
<v Speaker 3>think was anywhere near as credible as </v>
<v Speaker 3>graham's.</v>

2050
01:46:30.770 --> 01:46:33.860
<v Speaker 3>Graham is very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very assiduous in his,</v>

2051
01:46:33.980 --> 01:46:38.980
<v Speaker 3>his referencing in his detailing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so vela kosky went way off into this</v>

2052
01:46:39.051 --> 01:46:41.910
<v Speaker 3>really weird astrophysics to explain </v>
<v Speaker 3>his,</v>

2053
01:46:41.970 --> 01:46:46.970
<v Speaker 3>his theories of geological catastrophe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which again allowed the critics to </v>

2054
01:46:46.970 --> 01:46:48.980
<v Speaker 3>basically dismiss everything he had done</v>
<v Speaker 3>so.</v>

2055
01:46:49.170 --> 01:46:50.820
<v Speaker 3>But his book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>earth and upheaval,</v>

2056
01:46:50.850 --> 01:46:54.150
<v Speaker 3>I think has upheld the test of time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We were basically in the 19 fifties.</v>

2057
01:46:54.151 --> 01:46:59.151
<v Speaker 3>He was accumulating all of this evidence</v>
<v Speaker 3>suggesting that there had been </v>

2058
01:46:59.151 --> 01:47:01.760
<v Speaker 3>catastrophes in earth history and what </v>
<v Speaker 3>was it,</v>

2059
01:47:01.920 --> 01:47:03.150
<v Speaker 3>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a best seller,</v>

2060
01:47:03.570 --> 01:47:06.960
<v Speaker 3>but the mainstream scientific community </v>
<v Speaker 3>was very dismissive of it.</v>

2061
01:47:07.860 --> 01:47:12.860
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then after that you had a book </v>

2062
01:47:12.860 --> 01:47:12.860
<v Speaker 3>called,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2063
01:47:12.860 --> 01:47:17.000
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by charles hapgood called the path of </v>

2064
01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:20.271
<v Speaker 3>the pole.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it came out in [inaudible] 76 </v>

2065
01:47:20.271 --> 01:47:23.270
<v Speaker 3>and he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he and near theorized that there had </v>

2066
01:47:23.270 --> 01:47:24.110
<v Speaker 3>been a sudden shift that had brought </v>
<v Speaker 3>about the quick freezing of the mammoths</v>

2067
01:47:24.111 --> 01:47:26.940
<v Speaker 3>and the end of the ice age and so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2068
01:47:27.360 --> 01:47:29.430
<v Speaker 3>so I was familiar with that stuff and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>would,</v>

2069
01:47:29.460 --> 01:47:32.160
<v Speaker 3>I would read that stuff just out of </v>
<v Speaker 3>curiosity,</v>

2070
01:47:32.250 --> 01:47:33.070
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2071
01:47:33.510 --> 01:47:35.670
<v Speaker 3>because that was some of the stuff that </v>
<v Speaker 3>was out there.</v>

2072
01:47:35.671 --> 01:47:36.850
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and um,</v>

2073
01:47:36.940 --> 01:47:37.860
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody would say,</v>

2074
01:47:37.861 --> 01:47:39.380
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did you read the lukowski?</v>

2075
01:47:39.390 --> 01:47:43.200
<v Speaker 3>And so as I was reading this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would keep thinking back to this image</v>

2076
01:47:43.201 --> 01:47:45.340
<v Speaker 3>I'd had of this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

2077
01:47:45.420 --> 01:47:48.300
<v Speaker 3>And then in early eighties I was talking</v>
<v Speaker 3>to somebody,</v>

2078
01:47:48.301 --> 01:47:53.301
<v Speaker 3>I actually gave one of my very early </v>
<v Speaker 3>lectures on this stuff and there was </v>

2079
01:47:53.301 --> 01:47:54.360
<v Speaker 3>somebody who had a degree in geology who</v>
<v Speaker 3>stood up and he said,</v>

2080
01:47:54.870 --> 01:47:55.260
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2081
01:47:55.261 --> 01:47:55.530
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2082
01:47:55.531 --> 01:47:57.930
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that valley that you're talking about,</v>

2083
01:47:57.931 --> 01:47:59.730
<v Speaker 3>which created over millions of years.</v>

2084
01:48:00.540 --> 01:48:01.500
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so.</v>

2085
01:48:02.010 --> 01:48:04.110
<v Speaker 3>And we kind of got into it a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

2086
01:48:04.111 --> 01:48:06.120
<v Speaker 3>but what that did was it kind of pissed </v>
<v Speaker 3>me off.</v>

2087
01:48:06.540 --> 01:48:07.200
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2088
01:48:07.201 --> 01:48:10.260
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to research this thoroughly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I did.</v>

2089
01:48:10.290 --> 01:48:15.290
<v Speaker 3>I thoroughly researched it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went and I found every single thing </v>

2090
01:48:15.290 --> 01:48:18.591
<v Speaker 3>that had been written on it and </v>
<v Speaker 3>discovered that there's actually </v>

2091
01:48:18.591 --> 01:48:18.591
<v Speaker 3>mainstream geologists that have said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2092
01:48:19.080 --> 01:48:24.080
<v Speaker 3>that river channel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that giant river channel was actually </v>

2093
01:48:24.080 --> 01:48:27.150
<v Speaker 3>created by a huge meltwater flood.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they estimated that it's volume.</v>

2094
01:48:27.151 --> 01:48:30.150
<v Speaker 3>They called it river warren.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They estimated it as volume,</v>

2095
01:48:30.151 --> 01:48:35.151
<v Speaker 3>might've been 4,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>times greater than the modern Minnesota </v>

2096
01:48:35.151 --> 01:48:36.890
<v Speaker 3>river that's flowing in there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I felt very vindicated from that.</v>

2097
01:48:36.900 --> 01:48:41.160
<v Speaker 3>And this was by the early eighties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that was like one of the key things.</v>

2098
01:48:41.161 --> 01:48:42.180
<v Speaker 3>There was other things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2099
01:48:42.181 --> 01:48:47.181
<v Speaker 3>I um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I spent the summer of 1970 mostly </v>

2100
01:48:47.181 --> 01:48:48.910
<v Speaker 3>sitting on a mountain top in Colorado,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2101
01:48:49.140 --> 01:48:52.780
<v Speaker 3>in a hut that I had built studying and </v>
<v Speaker 3>reading stuff and,</v>

2102
01:48:52.781 --> 01:48:53.880
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and traveling.</v>

2103
01:48:53.910 --> 01:48:58.910
<v Speaker 3>I knoW this was back in the days when </v>
<v Speaker 3>you could hitchhike and travel all over </v>

2104
01:48:58.910 --> 01:49:03.111
<v Speaker 3>and I think at one point I was with a </v>
<v Speaker 3>buddy and we were in his old camper van </v>

2105
01:49:03.111 --> 01:49:07.461
<v Speaker 3>and other times I would teach anchor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I spent the whole summer traveling </v>

2106
01:49:07.461 --> 01:49:11.181
<v Speaker 3>around the western states.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the thing I came away from that </v>

2107
01:49:11.581 --> 01:49:16.581
<v Speaker 3>summer with the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd traveled the first time I had </v>

2108
01:49:16.581 --> 01:49:17.010
<v Speaker 3>traveled down to columbia gorge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And as I did,</v>

2109
01:49:17.011 --> 01:49:22.011
<v Speaker 3>I had this overwhelming sense that there</v>
<v Speaker 3>was something in the landscape that I </v>

2110
01:49:22.141 --> 01:49:23.280
<v Speaker 3>was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was,</v>

2111
01:49:24.690 --> 01:49:29.690
<v Speaker 3>that was waiting to be revealed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would look at these features in the </v>

2112
01:49:29.690 --> 01:49:33.321
<v Speaker 3>columbia records when I showed you that </v>
<v Speaker 3>huge waterfall with the basalt over and </v>

2113
01:49:33.321 --> 01:49:37.550
<v Speaker 3>that's in the columbia gorge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that was the area I had traveled </v>

2114
01:49:37.550 --> 01:49:40.791
<v Speaker 3>through in 1970.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I came away with that with this </v>

2115
01:49:40.791 --> 01:49:41.010
<v Speaker 3>sense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that point or something that,</v>

2116
01:49:41.011 --> 01:49:45.990
<v Speaker 3>that landscape is trying to tell me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so it goes back to that and I just,</v>

2117
01:49:46.020 --> 01:49:48.400
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got very in this stuff</v>

2118
01:49:48.780 --> 01:49:51.910
<v Speaker 1>because I'm interested a in science and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I love the outdoors.</v>

2119
01:49:52.540 --> 01:49:55.080
<v Speaker 1>So I love a good mystery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2120
01:49:55.120 --> 01:49:56.680
<v Speaker 1>and I love,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2121
01:49:56.710 --> 01:50:00.700
<v Speaker 1>ancient traditions were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So all this sort of came together over a</v>

2122
01:50:00.701 --> 01:50:02.810
<v Speaker 1>period of a couple of decades.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2123
01:50:03.580 --> 01:50:08.580
<v Speaker 1>so I began really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say obsessive lee really going </v>

2124
01:50:08.580 --> 01:50:10.360
<v Speaker 1>into this in the early eighties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2125
01:50:10.361 --> 01:50:14.470
<v Speaker 1>where it went from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just more or less casual reading into,</v>

2126
01:50:15.010 --> 01:50:20.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>spending hours in university libraries </v>

2127
01:50:20.010 --> 01:50:21.760
<v Speaker 1>for digging up these things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Going back to the ninth,</v>

2128
01:50:21.790 --> 01:50:25.780
<v Speaker 1>going back to the early geologists to </v>
<v Speaker 1>see what were they saying,</v>

2129
01:50:25.781 --> 01:50:29.950
<v Speaker 1>why did they believe that the history of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the earth had been catastrophic,</v>

2130
01:50:30.190 --> 01:50:31.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>

2131
01:50:31.720 --> 01:50:36.720
<v Speaker 1>and it just accelerated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't seem like a ridiculous idea </v>

2132
01:50:36.720 --> 01:50:41.101
<v Speaker 1>at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you consider what we see on the </v>

2133
01:50:41.101 --> 01:50:41.590
<v Speaker 1>moon and the moon is so fascinating </v>
<v Speaker 1>because we can look right at it.</v>

2134
01:50:41.860 --> 01:50:44.050
<v Speaker 1>There's no oceans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no forests.</v>

2135
01:50:44.350 --> 01:50:48.280
<v Speaker 1>We can see the evidence of impacts all </v>
<v Speaker 1>over it just completely covered,</v>

2136
01:50:48.281 --> 01:50:53.281
<v Speaker 1>completely covered with our minds living</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this very small window of life,</v>

2137
01:50:53.590 --> 01:50:54.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we're lucky,</v>

2138
01:50:54.521 --> 01:50:59.521
<v Speaker 1>we get 100 years and then of course we </v>
<v Speaker 1>have the history which goes back to </v>

2139
01:50:59.521 --> 01:51:03.301
<v Speaker 1>about seven plus thousand years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is not enough to really to </v>

2140
01:51:03.490 --> 01:51:06.100
<v Speaker 1>represent what we're looking at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When we look at the moon,</v>

2141
01:51:06.550 --> 01:51:08.860
<v Speaker 1>we look at the moon that's covered with </v>
<v Speaker 1>craters.</v>

2142
01:51:09.070 --> 01:51:13.240
<v Speaker 1>We're looking at potentially billions of</v>
<v Speaker 1>years of impacts.</v>

2143
01:51:13.300 --> 01:51:14.010
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

2144
01:51:14.040 --> 01:51:19.040
<v Speaker 1>and the assumption that those impacts </v>
<v Speaker 1>ceased hundreds of millions or billions </v>

2145
01:51:20.230 --> 01:51:22.300
<v Speaker 1>of years ago is clearly not correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2146
01:51:22.301 --> 01:51:24.870
<v Speaker 1>there's no evidence that seized or why </v>
<v Speaker 1>it would cease.</v>

2147
01:51:25.510 --> 01:51:30.400
<v Speaker 1>When we look at how many we known near </v>
<v Speaker 1>earth objects are floating around.</v>

2148
01:51:30.790 --> 01:51:35.790
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the last few years there's been </v>

2149
01:51:35.790 --> 01:51:37.381
<v Speaker 1>dozens of close flybys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was one the other day that had a </v>

2150
01:51:37.381 --> 01:51:37.381
<v Speaker 1>fucking moon.</v>

2151
01:51:37.381 --> 01:51:38.110
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2152
01:51:38.530 --> 01:51:42.460
<v Speaker 1>So something that flew by that have its </v>
<v Speaker 1>own moon.</v>

2153
01:51:42.580 --> 01:51:43.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2154
01:51:43.720 --> 01:51:46.630
<v Speaker 1>That's wild.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so think about this,</v>

2155
01:51:46.631 --> 01:51:47.680
<v Speaker 1>joe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's what's happening.</v>

2156
01:51:48.310 --> 01:51:53.310
<v Speaker 1>We've got geologists who are looking at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the crust of the earth in discovering </v>

2157
01:51:53.310 --> 01:51:53.650
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2158
01:51:53.680 --> 01:51:58.680
<v Speaker 1>if we strip away the biosphere in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>oceans and an account for plate </v>

2159
01:51:58.680 --> 01:52:02.971
<v Speaker 1>tectonics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the earth is going to look like the </v>

2160
01:52:02.971 --> 01:52:02.971
<v Speaker 1>moon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2161
01:52:02.971 --> 01:52:04.750
<v Speaker 1>Are noW hundreds of identified craters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2162
01:52:05.200 --> 01:52:10.200
<v Speaker 1>At the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>astronomers are looking out into the </v>

2163
01:52:10.200 --> 01:52:11.470
<v Speaker 1>near space near the near earth </v>
<v Speaker 1>neighborhood of space and discovering,</v>

2164
01:52:12.010 --> 01:52:17.010
<v Speaker 1>wait a second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we assumed that we were pretty much </v>

2165
01:52:17.010 --> 01:52:17.800
<v Speaker 1>isolated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was nothing else going on.</v>

2166
01:52:17.801 --> 01:52:21.280
<v Speaker 1>We're now realizing that near or spaces </v>
<v Speaker 1>densely populated,</v>

2167
01:52:21.281 --> 01:52:26.281
<v Speaker 1>the inner solar system is densely </v>
<v Speaker 1>populated with cosmic debris and this </v>

2168
01:52:27.131 --> 01:52:31.270
<v Speaker 1>stuff is western bias all the time and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's now at the same time.</v>

2169
01:52:31.300 --> 01:52:36.300
<v Speaker 1>You've got paleontologists who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at the record of life and </v>

2170
01:52:36.300 --> 01:52:40.030
<v Speaker 1>realizing that the record of life is not</v>
<v Speaker 1>a smooth curve.</v>

2171
01:52:40.300 --> 01:52:42.150
<v Speaker 1>It seesawed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2172
01:52:42.370 --> 01:52:47.370
<v Speaker 1>life proliferates and then suddenly bam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the hammer comes down and you </v>

2173
01:52:47.370 --> 01:52:49.940
<v Speaker 1>have these mass extinction events,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so this is our time right now,</v>

2174
01:52:49.970 --> 01:52:54.970
<v Speaker 1>but it could very easily end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There could be some new bug like </v>

2175
01:52:54.970 --> 01:52:58.820
<v Speaker 1>creature that takes over and become </v>
<v Speaker 1>super smart a billion years from now.</v>

2176
01:52:58.900 --> 01:53:00.620
<v Speaker 1>To me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it all comes down to this.</v>

2177
01:53:00.920 --> 01:53:03.530
<v Speaker 1>This to me is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2178
01:53:04.040 --> 01:53:09.040
<v Speaker 1>human species on planet earth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's time for you to grow up and start </v>

2179
01:53:09.040 --> 01:53:10.670
<v Speaker 1>paying attention to the bigger picture </v>
<v Speaker 1>because whether you like it or not,</v>

2180
01:53:11.060 --> 01:53:13.430
<v Speaker 1>you're a part of the bigger picture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if we,</v>

2181
01:53:13.490 --> 01:53:18.490
<v Speaker 1>if we finally accept the fact that maybe</v>
<v Speaker 1>our predecessors have undergone in a </v>

2182
01:53:18.490 --> 01:53:20.210
<v Speaker 1>sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cultural mass extinctions,</v>

2183
01:53:20.690 --> 01:53:25.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it suddenly implies that we can't take </v>

2184
01:53:25.690 --> 01:53:28.740
<v Speaker 1>our own unending future for granted that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have.</v>

2185
01:53:28.860 --> 01:53:31.820
<v Speaker 1>We have to incorporate this bigger </v>
<v Speaker 1>picture into our thinking.</v>

2186
01:53:32.300 --> 01:53:37.300
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the evidence has continues to yes.</v>

2187
01:53:38.720 --> 01:53:43.720
<v Speaker 1>Like here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this was just from 2011 multiple lines </v>

2188
01:53:43.720 --> 01:53:46.520
<v Speaker 1>of evidence for possible human </v>
<v Speaker 1>population decline.</v>

2189
01:53:46.550 --> 01:53:49.520
<v Speaker 1>Settlement reorganization during the </v>
<v Speaker 1>early,</v>

2190
01:53:49.521 --> 01:53:53.270
<v Speaker 1>younger dryas into three years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>four years since this was published.</v>

2191
01:53:53.330 --> 01:53:56.800
<v Speaker 1>More evidence has emerged that yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2192
01:53:57.520 --> 01:54:02.520
<v Speaker 1>the events that caused the mass </v>
<v Speaker 1>extinction of half the great mega </v>

2193
01:54:02.520 --> 01:54:05.681
<v Speaker 1>mammals on earth did not leave the rest </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the mammals the rest of the animals </v>

2194
01:54:05.751 --> 01:54:07.580
<v Speaker 1>unscathed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including humans.</v>

2195
01:54:07.880 --> 01:54:12.880
<v Speaker 1>And there is now emerging evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hard scientific evidence that the human </v>

2196
01:54:12.880 --> 01:54:13.850
<v Speaker 1>population crashed during the younger </v>
<v Speaker 1>dryas.</v>

2197
01:54:15.260 --> 01:54:20.260
<v Speaker 1>So this would completely coincide with </v>
<v Speaker 1>graham hancock's ideas about the sphinx.</v>

2198
01:54:22.620 --> 01:54:25.580
<v Speaker 1>Sphinx.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely showing very clear,</v>

2199
01:54:25.581 --> 01:54:29.540
<v Speaker 1>according to robert schoch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boston university geologists,</v>

2200
01:54:29.541 --> 01:54:31.310
<v Speaker 1>John Anthony West,</v>
<v Speaker 1>John Anthony West,</v>

2201
01:54:31.550 --> 01:54:34.790
<v Speaker 1>that there is clear evidence of water </v>
<v Speaker 1>erosion on the sphinx,</v>

2202
01:54:35.030 --> 01:54:40.030
<v Speaker 1>which would indicate thousands of years </v>
<v Speaker 1>of rainfall where there hasn't been </v>

2203
01:54:40.161 --> 01:54:43.270
<v Speaker 1>rainfall in the nile valley since,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe it was 9,000</v>

2204
01:54:43.280 --> 01:54:43.820
<v Speaker 1>bc.</v>

2205
01:54:44.060 --> 01:54:46.340
<v Speaker 1>So that's 11,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>

2206
01:54:46.400 --> 01:54:48.530
<v Speaker 1>It's all the same stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all the same stuff.</v>

2207
01:54:48.560 --> 01:54:50.240
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is crazy.</v>

2208
01:54:50.820 --> 01:54:51.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

2209
01:54:51.321 --> 01:54:51.800
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

2210
01:54:51.801 --> 01:54:56.801
<v Speaker 1>we're on the verge of a major paradIgm </v>
<v Speaker 1>shift and where it's going to go remains</v>

2211
01:54:58.401 --> 01:55:00.260
<v Speaker 1>to be seen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We live in a shooting gallery.</v>

2212
01:55:00.350 --> 01:55:02.450
<v Speaker 1>We live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We listened.</v>

2213
01:55:02.480 --> 01:55:06.710
<v Speaker 1>it's not an exaggeration to say that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>are sitting ducks in a cosmic shooting.</v>

2214
01:55:06.711 --> 01:55:07.880
<v Speaker 1>Gail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

2215
01:55:09.530 --> 01:55:11.900
<v Speaker 1>But the point is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the point,</v>

2216
01:55:11.960 --> 01:55:14.570
<v Speaker 1>is the only thing that's see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

2217
01:55:14.930 --> 01:55:16.790
<v Speaker 1>what was it in the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the book of matthew,</v>

2218
01:55:16.791 --> 01:55:18.210
<v Speaker 1>there's an interesting quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not,</v>

2219
01:55:18.880 --> 01:55:23.880
<v Speaker 1>I'm not not thumping the bible here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the bible is full of just like all </v>

2220
01:55:23.880 --> 01:55:27.551
<v Speaker 1>the traditions of ages are gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The bible is full of some very powerful,</v>

2221
01:55:27.741 --> 01:55:32.741
<v Speaker 1>interesting stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a part in here and we're one of </v>

2222
01:55:32.741 --> 01:55:35.090
<v Speaker 1>the disciples asked jesus about when are</v>
<v Speaker 1>we going to know about the end of days?</v>

2223
01:55:35.540 --> 01:55:36.260
<v Speaker 1>And he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2224
01:55:36.261 --> 01:55:41.261
<v Speaker 1>as it was in the days of noah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the people were eating and drinking</v>

2225
01:55:41.701 --> 01:55:46.701
<v Speaker 1>and marrying and giving in marriage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So will it be again in the days,</v>

2226
01:55:47.040 --> 01:55:52.040
<v Speaker 1>the end of days when the flood comes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the people were eating and </v>

2227
01:55:52.040 --> 01:55:56.361
<v Speaker 1>drinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>marrying and giving in marriage until </v>

2228
01:55:56.361 --> 01:55:58.650
<v Speaker 1>the flood came and swept them away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So will it be again at the end of days?</v>

2229
01:55:58.680 --> 01:56:03.680
<v Speaker 1>So what that seems to indicate to me is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we just get comfortable and relaxed</v>

2230
01:56:03.961 --> 01:56:06.390
<v Speaker 1>and do well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when we do well,</v>

2231
01:56:06.391 --> 01:56:11.391
<v Speaker 1>that's when you get hit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's not saying that the everyday </v>

2232
01:56:11.391 --> 01:56:12.150
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the stuff of everyday life,</v>

2233
01:56:12.180 --> 01:56:13.770
<v Speaker 1>there's anything wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not saying that,</v>

2234
01:56:13.800 --> 01:56:18.800
<v Speaker 1>it's just saying if we get so </v>
<v Speaker 1>preoccupied with the minutia and the </v>

2235
01:56:18.800 --> 01:56:21.300
<v Speaker 1>trivia of everyday life to the exclusion</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the bigger picture,</v>

2236
01:56:21.360 --> 01:56:23.910
<v Speaker 1>that's when we open ourselves up with </v>
<v Speaker 1>has been.</v>

2237
01:56:24.360 --> 01:56:29.360
<v Speaker 1>I've had these weird coNversations with </v>
<v Speaker 1>people about asteroidal impacts over the</v>

2238
01:56:29.490 --> 01:56:29.840
<v Speaker 1>years because I've.</v>

2239
01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:32.670
<v Speaker 1>Before I even met you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been obsessed with this stuff.</v>

2240
01:56:33.060 --> 01:56:38.060
<v Speaker 1>not nearly as much as when I met you in </v>
<v Speaker 1>atlanta and we started talking then I </v>

2241
01:56:38.060 --> 01:56:41.691
<v Speaker 1>got really into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>but would they would talk about the </v>

2242
01:56:41.691 --> 01:56:42.240
<v Speaker 1>asteroids that killed the dinosaur.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2243
01:56:42.241 --> 01:56:44.670
<v Speaker 1>today we'd be able to stop that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

2244
01:56:44.700 --> 01:56:45.750
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really?</v>

2245
01:56:45.810 --> 01:56:47.760
<v Speaker 1>Is that true?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I started looking into it.</v>

2246
01:56:47.761 --> 01:56:49.860
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what has been done is nothing.</v>

2247
01:56:49.890 --> 01:56:51.750
<v Speaker 1>Some fucking theories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See here,</v>

2248
01:56:51.780 --> 01:56:54.360
<v Speaker 1>here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Potentially yes we could.</v>

2249
01:56:54.470 --> 01:56:55.790
<v Speaker 1>Someday we could do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

2250
01:56:55.791 --> 01:56:57.370
<v Speaker 1>and really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2251
01:56:57.390 --> 01:56:59.010
<v Speaker 1>within,</v>
<v Speaker 1>within a decade or two.</v>

2252
01:56:59.040 --> 01:57:02.280
<v Speaker 1>Yes we could.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We could do that right now potentially.</v>

2253
01:57:02.610 --> 01:57:07.610
<v Speaker 1>But see what happened on February 15th </v>
<v Speaker 1>of 2014 when that little meatier came in</v>

2254
01:57:07.651 --> 01:57:12.651
<v Speaker 1>and exploded over chelyabinsk siberia </v>
<v Speaker 1>injured 1500 people now in damaged </v>

2255
01:57:15.361 --> 01:57:18.000
<v Speaker 1>thousands of buildings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a wake up call,</v>

2256
01:57:18.060 --> 01:57:19.860
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a little suspect.</v>

2257
01:57:20.130 --> 01:57:22.500
<v Speaker 1>it was a little speck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now here's the thing,</v>

2258
01:57:22.650 --> 01:57:25.650
<v Speaker 1>if he had been a little bigger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little dancer,</v>

2259
01:57:25.740 --> 01:57:28.650
<v Speaker 1>if it's an angle of approach,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had been a little steeper.</v>

2260
01:57:29.100 --> 01:57:31.230
<v Speaker 1>If it's velocity had been a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>greater,</v>

2261
01:57:31.231 --> 01:57:36.231
<v Speaker 1>we might've been looking at thousands of</v>
<v Speaker 1>deaths rather than just injuries and </v>

2262
01:57:36.231 --> 01:57:37.350
<v Speaker 1>tunguska,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you said,</v>

2263
01:57:37.351 --> 01:57:42.090
<v Speaker 1>only 150 foot wide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Only 150 foot wide objeCt.</v>

2264
01:57:42.091 --> 01:57:42.750
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2265
01:57:42.751 --> 01:57:45.680
<v Speaker 1>So that's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very small in the cosmic sense.</v>

2266
01:57:45.690 --> 01:57:47.600
<v Speaker 1>This room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2267
01:57:47.650 --> 01:57:50.850
<v Speaker 1>Well it's the building from here to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>front door,</v>

2268
01:57:51.510 --> 01:57:52.830
<v Speaker 1>you knoW what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not that big.</v>

2269
01:57:52.860 --> 01:57:57.860
<v Speaker 1>It's not that big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once you've got though is velocity and </v>

2270
01:57:57.860 --> 01:57:57.860
<v Speaker 1>you think like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2271
01:57:57.860 --> 01:58:00.000
<v Speaker 1>think of a say a 38 slug.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not big.</v>

2272
01:58:00.001 --> 01:58:02.280
<v Speaker 1>If I was to throw it at you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even as hard as I could,</v>

2273
01:58:02.281 --> 01:58:04.710
<v Speaker 1>it might sting a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it wouldn't do any damage,</v>

2274
01:58:05.100 --> 01:58:10.100
<v Speaker 1>but if it came out of a gun with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>muzzle velocity of a thousand feet per </v>

2275
01:58:10.100 --> 01:58:13.671
<v Speaker 1>second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think about that little thing and what </v>

2276
01:58:13.671 --> 01:58:15.411
<v Speaker 1>the damage it would do to you and see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing about an asteroid or </v>

2277
01:58:15.411 --> 01:58:17.370
<v Speaker 1>meteorite or a comet coming in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's moving really,</v>

2278
01:58:17.371 --> 01:58:19.660
<v Speaker 1>really fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2279
01:58:19.800 --> 01:58:22.590
<v Speaker 1>so that's why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>

2280
01:58:22.591 --> 01:58:27.591
<v Speaker 1>it packs such a powerful kinetic punch </v>
<v Speaker 1>when it hits and some of them are even </v>

2281
01:58:27.591 --> 01:58:31.971
<v Speaker 1>made of iron.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of them are made of iron and so.</v>

2282
01:58:33.270 --> 01:58:34.140
<v Speaker 1>So if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there's,</v>

2283
01:58:34.170 --> 01:58:37.290
<v Speaker 1>if there's a moral dollar this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's simply this look,</v>

2284
01:58:37.770 --> 01:58:41.980
<v Speaker 1>we are the one species that could </v>
<v Speaker 1>prevent the type of mass</v>

2285
01:58:41.980 --> 01:58:45.820
<v Speaker 3>extinctions that have dominated the </v>
<v Speaker 3>biosphere of this planet for a couple of</v>

2286
01:58:45.821 --> 01:58:50.821
<v Speaker 3>hundred million years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or we could keep putting our resources </v>

2287
01:58:50.821 --> 01:58:50.821
<v Speaker 3>to fracking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2288
01:58:50.821 --> 01:58:55.620
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I still haven't made up my mind about </v>

2289
01:58:55.620 --> 01:58:57.370
<v Speaker 3>fracking yet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I do believe that what we need to do</v>

2290
01:58:57.430 --> 01:59:02.430
<v Speaker 3>is be thinking of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we're going to extract the resources </v>

2291
01:59:02.430 --> 01:59:06.061
<v Speaker 3>of this planet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's do so in such a way that what </v>

2292
01:59:06.061 --> 01:59:09.631
<v Speaker 3>we're doing is implementing the </v>
<v Speaker 3>transcendence of human culture into the </v>

2293
01:59:10.151 --> 01:59:13.300
<v Speaker 3>cosmos itself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I ultimately believe that is the</v>

2294
01:59:13.301 --> 01:59:17.920
<v Speaker 3>destiny of terrestrial life is the </v>
<v Speaker 3>terrestrial life wants to become cosmic.</v>

2295
01:59:17.950 --> 01:59:22.030
<v Speaker 3>It knows on some level that as long as </v>
<v Speaker 3>life,</v>

2296
01:59:22.031 --> 01:59:24.610
<v Speaker 3>it's confined to the surface of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>planet.</v>

2297
01:59:24.640 --> 01:59:26.500
<v Speaker 3>It's vulnerable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2298
01:59:26.740 --> 01:59:27.450
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

2299
01:59:27.880 --> 01:59:29.410
<v Speaker 3>without getting into all of this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

2300
01:59:29.500 --> 01:59:34.500
<v Speaker 3>there's growing evidence that life </v>
<v Speaker 3>originally came to this planet from </v>

2301
01:59:34.500 --> 01:59:34.570
<v Speaker 3>space,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2302
01:59:34.840 --> 01:59:39.010
<v Speaker 3>Was seated here probably through comets </v>
<v Speaker 3>that carry organic material.</v>

2303
01:59:39.010 --> 01:59:40.650
<v Speaker 3>All been.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Spare me her hand sperm.</v>

2304
01:59:40.651 --> 01:59:41.620
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

2305
01:59:42.520 --> 01:59:47.520
<v Speaker 3>So here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're an environmentalist and </v>

2306
01:59:47.520 --> 01:59:52.500
<v Speaker 3>rightfully critical of some of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>things that humans are doing to disrupt </v>

2307
01:59:52.500 --> 01:59:54.730
<v Speaker 3>the environment you got to the place in </v>
<v Speaker 3>context,</v>

2308
01:59:54.731 --> 01:59:59.731
<v Speaker 3>the fact that nature itself has done </v>
<v Speaker 3>things to the environment so that so far</v>

2309
02:00:00.011 --> 02:00:03.880
<v Speaker 3>exceed anything we have done yet what I </v>
<v Speaker 3>showed you with that slide,</v>

2310
02:00:03.910 --> 02:00:07.060
<v Speaker 3>showing the ice sheets over candidate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Think about this.</v>

2311
02:00:07.690 --> 02:00:12.640
<v Speaker 3>Suppose some logging company got a </v>
<v Speaker 3>contract from the government,</v>

2312
02:00:12.840 --> 02:00:17.840
<v Speaker 3>us and canadian governments to clear cut</v>
<v Speaker 3>every forest from like the 47th parallel</v>

2313
02:00:19.150 --> 02:00:21.760
<v Speaker 3>up to the arctic circle from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>atlantic to the pacific.</v>

2314
02:00:21.761 --> 02:00:26.761
<v Speaker 3>We're going to cut every single tree </v>
<v Speaker 3>from the northern United States up to </v>

2315
02:00:26.980 --> 02:00:28.990
<v Speaker 3>the tree line in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in northern Canada.</v>

2316
02:00:29.290 --> 02:00:32.470
<v Speaker 3>We're going to cut billions of trees,</v>
<v Speaker 3>billions of board feet.</v>

2317
02:00:32.471 --> 02:00:34.270
<v Speaker 3>we're going to clear cut every single </v>
<v Speaker 3>tree.</v>

2318
02:00:34.810 --> 02:00:36.850
<v Speaker 3>We would rightfully be up in arms and </v>
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>

2319
02:00:36.851 --> 02:00:38.080
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not going to do that.</v>

2320
02:00:38.380 --> 02:00:39.250
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2321
02:00:39.251 --> 02:00:42.520
<v Speaker 3>what do you think that ice did?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wiped out.</v>

2322
02:00:42.760 --> 02:00:45.220
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's evidence now that 35 and 40,000</v>

2323
02:00:45.221 --> 02:00:47.470
<v Speaker 3>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there were forests growing up there,</v>

2324
02:00:48.050 --> 02:00:50.440
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>A few thousand years later,</v>

2325
02:00:50.890 --> 02:00:55.890
<v Speaker 3>the ice has bulldozed everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no forest growing under two </v>

2326
02:00:55.890 --> 02:00:55.890
<v Speaker 3>miles of ice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2327
02:00:56.800 --> 02:00:57.940
<v Speaker 3>Imagine if we said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2328
02:00:57.941 --> 02:01:01.360
<v Speaker 3>we're going to just decimate the shallow</v>
<v Speaker 3>marine ecology.</v>

2329
02:01:01.420 --> 02:01:06.420
<v Speaker 3>We're going to go in there and we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to just wiPe out the coral reefs </v>

2330
02:01:06.420 --> 02:01:06.420
<v Speaker 3>were going to overfish them till there's</v>
<v Speaker 3>no nothing,</v>

2331
02:01:06.420 --> 02:01:08.420
<v Speaker 3>nothing left of the shallow marine </v>
<v Speaker 3>ecology.</v>

2332
02:01:08.570 --> 02:01:12.670
<v Speaker 3>Ecology is less than 400 feet below sea </v>
<v Speaker 3>level.</v>

2333
02:01:13.510 --> 02:01:18.510
<v Speaker 3>What do you think are dropping 400 feet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>400 feet in the c level did to the </v>

2334
02:01:18.510 --> 02:01:22.360
<v Speaker 3>shallow marine ecologies to the coral </v>
<v Speaker 3>reefs that were growing there.</v>

2335
02:01:22.630 --> 02:01:25.630
<v Speaker 3>You see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's where I'm just saying it's not to</v>

2336
02:01:25.631 --> 02:01:29.350
<v Speaker 3>justify that we can ransacked nature </v>
<v Speaker 3>willy nilly,</v>

2337
02:01:29.560 --> 02:01:34.560
<v Speaker 3>but it's to say we have to have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>realistic context for thinking about </v>

2338
02:01:34.560 --> 02:01:38.491
<v Speaker 3>this and bear in mind that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>environmental movement was born during </v>

2339
02:01:38.531 --> 02:01:40.370
<v Speaker 3>an era of total</v>

2340
02:01:40.610 --> 02:01:43.670
<v Speaker 1>gradual listic dominance in the fifties </v>
<v Speaker 1>and sixties.</v>

2341
02:01:43.671 --> 02:01:46.940
<v Speaker 1>If you go back down again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>only the fringe,</v>

2342
02:01:46.990 --> 02:01:47.400
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2343
02:01:47.401 --> 02:01:48.000
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2344
02:01:48.090 --> 02:01:48.690
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2345
02:01:49.070 --> 02:01:54.070
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fringe science people like vela </v>

2346
02:01:54.070 --> 02:01:54.830
<v Speaker 1>kowski and others were talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>catastrophes.</v>

2347
02:01:55.250 --> 02:01:59.660
<v Speaker 1>The assumption was is that all global </v>
<v Speaker 1>change occurred one grain of sand or one</v>

2348
02:01:59.661 --> 02:02:01.610
<v Speaker 1>drop of water at a time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2349
02:02:02.210 --> 02:02:07.210
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've come a hundred 80 degrees from </v>

2350
02:02:07.210 --> 02:02:10.211
<v Speaker 1>that model of earth history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but our thinking has not really evolved </v>

2351
02:02:10.211 --> 02:02:10.230
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

2352
02:02:10.350 --> 02:02:14.110
<v Speaker 1>to incorporate such a dynamic planet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You knoW,</v>

2353
02:02:14.150 --> 02:02:15.260
<v Speaker 1>at this point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now see,</v>

2354
02:02:15.440 --> 02:02:17.600
<v Speaker 1>so when the environmental movement was </v>
<v Speaker 1>born,</v>

2355
02:02:18.020 --> 02:02:21.060
<v Speaker 1>it was easy to think that if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if all change,</v>

2356
02:02:21.061 --> 02:02:23.600
<v Speaker 1>it had happened at this imperceptibly </v>
<v Speaker 1>slow rate.</v>

2357
02:02:23.980 --> 02:02:28.980
<v Speaker 1>Obviously didn't humans have accelerated</v>
<v Speaker 1>that pace of change and humans are now </v>

2358
02:02:28.980 --> 02:02:30.710
<v Speaker 1>contributing to know more global change </v>
<v Speaker 1>than,</v>

2359
02:02:30.740 --> 02:02:35.740
<v Speaker 1>than we've seen in millions of years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If that uniformitarian undergraduate </v>

2360
02:02:35.740 --> 02:02:38.090
<v Speaker 1>holistic model was correct,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not.</v>

2361
02:02:39.140 --> 02:02:44.140
<v Speaker 1>And I'm afraid that thEre's a large </v>
<v Speaker 1>faction of the environmental movement </v>

2362
02:02:44.140 --> 02:02:47.801
<v Speaker 1>that's still locked into that thinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>of a gradual evolution of the planet.</v>

2363
02:02:49.820 --> 02:02:51.950
<v Speaker 1>One grain of water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one drop of water,</v>

2364
02:02:51.951 --> 02:02:55.940
<v Speaker 1>one grain of sand at a time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that it has not suffered any kind of</v>

2365
02:02:55.941 --> 02:03:00.290
<v Speaker 1>disruption until we bad humans came </v>
<v Speaker 1>along and started,</v>

2366
02:03:00.350 --> 02:03:03.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with our factories and our oil wells and</v>

2367
02:03:03.650 --> 02:03:07.970
<v Speaker 1>our movies and everything else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

2368
02:03:07.971 --> 02:03:12.971
<v Speaker 1>clearly we have to come to terms with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that we live on one hell of a </v>

2369
02:03:12.971 --> 02:03:16.661
<v Speaker 1>dynamic planet in one hell of a dynamic </v>
<v Speaker 1>solar system was a hell of a dying </v>

2370
02:03:16.661 --> 02:03:16.760
<v Speaker 1>without jupiter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2371
02:03:16.761 --> 02:03:18.950
<v Speaker 1>We'd be fucked a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We would be.</v>

2372
02:03:19.110 --> 02:03:22.250
<v Speaker 1>Somebody said they wanted to hear me say</v>
<v Speaker 1>the word fuck at least once.</v>

2373
02:03:24.300 --> 02:03:26.830
<v Speaker 1>So I'll throw out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go ahead and throw it.</v>

2374
02:03:26.840 --> 02:03:27.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we would be fucked.</v>

2375
02:03:27.970 --> 02:03:32.970
<v Speaker 1>Jupiter is the big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of like the bouncer for all the </v>

2376
02:03:32.970 --> 02:03:36.650
<v Speaker 1>bigger asteroids that get sucked into </v>
<v Speaker 1>jupiter can play a dual role.</v>

2377
02:03:37.040 --> 02:03:39.740
<v Speaker 1>See jupiter connect as a as.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2378
02:03:39.800 --> 02:03:43.280
<v Speaker 1>the bouncer that it kicks a lot of those</v>
<v Speaker 1>guys back out,</v>

2379
02:03:43.760 --> 02:03:46.720
<v Speaker 1>back out into the kuyper disk or </v>
<v Speaker 1>wherever they came from or from.</v>

2380
02:03:47.420 --> 02:03:51.500
<v Speaker 1>But it can also hurdle stuff in towards </v>
<v Speaker 1>us.</v>

2381
02:03:51.501 --> 02:03:56.501
<v Speaker 1>It can do either one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sacred geometry is a subject that I </v>

2382
02:03:56.501 --> 02:04:00.401
<v Speaker 1>wanted to talk to you about because we.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We could go on about cataclysmic impacts</v>

2383
02:04:00.800 --> 02:04:05.800
<v Speaker 1>forever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's one of the things that you </v>

2384
02:04:05.800 --> 02:04:07.601
<v Speaker 1>mentioned at the end of our last podcast</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you wanted to talk about on this </v>

2385
02:04:07.601 --> 02:04:10.910
<v Speaker 1>one and it's the name of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>organization.</v>

2386
02:04:10.940 --> 02:04:12.140
<v Speaker 1>Sacred geometry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2387
02:04:12.141 --> 02:04:14.650
<v Speaker 1>it's the name of the website.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2388
02:04:15.170 --> 02:04:17.360
<v Speaker 1>I could find some stuff here to show you</v>
<v Speaker 1>about that.</v>

2389
02:04:17.361 --> 02:04:18.960
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it dovetails because bayer,</v>

2390
02:04:19.400 --> 02:04:21.890
<v Speaker 1>remember we're talking here a lot about </v>
<v Speaker 1>geology,</v>

2391
02:04:22.490 --> 02:04:24.140
<v Speaker 1>geometry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2392
02:04:24.141 --> 02:04:27.920
<v Speaker 1>They both are sciences that have evolved</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of the study of the earth.</v>

2393
02:04:28.640 --> 02:04:30.500
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2394
02:04:30.570 --> 02:04:33.590
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that I've done is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is in geology.</v>

2395
02:04:33.591 --> 02:04:35.660
<v Speaker 1>We have this thing called scale and </v>
<v Speaker 1>variance,</v>

2396
02:04:36.230 --> 02:04:38.280
<v Speaker 1>which is that if you're looking a </v>
<v Speaker 1>geological picture,</v>

2397
02:04:38.520 --> 02:04:43.520
<v Speaker 3>you're always gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See somebody you're going to see like a </v>

2398
02:04:43.520 --> 02:04:46.551
<v Speaker 3>rock pick set in the picture,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to see a person standing </v>

2399
02:04:46.551 --> 02:04:50.481
<v Speaker 3>there because oftentimes you don't have </v>
<v Speaker 3>a sense of the scale of what you're </v>

2400
02:04:50.481 --> 02:04:50.481
<v Speaker 3>looking at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2401
02:04:50.481 --> 02:04:54.830
<v Speaker 3>If,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and in geometry we have the same </v>

2402
02:04:54.830 --> 02:04:55.710
<v Speaker 3>phenomena.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's also kind of the modern term for it</v>

2403
02:04:55.711 --> 02:04:59.010
<v Speaker 3>is fractal association where the part </v>
<v Speaker 3>looks,</v>

2404
02:04:59.040 --> 02:05:01.110
<v Speaker 3>the smaller part looks like the bigger </v>
<v Speaker 3>whole.</v>

2405
02:05:01.111 --> 02:05:06.111
<v Speaker 3>And that's one of the basic working </v>
<v Speaker 3>ideas of sacred geometry and it's the </v>

2406
02:05:06.111 --> 02:05:11.001
<v Speaker 3>same idea of what I was describing </v>
<v Speaker 3>standing there looking into the </v>

2407
02:05:11.001 --> 02:05:14.230
<v Speaker 3>Minnesota river valley.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This was an example of scale in variance</v>

2408
02:05:14.310 --> 02:05:18.300
<v Speaker 3>that you had the same,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the big channel was just a much,</v>

2409
02:05:18.301 --> 02:05:20.730
<v Speaker 3>much larger version of this small </v>
<v Speaker 3>channel.</v>

2410
02:05:21.120 --> 02:05:23.280
<v Speaker 3>And if you didn't have a scale of </v>
<v Speaker 3>reference,</v>

2411
02:05:23.460 --> 02:05:25.860
<v Speaker 3>you couldn't tell really what you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>looking at,</v>

2412
02:05:25.861 --> 02:05:27.600
<v Speaker 3>how,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how big or how small it is.</v>

2413
02:05:27.600 --> 02:05:30.750
<v Speaker 3>See.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So in the study of sacred geometry,</v>

2414
02:05:30.751 --> 02:05:33.960
<v Speaker 3>one of the fundamental ideas is this </v>
<v Speaker 3>idea of scale and variance.</v>

2415
02:05:33.961 --> 02:05:37.200
<v Speaker 3>So when I first was interested in </v>
<v Speaker 3>geometry,</v>

2416
02:05:37.260 --> 02:05:42.260
<v Speaker 3>because geometry I think is one of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>keys to decipher in many of the ancient </v>

2417
02:05:42.260 --> 02:05:43.650
<v Speaker 3>traditions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>LIke you know,</v>

2418
02:05:43.651 --> 02:05:48.651
<v Speaker 3>I became a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Somebody wanted me to talk about </v>

2419
02:05:48.651 --> 02:05:48.900
<v Speaker 3>freemasonry and I can talk about that up</v>
<v Speaker 3>to a certain extent.</v>

2420
02:05:50.110 --> 02:05:53.760
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that I learned as soon</v>

2421
02:05:53.761 --> 02:05:58.761
<v Speaker 3>as I actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I learned it before I was </v>

2422
02:05:58.761 --> 02:06:00.381
<v Speaker 3>actually initiated into the masonic </v>
<v Speaker 3>fraternity in 1978 was that at the core </v>

2423
02:06:01.201 --> 02:06:03.570
<v Speaker 3>of all of the masonic symbolism was </v>
<v Speaker 3>geometry.</v>

2424
02:06:04.230 --> 02:06:07.350
<v Speaker 3>If you wanted to understand the message </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the great cathedrals,</v>

2425
02:06:07.770 --> 02:06:11.060
<v Speaker 3>you had to have geometry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you wanted to understand the,</v>

2426
02:06:11.061 --> 02:06:11.630
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2427
02:06:11.710 --> 02:06:16.710
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this amazing plethora of symbolism that </v>

2428
02:06:16.710 --> 02:06:20.001
<v Speaker 3>has of which masons are the custodians.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You had to study geometry and </v>

2429
02:06:20.821 --> 02:06:25.821
<v Speaker 3>secondarily you had to study astronomy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that sort of confirmed some of the </v>

2430
02:06:25.821 --> 02:06:29.030
<v Speaker 3>ideas I had already been thinking at the</v>
<v Speaker 3>time that I went in in the,</v>

2431
02:06:29.050 --> 02:06:30.180
<v Speaker 3>in the late seventies.</v>

2432
02:06:31.290 --> 02:06:35.530
<v Speaker 3>Freemasonry is full of symbolism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why did you join the freemasons?</v>

2433
02:06:35.950 --> 02:06:37.710
<v Speaker 3>Well know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because for one thing,</v>

2434
02:06:37.890 --> 02:06:40.530
<v Speaker 3>I've always loved you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I come from a family of builders.</v>

2435
02:06:41.010 --> 02:06:43.140
<v Speaker 3>I build things for a living.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I do.</v>

2436
02:06:43.320 --> 02:06:45.360
<v Speaker 3>I design things and build things for a </v>
<v Speaker 3>living.</v>

2437
02:06:45.420 --> 02:06:46.890
<v Speaker 3>That's what I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How I make my money.</v>

2438
02:06:47.310 --> 02:06:52.310
<v Speaker 3>So I was always interested in the built </v>
<v Speaker 3>environment and somewhere along the line</v>

2439
02:06:52.441 --> 02:06:57.441
<v Speaker 3>I just began to realize that there was a</v>
<v Speaker 3>whole lot more to the built environment </v>

2440
02:06:57.441 --> 02:07:00.951
<v Speaker 3>of ancient times that in modern times </v>
<v Speaker 3>you look at architecture in that </v>

2441
02:07:01.171 --> 02:07:06.171
<v Speaker 3>architecture is not necessarily </v>
<v Speaker 3>symbolical except on a very abstract </v>

2442
02:07:06.301 --> 02:07:11.301
<v Speaker 3>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I became aware of the fact that the </v>

2443
02:07:11.301 --> 02:07:11.301
<v Speaker 3>ancient architecture,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ancient structures,</v>

2444
02:07:11.301 --> 02:07:14.020
<v Speaker 3>whether it's the pyramids of giza or </v>
<v Speaker 3>stonehenge or angkor wat,</v>

2445
02:07:14.021 --> 02:07:18.720
<v Speaker 3>are the mayan temples.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are all profoundly symbolic.</v>

2446
02:07:19.410 --> 02:07:22.050
<v Speaker 3>They're not just built because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

2447
02:07:22.110 --> 02:07:23.340
<v Speaker 3>it looks good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2448
02:07:23.430 --> 02:07:25.980
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they convey information.</v>

2449
02:07:26.600 --> 02:07:27.750
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2450
02:07:27.751 --> 02:07:29.400
<v Speaker 3>cathedrals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was victor hugo who,</v>

2451
02:07:29.401 --> 02:07:33.330
<v Speaker 3>who referred to some of the great </v>
<v Speaker 3>cathedrals as being literal textbooks in</v>

2452
02:07:33.331 --> 02:07:36.460
<v Speaker 3>stone and that's what they are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sharp cathedral,</v>

2453
02:07:36.760 --> 02:07:39.040
<v Speaker 1>beautiful example of a textbook and </v>
<v Speaker 1>stone.</v>

2454
02:07:39.520 --> 02:07:40.900
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

2455
02:07:41.560 --> 02:07:46.560
<v Speaker 1>I have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you've ever been to any </v>

2456
02:07:46.560 --> 02:07:47.920
<v Speaker 1>of the cathedral that that's something </v>
<v Speaker 1>you need to put on your bucket list.</v>

2457
02:07:47.921 --> 02:07:52.921
<v Speaker 1>Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm planning on going to europe this </v>

2458
02:07:52.921 --> 02:07:55.920
<v Speaker 1>summer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so when I do on a vacation instead of </v>

2459
02:07:55.920 --> 02:07:55.920
<v Speaker 1>working.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2460
02:07:55.920 --> 02:07:55.920
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2461
02:07:56.080 --> 02:07:58.780
<v Speaker 1>make it a research vacation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It will make a lot more interesting.</v>

2462
02:07:58.781 --> 02:08:00.550
<v Speaker 1>And maria,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go have kids.</v>

2463
02:08:00.670 --> 02:08:05.670
<v Speaker 1>It's tough to do a lot of research.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've got little kids get bored real </v>

2464
02:08:05.670 --> 02:08:05.670
<v Speaker 1>easy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm going to check some shit out.</v>

2465
02:08:05.740 --> 02:08:06.780
<v Speaker 1>Checks and shit out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2466
02:08:06.790 --> 02:08:11.020
<v Speaker 1>and I can send you some places that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know about your kids,</v>

2467
02:08:11.021 --> 02:08:13.870
<v Speaker 1>but I could easily have been eight years</v>
<v Speaker 1>old and been totally blown away by.</v>

2468
02:08:14.850 --> 02:08:17.840
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things about the freemasons,</v>

2469
02:08:18.040 --> 02:08:23.040
<v Speaker 1>the idea of the free masons is that it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>a secret society and this a secret,</v>

2470
02:08:23.520 --> 02:08:28.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and people associated with the </v>

2471
02:08:28.520 --> 02:08:29.560
<v Speaker 1>illuminati and the people that control </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world and don't.</v>

2472
02:08:29.560 --> 02:08:32.360
<v Speaker 1>I wish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But no,</v>

2473
02:08:32.950 --> 02:08:36.430
<v Speaker 1>I think I would love to be the dick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dick supreme dictator of the world.</v>

2474
02:08:36.700 --> 02:08:38.560
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would you do differently?</v>

2475
02:08:39.070 --> 02:08:41.910
<v Speaker 1>Differently?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We could get into.</v>

2476
02:08:41.940 --> 02:08:42.700
<v Speaker 1>That's going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2477
02:08:42.701 --> 02:08:45.120
<v Speaker 1>that's a five hour body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's a different podcast.</v>

2478
02:08:45.520 --> 02:08:50.520
<v Speaker 1>But the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when you say like I'm a mason,</v>

2479
02:08:51.040 --> 02:08:52.700
<v Speaker 1>people would automatically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2480
02:08:52.720 --> 02:08:57.720
<v Speaker 1>especially ignorant people would </v>
<v Speaker 1>automatically assume that you're a part </v>

2481
02:08:57.720 --> 02:09:00.901
<v Speaker 1>of some sort of society that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>victimizing the general population and </v>

2482
02:09:01.451 --> 02:09:06.010
<v Speaker 1>you're involved with the people that put</v>
<v Speaker 1>the eyeball on top of the pyramid that's</v>

2483
02:09:06.011 --> 02:09:09.430
<v Speaker 1>on the dollar bill and your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2484
02:09:09.431 --> 02:09:11.050
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know where to start with </v>
<v Speaker 1>some of that.</v>

2485
02:09:11.220 --> 02:09:16.220
<v Speaker 1>Are there secrets in the freemasons </v>
<v Speaker 1>where you're not allowed to talk about </v>

2486
02:09:16.220 --> 02:09:16.220
<v Speaker 1>it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2487
02:09:16.220 --> 02:09:19.120
<v Speaker 1>bear in mind now secrets in in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>middle ages,</v>

2488
02:09:19.150 --> 02:09:23.500
<v Speaker 1>there were trade secrets and building </v>
<v Speaker 1>secrets.</v>

2489
02:09:23.530 --> 02:09:24.410
<v Speaker 1>Clearly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2490
02:09:25.690 --> 02:09:28.510
<v Speaker 1>and when you went through the process of</v>
<v Speaker 1>initiation,</v>

2491
02:09:28.511 --> 02:09:30.580
<v Speaker 1>you learned about these secrets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2492
02:09:30.910 --> 02:09:35.910
<v Speaker 1>But it's not that really that different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea than say modern commercial or </v>

2493
02:09:37.091 --> 02:09:38.560
<v Speaker 1>industrial secrets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2494
02:09:38.561 --> 02:09:41.400
<v Speaker 1>coke has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it keeps it formula secret.</v>

2495
02:09:41.470 --> 02:09:41.890
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2496
02:09:41.900 --> 02:09:46.900
<v Speaker 1>And has done so for 100 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the thing was is you got to realize </v>

2497
02:09:47.470 --> 02:09:52.470
<v Speaker 1>that freemasonry became an outlawed </v>
<v Speaker 1>organization right during the middle </v>

2498
02:09:52.720 --> 02:09:57.160
<v Speaker 1>ages when the church was persecuting </v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody who was branded a heretic,</v>

2499
02:09:57.190 --> 02:10:00.970
<v Speaker 1>which could have meant anything that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they wanted to be free.</v>

2500
02:10:00.971 --> 02:10:05.971
<v Speaker 1>Masonry had to go underground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the primary reason for the </v>

2501
02:10:05.971 --> 02:10:10.471
<v Speaker 1>secrecy is because it was a survival </v>
<v Speaker 1>strategy and it only reemerged in nearly</v>

2502
02:10:12.161 --> 02:10:17.161
<v Speaker 1>1700 with the consolidation of four </v>
<v Speaker 1>lodges in britain to become the modern </v>

2503
02:10:17.381 --> 02:10:19.870
<v Speaker 1>institution freemason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

2504
02:10:19.930 --> 02:10:21.940
<v Speaker 1>to anybody who comes up with that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would just challenge him,</v>

2505
02:10:21.941 --> 02:10:23.530
<v Speaker 1>show me the hard evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>show me that,</v>

2506
02:10:23.560 --> 02:10:24.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like to say that.</v>

2507
02:10:24.941 --> 02:10:25.300
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2508
02:10:25.301 --> 02:10:26.290
<v Speaker 1>I'll admit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2509
02:10:26.291 --> 02:10:29.380
<v Speaker 1>14 of the american presidents have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>free masons,</v>

2510
02:10:29.620 --> 02:10:33.800
<v Speaker 1>but 22 of them were episcopalians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So clearly that implies me that it's the</v>

2511
02:10:33.801 --> 02:10:34.760
<v Speaker 1>episcopalians</v>

2512
02:10:34.760 --> 02:10:36.860
<v Speaker 3>who are the puppet masters ruling the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world,</v>

2513
02:10:36.950 --> 02:10:39.410
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you want to make that argument,</v>

2514
02:10:39.920 --> 02:10:41.750
<v Speaker 3>well why were they freemasons?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2515
02:10:41.751 --> 02:10:43.610
<v Speaker 3>what's the benefits of being a </v>
<v Speaker 3>freemason?</v>

2516
02:10:43.910 --> 02:10:45.530
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for one thing,</v>

2517
02:10:45.531 --> 02:10:50.531
<v Speaker 3>what you're doing is you're aligning </v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself with probably the oldest </v>

2518
02:10:50.531 --> 02:10:53.861
<v Speaker 3>institution.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It still exists on the planet that goes </v>

2519
02:10:53.861 --> 02:10:54.110
<v Speaker 3>back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now we can historically trace it back to</v>

2520
02:10:54.111 --> 02:10:59.111
<v Speaker 3>the middle ages.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you go back further than that </v>

2521
02:10:59.111 --> 02:11:01.070
<v Speaker 3>wild,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the historical continuity breaks down.</v>

2522
02:11:01.460 --> 02:11:03.870
<v Speaker 3>We can go back and we can talk about the</v>
<v Speaker 3>coma.</v>

2523
02:11:03.880 --> 02:11:06.730
<v Speaker 3>Chines and Italy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can talk about the martin lists,</v>

2524
02:11:06.740 --> 02:11:08.020
<v Speaker 3>we can talk about the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2525
02:11:08.900 --> 02:11:13.900
<v Speaker 3>the myth reyes tradition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can talk about the mysteries of </v>

2526
02:11:13.900 --> 02:11:13.900
<v Speaker 3>Egypt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2527
02:11:13.900 --> 02:11:16.670
<v Speaker 3>we can talk about the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the zoroastrian tradition.</v>

2528
02:11:16.950 --> 02:11:18.470
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the list goes on,</v>

2529
02:11:18.471 --> 02:11:23.471
<v Speaker 3>the loc and mysteries.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what we see is a structure of </v>

2530
02:11:23.471 --> 02:11:26.681
<v Speaker 3>initiation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's virtually identical in all these </v>

2531
02:11:26.681 --> 02:11:26.681
<v Speaker 3>cases to what modern freemasonry is.</v>

2532
02:11:27.080 --> 02:11:30.830
<v Speaker 3>And I'm with modern freemasonry </v>
<v Speaker 3>basically,</v>

2533
02:11:31.280 --> 02:11:36.280
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have a whole cross section of </v>

2534
02:11:36.280 --> 02:11:37.760
<v Speaker 3>individuals that join who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who a lot of them joined simply because,</v>

2535
02:11:37.761 --> 02:11:39.350
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my dad was a freemason,</v>

2536
02:11:39.410 --> 02:11:41.120
<v Speaker 3>or my uncle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a family tradition.</v>

2537
02:11:41.600 --> 02:11:45.260
<v Speaker 3>So that's why I joined.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Others joined because free masons raised</v>

2538
02:11:45.280 --> 02:11:47.690
<v Speaker 3>every year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>raised millions of dollars for charity,</v>

2539
02:11:47.750 --> 02:11:51.590
<v Speaker 3>mostly for children's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a charitable causes,</v>

2540
02:11:51.591 --> 02:11:56.591
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they run the scottish rite hospital for </v>

2541
02:11:56.591 --> 02:11:57.740
<v Speaker 3>crippled children.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They run I hospitals and you know,</v>

2542
02:11:57.830 --> 02:12:02.830
<v Speaker 3>children that need medical care,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can go to these hospitals and not </v>

2543
02:12:02.830 --> 02:12:06.290
<v Speaker 3>have to pay anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they're fraternal organization or one</v>

2544
02:12:06.291 --> 02:12:09.740
<v Speaker 3>of the largest charitable organizations </v>
<v Speaker 3>on the planet in terms of the money that</v>

2545
02:12:09.741 --> 02:12:10.940
<v Speaker 3>they raised.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2546
02:12:11.360 --> 02:12:12.920
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>jesus said by their,</v>

2547
02:12:13.010 --> 02:12:14.660
<v Speaker 3>by their works,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you shall know them.</v>

2548
02:12:14.900 --> 02:12:16.060
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2549
02:12:17.180 --> 02:12:19.040
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can twist that around,</v>

2550
02:12:19.130 --> 02:12:21.260
<v Speaker 3>perversely,</v>
<v Speaker 3>twist that around and say that some kind</v>

2551
02:12:21.261 --> 02:12:23.290
<v Speaker 3>of nefarious strategy to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2552
02:12:23.350 --> 02:12:24.380
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get control.</v>

2553
02:12:24.920 --> 02:12:29.920
<v Speaker 3>The other side of the equation is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're also custodians of this body of </v>

2554
02:12:29.920 --> 02:12:34.060
<v Speaker 3>ancient symbolism were all of these </v>
<v Speaker 3>things that we have been talking about </v>

2555
02:12:34.490 --> 02:12:36.810
<v Speaker 3>basically are encoded.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2556
02:12:37.300 --> 02:12:38.010
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

2557
02:12:38.020 --> 02:12:40.580
<v Speaker 3>and I could pull up some interesting </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff here.</v>

2558
02:12:40.610 --> 02:12:45.610
<v Speaker 3>Did you know that you could look at to </v>
<v Speaker 3>see what we're actually talking about </v>

2559
02:12:46.311 --> 02:12:46.790
<v Speaker 3>there?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

2560
02:12:46.910 --> 02:12:51.910
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have this amazing body of </v>

2561
02:12:51.910 --> 02:12:51.910
<v Speaker 3>symbolism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me,</v>

2562
02:12:51.910 --> 02:12:55.840
<v Speaker 3>let me pull it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's how big an example of a masonic </v>

2563
02:12:55.840 --> 02:12:55.840
<v Speaker 3>apron.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

2564
02:12:55.840 --> 02:12:57.650
<v Speaker 3>let's take a look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll zoom in here.</v>

2565
02:12:58.700 --> 02:13:02.720
<v Speaker 3>And what do you see right at the very </v>
<v Speaker 3>center of this symbol?</v>

2566
02:13:02.750 --> 02:13:04.630
<v Speaker 3>Symbolical array.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you,</v>

2567
02:13:04.670 --> 02:13:07.970
<v Speaker 3>what is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a barn.</v>

2568
02:13:08.270 --> 02:13:10.610
<v Speaker 3>It's not a bar of the ark,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ark,</v>

2569
02:13:11.140 --> 02:13:11.530
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2570
02:13:11.540 --> 02:13:13.580
<v Speaker 3>it's probably a noah's ark of noah's </v>
<v Speaker 3>ark.</v>

2571
02:13:13.640 --> 02:13:18.640
<v Speaker 3>So that's the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's supposed to be the ocean </v>

2572
02:13:18.640 --> 02:13:18.890
<v Speaker 3>around it and it's floating in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>waters of the great flood.</v>

2573
02:13:19.040 --> 02:13:20.360
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and if you look closely,</v>

2574
02:13:20.361 --> 02:13:22.400
<v Speaker 3>I know it's hard to tell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but growing out of here,</v>

2575
02:13:22.460 --> 02:13:25.040
<v Speaker 3>that's a chicken.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's an acacia?</v>

2576
02:13:25.670 --> 02:13:30.670
<v Speaker 3>The acacia has impatient bush,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a masonic symbol for rebirth </v>

2577
02:13:30.670 --> 02:13:31.770
<v Speaker 3>regeneration,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rejuvenation.</v>

2578
02:13:32.070 --> 02:13:36.810
<v Speaker 4>So the idea here is that iN that arch is</v>
<v Speaker 4>preserved all of the seeds,</v>

2579
02:13:36.811 --> 02:13:41.130
<v Speaker 4>the bIological diversity of the world </v>
<v Speaker 4>that is now being erased from the planet</v>

2580
02:13:41.160 --> 02:13:43.350
<v Speaker 4>by the waters of the flood,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the acacia.</v>

2581
02:13:43.410 --> 02:13:48.410
<v Speaker 4>Is it related to the acacia tree or the </v>
<v Speaker 4>case of bushes at the same sort of </v>

2582
02:13:48.410 --> 02:13:48.410
<v Speaker 4>thing?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2583
02:13:48.410 --> 02:13:52.760
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the same bush that they believe </v>

2584
02:13:52.760 --> 02:13:53.970
<v Speaker 4>was responsible for moses having the </v>
<v Speaker 4>visions of god.</v>

2585
02:13:54.890 --> 02:13:59.890
<v Speaker 4>So what are they giving him the 10 </v>
<v Speaker 4>commandments because the acacia bushes </v>

2586
02:13:59.890 --> 02:14:01.460
<v Speaker 4>rich and dimethyltryptamine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ah,</v>

2587
02:14:01.560 --> 02:14:05.940
<v Speaker 4>the flaming bush,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the being symbolic of somehow or another</v>

2588
02:14:05.941 --> 02:14:10.941
<v Speaker 4>extracting the dmt from that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>smoking it or lighting it on fire.</v>

2589
02:14:11.850 --> 02:14:15.120
<v Speaker 4>And that being the transmission method </v>
<v Speaker 4>for the dimethyltryptamine,</v>

2590
02:14:15.121 --> 02:14:20.121
<v Speaker 4>which of course is one of the most </v>
<v Speaker 4>profound psychedelic experiences and </v>

2591
02:14:20.121 --> 02:14:22.950
<v Speaker 4>gives people this feeling of being in </v>
<v Speaker 4>contact with the divine.</v>

2592
02:14:23.460 --> 02:14:28.460
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you think it's any coincidence that </v>

2593
02:14:28.460 --> 02:14:29.550
<v Speaker 4>the freemasons have venerated the acacia</v>
<v Speaker 4>for hundreds of years?</v>

2594
02:14:29.570 --> 02:14:31.320
<v Speaker 4>It makes a lot of sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Makes a lot of sense,</v>

2595
02:14:31.321 --> 02:14:32.140
<v Speaker 4>doesn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2596
02:14:32.430 --> 02:14:33.180
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2597
02:14:33.181 --> 02:14:38.181
<v Speaker 4>there's modern day scholars who are </v>
<v Speaker 4>looking at the story of moses and </v>

2598
02:14:38.181 --> 02:14:40.110
<v Speaker 4>connecting it to some sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 4>psychedelic trip.</v>

2599
02:14:40.470 --> 02:14:42.530
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here is,</v>

2600
02:14:42.890 --> 02:14:46.710
<v Speaker 4>which is another thing that's slowly </v>
<v Speaker 4>being exonerated today.</v>

2601
02:14:46.711 --> 02:14:49.530
<v Speaker 4>Those ideas are being vindicated today.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2602
02:14:49.531 --> 02:14:50.910
<v Speaker 4>way that before,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2603
02:14:50.911 --> 02:14:55.911
<v Speaker 4>you would say just a few decades ago </v>
<v Speaker 4>that somehow or another moses was on </v>

2604
02:14:55.911 --> 02:14:55.911
<v Speaker 4>drugs and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>get the fuck out of here.</v>

2605
02:14:55.911 --> 02:14:57.360
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think people would just.</v>

2606
02:14:57.430 --> 02:15:02.430
<v Speaker 4>And any real,</v>
<v Speaker 4>legitimate sort of stories being </v>

2607
02:15:02.430 --> 02:15:07.251
<v Speaker 4>connected to psychedelic drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people would think of as being </v>

2608
02:15:07.251 --> 02:15:09.921
<v Speaker 4>preposterous and now and now worn more </v>
<v Speaker 4>accepted every day simply because the </v>

2609
02:15:10.111 --> 02:15:12.730
<v Speaker 4>evidence has accumulated overwhelming </v>
<v Speaker 4>the elephant there.</v>

2610
02:15:12.731 --> 02:15:14.850
<v Speaker 4>There's no question that in the llc and </v>
<v Speaker 4>mysteries,</v>

2611
02:15:14.851 --> 02:15:18.300
<v Speaker 4>they were imbibing some type of a </v>
<v Speaker 4>consciousness altering substance.</v>

2612
02:15:18.301 --> 02:15:21.300
<v Speaker 4>I think that there's no question during </v>
<v Speaker 4>the mithraic mysteries also.</v>

2613
02:15:21.330 --> 02:15:24.540
<v Speaker 4>They were,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't know what that was though,</v>

2614
02:15:24.541 --> 02:15:25.560
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not exactly.</v>

2615
02:15:25.561 --> 02:15:26.370
<v Speaker 4>Unless you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2616
02:15:26.371 --> 02:15:27.590
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2617
02:15:27.630 --> 02:15:32.630
<v Speaker 4>who was it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe Albert Hoffman and a couple </v>

2618
02:15:32.630 --> 02:15:32.630
<v Speaker 4>others,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

2619
02:15:32.630 --> 02:15:35.261
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they wrote a book in the seventies on </v>

2620
02:15:35.261 --> 02:15:35.580
<v Speaker 4>the loc and mysteries where they were </v>
<v Speaker 4>talking about that.</v>

2621
02:15:35.581 --> 02:15:39.780
<v Speaker 4>And I read it so long ago,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've kind of forgotten what their,</v>

2622
02:15:40.230 --> 02:15:45.230
<v Speaker 4>what their final conclusion was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it was definitely that they were </v>

2623
02:15:45.230 --> 02:15:46.140
<v Speaker 4>doing some type of a psychedelic potion </v>
<v Speaker 4>will even soma.</v>

2624
02:15:46.200 --> 02:15:51.200
<v Speaker 4>When you go back to the ancient hindus,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the soma being some sort of a mystery </v>

2625
02:15:51.900 --> 02:15:53.820
<v Speaker 4>concoction,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't know what it was,</v>

2626
02:15:53.821 --> 02:15:57.830
<v Speaker 4>but most likely had some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 4>psychedelic properties to.</v>

2627
02:15:57.850 --> 02:16:00.150
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't know exactly what.</v>

2628
02:16:00.151 --> 02:16:04.950
<v Speaker 4>It was amazing when you consider the </v>
<v Speaker 4>fact that this stuff was so profound,</v>

2629
02:16:04.951 --> 02:16:09.951
<v Speaker 4>so important to them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and now we don't even know what was in </v>

2630
02:16:09.951 --> 02:16:13.221
<v Speaker 4>it and most likely some concoction with </v>
<v Speaker 4>probably included psychedelic mushrooms.</v>

2631
02:16:14.400 --> 02:16:17.430
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well I'm convinced that one of the,</v>

2632
02:16:18.040 --> 02:16:21.180
<v Speaker 4>one of the great boons to humankind is </v>
<v Speaker 4>psychedelics.</v>

2633
02:16:21.600 --> 02:16:26.600
<v Speaker 4>And it was a profound mistake to </v>
<v Speaker 4>criminalize it when we should have </v>

2634
02:16:26.600 --> 02:16:29.800
<v Speaker 4>venerated as ancient cultures did and </v>
<v Speaker 4>provided a context in which people could</v>

2635
02:16:29.801 --> 02:16:31.750
<v Speaker 4>do it with wisdom,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2636
02:16:31.751 --> 02:16:34.570
<v Speaker 4>and propriety rather than driving it </v>
<v Speaker 4>underground,</v>

2637
02:16:34.571 --> 02:16:39.571
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and turning it into a criminal </v>

2638
02:16:39.571 --> 02:16:41.191
<v Speaker 4>enterprise that has been,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think enormously had enormously </v>

2639
02:16:41.191 --> 02:16:42.280
<v Speaker 4>destructive consequences for our society</v>
<v Speaker 4>by,</v>

2640
02:16:42.340 --> 02:16:44.680
<v Speaker 4>by criminalizing this for the last half </v>
<v Speaker 4>century.</v>

2641
02:16:44.860 --> 02:16:46.000
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>most certainly.</v>

2642
02:16:46.001 --> 02:16:48.610
<v Speaker 4>And you can see the difference in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>art of the 19 sixties,</v>

2643
02:16:48.611 --> 02:16:53.611
<v Speaker 4>especially when it comes to music,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the difference between the sixties and </v>

2644
02:16:53.611 --> 02:16:56.461
<v Speaker 4>the seventies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that shallow nature of a lot of the </v>

2645
02:16:56.461 --> 02:16:57.190
<v Speaker 4>music that came out of the seven days in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the disco and all that stuff.</v>

2646
02:16:57.340 --> 02:17:02.340
<v Speaker 4>And then look at what was going on in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the sixties with hendrix and jim </v>

2647
02:17:02.340 --> 02:17:03.970
<v Speaker 4>morrison,</v>
<v Speaker 4>most likely psychedelic related.</v>

2648
02:17:04.020 --> 02:17:05.230
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of course it was.</v>

2649
02:17:05.400 --> 02:17:06.130
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of course.</v>

2650
02:17:06.400 --> 02:17:07.750
<v Speaker 4>Led zeppelin,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the beatles.</v>

2651
02:17:08.110 --> 02:17:10.000
<v Speaker 4>The profound change in the music of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>beatles.</v>

2652
02:17:10.001 --> 02:17:15.001
<v Speaker 4>once they discovered lsd,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it inspired an enormous burst of </v>

2653
02:17:15.161 --> 02:17:17.390
<v Speaker 4>creativity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's really interesting.</v>

2654
02:17:17.410 --> 02:17:22.410
<v Speaker 4>Then what we're seeing now is huge </v>
<v Speaker 4>benefits in psychedelic therapy for </v>

2655
02:17:22.410 --> 02:17:24.150
<v Speaker 4>people with posttraumatic stress </v>
<v Speaker 4>disorder,</v>

2656
02:17:24.151 --> 02:17:29.151
<v Speaker 4>ice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's out of war that we're finding </v>

2657
02:17:29.151 --> 02:17:32.680
<v Speaker 4>these therapies for people that went to </v>
<v Speaker 4>war and these therapies,</v>

2658
02:17:32.681 --> 02:17:36.610
<v Speaker 4>the best ones are psychedelics,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is really amazing.</v>

2659
02:17:36.611 --> 02:17:37.030
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2660
02:17:37.031 --> 02:17:38.160
<v Speaker 4>in my own case,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2661
02:17:38.220 --> 02:17:43.220
<v Speaker 4>I basically went from being a juvenile </v>
<v Speaker 4>delinquent to the quest for god in one </v>

2662
02:17:43.931 --> 02:17:48.931
<v Speaker 4>weekend after my first basically.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So wow It was that,</v>

2663
02:17:51.400 --> 02:17:54.280
<v Speaker 4>that quick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of people have at the same story.</v>

2664
02:17:54.281 --> 02:17:56.440
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>terence mckenna spoke of his,</v>

2665
02:17:56.620 --> 02:17:59.080
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of his trips to the jungle,</v>

2666
02:17:59.230 --> 02:18:01.150
<v Speaker 4>being that he was this sort of </v>
<v Speaker 4>narrative,</v>

2667
02:18:01.151 --> 02:18:02.860
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just couldn't get it together.</v>

2668
02:18:02.920 --> 02:18:05.320
<v Speaker 4>and then he came out of it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the psychedelic shaman.</v>

2669
02:18:05.560 --> 02:18:08.110
<v Speaker 4>I had this intense desire to spread the </v>
<v Speaker 4>word.</v>

2670
02:18:08.140 --> 02:18:09.550
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2671
02:18:09.950 --> 02:18:11.230
<v Speaker 4>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

2672
02:18:11.500 --> 02:18:16.500
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I think we're definitely moving in </v>

2673
02:18:16.500 --> 02:18:16.500
<v Speaker 4>the right direction.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>

2674
02:18:16.500 --> 02:18:16.570
<v Speaker 4>it's of course,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2675
02:18:17.110 --> 02:18:18.460
<v Speaker 4>for me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm impatient.</v>

2676
02:18:18.461 --> 02:18:23.461
<v Speaker 4>I want to see you move a lot faster.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to see us just end this </v>

2677
02:18:23.461 --> 02:18:24.240
<v Speaker 4>ridiculous drug war,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

2678
02:18:24.310 --> 02:18:25.080
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and yeah,</v>

2679
02:18:25.150 --> 02:18:26.890
<v Speaker 4>of course there's going to be a downside</v>
<v Speaker 4>to it.</v>

2680
02:18:26.891 --> 02:18:28.720
<v Speaker 4>There's downsides to everything,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>

2681
02:18:28.740 --> 02:18:31.670
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the upside is so substantial.</v>

2682
02:18:31.700 --> 02:18:36.700
<v Speaker 4>Upside is so substantial.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the downside of it is minuscule </v>

2683
02:18:36.700 --> 02:18:37.600
<v Speaker 4>compared to the downside of the drug war</v>
<v Speaker 4>itself.</v>

2684
02:18:37.720 --> 02:18:40.960
<v Speaker 4>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how about the drugs that we already have</v>

2685
02:18:40.961 --> 02:18:43.810
<v Speaker 4>that are legal to the drugs that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>sanctioned or the worst one?</v>

2686
02:18:43.811 --> 02:18:44.830
<v Speaker 4>Worst ones.</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

2687
02:18:45.120 --> 02:18:48.310
<v Speaker 4>Just we're not going to have a drug free</v>
<v Speaker 4>society.</v>

2688
02:18:48.310 --> 02:18:51.790
<v Speaker 4>I've had Dr.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Carl Hart on the podcast who's an expert</v>

2689
02:18:51.791 --> 02:18:56.791
<v Speaker 4>in this and is written some pretty </v>
<v Speaker 4>amazing stuff on it and one of the </v>

2690
02:18:56.791 --> 02:19:01.090
<v Speaker 4>things he said is not only do we not </v>
<v Speaker 4>want a drug free culture,</v>

2691
02:19:01.210 --> 02:19:06.210
<v Speaker 4>we've never had one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No one has ever had an idea of a drug </v>

2692
02:19:06.210 --> 02:19:07.150
<v Speaker 4>free culture.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They've never existed.</v>

2693
02:19:07.720 --> 02:19:11.890
<v Speaker 4>Once people figured out a way to perturb</v>
<v Speaker 4>their normal states of conscious and the</v>

2694
02:19:11.891 --> 02:19:16.891
<v Speaker 4>benefits of that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether it's alcohol or psychedelics or </v>

2695
02:19:16.891 --> 02:19:16.990
<v Speaker 4>whatever it's been.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even yoga and meditation,</v>

2696
02:19:16.991 --> 02:19:18.520
<v Speaker 4>you're essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

2697
02:19:18.521 --> 02:19:21.130
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're stimulating indogenous drugs.</v>

2698
02:19:21.131 --> 02:19:21.950
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

2699
02:19:21.980 --> 02:19:22.350
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

2700
02:19:22.351 --> 02:19:23.380
<v Speaker 4>and see,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's the thing.</v>

2701
02:19:23.590 --> 02:19:25.570
<v Speaker 4>Somebody brought this up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't remember who.</v>

2702
02:19:25.571 --> 02:19:28.130
<v Speaker 4>It might've been somebody like richard </v>
<v Speaker 4>or something back</v>

2703
02:19:28.130 --> 02:19:29.600
<v Speaker 1>in the day saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2704
02:19:29.810 --> 02:19:34.810
<v Speaker 1>you can go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can embark on a quest for spiritual </v>

2705
02:19:34.810 --> 02:19:36.230
<v Speaker 1>enlightenment in and mystical at one </v>
<v Speaker 1>moment,</v>

2706
02:19:36.260 --> 02:19:41.150
<v Speaker 1>right through through this arduous </v>
<v Speaker 1>program of yoga and meditation and in,</v>

2707
02:19:41.200 --> 02:19:43.700
<v Speaker 1>in all of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it'll take you years,</v>

2708
02:19:44.060 --> 02:19:46.910
<v Speaker 1>but who is going to embark upon such a </v>
<v Speaker 1>program?</v>

2709
02:19:46.911 --> 02:19:50.840
<v Speaker 1>Not really knowing that the end of it is</v>
<v Speaker 1>this ecstatic,</v>

2710
02:19:50.841 --> 02:19:53.720
<v Speaker 1>mystical union with the god had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2711
02:19:55.040 --> 02:19:56.630
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they said it basically.</v>

2712
02:19:56.660 --> 02:19:59.720
<v Speaker 1>Nature's provided shortcuts so that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

2713
02:19:59.780 --> 02:20:03.830
<v Speaker 1>we could actually see what the goal of </v>
<v Speaker 1>it was and know that,</v>

2714
02:20:04.010 --> 02:20:09.010
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the end of this process that might </v>

2715
02:20:09.010 --> 02:20:09.010
<v Speaker 1>take you 10 years or five years or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

2716
02:20:09.140 --> 02:20:14.140
<v Speaker 1>depending on your dedication.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is this all this experience of </v>

2717
02:20:14.140 --> 02:20:18.520
<v Speaker 1>your consciousness expanding into these </v>
<v Speaker 1>ecstatic states agents of evolution as </v>

2718
02:20:18.520 --> 02:20:21.050
<v Speaker 1>it were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's the thing that people,</v>

2719
02:20:21.230 --> 02:20:25.290
<v Speaker 1>I think universally feel from </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychedelic experiences,</v>

2720
02:20:25.291 --> 02:20:30.291
<v Speaker 1>is that it allows you to get over a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>of these sort of built in instincts that</v>

2721
02:20:31.941 --> 02:20:36.941
<v Speaker 1>we have from our thousands of years of </v>
<v Speaker 1>evolution and the the time that we were </v>

2722
02:20:37.701 --> 02:20:40.280
<v Speaker 1>essentially living like wild animals.</v>

2723
02:20:40.490 --> 02:20:45.490
<v Speaker 1>those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those genes are still in our system and </v>

2724
02:20:45.490 --> 02:20:49.211
<v Speaker 1>we have all these ideas of paranoia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And fear and ego and jealousy and all </v>

2725
02:20:52.191 --> 02:20:55.220
<v Speaker 1>these different things that allowed us </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be ultra competitive,</v>

2726
02:20:55.221 --> 02:20:57.890
<v Speaker 1>which allowed us to innovate at a faster</v>
<v Speaker 1>rate,</v>

2727
02:20:58.100 --> 02:21:00.740
<v Speaker 1>which allowed us to get to where we are </v>
<v Speaker 1>in 2015.</v>

2728
02:21:00.741 --> 02:21:05.330
<v Speaker 1>But those things are kind of hampering </v>
<v Speaker 1>us because we were outgrowing the monkey</v>

2729
02:21:05.331 --> 02:21:06.590
<v Speaker 1>body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2730
02:21:06.591 --> 02:21:08.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we're going to travel to um,</v>

2731
02:21:09.490 --> 02:21:10.950
<v Speaker 1>we wanted to travel to europe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2732
02:21:11.450 --> 02:21:16.450
<v Speaker 1>You can't drive there in a car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can go drive from here to the east </v>

2733
02:21:16.450 --> 02:21:16.450
<v Speaker 1>coast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But once you get to the coastline,</v>

2734
02:21:16.450 --> 02:21:18.530
<v Speaker 1>you have to get out of the car and get </v>
<v Speaker 1>into a different vehicle,</v>

2735
02:21:18.980 --> 02:21:23.980
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if you keep driving in the same </v>

2736
02:21:23.980 --> 02:21:25.781
<v Speaker 1>car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to go into the ocean and </v>

2737
02:21:25.781 --> 02:21:25.781
<v Speaker 1>you're going to drown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2738
02:21:25.781 --> 02:21:26.330
<v Speaker 1>We're kind of liked that in the sense </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

2739
02:21:26.360 --> 02:21:27.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see,</v>

2740
02:21:27.591 --> 02:21:30.470
<v Speaker 1>I think that war was perhaps inevitable.</v>

2741
02:21:30.600 --> 02:21:33.320
<v Speaker 1>You know this because it's embedded in </v>
<v Speaker 1>our consciousness.</v>

2742
02:21:33.321 --> 02:21:35.990
<v Speaker 1>You see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just showed you hear evidence that the</v>

2743
02:21:35.991 --> 02:21:39.440
<v Speaker 1>human population crashed coming out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the younger dryas.</v>

2744
02:21:39.890 --> 02:21:42.170
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's ironic is that after the,</v>

2745
02:21:42.350 --> 02:21:45.710
<v Speaker 1>after the ice age was over for about </v>
<v Speaker 1>three or 4,000</v>

2746
02:21:45.711 --> 02:21:48.350
<v Speaker 1>years from 6,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>to about 9,000,</v>

2747
02:21:48.470 --> 02:21:50.090
<v Speaker 1>9,500</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago,</v>

2748
02:21:50.840 --> 02:21:55.840
<v Speaker 1>what we had was a period known as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>climatic optimum by the scientists who </v>

2749
02:21:55.840 --> 02:22:00.621
<v Speaker 1>have looked at it in which some of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>estimates are that Global average </v>

2750
02:22:00.621 --> 02:22:02.030
<v Speaker 1>climate might've been two to four </v>
<v Speaker 1>degrees warmer than now.</v>

2751
02:22:02.570 --> 02:22:07.570
<v Speaker 1>What that meant was that you had a much </v>
<v Speaker 1>longer growing season and anybody who </v>

2752
02:22:07.701 --> 02:22:12.701
<v Speaker 1>doubts is please do your own research or</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can post all kinds of stuff online </v>

2753
02:22:12.701 --> 02:22:14.620
<v Speaker 1>that anybody who's not immediately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2754
02:22:17.720 --> 02:22:20.150
<v Speaker 1>can't handle this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This can kind of information.</v>

2755
02:22:20.151 --> 02:22:25.151
<v Speaker 1>Anybody who's open minded can actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>go and do their homework and see that </v>

2756
02:22:25.151 --> 02:22:26.010
<v Speaker 1>the climate climatic is well</v>

2757
02:22:26.010 --> 02:22:31.010
<v Speaker 3>documented and for about three to 4,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years basically we were living in an </v>

2758
02:22:32.221 --> 02:22:36.270
<v Speaker 3>almost quasi parodies iol state.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Almost a garden of eden.</v>

2759
02:22:36.271 --> 02:22:41.190
<v Speaker 3>Like it was almost like after their </v>
<v Speaker 3>traumatic birth of this modern age.</v>

2760
02:22:41.191 --> 02:22:46.191
<v Speaker 3>The holocene that we're in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like nature just sort of was this </v>

2761
02:22:46.191 --> 02:22:50.750
<v Speaker 3>nurturing environment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was during this period that humans </v>

2762
02:22:51.001 --> 02:22:56.001
<v Speaker 3>were worshiping.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The earth in the form of this corpulent </v>

2763
02:22:56.001 --> 02:22:56.400
<v Speaker 3>pregnant goddess,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2764
02:22:56.640 --> 02:22:59.760
<v Speaker 3>It's been called the goddess </v>
<v Speaker 3>civilization by maria gimbutas,</v>

2765
02:22:59.820 --> 02:23:02.130
<v Speaker 3>who was the archaeologist who did all of</v>
<v Speaker 3>this work.</v>

2766
02:23:02.490 --> 02:23:04.620
<v Speaker 3>And what was interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you look into her work,</v>

2767
02:23:04.621 --> 02:23:09.621
<v Speaker 3>is that during this period of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the early neolithic in the </v>

2768
02:23:09.621 --> 02:23:13.440
<v Speaker 3>archaeological terminology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is no evidence of any warfare.</v>

2769
02:23:14.010 --> 02:23:16.460
<v Speaker 3>There's no evidence that people are </v>
<v Speaker 3>looking at,</v>

2770
02:23:16.470 --> 02:23:17.070
<v Speaker 3>at the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2771
02:23:17.080 --> 02:23:17.780
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2772
02:23:17.840 --> 02:23:21.150
<v Speaker 3>the carvings that people did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the artwork that people did,</v>

2773
02:23:21.390 --> 02:23:24.810
<v Speaker 3>looking at the communities,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there were not stockades like there were</v>

2774
02:23:24.811 --> 02:23:25.230
<v Speaker 3>later.</v>

2775
02:23:25.470 --> 02:23:30.470
<v Speaker 3>There was no evidence in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the archaeological record of </v>

2776
02:23:30.650 --> 02:23:35.650
<v Speaker 3>weaponization.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it makes sense because in the </v>

2777
02:23:35.650 --> 02:23:38.790
<v Speaker 3>aftermath of this extreme event that </v>
<v Speaker 3>ended the ice age,</v>

2778
02:23:38.791 --> 02:23:43.791
<v Speaker 3>which you had was huge areas of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>planet that were depopulated nature </v>

2779
02:23:44.521 --> 02:23:49.521
<v Speaker 3>quickly begins to reclaim.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what you now have is you have this </v>

2780
02:23:50.100 --> 02:23:51.990
<v Speaker 3>sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this benign warmth.</v>

2781
02:23:52.380 --> 02:23:56.520
<v Speaker 3>We're growing seasons are months longer </v>
<v Speaker 3>than now,</v>

2782
02:23:56.790 --> 02:23:59.130
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>farming 14,</v>

2783
02:23:59.131 --> 02:24:02.700
<v Speaker 3>1500 feet higher in the mountains than </v>
<v Speaker 3>is now possible.</v>

2784
02:24:03.030 --> 02:24:04.440
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2785
02:24:04.490 --> 02:24:05.780
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2786
02:24:05.790 --> 02:24:10.790
<v Speaker 3>long,</v>
<v Speaker 3>longer growing seasons and rapid </v>

2787
02:24:10.790 --> 02:24:11.760
<v Speaker 3>expansion of population during this era.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This would have been the era,</v>

2788
02:24:11.940 --> 02:24:16.940
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>think about what would the biblical </v>

2789
02:24:16.940 --> 02:24:16.940
<v Speaker 3>injunction that you always gave to adam </v>
<v Speaker 3>and eve,</v>

2790
02:24:16.940 --> 02:24:19.110
<v Speaker 3>what did he say?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Be fruitful and multiply,</v>

2791
02:24:20.070 --> 02:24:23.100
<v Speaker 3>replenish the earth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and subdue it.</v>

2792
02:24:23.520 --> 02:24:24.990
<v Speaker 3>Be fruitful and multiply.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well.</v>

2793
02:24:25.010 --> 02:24:28.170
<v Speaker 3>If you've got a species hovering on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>brink of extinction,</v>

2794
02:24:28.171 --> 02:24:30.660
<v Speaker 3>what's the most important thing that </v>
<v Speaker 3>that species can do?</v>

2795
02:24:31.290 --> 02:24:33.720
<v Speaker 3>Lots of sex,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lots of reproduction,</v>

2796
02:24:33.840 --> 02:24:38.280
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>In the context of those times,</v>

2797
02:24:38.610 --> 02:24:42.720
<v Speaker 3>it would've been very important for </v>
<v Speaker 3>people to have lots of sex too quickly,</v>

2798
02:24:42.721 --> 02:24:47.640
<v Speaker 3>reestablish the viability of the human </v>
<v Speaker 3>species because we were literally at now</v>

2799
02:24:47.641 --> 02:24:50.100
<v Speaker 3>appears hovering on the brink of </v>
<v Speaker 3>extinction.</v>

2800
02:24:50.101 --> 02:24:53.520
<v Speaker 3>As were so many of the other large </v>
<v Speaker 3>mammals of the planet,</v>

2801
02:24:53.820 --> 02:24:57.650
<v Speaker 3>right and nature gave us this interval,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this window,</v>

2802
02:24:57.670 --> 02:25:01.560
<v Speaker 3>three or 4,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years of extremely mild climate,</v>

2803
02:25:01.710 --> 02:25:03.690
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>During this time,</v>

2804
02:25:04.500 --> 02:25:08.640
<v Speaker 3>human population rapidly expanded and </v>
<v Speaker 3>moved into these vacated habitats.</v>

2805
02:25:09.630 --> 02:25:11.220
<v Speaker 3>Around 6,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago,</v>

2806
02:25:11.820 --> 02:25:16.820
<v Speaker 3>the climate shifted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What started was has been called by the </v>

2807
02:25:16.820 --> 02:25:20.960
<v Speaker 3>paleoclimatologists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the neo glaciation because the planet </v>

2808
02:25:20.971 --> 02:25:24.010
<v Speaker 3>cooled a couple of degrees.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What happened?</v>

2809
02:25:25.060 --> 02:25:29.230
<v Speaker 3>Agricultural habitats contracted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The growing the,</v>

2810
02:25:29.231 --> 02:25:29.740
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2811
02:25:29.800 --> 02:25:32.680
<v Speaker 3>the elevation of viable agriculture came</v>
<v Speaker 3>down.</v>

2812
02:25:33.190 --> 02:25:38.190
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now if you've got settled human </v>

2813
02:25:38.190 --> 02:25:39.370
<v Speaker 3>communities that have become well </v>
<v Speaker 3>established and living,</v>

2814
02:25:39.540 --> 02:25:44.540
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the context of that environment and </v>

2815
02:25:44.540 --> 02:25:45.550
<v Speaker 3>now suddenly that environment changes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2816
02:25:46.120 --> 02:25:51.120
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Coincident with those environmental </v>

2817
02:25:51.120 --> 02:25:53.581
<v Speaker 3>changes around 6,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago is when we see the first </v>

2818
02:25:53.581 --> 02:25:56.050
<v Speaker 3>appearance of human conflict because now</v>
<v Speaker 3>with this changing climate,</v>

2819
02:25:56.051 --> 02:26:01.051
<v Speaker 3>you've got this disruption is major </v>
<v Speaker 3>disruption in human communities that </v>

2820
02:26:01.051 --> 02:26:02.710
<v Speaker 3>have been well established and </v>
<v Speaker 3>proliferating for three or 4,000</v>

2821
02:26:02.711 --> 02:26:04.570
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Think about,</v>

2822
02:26:04.571 --> 02:26:09.571
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're living in a community in your </v>

2823
02:26:09.571 --> 02:26:09.571
<v Speaker 3>farming at 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>feet above sea level,</v>

2824
02:26:09.940 --> 02:26:14.940
<v Speaker 3>a smaller example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a micro example would be the freezing </v>

2825
02:26:14.940 --> 02:26:18.361
<v Speaker 3>out of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the greenland colonists with the </v>

2826
02:26:18.361 --> 02:26:18.670
<v Speaker 3>onset of the little ice age,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2827
02:26:18.970 --> 02:26:23.860
<v Speaker 3>For 500 years they were able to farm on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the west coast of greenland and then the</v>

2828
02:26:23.920 --> 02:26:28.920
<v Speaker 3>little ice age came on and they were </v>
<v Speaker 3>frozen out and they tried to hang on as </v>

2829
02:26:28.920 --> 02:26:31.780
<v Speaker 3>long as they could,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it kept getting harder and harder to</v>

2830
02:26:31.781 --> 02:26:36.781
<v Speaker 3>grow crops.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the climate declined further </v>

2831
02:26:36.781 --> 02:26:37.570
<v Speaker 3>and the cis began to move south.</v>

2832
02:26:37.900 --> 02:26:41.440
<v Speaker 3>And the one who waited too long lost </v>
<v Speaker 3>their opportunity.</v>

2833
02:26:41.441 --> 02:26:46.441
<v Speaker 3>Because once the cia said moved south at</v>
<v Speaker 3>cutoff the lanes so that they could </v>

2834
02:26:46.441 --> 02:26:49.480
<v Speaker 3>actually evacuate greenland colonies </v>
<v Speaker 3>completely went extinct.</v>

2835
02:26:49.810 --> 02:26:53.080
<v Speaker 3>Iceland itself was almost completely </v>
<v Speaker 3>depopulated during this.</v>

2836
02:26:53.830 --> 02:26:56.710
<v Speaker 3>If we take that scenario,</v>
<v Speaker 3>expand it,</v>

2837
02:26:56.711 --> 02:26:58.240
<v Speaker 3>and go back 6,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago,</v>

2838
02:26:58.360 --> 02:27:01.720
<v Speaker 3>we essentially see a very similar </v>
<v Speaker 3>parallel phenomena going on,</v>

2839
02:27:02.230 --> 02:27:06.880
<v Speaker 3>and so when you figure for during it a </v>
<v Speaker 3>civilization age of the goddess,</v>

2840
02:27:06.881 --> 02:27:11.881
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this time that people were worshiping </v>

2841
02:27:11.881 --> 02:27:11.881
<v Speaker 3>the earth in the form of this corpulent </v>
<v Speaker 3>pregnant goddess,</v>

2842
02:27:11.890 --> 02:27:13.780
<v Speaker 3>this benign,</v>
<v Speaker 3>motherly,</v>

2843
02:27:13.781 --> 02:27:17.140
<v Speaker 3>nurturing goddess,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was no reason for conflict because</v>

2844
02:27:17.440 --> 02:27:20.140
<v Speaker 3>human populations were small,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were isolated.</v>

2845
02:27:20.230 --> 02:27:25.060
<v Speaker 3>Resource base was enormous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then with the climate change,</v>

2846
02:27:25.090 --> 02:27:30.090
<v Speaker 3>what happened suddenly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now human communities and populations </v>

2847
02:27:30.090 --> 02:27:32.200
<v Speaker 3>are disrupted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Migrations began happening.</v>

2848
02:27:32.260 --> 02:27:37.260
<v Speaker 3>One group conflicts with another group,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and now we see the implements and the </v>

2849
02:27:37.451 --> 02:27:38.620
<v Speaker 3>evidence of warfare.</v>

2850
02:27:39.460 --> 02:27:42.040
<v Speaker 3>If we go back to 10,000,</v>
<v Speaker 3>12,000</v>

2851
02:27:42.041 --> 02:27:45.910
<v Speaker 3>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>clearly whatever happened then must have</v>

2852
02:27:45.911 --> 02:27:48.370
<v Speaker 3>been profoundly traumatic to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>survivors.</v>

2853
02:27:48.880 --> 02:27:53.880
<v Speaker 3>Think about this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you were the survivor of an event </v>

2854
02:27:53.880 --> 02:27:57.480
<v Speaker 3>that basically erased modern </v>
<v Speaker 3>civilization and you were living in a </v>

2855
02:27:57.480 --> 02:28:01.201
<v Speaker 3>small,</v>
<v Speaker 3>isolated banda survivors with no way to </v>

2856
02:28:01.201 --> 02:28:04.681
<v Speaker 3>communicate with the rest of the world </v>
<v Speaker 3>and no knowledge of whether there was </v>

2857
02:28:04.681 --> 02:28:05.740
<v Speaker 3>even other survivors anywhere on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>earth,</v>

2858
02:28:06.700 --> 02:28:08.420
<v Speaker 3>it could profoundly affect your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>

2859
02:28:08.430 --> 02:28:09.640
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your consciousness,</v>

2860
02:28:10.090 --> 02:28:15.090
<v Speaker 3>and that could be so profound that it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>the imprint of those events could be so </v>

2861
02:28:15.341 --> 02:28:20.341
<v Speaker 3>profound that it could be passed on for </v>
<v Speaker 3>generations and and be lodged in our </v>

2862
02:28:21.741 --> 02:28:26.741
<v Speaker 3>subconscious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This idea of human conflict necessary </v>

2863
02:28:26.741 --> 02:28:30.130
<v Speaker 3>for human survival into traumas that had</v>
<v Speaker 3>been visited upon our species by nature </v>

2864
02:28:30.130 --> 02:28:34.601
<v Speaker 3>itself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think that once we come to terms </v>

2865
02:28:34.881 --> 02:28:39.881
<v Speaker 3>with the possibly origins of only until </v>
<v Speaker 3>we come to terms with the origin of </v>

2866
02:28:39.881 --> 02:28:43.190
<v Speaker 3>human conflict,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are we going to be able to purge it once</v>

2867
02:28:43.191 --> 02:28:48.191
<v Speaker 3>and for all and and realize that that </v>
<v Speaker 3>the modern analog for that scenario was </v>

2868
02:28:51.141 --> 02:28:53.300
<v Speaker 3>that coming out of that catastrophe.</v>

2869
02:28:53.720 --> 02:28:56.180
<v Speaker 3>Abundant resources,</v>
<v Speaker 3>abundance,</v>

2870
02:28:56.181 --> 02:28:57.950
<v Speaker 3>habitat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>abundant space,</v>

2871
02:28:58.670 --> 02:29:03.670
<v Speaker 3>no conflict for territory or resources </v>
<v Speaker 3>because the human population was </v>

2872
02:29:03.670 --> 02:29:05.840
<v Speaker 3>limited.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What I suggest is that if people want to</v>

2873
02:29:05.841 --> 02:29:08.990
<v Speaker 3>understand the future of the human </v>
<v Speaker 3>species,</v>

2874
02:29:09.140 --> 02:29:13.880
<v Speaker 3>go out on a crystal clear night and look</v>
<v Speaker 3>at sky.</v>

2875
02:29:14.680 --> 02:29:18.110
<v Speaker 3>There is the future.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's our potential future because the</v>

2876
02:29:18.111 --> 02:29:23.111
<v Speaker 3>scenario is that had been around since </v>
<v Speaker 3>the 1970 [inaudible] show that </v>

2877
02:29:23.111 --> 02:29:24.530
<v Speaker 3>everything that we're extracting now </v>
<v Speaker 3>from the earth,</v>

2878
02:29:25.010 --> 02:29:27.350
<v Speaker 3>the minerals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the precious metals,</v>

2879
02:29:27.351 --> 02:29:31.400
<v Speaker 3>the hydrocarbons,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's all out there in infinite abundance</v>

2880
02:29:31.460 --> 02:29:36.460
<v Speaker 3>and it's basically just outside of our </v>
<v Speaker 3>doorstep and we are as close now to </v>

2881
02:29:37.221 --> 02:29:42.221
<v Speaker 3>being able to harvest the resources of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the cosmic environment as we were from </v>

2882
02:29:42.221 --> 02:29:47.140
<v Speaker 3>setting foot on the moon in 1960.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you think we've been visited before </v>

2883
02:29:47.140 --> 02:29:51.560
<v Speaker 3>by something from other planets?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think perhaps long,</v>

2884
02:29:51.561 --> 02:29:56.561
<v Speaker 3>long ago maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's another scenario there that </v>

2885
02:29:56.561 --> 02:30:00.100
<v Speaker 3>has been overlooked In all of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>discussions about ufo is an aliens and </v>

2886
02:30:00.100 --> 02:30:02.030
<v Speaker 3>at some point we'll talk about that some</v>
<v Speaker 3>point.</v>

2887
02:30:02.630 --> 02:30:03.920
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You tease.</v>

2888
02:30:07.850 --> 02:30:09.800
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2889
02:30:09.801 --> 02:30:13.310
<v Speaker 3>it's the kind of thing where you kind of</v>
<v Speaker 3>need to lay out the case in,</v>

2890
02:30:13.311 --> 02:30:18.311
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in what I like to do is basically </v>

2891
02:30:18.311 --> 02:30:21.371
<v Speaker 3>present the evidence and see if whoever </v>
<v Speaker 3>then draws the same conclusions from </v>

2892
02:30:21.741 --> 02:30:23.750
<v Speaker 3>that evidence that I have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

2893
02:30:24.190 --> 02:30:24.740
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me,</v>

2894
02:30:24.770 --> 02:30:28.970
<v Speaker 3>let me put it to you this way in what we</v>
<v Speaker 3>were talking about at the very beginning</v>

2895
02:30:29.000 --> 02:30:32.150
<v Speaker 3>of this interview and in talking about </v>
<v Speaker 3>7,000</v>

2896
02:30:32.151 --> 02:30:37.151
<v Speaker 3>generations of people and and the fact </v>
<v Speaker 3>that in four or five generations we went</v>

2897
02:30:37.161 --> 02:30:42.161
<v Speaker 3>from horseback to rocket ships.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How many times in the last 7,000</v>

2898
02:30:42.651 --> 02:30:45.020
<v Speaker 3>years do you suppose that we could have </v>
<v Speaker 3>done that?</v>

2899
02:30:46.190 --> 02:30:51.190
<v Speaker 3>To me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not implausible that we could have </v>

2900
02:30:51.190 --> 02:30:52.871
<v Speaker 3>achieved flight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even interest in interplanetary flight </v>

2901
02:30:52.871 --> 02:30:54.930
<v Speaker 3>more than once.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just as we have.</v>

2902
02:30:54.950 --> 02:30:55.700
<v Speaker 3>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Think about it,</v>

2903
02:30:56.150 --> 02:31:01.150
<v Speaker 3>we have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have achieved interplanetary flight </v>

2904
02:31:01.150 --> 02:31:01.970
<v Speaker 3>even though only manned expeditions to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to near space,</v>

2905
02:31:01.971 --> 02:31:05.360
<v Speaker 3>but we're sending our satellites out </v>
<v Speaker 3>beyond the solar system.</v>

2906
02:31:05.720 --> 02:31:07.700
<v Speaker 3>All of this has come about in my </v>
<v Speaker 3>lifetime,</v>

2907
02:31:07.910 --> 02:31:08.690
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Totally.</v>

2908
02:31:08.691 --> 02:31:10.840
<v Speaker 3>In my life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tall since the 1958.</v>

2909
02:31:10.880 --> 02:31:13.520
<v Speaker 3>My grandfather,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when he was a kid,</v>

2910
02:31:13.550 --> 02:31:17.870
<v Speaker 3>you know it was horses and a big point </v>
<v Speaker 3>is that if we died off now,</v>

2911
02:31:17.871 --> 02:31:19.530
<v Speaker 3>if there's some sort of mass extinction </v>
<v Speaker 3>event,</v>

2912
02:31:19.531 --> 02:31:20.220
<v Speaker 3>there'd be very</v>

2913
02:31:20.220 --> 02:31:22.890
<v Speaker 4>little evidence of this space travel,</v>
<v Speaker 4>thousands of.</v>

2914
02:31:22.930 --> 02:31:24.870
<v Speaker 4>There'll be no evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All the aluminum,</v>

2915
02:31:24.871 --> 02:31:27.780
<v Speaker 4>all the stuff that the rockets out of it</v>
<v Speaker 4>would all be gone,</v>

2916
02:31:27.810 --> 02:31:29.310
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The earth would aBsorb it.</v>

2917
02:31:29.610 --> 02:31:32.760
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's just consider as a wild,</v>

2918
02:31:32.790 --> 02:31:37.790
<v Speaker 4>outrageous working hypothesis that </v>
<v Speaker 4>humans have been able to offload from </v>

2919
02:31:38.551 --> 02:31:42.870
<v Speaker 4>the planet prior to that prior to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>modern space age.</v>

2920
02:31:43.470 --> 02:31:48.470
<v Speaker 4>So at one point in time we went to mars,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's probably somewhere a little </v>

2921
02:31:48.470 --> 02:31:50.250
<v Speaker 4>closer than that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It would've made sense like the moon,</v>

2922
02:31:50.400 --> 02:31:53.490
<v Speaker 4>like the moon,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like we've been able to establish a base</v>

2923
02:31:53.491 --> 02:31:54.720
<v Speaker 4>on the moon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2924
02:31:55.560 --> 02:31:57.240
<v Speaker 4>Now this isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I said,</v>

2925
02:31:57.950 --> 02:32:02.010
<v Speaker 4>great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is an outrageous heretic.</v>

2926
02:32:02.050 --> 02:32:04.140
<v Speaker 4>I'm what else?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You've done drugs,</v>

2927
02:32:05.190 --> 02:32:07.620
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is over.</v>

2928
02:32:08.670 --> 02:32:12.360
<v Speaker 4>It's time to lock me away.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Gag me,</v>

2929
02:32:12.361 --> 02:32:13.340
<v Speaker 4>muslim me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In life,</v>

2930
02:32:13.350 --> 02:32:16.140
<v Speaker 4>we consider the fact that our </v>
<v Speaker 4>civilization,</v>

2931
02:32:16.200 --> 02:32:18.180
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if all your theories are true,</v>

2932
02:32:18.181 --> 02:32:22.590
<v Speaker 4>which they most certainly appear to be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>our civilization has been rebooted as of</v>

2933
02:32:22.591 --> 02:32:23.880
<v Speaker 4>12,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>years ago.</v>

2934
02:32:24.150 --> 02:32:27.270
<v Speaker 4>Modern civilization emerges somewhere </v>
<v Speaker 4>around 70,000</v>

2935
02:32:27.271 --> 02:32:31.650
<v Speaker 4>years ago and four point 6 billion years</v>
<v Speaker 4>of life on earth,</v>

2936
02:32:31.651 --> 02:32:33.420
<v Speaker 4>or excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the life of the earth,</v>

2937
02:32:33.421 --> 02:32:34.290
<v Speaker 4>the earth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>existing,</v>

2938
02:32:34.291 --> 02:32:36.540
<v Speaker 4>and then life on earth being,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2939
02:32:36.720 --> 02:32:40.890
<v Speaker 4>in our form what few hundred thousand </v>
<v Speaker 4>years,</v>

2940
02:32:41.040 --> 02:32:42.600
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>In 100,000</v>

2941
02:32:42.601 --> 02:32:44.000
<v Speaker 4>years is all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2942
02:32:44.480 --> 02:32:45.720
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's 10,</v>

2943
02:32:46.230 --> 02:32:51.230
<v Speaker 4>10 events since the big impact 10 times.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But remember the greenland ice core </v>

2944
02:32:52.231 --> 02:32:53.370
<v Speaker 4>graft and they showed you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2945
02:32:53.520 --> 02:32:58.520
<v Speaker 4>what you're seeing there is a dozen or </v>
<v Speaker 4>more enormous events in the last </v>

2946
02:32:59.070 --> 02:33:00.720
<v Speaker 4>quarter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>million years into time.</v>

2947
02:33:01.440 --> 02:33:03.810
<v Speaker 4>Probably the human getting the oldest </v>
<v Speaker 4>human skeleton,</v>

2948
02:33:03.840 --> 02:33:07.020
<v Speaker 4>modern modern humans.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Skeleton is now dated to about 180,000</v>

2949
02:33:07.021 --> 02:33:09.330
<v Speaker 4>years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How much earlier than that?</v>

2950
02:33:09.360 --> 02:33:10.470
<v Speaker 4>Where we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

2951
02:33:10.530 --> 02:33:14.720
<v Speaker 4>but conservatively we can say 180,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>years at greenland ice core grafted,</v>

2952
02:33:14.760 --> 02:33:17.460
<v Speaker 4>I showed you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it goes back 250,000.</v>

2953
02:33:17.520 --> 02:33:22.520
<v Speaker 4>So the rig veda stories of the amanas </v>
<v Speaker 4>and the flying crafts and all that could</v>

2954
02:33:22.561 --> 02:33:26.310
<v Speaker 4>actually have been based on real live </v>
<v Speaker 4>objects,</v>

2955
02:33:26.670 --> 02:33:30.300
<v Speaker 4>real live spaceships that someone read </v>
<v Speaker 4>the sumerian stories.</v>

2956
02:33:30.300 --> 02:33:32.520
<v Speaker 4>What did they say in the wake of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>flood?</v>

2957
02:33:32.521 --> 02:33:35.040
<v Speaker 4>It was so disastrous that what did the </v>
<v Speaker 4>gods do?</v>

2958
02:33:35.370 --> 02:33:39.210
<v Speaker 4>They fled the earth and went to space.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It says right there in the myth itself,</v>

2959
02:33:40.140 --> 02:33:41.190
<v Speaker 4>since they left,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they went,</v>

2960
02:33:41.220 --> 02:33:46.220
<v Speaker 4>when they left the earth and went to the</v>
<v Speaker 4>heavens because what was going on on </v>

2961
02:33:46.220 --> 02:33:47.570
<v Speaker 4>your earth was so traumatic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It even freaked them out.</v>

2962
02:33:48.480 --> 02:33:50.040
<v Speaker 4>Read the story,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the gods,</v>

2963
02:33:50.100 --> 02:33:53.260
<v Speaker 4>the gods,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hanky and ian and nunan,</v>

2964
02:33:53.380 --> 02:33:54.960
<v Speaker 4>nerc,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don and the rest of.</v>

2965
02:33:55.020 --> 02:34:00.020
<v Speaker 4>What did you think of zechariah </v>
<v Speaker 4>situation and is fantastical </v>

2966
02:34:00.020 --> 02:34:05.000
<v Speaker 4>translations of the sumerian texts </v>
<v Speaker 4>dubious about some of his most are </v>

2967
02:34:05.000 --> 02:34:09.981
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>most people who are experts in the </v>

2968
02:34:09.981 --> 02:34:09.981
<v Speaker 4>sumerian cuneiform.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2969
02:34:09.981 --> 02:34:11.670
<v Speaker 4>I think that he was kind of cuckoo.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cuckoo,</v>

2970
02:34:11.850 --> 02:34:12.930
<v Speaker 4>cuckoo.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2971
02:34:12.931 --> 02:34:17.931
<v Speaker 4>but what's fascinating is there's so </v>
<v Speaker 4>much that they absolutely understood </v>

2972
02:34:18.071 --> 02:34:21.640
<v Speaker 4>that's really confusing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like they understood they had an ad,</v>

2973
02:34:21.760 --> 02:34:23.980
<v Speaker 4>an accurate depiction of our solar </v>
<v Speaker 4>system,</v>

2974
02:34:23.981 --> 02:34:28.981
<v Speaker 4>which included pluto,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which included all the planets and all </v>

2975
02:34:28.981 --> 02:34:30.190
<v Speaker 4>the orbit in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>

2976
02:34:30.250 --> 02:34:32.230
<v Speaker 4>in the correct,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2977
02:34:32.350 --> 02:34:37.350
<v Speaker 4>relatively correct sizes on these clay </v>
<v Speaker 4>tablets that they made nine thousand </v>

2978
02:34:39.670 --> 02:34:41.230
<v Speaker 4>seven thousand dollars,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who knows how many thousand years ago,</v>

2979
02:34:41.750 --> 02:34:42.220
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

2980
02:34:42.580 --> 02:34:43.720
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess I'm,</v>

2981
02:34:44.060 --> 02:34:49.060
<v Speaker 4>I read some kitcheN and stuff years and </v>
<v Speaker 4>years ago and at the time took it with a</v>

2982
02:34:49.211 --> 02:34:51.730
<v Speaker 4>grain of salt and subsequent to that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2983
02:34:51.731 --> 02:34:53.740
<v Speaker 4>after I've seen some of the critiques of</v>
<v Speaker 4>him,</v>

2984
02:34:54.310 --> 02:34:57.240
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm kind of in that category myself.</v>

2985
02:34:57.241 --> 02:34:58.530
<v Speaker 4>I'm thinking because he's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2986
02:34:58.680 --> 02:35:00.120
<v Speaker 4>his,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some of his translations are,</v>

2987
02:35:00.290 --> 02:35:02.470
<v Speaker 4>are dubious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He made some leaps.</v>

2988
02:35:02.800 --> 02:35:07.800
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But what they did discover what they </v>

2989
02:35:07.800 --> 02:35:10.531
<v Speaker 4>have just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's so fascinating to me when you look </v>

2990
02:35:10.531 --> 02:35:13.501
<v Speaker 4>at like the caduceus,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which very clearly resembles the double </v>

2991
02:35:13.501 --> 02:35:17.551
<v Speaker 4>helix of dna and how it's closely </v>
<v Speaker 4>associated with some of these images of </v>

2992
02:35:17.551 --> 02:35:21.700
<v Speaker 4>larger beings holding little smaller </v>
<v Speaker 4>people with tails.</v>

2993
02:35:22.120 --> 02:35:25.750
<v Speaker 4>Like what the fuck is that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like this idea of genetic engineering,</v>

2994
02:35:25.780 --> 02:35:30.780
<v Speaker 4>of taking lower primates and introducing</v>
<v Speaker 4>human or alien dna into these lower </v>

2995
02:35:32.411 --> 02:35:36.880
<v Speaker 4>primates to create modern humans.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what to think about that.</v>

2996
02:35:36.910 --> 02:35:41.910
<v Speaker 4>It sounds ridiculous,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if we found a planet like let's say </v>

2997
02:35:42.041 --> 02:35:45.570
<v Speaker 4>we exist in this state right now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>

2998
02:35:45.580 --> 02:35:46.750
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2999
02:35:46.870 --> 02:35:51.870
<v Speaker 4>we evolve without getting hit in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>head by a big rock from space for </v>

3000
02:35:51.870 --> 02:35:53.890
<v Speaker 4>another thousand years or another 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>years.</v>

3001
02:35:53.891 --> 02:35:57.580
<v Speaker 4>Let's get really fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just imagine how far we could come if we</v>

3002
02:35:57.581 --> 02:35:59.440
<v Speaker 4>don't blow ourselves up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We don't.</v>

3003
02:35:59.500 --> 02:36:03.040
<v Speaker 4>Yellowstone doesn't explode.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We live another 10,000</v>

3004
02:36:03.041 --> 02:36:08.041
<v Speaker 4>years and we jet off into the cosmos and</v>
<v Speaker 4>find some planet with a bunch of dumb </v>

3005
02:36:08.041 --> 02:36:12.781
<v Speaker 4>monkeys on it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't think we would splice our dna </v>

3006
02:36:12.781 --> 02:36:12.781
<v Speaker 4>into those dumb monkeys just to say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>listen,</v>

3007
02:36:12.781 --> 02:36:15.900
<v Speaker 4>I think you guys could do better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could be like us.</v>

3008
02:36:15.920 --> 02:36:18.160
<v Speaker 4>We're going to give you a little bump.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We know what's coming.</v>

3009
02:36:18.190 --> 02:36:23.190
<v Speaker 4>If you guys keep going along this way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could get to where we are in the </v>

3010
02:36:23.190 --> 02:36:25.510
<v Speaker 4>million plus years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Weakened a little injection maybe.</v>

3011
02:36:25.880 --> 02:36:27.610
<v Speaker 4>How about a scenario like this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

3012
02:36:28.270 --> 02:36:33.270
<v Speaker 4>well from our superior perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we know that you guys down here are </v>

3013
02:36:33.270 --> 02:36:36.801
<v Speaker 4>living on a vulnerable planet that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to be habits to ask kicked every </v>

3014
02:36:36.801 --> 02:36:40.591
<v Speaker 4>so often,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so we're going to do something to </v>

3015
02:36:40.591 --> 02:36:42.820
<v Speaker 4>accelerate your evolution a bit so that </v>
<v Speaker 4>perhaps you can become a little bit more</v>

3016
02:36:42.821 --> 02:36:47.821
<v Speaker 4>intelligent and figure this out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're going to leave some clues behind </v>

3017
02:36:47.821 --> 02:36:51.361
<v Speaker 4>for you and then we're going to leave it</v>
<v Speaker 4>in your hands to basically redeem to </v>

3018
02:36:52.600 --> 02:36:57.600
<v Speaker 4>redeem the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's amazing how often people just like </v>

3019
02:36:57.600 --> 02:36:58.450
<v Speaker 4>completely dismissed any ideas like </v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

3020
02:36:58.451 --> 02:37:03.451
<v Speaker 4>but yet we clearly are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're very advanced in compared to life </v>

3021
02:37:04.421 --> 02:37:09.421
<v Speaker 4>on earth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but clearly we're advancing into the </v>

3022
02:37:09.421 --> 02:37:12.010
<v Speaker 4>solar system at the very least with </v>
<v Speaker 4>robots.</v>

3023
02:37:12.370 --> 02:37:12.840
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>

3024
02:37:12.841 --> 02:37:15.980
<v Speaker 4>we haven't really been doing man space </v>
<v Speaker 4>trips</v>

3025
02:37:15.980 --> 02:37:20.980
<v Speaker 1>anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're sending a lot of fucking </v>

3026
02:37:20.980 --> 02:37:20.980
<v Speaker 1>robots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3027
02:37:20.980 --> 02:37:24.520
<v Speaker 1>we're sending satellites,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're sending all these things to go </v>

3028
02:37:24.520 --> 02:37:28.811
<v Speaker 1>around other planets and take images.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Were sending robots that land on mars to</v>

3029
02:37:29.001 --> 02:37:34.001
<v Speaker 1>rove around and take photos and soil </v>
<v Speaker 1>samples and send information back </v>

3030
02:37:34.641 --> 02:37:36.200
<v Speaker 1>through the sky to earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3031
02:37:36.590 --> 02:37:39.590
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is fantastic stuff.</v>

3032
02:37:39.620 --> 02:37:42.440
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine if you tried to describe to this</v>

3033
02:37:42.500 --> 02:37:45.500
<v Speaker 1>this to somebody 100 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd go get outta here.</v>

3034
02:37:45.860 --> 02:37:50.860
<v Speaker 1>This is outrageous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even want to hear such </v>

3035
02:37:50.860 --> 02:37:51.260
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like you just said,</v>

3036
02:37:51.590 --> 02:37:54.680
<v Speaker 1>considering the pace of change over the </v>
<v Speaker 1>last century,</v>

3037
02:37:55.090 --> 02:37:56.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>given us a century ago,</v>

3038
02:37:56.271 --> 02:37:59.920
<v Speaker 1>there was no airline industry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but of course the thing was if you know,</v>

3039
02:37:59.921 --> 02:38:04.921
<v Speaker 1>if you had the government bureaucracies </v>
<v Speaker 1>like you like you have now back then </v>

3040
02:38:05.000 --> 02:38:10.000
<v Speaker 1>orville and wilbur would have never been</v>
<v Speaker 1>able to test their flights because some </v>

3041
02:38:10.000 --> 02:38:13.151
<v Speaker 1>government bureaucrat would have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>out there saying you don't have the </v>

3042
02:38:13.151 --> 02:38:13.151
<v Speaker 1>proper permits to do this.</v>

3043
02:38:13.151 --> 02:38:13.900
<v Speaker 1>And right now that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3044
02:38:14.150 --> 02:38:16.550
<v Speaker 1>one of the big obstacles is that we've </v>
<v Speaker 1>gotten.</v>

3045
02:38:16.551 --> 02:38:19.280
<v Speaker 1>We've got these top heavy political </v>
<v Speaker 1>systems that are really,</v>

3046
02:38:19.281 --> 02:38:22.970
<v Speaker 1>I think really encumbering the creative </v>
<v Speaker 1>process,</v>

3047
02:38:22.971 --> 02:38:26.770
<v Speaker 1>the evolutionary process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why I'm such a big supporter of,</v>

3048
02:38:26.880 --> 02:38:30.890
<v Speaker 1>of basically freedom in getting back to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea of,</v>

3049
02:38:30.930 --> 02:38:34.760
<v Speaker 1>of individual liberty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because think the upside of people being</v>

3050
02:38:34.761 --> 02:38:35.990
<v Speaker 1>free.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3051
02:38:35.991 --> 02:38:39.020
<v Speaker 1>of course there's a cost to freedom and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's going to be a downside to it.</v>

3052
02:38:39.021 --> 02:38:40.760
<v Speaker 1>But the upside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

3053
02:38:40.820 --> 02:38:45.820
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is so much greater than the downside </v>

3054
02:38:45.820 --> 02:38:46.700
<v Speaker 1>that led to what the internet is showing</v>
<v Speaker 1>the internet is.</v>

3055
02:38:46.870 --> 02:38:48.860
<v Speaker 1>It represents freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The free,</v>

3056
02:38:49.130 --> 02:38:51.740
<v Speaker 1>the ability to freely distribute </v>
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>

3057
02:38:52.130 --> 02:38:54.620
<v Speaker 1>This show itself would have never </v>
<v Speaker 1>existed.</v>

3058
02:38:55.040 --> 02:38:58.760
<v Speaker 1>This podcast could not have existed </v>
<v Speaker 1>without something like the internet.</v>

3059
02:38:58.761 --> 02:39:01.880
<v Speaker 1>No one would have ever given me a show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one would ever like said,</v>

3060
02:39:01.881 --> 02:39:06.881
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go talk to this guy from Georgia for </v>

3061
02:39:06.881 --> 02:39:07.190
<v Speaker 1>three hours about asteroid impacts.</v>

3062
02:39:07.220 --> 02:39:08.470
<v Speaker 1>People will like it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3063
02:39:08.870 --> 02:39:10.640
<v Speaker 1>get outta here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get the fuck out of here.</v>

3064
02:39:10.670 --> 02:39:11.750
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm from Minnesota.</v>

3065
02:39:11.780 --> 02:39:12.950
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you live there,</v>

3066
02:39:13.300 --> 02:39:18.300
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's just the whole idea is that </v>

3067
02:39:18.300 --> 02:39:20.060
<v Speaker 1>freedom allows people to innovate at a </v>
<v Speaker 1>much quicker pace.</v>

3068
02:39:20.480 --> 02:39:23.570
<v Speaker 1>It allows negative things too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But so does life itself.</v>

3069
02:39:23.571 --> 02:39:28.571
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's more of a chance of negative </v>

3070
02:39:28.571 --> 02:39:28.610
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If things are controlled,</v>

3071
02:39:28.970 --> 02:39:33.410
<v Speaker 1>if things are locked down and innovation</v>
<v Speaker 1>goes,</v>

3072
02:39:33.640 --> 02:39:36.740
<v Speaker 1>where does it goes right out in my own </v>
<v Speaker 1>personal sphere,</v>

3073
02:39:36.741 --> 02:39:39.960
<v Speaker 1>like 20 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I'm building a project right now in</v>

3074
02:39:39.980 --> 02:39:44.980
<v Speaker 1>atlanta.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Took me six months and nine trips down </v>

3075
02:39:44.980 --> 02:39:48.470
<v Speaker 1>to city hall to get permission from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bureaucrats to do a small project,</v>

3076
02:39:48.530 --> 02:39:53.530
<v Speaker 1>which 20 years ago I could have gotten </v>
<v Speaker 1>permission in an hour to 20 years before</v>

3077
02:39:54.021 --> 02:39:59.021
<v Speaker 1>that I didn't even would have been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would not have even needed permission </v>

3078
02:39:59.021 --> 02:39:59.021
<v Speaker 1>from anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3079
02:39:59.021 --> 02:40:00.050
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got your own house,</v>

3080
02:40:00.051 --> 02:40:02.000
<v Speaker 1>you want to do this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your neighbors don't care.</v>

3081
02:40:02.300 --> 02:40:03.210
<v Speaker 1>We'll do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

3082
02:40:04.080 --> 02:40:09.080
<v Speaker 1>so this is what my experience there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Multiply that by millions across the </v>

3083
02:40:09.471 --> 02:40:10.200
<v Speaker 1>board,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3084
02:40:10.250 --> 02:40:11.960
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3085
02:40:11.961 --> 02:40:13.410
<v Speaker 1>it's going to get to the point where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3086
02:40:13.411 --> 02:40:14.130
<v Speaker 1>can we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do</v>

3087
02:40:14.130 --> 02:40:18.600
<v Speaker 4>we dare breathe out without a permit </v>
<v Speaker 4>because we're exhaling carbon dioxide,</v>

3088
02:40:19.530 --> 02:40:20.910
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3089
02:40:21.270 --> 02:40:21.960
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3090
02:40:22.650 --> 02:40:23.580
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>

3091
02:40:23.610 --> 02:40:28.610
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that a couple of things need to </v>

3092
02:40:28.610 --> 02:40:28.610
<v Speaker 4>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One,</v>

3093
02:40:28.610 --> 02:40:30.030
<v Speaker 4>we need to really get back to the idea </v>
<v Speaker 4>and America,</v>

3094
02:40:30.031 --> 02:40:33.840
<v Speaker 4>that's the great dream and vision of </v>
<v Speaker 4>America was that this was supposed to be</v>

3095
02:40:33.841 --> 02:40:38.130
<v Speaker 4>the home of freedom on planet earth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>your bureaucracy is pretty disgusting,</v>

3096
02:40:38.131 --> 02:40:43.131
<v Speaker 4>but it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel like sometimes we need some </v>

3097
02:40:43.131 --> 02:40:44.520
<v Speaker 4>resistance in order to facilitate </v>
<v Speaker 4>action.</v>

3098
02:40:44.550 --> 02:40:45.780
<v Speaker 4>Some resistance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3099
02:40:45.781 --> 02:40:50.781
<v Speaker 4>And some resistance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes gives us this real desire to </v>

3100
02:40:50.781 --> 02:40:53.430
<v Speaker 4>overcome that resistance,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which makes innovation.</v>

3101
02:40:53.510 --> 02:40:54.290
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3102
02:40:54.300 --> 02:40:59.250
<v Speaker 4>and that might be one of the things that</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're experiencing with this new culture</v>

3103
02:40:59.251 --> 02:41:03.300
<v Speaker 4>that's emerging from the internet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's kind of emerging in response to the</v>

3104
02:41:03.301 --> 02:41:08.301
<v Speaker 4>resistance that we received from mean </v>
<v Speaker 4>going back to psychedelics from the </v>

3105
02:41:08.551 --> 02:41:13.551
<v Speaker 4>sixties and seventies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>seventies into the eighties and the </v>

3106
02:41:13.551 --> 02:41:13.551
<v Speaker 4>nineties.</v>

3107
02:41:13.551 --> 02:41:16.970
<v Speaker 4>The internet emerges and the internet is</v>
<v Speaker 4>causing this big pushback on all of the </v>

3108
02:41:17.431 --> 02:41:21.510
<v Speaker 4>archaic ideas of being promoted during </v>
<v Speaker 4>those dark decades.</v>

3109
02:41:22.950 --> 02:41:24.900
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I totally agree with you.</v>

3110
02:41:24.901 --> 02:41:26.460
<v Speaker 4>I mean without some resist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3111
02:41:26.940 --> 02:41:28.830
<v Speaker 4>after all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean if there's no resistance,</v>

3112
02:41:28.831 --> 02:41:29.120
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we.</v>

3113
02:41:29.160 --> 02:41:30.960
<v Speaker 4>We're going to basically turn it into </v>
<v Speaker 4>slugs.</v>

3114
02:41:31.020 --> 02:41:32.250
<v Speaker 4>We turned the couch,</v>
<v Speaker 4>potatoes,</v>

3115
02:41:32.280 --> 02:41:34.170
<v Speaker 4>we turned the couch with the lazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're lazy.</v>

3116
02:41:34.560 --> 02:41:39.560
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's very rare that human beings by </v>

3117
02:41:39.560 --> 02:41:41.811
<v Speaker 4>default are ambitious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like in response to something like </v>

3118
02:41:41.811 --> 02:41:46.640
<v Speaker 4>one of the worst things you could do to </v>
<v Speaker 4>a kid is give the kid everything they </v>

3119
02:41:46.640 --> 02:41:50.661
<v Speaker 4>want and not have them work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Though they'd never develop any </v>

3120
02:41:50.661 --> 02:41:52.590
<v Speaker 4>instincts to work towards things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They never develop any,</v>

3121
02:41:52.800 --> 02:41:57.800
<v Speaker 4>any instincts to recognize that there's </v>
<v Speaker 4>a benefit to struggling and being </v>

3122
02:41:58.291 --> 02:42:03.291
<v Speaker 4>uncomfortable and that the rewards when,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you have a hard day's work and a </v>

3123
02:42:04.200 --> 02:42:06.630
<v Speaker 4>job completed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that you feel satisfied,</v>

3124
02:42:06.631 --> 02:42:09.420
<v Speaker 4>but then the beer tastes so much better,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so much better.</v>

3125
02:42:09.960 --> 02:42:11.880
<v Speaker 4>The jewish cabela's have a term for </v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

3126
02:42:11.881 --> 02:42:16.881
<v Speaker 4>which I can't remember,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it translates as the bread of shame </v>

3127
02:42:16.881 --> 02:42:20.120
<v Speaker 4>and it's like the bread of shame is the </v>
<v Speaker 4>bread you get that you didn't really </v>

3128
02:42:20.120 --> 02:42:20.120
<v Speaker 4>have to work for.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You didn't have to struggle,</v>

3129
02:42:20.120 --> 02:42:21.810
<v Speaker 4>you didn't have to put forward any </v>
<v Speaker 4>effort.</v>

3130
02:42:21.811 --> 02:42:23.780
<v Speaker 4>It's just given to you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3131
02:42:24.090 --> 02:42:24.580
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

3132
02:42:24.640 --> 02:42:25.350
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3133
02:42:25.351 --> 02:42:30.330
<v Speaker 4>it's like one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the stories that kind of goes along with</v>

3134
02:42:30.331 --> 02:42:31.840
<v Speaker 4>presenting that as,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3135
02:42:31.900 --> 02:42:32.540
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

3136
02:42:32.900 --> 02:42:35.790
<v Speaker 4>the man who builds up this great </v>
<v Speaker 4>business empire,</v>

3137
02:42:35.791 --> 02:42:37.970
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then you know,</v>

3138
02:42:38.070 --> 02:42:43.070
<v Speaker 4>he's getting ready to retire and he </v>
<v Speaker 4>wants to pass it onto his son and he </v>

3139
02:42:43.070 --> 02:42:43.070
<v Speaker 4>says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3140
02:42:43.070 --> 02:42:46.110
<v Speaker 4>come in and I'm going to make you ceo of</v>
<v Speaker 4>my business empire in the hole.</v>

3141
02:42:46.170 --> 02:42:47.430
<v Speaker 4>You're going to be Able to run the whole</v>
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>

3142
02:42:47.431 --> 02:42:48.150
<v Speaker 4>And the son says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

3143
02:42:48.151 --> 02:42:48.990
<v Speaker 4>thanks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want,</v>

3144
02:42:48.991 --> 02:42:49.380
<v Speaker 4>and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

3145
02:42:49.381 --> 02:42:50.790
<v Speaker 4>what do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He says,</v>

3146
02:42:50.791 --> 02:42:55.791
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let me start at the bottom and work my </v>

3147
02:42:55.791 --> 02:42:57.000
<v Speaker 4>way up and earn that position and it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to mean a whole lot more to me and</v>

3148
02:42:57.001 --> 02:43:02.001
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to be a hell of a lot more </v>
<v Speaker 4>effective in that position and if it's </v>

3149
02:43:02.001 --> 02:43:05.211
<v Speaker 4>just dumped in my lap.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just so rare that anybody has that </v>

3150
02:43:05.211 --> 02:43:07.260
<v Speaker 4>mentality though most people would take </v>
<v Speaker 4>the easy road every single time.</v>

3151
02:43:07.680 --> 02:43:10.140
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that is to the consternation,</v>

3152
02:43:10.141 --> 02:43:12.040
<v Speaker 4>I think of our who didn't look at it</v>

3153
02:43:12.040 --> 02:43:15.040
<v Speaker 1>that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know the people that came across the</v>

3154
02:43:15.041 --> 02:43:17.200
<v Speaker 1>ocean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it great hardship,</v>

3155
02:43:17.201 --> 02:43:22.201
<v Speaker 1>didn't look at it that way and I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they would be pretty much rolling </v>

3156
02:43:22.201 --> 02:43:24.070
<v Speaker 1>in their graves if they could see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what's basically,</v>

3157
02:43:24.100 --> 02:43:29.100
<v Speaker 1>oh well we'll let you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll just let the government take care </v>

3158
02:43:29.100 --> 02:43:31.531
<v Speaker 1>of us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have to get a job because the </v>

3159
02:43:31.531 --> 02:43:34.081
<v Speaker 1>government's going to take care of us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they would also look at our </v>

3160
02:43:34.081 --> 02:43:34.081
<v Speaker 1>computers and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>holy shit,</v>

3161
02:43:34.081 --> 02:43:35.270
<v Speaker 1>you guys have figured some thIngs out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God.</v>

3162
02:43:35.710 --> 02:43:36.460
<v Speaker 1>Wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hold on.</v>

3163
02:43:36.461 --> 02:43:39.520
<v Speaker 1>You asked a question to your phone and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it gives you the answer.</v>

3164
02:43:40.340 --> 02:43:45.340
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they never even thought about that on </v>

3165
02:43:45.340 --> 02:43:46.981
<v Speaker 1>star trek and and see what that does is </v>
<v Speaker 1>it shows there's 30 these parallel </v>

3166
02:43:46.981 --> 02:43:47.710
<v Speaker 1>trends that are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are happening,</v>

3167
02:43:47.770 --> 02:43:48.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so yeah,</v>

3168
02:43:48.671 --> 02:43:49.280
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

3169
02:43:49.710 --> 02:43:52.180
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why I tend to be more optimistic.</v>

3170
02:43:52.180 --> 02:43:53.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a pessimist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3171
02:43:53.461 --> 02:43:56.080
<v Speaker 1>I have great hopes for her future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do too.</v>

3172
02:43:56.081 --> 02:44:01.081
<v Speaker 1>And people give me a hard time for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you think I'm unrealistic or </v>

3173
02:44:01.081 --> 02:44:04.810
<v Speaker 1>the hippie side of me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hippie ideology as well.</v>

3174
02:44:05.620 --> 02:44:09.010
<v Speaker 1>The sacred geometry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sacred geometry name.</v>

3175
02:44:09.011 --> 02:44:11.590
<v Speaker 1>Like why did you choose that as the name</v>
<v Speaker 1>for your website?</v>

3176
02:44:11.680 --> 02:44:16.680
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because at the time I was looking at </v>

3177
02:44:16.680 --> 02:44:19.500
<v Speaker 1>there was so much interest and because I</v>
<v Speaker 1>saw it as a venue for putting </v>

3178
02:44:19.811 --> 02:44:23.650
<v Speaker 1>information out there about that and </v>
<v Speaker 1>showing some of the amazing correlations</v>

3179
02:44:23.651 --> 02:44:28.651
<v Speaker 1>and linkages between the subject of </v>
<v Speaker 1>geometry and so many of these other </v>

3180
02:44:29.321 --> 02:44:30.040
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>

3181
02:44:30.041 --> 02:44:31.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mayan temples,</v>

3182
02:44:31.751 --> 02:44:36.751
<v Speaker 1>egyptian structures in helping,</v>
<v Speaker 1>using that as a key to decipher or </v>

3183
02:44:37.061 --> 02:44:42.061
<v Speaker 1>decode these messages that have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>have been embodied in architecture.</v>

3184
02:44:43.840 --> 02:44:45.710
<v Speaker 1>It's the key.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a master,</v>

3185
02:44:45.720 --> 02:44:48.760
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the master keys to decoding </v>
<v Speaker 1>the archaic,</v>

3186
02:44:48.761 --> 02:44:49.900
<v Speaker 1>true wisdom tradition.</v>

3187
02:44:49.990 --> 02:44:52.720
<v Speaker 1>There's no question and geometry </v>
<v Speaker 1>pervades everything.</v>

3188
02:44:52.780 --> 02:44:55.000
<v Speaker 1>I mean geometry pervades,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3189
02:44:55.300 --> 02:45:00.300
<v Speaker 1>we can actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can show you now studies that have </v>

3190
02:45:00.300 --> 02:45:00.640
<v Speaker 1>shown that the exact architecture of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>solar system,</v>

3191
02:45:00.641 --> 02:45:04.480
<v Speaker 1>if you change it even a little Bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>none of this could happen,</v>

3192
02:45:04.680 --> 02:45:06.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because as it is now,</v>

3193
02:45:06.101 --> 02:45:11.101
<v Speaker 1>you have this great reservoir of </v>
<v Speaker 1>comments outside the orbit of neptune </v>

3194
02:45:11.101 --> 02:45:14.200
<v Speaker 1>called the kuyper disk right at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>inside of that,</v>

3195
02:45:14.201 --> 02:45:16.360
<v Speaker 1>an inner perimeter of that disk of </v>
<v Speaker 1>comets,</v>

3196
02:45:17.490 --> 02:45:20.710
<v Speaker 1>commentary in stable condition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

3197
02:45:20.950 --> 02:45:23.860
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't take much to perturb them </v>
<v Speaker 1>from that position,</v>

3198
02:45:24.550 --> 02:45:27.370
<v Speaker 1>but at the same tIme there isn't much </v>
<v Speaker 1>there to perturb them,</v>

3199
02:45:27.400 --> 02:45:30.580
<v Speaker 1>so they generally are just slowly </v>
<v Speaker 1>orbiting the sun.</v>

3200
02:45:31.290 --> 02:45:36.290
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens is conjunctions of the </v>

3201
02:45:36.290 --> 02:45:38.670
<v Speaker 1>outer planets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uranus and neptune primarily the </v>

3202
02:45:38.670 --> 02:45:42.181
<v Speaker 1>combined gravitational forces exerted on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the inner part of the kuyper disk or </v>

3203
02:45:42.181 --> 02:45:46.201
<v Speaker 1>enough to dislodge comments and send </v>
<v Speaker 1>them either either the gravity effect.</v>

3204
02:45:46.540 --> 02:45:48.910
<v Speaker 1>Think of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you've got a gravity effect,</v>

3205
02:45:48.911 --> 02:45:51.520
<v Speaker 1>polling on something from behind and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's moving this way,</v>

3206
02:45:51.521 --> 02:45:53.680
<v Speaker 1>it's going to act as a breaking </v>
<v Speaker 1>mechanism.</v>

3207
02:45:53.950 --> 02:45:58.950
<v Speaker 1>If it's a head in drawing on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to act as an accelerating </v>

3208
02:45:58.950 --> 02:46:02.611
<v Speaker 1>mechanism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if you accelerate one of these </v>

3209
02:46:02.611 --> 02:46:03.100
<v Speaker 1>objects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it moves out further from the sun.</v>

3210
02:46:03.340 --> 02:46:06.670
<v Speaker 1>If you decelerate it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it moves in closer to the sun.</v>

3211
02:46:07.240 --> 02:46:12.240
<v Speaker 1>What happens is is that the conjunction </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the outer planets can move these </v>

3212
02:46:12.240 --> 02:46:17.111
<v Speaker 1>comments inside the the become within </v>
<v Speaker 1>the sphere of influence of the planets </v>

3213
02:46:17.360 --> 02:46:22.360
<v Speaker 1>and it just so happens in an </v>
<v Speaker 1>astrophysicist have worked out the </v>

3214
02:46:22.360 --> 02:46:26.321
<v Speaker 1>mathematics of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the masses and the spacing of the </v>

3215
02:46:26.321 --> 02:46:26.930
<v Speaker 1>four great outer planets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jupiter,</v>

3216
02:46:26.931 --> 02:46:27.740
<v Speaker 1>saturn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uranus,</v>

3217
02:46:27.741 --> 02:46:32.741
<v Speaker 1>and neptune are exactly what they need </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be to transport comments from the </v>

3218
02:46:33.321 --> 02:46:38.321
<v Speaker 1>kuyper disk to the inner solar system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you change that even a little </v>

3219
02:46:38.321 --> 02:46:39.020
<v Speaker 1>bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would lose this.</v>

3220
02:46:39.020 --> 02:46:44.020
<v Speaker 1>They've referred to it as the the bucket</v>
<v Speaker 1>mechanism or the like a bucket handoff.</v>

3221
02:46:46.250 --> 02:46:51.250
<v Speaker 1>Each planet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll hand off the comet to the next </v>

3222
02:46:51.250 --> 02:46:51.250
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then when it gets to jupiter,</v>

3223
02:46:51.250 --> 02:46:52.190
<v Speaker 1>the big one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you said earlier,</v>

3224
02:46:52.580 --> 02:46:57.580
<v Speaker 1>jupiter is either going to accelerate it</v>
<v Speaker 1>and throw it back out or it's going to </v>

3225
02:46:57.580 --> 02:46:58.340
<v Speaker 1>decelerate it and send it in towards the</v>
<v Speaker 1>sun.</v>

3226
02:46:58.341 --> 02:47:03.341
<v Speaker 1>Work becomes an earth crosser where it </v>
<v Speaker 1>begins to desegregate and into process,</v>

3227
02:47:04.640 --> 02:47:07.880
<v Speaker 1>fertilize the earth with its </v>
<v Speaker 1>constituents,</v>

3228
02:47:08.180 --> 02:47:13.010
<v Speaker 1>which we now know are all kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting and exotic materials,</v>

3229
02:47:13.730 --> 02:47:17.290
<v Speaker 1>so if it turns out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it almost certainly will in terms of</v>

3230
02:47:17.340 --> 02:47:22.340
<v Speaker 1>the panspermia idea that that life was </v>
<v Speaker 1>originated on earth by comments that you</v>

3231
02:47:23.331 --> 02:47:25.580
<v Speaker 1>had to have an environment that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>conducive.</v>

3232
02:47:25.690 --> 02:47:30.690
<v Speaker 1>You had to have this matrix of </v>
<v Speaker 1>environmental conditions that if were </v>

3233
02:47:30.690 --> 02:47:33.941
<v Speaker 1>altered slightly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would not allow the proliferation of </v>

3234
02:47:33.941 --> 02:47:33.941
<v Speaker 1>higher life.</v>

3235
02:47:33.941 --> 02:47:36.290
<v Speaker 1>You now have the introduction of </v>
<v Speaker 1>cometary material into that.</v>

3236
02:47:36.350 --> 02:47:41.350
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the architecture of the outer solar </v>

3237
02:47:41.350 --> 02:47:41.810
<v Speaker 1>system was not exactly lined up into </v>
<v Speaker 1>geometry that it is,</v>

3238
02:47:42.470 --> 02:47:47.470
<v Speaker 1>then you would never have that delivery </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the organics and the volatiles from </v>

3239
02:47:47.470 --> 02:47:48.200
<v Speaker 1>the comet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's Backed.</v>

3240
02:47:48.201 --> 02:47:53.201
<v Speaker 1>It's likely that the oceans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the hydrosphere originated from </v>

3241
02:47:53.201 --> 02:47:55.550
<v Speaker 1>space without the oceans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where would life on earth be?</v>

3242
02:47:55.640 --> 02:47:58.430
<v Speaker 1>You see now here's where it gets </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>

3243
02:47:58.850 --> 02:48:03.740
<v Speaker 1>The architecture of the solar system is </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's condensed and embodied within the</v>

3244
02:48:03.741 --> 02:48:08.360
<v Speaker 1>sacred architecture of old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they've taken that those proportion,</v>

3245
02:48:08.361 --> 02:48:12.590
<v Speaker 1>however that got there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether they knew it directly or on some</v>

3246
02:48:12.650 --> 02:48:17.650
<v Speaker 1>subconscious level and incorporated that</v>
<v Speaker 1>into the designs and the proportions of </v>

3247
02:48:17.650 --> 02:48:19.790
<v Speaker 1>the ancient sacred structures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's there.</v>

3248
02:48:20.210 --> 02:48:25.210
<v Speaker 1>Basically the model of the holy city,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the new jerusalem is described in the </v>

3249
02:48:25.210 --> 02:48:29.740
<v Speaker 1>book of revelations is basically a model</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the solar system architecture,</v>

3250
02:48:30.710 --> 02:48:33.560
<v Speaker 1>so it abides by bodes law.</v>

3251
02:48:33.650 --> 02:48:35.570
<v Speaker 1>Is that what it is?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

3252
02:48:35.660 --> 02:48:37.700
<v Speaker 1>I think it's bid day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's how you say it,</v>

3253
02:48:37.840 --> 02:48:40.070
<v Speaker 1>but god,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would just be,</v>

3254
02:48:40.071 --> 02:48:40.460
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>d,</v>

3255
02:48:40.461 --> 02:48:41.990
<v Speaker 1>e,</v>
<v Speaker 1>b o d o.</v>

3256
02:48:41.991 --> 02:48:46.991
<v Speaker 1>It's bowed day and I've only seen it </v>
<v Speaker 1>written and the lobbying that the size </v>

3257
02:48:48.711 --> 02:48:53.711
<v Speaker 1>and mass of a planet allows you to </v>
<v Speaker 1>extrapolate and find out how big and far</v>

3258
02:48:55.101 --> 02:48:58.130
<v Speaker 1>away the next planet would be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so yeah,</v>

3259
02:48:58.550 --> 02:49:01.640
<v Speaker 1>it shows up that one of the intervals </v>
<v Speaker 1>within that sequences,</v>

3260
02:49:01.760 --> 02:49:03.910
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where the asteroid belt is [inaudible],</v>

3261
02:49:03.980 --> 02:49:05.990
<v Speaker 1>there's no planet there there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's an asteroid,</v>

3262
02:49:06.020 --> 02:49:08.880
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's of coincides with the ancient</v>

3263
02:49:08.881 --> 02:49:13.881
<v Speaker 1>sumerian myth of the creation of earth </v>
<v Speaker 1>being an impact that there was an also </v>

3264
02:49:14.490 --> 02:49:18.390
<v Speaker 1>earth and earth to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They know that earth was at one point in</v>

3265
02:49:18.391 --> 02:49:22.650
<v Speaker 1>time different and it was impacted and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's also what created the moon,</v>

3266
02:49:22.800 --> 02:49:23.670
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3267
02:49:23.820 --> 02:49:26.130
<v Speaker 1>Well that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the theory about the moon,</v>

3268
02:49:26.131 --> 02:49:31.131
<v Speaker 1>but the moon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the moon is really something we could </v>

3269
02:49:31.131 --> 02:49:34.851
<v Speaker 1>talk about for the next hour and we can </v>
<v Speaker 1>save that for a future broadcast,</v>

3270
02:49:35.521 --> 02:49:40.521
<v Speaker 1>but the moon is really one of the grand </v>
<v Speaker 1>symbols of the great mysteries with a </v>

3271
02:49:40.521 --> 02:49:41.010
<v Speaker 1>capital lamp.</v>

3272
02:49:41.010 --> 02:49:43.710
<v Speaker 1>No question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's right there every night.</v>

3273
02:49:43.711 --> 02:49:44.160
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right now,</v>

3274
02:49:44.161 --> 02:49:47.370
<v Speaker 1>I think we're one day away from the full</v>
<v Speaker 1>moon right now as we're sitting here,</v>

3275
02:49:47.371 --> 02:49:52.371
<v Speaker 1>and I would highly recommend that </v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody listening to this go out and </v>

3276
02:49:52.371 --> 02:49:56.241
<v Speaker 1>begin contemplating the moon unless </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're afraid of werewolf's unless </v>

3277
02:49:56.241 --> 02:50:00.321
<v Speaker 1>you're afraid of where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you're afraid of becoming </v>

3278
02:50:00.321 --> 02:50:01.600
<v Speaker 1>transformed into a werewolf.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3279
02:50:02.160 --> 02:50:03.240
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>

3280
02:50:03.300 --> 02:50:08.100
<v Speaker 1>the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How is jerusalem designed representation</v>

3281
02:50:08.550 --> 02:50:11.420
<v Speaker 1>as a representation of the solar system?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3282
02:50:11.490 --> 02:50:12.490
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3283
02:50:12.520 --> 02:50:14.730
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hypothetical jerusalem,</v>

3284
02:50:14.880 --> 02:50:19.380
<v Speaker 1>the new jerusalem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well describes this layout.</v>

3285
02:50:21.090 --> 02:50:23.660
<v Speaker 1>It gets complex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>

3286
02:50:24.120 --> 02:50:29.120
<v Speaker 1>when I show this to people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I usually rely on a lot of graphs and </v>

3287
02:50:29.120 --> 02:50:31.740
<v Speaker 1>images and reproductions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>geometric diagrams and so on.</v>

3288
02:50:32.220 --> 02:50:34.770
<v Speaker 1>But basically it's describing tHe city </v>
<v Speaker 1>lies four square,</v>

3289
02:50:34.771 --> 02:50:39.771
<v Speaker 1>the length,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the height and the breadth of it or </v>

3290
02:50:39.771 --> 02:50:39.771
<v Speaker 1>equal 12,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>furlongs.</v>

3291
02:50:39.771 --> 02:50:41.820
<v Speaker 1>And there's a walgreens and high 144 </v>
<v Speaker 1>cubits according to the measure of a man</v>

3292
02:50:41.821 --> 02:50:42.900
<v Speaker 1>that is of the angel.</v>

3293
02:50:43.590 --> 02:50:45.390
<v Speaker 1>And then it goes on to describe other </v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

3294
02:50:45.391 --> 02:50:49.560
<v Speaker 1>but it's when you begin to begin to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>the analysis of these numbers,</v>

3295
02:50:49.561 --> 02:50:52.780
<v Speaker 1>you discover it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It opens up this whole world of,</v>

3296
02:50:52.800 --> 02:50:57.390
<v Speaker 1>of numerical symbolism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>the 12,000</v>

3297
02:50:57.391 --> 02:50:58.470
<v Speaker 1>furlongs you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>

3298
02:50:58.471 --> 02:50:58.860
<v Speaker 1>how much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3299
02:50:58.861 --> 02:51:02.130
<v Speaker 1>furlong is no a long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one eighth of a mile.</v>

3300
02:51:02.131 --> 02:51:07.131
<v Speaker 1>It still exists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's in very ancient unit of </v>

3301
02:51:07.131 --> 02:51:07.131
<v Speaker 1>measurement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Still exists.</v>

3302
02:51:07.131 --> 02:51:07.980
<v Speaker 1>It's used in horse racing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the one place that I know of.</v>

3303
02:51:07.981 --> 02:51:12.981
<v Speaker 1>It's still exists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One eighth of a mile at 660 feet right </v>

3304
02:51:12.981 --> 02:51:14.280
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you were to take the earth,</v>

3305
02:51:15.480 --> 02:51:16.210
<v Speaker 1>the earth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3306
02:51:16.230 --> 02:51:18.690
<v Speaker 1>it's an oblique spheroid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It spins on its axis,</v>

3307
02:51:18.691 --> 02:51:22.470
<v Speaker 1>so it bulges towards the equator,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shrinks towards the polar axis.</v>

3308
02:51:22.471 --> 02:51:26.070
<v Speaker 1>So the difference is about 7,900</v>
<v Speaker 1>miles at the polar axis,</v>

3309
02:51:26.400 --> 02:51:30.030
<v Speaker 1>about 7,926</v>
<v Speaker 1>miles at the equatorial access.</v>

3310
02:51:30.480 --> 02:51:34.170
<v Speaker 1>But if you were to take a perfect sphere</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the same area,</v>

3311
02:51:34.171 --> 02:51:39.171
<v Speaker 1>surface area is the earth actually has </v>
<v Speaker 1>that sphere would be 7,920</v>

3312
02:51:39.361 --> 02:51:44.361
<v Speaker 1>miles in diameter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that number 797920th.</v>

3313
02:51:45.260 --> 02:51:48.330
<v Speaker 1>A very interesting number because for </v>
<v Speaker 1>one thing,</v>

3314
02:51:48.840 --> 02:51:52.500
<v Speaker 1>if we look at a furlong furlong is 660 </v>
<v Speaker 1>feet.</v>

3315
02:51:53.190 --> 02:51:56.360
<v Speaker 1>So I'm putting 660.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you take that calculated?</v>

3316
02:51:56.370 --> 02:51:57.350
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3317
02:51:57.810 --> 02:52:02.810
<v Speaker 1>Now that's a furlong 660 feet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Convert that to inches by going times 12</v>

3318
02:52:04.470 --> 02:52:05.950
<v Speaker 1>times times 12,</v>

3319
02:52:06.240 --> 02:52:07.540
<v Speaker 3>one slash two.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

3320
02:52:07.750 --> 02:52:11.950
<v Speaker 3>and equals equals seven.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nine,</v>

3321
02:52:11.980 --> 02:52:13.600
<v Speaker 3>two zero.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There it is.</v>

3322
02:52:14.020 --> 02:52:16.780
<v Speaker 3>Diameter of the earth and miles that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>just said,</v>

3323
02:52:16.990 --> 02:52:17.790
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

3324
02:52:17.850 --> 02:52:18.250
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

3325
02:52:18.310 --> 02:52:23.310
<v Speaker 3>the perfect sphere that would have the </v>
<v Speaker 3>same surface area and the same volume is</v>

3326
02:52:23.471 --> 02:52:25.630
<v Speaker 3>the earth is 7,920</v>
<v Speaker 3>miles.</v>

3327
02:52:25.631 --> 02:52:28.060
<v Speaker 3>That's and that's actually the the </v>
<v Speaker 3>diameter of the earth.</v>

3328
02:52:28.360 --> 02:52:31.120
<v Speaker 3>If you took a line from the tropic of </v>
<v Speaker 3>cancer,</v>

3329
02:52:31.330 --> 02:52:35.260
<v Speaker 3>23 and a half degrees north through the </v>
<v Speaker 3>earth to the tropic of capricorn,</v>

3330
02:52:35.680 --> 02:52:39.070
<v Speaker 3>you would discover that that diameter is</v>
<v Speaker 3>about 7,920</v>

3331
02:52:39.071 --> 02:52:44.071
<v Speaker 3>miles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the number which I'm theorizing </v>

3332
02:52:44.071 --> 02:52:47.931
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm thinking with a lot of evidence </v>

3333
02:52:47.931 --> 02:52:49.420
<v Speaker 3>to back up that ancient peoples use to </v>
<v Speaker 3>symbolize the earth.</v>

3334
02:52:49.480 --> 02:52:54.480
<v Speaker 3>Seven thousand 920.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what you've just seen here is that </v>

3335
02:52:54.480 --> 02:52:55.420
<v Speaker 3>this ancient unit of measurement called </v>
<v Speaker 3>the furlong,</v>

3336
02:52:55.570 --> 02:53:00.570
<v Speaker 3>which is 660 feet is to the inch exactly</v>
<v Speaker 3>as the earth is to the mile.</v>

3337
02:53:02.980 --> 02:53:04.660
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what was the origin of the mile?</v>

3338
02:53:05.190 --> 02:53:08.200
<v Speaker 3>WHere did this myra,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we see we brought it up earlier,</v>

3339
02:53:08.920 --> 02:53:11.740
<v Speaker 3>length of the mile.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Five thousand 280 feet,</v>

3340
02:53:12.050 --> 02:53:13.540
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's the.</v>

3341
02:53:13.541 --> 02:53:16.390
<v Speaker 3>Or think about the latin word mill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does that mean?</v>

3342
02:53:16.780 --> 02:53:17.980
<v Speaker 3>A thousand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3343
02:53:18.570 --> 02:53:23.570
<v Speaker 3>Like a million is a thousand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thousands of a millimeter is 1000th of a</v>

3344
02:53:24.431 --> 02:53:25.330
<v Speaker 3>meter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3345
02:53:25.750 --> 02:53:28.380
<v Speaker 3>Because they're prefixing mil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The middle,</v>

3346
02:53:28.400 --> 02:53:31.090
<v Speaker 3>the latin prefix,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that means a thousand,</v>

3347
02:53:31.330 --> 02:53:36.330
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's where the actual word mild </v>

3348
02:53:36.330 --> 02:53:38.620
<v Speaker 3>comes from.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So a mile is a thousand what?</v>

3349
02:53:39.580 --> 02:53:41.890
<v Speaker 3>So thousand paces.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Human paces.</v>

3350
02:53:42.220 --> 02:53:46.210
<v Speaker 3>So if you were to go out and walk off a </v>
<v Speaker 3>thousand paces,</v>

3351
02:53:47.050 --> 02:53:49.360
<v Speaker 3>say counting every time your right foot </v>
<v Speaker 3>hit the ground,</v>

3352
02:53:50.660 --> 02:53:54.070
<v Speaker 3>you did add a thousand times,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to have a mile more or less</v>

3353
02:53:54.071 --> 02:53:55.930
<v Speaker 3>depending on your size.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3354
02:53:55.931 --> 02:54:00.931
<v Speaker 3>I'm six foot one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I'm going to have a slightly longer </v>

3355
02:54:00.931 --> 02:54:00.931
<v Speaker 3>pace than somebody who's five foot five.</v>

3356
02:54:00.931 --> 02:54:05.580
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's where the origin of the mild </v>

3357
02:54:05.580 --> 02:54:05.750
<v Speaker 3>comes from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from 5,000</v>

3358
02:54:05.970 --> 02:54:08.790
<v Speaker 3>from a thousand paces.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And given that the,</v>

3359
02:54:08.920 --> 02:54:10.270
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that standardized,</v>

3360
02:54:10.271 --> 02:54:11.530
<v Speaker 3>but it's very ancient.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Safe.</v>

3361
02:54:12.220 --> 02:54:15.610
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the outer circle of stonehenge,</v>

3362
02:54:15.670 --> 02:54:20.670
<v Speaker 3>the sarsens stone circle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you were to encompass it in a circle </v>

3363
02:54:20.670 --> 02:54:22.960
<v Speaker 3>that just tangent to the outer faces of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the stone,</v>

3364
02:54:23.590 --> 02:54:26.710
<v Speaker 3>the radius of that circle is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>has been,</v>

3365
02:54:26.890 --> 02:54:31.890
<v Speaker 3>has been measured,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's almost exactly 52 point eight </v>

3366
02:54:31.890 --> 02:54:34.840
<v Speaker 3>feet right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or 100 of a mile.</v>

3367
02:54:35.980 --> 02:54:38.500
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you take the diameter of stonehenge,</v>

3368
02:54:38.501 --> 02:54:41.620
<v Speaker 3>it's a double it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is 105 point six feet,</v>

3369
02:54:42.640 --> 02:54:47.140
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>50 times 100 point 105 point six.</v>

3370
02:54:47.170 --> 02:54:51.310
<v Speaker 3>There's your mile.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It suggests that the mile was being used</v>

3371
02:54:51.340 --> 02:54:55.570
<v Speaker 3>by those who built stonehenge 5,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago,</v>

3372
02:54:56.140 --> 02:55:01.140
<v Speaker 3>but you see this number five,</v>
<v Speaker 3>point two eight is a universal </v>

3373
02:55:01.140 --> 02:55:02.500
<v Speaker 3>relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It it.</v>

3374
02:55:02.680 --> 02:55:04.160
<v Speaker 3>For one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it says</v>

3375
02:55:04.670 --> 02:55:08.090
<v Speaker 1>the average human pace related to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>foot,</v>

3376
02:55:08.330 --> 02:55:13.330
<v Speaker 1>which again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>remember protocols said man is the </v>

3377
02:55:13.330 --> 02:55:13.330
<v Speaker 1>measure of all things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3378
02:55:13.760 --> 02:55:16.040
<v Speaker 1>Where comes the inch?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's this.</v>

3379
02:55:16.100 --> 02:55:18.200
<v Speaker 1>Here's the x right here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The origin of the inch.</v>

3380
02:55:18.230 --> 02:55:20.520
<v Speaker 1>The distance between your thumb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3381
02:55:20.660 --> 02:55:22.790
<v Speaker 1>or it's already width of your thumb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's this.</v>

3382
02:55:22.820 --> 02:55:23.240
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3383
02:55:23.260 --> 02:55:25.370
<v Speaker 1>so you can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can measure here and that's going to</v>

3384
02:55:25.371 --> 02:55:29.810
<v Speaker 1>be an inch or you can take this and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's an inch as well.</v>

3385
02:55:29.930 --> 02:55:30.980
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

3386
02:55:31.040 --> 02:55:34.040
<v Speaker 1>so it's the tip of your thumb to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>first joint.</v>

3387
02:55:34.250 --> 02:55:35.860
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As essentially an.</v>

3388
02:55:35.930 --> 02:55:38.690
<v Speaker 1>And it depends because obviously you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to size,</v>

3389
02:55:38.840 --> 02:55:39.650
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3390
02:55:40.010 --> 02:55:45.010
<v Speaker 1>But the idea here is that the units of </v>
<v Speaker 1>ancient measurement derive from one of </v>

3391
02:55:45.010 --> 02:55:49.721
<v Speaker 1>two sources from the human yard stick or</v>
<v Speaker 1>the earth itself.</v>

3392
02:55:50.000 --> 02:55:55.000
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so now if you take the average human </v>

3393
02:55:55.000 --> 02:55:58.160
<v Speaker 1>pace divided by the average human foot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's five point two eight,</v>

3394
02:55:58.700 --> 02:56:01.550
<v Speaker 1>multiply that by a thousand and you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mile of 5,000,</v>

3395
02:56:01.551 --> 02:56:02.660
<v Speaker 1>280 feet.</v>

3396
02:56:03.020 --> 02:56:08.020
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm suggesting that that unit of </v>

3397
02:56:08.020 --> 02:56:11.060
<v Speaker 1>measurement was actually incorporated </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the design of stonehenge.</v>

3398
02:56:11.390 --> 02:56:16.390
<v Speaker 1>Right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we have just seen is that the </v>

3399
02:56:16.390 --> 02:56:19.091
<v Speaker 1>description of the new jerusalem in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>book of revelations describes it as </v>

3400
02:56:19.091 --> 02:56:21.050
<v Speaker 1>being 12,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>furlongs,</v>

3401
02:56:21.500 --> 02:56:23.840
<v Speaker 1>which again is an ancient british </v>
<v Speaker 1>unitive measurement,</v>

3402
02:56:24.320 --> 02:56:29.320
<v Speaker 1>but probably used way beyond britain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when we look at the ratio of the </v>

3403
02:56:29.320 --> 02:56:34.241
<v Speaker 1>furlong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we took out in the parking lot here </v>

3404
02:56:34.241 --> 02:56:37.430
<v Speaker 1>and laid out a furlong 660 feet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then marked off one inch on it,</v>

3405
02:56:37.970 --> 02:56:42.970
<v Speaker 1>that furlong to that inch would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly the same as the diameter of the </v>

3406
02:56:42.970 --> 02:56:47.171
<v Speaker 1>earth to the mile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now in in the book of revelations,</v>

3407
02:56:47.600 --> 02:56:50.830
<v Speaker 1>what it says is that the new jerusalem </v>
<v Speaker 1>is 12,000</v>

3408
02:56:50.930 --> 02:56:54.650
<v Speaker 1>of these furlongs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you take 660,</v>

3409
02:56:55.490 --> 02:57:00.490
<v Speaker 1>which I put in there times 12,000,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at the number that comes up again,</v>

3410
02:57:03.590 --> 02:57:04.760
<v Speaker 1>there's a number again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven,</v>

3411
02:57:04.761 --> 02:57:05.780
<v Speaker 1>nine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two zero,</v>

3412
02:57:05.810 --> 02:57:06.720
<v Speaker 1>zero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>zero.</v>

3413
02:57:07.490 --> 02:57:09.270
<v Speaker 1>But it's been raised by orders of </v>
<v Speaker 1>magnitude.</v>

3414
02:57:09.280 --> 02:57:13.100
<v Speaker 1>Now divide that by the number of feet in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a mile.</v>

3415
02:57:13.340 --> 02:57:17.930
<v Speaker 1>Put the divide button here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>divide by 5,280</v>

3416
02:57:18.650 --> 02:57:23.650
<v Speaker 1>divided by 5,280.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there is what they're describing a </v>

3417
02:57:24.921 --> 02:57:28.790
<v Speaker 1>body that's 1500 miles in diameter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3418
02:57:29.570 --> 02:57:32.300
<v Speaker 1>So what is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is 1500 miles in diameter?</v>

3419
02:57:32.390 --> 02:57:33.950
<v Speaker 1>That's the mystery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

3420
02:57:34.250 --> 02:57:39.050
<v Speaker 1>if you take that number,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm going to go to the earth itself,</v>

3421
02:57:39.051 --> 02:57:43.190
<v Speaker 1>79 slash 20 and divided by the new </v>
<v Speaker 1>jerusalem,</v>

3422
02:57:43.430 --> 02:57:48.430
<v Speaker 1>divide by 1500.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's the ratio.</v>

3423
02:57:48.831 --> 02:57:53.210
<v Speaker 1>We get the human pace to the human foot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

3424
02:57:54.260 --> 02:57:59.260
<v Speaker 1>Coincidence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or are we beginning to see that there's </v>

3425
02:57:59.260 --> 02:58:00.530
<v Speaker 1>an underlying pattern now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Five to eight,</v>

3426
02:58:00.890 --> 02:58:01.770
<v Speaker 1>five to eight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so</v>

3427
02:58:02.100 --> 02:58:03.840
<v Speaker 3>the ratio is there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3428
02:58:03.930 --> 02:58:08.930
<v Speaker 3>I'm not making any of this up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you either dismiss it as coincidence </v>

3429
02:58:08.930 --> 02:58:08.930
<v Speaker 3>or you go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

3430
02:58:08.930 --> 02:58:12.600
<v Speaker 3>there's an underlying pattern here and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's got some meaning to it.</v>

3431
02:58:13.260 --> 02:58:18.260
<v Speaker 3>Now I think it's going to be beyond our </v>
<v Speaker 3>Ability today to really get into that,</v>

3432
02:58:18.690 --> 02:58:21.690
<v Speaker 3>but this is the kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Would you be to peel back these layers?</v>

3433
02:58:21.691 --> 02:58:24.570
<v Speaker 3>You begin to discover that there are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these ratio is built into this.</v>

3434
02:58:24.600 --> 02:58:26.550
<v Speaker 4>So it's some in a sense</v>

3435
02:58:27.460 --> 02:58:29.020
<v Speaker 3>it's fractal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>

3436
02:58:29.390 --> 02:58:30.270
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

3437
02:58:30.280 --> 02:58:33.230
<v Speaker 3>and the idea here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just like protocol has said that,</v>

3438
02:58:33.960 --> 02:58:37.180
<v Speaker 3>that we humans were the measure of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of all things.</v>

3439
02:58:37.250 --> 02:58:42.250
<v Speaker 3>And in all of these cosmic dimensions </v>
<v Speaker 3>are miniaturized and encoded in our very</v>

3440
02:58:42.911 --> 02:58:43.480
<v Speaker 3>anatomy,</v>

3441
02:58:44.130 --> 02:58:46.590
<v Speaker 4>randall carlson,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we have run out of time,</v>

3442
02:58:46.591 --> 02:58:48.840
<v Speaker 4>but you have blown minds on multiple </v>
<v Speaker 4>front.</v>

3443
02:58:49.020 --> 02:58:50.550
<v Speaker 4>Once again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

3444
02:58:50.880 --> 02:58:55.880
<v Speaker 4>we gotta do another one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When's the next time you tell me a good?</v>

3445
02:58:57.110 --> 02:59:02.110
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>give me a few months to recover from </v>

3446
02:59:02.110 --> 02:59:02.110
<v Speaker 4>this one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

3447
02:59:02.110 --> 02:59:04.290
<v Speaker 4>You tell me.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure it was quite a burst of </v>

3449

<v Speaker 4>information,</v>

<v Speaker 4>What?</v>

3452
02:59:12.130 --> 02:59:13.590

3454
02:59:18.591 --> 02:59:19.230
<v Speaker 4>over this podcast with a fine tooth comb</v>
<v Speaker 4>and try to figure it out.</v>

3455
02:59:19.231 --> 02:59:22.500
<v Speaker 4>I want to say one more quick thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of this information that I've been</v>

3456
02:59:22.501 --> 02:59:27.501
<v Speaker 4>talking about here is on our dvd that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you can get online,</v>

3457
02:59:27.640 --> 02:59:30.780
<v Speaker 4>a cosmic patterns and cycles of </v>
<v Speaker 4>catastrophe.</v>

3458
02:59:31.070 --> 02:59:36.070
<v Speaker 4>Where are you getting all of the images </v>
<v Speaker 4>and a lot of the background and the </v>

3459
02:59:36.070 --> 02:59:36.070
<v Speaker 4>stuff that we went into.</v>

3460
02:59:36.070 --> 02:59:37.530
<v Speaker 4>So if you go to the sacred geometry </v>
<v Speaker 4>international website,</v>

3461
02:59:37.890 --> 02:59:40.190
<v Speaker 4>you'll be able to find a link and find </v>

3462
02:59:40.240 --> 02:59:45.240
<v Speaker 4>What is the exact website sacred </v>
<v Speaker 4>geometry geometry international dotcom,</v>

3463
02:59:45.270 --> 02:59:50.270
<v Speaker 4>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if you just put sacred geometry </v>

3464
02:59:50.270 --> 02:59:52.101
<v Speaker 4>international into search engine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it'll be the first thing that comes up </v>

<v Speaker 4>in your google and your twitter handle </v>
<v Speaker 4>is sacred geometry int correct,</v>

3466
02:59:57.070 --> 02:59:57.680
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
