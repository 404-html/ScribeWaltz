<v Speaker 1>The Joe Rogan experience,</v>

2
00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:03.560
<v Speaker 1>the war on drugs is destroyed.</v>

3
00:00:03.561 --> 00:00:04.341
<v Speaker 1>Our inner cities,</v>

4
00:00:04.341 --> 00:00:06.110
<v Speaker 1>it's corrupted the police forces.</v>

5
00:00:06.111 --> 00:00:06.780
<v Speaker 1>It's screwed up,</v>

6
00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:07.160
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

7
00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

8
00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:08.281
<v Speaker 1>a police,</v>

00:00:08.281 --> 00:00:08.430
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

10
00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:12.290
<v Speaker 1>south of the border and now you have a situation to where your inner city kid</v>

11
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:12.951
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

12
00:00:12.951 --> 00:00:16.670
<v Speaker 1>you've got minimum wage laws and you've got occupational licensing laws that</v>

13
00:00:16.671 --> 00:00:20.420
<v Speaker 1>make it almost impossible for young kid to get a legitimate job yet you've got</v>

14
00:00:20.421 --> 00:00:21.950
<v Speaker 1>the gang bangers flashing around,</v>

15
00:00:21.951 --> 00:00:22.131
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

16
00:00:22.131 --> 00:00:23.000
<v Speaker 1>a lot of cash.</v>

17
00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.540
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

18
00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:24.380
<v Speaker 1>just deal drugs.</v>

19
00:00:24.381 --> 00:00:25.214
<v Speaker 1>You can make a lot of</v>

20
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.830
<v Speaker 2>when you think that minimum wage and the difficulty in getting licensed for</v>

21
00:00:29.831 --> 00:00:32.110
<v Speaker 2>certain positions are what's keeping people down.</v>

22
00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:32.800
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>

23
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:33.521
<v Speaker 2>minimum wages.</v>

24
00:00:33.521 --> 00:00:34.260
<v Speaker 2>Keeping people down.</v>

25
00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:34.840
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

26
00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:35.440
<v Speaker 2>How is that?</v>

27
00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:35.970
<v Speaker 2>How's that?</v>

28
00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:36.151
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

29
00:00:36.151 --> 00:00:36.750
<v Speaker 1>because remember,</v>

30
00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:37.583
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

31
00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:38.581
<v Speaker 1>when you're young,</v>

32
00:00:38.581 --> 00:00:39.510
<v Speaker 1>when you're teenager,</v>

33
00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:39.751
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

34
00:00:39.751 --> 00:00:40.740
<v Speaker 1>You don't have a lot of skills.</v>

35
00:00:40.741 --> 00:00:40.921
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

36
00:00:40.921 --> 00:00:41.370
<v Speaker 1>you really,</v>

37
00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.080
<v Speaker 1>you might've never had been had a job.</v>

38
00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.980
<v Speaker 1>And what's more important in getting a job is not necessarily the paycheck.</v>

39
00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:47.940
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of secondary.</v>

40
00:00:47.941 --> 00:00:50.070
<v Speaker 1>It's what you learn on the job.</v>

41
00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:51.031
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

42
00:00:51.031 --> 00:00:53.010
<v Speaker 1>when I had my first jobs and I was working on me,</v>

43
00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:53.401
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

44
00:00:53.401 --> 00:00:56.850
<v Speaker 1>you're living in talking about outside of high school or in high school,</v>

45
00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.300
<v Speaker 1>the all that's important is the money's the only thing that's important to know</v>

46
00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:01.600
<v Speaker 1>when we,</v>

47
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:01.920
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

48
00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:02.641
<v Speaker 1>when you are,</v>

49
00:01:02.641 --> 00:01:02.851
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

50
00:01:02.851 --> 00:01:03.720
<v Speaker 1>you want the money,</v>

51
00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:03.920
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

52
00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.160
<v Speaker 1>Because you want money for,</v>

53
00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.820
<v Speaker 1>to take a girl out on a date or maybe you need gas money,</v>

54
00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:08.220
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

55
00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.270
<v Speaker 1>But you don't need rent money.</v>

56
00:01:09.271 --> 00:01:10.051
<v Speaker 1>You're living at home,</v>

57
00:01:10.051 --> 00:01:10.980
<v Speaker 1>you don't need food.</v>

58
00:01:10.981 --> 00:01:11.260
<v Speaker 1>Your,</v>

59
00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:12.870
<v Speaker 1>your overhead is taking care of.</v>

60
00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:18.340
<v Speaker 1>The real benefit is acquiring skills on the job training that will enable you to</v>

61
00:01:19.591 --> 00:01:22.470
<v Speaker 1>earn more money as you get older and take on more work</v>

62
00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:23.950
<v Speaker 2>responsibility in these skills.</v>

63
00:01:23.951 --> 00:01:25.780
<v Speaker 2>When you're working at Burger joint.</v>

64
00:01:25.781 --> 00:01:26.390
<v Speaker 2>What am I.</v>

65
00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:27.191
<v Speaker 2>What skills am I getting?</v>

66
00:01:27.191 --> 00:01:28.210
<v Speaker 2>Working at Newport creamer?</v>

67
00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:28.350
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

68
00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:28.590
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

69
00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:29.140
<v Speaker 1>there are a lot.</v>

70
00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.480
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

71
00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.430
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you an example of gas stations because gas stations are good examples.</v>

72
00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.700
<v Speaker 1>I worked at a gas station because at one point in time there were a lot of jobs</v>

73
00:01:35.701 --> 00:01:36.181
<v Speaker 1>for young kids,</v>

74
00:01:36.181 --> 00:01:36.241
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

75
00:01:36.241 --> 00:01:37.920
<v Speaker 1>gas stations and,</v>

76
00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.500
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

77
00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:39.990
<v Speaker 1>and they work mainly for tips.</v>

78
00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:41.250
<v Speaker 1>They would pump gas,</v>

79
00:01:41.251 --> 00:01:42.810
<v Speaker 1>they would check the air in the tires,</v>

80
00:01:42.811 --> 00:01:45.300
<v Speaker 1>they'd wash your windows and they didn't make very much,</v>

81
00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.730
<v Speaker 1>but between Philips and these were the pump jockeys,</v>

82
00:01:47.731 --> 00:01:48.660
<v Speaker 1>right between Phillips,</v>

83
00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.000
<v Speaker 1>maybe they worked with a mechanic and they helped out to mechanics and you know,</v>

84
00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:57.080
<v Speaker 1>a lot of auto mechanics got their start as a pump jockeys and you know,</v>

85
00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:58.350
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

86
00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.831
<v Speaker 1>eventually,</v>

87
00:01:58.831 --> 00:01:59.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

88
00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.770
<v Speaker 1>they were able to become a mechanic and they can earn more money as some of them</v>

89
00:02:01.771 --> 00:02:04.100
<v Speaker 1>may be eventually opened up their own gas station and you know,</v>

90
00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:05.670
<v Speaker 1>became entrepreneurs and had a few,</v>

91
00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:06.870
<v Speaker 1>but they got started,</v>

92
00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.400
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

93
00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:07.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

94
00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.210
<v Speaker 1>at an entry level position.</v>

95
00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.811
<v Speaker 1>Now of course,</v>

96
00:02:09.811 --> 00:02:10.680
<v Speaker 1>the minimum wage law,</v>

97
00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.270
<v Speaker 1>it's all self serve.</v>

98
00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.451
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

99
00:02:12.451 --> 00:02:13.380
<v Speaker 1>you go to a gas station,</v>

100
00:02:13.381 --> 00:02:14.191
<v Speaker 1>there's no human beings there.</v>

101
00:02:14.191 --> 00:02:17.100
<v Speaker 1>Maybe there's one guy that's in a little booth that's kind of overseeing,</v>

102
00:02:17.101 --> 00:02:17.570
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

103
00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:19.050
<v Speaker 1>if you want to check your air in your tire,</v>

104
00:02:19.051 --> 00:02:19.651
<v Speaker 1>you do yourself.</v>

105
00:02:19.651 --> 00:02:20.461
<v Speaker 1>You want to wash your windows,</v>

106
00:02:20.461 --> 00:02:21.300
<v Speaker 1>you wash her own windows.</v>

107
00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.850
<v Speaker 1>All those jobs had been eliminated by the minimum wage.</v>

108
00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.750
<v Speaker 1>But so as the opportunities that came with them and now if you want to get a</v>

109
00:02:27.751 --> 00:02:28.230
<v Speaker 1>mechanical,</v>

110
00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:29.520
<v Speaker 1>you've got to go to vocational school,</v>

111
00:02:29.521 --> 00:02:30.271
<v Speaker 1>you got to pay money,</v>

112
00:02:30.271 --> 00:02:31.230
<v Speaker 1>you got to go into debt,</v>

113
00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

114
00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.300
<v Speaker 1>maybe you can learn to be a mechanic.</v>

115
00:02:33.301 --> 00:02:34.080
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

116
00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.710
<v Speaker 1>on the job training was how young people use to acquire skills.</v>

117
00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.380
<v Speaker 1>And now we've got all those guys going to college.</v>

118
00:02:40.381 --> 00:02:41.730
<v Speaker 1>They get a philosophy degree,</v>

119
00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:42.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

120
00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.140
<v Speaker 1>they spent six years,</v>

121
00:02:43.141 --> 00:02:43.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

122
00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

123
00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.330
<v Speaker 1>barfing at frat parties,</v>

124
00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.010
<v Speaker 1>but they graduate with a huge debt.</v>

125
00:02:47.011 --> 00:02:47.844
<v Speaker 1>They know nothing,</v>

126
00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

127
00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.190
<v Speaker 1>a lot of them would have been better off getting,</v>

128
00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

129
00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:52.800
<v Speaker 1>getting a low paying job and learning how to do something.</v>

130
00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.340
<v Speaker 1>This</v>

131
00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:54.410
<v Speaker 2>time of this,</v>

132
00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.990
<v Speaker 2>when people did learn how to be a mechanic by becoming a pump jockey,</v>

133
00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:59.380
<v Speaker 2>there was a minimum wage in effect.</v>

134
00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:00.130
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

135
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.700
<v Speaker 1>the minimum wage in America didn't start until 1938.</v>

136
00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.640
<v Speaker 1>But I looked at a gas station,</v>

137
00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:07.360
<v Speaker 1>but I had a minimum wage.</v>

138
00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:12.660
<v Speaker 1>It started in 1938 and it only affected some certain federal workers.</v>

139
00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.930
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't.</v>

140
00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.100
<v Speaker 1>And it was 20,</v>

141
00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.371
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

142
00:03:15.371 --> 00:03:17.290
<v Speaker 1>was it five slash twenty five cents an hour.</v>

143
00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.580
<v Speaker 1>It didn't apply to most workers until the mid 19 sixties.</v>

144
00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:25.480
<v Speaker 1>So it was the war on poverty that really brought about the,</v>

145
00:03:25.481 --> 00:03:25.930
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

146
00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:26.650
<v Speaker 1>the minimum wage.</v>

147
00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:27.160
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

148
00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.560
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

149
00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.320
<v Speaker 1>and of course over time,</v>

150
00:03:29.321 --> 00:03:33.010
<v Speaker 1>as the minimum wage got higher and higher during the sixties and seventies,</v>

151
00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.440
<v Speaker 1>that's when it really began to take a bigger toll.</v>

152
00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.710
<v Speaker 1>But at,</v>

153
00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:38.170
<v Speaker 1>like if you look now at like black teenage unemployment,</v>

154
00:03:38.171 --> 00:03:39.130
<v Speaker 1>which is off the charts,</v>

155
00:03:39.131 --> 00:03:39.941
<v Speaker 1>which is what 50,</v>

156
00:03:39.941 --> 00:03:40.331
<v Speaker 1>60,</v>

157
00:03:40.331 --> 00:03:41.770
<v Speaker 1>70 percent of sure example it is.</v>

158
00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.720
<v Speaker 1>But if you go back before the minimum wage,</v>

159
00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.740
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

160
00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:47.080
<v Speaker 1>Black teenage unemployment was made out of 15 percent.</v>

161
00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:49.390
<v Speaker 1>It was actually lower than white teenage unemployment.</v>

162
00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:50.320
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

163
00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:50.700
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

164
00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:51.240
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

165
00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.520
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

166
00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:52.980
<v Speaker 1>and all this stuff you take,</v>

167
00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:57.450
<v Speaker 1>you take the bottom rung off the job ladder and you just obliterate it.</v>

168
00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:00.130
<v Speaker 1>Used to make it impossible for young,</v>

169
00:04:00.131 --> 00:04:02.050
<v Speaker 1>unskilled people to get a job.</v>

170
00:04:02.051 --> 00:04:04.660
<v Speaker 1>And it's not just a minimum wage because that's the beginning,</v>

171
00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:05.200
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

172
00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.000
<v Speaker 1>Because if you employ somebody at the minimum wage,</v>

173
00:04:07.001 --> 00:04:08.740
<v Speaker 1>you still got to pay payroll taxes.</v>

174
00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:10.420
<v Speaker 1>You got to pay unemployment taxes.</v>

175
00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:12.880
<v Speaker 1>You've got other mandated costs,</v>

176
00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.640
<v Speaker 1>legal costs that increased the cost of hiring.</v>

177
00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.670
<v Speaker 1>So maybe even though the minimum wage is seven,</v>

178
00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:18.580
<v Speaker 1>25 an hour,</v>

179
00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:21.940
<v Speaker 1>maybe it cost you 10 bucks to hire the guy an hour even though you only give</v>

180
00:04:21.941 --> 00:04:22.301
<v Speaker 1>them seven,</v>

181
00:04:22.301 --> 00:04:23.710
<v Speaker 1>25 is cost you 10 bucks.</v>

182
00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.970
<v Speaker 1>What if,</v>

183
00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:27.220
<v Speaker 1>what if their productivity is only worth $6?</v>

184
00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:28.001
<v Speaker 1>You can't hire him.</v>

185
00:04:28.001 --> 00:04:28.834
<v Speaker 1>It's impossible.</v>

186
00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:30.520
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to hire him to lose money.</v>

187
00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:31.750
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to train somebody.</v>

188
00:04:31.751 --> 00:04:32.250
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

189
00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:32.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

190
00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:33.400
<v Speaker 1>there are a lot of people,</v>

191
00:04:33.401 --> 00:04:34.300
<v Speaker 1>these success stories,</v>

192
00:04:34.301 --> 00:04:34.451
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

193
00:04:34.451 --> 00:04:36.220
<v Speaker 1>people go from the mail room to the board room,</v>

194
00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:36.581
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

195
00:04:36.581 --> 00:04:39.670
<v Speaker 1>it's harder to start at the bottom because it's hard to get your foot on the</v>

196
00:04:39.671 --> 00:04:40.840
<v Speaker 1>bottom right because,</v>

197
00:04:40.841 --> 00:04:41.031
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

198
00:04:41.031 --> 00:04:45.640
<v Speaker 1>you have to be at a much higher level and it disproportionately impacts poor</v>

199
00:04:45.641 --> 00:04:46.330
<v Speaker 1>kids.</v>

200
00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:47.560
<v Speaker 1>Inner City kids,</v>

201
00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:48.131
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

202
00:04:48.131 --> 00:04:48.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

203
00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:49.010
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

204
00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:53.020
<v Speaker 1>and it favors these minimum wage laws will favor skilled workers over unskilled</v>

205
00:04:53.021 --> 00:04:53.291
<v Speaker 1>workers.</v>

206
00:04:53.291 --> 00:04:54.760
<v Speaker 1>Because if I have to pay a certain wage,</v>

207
00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:57.010
<v Speaker 1>well then maybe I'll hire somebody that has more skill.</v>

208
00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:57.641
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

209
00:04:57.641 --> 00:04:58.780
<v Speaker 1>it was the skilled workers,</v>

210
00:04:58.781 --> 00:05:01.300
<v Speaker 1>the labor unions that lobbied for the minimum wage,</v>

211
00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:03.220
<v Speaker 1>not because it benefited them because they,</v>

212
00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:04.750
<v Speaker 1>they made much more than minimum wage.</v>

213
00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:08.470
<v Speaker 1>What they wanted to do is make it expensive to hire unskilled labor.</v>

214
00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.120
<v Speaker 1>So you wouldn't hire the unskilled labor.</v>

215
00:05:10.121 --> 00:05:11.890
<v Speaker 1>You would just hire the union labor.</v>

216
00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:12.701
<v Speaker 1>I see what you're saying.</v>

217
00:05:12.701 --> 00:05:16.810
<v Speaker 1>So you're saying essentially is that minimum wage is more government intrusion</v>

218
00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:21.520
<v Speaker 1>and the more freedom that you have the government take away from you,</v>

219
00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:23.650
<v Speaker 1>whether it's minimum wage freedom,</v>

220
00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:25.660
<v Speaker 1>whether it's tax free and whatever it is.</v>

221
00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.150
<v Speaker 1>The worst is gonna be you're gonna have more regulations,</v>

222
00:05:28.151 --> 00:05:29.310
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna have more people involved,</v>

223
00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:29.981
<v Speaker 1>more red tape,</v>

224
00:05:29.981 --> 00:05:30.641
<v Speaker 1>more bullshit,</v>

225
00:05:30.641 --> 00:05:31.910
<v Speaker 1>and more waste more.</v>

226
00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:34.360
<v Speaker 1>I should have a right to work,</v>

227
00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:35.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

228
00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:36.260
<v Speaker 1>if you know,</v>

229
00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:37.810
<v Speaker 1>if I want to write it,</v>

230
00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:38.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

231
00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:39.670
<v Speaker 1>if you know the interesting thing,</v>

232
00:05:39.671 --> 00:05:41.350
<v Speaker 1>look at all these lawsuits now.</v>

233
00:05:41.351 --> 00:05:43.540
<v Speaker 1>The internships in the entertainment industry,</v>

234
00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:43.811
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

235
00:05:43.811 --> 00:05:45.190
<v Speaker 1>this has the perverse effect of it.</v>

236
00:05:45.191 --> 00:05:49.180
<v Speaker 1>So the government made it illegal to pay somebody below the minimum wage,</v>

237
00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:50.980
<v Speaker 1>but it was okay if they worked for free.</v>

238
00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:51.580
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

239
00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:54.670
<v Speaker 1>So now you have all these interns who probably would have been paid something if</v>

240
00:05:54.671 --> 00:05:55.720
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't for the minimum wage,</v>

241
00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:57.710
<v Speaker 1>but since it was illegal to pay them something,</v>

242
00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:59.120
<v Speaker 1>they ended up working for nothing.</v>

243
00:05:59.480 --> 00:05:59.871
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

244
00:05:59.871 --> 00:06:01.910
<v Speaker 1>now they're suing and they're winning lawsuits say,</v>

245
00:06:01.911 --> 00:06:02.290
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

246
00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:03.260
<v Speaker 1>you have to pay me.</v>

247
00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:06.290
<v Speaker 1>So now they're going to destroy the internships and now a lot of these companies</v>

248
00:06:06.291 --> 00:06:08.900
<v Speaker 1>that used to have internships aren't going to have them anymore about the</v>

249
00:06:08.901 --> 00:06:10.120
<v Speaker 1>interns get college credit.</v>

250
00:06:10.121 --> 00:06:11.510
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't that the whole idea behind it.</v>

251
00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:12.533
<v Speaker 1>Some of them do,</v>

252
00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:12.981
<v Speaker 1>but then.</v>

253
00:06:12.981 --> 00:06:16.040
<v Speaker 1>But then that was even worse because what would happen sometimes in order to</v>

254
00:06:16.041 --> 00:06:18.580
<v Speaker 1>keep themselves safe because the employers didn't want to know,</v>

255
00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:20.120
<v Speaker 1>run a foul of the employment law.</v>

256
00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:23.450
<v Speaker 1>So they would only give you the internship if you got it through a college.</v>

257
00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:23.810
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

258
00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:26.840
<v Speaker 1>So now what would happen is you'd actually have to pay to be an intern because</v>

259
00:06:26.841 --> 00:06:30.500
<v Speaker 1>you'd go and pay tuition to a college just so you can go and work for free.</v>

260
00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:31.071
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

261
00:06:31.071 --> 00:06:34.310
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't it be better not to pay the tuition and go into debt and just work for</v>

262
00:06:34.311 --> 00:06:36.500
<v Speaker 1>a low wage than to pay to work for no age?</v>

263
00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:36.831
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

264
00:06:36.831 --> 00:06:40.220
<v Speaker 1>this is what happens when you have all these government regulations.</v>

265
00:06:40.221 --> 00:06:43.070
<v Speaker 1>Everybody is worse off and you know,</v>

266
00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:43.551
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

267
00:06:43.551 --> 00:06:44.181
<v Speaker 1>people think,</v>

268
00:06:44.181 --> 00:06:44.301
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

269
00:06:44.301 --> 00:06:46.670
<v Speaker 1>these young people are being exploited.</v>

270
00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:46.850
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

271
00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:47.683
<v Speaker 1>they're not.</v>

272
00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:48.930
<v Speaker 1>It's not exploitation in.</v>

273
00:06:48.931 --> 00:06:52.850
<v Speaker 1>A lot of times it's the best thing that can happen to them is they get a job and</v>

274
00:06:52.851 --> 00:06:53.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

275
00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:53.661
<v Speaker 1>people say,</v>

276
00:06:53.661 --> 00:06:53.841
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

277
00:06:53.841 --> 00:06:54.021
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

278
00:06:54.021 --> 00:06:56.000
<v Speaker 1>you can't raise a family on the minimum wage.</v>

279
00:06:56.001 --> 00:06:56.691
<v Speaker 1>Of course not,</v>

280
00:06:56.691 --> 00:06:57.860
<v Speaker 1>and you shouldn't even try.</v>

281
00:06:58.070 --> 00:06:58.460
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

282
00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:00.680
<v Speaker 1>if all you can do is flip burgers,</v>

283
00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:02.180
<v Speaker 1>why are you starting a family?</v>

284
00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:03.110
<v Speaker 1>I mean you should,</v>

285
00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:03.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

286
00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:03.910
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

287
00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:04.080
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

288
00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:05.960
<v Speaker 1>you got to develop your skills.</v>

289
00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:09.890
<v Speaker 1>You got to be able to earn more money than that before you take on those extra</v>

290
00:07:09.891 --> 00:07:10.730
<v Speaker 1>responsibilities.</v>

291
00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:11.661
<v Speaker 1>But if you say,</v>

292
00:07:11.661 --> 00:07:11.930
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

293
00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:15.410
<v Speaker 1>every wage has to be a wage that could let you know,</v>

294
00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:16.310
<v Speaker 1>support a family,</v>

295
00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:18.110
<v Speaker 1>then there are no entry level jobs.</v>

296
00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:21.320
<v Speaker 1>Well then how do you enter the labor market if there's no entry level position,</v>

297
00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:21.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

298
00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:22.131
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

299
00:07:22.131 --> 00:07:24.140
<v Speaker 1>if you're in a situation like a fast food Gig,</v>

300
00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:24.890
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

301
00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:26.540
<v Speaker 1>where does that lead to the manager?</v>

302
00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:26.811
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

303
00:07:26.811 --> 00:07:26.941
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

304
00:07:26.941 --> 00:07:27.130
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

305
00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:29.520
<v Speaker 1>what are you going to rise through the ranks at a fast food?</v>

306
00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:30.790
<v Speaker 1>Some people write,</v>

307
00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:32.000
<v Speaker 1>some people start out,</v>

308
00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:32.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

309
00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:32.991
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

310
00:07:32.991 --> 00:07:33.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

311
00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:35.030
<v Speaker 1>cooking French fries or mopping up and,</v>

312
00:07:35.031 --> 00:07:37.550
<v Speaker 1>and go onto b if own a franchise.</v>

313
00:07:37.551 --> 00:07:37.731
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

314
00:07:37.731 --> 00:07:40.130
<v Speaker 1>so you can certainly move up and there are people,</v>

315
00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:40.570
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

316
00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:43.550
<v Speaker 1>I think the guy who's about to be the new CEO of Walmart,</v>

317
00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:47.450
<v Speaker 1>his first job was working on a loading dock and what are the distribution</v>

318
00:07:47.451 --> 00:07:47.811
<v Speaker 1>centers?</v>

319
00:07:47.811 --> 00:07:48.520
<v Speaker 1>And now he's the abuse.</v>

320
00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:49.220
<v Speaker 1>The CEO,</v>

321
00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:50.840
<v Speaker 1>he worked his way up to the very top of the call.</v>

322
00:07:50.841 --> 00:07:51.674
<v Speaker 1>He went to college.</v>

323
00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:52.250
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

324
00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:52.610
<v Speaker 1>but I mean,</v>

325
00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:53.000
<v Speaker 1>that's not,</v>

326
00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:53.461
<v Speaker 1>but that's not what,</v>

327
00:07:53.461 --> 00:07:54.730
<v Speaker 1>how he got his foot in the door and I don't,</v>

328
00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:55.141
<v Speaker 1>I probably,</v>

329
00:07:55.141 --> 00:07:55.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

330
00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:55.880
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

331
00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:56.440
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>

332
00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:56.711
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

333
00:07:56.711 --> 00:07:58.850
<v Speaker 1>they wouldn't have hired him to run the company and let's say,</v>

334
00:07:59.410 --> 00:08:00.560
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know,</v>

335
00:08:00.561 --> 00:08:01.130
<v Speaker 1>but maybe,</v>

336
00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:01.490
<v Speaker 1>maybe,</v>

337
00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:02.820
<v Speaker 1>maybe the fact that he worked there,</v>

338
00:08:02.850 --> 00:08:03.790
<v Speaker 1>gave maybe that game,</v>

339
00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:06.110
<v Speaker 1>a legacy assure that definitely had an impact.</v>

340
00:08:06.111 --> 00:08:08.540
<v Speaker 1>But if you take a look at something that works at Mcdonald's,</v>

341
00:08:08.810 --> 00:08:12.230
<v Speaker 1>you don't necessarily have to work up the chain of Mcdonald's.</v>

342
00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:14.090
<v Speaker 1>Mcdonald's could be your first job.</v>

343
00:08:14.091 --> 00:08:14.330
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

344
00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:15.470
<v Speaker 1>what were my first jobs?</v>

345
00:08:15.471 --> 00:08:16.610
<v Speaker 1>I delivered groceries.</v>

346
00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:18.320
<v Speaker 1>I bagged groceries.</v>

347
00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:18.950
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

348
00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:19.311
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

349
00:08:19.311 --> 00:08:19.880
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

350
00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:22.700
<v Speaker 1>I sold a clothing retail in the mall.</v>

351
00:08:22.701 --> 00:08:23.534
<v Speaker 1>I sold shoes.</v>

352
00:08:23.630 --> 00:08:25.190
<v Speaker 1>I sold cable door to door.</v>

353
00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:25.691
<v Speaker 1>They said,</v>

354
00:08:25.691 --> 00:08:25.880
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

355
00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:26.061
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

356
00:08:26.061 --> 00:08:27.030
<v Speaker 1>did I move up in the.</v>

357
00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:27.360
<v Speaker 1>And.</v>

358
00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:27.651
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

359
00:08:27.651 --> 00:08:28.130
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

360
00:08:28.130 --> 00:08:30.370
<v Speaker 1>I ended up getting other jobs where,</v>

361
00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:30.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

362
00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:32.360
<v Speaker 1>the sales skills were important.</v>

363
00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:32.811
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

364
00:08:32.811 --> 00:08:33.644
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

365
00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:34.640
<v Speaker 1>even when I was,</v>

366
00:08:34.970 --> 00:08:38.120
<v Speaker 1>got my first job at a supermarket and a lot of times I was just mopping up the</v>

367
00:08:38.121 --> 00:08:38.810
<v Speaker 1>floors.</v>

368
00:08:38.810 --> 00:08:41.150
<v Speaker 1>I was bagging the groceries that I would deliver the groceries.</v>

369
00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:43.130
<v Speaker 1>But you just learn to show up at time,</v>

370
00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:43.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

371
00:08:43.790 --> 00:08:45.320
<v Speaker 1>and now you have something that you've done.</v>

372
00:08:45.321 --> 00:08:46.160
<v Speaker 1>I mean a lot of it.</v>

373
00:08:46.161 --> 00:08:48.770
<v Speaker 1>So you get a job at Mcdonald's and then you get a job someplace else.</v>

374
00:08:48.771 --> 00:08:49.780
<v Speaker 1>That's better because what,</v>

375
00:08:49.781 --> 00:08:50.930
<v Speaker 1>what did you do before you were here?</v>

376
00:08:50.931 --> 00:08:51.890
<v Speaker 1>While I worked at Mcdonald's.</v>

377
00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:52.820
<v Speaker 1>How long were you there?</v>

378
00:08:52.821 --> 00:08:53.780
<v Speaker 1>I was there for a couple of years.</v>

379
00:08:53.781 --> 00:08:54.021
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

380
00:08:54.021 --> 00:08:54.890
<v Speaker 1>I still have the job.</v>

381
00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:56.880
<v Speaker 1>Oh well that means at least you didn't get fired.</v>

382
00:08:57.030 --> 00:08:57.630
<v Speaker 1>You have the job.</v>

383
00:08:57.630 --> 00:08:58.920
<v Speaker 1>I mean you've got something.</v>

384
00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:00.510
<v Speaker 1>You've got to start somewhere.</v>

385
00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:04.770
<v Speaker 1>Everybody starts somewhere and you can't expect to get paid a lot of money when</v>

386
00:09:04.771 --> 00:09:06.210
<v Speaker 1>you first start out.</v>

387
00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:10.820
<v Speaker 1>You've got to make yourself more valuable because what you are when individuals,</v>

388
00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:12.960
<v Speaker 1>we sell our labor to the highest bidder,</v>

389
00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:13.680
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

390
00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:17.610
<v Speaker 1>And so what you have to do is you've got to figure out how can I increase my</v>

391
00:09:17.611 --> 00:09:21.750
<v Speaker 1>value to a potential employer so that he'll pay me more money but isn't the idea</v>

392
00:09:21.751 --> 00:09:23.850
<v Speaker 1>of minimum wage just to keep it from being gross,</v>

393
00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:25.140
<v Speaker 1>not just make it.</v>

394
00:09:25.141 --> 00:09:27.300
<v Speaker 1>So it is $15 an hour is pretty low.</v>

395
00:09:27.301 --> 00:09:29.490
<v Speaker 1>It's incredibly difficult to make a living.</v>

396
00:09:29.530 --> 00:09:29.650
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

397
00:09:29.650 --> 00:09:29.751
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

398
00:09:29.751 --> 00:09:29.970
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

399
00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:31.440
<v Speaker 1>It's getting $15 an hour.</v>

400
00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:34.690
<v Speaker 1>But I'm going say you don't have to make a living and feed yourself if,</v>

401
00:09:34.691 --> 00:09:35.010
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

402
00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:35.610
<v Speaker 1>if they,</v>

403
00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:39.810
<v Speaker 1>if they enforced a minimum wage of $15 an hour on like Mcdonald's,</v>

404
00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:41.370
<v Speaker 1>there would be no human beings working there.</v>

405
00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:42.270
<v Speaker 1>It would all be automated.</v>

406
00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:43.223
<v Speaker 1>They wouldn't,</v>

407
00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:43.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

408
00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:46.380
<v Speaker 1>there might be one guy there that made sure that the robots didn't,</v>

409
00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:46.700
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

410
00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:46.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

411
00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:47.753
<v Speaker 1>didn't break down.</v>

412
00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:48.481
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

413
00:09:48.481 --> 00:09:50.120
<v Speaker 1>there'd be machines making the hamburgers,</v>

414
00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:51.960
<v Speaker 1>make it a French fries would be like a gas station.</v>

415
00:09:51.961 --> 00:09:52.621
<v Speaker 1>Wouldn't that be good?</v>

416
00:09:52.621 --> 00:09:55.290
<v Speaker 1>Just like we were talking about deregulation and the government forcing them to</v>

417
00:09:55.291 --> 00:09:58.410
<v Speaker 1>get real jobs for the people that work in the fast food,</v>

418
00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:01.460
<v Speaker 1>Burger King and forced them out there.</v>

419
00:10:01.510 --> 00:10:01.690
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

420
00:10:01.690 --> 00:10:02.191
<v Speaker 1>but then they would,</v>

421
00:10:02.191 --> 00:10:05.680
<v Speaker 1>what would they do that and just go on welfare for them to figure out a way to</v>

422
00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:06.720
<v Speaker 1>get a real job.</v>

423
00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:07.051
<v Speaker 1>But no,</v>

424
00:10:07.051 --> 00:10:09.190
<v Speaker 1>but that is their entry to the job market.</v>

425
00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:09.541
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

426
00:10:09.541 --> 00:10:10.440
<v Speaker 1>they have no skills.</v>

427
00:10:10.441 --> 00:10:10.710
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

428
00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:11.101
<v Speaker 1>believe me,</v>

429
00:10:11.101 --> 00:10:12.480
<v Speaker 1>if these people had better skills,</v>

430
00:10:12.481 --> 00:10:13.680
<v Speaker 1>would they be working at Mcdonald's?</v>

431
00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:13.981
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

432
00:10:13.981 --> 00:10:14.910
<v Speaker 1>part of the problem is,</v>

433
00:10:14.911 --> 00:10:15.470
<v Speaker 1>and this isn't,</v>

434
00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:19.650
<v Speaker 1>you know that there are some people that really could be working better jobs,</v>

435
00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:23.610
<v Speaker 1>but they're not because we have this phony economy that is preventing those</v>

436
00:10:23.611 --> 00:10:24.870
<v Speaker 1>better jobs from being created.</v>

437
00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:25.450
<v Speaker 1>That's the.</v>

438
00:10:25.450 --> 00:10:26.191
<v Speaker 1>That's the problem.</v>

439
00:10:26.191 --> 00:10:29.670
<v Speaker 1>There are a lot of people now that are working at Mcdonald's because that's all</v>

440
00:10:29.671 --> 00:10:31.050
<v Speaker 1>they can get and you know,</v>

441
00:10:31.051 --> 00:10:31.884
<v Speaker 1>it's not like you know,</v>

442
00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:33.900
<v Speaker 1>at least they got that to fall back on,</v>

443
00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:36.570
<v Speaker 1>but the problem is why aren't there better jobs?</v>

444
00:10:36.571 --> 00:10:39.840
<v Speaker 1>Why aren't the jobs that would normally be there for you to work up right?</v>

445
00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:41.610
<v Speaker 1>To the jobs that are higher up on the ladder.</v>

446
00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:42.630
<v Speaker 1>Where are those jobs?</v>

447
00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:46.110
<v Speaker 1>Those jobs are being destroyed by the government because we need more savings.</v>

448
00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:47.550
<v Speaker 1>We need more capital investment.</v>

449
00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:51.480
<v Speaker 1>We need higher interest rates for that to happen and the government is so busy</v>

450
00:10:51.481 --> 00:10:55.050
<v Speaker 1>inflating this bubble economy that they're sucking all the air out of the real</v>

451
00:10:55.051 --> 00:10:55.441
<v Speaker 1>economy.</v>

452
00:10:55.441 --> 00:10:59.250
<v Speaker 1>They're diverting resources from main street to Wall Street and they are</v>

453
00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:01.260
<v Speaker 1>preventing these jobs from being created,</v>

454
00:11:01.261 --> 00:11:01.611
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>

455
00:11:01.611 --> 00:11:03.480
<v Speaker 1>are destroying a lot of the jobs that exist.</v>

456
00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:05.460
<v Speaker 1>So how would you fix that if you.</v>

457
00:11:05.461 --> 00:11:07.710
<v Speaker 1>If I'm Obama and I say Peter Schiff,</v>

458
00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:09.470
<v Speaker 1>I heard you on the Joe Rogan experience.</v>

459
00:11:09.471 --> 00:11:11.610
<v Speaker 1>You make a lot of sense soon guys.</v>

460
00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:12.473
<v Speaker 1>I got working me.</v>

461
00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:13.380
<v Speaker 1>Fucking suck.</v>

462
00:11:13.530 --> 00:11:14.390
<v Speaker 1>Come over here man.</v>

463
00:11:14.410 --> 00:11:14.851
<v Speaker 1>Sit down.</v>

464
00:11:14.851 --> 00:11:15.870
<v Speaker 1>Tell me what the fuck to do.</v>

465
00:11:15.871 --> 00:11:16.651
<v Speaker 1>What can I do here?</v>

466
00:11:16.651 --> 00:11:18.690
<v Speaker 1>How do we fix this mess other than resigning,</v>

467
00:11:18.691 --> 00:11:19.524
<v Speaker 1>but I guess if he's,</v>

468
00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:22.590
<v Speaker 1>if he's actually going to listen to it and make friends,</v>

469
00:11:22.591 --> 00:11:25.780
<v Speaker 1>but if he's actually going to listen to me that I don't want him to resign with.</v>

470
00:11:25.890 --> 00:11:27.870
<v Speaker 1>He actually has that kind of epiphany.</v>

471
00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:30.930
<v Speaker 1>Let's pretend well attend Jamie's the president and you've got to convince him.</v>

472
00:11:31.530 --> 00:11:31.771
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

473
00:11:31.771 --> 00:11:32.530
<v Speaker 1>well then you,</v>

474
00:11:32.530 --> 00:11:33.570
<v Speaker 1>she got a.</v>

475
00:11:33.571 --> 00:11:34.740
<v Speaker 1>What would you tell them to do?</v>

476
00:11:34.741 --> 00:11:35.610
<v Speaker 1>What would you tell him to do?</v>

477
00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:39.360
<v Speaker 1>He's got to start repealing rules and regulations and,</v>

478
00:11:39.550 --> 00:11:39.760
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

479
00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:39.970
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

480
00:11:39.970 --> 00:11:44.790
<v Speaker 1>and shrinking government and closing down agencies and departments and laying</v>

481
00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:45.750
<v Speaker 1>off government workers,</v>

482
00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:48.393
<v Speaker 1>government workers.</v>

483
00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:48.770
<v Speaker 1>How do you.</v>

484
00:11:48.770 --> 00:11:49.603
<v Speaker 1>Where do you start?</v>

485
00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:50.820
<v Speaker 1>I'll start at the top.</v>

486
00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:51.121
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

487
00:11:51.121 --> 00:11:53.160
<v Speaker 1>we've got to fire the president.</v>

488
00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:54.940
<v Speaker 1>Do you want to save the company?</v>

489
00:11:55.210 --> 00:11:56.210
<v Speaker 1>You got to go under yourself.</v>

490
00:11:56.590 --> 00:11:58.260
<v Speaker 1>Get rid of all of the economic advisors.</v>

491
00:11:58.261 --> 00:12:00.000
<v Speaker 1>Look at the Department of Energy,</v>

492
00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:01.110
<v Speaker 1>Department of Agriculture,</v>

493
00:12:01.130 --> 00:12:02.470
<v Speaker 1>Department of Education schools.</v>

494
00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:03.413
<v Speaker 1>Every one of them.</v>

495
00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:04.781
<v Speaker 1>Some of them are,</v>

496
00:12:04.781 --> 00:12:05.291
<v Speaker 1>some of them aren't,</v>

497
00:12:05.291 --> 00:12:07.240
<v Speaker 1>but we can't afford them and they're not helping.</v>

498
00:12:07.270 --> 00:12:08.680
<v Speaker 1>They're not making the country richer.</v>

499
00:12:08.681 --> 00:12:09.640
<v Speaker 1>They're making it poor.</v>
