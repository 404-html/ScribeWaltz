1
00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:02.910
<v Speaker 1>Her low freak bitches,</v>

2
00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:03.811
<v Speaker 1>you should step back.</v>

3
00:00:03.811 --> 00:00:07.020
<v Speaker 1>And this is a narrative that gets repeated over and over again in a social</v>

4
00:00:07.021 --> 00:00:08.070
<v Speaker 1>justice warrior culture.</v>

5
00:00:08.071 --> 00:00:12.150
<v Speaker 1>This idea that you should just step back and let these others talk because they</v>

6
00:00:12.151 --> 00:00:12.950
<v Speaker 1>understand as long.</v>

7
00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:13.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

8
00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:15.780
<v Speaker 1>And the others are always other group members.</v>

9
00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:16.440
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

10
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:17.490
<v Speaker 1>And somehow their,</v>

11
00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.230
<v Speaker 1>their discourses to be privileged in reverse because hypothetically they're a</v>

12
00:00:22.231 --> 00:00:23.730
<v Speaker 1>member of an oppressed class.</v>

13
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:24.020
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

14
00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:24.331
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>

15
00:00:24.331 --> 00:00:28.380
<v Speaker 1>And you can multiply the numbers of oppressed classes ad Nauseum,</v>

16
00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:29.970
<v Speaker 1>which is another part of the problem.</v>

17
00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:30.431
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

18
00:00:30.431 --> 00:00:33.960
<v Speaker 1>I like the idea is that in giving them privilege because they have been</v>

19
00:00:33.961 --> 00:00:34.621
<v Speaker 1>marginalized,</v>

20
00:00:34.621 --> 00:00:38.070
<v Speaker 1>you will balance things out and you will somehow another reverse the scale.</v>

21
00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:38.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

22
00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:41.490
<v Speaker 1>And that's another example of the class based guilt idea.</v>

23
00:00:41.491 --> 00:00:41.791
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

24
00:00:41.791 --> 00:00:43.020
<v Speaker 1>it's um,</v>

25
00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:47.700
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't seem to me self evident that I'm to blame for slavery for example.</v>

26
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:47.971
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

27
00:00:47.971 --> 00:00:48.721
<v Speaker 1>being a Canadian,</v>

28
00:00:48.721 --> 00:00:50.760
<v Speaker 1>it's a slightly different situation I suppose,</v>

29
00:00:50.761 --> 00:00:52.290
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>

30
00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.720
<v Speaker 1>the idea that as the member,</v>

31
00:00:54.721 --> 00:00:55.890
<v Speaker 1>as a member of a culture,</v>

32
00:00:55.891 --> 00:00:58.290
<v Speaker 1>that you're somehow responsible for the past,</v>

33
00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:58.860
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

34
00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:00.090
<v Speaker 1>sins of that culture,</v>

35
00:01:00.091 --> 00:01:01.330
<v Speaker 1>let's say it,</v>

36
00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:01.950
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

37
00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:02.701
<v Speaker 1>it's a very,</v>

38
00:01:02.701 --> 00:01:04.740
<v Speaker 1>very anti western ethos.</v>

39
00:01:04.741 --> 00:01:04.861
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

40
00:01:04.861 --> 00:01:08.580
<v Speaker 1>it goes along with this idea of class guilt because your group membership is the</v>

41
00:01:08.581 --> 00:01:09.480
<v Speaker 1>most important thing.</v>

42
00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:10.441
<v Speaker 1>If your group,</v>

43
00:01:10.441 --> 00:01:11.360
<v Speaker 1>at some point in the past,</v>

44
00:01:11.361 --> 00:01:13.080
<v Speaker 1>it's something reprehensible,</v>

45
00:01:13.081 --> 00:01:14.610
<v Speaker 1>which of course every group has done,</v>

46
00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:15.713
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>

47
00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.620
<v Speaker 1>Then you were defacto responsible in the present for that.</v>

48
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.450
<v Speaker 1>How do you think we got to this point where people are repeating these patterns</v>

49
00:01:24.451 --> 00:01:28.380
<v Speaker 1>that were ultimately incredibly unsuccessful and dangerous and deadly in the</v>

50
00:01:28.381 --> 00:01:28.921
<v Speaker 1>past?</v>

51
00:01:28.921 --> 00:01:30.390
<v Speaker 1>Like Marxism for example,</v>

52
00:01:30.391 --> 00:01:35.220
<v Speaker 1>like people proudly proclaim themselves as having Marxist ideology,</v>

53
00:01:35.221 --> 00:01:36.000
<v Speaker 1>one in five,</v>

54
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.330
<v Speaker 1>one in five social scientists claims to be a Marxist kind of thing.</v>

55
00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:40.890
<v Speaker 1>I understand the history.</v>

56
00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.830
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you fill people in on how that went bad?</v>

57
00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.881
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

58
00:01:44.881 --> 00:01:45.900
<v Speaker 1>the estimates vary,</v>

59
00:01:45.901 --> 00:01:49.860
<v Speaker 1>but in the Soviet Union between 1919 to 1959,</v>

60
00:01:49.861 --> 00:01:54.120
<v Speaker 1>somewhere between 30 and 50 million people were killed in internal oppression</v>

61
00:01:54.121 --> 00:01:54.954
<v Speaker 1>alone.</v>

62
00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:55.950
<v Speaker 1>So that's pretty bad.</v>

63
00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:56.750
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

64
00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:57.010
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

65
00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:58.020
<v Speaker 1>and in China,</v>

66
00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:58.790
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

67
00:01:58.790 --> 00:01:59.080
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

68
00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.290
<v Speaker 1>which was operating under exactly the same principles,</v>

69
00:02:01.291 --> 00:02:05.070
<v Speaker 1>it might've been up to a hundred million killed during Mao's time.</v>

70
00:02:05.071 --> 00:02:06.990
<v Speaker 1>And of course my was still revered in China,</v>

71
00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.250
<v Speaker 1>appallingly enough.</v>

72
00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:09.570
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

73
00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:10.530
<v Speaker 1>and Vietnam,</v>

74
00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.790
<v Speaker 1>Vietnam and Cambodia.</v>

75
00:02:11.791 --> 00:02:13.740
<v Speaker 1>And wherever these ideas were implemented,</v>

76
00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.113
<v Speaker 1>Cuba,</v>

77
00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.740
<v Speaker 1>wherever these ideas were implemented,</v>

78
00:02:16.741 --> 00:02:16.940
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

79
00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.870
<v Speaker 1>the result was absolute mayhem,</v>

80
00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:19.920
<v Speaker 1>absolute mayhem.</v>

81
00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.610
<v Speaker 1>And I think what happened is that the Marxist ideas are actually quite</v>

82
00:02:23.611 --> 00:02:27.360
<v Speaker 1>attractive if you're an Intel lectural and if you're,</v>

83
00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.200
<v Speaker 1>I would say if you're tilted towards compassion from a personality perspective,</v>

84
00:02:31.201 --> 00:02:33.510
<v Speaker 1>because they're based on doctrines like from,</v>

85
00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:34.351
<v Speaker 1>from each,</v>

86
00:02:34.351 --> 00:02:38.340
<v Speaker 1>according to his ability to each according to his need and the idea that you</v>

87
00:02:38.341 --> 00:02:42.570
<v Speaker 1>should fulfill people's needs or that society should fulfill people's needs is</v>

88
00:02:42.571 --> 00:02:43.740
<v Speaker 1>on the surface of it.</v>

89
00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:44.880
<v Speaker 1>And attractive idea.</v>

90
00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.481
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

91
00:02:45.481 --> 00:02:48.630
<v Speaker 1>the problem is who gets to define the needs and who gets to define the</v>

92
00:02:48.631 --> 00:02:49.201
<v Speaker 1>abilities.</v>

93
00:02:49.201 --> 00:02:53.370
<v Speaker 1>And that really is a big problem and well,</v>

94
00:02:53.371 --> 00:02:55.980
<v Speaker 1>and then those ideas were put into practice,</v>

95
00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.820
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

96
00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:00.130
<v Speaker 1>first in the Soviet Union and Alexander Solzhenitsyn who wrote the Gulag</v>

97
00:03:00.131 --> 00:03:04.910
<v Speaker 1>archipelago did a very lovely job of detailing in,</v>

98
00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:08.710
<v Speaker 1>in horrifying detail how those initial doctrines were transformed into</v>

99
00:03:08.711 --> 00:03:13.711
<v Speaker 1>legislation and then how those legislation was transformed into endless genocide</v>

100
00:03:13.721 --> 00:03:15.760
<v Speaker 1>essentially and almost destroyed the world.</v>

101
00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:17.080
<v Speaker 1>Let's not forget that,</v>

102
00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:17.950
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

103
00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.640
<v Speaker 1>partly with w partly with the help of Castro who just died.</v>

104
00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:23.013
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

105
00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.760
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

106
00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:24.790
<v Speaker 1>the doctrines when,</v>

107
00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:26.410
<v Speaker 1>when put into practice in,</v>

108
00:03:26.411 --> 00:03:27.010
<v Speaker 1>into,</v>

109
00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:28.390
<v Speaker 1>into actual practice,</v>

110
00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.610
<v Speaker 1>we're were murderous instantaneously now.</v>

111
00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:31.683
<v Speaker 1>But what happened?</v>

112
00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:34.690
<v Speaker 1>They're always apologists for the left in the West,</v>

113
00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:36.130
<v Speaker 1>especially in France,</v>

114
00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:37.750
<v Speaker 1>especially among the French intellectuals,</v>

115
00:03:37.751 --> 00:03:41.690
<v Speaker 1>especially in the late 1960s and then when,</v>

116
00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:44.150
<v Speaker 1>when all of the information about what was happening in,</v>

117
00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.930
<v Speaker 1>in the Soviet Union came flooding forward and that culminated say in 19 boat,</v>

118
00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:50.050
<v Speaker 1>1973 it wouldn't,</v>

119
00:03:50.051 --> 00:03:51.430
<v Speaker 1>Solzhenitsyn's book was published.</v>

120
00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.660
<v Speaker 1>The French intellectuals changed their tune instead of agitating on a part of</v>

121
00:03:55.661 --> 00:03:56.381
<v Speaker 1>the working class,</v>

122
00:03:56.381 --> 00:03:57.214
<v Speaker 1>which was,</v>

123
00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.670
<v Speaker 1>which allied them with a murderous marks is to stay switched and started to talk</v>

124
00:04:01.671 --> 00:04:02.321
<v Speaker 1>about power.</v>

125
00:04:02.321 --> 00:04:04.750
<v Speaker 1>And to talk about group identity,</v>

126
00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.070
<v Speaker 1>it was like a sleight of hand.</v>

127
00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.610
<v Speaker 1>The underlying pathological philosophy remained exactly the same,</v>

128
00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:14.260
<v Speaker 1>but the surface nomenclature changed and that became very attractive.</v>

129
00:04:14.261 --> 00:04:16.570
<v Speaker 1>And at the same time the Soviet Union dissolved.</v>

130
00:04:16.571 --> 00:04:21.040
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the problems I think we have now a perverse problem is that these</v>

131
00:04:21.041 --> 00:04:24.610
<v Speaker 1>Marxist ideas are very attractive to compassionate intellectuals.</v>

132
00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:25.840
<v Speaker 1>And we don't have good,</v>

133
00:04:25.841 --> 00:04:29.380
<v Speaker 1>bad examples like the Soviet Union around that everybody can point to and go,</v>

134
00:04:29.381 --> 00:04:29.621
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

135
00:04:29.621 --> 00:04:29.861
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

136
00:04:29.861 --> 00:04:30.700
<v Speaker 1>well that sounds good.</v>

137
00:04:30.701 --> 00:04:31.534
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

138
00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.840
<v Speaker 1>what about the murderous death camps in the millions of people who are</v>

139
00:04:34.841 --> 00:04:35.430
<v Speaker 1>suffering,</v>

140
00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:36.610
<v Speaker 1>we still have North Korea,</v>

141
00:04:36.611 --> 00:04:37.061
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

142
00:04:37.061 --> 00:04:40.840
<v Speaker 1>people treat North Korea like it's a joke instead of like it's an exemplar of a</v>

143
00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:45.730
<v Speaker 1>pathological system and people have no historical memory like my students.</v>

144
00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:49.750
<v Speaker 1>And that's partly because they're taught so badly in schools is they have no</v>

145
00:04:49.751 --> 00:04:51.430
<v Speaker 1>idea what happened in the Soviet Union.</v>

146
00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:52.960
<v Speaker 1>They have absolutely no idea.</v>

147
00:04:52.961 --> 00:04:55.240
<v Speaker 1>They know a little bit about the Second World War maybe.</v>

148
00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.750
<v Speaker 1>And of course people generally know about the Holocaust,</v>

149
00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:01.720
<v Speaker 1>but they have no idea what happened in the Soviet Union.</v>

150
00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:03.850
<v Speaker 1>So they have no idea where these ideas could lead.</v>

151
00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:08.530
<v Speaker 1>And this and the universities and the high schools are so full of people who are</v>

152
00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:11.590
<v Speaker 1>radically left leaning that they're never taught any,</v>

153
00:05:11.591 --> 00:05:13.540
<v Speaker 1>that students are never taught any proper history.</v>

154
00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:13.751
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

155
00:05:13.751 --> 00:05:15.610
<v Speaker 1>they're taught about the evils of capitalism.</v>

156
00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:17.560
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

157
00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:17.981
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

158
00:05:17.981 --> 00:05:18.790
<v Speaker 1>it's not like,</v>

159
00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:21.670
<v Speaker 1>it's not like any system is perfect,</v>

160
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.580
<v Speaker 1>but there's difference between imperfect and,</v>

161
00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:26.740
<v Speaker 1>and consciously murderous.</v>

162
00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:31.060
<v Speaker 1>I think one of the things he use just said that's very important is that it's</v>

163
00:05:31.061 --> 00:05:33.820
<v Speaker 1>attractive to compassionate intellectuals.</v>

164
00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:38.970
<v Speaker 1>People that without really looking at what the potential for these,</v>

165
00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:39.560
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

166
00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:44.560
<v Speaker 1>these laws and regulations with a negative potential for them is the,</v>

167
00:05:45.011 --> 00:05:45.700
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

168
00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:50.700
<v Speaker 1>the underlying inclination to lean towards that is that you,</v>

169
00:05:51.761 --> 00:05:52.120
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

170
00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:53.670
<v Speaker 1>you care about people and then you,</v>

171
00:05:53.671 --> 00:05:55.960
<v Speaker 1>you want people to be okay.</v>

172
00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:56.281
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

173
00:05:56.281 --> 00:05:58.280
<v Speaker 1>when you're kind of treating them like they're your children.</v>

174
00:05:58.281 --> 00:05:58.820
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

175
00:05:58.820 --> 00:05:59.151
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

176
00:05:59.151 --> 00:06:02.900
<v Speaker 1>and I don't mean that in an entirely sarcastic manner.</v>

177
00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:04.263
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

178
00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:08.660
<v Speaker 1>it's reasonable in some sense to treat other people like people that you love,</v>

179
00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:11.330
<v Speaker 1>although it's not reasonable and in very many other ways,</v>

180
00:06:11.331 --> 00:06:14.120
<v Speaker 1>which is why you don't invite every stranger on the street to come and live with</v>

181
00:06:14.121 --> 00:06:14.954
<v Speaker 1>you in your house.</v>

182
00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:15.561
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

183
00:06:15.561 --> 00:06:18.020
<v Speaker 1>everybody puts up boundaries and you have to do that,</v>

184
00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:19.393
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

185
00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:21.770
<v Speaker 1>and people tend more than,</v>

186
00:06:21.771 --> 00:06:23.240
<v Speaker 1>than we ever expected.</v>

187
00:06:23.241 --> 00:06:25.640
<v Speaker 1>And I've done a lot of research and this in my lab,</v>

188
00:06:25.641 --> 00:06:29.900
<v Speaker 1>but people do tend to vote and think their temperament a lot more than,</v>

189
00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:31.490
<v Speaker 1>than anyone really realizes.</v>

190
00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:32.400
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

191
00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:35.210
<v Speaker 1>and if you're kind and that's your highest virtue,</v>

192
00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:39.470
<v Speaker 1>then you tend to treat people like they're kin because that's what kind means,</v>

193
00:06:39.471 --> 00:06:39.711
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

194
00:06:39.711 --> 00:06:39.920
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

195
00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:41.570
<v Speaker 1>it's an extension of the word kin.</v>

196
00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:43.940
<v Speaker 1>But that doesn't work well in larger groups.</v>

197
00:06:43.941 --> 00:06:45.110
<v Speaker 1>You need other principals.</v>

198
00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:47.430
<v Speaker 1>And so you look at something like the idea of,</v>

199
00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:48.171
<v Speaker 1>of equity,</v>

200
00:06:48.171 --> 00:06:51.650
<v Speaker 1>which is equality of outcome rather than equality of opportunity.</v>

201
00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:52.760
<v Speaker 1>On the surface of it,</v>

202
00:06:52.761 --> 00:06:54.170
<v Speaker 1>it seems perfectly reasonable to say,</v>

203
00:06:54.171 --> 00:06:54.830
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

204
00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:59.150
<v Speaker 1>if every resource isn't distributed absolutely equally to every group,</v>

205
00:06:59.151 --> 00:07:00.740
<v Speaker 1>then the system is unfair.</v>

206
00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:02.450
<v Speaker 1>And on the face of it,</v>

207
00:07:02.451 --> 00:07:04.160
<v Speaker 1>that's a reasonable proposition,</v>

208
00:07:04.161 --> 00:07:06.800
<v Speaker 1>but it falls apart under minimal examination.</v>

209
00:07:06.801 --> 00:07:08.780
<v Speaker 1>So here's something to think about for,</v>

210
00:07:08.781 --> 00:07:09.230
<v Speaker 1>for all,</v>

211
00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:12.230
<v Speaker 1>for everyone who thinks that equality of outcome is a good idea,</v>

212
00:07:12.231 --> 00:07:12.920
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

213
00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:15.350
<v Speaker 1>why the hell are you striving for anything then?</v>

214
00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:21.070
<v Speaker 1>Because the reason anyone's strives to better themselves or to develop a skill</v>

215
00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:26.030
<v Speaker 1>or to move forward in life at all is to produce inequality.</v>

216
00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:31.690
<v Speaker 1>You're trying to rise above the mediocre masses every time you make an effort at</v>

217
00:07:32.001 --> 00:07:32.834
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

218
00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:35.270
<v Speaker 1>And so everything that we associate,</v>

219
00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:36.223
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

220
00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:41.350
<v Speaker 1>positive movement forward to a positive motivation is actually an attempt to</v>

221
00:07:41.391 --> 00:07:43.220
<v Speaker 1>render the world more unequal.</v>

222
00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:44.600
<v Speaker 1>Now you're rendering and,</v>

223
00:07:44.601 --> 00:07:46.460
<v Speaker 1>and we equal in adjust way,</v>

224
00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:47.421
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

225
00:07:47.421 --> 00:07:48.260
<v Speaker 1>Because we might say,</v>

226
00:07:48.261 --> 00:07:48.441
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

227
00:07:48.441 --> 00:07:49.400
<v Speaker 1>if you work really hard,</v>

228
00:07:49.401 --> 00:07:51.080
<v Speaker 1>you deserve an unequal outcome.</v>

229
00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:51.620
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

230
00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:52.160
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

231
00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:54.620
<v Speaker 1>unless you want people to stop working hard.</v>

232
00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:56.870
<v Speaker 1>And that was the old joke in the Soviet Union.</v>

233
00:07:56.871 --> 00:07:57.704
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

234
00:07:58.040 --> 00:07:59.330
<v Speaker 1>they pretend to pay us,</v>

235
00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:01.310
<v Speaker 1>we pretend to work.</v>

236
00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:04.980
<v Speaker 1>So it's so,</v>

237
00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:05.240
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

238
00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:05.570
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

239
00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:07.550
<v Speaker 1>it's so thoughtless that that's,</v>

240
00:08:07.551 --> 00:08:08.450
<v Speaker 1>that's the problem.</v>

241
00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:08.681
<v Speaker 1>Well.</v>

242
00:08:08.681 --> 00:08:12.500
<v Speaker 1>And it's also extremely annoying for people who've worked really hard and and</v>

243
00:08:12.501 --> 00:08:16.760
<v Speaker 1>who've made the requisite sacrifices to become successful along some dimension,</v>

244
00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:19.790
<v Speaker 1>to have that immediately attributed to their oppression.</v>

245
00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:20.870
<v Speaker 1>And it's not,</v>

246
00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:22.940
<v Speaker 1>it's not obvious that that's something we want to do.</v>

247
00:08:22.941 --> 00:08:27.710
<v Speaker 1>It's like for the social justice warrior types out there who might be listening,</v>

248
00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:28.221
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

249
00:08:28.221 --> 00:08:28.551
<v Speaker 1>do you,</v>

250
00:08:28.551 --> 00:08:32.270
<v Speaker 1>are you really willing to say that every single person who's accomplished</v>

251
00:08:32.271 --> 00:08:35.090
<v Speaker 1>something as done that as a consequence of oppression,</v>

252
00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:37.850
<v Speaker 1>that that's again with the Soviets claimed with regards to the,</v>

253
00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:42.860
<v Speaker 1>to the successful peasants in the 19 in the just before the 1920s it's like,</v>

254
00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:45.350
<v Speaker 1>well the peasants were in demand dissipated.</v>

255
00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:48.620
<v Speaker 1>They were serfs until about 30 years before that they were served.</v>

256
00:08:48.621 --> 00:08:52.670
<v Speaker 1>They were basically slaves and some of them had clambered up to the point where</v>

257
00:08:52.671 --> 00:08:56.760
<v Speaker 1>maybe they own their hot and a cow could you don't employ somewhat.</v>

258
00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:58.350
<v Speaker 1>While the Soviet claim was,</v>

259
00:08:58.351 --> 00:08:59.610
<v Speaker 1>well that's all theft.</v>

260
00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:01.530
<v Speaker 1>You've got that all cause you're an oppressor.</v>

261
00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:05.640
<v Speaker 1>And so then the Soviet intellectuals went into the villages and just imagine how</v>

262
00:09:05.641 --> 00:09:06.161
<v Speaker 1>this happened.</v>

263
00:09:06.161 --> 00:09:07.290
<v Speaker 1>So imagine a village,</v>

264
00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:11.940
<v Speaker 1>a small town where everyone knows everybody and there's maybe 10 20 people there</v>

265
00:09:11.941 --> 00:09:13.440
<v Speaker 1>who were moderately successful.</v>

266
00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:14.071
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

267
00:09:14.071 --> 00:09:18.150
<v Speaker 1>And so you can imagine that those 20 people have like a hundred enemies at the</v>

268
00:09:18.151 --> 00:09:20.340
<v Speaker 1>bottom of the socioeconomic distribution,</v>

269
00:09:20.341 --> 00:09:20.970
<v Speaker 1>useless,</v>

270
00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:24.810
<v Speaker 1>horrible people who are jealous and resentful about the fact that these people</v>

271
00:09:24.811 --> 00:09:25.710
<v Speaker 1>have been successful.</v>

272
00:09:25.950 --> 00:09:26.191
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

273
00:09:26.191 --> 00:09:29.250
<v Speaker 1>So now the intellectuals come in and say property is theft,</v>

274
00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:30.750
<v Speaker 1>success is oppression.</v>

275
00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:34.380
<v Speaker 1>And then they looked for the people in the village who are willing to move</v>

276
00:09:34.381 --> 00:09:36.480
<v Speaker 1>against those 20 successful people.</v>

277
00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:36.961
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

278
00:09:36.961 --> 00:09:38.160
<v Speaker 1>those guys at the bottom,</v>

279
00:09:38.161 --> 00:09:39.810
<v Speaker 1>those hundred resentful,</v>

280
00:09:39.811 --> 00:09:40.590
<v Speaker 1>jealous,</v>

281
00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:42.270
<v Speaker 1>murderous people at the bottom,</v>

282
00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:45.420
<v Speaker 1>they're just waiting for an opportunity to go kick down some doors.</v>

283
00:09:45.690 --> 00:09:48.180
<v Speaker 1>And that's exactly what they did in the 1920s and as I said,</v>

284
00:09:48.181 --> 00:09:51.910
<v Speaker 1>they wiped out all their productive peasants and then 6 million Ukrainian starve</v>

285
00:09:51.911 --> 00:09:53.790
<v Speaker 1>to death if they had posters.</v>

286
00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.640
<v Speaker 1>The Soviets produced posters in the 1930s that said,</v>

287
00:09:57.330 --> 00:09:58.163
