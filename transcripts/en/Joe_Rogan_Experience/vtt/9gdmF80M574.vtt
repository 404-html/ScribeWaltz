1
00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:04.740
<v Speaker 1>Her low freak bitches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I trademarked it because I said,</v>

2
00:00:04.741 --> 00:00:06.780
<v Speaker 1>you know what it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was starting to like,</v>

3
00:00:06.781 --> 00:00:07.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>physio when I was like,</v>

4
00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.700
<v Speaker 1>I was really passionate about it because</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's something I was saying again.</v>

5
00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:13.020
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have nobody around me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

6
00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:14.910
<v Speaker 1>Used to have friends with me all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

7
00:00:14.911 --> 00:00:15.631
<v Speaker 1>I'm training,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

8
00:00:15.631 --> 00:00:16.770
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They all left.</v>

9
00:00:16.771 --> 00:00:19.050
<v Speaker 1>They was always moved on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for me,</v>

10
00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:20.190
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no entourage,</v>

11
00:00:20.191 --> 00:00:22.530
<v Speaker 1>nobody to push me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to push myself.</v>

12
00:00:22.531 --> 00:00:25.020
<v Speaker 1>So I started talking to myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that I ever did.</v>

13
00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.870
<v Speaker 1>And that's a whole nother story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanna tell you in the book why I</v>

14
00:00:27.871 --> 00:00:31.670
<v Speaker 1>refuse to talk to myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why does your feet tell me?</v>

15
00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:34.840
<v Speaker 1>I was saving it for book talking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm still really,</v>

16
00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:36.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm selling the book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

17
00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.320
<v Speaker 1>Let me know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Put up links.</v>

18
00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:41.910
<v Speaker 1>If we go in that route,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I already know.</v>

19
00:00:41.911 --> 00:00:42.900
<v Speaker 1>Come on Doug.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But no,</v>

20
00:00:42.901 --> 00:00:44.000
<v Speaker 1>the reason why is because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

21
00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:47.370
<v Speaker 1>I had an uncle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my mother's brother Anthony Par Ham.</v>

22
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.710
<v Speaker 1>He was her only brother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He went to the military,</v>

23
00:00:49.711 --> 00:00:51.660
<v Speaker 1>he went to the Vietnam war as a child.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

24
00:00:51.661 --> 00:00:52.890
<v Speaker 1>he's a young man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>18 years old.</v>

25
00:00:52.891 --> 00:00:55.080
<v Speaker 1>When he left high school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he didn't have to because it was all</v>

26
00:00:55.081 --> 00:00:58.650
<v Speaker 1>sisters and he wanted to because he</v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted to go because everyone in the</v>

27
00:00:58.651 --> 00:00:59.730
<v Speaker 1>rented town,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Petersburg,</v>

28
00:00:59.731 --> 00:01:00.564
<v Speaker 1>Virginia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>excuse me,</v>

29
00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:01.710
<v Speaker 1>Jarret,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Virginia,</v>

30
00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.860
<v Speaker 1>everybody from his town,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the young men will go on its own cousins</v>

31
00:01:04.861 --> 00:01:06.300
<v Speaker 1>and everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he went,</v>

32
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.040
<v Speaker 1>he came back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

33
00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.460
<v Speaker 1>disturbed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He came back different than when he went</v>

34
00:01:11.461 --> 00:01:15.150
<v Speaker 1>in and he was actually missing for quite</v>
<v Speaker 1>a time that they were going to declare</v>

35
00:01:15.151 --> 00:01:17.970
<v Speaker 1>him dead when he showed up one day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

36
00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.220
<v Speaker 1>with a trench coat on army boots and</v>
<v Speaker 1>naked and hosie street in Brooklyn.</v>

37
00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.220
<v Speaker 1>So this led to him being mentally</v>
<v Speaker 1>disturbed all my life.</v>

38
00:01:28.261 --> 00:01:30.120
<v Speaker 1>He would talk to himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He lived with us.</v>

39
00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.040
<v Speaker 1>I slept in a twin bed here and he slept</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the bed there and he was with</v>

40
00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.380
<v Speaker 1>alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He drank,</v>

41
00:01:37.381 --> 00:01:39.360
<v Speaker 1>he became very violent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

42
00:01:39.361 --> 00:01:44.361
<v Speaker 1>he beat my mom up one time really bad</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause I had eyes up and him talking to</v>

43
00:01:44.521 --> 00:01:47.640
<v Speaker 1>himself with something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I grew up all my life watching and I'm</v>

44
00:01:47.641 --> 00:01:48.461
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>amy crazy.</v>

46
00:01:49.741 --> 00:01:51.420
<v Speaker 1>You can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He told me to itself so,</v>

47
00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.290
<v Speaker 1>and I got older,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would just refuse to even have a</v>

48
00:01:55.291 --> 00:01:57.190
<v Speaker 1>conversation with myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh you crazy if you,</v>

49
00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.770
<v Speaker 1>and four years ago I started having</v>
<v Speaker 1>conversations with myself.</v>

50
00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.100
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>let's go champ.</v>

53
00:02:06.211 --> 00:02:07.044
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ma'am,</v>

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:10.550
<v Speaker 1>She was like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

59
00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.020
<v Speaker 1>and it just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that was my mantra.</v>

60
00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.190
<v Speaker 1>It became my mantra.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

61
00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.610
<v Speaker 1>my friend told me one of his mantras was</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be the man,</v>

62
00:02:20.611 --> 00:02:23.430
<v Speaker 1>you've got to be the man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When he was tired,</v>

63
00:02:23.431 --> 00:02:26.400
<v Speaker 1>he was running mile 18 to beat a man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got to beat the man,</v>

64
00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.530
<v Speaker 1>be the man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You gotta beat a man.</v>

65
00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:30.420
<v Speaker 1>I was just saying to himself and I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

66
00:02:30.421 --> 00:02:31.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need a mantra,</v>

67
00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.840
<v Speaker 1>and I was hitting the bag one day and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>was tired.</v>

00:02:33.841 --> 00:02:35.700
<v Speaker 1>I was like 400 pounds.</v>

75
00:02:49.351 --> 00:02:52.350
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it's yours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought she didn't push it through and</v>

76
00:02:52.351 --> 00:02:54.200
<v Speaker 1>set as yours.</v>

<v Speaker 1>The people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The people gave me this,</v>

79
00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.710
<v Speaker 1>the universe gave me this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that people,</v>

80
00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:00.220
<v Speaker 1>the people</v>

81
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.410
<v Speaker 2>linked into it and it's not mine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's ours.</v>

82
00:03:02.411 --> 00:03:05.440
<v Speaker 2>We just want to give each other</v>
<v Speaker 2>positivity and love and I meet people</v>

83
00:03:05.441 --> 00:03:06.121
<v Speaker 2>from everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chan,</v>

84
00:03:06.121 --> 00:03:08.950
<v Speaker 2>I'm a little nuts because I go to every</v>
<v Speaker 2>city or country and people say,</v>

85
00:03:08.951 --> 00:03:10.720
<v Speaker 2>chair,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm in the lobby or I'm in this</v>

86
00:03:10.721 --> 00:03:11.411
<v Speaker 2>town.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Could I meet you?</v>

87
00:03:11.411 --> 00:03:13.060
<v Speaker 2>And I say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come over to the hotel.</v>

88
00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:14.560
<v Speaker 2>And they come.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

89
00:03:14.561 --> 00:03:15.221
<v Speaker 2>They call.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

90
00:03:15.221 --> 00:03:17.930
<v Speaker 2>you might have to stop that when you</v>
<v Speaker 2>went a people.</v>

91
00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:19.700
<v Speaker 2>I'm the people's champ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm free.</v>

92
00:03:19.701 --> 00:03:21.100
<v Speaker 2>I'm here for the people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow,</v>

93
00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.963
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's strong.</v>

94
00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:23.081
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

95
00:03:23.081 --> 00:03:27.100
<v Speaker 2>And when I went to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I interview Senator Mark Pocan last week</v>

96
00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:29.590
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was the one that wrote a letter to</v>

97
00:03:29.591 --> 00:03:31.360
<v Speaker 2>the government.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wants to keep Kratom legal.</v>

98
00:03:31.361 --> 00:03:32.610
<v Speaker 2>He thinks that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

99
00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.600
<v Speaker 2>it should be allowed for everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I said to him,</v>

100
00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:36.580
<v Speaker 2>what do you think about marijuana?</v>

101
00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:38.260
<v Speaker 2>And he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just think it should all be legal.</v>

102
00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:41.950
<v Speaker 2>And it was the first time I was ever in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the presence of somebody that works for</v>

103
00:03:41.951 --> 00:03:45.340
<v Speaker 2>the government saying that they think</v>
<v Speaker 2>that weed and Kratom and all this stuff</v>

104
00:03:45.341 --> 00:03:49.120
<v Speaker 2>should be illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's because he had a good head on</v>

105
00:03:49.121 --> 00:03:52.330
<v Speaker 2>his shoulders about the problems that</v>
<v Speaker 2>people face every day.</v>

106
00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.310
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not black and white.</v>

107
00:03:54.311 --> 00:03:56.230
<v Speaker 2>Like I live in this gray area,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

108
00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:57.250
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm in a lot of pain,</v>

109
00:03:57.251 --> 00:04:00.580
<v Speaker 2>but I don't want to take opiates and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't have to take opiates.</v>

110
00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.860
<v Speaker 2>So where's the pressure coming from to</v>
<v Speaker 2>turn this stuff into a schedule one</v>

111
00:04:05.861 --> 00:04:07.000
<v Speaker 2>drug?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If there's no,</v>

112
00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.300
<v Speaker 2>if there's no negative response by the</v>
<v Speaker 2>body,</v>

113
00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.520
<v Speaker 2>you're not having people die of</v>
<v Speaker 2>overdoses.</v>

114
00:04:12.521 --> 00:04:15.150
<v Speaker 2>Is there an ld 50 rate on this stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

115
00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:16.350
<v Speaker 2>if you look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

116
00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:19.310
<v Speaker 2>I mean you're saying where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where's the ld 50 explained?</v>

117
00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:23.080
<v Speaker 2>We should probably explain to people</v>
<v Speaker 2>lethal dose at 50% meaning if you take</v>

118
00:04:23.081 --> 00:04:25.750
<v Speaker 2>50 rats and you give them a pound of</v>
<v Speaker 2>this shit,</v>

119
00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:29.310
<v Speaker 2>50 of them are 25 and die at a certain</v>
<v Speaker 2>show.</v>

120
00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:30.640
<v Speaker 2>We've heard about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

121
00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:32.350
<v Speaker 2>there's been no deaths from marijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

122
00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:32.990
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

123
00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:34.740
<v Speaker 2>Freedom is the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

124
00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:37.360
<v Speaker 2>no deaths.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There have been zero deaths and there,</v>

125
00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:41.380
<v Speaker 2>there have actually been 15 deaths that</v>
<v Speaker 2>have been brought to the FDA and the dea</v>

126
00:04:41.381 --> 00:04:43.540
<v Speaker 2>is attention.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those 15 that's,</v>

127
00:04:43.541 --> 00:04:44.910
<v Speaker 2>I actually went and interviewed one of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

128
00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:47.770
<v Speaker 2>one of the mothers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the kid was on three psych meds.</v>

129
00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.720
<v Speaker 2>He was withdrawn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was honored with withdrawing from</v>

130
00:04:49.721 --> 00:04:53.110
<v Speaker 2>three different psych meds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a black box warning that says,</v>

131
00:04:53.111 --> 00:04:54.280
<v Speaker 2>warning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're a teenager,</v>

132
00:04:54.281 --> 00:04:56.050
<v Speaker 2>you might commit suicide.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Basically,</v>

133
00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:00.340
<v Speaker 2>and this kid committed suicide.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't die from a Kratom overdose.</v>

134
00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:02.230
<v Speaker 2>He died from committing suicide.</v>

135
00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:05.560
<v Speaker 2>And his mother wants to blame Kratom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She doesn't think that the,</v>

136
00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:08.530
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the psych meds had anything to do with</v>

137
00:05:08.531 --> 00:05:10.000
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I don't want to say that Kratom had</v>

138
00:05:10.001 --> 00:05:11.650
<v Speaker 2>nothing to do with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't really know.</v>

139
00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:14.680
<v Speaker 2>And what I really call for with Kratom</v>
<v Speaker 2>is just more research.</v>

140
00:05:14.681 --> 00:05:18.190
<v Speaker 2>Like I want people to put in the money</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do the research,</v>

141
00:05:18.191 --> 00:05:21.730
<v Speaker 2>to make sure that this is safe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And let's see if we can solve this</v>

142
00:05:21.731 --> 00:05:24.520
<v Speaker 2>opiate epidemic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's see if we can crack down.</v>

143
00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:27.490
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>basically lower the amount of opiate</v>

144
00:05:27.491 --> 00:05:30.460
<v Speaker 2>prescriptions we have in this country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just read an article the other day.</v>

145
00:05:30.461 --> 00:05:34.390
<v Speaker 2>One in seven people in America are going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be affected with addiction problems.</v>

146
00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:36.400
<v Speaker 2>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's crazy.</v>

147
00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:37.680
<v Speaker 2>One in seven.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

148
00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:40.660
<v Speaker 2>That means somebody in your family,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's insane.</v>

149
00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:43.330
<v Speaker 2>Somebody in your family will be be</v>
<v Speaker 2>affected by it.</v>

150
00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:46.450
<v Speaker 2>And that's 10% yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's weird.</v>

151
00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:52.680
