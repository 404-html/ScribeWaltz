00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:02.290
<v Speaker 1>I know that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

2
00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:03.570
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying it's fucking.</v>

3
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.040
<v Speaker 1>I mean they fuck up all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's brutal,</v>

4
00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:11.130
<v Speaker 2>but it's always live on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Always goes to itunes in the unedited </v>

5
00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:11.500
<v Speaker 2>forum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We just have to reboot it.</v>

6
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:12.690
<v Speaker 2>It's back up now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

7
00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:14.290
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so where were you,</v>

8
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:16.760
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>natural disasters,</v>

9
00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.180
<v Speaker 1>natural disasters?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think what we're,</v>

10
00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

11
00:00:19.861 --> 00:00:22.280
<v Speaker 1>it's basically we can see where we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going right at the moment.</v>

12
00:00:22.281 --> 00:00:24.950
<v Speaker 1>There's more and more natural disasters </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming faster and faster.</v>

13
00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:30.220
<v Speaker 1>Some of that may be because of the fact </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we're going through a whole solar </v>

14
00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:32.210
<v Speaker 1>system wide transition as scientists </v>
<v Speaker 1>like Dimitria from Russia talks about in</v>

15
00:00:32.211 --> 00:00:37.211
<v Speaker 1>this guy dieter borrows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of it may be because the level of </v>

16
00:00:37.211 --> 00:00:41.261
<v Speaker 1>human consciousness is more meshed with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the natural state of the planet than we </v>

17
00:00:41.571 --> 00:00:46.571
<v Speaker 1>actually can comprehend quite yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is what most of the indigenous </v>

18
00:00:46.571 --> 00:00:46.571
<v Speaker 1>people believe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I've been visiting,</v>

19
00:00:46.571 --> 00:00:51.051
<v Speaker 1>like we've been doing retreats down in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Columbia to work with the Kogi Indians </v>

20
00:00:51.051 --> 00:00:52.430
<v Speaker 1>and they walk like 25 hours down from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the mountains to hang out with us.</v>

21
00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:54.920
<v Speaker 1>And that's basically the message that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they've been giving us from,</v>

22
00:00:54.921 --> 00:00:59.921
<v Speaker 1>from their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from their older understanding of the </v>

23
00:00:59.921 --> 00:01:01.170
<v Speaker 1>nature of reality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

24
00:01:01.171 --> 00:01:06.171
<v Speaker 1>it's somehow the level of human </v>
<v Speaker 1>spiritual development and how much we </v>

25
00:01:06.171 --> 00:01:09.170
<v Speaker 1>are in a reciprocal relationship to our </v>
<v Speaker 1>local world,</v>

26
00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has an effect on what type of </v>

27
00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.810
<v Speaker 1>catastrophe is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do or don't occur.</v>

28
00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:15.950
<v Speaker 1>That's their perspective.</v>

29
00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.050
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

30
00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.090
<v Speaker 2>when the earth is sick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's because we're sick and we're all </v>

31
00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.991
<v Speaker 2>sick along with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So as tsunamis and hurricanes and </v>

32
00:01:26.991 --> 00:01:31.340
<v Speaker 2>earthquakes and ultimately shifts in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>polar ice caps and shit like that,</v>

33
00:01:31.411 --> 00:01:35.760
<v Speaker 2>and super volcanoes and yellowstone that</v>
<v Speaker 2>are ready to blow and kill half the shit</v>

34
00:01:35.761 --> 00:01:40.761
<v Speaker 2>on the continent that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is all in correspondence with the </v>

35
00:01:40.761 --> 00:01:42.200
<v Speaker 2>sickness of this species of us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

36
00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.180
<v Speaker 2>that's the indigenous perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tam.</v>

37
00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:45.930
<v Speaker 2>That's a scary thought.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But listen,</v>

38
00:01:45.931 --> 00:01:50.931
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we look at the ideas of quantum </v>

39
00:01:50.931 --> 00:01:53.301
<v Speaker 2>physics that even observing something </v>
<v Speaker 2>with certain intentions can actually </v>

40
00:01:53.301 --> 00:01:54.120
<v Speaker 2>change the outcome of particles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

41
00:01:54.121 --> 00:01:56.460
<v Speaker 2>when they do those tests,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those slot tests,</v>

42
00:01:56.461 --> 00:02:01.461
<v Speaker 2>and they show that observing and </v>
<v Speaker 2>experiments actually observing </v>

43
00:02:01.461 --> 00:02:02.570
<v Speaker 2>experience actually has an effect on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>result of the experiment.</v>

44
00:02:02.571 --> 00:02:07.571
<v Speaker 2>Or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or you could say there's no such thing </v>

45
00:02:07.571 --> 00:02:07.760
<v Speaker 2>as just being an impartial observer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're always participating in,</v>

46
00:02:07.761 --> 00:02:09.810
<v Speaker 2>in the outcome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a better way of looking at it.</v>

47
00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.550
<v Speaker 2>It really does make sense that it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

48
00:02:12.551 --> 00:02:15.750
<v Speaker 2>it operates on macro micro and </v>
<v Speaker 2>ultimately,</v>

49
00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this one gigantic level,</v>

50
00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:23.090
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is what like Western alchemists </v>

51
00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.090
<v Speaker 1>talk about when they said as above,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so below</v>

52
00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.270
<v Speaker 2>fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it the idea that human behavior can </v>

53
00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:30.190
<v Speaker 2>actually inspire storms?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

54
00:02:30.191 --> 00:02:32.110
<v Speaker 2>you don't want to say that because you </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't want to say that.</v>

55
00:02:32.111 --> 00:02:34.660
<v Speaker 2>Like the most fucked up places.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The places get the storms,</v>

56
00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.900
<v Speaker 2>but I used to do jokes about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're cruel jokes that I would never </v>

57
00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.721
<v Speaker 2>do now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I just do jokes about how tornadoes </v>

58
00:02:42.721 --> 00:02:42.940
<v Speaker 2>were attracted to the smell of white </v>
<v Speaker 2>trash.</v>

59
00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:46.850
<v Speaker 2>They just circle when you have too much </v>
<v Speaker 2>macaroni and cheese and,</v>

60
00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:51.160
<v Speaker 2>and 40 ounce beer in one location,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's a terrible idea.</v>

61
00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:52.400
<v Speaker 2>There's a terrible joke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

62
00:02:52.401 --> 00:02:57.401
<v Speaker 2>it's really cruel to think that you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>cooler than these fucking poor people </v>

63
00:02:57.401 --> 00:02:58.900
<v Speaker 2>that live in some place where the sky </v>
<v Speaker 2>becomes an angry monster.</v>

64
00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:00.040
<v Speaker 2>But it is kind of</v>

65
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.440
<v Speaker 1>weird that they only landed fucked up </v>
<v Speaker 1>places.</v>

66
00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.040
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to think that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know everyone to blame people for </v>

67
00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.040
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But wow.</v>

68
00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.770
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean obviously we know that's not true</v>

69
00:03:08.771 --> 00:03:13.771
<v Speaker 1>because there's geographic centers in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this country where there's certainly </v>

70
00:03:13.771 --> 00:03:13.771
<v Speaker 1>attracted to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

71
00:03:13.771 --> 00:03:18.540
<v Speaker 1>but the idea that more of them come </v>
<v Speaker 1>because people are more fucked up and </v>

72
00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.140
<v Speaker 1>they're accelerating because our society</v>
<v Speaker 1>is deteriorating.</v>

73
00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:22.900
<v Speaker 1>That's a terrifying thought that we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsible for that.</v>

74
00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:24.680
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>

75
00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.380
<v Speaker 1>or even on a one percent level even </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

76
00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.600
<v Speaker 1>that we're responsible for just having </v>
<v Speaker 1>any influence on it.</v>

77
00:03:31.601 --> 00:03:36.601
<v Speaker 1>Not that we created,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that we even have any barriers as I </v>

78
00:03:36.601 --> 00:03:39.160
<v Speaker 1>discussed in like the 2012 book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the Hopi for instance,</v>

79
00:03:39.161 --> 00:03:44.161
<v Speaker 1>who live in Arizona,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tribes like that may have actually </v>

80
00:03:44.161 --> 00:03:47.041
<v Speaker 1>chosen to live in very difficult </v>
<v Speaker 1>environments where survival is really </v>

81
00:03:47.041 --> 00:03:51.061
<v Speaker 1>like on a knife edge because it forced </v>
<v Speaker 1>them to be able to do things like rain </v>

82
00:03:51.251 --> 00:03:51.910
<v Speaker 1>dances.</v>

83
00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:53.770
<v Speaker 1>So they did it on purpose or do you </v>
<v Speaker 1>think that it.</v>

84
00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:59.960
<v Speaker 1>Is that in or is it that is the result </v>
<v Speaker 1>of them living in this difficult </v>

85
00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:01.750
<v Speaker 1>environment and develop more character?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

86
00:04:01.751 --> 00:04:06.751
<v Speaker 1>it's quite possible because they had a </v>
<v Speaker 1>large choice earlier on of where they </v>

87
00:04:06.751 --> 00:04:08.170
<v Speaker 1>were going to leave and it's possible </v>
<v Speaker 1>they actually chose to leave and live in</v>

88
00:04:08.171 --> 00:04:13.171
<v Speaker 1>very difficult environments because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>forced them to develop their initiatory </v>

89
00:04:13.171 --> 00:04:16.201
<v Speaker 1>and psychic capacity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only reason why I'm questioned that </v>

90
00:04:16.201 --> 00:04:18.371
<v Speaker 1>is because back then the resources were </v>
<v Speaker 1>so scarce and you were on foot </v>

91
00:04:18.371 --> 00:04:19.000
<v Speaker 1>essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if you were on foot,</v>

92
00:04:19.001 --> 00:04:24.001
<v Speaker 1>how much fucking ground can you cover </v>
<v Speaker 1>and how much do you know about other </v>

93
00:04:24.001 --> 00:04:24.001
<v Speaker 1>lands?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

94
00:04:24.001 --> 00:04:26.050
<v Speaker 1>How much do you know about if you move </v>
<v Speaker 1>five hours south doesn't get that cold.</v>

95
00:04:26.051 --> 00:04:27.290
<v Speaker 1>You don't fucking know that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>

96
00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:30.130
<v Speaker 1>I totally disagree with what you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying on both levels.</v>

97
00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:31.540
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that they did.</v>

98
00:04:31.541 --> 00:04:32.320
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean for instance,</v>

99
00:04:32.321 --> 00:04:34.330
<v Speaker 1>we now understand that there was like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sign language.</v>

100
00:04:34.331 --> 00:04:38.920
<v Speaker 1>Even native people who didn't speak the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same language could actually communicate</v>

101
00:04:38.921 --> 00:04:40.460
<v Speaker 1>with very highly developed sign </v>
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>

102
00:04:40.461 --> 00:04:42.700
<v Speaker 1>There was all across the continent and </v>
<v Speaker 1>second of all,</v>

103
00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:47.730
<v Speaker 1>what they've discovered is that a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>native cultures were actually more like </v>

104
00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:50.550
<v Speaker 1>cultures of abundance and cultures of </v>
<v Speaker 1>scarcity that actually the amount of </v>

105
00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:50.940
<v Speaker 1>work that they had to do today though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

106
00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:52.990
<v Speaker 1>compared to what we have to do know an </v>
<v Speaker 1>average day,</v>

107
00:04:52.991 --> 00:04:55.360
<v Speaker 1>it was a lot less than.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that doesn't make match up with your</v>

108
00:04:55.361 --> 00:04:58.720
<v Speaker 1>idea of them moving to a very difficult </v>
<v Speaker 1>environment to stay alive.</v>

109
00:04:58.721 --> 00:05:00.610
<v Speaker 1>Because I'm talking about the hope in </v>
<v Speaker 1>particular,</v>

110
00:05:00.611 --> 00:05:01.380
<v Speaker 1>let's say like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

111
00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:03.570
<v Speaker 1>they were like the Tibetan Buddhists of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the native people,</v>

112
00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:08.900
<v Speaker 1>they chose the most difficult spot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What they state this anywhere as is just</v>

113
00:05:09.521 --> 00:05:11.590
<v Speaker 1>a conclusion or a feeling you have.</v>

114
00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:12.490
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a theory.</v>

115
00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:13.660
<v Speaker 1>It's a theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

116
00:05:13.661 --> 00:05:14.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's ludicrous,</v>

117
00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:15.250
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

118
00:05:15.251 --> 00:05:16.290
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

119
00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:21.300
<v Speaker 1>it was just inside my visited them for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the book and I read a lot about them </v>

120
00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.971
<v Speaker 1>anthropological accounts and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the whole thing is they would put </v>

121
00:05:23.971 --> 00:05:24.130
<v Speaker 1>themselves through these extraordinary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

122
00:05:24.131 --> 00:05:24.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

123
00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:25.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of,</v>

124
00:05:25.721 --> 00:05:26.890
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>efforts,</v>

125
00:05:26.891 --> 00:05:27.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

126
00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:32.410
<v Speaker 1>the Hopi snake clan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would go all around the area that </v>

127
00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:33.700
<v Speaker 1>we collect all of the most poisonous </v>
<v Speaker 1>snakes they could possibly find.</v>

128
00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:35.170
<v Speaker 1>Then the men would sit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

129
00:05:35.171 --> 00:05:37.540
<v Speaker 1>just naked wearing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>going kloss in a circle with their knees</v>

130
00:05:37.541 --> 00:05:42.541
<v Speaker 1>touching.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would open up all of the snakes in </v>

131
00:05:42.541 --> 00:05:45.241
<v Speaker 1>the middle of the circle and the men </v>
<v Speaker 1>would have to sit entirely still until </v>

132
00:05:45.241 --> 00:05:47.110
<v Speaker 1>all of the snakes had crawled past them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

133
00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:51.550
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty fucking wild,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

134
00:05:51.551 --> 00:05:56.551
<v Speaker 1>They definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely had their shit together when </v>

135
00:05:56.551 --> 00:05:56.551
<v Speaker 1>it came to rites of passage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

136
00:05:56.551 --> 00:05:57.980
<v Speaker 1>I remember that movie the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a man called horse.</v>

137
00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:59.500
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember that night incident?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a,</v>

138
00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:00.540
<v Speaker 2>it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

139
00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:02.050
<v Speaker 2>I forget the guy's name,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>

140
00:06:02.051 --> 00:06:05.630
<v Speaker 2>He played the father in a gladiator.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Peter O'toole,</v>

141
00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:07.520
<v Speaker 2>I believe it's Peter O'toole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I might be incorrect.</v>

142
00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:09.680
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>amazing fucking movie.</v>

143
00:06:09.681 --> 00:06:14.681
<v Speaker 2>But one of the scariest parts of it is </v>
<v Speaker 2>one of these rights of passage that he </v>

144
00:06:14.681 --> 00:06:17.831
<v Speaker 2>has in order to become one with their </v>
<v Speaker 2>tribes and American or a be an </v>

145
00:06:17.831 --> 00:06:18.000
<v Speaker 2>Englishman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forget the fucking bills,</v>

146
00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:20.360
<v Speaker 2>but they hung him by his nipples.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

147
00:06:20.361 --> 00:06:22.100
<v Speaker 2>they used to do shit to test you.</v>

148
00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:22.900
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's are the,</v>

149
00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:24.350
<v Speaker 1>the sun dances,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they put the,</v>

150
00:06:24.351 --> 00:06:25.640
<v Speaker 1>they lance you through the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

151
00:06:25.641 --> 00:06:29.600
<v Speaker 1>the pectoral muscles hang you up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>

152
00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:31.490
<v Speaker 1>Is that necessary?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apparently,</v>

153
00:06:31.491 --> 00:06:36.491
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the Indian equivalent of about </v>

154
00:06:36.491 --> 00:06:40.540
<v Speaker 1>teeth straightening I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or botox ingestion or an injection or </v>

155
00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:40.540
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

156
00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:41.540
<v Speaker 1>it's way worse than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are Way better than</v>

157
00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:43.750
<v Speaker 2>rather it's um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

158
00:06:43.751 --> 00:06:48.751
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just having something like having a bar </v>

159
00:06:48.751 --> 00:06:49.210
<v Speaker 2>Mitzvah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>having some sort of a celebration.</v>

160
00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:50.490
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't even have to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

161
00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:53.860
<v Speaker 2>you're hung from a tree by your tits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just has to be something where like,</v>

162
00:06:53.861 --> 00:06:54.550
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

163
00:06:54.551 --> 00:06:55.990
<v Speaker 2>I pass through the door.</v>

164
00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:57.120
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a symbolic.</v>

165
00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:59.850
<v Speaker 1>That's actually what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For me it was like a big distinction for</v>

166
00:06:59.851 --> 00:07:04.851
<v Speaker 1>those cultures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Initiation was actually about going </v>

167
00:07:04.851 --> 00:07:08.391
<v Speaker 1>through some process through which you </v>
<v Speaker 1>would master non ordinary states of </v>

168
00:07:08.391 --> 00:07:09.550
<v Speaker 1>consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You mean on what would cultures,</v>

169
00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:10.880
<v Speaker 1>the native cultures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

170
00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:14.190
<v Speaker 1>initiation was not just a celebration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You actually had to overcome,</v>

171
00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:16.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a life death crisis yet</v>

172
00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:18.610
<v Speaker 2>warrior for them too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

173
00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:20.680
<v Speaker 2>you're in a constant state of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

174
00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:23.360
<v Speaker 2>defending your tribes and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were,</v>

175
00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:28.570
<v Speaker 2>you had to be able to overcome very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very terrifying situations even in </v>

176
00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:29.920
<v Speaker 2>hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

177
00:07:29.921 --> 00:07:31.360
<v Speaker 2>they had a makeup man out of you.</v>

178
00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:32.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

179
00:07:32.471 --> 00:07:37.471
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think that a lot of it was really </v>

180
00:07:37.471 --> 00:07:39.521
<v Speaker 1>more about learning to have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>disciplined approach to non ordinary </v>

181
00:07:39.521 --> 00:07:41.990
<v Speaker 1>states of states of consciousness to </v>
<v Speaker 1>control states of consciousness.</v>

182
00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:44.050
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you mean by non ordinary to mean</v>

183
00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:46.010
<v Speaker 1>like pod enhanced?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you,</v>

184
00:07:46.011 --> 00:07:50.780
<v Speaker 1>I mean obviously pod mushrooms and these</v>
<v Speaker 1>are all native Ios Osca and so on.</v>

185
00:07:50.781 --> 00:07:53.540
<v Speaker 1>But then also things like fasting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

186
00:07:53.541 --> 00:07:54.170
<v Speaker 1>and being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

187
00:07:54.171 --> 00:07:59.171
<v Speaker 1>not eating for five nights where you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>just sitting on a mountain top or </v>

188
00:07:59.171 --> 00:08:02.381
<v Speaker 1>something or what's the benefit of that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's both exactly puts you in exactly </v>

189
00:08:02.381 --> 00:08:05.210
<v Speaker 1>the same kind of state as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychoactive substances.</v>

190
00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:09.040
<v Speaker 1>Five fasting for five days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those will bring on a visionary,</v>

191
00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:10.880
<v Speaker 1>visionary experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

192
00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:11.670
<v Speaker 1>they were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

193
00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:13.550
<v Speaker 1>and force you to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

194
00:08:13.551 --> 00:08:16.260
<v Speaker 1>discipline your mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be able to withstand,</v>

195
00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:22.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ingression this from like the astral </v>

196
00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:22.090
<v Speaker 1>realms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so on,</v>

197
00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:25.650
<v Speaker 2>what do you say to people that say that </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing something along the lines of </v>

198
00:08:25.650 --> 00:08:26.200
<v Speaker 2>fasting where it's actually possibly </v>
<v Speaker 2>dangerous to your body and that's what's</v>

199
00:08:26.201 --> 00:08:31.201
<v Speaker 2>causing you to have these experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really kind of a silly thing to do </v>

200
00:08:31.201 --> 00:08:34.261
<v Speaker 2>in this day and age where you could </v>
<v Speaker 2>choose other paths to the same sort of </v>

201
00:08:34.261 --> 00:08:35.230
<v Speaker 2>results without damaging your body and </v>
<v Speaker 2>shutting things down.</v>

202
00:08:35.231 --> 00:08:38.320
<v Speaker 2>I don't know enough about nutrition to </v>
<v Speaker 2>tell you whether or not it's healthy,</v>

203
00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:41.590
<v Speaker 2>but I've read a lot of people that start</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about fasting for days and days,</v>

204
00:08:41.591 --> 00:08:43.090
<v Speaker 2>days and they say it puts strain on you.</v>

205
00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:45.410
<v Speaker 1>It's not good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

206
00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:46.320
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

207
00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:48.860
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say it's not good for you to </v>
<v Speaker 1>not eat.</v>

208
00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:50.890
<v Speaker 1>It probably isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

209
00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:54.620
<v Speaker 1>I know I didn't know a lot of people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>love it and find it to be very helpful.</v>

210
00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:57.600
<v Speaker 1>That actually one of them in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 1>extending the human lifespan,</v>

211
00:08:57.601 --> 00:08:58.740
<v Speaker 1>they found that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

212
00:08:58.741 --> 00:09:00.390
<v Speaker 1>reducing your caloric intake is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

213
00:09:00.391 --> 00:09:02.160
<v Speaker 1>is the most direct way to do it.</v>

214
00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:03.230
<v Speaker 2>Does that make sense?</v>
<v Speaker 2>To just.</v>

215
00:09:03.250 --> 00:09:06.890
<v Speaker 2>Your body's going at less Rpms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

216
00:09:07.090 --> 00:09:08.110
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a race engines,</v>

217
00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:09.740
<v Speaker 2>not gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not going to last as long.</v>

218
00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:12.250
<v Speaker 3>There's a good episode of Penn and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Teller Bullshit.</v>

219
00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:16.810
<v Speaker 3>Look at the cleansing episode where they</v>
<v Speaker 3>go through like the the diets,</v>

220
00:09:16.811 --> 00:09:20.350
<v Speaker 3>like the lemon detox diets and shit like</v>
<v Speaker 3>that where you don't eat the officer,</v>

221
00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:22.540
<v Speaker 3>go through the colonics and the whole </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing like that.</v>

222
00:09:22.541 --> 00:09:24.610
<v Speaker 3>That the whole thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a crock.</v>

223
00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:27.020
<v Speaker 2>Shantelle is bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Make some excellent points,</v>

224
00:09:27.021 --> 00:09:28.910
<v Speaker 2>but they also make some silly ones </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they.</v>

225
00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.510
<v Speaker 2>They want to find the conclusion that </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything is bullshit.</v>

226
00:09:32.690 --> 00:09:35.630
<v Speaker 2>That's what they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they dismiss yoga.</v>

227
00:09:35.810 --> 00:09:37.610
<v Speaker 2>I watched them dismiss Yoga.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're just talking about.</v>

228
00:09:37.611 --> 00:09:39.560
<v Speaker 2>It's just stretching and stretching and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

229
00:09:39.561 --> 00:09:40.310
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're crazy.</v>

230
00:09:40.311 --> 00:09:43.760
<v Speaker 2>You've never done a yoga class.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you do yoga for two hours and tell me</v>

231
00:09:43.761 --> 00:09:47.600
<v Speaker 2>that's just stretching.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yoga makes you hot.</v>

232
00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:49.340
<v Speaker 2>Yoga makes you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

233
00:09:49.341 --> 00:09:52.790
<v Speaker 2>I've gotten is high from yoga as I have </v>
<v Speaker 2>from a couple of hits of pot.</v>

234
00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.830
<v Speaker 2>No doubt about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No doubt.</v>

235
00:09:54.831 --> 00:09:59.831
<v Speaker 2>Like real strong pot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've gotten to like body tingling </v>

236
00:09:59.831 --> 00:10:03.821
<v Speaker 2>moments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like especially if you take like a real </v>

237
00:10:03.821 --> 00:10:05.771
<v Speaker 2>good class,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like hot yoga where you go real deep </v>

238
00:10:05.771 --> 00:10:08.891
<v Speaker 2>into poses and you really hold them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anybody that dismisses that as just </v>

239
00:10:08.891 --> 00:10:12.971
<v Speaker 2>stretching,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're either not giving me the full </v>

240
00:10:12.971 --> 00:10:16.361
<v Speaker 2>information that you have access to or </v>
<v Speaker 2>you did a really sloppy job of </v>

241
00:10:16.361 --> 00:10:16.361
<v Speaker 2>investigating it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

242
00:10:16.361 --> 00:10:21.270
<v Speaker 2>you can't just say these fucking Indian </v>
<v Speaker 2>masters that had been doing this shit </v>

243
00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:25.331
<v Speaker 2>for thousands of years or just </v>
<v Speaker 2>stretching and that's why they have </v>

244
00:10:25.331 --> 00:10:28.421
<v Speaker 2>these very specific poses that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>believe activate very specific regions </v>

245
00:10:28.851 --> 00:10:31.430
<v Speaker 2>in the hemispheres of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the Chakras of the body.</v>

246
00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:33.560
<v Speaker 2>You can't just dismiss that a</v>

247
00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:34.920
<v Speaker 1>cat if you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

248
00:10:36.310 --> 00:10:41.310
<v Speaker 1>that's what's so a kind of interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>and cool about what's happening right </v>

249
00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:41.800
<v Speaker 1>now and how things are so complex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

250
00:10:41.801 --> 00:10:42.310
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

251
00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:47.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I was looking at a book by this </v>

252
00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:47.790
<v Speaker 1>guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dean Raden,</v>

253
00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:50.760
<v Speaker 1>who studies a psychic phenomena as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientist that incident noetic sciences </v>

254
00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:54.970
<v Speaker 1>and we interviewed for a film or read a </v>
<v Speaker 1>book called the Self Aware Universe and </v>

255
00:10:54.970 --> 00:10:57.640
<v Speaker 1>he analyzes a whole century's worth of </v>
<v Speaker 1>data and psychic experience experience.</v>

256
00:10:57.641 --> 00:11:02.641
<v Speaker 1>Statistically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He even looks at reports from the US </v>

257
00:11:02.641 --> 00:11:04.480
<v Speaker 1>army and the government which support </v>
<v Speaker 1>the existence of psychic phenomena,</v>

258
00:11:04.481 --> 00:11:09.481
<v Speaker 1>of non local communication mind to mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means that consciousness is not </v>

259
00:11:09.481 --> 00:11:11.650
<v Speaker 1>simply brain-based that exist in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>different way now.</v>

260
00:11:11.651 --> 00:11:15.340
<v Speaker 1>But I've also read recently this book by</v>
<v Speaker 1>Richard Wiseman called Para normality,</v>

261
00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:17.530
<v Speaker 1>who believes there was no psychic </v>
<v Speaker 1>phenomena,</v>

262
00:11:17.650 --> 00:11:20.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>busts every evidence for it,</v>

263
00:11:20.410 --> 00:11:20.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

264
00:11:20.981 --> 00:11:23.950
<v Speaker 1>and in his own way is quite convincing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

265
00:11:23.951 --> 00:11:24.400
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

266
00:11:24.401 --> 00:11:25.690
<v Speaker 1>so for me it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

267
00:11:25.691 --> 00:11:30.691
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just makes it a very interesting </v>

268
00:11:30.691 --> 00:11:30.691
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

269
00:11:30.691 --> 00:11:34.320
<v Speaker 1>where you can approach anything and </v>
<v Speaker 1>analytically rip it apart and find the </v>

270
00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:35.390
<v Speaker 1>weak spots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

271
00:11:35.391 --> 00:11:36.370
<v Speaker 1>but maybe what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

272
00:11:36.371 --> 00:11:41.371
<v Speaker 1>what's missing from Penn and teller and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Richard Wiseman's understanding is the </v>

273
00:11:41.371 --> 00:11:45.691
<v Speaker 1>sense that a intention is somehow a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamental aspect of the universe,</v>

274
00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:46.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

275
00:11:46.531 --> 00:11:49.210
<v Speaker 1>so if your intention is to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

276
00:11:49.211 --> 00:11:51.010
<v Speaker 1>take something apart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>desecrated,</v>

277
00:11:51.011 --> 00:11:52.070
<v Speaker 1>ignore it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

278
00:11:52.210 --> 00:11:54.190
<v Speaker 1>and so on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can do of that for sure.</v>

279
00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:55.330
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

280
00:11:55.331 --> 00:11:56.560
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

281
00:11:56.561 --> 00:12:01.561
<v Speaker 2>but within there you've kind of missed a</v>
<v Speaker 2>subtle key that actually makes a life </v>

282
00:12:02.141 --> 00:12:03.760
<v Speaker 2>worth having in a way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

283
00:12:03.761 --> 00:12:08.761
<v Speaker 2>intention is aware and you can be aware </v>
<v Speaker 2>of it in a very tangible form in the art</v>

284
00:12:09.011 --> 00:12:14.011
<v Speaker 2>of standup comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's you cannot be thinking about </v>

285
00:12:14.011 --> 00:12:17.521
<v Speaker 2>something different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Say something else and have the people </v>

286
00:12:17.521 --> 00:12:17.521
<v Speaker 2>react to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They won't.</v>

287
00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:19.600
<v Speaker 2>It won't work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a weird thing.</v>

288
00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:21.910
<v Speaker 2>You could have the joke worded </v>
<v Speaker 2>correctly.</v>

289
00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:25.040
<v Speaker 2>You could say it with the right </v>
<v Speaker 2>intonation you get,</v>

290
00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:28.210
<v Speaker 2>but if your mind is an intuit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can smell it.</v>

291
00:12:28.211 --> 00:12:30.880
<v Speaker 2>It's the weirdest fucking thing in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

292
00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:33.520
<v Speaker 2>The a connection that you have with an </v>
<v Speaker 2>audience.</v>

293
00:12:33.521 --> 00:12:36.510
<v Speaker 2>It could be an audience of 200 or it can</v>
<v Speaker 2>be an audience of a thousand.</v>

294
00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:40.720
<v Speaker 2>If you've reached that full connection,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is like a giant mass hypnosis.</v>

295
00:12:40.721 --> 00:12:45.721
<v Speaker 2>There is some sort of a relationship </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you had with these people and if </v>

296
00:12:45.721 --> 00:12:49.081
<v Speaker 2>somehow or another something hits you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you remember something or something </v>

297
00:12:49.081 --> 00:12:53.580
<v Speaker 2>bothers you or you think about an </v>
<v Speaker 2>argument that you got in with your </v>

298
00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:54.450
<v Speaker 2>girlfriend or a bill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you forgot to pay her.</v>

299
00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:57.400
<v Speaker 2>Any distraction that makes you feel in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>negative way.</v>

300
00:12:57.430 --> 00:12:59.590
<v Speaker 2>Even if you're saying the words the same</v>
<v Speaker 2>night,</v>

301
00:12:59.830 --> 00:13:03.400
<v Speaker 2>the audience will feel it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They will feel it and they will back off</v>

302
00:13:03.401 --> 00:13:04.510
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can feel it.</v>

303
00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:05.960
<v Speaker 2>You could feel them go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not,</v>

304
00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:09.010
<v Speaker 2>he's not engaged.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a religion man.</v>

305
00:13:09.011 --> 00:13:11.320
<v Speaker 2>It's real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't tell me it's not.</v>

306
00:13:11.830 --> 00:13:13.360
<v Speaker 2>I've always said that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

307
00:13:13.361 --> 00:13:15.160
<v Speaker 2>I do my best to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

308
00:13:15.710 --> 00:13:17.680
<v Speaker 2>write standup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I sit down,</v>

309
00:13:17.830 --> 00:13:21.070
<v Speaker 2>I do my best to put in the time to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>there to make the writing happen,</v>

310
00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:26.280
<v Speaker 2>and I do in the time when I perform </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough so that I get onstage that I'm </v>

311
00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:28.210
<v Speaker 2>really comfortable and relaxed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But ultimately at the end of the day,</v>

312
00:13:28.211 --> 00:13:31.210
<v Speaker 2>I'm not exactly sure how that shit is </v>
<v Speaker 2>even coming out.</v>

313
00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:36.480
<v Speaker 2>I don't know where it's coming from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what's happening and when </v>

314
00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:36.880
<v Speaker 2>I'm on stage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I'm completely locked in,</v>

315
00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:40.960
<v Speaker 2>I am as much a passenger as I am the </v>
<v Speaker 2>person who steers it.</v>

316
00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:46.230
<v Speaker 2>And as long as that works,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as long as I'm in that groove and the </v>

317
00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:48.520
<v Speaker 2>audiences in that group,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole thing will go seamlessly.</v>

318
00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:51.820
<v Speaker 2>But one little hiccup,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one little bad thought,</v>

319
00:13:51.821 --> 00:13:55.030
<v Speaker 2>one little error,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one little stress point,</v>

320
00:13:55.090 --> 00:14:00.090
<v Speaker 2>and everybody hops off the the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bride and weights and looks at you </v>

321
00:14:00.090 --> 00:14:04.170
<v Speaker 2>and goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to get this thing going </v>

322
00:14:04.170 --> 00:14:04.170
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Yeah,</v>

323
00:14:04.170 --> 00:14:04.170
<v Speaker 2>get back in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody gets back in,</v>

324
00:14:04.170 --> 00:14:04.330
<v Speaker 2>we're okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're okay.</v>

325
00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:07.450
<v Speaker 2>Do you know what you're doing now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know what I'm doing now they can tell.</v>

326
00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:10.540
<v Speaker 2>And that's a psychic connection.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a legit tangible,</v>

327
00:14:10.541 --> 00:14:12.640
<v Speaker 2>psychic connection that when you're on </v>
<v Speaker 2>stage,</v>

328
00:14:12.641 --> 00:14:17.641
<v Speaker 2>you feel it from the crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You feel like waves of positive and </v>

329
00:14:17.641 --> 00:14:20.521
<v Speaker 2>negative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You literally feel the energy and you </v>

330
00:14:20.521 --> 00:14:20.521
<v Speaker 2>can say that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

331
00:14:20.521 --> 00:14:24.120
<v Speaker 2>You've said you've had really good sets </v>
<v Speaker 2>on stage and you've had jokes that </v>

332
00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:25.600
<v Speaker 2>bombed and you've met people angry at </v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

333
00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:26.590
<v Speaker 2>You felt that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

334
00:14:26.591 --> 00:14:28.210
<v Speaker 2>Don't you feel it like a wave?</v>

335
00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:29.070
<v Speaker 3>It,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

336
00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:30.330
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it affects you.</v>

337
00:14:30.331 --> 00:14:32.580
<v Speaker 3>Just like anything like getting hit by a</v>
<v Speaker 3>snowball.</v>

338
00:14:32.581 --> 00:14:36.210
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if you got a bad joke on state,</v>

339
00:14:36.211 --> 00:14:37.470
<v Speaker 3>if you got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the worst.</v>

340
00:14:37.950 --> 00:14:39.920
<v Speaker 3>If he had a bad joke on stage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>

341
00:14:39.921 --> 00:14:43.530
<v Speaker 3>and it would hit you before you were </v>
<v Speaker 3>like having a great day.</v>

342
00:14:43.810 --> 00:14:46.080
<v Speaker 3>After that you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're having the worst day ever.</v>

343
00:14:46.350 --> 00:14:48.170
<v Speaker 3>You just got hit in the face with </v>
<v Speaker 3>Villanova.</v>

344
00:14:48.210 --> 00:14:50.730
<v Speaker 3>You life is the exact same life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Literally.</v>

345
00:14:50.731 --> 00:14:52.280
<v Speaker 3>None of the hard details</v>

346
00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:54.980
<v Speaker 2>have changed and yet you feel you </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking loser,</v>

347
00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:57.140
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a place called the comedy </v>

356
00:15:24.371 --> 00:15:24.371
<v Speaker 2>connection.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every week they had this guy,</v>

357
00:15:24.371 --> 00:15:27.821
<v Speaker 2>Frank Santos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who would do a hypnotist comedy show </v>

<v Speaker 2>that seemed like bullshit until you saw </v>
<v Speaker 2>it a few times.</v>

359
00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:31.760
<v Speaker 2>And when you saw it a few times you </v>
<v Speaker 2>would realize,</v>

462
00:19:39.031 --> 00:19:39.220
<v Speaker 2>thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a certain ethic,</v>

00:19:39.221 --> 00:19:44.221
<v Speaker 2>a certain way of looking at the world </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I wonder if it is either or or if </v>

464
00:19:44.221 --> 00:19:46.390
<v Speaker 2>it's a combination of things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>

465
00:19:47.110 --> 00:19:47.470

<v Speaker 1>to kill.</v>

468
00:19:57.050 --> 00:20:02.050
<v Speaker 1>The only choice we ever have is to look </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the bright side of the or the crappy </v>

469
00:20:02.050 --> 00:20:05.281
<v Speaker 1>side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So why not just always look at the </v>

470
00:20:05.281 --> 00:20:05.281
<v Speaker 1>bright side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

471
00:20:05.281 --> 00:20:05.281
<v Speaker 1>but you were looking at the end of </v>
<v Speaker 1>civilization.</v>

472
00:20:05.420 --> 00:20:10.420
<v Speaker 1>Just looking at the moment.</v>

479
00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:22.690

481
00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:26.350
<v Speaker 3>That's why.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because there's little kids that made it</v>

482
00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:28.880
<v Speaker 3>as a four year old kids.</v>

<v Speaker 2>kind of get a lot of what people are </v>

487
00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:40.560
<v Speaker 2>really into.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's some.</v>

488
00:20:40.710 --> 00:20:41.680
<v Speaker 2>I was at a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

489
00:20:41.870 --> 00:20:45.720
<v Speaker 2>a guy's house once and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had a picture on the wall and I go,</v>

<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you couldn't make that.</v>

00:20:50.410 --> 00:20:52.120
<v Speaker 2>that's like $30,000</v>

<v Speaker 2>what the fuck are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looked like some painting on some are</v>

495
00:20:56.401 --> 00:21:01.401
<v Speaker 2>ripped pieces of cardboard that were </v>
<v Speaker 2>randomly stuck in a beautiful frame and </v>

496
00:21:01.401 --> 00:21:04.150
<v Speaker 2>I really thought that it was something </v>
<v Speaker 2>that a kid did.</v>

497
00:21:05.050 --> 00:21:05.740
<v Speaker 2>So I don't get that</v>

498
00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:09.620
<v Speaker 3>there needs to be done one that's just </v>
<v Speaker 3>that kind of shit like Gold Buddhists,</v>

499
00:21:09.621 --> 00:21:11.840
<v Speaker 3>but more of a corporate place that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>just super cheap.</v>

500
00:21:11.841 --> 00:21:15.070
<v Speaker 3>Like that could be like $10.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to buy a dragon mass,</v>

<v Speaker 3>food and dog food into one food.</v>

507
00:21:27.190 --> 00:21:30.170

<v Speaker 3>needs.</v>

<v Speaker 3>They can all eat chicken.</v>

<v Speaker 1>suicide and she was sleeping in the </v>

546
00:22:54.290 --> 00:22:58.101
<v Speaker 1>house where he had died and she had a </v>
<v Speaker 1>dream that they were having sex and she </v>

<v Speaker 1>eyes,</v>

550
00:23:07.530 --> 00:23:12.530
<v Speaker 1>it dissipated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no way that could have been a </v>

551
00:23:12.530 --> 00:23:12.530
<v Speaker 1>dream inside of dream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

552
00:23:12.530 --> 00:23:12.530
<v Speaker 1>it could have been anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course it could be,</v>

557
00:23:17.641 --> 00:23:22.641
<v Speaker 1>thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I've collected a whole number of </v>

558
00:23:22.641 --> 00:23:23.270
<v Speaker 1>anecdotes told to me by people and </v>

<v Speaker 1>their,</v>

563
00:23:26.221 --> 00:23:29.910
<v Speaker 1>their efforts to kind of understand it,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

566
00:23:31.701 --> 00:23:33.500
<v Speaker 1>I think that there's no doubt that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

568
00:23:35.341 --> 00:23:40.341
<v Speaker 1>psychic energy collects in physical </v>
<v Speaker 1>environments and when people are no </v>

569
00:23:40.341 --> 00:23:42.390
<v Speaker 1>longer there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they have a stake in that environment</v>

570
00:23:42.391 --> 00:23:45.440
<v Speaker 1>and they are not finished with their </v>
<v Speaker 1>business in the world that they out,</v>

571
00:23:45.470 --> 00:23:47.210

572
00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:52.500
<v Speaker 2>and resentment or something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some sort of a bad energy is enough to </v>

573
00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:52.950
<v Speaker 2>keep a resident</v>

574

00:24:05.290 --> 00:24:10.290
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of his sculptures down in the freight </v>

581
00:24:10.290 --> 00:24:12.071
<v Speaker 1>elevator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Suddenly the light bulb and it just </v>

582
00:24:12.071 --> 00:24:12.440
<v Speaker 1>totally popped and we were in darkness </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

583
00:24:12.441 --> 00:24:13.330
<v Speaker 1>we were all looking at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

584
00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:15.010
<v Speaker 1>nobody had touched it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

585
00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:20.080
<v Speaker 1>somehow that psychic energy that was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was constellated between us and </v>

586
00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:20.370
<v Speaker 1>him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

587
00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:23.630
<v Speaker 1>caused this thing to happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the light bulb I was Joe,</v>

588
00:24:23.631 --> 00:24:28.380
<v Speaker 1>I was in the phone call that you going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to have to make today.</v>

589
00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:33.500
<v Speaker 1>To me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are certain things when you feel </v>

590
00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:33.500
<v Speaker 1>the synchronicity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

591
00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:33.500
<v Speaker 1>it's like a click,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

592
00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:36.380
<v Speaker 1>and it's like you have an intuitive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

593
00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:38.540
<v Speaker 1>acceptance that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

594
00:24:38.541 --> 00:24:42.800
<v Speaker 1>you're being shown a little bit of like </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fabric of space time making a little</v>

595
00:24:42.801 --> 00:24:45.710
<v Speaker 1>bit of a ripple or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in the green room</v>

596
00:24:45.790 --> 00:24:50.790
<v Speaker 2>seriously with like eight people in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>comedy store to started the company </v>

597
00:24:50.790 --> 00:24:54.440
<v Speaker 2>store,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you didn't know for just Fyi was </v>

598
00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:56.911
<v Speaker 2>Ciro's nightclub and it was a bugsy </v>
<v Speaker 2>Siegel's hanging out in Hollywood and a </v>

599
00:24:56.911 --> 00:24:58.960
<v Speaker 2>lot of people allegedly were murdered </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

600
00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:04.320
<v Speaker 2>And every single person who has been </v>
<v Speaker 2>there for more than x amount of years </v>

601
00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:10.320
<v Speaker 2>has some sort of a ghost story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every one of the waitresses has </v>

602
00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:10.720
<v Speaker 2>something managers have something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

603
00:25:10.721 --> 00:25:13.210
<v Speaker 2>how much of it is psychosomatic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much of his suggestion,</v>

604
00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:18.280
<v Speaker 3>how much does the other comics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I was sitting there with like eight </v>

605
00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:19.400
<v Speaker 3>other people were just smoking weed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hanging out,</v>

606
00:25:19.401 --> 00:25:24.401
<v Speaker 3>talking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and suddenly the door sounded like </v>

607
00:25:24.401 --> 00:25:24.710
<v Speaker 3>somebody shot a gun through like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it didn't feel like sound,</v>

608
00:25:24.711 --> 00:25:26.660
<v Speaker 3>like somebody just shook it or kicked </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

609
00:25:26.870 --> 00:25:31.870
<v Speaker 3>It seemed way more powerful than that to</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fact that I think everybody in the </v>

610
00:25:31.870 --> 00:25:32.870
<v Speaker 3>room kinda got down was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck was that?</v>

611
00:25:32.871 --> 00:25:37.871
<v Speaker 3>And we all Kinda got down like on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>couches and on the ground as if we all </v>

612
00:25:37.871 --> 00:25:38.450
<v Speaker 3>thought for sure that was a gunshot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

613
00:25:38.570 --> 00:25:39.960
<v Speaker 2>We'll lose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me stop right there.</v>

614
00:25:40.310 --> 00:25:42.090
<v Speaker 2>And then of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>old ass building.</v>

615
00:25:42.091 --> 00:25:44.490
<v Speaker 2>Here's what's important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a building for the 19 twenties.</v>

616
00:25:44.491 --> 00:25:46.320
<v Speaker 2>That's fucking fault line,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

617
00:25:46.321 --> 00:25:49.580
<v Speaker 2>Those buildings shift and every now and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then they shift and they literally,</v>

618
00:25:50.270 --> 00:25:51.690
<v Speaker 2>and it'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'll make a noise.</v>

619
00:25:51.691 --> 00:25:53.340
<v Speaker 2>I've been in the car when it makes </v>
<v Speaker 2>noise.</v>

620
00:25:53.341 --> 00:25:55.100
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's old married.</v>

621
00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:57.030
<v Speaker 2>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying that it wasn't a ghost.</v>

622
00:25:57.100 --> 00:25:59.820
<v Speaker 2>Now the most likely explanation is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

623
00:25:59.870 --> 00:26:02.240
<v Speaker 3>I thought it was another comic and he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>just like the secret,</v>

624
00:26:02.241 --> 00:26:02.750
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

625
00:26:02.751 --> 00:26:05.510
<v Speaker 3>we take this plunger and then we just </v>
<v Speaker 3>hit it as hard as we can</v>

626
00:26:06.380 --> 00:26:08.050
<v Speaker 2>let comedy secret.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry,</v>

627
00:26:08.051 --> 00:26:13.051
<v Speaker 2>my grandparents lived in a uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>supposedly haunted house and I stayed </v>

628
00:26:13.051 --> 00:26:13.051
<v Speaker 2>there with them in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

629
00:26:13.051 --> 00:26:17.830
<v Speaker 2>in Newark,</v>
<v Speaker 2>New Jersey and it was on north ninth </v>

630
00:26:17.830 --> 00:26:20.251
<v Speaker 2>street and there was a guy who actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>died in the house and he was a guy who </v>

631
00:26:20.251 --> 00:26:21.560
<v Speaker 2>was renting a room there and he died and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

632
00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:26.580
<v Speaker 2>they always thought that this house was </v>
<v Speaker 2>haunted though because the house was </v>

633
00:26:26.580 --> 00:26:30.480
<v Speaker 2>always making noises,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's a fucking house that was built </v>

634
00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:30.480
<v Speaker 2>in like 19.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh nine,</v>

635
00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:34.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an old fucking house and when </v>

636
00:26:34.890 --> 00:26:38.250
<v Speaker 2>you're dealing in a place like New </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jersey that's moist all the time and it </v>

637
00:26:38.250 --> 00:26:40.940
<v Speaker 2>rains all the time and then it gets hot </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the summer and cold in the winter she</v>

638
00:26:41.170 --> 00:26:42.790
<v Speaker 2>would is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

639
00:26:42.791 --> 00:26:45.480
<v Speaker 2>it's an piece of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

640
00:26:45.510 --> 00:26:46.750
<v Speaker 2>construction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It couldn't,</v>

641
00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:51.840
<v Speaker 2>it constricts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it expands depending on the moisture in </v>

642
00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:55.041
<v Speaker 2>the air,</v>
<v Speaker 2>depending on it being cold or hot and </v>

643
00:26:55.041 --> 00:26:55.041
<v Speaker 2>the car,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the old houses like that.</v>

644
00:26:55.041 --> 00:26:56.370
<v Speaker 2>They make a lot of fucking noise in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>creek.</v>

645
00:26:56.670 --> 00:27:01.670
<v Speaker 2>There always were clock and people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>just fucking places or it's an old house</v>

646
00:27:03.031 --> 00:27:08.031
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not completely averse to the </v>

647
00:27:08.031 --> 00:27:11.331
<v Speaker 2>idea of ghosts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of people that talk about </v>

648
00:27:11.331 --> 00:27:11.331
<v Speaker 2>ghosts are full of shit.</v>

649
00:27:11.331 --> 00:27:14.870
<v Speaker 3>Well I just think if there is goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there would be an easy way to prove it </v>

650
00:27:14.870 --> 00:27:17.991
<v Speaker 3>and we've talked about it before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just go to somebody that's like </v>

651
00:27:17.991 --> 00:27:19.680
<v Speaker 3>wifes got died in a rape and you go to </v>
<v Speaker 3>his grave and just or her grave and just</v>

652
00:27:19.681 --> 00:27:22.280
<v Speaker 3>start humping her grave or something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

653
00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:24.570
<v Speaker 3>if there was such thing as that goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>goes would come out and be like,</v>

654
00:27:24.571 --> 00:27:25.250
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck?</v>

655
00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:27.580
<v Speaker 2>They wouldn't want to indulge you and </v>
<v Speaker 2>your nonsense.</v>

656
00:27:27.581 --> 00:27:31.510
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you would hit the wrong if maybe </v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's not something that can easily</v>

657
00:27:31.511 --> 00:27:34.030
<v Speaker 2>be tuned in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's like the northern lights,</v>

658
00:27:34.210 --> 00:27:35.440
<v Speaker 2>like the idea of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

659
00:27:35.441 --> 00:27:40.441
<v Speaker 2>you can't capture the northern lights </v>
<v Speaker 2>and put it in the fucking beam and </v>

660
00:27:40.441 --> 00:27:40.870
<v Speaker 2>blasted on Manhattan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The northern lights are,</v>

661
00:27:40.871 --> 00:27:45.871
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a theory that some sort of a thing </v>

662
00:27:45.871 --> 00:27:46.090
<v Speaker 2>that moves and pulsates in the sky,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

663
00:27:46.091 --> 00:27:48.940
<v Speaker 2>maybe that's what like a ghost is like a</v>
<v Speaker 2>very minor version of that.</v>

664
00:27:48.941 --> 00:27:53.170
<v Speaker 2>Like it doesn't have a rhyme or reason </v>
<v Speaker 2>for when it exists or doesn't exist,</v>

665
00:27:53.171 --> 00:27:58.171
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't have a rhyme and reason.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just we don't understand those laws</v>

666
00:27:58.391 --> 00:28:02.280
<v Speaker 2>yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You say that violates nature.</v>

667
00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:05.470
<v Speaker 2>Just that our understanding of natural </v>
<v Speaker 2>law is limited by our,</v>

668
00:28:05.890 --> 00:28:10.890
<v Speaker 2>by our mental conception,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the type of science that we've </v>

669
00:28:10.890 --> 00:28:10.890
<v Speaker 2>constructed and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you convinced,</v>

670
00:28:10.890 --> 00:28:15.571
<v Speaker 2>I mean what like when you look at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>evidence of ghosts and not go shows,</v>

671
00:28:17.260 --> 00:28:17.710
<v Speaker 2>if you looked at.</v>

672
00:28:18.250 --> 00:28:18.700
<v Speaker 3>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wait,</v>

673
00:28:18.701 --> 00:28:23.701
<v Speaker 3>what evidence are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do we have any solid evidence ever that </v>

674
00:28:23.701 --> 00:28:23.701
<v Speaker 3>there was a ghost or just speculation?</v>

675
00:28:23.701 --> 00:28:26.480
<v Speaker 2>Almost entirely speculation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no scientific evidence.</v>

676
00:28:26.660 --> 00:28:28.340
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't mean that they're not real.</v>

677
00:28:28.341 --> 00:28:29.900
<v Speaker 2>Because if you think about what a ghost </v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

678
00:28:29.901 --> 00:28:34.901
<v Speaker 2>if it goes to something that's not in </v>
<v Speaker 2>this dimension and sort of flits in and </v>

679
00:28:34.901 --> 00:28:35.270
<v Speaker 2>out of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and how do you measure that?</v>

680
00:28:35.620 --> 00:28:38.180
<v Speaker 2>I mean sciences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

681
00:28:38.181 --> 00:28:38.870
<v Speaker 2>everybody says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

682
00:28:38.871 --> 00:28:42.170
<v Speaker 2>science says there are no ghosts or </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no scientific evidence that goes</v>

683
00:28:42.530 --> 00:28:45.920
<v Speaker 2>will science was not really designed to </v>
<v Speaker 2>measure shit like ghosts.</v>

684
00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:49.520
<v Speaker 2>Science is designed to measure like how </v>
<v Speaker 2>much does lead way.</v>

685
00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:53.840
<v Speaker 2>You know what happens when a star goes </v>
<v Speaker 2>supernova observable things.</v>

686
00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:59.080
<v Speaker 2>When you get something like a ghost.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If a ghost was real and it seems </v>

687
00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:02.500
<v Speaker 2>incredibly rare phenomenon that depended</v>
<v Speaker 2>on some really exotic conditions,</v>

688
00:29:03.730 --> 00:29:04.280
<v Speaker 2>how the fuck you.</v>

689
00:29:04.370 --> 00:29:07.430
<v Speaker 3>I can imagine that I'm giving the offer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If there's any ghosts listening,</v>

690
00:29:07.431 --> 00:29:12.020
<v Speaker 3>they can fucking raped me tonight and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they could just rate my ass all day long</v>

691
00:29:12.021 --> 00:29:14.810
<v Speaker 3>with sticks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if it happens,</v>

692
00:29:14.811 --> 00:29:16.130
<v Speaker 3>I'll let you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got news for you.</v>

693
00:29:16.190 --> 00:29:18.830
<v Speaker 3>If they're going to come here from </v>
<v Speaker 3>another guy can do better than me.</v>

694
00:29:18.831 --> 00:29:20.370
<v Speaker 3>I mean for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is like um,</v>

695
00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:23.520
<v Speaker 2>decent and interesting evidence around a</v>
<v Speaker 2>reincarnation really.</v>

696
00:29:23.521 --> 00:29:25.800
<v Speaker 2>There was a book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a person's name in Stevens,</v>

697
00:29:25.801 --> 00:29:28.290
<v Speaker 2>was a professor at University of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Virginia to like 2,500</v>

698
00:29:28.291 --> 00:29:32.610
<v Speaker 2>page book called neurobiology and </v>
<v Speaker 2>reincarnation intersect and he found all</v>

699
00:29:32.611 --> 00:29:37.611
<v Speaker 2>around the world there were children who</v>
<v Speaker 2>had spontaneous recall of past lives and</v>

700
00:29:38.851 --> 00:29:41.070
<v Speaker 2>often very specific like an India.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'd be like,</v>

701
00:29:41.410 --> 00:29:41.790
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

702
00:29:41.830 --> 00:29:42.000
<v Speaker 2>I</v>

703
00:29:42.010 --> 00:29:43.300
<v Speaker 1>lived in this town.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

704
00:29:43.570 --> 00:29:45.610
<v Speaker 1>my wife had this name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had two kids.</v>

705
00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:50.940
<v Speaker 1>So in a number of cases he found these </v>
<v Speaker 1>kids and he went back to the towns and </v>

706
00:29:50.940 --> 00:29:54.260
<v Speaker 1>they talked about and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they found this family and establish</v>

707
00:29:54.261 --> 00:29:56.540
<v Speaker 1>that there had been this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this connection and,</v>

708
00:29:56.541 --> 00:29:59.050
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sense of familiarity.</v>

709
00:29:59.080 --> 00:29:59.860
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no genetic,</v>

710
00:29:59.940 --> 00:30:01.480
<v Speaker 1>no genetic line,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no genetic link.</v>

711
00:30:01.690 --> 00:30:05.340
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes the kids would even have </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a pronounced birthmark,</v>

712
00:30:05.350 --> 00:30:07.120
<v Speaker 1>like a birthmark on the neck or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

713
00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:12.360
<v Speaker 1>And it turned out that the previous </v>
<v Speaker 1>incarnation perhaps had died of a wound </v>

714
00:30:12.881 --> 00:30:14.500
<v Speaker 1>to the neck and a fight or something </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

715
00:30:14.820 --> 00:30:18.330
<v Speaker 2>Is it possible that the connection is an</v>
<v Speaker 2>abstract one that you know,</v>

716
00:30:18.331 --> 00:30:18.810
<v Speaker 2>that they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

717
00:30:18.820 --> 00:30:21.630
<v Speaker 2>they haven't met it yet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that yet there's not a,</v>

718
00:30:21.660 --> 00:30:26.660
<v Speaker 2>a balanced value to learn to experiences</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are transferred through genetics,</v>

719
00:30:27.001 --> 00:30:32.001
<v Speaker 2>like instincts and that perhaps some </v>
<v Speaker 2>instincts that we have a really like </v>

720
00:30:32.001 --> 00:30:33.020
<v Speaker 2>things go wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You learn from them.</v>

721
00:30:33.030 --> 00:30:35.130
<v Speaker 2>That's why you're afraid of cats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mean kids are afraid of them.</v>

722
00:30:36.170 --> 00:30:38.390
<v Speaker 1>Seven year old kid and suddenly out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>nowhere saying,</v>

723
00:30:38.391 --> 00:30:40.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a wife and Agora,</v>

724
00:30:40.610 --> 00:30:41.420
<v Speaker 1>I have two kids</v>

725
00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:42.340
<v Speaker 2>to see them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

726
00:30:42.380 --> 00:30:44.660
<v Speaker 2>this is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But this is my point isn't impossible.</v>

727
00:30:44.780 --> 00:30:49.780
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't it possible that somehow or </v>

728
00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:50.000
<v Speaker 2>another that there is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a memory that through whatever,</v>

729
00:30:50.001 --> 00:30:55.001
<v Speaker 2>a mutation or whatever extreme condition</v>
<v Speaker 2>or weird circumstance as far as like </v>

730
00:30:55.001 --> 00:30:59.771
<v Speaker 2>physical biology becomes a more potent </v>
<v Speaker 2>one and that this as it is transferred </v>

731
00:30:59.931 --> 00:31:04.370
<v Speaker 2>through through generations awakens this</v>
<v Speaker 2>memory awakens this,</v>

732
00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:09.520
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this experience that someone who shared </v>

733
00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:12.431
<v Speaker 2>these genetics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh so many generations ago actually did </v>

734
00:31:12.431 --> 00:31:12.431
<v Speaker 2>have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then all of a sudden,</v>

735
00:31:12.431 --> 00:31:12.580
<v Speaker 2>for whatever strange,</v>

736
00:31:12.940 --> 00:31:14.140
<v Speaker 1>if there's any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

737
00:31:14.860 --> 00:31:16.150
<v Speaker 1>idea that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

738
00:31:16.151 --> 00:31:17.060
<v Speaker 1>genetic material,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it could have,</v>

739
00:31:17.070 --> 00:31:18.220
<v Speaker 1>could have hold memory like that.</v>

740
00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:19.320
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what about memes?</v>

741
00:31:19.321 --> 00:31:21.390
<v Speaker 2>What are the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what about the idea that even racism can</v>

742
00:31:21.391 --> 00:31:22.710
<v Speaker 2>be transferred genetically?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

743
00:31:22.711 --> 00:31:25.530
<v Speaker 2>that's a really kind of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a widely considered idea.</v>

744
00:31:25.590 --> 00:31:28.470
<v Speaker 2>Almost unprovable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I considered by mainstream science.</v>

745
00:31:28.490 --> 00:31:30.060
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of those,</v>

746
00:31:30.061 --> 00:31:31.630
<v Speaker 1>those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those ideas about all these things being</v>

747
00:31:31.631 --> 00:31:36.631
<v Speaker 1>inherited by the genetics being this </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of master molecule are actually </v>

748
00:31:36.631 --> 00:31:38.690
<v Speaker 1>being kind of challenged right now by </v>
<v Speaker 1>the emerging biology of epigenetics,</v>

749
00:31:38.930 --> 00:31:41.540
<v Speaker 1>which is recognizing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

750
00:31:41.541 --> 00:31:46.541
<v Speaker 1>awareness actually begins at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>boundary of the cell where chemical </v>

751
00:31:46.541 --> 00:31:48.230
<v Speaker 1>signals are exchanged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a kind of cognitive process that</v>

752
00:31:48.231 --> 00:31:53.231
<v Speaker 1>happens even at the permeable boundary </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the cell as some signals are allowed </v>

753
00:31:53.231 --> 00:31:57.161
<v Speaker 1>in and some are ignored or rejected and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what's allowed in actually then </v>

754
00:31:57.161 --> 00:32:01.991
<v Speaker 1>influences how the genetic material </v>
<v Speaker 1>expresses itself and reproduces itself.</v>

755
00:32:03.300 --> 00:32:06.620
<v Speaker 1>That actually it's not so much the </v>
<v Speaker 1>genetic material is the master molecule.</v>

756
00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:10.130
<v Speaker 1>It's more as if the whole cell is a unit</v>
<v Speaker 1>of cognition or awareness.</v>

757
00:32:10.430 --> 00:32:12.710
<v Speaker 1>This is very much thinking of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a Varella,</v>

758
00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:16.130
<v Speaker 2>but is this a theory or they have done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

759
00:32:16.170 --> 00:32:16.980
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they haven't done it,</v>

760
00:32:16.981 --> 00:32:18.090
<v Speaker 2>but everything was counting.</v>

761
00:32:18.660 --> 00:32:18.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

762
00:32:18.931 --> 00:32:21.700
<v Speaker 1>this is a look at the biologist Bruce </v>
<v Speaker 1>Lipton.</v>

763
00:32:21.701 --> 00:32:23.910
<v Speaker 1>He has a book called a biology beyond </v>
<v Speaker 1>belief.</v>

764
00:32:24.150 --> 00:32:25.470
<v Speaker 1>Really looking at how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

765
00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:30.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness and awareness began even </v>

766
00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:33.591
<v Speaker 1>at a cellular level and how that in </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself influences and inflects how the </v>

767
00:32:33.591 --> 00:32:36.720
<v Speaker 1>genetic material expresses itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That the genes are not master molecules.</v>

768
00:32:38.380 --> 00:32:40.220
<v Speaker 1>The whole idea it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so fascinating.</v>

769
00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:41.450
<v Speaker 2>The idea of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

770
00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:44.880
<v Speaker 2>I mean w w what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what instincts when we're,</v>

771
00:32:44.881 --> 00:32:46.220
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do we instincts come from.</v>

772
00:32:46.221 --> 00:32:48.320
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it all from one initial source,</v>

773
00:32:48.321 --> 00:32:49.970
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stay away from fire.</v>

774
00:32:49.971 --> 00:32:51.650
<v Speaker 2>You get scared when you see snakes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

775
00:32:51.651 --> 00:32:55.070
<v Speaker 2>these are all learned impressions and in</v>
<v Speaker 2>our,</v>

776
00:32:55.090 --> 00:32:57.410
<v Speaker 2>our material,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the material that makes human beings are</v>

777
00:32:57.411 --> 00:33:00.920
<v Speaker 2>certain things that you show people and </v>
<v Speaker 2>children when they're really young,</v>

778
00:33:00.921 --> 00:33:04.440
<v Speaker 2>have certain fears and notions of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bogeyman and the,</v>

779
00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:04.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

780
00:33:04.921 --> 00:33:07.520
<v Speaker 2>the monster that lives in the woods and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the things in the dark and,</v>

781
00:33:07.790 --> 00:33:12.790
<v Speaker 2>and a lot of these are imprinted from </v>
<v Speaker 2>being killed by Jaguars from some </v>

782
00:33:12.790 --> 00:33:17.280
<v Speaker 2>protocol hominid that lived 5,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>or 5 million years ago there got killed </v>

783
00:33:17.280 --> 00:33:17.780
<v Speaker 2>by Jaguars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And those,</v>

784
00:33:17.990 --> 00:33:22.250
<v Speaker 2>those instincts are still tingling in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the background noise of our mind.</v>

785
00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:24.370
<v Speaker 1>That's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that could also be explained.</v>

786
00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:27.590
<v Speaker 1>You ever get into like rupert sheldrake </v>
<v Speaker 1>his ideas around the morphogenic field,</v>

787
00:33:28.150 --> 00:33:31.190
<v Speaker 1>but knowing when their parents coming </v>
<v Speaker 1>home,</v>

788
00:33:31.220 --> 00:33:36.220
<v Speaker 1>so maybe there was this species </v>
<v Speaker 1>encounter that was like a near death </v>

789
00:33:36.220 --> 00:33:37.810
<v Speaker 1>encounter for humanity and it left this </v>
<v Speaker 1>morphogenic field of,</v>

790
00:33:37.811 --> 00:33:40.610
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of fear and terror around the snake,</v>

791
00:33:40.630 --> 00:33:42.050
<v Speaker 1>around the Jaguar or something like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

792
00:33:42.230 --> 00:33:44.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well we are certainly moving.</v>

793
00:33:44.090 --> 00:33:49.090
<v Speaker 2>I mean if I had to guess into some sort </v>
<v Speaker 2>of a state where that becomes more and </v>

794
00:33:49.090 --> 00:33:50.870
<v Speaker 2>more aware now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't you agree?</v>

795
00:33:50.900 --> 00:33:55.900
<v Speaker 2>What becomes more and more aware that </v>
<v Speaker 2>the state that have this </v>

796
00:33:55.900 --> 00:33:56.120
<v Speaker 2>interconnectedness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this morphogenetic field,</v>

797
00:33:56.121 --> 00:34:01.121
<v Speaker 2>this idea that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we are living in social or a </v>

798
00:34:01.121 --> 00:34:05.681
<v Speaker 2>complex meshwork of biological life and </v>
<v Speaker 2>natural natural laws and physics and </v>

799
00:34:07.431 --> 00:34:12.431
<v Speaker 2>space and radiation and all of it </v>
<v Speaker 2>together combined by and it sort of </v>

800
00:34:12.431 --> 00:34:15.260
<v Speaker 2>people are realizing it now like way </v>
<v Speaker 2>more than ever before.</v>

801
00:34:15.261 --> 00:34:16.580
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was a kid,</v>

802
00:34:16.581 --> 00:34:19.550
<v Speaker 2>there was no talk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was nothing along these lines.</v>

803
00:34:19.740 --> 00:34:20.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's extraordinary.</v>

804
00:34:20.641 --> 00:34:25.641
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe that is pointing towards the </v>

805
00:34:25.641 --> 00:34:27.030
<v Speaker 1>kind of next phase of evolution as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>species.</v>

806
00:34:27.031 --> 00:34:32.031
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you think it's technology and it's </v>

807
00:34:32.031 --> 00:34:32.031
<v Speaker 1>going to do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

808
00:34:32.031 --> 00:34:35.001
<v Speaker 1>I think we have to look at technology </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself as an aspect of the evolution of </v>

809
00:34:35.001 --> 00:34:35.001
<v Speaker 1>consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

810
00:34:35.010 --> 00:34:40.010
<v Speaker 1>that actually like we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're a tool using and toolmaking </v>

811
00:34:40.010 --> 00:34:42.680
<v Speaker 1>species.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We make a new tool and then we look at </v>

812
00:34:42.680 --> 00:34:45.591
<v Speaker 1>the tool with the instrument we've made.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It reflects us back at ourself and then </v>

813
00:34:45.591 --> 00:34:46.620
<v Speaker 1>it gives us new metaphors for </v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding ourselves.</v>

814
00:34:46.621 --> 00:34:51.621
<v Speaker 1>Then it allows us to make another more </v>
<v Speaker 1>advanced tool and that creates a whole </v>

815
00:34:51.621 --> 00:34:55.821
<v Speaker 1>new set of metaphor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now we've gotten to the point in our </v>

816
00:34:55.821 --> 00:34:58.820
<v Speaker 1>tool creation and tool using or this </v>
<v Speaker 1>feedback loop is happening faster and </v>

817
00:34:58.820 --> 00:34:58.890
<v Speaker 1>faster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we're having,</v>

818
00:34:58.891 --> 00:34:59.520
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're better,</v>

819
00:34:59.521 --> 00:35:03.570
<v Speaker 1>but it's still a tool as a projection of</v>
<v Speaker 1>our consciousness,</v>

820
00:35:03.571 --> 00:35:08.571
<v Speaker 1>of our thought into the material realm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which then gives us information about </v>

821
00:35:08.571 --> 00:35:12.411
<v Speaker 1>ourselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which then leads us to create another </v>

822
00:35:12.411 --> 00:35:12.450
<v Speaker 1>tool which also advances and evolves our</v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness.</v>

823
00:35:12.451 --> 00:35:12.600
<v Speaker 1>In that</v>

824
00:35:12.660 --> 00:35:15.180
<v Speaker 2>process,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you ever get to the point where you,</v>

825
00:35:15.181 --> 00:35:15.800
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

826
00:35:15.810 --> 00:35:18.480
<v Speaker 2>you get upset that you have a connection</v>
<v Speaker 2>with these,</v>

827
00:35:18.510 --> 00:35:20.910
<v Speaker 2>these items,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these technological items like phones or</v>

828
00:35:20.911 --> 00:35:23.880
<v Speaker 2>do do not regret it ever?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or do you just accept it,</v>

829
00:35:24.110 --> 00:35:29.110
<v Speaker 1>enjoy it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I think it's very fascinating and </v>

830
00:35:29.110 --> 00:35:29.110
<v Speaker 1>it's also as we've been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of what we'll be doing with reality</v>

831
00:35:29.110 --> 00:35:32.330
<v Speaker 1>sandwich is bringing people down to work</v>
<v Speaker 1>with indigenous Shamans and elders.</v>

832
00:35:32.540 --> 00:35:36.170
<v Speaker 1>So recently we went down to the Columbia</v>
<v Speaker 1>and worked with these Kogi guys from the</v>

833
00:35:36.171 --> 00:35:38.670
<v Speaker 1>mountains in Columbia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when we hung out with them,</v>

834
00:35:38.671 --> 00:35:42.060
<v Speaker 1>we were in a place without any </v>
<v Speaker 1>electricity for eight days.</v>

835
00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:46.320
<v Speaker 1>So no phone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no computer after like a day and a half.</v>

836
00:35:46.321 --> 00:35:51.321
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what did I want all that stuff for </v>

837
00:35:51.321 --> 00:35:51.321
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

838
00:35:51.321 --> 00:35:53.150
<v Speaker 1>this is so much nicer now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Suddenly you can see the stars at night.</v>

839
00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:56.160
<v Speaker 1>You're like light a fire and the fire </v>
<v Speaker 1>goes out and you go to sleep.</v>

840
00:35:56.161 --> 00:35:57.320
<v Speaker 1>You wake up at dawn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

841
00:35:57.650 --> 00:35:58.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that actually we,</v>

842
00:35:58.990 --> 00:36:03.990
<v Speaker 1>we may find that we've gone way too far </v>
<v Speaker 1>on this technological path that we </v>

843
00:36:04.501 --> 00:36:06.660
<v Speaker 1>thought that we've had a kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

844
00:36:06.900 --> 00:36:11.900
<v Speaker 1>in a sense the religious belief of </v>
<v Speaker 1>modern society is linear technological </v>

845
00:36:11.900 --> 00:36:16.371
<v Speaker 1>progress leading to some kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>singularity or transformation that we </v>

846
00:36:16.371 --> 00:36:17.610
<v Speaker 1>may actually back up from that and be </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

847
00:36:17.611 --> 00:36:18.390
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait a second.</v>

848
00:36:18.410 --> 00:36:20.490
<v Speaker 1>Where is this stuff leading to?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

849
00:36:20.491 --> 00:36:23.310
<v Speaker 1>actually I have more plastics in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>tissues.</v>

850
00:36:23.510 --> 00:36:28.510
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my eyes are going bad from looking at </v>

851
00:36:28.510 --> 00:36:28.510
<v Speaker 1>these tiny screens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

852
00:36:28.510 --> 00:36:30.300
<v Speaker 1>why is life constantly mediated by </v>
<v Speaker 1>glowing rectangular screens anyway?</v>

853
00:36:30.570 --> 00:36:35.570
<v Speaker 1>That actually we might want to retract </v>
<v Speaker 1>from this technological path and develop</v>

854
00:36:36.391 --> 00:36:39.300
<v Speaker 1>in a different direction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which doesn't mean rejecting technology.</v>

855
00:36:39.301 --> 00:36:42.120
<v Speaker 1>It's more about mastering our </v>
<v Speaker 1>projections rather than,</v>

856
00:36:42.121 --> 00:36:44.580
<v Speaker 1>rather than feeling that we always have </v>
<v Speaker 1>to get a meshed in them.</v>

857
00:36:44.830 --> 00:36:49.830
<v Speaker 1>And then move in that direction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it sort of like riding a bike too </v>

858
00:36:49.830 --> 00:36:50.160
<v Speaker 1>fast and you're going downhill and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>

859
00:36:50.161 --> 00:36:52.530
<v Speaker 1>oh fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's good to ride this bike.</v>

860
00:36:52.531 --> 00:36:57.531
<v Speaker 1>But I've gotten kind of away from my own</v>
<v Speaker 1>biological control of this situation.</v>

861
00:36:57.720 --> 00:37:02.720
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's certainly what's happened to us </v>

862
00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:02.720
<v Speaker 1>as a species.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

863
00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:02.720
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

864
00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:06.140
<v Speaker 1>in every level we've been seduced by our</v>
<v Speaker 1>technological production projections in </v>

865
00:37:06.140 --> 00:37:07.260
<v Speaker 1>a sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've lost our grounding on the planet.</v>

866
00:37:07.970 --> 00:37:12.970
<v Speaker 2>What do you ever consider the idea that </v>
<v Speaker 2>when some sort of a weird symbiotic </v>

867
00:37:12.970 --> 00:37:16.271
<v Speaker 2>relationship where it's our job as the </v>
<v Speaker 2>host to create this environment?</v>

868
00:37:17.091 --> 00:37:19.490
<v Speaker 2>Where are the parasite,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is technology?</v>

869
00:37:19.491 --> 00:37:24.491
<v Speaker 2>There's new life form that we've created</v>
<v Speaker 2>to exist in that ultimately discard us </v>

870
00:37:24.491 --> 00:37:27.110
<v Speaker 2>because it is the next stage of not </v>
<v Speaker 2>organic life,</v>

871
00:37:27.111 --> 00:37:29.150
<v Speaker 2>but of consciousness and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness.</v>

872
00:37:29.151 --> 00:37:34.151
<v Speaker 2>The next stage of consciousness will be </v>
<v Speaker 2>artificial consciousness created by </v>

873
00:37:34.151 --> 00:37:37.241
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this consciousness that was created by </v>

874
00:37:37.241 --> 00:37:38.030
<v Speaker 2>biological life and that we are only </v>
<v Speaker 2>here to usher in the next stage.</v>

875
00:37:38.070 --> 00:37:43.070
<v Speaker 2>That next stage is in electronic form.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A stage that doesn't have emotions or </v>

876
00:37:43.070 --> 00:37:44.060
<v Speaker 2>nonsense or</v>

877
00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:46.570
<v Speaker 1>any of this shit that is not the way I </v>
<v Speaker 1>look at it.</v>

878
00:37:46.571 --> 00:37:47.620
<v Speaker 1>And we don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't.</v>

879
00:37:47.660 --> 00:37:48.190
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't,</v>

880
00:37:48.191 --> 00:37:49.540
<v Speaker 1>we don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have no,</v>

881
00:37:50.530 --> 00:37:53.530
<v Speaker 1>we have no reason at this point to </v>
<v Speaker 1>really believe that,</v>

882
00:37:53.580 --> 00:37:58.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an artificial intelligence can become </v>

883
00:37:58.580 --> 00:37:58.580
<v Speaker 1>conscious in the way we are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

884
00:37:58.580 --> 00:37:59.230
<v Speaker 1>machines may have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

885
00:37:59.260 --> 00:38:00.310
<v Speaker 1>a form,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean everything.</v>

886
00:38:00.311 --> 00:38:02.370
<v Speaker 1>We have a form of sentience but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

887
00:38:02.470 --> 00:38:03.040
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

888
00:38:03.041 --> 00:38:08.041
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we may still have a very important role </v>

889
00:38:08.041 --> 00:38:09.610
<v Speaker 1>if we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we're in our proper state,</v>

890
00:38:09.640 --> 00:38:10.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

891
00:38:10.141 --> 00:38:11.650
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the cosmic unfolding.</v>

892
00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:12.750
<v Speaker 1>But should we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if,</v>

893
00:38:13.010 --> 00:38:15.530
<v Speaker 2>or a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a step along the way,</v>

894
00:38:15.531 --> 00:38:18.050
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's to say that that step eventually a</v>

895
00:38:18.860 --> 00:38:23.860
<v Speaker 2>continues along a biological train.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it really is truly our destiny to </v>

896
00:38:23.860 --> 00:38:26.290
<v Speaker 2>create some sort of an artificial life </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not burdened down by our,</v>

897
00:38:26.310 --> 00:38:31.310
<v Speaker 2>our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our monkey DNA and all the instincts </v>

898
00:38:31.310 --> 00:38:33.941
<v Speaker 2>that we needed to evolve to this point </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the curiosity that would allow us </v>

899
00:38:33.941 --> 00:38:34.940
<v Speaker 2>to make something as crazy as artificial</v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligence.</v>

900
00:38:34.941 --> 00:38:39.941
<v Speaker 2>And maybe we're just the carriers maybe </v>
<v Speaker 2>where the carriers of the disease that </v>

901
00:38:39.941 --> 00:38:40.680
<v Speaker 2>eventually takes off and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and.</v>

902
00:38:40.770 --> 00:38:45.770
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess part of what I would suggest to </v>

903
00:38:45.770 --> 00:38:45.770
<v Speaker 1>you is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

904
00:38:45.770 --> 00:38:49.211
<v Speaker 1>part of our opportunity right now is to </v>
<v Speaker 1>become cocreative with the evolutionary </v>

905
00:38:49.211 --> 00:38:53.591
<v Speaker 1>process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that in a way means that we have to </v>

906
00:38:53.591 --> 00:38:55.991
<v Speaker 1>step into a much more responsible and </v>
<v Speaker 1>mature role where we actually become </v>

907
00:38:55.991 --> 00:39:00.551
<v Speaker 1>participants and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in a way we still kind of enjoy the </v>

908
00:39:00.551 --> 00:39:03.860
<v Speaker 1>spectacle of our own alienation and our </v>
<v Speaker 1>own potential destruction.</v>

909
00:39:04.010 --> 00:39:07.350
<v Speaker 1>So we kind of enjoy kind of like </v>
<v Speaker 1>elaborating the,</v>

910
00:39:07.351 --> 00:39:12.351
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sort of futuristic mythologies of </v>

911
00:39:12.351 --> 00:39:13.250
<v Speaker 1>how our technology is going to overwhelm</v>
<v Speaker 1>us or devour us.</v>

912
00:39:13.251 --> 00:39:18.251
<v Speaker 1>I mean that might be the case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but all we really know at this point is </v>

913
00:39:18.251 --> 00:39:18.740
<v Speaker 1>that we have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will,</v>

914
00:39:18.860 --> 00:39:23.860
<v Speaker 1>we have intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have consciousness and we're not </v>

915
00:39:23.860 --> 00:39:23.990
<v Speaker 1>using it very well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the first thing I would think that we</v>

916
00:39:23.991 --> 00:39:28.991
<v Speaker 1>would want to try to do is use it very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very effectively to see what type of </v>

917
00:39:28.991 --> 00:39:32.140
<v Speaker 1>better situation we can rapidly create.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

918
00:39:32.150 --> 00:39:35.870
<v Speaker 1>rather than fobbing off our </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility onto,</v>

919
00:39:35.871 --> 00:39:40.871
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's going to be this technological </v>

920
00:39:40.871 --> 00:39:40.871
<v Speaker 1>thing or it's too late,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we fucked the planet,</v>

921
00:39:40.871 --> 00:39:43.550
<v Speaker 1>or there's some new age psychic children</v>
<v Speaker 1>coming along.</v>

922
00:39:43.700 --> 00:39:46.120
<v Speaker 1>All that stuff to me is just bullshit </v>
<v Speaker 1>ass dodges.</v>

923
00:39:46.280 --> 00:39:51.280
<v Speaker 1>That basically is other ways that we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>avoiding taking full responsibility for </v>

924
00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:53.930
<v Speaker 1>the planetary situation that we as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>species have created,</v>

925
00:39:54.170 --> 00:39:59.170
<v Speaker 1>which is for me is really the only way </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to possibly create a better </v>

926
00:39:59.170 --> 00:39:59.660
<v Speaker 1>world in the time that we have before </v>
<v Speaker 1>things go to hell.</v>

927
00:39:59.830 --> 00:40:04.830
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do agree that as a person who's a big </v>

928
00:40:04.830 --> 00:40:04.830
<v Speaker 2>proponent of team people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

929
00:40:04.830 --> 00:40:08.970
<v Speaker 2>I definitely advocate the idea of us </v>
<v Speaker 2>figuring out what the fuck we are doing </v>

930
00:40:08.970 --> 00:40:11.350
<v Speaker 2>and making it better for all of us and </v>
<v Speaker 2>our relationship with the planet.</v>

931
00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:14.290
<v Speaker 2>But to me that doesn't seem like you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>fobbing that off.</v>

932
00:40:14.291 --> 00:40:19.291
<v Speaker 2>But the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>considering the possibility that we are </v>

933
00:40:19.291 --> 00:40:20.950
<v Speaker 2>merely here as many other parasites and </v>
<v Speaker 2>hosts are in this world.</v>

934
00:40:21.100 --> 00:40:26.100
<v Speaker 2>And you look at like grasshoppers where </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's they're infected by aquatic </v>

935
00:40:26.100 --> 00:40:30.841
<v Speaker 2>worms and aquatic worms trick the </v>
<v Speaker 2>grasshopper into jumping into water and </v>

936
00:40:30.841 --> 00:40:31.460
<v Speaker 2>the grasshopper drowns.</v>

937
00:40:31.530 --> 00:40:33.270
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the world can be born out of it.</v>

938
00:40:33.750 --> 00:40:38.160
<v Speaker 1>I personally think that we actually are </v>
<v Speaker 1>infected but by a parasitical agency.</v>

939
00:40:38.430 --> 00:40:42.690
<v Speaker 1>And I would say that agency is something</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the dominator empire complex,</v>

940
00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:47.960
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sense that we have of separation </v>

941
00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:47.960
<v Speaker 1>from nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sense that we have the right to,</v>

942
00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:49.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>annihilate ecosystems,</v>

943
00:40:49.950 --> 00:40:52.830
<v Speaker 1>dominate ecosystems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>control other people.</v>

944
00:40:53.070 --> 00:40:54.930
<v Speaker 1>The whole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole trip of empire,</v>

945
00:40:54.931 --> 00:40:59.931
<v Speaker 1>the slavery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's still tons of slavery </v>

946
00:40:59.931 --> 00:40:59.931
<v Speaker 1>around the world domination of women </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

947
00:40:59.931 --> 00:41:04.131
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the parasite that's eating us </v>

948
00:41:04.131 --> 00:41:04.131
<v Speaker 1>alive right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's where,</v>

949
00:41:04.131 --> 00:41:08.061
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we can go through our entire </v>

950
00:41:08.061 --> 00:41:08.061
<v Speaker 1>initiatory process,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

951
00:41:08.061 --> 00:41:08.061
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can,</v>

952
00:41:08.061 --> 00:41:09.090
<v Speaker 1>we can begin to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

953
00:41:09.120 --> 00:41:12.120
<v Speaker 1>find the antidote or the cure to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's not about,</v>

954
00:41:12.390 --> 00:41:14.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from my perspective,</v>

955
00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:16.920
<v Speaker 1>like giving it up to technology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

956
00:41:16.921 --> 00:41:20.080
<v Speaker 1>as an amazing thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's more like reclaiming our,</v>

957
00:41:20.081 --> 00:41:21.270
<v Speaker 1>our human capacity.</v>

958
00:41:21.450 --> 00:41:22.130
<v Speaker 1>And for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

959
00:41:22.131 --> 00:41:27.131
<v Speaker 1>that's really where the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the knowledge of the indigenous people </v>

960
00:41:27.131 --> 00:41:27.131
<v Speaker 1>is not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

961
00:41:27.131 --> 00:41:28.290
<v Speaker 1>folk tale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not silly,</v>

962
00:41:28.291 --> 00:41:30.510
<v Speaker 1>it's not worthless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's actually something that,</v>

963
00:41:30.511 --> 00:41:31.080
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

964
00:41:31.081 --> 00:41:34.130
<v Speaker 1>those of us who care about you seeking </v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

965
00:41:34.150 --> 00:41:37.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>move into an evolutionary framework.</v>

966
00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:38.690
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

967
00:41:38.740 --> 00:41:39.330
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

968
00:41:39.340 --> 00:41:41.450
<v Speaker 1>they have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have tools and gifts for us.</v>

969
00:41:41.660 --> 00:41:44.350
<v Speaker 1>And that's why part of what I've been </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to do over the last couple,</v>

970
00:41:44.370 --> 00:41:49.370
<v Speaker 1>well a lot of my work but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now in a different way is build </v>

971
00:41:49.370 --> 00:41:52.661
<v Speaker 1>bridges to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the indigenous people and their </v>

972
00:41:52.661 --> 00:41:52.661
<v Speaker 1>knowledge systems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

973
00:41:52.661 --> 00:41:54.110
<v Speaker 1>So I'm working now with the Kogi in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Columbia and also</v>

974
00:41:54.140 --> 00:41:57.070
<v Speaker 2>the sequoia from Ecuador.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

975
00:41:57.110 --> 00:41:57.700
<v Speaker 2>wha.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>

976
00:41:57.701 --> 00:42:00.620
<v Speaker 2>what I meant by that was not that it has</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be,</v>

977
00:42:01.290 --> 00:42:03.590
<v Speaker 2>it almost like when I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I,</v>

978
00:42:03.620 --> 00:42:06.350
<v Speaker 2>when I look at the relationship that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>have with,</v>

979
00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:11.560
<v Speaker 2>with technology and I look at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship that different parents </v>

980
00:42:11.560 --> 00:42:14.420
<v Speaker 2>sites and different hosts have it just </v>
<v Speaker 2>as a consideration.</v>

981
00:42:14.421 --> 00:42:19.421
<v Speaker 2>You have to think about the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 2>our society is completely obsessed with </v>

982
00:42:19.421 --> 00:42:23.411
<v Speaker 2>pushing innovation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're completely obsessed and I often </v>

983
00:42:23.411 --> 00:42:24.530
<v Speaker 2>look at the dominator culture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you describe,</v>

984
00:42:24.531 --> 00:42:24.980
<v Speaker 2>and I say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

985
00:42:24.981 --> 00:42:25.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're right.</v>

986
00:42:25.721 --> 00:42:30.721
<v Speaker 2>I mean that is a huge fucking problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>War and the domination of other </v>

987
00:42:30.721 --> 00:42:34.061
<v Speaker 2>countries and battling for resources,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what do you say to people that say </v>

988
00:42:34.061 --> 00:42:36.770
<v Speaker 2>that there's no way you can have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>society that,</v>

989
00:42:36.890 --> 00:42:41.890
<v Speaker 2>that reaches this particular height this</v>
<v Speaker 2>fast without that as a byproduct and </v>

990
00:42:43.311 --> 00:42:48.311
<v Speaker 2>that in fact the reason why people push </v>
<v Speaker 2>so hard to innovate and to create new </v>

991
00:42:48.311 --> 00:42:49.690
<v Speaker 2>things and conquer new,</v>
<v Speaker 2>new,</v>

992
00:42:49.730 --> 00:42:52.430
<v Speaker 2>new new boundaries both scientifically </v>
<v Speaker 2>and socially,</v>

993
00:42:52.700 --> 00:42:57.700
<v Speaker 2>is that it's all almost a byproduct of </v>
<v Speaker 2>this desire to innovate and create and </v>

994
00:42:58.400 --> 00:43:03.400
<v Speaker 2>produce this next thing and that this is</v>
<v Speaker 2>all a part of us creating some </v>

995
00:43:03.740 --> 00:43:04.750
<v Speaker 2>artificial thing.</v>

996
00:43:04.750 --> 00:43:05.600
<v Speaker 2>Some intelligence.</v>

997
00:43:05.740 --> 00:43:07.110
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we have to.</v>

998
00:43:07.140 --> 00:43:12.140
<v Speaker 1>We have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have to break the trance of </v>

999
00:43:12.140 --> 00:43:14.601
<v Speaker 1>technology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is not to say that we reject </v>

1000
00:43:14.601 --> 00:43:17.031
<v Speaker 1>technology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we have to break that trance that </v>

1001
00:43:17.031 --> 00:43:17.031
<v Speaker 1>somehow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1002
00:43:17.031 --> 00:43:19.770
<v Speaker 1>there's this linear technological </v>
<v Speaker 1>progress is necessarily,</v>

1003
00:43:19.800 --> 00:43:22.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bringing us to something super amazing.</v>

1004
00:43:23.160 --> 00:43:28.160
<v Speaker 1>And for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the shift in the future is more to a </v>

1005
00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:29.910
<v Speaker 1>kind of psycho technical phase of </v>
<v Speaker 1>development.</v>

1006
00:43:30.370 --> 00:43:31.750
<v Speaker 1>By that I mean that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1007
00:43:31.770 --> 00:43:32.970
<v Speaker 1>if you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1008
00:43:32.971 --> 00:43:35.850
<v Speaker 1>if you've had the DMT and the Ayahuasca </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiences,</v>

1009
00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:37.680
<v Speaker 1>the yoga experiences and so on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1010
00:43:37.690 --> 00:43:40.590
<v Speaker 1>you recognize there are these vast </v>
<v Speaker 1>dimensions,</v>

1011
00:43:40.591 --> 00:43:45.591
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>within the psyche that are basically </v>

1012
00:43:45.591 --> 00:43:48.051
<v Speaker 1>unknown incontinence and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in a sense that for me is where the </v>

1013
00:43:48.331 --> 00:43:51.090
<v Speaker 1>action is going to lie for us in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>future,</v>

1014
00:43:51.390 --> 00:43:56.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as well as potentially exploring other </v>

1015
00:43:56.390 --> 00:43:56.670
<v Speaker 1>planets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>other solar systems and all this stuff.</v>

1016
00:43:56.670 --> 00:43:59.550
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at the moment we really more need to</v>

1017
00:43:59.551 --> 00:44:04.551
<v Speaker 1>get control of our thought projections.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the only way to do that is to </v>

1018
00:44:04.551 --> 00:44:07.260
<v Speaker 1>undergo an initiatory process that </v>
<v Speaker 1>involves,</v>

1019
00:44:07.350 --> 00:44:12.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of getting into our unconscious </v>

1020
00:44:12.350 --> 00:44:13.070
<v Speaker 1>patterns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Initiatory process.</v>

1021
00:44:14.020 --> 00:44:15.330
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1022
00:44:15.331 --> 00:44:16.230
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean like,</v>

1023
00:44:16.231 --> 00:44:17.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hanging,</v>

1024
00:44:17.521 --> 00:44:20.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fasting or hanging by your packs for six</v>

1025
00:44:20.011 --> 00:44:23.100
<v Speaker 1>days or taking Iowasca,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1026
00:44:23.130 --> 00:44:25.240
<v Speaker 1>for a couple of weeks until you know </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

1027
00:44:25.241 --> 00:44:26.250
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're so nauseous.</v>

1028
00:44:26.251 --> 00:44:28.390
<v Speaker 1>Did you can't believe it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but still vision.</v>

1029
00:44:28.391 --> 00:44:30.930
<v Speaker 1>The insights keep coming up and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>begin to heal.</v>

1030
00:44:31.170 --> 00:44:33.180
<v Speaker 1>Have your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1031
00:44:33.230 --> 00:44:33.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1032
00:44:35.210 --> 00:44:38.930
<v Speaker 2>pathetic humanness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you save the setting humanness,</v>

1033
00:44:38.931 --> 00:44:43.931
<v Speaker 2>but then why are you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you completely averse to the idea that </v>

1034
00:44:43.931 --> 00:44:44.090
<v Speaker 2>we are just here to develop something </v>
<v Speaker 2>else,</v>

1035
00:44:44.330 --> 00:44:49.330
<v Speaker 2>which I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we obviously are just a step along the </v>

1036
00:44:49.330 --> 00:44:49.330
<v Speaker 2>way and will be unrecognizable few </v>
<v Speaker 2>million years.</v>

1037
00:44:49.330 --> 00:44:49.340
<v Speaker 2>Think that what we're here to do</v>

1038
00:44:49.350 --> 00:44:50.760
<v Speaker 1>develop is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1039
00:44:50.820 --> 00:44:51.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>integrity,</v>

1040
00:44:51.961 --> 00:44:54.630
<v Speaker 1>consciousness and willpower.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And once we've developed that,</v>

1041
00:44:54.660 --> 00:44:57.960
<v Speaker 1>then we can think about what else we may</v>
<v Speaker 1>develop at the moment.</v>

1042
00:44:57.961 --> 00:44:59.460
<v Speaker 1>We don't have that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just think we do.</v>

1043
00:44:59.570 --> 00:45:02.160
<v Speaker 2>Do you feel happy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you feel happy that you're.</v>

1044
00:45:02.180 --> 00:45:02.910
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>

1045
00:45:02.911 --> 00:45:06.680
<v Speaker 2>I believe you are one of the people that</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of an agent of this sort of,</v>

1046
00:45:06.681 --> 00:45:08.000
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe right now,</v>

1047
00:45:08.001 --> 00:45:11.330
<v Speaker 2>currently we're in a very unusual age of</v>
<v Speaker 2>enlightenment.</v>

1048
00:45:11.540 --> 00:45:13.230
<v Speaker 2>And I think that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1049
00:45:13.390 --> 00:45:18.390
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the level of enlightenment that we've </v>

1050
00:45:18.390 --> 00:45:18.920
<v Speaker 2>achieved a culturally over the last </v>
<v Speaker 2>year.</v>

1051
00:45:19.250 --> 00:45:21.050
<v Speaker 2>Certainly not everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not last year,</v>

1052
00:45:21.051 --> 00:45:23.450
<v Speaker 2>last decade,</v>
<v Speaker 2>certainly not over everybody,</v>

1053
00:45:23.451 --> 00:45:28.451
<v Speaker 2>but generally has been more than </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything that I can ever remember in my </v>

1054
00:45:28.451 --> 00:45:32.771
<v Speaker 2>lifetime.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And people like you that are pushing </v>

1055
00:45:32.771 --> 00:45:35.501
<v Speaker 2>these ideas and people like you that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to challenge the way people view </v>

1056
00:45:35.501 --> 00:45:38.921
<v Speaker 2>things and the standard standard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a predetermined patterns of behavior we </v>

1057
00:45:38.921 --> 00:45:42.650
<v Speaker 2>seem to have come to accept you're a </v>
<v Speaker 2>part of moving this thing along these.</v>

1058
00:45:42.771 --> 00:45:47.771
<v Speaker 2>These kind of discussions are part of </v>
<v Speaker 2>moving this thing along where people in </v>

1059
00:45:47.771 --> 00:45:48.680
<v Speaker 2>college or people who are getting their </v>
<v Speaker 2>first jobs,</v>

1060
00:45:48.681 --> 00:45:53.681
<v Speaker 2>people were starting their own first </v>
<v Speaker 2>business versus they're stopping and </v>

1061
00:45:53.681 --> 00:45:56.150
<v Speaker 2>they're reconsidering the direction that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they move forward and what their motives</v>

1062
00:45:56.151 --> 00:45:58.550
<v Speaker 2>are and whether or not they're just </v>
<v Speaker 2>caught up in momentum.</v>

1063
00:45:59.240 --> 00:45:59.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1064
00:45:59.780 --> 00:46:03.890
<v Speaker 1>I feel extremely humble and lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you feel obligated?</v>

1065
00:46:04.450 --> 00:46:07.330
<v Speaker 1>I feel tremendous obligation and </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility to,</v>

1066
00:46:07.331 --> 00:46:09.350
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do what I can to help out,</v>

1067
00:46:09.620 --> 00:46:10.070
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1068
00:46:11.430 --> 00:46:13.730
<v Speaker 2>So what is there a way to stop this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>

1069
00:46:13.750 --> 00:46:15.570
<v Speaker 2>what is the number one problem that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>have?</v>

1070
00:46:15.571 --> 00:46:18.810
<v Speaker 2>If we have a urine for destruction and </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're constantly.</v>

1071
00:46:19.070 --> 00:46:24.070
<v Speaker 1>The number one problem that we have is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that consciousness and subjectivity are </v>

1072
00:46:24.070 --> 00:46:28.841
<v Speaker 1>mass produced by a system that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically keeping us in a state of a,</v>

1073
00:46:29.010 --> 00:46:32.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pacivity and ignorance</v>

1074
00:46:32.680 --> 00:46:37.680
<v Speaker 2>system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A natural system is that system there </v>

1075
00:46:37.680 --> 00:46:40.081
<v Speaker 2>because like everything else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the way Alpha wolves treat Beta </v>

1076
00:46:40.081 --> 00:46:40.081
<v Speaker 2>wolves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1077
00:46:40.081 --> 00:46:42.100
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that system is almost set up in place so</v>

1078
00:46:42.101 --> 00:46:43.750
<v Speaker 2>that there is an antagonist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

1079
00:46:43.750 --> 00:46:48.750
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see it as an evolutionary process and </v>

1080
00:46:48.750 --> 00:46:48.750
<v Speaker 1>just as like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1081
00:46:48.750 --> 00:46:48.910
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the embryo has to push against the shell</v>

1082
00:46:48.911 --> 00:46:50.300
<v Speaker 1>and finally breakthrough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1083
00:46:50.350 --> 00:46:51.910
<v Speaker 1>or doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1084
00:46:52.830 --> 00:46:54.820
<v Speaker 2>inspired by an antagonist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

1085
00:46:54.850 --> 00:46:55.550
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ali,</v>

1086
00:46:55.570 --> 00:46:56.410
<v Speaker 2>you needed frazier.</v>

1087
00:46:56.480 --> 00:46:57.440
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1088
00:46:57.441 --> 00:46:57.940
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1089
00:46:57.950 --> 00:46:58.520
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1090
00:46:58.521 --> 00:46:59.090
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1091
00:46:59.091 --> 00:47:00.930
<v Speaker 1>we definitely have a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1092
00:47:01.380 --> 00:47:05.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a powerful military industrial,</v>

1093
00:47:05.870 --> 00:47:10.870
<v Speaker 1>corporate empire complex that has sunk </v>
<v Speaker 1>its roots into our subconscious </v>

1094
00:47:11.030 --> 00:47:16.030
<v Speaker 1>processes and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and our psychology and it is going to </v>

1095
00:47:16.030 --> 00:47:19.231
<v Speaker 1>require,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it requires a lot of disciplined effort </v>

1096
00:47:19.231 --> 00:47:22.390
<v Speaker 1>to recognize how it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how it is operating through us on so </v>

1097
00:47:22.390 --> 00:47:26.801
<v Speaker 1>many different levels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then begin to turn it around from </v>

1098
00:47:26.801 --> 00:47:26.801
<v Speaker 1>within.</v>

1099
00:47:26.860 --> 00:47:28.390
<v Speaker 2>That's the facts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pitches.</v>

1100
00:47:29.140 --> 00:47:29.980
<v Speaker 2>That's about it.</v>

1101
00:47:30.250 --> 00:47:33.770
<v Speaker 1>That's all you're going to absorb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't done this.</v>

1102
00:47:34.630 --> 00:47:39.630
<v Speaker 1>This is an awesome conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you very much for coming over </v>

1103
00:47:39.630 --> 00:47:39.630
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And my pleasure.</v>

00:47:39.630 --> 00:47:43.340
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for having me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything that I thought it would be </v>

1105
00:47:43.340 --> 00:47:45.220
<v Speaker 1>plus more if anybody needs to get ahold </v>
<v Speaker 1>of you or check out your stuff,</v>

1106
00:47:45.221 --> 00:47:47.170
<v Speaker 1>which should they do and what did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what did you hand me here?</v>

1107
00:47:48.150 --> 00:47:50.900
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you a quick rundown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Evolver.net</v>

1108
00:47:50.901 --> 00:47:54.010
<v Speaker 1>as our social network all over dot and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they have the evolve or social movement.</v>

1109
00:47:54.011 --> 00:47:56.110
<v Speaker 1>We have about 50 groups around the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

1110
00:47:56.111 --> 00:47:58.090
<v Speaker 1>Mostly in the US who beat up every </v>
<v Speaker 1>month.</v>

1111
00:47:58.330 --> 00:48:03.330
<v Speaker 1>We do consciousness raising.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We create a theme that could be the </v>

1112
00:48:03.330 --> 00:48:04.480
<v Speaker 1>future of psychedelics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could be extra terrestrials,</v>

1113
00:48:04.481 --> 00:48:06.560
<v Speaker 1>it could be sustainability or </v>
<v Speaker 1>permaculture.</v>

1114
00:48:06.990 --> 00:48:11.990
<v Speaker 1>We use those as both gathering points </v>
<v Speaker 1>where people raise consciousness and </v>

1115
00:48:11.990 --> 00:48:15.661
<v Speaker 1>learn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then also nexus points for </v>

1116
00:48:15.661 --> 00:48:15.661
<v Speaker 1>communities to build.</v>

1117

<v Speaker 1>it's a way for,</v>

1124
00:48:26.740 --> 00:48:30.370
<v Speaker 1>for a kind of global community that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to understand this new paradigm.</v>

1125
00:48:30.371 --> 00:48:32.740
