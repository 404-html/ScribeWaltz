68
00:02:01.501 --> 00:02:02.261
<v Speaker 1>house policy.</v>

77
00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:15.690
<v Speaker 1>I have a thought of you.</v>

78
00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.760
<v Speaker 1>I was at the coach and horses tangles out of my fucking mind and I couldn't walk</v>

79
00:02:20.761 --> 00:02:21.520

<v Speaker 1>So I went to [inaudible] because he had the open door policy and I go to stay at</v>

83
00:02:26.701 --> 00:02:27.010
<v Speaker 1>hopes,</v>

84
00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.420
<v Speaker 1>I hope with the go.</v>

85
00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.310
<v Speaker 1>He's got the bunk beds I get on.</v>

86
00:02:29.311 --> 00:02:29.640
<v Speaker 1>But no,</v>

87
00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:30.810
<v Speaker 1>at this time it was the living room.</v>

88
00:02:30.811 --> 00:02:31.644
<v Speaker 1>He just had a cut.</v>

89
00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.480
<v Speaker 1>I get on the car cause I couldn't even make it to the fucking bed tonight</v>

90
00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.120
<v Speaker 1>there's an earthquake and I wake up to the house and they opened my eyes</v>

91
00:02:39.121 --> 00:02:40.440
<v Speaker 1>sideways and I see the clock.</v>

92
00:02:40.441 --> 00:02:41.820
<v Speaker 1>So I'm focusing on the clock,</v>

93
00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:43.890
<v Speaker 1>but the fucking earth is moving,</v>

94
00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:44.753
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'm saying?</v>

95
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.840
<v Speaker 1>And that was just,</v>

96
00:02:45.841 --> 00:02:47.100
<v Speaker 1>that's I think the last time I was.</v>

99
00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.470
<v Speaker 1>I still live there all the time.</v>

100
00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.490
<v Speaker 1>I still beat the horn when I go by like a motherfucker Hennigan's now just kinda</v>

109
00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:10.600
<v Speaker 1>I was going to change I,</v>

110
00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.130
<v Speaker 1>I was trying to get ahold of you.</v>

111
00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:13.300
<v Speaker 1>If,</v>

112
00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:16.090
<v Speaker 1>if we have to do this the next day I'm going to change my flight.</v>

113
00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.691
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

114
00:03:16.691 --> 00:03:17.800
<v Speaker 1>I can just fly.</v>

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:19.780
<v Speaker 1>I could fucking 10 days off.</v>

116
00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:21.700
<v Speaker 1>I'll just fly to fucking somewhere.</v>

117
00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:22.750
<v Speaker 1>I never do that.</v>

118
00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.190
<v Speaker 1>Just fly somewhere for a vacation.</v>

119
00:03:24.191 --> 00:03:25.840
<v Speaker 1>I had my passport in Costa Rica.</v>

120
00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:27.640
<v Speaker 1>If I'm going to extend my stay here,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'll probably be fucked up when I leave.</v>

123
00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.863
<v Speaker 1>Why not?</v>

124
00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:37.110
<v Speaker 1>And then just the thought of lax fucking ruined that entire fantasy.</v>
