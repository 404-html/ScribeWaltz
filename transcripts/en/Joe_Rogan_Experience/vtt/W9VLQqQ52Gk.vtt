00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:02.593

<v 1>Round two.</v>

3
00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:04.760
You dirty freaks.

4
00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:05.803
USTREAM.

5
00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:06.530
Dot.

6
00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:08.460
TV Slash Chow.

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:11.113
<v 0>MMM.</v>

8
00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:12.131
<v 1>All right,</v>

9
00:00:12.131 --> 00:00:12.820
we're back.

10
00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:13.330
Um,

11
00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:14.163
so crash,

12
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:15.670
you've been doing this,

13
00:00:15.671 --> 00:00:17.870
you've been in this tank business longer than that.

14
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:18.640
I fuck that up.

15
00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:18.791
No,

16
00:00:18.791 --> 00:00:19.380
I didn't.

17
00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.400
You've been in this tank business longer than I've known you.

18
00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:22.240
You when,

19
00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.100
when did you get started making these fucking things?

20
00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:25.503
Um,

21
00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.580
about 15 years at 99.

22
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:28.750
And what what,

23
00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:29.710
what brought you into that?

24
00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:30.491
Well,

25
00:00:30.491 --> 00:00:30.730
yeah,

26
00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:32.020
I think it was with me.

27
00:00:32.021 --> 00:00:33.180
I was ready to check.

28
00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:33.430
You know,

29
00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:34.300
I used to have a,

30
00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:37.180
I used to have nightclubs and I was in the music industry and I had a,

31
00:00:37.181 --> 00:00:38.014
um,

32
00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:38.351
you know,

33
00:00:38.351 --> 00:00:39.041
narcotics.

34
00:00:39.041 --> 00:00:40.990
I was into drugs and stuff.

35
00:00:40.991 --> 00:00:42.140
I like to do that for,

36
00:00:42.141 --> 00:00:42.430
uh,

37
00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:42.730
you know,

38
00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:44.540
but is it the time was in,

39
00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:44.771
you know,

40
00:00:44.771 --> 00:00:47.140
in the 80s and stuff and there's a music industry.

41
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.080
We used to have nightclubs.

42
00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.620
They said do a management.

43
00:00:50.621 --> 00:00:53.890
And then I want to do an audio later on back in the 70s where the Stevie ray

44
00:00:53.891 --> 00:00:54.820
Vaughan and stuff like that,

45
00:00:54.821 --> 00:00:56.470
blues clubs in the DC.

46
00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:57.880
And then we went on like in the 80s,

47
00:00:57.881 --> 00:00:58.431
and had like a,

48
00:00:58.431 --> 00:00:58.640
you know,

49
00:00:58.640 --> 00:00:59.291
culture club,

50
00:00:59.291 --> 00:01:02.670
they rhythmics and I've worked with account base and then later on even to do

51
00:01:02.671 --> 00:01:07.390
the audio at Caesar's and I went in the showroom in there and Liberace and on

52
00:01:07.391 --> 00:01:08.740
and on it in a different,

53
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.770
a zine or whatever,

54
00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:11.140
you know,

55
00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.930
shows from then I,

56
00:01:13.931 --> 00:01:14.560
uh,

57
00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.930
we,

58
00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:15.763
uh,

59
00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:16.700
used to tour,

60
00:01:16.701 --> 00:01:16.870
you know,

61
00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:20.590
a little bit and then these gigs and then I got a band going there.

62
00:01:20.591 --> 00:01:21.424
And uh,

63
00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.640
we used to open up for one of the bands I was touring with and then we take

64
00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:25.150
great.

65
00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:26.050
So I got interested in like,

66
00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.191
oh,

67
00:01:26.191 --> 00:01:27.040
an hour to make some,

68
00:01:27.041 --> 00:01:27.874
it'd be in this,

69
00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:29.080
make it doing music.

70
00:01:29.081 --> 00:01:33.370
And you've got these studios and had 60 of those Hollywood.

71
00:01:33.371 --> 00:01:35.380
And then finally I was done,

72
00:01:35.381 --> 00:01:35.590
you know,

73
00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.340
I had enough of these people,

74
00:01:37.341 --> 00:01:40.780
I was strung out on heroin and I used to say,

75
00:01:40.781 --> 00:01:41.021
Oh,

76
00:01:41.021 --> 00:01:41.810
I've had enough.

77
00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.000
Not Functional though.

78
00:01:43.001 --> 00:01:44.530
I'm not a stealer.

79
00:01:44.531 --> 00:01:45.364
I don't steal.

80
00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.821
I'm a,

81
00:01:45.821 --> 00:01:49.720
I'm a functioning guy back then and I don't steal and I work and I do jobs,

82
00:01:49.721 --> 00:01:51.090
but I used to get,

83
00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:52.690
I used to like to really get high,

84
00:01:52.691 --> 00:01:52.871
you know,

85
00:01:52.871 --> 00:01:53.051
I was,

86
00:01:53.051 --> 00:01:53.884
I was part of what the,

87
00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.910
you know what we did,

88
00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.830
but so I was finally done with that and I,

89
00:01:57.831 --> 00:02:01.270
I kicked the dope and whenever he went on out there to Vegas from Hollywood,

90
00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.270
left my buildings and I built a recording studio.

91
00:02:04.271 --> 00:02:05.260
I've got a ranch out there,

92
00:02:05.261 --> 00:02:06.280
10 miles south of town,

93
00:02:06.281 --> 00:02:08.980
build or build a studio and there was Emma guys come out and we'll do some

94
00:02:08.981 --> 00:02:11.080
recording out there at this a ranch.

95
00:02:11.081 --> 00:02:13.330
I got there and I'm in the back there.

96
00:02:13.331 --> 00:02:14.820
I just built it out of my head now.

97
00:02:14.821 --> 00:02:15.010
No,

98
00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.010
there was like an old water thing from what the horses were getting water from

99
00:02:18.011 --> 00:02:21.790
or whatever it was and my head in there and I was working on my voice and when I

100
00:02:21.791 --> 00:02:22.960
pulled my head out,

101
00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:24.260
all of a sudden I,

102
00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.860
I know I'm supposed to build these deprivation chambers.

103
00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:29.080
I don't even know what is a deprivation chamber.

104
00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.730
It hits.

105
00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:30.250
So you had,

106
00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:31.240
you had like this idea,

107
00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.691
Jamie,

108
00:02:31.691 --> 00:02:31.870
keep,

109
00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:32.703
take this down off it.

110
00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:33.700
Just go with the screen.

111
00:02:33.701 --> 00:02:34.534
So we could just see those,

112
00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.000
those photos at round before I get distracted sometimes.

113
00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.973
Yeah.

114
00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:38.740
Um,

115
00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:41.290
so you just add a nowhere had this idea.

116
00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:42.440
It wasn't even an ideal.

117
00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.770
It wasn't an idea cause I didn't even know what it was.

118
00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:45.760
So just hit you.

119
00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:47.190
And it wasn't my voice,

120
00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:48.790
a light or nothing.

121
00:02:48.791 --> 00:02:51.760
It was just all of a sudden I had my head in that thing.

122
00:02:51.761 --> 00:02:52.390
I was that.

123
00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:53.560
And when I pulled my head out,

124
00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:57.220
I knew I'm supposed to build deprivation chambers and get ever people to do it.

125
00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:00.400
I don't know what is a deprivation or nothing.

126
00:03:00.401 --> 00:03:01.840
I just built a recording studio.

127
00:03:01.841 --> 00:03:02.680
I got no interest.

128
00:03:02.681 --> 00:03:04.150
I'm already doing what I wanna do.

129
00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.200
I don't need to change a life or I've quit doing what it was that was holding me

130
00:03:08.201 --> 00:03:08.830
up,

131
00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:09.071
you know,

132
00:03:09.071 --> 00:03:10.720
so I was on my path already,

133
00:03:10.721 --> 00:03:12.880
but it hit me so hard.

134
00:03:12.881 --> 00:03:15.700
And at that moment I was relieved of all my previous,

135
00:03:15.701 --> 00:03:16.420
uh,

136
00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.691
you know,

137
00:03:16.691 --> 00:03:17.230
like I had a,

138
00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:17.441
you know,

139
00:03:17.441 --> 00:03:18.170
you think back and say,

140
00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.311
oh,

141
00:03:18.311 --> 00:03:21.760
I used to have this or I used to have that I'd built empires and then collapse

142
00:03:21.761 --> 00:03:22.541
them over the years.

143
00:03:22.541 --> 00:03:22.750
You know,

144
00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:23.770
I worked,

145
00:03:23.771 --> 00:03:27.580
worked really hard and then because too much fun wrecked it every time,

146
00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.821
you know,

147
00:03:27.821 --> 00:03:29.710
so I'd been through and at that point in my life he's thinking,

148
00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.881
bummer,

149
00:03:30.881 --> 00:03:31.091
you know,

150
00:03:31.091 --> 00:03:31.871
I kept thinking about,

151
00:03:31.871 --> 00:03:33.820
now I'm starting over again and whatever.

152
00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:36.100
And at the moment when I pull my hand out of there,

153
00:03:36.101 --> 00:03:37.900
this no longer affected me at all.

154
00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:39.300
None of my past was.

155
00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:44.430
<v 2>So you lean into this thing that they use to hold water or water for animals.</v>

156
00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:45.670
Horses probably.

157
00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.910
And you look in there and you pull your head out and all of a sudden you have

158
00:03:48.911 --> 00:03:49.744
this mandate,

159
00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.030
you have to build sensory deprivation tanks.

160
00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:54.550
So you essentially got a message from God.

161
00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:55.900
I don't believe in God.

162
00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:56.291
Listen,

163
00:03:56.291 --> 00:03:56.680
Pal,

164
00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:57.513
he was talking to you.

165
00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:58.810
Lead them.

166
00:03:58.810 --> 00:03:59.591
If it wasn't God,

167
00:03:59.591 --> 00:04:00.424
who was it?

168
00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:01.200
Anything.

169
00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.200
I don't know what it was.

170
00:04:02.201 --> 00:04:03.160
I'm confused.

171
00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:06.430
Does indicate though some sort of superior,

172
00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:07.293
uh,

173
00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:10.450
well think about the move the chain of events that happened.

174
00:04:10.451 --> 00:04:12.160
Now you create that thing,

175
00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:12.820
you know,

176
00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:13.061
you,

177
00:04:13.061 --> 00:04:13.540
you,

178
00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:16.000
you improve upon the existing dynamic,

179
00:04:16.001 --> 00:04:19.210
the existing design rather in a substantial way.

180
00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:20.530
You become obsessed with it.

181
00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:22.210
You and I get hooked up.

182
00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:24.040
We make videos about it.

183
00:04:24.041 --> 00:04:25.090
We started putting it out.

184
00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:26.830
You're doing a podcast now.

185
00:04:26.831 --> 00:04:28.150
More people are finding out about it.

186
00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:29.470
More people are opening these centers.

187
00:04:29.471 --> 00:04:32.850
I get every time I go to a town like it seems there,

188
00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:33.130
if it,

189
00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:35.320
if it's town that has a sensory deprivation tank,

190
00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:38.620
I get these offers to come stop by and check them out and say,

191
00:04:38.621 --> 00:04:38.861
hey,

192
00:04:38.861 --> 00:04:41.530
we started doing it because we heard about it on the podcast.

193
00:04:41.531 --> 00:04:43.540
It's a great way to make a living.

194
00:04:43.541 --> 00:04:44.321
We love floating.

195
00:04:44.321 --> 00:04:45.400
We'd love the benefits of it.

196
00:04:45.401 --> 00:04:46.450
We just want to thank you so much.

197
00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:47.403
That happens.

198
00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:48.150
All the

199
00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:48.350
<v 1>Tom,</v>

200
00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:49.081
you're in the movie,

201
00:04:49.081 --> 00:04:49.500
man.

202
00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:50.333
You're in the movie.

203
00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:52.021
What happened?

204
00:04:52.021 --> 00:04:52.651
Happened and,

205
00:04:52.651 --> 00:04:52.871
and,

206
00:04:52.871 --> 00:04:54.900
and what's going to happen is yet to be,

207
00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:57.080
because what's coming up still is,

208
00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:01.440
is much larger than what's happened so far with tanks,

209
00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:02.490
with these chambers.

210
00:05:02.491 --> 00:05:02.761
Right?

211
00:05:02.761 --> 00:05:03.980
We think they're going to be ever,

212
00:05:03.981 --> 00:05:04.721
I don't think so.

213
00:05:04.721 --> 00:05:04.841
I,

214
00:05:04.841 --> 00:05:05.121
I'm,

215
00:05:05.121 --> 00:05:06.690
I'm pretty well sure of it at this point.

216
00:05:06.691 --> 00:05:06.991
Cause I,

217
00:05:06.991 --> 00:05:07.621
I have,

218
00:05:07.621 --> 00:05:08.454
uh,

219
00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:13.730
I have a realistic vision of the situation and I'm convinced at this point that

220
00:05:14.581 --> 00:05:16.980
indeed it is going to work.

221
00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:17.701
You know,

222
00:05:17.701 --> 00:05:18.920
and I don't know the,

223
00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:20.760
how it all is going to turn out of course,

224
00:05:20.761 --> 00:05:25.761
but I think that we're having a chance now and that's why this situation is so

225
00:05:26.341 --> 00:05:27.031
important to me.

226
00:05:27.031 --> 00:05:27.301
This,

227
00:05:27.301 --> 00:05:30.840
this just infection and this electrical and all these,

228
00:05:30.841 --> 00:05:33.390
these features that have to do with health and safety.

229
00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.400
So this can become a safe,

230
00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:37.560
healthy and uh,

231
00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:38.401
a,

232
00:05:38.401 --> 00:05:38.810
uh,

233
00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:39.860
<v 2>just like restaurants.</v>

234
00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:42.080
Just like anything else that involves cleanliness.

235
00:05:42.081 --> 00:05:42.980
This is very important.

236
00:05:42.981 --> 00:05:43.880
It's a public service.

237
00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:45.230
And then for you,

238
00:05:45.231 --> 00:05:48.740
what's important is that it protects the benefits of this service where all of

239
00:05:48.741 --> 00:05:53.090
the negative aspects of it are eliminated with foresight thinking about it in

240
00:05:53.091 --> 00:05:53.660
advance.

241
00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:55.820
And I think that's super important and I really,

242
00:05:55.821 --> 00:05:57.140
I really commend you on that.

243
00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:02.270
And you also have these really fascinating ideas about how to go about that.

244
00:06:02.271 --> 00:06:02.991
I mean your,

245
00:06:02.991 --> 00:06:03.351
your,

246
00:06:03.351 --> 00:06:04.110
your systems,

247
00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:06.230
the cleanliness and all of the ozone,

248
00:06:06.231 --> 00:06:07.270
the filters and the,

249
00:06:07.271 --> 00:06:07.451
the,

250
00:06:07.451 --> 00:06:07.681
the,

251
00:06:07.681 --> 00:06:08.514
the,

252
00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:10.010
the sensitivity of the filters.

253
00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:11.420
It's all incredible stuff.

254
00:06:11.421 --> 00:06:12.620
Incredibly detailed stuff.

255
00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:13.100
Yeah,

256
00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:15.680
we've spent a lot of time keeping getting better.

257
00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:18.520
We're just now finishing up with a whole nother bunch of stuff

258
00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:19.423
<v 1>through that.</v>

259
00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:22.830
It's one thing after the next thing I see when I first started this I was using,

260
00:06:22.831 --> 00:06:23.664
apart from,

261
00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:24.781
you know,

262
00:06:24.781 --> 00:06:25.830
this or that or whatever,

263
00:06:25.831 --> 00:06:28.440
there was like no parts for anything that you were trying to make.

264
00:06:28.441 --> 00:06:31.560
So you have to like really try to figure out how to improvise.

265
00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:32.910
Whereas now though,

266
00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:36.630
all of every single component that we use is made for us.

267
00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:39.400
We have very specific providers.

268
00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:42.900
All of this stuff that we've refined over the years,

269
00:06:42.901 --> 00:06:43.651
these containers,

270
00:06:43.651 --> 00:06:44.221
everything.

271
00:06:44.221 --> 00:06:48.000
It's all very specific cause there's a,

272
00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:50.240
an an unbelievable amount of problems.

273
00:06:50.241 --> 00:06:50.970
What's that term?

274
00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:51.803
Bespoke,

275
00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:53.560
<v 2>right?</v>

276
00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:56.160
The custom made is that what be spoke his talk?

277
00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:56.430
I,

278
00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:59.350
I believe that is [inaudible] in the last one.

279
00:06:59.360 --> 00:06:59.421
No,

280
00:06:59.421 --> 00:06:59.580
no.

281
00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:00.800
I want to learn these bowling alone.

282
00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:02.260
That's fine.

283
00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:02.471
Yeah.

284
00:07:02.471 --> 00:07:03.304
I'm pretty sport.

285
00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:04.143
That's what it means.

286
00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:04.983
Um,

287
00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:05.740
made to order.

288
00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:05.890
Yeah.

289
00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:06.460
That's what order,

290
00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:06.970
right?

291
00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:07.151
Yeah.

292
00:07:07.151 --> 00:07:11.080
So essentially these parts and components did not exist until you came along

293
00:07:11.081 --> 00:07:14.500
with designing these new devices for chambers.

294
00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:16.600
<v 1>I figured out how to get them all to work together.</v>

295
00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:17.110
Yeah.

296
00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:17.891
It's been,

297
00:07:17.891 --> 00:07:18.724
uh,

298
00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:18.971
you know,

299
00:07:18.971 --> 00:07:21.280
to get it to go on and get it off all the electrical.

300
00:07:21.281 --> 00:07:21.551
I mean,

301
00:07:21.551 --> 00:07:22.384
it's been a,

302
00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:23.081
it's been okay.

303
00:07:23.081 --> 00:07:24.070
It's been fun.

304
00:07:24.071 --> 00:07:24.904
You know,

305
00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:28.540
it's getting like to the point now to where we're glad that we finally are on

306
00:07:28.541 --> 00:07:33.541
the other side of all this stuff and that it is a valid system that the system

307
00:07:33.551 --> 00:07:34.384
now,

308
00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:35.050
uh,

309
00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:35.883
demands,

310
00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:36.970
uh,

311
00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:37.960
acknowledgement.

312
00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:40.690
We put it in there and they can't say,

313
00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:41.231
hey,

314
00:07:41.231 --> 00:07:42.310
you can't do this here.

315
00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:44.170
That's not true.

316
00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:49.060
We could put one of our devices anywhere and the authorities will allow it

317
00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:50.980
because it's done to code.

318
00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:53.920
That's why when these places they're trying to get through these trouble,

319
00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:56.510
they're looking for an exemption or a,

320
00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:57.453
uh,

321
00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:58.121
was the other word.

322
00:07:58.121 --> 00:08:02.050
They got variance these different,

323
00:08:02.051 --> 00:08:02.740
uh,

324
00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:04.210
things they try to get.

325
00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:04.900
Also,

326
00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:08.050
it's not a swimming pool so you don't have to have any code or whatever.

327
00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:12.100
These things aren't cool thing is we pools have code,

328
00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:13.023
right?

329
00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:15.820
And because this isn't a pool doesn't mean it shouldn't have code.

330
00:08:15.821 --> 00:08:19.630
That just means it should have a set of codes that are specifically designed for

331
00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:20.771
this environment,

332
00:08:20.771 --> 00:08:22.210
which is what this stuff is here.

333
00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:22.901
This,

334
00:08:22.901 --> 00:08:23.260
uh,

335
00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.150
CCS standard here that we have,

336
00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:26.110
you see it,

337
00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:31.000
it's all that stuff there that you read through this and this is the reality of

338
00:08:31.001 --> 00:08:32.980
the direction that the industry is going in.

339
00:08:32.981 --> 00:08:35.050
That the authorities are aware and,

340
00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:36.430
and then they're not stupid.

341
00:08:36.670 --> 00:08:38.440
They understand what liability is.

342
00:08:38.470 --> 00:08:38.980
They,

343
00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:39.731
they can't say,

344
00:08:39.731 --> 00:08:40.390
hey,

345
00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:40.901
go ahead.

346
00:08:40.901 --> 00:08:41.321
It's okay.

347
00:08:41.321 --> 00:08:42.154
We don't care.

348
00:08:42.210 --> 00:08:44.980
And they can't turn a blind eye on this anymore because it's

349
00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:46.800
<v 2>brought to their attention now.</v>

350
00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:46.981
Well,

351
00:08:46.981 --> 00:08:49.150
it's also been brought to their attention that there,

352
00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:52.590
there's a lot going on right now where people were being investigated for,

353
00:08:52.591 --> 00:08:54.570
for things like the doctor Oz stuff.

354
00:08:54.571 --> 00:08:57.390
We've got all weight loss shit that's out there and you know,

355
00:08:57.391 --> 00:09:01.440
all this self help industry like things along the lines of isolation tanks.

356
00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:05.040
It can be incredibly damaging if these things become as popular as you and I

357
00:09:05.041 --> 00:09:06.000
think they will be.

358
00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:09.510
And the filtration systems aren't good and people have nightmare stories.

359
00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:12.900
Exactly what actions it won't survive and survive.

360
00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:13.561
That's what happened.

361
00:09:13.561 --> 00:09:14.700
We get grossed out by it.

362
00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:15.540
Yeah.

363
00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:16.000
<v 1>Came out,</v>

364
00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.300
these things were not capable of dealing with an aids.

365
00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:20.170
Even these,

366
00:09:20.170 --> 00:09:20.500
these,

367
00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:21.333
uh,

368
00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:22.000
uh,

369
00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.520
parasites like cryptosporidium that,

370
00:09:24.610 --> 00:09:28.260
that it'll take 10 days and chlorine to deactivate a Giardia.

371
00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:28.651
That's,

372
00:09:28.651 --> 00:09:29.484
that's,

373
00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:30.550
you know,

374
00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:35.550
day in chlorine and bromine and these are not effective methods to deal with.

375
00:09:35.830 --> 00:09:36.161
<v 2>Well that,</v>

376
00:09:36.161 --> 00:09:38.590
and that's something that people would consider it for these tanks,

377
00:09:38.591 --> 00:09:39.191
chlorine.

378
00:09:39.191 --> 00:09:39.521
And it's,

379
00:09:39.521 --> 00:09:39.840
it's,

380
00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:40.330
it's,

381
00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:42.670
it's actually bad for your skin to sit in it like that.

382
00:09:43.090 --> 00:09:43.541
It's not,

383
00:09:43.541 --> 00:09:45.010
it's not healthy for you like the skin.

384
00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:48.190
Like when you go into a chlorinated pool and you'd go into like a public pool

385
00:09:48.191 --> 00:09:49.390
specialty that's heavily corn in,

386
00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:50.403
it hurts your eyes

387
00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:52.300
<v 1>at the end.</v>

388
00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:53.380
She was system.

389
00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:57.340
It is your breathing it and when it's breaking down and an action with this

390
00:09:57.341 --> 00:09:58.420
other materials,

391
00:09:58.780 --> 00:09:59.970
these methane's and the,

392
00:10:00.130 --> 00:10:00.491
like I said,

393
00:10:00.491 --> 00:10:04.390
it's creating a polyphony of toxic byproducts,

394
00:10:04.391 --> 00:10:05.800
then that need to be eradicated.

395
00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:06.933
You can't just keep,

396
00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:08.020
that's where you go to these places.

397
00:10:08.021 --> 00:10:08.291
They said,

398
00:10:08.291 --> 00:10:08.501
hey,

399
00:10:08.501 --> 00:10:09.940
how often are you switching that water out of there?

400
00:10:09.941 --> 00:10:10.161
I was like,

401
00:10:10.161 --> 00:10:10.451
Oh,

402
00:10:10.451 --> 00:10:13.000
you know this guy on that thing with the Hamilton said,

403
00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:13.391
oh,

404
00:10:13.391 --> 00:10:14.850
every four months and you're going,

405
00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:15.400
huh?

406
00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:19.150
So today you're going to take h he says it's expensive,

407
00:10:19.151 --> 00:10:19.721
don't want to do it.

408
00:10:19.721 --> 00:10:20.270
It's expensive.

409
00:10:20.270 --> 00:10:23.350
So today you take $800 a year money and throw it down the drain.

410
00:10:23.351 --> 00:10:27.610
But yesterday it was just fine to charge somebody come in here and stew around

411
00:10:27.611 --> 00:10:28.301
in that stuff.

412
00:10:28.301 --> 00:10:30.250
And I mean it isn't right.

413
00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:33.460
You mean it should be a regulatory agency that demands,

414
00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:34.370
you know,

415
00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:35.770
certain level of a,

416
00:10:35.771 --> 00:10:36.520
of cleanliness.

417
00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:36.880
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

418
00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:37.401
absolutely.

419
00:10:37.401 --> 00:10:37.701
Yeah.

420
00:10:37.701 --> 00:10:38.630
I mean it's important.

421
00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:39.051
Well,

422
00:10:39.051 --> 00:10:40.680
it's important too that there's,

423
00:10:40.690 --> 00:10:44.360
there's ways that people can avoid the negative aspects entirely.

424
00:10:44.450 --> 00:10:45.171
Figure that out,

425
00:10:45.171 --> 00:10:45.591
do it,

426
00:10:45.591 --> 00:10:47.840
and don't have fast that don't put people at risk.

427
00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:50.240
But as I said before was we were talking about before,

428
00:10:50.241 --> 00:10:51.650
this is one of the things that I wanted to get into.

429
00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:52.250
Um,

430
00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:54.260
what about like a commercial version of it,

431
00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:56.930
a non commercial version of a home version of it.

432
00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:58.580
A version where you know,

433
00:10:58.581 --> 00:10:59.960
that's just going to be you using it.

434
00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:01.760
You know that you're not going to do anything stupid.

435
00:11:01.761 --> 00:11:03.500
You're going to have to take a shower before you go in.

436
00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:04.820
You're not gonna urinate in it.

437
00:11:04.821 --> 00:11:05.360
You're not going to,

438
00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:06.193
it's only yours.

439
00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:09.380
Like you wouldn't need all that other extra jazz if it was only yours.

440
00:11:09.381 --> 00:11:10.150
Correct.

441
00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:10.750
<v 1>Well,</v>

442
00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:15.750
W W we would want to do is make sure that whatever we build is built to code.

443
00:11:17.050 --> 00:11:19.510
We don't want to put stuff into circulation.

444
00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:23.620
That's not code where the signage didn't happen to somebody.

445
00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:25.150
Liability issues.

446
00:11:25.151 --> 00:11:25.984
Like if they,

447
00:11:26.050 --> 00:11:30.820
if we cheaped out on something and it made it and then they would,

448
00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:31.770
you know,

449
00:11:31.770 --> 00:11:31.921
<v 2>okay.</v>

450
00:11:31.921 --> 00:11:32.460
But listen,

451
00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:33.031
hold on a second.

452
00:11:33.031 --> 00:11:34.200
You're saying cheaped out,

453
00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:36.180
but I don't necessarily think it's cheaping out.

454
00:11:36.181 --> 00:11:39.510
It's only cheaping out if you don't know what's going to into that water.

455
00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:42.210
If you know what's going into that water because it's only yours.

456
00:11:42.211 --> 00:11:43.320
It's not cheaping out at all.

457
00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:44.070
It's like,

458
00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:46.410
do you need to overburden your system?

459
00:11:46.411 --> 00:11:49.080
Do you need to make it so it's unbelievably stringent?

460
00:11:49.081 --> 00:11:50.160
It removes all the path.

461
00:11:50.170 --> 00:11:50.521
Just no,

462
00:11:50.521 --> 00:11:50.970
you're not.

463
00:11:50.970 --> 00:11:51.661
No one's going in there,

464
00:11:51.661 --> 00:11:52.230
but you.

465
00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:52.430
Yeah.

466
00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:53.263
If it's just,

467
00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:57.910
don't you think that that would be that not only that'd be totally acceptable.

468
00:11:57.911 --> 00:12:01.060
It would be ethical as long as you tell the people what to do.

469
00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:01.751
<v 1>Well,</v>

470
00:12:01.751 --> 00:12:02.740
I could agree with that.

471
00:12:03.130 --> 00:12:03.700
You know the,

472
00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:04.091
the,

473
00:12:04.091 --> 00:12:05.290
the issue is with us though,

474
00:12:05.291 --> 00:12:06.190
is that people,

475
00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:07.430
they're there,

476
00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:08.440
they're going to take that,

477
00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:12.610
that that system that we said just for your home and they're going to put it

478
00:12:12.611 --> 00:12:14.110
into a commercial space.

479
00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:14.610
Right.

480
00:12:14.610 --> 00:12:19.610
But once that these laws and all of these standards are put into place,

481
00:12:20.171 --> 00:12:22.870
then certainly then we might be interested in saying,

482
00:12:22.871 --> 00:12:23.141
okay,

483
00:12:23.141 --> 00:12:25.090
now here's how it could be done.

484
00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:27.700
That that would be less,

485
00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:28.510
uh,

486
00:12:28.510 --> 00:12:31.780
effective say then the commercial version.

487
00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:33.930
But first we would have first,

488
00:12:33.931 --> 00:12:34.450
what we're,

489
00:12:34.450 --> 00:12:39.450
we're very diligent about is to establish these guidelines in the beginning.

490
00:12:39.671 --> 00:12:40.090
Not just say,

491
00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:41.590
oh well yeah,

492
00:12:42.190 --> 00:12:43.930
some of our stuff does this or that.

493
00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:45.400
It's like all of it does,

494
00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:46.750
it's certified.

495
00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:47.713
It's,

496
00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:49.600
it's perfect as it is now.

497
00:12:49.601 --> 00:12:51.130
But the rest of it is like,

498
00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:51.880
okay,

499
00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:53.110
we could do that,

500
00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:54.370
but it wouldn't be,

501
00:12:54.670 --> 00:12:58.000
you know what it is that we've taken so much time and effort to,

502
00:12:58.410 --> 00:12:58.991
to get,

503
00:12:58.991 --> 00:13:02.290
right now we know all the other components,

504
00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:03.760
the less expensive ones,

505
00:13:03.761 --> 00:13:04.350
let's say.

506
00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:04.660
Right.

507
00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:05.620
And we could do that.

508
00:13:05.710 --> 00:13:05.921
<v 2>Right.</v>

509
00:13:05.921 --> 00:13:09.040
But what I'm saying is the only reason why you need all those expensive

510
00:13:09.041 --> 00:13:11.440
components cause you're dealing with more than one human being.

511
00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:12.250
Right.

512
00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:13.031
<v 1>If it's me,</v>

513
00:13:13.031 --> 00:13:14.440
that's the one human being,

514
00:13:14.441 --> 00:13:14.801
I'm,

515
00:13:14.801 --> 00:13:18.730
I'm completely okay with taking super clean actions on it.

516
00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:19.141
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

517
00:13:19.141 --> 00:13:19.480
me too.

518
00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:20.300
Wouldn't that be like,

519
00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:20.960
um,

520
00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:22.010
I like to have the best.

521
00:13:22.070 --> 00:13:22.251
Yeah,

522
00:13:22.251 --> 00:13:22.611
I know.

523
00:13:22.611 --> 00:13:24.260
But for someone who lives,

524
00:13:24.290 --> 00:13:24.721
you know,

525
00:13:24.721 --> 00:13:24.910
in a,

526
00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:28.220
in a modest way and can't afford to spend a massive amount,

527
00:13:28.221 --> 00:13:28.791
is there a way,

528
00:13:28.791 --> 00:13:29.000
like,

529
00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.040
I know that there's this new thing that they're coming out with intent.

530
00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:31.431
Yeah.

531
00:13:31.431 --> 00:13:32.264
What do you think of that?

532
00:13:32.490 --> 00:13:32.911
<v 1>Well,</v>

533
00:13:32.911 --> 00:13:34.290
it's a shower curtain on a,

534
00:13:34.291 --> 00:13:35.700
on an aluminum frame,

535
00:13:35.701 --> 00:13:35.940
you know,

536
00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:36.291
which is,

537
00:13:36.291 --> 00:13:37.124
uh,

538
00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:37.680
you know,

539
00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:40.800
I don't know how they're going to keep that stuff from a hardening up.

540
00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:42.600
There's a lot of things I don't know about.

541
00:13:42.601 --> 00:13:42.831
I know,

542
00:13:42.831 --> 00:13:44.910
and I don't want to salt in the water.

543
00:13:45.330 --> 00:13:45.720
Yeah.

544
00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:46.170
Right.

545
00:13:46.170 --> 00:13:46.561
And now the,

546
00:13:46.561 --> 00:13:50.250
I don't know how they're going to keep that somewhere without getting a hard,

547
00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:53.310
I don't know how it's not going to dissipate out of there,

548
00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:53.581
you know,

549
00:13:53.581 --> 00:13:55.200
I haven't really studied into it,

550
00:13:55.201 --> 00:13:59.670
but I'm aware of certain limitations that occur just in general when you're

551
00:13:59.671 --> 00:14:00.930
dealing with this material.

552
00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:01.531
<v 2>Right.</v>

553
00:14:01.531 --> 00:14:05.190
And do you think that perhaps some of these other designs are made from people

554
00:14:05.191 --> 00:14:07.830
that do not have a long term history,

555
00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:10.950
a long time history in this sort of a business?

556
00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:13.440
Like they don't understand exactly what's involved.

557
00:14:13.441 --> 00:14:14.790
What the like I remember,

558
00:14:14.791 --> 00:14:15.420
uh,

559
00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:16.141
the thing about,

560
00:14:16.141 --> 00:14:16.291
uh,

561
00:14:16.291 --> 00:14:17.520
the dude who worked for somebody,

562
00:14:17.521 --> 00:14:21.390
he had encountered all the bullshit before he knew about when engine seized up.

563
00:14:21.391 --> 00:14:25.000
He knew the salt content was too high and it would fuck with the spa engines you

564
00:14:25.001 --> 00:14:25.530
were placed.

565
00:14:25.530 --> 00:14:26.100
He knew,

566
00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:27.540
he knew in advance what it was.

567
00:14:27.541 --> 00:14:30.930
Probably when we talked on the phone what the issues were and he would come home

568
00:14:30.931 --> 00:14:31.441
and fix them.

569
00:14:31.441 --> 00:14:32.580
So you think a lot of these folks,

570
00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:35.220
they just sort of getting into tanks now and then they go,

571
00:14:35.221 --> 00:14:35.461
hey,

572
00:14:35.461 --> 00:14:36.240
I've got an idea.

573
00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:41.160
But they're not foreseeing the potential hazards or issues that would come from

574
00:14:41.161 --> 00:14:41.994
these things.

575
00:14:42.570 --> 00:14:43.403
Yes,

576
00:14:44.050 --> 00:14:44.883
exactly.

577
00:14:45.340 --> 00:14:46.173
<v 1>Good explanation.</v>

578
00:14:46.270 --> 00:14:46.960
That's a,

579
00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:47.793
this,

580
00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:49.400
I don't think that they care.

581
00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:50.870
They're the ones that I'm aware of.

582
00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:51.651
Some of these guys.

583
00:14:51.651 --> 00:14:52.070
I don't

584
00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:52.440
<v 3>know.</v>

585
00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:52.760
I know,

586
00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:53.420
cause I,

587
00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:54.253
I try not to,

588
00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:54.620
to,

589
00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:54.980
to,

590
00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:55.380
to,

591
00:14:55.380 --> 00:14:58.580
to get involved with these people because we're on our own page.

592
00:14:58.581 --> 00:15:00.520
We are trying to get,

593
00:15:00.590 --> 00:15:00.951
we're not,

594
00:15:00.951 --> 00:15:01.491
we're not trying,

595
00:15:01.491 --> 00:15:02.140
we're doing it.

596
00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:02.291
We,

597
00:15:02.291 --> 00:15:02.541
we,

598
00:15:02.541 --> 00:15:02.790
we,

599
00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:05.240
we were moving forward in a,

600
00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:06.470
in a direction.

601
00:15:06.770 --> 00:15:07.461
I understand what I mean.

602
00:15:07.461 --> 00:15:10.010
You're aware of these all these little companies that are coming up.

603
00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:14.960
And the good thing is that it's making people aware of tanks like a Kickstarter.

604
00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:15.531
You know,

605
00:15:15.531 --> 00:15:17.030
somebody sent me a Kickstarter for that,

606
00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:18.320
that Zen tank thing,

607
00:15:18.321 --> 00:15:19.430
and I looked at and I was like,

608
00:15:19.890 --> 00:15:21.620
I don't know if I can retweet this.

609
00:15:21.621 --> 00:15:22.610
I don't know enough about it.

610
00:15:22.611 --> 00:15:23.720
I don't know if it's good enough.

611
00:15:23.721 --> 00:15:24.554
It's bad.

612
00:15:24.650 --> 00:15:25.940
I don't know if it's a good idea.

613
00:15:26.030 --> 00:15:27.260
Maybe on that Google,

614
00:15:27.261 --> 00:15:31.770
on your computer when you have the Yahoo search motor or whatever it is there

615
00:15:31.771 --> 00:15:33.610
and say I saw it on the Yahoo,

616
00:15:33.611 --> 00:15:33.980
it said,

617
00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:34.161
oh,

618
00:15:34.161 --> 00:15:35.300
San tent or whatever.

619
00:15:35.450 --> 00:15:36.081
It's interesting.

620
00:15:36.081 --> 00:15:36.470
So it's,

621
00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:39.650
the public has a somewhat of a interest in it.

622
00:15:39.651 --> 00:15:39.951
Like I say,

623
00:15:39.951 --> 00:15:42.230
the e news is doing a,

624
00:15:42.231 --> 00:15:42.920
uh,

625
00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:44.000
uh,

626
00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:44.601
some,

627
00:15:44.601 --> 00:15:45.110
uh,

628
00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:46.040
series on,

629
00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:46.893
uh,

630
00:15:46.910 --> 00:15:50.060
actors and how they get into a peak performance or whatever it is,

631
00:15:50.061 --> 00:15:50.894
like this and that.

632
00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:52.580
And they want to include us in that,

633
00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:53.600
uh,

634
00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:56.840
in that frame of this type of activities,

635
00:15:56.841 --> 00:15:58.440
that laboratory deprivation.

636
00:15:58.460 --> 00:15:58.840
Yeah.

637
00:15:58.840 --> 00:15:59.673
You know,

638
00:15:59.990 --> 00:16:02.720
how many celebrities use semiprivate sensory deprivation tanks?

639
00:16:02.780 --> 00:16:03.590
Is there a lot?

640
00:16:03.590 --> 00:16:04.640
There was more and more.

641
00:16:04.641 --> 00:16:06.170
We have them coming in more now.

642
00:16:06.730 --> 00:16:06.980
Yeah,

643
00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:08.420
there's some that you know,

644
00:16:08.421 --> 00:16:09.051
that are very,

645
00:16:09.051 --> 00:16:09.530
uh,

646
00:16:09.530 --> 00:16:09.981
it's very,

647
00:16:09.981 --> 00:16:11.210
it's pretty cool to it,

648
00:16:11.211 --> 00:16:11.421
you know,

649
00:16:11.421 --> 00:16:13.130
and there are those good people as well.

650
00:16:13.131 --> 00:16:15.200
They're the ones that come in that are famous or whatever.

651
00:16:15.210 --> 00:16:15.800
They're,

652
00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:17.300
they're never like a big,

653
00:16:17.330 --> 00:16:17.780
uh,

654
00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:18.171
you know,

655
00:16:18.171 --> 00:16:19.640
it's me or anything like that.

656
00:16:19.641 --> 00:16:20.474
They come in low,

657
00:16:20.690 --> 00:16:21.500
you wreck,

658
00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:21.891
you know,

659
00:16:21.891 --> 00:16:22.340
uh,

660
00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:23.210
that's why I come in and dude,

661
00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:24.830
Elton John Sunglasses,

662
00:16:24.831 --> 00:16:26.060
big fucking feather hats.

663
00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:31.320
It's got to come in big [inaudible] world to the occasion where you gators

664
00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:33.833
there.

665
00:16:34.130 --> 00:16:35.330
But the people then that,

666
00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:35.780
that,

667
00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:36.320
that are,

668
00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:37.900
so what I'm saying though is it,

669
00:16:37.901 --> 00:16:40.430
it's becoming more and more of a main stream on coming,

670
00:16:40.431 --> 00:16:42.800
more and more popular and people becoming more and more aware of it.

671
00:16:42.801 --> 00:16:44.890
And I know a lot of fighters use at Diego Sanchez.

672
00:16:44.891 --> 00:16:45.740
I'm really big on it.

673
00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:47.060
Jeremy Stevens,

674
00:16:47.090 --> 00:16:48.170
who we talked about earlier,

675
00:16:48.171 --> 00:16:48.801
he loves it.

676
00:16:48.801 --> 00:16:50.870
There's a lot of fighters that come in and not,

677
00:16:50.871 --> 00:16:51.950
it was a very close fight,

678
00:16:51.951 --> 00:16:52.784
but he did not win.

679
00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:53.541
But it was,

680
00:16:53.541 --> 00:16:54.140
uh,

681
00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:55.730
it was very close and it was very good.

682
00:16:55.731 --> 00:16:56.660
It was an excellent fight.

683
00:16:56.750 --> 00:16:57.441
It was really close.

684
00:16:57.441 --> 00:16:57.981
Like at the end,

685
00:16:57.981 --> 00:17:00.710
I believe it was a split decision and at the end,

686
00:17:00.711 --> 00:17:00.980
uh,

687
00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:01.461
we were going,

688
00:17:01.461 --> 00:17:01.850
man,

689
00:17:01.850 --> 00:17:02.683
who knows.

690
00:17:02.930 --> 00:17:03.141
But,

691
00:17:03.141 --> 00:17:03.240
uh,

692
00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:03.951
I think the right guy,

693
00:17:03.951 --> 00:17:04.280
one,

694
00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:05.630
I think cubs wants him won the fight,

695
00:17:05.631 --> 00:17:05.901
but it was,

696
00:17:05.901 --> 00:17:06.291
like I said,

697
00:17:06.291 --> 00:17:06.860
it was super,

698
00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:07.640
super close.

699
00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:09.710
They both put it all in all it was great.

700
00:17:09.711 --> 00:17:10.910
It was wild fight to watch.

701
00:17:10.911 --> 00:17:15.680
These guys are so skilled that that's been about kick with a guy kicked him in

702
00:17:15.681 --> 00:17:16.370
the chin.

703
00:17:16.370 --> 00:17:20.360
I watched you walk out on a little clip and you're walking out on it.

704
00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:22.940
This is long time ago and as you're walking,

705
00:17:22.941 --> 00:17:26.240
you don't even stop walking and you jump around and kick the guy.

706
00:17:26.241 --> 00:17:29.690
I think he kicked him in the chest or something and he goes out and immediately,

707
00:17:29.691 --> 00:17:30.021
I mean,

708
00:17:30.021 --> 00:17:30.561
it was like,

709
00:17:30.561 --> 00:17:31.394
it wasn't even,

710
00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:32.930
you didn't even stop walking.

711
00:17:33.290 --> 00:17:34.370
And then that guy from,

712
00:17:34.371 --> 00:17:34.930
uh,

713
00:17:34.930 --> 00:17:35.180
what,

714
00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:35.890
what is that?

715
00:17:35.890 --> 00:17:36.500
Uh,

716
00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:38.240
there's a law and order show.

717
00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:40.760
The vault guy that's like the captain or whatever he is.

718
00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:42.860
He was telling the story about you and him.

719
00:17:42.861 --> 00:17:44.390
They are going through New York and there's these,

720
00:17:44.391 --> 00:17:44.650
uh,

721
00:17:44.650 --> 00:17:45.210
who would love this,

722
00:17:45.210 --> 00:17:45.411
right?

723
00:17:45.411 --> 00:17:47.260
It was like four or five or somebody say,

724
00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:47.761
so.

725
00:17:47.761 --> 00:17:47.851
It's,

726
00:17:47.851 --> 00:17:48.530
Joe's says,

727
00:17:48.530 --> 00:17:49.380
what are you talking into?

728
00:17:49.381 --> 00:17:50.214
A microphone crashed.

729
00:17:51.090 --> 00:17:52.570
<v 2>Sorry about that Charles.</v>

730
00:17:52.650 --> 00:17:53.160
Uh,

731
00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:54.240
Joe says to him,

732
00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:54.720
I forgot it.

733
00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:55.411
Do you know what the guy is?

734
00:17:55.411 --> 00:17:56.550
The bald law and order guy.

735
00:17:56.730 --> 00:17:57.870
He's like the in floor.

736
00:17:57.990 --> 00:17:58.590
Yeah.

737
00:17:58.590 --> 00:18:01.710
Said he said that you guys were there and Joe looks over and he says,

738
00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:02.041
Hey,

739
00:18:02.041 --> 00:18:02.250
can,

740
00:18:02.250 --> 00:18:03.960
can you take one of these guys?

741
00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:04.560
And he goes,

742
00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:04.691
oh,

743
00:18:04.691 --> 00:18:04.930
okay.

744
00:18:04.930 --> 00:18:06.840
I'm sorry Joe jumped up.

745
00:18:07.210 --> 00:18:10.020
And this never happens in New York.

746
00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:11.250
I didn't knock anybody out.

747
00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:14.970
This is a completely fabricated story and you are in New York.

748
00:18:14.971 --> 00:18:17.850
There's some who'd love to get your name because you talking about me,

749
00:18:17.970 --> 00:18:19.770
I'm trying to happen.

750
00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:20.840
Did Not happen.

751
00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:21.693
Never happened.

752
00:18:21.810 --> 00:18:22.111
See,

753
00:18:22.111 --> 00:18:25.410
this is the story he told me was he was,

754
00:18:25.411 --> 00:18:27.030
cause he might've been on pain pills.

755
00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:28.530
Are you sure it's the right guy on Ambien?

756
00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:29.410
I don't know if it's the right,

757
00:18:29.411 --> 00:18:30.690
but you just never had a problem.

758
00:18:30.690 --> 00:18:30.900
Like,

759
00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:32.760
I did not beat up anybody in New York.

760
00:18:32.790 --> 00:18:33.970
Never kicked a guy down.

761
00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:34.400
The,

762
00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:35.220
the ones ran off.

763
00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:36.810
I haven't been told me,

764
00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:37.381
no,

765
00:18:37.381 --> 00:18:39.840
I haven't been in any sort of a physical altercation.

766
00:18:39.841 --> 00:18:40.890
So I was in high school.

767
00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:41.550
Really?

768
00:18:41.550 --> 00:18:42.120
Yeah.

769
00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:42.781
You never did.

770
00:18:42.781 --> 00:18:44.910
You never have to get into a situation with some guy.

771
00:18:44.911 --> 00:18:47.200
Get him to lippy mouth and you've got to put them up there.

772
00:18:47.201 --> 00:18:49.170
A guy on fear factor that I had it grab.

773
00:18:49.290 --> 00:18:50.610
But once I grabbed him,

774
00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:53.430
shut up and I just grabbed him and held on to him,

775
00:18:53.910 --> 00:18:54.743
grabbed his neck,

776
00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:56.550
but he thought it might hurt him.

777
00:18:56.690 --> 00:18:57.030
I just,

778
00:18:57.030 --> 00:18:58.050
he was just too dangerous.

779
00:18:58.230 --> 00:19:01.380
He had hit some people before he had thrown his wife down on a television show

780
00:19:01.381 --> 00:19:04.560
and he had attacked a counselor on another television show and we,

781
00:19:04.561 --> 00:19:06.810
they had warned us before he came on the show that he was like,

782
00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:07.800
he was very,

783
00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:10.440
he was a contestant background.

784
00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:12.330
He was a celebrity.

785
00:19:12.390 --> 00:19:12.990
Um,

786
00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:13.821
one of those realities,

787
00:19:13.821 --> 00:19:14.654
celebrities,

788
00:19:14.790 --> 00:19:16.350
he had been on a reality show with his wife.

789
00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:16.471
Oh,

790
00:19:16.471 --> 00:19:17.304
this is the new one.

791
00:19:17.610 --> 00:19:18.690
It was an old fear factor.

792
00:19:18.750 --> 00:19:20.250
Was it the head reality shows back then?

793
00:19:20.430 --> 00:19:20.731
Oh yeah,

794
00:19:20.731 --> 00:19:21.390
man,

795
00:19:21.390 --> 00:19:21.721
sure.

796
00:19:21.721 --> 00:19:26.721
They had survivorman started in 2000 I want to say like 2001 or survivor did

797
00:19:27.991 --> 00:19:31.350
rather 2001 and this guy was on the amazing race,

798
00:19:31.351 --> 00:19:34.650
which I think was like 2004 or three or something like that.

799
00:19:34.830 --> 00:19:35.071
Yeah.

800
00:19:35.071 --> 00:19:36.600
I mean they've had those for a long time.

801
00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:37.201
Grabbed them,

802
00:19:37.201 --> 00:19:38.310
just get them just to chill.

803
00:19:38.790 --> 00:19:39.571
I thought it was going to hit me.

804
00:19:39.571 --> 00:19:40.560
He kept getting in my face.

805
00:19:40.561 --> 00:19:41.221
I pushed him away.

806
00:19:41.221 --> 00:19:42.001
He got my face again.

807
00:19:42.001 --> 00:19:42.300
I was like,

808
00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:42.871
I'm not going to let,

809
00:19:42.871 --> 00:19:46.560
the problem with someone hitting you is it's really hard to see.

810
00:19:46.561 --> 00:19:47.311
They're going to hit you.

811
00:19:47.311 --> 00:19:49.560
If they sucker punch you by the time you react,

812
00:19:49.561 --> 00:19:50.394
you've already been hit.

813
00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:51.240
You know,

814
00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:56.100
it's the reaction times that people have are way slower than action times action

815
00:19:56.101 --> 00:19:57.180
times are way faster.

816
00:19:57.420 --> 00:19:59.700
So if someone decides to hit you and you don't see a comment,

817
00:19:59.730 --> 00:20:00.780
it can be very dangerous.

818
00:20:01.050 --> 00:20:03.230
And when someone keeps invading your space and they're,

819
00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:04.440
they're not listening,

820
00:20:04.710 --> 00:20:05.543
they're violent,

821
00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:06.481
they're angry,

822
00:20:06.481 --> 00:20:07.950
they're spitting your face or screaming.

823
00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:10.230
If you just let a guy hit you,

824
00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:10.651
you know,

825
00:20:10.651 --> 00:20:13.770
the first punch is one of the most important aspects of any sort of an

826
00:20:13.771 --> 00:20:14.604
altercation.

827
00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:15.480
You get hit,

828
00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:16.313
you get hurt,

829
00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:17.310
damaged,

830
00:20:17.310 --> 00:20:18.510
and then someone could fuck you up.

831
00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:18.841
You know,

832
00:20:18.841 --> 00:20:20.510
you've gotta be really careful trying to regroup.

833
00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:20.790
Yeah,

834
00:20:20.790 --> 00:20:21.623
so when someone,

835
00:20:21.750 --> 00:20:24.960
these violating all the laws of engagement and he's also,

836
00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:26.850
he's showing himself to be very,

837
00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:30.210
very dumb about physical altercation because he keeps coming forward.

838
00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:32.700
I pushed him away from me and he keeps coming forward again,

839
00:20:32.701 --> 00:20:34.710
like something's going to happen.

840
00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:37.080
If you keep doing this and you're not thinking about it,

841
00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:38.820
you're not thinking about what the repercussions are.

842
00:20:38.821 --> 00:20:40.650
You don't even know how to fight and yet you still,

843
00:20:40.830 --> 00:20:42.930
you already towards them.

844
00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:46.770
But not just that I'm looking at is physical frame.

845
00:20:46.771 --> 00:20:47.050
I'm like,

846
00:20:47.050 --> 00:20:47.570
he's just,

847
00:20:47.570 --> 00:20:48.640
he's frail.

848
00:20:48.670 --> 00:20:50.890
There's nothing there that's like dangerous.

849
00:20:50.891 --> 00:20:53.020
There's no explosive movement.

850
00:20:53.050 --> 00:20:53.351
He's,

851
00:20:53.351 --> 00:20:54.460
he's spitting,

852
00:20:54.461 --> 00:20:55.091
he's yelling,

853
00:20:55.091 --> 00:20:55.811
he's red in the face.

854
00:20:55.811 --> 00:20:56.680
It's all emotional.

855
00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:58.420
It's got to run out of gas and five seconds.

856
00:20:58.421 --> 00:20:59.254
If I grab him,

857
00:20:59.260 --> 00:21:00.490
I'm just thinking all these things like,

858
00:21:00.491 --> 00:21:01.450
but I don't want him to hit me.

859
00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:02.860
That's the only one time though.

860
00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:04.840
That's the only on time on television.

861
00:21:04.841 --> 00:21:07.570
I mean I've gotten in arguments with people before,

862
00:21:07.571 --> 00:21:08.830
but I'm a nice person man.

863
00:21:09.130 --> 00:21:11.410
For the most part I can avoid most bullshit,

864
00:21:11.411 --> 00:21:13.030
but I didn't kick anybody in New York.

865
00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:14.213
I think he said,

866
00:21:14.250 --> 00:21:16.390
he said there's the other ones ran off.

867
00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:18.160
You asked him if he could handle one of them.

868
00:21:18.350 --> 00:21:18.731
He said,

869
00:21:18.731 --> 00:21:19.250
yeah,

870
00:21:19.250 --> 00:21:20.190
I don't know what to [inaudible].

871
00:21:20.270 --> 00:21:21.610
I don't know what to say.

872
00:21:21.670 --> 00:21:22.030
Oh,

873
00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:23.140
I don't know what you remember.

874
00:21:23.141 --> 00:21:24.670
I Dunno who was on Ambien.

875
00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:26.800
I Dunno who is a third.

876
00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:28.630
I don't know neither to be honest with you.

877
00:21:28.631 --> 00:21:29.020
But yeah,

878
00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:32.020
I wouldn't do that thought about though is that a lot of these people,

879
00:21:32.021 --> 00:21:32.854
I think that,

880
00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:33.430
you know,

881
00:21:33.430 --> 00:21:36.340
once you stand up they take the scatter off,

882
00:21:36.670 --> 00:21:38.730
sometimes choke on the guys contact.

883
00:21:38.830 --> 00:21:39.760
That will usually stop.

884
00:21:40.510 --> 00:21:44.830
You should always avoid altercation if you can do it.

885
00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:46.360
Any physical altercation,

886
00:21:46.390 --> 00:21:47.260
if you can avoid it,

887
00:21:47.261 --> 00:21:48.094
please do.

888
00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:49.570
You're always better off people.

889
00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:50.680
Cooler heads prevail.

890
00:21:50.681 --> 00:21:51.440
People relax,

891
00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:52.273
they calm down,

892
00:21:52.330 --> 00:21:55.210
they calmed down and get over a situation that could have resulted in a murder.

893
00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:58.540
I mean that happens all the time where it's just like people escalate and to get

894
00:21:58.541 --> 00:22:01.550
to this point and they make irrational decisions and they're super violent and

895
00:22:01.551 --> 00:22:02.770
then they go and do something really dumb.

896
00:22:03.450 --> 00:22:03.641
You know,

897
00:22:03.641 --> 00:22:04.510
it happens all the time.

898
00:22:04.511 --> 00:22:04.991
People,

899
00:22:04.991 --> 00:22:06.940
they get caught up in their emotions,

900
00:22:06.941 --> 00:22:08.250
they get caught up in their anger,

901
00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:13.260
they get caught up in their primal chimpanzee rage and they just fuck up and

902
00:22:14.591 --> 00:22:15.640
they do something terrible.

903
00:22:15.641 --> 00:22:18.430
That's why how people who love each other wind up killing each other.

904
00:22:18.620 --> 00:22:18.791
I mean,

905
00:22:18.791 --> 00:22:19.130
where,

906
00:22:19.130 --> 00:22:20.590
how could that even be rational?

907
00:22:20.591 --> 00:22:23.020
How could you ever kill someone that you used to love?

908
00:22:23.410 --> 00:22:27.190
And it all boils down to some of the same issues that we were talking about

909
00:22:27.191 --> 00:22:27.700
earlier.

910
00:22:27.700 --> 00:22:29.080
People don't have releases.

911
00:22:29.230 --> 00:22:31.030
They don't have a release for their aggression.

912
00:22:31.031 --> 00:22:32.800
They don't have a release for their frustration.

913
00:22:32.980 --> 00:22:36.490
They don't have a release for the energy that their body continues to make.

914
00:22:36.790 --> 00:22:38.560
They have all this food they're taking in their body,

915
00:22:38.561 --> 00:22:41.770
their body's getting fat because they're not exercising it.

916
00:22:41.771 --> 00:22:45.850
So this is all these imbalances and everybody's uncomfortable and people were

917
00:22:45.851 --> 00:22:46.451
agitated,

918
00:22:46.451 --> 00:22:48.370
they're agitated and easily irritated.

919
00:22:48.370 --> 00:22:53.260
And is all about personal maintenance and it's all an issue of personal

920
00:22:53.261 --> 00:22:54.010
maintenance,

921
00:22:54.010 --> 00:22:57.850
whether it's by taking yoga classes or what you and I like to do by getting into

922
00:22:57.851 --> 00:23:00.030
the tank or what some folks like to do,

923
00:23:00.050 --> 00:23:01.850
they just collect to go for an evening job.

924
00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:03.620
I know a lot of people that say that they,

925
00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:04.810
they'd go for a jog,

926
00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:06.250
like Jamie's big Jogger,

927
00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:09.430
you go for a run and it clears your mind when it's over you.

928
00:23:09.431 --> 00:23:11.110
Just things that seem so important.

929
00:23:11.111 --> 00:23:13.420
20 minutes ago they don't seem that important anymore.

930
00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:16.960
An hour ago you were sweating all these different things and now you're like,

931
00:23:16.990 --> 00:23:17.311
ah,

932
00:23:17.311 --> 00:23:18.370
and the greater perspective,

933
00:23:18.371 --> 00:23:19.300
everything's going to be okay.

934
00:23:19.510 --> 00:23:24.510
I was just caught up in a wave of momentum of emotions and anxiety and

935
00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:29.620
oftentimes you can alleviate a big chunk of those just with physical exercise.

936
00:23:29.950 --> 00:23:34.900
There's like they say that physical exercise is as effective as antidepressants

937
00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:36.790
when it comes to making people feel better.

938
00:23:37.260 --> 00:23:38.080
Yes.

939
00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:41.760
That physical exercise for a lot of folks is the recipes.

940
00:23:41.950 --> 00:23:45.590
What I mean comedy writer and he comes in and he says that,

941
00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:46.040
what's

942
00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:46.873
<v 1>his name?</v>

943
00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:48.020
I don't remember his name.

944
00:23:48.021 --> 00:23:48.591
I forgot his name.

945
00:23:48.591 --> 00:23:49.520
That you want to be writer guy?

946
00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:49.851
Yeah.

947
00:23:49.851 --> 00:23:50.684
He's calling me right back.

948
00:23:50.690 --> 00:23:51.830
He goes for a walk though.

949
00:23:51.831 --> 00:23:52.940
He doesn't even know run.

950
00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:54.560
He says he runs,

951
00:23:54.830 --> 00:23:56.300
he doesn't even like to run.

952
00:23:56.570 --> 00:23:58.370
But when he goes out and he runs,

953
00:23:58.580 --> 00:23:59.570
it creates a,

954
00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:00.433
uh,

955
00:24:00.620 --> 00:24:03.290
a mental framework that he uses to write with.

956
00:24:03.310 --> 00:24:03.690
Yes.

957
00:24:03.690 --> 00:24:08.690
So he'll go out and just go for a run to create the mental mind frame that he's

958
00:24:09.201 --> 00:24:11.990
going to work off of is a material with,

959
00:24:12.110 --> 00:24:12.590
yeah.

960
00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:13.940
Not to get the physical,

961
00:24:13.941 --> 00:24:14.420
uh,

962
00:24:14.420 --> 00:24:15.020
benefits.

963
00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:15.853
Right.

964
00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:17.061
I thought,

965
00:24:17.061 --> 00:24:17.301
whoa.

966
00:24:17.301 --> 00:24:18.840
That's a interesting,

967
00:24:18.841 --> 00:24:19.370
uh,

968
00:24:19.370 --> 00:24:21.140
because I know sometimes I'll riding my bike,

969
00:24:21.770 --> 00:24:24.190
some stuff comes into my head that I would,

970
00:24:24.350 --> 00:24:25.190
oh wow.

971
00:24:25.790 --> 00:24:27.140
I didn't think about that.

972
00:24:27.141 --> 00:24:27.910
You know,

973
00:24:27.910 --> 00:24:28.850
so I guess when you're in this,

974
00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:29.600
you know,

975
00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:31.190
exercising mode too,

976
00:24:31.790 --> 00:24:32.001
your,

977
00:24:32.001 --> 00:24:32.271
your,

978
00:24:32.271 --> 00:24:34.340
your physical stuff is taken care of.

979
00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:34.611
<v 2>Well,</v>

980
00:24:34.611 --> 00:24:35.001
sure.

981
00:24:35.001 --> 00:24:35.571
You're also,

982
00:24:35.571 --> 00:24:37.910
you're pumping your body filled with blood.

983
00:24:37.911 --> 00:24:40.370
You're accelerating all your processes.

984
00:24:40.371 --> 00:24:42.020
You're getting all your hormones going,

985
00:24:42.230 --> 00:24:43.940
you're getting all your endorphins going.

986
00:24:44.090 --> 00:24:45.110
Your body's pumping,

987
00:24:45.230 --> 00:24:45.411
you know,

988
00:24:45.411 --> 00:24:46.790
you're flushing out your system.

989
00:24:46.791 --> 00:24:47.511
Everything's moving.

990
00:24:47.511 --> 00:24:48.344
You're sweating.

991
00:24:48.420 --> 00:24:50.450
So you're sweating toxins out of your system.

992
00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:50.991
Allegedly.

993
00:24:50.991 --> 00:24:52.970
I don't like when people talk about that because usually they don't know what

994
00:24:52.971 --> 00:24:55.400
the fuck they're talking about and I'm getting rid of all the toxins.

995
00:24:55.401 --> 00:24:56.300
Are you really?

996
00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:57.380
Are you just sweating?

997
00:24:57.730 --> 00:24:58.670
And now what's happening here?

998
00:24:58.730 --> 00:24:59.960
So I'm not really sure if I should say that,

999
00:25:00.290 --> 00:25:01.580
but that's a lot of it.

1000
00:25:01.610 --> 00:25:02.061
It's a,

1001
00:25:02.061 --> 00:25:02.570
you know,

1002
00:25:02.570 --> 00:25:04.040
it's a exercise

1003
00:25:04.580 --> 00:25:06.050
<v 1>that allows the mind to,</v>

1004
00:25:06.060 --> 00:25:06.830
uh,

1005
00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:10.790
release a little bit or at least come down perhaps when it's full.

1006
00:25:10.910 --> 00:25:11.631
The physical,

1007
00:25:11.631 --> 00:25:12.250
uh,

1008
00:25:12.250 --> 00:25:13.083
uh,

1009
00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:17.520
situation is requiring more of you then,

1010
00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:21.620
and then your mind is like freed up from creating problems too.

1011
00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:24.550
<v 2>It's the battery thing we were talking about earlier too.</v>

1012
00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:25.201
It's the,

1013
00:25:25.201 --> 00:25:28.090
your body stores up all this energy and you don't have a release.

1014
00:25:28.150 --> 00:25:32.710
Some folks never have and any sort of an explosive release like months,

1015
00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:33.633
weeks,

1016
00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:34.810
days,

1017
00:25:34.810 --> 00:25:35.530
there's nothing,

1018
00:25:35.530 --> 00:25:36.341
it never happens.

1019
00:25:36.341 --> 00:25:36.941
They have no,

1020
00:25:36.941 --> 00:25:37.451
no release.

1021
00:25:37.451 --> 00:25:39.280
So their bodies just like Wah,

1022
00:25:39.730 --> 00:25:40.001
you know,

1023
00:25:40.001 --> 00:25:43.420
it's designed for all these different things that doesn't get used for.

1024
00:25:43.421 --> 00:25:46.420
It's designed so that you can do manual labor.

1025
00:25:46.421 --> 00:25:50.440
It's designed so that you could hunt for food so that you could gather and farm.

1026
00:25:50.620 --> 00:25:54.520
It's designed to be sturdy when required to be and when you don't require it to

1027
00:25:54.521 --> 00:25:54.791
be,

1028
00:25:54.791 --> 00:25:55.990
it gets uncomfortable.

1029
00:25:56.260 --> 00:25:56.561
You know?

1030
00:25:56.561 --> 00:25:57.080
And that's,

1031
00:25:57.080 --> 00:26:00.670
that's the issue that a lot of people face in this weird modern world that we've

1032
00:26:00.671 --> 00:26:02.260
created because we don't,

1033
00:26:02.620 --> 00:26:04.570
we don't give the body what it really truly needs.

1034
00:26:04.610 --> 00:26:08.370
I said Homo Stacy's thing supposed to the natural state or something like that

1035
00:26:08.371 --> 00:26:08.480
where,

1036
00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:12.550
and I think that one of the fascinating things about the tank is that it allows

1037
00:26:12.551 --> 00:26:15.160
a very unusual type of relaxation.

1038
00:26:15.430 --> 00:26:19.510
It also is an incredible way to absorb magnesium into your body like magnesium,

1039
00:26:19.511 --> 00:26:20.830
which is an important mineral.

1040
00:26:20.860 --> 00:26:23.260
It gets absorbed through your body through those salts.

1041
00:26:23.770 --> 00:26:26.290
It's like Epson salts is one of the best ways to get into your body.

1042
00:26:26.291 --> 00:26:28.540
You feel better when you lie in that thing.

1043
00:26:28.541 --> 00:26:29.650
You feel invigorated.

1044
00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:33.850
I lie in that thing for a couple of hours and I feel like I just slept like a

1045
00:26:33.851 --> 00:26:35.650
really good eight hours sleep.

1046
00:26:35.651 --> 00:26:36.484
Like Ah,

1047
00:26:37.030 --> 00:26:37.950
<v 1>such a good thing.</v>

1048
00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:39.900
So good chambers are so good.

1049
00:26:39.901 --> 00:26:42.660
That's what the people that the,

1050
00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:44.040
what's interesting is that people

1051
00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:45.600
<v 2>like it when they come in and they do it,</v>

1052
00:26:45.630 --> 00:26:45.990
they go,

1053
00:26:45.990 --> 00:26:46.171
oh,

1054
00:26:46.171 --> 00:26:46.441
you know,

1055
00:26:46.441 --> 00:26:49.620
that was a very low percentage of uh,

1056
00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:49.891
you know,

1057
00:26:49.891 --> 00:26:51.180
not that we ever ask or anything,

1058
00:26:51.181 --> 00:26:52.290
but most people say,

1059
00:26:52.291 --> 00:26:53.124
wow,

1060
00:26:54.450 --> 00:26:54.990
wow.

1061
00:26:54.990 --> 00:26:55.350
You know,

1062
00:26:55.350 --> 00:26:56.183
there is a,

1063
00:26:56.670 --> 00:26:57.900
it's such a positive,

1064
00:26:57.920 --> 00:26:58.200
uh,

1065
00:26:58.200 --> 00:26:59.400
learning and uh,

1066
00:26:59.460 --> 00:27:00.990
the downside,

1067
00:27:01.050 --> 00:27:01.501
you know,

1068
00:27:01.501 --> 00:27:02.880
I don't even know what it is.

1069
00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:03.930
I don't think there's a downside,

1070
00:27:03.931 --> 00:27:05.410
but I have had people come to me that,

1071
00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:07.440
that we're in a poorly set up tank.

1072
00:27:07.770 --> 00:27:08.341
I'm like,

1073
00:27:08.341 --> 00:27:09.440
this one guy came to me and says,

1074
00:27:09.450 --> 00:27:09.601
Hey,

1075
00:27:09.601 --> 00:27:10.291
I tried to do it,

1076
00:27:10.291 --> 00:27:11.190
but I was sweating.

1077
00:27:11.191 --> 00:27:11.550
I was like,

1078
00:27:11.550 --> 00:27:11.761
well,

1079
00:27:11.761 --> 00:27:13.200
you're in a badly set up tank.

1080
00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:14.490
You're not supposed to sweat you.

1081
00:27:14.491 --> 00:27:17.160
Almost a forced to feel slightly cool.

1082
00:27:17.190 --> 00:27:17.341
Yeah.

1083
00:27:17.341 --> 00:27:19.770
Just to get in somehow slightly cool.

1084
00:27:20.090 --> 00:27:21.360
And if you're sweating at all,

1085
00:27:21.361 --> 00:27:22.120
it's just the temperature.

1086
00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:24.360
The water's too high and that can happen.

1087
00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:25.380
It's happened to me before.

1088
00:27:25.381 --> 00:27:28.350
I've had my temperature set wrong or for whatever reason it gets warmer

1089
00:27:28.390 --> 00:27:29.223
outsides.

1090
00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:31.180
I emailed you about that recently.

1091
00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:32.113
I said,

1092
00:27:32.250 --> 00:27:33.460
leave the door open for awhile.

1093
00:27:33.490 --> 00:27:34.530
Let some of the heat out,

1094
00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:37.140
you know that number down one notch or just left it.

1095
00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:38.010
I left it.

1096
00:27:38.010 --> 00:27:38.760
Did you want us to take it?

1097
00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:38.941
Oh,

1098
00:27:38.941 --> 00:27:39.720
it's too late.

1099
00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:40.291
It doesn't matter.

1100
00:27:40.291 --> 00:27:40.861
I can do that.

1101
00:27:40.861 --> 00:27:41.694
So yeah,

1102
00:27:41.850 --> 00:27:42.990
but it's um,

1103
00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:45.000
if it's set up correctly,

1104
00:27:45.150 --> 00:27:45.631
it's a,

1105
00:27:45.631 --> 00:27:49.200
an amazing thing and it should be something that everyone,

1106
00:27:49.201 --> 00:27:53.670
at least at one point in your life recognizes or experiences because I think

1107
00:27:53.671 --> 00:27:54.504
that it's,

1108
00:27:54.620 --> 00:27:59.040
it's an alien environment that doesn't exist anywhere else in the world.

1109
00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:03.150
If you could take a pill that could give you the experience that you get when

1110
00:28:03.151 --> 00:28:04.650
you're full blown in the tank,

1111
00:28:04.651 --> 00:28:05.484
you know how that,

1112
00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:05.851
you know,

1113
00:28:05.851 --> 00:28:08.340
that feeling that you get when you're fully relaxed,

1114
00:28:08.490 --> 00:28:11.460
when you've completely let go like an hour in or something like that where

1115
00:28:11.461 --> 00:28:16.050
everything is just so chill and your mind is in this like incredible place and

1116
00:28:16.110 --> 00:28:20.190
you're essentially just breathing and floating when you hit that moment,

1117
00:28:20.191 --> 00:28:21.024
man,

1118
00:28:21.030 --> 00:28:23.400
if you could get a pill that could put people in that state,

1119
00:28:23.430 --> 00:28:24.600
it would be like ecstasy.

1120
00:28:24.870 --> 00:28:26.910
People would be like trading it in the black market.

1121
00:28:26.911 --> 00:28:27.361
They'd be like,

1122
00:28:27.361 --> 00:28:28.470
this is amazing,

1123
00:28:28.471 --> 00:28:28.921
dude.

1124
00:28:28.921 --> 00:28:31.650
The feeling that gives you like the world goes away,

1125
00:28:32.010 --> 00:28:32.251
dude,

1126
00:28:32.251 --> 00:28:33.330
you don't feel your body.

1127
00:28:33.331 --> 00:28:35.880
The world goes away and you're alone with your mind and an empty room.

1128
00:28:35.881 --> 00:28:36.241
You'd be like,

1129
00:28:36.241 --> 00:28:37.074
whoa.

1130
00:28:37.170 --> 00:28:39.580
People would freak out if it felt good.

1131
00:28:39.740 --> 00:28:40.261
It would be like,

1132
00:28:40.261 --> 00:28:41.520
that's the craziest drug ever.

1133
00:28:41.550 --> 00:28:42.160
Yeah,

1134
00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:42.421
man.

1135
00:28:42.421 --> 00:28:43.021
It's freaky,

1136
00:28:43.021 --> 00:28:43.231
Bro.

1137
00:28:43.231 --> 00:28:44.190
It's so illegal though.

1138
00:28:44.191 --> 00:28:44.881
If you get caught with it,

1139
00:28:44.881 --> 00:28:45.410
you're dead.

1140
00:28:45.410 --> 00:28:47.060
It's completely black chow forever.

1141
00:28:47.930 --> 00:28:48.910
While it lost,

1142
00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:53.100
it is like a drug in its effects,

1143
00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:55.140
but it's completely natural.

1144
00:28:55.141 --> 00:28:56.130
Completely safe.

1145
00:28:56.131 --> 00:28:56.964
Completely.

1146
00:28:57.150 --> 00:28:57.361
I mean,

1147
00:28:57.361 --> 00:29:00.300
I guess he could get addicted to it because I think a person could get pretty

1148
00:29:00.301 --> 00:29:01.290
much addicted to anything.

1149
00:29:01.291 --> 00:29:02.124
Right.

1150
00:29:02.580 --> 00:29:02.881
You know,

1151
00:29:02.881 --> 00:29:03.691
if it's worth doing,

1152
00:29:03.691 --> 00:29:04.710
it's worth overdoing

1153
00:29:06.330 --> 00:29:06.541
people.

1154
00:29:06.541 --> 00:29:07.470
Say that about jerking off.

1155
00:29:07.471 --> 00:29:08.670
Then they get blisters on their deck.

1156
00:29:08.700 --> 00:29:08.940
Yeah,

1157
00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:11.040
the locusts coming until you got to worry about the locus.

1158
00:29:11.110 --> 00:29:12.510
Then you got to worry about,

1159
00:29:12.540 --> 00:29:13.170
you know,

1160
00:29:13.170 --> 00:29:14.720
people get that way with gambling people.

1161
00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:18.090
I mean people get addicted to bunk off a lot of things that aren't physically

1162
00:29:18.091 --> 00:29:21.120
addictive as far as like the cellular level.

1163
00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:23.790
But do you get addicted to those rushes that you get?

1164
00:29:23.820 --> 00:29:24.700
You get a dictation.

1165
00:29:25.140 --> 00:29:27.060
Can we get addicted to fighting with their spouse?

1166
00:29:27.470 --> 00:29:29.100
It's a lot of people that just can't help it.

1167
00:29:29.101 --> 00:29:33.510
They have these seesaw battles within their relationships when they get mad and

1168
00:29:33.511 --> 00:29:36.480
yell at each other and then they recover and they love each other so much better

1169
00:29:36.690 --> 00:29:38.300
because of the fact that they've gone through this,

1170
00:29:38.310 --> 00:29:40.470
this almost neuro chemicals that we're at.

1171
00:29:40.490 --> 00:29:41.800
We get upset and then we got,

1172
00:29:41.801 --> 00:29:42.010
we get

1173
00:29:42.010 --> 00:29:43.000
<v 1>a hit from that.</v>

1174
00:29:43.990 --> 00:29:44.823
Interesting.

1175
00:29:44.910 --> 00:29:45.743
We get bored,

1176
00:29:45.790 --> 00:29:46.151
you know,

1177
00:29:46.151 --> 00:29:47.600
we're designed to go uh,

1178
00:29:47.810 --> 00:29:48.860
<v 2>wild through the jungle,</v>

1179
00:29:48.890 --> 00:29:50.810
banging each other like monkeys.

1180
00:29:51.470 --> 00:29:52.370
We don't do that anymore.

1181
00:29:52.371 --> 00:29:53.061
So we get bored.

1182
00:29:53.061 --> 00:29:55.580
So the way we keep it exciting is start fights

1183
00:29:57.150 --> 00:29:58.140
at all,

1184
00:29:58.190 --> 00:29:58.880
upset,

1185
00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:00.050
make up with each other.

1186
00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:06.500
This is what I love about the tank is that it gives you the chance to sort of

1187
00:30:06.501 --> 00:30:08.030
step back and see stuff like that.

1188
00:30:08.300 --> 00:30:11.900
It gives you a chance to step back and see like your whole life and to be alone

1189
00:30:11.901 --> 00:30:12.734
with your mind.

1190
00:30:12.860 --> 00:30:13.010
Oh,

1191
00:30:13.010 --> 00:30:16.250
he alone with your mind to just really get a good look at what the fuck's going

1192
00:30:16.251 --> 00:30:16.960
on.

1193
00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:18.490
<v 1>It's such a good place to go to.</v>

1194
00:30:18.780 --> 00:30:19.930
Did you beat then?

1195
00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:23.230
Cause it's like the regular world is just loaded with stuff now.

1196
00:30:23.231 --> 00:30:24.970
It's like you're constant in order,

1197
00:30:24.971 --> 00:30:26.140
just like unplugged,

1198
00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:27.490
not answer the phone or not,

1199
00:30:28.300 --> 00:30:30.250
not have anything going on at all.

1200
00:30:30.530 --> 00:30:31.750
It's so very,

1201
00:30:31.770 --> 00:30:32.530
uh,

1202
00:30:32.530 --> 00:30:33.160
complex,

1203
00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:38.160
complex to get yourself somewhere where you almost have to like leave and go on

1204
00:30:38.621 --> 00:30:40.000
a vacation or something.

1205
00:30:40.270 --> 00:30:41.650
But in there you could just,

1206
00:30:42.100 --> 00:30:46.870
you could just get in there and close the door and then take yourself out of

1207
00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:49.930
whatever it was that w w was.

1208
00:30:49.931 --> 00:30:51.520
Where do you want it to leave from?

1209
00:30:51.521 --> 00:30:51.851
You know,

1210
00:30:51.851 --> 00:30:52.684
and uh,

1211
00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:54.100
it can't come back later.

1212
00:30:54.740 --> 00:30:56.170
A better prepared to,

1213
00:30:56.171 --> 00:30:56.590
uh,

1214
00:30:56.590 --> 00:30:58.510
to deal with the situation that it might've been,

1215
00:30:58.511 --> 00:30:59.200
you know?

1216
00:30:59.200 --> 00:30:59.790
Yeah.

1217
00:30:59.790 --> 00:30:59.940
<v 2>I,</v>

1218
00:30:59.940 --> 00:31:00.691
I agree.

1219
00:31:00.691 --> 00:31:01.740
And I think it's just,

1220
00:31:01.830 --> 00:31:06.830
it's so interesting to me that this slipped through the cracks for decades.

1221
00:31:07.650 --> 00:31:12.480
That somehow or another people forgot about this and it was one of those things.

1222
00:31:12.481 --> 00:31:15.870
It was incredibly fringe when I came upon it.

1223
00:31:15.930 --> 00:31:16.231
Um,

1224
00:31:16.231 --> 00:31:18.270
I went to a place called soothing solutions.

1225
00:31:18.271 --> 00:31:20.510
It's still open in Burbank and uh,

1226
00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:23.390
they have those Samadi tanks and they do a great job taking care of them and

1227
00:31:23.391 --> 00:31:24.480
they have a shower right there.

1228
00:31:24.481 --> 00:31:25.740
They have a real good set up.

1229
00:31:25.741 --> 00:31:27.840
And The lady that ran it was super nice,

1230
00:31:27.841 --> 00:31:28.800
but she was like,

1231
00:31:29.130 --> 00:31:30.510
it was on the verge of going under.

1232
00:31:30.511 --> 00:31:32.940
Like there wasn't that many people that were using those tanks.

1233
00:31:33.090 --> 00:31:33.923
It was just,

1234
00:31:33.930 --> 00:31:35.100
it was a pretty rare,

1235
00:31:35.460 --> 00:31:37.470
it wasn't like the super popular thing.

1236
00:31:37.740 --> 00:31:39.990
And I remember the first time I did it there,

1237
00:31:39.991 --> 00:31:40.501
I was like,

1238
00:31:40.501 --> 00:31:42.270
this is fucking bananas.

1239
00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:45.840
How is this not something that everybody's talking about everywhere you go?

1240
00:31:45.841 --> 00:31:46.071
And I,

1241
00:31:46.071 --> 00:31:49.110
I questioned her about it and I questioned other people about it and then I

1242
00:31:49.111 --> 00:31:50.250
would ask people,

1243
00:31:50.251 --> 00:31:51.061
have you heard about it?

1244
00:31:51.061 --> 00:31:56.061
And I was stunned by how few people in the psychedelic community didn't do it.

1245
00:31:56.730 --> 00:31:58.290
We're going to sell thousands of them.

1246
00:31:58.680 --> 00:31:59.610
Ken has never done it.

1247
00:31:59.780 --> 00:32:00.500
<v 1>I'm getting there going,</v>

1248
00:32:00.500 --> 00:32:01.160
this is such an,

1249
00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:01.993
I don't think

1250
00:32:03.530 --> 00:32:05.180
you're going to everybody.

1251
00:32:05.390 --> 00:32:07.190
When I first did it and I started doing it going,

1252
00:32:07.340 --> 00:32:09.580
this is something that it,

1253
00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:11.720
it's Graham Hancock had never done it and I know it.

1254
00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:13.250
<v 2>He's supposed to come to my house and do it.</v>

1255
00:32:13.251 --> 00:32:14.450
I was going to send them to you to do it.

1256
00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:15.793
Next time he's in,

1257
00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:16.731
he's in America.

1258
00:32:16.731 --> 00:32:17.510
I'm fucking,

1259
00:32:17.510 --> 00:32:19.160
I'm dragging them to one of those things.

1260
00:32:19.340 --> 00:32:19.611
It's like,

1261
00:32:19.611 --> 00:32:20.870
how can you go around?

1262
00:32:21.020 --> 00:32:23.600
He traveled all the way to the jungle to do Iowasca Com.

1263
00:32:23.630 --> 00:32:24.463
It's right here.

1264
00:32:24.500 --> 00:32:25.333
Sit Down,

1265
00:32:25.380 --> 00:32:26.390
<v 1>didn't do himself really good.</v>

1266
00:32:26.460 --> 00:32:27.293
He's amazing,

1267
00:32:28.130 --> 00:32:29.540
intuitive like that.

1268
00:32:29.570 --> 00:32:30.201
He's a great,

1269
00:32:30.201 --> 00:32:31.070
great guy too.

1270
00:32:31.071 --> 00:32:35.690
Just a beautiful human being and being somebody that really has a lot,

1271
00:32:35.780 --> 00:32:36.460
a lot in him.

1272
00:32:36.460 --> 00:32:37.293
<v 2>Fascinating,</v>

1273
00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:38.080
honest,

1274
00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:40.720
inquisitive to take chances in,

1275
00:32:40.740 --> 00:32:41.840
even if he's incorrect.

1276
00:32:41.900 --> 00:32:43.820
Occasionally with some of these ideas,

1277
00:32:44.090 --> 00:32:45.590
the ones that he's been correct about,

1278
00:32:45.620 --> 00:32:46.730
it's pretty mind blowing.

1279
00:32:46.740 --> 00:32:50.360
Some of the implications of some of the things that he's discovered and what

1280
00:32:50.361 --> 00:32:50.681
things are,

1281
00:32:50.681 --> 00:32:54.020
we were talking about this on the phone or the on the car right up here that go

1282
00:32:54.021 --> 00:32:57.350
Beckley Tepi situation where they've discovered this incredible,

1283
00:32:57.570 --> 00:32:58.100
uh,

1284
00:32:58.100 --> 00:33:01.340
stone ruins from 14,000 years ago.

1285
00:33:01.341 --> 00:33:03.920
And this is something that they just didn't even know existed before.

1286
00:33:04.070 --> 00:33:07.280
They didn't know there was a culture 14,000 years ago that was capable of

1287
00:33:07.281 --> 00:33:08.390
building something like this.

1288
00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:11.510
And because of the fact that it was covered up 14,000 years ago,

1289
00:33:11.511 --> 00:33:15.380
they're pretty sure that it was built at least that long ago,

1290
00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:16.770
perhaps even longer.

1291
00:33:16.771 --> 00:33:18.060
It's covered up on purpose.

1292
00:33:18.061 --> 00:33:19.850
It was covered up on pertinent and they said,

1293
00:33:19.851 --> 00:33:21.680
I think they explained how the arc,

1294
00:33:21.681 --> 00:33:23.930
and this is all mainstream archeology folks,

1295
00:33:23.931 --> 00:33:25.500
this isn't some weird fringe shit.

1296
00:33:25.550 --> 00:33:26.301
This is a,

1297
00:33:26.301 --> 00:33:26.541
I mean,

1298
00:33:26.541 --> 00:33:31.010
pretty much completely agreed upon by all these different scientists that at

1299
00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:33.470
some point around 12,000 years ago,

1300
00:33:33.620 --> 00:33:36.380
they covered all of the stone structures.

1301
00:33:36.381 --> 00:33:38.720
And it's an enormous stone,

1302
00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:39.340
uh,

1303
00:33:39.340 --> 00:33:42.440
structure complex of these concentric circles.

1304
00:33:42.441 --> 00:33:45.770
And there's these weird three dimensional carvings that are into the stone

1305
00:33:45.771 --> 00:33:46.171
columns.

1306
00:33:46.171 --> 00:33:46.641
They're huge.

1307
00:33:46.641 --> 00:33:47.540
We're very integrated,

1308
00:33:47.690 --> 00:33:49.460
very difficult to do.

1309
00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:52.790
Especially back then when they thought that people were essentially just hunters

1310
00:33:52.791 --> 00:33:53.624
and gatherers,

1311
00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:54.081
which is,

1312
00:33:54.081 --> 00:33:54.381
you know,

1313
00:33:54.381 --> 00:33:56.510
they didn't think that people had built cities back then.

1314
00:33:56.780 --> 00:33:58.460
So 14,000 years ago,

1315
00:33:58.461 --> 00:34:00.470
someone or 12,000 plus years ago,

1316
00:34:00.620 --> 00:34:04.610
someone had had the ability to do this that we were unaware of until this

1317
00:34:04.611 --> 00:34:05.444
discovery.

1318
00:34:05.540 --> 00:34:08.930
And this discovery wasn't even made until like then I think the nineties

1319
00:34:08.930 --> 00:34:11.960
eighties or nineties someone found one of these stones and they started

1320
00:34:11.961 --> 00:34:12.794
uncovering it.

1321
00:34:12.860 --> 00:34:16.550
And to this day they've only uncovered like 5% why isn't that a focus?

1322
00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:17.061
Well,

1323
00:34:17.061 --> 00:34:17.480
it is.

1324
00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:18.670
It's just slowly but surely.

1325
00:34:18.680 --> 00:34:18.831
Well,

1326
00:34:18.831 --> 00:34:20.510
it's only 5% uncovered,

1327
00:34:20.511 --> 00:34:20.990
but it's,

1328
00:34:20.990 --> 00:34:22.070
it's a focus of us.

1329
00:34:22.071 --> 00:34:22.401
Why?

1330
00:34:22.401 --> 00:34:27.401
Why is it society like informed about Kim Kardashians acids?

1331
00:34:27.470 --> 00:34:27.831
Huge.

1332
00:34:27.831 --> 00:34:29.000
And a lot of people think it's fake.

1333
00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:30.113
That's it.

1334
00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:31.970
Her dog has got a,

1335
00:34:31.971 --> 00:34:33.290
he's got his paws.

1336
00:34:33.470 --> 00:34:34.430
Something's wrong.

1337
00:34:34.431 --> 00:34:35.540
There's something wrong with the dog.

1338
00:34:35.541 --> 00:34:36.430
What are the challenges?

1339
00:34:37.430 --> 00:34:38.030
The shoe shoe.

1340
00:34:38.030 --> 00:34:38.410
Dot.

1341
00:34:38.410 --> 00:34:39.020
Yeah.

1342
00:34:39.020 --> 00:34:39.270
Well,

1343
00:34:39.270 --> 00:34:41.720
it's mainstream television.

1344
00:34:41.721 --> 00:34:44.180
Mainstream media is a lot of is,

1345
00:34:44.181 --> 00:34:44.571
you know,

1346
00:34:44.571 --> 00:34:44.691
it's,

1347
00:34:44.691 --> 00:34:46.850
it's a business and it's based on the,

1348
00:34:46.851 --> 00:34:48.160
the base humans that,

1349
00:34:48.230 --> 00:34:49.610
the amount of numbers look,

1350
00:34:49.611 --> 00:34:54.611
I've talked to a lot of people that work for Papa razzies that work for like TMZ

1351
00:34:55.071 --> 00:34:55.840
that work for these people.

1352
00:34:55.840 --> 00:34:59.180
They're just regular people that are a part of this system that they get some

1353
00:34:59.181 --> 00:34:59.960
money out of.

1354
00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:00.431
And the,

1355
00:35:00.431 --> 00:35:03.710
the get some money out of the system exists because people are curious as to

1356
00:35:03.711 --> 00:35:04.880
what Brittany Spears is up to.

1357
00:35:05.090 --> 00:35:06.110
They're curious as to,

1358
00:35:06.390 --> 00:35:06.620
you know,

1359
00:35:06.620 --> 00:35:09.880
how Kanye West is going to deal with Jimmy Kellum making fun of them.

1360
00:35:09.881 --> 00:35:10.050
I,

1361
00:35:10.050 --> 00:35:14.600
the people just get super obsessed by this stuff and there's a business and

1362
00:35:14.601 --> 00:35:15.800
feeding that obsession.

1363
00:35:16.010 --> 00:35:21.010
So all these people that don't take themselves away from the television and

1364
00:35:21.381 --> 00:35:25.370
don't get into an isolation tank and don't take a yoga and don't consciously

1365
00:35:25.371 --> 00:35:29.150
choose to not inundate their mind with silly nonsense.

1366
00:35:29.210 --> 00:35:30.043
Instead,

1367
00:35:30.530 --> 00:35:32.230
if they just took a,

1368
00:35:32.231 --> 00:35:33.350
a broader path,

1369
00:35:33.410 --> 00:35:35.270
took a a wider view,

1370
00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:35.851
took a,

1371
00:35:35.851 --> 00:35:38.670
a more sensible to their life,

1372
00:35:39.450 --> 00:35:39.721
you know,

1373
00:35:39.721 --> 00:35:42.240
I think we would see less and less of that stuff.

1374
00:35:42.270 --> 00:35:45.510
You know it exists because there's a void because there's a reason for it

1375
00:35:45.870 --> 00:35:47.310
because it's interesting to people.

1376
00:35:47.700 --> 00:35:48.690
It could be a fad.

1377
00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:51.900
Maybe if people continue to,

1378
00:35:51.930 --> 00:35:52.200
you know,

1379
00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:56.910
get smarter along the course that we looked at earlier in the podcast,

1380
00:35:56.911 --> 00:35:57.744
the court,

1381
00:35:57.780 --> 00:35:59.730
not the courtship of Eddie's father,

1382
00:35:59.731 --> 00:36:00.564
but of um,

1383
00:36:00.570 --> 00:36:01.403
leave it to beaver.

1384
00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:01.951
We look at,

1385
00:36:01.951 --> 00:36:04.950
leave it to beaver and then look at things that we see on television today and

1386
00:36:04.951 --> 00:36:08.550
the sophistication level of the media that we produce.

1387
00:36:08.730 --> 00:36:09.001
The,

1388
00:36:09.001 --> 00:36:09.181
there,

1389
00:36:09.181 --> 00:36:11.430
the artwork that we produce is pretty intense.

1390
00:36:11.490 --> 00:36:12.810
The growth amount,

1391
00:36:12.811 --> 00:36:13.710
it's pretty intense.

1392
00:36:14.190 --> 00:36:18.870
So I think that that is just the evidence that people are becoming more

1393
00:36:18.871 --> 00:36:20.220
sophisticated overall.

1394
00:36:20.250 --> 00:36:21.810
There's still going to be plenty of idiots.

1395
00:36:22.020 --> 00:36:22.980
There always will be.

1396
00:36:23.310 --> 00:36:25.140
There's always going to be people that resist.

1397
00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:28.680
There's always going to be people that are like involved in religious cults.

1398
00:36:28.710 --> 00:36:32.790
There's going to be people that are ideologues that have these insane

1399
00:36:32.791 --> 00:36:33.630
ideologies.

1400
00:36:33.810 --> 00:36:34.740
There's always going to be that.

1401
00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:38.190
But I think that overall things are getting more sophisticated.

1402
00:36:38.191 --> 00:36:40.770
People are becoming more aware of people becoming more smart.

1403
00:36:41.550 --> 00:36:42.383
Don't you think?

1404
00:36:42.430 --> 00:36:42.880
I'm,

1405
00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:43.740
I'm hoping for that.

1406
00:36:43.741 --> 00:36:44.790
And I believe that that's,

1407
00:36:44.820 --> 00:36:46.200
that's probably correct.

1408
00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:48.390
And the tanks part of that in some what tanks

1409
00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:49.410
<v 1>can help a person.</v>

1410
00:36:49.411 --> 00:36:50.880
I mean if everybody,

1411
00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:51.331
you know,

1412
00:36:51.331 --> 00:36:51.691
and like I say,

1413
00:36:51.691 --> 00:36:52.830
they put them in these schools,

1414
00:36:52.831 --> 00:36:53.670
help these kids,

1415
00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:54.871
you know,

1416
00:36:54.871 --> 00:36:55.704
the

1417
00:36:56.970 --> 00:36:58.410
defined themselves.

1418
00:36:58.680 --> 00:36:58.921
You know,

1419
00:36:58.921 --> 00:37:02.550
that that's very important for people that to have that opportunity in that,

1420
00:37:02.551 --> 00:37:06.700
that option to take and uh,

1421
00:37:06.810 --> 00:37:10.710
turn out how they want to be based on what it is that they think that,

1422
00:37:10.770 --> 00:37:11.700
how they want to be.

1423
00:37:11.701 --> 00:37:12.061
You know what I mean?

1424
00:37:12.061 --> 00:37:15.630
He said do it because of your own reasons.

1425
00:37:16.310 --> 00:37:16.581
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1426
00:37:16.581 --> 00:37:18.020
And know what those reasons are.

1427
00:37:18.021 --> 00:37:20.000
And that's one of the things about meditation,

1428
00:37:20.180 --> 00:37:22.830
whether it's TM or whether it's yoga,

1429
00:37:22.860 --> 00:37:24.710
whether it's going into a tank.

1430
00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:27.020
When you're alone with your thoughts,

1431
00:37:27.021 --> 00:37:29.060
you get an idea of what your thoughts actually are.

1432
00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:30.110
If you live your life,

1433
00:37:30.111 --> 00:37:34.520
just act and constantly on the momentum of other people's expectations of you

1434
00:37:34.521 --> 00:37:36.530
wanting to be liked by these other people.

1435
00:37:36.680 --> 00:37:39.410
You can run into a trap and you,

1436
00:37:39.411 --> 00:37:39.760
you,

1437
00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:42.170
you set up a life that you didn't really want.

1438
00:37:42.230 --> 00:37:43.041
You're fucked.

1439
00:37:43.041 --> 00:37:43.221
You're,

1440
00:37:43.221 --> 00:37:43.580
you're,

1441
00:37:43.580 --> 00:37:46.430
you're trapped in this situation where you have a mortgage,

1442
00:37:46.820 --> 00:37:48.020
you've got credit card bills,

1443
00:37:48.021 --> 00:37:48.801
you've got student loans,

1444
00:37:48.801 --> 00:37:49.431
you have to pay,

1445
00:37:49.431 --> 00:37:50.690
you have a bunch of shit going on.

1446
00:37:50.691 --> 00:37:53.660
Do you have to continue to feed and all that.

1447
00:37:53.661 --> 00:37:55.910
And especially if you have a family and you have to feed them,

1448
00:37:55.940 --> 00:37:56.840
oh my goodness.

1449
00:37:57.040 --> 00:37:58.300
Then you are fully locked in.

1450
00:37:58.310 --> 00:37:59.990
You can't take any chances whatsoever.

1451
00:38:00.500 --> 00:38:05.500
And oftentimes people make the mistake of getting stuck and it is just a

1452
00:38:06.201 --> 00:38:07.190
tactical mistake.

1453
00:38:07.191 --> 00:38:10.820
Just like it would be a mistake if you got stuck on a video game just like it

1454
00:38:10.821 --> 00:38:14.930
would be a mistake if you followed a map incorrectly and you get stuck in the

1455
00:38:14.931 --> 00:38:15.590
woods,

1456
00:38:15.590 --> 00:38:18.200
you're life is certainly some sort of a journey.

1457
00:38:18.380 --> 00:38:21.980
It's certainly some sort of a journey and we have to all be aware that when

1458
00:38:21.981 --> 00:38:23.000
we're making journeys,

1459
00:38:23.120 --> 00:38:26.390
we're not going to always make the right steps and sometimes you have to back up

1460
00:38:26.391 --> 00:38:27.081
and try again.

1461
00:38:27.081 --> 00:38:29.570
And if you're in a position where you can't back up and try again,

1462
00:38:29.930 --> 00:38:34.930
you've trapped herself and the system will set out honeypots for to get trapped

1463
00:38:35.981 --> 00:38:39.190
in the system will set out the ideas of retirement,

1464
00:38:39.370 --> 00:38:41.980
the ideas of the golden years providing you benefits,

1465
00:38:41.981 --> 00:38:43.810
providing you a healthy work environment.

1466
00:38:43.990 --> 00:38:44.350
Why?

1467
00:38:44.350 --> 00:38:44.561
Well,

1468
00:38:44.561 --> 00:38:46.000
because they want people to work for them.

1469
00:38:46.210 --> 00:38:49.810
They don't want people to realize their own dreams and escape those.

1470
00:38:49.900 --> 00:38:51.010
That's a fucking pain in the ass.

1471
00:38:51.011 --> 00:38:54.970
You got to hire more people and train them and they want to set it up so that

1472
00:38:54.971 --> 00:38:55.804
you stick around,

1473
00:38:55.930 --> 00:38:58.090
stick around in some sort of an unsatisfying world.

1474
00:38:58.091 --> 00:39:01.060
It's up to you to see that video game problem,

1475
00:39:01.270 --> 00:39:03.550
to see that issue as it comes up on the map and know,

1476
00:39:03.551 --> 00:39:08.170
and I think this is a right turn to see all the problems that could potentially

1477
00:39:08.171 --> 00:39:10.000
lay in front of you and calculate your,

1478
00:39:10.180 --> 00:39:13.570
your future and then also look around all the people that didn't do it and look

1479
00:39:13.571 --> 00:39:16.270
at the misery that they're in and learn that you don't want to be like them.

1480
00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:20.140
And then look at the people that have kind of taken chances and navigated their

1481
00:39:20.141 --> 00:39:20.740
way.

1482
00:39:20.740 --> 00:39:22.030
What did they do differently than you?

1483
00:39:22.050 --> 00:39:22.230
When?

1484
00:39:22.230 --> 00:39:24.940
What would objectivity do they have that maybe you lack?

1485
00:39:24.941 --> 00:39:26.860
What insight into their own mistakes?

1486
00:39:26.980 --> 00:39:29.200
Are they willing to delve into that?

1487
00:39:29.201 --> 00:39:31.000
You're not that you step back and go,

1488
00:39:31.001 --> 00:39:31.211
you know,

1489
00:39:31.211 --> 00:39:31.451
I don't,

1490
00:39:31.451 --> 00:39:32.284
I just don't,

1491
00:39:32.350 --> 00:39:34.210
I just don't want to look at myself that closely.

1492
00:39:34.720 --> 00:39:37.690
But the person who's able to look at themselves the closest it's going to get

1493
00:39:37.691 --> 00:39:38.560
the more rational

1494
00:39:38.650 --> 00:39:39.483
<v 3>results.</v>

1495
00:39:40.660 --> 00:39:41.493
Well put,

1496
00:39:41.560 --> 00:39:41.980
you know,

1497
00:39:41.980 --> 00:39:43.960
cause you're your own architect,

1498
00:39:43.961 --> 00:39:44.681
you know what I mean?

1499
00:39:44.681 --> 00:39:44.910
Yeah.

1500
00:39:44.910 --> 00:39:45.743
Your turnout,

1501
00:39:46.060 --> 00:39:46.930
how you sort of,

1502
00:39:47.140 --> 00:39:48.400
I want to be like Shaquille O'Neal,

1503
00:39:48.670 --> 00:39:49.510
Shit's not going to happen.

1504
00:39:50.010 --> 00:39:50.570
You know,

1505
00:39:50.570 --> 00:39:53.380
if you want it to be like tall black guy.

1506
00:39:53.381 --> 00:39:53.740
Yeah,

1507
00:39:53.740 --> 00:39:55.540
that's really the odds are slim.

1508
00:39:56.440 --> 00:39:59.980
Can you imagine if you could imagine they found out that the secret is real,

1509
00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:02.320
that you could just become whatever you want.

1510
00:40:02.410 --> 00:40:04.930
So if you thought hard enough about being a giant,

1511
00:40:04.931 --> 00:40:05.950
you would just start growing.

1512
00:40:06.280 --> 00:40:07.960
If you thought hard enough about being a woman,

1513
00:40:07.961 --> 00:40:09.100
you would just turn into a woman.

1514
00:40:09.430 --> 00:40:10.420
Like people like look at you,

1515
00:40:10.421 --> 00:40:11.740
like is something going on crash?

1516
00:40:12.100 --> 00:40:12.700
He'd just be like,

1517
00:40:12.700 --> 00:40:13.080
AH,

1518
00:40:13.080 --> 00:40:16.150
well I've been thinking a lot about living my life as a woman,

1519
00:40:16.151 --> 00:40:19.600
so I just started to become a woman and he could just do it like from a cellular

1520
00:40:19.601 --> 00:40:22.620
level and the unconsciously totally catch us.

1521
00:40:22.630 --> 00:40:24.250
What's going on here with this?

1522
00:40:24.251 --> 00:40:25.080
That's ridiculous.

1523
00:40:25.080 --> 00:40:27.280
I'm talking about completely consciously.

1524
00:40:27.310 --> 00:40:28.590
Isn't that the idea behind like the,

1525
00:40:28.591 --> 00:40:29.424
the secret?

1526
00:40:29.710 --> 00:40:30.550
Did you get like,

1527
00:40:30.551 --> 00:40:31.060
um,

1528
00:40:31.060 --> 00:40:31.811
when that whole,

1529
00:40:31.811 --> 00:40:31.961
uh,

1530
00:40:31.961 --> 00:40:35.350
the secret thing was going on and what the bleep do we know when people started

1531
00:40:35.351 --> 00:40:38.200
really getting into the idea of manifesting your own reality with your

1532
00:40:38.201 --> 00:40:39.034
imagination,

1533
00:40:39.160 --> 00:40:42.670
did you get a lot more people coming into the tank centers looking for a place

1534
00:40:42.671 --> 00:40:46.600
to do that was probably like kind of in the people maybe started to,

1535
00:40:46.601 --> 00:40:47.434
uh,

1536
00:40:48.090 --> 00:40:48.910
that uh,

1537
00:40:48.910 --> 00:40:49.420
group,

1538
00:40:49.420 --> 00:40:50.253
uh,

1539
00:40:50.260 --> 00:40:51.093
what's it called?

1540
00:40:51.100 --> 00:40:54.190
Group consciousness or collect collective consciousness.

1541
00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:54.491
Yeah.

1542
00:40:54.491 --> 00:40:55.290
Yeah.

1543
00:40:55.290 --> 00:40:56.020
You know,

1544
00:40:56.020 --> 00:40:59.350
I don't really like that and I don't like that you Animoto stuff about the

1545
00:40:59.351 --> 00:40:59.681
water,

1546
00:40:59.681 --> 00:41:02.020
having a personality or whatever it is that bullshit.

1547
00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:04.720
I have a dark field microscope and I studied,

1548
00:41:04.750 --> 00:41:05.030
you know,

1549
00:41:05.030 --> 00:41:09.040
a bit about water and I yell at it or I'm nice to it and I can't tell the

1550
00:41:09.041 --> 00:41:09.430
difference.

1551
00:41:09.430 --> 00:41:09.551
You know,

1552
00:41:09.551 --> 00:41:10.150
I haven't tried it.

1553
00:41:10.150 --> 00:41:10.421
Yeah.

1554
00:41:10.421 --> 00:41:10.750
Yo,

1555
00:41:10.750 --> 00:41:14.530
you know you're a rotten and it doesn't seem to affect the water under my

1556
00:41:14.531 --> 00:41:15.190
microscope.

1557
00:41:15.190 --> 00:41:16.810
But he does the freezing.

1558
00:41:16.990 --> 00:41:17.790
I don't know how he did it,

1559
00:41:17.790 --> 00:41:18.101
but I said,

1560
00:41:18.101 --> 00:41:18.581
what is it called?

1561
00:41:18.581 --> 00:41:19.780
The message in the water?

1562
00:41:20.010 --> 00:41:21.130
Well it's Yamamoto.

1563
00:41:21.160 --> 00:41:22.610
He's a scientist that uh,

1564
00:41:22.690 --> 00:41:23.800
suggest that uh,

1565
00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:29.160
the water is it like we're water sort of I think as the premise premises that if

1566
00:41:29.620 --> 00:41:30.800
you're nice to water,

1567
00:41:31.010 --> 00:41:31.900
water's nice.

1568
00:41:31.901 --> 00:41:32.890
And they said if you're nice to,

1569
00:41:33.410 --> 00:41:34.160
they're nice.

1570
00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:35.270
I think it's something,

1571
00:41:35.300 --> 00:41:40.300
it's called hidden messages in water and it's all pretty fascinating.

1572
00:41:41.060 --> 00:41:44.090
But a lot of people think it's total bullshit.

1573
00:41:44.300 --> 00:41:45.350
Scientists think that.

1574
00:41:45.510 --> 00:41:46.141
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

1575
00:41:46.141 --> 00:41:47.940
but those are the ones he got to listen to van.

1576
00:41:47.941 --> 00:41:48.810
Cause all these other people,

1577
00:41:48.811 --> 00:41:50.220
they're seeing ghosts and shit.

1578
00:41:50.640 --> 00:41:51.060
You know,

1579
00:41:51.060 --> 00:41:52.950
the problem is the scientists to the one,

1580
00:41:52.951 --> 00:41:55.860
they're an analyzing shit and looking for actual results.

1581
00:41:56.130 --> 00:42:00.390
Whereas the people that are like really into spirituality and channelers and

1582
00:42:00.570 --> 00:42:02.110
they're looking to find it

1583
00:42:02.170 --> 00:42:03.610
<v 3>very specific result,</v>

1584
00:42:03.850 --> 00:42:05.570
they're not looking to just measure these things.

1585
00:42:05.590 --> 00:42:06.340
Do you know it's fun.

1586
00:42:06.340 --> 00:42:09.700
You ever done that thing with the muscle testing and they push on your arm,

1587
00:42:09.730 --> 00:42:12.640
they put the little medallion on near the test lumen medallion or whatever,

1588
00:42:12.641 --> 00:42:12.910
and they say,

1589
00:42:12.910 --> 00:42:13.181
Oh,

1590
00:42:13.181 --> 00:42:13.431
you know,

1591
00:42:13.431 --> 00:42:14.140
you're,

1592
00:42:14.140 --> 00:42:18.070
this is a Tesla technology or now it's so okay,

1593
00:42:18.130 --> 00:42:19.250
they put the little wristband,

1594
00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:20.200
little whatever it is.

1595
00:42:20.590 --> 00:42:22.930
So I could never understand how that works.

1596
00:42:22.931 --> 00:42:24.000
Does it make any sense to me?

1597
00:42:25.060 --> 00:42:27.220
So one day it's guy shows up and he says,

1598
00:42:27.221 --> 00:42:27.430
yeah,

1599
00:42:27.430 --> 00:42:27.730
okay,

1600
00:42:27.730 --> 00:42:28.451
let me try this then.

1601
00:42:28.451 --> 00:42:31.090
So I have a desk behind me with a towel on it.

1602
00:42:31.450 --> 00:42:33.040
So now actually there's a proximity thing.

1603
00:42:33.070 --> 00:42:35.960
You gotta be within 10 feet of this thing or something or still has an effect.

1604
00:42:35.961 --> 00:42:36.221
So I said,

1605
00:42:36.221 --> 00:42:36.461
okay,

1606
00:42:36.461 --> 00:42:37.000
okay,

1607
00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:37.970
what is this thing again?

1608
00:42:37.990 --> 00:42:39.240
It's like a medallion,

1609
00:42:39.340 --> 00:42:41.570
medallion Medallia or a ring or a second.

1610
00:42:42.230 --> 00:42:43.040
Yeah.

1611
00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:46.720
They say somethings about Tesla Technology and they put your arm up and they

1612
00:42:46.721 --> 00:42:49.300
pushed down on your arm to see that's all bullshit.

1613
00:42:49.301 --> 00:42:51.200
Those are Kearney tricks and understand how it was worded.

1614
00:42:51.210 --> 00:42:52.120
So I took the thing and I said,

1615
00:42:52.121 --> 00:42:52.271
okay,

1616
00:42:52.271 --> 00:42:52.391
here,

1617
00:42:52.391 --> 00:42:52.910
watch this.

1618
00:42:52.910 --> 00:42:53.850
Took the table behind me,

1619
00:42:54.310 --> 00:42:55.720
I'm going to have it in my hand or not.

1620
00:42:55.980 --> 00:43:00.070
We put it behind my back and either put it up on the table underneath the towel

1621
00:43:00.370 --> 00:43:01.930
or I had it my hand.

1622
00:43:02.260 --> 00:43:05.110
And when I came back then all the tests were off.

1623
00:43:05.170 --> 00:43:08.200
The guy had not a clue how to manipulate the test.

1624
00:43:08.201 --> 00:43:09.020
So yeah.

1625
00:43:09.020 --> 00:43:09.471
<v 2>Oh,</v>

1626
00:43:09.471 --> 00:43:11.270
so he didn't know if you had it on you.

1627
00:43:11.271 --> 00:43:13.340
So then he started doing all this Carney tricks and it didn't,

1628
00:43:13.550 --> 00:43:15.440
he couldn't commit to them cause it didn't work.

1629
00:43:16.690 --> 00:43:17.750
I had to do,

1630
00:43:17.810 --> 00:43:19.280
was trying to produce right with me.

1631
00:43:19.281 --> 00:43:20.210
He did it to my,

1632
00:43:20.211 --> 00:43:20.720
uh,

1633
00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:23.610
my cohost in the UFC and he was believing in it.

1634
00:43:23.620 --> 00:43:24.700
He had one arm shit.

1635
00:43:24.701 --> 00:43:25.161
He was telling me,

1636
00:43:25.161 --> 00:43:25.971
you got to try this,

1637
00:43:25.971 --> 00:43:26.804
it's amazing.

1638
00:43:26.870 --> 00:43:27.321
And I was like,

1639
00:43:27.321 --> 00:43:27.711
what is it?

1640
00:43:27.711 --> 00:43:28.161
And the guy goes,

1641
00:43:28.161 --> 00:43:28.281
well,

1642
00:43:28.281 --> 00:43:29.114
let me explain it to you.

1643
00:43:29.420 --> 00:43:30.470
It's all about Polaris,

1644
00:43:30.530 --> 00:43:30.660
you know,

1645
00:43:30.660 --> 00:43:31.191
start to use it all.

1646
00:43:31.191 --> 00:43:32.060
These weren't that polarity.

1647
00:43:32.061 --> 00:43:34.040
Magnetism is all about fucking Voodoo.

1648
00:43:34.610 --> 00:43:36.050
He's telling me all this stuff.

1649
00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:37.160
And then he said,

1650
00:43:37.161 --> 00:43:37.280
uh,

1651
00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:37.611
this,

1652
00:43:37.611 --> 00:43:37.941
this,

1653
00:43:37.941 --> 00:43:38.061
uh,

1654
00:43:38.061 --> 00:43:40.190
this thing when you put on your risk and to make you stronger.

1655
00:43:40.520 --> 00:43:41.001
And I go,

1656
00:43:41.001 --> 00:43:41.660
really?

1657
00:43:41.660 --> 00:43:42.081
And he goes,

1658
00:43:42.081 --> 00:43:42.680
yeah.

1659
00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:43.430
So he goes,

1660
00:43:43.430 --> 00:43:44.110
all right,

1661
00:43:44.110 --> 00:43:44.570
um,

1662
00:43:44.570 --> 00:43:45.950
well I'm want you to do this.

1663
00:43:45.951 --> 00:43:46.341
And he was like,

1664
00:43:46.341 --> 00:43:47.840
putting it made me put my arm out right.

1665
00:43:47.841 --> 00:43:48.171
Then he goes,

1666
00:43:48.171 --> 00:43:48.411
okay,

1667
00:43:48.411 --> 00:43:49.310
now resist me.

1668
00:43:49.640 --> 00:43:50.210
You know,

1669
00:43:50.210 --> 00:43:50.471
and I,

1670
00:43:50.471 --> 00:43:51.500
and I resisted him.

1671
00:43:51.890 --> 00:43:52.723
And then he's like,

1672
00:43:52.880 --> 00:43:53.420
all right,

1673
00:43:53.420 --> 00:43:54.890
you're not supposed to be able to resist that.

1674
00:43:54.950 --> 00:43:55.490
I was like,

1675
00:43:55.490 --> 00:43:56.420
well look man,

1676
00:43:56.450 --> 00:43:57.350
you making a mistake,

1677
00:43:57.450 --> 00:44:00.130
you've got bad leverage pushing debt.

1678
00:44:00.140 --> 00:44:01.280
You're trying to push down on my arms.

1679
00:44:01.281 --> 00:44:02.114
You're have a big enough,

1680
00:44:02.330 --> 00:44:03.350
I can hold my arms out there.

1681
00:44:03.351 --> 00:44:05.510
Like that lift though.

1682
00:44:05.540 --> 00:44:05.931
Yeah,

1683
00:44:05.931 --> 00:44:06.621
I lift weights.

1684
00:44:06.621 --> 00:44:07.550
The shit ain't gonna work.

1685
00:44:07.700 --> 00:44:08.533
And then he goes,

1686
00:44:08.680 --> 00:44:08.991
all right,

1687
00:44:08.991 --> 00:44:10.160
now I want you to put this on,

1688
00:44:10.220 --> 00:44:10.530
you know,

1689
00:44:10.530 --> 00:44:10.700
like,

1690
00:44:10.700 --> 00:44:12.020
tell me if you feel like stronger.

1691
00:44:12.050 --> 00:44:12.321
I go,

1692
00:44:12.321 --> 00:44:13.370
I'm not any stronger.

1693
00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:16.190
You're not going to get you to be stronger from a fucking little rubber band

1694
00:44:16.191 --> 00:44:16.820
around my wrist.

1695
00:44:16.820 --> 00:44:17.653
This is ridiculous.

1696
00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:18.081
I go,

1697
00:44:18.081 --> 00:44:19.490
you're standing in a different position.

1698
00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:19.881
I go,

1699
00:44:19.881 --> 00:44:20.840
you're doing it differently.

1700
00:44:21.040 --> 00:44:24.170
You were trying to get closer to me before and now you're doing it further away

1701
00:44:24.171 --> 00:44:24.421
from me,

1702
00:44:24.421 --> 00:44:26.270
which you know you have less leverage.

1703
00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:27.261
This is stupid.

1704
00:44:27.261 --> 00:44:27.531
I was like,

1705
00:44:27.531 --> 00:44:28.850
this is dumb as fuck man.

1706
00:44:28.970 --> 00:44:30.620
Parlor trick to got mad at me,

1707
00:44:30.621 --> 00:44:30.920
man.

1708
00:44:30.920 --> 00:44:32.250
He really upset at me.

1709
00:44:32.251 --> 00:44:33.510
His face started getting red.

1710
00:44:33.810 --> 00:44:34.081
I go,

1711
00:44:34.081 --> 00:44:34.681
listen man,

1712
00:44:34.681 --> 00:44:36.830
there's no scientific basis for any of this shit.

1713
00:44:36.831 --> 00:44:37.051
He goes,

1714
00:44:37.051 --> 00:44:37.291
well,

1715
00:44:37.291 --> 00:44:39.000
a hundred thousand hours for each can't be wrong.

1716
00:44:39.120 --> 00:44:40.530
It turns out they were wrong.

1717
00:44:40.730 --> 00:44:42.060
Turns out they sued.

1718
00:44:42.180 --> 00:44:42.301
It.

1719
00:44:42.301 --> 00:44:45.420
Turns out there's a class action lawsuit and all those fucking people got their

1720
00:44:45.421 --> 00:44:45.990
money back.

1721
00:44:45.990 --> 00:44:46.111
I mean,

1722
00:44:46.111 --> 00:44:46.740
he's like a,

1723
00:44:46.740 --> 00:44:47.730
it's a big deal.

1724
00:44:48.600 --> 00:44:49.860
It's a parlor trick.

1725
00:44:50.220 --> 00:44:51.053
Total Horse Shit.

1726
00:44:51.060 --> 00:44:53.920
But I talked to fucking athletes that swore.

1727
00:44:53.930 --> 00:44:54.100
Yeah,

1728
00:44:54.100 --> 00:44:54.620
<v 1>worked.</v>

1729
00:44:54.620 --> 00:44:55.221
They do that.

1730
00:44:55.221 --> 00:44:56.160
The people believed it.

1731
00:44:56.360 --> 00:44:57.071
That's why like you said,

1732
00:44:57.071 --> 00:44:58.400
it was the chamber though,

1733
00:44:58.401 --> 00:45:01.580
is that like they do all those a hoax or this,

1734
00:45:01.581 --> 00:45:02.414
they tried this,

1735
00:45:02.570 --> 00:45:07.040
they tried to acupressure and they do these shows on TV and they try to,

1736
00:45:07.041 --> 00:45:07.700
uh,

1737
00:45:07.700 --> 00:45:08.420
you know,

1738
00:45:08.420 --> 00:45:09.230
just credit,

1739
00:45:09.230 --> 00:45:09.710
uh,

1740
00:45:09.710 --> 00:45:09.981
these,

1741
00:45:09.981 --> 00:45:10.220
uh,

1742
00:45:10.220 --> 00:45:10.830
natural,

1743
00:45:10.830 --> 00:45:11.663
uh,

1744
00:45:11.900 --> 00:45:13.610
well you can't discredit the chamber.

1745
00:45:13.611 --> 00:45:14.840
They have never been able to,

1746
00:45:14.860 --> 00:45:15.510
<v 2>to come up.</v>

1747
00:45:15.510 --> 00:45:16.540
Wouldn't they want to,

1748
00:45:16.600 --> 00:45:17.201
first of all,

1749
00:45:17.201 --> 00:45:17.381
it's,

1750
00:45:17.381 --> 00:45:18.940
it's so natural.

1751
00:45:18.970 --> 00:45:21.220
It's so natural and so positive and you look at,

1752
00:45:21.221 --> 00:45:25.120
it's so ingenious and it's designed 10 effect with Epsom salts

1753
00:45:25.650 --> 00:45:27.060
<v 1>does something,</v>

1754
00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:29.700
it helps you do something with yourself.

1755
00:45:29.701 --> 00:45:30.390
And I mean,

1756
00:45:30.390 --> 00:45:32.220
what else is there that does that hardly

1757
00:45:32.300 --> 00:45:33.980
<v 2>and it's super relaxing,</v>

1758
00:45:35.040 --> 00:45:36.470
more relaxing,

1759
00:45:36.650 --> 00:45:37.880
and we could all use to relax.

1760
00:45:37.910 --> 00:45:38.151
Fuck.

1761
00:45:38.151 --> 00:45:38.481
I know.

1762
00:45:38.481 --> 00:45:38.901
I can't,

1763
00:45:38.901 --> 00:45:39.930
God dammit.

1764
00:45:40.910 --> 00:45:42.620
I can fucking use to relax.

1765
00:45:42.710 --> 00:45:43.190
<v 1>Oh wait.</v>

1766
00:45:43.190 --> 00:45:44.510
People are coming together in a big hurry.

1767
00:45:44.880 --> 00:45:45.290
Hurry,

1768
00:45:45.290 --> 00:45:46.120
hurry to relax.

1769
00:45:46.120 --> 00:45:46.441
Yeah,

1770
00:45:46.441 --> 00:45:47.000
they're in a hurry.

1771
00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:47.601
Hurry up rocks.

1772
00:45:47.601 --> 00:45:51.770
Or I don't only have an hour getting there quick and we give him two hours for

1773
00:45:51.771 --> 00:45:52.450
40 bucks.

1774
00:45:52.450 --> 00:45:53.350
<v 2>That's amazing.</v>

1775
00:45:53.351 --> 00:45:53.831
By the way,

1776
00:45:53.831 --> 00:45:55.390
you have the best fucking rates,

1777
00:45:55.391 --> 00:45:55.930
man.

1778
00:45:55.930 --> 00:45:57.160
Nobody has rates like that.

1779
00:45:57.161 --> 00:45:57.994
Everybody else is like,

1780
00:45:58.090 --> 00:45:59.710
I've heard 50 bucks an hour.

1781
00:45:59.711 --> 00:46:00.730
I've heard people saying,

1782
00:46:00.731 --> 00:46:01.241
well you know,

1783
00:46:01.241 --> 00:46:02.110
there's no money in this,

1784
00:46:02.111 --> 00:46:03.100
there's no profit in it.

1785
00:46:03.101 --> 00:46:03.851
So it's,

1786
00:46:03.851 --> 00:46:06.400
we have to charge this much just to keep the doors open.

1787
00:46:06.730 --> 00:46:08.740
But what you've always done is a,

1788
00:46:08.741 --> 00:46:11.680
I mean I can't tell you how many people have gone to the full lab and with dude,

1789
00:46:11.681 --> 00:46:12.371
it was so cheap.

1790
00:46:12.371 --> 00:46:12.671
I was like,

1791
00:46:12.671 --> 00:46:13.090
yeah,

1792
00:46:13.090 --> 00:46:13.630
yeah.

1793
00:46:13.630 --> 00:46:14.170
And comparing,

1794
00:46:14.170 --> 00:46:14.831
like in my town,

1795
00:46:14.831 --> 00:46:15.990
it's 150 bucks for an hour.

1796
00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:16.870
Like I've heard that,

1797
00:46:16.871 --> 00:46:19.450
I've heard 150 bucks for an hour.

1798
00:46:19.700 --> 00:46:20.710
It's the most expensive.

1799
00:46:20.711 --> 00:46:22.080
You ever heard someone charges?

1800
00:46:22.100 --> 00:46:23.720
<v 1>Can I know buck 20 and stuff?</v>

1801
00:46:23.750 --> 00:46:25.260
I don't see it just,

1802
00:46:25.340 --> 00:46:29.480
it pumps me out because it's not cool to charge people like that to try to,

1803
00:46:29.810 --> 00:46:30.300
you know,

1804
00:46:30.300 --> 00:46:30.680
if,

1805
00:46:30.680 --> 00:46:31.100
if you,

1806
00:46:31.100 --> 00:46:32.160
if she doesn't,

1807
00:46:32.161 --> 00:46:32.840
if people said,

1808
00:46:32.840 --> 00:46:33.211
oh you're not,

1809
00:46:33.211 --> 00:46:34.044
you're gonna charge more.

1810
00:46:34.070 --> 00:46:34.221
Well,

1811
00:46:34.221 --> 00:46:34.730
so what?

1812
00:46:34.730 --> 00:46:35.451
I don't have to,

1813
00:46:35.451 --> 00:46:35.760
I don't.

1814
00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:36.001
<v 2>Well,</v>

1815
00:46:36.001 --> 00:46:39.510
if you have an initial investment and you build an x amount of tanks and then

1816
00:46:39.511 --> 00:46:41.400
you have a place where it makes sense,

1817
00:46:41.401 --> 00:46:45.750
like as far as like the amount of rent and then you just have them filled all

1818
00:46:45.750 --> 00:46:45.780
day long.

1819
00:46:45.780 --> 00:46:46.740
It can be profitable.

1820
00:46:46.741 --> 00:46:49.080
I mean you're not going to be Rockefeller not going to,

1821
00:46:49.120 --> 00:46:50.250
but you're not trying to do that.

1822
00:46:50.251 --> 00:46:51.720
You're just trying to express this shit.

1823
00:46:51.770 --> 00:46:54.360
<v 1>I'm trying to accommodate the people in general.</v>

1824
00:46:54.361 --> 00:46:56.100
Not a specific group of people.

1825
00:46:56.460 --> 00:46:57.690
Like I remember when he said the clubs,

1826
00:46:57.691 --> 00:46:59.640
I always have the Jello shooters for doll.

1827
00:46:59.660 --> 00:47:01.400
I have a dollar brew a beer,

1828
00:47:01.830 --> 00:47:03.780
always a dollar drafts are always,

1829
00:47:03.781 --> 00:47:04.611
and then I have dollars.

1830
00:47:04.611 --> 00:47:04.780
Shit.

1831
00:47:04.780 --> 00:47:06.450
All My synopsis is a dollar,

1832
00:47:06.810 --> 00:47:07.200
you know,

1833
00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:09.620
cause the people that the money is a thing for you.

1834
00:47:09.621 --> 00:47:10.710
You're dealing with regular.

1835
00:47:10.740 --> 00:47:11.520
You want to have,

1836
00:47:11.520 --> 00:47:12.660
what is your objective?

1837
00:47:12.690 --> 00:47:13.800
Are you trying to make,

1838
00:47:13.830 --> 00:47:15.060
is this your money thing?

1839
00:47:15.070 --> 00:47:18.810
Are you trying to provide a service and and create equations?

1840
00:47:19.180 --> 00:47:20.840
<v 2>Like does it come to you?</v>

1841
00:47:20.841 --> 00:47:21.081
Like,

1842
00:47:21.081 --> 00:47:22.130
I never hear anybody.

1843
00:47:22.520 --> 00:47:25.160
I've never once heard anybody go do your thing and go,

1844
00:47:25.161 --> 00:47:25.521
you know what?

1845
00:47:25.521 --> 00:47:26.570
Crash was rude.

1846
00:47:26.571 --> 00:47:27.560
The place sucked.

1847
00:47:27.800 --> 00:47:29.030
The tanks were expensive.

1848
00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:30.130
No one's ever said that.

1849
00:47:30.131 --> 00:47:30.580
They always say,

1850
00:47:30.580 --> 00:47:31.170
oh crashes.

1851
00:47:31.170 --> 00:47:31.631
So cool.

1852
00:47:31.631 --> 00:47:32.500
The place is so nice.

1853
00:47:32.501 --> 00:47:33.221
I love it there.

1854
00:47:33.221 --> 00:47:34.054
It's great.

1855
00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:35.193
Like no,

1856
00:47:35.320 --> 00:47:36.640
no one has any negativity.

1857
00:47:36.910 --> 00:47:37.240
Well that's,

1858
00:47:37.240 --> 00:47:38.220
that's like Ian.

1859
00:47:38.230 --> 00:47:39.730
So handsome looking them over there.

1860
00:47:40.180 --> 00:47:41.013
Beautiful Bastard.

1861
00:47:41.560 --> 00:47:42.730
They come and stop girls.

1862
00:47:42.731 --> 00:47:43.300
I like that.

1863
00:47:43.300 --> 00:47:43.631
Oh,

1864
00:47:43.631 --> 00:47:44.464
that's good move.

1865
00:47:44.500 --> 00:47:44.651
She,

1866
00:47:44.651 --> 00:47:46.420
Ian Should Be oiled up and shirtless.

1867
00:47:46.421 --> 00:47:47.770
You'd track dudes and girls.

1868
00:47:47.771 --> 00:47:51.130
Is that you have people coming in from all around to use those tanks?

1869
00:47:51.670 --> 00:47:52.870
Did he didn't use his tank?

1870
00:47:53.540 --> 00:47:54.373
Yeah.

1871
00:47:55.390 --> 00:47:56.020
<v 1>Oh Hey.</v>

1872
00:47:56.020 --> 00:47:57.910
That's another thing.

1873
00:47:57.911 --> 00:47:59.020
We have your old chamber.

1874
00:47:59.021 --> 00:47:59.651
I want to give it away.

1875
00:47:59.651 --> 00:47:59.921
We,

1876
00:47:59.921 --> 00:48:00.340
uh,

1877
00:48:00.340 --> 00:48:01.390
we updated that thing.

1878
00:48:01.800 --> 00:48:02.860
It's all black now.

1879
00:48:03.220 --> 00:48:03.970
We made the intro,

1880
00:48:03.970 --> 00:48:05.080
we changed the door out.

1881
00:48:05.260 --> 00:48:06.030
Now it's a,

1882
00:48:06.030 --> 00:48:07.440
it's a black door and it's,

1883
00:48:07.500 --> 00:48:09.700
it's inlaid and we've taken,

1884
00:48:09.701 --> 00:48:11.110
we've fixed it all up.

1885
00:48:11.380 --> 00:48:11.531
<v 2>Oh,</v>

1886
00:48:11.531 --> 00:48:12.131
that's awesome.

1887
00:48:12.131 --> 00:48:13.120
So something with it.

1888
00:48:13.150 --> 00:48:13.840
Let's do that.

1889
00:48:13.840 --> 00:48:14.061
Let's,

1890
00:48:14.061 --> 00:48:14.530
um,

1891
00:48:14.530 --> 00:48:16.390
tell me what we need to do and we'll uh,

1892
00:48:16.391 --> 00:48:17.170
we'll give it away.

1893
00:48:17.170 --> 00:48:17.880
Thus,

1894
00:48:17.880 --> 00:48:19.360
cause I gave away my last tank.

1895
00:48:19.390 --> 00:48:19.750
Yeah.

1896
00:48:19.750 --> 00:48:20.770
My Somani tank.

1897
00:48:20.830 --> 00:48:21.101
I,

1898
00:48:21.101 --> 00:48:21.461
uh,

1899
00:48:21.461 --> 00:48:23.230
I had a random drawing online.

1900
00:48:23.231 --> 00:48:24.880
People send me their emails and I just went,

1901
00:48:25.150 --> 00:48:26.200
I spun my,

1902
00:48:26.201 --> 00:48:27.430
like fit the thing with my,

1903
00:48:27.431 --> 00:48:27.790
uh,

1904
00:48:27.790 --> 00:48:28.750
my laptop and I'm like,

1905
00:48:29.650 --> 00:48:30.041
okay,

1906
00:48:30.041 --> 00:48:30.820
this guy.

1907
00:48:30.820 --> 00:48:32.110
And then I just sent it to that guy,

1908
00:48:32.140 --> 00:48:33.280
just total random,

1909
00:48:33.281 --> 00:48:36.340
decided to send it to this one guy in San Diego and he got my tank.

1910
00:48:36.400 --> 00:48:36.551
Well,

1911
00:48:36.551 --> 00:48:37.390
this is shipped it to him.

1912
00:48:38.310 --> 00:48:39.510
<v 1>We tuned it all up.</v>

1913
00:48:39.520 --> 00:48:40.680
It's an not religious vehicle,

1914
00:48:40.681 --> 00:48:40.951
man.

1915
00:48:40.951 --> 00:48:41.151
It's,

1916
00:48:41.151 --> 00:48:42.810
it's a cool Rick and it's uh,

1917
00:48:43.270 --> 00:48:43.500
you know,

1918
00:48:43.500 --> 00:48:44.281
it's your old thing.

1919
00:48:44.281 --> 00:48:44.730
So is it,

1920
00:48:44.730 --> 00:48:46.170
how much does the salt cost?

1921
00:48:46.640 --> 00:48:47.473
Uh,

1922
00:48:47.880 --> 00:48:49.100
it's funny about that to you.

1923
00:48:49.101 --> 00:48:49.521
So you get,

1924
00:48:49.521 --> 00:48:54.521
you thinking about the Epson salt may needs himself fake USP grade,

1925
00:48:54.901 --> 00:48:55.230
right?

1926
00:48:55.230 --> 00:48:55.770
Yes.

1927
00:48:55.770 --> 00:48:57.270
It depends on where you get it at.

1928
00:48:57.271 --> 00:48:58.640
Even though it's labeled the same way.

1929
00:48:58.660 --> 00:49:00.660
USP is a pharmaceutical grade.

1930
00:49:01.050 --> 00:49:02.360
There's a quality is different.

1931
00:49:02.460 --> 00:49:05.760
Like is there anyway you could get it at the home?

1932
00:49:05.820 --> 00:49:06.151
I mean,

1933
00:49:06.151 --> 00:49:10.380
at the bed bath and B or a 99 cent store for 50 cents a pound.

1934
00:49:10.530 --> 00:49:11.363
Right.

1935
00:49:12.050 --> 00:49:13.040
<v 2>It's not the highest grade,</v>

1936
00:49:13.460 --> 00:49:15.370
even though you got to get it from you,

1937
00:49:15.371 --> 00:49:17.160
you hook me up with some chemical company.

1938
00:49:18.090 --> 00:49:18.820
<v 1>Got It with right.</v>

1939
00:49:18.820 --> 00:49:19.520
Yeah.

1940
00:49:19.520 --> 00:49:20.460
And it's like 75,

1941
00:49:20.490 --> 00:49:22.290
80 cents a pound or something there,

1942
00:49:22.350 --> 00:49:22.861
which is,

1943
00:49:22.861 --> 00:49:23.694
you know,

1944
00:49:23.700 --> 00:49:25.830
but so I figure it's like a thousand pounds.

1945
00:49:25.831 --> 00:49:26.880
It's like 800 bucks.

1946
00:49:28.350 --> 00:49:28.741
But the,

1947
00:49:28.741 --> 00:49:29.750
that chamber though isn't,

1948
00:49:29.751 --> 00:49:30.850
it is in Primos shape.

1949
00:49:30.851 --> 00:49:34.800
We have it all fixed up and one day we'll figure out what we're going to do.

1950
00:49:34.830 --> 00:49:35.401
Cause you know,

1951
00:49:35.401 --> 00:49:35.520
we're,

1952
00:49:35.520 --> 00:49:37.110
we're going to be talking more about this,

1953
00:49:37.111 --> 00:49:37.500
uh,

1954
00:49:37.500 --> 00:49:38.910
this venue in Westwood.

1955
00:49:39.070 --> 00:49:39.281
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1956
00:49:39.281 --> 00:49:40.870
So you're going to open up a place in Westwood.

1957
00:49:40.871 --> 00:49:42.430
When is it going to be open for the public?

1958
00:49:42.780 --> 00:49:43.440
<v 1>Good question.</v>

1959
00:49:43.440 --> 00:49:45.240
We've been working on it for a while now because of the,

1960
00:49:45.241 --> 00:49:46.074
uh,

1961
00:49:46.170 --> 00:49:46.680
a few,

1962
00:49:46.680 --> 00:49:47.513
uh,

1963
00:49:48.300 --> 00:49:50.910
details with people that we needed to,

1964
00:49:50.911 --> 00:49:51.744
uh,

1965
00:49:51.780 --> 00:49:52.613
get behind.

1966
00:49:52.660 --> 00:49:55.150
<v 2>How many tanks do you have right now in Venice to two.</v>

1967
00:49:55.210 --> 00:49:55.690
That's it.

1968
00:49:55.690 --> 00:49:56.260
That's it.

1969
00:49:56.260 --> 00:49:57.093
Wow.

1970
00:49:57.340 --> 00:49:57.880
And uh,

1971
00:49:57.880 --> 00:49:58.960
take place in Westwood a little,

1972
00:49:58.961 --> 00:49:59.590
have 10,

1973
00:49:59.590 --> 00:50:00.423
10.

1974
00:50:00.460 --> 00:50:01.240
Oh,

1975
00:50:01.240 --> 00:50:04.390
so two w in Venice are booked up like deep into August,

1976
00:50:04.391 --> 00:50:04.660
right?

1977
00:50:04.660 --> 00:50:05.493
Yes.

1978
00:50:05.710 --> 00:50:07.510
And would be if you've probably had 20 of them,

1979
00:50:07.630 --> 00:50:07.900
<v 1>you know,</v>

1980
00:50:07.900 --> 00:50:08.570
he turned up,

1981
00:50:08.570 --> 00:50:09.670
there's a lot of calls.

1982
00:50:10.060 --> 00:50:12.160
We don't make an effort to,

1983
00:50:12.161 --> 00:50:12.994
uh,

1984
00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:13.631
utilize,

1985
00:50:13.631 --> 00:50:14.140
uh,

1986
00:50:14.140 --> 00:50:14.441
any,

1987
00:50:14.441 --> 00:50:14.681
you know,

1988
00:50:14.681 --> 00:50:18.370
like there's been some shows on the TV shows wanting to come in and we haven't

1989
00:50:18.371 --> 00:50:18.730
even been able,

1990
00:50:18.730 --> 00:50:19.690
we don't have any time.

1991
00:50:19.820 --> 00:50:20.130
Right.

1992
00:50:20.130 --> 00:50:20.770
So it's like saying,

1993
00:50:20.770 --> 00:50:21.220
oh,

1994
00:50:21.220 --> 00:50:22.740
they want to come and film there or something.

1995
00:50:22.870 --> 00:50:22.991
<v 2>Well,</v>

1996
00:50:22.991 --> 00:50:23.920
vice film there,

1997
00:50:23.980 --> 00:50:24.491
that was cool.

1998
00:50:24.491 --> 00:50:25.360
And Hamilton Morris,

1999
00:50:25.361 --> 00:50:26.890
I remember he contacted me after it was over.

2000
00:50:26.891 --> 00:50:29.330
He said it was one of the most life changing things he's ever done.

2001
00:50:29.331 --> 00:50:32.710
He ate a pot edible and got into your tank and it's just like changed his world.

2002
00:50:32.800 --> 00:50:32.891
<v 1>Well,</v>

2003
00:50:32.891 --> 00:50:33.820
it changed our world too.

2004
00:50:34.150 --> 00:50:34.721
That really,

2005
00:50:34.721 --> 00:50:35.020
uh,

2006
00:50:35.020 --> 00:50:35.291
was,

2007
00:50:35.291 --> 00:50:35.950
it was mix.

2008
00:50:35.950 --> 00:50:38.800
What is an extraordinary opportunity for us then to,

2009
00:50:38.801 --> 00:50:39.634
uh,

2010
00:50:40.060 --> 00:50:40.391
to,

2011
00:50:40.391 --> 00:50:41.200
uh,

2012
00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:44.020
have the chance to show some people what this was about.

2013
00:50:44.021 --> 00:50:44.620
He,

2014
00:50:44.620 --> 00:50:46.120
he informed a lot of people,

2015
00:50:46.480 --> 00:50:46.871
you know,

2016
00:50:46.871 --> 00:50:47.530
uh,

2017
00:50:47.530 --> 00:50:47.891
you know,

2018
00:50:47.891 --> 00:50:49.900
you and him and other people that,

2019
00:50:49.930 --> 00:50:50.261
you know,

2020
00:50:50.261 --> 00:50:51.550
that mostly it's just you and me.

2021
00:50:51.551 --> 00:50:53.290
I Dunno who else has really been,

2022
00:50:53.530 --> 00:50:53.771
<v 2>well,</v>

2023
00:50:53.771 --> 00:50:55.090
that was his first jaunt.

2024
00:50:55.360 --> 00:50:55.721
Yeah,

2025
00:50:55.721 --> 00:50:57.670
his first real run in the tank.

2026
00:50:57.880 --> 00:51:02.880
But he's his whole thing that Pharmacopia show that he does really was

2027
00:51:03.790 --> 00:51:04.451
fascinating.

2028
00:51:04.451 --> 00:51:06.400
He got a lot of really fascinating episode episodes,

2029
00:51:06.401 --> 00:51:07.300
really cool.

2030
00:51:07.550 --> 00:51:08.140
Um,

2031
00:51:08.140 --> 00:51:11.590
well produced episodes where they covered a lot of different kinds of

2032
00:51:11.591 --> 00:51:12.251
psychedelics,

2033
00:51:12.251 --> 00:51:13.570
a lot of different kinds of subjects.

2034
00:51:13.571 --> 00:51:14.500
But this,

2035
00:51:14.540 --> 00:51:15.490
this subject,

2036
00:51:15.700 --> 00:51:16.061
this,

2037
00:51:16.061 --> 00:51:16.540
um,

2038
00:51:16.540 --> 00:51:19.600
this whole thing where people are getting curious about altered states of

2039
00:51:19.601 --> 00:51:24.601
consciousness is increasing and growing and even more so this idea that you

2040
00:51:25.091 --> 00:51:28.870
could do it in something like the tank where it's totally natural and safe and

2041
00:51:28.871 --> 00:51:29.441
healthy,

2042
00:51:29.441 --> 00:51:29.770
you know,

2043
00:51:29.770 --> 00:51:30.850
don't worry about it.

2044
00:51:30.851 --> 00:51:32.440
And so I think,

2045
00:51:32.441 --> 00:51:32.800
uh,

2046
00:51:32.800 --> 00:51:33.820
I think it's all part of,

2047
00:51:33.830 --> 00:51:34.230
um,

2048
00:51:34.230 --> 00:51:39.230
this new sort of expanding of our ideas that we're seeing in today's society.

2049
00:51:41.200 --> 00:51:43.400
It's an expanding of what,

2050
00:51:43.410 --> 00:51:43.980
what is,

2051
00:51:43.980 --> 00:51:44.231
you know,

2052
00:51:44.231 --> 00:51:45.460
what do you have in your life?

2053
00:51:45.461 --> 00:51:46.420
What's in your world,

2054
00:51:46.450 --> 00:51:47.230
you know,

2055
00:51:47.230 --> 00:51:47.561
you know,

2056
00:51:47.561 --> 00:51:49.180
what are you adding to your body?

2057
00:51:49.181 --> 00:51:50.890
What are you adding to your day?

2058
00:51:51.130 --> 00:51:53.620
How are you expanding your consciousness,

2059
00:51:53.621 --> 00:51:54.454
your point of view.

2060
00:51:54.750 --> 00:51:56.910
<v 1>These are all new things to new,</v>

2061
00:51:56.990 --> 00:51:57.751
new,

2062
00:51:57.751 --> 00:51:58.350
uh,

2063
00:51:58.350 --> 00:51:58.921
new,

2064
00:51:58.921 --> 00:51:59.190
uh,

2065
00:51:59.190 --> 00:52:00.300
considerations.

2066
00:52:00.600 --> 00:52:05.600
These are points to consider that in the past we really haven't been left up to

2067
00:52:05.611 --> 00:52:06.420
the individual.

2068
00:52:06.420 --> 00:52:08.940
It's mostly like you go along with the tide,

2069
00:52:09.300 --> 00:52:09.631
you know,

2070
00:52:09.631 --> 00:52:11.250
but now you can,

2071
00:52:11.310 --> 00:52:12.870
you could grab a hold of yourself and say,

2072
00:52:12.871 --> 00:52:14.110
listen to him and I'm in a,

2073
00:52:14.220 --> 00:52:17.220
I'm going to think about this the way I think about it and then make the

2074
00:52:17.221 --> 00:52:18.180
decisions to,

2075
00:52:18.210 --> 00:52:19.043
you know,

2076
00:52:20.520 --> 00:52:21.860
have a B,

2077
00:52:22.020 --> 00:52:23.580
you're not a victim anymore.

2078
00:52:23.610 --> 00:52:23.741
You know,

2079
00:52:23.741 --> 00:52:24.301
I was a victim.

2080
00:52:24.301 --> 00:52:24.961
All their this,

2081
00:52:24.961 --> 00:52:26.370
their that Ah,

2082
00:52:26.371 --> 00:52:26.611
you know,

2083
00:52:26.611 --> 00:52:27.480
they are what they are,

2084
00:52:27.481 --> 00:52:32.010
but you now you with the ability to recognize your,

2085
00:52:32.040 --> 00:52:32.401
you know,

2086
00:52:32.401 --> 00:52:33.470
that you,

2087
00:52:33.570 --> 00:52:36.270
you are capable and that you are,

2088
00:52:36.271 --> 00:52:37.104
uh,

2089
00:52:37.230 --> 00:52:38.063
uh,

2090
00:52:38.370 --> 00:52:39.240
potentially,

2091
00:52:39.270 --> 00:52:39.870
uh,

2092
00:52:39.870 --> 00:52:41.040
just getting started.

2093
00:52:41.100 --> 00:52:41.461
I mean,

2094
00:52:41.461 --> 00:52:42.930
we're all young.

2095
00:52:42.960 --> 00:52:43.380
Uh,

2096
00:52:43.380 --> 00:52:44.460
if we want to be,

2097
00:52:44.940 --> 00:52:47.940
<v 2>if you want to be certainly all a work in progress and you know,</v>

2098
00:52:47.941 --> 00:52:50.430
let's hope the more you keep improving yourself,

2099
00:52:50.431 --> 00:52:52.500
the more you enjoy this process of life.

2100
00:52:52.740 --> 00:52:53.670
So we were talking about like,

2101
00:52:53.671 --> 00:52:56.190
people like try and pull out these people love trying new shit.

2102
00:52:56.220 --> 00:52:56.730
You know,

2103
00:52:56.730 --> 00:52:57.990
I get into archery recently.

2104
00:52:57.991 --> 00:52:58.471
It's fun.

2105
00:52:58.471 --> 00:53:00.360
It's like something exciting about learning something,

2106
00:53:00.361 --> 00:53:00.571
you know,

2107
00:53:00.571 --> 00:53:03.660
you don't know that much about it and you can see your progress,

2108
00:53:03.840 --> 00:53:04.021
you know,

2109
00:53:04.021 --> 00:53:04.870
maybe you know,

2110
00:53:04.890 --> 00:53:08.370
take up a martial art or a sport or a skill.

2111
00:53:08.371 --> 00:53:08.770
Yeah.

2112
00:53:08.770 --> 00:53:10.610
Something that you can start doing something

2113
00:53:10.670 --> 00:53:11.391
<v 1>sewing.</v>

2114
00:53:11.391 --> 00:53:12.020
I mean,

2115
00:53:12.020 --> 00:53:13.250
I don't know anything.

2116
00:53:13.251 --> 00:53:15.470
I mean the uh,

2117
00:53:16.310 --> 00:53:16.761
you know,

2118
00:53:16.761 --> 00:53:17.594
uh,

2119
00:53:17.640 --> 00:53:17.970
it's,

2120
00:53:17.970 --> 00:53:19.520
it's good to have a balance.

2121
00:53:19.570 --> 00:53:20.270
Yeah.

2122
00:53:20.270 --> 00:53:20.720
<v 2>It is.</v>

2123
00:53:20.720 --> 00:53:20.941
It's a,

2124
00:53:20.941 --> 00:53:21.680
it's super,

2125
00:53:21.680 --> 00:53:25.560
super important to have a balance and also to find things in your life that

2126
00:53:25.561 --> 00:53:26.394
stimulate you.

2127
00:53:26.520 --> 00:53:28.830
The more things that I do that excite me and stimulate me,

2128
00:53:28.980 --> 00:53:30.990
the more things that I do where I'm learning new stuff,

2129
00:53:31.320 --> 00:53:31.890
you know,

2130
00:53:31.890 --> 00:53:32.723
it's just,

2131
00:53:32.940 --> 00:53:34.840
I get into things and they,

2132
00:53:34.850 --> 00:53:37.650
those things that I get into wind up enriching my life.

2133
00:53:37.651 --> 00:53:41.330
The enthusiasm that I get from pursuing some new subject that I meant.

2134
00:53:42.590 --> 00:53:43.101
<v 3>Cool.</v>

2135
00:53:43.101 --> 00:53:44.990
When you're learning what you want to learn about,

2136
00:53:45.170 --> 00:53:46.730
which is why I wanted to talk

2137
00:53:46.810 --> 00:53:50.560
<v 2>to you about these crazy screens that you're trying to hook up these tanks with.</v>

2138
00:53:50.830 --> 00:53:55.240
This is the thing that crash was going off about forever was the screens that

2139
00:53:55.241 --> 00:53:59.980
would suspend above the tank and admit the lowest amount of light possible so

2140
00:53:59.981 --> 00:54:01.270
that you only saw the image,

2141
00:54:01.540 --> 00:54:05.140
he didn't see the actual screen itself or the border itself.

2142
00:54:05.290 --> 00:54:09.820
You just saw the image in front of you and in that sensory deprivation state or

2143
00:54:09.821 --> 00:54:12.820
the only input it was coming in was what you were catching off the screen and

2144
00:54:12.821 --> 00:54:17.821
what you were hearing from the program that your mind would be way more easily,

2145
00:54:18.520 --> 00:54:21.910
way more able to absorb the information.

2146
00:54:22.330 --> 00:54:25.910
<v 1>It's a trip after five tries.</v>

2147
00:54:26.020 --> 00:54:29.350
Military providers would use to get this thing finally doing what it's supposed

2148
00:54:29.351 --> 00:54:33.520
to do anyway is it had been difficult to get it to be contained.

2149
00:54:33.521 --> 00:54:36.170
That image in that area that it has to be on with Fort.

2150
00:54:37.240 --> 00:54:39.010
So that that was very,

2151
00:54:39.150 --> 00:54:41.650
because you know you're laying down looking at it and one of the first things

2152
00:54:41.651 --> 00:54:45.010
that we figured out was because you're on your back is up there.

2153
00:54:45.280 --> 00:54:48.070
So He'd take it and you go like this and you go oop.

2154
00:54:48.250 --> 00:54:50.110
And as soon as the screen changes around,

2155
00:54:50.410 --> 00:54:54.130
you're convinced that you're standing on your feet and looking forward on your

2156
00:54:54.131 --> 00:54:55.480
feet at the screen.

2157
00:54:55.570 --> 00:54:56.080
Really?

2158
00:54:56.080 --> 00:54:56.800
Oh,

2159
00:54:56.800 --> 00:54:58.030
this is one of the first things.

2160
00:54:58.031 --> 00:55:00.400
And then there's some other stuff there that you know that,

2161
00:55:00.670 --> 00:55:03.610
<v 2>so when you're lying on your back and you watching the video,</v>

2162
00:55:03.670 --> 00:55:04.820
you think that you're standing up,

2163
00:55:04.821 --> 00:55:04.920
right?

2164
00:55:04.920 --> 00:55:06.810
<v 3>Do you take the video that you make them?</v>

2165
00:55:07.080 --> 00:55:08.940
There is no video for this really,

2166
00:55:08.941 --> 00:55:11.100
because it's like mostly your brain.

2167
00:55:11.310 --> 00:55:13.700
You don't want to see a gone with the wind or,

2168
00:55:13.740 --> 00:55:14.573
or you know,

2169
00:55:15.090 --> 00:55:15.990
it your,

2170
00:55:15.991 --> 00:55:17.070
your whole mind.

2171
00:55:17.071 --> 00:55:17.904
Yeah.

2172
00:55:18.030 --> 00:55:18.750
<v 1>Yes.</v>

2173
00:55:18.750 --> 00:55:20.340
Patterns or movements or whatever.

2174
00:55:20.341 --> 00:55:23.040
We've been working with different stuff as much as we can with the time.

2175
00:55:23.310 --> 00:55:24.270
We don't have enough time,

2176
00:55:24.271 --> 00:55:24.991
but when we come back,

2177
00:55:24.991 --> 00:55:25.824
we have a,

2178
00:55:26.310 --> 00:55:30.600
we have a strategy then to start to produce these programs involved in,

2179
00:55:30.601 --> 00:55:31.434
uh,

2180
00:55:31.590 --> 00:55:31.950
uh,

2181
00:55:31.950 --> 00:55:32.783
the system.

2182
00:55:32.880 --> 00:55:33.271
But the,

2183
00:55:33.271 --> 00:55:34.104
uh,

2184
00:55:34.140 --> 00:55:35.460
the initial,

2185
00:55:35.461 --> 00:55:36.294
uh,

2186
00:55:36.960 --> 00:55:39.410
what's occurring there with that is a,

2187
00:55:39.820 --> 00:55:40.531
and then,

2188
00:55:40.531 --> 00:55:40.771
you know,

2189
00:55:40.771 --> 00:55:41.401
that's a,

2190
00:55:41.401 --> 00:55:42.390
that's the future future.

2191
00:55:42.470 --> 00:55:44.160
<v 3>You see this what we explain it though,</v>

2192
00:55:44.161 --> 00:55:47.520
there's a screen that's hovering over your face.

2193
00:55:47.600 --> 00:55:47.751
Ah,

2194
00:55:47.751 --> 00:55:48.870
how when you're laying on your back,

2195
00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:49.890
how wide is it?

2196
00:55:50.160 --> 00:55:50.550
It's a,

2197
00:55:50.550 --> 00:55:52.770
the one we have now is 19 inches because they,

2198
00:55:52.771 --> 00:55:53.340
uh,

2199
00:55:53.340 --> 00:55:55.080
material required to build it.

2200
00:55:55.410 --> 00:55:56.400
They can't get it any bigger.

2201
00:55:56.430 --> 00:55:58.080
Now though,

2202
00:55:58.110 --> 00:55:59.910
there's 32 inch screen material.

2203
00:55:59.911 --> 00:56:01.110
I can get it to make the,

2204
00:56:01.111 --> 00:56:01.890
uh,

2205
00:56:01.890 --> 00:56:03.810
to make it 32 inches across.

2206
00:56:03.811 --> 00:56:07.780
But is there a size that it's no longer good because you have to go to the

2207
00:56:07.820 --> 00:56:08.653
blackboard?

2208
00:56:08.750 --> 00:56:09.451
It's all black.

2209
00:56:09.451 --> 00:56:11.040
So it was a whole thing as a screen.

2210
00:56:11.260 --> 00:56:12.200
But the,

2211
00:56:12.201 --> 00:56:12.570
the,

2212
00:56:12.570 --> 00:56:12.920
the,

2213
00:56:12.920 --> 00:56:13.950
the image,

2214
00:56:13.951 --> 00:56:15.630
we'll move around within the screen.

2215
00:56:15.900 --> 00:56:17.070
So you have it all black.

2216
00:56:17.370 --> 00:56:18.630
We working on something,

2217
00:56:18.720 --> 00:56:19.171
you know,

2218
00:56:19.171 --> 00:56:21.840
like those tiles in the bottom.

2219
00:56:22.200 --> 00:56:26.140
So if you're in a now and you're laying them back on your dome and those tiles

2220
00:56:26.141 --> 00:56:30.070
are underneath you so that the bottom is waterproof of course.

2221
00:56:30.070 --> 00:56:32.650
But you use the lights on the bottom,

2222
00:56:32.660 --> 00:56:33.880
a projector or whatever,

2223
00:56:33.881 --> 00:56:34.151
you know,

2224
00:56:34.151 --> 00:56:35.890
and on the bottom in a dome,

2225
00:56:36.430 --> 00:56:40.210
you're laying on your back and the dome then is all filled in with a screens.

2226
00:56:40.310 --> 00:56:41.050
Oh,

2227
00:56:41.050 --> 00:56:42.010
and the bottom.

2228
00:56:42.250 --> 00:56:46.240
So now you're laying in this thing and you're flying through space and a dumb

2229
00:56:46.420 --> 00:56:48.970
the upside everywhere you look and then it flips you over.

2230
00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:49.520
But wait a minute.

2231
00:56:49.520 --> 00:56:50.353
Wait,

2232
00:56:51.370 --> 00:56:53.290
but you can see you can't see through the water.

2233
00:56:53.350 --> 00:56:53.590
Yeah,

2234
00:56:53.590 --> 00:56:54.580
it's clear as a bell.

2235
00:56:55.300 --> 00:56:56.133
So,

2236
00:56:56.620 --> 00:57:00.380
but wouldn't that ruin the whole idea of sensory deprivation?

2237
00:57:00.420 --> 00:57:00.830
It was new.

2238
00:57:00.830 --> 00:57:03.370
It's a whole nother thing underneath you to see light.

2239
00:57:03.371 --> 00:57:06.400
You're flying but you can't turn behind you and look behind you.

2240
00:57:06.550 --> 00:57:07.690
If it's screen everywhere,

2241
00:57:07.691 --> 00:57:08.620
you're enclosed.

2242
00:57:08.630 --> 00:57:09.463
And this is,

2243
00:57:10.150 --> 00:57:10.983
I don't really want to,

2244
00:57:11.550 --> 00:57:12.190
but if you're lying,

2245
00:57:12.190 --> 00:57:13.023
I'm confused.

2246
00:57:13.060 --> 00:57:13.540
Sorry.

2247
00:57:13.540 --> 00:57:13.820
Yeah,

2248
00:57:13.820 --> 00:57:15.880
he keeps interrupting cause you're lying on your back.

2249
00:57:16.160 --> 00:57:16.931
You're looking up,

2250
00:57:16.931 --> 00:57:17.201
right.

2251
00:57:17.201 --> 00:57:17.981
What difference does it make?

2252
00:57:17.981 --> 00:57:18.814
What's behind you?

2253
00:57:18.850 --> 00:57:19.683
You're not going to see that.

2254
00:57:19.690 --> 00:57:20.080
Well,

2255
00:57:20.080 --> 00:57:21.760
you want to know that it's not.

2256
00:57:21.790 --> 00:57:23.410
It's something because then you're flying,

2257
00:57:23.440 --> 00:57:24.280
you're suspended,

2258
00:57:24.430 --> 00:57:25.263
you look around,

2259
00:57:25.360 --> 00:57:26.230
you're in the air.

2260
00:57:26.350 --> 00:57:27.970
I mean underneath you is cool too.

2261
00:57:28.180 --> 00:57:30.310
If you can have the whole thing and compass,

2262
00:57:30.311 --> 00:57:33.000
then you wind up looking up.

2263
00:57:33.160 --> 00:57:33.820
But you can't.

2264
00:57:33.820 --> 00:57:35.440
When you're aligned back like that,

2265
00:57:35.441 --> 00:57:37.000
you don't know which way is up or down.

2266
00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:37.570
No,

2267
00:57:37.570 --> 00:57:38.320
you would be,

2268
00:57:38.320 --> 00:57:42.910
it would make you think that you're on your stomach looking up at what's,

2269
00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:43.470
you know,

2270
00:57:43.470 --> 00:57:45.970
I mean looking down that what's actually up.

2271
00:57:45.971 --> 00:57:46.540
You don't,

2272
00:57:46.540 --> 00:57:47.800
your mind is twisted.

2273
00:57:47.801 --> 00:57:48.520
When it twists,

2274
00:57:48.520 --> 00:57:49.870
you have no reference.

2275
00:57:50.170 --> 00:57:51.640
So when the move you in there,

2276
00:57:51.641 --> 00:57:54.550
you are under the impression that's the position you're in.

2277
00:57:54.640 --> 00:57:54.791
Well,

2278
00:57:54.791 --> 00:57:57.700
sometimes I don't know where I'm at when I'm in the tank,

2279
00:57:57.701 --> 00:57:59.260
when I sort of snap out of it.

2280
00:57:59.290 --> 00:57:59.920
Did you ever move?

2281
00:57:59.920 --> 00:58:01.840
I don't even know where my feet are facing.

2282
00:58:01.870 --> 00:58:05.080
That's the bottom ever fallen out or anything like that where you take off any

2283
00:58:05.081 --> 00:58:05.801
which way or anything.

2284
00:58:05.801 --> 00:58:06.070
But yeah,

2285
00:58:06.070 --> 00:58:09.160
you feel like you're flying through space so you know that kind of stuff.

2286
00:58:09.161 --> 00:58:11.270
It's like freaky be can't tell people about it because they're going,

2287
00:58:12.400 --> 00:58:12.630
hey,

2288
00:58:12.630 --> 00:58:13.940
10 well you do it.

2289
00:58:14.710 --> 00:58:18.670
I think they froze me out because I used to talk too much about stuff.

2290
00:58:18.700 --> 00:58:19.930
That was probably those.

2291
00:58:20.050 --> 00:58:20.710
Who's they?

2292
00:58:20.710 --> 00:58:21.550
I don't know who they are.

2293
00:58:21.610 --> 00:58:22.750
The fucking government man.

2294
00:58:23.580 --> 00:58:24.460
Every 51 I,

2295
00:58:24.461 --> 00:58:25.960
those guys don't have nothing to do with me.

2296
00:58:25.961 --> 00:58:26.080
I,

2297
00:58:26.080 --> 00:58:27.340
I'm more of a GSA,

2298
00:58:27.460 --> 00:58:28.061
but they're controlling.

2299
00:58:28.061 --> 00:58:28.894
You would chem trails,

2300
00:58:29.390 --> 00:58:31.820
spraying it in the sky box up there.

2301
00:58:31.821 --> 00:58:33.550
It's dripping down and then nano stuff now.

2302
00:58:33.551 --> 00:58:33.901
That's what,

2303
00:58:33.901 --> 00:58:34.510
weird stuff,

2304
00:58:34.510 --> 00:58:34.760
Huh?

2305
00:58:34.760 --> 00:58:35.740
Oh we won't go there.

2306
00:58:35.800 --> 00:58:36.633
Don't go there.

2307
00:58:37.250 --> 00:58:39.370
The thing has to do with the audio.

2308
00:58:39.371 --> 00:58:42.040
Mostly the audio is what's the yes.

2309
00:58:42.041 --> 00:58:45.310
And the audio actually made you at some demonstrations where it made the water

2310
00:58:45.311 --> 00:58:45.760
moves.

2311
00:58:45.760 --> 00:58:45.911
Oh,

2312
00:58:45.911 --> 00:58:46.810
the water's moving.

2313
00:58:46.811 --> 00:58:48.340
I said SIGNMADEK frequencies,

2314
00:58:48.341 --> 00:58:50.830
we've figured out how to them to create the patterns of sound.

2315
00:58:50.831 --> 00:58:53.080
See were made out of a frequency based material.

2316
00:58:53.110 --> 00:58:53.801
Maybe you bro,

2317
00:58:53.801 --> 00:58:56.920
I made a twisted steel sex appeal.

2318
00:58:56.980 --> 00:59:00.700
Is there as an audit file made out frequencies?

2319
00:59:00.701 --> 00:59:02.320
Like what do you mean c based materials?

2320
00:59:02.350 --> 00:59:02.951
Everything is,

2321
00:59:02.951 --> 00:59:03.610
it's moving.

2322
00:59:03.610 --> 00:59:05.440
Oh you mean like string every,

2323
00:59:05.470 --> 00:59:10.390
the idea of everything moving at a different vibration is comprised of materials

2324
00:59:10.391 --> 00:59:11.010
then that are,

2325
00:59:11.010 --> 00:59:11.843
you know,

2326
00:59:12.190 --> 00:59:12.960
unique.

2327
00:59:12.960 --> 00:59:14.920
Like your liver is different than your,

2328
00:59:14.921 --> 00:59:15.310
uh,

2329
00:59:15.310 --> 00:59:16.210
your kidney,

2330
00:59:16.240 --> 00:59:16.550
you know,

2331
00:59:16.550 --> 00:59:20.440
the frequency of that deliver or the material that the kidneys made out of.

2332
00:59:20.470 --> 00:59:21.080
It'd be different.

2333
00:59:21.080 --> 00:59:22.130
So the cells then

2334
00:59:22.580 --> 00:59:23.271
<v 1>that would be,</v>

2335
00:59:23.271 --> 00:59:23.810
uh,

2336
00:59:23.810 --> 00:59:25.400
used for these purposes would,

2337
00:59:26.030 --> 00:59:26.631
if you could,

2338
00:59:26.631 --> 00:59:27.464
uh,

2339
00:59:27.620 --> 00:59:28.401
see what they tell you,

2340
00:59:28.401 --> 00:59:32.270
is that the replication of the cell crazy depreciated version in other words,

2341
00:59:32.271 --> 00:59:33.340
as you chosen,

2342
00:59:33.370 --> 00:59:33.580
right?

2343
00:59:33.580 --> 00:59:34.040
Yeah.

2344
00:59:34.040 --> 00:59:34.340
Right.

2345
00:59:34.340 --> 00:59:34.760
Exactly.

2346
00:59:34.760 --> 00:59:35.090
Okay.

2347
00:59:35.090 --> 00:59:35.840
Well,

2348
00:59:35.840 --> 00:59:38.780
what if instead of a depreciated version of the previous one,

2349
00:59:38.810 --> 00:59:39.770
what if you did better?

2350
00:59:40.040 --> 00:59:42.930
What if you created a cell that was a better why?

2351
00:59:43.080 --> 00:59:43.791
Why wouldn't you,

2352
00:59:43.791 --> 00:59:46.010
if you already understood that?

2353
00:59:46.370 --> 00:59:46.761
Well,

2354
00:59:46.761 --> 00:59:48.080
this is going to be a tool.

2355
00:59:48.081 --> 00:59:51.440
We have the sensors now see I was talking about the brain thing that Germans are

2356
00:59:51.441 --> 00:59:52.400
getting me with a cap.

2357
00:59:52.401 --> 00:59:53.300
That was the neurons,

2358
00:59:53.301 --> 00:59:53.941
the brain thing.

2359
00:59:53.941 --> 00:59:55.880
But there's a cap that has the electrodes on it.

2360
00:59:55.910 --> 00:59:57.710
Like a swimming cap.

2361
00:59:57.740 --> 00:59:58.041
Well,

2362
00:59:58.041 --> 00:59:58.291
it's,

2363
00:59:58.291 --> 00:59:59.630
it's not diving camp.

2364
00:59:59.690 --> 01:00:00.200
Nope.

2365
01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:01.430
It's got electrodes on it.

2366
01:00:01.431 --> 01:00:02.930
It's a cap that goes on in your head.

2367
01:00:02.980 --> 01:00:03.300
Okay.

2368
01:00:03.300 --> 01:00:04.520
They haven't built it for me yet,

2369
01:00:04.521 --> 01:00:07.430
but I've discussed it with them and they understand that they can do it based on

2370
01:00:07.431 --> 01:00:09.410
some testing they've done in a bathtub somewhere.

2371
01:00:09.411 --> 01:00:10.370
But the,

2372
01:00:10.371 --> 01:00:10.641
uh,

2373
01:00:10.641 --> 01:00:11.570
these sensors,

2374
01:00:11.571 --> 01:00:13.460
then you see as they're connected to you,

2375
01:00:13.790 --> 01:00:15.050
you input information.

2376
01:00:15.051 --> 01:00:17.090
See that's the other thing is a sensory of,

2377
01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:21.980
of what's going out and what's going into you and then monitoring what occurs

2378
01:00:21.981 --> 01:00:23.120
based on this input.

2379
01:00:23.690 --> 01:00:23.900
It's,

2380
01:00:23.900 --> 01:00:25.790
this is what that thing is all about.

2381
01:00:25.791 --> 01:00:26.121
But you know,

2382
01:00:26.121 --> 01:00:28.550
I didn't want to get too deep into it cause it's kind of like in the future

2383
01:00:28.551 --> 01:00:29.384
right now.

2384
01:00:29.510 --> 01:00:30.343
And then

2385
01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:35.360
<v 2>Diaz to combined sound with images to essentially tune your body to a different</v>

2386
01:00:35.851 --> 01:00:40.851
frequency and that could potentially change the way your body produces cells.

2387
01:00:42.540 --> 01:00:43.231
<v 1>Absolutely.</v>

2388
01:00:43.231 --> 01:00:45.080
That's a Whoa,

2389
01:00:45.120 --> 01:00:45.400
yeah.

2390
01:00:45.400 --> 01:00:47.400
Interesting analogy of the situation.

2391
01:00:47.401 --> 01:00:48.330
But indeed,

2392
01:00:48.331 --> 01:00:48.900
uh,

2393
01:00:48.900 --> 01:00:51.610
there is a lot of evidence to a,

2394
01:00:51.640 --> 01:00:52.473
you know,

2395
01:00:53.710 --> 01:00:55.540
<v 2>and the mind and the effect on the mind,</v>

2396
01:00:55.541 --> 01:00:58.780
the physical effect on the brain and that what is meditation?

2397
01:00:58.781 --> 01:01:01.090
It's tuning into a certain type of frequency.

2398
01:01:01.360 --> 01:01:06.250
I turn a certain type of mindset turning into a certain mentality,

2399
01:01:06.251 --> 01:01:08.770
tuning into a certain energy that the mind is,

2400
01:01:08.771 --> 01:01:13.510
is focused on and that that actually has a profound effect on the brain itself.

2401
01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:15.250
That's pretty interesting stuff.

2402
01:01:15.280 --> 01:01:15.371
Oh,

2403
01:01:15.371 --> 01:01:16.150
super interesting.

2404
01:01:16.150 --> 01:01:20.260
So that makes something like what you're saying actually viable.

2405
01:01:20.460 --> 01:01:20.990
<v 1>Oh yeah.</v>

2406
01:01:20.990 --> 01:01:24.090
Now that we have a group of people that are willing to,

2407
01:01:24.091 --> 01:01:24.924
uh,

2408
01:01:25.020 --> 01:01:26.220
give us the money for that,

2409
01:01:26.280 --> 01:01:26.520
you know,

2410
01:01:26.520 --> 01:01:26.851
that's,

2411
01:01:26.851 --> 01:01:27.510
uh,

2412
01:01:27.510 --> 01:01:30.300
we have the resources now to complete that,

2413
01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:30.720
you know,

2414
01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:31.920
in some sort of period of time.

2415
01:01:31.921 --> 01:01:32.281
Once we,

2416
01:01:32.281 --> 01:01:32.910
uh,

2417
01:01:32.910 --> 01:01:33.870
focus back to it,

2418
01:01:33.900 --> 01:01:36.420
we've been trying to get this other stuff done so then we could get back to this

2419
01:01:36.421 --> 01:01:36.751
stuff.

2420
01:01:36.751 --> 01:01:41.751
But that technology that we've built and patented as well is extraordinary.

2421
01:01:42.570 --> 01:01:43.050
And that,

2422
01:01:43.050 --> 01:01:44.730
that takes this thing to another level.

2423
01:01:44.731 --> 01:01:45.001
I mean,

2424
01:01:45.001 --> 01:01:47.400
this is what it is and that's why it's so important as well.

2425
01:01:47.760 --> 01:01:49.710
These vehicles that we're producing now,

2426
01:01:50.070 --> 01:01:53.370
not only will they be used for this,

2427
01:01:53.371 --> 01:01:54.090
uh,

2428
01:01:54.090 --> 01:01:54.480
you know,

2429
01:01:54.480 --> 01:01:55.260
uh,

2430
01:01:55.260 --> 01:01:59.340
stuff that we've been talking about here in regards to the relaxation and so

2431
01:01:59.341 --> 01:02:00.174
forth else.

2432
01:02:00.390 --> 01:02:03.090
It will eventually in the future be used also for,

2433
01:02:03.091 --> 01:02:03.240
uh,

2434
01:02:03.240 --> 01:02:03.421
you know,

2435
01:02:03.421 --> 01:02:04.740
other health benefits and,

2436
01:02:04.741 --> 01:02:05.550
uh,

2437
01:02:05.550 --> 01:02:06.420
learning and,

2438
01:02:06.450 --> 01:02:07.283
uh,

2439
01:02:08.190 --> 01:02:08.910
uh,

2440
01:02:08.910 --> 01:02:10.020
a whole array of,

2441
01:02:10.021 --> 01:02:10.854
uh,

2442
01:02:10.950 --> 01:02:11.671
various,

2443
01:02:11.671 --> 01:02:12.504
uh,

2444
01:02:13.270 --> 01:02:14.103
uh,

2445
01:02:14.130 --> 01:02:17.000
positive features that this thing is the benefits of.

2446
01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:18.610
It absolutely influenced the,

2447
01:02:18.611 --> 01:02:19.230
the,

2448
01:02:19.230 --> 01:02:19.940
the human,

2449
01:02:19.940 --> 01:02:20.230
uh,

2450
01:02:20.230 --> 01:02:20.850
uh,

2451
01:02:20.850 --> 01:02:23.730
and to be used in conjunction with a lot of other things in your life,

2452
01:02:23.940 --> 01:02:24.870
proper diet,

2453
01:02:24.900 --> 01:02:25.770
exercise,

2454
01:02:25.771 --> 01:02:26.640
meditation,

2455
01:02:26.641 --> 01:02:29.710
all these things just started to lutely that is this,

2456
01:02:29.820 --> 01:02:30.653
there is no,

2457
01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:30.990
they say,

2458
01:02:30.990 --> 01:02:31.141
oh,

2459
01:02:31.141 --> 01:02:31.974
this silver bullet.

2460
01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:32.851
It's a,

2461
01:02:32.851 --> 01:02:33.391
it's a,

2462
01:02:33.391 --> 01:02:34.110
uh,

2463
01:02:34.110 --> 01:02:35.520
con like you have to get,

2464
01:02:35.550 --> 01:02:36.383
you should be,

2465
01:02:36.840 --> 01:02:38.880
everything is important.

2466
01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:39.870
Food,

2467
01:02:39.870 --> 01:02:40.591
your intake,

2468
01:02:40.591 --> 01:02:41.520
their mind,

2469
01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:42.301
your,

2470
01:02:42.301 --> 01:02:43.680
your rest or whatever it is.

2471
01:02:43.681 --> 01:02:44.281
It's all like that.

2472
01:02:44.281 --> 01:02:45.360
If you could get yourself,

2473
01:02:45.600 --> 01:02:45.931
you know,

2474
01:02:45.931 --> 01:02:47.670
balanced out and,

2475
01:02:47.671 --> 01:02:48.120
uh,

2476
01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:50.940
we have a lot of room for growth and you know,

2477
01:02:50.941 --> 01:02:51.331
like I said,

2478
01:02:51.331 --> 01:02:52.890
we're just getting started as a,

2479
01:02:53.340 --> 01:02:54.131
I think that the,

2480
01:02:54.131 --> 01:02:55.380
the species itself,

2481
01:02:55.420 --> 01:02:55.960
uh,

2482
01:02:55.960 --> 01:02:57.210
humans that we are,

2483
01:02:57.630 --> 01:02:58.170
uh,

2484
01:02:58.170 --> 01:03:02.250
are just starting to understand a little bit about what we are.

2485
01:03:02.520 --> 01:03:03.970
We don't know where we came from.

2486
01:03:03.971 --> 01:03:04.804
It's a very good point.

2487
01:03:04.980 --> 01:03:05.420
Yeah.

2488
01:03:05.420 --> 01:03:05.970
Yeah.

2489
01:03:05.970 --> 01:03:06.803
<v 2>Starting to understand.</v>

2490
01:03:06.990 --> 01:03:09.860
We'd discussed it in the previous podcast about the,

2491
01:03:09.890 --> 01:03:10.410
just the,

2492
01:03:10.410 --> 01:03:12.510
just the couple of generations between us,

2493
01:03:12.750 --> 01:03:15.720
the people that lived in the 1940s during World War One,

2494
01:03:16.200 --> 01:03:18.390
world war two rather than dropping in the first atomic bomb.

2495
01:03:18.540 --> 01:03:20.220
And then the people before that,

2496
01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:21.930
they in the 18 hundreds,

2497
01:03:21.931 --> 01:03:23.160
it's just a few generations.

2498
01:03:23.161 --> 01:03:24.410
You just dealing with a few seconds

2499
01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:26.510
<v 1>now how this retina works,</v>

2500
01:03:26.570 --> 01:03:28.040
you've seen this in the back of the head.

2501
01:03:28.041 --> 01:03:29.540
It's in the dark or the eyes.

2502
01:03:29.541 --> 01:03:33.380
They changed it around the information somehow and it comes out there and then

2503
01:03:33.381 --> 01:03:36.800
you think it's out there when it somehow back in here being interpretated.

2504
01:03:36.860 --> 01:03:37.101
<v 2>Well,</v>

2505
01:03:37.101 --> 01:03:39.080
what we were talking about earlier with meditation,

2506
01:03:39.081 --> 01:03:39.914
there's a study,

2507
01:03:40.070 --> 01:03:40.830
um,

2508
01:03:40.830 --> 01:03:41.331
if you,

2509
01:03:41.331 --> 01:03:41.750
uh,

2510
01:03:41.750 --> 01:03:44.330
if you Google how meditation changes your brain.

2511
01:03:44.420 --> 01:03:46.280
A neuroscientist explains,

2512
01:03:46.310 --> 01:03:47.143
there was a,

2513
01:03:47.180 --> 01:03:49.550
a group of Harvard neuroscientist led bar.

2514
01:03:49.551 --> 01:03:51.390
This woman Sarah Liz are,

2515
01:03:51.570 --> 01:03:53.270
who's a phd and they,

2516
01:03:53.271 --> 01:03:53.780
uh,

2517
01:03:53.780 --> 01:03:57.830
they were interested in mindfulness meditation and they reported that the brain

2518
01:03:57.831 --> 01:03:58.401
structures,

2519
01:03:58.401 --> 01:04:02.180
they monitored brain structures change after only eight weeks of meditation

2520
01:04:02.181 --> 01:04:02.930
practice,

2521
01:04:02.930 --> 01:04:04.430
eight weeks of meditation practice.

2522
01:04:04.431 --> 01:04:06.890
And your brain starts branching out in a different way.

2523
01:04:06.891 --> 01:04:09.500
It starts truly expanding your consciousness.

2524
01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:12.530
You think of expanding your consciousness being some sort of an airy fairy

2525
01:04:12.531 --> 01:04:13.040
thing.

2526
01:04:13.040 --> 01:04:13.191
Well,

2527
01:04:13.191 --> 01:04:13.311
no,

2528
01:04:13.311 --> 01:04:14.250
it's measurable.

2529
01:04:14.620 --> 01:04:16.960
It's expanding your mind itself.

2530
01:04:16.961 --> 01:04:18.980
What is more important than this?

2531
01:04:19.130 --> 01:04:19.963
I don't think there's anything more.

2532
01:04:20.210 --> 01:04:20.580
<v 1>I mean,</v>

2533
01:04:20.580 --> 01:04:20.870
I,

2534
01:04:20.870 --> 01:04:21.240
I,

2535
01:04:21.240 --> 01:04:22.230
it is the,

2536
01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:25.040
it's the premier opportunity yeah.

2537
01:04:25.070 --> 01:04:25.430
To,

2538
01:04:25.430 --> 01:04:25.910
to,

2539
01:04:25.910 --> 01:04:27.710
to do something for yourself.

2540
01:04:28.040 --> 01:04:29.540
<v 2>And if you can expand your mind,</v>

2541
01:04:29.570 --> 01:04:30.201
believe me,

2542
01:04:30.201 --> 01:04:31.490
all these people that are trying this,

2543
01:04:31.670 --> 01:04:32.870
if they tried it in a tank,

2544
01:04:32.900 --> 01:04:33.470
it would be,

2545
01:04:33.470 --> 01:04:33.741
oh,

2546
01:04:33.741 --> 01:04:35.360
so much more effective.

2547
01:04:35.720 --> 01:04:36.031
It's a,

2548
01:04:36.031 --> 01:04:36.370
it's,

2549
01:04:36.370 --> 01:04:36.770
it's,

2550
01:04:36.770 --> 01:04:38.450
it takes so much.

2551
01:04:38.480 --> 01:04:39.313
It's like,

2552
01:04:39.470 --> 01:04:39.801
you know,

2553
01:04:39.801 --> 01:04:40.670
can you,

2554
01:04:40.700 --> 01:04:41.450
uh,

2555
01:04:41.450 --> 01:04:41.961
you know,

2556
01:04:41.961 --> 01:04:45.170
can you get across the country a riding a bike?

2557
01:04:45.171 --> 01:04:46.040
You certainly can.

2558
01:04:46.220 --> 01:04:48.170
Can you get across faster if you ride a plane?

2559
01:04:48.320 --> 01:04:49.340
Fuck yeah.

2560
01:04:49.610 --> 01:04:50.061
Okay.

2561
01:04:50.061 --> 01:04:51.080
And this is the difference.

2562
01:04:51.081 --> 01:04:52.520
It's like you can get there on a bike.

2563
01:04:52.550 --> 01:04:53.480
You certainly can.

2564
01:04:53.481 --> 01:04:54.314
Good luck.

2565
01:04:54.470 --> 01:04:54.851
Good luck.

2566
01:04:54.851 --> 01:04:56.330
Call it techno shamanism,

2567
01:04:58.290 --> 01:04:59.123
<v 1>you know,</v>

2568
01:04:59.450 --> 01:05:00.740
technology to,

2569
01:05:00.800 --> 01:05:01.170
to,

2570
01:05:01.170 --> 01:05:03.180
to create these monks.

2571
01:05:03.181 --> 01:05:05.310
They're out there trying to get these two levels.

2572
01:05:05.670 --> 01:05:09.840
Is that 20 years in a side of a mountain meditating or you could go jump in a

2573
01:05:09.841 --> 01:05:12.040
chamber and get yourself sorted out and uh,

2574
01:05:12.060 --> 01:05:14.070
you know much faster.

2575
01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:14.251
Well,

2576
01:05:14.251 --> 01:05:14.461
yeah,

2577
01:05:14.461 --> 01:05:15.650
I mean I would like to see,

2578
01:05:15.651 --> 01:05:15.730
see

2579
01:05:15.730 --> 01:05:19.480
<v 2>what those coons Daleney masters when they hit that highest level because I do</v>

2580
01:05:19.481 --> 01:05:21.370
believe that they can achieve psychedelic states.

2581
01:05:23.720 --> 01:05:24.130
Oh No,

2582
01:05:24.130 --> 01:05:25.240
I couldn't lean people.

2583
01:05:25.241 --> 01:05:26.051
I don't know they are,

2584
01:05:26.051 --> 01:05:30.040
but there's some of those monks up there and these monasteries or wherever

2585
01:05:30.041 --> 01:05:30.850
they're at,

2586
01:05:30.850 --> 01:05:33.490
they use these frequencies that they produce with their,

2587
01:05:33.491 --> 01:05:33.910
uh,

2588
01:05:33.910 --> 01:05:36.140
their routes and stuff to affect them somehow.

2589
01:05:36.390 --> 01:05:37.870
Duncan Trussell knows how to do that.

2590
01:05:37.871 --> 01:05:38.141
He'll,

2591
01:05:38.141 --> 01:05:38.471
he'll,

2592
01:05:38.471 --> 01:05:39.670
he can do those chants.

2593
01:05:39.671 --> 01:05:40.840
Let's crazy Buddhist chance.

2594
01:05:40.841 --> 01:05:41.740
He has a memorize.

2595
01:05:41.741 --> 01:05:43.690
It's very freaky when he starts doing it.

2596
01:05:43.840 --> 01:05:45.100
Does it take a man just some wire?

2597
01:05:45.101 --> 01:05:46.540
Does he go on his mind?

2598
01:05:47.410 --> 01:05:48.460
He also,

2599
01:05:48.461 --> 01:05:53.461
the freeing aspect of chanting and just the harmonizing and sang all those

2600
01:05:53.501 --> 01:05:54.071
things.

2601
01:05:54.071 --> 01:05:56.450
He just sort of like get into this state of mind.

2602
01:05:56.640 --> 01:05:57.401
It puts you into,

2603
01:05:57.401 --> 01:05:58.810
this is vibe.

2604
01:05:59.390 --> 01:06:03.850
Dunkin benefited tremendously from the tank though docking is been my friend for

2605
01:06:03.851 --> 01:06:04.481
a long time.

2606
01:06:04.481 --> 01:06:09.481
And one time way in the past he had a bad breakup called me up from a hotel.

2607
01:06:11.740 --> 01:06:13.390
He was at some a hotel.

2608
01:06:13.391 --> 01:06:13.721
He's like,

2609
01:06:13.721 --> 01:06:14.231
dude,

2610
01:06:14.231 --> 01:06:14.471
you know,

2611
01:06:14.471 --> 01:06:15.760
my girlfriend just kicked me out.

2612
01:06:15.761 --> 01:06:18.040
We had this horrible breakup but just went awful.

2613
01:06:18.041 --> 01:06:19.030
And I'm like,

2614
01:06:19.090 --> 01:06:19.871
he was living with her.

2615
01:06:19.871 --> 01:06:20.141
He's like,

2616
01:06:20.141 --> 01:06:21.190
I'm literally homeless.

2617
01:06:21.550 --> 01:06:22.001
And I said,

2618
01:06:22.001 --> 01:06:22.420
hey,

2619
01:06:22.420 --> 01:06:23.410
come live with me.

2620
01:06:23.500 --> 01:06:24.610
I kind of an extra bedroom.

2621
01:06:24.730 --> 01:06:29.170
So Dunkin came and lived with me and was going into the tank that you designed

2622
01:06:29.500 --> 01:06:30.760
and he would go in the tank every day.

2623
01:06:30.761 --> 01:06:31.900
He lived with me for like

2624
01:06:33.880 --> 01:06:34.511
a few months,

2625
01:06:34.511 --> 01:06:35.171
I don't know how many,

2626
01:06:35.171 --> 01:06:36.010
maybe four or five.

2627
01:06:36.011 --> 01:06:38.440
I don't remember totally until he got back on his feet again.

2628
01:06:38.441 --> 01:06:42.160
But he sorted everything out in that tank and he would tell me about it.

2629
01:06:42.161 --> 01:06:42.671
He was like,

2630
01:06:42.671 --> 01:06:43.504
dude,

2631
01:06:43.510 --> 01:06:43.811
he goes,

2632
01:06:43.811 --> 01:06:45.190
I just can't wait to get back in that tank.

2633
01:06:45.191 --> 01:06:48.280
And every day I just get in that tank and I'm figuring it out more and more.

2634
01:06:48.460 --> 01:06:49.720
He's figuring it out.

2635
01:06:50.170 --> 01:06:52.750
He's not reading what they have bad or is it,

2636
01:06:52.751 --> 01:06:55.480
it goes in there and it figures it out.

2637
01:06:55.600 --> 01:07:00.160
I've never met a guy who got his shit in order quicker back,

2638
01:07:00.220 --> 01:07:03.120
quicker than from a devastating breakup.

2639
01:07:03.300 --> 01:07:06.330
Then Dunkin did was willing to go in there and,

2640
01:07:06.331 --> 01:07:06.600
and,

2641
01:07:06.600 --> 01:07:09.250
and do the work required to get done with that.

2642
01:07:09.460 --> 01:07:11.380
He also realized what had gone wrong,

2643
01:07:11.381 --> 01:07:15.850
like really quickly instead of like wallowing in his own self pity or trying to

2644
01:07:15.880 --> 01:07:18.970
distort reality to sort of,

2645
01:07:18.971 --> 01:07:19.804
um,

2646
01:07:20.050 --> 01:07:23.170
just sort of be more easily digestible.

2647
01:07:23.200 --> 01:07:23.531
You know,

2648
01:07:23.531 --> 01:07:24.490
like that was all her,

2649
01:07:24.491 --> 01:07:25.324
she's crazy.

2650
01:07:26.380 --> 01:07:28.020
He saw the whole thing on it.

2651
01:07:28.210 --> 01:07:29.360
He didn't put any twist on it.

2652
01:07:29.370 --> 01:07:32.110
She lost his part in it as well as the other one.

2653
01:07:32.860 --> 01:07:35.980
And then from then he went on to become a successful comedian.

2654
01:07:35.981 --> 01:07:36.101
I mean,

2655
01:07:36.101 --> 01:07:36.671
it's crazy.

2656
01:07:36.671 --> 01:07:38.620
It's just like a slow build from there.

2657
01:07:38.830 --> 01:07:39.460
He caught,

2658
01:07:39.460 --> 01:07:40.450
caught that momentum,

2659
01:07:40.451 --> 01:07:40.751
but it was,

2660
01:07:40.751 --> 01:07:42.730
a lot of it was based on doing,

2661
01:07:42.731 --> 01:07:44.110
going that in that tank,

2662
01:07:44.560 --> 01:07:46.420
having those experiences on a daily basis.

2663
01:07:47.240 --> 01:07:47.510
It's,

2664
01:07:47.510 --> 01:07:47.890
it's a,

2665
01:07:47.890 --> 01:07:51.970
it's a fantastic a system for people to then,

2666
01:07:51.971 --> 01:07:52.804
uh,

2667
01:07:53.320 --> 01:07:53.620
you know,

2668
01:07:53.620 --> 01:07:54.700
access themselves.

2669
01:07:54.820 --> 01:07:55.653
Yeah.

2670
01:07:55.730 --> 01:07:56.110
That,

2671
01:07:56.110 --> 01:07:56.351
you know,

2672
01:07:56.351 --> 01:07:56.551
the,

2673
01:07:56.551 --> 01:07:57.430
the rest of it is,

2674
01:07:57.431 --> 01:07:57.911
you know,

2675
01:07:57.911 --> 01:07:58.271
it's,

2676
01:07:58.271 --> 01:07:58.451
it's,

2677
01:07:58.451 --> 01:07:59.284
uh,

2678
01:07:59.410 --> 01:08:00.243
it's a crapshoot.

2679
01:08:00.250 --> 01:08:02.350
You really never know what you're going to run into in there,

2680
01:08:02.740 --> 01:08:07.740
but you do always have that opportunity to look at yourself and you know,

2681
01:08:09.880 --> 01:08:11.260
and sometimes I don't even do that.

2682
01:08:11.410 --> 01:08:13.300
Sometimes I just relax.

2683
01:08:13.480 --> 01:08:15.320
Sometimes there are times where like,

2684
01:08:15.321 --> 01:08:15.560
you know,

2685
01:08:15.560 --> 01:08:19.850
I'll come home and maybe I'll come home from a show and everyone's asleep and I

2686
01:08:19.851 --> 01:08:20.131
say,

2687
01:08:20.131 --> 01:08:20.261
yeah,

2688
01:08:20.261 --> 01:08:22.910
I just need to go in there and chill for a bit and I'll just go in there and

2689
01:08:22.911 --> 01:08:23.481
just chill.

2690
01:08:23.481 --> 01:08:24.200
Like I'm done.

2691
01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:24.831
I'm tired.

2692
01:08:24.831 --> 01:08:25.550
I did work,

2693
01:08:25.550 --> 01:08:26.720
I did shows,

2694
01:08:26.721 --> 01:08:27.250
I,

2695
01:08:27.250 --> 01:08:28.910
I did a podcast,

2696
01:08:28.911 --> 01:08:31.610
I did some writing and maybe even worked out already too.

2697
01:08:31.611 --> 01:08:33.130
I don't have nothing to think about.

2698
01:08:33.150 --> 01:08:34.490
I just want to chill.

2699
01:08:34.910 --> 01:08:36.190
And so I go in there and it just,

2700
01:08:36.340 --> 01:08:37.173
uh,

2701
01:08:38.690 --> 01:08:41.560
just took out loading man less this,

2702
01:08:41.660 --> 01:08:41.981
the,

2703
01:08:41.981 --> 01:08:43.520
the lightening of the load,

2704
01:08:43.521 --> 01:08:45.770
the releasing of all those muscles and the,

2705
01:08:46.370 --> 01:08:48.590
I get out of there and I feel so good.

2706
01:08:48.710 --> 01:08:50.960
I feel so like calm and chill.

2707
01:08:51.210 --> 01:08:52.460
So important man.

2708
01:08:52.640 --> 01:08:53.630
It should be everywhere.

2709
01:08:53.631 --> 01:08:54.464
They should have him.

2710
01:08:54.530 --> 01:08:55.700
Every gym should have,

2711
01:08:55.701 --> 01:08:56.090
um,

2712
01:08:56.090 --> 01:08:57.470
community centers should have,

2713
01:08:57.471 --> 01:08:58.670
I'm school should have them,

2714
01:08:58.671 --> 01:09:00.020
university should have him.

2715
01:09:00.410 --> 01:09:02.590
It should be just as important as having a basketball court.

2716
01:09:02.591 --> 01:09:04.280
You got a basketball court but you don't have a tank.

2717
01:09:04.310 --> 01:09:05.220
The fuck you guys cry.

2718
01:09:05.230 --> 01:09:06.350
You teaching people shit.

2719
01:09:06.800 --> 01:09:07.340
You know,

2720
01:09:07.340 --> 01:09:09.800
you need to get a God damn tank room son.

2721
01:09:10.580 --> 01:09:10.731
<v 1>Well,</v>

2722
01:09:10.731 --> 01:09:11.161
we're going to go,

2723
01:09:11.161 --> 01:09:11.570
uh,

2724
01:09:11.570 --> 01:09:14.720
I think that we're going to do what we can do to make that all happen.

2725
01:09:14.721 --> 01:09:14.961
You know,

2726
01:09:14.961 --> 01:09:16.850
these schools and stuff that these kids are at.

2727
01:09:17.270 --> 01:09:17.811
Once again,

2728
01:09:17.811 --> 01:09:18.644
uh,

2729
01:09:18.650 --> 01:09:19.483
you know,

2730
01:09:19.500 --> 01:09:20.090
if,

2731
01:09:20.090 --> 01:09:22.970
if things go the way that we hope they go,

2732
01:09:22.971 --> 01:09:23.804
uh,

2733
01:09:23.810 --> 01:09:28.810
we're all about providing these vehicles for a schools and,

2734
01:09:30.020 --> 01:09:30.853
uh,

2735
01:09:30.920 --> 01:09:31.610
you know,

2736
01:09:31.610 --> 01:09:36.110
old people are veterans or these veterans get a lot of benefit out of this tier.

2737
01:09:36.111 --> 01:09:37.220
They get that PSD,

2738
01:09:37.221 --> 01:09:38.054
whatever it is,

2739
01:09:38.400 --> 01:09:39.950
was traumatic stress disorder.

2740
01:09:40.470 --> 01:09:43.550
They say that the chamber is the one thing that,

2741
01:09:43.551 --> 01:09:44.240
uh,

2742
01:09:44.240 --> 01:09:45.073
helps them up.

2743
01:09:46.100 --> 01:09:46.933
They're all getting the Kim,

2744
01:09:46.980 --> 01:09:47.290
the,

2745
01:09:47.290 --> 01:09:47.570
you know,

2746
01:09:47.570 --> 01:09:49.820
the medication and so forth.

2747
01:09:49.821 --> 01:09:50.421
But other than that,

2748
01:09:50.421 --> 01:09:51.530
they don't really have a,

2749
01:09:51.920 --> 01:09:52.551
an option,

2750
01:09:52.551 --> 01:09:53.360
you know,

2751
01:09:53.360 --> 01:09:56.000
this is a thing.

2752
01:09:56.001 --> 01:09:56.690
Uh,

2753
01:09:56.690 --> 01:09:59.570
that would be a very,

2754
01:09:59.571 --> 01:09:59.930
uh,

2755
01:09:59.930 --> 01:10:03.410
appropriate to offer these,

2756
01:10:03.470 --> 01:10:03.770
these,

2757
01:10:03.770 --> 01:10:04.603
uh,

2758
01:10:04.770 --> 01:10:06.230
servicemen and women.

2759
01:10:06.340 --> 01:10:10.820
They come back and have troubles dealing with,

2760
01:10:10.821 --> 01:10:11.654
uh,

2761
01:10:11.960 --> 01:10:15.150
the framework of their situation when they get back here a little,

2762
01:10:15.160 --> 01:10:17.690
the opportunity to go in there and investigate the,

2763
01:10:17.691 --> 01:10:18.524
uh,

2764
01:10:19.100 --> 01:10:19.311
you know,

2765
01:10:19.311 --> 01:10:20.390
cause it's already done.

2766
01:10:20.420 --> 01:10:22.730
You can't go in there and erase whatever it was.

2767
01:10:22.731 --> 01:10:23.750
It's bothering you.

2768
01:10:24.110 --> 01:10:28.190
But you could go in there and come to terms with whatever it was realizing it

2769
01:10:28.191 --> 01:10:28.880
is,

2770
01:10:28.880 --> 01:10:29.750
it's done.

2771
01:10:30.320 --> 01:10:31.400
It is what it was.

2772
01:10:31.430 --> 01:10:34.730
Just like any other problem that people go back to.

2773
01:10:34.790 --> 01:10:35.240
I mean,

2774
01:10:35.240 --> 01:10:40.240
at some point it's up to you to release yourself from that obligation to get

2775
01:10:40.641 --> 01:10:45.260
upset or feel bad about something that didn't go right in the past,

2776
01:10:45.261 --> 01:10:45.681
you know?

2777
01:10:45.681 --> 01:10:46.130
And uh,

2778
01:10:46.130 --> 01:10:46.710
that's a huge

2779
01:10:46.710 --> 01:10:50.550
<v 2>point because people define themselves by the past instead of thinking about who</v>

2780
01:10:50.551 --> 01:10:54.660
they are now instead of they still look back at a mistake they made.

2781
01:10:54.661 --> 01:10:56.220
And don't just get past that mistake,

2782
01:10:56.221 --> 01:10:57.090
grow and learn,

2783
01:10:57.270 --> 01:10:58.170
but dwell on it.

2784
01:10:58.340 --> 01:10:59.400
I think it defines them.

2785
01:10:59.620 --> 01:10:59.981
<v 1>They still,</v>

2786
01:10:59.981 --> 01:11:01.780
worst thing I met some guys,

2787
01:11:01.790 --> 01:11:03.390
that band he says is a singers.

2788
01:11:03.670 --> 01:11:04.930
I've only met him twice,

2789
01:11:04.931 --> 01:11:05.720
two different times,

2790
01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:06.580
years later.

2791
01:11:06.910 --> 01:11:07.421
Both Times.

2792
01:11:07.421 --> 01:11:08.890
He started telling me about the story,

2793
01:11:08.891 --> 01:11:10.690
about what happened to him when he was in this.

2794
01:11:11.020 --> 01:11:13.980
Anything in this poor guy has gone on these years

2795
01:11:14.190 --> 01:11:19.050
<v 2>and he's still focused on the worst situation that he ever had to live through.</v>

2796
01:11:19.130 --> 01:11:19.370
Yeah.

2797
01:11:19.370 --> 01:11:21.990
And it's so a attached to it.

2798
01:11:22.110 --> 01:11:22.231
Well,

2799
01:11:22.231 --> 01:11:24.090
some guys get one break up and they're done.

2800
01:11:24.300 --> 01:11:24.901
Some guys,

2801
01:11:24.901 --> 01:11:27.900
one breakup in their twenties will tank them for a decade.

2802
01:11:27.901 --> 01:11:29.520
I've met guys like that that,

2803
01:11:29.540 --> 01:11:29.911
yeah.

2804
01:11:29.911 --> 01:11:31.980
You know what came out here with Sally and you know,

2805
01:11:31.981 --> 01:11:34.830
she fucking fell in love with her trainer and dude,

2806
01:11:34.860 --> 01:11:36.780
Sally still move on.

2807
01:11:37.050 --> 01:11:37.771
What is that?

2808
01:11:37.771 --> 01:11:38.760
And fucking years ago,

2809
01:11:38.790 --> 01:11:39.450
oh,

2810
01:11:39.450 --> 01:11:39.721
well,

2811
01:11:39.721 --> 01:11:40.021
you know,

2812
01:11:40.021 --> 01:11:41.040
changed my life bro.

2813
01:11:41.041 --> 01:11:41.800
But target talk,

2814
01:11:41.800 --> 01:11:43.800
I was so disappointed I can't trust women anymore.

2815
01:11:44.070 --> 01:11:44.581
Oh,

2816
01:11:44.581 --> 01:11:45.121
you stupid.

2817
01:11:45.121 --> 01:11:45.810
Fuck.

2818
01:11:45.810 --> 01:11:49.070
You know what if he got mugged by one person who'd done trusting people.

2819
01:11:49.400 --> 01:11:50.150
Exactly.

2820
01:11:50.150 --> 01:11:50.983
I mean,

2821
01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:52.110
one person was a murderer.

2822
01:11:52.111 --> 01:11:53.040
Let's not trust anybody.

2823
01:11:53.060 --> 01:11:53.191
Yeah.

2824
01:11:53.191 --> 01:11:53.650
Yeah.

2825
01:11:53.650 --> 01:11:54.330
You know,

2826
01:11:54.330 --> 01:11:55.440
I heard about Ted Bundy.

2827
01:11:55.441 --> 01:11:56.520
I'm not trusting people anymore.

2828
01:11:56.670 --> 01:11:56.911
Oh,

2829
01:11:56.911 --> 01:11:57.390
okay,

2830
01:11:57.390 --> 01:11:57.691
great.

2831
01:11:57.691 --> 01:11:58.680
I'm not sleeping tonight.

2832
01:12:00.150 --> 01:12:00.983
We,

2833
01:12:01.110 --> 01:12:01.500
yeah,

2834
01:12:01.500 --> 01:12:03.750
I mean there's definitely pitfalls in life.

2835
01:12:03.780 --> 01:12:04.613
You're going to run into him.

2836
01:12:04.650 --> 01:12:05.340
We all are.

2837
01:12:05.340 --> 01:12:05.620
No,

2838
01:12:05.620 --> 01:12:06.570
you can learn and grow.

2839
01:12:06.571 --> 01:12:07.330
If you survive,

2840
01:12:07.330 --> 01:12:08.370
you pick yourself up,

2841
01:12:08.371 --> 01:12:10.590
you dust the dust off and then you start going,

2842
01:12:10.640 --> 01:12:10.780
yeah,

2843
01:12:10.780 --> 01:12:10.911
no,

2844
01:12:10.911 --> 01:12:11.970
you don't let this stuff.

2845
01:12:11.971 --> 01:12:12.720
Uh,

2846
01:12:12.720 --> 01:12:13.770
don't let it beat you down.

2847
01:12:13.800 --> 01:12:17.400
It's also directly proportionate to the amount of hardships that people face in

2848
01:12:17.401 --> 01:12:17.820
life,

2849
01:12:17.820 --> 01:12:19.290
their ability to face hardships.

2850
01:12:19.560 --> 01:12:19.831
You know,

2851
01:12:19.831 --> 01:12:22.920
and there's a lot of folks that live life on a cushy cloud of marshmallows and

2852
01:12:22.921 --> 01:12:23.610
bullshit.

2853
01:12:23.610 --> 01:12:25.290
And then one day something goes wrong.

2854
01:12:25.500 --> 01:12:25.861
And I mean,

2855
01:12:25.861 --> 01:12:28.500
that's why spoiled kids are so sad.

2856
01:12:28.710 --> 01:12:31.530
Like a spoiled young boy is one of the saddest things ever.

2857
01:12:31.710 --> 01:12:35.640
A young boy that becomes a man and can't take care of himself and his dad has to

2858
01:12:35.641 --> 01:12:36.960
keep on rescuing him.

2859
01:12:37.140 --> 01:12:40.650
His Dad has to keep on bailing them out of situations and giving them money.

2860
01:12:40.650 --> 01:12:44.910
I've met guys like that and that is a crippling affliction when they don't have

2861
01:12:44.911 --> 01:12:47.220
the character themselves to be able to get by in life.

2862
01:12:47.250 --> 01:12:50.670
They constantly need someone to help them and bail them out.

2863
01:12:50.700 --> 01:12:51.840
Even as a grown man,

2864
01:12:52.050 --> 01:12:53.910
I've met guys in their forties,

2865
01:12:53.911 --> 01:12:55.860
it's still need help from their parents.

2866
01:12:56.370 --> 01:12:56.671
I'm like,

2867
01:12:56.671 --> 01:12:57.960
what the fuck man,

2868
01:12:58.230 --> 01:13:02.040
you're never going to get it right because somewhere along the line they didn't

2869
01:13:02.041 --> 01:13:05.430
face enough of the university to realize that there's some times you just got to

2870
01:13:05.431 --> 01:13:06.720
get up and get shit done.

2871
01:13:06.930 --> 01:13:10.920
There's sometimes we have to fucking pull yourself up and you have to push

2872
01:13:10.921 --> 01:13:11.371
forward,

2873
01:13:11.371 --> 01:13:12.630
even if you want to stay in the bed.

2874
01:13:12.930 --> 01:13:15.600
And if you don't do that and you just keep calling on your daddy and your daddy

2875
01:13:15.601 --> 01:13:16.440
keeps rescuing you,

2876
01:13:16.590 --> 01:13:18.150
you never developed those tools.

2877
01:13:18.390 --> 01:13:21.630
You never develop that ability to recognize what you're doing wrong with your

2878
01:13:21.631 --> 01:13:22.740
life because you're,

2879
01:13:22.741 --> 01:13:23.430
you're soft.

2880
01:13:23.430 --> 01:13:24.151
You got to Cushnie,

2881
01:13:24.151 --> 01:13:25.050
you've got a safety net,

2882
01:13:25.051 --> 01:13:26.490
a safety net for your safety net.

2883
01:13:27.120 --> 01:13:28.980
I have this friend and she has this,

2884
01:13:28.981 --> 01:13:29.310
uh,

2885
01:13:29.310 --> 01:13:34.140
this friend that she's been friends with for decades and this poor fuck his

2886
01:13:34.141 --> 01:13:34.641
family,

2887
01:13:34.641 --> 01:13:35.101
super,

2888
01:13:35.101 --> 01:13:35.401
super,

2889
01:13:35.401 --> 01:13:36.121
super wealthy,

2890
01:13:36.121 --> 01:13:37.500
like unbelievable wealthy,

2891
01:13:37.501 --> 01:13:38.640
billions of dollars.

2892
01:13:38.970 --> 01:13:39.900
And he had that,

2893
01:13:39.901 --> 01:13:41.010
not only did he had,

2894
01:13:41.070 --> 01:13:41.490
uh,

2895
01:13:41.490 --> 01:13:44.940
he had a trust fund and a backup trust fund.

2896
01:13:45.450 --> 01:13:48.990
So he blew through the trust fund and then he blew through the backup trust

2897
01:13:48.991 --> 01:13:49.824
fund,

2898
01:13:50.130 --> 01:13:53.460
real estate investments and just disastrous business ventures.

2899
01:13:53.461 --> 01:13:55.320
No character and no discipline,

2900
01:13:55.321 --> 01:13:56.580
no ability to stick it out.

2901
01:13:56.760 --> 01:13:58.470
But incredible amount of resources.

2902
01:13:58.471 --> 01:14:00.060
He had millions and millions of dollars.

2903
01:14:00.061 --> 01:14:01.530
Just pissed it all away,

2904
01:14:01.890 --> 01:14:02.850
didn't understand it,

2905
01:14:02.851 --> 01:14:03.720
completely depressed.

2906
01:14:03.721 --> 01:14:04.800
And one day said to her,

2907
01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:05.640
he said,

2908
01:14:05.640 --> 01:14:05.881
you know,

2909
01:14:05.881 --> 01:14:07.830
cause she has children as well and she has sons.

2910
01:14:08.220 --> 01:14:08.851
He said to her,

2911
01:14:08.851 --> 01:14:09.121
he goes,

2912
01:14:09.121 --> 01:14:09.811
whatever you do,

2913
01:14:09.811 --> 01:14:11.070
do not give your kids money.

2914
01:14:11.170 --> 01:14:12.430
Don't give them a fucking penny.

2915
01:14:12.720 --> 01:14:12.971
He goes,

2916
01:14:12.971 --> 01:14:13.960
especially your boys.

2917
01:14:14.080 --> 01:14:16.120
Don't give him a penny that that ruined me.

2918
01:14:16.330 --> 01:14:17.550
Don't give him money then I was,

2919
01:14:18.230 --> 01:14:22.930
that's deep shit to be a man like in your late forties looking back at your

2920
01:14:22.931 --> 01:14:23.470
life,

2921
01:14:23.470 --> 01:14:26.080
this disaster wreckage that you've put forth,

2922
01:14:26.130 --> 01:14:29.350
the millions you've blown now he has like a retail job.

2923
01:14:29.770 --> 01:14:31.360
His parents fucking abandoned them.

2924
01:14:31.620 --> 01:14:32.950
I mean you look at that and you go,

2925
01:14:32.951 --> 01:14:33.461
Whoa,

2926
01:14:33.461 --> 01:14:34.000
this is,

2927
01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:35.530
this is wild shit man.

2928
01:14:36.300 --> 01:14:40.240
It's guy is still struggling from the way he was developed from the,

2929
01:14:40.241 --> 01:14:43.420
the tools that were instilled in him at a childhood.

2930
01:14:43.421 --> 01:14:43.840
And then,

2931
01:14:43.840 --> 01:14:44.111
you know,

2932
01:14:44.111 --> 01:14:48.790
in adolescence and having that safety net just provided him with a way to stay

2933
01:14:48.791 --> 01:14:49.624
in bed,

2934
01:14:49.750 --> 01:14:50.890
kept him week,

2935
01:14:51.040 --> 01:14:53.410
never developed character now or the,

2936
01:14:53.411 --> 01:14:53.680
uh,

2937
01:14:53.680 --> 01:14:54.580
have an opportunity.

2938
01:14:54.610 --> 01:14:55.930
Every time things go wrong,

2939
01:14:56.080 --> 01:14:57.850
every time things feel terrible,

2940
01:14:57.970 --> 01:15:01.480
you have an opportunity to learn from whatever makes you feel terrible and never

2941
01:15:01.481 --> 01:15:02.620
allow it to happen again.

2942
01:15:02.680 --> 01:15:03.520
Exactly.

2943
01:15:03.610 --> 01:15:04.300
Yeah.

2944
01:15:04.300 --> 01:15:04.751
Thank you.

2945
01:15:04.751 --> 01:15:05.710
That's forward.

2946
01:15:05.920 --> 01:15:06.400
Don't,

2947
01:15:06.400 --> 01:15:07.780
don't do it again.

2948
01:15:08.080 --> 01:15:08.470
Yeah.

2949
01:15:08.470 --> 01:15:08.861
<v 1>You know,</v>

2950
01:15:08.861 --> 01:15:10.870
learn from your mistakes.

2951
01:15:10.930 --> 01:15:11.763
We all make them.

2952
01:15:12.350 --> 01:15:13.730
<v 2>That's where meditation comes in.</v>

2953
01:15:14.180 --> 01:15:17.390
Recognizing that and solidifying it in your head and the,

2954
01:15:17.391 --> 01:15:18.980
I believe meditation in the tank,

2955
01:15:18.981 --> 01:15:21.290
which is a more magnified form of meditation.

2956
01:15:21.291 --> 01:15:24.050
I think it's more intense and I think that you can,

2957
01:15:24.051 --> 01:15:28.010
you could really get something out of that if with those sort of ideas in your

2958
01:15:28.011 --> 01:15:29.570
mind about constant,

2959
01:15:29.571 --> 01:15:31.220
consistent improvement and that's the only,

2960
01:15:31.280 --> 01:15:35.000
the only thing that you'll allow from yourself is to maintain a certain standard

2961
01:15:35.001 --> 01:15:37.580
then consistently trying to improve and do that.

2962
01:15:37.700 --> 01:15:38.331
Do that and you'll be,

2963
01:15:38.331 --> 01:15:39.290
you'll be a happier person.

2964
01:15:39.440 --> 01:15:42.980
<v 1>That's an amazing concept there to become a part of,</v>

2965
01:15:43.370 --> 01:15:47.570
to where you're involved in the Osha instruction of your own character.

2966
01:15:47.690 --> 01:15:48.170
Yes.

2967
01:15:48.170 --> 01:15:52.490
It's through your own efforts and your own evaluation and then two to make the

2968
01:15:52.491 --> 01:15:56.840
right steps and make the right decisions that to become even stronger as you go.

2969
01:15:56.960 --> 01:15:57.231
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

2970
01:15:57.231 --> 01:15:58.310
Engineering your life.

2971
01:15:58.430 --> 01:15:59.263
It can be done.

2972
01:15:59.420 --> 01:15:59.631
You know,

2973
01:15:59.631 --> 01:16:00.081
it's not,

2974
01:16:00.081 --> 01:16:01.160
it's not impossible.

2975
01:16:01.190 --> 01:16:01.491
You can,

2976
01:16:01.491 --> 01:16:01.630
I mean,

2977
01:16:01.630 --> 01:16:02.750
you can do it to a certain extent,

2978
01:16:02.870 --> 01:16:03.501
certain extent.

2979
01:16:03.501 --> 01:16:04.334
You can do it.

2980
01:16:05.660 --> 01:16:07.280
The world could be a better place crash,

2981
01:16:07.430 --> 01:16:07.920
right.

2982
01:16:07.920 --> 01:16:10.110
<v 1>It's becoming a better place to becoming a better place.</v>

2983
01:16:10.140 --> 01:16:15.030
Everybody's part there is to do is to hopefully make it a little bit better.

2984
01:16:15.060 --> 01:16:15.570
You know,

2985
01:16:15.570 --> 01:16:16.830
if we could all get on that,

2986
01:16:16.831 --> 01:16:18.090
just threw that together,

2987
01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:20.310
try to make things a little bit better,

2988
01:16:20.311 --> 01:16:21.330
just a little bit better.

2989
01:16:21.570 --> 01:16:22.291
It would really,

2990
01:16:22.291 --> 01:16:22.950
uh,

2991
01:16:22.950 --> 01:16:23.230
have,

2992
01:16:23.230 --> 01:16:23.730
uh,

2993
01:16:23.730 --> 01:16:24.990
a monstrous of fat.

2994
01:16:25.120 --> 01:16:25.780
<v 2>I agree.</v>

2995
01:16:25.780 --> 01:16:26.261
And uh,

2996
01:16:26.261 --> 01:16:27.160
I want to thank you.

2997
01:16:27.161 --> 01:16:29.080
I want to thank you for coming on the podcast and,

2998
01:16:29.081 --> 01:16:29.380
uh,

2999
01:16:29.380 --> 01:16:32.200
talking about this stuff and I really want to thank you for being this guy who

3000
01:16:32.201 --> 01:16:33.790
was out there innovating in this,

3001
01:16:33.820 --> 01:16:34.091
you know,

3002
01:16:34.091 --> 01:16:36.760
almost forgotten business because for me,

3003
01:16:37.120 --> 01:16:38.650
knowing you has been very important.

3004
01:16:38.710 --> 01:16:39.700
It's helped me a lot.

3005
01:16:39.701 --> 01:16:42.370
And knowing your tanks and being aware of that,

3006
01:16:42.430 --> 01:16:42.731
you know,

3007
01:16:42.731 --> 01:16:45.040
there's a guy out there that's pushing it so far,

3008
01:16:45.050 --> 01:16:46.750
it's created this incredible portal.

3009
01:16:46.751 --> 01:16:47.000
I,

3010
01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:47.833
I think of it,

3011
01:16:48.040 --> 01:16:48.311
I mean,

3012
01:16:48.311 --> 01:16:49.111
I know what it is,

3013
01:16:49.111 --> 01:16:52.570
is it's a tank filled with water and I know there's a heater attached and I know

3014
01:16:52.571 --> 01:16:53.450
there's filters now,

3015
01:16:53.800 --> 01:16:55.180
but for me it's a portal.

3016
01:16:55.420 --> 01:16:57.760
I get in that fucking thing and I transform,

3017
01:16:57.850 --> 01:16:59.290
I travel,

3018
01:16:59.320 --> 01:17:00.430
I go to places.

3019
01:17:00.490 --> 01:17:00.880
Yeah,

3020
01:17:00.880 --> 01:17:01.171
it does.

3021
01:17:01.171 --> 01:17:01.280
It,

3022
01:17:01.280 --> 01:17:02.290
it's a mental vehicle.

3023
01:17:02.320 --> 01:17:03.190
Takes you somewhere.

3024
01:17:03.250 --> 01:17:03.551
Yeah,

3025
01:17:03.551 --> 01:17:04.001
it does.

3026
01:17:04.001 --> 01:17:07.390
It opens up passages in your mind to take you to some pretty extraordinary

3027
01:17:07.391 --> 01:17:08.224
places.

3028
01:17:08.230 --> 01:17:09.620
So thank you my brother.

3029
01:17:09.680 --> 01:17:10.070
Thank

3030
01:17:10.070 --> 01:17:11.030
<v 1>you Joe.</v>

3031
01:17:11.031 --> 01:17:11.864
You've,

3032
01:17:12.160 --> 01:17:12.530
you know,

3033
01:17:12.530 --> 01:17:16.010
been a monumental in my life and a,

3034
01:17:16.011 --> 01:17:18.260
I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart.

3035
01:17:18.450 --> 01:17:18.691
<v 2>Well,</v>

3036
01:17:18.691 --> 01:17:19.381
we found each other,

3037
01:17:19.381 --> 01:17:19.670
man.

3038
01:17:19.670 --> 01:17:20.160
That's,

3039
01:17:20.160 --> 01:17:21.330
that's how that's supposed to work,

3040
01:17:21.360 --> 01:17:22.110
you know,

3041
01:17:22.110 --> 01:17:22.411
you know,

3042
01:17:22.411 --> 01:17:22.691
we,

3043
01:17:22.691 --> 01:17:25.320
we both let people understand,

3044
01:17:25.340 --> 01:17:25.530
uh,

3045
01:17:25.530 --> 01:17:25.790
what the,

3046
01:17:25.790 --> 01:17:29.910
the benefits of these things are and we both benefit from them as well and are

3047
01:17:29.911 --> 01:17:31.420
generous with those ideas,

3048
01:17:32.070 --> 01:17:33.720
spread those ideas to other people.

3049
01:17:33.750 --> 01:17:34.411
Just to let him know,

3050
01:17:34.411 --> 01:17:34.651
man,

3051
01:17:34.651 --> 01:17:35.820
I'm not making this up.

3052
01:17:36.090 --> 01:17:36.511
You can,

3053
01:17:36.511 --> 01:17:37.920
you can really get better.

3054
01:17:38.290 --> 01:17:39.240
Your life can fuck it.

3055
01:17:39.390 --> 01:17:40.260
And the people who,

3056
01:17:40.320 --> 01:17:41.790
if you're perfect right now,

3057
01:17:42.720 --> 01:17:43.553
who are you?

3058
01:17:43.800 --> 01:17:44.201
Who are you?

3059
01:17:44.201 --> 01:17:44.671
You strange.

3060
01:17:44.671 --> 01:17:45.270
Fuck.

3061
01:17:45.270 --> 01:17:47.480
But I really believe everyone way,

3062
01:17:47.510 --> 01:17:48.343
not everyone.

3063
01:17:48.480 --> 01:17:50.070
Everyone can benefit from that.

3064
01:17:50.110 --> 01:17:50.943
Everyone.

3065
01:17:51.090 --> 01:17:51.511
So,

3066
01:17:51.511 --> 01:17:51.780
uh,

3067
01:17:51.780 --> 01:17:52.800
if you guys want to go,

3068
01:17:52.801 --> 01:17:53.850
the float lab is a,

3069
01:17:53.851 --> 01:17:56.580
is booked up rock solid deep into August.

3070
01:17:56.581 --> 01:17:57.414
But um,

3071
01:17:57.510 --> 01:17:57.930
the,

3072
01:17:57.930 --> 01:17:58.860
the Brentwood one,

3073
01:17:58.861 --> 01:17:59.351
who knows what,

3074
01:17:59.351 --> 01:17:59.791
we'll be open.

3075
01:17:59.791 --> 01:18:00.870
Hopefully Westwood.

3076
01:18:00.871 --> 01:18:01.231
Excuse me.

3077
01:18:01.231 --> 01:18:02.490
You got to print one Westwood.

3078
01:18:02.520 --> 01:18:03.240
What's the difference?

3079
01:18:03.240 --> 01:18:03.481
Where's,

3080
01:18:03.481 --> 01:18:04.320
where's Westwood?

3081
01:18:04.740 --> 01:18:05.573
Ucla.

3082
01:18:05.670 --> 01:18:06.503
Okay.

3083
01:18:06.630 --> 01:18:07.410
Where's Brentwood?

3084
01:18:07.410 --> 01:18:08.011
Brentwood is,

3085
01:18:08.011 --> 01:18:08.890
I always confuse those tests.

3086
01:18:09.010 --> 01:18:09.820
I just realized,

3087
01:18:09.820 --> 01:18:10.653
right,

3088
01:18:11.040 --> 01:18:12.030
which one's more posh?

3089
01:18:12.150 --> 01:18:12.940
Which one is where?

3090
01:18:12.940 --> 01:18:13.350
Um,

3091
01:18:13.350 --> 01:18:14.183
Brentwood.

3092
01:18:14.310 --> 01:18:15.840
Brentwood is where Oj killed the,

3093
01:18:16.170 --> 01:18:16.651
allegedly.

3094
01:18:16.651 --> 01:18:17.510
That's real posh.

3095
01:18:17.550 --> 01:18:18.383
It's very posh.

3096
01:18:18.450 --> 01:18:18.961
Very cost.

3097
01:18:18.961 --> 01:18:20.160
That's why I was quite shocking.

3098
01:18:20.570 --> 01:18:22.170
I'm not allowed in that neck of the woods.

3099
01:18:22.171 --> 01:18:23.004
They don't let you in.

3100
01:18:23.970 --> 01:18:24.803
I'll talk to somebody.

3101
01:18:25.090 --> 01:18:25.560
Uh,

3102
01:18:25.560 --> 01:18:26.160
anyway.

3103
01:18:26.160 --> 01:18:26.521
Um,

3104
01:18:26.521 --> 01:18:27.121
so we'll,

3105
01:18:27.121 --> 01:18:29.730
we'll let you know when a Westwood opens up.

3106
01:18:29.731 --> 01:18:32.670
We'll let you know on the podcast and meanwhile you can fall crash,

3107
01:18:32.950 --> 01:18:33.420
