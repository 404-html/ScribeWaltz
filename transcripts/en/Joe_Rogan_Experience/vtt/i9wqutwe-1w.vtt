WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.220
<v Speaker 1>Keep joints in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not quite big enough.</v>

2
00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:03.323
<v Speaker 1>The holes.</v>

3
00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:06.550
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause they come out like all bent and</v>

4
00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:07.180
<v Speaker 2>sad.</v>

5
00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:08.080
<v Speaker 1>We're live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6
00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:11.570
<v Speaker 1>I tried to keep joints in there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it didn't just stay put in there.</v>

7
00:00:11.571 --> 00:00:14.590
<v Speaker 1>It all kind of were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like half on half smushed.</v>

8
00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:16.930
<v Speaker 2>We need like one of those bubblegum</v>
<v Speaker 2>brains.</v>

9
00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:19.440
<v Speaker 1>You can just sticking it in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

10
00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:21.840
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want a fanboy out when I met</v>

11
00:00:21.841 --> 00:00:22.680
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm a huge fan.</v>

12
00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.690
<v Speaker 1>I really love your music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think Dave Cross,</v>

13
00:00:26.691 --> 00:00:27.910
<v Speaker 1>it was the first guy who turned me onto</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

14
00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:29.130
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

15
00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.220
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember how I met.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just remember him telling me about exile</v>

16
00:00:32.221 --> 00:00:34.560
<v Speaker 1>in Guyville.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you mean Mr showed?</v>

17
00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:35.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

18
00:00:35.611 --> 00:00:36.270
<v Speaker 1>he's the one.</v>

19
00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.770
<v Speaker 2>He was a big Mr Show was in my happiest</v>
<v Speaker 2>touring iteration.</v>

20
00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.640
<v Speaker 2>Like that was what we watched every</v>
<v Speaker 2>night after the show we'd hit the bus</v>

21
00:00:44.641 --> 00:00:47.020
<v Speaker 2>and everyone would watch mister show</v>
<v Speaker 2>tilly passed out.</v>

22
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.920
<v Speaker 1>That's a genius show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's like for Bob and Bob</v>

23
00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:55.470
<v Speaker 1>Degrade on better call Saul and breaking</v>
<v Speaker 1>bad and has done a lot of other stuff.</v>

24
00:00:55.471 --> 00:00:57.960
<v Speaker 1>That's awesome too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's something about the two of</v>

25
00:00:57.961 --> 00:00:59.210
<v Speaker 1>those guys together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

26
00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.470
<v Speaker 1>very unusual combination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're writing,</v>

27
00:01:01.471 --> 00:01:05.720
<v Speaker 1>it's just so bizarre and weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they did a netflix thing for awhile.</v>

28
00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.140
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if there are they still</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing that,</v>

29
00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.480
<v Speaker 1>do you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he's doing those other shows</v>

30
00:01:09.481 --> 00:01:10.380
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>

31
00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.480
<v Speaker 1>Too Bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

32
00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.510
<v Speaker 1>Dave Cross introduce me to Liz phair.</v>

33
00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:17.670
<v Speaker 2>Well I am,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a nice,</v>

34
00:01:17.671 --> 00:01:20.080
<v Speaker 2>that's a nice touchstone since it was</v>
<v Speaker 2>part of my touring.</v>

35
00:01:20.081 --> 00:01:20.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

36
00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.960
<v Speaker 1>there you go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel very good about that.</v>

37
00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:23.820
<v Speaker 1>So you got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you have now?</v>

38
00:01:23.821 --> 00:01:25.850

<v Speaker 1>compilation.</v>

39
00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:26.783
<v Speaker 1>Is that what it means?</v>

40
00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:31.790
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a reissue of my first record exile</v>

41
00:01:31.791 --> 00:01:33.020
<v Speaker 2>in Guyville.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

42
00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:38.050
<v Speaker 2>with the original girlies sound tapes</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I made on a four track in Ga late</v>

43
00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:42.493
<v Speaker 2>eighties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>early nineties.</v>

44
00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.600
<v Speaker 2>Is that when you were living at home?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

45
00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.740
<v Speaker 2>that was when I was recalled back from</v>
<v Speaker 2>San Francisco having not gotten a job</v>

46
00:01:48.741 --> 00:01:52.490
<v Speaker 2>and run out of money and grifting my way</v>
<v Speaker 2>across like the bay area.</v>

47
00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.350
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I had a place,</v>

48
00:01:54.351 --> 00:01:55.100
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

49
00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.270
<v Speaker 2>I was rooming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone from my college class moved out</v>

50
00:01:59.271 --> 00:02:02.600
<v Speaker 2>to San Francisco basically from Oberlin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went to,</v>

51
00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:08.500
<v Speaker 2>and I made these little cassettes that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>forwarded to two friends and one of them</v>

52
00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:14.990
<v Speaker 2>got super busy making copies of these</v>
<v Speaker 2>cassettes and sent them to every fanzine</v>

53
00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.320
<v Speaker 2>in America with this like glowing</v>
<v Speaker 2>recommendation.</v>

54
00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.210
<v Speaker 2>And all of a sudden I was getting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was living at home,</v>

55
00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:27.080
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>still didn't have a job and I would get</v>

56
00:02:27.081 --> 00:02:29.510
<v Speaker 2>these envelopes coming to me saying</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

57
00:02:29.511 --> 00:02:32.750
<v Speaker 2>please make me a cassette copy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's $10.</v>

58
00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.240
<v Speaker 2>Can you imagine what happened to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>$10?</v>

59
00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.650
<v Speaker 2>How awful is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I truly just like,</v>

60
00:02:40.651 --> 00:02:41.730
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>great,</v>

61
00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.290
<v Speaker 2>thanks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't making it.</v>

62
00:02:43.291 --> 00:02:44.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

63
00:02:44.491 --> 00:02:47.610
<v Speaker 2>Like there's about a hundred people that</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't get their cassette,</v>

64
00:02:47.611 --> 00:02:49.640
<v Speaker 2>but I wasn't making in the cassette.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But anyway,</v>

65
00:02:49.641 --> 00:02:54.641
<v Speaker 2>that's sort of Taijuan you is actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>the person who made lots of cassettes</v>

66
00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:57.620
<v Speaker 2>and sent them around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I have him to thank,</v>

67
00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.490
<v Speaker 1>did you have a thought</v>

68
00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:05.190
<v Speaker 3>that you were going to eventually make</v>
<v Speaker 3>it or be a big singer or the g?</v>

69
00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.090
<v Speaker 3>Was that even an idea?</v>

70
00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:09.100
<v Speaker 2>Not a clue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I cleaned it.</v>

71
00:03:09.101 --> 00:03:11.620
<v Speaker 2>Being in front of people like I would</v>
<v Speaker 2>not want to.</v>

72
00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.460
<v Speaker 2>I loved being in the studio.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I loved recording but I didn't,</v>

73
00:03:15.461 --> 00:03:20.461
<v Speaker 2>I was super stage frightened and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>couldn't think of anything.</v>

74
00:03:21.221 --> 00:03:25.570
<v Speaker 2>I'd rather do less and get up in front</v>
<v Speaker 2>of you or play music or do anything</v>

75
00:03:25.571 --> 00:03:26.351
<v Speaker 2>really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

76
00:03:26.351 --> 00:03:27.970
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

77
00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:31.210
<v Speaker 2>But it is hard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you obviously have a love of music.</v>

78
00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:33.190
<v Speaker 2>I love playing music.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

79
00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.500
<v Speaker 2>I get very self conscious with a group</v>
<v Speaker 2>called this sucker up to you.</v>

80
00:03:36.501 --> 00:03:39.900
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise we're not going to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get very self conscious in front of</v>

81
00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.670
<v Speaker 2>crowds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Still not so much anymore.</v>

82
00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:45.670
<v Speaker 2>I do about two weeks before I hit the</v>
<v Speaker 2>stage,</v>

83
00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:50.700
<v Speaker 2>I will stop sleeping and then really to</v>
<v Speaker 2>work myself into this kind of cold</v>

84
00:03:52.121 --> 00:03:53.590
<v Speaker 2>sweat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I think about it,</v>

85
00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:57.970
<v Speaker 2>I'll be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can I leave the country?</v>

86
00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:02.140
<v Speaker 2>And then like I get on the stage and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>all comes back to me and I'm like,</v>

87
00:04:02.141 --> 00:04:04.630
<v Speaker 2>I've done this a million times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the best job in the world.</v>

88
00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:06.090
<v Speaker 2>And it just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

89
00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:10.570
<v Speaker 2>I can't psych myself into that feeling</v>
<v Speaker 2>until I'm actually on stage.</v>

90
00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:12.940
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that's just cause you care about</v>
<v Speaker 2>it so much.</v>

91
00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:16.690
<v Speaker 2>Probably I'm too alert.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We should be smoking those joints that</v>

92
00:04:16.691 --> 00:04:18.670
<v Speaker 2>are not in own head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have some over here.</v>

93
00:04:18.671 --> 00:04:20.710
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can't even imagine where we'd go with</v>

94
00:04:20.711 --> 00:04:22.480
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We do it all the time.</v>

95
00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:24.430
<v Speaker 2>She want to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me know.</v>

96
00:04:24.431 --> 00:04:26.110
<v Speaker 2>We're about 10 minutes and he changed</v>
<v Speaker 2>your mind.</v>

97
00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:28.540
<v Speaker 2>I can time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It gets really rough,</v>

98
00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.020
<v Speaker 2>but it gets really personal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe sometimes you have to and I'm</v>

99
00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.850
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a very awake person.</v>

100
00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:34.773
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>

101
00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:36.610
<v Speaker 3>Well that's a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

102
00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:39.510
<v Speaker 3>that's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the more sensitive you are though,</v>

103
00:04:39.511 --> 00:04:42.760
<v Speaker 3>the more you have to consider all the</v>
<v Speaker 3>possibilities and that that's what could</v>

104
00:04:42.761 --> 00:04:43.594
<v Speaker 3>keep you up.</v>

105
00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:46.240
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To send you down the UFO wormhole.</v>

106
00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:47.560
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We talked about that</v>

107
00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.891
<v Speaker 3>cast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

108
00:04:48.891 --> 00:04:51.370
<v Speaker 3>There's this guy that's coming on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His name is doctor Robert Schoch can</v>

109
00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:55.310
<v Speaker 3>easy geologists from Boston University</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he's worked on,</v>

110
00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:56.410
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

111
00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:01.630
<v Speaker 3>some real scientists that believe it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>entirely possible that the sphinx and a</v>

112
00:05:02.181 --> 00:05:04.670
<v Speaker 3>lot of the construction in Egypt is far</v>
<v Speaker 3>older than they think</v>

113
00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:08.440
<v Speaker 2>I know all about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all about know about Robert Shaw runoff</v>

114
00:05:08.441 --> 00:05:13.150
<v Speaker 2>and erosion has occurred around the base</v>
<v Speaker 2>or around the pit that the,</v>

115
00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:17.260
<v Speaker 2>and it absolutely couldn't have been</v>
<v Speaker 2>done depending on like the way the</v>

116
00:05:17.261 --> 00:05:20.110
<v Speaker 2>Sphinx is built where it's located.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This sighting.</v>

117
00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:22.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where it's level is,</v>

118
00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:24.740
<v Speaker 2>is far older.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

119

120
00:05:28.131 --> 00:05:31.130
<v Speaker 3>neighborhood of 9,000 plus bc because</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the law.</v>

121
00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:35.800
<v Speaker 3>When back then the Nile Valley was a</v>
<v Speaker 3>rain forest and somehow or another it</v>

122
00:05:35.801 --> 00:05:37.720
<v Speaker 3>became a desert.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

<v Speaker 3>but he's here for some Ufo conference</v>

126
00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:50.990
<v Speaker 3>and the Ufo people wanted to him to</v>
<v Speaker 3>mention the UFO conference.</v>

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:56.600
<v Speaker 3>you guys don't have anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you had something that would be,</v>

129
00:05:56.601 --> 00:06:00.020
<v Speaker 3>what are you gonna get in a fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>merriot somewhere and show,</v>

<v Speaker 3>air.</v>

132
00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:06.830
<v Speaker 3>Like there's nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything that,</v>

133
00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:09.710
<v Speaker 3>everything that they look at falls apart</v>
<v Speaker 3>under scrutiny.</v>

134
00:06:09.711 --> 00:06:10.640
<v Speaker 3>This is oak.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A few videos.</v>

135
00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.030
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to push back on.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Please do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Please do.</v>

137
00:06:12.841 --> 00:06:14.100
<v Speaker 2>Let's just say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what about,</v>

138
00:06:14.101 --> 00:06:16.890
<v Speaker 2>do you know the discovery disclosure?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

139
00:06:16.891 --> 00:06:18.270
<v Speaker 2>Disclosure project.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

140
00:06:18.271 --> 00:06:21.270
<v Speaker 2>There was their first press conference</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they got all the,</v>

141
00:06:21.271 --> 00:06:22.050
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

142
00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:25.290
<v Speaker 2>I tend to be impressed by the military,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

143
00:06:25.291 --> 00:06:26.760
<v Speaker 2>ranking members.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sort of like,</v>

144
00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:29.490
<v Speaker 2>if you were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you were guarding missile silos and</v>

145
00:06:29.491 --> 00:06:32.910
<v Speaker 2>you say you saw something hover above it</v>
<v Speaker 2>and deactivate,</v>

146
00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:36.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm probably going to check that out a</v>

147
00:06:36.361 --> 00:06:39.270
<v Speaker 2>little harder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there were just so many people that</v>

148
00:06:39.271 --> 00:06:41.220
<v Speaker 2>stood up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

149
00:06:41.221 --> 00:06:44.880
<v Speaker 2>in that press conference and said that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they absolutely had seen evidence,</v>

150
00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:48.510
<v Speaker 2>met extra terrestrials seeing the</v>
<v Speaker 2>crafts,</v>

151
00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:51.530
<v Speaker 2>like in hangars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>et cetera.</v>

152
00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:53.310
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And to me,</v>

153
00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:56.400
<v Speaker 2>like I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they didn't look like they had that much</v>

154
00:06:56.401 --> 00:06:58.560
<v Speaker 2>imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're the kind of people that I didn't</v>

155
00:06:58.561 --> 00:07:00.450
<v Speaker 2>think could really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

156
00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:02.760
<v Speaker 2>did you find that convincing at all?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

157
00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:03.743
<v Speaker 2>Here's why.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

158
00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:05.670
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just like a whole bunch of liars,</v>

159
00:07:05.671 --> 00:07:07.290
<v Speaker 2>a whole line of live greer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

160
00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:10.080
<v Speaker 2>The disclosure project so much about</v>
<v Speaker 2>him,</v>

161
00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:13.170
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't appeal to me as much as the</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that he brought on who were</v>

162
00:07:13.171 --> 00:07:14.790
<v Speaker 2>mostly military.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

163
00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:19.550
<v Speaker 3>Here's the thing about military.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anybody who's in the military is a</v>

164
00:07:19.551 --> 00:07:21.890
<v Speaker 3>person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you get a hundred people together,</v>

165
00:07:21.891 --> 00:07:23.270
<v Speaker 3>one of them is out of their fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>mind.</v>

166
00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:27.620
<v Speaker 3>If you get a million people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got a shit ton of people that are</v>

167
00:07:27.621 --> 00:07:31.550
<v Speaker 3>out of their fucking mind that are</v>
<v Speaker 3>running around that one extra attention.</v>

168
00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:35.060
<v Speaker 3>One of the best ways to say you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you are one of the best ways to get</v>

169
00:07:35.061 --> 00:07:38.720
<v Speaker 3>extra tension is to say you've had some</v>
<v Speaker 3>extraordinary experience that separates</v>

170
00:07:38.721 --> 00:07:42.260
<v Speaker 3>you from the pack.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the main points of delusion</v>

171
00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:44.660
<v Speaker 3>that people that are really out of their</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking mind,</v>

172
00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:45.890
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it won't want to point to.</v>

173
00:07:45.891 --> 00:07:49.310
<v Speaker 3>I see things in people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can read Auras.</v>

174
00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:53.660
<v Speaker 3>I can tell I'm a psychic healer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm an intuitive person.</v>

175
00:07:53.661 --> 00:07:57.110
<v Speaker 3>They all have this thing that separates</v>
<v Speaker 3>them from the herd without any work</v>

176
00:07:57.111 --> 00:08:00.320
<v Speaker 3>whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like a lot of these people are</v>

177
00:08:00.321 --> 00:08:04.250
<v Speaker 3>that they want attention and so they</v>
<v Speaker 3>tell these extraordinary stories.</v>

178
00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:07.680
<v Speaker 3>Now when you said they're not creative,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a very astute point cause they</v>

179
00:08:07.681 --> 00:08:10.640
<v Speaker 3>all the same fucking story cause it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>the same story that's been going on</v>

180
00:08:10.641 --> 00:08:12.620
<v Speaker 3>forever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just repeat shit they've already</v>

181
00:08:12.621 --> 00:08:15.110
<v Speaker 3>heard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most of these people I think are full of</v>

182
00:08:15.111 --> 00:08:18.980
<v Speaker 3>Shit I think is entirely possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That UFO is a been here entirely</v>

183
00:08:18.981 --> 00:08:23.090
<v Speaker 3>possible that see people have seen you</v>
<v Speaker 3>at foes entirely possible but a lot of</v>

184
00:08:23.091 --> 00:08:25.850
<v Speaker 3>those people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my fucking bullshit radar just goes off.</v>

185
00:08:25.851 --> 00:08:28.850
<v Speaker 3>I paint May,</v>
<v Speaker 3>may main yeah I I've talked to too many</v>

186
00:08:28.851 --> 00:08:32.210
<v Speaker 3>of them and when I did that television</v>
<v Speaker 3>show Joe Rogan questions everything and</v>

187
00:08:32.211 --> 00:08:35.440
<v Speaker 3>I met with Ufo people in bigfoot people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was telling you before the podcast,</v>

188
00:08:35.441 --> 00:08:39.440
<v Speaker 3>it cured me cause I got to be around</v>
<v Speaker 3>those people for hours and just talk to</v>

<v Speaker 3>No cameras on them like,</v>

190
00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:42.200
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're fucking crazy,</v>

191
00:08:42.201 --> 00:08:45.680
<v Speaker 3>or you're delusional,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or your way of looking at things is not</v>

192
00:08:45.681 --> 00:08:48.350
<v Speaker 3>objective or you're talking to me</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you want to convince me of</v>

193
00:08:48.351 --> 00:08:49.970
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not just communicating the ideas</v>

194
00:08:49.971 --> 00:08:53.000
<v Speaker 3>that are actually in your head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're pitching me some sort of a</v>

195
00:08:53.001 --> 00:08:54.020
<v Speaker 3>speech.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>

196
00:08:54.021 --> 00:08:56.090
<v Speaker 3>you've got some sort of a you're doing</v>
<v Speaker 3>for me.</v>

197
00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:58.980
<v Speaker 3>I smell it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and as a performer I smell it.</v>

198
00:08:59.010 --> 00:09:00.150
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is nonsense.</v>

199
00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:02.010
<v Speaker 3>You telling me nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

200
00:09:02.011 --> 00:09:02.844
<v Speaker 3>they would tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

201
00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:04.890
<v Speaker 3>you want evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll back a truck up and show you the</v>

202
00:09:04.891 --> 00:09:05.371
<v Speaker 3>evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

203
00:09:05.371 --> 00:09:06.270
<v Speaker 3>where's your fucking evidence?</v>

204
00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:08.820
<v Speaker 2>You don't have any other audit today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean like,</v>

205
00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:09.990
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's the thing.</v>

206
00:09:09.991 --> 00:09:14.830
<v Speaker 2>Did they seem as off kilter in</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything else they talked about that</v>

207
00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:15.863
<v Speaker 2>relationship,</v>

208
00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:17.840
<v Speaker 3>relationships,</v>
<v Speaker 3>jobs,</v>

209
00:09:17.841 --> 00:09:20.390
<v Speaker 3>they're all screwballs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're almost all screw balls.</v>

210
00:09:20.450 --> 00:09:24.740
<v Speaker 3>The people that are most convincing are</v>
<v Speaker 3>the people that see these orbs flying</v>

211
00:09:24.741 --> 00:09:26.360
<v Speaker 3>around the pilots.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

212
00:09:26.361 --> 00:09:28.370
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the reason why they see these things is</v>

213
00:09:28.371 --> 00:09:30.830
<v Speaker 3>there's a real phenomenon called ball</v>
<v Speaker 3>lightning.</v>

214
00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:35.860
<v Speaker 3>It's absolutely real and it's caused by</v>
<v Speaker 3>various weather conditions and they</v>

215
00:09:36.681 --> 00:09:40.970
<v Speaker 3>think that even be caused sometimes by</v>
<v Speaker 3>the right weather conditions and the</v>

216
00:09:40.971 --> 00:09:44.120
<v Speaker 3>shifting of tectonic plates that somehow</v>
<v Speaker 3>or another the friction.</v>

217
00:09:44.290 --> 00:09:46.640
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that these Bob Ball lightning,</v>

218
00:09:46.641 --> 00:09:48.710
<v Speaker 3>if you've ever seen videos of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's phenomenal.</v>

219
00:09:48.711 --> 00:09:52.070
<v Speaker 3>It just flies around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've even had an inside airplanes</v>

220
00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:55.880
<v Speaker 3>somehow or another ball.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lightning has shot down the aisle of an</v>

221
00:09:55.881 --> 00:09:57.540
<v Speaker 3>airplane while I was in Florida.</v>

222
00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:02.380
<v Speaker 2>Have you really enlightening on a flight</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was struck by lightning?</v>

223
00:10:02.710 --> 00:10:07.600
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was pink and it sounded like a giant</v>

224
00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:09.910
<v Speaker 2>bb gun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hid a tin can.</v>

225
00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:12.243
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

226
00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:14.560
<v Speaker 3>You were in a plane that was hit by</v>
<v Speaker 3>lightning.</v>

227
00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:17.490
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>

228
00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:19.860
<v Speaker 2>That's intense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was very intense.</v>

229
00:10:19.861 --> 00:10:23.640
<v Speaker 2>I was coming off of tour and I wanted to</v>
<v Speaker 2>get back to my very young son.</v>

230
00:10:23.641 --> 00:10:25.740
<v Speaker 2>I told him I'd be there in the morning</v>
<v Speaker 2>when he woke up,</v>

231
00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:29.100
<v Speaker 2>so I ended up going on this odyssey like</v>
<v Speaker 2>planes,</v>

232
00:10:29.101 --> 00:10:30.480
<v Speaker 2>trains and automobiles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

233
00:10:30.481 --> 00:10:31.550
<v Speaker 2>trying to get to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

234
00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:35.370
<v Speaker 2>Like I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will be there in the morning and it</v>

235
00:10:35.371 --> 00:10:37.950
<v Speaker 2>was terrible weather.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just like the worst on the east</v>

236
00:10:37.951 --> 00:10:39.300
<v Speaker 2>coast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we kept taking,</v>

237
00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:42.930
<v Speaker 2>I think twice we took off and had to</v>
<v Speaker 2>land before we could get to our</v>

238
00:10:42.931 --> 00:10:45.690
<v Speaker 2>destination and get in the plane and go</v>
<v Speaker 2>off again.</v>

239
00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:48.660
<v Speaker 2>And me being a crazy mom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

240
00:10:48.770 --> 00:10:50.240
<v Speaker 2>how can I get there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

241
00:10:50.250 --> 00:10:52.650
<v Speaker 2>so I get on this plane and it's very</v>
<v Speaker 2>bad.</v>

242
00:10:52.651 --> 00:10:54.270
<v Speaker 2>We're flying right through with</v>
<v Speaker 2>thunderstorm.</v>

243
00:10:54.271 --> 00:10:56.100
<v Speaker 2>But I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've flown so many times,</v>

244
00:10:56.140 --> 00:10:58.920
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my parents took me a million places.</v>

245
00:10:58.930 --> 00:11:03.710
<v Speaker 2>We traveled a lot when I was young,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I've just been flying forever and we</v>

246
00:11:03.950 --> 00:11:08.570
<v Speaker 2>were on this blame,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the lightning's going off and thunder</v>

247
00:11:08.571 --> 00:11:12.030
<v Speaker 2>and we're rattling around and it's not a</v>
<v Speaker 2>very big plane.</v>

248
00:11:12.031 --> 00:11:14.040
<v Speaker 2>And my seat mate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

249
00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:17.430
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know who he was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he seemed like a decent,</v>

250
00:11:17.431 --> 00:11:21.390
<v Speaker 2>nice young man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like the lightening just hit the</v>

251
00:11:21.391 --> 00:11:24.570
<v Speaker 2>plane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get this big Tang of the,</v>

252
00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:26.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the shock of the electricity just</v>

253
00:11:26.821 --> 00:11:28.590
<v Speaker 2>hitting it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We drop about,</v>

254
00:11:28.591 --> 00:11:30.930
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what makes a big stomach</v>

255
00:11:30.931 --> 00:11:32.240
<v Speaker 2>drop,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we drop far.</v>

256
00:11:32.241 --> 00:11:34.030
<v Speaker 2>It's like 25 feet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I Dunno.</v>

257
00:11:34.050 --> 00:11:38.400
<v Speaker 2>Just like Bam.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this pink ball of electricity just</v>

258
00:11:38.401 --> 00:11:40.970
<v Speaker 2>goes like whoosh down the aisle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

259
00:11:41.070 --> 00:11:44.860
<v Speaker 2>In the center of the aisle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He pukes I grab</v>

260
00:11:46.810 --> 00:11:51.810
<v Speaker 2>and I did not let go of this change or</v>
<v Speaker 2>just puked like until we were,</v>

261
00:11:52.021 --> 00:11:52.854
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I just,</v>

262
00:11:53.530 --> 00:11:54.700
<v Speaker 2>it took about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

263
00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:57.530
<v Speaker 2>10 minutes and then it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

264
00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:01.990
<v Speaker 2>but that was intense and I made it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was there in the morning when my son</v>

265
00:12:01.991 --> 00:12:04.360
<v Speaker 2>woke up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's awesome.</v>

266
00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:05.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it was incredible.</v>

267
00:12:05.741 --> 00:12:09.880
<v Speaker 2>The pinkness of it is still really vivid</v>
<v Speaker 2>to my mind and the ball lightning.</v>

268
00:12:09.881 --> 00:12:13.180
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a sphere that just came wishing</v>

269
00:12:13.181 --> 00:12:14.980
<v Speaker 2>down the aisle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

270
00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:19.240
<v Speaker 2>That's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lots of crazy plane.</v>

271
00:12:19.690 --> 00:12:21.950
<v Speaker 2>Almost crashed stories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What else?</v>

272
00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:25.330
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a time that the engine was on</v>

273
00:12:25.331 --> 00:12:29.850
<v Speaker 2>fire and I could see it that you could</v>
<v Speaker 2>see it on fire.</v>

274
00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:31.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

275
00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:33.400
<v Speaker 2>Where were you please don't say over the</v>
<v Speaker 2>ocean.</v>

276
00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:36.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not far.</v>

277
00:12:36.071 --> 00:12:41.071
<v Speaker 2>We were just off outside of Boston.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We took off nighttime again after a show</v>

278
00:12:41.651 --> 00:12:43.940
<v Speaker 2>trying to get home to my cat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is like this dad,</v>

279
00:12:43.941 --> 00:12:48.520
<v Speaker 2>his mom's story trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

280
00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:51.490
<v Speaker 2>and it was night and I was looking at</v>
<v Speaker 2>the lights,</v>

281
00:12:51.491 --> 00:12:53.560
<v Speaker 2>the sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forget what they call those orange</v>

282
00:12:53.561 --> 00:12:58.561
<v Speaker 2>lights and it was over the bag and see</v>
<v Speaker 2>the water and we just weren't rising</v>

283
00:12:59.140 --> 00:12:59.920
<v Speaker 2>quickly enough.</v>

284
00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:00.401
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just,</v>

285
00:13:00.401 --> 00:13:03.310
<v Speaker 2>I was like why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why aren't we gaining altitude?</v>

286
00:13:03.311 --> 00:13:05.290
<v Speaker 2>What's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just didn't seem right.</v>

287
00:13:05.890 --> 00:13:10.510
<v Speaker 2>And someone on my left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was in the last row and someone on my</v>

288
00:13:10.511 --> 00:13:13.990
<v Speaker 2>left said something like the engine's on</v>
<v Speaker 2>fire,</v>

289
00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:16.180
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right as the captain comes on and says,</v>

290
00:13:16.181 --> 00:13:18.640
<v Speaker 2>ladies and gentlemen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have a problem with one of the</v>

291
00:13:18.641 --> 00:13:20.950
<v Speaker 2>engines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are going to have to make an</v>

292
00:13:20.951 --> 00:13:23.470
<v Speaker 2>emergency landing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Please remain in your seat.</v>

293
00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:29.650
<v Speaker 2>And I look over and you can literally</v>
<v Speaker 2>see flames shooting out of the,</v>

294
00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:32.040
<v Speaker 2>like it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause the,</v>

295
00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:35.290
<v Speaker 2>the engine was about 10 rows ahead of</v>
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>

296
00:13:35.890 --> 00:13:39.400
<v Speaker 2>but the sparks were visible behind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

297
00:13:39.401 --> 00:13:41.680
<v Speaker 2>because you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you understand like the physics,</v>

298
00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.580
<v Speaker 2>so like it's a long trail is sparks</v>
<v Speaker 2>coming out of that thing.</v>

299
00:13:45.581 --> 00:13:50.581
<v Speaker 2>And so we get to the point where we're</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to make our like landing and to</v>

300
00:13:52.691 --> 00:13:57.310
<v Speaker 2>see the flight attendants scared</v>
<v Speaker 2>shitless was not a fun experience.</v>

301
00:13:57.310 --> 00:14:01.660
<v Speaker 2>I think that frightened me the most.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like seeing their faces and we had to</v>

302
00:14:01.661 --> 00:14:03.740
<v Speaker 2>get into the crouch position,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

303
00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:06.310
<v Speaker 2>that position,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the brace yourself position.</v>

304
00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:09.610
<v Speaker 2>And the captain came on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the last thing he said,</v>

305
00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:15.060
<v Speaker 2>which was not reassuring was please</v>
<v Speaker 2>brace for a very rough landing.</v>

306
00:14:15.671 --> 00:14:19.090
<v Speaker 2>And I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm thinking if you're crashing it</v>

307
00:14:19.091 --> 00:14:21.130
<v Speaker 2>doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't say anything more than that</v>

308
00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:24.490
<v Speaker 2>ladies and gentlemen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You mean like that's it.</v>

309
00:14:24.610 --> 00:14:27.970
<v Speaker 2>Please prepare for a very rough landing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what happened?</v>

310
00:14:27.971 --> 00:14:32.170
<v Speaker 2>I know I'm like monologuing but like</v>
<v Speaker 2>what happened to my body at that moment</v>

311
00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:34.780
<v Speaker 2>was I went into,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's only happened twice in my life.</v>

312
00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:38.440
<v Speaker 2>Full tremors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like full body.</v>

313
00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:40.090
<v Speaker 2>Do you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have you ever had that?</v>

314
00:14:40.091 --> 00:14:42.340
<v Speaker 2>It's different than like nervous shaking</v>
<v Speaker 2>or cold shaking.</v>

315
00:14:42.341 --> 00:14:47.341
<v Speaker 2>It's like full</v>
<v Speaker 2>and your body's just like completely</v>

316
00:14:47.351 --> 00:14:49.540
<v Speaker 2>vibrating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like at another frequency.</v>

317
00:14:49.870 --> 00:14:54.710
<v Speaker 2>And I realized for the first time in my</v>
<v Speaker 2>life that I didn't care if I was dead</v>

318
00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:56.660
<v Speaker 2>like in two seconds.</v>

319
00:14:56.660 --> 00:14:59.810
<v Speaker 2>And I felt nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It really upset me that my body,</v>

320
00:14:59.811 --> 00:15:03.230
<v Speaker 2>my soft squishy body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was going to be like pinned into</v>

321
00:15:03.231 --> 00:15:07.310
<v Speaker 2>metal bugged me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I really thought like we're never</v>

322
00:15:07.311 --> 00:15:10.040
<v Speaker 2>doing this again like this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just became very,</v>

323
00:15:10.041 --> 00:15:13.610
<v Speaker 2>very real that my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I cared about this arm and I cared</v>

324
00:15:13.611 --> 00:15:17.900
<v Speaker 2>about this lag and I didn't want like it</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be completely mangled and like stuck</v>

325
00:15:17.901 --> 00:15:20.990
<v Speaker 2>in metal and we hit the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we got the ground,</v>

326
00:15:20.991 --> 00:15:25.991
<v Speaker 2>it was a very rough landing and there</v>
<v Speaker 2>were firetrucks going like 110 miles an</v>

327
00:15:27.261 --> 00:15:32.180
<v Speaker 2>hour on either side of us spraying us</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the d accelerant or whatever that</v>

328
00:15:32.181 --> 00:15:37.040
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and suddenly like foam on the windows</v>

329
00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:40.160
<v Speaker 2>and are you ready for this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was not a fun thing,</v>

330
00:15:40.161 --> 00:15:44.450
<v Speaker 2>but we survived and no one was harmed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then we had to get back on another</v>

331
00:15:44.451 --> 00:15:46.970
<v Speaker 2>plane because I had to go home to see my</v>
<v Speaker 2>kids.</v>

332
00:15:46.970 --> 00:15:51.620
<v Speaker 2>So he literally sat there and waited and</v>
<v Speaker 2>got right back on another plane and flew</v>

333
00:15:51.621 --> 00:15:53.630
<v Speaker 2>home.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well you probably be like,</v>

334
00:15:53.631 --> 00:15:55.670
<v Speaker 2>what are the odds?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

335
00:15:55.671 --> 00:15:57.050
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to see my kid.</v>

336
00:15:57.160 --> 00:15:59.840
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like that was an intense,</v>

337
00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:03.200
<v Speaker 2>you mean that thing you don't ever get</v>
<v Speaker 2>to experience us unless you're like a</v>

338
00:16:03.201 --> 00:16:06.980
<v Speaker 2>combat person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like even if you're not conscious,</v>

339
00:16:06.981 --> 00:16:11.000
<v Speaker 2>I don't want this like all screwed up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to be like mangled.</v>

340
00:16:11.230 --> 00:16:14.450
<v Speaker 2>No one does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the reality of it was like right</v>

341
00:16:14.451 --> 00:16:17.510
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right there and I don't feel it anymore.</v>

342
00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:20.240
<v Speaker 2>I'm just a stupid and reckless as I ever</v>
<v Speaker 2>was.</v>

343
00:16:20.241 --> 00:16:22.730
<v Speaker 2>But like in that moment it was very real</v>
<v Speaker 2>to me.</v>

344
00:16:22.731 --> 00:16:23.564
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

345
00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:27.030
<v Speaker 1>Fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't had anything like that.</v>

346
00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:30.840
<v Speaker 1>That's intense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what's more intense getting</v>

347
00:16:30.841 --> 00:16:32.970
<v Speaker 1>to hit by lightening or the fire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're both pretty fun.</v>

348
00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:37.360
<v Speaker 2>The Cessna that lost power over the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bermuda Triangle,</v>

349
00:16:37.570 --> 00:16:38.403
<v Speaker 2>is that good?</v>

350
00:16:38.430 --> 00:16:41.550
<v Speaker 1>You know what that is?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They think they think it's nitrogen</v>

351
00:16:41.551 --> 00:16:45.000
<v Speaker 1>escaping from the sea floor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They think there's trap nitrogen and</v>

352
00:16:45.001 --> 00:16:46.140
<v Speaker 1>massive amounts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

353
00:16:46.141 --> 00:16:51.141
<v Speaker 1>cause there's a lot of like dead things</v>
<v Speaker 1>and decaying things like vegetation and</v>

354
00:16:52.291 --> 00:16:55.050
<v Speaker 1>things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they trap nitrogen pockets and those</v>

355
00:16:55.051 --> 00:16:57.060
<v Speaker 1>nitrogen pockets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they lift up,</v>

356
00:16:57.061 --> 00:17:00.450
<v Speaker 1>they can go through the surface of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>water and up into the air.</v>

357
00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:03.510
<v Speaker 1>And if a plane is flying into that is</v>
<v Speaker 1>methane.</v>

358
00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:05.760
<v Speaker 1>Is it methane?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I say it wrong.</v>

359
00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:08.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because nitrogen is every second year.</v>

360
00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:09.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So 84% of the air.</v>

361
00:17:09.870 --> 00:17:13.500
<v Speaker 1>But I think there's something about it</v>
<v Speaker 1>being a giant pocket that you fly</v>

362
00:17:13.501 --> 00:17:14.460
<v Speaker 1>through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might be wrong.</v>

363
00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:18.120
<v Speaker 1>You're talking about the gap in the tech</v>
<v Speaker 1>tonic.</v>

364
00:17:18.410 --> 00:17:19.310
<v Speaker 1>It's methane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

365
00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:21.310
<v Speaker 1>And it can like make a ship go down</v>
<v Speaker 1>because yeah.</v>

366
00:17:21.311 --> 00:17:24.300
<v Speaker 1>Suddenly there's no downside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no buoyancy for the ships and</v>

367
00:17:24.301 --> 00:17:25.260
<v Speaker 1>also for planes.</v>

368
00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:26.041
<v Speaker 1>It makes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could be,</v>

369
00:17:26.041 --> 00:17:26.611
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

370
00:17:26.611 --> 00:17:29.690
<v Speaker 1>This is most explosions explaining it</v>
<v Speaker 1>for me to try it.</v>

371
00:17:29.870 --> 00:17:30.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can google.</v>

372
00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:32.800
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is how we roll it.</v>

373
00:17:32.801 --> 00:17:34.950
<v Speaker 1>I'm never leaving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come state.</v>

374
00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:37.560
<v Speaker 1>You can come anytime you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is incredible.</v>

375
00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:39.330
<v Speaker 1>We can come and just talk about Ufo was</v>
<v Speaker 1>over a week.</v>

376
00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:40.680
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is incredible.</v>

377
00:17:41.010 --> 00:17:44.670
<v Speaker 1>Explosions of trapped methane gas are</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought to account for the mysterious</v>

378
00:17:44.671 --> 00:17:46.800
<v Speaker 1>critters in Siberia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including this one.</v>

379
00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:48.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they think that has to do</v>

380
00:17:48.810 --> 00:17:50.550
<v Speaker 1>something with the Bermuda Triangle as</v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

381
00:17:50.670 --> 00:17:54.510
<v Speaker 1>So when biological tissue creates</v>
<v Speaker 1>methane and,</v>

382
00:17:54.511 --> 00:17:57.240
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they have like massive amounts of</v>

383
00:17:57.241 --> 00:18:00.240
<v Speaker 1>die off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's fish or whether it's plants</v>

384
00:18:00.241 --> 00:18:02.490
<v Speaker 1>or things like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they think that some of that stuff gets</v>

385
00:18:02.491 --> 00:18:07.491
<v Speaker 1>trapped in the bottom of the sea floor</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then escapes goes up to the surface,</v>

386
00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:10.680
<v Speaker 1>makes boats sink and even can bring down</v>
<v Speaker 1>planes.</v>

387
00:18:10.710 --> 00:18:14.290
<v Speaker 1>How did it make a plain because plain</v>
<v Speaker 1>flat,</v>

388
00:18:14.490 --> 00:18:15.460
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I dunno.</v>

389
00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:18.900
<v Speaker 1>Really lost electricity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What'd you hear that hear a plane lost</v>

390
00:18:18.901 --> 00:18:20.000
<v Speaker 1>electricity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what I thought.</v>

391
00:18:20.350 --> 00:18:21.720
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were in it started again.</v>

392
00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:23.610
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that could've just been a shitty plane.</v>

393
00:18:25.330 --> 00:18:26.163
<v Speaker 1>He was that much.</v>

394
00:18:26.370 --> 00:18:30.060
<v Speaker 2>That sounds like a dried,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure that violet absolutely told us</v>

395
00:18:30.061 --> 00:18:31.080
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

396
00:18:31.081 --> 00:18:32.000
<v Speaker 2>Like he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

397
00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:33.020
<v Speaker 2>get the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

398
00:18:33.030 --> 00:18:35.760
<v Speaker 2>the stuff gets a little fritzy up here</v>
<v Speaker 2>over the Bermuda triangle.</v>

399
00:18:35.761 --> 00:18:37.460
<v Speaker 2>We're buying it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just a shitty lane.</v>

400
00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:39.930
<v Speaker 2>And he didn't like the service or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

401
00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:40.890
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>

402
00:18:40.891 --> 00:18:44.820
<v Speaker 2>you just killed my story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I might be naive in believing that.</v>

403
00:18:44.930 --> 00:18:45.580
<v Speaker 2>Like this whole thing</v>

404
00:18:45.580 --> 00:18:45.961
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

405
00:18:45.961 --> 00:18:47.690
<v Speaker 1>it's just a shitty plane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could be shit.</v>

406
00:18:47.710 --> 00:18:50.040
<v Speaker 1>They'll still play in the shitty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

407
00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:51.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what they think.</v>

408
00:18:51.390 --> 00:18:54.330
<v Speaker 1>That's the most prevalent theory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would think.</v>

409
00:18:54.331 --> 00:18:57.360
<v Speaker 1>You'd die if that bubble hit you just</v>
<v Speaker 1>from a lot of it,</v>

410
00:18:57.361 --> 00:18:57.961
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

411
00:18:57.961 --> 00:19:00.450
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever seen those underwater</v>

412
00:19:00.451 --> 00:19:03.180
<v Speaker 1>lakes of methane?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's creepy.</v>

413
00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:04.930
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so water underwater,</v>

414
00:19:05.010 --> 00:19:05.930
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

415
00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:07.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

416
00:19:07.141 --> 00:19:11.070
<v Speaker 1>it's the ocean is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty bizarre that it's just right</v>

417
00:19:11.071 --> 00:19:13.020
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's essentially an alien world.</v>

418
00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:16.980
<v Speaker 1>Like I've always said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the ocean is really like space,</v>

419
00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:21.060
<v Speaker 1>like spaces like above us all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the ocean is kind of just like</v>

420
00:19:21.061 --> 00:19:22.410
<v Speaker 1>space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's right there,</v>

421
00:19:22.530 --> 00:19:24.330
<v Speaker 1>you can go in and that's a whole nother</v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

422
00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:26.850
<v Speaker 1>It's like a whole nother world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's on our earth,</v>

423
00:19:27.030 --> 00:19:28.650
<v Speaker 1>but we're just so used to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

424
00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:29.910
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's go surfing.</v>

425
00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:31.140
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's get in the boat.</v>

426
00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:33.870
<v Speaker 1>Floating around some fucking alien</v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

427
00:19:33.871 --> 00:19:36.060
<v Speaker 1>It's right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's filled with life.</v>

428
00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:40.020
<v Speaker 1>All sorts of life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That actually breeds water like yeah,</v>

429
00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:42.510
<v Speaker 1>came from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

430
00:19:42.511 --> 00:19:44.340
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was talking about it with my,</v>

431
00:19:44.510 --> 00:19:46.350
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that the lakes of methane underwater?</v>

432
00:19:46.351 --> 00:19:48.880
<v Speaker 1>That's nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so God damn,</v>

433
00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:50.580
<v Speaker 1>that is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

434
00:19:50.610 --> 00:19:54.150
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go by the lake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just took a run around the shore.</v>

435
00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:56.760
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't even look real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like they're going around silver</v>

436
00:19:56.761 --> 00:19:59.070
<v Speaker 1>lake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's that email is just like cruising</v>

437
00:19:59.071 --> 00:20:01.410
<v Speaker 1>around silver lake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a methane lake.</v>

438
00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:04.770
<v Speaker 1>What was that movie where like is</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably a methane lake too,</v>

439
00:20:04.771 --> 00:20:07.150
<v Speaker 1>but it's been in other ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

440
00:20:07.530 --> 00:20:11.160
<v Speaker 1>What was that movie where there was</v>
<v Speaker 1>aliens underwater?</v>

441
00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:12.420
<v Speaker 1>The abyss.</v>

442
00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:13.530
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

443
00:20:13.530 --> 00:20:14.363
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

444
00:20:14.930 --> 00:20:19.280
<v Speaker 1>Drowned to survive any us to re assess</v>
<v Speaker 1>the tater.</v>

445
00:20:19.330 --> 00:20:20.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

446
00:20:20.961 --> 00:20:23.780
<v Speaker 1>and they were like aliens was assumed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The shape of water.</v>

447
00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:25.490
<v Speaker 1>What's it called?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Aliens and the deep,</v>

448
00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:27.740
<v Speaker 1>hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's probably the best though.</v>

449
00:20:27.950 --> 00:20:30.080
<v Speaker 1>I think it's the best and they were sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of pink too.</v>

450
00:20:30.081 --> 00:20:32.000
<v Speaker 1>They were the same colors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My ball lightning.</v>

451
00:20:32.270 --> 00:20:34.250
<v Speaker 1>Remember that pink from the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

452
00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:38.120
<v Speaker 1>The only guy that ever talked to when I</v>
<v Speaker 1>was talking to this Ufo people that I</v>

453
00:20:38.121 --> 00:20:42.020
<v Speaker 1>believed about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ufos was a guy who was that skin walker</v>

454
00:20:42.021 --> 00:20:44.610
<v Speaker 1>ranch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That whole area out there has a shitload</v>

455
00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:46.060
<v Speaker 1>of Ufo sightings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>scanning locker,</v>

456
00:20:46.070 --> 00:20:48.010
<v Speaker 1>ranch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's some place that</v>

457
00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:51.820
<v Speaker 3>this Guy Robert Bigelow owns and he is</v>
<v Speaker 3>an,</v>

458
00:20:52.150 --> 00:20:57.150
<v Speaker 3>what makes it compelling is he actually</v>
<v Speaker 3>is an aerospace investor and he's got a</v>

459
00:20:57.490 --> 00:21:02.490
<v Speaker 3>company that makes all these parts and</v>
<v Speaker 3>shit for different spaceships and</v>

460
00:21:03.221 --> 00:21:05.770
<v Speaker 3>different pods and things too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

461
00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:07.570
<v Speaker 3>Why does he do immune?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's his business,</v>

462
00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:11.710
<v Speaker 3>but he also owns this gigantic ranch in</v>
<v Speaker 3>Utah and we went out to visit them,</v>

463
00:21:12.490 --> 00:21:15.200
<v Speaker 3>visit the ranch and visit some of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>people around there that,</v>

464
00:21:15.650 --> 00:21:19.570
<v Speaker 3>and one guy that we talked to that lived</v>
<v Speaker 3>around there was just regular dude.</v>

465
00:21:19.571 --> 00:21:22.150
<v Speaker 3>I think he worked in a factory,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just regular guy,</v>

466
00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:24.010
<v Speaker 3>not crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but super normal.</v>

467
00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:26.200
<v Speaker 3>Like talk to him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not a bullshit artist at all.</v>

468
00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:30.460
<v Speaker 3>And he's telling me about this glowing</v>
<v Speaker 3>orb that came through the walls of his</v>

469
00:21:30.461 --> 00:21:34.180
<v Speaker 3>house and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and floated around inside of his living</v>

470
00:21:34.181 --> 00:21:36.640
<v Speaker 3>room and kitchen and then took off</v>
<v Speaker 3>through the wall.</v>

471
00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:37.900
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>

472
00:21:38.140 --> 00:21:41.500
<v Speaker 3>like the way he described it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I absolutely believe that he was telling</v>

473
00:21:41.501 --> 00:21:43.780
<v Speaker 3>me the truth and I think that was ball</v>
<v Speaker 3>lightning.</v>

474
00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:47.410
<v Speaker 3>I think we have it a lot in that area.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I think whatever the atmosphere</v>

475
00:21:47.411 --> 00:21:49.810
<v Speaker 3>conditions in that area,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a frequent occurrence.</v>

476
00:21:49.811 --> 00:21:52.070
<v Speaker 3>And because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of these people see things and</v>

477
00:21:52.090 --> 00:21:54.760
<v Speaker 3>they start talking and then people start</v>
<v Speaker 3>looking for him and then they start</v>

478
00:21:54.761 --> 00:21:57.580
<v Speaker 3>talking crazy and then people start</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about like they were talking</v>

479
00:21:57.581 --> 00:21:59.920
<v Speaker 3>about a bullet proof wolf that appeared</v>
<v Speaker 3>out of mist.</v>

480
00:21:59.921 --> 00:22:02.680
<v Speaker 3>And like for real,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was like an got that out front.</v>

481
00:22:02.770 --> 00:22:03.650
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Werewolf greeter.</v>

482
00:22:04.810 --> 00:22:07.180
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

483
00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:09.160
<v Speaker 3>But this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy was the only guy that made</v>

484
00:22:09.161 --> 00:22:12.040
<v Speaker 3>sense and I think he saw ball lightning</v>
<v Speaker 3>just like you did.</v>

485
00:22:12.070 --> 00:22:13.630
<v Speaker 3>How could it be on the ground?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that</v>

486
00:22:15.130 --> 00:22:16.120
<v Speaker 3>could just happen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

487
00:22:16.121 --> 00:22:17.950
<v Speaker 3>if there's a storm conditions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it does,</v>

488
00:22:18.010 --> 00:22:20.680
<v Speaker 3>it occurs not just up in the sky.</v>

489
00:22:20.770 --> 00:22:23.800
<v Speaker 3>It occurs at low altitude as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

490
00:22:23.801 --> 00:22:25.090
<v Speaker 3>they say ball.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't know why.</v>

491
00:22:25.091 --> 00:22:27.430
<v Speaker 3>But apparently I talked to a scientist</v>
<v Speaker 3>about this.</v>

492
00:22:27.670 --> 00:22:30.430
<v Speaker 3>He was telling me that lightning</v>
<v Speaker 3>shouldn't be possible.</v>

493
00:22:30.850 --> 00:22:33.850
<v Speaker 3>Like there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's shouldn't be enough power to</v>

494
00:22:33.851 --> 00:22:35.020
<v Speaker 3>create lightning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's like,</v>

495
00:22:35.021 --> 00:22:36.460
<v Speaker 3>if you do the calculations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>

496
00:22:36.461 --> 00:22:39.640
<v Speaker 3>but clearly we know it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what do we do about that?</v>

497
00:22:39.790 --> 00:22:41.980
<v Speaker 3>We don't really know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't know enough about lightening.</v>

498
00:22:41.981 --> 00:22:43.900
<v Speaker 3>So when you describe ball lightning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>

499
00:22:43.901 --> 00:22:46.030
<v Speaker 3>well good fucking luck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who knows who,</v>

500
00:22:46.031 --> 00:22:47.980
<v Speaker 3>what are the atmosphere?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't know enough about it.</v>

501
00:22:47.981 --> 00:22:49.240
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't know what the conditions are</v>

502
00:22:49.241 --> 00:22:49.960
<v Speaker 3>like what?</v>

503
00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:51.610
<v Speaker 2>What does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's not enough energy for</v>

504
00:22:51.611 --> 00:22:52.421
<v Speaker 2>lightening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can't,</v>

505
00:22:52.421 --> 00:22:54.880
<v Speaker 2>you can't marshal that much electricity</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the atmosphere.</v>

506
00:22:55.110 --> 00:22:58.470
<v Speaker 3>I'm too stupid to repeat what he said</v>
<v Speaker 3>and have it make any sense.</v>

507
00:22:58.471 --> 00:23:02.340
<v Speaker 3>But when he was describing it to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way he was explaining it,</v>

508
00:23:02.341 --> 00:23:04.290
<v Speaker 3>and I think I read it as well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was,</v>

509
00:23:04.830 --> 00:23:09.540
<v Speaker 3>he was explaining and what I read was</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they don't really understand how</v>

510
00:23:09.541 --> 00:23:14.541
<v Speaker 3>that much energy is produced in the sky</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that and that if you calculated</v>

511
00:23:15.990 --> 00:23:19.740
<v Speaker 3>like what it would take to produce</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

512
00:23:19.770 --> 00:23:22.320
<v Speaker 3>that shouldn't be possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>

513
00:23:22.710 --> 00:23:23.543
<v Speaker 3>I'm a moron.</v>

514
00:23:24.090 --> 00:23:24.560
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

515
00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:26.930
<v Speaker 2>I wished a real expert were here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wish I was like,</v>

516
00:23:26.931 --> 00:23:27.800
<v Speaker 2>that's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

517
00:23:28.060 --> 00:23:29.360
<v Speaker 3>So he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with this guy was described,</v>

518
00:23:29.361 --> 00:23:32.080
<v Speaker 3>it was talking about ball lightning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We were saying they don't know how to</v>

519
00:23:32.081 --> 00:23:33.730
<v Speaker 3>recreate ball lightning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

520
00:23:33.790 --> 00:23:35.620
<v Speaker 3>they have no idea what causes it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there are,</v>

521
00:23:35.621 --> 00:23:36.700
<v Speaker 3>sure it's a real thing.</v>

522
00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:39.630
<v Speaker 2>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can't recreate ball lightning in a</v>

523
00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:42.090
<v Speaker 2>lab environment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe so.</v>

524
00:23:42.750 --> 00:23:43.950
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

525
00:23:44.350 --> 00:23:45.380
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they can it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

526
00:23:45.381 --> 00:23:48.230
<v Speaker 2>you're right because we can't generate</v>
<v Speaker 2>that amount of power.</v>

527
00:23:48.890 --> 00:23:51.320
<v Speaker 2>We literally can't gender,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean maybe with a bomb,</v>

528
00:23:51.321 --> 00:23:54.860
<v Speaker 2>but we can't generate that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea.</v>

529
00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:56.030
<v Speaker 2>I think we can't.</v>

530
00:23:56.150 --> 00:23:57.370
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's what a lot of people are</v>

531
00:23:57.371 --> 00:23:59.770
<v Speaker 3>seeing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think these people that see things and</v>

532
00:23:59.771 --> 00:24:02.380
<v Speaker 3>then also the human imagination is so</v>
<v Speaker 3>fantastic.</v>

533
00:24:02.381 --> 00:24:04.840
<v Speaker 3>Your memory's all fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Memory's terrible.</v>

534
00:24:05.110 --> 00:24:06.610
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you see something and then you</v>

535
00:24:06.611 --> 00:24:08.710
<v Speaker 3>decided something different when you see</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

536
00:24:08.950 --> 00:24:12.540
<v Speaker 3>I talked to another lady told me she saw</v>
<v Speaker 3>big foot and she wasn't a book.</v>

537
00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:16.150
<v Speaker 3>She didn't seem like a bullshit artist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She seemed like she was being a hundred</v>

538
00:24:16.150 --> 00:24:17.950
<v Speaker 3>percent honest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She didn't seem like she needed a ton of</v>

539
00:24:17.951 --> 00:24:20.230
<v Speaker 3>attention.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She didn't seem crazy and I think she</v>

540
00:24:20.231 --> 00:24:23.050
<v Speaker 3>saw bear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just think she saw a bear way in the</v>

541
00:24:23.051 --> 00:24:26.320
<v Speaker 3>distance and she saw it very briefly</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it was the Pacific northwest and</v>

542
00:24:26.321 --> 00:24:27.580
<v Speaker 3>trees are very dense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thick.</v>

543
00:24:27.581 --> 00:24:30.070
<v Speaker 3>She saw a big,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it might even been on two legs,</v>

544
00:24:30.071 --> 00:24:33.850
<v Speaker 3>cause bears do do that all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think she saw that and in her mind</v>

545
00:24:33.851 --> 00:24:35.350
<v Speaker 3>she saw a gorilla.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>

546
00:24:35.351 --> 00:24:36.700
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why am I looking at a gorilla?</v>

547
00:24:36.701 --> 00:24:40.330
<v Speaker 3>And then she had this story that just</v>
<v Speaker 3>got concocted in her head and she saw</v>

548
00:24:40.331 --> 00:24:41.080
<v Speaker 3>Saskia</v>

549
00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:42.190
<v Speaker 2>that happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

550
00:24:42.191 --> 00:24:42.890
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

551
00:24:42.890 --> 00:24:46.320
<v Speaker 2>I'm convinced of certain things and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>I find out I'm completely wrong.</v>

552
00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:47.350
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it does happen.</v>

553
00:24:48.340 --> 00:24:50.720
<v Speaker 2>I told you that you better back off the</v>
<v Speaker 2>ghost.</v>

554
00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:53.680
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to believe a great deal.</v>

555
00:24:53.681 --> 00:24:58.681
<v Speaker 2>I still pretty much believe pretty much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think basically this is my entire</v>

556
00:24:59.621 --> 00:25:04.621
<v Speaker 2>philosophy on all weirdnesses okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you look back 500 years to what they</v>

557
00:25:04.841 --> 00:25:08.290
<v Speaker 2>knew scientifically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it's superstitious.</v>

558
00:25:08.291 --> 00:25:09.790
<v Speaker 2>It's magic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's ridiculous,</v>

559
00:25:09.791 --> 00:25:11.040
<v Speaker 2>it's ignorant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>et Cetera,</v>

560
00:25:11.041 --> 00:25:13.240
<v Speaker 2>et cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe that that's exactly what we</v>

561
00:25:13.241 --> 00:25:17.890
<v Speaker 2>are now to 500 years in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I don't consider it paranormal.</v>

562
00:25:17.891 --> 00:25:21.520
<v Speaker 2>I consider it future science goes her</v>
<v Speaker 2>future science,</v>

563
00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:24.760
<v Speaker 2>go surf future science,</v>
<v Speaker 2>aliens or future science.</v>

564
00:25:24.761 --> 00:25:27.100
<v Speaker 2>It's all future science.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm down for that.</v>

565
00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:29.770
<v Speaker 2>I'm ready to party with the future</v>
<v Speaker 2>science.</v>

566
00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:31.660
<v Speaker 3>I'm ready for that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Accept that.</v>

567
00:25:32.190 --> 00:25:34.540
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my problem is the people that tell ghost</v>

568
00:25:34.541 --> 00:25:37.700
<v Speaker 3>stories or those fucking go shows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's so,</v>

569
00:25:38.890 --> 00:25:41.640
<v Speaker 2>there's so faked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so painfully faith.</v>

570
00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:45.430
<v Speaker 2>I really believed it for a while.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I really absolutely bought into it.</v>

571
00:25:45.431 --> 00:25:46.380
<v Speaker 2>Hook,</v>
<v Speaker 2>line and sinker.</v>

572
00:25:46.420 --> 00:25:48.850
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're watching the little there,</v>

573
00:25:48.851 --> 00:25:50.470
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's all different kinds of ghosts.</v>

574
00:25:50.471 --> 00:25:51.940
<v Speaker 2>Like the ones that look like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

575
00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:53.620
<v Speaker 2>he walks or none.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He walks,</v>

576
00:25:53.710 --> 00:25:57.580
<v Speaker 2>which are the ones that are the jet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first movie star wars.</v>

577
00:25:57.581 --> 00:26:00.580
<v Speaker 2>And they like where they're little robes</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they were busy.</v>

578
00:26:00.610 --> 00:26:02.320
<v Speaker 2>They were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

579
00:26:02.410 --> 00:26:04.270
<v Speaker 2>you know the first ones that loot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>

580
00:26:04.750 --> 00:26:06.550
<v Speaker 2>we're selling route robotics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

581
00:26:06.551 --> 00:26:10.120
<v Speaker 2>They didn't really have faces.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just had like cloaks the robot</v>

582
00:26:10.121 --> 00:26:12.370
<v Speaker 2>sellers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well apparently there are ghosts that</v>

583
00:26:12.371 --> 00:26:16.840
<v Speaker 2>are little cloak creatures and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>scare the crap out of me.</v>

584
00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:21.240
<v Speaker 2>They move fast and I don't understand</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they're doing here.</v>

585
00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:24.010
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean you can explain demons.</v>

586
00:26:24.011 --> 00:26:27.250
<v Speaker 2>You can explain demons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you think about like dog ghosts or</v>

587
00:26:27.251 --> 00:26:30.880
<v Speaker 2>wolf ghosts or lion ghosts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a demon.</v>

588
00:26:31.210 --> 00:26:32.560
<v Speaker 2>Could be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they growl.</v>

589
00:26:32.561 --> 00:26:35.440
<v Speaker 2>They have like weird eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're hostile.</v>

590
00:26:35.441 --> 00:26:38.020
<v Speaker 2>They scratch you animal.</v>

591
00:26:38.620 --> 00:26:41.650
<v Speaker 3>So you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have a real belief in ghosts.</v>

592
00:26:42.370 --> 00:26:45.900
<v Speaker 2>The treanda kind of like not 100% but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're,</v>

593
00:26:45.901 --> 00:26:49.020
<v Speaker 2>you have an open wide bump into them</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes a week.</v>

594
00:26:49.350 --> 00:26:52.770
<v Speaker 2>And I don't see them but I feel them and</v>
<v Speaker 2>hear them and that like,</v>

595
00:26:53.190 --> 00:26:54.050
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go ahead.</v>

596
00:26:54.330 --> 00:26:57.720
<v Speaker 2>Oh little smile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That little smile.</v>

597
00:26:57.721 --> 00:27:01.200
<v Speaker 2>That's why we're talking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause we're on the weirdness podcasts,</v>

598
00:27:01.230 --> 00:27:05.760
<v Speaker 2>but like I don't talk about it cause it</v>
<v Speaker 2>just doesn't get a good response.</v>

599
00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:07.970
<v Speaker 3>Blinded.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when you bought,</v>

600
00:27:07.971 --> 00:27:09.890
<v Speaker 3>I believe you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't seem like a liar by any</v>

601
00:27:09.891 --> 00:27:10.910
<v Speaker 3>stretch of the imagination,</v>

602
00:27:11.020 --> 00:27:12.640
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I have a huge imagination.</v>

603
00:27:12.670 --> 00:27:16.030
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure you do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could very easily have been tricking</v>

604
00:27:16.031 --> 00:27:18.760
<v Speaker 2>myself into something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you feel what happens?</v>

605
00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:21.930
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just bump into that and they just,</v>

606
00:27:22.110 --> 00:27:27.030
<v Speaker 2>if you walk into a room,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it happens maybe once a year.</v>

607
00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:29.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you walk into a room,</v>

608
00:27:29.251 --> 00:27:32.880
<v Speaker 2>you walk somewhere or something's going</v>
<v Speaker 2>on and you just feel it and it's a very,</v>

609
00:27:32.881 --> 00:27:35.220
<v Speaker 2>very strong and you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

610
00:27:35.250 --> 00:27:38.820
<v Speaker 2>I talked to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just say like it mostly hotel rooms.</v>

611
00:27:38.850 --> 00:27:42.720
<v Speaker 2>Let's just say if I'm in a hotel room on</v>
<v Speaker 2>tour and I led their move,</v>

612
00:27:42.721 --> 00:27:45.870
<v Speaker 2>if I don't like it or I'll just say</v>
<v Speaker 2>alone in that room,</v>

613
00:27:45.871 --> 00:27:46.830
<v Speaker 2>I'll be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hi,</v>

614
00:27:47.230 --> 00:27:52.230
<v Speaker 2>I'm playing a show at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm only here for two days,</v>

615
00:27:52.331 --> 00:27:54.450
<v Speaker 2>but I really need to get some sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

616
00:27:54.490 --> 00:27:56.530
<v Speaker 2>you can come to this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tell them they can come to the show if</v>

617
00:27:56.531 --> 00:27:58.120
<v Speaker 2>they want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

618
00:27:58.121 --> 00:28:01.750
<v Speaker 2>this is what I do for a living.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I try to like hear and think what</v>

619
00:28:01.751 --> 00:28:02.580
<v Speaker 2>they do for a living.</v>

620
00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:04.500
<v Speaker 3>I would be psyched if I was a ghost and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I found you.</v>

621
00:28:04.501 --> 00:28:05.560
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this chick's cool.</v>

622
00:28:07.190 --> 00:28:09.160
<v Speaker 2>How do you want to scare?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let her sleep,</v>

623
00:28:09.161 --> 00:28:10.090
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let her sleep.</v>

624
00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:12.940
<v Speaker 2>Fuck down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got the pots and pans ready to make a</v>

625
00:28:12.941 --> 00:28:16.010
<v Speaker 2>racket.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nah Man,</v>

626
00:28:16.030 --> 00:28:17.410
<v Speaker 2>let her sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's cool.</v>

627
00:28:17.411 --> 00:28:19.480
<v Speaker 2>It's go to the show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I put 'em on my guest list.</v>

628
00:28:20.020 --> 00:28:22.240
<v Speaker 2>He's got a plus one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's nice.</v>

629
00:28:22.450 --> 00:28:24.700
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to reserve a seat for</v>
<v Speaker 2>everywhere.</v>

630
00:28:26.900 --> 00:28:29.810
<v Speaker 3>Obviously you have an active</v>
<v Speaker 3>imagination.</v>

631
00:28:29.990 --> 00:28:33.890
<v Speaker 3>And do you think that maybe your mind</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking yourself at the time?</v>

632
00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:34.820
<v Speaker 3>Like when you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

633
00:28:34.821 --> 00:28:36.920
<v Speaker 3>you're talking out loud,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are you doing it because it's comforting</v>

634
00:28:37.100 --> 00:28:37.933
<v Speaker 3>because you enjoy it?</v>

635
00:28:38.010 --> 00:28:39.030
<v Speaker 2>Probably,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

636
00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:43.530
<v Speaker 2>but if you asked me on a lie detector</v>
<v Speaker 2>test whether I think I really</v>

637
00:28:43.531 --> 00:28:47.100
<v Speaker 2>encountered something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd say yes for sure.</v>

638
00:28:47.970 --> 00:28:49.680
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's been enough experiences in my</v>

639
00:28:49.681 --> 00:28:53.160
<v Speaker 2>life that it just seems like just part</v>
<v Speaker 2>of future science.</v>

640
00:28:53.430 --> 00:28:57.010
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a guy named Rupert Sheldrick,</v>

641
00:28:57.130 --> 00:28:59.470
<v Speaker 3>he's a scientist and he believes that</v>
<v Speaker 3>things have memory.</v>

642
00:28:59.740 --> 00:29:01.690
<v Speaker 3>He thinks that everything has memory</v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

643
00:29:01.691 --> 00:29:03.970
<v Speaker 3>That's why people don't want to live in</v>
<v Speaker 3>haunted houses.</v>

644
00:29:04.390 --> 00:29:05.740
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't want to live in a house where</v>

645
00:29:05.741 --> 00:29:08.200
<v Speaker 3>someone died.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He thinks that objects have memory.</v>

646
00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:11.080
<v Speaker 3>They can't express it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that they have it.</v>

647
00:29:11.690 --> 00:29:13.070
<v Speaker 2>I agree with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It might be.</v>

648
00:29:13.460 --> 00:29:14.293
<v Speaker 2>We like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we haven't,</v>

649
00:29:14.510 --> 00:29:16.940
<v Speaker 2>I think it's less the object retaining</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

650
00:29:16.970 --> 00:29:18.710
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it must be retaining something.</v>

651
00:29:18.860 --> 00:29:23.810
<v Speaker 2>I think it's more our psychic ability to</v>
<v Speaker 2>perceive the past.</v>

652
00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:25.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what I think.</v>

653
00:29:25.790 --> 00:29:30.790
<v Speaker 2>I think it's more like you see the chair</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you can psychically feel what</v>

654
00:29:34.131 --> 00:29:36.410
<v Speaker 2>happened in that chair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not really sure how to like,</v>

655
00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:39.700
<v Speaker 2>you're not seeing the chair imbued with</v>
<v Speaker 2>some aura.</v>

656
00:29:39.890 --> 00:29:42.400
<v Speaker 2>You're actually looking into the past.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

657
00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:45.760
<v Speaker 2>that's what I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause I've had dreams that were like</v>

658
00:29:45.761 --> 00:29:47.010
<v Speaker 2>prefiguring</v>

659
00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:51.930
<v Speaker 2>I think you can dream if something's</v>
<v Speaker 2>impactful enough.</v>

660
00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:54.450
<v Speaker 2>I think you can dream.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

661
00:29:54.540 --> 00:29:56.220
<v Speaker 2>Let's say something really bad happens</v>
<v Speaker 2>to you.</v>

662
00:29:56.250 --> 00:29:57.830
<v Speaker 2>Imagine something horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

663
00:29:58.140 --> 00:29:59.820
<v Speaker 2>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this studio explodes</v>

664
00:30:01.410 --> 00:30:06.180
<v Speaker 2>a couple months.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe before then you might have a</v>

665
00:30:06.181 --> 00:30:07.080
<v Speaker 2>dream.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

666
00:30:07.081 --> 00:30:09.390
<v Speaker 2>let's just say something goes really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really wrong or bad.</v>

667
00:30:10.170 --> 00:30:14.430
<v Speaker 2>Nothing traumatic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You might be able to have a dream ahead</v>

668
00:30:14.431 --> 00:30:17.970
<v Speaker 2>of time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That would be how you would synthesize</v>

669
00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:22.710
<v Speaker 2>that traumatic experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just as if it had happened before and</v>

670
00:30:22.711 --> 00:30:27.330
<v Speaker 2>you were dreaming after the fact before</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've had that happen.</v>

671
00:30:27.660 --> 00:30:29.040
<v Speaker 2>I have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I would happen with,</v>

672
00:30:30.510 --> 00:30:31.343
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

673
00:30:34.450 --> 00:30:37.730
<v Speaker 2>I'm saving that for my book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that okay?</v>

674
00:30:38.380 --> 00:30:40.350
<v Speaker 2>It's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it was a very powerful,</v>

675
00:30:40.370 --> 00:30:41.320
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

676
00:30:41.330 --> 00:30:44.560
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

677
00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:47.880
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it was very convincing to me and</v>

678
00:30:48.310 --> 00:30:51.550
<v Speaker 2>hard to explain any other way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever had any other sort of</v>

679
00:30:51.551 --> 00:30:54.040
<v Speaker 2>psychic premonition?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

680
00:30:54.790 --> 00:30:56.890
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember the last big fire we had</v>

681
00:30:56.891 --> 00:30:59.260
<v Speaker 2>in la when it was like encroaching</v>
<v Speaker 2>recently?</v>

682
00:30:59.430 --> 00:31:00.263
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that one.</v>

683
00:31:00.660 --> 00:31:04.000
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the night before that fire I was out</v>

684
00:31:04.001 --> 00:31:06.160
<v Speaker 2>walking with my son again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my son,</v>

685
00:31:06.161 --> 00:31:08.470
<v Speaker 2>he's like all over this podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why,</v>

686
00:31:08.471 --> 00:31:10.840
<v Speaker 2>cause he barely speaks to me at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>moment and he's like,</v>

687
00:31:10.841 --> 00:31:11.321
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

688
00:31:11.321 --> 00:31:12.580
<v Speaker 2>fine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good talk to you later.</v>

689
00:31:13.210 --> 00:31:18.190
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I just felt incredibly uneasy and he</v>

690
00:31:18.191 --> 00:31:21.340
<v Speaker 2>suffered from asthma when he was young</v>
<v Speaker 2>and really badly.</v>

691
00:31:21.341 --> 00:31:25.180
<v Speaker 2>So when it would be when there was a lot</v>
<v Speaker 2>of particulate matter in the air,</v>

692
00:31:25.181 --> 00:31:29.920
<v Speaker 2>or if it was just bad air conditions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would tend to be very worried about</v>

693
00:31:29.921 --> 00:31:34.921
<v Speaker 2>him and keep him home or informed the</v>
<v Speaker 2>teachers or whatever it was just he'd</v>

694
00:31:35.170 --> 00:31:36.670
<v Speaker 2>get really bad asthma attacks.</v>

695
00:31:37.420 --> 00:31:40.540
<v Speaker 2>And so I have a predisposition to be on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the alert,</v>

696
00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:43.630
<v Speaker 2>but this is the night before no fire had</v>
<v Speaker 2>started yet.</v>

697
00:31:44.170 --> 00:31:47.710
<v Speaker 2>And I just was very anxious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very anxious,</v>

698
00:31:47.711 --> 00:31:51.220
<v Speaker 2>and I couldn't settle down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I couldn't think for months.</v>

699
00:31:51.310 --> 00:31:52.720
<v Speaker 2>I hadn't been like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

700
00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:54.490
<v Speaker 2>and I said to him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

701
00:31:54.970 --> 00:31:57.490
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I feel kind of unsafe.</v>

702
00:31:57.730 --> 00:32:00.940
<v Speaker 2>If something happens tomorrow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to like,</v>

703
00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:05.020
<v Speaker 2>you have to be my witness that I sensed</v>
<v Speaker 2>something was coming.</v>

704
00:32:05.021 --> 00:32:07.240
<v Speaker 2>Now you probably think I'm this horrible</v>
<v Speaker 2>mother,</v>

705
00:32:07.241 --> 00:32:11.140
<v Speaker 2>I never do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It happens like I think I've like said</v>

706
00:32:11.141 --> 00:32:14.650
<v Speaker 2>that to him twice in our entire life and</v>

707
00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:19.820
<v Speaker 2>I forgot about it and the next day I</v>
<v Speaker 2>forgot about it.</v>

708
00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:22.250
<v Speaker 2>I didn't think about it at all until,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

709
00:32:22.251 --> 00:32:27.251
<v Speaker 2>we were socked in in a sort of Brown</v>
<v Speaker 2>muck as we are and like the sun became</v>

710
00:32:27.411 --> 00:32:29.780
<v Speaker 2>the eye of Sauron and ever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

711
00:32:29.781 --> 00:32:32.870
<v Speaker 2>everyone's like freaking out and we're</v>
<v Speaker 2>looking at all these images and I was so</v>

712
00:32:32.871 --> 00:32:36.470
<v Speaker 2>distracted by all these images that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>completely forgot my sense the night</v>

713
00:32:36.471 --> 00:32:40.460
<v Speaker 2>before and what I think that was until I</v>
<v Speaker 2>remembered it.</v>

714
00:32:40.461 --> 00:32:41.930
<v Speaker 2>Then I called up and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ah.</v>

715
00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:47.420
<v Speaker 2>And I think it's more like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know something's coming,</v>

716
00:32:47.810 --> 00:32:52.730
<v Speaker 2>but I have maybe time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe the envelope with time is a little</v>

717
00:32:52.731 --> 00:32:57.290
<v Speaker 2>bit more mushy than we think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe we perceive time is very orderly</v>

718
00:32:57.291 --> 00:33:00.890
<v Speaker 2>and very linear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but maybe it's really not.</v>

719
00:33:01.340 --> 00:33:05.030
<v Speaker 2>And it could be pushing back like the</v>
<v Speaker 2>experience and maybe I had the</v>

720
00:33:05.031 --> 00:33:07.910
<v Speaker 2>experience before I perceive the</v>
<v Speaker 2>experience or I don't know what that is,</v>

721
00:33:07.911 --> 00:33:09.800
<v Speaker 2>but that happens to me a lot.</v>

722
00:33:10.980 --> 00:33:12.420
<v Speaker 1>I've heard people describe,</v>

723
00:33:12.660 --> 00:33:13.590
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he likes hearing about it.</v>

724
00:33:13.591 --> 00:33:15.870
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never talk about this stuff in my real</v>

725
00:33:15.871 --> 00:33:19.560
<v Speaker 2>life because nobody likes it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean it makes people</v>

726
00:33:19.561 --> 00:33:21.600
<v Speaker 2>uncomfortable and they look at you</v>
<v Speaker 2>funny,</v>

727
00:33:21.601 --> 00:33:23.610
<v Speaker 2>so I just never talk about it except for</v>
<v Speaker 2>on</v>

728
00:33:23.950 --> 00:33:26.000
<v Speaker 1>the podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

729
00:33:26.860 --> 00:33:28.930
<v Speaker 1>Why would it make them uncomfortable?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just does.</v>

730
00:33:28.990 --> 00:33:31.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm fascinated by that because I don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience it and I'm not,</v>

731
00:33:31.931 --> 00:33:34.090
<v Speaker 1>I've never had a premonition that came</v>
<v Speaker 1>true,</v>

732
00:33:34.270 --> 00:33:39.100
<v Speaker 1>but I do have a really good ability to</v>
<v Speaker 1>know if someone's crazy.</v>

733
00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:41.590
<v Speaker 1>I'm really good at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apparently I'm not.</v>

734
00:33:41.740 --> 00:33:42.573
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not crazy.</v>

735
00:33:42.670 --> 00:33:43.031
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

736
00:33:43.031 --> 00:33:47.950
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if someone's of crazy</v>
<v Speaker 1>people blind spot.</v>

737
00:33:49.900 --> 00:33:52.180
<v Speaker 1>That's where he could pick out fires in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the distance,</v>

738
00:33:52.750 --> 00:33:54.450
<v Speaker 1>but you can't pick out nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

739
00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:57.490
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have any psychic ability though.</v>

740
00:33:58.060 --> 00:33:58.893
<v Speaker 1>I've just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think just,</v>

741
00:34:00.650 --> 00:34:03.670
<v Speaker 1>I don't if you can tell if someone's</v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy or not,</v>

742
00:34:03.700 --> 00:34:04.860
<v Speaker 1>you might have some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

743
00:34:04.861 --> 00:34:09.861
<v Speaker 1>you might have some perception and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>think it's pattern recognition and data</v>

744
00:34:11.381 --> 00:34:12.220
<v Speaker 1>chunking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I've met so many people.</v>

746
00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:17.500
<v Speaker 1>Then when I see things that are off</v>
<v Speaker 1>little things that are off and you</v>

747

<v Speaker 1>mask.</v>

00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:32.350
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>30 years of watching people drank really</v>

814
00:36:32.351 --> 00:36:33.640
<v Speaker 2>sucked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

815
00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.070
<v Speaker 2>I was never much into alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

816
00:36:36.100 --> 00:36:37.710
<v Speaker 2>I prefer marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

817
00:36:38.410 --> 00:36:40.900
<v Speaker 2>Well you're a sensitive person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It makes you more sensitive.</v>

818
00:36:41.650 --> 00:36:42.910
<v Speaker 2>Marijuana does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

819
00:36:43.060 --> 00:36:43.893
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think so</v>

820
00:36:44.020 --> 00:36:45.760
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes you more aware,</v>

821
00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:47.280
<v Speaker 1>more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

822
00:36:47.850 --> 00:36:51.640
<v Speaker 1>consider it thinking about more</v>
<v Speaker 1>possibilities.</v>

823
00:36:51.641 --> 00:36:53.560
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's what people call paranoia</v>
<v Speaker 1>really.</v>

824
00:36:53.561 --> 00:36:56.410
<v Speaker 1>It's like a lot of times people live</v>
<v Speaker 1>with blinders on and marijuana just</v>

825
00:36:56.411 --> 00:36:57.244
<v Speaker 1>comes along and goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

826
00:36:57.250 --> 00:37:01.420
<v Speaker 1>let's just take those over and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>puts a spotlight and like,</v>

827
00:37:01.421 --> 00:37:02.590
<v Speaker 1>look at the back of your brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

828
00:37:02.591 --> 00:37:03.740
<v Speaker 1>look at this shit you're hiding.</v>

829
00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:06.050
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>

830
00:37:06.051 --> 00:37:08.300
<v Speaker 2>It's like shining a flashlight into your</v>
<v Speaker 2>unconscious.</v>

831
00:37:08.301 --> 00:37:09.540
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you do what's back there?</v>

832
00:37:09.580 --> 00:37:13.160
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh cool.</v>

833
00:37:13.170 --> 00:37:14.900
<v Speaker 2>Let's get a look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's talk to it.</v>

834
00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:17.450
<v Speaker 2>That is what the paranoia is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree with that.</v>

835
00:37:17.451 --> 00:37:20.870
<v Speaker 2>It's like people suddenly are like self</v>
<v Speaker 2>conscious.</v>

836
00:37:20.871 --> 00:37:22.940
<v Speaker 2>They see themselves in a new way and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>

837
00:37:22.970 --> 00:37:24.470
<v Speaker 2>I can't handle this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

838
00:37:24.710 --> 00:37:28.490
<v Speaker 2>That's like 40 years of denial.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Denial.</v>

839
00:37:28.550 --> 00:37:29.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

840
00:37:29.120 --> 00:37:33.050
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all these different mechanisms that</v>

841
00:37:33.051 --> 00:37:36.020
<v Speaker 1>you've kind of like psychological</v>
<v Speaker 1>mechanisms that you've utilized.</v>

842
00:37:36.021 --> 00:37:40.220
<v Speaker 1>Try to hide these thoughts from yourself</v>
<v Speaker 1>or try to skip past them really quickly.</v>

843
00:37:40.250 --> 00:37:41.870
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got that under control and just get</v>

844
00:37:41.871 --> 00:37:44.130
<v Speaker 1>past it and move on to some new thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a,</v>

845
00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:46.340
<v Speaker 1>that's a common thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People love to do it.</v>

846
00:37:47.150 --> 00:37:48.090
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's crazy.</v>

847
00:37:48.580 --> 00:37:49.351
<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel,</v>

848
00:37:49.351 --> 00:37:50.850
<v Speaker 2>I feel like mellow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

849
00:37:50.910 --> 00:37:51.930
<v Speaker 2>it's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like that.</v>

850
00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:53.460
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Still knocked my energy down.</v>

851
00:37:53.461 --> 00:37:57.410
<v Speaker 2>Just a nice nice amount.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Puts you in a condo and I need like a</v>

852
00:37:57.420 --> 00:37:59.630
<v Speaker 2>about 10% energy knockdown,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

853
00:37:59.880 --> 00:38:01.920
<v Speaker 2>Maybe 15% yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a half a hit.</v>

854
00:38:02.310 --> 00:38:03.450
<v Speaker 2>That's what you need.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like just a little,</v>

855
00:38:05.130 --> 00:38:06.240
<v Speaker 2>just where you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

856
00:38:06.900 --> 00:38:07.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fine.</v>

857
00:38:07.980 --> 00:38:09.260
<v Speaker 2>Pause,</v>
<v Speaker 2>beat.</v>

858
00:38:09.670 --> 00:38:12.120
<v Speaker 2>Everything's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fine.</v>

859
00:38:12.180 --> 00:38:15.030
<v Speaker 2>I like that salt lamp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the biggest one I've ever seen.</v>

860
00:38:15.100 --> 00:38:17.880
<v Speaker 2>That's the biggest one would be fine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's um,</v>

861
00:38:18.040 --> 00:38:21.280
<v Speaker 1>it's too big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't look as cool as a small ones</v>

862
00:38:21.281 --> 00:38:24.310
<v Speaker 1>because the small ones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's not as much salt to the light</v>

863
00:38:24.311 --> 00:38:26.890
<v Speaker 1>comes through more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of those things.</v>

864
00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:28.670
<v Speaker 1>It looks cool on paper and then you'd</v>
<v Speaker 1>get it.</v>

865
00:38:29.740 --> 00:38:33.780
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Got The awesome skull there of the long</v>

866
00:38:33.790 --> 00:38:36.250
<v Speaker 2>horn that is an Asian water</v>

867
00:38:36.250 --> 00:38:39.880
<v Speaker 3>buffalo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it friend Adam Green tree shot in</v>

868
00:38:39.881 --> 00:38:41.440
<v Speaker 3>Australia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's really cool.</v>

869
00:38:41.890 --> 00:38:44.140
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He brought it from Australia for me when</v>

870
00:38:44.141 --> 00:38:46.000
<v Speaker 3>he was a guest on the pocket and just</v>
<v Speaker 3>fly that.</v>

871
00:38:46.540 --> 00:38:49.310
<v Speaker 3>He just put it in a carry on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

872
00:38:49.850 --> 00:38:50.640
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

873
00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:53.460
<v Speaker 2>You imagine weight and it wasn't even</v>
<v Speaker 2>boiled down yet.</v>

874
00:38:53.490 --> 00:38:57.240
<v Speaker 2>It was just the head</v>
<v Speaker 2>blood flies.</v>

875
00:38:57.300 --> 00:39:01.580
<v Speaker 2>Exactly like putting an overhead mic</v>
<v Speaker 2>check it.</v>

876
00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:02.650
<v Speaker 2>It'll fit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'll fit.</v>

877
00:39:02.860 --> 00:39:05.110
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you wrapped it up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he must've because he wouldn't want the</v>

878
00:39:05.111 --> 00:39:07.150
<v Speaker 3>bones to crack or break.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Get knocked around,</v>

879
00:39:07.270 --> 00:39:08.510
<v Speaker 3>but he's being wrapped it up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

880
00:39:08.511 --> 00:39:09.910
<v Speaker 3>That's pretty dope.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

881
00:39:09.911 --> 00:39:12.200
<v Speaker 3>He's a wild man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bow Hunter and he,</v>

882
00:39:12.230 --> 00:39:15.370
<v Speaker 3>he goes up to the northern area of</v>
<v Speaker 3>Australia,</v>

883
00:39:15.490 --> 00:39:17.110
<v Speaker 3>Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the animals.</v>

884
00:39:17.111 --> 00:39:19.510
<v Speaker 3>Essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The large mammals are all invasive</v>

885
00:39:19.511 --> 00:39:23.290
<v Speaker 3>species so they have to hunt them cause</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't have predators so he goes up</v>

886
00:39:23.291 --> 00:39:25.660
<v Speaker 3>there and shoots water buffalo and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>bone arrow.</v>

887
00:39:25.930 --> 00:39:30.930
<v Speaker 2>That's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I respect that as opposed to other types</v>

888
00:39:31.691 --> 00:39:35.410
<v Speaker 2>of hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really respect the idea of like mono e</v>

889
00:39:35.411 --> 00:39:36.340
<v Speaker 2>mono,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

890
00:39:36.730 --> 00:39:39.160
<v Speaker 2>Going out there and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what don't you respect?</v>

891
00:39:39.161 --> 00:39:42.770
<v Speaker 2>Like just don't go kill them big.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

892
00:39:42.771 --> 00:39:47.170
<v Speaker 2>Trophy hunting can fuck off entirely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a weird thing.</v>

893
00:39:48.220 --> 00:39:50.200
<v Speaker 2>It's weird that it's almost like</v>

894
00:39:50.580 --> 00:39:55.560
<v Speaker 3>people hunted entirely for food and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>they got enough food and they go,</v>

895
00:39:55.561 --> 00:39:57.320
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to shoot that thing too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

896
00:39:57.330 --> 00:40:00.720
<v Speaker 3>It's like they got into shooting things</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it became a thing of not just</v>

897
00:40:00.721 --> 00:40:02.550
<v Speaker 3>shooting stuff for food but shooting</v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>

898
00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:05.700
<v Speaker 3>Even if you can't justify it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there's some animals,</v>

899
00:40:05.701 --> 00:40:06.534
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

900
00:40:06.570 --> 00:40:09.390
<v Speaker 3>there's certain haunts that they put on</v>
<v Speaker 3>where they kind of have to control</v>

901
00:40:09.391 --> 00:40:11.910
<v Speaker 3>populations of these things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like grizzly bears and stuff like that.</v>

902
00:40:11.911 --> 00:40:16.320
<v Speaker 3>When they started encroaching.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even wolves are certain populations of</v>

903
00:40:16.321 --> 00:40:18.540
<v Speaker 3>wolves they have to control.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then in the northwest,</v>

904
00:40:18.810 --> 00:40:22.410
<v Speaker 3>but you get to like elephants and</v>
<v Speaker 3>tigers,</v>

905
00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:24.600
<v Speaker 3>lions and like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are you doing?</v>

906
00:40:25.340 --> 00:40:27.140
<v Speaker 2>What are they doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are your a man?</v>

907
00:40:27.141 --> 00:40:28.670
<v Speaker 2>Explain that to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is,</v>

908
00:40:28.700 --> 00:40:32.270
<v Speaker 2>what is what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why does that make you feel important</v>

909
00:40:32.510 --> 00:40:35.390
<v Speaker 2>since you had a gun?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean a gun,</v>

910
00:40:35.391 --> 00:40:38.420
<v Speaker 2>you stand back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you sit in the bushes for,</v>

911
00:40:38.421 --> 00:40:40.730
<v Speaker 2>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eight 12 hours and then you pull the</v>

912
00:40:40.731 --> 00:40:41.250
<v Speaker 2>trigger</v>

913
00:40:41.250 --> 00:40:42.720
<v Speaker 3>does,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't even necessarily make them</v>

914
00:40:42.721 --> 00:40:45.240
<v Speaker 3>feel important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just because they can do it.</v>

915
00:40:45.241 --> 00:40:46.410
<v Speaker 3>And this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's exciting.</v>

916
00:40:46.590 --> 00:40:48.750
<v Speaker 3>Like if you were shot a rifle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

917
00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:50.190
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We go to the rifle range.</v>

918
00:40:50.220 --> 00:40:52.740
<v Speaker 3>It's exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fun to just shoot paper,</v>

919
00:40:52.860 --> 00:40:54.600
<v Speaker 3>put paper targets out there and shoot</v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

920
00:40:54.630 --> 00:40:56.010
<v Speaker 3>It's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It feels good.</v>

921
00:40:56.040 --> 00:40:59.490
<v Speaker 3>There's something about like aiming boom</v>
<v Speaker 3>and hitting where you want it to go.</v>

922
00:40:59.880 --> 00:41:00.870
<v Speaker 3>It's exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

923
00:41:01.050 --> 00:41:05.470
<v Speaker 3>And so once that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there was a real problem is in</v>

924
00:41:05.471 --> 00:41:09.990
<v Speaker 3>Africa it becomes incredibly profitable</v>
<v Speaker 3>for the people that live there.</v>

925
00:41:10.170 --> 00:41:13.620
<v Speaker 3>And then those animals are thriving</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they protect them and have</v>

926
00:41:13.621 --> 00:41:15.690
<v Speaker 3>hunters come in and pay shitloads of</v>
<v Speaker 3>money to hunt them.</v>

927
00:41:15.810 --> 00:41:19.000
<v Speaker 3>So their numbers are really healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is really crazy.</v>

928
00:41:19.001 --> 00:41:23.460
<v Speaker 3>It's cause like for the longest time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most of the animals in Africa that are</v>

929
00:41:23.461 --> 00:41:27.420
<v Speaker 3>hunted now in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in plentiful numbers were on the verge</v>

930
00:41:27.421 --> 00:41:28.254
<v Speaker 3>of extinction.</v>

931
00:41:28.510 --> 00:41:29.930
<v Speaker 2>Let me start out of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Still are.</v>

932
00:41:29.931 --> 00:41:32.510
<v Speaker 2>I mean maybe not extinction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think that they have an</v>

933
00:41:32.511 --> 00:41:34.770
<v Speaker 2>abundance the big five over there and</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

934
00:41:34.840 --> 00:41:35.541
<v Speaker 3>depends on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

935
00:41:35.541 --> 00:41:38.880
<v Speaker 3>well it depends on where you are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but Africa obviously it's fucking huge.</v>

936
00:41:38.910 --> 00:41:40.310
<v Speaker 3>Inversely what it looks like when you</v>
<v Speaker 3>took,</v>

937
00:41:40.440 --> 00:41:44.290
<v Speaker 3>but America inside of Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like sits over in the SAR up.</v>

938
00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:48.010
<v Speaker 3>It's like it just sits in this tiny</v>
<v Speaker 3>little bitch ass country.</v>

939
00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:53.920
<v Speaker 3>But in Africa there's many animals that</v>
<v Speaker 3>were 20 years ago on the verge of</v>

940
00:41:54.741 --> 00:41:57.290
<v Speaker 3>extinction that are thriving and it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>because of hunting.</v>

941
00:41:57.380 --> 00:42:00.140
<v Speaker 3>Since some of it makes sense in a tiny</v>
<v Speaker 3>little zone,</v>

942
00:42:00.170 --> 00:42:03.080
<v Speaker 3>I mean they're not driving by.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It drove all numbers.</v>

943
00:42:03.500 --> 00:42:05.630
<v Speaker 3>There's the other problem I have with</v>
<v Speaker 3>people calling the,</v>

944
00:42:05.720 --> 00:42:06.860
<v Speaker 3>a lot of the people that hunt over</v>
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

945
00:42:06.861 --> 00:42:09.120
<v Speaker 3>poachers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they call it like poachers.</v>

946
00:42:09.121 --> 00:42:11.210
<v Speaker 3>The poachers poaching me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's just people who are poor.</v>

947
00:42:11.480 --> 00:42:13.910
<v Speaker 3>That's all it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just like incredibly poor people</v>

948
00:42:13.911 --> 00:42:16.160
<v Speaker 3>that are trapping these animals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And some of them,</v>

949
00:42:16.161 --> 00:42:18.260
<v Speaker 3>like if they're shooting rhinos and</v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff like that,</v>

950
00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:20.390
<v Speaker 3>they're now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not doing it because they're</v>

951
00:42:20.391 --> 00:42:21.890
<v Speaker 3>evil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're doing it because they're fucking</v>

952
00:42:21.891 --> 00:42:23.120
<v Speaker 3>desperate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean they</v>

953
00:42:23.870 --> 00:42:25.250
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is their game.</v>

954
00:42:25.370 --> 00:42:27.920
<v Speaker 2>I mean it belongs to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's their country.</v>

955
00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:30.260
<v Speaker 2>It's their game if you believe people</v>
<v Speaker 2>and animals.</v>

956
00:42:30.290 --> 00:42:31.123
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

957
00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:35.780
<v Speaker 2>but I think as as everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like depending on your perspective,</v>

958
00:42:35.781 --> 00:42:37.820
<v Speaker 2>how much of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like we were talking about when you</v>

959
00:42:37.821 --> 00:42:42.650
<v Speaker 2>get high and suddenly your territory</v>
<v Speaker 2>expanse of what your awarenesses,</v>

960
00:42:42.830 --> 00:42:45.050
<v Speaker 2>same difference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like this is their country,</v>

961
00:42:45.051 --> 00:42:47.690
<v Speaker 2>this is their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are their native population of</v>

962
00:42:47.691 --> 00:42:48.750
<v Speaker 2>animals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's there,</v>

963
00:42:48.950 --> 00:42:53.950
<v Speaker 2>but like taking in a broader scope that</v>
<v Speaker 2>should be utterly protected and</v>

964
00:42:55.071 --> 00:43:00.071
<v Speaker 2>expanding territory rather than like a</v>
<v Speaker 2>little theme park for rich Westerners to</v>

965
00:43:01.401 --> 00:43:02.840
<v Speaker 2>come in and shoot shit.</v>

966
00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:03.873
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's weird.</v>

967
00:43:04.180 --> 00:43:05.920
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever seen a low,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you know Louis Theroux is,</v>

968
00:43:06.730 --> 00:43:11.730
<v Speaker 3>is there a documentarian from the UK?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's got a great special that he did or</v>

969
00:43:12.711 --> 00:43:17.590
<v Speaker 3>we went over to one of those wild game</v>
<v Speaker 3>parks is stay with these Weirdos and</v>

970
00:43:17.740 --> 00:43:19.510
<v Speaker 3>these a rich American people that go</v>
<v Speaker 3>over there,</v>

971
00:43:19.511 --> 00:43:23.050
<v Speaker 3>shoot shit and he was over there for</v>
<v Speaker 3>like weeks and finally just drove the</v>

972
00:43:23.051 --> 00:43:26.350
<v Speaker 3>got crazy until the guy was just like</v>
<v Speaker 3>breaking it down to him.</v>

973
00:43:26.351 --> 00:43:29.080
<v Speaker 3>What's really going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was basically just saying in this</v>

974
00:43:29.081 --> 00:43:31.090
<v Speaker 3>crazy accent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Africa is fucked.</v>

975
00:43:31.120 --> 00:43:33.910
<v Speaker 3>This is what you have to understand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Africa is fucked.</v>

976
00:43:34.180 --> 00:43:37.810
<v Speaker 3>This African guys explain it to him like</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the only way these things are</v>

977
00:43:37.811 --> 00:43:40.060
<v Speaker 3>going to survive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you think that you're going to remove</v>

978
00:43:40.061 --> 00:43:43.030
<v Speaker 3>these fences and remove the profit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

979
00:43:43.360 --> 00:43:46.090
<v Speaker 3>These people gonna come in and slaughter</v>
<v Speaker 3>these things and they're not going to</v>

980
00:43:46.091 --> 00:43:47.500
<v Speaker 3>think at all about the future.</v>

981
00:43:47.620 --> 00:43:50.710
<v Speaker 3>They're not going to think at all about</v>
<v Speaker 3>preserving the populations or them going</v>

982
00:43:50.711 --> 00:43:51.880
<v Speaker 3>extinct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think about it at all.</v>

983
00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:54.700
<v Speaker 3>They're just going to wipe them out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just like they are doing with Rhino</v>

984
00:43:54.700 --> 00:43:57.340
<v Speaker 3>Horn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They know rhinos are worth thousands and</v>

985
00:43:57.340 --> 00:43:59.350
<v Speaker 3>thousands of dollars a horn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they just shoot those fucking things.</v>

986
00:43:59.351 --> 00:44:00.670
<v Speaker 3>They don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't live there.</v>

987
00:44:00.671 --> 00:44:03.250
<v Speaker 3>Their children are starving.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If they find out that they could sell</v>

988
00:44:03.251 --> 00:44:06.310
<v Speaker 3>this Rhino Horn and get x amount $100 or</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>

989
00:44:06.311 --> 00:44:07.930
<v Speaker 3>they give them for it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're just shoot it.</v>

990
00:44:08.170 --> 00:44:10.780
<v Speaker 3>Like that's their concern is not for</v>
<v Speaker 3>rhinos.</v>

991
00:44:10.830 --> 00:44:14.290
<v Speaker 3>They're concern is for their family or</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're an extreme poverty.</v>

992
00:44:14.350 --> 00:44:15.140

<v Speaker 3>because of waterborne diseases.</v>

1016

<v Speaker 3>they're filled with parasites and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>have all these waterborne diseases and</v>

1038
00:46:07.120 --> 00:46:10.060
<v Speaker 3>respected or appreciated and</v>
<v Speaker 3>discriminated against.</v>

00:46:24.771 --> 00:46:27.630
<v Speaker 3>I hang around with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm worried about what I'm gonna eat for</v>

1045
00:46:27.631 --> 00:46:29.550
<v Speaker 3>lunch.</v>

<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking not so shit kills people.</v>

1048
00:46:38.120 --> 00:46:40.580

<v Speaker 2>What's the deal?</v>

1049
00:46:40.750 --> 00:46:44.540
<v Speaker 2>Can totally stop it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem is when you get it,</v>

1050
00:46:44.541 --> 00:46:47.990
<v Speaker 2>once it stays in your system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's gotten it again.</v>

1051
00:46:47.991 --> 00:46:52.220
<v Speaker 2>When he got a cold like herpes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like he got it again when he got a cold.</v>

1052
00:46:52.310 --> 00:46:55.430
<v Speaker 2>Is that true?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Malaria stays in your cells run to him.</v>

1053
00:46:55.580 --> 00:46:57.020
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He got it when he wasn't even over</v>

<v Speaker 2>Nile trip that I want to take my pocket</v>

1064
00:47:20.570 --> 00:47:23.630
<v Speaker 2>It just feels like you'd be having</v>
<v Speaker 2>cocktails up there at sunset,</v>

1065
00:47:23.660 --> 00:47:25.580
<v Speaker 2>walking around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking to all your family and friends</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'd make sure I had like a security boat</v>

1068
00:47:31.961 --> 00:47:32.640
<v Speaker 2>behind me.</v>

1069
00:47:32.640 --> 00:47:35.850
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the kidnappers and shit.</v>

1070

<v Speaker 1>A fucked up place though.</v>

1074
00:47:47.910 --> 00:47:51.600
<v Speaker 1>Crocodiles alone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a friend who went over there.</v>

<v Speaker 1>it goes to these adventures and they</v>

1077
00:47:59.520 --> 00:48:03.180
<v Speaker 1>flew him into this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was the Congo because this</v>

1078
00:48:03.181 --> 00:48:06.060
<v Speaker 1>local village was having a problem with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people.</v>

1079
00:48:06.061 --> 00:48:10.200
<v Speaker 1>They're getting eaten by crocodiles and</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone in the village is like missing</v>

1080
00:48:10.201 --> 00:48:11.560
<v Speaker 1>an arm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll bites,</v>

1081
00:48:11.561 --> 00:48:12.990
<v Speaker 1>taken out of their legs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

1082
00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:15.360
<v Speaker 1>These poor people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they live,</v>

1083
00:48:15.570 --> 00:48:17.070
<v Speaker 1>this is the only place where the water</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

1084
00:48:17.071 --> 00:48:18.720
<v Speaker 1>they have to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're leaving create these little</v>

1085
00:48:18.721 --> 00:48:20.700
<v Speaker 1>fences where they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1086
00:48:20.820 --> 00:48:24.360
<v Speaker 1>they like try to fence in the area so</v>
<v Speaker 1>the crocodiles can't get to that spot.</v>

1087
00:48:24.361 --> 00:48:27.450
<v Speaker 1>They still get in there somehow and fuck</v>
<v Speaker 1>these people up because they've gotten</v>

1088
00:48:27.451 --> 00:48:28.470
<v Speaker 1>accustomed to eating them.</v>

1089
00:48:29.100 --> 00:48:30.620
<v Speaker 1>Oh No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh No.</v>

1090
00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:32.310

<v Speaker 1>Oh No,</v>

1091
00:48:32.650 --> 00:48:32.941
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1092
00:48:32.941 --> 00:48:35.100
<v Speaker 1>Like a waterhole tension.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1093
00:48:35.101 --> 00:48:37.710
<v Speaker 1>animals are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're opportunists.</v>

1094
00:48:37.711 --> 00:48:40.740
<v Speaker 1>And once they decide that your food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's when it becomes a real problem.</v>

1095
00:48:40.770 --> 00:48:43.110
<v Speaker 1>So there's really like man eating</v>
<v Speaker 1>crocodiles.</v>

00:48:43.140 --> 00:48:44.550
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>And this guy is missing.</v>

1100
00:48:50.040 --> 00:48:51.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's in Mozambique.</v>

1101
00:48:51.300 --> 00:48:54.210
<v Speaker 1>This guy's missing and hand disguise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Missing his whole arm.</v>

1102
00:48:54.240 --> 00:48:56.290
<v Speaker 1>The fence will no wonder they that's in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the gym.</v>

1103
00:48:56.310 --> 00:49:00.270
<v Speaker 1>He's a lovely Canadian fellow who</v>
<v Speaker 1>travels everywhere.</v>

1104
00:49:00.330 --> 00:49:01.050
<v Speaker 1>So they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've,</v>

1105
00:49:01.050 --> 00:49:04.590
<v Speaker 1>he's a hunter and they flew him in to</v>
<v Speaker 1>kill these crocodiles for them.</v>

1106
00:49:04.950 --> 00:49:06.330
<v Speaker 1>Nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

1107
00:49:06.331 --> 00:49:07.350
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at that fucking thing.</v>

1108
00:49:07.351 --> 00:49:11.580
<v Speaker 1>You imagine you're living right there</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's just God damn dinosaurs</v>

1109
00:49:11.581 --> 00:49:12.280
<v Speaker 1>everywhere.</v>

1110
00:49:12.280 --> 00:49:13.900
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And furthermore,</v>

1111
00:49:13.930 --> 00:49:15.850
<v Speaker 2>if you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you can get rid of the,</v>

1112
00:49:16.450 --> 00:49:18.340
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it must be a learned behavior because</v>

1113
00:49:18.341 --> 00:49:19.830
<v Speaker 2>most crocodiles aren't doing that.</v>

1114
00:49:20.070 --> 00:49:21.600
<v Speaker 1>It's just that they're near people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll,</v>

1115
00:49:21.630 --> 00:49:23.820
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their brains are so small and there's</v>

1116
00:49:23.821 --> 00:49:26.040
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so reptilian that what?</v>

1117
00:49:26.070 --> 00:49:27.450
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just trying to do is eat.</v>

1118
00:49:27.690 --> 00:49:29.880
<v Speaker 1>And if it's a moving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to try to eat it.</v>

1119
00:49:30.060 --> 00:49:32.280
<v Speaker 1>And if it's a person solid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're targeting people,</v>

1120
00:49:32.310 --> 00:49:35.010
<v Speaker 1>but they found out that they can get</v>
<v Speaker 1>peach row crocodiles.</v>

1121
00:49:35.040 --> 00:49:37.140
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they're just going to eat</v>
<v Speaker 1>any old thing.</v>

1122
00:49:37.200 --> 00:49:39.300
<v Speaker 1>I think they eat everything they can eat</v>
<v Speaker 1>their giant.</v>

1123
00:49:39.960 --> 00:49:42.980
<v Speaker 1>Talking about 1800 pound lizard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's been the same.</v>

1124
00:49:43.010 --> 00:49:46.620
<v Speaker 1>It's exactly the same form for 60 plus</v>
<v Speaker 1>million years.</v>

1125
00:49:48.340 --> 00:49:51.100
<v Speaker 2>You could say the same about sharks and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't just go eat you.</v>

1126
00:49:51.340 --> 00:49:53.780
<v Speaker 2>They would if they could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they just decided to start eating</v>

1127
00:49:53.781 --> 00:49:55.400
<v Speaker 2>with the parks and the people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1128
00:49:56.170 --> 00:49:58.090
<v Speaker 2>People eat get eaten by sharks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1129
00:49:58.091 --> 00:49:59.650
<v Speaker 2>they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't ever,</v>

1130
00:49:59.890 --> 00:50:02.860
<v Speaker 2>no one's ever been eaten by sharks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Generally they're eating like very</v>

1131
00:50:02.861 --> 00:50:05.800
<v Speaker 2>occasionally know Reiki or not eaten by</v>
<v Speaker 2>sharks.</v>

1132
00:50:05.830 --> 00:50:10.450
<v Speaker 2>Generally checks don't have a taste for</v>
<v Speaker 2>our blood is what you're saying.</v>

1133
00:50:10.480 --> 00:50:10.820
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1134
00:50:10.820 --> 00:50:12.460
<v Speaker 2>We're not on the menu.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're not on the menu,</v>

1135
00:50:12.610 --> 00:50:15.640
<v Speaker 2>but they will eat us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They will bite you to get you out of</v>

1136
00:50:15.641 --> 00:50:18.730
<v Speaker 2>their zone or they might mistake you and</v>
<v Speaker 2>bite you.</v>

1137
00:50:18.880 --> 00:50:20.680
<v Speaker 2>They you cause they think you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>something else but they don't.</v>

1138
00:50:20.720 --> 00:50:23.320
<v Speaker 2>You're saying eat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which means like you sit down and you</v>

1139
00:50:23.321 --> 00:50:24.610
<v Speaker 2>finish the meal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1140
00:50:24.760 --> 00:50:27.800
<v Speaker 2>I think that rarely happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Usually they just bite you in half and</v>

1141
00:50:27.801 --> 00:50:29.480
<v Speaker 2>just get a follow up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This tastes like shit.</v>

1142
00:50:29.481 --> 00:50:33.170
<v Speaker 2>Am I gonna find a seal zone?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

1143
00:50:33.171 --> 00:50:35.200
<v Speaker 2>And like I know there's some</v>

1144
00:50:35.330 --> 00:50:38.720
<v Speaker 3>animals that actively target people and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it becomes a giant problem.</v>

1145
00:50:38.721 --> 00:50:41.150
<v Speaker 3>Like in India,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in India there's this river,</v>

1146
00:50:41.210 --> 00:50:43.910
<v Speaker 3>this place called the cinder bands and</v>
<v Speaker 3>the bull sharks.</v>

1147
00:50:44.150 --> 00:50:44.661
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

1148
00:50:44.661 --> 00:50:48.260
<v Speaker 3>These are tigers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It pulls bull sharks are very aggressive</v>

1149
00:50:48.320 --> 00:50:50.390
<v Speaker 3>and they do kill people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but these aren't tiger sharks there.</v>

1150
00:50:50.391 --> 00:50:51.860
<v Speaker 3>Tigers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just the cat.</v>

1151
00:50:52.280 --> 00:50:54.320
<v Speaker 3>They kill a lot of people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1152
00:50:54.380 --> 00:50:55.640
<v Speaker 3>The shit out of you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1153
00:50:56.580 --> 00:50:58.710
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sit down and like put the Napkin in</v>

1154
00:50:58.711 --> 00:51:01.590
<v Speaker 2>their color and get like there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1155
00:51:01.660 --> 00:51:04.360
<v Speaker 3>Well the actively hunt people in this</v>
<v Speaker 3>one place and they've been doing it for</v>

1156
00:51:04.361 --> 00:51:05.330
<v Speaker 3>hundreds of years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've,</v>

1157
00:51:05.380 --> 00:51:09.910
<v Speaker 3>they said over the last 200 years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>300,000 people have been killed by</v>

1158
00:51:09.911 --> 00:51:12.480

1176
00:52:03.290 --> 00:52:05.280
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if a tiger was in a movie as a monster,</v>

1177

<v Speaker 3>but just everyone knows what it is.</v>

1180
00:52:10.420 --> 00:52:13.430

<v Speaker 3>So he's on top of this elephant.</v>

1183
00:52:16.790 --> 00:52:20.990
<v Speaker 3>Now look at the grass and they spot it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the thing,</v>

1184
00:52:20.991 --> 00:52:21.824

00:52:28.730 --> 00:52:31.490
<v Speaker 3>and it's going after him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It knows that he's up there.</v>

1189
00:52:31.491 --> 00:52:32.001
<v Speaker 3>Look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1190
00:52:32.001 --> 00:52:32.834
<v Speaker 3>bitch.</v>

1191
00:52:33.350 --> 00:52:34.550
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I were the elephant,</v>

1192
00:52:34.551 --> 00:52:37.190
<v Speaker 2>I just messed that tiger up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tore the guy's arm apart.</v>

1193
00:52:37.191 --> 00:52:39.350
<v Speaker 2>The elephant didn't really give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just hanging out.</v>

1194
00:52:39.530 --> 00:52:40.610
<v Speaker 2>I looked the elephants like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

1196
00:52:44.220 --> 00:52:45.710

<v Speaker 2>just stomp on it.</v>

1197
00:52:45.770 --> 00:52:48.620
<v Speaker 2>Pretty sure tigers don't kill elephants,</v>

1198
00:52:48.700 --> 00:52:51.070
<v Speaker 3>but lions do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when lions do,</v>

1199
00:52:51.071 --> 00:52:53.800
<v Speaker 3>they're really hungry and they get a</v>
<v Speaker 3>bunch of them and they gang up</v>

1200
00:52:53.870 --> 00:52:54.800
<v Speaker 2>upon an elephant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

00:53:52.080 --> 00:53:52.913
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at that.</v>

1222
00:53:53.120 --> 00:53:55.440
<v Speaker 2>Here we go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thinking about it.</v>

1223

00:54:09.391 --> 00:54:10.530
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

1230
00:54:10.860 --> 00:54:12.870
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And also that he didn't follow up.</v>

1231
00:54:13.500 --> 00:54:16.110
<v Speaker 2>What do you think they were?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was it doing like just fighting it</v>

1232
00:54:16.111 --> 00:54:19.520
<v Speaker 2>or playing with a dog was barking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The kangaroo decided to grab a hold of</v>

1233
00:54:19.530 --> 00:54:22.080
<v Speaker 2>dog and get him in a headlock and that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they do.</v>

1234
00:54:22.190 --> 00:54:26.580
<v Speaker 2>Which is</v>
<v Speaker 2>generally giving you time to react a</v>

1235
00:54:26.581 --> 00:54:29.400
<v Speaker 2>different way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's giving you a moment to not</v>

1236
00:54:29.820 --> 00:54:31.080
<v Speaker 2>escalate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

1237
00:54:31.250 --> 00:54:34.230
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you see the beginning of the video,</v>

1238
00:54:34.231 --> 00:54:36.570
<v Speaker 2>he's running around this kangaroo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he thinks he's hunting.</v>

1239
00:54:36.600 --> 00:54:41.010
<v Speaker 2>He thinks he's like alerting his company</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the car to target.</v>

1240
00:54:41.040 --> 00:54:42.750
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you don't even seem like a real</v>

1241
00:54:42.751 --> 00:54:44.970
<v Speaker 2>animal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they seem like something from an avatar</v>

1242
00:54:44.971 --> 00:54:45.581
<v Speaker 2>movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1243
00:54:45.581 --> 00:54:50.010
<v Speaker 2>You want to cuddle with them all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I see like all I want is to take</v>

1244
00:54:50.011 --> 00:54:54.870
<v Speaker 2>them all home and just cuddle with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Guy Punched him right in the face too</v>

1245
00:54:55.800 --> 00:54:57.390
<v Speaker 2>early.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know that for on their bellies.</v>

1246
00:54:57.391 --> 00:55:01.060
<v Speaker 2>Really like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

1247
00:55:01.240 --> 00:55:02.910
<v Speaker 2>that's a duty I don't see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't see,</v>

1248
00:55:03.930 --> 00:55:06.480
<v Speaker 2>he's not as big as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's a woman.</v>

1249
00:55:06.540 --> 00:55:10.330
<v Speaker 2>It might be because she's not very big.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That also makes sense to that.</v>

1250
00:55:10.331 --> 00:55:12.300
<v Speaker 2>That's what that pouches,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where the tummy,</v>

1251
00:55:12.420 --> 00:55:14.550
<v Speaker 2>what's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a little thing right</v>

1252
00:55:14.551 --> 00:55:16.010
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It says something,</v>

1253
00:55:17.230 --> 00:55:19.900
<v Speaker 2>that little thing hanging down there</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a penis.</v>

1254
00:55:20.250 --> 00:55:21.830
<v Speaker 2>Now the tails back here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1255
00:55:21.840 --> 00:55:26.840
<v Speaker 2>that can't be the penis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Huge Penis.</v>

1256
00:55:28.080 --> 00:55:30.110
<v Speaker 2>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where's the balls bouncing around?</v>

1257
00:55:30.110 --> 00:55:33.030
<v Speaker 2>There it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that's just like the curtain for</v>

1258
00:55:33.040 --> 00:55:35.070
<v Speaker 2>the vast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very developed kangaroo.</v>

1259
00:55:35.071 --> 00:55:38.130
<v Speaker 2>He's not going to win many fights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's sort of a Beta there,</v>

1260
00:55:38.450 --> 00:55:40.170
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's some giant Kangaroos.</v>

1261
00:55:40.350 --> 00:55:42.540
<v Speaker 2>Those big scary one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So get this one knocking on the door.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Hey Man,</v>

1263
00:55:45.230 --> 00:55:48.630
<v Speaker 2>look at the clause and those funds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm saying.</v>

1264
00:55:48.631 --> 00:55:51.360
<v Speaker 2>When you put the dog in the headlock,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he could easily have taken care of that</v>

1265
00:55:51.361 --> 00:55:52.390
<v Speaker 2>dog.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he didn't.</v>

1266
00:55:52.430 --> 00:55:54.870
<v Speaker 2>He like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he kept the head.</v>

1267
00:55:54.871 --> 00:55:56.460
<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm shutting this down.</v>

1268
00:55:56.550 --> 00:55:59.340
<v Speaker 2>I really think we're mis-gendering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we're mis-gendering that</v>

1269
00:55:59.341 --> 00:56:00.780
<v Speaker 2>kangaroo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's a girl.</v>

00:57:33.250 --> 00:57:37.850
<v Speaker 1>51 annual lightning strike fatalities</v>
<v Speaker 1>over the last 20 years on your estimate.</v>

1306

<v Speaker 1>I type thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many golfers die each year from</v>

1310
00:57:48.611 --> 00:57:50.020
<v Speaker 1>lightening,</v>

1313
00:57:56.831 --> 00:58:01.831

1314
00:58:02.560 --> 00:58:04.240
<v Speaker 1>to two and a half.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something like that.</v>

1356
01:00:06.970 --> 01:00:11.970
<v Speaker 2>like utterly devastatingly just shocking</v>
<v Speaker 2>and awful.</v>

<v Speaker 2>friend,</v>

1361
01:00:20.921 --> 01:00:22.540
<v Speaker 2>the hunter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the adrenaline rush.</v>

1362
01:00:22.840 --> 01:00:25.450
<v Speaker 2>I know that's part of why I go there</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it might,</v>

1363
01:00:25.451 --> 01:00:27.450
<v Speaker 2>my sister might be shocked a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1364
01:00:27.670 --> 01:00:29.890
<v Speaker 2>But it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a revolting impulse.</v>

1365
01:00:29.891 --> 01:00:31.900
<v Speaker 2>Like that's the worst of me</v>

1366
01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:34.730
<v Speaker 1>you get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a big tub of ice cream that's</v>

1367
01:00:34.731 --> 01:00:37.840
<v Speaker 1>in your fridge every day and you know</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should need it and you do what?</v>

1368
01:00:37.841 --> 01:00:42.140
<v Speaker 1>You just make your underwear</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're like,</v>

1369
01:00:42.141 --> 01:00:45.860
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is wrong with me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why did I do every time I watch one of</v>

1370
01:00:45.861 --> 01:00:47.300
<v Speaker 1>those videos after it's over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1371
01:00:47.301 --> 01:00:49.730
<v Speaker 1>why the fuck did I watch that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1372
01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:52.580
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that stuff like adds up in</v>
<v Speaker 2>your brain?</v>

1373
01:00:52.581 --> 01:00:55.610
<v Speaker 2>Like how much of our stress and</v>
<v Speaker 2>unhappiness and all that kind of stuff</v>

1374
01:00:55.611 --> 01:00:59.870
<v Speaker 2>that culturally everybody feels is</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you expose yourself to things</v>

1375
01:00:59.871 --> 01:01:01.360
<v Speaker 2>that you just shouldn't know about?</v>

1376
01:01:01.630 --> 01:01:03.880
<v Speaker 1>I think for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for sure it has an effect.</v>

1377
01:01:04.090 --> 01:01:07.060
<v Speaker 1>It's a matter of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does it have an effect as in as far as</v>

1378
01:01:07.061 --> 01:01:11.290
<v Speaker 1>raising awareness of consequences of</v>
<v Speaker 1>devious actions or does it have an</v>

1379
01:01:11.291 --> 01:01:14.620
<v Speaker 1>effect in that you're always worried</v>
<v Speaker 1>about it and so it sort of manifests</v>

1380
01:01:14.621 --> 01:01:17.080
<v Speaker 1>itself more often because it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>constantly in your head.</v>

1381
01:01:17.500 --> 01:01:21.760
<v Speaker 1>The ladder probably makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we needed a cup of coffee,</v>

1382
01:01:21.770 --> 01:01:23.130
<v Speaker 1>a drink and a joint.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1383
01:01:23.170 --> 01:01:27.670
<v Speaker 1>Just to just try to unwind and find a</v>
<v Speaker 1>group of people that you could hang out</v>

1384
01:01:27.671 --> 01:01:31.210
<v Speaker 1>with the trust that are cool to protect</v>
<v Speaker 1>you from all those fuckers coming over</v>

1385
01:01:31.211 --> 01:01:32.920
<v Speaker 1>the fence.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm pissed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you see the thing that there are</v>

1391
01:01:43.631 --> 01:01:47.170
<v Speaker 1>parking submarines over to the power</v>
<v Speaker 1>line over the Internet lines?</v>

1392
01:01:47.500 --> 01:01:48.820
<v Speaker 1>I was wondering about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

1393
01:01:49.990 --> 01:01:52.340
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like probably to let us know he full</v>

1394
01:01:52.341 --> 01:01:56.020
<v Speaker 1>color we could could line with no</v>
<v Speaker 1>problem if that happened.</v>

1395
01:01:56.021 --> 01:01:58.960
<v Speaker 1>How fast do you think it would take</v>
<v Speaker 1>before we got something back up again?</v>

1396
01:01:59.140 --> 01:02:04.140
<v Speaker 1>Or how and how fast crazy that there's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>line that goes across the fucking ocean</v>

1397
01:02:04.751 --> 01:02:05.584
<v Speaker 1>and that's how the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1398
01:02:05.750 --> 01:02:08.600
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are times when I will sit and</v>

1399
01:02:08.601 --> 01:02:11.420
<v Speaker 2>dream about those lines and I'll just</v>
<v Speaker 2>sit there thinking,</v>

1400
01:02:11.750 --> 01:02:16.250
<v Speaker 2>I'll see this sort of greenish merck and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I'll see you hear the silence in</v>

1401
01:02:16.251 --> 01:02:18.920
<v Speaker 2>that clicking sound that you're under,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know with all the fishes eating</v>

1402
01:02:18.930 --> 01:02:19.763
<v Speaker 2>stuff that like</v>

1403
01:02:19.990 --> 01:02:24.450
<v Speaker 1>what do I like clicking stuff and I'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>picture these lonely ass cables just</v>

1404
01:02:24.451 --> 01:02:28.860
<v Speaker 1>draped down the side of a cliff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like in the great abyss and like how</v>

1405
01:02:28.861 --> 01:02:31.190
<v Speaker 1>just picture their loneliness for</v>
<v Speaker 1>awhile.</v>

1406
01:02:31.510 --> 01:02:32.900
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1407

<v Speaker 1>That's intense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

1408
01:02:35.730 --> 01:02:36.670
<v Speaker 1>they're everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1409
01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:39.210
<v Speaker 1>You imagine if aliens came here and saw</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1410
01:02:39.211 --> 01:02:41.610
<v Speaker 1>they'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what in the fuck are these crazy</v>

1411
01:02:41.660 --> 01:02:44.610
<v Speaker 1>assholes wires?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I asked my son what he thinks we're</v>

1412
01:02:44.611 --> 01:02:47.940
<v Speaker 1>going to look back on in the future and</v>
<v Speaker 1>think was like the craziest thing we</v>

1413
01:02:47.941 --> 01:02:51.120
<v Speaker 1>lived with and he said wires and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought it was kind of brilliant.</v>

1414
01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:52.650
<v Speaker 1>That's what a kid would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1415
01:02:52.651 --> 01:02:54.360
<v Speaker 1>That lives the world today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is brilliant</v>

1416
01:02:56.120 --> 01:02:59.700
<v Speaker 1>wires.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could just play live and move anywhere</v>

1417
01:02:59.701 --> 01:03:01.970
<v Speaker 1>around on the stage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have to stand in front of me.</v>

1418
01:03:02.190 --> 01:03:03.870
<v Speaker 1>The fact that we stand in front of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>mic.</v>

1419
01:03:03.871 --> 01:03:06.990
<v Speaker 1>I know there's a great tradition and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really cool and rock and roll,</v>

1420
01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:11.370
<v Speaker 1>but I personally feel very hemmed in by</v>
<v Speaker 1>this Mike,</v>

1421
01:03:11.371 --> 01:03:13.260
<v Speaker 1>Stan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to stand up straight.</v>

1422
01:03:13.261 --> 01:03:15.570
<v Speaker 1>Bobbi Brown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did and I was like,</v>

1423
01:03:15.571 --> 01:03:18.180
<v Speaker 1>all my friends just took me aside and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were like,</v>

1424
01:03:18.181 --> 01:03:22.740
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't do it.</v>

1425
01:03:23.130 --> 01:03:26.550
<v Speaker 1>It works for Anthony Robbins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He does it.</v>

1426
01:03:30.990 --> 01:03:32.220
<v Speaker 1>He does it right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't need go.</v>

1427
01:03:32.221 --> 01:03:36.190
<v Speaker 1>Bobby Brown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whenever it's anybody wears those.</v>

1428
01:03:36.200 --> 01:03:40.770
<v Speaker 1>It's Bobby Brown period.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He did it for my prerogative,</v>

1429
01:03:40.771 --> 01:03:42.960
<v Speaker 1>but that's it for the rest of everyone's</v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

1430
01:03:43.510 --> 01:03:45.260
<v Speaker 1>That's a Bobby Brown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bobby Brown.</v>

1431
01:03:45.330 --> 01:03:49.200
<v Speaker 1>I know a comic who does that really does</v>
<v Speaker 1>is act with,</v>

<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at one point I was like trying in my car</v>

1435

<v Speaker 1>to listen to my positivity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got some very good points.</v>

1436
01:04:05.910 --> 01:04:08.400
<v Speaker 1>He says some things that really can</v>
<v Speaker 1>work,</v>

1437
01:04:08.900 --> 01:04:09.733
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>my whole stage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anywhere I go.</v>

1470
01:05:43.790 --> 01:05:47.030
<v Speaker 2>Don't they have that for sports now they</v>
<v Speaker 2>have this like parabolic microphone</v>

1471
01:05:47.031 --> 01:05:51.430
<v Speaker 2>thing where I think and like zoom in on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the coach talking or zoom in on it got</v>

1472
01:05:51.440 --> 01:05:53.330
<v Speaker 2>this thing where like it's very</v>
<v Speaker 2>directional,</v>

1473
01:05:53.420 --> 01:05:56.000
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like a laser of a microphone so it can</v>

1474
01:05:56.001 --> 01:05:59.690
<v Speaker 2>be up in the ceiling of the arena and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then they just pointed at somebody and</v>

1475
01:05:59.691 --> 01:06:01.490
<v Speaker 2>it can go right in and hear that</v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation.</v>

1476
01:06:02.420 --> 01:06:03.380
<v Speaker 2>A shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1477
01:06:03.770 --> 01:06:04.603
<v Speaker 2>I don't even using it yet.</v>

1478
01:06:04.840 --> 01:06:09.840
<v Speaker 3>Know that they can listen to what you</v>
<v Speaker 3>say in a room by monitoring the window</v>

1479
01:06:12.310 --> 01:06:17.310
<v Speaker 3>and the vibrations of normal human</v>
<v Speaker 3>conversation has enough of an effect on</v>

1480
01:06:18.461 --> 01:06:21.260
<v Speaker 3>the window that they can translate that</v>
<v Speaker 3>in December</v>

1481
01:06:21.350 --> 01:06:22.640
<v Speaker 2>beach.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's insane.</v>

1482
01:06:22.970 --> 01:06:24.320
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's insane.</v>

1483
01:06:24.460 --> 01:06:28.810
<v Speaker 3>They know the noises you're making based</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the effect it has on a window in a</v>

1484
01:06:28.811 --> 01:06:30.310
<v Speaker 3>room.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't even have to be screaming</v>

1485
01:06:30.520 --> 01:06:32.620
<v Speaker 2>just talking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>

1486
01:06:32.621 --> 01:06:34.060
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1487
01:06:34.090 --> 01:06:37.150
<v Speaker 2>that's real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well don't you kind of just assume that</v>

1488
01:06:37.151 --> 01:06:41.860
<v Speaker 2>we're being listened to all the time now</v>
<v Speaker 2>after Edward Snowden and all that stuff</v>

1489
01:06:41.920 --> 01:06:43.650
<v Speaker 2>after you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1490
01:06:43.710 --> 01:06:46.450
<v Speaker 2>the releases of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like I've got at least two fans</v>

1491
01:06:46.451 --> 01:06:51.080
<v Speaker 2>listening in to me at all times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And your house just,</v>

1492
01:06:51.370 --> 01:06:55.540
<v Speaker 2>and like the NSA,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like to Liz Phair but I'm sure there's</v>

1493
01:06:55.541 --> 01:06:56.890
<v Speaker 2>more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1494
01:06:56.891 --> 01:06:58.930
<v Speaker 2>they probably poured like I'm going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>find a terrorist.</v>

1495
01:06:59.320 --> 01:07:02.200
<v Speaker 2>But</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1496
01:07:02.770 --> 01:07:05.440
<v Speaker 2>it's probably a lot of actually thought</v>
<v Speaker 2>about that the other day cause I screwed</v>

1497
01:07:05.441 --> 01:07:08.710
<v Speaker 2>up my knees and I've been doing this</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing where like put my elbows into my</v>

1498
01:07:08.711 --> 01:07:10.690
<v Speaker 2>legs is I'm sitting watching tv or</v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

1499
01:07:10.830 --> 01:07:14.650
<v Speaker 2>Kind of give myself a massage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you were listing through the</v>

1500
01:07:14.651 --> 01:07:17.350
<v Speaker 2>audio of my phone or anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just think I was constantly</v>

1501
01:07:17.351 --> 01:07:20.500
<v Speaker 2>mastered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is kind of like rubbing motion on</v>

1502
01:07:20.510 --> 01:07:23.800
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

1503
01:07:23.830 --> 01:07:25.840
<v Speaker 2>she's never getting off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She keeps stopping.</v>

1504
01:07:25.841 --> 01:07:28.510
<v Speaker 2>What's the</v>
<v Speaker 2>blockage?</v>

1505
01:07:28.600 --> 01:07:32.300
<v Speaker 2>She's frantic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what?</v>

1506
01:07:32.320 --> 01:07:34.740
<v Speaker 2>What are those like the primates that</v>
<v Speaker 2>are constantly,</v>

1507
01:07:35.060 --> 01:07:35.950
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bonobos.</v>

1508
01:07:36.670 --> 01:07:37.503
<v Speaker 2>Vanilla.</v>

1509
01:07:39.030 --> 01:07:41.130
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean we're going to get to a point</v>

1510
01:07:41.131 --> 01:07:43.380
<v Speaker 3>where everybody can listen in on</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody.</v>

1511
01:07:43.440 --> 01:07:45.510
<v Speaker 3>That's what I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we're only a couple of decades</v>

1512
01:07:45.511 --> 01:07:49.080
<v Speaker 3>away from that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think right now it's like content or</v>

1513
01:07:49.081 --> 01:07:49.631
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1514
01:07:49.631 --> 01:07:53.490
<v Speaker 3>a service providers have the possibility</v>
<v Speaker 3>of tapping into you.</v>

1515
01:07:53.550 --> 01:07:57.060
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you know all these different</v>
<v Speaker 3>government groups knows how to tap into</v>

1516
01:07:57.061 --> 01:08:01.350
<v Speaker 3>your phones and tap into your TV and tap</v>
<v Speaker 3>it in the camera that's on your laptop.</v>

1517
01:08:02.040 --> 01:08:03.540
<v Speaker 3>But I think it's going to come a matter</v>
<v Speaker 3>of time.</v>

1518
01:08:03.541 --> 01:08:06.930
<v Speaker 3>But that's the intrusion of privacy is</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to be the bottleneck to future</v>

1519
01:08:06.931 --> 01:08:09.480
<v Speaker 3>technology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we're going to get to some virtual</v>

1520
01:08:09.570 --> 01:08:14.570
<v Speaker 3>reality environment where it is so tight</v>
<v Speaker 3>tonically and so incredibly realistic</v>

1521
01:08:18.080 --> 01:08:21.440
<v Speaker 3>that whatever the fuck happens in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>regular world is going to lose its</v>

1522
01:08:21.441 --> 01:08:24.020
<v Speaker 3>significance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's going to slowly lose significance</v>

1523
01:08:24.230 --> 01:08:26.720
<v Speaker 3>to the point where we're going to accept</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1524
01:08:26.720 --> 01:08:29.930
<v Speaker 3>One of the ways to overcome some of</v>
<v Speaker 3>these technological hurdles as to</v>

1525
01:08:29.931 --> 01:08:34.310
<v Speaker 3>completely dissolve all boundaries</v>
<v Speaker 3>between all people and information.</v>

1526
01:08:34.460 --> 01:08:37.460
<v Speaker 3>Meaning you're going to be able to look</v>
<v Speaker 3>at anybody doing anything anytime and</v>

1527
01:08:37.461 --> 01:08:39.890
<v Speaker 3>they're gonna be able to look at you and</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's going to be the new reality of</v>

1528
01:08:39.891 --> 01:08:42.920
<v Speaker 3>human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this will be after we've accepted</v>

1529
01:08:42.921 --> 01:08:45.770
<v Speaker 3>virtual reality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so once we accept virtual reality,</v>

1530
01:08:46.160 --> 01:08:49.540
<v Speaker 3>regular life is going to be so mundane</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you're going to be able to</v>

1531
01:08:49.541 --> 01:08:52.190
<v Speaker 3>create artificial environments like</v>
<v Speaker 3>Avatar world,</v>

1532
01:08:52.191 --> 01:08:55.070
<v Speaker 3>like you're flying through 2001 a space</v>
<v Speaker 3>odyssey.</v>

1533
01:08:55.310 --> 01:08:57.890
<v Speaker 3>You're hanging out with the champs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to have haptic suits on,</v>

1534
01:08:58.010 --> 01:09:00.680
<v Speaker 3>they give you feedback.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be tied into your central</v>

1535
01:09:00.681 --> 01:09:03.860
<v Speaker 3>nervous system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's going to recreate smells and feels</v>

1536
01:09:03.861 --> 01:09:08.861
<v Speaker 3>and that's all going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not a matter of whether it's going</v>

1537
01:09:08.881 --> 01:09:10.460
<v Speaker 3>to happen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a matter of when is it going to</v>

1538
01:09:10.461 --> 01:09:10.910
<v Speaker 3>happen.</v>

1539
01:09:10.910 --> 01:09:14.330
<v Speaker 3>I think when that does happen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the big bottleneck is going to be</v>

1540
01:09:14.331 --> 01:09:17.330
<v Speaker 3>privacy and I think people are going to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just like they're doing now with</v>

1541
01:09:17.331 --> 01:09:19.670
<v Speaker 3>constantly putting up things on social</v>
<v Speaker 3>media,</v>

1542
01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:23.600
<v Speaker 3>constantly showing pictures of their</v>
<v Speaker 3>kids and constantly giving updates on</v>

1543
01:09:23.601 --> 01:09:26.810
<v Speaker 3>everywhere you go and tagging all these</v>
<v Speaker 3>things at Geo tags.</v>

1544
01:09:26.840 --> 01:09:31.840
<v Speaker 3>I think that in the future we're going</v>
<v Speaker 3>to just accept that no one has any</v>

1545
01:09:31.941 --> 01:09:36.470
<v Speaker 3>privacy and kids today are more likely</v>
<v Speaker 3>to accept it than we were and our kids</v>

1546
01:09:36.471 --> 01:09:39.650
<v Speaker 3>are going to be more likely to accept it</v>
<v Speaker 3>then their kids and it's going to keep</v>

1547
01:09:39.651 --> 01:09:41.990
<v Speaker 3>going on and on and on and three,</v>
<v Speaker 3>four generations.</v>

1548
01:09:41.991 --> 01:09:44.600
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Life is going to be no privacy.</v>

1549
01:09:45.050 --> 01:09:49.220
<v Speaker 3>Like if we were all living in like a big</v>
<v Speaker 3>brother Type House is fucking no</v>

1550
01:09:49.221 --> 01:09:49.971
<v Speaker 3>privacy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1551
01:09:49.971 --> 01:09:52.100
<v Speaker 3>There's cameras everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's people willingly do it.</v>

1552
01:09:52.130 --> 01:09:53.690
<v Speaker 3>How long before everybody willingly does</v>
<v Speaker 3>it?</v>

1553
01:09:54.020 --> 01:09:55.550
<v Speaker 3>It's a matter of time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right now it's a,</v>

1554
01:09:55.551 --> 01:09:59.990
<v Speaker 3>it sounds impossible because we grew up</v>
<v Speaker 3>valuing privacy.</v>

1555
01:09:59.991 --> 01:10:02.690
<v Speaker 3>I need my alone time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want anybody paying attention to</v>

1556
01:10:02.700 --> 01:10:05.120
<v Speaker 3>what I'm doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but once meet human beings are so</v>

1557
01:10:05.121 --> 01:10:10.040
<v Speaker 3>incredibly malleable that once life</v>
<v Speaker 3>changes around us and we know for a fact</v>

1558
01:10:10.041 --> 01:10:12.140
<v Speaker 3>this is an extra ball,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is not going back and lets</v>

1559
01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:14.480
<v Speaker 3>yellowstone blows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We get hit by an asteroid.</v>

1560
01:10:14.630 --> 01:10:16.760
<v Speaker 3>This is life now we're just gonna accept</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

1561
01:10:16.940 --> 01:10:19.760
<v Speaker 3>It's going to go into the next thing and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to deal with people looking</v>

1562
01:10:19.761 --> 01:10:21.440
<v Speaker 3>at you naked all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lol.</v>

1563
01:10:21.530 --> 01:10:23.690
<v Speaker 3>Because you don't care because you're in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Avatar dimension.</v>

1564
01:10:23.691 --> 01:10:27.380
<v Speaker 3>Riding a fucking dragon over a volcano</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you going to be living in a world</v>

1565
01:10:27.381 --> 01:10:30.980
<v Speaker 3>that's so much more fantastic in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>real world that someone looking at your</v>

1566
01:10:30.981 --> 01:10:32.240
<v Speaker 3>asshole and the real world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

1567
01:10:32.241 --> 01:10:33.680
<v Speaker 3>go ahead,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

1568
01:10:34.260 --> 01:10:36.750
<v Speaker 2>who cares.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're basically saying that we're</v>

1569
01:10:36.780 --> 01:10:39.750
<v Speaker 2>putting ourselves in those little pods</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the Matrix.</v>

1570
01:10:39.780 --> 01:10:41.520
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're saying that we're willingly</v>

1571
01:10:41.521 --> 01:10:45.130
<v Speaker 2>climbing in eventually to these little</v>
<v Speaker 2>pods of Google and,</v>

1572
01:10:45.310 --> 01:10:48.840
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and powering the whole machine age.</v>

1573
01:10:48.930 --> 01:10:51.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause we're just going to plug in.</v>

1574
01:10:51.090 --> 01:10:54.000
<v Speaker 2>I think we're going to be symbiotic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we're going to become part</v>

1575
01:10:54.001 --> 01:10:55.560
<v Speaker 2>machine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's inevitable.</v>

1576
01:10:55.760 --> 01:10:57.030
<v Speaker 2>Colony.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1577
01:10:57.550 --> 01:10:59.270
<v Speaker 2>You know where it kind of like an ant</v>
<v Speaker 2>collector.</v>

1578
01:10:59.340 --> 01:11:02.310
<v Speaker 2>One organism with many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many parts.</v>

1579
01:11:02.340 --> 01:11:05.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a matter of time.</v>

1580
01:11:05.520 --> 01:11:06.420
<v Speaker 2>That is that okay.</v>

1581
01:11:06.590 --> 01:11:08.300
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're alive right now.</v>

1582
01:11:08.480 --> 01:11:10.970
<v Speaker 3>You're alive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're alive and a beautiful time.</v>

1583
01:11:11.060 --> 01:11:13.040
<v Speaker 3>You're alive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the transition between when you were</v>

1584
01:11:13.050 --> 01:11:14.070
<v Speaker 3>young and there was no</v>

1585
01:11:14.070 --> 01:11:16.830
<v Speaker 1>internet to now you've been an adult</v>
<v Speaker 1>where there's internet.</v>

1586
01:11:16.860 --> 01:11:19.590
<v Speaker 1>This is the most amazing time ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're lucky.</v>

1587
01:11:19.800 --> 01:11:22.860
<v Speaker 1>We're lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're the most lucky cause we've</v>

1588
01:11:22.861 --> 01:11:25.020
<v Speaker 1>experienced both.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've experienced,</v>

1589
01:11:25.350 --> 01:11:27.870
<v Speaker 1>I mean when I was a kid we didn't have</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking answering machines.</v>

1590
01:11:28.040 --> 01:11:28.671
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

1591
01:11:28.671 --> 01:11:31.700
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just called and hope they were home.</v>

1592
01:11:31.720 --> 01:11:32.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that they weren't home.</v>

1593
01:11:32.841 --> 01:11:33.940
<v Speaker 2>You never found them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

1594
01:11:34.280 --> 01:11:36.590
<v Speaker 2>you open that door to your house,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were a ghost.</v>

1595
01:11:36.620 --> 01:11:38.360
<v Speaker 2>You just guide bid that a trust.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

1596
01:11:38.990 --> 01:11:41.480
<v Speaker 2>you were where you said at work you just</v>
<v Speaker 2>went places,</v>

1597
01:11:41.780 --> 01:11:43.760
<v Speaker 2>you do whatever you want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1598
01:11:43.761 --> 01:11:46.070
<v Speaker 2>and that's the last wild ones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what we are.</v>

1599
01:11:46.180 --> 01:11:49.120
<v Speaker 1>We are the last,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're the last of the disconnected,</v>

1600
01:11:49.720 --> 01:11:52.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were disconnected and then we became</v>

1601
01:11:52.151 --> 01:11:56.350
<v Speaker 1>connected in the 1990s though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a totally new experience for</v>

1602
01:11:56.351 --> 01:11:58.630
<v Speaker 1>human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we experienced both parts.</v>

1603
01:11:58.780 --> 01:12:03.100
<v Speaker 1>We were the last humans to experience no</v>
<v Speaker 1>internet internet.</v>

1604
01:12:04.210 --> 01:12:07.000
<v Speaker 1>No one else will ever experience that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only way they'll experience that is</v>

1605
01:12:07.001 --> 01:12:10.060
<v Speaker 1>if they don't have internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the world has internet.</v>

1606
01:12:10.160 --> 01:12:12.770
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to get back to what you said.</v>

1607
01:12:12.771 --> 01:12:17.270
<v Speaker 2>How long is the electricity down?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If we're attacked on the infrastructure?</v>

1608
01:12:17.450 --> 01:12:20.180
<v Speaker 2>That's what I want to know what we were</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about the internet,</v>

1609
01:12:20.410 --> 01:12:21.640
<v Speaker 2>but some of the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The same thing.</v>

1610
01:12:21.970 --> 01:12:22.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

1611
01:12:22.941 --> 01:12:24.290
<v Speaker 2>that's another,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's an issue too.</v>

1612
01:12:24.320 --> 01:12:24.801
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's all.</v>

1613
01:12:24.801 --> 01:12:29.780
<v Speaker 2>They're going to blow his internet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it would be like the saddest attack.</v>

1614
01:12:31.230 --> 01:12:33.320
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>EMP can take us out to,</v>

1615
01:12:33.321 --> 01:12:36.920
<v Speaker 2>which suggests a scary and probably</v>
<v Speaker 2>easier to accomplish.</v>

1616
01:12:36.950 --> 01:12:40.070
<v Speaker 2>That's what I want to know about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like how long is the recovery time?</v>

1617
01:12:40.071 --> 01:12:40.410
<v Speaker 2>Because</v>

1618
01:12:40.410 --> 01:12:42.540
<v Speaker 1>I do feel like Putin sitting back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>

1619
01:12:42.990 --> 01:12:44.610
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think what they're really worried</v>

1620
01:12:44.611 --> 01:12:49.611
<v Speaker 1>about other than Putin is solar flares.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They think solar fairs have the real</v>

1621
01:12:50.041 --> 01:12:52.560
<v Speaker 1>potential to take out the entire power</v>
<v Speaker 1>grid.</v>

1622
01:12:52.670 --> 01:12:55.400
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's entirely possible and big.</v>

1623
01:12:55.440 --> 01:12:56.100
<v Speaker 1>We know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1624
01:12:56.100 --> 01:12:56.850
<v Speaker 1>that too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1625
01:12:56.850 --> 01:12:57.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

1626
01:12:58.410 --> 01:13:01.770
<v Speaker 1>That's only one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yellowstones the big one.</v>

1627
01:13:02.260 --> 01:13:03.093
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1628
01:13:07.480 --> 01:13:09.490
<v Speaker 2>that was like a stoner moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We all just stopped.</v>

1629
01:13:09.740 --> 01:13:12.410
<v Speaker 1>They know about the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Caldera volcano in yellowstone,</v>

1630
01:13:12.411 --> 01:13:13.244
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1631
01:13:13.730 --> 01:13:15.160
<v Speaker 1>That's the big one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>

1632
01:13:15.330 --> 01:13:16.430
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody should be free.</v>

1633
01:13:16.440 --> 01:13:18.530
<v Speaker 1>I was worried about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although I know what the bulging,</v>

1634
01:13:18.690 --> 01:13:19.730
<v Speaker 1>hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1635
01:13:19.820 --> 01:13:21.780
<v Speaker 1>I think the northwest part is bulging or</v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

1636
01:13:21.800 --> 01:13:24.000
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just constantly have an earthquake.</v>

1637
01:13:24.030 --> 01:13:27.050
<v Speaker 1>They've got thousands of earthquakes</v>
<v Speaker 1>every year for like the last five or six</v>

1638
01:13:27.051 --> 01:13:29.700
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thousands and thousands in a month.</v>

1639
01:13:29.701 --> 01:13:33.320
<v Speaker 1>So Times that to me is not worth</v>
<v Speaker 1>worrying about because there's nothing</v>

1640
01:13:33.321 --> 01:13:37.430
<v Speaker 1>we can do that is like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might as well just the,</v>

1641
01:13:37.431 --> 01:13:39.620
<v Speaker 1>what I said they want it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want to dig a hole.</v>

1642
01:13:39.950 --> 01:13:41.480
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want to drill a hole and let some</v>

1643
01:13:41.481 --> 01:13:42.314
<v Speaker 1>of the gas out.</v>

1644
01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:44.440
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow.</v>

1645
01:13:45.970 --> 01:13:48.370
<v Speaker 2>I applaud their like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1646
01:13:49.690 --> 01:13:52.090
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1647
01:13:52.150 --> 01:13:52.880
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1648
01:13:52.880 --> 01:13:55.360
<v Speaker 1>Didn't want to lance a zit or some of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lava out.</v>

1649
01:13:56.920 --> 01:14:00.340
<v Speaker 1>What's crazy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it that that's happened to human</v>

1650
01:14:00.520 --> 01:14:04.240
<v Speaker 1>civilization like many times over the</v>
<v Speaker 1>course of history at giant volcanoes</v>

1651
01:14:04.241 --> 01:14:05.500
<v Speaker 1>blown up and killed everybody?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1652
01:14:05.830 --> 01:14:07.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A bunch of that shit happened to,</v>

1653
01:14:07.690 --> 01:14:08.523
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1654
01:14:08.740 --> 01:14:10.930
<v Speaker 2>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll be loving life because I'm small.</v>

1655
01:14:11.140 --> 01:14:12.970
<v Speaker 2>I think only the small things survive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1656
01:14:15.460 --> 01:14:16.920
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They said about the,</v>

1657
01:14:16.921 --> 01:14:17.740
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1658
01:14:17.740 --> 01:14:21.580
<v Speaker 1>what hit the Yucatan is that we used to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be like a mole.</v>

1659
01:14:21.850 --> 01:14:25.090
<v Speaker 1>Like human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They di if you trace the evolution of</v>

1660
01:14:25.091 --> 01:14:27.940
<v Speaker 1>the human being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you believe in that nonsense today,</v>

1661
01:14:28.270 --> 01:14:30.790
<v Speaker 1>if you go all the way back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were like a mole.</v>

1662
01:14:31.030 --> 01:14:33.670
<v Speaker 1>We're some kind of a mold that was the</v>
<v Speaker 1>only survivor.</v>

1663
01:14:34.280 --> 01:14:35.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1664
01:14:35.501 --> 01:14:40.501
<v Speaker 1>Literally 65 million years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Human beings are our farthest mammal</v>

1665
01:14:41.051 --> 01:14:45.130
<v Speaker 1>ancestor is some sort of a mole that</v>
<v Speaker 1>survived the big hit.</v>

1666
01:14:45.131 --> 01:14:47.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like shrewish Mulligan thing.</v>

1667
01:14:47.320 --> 01:14:49.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1668
01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:54.360
<v Speaker 2>And cause all the upper predators get</v>
<v Speaker 2>wiped out so then they can thrive and</v>

1669
01:14:54.761 --> 01:14:58.600
<v Speaker 2>they live in a ground so that these</v>
<v Speaker 2>things can live underground and of what</v>

1670
01:14:58.601 --> 01:15:02.320
<v Speaker 2>our future would be like underground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone,</v>

1671
01:15:02.321 --> 01:15:04.420
<v Speaker 2>thanks for joining Mars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think we're just going to go</v>

1672
01:15:04.421 --> 01:15:06.550
<v Speaker 2>underground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are going to go to Mars too though.</v>

1673
01:15:06.551 --> 01:15:08.740
<v Speaker 2>Some idiots support Fox are going to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>no thank you.</v>

1674
01:15:09.070 --> 01:15:12.640
<v Speaker 2>No thank you cass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why do people want to do that?</v>

1675
01:15:13.180 --> 01:15:17.110
<v Speaker 2>Because we can because it's one of those</v>
<v Speaker 2>go sit and like badlands.</v>

1676
01:15:17.140 --> 01:15:18.550
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're done.</v>

1677
01:15:19.260 --> 01:15:20.800
<v Speaker 2>And you can come back and have pie.</v>

1678
01:15:20.970 --> 01:15:22.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's dumb.</v>

1679
01:15:22.680 --> 01:15:24.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you have to bring water or have</v>

1680
01:15:24.361 --> 01:15:26.390
<v Speaker 1>to go get it and melt it down with,</v>

1681
01:15:26.590 --> 01:15:27.610
<v Speaker 2>but you're there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1682
01:15:27.611 --> 01:15:30.190
<v Speaker 2>You're on Mars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's just say we're on Mars.</v>

1683
01:15:30.340 --> 01:15:32.550
<v Speaker 2>What do we do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're just terrify me.</v>

1684
01:15:33.020 --> 01:15:34.900
<v Speaker 2>Cry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stop working.</v>

1685
01:15:35.260 --> 01:15:36.093
<v Speaker 2>Rock.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1686
01:15:36.250 --> 01:15:39.610
<v Speaker 2>Do I mean I just don't see the life</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

1687
01:15:40.230 --> 01:15:42.990
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think people want to be pioneers and I</v>

1688
01:15:42.991 --> 01:15:46.320
<v Speaker 1>think it's entirely possible that you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to wind up going with some really</v>

1689
01:15:46.321 --> 01:15:47.300
<v Speaker 1>crazy people too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1690
01:15:47.460 --> 01:15:48.160
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1691
01:15:48.160 --> 01:15:50.400
<v Speaker 1>He wants to be a pioneer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That isolated.</v>

1692
01:15:50.520 --> 01:15:52.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Crazy pants.</v>

1693
01:15:52.021 --> 01:15:55.920
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>See if I know a lady who lives in the</v>

1694
01:15:55.920 --> 01:15:57.270
<v Speaker 1>Arctic Circle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She lives like two more hundred miles</v>

1695
01:15:57.271 --> 01:15:59.910
<v Speaker 1>above the arctic circle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's on that shield life below zero.</v>

1696
01:15:59.940 --> 01:16:02.790
<v Speaker 1>You ever see that show?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But she can come out when she wants.</v>

1697
01:16:02.910 --> 01:16:04.380
<v Speaker 1>She can come back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She flies back.</v>

1698
01:16:04.440 --> 01:16:05.490
<v Speaker 1>She ain't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was in the studio,</v>

1699
01:16:05.491 --> 01:16:06.330
<v Speaker 1>not this one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the old one,</v>

1700
01:16:06.510 --> 01:16:08.820
<v Speaker 1>but she was sitting right where you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>sitting like,</v>

1701
01:16:08.880 --> 01:16:11.700
<v Speaker 1>you know she's a normal person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't even take a cruise.</v>

1702
01:16:12.180 --> 01:16:13.290
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1703
01:16:13.560 --> 01:16:14.820
<v Speaker 1>but you're going to cruise in the Congo.</v>

1704
01:16:15.760 --> 01:16:20.590
<v Speaker 2>That's a river,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I can't take a cruise boat because I</v>

1705
01:16:20.591 --> 01:16:23.890
<v Speaker 2>can't be isolated in the middle of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>ocean with people I don't think are</v>

1706
01:16:23.891 --> 01:16:25.750
<v Speaker 2>really on the ball.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I can't do it.</v>

1707
01:16:26.200 --> 01:16:30.460
<v Speaker 2>I think that's where like the next</v>
<v Speaker 2>plague starts I think does happen</v>

1708
01:16:30.461 --> 01:16:31.330
<v Speaker 2>sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1709
01:16:31.331 --> 01:16:34.420
<v Speaker 2>they get the norovirus or whatever on a</v>
<v Speaker 2>cruise ship.</v>

1710
01:16:34.660 --> 01:16:36.140
<v Speaker 2>I want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if someone was just really in a chuck</v>

1711
01:16:36.141 --> 01:16:39.220
<v Speaker 2>and people over the side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that's your move.</v>

1712
01:16:39.280 --> 01:16:41.980
<v Speaker 2>You just take a crew of people that</v>
<v Speaker 2>survive that.</v>

1713
01:16:42.070 --> 01:16:47.050
<v Speaker 2>I like the stories of the people that</v>
<v Speaker 2>fall off the cruise ship and they get</v>

1714
01:16:47.051 --> 01:16:49.240
<v Speaker 2>bound.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who the fuck finds him there in a</v>

1715
01:16:49.241 --> 01:16:50.800
<v Speaker 2>shipping lane?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They get found.</v>

1716
01:16:50.860 --> 01:16:52.570
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've loved those stories.</v>

1717
01:16:52.630 --> 01:16:55.270
<v Speaker 2>I've never heard those doors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always thought your fuck you imagine,</v>

1718
01:16:55.320 --> 01:16:57.910
<v Speaker 2>could you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's almost nothing that can fuck you</v>

1719
01:16:57.911 --> 01:17:00.880
<v Speaker 2>worse than to fall off a cruise ship.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But these people,</v>

1720
01:17:00.881 --> 01:17:02.050
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they survive it.</v>

1721
01:17:02.350 --> 01:17:04.210
<v Speaker 2>You have to think of how long can you</v>
<v Speaker 2>swim,</v>

1722
01:17:04.510 --> 01:17:07.540
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's like 13 hours or I dunno,</v>

1723
01:17:07.570 --> 01:17:08.920
<v Speaker 2>how long can you tread water?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1724
01:17:08.921 --> 01:17:11.420
<v Speaker 2>you can tread water longer than that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh no,</v>

1725
01:17:11.510 --> 01:17:12.343
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can.</v>

1726
01:17:12.500 --> 01:17:14.720
<v Speaker 2>I sink like a rock.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'll be hallucinating.</v>

1727
01:17:15.230 --> 01:17:16.640
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you still be treading water.</v>

1728
01:17:17.510 --> 01:17:18.980
<v Speaker 3>You just be your tissue</v>

1729
01:17:19.130 --> 01:17:21.920
<v Speaker 2>tearing apart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I heard one guy talk about was how</v>

1730
01:17:21.921 --> 01:17:25.610
<v Speaker 2>he saw,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like he had the illusion of seeing boats</v>

1731
01:17:25.611 --> 01:17:30.611
<v Speaker 2>come by and talk to him and he like</v>
<v Speaker 2>talked to people that were saying just</v>

1732
01:17:30.621 --> 01:17:32.240
<v Speaker 2>hang on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hang on longer.</v>

1733
01:17:32.390 --> 01:17:34.580
<v Speaker 2>It was all imaginary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like none of it was real.</v>

1734
01:17:34.581 --> 01:17:39.170
<v Speaker 2>But he was having like a full sort of</v>
<v Speaker 2>trippy virtual reality experience with</v>

1735
01:17:39.171 --> 01:17:41.480
<v Speaker 2>his hallucinations that kept him alive</v>
<v Speaker 2>longer.</v>

1736
01:17:41.481 --> 01:17:45.980
<v Speaker 2>They were like his subconscious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they would come in his mind in</v>

1737
01:17:45.981 --> 01:17:49.550
<v Speaker 2>vessels and like stop and talk to him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>throw him something.</v>

1738
01:17:49.660 --> 01:17:51.170
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Motivate him.</v>

1739
01:17:51.350 --> 01:17:53.300
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess you could get that if you go</v>

1740
01:17:53.301 --> 01:17:54.270
<v Speaker 2>into one of those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1741
01:17:55.010 --> 01:17:57.220
<v Speaker 2>sensory deprivation tanks or something</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1742
01:17:57.590 --> 01:17:58.280
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you do?</v>

1743
01:17:58.280 --> 01:17:59.720
<v Speaker 2>I want to run over here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shut up.</v>

1744
01:17:59.750 --> 01:18:01.760
<v Speaker 2>Fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>

1745
01:18:02.120 --> 01:18:03.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1746
01:18:03.890 --> 01:18:05.110
<v Speaker 2>do you do that regularly?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1747
01:18:05.420 --> 01:18:07.160
<v Speaker 2>Do you have a loose nations?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1748
01:18:07.430 --> 01:18:08.330
<v Speaker 2>definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tell me.</v>

1749
01:18:08.860 --> 01:18:09.693
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1750
01:18:09.830 --> 01:18:14.660
<v Speaker 3>the most extreme one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was in a jungle and um,</v>

1751
01:18:14.710 --> 01:18:18.670
<v Speaker 3>there was some people that were native</v>
<v Speaker 3>to this place.</v>

1752
01:18:18.700 --> 01:18:21.330
<v Speaker 3>They were dressed in western clothes</v>
<v Speaker 3>though,</v>

1753
01:18:21.340 --> 01:18:24.100
<v Speaker 3>like t shirts and shorts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they were barefoot,</v>

1754
01:18:24.190 --> 01:18:27.940
<v Speaker 3>which is often the case though</v>
<v Speaker 3>unfortunately a lot of people that live</v>

1755
01:18:27.941 --> 01:18:32.020
<v Speaker 3>in these indigenous villages,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were like under armour shirts and</v>

1756
01:18:32.021 --> 01:18:34.810
<v Speaker 3>shit that they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone gets them somehow it gets down</v>

1757
01:18:34.811 --> 01:18:37.030
<v Speaker 3>to them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Missionaries maybe sometimes bring them.</v>

1758
01:18:37.760 --> 01:18:39.580
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they were speaking in a language</v>

1759
01:18:39.610 --> 01:18:42.910
<v Speaker 3>that I understood,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was an English and I don't speak</v>

1760
01:18:42.911 --> 01:18:44.950
<v Speaker 3>anything other than English.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when they were talking,</v>

1761
01:18:45.040 --> 01:18:47.890
<v Speaker 3>I was listening to them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was amongst them and I was listening</v>

1762
01:18:47.891 --> 01:18:51.040
<v Speaker 3>to them and they were speaking of is</v>
<v Speaker 3>very different language.</v>

1763
01:18:51.340 --> 01:18:54.280
<v Speaker 3>And then I realized like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit,</v>

1764
01:18:54.610 --> 01:18:57.580
<v Speaker 3>I can understand their language,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I realized that in English.</v>

1765
01:18:57.580 --> 01:18:59.060
<v Speaker 3>And then Poof,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I popped out of the,</v>

1766
01:18:59.310 --> 01:19:02.620
<v Speaker 3>the spell like my freaking out about it</v>
<v Speaker 3>brought me,</v>

1767
01:19:02.740 --> 01:19:03.470
<v Speaker 3>it was all like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't know.</v>

1768
01:19:03.470 --> 01:19:04.300
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't go away.</v>

1769
01:19:04.300 --> 01:19:05.920
<v Speaker 3>Don't go away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ah,</v>

1770
01:19:06.040 --> 01:19:07.540
<v Speaker 3>fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1771
01:19:07.570 --> 01:19:10.530
<v Speaker 3>it was so extreme.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was so I could smell the,</v>

1772
01:19:10.730 --> 01:19:13.870
<v Speaker 3>the rain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could feel the moisture in the air.</v>

1773
01:19:13.871 --> 01:19:18.040
<v Speaker 3>I could see the leaves all around me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could hear the sounds of the forest</v>

1774
01:19:18.670 --> 01:19:21.640
<v Speaker 3>and these people in the rain forest just</v>
<v Speaker 3>hanging out talking to this.</v>

1775
01:19:22.060 --> 01:19:24.250
<v Speaker 3>It was totally uneventful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nothing was happening.</v>

1776
01:19:24.400 --> 01:19:27.580
<v Speaker 3>But they were talking in this language</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I absolutely knew what they were</v>

1777
01:19:27.581 --> 01:19:29.290
<v Speaker 3>saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were going back and forth and</v>

1778
01:19:29.291 --> 01:19:32.800
<v Speaker 3>communicating and I was following the</v>
<v Speaker 3>conversation in their language,</v>

1779
01:19:32.801 --> 01:19:35.410
<v Speaker 3>thinking in their language and then I</v>
<v Speaker 3>realized it and I woke up.</v>

1780
01:19:37.630 --> 01:19:38.463
<v Speaker 2>How do you interpret,</v>

1781
01:19:39.330 --> 01:19:42.840
<v Speaker 3>I think first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was tripping balls,</v>

1782
01:19:43.020 --> 01:19:43.920
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's that,</v>

1783
01:19:43.980 --> 01:19:47.220
<v Speaker 3>there's been in that tank on what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1784
01:19:48.240 --> 01:19:49.800
<v Speaker 3>I think it was edible pot.</v>

1785
01:19:51.240 --> 01:19:52.770
<v Speaker 3>I've done a bunch of different things in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the tank,</v>

1786
01:19:52.771 --> 01:19:57.771
<v Speaker 3>but mostly it's edible pot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pot Edibles has a distinctly</v>

1787
01:19:58.290 --> 01:20:03.290
<v Speaker 3>hallucinatory effect at high doses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially when you close your eyes and</v>

1788
01:20:03.301 --> 01:20:04.560
<v Speaker 3>you're laying back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And just like,</v>

1789
01:20:04.561 --> 01:20:07.680
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just letting visuals place.</v>

1790
01:20:08.480 --> 01:20:10.950
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>also I think it's entirely possible that</v>

1791
01:20:10.951 --> 01:20:15.951
<v Speaker 3>we have genetic memory and I think it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>entirely possible that like there's</v>

1792
01:20:16.821 --> 01:20:20.190
<v Speaker 3>certain things that people pass down to</v>
<v Speaker 3>their children.</v>

1793
01:20:20.400 --> 01:20:23.730
<v Speaker 3>Like there are certain traits that my</v>
<v Speaker 3>kids have that are watching them.</v>

1794
01:20:24.030 --> 01:20:24.863
<v Speaker 3>And I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1795
01:20:24.990 --> 01:20:26.910
<v Speaker 3>how do you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why are you so into this?</v>

1796
01:20:26.940 --> 01:20:30.120
<v Speaker 3>Are you so into this because you just</v>
<v Speaker 3>happen to be into this?</v>

1797
01:20:30.121 --> 01:20:33.270
<v Speaker 3>Are you into this because you cause I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>into this and somehow or another gotten</v>

1798
01:20:33.271 --> 01:20:37.740
<v Speaker 3>in my jeans and passed on to your little</v>
<v Speaker 3>tiny body and now you're developing with</v>

1799
01:20:37.741 --> 01:20:40.470
<v Speaker 3>this like hunger for certain certain</v>
<v Speaker 3>types of activities.</v>

1800
01:20:40.680 --> 01:20:44.540
<v Speaker 3>Because I see it literally</v>
<v Speaker 3>will little note,</v>

1801
01:20:44.550 --> 01:20:49.250
<v Speaker 3>we don't know what's transferred.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't know how much of like what</v>

1802
01:20:49.251 --> 01:20:50.910
<v Speaker 3>links people have certain instincts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1803
01:20:50.970 --> 01:20:52.650
<v Speaker 3>People are afraid of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>spiders are afraid of snakes.</v>

1804
01:20:52.651 --> 01:20:53.850
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why is that?</v>

1805
01:20:54.060 --> 01:20:58.260
<v Speaker 3>It's probably some memory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Probably somewhere along the line some</v>

1806
01:20:58.261 --> 01:21:02.280
<v Speaker 3>memory got transferred into your DNA.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well the question is like how much gets</v>

1807
01:21:02.281 --> 01:21:05.220
<v Speaker 3>in there until I hope my nine year old</v>
<v Speaker 3>daughter,</v>

1808
01:21:06.180 --> 01:21:08.460
<v Speaker 3>I thought probably very little.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was probably,</v>

1809
01:21:08.461 --> 01:21:10.260
<v Speaker 3>it's just like physical traits and</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's it.</v>

1810
01:21:10.410 --> 01:21:14.000
<v Speaker 3>But her mind is so much like my mind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1811
01:21:14.001 --> 01:21:15.840
<v Speaker 3>and especially her obsession with</v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

1812
01:21:15.841 --> 01:21:19.500
<v Speaker 3>I've never seen a little kid so obsessed</v>
<v Speaker 3>with things like this is me in a nine</v>

1813
01:21:19.501 --> 01:21:21.810
<v Speaker 3>year old girl's body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like this is fucking crazy.</v>

1814
01:21:22.410 --> 01:21:27.410
<v Speaker 3>And talking to people that have musical</v>
<v Speaker 3>talent or people that have artistic</v>

1815
01:21:29.281 --> 01:21:32.160
<v Speaker 3>talent and their children seem to have</v>
<v Speaker 3>an aptitude for this,</v>

1816
01:21:32.161 --> 01:21:36.600
<v Speaker 3>like an an unusual attitude almost as if</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're trying to remember it rather</v>

1817
01:21:36.601 --> 01:21:37.434
<v Speaker 3>than learn it.</v>

1818
01:21:37.860 --> 01:21:39.690
<v Speaker 3>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like what you just said.</v>

1819
01:21:39.691 --> 01:21:43.140
<v Speaker 3>I like that area.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's something that gets</v>

1820
01:21:43.141 --> 01:21:43.890
<v Speaker 3>trend.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

1821
01:21:43.890 --> 01:21:46.380
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how much of it is readable</v>
<v Speaker 3>data,</v>

1822
01:21:46.560 --> 01:21:49.920
<v Speaker 3>but I think there's so much information</v>
<v Speaker 3>that gets through yourselves and then I</v>

1823
01:21:49.921 --> 01:21:52.920
<v Speaker 3>think the child is faced with their own</v>
<v Speaker 3>data,</v>

1824
01:21:52.921 --> 01:21:54.390
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Their own life experiences,</v>

1825
01:21:54.391 --> 01:21:57.840
<v Speaker 3>their own genetics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're on hormones and all these</v>

1826
01:21:57.841 --> 01:21:59.310
<v Speaker 3>different things that are happening</v>
<v Speaker 3>around them.</v>

1827
01:21:59.610 --> 01:22:03.780
<v Speaker 3>But I think underneath all of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's entirely possible.</v>

1828
01:22:03.781 --> 01:22:06.600
<v Speaker 3>There remains some very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very distant memories,</v>

1829
01:22:06.720 --> 01:22:11.070
<v Speaker 3>which is why people survived as long as</v>
<v Speaker 3>they did because you could transfer some</v>

1830
01:22:11.071 --> 01:22:14.700
<v Speaker 3>knowledge until the kids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's probably less today than</v>

1831
01:22:14.701 --> 01:22:17.880
<v Speaker 3>before because the world's so safe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything's nerved.</v>

1832
01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:19.530
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to worry about getting</v>
<v Speaker 3>eaten by leopards.</v>

1833
01:22:19.531 --> 01:22:21.180
<v Speaker 3>Like it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a totally different environment.</v>

1834
01:22:21.181 --> 01:22:22.890
<v Speaker 3>We live in it so less of it gets in</v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

1835
01:22:23.070 --> 01:22:26.790
<v Speaker 3>But I think there's probably still</v>
<v Speaker 3>somewhere in the operating system.</v>

1836
01:22:26.791 --> 01:22:28.890
<v Speaker 3>If you went into dos and started</v>
<v Speaker 3>sneaking around,</v>

1837
01:22:29.070 --> 01:22:32.400
<v Speaker 3>you'd find some weird code from like</v>
<v Speaker 3>different languages that you spoke</v>

1838
01:22:32.550 --> 01:22:36.770
<v Speaker 3>10,000 years ago or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who knows whatever life experience.</v>

1839
01:22:36.771 --> 01:22:40.140
<v Speaker 3>Like why are kids scared of monsters?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those are another thing that they were</v>

1840
01:22:40.141 --> 01:22:41.430
<v Speaker 3>talking about once in one of these</v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

1841
01:22:41.640 --> 01:22:45.360
<v Speaker 3>Like they're scared of monsters because</v>
<v Speaker 3>monsters used to be a real thing that</v>

1842
01:22:45.361 --> 01:22:48.210
<v Speaker 3>you had to worry about it cause they ate</v>
<v Speaker 3>people like cats,</v>

1843
01:22:48.240 --> 01:22:51.420
<v Speaker 3>like leopards and jaguars and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that was a real problem.</v>

1844
01:22:51.540 --> 01:22:54.690
<v Speaker 3>So little kids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not scared of bullets or you</v>

1845
01:22:54.691 --> 01:22:57.120
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're scared of fucking monsters.</v>

1846
01:22:57.150 --> 01:22:58.890
<v Speaker 3>That's what every little kid scared of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the dark.</v>

1847
01:22:58.891 --> 01:23:01.560
<v Speaker 3>And monsters because that's in our</v>
<v Speaker 3>genetic memory.</v>

1848
01:23:01.561 --> 01:23:06.220
<v Speaker 3>Probably some leftover shit for when we</v>
<v Speaker 3>got eaten a lot in trees.</v>

1849
01:23:06.820 --> 01:23:07.653
<v Speaker 2>Trees.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1850
01:23:08.320 --> 01:23:11.770
<v Speaker 2>So falling and pronation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1851
01:23:11.771 --> 01:23:14.680
<v Speaker 2>both.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So is that what you think happened?</v>

1852
01:23:14.750 --> 01:23:18.430
<v Speaker 2>Like that you kind of access to memory</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I was going more with like the</v>

1853
01:23:18.460 --> 01:23:19.660
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you call it?</v>

1854
01:23:19.661 --> 01:23:23.080
<v Speaker 2>Collective unconscious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you were seeing a present day thing</v>

1855
01:23:23.081 --> 01:23:25.990
<v Speaker 2>in another part of the war all I doubt</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1856
01:23:26.110 --> 01:23:27.770
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going back in your,</v>

1857
01:23:27.890 --> 01:23:29.630
<v Speaker 3>I think it was his imagination more than</v>
<v Speaker 3>anything,</v>

1858
01:23:29.631 --> 01:23:32.390
<v Speaker 3>honestly find to be really honest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was imagination.</v>

1859
01:23:33.230 --> 01:23:35.960
<v Speaker 3>I think I just have a very vivid</v>
<v Speaker 3>imagination and it's particularly when I</v>

1860
01:23:35.961 --> 01:23:38.550
<v Speaker 3>was lit on some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1861
01:23:39.530 --> 01:23:41.600
<v Speaker 2>I've read a study where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1862
01:23:42.590 --> 01:23:44.990
<v Speaker 2>if something really traumatic happens to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the parents,</v>

1863
01:23:45.020 --> 01:23:46.730
<v Speaker 2>and I don't know if this is animals or</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

1864
01:23:47.450 --> 01:23:51.860
<v Speaker 2>even if the baby animal is born after</v>
<v Speaker 2>this thing is over,</v>

1865
01:23:51.861 --> 01:23:56.861
<v Speaker 2>this traumatic event,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll have a fear of that thing is</v>

1866
01:23:57.450 --> 01:24:00.890
<v Speaker 2>that was very poorly articulated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the pots like gone through me.</v>

1867
01:24:00.920 --> 01:24:01.461
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1868
01:24:01.461 --> 01:24:02.930
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just like sort of,</v>

1869
01:24:03.030 --> 01:24:04.260
<v Speaker 3>I think I know what you're talking</v>
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>

1870
01:24:04.290 --> 01:24:07.800
<v Speaker 3>There was a study that they did with</v>
<v Speaker 3>mice and what they do with mice as they</v>

1871
01:24:07.801 --> 01:24:11.580
<v Speaker 3>sprayed a citrus and aroma inside the</v>
<v Speaker 3>cage.</v>

1872
01:24:11.730 --> 01:24:13.470
<v Speaker 3>And then the electrocuted the feed of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the mice,</v>

1873
01:24:14.010 --> 01:24:18.300
<v Speaker 3>their children when they smelled this is</v>
<v Speaker 3>children that had not had been</v>

1874
01:24:18.301 --> 01:24:20.310
<v Speaker 3>electrocuted when they smelled that</v>
<v Speaker 3>citrus aroma,</v>

1875
01:24:20.460 --> 01:24:22.230
<v Speaker 3>they had a heightened panic state.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1876
01:24:22.410 --> 01:24:23.490
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what it is.</v>

1877
01:24:23.640 --> 01:24:23.910
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1878
01:24:23.910 --> 01:24:25.650
<v Speaker 2>But that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that how they figured that out?</v>

1879
01:24:25.651 --> 01:24:29.430
<v Speaker 2>Because that seems like I can explain</v>
<v Speaker 2>that with normal science.</v>

1880
01:24:29.940 --> 01:24:31.380
<v Speaker 2>That's easy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1881
01:24:32.310 --> 01:24:34.470
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause they'll have the sense,</v>

1882
01:24:35.780 --> 01:24:37.050
<v Speaker 2>well no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>never.</v>

1883
01:24:37.270 --> 01:24:40.570
<v Speaker 3>They never experienced the electrocution</v>
<v Speaker 3>thank before on the smell.</v>

1884
01:24:40.660 --> 01:24:42.160
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the smell never gave them a</v>

1885
01:24:42.161 --> 01:24:46.090
<v Speaker 3>heightened sense of awareness in mice</v>
<v Speaker 3>that weren't fetus would be shocked.</v>

1886
01:24:46.150 --> 01:24:47.470
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're saying they weren't pregnant?</v>

1887
01:24:47.680 --> 01:24:48.131
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1888
01:24:48.131 --> 01:24:48.881
<v Speaker 3>they weren't pregnant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1889
01:24:48.881 --> 01:24:50.950
<v Speaker 3>this is before their pregnancy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if not even there.</v>

1890
01:24:51.010 --> 01:24:52.000
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

1891
01:24:52.390 --> 01:24:54.760
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what explains that genetic memory?</v>

1892
01:24:55.330 --> 01:24:57.670
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a piece of evidence appointed</v>

1893
01:24:57.700 --> 01:24:59.440
<v Speaker 3>genetic memory,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's one of those things.</v>

1894
01:24:59.441 --> 01:25:04.120
<v Speaker 3>It's like if you don't understand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go back to dos are c plus or something</v>

1895
01:25:04.121 --> 01:25:05.020
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some computer code.</v>

1896
01:25:05.021 --> 01:25:06.310
<v Speaker 3>I don't understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I read it,</v>

1897
01:25:06.311 --> 01:25:09.460
<v Speaker 3>it's just jibberish to me or like those</v>
<v Speaker 3>quantum physics guys and write all that</v>

1898
01:25:09.461 --> 01:25:12.810
<v Speaker 3>stuff does just gibberish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we might be just getting that gerrish</v>

1899
01:25:12.820 --> 01:25:14.530
<v Speaker 3>going and what is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's going on here?</v>

1900
01:25:14.680 --> 01:25:15.550
<v Speaker 3>No one knows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1901
01:25:15.551 --> 01:25:17.800
<v Speaker 3>We don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One day maybe we'll be able to read that</v>

1902
01:25:17.801 --> 01:25:21.340
<v Speaker 3>jibberish but right now we know there's</v>
<v Speaker 3>something getting passed down from these</v>

1903
01:25:21.341 --> 01:25:24.670
<v Speaker 3>mice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so if the parent gets shocked because</v>

1904
01:25:24.671 --> 01:25:27.610
<v Speaker 3>they smell that thing and then the kids</v>
<v Speaker 3>who have nothing to do with it,</v>

1905
01:25:27.880 --> 01:25:31.270
<v Speaker 3>they get shocked or they a smell it and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they think they're going to get shocked.</v>

1906
01:25:31.360 --> 01:25:32.710
<v Speaker 3>Something's being transferred to that.</v>

1907
01:25:32.960 --> 01:25:35.710
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That means that we have components of</v>

1908
01:25:35.711 --> 01:25:39.490
<v Speaker 2>our parents.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like right now we're reacting to stuff</v>

1909
01:25:39.670 --> 01:25:41.140
<v Speaker 2>in our everyday life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Our fears,</v>

1910
01:25:41.141 --> 01:25:42.460
<v Speaker 2>our worries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our neuroses.</v>

1911
01:25:42.510 --> 01:25:45.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Possibly things that our parents</v>

1912
01:25:45.221 --> 01:25:46.054
<v Speaker 2>experienced.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1913
01:25:46.230 --> 01:25:50.010
<v Speaker 3>It's entirely possible that you didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>neuroses of your parents is somehow or</v>

1914
01:25:50.011 --> 01:25:53.220
<v Speaker 3>another transferred into your body,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether or not you accept them as your</v>

1915
01:25:53.221 --> 01:25:54.054
<v Speaker 3>own.</v>

1916
01:25:54.240 --> 01:25:57.390
<v Speaker 2>Because I'm adopted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That means I have two sets of neuroses</v>

1917
01:25:57.420 --> 01:26:00.530
<v Speaker 2>going at once and wonder and one</v>
<v Speaker 2>doubling down on,</v>

1918
01:26:00.760 --> 01:26:04.370
<v Speaker 3>I wonder how much your adoptive parents</v>
<v Speaker 3>gave you sticks.</v>

1919
01:26:04.760 --> 01:26:06.330
<v Speaker 1>What does this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who does?</v>

1920
01:26:06.400 --> 01:26:07.840
<v Speaker 1>Another study's authors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wa,</v>

1921
01:26:07.900 --> 01:26:10.760
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was an early researcher of trauma,</v>

1922
01:26:10.820 --> 01:26:14.210
<v Speaker 1>trauma and heritability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Her research on Holocaust survivors</v>

1923
01:26:14.211 --> 01:26:17.360
<v Speaker 1>found that epigenetic changes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not the genes themselves,</v>

1924
01:26:17.480 --> 01:26:21.050
<v Speaker 1>but how they are turned on and off by</v>
<v Speaker 1>other molecules could be passed down to</v>

1925
01:26:21.051 --> 01:26:23.030
<v Speaker 1>survivors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>children and change their stress</v>

1926
01:26:23.031 --> 01:26:24.290
<v Speaker 1>hormones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1927
01:26:25.260 --> 01:26:26.130
<v Speaker 2>There's a bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what does that,</v>

1928
01:26:26.220 --> 01:26:29.490
<v Speaker 2>how does that express itself though?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not genes themselves,</v>

1929
01:26:29.940 --> 01:26:33.360
<v Speaker 2>but how they are turned on and off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but by other molecules could be passed</v>

1930
01:26:33.361 --> 01:26:35.130
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they're going to be heightened,</v>

1931
01:26:35.190 --> 01:26:38.160
<v Speaker 2>they're going to have a heightened</v>
<v Speaker 2>sensitivity to threat.</v>

1932
01:26:38.550 --> 01:26:41.850
<v Speaker 2>Probably.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably they're going to have like a</v>

1933
01:26:41.851 --> 01:26:43.800
<v Speaker 2>quicker response neurologically.</v>

1934
01:26:43.980 --> 01:26:45.140
<v Speaker 1>Will they say that about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1935
01:26:45.270 --> 01:26:49.230
<v Speaker 1>children that are in the womb when their</v>
<v Speaker 1>mother is under extreme stress or</v>

1936
01:26:49.231 --> 01:26:51.330
<v Speaker 1>violence?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can sense that.</v>

1937
01:26:51.331 --> 01:26:52.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

1938
01:26:52.130 --> 01:26:52.963
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1939
01:26:53.050 --> 01:26:57.040
<v Speaker 2>But what freaks me out is that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not even like a fetal baby that's</v>

1940
01:26:57.041 --> 01:26:57.890
<v Speaker 2>reacting this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1941
01:26:57.940 --> 01:27:00.970
<v Speaker 2>Like complete genetic material</v>
<v Speaker 2>transference.</v>

1942
01:27:01.050 --> 01:27:03.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who knows?</v>

1943
01:27:04.080 --> 01:27:06.420
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we know enough future</v>
<v Speaker 1>science.</v>

1944
01:27:06.510 --> 01:27:07.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what you're into.</v>

1945
01:27:08.130 --> 01:27:10.950
<v Speaker 2>I'm weighing the future science.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wish we lived in the future.</v>

1946
01:27:11.280 --> 01:27:13.470
<v Speaker 2>So that's where ghosts fit in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just go,</v>

1947
01:27:13.471 --> 01:27:14.460
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>future science,</v>

1948
01:27:14.461 --> 01:27:17.300
<v Speaker 2>I think I just think time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think time is a,</v>

1949
01:27:17.760 --> 01:27:20.970
<v Speaker 2>an illusion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that I'm more,</v>

1950
01:27:21.480 --> 01:27:23.370
<v Speaker 2>did you ever see interstellar?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1951
01:27:23.700 --> 01:27:25.500
<v Speaker 2>I'm more in that zone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>

1952
01:27:26.710 --> 01:27:29.730
<v Speaker 2>That's that smacked of good science to</v>
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

1953
01:27:30.010 --> 01:27:31.470
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

1954
01:27:32.030 --> 01:27:36.500
<v Speaker 1>So when you say time's an illusion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you mean like the watch is real?</v>

1955
01:27:36.550 --> 01:27:38.750
<v Speaker 1>Like if it says four 30 that's when the</v>
<v Speaker 1>movie starts,</v>

1956
01:27:38.870 --> 01:27:40.010
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all real.</v>

1957
01:27:40.740 --> 01:27:42.150
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's just coordination.</v>

1958
01:27:42.960 --> 01:27:45.300
<v Speaker 2>That's it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's within our species.</v>

1959
01:27:45.301 --> 01:27:48.360
<v Speaker 2>We're coordinating together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're working as an ant colony.</v>

1960
01:27:48.390 --> 01:27:51.210
<v Speaker 2>We're sending signals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which happened to be time signals.</v>

1961
01:27:51.211 --> 01:27:53.370
<v Speaker 2>We're using math to coordinate,</v>

1962
01:27:53.440 --> 01:27:56.080
<v Speaker 1>but if you go underwater and hold your</v>
<v Speaker 1>breath for five minutes,</v>

1963
01:27:56.230 --> 01:27:58.330
<v Speaker 1>that's real five minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1964
01:27:58.331 --> 01:28:01.600
<v Speaker 1>that's just when you run out of oxygen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that five minutes,</v>

1965
01:28:01.601 --> 01:28:05.770
<v Speaker 1>that is the counting of that time</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't mean anything.</v>

1966
01:28:05.771 --> 01:28:07.240
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't mean anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1967
01:28:07.270 --> 01:28:09.460
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't mean anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if someone's five minutes late,</v>

1968
01:28:09.461 --> 01:28:09.911
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bitch,</v>

1969
01:28:09.911 --> 01:28:10.840
<v Speaker 1>you're five minutes late.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1970
01:28:12.770 --> 01:28:15.420
<v Speaker 2>Well I'm never mad about that because</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm always late,</v>

1971
01:28:15.421 --> 01:28:16.254
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

1972
01:28:17.180 --> 01:28:18.013
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

1973
01:28:18.030 --> 01:28:19.550
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>

1974
01:28:19.970 --> 01:28:23.180
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well the only time supposedly is now and</v>

1975
01:28:23.181 --> 01:28:26.720
<v Speaker 1>everything else is just are pathetic</v>
<v Speaker 1>attempts at measuring it and trying to,</v>

1976
01:28:27.130 --> 01:28:29.350
<v Speaker 2>that's just coordination on like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1977
01:28:29.380 --> 01:28:32.900
<v Speaker 2>people like that's all we're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like how old are you?</v>

1978
01:28:32.901 --> 01:28:33.611
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1979
01:28:33.611 --> 01:28:37.480
<v Speaker 2>and then that just means how crispy you</v>
<v Speaker 2>are from going around the sun.</v>

1980
01:28:38.260 --> 01:28:40.470
<v Speaker 2>That's not like really anything</v>
<v Speaker 2>accessory.</v>

1981
01:28:40.960 --> 01:28:41.793
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>

1982
01:28:41.920 --> 01:28:43.270
<v Speaker 2>sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

1983
01:28:43.660 --> 01:28:44.291
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Skin.</v>

1984
01:28:44.291 --> 01:28:48.040
<v Speaker 2>Cracklin you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it's just kind of that and to me</v>

1985
01:28:48.041 --> 01:28:48.910
<v Speaker 2>like time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>

1986
01:28:48.911 --> 01:28:51.460
<v Speaker 2>it's just space.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like how far are you away from this</v>

1987
01:28:51.461 --> 01:28:54.220
<v Speaker 2>gravitational pull?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think gravity is way more interesting.</v>

1988
01:28:54.760 --> 01:28:57.820
<v Speaker 2>I think time is just us coordinating</v>
<v Speaker 2>with math.</v>

1989
01:28:59.020 --> 01:29:00.040
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we definitely are,</v>

1990
01:29:00.041 --> 01:29:01.950
<v Speaker 1>but it's also like when Sun's coming up,</v>

1991
01:29:02.010 --> 01:29:05.010
<v Speaker 3>like check your watch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>six 15 sun's coming up.</v>

1992
01:29:05.040 --> 01:29:05.873
<v Speaker 3>That's a real thing.</v>

1993
01:29:06.020 --> 01:29:08.280
<v Speaker 2>We're just clocking a spin of an earth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1994
01:29:08.290 --> 01:29:10.040
<v Speaker 2>It's the same thing with the lungs under</v>
<v Speaker 2>water.</v>

1995
01:29:10.370 --> 01:29:12.390
<v Speaker 2>The earth spins.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree with you.</v>

1996
01:29:12.391 --> 01:29:12.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1997
01:29:12.500 --> 01:29:13.960
<v Speaker 3>Disagree with you at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1998
01:29:14.260 --> 01:29:16.300
<v Speaker 3>that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you're right.</v>

1999
01:29:16.330 --> 01:29:19.450
<v Speaker 3>But I also think the fucking movie</v>
<v Speaker 3>starts at four 30.</v>

2000
01:29:20.550 --> 01:29:22.980
<v Speaker 2>That's another human putting on a movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's true.</v>

2001
01:29:23.010 --> 01:29:27.240
<v Speaker 2>You're just coordinating with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>give me an example of time that is a</v>

2002
01:29:27.241 --> 01:29:31.200
<v Speaker 2>manifest thing outside of human</v>
<v Speaker 2>coordination.</v>

2003
01:29:31.760 --> 01:29:32.600
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2004
01:29:32.630 --> 01:29:34.230
<v Speaker 3>you could the oldest,</v>

2005
01:29:34.530 --> 01:29:37.460
<v Speaker 2>I don't mean like things happening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2006
01:29:37.520 --> 01:29:39.570
<v Speaker 2>I mean time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just time itself.</v>

2007
01:29:39.780 --> 01:29:42.750
<v Speaker 2>Is that helpful in any way?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Other than for us?</v>

2008
01:29:42.780 --> 01:29:45.060
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it exists in the universe</v>
<v Speaker 2>really.</v>

2009
01:29:45.420 --> 01:29:48.180
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if the universe had a big bang and that</v>

2010
01:29:48.181 --> 01:29:49.220
<v Speaker 3>was a point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't</v>

2011
01:29:50.140 --> 01:29:52.690
<v Speaker 2>living room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>

2012
01:29:53.470 --> 01:29:56.440
<v Speaker 2>What do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we're looking at,</v>

2013
01:29:57.340 --> 01:29:58.480
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Black holes.</v>

2014
01:29:59.800 --> 01:30:01.300
<v Speaker 2>Say there's a train,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2015
01:30:01.301 --> 01:30:03.310
<v Speaker 2>We're at a where to depot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2016
01:30:03.370 --> 01:30:04.660
<v Speaker 2>I love that word.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Train depot.</v>

2017
01:30:04.661 --> 01:30:07.660
<v Speaker 2>Depot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like home depot or a train depot.</v>

2018
01:30:07.690 --> 01:30:11.500
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's like a giant but of a train.</v>

2019
01:30:11.620 --> 01:30:12.850
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Huge.</v>

2020
01:30:12.940 --> 01:30:14.530
<v Speaker 2>I Dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 2>20 feet tall,</v>

2021
01:30:15.400 --> 01:30:18.610
<v Speaker 2>18 feet wide,</v>
<v Speaker 2>filled with that legs.</v>

2022
01:30:18.650 --> 01:30:21.370
<v Speaker 2>That shame,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that feeling of like,</v>

2023
01:30:21.371 --> 01:30:24.220
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's great mechanical power and then</v>

2024
01:30:24.221 --> 01:30:26.200
<v Speaker 2>it leaves the depo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're still there.</v>

2025
01:30:26.380 --> 01:30:27.660
<v Speaker 2>You didn't get on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2026
01:30:27.760 --> 01:30:30.160
<v Speaker 2>And it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just travels in the distance into a</v>

2027
01:30:30.161 --> 01:30:31.750
<v Speaker 2>Tinier and Tinier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tinier,</v>

2028
01:30:31.751 --> 01:30:34.900
<v Speaker 2>tinier speck until it's just a little</v>
<v Speaker 2>point until you can't see it anymore.</v>

2029
01:30:35.740 --> 01:30:38.290
<v Speaker 2>Did the train shrink?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

2030
01:30:38.680 --> 01:30:42.130
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you see all this matter going</v>

2031
01:30:42.131 --> 01:30:46.720
<v Speaker 2>into a black hole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it really hitting a singularity or we</v>

2032
01:30:46.721 --> 01:30:51.550
<v Speaker 2>really condensing matter to that extent?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or is it just condensing to a certain</v>

2033
01:30:51.551 --> 01:30:55.690
<v Speaker 2>extent and traveling in the distance?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it going somewhere?</v>

2034
01:30:55.840 --> 01:31:00.840
<v Speaker 2>And that's why we perceive it as gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's basically to run this by an</v>

2035
01:31:01.150 --> 01:31:03.760
<v Speaker 2>astrophysicist and then they break out</v>
<v Speaker 2>the worm hall.</v>

2036
01:31:03.761 --> 01:31:05.920
<v Speaker 2>But that's not the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not what I'm saying.</v>

2037
01:31:06.010 --> 01:31:09.070
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think the big bangs or the other</v>

2038
01:31:09.071 --> 01:31:10.780
<v Speaker 2>end of that process,</v>

2039
01:31:12.140 --> 01:31:13.960
<v Speaker 3>the under end of the process of coming</v>
<v Speaker 3>out,</v>

2040
01:31:14.320 --> 01:31:15.700
<v Speaker 3>that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a real,</v>

2041
01:31:15.760 --> 01:31:16.600
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thought.</v>

2042
01:31:16.720 --> 01:31:18.100
<v Speaker 3>They think that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2043
01:31:18.640 --> 01:31:23.410
<v Speaker 3>every galaxy has a super massive black</v>
<v Speaker 3>hole black hole that's in the center of</v>

2044
01:31:23.411 --> 01:31:25.600
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One half of 1% of the mass,</v>

2045
01:31:25.610 --> 01:31:27.880
<v Speaker 3>the entire galaxy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the larger the galaxy,</v>

2046
01:31:27.881 --> 01:31:32.620
<v Speaker 3>the largest supermassive black hole,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the prevailing theory is that,</v>

2047
01:31:32.710 --> 01:31:37.000
<v Speaker 3>or one of the prevailing theories I</v>
<v Speaker 3>should say inside every black hole may</v>

2048
01:31:37.001 --> 01:31:40.840
<v Speaker 3>be another universe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's entirely possible that there's</v>

2049
01:31:40.841 --> 01:31:44.830
<v Speaker 3>another universe of hundreds of billions</v>
<v Speaker 3>of galaxies each with supermassive black</v>

2050
01:31:44.831 --> 01:31:47.440
<v Speaker 3>holes in the center of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he'd go through that one you go</v>

2051
01:31:47.441 --> 01:31:49.420
<v Speaker 3>into,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's fractal and it just goes on forever</v>

2052
01:31:49.421 --> 01:31:50.680
<v Speaker 3>and ever and ever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's entirely,</v>

2053
01:31:50.970 --> 01:31:53.280
<v Speaker 2>that's my philosophy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think the whole Universe is</v>

2054
01:31:53.281 --> 01:31:55.410
<v Speaker 2>spinning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the whole thing's a spiral deal.</v>

2055
01:31:55.440 --> 01:31:57.830
<v Speaker 2>Mm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they think that don't tell them</v>

2056
01:31:57.840 --> 01:32:00.430
<v Speaker 2>within the spiral,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get the eddies right,</v>

2057
01:32:00.431 --> 01:32:03.700
<v Speaker 2>which of the galaxies and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>irregularities and stuff,</v>

2058
01:32:03.701 --> 01:32:05.740
<v Speaker 2>but the whole Shebang is also spinning</v>

2059
01:32:06.030 --> 01:32:09.060
<v Speaker 3>the multiverse ideas like legit</v>
<v Speaker 3>scientists.</v>

2060
01:32:09.061 --> 01:32:10.250
<v Speaker 3>Talk about that now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That that,</v>

2061
01:32:10.251 --> 01:32:12.960
<v Speaker 3>that there might be different for that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Number two universes.</v>

2062
01:32:13.140 --> 01:32:15.570
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I agree with that and there's so much</v>

2063
01:32:15.571 --> 01:32:18.060
<v Speaker 3>more sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What makes some kind of like the people</v>

2064
01:32:18.061 --> 01:32:19.680
<v Speaker 3>that go out of that's crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the universe,</v>

2065
01:32:19.681 --> 01:32:21.210
<v Speaker 3>it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>

2066
01:32:21.240 --> 01:32:23.790
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy that you look out and you see</v>
<v Speaker 3>forever.</v>

2067
01:32:24.130 --> 01:32:26.550
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's really fucking crazy.</v>

2068
01:32:26.551 --> 01:32:27.384
<v Speaker 3>And when you look up</v>

2069
01:32:27.570 --> 01:32:29.910
<v Speaker 2>hanging out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're sitting on the side of a planet,</v>

2070
01:32:30.070 --> 01:32:31.510
<v Speaker 3>you're in the middle of the whole thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2071
01:32:31.511 --> 01:32:32.940
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're in the middle of this soup of,</v>

2072
01:32:32.941 --> 01:32:35.620
<v Speaker 3>of reality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But to think that that's crazy,</v>

2073
01:32:35.621 --> 01:32:37.570
<v Speaker 3>but that's as crazy as it gets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like says who,</v>

2074
01:32:37.960 --> 01:32:39.790
<v Speaker 3>why would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why would you think this fucking the</v>

2075
01:32:39.791 --> 01:32:43.000
<v Speaker 3>infinite numbers of these things out</v>
<v Speaker 3>there that were just a part of something</v>

2076
01:32:43.001 --> 01:32:46.390
<v Speaker 3>that's so big you like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you looked at all of the Zeros on</v>

2077
01:32:46.391 --> 01:32:48.220
<v Speaker 3>that number,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you wouldn't even be able to wrap your</v>

2078
01:32:48.221 --> 01:32:49.120
<v Speaker 3>head around it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'd be like,</v>

2079
01:32:49.121 --> 01:32:50.680
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's a billion?</v>

2080
01:32:50.710 --> 01:32:53.410
<v Speaker 3>How many zeroes is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How many billions is this?</v>

2081
01:32:53.560 --> 01:32:55.410
<v Speaker 3>How many trillions isn't a billion?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

2082
01:32:55.411 --> 01:32:58.350
<v Speaker 3>but there's no way that they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's too much.</v>

2083
01:32:58.480 --> 01:33:02.320
<v Speaker 2>There's this enigma thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love it so much and it's talking about</v>

2084
01:33:02.350 --> 01:33:04.270
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has to do with why we haven't seen</v>

2085
01:33:04.271 --> 01:33:05.200
<v Speaker 2>aliens yet.</v>

2086
01:33:05.970 --> 01:33:07.610
<v Speaker 3>The fermi paradox.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2087
01:33:07.700 --> 01:33:08.610
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's it.</v>

2088
01:33:08.640 --> 01:33:10.890
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The fermi paradox is like questioning</v>

2089
01:33:10.891 --> 01:33:13.500
<v Speaker 3>why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because there's so many different life.</v>

2090
01:33:13.501 --> 01:33:14.790
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some different plants it could</v>

2091
01:33:14.791 --> 01:33:19.791
<v Speaker 3>potentially support life is like if</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's 100 billion galaxies or hundreds</v>

2092
01:33:20.490 --> 01:33:22.950
<v Speaker 3>of billion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>each one has a hundreds of billions of</v>

2093
01:33:22.951 --> 01:33:25.440
<v Speaker 3>stars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How many of those have habitable planets</v>

2094
01:33:25.650 --> 01:33:26.910
<v Speaker 3>and if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if so,</v>

2095
01:33:27.240 --> 01:33:28.710
<v Speaker 3>why haven't they contact?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2096
01:33:28.790 --> 01:33:29.623
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2097
01:33:29.760 --> 01:33:34.760
<v Speaker 2>and like the math is overwhelming that</v>
<v Speaker 2>either we're the first or they kill all</v>

2098
01:33:35.371 --> 01:33:36.420
<v Speaker 2>the comers.</v>

2099
01:33:36.600 --> 01:33:39.430
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or or there we're like,</v>

2100
01:33:40.420 --> 01:33:43.780
<v Speaker 3>or we turn inward</v>
<v Speaker 3>and go into the,</v>

2101
01:33:45.440 --> 01:33:49.690
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's the turn inward turning toward is</v>

2102
01:33:49.691 --> 01:33:52.330
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea that we all go virtual and then</v>

2103
01:33:52.331 --> 01:33:56.350
<v Speaker 3>we become some sort of a symbiotic thing</v>
<v Speaker 3>connected to this,</v>

2104
01:33:56.830 --> 01:34:00.610
<v Speaker 3>this hive mind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this real electronic reality.</v>

2105
01:34:00.810 --> 01:34:04.020
<v Speaker 2>I can't handle self driving cars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't do that.</v>

2106
01:34:04.090 --> 01:34:05.220
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't.</v>

2107
01:34:05.280 --> 01:34:06.113
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not.</v>

2108
01:34:06.210 --> 01:34:06.871
<v Speaker 2>Am I?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

2109
01:34:06.871 --> 01:34:07.704
<v Speaker 2>I am.</v>

2110
01:34:09.050 --> 01:34:11.180
<v Speaker 3>How could you dot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Self driving?</v>

2111
01:34:11.181 --> 01:34:13.760
<v Speaker 3>Cars are real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're here and they suck right now.</v>

2112
01:34:14.360 --> 01:34:15.470
<v Speaker 3>They're killed a couple of people.</v>

2113
01:34:15.900 --> 01:34:18.450
<v Speaker 2>That's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's like five of them on the road</v>

2114
01:34:18.451 --> 01:34:21.150
<v Speaker 2>and they've already killed someone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of them on the road.</v>

2115
01:34:21.960 --> 01:34:22.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2116
01:34:22.590 --> 01:34:26.430
<v Speaker 2>I feel extremely unsafe about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I reject that with every fiber of my</v>

2117
01:34:26.431 --> 01:34:28.950
<v Speaker 2>being.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I drive my own car.</v>

2118
01:34:29.520 --> 01:34:32.310
<v Speaker 3>Good for you kind of car.</v>

<v Speaker 3>do you rich check on their partying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hardy.</v>

2120
01:34:38.130 --> 01:34:39.870
<v Speaker 3>We're getting deep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going deep.</v>

2121
01:34:41.070 --> 01:34:43.170
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they'll get it down.</v>

2122
01:34:43.560 --> 01:34:46.500
<v Speaker 3>They'll get the autonomous car down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The real problem is going to be the</v>

2123
01:34:46.501 --> 01:34:49.770
<v Speaker 3>thrill and the excitement of freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just getting in your car,</v>

2124
01:34:49.771 --> 01:34:51.900
<v Speaker 3>turn the key and just going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm good dude.</v>

2125
01:34:52.320 --> 01:34:53.610
<v Speaker 3>You can't do that anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's gonna.</v>

2126
01:34:53.640 --> 01:34:55.740
<v Speaker 3>That's gonna be a real thing that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to be one day.</v>

2127
01:34:55.980 --> 01:34:58.160
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean not feels</v>

2128
01:34:58.160 --> 01:35:03.160
<v Speaker 2>extremely threatening as an American.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like America to me is about big,</v>

2129
01:35:03.231 --> 01:35:06.360
<v Speaker 2>long roads and freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2130
01:35:06.980 --> 01:35:09.320
<v Speaker 2>Go where I want when I want kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

2131
01:35:09.490 --> 01:35:11.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you've got the goods,</v>

2132
01:35:11.241 --> 01:35:13.340
<v Speaker 2>you can start a business there or</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is.</v>

2133
01:35:13.370 --> 01:35:15.110
<v Speaker 2>That to me is America is the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2134
01:35:15.350 --> 01:35:17.120
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to be locked into little</v>
<v Speaker 2>channels,</v>

2135
01:35:17.121 --> 01:35:19.220
<v Speaker 2>going all 20 miles an hour,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2136
01:35:19.221 --> 01:35:21.410
<v Speaker 2>like I need,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you want to be able to accelerate?</v>

2137
01:35:21.950 --> 01:35:25.490
<v Speaker 2>I consider driving kind of an art form.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of an art thing.</v>

2138
01:35:26.420 --> 01:35:29.810
<v Speaker 2>It's like a sport.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You be an activity and I don't want to</v>

2139
01:35:29.811 --> 01:35:33.300
<v Speaker 2>relinquish that to be like a thing on a</v>
<v Speaker 2>factory line.</v>

2140
01:35:33.370 --> 01:35:36.130
<v Speaker 3>Well you might get lucky and die before</v>
<v Speaker 3>it becomes mandatory.</v>

2141
01:35:36.930 --> 01:35:38.040
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not at all.</v>

2142
01:35:38.730 --> 01:35:39.070
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2143
01:35:39.070 --> 01:35:39.271
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2144
01:35:39.271 --> 01:35:41.010
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't dovetail nicely with my</v>

2145
01:35:41.011 --> 01:35:43.740
<v Speaker 2>idea that they're going to discover</v>
<v Speaker 2>something that lets me live 500 years</v>

2146
01:35:43.741 --> 01:35:46.310
<v Speaker 2>cause I've decided that's exact perfect</v>
<v Speaker 2>life span for me.</v>

2147
01:35:46.770 --> 01:35:48.540
<v Speaker 2>For me personally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not for everyone.</v>

2148
01:35:49.690 --> 01:35:52.690
<v Speaker 3>Would you think that you'll still be</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting after it when you like 450 years</v>

2149
01:35:52.691 --> 01:35:53.350
<v Speaker 3>old?</v>

2150
01:35:53.350 --> 01:35:55.450
<v Speaker 2>They'll have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll have hormones for that.</v>

2151
01:35:55.480 --> 01:35:58.240
<v Speaker 2>They'll have everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just we'll have everything for that.</v>

2152
01:35:58.270 --> 01:36:00.790
<v Speaker 2>Have you juiced up large physical</v>
<v Speaker 2>envelope will be okay.</v>

2153
01:36:00.791 --> 01:36:03.100
<v Speaker 2>It's the psychology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you not go mad?</v>

2154
01:36:03.370 --> 01:36:06.580
<v Speaker 2>You might go mad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well it depends on if everyone else is</v>

2155
01:36:06.581 --> 01:36:07.980
<v Speaker 2>living 500 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even then</v>

2156
01:36:08.810 --> 01:36:13.810
<v Speaker 3>before we were talking about if you</v>
<v Speaker 3>found out that you were going to live</v>

2157
01:36:14.931 --> 01:36:18.110
<v Speaker 3>this life over again every time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like infinitely.</v>

2158
01:36:18.470 --> 01:36:19.880
<v Speaker 3>What'd you be able to handle it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2159
01:36:20.600 --> 01:36:23.120
<v Speaker 3>but why you handle it now?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You live in right now?</v>

2160
01:36:24.020 --> 01:36:26.310
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would you be conscious that this was</v>

2161
01:36:26.311 --> 01:36:29.130
<v Speaker 2>your fifth two and half the time we take</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone's word for it back to the</v>

2162
01:36:29.131 --> 01:36:31.290
<v Speaker 2>Matrix,</v>
<v Speaker 2>neo is come back like five times.</v>

2163
01:36:31.291 --> 01:36:32.790
<v Speaker 2>He still can't get it right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2164
01:36:33.320 --> 01:36:35.600
<v Speaker 3>But if someone came up to you right now</v>
<v Speaker 3>and said,</v>

2165
01:36:36.230 --> 01:36:38.420
<v Speaker 3>Liz,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to give you the reality of</v>

2166
01:36:38.421 --> 01:36:40.580
<v Speaker 3>existence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the reality of existences.</v>

2167
01:36:40.610 --> 01:36:44.660
<v Speaker 3>You will do this life an infinite number</v>
<v Speaker 3>of times until you get it right and</v>

2168
01:36:44.661 --> 01:36:46.820
<v Speaker 3>you're never going to get it right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you just going to keep living this</v>

2169
01:36:46.821 --> 01:36:50.720
<v Speaker 3>life over and over again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hopefully fucking up less and less each</v>

2170
01:36:50.721 --> 01:36:52.430
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but most likely you're going to still</v>

2171
01:36:52.431 --> 01:36:54.560
<v Speaker 3>fuck up and you just going to keep doing</v>
<v Speaker 3>the same thing.</v>

2172
01:36:54.740 --> 01:36:55.790
<v Speaker 3>He'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no fucking way.</v>

2173
01:36:56.030 --> 01:36:57.860
<v Speaker 3>But if someone says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you want to end your life right now?</v>

2174
01:36:57.890 --> 01:36:58.551
<v Speaker 3>You'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2175
01:36:58.551 --> 01:37:00.350
<v Speaker 3>I love my life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you were on that plane and your</v>

2176
01:37:00.351 --> 01:37:01.460
<v Speaker 3>whole body was shaking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

2177
01:37:01.490 --> 01:37:04.070
<v Speaker 3>I want to stay alive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to die.</v>

2178
01:37:04.190 --> 01:37:06.710
<v Speaker 3>So why don't you want to stay alive and</v>
<v Speaker 3>just keep doing it over and over and</v>

2179
01:37:06.711 --> 01:37:07.350
<v Speaker 3>over and over?</v>

2180
01:37:07.350 --> 01:37:08.970
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2181
01:37:08.971 --> 01:37:11.610
<v Speaker 2>is there a goal?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If there's a goal I can get with it.</v>

2182
01:37:12.540 --> 01:37:15.050
<v Speaker 2>So transcendent meaning we evolve hogs</v>
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2186
01:37:22.120 --> 01:37:26.940
<v Speaker 2>You got to watch some other movies then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I love dumb nineties eighties</v>

2187
01:37:26.941 --> 01:37:29.520
<v Speaker 2>movies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like a lot of them to genre that I</v>

2188
01:37:29.521 --> 01:37:33.360
<v Speaker 2>really like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean like blues brothers might be top</v>

2189
01:37:33.361 --> 01:37:36.560
<v Speaker 2>five easily for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Christmas vacations,</v>

2190
01:37:36.580 --> 01:37:38.670
<v Speaker 2>good movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't seen that one.</v>

2191
01:37:38.671 --> 01:37:40.230
<v Speaker 2>But yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're feeling me.</v>

2192
01:37:40.520 --> 01:37:41.251
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if there's,</v>

2193
01:37:41.251 --> 01:37:43.230
<v Speaker 2>if there's something that you evolve</v>
<v Speaker 2>into,</v>

2194
01:37:43.231 --> 01:37:46.620
<v Speaker 2>I can live my life over many times and</v>
<v Speaker 2>strive to be better at it,</v>

2195
01:37:46.621 --> 01:37:49.770
<v Speaker 2>but if there's no point to it all and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>just have to keep living over and over</v>

2196
01:37:49.771 --> 01:37:51.360
<v Speaker 2>and going to high school again and again</v>
<v Speaker 2>and again.</v>

2197
01:37:51.361 --> 01:37:52.110
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

2198
01:37:52.110 --> 01:37:55.830
<v Speaker 3>Well don't you think that human beings</v>
<v Speaker 3>overall are evolving?</v>

2199
01:37:56.710 --> 01:37:58.030
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>

2200
01:37:58.380 --> 01:37:59.490
<v Speaker 3>I didn't even,</v>
<v Speaker 3>besides,</v>

2201
01:37:59.520 --> 01:38:03.780
<v Speaker 3>I think even our trials and tribulations</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the things that go sideways,</v>

2202
01:38:03.810 --> 01:38:08.100
<v Speaker 3>they revealed sideways is an option to</v>
<v Speaker 3>us and gets us back on track.</v>

2203
01:38:08.440 --> 01:38:11.680
<v Speaker 2>I have an expression that my mother</v>
<v Speaker 2>loves onward and sideways.</v>

2204
01:38:14.410 --> 01:38:16.600
<v Speaker 2>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kind of gets you up in the morning when</v>

2205
01:38:16.601 --> 01:38:18.280
<v Speaker 2>you were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't do it anymore.</v>

2206
01:38:18.680 --> 01:38:22.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like that and I like the idea of,</v>

2207
01:38:22.210 --> 01:38:25.870
<v Speaker 2>I'm very into,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as we sort of evolve.</v>

2208
01:38:26.290 --> 01:38:30.460
<v Speaker 2>Speaking of Ufo conferences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was driven in the back of Rick Ruben's</v>

2209
01:38:31.210 --> 01:38:33.850
<v Speaker 2>Bentley.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I first moved to La.</v>

2210
01:38:33.880 --> 01:38:38.140
<v Speaker 2>My friend Nora was friends with him and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he drove us to Ufo conference and I just</v>

2211
01:38:38.141 --> 01:38:41.950
<v Speaker 2>remember sitting in the back of this</v>
<v Speaker 2>huge Bentley and he wouldn't talk to me</v>

2212
01:38:41.951 --> 01:38:46.210
<v Speaker 2>at all like I was like not of interest</v>
<v Speaker 2>enough to,</v>

2213
01:38:46.270 --> 01:38:49.600
<v Speaker 2>I kept sort of poking my head up to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>front seat to like try to contribute to</v>

2214
01:38:49.601 --> 01:38:51.550
<v Speaker 2>the conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like yeah,</v>

2215
01:38:51.730 --> 01:38:54.070
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he just like ignored everything I said</v>

2216
01:38:54.940 --> 01:38:58.600
<v Speaker 2>and they were talking about the</v>
<v Speaker 2>evolution of human consciousness at this</v>

2217
01:38:58.690 --> 01:39:01.270
<v Speaker 2>crazy UFO conference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was pretty funny.</v>

2218
01:39:01.271 --> 01:39:04.630
<v Speaker 2>It was very organized.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just like any like NAM or</v>

2219
01:39:04.631 --> 01:39:05.850
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like anything.</v>

2220
01:39:05.980 --> 01:39:07.750
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have some good ones,</v>

2221
01:39:08.140 --> 01:39:08.561
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

2222
01:39:08.561 --> 01:39:11.980
<v Speaker 3>there's a business in it though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the real issue with all the UFO</v>

2223
01:39:11.981 --> 01:39:16.630
<v Speaker 3>stuff is that there's a business is that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get to a point where people realize</v>

2224
01:39:16.631 --> 01:39:18.940
<v Speaker 3>you could,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could make a lot of profit if you</v>

2225
01:39:18.941 --> 01:39:23.941
<v Speaker 3>just start talking about Ufos are</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about extra terrestrial invaders</v>

2226
01:39:24.491 --> 01:39:29.491
<v Speaker 3>that are inevitably coming and when and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then everything gets murky.</v>

2227
01:39:29.890 --> 01:39:32.990
<v Speaker 2>Know it gets real murky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's kind like who's who's being one</v>

2228
01:39:32.991 --> 01:39:35.890
<v Speaker 2>science and well you need to approach</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

2229
01:39:36.990 --> 01:39:39.960
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not always pure.</v>

2230
01:39:40.020 --> 01:39:42.330
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like there's some people that look at it</v>

2231
01:39:42.331 --> 01:39:46.320
<v Speaker 3>and that are like real researchers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like this is a bunch of them that try to</v>

2232
01:39:46.321 --> 01:39:48.600
<v Speaker 3>figure out what the fuck is going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they make a lot of sense,</v>

2233
01:39:48.810 --> 01:39:49.361
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they're,</v>

2234
01:39:49.361 --> 01:39:50.490
<v Speaker 3>they're trying to figure it out but they</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't,</v>

2235
01:39:50.580 --> 01:39:53.040
<v Speaker 3>they don't point to anything in</v>
<v Speaker 3>particular and say this,</v>

2236
01:39:53.041 --> 01:39:55.560
<v Speaker 3>this little fetus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is an alien baby and we're going to</v>

2237
01:39:55.561 --> 01:39:56.910
<v Speaker 3>use genes to prove it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2238
01:39:56.940 --> 01:39:59.010
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they found that little baby with a big</v>

2239
01:39:59.011 --> 01:39:59.940
<v Speaker 3>head,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just a baby,</v>

2240
01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:01.200
<v Speaker 3>just a deformed baby.</v>

2241
01:40:01.830 --> 01:40:03.930
<v Speaker 2>But what they're really looking for is</v>
<v Speaker 2>aerial phenomenon,</v>

2242
01:40:04.020 --> 01:40:04.840
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's</v>

2243
01:40:04.840 --> 01:40:07.060
<v Speaker 3>Ariel phenomenon is one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But phenomena.</v>

2244
01:40:07.270 --> 01:40:10.810
<v Speaker 3>The problem isn't a phenomenon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Phenomena.</v>

2245
01:40:10.890 --> 01:40:13.090
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Phenomena.</v>

2246
01:40:13.900 --> 01:40:17.050
<v Speaker 3>The problem is we don't know who stuffed</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is.</v>

2247
01:40:17.080 --> 01:40:18.520
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If it's ours,</v>

2248
01:40:18.550 --> 01:40:20.320
<v Speaker 3>it's flying around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't tell you about it.</v>

2249
01:40:20.770 --> 01:40:23.940
<v Speaker 3>If it's some drones at the government's</v>
<v Speaker 3>working on cut,</v>

2250
01:40:23.940 --> 01:40:26.670
<v Speaker 2>that kind of maneuverability,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why aren't they using it?</v>

2251
01:40:26.970 --> 01:40:29.970
<v Speaker 2>What kind of maneuverability?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You convinced they have a,</v>

2252
01:40:29.971 --> 01:40:34.971
<v Speaker 2>they can move great speeds at odd angles</v>
<v Speaker 2>is what I understand.</v>

2253
01:40:35.700 --> 01:40:37.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't see us.</v>

2254
01:40:37.650 --> 01:40:38.790
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they couldn't get here.</v>

2255
01:40:38.810 --> 01:40:39.541
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's the thing,</v>

2256
01:40:39.541 --> 01:40:44.541
<v Speaker 2>they couldn't get here unless they were</v>
<v Speaker 2>able to actually like tesseract what</v>

2257
01:40:45.001 --> 01:40:48.210
<v Speaker 2>does that word tesseract from wrinkle in</v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

2258
01:40:49.040 --> 01:40:51.190
<v Speaker 2>Like a girl book that was out now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2259
01:40:51.191 --> 01:40:52.470
<v Speaker 2>It's a movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't seen the movie,</v>

2260
01:40:52.500 --> 01:40:55.420
<v Speaker 2>but it's nice flag.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get my box set.</v>

2261
01:41:00.240 --> 01:41:03.270
<v Speaker 1>So they fold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They full time horizon.</v>

2262
01:41:03.770 --> 01:41:05.720
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2263
01:41:05.721 --> 01:41:06.980
<v Speaker 2>but I'm sure I'm familiar with it.</v>

2264
01:41:06.990 --> 01:41:09.030
<v Speaker 1>That's fucking movies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Scary space.</v>

2265
01:41:12.080 --> 01:41:16.530
<v Speaker 1>Who's in that movie?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Laurence Fishburne and a bunch of other</v>

2266
01:41:16.531 --> 01:41:17.610
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sam,</v>

2267
01:41:17.611 --> 01:41:20.670
<v Speaker 1>the guy from Jurassic Park.</v>
<v Speaker 1>English gentlemen.</v>

2268
01:41:21.930 --> 01:41:24.000
<v Speaker 1>Uh dammit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to say Harris with the son's</v>

2269
01:41:24.001 --> 01:41:25.770
<v Speaker 1>name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the older guy.</v>

2270
01:41:25.820 --> 01:41:28.020
<v Speaker 1>The grandfather?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2271
01:41:28.050 --> 01:41:31.470
<v Speaker 1>the one who was Sam Neill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sam Neil.</v>

2272
01:41:31.500 --> 01:41:34.320
<v Speaker 1>He was one of the scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the top scientists.</v>

2273
01:41:34.321 --> 01:41:36.390
<v Speaker 1>They went there with Laura dern.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was like Laura durrance boyfriend.</v>

2274
01:41:36.780 --> 01:41:38.250
<v Speaker 1>He's English.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2275
01:41:39.240 --> 01:41:42.150
<v Speaker 1>Pretty sure theory is there's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>gentleman that's the event horizon.</v>

2276
01:41:42.300 --> 01:41:43.750
<v Speaker 1>English accent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2277
01:41:43.770 --> 01:41:46.470
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean maybe he's just so</v>
<v Speaker 1>proper.</v>

2278
01:41:46.471 --> 01:41:48.690
<v Speaker 1>I think he's English.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he's English.</v>

2279
01:41:48.870 --> 01:41:50.790
<v Speaker 1>That'll blow my mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The movie's bad ass though.</v>

2280
01:41:50.820 --> 01:41:54.270
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the best horror slash</v>
<v Speaker 1>science fiction movies ever.</v>

2281
01:41:54.300 --> 01:41:58.080
<v Speaker 1>They combined like a demonic movie with</v>
<v Speaker 1>space.</v>

2282
01:41:58.081 --> 01:41:58.980
<v Speaker 1>It was demons in space.</v>

2283
01:42:00.160 --> 01:42:01.750
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like this.</v>

2284
01:42:01.790 --> 01:42:04.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The aliens are actually demons</v>

2285
01:42:04.590 --> 01:42:07.230
<v Speaker 1>sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They punched through a wormhole in order</v>

2286
01:42:07.231 --> 01:42:10.470
<v Speaker 1>to travel this far and when they did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they opened up a passage to hell</v>

2287
01:42:10.670 --> 01:42:12.060
<v Speaker 2>straight the dimension.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tom.</v>

2288
01:42:12.061 --> 01:42:16.220
<v Speaker 2>Tom Don't paint well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hell being what we would do to extra</v>

2289
01:42:16.221 --> 01:42:17.180
<v Speaker 2>terrestrials.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2290
01:42:17.181 --> 01:42:20.120
<v Speaker 2>think about who we are to an alien</v>
<v Speaker 2>civilization.</v>

2291
01:42:20.121 --> 01:42:21.830
<v Speaker 2>Let's just say they're peaceful and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not.</v>

2292
01:42:21.831 --> 01:42:24.590
<v Speaker 2>I mean like imagine us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although we'd probably be like so</v>

2293
01:42:24.591 --> 01:42:26.080
<v Speaker 2>evolutionarily backward,</v>

2294
01:42:26.780 --> 01:42:28.430
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would probably be like if we had a</v>

2295
01:42:28.431 --> 01:42:33.431
<v Speaker 1>giant hamster wheel and visited a crazy</v>
<v Speaker 1>arm chimps and you're like Whoa,</v>

2296
01:42:33.830 --> 01:42:36.320
<v Speaker 1>slow the fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know.</v>

2297
01:42:36.830 --> 01:42:39.880
<v Speaker 1>They probably would be really aware that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're super violent,</v>

2298
01:42:40.370 --> 01:42:44.600
<v Speaker 1>would shoot at them and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They probably would do something to slow</v>

2299
01:42:44.601 --> 01:42:45.434
<v Speaker 1>that down.</v>

2300
01:42:45.600 --> 01:42:46.740
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>officially high.</v>

2301
01:42:46.741 --> 01:42:48.980
<v Speaker 2>Like I can feel it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just happen to me.</v>

2302
01:42:49.060 --> 01:42:49.990
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no doubt.</v>

2303
01:42:50.040 --> 01:42:50.873
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2304
01:42:54.130 --> 01:42:55.060
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2305
01:42:56.110 --> 01:42:57.970
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever been to one of my</v>
<v Speaker 2>concerts?</v>

2306
01:42:58.110 --> 01:43:01.680
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does that bum you out?</v>

2307
01:43:01.780 --> 01:43:02.613
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not at all.</v>

2308
01:43:03.010 --> 01:43:05.500
<v Speaker 2>I was going to ask you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause I was assuming it was pretty early</v>

2309
01:43:05.501 --> 01:43:06.610
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going out,</v>

2310
01:43:06.611 --> 01:43:09.760
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to plugging myself now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm going out and I'm playing all</v>

2311
01:43:09.761 --> 01:43:14.410
<v Speaker 2>these songs that I haven't played ever</v>
<v Speaker 2>really live that I wrote.</v>

2312
01:43:14.470 --> 01:43:15.880
<v Speaker 2>Grab that microphone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>

2313
01:43:16.870 --> 01:43:19.300
<v Speaker 1>Stay with me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stay with me.</v>

2314
01:43:19.450 --> 01:43:21.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to whisper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When are you performing out here?</v>

2315
01:43:21.820 --> 01:43:22.350
<v Speaker 1>Soon</v>

2316
01:43:22.350 --> 01:43:25.260
<v Speaker 2>I will be like eight shows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'll come and go.</v>

2317
01:43:25.261 --> 01:43:28.170
<v Speaker 2>Kind of like a shooting star through the</v>
<v Speaker 2>sky.</v>

2318
01:43:31.210 --> 01:43:34.090
<v Speaker 1>What are you going to be here happening</v>
<v Speaker 1>now joe?</v>

2319
01:43:34.480 --> 01:43:39.480
<v Speaker 1>Get down here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure June I'm in,</v>

2320
01:43:41.470 --> 01:43:42.190
<v Speaker 1>but it's kind of</v>

2321
01:43:42.190 --> 01:43:47.170
<v Speaker 2>an interesting thing if you play stuff</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is from from a really long time ago</v>

2322
01:43:47.171 --> 01:43:52.171
<v Speaker 2>and it was pretty rudimentary on stage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can you trick it out with a base?</v>

2323
01:43:53.060 --> 01:43:56.270
<v Speaker 2>Can you trick it out with drums?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you go back and like reinvent your</v>

2324
01:43:56.271 --> 01:43:59.210
<v Speaker 2>early work?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that that would be like,</v>

2325
01:43:59.990 --> 01:44:01.940
<v Speaker 2>would that upset an old fan?</v>

2326
01:44:02.820 --> 01:44:05.670
<v Speaker 1>You mean if an old fan wanted to hear it</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way it was?</v>

2327
01:44:06.310 --> 01:44:07.560
<v Speaker 1>Like if you had an acoustic version,</v>

2328
01:44:07.740 --> 01:44:11.970
<v Speaker 2>did they want me to just exactly hit</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly how I played at?</v>

2329
01:44:11.971 --> 01:44:12.804
<v Speaker 2>Probably right.</v>

2330
01:44:14.130 --> 01:44:17.010
<v Speaker 1>Are Don't think that you can leave that</v>
<v Speaker 1>up to vote</v>

2331
01:44:17.290 --> 01:44:20.980
<v Speaker 2>cause I was thinking it would help my</v>
<v Speaker 2>voice to be a stoner since I was a</v>

2332
01:44:20.981 --> 01:44:21.814
<v Speaker 2>stoner back.</v>

2333
01:44:22.600 --> 01:44:24.330
<v Speaker 1>So you're thinking about getting into</v>
<v Speaker 1>being a stone now.</v>

2334
01:44:24.350 --> 01:44:28.520
<v Speaker 1>I might,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you make it good stoner sitting around</v>

2335
01:44:28.521 --> 01:44:31.180
<v Speaker 1>and talking about black holes and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Perfect dose.</v>

2336
01:44:31.220 --> 01:44:33.280
<v Speaker 1>You believe in ghosts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like all that shit sober though.</v>

2337
01:44:33.330 --> 01:44:34.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the scary part.</v>

2338
01:44:34.800 --> 01:44:37.510
<v Speaker 1>Well I think most people do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think most people that are</v>

2339
01:44:37.720 --> 01:44:39.040
<v Speaker 1>watching those go shows are high.</v>

2340
01:44:39.660 --> 01:44:40.493
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2341
01:44:40.500 --> 01:44:42.590
<v Speaker 2>the Internet is like the paranormal.</v>

2342
01:44:43.160 --> 01:44:46.180
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well it's library things that people are</v>

2343
01:44:46.181 --> 01:44:48.910
<v Speaker 1>curious about and they're fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if ghosts were real,</v>

2344
01:44:48.911 --> 01:44:50.620
<v Speaker 1>it'd be fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'd be awesome.</v>

2345
01:44:51.010 --> 01:44:53.360
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wouldn't be fun if they weren't real</v>

2346
01:44:53.361 --> 01:44:53.891
<v Speaker 1>and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2347
01:44:53.891 --> 01:44:57.250
<v Speaker 1>you mean all those shows where you've</v>
<v Speaker 1>never been scared by ghost.</v>

2348
01:44:57.251 --> 01:45:00.730
<v Speaker 1>You've never actually like even thought</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've definitely been scared.</v>

2349
01:45:00.910 --> 01:45:03.040
<v Speaker 1>I never thought animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2350
01:45:03.041 --> 01:45:05.590
<v Speaker 1>I've been through the comedy store,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was been,</v>

2351
01:45:06.130 --> 01:45:07.960
<v Speaker 1>apparently a bunch of people get</v>
<v Speaker 1>murdered there.</v>

2352
01:45:08.020 --> 01:45:13.020
<v Speaker 1>When Bugsy Siegel owned it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he used to be Ciro's nightclub and a lot</v>

2353
01:45:13.091 --> 01:45:15.070
<v Speaker 1>of people that worked there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>apparently I've seen ghosts.</v>

2354
01:45:15.160 --> 01:45:17.180
<v Speaker 1>Like even my friends told me they seen</v>
<v Speaker 1>goes.</v>

2355
01:45:18.230 --> 01:45:19.300
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno.</v>

2356
01:45:19.360 --> 01:45:21.760
<v Speaker 1>What did they say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did they said they saw ghosts?</v>

2357
01:45:21.830 --> 01:45:23.880
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe they were talking to human look.</v>

2358
01:45:23.890 --> 01:45:28.270
<v Speaker 1>I've never seen an actual human effort.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some have told me they were grabbed.</v>

2359
01:45:28.270 --> 01:45:31.120
<v Speaker 1>Carla boasts that he was grabbed and</v>
<v Speaker 1>dragged.</v>

2360
01:45:31.121 --> 01:45:34.450
<v Speaker 1>He was in a dark room and something</v>
<v Speaker 1>grabbed him and dragged him on the</v>

2361
01:45:34.451 --> 01:45:38.200
<v Speaker 1>ground and then ran through the place</v>
<v Speaker 1>and slam the door outside.</v>

2362
01:45:38.260 --> 01:45:39.640
<v Speaker 1>You're kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what he said.</v>

2363
01:45:40.270 --> 01:45:42.640
<v Speaker 1>Could it have been a person?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could have been for sure.</v>

2364
01:45:42.700 --> 01:45:44.260
<v Speaker 1>The people are real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2365
01:45:44.261 --> 01:45:46.510
<v Speaker 1>it's more likely a person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's in a pitch black room.</v>

2366
01:45:46.540 --> 01:45:49.060
<v Speaker 1>It might have been one of his asshole</v>
<v Speaker 1>friends side to grab him cause he's</v>

2367
01:45:49.061 --> 01:45:51.450
<v Speaker 1>probably drunk off his ass laying down</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

2368
01:45:51.451 --> 01:45:54.520
<v Speaker 1>Like I think you had a fight with his</v>
<v Speaker 1>wife or something like that.</v>

2369
01:45:54.950 --> 01:45:56.570
<v Speaker 1>Went to the comic store.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like fuck this.</v>

2370
01:45:56.571 --> 01:45:57.161
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I lie here,</v>

2371
01:45:57.161 --> 01:45:59.190
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna make it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be a big man.</v>

2372
01:45:59.191 --> 01:46:01.360
<v Speaker 1>And then something like came into the</v>
<v Speaker 1>room,</v>

2373
01:46:01.361 --> 01:46:03.610
<v Speaker 1>he tells the whole story on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really kind of interesting the way</v>

2374
01:46:03.611 --> 01:46:04.060
<v Speaker 1>he tells it.</v>

2375
01:46:04.060 --> 01:46:06.370
<v Speaker 1>Cause he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's very dramatic and goes through the</v>

2376
01:46:06.371 --> 01:46:10.630
<v Speaker 1>whole detail of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I've talked to several waitstaff,</v>

2377
01:46:10.900 --> 01:46:14.200
<v Speaker 1>waitresses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>managers that have seen ghost there.</v>

2378
01:46:14.740 --> 01:46:16.000
<v Speaker 1>Comics who've seen ghosts there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

2379
01:46:16.010 --> 01:46:17.810
<v Speaker 1>but again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people were full of Shit.</v>

2380
01:46:18.130 --> 01:46:19.360
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2381
01:46:19.361 --> 01:46:22.870

<v Speaker 1>And that one out of a hundred might tell</v>

2382

<v Speaker 1>you some goofy ass fucking store cause</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want to be special.</v>

2383
01:46:26.390 --> 01:46:28.060
<v Speaker 1>But what happened to you that made you</v>
<v Speaker 1>scared?</v>

2384
01:46:28.540 --> 01:46:29.770
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>normal stuff.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm just freaked out to be.</v>

2386
01:46:31.811 --> 01:46:35.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm more scared of animals than anything</v>

2387
01:46:35.261 --> 01:46:37.240
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The real things,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Huge giant.</v>

2390
01:46:43.450 --> 01:46:45.250

<v Speaker 1>I stumbled.</v>

2391
01:46:45.280 --> 01:46:48.320
<v Speaker 1>You shot a moose kill in the first time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2392
01:46:49.230 --> 01:46:51.420
<v Speaker 1>I ate it could for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2393
01:46:51.540 --> 01:46:52.500

<v Speaker 1>Hunting.</v>

2394
01:46:52.530 --> 01:46:53.363
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2395
01:46:53.880 --> 01:46:54.713
<v Speaker 1>it's the way to do it.</v>

2396
01:46:56.800 --> 01:46:58.020
<v Speaker 1>Fucking huge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

2397
01:46:58.021 --> 01:46:59.400
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't even look like a real animal.</v>

2398
01:46:59.401 --> 01:47:01.920
<v Speaker 1>The first time I saw him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one in British Columbia,</v>

2399
01:47:01.921 --> 01:47:03.990
<v Speaker 1>it looked like it was like a scene from</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jurassic Park.</v>

2400
01:47:03.991 --> 01:47:06.150
<v Speaker 1>We pulled,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we pulled the car over and we rolled the</v>

2401
01:47:06.151 --> 01:47:06.931
<v Speaker 1>windows down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're like,</v>

2402
01:47:06.931 --> 01:47:10.890
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at that thing is so big.</v>

2403
01:47:11.010 --> 01:47:15.180
<v Speaker 1>I think I could walk under it and clear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might be able to really think like</v>

2404
01:47:15.181 --> 01:47:16.650
<v Speaker 1>their legs are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2405
01:47:16.700 --> 01:47:19.140
<v Speaker 1>you a little duck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's the worst.</v>

2406
01:47:19.290 --> 01:47:20.940
<v Speaker 1>They're so big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't even make sense.</v>

2407
01:47:21.090 --> 01:47:23.520
<v Speaker 1>Like you feel like you could drive a car</v>
<v Speaker 1>under them.</v>

2408
01:47:23.550 --> 01:47:24.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2409
01:47:24.630 --> 01:47:26.730
<v Speaker 1>They're enormous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're the redwoods of deer.</v>

2410
01:47:27.060 --> 01:47:31.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Crazy animal grows giant doors on its</v>

2411
01:47:31.021 --> 01:47:34.830
<v Speaker 1>head every year and then they fall off</v>
<v Speaker 1>after the done breeding,</v>

2412
01:47:35.130 --> 01:47:37.050
<v Speaker 1>the horns fall off and they regrow</v>
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>

2413
01:47:37.530 --> 01:47:39.720
<v Speaker 1>Did you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did you have to wait for a long time to</v>

2414
01:47:39.840 --> 01:47:40.650
<v Speaker 1>get it?</v>

2415
01:47:40.650 --> 01:47:41.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were.</v>

2416
01:47:41.790 --> 01:47:44.760
<v Speaker 1>We were there for like five days and we</v>
<v Speaker 1>got it on the fifth day.</v>

2417
01:47:44.790 --> 01:47:46.440
<v Speaker 1>The fourth or the fifth day?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2418
01:47:46.830 --> 01:47:48.140
<v Speaker 1>same animal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You saw it.</v>

2419
01:47:48.240 --> 01:47:48.721
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2420
01:47:48.721 --> 01:47:50.010
<v Speaker 1>we didn't seem one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're looking at,</v>

2421
01:47:50.011 --> 01:47:52.700
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of wolves up there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you allowed to shoot the wolf?</v>

2422
01:47:52.730 --> 01:47:54.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They tried to get you to kill as many as</v>

2423
01:47:54.391 --> 01:47:55.350
<v Speaker 1>you can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't.</v>

2424
01:47:55.440 --> 01:47:56.400
<v Speaker 1>I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to,</v>

2425
01:47:56.580 --> 01:48:00.000
<v Speaker 1>but if you're up there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they give you an unlimited tag for</v>

2426
01:48:00.001 --> 01:48:01.860
<v Speaker 1>wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could shoot 30 walls,</v>

2427
01:48:01.861 --> 01:48:03.690
<v Speaker 1>but you won't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll never get 30 of them.</v>

2428
01:48:03.720 --> 01:48:06.620
<v Speaker 1>They're smart as shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we did come across a baby moose.</v>

2429
01:48:06.621 --> 01:48:08.130
<v Speaker 1>I got eaten by a wolf.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

2430
01:48:08.160 --> 01:48:10.530
<v Speaker 1>it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A pack of wolves was hair everywhere.</v>

2431
01:48:10.531 --> 01:48:13.080
<v Speaker 1>That was the most surprising thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just fucking hair.</v>

2432
01:48:13.440 --> 01:48:14.820
<v Speaker 1>I didn't think there would be hair</v>
<v Speaker 1>everywhere,</v>

2433
01:48:14.821 --> 01:48:16.650
<v Speaker 1>but I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course they're going to kill this</v>

2434
01:48:16.651 --> 01:48:18.330
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have to chew off the hair.</v>

2435
01:48:18.610 --> 01:48:19.600
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Spit it out.</v>

2436
01:48:19.601 --> 01:48:21.370
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every meal,</v>

2437
01:48:21.460 --> 01:48:23.670
<v Speaker 2>every meal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And animal eats has like all this</v>

2438
01:48:23.710 --> 01:48:26.070
<v Speaker 2>correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the snow one preparing it there.</v>

2439
01:48:26.080 --> 01:48:28.200
<v Speaker 2>No knives and forks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can't lay in their shit</v>

2440
01:48:28.310 --> 01:48:30.890
<v Speaker 1>to see ropes of hair and their shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

2441
01:48:30.920 --> 01:48:31.670
<v Speaker 1>girl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2442
01:48:31.670 --> 01:48:36.410
<v Speaker 1>They don't just eat the meat like nice</v>
<v Speaker 1>and clean like a bowl and chopped up</v>

2443
01:48:36.411 --> 01:48:37.101
<v Speaker 1>meat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2444
01:48:37.101 --> 01:48:38.480
<v Speaker 1>they're eating the hair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything.</v>

2445
01:48:39.170 --> 01:48:39.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2446
01:48:39.970 --> 01:48:43.330
<v Speaker 2>I used to look at those like wild horse</v>
<v Speaker 2>videos and they would show that pack of</v>

2447
01:48:43.331 --> 01:48:45.250
<v Speaker 2>wild horses and I would try to think</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2448
01:48:45.610 --> 01:48:49.300
<v Speaker 2>is it better?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's better to be like stabled and</v>

2449
01:48:49.301 --> 01:48:51.310
<v Speaker 2>in a clean with Nice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2450
01:48:51.311 --> 01:48:56.230
<v Speaker 2>sawdust or whatever in your pen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like maybe it's not so bad to be a kept</v>

2451
01:48:56.310 --> 01:48:57.790
<v Speaker 2>animal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure.</v>

2452
01:48:57.791 --> 01:48:59.440
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to be a wild horse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2453
01:48:59.441 --> 01:49:02.330
<v Speaker 2>it seems really romantic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but would it really be fun?</v>

2454
01:49:02.930 --> 01:49:06.360
<v Speaker 1>It's a great rolling stone song.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think what it is is,</v>

2455
01:49:06.361 --> 01:49:07.194
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

2456
01:49:07.290 --> 01:49:10.800
<v Speaker 1>they're not the same thing that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>used to be.</v>

2457
01:49:11.030 --> 01:49:12.320
<v Speaker 2>They're not the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're right.</v>

2458
01:49:12.321 --> 01:49:14.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've been domesticated for so long.</v>

2459
01:49:14.210 --> 01:49:15.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not even the same animal,</v>

2460
01:49:15.741 --> 01:49:17.030
<v Speaker 2>really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you know what to see what that</v>

2461
01:49:17.031 --> 01:49:18.800
<v Speaker 2>genetic memory thing you're talking?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2462
01:49:18.950 --> 01:49:21.320
<v Speaker 1>Do you know scrub bullous?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ever heard of that expression?</v>

2463
01:49:21.321 --> 01:49:23.270
<v Speaker 1>Scramble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Scrub bowls are wild.</v>

2464
01:49:23.540 --> 01:49:24.920
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>domestic cattle,</v>

2465
01:49:25.340 --> 01:49:29.330
<v Speaker 1>domestic cattle that's broken down</v>
<v Speaker 1>barriers and gone wild and has lived in</v>

2466
01:49:29.331 --> 01:49:32.420
<v Speaker 1>the wild for several generations to</v>
<v Speaker 1>change their form.</v>

2467
01:49:32.750 --> 01:49:34.340
<v Speaker 1>They look different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They look,</v>

2468
01:49:34.341 --> 01:49:37.700
<v Speaker 1>they're much more muscular.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're freaky looking multicolored.</v>

2469
01:49:37.701 --> 01:49:41.210
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes they have grow giant antlers</v>
<v Speaker 1>are giant horns rather.</v>

2470
01:49:41.211 --> 01:49:43.490
<v Speaker 1>And it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Australia has a real issue with them and</v>

2471
01:49:43.491 --> 01:49:45.380
<v Speaker 1>they're super,</v>
<v Speaker 1>super aggressive.</v>

2472
01:49:45.560 --> 01:49:48.010
<v Speaker 1>When you think about bull riding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people ride bowls and the</v>

2473
01:49:48.100 --> 01:49:49.900
<v Speaker 3>go fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what a bull does.</v>

2474
01:49:49.901 --> 01:49:53.170
<v Speaker 3>Bowls are ruthless motherfuckers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're just out there trying to have</v>

2475
01:49:53.171 --> 01:49:55.960
<v Speaker 3>sex with cow and anything that gets</v>
<v Speaker 3>anywhere near them,</v>

2476
01:49:55.961 --> 01:50:00.961
<v Speaker 3>they'll fuck up because they're giant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So these things just roam wild and there</v>

2477
01:50:01.151 --> 01:50:03.190
<v Speaker 3>are different animal now and people hunt</v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

2478
01:50:03.191 --> 01:50:05.770
<v Speaker 3>It's very strange.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is a,</v>

2479
01:50:05.830 --> 01:50:10.030
<v Speaker 3>that's a wild animal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These horses are still the same form as</v>

2480
01:50:10.031 --> 01:50:12.430
<v Speaker 3>when people domesticated them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just got loose.</v>

2481
01:50:12.700 --> 01:50:13.533
<v Speaker 3>And so they're just running around</v>

2482
01:50:13.560 --> 01:50:16.050
<v Speaker 1>trying to find something to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not real wild.</v>

2483
01:50:16.051 --> 01:50:17.280
<v Speaker 1>Wild.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're wild.</v>

2484
01:50:17.281 --> 01:50:20.280
<v Speaker 1>Horses are not native to North America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>

2485
01:50:20.910 --> 01:50:23.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were brought in to North America.</v>

2486
01:50:23.100 --> 01:50:24.960
<v Speaker 1>The native Americans did not have</v>
<v Speaker 1>horses.</v>

2487
01:50:25.050 --> 01:50:28.500
<v Speaker 1>We brought them in from Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did not know that.</v>

2488
01:50:28.560 --> 01:50:32.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well what's crazy is horse is originated</v>

2489
01:50:32.130 --> 01:50:35.820
<v Speaker 1>in North America many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many eons ago,</v>

2490
01:50:35.970 --> 01:50:40.650
<v Speaker 3>but then died off in North America but</v>
<v Speaker 3>prospered overseas in different places</v>

2491
01:50:40.651 --> 01:50:44.040
<v Speaker 3>like possibly when across the bering</v>
<v Speaker 3>land mash and all these different places</v>

2492
01:50:44.041 --> 01:50:49.041
<v Speaker 3>where horses evolved and became zebras</v>
<v Speaker 3>and all these other different animals</v>

2493
01:50:49.460 --> 01:50:52.560
<v Speaker 3>like and then they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Europeans brought the horse back to</v>

2494
01:50:52.561 --> 01:50:54.870
<v Speaker 3>North America.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the horse originated in North</v>

2495
01:50:54.871 --> 01:50:58.530
<v Speaker 3>America but then died off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So these wild horses,</v>

2496
01:50:58.531 --> 01:51:00.210
<v Speaker 3>they're just domestic horses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They got free.</v>

2497
01:51:01.120 --> 01:51:02.830
<v Speaker 1>So it is kind of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2498
01:51:03.040 --> 01:51:04.300
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of shitty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't really,</v>

2499
01:51:04.301 --> 01:51:08.170
<v Speaker 3>they probably like if you see a really</v>
<v Speaker 3>well taken care of horace,</v>

2500
01:51:08.171 --> 01:51:11.740
<v Speaker 3>they don't seem to mind it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if there's a place up here that has</v>

2501
01:51:11.741 --> 01:51:15.010
<v Speaker 3>a stable and people ride their horses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people come by and pet the horses.</v>

2502
01:51:15.011 --> 01:51:18.430
<v Speaker 3>The horses seems so chill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't seem to mind it at all.</v>

2503
01:51:18.610 --> 01:51:20.770
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if it's a loved horse in there taking</v>

2504
01:51:20.771 --> 01:51:24.820
<v Speaker 3>care of and you know they're just</v>
<v Speaker 3>treated well and fed well,</v>

2505
01:51:25.120 --> 01:51:26.560
<v Speaker 3>they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't seem to mind.</v>

2506
01:51:26.650 --> 01:51:31.630
<v Speaker 1>How do they not mind that hugely heavy</v>
<v Speaker 1>saddle and that hugely heavy human</v>

2507
01:51:31.631 --> 01:51:36.631
<v Speaker 1>beings only hugely heavy to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The amount of so happy that a horse has.</v>

2508
01:51:37.080 --> 01:51:39.340
<v Speaker 1>Do you deal with that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about what does a big horse way?</v>

2509
01:51:40.060 --> 01:51:41.860
<v Speaker 1>Thousand Pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>2000 pounds.</v>

2510
01:51:42.460 --> 01:51:45.220
<v Speaker 1>It's like you remember when your son was</v>
<v Speaker 1>really little,</v>

2511
01:51:45.250 --> 01:51:46.950
<v Speaker 1>he put them on your shoulders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't really bother you.</v>

2512
01:51:49.580 --> 01:51:52.970
<v Speaker 3>What it's like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then think of the mass that a horse</v>

2513
01:51:52.971 --> 01:51:56.120
<v Speaker 3>carries around just a bone structure and</v>
<v Speaker 3>the muscle,</v>

2514
01:51:56.420 --> 01:51:59.900
<v Speaker 3>this fucking thing that can jump over</v>
<v Speaker 3>huge stacks.</v>

2515
01:51:59.901 --> 01:52:02.990
<v Speaker 3>A logs with a person on its back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is pretty incredible.</v>

2516
01:52:03.010 --> 01:52:04.160
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're insane.</v>

2517
01:52:04.190 --> 01:52:06.620
<v Speaker 3>So what we are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2518
01:52:06.621 --> 01:52:08.870
<v Speaker 3>if we had to carry a purse around yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was fucking suck.</v>

2519
01:52:09.020 --> 01:52:12.320
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because we got squishy discs in our back</v>

2520
01:52:12.321 --> 01:52:15.680
<v Speaker 3>and our muscles give out and we cramp up</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

2521
01:52:15.681 --> 01:52:16.730
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're in stupid fuck</v>

2522
01:52:16.910 --> 01:52:21.110
<v Speaker 1>shoes and like a horse can carry a</v>
<v Speaker 1>person for a long time.</v>

2523
01:52:21.520 --> 01:52:23.620
<v Speaker 1>I feel a little bad for them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2524
01:52:23.750 --> 01:52:25.760
<v Speaker 1>They probably shouldn't do it when</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're tired.</v>

2525
01:52:25.780 --> 01:52:27.680
<v Speaker 1>Battled a horse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't ride horses.</v>

2526
01:52:27.800 --> 01:52:31.490
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to pull this strap like really</v>

2527
01:52:31.491 --> 01:52:33.770
<v Speaker 1>tightly around their barrel chest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2528
01:52:33.771 --> 01:52:35.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause they do this thing where they,</v>

2529
01:52:36.200 --> 01:52:38.030
<v Speaker 1>when they can tell that you're saddling</v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

2530
01:52:38.780 --> 01:52:41.570
<v Speaker 1>they like stick their bellies out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>

2531
01:52:41.571 --> 01:52:45.800
<v Speaker 1>To try to get to sell some space so that</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you let go they go like this and</v>

2532
01:52:45.801 --> 01:52:46.100
<v Speaker 1>they're more</v>

2533
01:52:46.100 --> 01:52:48.710
<v Speaker 2>comfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you literally have to like Yank this</v>

2534
01:52:48.711 --> 01:52:50.020
<v Speaker 2>thing and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

2535
01:52:50.770 --> 01:52:52.880
<v Speaker 2>on that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise you'll start to slip when</v>

2536
01:52:52.881 --> 01:52:55.490
<v Speaker 2>you're riding,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll just start to fall like slowly.</v>

2537
01:52:59.450 --> 01:53:01.460
<v Speaker 2>I mean it sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why they're always fighting when</v>

2538
01:53:01.461 --> 01:53:03.220
<v Speaker 2>you were on the trail because were like</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

2539
01:53:03.221 --> 01:53:05.060
<v Speaker 2>to just fart all the time anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they probably do.</v>

2540
01:53:05.061 --> 01:53:06.840
<v Speaker 2>I just made that up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want him to sound like I didn't</v>

2541
01:53:06.841 --> 01:53:08.180
<v Speaker 2>want to talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're squeezing them.</v>

2542
01:53:08.181 --> 01:53:09.110
<v Speaker 2>Done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's turnips.</v>

2543
01:53:09.590 --> 01:53:12.200
<v Speaker 2>But they spoke like if they saw a wolf</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'd go nuts.</v>

2544
01:53:12.360 --> 01:53:14.580
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I spoke at a garbage can.</v>

2545
01:53:14.640 --> 01:53:16.650
<v Speaker 3>Do you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why cowboy boots are made that</v>

2546
01:53:16.651 --> 01:53:18.150
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where your feet going,</v>

2547
01:53:18.151 --> 01:53:20.910
<v Speaker 3>I'm loose and then they have the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the heel,</v>

2548
01:53:21.090 --> 01:53:25.020
<v Speaker 3>all that is so that the heel slides on</v>
<v Speaker 3>that thing that your foot sticks in.</v>

2549
01:53:25.021 --> 01:53:26.940
<v Speaker 3>What's that thing called?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Startup stirrup.</v>

2550
01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:30.780
<v Speaker 3>Your foot slides in and locks on that</v>
<v Speaker 3>stirrup with the heel and then if you</v>

2551
01:53:30.781 --> 01:53:33.510
<v Speaker 3>get knocked off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the foot should just comes off.</v>

2552
01:53:34.050 --> 01:53:36.240
<v Speaker 3>You don't get dragged.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2553
01:53:36.300 --> 01:53:40.110
<v Speaker 3>I'll give your foot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you have like hiking boots on with</v>

2554
01:53:40.111 --> 01:53:45.111
<v Speaker 3>like 17 eye holes and you get that bitch</v>
<v Speaker 3>tie down laced in and you shove them</v>

2555
01:53:45.151 --> 01:53:49.080
<v Speaker 3>into those stirrups.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If that fucking horse starts bucking and</v>

2556
01:53:49.081 --> 01:53:51.990
<v Speaker 3>you get knocked loose,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to get dragged and kicked</v>

2557
01:53:51.991 --> 01:53:54.390
<v Speaker 3>to death.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're going to be hanging on by your</v>

2558
01:53:54.391 --> 01:53:56.250
<v Speaker 3>foot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's going to install it on your head.</v>

2559
01:53:56.251 --> 01:53:58.440
<v Speaker 3>As you're running around,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're gonna bounce you off rocks and</v>

2560
01:53:58.441 --> 01:54:00.150
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you're in one of them cowboy</v>

2561
01:54:00.151 --> 01:54:02.010
<v Speaker 3>boots,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you feet just come right out.</v>

2562
01:54:02.300 --> 01:54:04.920
<v Speaker 3>I am now only going to wear cowboy boots</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're riding.</v>

2563
01:54:04.921 --> 01:54:07.890
<v Speaker 3>The horse should only wear cowboy boots.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven't been,</v>

2564
01:54:10.140 --> 01:54:13.920
<v Speaker 3>but that's why they're so slippery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why they come right off to their</v>

2565
01:54:13.921 --> 01:54:16.860
<v Speaker 3>goofy smart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is for horse riding.</v>

2566
01:54:16.980 --> 01:54:20.370
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like people that don't get that and</v>

2567
01:54:20.371 --> 01:54:24.570
<v Speaker 3>try to wear like big ass fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>mountaineering boots and ride a horse</v>

2568
01:54:24.571 --> 01:54:25.360
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2569
01:54:25.360 --> 01:54:28.610
<v Speaker 2>I don't think anyone can fit a big ass</v>
<v Speaker 2>mountain every mood in his church.</v>

2570
01:54:29.500 --> 01:54:31.850
<v Speaker 2>This was a real issue with people that</v>
<v Speaker 2>go mountain hunting.</v>

2571
01:54:32.090 --> 01:54:34.040
<v Speaker 2>I always thought cowboy boots are for</v>
<v Speaker 2>snakes.</v>

2572
01:54:34.070 --> 01:54:36.670
<v Speaker 2>That's why they were like so thick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bet that that's it too.</v>

2573
01:54:36.800 --> 01:54:40.460
<v Speaker 2>I bet that they had to go up high enough</v>
<v Speaker 2>to say that a strike wouldn't get.</v>

2574
01:54:40.490 --> 01:54:41.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2575
01:54:41.850 --> 01:54:43.670
<v Speaker 2>that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's probably a factor too,</v>

2576
01:54:44.200 --> 01:54:47.680
<v Speaker 3>but there's definitely a factor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the way the heels constructed is</v>

2577
01:54:47.681 --> 01:54:50.440
<v Speaker 3>that your stirrup sits right in the heel</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the way your foot just comes right</v>

2578
01:54:50.441 --> 01:54:50.740
<v Speaker 3>off</v>

2579
01:54:50.740 --> 01:54:52.840
<v Speaker 2>and the way the toe goes up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would just stay in.</v>

2580
01:54:53.860 --> 01:54:55.410
<v Speaker 2>You'd go flying or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

2581
01:54:57.500 --> 01:54:58.440
<v Speaker 3>It's really smart,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2582
01:54:58.441 --> 01:55:00.480
<v Speaker 3>What's the point of tears?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really smart tips.</v>

2583
01:55:00.481 --> 01:55:03.240
<v Speaker 3>He gets stuck up there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He foot goes flying out and you're done.</v>

2584
01:55:03.600 --> 01:55:05.970
<v Speaker 2>I know that was a very vivid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now that I'm high,</v>

2585
01:55:05.971 --> 01:55:09.300
<v Speaker 2>like to imagine my head bouncing along</v>
<v Speaker 2>the trail behind the horse.</v>

2586
01:55:10.500 --> 01:55:14.910
<v Speaker 2>Back your head cracking off rocks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She got try to stay conscious.</v>

2587
01:55:14.911 --> 01:55:16.500
<v Speaker 2>Grabbing your head,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your head,</v>

2588
01:55:16.560 --> 01:55:18.930
<v Speaker 2>your hand gets smashed in the ram.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anything.</v>

2589
01:55:18.931 --> 01:55:23.130
<v Speaker 2>You're just a rag doll.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ah Yeah,</v>

2590
01:55:23.370 --> 01:55:25.020
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Declan.</v>

2591
01:55:25.370 --> 01:55:28.440
<v Speaker 2>Oh you're awfully silent over there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does he ever,</v>

2592
01:55:28.740 --> 01:55:31.590
<v Speaker 2>he talks all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a good talker.</v>

2593
01:55:32.670 --> 01:55:34.010
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jamie?</v>

2594
01:55:34.011 --> 01:55:37.620
<v Speaker 2>Smart Guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we could wrap this up if you like.</v>

2595
01:55:37.770 --> 01:55:40.280
<v Speaker 2>She had to be out of here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought 45.</v>

2596
01:55:40.750 --> 01:55:42.270
<v Speaker 2>Oh Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She probably get out of here.</v>

2597
01:55:42.510 --> 01:55:46.620
<v Speaker 2>That did just by did you drive?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2598
01:55:46.890 --> 01:55:47.860
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone getting?</v>

<v Speaker 2>what's the best way?</v>

<v Speaker 2>terrified by it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had like a complete breakdown and</v>

2609
01:56:19.621 --> 01:56:23.670
<v Speaker 2>couldn't be on twitter for three days</v>

<v Speaker 2>went.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just nervous.</v>
