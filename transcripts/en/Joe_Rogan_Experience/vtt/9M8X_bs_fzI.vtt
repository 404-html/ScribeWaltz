1
00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:03.300
<v Speaker 1>Have you been here since he had a kid?</v>

2
00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:04.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was here last,</v>

3
00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:08.120
<v Speaker 2>right about four months after I didn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>sleep at all.</v>

4
00:00:08.121 --> 00:00:08.954
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was able to talk for and now your kid </v>

5
00:00:11.661 --> 00:00:13.550
<v Speaker 2>is how old?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thirteen months.</v>

6
00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:17.370
<v Speaker 2>Wait till they start talking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He.</v>

7
00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:18.280
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he says,</v>

8
00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:19.113
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's now his new thing is he says all </v>

9
00:00:21.561 --> 00:00:22.730
<v Speaker 2>done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all done.</v>

10
00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:23.863
<v Speaker 2>So he'll say it like he'll say it before</v>
<v Speaker 2>I change his diaper because he doesn't </v>

11
00:00:27.531 --> 00:00:29.210
<v Speaker 2>want me to go through that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>

12
00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:30.550
<v Speaker 2>Hold on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hold on.</v>

13
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:31.733
<v Speaker 2>Don't say it like a lane his crib and </v>
<v Speaker 2>say it like when he's ready to get out </v>

14
00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:36.570
<v Speaker 2>of bed early in the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like waiting.</v>

15
00:00:36.571 --> 00:00:37.760
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like maybe looking back to sleep</v>

16
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.960
<v Speaker 1>now being a scientist and having a </v>
<v Speaker 1>child.</v>

17
00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:43.243
<v Speaker 1>Are you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you like cognizant of like every </v>

18
00:00:46.911 --> 00:00:51.140
<v Speaker 1>single factor that's taking place like </v>
<v Speaker 1>nutrition,</v>

19
00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:56.950
<v Speaker 1>all the input,</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotional input environment must be kind</v>

20
00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:58.623
<v Speaker 1>of mind blowing</v>

21
00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.340
<v Speaker 2>and mind exhausting too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes it is.</v>

22
00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:03.700
<v Speaker 2>I'll give you an example right now </v>
<v Speaker 2>because we're traveling,</v>

23
00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:05.430
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

24
00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:06.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

25
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.840
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty this the BPA plastic bottles,</v>

26
00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:10.273
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm having to give him water and he's </v>

27
00:01:12.461 --> 00:01:15.530
<v Speaker 2>like obsessed for whatever reason.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's obsessed with drinking.</v>

28
00:01:15.531 --> 00:01:17.240
<v Speaker 2>I brought his like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

29
00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.000
<v Speaker 2>nice cop,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he doesn't wanna drink it out of his</v>

30
00:01:20.001 --> 00:01:20.781
<v Speaker 2>cup,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he wants to drink it,</v>

31
00:01:20.781 --> 00:01:21.614
<v Speaker 2>all these plastic bottles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's novel and crinkly sound and </v>

32
00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:25.210
<v Speaker 2>anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

33
00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.440
<v Speaker 2>so I'm like all I can think about is the</v>
<v Speaker 2>VPA and you know,</v>

34
00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:30.703
<v Speaker 2>am I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>am I exposing them to too much and </v>

35
00:01:32.001 --> 00:01:33.980
<v Speaker 2>what's it doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And is that BPA,</v>

36
00:01:33.981 --> 00:01:36.710
<v Speaker 2>is it leach only when it gets hot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that how it works?</v>

37
00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:37.603
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's another thing I was thinking </v>

38
00:01:38.391 --> 00:01:41.900
<v Speaker 2>about in my hotel today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>making a coffee with one of those,</v>

39
00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.920
<v Speaker 2>I'm one of those paper cups.</v>

40
00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.650
<v Speaker 2>It has the plastic lining and like I </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't know what's in the plastic lining,</v>

41
00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:49.513
<v Speaker 2>bpa or some of the BPA alternatives,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which have also been shown to how does </v>

42
00:01:52.221 --> 00:01:57.221
<v Speaker 2>bpa stands for Bisphenol a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So to answer your question,</v>

43
00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:00.990
<v Speaker 2>there's been experiments done that have </v>
<v Speaker 2>shown here.</v>

44
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:01.833
<v Speaker 2>So boiling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>boiling water and putting it in plastic </v>

45
00:02:04.011 --> 00:02:09.011
<v Speaker 2>increases the BPA that leeches into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>solution into the water by like 55 fold.</v>

46
00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:11.173
<v Speaker 2>So yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>definitely heating up it was like way </v>

47
00:02:13.341 --> 00:02:14.174
<v Speaker 2>worse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so one of the things I'm always now </v>

48
00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:16.790
<v Speaker 2>thinking about is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

49
00:02:16.791 --> 00:02:17.624
<v Speaker 2>going to starbucks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever the plastic lining they're </v>

50
00:02:19.941 --> 00:02:22.640
<v Speaker 2>putting in those cups when you get your </v>
<v Speaker 2>hot tea or your coffee.</v>

51
00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:24.273
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if there's BPA,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's now studies that have come </v>

52
00:02:26.901 --> 00:02:27.734
<v Speaker 2>out in these studies have been done in </v>
<v Speaker 2>animals that show like bps and some of </v>

53
00:02:30.951 --> 00:02:31.784
<v Speaker 2>the other bp of replacements also have </v>
<v Speaker 2>negative consequences on the endocrine </v>

54
00:02:35.811 --> 00:02:37.970
<v Speaker 2>system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on reproduction and some,</v>

55
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
<v Speaker 2>in some cases they're passed onto </v>
<v Speaker 2>multiple generations now.</v>

56
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.070
<v Speaker 2>How much of that is actually translates </v>
<v Speaker 2>to humans?</v>

57
00:02:43.071 --> 00:02:45.920
<v Speaker 2>It's unknown,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there have been studies,</v>

58
00:02:45.921 --> 00:02:47.940
<v Speaker 2>at least with Bpa that have shown that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

59
00:02:47.941 --> 00:02:48.774
<v Speaker 2>you give a person a single dose of BPA </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it disrupts their insulin </v>

60
00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:57.070
<v Speaker 2>sensitivity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It also plays a role in like I'm causing</v>

61
00:02:57.321 --> 00:02:58.154
<v Speaker 2>problems with in vitro fertilization,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so disrupting hormones and things like </v>

62
00:03:01.421 --> 00:03:02.254
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was really cognizant about it </v>

63
00:03:04.511 --> 00:03:06.340
<v Speaker 2>during pregnancy because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

64
00:03:06.341 --> 00:03:11.341
<v Speaker 2>typically we do detoxify,</v>
<v Speaker 2>detoxify it quite well.</v>

65
00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:16.660
<v Speaker 2>The half life is like less than five </v>
<v Speaker 2>hours and we excrete it through urine.</v>

66
00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:18.580
<v Speaker 2>It also comes out through sweat by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>

67
00:03:18.581 --> 00:03:20.140
<v Speaker 2>which is really good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

68
00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:21.940
<v Speaker 2>but pregnant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

69
00:03:21.941 --> 00:03:23.530
<v Speaker 2>when you're pregnant for whatever </v>
<v Speaker 2>reason,</v>

70
00:03:23.531 --> 00:03:25.300
<v Speaker 2>the placenta,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

71
00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:26.140
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

72
00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.340
<v Speaker 2>you're basically take the BPA your body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's in your body and your,</v>

73
00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:34.360
<v Speaker 2>your liver will inactivate it to this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like more benign compound.</v>

74
00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.470
<v Speaker 2>But when it crosses over the placenta,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it gets in,</v>

75
00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:38.320
<v Speaker 2>it gets activated again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it's like,</v>

76
00:03:38.321 --> 00:03:39.154
<v Speaker 2>that's why they effects are much more </v>
<v Speaker 2>robust always on like the developing </v>

77
00:03:42.131 --> 00:03:44.530
<v Speaker 2>fetus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I was really made sure I was like</v>

78
00:03:44.531 --> 00:03:47.830
<v Speaker 2>not drinking anything out of a plastic </v>
<v Speaker 2>bottle or anything like that,</v>

79
00:03:47.831 --> 00:03:48.730
<v Speaker 2>don't when I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>while I was pregnant,</v>

80
00:03:48.731 --> 00:03:49.810
<v Speaker 2>just because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

81
00:03:49.811 --> 00:03:51.510
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

82
00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:52.473
<v Speaker 2>At the end of the day there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of studies that have been </v>

83
00:03:53.771 --> 00:03:55.750
<v Speaker 2>done in animals and just how much of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

84
00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:57.760
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>translate how significant is.</v>

85
00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:59.760
<v Speaker 2>It's really hard to say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

86
00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:02.410
<v Speaker 2>but it certainly concerned</v>

87
00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:04.090
<v Speaker 1>it was probably a compounding effect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

88
00:04:04.091 --> 00:04:05.740
<v Speaker 1>with all the other environmental </v>
<v Speaker 1>factors,</v>

89
00:04:05.741 --> 00:04:07.840
<v Speaker 1>pollution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particulates in the air,</v>

90
00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:11.260
<v Speaker 1>chemicals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the other jazz that we take into our</v>

91
00:04:11.261 --> 00:04:12.130
<v Speaker 1>body all the time.</v>

92
00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:13.580
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

93
00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.190
<v Speaker 2>And then the fact that actually aging </v>
<v Speaker 2>bottles,</v>

94
00:04:16.191 --> 00:04:17.900
<v Speaker 2>like as you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for whatever reason,</v>

95
00:04:17.901 --> 00:04:19.550
<v Speaker 2>as a bottle sits,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if you keep using,</v>

96
00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.950
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the study was done with baby bottles,</v>

97
00:04:21.951 --> 00:04:22.784
<v Speaker 2>if you keep using a baby bottle and </v>
<v Speaker 2>putting liquid in as the bottle aged </v>

98
00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:28.790
<v Speaker 2>more BPA was leeched out into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>liquid.</v>

99
00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.830
<v Speaker 2>So for whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know it's just.</v>

100
00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.650
<v Speaker 2>So it's another thing I'm thinking about</v>
<v Speaker 2>with all my son's stuff.</v>

101
00:04:33.651 --> 00:04:36.020
<v Speaker 2>It's like everything's plastic and he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>chewing on.</v>

102
00:04:36.021 --> 00:04:36.970
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

103
00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:39.620
<v Speaker 2>at some point you just can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like there's,</v>

104
00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:41.240
<v Speaker 2>you can't control everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

105
00:04:41.241 --> 00:04:44.000
<v Speaker 2>How many kids do you think you're going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to have right now?</v>

106
00:04:44.001 --> 00:04:44.834
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one is,</v>

107
00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:45.763
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am so satisfied and full of so much </v>

108
00:04:48.231 --> 00:04:50.750
<v Speaker 2>joy and it's a lot of work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

109
00:04:50.751 --> 00:04:51.291
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

110
00:04:51.291 --> 00:04:52.340
<v Speaker 2>he's 13 months,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I've,</v>

111
00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.050
<v Speaker 2>I've only had them a little bit over a </v>
<v Speaker 2>year.</v>

112
00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:58.040
<v Speaker 2>So right now I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm really happy with him being special.</v>

113
00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:02.930
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's likely that maybe one,</v>

114
00:05:02.931 --> 00:05:04.370
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not gonna like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

115
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.760
<v Speaker 2>say for sure it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a lot of work.</v>

116
00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:08.810
<v Speaker 2>It's a lot of work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

117
00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:11.660
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just adding another,</v>

118
00:05:11.661 --> 00:05:12.170
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

119
00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:15.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've put a lot of energy and time,</v>

120
00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:16.793
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>spent a lot of time with him doing lots </v>

121
00:05:18.141 --> 00:05:20.630
<v Speaker 2>of things and of course all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>nutrition and all that.</v>

122
00:05:20.631 --> 00:05:21.890
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>

123
00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:23.770
<v Speaker 2>How do you do that with too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

124
00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:27.300
<v Speaker 1>it's very satisfying though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Watching them play with their siblings.</v>

125
00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:29.820
<v Speaker 1>It's really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like my two youngest,</v>

126
00:05:29.821 --> 00:05:32.970
<v Speaker 1>my eight and my 10,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like watching them play together,</v>

127
00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:33.853
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's adorable watching them hold hands </v>

128
00:05:35.401 --> 00:05:38.100
<v Speaker 1>and do stuff together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's really fun.</v>

129
00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:40.800
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they developed a very unique bond.</v>

130
00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:44.100
<v Speaker 1>They fight all the time over nothing </v>
<v Speaker 1>like Gimme that it's mine.</v>

131
00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:46.410
<v Speaker 1>It's my like in all of a sudden like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoa,</v>

132
00:05:46.411 --> 00:05:47.011
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>

133
00:05:47.011 --> 00:05:48.540
<v Speaker 1>What happened?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

134
00:05:48.541 --> 00:05:49.374
<v Speaker 1>like there's always like some blow up </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they have zero control of their </v>

135
00:05:51.841 --> 00:05:53.640
<v Speaker 1>emotions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anything that goes on,</v>

136
00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:58.250
<v Speaker 2>it's just a flood gate is either on</v>

137
00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:01.640
<v Speaker 1>or it's off and but they're really good </v>
<v Speaker 1>at apologizing too,</v>

138
00:06:01.641 --> 00:06:03.620
<v Speaker 1>which is really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've taught them how to do that.</v>

139
00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:04.970
<v Speaker 1>How to just say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

140
00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:06.950
<v Speaker 1>everybody gets emotional.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's okay,</v>

141
00:06:06.951 --> 00:06:08.670
<v Speaker 1>apologize and hug it out and</v>

142
00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:09.663
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's also another thing that is </v>

143
00:06:11.501 --> 00:06:13.960
<v Speaker 2>really important in the teaching or your</v>
<v Speaker 2>children how to be happy.</v>

144
00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:16.870
<v Speaker 2>Like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause that's important.</v>

145
00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:19.150
<v Speaker 1>They see that though they'll see that </v>
<v Speaker 1>new,</v>

146
00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:21.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the imitate their environment.</v>

147
00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:22.300
<v Speaker 1>If they see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

148
00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:23.423
<v Speaker 1>that you know how to be happy and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can turn things around and you not </v>

149
00:06:26.381 --> 00:06:29.590
<v Speaker 1>to make light of situations and they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll,</v>

150
00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:31.720
<v Speaker 1>they take on these behavior patterns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really,</v>

151
00:06:31.721 --> 00:06:34.480
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the more fascinating </v>
<v Speaker 1>things is watching kids go,</v>

152
00:06:34.481 --> 00:06:36.070
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you going to do?</v>

153
00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:37.240
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when you do,</v>

154
00:06:37.241 --> 00:06:38.970
<v Speaker 1>what are you going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you see them go on,</v>

155
00:06:38.971 --> 00:06:40.150
<v Speaker 1>Huh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you going to do?</v>

156
00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:41.740
<v Speaker 1>And you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>

157
00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:44.140
<v Speaker 1>Watching an eight year old figured that </v>
<v Speaker 1>out was kind of cool.</v>

158
00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:45.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's nice.</v>

159
00:06:45.111 --> 00:06:46.760
<v Speaker 2>That's nice to know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like right now,</v>

160
00:06:46.761 --> 00:06:49.280
<v Speaker 2>my son,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's almost always just happy,</v>

161
00:06:49.281 --> 00:06:50.114
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm thinking about like future he's </v>

162
00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:57.680
<v Speaker 2>going to girl problems and girl breaks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just anything,</v>

163
00:06:57.861 --> 00:06:58.760
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where it's the thought,</v>

164
00:06:58.761 --> 00:07:00.110
<v Speaker 2>well if he's gay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

165
00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:02.250
<v Speaker 2>And that's where I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

166
00:07:02.251 --> 00:07:06.100
<v Speaker 2>all the endocrine disruptors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>

167
00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:08.430
<v Speaker 2>I'm gay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

168
00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:09.450
<v Speaker 2>Who knows,</v>

169
00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:11.030
<v Speaker 1>who knows what's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

170
00:07:11.031 --> 00:07:13.090
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what's,</v>

171
00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:13.963
<v Speaker 1>what's of major concern to me is living </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a major metropolitan areas with the </v>

172
00:07:19.291 --> 00:07:20.124
<v Speaker 1>constant pollution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was reading a study that was </v>

173
00:07:22.591 --> 00:07:27.591
<v Speaker 1>talking about living in any major </v>
<v Speaker 1>metropolitan area like New York City can</v>

174
00:07:27.691 --> 00:07:31.080
<v Speaker 1>take many years off of your life just </v>
<v Speaker 1>from living there.</v>

175
00:07:31.081 --> 00:07:32.220
<v Speaker 1>It will shorten your life.</v>

176
00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:33.783
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been reading multiple studies over </v>

177
00:07:34.661 --> 00:07:37.600
<v Speaker 2>the years about air pollution and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

178
00:07:37.601 --> 00:07:38.434
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's compounds in air pollution that </v>

179
00:07:39.761 --> 00:07:40.594
<v Speaker 2>are carcinogens like benzine and there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>also the particulate matter and how </v>

180
00:07:43.961 --> 00:07:44.920
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

181
00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:46.980
<v Speaker 2>how air pollution is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

182
00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:49.390
<v Speaker 2>increasing the risk for stroke,</v>
<v Speaker 2>heart attack,</v>

183
00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:51.300
<v Speaker 2>Alzheimer's disease.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

184
00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:52.173
<v Speaker 2>and this is like in dose dependent </v>
<v Speaker 2>manners and of course has all sorts of </v>

185
00:07:54.461 --> 00:07:57.190
<v Speaker 2>confounding factors and you can never </v>
<v Speaker 2>really show causality,</v>

186
00:07:57.191 --> 00:08:00.220
<v Speaker 2>although some animal studies have been </v>
<v Speaker 2>showing causality.</v>

187
00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:01.780
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

188
00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:02.653
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and some of these things are really bad </v>

189
00:08:03.731 --> 00:08:08.731
<v Speaker 2>in developing nations that don't have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of regulatory regulations on,</v>

190
00:08:09.090 --> 00:08:09.911
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

191
00:08:09.911 --> 00:08:10.744
<v Speaker 2>like automobile exhaust and so some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some developing countries have like </v>

192
00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:16.150
<v Speaker 2>children coming down with strokes and </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff like early,</v>

193
00:08:16.151 --> 00:08:18.910
<v Speaker 2>like young teenage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

194
00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:19.803
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's been,</v>

195
00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:22.030
<v Speaker 2>this has of course been linked to air </v>
<v Speaker 2>pollution.</v>

196
00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:23.380
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's,</v>

197
00:08:23.410 --> 00:08:24.243
<v Speaker 2>it's definitely a concern and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's all sorts of studies talking </v>

198
00:08:26.741 --> 00:08:27.574
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

199
00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:29.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course asthma,</v>

200
00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:31.550
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>happiness and,</v>

201
00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:33.910
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and bring function and all that,</v>

202
00:08:33.911 --> 00:08:35.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

203
00:08:35.231 --> 00:08:36.064
<v Speaker 2>and it's something like I live off of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>busy road and then there's noise </v>

204
00:08:38.531 --> 00:08:40.060
<v Speaker 2>pollution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is another.</v>

205
00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:41.133
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's like something that I've been </v>

206
00:08:43.571 --> 00:08:44.404
<v Speaker 2>like really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really aware of and trying to like move </v>

207
00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:51.910
<v Speaker 2>out away from a busy traffic areas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly for my son,</v>

208
00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:53.233
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I'm just very concerned about </v>

209
00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:55.770
<v Speaker 2>the health risks.</v>

210
00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:56.873
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wonder also the in the impact of just </v>

211
00:08:59.821 --> 00:09:00.654
<v Speaker 3>being in an urban environment and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fact that it's not really natural and </v>

212
00:09:03.751 --> 00:09:04.584
<v Speaker 3>that may be a person who's an adult </v>
<v Speaker 3>could enjoy living in Manhattan and </v>

213
00:09:08.581 --> 00:09:11.190
<v Speaker 3>decide that they get a thrill out of </v>
<v Speaker 3>living in the city,</v>

214
00:09:11.191 --> 00:09:12.024
<v Speaker 3>but for a baby to grow up around all </v>
<v Speaker 3>that concrete and glass and all these </v>

215
00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:17.123
<v Speaker 3>sharp hard edges and right angles that </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's maybe not conducive to healthy </v>

216
00:09:23.041 --> 00:09:25.710
<v Speaker 3>brain development or that's not like </v>
<v Speaker 3>what your,</v>

217
00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:26.903
<v Speaker 3>what your body or your brain is </v>
<v Speaker 3>naturally craving and there's been </v>

218
00:09:29.371 --> 00:09:30.540
<v Speaker 3>studies looking at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

219
00:09:30.541 --> 00:09:31.374
<v Speaker 3>like people that exercise and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>metropolitan area versus like out in </v>

220
00:09:34.921 --> 00:09:38.100
<v Speaker 3>like a park nature and that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

221
00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:43.230
<v Speaker 3>all sorts of measurements of depressive </v>
<v Speaker 3>symptoms that are measured after and the</v>

222
00:09:43.231 --> 00:09:46.350
<v Speaker 3>ones that measured or that nature or </v>
<v Speaker 3>run.</v>

223
00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:49.020
<v Speaker 3>We're far better at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

224
00:09:49.021 --> 00:09:51.630
<v Speaker 3>basically feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>feeling happier after after their run.</v>

225
00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:53.280
<v Speaker 3>Then the people that didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>metropolitan city.</v>

226
00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:54.260
<v Speaker 3>Does that make sense?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

227
00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:55.403
<v Speaker 3>I mean I think that's why people like </v>
<v Speaker 3>central park in New York City was just </v>

228
00:09:58.320 --> 00:09:59.790
<v Speaker 3>say in a way asis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

229
00:09:59.791 --> 00:10:00.720
<v Speaker 3>You get something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

230
00:10:00.721 --> 00:10:03.630
<v Speaker 3>it's really a great place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really quite big.</v>

231
00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:05.880
<v Speaker 3>One of the things about central park </v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're in it,</v>

232
00:10:05.881 --> 00:10:06.714
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

233
00:10:06.830 --> 00:10:08.790
<v Speaker 3>this is weird that this is in the middle</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the city,</v>

234
00:10:08.791 --> 00:10:11.380
<v Speaker 3>but it's a brilliant move to have this </v>
<v Speaker 3>one area.</v>

235
00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:12.233
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you think about how much that real </v>

236
00:10:13.441 --> 00:10:14.274
<v Speaker 3>estate would be worth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just said just to shove buildings in </v>

237
00:10:16.351 --> 00:10:17.184
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean Manhattan is one of the most </v>

238
00:10:19.201 --> 00:10:20.034
<v Speaker 3>pricey real estate places on the planet </v>
<v Speaker 3>earth and yet in the middle of it they </v>

239
00:10:23.851 --> 00:10:28.780
<v Speaker 3>have this big open public park area that</v>
<v Speaker 3>anyone could just wander around,</v>

240
00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:31.190
<v Speaker 3>sit by a tree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really a very,</v>

241
00:10:31.191 --> 00:10:33.130
<v Speaker 3>very smart move.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is,</v>

242
00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:33.480
<v Speaker 3>it is.</v>

243
00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:35.520
<v Speaker 3>Nice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>La should have something like that.</v>

244
00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:36.773
<v Speaker 3>Is the air pollution.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you know if the air pollution with </v>

245
00:10:37.941 --> 00:10:39.840
<v Speaker 3>like in Manhattan?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's terrible,</v>

246
00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:43.860
<v Speaker 3>terrible in Manhattan to La.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they're probably equally sucky,</v>

247
00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:47.190
<v Speaker 3>but the thing that is bothering me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

248
00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:48.193
<v Speaker 3>is not just the air pollution in terms </v>
<v Speaker 3>of like the exhaust fumes and exhaust </v>

249
00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:56.850
<v Speaker 3>the smells,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but also the brake dust.</v>

250
00:10:57.210 --> 00:10:59.520
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I first started paying attention to</v>

251
00:10:59.521 --> 00:11:03.150
<v Speaker 3>brake dust and I would always clean it </v>
<v Speaker 3>off my wheels,</v>

252
00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:04.920
<v Speaker 3>but I would never think about it like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

253
00:11:04.921 --> 00:11:07.390
<v Speaker 3>there's dust that's on my wheels.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say,</v>

254
00:11:07.391 --> 00:11:08.061
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just dust.</v>

255
00:11:08.061 --> 00:11:08.894
<v Speaker 3>And he was then someone was explaining </v>
<v Speaker 3>to me to know that's an environmental </v>

256
00:11:11.371 --> 00:11:14.220
<v Speaker 3>hazard that you're breathing in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you live in that environment,</v>

257
00:11:14.221 --> 00:11:15.054
<v Speaker 3>when you're around,</v>
<v Speaker 3>know if you're on Broadway and cars are </v>

258
00:11:17.101 --> 00:11:18.960
<v Speaker 3>constantly hitting their breaks around </v>
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

259
00:11:18.961 --> 00:11:23.130
<v Speaker 3>There's a puff of that brake dust has </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting in the air with every pump,</v>

260
00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:24.083
<v Speaker 3>the brakes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you're just taking that disgusting </v>

261
00:11:26.491 --> 00:11:27.840
<v Speaker 3>stuff into your lungs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

262
00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:28.713
<v Speaker 3>That particulate matter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's really tiny and stuff because </v>

263
00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:33.720
<v Speaker 3>that's like Mesothelioma,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

264
00:11:33.721 --> 00:11:36.050
<v Speaker 3>You're taking in the particulate matter </v>
<v Speaker 3>from his bestest.</v>

265
00:11:36.610 --> 00:11:39.840
<v Speaker 3>So in the same you'd think there'd be </v>
<v Speaker 3>similar mechanisms may not going to lead</v>

266
00:11:39.841 --> 00:11:41.010
<v Speaker 3>to immediate family,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oma,</v>

267
00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:44.420
<v Speaker 3>but that there would be similar </v>
<v Speaker 3>mechanisms at play that are like,</v>

268
00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:46.710
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>damaging organs.</v>

269
00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:49.020
<v Speaker 3>Good to visit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not good to stay.</v>

270
00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:50.730
<v Speaker 3>That's what I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

271
00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:52.290
<v Speaker 3>my.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have no desire.</v>

272
00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:53.650
<v Speaker 3>I don't even like living here.</v>

273
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:56.500
<v Speaker 2>I think there's too many people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

274
00:11:56.501 --> 00:11:58.210
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I definitely don't like driving here,</v>

275
00:11:58.270 --> 00:11:59.103
<v Speaker 2>like it's like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really bad how much is the </v>

276
00:12:02.171 --> 00:12:03.910
<v Speaker 2>difference between here and we're in San</v>
<v Speaker 2>Diego.</v>

277
00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:08.120
<v Speaker 2>San Diego is definitely bad during um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

278
00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:10.420
<v Speaker 2>the typical times people are either </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to work or coming,</v>

279
00:12:10.510 --> 00:12:12.070
<v Speaker 2>coming home from work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

280
00:12:12.250 --> 00:12:13.790
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

281
00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:14.653
<v Speaker 2>it's nothing like La.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean la is orders of magnitude worse </v>

282
00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:20.440
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're not doing clinical research,</v>

283
00:12:21.010 --> 00:12:23.290
<v Speaker 2>you could do a lot of your stuff </v>
<v Speaker 2>somewhere else.</v>

284
00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:24.730
<v Speaker 2>Have you thought about being somewhere </v>
<v Speaker 2>else?</v>

285
00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.600
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so my family's in San Diego and uh,</v>

286
00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:30.543
<v Speaker 2>it's really nice having my mom in </v>
<v Speaker 2>particular because she helps out a lot </v>

287
00:12:33.311 --> 00:12:35.860
<v Speaker 2>with my son so that I can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

288
00:12:36.010 --> 00:12:39.520
<v Speaker 2>get some work done too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is important and I really,</v>

289
00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:40.720
<v Speaker 2>we could live,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

290
00:12:40.721 --> 00:12:42.610
<v Speaker 2>a little bit further out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's,</v>

291
00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:46.050
<v Speaker 2>there are places like that are still </v>
<v Speaker 2>within like 40 minute drive to like,</v>

292
00:12:46.460 --> 00:12:47.293
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>downtown San Diego beaches and stuff </v>

293
00:12:49.661 --> 00:12:50.740
<v Speaker 2>that are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are nice.</v>

294
00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:51.573
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that is something that we are </v>

295
00:12:53.381 --> 00:12:56.050
<v Speaker 2>considering buying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're just a little quieter,</v>

296
00:12:56.230 --> 00:12:58.300
<v Speaker 2>definitely quieter no matter what it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to be.</v>

297
00:12:58.301 --> 00:12:59.470
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because we live,</v>

298
00:12:59.510 --> 00:13:02.950
<v Speaker 2>there's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a busy road and there's fire sirens</v>

299
00:13:02.951 --> 00:13:05.230
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my son likes the fire sirens,</v>

300
00:13:05.231 --> 00:13:06.064
<v Speaker 2>but there are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there have been times when there have </v>

301
00:13:06.791 --> 00:13:09.860
<v Speaker 2>been loud motorcycles and he is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>concerned,</v>

302
00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:11.770
<v Speaker 2>like you can see a look on it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it's,</v>

303
00:13:11.771 --> 00:13:12.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

304
00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:15.780
<v Speaker 2>so it kind of worries me as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

305
00:13:15.910 --> 00:13:18.680
<v Speaker 2>but definitely it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

306
00:13:18.681 --> 00:13:18.980
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

307
00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:22.000
<v Speaker 2>it's important to get away from that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a goal for sure.</v>

308
00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:24.250
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>before the podcast started,</v>

309
00:13:24.251 --> 00:13:29.251
<v Speaker 2>you were telling me that you wrote a 30 </v>
<v Speaker 2>page paper on the Carnivore Diet.</v>

310
00:13:31.090 --> 00:13:32.330
<v Speaker 2>It's not a paper.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

311
00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:34.850
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I definitely spent a lot of time pages.</v>

312
00:13:34.890 --> 00:13:37.420
<v Speaker 2>I thought about it for a long time and </v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

313
00:13:37.421 --> 00:13:40.660
<v Speaker 2>there's 30 pages of thoughts and </v>
<v Speaker 2>references.</v>

314
00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:42.340
<v Speaker 2>Were you stunned that this became,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

315
00:13:42.341 --> 00:13:45.060
<v Speaker 2>this is a very recent thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

316
00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:47.920
<v Speaker 2>People were just eating meat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

317
00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:49.190
<v Speaker 2>at first,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

318
00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:52.430
<v Speaker 2>when I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I think Dan told me about it like a</v>

319
00:13:52.490 --> 00:13:54.380
<v Speaker 2>couple of years ago even,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

320
00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:57.430
<v Speaker 2>and I thought there's no way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

321
00:13:57.460 --> 00:14:01.210
<v Speaker 2>I just ignored it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have time for that.</v>

322
00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:04.210
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I definitely,</v>

323
00:14:04.570 --> 00:14:08.890
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dismissed it when I,</v>

324
00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:09.813
<v Speaker 2>when I first heard about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's definitely been something that </v>

325
00:14:11.471 --> 00:14:16.070
<v Speaker 2>has gained a lot of traction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

326
00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:18.190
<v Speaker 2>send it disturb you that it's getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>traction.</v>

327
00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:20.380
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I definitely have concerns.</v>

328
00:14:20.490 --> 00:14:22.840
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that the,</v>

329
00:14:22.990 --> 00:14:27.990
<v Speaker 2>the most important question really is </v>
<v Speaker 2>what is attracting someone to try such a</v>

330
00:14:29.831 --> 00:14:33.730
<v Speaker 2>very restrictive diet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

331
00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:34.593
<v Speaker 2>that potentially could be dangerous </v>
<v Speaker 2>without published evidence or any sort </v>

332
00:14:39.011 --> 00:14:40.510
<v Speaker 2>of longterm studies and things like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

333
00:14:40.930 --> 00:14:42.820
<v Speaker 2>So I think that the first question </v>
<v Speaker 2>really is,</v>

334
00:14:42.821 --> 00:14:44.320
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why are people doing this?</v>

335
00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:48.640
<v Speaker 2>And so looking on the Internet and try </v>
<v Speaker 2>to like read about people's anecdotes.</v>

336
00:14:49.050 --> 00:14:49.883
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems as though a lot of people are </v>

337
00:14:51.441 --> 00:14:52.274
<v Speaker 2>drawn to it because they have some sort </v>
<v Speaker 2>of autoimmune problem and so they try </v>

338
00:14:56.751 --> 00:15:01.751
<v Speaker 2>this diet and it improves their </v>
<v Speaker 2>autoimmune symptoms and I see that seems</v>

339
00:15:02.451 --> 00:15:06.110
<v Speaker 2>to be a real common theme in at least if</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

340
00:15:06.111 --> 00:15:08.240
<v Speaker 2>if you look in the blogosphere ears and </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff like that.</v>

341
00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:09.920
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's,</v>

342
00:15:09.950 --> 00:15:12.830
<v Speaker 2>I think kind of a good place to start </v>
<v Speaker 2>where it's like,</v>

343
00:15:12.831 --> 00:15:13.960
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

344
00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:16.370
<v Speaker 2>what are people doing this for?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

345
00:15:16.910 --> 00:15:17.681
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's,</v>

346
00:15:17.681 --> 00:15:20.810
<v Speaker 2>that's kind of an important question and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm so,</v>

347
00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:25.870
<v Speaker 2>so further reading about this diet is </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of sort of think about,</v>

348
00:15:26.331 --> 00:15:26.691
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

349
00:15:26.691 --> 00:15:30.190
<v Speaker 2>well what's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really important when you have like</v>

350
00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:31.333
<v Speaker 2>something that leads to an effect to </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand the mechanism because the </v>

351
00:15:34.761 --> 00:15:38.060
<v Speaker 2>mechanism is what's leading to this </v>
<v Speaker 2>effect.</v>

352
00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:42.920
<v Speaker 2>And so if you can do something that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>potentially not so dangerous or risky,</v>

353
00:15:42.921 --> 00:15:45.620
<v Speaker 2>then understanding the mechanism will </v>
<v Speaker 2>help you because then you can find other</v>

354
00:15:45.621 --> 00:15:46.520
<v Speaker 2>ways to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

355
00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:47.893
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

356
00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:48.853
<v Speaker 2>if you look at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at a published studies on people that </v>

357
00:15:51.171 --> 00:15:53.030
<v Speaker 2>eat low carb,</v>
<v Speaker 2>high protein diets,</v>

358
00:15:53.790 --> 00:15:56.990
<v Speaker 2>which is pretty common,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that they're,</v>

359
00:15:57.800 --> 00:16:01.100
<v Speaker 2>there's changes that happen in a variety</v>
<v Speaker 2>of different endocrine factors.</v>

360
00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:01.953
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

361
00:16:02.030 --> 00:16:06.110
<v Speaker 2>you're less insulin that's changing your</v>
<v Speaker 2>satiety and hunger hormones,</v>

362
00:16:06.111 --> 00:16:06.944
<v Speaker 2>Leptin and Ghrelin and people become </v>
<v Speaker 2>more satiated and they actually eat </v>

363
00:16:09.441 --> 00:16:10.274
<v Speaker 2>less.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this has been shown in multiple </v>

364
00:16:12.261 --> 00:16:16.070
<v Speaker 2>studies so people actually eat less when</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're having a higher protein diet,</v>

365
00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:18.650
<v Speaker 2>which makes sense to because protein is </v>
<v Speaker 2>more satiating,</v>

366
00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:19.733
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as well.</v>

367
00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:21.313
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and also there's also been studies on </v>

368
00:16:24.291 --> 00:16:27.440
<v Speaker 2>what's called food habituation a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're basically,</v>

369
00:16:27.441 --> 00:16:30.170
<v Speaker 2>so habituation is when you're constantly</v>
<v Speaker 2>exposed to the same stimulus,</v>

370
00:16:30.171 --> 00:16:31.004
<v Speaker 2>you sort of have a decreased response to</v>
<v Speaker 2>that stimulus where there's been </v>

371
00:16:33.501 --> 00:16:37.250
<v Speaker 2>intervention trials where people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>given the same food every single day,</v>

372
00:16:37.310 --> 00:16:41.900
<v Speaker 2>both non obese and obese people versus </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that are given the same food once</v>

373
00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:42.110
<v Speaker 2>a week.</v>

374
00:16:42.110 --> 00:16:45.890
<v Speaker 2>And the people that are given the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>food every single day that they start to</v>

375
00:16:45.891 --> 00:16:48.800
<v Speaker 2>eat less calories so they start to eat </v>
<v Speaker 2>less.</v>

376
00:16:49.010 --> 00:16:51.620
<v Speaker 2>I'm naturally started to calorie </v>
<v Speaker 2>restrict themselves.</v>

377
00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:53.270
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I mean,</v>

378
00:16:53.290 --> 00:16:54.123
<v Speaker 2>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's Kinda like a dietary monotony sort </v>

379
00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:58.500
<v Speaker 2>of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think there are any,</v>

380
00:16:58.650 --> 00:17:01.580
<v Speaker 2>if you read and the people out there on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the blogs talking about this diet,</v>

381
00:17:01.581 --> 00:17:04.070
<v Speaker 2>they say I like I'm eating less,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I only eat twice a day.</v>

382
00:17:04.071 --> 00:17:05.430
<v Speaker 2>I'm fasting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's,</v>

383
00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:09.560
<v Speaker 2>people are talking about that as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think there's published evidence to</v>

384
00:17:09.561 --> 00:17:11.630
<v Speaker 2>kind of explain that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And also there's,</v>

385
00:17:11.631 --> 00:17:12.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people saying,</v>

386
00:17:12.741 --> 00:17:13.574
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I eat less.</v>

387
00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:15.133
<v Speaker 2>So that's an important point because one</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing that's really known to affect </v>

388
00:17:19.850 --> 00:17:22.130
<v Speaker 2>autoimmunity is caloric restriction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And fasting,</v>

389
00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:25.340
<v Speaker 2>like it's probably one of the most well </v>
<v Speaker 2>known,</v>

390
00:17:25.450 --> 00:17:26.283
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>technologies that you can intervene and </v>

391
00:17:28.851 --> 00:17:30.470
<v Speaker 2>have improvements in autoimmune disease.</v>

392
00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:31.783
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

393
00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:32.653
<v Speaker 2>some of that has to do with the fact </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you can sort of reset your immune </v>

394
00:17:34.731 --> 00:17:37.160
<v Speaker 2>system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There have been animal studies and human</v>

395
00:17:37.161 --> 00:17:39.290
<v Speaker 2>studies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of this done by Dr Valter Longo at</v>

396
00:17:39.291 --> 00:17:40.560
<v Speaker 2>USC.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

397
00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:44.570
<v Speaker 2>he's done some prolonged fasting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm in animals.</v>

398
00:17:44.571 --> 00:17:47.960
<v Speaker 2>And also there's been sort of like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>fasting mimicking diet done in humans,</v>

399
00:17:47.961 --> 00:17:52.230
<v Speaker 2>which kind of a very low calorie diet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is meant to mimic fast.</v>

400
00:17:52.820 --> 00:17:54.780
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and those have shown that,</v>

401
00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:56.533
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you basically kind of crossover because </v>

402
00:17:59.941 --> 00:18:04.080
<v Speaker 2>fasting is a type of stress you </v>
<v Speaker 2>crossover into this like stronger stress</v>

403
00:18:04.081 --> 00:18:04.914
<v Speaker 2>response where you're not only like </v>
<v Speaker 2>cleaning away all the gunk in the size </v>

404
00:18:07.531 --> 00:18:08.880
<v Speaker 2>of the cells.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People talk about a topic,</v>

405
00:18:08.890 --> 00:18:10.500
<v Speaker 2>you lot when they're talking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>fasting,</v>

406
00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:14.130
<v Speaker 2>you clean away things like damaged piece</v>
<v Speaker 2>of DNA,</v>

407
00:18:14.131 --> 00:18:15.690
<v Speaker 2>protein aggregates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things like that.</v>

408
00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:18.150
<v Speaker 2>Mitochondria that are damaged get </v>
<v Speaker 2>cleared out.</v>

409
00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:19.463
<v Speaker 2>But you also sort of start to clear away</v>
<v Speaker 2>entire cells through a process called </v>

410
00:18:23.161 --> 00:18:25.620
<v Speaker 2>apoptosis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in animal studies,</v>

411
00:18:25.621 --> 00:18:27.600
<v Speaker 2>what's been shown is that if you do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

412
00:18:27.601 --> 00:18:28.434
<v Speaker 2>a 72 hour fast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can clear away about 30 percent of </v>

413
00:18:31.111 --> 00:18:33.660
<v Speaker 2>the immune system and that and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

414
00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:34.553
<v Speaker 2>and we replenish it with like brand new </v>
<v Speaker 2>healthy immune cells and literally like </v>

415
00:18:38.221 --> 00:18:39.054
<v Speaker 2>Oregon's shrink once during the fasting </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then they have like re-expand </v>

416
00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:44.160
<v Speaker 2>because you're activating the stem cells</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're,</v>

417
00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:45.030
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

418
00:18:45.030 --> 00:18:48.900
<v Speaker 2>basically replenishing all your damaged </v>
<v Speaker 2>old cells with new ones.</v>

419
00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:50.213
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>will voltaren as shown in animal </v>

420
00:18:51.991 --> 00:18:52.980
<v Speaker 2>studies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Also,</v>

421
00:18:52.981 --> 00:18:53.814
<v Speaker 2>auto immune cells tend to be selectively</v>
<v Speaker 2>killed off and replaced with non on </v>

422
00:18:59.011 --> 00:19:01.770
<v Speaker 2>immune cells.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he's also done a clinical study,</v>

423
00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:02.653
<v Speaker 2>a pilot clinical study with people with </v>
<v Speaker 2>multiple sclerosis during this fast </v>

424
00:19:04.951 --> 00:19:07.140
<v Speaker 2>mimicking diet for one month,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sorry for one week.</v>

425
00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:10.350
<v Speaker 2>And I'm there in their symptoms </v>
<v Speaker 2>improved.</v>

426
00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:12.630
<v Speaker 2>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a ketogenic diet was done side by side.</v>

427
00:19:12.631 --> 00:19:15.000
<v Speaker 2>And ketogenic Diet also improve symptoms</v>
<v Speaker 2>of autoimmunity.</v>

428
00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:18.210
<v Speaker 2>So those both were done in humans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think that,</v>

429
00:19:18.270 --> 00:19:19.530
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

430
00:19:19.531 --> 00:19:20.364
<v Speaker 2>understanding that some of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>mechanisms that are at play and that </v>

431
00:19:23.431 --> 00:19:24.264
<v Speaker 2>fasting itself and caloric restriction </v>
<v Speaker 2>both have been shown to improve </v>

432
00:19:26.371 --> 00:19:27.204
<v Speaker 2>autoimmunity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You may be tapping into something there </v>

433
00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:30.720
<v Speaker 2>by eating less.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one possibility.</v>

434
00:19:31.290 --> 00:19:32.850
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in addition,</v>

435
00:19:32.970 --> 00:19:33.803
<v Speaker 2>there's been studies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>clinical studies in humans were that </v>

436
00:19:35.481 --> 00:19:36.314
<v Speaker 2>were done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were basically fasted for 24 hours </v>

437
00:19:39.811 --> 00:19:40.644
<v Speaker 2>every other day for 15 days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they had like a total of seven days </v>

438
00:19:42.601 --> 00:19:46.800
<v Speaker 2>of fasting and these were also people </v>
<v Speaker 2>with multiple sclerosis.</v>

439
00:19:47.310 --> 00:19:51.240
<v Speaker 2>And there's profound changes in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>microbiome that started happening.</v>

440
00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:56.580
<v Speaker 2>And this was an in line with basically </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm having,</v>

441
00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:57.473
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of anti inflammatory cytokines </v>

442
00:19:59.100 --> 00:19:59.933
<v Speaker 2>basically producing immune cells that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are really important for preventing </v>

443
00:20:04.051 --> 00:20:05.610
<v Speaker 2>autoimmunity called t regulatory cells.</v>

444
00:20:05.610 --> 00:20:08.580
<v Speaker 2>So things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's another really important thing</v>

445
00:20:08.581 --> 00:20:10.380
<v Speaker 2>to consider is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

446
00:20:10.381 --> 00:20:11.214
<v Speaker 2>the microbiome because the microbiome </v>
<v Speaker 2>has been linked to autoimmunity and </v>

447
00:20:14.971 --> 00:20:16.590
<v Speaker 2>multiple,</v>
<v Speaker 2>multiple studies.</v>

448
00:20:16.650 --> 00:20:18.360
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's been linked to arthritis.</v>

449
00:20:18.361 --> 00:20:19.194
<v Speaker 2>It's been linked to multiple sclerosis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's been linked to other diseases like </v>

450
00:20:21.001 --> 00:20:23.340
<v Speaker 2>Parkinson's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is not really autoimmune.</v>

451
00:20:23.341 --> 00:20:24.550
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

452
00:20:24.810 --> 00:20:26.970
<v Speaker 2>and the point of this is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

453
00:20:26.971 --> 00:20:28.950
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>understanding mechanism and realizing,</v>

454
00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:30.263
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's other potential factors that </v>

455
00:20:31.831 --> 00:20:33.630
<v Speaker 2>could be leading to an effect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

456
00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:35.190
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's actually,</v>

457
00:20:35.191 --> 00:20:35.940
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

458
00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:36.773
<v Speaker 2>the changes in the microbiome are really</v>
<v Speaker 2>important because there's actually been </v>

459
00:20:39.630 --> 00:20:41.820
<v Speaker 2>a few animal studies which have led to </v>
<v Speaker 2>phase one,</v>

460
00:20:41.821 --> 00:20:45.120
<v Speaker 2>phase two and phase three clinical </v>
<v Speaker 2>trials that have been done in humans.</v>

461
00:20:45.121 --> 00:20:45.954
<v Speaker 2>So I'm cumins with multiple sclerosis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're treated with minocycline an </v>

462
00:20:49.541 --> 00:20:50.374
<v Speaker 2>antibiotic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they've been basically the </v>

463
00:20:51.881 --> 00:20:52.714
<v Speaker 2>antibiotic was shown to improve symptoms</v>
<v Speaker 2>of multiple sclerosis and because there </v>

464
00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:59.410
<v Speaker 2>there's good bacteria and bad bacteria </v>
<v Speaker 2>that had been linked to autoimmunity and</v>

465
00:20:59.411 --> 00:21:01.940
<v Speaker 2>getting rid of getting rid of bacteria,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

466
00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:05.230
<v Speaker 2>the bad bacteria is going to probably </v>
<v Speaker 2>lead to improvements and that's what was</v>

467
00:21:05.231 --> 00:21:06.550
<v Speaker 2>shown in animal studies.</v>

468
00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:07.653
<v Speaker 2>And then in human trials.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So humans I'm taking with multiple </v>

469
00:21:11.321 --> 00:21:13.810
<v Speaker 2>sclerosis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>taking motorcycling for two years.</v>

470
00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:15.033
<v Speaker 2>So basically they had improvements that </v>
<v Speaker 2>delay the onset or progression of the </v>

471
00:21:18.550 --> 00:21:19.383
<v Speaker 2>disease.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then after two years those </v>

472
00:21:21.701 --> 00:21:22.534
<v Speaker 2>improvements went away probably because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're wiping out the microbiome and </v>

473
00:21:24.730 --> 00:21:26.760
<v Speaker 2>eventually you're also getting rid of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the bad,</v>

474
00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:29.230
<v Speaker 2>the good bacteria and so that things are</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to catch up.</v>

475
00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:30.670
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're not just,</v>

476
00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:31.713
<v Speaker 2>you may be getting rid of some of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>pathogenic bad bacteria with </v>

477
00:21:33.611 --> 00:21:34.444
<v Speaker 2>antibiotics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but eventually like you're also getting </v>

478
00:21:35.981 --> 00:21:37.900
<v Speaker 2>rid of good stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So long term,</v>

479
00:21:38.350 --> 00:21:40.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you may not have those same improvements</v>

480
00:21:40.871 --> 00:21:42.120
<v Speaker 2>and that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's very interesting.</v>

481
00:21:42.150 --> 00:21:43.930
<v Speaker 2>I think it's really important point to </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand,</v>

482
00:21:44.410 --> 00:21:45.243
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

483
00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:46.133
<v Speaker 2>with something like changes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very profound changes in the microbiome </v>

484
00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:53.050
<v Speaker 2>when it comes to someone just eating </v>
<v Speaker 2>meat.</v>

485
00:21:54.610 --> 00:21:55.443
<v Speaker 2>So one thing to keep in mind with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the microbiome is that basically </v>

486
00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:03.430
<v Speaker 2>the bacteria really are good at adapting</v>
<v Speaker 2>to their environment.</v>

487
00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:06.070
<v Speaker 2>That's why the antibiotic resistance is </v>
<v Speaker 2>such a big deal.</v>

488
00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:08.680
<v Speaker 2>And when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's been human intervention studies,</v>

489
00:22:08.681 --> 00:22:12.460
<v Speaker 2>when you take a human that goes from a </v>
<v Speaker 2>high fiber diet to a low fiber,</v>

490
00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:13.473
<v Speaker 2>high protein or vice versa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get changes in their gut microbiome </v>

491
00:22:18.550 --> 00:22:19.383
<v Speaker 2>that happened within 24 hours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So within an hour you actually start to </v>

492
00:22:22.391 --> 00:22:23.224
<v Speaker 2>have doubling of populations of bacteria</v>
<v Speaker 2>and within 24 to 48 hours do you </v>

493
00:22:26.021 --> 00:22:29.800
<v Speaker 2>actually start to lose other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So basically other bacteria start to die</v>

494
00:22:29.801 --> 00:22:32.350
<v Speaker 2>off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is at the species level,</v>

495
00:22:32.410 --> 00:22:33.243
<v Speaker 2>it's really hard to change the Fila.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Fila is more linked to longterm </v>

496
00:22:35.290 --> 00:22:38.350
<v Speaker 2>dietary patterns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eventually you can change as well.</v>

497
00:22:38.351 --> 00:22:39.560
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

498
00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:41.460
<v Speaker 2>it's been shown that people that go from</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

499
00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:42.733
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a more high fiber to a high protein </v>

500
00:22:44.111 --> 00:22:44.944
<v Speaker 2>diet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have changed their microbiome and </v>

501
00:22:47.410 --> 00:22:48.243
<v Speaker 2>these changes are a lot of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>microbiome bacteria that are fermenting </v>

502
00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:53.573
<v Speaker 2>a variety of fermentable fibers start to</v>
<v Speaker 2>leave and you actually start to get </v>

503
00:22:56.741 --> 00:22:58.900
<v Speaker 2>bacteria cropping up that ferment amino </v>
<v Speaker 2>acids.</v>

504
00:22:59.470 --> 00:23:02.970
<v Speaker 2>So the amino acids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>amino acids,</v>

505
00:23:02.971 --> 00:23:04.060
<v Speaker 2>simple sugars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fats,</v>

506
00:23:04.061 --> 00:23:06.130
<v Speaker 2>those are mostly absorbed in the small </v>
<v Speaker 2>intestine,</v>

507
00:23:06.131 --> 00:23:08.830
<v Speaker 2>but some of them make their way into the</v>
<v Speaker 2>large intestine.</v>

508
00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:11.680
<v Speaker 2>And there's a whole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

509
00:23:12.730 --> 00:23:15.520
<v Speaker 2>group of bacteria called the </v>
<v Speaker 2>putrifactive bacteria.</v>

510
00:23:15.521 --> 00:23:16.354
<v Speaker 2>And they ferment amino acids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And some of these species of </v>

511
00:23:19.270 --> 00:23:22.510
<v Speaker 2>putrifactive bacteria has been linked to</v>
<v Speaker 2>colon cancer.</v>

512
00:23:23.380 --> 00:23:25.630
<v Speaker 2>There are much higher in colon cancer </v>
<v Speaker 2>patients.</v>

513
00:23:25.910 --> 00:23:27.850
<v Speaker 2>Animal studies have shown,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

514
00:23:27.940 --> 00:23:28.773
<v Speaker 2>causal links where they can basically </v>
<v Speaker 2>regressively cause a polyp to form a </v>

515
00:23:33.610 --> 00:23:34.443
<v Speaker 2>tumor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's because these bacteria are </v>

516
00:23:36.641 --> 00:23:39.420
<v Speaker 2>making things called racine and </v>
<v Speaker 2>cadaveric,</v>

517
00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:40.833
<v Speaker 2>which are damaging their genotoxic </v>
<v Speaker 2>agents that damaged the DNA inside your </v>

518
00:23:44.111 --> 00:23:45.800
<v Speaker 2>colon cells.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

519
00:23:45.810 --> 00:23:48.320
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that are typically eating like an</v>

520
00:23:48.350 --> 00:23:49.183
<v Speaker 2>omnivore type of vibe where they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>eating protein and they're also eating </v>

521
00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:52.393
<v Speaker 2>fermentable fiber if they're eating the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fermentable fiber that's facilitating </v>

522
00:23:55.341 --> 00:23:57.740
<v Speaker 2>the growth of lactic acid producing </v>
<v Speaker 2>bacteria,</v>

523
00:23:58.430 --> 00:23:59.263
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that limits the growth of putrifactive </v>

524
00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:03.290
<v Speaker 2>be so if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if your bifidobacteria,</v>

525
00:24:03.291 --> 00:24:06.650
<v Speaker 2>lactobacillus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>s mutans as Thermophilus,</v>

526
00:24:06.651 --> 00:24:09.080
<v Speaker 2>those strains of bacteria are elected </v>
<v Speaker 2>acid producing bacteria,</v>

527
00:24:09.410 --> 00:24:11.120
<v Speaker 2>which you'd be getting if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

528
00:24:11.121 --> 00:24:11.954
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd be facilitating the growth of if </v>

529
00:24:12.801 --> 00:24:15.830
<v Speaker 2>you're eating plants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mental fermentable fiber,</v>

530
00:24:16.340 --> 00:24:17.173
<v Speaker 2>you're going to limit the growth of </v>
<v Speaker 2>putrifactive because they can't grow </v>

531
00:24:19.371 --> 00:24:20.204
<v Speaker 2>with lactic acid.</v>

532
00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:23.300
<v Speaker 2>So it's not like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not a huge,</v>

533
00:24:23.301 --> 00:24:24.134
<v Speaker 2>huge concern.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the question is what happens when </v>

534
00:24:26.451 --> 00:24:29.840
<v Speaker 2>you're only eating when you're only </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting immuno acids,</v>

535
00:24:30.210 --> 00:24:32.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so is there a longterm?</v>

536
00:24:32.090 --> 00:24:32.930
<v Speaker 2>So if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're,</v>

537
00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:34.033
<v Speaker 2>if you're killing off potentially some </v>
<v Speaker 2>of this pathogenic bacteria and you're </v>

538
00:24:37.671 --> 00:24:39.740
<v Speaker 2>having this effect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a positive effect,</v>

539
00:24:40.230 --> 00:24:42.590
<v Speaker 2>what's going to happen long term?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not known.</v>

540
00:24:42.750 --> 00:24:43.401
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this data,</v>

541
00:24:43.401 --> 00:24:44.234
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it hasn't really been studied at that </v>

542
00:24:44.871 --> 00:24:45.704
<v Speaker 2>level,</v>

543
00:24:46.050 --> 00:24:46.883
<v Speaker 4>been a few people that have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>have anecdotal stories about doing it </v>

544
00:24:50.101 --> 00:24:52.260
<v Speaker 4>for 10,</v>
<v Speaker 4>20 years that are online,</v>

545
00:24:52.261 --> 00:24:54.270
<v Speaker 4>but it's very difficult to track,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

546
00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:55.800
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

547
00:24:55.850 --> 00:24:58.140
<v Speaker 4>it's that you have take them at their </v>
<v Speaker 4>word for it.</v>

548
00:24:58.141 --> 00:25:00.480
<v Speaker 4>They eat nothing but meat for 20 years </v>
<v Speaker 4>and they feel amazing,</v>

549
00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:02.630
<v Speaker 4>but there's not very many of them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a,</v>

550
00:25:03.230 --> 00:25:03.970
<v Speaker 4>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

551
00:25:03.970 --> 00:25:06.990
<v Speaker 4>there may be more out there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's in terms of like what I've come</v>

552
00:25:06.991 --> 00:25:08.880
<v Speaker 4>across articles,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

553
00:25:08.910 --> 00:25:11.340
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just a social media profiles,</v>

554
00:25:11.341 --> 00:25:13.200
<v Speaker 4>people to talk about the positive </v>
<v Speaker 4>benefits of it.</v>

555
00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:14.513
<v Speaker 4>It seems to me that most people that are</v>
<v Speaker 4>talking about the positive benefits are </v>

556
00:25:17.521 --> 00:25:19.500
<v Speaker 4>talking about it within a one and two </v>
<v Speaker 4>year window.</v>

557
00:25:20.220 --> 00:25:22.560
<v Speaker 4>That's what we're really dealing with a </v>
<v Speaker 4>lot of.</v>

558
00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:23.940
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sean Baker,</v>

559
00:25:23.941 --> 00:25:27.210
<v Speaker 4>Dr Sean Baker who is probably the </v>
<v Speaker 4>leading proponent of it,</v>

560
00:25:27.211 --> 00:25:28.044
<v Speaker 4>or one of the poster boys of it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>along with Jordan Peterson and his </v>

561
00:25:29.911 --> 00:25:32.040
<v Speaker 4>daughter Mckayla,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a Jordan Peterson,</v>

562
00:25:32.041 --> 00:25:32.910
<v Speaker 4>his daughter Mckayla.</v>

563
00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:37.230
<v Speaker 4>They're different in that they were </v>
<v Speaker 4>dealing with severe autoimmune issues.</v>

564
00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:41.280
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his daughters had two joints replaced,</v>

565
00:25:41.281 --> 00:25:42.114
<v Speaker 4>but before she was 18 she had her,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well she had her ankle replaced before </v>

566
00:25:46.081 --> 00:25:51.081
<v Speaker 4>she was 18 and I think she had her hip </v>
<v Speaker 4>replaced shortly after that and um,</v>

567
00:25:51.660 --> 00:25:52.493
<v Speaker 4>Jordan has had some pretty severe </v>
<v Speaker 4>autoimmune issues and depression within </v>

568
00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:59.490
<v Speaker 4>with both of them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those things were cleared up,</v>

569
00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:02.190
<v Speaker 4>but as you've talked about multiple </v>
<v Speaker 4>times before on this show,</v>

570
00:26:02.610 --> 00:26:06.000
<v Speaker 4>depression has been linked to disorders </v>
<v Speaker 4>in the gut biome.</v>

571
00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:08.490
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And this is something that you feel like</v>

572
00:26:08.491 --> 00:26:09.324
<v Speaker 4>may be contributing to this as long as,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as well as both of them also got very </v>

573
00:26:12.721 --> 00:26:14.760
<v Speaker 4>lean.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jordan lost a ton of weight.</v>

574
00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:15.833
<v Speaker 4>He's back to the weight that he was when</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was 25 years old and I've eaten with </v>

575
00:26:19.261 --> 00:26:22.380
<v Speaker 4>him and the guy eats,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he eats a lot,</v>

576
00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:26.610
<v Speaker 4>but it's a lot of meat just like he'll </v>
<v Speaker 4>eat like a 30 ounce steak,</v>

577
00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:28.560
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is just crazy.</v>

578
00:26:28.561 --> 00:26:31.110
<v Speaker 4>It's a crazy amount of meat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

579
00:26:31.111 --> 00:26:31.944
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how many times he's doing </v>

580
00:26:32.521 --> 00:26:33.900
<v Speaker 4>that a day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

581
00:26:34.350 --> 00:26:35.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

582
00:26:35.691 --> 00:26:36.770
<v Speaker 2>I think I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

583
00:26:36.860 --> 00:26:38.070
<v Speaker 2>going back to the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

584
00:26:38.180 --> 00:26:41.660
<v Speaker 2>the point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like there are other,</v>

585
00:26:41.730 --> 00:26:42.563
<v Speaker 2>you understanding the mechanisms is and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of potential confounding </v>

586
00:26:45.241 --> 00:26:46.170
<v Speaker 2>factors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

587
00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:50.490
<v Speaker 2>And that with any anecdotal data is </v>
<v Speaker 2>extremely important to consider.</v>

588
00:26:50.491 --> 00:26:52.870
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people can't even neutral,</v>

589
00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:53.790
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>scientists,</v>

590
00:26:53.791 --> 00:26:57.570
<v Speaker 2>nutritionists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just people can't even agree on the best</v>

591
00:26:57.571 --> 00:26:58.404
<v Speaker 2>diet because a lot of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>epidemiological and observational </v>

592
00:27:01.981 --> 00:27:02.814
<v Speaker 2>studies which don't establish causation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have an enormous amount of confounding </v>

593
00:27:06.211 --> 00:27:10.530
<v Speaker 2>factors and it is freaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so hard to like control for that.</v>

594
00:27:10.830 --> 00:27:11.663
<v Speaker 2>I mean just as a perfect example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've talked about this before on the </v>

595
00:27:14.401 --> 00:27:15.151
<v Speaker 2>podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

596
00:27:15.151 --> 00:27:17.220
<v Speaker 2>the vegetarian versus people that eat </v>
<v Speaker 2>meat,</v>

597
00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:20.360
<v Speaker 2>one of the really large studies that was</v>
<v Speaker 2>done and,</v>

598
00:27:20.380 --> 00:27:21.213
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Dr Valter Longo was part of that </v>

599
00:27:21.841 --> 00:27:22.674
<v Speaker 2>study looked at all cause mortality and </v>
<v Speaker 2>cancer mortality and it was lower and </v>

600
00:27:26.071 --> 00:27:26.904
<v Speaker 2>vegetarians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they decided to take the mediators </v>

601
00:27:28.620 --> 00:27:29.101
<v Speaker 2>and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

602
00:27:29.101 --> 00:27:30.660
<v Speaker 2>what about within this group?</v>

603
00:27:31.470 --> 00:27:34.650
<v Speaker 2>The people that are healthy meat eaters </v>
<v Speaker 2>are people that are,</v>

604
00:27:34.651 --> 00:27:35.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>

605
00:27:35.250 --> 00:27:36.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not unhealthy.</v>

606
00:27:36.631 --> 00:27:38.360
<v Speaker 2>So they're not obese.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not sedentary,</v>

607
00:27:38.370 --> 00:27:39.410
<v Speaker 2>they're not smoking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the not alcohol,</v>

608
00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:42.330
<v Speaker 2>not excessively drinking alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those people,</v>

609
00:27:42.331 --> 00:27:44.640
<v Speaker 2>when they took out that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those confounding factors,</v>

610
00:27:44.910 --> 00:27:48.330
<v Speaker 2>the mediators had the same mortality as </v>
<v Speaker 2>a vegetarian,</v>

611
00:27:48.750 --> 00:27:49.583
<v Speaker 2>same cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So confounding factors are so important </v>

612
00:27:51.871 --> 00:27:54.810
<v Speaker 2>and that with anything with anecdotal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have people that are exercising like</v>

613
00:27:54.811 --> 00:27:55.644
<v Speaker 2>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exercise is also been shown to change </v>

614
00:27:57.050 --> 00:27:58.470
<v Speaker 2>microbiome,</v>
<v Speaker 2>independent of diet,</v>

615
00:27:58.910 --> 00:27:59.743
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a positive way where you're actually </v>

616
00:28:00.511 --> 00:28:04.950
<v Speaker 2>producing more of the bacteria that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>producing things like lactic acid.</v>

617
00:28:05.310 --> 00:28:08.730
<v Speaker 2>So in fasting does the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you have people that are fasting.</v>

618
00:28:08.731 --> 00:28:09.564
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

619
00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:13.100
<v Speaker 2>it's not like you can't do other things </v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're on that type of bed to,</v>

620
00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:16.800
<v Speaker 2>to sort of help with the microbiome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think again,</v>

621
00:28:17.490 --> 00:28:20.490
<v Speaker 2>if there's a way you can do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

622
00:28:20.491 --> 00:28:24.480
<v Speaker 2>if there's a way that you can get these </v>
<v Speaker 2>benefits without having to do something.</v>

623
00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:26.700
<v Speaker 2>So hyperdub restrictive and we'll talk </v>
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>

624
00:28:26.701 --> 00:28:27.960
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have concerns for that.</v>

625
00:28:27.961 --> 00:28:30.400
<v Speaker 2>We can definitely get into that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

626
00:28:30.460 --> 00:28:32.670
<v Speaker 2>then why not try that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

627
00:28:32.671 --> 00:28:33.840
<v Speaker 2>the thing with like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

628
00:28:33.990 --> 00:28:36.420
<v Speaker 2>doing like a prolonged fast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

629
00:28:36.421 --> 00:28:38.160
<v Speaker 2>once,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once a quarter,</v>

630
00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:41.100
<v Speaker 2>once every couple of months,</v>
<v Speaker 2>depending on how severe your your issues</v>

631
00:28:41.101 --> 00:28:42.270
<v Speaker 2>are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's,</v>

632
00:28:42.380 --> 00:28:45.180
<v Speaker 2>there's been benefits shown with that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like an aging,</v>

633
00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:46.073
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

634
00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:48.510
<v Speaker 2>so people that have been put on this </v>
<v Speaker 2>fasting mimicking diet,</v>

635
00:28:48.511 --> 00:28:51.320
<v Speaker 2>they have improved biomarkers of aging.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

636
00:28:51.390 --> 00:28:53.190
<v Speaker 2>they increase their lean muscle mass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

637
00:28:53.191 --> 00:28:55.950
<v Speaker 2>so like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an animal studies and you can't directly</v>

638
00:28:55.951 --> 00:28:56.784
<v Speaker 2>translate the animal studies to humans </v>
<v Speaker 2>because rodents have a really fast </v>

639
00:29:00.121 --> 00:29:03.000
<v Speaker 2>metabolism and if you fast them for 48 </v>
<v Speaker 2>hours,</v>

640
00:29:03.001 --> 00:29:03.834
<v Speaker 2>they lose 20 percent of their body </v>
<v Speaker 2>weight where humans only losing one or </v>

641
00:29:05.581 --> 00:29:06.480
<v Speaker 2>two percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

642
00:29:06.481 --> 00:29:09.120
<v Speaker 2>that's like clearly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

643
00:29:09.430 --> 00:29:10.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

644
00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:11.593
<v Speaker 2>So you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean obviously you can't completely </v>

645
00:29:13.531 --> 00:29:16.320
<v Speaker 2>translate everything that's done in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>fascinating roden to humans.</v>

646
00:29:16.321 --> 00:29:19.830
<v Speaker 2>But there are definitely organs are </v>
<v Speaker 2>shrinking.</v>

647
00:29:19.831 --> 00:29:23.100
<v Speaker 2>And then literally we growing after the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fast is over.</v>

648
00:29:23.101 --> 00:29:25.740
<v Speaker 2>Like it's like this rejuvenation </v>
<v Speaker 2>process.</v>

649
00:29:26.150 --> 00:29:29.310
<v Speaker 2>And it seems as though selectively </v>
<v Speaker 2>damage cells are killed.</v>

650
00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:30.540
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this whole,</v>

651
00:29:30.541 --> 00:29:32.030
<v Speaker 2>like there's a whole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

652
00:29:32.340 --> 00:29:36.960
<v Speaker 2>Dr Valter Longo showing that cancer </v>
<v Speaker 2>cells are really,</v>

653
00:29:36.961 --> 00:29:38.760
<v Speaker 2>really susceptible to dying when </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

654
00:29:38.790 --> 00:29:42.220
<v Speaker 2>when you do like a prolonged fast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even a fasting mimicking diet,</v>

655
00:29:42.550 --> 00:29:43.430
<v Speaker 2>and he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>

656
00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:44.313
<v Speaker 2>he's shown this an animal studies and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you send a couple of clinical studies </v>

657
00:29:47.460 --> 00:29:48.293
<v Speaker 2>were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>were patients with cancer were treated </v>

658
00:29:49.781 --> 00:29:50.614
<v Speaker 2>with standard of care,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but before their standard of care </v>

659
00:29:52.511 --> 00:29:54.880
<v Speaker 2>treatment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were faster to for up to 72 hours.</v>

660
00:29:55.320 --> 00:29:56.153
<v Speaker 2>And what happens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what he shown in animal studies happens </v>

661
00:29:58.931 --> 00:30:01.270
<v Speaker 2>is that because the fasting is a type of</v>
<v Speaker 2>stress,</v>

662
00:30:01.271 --> 00:30:04.600
<v Speaker 2>all your healthy cells increase all </v>
<v Speaker 2>these stress response pathways.</v>

663
00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:05.433
<v Speaker 2>They make more heat shock proteins.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're increasing antioxidant </v>

664
00:30:07.331 --> 00:30:09.200
<v Speaker 2>production pathways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>antiinflammatory.</v>

665
00:30:09.220 --> 00:30:11.170
<v Speaker 2>They're doing all this really good stuff</v>
<v Speaker 2>in response.</v>

666
00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:13.930
<v Speaker 2>Cancer cells can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like screwed up.</v>

667
00:30:14.230 --> 00:30:16.910
<v Speaker 2>And so they can't activate the stress </v>
<v Speaker 2>response pathway.</v>

668
00:30:16.911 --> 00:30:17.744
<v Speaker 2>So it ends up killing them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what you end up happening happening </v>

669
00:30:19.670 --> 00:30:20.503
<v Speaker 2>happening is that when you're giving </v>
<v Speaker 2>another genotoxic stress like chemo or </v>

670
00:30:24.731 --> 00:30:27.700
<v Speaker 2>radiation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your healthy cells become more resistant</v>

671
00:30:27.820 --> 00:30:29.380
<v Speaker 2>to the damaging effects of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>radiation.</v>

672
00:30:29.381 --> 00:30:31.570
<v Speaker 2>And the cancer cells become more </v>
<v Speaker 2>sensitized to the death.</v>

673
00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:35.560
<v Speaker 2>And so what he's shown him in his pilot </v>
<v Speaker 2>studies in humans is that basically,</v>

674
00:30:36.180 --> 00:30:37.810
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the humans that were,</v>

675
00:30:37.990 --> 00:30:38.823
<v Speaker 2>that were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that were treated with the standard of </v>

676
00:30:40.391 --> 00:30:43.270
<v Speaker 2>care,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was chemo and also fasted,</v>

677
00:30:43.540 --> 00:30:46.900
<v Speaker 2>they had less neutropenia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the loss of like neutrophils,</v>

678
00:30:46.901 --> 00:30:49.640
<v Speaker 2>which is the side effect because you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>losing normal healthy cells.</v>

679
00:30:49.641 --> 00:30:52.720
<v Speaker 2>So they had less of that happening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>less myelosuppression.</v>

680
00:30:53.650 --> 00:30:54.483
<v Speaker 2>So I mean anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the point is that I think if you can </v>

681
00:30:57.311 --> 00:31:00.650
<v Speaker 2>find a way to get positive benefits,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

682
00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:04.990
<v Speaker 2>without having to do something so risky </v>
<v Speaker 2>and potentially dangerous and unstudied,</v>

683
00:31:05.310 --> 00:31:06.420
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

684
00:31:06.740 --> 00:31:07.573
<v Speaker 2>in a unstudied in a really scientific </v>
<v Speaker 2>way of controlling for contract </v>

685
00:31:11.291 --> 00:31:13.570
<v Speaker 2>compounding factors and all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 2>longterm.</v>

686
00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:15.520
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just all of that is really important.</v>

687
00:31:15.890 --> 00:31:16.723
<v Speaker 4>Well then just comprehensive breakdown </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you just did is something that's </v>

688
00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:22.220
<v Speaker 4>really lacking from a lot of discussion </v>
<v Speaker 4>of this carnivore diet.</v>

689
00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:27.280
<v Speaker 4>And from the proponents of it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's almost like a lot of them are going</v>

690
00:31:27.831 --> 00:31:29.630
<v Speaker 4>into it blindfolded.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They'll like,</v>

691
00:31:29.631 --> 00:31:31.610
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it seems to be working.</v>

692
00:31:31.611 --> 00:31:35.570
<v Speaker 4>So I'm just going to stick with it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But again,</v>

693
00:31:35.900 --> 00:31:38.630
<v Speaker 4>when you're talking about most people's </v>
<v Speaker 4>cases,</v>

694
00:31:38.631 --> 00:31:41.150
<v Speaker 4>you're talking about one year,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe two years,</v>

695
00:31:41.151 --> 00:31:41.984
<v Speaker 4>sometimes even less,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where they're having these benefits and </v>

696
00:31:45.500 --> 00:31:46.333
<v Speaker 4>as you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's entirely possible that they're </v>

697
00:31:48.081 --> 00:31:51.650
<v Speaker 4>setting themselves up for some potential</v>
<v Speaker 4>longterm damage.</v>

698
00:31:51.750 --> 00:31:52.730
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

699
00:31:53.010 --> 00:31:55.020
<v Speaker 2>it is definitely possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>

700
00:31:55.021 --> 00:31:58.860
<v Speaker 2>at the end of the day there's no data,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no data.</v>

701
00:31:58.861 --> 00:32:00.440
<v Speaker 2>So you can say for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

702
00:32:00.630 --> 00:32:01.463
<v Speaker 2>there's no data,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I have concerns and we can talk </v>

703
00:32:02.821 --> 00:32:05.040
<v Speaker 2>about those concerns for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would like to.</v>

704
00:32:05.041 --> 00:32:09.140
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing is understanding mechanism,</v>

705
00:32:09.190 --> 00:32:10.470
<v Speaker 2>like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>going in blindly.</v>

706
00:32:10.650 --> 00:32:12.600
<v Speaker 2>I mean you have a hypothesis and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

707
00:32:12.601 --> 00:32:15.900
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your hypothesis is all plants are bad.</v>

708
00:32:16.530 --> 00:32:17.760
<v Speaker 2>That's what I keep hearing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>

709
00:32:17.761 --> 00:32:20.430
<v Speaker 2>well that's a hypothesis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what about all the other things that</v>

710
00:32:20.431 --> 00:32:24.300
<v Speaker 2>are potentially happening while you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing this diet and you're fasting more,</v>

711
00:32:24.390 --> 00:32:27.120
<v Speaker 2>your microbiomes changing dramatically </v>
<v Speaker 2>changing.</v>

712
00:32:27.270 --> 00:32:28.103
<v Speaker 2>And those things all have been known.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Multiple studies have shown that humans </v>

713
00:32:30.991 --> 00:32:34.770
<v Speaker 2>and animals mechanistic detail to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>benefits on autoimmunity,</v>

714
00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:37.860
<v Speaker 2>on aging in general,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on brain function.</v>

715
00:32:37.861 --> 00:32:39.500
<v Speaker 2>I mean all sorts of things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know.</v>

716
00:32:39.501 --> 00:32:40.334
<v Speaker 2>So it's mechanism is so important,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to realize that that's the </v>

717
00:32:44.151 --> 00:32:47.690
<v Speaker 2>whole basis of science,</v>
<v Speaker 2>understanding how the world works around</v>

718
00:32:47.691 --> 00:32:49.250
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>understanding how your body works,</v>

719
00:32:49.490 --> 00:32:52.730
<v Speaker 2>mechanisms like you have hypothesis and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very,</v>

720
00:32:52.731 --> 00:32:56.750
<v Speaker 2>and I understand it's like someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>experiences something positive.</v>

721
00:32:57.050 --> 00:32:59.030
<v Speaker 2>It's like well this must be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is it,</v>

722
00:32:59.031 --> 00:32:59.864
<v Speaker 2>this is the end all be all and.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you have to realize the shits </v>

723
00:33:04.070 --> 00:33:04.903
<v Speaker 2>complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to understand the mechanism and </v>

724
00:33:08.170 --> 00:33:12.020
<v Speaker 2>you may be doing something a longterm </v>
<v Speaker 2>that potentially.</v>

725
00:33:12.021 --> 00:33:14.750
<v Speaker 2>I mean it really hasn't been studied.</v>

726
00:33:14.950 --> 00:33:15.783
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>

727
00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:16.833
<v Speaker 4>Well that was one of the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I had Jordan's daughter Mckayla </v>

728
00:33:19.721 --> 00:33:23.560
<v Speaker 4>on who's had some pretty dramatic </v>
<v Speaker 4>results from this carnivore diet,</v>

729
00:33:23.830 --> 00:33:28.480
<v Speaker 4>but she's giving essentially nutrition </v>
<v Speaker 4>consulting to people,</v>

730
00:33:28.540 --> 00:33:31.600
<v Speaker 4>but she doesn't really have a background</v>
<v Speaker 4>in it and she's in.</v>

731
00:33:31.660 --> 00:33:34.150
<v Speaker 4>She doesn't have the information that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you just distributed,</v>

732
00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:37.330
<v Speaker 4>like what you just said to all these </v>
<v Speaker 4>people listening,</v>

733
00:33:37.990 --> 00:33:38.823
<v Speaker 4>the way you're describing the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the mechanisms and the benefits of </v>

734
00:33:41.381 --> 00:33:43.900
<v Speaker 4>fasting and all these different various </v>
<v Speaker 4>things that are happening inside of your</v>

735
00:33:43.901 --> 00:33:44.734
<v Speaker 4>gut and all these different things that </v>
<v Speaker 4>are happening with healthy cells and </v>

736
00:33:47.381 --> 00:33:52.381
<v Speaker 4>damaged cells with fasting and that this</v>
<v Speaker 4>is mimicked by this restrictive diet.</v>

737
00:33:52.691 --> 00:33:55.510
<v Speaker 4>And then this is all absent from the </v>
<v Speaker 4>dialogue.</v>

738
00:33:55.750 --> 00:33:56.583
<v Speaker 4>This is all absent from the dust and </v>
<v Speaker 4>this is one of the things that's </v>

739
00:33:58.030 --> 00:33:58.863
<v Speaker 4>disturbing the most disturbing for me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like I get that they're seeing </v>

740
00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:04.030
<v Speaker 4>positive results.</v>

741
00:34:04.130 --> 00:34:08.800
<v Speaker 4>I cannot deny that they're receiving,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but when they start saying,</v>

742
00:34:09.370 --> 00:34:10.031
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

743
00:34:10.031 --> 00:34:12.730
<v Speaker 4>plants are bad and there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

744
00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:13.953
<v Speaker 4>like my friend Chris,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's always talking about the war on </v>

745
00:34:15.191 --> 00:34:16.070
<v Speaker 4>carbs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's having real.</v>

746
00:34:16.190 --> 00:34:19.840
<v Speaker 4>He's also got Chris Bell.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's got autoimmune issues as well.</v>

747
00:34:20.020 --> 00:34:24.660
<v Speaker 4>He's had both of his hips replaced </v>
<v Speaker 4>before he was 35 and you know,</v>

748
00:34:24.670 --> 00:34:25.503
<v Speaker 4>severe arthritis and he is leaner than </v>
<v Speaker 4>he's ever been and benefiting greatly </v>

749
00:34:30.911 --> 00:34:33.130
<v Speaker 4>from this carnivore diet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>

750
00:34:33.131 --> 00:34:34.360
<v Speaker 4>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's like,</v>

751
00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:37.780
<v Speaker 4>he talks about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he uses Hashtag war on carbs,</v>

752
00:34:38.260 --> 00:34:40.000
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he doesn't eat salad,</v>

753
00:34:40.001 --> 00:34:42.430
<v Speaker 4>he won't eat greens.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think Greens are bad for you.</v>

754
00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:43.873
<v Speaker 4>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

755
00:34:43.980 --> 00:34:44.813
<v Speaker 4>I don't not sure that's correct.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's so important what you're </v>

756
00:34:49.031 --> 00:34:49.920
<v Speaker 4>saying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>

757
00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:50.800
<v Speaker 4>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

758
00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:51.713
<v Speaker 4>a researcher online that I've been in </v>
<v Speaker 4>contact with names Kevin Bass and his </v>

759
00:34:56.350 --> 00:34:58.700
<v Speaker 4>bass or bass be ass,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not sure what,</v>

760
00:34:58.720 --> 00:34:59.553
<v Speaker 4>how do you pronounce it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But he also brought up this possibility </v>

761
00:35:02.291 --> 00:35:03.124
<v Speaker 4>that it could be a calorie restriction </v>
<v Speaker 4>that these people are dealing with this </v>

762
00:35:07.570 --> 00:35:08.403
<v Speaker 4>essentially some of the same mechanisms </v>
<v Speaker 4>that are the positive reactions from </v>

763
00:35:13.121 --> 00:35:15.160
<v Speaker 4>fasting that you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're dealing with here.</v>

764
00:35:15.161 --> 00:35:17.830
<v Speaker 4>And I'm very happy that you're saying </v>
<v Speaker 4>the same thing.</v>

765
00:35:18.090 --> 00:35:18.721
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

766
00:35:18.721 --> 00:35:21.540
<v Speaker 2>I think that is one very strong </v>
<v Speaker 2>possibility.</v>

767
00:35:21.541 --> 00:35:23.440
<v Speaker 2>And that is something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

768
00:35:23.940 --> 00:35:26.580
<v Speaker 2>there's lots of hypotheses here and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

769
00:35:26.820 --> 00:35:27.653
<v Speaker 2>given all the data and there's lots of </v>
<v Speaker 2>positive data about eating plants as </v>

770
00:35:30.511 --> 00:35:31.430
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

771
00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:32.700
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really hard.</v>

772
00:35:33.330 --> 00:35:34.163
<v Speaker 2>That's one hypothesis and that seems to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be the one everyone's sort of </v>

773
00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:37.910
<v Speaker 2>gravitating to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

774
00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:39.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

775
00:35:39.370 --> 00:35:41.820
<v Speaker 2>if someone's also wanting to reduce </v>
<v Speaker 2>their,</v>

776
00:35:42.270 --> 00:35:44.640
<v Speaker 2>their glycemic load and all that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's,</v>

777
00:35:44.700 --> 00:35:45.533
<v Speaker 2>there are other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean eating just a modified Paleo </v>

778
00:35:47.730 --> 00:35:48.563
<v Speaker 2>Diet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I eat something like a modified </v>

779
00:35:49.051 --> 00:35:52.180
<v Speaker 2>Paleo Diet where it's like I'm eating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm eating fish and meat,</v>

780
00:35:52.240 --> 00:35:53.073
<v Speaker 2>meat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>poultry and a lot of leafy Greens and </v>

781
00:35:56.101 --> 00:35:56.934
<v Speaker 2>cruciferous vegetables.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you can do and nuts or you can do a </v>

782
00:36:00.151 --> 00:36:00.984
<v Speaker 2>ketogenic diet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they're like I just talked about </v>

783
00:36:02.850 --> 00:36:03.683
<v Speaker 2>the study that was done looking at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fasting mimicking diet and humans with </v>

784
00:36:07.591 --> 00:36:09.210
<v Speaker 2>multiple sclerosis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sclerosis.</v>

785
00:36:09.450 --> 00:36:10.810
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was uh,</v>

786
00:36:10.860 --> 00:36:11.693
<v Speaker 2>the same in publishing the same paper.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a study they study that put </v>

787
00:36:16.951 --> 00:36:17.784
<v Speaker 2>patients on Ketogenic Diet for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe it was three months and it </v>

788
00:36:21.451 --> 00:36:23.190
<v Speaker 2>improves symptoms of autoimmunity as </v>
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

789
00:36:23.370 --> 00:36:25.280
<v Speaker 2>Was it comparable?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

790
00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:26.080
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Improvement.</v>

791
00:36:26.080 --> 00:36:27.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

792
00:36:27.210 --> 00:36:28.950
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

793
00:36:28.951 --> 00:36:31.590
<v Speaker 2>the key to genic die a modified </v>
<v Speaker 2>ketogenic diet is also,</v>

794
00:36:31.860 --> 00:36:33.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's also concerns with that.</v>

795
00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:36.630
<v Speaker 2>Not everyone responds very well and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

796
00:36:36.631 --> 00:36:38.640
<v Speaker 2>the micronutrient deficiencies have been</v>
<v Speaker 2>a concern,</v>

797
00:36:38.641 --> 00:36:41.570
<v Speaker 2>but you can actually eat a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>vegetables,</v>

798
00:36:41.650 --> 00:36:42.600
<v Speaker 2>vegetables,</v>
<v Speaker 2>green,</v>

799
00:36:42.601 --> 00:36:44.440
<v Speaker 2>a good ones that are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are low and glycaemic.</v>

800
00:36:44.460 --> 00:36:47.460
<v Speaker 2>So my concern exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my concerns are much,</v>

801
00:36:47.461 --> 00:36:48.620
<v Speaker 2>much less,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

802
00:36:48.740 --> 00:36:50.840
<v Speaker 2>and it's been studied a lot more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

803
00:36:50.850 --> 00:36:51.683
<v Speaker 2>at least there's been lifespan studies </v>
<v Speaker 2>in animals on ketogenic diet where it's </v>

804
00:36:54.601 --> 00:36:56.220
<v Speaker 2>like improving,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

805
00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:58.530
<v Speaker 2>the way they age,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's improving their cognitive function,</v>

806
00:36:58.560 --> 00:37:00.750
<v Speaker 2>brain aging,</v>
<v Speaker 2>extending their lifespan.</v>

807
00:37:00.750 --> 00:37:01.620
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

808
00:37:01.621 --> 00:37:06.621
<v Speaker 2>if people are looking for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in addition to wanting to like help with</v>

809
00:37:07.621 --> 00:37:09.000
<v Speaker 2>their auto immunity issues,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

810
00:37:09.001 --> 00:37:09.960
<v Speaker 2>there's also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it's like,</v>

811
00:37:09.961 --> 00:37:10.794
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I also just don't want to have a lot of </v>

812
00:37:11.911 --> 00:37:12.744
<v Speaker 2>insulin response.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to lower my glycemic levels and </v>

813
00:37:15.211 --> 00:37:16.570
<v Speaker 2>things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

814
00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:17.833
<v Speaker 2>it seems like a much better option than,</v>
<v Speaker 2>than doing something completely </v>

815
00:37:21.601 --> 00:37:22.480
<v Speaker 2>unstudied.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

816
00:37:22.710 --> 00:37:24.690
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

817
00:37:25.250 --> 00:37:26.083
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's a really good place to </v>

818
00:37:27.271 --> 00:37:30.840
<v Speaker 2>start and obviously not disregarding </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone's anecdotes.</v>

819
00:37:30.841 --> 00:37:33.090
<v Speaker 2>And of course there's also the placebo </v>
<v Speaker 2>and no cpl effect,</v>

820
00:37:33.091 --> 00:37:36.270
<v Speaker 2>which are very real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean extremely well real.</v>

821
00:37:36.450 --> 00:37:37.283
<v Speaker 2>It's why a lot of drugs don't ever make </v>
<v Speaker 2>it to market is because they can't beat </v>

822
00:37:39.661 --> 00:37:41.730
<v Speaker 2>placebo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know where it's like,</v>

823
00:37:42.270 --> 00:37:43.103
<v Speaker 2>people think they're going to get a </v>
<v Speaker 2>positive response from something they </v>

824
00:37:45.421 --> 00:37:46.254
<v Speaker 2>can write and the opposite is true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People think they're going to get a </v>

825
00:37:48.661 --> 00:37:50.070
<v Speaker 2>negative response for something.</v>

826
00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:53.190
<v Speaker 2>They can just got to be a way to market </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

827
00:37:53.191 --> 00:37:56.610
<v Speaker 2>The placebo effect in a pill form.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's great.</v>

828
00:37:56.790 --> 00:37:57.623
<v Speaker 2>I think so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what's interesting is that genetics </v>

829
00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:01.800
<v Speaker 2>determines that there's snips.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gene,</v>

830
00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:02.793
<v Speaker 2>basically single nucleotide </v>
<v Speaker 2>polymorphisms where changes in the </v>

831
00:38:04.681 --> 00:38:08.130
<v Speaker 2>sequence of DNA in a certain gene makes </v>
<v Speaker 2>it function a little differently.</v>

832
00:38:08.550 --> 00:38:09.383
<v Speaker 2>While the gene that's really important </v>
<v Speaker 2>seems to be really important for either </v>

833
00:38:11.551 --> 00:38:12.384
<v Speaker 2>whether or not you're going to have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>placebo versus no CBO isn't controls </v>

834
00:38:15.211 --> 00:38:17.010
<v Speaker 2>dopamine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the degradation of dopamine,</v>

835
00:38:17.011 --> 00:38:17.844
<v Speaker 2>so people that are really likely to </v>
<v Speaker 2>placebo response have more dopamine in </v>

836
00:38:21.901 --> 00:38:24.000
<v Speaker 2>their brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's called comp t,</v>

837
00:38:24.001 --> 00:38:24.834
<v Speaker 2>the snip and the genes called comp t.</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that have less dopamine are more </v>

838
00:38:29.221 --> 00:38:30.054
<v Speaker 2>subject to the no cbo and this has been </v>
<v Speaker 2>shown in dose dependent manner in </v>

839
00:38:32.530 --> 00:38:34.230
<v Speaker 2>intervention,</v>
<v Speaker 2>intervention trials,</v>

840
00:38:34.231 --> 00:38:38.470
<v Speaker 2>randomized control in humans and not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not a diet.</v>

841
00:38:38.530 --> 00:38:41.200
<v Speaker 2>There's been studies on diet as well as </v>
<v Speaker 2>showing like no CBO effects,</v>

842
00:38:41.201 --> 00:38:44.260
<v Speaker 2>so people think they have a gluten </v>
<v Speaker 2>sensitivity,</v>

843
00:38:44.261 --> 00:38:45.094
<v Speaker 2>which I do think that's a real thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'm not saying non CELIAC gluten </v>

844
00:38:47.831 --> 00:38:48.664
<v Speaker 2>sensitivity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's enough evidence that </v>

845
00:38:49.421 --> 00:38:51.580
<v Speaker 2>showed that does exist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>

846
00:38:51.790 --> 00:38:52.623
<v Speaker 2>there was this great study that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>published four years ago showing people </v>

847
00:38:55.871 --> 00:38:57.580
<v Speaker 2>that thought they were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

848
00:38:57.700 --> 00:39:00.060
<v Speaker 2>having gluten sensitivity issues.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were,</v>

849
00:39:00.090 --> 00:39:04.210
<v Speaker 2>they were randomized and none of them </v>
<v Speaker 2>were given gluten,</v>

850
00:39:04.300 --> 00:39:05.133
<v Speaker 2>but they didn't know that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They thought maybe there's a chance I'm </v>

851
00:39:06.401 --> 00:39:08.350
<v Speaker 2>going to get the gluten.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know I'm being randomized.</v>

852
00:39:08.700 --> 00:39:12.520
<v Speaker 2>Of course they had a negative response.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had distended bloating,</v>

853
00:39:12.521 --> 00:39:14.080
<v Speaker 2>pain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there was no glue.</v>

854
00:39:14.860 --> 00:39:15.693
<v Speaker 2>So the no cbo effect is also real and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's something to keep in mind as </v>

855
00:39:18.881 --> 00:39:19.714
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you think,</v>

856
00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:20.993
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to have a bad response if I </v>

857
00:39:22.660 --> 00:39:26.480
<v Speaker 2>eat these plants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can fit there.</v>

858
00:39:26.500 --> 00:39:27.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's definitely,</v>

859
00:39:28.700 --> 00:39:31.060
<v Speaker 2>it's definitely a real thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think placebos much better.</v>

860
00:39:31.690 --> 00:39:34.480
<v Speaker 2>I think that's a great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it's a great thing that,</v>

861
00:39:34.481 --> 00:39:36.430
<v Speaker 2>that exists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially if you could figure out a way</v>

862
00:39:36.431 --> 00:39:37.264
<v Speaker 2>to trick yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're changing dopamine levels that </v>

863
00:39:39.930 --> 00:39:43.360
<v Speaker 2>affects your immune system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it affects a chiropractor who was</v>

864
00:39:43.361 --> 00:39:44.194
<v Speaker 2>banking on that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was doing something called zone </v>

865
00:39:46.661 --> 00:39:49.150
<v Speaker 2>healing and the more I pressed him on </v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

866
00:39:49.330 --> 00:39:50.380
<v Speaker 2>the more he basically said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

867
00:39:50.381 --> 00:39:52.270
<v Speaker 2>if you believe that it works,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

868
00:39:52.271 --> 00:39:53.104
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you're saying that it doesn't work </v>

869
00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:58.660
<v Speaker 2>unless you tricked this person into </v>
<v Speaker 2>believing that it works,</v>

870
00:39:58.661 --> 00:40:00.670
<v Speaker 2>so you're a trickster is what you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing.</v>

871
00:40:00.671 --> 00:40:02.500
<v Speaker 2>He didn't want to go that far,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's essentially,</v>

872
00:40:02.530 --> 00:40:03.363
<v Speaker 2>there's no real scientific basis to this</v>
<v Speaker 2>idea that you press on someone's back </v>

873
00:40:07.781 --> 00:40:11.710
<v Speaker 2>and fix the thyroid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I absolutely think that placebo accounts</v>

874
00:40:11.711 --> 00:40:12.970
<v Speaker 2>for a lot of that stuff.</v>

875
00:40:13.020 --> 00:40:14.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>

876
00:40:14.261 --> 00:40:15.610
<v Speaker 2>Reiki,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all that shit,</v>

877
00:40:15.700 --> 00:40:17.380
<v Speaker 2>all of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that um,</v>

878
00:40:17.630 --> 00:40:18.350
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

879
00:40:18.350 --> 00:40:22.540
<v Speaker 2>the genetic snips involved really they </v>
<v Speaker 2>do play a role.</v>

880
00:40:22.630 --> 00:40:25.390
<v Speaker 2>Is there a diet that increases dopamine </v>
<v Speaker 2>because there's.</v>

881
00:40:25.490 --> 00:40:26.323
<v Speaker 2>You can increase serotonin with htp and </v>
<v Speaker 2>to fan which converts to htp five htp </v>

882
00:40:31.270 --> 00:40:32.103
<v Speaker 2>what is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there anything that ramps up your </v>

883
00:40:34.231 --> 00:40:34.731
<v Speaker 2>dope?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

884
00:40:34.731 --> 00:40:37.150
<v Speaker 2>what does in the prefrontal cortex is </v>
<v Speaker 2>fish oil.</v>

885
00:40:37.240 --> 00:40:38.980
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>schizophrenia,</v>

886
00:40:39.220 --> 00:40:40.630
<v Speaker 2>schizophrenia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>schizophrenia,</v>

887
00:40:40.631 --> 00:40:42.750
<v Speaker 2>patients are prescribed a really high </v>
<v Speaker 2>dose because they,</v>

888
00:40:42.850 --> 00:40:43.683
<v Speaker 2>they lack,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're doping means lower and the </v>

889
00:40:44.651 --> 00:40:45.484
<v Speaker 2>prefrontal Cortex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is sort of associated with a </v>

890
00:40:46.601 --> 00:40:50.230
<v Speaker 2>lot of the negative paranoid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>delusional sort of.</v>

891
00:40:50.330 --> 00:40:52.120
<v Speaker 2>When you say high dose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you talking about?</v>

892
00:40:52.330 --> 00:40:53.740
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like six grand.</v>

893
00:40:53.750 --> 00:40:54.583
<v Speaker 2>Three.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anywhere between three to six grams a </v>

894
00:40:55.721 --> 00:40:57.340
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what does a normal dose?</v>

895
00:40:57.790 --> 00:40:58.623
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you look at,</v>

896
00:40:58.850 --> 00:40:59.683
<v Speaker 2>if you're talking about normal in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>sense where what's typically used in </v>

897
00:41:01.841 --> 00:41:04.420
<v Speaker 2>like a randomized controlled trial,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like one,</v>

898
00:41:04.510 --> 00:41:05.860
<v Speaker 2>one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one or two grams.</v>

899
00:41:05.890 --> 00:41:06.723
<v Speaker 2>What is recommended?</v>
<v Speaker 2>People like Usta or what would you </v>

900
00:41:09.011 --> 00:41:11.140
<v Speaker 2>recommend?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there's no recommended nothing.</v>

901
00:41:11.300 --> 00:41:14.590
<v Speaker 2>It's not now because because what's </v>
<v Speaker 2>recommended is the.</v>

902
00:41:14.930 --> 00:41:17.290
<v Speaker 2>So there's a plant version of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alpha linoleic acid,</v>

903
00:41:17.980 --> 00:41:21.490
<v Speaker 2>because you can convert that into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>marina,</v>

904
00:41:22.060 --> 00:41:24.640
<v Speaker 2>the marina omega three fatty acids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dha and EPA.</v>

905
00:41:25.170 --> 00:41:26.650
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the one that's recommended,</v>

906
00:41:26.651 --> 00:41:29.320
<v Speaker 2>so it's like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you essentially need,</v>

907
00:41:29.410 --> 00:41:30.243
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

908
00:41:30.430 --> 00:41:34.130
<v Speaker 2>so that's the one that's recommended,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they were concern about</v>

909
00:41:34.730 --> 00:41:35.563
<v Speaker 4>potential heavy metal poisonings when </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're taking in fish oil or is that </v>

910
00:41:38.181 --> 00:41:39.140
<v Speaker 4>all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all that stuff?</v>

911
00:41:39.300 --> 00:41:40.970
<v Speaker 4>Do they know how to filter that stuff </v>
<v Speaker 4>out?</v>

912
00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:45.450
<v Speaker 2>It's definitely purified out and I mean </v>
<v Speaker 2>it depends on the fish,</v>

913
00:41:46.490 --> 00:41:48.630
<v Speaker 2>the fish while you're getting your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your fish oil from.</v>

914
00:41:48.631 --> 00:41:49.650
<v Speaker 2>But there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

915
00:41:50.190 --> 00:41:51.023
<v Speaker 2>there's um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>international fish oil standards </v>

916
00:41:53.460 --> 00:41:54.970
<v Speaker 2>organization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

917
00:41:55.050 --> 00:41:57.740
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of different fish oil </v>
<v Speaker 2>companies,</v>

918
00:41:57.741 --> 00:42:00.120
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are tested by them and they show their,</v>

919
00:42:00.270 --> 00:42:02.700
<v Speaker 2>all their arsenic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mercury,</v>

920
00:42:02.730 --> 00:42:04.930
<v Speaker 2>pcbs and dioxins,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like all those,</v>

921
00:42:04.940 --> 00:42:06.810
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>potentially harmful compounds.</v>

922
00:42:07.170 --> 00:42:08.003
<v Speaker 2>And they also look at oxidized </v>
<v Speaker 2>polyunsaturated fatty acids for the </v>

923
00:42:11.761 --> 00:42:13.830
<v Speaker 2>looking at total oxidation and things </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

924
00:42:14.130 --> 00:42:17.700
<v Speaker 2>So that's a really good site to use to </v>
<v Speaker 2>look at whether,</v>

925
00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:19.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your fish oil brand is</v>

926
00:42:19.750 --> 00:42:20.583
<v Speaker 4>years in the pill form or do you do like</v>
<v Speaker 4>Carlson's where you get in the bottle </v>

927
00:42:23.741 --> 00:42:24.910
<v Speaker 4>and take spoonfuls of it?</v>

928
00:42:25.080 --> 00:42:25.913
<v Speaker 2>So I get mine in the pill form because I</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a friend that makes it in Norway </v>

929
00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:32.790
<v Speaker 2>and he sort of has convinced me that </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really good.</v>

930
00:42:32.820 --> 00:42:36.420
<v Speaker 2>So I really liked his fish oil and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't make it in the liquid form.</v>

931
00:42:36.990 --> 00:42:38.610
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I do.</v>

932
00:42:38.611 --> 00:42:39.444
<v Speaker 2>So I take,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I take about like five or six grams a </v>

933
00:42:41.101 --> 00:42:41.934
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I take a lot.</v>

934
00:42:42.240 --> 00:42:44.220
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Five or six grams.</v>

935
00:42:44.250 --> 00:42:45.083
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm taking like a high dose Dha </v>

936
00:42:46.591 --> 00:42:47.424
<v Speaker 2>because um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it gets into breast milk and I haven't </v>

937
00:42:50.041 --> 00:42:51.870
<v Speaker 2>100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When did my son just yet?</v>

938
00:42:51.930 --> 00:42:54.380
<v Speaker 2>How many pills is five or six grams?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

939
00:42:54.630 --> 00:42:55.530
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

940
00:42:55.710 --> 00:42:57.870
<v Speaker 2>that I take.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm taking six,</v>

941
00:42:57.960 --> 00:43:00.290
<v Speaker 2>six pills.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The pills or grant?</v>

942
00:43:00.320 --> 00:43:01.153
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

943
00:43:01.460 --> 00:43:02.293
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

944
00:43:02.310 --> 00:43:04.380
<v Speaker 2>that is high dose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really high dose.</v>

945
00:43:04.381 --> 00:43:06.420
<v Speaker 2>It's really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really good.</v>

946
00:43:06.421 --> 00:43:06.991
<v Speaker 2>Fisher.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>

947
00:43:06.991 --> 00:43:07.500
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

948
00:43:07.500 --> 00:43:09.960
<v Speaker 2>he's working on getting it available in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the United States.</v>

949
00:43:10.430 --> 00:43:11.263
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's supposed to happen like </v>

950
00:43:11.821 --> 00:43:13.870
<v Speaker 2>in the next couple of months.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

951
00:43:13.871 --> 00:43:17.130
<v Speaker 2>I used to take Carlson's Carlson's was a</v>
<v Speaker 2>bottle.</v>

952
00:43:17.510 --> 00:43:18.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what I take.</v>

953
00:43:18.900 --> 00:43:20.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you take a lot,</v>

954
00:43:20.071 --> 00:43:20.904
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

955
00:43:20.970 --> 00:43:21.810
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

956
00:43:21.811 --> 00:43:24.180
<v Speaker 2>But I'll take three tablespoons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought that was a lot.</v>

957
00:43:25.020 --> 00:43:30.020
<v Speaker 2>How much is in wondering idea?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll have to talk about my,</v>

958
00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:36.100
<v Speaker 2>my Alzheimer's will make it three </v>
<v Speaker 2>publication that we still have time.</v>

959
00:43:36.190 --> 00:43:37.480
<v Speaker 4>Carnivores stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's keep going.</v>

960
00:43:37.540 --> 00:43:38.373
<v Speaker 4>I'll put that aside because I actually </v>
<v Speaker 4>have a good friend whose dad has </v>

961
00:43:41.291 --> 00:43:46.291
<v Speaker 4>Alzheimer's and I sent her your clip </v>
<v Speaker 4>from your instagram from yesterday.</v>

962
00:43:48.910 --> 00:43:49.743
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cool.</v>

963
00:43:50.110 --> 00:43:51.160
<v Speaker 4>About that too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

964
00:43:51.190 --> 00:43:51.731
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

965
00:43:51.731 --> 00:43:52.280
<v Speaker 4>we will.</v>

966
00:43:52.280 --> 00:43:54.230
<v Speaker 2>I'll send you my paper.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just accepted.</v>

967
00:43:54.231 --> 00:43:55.600
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

968
00:43:55.640 --> 00:43:57.920
<v Speaker 2>it should be out online this month,</v>
<v Speaker 2>late sometime this month.</v>

969
00:43:58.220 --> 00:43:59.290
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

970
00:43:59.330 --> 00:44:00.163
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

971
00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:02.870
<v Speaker 2>My potential concerns with carnivore </v>
<v Speaker 2>diet,</v>

972
00:44:03.210 --> 00:44:04.290
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

973
00:44:04.310 --> 00:44:06.110
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure,</v>

974
00:44:06.111 --> 00:44:08.900
<v Speaker 2>I mean I know this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen it all over the blogosphere,</v>

975
00:44:08.910 --> 00:44:09.530
<v Speaker 2>is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

976
00:44:09.530 --> 00:44:12.180
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the micronutrients and you know,</v>

977
00:44:12.290 --> 00:44:14.360
<v Speaker 2>they don't really matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're rda is,</v>

978
00:44:14.361 --> 00:44:17.540
<v Speaker 2>weren't set for carnivores and all this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all this stuff that I've read.</v>

979
00:44:18.140 --> 00:44:19.880
<v Speaker 2>But I think to start out like </v>
<v Speaker 2>understanding,</v>

980
00:44:19.881 --> 00:44:20.714
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>micro nutrients are essential about 30 </v>

981
00:44:22.940 --> 00:44:24.380
<v Speaker 2>vitamins and minerals that are really </v>
<v Speaker 2>important.</v>

982
00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:26.930
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they do run our metabolism,</v>

983
00:44:26.931 --> 00:44:29.150
<v Speaker 2>they are involved in making </v>
<v Speaker 2>neurotransmitters.</v>

984
00:44:29.510 --> 00:44:30.920
<v Speaker 2>They're involved in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

985
00:44:30.990 --> 00:44:33.420
<v Speaker 2>pulling calcium out of our arteries and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Brittany tour bones,</v>

986
00:44:33.570 --> 00:44:34.403
<v Speaker 2>they're involved in all sorts of things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People when they hear the word </v>

987
00:44:36.961 --> 00:44:38.460
<v Speaker 2>metabolism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they always just think about,</v>

988
00:44:38.540 --> 00:44:39.373
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>food you eat,</v>

989
00:44:40.090 --> 00:44:43.530
<v Speaker 2>it's like metabolism refers to a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

990
00:44:43.770 --> 00:44:45.500
<v Speaker 2>And there's about 22,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry,</v>

991
00:44:45.501 --> 00:44:46.334
<v Speaker 2>there's 22 percent of all your enzymes </v>
<v Speaker 2>in your body require a micronutrient to </v>

992
00:44:49.591 --> 00:44:51.180
<v Speaker 2>function.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

993
00:44:51.240 --> 00:44:55.620
<v Speaker 2>and this is repairing damage from Dna,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all sorts of things really important.</v>

994
00:44:56.290 --> 00:45:00.060
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so there's about 30 of them that are</v>

995
00:45:00.061 --> 00:45:02.100
<v Speaker 2>essentially you have to get them for </v>
<v Speaker 2>your diet because you don't make them in</v>

996
00:45:02.101 --> 00:45:04.470
<v Speaker 2>your body and if you don't get them from</v>
<v Speaker 2>your diet,</v>

997
00:45:04.471 --> 00:45:07.590
<v Speaker 2>it can lead to health problems and death</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually.</v>

998
00:45:07.591 --> 00:45:08.780
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's,</v>

999
00:45:08.810 --> 00:45:09.690
<v Speaker 2>that's kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1000
00:45:09.830 --> 00:45:14.310
<v Speaker 2>what micronutrients are Rda.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So recommended dietary allowance,</v>

1001
00:45:14.760 --> 00:45:16.710
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those have been set,</v>

1002
00:45:17.190 --> 00:45:21.540
<v Speaker 2>a variety of different studies are used.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's randomized controlled trials,</v>

1003
00:45:21.541 --> 00:45:24.420
<v Speaker 2>non randomized controlled trials,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's depletion,</v>

1004
00:45:24.421 --> 00:45:26.460
<v Speaker 2>depletion studies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's balance studies.</v>

1005
00:45:26.461 --> 00:45:28.440
<v Speaker 2>Looking at how much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how long,</v>

1006
00:45:28.470 --> 00:45:30.900
<v Speaker 2>how much of a micronutrient it takes </v>
<v Speaker 2>before you start reading it.</v>

1007
00:45:31.390 --> 00:45:32.223
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's cross sectional studies and </v>

1008
00:45:33.451 --> 00:45:34.284
<v Speaker 2>there's case studies and this is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>collaboration between the United States </v>

1009
00:45:36.631 --> 00:45:39.690
<v Speaker 2>and Canada and some European countries </v>
<v Speaker 2>as well.</v>

1010
00:45:40.080 --> 00:45:40.913
<v Speaker 2>So a lot of experiments are done to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to figure out the recommended dietary </v>

1011
00:45:45.301 --> 00:45:47.520
<v Speaker 2>allowance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first thing that's done is the,</v>

1012
00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:52.230
<v Speaker 2>the estimated average wreck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the s e a ear,</v>

1013
00:45:52.231 --> 00:45:54.260
<v Speaker 2>the estimated average wreck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1014
00:45:54.540 --> 00:45:55.373
<v Speaker 2>intake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that is done by basically looking at </v>

1015
00:45:59.161 --> 00:46:00.450
<v Speaker 2>any population and going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1016
00:46:00.451 --> 00:46:02.400
<v Speaker 2>how much of this micronutrient do we </v>
<v Speaker 2>need?</v>

1017
00:46:02.401 --> 00:46:05.250
<v Speaker 2>So that 50 percent of the population has</v>
<v Speaker 2>adequate levels,</v>

1018
00:46:05.430 --> 00:46:08.280
<v Speaker 2>the other 50 percent will be deficient.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like there's a bell curve.</v>

1019
00:46:08.281 --> 00:46:09.114
<v Speaker 2>And so it's like literally in the middle</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the bell curve and then the RDA is </v>

1020
00:46:12.121 --> 00:46:14.040
<v Speaker 2>set from that two standard deviations </v>
<v Speaker 2>above.</v>

1021
00:46:14.041 --> 00:46:14.874
<v Speaker 2>And it's supposed to make about 97 point</v>
<v Speaker 2>five percent of the population gets </v>

1022
00:46:18.750 --> 00:46:19.583
<v Speaker 2>enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's how the Rda set for each </v>

1023
00:46:22.171 --> 00:46:23.004
<v Speaker 2>micronutrient.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's different than the experiments are </v>

1024
00:46:24.031 --> 00:46:25.200
<v Speaker 2>done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are different to look at them.</v>

1025
00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:27.570
<v Speaker 2>So there's a few concerns,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>

1026
00:46:27.630 --> 00:46:30.270
<v Speaker 2>with an all meat diet with particular </v>
<v Speaker 2>micronutrients,</v>

1027
00:46:30.300 --> 00:46:32.670
<v Speaker 2>because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>micronutrients,</v>

1028
00:46:32.880 --> 00:46:34.620
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1029
00:46:34.621 --> 00:46:35.454
<v Speaker 2>certain micronutrients that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>concentrated in meat and there's a lot </v>

1030
00:46:37.741 --> 00:46:38.574
<v Speaker 2>that are concentrated in plants and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can find some of the ones that are more </v>

1031
00:46:40.861 --> 00:46:44.700
<v Speaker 2>concentrated in meat in plants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most in most cases,</v>

1032
00:46:44.900 --> 00:46:45.733
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's much better to get it from the </v>

1033
00:46:47.400 --> 00:46:48.410
<v Speaker 2>meat and implants.</v>

1034
00:46:48.470 --> 00:46:49.800
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's much more concentrated,</v>

1035
00:46:49.830 --> 00:46:50.663
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you can find it in some amounts in </v>

1036
00:46:51.931 --> 00:46:53.100
<v Speaker 2>meat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's much,</v>

1037
00:46:53.190 --> 00:46:56.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a lot easier to get it from plants.</v>

1038
00:46:56.670 --> 00:46:57.503
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1039
00:46:57.630 --> 00:46:58.351
<v Speaker 2>one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>

1040
00:46:58.351 --> 00:47:00.180
<v Speaker 2>the micronutrients that the concern is </v>
<v Speaker 2>the vitamin C,</v>

1041
00:47:00.360 --> 00:47:01.150
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1042
00:47:01.150 --> 00:47:01.983
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the one that everyone talks </v>

1043
00:47:02.761 --> 00:47:03.594
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>

1044
00:47:05.460 --> 00:47:10.120
<v Speaker 2>So vitamin C is a really important </v>
<v Speaker 2>cofactor for what that means as cofactor</v>

1045
00:47:10.121 --> 00:47:12.870
<v Speaker 2>just means that it's binds to an enzyme </v>
<v Speaker 2>and helps it work.</v>

1046
00:47:13.050 --> 00:47:13.883
<v Speaker 2>It's important for making Collagen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's important for converting dopamine </v>

1047
00:47:15.751 --> 00:47:18.210
<v Speaker 2>into norepinephrine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is important for that,</v>

1048
00:47:18.270 --> 00:47:19.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>flight or flight response.</v>

1049
00:47:20.330 --> 00:47:21.860
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it plays a role in,</v>

1050
00:47:21.900 --> 00:47:25.700
<v Speaker 2>and I'm making carnitine which is </v>
<v Speaker 2>important for using fatty acids for,</v>

1051
00:47:25.760 --> 00:47:28.350
<v Speaker 2>it's for energy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1052
00:47:28.740 --> 00:47:29.573
<v Speaker 2>and then of course an antioxidant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It also plays a really important role </v>

1053
00:47:32.501 --> 00:47:33.550
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in neutrophils.</v>

1054
00:47:33.551 --> 00:47:37.390
<v Speaker 2>Their neutrophils are a type of immune </v>
<v Speaker 2>cell when they're activated,</v>

1055
00:47:37.391 --> 00:47:39.760
<v Speaker 2>when you have any sort of bacterial </v>
<v Speaker 2>exposure,</v>

1056
00:47:40.130 --> 00:47:41.920
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>virus,</v>

1057
00:47:42.280 --> 00:47:44.320
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things that can even come from the gut,</v>

1058
00:47:44.670 --> 00:47:46.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Lps,</v>

1059
00:47:46.270 --> 00:47:49.180
<v Speaker 2>we get from dead bacteria that are dying</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the gut.</v>

1060
00:47:49.900 --> 00:47:50.733
<v Speaker 2>Neutrophils get activated and they soak </v>
<v Speaker 2>up vitamin C because they release a </v>

1061
00:47:53.891 --> 00:47:57.370
<v Speaker 2>bunch of hydrogen peroxide which damages</v>
<v Speaker 2>the neutrophil itself.</v>

1062
00:47:57.370 --> 00:47:59.680
<v Speaker 2>And so the vitamin C's sort of prevents </v>
<v Speaker 2>that from happening,</v>

1063
00:48:00.340 --> 00:48:01.173
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>plays a really important role in cell </v>

1064
00:48:03.850 --> 00:48:05.920
<v Speaker 2>cell integrity and things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>

1065
00:48:06.010 --> 00:48:06.843
<v Speaker 2>the um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a variety of ways and vitamin C </v>

1066
00:48:08.651 --> 00:48:12.130
<v Speaker 2>is transported into the cell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I see a reading on the Internet,</v>

1067
00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:17.080
<v Speaker 2>a little bit of misunderstanding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People following the carnivore diet seem</v>

1068
00:48:17.081 --> 00:48:19.210
<v Speaker 2>to think that because they're not </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting any,</v>

1069
00:48:19.260 --> 00:48:20.800
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their glucose levels are low,</v>

1070
00:48:21.190 --> 00:48:24.810
<v Speaker 2>that they're getting more vitamin C in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1071
00:48:24.930 --> 00:48:28.390
<v Speaker 2>so vitamin C,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm also called ascorbic acid.</v>

1072
00:48:29.020 --> 00:48:29.853
<v Speaker 2>A goes between two different states or </v>
<v Speaker 2>scorebig acid is the reduced form which </v>

1073
00:48:34.571 --> 00:48:38.710
<v Speaker 2>has the antioxidant form.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It goes also into an oxidized form,</v>

1074
00:48:38.711 --> 00:48:39.544
<v Speaker 2>so it's kind of going back and forth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It goes through about four cycles of </v>

1075
00:48:41.021 --> 00:48:42.430
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the oxidized form,</v>

1076
00:48:42.431 --> 00:48:43.264
<v Speaker 2>it's called dehydroascorbic acid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's two ways that you transport </v>

1077
00:48:46.121 --> 00:48:48.610
<v Speaker 2>vitamin C,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you absorb it to the gut.</v>

1078
00:48:49.090 --> 00:48:52.000
<v Speaker 2>Epithelial cells is transported into a </v>
<v Speaker 2>variety of tissues in the body.</v>

1079
00:48:52.510 --> 00:48:56.020
<v Speaker 2>Ascorbic acid goes through sodium </v>
<v Speaker 2>dependent vitamin C transporters.</v>

1080
00:48:56.380 --> 00:49:00.040
<v Speaker 2>Those are not dependent on glucose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no competition for glucose.</v>

1081
00:49:00.130 --> 00:49:02.860
<v Speaker 2>The that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's how vitamin C gets into the cell,</v>

1082
00:49:03.530 --> 00:49:04.363
<v Speaker 2>and most cells actually transport </v>
<v Speaker 2>vitamin C in that form with the </v>

1083
00:49:07.841 --> 00:49:10.240
<v Speaker 2>exception of red blood cells,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which don't have that transporter.</v>

1084
00:49:10.241 --> 00:49:13.150
<v Speaker 2>They use another transporter called </v>
<v Speaker 2>glucose transporters or glute,</v>

1085
00:49:13.570 --> 00:49:16.300
<v Speaker 2>and that one does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Glucose does compete.</v>

1086
00:49:16.960 --> 00:49:20.350
<v Speaker 2>Interestingly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dehydroascorbic acid binds much better.</v>

1087
00:49:20.890 --> 00:49:21.723
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's actually slightly more by binds to </v>

1088
00:49:23.231 --> 00:49:25.540
<v Speaker 2>the transporter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then I'm glucose.</v>

1089
00:49:25.750 --> 00:49:27.750
<v Speaker 2>But in conditions like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1090
00:49:27.880 --> 00:49:30.400
<v Speaker 2>hyperglycemia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like type one or type two diabetics,</v>

1091
00:49:30.700 --> 00:49:33.970
<v Speaker 2>they actually don't get vitamin C into </v>
<v Speaker 2>the red blood cells and it leads to like</v>

1092
00:49:33.971 --> 00:49:35.650
<v Speaker 2>vascular problems and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1093
00:49:36.310 --> 00:49:37.143
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1094
00:49:38.020 --> 00:49:41.320
<v Speaker 2>it's an interesting hypothesis that </v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe if you're having,</v>

1095
00:49:41.340 --> 00:49:42.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>less of a,</v>

1096
00:49:42.251 --> 00:49:43.084
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your blood glucose levels are really </v>

1097
00:49:44.621 --> 00:49:45.250
<v Speaker 2>bottomed out.</v>

1098
00:49:45.250 --> 00:49:47.920
<v Speaker 2>Maybe there maybe that there's some </v>
<v Speaker 2>salvage pathway,</v>

1099
00:49:47.921 --> 00:49:48.754
<v Speaker 2>you're able to help get vitamin C in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>oxidized form is going in some other </v>

1100
00:49:52.301 --> 00:49:53.980
<v Speaker 2>cells that usually doesn't go in or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

1101
00:49:53.981 --> 00:49:56.050
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an interesting hypothesis,</v>

1102
00:49:56.051 --> 00:49:57.350
<v Speaker 2>which is there's no data on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1103
00:49:58.930 --> 00:50:03.160
<v Speaker 2>But the experiments that were done to </v>
<v Speaker 2>choose the rda for vitamin C,</v>

1104
00:50:03.400 --> 00:50:04.660
<v Speaker 2>we're done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1105
00:50:04.950 --> 00:50:05.783
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more recent rda so that it changed </v>

1106
00:50:07.720 --> 00:50:10.480
<v Speaker 2>back in like two that after 2000 or 2001</v>
<v Speaker 2>or something,</v>

1107
00:50:10.750 --> 00:50:14.350
<v Speaker 2>it's about 90 milligrams a day for men </v>
<v Speaker 2>and 75 for women,</v>

1108
00:50:14.730 --> 00:50:16.990
<v Speaker 2>they were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were depletion repletion studies.</v>

1109
00:50:16.991 --> 00:50:17.824
<v Speaker 2>So men were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>were given about less than five </v>

1110
00:50:21.521 --> 00:50:23.920
<v Speaker 2>milligrams a day of vitamin C,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you die with their diet.</v>

1111
00:50:24.400 --> 00:50:26.110
<v Speaker 2>And this was about a six months to </v>
<v Speaker 2>study.</v>

1112
00:50:26.111 --> 00:50:28.310
<v Speaker 2>There were in a metabolic ward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1113
00:50:28.311 --> 00:50:29.144
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was determined that it was kind of </v>

1114
00:50:31.611 --> 00:50:33.560
<v Speaker 2>unsafe to keep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to keep going.</v>

1115
00:50:34.040 --> 00:50:34.873
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so basically they started the repletion </v>

1116
00:50:37.010 --> 00:50:39.080
<v Speaker 2>where they started giving,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1117
00:50:39.410 --> 00:50:40.460
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these men,</v>

1118
00:50:40.490 --> 00:50:41.323
<v Speaker 2>vitamin C at different doses and a </v>
<v Speaker 2>vitamin C follows like a sigmoidal s </v>

1119
00:50:45.470 --> 00:50:46.303
<v Speaker 2>curve.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So once you kind of deplete someone in </v>

1120
00:50:48.311 --> 00:50:50.450
<v Speaker 2>their vitamin C,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you give them,</v>

1121
00:50:50.451 --> 00:50:51.920
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>30 milligrams,</v>

1122
00:50:52.010 --> 00:50:52.843
<v Speaker 2>it isn't really enough to kind of go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't really raise plasma levels </v>

1123
00:50:56.421 --> 00:50:57.920
<v Speaker 2>much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to get up to 100.</v>

1124
00:50:58.490 --> 00:50:59.323
<v Speaker 2>Once you get up to 100,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you actually start to excrete </v>

1125
00:51:02.241 --> 00:51:03.740
<v Speaker 2>vitamin C.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But before that you're just,</v>

1126
00:51:03.741 --> 00:51:06.020
<v Speaker 2>your body's holding onto everything or </v>
<v Speaker 2>not excluding anything.</v>

1127
00:51:06.410 --> 00:51:09.710
<v Speaker 2>Two hundred milligrams was a maximum </v>
<v Speaker 2>bioavailability.</v>

1128
00:51:09.950 --> 00:51:11.020
<v Speaker 2>And then after that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1129
00:51:11.570 --> 00:51:14.780
<v Speaker 2>you start to decrease bioavailability.</v>
<v Speaker 2>New York screening a lot of identity.</v>

1130
00:51:15.210 --> 00:51:16.280
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the new.</v>

1131
00:51:16.281 --> 00:51:18.190
<v Speaker 2>So the scientists that published this </v>
<v Speaker 2>paper,</v>

1132
00:51:18.210 --> 00:51:20.220
<v Speaker 2>Mark Levine at the Nih,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1133
00:51:21.230 --> 00:51:24.170
<v Speaker 2>recommended that the RDA be set at 200 </v>
<v Speaker 2>milligrams,</v>

1134
00:51:24.171 --> 00:51:25.004
<v Speaker 2>but it was set at 90,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is literally right before you </v>

1135
00:51:27.321 --> 00:51:29.390
<v Speaker 2>start to excrete,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was 100 milligrams.</v>

1136
00:51:29.840 --> 00:51:31.850
<v Speaker 2>That data,</v>
<v Speaker 2>along with the neutrophil data,</v>

1137
00:51:31.851 --> 00:51:33.650
<v Speaker 2>there were some neutrophil data that was</v>
<v Speaker 2>looked at.</v>

1138
00:51:33.651 --> 00:51:34.880
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1139
00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:35.833
<v Speaker 2>how much vitamin C was it important to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because neutrophil sop it up to prevent </v>

1140
00:51:39.291 --> 00:51:40.124
<v Speaker 2>that hydrogen peroxide induced damage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that's kind of how the RJ was </v>

1141
00:51:42.301 --> 00:51:46.580
<v Speaker 2>said.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm now the question is in any,</v>

1142
00:51:46.640 --> 00:51:47.930
<v Speaker 2>with any Rga,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1143
00:51:48.290 --> 00:51:49.123
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the important thing to consider is well </v>

1144
00:51:51.200 --> 00:51:54.260
<v Speaker 2>the rds are set to prevent acute </v>
<v Speaker 2>disease,</v>

1145
00:51:54.500 --> 00:51:57.590
<v Speaker 2>but what about promoting optimal health?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1146
00:51:57.591 --> 00:51:58.424
<v Speaker 2>like that's really important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like how much are these micronutrients </v>

1147
00:51:59.810 --> 00:52:02.030
<v Speaker 2>you need throughout our lifespan to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

1148
00:52:02.060 --> 00:52:04.790
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to maintain optimal health and age.</v>

1149
00:52:04.791 --> 00:52:05.624
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so this is something that's really </v>

1150
00:52:06.561 --> 00:52:07.394
<v Speaker 2>important because a lot of enzymes that </v>
<v Speaker 2>require micronutrient for preventing </v>

1151
00:52:11.871 --> 00:52:14.120
<v Speaker 2>short term disease,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something that can kill you.</v>

1152
00:52:14.240 --> 00:52:17.930
<v Speaker 2>Like there's also enzymes that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>required to prevent,</v>

1153
00:52:17.980 --> 00:52:19.790
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things that are associated with aging,</v>

1154
00:52:19.791 --> 00:52:20.840
<v Speaker 2>like DNA damage.</v>

1155
00:52:21.560 --> 00:52:23.870
<v Speaker 2>So if there's only so much of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>micronutrient around which,</v>

1156
00:52:23.871 --> 00:52:26.840
<v Speaker 2>where's it gonna go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it going to go where the,</v>

1157
00:52:26.841 --> 00:52:27.674
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it going to prevent any damage which </v>

1158
00:52:28.640 --> 00:52:31.370
<v Speaker 2>doesn't make a difference until five or </v>
<v Speaker 2>six decades later?</v>

1159
00:52:31.371 --> 00:52:35.330
<v Speaker 2>Or is it gonna make sure you live on to </v>
<v Speaker 2>pass on your genes and you know,</v>

1160
00:52:35.331 --> 00:52:36.800
<v Speaker 2>reproduce.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

1161
00:52:36.801 --> 00:52:38.810
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my former postdoctoral mentor,</v>

1162
00:52:38.811 --> 00:52:43.100
<v Speaker 2>Dr Bruce Ames,</v>
<v Speaker 2>proposed this whole and he has published</v>

1163
00:52:43.101 --> 00:52:46.700
<v Speaker 2>a couple of foundational papers </v>
<v Speaker 2>supporting this idea,</v>

1164
00:52:46.701 --> 00:52:47.534
<v Speaker 2>which he calls the triage theory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he's saying that basically he thinks </v>

1165
00:52:50.871 --> 00:52:53.210
<v Speaker 2>actually a lot of our days are too low </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that,</v>

1166
00:52:53.211 --> 00:52:54.044
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>optimal rdas will account for how much </v>

1167
00:52:56.631 --> 00:52:57.464
<v Speaker 2>is needed for these longterm functions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's really important to consider </v>

1168
00:53:00.831 --> 00:53:02.800
<v Speaker 2>with the vitamin C,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1169
00:53:04.010 --> 00:53:04.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1170
00:53:04.620 --> 00:53:05.120
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1171
00:53:05.120 --> 00:53:07.540
<v Speaker 2>it's really a small amount that's needed</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

1172
00:53:07.650 --> 00:53:10.930
<v Speaker 2>to be used as a cofactor for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1173
00:53:10.970 --> 00:53:13.760
<v Speaker 2>an enzyme for Collagen production and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you actually don't need that much.</v>

1174
00:53:14.490 --> 00:53:15.323
<v Speaker 2>And it was done like studies were done </v>
<v Speaker 2>years and years ago with that </v>

1175
00:53:17.750 --> 00:53:21.020
<v Speaker 2>established like 10 milligrams of </v>
<v Speaker 2>vitamin C was enough to prevent scurvy,</v>

1176
00:53:21.950 --> 00:53:24.740
<v Speaker 2>which can happen when you're basically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have enough vitamin C for,</v>

1177
00:53:24.870 --> 00:53:27.370
<v Speaker 2>for college and production.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1178
00:53:27.380 --> 00:53:28.213
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and even that's kind of questionable </v>

1179
00:53:29.311 --> 00:53:31.560
<v Speaker 2>because back at the time when those </v>
<v Speaker 2>studies were done,</v>

1180
00:53:31.561 --> 00:53:35.580
<v Speaker 2>it was before really good analytical </v>
<v Speaker 2>essays were available.</v>

1181
00:53:35.581 --> 00:53:36.414
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1182
00:53:36.420 --> 00:53:38.830
<v Speaker 2>the asset that was done to measure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1183
00:53:39.210 --> 00:53:42.690
<v Speaker 2>various things were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was lots of things could confound,</v>

1184
00:53:42.691 --> 00:53:45.450
<v Speaker 2>so it may even be less,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe more,</v>

1185
00:53:45.451 --> 00:53:46.470
<v Speaker 2>maybe less.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of not known.</v>

1186
00:53:47.040 --> 00:53:47.970
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1187
00:53:48.920 --> 00:53:49.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1188
00:53:49.560 --> 00:53:51.960
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is something to consider as well as</v>

1189
00:53:51.961 --> 00:53:52.794
<v Speaker 2>the fact that basically there's a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>biological variation with vitamin C </v>

1190
00:53:56.071 --> 00:53:56.904
<v Speaker 2>requirements and this has been shown in </v>
<v Speaker 2>other animals that also require vitamin </v>

1191
00:54:00.170 --> 00:54:01.170
<v Speaker 2>C,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Guinea pigs.</v>

1192
00:54:01.590 --> 00:54:05.340
<v Speaker 2>So like if you take 100 Guinea pigs and </v>
<v Speaker 2>this is published back in the sixties or</v>

1193
00:54:05.341 --> 00:54:06.800
<v Speaker 2>seventies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1194
00:54:07.140 --> 00:54:10.890
<v Speaker 2>like there was like 10 fold variation in</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much each of them required vitamin C</v>

1195
00:54:10.891 --> 00:54:12.570
<v Speaker 2>they required even though they were </v>
<v Speaker 2>given like,</v>

1196
00:54:12.600 --> 00:54:13.050
<v Speaker 2>wow.</v>

1197
00:54:13.050 --> 00:54:14.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So tenfold.</v>

1198
00:54:14.910 --> 00:54:15.870
<v Speaker 2>Tenfold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1199
00:54:15.871 --> 00:54:16.704
<v Speaker 2>So there's huge variation in the half </v>
<v Speaker 2>life of vitamin C and in their </v>

1200
00:54:19.981 --> 00:54:23.130
<v Speaker 2>transporters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so this has been shown in rodents as</v>

1201
00:54:23.131 --> 00:54:24.930
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rodin's make vitamin C and their liver.</v>

1202
00:54:24.931 --> 00:54:28.770
<v Speaker 2>But the same thing has been shown.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And actually back when this,</v>

1203
00:54:28.960 --> 00:54:32.220
<v Speaker 2>the European sailors were getting scurvy</v>
<v Speaker 2>and dying of it,</v>

1204
00:54:32.280 --> 00:54:33.113
<v Speaker 2>only about 50 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Only about half of those dealers got </v>

1205
00:54:35.370 --> 00:54:36.203
<v Speaker 2>scurvy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other 50 percent didn't have any </v>

1206
00:54:37.171 --> 00:54:40.680
<v Speaker 2>symptoms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>presumably because not getting scurvy.</v>

1207
00:54:41.160 --> 00:54:42.690
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying that,</v>

1208
00:54:42.980 --> 00:54:45.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for one it doesn't take much.</v>

1209
00:54:45.670 --> 00:54:47.580
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or getting some of it from me.</v>

1210
00:54:47.930 --> 00:54:48.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1211
00:54:48.660 --> 00:54:49.770
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the thing,</v>

1212
00:54:50.700 --> 00:54:51.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1213
00:54:51.621 --> 00:54:53.000
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't take much to,</v>

1214
00:54:53.060 --> 00:54:57.790
<v Speaker 2>to maintain the enzymatic function of </v>
<v Speaker 2>some of the,</v>

1215
00:54:57.900 --> 00:55:00.480
<v Speaker 2>some of the enzymes involved in making </v>
<v Speaker 2>Collagen and that,</v>

1216
00:55:00.481 --> 00:55:02.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it doesn't take much for that.</v>

1217
00:55:02.400 --> 00:55:05.320
<v Speaker 2>But the question is about what about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1218
00:55:05.550 --> 00:55:09.020
<v Speaker 2>all the host of all the factors and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>neutrophils and um,</v>

1219
00:55:09.120 --> 00:55:09.953
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your body stores like orders of </v>

1220
00:55:11.911 --> 00:55:15.000
<v Speaker 2>magnitude more vitamin C than then than </v>
<v Speaker 2>it needs for that,</v>

1221
00:55:15.001 --> 00:55:16.800
<v Speaker 2>for the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for its function as a cofactor.</v>

1222
00:55:17.130 --> 00:55:17.963
<v Speaker 2>And it's like why does it do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it just because maybe during scarce </v>

1223
00:55:20.580 --> 00:55:23.300
<v Speaker 2>food scarcity you want and wants to make</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure it has enough or is there are,</v>

1224
00:55:23.610 --> 00:55:24.443
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the antioxidant functions and other </v>

1225
00:55:25.231 --> 00:55:27.900
<v Speaker 2>functions really important or other </v>
<v Speaker 2>unknown functions.</v>

1226
00:55:28.260 --> 00:55:30.090
<v Speaker 2>So I think the vitamin C,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1227
00:55:30.350 --> 00:55:31.830
<v Speaker 2>there are certainly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1228
00:55:31.860 --> 00:55:32.693
<v Speaker 2>getting enough to prevent scurvy and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there could be biological variation in </v>

1229
00:55:36.151 --> 00:55:37.170
<v Speaker 2>that as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1230
00:55:37.380 --> 00:55:39.590
<v Speaker 2>You don't need much to prevent scurvy in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the junior.</v>

1231
00:55:39.600 --> 00:55:41.340
<v Speaker 2>You're dealing with a very small sample </v>
<v Speaker 2>size.</v>

1232
00:55:41.341 --> 00:55:44.070
<v Speaker 2>You don't know how many people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually on this or supplementing,</v>

1233
00:55:44.480 --> 00:55:45.313
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many of them are supplementing and </v>

1234
00:55:46.381 --> 00:55:48.120
<v Speaker 2>why wouldn't they be right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1235
00:55:48.300 --> 00:55:49.790
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1236
00:55:50.040 --> 00:55:50.873
<v Speaker 2>when you think that a lot of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>issues could be prevented with just </v>

1237
00:55:52.740 --> 00:55:55.500
<v Speaker 2>multivitamin and supplementation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1238
00:55:55.501 --> 00:55:58.290
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the best thing is to get it from</v>

1239
00:55:58.291 --> 00:55:59.190
<v Speaker 2>food and we'll talk through it.</v>

1240
00:55:59.200 --> 00:56:00.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1241
00:56:00.960 --> 00:56:01.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the,</v>

1242
00:56:01.580 --> 00:56:02.413
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's another one that's potentially </v>

1243
00:56:03.331 --> 00:56:04.164
<v Speaker 2>risky and that is vitamin E,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which kind of vitamin D helps recycle </v>

1244
00:56:07.831 --> 00:56:11.730
<v Speaker 2>vitamin C and vitamin C helps recycle </v>
<v Speaker 2>vitamin E and vitamin e actually,</v>

1245
00:56:12.140 --> 00:56:13.980
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most people think of as an antioxidant,</v>

1246
00:56:13.981 --> 00:56:17.610
<v Speaker 2>which it does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it prevents a lot of oxidative chains.</v>

1247
00:56:17.630 --> 00:56:19.350
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of breaks the chain of </v>
<v Speaker 2>oxidation,</v>

1248
00:56:19.680 --> 00:56:22.380
<v Speaker 2>but also is really important for </v>
<v Speaker 2>maintaining cell integrity.</v>

1249
00:56:22.650 --> 00:56:25.210
<v Speaker 2>And that's how the Rda was chosen for </v>
<v Speaker 2>that one.</v>

1250
00:56:25.540 --> 00:56:26.373
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1251
00:56:26.500 --> 00:56:27.333
<v Speaker 2>how does it do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's important for inside the cell </v>

1252
00:56:29.711 --> 00:56:30.580
<v Speaker 2>membrane,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's,</v>

1253
00:56:30.581 --> 00:56:31.414
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's important antioxidant inside the </v>

1254
00:56:32.051 --> 00:56:32.884
<v Speaker 2>cell membrane and so it's preventing a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of oxidative factors that are </v>

1255
00:56:36.011 --> 00:56:38.050
<v Speaker 2>happening just from normal metabolism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>normal,</v>

1256
00:56:38.440 --> 00:56:40.210
<v Speaker 2>what's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You and I are doing it right now,</v>

1257
00:56:40.560 --> 00:56:45.280
<v Speaker 2>a DNA damage that damage our DNA.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It also damages the Lipitz in our,</v>

1258
00:56:45.310 --> 00:56:46.480
<v Speaker 2>in our cell membranes.</v>

1259
00:56:46.810 --> 00:56:48.260
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so vitamin E,</v>

1260
00:56:48.310 --> 00:56:51.220
<v Speaker 2>it plays a really important role in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>integrity of it.</v>

1261
00:56:51.640 --> 00:56:52.630
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1262
00:56:52.930 --> 00:56:56.380
<v Speaker 2>the experiments that were done for </v>
<v Speaker 2>choosing the RDA for vitamin E,</v>

1263
00:56:56.800 --> 00:56:57.633
<v Speaker 2>we're two and a half years long and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>men were given three milligrams of </v>

1264
00:57:02.021 --> 00:57:04.870
<v Speaker 2>vitamin E,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the RDA is 15 milligrams.</v>

1265
00:57:04.871 --> 00:57:05.704
<v Speaker 2>So they were given three and after two </v>
<v Speaker 2>and a half years they started getting </v>

1266
00:57:08.801 --> 00:57:11.710
<v Speaker 2>hemolysis of the red blood cells because</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're red blood cell.</v>

1267
00:57:12.100 --> 00:57:12.933
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the membranes of the red blood cells </v>

1268
00:57:14.231 --> 00:57:15.064
<v Speaker 2>weren't being maintained very well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>After two and a half it took two and a </v>

1269
00:57:17.561 --> 00:57:19.390
<v Speaker 2>half years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a long time for,</v>

1270
00:57:19.460 --> 00:57:20.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for this to show up.</v>

1271
00:57:21.280 --> 00:57:22.113
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1272
00:57:22.150 --> 00:57:22.983
<v Speaker 2>for whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was decided that having hemo license </v>

1273
00:57:25.121 --> 00:57:28.600
<v Speaker 2>happen lower than 12 percent is okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>12 percent was the cutoff.</v>

1274
00:57:28.960 --> 00:57:30.790
<v Speaker 2>And so they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they did the depletion studies,</v>

1275
00:57:30.791 --> 00:57:31.624
<v Speaker 2>it was 15,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was actually 12 milligrams and then </v>

1276
00:57:33.220 --> 00:57:36.240
<v Speaker 2>for the ear and they went up two </v>
<v Speaker 2>standard deviations and found 15.</v>

1277
00:57:37.090 --> 00:57:40.840
<v Speaker 2>Basically the RDA was at 15.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the question becomes,</v>

1278
00:57:40.841 --> 00:57:42.940
<v Speaker 2>well right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so vitamin D you can,</v>

1279
00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:43.833
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can get some vitamin E if you're </v>

1280
00:57:44.900 --> 00:57:45.733
<v Speaker 2>eating some egg yolks and butter and if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're eating some fish but you're not </v>

1281
00:57:48.011 --> 00:57:48.844
<v Speaker 2>going to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really hard to get 15 milligrams </v>

1282
00:57:50.411 --> 00:57:51.670
<v Speaker 2>from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from those sources.</v>

1283
00:57:51.671 --> 00:57:53.020
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then if you're eating that,</v>

1284
00:57:53.021 --> 00:57:55.390
<v Speaker 2>what about all the other stuff you have </v>
<v Speaker 2>to eat to get your other,</v>

1285
00:57:55.391 --> 00:57:56.224
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it is a good source of nuts are </v>

1286
00:57:58.151 --> 00:57:59.560
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really the best source.</v>

1287
00:57:59.561 --> 00:58:01.090
<v Speaker 2>Like almonds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like 100 grand,</v>

1288
00:58:01.400 --> 00:58:03.430
<v Speaker 2>100 grams of almonds with like give you </v>
<v Speaker 2>your rda.</v>

1289
00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:05.830
<v Speaker 2>Really good source.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1290
00:58:06.640 --> 00:58:07.860
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1291
00:58:08.440 --> 00:58:09.700
<v Speaker 2>so the question becomes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1292
00:58:09.701 --> 00:58:10.970
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1293
00:58:12.040 --> 00:58:14.410
<v Speaker 2>what happens if I'm only getting seven </v>
<v Speaker 2>milligrams a day,</v>

1294
00:58:14.560 --> 00:58:16.060
<v Speaker 2>is it going to take,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1295
00:58:16.290 --> 00:58:17.123
<v Speaker 2>six or seven or eight years before my </v>
<v Speaker 2>cell membrane integrity is compromised </v>

1296
00:58:20.411 --> 00:58:21.550
<v Speaker 2>more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1297
00:58:21.551 --> 00:58:22.900
<v Speaker 2>what you know.</v>

1298
00:58:22.900 --> 00:58:23.733
<v Speaker 2>So it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of important questions to </v>

1299
00:58:25.271 --> 00:58:26.470
<v Speaker 2>think about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1300
00:58:26.471 --> 00:58:27.304
<v Speaker 2>and it's like these rdas I would even </v>
<v Speaker 2>argue they're set too low in some cases </v>

1301
00:58:32.801 --> 00:58:33.634
<v Speaker 2>where you're really trying to just </v>
<v Speaker 2>prevent things like that are like </v>

1302
00:58:36.491 --> 00:58:38.020
<v Speaker 2>hemolysis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lysis of the red blood cells.</v>

1303
00:58:38.021 --> 00:58:40.510
<v Speaker 2>And so what about all these other </v>
<v Speaker 2>longterm effects?</v>

1304
00:58:40.900 --> 00:58:41.960
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1305
00:58:41.980 --> 00:58:43.960
<v Speaker 2>enzymes that are involved in DNA repair </v>
<v Speaker 2>for example.</v>

1306
00:58:43.961 --> 00:58:46.780
<v Speaker 2>And another one would be like fully a </v>
<v Speaker 2>full eight.</v>

1307
00:58:46.781 --> 00:58:47.614
<v Speaker 2>You can get if you eat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're eating like 150 grams of </v>

1308
00:58:50.650 --> 00:58:53.740
<v Speaker 2>cooked beef liver every day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like who does that?</v>

1309
00:58:53.770 --> 00:58:54.371
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1310
00:58:54.371 --> 00:58:55.660
<v Speaker 2>and if you're not doing that and you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>eating,</v>

1311
00:58:55.661 --> 00:58:58.720
<v Speaker 2>you got to eat like you're 48 starting </v>
<v Speaker 2>to get your vitamin E and you've got,</v>

1312
00:58:58.721 --> 00:58:59.554
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's like,</v>

1313
00:58:59.620 --> 00:59:02.170
<v Speaker 2>it's not easy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm not saying you can't get,</v>

1314
00:59:02.770 --> 00:59:04.840
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some amounts of it,</v>

1315
00:59:04.841 --> 00:59:06.490
<v Speaker 2>but you may not be getting the RDA.</v>

1316
00:59:06.850 --> 00:59:10.870
<v Speaker 2>And so foliate plays a very important </v>
<v Speaker 2>role in actually making new DNA,</v>

1317
00:59:11.530 --> 00:59:13.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you don't have full eight,</v>

1318
00:59:13.361 --> 00:59:14.194
<v Speaker 2>you essentially incorporate something </v>
<v Speaker 2>from rna called Eurocell into DNA and </v>

1319
00:59:17.681 --> 00:59:18.514
<v Speaker 2>all your like Dna polymerases and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're cruising along and see and then </v>

1320
00:59:21.761 --> 00:59:24.240
<v Speaker 2>make a nick in the DNA and it literally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1321
00:59:24.330 --> 00:59:25.340
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a nick,</v>

1322
00:59:25.370 --> 00:59:26.270
<v Speaker 2>it's like uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in your,</v>

1323
00:59:26.271 --> 00:59:27.920
<v Speaker 2>in your DNA.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you have it,</v>

1324
00:59:28.340 --> 00:59:29.440
<v Speaker 2>DNA is double stranded.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1325
00:59:29.450 --> 00:59:31.160
<v Speaker 2>we have it on two ends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the DNA,</v>

1326
00:59:31.161 --> 00:59:31.994
<v Speaker 2>what you do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's really important to make </v>

1327
00:59:32.841 --> 00:59:35.590
<v Speaker 2>one of the nucleotides timing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you know,</v>

1328
00:59:35.600 --> 00:59:36.860
<v Speaker 2>you're going to have a double stranded </v>
<v Speaker 2>break.</v>

1329
00:59:37.160 --> 00:59:39.350
<v Speaker 2>And actually my former postdoctoral </v>
<v Speaker 2>mentor,</v>

1330
00:59:39.351 --> 00:59:40.184
<v Speaker 2>Dr Bruce Ames,</v>
<v Speaker 2>published a study showing that if you </v>

1331
00:59:42.201 --> 00:59:43.034
<v Speaker 2>take animals and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make them deficient in full eight or </v>

1332
00:59:45.801 --> 00:59:47.480
<v Speaker 2>give them really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really low levels of full late,</v>

1333
00:59:47.660 --> 00:59:50.570
<v Speaker 2>it causes strands and their dna just </v>
<v Speaker 2>like being irradiated.</v>

1334
00:59:50.570 --> 00:59:53.090
<v Speaker 2>Like he compared them side by side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was east exact same thing.</v>

1335
00:59:53.450 --> 00:59:58.450
<v Speaker 2>And then he published a study that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>with humans showing that actually humans</v>

1336
00:59:58.791 --> 01:00:03.260
<v Speaker 2>that are getting really low levels of </v>
<v Speaker 2>full late also had a certain type of DNA</v>

1337
01:00:03.261 --> 01:00:05.990
<v Speaker 2>damage called micro nuclei.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know.</v>

1338
01:00:05.991 --> 01:00:07.130
<v Speaker 2>So the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1339
01:00:08.210 --> 01:00:09.350
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I,</v>

1340
01:00:09.351 --> 01:00:11.780
<v Speaker 2>if I'm getting only so much fully,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1341
01:00:11.781 --> 01:00:14.830
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it something happening to my dna,</v>

1342
01:00:14.850 --> 01:00:16.940
<v Speaker 2>my getting strand breaks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The same goes for magnesium.</v>

1343
01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:19.640
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can get magnesium if you're eating,</v>

1344
01:00:19.641 --> 01:00:20.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

1345
01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:21.850
<v Speaker 2>it's just been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what about the day?</v>

1346
01:00:21.860 --> 01:00:23.630
<v Speaker 2>And then what about the bottom e?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

1347
01:00:23.631 --> 01:00:26.840
<v Speaker 2>so it's really hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really hard,</v>

1348
01:00:27.340 --> 01:00:28.120
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

1349
01:00:28.120 --> 01:00:30.500
<v Speaker 2>to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Dna damage,</v>

1350
01:00:30.590 --> 01:00:32.660
<v Speaker 2>that's something you can't measure it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to go.</v>

1351
01:00:32.661 --> 01:00:36.140
<v Speaker 2>Your Lipid panel isn't going to tell you</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there's no consumer test available.</v>

1352
01:00:36.140 --> 01:00:39.710
<v Speaker 2>There was a few years ago with a startup</v>
<v Speaker 2>tried doing it,</v>

1353
01:00:39.711 --> 01:00:44.711
<v Speaker 2>but it's really hard because there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're sending blood samples to a lab</v>

1354
01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:47.833
<v Speaker 2>to be tested for DNA damage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have done many dna damage experiments </v>

1355
01:00:50.481 --> 01:00:52.250
<v Speaker 2>on humans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So clinical studies.</v>

1356
01:00:52.251 --> 01:00:54.560
<v Speaker 2>I was involved in Dr Ames lab.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1357
01:00:54.630 --> 01:00:55.463
<v Speaker 2>and I've done studies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kinetic studies where we took blood out </v>

1358
01:00:57.831 --> 01:01:01.730
<v Speaker 2>of a patient measure DNA damage </v>
<v Speaker 2>immediately or frozen down,</v>

1359
01:01:01.731 --> 01:01:03.560
<v Speaker 2>or we let it sit on a bench for 30 </v>
<v Speaker 2>minutes,</v>

1360
01:01:03.561 --> 01:01:05.990
<v Speaker 2>two hours,</v>
<v Speaker 2>four hours overnight after two hours,</v>

1361
01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:06.913
<v Speaker 2>all the tons of DNA damage that had come</v>
<v Speaker 2>up because it's being exposed to the </v>

1362
01:01:09.920 --> 01:01:13.310
<v Speaker 2>oxygen and all that is I'm creating </v>
<v Speaker 2>basically DNA damage.</v>

1363
01:01:13.311 --> 01:01:14.840
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the point is,</v>

1364
01:01:14.841 --> 01:01:17.630
<v Speaker 2>is that DNA damage isn't something </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to measure.</v>

1365
01:01:18.020 --> 01:01:20.840
<v Speaker 2>You don't feel it and you're not going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to feel it.</v>

1366
01:01:20.841 --> 01:01:22.520
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's happening in us right now.</v>

1367
01:01:22.550 --> 01:01:24.050
<v Speaker 2>We don't know how many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it is.</v>

1368
01:01:24.470 --> 01:01:25.303
<v Speaker 2>We have enzymes that are repairing that </v>
<v Speaker 2>damage and those enzymes require </v>

1369
01:01:27.501 --> 01:01:30.740
<v Speaker 2>magnesium.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're getting enough folate to make sure</v>

1370
01:01:30.741 --> 01:01:32.570
<v Speaker 2>that that damage isn't happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>

1371
01:01:32.571 --> 01:01:33.404
<v Speaker 2>you can get a good amount of full liver </v>
<v Speaker 2>is one of the best is really great </v>

1372
01:01:36.021 --> 01:01:37.760
<v Speaker 2>source,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you have to eat it every day and you</v>

1373
01:01:37.761 --> 01:01:38.900
<v Speaker 2>have to like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1374
01:01:39.470 --> 01:01:41.600
<v Speaker 2>I guess 150 grams of livers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not that much,</v>

1375
01:01:41.601 --> 01:01:43.760
<v Speaker 2>but you have to eat it every day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

1376
01:01:43.910 --> 01:01:45.290
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's,</v>

1377
01:01:45.320 --> 01:01:47.390
<v Speaker 2>it's just really important to consider </v>
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>

1378
01:01:47.950 --> 01:01:48.783
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fact that these micronutrients are </v>

1379
01:01:49.731 --> 01:01:51.290
<v Speaker 2>important,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have longterm effects.</v>

1380
01:01:51.291 --> 01:01:52.124
<v Speaker 2>I mean the two and a half years it took </v>
<v Speaker 2>to show the hemo license and red blood </v>

1381
01:01:55.341 --> 01:01:56.174
<v Speaker 2>cells two and a half years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what happens if you're getting a </v>

1382
01:01:58.431 --> 01:02:00.380
<v Speaker 2>modest amount,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not quite three milligrams,</v>

1383
01:02:00.381 --> 01:02:02.870
<v Speaker 2>but you're getting twice that or maybe </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're getting nine,</v>

1384
01:02:03.080 --> 01:02:04.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what happens seven years from now,</v>

1385
01:02:05.030 --> 01:02:06.940
<v Speaker 2>like you don't know it's in.</v>

1386
01:02:06.950 --> 01:02:09.050
<v Speaker 2>It's important that your health is </v>
<v Speaker 2>important.</v>

1387
01:02:09.620 --> 01:02:11.480
<v Speaker 2>So I think that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So those,</v>

1388
01:02:11.481 --> 01:02:13.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's a variety of other magazines</v>

1389
01:02:13.910 --> 01:02:18.230
<v Speaker 2>you can also get if you're eating a lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>of like a stomach lining tripe.</v>

1390
01:02:18.890 --> 01:02:19.950
<v Speaker 2>So it's called [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1391
01:02:20.220 --> 01:02:21.810
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's not like you can't get it,</v>

1392
01:02:22.230 --> 01:02:23.063
<v Speaker 2>but they're not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most of these people that are carnivore </v>

1393
01:02:24.211 --> 01:02:26.130
<v Speaker 2>diet or just eating beef,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1394
01:02:26.190 --> 01:02:27.023
<v Speaker 2>Especially if the people are working a </v>
<v Speaker 2>job where they go in to an office nine </v>

1395
01:02:30.631 --> 01:02:33.900
<v Speaker 2>to five or they're traveling and it's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>really hard to eat all this cool.</v>

1396
01:02:33.990 --> 01:02:34.471
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1397
01:02:34.471 --> 01:02:37.260
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the inuits were eating things like raw,</v>

1398
01:02:37.290 --> 01:02:39.050
<v Speaker 2>like they were eating raw liver,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Raul,</v>

1399
01:02:39.100 --> 01:02:42.750
<v Speaker 2>like raw whale blubber and spleen </v>
<v Speaker 2>spleen's a good source.</v>

1400
01:02:42.751 --> 01:02:44.640
<v Speaker 2>I mean you can get vitamin C from </v>
<v Speaker 2>spleen,</v>

1401
01:02:45.300 --> 01:02:47.820
<v Speaker 2>I think heart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's some organs,</v>

1402
01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:51.900
<v Speaker 2>vitamin C when you cook it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>25 percent of it's lost.</v>

1403
01:02:52.290 --> 01:02:54.420
<v Speaker 2>So that's why a lot of the muscle meat </v>
<v Speaker 2>and stuff,</v>

1404
01:02:54.810 --> 01:02:56.940
<v Speaker 2>it does start out with vitamin C,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when you cook it,</v>

1405
01:02:57.310 --> 01:03:00.650
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you're not eating it raw,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you're definitely,</v>

1406
01:03:00.651 --> 01:03:01.530
<v Speaker 2>it's negligible.</v>

1407
01:03:02.040 --> 01:03:02.873
<v Speaker 4>One young guy who is a carnivore diet </v>
<v Speaker 4>proponent that seems to be approaching </v>

1408
01:03:06.571 --> 01:03:07.404
<v Speaker 4>this in a much more comprehensive way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's really big on organ meats in </v>

1409
01:03:10.471 --> 01:03:12.360
<v Speaker 4>particular,</v>
<v Speaker 4>liver and many other things.</v>

1410
01:03:12.361 --> 01:03:15.780
<v Speaker 4>And he's talking about how these organ </v>
<v Speaker 4>meats,</v>

1411
01:03:15.810 --> 01:03:16.850
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>will,</v>

1412
01:03:16.851 --> 01:03:17.684
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>be excellent sources of a lot of the </v>

1413
01:03:20.250 --> 01:03:23.040
<v Speaker 4>vitamins that people are concerned that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're missing from vegetables.</v>

1414
01:03:23.430 --> 01:03:26.340
<v Speaker 4>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you think that that is possible?</v>

1415
01:03:26.341 --> 01:03:29.400
<v Speaker 4>And it means spleen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess for vitamin C.</v>

1416
01:03:29.940 --> 01:03:31.600
<v Speaker 4>But like what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1417
01:03:31.670 --> 01:03:35.280
<v Speaker 4>what about just liver or kidneys or </v>
<v Speaker 4>things along those lines?</v>

1418
01:03:35.281 --> 01:03:37.500
<v Speaker 4>Mean what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what are you going to be deficient in?</v>

1419
01:03:37.501 --> 01:03:39.150
<v Speaker 4>If you go the organ meat route,</v>

1420
01:03:39.740 --> 01:03:41.060
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1421
01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:45.770
<v Speaker 2>if you're the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the magnesium and um,</v>

1422
01:03:46.870 --> 01:03:47.703
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the magazine won't be in while you're </v>

1423
01:03:48.171 --> 01:03:49.270
<v Speaker 2>out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you give me another one who's.</v>

1424
01:03:49.680 --> 01:03:52.820
<v Speaker 2>Thanks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm magnesium,</v>

1425
01:03:52.821 --> 01:03:54.590
<v Speaker 2>but you can get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>

1426
01:03:54.740 --> 01:03:56.750
<v Speaker 2>you can do it right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you can do it,</v>

1427
01:03:57.140 --> 01:03:57.973
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems very difficult and I don't </v>

1428
01:04:00.321 --> 01:04:02.870
<v Speaker 2>think most people will do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you recommend of course,</v>

1429
01:04:02.871 --> 01:04:06.320
<v Speaker 2>getting all this stuff from food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you were going to get magnesium,</v>

1430
01:04:07.450 --> 01:04:08.400
<v Speaker 2>but it did.</v>

1431
01:04:08.750 --> 01:04:13.630
<v Speaker 4>Is it feasible that you could just </v>
<v Speaker 4>supplement with multivitamins and,</v>

1432
01:04:13.940 --> 01:04:15.960
<v Speaker 2>and cover all your bases?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

1433
01:04:16.130 --> 01:04:18.590
<v Speaker 2>I think the same goes for Vegetarians.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they should,</v>

1434
01:04:18.970 --> 01:04:21.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they do supplement and they take the 12,</v>

1435
01:04:21.870 --> 01:04:24.050
<v Speaker 2>they take iron,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which isn't necessarily.</v>

1436
01:04:24.051 --> 01:04:27.530
<v Speaker 2>I think it's much better to take iron,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get iron from food.</v>

1437
01:04:27.620 --> 01:04:31.400
<v Speaker 2>It's not as bioavailable in a pill form.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Also,</v>

1438
01:04:31.430 --> 01:04:32.263
<v Speaker 2>the Bible belt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the pill form has been shown to disrupt </v>

1439
01:04:34.431 --> 01:04:35.264
<v Speaker 2>other things like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whereas iron from food isn't just </v>

1440
01:04:39.111 --> 01:04:40.790
<v Speaker 2>depends on the ratios of other things </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1441
01:04:40.820 --> 01:04:42.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>disrupting,</v>

1442
01:04:42.620 --> 01:04:43.453
<v Speaker 2>disrupting the transport of other </v>
<v Speaker 2>transition elements and things like </v>

1443
01:04:46.221 --> 01:04:47.990
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's isolated also.</v>

1444
01:04:48.110 --> 01:04:49.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something about that.</v>

1445
01:04:49.101 --> 01:04:52.430
<v Speaker 2>Also there's bacteria in the gut that </v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1446
01:04:52.820 --> 01:04:55.460
<v Speaker 2>that can be pathogenic and that use </v>
<v Speaker 2>iron,</v>

1447
01:04:55.461 --> 01:04:57.980
<v Speaker 2>but it seems to be only in supplemental </v>
<v Speaker 2>form that that's.</v>

1448
01:04:58.150 --> 01:04:58.983
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying you should never </v>
<v Speaker 2>supplement supplement iron throughout </v>

1449
01:05:00.711 --> 01:05:01.544
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1450
01:05:01.670 --> 01:05:02.503
<v Speaker 2>third trimester,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I just think that you're going to </v>

1451
01:05:04.731 --> 01:05:07.030
<v Speaker 2>potentially run into more problems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1452
01:05:07.850 --> 01:05:08.830
<v Speaker 2>with that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1453
01:05:09.020 --> 01:05:11.390
<v Speaker 2>iron does it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It does come from bread,</v>

1454
01:05:11.391 --> 01:05:12.170
<v Speaker 2>meat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>correct.</v>

1455
01:05:12.170 --> 01:05:14.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean irons very bioavailable when it's</v>

1456
01:05:14.451 --> 01:05:18.310
<v Speaker 2>bound to hemoglobin and versus </v>
<v Speaker 2>vegetarians just ate red meat.</v>

1457
01:05:21.520 --> 01:05:22.240
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

1458
01:05:22.240 --> 01:05:22.961
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

1459
01:05:22.961 --> 01:05:23.794
<v Speaker 2>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there's a whole other host of </v>

1460
01:05:25.631 --> 01:05:27.890
<v Speaker 2>micronutrients that vegetarians are </v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

1461
01:05:28.180 --> 01:05:30.460
<v Speaker 2>but that's not what we're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think,</v>

1462
01:05:30.520 --> 01:05:31.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1463
01:05:32.020 --> 01:05:37.020
<v Speaker 2>there's also other important reasons to </v>
<v Speaker 2>eat the plants instead of doing just the</v>

1464
01:05:37.061 --> 01:05:39.400
<v Speaker 2>organ meat and also just doing the </v>
<v Speaker 2>supplements as well,</v>

1465
01:05:40.050 --> 01:05:42.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in some of those reasons have to do with</v>

1466
01:05:42.731 --> 01:05:44.740
<v Speaker 2>the fact that microbiome is really </v>
<v Speaker 2>important.</v>

1467
01:05:44.741 --> 01:05:45.770
<v Speaker 2>So you're getting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1468
01:05:45.910 --> 01:05:46.743
<v Speaker 2>the fermentable types of fiber that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>really important for growing all sorts </v>

1469
01:05:49.331 --> 01:05:50.164
<v Speaker 2>of commensal bacteria in the gut.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we don't know what's gonna happen </v>

1470
01:05:51.941 --> 01:05:53.060
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1471
01:05:53.170 --> 01:05:55.300
<v Speaker 2>someone that's only just eating meat </v>
<v Speaker 2>longterm,</v>

1472
01:05:55.960 --> 01:05:57.040
<v Speaker 2>particularly with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>

1473
01:05:57.041 --> 01:05:57.874
<v Speaker 2>the putrifactive bacteria and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's just a word future future </v>

1474
01:06:01.890 --> 01:06:02.710
<v Speaker 2>Fi.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1475
01:06:02.710 --> 01:06:06.880
<v Speaker 2>that's the Fed feathers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Putrifactive bacteria also that are like</v>

1476
01:06:07.480 --> 01:06:09.070
<v Speaker 2>on corpses and stuff.</v>

1477
01:06:09.280 --> 01:06:11.590
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's where I think the cadaveric comes</v>

1478
01:06:11.591 --> 01:06:13.910
<v Speaker 2>from the work they produce something </v>
<v Speaker 2>evergreen,</v>

1479
01:06:13.960 --> 01:06:15.580
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm thinking.</v>

1480
01:06:15.581 --> 01:06:20.410
<v Speaker 2>It must be where it should have a huge </v>
<v Speaker 2>chip and cadaveric mean.</v>

1481
01:06:20.880 --> 01:06:22.510
<v Speaker 2>Sounds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sounds like farts.</v>

1482
01:06:22.910 --> 01:06:24.430
<v Speaker 2>So I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they actually are.</v>

1483
01:06:24.431 --> 01:06:25.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they do the portrait.</v>

1484
01:06:25.650 --> 01:06:29.500
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a response with some of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the really nasty parts.</v>

1485
01:06:30.220 --> 01:06:31.330
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

1486
01:06:31.880 --> 01:06:33.640
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's another reason.</v>

1487
01:06:33.670 --> 01:06:35.470
<v Speaker 2>And then the other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the other important thing,</v>

1488
01:06:35.471 --> 01:06:37.660
<v Speaker 2>or the phytochemicals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1489
01:06:37.710 --> 01:06:38.543
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's these polyphenols and all these </v>

1490
01:06:41.501 --> 01:06:44.050
<v Speaker 2>things that are present in plant the </v>
<v Speaker 2>humans were,</v>

1491
01:06:44.110 --> 01:06:46.090
<v Speaker 2>we evolved eating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we evolved eating them,</v>

1492
01:06:46.350 --> 01:06:47.183
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

1493
01:06:47.230 --> 01:06:48.730
<v Speaker 2>so the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1494
01:06:49.660 --> 01:06:51.550
<v Speaker 2>it's during,</v>
<v Speaker 2>throughout human evolution,</v>

1495
01:06:51.551 --> 01:06:52.450
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>humans,</v>

1496
01:06:52.451 --> 01:06:56.470
<v Speaker 2>we're stressed on many levels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>

1497
01:06:56.560 --> 01:06:58.870
<v Speaker 2>they went through moments of food </v>
<v Speaker 2>scarcity where the fasting came in.</v>

1498
01:06:58.871 --> 01:07:00.370
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's important right now.</v>

1499
01:07:00.371 --> 01:07:03.340
<v Speaker 2>We don't have that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can get food all the time,</v>

1500
01:07:03.341 --> 01:07:04.174
<v Speaker 2>anytime,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1501
01:07:04.990 --> 01:07:06.970
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that was an important,</v>

1502
01:07:07.050 --> 01:07:08.390
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1503
01:07:08.680 --> 01:07:12.670
<v Speaker 2>stress that humans have evolved with </v>
<v Speaker 2>exercise aerobic exercise,</v>

1504
01:07:12.820 --> 01:07:13.840
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's another thing.</v>

1505
01:07:13.841 --> 01:07:14.580
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you had to,</v>

1506
01:07:14.580 --> 01:07:17.560
<v Speaker 2>you had to move to get food and run from</v>
<v Speaker 2>predators.</v>

1507
01:07:17.561 --> 01:07:18.394
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we,</v>

1508
01:07:18.430 --> 01:07:19.263
<v Speaker 2>we evolved exercising.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you can see so many people don't do </v>

1509
01:07:22.601 --> 01:07:27.070
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We also evolved eating plants and meat.</v>

1510
01:07:27.100 --> 01:07:28.120
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're omnivores.</v>

1511
01:07:28.300 --> 01:07:29.133
<v Speaker 2>So we have these basically all these </v>
<v Speaker 2>pathways that are activated when we eat </v>

1512
01:07:33.851 --> 01:07:37.160
<v Speaker 2>plants and from certain compounds in </v>
<v Speaker 2>plants into insect Antifa,</v>

1513
01:07:37.170 --> 01:07:38.340
<v Speaker 2>Eden's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their,</v>

1514
01:07:38.410 --> 01:07:39.670
<v Speaker 2>their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their implants.</v>

1515
01:07:39.940 --> 01:07:40.773
<v Speaker 2>And when humans eat them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they basically activate a variety of </v>

1516
01:07:43.271 --> 01:07:44.104
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really important stress response </v>

1517
01:07:45.461 --> 01:07:47.500
<v Speaker 2>pathways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of these pathways get activated by</v>

1518
01:07:47.501 --> 01:07:48.334
<v Speaker 2>exercise and fasting as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there is a lot of overlap between </v>

1519
01:07:51.011 --> 01:07:53.950
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I see a lot of people,</v>

1520
01:07:54.340 --> 01:07:55.090
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the,</v>

1521
01:07:55.090 --> 01:07:58.450
<v Speaker 2>on this carnivore diet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about how they're so bad for you</v>

1522
01:07:58.840 --> 01:08:03.280
<v Speaker 2>and if they would take the time to </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually read studies,</v>

1523
01:08:03.430 --> 01:08:04.263
<v Speaker 2>human studies where people are given a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of these insect antifa didn't </v>

1524
01:08:06.761 --> 01:08:10.050
<v Speaker 2>compounds things like I said thiocyanate</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Sulforaphane,</v>

1525
01:08:10.460 --> 01:08:13.720
<v Speaker 2>I'm curcumin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>resveratrol,</v>

1526
01:08:13.721 --> 01:08:16.100
<v Speaker 2>anthocyanins,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and just tons and tons of them,</v>

1527
01:08:16.760 --> 01:08:17.593
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would see that there's beneficial </v>

1528
01:08:18.531 --> 01:08:21.620
<v Speaker 2>effects that happen and there's a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>mechanism for why that is,</v>

1529
01:08:22.040 --> 01:08:24.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I mean the Sulforaphane is one that I</v>

1530
01:08:24.561 --> 01:08:25.394
<v Speaker 2>like to talk about and there are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's tons and tons of human </v>

1531
01:08:28.461 --> 01:08:32.900
<v Speaker 2>intervention data where people are given</v>
<v Speaker 2>either cruciferous vegetables or they're</v>

1532
01:08:32.901 --> 01:08:34.070
<v Speaker 2>given Broccoli sprouts.</v>

1533
01:08:34.100 --> 01:08:36.080
<v Speaker 2>Broccoli sprouts are really great </v>
<v Speaker 2>source,</v>

1534
01:08:36.260 --> 01:08:38.330
<v Speaker 2>cruciferous vegetables,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Broccoli,</v>

1535
01:08:38.870 --> 01:08:40.910
<v Speaker 2>cabbage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fermented cabbage,</v>

1536
01:08:41.920 --> 01:08:43.310
<v Speaker 2>Brussel sprouts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1537
01:08:43.311 --> 01:08:45.240
<v Speaker 2>all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Broccoli sprouts have like 10,</v>

1538
01:08:45.290 --> 01:08:46.123
<v Speaker 2>anywhere between 10 and 100 times more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of that work was done by Dr Jed </v>

1539
01:08:49.250 --> 01:08:49.671
<v Speaker 2>Fahy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>friend of mine,</v>

1540
01:08:49.671 --> 01:08:51.920
<v Speaker 2>he's at Johns Hopkins,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very great scientist,</v>

1541
01:08:51.921 --> 01:08:54.920
<v Speaker 2>as a lot of research on sulforaphane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

1542
01:08:54.921 --> 01:08:55.880
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1543
01:08:55.881 --> 01:08:58.440
<v Speaker 2>if you look at intervention trials,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were talking about air pollution,</v>

1544
01:08:58.450 --> 01:08:59.283
<v Speaker 2>like there's an intervention trial.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's more than one showing in humans </v>

1545
01:09:01.881 --> 01:09:05.540
<v Speaker 2>showing that if you give humans Broccoli</v>
<v Speaker 2>sprout extract for seven days,</v>

1546
01:09:05.541 --> 01:09:06.374
<v Speaker 2>they start to excrete benzene and </v>
<v Speaker 2>accurately and Benzenes in air </v>

1547
01:09:08.631 --> 01:09:11.390
<v Speaker 2>pollution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sixty percent on day one.</v>

1548
01:09:11.480 --> 01:09:13.100
<v Speaker 2>Like they started screening it in their </v>
<v Speaker 2>urine,</v>

1549
01:09:13.101 --> 01:09:13.934
<v Speaker 2>like you're getting rid of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's largely because sulforaphane </v>

1550
01:09:16.250 --> 01:09:17.083
<v Speaker 2>activates a variety of enzymes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one called phase two detoxification </v>

1551
01:09:21.291 --> 01:09:23.800
<v Speaker 2>enzymes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which are important for getting rid of a</v>

1552
01:09:24.050 --> 01:09:25.340
<v Speaker 2>potentially harmful compounds.</v>

1553
01:09:25.460 --> 01:09:28.370
<v Speaker 2>It inactivates phase one </v>
<v Speaker 2>biotransformation enzymes,</v>

1554
01:09:28.371 --> 01:09:32.990
<v Speaker 2>which are enzymes that are able to like </v>
<v Speaker 2>take a pro carcinogen and turn it into a</v>

1555
01:09:32.991 --> 01:09:34.550
<v Speaker 2>carcinogen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1556
01:09:34.551 --> 01:09:35.540
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1557
01:09:35.541 --> 01:09:37.700
<v Speaker 2>there's intervention trials in humans </v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's,</v>

1558
01:09:37.850 --> 01:09:38.683
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>men that were given Broccoli sprout </v>

1559
01:09:40.250 --> 01:09:42.470
<v Speaker 2>extract,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lowered their,</v>

1560
01:09:42.530 --> 01:09:45.410
<v Speaker 2>their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their biomarker for prostate cancer,</v>

1561
01:09:45.670 --> 01:09:46.430
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by,</v>

1562
01:09:46.430 --> 01:09:50.030
<v Speaker 2>by like 86 percent or lower the doubling</v>
<v Speaker 2>rate of about 86 percent.</v>

1563
01:09:50.390 --> 01:09:51.510
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so this is like,</v>

1564
01:09:51.620 --> 01:09:52.453
<v Speaker 2>this is important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's studies showing that humans </v>

1565
01:09:54.021 --> 01:09:54.831
<v Speaker 2>given,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

1566
01:09:54.831 --> 01:09:55.664
<v Speaker 2>two different studies showing that </v>
<v Speaker 2>humans given 300 grams of Brussel </v>

1567
01:09:57.601 --> 01:09:59.150
<v Speaker 2>sprouts a day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>

1568
01:09:59.151 --> 01:09:59.984
<v Speaker 2>they increase a really important </v>
<v Speaker 2>antioxidant in their plasma called </v>

1569
01:10:02.270 --> 01:10:03.103
<v Speaker 2>glutathione by like one point four fold </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they decreased oxidative DNA damage </v>

1570
01:10:08.421 --> 01:10:09.254
<v Speaker 2>in their blood cells.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dna damage like we were just talking </v>

1571
01:10:10.881 --> 01:10:11.714
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they decreased it like by 30 percent or </v>

1572
01:10:14.091 --> 01:10:16.220
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Two separate studies,</v>

1573
01:10:16.221 --> 01:10:19.070
<v Speaker 2>Brussel sprouts and I liked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see people like,</v>

1574
01:10:19.370 --> 01:10:22.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking about the carnivore diet and</v>

1575
01:10:22.311 --> 01:10:23.144
<v Speaker 2>how sulforaphane increases DNA damage </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they like referenced this in vitro </v>

1576
01:10:26.961 --> 01:10:31.100
<v Speaker 2>study where they dumped sulforaphane on </v>
<v Speaker 2>cultured cells in a dish.</v>

1577
01:10:31.340 --> 01:10:31.731
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1578
01:10:31.731 --> 01:10:34.430
<v Speaker 2>what else is going to do that shit </v>
<v Speaker 2>heterocyclic amines from the cooked meat</v>

1579
01:10:34.431 --> 01:10:36.350
<v Speaker 2>you're eating like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>

1580
01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:39.650
<v Speaker 2>So if you dump something at a high </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough concentration,</v>

1581
01:10:39.890 --> 01:10:41.270
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to fuck it up,</v>

1582
01:10:41.620 --> 01:10:42.453
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we're talking about humans </v>

1583
01:10:43.911 --> 01:10:44.744
<v Speaker 2>ingesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you were to exercise nonstop and not </v>

1584
01:10:46.401 --> 01:10:47.810
<v Speaker 2>rest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would be toxic.</v>

1585
01:10:47.930 --> 01:10:51.140
<v Speaker 2>If you were to fast and not stop,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would be toxic.</v>

1586
01:10:51.230 --> 01:10:52.070
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1587
01:10:52.071 --> 01:10:52.851
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

1588
01:10:52.851 --> 01:10:53.684
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so how some of these pathways are </v>

1589
01:10:54.861 --> 01:10:57.290
<v Speaker 2>working is that they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the dose that they're given,</v>

1590
01:10:57.530 --> 01:10:58.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eating,</v>

1591
01:10:58.080 --> 01:10:58.913
<v Speaker 2>it's almost impossible to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to eat the kind of dose that it would </v>

1592
01:11:02.151 --> 01:11:04.280
<v Speaker 2>take to cause severe damage and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

1593
01:11:04.281 --> 01:11:05.780
<v Speaker 2>what you would get sick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would know,</v>

1594
01:11:05.781 --> 01:11:06.614
<v Speaker 2>you'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute.</v>

1595
01:11:07.060 --> 01:11:07.893
<v Speaker 2>Like so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I mean I think that using that as an </v>

1596
01:11:10.221 --> 01:11:12.350
<v Speaker 2>excuse is really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1597
01:11:12.990 --> 01:11:14.550
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they should read the studies and there's</v>

1598
01:11:14.551 --> 01:11:15.480
<v Speaker 2>so many more studies.</v>

1599
01:11:15.660 --> 01:11:19.020
<v Speaker 2>It's been shown recently to increase </v>
<v Speaker 2>gludethyon in the brain.</v>

1600
01:11:19.170 --> 01:11:20.003
<v Speaker 2>Human intervention studies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>humans that were given sulforaphane </v>

1601
01:11:21.900 --> 01:11:24.510
<v Speaker 2>extract,</v>
<v Speaker 2>increase it in their plasma and in their</v>

1602
01:11:24.511 --> 01:11:26.750
<v Speaker 2>brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gludethyon was one of the major and Alex</v>

1603
01:11:26.750 --> 01:11:28.890
<v Speaker 2>in the brain plays a major role in </v>
<v Speaker 2>traumatic brain injury,</v>

1604
01:11:29.010 --> 01:11:31.860
<v Speaker 2>brain aging.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is important.</v>

1605
01:11:31.880 --> 01:11:33.900
<v Speaker 2>Like this is a possible therapeutic </v>
<v Speaker 2>intervention.</v>

1606
01:11:34.170 --> 01:11:35.003
<v Speaker 2>It's been shown in randomized placebo </v>
<v Speaker 2>controlled trials to improve autistic </v>

1607
01:11:37.381 --> 01:11:40.020
<v Speaker 2>symptoms and adolescents open label </v>
<v Speaker 2>trials.</v>

1608
01:11:40.110 --> 01:11:41.790
<v Speaker 2>It's been shown to improve autism in </v>
<v Speaker 2>children,</v>

1609
01:11:41.850 --> 01:11:42.990
<v Speaker 2>autistic symptoms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>children.</v>

1610
01:11:43.370 --> 01:11:44.203
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's just study after study after </v>

1611
01:11:45.511 --> 01:11:48.090
<v Speaker 2>study and I'm just talking about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>human ones and there's more,</v>

1612
01:11:48.330 --> 01:11:51.670
<v Speaker 2>there's also lots of animal studies </v>
<v Speaker 2>where they're feeding a mega doses and,</v>

1613
01:11:51.671 --> 01:11:54.600
<v Speaker 2>and there's positive benefits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's been studies,</v>

1614
01:11:54.980 --> 01:11:55.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>feeding,</v>

1615
01:11:55.831 --> 01:11:58.230
<v Speaker 2>feeding humans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>large doses like something equivalent to</v>

1616
01:11:58.231 --> 01:12:00.540
<v Speaker 2>like 70 or 100 grams of Broccoli </v>
<v Speaker 2>sprouts,</v>

1617
01:12:00.541 --> 01:12:03.320
<v Speaker 2>which have a lot more so for her fame </v>
<v Speaker 2>than like Brussels sprouts do.</v>

1618
01:12:04.230 --> 01:12:06.420
<v Speaker 2>And there was no toxic side effects in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the liver.</v>

1619
01:12:06.450 --> 01:12:09.300
<v Speaker 2>Thyroid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one concern people do have if you</v>

1620
01:12:09.301 --> 01:12:12.510
<v Speaker 2>have hyperthyroid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sulforaphane can compete with iodine for</v>

1621
01:12:12.511 --> 01:12:16.020
<v Speaker 2>transport into the thyroid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's usually an issue.</v>

1622
01:12:16.140 --> 01:12:17.970
<v Speaker 2>It certainly doesn't seem to be an issue</v>
<v Speaker 2>in healthy people,</v>

1623
01:12:17.971 --> 01:12:18.804
<v Speaker 2>but iodine is found in seafood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean their sources of iodine you can </v>

1624
01:12:24.211 --> 01:12:27.450
<v Speaker 2>eat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So maybe someone with hyperthyroid might</v>

1625
01:12:27.451 --> 01:12:28.950
<v Speaker 2>want to make sure they're not eating a </v>
<v Speaker 2>ton.</v>

1626
01:12:29.190 --> 01:12:32.440
<v Speaker 2>Like you're not like know Kale smoothie </v>
<v Speaker 2>after kills me with the other kids.</v>

1627
01:12:32.441 --> 01:12:33.274
<v Speaker 2>Don't be like me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1628
01:12:33.300 --> 01:12:34.133
<v Speaker 2>make sure you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just that you're having your Brussels </v>

1629
01:12:35.311 --> 01:12:37.440
<v Speaker 2>sprouts with your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with your elk meat or whatever.</v>

1630
01:12:37.441 --> 01:12:39.600
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a problem.</v>

1631
01:12:39.990 --> 01:12:42.110
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you know,</v>

1632
01:12:42.180 --> 01:12:43.290
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do get a little,</v>

1633
01:12:43.291 --> 01:12:44.250
<v Speaker 2>I see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see.</v>

1634
01:12:44.430 --> 01:12:46.530
<v Speaker 2>Like you mentioned Dr Sean Baker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

1635
01:12:46.531 --> 01:12:48.750
<v Speaker 2>he put out a video about like he </v>
<v Speaker 2>mentioned to me,</v>

1636
01:12:48.751 --> 01:12:51.840
<v Speaker 2>my name's talking about how I only talk </v>
<v Speaker 2>about in vitro data and I'm like,</v>

1637
01:12:52.440 --> 01:12:53.273
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go watch my video or my interview with </v>

1638
01:12:55.271 --> 01:12:57.690
<v Speaker 2>the expert at Johns Hopkins.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're talking about human studies.</v>

1639
01:12:57.990 --> 01:12:58.823
<v Speaker 2>The in vitro data is coming from what </v>
<v Speaker 2>the opposite that had the damaging </v>

1640
01:13:02.701 --> 01:13:05.080
<v Speaker 2>effects.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's in vitro dumping.</v>

1641
01:13:05.081 --> 01:13:05.910
<v Speaker 2>Get on the culture side.</v>

1642
01:13:05.910 --> 01:13:07.500
<v Speaker 4>Just two things going on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's one,</v>

1643
01:13:07.501 --> 01:13:09.960
<v Speaker 4>there's a real cursory examination of </v>
<v Speaker 4>data.</v>

1644
01:13:09.990 --> 01:13:13.590
<v Speaker 4>Were they in this confirmation bias and </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's the combination of the two of those</v>

1645
01:13:13.591 --> 01:13:14.424
<v Speaker 4>things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They find one thing that's sort of kind </v>

1646
01:13:16.321 --> 01:13:17.154
<v Speaker 4>of vaguely supports what they wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 4>support and then they run with it and </v>

1647
01:13:20.341 --> 01:13:22.020
<v Speaker 4>they talk about it as if they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>experts.</v>

1648
01:13:22.080 --> 01:13:23.250
<v Speaker 4>Very dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

1649
01:13:23.251 --> 01:13:24.084
<v Speaker 4>And this is one of the reasons why I'm </v>
<v Speaker 4>so happy that you're talking about this </v>

1650
01:13:26.990 --> 01:13:27.823
<v Speaker 4>because you can give people a real </v>
<v Speaker 4>comprehensive understanding of all the </v>

1651
01:13:31.801 --> 01:13:32.634
<v Speaker 4>different things at play.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And one of the things that I get from </v>

1652
01:13:34.081 --> 01:13:39.081
<v Speaker 4>you when I talked to you about nutrition</v>
<v Speaker 4>is it's mind boggling how many different</v>

1653
01:13:40.681 --> 01:13:41.514
<v Speaker 4>factors are going on simultaneously in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the human body when it comes to </v>

1654
01:13:45.541 --> 01:13:48.260
<v Speaker 4>nutrition absorption,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when,</v>

1655
01:13:48.300 --> 01:13:48.870
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1656
01:13:48.870 --> 01:13:49.703
<v Speaker 4>in the various stages of the body and </v>
<v Speaker 4>how it can vary with different people </v>

1657
01:13:55.290 --> 01:13:56.123
<v Speaker 4>when there's so much going on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So when someone just starts talking </v>

1658
01:13:59.731 --> 01:14:01.320
<v Speaker 4>about vegetables are toxic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1659
01:14:01.321 --> 01:14:02.490
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jesus Christ,</v>

1660
01:14:03.640 --> 01:14:04.473
<v Speaker 2>read any of the study,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have you just go look at the scientific </v>

1661
01:14:06.791 --> 01:14:08.470
<v Speaker 2>data like on it to</v>

1662
01:14:08.470 --> 01:14:10.090
<v Speaker 4>be toxic?</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is what's crazy.</v>

1663
01:14:10.091 --> 01:14:10.924
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is an,</v>

1664
01:14:11.620 --> 01:14:14.020
<v Speaker 4>that's akin to veganism.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's really,</v>

1665
01:14:14.080 --> 01:14:14.970
<v Speaker 4>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a,</v>

1666
01:14:15.140 --> 01:14:20.140
<v Speaker 4>just another side of the same mindset.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's almost like a religious mindset.</v>

1667
01:14:21.140 --> 01:14:24.490
<v Speaker 4>They hashtag.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I did say it,</v>

1668
01:14:24.700 --> 01:14:26.140
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a fucking mediator.</v>

1669
01:14:27.270 --> 01:14:30.960
<v Speaker 4>You can't accuse me of being anti meat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I,</v>

1670
01:14:30.961 --> 01:14:35.590
<v Speaker 4>I side,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I eat more vegetables.</v>

1671
01:14:36.070 --> 01:14:38.950
<v Speaker 4>I think that I eat meat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I certainly.</v>

1672
01:14:38.951 --> 01:14:41.800
<v Speaker 4>It's certainly like right up there and </v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not giving them up.</v>

1673
01:14:41.801 --> 01:14:43.830
<v Speaker 4>I think that's stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just did.</v>

1674
01:14:43.850 --> 01:14:46.090
<v Speaker 4>Doesn't make any sense to me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I liked them.</v>

1675
01:14:46.690 --> 01:14:50.090
<v Speaker 4>There's this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's this weird push and the,</v>

1676
01:14:50.100 --> 01:14:53.050
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you look under Hashtag meet heels,</v>

1677
01:14:53.320 --> 01:14:54.153
<v Speaker 4>there's all these people telling these </v>
<v Speaker 4>stories about all the lost all this </v>

1678
01:14:56.471 --> 01:14:57.304
<v Speaker 4>weight and they did all this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this blah blah blah and the health </v>

1679
01:14:59.021 --> 01:14:59.870
<v Speaker 4>benefits and Dah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dah,</v>

1680
01:14:59.910 --> 01:15:00.221
<v Speaker 4>Dah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dah,</v>

1681
01:15:00.221 --> 01:15:00.490
<v Speaker 4>Dah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dah,</v>

1682
01:15:00.490 --> 01:15:01.090
<v Speaker 4>Dah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dah.</v>

1683
01:15:01.090 --> 01:15:01.923
<v Speaker 4>But they only want it to be because of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the consumption of meat only they think </v>

1684
01:15:06.731 --> 01:15:07.564
<v Speaker 4>that it's because of the singular aspect</v>
<v Speaker 4>of their diet and the fact that they've </v>

1685
01:15:10.901 --> 01:15:13.060
<v Speaker 4>eliminated everything else,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they're not,</v>

1686
01:15:13.360 --> 01:15:16.420
<v Speaker 4>they don't do any studying of </v>
<v Speaker 4>elimination diets.</v>

1687
01:15:16.421 --> 01:15:17.254
<v Speaker 4>They don't do any study of the prolonged</v>
<v Speaker 4>benefits of fasting and all these </v>

1688
01:15:20.621 --> 01:15:22.030
<v Speaker 4>different things that you're talking </v>
<v Speaker 4>about,</v>

1689
01:15:22.031 --> 01:15:22.864
<v Speaker 4>which I think are there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These are all factors in this really </v>

1690
01:15:26.921 --> 01:15:27.754
<v Speaker 4>complicated thing that's going on that </v>
<v Speaker 4>most likely has something to do with </v>

1691
01:15:31.511 --> 01:15:33.310
<v Speaker 4>their gut biome and their immune system.</v>

1692
01:15:33.380 --> 01:15:34.760
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

1693
01:15:34.940 --> 01:15:39.010
<v Speaker 2>I mean those are two major confounding </v>
<v Speaker 2>factors like,</v>

1694
01:15:39.140 --> 01:15:40.610
<v Speaker 2>so major,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1695
01:15:40.611 --> 01:15:43.850
<v Speaker 2>it's um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's important.</v>

1696
01:15:43.851 --> 01:15:47.390
<v Speaker 2>It's just important to approach this </v>
<v Speaker 2>like a science,</v>

1697
01:15:47.420 --> 01:15:48.253
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1698
01:15:48.280 --> 01:15:50.000
<v Speaker 2>and not like a religion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you said,</v>

1699
01:15:50.001 --> 01:15:52.130
<v Speaker 2>where you want to believe something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you just find,</v>

1700
01:15:52.460 --> 01:15:53.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

1701
01:15:53.120 --> 01:15:57.260
<v Speaker 2>this study that I also see circulating </v>
<v Speaker 2>around that why plants are really bad to</v>

1702
01:15:57.261 --> 01:15:58.810
<v Speaker 2>eat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like they're there,</v>

1703
01:15:58.811 --> 01:15:59.644
<v Speaker 2>they're there means that the insect anti</v>
<v Speaker 2>nutrients or pesticides from my former </v>

1704
01:16:03.351 --> 01:16:04.184
<v Speaker 2>mentor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1705
01:16:04.430 --> 01:16:05.263
<v Speaker 2>Dr Bruce Ames who spent his entire </v>
<v Speaker 2>career like advocating micronutrients </v>

1706
01:16:09.380 --> 01:16:11.630
<v Speaker 2>from vegetables and from me and from </v>
<v Speaker 2>fish.</v>

1707
01:16:11.660 --> 01:16:12.980
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like so ironic,</v>

1708
01:16:13.310 --> 01:16:16.610
<v Speaker 2>but if you actually read the paper,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not only does it say it doesn't,</v>

1709
01:16:16.660 --> 01:16:17.510
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>

1710
01:16:17.540 --> 01:16:21.410
<v Speaker 2>these insect antifa like sulforaphane </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't cause cancer,</v>

1711
01:16:21.411 --> 01:16:26.411
<v Speaker 2>but it also has a whole section on </v>
<v Speaker 2>heterocyclic amines from cooked meat.</v>

1712
01:16:27.020 --> 01:16:31.100
<v Speaker 2>So if you really want to use that paper </v>
<v Speaker 2>as an argument why to not eat plants,</v>

1713
01:16:31.280 --> 01:16:33.080
<v Speaker 2>then maybe read the paper and realize,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1714
01:16:33.081 --> 01:16:35.990
<v Speaker 2>it's also talking about heterocyclic </v>
<v Speaker 2>amines as well.</v>

1715
01:16:36.230 --> 01:16:38.770
<v Speaker 2>The point of the paper was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm getting a little emotional.</v>

1716
01:16:39.460 --> 01:16:40.293
<v Speaker 2>I like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The point of your robot self appointed </v>

1717
01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:44.833
<v Speaker 2>the paper was basically not to worry </v>
<v Speaker 2>about like some of the amounts that </v>

1718
01:16:48.291 --> 01:16:50.270
<v Speaker 2>you're being exposed to you with some of</v>
<v Speaker 2>these natural,</v>

1719
01:16:50.610 --> 01:16:52.760
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an insect antifa edits that are found in</v>

1720
01:16:52.761 --> 01:16:55.450
<v Speaker 2>plants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And some of the cook things and meet and</v>

1721
01:16:55.460 --> 01:16:56.293
<v Speaker 2>as well as some of the pesticides that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are found synthetic pesticides because </v>

1722
01:16:59.180 --> 01:17:01.010
<v Speaker 2>basically that they're in such small </v>
<v Speaker 2>amounts that,</v>

1723
01:17:01.280 --> 01:17:03.470
<v Speaker 2>so that was Kinda the point of the paper</v>
<v Speaker 2>was back in the nineties.</v>

1724
01:17:03.770 --> 01:17:05.240
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1725
01:17:05.270 --> 01:17:09.740
<v Speaker 2>but I just think that it's a little </v>
<v Speaker 2>hypocritical to use paper,</v>

1726
01:17:10.210 --> 01:17:10.880
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a,</v>

1727
01:17:10.880 --> 01:17:12.220
<v Speaker 3>as like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And literally it's like,</v>

1728
01:17:12.230 --> 01:17:14.480
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like proliferated everywhere.</v>

1729
01:17:14.481 --> 01:17:16.160
<v Speaker 3>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see this paper all the time.</v>

1730
01:17:16.410 --> 01:17:19.100
<v Speaker 3>Say Well did you read the paper because </v>
<v Speaker 3>it has a whole section on,</v>

1731
01:17:19.450 --> 01:17:21.980
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the insect antibiotics from coffee,</v>

1732
01:17:21.981 --> 01:17:24.830
<v Speaker 3>which a lot of people drink.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And also for me,</v>

1733
01:17:25.370 --> 01:17:26.203
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's that thing that people do where </v>

1734
01:17:28.761 --> 01:17:33.360
<v Speaker 3>they do have A.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a joke about it in my act about a</v>

1735
01:17:33.370 --> 01:17:34.203
<v Speaker 3>register,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a study that said that sperm can cure </v>

1736
01:17:37.581 --> 01:17:38.414
<v Speaker 3>depression in women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I slammed my laptop shut and I </v>

1737
01:17:42.140 --> 01:17:43.460
<v Speaker 3>didn't read another word.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1738
01:17:43.960 --> 01:17:48.530
<v Speaker 3>I've found the cure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this is me.</v>

1739
01:17:48.690 --> 01:17:50.340
<v Speaker 3>This is what the title.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1740
01:17:50.620 --> 01:17:52.790
<v Speaker 3>This is essentially what these people </v>
<v Speaker 3>were doing.</v>

1741
01:17:52.791 --> 01:17:53.150
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

1742
01:17:53.150 --> 01:17:56.900
<v Speaker 3>they will read or risk oftentimes don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>even read,</v>

1743
01:17:57.080 --> 01:17:57.913
<v Speaker 3>but recite from someone else's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>reciting it in a video didn't read </v>

1744
01:18:02.601 --> 01:18:03.434
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is what's going on with a lot of </v>

1745
01:18:04.221 --> 01:18:06.200
<v Speaker 3>this stuff and this is what I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>concerned with.</v>

1746
01:18:06.200 --> 01:18:07.880
<v Speaker 3>I keep seeing all these people like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

1747
01:18:07.881 --> 01:18:09.410
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to try the carnivore die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

1748
01:18:09.420 --> 01:18:11.060
<v Speaker 3>try the carnivore diet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I tell you,</v>

1749
01:18:11.270 --> 01:18:14.000
<v Speaker 3>it's amazing and I'm just sitting here </v>
<v Speaker 3>shaking my head.</v>

1750
01:18:14.001 --> 01:18:16.460
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this doesn't make any sense.</v>

1751
01:18:16.461 --> 01:18:17.294
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>

1752
01:18:17.450 --> 01:18:18.283
<v Speaker 3>Why would you want to eliminate a </v>
<v Speaker 3>massive source of bioavailable </v>

1753
01:18:22.341 --> 01:18:23.630
<v Speaker 3>nutrients?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1754
01:18:23.760 --> 01:18:24.593
<v Speaker 3>and then when they're talking about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>negative consequences of consuming </v>

1755
01:18:28.161 --> 01:18:28.994
<v Speaker 3>vegetables,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that there's different sort of toxic </v>

1756
01:18:32.661 --> 01:18:33.494
<v Speaker 3>elements.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do remember you talking about how </v>

1757
01:18:34.971 --> 01:18:39.500
<v Speaker 3>these stressors can actually have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>positive and beneficial result when your</v>

1758
01:18:39.501 --> 01:18:41.310
<v Speaker 3>body reacts to these stressors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1759
01:18:41.311 --> 01:18:42.144
<v Speaker 3>that's exactly how exercise works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's exactly a fasting works exactly </v>

1760
01:18:44.631 --> 01:18:48.320
<v Speaker 3>how heat stress from the sauna work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's how these phytochemicals.</v>

1761
01:18:49.160 --> 01:18:53.120
<v Speaker 3>I'm calling phytochemicals just as like </v>
<v Speaker 3>a generic category,</v>

1762
01:18:53.121 --> 01:18:57.560
<v Speaker 3>but they're are these compounds that are</v>
<v Speaker 3>made by plants to ward off insects.</v>

1763
01:18:57.920 --> 01:18:58.970
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1764
01:18:59.000 --> 01:18:59.760
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1765
01:18:59.760 --> 01:19:00.593
<v Speaker 3>and we evolved eating them and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>activate amazing stress response </v>

1766
01:19:03.501 --> 01:19:04.790
<v Speaker 3>pathways in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in humans,</v>

1767
01:19:04.910 --> 01:19:06.400
<v Speaker 3>in our brain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1768
01:19:06.410 --> 01:19:07.880
<v Speaker 3>in multiple in blood cells.</v>

1769
01:19:07.880 --> 01:19:08.713
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just human intervention trials </v>

1770
01:19:09.921 --> 01:19:13.310
<v Speaker 3>showing this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you're going gonna miss out.</v>

1771
01:19:13.990 --> 01:19:14.823
<v Speaker 3>We evolved with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're supposed to be stressed by </v>

1772
01:19:16.341 --> 01:19:17.174
<v Speaker 3>exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by fasting during the time restricted </v>

1773
01:19:18.951 --> 01:19:19.784
<v Speaker 3>eating like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're supposed to do that and we're </v>

1774
01:19:20.751 --> 01:19:23.780
<v Speaker 3>supposed to eat some plants I think </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're trying to accomplish.</v>

1775
01:19:23.850 --> 01:19:24.683
<v Speaker 3>They're trying to simplify something </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's incredibly complicated and </v>

1776
01:19:27.591 --> 01:19:30.720
<v Speaker 3>they're doing it with this sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>religious fervor is,</v>

1777
01:19:30.910 --> 01:19:34.010
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very strange and I can feel it when</v>

1778
01:19:34.011 --> 01:19:37.880
<v Speaker 3>I talk about it where people get upset,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're getting upset at me,</v>

1779
01:19:37.881 --> 01:19:41.540
<v Speaker 3>like I'm criticizing Jesus or something </v>
<v Speaker 3>very weird.</v>

1780
01:19:41.750 --> 01:19:43.490
<v Speaker 3>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a Vegan.</v>

1781
01:19:45.120 --> 01:19:47.000
<v Speaker 3>I eat lots of meat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1782
01:19:48.530 --> 01:19:51.560
<v Speaker 3>you and I have had conversations about </v>
<v Speaker 3>the importance of meat.</v>

1783
01:19:51.590 --> 01:19:53.120
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's,</v>

1784
01:19:53.230 --> 01:19:54.410
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1785
01:19:54.530 --> 01:19:56.480
<v Speaker 3>it's a religious thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It really is.</v>

1786
01:19:56.481 --> 01:19:57.314
<v Speaker 3>It's the same sort of mindset that </v>
<v Speaker 3>allows people to get by just rabidly </v>

1787
01:20:02.931 --> 01:20:06.950
<v Speaker 3>republican or anything else like fill in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the blanks,</v>

1788
01:20:06.960 --> 01:20:08.130
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1789
01:20:08.780 --> 01:20:09.700
<v Speaker 4>there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a,</v>

1790
01:20:09.750 --> 01:20:12.900
<v Speaker 4>it's just a thing that people do theirs </v>
<v Speaker 4>for the longest.</v>

1791
01:20:12.901 --> 01:20:15.960
<v Speaker 4>There's two different camps in Jujitsu </v>
<v Speaker 4>when you're something crazy,</v>

1792
01:20:16.260 --> 01:20:20.150
<v Speaker 4>there's g and Nogi a gooey is the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Kimono,</v>

1793
01:20:20.160 --> 01:20:22.050
<v Speaker 4>this white or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>multicolor,</v>

1794
01:20:22.060 --> 01:20:23.310
<v Speaker 4>you could wear it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>different colors now,</v>

1795
01:20:23.311 --> 01:20:27.780
<v Speaker 4>but it started out with why and um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of people learn their Jujitsu,</v>

1796
01:20:27.781 --> 01:20:29.700
<v Speaker 4>grabbing onto the geek,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1797
01:20:29.701 --> 01:20:32.540
<v Speaker 4>like sort of a Judogi or uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1798
01:20:32.790 --> 01:20:37.500
<v Speaker 4>Karate d and utilizing it as part of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>grappling technique.</v>

1799
01:20:37.770 --> 01:20:42.150
<v Speaker 4>And then Nogi came along and would Nogi </v>
<v Speaker 4>is they use rash guards,</v>

1800
01:20:42.151 --> 01:20:42.984
<v Speaker 4>they don't grab the clothes and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>concentrate on control of the body with </v>

1801
01:20:45.571 --> 01:20:48.330
<v Speaker 4>under hooks and over hooks and gable </v>
<v Speaker 4>grips and things along those lines.</v>

1802
01:20:48.750 --> 01:20:52.320
<v Speaker 4>And it became a religious battle between</v>
<v Speaker 4>D and Nogi.</v>

1803
01:20:52.590 --> 01:20:53.423
<v Speaker 4>And I remember sitting there watching </v>
<v Speaker 4>this and it was a problem because like </v>

1804
01:20:55.891 --> 01:20:56.760
<v Speaker 4>people would get angry.</v>

1805
01:20:56.760 --> 01:20:57.780
<v Speaker 4>What camp are you in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bro?</v>

1806
01:20:57.781 --> 01:21:00.480
<v Speaker 4>And I trained both.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have a black belt in,</v>

1807
01:21:00.690 --> 01:21:03.000
<v Speaker 4>I have a black belt Nogi.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I trained both of them.</v>

1808
01:21:03.001 --> 01:21:04.620
<v Speaker 4>I think there's benefits to both of </v>
<v Speaker 4>them,</v>

1809
01:21:05.040 --> 01:21:08.850
<v Speaker 4>but there was this weird thing where you</v>
<v Speaker 4>were supposed to choose sides.</v>

1810
01:21:09.030 --> 01:21:12.480
<v Speaker 4>It's since alleviated and people realize</v>
<v Speaker 4>how preposterous it is,</v>

1811
01:21:12.900 --> 01:21:15.630
<v Speaker 4>but for a long time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like four years,</v>

1812
01:21:15.631 --> 01:21:16.464
<v Speaker 4>the Jujitsu community was split where </v>
<v Speaker 4>people were angry at people who are the </v>

1813
01:21:19.711 --> 01:21:23.190
<v Speaker 4>gate or angry at people who were no gay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like my friend Eddie,</v>

1814
01:21:23.191 --> 01:21:24.024
<v Speaker 4>Eddie Bravo who teaches no gay people </v>
<v Speaker 4>were angry at him for teaching a system </v>

1815
01:21:28.171 --> 01:21:31.560
<v Speaker 4>of Jujitsu that didn't involve a certain</v>
<v Speaker 4>type of clothing.</v>

1816
01:21:31.710 --> 01:21:32.543
<v Speaker 4>It's the same mindset.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People just want you to believe what </v>

1817
01:21:35.551 --> 01:21:38.460
<v Speaker 4>they believe only and they get rabid </v>
<v Speaker 4>about it.</v>

1818
01:21:38.461 --> 01:21:39.294
<v Speaker 4>They get crazy and I'm seeing this with </v>
<v Speaker 4>this carnivore diet and I think there's </v>

1819
01:21:42.571 --> 01:21:43.404
<v Speaker 4>a psychological aspect of it to it that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you were talking about when in terms of </v>

1820
01:21:47.280 --> 01:21:51.480
<v Speaker 4>this placebo effect that I think they </v>
<v Speaker 4>feel like I've never felt better.</v>

1821
01:21:51.630 --> 01:21:53.760
<v Speaker 4>I'm on this carnivore diet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm doing chin ups.</v>

1822
01:21:53.761 --> 01:21:54.594
<v Speaker 4>I'm running around the block.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like when you read about everyone </v>

1823
01:21:56.371 --> 01:22:00.270
<v Speaker 4>feeling better and I want in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to on this carnivore diet,</v>

1824
01:22:00.390 --> 01:22:02.160
<v Speaker 4>and then there's also.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1825
01:22:02.220 --> 01:22:06.510
<v Speaker 4>if you are doing this as opposed to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>standard American diet,</v>

1826
01:22:06.630 --> 01:22:07.463
<v Speaker 4>I think you have the same sort of </v>
<v Speaker 4>response that you have when people are </v>

1827
01:22:09.961 --> 01:22:12.300
<v Speaker 4>talking about the positive benefits of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the Vegan Diet.</v>

1828
01:22:12.690 --> 01:22:13.523
<v Speaker 4>I think if you have a Po,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you have a vegan diet in comparison </v>

1829
01:22:16.021 --> 01:22:18.510
<v Speaker 4>to eating chips and fries and soda,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1830
01:22:18.511 --> 01:22:21.000
<v Speaker 4>you're going to feel fucking amazing and</v>
<v Speaker 4>people talk about it.</v>

1831
01:22:21.050 --> 01:22:24.630
<v Speaker 4>It's just like they did the carnival and</v>
<v Speaker 4>they get and they want you to do.</v>

1832
01:22:24.780 --> 01:22:25.560
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's pee.</v>

1833
01:22:25.560 --> 01:22:26.393
<v Speaker 4>I'm seeing the same patterns that I see </v>
<v Speaker 4>with vegans were these carnivore people </v>

1834
01:22:30.121 --> 01:22:32.910
<v Speaker 4>are putting meat and their screen name,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1835
01:22:32.911 --> 01:22:34.230
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>mediator Mike,</v>

1836
01:22:34.460 --> 01:22:36.160
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Carnivore Carl.</v>

1837
01:22:36.210 --> 01:22:39.300
<v Speaker 4>There are other fucking crazy people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're doing the same thing that vegans</v>

1838
01:22:39.301 --> 01:22:41.070
<v Speaker 4>do with our,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on the Vegan warrior.</v>

1839
01:22:41.140 --> 01:22:43.140
<v Speaker 4>I'm carnivores Carl,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1840
01:22:43.160 --> 01:22:45.540
<v Speaker 4>fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Planning poisoned and they're assholes.</v>

1841
01:22:45.541 --> 01:22:47.040
<v Speaker 4>You don't even understand what you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing to your body.</v>

1842
01:22:47.260 --> 01:22:49.740
<v Speaker 4>And then because I like plants,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like,</v>

1843
01:22:51.040 --> 01:22:54.720
<v Speaker 4>you get thrown in and you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to pick a camp.</v>

1844
01:22:54.960 --> 01:22:56.080
<v Speaker 4>I'm not picking a cab.</v>

1845
01:22:58.370 --> 01:22:59.203
<v Speaker 4>I liked my Paleo Diet and I actually,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm probably going to try a little bit </v>

1846
01:23:01.621 --> 01:23:03.040
<v Speaker 4>of Quito.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm gonna.</v>

1847
01:23:03.090 --> 01:23:04.800
<v Speaker 4>I'm gonna Experiment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're a little bit too.</v>

1848
01:23:04.830 --> 01:23:06.400
<v Speaker 4>So there's some great positive</v>

1849
01:23:06.700 --> 01:23:08.500
<v Speaker 1>cognitive benefits for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1850
01:23:08.501 --> 01:23:09.850
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've really experienced that.</v>

1851
01:23:10.030 --> 01:23:10.863
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard for me because what knocks me </v>

1852
01:23:12.041 --> 01:23:12.874
<v Speaker 1>out ironically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but knocks me out of Ketosis with the </v>

1853
01:23:15.251 --> 01:23:18.280
<v Speaker 1>most of my diet is fairly ketogenic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sep,</v>

1854
01:23:18.310 --> 01:23:19.640
<v Speaker 1>I eat too much meat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1855
01:23:20.530 --> 01:23:22.210
<v Speaker 1>I crave it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm always the guy to.</v>

1856
01:23:22.450 --> 01:23:23.110
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need,</v>

1857
01:23:23.110 --> 01:23:25.360
<v Speaker 1>I think I need a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

1858
01:23:25.390 --> 01:23:28.030
<v Speaker 1>maybe I'm just full of Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

1859
01:23:28.031 --> 01:23:29.800
<v Speaker 1>I also have a lot because I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1860
01:23:29.801 --> 01:23:33.400
<v Speaker 1>I hunt elk and shoot a 400 pound animal </v>
<v Speaker 1>and good quality meat.</v>

1861
01:23:33.550 --> 01:23:34.720
<v Speaker 1>It's the best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1862
01:23:34.870 --> 01:23:38.170
<v Speaker 1>And I'll eat a fucking pound of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm eating like,</v>

1863
01:23:38.470 --> 01:23:40.170
<v Speaker 1>who knows how many grams of protein that</v>
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

1864
01:23:40.171 --> 01:23:42.940
<v Speaker 1>It's something insane,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean,</v>

1865
01:23:42.941 --> 01:23:43.774
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's a placebo effect </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I've been doing this for years </v>

1866
01:23:46.121 --> 01:23:47.920
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel pretty fucking good,</v>

1867
01:23:48.430 --> 01:23:48.850
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

1868
01:23:48.850 --> 01:23:50.530
<v Speaker 1>we're doing this fitness challenge now.</v>

1869
01:23:50.530 --> 01:23:53.140
<v Speaker 1>That's what this thing is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Me and my friend,</v>

1870
01:23:53.141 --> 01:23:55.540
<v Speaker 1>Bert Kreischer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my friend Tom Seger in Arusha fear,</v>

1871
01:23:55.541 --> 01:23:56.374
<v Speaker 1>we for the month,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have to see who burns the most </v>

1872
01:23:59.531 --> 01:24:00.364
<v Speaker 1>calories and gets the most maps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is my zone thing and I'm planning </v>

1873
01:24:03.821 --> 01:24:05.470
<v Speaker 1>on killing those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm planning.</v>

1874
01:24:05.480 --> 01:24:08.560
<v Speaker 1>I'm literally having them try to die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Keep up with me.</v>

1875
01:24:08.740 --> 01:24:10.140
<v Speaker 1>Sober October.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1876
01:24:10.450 --> 01:24:11.770
<v Speaker 1>October.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going on right now.</v>

1877
01:24:12.670 --> 01:24:14.610
<v Speaker 1>Is there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there a hot yoga and sauna involved?</v>

1878
01:24:14.611 --> 01:24:15.444
<v Speaker 1>So I'm doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those pussies are just going to try to </v>

1879
01:24:16.571 --> 01:24:17.404
<v Speaker 1>like go run around the block,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm doing the 15 hot yogas plus I'm </v>

1880
01:24:22.121 --> 01:24:22.954
<v Speaker 1>doing all sorts of the crate to one our </v>
<v Speaker 1>hardcore cardio sessions yesterday and </v>

1881
01:24:27.911 --> 01:24:32.500
<v Speaker 1>then today I'm going to do kickboxing </v>
<v Speaker 1>for an hour and a half tomorrow.</v>

1882
01:24:32.501 --> 01:24:34.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to do an hour and a half of </v>
<v Speaker 1>yoga in the morning.</v>

1883
01:24:34.541 --> 01:24:35.374
<v Speaker 1>Then I'm going to run at night too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You definitely should eat more meat </v>

1884
01:24:37.680 --> 01:24:38.390
<v Speaker 1>more.</v>

1885
01:24:38.390 --> 01:24:41.740
<v Speaker 1>I'm I'm planning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want these guys to break.</v>

1886
01:24:41.800 --> 01:24:43.030
<v Speaker 1>That's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Break them.</v>

1887
01:24:43.060 --> 01:24:46.300
<v Speaker 1>Burt burt's getting cockies posting </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff on instagram today.</v>

1888
01:24:46.450 --> 01:24:48.820
<v Speaker 1>I talked to burt about some song.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was real into the sauna.</v>

1889
01:24:49.740 --> 01:24:54.010
<v Speaker 1>He's asking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's really into vodka and cheeseburgers</v>

1890
01:24:54.470 --> 01:24:56.800
<v Speaker 1>that actually caused you to excrete </v>
<v Speaker 1>micronutrients,</v>

1891
01:24:56.801 --> 01:25:00.070
<v Speaker 1>zinc and magnesium haven't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1892
01:25:00.130 --> 01:25:00.963
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1893
01:25:01.050 --> 01:25:03.280
<v Speaker 1>you know what else it causes you to </v>
<v Speaker 1>excrete jokes.</v>

1894
01:25:03.640 --> 01:25:04.473
<v Speaker 1>That's part of the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You Scott Damn hilarious when he's </v>

1895
01:25:05.951 --> 01:25:09.460
<v Speaker 1>drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a part of the problem.</v>

1896
01:25:09.650 --> 01:25:11.380
<v Speaker 1>Know again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>balance.</v>

1897
01:25:12.430 --> 01:25:13.263
<v Speaker 1>I think this is a very important </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation to have because I think </v>

1898
01:25:15.251 --> 01:25:16.084
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of people that are enticed</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the magic of this carnivore diet and </v>

1899
01:25:19.091 --> 01:25:19.924
<v Speaker 1>I think uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm so happy that you or the one that </v>

1900
01:25:22.361 --> 01:25:23.194
<v Speaker 1>can cause you can do it in such a </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientific manner and just sort of </v>

1901
01:25:25.751 --> 01:25:26.584
<v Speaker 1>illuminated all the various problems and</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of explain why they are </v>

1902
01:25:31.601 --> 01:25:35.080
<v Speaker 1>experiencing these benefits because even</v>
<v Speaker 1>brilliant man like Jordan Peterson,</v>

1903
01:25:35.081 --> 01:25:35.914
<v Speaker 1>he's a brilliant guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He is just accepting the positive </v>

1904
01:25:37.901 --> 01:25:41.140
<v Speaker 1>benefits of this and I don't know how </v>
<v Speaker 1>far he's looked into this.</v>

1905
01:25:41.260 --> 01:25:42.041
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1906
01:25:42.041 --> 01:25:43.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and also it's important like the,</v>

1907
01:25:43.731 --> 01:25:44.370
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1908
01:25:44.370 --> 01:25:48.580
<v Speaker 2>the fact that the no cbu thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>experiencing bad things,</v>

1909
01:25:48.581 --> 01:25:49.414
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>also things when you change your </v>

1910
01:25:50.231 --> 01:25:53.350
<v Speaker 2>microbiome and you're going along period</v>
<v Speaker 2>of time or just eating meat.</v>

1911
01:25:53.380 --> 01:25:54.213
<v Speaker 2>I mean it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>vegans that like eat me or people that </v>

1912
01:25:56.471 --> 01:25:59.980
<v Speaker 2>are on a low fat diet that eat fat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they experienced negative effects.</v>

1913
01:25:59.981 --> 01:26:02.920
<v Speaker 2>I mean because they're there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our microbiome changes that do occur and</v>

1914
01:26:03.890 --> 01:26:06.320
<v Speaker 2>lead to discomfort and those things will</v>
<v Speaker 2>eventually go away.</v>

1915
01:26:06.321 --> 01:26:07.154
<v Speaker 2>But that was also something to consider </v>
<v Speaker 2>like so there may be a no seatbelt on </v>

1916
01:26:10.101 --> 01:26:10.934
<v Speaker 2>top of actual things that are short term</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that it's not just people that eat </v>

1917
01:26:15.081 --> 01:26:16.570
<v Speaker 2>meat and then all of a sudden need some </v>
<v Speaker 2>plans.</v>

1918
01:26:16.571 --> 01:26:17.990
<v Speaker 2>So like I knew it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1919
01:26:18.520 --> 01:26:19.353
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are changes that have takes some </v>

1920
01:26:20.571 --> 01:26:21.404
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little bit of time in the microbiome </v>

1921
01:26:22.101 --> 01:26:25.850
<v Speaker 2>that may be happening because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>definitely begins talking about the same</v>

1922
01:26:25.851 --> 01:26:26.210
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

1923
01:26:26.210 --> 01:26:28.100
<v Speaker 2>People on a low fat that you eat a high </v>
<v Speaker 2>fat diet,</v>

1924
01:26:28.490 --> 01:26:29.660
<v Speaker 2>say the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1925
01:26:29.661 --> 01:26:30.980
<v Speaker 2>so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some,</v>

1926
01:26:31.010 --> 01:26:33.230
<v Speaker 2>someone's got to be right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well maybe everyone's right.</v>

1927
01:26:33.530 --> 01:26:35.480
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe there's a mechanism,</v>

1928
01:26:36.050 --> 01:26:38.110
<v Speaker 2>the microbiome changes and everyone's </v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1929
01:26:38.480 --> 01:26:40.790
<v Speaker 2>Your body adjusts dependent upon your </v>
<v Speaker 2>diet.</v>

1930
01:26:40.970 --> 01:26:41.361
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1931
01:26:41.361 --> 01:26:42.200
<v Speaker 2>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's been shown.</v>

1932
01:26:42.201 --> 01:26:43.034
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the microbiome does change depending on </v>

1933
01:26:43.791 --> 01:26:45.010
<v Speaker 2>your diet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

1934
01:26:45.230 --> 01:26:46.063
<v Speaker 2>if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're eating a low fat and then </v>

1935
01:26:47.031 --> 01:26:48.920
<v Speaker 2>going to a high fat diet in that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

1936
01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:49.600
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

1937
01:26:49.600 --> 01:26:51.470
<v Speaker 2>you're making bile acids and things like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1938
01:26:51.471 --> 01:26:52.304
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you don't have a microbiome that are </v>

1939
01:26:53.601 --> 01:26:54.434
<v Speaker 2>resistant to that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can start to have microbiome being </v>

1940
01:26:56.181 --> 01:26:57.860
<v Speaker 2>killed off and then it can cause </v>
<v Speaker 2>inflammation.</v>

1941
01:26:58.130 --> 01:26:59.570
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the going from the plant.</v>

1942
01:26:59.571 --> 01:27:00.110
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

1943
01:27:00.110 --> 01:27:02.540
<v Speaker 2>you're basically selecting for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're eating a bunch of protein,</v>

1944
01:27:02.541 --> 01:27:04.220
<v Speaker 2>you've got a lot of putrifactive </v>
<v Speaker 2>bacteria,</v>

1945
01:27:04.221 --> 01:27:06.080
<v Speaker 2>maybe less of the other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1946
01:27:06.081 --> 01:27:06.914
<v Speaker 2>maybe it takes some time to be able to </v>
<v Speaker 2>like ferment some of those complex </v>

1947
01:27:10.611 --> 01:27:12.350
<v Speaker 2>carbohydrate fermentable fibers and </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>

1948
01:27:12.350 --> 01:27:15.920
<v Speaker 2>So I think that there's the mechanism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1949
01:27:15.921 --> 01:27:17.570
<v Speaker 2>it's not even easy to figure out </v>
<v Speaker 2>mechanism,</v>

1950
01:27:17.571 --> 01:27:21.200
<v Speaker 2>but there's usually a mechanism and an </v>
<v Speaker 2>explanation for these four things.</v>

1951
01:27:21.201 --> 01:27:22.034
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes you have a hypothesis and </v>

1952
01:27:23.301 --> 01:27:24.890
<v Speaker 2>sometimes it's writing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes it's not.</v>

1953
01:27:25.400 --> 01:27:27.380
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't mean what you're experiencing</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't real,</v>

1954
01:27:27.381 --> 01:27:28.214
<v Speaker 2>just means that you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you didn't understand why you're </v>

1955
01:27:29.360 --> 01:27:30.710
<v Speaker 2>experiencing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you thought you did,</v>

1956
01:27:30.711 --> 01:27:31.544
<v Speaker 2>but you didn't Makilah Peterson.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that when she first got on the </v>

1957
01:27:33.880 --> 01:27:36.530
<v Speaker 2>carnivores,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she had diarrhea for six solid weeks.</v>

1958
01:27:37.730 --> 01:27:39.500
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That would,</v>

1959
01:27:39.520 --> 01:27:41.390
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>push through it.</v>

1960
01:27:41.630 --> 01:27:42.920
<v Speaker 2>That would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no pun intended.</v>

1961
01:27:42.921 --> 01:27:44.660
<v Speaker 2>Shake me loose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1962
01:27:44.661 --> 01:27:45.950
<v Speaker 2>It'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1963
01:27:46.430 --> 01:27:49.810
<v Speaker 2>after about two weeks ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I'm kinda tired of shit in my pants</v>

1964
01:27:51.560 --> 01:27:54.140
<v Speaker 2>this six months.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot.</v>

1965
01:27:54.141 --> 01:27:58.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For her it was worth it in comparison to</v>

1966
01:27:58.330 --> 01:27:59.030
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1967
01:27:59.030 --> 01:28:01.910
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the negative effects that she was having</v>

1968
01:28:02.280 --> 01:28:03.380
<v Speaker 2>on her immune system.</v>

1969
01:28:03.440 --> 01:28:04.140
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1970
01:28:04.140 --> 01:28:06.020
<v Speaker 2>you might want to talk to her about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fasting.</v>

1971
01:28:06.050 --> 01:28:07.190
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying that.</v>

1972
01:28:07.191 --> 01:28:09.070
<v Speaker 2>If she's open minded,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1973
01:28:09.080 --> 01:28:12.520
<v Speaker 2>at the end of the day it's hard when </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone's experiencing it is,</v>

1974
01:28:12.780 --> 01:28:15.800
<v Speaker 2>it is hard and it is hard when they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's just,</v>

1975
01:28:15.801 --> 01:28:17.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1976
01:28:17.061 --> 01:28:20.600
<v Speaker 2>I get that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it also is important to realize that</v>

1977
01:28:20.601 --> 01:28:21.434
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there hasn't been proved that she's </v>

1978
01:28:24.651 --> 01:28:25.484
<v Speaker 2>experiencing what she's experiencing </v>
<v Speaker 2>because she's caught all plans out and </v>

1979
01:28:28.400 --> 01:28:29.233
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so at the end of the day there is no </v>

1980
01:28:32.241 --> 01:28:34.550
<v Speaker 2>data.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you can't say definitively,</v>

1981
01:28:34.551 --> 01:28:37.580
<v Speaker 2>but I mean there's a lot of data on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1982
01:28:37.581 --> 01:28:40.070
<v Speaker 2>why you should include some plants at </v>
<v Speaker 2>least.</v>

1983
01:28:40.100 --> 01:28:42.230
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're doing this for an autoimmune,</v>

1984
01:28:42.260 --> 01:28:44.590
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of really good data that </v>
<v Speaker 2>fasting helps,</v>

1985
01:28:44.600 --> 01:28:46.010
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and not only helps,</v>

1986
01:28:46.190 --> 01:28:48.740
<v Speaker 2>it helps you age,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I'm going to start doing just like,</v>

1987
01:28:48.800 --> 01:28:49.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some,</v>

1988
01:28:49.430 --> 01:28:50.263
<v Speaker 2>some fast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like couple times a year once I've </v>

1989
01:28:51.650 --> 01:28:54.800
<v Speaker 2>completely weaned my son how many days </v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

1990
01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:55.833
<v Speaker 2>so a prolonged fast take,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm technically in humans according </v>

1991
01:28:58.431 --> 01:29:00.080
<v Speaker 2>to Dr Valter Longo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

1992
01:29:00.081 --> 01:29:02.370
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he thinks that it has to be more than 48</v>

1993
01:29:02.371 --> 01:29:05.850
<v Speaker 2>hours,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you can do like a 72 hour fast and my</v>

1994
01:29:05.851 --> 01:29:08.310
<v Speaker 2>inlaws have been doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've done like a couple of three,</v>

1995
01:29:08.311 --> 01:29:09.144
<v Speaker 2>three and a half day fast and they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting all sorts of massive </v>

1996
01:29:10.951 --> 01:29:15.951
<v Speaker 2>improvements in a variety of biomarkers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a Lipid and glucose and inflammation.</v>

1997
01:29:17.250 --> 01:29:18.083
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of things that I know carnivore </v>

1998
01:29:18.991 --> 01:29:21.390
<v Speaker 2>people are talking about as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but could be getting the same thing with</v>

1999
01:29:21.391 --> 01:29:22.340
<v Speaker 2>fasting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2000
01:29:22.500 --> 01:29:23.333
<v Speaker 2>you're doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you limiting the amount of exercise </v>

2001
01:29:25.261 --> 01:29:26.670
<v Speaker 2>you do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people do.</v>

2002
01:29:26.671 --> 01:29:28.200
<v Speaker 2>It depends on how you feel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2003
01:29:28.250 --> 01:29:29.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you certainly,</v>

2004
01:29:29.790 --> 01:29:33.330
<v Speaker 2>I think that if you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're not eating any food and you're</v>

2005
01:29:33.331 --> 01:29:35.390
<v Speaker 2>just doing like a water fast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2006
01:29:35.460 --> 01:29:36.293
<v Speaker 2>you certainly could be more dangerous </v>
<v Speaker 2>and should listen to your body and if </v>

2007
01:29:39.031 --> 01:29:40.860
<v Speaker 2>you feel really sick or your heart's </v>
<v Speaker 2>racing,</v>

2008
01:29:40.861 --> 01:29:41.694
<v Speaker 2>I think they just need to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You mean something that like I wouldn't </v>

2009
01:29:44.830 --> 01:29:47.970
<v Speaker 2>just willy nilly doing as opposed to </v>
<v Speaker 2>what other kinds of things.</v>

2010
01:29:47.990 --> 01:29:50.880
<v Speaker 2>The fact there's a fasting mimicking </v>
<v Speaker 2>diet where people can.</v>

2011
01:29:50.881 --> 01:29:51.714
<v Speaker 2>This is something valter Longo has </v>
<v Speaker 2>published on in humans and study humans </v>

2012
01:29:54.910 --> 01:29:57.870
<v Speaker 2>as well as animal data where it's like a</v>
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>

2013
01:29:58.170 --> 01:29:59.003
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the first day it's like a thousand </v>

2014
01:29:59.761 --> 01:30:00.594
<v Speaker 2>calories and the second through fifth </v>
<v Speaker 2>day it's like 700 calories and then </v>

2015
01:30:04.561 --> 01:30:06.840
<v Speaker 2>they're broken up where it's like the </v>
<v Speaker 2>first day it's like,</v>

2016
01:30:07.110 --> 01:30:09.990
<v Speaker 2>it's very much a low sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>low protein,</v>

2017
01:30:11.160 --> 01:30:13.290
<v Speaker 2>high fat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>modest carb kind of diet.</v>

2018
01:30:13.410 --> 01:30:15.060
<v Speaker 2>So what are the pros of that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>consume?</v>

2019
01:30:15.061 --> 01:30:16.440
<v Speaker 2>Like nuts and not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2020
01:30:16.441 --> 01:30:17.274
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well he's got like a package kind of </v>

2021
01:30:18.181 --> 01:30:20.070
<v Speaker 2>thing that people like can be </v>
<v Speaker 2>prescribed,</v>

2022
01:30:20.071 --> 01:30:22.350
<v Speaker 2>like a physician can prescribe it to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>patient,</v>

2023
01:30:22.351 --> 01:30:23.770
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

2024
01:30:23.860 --> 01:30:24.540
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can,</v>

2025
01:30:24.540 --> 01:30:27.780
<v Speaker 2>you can sort of make your own as well </v>
<v Speaker 2>with whole foods,</v>

2026
01:30:27.781 --> 01:30:28.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2027
01:30:28.490 --> 01:30:31.170
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like an avocado some.</v>

2028
01:30:31.230 --> 01:30:34.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you have to sort of keep the calorie</v>

2029
01:30:34.441 --> 01:30:37.110
<v Speaker 2>cap so make sure you're not getting too </v>
<v Speaker 2>many calories.</v>

2030
01:30:37.140 --> 01:30:39.510
<v Speaker 2>That's kind of important as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you do that for five days.</v>

2031
01:30:39.540 --> 01:30:43.340
<v Speaker 2>What is the standard avocado oil avocado</v>
<v Speaker 2>contains terms of calorie?</v>

2032
01:30:43.610 --> 01:30:44.443
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2033
01:30:44.450 --> 01:30:45.650
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2034
01:30:45.880 --> 01:30:46.531
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

2035
01:30:46.531 --> 01:30:47.364
<v Speaker 2>you can do like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you could definitely do like an </v>

2036
01:30:48.571 --> 01:30:49.404
<v Speaker 2>avocado if it's like the whole day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then some people have sort of done </v>

2037
01:30:52.501 --> 01:30:53.334
<v Speaker 2>modified versions of it as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like where it's a little more key to </v>

2038
01:30:55.021 --> 01:30:55.854
<v Speaker 2>genic the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've adjusted the carbohydrate and </v>

2039
01:30:57.871 --> 01:30:59.760
<v Speaker 2>fat to be a little more of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ketogenic.</v>

2040
01:30:59.970 --> 01:31:00.803
<v Speaker 2>And like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm the study that was published in </v>

2041
01:31:03.841 --> 01:31:06.480
<v Speaker 2>parallel with a fasting mimicking diet </v>
<v Speaker 2>study,</v>

2042
01:31:06.780 --> 01:31:09.210
<v Speaker 2>the fasting mimicking diet they did for </v>
<v Speaker 2>three months,</v>

2043
01:31:09.330 --> 01:31:11.460
<v Speaker 2>but it was only one week that did the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fasting mimicking diet.</v>

2044
01:31:11.461 --> 01:31:12.294
<v Speaker 2>So that the other part or the three </v>
<v Speaker 2>months they were eating a Mediterranean </v>

2045
01:31:15.660 --> 01:31:16.493
<v Speaker 2>diet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the other people in which was in </v>

2046
01:31:18.271 --> 01:31:19.130
<v Speaker 2>Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2047
01:31:19.350 --> 01:31:20.183
<v Speaker 2>they were on a ketogenic diet and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>were on it for three months and they </v>

2048
01:31:21.751 --> 01:31:26.751
<v Speaker 2>experienced improvements as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's definitely ways to tweak it.</v>

2049
01:31:28.591 --> 01:31:31.500
<v Speaker 2>And actually the out getting to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Alzheimer's.</v>

2050
01:31:31.770 --> 01:31:32.920
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2051
01:31:33.110 --> 01:31:33.800
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2052
01:31:33.800 --> 01:31:35.790
<v Speaker 2>the guy that I interviewed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dr Dale Bredesen,</v>

2053
01:31:36.110 --> 01:31:37.770
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

2054
01:31:37.860 --> 01:31:40.770
<v Speaker 2>he is published extensively and also as </v>
<v Speaker 2>clinical,</v>

2055
01:31:40.830 --> 01:31:41.663
<v Speaker 2>a lot of clinical experience where he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's trying to understand the mechanism </v>

2056
01:31:44.251 --> 01:31:45.084
<v Speaker 2>of Alzheimer's disease and I'm getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>to this for the Ketogenic is going to </v>

2057
01:31:47.731 --> 01:31:51.090
<v Speaker 2>come back eventually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But so he,</v>

2058
01:31:51.091 --> 01:31:51.924
<v Speaker 2>he tries to understand a lot of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>underlying mechanisms for Alzheimer's </v>

2059
01:31:54.121 --> 01:31:54.900
<v Speaker 2>disease.</v>

2060
01:31:54.900 --> 01:31:55.733
<v Speaker 2>And in his clinical experience he sort </v>
<v Speaker 2>of sees there's subtypes of where you </v>

2061
01:31:59.770 --> 01:32:03.700
<v Speaker 2>can get like patients that have a really</v>
<v Speaker 2>high inflammatory where they've got lots</v>

2062
01:32:03.701 --> 01:32:05.880
<v Speaker 2>of inflammatory biomarkers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2063
01:32:05.920 --> 01:32:10.040
<v Speaker 2>they also have high fasting blood </v>
<v Speaker 2>glucose in there.</v>

2064
01:32:10.060 --> 01:32:11.230
<v Speaker 2>Little like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2065
01:32:11.340 --> 01:32:12.173
<v Speaker 2>a high fasting insulin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then you can get the same sort of </v>

2066
01:32:14.891 --> 01:32:15.724
<v Speaker 2>metabolic effect where you have people </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are kind of on the insulin </v>

2067
01:32:18.461 --> 01:32:19.294
<v Speaker 2>resistant Spectra,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but without inflammation there's that </v>

2068
01:32:22.031 --> 01:32:22.864
<v Speaker 2>subtype.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there's like another subtype </v>

2069
01:32:23.640 --> 01:32:24.473
<v Speaker 2>where it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems like a big environmental </v>

2070
01:32:25.511 --> 01:32:26.344
<v Speaker 2>component like toxic stuff people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>being exposed to and that leads to a </v>

2071
01:32:29.471 --> 01:32:32.280
<v Speaker 2>much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>much earlier diagnosis and Alzheimer and</v>

2072
01:32:32.330 --> 01:32:34.650
<v Speaker 2>sort of different phenotype.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

2073
01:32:35.110 --> 01:32:35.943
<v Speaker 2>he has this really aggressive and very </v>
<v Speaker 2>thorough protocol that's like on the </v>

2074
01:32:40.361 --> 01:32:41.850
<v Speaker 2>individual level where people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2075
01:32:41.920 --> 01:32:44.680
<v Speaker 2>he has tons and tons of biomarkers that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are measured.</v>

2076
01:32:45.070 --> 01:32:45.903
<v Speaker 2>One is the fasting blood glucose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so she'd be less than five point five </v>

2077
01:32:48.190 --> 01:32:49.840
<v Speaker 2>actually gets Hba,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one C,</v>

2078
01:32:49.841 --> 01:32:50.674
<v Speaker 2>which is a three month mark or a fasting</v>
<v Speaker 2>blood glucose should be less than five </v>

2079
01:32:52.961 --> 01:32:53.794
<v Speaker 2>point five.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fasting insulin should be less than </v>

2080
01:32:55.031 --> 01:32:56.130
<v Speaker 2>seven.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2081
01:32:56.200 --> 01:32:57.033
<v Speaker 2>he's got your high sensitivity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>C reactive protein should be less than </v>

2082
01:32:59.111 --> 01:32:59.944
<v Speaker 2>point eight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he has a variety of other </v>

2083
01:33:01.271 --> 01:33:02.980
<v Speaker 2>inflammatory biomarkers that are also </v>
<v Speaker 2>measured.</v>

2084
01:33:03.590 --> 01:33:05.500
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a variety of other things.</v>

2085
01:33:05.501 --> 01:33:07.300
<v Speaker 2>He looks at a lot of different </v>
<v Speaker 2>micronutrients.</v>

2086
01:33:07.301 --> 01:33:08.134
<v Speaker 2>He looks at a homocysteine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>homocysteine is really important </v>

2087
01:33:10.841 --> 01:33:11.500
<v Speaker 2>because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2088
01:33:11.500 --> 01:33:16.110
<v Speaker 2>there's publications showing that if you</v>
<v Speaker 2>lower homocysteine it cannot enact.</v>

2089
01:33:16.150 --> 01:33:18.400
<v Speaker 2>He actually published this in one </v>
<v Speaker 2>patient.</v>

2090
01:33:18.401 --> 01:33:21.430
<v Speaker 2>It reversed the hippocampal atrophy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is kind of amazing.</v>

2091
01:33:21.610 --> 01:33:22.361
<v Speaker 2>So there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2092
01:33:22.361 --> 01:33:24.250
<v Speaker 2>it's not really knowing exactly what the</v>
<v Speaker 2>mechanism is,</v>

2093
01:33:24.251 --> 01:33:25.084
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's something he looks at and he </v>

2094
01:33:26.291 --> 01:33:27.250
<v Speaker 2>does this diet.</v>

2095
01:33:27.460 --> 01:33:30.880
<v Speaker 2>I'm this like diet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this whole lifestyle change.</v>

2096
01:33:30.881 --> 01:33:31.714
<v Speaker 2>I mean people improving sleep exercise </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he gives them all sorts of vitamins </v>

2097
01:33:34.211 --> 01:33:35.560
<v Speaker 2>and fish oil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But on top of that,</v>

2098
01:33:35.890 --> 01:33:36.723
<v Speaker 2>he's this diet that he is Kinda like to </v>
<v Speaker 2>lower the inflammation and improve the </v>

2099
01:33:41.380 --> 01:33:42.213
<v Speaker 2>insulin sensitivity and blood glucose </v>
<v Speaker 2>and all that where he puts them on a </v>

2100
01:33:44.861 --> 01:33:47.260
<v Speaker 2>diet that's kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he calls it Quito flags,</v>

2101
01:33:47.261 --> 01:33:49.570
<v Speaker 2>but it's Kinda like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a key to genic diet,</v>

2102
01:33:49.600 --> 01:33:50.433
<v Speaker 2>modified ketogenic diet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But a lot of the fats are coming from </v>

2103
01:33:52.991 --> 01:33:55.180
<v Speaker 2>like plants versus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like avocado,</v>

2104
01:33:55.181 --> 01:33:56.710
<v Speaker 2>nuts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>olive oil,</v>

2105
01:33:57.340 --> 01:33:59.650
<v Speaker 2>he treats me as a condiment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2106
01:33:59.800 --> 01:34:01.030
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2107
01:34:01.270 --> 01:34:02.103
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and basically is getting improvements </v>

2108
01:34:03.551 --> 01:34:05.050
<v Speaker 2>like with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with this type of diet,</v>

2109
01:34:05.080 --> 01:34:07.420
<v Speaker 2>lowering inflammation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>proving all sorts of metabolic things.</v>

2110
01:34:07.950 --> 01:34:09.670
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's really,</v>

2111
01:34:09.880 --> 01:34:10.970
<v Speaker 2>it's really interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

2112
01:34:10.971 --> 01:34:12.270
<v Speaker 2>I've read a lot of his studies because </v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

2113
01:34:12.310 --> 01:34:15.610
<v Speaker 2>he publishes a lot on Alzheimer's </v>
<v Speaker 2>disease and mechanisms,</v>

2114
01:34:15.611 --> 01:34:16.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's,</v>

2115
01:34:16.690 --> 01:34:19.120
<v Speaker 2>he's got a book out as well where he'd </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of goes in depth about it.</v>

2116
01:34:19.630 --> 01:34:21.140
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it,</v>

2117
01:34:21.190 --> 01:34:23.200
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it certainly seems very interesting that</v>

2118
01:34:23.230 --> 01:34:24.510
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's actually been able to,</v>

2119
01:34:24.550 --> 01:34:25.383
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to not only like delay Alzheimer's </v>

2120
01:34:27.281 --> 01:34:28.240
<v Speaker 2>disease,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but reverse it.</v>

2121
01:34:28.241 --> 01:34:29.074
<v Speaker 2>And this is Paul.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He has published a couple of published </v>

2122
01:34:30.791 --> 01:34:34.660
<v Speaker 2>studies where people were able to go </v>
<v Speaker 2>back to work and actually,</v>

2123
01:34:34.720 --> 01:34:35.560
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in some of the,</v>

2124
01:34:35.680 --> 01:34:36.513
<v Speaker 2>in some cases their brain atrophy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a kind of stopped and it started to </v>

2125
01:34:39.911 --> 01:34:42.400
<v Speaker 2>reverse where they were like growing </v>
<v Speaker 2>more neurons.</v>

2126
01:34:42.430 --> 01:34:43.330
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2127
01:34:43.331 --> 01:34:44.164
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I talked to him about this and so </v>

2128
01:34:45.611 --> 01:34:47.890
<v Speaker 2>the publication was like the original </v>
<v Speaker 2>one I had read,</v>

2129
01:34:48.010 --> 01:34:50.380
<v Speaker 2>which got me interested in his work in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the first place.</v>

2130
01:34:50.500 --> 01:34:51.430
<v Speaker 2>When I saw that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

2131
01:34:51.431 --> 01:34:52.660
<v Speaker 2>holy crap,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is amazing.</v>

2132
01:34:52.930 --> 01:34:54.880
<v Speaker 2>It was only on 10 patients.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was kind of low.</v>

2133
01:34:55.360 --> 01:34:57.920
<v Speaker 2>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now he's got like 50 more that there.</v>

2134
01:34:58.020 --> 01:34:58.853
<v Speaker 2>He's getting ready to publish and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got this whole protocol where </v>

2135
01:35:01.281 --> 01:35:03.270
<v Speaker 2>there's like just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got like thousands of,</v>

2136
01:35:03.340 --> 01:35:04.173
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of patients where they're like kind of </v>

2137
01:35:04.761 --> 01:35:06.290
<v Speaker 2>treating this sort of individual way.</v>

2138
01:35:06.500 --> 01:35:07.333
<v Speaker 2>They do genetic testing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blood testing and all that stuff as </v>

2139
01:35:08.691 --> 01:35:09.830
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2140
01:35:09.831 --> 01:35:11.930
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very interesting because it's,</v>

2141
01:35:12.020 --> 01:35:12.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>

2142
01:35:12.530 --> 01:35:15.620
<v Speaker 2>he's basically showing the important </v>
<v Speaker 2>interaction between diet,</v>

2143
01:35:15.621 --> 01:35:20.621
<v Speaker 2>lifestyle and potentially genetics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is kind of where my paper comes</v>

2144
01:35:21.141 --> 01:35:24.130
<v Speaker 2>in because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2145
01:35:24.180 --> 01:35:25.013
<v Speaker 2>there is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is a gene that increases the risk </v>

2146
01:35:28.641 --> 01:35:30.500
<v Speaker 2>for Alzheimer's if you have one copy of </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

2147
01:35:30.501 --> 01:35:32.810
<v Speaker 2>So you get two copies of every gene from</v>
<v Speaker 2>one from mom,</v>

2148
01:35:32.811 --> 01:35:33.644
<v Speaker 2>one from dad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you have one copy of it or increases </v>

2149
01:35:35.451 --> 01:35:37.610
<v Speaker 2>your risk for Alzheimer's disease by </v>
<v Speaker 2>like two to three fold,</v>

2150
01:35:37.670 --> 01:35:38.503
<v Speaker 2>you have two copies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It can be anywhere between 10 and 15 </v>

2151
01:35:39.831 --> 01:35:41.210
<v Speaker 2>fold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's like,</v>

2152
01:35:41.211 --> 01:35:42.044
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's called April before it also </v>

2153
01:35:43.431 --> 01:35:44.840
<v Speaker 2>increases the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2154
01:35:44.910 --> 01:35:48.650
<v Speaker 2>your chances of having a really poor </v>
<v Speaker 2>outcome if you have any type of Tbi,</v>

2155
01:35:48.920 --> 01:35:51.200
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and people with that that,</v>

2156
01:35:51.300 --> 01:35:51.830
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2157
01:35:51.830 --> 01:35:52.663
<v Speaker 2>Lele and have Tbi,</v>
<v Speaker 2>multiple tbis definitely are much more </v>

2158
01:35:56.541 --> 01:35:58.970
<v Speaker 2>likely to come down with some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>disease.</v>

2159
01:35:59.660 --> 01:36:00.500
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2160
01:36:00.530 --> 01:36:02.330
<v Speaker 2>but not everyone with it gets it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's like this,</v>

2161
01:36:02.331 --> 01:36:03.860
<v Speaker 2>like what's going on here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2162
01:36:03.861 --> 01:36:05.480
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there seems to be this clear,</v>

2163
01:36:05.870 --> 01:36:08.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gene environment interaction going on.</v>

2164
01:36:08.780 --> 01:36:09.850
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2165
01:36:10.430 --> 01:36:11.290
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2166
01:36:11.300 --> 01:36:12.133
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was really interested in this because I </v>

2167
01:36:13.311 --> 01:36:14.144
<v Speaker 2>found out I had one of these illegals </v>
<v Speaker 2>and of course that got me really </v>

2168
01:36:17.241 --> 01:36:18.740
<v Speaker 2>concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

2169
01:36:18.830 --> 01:36:19.663
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that's really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really important is sleep because sleep </v>

2170
01:36:22.221 --> 01:36:25.520
<v Speaker 2>is one of the ways you actually clear </v>
<v Speaker 2>away amyloid plaques from your brain.</v>

2171
01:36:25.640 --> 01:36:28.320
<v Speaker 2>Your brain actually swells during sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2172
01:36:28.350 --> 01:36:29.183
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you squirt cerebral spinal fluid into </v>

2173
01:36:31.071 --> 01:36:31.904
<v Speaker 2>your brain and you basically clean out </v>
<v Speaker 2>amyloid plaques and a bunch of other </v>

2174
01:36:34.311 --> 01:36:38.090
<v Speaker 2>gunk that's built up carwash for your </v>
<v Speaker 2>brain when you sleep.</v>

2175
01:36:38.150 --> 01:36:39.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2176
01:36:39.051 --> 01:36:39.884
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I talked about this with a former guest </v>

2177
01:36:40.851 --> 01:36:42.800
<v Speaker 2>here is Dr Matt Walker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We talked about it a lot.</v>

2178
01:36:42.830 --> 01:36:44.990
<v Speaker 2>He's like him and I were to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was awesome.</v>

2179
01:36:44.990 --> 01:36:45.570
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

2180
01:36:45.570 --> 01:36:47.270
<v Speaker 2>I could have talked to who's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>mindblower oh yeah.</v>

2181
01:36:47.480 --> 01:36:48.440
<v Speaker 2>I love,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love it.</v>

2182
01:36:48.830 --> 01:36:49.663
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really loved the conversation I had </v>

2183
01:36:51.351 --> 01:36:55.760
<v Speaker 2>with him so we talked about this in </v>
<v Speaker 2>detail because I'm basically,</v>

2184
01:36:56.270 --> 01:36:59.360
<v Speaker 2>that is one of the major ways you clear </v>
<v Speaker 2>amyloid plaques,</v>

2185
01:36:59.361 --> 01:37:04.361
<v Speaker 2>but the other way is through an Api we </v>
<v Speaker 2>mediated mechanism and April we for um,</v>

2186
01:37:05.090 --> 01:37:09.020
<v Speaker 2>does it like 20 fold less efficiently </v>
<v Speaker 2>than someone that doesn't have it.</v>

2187
01:37:09.240 --> 01:37:10.073
<v Speaker 2>And so they rely on sleep and there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>all sorts of studies with April before </v>

2188
01:37:12.650 --> 01:37:13.483
<v Speaker 2>showing sleep is a major modifiable risk</v>
<v Speaker 2>factor for Alzheimer's disease if you </v>

2189
01:37:18.141 --> 01:37:20.510
<v Speaker 2>have a boy before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're getting good quality sleep,</v>

2190
01:37:20.870 --> 01:37:23.090
<v Speaker 2>you have like the same risk as someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't have it.</v>

2191
01:37:23.540 --> 01:37:24.650
<v Speaker 2>And so I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gee,</v>

2192
01:37:24.651 --> 01:37:25.484
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course I was thinking about this the </v>

2193
01:37:26.081 --> 01:37:29.510
<v Speaker 2>entire time that had my son and I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>like not sleeping from us.</v>

2194
01:37:29.840 --> 01:37:31.080
<v Speaker 2>But anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2195
01:37:31.550 --> 01:37:33.290
<v Speaker 2>the other thing that I looked into in my</v>
<v Speaker 2>publication,</v>

2196
01:37:33.291 --> 01:37:34.330
<v Speaker 2>and this is where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2197
01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:35.833
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>another sort of diet gene interaction </v>

2198
01:37:37.431 --> 01:37:38.264
<v Speaker 2>comes in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that there's all sorts of clinical </v>

2199
01:37:39.741 --> 01:37:40.574
<v Speaker 2>studies showing that people with Apl,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we for benefit from fish eating fish </v>

2200
01:37:44.480 --> 01:37:47.840
<v Speaker 2>where they can basically have improved </v>
<v Speaker 2>pathology in their brain,</v>

2201
01:37:47.841 --> 01:37:51.150
<v Speaker 2>have improved symptoms of dementia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2202
01:37:51.200 --> 01:37:52.033
<v Speaker 2>but when they take fish oil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you take fish oil and give it to two </v>

2203
01:37:54.220 --> 01:37:56.910
<v Speaker 2>people with dementia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>only the people without April,</v>

2204
01:37:56.911 --> 01:38:00.300
<v Speaker 2>we for benefit for some reason the April</v>
<v Speaker 2>before people aren't benefiting.</v>

2205
01:38:00.900 --> 01:38:04.500
<v Speaker 2>And if you look into the literature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>animals that were given human apl,</v>

2206
01:38:04.501 --> 01:38:05.334
<v Speaker 2>we for versus Human April way three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Dha doesn't get transported across </v>

2207
01:38:10.141 --> 01:38:13.760
<v Speaker 2>the blood brain barrier very well with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2208
01:38:13.800 --> 01:38:15.240
<v Speaker 2>April before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's like,</v>

2209
01:38:15.241 --> 01:38:16.074
<v Speaker 2>what's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's some sort of transport defect </v>

2210
01:38:17.431 --> 01:38:19.170
<v Speaker 2>and Dha in the brain is really </v>
<v Speaker 2>important.</v>

2211
01:38:19.170 --> 01:38:21.930
<v Speaker 2>It's been shown to play an important </v>
<v Speaker 2>role in human studies,</v>

2212
01:38:21.931 --> 01:38:24.290
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of animal studies and human </v>
<v Speaker 2>studies that have been shown to,</v>

2213
01:38:24.630 --> 01:38:27.660
<v Speaker 2>to increase amyloid clearance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2214
01:38:27.661 --> 01:38:28.494
<v Speaker 2>it's in humans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's been shown to decrease the Tau </v>

2215
01:38:30.960 --> 01:38:32.430
<v Speaker 2>Tangles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And also,</v>

2216
01:38:32.431 --> 01:38:34.290
<v Speaker 2>it's really important for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2217
01:38:34.710 --> 01:38:37.470
<v Speaker 2>glucose uptake into the brain because it</v>
<v Speaker 2>regulates the transporters,</v>

2218
01:38:37.471 --> 01:38:39.190
<v Speaker 2>glucose transporters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was the second thing?</v>

2219
01:38:39.340 --> 01:38:40.860
<v Speaker 2>Tau.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tau Tangles.</v>

2220
01:38:40.861 --> 01:38:45.540
<v Speaker 2>So Tau Tangles form inside of neurons </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they disrupt,</v>

2221
01:38:45.600 --> 01:38:46.433
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a process that's called microtubule </v>

2222
01:38:49.500 --> 01:38:51.210
<v Speaker 2>transport,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is where basically it's,</v>

2223
01:38:51.270 --> 01:38:52.103
<v Speaker 2>it's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the neuron system for transporting </v>

2224
01:38:53.971 --> 01:38:55.650
<v Speaker 2>fatty acids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2225
01:38:55.710 --> 01:38:58.240
<v Speaker 2>all sorts of goodies energy to the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2226
01:38:58.290 --> 01:39:00.600
<v Speaker 2>to the synapse or synaptic transitions </v>
<v Speaker 2>happening.</v>

2227
01:39:01.100 --> 01:39:03.390
<v Speaker 2>And Tau tangles basically disrupt that </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole thing.</v>

2228
01:39:03.870 --> 01:39:08.870
<v Speaker 2>Amyloid plaques form outside of neurons </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the extracellular space and they can</v>

2229
01:39:09.271 --> 01:39:10.104
<v Speaker 2>disrupt synapse formation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're thought to form as a protective </v>

2230
01:39:14.101 --> 01:39:17.490
<v Speaker 2>mechanism against viral,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fungal or bacterial infection.</v>

2231
01:39:17.490 --> 01:39:18.940
<v Speaker 2>So it's Kinda like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2232
01:39:19.380 --> 01:39:20.213
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that's the reason why they're </v>

2233
01:39:20.671 --> 01:39:21.504
<v Speaker 2>forming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's just a matter of clearing them </v>

2234
01:39:22.741 --> 01:39:25.980
<v Speaker 2>out and also how your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how your brain is able to like deal with</v>

2235
01:39:25.981 --> 01:39:29.310
<v Speaker 2>amyloid plaque burden and April we is </v>
<v Speaker 2>not able to deal with it very well.</v>

2236
01:39:29.950 --> 01:39:30.783
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the Dha transport thing is basically </v>

2237
01:39:33.241 --> 01:39:34.500
<v Speaker 2>what I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I published is,</v>

2238
01:39:34.520 --> 01:39:35.353
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has to do with the interaction between </v>

2239
01:39:37.230 --> 01:39:39.000
<v Speaker 2>different forms of Dha and EPA.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>

2240
01:39:39.250 --> 01:39:40.083
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's two different ways that Dha is </v>

2241
01:39:41.431 --> 01:39:42.264
<v Speaker 2>transported across the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One is when it's like in a free fatty </v>

2242
01:39:44.551 --> 01:39:47.850
<v Speaker 2>acid form,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's bound to albumin and it requires an</v>

2243
01:39:47.851 --> 01:39:49.720
<v Speaker 2>intact blood brain barrier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2244
01:39:49.980 --> 01:39:53.160
<v Speaker 2>specifically the outer membrane of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>blood brain barrier needs to be intact.</v>

2245
01:39:53.550 --> 01:39:54.383
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2246
01:39:54.680 --> 01:39:56.700
<v Speaker 2>and because it goes through passive </v>
<v Speaker 2>diffusion,</v>

2247
01:39:56.910 --> 01:39:57.743
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if there's a disruption in the blood </v>

2248
01:39:59.011 --> 01:39:59.844
<v Speaker 2>brain barrier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then the Gha isn't going to be </v>

2249
01:40:00.781 --> 01:40:02.610
<v Speaker 2>transporting very well in that form.</v>

2250
01:40:03.150 --> 01:40:03.983
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's been shown that April before </v>

2251
01:40:06.660 --> 01:40:07.493
<v Speaker 2>actually disrupts that very thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the outer membrane of the tight </v>

2252
01:40:09.811 --> 01:40:13.230
<v Speaker 2>junctions that bind the outer membrane </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the endothelial cells that line,</v>

2253
01:40:13.231 --> 01:40:15.150
<v Speaker 2>the blood brain barrier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

2254
01:40:15.230 --> 01:40:16.320
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2255
01:40:16.350 --> 01:40:21.350
<v Speaker 2>it's quite possible that that is why Dha</v>
<v Speaker 2>is not getting into the brains very well</v>

2256
01:40:21.421 --> 01:40:22.141
<v Speaker 2>in April.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>

2257
01:40:22.141 --> 01:40:22.974
<v Speaker 2>for carriers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's another way to get it in and </v>

2258
01:40:24.511 --> 01:40:25.344
<v Speaker 2>this is through a transporter that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that uses something called </v>

2259
01:40:27.421 --> 01:40:28.254
<v Speaker 2>Lysophosphatidylcholine Dha,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a fossil liquid form of Dha </v>

2260
01:40:31.440 --> 01:40:33.450
<v Speaker 2>forms from phosphatidylcholine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dha,</v>

2261
01:40:34.230 --> 01:40:39.030
<v Speaker 2>the transporters called Mfs Dta.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it basically takes the Dha and flips</v>

2262
01:40:39.031 --> 01:40:40.770
<v Speaker 2>it down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2263
01:40:41.130 --> 01:40:41.963
<v Speaker 2>across the outer membrane,</v>
<v Speaker 2>into the inner membrane of the blood </v>

2264
01:40:43.681 --> 01:40:44.514
<v Speaker 2>brain barrier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it bypasses that outer membrane and </v>

2265
01:40:45.781 --> 01:40:47.760
<v Speaker 2>then it gets transported in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2266
01:40:48.240 --> 01:40:49.073
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you look at animal studies that you </v>

2267
01:40:50.910 --> 01:40:54.550
<v Speaker 2>delete that transporter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like 60 percent of the Dha,</v>

2268
01:40:54.551 --> 01:40:55.270
<v Speaker 2>Dha is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2269
01:40:55.270 --> 01:40:57.700
<v Speaker 2>not getting into the brain if you give,</v>
<v Speaker 2>give animals,</v>

2270
01:40:57.701 --> 01:40:59.590
<v Speaker 2>Dha humans with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2271
01:40:59.650 --> 01:41:00.483
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2272
01:41:00.670 --> 01:41:03.250
<v Speaker 2>a variation in that gene that makes it </v>
<v Speaker 2>less,</v>

2273
01:41:03.340 --> 01:41:05.520
<v Speaker 2>less active,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have get neurodegenerative,</v>

2274
01:41:05.521 --> 01:41:08.560
<v Speaker 2>a form of neurological disorders and </v>
<v Speaker 2>neurodegenerative disorders.</v>

2275
01:41:09.100 --> 01:41:10.890
<v Speaker 2>So it's obviously very important,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2276
01:41:11.170 --> 01:41:11.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

2277
01:41:11.730 --> 01:41:12.563
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to get Dha into the brain through that </v>

2278
01:41:14.260 --> 01:41:15.310
<v Speaker 2>mechanism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2279
01:41:15.311 --> 01:41:19.360
<v Speaker 2>it turns out if you consume Dha in </v>
<v Speaker 2>phospholipid form,</v>

2280
01:41:19.780 --> 01:41:23.890
<v Speaker 2>you actually form more of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Lysophosphatidylcholine Dha.</v>

2281
01:41:24.970 --> 01:41:29.260
<v Speaker 2>And that's because basically where the </v>
<v Speaker 2>djs are on a,</v>

2282
01:41:29.261 --> 01:41:30.190
<v Speaker 2>on a Phospho,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Libya,</v>

2283
01:41:30.191 --> 01:41:31.024
<v Speaker 2>they're in multiple carbons and one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>them can escape a lipase in the </v>

2284
01:41:34.660 --> 01:41:35.493
<v Speaker 2>pancreas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so basically you can form more of </v>

2285
01:41:36.761 --> 01:41:37.594
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2286
01:41:37.660 --> 01:41:40.840
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so for fossil liquid form djs and fish,</v>

2287
01:41:41.230 --> 01:41:44.390
<v Speaker 2>but it's really abundant in fish roe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like super abundant,</v>

2288
01:41:44.440 --> 01:41:48.910
<v Speaker 2>like 30 slash 70 percent of Dha that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>found in fish roe,</v>

2289
01:41:48.911 --> 01:41:53.140
<v Speaker 2>which are fish eggs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a variety of different kinds,</v>

2290
01:41:53.530 --> 01:41:54.363
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are impossible liquid form and you </v>

2291
01:41:56.200 --> 01:41:57.480
<v Speaker 2>consume that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

2292
01:41:57.520 --> 01:41:59.380
<v Speaker 2>that's the reason why I want to get to </v>
<v Speaker 2>talk about it.</v>

2293
01:41:59.740 --> 01:42:00.530
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I order my.</v>

2294
01:42:00.530 --> 01:42:02.530
<v Speaker 2>So you can like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get Salmon Roe,</v>

2295
01:42:02.620 --> 01:42:04.990
<v Speaker 2>I like the salmon because it also has </v>
<v Speaker 2>asked us anthon in it,</v>

2296
01:42:05.080 --> 01:42:06.100
<v Speaker 2>which is you order it.</v>

2297
01:42:06.100 --> 01:42:09.350
<v Speaker 2>Like is it bottled or canned or frozen?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Frozen.</v>

2298
01:42:09.540 --> 01:42:10.690
<v Speaker 2>It's frozen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I order it.</v>

2299
01:42:11.200 --> 01:42:13.270
<v Speaker 2>But you can go into like a Japanese </v>
<v Speaker 2>store,</v>

2300
01:42:13.271 --> 01:42:15.850
<v Speaker 2>you can get flying fish roe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which are much.</v>

2301
01:42:15.851 --> 01:42:18.520
<v Speaker 2>Some people prefer those because they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>smaller and the texture,</v>

2302
01:42:18.521 --> 01:42:20.850
<v Speaker 2>they don't like the Salmon Roe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the occur.</v>

2303
01:42:20.880 --> 01:42:22.870
<v Speaker 2>If you go to a Sushi restaurant and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>get like the,</v>

2304
01:42:23.260 --> 01:42:27.070
<v Speaker 2>like the shakes that come in like the </v>
<v Speaker 2>seaweed or have a bigger,</v>

2305
01:42:27.071 --> 01:42:29.140
<v Speaker 2>bigger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're bigger and they kind of know how</v>

2306
01:42:29.160 --> 01:42:30.760
<v Speaker 2>to use those for Bait.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2307
01:42:30.761 --> 01:42:31.594
<v Speaker 2>Some people don't like them because it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>like squish it and it's like liquid </v>

2308
01:42:34.691 --> 01:42:36.880
<v Speaker 2>coming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Great for catching rainbow trout,</v>

2309
01:42:37.450 --> 01:42:39.040
<v Speaker 2>rainbow trout,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rainbow trout,</v>

2310
01:42:39.041 --> 01:42:39.970
<v Speaker 2>eat salmon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eggs.</v>

2311
01:42:40.630 --> 01:42:42.340
<v Speaker 2>So I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm basically,</v>

2312
01:42:42.341 --> 01:42:43.510
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

2313
01:42:43.540 --> 01:42:45.970
<v Speaker 2>that's one way to get more phospholipid </v>
<v Speaker 2>form,</v>

2314
01:42:46.030 --> 01:42:49.630
<v Speaker 2>but also Dha consumed in like </v>
<v Speaker 2>triglyceride form,</v>

2315
01:42:49.631 --> 01:42:51.910
<v Speaker 2>which is what a lot of fish oil is also </v>
<v Speaker 2>forms.</v>

2316
01:42:52.120 --> 01:42:54.280
<v Speaker 2>It also forms Dha </v>
<v Speaker 2>Lysophosphatidylcholine,</v>

2317
01:42:54.820 --> 01:42:58.330
<v Speaker 2>but you just need more of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's also possible that some of these</v>

2318
01:42:58.331 --> 01:43:00.280
<v Speaker 2>clinical trials showing that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2319
01:43:00.330 --> 01:43:01.163
<v Speaker 2>fish oil failed was because they were </v>
<v Speaker 2>using like the dose they were using was </v>

2320
01:43:04.001 --> 01:43:06.250
<v Speaker 2>two grams.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So maybe you need six rams.</v>

2321
01:43:06.251 --> 01:43:07.084
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you need for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there any negative benefits or the </v>

2322
01:43:09.011 --> 01:43:11.710
<v Speaker 2>negative consequences of consuming too </v>
<v Speaker 2>much fish oil?</v>

2323
01:43:12.280 --> 01:43:12.950
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

2324
01:43:12.950 --> 01:43:13.783
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>certainly depends on the type of fish </v>

2325
01:43:15.311 --> 01:43:16.144
<v Speaker 2>oil that you're consuming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're consuming oxidized fish oils and </v>

2326
01:43:19.121 --> 01:43:19.954
<v Speaker 2>certainly not very good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but why would it be oxidized if it's </v>

2327
01:43:23.210 --> 01:43:25.000
<v Speaker 2>last,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it's too old,</v>

2328
01:43:25.210 --> 01:43:27.490
<v Speaker 2>it's too old and depending on how they </v>
<v Speaker 2>ice,</v>

2329
01:43:27.640 --> 01:43:29.410
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the isolation process was,</v>

2330
01:43:29.411 --> 01:43:30.790
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>too old for sure.</v>

2331
01:43:30.791 --> 01:43:34.210
<v Speaker 2>Things that are sitting around a </v>
<v Speaker 2>purification process is very important.</v>

2332
01:43:34.211 --> 01:43:35.920
<v Speaker 2>The purification.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2333
01:43:35.950 --> 01:43:37.000
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very important.</v>

2334
01:43:37.030 --> 01:43:37.863
<v Speaker 2>And like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's that fish oil standards program </v>

2335
01:43:39.971 --> 01:43:40.804
<v Speaker 2>you can look up and there's a variety of</v>
<v Speaker 2>different fish oil supplement brands </v>

2336
01:43:43.361 --> 01:43:44.194
<v Speaker 2>that are on there.</v>

2337
01:43:44.950 --> 01:43:47.470
<v Speaker 2>The other thing is like they was just </v>
<v Speaker 2>recently a randomized,</v>

2338
01:43:47.500 --> 01:43:48.333
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very large randomized controlled trial </v>

2339
01:43:49.421 --> 01:43:50.254
<v Speaker 2>published on four grams of one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>omega three fatty acids found in fish </v>

2340
01:43:55.401 --> 01:43:58.850
<v Speaker 2>and other marine organisms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>EPA and they were given four grams a day</v>

2341
01:43:58.851 --> 01:44:00.290
<v Speaker 2>for five years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>8,000</v>

2342
01:44:00.291 --> 01:44:01.610
<v Speaker 2>patients,</v>
<v Speaker 2>randomized,</v>

2343
01:44:01.611 --> 01:44:05.660
<v Speaker 2>placebo controlled different countries </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it reduced.</v>

2344
01:44:05.661 --> 01:44:09.110
<v Speaker 2>And these actually were patients that </v>
<v Speaker 2>had hypertrophic high triglycerides.</v>

2345
01:44:09.111 --> 01:44:09.944
<v Speaker 2>And also we're on Stanton's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it lowered cardiovascular disease risk </v>

2346
01:44:16.791 --> 01:44:19.760
<v Speaker 2>by like 28 or 30 percent or something </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that,</v>

2347
01:44:20.350 --> 01:44:21.183
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that was a high dose and that was </v>

2348
01:44:21.801 --> 01:44:24.740
<v Speaker 2>five years long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pretty pretty long followup.</v>

2349
01:44:24.800 --> 01:44:26.960
<v Speaker 2>And it was a randomized placebo </v>
<v Speaker 2>controlled study.</v>

2350
01:44:27.300 --> 01:44:30.140
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was called the vitals,</v>

2351
01:44:30.200 --> 01:44:32.920
<v Speaker 2>it bitlead study.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2352
01:44:33.320 --> 01:44:34.153
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the other thing that I think people are </v>

2353
01:44:35.211 --> 01:44:38.500
<v Speaker 2>worried about with really high dose fish</v>
<v Speaker 2>oil is um,</v>

2354
01:44:38.630 --> 01:44:39.463
<v Speaker 2>the potential for blood thinning because</v>
<v Speaker 2>it does inhibit thromboxanes and </v>

2355
01:44:43.071 --> 01:44:43.904
<v Speaker 2>prostoglandins and leukotrienes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>leukotrienes and things that are </v>

2356
01:44:45.621 --> 01:44:46.910
<v Speaker 2>important for like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2357
01:44:47.300 --> 01:44:48.133
<v Speaker 2>clotting.</v>

2358
01:44:48.320 --> 01:44:50.210
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2359
01:44:50.211 --> 01:44:54.740
<v Speaker 2>I've been taking a really high dose for </v>
<v Speaker 2>like over a decade,</v>

2360
01:44:54.880 --> 01:44:57.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>official I've been taking not always six</v>

2361
01:44:57.171 --> 01:44:58.004
<v Speaker 2>grams,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I've been taking a high dose for </v>

2362
01:44:59.181 --> 01:45:00.014
<v Speaker 2>quite a while.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How often do you get your blood work </v>

2363
01:45:01.161 --> 01:45:01.994
<v Speaker 2>done?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well recently I haven't been getting it </v>

2364
01:45:03.381 --> 01:45:04.214
<v Speaker 2>done very often because I'm the </v>
<v Speaker 2>pregnancy and breastfeeding and Cicero </v>

2365
01:45:07.461 --> 01:45:08.294
<v Speaker 2>changes things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I try to do it like it ideally like </v>

2366
01:45:11.300 --> 01:45:14.150
<v Speaker 2>doing it once a quarter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like a couple times a year for sure.</v>

2367
01:45:14.590 --> 01:45:17.070
<v Speaker 2>I'm probably troy six months.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

2368
01:45:17.140 --> 01:45:18.590
<v Speaker 2>that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

2369
01:45:18.591 --> 01:45:19.790
<v Speaker 2>I think like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2370
01:45:20.480 --> 01:45:22.700
<v Speaker 2>sometimes you can get super obsessive by</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing,</v>

2371
01:45:22.730 --> 01:45:24.380
<v Speaker 2>if you're doing it like once a quarter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2372
01:45:24.860 --> 01:45:25.693
<v Speaker 2>for people that are not healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think doing it once a quarter until </v>

2373
01:45:27.771 --> 01:45:29.220
<v Speaker 2>they start to get healthier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2374
01:45:29.480 --> 01:45:32.640
<v Speaker 1>Got It all dialed in to supplement with </v>
<v Speaker 1>Niacin at all.</v>

2375
01:45:33.290 --> 01:45:36.320
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't supplement with nice and um,</v>

2376
01:45:36.980 --> 01:45:40.160
<v Speaker 2>but I'm thinking about doing the </v>
<v Speaker 2>nicotinamide riboside,</v>

2377
01:45:40.370 --> 01:45:40.921
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nice.</v>

2378
01:45:40.921 --> 01:45:45.921
<v Speaker 2>And Ken that's been shown to like lower </v>
<v Speaker 2>ldl and they get hired at the stuff that</v>

2379
01:45:46.311 --> 01:45:47.810
<v Speaker 2>causes the flushing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2380
01:45:48.020 --> 01:45:48.853
<v Speaker 2>The stuff that causes a flushing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also I think that there were some </v>

2381
01:45:50.571 --> 01:45:53.510
<v Speaker 2>problems with it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like disrupting insulin,</v>

2382
01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:56.510
<v Speaker 2>something with insulin secretion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't recall.</v>

2383
01:45:56.511 --> 01:45:58.640
<v Speaker 2>It's been like so many years since I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>read those studies.</v>

2384
01:45:59.150 --> 01:45:59.983
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the nicotine nicotinamide riboside </v>

2385
01:46:01.850 --> 01:46:05.140
<v Speaker 2>beside forms Nad so Niacin is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>precursor for,</v>

2386
01:46:05.160 --> 01:46:05.993
<v Speaker 2>for Nad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is I'm also increased during </v>

2387
01:46:08.241 --> 01:46:08.920
<v Speaker 2>fasting.</v>

2388
01:46:08.920 --> 01:46:10.900
<v Speaker 1>We were going to get an,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a d,</v>

2389
01:46:10.970 --> 01:46:13.330
<v Speaker 1>a ivy injections.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We still got to do that.</v>

2390
01:46:13.331 --> 01:46:15.460
<v Speaker 1>Jeremy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that company contacted us.</v>

2391
01:46:15.800 --> 01:46:17.140
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's two ways of doing it.</v>

2392
01:46:17.141 --> 01:46:18.950
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it takes eight hours or two,</v>

2393
01:46:18.951 --> 01:46:23.951
<v Speaker 1>it takes like 10 to 15 minutes and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>excruciating pain.</v>

2394
01:46:24.310 --> 01:46:25.170
<v Speaker 1>It's excruciating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2395
01:46:25.180 --> 01:46:26.290
<v Speaker 1>they push it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2396
01:46:26.291 --> 01:46:27.124
<v Speaker 1>They push it through and it's just your </v>
<v Speaker 1>guts feel like they're on fire for like </v>

2397
01:46:30.671 --> 01:46:31.504
<v Speaker 1>10 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to try that just to see how bad </v>

2398
01:46:33.251 --> 01:46:36.370
<v Speaker 1>it is because I want to stay a long </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

2399
01:46:36.550 --> 01:46:37.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have eight hours.</v>

2400
01:46:38.270 --> 01:46:40.510
<v Speaker 1>That's not happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sitting around for eight hours,</v>

2401
01:46:40.810 --> 01:46:45.610
<v Speaker 1>but apparently there's some significant </v>
<v Speaker 1>benefits to ivy versions of it and doing</v>

2402
01:46:45.611 --> 01:46:46.444
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A Ben Greenfield was on the podcast </v>

2403
01:46:47.531 --> 01:46:49.740
<v Speaker 1>talking about it pretty much a pretty in</v>
<v Speaker 1>depth.</v>

2404
01:46:49.741 --> 01:46:50.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2405
01:46:50.040 --> 01:46:51.570
<v Speaker 2>He's a big believer of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2406
01:46:51.571 --> 01:46:52.404
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't find.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually tried finding some published </v>

2407
01:46:53.851 --> 01:46:57.870
<v Speaker 2>studies on the Ivy version.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really couldn't find any.</v>

2408
01:46:58.110 --> 01:46:58.943
<v Speaker 2>I take the time to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure it was recommended that </v>

2409
01:47:01.590 --> 01:47:03.270
<v Speaker 2>you recommended it to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2410
01:47:03.271 --> 01:47:05.010
<v Speaker 2>I subscribed to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get that stuff every day.</v>

2411
01:47:05.340 --> 01:47:07.350
<v Speaker 2>So that's um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there have been published studies,</v>

2412
01:47:07.380 --> 01:47:09.960
<v Speaker 2>clinical studies in humans on that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I take that stuff every day.</v>

2413
01:47:09.961 --> 01:47:10.794
<v Speaker 2>I like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2414
01:47:11.040 --> 01:47:11.670
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2415
01:47:11.670 --> 01:47:12.503
<v Speaker 1>I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know a lot of things I don't </v>

2416
01:47:14.191 --> 01:47:15.510
<v Speaker 1>really know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

2417
01:47:15.540 --> 01:47:16.373
<v Speaker 1>the NAD by intravenous method,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's supposed to be a much more potent </v>

2418
01:47:18.841 --> 01:47:19.674
<v Speaker 1>form of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the people that I know that have </v>

2419
01:47:21.031 --> 01:47:22.740
<v Speaker 1>tried it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the guys at on it,</v>

2420
01:47:22.770 --> 01:47:25.170
<v Speaker 1>they get a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone will come down to there,</v>

2421
01:47:25.470 --> 01:47:26.303
<v Speaker 1>the onnit labs like a couple times a </v>
<v Speaker 1>month and a bunch of the employees will </v>

2422
01:47:30.421 --> 01:47:31.920
<v Speaker 1>sign up and get zapped.</v>

2423
01:47:32.630 --> 01:47:33.463
<v Speaker 2>So I wonder why some of these guys don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>start gathering data and start </v>

2424
01:47:36.180 --> 01:47:38.140
<v Speaker 2>publishing because it'd be nice to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2425
01:47:38.380 --> 01:47:41.430
<v Speaker 2>To would be to see some data on that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2426
01:47:41.431 --> 01:47:44.430
<v Speaker 2>I wonder why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2427
01:47:44.450 --> 01:47:46.970
<v Speaker 2>a lot of times it's hard to get funding </v>
<v Speaker 2>for some of these things.</v>

2428
01:47:47.030 --> 01:47:48.440
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2429
01:47:48.470 --> 01:47:49.303
<v Speaker 2>who knows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it'd be interesting to see if it </v>

2430
01:47:50.211 --> 01:47:51.044
<v Speaker 2>has some of the similar benefits at </v>
<v Speaker 2>taking something like nicotinamide </v>

2431
01:47:53.001 --> 01:47:56.300
<v Speaker 2>riboside has where if you take like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>high enough dose you can,</v>

2432
01:47:56.330 --> 01:47:59.060
<v Speaker 2>you can raise your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your nad levels like dramatically.</v>

2433
01:47:59.120 --> 01:47:59.953
<v Speaker 2>Why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many of those at least tablets are </v>

2434
01:48:00.891 --> 01:48:01.724
<v Speaker 2>you taking on a daily basis?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I stopped taking them just right now </v>

2435
01:48:04.011 --> 01:48:05.600
<v Speaker 2>while I'm breastfeeding,</v>
<v Speaker 2>breastfeeding.</v>

2436
01:48:05.630 --> 01:48:07.840
<v Speaker 2>I'm just always on the cautious side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2437
01:48:08.330 --> 01:48:12.860
<v Speaker 2>I was taking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I was taking 250 milligrams.</v>

2438
01:48:12.890 --> 01:48:13.560
<v Speaker 2>I think</v>

2439
01:48:13.560 --> 01:48:15.730
<v Speaker 1>each pill is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2440
01:48:16.450 --> 01:48:17.720
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember,</v>

2441
01:48:18.350 --> 01:48:19.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2442
01:48:19.700 --> 01:48:23.120
<v Speaker 1>before I forgot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did want to ask you about it,</v>

2443
01:48:23.300 --> 01:48:27.110
<v Speaker 1>but when we butt dialing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but circling back to this whole carnival</v>

2444
01:48:27.111 --> 01:48:27.944
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the suggestions was that it </v>

2445
01:48:29.811 --> 01:48:33.170
<v Speaker 1>isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it possible that people,</v>

2446
01:48:33.320 --> 01:48:37.970
<v Speaker 1>that some small percentage of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>population would actually be allergic to</v>

2447
01:48:37.971 --> 01:48:38.840
<v Speaker 1>a lot of plants?</v>

2448
01:48:39.860 --> 01:48:41.510
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are people that can be allergic to</v>

2449
01:48:41.511 --> 01:48:43.220
<v Speaker 2>certain component.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's,</v>

2450
01:48:43.280 --> 01:48:46.880
<v Speaker 2>there's the whole night shade family I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think some people can,</v>

2451
01:48:46.881 --> 01:48:51.620
<v Speaker 2>like they have allergic reactions to and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that people with nightshades,</v>

2452
01:48:51.940 --> 01:48:53.180
<v Speaker 2>tomatoes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tomatoes,</v>

2453
01:48:54.260 --> 01:48:55.190
<v Speaker 2>peppers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>egg plant.</v>

2454
01:48:55.191 --> 01:48:56.024
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2455
01:48:56.270 --> 01:48:59.810
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then I also people with gut issues.</v>

2456
01:48:59.870 --> 01:49:00.760
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever heard of anyone</v>

2457
01:49:00.810 --> 01:49:01.590
<v Speaker 1>being allergic?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2458
01:49:01.590 --> 01:49:04.160
<v Speaker 1>so gut issues would predispose you to </v>
<v Speaker 1>being</v>

2459
01:49:04.230 --> 01:49:05.063
<v Speaker 2>well because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are other things in the plants </v>

2460
01:49:06.691 --> 01:49:08.050
<v Speaker 2>that can pop,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2461
01:49:08.280 --> 01:49:11.070
<v Speaker 2>so things people like to talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like lectins for example,</v>

2462
01:49:11.670 --> 01:49:14.100
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lectins there they are,</v>

2463
01:49:14.130 --> 01:49:16.710
<v Speaker 2>they are in a lot of plants but they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>much more concentrated.</v>

2464
01:49:16.711 --> 01:49:18.740
<v Speaker 2>Something like a legume,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a bean and,</v>

2465
01:49:18.850 --> 01:49:19.683
<v Speaker 2>and they're inactivated with heat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But typically most people don't have </v>

2466
01:49:24.331 --> 01:49:25.610
<v Speaker 2>reactions to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

2467
01:49:25.680 --> 01:49:30.030
<v Speaker 2>to lectins and possibly if they already </v>
<v Speaker 2>have some sort of gut barrier or problem</v>

2468
01:49:30.390 --> 01:49:33.150
<v Speaker 2>that could sort of elicit a reaction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

2469
01:49:33.151 --> 01:49:33.984
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of the data out there as in vitro </v>

2470
01:49:36.531 --> 01:49:39.210
<v Speaker 2>where lectins are used to stimulate the </v>
<v Speaker 2>immune system in vitro.</v>

2471
01:49:39.211 --> 01:49:40.044
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've used lectins before to do an </v>

2472
01:49:41.401 --> 01:49:43.110
<v Speaker 2>experiment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

2473
01:49:43.500 --> 01:49:44.191
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2474
01:49:44.191 --> 01:49:45.840
<v Speaker 2>so I think that yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

2475
01:49:45.930 --> 01:49:50.930
<v Speaker 2>there's certainly food allergies are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are definitely a possibility and they do</v>

2476
01:49:51.281 --> 01:49:51.850
<v Speaker 2>exist.</v>

2477
01:49:51.850 --> 01:49:52.683
<v Speaker 4>So is it possible that someone would be </v>
<v Speaker 4>allergic to both cruciferous vegetables </v>

2478
01:49:55.960 --> 01:49:57.570
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2479
01:49:57.580 --> 01:50:01.990
<v Speaker 4>a bunch of other like salary or </v>
<v Speaker 4>cucumbers or things along those lines?</v>

2480
01:50:02.670 --> 01:50:04.980
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if they're allergic to </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

2481
01:50:05.140 --> 01:50:08.010
<v Speaker 2>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that people can have,</v>

2482
01:50:08.100 --> 01:50:09.610
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2483
01:50:09.630 --> 01:50:10.463
<v Speaker 2>with like a variety of different issues </v>
<v Speaker 2>like small intestinal bacterial </v>

2484
01:50:13.111 --> 01:50:15.550
<v Speaker 2>overgrowth in their intestines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2485
01:50:15.750 --> 01:50:17.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that are,</v>

2486
01:50:17.220 --> 01:50:19.740
<v Speaker 2>that are sensitive to fodmaps,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those things.</v>

2487
01:50:19.741 --> 01:50:23.510
<v Speaker 2>So it's a fodmap for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have toast oligosaccharide like,</v>

2488
01:50:23.520 --> 01:50:27.330
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember what.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the basically people,</v>

2489
01:50:27.331 --> 01:50:30.090
<v Speaker 2>people can be sensitive to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're usually people with gut issues,</v>

2490
01:50:30.100 --> 01:50:33.580
<v Speaker 2>like boils down to gut issues.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Gut issues and I,</v>

2491
01:50:33.630 --> 01:50:34.463
<v Speaker 2>and that there certainly is some </v>
<v Speaker 2>cruciferous vegetables like cabbage or </v>

2492
01:50:38.941 --> 01:50:39.774
<v Speaker 2>something can affect people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can feel bloated and stuff like </v>

2493
01:50:41.821 --> 01:50:42.300
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2494
01:50:42.300 --> 01:50:43.133
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I do think that sometimes resolving </v>

2495
01:50:45.391 --> 01:50:48.480
<v Speaker 2>those gut issues will resolve that </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>

2496
01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:49.830
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

2497
01:50:49.830 --> 01:50:50.663
<v Speaker 2>I don't tend to think everyone's like </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone's going to be allergic to every </v>

2498
01:50:53.041 --> 01:50:55.050
<v Speaker 2>plant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know though.</v>

2499
01:50:55.051 --> 01:50:55.884
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2500
01:50:55.950 --> 01:50:57.050
<v Speaker 2>anything's possible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2501
01:50:57.700 --> 01:50:58.950
<v Speaker 2>There's no literature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no,</v>

2502
01:50:59.010 --> 01:50:59.843
<v Speaker 2>there's no come across any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I haven't done an in depth search </v>

2503
01:51:05.040 --> 01:51:06.270
<v Speaker 2>for that specific thing.</v>

2504
01:51:06.380 --> 01:51:07.213
<v Speaker 4>So is it fair to say that when people </v>
<v Speaker 4>are describing this and they're saying </v>

2505
01:51:10.910 --> 01:51:15.080
<v Speaker 4>that it might be possible that there are</v>
<v Speaker 4>a small percentage of the population,</v>

2506
01:51:15.200 --> 01:51:18.410
<v Speaker 4>are there is a small percentage of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>population that's allergic to plants,</v>

2507
01:51:18.620 --> 01:51:19.453
<v Speaker 4>that really what you're dealing with as </v>
<v Speaker 4>a small percentage of population that </v>

2508
01:51:22.221 --> 01:51:23.054
<v Speaker 4>has a significantly impaired gut biome </v>
<v Speaker 4>that is finding benefit to eliminating </v>

2509
01:51:28.011 --> 01:51:28.844
<v Speaker 4>these plants,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this strict elimination diet being on </v>

2510
01:51:30.771 --> 01:51:34.820
<v Speaker 4>this carnivore diet which also has </v>
<v Speaker 4>calorie restrictive aspects to it,</v>

2511
01:51:34.821 --> 01:51:35.654
<v Speaker 4>and even fasting restricted restricted </v>
<v Speaker 4>aspects to it that this is why they're </v>

2512
01:51:39.021 --> 01:51:39.854
<v Speaker 4>experiencing this positive benefit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that perhaps one of the ways they </v>

2513
01:51:44.781 --> 01:51:45.614
<v Speaker 4>could fix their gut biome would be some </v>
<v Speaker 4>sort of prolonged fast or something </v>

2514
01:51:50.030 --> 01:51:50.863
<v Speaker 4>along those lines to try to fix the </v>
<v Speaker 4>problem at the root source instead of </v>

2515
01:51:56.300 --> 01:51:59.030
<v Speaker 4>maybe what the carnivore diet would be </v>
<v Speaker 4>as like some sort of a,</v>

2516
01:51:59.090 --> 01:52:00.740
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a dietary bandaid.</v>

2517
01:52:00.840 --> 01:52:02.970
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that the study I was talking</v>

2518
01:52:02.971 --> 01:52:07.740
<v Speaker 2>about the 15 day intermittent fast for </v>
<v Speaker 2>were people with autoimmune disease.</v>

2519
01:52:07.741 --> 01:52:09.540
<v Speaker 2>We're fasted for 24 hours every other </v>
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>

2520
01:52:10.500 --> 01:52:11.333
<v Speaker 2>They had changes in their microbiome </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we're in line of very interesting </v>

2521
01:52:15.391 --> 01:52:18.870
<v Speaker 2>changes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They actually grew bacteria that are,</v>

2522
01:52:18.940 --> 01:52:19.681
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2523
01:52:19.681 --> 01:52:20.370
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2524
01:52:20.370 --> 01:52:23.400
<v Speaker 2>important for producing things like </v>
<v Speaker 2>butyrate,</v>

2525
01:52:23.940 --> 01:52:25.410
<v Speaker 2>which makes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2526
01:52:25.530 --> 01:52:26.363
<v Speaker 2>helps make t regulatory cells at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>signaling molecule that helps your </v>

2527
01:52:29.401 --> 01:52:33.330
<v Speaker 2>immune system produce more t regulatory </v>
<v Speaker 2>immune cells.</v>

2528
01:52:33.510 --> 01:52:35.970
<v Speaker 2>It also something that comes from a </v>
<v Speaker 2>state of Ketosis as well.</v>

2529
01:52:36.110 --> 01:52:37.110
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well this.</v>

2530
01:52:37.111 --> 01:52:37.801
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

2531
01:52:37.801 --> 01:52:38.611
<v Speaker 2>They were fasting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2532
01:52:38.611 --> 01:52:39.444
<v Speaker 2>And the thing that was so interesting </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's a question I had had for so </v>

2533
01:52:41.611 --> 01:52:42.444
<v Speaker 2>long,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like what happens the microbiome </v>

2534
01:52:44.461 --> 01:52:47.650
<v Speaker 2>when you don't eat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like is it to start,</v>

2535
01:52:47.660 --> 01:52:48.493
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you getting like a selection for </v>

2536
01:52:49.761 --> 01:52:50.594
<v Speaker 2>mucin degrading bacteria which are </v>
<v Speaker 2>degrading a certain glycoproteins that </v>

2537
01:52:53.031 --> 01:52:53.780
<v Speaker 2>lines the gut.</v>

2538
01:52:53.780 --> 01:52:54.613
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the thing that was so interesting </v>

2539
01:52:56.331 --> 01:53:00.470
<v Speaker 2>about this study was that they did this </v>
<v Speaker 2>like metogenomic analysis and they found</v>

2540
01:53:00.650 --> 01:53:04.790
<v Speaker 2>from fecal samples that P,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the gene in the,</v>

2541
01:53:04.820 --> 01:53:05.653
<v Speaker 2>within the existing microbiome,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was increasing the production of </v>

2542
01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:11.400
<v Speaker 2>ketone bodies themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was fueling because your,</v>

2543
01:53:11.470 --> 01:53:13.190
<v Speaker 2>your gut cells,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your gut cells,</v>

2544
01:53:13.191 --> 01:53:14.780
<v Speaker 2>and also a lot of the beneficial </v>
<v Speaker 2>bacteria,</v>

2545
01:53:15.050 --> 01:53:17.330
<v Speaker 2>like things like butyrate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lactate,</v>

2546
01:53:17.820 --> 01:53:19.230
<v Speaker 2>appropriate Acetate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2547
01:53:19.280 --> 01:53:20.930
<v Speaker 2>these are some of the short chain fatty </v>
<v Speaker 2>acids.</v>

2548
01:53:20.931 --> 01:53:22.670
<v Speaker 2>Buda rates like the big one of the gut </v>
<v Speaker 2>for the gut,</v>

2549
01:53:22.800 --> 01:53:23.690
<v Speaker 2>like gut cells,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2550
01:53:24.080 --> 01:53:26.600
<v Speaker 2>like an 80 or 90 percent are like using </v>
<v Speaker 2>butyrate.</v>

2551
01:53:26.950 --> 01:53:29.540
<v Speaker 2>But fasting was increasing all these </v>
<v Speaker 2>ketone bodies.</v>

2552
01:53:29.990 --> 01:53:32.450
<v Speaker 2>So it's kind of really interesting </v>
<v Speaker 2>because for one,</v>

2553
01:53:32.451 --> 01:53:33.070
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

2554
01:53:33.070 --> 01:53:34.760
<v Speaker 2>it helped and it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it basically,</v>

2555
01:53:34.761 --> 01:53:36.170
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2556
01:53:36.200 --> 01:53:39.350
<v Speaker 2>increased the diversity of this </v>
<v Speaker 2>beneficial bacteria.</v>

2557
01:53:39.351 --> 01:53:41.840
<v Speaker 2>It was very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't have guessed that.</v>

2558
01:53:42.140 --> 01:53:43.120
<v Speaker 2>Have there been asking,</v>

2559
01:53:43.200 --> 01:53:44.033
<v Speaker 1>have there been any studies on </v>
<v Speaker 1>consumption of exoticness ketones to </v>

2560
01:53:47.880 --> 01:53:49.080
<v Speaker 1>benefit the gut biome?</v>

2561
01:53:49.470 --> 01:53:51.040
<v Speaker 2>Not that I'm aware of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2562
01:53:51.200 --> 01:53:53.190
<v Speaker 2>do you think that that would mirror it </v>
<v Speaker 2>in any way?</v>

2563
01:53:54.030 --> 01:53:54.863
<v Speaker 2>That's a very interesting question </v>
<v Speaker 2>because most of the exogenous would be </v>

2564
01:53:58.171 --> 01:54:01.950
<v Speaker 2>like a Beta hydroxybutyrate ester.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

2565
01:54:02.100 --> 01:54:02.933
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the question would be how similar is </v>

2566
01:54:05.521 --> 01:54:07.100
<v Speaker 2>Beta hydroxy butyrate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Butyrate,</v>

2567
01:54:07.620 --> 01:54:08.660
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because Peter rates what,</v>

2568
01:54:08.800 --> 01:54:12.090
<v Speaker 2>what we're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a very interesting question.</v>

2569
01:54:12.300 --> 01:54:13.980
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2570
01:54:14.040 --> 01:54:15.750
<v Speaker 2>I mean that would be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or even what,</v>

2571
01:54:15.800 --> 01:54:17.850
<v Speaker 2>what's happening during,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2572
01:54:18.900 --> 01:54:21.150
<v Speaker 2>during like a ketogenic diet as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2573
01:54:21.210 --> 01:54:22.043
<v Speaker 2>You're making,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a lot of circulating Beta </v>

2574
01:54:23.011 --> 01:54:24.090
<v Speaker 2>hydroxy butyrate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that,</v>

2575
01:54:25.010 --> 01:54:27.300
<v Speaker 2>does that get to the gut and is there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

2576
01:54:27.330 --> 01:54:30.060
<v Speaker 2>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's another interesting question.</v>

2577
01:54:30.110 --> 01:54:32.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it is an interesting way to hack</v>

2578
01:54:32.061 --> 01:54:32.894
<v Speaker 1>your system is that these exemptions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ketones like a key gen x or that's one </v>

2579
01:54:36.231 --> 01:54:39.260
<v Speaker 1>that I use for a few other companies </v>
<v Speaker 1>that make these.</v>

2580
01:54:39.261 --> 01:54:41.420
<v Speaker 1>They do put your body in a state of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ketosis.</v>

2581
01:54:41.720 --> 01:54:42.171
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2582
01:54:42.171 --> 01:54:43.880
<v Speaker 2>I've definitely tried.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've tried one,</v>

2583
01:54:44.270 --> 01:54:45.710
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from,</v>

2584
01:54:45.740 --> 01:54:50.510
<v Speaker 2>from hpm n the Beta hydroxybutyrate </v>
<v Speaker 2>Ester and um,</v>

2585
01:54:51.110 --> 01:54:51.920
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2586
01:54:51.920 --> 01:54:54.900
<v Speaker 2>it definitely like gives me energy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2587
01:54:54.980 --> 01:54:58.190
<v Speaker 2>but the other thing I really liked was </v>
<v Speaker 2>the mental effects,</v>

2588
01:54:58.191 --> 01:55:00.170
<v Speaker 2>the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing about it.</v>

2589
01:55:00.200 --> 01:55:01.610
<v Speaker 2>So a couple,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a sort of,</v>

2590
01:55:01.640 --> 01:55:06.640
<v Speaker 2>it's sort of a double edge sword because</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel less anxious when I take it.</v>

2591
01:55:07.041 --> 01:55:08.840
<v Speaker 2>And this was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is getting me up until like,</v>

2592
01:55:08.930 --> 01:55:12.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>four point five millimolar,</v>

2593
01:55:12.200 --> 01:55:14.780
<v Speaker 2>Beta hydroxybutyrate in like an hour </v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] I,</v>

2594
01:55:14.850 --> 01:55:17.930
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel less anxious and more full,</v>

2595
01:55:17.970 --> 01:55:20.600
<v Speaker 2>more in the present.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm more present and not like,</v>

2596
01:55:21.100 --> 01:55:22.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a million things ahead.</v>

2597
01:55:22.881 --> 01:55:25.060
<v Speaker 2>Whereas like sometimes my brain goes </v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2598
01:55:25.080 --> 01:55:26.190
<v Speaker 2>So I felt like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2599
01:55:26.260 --> 01:55:27.880
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is something that like,</v>

2600
01:55:28.100 --> 01:55:29.880
<v Speaker 2>like Dan observed with me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2601
01:55:29.930 --> 01:55:33.770
<v Speaker 2>because I felt this more than once I </v>
<v Speaker 2>started using it.</v>

2602
01:55:33.770 --> 01:55:36.680
<v Speaker 2>I started using,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't use it today but the reason why</v>

2603
01:55:36.681 --> 01:55:37.514
<v Speaker 2>I didn't use it today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I started using it for podcast or </v>

2604
01:55:40.941 --> 01:55:41.774
<v Speaker 2>being talks or anything like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the reason I didn't use it today is </v>

2605
01:55:45.781 --> 01:55:50.400
<v Speaker 2>because the flip side is it dramatically</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I'm not in Ketosis,</v>

2606
01:55:50.401 --> 01:55:54.300
<v Speaker 2>I'm not on a ketogenic diet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it lowers my blood sugar levels,</v>

2607
01:55:54.330 --> 01:55:57.450
<v Speaker 2>like really dramatically and this has </v>
<v Speaker 2>been published,</v>

2608
01:55:57.600 --> 01:55:58.433
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's like mechanisms that are trying </v>

2609
01:55:59.581 --> 01:56:00.414
<v Speaker 2>to be explored to understanding why that</v>
<v Speaker 2>is and possibly as a therapeutic </v>

2610
01:56:03.301 --> 01:56:05.250
<v Speaker 2>treatment for type two diabetes and </v>
<v Speaker 2>things like that.</v>

2611
01:56:05.760 --> 01:56:07.020
<v Speaker 2>But so if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once the,</v>

2612
01:56:07.050 --> 01:56:10.980
<v Speaker 2>once the ketones were off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which they do after a couple of hours,</v>

2613
01:56:11.490 --> 01:56:12.323
<v Speaker 2>I'd crash because my blood glucose is </v>
<v Speaker 2>low and I don't have the ketones there </v>

2614
01:56:15.541 --> 01:56:16.560
<v Speaker 2>to compensate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2615
01:56:16.650 --> 01:56:19.200
<v Speaker 2>Whereas if I was already in Ketosis </v>
<v Speaker 2>then,</v>

2616
01:56:19.730 --> 01:56:20.563
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wouldn't matter because I'd already </v>

2617
01:56:21.710 --> 01:56:23.420
<v Speaker 2>had been in Ketosis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>

2618
01:56:23.520 --> 01:56:24.151
<v Speaker 2>I see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2619
01:56:24.151 --> 01:56:25.080
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

2620
01:56:25.081 --> 01:56:26.310
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2621
01:56:26.311 --> 01:56:28.350
<v Speaker 2>it's really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The effects on the brain.</v>

2622
01:56:28.351 --> 01:56:29.184
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2623
01:56:29.970 --> 01:56:31.770
<v Speaker 2>it's something that I noticed and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>certainly,</v>

2624
01:56:31.830 --> 01:56:35.140
<v Speaker 2>I'm like repeatedly noticed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2625
01:56:35.250 --> 01:56:37.860
<v Speaker 1>what would be the mechanism that would </v>
<v Speaker 1>allow you to be more present?</v>

2626
01:56:38.070 --> 01:56:38.903
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that seems so strange that that would </v>

2627
01:56:40.170 --> 01:56:42.010
<v Speaker 1>have less anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2628
01:56:42.060 --> 01:56:43.350
<v Speaker 1>what would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would cause that?</v>

2629
01:56:43.660 --> 01:56:45.460
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's,</v>

2630
01:56:46.120 --> 01:56:46.953
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>possibly the glucose is being spared in </v>

2631
01:56:48.791 --> 01:56:50.710
<v Speaker 2>my brain for other things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

2632
01:56:50.830 --> 01:56:52.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because now the Ketone,</v>

2633
01:56:52.200 --> 01:56:53.033
<v Speaker 2>the Beta hydroxy is being used as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>source of energy and glucose is being </v>

2634
01:56:55.841 --> 01:56:57.610
<v Speaker 2>used.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean liquid sparing does occur,</v>

2635
01:56:57.980 --> 01:56:58.813
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of times in the context of making </v>

2636
01:57:00.851 --> 01:57:01.684
<v Speaker 2>more glutathione because that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>glucose's can be used for energy or it </v>

2637
01:57:05.351 --> 01:57:06.184
<v Speaker 2>can be used to make glutathione and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>pathway that does that is through a </v>

2638
01:57:09.371 --> 01:57:13.750
<v Speaker 2>pathway called the pentose phosphate </v>
<v Speaker 2>shunt and that pathway takes glucose and</v>

2639
01:57:13.751 --> 01:57:16.330
<v Speaker 2>make something called any dph,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is then used,</v>

2640
01:57:16.420 --> 01:57:18.450
<v Speaker 2>which isn't necessary to make </v>
<v Speaker 2>glutathione.</v>

2641
01:57:19.090 --> 01:57:21.010
<v Speaker 2>So I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe there's some kind of,</v>

2642
01:57:21.340 --> 01:57:22.180
<v Speaker 2>some.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you know,</v>

2643
01:57:22.181 --> 01:57:23.014
<v Speaker 2>what else does it for me so far?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fain sulforaphane gives me major anti </v>

2644
01:57:27.751 --> 01:57:31.660
<v Speaker 2>anxiety effects and like cognitive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I feel Broccoli sprouts,</v>

2645
01:57:31.720 --> 01:57:32.553
<v Speaker 2>consumers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which does affect Gludethyon in the </v>

2646
01:57:33.911 --> 01:57:34.780
<v Speaker 2>brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2647
01:57:34.781 --> 01:57:37.120
<v Speaker 2>I never thought about them anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all hypothetical.</v>

2648
01:57:37.300 --> 01:57:41.110
<v Speaker 1>What about I'm consuming those exogenous</v>
<v Speaker 1>ketones with glutathione?</v>

2649
01:57:41.800 --> 01:57:43.900
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever tried that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know those existed.</v>

2650
01:57:44.110 --> 01:57:45.130
<v Speaker 1>I mean trying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2651
01:57:45.131 --> 01:57:47.170
<v Speaker 1>you mean with the Broccoli sprouts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Broccoli sprouts.</v>

2652
01:57:47.171 --> 01:57:47.931
<v Speaker 1>You mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2653
01:57:47.931 --> 01:57:50.830
<v Speaker 1>well you're saying glutosiome increases </v>
<v Speaker 1>glutathione in the brain,</v>

2654
01:57:50.831 --> 01:57:52.580
<v Speaker 1>but what about a glutosiome supplemental</v>

2655
01:57:52.660 --> 01:57:54.900
<v Speaker 2>gludethyon supplements?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Glutathione,</v>

2656
01:57:55.990 --> 01:57:57.670
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it gets destroyed in the gut,</v>

2657
01:57:57.671 --> 01:57:59.570
<v Speaker 2>but like even if your were to get it </v>
<v Speaker 2>into your,</v>

2658
01:57:59.910 --> 01:58:03.100
<v Speaker 2>your bloodstream,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no transporter for glue to found</v>

2659
01:58:03.101 --> 01:58:07.000
<v Speaker 2>to get into cells.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you want to make,</v>

2660
01:58:07.030 --> 01:58:07.863
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can get the precursors to make it </v>

2661
01:58:08.981 --> 01:58:10.960
<v Speaker 2>and you can increase the way Broccoli </v>
<v Speaker 2>sprouts does.</v>

2662
01:58:10.961 --> 01:58:14.410
<v Speaker 2>It is increases enzymes that make it so </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're making more.</v>

2663
01:58:14.411 --> 01:58:15.400
<v Speaker 2>And so that's how you do it.</v>

2664
01:58:15.610 --> 01:58:16.443
<v Speaker 1>So when you see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so one of the things that glutathione </v>

2665
01:58:19.991 --> 01:58:23.560
<v Speaker 1>does is it helps your body processes </v>
<v Speaker 1>alcohol,</v>

2666
01:58:23.561 --> 01:58:24.394
<v Speaker 1>correct?</v>

2667
01:58:25.880 --> 01:58:26.920
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

2668
01:58:26.921 --> 01:58:28.380
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a power plant.</v>

2669
01:58:28.381 --> 01:58:29.050
<v Speaker 2>Oxidant</v>

2670
01:58:29.050 --> 01:58:30.930
<v Speaker 1>wasn't that what Mark Gordon talked </v>
<v Speaker 1>about?</v>

2671
01:58:31.860 --> 01:58:32.671
<v Speaker 1>Lipos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somo.</v>

2672
01:58:32.671 --> 01:58:35.730
<v Speaker 1>Gludethyon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

2673
01:58:36.690 --> 01:58:37.523
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lyposomal glutathione thigh on helps </v>

2674
01:58:39.181 --> 01:58:41.350
<v Speaker 1>your body with the,</v>

2675
01:58:42.500 --> 01:58:45.410
<v Speaker 2>the processing of alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a very,</v>

2676
01:58:45.440 --> 01:58:49.310
<v Speaker 2>very strong um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and toxin antioxidant.</v>

2677
01:58:49.340 --> 01:58:50.360
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2678
01:58:50.390 --> 01:58:53.330
<v Speaker 2>but it gets destroyed in your gut.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you're taking it.</v>

2679
01:58:53.331 --> 01:58:54.164
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2680
01:58:54.410 --> 01:58:57.740
<v Speaker 2>And also go to thumb doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't get into yourself.</v>

2681
01:58:58.820 --> 01:59:01.580
<v Speaker 2>There's a video about it from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from this podcast.</v>

2682
01:59:01.670 --> 01:59:02.930
<v Speaker 2>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there you go.</v>

2683
01:59:03.470 --> 01:59:04.303
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2684
01:59:05.310 --> 01:59:06.143
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was something about the processing </v>

2685
01:59:08.311 --> 01:59:11.170
<v Speaker 4>of alcohol now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if,</v>

2686
01:59:11.520 --> 01:59:12.353
<v Speaker 4>how would it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the best way to get it would be </v>

2687
01:59:13.591 --> 01:59:16.710
<v Speaker 4>through sulforaphane from Broccoli </v>
<v Speaker 4>sprouts,</v>

2688
01:59:16.740 --> 01:59:19.890
<v Speaker 4>cruciferous vegetables,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then your body would produce more.</v>

2689
01:59:19.950 --> 01:59:20.650
<v Speaker 2>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So from the,</v>

2690
01:59:20.650 --> 01:59:23.250
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the human studies that I've referenced,</v>

2691
01:59:23.590 --> 01:59:26.730
<v Speaker 2>one was 300 grams of Brussels sprouts a </v>
<v Speaker 2>day,</v>

2692
01:59:26.731 --> 01:59:29.400
<v Speaker 2>increased it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go to gludethyon on plasma by Fort One,</v>

2693
01:59:29.401 --> 01:59:31.770
<v Speaker 2>point four fold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other study.</v>

2694
01:59:31.771 --> 01:59:32.604
<v Speaker 2>I'm more recently that showed an </v>
<v Speaker 2>increase in plasma as well as in the </v>

2695
01:59:35.641 --> 01:59:38.460
<v Speaker 2>brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was a sulfur,</v>

2696
01:59:38.640 --> 01:59:41.340
<v Speaker 2>that was a broccoli sprout extract that </v>
<v Speaker 2>was given.</v>

2697
01:59:41.350 --> 01:59:44.400
<v Speaker 2>I don't have the dose on My instagram,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

2698
01:59:44.401 --> 01:59:45.750
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking about the dose,</v>

2699
01:59:46.080 --> 01:59:49.110
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's one of the ways I know of,</v>

2700
01:59:49.240 --> 01:59:50.073
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the most powerful ways I know of </v>

2701
01:59:51.151 --> 01:59:55.410
<v Speaker 2>to increase glutathione and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>basically in humans.</v>

2702
01:59:55.890 --> 01:59:58.980
<v Speaker 2>So I don't know how much 300 grams of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Brussel sprouts is.</v>

2703
01:59:59.280 --> 02:00:01.800
<v Speaker 4>So what would be a good idea?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2704
02:00:01.950 --> 02:00:05.660
<v Speaker 4>pressure from wrong would be a large </v>
<v Speaker 4>dose of Electra,</v>

2705
02:00:05.700 --> 02:00:06.533
<v Speaker 4>large plate of Brussels sprouts with a </v>
<v Speaker 4>or Broccoli sprouts with some sort of a </v>

2706
02:00:13.380 --> 02:00:14.940
<v Speaker 4>ketone supplement</v>

2707
02:00:15.300 --> 02:00:16.133
<v Speaker 2>or if you're doing a pure in Ketosis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether that's fasting time restricted </v>

2708
02:00:19.091 --> 02:00:20.860
<v Speaker 2>eating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's something that I do.</v>

2709
02:00:20.861 --> 02:00:24.580
<v Speaker 2>So I am definitely trying to get my </v>
<v Speaker 2>ketosis in or you're on a ketogenic diet</v>

2710
02:00:24.581 --> 02:00:26.680
<v Speaker 2>and you're getting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the question is,</v>

2711
02:00:27.580 --> 02:00:28.413
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure the glucose sparing stuff </v>

2712
02:00:31.511 --> 02:00:32.344
<v Speaker 2>that's been shown in animal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I don't know how much of that is </v>

2713
02:00:35.320 --> 02:00:37.420
<v Speaker 2>translatable to humans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What effect,</v>

2714
02:00:37.421 --> 02:00:38.254
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you always have to have evidence to say </v>

2715
02:00:39.401 --> 02:00:41.840
<v Speaker 2>something definitively,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>

2716
02:00:42.250 --> 02:00:43.083
<v Speaker 2>animal studies do show that there is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>glucose sparing effect when you have </v>

2717
02:00:46.930 --> 02:00:48.710
<v Speaker 2>ketone bodies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2718
02:00:49.120 --> 02:00:50.590
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2719
02:00:50.830 --> 02:00:52.420
<v Speaker 2>just fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was fascinating.</v>

2720
02:00:52.421 --> 02:00:55.360
<v Speaker 2>That will make you more present.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2721
02:00:55.750 --> 02:00:56.583
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's fascinating is that sulforaphane </v>

2722
02:00:58.300 --> 02:01:00.310
<v Speaker 2>treats autistic symptoms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2723
02:01:00.370 --> 02:01:01.061
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2724
02:01:01.061 --> 02:01:02.140
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2725
02:01:02.230 --> 02:01:02.891
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2726
02:01:02.891 --> 02:01:03.724
<v Speaker 2>So what's going on there is definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's also been an open label </v>

2727
02:01:06.221 --> 02:01:09.490
<v Speaker 2>study,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there has been two trials with two or</v>

2728
02:01:09.491 --> 02:01:10.324
<v Speaker 2>maybe three and Dr Jed Fahy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's been a part of this as well as his </v>

2729
02:01:12.791 --> 02:01:15.880
<v Speaker 2>colleagues,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a randomized placebo controlled and open</v>

2730
02:01:15.881 --> 02:01:16.714
<v Speaker 2>label,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is always less open label means </v>

2731
02:01:18.671 --> 02:01:19.504
<v Speaker 2>there wasn't a placebo control,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they didn't measure metabolites of </v>

2732
02:01:23.300 --> 02:01:26.080
<v Speaker 2>sulfur,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sulfur of pain and also oxidative stress</v>

2733
02:01:26.100 --> 02:01:27.490
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in plasma,</v>

2734
02:01:27.520 --> 02:01:28.353
<v Speaker 2>which always helps.</v>

2735
02:01:28.700 --> 02:01:29.533
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then there's been a trial and </v>

2736
02:01:30.260 --> 02:01:32.590
<v Speaker 2>schizophrenia patients,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so for a grant helps with that as well.</v>

2737
02:01:32.591 --> 02:01:33.424
<v Speaker 2>That was open label.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right now there's an ongoing placebo </v>

2738
02:01:35.111 --> 02:01:37.660
<v Speaker 2>controlled trial that's now taking </v>
<v Speaker 2>place.</v>

2739
02:01:38.170 --> 02:01:40.100
<v Speaker 2>So there's very interesting</v>

2740
02:01:40.100 --> 02:01:42.710
<v Speaker 3>effects on the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2741
02:01:42.920 --> 02:01:46.490
<v Speaker 3>it seems as though there is some </v>
<v Speaker 3>oxidative stress component,</v>

2742
02:01:47.060 --> 02:01:47.890
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a,</v>

2743
02:01:47.890 --> 02:01:50.510
<v Speaker 3>we for who knows how much,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2744
02:01:50.560 --> 02:01:55.560
<v Speaker 3>their oxidative stress may be happening </v>
<v Speaker 3>more in my brain because of we for um,</v>

2745
02:01:55.970 --> 02:01:58.910
<v Speaker 3>there's certainly increased risk for </v>
<v Speaker 3>Alzheimer's disease,</v>

2746
02:01:58.911 --> 02:01:59.880
<v Speaker 3>increase,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2747
02:02:00.020 --> 02:02:01.850
<v Speaker 3>the traumatic brain injury,</v>
<v Speaker 3>poor outcome,</v>

2748
02:02:01.851 --> 02:02:02.684
<v Speaker 3>all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's all this evidence that sort of </v>

2749
02:02:03.111 --> 02:02:06.370
<v Speaker 3>shows that don't start boxing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Definitely not kickboxing.</v>

2750
02:02:07.310 --> 02:02:08.143
<v Speaker 3>So do you think that mean it seems like </v>
<v Speaker 3>a perfect pre podcast meal would be </v>

2751
02:02:13.101 --> 02:02:15.210
<v Speaker 3>these Broccoli sprouts?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2752
02:02:15.790 --> 02:02:18.320
<v Speaker 3>maybe an exhaustion as ketone drink as </v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2753
02:02:18.380 --> 02:02:20.280
<v Speaker 3>like the two of them together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2754
02:02:20.281 --> 02:02:21.114
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the only thing is like I mentioned </v>

2755
02:02:21.981 --> 02:02:22.814
<v Speaker 3>for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I crash after a couple of hours where </v>

2756
02:02:24.921 --> 02:02:27.890
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it's like really like,</v>

2757
02:02:27.920 --> 02:02:28.753
<v Speaker 3>like crashing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you could mitigate that with </v>

2758
02:02:30.471 --> 02:02:34.250
<v Speaker 3>maybe some sort of a glucose because one</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the things maybe so yeah,</v>

2759
02:02:34.251 --> 02:02:35.084
<v Speaker 3>they say to take when you're taking </v>
<v Speaker 3>those ketone salts or ketone esters are </v>

2760
02:02:38.931 --> 02:02:39.764
<v Speaker 3>really potent ones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is to take them with glucose and they </v>

2761
02:02:42.501 --> 02:02:43.334
<v Speaker 3>actually say on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they say in the instructions to take it </v>

2762
02:02:45.141 --> 02:02:46.340
<v Speaker 3>with a high carbohydrate meal.</v>

2763
02:02:46.930 --> 02:02:47.763
<v Speaker 3>And so I usually will take,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll usually eat a bowl of oatmeal with </v>

2764
02:02:50.210 --> 02:02:53.120
<v Speaker 3>some fruit and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'll take it.</v>

2765
02:02:53.121 --> 02:02:53.954
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but still it really like it lowers my </v>

2766
02:02:56.301 --> 02:02:57.134
<v Speaker 3>blood,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my blood glucose levels dramatically </v>

2767
02:02:58.491 --> 02:03:00.520
<v Speaker 3>within an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like that's interesting.</v>

2768
02:03:00.540 --> 02:03:05.060
<v Speaker 3>I'm serious when I've taken those </v>
<v Speaker 3>supplements,</v>

2769
02:03:05.061 --> 02:03:06.770
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't feel the crash.</v>

2770
02:03:07.160 --> 02:03:09.650
<v Speaker 3>Try Try that when I'm talking to him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Man,</v>

2771
02:03:09.830 --> 02:03:14.570
<v Speaker 3>it's a really powerful HP.</v>
<v Speaker 3>HIV and HIV and M,</v>

2772
02:03:15.900 --> 02:03:16.733
<v Speaker 3>I should've brought you some.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have some in the hotel thinking about </v>

2773
02:03:20.061 --> 02:03:21.290
<v Speaker 3>trying and taking it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I was like,</v>

2774
02:03:21.310 --> 02:03:22.640
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does it taste like ass?</v>

2775
02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:24.110
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it tastes really bad.</v>

2776
02:03:24.111 --> 02:03:26.270
<v Speaker 3>I mean like definitely say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2777
02:03:26.600 --> 02:03:28.850
<v Speaker 3>so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some of them are so disgusting.</v>

2778
02:03:29.440 --> 02:03:33.380
<v Speaker 3>I did an interview with the president of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Buck Institute for Research on aging</v>

2779
02:03:33.740 --> 02:03:34.573
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like downed it right before he walked </v>

2780
02:03:36.861 --> 02:03:38.270
<v Speaker 3>in and I was like.</v>

2781
02:03:38.330 --> 02:03:39.163
<v Speaker 3>And he had just published a study on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on ketosis and animals and helping with </v>

2782
02:03:43.551 --> 02:03:46.430
<v Speaker 3>lifespan and brain aging and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But.</v>

2783
02:03:46.431 --> 02:03:47.690
<v Speaker 3>So I had to tell him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2784
02:03:48.290 --> 02:03:50.930
<v Speaker 3>like here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just took this and I actually gave him</v>

2785
02:03:50.931 --> 02:03:52.490
<v Speaker 3>some as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>

2786
02:03:52.760 --> 02:03:55.360
<v Speaker 3>because it was kind of embarrassing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

2787
02:03:55.380 --> 02:03:56.213
<v Speaker 3>I was grimacing big time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like a funny way to first meet </v>

2788
02:03:59.841 --> 02:04:00.674
<v Speaker 3>someone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know I had just eaten some pineapple </v>

2789
02:04:02.211 --> 02:04:03.044
<v Speaker 3>because they had like some fruit </v>
<v Speaker 3>available and they didn't have any </v>

2790
02:04:04.341 --> 02:04:05.870
<v Speaker 3>carbohydrate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What am I going to.</v>

2791
02:04:06.200 --> 02:04:08.450
<v Speaker 3>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now you know all my secrets.</v>

2792
02:04:09.070 --> 02:04:11.180
<v Speaker 3>Well that's a good one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's fascinating.</v>

2793
02:04:11.181 --> 02:04:12.014
<v Speaker 3>I've never thought about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that seems like a pre podcast meal </v>

2794
02:04:14.151 --> 02:04:17.210
<v Speaker 3>or pre comedy show meal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That might be like a really good idea to</v>

2795
02:04:17.211 --> 02:04:20.180
<v Speaker 3>try just a big plate of Broccoli </v>
<v Speaker 3>sprouts,</v>

2796
02:04:20.840 --> 02:04:24.200
<v Speaker 3>Broccoli sprouts with a really good </v>
<v Speaker 3>source on the supplements are not.</v>

2797
02:04:24.200 --> 02:04:26.330
<v Speaker 3>So it's really sulforaphane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not very stable.</v>

2798
02:04:26.660 --> 02:04:29.900
<v Speaker 3>So you can check it into a shake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you grind it up?</v>

2799
02:04:30.260 --> 02:04:32.120
<v Speaker 3>So I haven't been doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

2800
02:04:32.420 --> 02:04:33.253
<v Speaker 3>I grind it up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you can just put them on a salad or </v>

2801
02:04:34.941 --> 02:04:35.774
<v Speaker 3>you can just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2802
02:04:35.840 --> 02:04:37.950
<v Speaker 3>you don't have to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't taste good.</v>

2803
02:04:38.050 --> 02:04:40.200
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like that's why you made a mistake.</v>

2804
02:04:40.470 --> 02:04:41.260
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

2805
02:04:41.260 --> 02:04:43.830
<v Speaker 3>so if you're going to put an n shake </v>
<v Speaker 3>with other other things,</v>

2806
02:04:43.831 --> 02:04:44.664
<v Speaker 3>you want to blend it up first because </v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm the enzyme myrosinase that has to </v>

2807
02:04:48.811 --> 02:04:50.830
<v Speaker 3>come in contact with the precursor of </v>
<v Speaker 3>sulforaphane.</v>

2808
02:04:50.880 --> 02:04:53.160
<v Speaker 3>Glucoraphanin has to be in contact with </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

2809
02:04:53.161 --> 02:04:55.500
<v Speaker 3>So it's diluted out if you have like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>big all this other stuff.</v>

2810
02:04:56.040 --> 02:04:58.800
<v Speaker 3>So blended up first and then add your </v>
<v Speaker 3>other stuff.</v>

2811
02:04:59.970 --> 02:05:00.803
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been taking a supplement I got </v>

2812
02:05:02.731 --> 02:05:04.430
<v Speaker 3>from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from France called prostitution,</v>

2813
02:05:04.560 --> 02:05:05.393
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's published studies on it and it </v>

2814
02:05:06.420 --> 02:05:08.010
<v Speaker 3>tastes like Broccoli sprouts.</v>

2815
02:05:08.430 --> 02:05:10.350
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

2816
02:05:10.440 --> 02:05:11.273
<v Speaker 3>I've been taking that right now just </v>
<v Speaker 3>because of the potential risk for </v>

2817
02:05:14.551 --> 02:05:17.730
<v Speaker 3>contamination.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just breastfeeding and you know,</v>

2818
02:05:17.731 --> 02:05:19.990
<v Speaker 3>I'm just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm always going to.</v>

2819
02:05:20.990 --> 02:05:21.823
<v Speaker 3>So I'm just Kinda [inaudible] that </v>
<v Speaker 3>bacteria has been shown to be </v>

2820
02:05:23.311 --> 02:05:25.870
<v Speaker 3>transferred from breast milk and juice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was like that,</v>

2821
02:05:25.950 --> 02:05:26.783
<v Speaker 3>that news story where the woman ate the </v>
<v Speaker 3>placenta and like it was like I was </v>

2822
02:05:30.391 --> 02:05:31.224
<v Speaker 3>reading this instagram who's a Vegan and</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was going on and on about people </v>

2823
02:05:34.651 --> 02:05:36.210
<v Speaker 3>getting ECO law for meat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2824
02:05:36.211 --> 02:05:37.260
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

2825
02:05:37.410 --> 02:05:40.410
<v Speaker 3>you get it from fucking spinach,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Broccoli.</v>

2826
02:05:40.411 --> 02:05:43.230
<v Speaker 3>You get it from farm raised vegetables </v>
<v Speaker 3>like stop.</v>

2827
02:05:43.520 --> 02:05:44.500
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

2828
02:05:44.530 --> 02:05:45.363
<v Speaker 3>but it comes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's writing in a way because it comes </v>

2829
02:05:47.491 --> 02:05:50.670
<v Speaker 3>from the runoff from a animal feces.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2830
02:05:50.671 --> 02:05:52.950
<v Speaker 3>And that's how it gets into.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that the case?</v>

2831
02:05:52.951 --> 02:05:54.210
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty sure.</v>

2832
02:05:54.960 --> 02:05:57.470
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty sure that's how it gets into </v>
<v Speaker 3>the food out,</v>

2833
02:05:57.480 --> 02:05:58.313
<v Speaker 3>if that's true.</v>

2834
02:05:58.720 --> 02:06:03.720
<v Speaker 3>I'm eco lie in vegetables comes from </v>
<v Speaker 3>animal agriculture.</v>

2835
02:06:06.390 --> 02:06:08.460
<v Speaker 3>Google that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's true.</v>

2836
02:06:10.380 --> 02:06:15.120
<v Speaker 3>I've certainly had some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a bad sprouts before store bought.</v>

2837
02:06:15.780 --> 02:06:17.210
<v Speaker 3>I was sailing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got sick,</v>

2838
02:06:17.370 --> 02:06:18.480
<v Speaker 3>I got sick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2839
02:06:18.910 --> 02:06:21.170
<v Speaker 3>and also I'm from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once we made it home,</v>

2840
02:06:21.260 --> 02:06:22.460
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just,</v>

2841
02:06:22.530 --> 02:06:25.210
<v Speaker 3>if you have to be really careful if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>have too much water around,</v>

2842
02:06:25.220 --> 02:06:26.053
<v Speaker 3>if it's too much heat and condensation </v>
<v Speaker 3>and all that stuff to it grows because </v>

2843
02:06:29.251 --> 02:06:30.660
<v Speaker 3>you're eating it raw.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2844
02:06:30.661 --> 02:06:31.950
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when you clean it,</v>

2845
02:06:31.951 --> 02:06:36.780
<v Speaker 3>I mean how difficult is it to clean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you find anything from manure?</v>

2846
02:06:36.840 --> 02:06:37.730
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cool.</v>

2847
02:06:37.800 --> 02:06:39.590
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it is right?</v>

2848
02:06:39.700 --> 02:06:41.640
<v Speaker 3>Romance and general catalyst in </v>
<v Speaker 3>particular.</v>

2849
02:06:41.641 --> 02:06:43.070
<v Speaker 3>Both beef and dairy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>

2850
02:06:44.490 --> 02:06:45.810
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So a lot of these,</v>

2851
02:06:45.811 --> 02:06:48.540
<v Speaker 3>especially like a real organic farm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of times they're,</v>

2852
02:06:48.800 --> 02:06:52.230
<v Speaker 3>they're very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have animals,</v>

2853
02:06:52.380 --> 02:06:53.213
<v Speaker 3>plants,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all sorts of other stuff together and </v>

2854
02:06:54.901 --> 02:06:56.700
<v Speaker 3>the runoff from the cows.</v>

2855
02:06:57.280 --> 02:06:58.950
<v Speaker 3>Good side of your Broccoli and all that </v>
<v Speaker 3>jazz.</v>

2856
02:06:59.260 --> 02:07:00.480
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's nasty.</v>

2857
02:07:00.780 --> 02:07:01.613
<v Speaker 3>And how do you clean that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean if I told you that Ecolab was on </v>

2858
02:07:05.671 --> 02:07:07.860
<v Speaker 3>your vegetables,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you still want to eat them.</v>

2859
02:07:07.861 --> 02:07:10.350
<v Speaker 3>If you clean them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd be eating that shit.</v>

2860
02:07:10.530 --> 02:07:13.680
<v Speaker 3>So how do you clean your vegetables?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I rinsed them.</v>

2861
02:07:13.681 --> 02:07:14.940
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I mean,</v>

2862
02:07:15.290 --> 02:07:17.910
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But how good usually don't get,</v>

2863
02:07:17.940 --> 02:07:20.460
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you knew,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that's the thing,</v>

2864
02:07:20.461 --> 02:07:22.170
<v Speaker 3>like when people say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2865
02:07:22.171 --> 02:07:23.610
<v Speaker 3>you should clean your vegetables,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I will.</v>

2866
02:07:23.611 --> 02:07:24.444
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if there was eco lie on those </v>

2867
02:07:25.681 --> 02:07:28.050
<v Speaker 3>vegetables and you cleaned them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we just think there'll be enough.</v>

2868
02:07:28.410 --> 02:07:32.450
<v Speaker 3>Probably wouldn't wash your Greens won't</v>
<v Speaker 3>protect against Ecolab consumed.</v>

2869
02:07:32.460 --> 02:07:34.110
<v Speaker 3>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The heat kills.</v>

2870
02:07:34.111 --> 02:07:36.730
<v Speaker 3>E coli and other types of bacteria can </v>
<v Speaker 3>make you sick.</v>

2871
02:07:36.760 --> 02:07:39.310
<v Speaker 3>Even Greens that are typically consume </v>
<v Speaker 3>raw such as Romaine.</v>

2872
02:07:39.311 --> 02:07:41.010
<v Speaker 3>Lettuce can be cooked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

2873
02:07:41.110 --> 02:07:43.810
<v Speaker 3>so equalized.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Destroyed at one 60 degrees Fahrenheit,</v>

2874
02:07:43.811 --> 02:07:46.030
<v Speaker 3>which is seems like everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Trick analysis.</v>

2875
02:07:46.420 --> 02:07:48.280
<v Speaker 3>A lot of things killed at one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One 60.</v>

2876
02:07:48.960 --> 02:07:52.600
<v Speaker 3>So I'm so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the Broccoli sprouts,</v>

2877
02:07:52.601 --> 02:07:54.670
<v Speaker 3>you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't consume cooked?</v>

2878
02:07:55.190 --> 02:07:56.023
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because the enzyme that converts the </v>

2879
02:07:58.651 --> 02:08:02.030
<v Speaker 2>precursor into active Sulforaphane is </v>
<v Speaker 2>heat sensitive.</v>

2880
02:08:02.430 --> 02:08:03.450
<v Speaker 3>Is it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2881
02:08:03.610 --> 02:08:04.443
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>does it diminish it significantly or </v>

2882
02:08:05.851 --> 02:08:06.750
<v Speaker 3>kill it altogether?</v>

2883
02:08:07.080 --> 02:08:08.070
<v Speaker 2>Significantly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2884
02:08:08.071 --> 02:08:08.904
<v Speaker 2>you still,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's still some plus the precursor </v>

2885
02:08:10.891 --> 02:08:12.130
<v Speaker 2>that your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2886
02:08:12.180 --> 02:08:14.710
<v Speaker 2>that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is important for forming silver fain.</v>

2887
02:08:15.120 --> 02:08:17.730
<v Speaker 2>You actually have bacteria in your gut.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is,</v>

2888
02:08:17.731 --> 02:08:18.564
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something that Dr Jed Fay he talked </v>

2889
02:08:19.471 --> 02:08:20.304
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2890
02:08:20.400 --> 02:08:21.930
<v Speaker 2>when I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I interviewed him,</v>

2891
02:08:22.190 --> 02:08:23.023
<v Speaker 2>he was talking about there's certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>strains of bacteria in the gut that </v>

2892
02:08:25.231 --> 02:08:26.064
<v Speaker 2>convert because they have the enzyme </v>
<v Speaker 2>myrosinase and they convert it into </v>

2893
02:08:28.550 --> 02:08:32.250
<v Speaker 2>silver or feeding the gut so you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually get a certain amount.</v>

2894
02:08:32.280 --> 02:08:34.270
<v Speaker 2>He also mentioned that you can take,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2895
02:08:34.830 --> 02:08:39.270
<v Speaker 2>mustard seed powder and sprinkle it on </v>
<v Speaker 2>top of your cooked Brussels sprouts,</v>

2896
02:08:39.300 --> 02:08:40.920
<v Speaker 2>your sauteed Kale,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

2897
02:08:40.980 --> 02:08:43.140
<v Speaker 2>this is what I do because I eat sauteed </v>
<v Speaker 2>Kale.</v>

2898
02:08:43.141 --> 02:08:45.030
<v Speaker 2>And so I also have raw.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You eat raw kale,</v>

2899
02:08:46.410 --> 02:08:49.710
<v Speaker 2>mustard powder has the active enzyme so </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can consume that.</v>

2900
02:08:49.980 --> 02:08:51.790
<v Speaker 2>I'm with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2901
02:08:52.230 --> 02:08:54.040
<v Speaker 2>that's the other thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I mentioned the,</v>

2902
02:08:54.180 --> 02:08:56.070
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are the supplements I'm taking.</v>

2903
02:08:56.071 --> 02:08:56.904
<v Speaker 2>There is one out there also that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has a lot of the precursor and some of </v>

2904
02:09:00.301 --> 02:09:02.790
<v Speaker 2>the enzyme.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you can get a modest amount of.</v>

2905
02:09:02.791 --> 02:09:05.580
<v Speaker 2>And this is what was used in the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>recent autism study.</v>

2906
02:09:05.840 --> 02:09:07.170
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's called Avma call,</v>

2907
02:09:07.740 --> 02:09:08.420
<v Speaker 2>but the one right spoken</v>

2908
02:09:08.420 --> 02:09:11.520
<v Speaker 3>like aV ,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a n wait,</v>

2909
02:09:12.190 --> 02:09:15.450
<v Speaker 3>avi.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Avi m a v a m.</v>

2910
02:09:15.600 --> 02:09:20.600
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Av know ab and c o l e V m a c o l e V,</v>

2911
02:09:26.430 --> 02:09:28.710
<v Speaker 3>that one's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that one's probably one of the best ones</v>

2912
02:09:28.711 --> 02:09:30.000
<v Speaker 3>in the US,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but prostate,</v>

2913
02:09:31.230 --> 02:09:35.460
<v Speaker 3>prostate feigns naturally produce fewer </v>
<v Speaker 3>frame.</v>

2914
02:09:36.710 --> 02:09:38.580
<v Speaker 3>Dr Jed fetty has,</v>
<v Speaker 3>has test this,</v>

2915
02:09:38.650 --> 02:09:39.483
<v Speaker 3>these teas test these different soul </v>
<v Speaker 3>supplements and looked at Sulforaphane </v>

2916
02:09:43.051 --> 02:09:45.980
<v Speaker 3>metabolites in urine to look at like </v>
<v Speaker 3>bioavailability.</v>

2917
02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:48.740
<v Speaker 3>And what is the one that you like?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're prostituting.</v>

2918
02:09:48.750 --> 02:09:51.150
<v Speaker 3>I like apropos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've taken both,</v>

2919
02:09:51.570 --> 02:09:54.660
<v Speaker 3>but it's hard to get in the US.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why is it hard?</v>

2920
02:09:55.200 --> 02:09:56.790
<v Speaker 3>Because it's made.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's in France.</v>

2921
02:09:56.791 --> 02:09:58.610
<v Speaker 3>It's a France.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can we get this on Amazon?</v>

2922
02:09:59.430 --> 02:10:00.330
<v Speaker 3>Know what?</v>

2923
02:10:02.970 --> 02:10:06.690
<v Speaker 3>Amazon's got me hooked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now that you can get it,</v>

2924
02:10:07.160 --> 02:10:10.560
<v Speaker 3>it's just find it somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A legal website maybe.</v>

2925
02:10:10.790 --> 02:10:11.623
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's what I've been taking </v>

2926
02:10:15.001 --> 02:10:16.440
<v Speaker 3>recently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How much did you take?</v>

2927
02:10:16.900 --> 02:10:20.400
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm taking three pills a day.</v>

2928
02:10:20.700 --> 02:10:23.340
<v Speaker 3>I think each pill has 10 milligrams with</v>
<v Speaker 3>food.</v>

2929
02:10:23.730 --> 02:10:25.590
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>definitely.</v>

2930
02:10:25.600 --> 02:10:30.600
<v Speaker 3>With food for absorption or um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2931
02:10:30.751 --> 02:10:34.910
<v Speaker 3>it seems like it can be a little like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2932
02:10:35.060 --> 02:10:37.880
<v Speaker 3>it seems it just sometimes if you're on </v>
<v Speaker 3>an empty stomach,</v>

2933
02:10:38.780 --> 02:10:39.690
<v Speaker 3>doesn't feel good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2934
02:10:41.150 --> 02:10:43.450
<v Speaker 3>I've had a lot of people email me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2935
02:10:43.700 --> 02:10:45.350
<v Speaker 3>since the first time you and I talked </v>
<v Speaker 3>about,</v>

2936
02:10:45.351 --> 02:10:47.610
<v Speaker 3>so for vein,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of them have taken album call,</v>

2937
02:10:47.611 --> 02:10:50.030
<v Speaker 3>some have gotten a hold of phosphate and</v>
<v Speaker 3>some Broccoli sprouts.</v>

2938
02:10:50.390 --> 02:10:52.450
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've had people talking about like tumor</v>

2939
02:10:52.451 --> 02:10:54.320
<v Speaker 3>shrinking and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like one guy.</v>

2940
02:10:54.321 --> 02:10:56.630
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's all anecdotal,</v>

2941
02:10:57.050 --> 02:10:58.200
<v Speaker 3>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>

2942
02:10:58.260 --> 02:10:59.093
<v Speaker 3>I've had multiple,</v>
<v Speaker 3>multiple people talking about their </v>

2943
02:11:00.561 --> 02:11:03.530
<v Speaker 3>prostates stimulating antigen going </v>
<v Speaker 3>down.</v>

2944
02:11:03.560 --> 02:11:04.520
<v Speaker 3>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>prostate.</v>

2945
02:11:05.140 --> 02:11:07.970
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it stimulating PSA?</v>

2946
02:11:08.180 --> 02:11:10.910
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] my brain sort of dwindling </v>
<v Speaker 3>out,</v>

2947
02:11:10.911 --> 02:11:14.930
<v Speaker 3>but I'm not going down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know it's a real thing.</v>

2948
02:11:14.990 --> 02:11:16.400
<v Speaker 3>It really is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a real thing.</v>

2949
02:11:16.401 --> 02:11:17.234
<v Speaker 3>I mean I kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like I've done really good just </v>

2950
02:11:20.121 --> 02:11:23.060
<v Speaker 3>from like exercise and getting all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fish oil and stuff,</v>

2951
02:11:23.061 --> 02:11:26.240
<v Speaker 3>but it's definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's constantly,</v>

2952
02:11:26.241 --> 02:11:27.790
<v Speaker 3>it's just all you're giving them </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>

2953
02:11:29.110 --> 02:11:31.540
<v Speaker 3>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It,</v>

2954
02:11:31.630 --> 02:11:36.630
<v Speaker 3>it's the people that we were talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about this before the podcast with Dan,</v>

2955
02:11:38.600 --> 02:11:42.230
<v Speaker 3>people that don't think that it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>difficult to be a,</v>

2956
02:11:42.320 --> 02:11:44.870
<v Speaker 3>just a mom or a stay at home mom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're crazy.</v>

2957
02:11:45.290 --> 02:11:47.630
<v Speaker 3>I was so judgmental and I really feel </v>
<v Speaker 3>bad.</v>

2958
02:11:47.900 --> 02:11:51.080
<v Speaker 3>I really do because it's the hardest </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

2959
02:11:51.220 --> 02:11:52.250
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>

2960
02:11:52.251 --> 02:11:54.100
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've ever done a great job.</v>

2961
02:11:54.110 --> 02:11:55.290
<v Speaker 3>You want to do a good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh really?</v>

2962
02:11:55.420 --> 02:11:56.241
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the hardest thing.</v>

2963
02:11:56.241 --> 02:11:56.841
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

2964
02:11:56.841 --> 02:11:58.310
<v Speaker 3>job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could do with your pajamas on.</v>

2965
02:11:58.311 --> 02:11:59.150
<v Speaker 3>It's not the hardest thing.</v>

2966
02:12:01.850 --> 02:12:04.280
<v Speaker 3>I really liked these.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hilarious.</v>

2967
02:12:04.281 --> 02:12:05.180
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's hilarious.</v>

2968
02:12:05.210 --> 02:12:06.043
<v Speaker 3>He's a great guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean if you want to do a good job and </v>

2969
02:12:07.341 --> 02:12:10.630
<v Speaker 3>you're thinking about like the enriched </v>
<v Speaker 3>environment and how important it is.</v>

2970
02:12:10.680 --> 02:12:11.513
<v Speaker 3>I gotta do I gotta read to them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got to know all this and then all the </v>

2971
02:12:14.541 --> 02:12:16.420
<v Speaker 3>nutrition and knocking the plastic and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the.</v>

2972
02:12:16.610 --> 02:12:18.770
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's just a lot of work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2973
02:12:18.800 --> 02:12:20.840
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>screamed you don't want to have like you</v>

2974
02:12:20.841 --> 02:12:21.674
<v Speaker 3>didn't want to sit them in front of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>television and having them watching </v>

2975
02:12:23.061 --> 02:12:24.710
<v Speaker 3>cartoons,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2976
02:12:24.711 --> 02:12:27.150
<v Speaker 3>so which definitely would be easy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2977
02:12:28.220 --> 02:12:29.053
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and maybe the more kids you have your </v>

2978
02:12:30.260 --> 02:12:33.140
<v Speaker 3>kind of like something that I can't but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>

2979
02:12:33.141 --> 02:12:36.200
<v Speaker 3>it's definitely a very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very hard.</v>

2980
02:12:36.230 --> 02:12:39.170
<v Speaker 3>It's a hard job but very rewarding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So rewarding.</v>

2981
02:12:39.200 --> 02:12:41.780
<v Speaker 3>Like I just can't even believe I ever </v>
<v Speaker 3>had a life before.</v>

2982
02:12:41.780 --> 02:12:43.480
<v Speaker 3>My son,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2983
02:12:43.930 --> 02:12:45.020
<v Speaker 3>I'm just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my life is like,</v>

2984
02:12:45.560 --> 02:12:47.810
<v Speaker 3>I get so much joy from him now and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>just like,</v>

2985
02:12:47.840 --> 02:12:49.700
<v Speaker 3>how do I get all this toy before?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2986
02:12:49.810 --> 02:12:50.530
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's Christmas.</v>

2987
02:12:50.530 --> 02:12:53.070
<v Speaker 3>I remember before you had them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you were like,</v>

2988
02:12:53.120 --> 02:12:54.470
<v Speaker 3>concerned like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>boy,</v>

2989
02:12:54.471 --> 02:12:55.304
<v Speaker 3>I wonder where my time's going to go </v>
<v Speaker 3>from still going to be able to do </v>

2990
02:12:57.441 --> 02:12:58.640
<v Speaker 3>research.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2991
02:12:59.200 --> 02:13:01.030
<v Speaker 3>whooo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2992
02:13:01.040 --> 02:13:01.873
<v Speaker 3>it's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I thankfully I have my mother who </v>

2993
02:13:03.531 --> 02:13:06.290
<v Speaker 3>helps out a lot and that gives me some </v>
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>

2994
02:13:06.650 --> 02:13:08.960
<v Speaker 3>but I'm like essentially doing both.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

2995
02:13:09.230 --> 02:13:11.480
<v Speaker 3>Do you feel the switches going off in </v>
<v Speaker 3>your brain,</v>

2996
02:13:11.610 --> 02:13:14.780
<v Speaker 3>your brain switches over because you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>essentially.</v>

2997
02:13:14.781 --> 02:13:17.220
<v Speaker 3>There's some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a biological mechanism that's happening.</v>

2998
02:13:17.230 --> 02:13:18.063
<v Speaker 3>It must be fascinating to study on </v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself as you're watching it happen </v>

2999
02:13:21.410 --> 02:13:22.161
<v Speaker 3>because you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3000
02:13:22.161 --> 02:13:24.500
<v Speaker 3>the oxytocin gets jacked through the </v>
<v Speaker 3>roof.</v>

3001
02:13:24.770 --> 02:13:29.030
<v Speaker 3>You have this little thing that you love</v>
<v Speaker 3>literally more than anything you've ever</v>

3002
02:13:29.031 --> 02:13:31.980
<v Speaker 3>experienced in your entire existence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't believe how much you</v>

3003
02:13:31.980 --> 02:13:35.070
<v Speaker 1>love them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to imagine like I,</v>

3004
02:13:35.220 --> 02:13:36.053
<v Speaker 1>it's hard for me as a father to imagine </v>
<v Speaker 1>what it would be like to be a mother </v>

3005
02:13:40.170 --> 02:13:43.510
<v Speaker 1>because I think there's a big difference</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I think there's,</v>

3006
02:13:43.511 --> 02:13:46.080
<v Speaker 1>and this is one of the reasons why me </v>
<v Speaker 1>and my wife had a deal.</v>

3007
02:13:46.081 --> 02:13:48.930
<v Speaker 1>I didn't name any of the kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just had veto power.</v>

3008
02:13:49.470 --> 02:13:52.860
<v Speaker 1>It's like you can't call the kid like </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking turnip or some stupid shit.</v>

3009
02:13:53.190 --> 02:13:55.310
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I mean,</v>

3010
02:13:55.320 --> 02:13:58.740
<v Speaker 1>it's just nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody but you.</v>

3011
02:13:58.860 --> 02:14:01.020
<v Speaker 1>It's in your body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you're cooking.</v>

3012
02:14:01.021 --> 02:14:03.480
<v Speaker 1>It impacts you that I know inside of </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

3013
02:14:03.510 --> 02:14:08.510
<v Speaker 1>The difference in the job a man does and</v>
<v Speaker 1>a woman does in terms of like the actual</v>

3014
02:14:10.530 --> 02:14:14.580
<v Speaker 1>making of the baby could not be further </v>
<v Speaker 1>apart from each other.</v>

3015
02:14:14.700 --> 02:14:18.270
<v Speaker 1>The guy just does something that feels </v>
<v Speaker 1>great and it's done,</v>

3016
02:14:18.630 --> 02:14:23.550
<v Speaker 1>and then the woman goes through this </v>
<v Speaker 1>insane hormonal process.</v>

3017
02:14:23.790 --> 02:14:26.580
<v Speaker 1>Her body morphs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She gains 50,</v>

3018
02:14:26.581 --> 02:14:30.030
<v Speaker 1>60 plus pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Her body stretches out.</v>

3019
02:14:30.120 --> 02:14:32.220
<v Speaker 1>She's got a baby inside of her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kicking her.</v>

3020
02:14:32.221 --> 02:14:34.110
<v Speaker 1>She's uncomfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She can't move.</v>

3021
02:14:34.111 --> 02:14:34.944
<v Speaker 1>She's swelling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then she has to go through excruciating </v>

3022
02:14:37.051 --> 02:14:39.990
<v Speaker 1>pain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a video on dig from yesterday,</v>

3023
02:14:40.620 --> 02:14:43.740
<v Speaker 1>see if you can find it where they have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>labor.</v>

3024
02:14:43.800 --> 02:14:44.633
<v Speaker 1>I'm recreating like pain device that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they put men under and they have these </v>

3025
02:14:51.301 --> 02:14:56.301
<v Speaker 1>fucking macho men that they have this </v>
<v Speaker 1>machine that they do something,</v>

3026
02:14:56.761 --> 02:14:59.970
<v Speaker 1>they have these a sense these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll put it up,</v>

3027
02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:01.830
<v Speaker 1>we'll figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How the fuck they did it,</v>

3028
02:15:02.070 --> 02:15:02.903
<v Speaker 1>but it somehow or another reenacts the </v>
<v Speaker 1>pain of labor and let's a man </v>

3029
02:15:07.681 --> 02:15:09.470
<v Speaker 1>experienced what it's like get your </v>
<v Speaker 1>vagina</v>

3030
02:15:09.520 --> 02:15:11.240
<v Speaker 3>blown apart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>

3031
02:15:11.310 --> 02:15:12.143
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is.</v>

3032
02:15:12.240 --> 02:15:15.770
<v Speaker 3>You just totally explained.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the whole pregnancy and then like</v>

3033
02:15:15.920 --> 02:15:16.753
<v Speaker 3>the delivery and moves just like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then it's like a part of you is </v>

3034
02:15:21.591 --> 02:15:23.840
<v Speaker 3>walking around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whereas for the man,</v>

3035
02:15:23.841 --> 02:15:24.674
<v Speaker 3>it's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3036
02:15:24.680 --> 02:15:26.480
<v Speaker 3>that's my kid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

3037
02:15:26.481 --> 02:15:27.314
<v Speaker 3>And you get all this oxytocin rush,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't even think it's a fraction </v>

3038
02:15:29.450 --> 02:15:30.800
<v Speaker 3>of breastfeeding,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3039
02:15:30.920 --> 02:15:33.200
<v Speaker 3>that whole like nursing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's like huge.</v>

3040
02:15:33.201 --> 02:15:34.034
<v Speaker 3>Oxytocin lays huge here and then of </v>
<v Speaker 3>course there's the no sleep for like </v>

3041
02:15:38.650 --> 02:15:39.441
<v Speaker 3>months.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And for me,</v>

3042
02:15:39.441 --> 02:15:40.670
<v Speaker 3>like I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3043
02:15:41.600 --> 02:15:44.180
<v Speaker 3>my son,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like he's seen a bottle like,</v>

3044
02:15:44.270 --> 02:15:46.310
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>six or seven times.</v>

3045
02:15:46.311 --> 02:15:50.900
<v Speaker 3>Like I just always been the pool pump.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3046
02:15:50.920 --> 02:15:52.490
<v Speaker 3>so because I was always there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

3047
02:15:52.550 --> 02:15:55.670
<v Speaker 3>I've only had a pump a few times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The thing about pumping that seems to be</v>

3048
02:15:55.671 --> 02:15:58.430
<v Speaker 3>really good though is that the kids can </v>
<v Speaker 3>get more of it.</v>

3049
02:15:59.030 --> 02:16:00.700
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>depending on how,</v>

3050
02:16:00.710 --> 02:16:01.543
<v Speaker 3>wherever it had an issue was actually an</v>
<v Speaker 3>over producer and I had an issue of too </v>

3051
02:16:05.511 --> 02:16:06.500
<v Speaker 3>much where,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3052
02:16:06.501 --> 02:16:07.340
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>

3053
02:16:07.450 --> 02:16:08.540
<v Speaker 3>oh mom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3054
02:16:08.541 --> 02:16:13.250
<v Speaker 3>So I was looking for that and I stumbled</v>
<v Speaker 3>across this syndrome.</v>

3055
02:16:14.160 --> 02:16:14.993
<v Speaker 3>Sympathetic pregnancy is a proposed </v>
<v Speaker 3>condition which a partner experience </v>

3056
02:16:17.071 --> 02:16:20.000
<v Speaker 3>with some symptoms and that's just a </v>
<v Speaker 3>bitch ass man.</v>

3057
02:16:21.050 --> 02:16:24.830
<v Speaker 3>These include minor weight gain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>altered hormone levels,</v>

3058
02:16:24.860 --> 02:16:27.080
<v Speaker 3>morning nausea and disturbed sleep </v>
<v Speaker 3>patterns.</v>

3059
02:16:27.081 --> 02:16:29.040
<v Speaker 3>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's just a bitch ass man.</v>

3060
02:16:29.090 --> 02:16:30.190
<v Speaker 3>Disturb sleep patterns</v>

3061
02:16:30.190 --> 02:16:34.450
<v Speaker 1>come after the baby's born.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me tell you that silly mag,</v>

3062
02:16:34.480 --> 02:16:35.560
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know what you're talking about.</v>

3063
02:16:35.561 --> 02:16:37.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some guys say that over again.</v>

3064
02:16:37.210 --> 02:16:38.021
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're too,</v>

3065
02:16:38.021 --> 02:16:39.970
<v Speaker 1>and I was pregnant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's because you're a lazy.</v>

3066
02:16:40.630 --> 02:16:42.370
<v Speaker 1>That excuse you lazy and he ate more </v>
<v Speaker 1>food.</v>

3067
02:16:42.371 --> 02:16:45.040
<v Speaker 1>You fucking Slob.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That has nothing to do with a baby being</v>

3068
02:16:45.041 --> 02:16:46.900
<v Speaker 1>in your body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shut your mouth.</v>

3069
02:16:47.320 --> 02:16:48.700
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's embarrassing.</v>

3078
02:17:04.480 --> 02:17:05.740
<v Speaker 1>Labor pain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Simulated here.</v>

3079
02:17:05.741 --> 02:17:07.510
<v Speaker 1>Here it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at these guys.</v>

3082
02:17:22.021 --> 02:17:22.520
<v Speaker 5>activity</v>

3083
02:17:22.520 --> 02:17:24.490
<v Speaker 1>stage of labor where it's really getting</v>
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

3084
02:17:24.510 --> 02:17:27.770
<v Speaker 1>This is the beginning ramps up.</v>

3085
02:17:31.940 --> 02:17:34.830
<v Speaker 5>Starting to come down on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You guys are doing.</v>

02:17:40.820 --> 02:17:41.720
<v Speaker 5>I mean it really does.</v>

3087
02:17:42.640 --> 02:17:45.120
<v Speaker 1>What's next is these gals put a strap on</v>
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>

3088
02:17:45.130 --> 02:17:45.963
<v Speaker 1>They pegged these dudes next.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just have sensors on their stomach it </v>

3089
02:17:49.061 --> 02:17:49.894
<v Speaker 1>looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

3090
02:17:50.120 --> 02:17:51.540
<v Speaker 1>It's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3091
02:17:51.550 --> 02:17:52.383
<v Speaker 1>one of them like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know there's electromuscular </v>

3092
02:17:54.281 --> 02:17:57.460
<v Speaker 1>stimulation devices and they just jack </v>
<v Speaker 1>them through the roof.</v>

3093
02:17:58.180 --> 02:18:02.050
<v Speaker 1>That could have put one in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3094
02:18:02.051 --> 02:18:05.290
<v Speaker 1>Well they put them in their abdomen just</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting torn apart,</v>

3095
02:18:06.630 --> 02:18:08.560
<v Speaker 1>but it's not even as sensitive as your </v>
<v Speaker 1>vagina.</v>

3096
02:18:08.561 --> 02:18:09.394
<v Speaker 1>So it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Plus you're probably not making like </v>

3097
02:18:12.600 --> 02:18:13.900
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3098
02:18:13.910 --> 02:18:14.743
<v Speaker 1>it's nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's getting up on his hands and </v>

3099
02:18:15.471 --> 02:18:16.370
<v Speaker 1>knees like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come on,</v>

3100
02:18:16.760 --> 02:18:18.810
<v Speaker 1>stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3101
02:18:18.920 --> 02:18:19.753
<v Speaker 1>They just basically torturing these men </v>
<v Speaker 1>to make them feel bad for not being a </v>

3102
02:18:23.541 --> 02:18:24.374
<v Speaker 1>woman.</v>

3103
02:18:28.430 --> 02:18:32.630
<v Speaker 1>It's definitely a painful process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That whole delivery thing.</v>

3104
02:18:32.631 --> 02:18:34.970
<v Speaker 1>It's painful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it is pretty crazy.</v>

3105
02:18:35.150 --> 02:18:35.983
<v Speaker 1>It's definitely crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really crazy that people make </v>

3106
02:18:37.461 --> 02:18:39.980
<v Speaker 1>people in their bodies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

3107
02:18:39.981 --> 02:18:41.840
<v Speaker 1>Like I was talking to my daughter this </v>
<v Speaker 1>morning,</v>

3108
02:18:41.841 --> 02:18:45.740
<v Speaker 1>she was getting ready for school and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're sitting at the breakfast table and</v>

3109
02:18:45.741 --> 02:18:47.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm just looking at her and while she's </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking,</v>

3110
02:18:47.560 --> 02:18:52.560
<v Speaker 1>all I'm thinking of is you didn't use to</v>
<v Speaker 1>exist and now here you are talking to me</v>

3111
02:18:52.791 --> 02:18:53.624
<v Speaker 1>about school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk to me about this and that and all </v>

3112
02:18:56.001 --> 02:18:56.834
<v Speaker 1>the different things you're doing and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>is so odd that you are a combination of </v>

3113
02:19:02.331 --> 02:19:06.260
<v Speaker 1>my DNA and my wife's DNA and here you </v>
<v Speaker 1>are just sitting here eating breakfast,</v>

3114
02:19:06.560 --> 02:19:10.470
<v Speaker 1>just talking 10 years old now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah blah blah blah blah blah blah,</v>

3115
02:19:10.471 --> 02:19:10.790
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

3116
02:19:10.790 --> 02:19:14.480
<v Speaker 1>blah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then she tells jokes yet she's not that.</v>

3117
02:19:14.540 --> 02:19:15.080
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she'll,</v>

3118
02:19:15.080 --> 02:19:15.913
<v Speaker 1>she'll tell jokes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but my eight year old's fucking </v>

3119
02:19:17.601 --> 02:19:18.530
<v Speaker 1>hilarious.</v>

3120
02:19:18.830 --> 02:19:21.140
<v Speaker 1>The eight year old has figured out how </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be funny.</v>

3121
02:19:21.860 --> 02:19:24.890
<v Speaker 1>She farts on cue like she'll.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She'll tell you.</v>

3122
02:19:24.891 --> 02:19:26.240
<v Speaker 1>She's got to tell you something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Daddy,</v>

3123
02:19:26.241 --> 02:19:28.130
<v Speaker 1>I have to tell you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come here.</v>

3124
02:19:28.131 --> 02:19:31.940
<v Speaker 1>I tell you some fall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Follow the ground.</v>

3125
02:19:32.300 --> 02:19:35.060
<v Speaker 1>She thinks it's so funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She thinks she's.</v>

3126
02:19:35.150 --> 02:19:37.640
<v Speaker 1>She's really funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She says funny shit.</v>

3127
02:19:38.060 --> 02:19:38.893
<v Speaker 1>She's a very funny person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe she's got a little bit what some </v>

3128
02:19:41.421 --> 02:19:43.010
<v Speaker 1>of the DNA from you is a little more </v>
<v Speaker 1>active.</v>

3129
02:19:43.070 --> 02:19:47.140
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's like she knows how to get a</v>

3130
02:19:47.510 --> 02:19:49.640
<v Speaker 1>positive response out of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3131
02:19:49.790 --> 02:19:52.070
<v Speaker 1>she knows how to be silly and she loves </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

3132
02:19:52.190 --> 02:19:54.920
<v Speaker 1>She's really silly with her friends and </v>
<v Speaker 1>she's just like,</v>

3133
02:19:55.160 --> 02:19:57.740
<v Speaker 1>she's the comedian amongst her friends </v>
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

3134
02:19:57.741 --> 02:19:58.640
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3135
02:19:58.940 --> 02:20:00.620
<v Speaker 1>Whereas my 10 year old's not really that</v>
<v Speaker 1>funny,</v>

3136
02:20:01.370 --> 02:20:03.470
<v Speaker 1>but just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say she's not that funny.</v>

3137
02:20:03.471 --> 02:20:04.370
<v Speaker 1>She doesn't try.</v>

3138
02:20:04.550 --> 02:20:05.383
<v Speaker 1>It's not something she works at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also interesting how they're so </v>

3139
02:20:07.131 --> 02:20:11.060
<v Speaker 1>different and they're like the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>environment couldn't be more different.</v>

3140
02:20:11.390 --> 02:20:12.223
<v Speaker 1>Right out of the box.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They come out with their own little </v>

3141
02:20:13.281 --> 02:20:14.630
<v Speaker 1>personality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when they were tiny,</v>

3142
02:20:14.631 --> 02:20:16.700
<v Speaker 1>tiny babies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could see that there are different,</v>

3143
02:20:17.360 --> 02:20:18.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet if you had 10 of them,</v>

3144
02:20:18.771 --> 02:20:21.770
<v Speaker 1>like those crazy people that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>duggar's that have like 19 kids.</v>

3145
02:20:22.050 --> 02:20:23.690
<v Speaker 1>I bet they got 19 different humans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3146
02:20:23.720 --> 02:20:26.310
<v Speaker 1>but they're all totally different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3147
02:20:26.410 --> 02:20:28.340
<v Speaker 1>a bit one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like Mike's like shelly,</v>

3148
02:20:28.590 --> 02:20:30.150
<v Speaker 1>whether they're probably like kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>close.</v>

3149
02:20:31.670 --> 02:20:33.070
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's A.</v>

3150
02:20:33.440 --> 02:20:34.273
<v Speaker 1>I mean I wished that it made sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wish I could get a view of the human </v>

3151
02:20:41.330 --> 02:20:46.330
<v Speaker 1>organism from high enough above that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It all made sense and I and I could say,</v>

3152
02:20:47.210 --> 02:20:48.043
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these little varying pieces are </v>

3153
02:20:50.481 --> 02:20:55.481
<v Speaker 1>working in conjunction with each other </v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is why things get done and this</v>

3154
02:20:56.871 --> 02:21:00.500
<v Speaker 1>is why art gets created and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and buildings get built because you have</v>

3155
02:21:00.501 --> 02:21:01.334
<v Speaker 1>to have a this and then you have to have</v>
<v Speaker 1>that and they work together and you </v>

3156
02:21:04.881 --> 02:21:07.370
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's like personalities,</v>

3157
02:21:07.371 --> 02:21:09.620
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>In terms of relationships.</v>

3158
02:21:09.920 --> 02:21:12.560
<v Speaker 1>Like you don't want to have two bowls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3159
02:21:12.680 --> 02:21:13.513
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have one who's like this and the </v>

3160
02:21:14.991 --> 02:21:15.824
<v Speaker 1>other like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And together they make this one thing </v>

3161
02:21:16.941 --> 02:21:21.941
<v Speaker 1>that's really nice and we've both seen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure people that are just not,</v>

3162
02:21:22.900 --> 02:21:25.910
<v Speaker 1>they might be really great people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but together they're terrible.</v>

3163
02:21:26.380 --> 02:21:28.580
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just for whatever reason.</v>

3164
02:21:29.120 --> 02:21:30.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

3165
02:21:30.910 --> 02:21:32.870
<v Speaker 1>It's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

3166
02:21:33.660 --> 02:21:34.830
<v Speaker 2>sober October.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

3167
02:21:35.340 --> 02:21:36.173
<v Speaker 2>You're going to be doing some.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did I tell you about some of the new </v>

3168
02:21:37.840 --> 02:21:38.673
<v Speaker 2>stuff in the brain.</v>

3169
02:21:38.740 --> 02:21:39.573
<v Speaker 1>No new stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How new past year ask you before we get </v>

3170
02:21:43.961 --> 02:21:45.400
<v Speaker 1>going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there a difference?</v>

3171
02:21:45.401 --> 02:21:46.234
<v Speaker 1>But because I keep this keeps coming up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there any beneficial difference </v>

3172
02:21:48.821 --> 02:21:52.960
<v Speaker 1>between infrared versus standard?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3173
02:21:53.530 --> 02:21:54.363
<v Speaker 2>one of the studies that I referred to </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that had been published have been </v>

3174
02:21:57.431 --> 02:21:59.110
<v Speaker 2>using a standard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

3175
02:21:59.200 --> 02:22:00.240
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the,</v>

3176
02:22:00.280 --> 02:22:03.590
<v Speaker 2>they definitely work differently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the standard standard Hodson I,</v>

3177
02:22:03.600 --> 02:22:05.800
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're heating up the air and you're,</v>

3178
02:22:05.801 --> 02:22:06.200
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

3179
02:22:06.200 --> 02:22:07.630
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're getting hot.</v>

3180
02:22:07.990 --> 02:22:10.630
<v Speaker 2>Whereas the infrared is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like using,</v>

3181
02:22:10.631 --> 02:22:12.210
<v Speaker 2>it's like wavelengths that are like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3182
02:22:12.370 --> 02:22:13.203
<v Speaker 2>stimulating electrons that are sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>changing things and heating up you from </v>

3183
02:22:15.941 --> 02:22:17.770
<v Speaker 2>a different sort of way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>

3184
02:22:17.830 --> 02:22:21.160
<v Speaker 2>but I do think that the key is the heat </v>
<v Speaker 2>stress itself.</v>

3185
02:22:21.600 --> 02:22:23.730
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3186
02:22:23.780 --> 02:22:24.613
<v Speaker 2>the personally I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the standard is better because you </v>

3187
02:22:28.561 --> 02:22:30.450
<v Speaker 2>get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's easier to get more hot,</v>

3188
02:22:30.510 --> 02:22:31.920
<v Speaker 2>more discomfort,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more heat stress.</v>

3189
02:22:32.440 --> 02:22:34.590
<v Speaker 2>It takes a lot longer in an infrared </v>
<v Speaker 2>sauna to,</v>

3190
02:22:34.610 --> 02:22:36.660
<v Speaker 2>to really heat up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least in my experience,</v>

3191
02:22:36.690 --> 02:22:39.030
<v Speaker 2>they only go up to 140 or something </v>
<v Speaker 2>Fahrenheit.</v>

3192
02:22:39.600 --> 02:22:40.433
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of benefits come from like one</v>
<v Speaker 2>80 when you get up to like a one 80 </v>

3193
02:22:43.380 --> 02:22:44.213
<v Speaker 2>Fahrenheit.</v>

3194
02:22:44.650 --> 02:22:48.660
<v Speaker 2>My cranks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to mind your one out here.</v>

3195
02:22:48.690 --> 02:22:49.590
<v Speaker 2>You're a regular,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're hot.</v>

3196
02:22:49.591 --> 02:22:51.810
<v Speaker 2>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That thing gets too fucking hot.</v>

3197
02:22:52.320 --> 02:22:53.153
<v Speaker 2>It gets to 200 all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I have to open up the door </v>

3198
02:22:55.770 --> 02:22:59.550
<v Speaker 2>to your ears start to hurt and it's not </v>
<v Speaker 2>even my feet hurt again,</v>

3199
02:22:59.551 --> 02:23:02.980
<v Speaker 2>it's not even close to pegged.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like in terms of like the,</v>

3200
02:23:02.981 --> 02:23:04.440
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the full temperature one,</v>

3201
02:23:04.650 --> 02:23:06.900
<v Speaker 2>I just have a really hot one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3202
02:23:07.140 --> 02:23:09.410
<v Speaker 2>So I think that heats really important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like one of the leg.</v>

3203
02:23:10.140 --> 02:23:10.891
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

3204
02:23:10.891 --> 02:23:11.724
<v Speaker 2>One 80 for 20 minutes is where it sort </v>
<v Speaker 2>of like a lot of studies published by </v>

3205
02:23:16.201 --> 02:23:18.710
<v Speaker 2>like Dr Dre,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are locking in Finland.</v>

3206
02:23:18.720 --> 02:23:20.940
<v Speaker 2>He's shown a lot of benefits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3207
02:23:20.970 --> 02:23:21.803
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of his studies have been </v>

3208
02:23:22.890 --> 02:23:23.723
<v Speaker 2>observational,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's also done some intervention </v>

3209
02:23:25.321 --> 02:23:27.180
<v Speaker 2>trials as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3210
02:23:27.270 --> 02:23:28.103
<v Speaker 2>the observational studies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've talked about improvements in </v>

3211
02:23:29.860 --> 02:23:32.640
<v Speaker 2>cardiac,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cardiovascular related mortality.</v>

3212
02:23:32.910 --> 02:23:34.400
<v Speaker 2>Allison,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like literally like people,</v>

3213
02:23:34.410 --> 02:23:35.243
<v Speaker 2>people do it four to seven times a week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have like a 50 percent improvement </v>

3214
02:23:37.231 --> 02:23:39.490
<v Speaker 2>in cardiovascular rate of mortality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3215
02:23:39.510 --> 02:23:41.670
<v Speaker 2>three to four,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three to four times a week,</v>

3216
02:23:42.150 --> 02:23:42.983
<v Speaker 2>or was it two to get three to four times</v>
<v Speaker 2>a week to three times a week is like 24 </v>

3217
02:23:45.511 --> 02:23:47.670
<v Speaker 2>percent improvement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like a dose dependent manner,</v>

3218
02:23:47.671 --> 02:23:48.504
<v Speaker 2>Alzheimer's disease as well as reduced </v>
<v Speaker 2>by like 60 percent if you do it four to </v>

3219
02:23:51.451 --> 02:23:53.580
<v Speaker 2>seven times a week,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all cause mortality.</v>

3220
02:23:53.940 --> 02:23:54.773
<v Speaker 2>But he's also done some intervention </v>
<v Speaker 2>studies showing that like there's </v>

3221
02:23:56.251 --> 02:23:57.380
<v Speaker 2>improvements,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3222
02:23:57.390 --> 02:23:59.520
<v Speaker 2>if even a single dose of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of doing the sauna,</v>

3223
02:23:59.950 --> 02:24:02.990
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>improvements in the ability of your,</v>

3224
02:24:02.991 --> 02:24:03.824
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your blood vessels to contract and </v>

3225
02:24:05.431 --> 02:24:07.740
<v Speaker 2>expand with pressure changes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is important.</v>

3226
02:24:07.741 --> 02:24:08.574
<v Speaker 2>So it's like vascular compliance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's called improvements in blood </v>

3227
02:24:10.861 --> 02:24:14.810
<v Speaker 2>pressure decreases in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a Syriac.</v>

3228
02:24:14.820 --> 02:24:15.653
<v Speaker 2>The protein inflammatory biomarker </v>
<v Speaker 2>studies have been showing recently in </v>

3229
02:24:19.251 --> 02:24:21.900
<v Speaker 2>humans increase in mitochondrial </v>
<v Speaker 2>biogenesis,</v>

3230
02:24:21.901 --> 02:24:23.730
<v Speaker 2>growing new healthy Mitochondria.</v>

3231
02:24:24.330 --> 02:24:26.980
<v Speaker 2>Improvements in mitochondrial function,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3232
02:24:27.960 --> 02:24:28.793
<v Speaker 2>and then also improve in improvements in</v>
<v Speaker 2>a anti inflammatory cytokines being </v>

3233
02:24:33.451 --> 02:24:35.370
<v Speaker 2>increased in these are all intervention </v>
<v Speaker 2>trials as well.</v>

3234
02:24:36.270 --> 02:24:40.080
<v Speaker 2>People that are doing it with a before </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing a workout,</v>

3235
02:24:40.110 --> 02:24:41.680
<v Speaker 2>which is interesting because I've always</v>
<v Speaker 2>done after.</v>

3236
02:24:42.150 --> 02:24:42.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

3237
02:24:42.870 --> 02:24:44.370
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so doing it before workout,</v>

3238
02:24:44.390 --> 02:24:47.400
<v Speaker 2>it reduced delayed onset muscle </v>
<v Speaker 2>soreness.</v>

3239
02:24:47.850 --> 02:24:48.683
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing it before a workout,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is weird because 20 minutes </v>

3240
02:24:50.731 --> 02:24:51.564
<v Speaker 2>before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember the exact amount of </v>

3241
02:24:53.341 --> 02:24:55.140
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that um,</v>

3242
02:24:55.950 --> 02:24:58.590
<v Speaker 2>it was a little bit of a different </v>
<v Speaker 2>protocol for that study.</v>

3243
02:24:59.190 --> 02:25:01.080
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember off the top of my head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3244
02:25:01.081 --> 02:25:02.960
<v Speaker 2>I did tweet it at some point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3245
02:25:03.540 --> 02:25:04.373
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really interesting because I doing </v>

3246
02:25:06.451 --> 02:25:07.284
<v Speaker 2>it before it seems like I'm so burnt out</v>
<v Speaker 2>like after doing the sauna it's like </v>

3247
02:25:10.350 --> 02:25:11.183
<v Speaker 2>going into a workout after that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So maybe would they have the same </v>

3248
02:25:13.201 --> 02:25:15.210
<v Speaker 2>effects effects afterwards after,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3249
02:25:15.240 --> 02:25:16.050
<v Speaker 2>doing it afterwards?</v>

3250
02:25:16.050 --> 02:25:16.883
<v Speaker 2>Possibly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what's super interesting is the </v>

3251
02:25:19.441 --> 02:25:22.020
<v Speaker 2>effects on the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like have you noticed,</v>

3252
02:25:22.021 --> 02:25:24.100
<v Speaker 2>do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you feel any feel great?</v>

3253
02:25:24.410 --> 02:25:25.243
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I come out of there I feel just </v>

3254
02:25:26.080 --> 02:25:27.310
<v Speaker 2>chilled out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>relaxed,</v>

3255
02:25:27.311 --> 02:25:28.900
<v Speaker 2>I feel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel really good.</v>

3256
02:25:28.901 --> 02:25:31.870
<v Speaker 2>I just feel good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel alleviated.</v>

3257
02:25:31.990 --> 02:25:34.660
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly the reason I even got </v>
<v Speaker 2>interested in Sana was I,</v>

3258
02:25:34.690 --> 02:25:35.523
<v Speaker 2>that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was doing it regularly and I started </v>

3259
02:25:36.551 --> 02:25:40.630
<v Speaker 2>to notice that I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I recently met up with a researcher.</v>

3260
02:25:40.631 --> 02:25:43.160
<v Speaker 2>His name is Dr Charles Raison,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3261
02:25:43.210 --> 02:25:45.550
<v Speaker 2>I recorded a podcast with him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very interesting guy,</v>

3262
02:25:45.880 --> 02:25:46.713
<v Speaker 2>but he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a devised this really cool gadget where </v>

3263
02:25:51.131 --> 02:25:55.030
<v Speaker 2>he could elevate people's core body </v>
<v Speaker 2>temperature by like a,</v>

3264
02:25:55.480 --> 02:25:58.690
<v Speaker 2>a degree and a half,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he had a sham control,</v>

3265
02:25:58.710 --> 02:25:59.920
<v Speaker 2>a placebo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so to speak.</v>

3266
02:26:00.280 --> 02:26:01.480
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

3267
02:26:01.510 --> 02:26:05.200
<v Speaker 2>so the placebo did increase people's </v>
<v Speaker 2>core body temperature a little bit,</v>

3268
02:26:05.201 --> 02:26:07.420
<v Speaker 2>but not to that amount,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not to that degree.</v>

3269
02:26:07.840 --> 02:26:11.280
<v Speaker 2>So people thought they were getting the </v>
<v Speaker 2>active treatment so they weren't hot.</v>

3270
02:26:11.820 --> 02:26:13.150
<v Speaker 2>They were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they thought they were getting high.</v>

3271
02:26:13.151 --> 02:26:15.970
<v Speaker 2>And in fact he said when asked </v>
<v Speaker 2>afterwards,</v>

3272
02:26:15.971 --> 02:26:18.160
<v Speaker 2>like 70 percent of them thought they got</v>
<v Speaker 2>the active treatment.</v>

3273
02:26:19.330 --> 02:26:20.163
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's actually a nice placebo </v>

3274
02:26:21.761 --> 02:26:23.670
<v Speaker 2>controlled study.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

3275
02:26:23.680 --> 02:26:25.360
<v Speaker 2>what he found was that even a single </v>
<v Speaker 2>treatment,</v>

3276
02:26:25.660 --> 02:26:27.940
<v Speaker 2>these weren't people that had major </v>
<v Speaker 2>depressive disorder.</v>

3277
02:26:28.360 --> 02:26:31.330
<v Speaker 2>It improved depressive symptoms like </v>
<v Speaker 2>even a week,</v>

3278
02:26:31.330 --> 02:26:32.830
<v Speaker 2>week after.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this was just a single,</v>

3279
02:26:33.360 --> 02:26:35.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exposure to the sauna,</v>

3280
02:26:35.320 --> 02:26:37.690
<v Speaker 2>what sauna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not actually a sign I was like this</v>

3281
02:26:37.691 --> 02:26:39.820
<v Speaker 2>like heating device.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

3282
02:26:39.970 --> 02:26:43.210
<v Speaker 2>he also measured their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a cytokine called io six,</v>

3283
02:26:43.330 --> 02:26:46.740
<v Speaker 2>which is something that's released from </v>
<v Speaker 2>exercise muscle tissue releases.</v>

3284
02:26:46.750 --> 02:26:51.750
<v Speaker 2>It spills out into the bloodstream and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's part of the inflammatory response,</v>

3285
02:26:52.870 --> 02:26:55.180
<v Speaker 2>part of the inflammatory aspect of </v>
<v Speaker 2>exercise.</v>

3286
02:26:55.570 --> 02:26:58.040
<v Speaker 2>And in response there's a whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>anti-inflammatory,</v>

3287
02:26:58.450 --> 02:26:59.380
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>effect.</v>

3288
02:26:59.680 --> 02:27:00.630
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3289
02:27:00.670 --> 02:27:04.330
<v Speaker 2>what he showed is that actually people </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the more aisle six that happened,</v>

3290
02:27:04.570 --> 02:27:05.890
<v Speaker 2>the better they had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3291
02:27:06.350 --> 02:27:10.090
<v Speaker 2>antidepressant effect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's super interesting because,</v>

3292
02:27:10.110 --> 02:27:10.691
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

3293
02:27:10.691 --> 02:27:13.960
<v Speaker 2>exercise does that and in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you give people ensades or like,</v>

3294
02:27:14.010 --> 02:27:17.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so nonsteroidal anti inflammatories,</v>

3295
02:27:17.750 --> 02:27:19.060
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

3296
02:27:19.260 --> 02:27:20.093
<v Speaker 2>and before exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it actually blunts the aisle six </v>

3297
02:27:23.021 --> 02:27:23.854
<v Speaker 2>production and it blends some of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>positive benefits like insulin </v>

3298
02:27:25.541 --> 02:27:28.150
<v Speaker 2>sensitivity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the aisle six,</v>

3299
02:27:28.151 --> 02:27:31.060
<v Speaker 2>although it's an inflammatory cytokine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of like this,</v>

3300
02:27:31.450 --> 02:27:34.810
<v Speaker 2>a sort of a pleiotropic one that it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>released,</v>

3301
02:27:34.811 --> 02:27:35.644
<v Speaker 2>it's in muscle tissue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's released and it seems to like </v>

3302
02:27:37.180 --> 02:27:38.013
<v Speaker 2>increase,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a big anti inflammatory response </v>

3303
02:27:40.811 --> 02:27:44.740
<v Speaker 2>that happens in response to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was really interesting because the</v>

3304
02:27:44.741 --> 02:27:45.574
<v Speaker 2>inflammation seems to be really </v>
<v Speaker 2>important for depression and that the </v>

3305
02:27:48.671 --> 02:27:49.840
<v Speaker 2>sauna was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3306
02:27:49.870 --> 02:27:53.620
<v Speaker 2>basically basically lowering markers of </v>
<v Speaker 2>inflammation.</v>

3307
02:27:53.621 --> 02:27:57.460
<v Speaker 2>So it's been shown to lower c reactor </v>
<v Speaker 2>protein and then also increase aisle 10.</v>

3308
02:27:58.030 --> 02:28:02.050
<v Speaker 2>So it's a very interesting kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>connection between mood,</v>

3309
02:28:02.140 --> 02:28:03.220
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>heat stress.</v>

3310
02:28:03.221 --> 02:28:04.840
<v Speaker 2>And then of course exercise is the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

3311
02:28:04.841 --> 02:28:07.480
<v Speaker 2>Exercise does elevate your core body </v>
<v Speaker 2>temperature and heats you up.</v>

3312
02:28:07.750 --> 02:28:08.583
<v Speaker 2>And I asked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3313
02:28:08.590 --> 02:28:11.050
<v Speaker 2>Dr Liaison,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he thinks that things like the sauna,</v>

3314
02:28:11.051 --> 02:28:12.580
<v Speaker 2>hot yoga,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hot bath,</v>

3315
02:28:12.640 --> 02:28:13.473
<v Speaker 2>steam room,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all those things are pretty much can </v>

3316
02:28:15.401 --> 02:28:17.680
<v Speaker 2>give you the same effect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The point is the heat stress,</v>

3317
02:28:17.710 --> 02:28:18.543
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure that yoga does the same </v>

3318
02:28:20.350 --> 02:28:22.160
<v Speaker 2>with hot yoga because I have that same</v>

3319
02:28:22.160 --> 02:28:24.080
<v Speaker 4>feeling when I get out of a hot yoga </v>
<v Speaker 4>class.</v>

3320
02:28:24.400 --> 02:28:25.233
<v Speaker 4>It,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is like really good alleviation </v>

3321
02:28:27.321 --> 02:28:28.190
<v Speaker 4>feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>

3322
02:28:28.430 --> 02:28:29.263
<v Speaker 4>my mood feels elevated,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel happier and it feels different </v>

3323
02:28:32.361 --> 02:28:35.120
<v Speaker 4>than a regular workout,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like regular workout does that.</v>

3324
02:28:35.121 --> 02:28:36.520
<v Speaker 4>But it seems more,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3325
02:28:36.570 --> 02:28:38.420
<v Speaker 4>an alleviation of stress.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

3326
02:28:38.421 --> 02:28:39.254
<v Speaker 4>I've expelled the excess energy in my </v>
<v Speaker 4>body and I can relax and there's </v>

3327
02:28:42.290 --> 02:28:44.580
<v Speaker 4>certainly some sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3328
02:28:44.860 --> 02:28:45.693
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some sort of a positive hormonal effect </v>

3329
02:28:49.850 --> 02:28:51.510
<v Speaker 4>after it's over.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3330
02:28:51.680 --> 02:28:55.280
<v Speaker 4>some endorphin rush.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it's not the same as the yoga.</v>

3331
02:28:55.310 --> 02:28:56.143
<v Speaker 4>The hot yoga I think is very addictive </v>
<v Speaker 4>to people and that's one of the reasons </v>

3332
02:28:58.911 --> 02:29:01.190
<v Speaker 4>because after it's over,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you feel amazing.</v>

3333
02:29:01.191 --> 02:29:02.200
<v Speaker 4>You feel so good.</v>

3334
02:29:02.460 --> 02:29:05.430
<v Speaker 2>There's studies showing that hot yoga </v>
<v Speaker 2>does improve depressive symptoms.</v>

3335
02:29:05.431 --> 02:29:06.500
<v Speaker 2>They're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no plus,</v>

3336
02:29:06.530 --> 02:29:07.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sham control.</v>

3337
02:29:07.980 --> 02:29:08.813
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a researcher at Harvard </v>
<v Speaker 2>Public School of Health who's trying to </v>

3338
02:29:12.121 --> 02:29:12.954
<v Speaker 2>develop,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to do a study with how you're </v>

3339
02:29:14.701 --> 02:29:15.534
<v Speaker 2>doing it right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are they with her with a control random </v>

3340
02:29:17.071 --> 02:29:18.400
<v Speaker 2>and now they're in the</v>

3341
02:29:18.700 --> 02:29:21.670
<v Speaker 4>about yoga is that it's only 104 degrees</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the room.</v>

3342
02:29:21.940 --> 02:29:26.770
<v Speaker 4>But when you take into account the </v>
<v Speaker 4>extreme condition of the exercise,</v>

3343
02:29:26.771 --> 02:29:28.450
<v Speaker 4>extreme stress that you're putting on </v>
<v Speaker 4>your body,</v>

3344
02:29:28.720 --> 02:29:29.553
<v Speaker 4>a lot of it is like really difficult </v>
<v Speaker 4>balancing and you're straining and all </v>

3345
02:29:32.411 --> 02:29:33.244
<v Speaker 4>your mind,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your fucking sweating and you're not </v>

3346
02:29:35.140 --> 02:29:36.580
<v Speaker 4>sweating like 100,</v>
<v Speaker 4>four degrees.</v>

3347
02:29:36.581 --> 02:29:38.530
<v Speaker 4>You're sweating just like you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>sweating inside the song,</v>

3348
02:29:38.531 --> 02:29:38.920
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3349
02:29:38.920 --> 02:29:40.250
<v Speaker 2>Like big time sweat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3350
02:29:40.251 --> 02:29:41.084
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3351
02:29:41.170 --> 02:29:41.490
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

3352
02:29:41.490 --> 02:29:45.150
<v Speaker 4>Like there's certain ones that are like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you're do a bouncing stick,</v>

3353
02:29:45.151 --> 02:29:45.984
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm standing in front of me like this </v>

3354
02:29:47.040 --> 02:29:51.780
<v Speaker 4>and I'm watching it just pour off my </v>
<v Speaker 4>arms just watching sweat drip off me.</v>

3355
02:29:52.070 --> 02:29:52.903
<v Speaker 2>I sweat when I'm doing yoga,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like non what I'm holding those </v>

3356
02:29:55.611 --> 02:29:57.770
<v Speaker 2>positions in a non hot environment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

3357
02:29:57.771 --> 02:29:58.604
<v Speaker 2>So I haven't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've done a big room yoga a couple of </v>

3358
02:30:00.141 --> 02:30:00.974
<v Speaker 2>times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been the hot yoga a couple of </v>

3359
02:30:01.581 --> 02:30:02.700
<v Speaker 2>times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3360
02:30:02.810 --> 02:30:03.643
<v Speaker 2>I do really like it instead of have more</v>
<v Speaker 2>time to see what might be minutes is a </v>

3361
02:30:07.311 --> 02:30:09.330
<v Speaker 2>long time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3362
02:30:09.380 --> 02:30:10.580
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the Endorphin,</v>

3363
02:30:10.610 --> 02:30:13.640
<v Speaker 2>you dump a bunch of endorphins with uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the sauna as well,</v>

3364
02:30:13.641 --> 02:30:15.320
<v Speaker 2>like tons and tons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there's the whole,</v>

3365
02:30:15.321 --> 02:30:16.400
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

3366
02:30:16.430 --> 02:30:17.263
<v Speaker 2>you're making dynorphins which is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of opposite of endorphin </v>

3367
02:30:20.480 --> 02:30:21.650
<v Speaker 2>responsible for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3368
02:30:21.970 --> 02:30:26.970
<v Speaker 2>so that changes some of the least in </v>
<v Speaker 2>animal studies at Petronas to change the</v>

3369
02:30:27.861 --> 02:30:32.240
<v Speaker 2>sensitivity to endorphins.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm from the receptor standpoint.</v>

3370
02:30:32.720 --> 02:30:35.750
<v Speaker 2>So it's kind of interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's kind of initially what I,</v>

3371
02:30:35.810 --> 02:30:36.643
<v Speaker 2>what I originally was looking into when </v>
<v Speaker 2>I was noticing all these benefits from </v>

3372
02:30:39.291 --> 02:30:41.660
<v Speaker 2>the sauna,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's really cool that you're doing</v>

3373
02:30:41.661 --> 02:30:42.494
<v Speaker 2>it because there's so many studies now </v>
<v Speaker 2>showing that there's benefits on the </v>

3374
02:30:44.661 --> 02:30:46.400
<v Speaker 2>cardiovascular health.</v>

3375
02:30:46.430 --> 02:30:49.160
<v Speaker 2>I'm also on neurogenic disease </v>
<v Speaker 2>depression.</v>

3376
02:30:49.161 --> 02:30:51.140
<v Speaker 2>I mean the antiinflammatory effects as </v>
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

3377
02:30:51.470 --> 02:30:55.040
<v Speaker 2>It's so easy to have it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have it right here and just to be able</v>

3378
02:30:55.140 --> 02:30:58.790
<v Speaker 2>to get into the sauna anytime I want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I basically doing it every day.</v>

3379
02:30:58.820 --> 02:30:59.750
<v Speaker 2>That's nice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3380
02:30:59.870 --> 02:31:02.480
<v Speaker 2>Right now I've been taking hot baths </v>
<v Speaker 2>just because I haven't,</v>

3381
02:31:03.110 --> 02:31:03.720
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

3382
02:31:03.720 --> 02:31:06.690
<v Speaker 2>we're trying to like get to the point </v>
<v Speaker 2>where we have a sauna but um,</v>

3383
02:31:06.800 --> 02:31:10.700
<v Speaker 2>I think we're gonna get there soon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But a hot baths had been doing it for me</v>

3384
02:31:10.701 --> 02:31:13.160
<v Speaker 2>as well where I am like submerge my </v>
<v Speaker 2>shoulders.</v>

3385
02:31:13.640 --> 02:31:14.473
<v Speaker 2>I mean you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if you start putting your arms and </v>

3386
02:31:15.561 --> 02:31:16.394
<v Speaker 2>legs out of the water,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it doesn't count because I feel </v>

3387
02:31:18.231 --> 02:31:20.460
<v Speaker 2>cooler if you'd like stay underneath.</v>

3388
02:31:20.480 --> 02:31:22.680
<v Speaker 3>I mean you're freaking out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're heart starts racing,</v>

3389
02:31:23.310 --> 02:31:24.143
<v Speaker 3>racing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's like the same effect that </v>

3390
02:31:24.961 --> 02:31:29.961
<v Speaker 3>happens where you're elevated heart rate</v>
<v Speaker 3>and all those sort of similar mechanisms</v>

3391
02:31:29.971 --> 02:31:32.280
<v Speaker 3>kick into play like they do when you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>in a sauna.</v>

3392
02:31:32.340 --> 02:31:34.830
<v Speaker 3>Do you do epsom salt baths as well?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have.</v>

3393
02:31:34.950 --> 02:31:35.783
<v Speaker 3>I really like them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I've been doing really hot baths </v>

3394
02:31:37.591 --> 02:31:38.424
<v Speaker 3>with epsom salts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially like after a very fatiguing </v>

3395
02:31:41.041 --> 02:31:45.270
<v Speaker 3>workouts seems to have a good benefit </v>
<v Speaker 3>and and I know from the tank,</v>

3396
02:31:45.271 --> 02:31:48.570
<v Speaker 3>from the isolation tank that it's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>great way of absorbing magnesium through</v>

3397
02:31:48.571 --> 02:31:49.610
<v Speaker 3>the epsom salts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3398
02:31:49.650 --> 02:31:50.483
<v Speaker 3>into your muscle through through skin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because epsom salts is so high in </v>

3399
02:31:54.301 --> 02:31:59.301
<v Speaker 3>magnesium in the tank is a thousand </v>
<v Speaker 3>pounds of epsom salts in it.</v>

3400
02:32:00.120 --> 02:32:03.620
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy to make your skin look nice </v>
<v Speaker 3>when you do it.</v>

3401
02:32:04.750 --> 02:32:06.030
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just feels good too,</v>

3402
02:32:06.360 --> 02:32:08.700
<v Speaker 3>but it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It feels really the tank.</v>

3403
02:32:08.730 --> 02:32:11.220
<v Speaker 3>Have you done it yet?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did it once.</v>

3404
02:32:11.310 --> 02:32:12.143
<v Speaker 3>I'm in San Francisco and you can do it </v>
<v Speaker 3>anytime you want if you want to come </v>

3405
02:32:16.561 --> 02:32:17.394
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was really something wasn't </v>

3406
02:32:20.911 --> 02:32:21.744
<v Speaker 3>right because I could feel like the </v>
<v Speaker 3>temperature of the water was off and I </v>

3407
02:32:25.861 --> 02:32:27.330
<v Speaker 3>did enjoy what I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

3408
02:32:27.420 --> 02:32:28.253
<v Speaker 3>I mean it was nice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So at first I got in and they had some </v>

3409
02:32:29.641 --> 02:32:32.850
<v Speaker 3>music playing music and then the music </v>
<v Speaker 3>went away.</v>

3410
02:32:32.940 --> 02:32:34.850
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to sort of relax you at first.</v>

3411
02:32:34.851 --> 02:32:36.020
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3412
02:32:36.450 --> 02:32:38.790
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did,</v>

3413
02:32:38.791 --> 02:32:42.180
<v Speaker 3>I was like sort of in my head a bit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3414
02:32:42.240 --> 02:32:43.073
<v Speaker 3>in that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I didn't,</v>

3415
02:32:43.090 --> 02:32:43.923
<v Speaker 3>I kept feeling the water and I thought I</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't feel like I was like sensory </v>

3416
02:32:45.691 --> 02:32:46.524
<v Speaker 3>deprived if you ever hear other than </v>
<v Speaker 3>like when you come down and do the </v>

3417
02:32:49.201 --> 02:32:51.300
<v Speaker 3>podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3418
02:32:51.360 --> 02:32:52.200
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do.</v>

3419
02:32:52.201 --> 02:32:53.034
<v Speaker 3>I'm coming back in November.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anytime you're here just let me know in </v>

3420
02:32:55.621 --> 02:32:57.150
<v Speaker 3>advance and we'll open it up.</v>

3421
02:32:57.150 --> 02:32:57.983
<v Speaker 3>And this tank here is the best.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The float lab or if you want to go to </v>

3422
02:33:00.961 --> 02:33:01.794
<v Speaker 3>the place in Venice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the one you can do here so easy and </v>

3423
02:33:03.511 --> 02:33:04.830
<v Speaker 3>it's got a shower in there and </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>

3424
02:33:04.831 --> 02:33:05.640
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that would be cool.</v>

3425
02:33:05.640 --> 02:33:07.380
<v Speaker 3>I would like to try it again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3426
02:33:07.560 --> 02:33:08.960
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's studies showing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3427
02:33:08.970 --> 02:33:11.360
<v Speaker 3>meditation and all that stuff is really </v>
<v Speaker 3>important for it.</v>

3428
02:33:11.400 --> 02:33:12.233
<v Speaker 3>I think it's an important one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the many components and like </v>

3429
02:33:15.991 --> 02:33:17.520
<v Speaker 3>healthy aging,</v>
<v Speaker 3>healthy brain aging,</v>

3430
02:33:17.521 --> 02:33:19.830
<v Speaker 3>lowering stress and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3431
02:33:20.100 --> 02:33:23.070
<v Speaker 3>so I would definitely like to get out of</v>
<v Speaker 3>that thing.</v>

3432
02:33:23.071 --> 02:33:25.140
<v Speaker 3>I feel great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll come frequently.</v>

3433
02:33:25.141 --> 02:33:25.974
<v Speaker 3>So that's right here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'll come down here early in the </v>

3434
02:33:28.710 --> 02:33:30.570
<v Speaker 3>morning and do it sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How long do you have to stay in there to</v>

3435
02:33:30.571 --> 02:33:33.660
<v Speaker 3>really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like at least an hour,</v>

3436
02:33:33.720 --> 02:33:36.930
<v Speaker 3>but I really like to do two hours.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Two hours for me is the sweet spot.</v>

3437
02:33:37.380 --> 02:33:39.380
<v Speaker 3>When I come out after two hours I'm just</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

3438
02:33:39.570 --> 02:33:43.200
<v Speaker 3>so chill out and it's almost like doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>sober October.</v>

3439
02:33:43.201 --> 02:33:45.570
<v Speaker 3>It's like cheating because you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>basically getting high in there.</v>

3440
02:33:46.080 --> 02:33:47.490
<v Speaker 3>Are you doing it during.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it worked out,</v>

3441
02:33:47.491 --> 02:33:48.930
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's not,</v>

3442
02:33:49.050 --> 02:33:53.070
<v Speaker 3>you're not taking a drug but you're so </v>
<v Speaker 3>chilled out,</v>

3443
02:33:53.400 --> 02:33:54.233
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you do have a weird psychedelic </v>

3444
02:33:55.471 --> 02:33:56.304
<v Speaker 3>state that you achieve when you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like a very extreme form of </v>

3445
02:33:59.401 --> 02:34:00.234
<v Speaker 3>meditation and a lot of ways because of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the fact that you're not feeling your </v>

3446
02:34:02.641 --> 02:34:03.474
<v Speaker 3>body at all and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're only experiencing whatever's </v>

3447
02:34:06.661 --> 02:34:07.494
<v Speaker 3>going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like your brain detached from all </v>

3448
02:34:10.141 --> 02:34:12.450
<v Speaker 3>the input of the body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some of those,</v>

3449
02:34:12.510 --> 02:34:13.343
<v Speaker 3>some of those studies that have been </v>
<v Speaker 3>done on like long term meditators or </v>

3450
02:34:16.021 --> 02:34:17.980
<v Speaker 3>even just people that haven't meditated</v>

3451
02:34:18.250 --> 02:34:19.083
<v Speaker 2>and then they're put in like some like </v>
<v Speaker 2>eight week trial of meditation and how </v>

3452
02:34:22.151 --> 02:34:22.984
<v Speaker 2>there's like immediately all these </v>
<v Speaker 2>changes in brain activity start to </v>

3453
02:34:25.541 --> 02:34:30.541
<v Speaker 2>happen like that are basically in line </v>
<v Speaker 2>with good brain aging and improved.</v>

3454
02:34:31.661 --> 02:34:32.494
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all sorts of measures or measures have </v>

3455
02:34:33.401 --> 02:34:37.420
<v Speaker 2>improved cognitive function and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's super interesting.</v>

3456
02:34:37.690 --> 02:34:39.340
<v Speaker 2>It would be really interesting to see </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3457
02:34:39.970 --> 02:34:43.010
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how that differs from meditations.</v>

3458
02:34:43.030 --> 02:34:44.820
<v Speaker 2>One thing I have a hard time with like I</v>
<v Speaker 2>real,</v>

3459
02:34:44.821 --> 02:34:45.950
<v Speaker 2>it's well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meditation and</v>

3460
02:34:46.070 --> 02:34:48.310
<v Speaker 1>injunction with the tank I think is </v>
<v Speaker 1>really the key.</v>

3461
02:34:48.440 --> 02:34:51.970
<v Speaker 1>I think the tank allows you to achieve a</v>
<v Speaker 1>state of physical,</v>

3462
02:34:52.150 --> 02:34:52.983
<v Speaker 1>your physical body not being or not I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't ever completely eliminate the </v>

3463
02:35:00.131 --> 02:35:00.964
<v Speaker 1>sensory input,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you diminish it so significantly </v>

3464
02:35:03.791 --> 02:35:04.624
<v Speaker 1>that that environment is not available </v>
<v Speaker 1>anywhere else on earth where you're </v>

3465
02:35:07.031 --> 02:35:07.864
<v Speaker 1>floating so you don't feel your body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your water is the temperature of your </v>

3466
02:35:11.501 --> 02:35:12.334
<v Speaker 1>skin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The air is the same temperature as the </v>

3467
02:35:13.571 --> 02:35:17.080
<v Speaker 1>water and you feel like just flying </v>
<v Speaker 1>through infinity,</v>

3468
02:35:17.290 --> 02:35:19.090
<v Speaker 1>you're in total darkness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Total silence.</v>

3469
02:35:19.170 --> 02:35:20.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't feel that way.</v>

3470
02:35:20.780 --> 02:35:22.590
<v Speaker 2>I mean I did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a little relaxed.</v>

3471
02:35:22.660 --> 02:35:24.800
<v Speaker 2>I didn't feel like I was like flying </v>
<v Speaker 2>through</v>

3472
02:35:25.550 --> 02:35:26.570
<v Speaker 1>for tanks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

3473
02:35:26.590 --> 02:35:28.510
<v Speaker 1>that's part of the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of the tanks,</v>

3474
02:35:28.840 --> 02:35:29.673
<v Speaker 1>the water the entire time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're probably either too cold or too </v>

3475
02:35:32.481 --> 02:35:32.990
<v Speaker 1>hot.</v>

3476
02:35:32.990 --> 02:35:33.823
<v Speaker 2>It should.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You feel like your brain is like a in </v>

3477
02:35:35.991 --> 02:35:37.610
<v Speaker 2>the now when you're doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that something.</v>

3478
02:35:37.640 --> 02:35:38.473
<v Speaker 1>I feel like my brain is has way more </v>
<v Speaker 1>resource reece way more resources </v>

3479
02:35:43.851 --> 02:35:44.684
<v Speaker 1>available to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like if you and I are having this </v>

3480
02:35:47.091 --> 02:35:47.924
<v Speaker 1>conversation and we didn't have the </v>
<v Speaker 1>headphones on and there was a Jack </v>

3481
02:35:50.810 --> 02:35:52.730
<v Speaker 1>Hammer next to us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would be really distracting.</v>

3482
02:35:52.731 --> 02:35:54.080
<v Speaker 1>You'd want to get away from that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jackhammer,</v>

3483
02:35:54.110 --> 02:35:56.060
<v Speaker 1>like let's go talk over here until you'd</v>
<v Speaker 1>want.</v>

3484
02:35:56.090 --> 02:35:58.010
<v Speaker 1>You'd want to get away as far as you </v>
<v Speaker 1>could from.</v>

3485
02:35:58.310 --> 02:35:59.143
<v Speaker 1>But everything is a distraction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the seat on my butt is a </v>

3486
02:36:02.631 --> 02:36:06.020
<v Speaker 1>distraction with the shoes on my feet or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

3487
02:36:06.021 --> 02:36:09.380
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking about the watch on my hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does all these different things that are</v>

3488
02:36:09.381 --> 02:36:11.480
<v Speaker 1>distracting you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you get in that tank,</v>

3489
02:36:11.481 --> 02:36:13.910
<v Speaker 1>there's none of those things you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just,</v>

3490
02:36:14.720 --> 02:36:18.890
<v Speaker 1>you settle in and once you settle in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you touch each side so that you can,</v>

3491
02:36:18.920 --> 02:36:20.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you get in the waters like a few</v>

3492
02:36:20.841 --> 02:36:25.400
<v Speaker 1>whip ripples and little little waves and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you touch each side.</v>

3493
02:36:25.400 --> 02:36:29.930
<v Speaker 1>So you calm everything down and then I </v>
<v Speaker 1>sink into the water and then I take some</v>

3494
02:36:29.931 --> 02:36:32.520
<v Speaker 1>deep breaths and then I slowly bring my </v>
<v Speaker 1>arms,</v>

3495
02:36:32.570 --> 02:36:36.920
<v Speaker 1>the middle and then a chill out and I've</v>
<v Speaker 1>done it so many times my body's goes,</v>

3496
02:36:36.921 --> 02:36:38.330
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here we go again.</v>

3497
02:36:38.390 --> 02:36:39.620
<v Speaker 1>Like it's not like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

3498
02:36:39.621 --> 02:36:41.540
<v Speaker 1>what is this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a weird.</v>

3499
02:36:42.020 --> 02:36:47.020
<v Speaker 1>I've done it so many times that my body </v>
<v Speaker 1>gets into that state very quickly.</v>

3500
02:36:47.091 --> 02:36:47.924
<v Speaker 1>But if I take time off and I do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes I'll take weeks or even a </v>

3501
02:36:50.391 --> 02:36:53.450
<v Speaker 1>month off and then it's a little more </v>
<v Speaker 1>weird at first.</v>

3502
02:36:53.451 --> 02:36:53.841
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3503
02:36:53.841 --> 02:36:55.070
<v Speaker 1>we're doing this again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3504
02:36:55.071 --> 02:36:55.904
<v Speaker 1>I haven't done this in awhile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when I do it consistently on a </v>

3505
02:36:58.131 --> 02:37:02.270
<v Speaker 1>regular basis to three times a week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I could just sink right into it.</v>

3506
02:37:02.540 --> 02:37:03.373
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if it would be any therapeutic </v>
<v Speaker 2>benefit to people with like sensory </v>

3507
02:37:05.871 --> 02:37:08.240
<v Speaker 2>gating disorders,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sensory gating,</v>

3508
02:37:08.330 --> 02:37:09.020
<v Speaker 2>our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3509
02:37:09.020 --> 02:37:11.200
<v Speaker 2>in other words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you were mentioning all the senses,</v>

3510
02:37:11.270 --> 02:37:13.730
<v Speaker 2>other sensory things that are happening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3511
02:37:13.731 --> 02:37:15.080
<v Speaker 2>there's auditory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

3512
02:37:15.890 --> 02:37:16.723
<v Speaker 2>there's a visual.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean these things are our brains </v>

3513
02:37:18.201 --> 02:37:19.034
<v Speaker 2>inputting it at all times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's stuff going on but we're </v>

3514
02:37:20.871 --> 02:37:23.450
<v Speaker 2>able to kind of filter it out and like </v>
<v Speaker 2>you and I are having this conversation.</v>

3515
02:37:23.451 --> 02:37:24.284
<v Speaker 2>Jamie's been sitting over the whole time</v>
<v Speaker 2>and like I really haven't paid much </v>

3516
02:37:25.941 --> 02:37:26.720
<v Speaker 2>attention,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

3517
02:37:26.720 --> 02:37:27.553
<v Speaker 2>Attention thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But some people like particularly </v>

3518
02:37:29.871 --> 02:37:31.640
<v Speaker 2>schizophrenia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people with schizophrenia,</v>

3519
02:37:31.760 --> 02:37:33.590
<v Speaker 2>they can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't filter that out.</v>

3520
02:37:33.591 --> 02:37:37.430
<v Speaker 2>And so like they get overlooked but gets</v>
<v Speaker 2>like an overload.</v>

3521
02:37:37.431 --> 02:37:39.500
<v Speaker 2>It's called sensory overload.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so they oftentimes,</v>

3522
02:37:39.501 --> 02:37:41.360
<v Speaker 2>I can't go into like a room with a lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>of people.</v>

3523
02:37:41.361 --> 02:37:44.150
<v Speaker 2>They want to like go off and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

3524
02:37:44.280 --> 02:37:45.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by themselves or whatever.</v>

3525
02:37:45.411 --> 02:37:46.244
<v Speaker 2>So I wonder if there's any sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>benefit for like doing something like </v>

3526
02:37:50.751 --> 02:37:52.310
<v Speaker 2>that where you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where you're not,</v>

3527
02:37:52.400 --> 02:37:54.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the sensory inputs,</v>

3528
02:37:54.321 --> 02:37:56.960
<v Speaker 2>Kinda like if you could kind of train </v>
<v Speaker 2>your brain a little bit.</v>

3529
02:37:57.200 --> 02:37:58.460
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

3530
02:37:59.650 --> 02:38:00.483
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

3531
02:38:00.610 --> 02:38:02.480
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I find that for me it,</v>

3532
02:38:02.481 --> 02:38:07.240
<v Speaker 1>it helps me think way clear because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>feel like I have more brain available to</v>

3533
02:38:07.241 --> 02:38:08.074
<v Speaker 1>access.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like if you were trying to say </v>

3534
02:38:10.451 --> 02:38:11.284
<v Speaker 1>something that was very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very complicated and you're trying to </v>

3535
02:38:14.561 --> 02:38:17.410
<v Speaker 1>explain something that required a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the resources of your brain.</v>

3536
02:38:17.411 --> 02:38:19.690
<v Speaker 1>If there was a lot of noise around you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't be able to do it.</v>

3537
02:38:19.930 --> 02:38:21.210
<v Speaker 1>But if there was a lot of noise you </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

3538
02:38:21.220 --> 02:38:23.450
<v Speaker 1>you want to eat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's go eat and you're like Bah Bah Bah</v>

3539
02:38:23.450 --> 02:38:24.580
<v Speaker 1>Bah Bah Ba.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some Jack Hammer.</v>

3540
02:38:24.750 --> 02:38:25.451
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm hungry.</v>

3541
02:38:25.451 --> 02:38:26.171
<v Speaker 1>You wanna eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3542
02:38:26.171 --> 02:38:27.004
<v Speaker 1>let's go eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you could be able to communicate </v>

3543
02:38:28.061 --> 02:38:31.520
<v Speaker 1>something very simple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you were trying to explain the,</v>

3544
02:38:31.610 --> 02:38:36.610
<v Speaker 1>the various mechanisms are really try </v>
<v Speaker 1>this because I think it</v>

3545
02:38:37.270 --> 02:38:40.000
<v Speaker 2>go through like this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I also sometimes use the sauna for that.</v>

3546
02:38:40.001 --> 02:38:43.450
<v Speaker 2>We're all like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have something prepared.</v>

3547
02:38:44.260 --> 02:38:46.660
<v Speaker 2>I used to actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>before giving a presentation,</v>

3548
02:38:46.661 --> 02:38:48.880
<v Speaker 2>I would go in the sauna and I would go </v>
<v Speaker 2>through it in my head,</v>

3549
02:38:49.160 --> 02:38:50.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's like,</v>

3550
02:38:50.670 --> 02:38:51.503
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was something that I used to do a </v>

3551
02:38:52.541 --> 02:38:53.374
<v Speaker 2>lot.</v>

3552
02:38:54.180 --> 02:38:55.013
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing in there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just you sitting there and it gives you </v>

3553
02:38:57.721 --> 02:39:01.170
<v Speaker 1>that unusual environment of just silence</v>
<v Speaker 1>really helped.</v>

3554
02:39:01.171 --> 02:39:02.004
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's kind of interesting that you </v>

3555
02:39:03.691 --> 02:39:07.020
<v Speaker 1>mentioned that that's a step toward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think the,</v>

3556
02:39:07.080 --> 02:39:12.080
<v Speaker 1>the float tank is the ultimate and right</v>
<v Speaker 1>now there's a really interesting podcast</v>

3557
02:39:12.481 --> 02:39:14.200
<v Speaker 1>that's available.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3558
02:39:14.250 --> 02:39:15.780
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've talked with this podcast before,</v>

3559
02:39:15.781 --> 02:39:17.880
<v Speaker 1>stuff to blow your mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have a,</v>

3560
02:39:17.910 --> 02:39:22.230
<v Speaker 1>an episode right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this week that is about John Lilly,</v>

3561
02:39:22.590 --> 02:39:27.590
<v Speaker 1>who was the psychedelic pioneer who </v>
<v Speaker 1>created the sensory deprivation tank and</v>

3562
02:39:27.751 --> 02:39:31.890
<v Speaker 1>he also is a pioneer and interspecies </v>
<v Speaker 1>communication.</v>

3563
02:39:31.920 --> 02:39:32.753
<v Speaker 1>Figured out how to communicate with </v>
<v Speaker 1>dolphins and did a bunch of weird </v>

3564
02:39:36.511 --> 02:39:39.120
<v Speaker 1>psychedelic research with dolphins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sarah is from the vault,</v>

3565
02:39:39.150 --> 02:39:42.240
<v Speaker 1>John C dot Lilly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He a really amazing,</v>

3566
02:39:42.241 --> 02:39:45.480
<v Speaker 1>amazing guy who uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3567
02:39:45.500 --> 02:39:48.900
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they go deep into the history of his,</v>

3568
02:39:48.960 --> 02:39:52.380
<v Speaker 1>his career too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is just very varied.</v>

3569
02:39:52.590 --> 02:39:56.520
<v Speaker 1>Fucking really strange guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think is his great contribution is</v>

3570
02:39:56.521 --> 02:39:57.354
<v Speaker 1>not just understanding the sentient </v>
<v Speaker 1>nature of dolphins and how incredibly </v>

3571
02:40:01.831 --> 02:40:03.990
<v Speaker 1>complex their languages and how smart </v>
<v Speaker 1>they are,</v>

3572
02:40:03.991 --> 02:40:04.824
<v Speaker 1>but also the sensory deprivation tank,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I think is one of the most </v>

3573
02:40:08.890 --> 02:40:09.723
<v Speaker 1>underutilized tools for consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for exploring consciousness and just </v>

3574
02:40:13.500 --> 02:40:16.920
<v Speaker 1>relaxation and for me for examining </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas.</v>

3575
02:40:16.921 --> 02:40:17.754
<v Speaker 1>If I have an idea like I used to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just do a lot of Jujitsu and they're </v>

3576
02:40:20.880 --> 02:40:21.713
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would go into the tank and I would go </v>

3577
02:40:23.041 --> 02:40:25.770
<v Speaker 1>over moves because when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're completely,</v>

3578
02:40:25.870 --> 02:40:26.703
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would drill moves in my head like as </v>

3579
02:40:30.121 --> 02:40:32.760
<v Speaker 1>if I was doing them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would like clench,</v>

3580
02:40:32.820 --> 02:40:34.050
<v Speaker 1>hook,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roll,</v>

3581
02:40:34.080 --> 02:40:35.850
<v Speaker 1>talk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>grab sync.</v>

3582
02:40:36.090 --> 02:40:38.460
<v Speaker 1>I would do all these different things in</v>
<v Speaker 1>my head.</v>

3583
02:40:38.770 --> 02:40:40.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that would allow.</v>

3584
02:40:40.081 --> 02:40:40.914
<v Speaker 1>I would do that to get me to this like </v>
<v Speaker 1>relaxation state and now or I would go </v>

3585
02:40:45.361 --> 02:40:48.460
<v Speaker 1>over a joke that I'm struggling with or </v>
<v Speaker 1>a comedy bit.</v>

3586
02:40:48.470 --> 02:40:50.190
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is a better way to say this?</v>

3587
02:40:50.210 --> 02:40:52.140
<v Speaker 1>How's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the best way to get this across?</v>

3588
02:40:52.640 --> 02:40:53.473
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm saying it this way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's offensive or it's blunt and </v>

3589
02:40:55.981 --> 02:40:58.230
<v Speaker 1>it's not the funny part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm,</v>

3590
02:40:58.280 --> 02:41:00.420
<v Speaker 1>I'm taking a shortcut.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I,</v>

3591
02:41:00.980 --> 02:41:01.813
<v Speaker 1>and then I would go over it in my head </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then eventually once I would do </v>

3592
02:41:05.401 --> 02:41:06.234
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would get to this relaxation point </v>

3593
02:41:08.730 --> 02:41:11.220
<v Speaker 1>where then I could just concentrate only</v>
<v Speaker 1>on breathing.</v>

3594
02:41:11.460 --> 02:41:12.293
<v Speaker 1>So after I've worked out all the things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are bugging me and sometimes it </v>

3595
02:41:15.251 --> 02:41:18.630
<v Speaker 1>would be like a seminar on my life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd get in there.</v>

3596
02:41:18.810 --> 02:41:22.350
<v Speaker 1>And then as soon as I closed the door </v>
<v Speaker 1>and lay down,</v>

3597
02:41:22.351 --> 02:41:24.420
<v Speaker 1>I'd take a few deep breaths and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>it'd be like,</v>

3598
02:41:24.900 --> 02:41:26.460
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so here's what's wrong.</v>

3599
02:41:26.461 --> 02:41:28.380
<v Speaker 1>Fuck face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're doing too much of this,</v>

3600
02:41:28.490 --> 02:41:30.070
<v Speaker 1>cleaned you God damn office.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3601
02:41:30.140 --> 02:41:31.140
<v Speaker 1>how come you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3602
02:41:31.141 --> 02:41:34.770
<v Speaker 1>you only get eight out of 10 things down</v>
<v Speaker 1>in your to do list that's bothering you.</v>

3603
02:41:35.070 --> 02:41:35.903
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need to spend an hour a day just </v>

3604
02:41:37.411 --> 02:41:38.244
<v Speaker 1>doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And instead of drinking coffee and </v>

3605
02:41:40.471 --> 02:41:42.690
<v Speaker 1>looking at your phone before you work </v>
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>

3606
02:41:42.691 --> 02:41:45.030
<v Speaker 1>just fucking workout,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just get in there and get your.</v>

3607
02:41:45.150 --> 02:41:48.780
<v Speaker 1>You're wasting 20 minutes doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That 20 minutes you could have been done</v>

3608
02:41:48.781 --> 02:41:52.600
<v Speaker 1>20 minutes earlier and then you wouldn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to rush over here to do the podcast</v>

3609
02:41:52.740 --> 02:41:53.573
<v Speaker 1>and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it starts sort of giving me almost like </v>

3610
02:41:56.820 --> 02:42:01.120
<v Speaker 1>a subconscious of renovation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3611
02:42:01.121 --> 02:42:02.770
<v Speaker 1>like just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just sort of like,</v>

3612
02:42:03.030 --> 02:42:03.863
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like this is all this stuff and your </v>

3613
02:42:05.551 --> 02:42:06.384
<v Speaker 1>subconscious is disturbing you and </v>
<v Speaker 1>here's why it's disturbing you because </v>

3614
02:42:09.541 --> 02:42:11.850
<v Speaker 1>you've got all this clutter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's clean this shit up,</v>

3615
02:42:12.300 --> 02:42:13.890
<v Speaker 1>clean it up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get it together.</v>

3616
02:42:14.220 --> 02:42:15.053
<v Speaker 1>And it's been responsible for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of my focus and </v>

3617
02:42:17.611 --> 02:42:18.444
<v Speaker 1>discipline,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like understanding the significance of </v>

3618
02:42:21.270 --> 02:42:22.103
<v Speaker 1>that focus and discipline and it's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>just like to be a tough guy or the just </v>

3619
02:42:26.971 --> 02:42:28.080
<v Speaker 1>go out there and kick ass.</v>

3620
02:42:28.080 --> 02:42:32.520
<v Speaker 1>It's more like to absolve yourself of </v>
<v Speaker 1>brain clutter.</v>

3621
02:42:33.090 --> 02:42:34.930
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That introspection,</v>

3622
02:42:34.960 --> 02:42:38.190
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people could use more of that,</v>

3623
02:42:38.191 --> 02:42:40.020
<v Speaker 1>including myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's certainly,</v>

3624
02:42:40.080 --> 02:42:40.913
<v Speaker 1>I think all of us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it almost really anyone </v>

3625
02:42:42.691 --> 02:42:43.524
<v Speaker 1>listening to this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think there's probably one in San </v>

3626
02:42:46.020 --> 02:42:48.600
<v Speaker 1>Diego,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if there's a tank place in San Diego,</v>

3627
02:42:48.780 --> 02:42:49.613
<v Speaker 1>reach out to Dr Rhonda Patrick and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>sure that there's a place you could use </v>

3628
02:42:53.341 --> 02:42:54.540
<v Speaker 1>this down there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This near you.</v>

3629
02:42:54.680 --> 02:42:55.513
<v Speaker 1>I mean I certainly use other things like</v>
<v Speaker 1>a extra running long runs should do </v>

3630
02:42:58.771 --> 02:42:59.604
<v Speaker 1>something similar in that zone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what you're describing sounds kind </v>

3631
02:43:03.721 --> 02:43:04.554
<v Speaker 1>of like next level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people get it from swimming as </v>

3632
02:43:06.271 --> 02:43:08.290
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Swimming because it was just like,</v>

3633
02:43:09.480 --> 02:43:10.313
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that repetitive thing and then you're </v>

3634
02:43:12.700 --> 02:43:13.533
<v Speaker 1>sort of managing the motion of your body</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then once you get in it's almost </v>

3635
02:43:16.601 --> 02:43:19.600
<v Speaker 1>like a mantra.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You managing the motion of your body and</v>

3636
02:43:19.601 --> 02:43:22.360
<v Speaker 1>then the breathing and then once you get</v>
<v Speaker 1>it all sync up.</v>

3637
02:43:22.390 --> 02:43:26.710
<v Speaker 1>If you're in good enough shape that it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>not like a titanic struggle with every,</v>

3638
02:43:27.160 --> 02:43:27.993
<v Speaker 1>every lap or every stroke of your arms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can get into the sort of meditative </v>

3639
02:43:31.661 --> 02:43:34.180
<v Speaker 1>state that a lot of people achieve with </v>
<v Speaker 1>running or,</v>

3640
02:43:34.720 --> 02:43:35.553
<v Speaker 1>or even with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like sitting there and breathing </v>

3641
02:43:36.671 --> 02:43:40.090
<v Speaker 1>like a lot of people get that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a difficult time doing that,</v>

3642
02:43:40.091 --> 02:43:41.290
<v Speaker 1>but no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard.</v>

3643
02:43:41.630 --> 02:43:44.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it a funny.</v>

3644
02:43:44.510 --> 02:43:45.790
<v Speaker 1>That'd be hard to sit still.</v>

3645
02:43:46.010 --> 02:43:46.843
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is funny because actually like that </v>

3646
02:43:50.390 --> 02:43:52.340
<v Speaker 2>some of the other interesting stuff is </v>
<v Speaker 2>just doing that,</v>

3647
02:43:52.341 --> 02:43:53.174
<v Speaker 2>sit there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sit still and breathe changes like the </v>

3648
02:43:56.540 --> 02:43:58.790
<v Speaker 2>activation of enzymes and stuff like </v>
<v Speaker 2>telomerase.</v>

3649
02:43:58.820 --> 02:44:03.230
<v Speaker 2>The enzyme that rebuilds telomeres get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We literally activates telomerase so,</v>

3650
02:44:03.620 --> 02:44:06.470
<v Speaker 2>so fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How just like certain things like,</v>

3651
02:44:06.500 --> 02:44:09.680
<v Speaker 2>like I wouldn't imagine doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would it actually,</v>

3652
02:44:09.681 --> 02:44:11.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>changed telomerase</v>

3653
02:44:11.930 --> 02:44:14.360
<v Speaker 1>bodies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is never ending puzzle.</v>

3654
02:44:14.400 --> 02:44:15.233
<v Speaker 1>It really is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And whenever I talked to you a more and </v>

3655
02:44:16.941 --> 02:44:17.774
<v Speaker 1>more sort of aware of that because </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's so many different things in so </v>

3656
02:44:21.381 --> 02:44:22.214
<v Speaker 1>many different mechanisms and in terms </v>
<v Speaker 1>of nutrition and nutritional absorption </v>

3657
02:44:24.951 --> 02:44:27.290
<v Speaker 1>that I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm so ignorant of and it's.</v>

3658
02:44:27.291 --> 02:44:29.050
<v Speaker 1>I hear all these things and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to,</v>

3659
02:44:30.170 --> 02:44:34.610
<v Speaker 1>trying to get a map of the territory and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I make also,</v>

3660
02:44:34.611 --> 02:44:35.444
<v Speaker 1>there's so many things I'm injured,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I feel like every time I talk it's </v>

3661
02:44:39.081 --> 02:44:42.020
<v Speaker 1>like someone's breaking out a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>napkin and going,</v>

3662
02:44:42.021 --> 02:44:42.854
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you take a right here and you go </v>

<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

3664
02:44:45.350 --> 02:44:46.183
<v Speaker 1>but it's not a real map.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the map of the whole thing escapes </v>

3665
02:44:50.661 --> 02:44:52.220
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's too big.</v>

3666
02:44:52.330 --> 02:44:55.790
<v Speaker 1>It's too big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's too complex and I'll listen to this</v>

3667
02:44:55.791 --> 02:44:56.624
<v Speaker 1>podcast again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I'll listen to all the things you </v>

02:44:58.580 --> 02:45:01.670
<v Speaker 1>said again and I'll try to take notes </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe tomorrow or the next day,</v>

3669
02:45:02.080 --> 02:45:05.300
<v Speaker 1>but then my stupid brain will like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll like leak.</v>

3670
02:45:05.301 --> 02:45:09.080
<v Speaker 1>Half of it will leak out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like I'm trying to hold water in my</v>

3671
02:45:09.081 --> 02:45:10.970
<v Speaker 1>fingers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like I got it.</v>

<v Speaker 1>dripping down my wrists.</v>

3673
02:45:15.200 --> 02:45:17.580

<v Speaker 1>so hard to get a,</v>

3674
02:45:18.020 --> 02:45:19.790
<v Speaker 1>a real understanding of this stuff.</v>

3675
02:45:20.540 --> 02:45:21.490
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3676
02:45:21.510 --> 02:45:25.100
<v Speaker 2>certainly lots of controversy and </v>
<v Speaker 2>disagreement among researchers as well,</v>

3677
02:45:25.790 --> 02:45:26.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't you think</v>

3678
02:45:26.970 --> 02:45:27.803
<v Speaker 1>also probably one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's so attractive about simplifying </v>

3679
02:45:30.471 --> 02:45:33.650
<v Speaker 1>things like Hashtag meet heels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

<v Speaker 1>it into like one type of practice and </v>

02:45:39.651 --> 02:45:41.390
<v Speaker 1>that's all you need.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all you need.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I want to feel amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they jump into.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm glad you did get emotional and I'm </v>

3692

<v Speaker 1>hope I'm going to send this to Jordan </v>

3693
02:46:06.050 --> 02:46:06.883
<v Speaker 1>afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if he has the time to </v>

3694
02:46:07.461 --> 02:46:09.740
<v Speaker 1>listen to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He might have less than us,</v>

3695
02:46:10.160 --> 02:46:11.420
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>guys pretty busy.</v>

3696
02:46:11.660 --> 02:46:13.370

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3697
02:46:13.940 --> 02:46:16.490
<v Speaker 3>moving,</v>

3700
02:46:21.561 --> 02:46:25.490
<v Speaker 3>now and you've got to be real careful </v>
<v Speaker 3>about movements because you get swept up</v>

3701
02:46:25.491 --> 02:46:26.870
<v Speaker 3>in him and you're like,</v>
