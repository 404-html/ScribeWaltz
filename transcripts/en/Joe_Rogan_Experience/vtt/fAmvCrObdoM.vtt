<v Speaker 1>the muscle memories back and uh,</v>

14
00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.710
<v Speaker 1>I met a new camp that's great for my </v>
<v Speaker 1>style training with Rafael Lovato Jr uh,</v>

15
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.410
<v Speaker 1>maybe the best American grappler for </v>
<v Speaker 1>Bjj.</v>

16
00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:35.640
<v Speaker 1>Most accomplished,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe.</v>

17
00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:36.563
<v Speaker 1>He's fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're in Oklahoma is or where he's </v>

18
00:00:38.611 --> 00:00:39.444
<v Speaker 1>at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oklahoma just moved there and then </v>

19
00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.820
<v Speaker 1>December I moved there to train and </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting train alongside him.</v>

20
00:00:44.821 --> 00:00:47.880
<v Speaker 1>And that's also where water four is </v>
<v Speaker 1>headquartered out of Oklahoma City.</v>

21
00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.650
<v Speaker 1>How fucking convenient.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

22
00:00:49.651 --> 00:00:52.530
<v Speaker 1>So now I have the best of both worlds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My two passions right there.</v>

23
00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:54.690
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>May He's,</v>

24
00:00:54.691 --> 00:00:59.280
<v Speaker 1>he's really good ban.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rafael Lovato has that pressure style to</v>

25
00:00:59.281 --> 00:01:03.450
<v Speaker 1>that Solow Barrow smashing style.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very Fun to watch that guy.</v>

26
00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.313
<v Speaker 1>The only guy I've ever felt </v>
<v Speaker 1>claustrophobic underneath without a </v>

27
00:01:07.501 --> 00:01:08.580
<v Speaker 1>doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's just,</v>

28
00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.380
<v Speaker 1>I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't explain it.</v>

29
00:01:10.381 --> 00:01:12.000
<v Speaker 1>You just cannot get away that smash </v>
<v Speaker 1>pass,</v>

30
00:01:12.001 --> 00:01:12.834
<v Speaker 1>that pressure pass out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just melts into you and there's no </v>

31
00:01:15.241 --> 00:01:16.074
<v Speaker 1>escape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like he's melting and he's like </v>

32
00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:17.860
<v Speaker 1>glue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

33
00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.590
<v Speaker 1>Salo John G,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole,</v>

34
00:01:19.591 --> 00:01:22.380
<v Speaker 1>that whole family of that style of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu.</v>

35
00:01:22.381 --> 00:01:23.214
<v Speaker 1>So powerful man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've gotten to meet both of them now a </v>

36
00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:27.750
<v Speaker 1>train.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was Salo and then Shawn Gee was there</v>

37
00:01:27.751 --> 00:01:28.500
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

38
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.333
<v Speaker 1>our corner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was pretty awesome for a bill to </v>

39
00:01:30.661 --> 00:01:32.010
<v Speaker 1>our flight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was Kinda,</v>

40
00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.280
<v Speaker 1>I was Kinda bummed out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rafael Lovato,</v>

41
00:01:35.281 --> 00:01:38.220
<v Speaker 1>his last fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he stopped and with strikes I was like,</v>

42
00:01:38.221 --> 00:01:39.810
<v Speaker 1>God damn it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I kicked him in the head.</v>

43
00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:40.940
<v Speaker 1>13 seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

44
00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:41.701
<v Speaker 1>it was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

45
00:01:41.701 --> 00:01:44.040
<v Speaker 1>it's great to see him succeed and do </v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

46
00:01:44.041 --> 00:01:45.810
<v Speaker 1>but I wanted to see his Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

47
00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.700
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just getting the wheel.</v>

48
00:01:47.701 --> 00:01:49.180
<v Speaker 1>But he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

49
00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:50.100
<v Speaker 1>he's an animal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Honestly.</v>

50
00:01:50.101 --> 00:01:52.260
<v Speaker 1>He's one of those guys that is so well </v>
<v Speaker 1>rounded.</v>

51
00:01:52.261 --> 00:01:54.450
<v Speaker 1>And you think he's just one dimensional,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

52
00:01:54.451 --> 00:01:56.100
<v Speaker 1>because of everything he's done in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu,</v>

53
00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.650
<v Speaker 1>but he grew up kickboxing doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

54
00:01:58.651 --> 00:02:00.600

<v Speaker 1>not just Jujitsu his whole life.</v>

<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

59
00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.140

60
00:02:13.141 --> 00:02:15.090
<v Speaker 1>so we fought back to back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He fought right before me.</v>

61

<v Speaker 1>now they have a legit state,</v>

68
00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.720

69
00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:35.610

<v Speaker 1>And now fade or very interesting.</v>

72
00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.823
<v Speaker 1>What did you think about the fade or </v>
<v Speaker 1>mitre own thing where they had to pull </v>

73
00:02:46.231 --> 00:02:47.064
<v Speaker 1>out like Mitchell and had to pull out </v>
<v Speaker 1>because of his kidney stone and then </v>

74
00:02:49.891 --> 00:02:53.370
<v Speaker 1>they're going to schedule it again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apparently Madison Square Gardens.</v>

75
00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:54.263
<v Speaker 1>So June's paper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>paper view first one for Bella tour or </v>

76
00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:57.633
<v Speaker 1>if he was tough man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's tough to get people to buy </v>

77
00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:00.310
<v Speaker 1>something they've been getting for free.</v>

78
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:01.570
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

79
00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.480
<v Speaker 2>but I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think this card there,</v>

80
00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:06.420
<v Speaker 2>they're stacking it pretty heavily </v>
<v Speaker 2>versus vanderbilt,</v>

81
00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.700
<v Speaker 2>which that's where Rafael has been going</v>
<v Speaker 2>down into,</v>

82
00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:11.330
<v Speaker 2>I forget to say it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but cure tb.</v>

83
00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:12.873
<v Speaker 2>Brazil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

84
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.833
<v Speaker 2>Down there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And was sparring with vander before his </v>

85
00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:19.120
<v Speaker 2>fight is a fight apparently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

86
00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.240
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He sent me a meme of something like,</v>

87
00:03:22.241 --> 00:03:23.950
<v Speaker 2>let's train easy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

88
00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.000
<v Speaker 2>and then releasing like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

89
00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:28.660
<v Speaker 2>train easy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's that picture of him and a pride</v>

90
00:03:28.661 --> 00:03:29.494
<v Speaker 2>or something or maybe training where </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's jumping in the air and he's just </v>

91
00:03:31.361 --> 00:03:34.180
<v Speaker 2>coming down with a big hammer fist and </v>
<v Speaker 2>gonna land on you with his feet.</v>

92
00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.690
<v Speaker 2>That's a light day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's kind of known for that.</v>

93
00:03:37.691 --> 00:03:39.760
<v Speaker 2>Just being a barbarian 24,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seven.</v>

94
00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's why he's so fun to watch.</v>

95
00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:46.020
<v Speaker 2>And I think what you said and just asked</v>
<v Speaker 2>about what did I think between fader and</v>

96
00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.160
<v Speaker 2>Matt Mitrione when they had to pull out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

97
00:03:48.161 --> 00:03:50.810
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I flashed back right away to,</v>

98
00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:51.683
<v Speaker 2>do you remember whenever Stephan struve </v>
<v Speaker 2>had to pull out of his fight with Mitch </v>

99
00:03:54.971 --> 00:03:59.440
<v Speaker 2>reone backstage and they were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was like blacking out or something,</v>

100
00:03:59.441 --> 00:03:59.610
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

101
00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:00.443
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a serious pastiche a couple of </v>

102
00:04:01.021 --> 00:04:01.854
<v Speaker 2>times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he was having that heart problem as </v>

103
00:04:02.891 --> 00:04:03.724
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

104
00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:06.160
<v Speaker 2>but Mitch Rune was back there all gloved</v>
<v Speaker 2>up,</v>

105
00:04:06.161 --> 00:04:07.930
<v Speaker 2>already taped up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>had his gloves on,</v>

106
00:04:07.931 --> 00:04:08.764
<v Speaker 2>was hitting Mitts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then there were some of the behind </v>

107
00:04:10.271 --> 00:04:11.104
<v Speaker 2>the scenes cameras that caught a moment </v>
<v Speaker 2>where I believe it was Dana coming back </v>

108
00:04:14.051 --> 00:04:14.884
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tell him the fight was canceled and </v>

109
00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:17.680
<v Speaker 2>Mitroville and just was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

110
00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:19.300
<v Speaker 2>cussing up a storm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No Way.</v>

111
00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:20.290
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not at all.</v>

112
00:04:20.291 --> 00:04:21.124
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then all of a sudden you saw it </v>

113
00:04:21.921 --> 00:04:25.540
<v Speaker 2>shift where all of a sudden he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>worried about Stephan and he walked down</v>

114
00:04:25.541 --> 00:04:28.940
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>went backstage or to his locker room and</v>

115
00:04:28.941 --> 00:04:29.774
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he just hugged him and Stephan was </v>

116
00:04:30.221 --> 00:04:32.710
<v Speaker 2>sobbing and Matt Mitrione was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

117
00:04:32.711 --> 00:04:33.670
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all right bro.</v>

118
00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:36.250
<v Speaker 2>I know if you could fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would have and all the other stuff.</v>

119
00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:39.520
<v Speaker 2>And so I guess he had passed at least </v>
<v Speaker 2>one or two kidney stones,</v>

120
00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:42.950
<v Speaker 2>the fight week,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a couple days before wins.</v>

121
00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:44.043
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then the day of the fight they just </v>

122
00:04:45.401 --> 00:04:46.234
<v Speaker 2>started coming back out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he had something like 15 or 20 </v>

123
00:04:48.151 --> 00:04:49.570
<v Speaker 2>times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So man,</v>

124
00:04:49.571 --> 00:04:51.620
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know all the ladies out there you are,</v>

125
00:04:51.621 --> 00:04:52.980
<v Speaker 2>you're a lot tougher than us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

126
00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:55.150
<v Speaker 2>giving birth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I hear this is the equivalent,</v>

127
00:04:55.151 --> 00:04:55.901
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the men,</v>

128
00:04:55.901 --> 00:04:57.790
<v Speaker 2>it's passed out any stone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I doubt it.</v>

129
00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:58.683
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's be like more like passing a </v>

130
00:04:59.831 --> 00:05:02.800
<v Speaker 2>marble three your call,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

131
00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:06.100
<v Speaker 2>maybe even a golf ball.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems like it's not even close.</v>

132
00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:07.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it probably hurts.</v>

133
00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:08.530
<v Speaker 2>It sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

134
00:05:08.531 --> 00:05:10.210
<v Speaker 2>it does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that 15 or 20 of them,</v>

135
00:05:10.211 --> 00:05:13.030
<v Speaker 2>something like that and that would be </v>
<v Speaker 2>brutal instead of just one or two.</v>

136
00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:16.120
<v Speaker 2>They are a side effect of weight cutting</v>
<v Speaker 2>for a lot of people.</v>

137
00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.630
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I know Aldo had one and a,</v>

138
00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:22.280
<v Speaker 2>I think some other fighters have had </v>
<v Speaker 2>them too and I think it has to do,</v>

139
00:05:22.281 --> 00:05:24.850
<v Speaker 2>there's some sort of connection with </v>
<v Speaker 2>massive dehydration,</v>

140
00:05:24.851 --> 00:05:26.530
<v Speaker 2>which I'm sure Matt doesn't have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>worry about,</v>

141
00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:28.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fighting heavyweight.</v>

142
00:05:28.691 --> 00:05:29.950
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't have to cut the weight like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

143
00:05:29.951 --> 00:05:31.720
<v Speaker 2>So I wonder what what caused his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

144
00:05:31.721 --> 00:05:32.441
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

145
00:05:32.441 --> 00:05:33.274
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you're putting some your kidneys </v>

146
00:05:34.241 --> 00:05:35.620
<v Speaker 2>through so much when you're cutting </v>
<v Speaker 2>weight,</v>

147
00:05:35.621 --> 00:05:38.600
<v Speaker 2>especially those extreme weight cuts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

148
00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:40.580
<v Speaker 2>I'm lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a heavy weight,</v>

149
00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:42.610
<v Speaker 2>very fortunate dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck all that man.</v>

150
00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:44.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what do you walk around at?</v>

151
00:05:44.541 --> 00:05:46.090
<v Speaker 2>Like what's your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're in shape,</v>

152
00:05:46.091 --> 00:05:50.440
<v Speaker 2>like you're in shape right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I weigh two 48 that's a good size man.</v>

153
00:05:50.441 --> 00:05:53.710
<v Speaker 2>Right to 45 don't you think they think </v>
<v Speaker 2>that that to 40 numbers,</v>

154
00:05:53.711 --> 00:05:56.540
<v Speaker 2>like the right number for heavyweights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They feel like not,</v>

155
00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:58.130
<v Speaker 2>I don't know who they are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was just talking</v>

156
00:05:58.130 --> 00:05:58.790
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

157
00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:59.990
<v Speaker 1>They think that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

158
00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:00.913
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the conventional wisdom is when you get </v>

159
00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:06.410
<v Speaker 1>into to sixties and above and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like above two 50 that there's,</v>

160
00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:08.410
<v Speaker 1>there's a point of diminishing returns </v>
<v Speaker 1>where you're,</v>

161
00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:12.710
<v Speaker 1>you're carrying around so much mass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't really perform as well.</v>

162
00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:13.763
<v Speaker 1>But a 240 pound guy is so big and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>strong that you can handle a 265 pound </v>

163
00:06:18.951 --> 00:06:19.784
<v Speaker 1>guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you have more endurance and it's </v>

164
00:06:20.661 --> 00:06:22.170
<v Speaker 1>just a better wait.</v>

165
00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:23.910
<v Speaker 2>I totally agree with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

166
00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:26.220
<v Speaker 2>when I was living at the Olympic </v>
<v Speaker 2>training center in wrestling there,</v>

167
00:06:26.221 --> 00:06:31.221
<v Speaker 2>the weight class was to 64.5 or 120 </v>
<v Speaker 2>kilos and we always try to stay above it</v>

168
00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:34.920
<v Speaker 2>and then cut for the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to make weight because wrestling,</v>

169
00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:36.810
<v Speaker 2>I mean being the single sport or </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrestling,</v>

170
00:06:36.811 --> 00:06:39.270
<v Speaker 2>like you need that weight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's only six minute match.</v>

171
00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:41.870
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then the new Greco Roman rules,</v>

172
00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:44.760
<v Speaker 2>I mean you get three breaks in between a</v>
<v Speaker 2>two period round.</v>

173
00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:47.310
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so you're getting that weight.</v>

174
00:06:47.311 --> 00:06:48.144
<v Speaker 2>You need it to throw the guy around when</v>
<v Speaker 2>it comes to them and May and you're </v>

175
00:06:50.131 --> 00:06:50.964
<v Speaker 2>adding in that Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is anaerobic and aerobic strength </v>

176
00:06:53.761 --> 00:06:55.830
<v Speaker 2>and cardio and everything else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You need it all.</v>

177
00:06:55.831 --> 00:06:56.730
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

178
00:06:56.731 --> 00:06:58.830
<v Speaker 2>my first two fights back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was coming in heavier,</v>

179
00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:01.950
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in men to drop a little bit.</v>

180
00:07:01.951 --> 00:07:03.600
<v Speaker 2>I felt a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot better.</v>

181
00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:05.550
<v Speaker 2>My conditioning was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was on point.</v>

182
00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:07.680
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't rushing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd put in the time,</v>

183
00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:10.020
<v Speaker 2>the effort and everything else and get </v>
<v Speaker 2>my cardio good.</v>

184
00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:13.630
<v Speaker 2>My Diet really Rafael's got an awesome </v>
<v Speaker 2>strength coach.</v>

185
00:07:13.631 --> 00:07:17.560
<v Speaker 2>His name is Lucia is tyree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now he's my guy named from green strings</v>

186
00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:18.743
<v Speaker 2>and man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he just got us on this warrior kind of </v>

187
00:07:19.951 --> 00:07:20.784
<v Speaker 2>lifestyle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not about a program or fight camp </v>

188
00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:25.260
<v Speaker 2>and you getting ready then it's about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

189
00:07:25.261 --> 00:07:27.840
<v Speaker 2>let's just live this in day in and day </v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

190
00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:29.520
<v Speaker 2>Eat the right food,</v>
<v Speaker 2>real food,</v>

191
00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:32.490
<v Speaker 2>put real nutrition in your body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Real strength,</v>

192
00:07:32.491 --> 00:07:33.660
<v Speaker 2>kind of like the honest stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

193
00:07:33.661 --> 00:07:34.950
<v Speaker 2>the kettle bells,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything else.</v>

194
00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:37.020
<v Speaker 2>And I had never done that before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

195
00:07:37.021 --> 00:07:37.854
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this was a real shift in my training </v>

196
00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:39.600
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

197
00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:40.220
<v Speaker 2>it paid off.</v>

198
00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:42.170
<v Speaker 1>So he works with your nutrition as well?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

199
00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.300
<v Speaker 1>And what kind of changes that he made </v>
<v Speaker 1>for that</v>

200
00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:45.381
<v Speaker 2>man?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

201
00:07:45.381 --> 00:07:46.880
<v Speaker 2>for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that,</v>

202
00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:48.830
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's about maturing too.</v>

203
00:07:48.831 --> 00:07:50.600
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the five years I took off,</v>

204
00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:51.493
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and before that I was 19 fighting </v>

205
00:07:53.001 --> 00:07:55.040
<v Speaker 2>professionally until I was 23,</v>
<v Speaker 2>24.</v>

206
00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:56.930
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I was young and dumb.</v>

207
00:07:56.931 --> 00:07:58.760
<v Speaker 2>I was tilt with addictions and </v>
<v Speaker 2>depression,</v>

208
00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:00.030
<v Speaker 2>other stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Man,</v>

209
00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:00.883
<v Speaker 2>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would tighten everything up during </v>

210
00:08:02.511 --> 00:08:04.310
<v Speaker 2>fight camp,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but before a fight coming up,</v>

211
00:08:04.311 --> 00:08:05.840
<v Speaker 2>I'd eat whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

212
00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:08.060
<v Speaker 2>and this has just been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

213
00:08:08.061 --> 00:08:11.090
<v Speaker 2>having just tons of salads,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

214
00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:12.770
<v Speaker 2>eating meat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>veggies,</v>

215
00:08:12.771 --> 00:08:15.620
<v Speaker 2>fruits,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just fueling your body constantly.</v>

216
00:08:15.910 --> 00:08:17.600
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so that's just been something really</v>

217
00:08:17.601 --> 00:08:18.080
<v Speaker 2>good for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

218
00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:20.030
<v Speaker 2>I have CELIAC,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I can't eat the breads,</v>

219
00:08:20.031 --> 00:08:21.320
<v Speaker 2>the grains.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

220
00:08:21.321 --> 00:08:22.280
<v Speaker 2>I can't eat wheat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>barley,</v>

221
00:08:22.281 --> 00:08:23.680
<v Speaker 2>rye,</v>
<v Speaker 2>huge guy to have celiacs.</v>

222
00:08:23.690 --> 00:08:25.520
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what did they find out when you were</v>

223
00:08:25.521 --> 00:08:26.540
<v Speaker 2>really young?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

224
00:08:26.541 --> 00:08:27.530
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

225
00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:28.423
<v Speaker 2>I found out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I had gone through the opiate </v>

226
00:08:30.391 --> 00:08:34.190
<v Speaker 2>addictions and at six years of that that</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had an ulcer in my stomach.</v>

227
00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:35.540
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

228
00:08:35.541 --> 00:08:38.060
<v Speaker 2>but I noticed that during that time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anytime I would eat wheat,</v>

229
00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:41.960
<v Speaker 2>wheat bread with breakfast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I would get a nauseous.</v>

230
00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:42.893
<v Speaker 2>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

231
00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:44.023
<v Speaker 2>I would</v>

232
00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:45.060
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

233
00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:49.020
<v Speaker 1>So did you have it before or did you get</v>
<v Speaker 1>it because of the ulcer?</v>

234
00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:50.273
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that probably triggered </v>

235
00:08:51.241 --> 00:08:52.160
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

236
00:08:52.170 --> 00:08:53.460
<v Speaker 2>the opiate addiction and everything </v>
<v Speaker 2>else.</v>

237
00:08:53.461 --> 00:08:56.850
<v Speaker 2>Then when I went to Congo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it really got bad and I didn't know what</v>

238
00:08:56.851 --> 00:08:58.410
<v Speaker 2>it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then whenever I got back,</v>

239
00:08:58.411 --> 00:09:01.680
<v Speaker 2>I mean having the malaria three times </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't gay fever,</v>

240
00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:03.780
<v Speaker 2>blackwater fever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

241
00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:06.390
<v Speaker 2>all sorts of intestinal parasites and </v>
<v Speaker 2>bacteria is,</v>

242
00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:07.770
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I got back here,</v>

243
00:09:07.771 --> 00:09:08.604
<v Speaker 2>I was just wrecked in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So my doctor did some tests on me and I </v>

244
00:09:10.231 --> 00:09:10.621
<v Speaker 2>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

245
00:09:10.621 --> 00:09:11.454
<v Speaker 2>you have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you weren't just any more gluten </v>

246
00:09:13.301 --> 00:09:14.134
<v Speaker 2>intolerant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you have full blown Celiac and here </v>

247
00:09:15.571 --> 00:09:19.020
<v Speaker 2>at the top of the chart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you used to be gluten intolerant?</v>

248
00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:19.973
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then it became celiac top of the </v>

249
00:09:21.571 --> 00:09:23.610
<v Speaker 2>charts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now do you think anything has connection</v>

250
00:09:23.611 --> 00:09:24.444
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for people who have never heard of you </v>

251
00:09:25.681 --> 00:09:28.980
<v Speaker 2>before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you live in the Congo for long stretches</v>

252
00:09:28.981 --> 00:09:32.100
<v Speaker 2>of time working with the pygmies and </v>
<v Speaker 2>digging wells and you've caught malaria,</v>

253
00:09:32.101 --> 00:09:32.934
<v Speaker 2>they're on two separate occasions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you've got it three times cause it </v>

254
00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:36.210
<v Speaker 2>reoccurred on you.</v>

255
00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:37.043
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that that might have </v>

256
00:09:38.311 --> 00:09:41.880
<v Speaker 2>compromised your immune system and </v>
<v Speaker 2>contributed to this CELIAC's disease?</v>

257
00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:43.260
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They say about that.</v>

258
00:09:43.270 --> 00:09:46.110
<v Speaker 2>My immune system was just shot and so </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's been,</v>

259
00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:48.450
<v Speaker 2>I mean so the five,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean before that,</v>

260
00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:50.340
<v Speaker 2>the drug addictions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that took a toll on my body.</v>

261
00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:52.440
<v Speaker 2>Then going to the Congo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>having the malaria,</v>

262
00:09:52.441 --> 00:09:54.030
<v Speaker 2>having other things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

263
00:09:54.130 --> 00:09:57.060
<v Speaker 2>it's wrecked my body and so now over the</v>
<v Speaker 2>last three years,</v>

264
00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:58.013
<v Speaker 2>and that's why I am so thankful for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy like Raphael modeling how to live </v>

265
00:10:00.721 --> 00:10:01.554
<v Speaker 2>this lifestyle just day in and day out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lucius there to guide us because I </v>

266
00:10:06.031 --> 00:10:06.864
<v Speaker 2>needed that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really needed to rebuild my health </v>

267
00:10:08.490 --> 00:10:09.840
<v Speaker 2>from the ground up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

268
00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:11.243
<v Speaker 2>And to stay consistent with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like when the fights over maybe </v>

269
00:10:13.651 --> 00:10:16.680
<v Speaker 2>indulge for like one meal but then get </v>
<v Speaker 2>right back on the grind.</v>

270
00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:18.960
<v Speaker 2>And so it's been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

271
00:10:18.961 --> 00:10:19.794
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really great for me to live it out and </v>

272
00:10:20.881 --> 00:10:22.140

<v Speaker 2>I dunno,</v>

273
00:10:22.170 --> 00:10:23.850
<v Speaker 2>just felt like I'm finally healthy </v>
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>

<v Speaker 2>That's awesome man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's amazing.</v>

<v Speaker 2>years off and essentially not even </v>

276
00:10:28.861 --> 00:10:30.660
<v Speaker 2>working out at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now,</v>

277
00:10:30.690 --> 00:10:31.523
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I appreciate that.</v>

282
00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:40.120
<v Speaker 2>Now when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you say that you have celiacs,</v>

283
00:10:40.121 --> 00:10:42.090
<v Speaker 2>so they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're adjusting your diet accordingly.</v>

284
00:10:42.091 --> 00:10:42.924
<v Speaker 2>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm really big into like fat based </v>

285
00:10:45.631 --> 00:10:48.390
<v Speaker 2>diets these days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you doing something like that or are</v>

286
00:10:48.391 --> 00:10:51.300
<v Speaker 2>you on a different kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>carbohydrates?</v>

287
00:10:51.301 --> 00:10:52.150
<v Speaker 2>Like how you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

288
00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:54.930
<v Speaker 2>how are they monitoring it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm definitely getting a lot more,</v>

289
00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:55.823
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot more like coconut oils and the </v>

290
00:10:57.931 --> 00:10:58.764
<v Speaker 2>grass fed butters and all of that too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to have a high fat content with every </v>

291
00:11:02.311 --> 00:11:03.150
<v Speaker 2>single meal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>breakfast,</v>

292
00:11:03.151 --> 00:11:03.711
<v Speaker 2>lunch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and dinner.</v>

293
00:11:03.711 --> 00:11:05.670
<v Speaker 2>I was still dropping weight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that,</v>

294
00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:06.593
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is kind of all new for me </v>
<v Speaker 2>where it's like me and I'm getting in a </v>

295
00:11:09.391 --> 00:11:11.010
<v Speaker 2>lot of fruits,</v>
<v Speaker 2>veggies,</v>

296
00:11:11.011 --> 00:11:13.980
<v Speaker 2>carbs and mostly fats,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fats and proteins.</v>

297
00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:16.650
<v Speaker 2>Then fruits and vegetables.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then probably carbs.</v>

298
00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:20.850
<v Speaker 2>Carbs are in fruits and vegetables,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but sort of they plan your meals out for</v>

299
00:11:20.851 --> 00:11:22.200
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you have like one of those?</v>

300
00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:23.093
<v Speaker 2>I have a meal prep place and a Okc </v>
<v Speaker 2>provision kitchen and it's pretty </v>

301
00:11:26.791 --> 00:11:28.110
<v Speaker 2>awesome because they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

302
00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:30.660
<v Speaker 2>they have their own farm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything's organic,</v>

303
00:11:30.661 --> 00:11:33.140
<v Speaker 2>locally grown.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so yeah,</v>

304
00:11:33.141 --> 00:11:35.760
<v Speaker 2>I just go in there and they're able to </v>
<v Speaker 2>help me out in Luke,</v>

305
00:11:35.761 --> 00:11:39.240
<v Speaker 2>works with them and Lucius helps me know</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I need to tell them to eat.</v>

306
00:11:39.241 --> 00:11:41.460
<v Speaker 2>And so it's just for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

307
00:11:41.461 --> 00:11:42.121
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

308
00:11:42.121 --> 00:11:43.530
<v Speaker 2>being a heavyweight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

309
00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:47.040
<v Speaker 2>a lot of times we haven't had to take a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a diet too strict.</v>

310
00:11:47.610 --> 00:11:49.350
<v Speaker 2>And other times I would during fight </v>
<v Speaker 2>camp,</v>

311
00:11:49.351 --> 00:11:50.184
<v Speaker 2>but I would just do what I thought was </v>
<v Speaker 2>right and what was fueling my body was </v>

312
00:11:53.411 --> 00:11:55.380
<v Speaker 2>feeling and performance for performance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

313
00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:57.910
<v Speaker 2>But now it's just like all around health</v>
<v Speaker 2>and performance.</v>

314
00:11:57.911 --> 00:11:59.410
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need to perform like a machine,</v>

315
00:11:59.411 --> 00:12:00.880
<v Speaker 2>like a professional athlete.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need,</v>

316
00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:02.163
<v Speaker 2>I need to fuel my body like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so having this team of people that </v>

317
00:12:04.541 --> 00:12:05.374
<v Speaker 2>are around and I think that's why the </v>
<v Speaker 2>move to Oklahoma City before coming </v>

318
00:12:08.501 --> 00:12:09.790
<v Speaker 2>back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>having the five years off,</v>

319
00:12:09.791 --> 00:12:10.624
<v Speaker 2>then come in and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being a Dallas Fort Worth and trying to </v>

320
00:12:12.371 --> 00:12:13.930
<v Speaker 2>rush back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then moving to Colorado,</v>

321
00:12:13.931 --> 00:12:16.900
<v Speaker 2>trying to get the camp there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>train at six or seven different gyms,</v>

322
00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:18.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cross train.</v>

323
00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:19.233
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't really all clicking but now </v>

324
00:12:20.651 --> 00:12:22.900
<v Speaker 2>being in Oklahoma City,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's water right there.</v>

325
00:12:23.070 --> 00:12:23.903
<v Speaker 2>There's Raphael's team,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which he has a worldclass guys all </v>

326
00:12:25.361 --> 00:12:26.194
<v Speaker 2>around him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got the nutritionist and the right </v>

327
00:12:28.091 --> 00:12:28.924
<v Speaker 2>restaurants and places have in place to </v>
<v Speaker 2>where now I can just focus on training </v>

328
00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:35.020
<v Speaker 2>and then I get to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the meantime their break time,</v>

329
00:12:35.021 --> 00:12:36.850
<v Speaker 2>I get to share the story of why I'm back</v>
<v Speaker 2>to fighting.</v>

330
00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:39.550
<v Speaker 2>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now this a meal prep place,</v>

331
00:12:39.551 --> 00:12:40.980
<v Speaker 2>do you give them like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

332
00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:42.880
<v Speaker 2>I would like my food to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

333
00:12:42.881 --> 00:12:46.900
<v Speaker 2>75% this 25% that this is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>carbohydrate quantity.</v>

334
00:12:46.901 --> 00:12:48.790
<v Speaker 2>I'm looking forward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the amount of protein.</v>

335
00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:53.320
<v Speaker 2>So how to calories basically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I don't know exactly,</v>

336
00:12:53.410 --> 00:12:54.243
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need to have a better like input into </v>

337
00:12:56.501 --> 00:12:57.101
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But man,</v>

338
00:12:57.101 --> 00:12:59.590
<v Speaker 2>they've just really said this is what he</v>
<v Speaker 2>needs here in fight camp.</v>

339
00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:03.760
<v Speaker 2>And then I was focused on training and </v>
<v Speaker 2>so it was really good though because I'm</v>

340
00:13:03.761 --> 00:13:04.660
<v Speaker 2>getting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

341
00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:06.273
<v Speaker 2>a bunch of coconut oil and Avocados and </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything else all throughout the day </v>

342
00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:11.080
<v Speaker 2>to make sure I'm having a high fat </v>
<v Speaker 2>content.</v>

343
00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:13.870
<v Speaker 2>And how many times do you eat in a day?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Three to five,</v>

344
00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:15.550
<v Speaker 2>three big meals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If,</v>

345
00:13:15.551 --> 00:13:16.920
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I'm not able,</v>

346
00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:20.380
<v Speaker 2>if I'm just swamped and busy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then if I have time to make sure I'm</v>

347
00:13:20.381 --> 00:13:21.760
<v Speaker 2>feeling about him eating five meals.</v>

348
00:13:21.850 --> 00:13:25.030
<v Speaker 2>So are you working out twice a day or </v>
<v Speaker 2>like how you two to three times a day?</v>

<v Speaker 2>Damn.</v>

351
00:13:27.610 --> 00:13:29.210
<v Speaker 2>So back in the heat of things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

352
00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:32.170
<v Speaker 2>hundred percent Rafael's a machine </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to keep up with him,</v>

353
00:13:32.171 --> 00:13:34.170
<v Speaker 2>but feeding off that energy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

354
00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:35.320
<v Speaker 2>it's been really great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

355
00:13:35.321 --> 00:13:36.154
<v Speaker 2>cause it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been around a lot of guys in the </v>

356
00:13:37.781 --> 00:13:39.060
<v Speaker 2>sport and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

357
00:13:39.070 --> 00:13:41.230
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even expect to talk this much </v>
<v Speaker 2>about him,</v>

358
00:13:41.231 --> 00:13:42.970
<v Speaker 2>but it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's been really encouraging.</v>

359
00:13:42.971 --> 00:13:44.440
<v Speaker 2>I've been around Kenny Monday,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kendall Cross,</v>

360
00:13:44.441 --> 00:13:47.530
<v Speaker 2>Cael Sanderson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all these Olympic gold medalist and it's</v>

361
00:13:47.531 --> 00:13:49.360
<v Speaker 2>been great cause they were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my coach is pouring into me.</v>

362
00:13:49.510 --> 00:13:52.180
<v Speaker 2>But here's a guy that's the best at his </v>
<v Speaker 2>craft.</v>

363
00:13:52.210 --> 00:13:54.220
<v Speaker 2>That's Worldclass,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's world champ.</v>

364
00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:58.360
<v Speaker 2>And he's completely obsessed with every </v>
<v Speaker 2>aspect of MMA.</v>

365
00:13:58.570 --> 00:13:59.403
<v Speaker 2>And being able to see that and feed off </v>
<v Speaker 2>of it has been incredibly encouraging </v>

366
00:14:02.351 --> 00:14:02.590
<v Speaker 2>for me.</v>

367
00:14:02.590 --> 00:14:04.090
<v Speaker 2>So him and I both were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>

368
00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:06.310
<v Speaker 2>like the stars are aligning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is destiny.</v>

369
00:14:06.311 --> 00:14:07.144
<v Speaker 2>You and me both.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to go get those Bella tore </v>

370
00:14:08.501 --> 00:14:09.550
<v Speaker 2>straps,</v>
<v Speaker 2>world champs.</v>

371
00:14:09.850 --> 00:14:11.890
<v Speaker 2>Let's do that first unless do that </v>
<v Speaker 2>quick.</v>

372
00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:13.290
<v Speaker 2>What does he weigh?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Many,</v>

373
00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:16.990
<v Speaker 2>he walks around it probably to 10 to 15 </v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe to 20.</v>

374
00:14:17.050 --> 00:14:19.690
<v Speaker 2>And what's he finding a man?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He cuts all the way down to one 85.</v>

375
00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:23.110
<v Speaker 2>So he's the biggest one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>85 were I've ever trained,</v>

376
00:14:23.111 --> 00:14:25.510
<v Speaker 2>was crying and he feels like he's 400 </v>
<v Speaker 2>men.</v>

377
00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:26.373
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brendan and I were just talking about </v>

378
00:14:27.071 --> 00:14:28.630
<v Speaker 2>this yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

379
00:14:28.810 --> 00:14:29.643
<v Speaker 2>but being under Shane Carwyn and worst </v>
<v Speaker 2>case scenario where he's having you </v>

380
00:14:32.721 --> 00:14:34.180
<v Speaker 2>mounted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it just,</v>

381
00:14:34.390 --> 00:14:35.980
<v Speaker 2>Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you hated life,</v>

382
00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:38.450
<v Speaker 2>big Shane on your shore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

383
00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:41.110
<v Speaker 2>but there's something so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

384
00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:42.333
<v Speaker 2>demoralizing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then at the same time encouraging </v>

385
00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:48.640
<v Speaker 2>because a raphael is doing that and </v>
<v Speaker 2>making you feel claustrophobic,</v>

386
00:14:48.641 --> 00:14:51.310
<v Speaker 2>like a 400 pound gorillas on top of you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

387
00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:52.760
<v Speaker 2>or 600 pound whatever.</v>

388
00:14:53.090 --> 00:14:55.240
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's also coaching you,</v>

389
00:14:55.250 --> 00:14:57.320
<v Speaker 2>telling you how you can do that to </v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody else.</v>

390
00:14:57.700 --> 00:14:58.880
<v Speaker 2>And so at the end of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

391
00:14:58.881 --> 00:14:59.714
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's shown you how to do exactly what </v>

392
00:15:00.531 --> 00:15:01.364
<v Speaker 2>he's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he's a fantastic coach and you don't </v>

393
00:15:02.961 --> 00:15:05.230
<v Speaker 2>always see that from the best athletes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

394
00:15:05.810 --> 00:15:09.770
<v Speaker 2>sometimes they're incredibly talented </v>
<v Speaker 2>and great at their craft,</v>

395
00:15:09.771 --> 00:15:10.790
<v Speaker 2>but explaining it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

396
00:15:10.791 --> 00:15:11.624
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now explain it to me again or show me </v>

397
00:15:12.411 --> 00:15:14.240
<v Speaker 2>how to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like here I'm showing you like,</v>

398
00:15:14.241 --> 00:15:15.290
<v Speaker 2>just watch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

399
00:15:15.650 --> 00:15:17.870
<v Speaker 2>But he can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he can tell you every little detail,</v>

400
00:15:17.871 --> 00:15:18.704
<v Speaker 2>every little inch.</v>

401
00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:19.713
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's probably has a lot to do with a </v>

402
00:15:21.281 --> 00:15:23.320
<v Speaker 1>solow who barrow lineage too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

403
00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:26.200
<v Speaker 1>that's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very technical school and they're really</v>

404
00:15:26.201 --> 00:15:27.034
<v Speaker 1>involved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Solid is really involved in the history </v>

405
00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:31.990
<v Speaker 1>of all the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the different techniques and you know,</v>

406
00:15:31.991 --> 00:15:32.824
<v Speaker 1>where they came from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now why did he move to Oklahoma </v>

407
00:15:34.961 --> 00:15:36.340
<v Speaker 1>City?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is he down there?</v>

408
00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:37.930
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually,</v>

409
00:15:37.931 --> 00:15:40.270
<v Speaker 2>that's where he's from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think whenever he was like six,</v>

410
00:15:40.271 --> 00:15:41.140
<v Speaker 2>seven,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eight years old,</v>

411
00:15:41.141 --> 00:15:42.950
<v Speaker 2>he moved from Chicago there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

412
00:15:43.180 --> 00:15:45.550
<v Speaker 2>I watched a documentary on flow </v>
<v Speaker 2>grappling.</v>

413
00:15:45.551 --> 00:15:49.150
<v Speaker 2>That's how I even got Ahold of Rafael is</v>
<v Speaker 2>knew I was moving to Oklahoma City.</v>

414
00:15:49.151 --> 00:15:51.370
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's there to train with a moving there</v>

415
00:15:51.371 --> 00:15:52.960
<v Speaker 2>for water for and fight for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>forgotten.</v>

416
00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:54.173
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I saw that documentary incredibly </v>

417
00:15:55.361 --> 00:15:56.194
<v Speaker 2>inspirational shows the whole lineage of</v>
<v Speaker 2>whom trained with Sahlu and Shawn g and </v>

418
00:15:58.991 --> 00:16:00.760
<v Speaker 2>how he went to Brazil to train with </v>
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>

419
00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:02.830
<v Speaker 2>live with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they came up to Toledo,</v>

420
00:16:02.831 --> 00:16:03.820
<v Speaker 2>Ohio.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At first.</v>

421
00:16:04.060 --> 00:16:04.893
<v Speaker 2>He went there and they were living in </v>
<v Speaker 2>basically like this little apartment </v>

422
00:16:07.631 --> 00:16:10.690
<v Speaker 2>that was freezing inside and the Toledo </v>
<v Speaker 2>a winters.</v>

423
00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:11.673
<v Speaker 2>And they're having to put their gies </v>
<v Speaker 2>over the heater to try to warm him up </v>

424
00:16:13.541 --> 00:16:16.060
<v Speaker 2>after every training session to get back</v>
<v Speaker 2>in there and do it again.</v>

425
00:16:16.390 --> 00:16:17.223
<v Speaker 2>And that's some of their best training </v>
<v Speaker 2>matches were in the living room on the </v>

426
00:16:19.931 --> 00:16:22.000
<v Speaker 2>mat that they would throw out there </v>
<v Speaker 2>right in front of the couch.</v>

427
00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:24.070
<v Speaker 2>And so it was just cool to see how these</v>
<v Speaker 2>guys,</v>

428
00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:24.913
<v Speaker 2>where they were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where they came from and what they've </v>

429
00:16:26.891 --> 00:16:28.840
<v Speaker 2>done now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like truly for me,</v>

430
00:16:28.841 --> 00:16:30.310
<v Speaker 2>inspiring cause that's what I want to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

431
00:16:30.510 --> 00:16:32.220
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's the best way to do it,</v>

432
00:16:32.221 --> 00:16:33.054
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To just be with the elite of the elite </v>

433
00:16:35.101 --> 00:16:35.934
<v Speaker 1>and that one particular discipline,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least resilient Jujitsu and you can </v>

434
00:16:39.361 --> 00:16:40.194
<v Speaker 1>get so much out of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially coming from your background </v>

435
00:16:41.581 --> 00:16:42.690
<v Speaker 1>as a wrestler.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

436
00:16:42.750 --> 00:16:44.580
<v Speaker 1>I was super impressed with your arm </v>
<v Speaker 1>triangle too,</v>

437
00:16:44.581 --> 00:16:46.170
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks clamped down on that.</v>

438
00:16:46.171 --> 00:16:47.520
<v Speaker 1>A head and arm choke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was nice.</v>

439
00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:48.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thanks a lot.</v>

440
00:16:49.630 --> 00:16:50.463
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a great style because I'm </v>

441
00:16:51.771 --> 00:16:52.604
<v Speaker 2>coming in with a wrestling background of</v>
<v Speaker 2>when a couple national championships </v>

442
00:16:54.741 --> 00:16:58.130
<v Speaker 2>there and then to come in with Raphael </v>
<v Speaker 2>once I put a guy down,</v>

443
00:16:58.160 --> 00:16:58.993
<v Speaker 2>now I need to finish them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it surprised me Lovato was a </v>

444
00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:04.940
<v Speaker 2>wrestling cause he's actually got some </v>
<v Speaker 2>good stuff that he does,</v>

445
00:17:05.210 --> 00:17:07.940
<v Speaker 2>but now I'm gonna be able to show him </v>
<v Speaker 2>that and he showed me his world and then</v>

446
00:17:07.941 --> 00:17:09.620
<v Speaker 2>we're growing together as boxing.</v>

447
00:17:09.850 --> 00:17:10.900
<v Speaker 1>That's so good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

448
00:17:10.901 --> 00:17:11.734
<v Speaker 1>That's so good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so interesting too because there's </v>

449
00:17:12.611 --> 00:17:16.480
<v Speaker 1>very few real submission artists today </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the heavyweight division,</v>

450
00:17:16.481 --> 00:17:18.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it used to be fade or when he was in his</v>

451
00:17:18.131 --> 00:17:19.930
<v Speaker 1>prime was submission artists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>

452
00:17:19.931 --> 00:17:21.970
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was the premiere submission artists,</v>

453
00:17:21.971 --> 00:17:24.580
<v Speaker 1>Frank Mir,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the all time greats for sure.</v>

454
00:17:24.581 --> 00:17:26.950
<v Speaker 1>And in terms of his accomplishments as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>submission artist,</v>

455
00:17:27.340 --> 00:17:29.320
<v Speaker 1>but there's not a whole lot of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>

456
00:17:29.530 --> 00:17:31.060
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see knockouts and stuff,</v>

457
00:17:31.090 --> 00:17:31.923
<v Speaker 1>especially in the UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't see a whole lot of </v>

458
00:17:33.461 --> 00:17:34.510
<v Speaker 1>submissions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

459
00:17:34.870 --> 00:17:35.930
<v Speaker 1>Except for doom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

460
00:17:35.931 --> 00:17:38.680
<v Speaker 1>if we're doing can still submit people </v>
<v Speaker 1>and won the title off of cane that way.</v>

461
00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:40.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

462
00:17:40.450 --> 00:17:41.283
<v Speaker 2>so I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm excited because statistically I </v>

463
00:17:42.701 --> 00:17:45.160
<v Speaker 2>think in my fights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I've put it on the ground,</v>

464
00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:49.150
<v Speaker 2>I've already finished it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But now having that guy with me coaching</v>

465
00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:50.573
<v Speaker 2>through,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

466
00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:52.620
<v Speaker 2>I heard them in the fight during the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight,</v>

467
00:17:52.621 --> 00:17:53.454
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing that and he's just telling me </v>

468
00:17:54.751 --> 00:17:57.150
<v Speaker 2>these little adjustments to me right </v>
<v Speaker 2>next to you while you were,</v>

469
00:17:57.360 --> 00:17:58.193
<v Speaker 2>he was across the cage where he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a good coach and I had the whole </v>

470
00:18:00.181 --> 00:18:03.240
<v Speaker 2>camp to sit there and listen to him </v>
<v Speaker 2>while he was off to the side.</v>

471
00:18:03.241 --> 00:18:05.520
<v Speaker 2>He's yelling at me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] yeah,</v>

472
00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:06.930
<v Speaker 2>Nice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trying to do that.</v>

473
00:18:06.931 --> 00:18:09.990
<v Speaker 2>And we used to do that at grudge </v>
<v Speaker 2>training center in Colorado.</v>

474
00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:10.830
<v Speaker 2>We would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

475
00:18:10.830 --> 00:18:12.960
<v Speaker 2>turn up the music,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'd blast it,</v>

476
00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:14.550
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>during sparring.</v>

477
00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:15.533
<v Speaker 2>And then we have our cornerman the off </v>
<v Speaker 2>to the side and they're hollering and </v>

478
00:18:18.091 --> 00:18:18.924
<v Speaker 2>yelling that we were able to start </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to pick their voices out with </v>

479
00:18:21.121 --> 00:18:23.130
<v Speaker 2>like a distraction with loud music going</v>
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>

480
00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:24.300
<v Speaker 2>just like in the fight.</v>

481
00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:27.480
<v Speaker 2>So that way if there's a huge crowd all </v>
<v Speaker 2>yelling out different stuff,</v>

482
00:18:27.481 --> 00:18:31.110
<v Speaker 2>you're able to tune into the voices you </v>
<v Speaker 2>need to hear who's idea was that?</v>

483
00:18:31.111 --> 00:18:33.150
<v Speaker 2>Trevor's yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trevor's Trevor Whitman.</v>

484
00:18:33.170 --> 00:18:34.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's smart.</v>

485
00:18:34.051 --> 00:18:35.220
<v Speaker 2>Very smart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very smart.</v>

486
00:18:35.610 --> 00:18:36.443
<v Speaker 2>Now how are you balancing out your full </v>
<v Speaker 2>time training now that you're moving up </v>

487
00:18:40.111 --> 00:18:43.120
<v Speaker 2>in the rankings and Bella Tor and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know you are,</v>

488
00:18:43.121 --> 00:18:43.954
<v Speaker 2>you're being more and more successful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're also doing this for a cause </v>

489
00:18:47.101 --> 00:18:52.101
<v Speaker 2>and for people don't know you are doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>this for your pygmy family,</v>

490
00:18:52.621 --> 00:18:53.454
<v Speaker 2>these people that you've sort of become </v>
<v Speaker 2>a part of their world and you've lived </v>

491
00:18:56.701 --> 00:18:59.900
<v Speaker 2>there for many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many months at a time and you,</v>

492
00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:00.753
<v Speaker 2>you go back and forth to help build </v>
<v Speaker 2>water wells with a water four and your </v>

493
00:19:04.531 --> 00:19:05.364
<v Speaker 2>organization fight for the forgotten and</v>
<v Speaker 2>how are you balancing that out with </v>

494
00:19:08.851 --> 00:19:09.684
<v Speaker 2>being a professional fighter and trying </v>
<v Speaker 2>to compete and perform at your very </v>

495
00:19:13.381 --> 00:19:14.214
<v Speaker 2>best?</v>

496
00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:14.601
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

497
00:19:14.601 --> 00:19:16.740
<v Speaker 2>that's been a learning process without a</v>
<v Speaker 2>doubt.</v>

498
00:19:16.741 --> 00:19:17.574
<v Speaker 2>But now it's trying to find ways to set </v>
<v Speaker 2>the right boundaries and in a way to </v>

499
00:19:21.571 --> 00:19:22.404
<v Speaker 2>protect my training schedule.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At first I was just saying yes to </v>

500
00:19:25.171 --> 00:19:27.150
<v Speaker 2>basically everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

501
00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:29.550
<v Speaker 2>and that made it really tough for my </v>
<v Speaker 2>first two fights back,</v>

502
00:19:29.830 --> 00:19:30.960
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where I felt rushed.</v>

503
00:19:30.961 --> 00:19:31.794
<v Speaker 2>I didn't feel like the muscle memory was</v>
<v Speaker 2>clicking in between every training </v>

504
00:19:34.111 --> 00:19:34.944
<v Speaker 2>session or I'd be late to training </v>
<v Speaker 2>sessions doing the interview or trying </v>

505
00:19:36.901 --> 00:19:37.734
<v Speaker 2>to talk to somebody or trying to tell </v>
<v Speaker 2>people the story or I would have to </v>

506
00:19:40.621 --> 00:19:42.480
<v Speaker 2>leave early to go do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now it's like,</v>

507
00:19:42.570 --> 00:19:45.000
<v Speaker 2>it's been really great to move to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Oklahoma City,</v>

508
00:19:45.001 --> 00:19:47.340
<v Speaker 2>have water for there to protect my </v>
<v Speaker 2>training schedule.</v>

509
00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:51.840
<v Speaker 2>And training comes first because if I </v>
<v Speaker 2>can keep going up in the ranks,</v>

510
00:19:51.841 --> 00:19:54.720
<v Speaker 2>if I can get a world championship under </v>
<v Speaker 2>my belt or a few,</v>

511
00:19:54.990 --> 00:19:55.823
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll have a bigger platform to stand on </v>

512
00:19:56.851 --> 00:19:57.950
<v Speaker 2>to tell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

513
00:19:57.960 --> 00:19:58.793
<v Speaker 2>have the bigger microphone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bigger platform to be able to continue </v>

514
00:20:00.511 --> 00:20:01.410
<v Speaker 2>to tell this story.</v>

515
00:20:01.770 --> 00:20:03.780
<v Speaker 2>And so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have a team about 10,</v>

516
00:20:03.810 --> 00:20:06.630
<v Speaker 2>12 people at water four,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've all rallied around it.</v>

517
00:20:06.631 --> 00:20:08.250
<v Speaker 2>They're trying to take stuff off my </v>
<v Speaker 2>plate,</v>

518
00:20:08.590 --> 00:20:11.820
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and be able to help fill in my schedule,</v>

519
00:20:11.821 --> 00:20:14.040
<v Speaker 2>but making sure I'm getting enough time </v>
<v Speaker 2>to get in the training,</v>

520
00:20:14.041 --> 00:20:17.250
<v Speaker 2>get in the rest and man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just eight,</v>

521
00:20:17.370 --> 00:20:19.950
<v Speaker 2>nine weeks of that before this last </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight,</v>

522
00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:21.420
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it truly paid off.</v>

523
00:20:21.421 --> 00:20:22.254
<v Speaker 2>It felt like there was a whole team </v>
<v Speaker 2>around making sure that going into this </v>

524
00:20:25.351 --> 00:20:28.350
<v Speaker 2>fight everything was exactly the way it </v>
<v Speaker 2>should be.</v>

525
00:20:28.351 --> 00:20:29.640
<v Speaker 2>And that's how I felt too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

526
00:20:29.641 --> 00:20:30.474
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

527
00:20:31.711 --> 00:20:32.740

<v Speaker 2>but I mean the,</v>

528
00:20:32.741 --> 00:20:34.070
<v Speaker 2>the crowd was just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

529
00:20:34.610 --> 00:20:35.443
<v Speaker 2>eh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was overwhelming and incredibly good </v>

530
00:20:38.131 --> 00:20:40.680
<v Speaker 2>way where it like felt I could feel the </v>
<v Speaker 2>energy.</v>

531

<v Speaker 3>a lot of work to do,</v>

576
00:22:25.950 --> 00:22:28.110

<v Speaker 3>That was my dance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But we do out in the forest.</v>

582
00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:46.180
<v Speaker 3>I just love them to be able to come in </v>
<v Speaker 3>here and fight through.</v>

583
00:22:47.100 --> 00:22:49.200
<v Speaker 3>Most people are lucky enough to have one</v>
<v Speaker 3>tribe.</v>

584
00:22:49.201 --> 00:22:50.034
<v Speaker 3>You have to not only a family Congo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>apparently here they were very much </v>

585
00:22:53.851 --> 00:22:54.684
<v Speaker 3>behind you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How did it feel to win in front of them </v>

586
00:23:01.750 --> 00:23:06.150
<v Speaker 3>from water for Oklahoma City Eco </v>
<v Speaker 3>Survivor?</v>

587
00:23:06.330 --> 00:23:07.580
<v Speaker 3>I'm just slow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

588
00:23:07.620 --> 00:23:08.453
<v Speaker 3>lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So fortunate jumped behind this because </v>

589
00:23:11.301 --> 00:23:14.120
<v Speaker 3>I love to fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love to be here and compete,</v>

590
00:23:14.330 --> 00:23:18.110
<v Speaker 3>but it's even better to fight for people</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so to know that fighting in here,</v>

591
00:23:18.140 --> 00:23:21.740
<v Speaker 3>getting a choke out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to go into Congo and knock out</v>

592
00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:25.120
<v Speaker 3>the world's water crisis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Moving forward.</v>

593
00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:28.480
<v Speaker 3>You said you have a lot of room to grow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but with performances like that,</v>

594
00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:31.270
<v Speaker 3>people are thinking about you in a wide </v>
<v Speaker 3>open heavyweight division.</v>

595
00:23:31.271 --> 00:23:32.480
<v Speaker 3>What's next for you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

596
00:23:32.481 --> 00:23:35.780
<v Speaker 3>I'm coming for that balance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's going to come and just might take a</v>

597
00:23:35.781 --> 00:23:38.750
<v Speaker 3>little bit of time to get there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm still getting my feet under me.</v>

598
00:23:38.751 --> 00:23:42.650
<v Speaker 3>I had five years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two months where I did zero training and</v>

599
00:23:42.651 --> 00:23:46.070
<v Speaker 3>so I'm excited to get back in there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Keep my way up.</v>

600
00:23:46.071 --> 00:23:48.230
<v Speaker 3>I got to earn it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I have,</v>

601
00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:52.700
<v Speaker 3>I think more of a reason,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a purpose of passion to be in here.</v>

602
00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:55.040
<v Speaker 3>And so I'm just so thankful for everyone</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's got behind us.</v>

<v Speaker 3>of their profits of their entire brand </v>

604

605
00:24:03.461 --> 00:24:04.670

<v Speaker 3>That's what I'm in here.</v>

614
00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:36.280
<v Speaker 3>We are not different and so a sequel </v>
<v Speaker 3>meaningi it's been many,</v>

615
00:24:36.291 --> 00:24:37.124
<v Speaker 3>many days.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't wait to come back and see you </v>

<v Speaker 3>very soon and drill some more.</v>

617
00:24:41.571 --> 00:24:44.080
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the big pig meat,</v>

618
00:24:45.420 --> 00:24:49.770
<v Speaker 2>that's a crazy platform man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To be able to do that on tv like that in</v>

619
00:24:49.771 --> 00:24:50.604
<v Speaker 2>front of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean who knows how many millions of </v>

620
00:24:51.361 --> 00:24:52.194
<v Speaker 2>people watch too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that came to the 1.1 or 1.2 is </v>

621
00:24:56.070 --> 00:24:59.250
<v Speaker 2>the headline.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was a Marlos,</v>

622
00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:01.470
<v Speaker 2>Conan and Julia Bud for that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

623
00:25:01.950 --> 00:25:04.020
<v Speaker 2>inaugural featherweight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe,</v>

624
00:25:04.021 --> 00:25:04.854
<v Speaker 2>or a world title.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you feel like Bella towards getting </v>

625
00:25:06.721 --> 00:25:07.790
<v Speaker 2>more respect now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's,</v>

626
00:25:07.791 --> 00:25:09.750
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's becoming more of a,</v>

627
00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:13.320
<v Speaker 2>like for a while it was looked at as </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of a,</v>

628
00:25:13.330 --> 00:25:14.700
<v Speaker 2>an also ran,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

629
00:25:14.701 --> 00:25:18.150
<v Speaker 2>but I think like now with the lineups </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting stronger and stronger,</v>

630
00:25:18.151 --> 00:25:18.984
<v Speaker 2>it seems like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

631
00:25:19.050 --> 00:25:21.870
<v Speaker 2>the organization is growing and </v>
<v Speaker 2>notoriety.</v>

632
00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:22.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe so.</v>

633
00:25:23.070 --> 00:25:23.891
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

634
00:25:23.891 --> 00:25:26.100
<v Speaker 2>I think it's healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very important.</v>

635
00:25:26.101 --> 00:25:27.870
<v Speaker 2>I think it's good for everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

636
00:25:27.900 --> 00:25:28.740
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

637
00:25:28.741 --> 00:25:30.210
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and great for the fighters.</v>

638
00:25:30.270 --> 00:25:32.100
<v Speaker 2>My bosses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my disagree right.</v>

639
00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:34.200
<v Speaker 2>At the UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I really think I actually,</v>

640
00:25:34.201 --> 00:25:35.970
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they would.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they'd probably agree.</v>

641
00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.070
<v Speaker 2>I think it's important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's important to have competition.</v>

642
00:25:38.090 --> 00:25:39.360
<v Speaker 2>It's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's good for everybody.</v>

643
00:25:39.450 --> 00:25:40.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

644
00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:41.071
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

645
00:25:41.071 --> 00:25:42.910
<v Speaker 2>I think Bader just came over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

646
00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:44.540
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Phil Davis,</v>

647
00:25:44.990 --> 00:25:47.070
<v Speaker 2>Davis is the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the light heavyweight champion now.</v>

648
00:25:47.130 --> 00:25:47.821
<v Speaker 2>Yep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

649
00:25:47.821 --> 00:25:49.620
<v Speaker 2>So you don't really have a heavyweight </v>
<v Speaker 2>champion?</v>

650
00:25:49.621 --> 00:25:50.454
<v Speaker 2>Is that what's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are they stripped fatale Melnikov of it </v>

651
00:25:52.021 --> 00:25:52.854
<v Speaker 2>because he's fighting over his contract.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Allowed them to fight and fight nights </v>

652
00:25:55.681 --> 00:25:58.200
<v Speaker 2>or efn over in Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went over there,</v>

653
00:25:58.260 --> 00:26:00.600
<v Speaker 2>Corner Josh against fatale.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

654
00:26:00.660 --> 00:26:04.140
<v Speaker 2>and so he just hasn't come back and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>just has,</v>

655
00:26:04.170 --> 00:26:07.140
<v Speaker 2>I think he's making money in Russia and </v>
<v Speaker 2>fighting there and,</v>

656
00:26:07.141 --> 00:26:07.591
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

657
00:26:07.591 --> 00:26:10.440
<v Speaker 2>they're kind of been in a standoff and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he can come back and fight,</v>

658
00:26:10.441 --> 00:26:11.730
<v Speaker 2>but he's been stripped of his belt.</v>

659
00:26:11.970 --> 00:26:14.030
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and now I think they're,</v>

660
00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:15.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Scott's a smart guy,</v>

661
00:26:15.301 --> 00:26:16.610
<v Speaker 2>so it was rich.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

662
00:26:16.650 --> 00:26:19.080
<v Speaker 2>they're putting something together for </v>
<v Speaker 2>the heavyweights and uh,</v>

663
00:26:19.620 --> 00:26:21.600
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fade or Matt Mitrione fight,</v>

664
00:26:21.601 --> 00:26:23.430
<v Speaker 2>that's going to be exciting to watch for</v>
<v Speaker 2>a title though,</v>

665
00:26:23.431 --> 00:26:25.830
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But is that a three rounder?</v>

666
00:26:26.190 --> 00:26:27.450
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Three,</v>

667
00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:28.313
<v Speaker 2>three fives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when are they gonna try to have a </v>

668
00:26:29.701 --> 00:26:32.280
<v Speaker 2>heavyweight title?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's coming up pretty soon,</v>

669
00:26:32.310 --> 00:26:34.050
<v Speaker 2>so I think probably in the next six </v>
<v Speaker 2>months.</v>

670
00:26:34.051 --> 00:26:34.530
<v Speaker 2>Where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

671
00:26:34.530 --> 00:26:35.363
<v Speaker 2>within that next three months now </v>
<v Speaker 2>looking at yourself and your own </v>

672
00:26:37.801 --> 00:26:38.634
<v Speaker 2>development and growth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how far away do you feel like you are </v>

673
00:26:40.741 --> 00:26:43.060
<v Speaker 2>from that fighting for that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Me,</v>

674
00:26:43.230 --> 00:26:43.890
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

675
00:26:43.890 --> 00:26:46.200
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want it now.</v>

676
00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:48.090
<v Speaker 2>I want to take that now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

677
00:26:48.091 --> 00:26:50.250
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that realistically being smart,</v>

678
00:26:50.251 --> 00:26:51.084
<v Speaker 2>strategic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get another couple of wins under my </v>

679
00:26:52.231 --> 00:26:53.064
<v Speaker 2>belt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some good wins or I get to go in there </v>

680
00:26:54.491 --> 00:26:56.310
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and really show to myself,</v>

681
00:26:56.311 --> 00:27:00.470
<v Speaker 2>to Bella torn one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need to earn it and to um,</v>

682
00:27:00.750 --> 00:27:03.420
<v Speaker 2>I need to get a couple more real </v>
<v Speaker 2>impressive wins under my belt.</v>

683
00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:04.590
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and yeah,</v>

684
00:27:04.591 --> 00:27:08.340
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I know who I am as a fighter and</v>

685
00:27:08.341 --> 00:27:09.174
<v Speaker 2>I can hang with those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just I need to to build back cause </v>

686
00:27:11.671 --> 00:27:13.260
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a long time off.</v>

687
00:27:14.790 --> 00:27:15.623
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a long time off and then train </v>

688
00:27:16.621 --> 00:27:17.460
<v Speaker 2>week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Great guys.</v>

689
00:27:17.490 --> 00:27:18.323
<v Speaker 2>I think in the next two or three fights </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll really start taking big steps up </v>

690
00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:23.340
<v Speaker 2>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

691
00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:24.720
<v Speaker 2>after that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe in the next two,</v>

692
00:27:24.721 --> 00:27:27.150
<v Speaker 2>three years I'll have that belt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

693
00:27:27.151 --> 00:27:28.040
<v Speaker 2>They have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

694
00:27:28.540 --> 00:27:31.410
<v Speaker 2>their division is interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now rampage is going to heavyweight too,</v>

695
00:27:31.411 --> 00:27:32.430
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

696
00:27:32.460 --> 00:27:33.211
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

<v Speaker 2>And one of his fighters fat shaming when</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're about to beat the fuck out of </v>

<v Speaker 2>each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So these lanterns you've brought me,</v>

708
00:28:00.511 --> 00:28:01.470
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thank you.</v>

709
00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:04.530
<v Speaker 2>Second of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is the deal with these bad boys?</v>

710
00:28:04.980 --> 00:28:07.500
<v Speaker 2>So this is the first product that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>had developed.</v>

711
00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:09.210
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's ECO survivor.</v>

712
00:28:09.211 --> 00:28:11.460
<v Speaker 2>They're also out of Oklahoma City.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is the common of,</v>

713
00:28:11.461 --> 00:28:14.820
<v Speaker 2>is donating 50% of their money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their profits to waterfall.</v>

714
00:28:14.850 --> 00:28:16.410
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so all the packaging,</v>

715
00:28:16.411 --> 00:28:18.720
<v Speaker 2>this is old packaging,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but know the water.</v>

716
00:28:18.721 --> 00:28:22.110
<v Speaker 2>Four is the company that's building </v>
<v Speaker 2>these wells in the Congo for the pygmies</v>

717
00:28:22.111 --> 00:28:24.450
<v Speaker 2>and is the organization that you work </v>
<v Speaker 2>closely with.</v>

718
00:28:25.050 --> 00:28:25.883
<v Speaker 2>And so they started eco survivor so that</v>
<v Speaker 2>it could be basically an empowerment </v>

719
00:28:29.101 --> 00:28:30.960
<v Speaker 2>mechanism on all the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the packaging.</v>

720
00:28:30.961 --> 00:28:33.780
<v Speaker 2>It's going to have a picture of me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a picture of the wells,</v>

721
00:28:33.781 --> 00:28:34.830
<v Speaker 2>a picture of the pygmies.</v>

722
00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:36.780
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we're going to tell the story.</v>

723
00:28:36.781 --> 00:28:41.781
<v Speaker 2>And when they go to eco survivor.com,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I think just launched looks great.</v>

724
00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:45.900
<v Speaker 2>You would almost think it's a nonprofit </v>
<v Speaker 2>website because they're highlighting the</v>

725
00:28:45.901 --> 00:28:46.734
<v Speaker 2>cause so much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they were talking about how we make </v>

726

<v Speaker 2>it sustainable there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>empower them with sustainable business </v>

727
00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:52.831
<v Speaker 2>and they're like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>So I don't,</v>

765
00:30:21.251 --> 00:30:23.380
<v Speaker 2>I do know this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that a dome structure,</v>

766
00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:25.480
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the strongest thing out there.</v>

767
00:30:25.780 --> 00:30:26.890
<v Speaker 2>It's plastic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

768
00:30:26.891 --> 00:30:28.060
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is a plastic,</v>

769
00:30:28.061 --> 00:30:30.400
<v Speaker 2>which is a super strong plot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>super strong plastic.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Omni directional lighting,</v>

771
00:30:36.251 --> 00:30:37.084
<v Speaker 2>which basically just means it goes all </v>
<v Speaker 2>around and there's no blind spots with </v>

772
00:30:39.741 --> 00:30:42.040
<v Speaker 2>the light for the most part.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then on it's killer man.</v>

773
00:30:42.070 --> 00:30:43.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then so from there we're going to do</v>

774
00:30:43.870 --> 00:30:45.580
<v Speaker 2>flashlights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>headlamps,</v>

<v Speaker 2>bluetooth speakers that have battery </v>

776
00:30:49.211 --> 00:30:52.840
<v Speaker 2>packs in them than just battery packs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then we're doing walkie talkies,</v>

777
00:30:52.841 --> 00:30:54.820
<v Speaker 2>walkie talkies that have battery packs </v>
<v Speaker 2>in them.</v>

778
00:30:55.180 --> 00:30:56.410
<v Speaker 2>No Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

779
00:30:56.411 --> 00:30:57.244

<v Speaker 2>the everyday adventure can be part of </v>

780
00:31:00.551 --> 00:31:01.000

783
00:31:06.011 --> 00:31:08.350
<v Speaker 2>Congo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then when people are buying it here,</v>

784
00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:09.393
<v Speaker 2>they know that 50% of their purchase or </v>
<v Speaker 2>the profits from the purchase are going </v>

785

<v Speaker 2>dirty water and heavy,</v>

813
00:32:24.130 --> 00:32:25.510
<v Speaker 2>heavy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>44 pounds.</v>

814
00:32:25.540 --> 00:32:27.640
<v Speaker 2>It's a 20 liters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>five gallons.</v>

815
00:32:27.730 --> 00:32:30.400
<v Speaker 2>Most people have no idea how hard it is </v>
<v Speaker 2>to carry 40 pounds.</v>

816
00:32:30.740 --> 00:32:32.270
<v Speaker 2>I well think about one of those </v>
<v Speaker 2>kettlebells,</v>

817
00:32:32.300 --> 00:32:33.130
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

818
00:32:33.130 --> 00:32:33.963
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

819
00:32:34.060 --> 00:32:34.893
<v Speaker 2>and then a lot of times the women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the women do two at a time and the </v>

820
00:32:37.091 --> 00:32:37.924
<v Speaker 2>children do one.</v>

821
00:32:38.310 --> 00:32:41.670
<v Speaker 2>And so these little can't go to school </v>
<v Speaker 2>cause they and that water walk,</v>

822
00:32:41.671 --> 00:32:43.190
<v Speaker 2>but they are not doing that one time a </v>
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>

823
00:32:43.250 --> 00:32:45.050
<v Speaker 2>They're doing it two and three times a </v>
<v Speaker 2>day because they're,</v>

824
00:32:45.051 --> 00:32:48.140
<v Speaker 2>their household needs more than just </v>
<v Speaker 2>five gallons of water.</v>

825
00:32:48.650 --> 00:32:52.180
<v Speaker 2>And so a lot of times the girls can't be</v>
<v Speaker 2>sent to school or the kids can't read.</v>

826
00:32:52.181 --> 00:32:54.620
<v Speaker 2>They have to pick one of the kids that </v>
<v Speaker 2>can go to school.</v>

827
00:32:54.621 --> 00:32:56.690
<v Speaker 2>So the other ones can go collect water </v>
<v Speaker 2>all day.</v>

828
00:32:57.050 --> 00:32:59.630
<v Speaker 2>I think it's over a billion days each </v>
<v Speaker 2>year,</v>

829
00:33:00.050 --> 00:33:00.883
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>workdays that are lost just because of </v>

830
00:33:02.571 --> 00:33:06.020
<v Speaker 2>the women that have to go do the water </v>
<v Speaker 2>walks over a billion workdays.</v>

831
00:33:06.070 --> 00:33:07.360
<v Speaker 2>And there you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

832
00:33:07.460 --> 00:33:11.240
<v Speaker 2>and if people have never seen any of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>episodes that Justin was on before,</v>

833
00:33:11.241 --> 00:33:14.720
<v Speaker 2>please watch the last ones a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you get a chance,</v>

834
00:33:14.750 --> 00:33:16.190
<v Speaker 2>it'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll catch up more.</v>

835
00:33:16.191 --> 00:33:17.024
<v Speaker 2>To what you've gone through,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what some of these people have gone </v>

836
00:33:19.071 --> 00:33:19.904
<v Speaker 2>through,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the kind of parasites these people get </v>

837
00:33:20.901 --> 00:33:21.734
<v Speaker 2>from this water and how important it </v>
<v Speaker 2>says for you and how much growth and </v>

838
00:33:24.861 --> 00:33:28.340
<v Speaker 2>progress has been over the past few </v>
<v Speaker 2>years of your efforts down there.</v>

839
00:33:28.420 --> 00:33:30.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well thank you so much.</v>

840
00:33:30.261 --> 00:33:31.280
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's been incredible.</v>

841
00:33:31.281 --> 00:33:32.510
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>emily was telling me,</v>

842
00:33:32.511 --> 00:33:33.344
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my wife,</v>

843
00:33:33.660 --> 00:33:35.360
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>coming here that wow,</v>

844
00:33:35.361 --> 00:33:36.194
<v Speaker 2>this was over four years ago when you </v>
<v Speaker 2>were on Joe show the first time and we </v>

845
00:33:39.951 --> 00:33:42.050
<v Speaker 2>hadn't drilled one single well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's crazy.</v>

846
00:33:42.290 --> 00:33:44.240
<v Speaker 2>I had just been there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

847
00:33:44.270 --> 00:33:46.910
<v Speaker 2>Andy Bo had happened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the one and a half year old boy that had</v>

848
00:33:46.911 --> 00:33:50.630
<v Speaker 2>passed away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I held his lifeless body and buried them</v>

849
00:33:50.631 --> 00:33:53.000
<v Speaker 2>and just did a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it ripped me open,</v>

850
00:33:53.020 --> 00:33:53.853
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tore my heart apart like you would </v>

851
00:33:55.041 --> 00:33:55.874
<v Speaker 2>anyone like it would anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it was just a rude awakening to the </v>

852
00:33:59.661 --> 00:34:04.661
<v Speaker 2>water crisis that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there's 800 kids every day die just</v>

853
00:34:04.821 --> 00:34:08.690
<v Speaker 2>because of diarrhea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like literally die from diarrhea.</v>

854
00:34:08.810 --> 00:34:10.640
<v Speaker 2>And then 2000,</v>
<v Speaker 2>350,</v>

855
00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:12.433
<v Speaker 2>2000,</v>
<v Speaker 2>350 die of the malnutrition that </v>

856
00:34:14.091 --> 00:34:14.924
<v Speaker 2>diarrhea causes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you're in an area that doesn't </v>

857
00:34:17.091 --> 00:34:17.924
<v Speaker 2>have access to clean water,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's probably not an abundance of </v>

858
00:34:19.941 --> 00:34:20.774
<v Speaker 2>food around you.</v>

859
00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:21.793
<v Speaker 2>But even the food that you do get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're eating it and it goes right </v>

860
00:34:24.261 --> 00:34:27.860
<v Speaker 2>through you because you have diarrhea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't absorb any of the nutrients.</v>

861
00:34:28.540 --> 00:34:30.410
<v Speaker 2>And so that's over 3000 just because of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

862
00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:33.470
<v Speaker 2>And then that's not counting a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the sicknesses and everything else,</v>

863
00:34:33.471 --> 00:34:34.400
<v Speaker 2>typhoid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nikolai.</v>

864
00:34:34.401 --> 00:34:39.260
<v Speaker 2>And so that's 1.5 million deaths a year </v>
<v Speaker 2>of children under the age of five,</v>

865
00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:42.080
<v Speaker 2>1.5 million.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of them are preventable.</v>

866
00:34:43.130 --> 00:34:46.220
<v Speaker 2>And so like I truly believe man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we have,</v>

867
00:34:46.910 --> 00:34:50.900
<v Speaker 2>we've found something really special at </v>
<v Speaker 2>water four and others,</v>

868
00:34:51.140 --> 00:34:54.470
<v Speaker 2>other organizations that I'm sure are </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing it in different spaces.</v>

869
00:34:54.471 --> 00:34:57.650
<v Speaker 2>But I feel like us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are doing it in a way that we put the</v>

870
00:34:57.651 --> 00:34:59.750
<v Speaker 2>tools in the hands of the people that </v>
<v Speaker 2>need it the most.</v>

871
00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:03.590
<v Speaker 2>The people in the community,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean our teams,</v>

872
00:35:03.591 --> 00:35:06.290
<v Speaker 2>18 people and we've first year that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>was there.</v>

873
00:35:06.290 --> 00:35:09.200
<v Speaker 2>So in the last five years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've lived there for about two years,</v>

874
00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:10.780
<v Speaker 2>back and forth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one once,</v>

875
00:35:10.910 --> 00:35:11.743
<v Speaker 2>one year at one time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then Ida was able to help drill and </v>

876
00:35:15.621 --> 00:35:19.040
<v Speaker 2>train them for the first 13 wells.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The year I was stepping back,</v>

877
00:35:19.041 --> 00:35:19.821
<v Speaker 2>I was nervous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

878
00:35:19.821 --> 00:35:22.130
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to be there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't micromanage.</v>

879
00:35:22.131 --> 00:35:23.200
<v Speaker 2>These guys are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't watch him.</v>

880
00:35:23.201 --> 00:35:24.980
<v Speaker 2>Mccain encourage them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

881
00:35:24.981 --> 00:35:26.390
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to micromanage anyone,</v>

882
00:35:26.391 --> 00:35:31.391
<v Speaker 2>but I can't be there to do the work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then they're able to do 20 wells the</v>

883
00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:32.750
<v Speaker 2>year without me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The next year.</v>

884
00:35:32.770 --> 00:35:36.050
<v Speaker 2>The last year they did 29 so we're up to</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think 62 wells,</v>

885
00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:37.113
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they've drilled for themselves and </v>

886
00:35:38.341 --> 00:35:40.080
<v Speaker 2>their own community.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>

887
00:35:40.081 --> 00:35:40.914
<v Speaker 2>our guys have 18 but water four has 375 </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they drilled 690 water wells last </v>

888
00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:47.280
<v Speaker 2>year alone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

889
00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:50.040
<v Speaker 2>And that served.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So those are 375 people in the continent</v>

890
00:35:50.041 --> 00:35:52.860
<v Speaker 2>of Africa that live in 16 African </v>
<v Speaker 2>nations.</v>

891
00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:57.780
<v Speaker 2>And they were able to give 172,000 </v>
<v Speaker 2>people clean water for the first time in</v>

892
00:35:57.781 --> 00:35:59.460
<v Speaker 2>their lives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

893
00:35:59.461 --> 00:36:00.630
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

894
00:36:00.631 --> 00:36:01.464
<v Speaker 2>we can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can knock this water crisis out in </v>

895
00:36:02.611 --> 00:36:06.120
<v Speaker 2>our lifetime if that's what we do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we give them the solution.</v>

896
00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:07.580
<v Speaker 2>That's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

897
00:36:07.581 --> 00:36:10.410
<v Speaker 2>that's amazing progress.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And just a few years,</v>

898
00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:11.670
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's been a,</v>

899
00:36:12.750 --> 00:36:13.583
<v Speaker 2>it's blown me away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but so talk to me about how belt or is </v>

900
00:36:15.271 --> 00:36:17.190
<v Speaker 2>helping and how they're getting behind </v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

901
00:36:17.730 --> 00:36:19.380
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what really sold me with,</v>

902
00:36:19.710 --> 00:36:20.543
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had offers from most places when I </v>

903
00:36:21.871 --> 00:36:23.160
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I came back and,</v>

904
00:36:23.340 --> 00:36:24.600
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

905
00:36:24.810 --> 00:36:27.200
<v Speaker 2>but when I sat down with Scott and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

906
00:36:28.470 --> 00:36:29.830
<v Speaker 2>and I was writing the book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

907
00:36:29.940 --> 00:36:30.773
<v Speaker 2>with Loretta and went out to eat with </v>
<v Speaker 2>them in Santa Monica and he was just </v>

908
00:36:34.561 --> 00:36:35.220
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

909
00:36:35.220 --> 00:36:37.740
<v Speaker 2>like we want to give you a chance to </v>
<v Speaker 2>really tell your story.</v>

910
00:36:37.770 --> 00:36:38.910
<v Speaker 2>Like you need to fight.</v>

911
00:36:38.970 --> 00:36:40.830
<v Speaker 2>You got to prove it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you have to have that,</v>

912
00:36:41.190 --> 00:36:43.020
<v Speaker 2>that hard work and skill and talent </v>
<v Speaker 2>behind you.</v>

913
00:36:43.470 --> 00:36:45.900
<v Speaker 2>You have to be able to perform.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you can do that,</v>

914
00:36:45.901 --> 00:36:47.860
<v Speaker 2>we're going to rally around you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

915
00:36:48.030 --> 00:36:49.850
<v Speaker 2>they want to rally around their fighters</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

916
00:36:50.220 --> 00:36:52.080
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that put in the time,</v>

917
00:36:52.081 --> 00:36:54.150
<v Speaker 2>the effort that they can produce </v>
<v Speaker 2>results.</v>

918
00:36:54.151 --> 00:36:55.520
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

919
00:36:55.710 --> 00:36:56.543
<v Speaker 2>it was really encouraging to hear that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I was bummed out the first two </v>

920
00:36:58.651 --> 00:36:59.131
<v Speaker 2>fights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

921
00:36:59.131 --> 00:36:59.964
<v Speaker 2>I won,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't win decisively like I </v>

922
00:37:01.321 --> 00:37:02.154
<v Speaker 2>wanted to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So to get this last fight underneath me </v>

923
00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:07.590
<v Speaker 2>where really performed well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

924
00:37:07.830 --> 00:37:10.680
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and was pretty dominant like a,</v>

925
00:37:10.681 --> 00:37:12.930
<v Speaker 2>I think they know that I can fight and </v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

926
00:37:13.290 --> 00:37:14.123
<v Speaker 2>and I know I can fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so now we can do this in a way that </v>

927
00:37:17.910 --> 00:37:19.110
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I win,</v>

928
00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:22.200
<v Speaker 2>literally wells are being drilled every </v>
<v Speaker 2>single time.</v>

929
00:37:22.530 --> 00:37:26.550
<v Speaker 2>And so eco survivor is helping me drill </v>
<v Speaker 2>several wells after this last one.</v>

930
00:37:26.670 --> 00:37:27.960
<v Speaker 2>That's a chronicle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

931
00:37:28.350 --> 00:37:30.870
<v Speaker 2>Now how do you balance out your training</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're,</v>

932
00:37:31.140 --> 00:37:33.270
<v Speaker 2>when you're visiting the Congo and </v>
<v Speaker 2>staying there?</v>

933
00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:35.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so a tough thing is,</v>

934
00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:36.233
<v Speaker 2>so I kind of shared a little bit of our </v>
<v Speaker 2>model and how we give the tools for the </v>

935
00:37:38.911 --> 00:37:39.890
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

936
00:37:40.410 --> 00:37:44.160
<v Speaker 2>in the community.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So my travel schedule,</v>

937
00:37:44.161 --> 00:37:45.870
<v Speaker 2>it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's been a hard pill to swallow,</v>

938
00:37:45.871 --> 00:37:46.704
<v Speaker 2>but I think it's the most strategic </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing where I'm only going to go once a </v>

939
00:37:48.781 --> 00:37:49.820
<v Speaker 2>year now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

940
00:37:49.930 --> 00:37:53.370
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to go once a year because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>need to be here training.</v>

941
00:37:53.790 --> 00:37:54.960
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's my,</v>

942
00:37:55.290 --> 00:37:56.123
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at first I thought I was the one that </v>

943
00:37:57.630 --> 00:37:59.840
<v Speaker 2>that made this thing go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But really it's,</v>

944
00:38:00.170 --> 00:38:01.650
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's our guys in the field,</v>

945
00:38:01.651 --> 00:38:04.670
<v Speaker 2>they're the engine and I was maybe the </v>
<v Speaker 2>spark plug that,</v>

946
00:38:04.710 --> 00:38:05.543
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that kind of started up something and </v>

947
00:38:06.931 --> 00:38:10.180
<v Speaker 2>now I get to go back and be the </v>
<v Speaker 2>encourager or to fuel and back up.</v>

948
00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:11.273
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're the ones doing the work and </v>

949
00:38:13.261 --> 00:38:16.590
<v Speaker 2>so I'm only going to go once a year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll probably fight in June or July.</v>

950
00:38:16.770 --> 00:38:17.603
<v Speaker 2>I was talking with Bella tour and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>right after that we're starting up a </v>

951
00:38:19.831 --> 00:38:23.610
<v Speaker 2>soap production facility in Congo with </v>
<v Speaker 2>our guys is going to start another eight</v>

952
00:38:23.611 --> 00:38:27.120
<v Speaker 2>to 10 jobs because we go in and we teach</v>
<v Speaker 2>the wash program.</v>

953
00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:28.890
<v Speaker 2>So we need,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

954
00:38:29.580 --> 00:38:30.413
<v Speaker 2>we need them to start making soap for </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves because right now the only </v>

955
00:38:33.301 --> 00:38:34.134
<v Speaker 2>thing I've ever seen available is car </v>
<v Speaker 2>washing soap that's packed full of </v>

956
00:38:37.121 --> 00:38:37.954
<v Speaker 2>chemicals from China or India and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>have all the Ross themselves with </v>

957
00:38:40.961 --> 00:38:43.420
<v Speaker 2>carwash.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did while I was there for the year and</v>

958
00:38:43.421 --> 00:38:46.240
<v Speaker 2>my skin would be raw afterwards cause </v>
<v Speaker 2>there was nothing else available.</v>

959
00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:49.330
<v Speaker 2>I mean I took soap with me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when I was there for a full year,</v>

960
00:38:49.570 --> 00:38:51.340
<v Speaker 2>I mean it only lasted for the first </v>
<v Speaker 2>month maybe.</v>

961
00:38:51.780 --> 00:38:53.770
<v Speaker 2>So the rest of the time I was using this</v>
<v Speaker 2>car washing soap,</v>

962
00:38:53.771 --> 00:38:54.604
<v Speaker 2>that man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

963
00:38:54.850 --> 00:38:56.380
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's rough on your body.</v>

964
00:38:56.410 --> 00:39:00.790
<v Speaker 2>And so we are partnering with a company </v>
<v Speaker 2>called Pasha soap there at all the whole</v>

965
00:39:00.791 --> 00:39:03.340
<v Speaker 2>foods and they have a sister company,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

966
00:39:03.460 --> 00:39:07.060
<v Speaker 2>a Mozzie there at target.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And though those guys go around and they</v>

967
00:39:07.061 --> 00:39:07.894
<v Speaker 2>start up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so production facilities in the </v>

968
00:39:09.191 --> 00:39:12.370
<v Speaker 2>developing nation to give jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So is it possible that that could become</v>

969
00:39:12.371 --> 00:39:13.204
<v Speaker 2>an industry for the people in the Congo </v>
<v Speaker 2>where they can start selling their soul </v>

970
00:39:15.350 --> 00:39:16.270
<v Speaker 2>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

971
00:39:16.390 --> 00:39:19.090
<v Speaker 2>maybe eco survivor could sell it on </v>
<v Speaker 2>their website as well?</v>

972
00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:19.953
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

973
00:39:20.380 --> 00:39:22.050
<v Speaker 2>Or start up a new,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

974
00:39:22.220 --> 00:39:23.200
<v Speaker 2>that other company.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:25.240
<v Speaker 2>Pocho which has been great to us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They actually,</v>

976
00:39:25.620 --> 00:39:26.453
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of cool story that the founder of </v>

<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

980
00:39:35.320 --> 00:39:37.960

<v Speaker 2>through the night shift.</v>

981
00:39:37.990 --> 00:39:38.823
<v Speaker 2>And he was listening to this and he had </v>
<v Speaker 2>the dreams to start up Pocho he helped </v>

<v Speaker 2>and he's coming with me this next trip.</v>

991
00:40:04.390 --> 00:40:05.223
<v Speaker 2>We're actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he might not come because we don't </v>

992
00:40:05.951 --> 00:40:09.340
<v Speaker 2>really take volunteers now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We just empower the locals.</v>

993
00:40:09.670 --> 00:40:10.503
<v Speaker 2>But we're going to start up that soap </v>
<v Speaker 2>production facility and it's going to </v>

994
00:40:12.061 --> 00:40:16.060
<v Speaker 2>start eight to 10 new jobs will go into </v>
<v Speaker 2>schools and t because last year our team</v>

995
00:40:16.061 --> 00:40:18.850
<v Speaker 2>spent 301 days teaching the wash </v>
<v Speaker 2>program.</v>

996
00:40:19.150 --> 00:40:21.520
<v Speaker 2>So teaching water and sanitation and </v>
<v Speaker 2>hygiene,</v>

997
00:40:21.521 --> 00:40:22.354
<v Speaker 2>helping them dig latrines,</v>
<v Speaker 2>helping them know the importance of </v>

998
00:40:26.020 --> 00:40:27.370
<v Speaker 2>clean hands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we set up,</v>

999
00:40:27.430 --> 00:40:30.010
<v Speaker 2>set up outside the latrines,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a hand washing station,</v>

1000
00:40:30.250 --> 00:40:33.850
<v Speaker 2>which is called a tippy tap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they have a clean jug of water,</v>

1001
00:40:33.880 --> 00:40:34.713
<v Speaker 2>they have a bar soap,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they step on a stick in a rope and it </v>

1002
00:40:36.940 --> 00:40:40.540
<v Speaker 2>tilts this jug over and they're able to </v>
<v Speaker 2>wash their hands right there.</v>

1003
00:40:41.470 --> 00:40:43.480
<v Speaker 2>But then they only had that car washing </v>
<v Speaker 2>soap.</v>

1004
00:40:43.481 --> 00:40:46.150
<v Speaker 2>So now we're going to meet another need,</v>
<v Speaker 2>start up the soap production.</v>

1005
00:40:46.151 --> 00:40:48.220

<v Speaker 2>the palm oil,</v>

1006
00:40:48.221 --> 00:40:49.540

<v Speaker 2>it over there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then when they go,</v>

1041
00:42:04.221 --> 00:42:08.360
<v Speaker 2>they go with huge amounts and they say </v>
<v Speaker 2>if they're dropping off shoes or clothes</v>

1042
00:42:08.361 --> 00:42:09.194
<v Speaker 2>or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the local people that have a shoe store </v>

1043
00:42:11.880 --> 00:42:12.713
<v Speaker 2>go out of business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whenever you bring in containers and </v>

1044
00:42:14.271 --> 00:42:15.104
<v Speaker 2>containers of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of shoes and where the guy that's </v>

1045
00:42:17.751 --> 00:42:20.150
<v Speaker 2>repairing the shoes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the cobbler,</v>

1046
00:42:20.180 --> 00:42:21.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the one that's making,</v>

1047
00:42:21.740 --> 00:42:22.573
<v Speaker 2>she was there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you can't just go into the community </v>

1048
00:42:23.871 --> 00:42:24.704
<v Speaker 2>and give it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually watched a documentary recently </v>

1049
00:42:26.601 --> 00:42:30.410
<v Speaker 2>called Poverty Inc man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was powerful showing how,</v>

1050
00:42:30.860 --> 00:42:31.693
<v Speaker 2>how charity hurts or how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's also a great book out called </v>

1051
00:42:34.761 --> 00:42:37.730
<v Speaker 2>when helping hurts and it talks about </v>
<v Speaker 2>hey charities,</v>

1052
00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:41.060
<v Speaker 2>awesome in and when it's absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 2>needed,</v>

1053
00:42:41.630 --> 00:42:43.880
<v Speaker 2>but it's very dangerous if you use it in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the wrong way,</v>

1054
00:42:44.150 --> 00:42:45.500
<v Speaker 2>you can cripple a community.</v>

1055
00:42:45.530 --> 00:42:48.410
<v Speaker 2>And so how do we empower the local </v>
<v Speaker 2>communities with a hand massage,</v>

1056
00:42:48.450 --> 00:42:51.950
<v Speaker 2>pull the community by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by giving them something for nothing.</v>

1057
00:42:52.370 --> 00:42:54.440
<v Speaker 2>I give him something for nothing either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Either.</v>

1058
00:42:54.441 --> 00:42:56.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's first on the surface.</v>

1059
00:42:56.590 --> 00:42:57.423
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they can develop a dependence </v>

1060
00:42:58.941 --> 00:42:59.774
<v Speaker 2>mentality of just putting a handout </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they got to get what they can </v>

1061
00:43:03.021 --> 00:43:06.200
<v Speaker 2>get whenever people just show up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blow up and blow out of there.</v>

1062
00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:10.040
<v Speaker 2>But the documentary poverty inc goes in </v>
<v Speaker 2>there and shows how in Haiti,</v>

1063
00:43:10.100 --> 00:43:15.100
<v Speaker 2>they're local farmers have been put out </v>
<v Speaker 2>of business by government subsidies from</v>

1064
00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:17.113
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been to Haiti and I've seen the </v>

1065
00:43:18.081 --> 00:43:22.580
<v Speaker 2>American grown rice that's all just </v>
<v Speaker 2>given out for free or at the markets.</v>

1066
00:43:22.850 --> 00:43:23.683
<v Speaker 2>The people that get it for free then go </v>
<v Speaker 2>to the market and they beat all the </v>

1067
00:43:25.371 --> 00:43:26.204
<v Speaker 2>local farmers because they got it for </v>
<v Speaker 2>free or they played a paid such a small </v>

1068
00:43:29.391 --> 00:43:30.200
<v Speaker 2>price.</v>

1069
00:43:30.200 --> 00:43:31.033
<v Speaker 2>They didn't really do all the work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they're able to beat all their </v>

1070
00:43:32.751 --> 00:43:34.430
<v Speaker 2>competitors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the local market,</v>

1071
00:43:34.431 --> 00:43:35.720
<v Speaker 2>so they get it for free and then they </v>
<v Speaker 2>sell it.</v>

1072
00:43:35.721 --> 00:43:36.554
<v Speaker 2>Is that what you're saying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can at little shops they can do </v>

1073
00:43:37.941 --> 00:43:39.500
<v Speaker 2>that or they just get it and they don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>need it.</v>

1074
00:43:39.530 --> 00:43:40.363
<v Speaker 2>I think it cuts off the local farmers </v>
<v Speaker 2>who are trying to sell their own stuff </v>

1075
00:43:43.041 --> 00:43:44.900
<v Speaker 2>and they can you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>since they're getting it for free,</v>

1076
00:43:44.901 --> 00:43:47.660
<v Speaker 2>they could tell them a much lower price.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

1077
00:43:47.750 --> 00:43:50.960
<v Speaker 2>And it shows it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It dives deep into how,</v>

1078
00:43:51.980 --> 00:43:55.100
<v Speaker 2>how it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how it hurts so much in a way that like,</v>

1079
00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:58.570
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think Haiti's you there,</v>

1080
00:43:58.580 --> 00:44:01.580
<v Speaker 2>they used to eat rice two to three times</v>
<v Speaker 2>a week.</v>

1081
00:44:02.210 --> 00:44:04.790
<v Speaker 2>Now they're eating it three times a day </v>
<v Speaker 2>with breakfast,</v>

1082
00:44:04.791 --> 00:44:05.624
<v Speaker 2>lunch and dinner and they're doing it </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's all the rice that they have </v>

1083
00:44:08.121 --> 00:44:11.750
<v Speaker 2>available to them are from the u s or </v>
<v Speaker 2>from China or from India.</v>

1084
00:44:12.200 --> 00:44:15.800
<v Speaker 2>And it's because these big farmers with </v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of power in the government,</v>

1085
00:44:15.980 --> 00:44:16.813
<v Speaker 2>they're able to make deals with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>United Nations and other places to be </v>

1086
00:44:20.151 --> 00:44:20.984
<v Speaker 2>able to go in and give out their rice </v>
<v Speaker 2>there and they get paid for it from the </v>

1087
00:44:23.151 --> 00:44:24.080
<v Speaker 2>government here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1088
00:44:24.260 --> 00:44:26.330
<v Speaker 2>You government pays these farmers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>

1089
00:44:26.331 --> 00:44:28.040
<v Speaker 2>these prices,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then they go into a community.</v>

1090
00:44:28.041 --> 00:44:31.010
<v Speaker 2>Just give it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now how do I say this in a,</v>

1091
00:44:31.140 --> 00:44:34.860
<v Speaker 2>that it's not bad intentions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one's trying to her.</v>

1092
00:44:34.861 --> 00:44:39.300
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there's these evil people </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to destroy developing nations.</v>

1093
00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:40.433
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's the case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's a model out there that's </v>

1094
00:44:43.321 --> 00:44:47.880
<v Speaker 2>been the traditional model of let's </v>
<v Speaker 2>announce our arrival by throwing,</v>

1095
00:44:48.030 --> 00:44:50.400
<v Speaker 2>throwing a parade.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's throw a big party.</v>

1096
00:44:50.790 --> 00:44:53.340
<v Speaker 2>Let's get a bunch of pictures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1097
00:44:53.550 --> 00:44:54.383
<v Speaker 2>and let's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's leave to the next one because we </v>

1098
00:44:56.971 --> 00:45:00.740
<v Speaker 2>have such a big organization are so many</v>
<v Speaker 2>funds or,</v>

1099
00:45:00.870 --> 00:45:02.370
<v Speaker 2>or a big quota to hit.</v>

1100
00:45:02.430 --> 00:45:04.500
<v Speaker 2>We have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is our goal this year.</v>

1101
00:45:04.530 --> 00:45:08.580
<v Speaker 2>We have this many tally marks to get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we blast in one community and then we</v>

1102
00:45:08.581 --> 00:45:11.910
<v Speaker 2>blow out of there into a new one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't develop relationships with them</v>

1103
00:45:11.911 --> 00:45:12.870
<v Speaker 2>to build,</v>
<v Speaker 2>empower them,</v>

1104
00:45:12.871 --> 00:45:15.780
<v Speaker 2>teach them skills that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that part,</v>

1105
00:45:16.290 --> 00:45:17.123
<v Speaker 2>how do I say it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the answer to poverty isn't </v>

1106
00:45:19.830 --> 00:45:21.120
<v Speaker 2>charity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's opportunity.</v>

1107
00:45:21.750 --> 00:45:24.330
<v Speaker 2>Opportunity is always better than </v>
<v Speaker 2>charity,</v>

1108
00:45:24.360 --> 00:45:25.290
<v Speaker 2>if that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if that makes sense.</v>

1109
00:45:25.291 --> 00:45:28.200
<v Speaker 2>A handout or hand up like the given </v>
<v Speaker 2>Manna fish,</v>

1110
00:45:28.620 --> 00:45:30.960
<v Speaker 2>feed him for a day or teach man a fish,</v>
<v Speaker 2>feed him for a lifetime.</v>

1111
00:45:31.380 --> 00:45:35.670
<v Speaker 2>And so if there's a disaster,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if there's a person with a disability,</v>

1112
00:45:36.030 --> 00:45:39.810
<v Speaker 2>if there's a war or famine than charity </v>
<v Speaker 2>is the solution.</v>

1113
00:45:39.811 --> 00:45:42.420
<v Speaker 2>But there's gotta be an escape plan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's got to be a route out.</v>

1114
00:45:42.750 --> 00:45:44.160
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whenever I went to Haiti,</v>

1115
00:45:44.161 --> 00:45:44.994
<v Speaker 2>it was a year and a half,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two years after the earthquake and the </v>

1116
00:45:47.761 --> 00:45:48.594
<v Speaker 2>tent city,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had had doubled or tripled in size </v>

1117
00:45:50.940 --> 00:45:54.030
<v Speaker 2>because I met a guy there that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying I could,</v>

1118
00:45:54.060 --> 00:45:54.893
<v Speaker 2>I moved out of my apartment which wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>damaged by the earthquake and I get to </v>

1119
00:45:58.621 --> 00:46:00.750
<v Speaker 2>go live at tent city,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rent free.</v>

1120
00:46:01.050 --> 00:46:03.990
<v Speaker 2>I still have my job and I get three </v>
<v Speaker 2>meals a day,</v>

1121
00:46:04.050 --> 00:46:04.741
<v Speaker 2>breakfast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lunch,</v>

1122
00:46:04.741 --> 00:46:06.270
<v Speaker 2>and dinner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have to prepare them,</v>

1123
00:46:06.330 --> 00:46:07.163
<v Speaker 2>I don't have to pay for them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so in these places are always going </v>

1124
00:46:10.471 --> 00:46:14.280
<v Speaker 2>to be giving to that tent city and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually grown in size.</v>

1125
00:46:14.281 --> 00:46:16.470
<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm saving up to buy a house.</v>

1126
00:46:17.370 --> 00:46:19.590
<v Speaker 2>And so it's like if people think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1127
00:46:19.591 --> 00:46:21.840
<v Speaker 2>there's just this disaster,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like man,</v>

1128
00:46:21.841 --> 00:46:24.000
<v Speaker 2>if someone brought in like some </v>
<v Speaker 2>vocational training,</v>

1129
00:46:24.300 --> 00:46:25.133
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's teach these people how to do this </v>

1130
00:46:26.491 --> 00:46:28.920
<v Speaker 2>kind of work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I don't think honestly,</v>

1131
00:46:29.340 --> 00:46:31.020
<v Speaker 2>most sane people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1132
00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:32.513
<v Speaker 2>out there that are living in poverty </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to be poor for the rest of their </v>

1133
00:46:35.011 --> 00:46:35.844
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're sitting there waiting for an </v>

1134
00:46:36.931 --> 00:46:37.764
<v Speaker 2>opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Dad wants to put food on the table </v>

1135
00:46:39.331 --> 00:46:40.590
<v Speaker 2>for the family.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was the mom,</v>

1136
00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:42.030
<v Speaker 2>she wants to take care of her kids.</v>

1137
00:46:42.330 --> 00:46:46.530
<v Speaker 2>And so whenever we can come into a </v>
<v Speaker 2>community and spend time with them,</v>

1138
00:46:46.531 --> 00:46:48.060
<v Speaker 2>if that makes sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like sit down,</v>

1139
00:46:48.061 --> 00:46:49.830
<v Speaker 2>listen to them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>learn from them,</v>

1140
00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:52.680
<v Speaker 2>and then we can say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how can we work together?</v>

1141
00:46:52.890 --> 00:46:53.723
<v Speaker 2>How can we brainstorm?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is your community really need </v>

1142
00:46:55.650 --> 00:47:00.330
<v Speaker 2>instead of treating it like there's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>cookie cutter solution or blueprint that</v>

1143
00:47:00.600 --> 00:47:03.300
<v Speaker 2>since it worked in this community,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to work in that community.</v>

1144
00:47:03.330 --> 00:47:06.720
<v Speaker 2>Or since it worked in this country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to work in that country.</v>

1145
00:47:06.960 --> 00:47:11.040
<v Speaker 2>Like every country has its own culture </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the Congo has over 200 tribes.</v>

1146
00:47:11.100 --> 00:47:14.250
<v Speaker 2>That's over 200 different cultures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so some are going to receive it.</v>

1147
00:47:14.251 --> 00:47:15.180
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some aren't.</v>

1148
00:47:15.450 --> 00:47:16.283
<v Speaker 2>Some how do you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you work with them in a way that </v>

1149
00:47:18.661 --> 00:47:22.170
<v Speaker 2>isn't just coming in and just giving </v>
<v Speaker 2>them stuff that,</v>

1150
00:47:22.230 --> 00:47:25.260
<v Speaker 2>I've seen it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen a riot happened in Uganda.</v>

1151
00:47:25.261 --> 00:47:27.300
<v Speaker 2>It was in ginger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ginger,</v>

1152
00:47:27.301 --> 00:47:30.070
<v Speaker 2>Uganda.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're a organization came in with</v>

1153
00:47:30.070 --> 00:47:33.580
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of canned foods and they did it </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a very poor fashion where,</v>

1154
00:47:33.910 --> 00:47:36.670
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just cracked open this container in</v>

1155
00:47:36.671 --> 00:47:39.730
<v Speaker 1>a slump and it's one of the roughest </v>
<v Speaker 1>slums and Uganda,</v>

1156
00:47:40.180 --> 00:47:42.610
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and people just raided it.</v>

1157
00:47:42.970 --> 00:47:46.450
<v Speaker 1>And it didn't even give probably a </v>
<v Speaker 1>quarter of the people in the slums,</v>

1158
00:47:46.620 --> 00:47:49.570
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a canned item from the u s and so people</v>

1159
00:47:49.571 --> 00:47:52.980
<v Speaker 1>start fighting over it and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting over it and it's a,</v>

1160
00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:54.960
<v Speaker 1>and so we got really hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if they died,</v>

1161
00:47:54.961 --> 00:47:57.280
<v Speaker 1>but someone got really hurt there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We had to get out of there.</v>

1162
00:47:58.240 --> 00:48:01.930
<v Speaker 1>And so what I know from that </v>
<v Speaker 1>organization is,</v>

1163
00:48:01.960 --> 00:48:03.640
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not going to say the </v>
<v Speaker 1>organization,</v>

1164
00:48:03.641 --> 00:48:05.820
<v Speaker 1>but I heard from the other organizations</v>
<v Speaker 1>there that they,</v>

1165
00:48:06.140 --> 00:48:08.440
<v Speaker 1>they had been warned like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're new at this.</v>

1166
00:48:08.470 --> 00:48:09.303
<v Speaker 1>Don't go in there and do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't crack open this container and do </v>

1167
00:48:12.101 --> 00:48:12.934
<v Speaker 1>it that way.</v>

1168
00:48:13.030 --> 00:48:16.660
<v Speaker 1>But they had spent like $20,000 getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>the canned goods there,</v>

1169
00:48:17.080 --> 00:48:18.550
<v Speaker 1>shipping,</v>
<v Speaker 1>buying a container,</v>

1170
00:48:18.580 --> 00:48:21.130
<v Speaker 1>shipping it over there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>going through Kenya,</v>

1171
00:48:21.190 --> 00:48:25.150
<v Speaker 1>then uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then probably Tanzania or Tanzania,</v>

1172
00:48:25.210 --> 00:48:27.100
<v Speaker 1>then Kenya,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then Uganda,</v>

1173
00:48:27.130 --> 00:48:27.963
<v Speaker 1>they're had to pay all the fees </v>
<v Speaker 1>everywhere they go to just go give it </v>

1174
00:48:30.641 --> 00:48:31.474
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That $20,000 could have empowered so </v>

1175
00:48:33.641 --> 00:48:34.474
<v Speaker 1>many farmers locally or people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know how to farm to be able to </v>

1176
00:48:37.751 --> 00:48:40.720
<v Speaker 1>start farming for themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that then is going to have such a better</v>

1177
00:48:40.721 --> 00:48:43.540
<v Speaker 1>return on investment because you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>investing into the people,</v>

1178
00:48:43.541 --> 00:48:45.040
<v Speaker 1>into a trade,</v>
<v Speaker 1>into a skill,</v>

1179
00:48:45.041 --> 00:48:47.470
<v Speaker 1>into something that they need and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to last.</v>

1180
00:48:47.471 --> 00:48:49.240
<v Speaker 1>It's going to continue to produce </v>
<v Speaker 1>results.</v>

1181
00:48:49.270 --> 00:48:50.103
<v Speaker 1>I totally makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think what you're saying is so </v>

1182
00:48:51.551 --> 00:48:53.710
<v Speaker 1>important that these people have great </v>
<v Speaker 1>intentions,</v>

1183
00:48:53.711 --> 00:48:54.544
<v Speaker 1>but that just human nature and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>given the circumstances of which these </v>

1184
00:48:58.091 --> 00:48:58.924
<v Speaker 1>people live in where they had no hope </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then all of sudden they have this </v>

1185
00:49:00.731 --> 00:49:03.370
<v Speaker 1>one thing and it's one thing as gifts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1186
00:49:03.370 --> 00:49:06.520
<v Speaker 1>Far better to do what you're doing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>provide them with opportunity.</v>

1187
00:49:06.550 --> 00:49:07.630
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think that's,</v>

1188
00:49:08.080 --> 00:49:08.913
<v Speaker 1>I mean the issue that I think a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people are going to have with even </v>

1189
00:49:11.711 --> 00:49:16.690
<v Speaker 1>discussing that is the callous </v>
<v Speaker 1>discussions of the welfare mentality.</v>

1190
00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:17.490
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1191
00:49:17.490 --> 00:49:20.320
<v Speaker 1>the way people look at some communities </v>
<v Speaker 1>and people,</v>

1192
00:49:20.321 --> 00:49:20.691
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1193
00:49:20.691 --> 00:49:24.190
<v Speaker 1>the term welfare brats or welfare,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1194
00:49:24.250 --> 00:49:27.550
<v Speaker 1>welfare people that are just kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>like connected to that,</v>

1195
00:49:27.720 --> 00:49:29.260
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the need for charity.</v>

1196
00:49:29.560 --> 00:49:32.090
<v Speaker 1>And I think that mirrors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1197
00:49:32.180 --> 00:49:34.120
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea of welfare and you know,</v>

1198
00:49:34.121 --> 00:49:34.954
<v Speaker 1>when people don't have jobs and don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>have opportunities and just getting </v>

1199
00:49:36.671 --> 00:49:38.320
<v Speaker 1>money and getting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting addicted to that money,</v>

1200
00:49:38.530 --> 00:49:40.810
<v Speaker 1>that problem has existed in America as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

1201
00:49:40.900 --> 00:49:41.733
<v Speaker 1>Obviously it's a much bigger deal in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Congo because you're talking about like </v>

1202
00:49:43.931 --> 00:49:47.020
<v Speaker 1>basic life necessities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fresh water.</v>

1203
00:49:47.470 --> 00:49:48.760
<v Speaker 1>But I think that's important,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1204
00:49:48.760 --> 00:49:50.920
<v Speaker 1>It's important to understand what human </v>
<v Speaker 1>nature,</v>

1205
00:49:50.980 --> 00:49:51.813
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mechanisms of human nature and like </v>

1206
00:49:54.101 --> 00:49:55.870
<v Speaker 1>what you're talking about here is really</v>
<v Speaker 1>powerful.</v>

1207
00:49:56.110 --> 00:49:56.943
<v Speaker 1>There was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have thought it out so well and to </v>

1208
00:49:58.661 --> 00:49:59.494
<v Speaker 1>give these people this opportunity and </v>
<v Speaker 1>now to give these people at this </v>

1209
00:50:00.940 --> 00:50:04.630
<v Speaker 1>opportunity with the soap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean Pacha is doing an awesome job.</v>

1210
00:50:04.660 --> 00:50:05.140
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1211
00:50:05.140 --> 00:50:08.830
<v Speaker 1>that's an amazing thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's so important and I really</v>

1212
00:50:08.831 --> 00:50:12.070
<v Speaker 1>hope that more people listen and more </v>
<v Speaker 1>people hear you and more people say,</v>

1213
00:50:12.071 --> 00:50:13.060
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1214
00:50:13.180 --> 00:50:14.470
<v Speaker 1>I want to get involved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's,</v>

1215
00:50:14.471 --> 00:50:16.060
<v Speaker 1>let's do something else in the Congo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's,</v>

1216
00:50:16.061 --> 00:50:16.894
<v Speaker 1>let's give these people another </v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunity that they can start </v>

1217
00:50:18.581 --> 00:50:19.930
<v Speaker 1>businesses down there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1218
00:50:20.090 --> 00:50:20.923
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like really empower themselves and </v>

1219
00:50:22.091 --> 00:50:22.924
<v Speaker 1>be able to build homes and just like in </v>
<v Speaker 1>your lifetime you could see some crazy </v>

1220
00:50:26.591 --> 00:50:27.640
<v Speaker 1>change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1221
00:50:27.700 --> 00:50:28.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I</v>

1222
00:50:28.090 --> 00:50:29.690
<v Speaker 2>know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that's coming and Congo,</v>

1223
00:50:30.440 --> 00:50:32.270
<v Speaker 2>but I think like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's not,</v>

1224
00:50:32.570 --> 00:50:34.890
<v Speaker 2>let's not set a ceiling or roof on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm not,</v>

1225
00:50:35.060 --> 00:50:36.590
<v Speaker 2>that's what I'm not saying that's what </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're saying,</v>

1226
00:50:36.591 --> 00:50:40.820
<v Speaker 2>but I'm just saying that I truly believe</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the water crisis,</v>

1227
00:50:40.910 --> 00:50:44.240
<v Speaker 2>1 billion people not having clean water </v>
<v Speaker 2>in our lifetime,</v>

1228
00:50:44.270 --> 00:50:46.850
<v Speaker 2>we have the tools,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the technology and people are learning.</v>

1229
00:50:47.180 --> 00:50:48.013
<v Speaker 2>I mean from podcasting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like people were getting better than </v>

1230
00:50:50.661 --> 00:50:51.590
<v Speaker 2>doctorates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>degrees,</v>

1231
00:50:51.591 --> 00:50:53.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like in information and,</v>

1232
00:50:53.331 --> 00:50:54.164
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and life experience and learning and </v>

1233
00:50:55.880 --> 00:50:56.713
<v Speaker 2>learning to do things the right way and </v>
<v Speaker 2>truly have people's best interests at </v>

1234
00:50:59.421 --> 00:51:00.620
<v Speaker 2>heart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1235
00:51:00.800 --> 00:51:02.540
<v Speaker 2>I think there's going to be a real shift</v>
<v Speaker 2>to where,</v>

1236
00:51:02.900 --> 00:51:03.733
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I have,</v>

1237
00:51:03.740 --> 00:51:06.640
<v Speaker 2>if I have the water to take a piss in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1238
00:51:06.740 --> 00:51:09.650
<v Speaker 2>or to water my lawn with or to give my </v>
<v Speaker 2>dog clean water,</v>

1239
00:51:09.890 --> 00:51:10.723
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to be able to give every </v>

1240
00:51:11.331 --> 00:51:12.650
<v Speaker 2>person in the world clean water.</v>

1241
00:51:12.910 --> 00:51:13.743
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's through empowerment and it's </v>

1242
00:51:15.261 --> 00:51:17.990
<v Speaker 2>through opportunity and a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's what I love.</v>

1243
00:51:18.020 --> 00:51:20.030
<v Speaker 2>I even have a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>since it was world water day,</v>

00:57:19.210 --> 00:57:23.920

<v Speaker 2>that knife,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually,</v>

1362
00:57:39.371 --> 00:57:41.380
<v Speaker 2>I have a picture for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If maldon up a,</v>

1363
00:57:41.520 --> 00:57:43.900
<v Speaker 2>a knife.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a made out of a nail.</v>

1364
00:57:43.930 --> 00:57:46.490
<v Speaker 2>It's actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I use this to open up all my letters and</v>

1365
00:57:46.550 --> 00:57:47.830
<v Speaker 2>packages and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1366
00:57:47.831 --> 00:57:48.664
<v Speaker 2>So awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chiefly Leo made both of those for Ya </v>

1367
00:57:51.820 --> 00:57:53.470
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1368
00:57:53.680 --> 00:57:55.660
<v Speaker 2>I think on that little file it says </v>
<v Speaker 2>knife.</v>

1369
00:57:55.720 --> 00:57:56.553
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I actually had a picture I didn't </v>

1370
00:57:58.421 --> 00:58:01.480
<v Speaker 2>get to show you yet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this is how he makes the knives.</v>

1371
00:58:01.870 --> 00:58:02.703
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he just finds the nails out in the </v>

1372
00:58:04.751 --> 00:58:05.584
<v Speaker 2>forest and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some ladders or different things and he </v>

1373
00:58:08.021 --> 00:58:09.310
<v Speaker 2>pulls him out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1374
00:58:09.320 --> 00:58:10.900
<v Speaker 2>think people do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>forcing the rain forest,</v>

1375
00:58:10.901 --> 00:58:13.420
<v Speaker 2>he gets their nails and make some </v>
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>

1376
00:58:13.421 --> 00:58:15.400
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something useful.</v>

1377
00:58:15.520 --> 00:58:18.610
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so that,</v>

1378
00:58:18.640 --> 00:58:19.473
<v Speaker 2>that's a picture of the knife.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there might be one more picture </v>

1379
00:58:21.760 --> 00:58:24.820
<v Speaker 2>of him making the knives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what he's doing is he's taking a nail</v>

1380
00:58:24.821 --> 00:58:29.050
<v Speaker 2>and he's hammering it flat and he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>taking this big spike nail,</v>

1381
00:58:29.051 --> 00:58:29.884
<v Speaker 2>like a construction nail,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a railroad and not quite a </v>

1382

<v Speaker 2>railroad.</v>

00:58:41.441 --> 00:58:41.800
<v Speaker 2>hammer.</v>

1390
00:58:47.470 --> 00:58:49.930
<v Speaker 2>if you pull up the other one that says,</v>

<v Speaker 2>showed the problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's actually one that's with </v>

1407
00:59:28.640 --> 00:59:31.430
<v Speaker 2>transformation or the solution kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>to the problem.</v>

1408
00:59:31.650 --> 00:59:33.620
<v Speaker 2>And that just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that first video just showed the problem</v>

1409

<v Speaker 2>is hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1410
00:59:34.461 --> 00:59:37.000
<v Speaker 2>But then there's hope to see what we can</v>
<v Speaker 2>do something about it.</v>

1413
00:59:47.140 --> 00:59:47.973

01:00:06.200 --> 01:00:08.050
<v Speaker 5>I want to teach my grandson how to hunt.</v>

1417
01:00:15.190 --> 01:00:16.023
<v Speaker 4>We are teaching these young boys this </v>
<v Speaker 4>because this is our original way of </v>

1418
01:00:19.011 --> 01:00:19.844
<v Speaker 4>life.</v>

1419
01:00:21.700 --> 01:00:25.030
<v Speaker 5>One day we'll die,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but these young people will live on.</v>

1420
01:00:32.560 --> 01:00:37.560
<v Speaker 4>I love that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Gorgeous.</v>

1421
01:00:39.320 --> 01:00:42.070
<v Speaker 4>People treat pygmies like we aren't </v>
<v Speaker 4>important about Bob.</v>

1422
01:00:42.740 --> 01:00:47.740
<v Speaker 4>They think we're stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but when we worked on farms,</v>

1423
01:00:51.051 --> 01:00:56.051
<v Speaker 4>we would get 10 or 15 bananas to split </v>
<v Speaker 4>among seven people by Bob tried to start</v>

1424
01:00:58.821 --> 01:01:01.220
<v Speaker 4>a small farm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Someone would take it from me and say,</v>

1425
01:01:01.670 --> 01:01:02.503
<v Speaker 4>your father did not own any land.</v>
<v Speaker 4>2013 Leo may spill at your seat land of </v>

1426
01:01:14.861 --> 01:01:17.080
<v Speaker 4>their own.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's about 247 acres.</v>

1427
01:01:22.580 --> 01:01:23.413
<v Speaker 4>I was happy to have my own lane,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we weren't getting water from the </v>

1428
01:01:26.841 --> 01:01:30.140
<v Speaker 4>river.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was bad or people were sick.</v>

1429
01:01:30.170 --> 01:01:31.003
<v Speaker 4>One day you should get it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but sometimes they would get sick and </v>

1430
01:01:34.941 --> 01:01:39.941
<v Speaker 4>die without treatment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've never heard of anybody getting sick</v>

1431
01:01:59.611 --> 01:02:01.560
<v Speaker 4>from the water since we've had the well </v>
<v Speaker 4>here.</v>

1432
01:02:02.380 --> 01:02:04.760
<v Speaker 4>It's so good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so sweet.</v>

1433
01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.710
<v Speaker 4>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm with the big change is that</v>

1434
01:02:08.090 --> 01:02:13.090
<v Speaker 5>farm before and after the same place?</v>

<v Speaker 4>cassava.</v>

1436
01:02:22.360 --> 01:02:24.120
<v Speaker 4>Then we planted some banana trees.</v>

1437
01:02:25.900 --> 01:02:27.580
<v Speaker 5>Banana trees.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Have you planted that?</v>

1438
01:02:35.830 --> 01:02:39.730
<v Speaker 5>I cannot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a lot.</v>

1439
01:02:41.620 --> 01:02:42.700
<v Speaker 5>I can't finish county.</v>

1440
01:02:56.600 --> 01:03:00.380
<v Speaker 4>What Nissan in his make up the first </v>
<v Speaker 4>time we took bananas to the market,</v>

1441
01:03:00.740 --> 01:03:01.573
<v Speaker 4>we bought clothes for the children.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When we saw them wearing clothes and </v>

1442
01:03:04.701 --> 01:03:06.290
<v Speaker 4>shoes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we were so happy.</v>

1443
01:03:10.550 --> 01:03:14.660
<v Speaker 4>Today we have a toilet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we have a place to wash our hands.</v>

1444
01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:19.960
<v Speaker 4>We have a place to shower.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So to me that's progress,</v>

1445
01:03:24.140 --> 01:03:24.973
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because he made everybody get getting </v>

1446
01:03:36.171 --> 01:03:38.340
<v Speaker 4>erection in generation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Judah,</v>

1447
01:03:38.520 --> 01:03:40.430
<v Speaker 4>we've beat this land.</v>

1448
01:03:45.910 --> 01:03:46.743
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

1449
01:03:47.850 --> 01:03:52.850
<v Speaker 2>And Tans who not just living your whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>life in despair and then all of a sudden</v>

1450
01:03:55.950 --> 01:03:58.840
<v Speaker 2>the last few years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things radically change for the better.</v>

1451
01:03:59.800 --> 01:04:00.910
<v Speaker 2>That's powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1452
01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:04.750
<v Speaker 2>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1453
01:04:05.830 --> 01:04:07.420
<v Speaker 2>What a crazy thing you're doing justin </v>
<v Speaker 2>wren.</v>

1454
01:04:09.370 --> 01:04:10.203
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1455
01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:14.920
<v Speaker 2>to be completely honest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>me and like I got to be the spark plug,</v>

1456
01:04:15.160 --> 01:04:18.160
<v Speaker 2>but man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a big engine around this.</v>

1457
01:04:18.240 --> 01:04:21.010
<v Speaker 2>Oh Hey stan state side water four.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Without a doubt.</v>

1458
01:04:21.011 --> 01:04:23.260
<v Speaker 2>All of our supporters couldn't do </v>
<v Speaker 2>without them,</v>

1459
01:04:24.250 --> 01:04:27.250
<v Speaker 2>but mostly we couldn't do it without the</v>
<v Speaker 2>people on the ground.</v>

1460
01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:28.113
<v Speaker 2>There in the Congo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>18 Congolese people with a heart to </v>

1461
01:04:30.611 --> 01:04:33.280
<v Speaker 2>change be the change in their own </v>
<v Speaker 2>country,</v>

1462
01:04:33.400 --> 01:04:35.080
<v Speaker 2>to change the country from the inside </v>
<v Speaker 2>out,</v>

1463
01:04:35.081 --> 01:04:36.220
<v Speaker 2>countryman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the countryman,</v>

1464
01:04:36.680 --> 01:04:38.530
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not being dependent on others.</v>

1465
01:04:38.531 --> 01:04:39.364
<v Speaker 2>I mean they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're starting to secure water </v>

1466
01:04:40.691 --> 01:04:42.160
<v Speaker 2>contracts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1467
01:04:42.190 --> 01:04:45.040
<v Speaker 2>to drill wells and do water projects in </v>
<v Speaker 2>their own country.</v>

1468
01:04:45.280 --> 01:04:47.080
<v Speaker 2>So that way they don't have to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>dependent on us.</v>

1469
01:04:47.110 --> 01:04:47.943
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our team in Uganda is over 70% self </v>

1470
01:04:50.921 --> 01:04:53.230
<v Speaker 2>sufficient,</v>
<v Speaker 2>self funded inside the country,</v>

1471
01:04:53.560 --> 01:04:56.670
<v Speaker 2>our guys in Congo or close to 50%.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1472
01:04:56.800 --> 01:04:57.633
<v Speaker 2>and we're on track to get these teams to</v>
<v Speaker 2>where they're 100% self sufficient to </v>

1473
01:05:01.361 --> 01:05:04.540
<v Speaker 2>where we just come in with the training </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the techniques and the tools.</v>

1474
01:05:04.810 --> 01:05:07.240
<v Speaker 2>But like they don't need us to fund it </v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>

1475
01:05:07.360 --> 01:05:10.000
<v Speaker 2>So that way we can go off to other </v>
<v Speaker 2>places and do it again.</v>

1476
01:05:10.030 --> 01:05:11.620
<v Speaker 2>Replicated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1477
01:05:11.800 --> 01:05:12.633
<v Speaker 2>So what is the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is there a longterm strategy in terms </v>

1478
01:05:14.921 --> 01:05:16.060
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1479
01:05:16.061 --> 01:05:16.894
<v Speaker 2>so basically things that work in their </v>
<v Speaker 2>context so that way we give them like </v>

1480
01:05:22.241 --> 01:05:23.830
<v Speaker 2>the manual drilling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1481
01:05:24.190 --> 01:05:25.023
<v Speaker 2>one instance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why this Swahili proverb </v>

1482
01:05:26.561 --> 01:05:28.450
<v Speaker 2>just popped in my mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they say,</v>

1483
01:05:28.451 --> 01:05:29.650
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you Americans,</v>

1484
01:05:29.710 --> 01:05:32.500
<v Speaker 2>are you westerners?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You guys all have watched us,</v>

1485
01:05:32.950 --> 01:05:34.180
<v Speaker 2>but we're the ones that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>

1486
01:05:34.240 --> 01:05:35.073
<v Speaker 2>who have time.</v>

1487
01:05:35.680 --> 01:05:36.630
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1488
01:05:37.150 --> 01:05:37.871
<v Speaker 2>does that make sense?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1489
01:05:37.871 --> 01:05:39.850
<v Speaker 2>you guys don't have watches,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we have time.</v>

1490
01:05:40.600 --> 01:05:42.700
<v Speaker 2>And they see us as always rushing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rushing,</v>

1491
01:05:42.701 --> 01:05:43.534
<v Speaker 2>rushing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and trying to get this done and that </v>

1492
01:05:44.681 --> 01:05:45.550
<v Speaker 2>done and this done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're like,</v>

1493
01:05:45.551 --> 01:05:47.470
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's good to go out and crush things and</v>

1494
01:05:47.471 --> 01:05:50.350
<v Speaker 2>get so many goals and so many </v>
<v Speaker 2>accomplishments under your belt,</v>

1495
01:05:50.770 --> 01:05:53.140
<v Speaker 2>but let's make sure we're doing it all </v>
<v Speaker 2>the right way.</v>

1496
01:05:53.200 --> 01:05:54.730
<v Speaker 2>So that's what I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>honestly,</v>

1497
01:05:54.760 --> 01:05:57.250
<v Speaker 2>I've learned from them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Slow it down so you can do it right,</v>

1498
01:05:57.280 --> 01:05:59.350
<v Speaker 2>do it correctly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1499
01:05:59.530 --> 01:06:02.590
<v Speaker 2>I've even started implement that into my</v>
<v Speaker 2>lifting and in training,</v>

1500
01:06:02.591 --> 01:06:03.424
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like slow things down to a slow </v>

1501
01:06:04.961 --> 01:06:05.794
<v Speaker 2>controlled and do it correctly instead </v>
<v Speaker 2>of just trying to put up a bunch of </v>

1502
01:06:08.321 --> 01:06:09.690
<v Speaker 2>white.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1503
01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:11.290
<v Speaker 2>and so they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1504
01:06:11.300 --> 01:06:13.600
<v Speaker 2>they slow things down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1505
01:06:13.890 --> 01:06:14.410
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1506
01:06:14.410 --> 01:06:15.243
<v Speaker 2>and honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the longterm solution is reason why we </v>

1507
01:06:18.281 --> 01:06:19.720
<v Speaker 2>don't take volunteers anymore.</v>

1508
01:06:20.110 --> 01:06:20.943
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I've only taken two people with me </v>

1509
01:06:22.541 --> 01:06:23.920
<v Speaker 2>to the Congo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1510
01:06:23.950 --> 01:06:27.790
<v Speaker 2>but they were Geo hydrologist or </v>
<v Speaker 2>engineers that needed to come.</v>

1511
01:06:28.180 --> 01:06:29.700
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the reason is,</v>

1512
01:06:29.701 --> 01:06:32.200
<v Speaker 2>is because when you take volunteers </v>
<v Speaker 2>over,</v>

1513
01:06:32.590 --> 01:06:35.980
<v Speaker 2>most of them are going to be amateurs or</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to be white belts.</v>

1514
01:06:36.010 --> 01:06:39.580
<v Speaker 2>If I had to put it into a mma or Bjj </v>
<v Speaker 2>analogy,</v>

1515
01:06:39.970 --> 01:06:41.980
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and our guys in the field,</v>

1516
01:06:41.981 --> 01:06:42.814
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're becoming black belts where they </v>

1517
01:06:44.051 --> 01:06:47.440
<v Speaker 2>are now after years of training,</v>
<v Speaker 2>years of development on this,</v>

1518
01:06:47.620 --> 01:06:49.870
<v Speaker 2>since 2011,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1519
01:06:50.620 --> 01:06:52.300
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our guys in Congo,</v>

1520
01:06:52.301 --> 01:06:54.820
<v Speaker 2>I've drilled those 62 wells,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they went to Sierra Leone.</v>

1521
01:06:55.060 --> 01:06:57.460
<v Speaker 2>They taught a team in Cameroon from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ground up.</v>

1522
01:06:57.790 --> 01:06:59.560
<v Speaker 2>They went to Uganda,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kenya,</v>

1523
01:06:59.650 --> 01:07:02.740
<v Speaker 2>and Rwanda.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're,</v>

1524
01:07:02.741 --> 01:07:03.574
<v Speaker 2>these teams are working together and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going off after they learn how </v>

1525
01:07:05.801 --> 01:07:06.634
<v Speaker 2>to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to other communities in </v>

1526
01:07:07.781 --> 01:07:10.270
<v Speaker 2>their own country or they're going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>another country.</v>

1527
01:07:10.540 --> 01:07:13.630
<v Speaker 2>It's so cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have this dynamic going on between,</v>

1528
01:07:13.660 --> 01:07:14.493
<v Speaker 2>we call it the Varunga initiative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's the Virunga mountains that are </v>

1529
01:07:17.561 --> 01:07:20.470
<v Speaker 2>on the border of Uganda,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rwanda and Congo.</v>

1530
01:07:21.430 --> 01:07:23.470
<v Speaker 2>Now there's so many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1531
01:07:23.500 --> 01:07:25.040
<v Speaker 2>rebel groups,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1532
01:07:25.060 --> 01:07:26.610
<v Speaker 2>that are there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1533
01:07:27.010 --> 01:07:27.843
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the w those countries I've been at </v>

1534
01:07:29.441 --> 01:07:30.274
<v Speaker 2>war against each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the people from those nations </v>

1535
01:07:33.131 --> 01:07:33.964
<v Speaker 2>pretty much hate each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they all blame the one another for </v>

1536
01:07:38.080 --> 01:07:39.730
<v Speaker 2>you guys are doing this in our country </v>
<v Speaker 2>and your rebel,</v>

1537
01:07:39.731 --> 01:07:40.564
<v Speaker 2>you're sending rebels into our country </v>
<v Speaker 2>and where your government soldiers are </v>

1538
01:07:42.851 --> 01:07:43.684
<v Speaker 2>actually pretending to be rebels,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're working for the government </v>

1539
01:07:45.281 --> 01:07:46.720
<v Speaker 2>and they're stealing our golden her </v>
<v Speaker 2>diamonds.</v>

1540
01:07:46.721 --> 01:07:48.130
<v Speaker 2>And anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they,</v>

1541
01:07:48.880 --> 01:07:49.713
<v Speaker 2>they don't work together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But now our well drillers that are from </v>

1542
01:07:52.241 --> 01:07:56.650
<v Speaker 2>Rwanda and Uganda and Congo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're all working so much together.</v>

1543
01:07:56.651 --> 01:07:59.080
<v Speaker 2>We get everything in from Uganda.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1544
01:07:59.170 --> 01:08:00.610
<v Speaker 2>our team goes to co,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1545
01:08:00.670 --> 01:08:03.370
<v Speaker 2>Rwanda from Congo to teach them how to </v>
<v Speaker 2>train,</v>

1546
01:08:03.580 --> 01:08:07.720
<v Speaker 2>but that Rwandan team comes over to us </v>
<v Speaker 2>and teaches us business principles.</v>

1547
01:08:08.170 --> 01:08:11.560
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so it's just been so cool to see how</v>

1548
01:08:11.561 --> 01:08:12.394
<v Speaker 2>they're working together and how are </v>
<v Speaker 2>guys in Congo or holding Ugandan and </v>

1549
01:08:17.031 --> 01:08:17.864
<v Speaker 2>Rwandan flags over their back taking </v>
<v Speaker 2>pictures and the other guys are wearing </v>

1550
01:08:21.320 --> 01:08:22.153
<v Speaker 2>Congo flags over their back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And our team that came from Uganda to </v>

1551
01:08:25.161 --> 01:08:25.994
<v Speaker 2>live with me for three months in our </v>
<v Speaker 2>team to help us really get off the </v>

1552
01:08:28.431 --> 01:08:29.264
<v Speaker 2>ground and start learning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had drilled over 100 wells for </v>

1553
01:08:32.480 --> 01:08:33.313
<v Speaker 2>their fellow Ugandans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They left for three months to come live </v>

1554
01:08:35.751 --> 01:08:38.670
<v Speaker 2>with us in Congo there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First Day there they,</v>

1555
01:08:38.680 --> 01:08:39.950
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the car flipped,</v>

1556
01:08:39.980 --> 01:08:43.310
<v Speaker 2>their taxi driver flipped a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the car ran over,</v>

1557
01:08:43.311 --> 01:08:44.144
<v Speaker 2>a woman killed her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't speak the Congolese Swahili </v>

1558
01:08:47.030 --> 01:08:49.850
<v Speaker 2>or French there from an English speaking</v>
<v Speaker 2>nation and Uganda.</v>

1559
01:08:51.350 --> 01:08:54.800
<v Speaker 2>And all of a sudden they had the car was</v>
<v Speaker 2>looted,</v>

1560
01:08:54.920 --> 01:08:56.710
<v Speaker 2>it was torched.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1561
01:08:57.230 --> 01:09:00.920
<v Speaker 2>and people were chasing them down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wanting to put tires around them and set</v>

1562
01:09:00.921 --> 01:09:03.680
<v Speaker 2>them on fire and burned them and kill </v>
<v Speaker 2>them because they were Ugandan.</v>

1563
01:09:03.920 --> 01:09:04.753
<v Speaker 2>They got in an accident.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the whole mob justice kind of </v>

1564
01:09:06.860 --> 01:09:09.590
<v Speaker 2>mentality that happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if,</v>

1565
01:09:09.740 --> 01:09:12.170
<v Speaker 2>if they send them to the jail or court,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they know that,</v>

1566
01:09:12.530 --> 01:09:13.363
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>justice probably won't be had if they </v>

1567
01:09:15.051 --> 01:09:16.790
<v Speaker 2>have money on them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

1568
01:09:16.791 --> 01:09:18.740
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people just want justice.</v>

1569
01:09:18.741 --> 01:09:20.930
<v Speaker 2>Then it's kind of wild over there and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1570
01:09:21.260 --> 01:09:22.093
<v Speaker 2>and that area of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So these Ugandan guys literally knew </v>

1571
01:09:24.171 --> 01:09:25.004
<v Speaker 2>they're risking their lives to come live</v>
<v Speaker 2>with us in Congo just because they're </v>

1572
01:09:27.321 --> 01:09:28.154
<v Speaker 2>hated by Congolese.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then whenever they flipped their </v>

1573
01:09:30.021 --> 01:09:31.250
<v Speaker 2>vehicle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first day,</v>

1574
01:09:31.251 --> 01:09:33.920
<v Speaker 2>they're there on the border,</v>
<v Speaker 2>basically still of Uganda.</v>

1575
01:09:34.370 --> 01:09:38.420
<v Speaker 2>They're in a town called Nica,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which means snake and they hit a lady,</v>

1576
01:09:38.480 --> 01:09:39.313
<v Speaker 2>it killed her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was the taxi driver drive and </v>

1577
01:09:41.660 --> 01:09:42.493
<v Speaker 2>he's not part of our team.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then they all wanted to kill the </v>

1578
01:09:44.841 --> 01:09:46.790
<v Speaker 2>Ugandan guys inside of the Congolese </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy.</v>

1579
01:09:47.300 --> 01:09:50.210
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then they still stuck it out.</v>

1580
01:09:50.420 --> 01:09:54.230
<v Speaker 2>We're able to regain our $15,000 a well </v>
<v Speaker 2>drilling equipment that was there.</v>

1581
01:09:54.500 --> 01:09:55.570
<v Speaker 2>Luckily we had a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1582
01:09:55.640 --> 01:09:58.280
<v Speaker 2>this is a side topic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we had this,</v>

1583
01:09:58.281 --> 01:09:59.114
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this water filtration system that was </v>

1584
01:10:01.971 --> 01:10:04.490
<v Speaker 2>from solar panels and they had these two</v>
<v Speaker 2>big chambers on it.</v>

1585
01:10:04.491 --> 01:10:05.324
<v Speaker 2>And in the middle is this timer that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>literally twist and it goes for an hour </v>

1586
01:10:08.271 --> 01:10:10.850
<v Speaker 2>and has a green and red light on it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it ticks tick,</v>

1587
01:10:10.851 --> 01:10:11.211
<v Speaker 2>tick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tick,</v>

1588
01:10:11.211 --> 01:10:12.044
<v Speaker 2>tick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tick.</v>

1589
01:10:12.080 --> 01:10:12.913
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we had it locked up whenever it came </v>

1590
01:10:13.851 --> 01:10:16.520
<v Speaker 2>from the states and our Ugandan team </v>
<v Speaker 2>picked it up and they go,</v>

1591
01:10:16.521 --> 01:10:21.260
<v Speaker 2>hey the the something called Tsa broke </v>
<v Speaker 2>off the lock and left you a note.</v>

1592
01:10:21.650 --> 01:10:22.483
<v Speaker 2>And so they are checking it cause it </v>
<v Speaker 2>looked like these two chambers and a </v>

1593
01:10:24.111 --> 01:10:27.320
<v Speaker 2>timer and it looked like it could've </v>
<v Speaker 2>been a bomb in this big Pelican case.</v>

1594
01:10:28.580 --> 01:10:31.040
<v Speaker 2>So whenever the Congolese guys loaded </v>
<v Speaker 2>the car,</v>

1595
01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:31.993
<v Speaker 2>set it on fire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they ran away with it and hid behind a </v>

1596
01:10:34.131 --> 01:10:35.180
<v Speaker 2>hut.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1597
01:10:35.300 --> 01:10:37.280
<v Speaker 2>well whenever they opened that Pelican </v>
<v Speaker 2>case,</v>

1598
01:10:37.310 --> 01:10:38.143
<v Speaker 2>all of a sudden they thought it was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>bomb and they ran away and left all of </v>

1599
01:10:40.641 --> 01:10:41.474
<v Speaker 2>our stuff there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So whenever they found out that these </v>

1600
01:10:43.580 --> 01:10:44.413
<v Speaker 2>guys from Uganda already risked their </v>
<v Speaker 2>lives to come here and teach Congolese </v>

1601
01:10:48.260 --> 01:10:51.410
<v Speaker 2>how to drill wells for themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were truly good guys.</v>

1602
01:10:51.411 --> 01:10:52.244
<v Speaker 2>It was just an accident.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They got behind us and let us back to </v>

1603
01:10:56.270 --> 01:10:58.910
<v Speaker 2>our equipment and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be careful though.</v>

1604
01:10:58.940 --> 01:11:00.800
<v Speaker 2>Like that bond,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why we left it out there.</v>

1605
01:11:00.890 --> 01:11:03.920
<v Speaker 2>So they understood that it was a big </v>
<v Speaker 2>misunderstanding.</v>

1606
01:11:03.950 --> 01:11:04.783
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a big misunderstanding that </v>

1607
01:11:05.430 --> 01:11:07.070
<v Speaker 2>forgave those people for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gave them for,</v>

1608
01:11:07.090 --> 01:11:09.860
<v Speaker 2>gave our Ugandan well drillers who </v>
<v Speaker 2>weren't even really a part of it.</v>

1609
01:11:09.861 --> 01:11:12.020
<v Speaker 2>There was the taxi driver that actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>hit,</v>

1610
01:11:12.050 --> 01:11:12.883
<v Speaker 2>did they apologize for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to stick tires around them and light </v>

1611
01:11:14.611 --> 01:11:15.360
<v Speaker 2>them on fire?</v>

1612
01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:16.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

1613
01:11:17.070 --> 01:11:17.903
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1614
01:11:17.910 --> 01:11:19.200
<v Speaker 2>so anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a long story.</v>

1615
01:11:19.201 --> 01:11:20.034
<v Speaker 2>It was crazy wild and we thought our </v>
<v Speaker 2>guys are going to die because we were </v>

1616
01:11:21.871 --> 01:11:25.650
<v Speaker 2>like six hours away from him and we were</v>
<v Speaker 2>hearing like a Ryan basically happening.</v>

1617
01:11:26.210 --> 01:11:28.410
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was so cool man,</v>

1618
01:11:28.411 --> 01:11:29.244
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1619
01:11:29.400 --> 01:11:31.980
<v Speaker 2>that we got all our supplies back and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then afterwards,</v>

1620
01:11:32.030 --> 01:11:33.060
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we,</v>

1621
01:11:34.340 --> 01:11:35.290
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we gave,</v>

1622
01:11:35.610 --> 01:11:39.120
<v Speaker 2>we helped with the burial process and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the funeral and everything else.</v>

1623
01:11:39.150 --> 01:11:40.950
<v Speaker 2>Even though it was the taxi driver,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not us.</v>

1624
01:11:40.951 --> 01:11:42.780
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we felt so bad that that had happened.</v>

1625
01:11:43.470 --> 01:11:44.700
<v Speaker 2>But then to know like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1626
01:11:45.210 --> 01:11:46.980
<v Speaker 2>now it was just a story that we were </v>
<v Speaker 2>able to,</v>

1627
01:11:47.050 --> 01:11:47.610
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>

1628
01:11:47.610 --> 01:11:48.960
<v Speaker 2>not that loss of life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1629
01:11:49.230 --> 01:11:51.490
<v Speaker 2>but those people now know that we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>here to help them.</v>

1630
01:11:52.080 --> 01:11:53.880
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we were able to go back in there and</v>

1631
01:11:53.881 --> 01:11:55.050
<v Speaker 2>do that for them afterwards.</v>

1632
01:11:55.080 --> 01:11:57.510
<v Speaker 2>So it's amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1633
01:11:57.540 --> 01:11:58.373
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know there's a book that a Loretta </v>

1634
01:12:02.130 --> 01:12:03.030
<v Speaker 2>Hunt wrote with you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1635
01:12:03.760 --> 01:12:06.780
<v Speaker 2>But you've lived another life since the </v>
<v Speaker 2>book.</v>

1636
01:12:06.900 --> 01:12:07.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1637
01:12:07.950 --> 01:12:09.120
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have another books,</v>

1638
01:12:09.121 --> 01:12:10.210
<v Speaker 2>life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1639
01:12:10.270 --> 01:12:10.951
<v Speaker 2>books,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1640
01:12:10.951 --> 01:12:12.570
<v Speaker 2>life's worth of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the word?</v>

1641
01:12:12.780 --> 01:12:15.270
<v Speaker 2>Way To describe it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Another easily another book.</v>

1642
01:12:15.450 --> 01:12:16.800
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well thanks.</v>

1643
01:12:17.480 --> 01:12:18.313
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what I love about me and these </v>

1644
01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:22.020
<v Speaker 2>short films.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's all part of the documentary.</v>

1645
01:12:22.470 --> 01:12:23.550
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in fact,</v>

1646
01:12:23.551 --> 01:12:24.384
<v Speaker 2>maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1647
01:12:24.390 --> 01:12:27.720
<v Speaker 2>I should probably say that like after I </v>
<v Speaker 2>was on the second or third time here,</v>

1648
01:12:27.750 --> 01:12:28.583
<v Speaker 2>we did a kickstarter for the documentary</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we got it fully funded yet the </v>

1649
01:12:32.131 --> 01:12:34.920
<v Speaker 2>documentary is not out yet because we're</v>
<v Speaker 2>going back one more time,</v>

1650
01:12:34.990 --> 01:12:36.570
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to film a,</v>

1651
01:12:36.580 --> 01:12:38.850
<v Speaker 2>they'll probably be July or August right</v>
<v Speaker 2>after my fight.</v>

1652
01:12:38.851 --> 01:12:39.684
<v Speaker 2>We'll bust over there and we're trying </v>
<v Speaker 2>to submit it to sundance film festival </v>

1653
01:12:42.451 --> 01:12:43.080
<v Speaker 2>this year.</v>

1654
01:12:43.080 --> 01:12:47.790
<v Speaker 2>We submit it in September.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hopefully we get in the festival.</v>

1655
01:12:48.120 --> 01:12:48.953
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it will be there in January and then it </v>

1656
01:12:50.601 --> 01:12:51.434
<v Speaker 2>will be out in a lot of the gre </v>
<v Speaker 2>supporters that gave to the kickstarter </v>

1657
01:12:53.851 --> 01:12:56.760
<v Speaker 2>will be able to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we really wanted to do the story,</v>

1658
01:12:56.790 --> 01:12:59.660
<v Speaker 2>not the story when do the pygmies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1659
01:12:59.760 --> 01:13:03.960
<v Speaker 2>in their family in and everyone's </v>
<v Speaker 2>suffering for the world from the world's</v>

1660
01:13:03.961 --> 01:13:04.794
<v Speaker 2>water crisis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We wanted to do them justice to give </v>

1661
01:13:07.321 --> 01:13:09.840
<v Speaker 2>them a voice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The book was me giving them a voice,</v>

1662
01:13:10.200 --> 01:13:12.210
<v Speaker 2>but the documentary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to have their own voice.</v>

1663
01:13:12.570 --> 01:13:13.403
<v Speaker 2>And so it's been so cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's been filmed over three and a half </v>

1664
01:13:14.791 --> 01:13:16.110
<v Speaker 2>years now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think when it comes out,</v>

1665
01:13:16.290 --> 01:13:17.123
<v Speaker 2>there'll be a four full years that </v>
<v Speaker 2>Derek's been able to go back and forth </v>

1666
01:13:20.521 --> 01:13:24.390
<v Speaker 2>and go get more of the story and show </v>
<v Speaker 2>not just like them getting water for the</v>

1667
01:13:24.391 --> 01:13:26.610
<v Speaker 2>first time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then also how we're giving jobs,</v>

1668
01:13:26.611 --> 01:13:29.100
<v Speaker 2>how they're getting trained,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how they're starting up workshops,</v>

1669
01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:30.113
<v Speaker 2>how we're breaking ground on the soa </v>
<v Speaker 2>production facility where already have </v>

1670
01:13:32.641 --> 01:13:33.060
<v Speaker 2>the land.</v>

1671
01:13:33.060 --> 01:13:35.490
<v Speaker 2>We started the foundation of the place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1672
01:13:35.880 --> 01:13:36.713
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so how it's the full spectrum of it </v>

1673
01:13:38.911 --> 01:13:42.990
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to hopefully show how empowerment,</v>

1674
01:13:43.230 --> 01:13:45.450
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much farther that goes.</v>

1675
01:13:45.480 --> 01:13:47.940
<v Speaker 2>Now it's a lot tougher.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It takes a lot more time.</v>

1676
01:13:48.210 --> 01:13:53.120
<v Speaker 2>You really have to be strategic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to sit and listen and learn and</v>

1677
01:13:53.130 --> 01:13:55.860
<v Speaker 2>be humble enough to say like it's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>learning process.</v>

1678
01:13:55.861 --> 01:13:56.694
<v Speaker 2>Like when you do something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whenever you get out of that lane of </v>

1679
01:14:01.050 --> 01:14:04.380
<v Speaker 2>truly listening and saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's,</v>

1680
01:14:05.190 --> 01:14:07.500
<v Speaker 2>that's the quote that our team tries to </v>
<v Speaker 2>live by.</v>

1681
01:14:08.070 --> 01:14:10.830
<v Speaker 2>It's a swahili proverb that says if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to go fast,</v>

1682
01:14:10.960 --> 01:14:14.380
<v Speaker 2>go alone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you want to go far go together.</v>

1683
01:14:15.340 --> 01:14:18.370
<v Speaker 2>And so it's like how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how can every community we go in,</v>

1684
01:14:18.550 --> 01:14:19.383
<v Speaker 2>how can we take this as far as we can </v>
<v Speaker 2>not go as fast as we can because if we </v>

1685
01:14:22.751 --> 01:14:24.760
<v Speaker 2>want to go fast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we just leave them out of it.</v>

1686
01:14:25.570 --> 01:14:27.520
<v Speaker 2>But if we want to go far,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll go together.</v>

1687
01:14:27.580 --> 01:14:29.080
<v Speaker 2>And so we do that with our well drilling</v>
<v Speaker 2>team,</v>

1688
01:14:29.110 --> 01:14:29.943
<v Speaker 2>but we do that with the communities too </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they all lived like a saying </v>

1689
01:14:32.501 --> 01:14:35.050
<v Speaker 2>that that's just ingrained in them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1690
01:14:35.770 --> 01:14:37.990
<v Speaker 2>Do you have a long term strategy with </v>
<v Speaker 2>this?</v>

1691
01:14:37.991 --> 01:14:39.730
<v Speaker 2>Like do you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you see yourself,</v>

1692
01:14:39.731 --> 01:14:40.564
<v Speaker 2>like how long do you see yourself </v>
<v Speaker 2>fighting and what do you see yourself </v>

1693
01:14:42.521 --> 01:14:45.280
<v Speaker 2>doing after you're done with that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1694
01:14:45.520 --> 01:14:50.470
<v Speaker 2>I think I'm going to fight for the next </v>
<v Speaker 2>five to seven years.</v>

1695
01:14:50.900 --> 01:14:51.701
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1696
01:14:51.701 --> 01:14:53.470
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I can go out on top,</v>

1697
01:14:53.471 --> 01:14:55.270
<v Speaker 2>I'd love to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1698
01:14:55.570 --> 01:14:57.790
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I need to carry it too </v>
<v Speaker 2>long,</v>

1699
01:14:57.791 --> 01:15:01.760
<v Speaker 2>too far and go out on a bad note of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>string of brutal losses.</v>

1700
01:15:01.780 --> 01:15:03.250
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

1701
01:15:03.251 --> 01:15:05.620
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to get that platform when you get</v>

1702
01:15:05.621 --> 01:15:06.440
<v Speaker 2>to the top.</v>

1703
01:15:06.440 --> 01:15:07.273
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then I want to delete and go do </v>

1704
01:15:09.461 --> 01:15:10.630
<v Speaker 2>something else and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1705
01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:12.700
<v Speaker 2>which is this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But man,</v>

1706
01:15:12.790 --> 01:15:13.623
<v Speaker 2>it's been so cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Our team and Sierra Leone and our team </v>

1707
01:15:15.221 --> 01:15:16.770
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1708
01:15:16.870 --> 01:15:19.420
<v Speaker 2>Kenya and now we're about to do it in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Rwanda.</v>

1709
01:15:19.450 --> 01:15:22.600
<v Speaker 2>We did this like crowdfunding campaign </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we threw up on world water day.</v>

1710
01:15:22.640 --> 01:15:23.920
<v Speaker 2>We're doing it through the rest of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>month.</v>

1711
01:15:24.460 --> 01:15:26.980
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we have started water towers.</v>

1712
01:15:27.130 --> 01:15:30.160
<v Speaker 2>So basically we drill a well and then we</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a water tower,</v>

1713
01:15:30.190 --> 01:15:34.750
<v Speaker 2>which turns into a water kiosk where </v>
<v Speaker 2>people from the community come up to it.</v>

1714
01:15:34.870 --> 01:15:37.570
<v Speaker 2>They might pay pay five shillings for </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jerry Cam.</v>

1715
01:15:38.410 --> 01:15:39.850
<v Speaker 2>So jerry cans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>five gallons,</v>

1716
01:15:39.851 --> 01:15:40.684
<v Speaker 2>they pay 5 cents,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but eventually all the people in the </v>

1717
01:15:42.581 --> 01:15:44.320
<v Speaker 2>community,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the one in Rwanda we're doing,</v>

1718
01:15:44.350 --> 01:15:47.050
<v Speaker 2>it's going to serve 4,000 people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's at a school.</v>

1719
01:15:47.051 --> 01:15:49.690
<v Speaker 2>So the kids will have clean water all </v>
<v Speaker 2>throughout the day,</v>

1720
01:15:50.170 --> 01:15:53.920
<v Speaker 2>but then people come there and the one </v>
<v Speaker 2>in Kenya is funding a school,</v>

1721
01:15:54.130 --> 01:15:56.500
<v Speaker 2>but the one in Rwanda is going to fund </v>
<v Speaker 2>more water wells.</v>

1722
01:15:56.710 --> 01:16:00.400
<v Speaker 2>So as these people by clean water,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the only clean water around there,</v>

1723
01:16:00.610 --> 01:16:02.410
<v Speaker 2>that community,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the only thing they have to drink,</v>

1724
01:16:02.411 --> 01:16:04.280
<v Speaker 2>there's a lake that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1725
01:16:04.780 --> 01:16:07.750
<v Speaker 2>has the cows and everything else </v>
<v Speaker 2>drinking out of it.</v>

1726
01:16:08.170 --> 01:16:09.003
<v Speaker 2>Cow patties are inside the water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you can see people collecting water </v>

1727
01:16:12.581 --> 01:16:14.980
<v Speaker 2>at the same time that cows are drinking </v>
<v Speaker 2>from it right beside them.</v>

1728
01:16:15.490 --> 01:16:16.940
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people washing clothes in it,</v>

1729
01:16:16.960 --> 01:16:18.910
<v Speaker 2>they're washing motorcycles in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1730
01:16:18.930 --> 01:16:22.450
<v Speaker 2>and then that's their drinking water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so we're putting up this water kiosk</v>

1731
01:16:22.451 --> 01:16:23.284
<v Speaker 2>where yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to charge him 5 cents when </v>

1732
01:16:24.341 --> 01:16:25.174
<v Speaker 2>they get five gallons of clean water,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but those are going to turn into </v>

1733
01:16:27.191 --> 01:16:28.930
<v Speaker 2>multiple water wells throughout the </v>
<v Speaker 2>year.</v>

1734
01:16:29.410 --> 01:16:30.243
<v Speaker 2>And so we're trying to do all these </v>
<v Speaker 2>sustainable solutions to where after we </v>

1735
01:16:32.111 --> 01:16:34.630
<v Speaker 2>do that in Rwanda,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're taking that to the Congo,</v>

1736
01:16:34.690 --> 01:16:35.523
<v Speaker 2>there'll be close to the soa production </v>
<v Speaker 2>facility in the community development </v>

1737
01:16:38.111 --> 01:16:38.350
<v Speaker 2>center.</v>

1738
01:16:38.350 --> 01:16:40.030
<v Speaker 2>We're going to have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which will have land,</v>

1739
01:16:40.031 --> 01:16:41.350
<v Speaker 2>water,</v>
<v Speaker 2>food solutions,</v>

1740
01:16:41.780 --> 01:16:43.240
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even the forestry,</v>

1741
01:16:43.510 --> 01:16:46.750
<v Speaker 2>what we felt to replant over 4,000 trees</v>
<v Speaker 2>now in the Congo.</v>

1742
01:16:47.170 --> 01:16:48.640
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because of deforestation,</v>

1743
01:16:48.641 --> 01:16:49.474
<v Speaker 2>so brutal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think it's just sitting back and </v>

1744
01:16:50.801 --> 01:16:51.940
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you guys need?</v>

1745
01:16:52.240 --> 01:16:53.980
<v Speaker 2>Listening and learning that need and </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>

1746
01:16:54.190 --> 01:16:55.270
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where can we fit in?</v>

1747
01:16:55.540 --> 01:16:58.270
<v Speaker 2>How can we help in this area?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who's a specialist?</v>

1748
01:16:58.570 --> 01:17:02.560
<v Speaker 2>How can we really make an impact?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think our lame is definitely water.</v>

1749
01:17:02.590 --> 01:17:06.490
<v Speaker 2>I mean from that chiefly Omi village or </v>
<v Speaker 2>the story that you just saw,</v>

1750
01:17:06.750 --> 01:17:08.740
<v Speaker 2>but bofi where he made that knife for </v>
<v Speaker 2>Ya.</v>

1751
01:17:09.230 --> 01:17:10.063
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can see that water changes </v>

1752
01:17:12.081 --> 01:17:14.870
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that's going to be what hubs,</v>

1753
01:17:15.230 --> 01:17:16.130
<v Speaker 2>that's our hub,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

1754
01:17:16.160 --> 01:17:18.980
<v Speaker 2>that's our lane and that's what all of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the waterfall teams are doing.</v>

1755
01:17:20.150 --> 01:17:20.983
<v Speaker 2>But in the Congo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because of the pygmies are so </v>

1756
01:17:22.281 --> 01:17:23.114
<v Speaker 2>vulnerable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're trying to find the ways to help </v>

1757
01:17:24.321 --> 01:17:24.920
<v Speaker 2>them come up.</v>

1758
01:17:24.920 --> 01:17:25.753
<v Speaker 2>And as they come up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>other people are watching and looking </v>

1759
01:17:27.321 --> 01:17:29.630
<v Speaker 2>and they're starting to implement the </v>
<v Speaker 2>same kind of things.</v>

1760
01:17:30.080 --> 01:17:34.160
<v Speaker 2>So it's pretty cool to see that happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And before I forget,</v>

1761
01:17:34.310 --> 01:17:37.100
<v Speaker 2>the reason I wanted to show that video </v>
<v Speaker 2>was I got you something.</v>

1762
01:17:37.101 --> 01:17:38.990
<v Speaker 2>This is Leo [inaudible] wife.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you have the,</v>

1763
01:17:39.320 --> 01:17:41.660
<v Speaker 2>you have the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the knife from Leo May,</v>

1764
01:17:42.170 --> 01:17:43.003
<v Speaker 2>his wife made you this right here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so because from our second jre </v>

1765
01:17:49.431 --> 01:17:50.450
<v Speaker 2>episode,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe,</v>

1766
01:17:50.690 --> 01:17:54.440
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we funded a water well there in Bofi and</v>

1767
01:17:54.441 --> 01:17:55.160
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1768
01:17:55.160 --> 01:17:57.510
<v Speaker 2>she's really talented.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1769
01:17:58.130 --> 01:18:00.410
<v Speaker 2>I mean it might not look like too much </v>
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>

1770
01:18:00.411 --> 01:18:01.400
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's cool.</v>

1771
01:18:01.401 --> 01:18:03.560
<v Speaker 2>What does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's bark cloth.</v>

1772
01:18:03.740 --> 01:18:04.573
<v Speaker 2>So it's a tree bark cloth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when they take the bark off the </v>

1773
01:18:07.011 --> 01:18:07.880
<v Speaker 2>trees,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fine.</v>

1774
01:18:09.050 --> 01:18:09.883
<v Speaker 2>But they a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that used to be what they would make </v>

1775
01:18:10.851 --> 01:18:11.684
<v Speaker 2>their clothing out of their clothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would make other materials out of </v>

1776
01:18:14.880 --> 01:18:15.713
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

1777
01:18:15.880 --> 01:18:16.713
<v Speaker 2>They can make these little kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>carrying cases or backpacks kind of out </v>

1778
01:18:19.221 --> 01:18:20.054
<v Speaker 2>of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did they treat it with something like </v>

1779
01:18:21.321 --> 01:18:22.154
<v Speaker 2>how do they get it so soft?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They pound it down and I haven't seen </v>

1780
01:18:24.621 --> 01:18:25.454
<v Speaker 2>the whole process,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I've seen the bark and where they </v>

1781
01:18:26.871 --> 01:18:31.871
<v Speaker 2>pull it off and then they kind of beat </v>
<v Speaker 2>it down and beat it down until it's this</v>

1782
01:18:31.881 --> 01:18:32.714
<v Speaker 2>like cloth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that this right here when I've </v>

1783
01:18:34.551 --> 01:18:37.280
<v Speaker 2>been doing research,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have those pygmy,</v>

1784
01:18:37.340 --> 01:18:40.220
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>boothy pygmy paintings that are made out</v>

1785
01:18:40.221 --> 01:18:43.520
<v Speaker 2>of bark cloth at Lake Card,</v>
<v Speaker 2>National Museum of history in New York.</v>

1786
01:18:43.840 --> 01:18:44.673
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have a few of these there and so </v>

<v Speaker 2>I actually didn't think to or I didn't </v>

1801
01:19:12.411 --> 01:19:14.300

<v Speaker 2>painting this one,</v>

1802
01:19:14.600 --> 01:19:16.190
<v Speaker 2>but I got a picture of her doing some </v>
<v Speaker 2>other ones.</v>

1803
01:19:17.210 --> 01:19:21.410
<v Speaker 2>That's a Mamma Swazi and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's pretty great at it as well.</v>

<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's a little bowl.</v>

1806
01:19:25.821 --> 01:19:27.050
<v Speaker 2>We'll leafs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1807
01:19:27.110 --> 01:19:29.150
<v Speaker 2>this paint that you actually have there </v>
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>

1808
01:19:29.210 --> 01:19:30.043
<v Speaker 2>they had some leftover black paint,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but sometimes on that other photo they </v>

1809
01:19:33.891 --> 01:19:38.450
<v Speaker 2>just use like cassava or berries and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they beat it up a pound it down and make</v>

1810
01:19:38.451 --> 01:19:41.090
<v Speaker 2>this paint out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it kind of fades over time.</v>

1811
01:19:41.630 --> 01:19:43.100
<v Speaker 2>So this one's one where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1812
01:19:43.220 --> 01:19:44.053
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's it right there where they just </v>

1813
01:19:46.220 --> 01:19:48.500
<v Speaker 2>pound up the stuff and it's part of </v>
<v Speaker 2>their culture.</v>

1814
01:19:48.501 --> 01:19:49.334
<v Speaker 2>It's what they love to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They kind of how he saw Leo may a pass </v>

1815
01:19:51.871 --> 01:19:52.790
<v Speaker 2>him down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1816
01:19:53.210 --> 01:19:54.043
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the farming and that video was actually </v>

1817
01:19:55.520 --> 01:19:58.220
<v Speaker 2>San g over here from the hand print </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1818
01:19:58.221 --> 01:20:01.130
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he got his grandson.</v>

1819
01:20:01.410 --> 01:20:02.243
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is what the women pass down to </v>

1820
01:20:03.231 --> 01:20:05.960
<v Speaker 2>their girls is how to make the spark </v>
<v Speaker 2>cloth and how to,</v>

1821
01:20:06.410 --> 01:20:07.620
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how to paint.</v>

1822
01:20:07.860 --> 01:20:08.160
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

1823
01:20:08.160 --> 01:20:09.390
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty neat.</v>

1824
01:20:09.391 --> 01:20:11.910
<v Speaker 1>Their culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they just do everything together.</v>

1825
01:20:12.480 --> 01:20:14.970
<v Speaker 1>They rally around each other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're happy together.</v>

1826
01:20:14.971 --> 01:20:15.840
<v Speaker 1>They sing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they dance,</v>

1827
01:20:15.841 --> 01:20:18.260
<v Speaker 1>but they also suffer together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If one person,</v>

1828
01:20:18.270 --> 01:20:20.430
<v Speaker 1>the community is lost,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even for instance,</v>

1829
01:20:20.950 --> 01:20:25.560
<v Speaker 1>it might sound weird in our culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but let's say a mother passes away who's</v>

1830
01:20:25.760 --> 01:20:26.460
<v Speaker 1>dear?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1831
01:20:26.460 --> 01:20:27.750
<v Speaker 1>she's breastfeeding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1832
01:20:27.780 --> 01:20:30.150
<v Speaker 1>And she passes away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the baby survives.</v>

1833
01:20:30.330 --> 01:20:31.163
<v Speaker 1>Some other woman in the village will </v>
<v Speaker 1>take the baby up and start taking care </v>

1834
01:20:34.141 --> 01:20:35.770
<v Speaker 1>of that little one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

1835
01:20:35.850 --> 01:20:39.210
<v Speaker 1>there is an adoption in the pygmy </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture like you do.</v>

1836
01:20:39.300 --> 01:20:40.133
<v Speaker 1>No one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one needs to be adopted because the </v>

1837
01:20:41.851 --> 01:20:44.460
<v Speaker 1>community rallies around them when </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone's lost,</v>

1838
01:20:44.490 --> 01:20:45.323
<v Speaker 1>they all mourn the death together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then they rally around that family </v>

1839
01:20:47.881 --> 01:20:50.790
<v Speaker 1>and see how they can all help and put </v>
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>

1840
01:20:50.791 --> 01:20:52.920
<v Speaker 1>So it's pretty cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love it.</v>

1841
01:20:52.921 --> 01:20:54.000
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've learned a lot from him.</v>

1842
01:20:54.060 --> 01:20:55.350
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how people used to be,</v>

1843
01:20:55.351 --> 01:20:56.184
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

1844
01:20:56.250 --> 01:21:00.750
<v Speaker 1>that's the original sort of tribal life </v>
<v Speaker 1>of human beings.</v>

1845
01:21:00.780 --> 01:21:02.430
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would all raise each other.</v>

1846
01:21:02.431 --> 01:21:04.680
<v Speaker 1>Christopher Ryan had this whole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1847
01:21:05.520 --> 01:21:07.740
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take on it in sex at dawn,</v>

1848
01:21:07.760 --> 01:21:08.593
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Mckenna had a take on it as well </v>

1849
01:21:11.270 --> 01:21:14.310
<v Speaker 1>where they were talking about these </v>
<v Speaker 1>ancient cultures.</v>

1850
01:21:14.311 --> 01:21:17.220
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of these small groups of people,</v>

1851
01:21:17.221 --> 01:21:21.090
<v Speaker 1>they were much closer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They knew everyone in the community.</v>

1852
01:21:21.091 --> 01:21:23.750
<v Speaker 1>It was intensely important and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1853
01:21:23.820 --> 01:21:24.653
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of people that think that </v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the problems that we deal with </v>

1854
01:21:25.951 --> 01:21:26.784
<v Speaker 1>today in society are because of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>association that we have with our </v>

1855
01:21:29.071 --> 01:21:29.904
<v Speaker 1>neighbors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we don't have a real sense of </v>

1856
01:21:31.381 --> 01:21:32.101
<v Speaker 1>community.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1857
01:21:32.101 --> 01:21:35.640
<v Speaker 1>I know like two or three of my neighbors</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I see them once a year and I say,</v>

1858
01:21:35.641 --> 01:21:37.320
<v Speaker 1>hi wave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how's everything man?</v>

1859
01:21:37.321 --> 01:21:37.860
<v Speaker 1>Everything cool.</v>

1860
01:21:37.860 --> 01:21:38.850
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good seeing Ya.</v>

1861
01:21:38.880 --> 01:21:39.720
<v Speaker 1>But that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1862
01:21:39.750 --> 01:21:42.030
<v Speaker 1>there's no real community,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no interaction.</v>

1863
01:21:42.031 --> 01:21:44.550
<v Speaker 1>There's no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's certainly no contribution as far</v>

1864
01:21:44.551 --> 01:21:47.850
<v Speaker 1>as like working together together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>food or water or anything like that.</v>

1865
01:21:47.851 --> 01:21:49.920
<v Speaker 1>And I would imagine that these people </v>
<v Speaker 1>were,</v>

1866
01:21:49.921 --> 01:21:51.710
<v Speaker 1>it just intensely close.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1867
01:21:51.810 --> 01:21:52.643
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that must've been a big part of </v>

1868
01:21:54.091 --> 01:21:54.924
<v Speaker 1>the attraction to you to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when they took you in and you were </v>

1869
01:21:58.381 --> 01:22:00.660
<v Speaker 1>living with them and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1870
01:22:00.690 --> 01:22:01.523
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1871
01:22:01.560 --> 01:22:05.310
<v Speaker 1>I think the average my booty pygmy </v>
<v Speaker 1>village is only 85,</v>

1872
01:22:05.311 --> 01:22:09.990
<v Speaker 1>250 on our 10 villages that we help and </v>
<v Speaker 1>have the 3000 acres of land.</v>

1873
01:22:10.360 --> 01:22:11.670
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's over 300,</v>

1874
01:22:11.920 --> 01:22:13.320
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for rich each village.</v>

1875
01:22:14.040 --> 01:22:16.080
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you know about Dunbar's number?</v>

1876
01:22:16.950 --> 01:22:20.550
<v Speaker 1>Dunbar's number is a number that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it varies,</v>

1877
01:22:20.551 --> 01:22:23.070
<v Speaker 1>but the number,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere around one 50 for most people,</v>

1878
01:22:23.100 --> 01:22:26.070
<v Speaker 1>there's a number of people that you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>keep close relationships with.</v>

1879
01:22:26.100 --> 01:22:26.933
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They really only have room for 150 </v>

1880
01:22:28.681 --> 01:22:30.870
<v Speaker 1>people in your head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You essentially of hard drive space.</v>

1881
01:22:30.930 --> 01:22:31.920
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1882
01:22:31.950 --> 01:22:32.783
<v Speaker 1>And that seems to be related to ancient </v>
<v Speaker 1>tribal communities that people sense </v>

1883
01:22:38.310 --> 01:22:41.180
<v Speaker 1>that we'd developed that way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we develop these,</v>

1884
01:22:41.260 --> 01:22:43.950
<v Speaker 1>these small groups of 50 to 150 plus </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

1885
01:22:44.020 --> 01:22:45.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when you get larger than that,</v>

1886
01:22:45.481 --> 01:22:46.650
<v Speaker 1>things get weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1887
01:22:46.800 --> 01:22:47.101
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1888
01:22:47.101 --> 01:22:47.940
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's so true.</v>

1889
01:22:47.941 --> 01:22:48.774
<v Speaker 1>Like I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whenever I went through the six year </v>

1890
01:22:51.661 --> 01:22:54.450
<v Speaker 1>battle with oxy and just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1891
01:22:54.870 --> 01:22:56.370
<v Speaker 1>narcotics or pain pills,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I,</v>

1892
01:22:56.371 --> 01:22:57.204
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1893
01:22:58.050 --> 01:22:58.883
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would always be able to isolate super </v>

1894
01:23:01.321 --> 01:23:02.071
<v Speaker 1>easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1895
01:23:02.071 --> 01:23:03.180
<v Speaker 1>Cause as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're in your home,</v>

1896
01:23:03.181 --> 01:23:04.820
<v Speaker 1>you're completely alone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1897
01:23:05.230 --> 01:23:06.010
<v Speaker 1>and so</v>

1898
01:23:06.010 --> 01:23:06.843
<v Speaker 2>it's different when you're in a village </v>
<v Speaker 2>and with the pygmies you saw some of </v>

1899
01:23:10.481 --> 01:23:11.350
<v Speaker 2>those huts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>

1900
01:23:11.620 --> 01:23:13.280
<v Speaker 2>how small they are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1901
01:23:13.840 --> 01:23:16.360
<v Speaker 2>seriously in several of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whenever I'm sleeping,</v>

1902
01:23:16.420 --> 01:23:19.450
<v Speaker 2>I have to sleep in the center and I have</v>
<v Speaker 2>to have my feet out the door.</v>

1903
01:23:19.620 --> 01:23:20.980
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's so small.</v>

1904
01:23:21.400 --> 01:23:23.080
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

1905
01:23:23.081 --> 01:23:23.914
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the only go in there when you're going </v>

1906
01:23:26.351 --> 01:23:27.184
<v Speaker 2>to sleep or if you're not feeling good </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you need some rest or the sun's </v>

1907
01:23:30.461 --> 01:23:32.270
<v Speaker 2>right over your head and in your hot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1908
01:23:32.320 --> 01:23:35.290
<v Speaker 2>but besides that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're cooking your kitchens outside.</v>

1909
01:23:35.650 --> 01:23:37.570
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's where the people is.</v>

1910
01:23:37.571 --> 01:23:40.240
<v Speaker 2>That's where you do life is outside of </v>
<v Speaker 2>your home.</v>

1911
01:23:40.530 --> 01:23:42.010
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>around the campfire.</v>

1912
01:23:42.040 --> 01:23:42.873
<v Speaker 2>We call it campfire university because </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's where we've been taken to school </v>

1913
01:23:46.150 --> 01:23:47.470
<v Speaker 2>from the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the pygmies.</v>

1914
01:23:47.760 --> 01:23:48.271
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1915
01:23:48.271 --> 01:23:51.460
<v Speaker 2>it's where they teach us the most about </v>
<v Speaker 2>life is around the campfire,</v>

1916
01:23:51.461 --> 01:23:54.580
<v Speaker 2>learning their culture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>learning about their kids,</v>

1917
01:23:54.880 --> 01:23:57.850
<v Speaker 2>learning about the hunts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>learning about how they make this,</v>

1918
01:23:57.851 --> 01:23:59.320
<v Speaker 2>make that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1919
01:23:59.440 --> 01:24:00.970
<v Speaker 2>and it's where you get to do life </v>
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>

1920
01:24:01.030 --> 01:24:03.730
<v Speaker 2>And so it's something really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really cool.</v>

1921
01:24:03.880 --> 01:24:04.713
<v Speaker 2>Honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I told him they want to know a little </v>

1922
01:24:06.911 --> 01:24:07.744
<v Speaker 2>bit about my life and I told him that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>went through drug addiction for six </v>

1923
01:24:09.971 --> 01:24:10.804
<v Speaker 2>years and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't really struggle with that at </v>

1924
01:24:13.931 --> 01:24:14.621
<v Speaker 2>all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1925
01:24:14.621 --> 01:24:15.454
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then I told him I got really </v>

1926
01:24:16.751 --> 01:24:19.000
<v Speaker 2>depressed and I told him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really said,</v>

1927
01:24:19.500 --> 01:24:20.333
<v Speaker 2>and I told him that I got so sad that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>decided one time to take as many pills </v>

1928
01:24:23.711 --> 01:24:26.830
<v Speaker 2>as I could and drink.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1929
01:24:26.890 --> 01:24:29.110
<v Speaker 2>there's like half a bottle of everclear </v>
<v Speaker 2>or more.</v>

1930
01:24:29.680 --> 01:24:30.513
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and snorted a bunch of coke and just </v>

1931
01:24:32.651 --> 01:24:33.730
<v Speaker 2>wanted to end it all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1932
01:24:33.731 --> 01:24:37.130
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I told him that I was suicidal and um,</v>

1933
01:24:37.450 --> 01:24:38.510
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1934
01:24:38.920 --> 01:24:43.920
<v Speaker 2>I will never forget how they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how they looked at me almost dumbfounded</v>

1935
01:24:44.710 --> 01:24:46.660
<v Speaker 2>in a way of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then,</v>

1936
01:24:46.690 --> 01:24:49.150
<v Speaker 2>and then one of the questions the chief </v>
<v Speaker 2>asked me said,</v>

1937
01:24:49.570 --> 01:24:50.830
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't hurting you.</v>

1938
01:24:51.270 --> 01:24:52.960
<v Speaker 2>You're set.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wouldn't hurting yourself,</v>

1939
01:24:52.990 --> 01:24:55.060
<v Speaker 2>only hurt you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1940
01:24:55.061 --> 01:24:57.940
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the whole concept of,</v>

1941
01:24:58.540 --> 01:24:59.373
<v Speaker 2>I guess what I'm getting to is they had </v>
<v Speaker 2>never heard of anyone killing </v>

1942
01:25:01.331 --> 01:25:02.164
<v Speaker 2>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like maybe they had heard stories or </v>

1943
01:25:04.541 --> 01:25:05.374
<v Speaker 2>something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they have never known anybody that </v>

1944
01:25:06.851 --> 01:25:08.530
<v Speaker 2>actually killed themselves or heard of </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1945
01:25:08.740 --> 01:25:10.510
<v Speaker 2>It's not something that they or their </v>
<v Speaker 2>community,</v>

1946
01:25:10.511 --> 01:25:13.060
<v Speaker 2>their culture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the pygmies kind of untouched out in the</v>

1947
01:25:13.061 --> 01:25:16.510
<v Speaker 2>forest or even not a up in the city.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1948
01:25:16.570 --> 01:25:18.220
<v Speaker 2>that's just something that they don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>struggle with.</v>

1949
01:25:18.221 --> 01:25:19.054
<v Speaker 2>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're struggling so much day in and </v>

1950
01:25:20.530 --> 01:25:21.363
<v Speaker 2>day out with struggles that are so deep </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they see their family and they do </v>

1951
01:25:25.061 --> 01:25:28.780
<v Speaker 2>life together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That I think they just have so much more</v>

1952
01:25:28.781 --> 01:25:29.614
<v Speaker 2>of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>W W we were just talking about so much </v>

1953
01:25:30.551 --> 01:25:33.460
<v Speaker 2>more of a support system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People that were rally around them.</v>

1954
01:25:33.550 --> 01:25:37.210
<v Speaker 2>When you lose a family member,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone rallies around you.</v>

1955
01:25:37.630 --> 01:25:39.610
<v Speaker 2>Like whenever I go to the funerals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the,</v>

1956
01:25:40.030 --> 01:25:40.863
<v Speaker 2>it's the worst thing in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The sounds like people don't try to </v>

1957
01:25:43.841 --> 01:25:44.674
<v Speaker 2>compose themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't try to dress the body real </v>

1958
01:25:48.071 --> 01:25:53.020
<v Speaker 2>nice and f flowers all around and now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now losing loss of life is always tough.</v>

1959
01:25:53.021 --> 01:25:55.190
<v Speaker 2>Always terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1960
01:25:55.540 --> 01:25:58.390
<v Speaker 2>but there's something we do here in our </v>
<v Speaker 2>culture where we make it,</v>

1961
01:25:58.750 --> 01:26:00.610
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>try to make it as,</v>

1962
01:26:00.670 --> 01:26:04.730
<v Speaker 2>as nice or smooth or almost pretty as </v>
<v Speaker 2>possible.</v>

1963
01:26:04.731 --> 01:26:06.650
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the person's dressed really nice and has</v>

1964
01:26:06.651 --> 01:26:09.230
<v Speaker 2>the flowers and you compose yourself to </v>
<v Speaker 2>come there.</v>

1965
01:26:09.231 --> 01:26:12.230
<v Speaker 2>You gather yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you prepare the eulogy,</v>

1966
01:26:12.530 --> 01:26:14.480
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a program.</v>

1967
01:26:14.510 --> 01:26:17.540
<v Speaker 2>When you step in there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people get handed something and you know</v>

1968
01:26:17.541 --> 01:26:20.450
<v Speaker 2>what's going to happen there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you kind of can all compose,</v>

1969
01:26:20.810 --> 01:26:22.310
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are just so ugly.</v>

1970
01:26:22.370 --> 01:26:24.590
<v Speaker 2>It's so raw.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so real.</v>

1971
01:26:24.980 --> 01:26:25.813
<v Speaker 2>And it's so like in your face and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>just rips your heart open to where </v>

1972
01:26:29.210 --> 01:26:29.950
<v Speaker 2>people are mourning.</v>

1973
01:26:29.950 --> 01:26:31.270
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw Jayla,</v>

1974
01:26:31.460 --> 01:26:34.640
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whenever Babo I was the one,</v>

1975
01:26:34.641 --> 01:26:37.100
<v Speaker 2>me and ben were the ones that told Jayla</v>
<v Speaker 2>while he's the chief.</v>

1976
01:26:37.760 --> 01:26:39.920
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about his grandson passing away.</v>

1977
01:26:40.220 --> 01:26:42.260
<v Speaker 2>We were there when it happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wasn't around,</v>

1978
01:26:42.261 --> 01:26:45.170
<v Speaker 2>he was out collecting or gathering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1979
01:26:45.440 --> 01:26:46.273
<v Speaker 2>and we met on the same path together and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he saw it in our face that he knew Baba </v>

1980
01:26:50.001 --> 01:26:51.980
<v Speaker 2>was sick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but now he knew that he was gone.</v>

1981
01:26:52.580 --> 01:26:57.580
<v Speaker 2>And I remember Jay Lodge is falling on </v>
<v Speaker 2>his back into this,</v>

1982
01:26:58.070 --> 01:27:01.010
<v Speaker 2>off the side of the foot path into like </v>
<v Speaker 2>this pile of brush,</v>

1983
01:27:01.580 --> 01:27:02.413
<v Speaker 2>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1984
01:27:02.720 --> 01:27:03.553
<v Speaker 2>like probably two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three foot tall where he like sunk into </v>

1985
01:27:05.601 --> 01:27:08.090
<v Speaker 2>it and he was just squirming on his </v>
<v Speaker 2>back,</v>

1986
01:27:08.091 --> 01:27:08.924
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's like in his sixties and he's </v>

1987
01:27:10.191 --> 01:27:11.024
<v Speaker 2>watched so many of his grandchildren </v>
<v Speaker 2>like pass just because they don't have </v>

1988
01:27:14.391 --> 01:27:15.224
<v Speaker 2>clean water and seeing them squirming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost wanting to like crawl out of his </v>

1989
01:27:17.781 --> 01:27:18.890
<v Speaker 2>skin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1990
01:27:19.310 --> 01:27:20.900
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so,</v>

1991
01:27:20.901 --> 01:27:24.080
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to be a bummer.</v>

1992
01:27:24.100 --> 01:27:24.500
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

1993
01:27:24.500 --> 01:27:25.333
<v Speaker 2>I'm just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1994
01:27:25.370 --> 01:27:26.950
<v Speaker 2>just express yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1995
01:27:27.350 --> 01:27:30.470
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then how the whole community,</v>

1996
01:27:30.500 --> 01:27:31.970
<v Speaker 2>all hundred and 50,</v>
<v Speaker 2>200,</v>

1997
01:27:31.971 --> 01:27:34.240
<v Speaker 2>300 people that were there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1998
01:27:34.280 --> 01:27:37.340
<v Speaker 2>all mourned together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we shared it.</v>

1999
01:27:37.341 --> 01:27:39.620
<v Speaker 2>Like I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I cried in a way that was like,</v>

2000
01:27:40.880 --> 01:27:41.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2001
01:27:41.470 --> 01:27:42.303
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like wiping my tears with everybody </v>

2002
01:27:43.851 --> 01:27:47.330
<v Speaker 2>because everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone was morning,</v>

2003
01:27:47.331 --> 01:27:49.490
<v Speaker 2>everyone was crying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't just a few people.</v>

2004
01:27:49.491 --> 01:27:51.950
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't just his mom and his dad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his mom,</v>

2005
01:27:51.951 --> 01:27:56.951
<v Speaker 2>macho w it wasn't just j Lajuan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was the whole village cried together.</v>

2006
01:27:58.670 --> 01:28:00.020
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

2007
01:28:00.021 --> 01:28:00.854
<v Speaker 2>but for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2008
01:28:01.550 --> 01:28:05.210
<v Speaker 2>that makes it seem like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if this,</v>

2009
01:28:05.211 --> 01:28:06.044
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to make too many </v>
<v Speaker 2>connections between our culture because </v>

2010
01:28:08.181 --> 01:28:10.100
<v Speaker 2>they're completely different or a lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>different.</v>

2011
01:28:10.101 --> 01:28:14.810
<v Speaker 2>But I think here a huge cause of divorce</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the loss of a child.</v>

2012
01:28:15.410 --> 01:28:17.960
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there,</v>

2013
01:28:18.770 --> 01:28:22.100
<v Speaker 2>it's almost unites the parents.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2014
01:28:22.910 --> 01:28:25.760
<v Speaker 2>so much so whenever they lose a little </v>
<v Speaker 2>one.</v>

2015
01:28:25.790 --> 01:28:27.500
<v Speaker 2>And I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't mean to make this comparison,</v>

2016
01:28:27.501 --> 01:28:30.170
<v Speaker 2>but it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's because when they mourn,</v>

2017
01:28:30.500 --> 01:28:31.333
<v Speaker 2>they truly go to the depths of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>darkest place and they're able to truly </v>

2018
01:28:36.830 --> 01:28:38.870
<v Speaker 2>almost get it out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if that makes sense.</v>

2019
01:28:38.960 --> 01:28:42.770
<v Speaker 2>Where when you're at the funeral,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you let yourself go.</v>

2020
01:28:43.160 --> 01:28:45.980
<v Speaker 2>You just let go and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2021
01:28:46.160 --> 01:28:48.920
<v Speaker 2>and it's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>However ugly or however you handle it,</v>

2022
01:28:49.280 --> 01:28:51.710
<v Speaker 2>whatever emotions come,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just ride that wave,</v>

2023
01:28:51.740 --> 01:28:52.573
<v Speaker 2>if that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that because their life is </v>

2024
01:28:55.130 --> 01:28:55.963
<v Speaker 2>so difficult,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that life itself becomes more precious </v>

2025
01:28:58.521 --> 01:29:01.500
<v Speaker 2>and the loss becomes more powerful or </v>
<v Speaker 2>more intense?</v>

2026
01:29:01.501 --> 01:29:02.130
<v Speaker 2>More,</v>

2027
01:29:02.130 --> 01:29:02.963
<v Speaker 1>more raw?</v>

2028
01:29:03.050 --> 01:29:04.730
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2029
01:29:04.731 --> 01:29:07.700
<v Speaker 2>I needed you to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to sum that up for sure.</v>

2030
01:29:07.790 --> 01:29:10.250
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes I do.</v>

2031
01:29:10.280 --> 01:29:13.190
<v Speaker 2>I think whenever you struggle so much </v>
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

2032
01:29:13.191 --> 01:29:14.024
<v Speaker 2>you become so much more appreciative and</v>
<v Speaker 2>grateful of life of every breath you </v>

2033
01:29:17.001 --> 01:29:18.570
<v Speaker 2>take.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2034
01:29:19.940 --> 01:29:20.773
<v Speaker 2>well that's kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2035
01:29:20.780 --> 01:29:23.960
<v Speaker 1>connected to their lack of understanding</v>
<v Speaker 1>of suicide because our,</v>

2036
01:29:24.500 --> 01:29:27.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our idea of what a difficult life is,</v>

2037
01:29:27.770 --> 01:29:32.120
<v Speaker 1>it's difficult,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's food and shelter and this,</v>

2038
01:29:32.180 --> 01:29:33.013
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and really the easiest place to live in </v>

2039
01:29:34.761 --> 01:29:36.950
<v Speaker 1>the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all those things connected.</v>

2040
01:29:38.180 --> 01:29:39.380
<v Speaker 2>Whereas with them</v>

2041
01:29:40.090 --> 01:29:44.860
<v Speaker 1>just staying alive is such a struggle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And getting water,</v>

2042
01:29:44.861 --> 01:29:46.420
<v Speaker 1>which is so easy for us all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

2043
01:29:46.421 --> 01:29:49.000
<v Speaker 1>anybody can walk into any bathroom and </v>
<v Speaker 1>any gas stop,</v>

2044
01:29:49.300 --> 01:29:50.860
<v Speaker 1>turn the water on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>water comes out.</v>

2045
01:29:50.861 --> 01:29:51.694
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody waters on hard to get in </v>

2046
01:29:52.421 --> 01:29:54.430
<v Speaker 1>America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And even with the droughts,</v>

2047
01:29:54.431 --> 01:29:55.264
<v Speaker 1>it's easy to get water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We water fucking golf courses with </v>

2048
01:29:57.521 --> 01:29:59.430
<v Speaker 1>millions of gallons of water every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2049
01:30:00.550 --> 01:30:03.490
<v Speaker 1>Our understanding of what a struggle is </v>
<v Speaker 1>is so different.</v>

2050
01:30:04.060 --> 01:30:05.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think whenever we,</v>

2051
01:30:05.590 --> 01:30:08.740
<v Speaker 2>when we've really struggled here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can go hide away and we don't have to</v>

2052
01:30:08.741 --> 01:30:09.574
<v Speaker 2>deal with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I have to have conversations about </v>

2053
01:30:10.841 --> 01:30:12.100
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2054
01:30:13.450 --> 01:30:15.310
<v Speaker 2>we can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can almost escape it.</v>

2055
01:30:15.370 --> 01:30:17.620
<v Speaker 2>We can escape it with our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with our toys,</v>

2056
01:30:17.650 --> 01:30:19.000
<v Speaker 2>with our technology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2057
01:30:19.001 --> 01:30:19.834
<v Speaker 2>we can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can just bury our face in our phone </v>

2058
01:30:21.281 --> 01:30:23.740
<v Speaker 2>or a computer or sit and watch a movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like,</v>

2059
01:30:23.741 --> 01:30:26.020
<v Speaker 2>whenever those uncomfortable feelings </v>
<v Speaker 2>come up,</v>

2060
01:30:26.410 --> 01:30:30.580
<v Speaker 2>we can try to ignore them or suppress </v>
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>

2061
01:30:30.760 --> 01:30:32.980
<v Speaker 2>if that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're there.</v>

2062
01:30:32.981 --> 01:30:35.080
<v Speaker 2>So it's almost,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

2063
01:30:35.081 --> 01:30:38.740
<v Speaker 2>this is going to be a weird,</v>
<v Speaker 2>strange curve ball or left turn.</v>

2064
01:30:39.130 --> 01:30:39.963
<v Speaker 2>But it's almost like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've started floating recently and </v>

2065
01:30:42.550 --> 01:30:44.230
<v Speaker 2>whenever I go in there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2066
01:30:44.470 --> 01:30:46.270
<v Speaker 2>into the tank,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like you have to,</v>

2067
01:30:46.720 --> 01:30:48.820
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're left alone to your thoughts,</v>

2068
01:30:48.821 --> 01:30:50.350
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't have that technology.</v>

2069
01:30:50.350 --> 01:30:51.183
<v Speaker 2>You don't have this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you can deal with stuff and you </v>

2070
01:30:53.531 --> 01:30:57.790
<v Speaker 2>can try to focus and let go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And for me it's been really beneficial.</v>

2071
01:30:57.820 --> 01:30:58.653
<v Speaker 2>And so I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that sounds weird for me to make </v>

2072
01:31:00.881 --> 01:31:02.170
<v Speaker 2>that connection,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

2073
01:31:02.800 --> 01:31:06.010
<v Speaker 2>but whenever you're just left alone with</v>
<v Speaker 2>your own thoughts,</v>

2074
01:31:06.250 --> 01:31:09.580
<v Speaker 2>you can go deep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I feel like our culture here,</v>

2075
01:31:09.880 --> 01:31:10.713
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2076
01:31:10.900 --> 01:31:13.660
<v Speaker 2>if we compare,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I love our culture,</v>

2077
01:31:13.661 --> 01:31:14.494
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying there's so much wrong </v>

2078
01:31:15.131 --> 01:31:15.964
<v Speaker 2>with it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

2079
01:31:16.840 --> 01:31:19.390
<v Speaker 2>but I feel like they're in </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationships.</v>

2080
01:31:19.420 --> 01:31:23.050
<v Speaker 2>You go an inch or two wide and you go a </v>
<v Speaker 2>mile deep in the Congo,</v>

2081
01:31:23.110 --> 01:31:28.030
<v Speaker 2>you get to know people and then hear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of times you go a mile wide,</v>

2082
01:31:28.810 --> 01:31:30.910
<v Speaker 2>but you go only,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you only scratched the surface.</v>

2083
01:31:30.911 --> 01:31:33.040
<v Speaker 2>You don't go beneath the top soil that </v>
<v Speaker 2>much.</v>

2084
01:31:33.480 --> 01:31:34.900
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you do sometimes with,</v>

2085
01:31:34.901 --> 01:31:36.580
<v Speaker 2>with a few people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2086
01:31:36.640 --> 01:31:38.980
<v Speaker 2>there's only few people that we trust </v>
<v Speaker 2>with that,</v>

2087
01:31:38.981 --> 01:31:40.840
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's almost like they're,</v>

2088
01:31:40.841 --> 01:31:43.990
<v Speaker 2>everyone's so open to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2089
01:31:44.320 --> 01:31:47.260
<v Speaker 2>to go in deep with one another.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And because of that,</v>

2090
01:31:47.261 --> 01:31:50.770
<v Speaker 2>you get to know each other better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get to a truly hurt when they hurt,</v>

2091
01:31:50.800 --> 01:31:51.970
<v Speaker 2>you get to laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When they laugh,</v>

2092
01:31:51.971 --> 01:31:54.280
<v Speaker 2>you get to cry when they cry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2093
01:31:54.790 --> 01:31:57.640
<v Speaker 2>and I may not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have to keep going on about it,</v>

2094
01:31:57.641 --> 01:32:00.070
<v Speaker 2>but no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>please to don't apologize.</v>

2095
01:32:00.400 --> 01:32:01.860
<v Speaker 1>There's a real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2096
01:32:02.200 --> 01:32:03.033
<v Speaker 1>there's a real argument for the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way that we live right now is not a </v>

2097
01:32:06.521 --> 01:32:07.354
<v Speaker 1>way that we were designed for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meaning that not that it can't be </v>

2098
01:32:09.941 --> 01:32:10.774
<v Speaker 1>sustainable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are manageable and you can't figure out </v>

2099
01:32:12.161 --> 01:32:15.250
<v Speaker 1>a way to live a harmonious life in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>modern context,</v>

2100
01:32:15.640 --> 01:32:18.130
<v Speaker 1>but that a lot of people think that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're just,</v>

2101
01:32:18.310 --> 01:32:19.143
<v Speaker 1>we would naturally fit right in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a tribal environment that it would </v>

2102
01:32:21.881 --> 01:32:24.760
<v Speaker 1>feel natural.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of people experience that when</v>

2103
01:32:24.761 --> 01:32:25.594
<v Speaker 1>they go camping for long stretches of </v>
<v Speaker 1>time when they're out in the woods </v>

2104
01:32:28.060 --> 01:32:28.721
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2105
01:32:28.721 --> 01:32:29.554
<v Speaker 1>for whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just decided to find a place and </v>

2106
01:32:32.411 --> 01:32:33.400
<v Speaker 1>live off the land.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2107
01:32:33.401 --> 01:32:35.860
<v Speaker 1>that's why I think a lot of those shows </v>
<v Speaker 1>like those,</v>

2108
01:32:35.861 --> 01:32:38.650
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>subsistence living shows like,</v>

2109
01:32:38.651 --> 01:32:39.484
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2110
01:32:39.530 --> 01:32:41.010
<v Speaker 1>those homesteading.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2111
01:32:41.020 --> 01:32:42.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's very,</v>

2112
01:32:42.640 --> 01:32:46.800
<v Speaker 1>it's a very attractive to people because</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a longing in our,</v>

2113
01:32:46.801 --> 01:32:51.430
<v Speaker 1>our DNA eve and where it just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a pole.</v>

2114
01:32:51.820 --> 01:32:54.670
<v Speaker 1>There's a pull to that man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would love to just grow Kale and raise</v>

2115
01:32:54.671 --> 01:32:55.504
<v Speaker 1>chickens and live off the phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot of people that feel like </v>

2116
01:32:58.450 --> 01:32:59.283
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really attracted to that and I think </v>

2117
01:33:00.371 --> 01:33:01.204
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's something deep in our being that </v>

2118
01:33:03.041 --> 01:33:03.874
<v Speaker 1>we're longing for this connection to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>real world and we've done an amazing </v>

2119
01:33:07.661 --> 01:33:10.540
<v Speaker 1>thing creating cities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's dependence.</v>

2120
01:33:10.541 --> 01:33:11.374
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's almost beyond our comprehension </v>

2121
01:33:14.501 --> 01:33:15.820
<v Speaker 1>because we're a part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2122
01:33:15.821 --> 01:33:17.140
<v Speaker 1>we're a part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's normal.</v>

2123
01:33:17.141 --> 01:33:19.030
<v Speaker 1>You get on the subway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get your car,</v>

2124
01:33:19.031 --> 01:33:21.340
<v Speaker 1>you drive through the city.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems normal,</v>

2125
01:33:21.730 --> 01:33:26.730
<v Speaker 1>but it's so far removed from every </v>
<v Speaker 1>single aspect of our history.</v>

2126
01:33:27.460 --> 01:33:28.810
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is so new.</v>

2127
01:33:28.811 --> 01:33:29.644
<v Speaker 1>It's so recent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think these people are just more in </v>

2128
01:33:34.211 --> 01:33:35.044
<v Speaker 1>tune.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2129
01:33:35.060 --> 01:33:38.050
<v Speaker 1>it's horrible that they have to deal </v>
<v Speaker 1>with these situations,</v>

2130
01:33:38.051 --> 01:33:43.051
<v Speaker 1>like the lack of water and toilets and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the diseases and all the other struggle.</v>

2131
01:33:44.410 --> 01:33:46.600
<v Speaker 1>But man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a part of what they're doing and</v>

2132
01:33:46.601 --> 01:33:47.434
<v Speaker 1>the way they're living that just seems </v>
<v Speaker 1>like they're more in tune in a natural </v>

2133
01:33:51.311 --> 01:33:52.150
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2134
01:33:52.151 --> 01:33:56.410
<v Speaker 1>You would think that they would be more </v>
<v Speaker 1>depressed and uh,</v>

2135
01:33:57.220 --> 01:33:58.600
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like you heard,</v>

2136
01:33:58.630 --> 01:33:59.463
<v Speaker 1>you heard Leo may's laughing that when </v>
<v Speaker 1>they asked him about the bananas and he </v>

2137
01:34:01.941 --> 01:34:02.830
<v Speaker 1>just got tickled,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2138
01:34:02.831 --> 01:34:04.780
<v Speaker 1>he couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't hold himself from just laughing</v>

2139
01:34:04.781 --> 01:34:06.160
<v Speaker 1>and saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't count that much.</v>

2140
01:34:06.360 --> 01:34:08.560
<v Speaker 1>Test someone from Beverly Hills and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

2141
01:34:08.561 --> 01:34:11.020
<v Speaker 1>this is what we got for a cause.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can grow bananas now.</v>

2142
01:34:11.040 --> 01:34:11.980
<v Speaker 1>They were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck you.</v>

2143
01:34:12.550 --> 01:34:14.830
<v Speaker 1>How do I get Outta here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Firstclass only you know,</v>

2144
01:34:15.550 --> 01:34:17.380
<v Speaker 1>where's my iphone?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2145
01:34:17.860 --> 01:34:20.440
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's weird band because essentially this</v>

2146
01:34:20.441 --> 01:34:23.170
<v Speaker 1>life is temporary ride for all of us </v>
<v Speaker 1>involved.</v>

2147
01:34:23.560 --> 01:34:25.390
<v Speaker 1>No one has ever got out of this thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>alive.</v>

2148
01:34:25.420 --> 01:34:26.800
<v Speaker 1>No one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one will.</v>

2149
01:34:26.950 --> 01:34:27.760
<v Speaker 1>It's not going to be you.</v>

2150
01:34:27.760 --> 01:34:29.860
<v Speaker 1>It's not going to be me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not gonna make it.</v>

2151
01:34:29.890 --> 01:34:31.690
<v Speaker 1>No one makes it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one's ever made it before.</v>

2152
01:34:31.720 --> 01:34:33.670
<v Speaker 1>No one's ever going to make it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's essentially like,</v>

2153
01:34:33.970 --> 01:34:36.680
<v Speaker 1>what is the quality of your experience </v>
<v Speaker 1>while you're here and how much people,</v>

2154
01:34:36.730 --> 01:34:39.700
<v Speaker 1>how many people are you touching?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And by that life,</v>

2155
01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:40.833
<v Speaker 1>by that definition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've lived one of the richest lives </v>

2156
01:34:43.030 --> 01:34:45.550
<v Speaker 1>that a person could ever live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

2157
01:34:45.850 --> 01:34:49.900
<v Speaker 1>Do you realize that every time brown yet</v>
<v Speaker 1>feel like a piece of shit?</v>

2158
01:34:49.930 --> 01:34:50.763
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want anyone to feel that way at </v>

2159
01:34:52.031 --> 01:34:52.950
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>

2160
01:34:53.090 --> 01:34:53.923
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then the way you're so selfless in </v>

2161
01:34:56.531 --> 01:34:57.440
<v Speaker 1>that regard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2162
01:34:57.441 --> 01:34:58.280
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

2163
01:34:59.300 --> 01:35:01.730
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I just connect it back to that.</v>

2164
01:35:01.760 --> 01:35:04.430
<v Speaker 2>I remember little gimpy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he got about 10,</v>

<v Speaker 2>maximum,</v>

2170
01:35:18.080 --> 01:35:21.470
<v Speaker 2>probably 14 or 15 peanuts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He worked all day long.</v>

2171
01:35:21.620 --> 01:35:25.790
<v Speaker 2>He's a five or six year old child that </v>
<v Speaker 2>worked from sunup to sundown.</v>

2172
01:35:25.940 --> 01:35:29.420
<v Speaker 2>And that's what he got paid was five or </v>
<v Speaker 2>up to 15,</v>

<v Speaker 2>peanuts.</v>

2174

<v Speaker 2>hand.</v>

2175
01:35:33.920 --> 01:35:37.820
<v Speaker 2>And he came and he sat by me and I just </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of put my arm around him and said,</v>

<v Speaker 2>And he just instantly like put his hand </v>

2180
01:35:49.370 --> 01:35:51.200

<v Speaker 2>you just worked all day long for that,</v>

2181
01:35:51.680 --> 01:35:53.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like from sunup to sundown.</v>

2182
01:35:53.331 --> 01:35:56.290
<v Speaker 2>But they're just so incredibly generous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2183
01:35:56.300 --> 01:35:58.370
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's mine is yours and what's yours?</v>

2184
01:35:58.460 --> 01:35:59.293
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2185
01:35:59.400 --> 01:36:03.380
<v Speaker 2>it's fun to kind of sit around the fire </v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes and eat because,</v>

2186
01:36:03.381 --> 01:36:04.670
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>

2187
01:36:04.671 --> 01:36:06.650
<v Speaker 2>it's rude and our culture and everything</v>
<v Speaker 2>else,</v>

2188
01:36:06.651 --> 01:36:07.484
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2189
01:36:07.580 --> 01:36:08.413
<v Speaker 2>but I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just enjoyed it whenever people would </v>

2190
01:36:09.861 --> 01:36:13.180
<v Speaker 2>start eating off my plate and how to eat</v>
<v Speaker 2>off of their plate and it just kind of,</v>

2191
01:36:13.181 --> 01:36:14.530
<v Speaker 2>because it's part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2192
01:36:14.920 --> 01:36:15.753
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or there's just a kind of a pile in the </v>

2193
01:36:17.511 --> 01:36:19.130
<v Speaker 2>middle or big plate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>big thing.</v>

2194
01:36:19.131 --> 01:36:19.964
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

2195
01:36:20.030 --> 01:36:21.640
<v Speaker 2>this is what we have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's,</v>

2196
01:36:21.641 --> 01:36:22.474
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's share.</v>

2197
01:36:22.490 --> 01:36:23.210
<v Speaker 2>Let's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2198
01:36:23.210 --> 01:36:24.800
<v Speaker 2>let's make sure we share everything </v>
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>

2199
01:36:25.160 --> 01:36:26.660
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some eight B,</v>

2200
01:36:27.020 --> 01:36:27.853
<v Speaker 2>sorry to interrupt you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But besides the farming and besides the </v>

2201
01:36:30.171 --> 01:36:31.400
<v Speaker 2>clean water,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what other,</v>

2202
01:36:31.430 --> 01:36:34.100
<v Speaker 2>what other changes have you witnessed?</v>

2203
01:36:34.130 --> 01:36:35.900
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so [inaudible] um,</v>

2204
01:36:36.260 --> 01:36:38.600
<v Speaker 2>which is so cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like my little buddy yet getting to</v>

2205
01:36:38.601 --> 01:36:40.520
<v Speaker 2>watch him grow up and he's going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>chief one day.</v>

2206
01:36:40.790 --> 01:36:44.630
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we just got determined that like that</v>

2207
01:36:44.631 --> 01:36:45.464
<v Speaker 2>young yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was his father had passed away and he </v>

2208
01:36:46.671 --> 01:36:48.310
<v Speaker 2>would have become the chief.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

2209
01:36:48.710 --> 01:36:50.450
<v Speaker 2>she signed under the chief and who's </v>
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>

2210
01:36:50.480 --> 01:36:51.950
<v Speaker 2>it's not an election process or </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>

2211
01:36:53.060 --> 01:36:56.300
<v Speaker 2>Basically there is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just among the village,</v>

2212
01:36:56.450 --> 01:36:57.283
<v Speaker 2>whenever I think I forget,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need to ask chief Alondo how he got </v>

2213
01:37:00.561 --> 01:37:01.394
<v Speaker 2>kind of voted in or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he was just the one that showed the </v>

2214
01:37:03.291 --> 01:37:05.720
<v Speaker 2>leadership qualities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the one that everyone followed.</v>

2215
01:37:06.030 --> 01:37:07.850
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the one that was most respected,</v>

2216
01:37:07.851 --> 01:37:10.820
<v Speaker 2>the one that was kind of the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>knowledgeable or caring.</v>

2217
01:37:10.821 --> 01:37:11.654
<v Speaker 2>That's a huge thing for them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who's going to think about our interest </v>

2218
01:37:13.910 --> 01:37:14.743
<v Speaker 2>the most and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then be strong enough to like be </v>

2219
01:37:17.931 --> 01:37:19.250
<v Speaker 2>tough whenever it needs to be tough.</v>

2220
01:37:19.760 --> 01:37:22.580
<v Speaker 2>And so chief Solano,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got incredible leadership skills.</v>

2221
01:37:22.700 --> 01:37:24.770
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like just a great guy.</v>

2222
01:37:24.771 --> 01:37:25.604
<v Speaker 2>He was one of the first ones that bought</v>
<v Speaker 2>into the vision for us to come in with </v>

2223
01:37:28.201 --> 01:37:29.210
<v Speaker 2>the land,</v>
<v Speaker 2>water and food.</v>

2224
01:37:29.540 --> 01:37:31.160
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people didn't trust us </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking,</v>

2225
01:37:31.161 --> 01:37:32.090
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're saying this.</v>

2226
01:37:32.450 --> 01:37:34.820
<v Speaker 2>And they have those tools that look like</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to drill wells,</v>

2227
01:37:34.821 --> 01:37:39.080
<v Speaker 2>but really they might be serving for </v>
<v Speaker 2>gold or diamonds or Colton who knows,</v>

2228
01:37:39.081 --> 01:37:39.914
<v Speaker 2>there just maybe using this as a cover.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he was one that stood up in the </v>

2229
01:37:42.591 --> 01:37:43.730
<v Speaker 2>community and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2230
01:37:44.120 --> 01:37:46.190
<v Speaker 2>we believe them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to work with them.</v>

2231
01:37:46.550 --> 01:37:47.383
<v Speaker 2>And so from that he's been able to go </v>
<v Speaker 2>out and tell other communities what's </v>

2232
01:37:51.231 --> 01:37:52.064
<v Speaker 2>happened in their village.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so one of the things that he's able </v>

2233
01:37:53.991 --> 01:37:56.280
<v Speaker 2>to go do is say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how has changed everything to where they</v>

2234
01:37:56.550 --> 01:37:59.670
<v Speaker 2>were able to get land to secure that so </v>
<v Speaker 2>we could come in and drill the wells for</v>

2235
01:37:59.671 --> 01:38:00.060
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

2236
01:38:00.060 --> 01:38:00.893
<v Speaker 2>Then after that they're able to start </v>
<v Speaker 2>farming and then you saw them going and </v>

2237
01:38:02.731 --> 01:38:05.670
<v Speaker 2>selling it at the markets to where they </v>
<v Speaker 2>can buy clothes for their kids.</v>

2238
01:38:06.090 --> 01:38:07.320
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not just about clothes.</v>

2239
01:38:07.410 --> 01:38:08.243
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>little gimpy last time I was there </v>

2240
01:38:09.990 --> 01:38:11.650
<v Speaker 2>getting ready to leave,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2241
01:38:11.670 --> 01:38:12.503
<v Speaker 2>he's always around and I had just been </v>
<v Speaker 2>able to get for the weekend and I was </v>

2242
01:38:15.811 --> 01:38:17.370
<v Speaker 2>only being able to stay there for three </v>
<v Speaker 2>days,</v>

2243
01:38:17.380 --> 01:38:20.100
<v Speaker 2>this trip in that village,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause we're going to some other places,</v>

2244
01:38:20.580 --> 01:38:21.413
<v Speaker 2>but I always stop and see him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so we're leaving and I don't get to </v>

2245
01:38:24.091 --> 01:38:26.420
<v Speaker 2>see kind of like my little buddy and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2246
01:38:26.421 --> 01:38:27.450
<v Speaker 2>where's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where's gyp yet?</v>

2247
01:38:27.770 --> 01:38:28.141
<v Speaker 2>And like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2248
01:38:28.141 --> 01:38:28.974
<v Speaker 2>you'll see them as you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so we got in the truck and we start </v>

2249
01:38:31.021 --> 01:38:31.854
<v Speaker 2>driving out and all of a sudden little </v>
<v Speaker 2>gimpy comes out of the schoolhouse and </v>

2250
01:38:34.651 --> 01:38:38.100
<v Speaker 2>he's running to us and I got to get out </v>
<v Speaker 2>and give them a hug,</v>

2251
01:38:38.101 --> 01:38:38.934
<v Speaker 2>tell him bye.</v>

2252
01:38:39.120 --> 01:38:39.953
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what's so huge is he was the first </v>

2253
01:38:42.300 --> 01:38:45.210
<v Speaker 2>my booty pygmy ever in school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in that region,</v>

2254
01:38:45.240 --> 01:38:50.240
<v Speaker 2>that area that they know of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so from kind of getting a little bit</v>

2255
01:38:50.761 --> 01:38:51.594
<v Speaker 2>more equal rights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then also being able to pay for </v>

2256
01:38:53.161 --> 01:38:54.950
<v Speaker 2>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2257
01:38:55.260 --> 01:38:56.093
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're supposed to be a government </v>

2258
01:38:56.641 --> 01:39:00.090
<v Speaker 2>program where the pygmies can go to </v>
<v Speaker 2>school and go for free,</v>

2259
01:39:00.270 --> 01:39:01.103
<v Speaker 2>but they're like the only ones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're kind of like the native </v>

2260
01:39:02.281 --> 01:39:03.360
<v Speaker 2>Americans of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

2261
01:39:03.470 --> 01:39:04.790
<v Speaker 2>of Congo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2262
01:39:04.810 --> 01:39:05.643
<v Speaker 2>they have basically zero rights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's one that the government has </v>

2263
01:39:07.141 --> 01:39:09.150
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but normally it's not honored.</v>

2264
01:39:09.240 --> 01:39:10.960
<v Speaker 2>And secondly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2265
01:39:11.340 --> 01:39:15.540
<v Speaker 2>they don't go to school if they need to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be spending time hunting or gathering.</v>

2266
01:39:15.630 --> 01:39:16.463
<v Speaker 2>Cause you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kids going to sit in school while he's </v>

2267
01:39:17.611 --> 01:39:19.110
<v Speaker 2>hungry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's not to be able to focus.</v>

2268
01:39:19.190 --> 01:39:20.023
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for him to be able to have food to </v>

2269
01:39:21.511 --> 01:39:22.344
<v Speaker 2>take to school is a huge thing so that </v>
<v Speaker 2>he can sit there for them to be able to </v>

2270
01:39:25.021 --> 01:39:26.280
<v Speaker 2>pay the school fees on their own.</v>

2271
01:39:26.310 --> 01:39:28.050
<v Speaker 2>They didn't take that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They said,</v>

2272
01:39:28.051 --> 01:39:28.884
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't want the government program </v>

2273
01:39:29.651 --> 01:39:32.430
<v Speaker 2>saying we can come to school for free.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to pay his school fees.</v>

2274
01:39:32.760 --> 01:39:34.950
<v Speaker 2>He's going to be chief one day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're investing into him.</v>

2275
01:39:35.490 --> 01:39:38.130
<v Speaker 2>And so to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to know that once,</v>

2276
01:39:38.131 --> 01:39:38.964
<v Speaker 2>once there's some educated my booty </v>
<v Speaker 2>pygmies that takes away the last excuse </v>

2277
01:39:42.361 --> 01:39:43.194
<v Speaker 2>that I see for the government to not </v>
<v Speaker 2>honor them as true citizens of the </v>

2278
01:39:46.501 --> 01:39:48.120
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2279
01:39:48.240 --> 01:39:50.760
<v Speaker 2>they have no representation on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>government level.</v>

2280
01:39:50.820 --> 01:39:53.430
<v Speaker 2>Zero,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's over 200 tribes there.</v>

2281
01:39:53.460 --> 01:39:55.620
<v Speaker 2>All of them have representation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

2282
01:39:55.700 --> 01:39:57.420
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for years it was because,</v>

2283
01:39:57.630 --> 01:39:59.550
<v Speaker 2>or for always it was because they </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought they were half man,</v>

2284
01:39:59.551 --> 01:40:00.690
<v Speaker 2>half animal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2285
01:40:00.691 --> 01:40:02.160
<v Speaker 2>now it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2286
01:40:02.280 --> 01:40:03.113
<v Speaker 2>it's because they say no one's educated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one's ever graduated from primary </v>

2287
01:40:06.211 --> 01:40:07.044
<v Speaker 2>school or secondary school and no one's </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever graduated with a high school </v>

2288
01:40:09.601 --> 01:40:11.790
<v Speaker 2>degree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so until that happens,</v>

2289
01:40:12.150 --> 01:40:14.940
<v Speaker 2>no booty pygmy me or they don't have </v>
<v Speaker 2>representation.</v>

2290
01:40:15.270 --> 01:40:17.190
<v Speaker 2>So we're hoping that as they get </v>
<v Speaker 2>schooling,</v>

2291
01:40:17.250 --> 01:40:18.083
<v Speaker 2>there'll be able to go to the courts and</v>
<v Speaker 2>represent themselves and have more </v>

2292
01:40:19.891 --> 01:40:23.310
<v Speaker 2>rights in their community and culture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if I've ever told you that,</v>

2293
01:40:23.311 --> 01:40:28.311
<v Speaker 2>but I'm a real dark part of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the pygmy history,</v>

2294
01:40:28.471 --> 01:40:31.050
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or Congolese history and what we,</v>

2295
01:40:31.110 --> 01:40:31.943
<v Speaker 2>what people have done to them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what we have done to them at 1902 to </v>

2296
01:40:34.681 --> 01:40:36.110
<v Speaker 2>1906,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2297
01:40:36.240 --> 01:40:36.561
<v Speaker 2>we had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2298
01:40:36.561 --> 01:40:38.580
<v Speaker 2>a booty pygmy from night taree rain </v>
<v Speaker 2>forest,</v>

2299
01:40:38.581 --> 01:40:41.130
<v Speaker 2>right where I've lived in state and we </v>
<v Speaker 2>put them in the zoo.</v>

2300
01:40:41.640 --> 01:40:44.970
<v Speaker 2>Did I say that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe we didn't talk it was talked about</v>

2301
01:40:44.971 --> 01:40:46.080
<v Speaker 2>it on the podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

2302
01:40:46.081 --> 01:40:47.470
<v Speaker 2>it's horrific.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2303
01:40:47.520 --> 01:40:48.353
<v Speaker 2>It seems Ota Benga and we literally fed </v>
<v Speaker 2>them bananas in the Monkey House at the </v>

2304
01:40:52.771 --> 01:40:55.390
<v Speaker 2>Bronx in New York.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we threw him bananas,</v>

2305
01:40:55.391 --> 01:40:59.830
<v Speaker 2>why he lived there with the monkeys and </v>
<v Speaker 2>a Christ in a human being like that.</v>

2306
01:40:59.830 --> 01:41:00.940
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2307
01:41:01.150 --> 01:41:02.800
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was a over a hundred years ago,</v>

2308
01:41:02.801 --> 01:41:03.634
<v Speaker 2>but it's almost like in those regions </v>
<v Speaker 2>where they don't have land or wa are </v>

2309
01:41:06.581 --> 01:41:07.414
<v Speaker 2>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't have running water and </v>

2310
01:41:07.771 --> 01:41:10.690
<v Speaker 2>electricity and a lot of education that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we do here,</v>

2311
01:41:10.691 --> 01:41:11.524
<v Speaker 2>some places are kind of stuck in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>pocket that's kind of about a hundred </v>

2312
01:41:14.560 --> 01:41:15.970
<v Speaker 2>years back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2313
01:41:16.030 --> 01:41:18.130
<v Speaker 2>and so some of that mentality still </v>
<v Speaker 2>exist.</v>

2314
01:41:18.460 --> 01:41:22.990
<v Speaker 2>So this could be the beginning steps and</v>
<v Speaker 2>just completely changing their culture,</v>

2315
01:41:24.040 --> 01:41:25.540
<v Speaker 2>educating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what we were seeing,</v>

2316
01:41:25.720 --> 01:41:27.910
<v Speaker 2>having,</v>
<v Speaker 2>having the chief come out and say,</v>

2317
01:41:27.970 --> 01:41:28.803
<v Speaker 2>this is the first official ever land in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the booty pygmies own and our </v>

2318
01:41:32.321 --> 01:41:34.180
<v Speaker 2>government's history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the first water,</v>

2319
01:41:34.181 --> 01:41:35.014
<v Speaker 2>well clean water source ever among them </v>
<v Speaker 2>a booty pygmies that they've ever owned </v>

2320
01:41:38.590 --> 01:41:39.423
<v Speaker 2>first time they're ever farming for </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves and going to the market and </v>

2321
01:41:41.411 --> 01:41:44.800
<v Speaker 2>selling it that had local radio station.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2322
01:41:44.830 --> 01:41:48.190
<v Speaker 2>there's only like one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's the reinforce a few hours away,</v>

2323
01:41:48.400 --> 01:41:50.500
<v Speaker 2>but they came out to the market to do a </v>
<v Speaker 2>story,</v>

2324
01:41:50.910 --> 01:41:51.743
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with chiefly among them because they </v>

2325
01:41:53.081 --> 01:41:55.240
<v Speaker 2>were actually selling their produce and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>

2326
01:41:55.241 --> 01:41:55.550
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

2327
01:41:55.550 --> 01:41:57.670
<v Speaker 2>The pygmies have always been hunter </v>
<v Speaker 2>gatherers.</v>

2328
01:41:57.700 --> 01:41:58.533
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the deforestation has made it basically </v>

2329
01:41:59.351 --> 01:42:00.184
<v Speaker 2>impossible for them to completely </v>
<v Speaker 2>sustain themselves off hunting and </v>

2330
01:42:02.681 --> 01:42:04.960
<v Speaker 2>gathering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Animals are scared and skittish and they</v>

2331
01:42:04.961 --> 01:42:05.794
<v Speaker 2>run away from the trees that when they </v>
<v Speaker 2>fall sound like thunder going through </v>

2332
01:42:08.591 --> 01:42:10.760
<v Speaker 2>the forest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it makes it really hard to,</v>

2333
01:42:10.830 --> 01:42:12.940
<v Speaker 2>to go hunt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2334
01:42:13.480 --> 01:42:15.760
<v Speaker 2>and be able to feed a whole tribe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a whole village.</v>

2335
01:42:16.570 --> 01:42:17.403
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2336
01:42:17.440 --> 01:42:18.400
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be able to say,</v>

2337
01:42:18.401 --> 01:42:19.234
<v Speaker 2>these are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the first time they're farming </v>

2338
01:42:20.321 --> 01:42:21.460
<v Speaker 2>and selling this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2339
01:42:21.461 --> 01:42:24.250
<v Speaker 2>it just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're getting more and more,</v>

2340
01:42:24.520 --> 01:42:25.251
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like they're,</v>

2341
01:42:25.251 --> 01:42:29.130
<v Speaker 2>they're catching up with the people </v>
<v Speaker 2>around them and we want them to do it as</v>

2342
01:42:29.131 --> 01:42:29.964
<v Speaker 2>slow pace that they want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So keep everything culturally sound for </v>

2343
01:42:33.011 --> 01:42:33.844
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what they do want to bring into </v>

2344
01:42:35.051 --> 01:42:37.150
<v Speaker 2>their culture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we want to rally behind that.</v>

2345
01:42:37.510 --> 01:42:40.240
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's powerful dude.</v>

2346
01:42:40.241 --> 01:42:42.470
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're there at the,</v>

2347
01:42:42.471 --> 01:42:45.460
<v Speaker 2>the steps of their culture changing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2348
01:42:45.461 --> 01:42:46.630
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're right there.</v>

2349
01:42:47.260 --> 01:42:47.860
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's been,</v>

2350
01:42:47.860 --> 01:42:48.693
<v Speaker 2>it's been changing or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or it's been corrupted so much because </v>

2351
01:42:52.301 --> 01:42:53.134
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because of outside influences coming in </v>

2352
01:42:55.001 --> 01:42:56.470
<v Speaker 2>with the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the chain saws,</v>

2353
01:42:56.471 --> 01:42:57.304
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are mechanized ones where they can </v>

2354
01:42:59.141 --> 01:43:02.980
<v Speaker 2>just start cutting the trees down at </v>
<v Speaker 2>such a crazy rate.</v>

2355
01:43:03.140 --> 01:43:03.973
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen those monster machines a </v>

2356
01:43:04.811 --> 01:43:06.190
<v Speaker 2>terrifying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

2357
01:43:06.250 --> 01:43:09.190
<v Speaker 2>Stripped the bark off of it all in one </v>
<v Speaker 2>movement and cut it down.</v>

2358
01:43:09.640 --> 01:43:10.780
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that nuts?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of those.</v>

2359
01:43:10.840 --> 01:43:12.130
<v Speaker 2>It's scary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2360
01:43:12.240 --> 01:43:14.320
<v Speaker 2>I can get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like science fiction movie stuff.</v>

2361
01:43:15.420 --> 01:43:16.253
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they have that because there's a lot </v>

2362
01:43:18.251 --> 01:43:19.840
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not as advanced as that,</v>

2363
01:43:19.841 --> 01:43:20.674
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have guys just constantly day in </v>

2364
01:43:24.281 --> 01:43:26.320
<v Speaker 2>and day out that it's almost like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2365
01:43:26.380 --> 01:43:28.030
<v Speaker 2>aunts following each other through the </v>
<v Speaker 2>forest,</v>

2366
01:43:28.031 --> 01:43:31.180
<v Speaker 2>but they have bicycles and they throw </v>
<v Speaker 2>these long,</v>

2367
01:43:31.330 --> 01:43:35.050
<v Speaker 2>20 foot planks of a Mahogany or I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

2368
01:43:35.051 --> 01:43:37.390
<v Speaker 2>isn't it ebony that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that other really heavy,</v>

2369
01:43:37.600 --> 01:43:38.433
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hardwood and they're just taking those </v>

2370
01:43:40.301 --> 01:43:41.830
<v Speaker 2>out of the forest all day long.</v>

2371
01:43:41.920 --> 01:43:43.350
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just in lines,</v>

2372
01:43:43.360 --> 01:43:46.750
<v Speaker 2>there's a line of people going with </v>
<v Speaker 2>empty bicycles and there's a line coming</v>

2373
01:43:46.751 --> 01:43:47.584
<v Speaker 2>back out with it full of wood and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>just start legally deforesting putting </v>

2374
01:43:50.681 --> 01:43:51.514
<v Speaker 2>it in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of these 18 wheelers that normally have </v>

2375
01:43:53.661 --> 01:43:54.494
<v Speaker 2>two trailers on the back of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or two containers on the back and they </v>

2376
01:43:58.131 --> 01:43:58.964
<v Speaker 2>fill them to the top.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's where a lot of the bridges </v>

2377
01:44:01.461 --> 01:44:03.710
<v Speaker 2>collapse because they're going over,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're overloaded.</v>

2378
01:44:04.040 --> 01:44:06.050
<v Speaker 2>I have a picture of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was a wild,</v>

2379
01:44:06.770 --> 01:44:09.830
<v Speaker 2>wild time where we got behind this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2380
01:44:09.950 --> 01:44:10.783
<v Speaker 2>this Lori that was ahead of us and we </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't see it collapse or anything like </v>

2381
01:44:13.071 --> 01:44:13.491
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

2382
01:44:13.491 --> 01:44:14.324
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we knew that they were carrying way </v>

2383
01:44:16.131 --> 01:44:18.980
<v Speaker 2>too much weight to cross the bridges </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we had crossed earlier.</v>

2384
01:44:19.010 --> 01:44:20.120
<v Speaker 2>And so we knew,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh man,</v>

2385
01:44:20.150 --> 01:44:24.140
<v Speaker 2>I hope that bridge is still is still up </v>
<v Speaker 2>and running by the time we get back.</v>

2386
01:44:24.670 --> 01:44:27.860
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then it just completely caved in and</v>

2387
01:44:27.861 --> 01:44:28.850
<v Speaker 2>crashed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

2388
01:44:28.950 --> 01:44:31.310
<v Speaker 2>That bridge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that bridge is ridiculous.</v>

2389
01:44:31.370 --> 01:44:32.203
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that was built and how do they </v>

2390
01:44:33.231 --> 01:44:34.064
<v Speaker 2>get across that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They drove across that they were </v>

2391
01:44:36.381 --> 01:44:37.380
<v Speaker 2>driving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was,</v>

2392
01:44:37.540 --> 01:44:39.290
<v Speaker 2>that was the bridge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2393
01:44:39.291 --> 01:44:40.124
<v Speaker 2>Wooden planks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what we would drive across </v>

2394
01:44:41.541 --> 01:44:43.970
<v Speaker 2>all the time to go out and drill our </v>
<v Speaker 2>wells and stuff.</v>

2395
01:44:44.570 --> 01:44:45.403
<v Speaker 2>But the guys legally logging and </v>
<v Speaker 2>carrying way too much weight legally </v>

2396
01:44:50.610 --> 01:44:51.890
<v Speaker 2>illegally locked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2397
01:44:52.160 --> 01:44:53.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought you were saying legally,</v>

2398
01:44:53.420 --> 01:44:54.040
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sorry.</v>

2399
01:44:54.040 --> 01:44:55.090
<v Speaker 2>Illegally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2400
01:44:55.440 --> 01:44:58.550
<v Speaker 2>and so what kind of reinforcement that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they have in their laws,</v>

2401
01:44:58.551 --> 01:45:00.490
<v Speaker 2>like the deforestation laws,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2402
01:45:00.530 --> 01:45:02.450
<v Speaker 2>basically nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2403
01:45:02.451 --> 01:45:03.650
<v Speaker 2>they say it's illegal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

2404
01:45:03.770 --> 01:45:04.603
<v Speaker 2>but everybody does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It turns a blind eye because they're </v>

2405
01:45:06.051 --> 01:45:06.884
<v Speaker 2>getting paid asset bribes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's a lot of money involved in </v>

2406
01:45:09.621 --> 01:45:10.820
<v Speaker 2>hardwood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

2407
01:45:11.120 --> 01:45:11.953
<v Speaker 2>Especially those rare African hardwoods.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's where the rubber boom </v>

2408
01:45:15.650 --> 01:45:19.010
<v Speaker 2>basically started was Congo by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Belgiums King Leopold.</v>

2409
01:45:19.010 --> 01:45:19.843
<v Speaker 2>The second he wrote a crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or there's a crazy book written about </v>

2410
01:45:22.071 --> 01:45:22.904
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>King Leopold's ghost talks about how </v>

2411
01:45:24.411 --> 01:45:25.244
<v Speaker 2>that was the African Holocaust and </v>
<v Speaker 2>basically that Congo had 20 million in </v>

2412
01:45:28.581 --> 01:45:29.414
<v Speaker 2>population,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but eight to 10 million people were </v>

2413
01:45:31.701 --> 01:45:35.450
<v Speaker 2>killed throughout the Belgians coming </v>
<v Speaker 2>and colonizing the Congo.</v>

2414
01:45:35.970 --> 01:45:36.651
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he,</v>

2415
01:45:36.651 --> 01:45:37.484
<v Speaker 2>he paraded around like he was the hero </v>
<v Speaker 2>of Congo and we're bringing </v>

2416
01:45:41.180 --> 01:45:42.013
<v Speaker 2>infrastructure and business and they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting rich and they're growing and </v>

2417
01:45:45.021 --> 01:45:48.440
<v Speaker 2>they're getting water and buildings and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're advancing so much.</v>

2418
01:45:48.950 --> 01:45:49.783
<v Speaker 2>And he would go on these public </v>
<v Speaker 2>campaigns basically talking about all </v>

2419
01:45:52.281 --> 01:45:55.000
<v Speaker 2>the good they're doing in the Congo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but basically a,</v>

2420
01:45:55.010 --> 01:45:58.550
<v Speaker 2>you can see these terrible brutal </v>
<v Speaker 2>pictures of basically a father,</v>

2421
01:45:58.551 --> 01:46:03.551
<v Speaker 2>I think reaching out to his child's hand</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's on the ground because they took a</v>

2422
01:46:04.101 --> 01:46:04.934
<v Speaker 2>machete and cut his kid's hand off and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's reaching out to grab it and he </v>

2423
01:46:07.911 --> 01:46:10.850
<v Speaker 2>doesn't have hands because they had </v>
<v Speaker 2>already cut his hands off too.</v>

2424
01:46:11.750 --> 01:46:13.430
<v Speaker 2>And so it's just been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>since,</v>

2425
01:46:14.720 --> 01:46:16.790
<v Speaker 2>it's just been brutal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're always,</v>

2426
01:46:16.791 --> 01:46:19.280
<v Speaker 2>because they had the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was the rubber and ivory boom,</v>

2427
01:46:19.460 --> 01:46:22.430
<v Speaker 2>and then after that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now it's the rare hardwoods,</v>

2428
01:46:22.431 --> 01:46:24.200
<v Speaker 2>the gold,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the coal tan,</v>

2429
01:46:24.260 --> 01:46:25.093
<v Speaker 2>the uranium,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which they used to make cell phones </v>

2430
01:46:26.691 --> 01:46:27.410
<v Speaker 2>with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

2431
01:46:27.410 --> 01:46:29.510
<v Speaker 2>It conducts electricity that really high</v>
<v Speaker 2>rate,</v>

2432
01:46:29.511 --> 01:46:32.180
<v Speaker 2>but it stays cool so it doesn't overheat</v>
<v Speaker 2>her blow up on you.</v>

2433
01:46:33.020 --> 01:46:33.853
<v Speaker 2>And I think 80% of the world's Coltan </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it comes from the Congo and </v>

2434
01:46:36.231 --> 01:46:40.700
<v Speaker 2>basically all of its illegal mining by </v>
<v Speaker 2>rebels and everything else.</v>

2435
01:46:40.790 --> 01:46:41.623
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the dirty secret about people's </v>

2436
01:46:43.011 --> 01:46:45.200
<v Speaker 2>phones and a lot of the electronics that</v>
<v Speaker 2>we use.</v>

2437
01:46:45.260 --> 01:46:48.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah man.</v>

2438
01:46:48.651 --> 01:46:50.130
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's been,</v>

2439
01:46:50.160 --> 01:46:54.410
<v Speaker 1>it's been an incredible journey to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>part of tis.</v>

2440
01:46:54.420 --> 01:46:56.280
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't have dreamed this like </v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't have,</v>

2441
01:46:56.970 --> 01:47:00.660
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't have thought it up or it </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't have it on my goals list,</v>

2442
01:47:00.720 --> 01:47:03.450
<v Speaker 1>didn't have it on my radar as a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're so perfect for it.</v>

2443
01:47:03.451 --> 01:47:04.284
<v Speaker 1>That's what's so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems like it's kind of changed you </v>

2444
01:47:05.851 --> 01:47:08.250
<v Speaker 1>as a human being without and solidified </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

2445
01:47:08.330 --> 01:47:09.163
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of ways I think conviction </v>

2446
01:47:10.921 --> 01:47:13.380
<v Speaker 1>that you fight with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not just that of a competitor.</v>

2447
01:47:13.381 --> 01:47:18.300
<v Speaker 1>It's like a man with a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not even just a goal,</v>

2448
01:47:18.301 --> 01:47:20.640
<v Speaker 1>like a destiny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very strange,</v>

2449
01:47:21.210 --> 01:47:21.901
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

2450
01:47:21.901 --> 01:47:26.430
<v Speaker 1>you're doing something that's bigger </v>
<v Speaker 1>than most people can even comprehend.</v>

2451
01:47:26.431 --> 01:47:29.730
<v Speaker 1>And I feel like the weight of that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>pushing you forward.</v>

2452
01:47:30.300 --> 01:47:31.021
<v Speaker 1>And this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2453
01:47:31.021 --> 01:47:34.960
<v Speaker 1>this really incredible way to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know anybody like human,</v>

2454
01:47:35.690 --> 01:47:37.820
<v Speaker 1>the only guy I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you,</v>

2455
01:47:38.390 --> 01:47:39.120
<v Speaker 1>you're the only guy I know.</v>

<v Speaker 1>into your life and you pour into theirs.</v>

2459
01:47:49.261 --> 01:47:50.094
<v Speaker 1>And because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's so many cool things that are </v>

2460
01:47:53.041 --> 01:47:54.270
<v Speaker 1>happening in man.</v>

<v Speaker 1>fuck it up.</v>

01:48:18.720 --> 01:48:21.090
<v Speaker 1>That's what I tried to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I try to show up and not fuck it up.</v>

2473
01:48:21.390 --> 01:48:22.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's so nice.</v>

2474
01:48:22.700 --> 01:48:23.250
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

2475
01:48:23.250 --> 01:48:26.220
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the float tank center that I go to in,</v>

2476
01:48:26.221 --> 01:48:27.030
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oklahoma,</v>

2477
01:48:27.030 --> 01:48:30.720
<v Speaker 1>it's called Fluid Casey on w my first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no second time in there.</v>

2478
01:48:30.760 --> 01:48:31.230
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were like,</v>

2479
01:48:31.230 --> 01:48:34.350
<v Speaker 1>oh he didn't check the box of how you </v>
<v Speaker 1>heard of this and a,</v>

2480
01:48:34.351 --> 01:48:36.390
<v Speaker 1>it was like friend family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this or that.</v>

2481
01:48:36.391 --> 01:48:37.224
<v Speaker 1>And then Joe Rogan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they started up because of you </v>

2482
01:48:39.901 --> 01:48:41.190
<v Speaker 1>and like they're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

2483
01:48:41.430 --> 01:48:43.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's probably 20 or 30 in the country</v>

2484
01:48:43.801 --> 01:48:47.580
<v Speaker 1>before joe started talking about it on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the podcast and now it's just grown.</v>

2485
01:48:47.581 --> 01:48:49.140
<v Speaker 1>So it's hundreds of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

2486
01:48:49.141 --> 01:48:51.660
<v Speaker 1>I think there's over 300 people said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you have a piece of those?</v>

2487
01:48:51.661 --> 01:48:52.560
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nope.</v>

2488
01:48:52.600 --> 01:48:53.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no good,</v>

2489
01:48:53.551 --> 01:48:54.720
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Keep going.</v>

2490
01:48:54.750 --> 01:48:56.350
<v Speaker 1>I don't want any money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2491
01:48:56.351 --> 01:48:57.184
<v Speaker 1>More power to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's an amazing way to change </v>

2492
01:48:59.161 --> 01:48:59.994
<v Speaker 1>the way you look at the world and see </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself and be alone with your </v>

2493
01:49:02.491 --> 01:49:03.060
<v Speaker 1>thoughts.</v>

2494
01:49:03.060 --> 01:49:03.893
<v Speaker 1>And I just think it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the best tools for human </v>

2495
01:49:06.241 --> 01:49:07.370
<v Speaker 1>development.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2496
01:49:07.380 --> 01:49:09.300
<v Speaker 1>that's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just think it's incredible.</v>

2497
01:49:09.360 --> 01:49:10.193
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was shocked when more people didn't </v>

2498
01:49:11.791 --> 01:49:12.650
<v Speaker 1>know about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2499
01:49:12.710 --> 01:49:17.460
<v Speaker 1>I had one in my house in 2002 wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somewhere around there.</v>

2500
01:49:17.470 --> 01:49:18.211
<v Speaker 1>We'll do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2501
01:49:18.211 --> 01:49:20.000
<v Speaker 1>2003 it's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

2502
01:49:20.010 --> 01:49:20.843
<v Speaker 1>one of the reasons why I got this house </v>
<v Speaker 1>was because it had a basement and I'm </v>

2503
01:49:24.541 --> 01:49:24.990
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

2504
01:49:24.990 --> 01:49:26.730
<v Speaker 1>perfect place for a tank.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

2505
01:49:26.731 --> 01:49:27.061
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2506
01:49:27.061 --> 01:49:27.591
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

2507
01:49:27.591 --> 01:49:29.730
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking at houses all fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might,</v>

2508
01:49:29.731 --> 01:49:30.564
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have enough room in the backyard to </v>

2509
01:49:30.980 --> 01:49:32.500
<v Speaker 1>shoot my bow yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To.</v>

2510
01:49:32.540 --> 01:49:33.900
<v Speaker 1>Is there a tank room?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

2511
01:49:33.901 --> 01:49:36.270
<v Speaker 1>That's how I look at houses now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's cool.</v>

2512
01:49:36.271 --> 01:49:37.530
<v Speaker 1>So how do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's okay,</v>

2513
01:49:37.531 --> 01:49:41.550
<v Speaker 1>how do you use,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I floated eight times now and the,</v>

2514
01:49:41.940 --> 01:49:46.590
<v Speaker 1>I'd finally done a two hour float,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was I think a lot more beneficial.</v>

2515
01:49:46.591 --> 01:49:48.400
<v Speaker 1>Doing it bit lost the game changer.</v>

2516
01:49:48.460 --> 01:49:49.660
<v Speaker 2>Oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was awesome.</v>

2517
01:49:49.720 --> 01:49:52.720
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but Wednesday before my fight on Friday,</v>

2518
01:49:53.440 --> 01:49:57.220
<v Speaker 2>March 3rd,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went in and I had this intention where</v>

2519
01:49:57.221 --> 01:49:59.020
<v Speaker 2>Neil from photo casey was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

2520
01:49:59.470 --> 01:50:00.303
<v Speaker 2>why don't you instead of just rushing in</v>
<v Speaker 2>here from training or rushing in here </v>

2521
01:50:02.590 --> 01:50:03.423
<v Speaker 2>from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2522
01:50:03.760 --> 01:50:07.090
<v Speaker 2>from the office at water for like come </v>
<v Speaker 2>in 30 minutes early,</v>

2523
01:50:07.091 --> 01:50:09.490
<v Speaker 2>kind of sit down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>chill,</v>

2524
01:50:09.580 --> 01:50:11.050
<v Speaker 2>close your eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2525
01:50:11.080 --> 01:50:12.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>set an intention.</v>

2526
01:50:12.780 --> 01:50:13.870
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then do it.</v>

2527
01:50:13.871 --> 01:50:16.750
<v Speaker 2>And I came in and I had watched a </v>
<v Speaker 2>documentary called the flute nation.</v>

2528
01:50:16.960 --> 01:50:18.370
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

2529
01:50:18.820 --> 01:50:20.770
<v Speaker 2>it was cool cause it's like an hour,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hour and a half.</v>

2530
01:50:20.800 --> 01:50:21.633
<v Speaker 2>And it showed a lot of different things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it showed some scientific stuff of </v>

2531
01:50:24.221 --> 01:50:25.054
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of sports psychologist and basically </v>

2532
01:50:27.101 --> 01:50:27.934
<v Speaker 2>visualization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I've done some more research </v>

2533
01:50:29.981 --> 01:50:33.110
<v Speaker 2>and there's this like place in Tulsa </v>
<v Speaker 2>that has some brain doctors,</v>

2534
01:50:33.320 --> 01:50:36.190
<v Speaker 2>I mean doctors that are research and </v>
<v Speaker 2>neuroscience and for stuff,</v>

2535
01:50:36.191 --> 01:50:37.024
<v Speaker 2>but they're finally doing a clinical </v>
<v Speaker 2>study with people with anxiety and </v>

2536
01:50:40.081 --> 01:50:40.510
<v Speaker 2>depression.</v>

2537
01:50:40.510 --> 01:50:42.470
<v Speaker 2>It's finally fully funded.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2538
01:50:43.120 --> 01:50:43.953
<v Speaker 2>and the guy was talking about it and was</v>
<v Speaker 2>saying that basically the same exact </v>

2539
01:50:48.550 --> 01:50:49.383
<v Speaker 2>results that antianxiety medicine has.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The float tank can do a hundred percent </v>

2540
01:50:54.281 --> 01:50:57.490
<v Speaker 2>naturally and that the studies are </v>
<v Speaker 2>coming out to back it up.</v>

2541
01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:00.400
<v Speaker 2>And so it's just really cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the tank Wednesday,</v>

2542
01:51:00.430 --> 01:51:03.730
<v Speaker 2>I basically visualize the fight exactly </v>
<v Speaker 2>the way it went down on Friday.</v>

2543
01:51:04.060 --> 01:51:06.550
<v Speaker 2>I just had this intense tie that was the</v>
<v Speaker 2>best float I've,</v>

2544
01:51:06.610 --> 01:51:08.920
<v Speaker 2>I've had were just sitting there </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking about the fight,</v>

2545
01:51:08.921 --> 01:51:09.754
<v Speaker 2>thinking about the fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking about the fight and saying </v>

2546
01:51:11.321 --> 01:51:12.154
<v Speaker 2>everything that I wanted to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like I went to training </v>

2547
01:51:14.171 --> 01:51:18.310
<v Speaker 2>before then I got and I was drilling the</v>
<v Speaker 2>moves I wanted to do on the flight.</v>

2548
01:51:18.820 --> 01:51:23.820
<v Speaker 2>Then I went into the tank and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I had right before that.</v>

2549
01:51:23.831 --> 01:51:26.090
<v Speaker 2>So I was drilling early that morning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2550
01:51:26.170 --> 01:51:29.050
<v Speaker 2>everything that I wanted to do on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>flight kind of visualizing before I went</v>

2551
01:51:29.051 --> 01:51:29.884
<v Speaker 2>into the tank.</v>

2552
01:51:30.190 --> 01:51:32.680
<v Speaker 2>Then when I came out I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or before I got in the tank,</v>

2553
01:51:32.681 --> 01:51:36.010
<v Speaker 2>after training,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started to watch fight film on him,</v>

2554
01:51:36.011 --> 01:51:36.844
<v Speaker 2>see how he's moving and then I went into</v>
<v Speaker 2>the tank and I was able to just think </v>

2555
01:51:39.971 --> 01:51:42.580
<v Speaker 2>about what he's going to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>think about what I'm going to do,</v>

2556
01:51:42.760 --> 01:51:44.830
<v Speaker 2>how I'm going to implement it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then it's not,</v>

2557
01:51:44.831 --> 01:51:45.664
<v Speaker 2>it's like the only thing only difference</v>
<v Speaker 2>was is I got two big throws instead of </v>

2558
01:51:48.371 --> 01:51:49.680
<v Speaker 2>one big thorough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2559
01:51:49.780 --> 01:51:50.613
<v Speaker 2>in the vision had one throw and then in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the fight had two big throws but the </v>

2560
01:51:53.141 --> 01:51:54.820
<v Speaker 2>ground and pound straight into the arm </v>
<v Speaker 2>triangle.</v>

2561
01:51:54.880 --> 01:51:58.210
<v Speaker 2>Exactly what I've been envisioning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you say personal development,</v>

2562
01:51:58.211 --> 01:51:58.721
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

2563
01:51:58.721 --> 01:51:59.920
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2564
01:51:59.921 --> 01:52:01.300
<v Speaker 2>so how do you do it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you,</v>

2565
01:52:02.230 --> 01:52:04.510
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if that makes sense.</v>

2566
01:52:04.511 --> 01:52:06.880
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm wanting to learn how to go deep</v>
<v Speaker 2>with it.</v>

2567
01:52:07.140 --> 01:52:09.550
<v Speaker 2>Just let go and use it as a tool of </v>
<v Speaker 2>personal development.</v>

2568
01:52:09.580 --> 01:52:11.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The more often you can get into it,</v>

2569
01:52:11.291 --> 01:52:12.124
<v Speaker 2>the more you get relaxed and the more </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can sort of slip into that </v>

2570
01:52:15.760 --> 01:52:16.593
<v Speaker 2>comfortable state of not feeling the </v>
<v Speaker 2>water or feeling the air and just being </v>

2571
01:52:20.861 --> 01:52:22.720
<v Speaker 2>in your mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>see nothing,</v>

2572
01:52:22.721 --> 01:52:23.554
<v Speaker 2>feel nothing released from your body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I'll either go in there with </v>

2573
01:52:27.521 --> 01:52:29.840
<v Speaker 2>ideas like maybe I'll go in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

2574
01:52:29.920 --> 01:52:30.753
<v Speaker 2>I've gone over Jujitsu in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've gone over different martial arts </v>

2575
01:52:33.881 --> 01:52:36.370
<v Speaker 2>techniques in there where you sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>visualize movement.</v>

2576
01:52:36.760 --> 01:52:38.350
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of that I use,</v>

2577
01:52:38.351 --> 01:52:39.880
<v Speaker 2>I do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll go over material.</v>

2578
01:52:39.881 --> 01:52:41.170
<v Speaker 2>Like I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll have ideas.</v>

2579
01:52:41.380 --> 01:52:44.920
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes it fucks up my float where I </v>
<v Speaker 2>have an idea that I can't let,</v>

2580
01:52:45.360 --> 01:52:46.040
<v Speaker 2>like I have</v>

2581
01:52:46.040 --> 01:52:51.040
<v Speaker 1>to set something up where I have a voice</v>
<v Speaker 1>activated recorder inside the float tank</v>

2582
01:52:51.531 --> 01:52:52.364
<v Speaker 1>where I can talk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but part of me doesn't want to talk </v>

2583
01:52:54.321 --> 01:52:56.540
<v Speaker 1>while I'm in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just want to be alone with my thoughts</v>

2584
01:52:56.541 --> 01:52:58.970
<v Speaker 1>because I think when you talk it'll take</v>
<v Speaker 1>you out of it.</v>

2585
01:52:59.270 --> 01:53:00.103
<v Speaker 1>But there's some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some ideas that I don't want to escape </v>

2586
01:53:01.821 --> 01:53:04.460
<v Speaker 1>me because ideals are slippery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2587
01:53:04.480 --> 01:53:05.180
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

2588
01:53:05.180 --> 01:53:06.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a great idea.</v>

2589
01:53:06.590 --> 01:53:09.380
<v Speaker 1>Like sometimes I'll have a great idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>when I'm in bed and I'm like,</v>

2590
01:53:09.440 --> 01:53:10.310
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll remember that.</v>

2591
01:53:10.460 --> 01:53:13.130
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember it ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you fucking ever,</v>

2592
01:53:13.400 --> 01:53:16.070
<v Speaker 1>I might remember one at a 10 that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think I'm going to remember.</v>

2593
01:53:16.460 --> 01:53:17.293
<v Speaker 1>So I'm probably going to have to figure </v>
<v Speaker 1>out some way to record things while I'm </v>

2594
01:53:20.181 --> 01:53:22.370
<v Speaker 1>in the tank.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But for me,</v>

2595
01:53:22.371 --> 01:53:23.151
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2596
01:53:23.151 --> 01:53:24.290
<v Speaker 1>it depends on what I'm trying to do.</v>

2597
01:53:24.680 --> 01:53:27.440
<v Speaker 1>Trying to be balanced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think about life,</v>

2598
01:53:27.441 --> 01:53:29.350
<v Speaker 1>think about my behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think about my,</v>

2599
01:53:29.370 --> 01:53:31.490
<v Speaker 1>my interaction with people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2600
01:53:31.491 --> 01:53:36.491
<v Speaker 1>my is to have as much energy and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and an appreciation as I should do.</v>

2601
01:53:37.041 --> 01:53:39.260
<v Speaker 1>I have as much gratitude as I should.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2602
01:53:39.261 --> 01:53:40.094
<v Speaker 1>I want to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just want to optimize my thought </v>

2603
01:53:42.261 --> 01:53:43.280
<v Speaker 1>process,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

2604
01:53:43.370 --> 01:53:48.370
<v Speaker 1>And then definitely not claiming that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>do or that I always have it right.</v>

2605
01:53:48.441 --> 01:53:49.274
<v Speaker 1>I definitely don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an ongoing process and that's one </v>

2606
01:53:51.381 --> 01:53:54.590
<v Speaker 1>of the realities of being a person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea of the perfect person.</v>

2607
01:53:54.591 --> 01:53:57.710
<v Speaker 1>It just doesn't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's a bad,</v>

2608
01:53:58.100 --> 01:53:58.933
<v Speaker 1>it's a bad model to strive for and </v>
<v Speaker 1>instead he should strive for doing your </v>

2609
01:54:02.271 --> 01:54:04.430
<v Speaker 1>best whenever you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as much as you can.</v>

2610
01:54:04.760 --> 01:54:08.390
<v Speaker 1>And I think that reviewing your thoughts</v>
<v Speaker 1>and reviewing,</v>

2611
01:54:08.420 --> 01:54:09.141
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

2612
01:54:09.141 --> 01:54:09.974
<v Speaker 1>your whole mental process is a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>important part of optimization about </v>

2613
01:54:14.271 --> 01:54:18.230
<v Speaker 1>being your best and just taking account </v>
<v Speaker 1>and looking at it from,</v>

2614
01:54:18.500 --> 01:54:19.333
<v Speaker 1>I think it's one of the rare moments </v>
<v Speaker 1>where you're actually alone with your </v>

2615
01:54:22.191 --> 01:54:23.450
<v Speaker 1>thoughts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2616
01:54:23.451 --> 01:54:27.740
<v Speaker 1>where there's no influence of the body </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the distractions of the body,</v>

2617
01:54:27.741 --> 01:54:32.360
<v Speaker 1>of just even the weight of sitting down </v>
<v Speaker 1>and feeling your butt on the chair,</v>

2618
01:54:32.570 --> 01:54:34.280
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your elbows on his desk,</v>

2619
01:54:34.281 --> 01:54:38.000
<v Speaker 1>all those things are factors and there </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're being calculated by your mind.</v>

2620
01:54:38.600 --> 01:54:39.433
<v Speaker 1>And the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the analogy that I always use is if you </v>

2621
01:54:41.031 --> 01:54:43.640
<v Speaker 1>and I were having this conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but right next to us as a Jackhammer,</v>

2622
01:54:43.810 --> 01:54:47.510
<v Speaker 1>it would be super distracting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's just input that Jackhammer is</v>

2623
01:54:47.511 --> 01:54:49.610
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just profound input.</v>

2624
01:54:49.970 --> 01:54:53.060
<v Speaker 1>And I think that everything is input.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Social Cues,</v>

2625
01:54:53.061 --> 01:54:54.980
<v Speaker 1>looking at people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sounds,</v>

2626
01:54:55.250 --> 01:54:57.050
<v Speaker 1>feeling touch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gravity,</v>

2627
01:54:57.350 --> 01:54:58.183
<v Speaker 1>all those things or input that is going </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the mind that your mind has to </v>

2628
01:55:01.671 --> 01:55:05.510
<v Speaker 1>calculate in the absence of any input,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's physical touch,</v>

2629
01:55:05.511 --> 01:55:07.190
<v Speaker 1>you feel like you're flying through </v>
<v Speaker 1>space,</v>

2630
01:55:07.191 --> 01:55:08.024
<v Speaker 1>you feel it in zero gravity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't feel the water cause it's the </v>

2631
01:55:09.921 --> 01:55:12.140
<v Speaker 1>same temperatures or scan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're floating in it.</v>

2632
01:55:12.141 --> 01:55:12.974
<v Speaker 1>It's total silence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>total darkness and the absence of that </v>

2633
01:55:15.800 --> 01:55:16.633
<v Speaker 1>input.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think your brain becomes super </v>

2634
01:55:17.781 --> 01:55:18.614
<v Speaker 1>powered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it becomes supercharged and I </v>

2635
01:55:20.151 --> 01:55:22.250
<v Speaker 1>think you get to see things in a much </v>
<v Speaker 1>clearer way.</v>

2636
01:55:22.520 --> 01:55:23.160
<v Speaker 1>And I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

2637
01:55:23.160 --> 01:55:26.570
<v Speaker 1>I've seen myself at fault when I thought</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was innocent.</v>

2638
01:55:26.810 --> 01:55:31.810
<v Speaker 1>I've seen myself a happy and fulfilled </v>
<v Speaker 1>when I thought it was longing.</v>

2639
01:55:32.580 --> 01:55:33.413
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's given me a much more balanced </v>

2640
01:55:34.641 --> 01:55:35.474
<v Speaker 1>perspective and a better way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>addressing the realities of the </v>

2641
01:55:39.591 --> 01:55:41.080
<v Speaker 1>complexities of life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

2642
01:55:41.950 --> 01:55:42.783
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's great.</v>

2643
01:55:43.470 --> 01:55:44.850
<v Speaker 1>That's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Powerful tool,</v>

2644
01:55:44.851 --> 01:55:48.360
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was weird to me that around 2002 when</v>

2645
01:55:48.361 --> 01:55:51.570
<v Speaker 1>I really started talking about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that nobody knew what the fuck it was.</v>

2646
01:55:51.960 --> 01:55:53.130
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how is this a weird,</v>

2647
01:55:53.200 --> 01:55:55.380
<v Speaker 1>how am I the guy who's talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

2648
01:55:55.620 --> 01:56:00.080
<v Speaker 1>how's the UFC commentator,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy who's talking about floating and</v>

2649
01:56:00.081 --> 01:56:01.740
<v Speaker 1>we just didn't make any sense to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2650
01:56:01.800 --> 01:56:02.430
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2651
01:56:02.430 --> 01:56:03.263
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you had talked about it and I </v>

2652
01:56:06.781 --> 01:56:07.614
<v Speaker 1>knew about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't until I got in the tank </v>

2653
01:56:10.801 --> 01:56:14.550
<v Speaker 1>and came out of the tank for the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>time that then I got it.</v>

2654
01:56:14.800 --> 01:56:15.633
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

2655
01:56:15.660 --> 01:56:17.430
<v Speaker 1>Oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like this is awesome.</v>

2656
01:56:17.550 --> 01:56:21.650
<v Speaker 1>And the physical aspects of the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the magnesium in your body feel and the,</v>

2657
01:56:21.840 --> 01:56:25.500
<v Speaker 1>the looseness of the being in zero </v>
<v Speaker 1>gravity environment,</v>

2658
01:56:25.501 --> 01:56:28.260
<v Speaker 1>what feels like zero gravity?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything gets loose.</v>

2659
01:56:28.261 --> 01:56:31.740
<v Speaker 1>It just relaxes the back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>relaxes the arms and knees,</v>

2660
01:56:31.741 --> 01:56:32.850
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the neck.</v>

2661
01:56:32.880 --> 01:56:35.720
<v Speaker 1>Everything just gets loose in there and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you come out just feeling good.</v>

2662
01:56:35.740 --> 01:56:37.050
<v Speaker 1>You want to hug people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

2663
01:56:37.051 --> 01:56:39.390
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly how I came out.</v>

2664
01:56:39.780 --> 01:56:43.350
<v Speaker 1>I came out and had a smile from ear to </v>
<v Speaker 1>ear and when I came out of it,</v>

2665
01:56:43.351 --> 01:56:43.711
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2666
01:56:43.711 --> 01:56:44.544
<v Speaker 1>you have the post float glow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I actually gave the guy a hug if I </v>

2667
01:56:46.950 --> 01:56:47.783
<v Speaker 1>didn't even know his name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but gave him a big hug and it was so </v>

2668
01:56:50.221 --> 01:56:50.790
<v Speaker 1>cool,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2669
01:56:50.790 --> 01:56:51.640
<v Speaker 1>And it's neat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2670
01:56:51.720 --> 01:56:55.890
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the float community seems like a like,</v>

2671
01:56:55.920 --> 01:56:57.300
<v Speaker 1>like everyone just chill.</v>

2672
01:56:57.330 --> 01:57:02.220
<v Speaker 1>Everyone that has a deeper appreciation </v>
<v Speaker 1>for that might be too much,</v>

2673
01:57:02.221 --> 01:57:03.054
<v Speaker 1>but it seems like everyone's got a </v>
<v Speaker 1>deeper appreciation for life where they </v>

2674
01:57:05.160 --> 01:57:05.993
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2675
01:57:06.600 --> 01:57:08.400
<v Speaker 1>I dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's something to what you're</v>

2676
01:57:08.401 --> 01:57:10.320
<v Speaker 1>saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sounds pretentious,</v>

2677
01:57:10.830 --> 01:57:13.080
<v Speaker 1>but you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is something there.</v>

2678
01:57:13.110 --> 01:57:14.880
<v Speaker 1>I know what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like saying that,</v>

2679
01:57:15.480 --> 01:57:16.313
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2680
01:57:16.350 --> 01:57:17.970
<v Speaker 1>there's something special about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

2681
01:57:18.090 --> 01:57:20.430
<v Speaker 1>I think a big part of what that </v>
<v Speaker 1>something special is,</v>

2682
01:57:20.431 --> 01:57:23.280
<v Speaker 1>is the alleviation of tension.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think tension,</v>

2683
01:57:23.281 --> 01:57:24.114
<v Speaker 1>you're much like inflammation causes a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of diseases and a lot of disorders </v>

2684
01:57:27.271 --> 01:57:31.230
<v Speaker 1>that people have pertaining to dye it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that inflammation causes,</v>

2685
01:57:31.231 --> 01:57:33.240
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you were talking about with a,</v>

2686
01:57:33.241 --> 01:57:35.220
<v Speaker 1>you're a CELIAC.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

2687
01:57:35.221 --> 01:57:36.870
<v Speaker 1>That is a lot of it is based on </v>
<v Speaker 1>inflammation,</v>

2688
01:57:36.871 --> 01:57:37.590
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2689
01:57:37.590 --> 01:57:39.950
<v Speaker 1>I think tension is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2690
01:57:39.990 --> 01:57:40.823
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in many ways the physical tension is </v>

2691
01:57:43.411 --> 01:57:44.790
<v Speaker 1>also a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another,</v>

2692
01:57:44.850 --> 01:57:47.190
<v Speaker 1>a real boundary to comfort.</v>

2693
01:57:47.400 --> 01:57:51.240
<v Speaker 1>And that physical tension is alleviated </v>
<v Speaker 1>greatly when you're in that tank.</v>

2694
01:57:51.480 --> 01:57:53.220
<v Speaker 1>And I think when you're more </v>
<v Speaker 1>comfortable,</v>

2695
01:57:53.221 --> 01:57:54.990
<v Speaker 1>you're more relaxed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you're more relaxed,</v>

2696
01:57:54.991 --> 01:57:56.370
<v Speaker 1>you're more open.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you're more open,</v>

2697
01:57:56.371 --> 01:57:57.204
<v Speaker 1>you're more loving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think all those things sort of </v>

2698
01:57:58.531 --> 01:57:59.970
<v Speaker 1>cascade,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2699
01:57:59.971 --> 01:58:00.401
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

2700
01:58:00.401 --> 01:58:01.234
<v Speaker 1>they feed on each other and they help.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when a tense person that's like </v>

2701
01:58:03.721 --> 01:58:05.580
<v Speaker 1>stressful like fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

2702
01:58:05.581 --> 01:58:06.061
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2703
01:58:06.061 --> 01:58:07.200
<v Speaker 1>you got Janet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2704
01:58:07.201 --> 01:58:10.260
<v Speaker 1>it's really hard to like be calm and </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind,</v>

2705
01:58:10.620 --> 01:58:12.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like you're so wound up.</v>

2706
01:58:12.870 --> 01:58:17.070
<v Speaker 1>I think that thing removes a lot of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>physical aspects of being wound up.</v>

2707
01:58:17.071 --> 01:58:17.904
<v Speaker 1>And then on top of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the deep meditative effects of being in </v>

2708
01:58:21.481 --> 01:58:22.314
<v Speaker 1>that tank,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if you go into it like you </v>

2709
01:58:23.581 --> 01:58:28.581
<v Speaker 1>did with like a vision or a direction </v>
<v Speaker 1>and a thought to work on.</v>

2710
01:58:30.150 --> 01:58:33.330
<v Speaker 1>I think it does wonders for free of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought process.</v>

2711
01:58:33.660 --> 01:58:34.493
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm still learning about it </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the first couple times I was </v>

2712
01:58:37.651 --> 01:58:42.280
<v Speaker 1>just trying to just wipe my mind clean </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it coming this stress</v>

2713
01:58:42.310 --> 01:58:43.143
<v Speaker 2>completely stress free,</v>
<v Speaker 2>feeling completely stress free at least </v>

2714
01:58:45.940 --> 01:58:46.773
<v Speaker 2>was awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then going in there with an </v>

2715
01:58:48.371 --> 01:58:51.940
<v Speaker 2>intention and with a goal with a fight </v>
<v Speaker 2>just a couple of days away.</v>

2716
01:58:52.210 --> 01:58:53.890
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know that this is what happened,</v>

2717
01:58:53.891 --> 01:58:54.724
<v Speaker 2>but in training I had been feeling great</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then it felt like something just </v>

2718
01:58:58.631 --> 01:59:00.970
<v Speaker 2>turned on or sort of firing where it </v>
<v Speaker 2>connected.</v>

2719
01:59:00.971 --> 01:59:01.804
<v Speaker 2>Like the mental visualization to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>physical of actually going in there and </v>

2720
01:59:04.661 --> 01:59:08.800
<v Speaker 2>doing it the exact way that I saw it was</v>
<v Speaker 2>something that just,</v>

2721
01:59:08.980 --> 01:59:10.330
<v Speaker 2>I kind of blew my mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

2722
01:59:10.750 --> 01:59:12.160
<v Speaker 2>it was cool to see that happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2723
01:59:12.340 --> 01:59:13.173
<v Speaker 2>because you'd want to see the match or </v>
<v Speaker 2>the fight a hundred times in your head </v>

2724
01:59:15.911 --> 01:59:17.760
<v Speaker 2>before we ever go out there and do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2725
01:59:17.800 --> 01:59:19.480
<v Speaker 2>I mean not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not put things in,</v>

2726
01:59:19.481 --> 01:59:20.314
<v Speaker 2>it's where if it goes bad or if it </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't go exactly the way in the fight </v>

2727
01:59:22.301 --> 01:59:23.740
<v Speaker 2>that then you freak out during the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight.</v>

2728
01:59:24.190 --> 01:59:25.023
<v Speaker 2>But you want to have a goal and an </v>
<v Speaker 2>intention and know what you're going to </v>

2729
01:59:26.801 --> 01:59:27.634
<v Speaker 2>do in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's probably what connor </v>

2730
01:59:28.541 --> 01:59:29.374
<v Speaker 2>did when he was fighting Aldo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He knew he was going to go in there and </v>

2731
01:59:32.540 --> 01:59:33.373
<v Speaker 2>indeed quick and he saw that happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I'm not saying I don't want put </v>

2732
01:59:37.271 --> 01:59:38.104
<v Speaker 2>words in this top.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When he talked about it after the Eddie </v>

2733
01:59:39.760 --> 01:59:40.301
<v Speaker 2>Alvarez fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>

2734
01:59:40.301 --> 01:59:41.134
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a vision of me standing here with </v>

2735
01:59:42.591 --> 01:59:45.080
<v Speaker 2>the second belt and acquitted the focus </v>
<v Speaker 2>me other their belt.</v>

2736
01:59:45.420 --> 01:59:47.550
<v Speaker 2>He was like really upset,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2737
01:59:47.620 --> 01:59:49.390
<v Speaker 2>I visualize this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted,</v>

2738
01:59:49.750 --> 01:59:52.750
<v Speaker 2>and then tyron woodley of all people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had to give his belt.</v>

2739
01:59:52.751 --> 01:59:54.120
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was really cool that they did that,</v>

2740
01:59:54.150 --> 01:59:56.500
<v Speaker 2>that the tire and allowed that to </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>

2741
01:59:56.680 --> 01:59:58.200
<v Speaker 2>Kudos to him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then that,</v>

2742
01:59:58.500 --> 02:00:00.190
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2743
02:00:00.191 --> 02:00:01.024
<v Speaker 2>the visualization of a goal is very </v>
<v Speaker 2>important to like solidifying this idea </v>

2744
02:00:06.521 --> 02:00:08.200
<v Speaker 2>of what that goal is in your mind.</v>

2745
02:00:08.410 --> 02:00:10.480
<v Speaker 2>Visualization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's been,</v>

2746
02:00:10.540 --> 02:00:11.373
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's been studies done on </v>

2747
02:00:12.401 --> 02:00:15.520
<v Speaker 2>visualization and as far as athletics </v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2748
02:00:15.540 --> 02:00:16.373
<v Speaker 2>and skill learning and some people </v>
<v Speaker 2>believe it is as important as physical </v>

2749
02:00:19.931 --> 02:00:22.360
<v Speaker 2>practice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is kind of crazy,</v>

2750
02:00:22.390 --> 02:00:23.410
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2751
02:00:23.411 --> 02:00:24.460
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can see that.</v>

2752
02:00:24.490 --> 02:00:25.323
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean Kenny Monday who's been involved </v>

2753
02:00:27.191 --> 02:00:30.400
<v Speaker 2>in them and make community quite a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was my high school wrestling coach.</v>

2754
02:00:30.850 --> 02:00:31.400
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2755
02:00:31.400 --> 02:00:32.470
<v Speaker 2>he told me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go home,</v>

2756
02:00:32.560 --> 02:00:34.170
<v Speaker 2>write a goal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put it with somewhere,</v>

2757
02:00:34.180 --> 02:00:35.860
<v Speaker 2>you can see it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I wrote down,</v>

2758
02:00:35.861 --> 02:00:37.570
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he told me to write down state champ,</v>

2759
02:00:37.571 --> 02:00:40.150
<v Speaker 2>but I wrote down national champ and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>put it above my bed.</v>

2760
02:00:40.540 --> 02:00:42.210
<v Speaker 2>And then over here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2761
02:00:42.220 --> 02:00:43.690
<v Speaker 2>working with him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>training,</v>

2762
02:00:44.080 --> 02:00:45.340
<v Speaker 2>getting some wrestling moves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I put,</v>

2763
02:00:45.341 --> 02:00:46.174
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a step around body lock on the left and </v>

2764
02:00:49.121 --> 02:00:52.060
<v Speaker 2>I played a lateral drop on the right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so my,</v>

2765
02:00:52.450 --> 02:00:55.360
<v Speaker 2>my favorite rest and move on the left </v>
<v Speaker 2>and my second favorite wrestling move on</v>

2766
02:00:55.361 --> 02:00:56.110
<v Speaker 2>the right.</v>

2767
02:00:56.110 --> 02:00:58.390
<v Speaker 2>And when I won my first national </v>
<v Speaker 2>championship,</v>

2768
02:00:58.391 --> 02:01:00.730
<v Speaker 2>it was what the move on the left and one</v>
<v Speaker 2>on one my second,</v>

2769
02:01:00.731 --> 02:01:02.770
<v Speaker 2>it was with the move on the right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it was,</v>

2770
02:01:02.771 --> 02:01:05.770
<v Speaker 2>I was going to bed thinking about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dreaming about it,</v>

2771
02:01:05.771 --> 02:01:07.210
<v Speaker 2>Waking Up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>starting my day,</v>

2772
02:01:07.240 --> 02:01:09.040
<v Speaker 2>thinking about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

2773
02:01:09.100 --> 02:01:12.660
<v Speaker 2>in wanting to really put that in action.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I,</v>

2774
02:01:12.720 --> 02:01:13.553
<v Speaker 2>I totally get it and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need to be more conscious of it and </v>

2775
02:01:16.421 --> 02:01:19.540
<v Speaker 2>dive even deeper into it because I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>like you,</v>

2776
02:01:19.541 --> 02:01:21.040
<v Speaker 2>I agree that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2777
02:01:21.130 --> 02:01:21.963
<v Speaker 2>or at least I can see the point and how </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's valid that the mental focus and </v>

2778
02:01:25.331 --> 02:01:28.720
<v Speaker 2>energy and visualizing is pretty much </v>
<v Speaker 2>just as important as actually physically</v>

2779
02:01:28.721 --> 02:01:29.890
<v Speaker 2>doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's huge.</v>

2780
02:01:29.891 --> 02:01:32.500
<v Speaker 2>And all of them together are really what</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all about.</v>

2781
02:01:32.501 --> 02:01:33.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's none of that.</v>

2782
02:01:33.470 --> 02:01:34.131
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2783
02:01:34.131 --> 02:01:35.170
<v Speaker 2>no aspect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2784
02:01:35.171 --> 02:01:36.550
<v Speaker 2>no aspect can be ignored.</v>

2785
02:01:37.240 --> 02:01:39.040
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to get out of here soon.</v>

2786
02:01:39.080 --> 02:01:41.930
<v Speaker 2>Is there anything else you want to tell </v>
<v Speaker 2>people about or wrap this up?</v>

2787
02:01:42.110 --> 02:01:42.890
<v Speaker 2>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can,</v>

2788
02:01:42.890 --> 02:01:45.500
<v Speaker 2>we can get to wrapping it up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a real quick,</v>

2789
02:01:45.680 --> 02:01:50.600
<v Speaker 2>we have two goals going on right now </v>
<v Speaker 2>where I'm at water four.org.</v>

2790
02:01:50.601 --> 02:01:52.670
<v Speaker 2>We're doing a world water day campaign.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2791
02:01:52.910 --> 02:01:56.780

<v Speaker 2>audacious goal to do that water tank,</v>

2792

<v Speaker 2>it's going to serve 4,000 people and </v>

2794
02:02:01.011 --> 02:02:04.820
<v Speaker 2>then create more water wells.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a $50,000 goal,</v>

2795
02:02:05.030 --> 02:02:09.320
<v Speaker 2>but we've already raised 35.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone yesterday gave 25 grand to it.</v>

2796
02:02:09.640 --> 02:02:11.590
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so we're,</v>

2800
02:02:16.401 --> 02:02:17.234
<v Speaker 2>if that happens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're able to really make that </v>

<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2821
02:03:00.320 --> 02:03:03.260
<v Speaker 2>did $25 a month over the course of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>year,</v>

2822
02:03:03.261 --> 02:03:04.094
<v Speaker 2>your gift,</v>
<v Speaker 2>15 people clean water for the rest of </v>

02:03:05.691 --> 02:03:06.524
<v Speaker 2>their lives.</v>

2824
02:03:06.530 --> 02:03:07.363
<v Speaker 2>And the reason that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is because we train up the locals to go </v>

2825
02:03:08.661 --> 02:03:11.660
<v Speaker 2>out and be able to repair the wells and </v>
