<v Speaker 1>golf ball rolls around.</v>

20
00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:59.480
<v Speaker 1>They have one of those for archery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You actually use a regular compound bow</v>

21
00:00:59.481 --> 00:01:02.900
<v Speaker 1>and you shoot it at the screen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when the tips,</v>

22
00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.690
<v Speaker 1>instead of using a regular um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>arrow tip,</v>

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.660
<v Speaker 1>you use this flat tip.</v>

<v Speaker 1>you like these animals that you'd be</v>

27
00:01:18.861 --> 00:01:23.720
<v Speaker 1>hunting and you use an actual bow and</v>
<v Speaker 1>where it hits it shows you whether or</v>

28

139
00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:16.700
<v Speaker 2>who did this video?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

140
00:06:16.701 --> 00:06:20.270
<v Speaker 2>it was people who did my webpage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put the video together.</v>

141
00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:21.950
<v Speaker 2>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need to do something like this for</v>

142
00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:24.080
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So by the time it hit the stage,</v>

143
00:06:24.081 --> 00:06:25.400
<v Speaker 2>you can see it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was dark.</v>

144
00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:27.530
<v Speaker 2>Fuck man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is amazing.</v>

145
00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:30.780
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>

146
00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:34.040
<v Speaker 2>what does the sound like?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have it dark because there were only</v>

147
00:06:34.041 --> 00:06:37.640
<v Speaker 2>400 people in the entire venue here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at the size of that place.</v>

148
00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:42.110
<v Speaker 2>That's madness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's 9,000 people.</v>

149
00:06:42.111 --> 00:06:44.120
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so beautiful too,</v>

150
00:06:44.121 --> 00:06:45.380
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty cool.</v>

151
00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:48.020
<v Speaker 2>There's something about that place and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could run the stairs and get a</v>

152
00:06:48.021 --> 00:06:49.250
<v Speaker 2>workout before you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

153
00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:50.930
<v Speaker 2>before you actually perform.</v>

154
00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:54.200
<v Speaker 2>I have some friends who live in Colorado</v>
<v Speaker 2>who go to red rock just to run the</v>

155
00:06:54.201 --> 00:06:56.300
<v Speaker 2>stairs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

156
00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:58.280
<v Speaker 2>I walked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

157
00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:01.370
<v Speaker 2>we got there early in the day and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>walked like halfway up just to see what</v>

158
00:07:01.371 --> 00:07:03.590
<v Speaker 2>it was like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And plus it's a high altitude.</v>

159
00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:08.660
<v Speaker 2>I was like out of breath,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just walking up once halfway.</v>

160
00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:10.580
<v Speaker 2>So there's no way I'm running those</v>
<v Speaker 2>stairs.</v>

161
00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:13.400
<v Speaker 2>Did you ever do Aspen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>aspen comedy festival back when they had</v>

162
00:07:13.401 --> 00:07:13.700
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

163
00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:16.670
<v Speaker 2>years ago they used to give you oxygen</v>
<v Speaker 2>backstage.</v>

164
00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:17.691
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

165
00:07:17.691 --> 00:07:19.970
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've done shows at high altitude areas</v>

166
00:07:19.971 --> 00:07:24.020
<v Speaker 2>where they will point out where the</v>
<v Speaker 2>oxygen tanks are backstage and say,</v>

167
00:07:24.021 --> 00:07:25.730
<v Speaker 2>if you need it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're right.</v>

168
00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:28.040
<v Speaker 2>That's pretty disconcerting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Weird.</v>

169
00:07:28.041 --> 00:07:29.630
<v Speaker 2>You Go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why would I need that?</v>

170
00:07:29.631 --> 00:07:31.640
<v Speaker 2>And they go well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then they'll mention artists who</v>

171
00:07:31.641 --> 00:07:33.290
<v Speaker 2>needed it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you know who had to come off stage</v>

172
00:07:33.291 --> 00:07:35.390
<v Speaker 2>and take a hit off it or whatever?</v>

173
00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:36.830
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never had to do it,</v>

174
00:07:36.831 --> 00:07:38.990
<v Speaker 2>but I have gotten light headed like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

175
00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:41.270
<v Speaker 2>Breckenridge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I remember being light,</v>

176
00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:42.200
<v Speaker 2>light,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lightheaded on stall.</v>

177
00:07:42.201 --> 00:07:43.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's,</v>

178
00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:46.610
<v Speaker 2>I think Aspen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to say it's like a thousand feet</v>

179
00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:49.760
<v Speaker 2>above Denver.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think Aspen,</v>

180
00:07:49.761 --> 00:07:52.670
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty up there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is kind of a crazy place to do a</v>

181
00:07:52.671 --> 00:07:53.770
<v Speaker 2>comedy festival.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

182
00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:54.620
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

183
00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:58.520
<v Speaker 2>And also when I used to perform at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>comedy works in Denver,</v>

184
00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:03.770
<v Speaker 2>I didn't realize that alcohol would</v>
<v Speaker 2>affect you more intensely at a high</v>

185
00:08:03.771 --> 00:08:06.440
<v Speaker 2>altitude as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I used to drink a couple of beers</v>

186
00:08:06.441 --> 00:08:09.350
<v Speaker 2>before a show and on a three shows</v>
<v Speaker 2>Saturday night,</v>

187
00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:12.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that third show you might have four</v>

188
00:08:12.171 --> 00:08:14.540
<v Speaker 2>or five years in you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't do that anymore,</v>

189
00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:17.050
<v Speaker 2>but I'd be on stayed going lid.</v>

190
00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:23.360
<v Speaker 2>I slurred my punch lines and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

191
00:08:23.361 --> 00:08:24.194
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

192
00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:26.780
<v Speaker 2>I don't like to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to kind of be in control.</v>

193
00:08:26.781 --> 00:08:28.060
<v Speaker 2>It's not a good feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

194
00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:30.860
<v Speaker 2>You know what's nice though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right before you lose control,</v>

195
00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:35.030
<v Speaker 2>you got to get like right to the door.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got a right to the door is a fun</v>

196
00:08:35.031 --> 00:08:37.430
<v Speaker 2>place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And on the line right on the edge,</v>

197
00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:39.380
<v Speaker 2>it's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know we need like,</v>

198
00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:43.150
<v Speaker 2>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a strip that you could like a lick</v>

199
00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:46.130
<v Speaker 2>getting close here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

200
00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:48.710
<v Speaker 2>Well I know you like to shoot pool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We shot pool last time.</v>

201
00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:51.890
<v Speaker 2>It's similar to that when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a couple of beers,</v>

202
00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:55.070
<v Speaker 2>like for some people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think I'm one of these,</v>

203
00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:56.130
<v Speaker 2>if I'm completely</v>

204
00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:58.440
<v Speaker 1>sober,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not as good of a pool shooter</v>

205
00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:01.070
<v Speaker 1>because I'm too tense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

206
00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:04.920
<v Speaker 1>Where if you have a beer or two in you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you loosen up a little bit where you</v>

207
00:09:04.921 --> 00:09:08.280
<v Speaker 1>play better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then you cross the line and then</v>

208
00:09:08.281 --> 00:09:09.990
<v Speaker 1>you're gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yet where it's just,</v>

209
00:09:09.991 --> 00:09:12.900
<v Speaker 1>you're not good at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's that line you're talking about.</v>

210
00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:17.130
<v Speaker 1>I don't play good under alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I played good on marijuana,</v>

211
00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:20.010
<v Speaker 1>like marijuana and pool to me goes</v>
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>

212
00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:23.160
<v Speaker 1>But alcoholic just doesn't really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't really go that good.</v>

213
00:09:23.890 --> 00:09:27.630
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't even imagine shooting pool</v>

214
00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:28.980
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

215
00:09:28.981 --> 00:09:31.240
<v Speaker 1>the thing is about marijuana use.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You paranoid,</v>

216
00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:34.590
<v Speaker 1>you get definitely get paranoid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You gotta think about that for ball is</v>

217
00:09:34.591 --> 00:09:38.880
<v Speaker 1>saying something to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the deal with the why?</v>

218
00:09:38.881 --> 00:09:41.400
<v Speaker 1>Why are the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is the two and the seven together</v>

219
00:09:41.401 --> 00:09:43.360
<v Speaker 1>like that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would start thinking weird.</v>

220
00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:45.970
<v Speaker 1>There's a message,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a message in this table clearly.</v>

221
00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:46.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

222
00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:49.320
<v Speaker 1>there's absolute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I took a month off,</v>

223
00:09:49.321 --> 00:09:50.154
<v Speaker 1>we did this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

224
00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:53.760
<v Speaker 1>me and Ari Shaffir and Bert Kreischer</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Thompson Euro.</v>

225
00:09:53.761 --> 00:09:55.920
<v Speaker 1>We did this sober October thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

226
00:09:56.010 --> 00:10:00.690
<v Speaker 1>which I'm going to do every year and we</v>
<v Speaker 1>took a month off of everything except</v>

227
00:10:00.691 --> 00:10:05.400
<v Speaker 1>coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we also did 1590 minute beak from</v>

228
00:10:05.401 --> 00:10:08.250
<v Speaker 1>yoga classes for the month.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you owed 15.</v>

229
00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:11.250
<v Speaker 1>So it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was an interesting little exercise in</v>

230
00:10:11.251 --> 00:10:13.110
<v Speaker 1>discipline because he had to do the yoga</v>
<v Speaker 1>classes,</v>

231
00:10:13.111 --> 00:10:15.810
<v Speaker 1>you had to get a man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it was also interesting for a guy</v>

232
00:10:15.811 --> 00:10:20.811
<v Speaker 1>who's been smoking pot pretty regularly</v>
<v Speaker 1>for 2020 years around then for to go to</v>

233
00:10:22.471 --> 00:10:23.610
<v Speaker 1>nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>zero.</v>

234
00:10:23.970 --> 00:10:26.730
<v Speaker 1>It was very strange and very</v>
<v Speaker 1>educational.</v>

235
00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:28.630
<v Speaker 1>I think very valuable to kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gives.</v>

236
00:10:28.631 --> 00:10:30.960
<v Speaker 1>Give me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it gave me a real good perspective on</v>

237
00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:34.710
<v Speaker 1>the benefits of marijuana and maybe</v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps some of the cons too.</v>

238
00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:37.800
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this past October,</v>

239
00:10:37.801 --> 00:10:37.950
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

240
00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:39.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Completely sober.</v>

241
00:10:39.391 --> 00:10:40.500
<v Speaker 1>No alcohol as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

242
00:10:40.501 --> 00:10:42.060
<v Speaker 1>no alcohol,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no coffee.</v>

243
00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:43.320
<v Speaker 1>Just coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the only,</v>

244
00:10:43.650 --> 00:10:45.330
<v Speaker 1>and even coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of cheating.</v>

245
00:10:45.331 --> 00:10:47.190
<v Speaker 1>I think next time I'm gonna do it with</v>
<v Speaker 1>no coffee.</v>

246
00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:52.550
<v Speaker 1>I think next time because you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whenever I would see those Aa guys and</v>

247
00:10:53.221 --> 00:10:55.650
<v Speaker 1>they'd be smoking cigarettes and just</v>
<v Speaker 1>pounding coffee,</v>

248
00:10:55.651 --> 00:10:56.520
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>

249
00:10:58.290 --> 00:11:01.500
<v Speaker 1>you're doing drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

250
00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:03.600
<v Speaker 1>something in each hand and they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>going,</v>

251
00:11:03.601 --> 00:11:04.291
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been,</v>

252
00:11:04.291 --> 00:11:06.600
<v Speaker 1>I've been off the problems for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

253
00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:08.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

254
00:11:09.370 --> 00:11:11.650
<v Speaker 1>I think you need advice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

255
00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:12.810
<v Speaker 1>you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't.</v>

256
00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:17.040
<v Speaker 1>Maybe there are people who have gone</v>
<v Speaker 1>through this world without having a</v>

257
00:11:17.041 --> 00:11:20.340
<v Speaker 1>vice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think you have to have something,</v>

258
00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:22.500
<v Speaker 1>something that you can go to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to go,</v>

259
00:11:22.501 --> 00:11:26.670
<v Speaker 1>I know this is wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as long as you're not hurting</v>

260
00:11:26.671 --> 00:11:28.350
<v Speaker 1>somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

261
00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:30.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's necessarily wrong,</v>

262
00:11:30.541 --> 00:11:31.290
<v Speaker 1>but I agree with you.</v>

263
00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:34.320
<v Speaker 1>I know what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love that term vice.</v>

264
00:11:34.350 --> 00:11:37.020
<v Speaker 1>It's a very interesting term.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I remember when you would see like</v>

265
00:11:37.021 --> 00:11:40.020
<v Speaker 1>the old cop movies and they would talk</v>
<v Speaker 1>about like the vice unit,</v>

306
00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:27.670
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like this is the problem with the term</v>

307
00:13:27.671 --> 00:13:30.850
<v Speaker 1>drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like drugs could be a cup of coffee or</v>

308
00:13:30.851 --> 00:13:32.410
<v Speaker 1>drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could be crystal meth.</v>

309
00:13:32.830 --> 00:13:34.180
<v Speaker 1>They're both drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

310
00:13:34.710 --> 00:13:36.510
<v Speaker 1>You're going to see a guy smoking a</v>
<v Speaker 1>cigar going,</v>

311
00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:40.630
<v Speaker 1>that guy is wicked.</v>

313
00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:47.050
<v Speaker 1>But we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that term vice is a strange term because</v>

314
00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:49.640
<v Speaker 1>we think of it as like a weakness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we,</v>

315
00:13:49.641 --> 00:13:51.850
<v Speaker 1>we were very embarrassed of our</v>
<v Speaker 1>weaknesses,</v>

316
00:13:51.851 --> 00:13:54.520
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you can get out ahead of him and</v>

317
00:13:54.521 --> 00:13:56.440
<v Speaker 1>then I explain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh well,</v>

318
00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:58.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>coffee's my vice,</v>

319
00:13:58.580 --> 00:13:59.350
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

320
00:13:59.350 --> 00:13:59.831
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

322
00:14:03.190 --> 00:14:04.630
<v Speaker 1>here's your weakness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

323
00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:07.450
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but coffee is a pretty yes.</v>

324
00:14:08.350 --> 00:14:12.040
<v Speaker 1>The most innocuous witness that someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>can cop to.</v>

325
00:14:12.130 --> 00:14:12.963
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

326
00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:15.280
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's probably pretty good for you.</v>

327
00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:19.030
<v Speaker 1>I keep reading so hard to tell cause</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like read one study that says a</v>

328
00:14:19.031 --> 00:14:22.690
<v Speaker 1>cup of coffee a week or a day could keep</v>
<v Speaker 1>you from heart attacks.</v>

329
00:14:22.691 --> 00:14:25.140
<v Speaker 1>Then another one says it takes 10 years</v>
<v Speaker 1>off your life.</v>

330
00:14:25.170 --> 00:14:27.760
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's hard to figure out was</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably the same.</v>

331
00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:31.060
<v Speaker 1>The same line thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like to have a cocktail.</v>

332
00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:32.890
<v Speaker 1>That would be my advice</v>

333
00:14:33.890 --> 00:14:36.080
<v Speaker 1>and a is the wrong word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look up.</v>

334
00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:39.860
<v Speaker 1>How many like the idea to have him one</v>
<v Speaker 1>before you go on stage.</v>

335
00:14:40.010 --> 00:14:42.020
<v Speaker 1>I like to have one shot before I go on</v>
<v Speaker 1>stage.</v>

336
00:14:42.050 --> 00:14:47.050
<v Speaker 1>I do a shot of chilled peach schnapps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would you give very specific before I go</v>

337
00:14:47.541 --> 00:14:49.100
<v Speaker 1>on stage?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's not,</v>

338
00:14:49.130 --> 00:14:52.280
<v Speaker 1>it has nothing to do with the alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like the aspect.</v>

339
00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:55.970
<v Speaker 2>So the people I'm working with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we all do a shot of chilled peach</v>

340
00:14:55.971 --> 00:14:57.140
<v Speaker 2>schnapps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

341
00:14:57.141 --> 00:15:00.170
<v Speaker 2>that's nice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For the ceremony aspect of it.</v>

342
00:15:00.410 --> 00:15:02.000
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's before the show.</v>

343
00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:06.250
<v Speaker 2>After the show I'll have something maybe</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little stronger than a shot of</v>

344
00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:09.140
<v Speaker 2>children,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which knobs to relax and unwind.</v>

345
00:15:09.141 --> 00:15:10.220
<v Speaker 2>I actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

346
00:15:10.270 --> 00:15:12.470
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't drink that often,</v>

347
00:15:12.471 --> 00:15:17.150
<v Speaker 2>but I like to have my occasional night</v>
<v Speaker 2>out with the guys where you go,</v>

348
00:15:17.151 --> 00:15:20.810
<v Speaker 2>where you can kind of go ballistic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fun and I,</v>

<v Speaker 2>We're all in a house.</v>

353
00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:30.890
<v Speaker 2>We're getting lit up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're not hurting anybody.</v>

00:15:31.510 --> 00:15:34.700
<v Speaker 2>I kind of thing I'm with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there's anything wrong</v>

355

<v Speaker 2>with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

356
00:15:35.930 --> 00:15:38.330
<v Speaker 2>what's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who it was Oscar Wilde who said,</v>

357
00:15:38.331 --> 00:15:39.950
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all things in moderation,</v>

358
00:15:39.951 --> 00:15:40.940
<v Speaker 2>including moderation.</v>

359
00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:43.070
<v Speaker 2>Love it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a great term.</v>

360
00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:44.031
<v Speaker 2>Great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>great.</v>

361
00:15:44.031 --> 00:15:45.440
<v Speaker 2>A great quote.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Quote Rather.</v>

362
00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:46.431
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

363
00:15:46.431 --> 00:15:49.310
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's benefits to alcohol.</v>

364
00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:53.330
<v Speaker 2>There's benefits in joy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you pay for it in recovery,</v>

365
00:15:53.570 --> 00:15:57.560
<v Speaker 2>but there's benefits in like bonding,</v>
<v Speaker 2>friendship.</v>

366
00:15:57.830 --> 00:16:01.400
<v Speaker 2>Like some of the most fun times I've had</v>
<v Speaker 2>with my friends has been us hammered.</v>

367
00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:07.180
<v Speaker 2>I remember being in college at a party</v>
<v Speaker 2>and everybody being in a living room</v>

368
00:16:08.090 --> 00:16:10.400
<v Speaker 2>cramped like it was shoulder to</v>
<v Speaker 2>shoulder.</v>

369
00:16:10.430 --> 00:16:15.430
<v Speaker 2>Everyone had beers in their hands and</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone was screaming at the top of</v>

370
00:16:16.491 --> 00:16:17.630
<v Speaker 2>their lungs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like everybody,</v>

371
00:16:17.631 --> 00:16:20.480
<v Speaker 2>like it became like an animalistic</v>
<v Speaker 2>tribal.</v>

372
00:16:20.481 --> 00:16:25.481
<v Speaker 2>Like everybody was just</v>
<v Speaker 2>like 60 people jammed together</v>

373
00:16:25.791 --> 00:16:27.650
<v Speaker 2>screaming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I remember thinking,</v>

374
00:16:28.190 --> 00:16:32.680
<v Speaker 2>is this just the ultimate and bliss?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just a ray,</v>

375
00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:35.630
<v Speaker 2>like an express,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an expression of joy.</v>

376
00:16:36.110 --> 00:16:37.640
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just silly.</v>

377
00:16:37.641 --> 00:16:41.510
<v Speaker 2>It was just silly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was so unbelievably goofy and silly.</v>

378
00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:46.870
<v Speaker 2>What it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's the inhibition inducing quality</v>

379
00:16:47.390 --> 00:16:50.240
<v Speaker 2>of alcohol is very important for those</v>
<v Speaker 2>moments.</v>

380
00:16:50.241 --> 00:16:51.074
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause he just,</v>

381
00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:56.200
<v Speaker 2>it frees you from any concern about how</v>
<v Speaker 2>you look or how you sound or whether or</v>

382
00:16:56.511 --> 00:16:59.000
<v Speaker 2>not you should be behaving this way and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he could just,</v>

383
00:16:59.001 --> 00:17:00.320
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

384
00:17:00.321 --> 00:17:01.760
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I wish,</v>

385
00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:05.810
<v Speaker 2>I wish I could do that without the</v>
<v Speaker 2>alcohol.</v>

386
00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:07.950
<v Speaker 2>But you can't like can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can you get a,</v>

387
00:17:07.951 --> 00:17:09.430
<v Speaker 2>but can I say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

388
00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:12.020
<v Speaker 2>I need 49 people to come over to my</v>
<v Speaker 2>place.</v>

389
00:17:12.580 --> 00:17:15.590
<v Speaker 2>We're going to have some tea and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're all going to get shoulder,</v>

390
00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:19.850
<v Speaker 2>shoulder scream at the top of our lungs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one would do that.</v>

391
00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:21.160
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know the,</v>

392
00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:25.010
<v Speaker 2>the alcohol kind of gives you the</v>
<v Speaker 2>freedom and the goofy to be goofy.</v>

393
00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:26.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it makes you feel like doing that.</v>

394
00:17:27.110 --> 00:17:29.180
<v Speaker 2>Whereas you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you wouldn't feel like doing that if you</v>

395
00:17:29.181 --> 00:17:29.991
<v Speaker 2>were sober.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd be like,</v>

396
00:17:29.991 --> 00:17:31.970
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck is the benefit and</v>
<v Speaker 2>screaming,</v>

397
00:17:32.090 --> 00:17:35.180
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but maybe you do feel like it down deep.</v>

398
00:17:35.740 --> 00:17:37.490
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

399
00:17:37.610 --> 00:17:40.730
<v Speaker 2>I wonder maybe there's something down</v>
<v Speaker 2>deep and then the alcohol brings.</v>

400
00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:42.230
<v Speaker 2>Cause why would you do it when you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>drunk?</v>

401
00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:43.910
<v Speaker 2>That there's something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's something that you want,</v>

402
00:17:44.450 --> 00:17:46.340
<v Speaker 2>there's some reason why you're doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tell you.</v>

403
00:17:46.341 --> 00:17:50.100
<v Speaker 2>One thing that I did find when I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>sober for month is that I would go</v>

404
00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:53.180
<v Speaker 1>out with people who are drinking and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would be unknown.</v>

405
00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:56.100
<v Speaker 1>Yay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>

406
00:17:56.490 --> 00:18:01.440
<v Speaker 1>it's this fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's real hard when you're sober and a</v>

407
00:18:01.441 --> 00:18:04.590
<v Speaker 1>bunch of people around you are just</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking stupid drunk shit.</v>

408
00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:08.760
<v Speaker 1>They're on that vibe and you're not even</v>
<v Speaker 1>close.</v>

409
00:18:08.761 --> 00:18:10.020
<v Speaker 1>Nowhere near that by you look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

412
00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:16.710
<v Speaker 1>everybody has to be on the same page.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

413
00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:19.980
<v Speaker 1>Everybody has to be at the same,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same level of goofiness.</v>

414
00:18:20.250 --> 00:18:22.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're dating someone that</v>

00:18:22.471 --> 00:18:25.740
<v Speaker 1>doesn't drink and you're a drinker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that could be a real issue.</v>

416
00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:27.710
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you start getting hammered and they</v>

<v Speaker 2>like you always look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at it can keep a look out.</v>

469
00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:53.290
<v Speaker 2>Anybody can come in anytime and start</v>
<v Speaker 2>kicking someone's ass.</v>

470
00:20:53.291 --> 00:20:55.780
<v Speaker 2>He was going to be looking to run out</v>
<v Speaker 2>the door.</v>

471
00:20:56.500 --> 00:21:00.340
<v Speaker 2>The Wa there's like something about</v>
<v Speaker 2>waffle houses after 1:00 AM where the</v>

472
00:21:00.341 --> 00:21:03.160
<v Speaker 2>possibility of fights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it goes through the roof.</v>

473
00:21:03.850 --> 00:21:08.050
<v Speaker 2>The graph just goes up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You always had to be looking for fights.</v>

474
00:21:08.051 --> 00:21:12.010
<v Speaker 2>Like at any moment one could break out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you have like sizzler steakhouse at</v>

475
00:21:12.011 --> 00:21:17.011
<v Speaker 2>6:00 PM to waffle house at 4:00 AM and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the graph just goes through is that</v>

476
00:21:17.651 --> 00:21:21.160
<v Speaker 2>fights at waffle house?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So many of them,</v>

477
00:21:21.930 --> 00:21:26.930
<v Speaker 2>I realized there was actual like web</v>
<v Speaker 2>page dedicated to waffle house videos.</v>

478
00:21:27.670 --> 00:21:30.330
<v Speaker 2>They've seen somebody like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy's got scars all over his face.</v>

479
00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:32.440
<v Speaker 2>See that guy right next to curse Jesus</v>
<v Speaker 2>Christ.</v>

480
00:21:32.441 --> 00:21:35.320
<v Speaker 2>He got beat up at the waffle house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

481
00:21:35.530 --> 00:21:37.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Waffle house is just something about</v>

482
00:21:37.931 --> 00:21:38.764
<v Speaker 2>that place.</v>

483
00:21:38.950 --> 00:21:42.580
<v Speaker 2>It's 24 hours a day and the alcohol,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

484
00:21:42.581 --> 00:21:45.250
<v Speaker 2>The amount of people that are coming in</v>
<v Speaker 2>drunk is through the roof.</v>

485
00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:50.680
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if at some waffle House meeting</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody propose what we should close at</v>

486
00:21:50.740 --> 00:21:55.740
<v Speaker 2>one 1:00 AM then we're going to cut out</v>
<v Speaker 2>95% of our profits because everybody</v>

487
00:21:59.051 --> 00:22:03.640
<v Speaker 2>comes in after 1:00 AM yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That would be a terrible move this close</v>

488
00:22:03.641 --> 00:22:06.670
<v Speaker 2>at 1:00 AM and see what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That'd be like tiger woods chopping his</v>

489
00:22:06.671 --> 00:22:09.040
<v Speaker 2>fucking arms off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got a stupid idea.</v>

490
00:22:09.041 --> 00:22:12.700
<v Speaker 2>Is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's so dumb.</v>

491
00:22:13.150 --> 00:22:14.710
<v Speaker 2>That's a dumb idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

492
00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:17.710
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they must embrace the drunks,</v>

493
00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:18.890
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

494
00:22:19.250 --> 00:22:21.430
<v Speaker 2>Hangover remedies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what else is really good,</v>

495
00:22:21.490 --> 00:22:25.600
<v Speaker 2>really late at night,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you could find a legit Mexican joint,</v>

496
00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:29.380
<v Speaker 2>like a legit one where they barely speak</v>
<v Speaker 2>English.</v>

497
00:22:30.130 --> 00:22:35.080
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was at a place in Dallas and there was</v>

498
00:22:35.090 --> 00:22:39.610
<v Speaker 2>a late night place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a Chinese restaurant where they would</v>

499
00:22:39.611 --> 00:22:42.580
<v Speaker 2>serve alcohol after alcohol was supposed</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be closed.</v>

500
00:22:42.710 --> 00:22:44.560
<v Speaker 2>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And everybody sold tea.</v>

501
00:22:44.950 --> 00:22:46.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the cool place to go to.</v>

502
00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:50.380
<v Speaker 2>And you go there and everybody's on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>down low and they serve alcohol.</v>

503
00:22:50.381 --> 00:22:52.960
<v Speaker 2>But like in tea cups.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

504
00:22:53.050 --> 00:22:54.340
<v Speaker 2>They call it cold tea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

505
00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:55.630
<v Speaker 2>Something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

506
00:22:55.830 --> 00:22:59.050
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the place was packed and everybody had</v>

507
00:22:59.140 --> 00:23:00.790
<v Speaker 2>booze.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

508
00:23:02.430 --> 00:23:05.290
<v Speaker 2>this is really a secret to the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the police.</v>

509
00:23:05.291 --> 00:23:10.291
<v Speaker 2>Like the police don't know this place is</v>
<v Speaker 2>packed at three o'clock in the morning</v>

510
00:23:10.661 --> 00:23:12.760
<v Speaker 2>and we're all here to drink tea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

511
00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:16.750
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>apparently somebody said the cops are</v>

512
00:23:16.751 --> 00:23:18.640
<v Speaker 2>coming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like arrayed was happening.</v>

513
00:23:18.641 --> 00:23:23.641
<v Speaker 2>I guess maybe they saw him pulling into</v>
<v Speaker 2>the parking lot and an old Asian guy ran</v>

514
00:23:23.681 --> 00:23:27.580
<v Speaker 2>around all the tables throwing fish on</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody's table.</v>

515
00:23:28.750 --> 00:23:33.400
<v Speaker 2>And he was saying food saying tell him I</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't want to do an Asian accident cause</v>

516
00:23:33.401 --> 00:23:34.600
<v Speaker 2>it'll sound racist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he was saying,</v>

517
00:23:34.660 --> 00:23:37.870
<v Speaker 2>tell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tell the police you're eating the fish</v>

518
00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:40.630
<v Speaker 2>telling everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tell him you're eating the fish.</v>

519
00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:45.070
<v Speaker 2>Tell him eating a fish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This big Jane Fish on our plate like</v>

520
00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:46.130
<v Speaker 2>that would fool the cops.</v>

521
00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:51.140
<v Speaker 1>Like everybody has the same giant giant</v>
<v Speaker 1>fish on their plate and a cup of tea.</v>

522
00:23:51.310 --> 00:23:55.310
<v Speaker 1>We just all had a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a craving for this at three</v>

523
00:23:55.311 --> 00:23:56.780
<v Speaker 1>o'clock in the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of us.</v>

524
00:23:56.810 --> 00:23:59.840
<v Speaker 1>It's a social place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>

525
00:23:59.841 --> 00:24:01.880
<v Speaker 1>They had that many fish cooked ready to</v>
<v Speaker 1>go.</v>

526
00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:05.330
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know if they were cooked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he was just scrambling to try to</v>

527
00:24:05.331 --> 00:24:07.640
<v Speaker 1>cover what was going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chinatown in Boston?</v>

528
00:24:07.641 --> 00:24:08.181
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's had that.</v>

529
00:24:08.181 --> 00:24:12.470
<v Speaker 1>We would do shows at like nick's comedy</v>
<v Speaker 1>stop and then we'd go to a chinatown</v>

530
00:24:12.471 --> 00:24:14.720
<v Speaker 1>which is like right down the street and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

531
00:24:14.721 --> 00:24:17.660
<v Speaker 1>they serve cold tea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can drink beer late at night.</v>

532
00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:20.450
<v Speaker 1>I think I've been in that place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I say you have quite a few of those.</v>

533
00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:21.590
<v Speaker 1>Comedians will go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

534
00:24:21.591 --> 00:24:23.060
<v Speaker 1>we've got a place we can go to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

535
00:24:23.061 --> 00:24:24.350
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wish I could remember the name of the</v>

536
00:24:24.351 --> 00:24:26.780
<v Speaker 1>places,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but good Chinese food too.</v>

537
00:24:26.780 --> 00:24:29.000
<v Speaker 1>Like real serious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>legit Chinese food.</v>

538
00:24:29.870 --> 00:24:30.800
<v Speaker 1>And you would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

539
00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:34.400
<v Speaker 1>you would also get beer late at night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They must've had some sort of a deal</v>

540
00:24:34.401 --> 00:24:37.820
<v Speaker 1>with the cops because I knew about it</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was like 18.</v>

541
00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:40.970
<v Speaker 1>So if I knew about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't imagine that escaped the police</v>

542
00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:43.940
<v Speaker 1>and the entire police force was</v>
<v Speaker 1>oblivious.</v>

543
00:24:44.690 --> 00:24:49.690
<v Speaker 1>Joe Rogan knows about this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the entire police force is oblivious</v>

544
00:24:50.511 --> 00:24:54.150
<v Speaker 1>to the fact that this happening in their</v>
<v Speaker 1>town high,</v>

545
00:24:54.350 --> 00:24:57.710
<v Speaker 1>highly unlikely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is weird though that there's rules</v>

546
00:24:57.711 --> 00:24:58.544
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

547
00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:02.720
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the things that I like</v>
<v Speaker 1>about Vegas is that Vegas allows you to</v>

548
00:25:02.721 --> 00:25:04.460
<v Speaker 1>drink whenever you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your grown adult,</v>

549
00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:07.310
<v Speaker 1>if you want to have a beer at five</v>
<v Speaker 1>o'clock in the morning,</v>

550
00:25:07.460 --> 00:25:09.320
<v Speaker 1>it's totally legal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you want to have a beer,</v>

551
00:25:09.321 --> 00:25:12.200
<v Speaker 1>it's seven o'clock in the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's legal to decide for yourself.</v>

552
00:25:12.230 --> 00:25:16.010
<v Speaker 1>There's no like magical hour where</v>
<v Speaker 1>alcohol becomes okay.</v>

553
00:25:17.090 --> 00:25:20.030
<v Speaker 1>I agree with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I also understand the,</v>

554
00:25:20.031 --> 00:25:24.560
<v Speaker 1>not wanting everybody to get on the road</v>
<v Speaker 1>behind a wheel,</v>

555
00:25:24.740 --> 00:25:25.311
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

556
00:25:25.311 --> 00:25:27.080
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>aspect.</v>

557
00:25:27.250 --> 00:25:28.083
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But does that,</v>

558
00:25:28.370 --> 00:25:30.830
<v Speaker 1>does that really save any money?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because at the end of the day,</v>

559
00:25:30.890 --> 00:25:34.250
<v Speaker 1>like if you're drunk at midnight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're drunk at midnight,</v>

560
00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:36.830
<v Speaker 1>how are you going to get home?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to wait till two in the</v>

561
00:25:36.831 --> 00:25:38.420
<v Speaker 1>morning and then drive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that the idea of,</v>

562
00:25:38.421 --> 00:25:39.590
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're still going to be drunk.</v>

563
00:25:40.050 --> 00:25:41.900
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're out there driving and you're</v>

564
00:25:41.901 --> 00:25:43.880
<v Speaker 1>drunk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're driving drunk period,</v>

565
00:25:43.881 --> 00:25:48.881
<v Speaker 1>there's no real work around for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if it happens at 11:00 PM or if it</v>

566
00:25:48.951 --> 00:25:53.951
<v Speaker 1>happens at 5:00 AM it's really the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>situation unless you factor where you're</v>

567
00:25:54.051 --> 00:25:56.900
<v Speaker 1>going to be more drunk even later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what I mean,</v>

568
00:25:57.290 --> 00:25:58.130
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess so,</v>

569
00:25:58.131 --> 00:25:58.964
<v Speaker 1>but I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>

570
00:25:59.270 --> 00:26:02.840
<v Speaker 1>what percentage of people that leave</v>
<v Speaker 1>clubs or driving drunk,</v>

571
00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:07.610
<v Speaker 1>it's gotta be in the high seventies and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just drive,</v>

572
00:26:07.730 --> 00:26:11.900
<v Speaker 1>you know what I like today is like lyft</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Uber that people are using these</v>

573
00:26:11.950 --> 00:26:13.490
<v Speaker 1>ride sharing thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

574
00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:16.250
<v Speaker 1>that is gigantic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I would imagine that's probably</v>

575
00:26:16.251 --> 00:26:19.730
<v Speaker 1>saved a lot of people accidents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be good to know.</v>

576
00:26:20.150 --> 00:26:23.510
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you've had to listen to a lot of</v>

577
00:26:23.511 --> 00:26:28.511
<v Speaker 1>like really stupid stories from drivers</v>
<v Speaker 1>and like had weird conversations with</v>

578
00:26:28.791 --> 00:26:29.810
<v Speaker 1>these people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

579
00:26:29.820 --> 00:26:31.170
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I won't,</v>

580
00:26:31.260 --> 00:26:35.720
<v Speaker 1>I have not been in a lot of Uber's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they tend to like to talk about</v>

581
00:26:35.721 --> 00:26:40.280
<v Speaker 1>their ratings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll do that because that's what they</v>

582
00:26:40.281 --> 00:26:44.250
<v Speaker 1>survive on is you're going to rate them</v>
<v Speaker 1>so</v>

583
00:26:44.250 --> 00:26:47.640
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they want to float the subject that</v>

584
00:26:47.670 --> 00:26:49.500
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be rating them when they</v>
<v Speaker 2>get out.</v>

585
00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:51.050
<v Speaker 2>And they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

586
00:26:51.050 --> 00:26:53.940
<v Speaker 2>I've heard a disproportionate amount of</v>
<v Speaker 2>uber drivers say,</v>

587
00:26:53.941 --> 00:26:55.050
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

588
00:26:55.051 --> 00:26:57.690
<v Speaker 2>I usually get good ratings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had this one person who I thought I</v>

589
00:26:57.691 --> 00:26:59.940
<v Speaker 2>had done a good job for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

590
00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:02.240
<v Speaker 2>give me a bad rating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think they're,</v>

591
00:27:02.270 --> 00:27:04.620
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're pumping you to get out and give</v>

592
00:27:04.621 --> 00:27:08.190
<v Speaker 2>them a whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the highest number of stars you should</v>

593
00:27:08.191 --> 00:27:09.510
<v Speaker 2>get ahead of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you get in the car,</v>

594
00:27:09.511 --> 00:27:10.110
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>

595
00:27:10.110 --> 00:27:12.030
<v Speaker 2>here's the deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll give you five stars.</v>

596
00:27:12.031 --> 00:27:13.130
<v Speaker 2>Just don't talk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get me there.</v>

597
00:27:13.350 --> 00:27:14.610
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought,</v>

598
00:27:14.620 --> 00:27:16.950
<v Speaker 2>let's go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He'll play any crazy music,</v>

599
00:27:18.350 --> 00:27:20.340
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're starting at fivestars.</v>

600
00:27:20.341 --> 00:27:21.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>

601
00:27:21.150 --> 00:27:23.070
<v Speaker 2>you're already there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just leave me alone.</v>

602
00:27:23.071 --> 00:27:24.750
<v Speaker 2>Just leave me alone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just leave me alone.</v>

603
00:27:24.751 --> 00:27:26.190
<v Speaker 2>Let me be in some of my own head.</v>

604
00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:29.700
<v Speaker 2>If you talk about ratings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that knocks the star off.</v>

605
00:27:30.110 --> 00:27:30.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

606
00:27:30.930 --> 00:27:34.080
<v Speaker 2>It becomes a problem when when there's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>forced conversation always,</v>

607
00:27:34.110 --> 00:27:36.000
<v Speaker 2>and if you're paying for that force</v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation,</v>

608
00:27:36.001 --> 00:27:36.780
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

609
00:27:36.780 --> 00:27:39.300
<v Speaker 2>it's one thing like you want to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>cordial and you want to be friendly.</v>

610
00:27:39.301 --> 00:27:39.691
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

611
00:27:39.691 --> 00:27:40.800
<v Speaker 2>how you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nice to meet you.</v>

612
00:27:40.850 --> 00:27:41.683
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cool.</v>

613
00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:46.700
<v Speaker 2>But then if they start interviewing you</v>
<v Speaker 2>car service people from years of doing</v>

614
00:27:47.851 --> 00:27:49.580
<v Speaker 2>this there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's two kinds there.</v>

615
00:27:49.590 --> 00:27:54.030
<v Speaker 2>The kinds of drivers who they don't want</v>
<v Speaker 2>to talk to anybody,</v>

616
00:27:54.150 --> 00:27:56.430
<v Speaker 2>they they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why they liked this kind of job.</v>

617
00:27:56.460 --> 00:28:00.990
<v Speaker 2>They don't have to talk to anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you have the type of driver who</v>

618
00:28:01.530 --> 00:28:03.870
<v Speaker 2>likes a captive audience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ooh.</v>

619
00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:07.830
<v Speaker 2>And they will not stop talking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what a real problem has been?</v>

620
00:28:08.310 --> 00:28:12.120
<v Speaker 2>If me and my friends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I say we get a car service in the road</v>

621
00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:15.690
<v Speaker 2>and we're having like a serious</v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation and then they interrupt and</v>

622
00:28:15.691 --> 00:28:17.970
<v Speaker 2>start chiming in like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

623
00:28:18.330 --> 00:28:21.720
<v Speaker 2>well I think the problem is that women</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't understand what men really want.</v>

624
00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:24.210
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck is this guy?</v>

625
00:28:24.270 --> 00:28:26.040
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are you doing?</v>

626
00:28:26.070 --> 00:28:27.970
<v Speaker 2>And if it's like really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

627
00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:30.840
<v Speaker 2>politically weighted or something like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

628
00:28:30.841 --> 00:28:34.350
<v Speaker 2>you're going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're driving me three miles and I</v>

629
00:28:34.351 --> 00:28:36.330
<v Speaker 2>don't want to get into a political,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not tit for tat.</v>

630
00:28:36.570 --> 00:28:40.980
<v Speaker 2>I got an a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got an a cab in Las Vegas and I was</v>

631
00:28:40.981 --> 00:28:44.280
<v Speaker 2>going to the Las Vegas Hilton and I get</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the back and I said,</v>

632
00:28:44.281 --> 00:28:45.900
<v Speaker 2>Las Vegas Hilton.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was already on the strip.</v>

633
00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:47.800
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

634
00:28:48.810 --> 00:28:50.100
<v Speaker 2>I'm not making this up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

635
00:28:50.130 --> 00:28:51.120
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not too far.</v>

636
00:28:51.121 --> 00:28:56.121
<v Speaker 2>That won't be too much of a problem for</v>
<v Speaker 2>my anus.</v>

637
00:28:57.780 --> 00:28:59.910
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>excuse me.</v>

638
00:28:59.970 --> 00:29:02.460
<v Speaker 2>He used the word anus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to think of another word.</v>

639
00:29:02.461 --> 00:29:04.320
<v Speaker 2>He used it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't say ass.</v>

640
00:29:04.980 --> 00:29:06.690
<v Speaker 2>Is there another word between ass and</v>
<v Speaker 2>anus?</v>

641
00:29:07.710 --> 00:29:08.700
<v Speaker 2>Rectum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

642
00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:10.980
<v Speaker 2>my wreck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he said it was something like</v>

643
00:29:10.981 --> 00:29:12.500
<v Speaker 2>rectum,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

644
00:29:13.410 --> 00:29:16.380
<v Speaker 2>forcing me into the following question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

645
00:29:16.381 --> 00:29:18.480
<v Speaker 2>what's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's with your,</v>

646
00:29:19.140 --> 00:29:22.740
<v Speaker 2>with your rectum now you've got an end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said that he had had an operation.</v>

647
00:29:22.741 --> 00:29:27.600
<v Speaker 2>He had recently had an operation and</v>
<v Speaker 2>long drives are challenging for them,</v>

648
00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:31.800
<v Speaker 2>but my drive over to the Las Vegas</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hilton isn't too long,</v>

649
00:29:31.801 --> 00:29:35.400
<v Speaker 2>so there won't be too uncomfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I found it quite odd that I had</v>

650
00:29:35.401 --> 00:29:40.401
<v Speaker 2>known this man for five seconds and we</v>
<v Speaker 2>were talking about that part of his</v>

651
00:29:40.561 --> 00:29:41.530
<v Speaker 2>body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

652
00:29:41.531 --> 00:29:41.980
<v Speaker 2>You got to get</v>

653
00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:44.380
<v Speaker 1>ahead of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When a guy like that says something like</v>

654
00:29:44.381 --> 00:29:44.950
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got to go,</v>

655
00:29:44.950 --> 00:29:45.783
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

656
00:29:48.010 --> 00:29:50.920
<v Speaker 1>Well I'll go talk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>grow the amount of space for me to drive</v>

657
00:29:50.970 --> 00:29:53.380
<v Speaker 1>or don't have to worry about my rectum</v>
<v Speaker 1>fallen out.</v>

658
00:29:53.650 --> 00:29:54.483
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cool.</v>

659
00:29:55.030 --> 00:29:57.130
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're better at these things than I am.</v>

660
00:29:57.550 --> 00:29:59.110
<v Speaker 1>I deal with a lot more dumb people than</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do.</v>

661
00:29:59.140 --> 00:30:00.340
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

662
00:30:00.370 --> 00:30:04.390
<v Speaker 1>from doing fear factor for six years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got a phd in questionable humans.</v>

663
00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:12.250
<v Speaker 1>Most of them were wonderful people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

664
00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:13.930
<v Speaker 1>every show I had to deal with one</v>
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>

665
00:30:13.931 --> 00:30:17.110
<v Speaker 1>Like what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

666
00:30:17.230 --> 00:30:21.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how did you do?</v>

667
00:30:22.630 --> 00:30:24.700
<v Speaker 1>You did that for awhile and then they</v>
<v Speaker 1>brought it back.</v>

668
00:30:25.060 --> 00:30:30.060
<v Speaker 1>They brought it back for seven episodes</v>
<v Speaker 1>but only six aired because the seventh</v>

669
00:30:31.841 --> 00:30:35.110
<v Speaker 1>one week we had people drink calm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ah Huh.</v>

670
00:30:35.610 --> 00:30:38.640
<v Speaker 1>And that killed the show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Second time I was actually happy I</v>

671
00:30:38.660 --> 00:30:41.530
<v Speaker 1>killed the second time because a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a mistake.</v>

672
00:30:41.890 --> 00:30:42.970
<v Speaker 1>My Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should have done it,</v>

673
00:30:43.540 --> 00:30:47.380
<v Speaker 1>but it was a bunch of old friends like</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people that were producing it.</v>

674
00:30:47.410 --> 00:30:50.830
<v Speaker 1>We're good friends and it was the</v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunity to work with them and it was</v>

675
00:30:50.831 --> 00:30:53.500
<v Speaker 1>a shitload of money and it was like I</v>
<v Speaker 1>just got talked into it.</v>

676
00:30:53.501 --> 00:30:54.370
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come on,</v>

677
00:30:54.371 --> 00:30:55.270
<v Speaker 1>it'll be fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

678
00:30:56.650 --> 00:30:57.670
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you talking about the whole experience?</v>

679
00:30:57.671 --> 00:31:01.320
<v Speaker 1>I thought you meant the particular</v>
<v Speaker 1>episode where had no,</v>

680
00:31:01.710 --> 00:31:03.910
<v Speaker 1>now the particular episode,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't fucking believe it when they</v>

681
00:31:03.911 --> 00:31:05.620
<v Speaker 1>said that's what they were supposed to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

682
00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:10.920
<v Speaker 1>I went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what human or from a mule mule com we</v>

683
00:31:12.011 --> 00:31:13.750
<v Speaker 1>actually discussed this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not so bad.</v>

684
00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:18.030
<v Speaker 1>We actually discussed this yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oddly enough with Eliza,</v>

685
00:31:18.910 --> 00:31:19.840
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean to cover,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

686
00:31:19.841 --> 00:31:21.580
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe it's coming up two days</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a row,</v>

687
00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:24.850
<v Speaker 1>but that happens sometimes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like subjects come in waves and it's</v>

688
00:31:24.851 --> 00:31:27.250
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if I bring them up for whatever</v>

689
00:31:27.251 --> 00:31:28.810
<v Speaker 1>reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they come in waves.</v>

690
00:31:28.850 --> 00:31:31.480
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't mean to force you into bringing</v>

691
00:31:31.481 --> 00:31:32.500
<v Speaker 1>up that subject again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

692
00:31:32.501 --> 00:31:34.870
<v Speaker 1>the other problem with the second season</v>
<v Speaker 1>of fear factor,</v>

693
00:31:34.871 --> 00:31:36.520
<v Speaker 1>and I can say this now because it didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>happen,</v>

694
00:31:36.521 --> 00:31:38.080
<v Speaker 1>is I was worried we're going to kill</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody.</v>

695
00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:41.320
<v Speaker 1>I was really worried.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it seemed too dangerous.</v>

696
00:31:41.610 --> 00:31:45.430
<v Speaker 1>Like they were ramping up the stunts and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were making things like way more</v>

697
00:31:45.431 --> 00:31:49.480
<v Speaker 1>spectacular and you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just taking bigger chances and</v>

698
00:31:49.510 --> 00:31:51.460
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a lot of downtime in between</v>

699
00:31:51.461 --> 00:31:53.170
<v Speaker 1>starts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a lot of preparation,</v>

700
00:31:53.171 --> 00:31:55.540
<v Speaker 1>there was a lot of like checks and</v>
<v Speaker 1>balances and they,</v>

701
00:31:55.810 --> 00:31:59.100
<v Speaker 1>they really wanted to make sure that</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything was tested and double tested</v>

702
00:31:59.110 --> 00:32:02.410
<v Speaker 1>and they really mapped it out well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was still,</v>

703
00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:05.440
<v Speaker 1>there were some hair raising things he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking people how to do.</v>

704
00:32:05.740 --> 00:32:10.740
<v Speaker 1>Maybe fear was too far.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it should have been like mildly</v>

705
00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:15.340
<v Speaker 1>uncomfortable factor where you put</v>
<v Speaker 1>people like in mildly uncomfortable</v>

706
00:32:15.341 --> 00:32:17.590
<v Speaker 1>situations like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

707
00:32:17.591 --> 00:32:20.380
<v Speaker 1>I want you to go over and talk to that</v>
<v Speaker 1>woman.</v>

708
00:32:20.380 --> 00:32:23.860
<v Speaker 1>She seems kind of attractive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

709
00:32:23.890 --> 00:32:28.860
<v Speaker 1>And so it's kind of a mildly</v>
<v Speaker 1>uncomfortable and the no one's going to</v>

710
00:32:28.870 --> 00:32:30.330
<v Speaker 1>die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one's going to,</v>

711
00:32:30.770 --> 00:32:32.240
<v Speaker 1>they might,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if she kills you there,</v>

712
00:32:32.250 --> 00:32:34.780
<v Speaker 1>there's um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're doing a new one with ludicrous.</v>

713
00:32:34.781 --> 00:32:38.140
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a new fear factor and ludicrous.</v>

714
00:32:38.141 --> 00:32:41.960
<v Speaker 1>The rapper is the host and like some of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fears of like forgetting your cell</v>

715
00:32:41.961 --> 00:32:44.600
<v Speaker 1>phone somewhere like for like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

716
00:32:44.630 --> 00:32:45.860
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something stupid like that.</v>

717
00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:47.660
<v Speaker 1>And they don't have to eat anything</v>
<v Speaker 1>gross.</v>

718
00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:49.490
<v Speaker 1>Mm hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which was a,</v>

719
00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:53.240
<v Speaker 1>it was really dumped and keep that out</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that was one of the most popular</v>

720
00:32:53.241 --> 00:32:56.990
<v Speaker 1>parts of the original series that was</v>
<v Speaker 1>gigantic.</v>

721
00:32:56.991 --> 00:33:01.310
<v Speaker 1>Like the eating gross shit part as huge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to be honest with you.</v>

722
00:33:01.311 --> 00:33:03.320
<v Speaker 1>That was the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't watch that.</v>

723
00:33:03.890 --> 00:33:05.540
<v Speaker 1>That was the hard part for I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

724
00:33:05.930 --> 00:33:06.763
<v Speaker 1>I hear you.</v>

725
00:33:06.830 --> 00:33:10.610
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was hard for me to watch somebody do</v>

726
00:33:10.611 --> 00:33:14.540
<v Speaker 1>something cause I wouldn't eat it or</v>
<v Speaker 1>drink it and I don't want to watch</v>

727
00:33:14.541 --> 00:33:15.800
<v Speaker 1>somebody else do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's,</v>

728
00:33:15.810 --> 00:33:16.940
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm with you.</v>

729
00:33:17.420 --> 00:33:19.550
<v Speaker 1>I mean I wouldn't have won.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's not true.</v>

730
00:33:20.030 --> 00:33:20.890
<v Speaker 1>I watched,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

731
00:33:20.930 --> 00:33:25.930
<v Speaker 1>somebody sent me a clip of Steevo with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>gas mask on and I tweeted it,</v>

732
00:33:29.060 --> 00:33:34.060
<v Speaker 1>some guy farting into a tube and it goes</v>
<v Speaker 1>right in the Steve O's face and he threw</v>

733
00:33:34.491 --> 00:33:38.240
<v Speaker 1>up into the mask and I laughed so hard</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I retweeted it</v>

<v Speaker 1>and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you send it to me.</v>

735

<v Speaker 1>but it was in response to Eliza</v>

<v Speaker 1>make some real entertainment.</v>

752
00:34:53.010 --> 00:34:56.500
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean wonder what I mean that's,</v>

753
00:34:56.530 --> 00:34:57.520
<v Speaker 1>that's a real question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

754
00:34:57.521 --> 00:34:59.830
<v Speaker 1>Like what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would people have done?</v>

755
00:34:59.831 --> 00:35:03.550
<v Speaker 1>Like some of the great works,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people that created like amazing</v>

756
00:35:03.551 --> 00:35:08.530
<v Speaker 1>music where they composed incredible</v>
<v Speaker 1>music or they wrote great books or</v>

757
00:35:08.531 --> 00:35:09.160
<v Speaker 1>poetry.</v>

758
00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:12.100
<v Speaker 1>There wasn't a lot of outlets for your</v>
<v Speaker 1>creativity back then.</v>

759
00:35:12.130 --> 00:35:13.720
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't even stand up comedy.</v>

760
00:35:13.721 --> 00:35:16.750
<v Speaker 1>There was no music videos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was nothing that you could do.</v>

761
00:35:17.490 --> 00:35:20.170
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we take for granted today.</v>

762
00:35:20.230 --> 00:35:22.050
<v Speaker 1>It's so commonplace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

763
00:35:22.051 --> 00:35:23.650
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you really stop and think about it,</v>

764
00:35:24.370 --> 00:35:26.320
<v Speaker 1>but I mean it's gone too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

765
00:35:26.321 --> 00:35:28.720
<v Speaker 1>that's the extreme,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's like,</v>

766
00:35:28.721 --> 00:35:31.480
<v Speaker 1>how do you go steve o's a fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>maniac.</v>

767
00:35:31.481 --> 00:35:33.490
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like that.</v>

768
00:35:33.491 --> 00:35:35.560
<v Speaker 1>All different kinds of things that get</v>
<v Speaker 1>explored.</v>

769
00:35:35.561 --> 00:35:36.341
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I truly do.</v>

770
00:35:36.341 --> 00:35:37.620
<v Speaker 1>I like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

771
00:35:37.621 --> 00:35:40.290
<v Speaker 1>somebody wants to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but people can be entertained by that.</v>

772
00:35:40.470 --> 00:35:44.910
<v Speaker 1>But it's definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's sort of the end of the line,</v>

773
00:35:44.911 --> 00:35:45.840
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

776
00:35:48.660 --> 00:35:50.370

<v Speaker 1>steve?</v>

777
00:35:50.371 --> 00:35:51.300
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll find it.</v>

778

<v Speaker 1>Like you,</v>

779
00:35:53.230 --> 00:35:55.020
<v Speaker 1>I was with him in Vegas a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 1>weeks ago.</v>

780
00:35:55.020 --> 00:35:57.500
<v Speaker 1>He came to the UFC and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

781
00:35:57.530 --> 00:36:00.120

<v Speaker 1>and we're hanging in,</v>

782
00:36:00.570 --> 00:36:03.870
<v Speaker 1>we're hanging out and he's telling me</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these things that he's planning on</v>

783
00:36:03.871 --> 00:36:04.671
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm,</v>

784
00:36:04.671 --> 00:36:08.500
<v Speaker 1>I light myself on fire and then I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to jump into traffic and then I'm</v>

785
00:36:08.501 --> 00:36:11.730
<v Speaker 1>going to pop port wire around my deck</v>
<v Speaker 1>and now I'm like,</v>

786
00:36:11.731 --> 00:36:12.410
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why,</v>

787
00:36:12.410 --> 00:36:15.210
<v Speaker 1>why are you doing all this man?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then a guy's going to hit me with a</v>

788
00:36:15.211 --> 00:36:17.400
<v Speaker 1>paddle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why those things are written in a</v>

789
00:36:17.401 --> 00:36:18.120
<v Speaker 1>notebook.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

790
00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:20.850
<v Speaker 1>well he's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's always got to take it to another</v>

791
00:36:20.851 --> 00:36:23.850
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Know he recently had to cancel shows in</v>

792
00:36:23.851 --> 00:36:28.530
<v Speaker 1>Denver because he lit himself on fire</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>

793
00:36:28.610 --> 00:36:31.920
<v Speaker 1>the burns were so bad that when he went</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the doctor,</v>

794
00:36:32.040 --> 00:36:33.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he just wanted to get treated.</v>

795
00:36:33.541 --> 00:36:34.500
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in pain.</v>

796
00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:35.281
<v Speaker 1>They were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

797
00:36:35.281 --> 00:36:36.090
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Like immediately.</v>

799
00:36:39.240 --> 00:36:42.300
<v Speaker 1>And so he got to get skin grafts like</v>
<v Speaker 1>all over his arms.</v>

800
00:36:42.330 --> 00:36:43.560
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like look at that.</v>

801

<v Speaker 1>blisters and that's all,</v>

802
00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:51.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>massive burns.</v>

803
00:36:52.290 --> 00:36:56.700

806
00:37:02.550 --> 00:37:04.470
<v Speaker 1>I think he was at the comedy works in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Denver.</v>

807
00:37:04.590 --> 00:37:06.240
<v Speaker 1>Look at that.</v>

808
00:37:06.241 --> 00:37:09.090
<v Speaker 1>look at all the liquid in his skin when</v>
<v Speaker 1>he moves up to that again,</v>

809
00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:10.500
<v Speaker 1>pulled out again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>

00:37:13.921 --> 00:37:18.180
<v Speaker 1>Like how you could see the all the pus</v>
<v Speaker 1>roll back and forth and that's quite</v>

813
00:37:18.181 --> 00:37:21.030
<v Speaker 1>fascinating for whatever reason why I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>interested in that.</v>

814
00:37:22.780 --> 00:37:24.690
<v Speaker 1>So that doesn't interest you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

815
00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:27.290
<v Speaker 1>You're in a sensible guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brian Regan what you get?</v>

816
00:37:27.310 --> 00:37:28.470
<v Speaker 1>Sell some tickets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might.</v>

817
00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:30.120
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

818
00:37:30.150 --> 00:37:33.300
<v Speaker 1>That's his thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be in San Diego and in</v>

819
00:37:33.301 --> 00:37:37.710
<v Speaker 1>between shows I'm going to be a lighting</v>
<v Speaker 1>myself on fire and having like a body</v>

820
00:37:37.711 --> 00:37:41.760
<v Speaker 1>fluids in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in sacks of pus hanging from my arms.</v>

821
00:37:41.850 --> 00:37:46.680
<v Speaker 1>You're going video tape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It will sure be hard to just write about</v>

822
00:37:46.681 --> 00:37:47.810
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did he did it until he,</v>

823
00:37:47.850 --> 00:37:50.010
<v Speaker 1>for one fan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know it was like a personal</v>

824
00:37:50.011 --> 00:37:51.930
<v Speaker 1>experience like no one else needs to</v>
<v Speaker 1>know.</v>

825
00:37:51.931 --> 00:37:55.590
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to light myself on fire</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I'm going to get burns and I'm</v>

826
00:37:55.591 --> 00:37:59.310
<v Speaker 1>going to do like this little puss dance</v>
<v Speaker 1>just for one person.</v>

827
00:37:59.311 --> 00:38:01.350
<v Speaker 1>It's very intimate and personal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me,</v>

828
00:38:01.351 --> 00:38:02.430
<v Speaker 1>let me think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to,</v>

829
00:38:02.431 --> 00:38:04.830
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to mull it over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to mull that one over.</v>

830
00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:06.840
<v Speaker 1>What do you do for fun man?</v>

831
00:38:07.020 --> 00:38:09.240
<v Speaker 1>Besides play golf.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you have any weird interests?</v>

832
00:38:10.180 --> 00:38:14.400
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like watching police chases on</v>

833
00:38:14.401 --> 00:38:16.190
<v Speaker 1>youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you,</v>

834
00:38:17.740 --> 00:38:20.100
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What bothers me is when they put the end</v>

835
00:38:20.101 --> 00:38:21.930
<v Speaker 1>and the explanation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>

836
00:38:22.470 --> 00:38:24.240
<v Speaker 1>I hate that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want,</v>

837
00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:27.000
<v Speaker 1>it's a little drama.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how it's going to end.</v>

838
00:38:27.001 --> 00:38:27.781
<v Speaker 1>Don't put,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

839
00:38:27.781 --> 00:38:32.640
<v Speaker 1>police chase ends in shooting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't put police chase ends and crash.</v>

840
00:38:32.670 --> 00:38:37.670
<v Speaker 1>Just put police chase and let me find,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you remember a few years back there</v>

841
00:38:38.111 --> 00:38:40.090
<v Speaker 1>was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a thing that they did on</v>

842
00:38:40.091 --> 00:38:44.470
<v Speaker 1>television where there was some sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>a situation where there was a guy who</v>

843
00:38:44.471 --> 00:38:48.370
<v Speaker 1>was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was over a bridge and he had a gun in</v>

844
00:38:48.371 --> 00:38:51.730
<v Speaker 1>his mouth and it was on television.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember that?</v>

845
00:38:52.120 --> 00:38:56.830
<v Speaker 1>And then he shot himself on TV and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>had apologized because they showed this</v>

846
00:38:56.831 --> 00:39:01.600
<v Speaker 1>guy getting shot on tv and it was like</v>
<v Speaker 1>this really shocking moment for people.</v>

847
00:39:01.870 --> 00:39:04.990
<v Speaker 1>And I was just thinking that that's not</v>
<v Speaker 1>even shocking anymore.</v>

848
00:39:05.560 --> 00:39:07.750
<v Speaker 1>Like the exact same thing today I'd be</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

849
00:39:07.850 --> 00:39:10.420
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well now they pull back.</v>

850
00:39:10.470 --> 00:39:11.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>W W when,</v>

851
00:39:11.410 --> 00:39:16.410
<v Speaker 1>when a guy gets out of a car and if it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>unclear whether you know he's giving up</v>

852
00:39:17.010 --> 00:39:17.650
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

853
00:39:17.650 --> 00:39:22.650
<v Speaker 1>the cameras from the news media will</v>
<v Speaker 1>pull back to prevent people from seeing</v>

854
00:39:22.661 --> 00:39:25.210
<v Speaker 1>something graphic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You hear him go pull back,</v>

855
00:39:25.211 --> 00:39:26.770
<v Speaker 1>pull back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pull back because I don't know if</v>

856
00:39:26.780 --> 00:39:28.510
<v Speaker 1>there's a shooting is about to take</v>
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>

857
00:39:28.930 --> 00:39:30.160
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like that part of it.</v>

858
00:39:30.161 --> 00:39:32.800
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like to see that hardcore</v>

859
00:39:32.801 --> 00:39:35.680
<v Speaker 1>violence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just like the drama of,</v>

860
00:39:36.490 --> 00:39:37.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

861
00:39:38.650 --> 00:39:41.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm always intrigued with what these</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are thinking.</v>

862
00:39:41.441 --> 00:39:43.240
<v Speaker 1>Are they thinking they're going to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>away?</v>

863
00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:47.560
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's like there's 75 cop cars</v>

864
00:39:48.190 --> 00:39:50.560
<v Speaker 1>chasing you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's helicopters overhead.</v>

865
00:39:50.561 --> 00:39:53.280
<v Speaker 1>Do you think you're going to get away</v>
<v Speaker 1>nail?</v>

866
00:39:53.400 --> 00:39:55.600
<v Speaker 1>And it fascinates me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Has Anybody ever gotten away?</v>

867
00:39:55.630 --> 00:39:57.700
<v Speaker 1>What does this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people have though?</v>

868
00:39:58.030 --> 00:39:59.890
<v Speaker 1>I'm in a high speed chase,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bro.</v>

869
00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:03.630
<v Speaker 1>A suspect broadcast on facebook live</v>
<v Speaker 1>this way,</v>

870
00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:07.270
<v Speaker 1>your suit now this is a new thing where</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they're being chased,</v>

871
00:40:07.271 --> 00:40:09.850
<v Speaker 1>they've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they video themselves.</v>

872
00:40:10.630 --> 00:40:12.150
<v Speaker 1>It's this guy's driving a truck</v>

873
00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:15.860
<v Speaker 3>two and a half hours long this week.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've seen this two fields and whatnot.</v>

874
00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:17.420
<v Speaker 3>How's he grandma?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love you.</v>

875
00:40:17.421 --> 00:40:19.160
<v Speaker 3>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how does he have enough gas?</v>

876
00:40:19.880 --> 00:40:21.670
<v Speaker 3>He stopped a few times and unloaded the</v>
<v Speaker 3>ship.</v>

877
00:40:22.230 --> 00:40:24.600
<v Speaker 1>Good move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The cops tried to get them.</v>

878
00:40:25.170 --> 00:40:27.120
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's interesting.</v>

879
00:40:27.150 --> 00:40:28.560
<v Speaker 1>He stopped and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

880
00:40:28.620 --> 00:40:31.180
<v Speaker 1>he's hanging out of the truck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but look at,</v>

881
00:40:31.181 --> 00:40:32.940
<v Speaker 1>I watch this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

882
00:40:32.941 --> 00:40:34.050
<v Speaker 1>that was the end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was,</v>

883
00:40:34.250 --> 00:40:38.130
<v Speaker 1>he was going up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was about a minute of him driving</v>

884
00:40:38.131 --> 00:40:40.350
<v Speaker 1>in reverse prior to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happened?</v>

885
00:40:40.351 --> 00:40:41.184
<v Speaker 1>They tase him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

886
00:40:42.450 --> 00:40:45.750
<v Speaker 1>And then he ended up in that little pond</v>
<v Speaker 1>or whatever and he's smoking weed.</v>

887
00:40:45.780 --> 00:40:46.800
<v Speaker 1>I love these people,</v>

888
00:40:47.380 --> 00:40:49.370
<v Speaker 3>guy and that girl with their plastic</v>
<v Speaker 3>faces.</v>

889
00:40:49.430 --> 00:40:52.280
<v Speaker 3>The show live pd that's been on on</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fridays and Saturdays?</v>

890
00:40:52.310 --> 00:40:53.780
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>

891
00:40:53.781 --> 00:40:55.340
<v Speaker 3>it goes viral.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Viral.</v>

892
00:40:55.341 --> 00:40:58.010
<v Speaker 3>Is that a weird word to use?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's trending on twitter every night</v>

893
00:40:58.011 --> 00:41:01.370
<v Speaker 3>because they're technically live with</v>
<v Speaker 3>police like this in five or six,</v>

894
00:41:01.371 --> 00:41:03.640
<v Speaker 3>seven different cities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

895
00:41:04.070 --> 00:41:06.710
<v Speaker 3>but I think Friday and Saturday nights</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they just follow what's happening.</v>

896
00:41:06.711 --> 00:41:10.310
<v Speaker 3>If someone's getting pulled over for</v>
<v Speaker 3>speeding or drugs or whatever it is.</v>

897
00:41:10.311 --> 00:41:12.350
<v Speaker 3>And they just kind of followed the whole</v>
<v Speaker 3>like cops used to be,</v>

898
00:41:12.351 --> 00:41:15.640
<v Speaker 3>but it's literally live.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's the question about like is that</v>

899
00:41:15.880 --> 00:41:18.670
<v Speaker 1>currently this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're living in a time where people</v>

900
00:41:18.700 --> 00:41:23.650
<v Speaker 1>absolutely want attention at any cost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And does this go back to that because I</v>

901
00:41:23.651 --> 00:41:26.800
<v Speaker 1>love those fucking people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those people pause that for a second.</v>

902
00:41:26.980 --> 00:41:29.650
<v Speaker 1>These fucking people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these broadcast people.</v>

903
00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:31.440
<v Speaker 1>Oh it does it make it blurs it out when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

904
00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:35.130
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those people to broadcast news people</v>

905
00:41:35.131 --> 00:41:39.680
<v Speaker 1>are so odd today cause they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like a relic of a forgotten time</v>

906
00:41:40.010 --> 00:41:43.040
<v Speaker 1>and I were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>were talking like this was acceptable</v>

907
00:41:43.550 --> 00:41:46.620
<v Speaker 1>and seems like they're dying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just nothing left of that.</v>

908
00:41:46.621 --> 00:41:49.340
<v Speaker 1>Like that won't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that won't exist in 20 years.</v>

909
00:41:49.341 --> 00:41:51.620
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not going to be like that on the</v>

910
00:41:51.621 --> 00:41:55.100
<v Speaker 1>news a because it has already like</v>
<v Speaker 1>evolved away from that with a lot of</v>

911
00:41:55.101 --> 00:41:56.240
<v Speaker 1>radio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know how that was like the</v>

912
00:41:56.241 --> 00:42:00.560
<v Speaker 1>stereotypical [inaudible] and then more</v>
<v Speaker 1>and more radio hosts.</v>

913
00:42:00.561 --> 00:42:01.790
<v Speaker 1>We're going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is hacky.</v>

914
00:42:01.790 --> 00:42:05.150
<v Speaker 1>We need to just be ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well Howard stern but it hasn't done it</v>

915
00:42:05.151 --> 00:42:05.721
<v Speaker 1>yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

916
00:42:05.721 --> 00:42:08.000
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it hasn't done it yet with</v>

917
00:42:08.001 --> 00:42:11.040
<v Speaker 1>newscasters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They still have the low book.</v>

918
00:42:11.630 --> 00:42:15.550
<v Speaker 1>Howard stern singlehandedly killed the</v>
<v Speaker 1>morning joc voice singlehandedly.</v>

919
00:42:16.190 --> 00:42:18.830
<v Speaker 1>Cause I mean it just seems so</v>
<v Speaker 1>preposterous when you would listen to</v>

920
00:42:18.831 --> 00:42:21.200
<v Speaker 1>him be himself and then you would listen</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

921
00:42:21.230 --> 00:42:23.480
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're coming up next with some crazy</v>

922
00:42:23.570 --> 00:42:25.940
<v Speaker 1>Brian Regan's in town.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What a funny guy.</v>

923
00:42:26.030 --> 00:42:31.030
<v Speaker 1>Really right back</v>
<v Speaker 1>facts,</v>

924
00:42:33.730 --> 00:42:36.890
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that these shows though,</v>

925
00:42:36.891 --> 00:42:38.450
<v Speaker 1>like this show that you were talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about Jamie,</v>

926
00:42:38.480 --> 00:42:41.720
<v Speaker 1>don't you think that they kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>encourage this kind of behavior?</v>

927
00:42:41.721 --> 00:42:45.020
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there's ever an argument that that is</v>

928
00:42:45.710 --> 00:42:48.590
<v Speaker 1>very counterproductive for our society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that's,</v>

929
00:42:48.591 --> 00:42:51.860
<v Speaker 1>that's almost like you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're asking people to submit content</v>

930
00:42:52.010 --> 00:42:54.750
<v Speaker 1>for this wacky chase show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Didn't you say that?</v>

931
00:42:54.830 --> 00:42:58.160
<v Speaker 1>Like it comes on at a specific time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so how can it actually be,</v>

932
00:42:58.340 --> 00:43:02.630
<v Speaker 1>they know people don't know that chases</v>
<v Speaker 1>are going to take place at a specific</v>

933
00:43:02.631 --> 00:43:03.920
<v Speaker 1>time on a specific day.</v>

934
00:43:03.920 --> 00:43:05.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if you made it live,</v>

935
00:43:05.360 --> 00:43:07.310
<v Speaker 1>if you made it a live show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're like,</v>

936
00:43:07.311 --> 00:43:09.200
<v Speaker 1>it's chase Friday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who's gonna run?</v>

937
00:43:09.260 --> 00:43:12.050
<v Speaker 1>Who's gonna ride somebody who's going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do it on purpose.</v>

938
00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:13.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>

939
00:43:13.371 --> 00:43:18.371
<v Speaker 1>now they are fucking selling cars that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are so much faster than any cop car.</v>

940
00:43:19.150 --> 00:43:24.150
<v Speaker 1>The corvette just released a new zr one</v>
<v Speaker 1>that has 750 plus horsepower.</v>

941
00:43:26.840 --> 00:43:31.340
<v Speaker 1>They think it's going to do an under</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven minute lap of the nurburgring in</v>

942
00:43:31.341 --> 00:43:35.300
<v Speaker 1>Germany.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is a fucking insane car that</v>

943
00:43:35.301 --> 00:43:37.520
<v Speaker 1>there's not a god damn cop car in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

944
00:43:37.610 --> 00:43:38.900
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be able to catch that</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

945
00:43:39.050 --> 00:43:42.560
<v Speaker 1>You're going to be able to go into a</v>
<v Speaker 1>corvette dealership by one of those</v>

946
00:43:42.561 --> 00:43:46.100
<v Speaker 1>things and you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will be so much more powerful than</v>

947
00:43:46.101 --> 00:43:50.570
<v Speaker 1>any cop car on the road,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's still not going to outrun a</v>

948
00:43:50.571 --> 00:43:51.140
<v Speaker 1>helicopter.</v>

949
00:43:51.140 --> 00:43:51.973
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

950
00:43:52.550 --> 00:43:53.930
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it is weird,</v>

951
00:43:53.931 --> 00:43:54.730
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

952
00:43:54.730 --> 00:43:56.570
<v Speaker 1>By one of those and they keep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the thing,</v>

953
00:43:56.571 --> 00:44:01.490
<v Speaker 1>like you know what Moore's law is when</v>
<v Speaker 1>it comes to computer processing power?</v>

954
00:44:02.060 --> 00:44:05.330
<v Speaker 1>I do not think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a law of escalation essentially</v>

955
00:44:05.331 --> 00:44:08.030
<v Speaker 1>that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every year computers are going to get</v>

956
00:44:08.090 --> 00:44:10.370
<v Speaker 1>exponentially more powerful and they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to keep,</v>

957
00:44:10.670 --> 00:44:14.000
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of like bottom now because</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really no need for them to get any</v>

958
00:44:14.001 --> 00:44:15.320
<v Speaker 1>more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like special,</v>

959
00:44:15.321 --> 00:44:18.110
<v Speaker 1>like personal use.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've gotten more powerful but not,</v>

960
00:44:18.830 --> 00:44:21.410
<v Speaker 1>not that much more powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's going to keep going.</v>

961
00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:23.030
<v Speaker 1>It's gonna keep going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's gonna keep going.</v>

962
00:44:23.031 --> 00:44:25.670
<v Speaker 1>They're going to get better and better</v>
<v Speaker 1>to force consumerism,</v>

963
00:44:25.671 --> 00:44:28.040
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Force people to purchase these things</v>

964
00:44:28.460 --> 00:44:31.350
<v Speaker 1>with cars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem is you're about</v>

965
00:44:31.351 --> 00:44:32.430
<v Speaker 1>acceleration.</v>

966
00:44:32.580 --> 00:44:35.610
<v Speaker 2>Like acceleration is one of the things</v>
<v Speaker 2>that people prize the most like zero to</v>

967
00:44:35.611 --> 00:44:39.300
<v Speaker 2>60 there's cars now that you can buy</v>
<v Speaker 2>right off the lot.</v>

968
00:44:39.420 --> 00:44:44.420
<v Speaker 2>That goes zero to 60 in two seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get no joy out of that in a car that</v>

969
00:44:46.331 --> 00:44:49.170
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't thrill me.</v>

970
00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:54.200
<v Speaker 2>Kind of a man of you to be in a car and</v>
<v Speaker 2>see how quickly I could be going fast</v>

971
00:44:54.780 --> 00:44:57.570
<v Speaker 2>and lots of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't mind it being gradual.</v>

972
00:44:57.600 --> 00:45:02.600
<v Speaker 2>I don't mind if it took me</v>
<v Speaker 2>10 minutes to get to six to 60 miles an</v>

973
00:45:03.361 --> 00:45:05.910
<v Speaker 2>hour,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as long as I could eventually get to 60</v>

974
00:45:05.940 --> 00:45:07.710
<v Speaker 2>you say that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you want to be able to merge onto</v>

975
00:45:07.711 --> 00:45:08.700
<v Speaker 2>the highway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tru,</v>

976
00:45:08.940 --> 00:45:11.010
<v Speaker 2>Tru.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to be able to function in my</v>

977
00:45:11.011 --> 00:45:13.380
<v Speaker 2>automobile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't get a rush out of a,</v>

978
00:45:13.500 --> 00:45:15.990
<v Speaker 2>oh by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did do the Nascar thing where you</v>

979
00:45:15.991 --> 00:45:17.730
<v Speaker 2>drive the cars.</v>

980
00:45:17.730 --> 00:45:18.730
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever done that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

981
00:45:19.230 --> 00:45:20.700
<v Speaker 2>I did it where?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

982
00:45:21.390 --> 00:45:24.210
<v Speaker 2>at first I was a passenger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody else drove it and then I drove</v>

983
00:45:24.211 --> 00:45:27.930
<v Speaker 2>one that was a rush.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So maybe I do like the zero to 60 thing.</v>

984
00:45:27.960 --> 00:45:29.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just haven't done it.</v>

985
00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:33.480
<v Speaker 2>That was on the track in Las Vegas at</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Las Vegas Motor speedway or whatever</v>

986
00:45:33.481 --> 00:45:35.940
<v Speaker 2>it's called.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most people who think they don't like</v>

987
00:45:35.941 --> 00:45:38.340
<v Speaker 2>fast cars had never really driven a fast</v>
<v Speaker 2>car.</v>

988
00:45:38.370 --> 00:45:40.110
<v Speaker 2>I tell you what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was pretty intense.</v>

989
00:45:40.170 --> 00:45:45.170
<v Speaker 2>I was either averaging 135 or top speed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>135.</v>

990
00:45:45.391 --> 00:45:46.480
<v Speaker 2>I forget.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They monitor it.</v>

991
00:45:46.500 --> 00:45:48.420
<v Speaker 2>You do like 10 laps or something like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

992
00:45:49.400 --> 00:45:50.730
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those,</v>

993
00:45:50.790 --> 00:45:52.670
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those stick shifts or is it a pencil?</v>

994
00:45:52.830 --> 00:45:56.280
<v Speaker 2>It's a stick shift and I hadn't driven a</v>
<v Speaker 2>stick and a while.</v>

995
00:45:56.340 --> 00:45:58.510
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was embarrassing because you,</v>

996
00:45:58.680 --> 00:46:02.970
<v Speaker 2>you do the stick to get out of the pits,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then once you get on the track,</v>

997
00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:07.740
<v Speaker 2>you're in whatever the the most is your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's that the whole time until you go</v>

998
00:46:07.741 --> 00:46:09.360
<v Speaker 2>back into the pits really.</v>

999
00:46:09.390 --> 00:46:11.610
<v Speaker 2>So it's just stick to get in and out of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the pits.</v>

1000
00:46:11.640 --> 00:46:15.090
<v Speaker 2>So how many gears is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forget if I forget three four.</v>

1001
00:46:15.150 --> 00:46:19.080
<v Speaker 2>And you take a class before and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>show you how to do it.</v>

1002
00:46:19.260 --> 00:46:23.190
<v Speaker 2>But when I was coming out to start,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just like all dolling it and the</v>

1003
00:46:23.191 --> 00:46:27.210
<v Speaker 2>guy had to run up next to me and like</v>
<v Speaker 2>come in and do the stick shift where he</v>

1004
00:46:27.211 --> 00:46:31.590
<v Speaker 2>was so embarrassing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm behind the wheel of a Nascar car and</v>

1005
00:46:31.591 --> 00:46:35.820
<v Speaker 2>there's a guy running alongside getting</v>
<v Speaker 2>it in the proper gear for me.</v>

1006
00:46:35.870 --> 00:46:37.230
<v Speaker 2>What was the last time you drove tick?</v>

1007
00:46:39.840 --> 00:46:40.810
<v Speaker 2>30 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1008
00:46:41.140 --> 00:46:45.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a datsun five 10 years ago and I</v>

1009
00:46:45.331 --> 00:46:47.160
<v Speaker 2>don't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never got used to it.</v>

1010
00:46:47.190 --> 00:46:48.001
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1011
00:46:48.001 --> 00:46:49.680
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never,</v>

1012
00:46:49.830 --> 00:46:50.431
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people say,</v>

1013
00:46:50.431 --> 00:46:51.840
<v Speaker 2>well you drive it for a while,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you get used to it.</v>

1014
00:46:51.841 --> 00:46:55.380
<v Speaker 2>I never did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to hate that [inaudible] of being</v>

1015
00:46:55.381 --> 00:46:58.200
<v Speaker 2>on a hill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

1016
00:46:58.230 --> 00:47:01.600
<v Speaker 2>And like there's a car too close behind</v>
<v Speaker 2>you and you're like,</v>

1017
00:47:01.650 --> 00:47:03.840
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1018
00:47:04.520 --> 00:47:07.770
<v Speaker 2>and so you've got to switch it into the</v>
<v Speaker 2>gear and then you know,</v>

1019
00:47:07.980 --> 00:47:11.310
<v Speaker 2>you go back like a foot and a half and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you're just Holland forward.</v>

1020
00:47:11.311 --> 00:47:13.740
<v Speaker 2>You just need a break.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just need a handle,</v>

1021
00:47:13.741 --> 00:47:16.050
<v Speaker 2>a break,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you hold onto the e brake and</v>

1022
00:47:16.051 --> 00:47:18.600
<v Speaker 2>then you slowly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gently let it go into gear and then let</v>

1023
00:47:18.601 --> 00:47:21.180
<v Speaker 2>go the break.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know that technique.</v>

1024
00:47:21.210 --> 00:47:24.000
<v Speaker 2>And he has a problem with like modern</v>
<v Speaker 2>cars that are stick shifts.</v>

1025
00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:25.860
<v Speaker 2>They have buttons for [inaudible]</v>
<v Speaker 2>breaks.</v>

1026
00:47:25.861 --> 00:47:28.640
<v Speaker 2>And you don't want that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was in my,</v>

1027
00:47:28.670 --> 00:47:31.810
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my brother was driving me one time,</v>

1028
00:47:31.811 --> 00:47:32.360
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1029
00:47:32.360 --> 00:47:37.360
<v Speaker 2>I was 15 and he was making a turn on a</v>
<v Speaker 2>dangerous intersection and the break in</v>

1030
00:47:40.391 --> 00:47:41.390
<v Speaker 2>the middle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1031
00:47:41.500 --> 00:47:43.180
<v Speaker 2>the break.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's okay.</v>

1032
00:47:43.480 --> 00:47:45.580
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh.</v>

1033
00:47:45.610 --> 00:47:49.000
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did it while he was making the turn.</v>

1034
00:47:49.270 --> 00:47:50.800
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what does this do when I pushed the</v>

1035
00:47:50.801 --> 00:47:54.520
<v Speaker 2>button and hold it up?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's the only time my brother ever</v>

1036
00:47:54.521 --> 00:47:56.950
<v Speaker 2>punched me in the arm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just goes</v>

1037
00:48:00.220 --> 00:48:02.710
<v Speaker 2>sideways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cars were coming.</v>

1038
00:48:02.711 --> 00:48:04.540
<v Speaker 2>They had to slam on their brakes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

1039
00:48:04.541 --> 00:48:08.500
<v Speaker 2>why the hell would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know what it was.</v>

1040
00:48:10.320 --> 00:48:13.900
<v Speaker 2>We'll just pull it up in the middle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1041
00:48:14.170 --> 00:48:18.330
<v Speaker 2>that's why you're a comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Impulsive buttons.</v>

1042
00:48:21.250 --> 00:48:24.010
<v Speaker 2>Push them and find out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1043
00:48:24.580 --> 00:48:25.413
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>

1044
00:48:25.590 --> 00:48:27.570
<v Speaker 1>so that engineer those into certain</v>
<v Speaker 1>cars,</v>

1045
00:48:27.571 --> 00:48:30.130
<v Speaker 1>like if he know Ken Block is</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible],</v>

1046
00:48:30.500 --> 00:48:33.450
<v Speaker 1>Ken Block is a very famous driver and</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1047
00:48:33.510 --> 00:48:38.510
<v Speaker 1>he has this Mustang called a Hoon again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is this crazy 1968,</v>

1048
00:48:39.870 --> 00:48:43.020
<v Speaker 1>I believe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mustang that has four wheel drive and</v>

1049
00:48:43.021 --> 00:48:45.150
<v Speaker 1>some fucking insane amount of</v>
<v Speaker 1>horsepower.</v>

1050
00:48:45.330 --> 00:48:49.530
<v Speaker 1>And there's these incredible videos of</v>
<v Speaker 1>him driving these things around.</v>

1051
00:48:49.560 --> 00:48:53.250
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that he does is</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he wants to go sideways,</v>

1052
00:48:53.251 --> 00:48:57.450
<v Speaker 1>he's shifting gears and he slams the e</v>
<v Speaker 1>brake as he's driving.</v>

1053
00:48:57.480 --> 00:48:58.180
<v Speaker 1>Like here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see the,</v>

1054
00:48:58.180 --> 00:49:00.630
<v Speaker 1>give us some volume on this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see that big thing.</v>

1055
00:49:00.900 --> 00:49:05.280
<v Speaker 1>He's got two things next to him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of them is a shifter and then the</v>

1056
00:49:05.281 --> 00:49:09.120
<v Speaker 1>other one is an e brake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so as he's driving,</v>

1057
00:49:09.300 --> 00:49:12.270
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know enough about his,</v>

1058
00:49:12.330 --> 00:49:14.550
<v Speaker 1>his methods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would love to talk to him one day,</v>

1059
00:49:14.610 --> 00:49:15.810
<v Speaker 1>65 Mustang.</v>

1060
00:49:16.230 --> 00:49:19.620
<v Speaker 1>It's a fucking crazy car man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's like straight road warrior.</v>

1061
00:49:20.340 --> 00:49:23.070
<v Speaker 1>And is this the Pike's peak one?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1062
00:49:23.100 --> 00:49:28.100
<v Speaker 1>I mean this guy's a fucking madman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean a real and a master of the</v>

1063
00:49:28.321 --> 00:49:32.160
<v Speaker 1>automobile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you watch him as he's driving and</v>

1064
00:49:32.161 --> 00:49:37.161
<v Speaker 1>his God damn mesmerizing because he is</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the edge the entire time of this</v>

1065
00:49:37.321 --> 00:49:39.780
<v Speaker 1>video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See that right there.</v>

1066
00:49:39.840 --> 00:49:42.030
<v Speaker 1>The one on the right hand side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's an outbreak.</v>

1067
00:49:42.630 --> 00:49:46.020
<v Speaker 1>So he's in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's shifting and then he's going to pop</v>

1068
00:49:46.021 --> 00:49:48.120
<v Speaker 1>the e brake and then he's going to shift</v>
<v Speaker 1>forward and,</v>

1069
00:49:48.121 --> 00:49:51.720
<v Speaker 1>but watch this motherfucker go see right</v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

1070
00:49:51.750 --> 00:49:54.600
<v Speaker 1>If I was sitting next to him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would hit the break right now.</v>

1071
00:49:54.650 --> 00:49:55.111
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go.</v>

1072
00:49:55.111 --> 00:49:56.640
<v Speaker 1>What does this do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1073
00:49:56.641 --> 00:49:59.130
<v Speaker 1>his I'm shifter is a different kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>shifter.</v>

1074
00:49:59.400 --> 00:50:02.100
<v Speaker 1>It's what's called a sequential manual</v>
<v Speaker 1>gearbox,</v>

1075
00:50:02.101 --> 00:50:05.280
<v Speaker 1>which means you don't have a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an h pattern where you go up,</v>

1076
00:50:05.281 --> 00:50:08.500
<v Speaker 1>down and to the right until the end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>down to the road.</v>

1077
00:50:08.550 --> 00:50:12.180
<v Speaker 1>Instead you're going up for up gear and</v>
<v Speaker 1>down for down gear.</v>

1078
00:50:12.270 --> 00:50:14.370
<v Speaker 1>So you just punch it for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but look at this shit.</v>

1079
00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:18.660
<v Speaker 1>He's like on the edge all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See how he keeps hitting the brake and</v>

1080
00:50:18.661 --> 00:50:21.720
<v Speaker 1>then going sideways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he's fucking mad,</v>

1081
00:50:21.721 --> 00:50:23.690
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a mad man.</v>

1082
00:50:24.280 --> 00:50:26.520
<v Speaker 1>Look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the control that he has with his</v>

1083
00:50:26.521 --> 00:50:28.460
<v Speaker 1>car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just insane.</v>

1084
00:50:29.080 --> 00:50:30.170
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's art.</v>

1085
00:50:30.350 --> 00:50:30.981
<v Speaker 1>Oh it isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1086
00:50:30.981 --> 00:50:33.350
<v Speaker 1>he's like an artist with his vehicle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He really is.</v>

1087
00:50:33.530 --> 00:50:33.950
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

1088
00:50:33.950 --> 00:50:38.450
<v Speaker 1>especially if you're a person like</v>
<v Speaker 1>myself who's an automobile enthusiast</v>

1089
00:50:38.451 --> 00:50:43.070
<v Speaker 1>and you get to watch this guy who's just</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the razor's edge of,</v>

1090
00:50:43.190 --> 00:50:44.690
<v Speaker 1>of control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1091
00:50:44.691 --> 00:50:46.520
<v Speaker 1>look how he's going around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's cliffs,</v>

1092
00:50:46.790 --> 00:50:49.520
<v Speaker 1>there's rocks everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fucking trees and shit.</v>

1093
00:50:49.521 --> 00:50:51.320
<v Speaker 1>Guard rails.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's sideways.</v>

1094
00:50:51.770 --> 00:50:52.510
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is,</v>

1095
00:50:52.510 --> 00:50:55.100
<v Speaker 1>and is not a long look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a two lane road.</v>

1096
00:50:56.600 --> 00:51:00.380
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the manipulation of the two things</v>

1097
00:51:00.381 --> 00:51:04.640
<v Speaker 1>of the e brake wear locks up the back</v>
<v Speaker 1>wheels and then look at it.</v>

1098
00:51:04.641 --> 00:51:06.650
<v Speaker 1>Look at how he's going in between these</v>
<v Speaker 1>cones.</v>

1099
00:51:06.651 --> 00:51:09.440
<v Speaker 1>Are these stacks of whatever the fuck</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are?</v>

1100
00:51:09.710 --> 00:51:10.880
<v Speaker 1>That'd be great leg.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If he,</v>

1101
00:51:10.881 --> 00:51:14.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ask some woman out to dinner and say,</v>

1102
00:51:14.420 --> 00:51:18.880
<v Speaker 1>I know a cozy little restaurant at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>top of this hill and then drive driver</v>

1103
00:51:18.890 --> 00:51:22.520
<v Speaker 1>like that to the top.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well you'd get timmy seatbelt on,</v>

1104
00:51:22.521 --> 00:51:24.410
<v Speaker 1>honey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd get a girl wants to fuck you</v>

1105
00:51:24.411 --> 00:51:28.100
<v Speaker 1>immediately and then you'd get a girl</v>
<v Speaker 1>who wants to have you killed.</v>

1106
00:51:28.560 --> 00:51:30.140
<v Speaker 1>He just never wants to talk to you</v>
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>

1107
00:51:30.200 --> 00:51:32.810
<v Speaker 1>And she can't wait to go home and write</v>
<v Speaker 1>a blog about what a piece of shit you</v>

1108
00:51:32.811 --> 00:51:33.644
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>

1109
00:51:36.580 --> 00:51:38.450
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I bring a woman to a restaurant at</v>

1110
00:51:38.451 --> 00:51:39.230
<v Speaker 1>the top,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

1111
00:51:39.230 --> 00:51:42.380
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this car goes from zero to 60 in</v>

1112
00:51:42.381 --> 00:51:44.390
<v Speaker 1>about 10 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1113
00:51:44.420 --> 00:51:46.850
<v Speaker 1>She's going to die in an intersection</v>
<v Speaker 1>like this.</v>

1114
00:51:46.851 --> 00:51:48.620
<v Speaker 1>Motherfucker can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he can't accelerate.</v>

1115
00:51:48.770 --> 00:51:51.510
<v Speaker 1>Look at him driving around cities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is downtown La.</v>

1116
00:51:51.530 --> 00:51:52.550
<v Speaker 1>This is London.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1117
00:51:52.551 --> 00:51:54.140
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's done in downtown la too.</v>

1118
00:51:54.141 --> 00:51:55.640
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he goes into those,</v>

1119
00:51:55.641 --> 00:51:57.230
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>under bridges and shit.</v>

1120
00:51:57.380 --> 00:51:59.600
<v Speaker 1>So they close off streets for him to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

1121
00:52:00.140 --> 00:52:04.040
<v Speaker 1>He's a madman and that car is fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>beautiful.</v>

1122
00:52:04.430 --> 00:52:07.100
<v Speaker 1>It's a crazy car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tubes get it because he widen the</v>

1123
00:52:07.101 --> 00:52:09.800
<v Speaker 1>stance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people hate it because he took</v>

1124
00:52:09.801 --> 00:52:12.350
<v Speaker 1>essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is an amazing classic car from</v>

1125
00:52:12.351 --> 00:52:15.800
<v Speaker 1>1965 and they butchered it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>changed it,</v>

1126
00:52:15.801 --> 00:52:18.620
<v Speaker 1>put a roll cage in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stiffened it up and did all this</v>

1127
00:52:18.621 --> 00:52:19.550
<v Speaker 1>different shit to it.</v>

1128
00:52:19.850 --> 00:52:23.720
<v Speaker 1>I would try it just so they would</v>
<v Speaker 1>completely empty all the streets of a</v>

1129
00:52:23.721 --> 00:52:26.330
<v Speaker 1>major city for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just so can to get where I'm going.</v>

1133
00:52:35.630 --> 00:52:40.460

<v Speaker 1>It's a 18.</v>

<v Speaker 1>The guy was showing me all the,</v>

1141
00:52:53.721 --> 00:52:57.230

<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1144
00:53:04.700 --> 00:53:08.750
<v Speaker 1>I just need the gas and the brake and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the radio.</v>

1145
00:53:08.840 --> 00:53:10.570
<v Speaker 1>You know what else does too and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>like kind of it.</v>

1146
00:53:10.620 --> 00:53:13.300
<v Speaker 1>If you're about to change lanes and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck if like someone's too close,</v>

1147
00:53:13.330 --> 00:53:16.070
<v Speaker 1>it'll give you like give you like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>vibration.</v>

00:53:16.071 --> 00:53:18.290
<v Speaker 1>I'll let you know that like there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>something on that side.</v>

1149
00:53:18.470 --> 00:53:21.550
<v Speaker 1>He said that if you don't have your</v>
<v Speaker 1>blinker on,</v>

1150
00:53:21.590 --> 00:53:24.740
<v Speaker 1>I haven't tried this yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you don't have your blinker on and</v>

1151
00:53:24.741 --> 00:53:25.980
<v Speaker 1>you to cross the line,</v>

1152
00:53:26.010 --> 00:53:30.180
<v Speaker 2>it will automatically pull you back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas if you have your blinker on,</v>

1153
00:53:30.420 --> 00:53:33.090
<v Speaker 2>then the car knows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if he was just bs thing or</v>

1154
00:53:33.091 --> 00:53:34.410
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's what he told to make a quick</v>

1155
00:53:34.411 --> 00:53:35.680
<v Speaker 2>maneuver.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I said.</v>

1156
00:53:35.690 --> 00:53:37.680
<v Speaker 2>So what if?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What if you're trying to,</v>

1157
00:53:37.740 --> 00:53:39.480
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to get over.</v>

1158
00:53:39.930 --> 00:53:41.730
<v Speaker 2>You know the card is going to take over</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1159
00:53:41.731 --> 00:53:44.010
<v Speaker 2>I think that's quite strange.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1160
00:53:44.040 --> 00:53:47.190
<v Speaker 2>I'm torn because on one hand I love</v>
<v Speaker 2>gadgets.</v>

1161
00:53:47.440 --> 00:53:49.920
<v Speaker 2>I love technology and I'm fascinated by</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1162
00:53:49.921 --> 00:53:52.650
<v Speaker 2>But another hand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the connection that you have to the</v>

1163
00:53:52.651 --> 00:53:56.040
<v Speaker 2>actual mechanical feeling of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>automobile is,</v>

1164
00:53:56.390 --> 00:53:58.440
<v Speaker 2>is very muted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Also,</v>

1165
00:53:58.441 --> 00:53:59.600
<v Speaker 2>have you heard about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1166
00:54:00.500 --> 00:54:04.620
<v Speaker 2>the technology is getting closer to</v>
<v Speaker 2>closer to self driving cars and,</v>

1167
00:54:04.650 --> 00:54:08.550
<v Speaker 2>but now there's the moral component and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>

1168
00:54:08.730 --> 00:54:12.450
<v Speaker 2>if you're not in charge of the car and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the car is about to have an accident,</v>

1169
00:54:12.750 --> 00:54:15.750
<v Speaker 2>the human being has the decision to make</v>
<v Speaker 2>a moral choice.</v>

1170
00:54:16.050 --> 00:54:16.883
<v Speaker 2>If there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1171
00:54:17.010 --> 00:54:20.850
<v Speaker 2>a woman with a baby stroller on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>right and there's a cliff on the left</v>

1172
00:54:20.851 --> 00:54:24.360
<v Speaker 2>and you have your family in the back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you making a left or a right?</v>

1173
00:54:24.690 --> 00:54:29.690
<v Speaker 2>The human can make a conscious decision.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A computerized car can't make a decision</v>

1174
00:54:31.890 --> 00:54:36.890
<v Speaker 2>and they actually are trying to figure</v>
<v Speaker 2>out how to have the cars make moral</v>

1175
00:54:37.261 --> 00:54:41.250
<v Speaker 2>decisions and keeping with your own</v>
<v Speaker 2>moral decisions.</v>

1176
00:54:41.251 --> 00:54:43.080
<v Speaker 2>You can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can gauge it and go,</v>

1177
00:54:43.081 --> 00:54:47.070
<v Speaker 2>I'm more for my family or I'm more for a</v>
<v Speaker 2>more altruistic yeah,</v>

1178
00:54:47.160 --> 00:54:47.993
<v Speaker 2>et Cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 2>et cetera.</v>

1179
00:54:48.480 --> 00:54:50.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what like what would a car do?</v>

1180
00:54:50.731 --> 00:54:51.840
<v Speaker 2>Like if it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well there's a,</v>

1181
00:54:52.140 --> 00:54:53.970
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a family,</v>

1182
00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:57.720
<v Speaker 2>there's an older guy over here and</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a young woman with a child over</v>

1183
00:54:57.721 --> 00:55:00.120
<v Speaker 2>here and you have to hit one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus.</v>

1184
00:55:01.080 --> 00:55:03.450
<v Speaker 2>How does a computer make that decision?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1185
00:55:03.510 --> 00:55:06.360
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or the decision to,</v>

1186
00:55:06.990 --> 00:55:08.400
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the cliff thing.</v>

1187
00:55:08.400 --> 00:55:11.850
<v Speaker 2>It's a good one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like does it run into the child and the</v>

1188
00:55:11.851 --> 00:55:14.610
<v Speaker 2>woman or does it go off the cliff and</v>
<v Speaker 2>kill everyone in the car?</v>

1189
00:55:14.670 --> 00:55:16.200
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or if your bike,</v>

1190
00:55:16.620 --> 00:55:19.500
<v Speaker 2>and it would be different if you're by</v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself or if you have your family.</v>

1191
00:55:19.530 --> 00:55:23.610
<v Speaker 2>Like I will say my family,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but maybe I would go myself if it were a</v>

1192
00:55:23.700 --> 00:55:24.870
<v Speaker 2>baby,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

1193
00:55:24.871 --> 00:55:27.810
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a human can make that decision in a</v>

1194
00:55:27.811 --> 00:55:29.220
<v Speaker 2>split second,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a computer,</v>

1195
00:55:29.221 --> 00:55:30.630
<v Speaker 2>what's it supposed to do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1196
00:55:30.631 --> 00:55:33.330
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that's gotten much</v>
<v Speaker 2>better that I think is amazing,</v>

1197
00:55:33.331 --> 00:55:37.230
<v Speaker 2>it's breaking like your car can brake so</v>
<v Speaker 2>much faster now.</v>

1198
00:55:37.560 --> 00:55:42.560
<v Speaker 2>They have a amazing breaks now in cars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And though as as technology gets better</v>

1199
00:55:42.751 --> 00:55:45.390
<v Speaker 2>and better in that regard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be able to prevent a lot</v>

1200
00:55:45.391 --> 00:55:48.720
<v Speaker 2>of collisions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other thing is that with car to car</v>

1201
00:55:48.721 --> 00:55:51.660
<v Speaker 2>collisions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's some talk about developing</v>

1202
00:55:51.661 --> 00:55:55.950
<v Speaker 2>technology that literally has cars repel</v>
<v Speaker 2>from each other.</v>

1203
00:55:55.960 --> 00:56:00.960
<v Speaker 2>It's sorta like how magnets do and that</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they could figure out a way to make</v>

1204
00:56:01.261 --> 00:56:05.640
<v Speaker 2>that efficient and effective enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can virtually eliminate car</v>

1205
00:56:05.641 --> 00:56:08.790
<v Speaker 2>accidents with those two things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with automated vehicles.</v>

1206
00:56:09.470 --> 00:56:11.340
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then with the,</v>

1207
00:56:11.370 --> 00:56:15.000
<v Speaker 2>the kind of technology that would force</v>
<v Speaker 2>cars to repel from each other.</v>

1208
00:56:15.730 --> 00:56:17.610
<v Speaker 2>A bunch of repelling magnets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1209
00:56:17.730 --> 00:56:20.640
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just put repelling magnets on every car.</v>

1210
00:56:20.641 --> 00:56:24.190
<v Speaker 2>So they're just the camp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can't get any closer than five</v>

1211
00:56:24.190 --> 00:56:25.780
<v Speaker 1>feet from each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then the real question is like,</v>

1212
00:56:25.781 --> 00:56:28.460
<v Speaker 1>what if you get close to a deal with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>pacemaker and you just fucking ice and</v>

1213
00:56:29.810 --> 00:56:32.230
<v Speaker 1>taking a right turn?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy just drops right there.</v>

1214
00:56:33.160 --> 00:56:35.150
<v Speaker 1>So all the cars are safe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this guy,</v>

1215
00:56:35.151 --> 00:56:38.050
<v Speaker 1>he's given a massive heart attack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing with pacemakers,</v>

1216
00:56:38.051 --> 00:56:38.950
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Magnets.</v>

1217
00:56:39.550 --> 00:56:42.520
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think magnesium really fuck up</v>

1218
00:56:42.521 --> 00:56:44.010
<v Speaker 1>pacemakers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

1219
00:56:44.210 --> 00:56:46.760
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you see that Christian Bale is going</v>

1220
00:56:46.761 --> 00:56:48.990
<v Speaker 1>to play Dick Cheney?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Speaking of Pacemakers,</v>

1221
00:56:49.310 --> 00:56:51.040
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know Dick Cheney at one point in</v>

1222
00:56:51.041 --> 00:56:54.550
<v Speaker 1>time literally is the antichrist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had no pulse.</v>

1223
00:56:54.670 --> 00:56:57.910
<v Speaker 1>He had some kind of crazy heart valve</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing where,</v>

1224
00:56:57.911 --> 00:57:00.610
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had some artificial heart in his body</v>

1225
00:57:00.790 --> 00:57:04.390
<v Speaker 1>that literally was pumping the blood</v>
<v Speaker 1>constantly with no heartbeat.</v>

1226
00:57:04.660 --> 00:57:07.210
<v Speaker 1>So he had no heartbeat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's strange.</v>

1227
00:57:07.450 --> 00:57:09.520
<v Speaker 1>It's terrifying when you think of what</v>
<v Speaker 1>an evil,</v>

1228
00:57:09.521 --> 00:57:13.600
<v Speaker 1>fuck that Guy Christian Bale looks</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost unrecognizable after putting on</v>

1229
00:57:13.601 --> 00:57:15.790
<v Speaker 1>weight and shaving head for Dick Cheney</v>
<v Speaker 1>role.</v>

1230
00:57:15.880 --> 00:57:18.010
<v Speaker 1>You know what he looks like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He looks like the guy who designs</v>

1231
00:57:18.020 --> 00:57:19.690
<v Speaker 1>iphones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know that God,</v>

1232
00:57:19.691 --> 00:57:21.460
<v Speaker 1>the Chris didn't demand who talks like</v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

1233
00:57:21.461 --> 00:57:23.800
<v Speaker 1>The amazing oled led screen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1234
00:57:24.670 --> 00:57:26.830
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Am I wrong?</v>

1235
00:57:26.950 --> 00:57:28.640
<v Speaker 1>Did you see what he lama said that he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

1236
00:57:28.690 --> 00:57:30.850
<v Speaker 1>they're making a big announcement this</v>
<v Speaker 1>week about what?</v>

1237
00:57:30.970 --> 00:57:32.830
<v Speaker 1>The semi truck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1238
00:57:32.831 --> 00:57:35.920
<v Speaker 1>the going to have an automated truck</v>
<v Speaker 1>blow your mind or pull your head clear</v>

1239
00:57:35.921 --> 00:57:37.300
<v Speaker 1>out of your skull.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>

1240
00:57:37.330 --> 00:57:40.570
<v Speaker 1>Into an alternate dimension.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just need to find my portal gun.</v>

1241
00:57:40.571 --> 00:57:41.920
<v Speaker 1>He's a weird cat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't he?</v>

1242
00:57:42.400 --> 00:57:45.970
<v Speaker 1>He's got a lot of shit going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You talk about guys do a lot of things</v>

1243
00:57:46.300 --> 00:57:49.180
<v Speaker 1>that Elon musk character,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're thinking a lot of goddamn irons in</v>

1244
00:57:49.181 --> 00:57:50.620
<v Speaker 1>the fire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't he trying to,</v>

1245
00:57:50.621 --> 00:57:53.650
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do a manned mission to Mars?</v>

1246
00:57:53.651 --> 00:57:54.460
<v Speaker 1>Is there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1247
00:57:54.460 --> 00:57:55.630
<v Speaker 1>he wants to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1248
00:57:56.320 --> 00:57:57.970
<v Speaker 1>Would you go fuck that?</v>

1249
00:57:58.600 --> 00:58:00.210
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the thing.</v>

1250
00:58:00.220 --> 00:58:04.270
<v Speaker 1>Space space is infinite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Space is infinite.</v>

1251
00:58:04.300 --> 00:58:07.060
<v Speaker 1>We are literally in the best</v>
<v Speaker 1>neighborhood in space.</v>

1252
00:58:07.480 --> 00:58:10.560
<v Speaker 1>That's the way I look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I'm looking at like getting,</v>

1253
00:58:10.900 --> 00:58:15.250
<v Speaker 1>getting to Mars is just like you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to a shitty neighborhood</v>

1254
00:58:15.370 --> 00:58:17.320
<v Speaker 1>that you can't return from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1255
00:58:17.321 --> 00:58:19.060
<v Speaker 1>hopefully you can return from it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can answer.</v>

1256
00:58:19.061 --> 00:58:21.310
<v Speaker 1>The plan is to go there and come back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not,</v>

1257
00:58:21.340 --> 00:58:22.690
<v Speaker 1>they're not bringing people there to</v>
<v Speaker 1>die.</v>

1258
00:58:22.691 --> 00:58:24.700
<v Speaker 1>There they are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're bringing people there to</v>

1259
00:58:24.701 --> 00:58:27.550
<v Speaker 1>colonize them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their initial people that go to Mars</v>

1260
00:58:27.610 --> 00:58:31.690
<v Speaker 1>until they figure out how to some way on</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mars to return to earth.</v>

1261
00:58:31.870 --> 00:58:34.600
<v Speaker 1>The people that go to Mars the first</v>
<v Speaker 1>time or just going to stay there.</v>

1262
00:58:34.630 --> 00:58:37.510
<v Speaker 1>I did not know that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought this was get there,</v>

1263
00:58:37.511 --> 00:58:39.610
<v Speaker 1>get on his craft and come.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do not believe so.</v>

1264
00:58:39.910 --> 00:58:42.550
<v Speaker 1>As of two years ago when I had a bit</v>
<v Speaker 1>about it,</v>

1265
00:58:42.880 --> 00:58:46.000
<v Speaker 1>it was all about them going there and</v>
<v Speaker 1>dying there,</v>

00:58:46.720 --> 00:58:50.650
<v Speaker 1>You're going to die on Mars and you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>die on Mars with a bunch of other people</v>

1268
00:58:50.651 --> 00:58:53.310
<v Speaker 1>that are so fucking stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're willing to die on Mars with you.</v>

1269
00:58:53.650 --> 00:58:55.180
<v Speaker 1>You're still in space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

1270
00:58:55.181 --> 00:58:57.550
<v Speaker 1>this is the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are in space right now.</v>

1271
00:58:57.820 --> 00:59:01.330
<v Speaker 1>We are just in an amazing vehicle for</v>
<v Speaker 1>space travel.</v>

1272
00:59:01.450 --> 00:59:03.940
<v Speaker 1>We're on earth and we're here at</v>
<v Speaker 1>southern Sun,</v>

1273
00:59:03.970 --> 00:59:07.930
<v Speaker 1>sunny southern California where the</v>
<v Speaker 1>weather's beautiful and you've got a</v>

1274
00:59:07.931 --> 00:59:10.930
<v Speaker 1>nice starbucks here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're sitting here in this beautiful air</v>

1275
00:59:10.931 --> 00:59:12.850
<v Speaker 1>condition studio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're in space.</v>

1276
00:59:12.970 --> 00:59:15.340
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What'd you send the best spot in space</v>

1277
00:59:15.640 --> 00:59:17.710
<v Speaker 1>to go to?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mars is just fucking dumb.</v>

1278
00:59:18.470 --> 00:59:19.930
<v Speaker 1>It's a dumb idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1279
00:59:19.931 --> 00:59:20.411
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're,</v>

1280
00:59:20.411 --> 00:59:25.130
<v Speaker 1>we're we explorers and we will always</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to know what's on the other side of</v>

1281
00:59:25.131 --> 00:59:27.520
<v Speaker 1>the mountain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I think it's like there's</v>

1282
00:59:27.530 --> 00:59:30.350
<v Speaker 1>no stopping us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's like one of those guys that</v>

1283
00:59:30.351 --> 00:59:34.160
<v Speaker 1>creates the very first wingsuit and</v>
<v Speaker 1>jumps off a cliff and then breaks both</v>

1284
00:59:34.161 --> 00:59:36.980
<v Speaker 1>of his legs versus you taking a flight</v>
<v Speaker 1>to New Zealand.</v>

1285
00:59:39.510 --> 00:59:41.600
<v Speaker 1>She had to take a fun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nice flight team.</v>

1286
00:59:42.550 --> 00:59:45.400
<v Speaker 1>You could have a lovely dinner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>catch a nap,</v>

1287
00:59:45.590 --> 00:59:48.530
<v Speaker 1>watch a movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>land perfectly.</v>

1288
00:59:48.640 --> 00:59:51.360
<v Speaker 1>If flight attendants are all great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a fucking explorer.</v>

1289
00:59:51.490 --> 00:59:54.130
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That guy's an asshole with broken legs,</v>

1290
00:59:54.140 --> 00:59:54.711
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

1291
00:59:54.711 --> 00:59:56.530
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That guy that did that,</v>

1292
00:59:56.540 --> 00:59:59.210
<v Speaker 1>this the guy that did the wingsuit off</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Mount Everest,</v>

1293
00:59:59.211 --> 01:00:02.420
<v Speaker 1>speaking of Youtube clips,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he passed away jumping off some other</v>

1294
01:00:02.421 --> 01:00:04.460
<v Speaker 1>mountain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a wonderful way to put it.</v>

1295
01:00:04.850 --> 01:00:06.180
<v Speaker 1>Then he passed away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>passed away.</v>

1296
01:00:06.530 --> 01:00:08.120
<v Speaker 1>He died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He down.</v>

<v Speaker 1>there's him right there.</v>

<v Speaker 1>folks is very good.</v>

1325

<v Speaker 1>Podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's called cleared hot with Andy Stump.</v>

1326
01:01:42.920 --> 01:01:44.240
<v Speaker 1>He's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very interesting,</v>

1327
01:01:44.241 --> 01:01:45.830
<v Speaker 1>intelligent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>articulate guy.</v>

1328
01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:47.820
<v Speaker 1>So he needs the oxygen cause he's so</v>
<v Speaker 1>hot,</v>

1329
01:01:48.110 --> 01:01:49.820
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's not just a maniac,</v>

01:01:49.821 --> 01:01:51.530
<v Speaker 1>he's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a brilliant guy,</v>

1331
01:01:51.860 --> 01:01:54.480
<v Speaker 1>but he's a fucking maniac too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1332
01:01:54.530 --> 01:01:57.560
<v Speaker 1>I haven't done anything like that man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean back in my,</v>

1333
01:01:57.680 --> 01:02:01.190
<v Speaker 1>I guess when I was competing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kickboxing and taekwondo tournaments</v>

1334
01:02:01.191 --> 01:02:03.980
<v Speaker 1>were probably the scariest thing is</v>
<v Speaker 1>being in a fight.</v>

1335
01:02:03.981 --> 01:02:05.420
<v Speaker 1>Like yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fights are scary,</v>

1336
01:02:05.540 --> 01:02:08.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially the potential to get knocked</v>

1337
01:02:08.721 --> 01:02:10.970
<v Speaker 1>unconscious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just see a lot of,</v>

1338
01:02:11.630 --> 01:02:13.910
<v Speaker 1>I mean I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen a lot of people get knocked</v>

1339
01:02:13.911 --> 01:02:18.620
<v Speaker 1>unconscious and all my days I probably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I probably seen more people get knocked</v>

1340
01:02:18.621 --> 01:02:22.020
<v Speaker 1>unconscious then 99.9% of all the people</v>
<v Speaker 1>that have ever lived.</v>

1341
01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:24.120
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's an honest statement.</v>

1342
01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:27.210
<v Speaker 1>Cause think about all the fights that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've called.</v>

1343
01:02:28.110 --> 01:02:33.060
<v Speaker 1>I've called more than a thousand UFC</v>
<v Speaker 1>fights easily more than,</v>

1344
01:02:33.120 --> 01:02:37.680
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how many hundreds of events</v>
<v Speaker 1>with 10 plus fights on each event.</v>

1345
01:02:38.430 --> 01:02:42.780
<v Speaker 1>And then on top of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been to so many tournament's</v>

1346
01:02:43.110 --> 01:02:45.870
<v Speaker 1>taekwondo tournaments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kickboxing events,</v>

1347
01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:49.920
<v Speaker 1>just like just seeing people get</v>
<v Speaker 1>smashed.</v>

1348
01:02:50.040 --> 01:02:50.873
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's,</v>

1349
01:02:50.940 --> 01:02:52.980
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've taken people to fights for the</v>

1350
01:02:52.981 --> 01:02:57.981
<v Speaker 1>first time and there's a thing that that</v>
<v Speaker 1>happens when they see like a live fight</v>

1351
01:02:58.771 --> 01:03:01.950
<v Speaker 1>for the first time with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like he see the look on their face.</v>

1352
01:03:01.951 --> 01:03:02.680
<v Speaker 1>Like they walk out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1353
01:03:02.680 --> 01:03:04.410
<v Speaker 1>they're like Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1354
01:03:04.650 --> 01:03:06.600
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a good buddy of mine,</v>

<v Speaker 2>do you want to go to the fight tonight?</v>

01:03:56.210 --> 01:04:00.020
<v Speaker 2>there was a boxing match cause I live in</v>

<v Speaker 2>boxing match.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm Google boxing matches in Las</v>

1376
01:04:03.560 --> 01:04:05.990
<v Speaker 2>Vegas and nothing came up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know what he was talking about.</v>

1377
01:04:06.260 --> 01:04:06.891
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meet me.</v>

1378
01:04:06.891 --> 01:04:07.790
<v Speaker 2>What does it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the MGM,</v>

1379
01:04:08.180 --> 01:04:09.110
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was probably the mgm,</v>

1380
01:04:09.120 --> 01:04:11.240
<v Speaker 2>because meet me at the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll call it mgm.</v>

1381
01:04:11.241 --> 01:04:13.790
<v Speaker 2>We'll get our tickets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I go meet him and he picks up the</v>

1382
01:04:13.791 --> 01:04:14.331
<v Speaker 2>tickets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

1383
01:04:14.331 --> 01:04:17.390
<v Speaker 2>let's go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought we were going into a boxing</v>

1384
01:04:17.391 --> 01:04:18.680
<v Speaker 2>match.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We go in the door.</v>

1385
01:04:18.681 --> 01:04:22.730
<v Speaker 2>That's the first time I saw the octagon</v>
<v Speaker 2>ring or whatever that is a cage.</v>

1386
01:04:22.790 --> 01:04:23.750
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1387
01:04:23.751 --> 01:04:25.820
<v Speaker 2>it's this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even know until I went in</v>

1388
01:04:25.821 --> 01:04:27.020
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

1389
01:04:27.021 --> 01:04:27.531
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1390
01:04:27.531 --> 01:04:32.180
<v Speaker 2>we had good seats close enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that was the first time watching</v>

1391
01:04:32.181 --> 01:04:33.100
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was you guys had,</v>

1392
01:04:33.410 --> 01:04:35.360
<v Speaker 2>you guys got my seats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You guys were super close.</v>

1393
01:04:35.361 --> 01:04:36.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was fantastic.</v>

1394
01:04:37.130 --> 01:04:41.150
<v Speaker 1>You could see it in a way that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something about being really</v>

1395
01:04:41.151 --> 01:04:42.020
<v Speaker 1>close.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1396
01:04:43.040 --> 01:04:45.450
<v Speaker 1>that's the way to see it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when you saw it live</v>

1397
01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:48.930
<v Speaker 2>for your very first [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you ever watched it on television a</v>

1398
01:04:48.931 --> 01:04:50.490
<v Speaker 2>little bit here and there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a big,</v>

1399
01:04:50.520 --> 01:04:52.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fighting guy.</v>

1400
01:04:52.081 --> 01:04:53.530
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1401
01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:56.910
<v Speaker 2>but live is always better in every,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every entertainment.</v>

1402
01:04:57.020 --> 01:05:00.230
<v Speaker 2>Usually it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's something great about,</v>

1403
01:05:00.231 --> 01:05:00.260
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1404
01:05:00.260 --> 01:05:04.340
<v Speaker 1>watching things on television too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you watch things on television,</v>

1405
01:05:04.341 --> 01:05:07.820
<v Speaker 1>you get the replays and you get the</v>
<v Speaker 1>commentary that explains true.</v>

1406
01:05:07.850 --> 01:05:09.980
<v Speaker 1>Like if things are going wrong or what's</v>
<v Speaker 1>happening,</v>

1407
01:05:10.550 --> 01:05:12.110
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you're in the dark.</v>

1408
01:05:12.111 --> 01:05:13.130
<v Speaker 1>If you're in the audience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

1409
01:05:13.131 --> 01:05:14.090
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why are they stop in this?</v>

1410
01:05:14.091 --> 01:05:15.830
<v Speaker 1>What's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you don't really know what's going</v>

1411
01:05:15.831 --> 01:05:16.790
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

1412
01:05:16.791 --> 01:05:18.880
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then like the other thing about</v>

1413
01:05:18.881 --> 01:05:21.790
<v Speaker 1>watching it live as you're looking</v>
<v Speaker 1>through the cage,</v>

1414
01:05:22.030 --> 01:05:25.090
<v Speaker 1>so oftentimes you catch yourself looking</v>
<v Speaker 1>up at the big screen anyway,</v>

1415
01:05:25.480 --> 01:05:28.630
<v Speaker 1>but you're still there right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a feeling that you get in that,</v>

1416
01:05:29.170 --> 01:05:30.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially now they do it with a t</v>

1417
01:05:30.551 --> 01:05:33.320
<v Speaker 1>mobile arena,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is 20 plus thousand people and</v>

1418
01:05:33.321 --> 01:05:36.070
<v Speaker 1>it's just fucking rocking and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>intense.</v>

1419
01:05:37.270 --> 01:05:39.470
<v Speaker 1>I was impressed with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's the,</v>

1420
01:05:39.471 --> 01:05:43.570
<v Speaker 1>the violence aspect of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I was impressed with the chess match</v>

1421
01:05:43.571 --> 01:05:44.560
<v Speaker 1>aspect of it.</v>

1422
01:05:45.050 --> 01:05:47.710
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's two people and it's a mind thing</v>

1423
01:05:47.711 --> 01:05:49.480
<v Speaker 1>as much as it is a physical thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1424
01:05:49.481 --> 01:05:52.150
<v Speaker 1>100%.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So watching them look at each other and</v>

1425
01:05:52.151 --> 01:05:55.420
<v Speaker 1>figuring it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a chess match,</v>

1426
01:05:55.421 --> 01:05:56.500
<v Speaker 1>if you will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for back.</v>

1427
01:05:56.590 --> 01:05:58.140
<v Speaker 1>Lack of a better analogy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't anyway,</v>

1428
01:05:58.210 --> 01:06:01.480
<v Speaker 1>so that's part of it as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I describe it as high level problem</v>

1429
01:06:01.481 --> 01:06:06.481
<v Speaker 1>solving with dire physical consequences</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause that's really what it is.</v>

1430
01:06:07.481 --> 01:06:08.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1431
01:06:08.260 --> 01:06:11.050
<v Speaker 1>I mean you have us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have this series of techniques that</v>

1432
01:06:11.051 --> 01:06:15.100
<v Speaker 1>you're allowed to execute and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to do them on a skilled</v>

1433
01:06:15.101 --> 01:06:17.920
<v Speaker 1>fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then if you mess up,</v>

1434
01:06:17.950 --> 01:06:21.280
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't have the discipline to get</v>

1435
01:06:21.281 --> 01:06:23.560
<v Speaker 1>into the cardiovascular shape that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>necessary.</v>

1436
01:06:23.770 --> 01:06:27.160
<v Speaker 1>If you're not at a camp that has the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1437
01:06:27.880 --> 01:06:32.880
<v Speaker 1>sufficient technical knowledge and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>pays enough attention to you and someone</v>

1438
01:06:33.461 --> 01:06:35.170
<v Speaker 1>who really understands how to train</v>
<v Speaker 1>fighters.</v>

1439
01:06:35.170 --> 01:06:39.670
<v Speaker 1>Like there's so many variables and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>very hard for someone to find the right,</v>

1440
01:06:39.910 --> 01:06:43.040
<v Speaker 1>like the perfect mix of those variables.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1441
01:06:43.320 --> 01:06:43.960
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1442
01:06:43.960 --> 01:06:46.180
<v Speaker 1>and then on top of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to have enthusiasm.</v>

1443
01:06:46.181 --> 01:06:49.030
<v Speaker 1>Like enthusiasm comes and goes and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>see it,</v>

1444
01:06:49.330 --> 01:06:52.210
<v Speaker 1>you see it leave fighters like there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>fighters are you see like,</v>

1445
01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:52.650
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

1446
01:06:52.650 --> 01:06:54.610
<v Speaker 1>this guy should stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's gotta stop.</v>

1447
01:06:54.880 --> 01:06:57.370
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you could do that if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't have enthusiasm.</v>

1448
01:06:57.850 --> 01:06:58.900
<v Speaker 1>You imagine go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1449
01:06:58.901 --> 01:07:00.940
<v Speaker 1>See that's where you're wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1450
01:07:00.941 --> 01:07:01.480
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

1451
01:07:01.480 --> 01:07:04.720
<v Speaker 1>it's comms guys coming at me again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't feel up.</v>

1452
01:07:04.930 --> 01:07:06.760
<v Speaker 1>I just don't feel up to defending</v>
<v Speaker 1>myself.</v>

1453
01:07:06.940 --> 01:07:08.440
<v Speaker 1>That's not what I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I mean is like,</v>

1454
01:07:08.441 --> 01:07:12.760
<v Speaker 1>there's levels of excitement when it</v>
<v Speaker 1>comes to the exchanges and you either</v>

1455
01:07:12.790 --> 01:07:14.140
<v Speaker 1>are going into it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's like,</v>

1456
01:07:14.770 --> 01:07:18.040
<v Speaker 1>this is weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should either do it because it's a</v>

1457
01:07:18.041 --> 01:07:22.150
<v Speaker 1>fun hobby and you're just trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience a very difficult thing and</v>

1458
01:07:22.151 --> 01:07:22.780
<v Speaker 1>try it out.</v>

1459
01:07:22.780 --> 01:07:25.270
<v Speaker 1>Or you should do it because you want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be the best in the world.</v>

1460
01:07:25.450 --> 01:07:28.540
<v Speaker 1>Those are the only two things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're just a guy who is going to</v>

1461
01:07:28.541 --> 01:07:30.520
<v Speaker 1>take some fights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not telling you what to do,</v>

1462
01:07:30.550 --> 01:07:32.530
<v Speaker 1>do whatever you want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in my experience,</v>

1463
01:07:32.740 --> 01:07:35.710
<v Speaker 1>those are the guys that get hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I feel like you should,</v>

1464
01:07:35.860 --> 01:07:39.310
<v Speaker 1>you should own because you'll run into</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who's trying to be the best in</v>

1465
01:07:39.311 --> 01:07:43.420
<v Speaker 1>the world and the intensity that someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>has that wants to be the best of the</v>

1466
01:07:43.421 --> 01:07:45.790
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and somebody who really might has the</v>

1467
01:07:45.791 --> 01:07:50.320
<v Speaker 1>potential to actually reach that goal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those people are fucking scary and</v>

1468
01:07:50.340 --> 01:07:52.630
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a difference between them in you</v>

1469
01:07:53.140 --> 01:07:55.910
<v Speaker 1>that it might not just be physical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's enthusiastic,</v>

1470
01:07:55.940 --> 01:07:56.450
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1471
01:07:56.450 --> 01:08:00.970
<v Speaker 1>it's enthusiasm and its focus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if your goal is to be number 500</v>

1472
01:08:01.180 --> 01:08:04.750
<v Speaker 1>you're fucked because you're gonna run a</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] 99 four 99 is going to kick</v>

1473
01:08:04.751 --> 01:08:05.410
<v Speaker 1>you in the face.</v>

1474
01:08:05.410 --> 01:08:07.210
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just make sure you have a good manager.</v>

1475
01:08:07.690 --> 01:08:11.290
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to fight anybody that's for</v>
<v Speaker 1>99 or higher.</v>

1476
01:08:11.470 --> 01:08:12.310
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

1477
01:08:12.360 --> 01:08:13.720
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could probably pull it off,</v>

1478
01:08:13.990 --> 01:08:16.550
<v Speaker 1>but even then the attitude that would</v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

1479
01:08:16.610 --> 01:08:19.030
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to fight anybody for 99 or</v>
<v Speaker 1>higher you,</v>

1480
01:08:19.100 --> 01:08:22.700
<v Speaker 1>you would like run into someone that</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though they're ranked five 12</v>

1481
01:08:22.701 --> 01:08:24.300
<v Speaker 1>there's still more enthusiastic they</v>
<v Speaker 1>want,</v>

1482
01:08:24.410 --> 01:08:29.000
<v Speaker 1>they want to get to four 99 enthusiasm</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a big part of it and there's an</v>

1483
01:08:29.001 --> 01:08:31.790
<v Speaker 1>intangible quality like you could see it</v>
<v Speaker 1>happen in fighters.</v>

1484
01:08:31.820 --> 01:08:34.790
<v Speaker 1>And for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I watch it happen,</v>

1485
01:08:34.791 --> 01:08:37.670
<v Speaker 1>it's very disconcerting because I</v>
<v Speaker 1>remember it actually happening to</v>

1486
01:08:37.671 --> 01:08:40.790
<v Speaker 1>myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I recognize it and I see it happen in</v>

1487
01:08:40.791 --> 01:08:41.511
<v Speaker 1>these guys and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1488
01:08:41.511 --> 01:08:42.710
<v Speaker 1>this guy doesn't want to do this</v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

1489
01:08:42.740 --> 01:08:45.320
<v Speaker 1>He's got to stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you got to get out of this because</v>

1490
01:08:45.321 --> 01:08:48.380
<v Speaker 1>you're just going through the motions</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're hoping it comes out well and</v>

1491
01:08:48.381 --> 01:08:51.010
<v Speaker 1>it's not going to like you have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has gotta be,</v>

1492
01:08:51.011 --> 01:08:53.870
<v Speaker 1>it's gotta be more powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a more powerful force driving you.</v>

1493
01:08:53.900 --> 01:08:56.720
<v Speaker 1>It has to be a singular pursuit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

1494
01:08:56.721 --> 01:09:00.050
<v Speaker 1>I really don't believe that you can be</v>
<v Speaker 1>an elite professional fighter while</v>

1495
01:09:00.051 --> 01:09:02.480
<v Speaker 1>doing anything else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't moonlight.</v>

1496
01:09:02.570 --> 01:09:04.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

1497
01:09:04.810 --> 01:09:07.460
<v Speaker 1>As a fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just too fucking hard.</v>

1498
01:09:07.640 --> 01:09:08.510
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can have a day,</v>

1499
01:09:08.540 --> 01:09:10.670
<v Speaker 1>some sort of a day job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the heavyweight champion.</v>

1500
01:09:10.671 --> 01:09:13.430
<v Speaker 1>The world is actually a firefighter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>steep emile chick.</v>

1501
01:09:13.460 --> 01:09:15.830
<v Speaker 1>He's actually a legit firefighter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I,</v>

1502
01:09:15.890 --> 01:09:16.970
<v Speaker 1>it makes me uncomfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>

1503
01:09:16.971 --> 01:09:20.300
<v Speaker 1>I would like him to make enough money</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he doesn't have to be a firefighter</v>

1504
01:09:20.301 --> 01:09:23.750
<v Speaker 1>or do anything else on the side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he hasn't had like the big fights</v>

1505
01:09:23.751 --> 01:09:24.980
<v Speaker 1>yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure he's made good money,</v>

1506
01:09:24.981 --> 01:09:27.350
<v Speaker 1>but he hasn't had like the big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>big fights here.</v>

1507
01:09:27.380 --> 01:09:31.100
<v Speaker 1>Are there any accountants who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure there's some that try it,</v>

1508
01:09:31.650 --> 01:09:34.520
<v Speaker 1>get into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's uh,</v>

1509
01:09:34.700 --> 01:09:35.361
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1510
01:09:35.361 --> 01:09:36.620
<v Speaker 1>obviously you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you love it,</v>

1511
01:09:36.680 --> 01:09:37.211
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1512
01:09:37.211 --> 01:09:38.870
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's something that I don't know that</v>

1513
01:09:38.871 --> 01:09:41.420
<v Speaker 1>much about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I enjoyed watching it on that</v>

1514
01:09:41.420 --> 01:09:41.600
<v Speaker 1>evening.</v>

1515
01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:42.860
<v Speaker 1>It's intense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1516
01:09:43.190 --> 01:09:45.980
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever seen a bull fighting live?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1517
01:09:46.400 --> 01:09:48.770
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't agree with bull fighting,</v>

1518
01:09:48.920 --> 01:09:52.400
<v Speaker 1>but I think I would like to see it live</v>
<v Speaker 1>just because I think it's like it's</v>

1519
01:09:52.401 --> 01:09:54.140
<v Speaker 1>going to happen whether I'm there or</v>
<v Speaker 1>not.</v>

1520
01:09:54.380 --> 01:09:55.840
<v Speaker 1>And I think there'd be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

1521
01:09:55.841 --> 01:10:00.841
<v Speaker 1>I feel like that's one of those things</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a leftover cruelty from a,</v>

1522
01:10:01.400 --> 01:10:04.250
<v Speaker 1>from a past era.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't think if someone tried to</v>

1523
01:10:04.251 --> 01:10:06.620
<v Speaker 1>introduce bull fighting today in North</v>
<v Speaker 1>America,</v>

1524
01:10:06.650 --> 01:10:07.770
<v Speaker 1>there's no fucking way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1525
01:10:07.780 --> 01:10:08.660
<v Speaker 1>of course not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1526
01:10:08.720 --> 01:10:11.750
<v Speaker 1>But it's still exists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can go watch it right now if you go,</v>

1527
01:10:11.751 --> 01:10:13.730
<v Speaker 1>I guess to Spain or some other</v>
<v Speaker 1>countries,</v>

1528
01:10:14.360 --> 01:10:14.841
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1529
01:10:14.841 --> 01:10:18.830
<v Speaker 1>it bothers me that it doesn't seem fair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fight isn't fair.</v>

1530
01:10:18.890 --> 01:10:20.480
<v Speaker 1>It's not fair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

1531
01:10:21.230 --> 01:10:24.860
<v Speaker 1>100% but every now and then the underdog</v>
<v Speaker 1>wins,</v>

1532
01:10:25.310 --> 01:10:27.530
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every now and then that guy gets a horn</v>

1533
01:10:27.531 --> 01:10:32.531
<v Speaker 1>right through the rectum area</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they've got to drive to the Las</v>

1534
01:10:33.740 --> 01:10:34.573
<v Speaker 1>Vegas Hilton.</v>

1535
01:10:35.160 --> 01:10:37.190
<v Speaker 1>There's some horrible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to talk about videos you could</v>

1536
01:10:37.191 --> 01:10:39.560
<v Speaker 1>watch online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were some horrible videos of</v>

1537
01:10:39.561 --> 01:10:42.920
<v Speaker 1>bullfighting gone wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It happens quite often,</v>

1538
01:10:43.190 --> 01:10:47.330
<v Speaker 1>often enough that there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could spend hours watching bull</v>

1539
01:10:47.331 --> 01:10:48.890
<v Speaker 1>fighters get fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1540
01:10:49.190 --> 01:10:49.830
<v Speaker 1>Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>

1541
01:10:49.830 --> 01:10:52.120
<v Speaker 1>not for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a new type of bullfighting they</v>

1542
01:10:52.130 --> 01:10:55.070
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they call ethical bullfighting where</v>

1543
01:10:55.071 --> 01:10:58.440
<v Speaker 1>they don't actually fight the bowl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they jump over the bowl as a bull</v>

1544
01:10:58.441 --> 01:11:01.430
<v Speaker 1>comes at them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a joke.</v>

1545
01:11:01.460 --> 01:11:01.761
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

1546
01:11:01.761 --> 01:11:02.301
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1547
01:11:02.301 --> 01:11:04.820
<v Speaker 1>it's not a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a bunch of guys who were like</v>

1548
01:11:04.850 --> 01:11:08.750
<v Speaker 1>acrobats and they stand in front of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>bowl and as the bull comes at them,</v>

1549
01:11:08.751 --> 01:11:10.940
<v Speaker 1>they leap through the end and they flip</v>
<v Speaker 1>over the bowl.</v>

1550
01:11:11.540 --> 01:11:14.280
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes that goes wrong to,</v>

1551
01:11:14.580 --> 01:11:17.460
<v Speaker 1>somebody sent me a video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>said you called it and uh,</v>

1552
01:11:17.461 --> 01:11:18.910
<v Speaker 1>I watched the video and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

1553
01:11:18.911 --> 01:11:22.050
<v Speaker 1>trying to flip over the bull and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>bull catches him on the way up and</v>

1554
01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:24.060
<v Speaker 1>fucking crushes him.</v>

1555
01:11:24.110 --> 01:11:28.930
<v Speaker 2>Have you seen on cspan the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bull debates with a,</v>

1556
01:11:29.180 --> 01:11:34.180
<v Speaker 2>they have two podiums and there's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the one person and then the bull is at</v>

1557
01:11:36.771 --> 01:11:40.400
<v Speaker 2>the other podium and they debate like a</v>
<v Speaker 2>controversial issue.</v>

1558
01:11:40.550 --> 01:11:42.320
<v Speaker 2>But yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why would they do that?</v>

1559
01:11:42.321 --> 01:11:47.120
<v Speaker 2>The bull debates that the humans are</v>
<v Speaker 2>always win because they have the human</v>

1560
01:11:47.121 --> 01:11:49.850
<v Speaker 2>brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Bulls are just standing there.</v>

1561
01:11:50.270 --> 01:11:52.270
<v Speaker 2>What is the bull representing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1562
01:11:52.730 --> 01:11:55.520
<v Speaker 2>they'll like say global warming and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1563
01:11:55.550 --> 01:11:58.280
<v Speaker 2>the guy will give his opinion and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>they go and how about,</v>

1564
01:11:58.760 --> 01:12:03.740
<v Speaker 2>how about you bull and it just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just stands here.</v>

1565
01:12:03.860 --> 01:12:06.650
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck are you talking to?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Haven't won one debate yet.</v>

1566
01:12:07.830 --> 01:12:09.420
<v Speaker 1>I serious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1567
01:12:09.660 --> 01:12:11.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm so confused as to where you're going</v>

1568
01:12:11.671 --> 01:12:13.700
<v Speaker 1>with this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1569
01:12:13.740 --> 01:12:16.500
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking at you while I'm doing this,</v>

1570
01:12:16.550 --> 01:12:19.710
<v Speaker 1>going this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought this was so clearly absurd.</v>

1571
01:12:21.180 --> 01:12:23.520
<v Speaker 1>It was absurd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And your weight on cspan.</v>

1572
01:12:23.580 --> 01:12:25.920
<v Speaker 1>Where's this and this day and age,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>

1573
01:12:26.490 --> 01:12:30.540
<v Speaker 1>it's not absurd enough for me to</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely assume the joking around</v>

1574
01:12:30.900 --> 01:12:32.340
<v Speaker 1>Jamie.</v>

<v Speaker 1>acrobatic with the little debates.</v>

1576
01:12:34.410 --> 01:12:37.110
<v Speaker 1>I can't find it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was looking at ethical bullfighting</v>

1577
01:12:37.111 --> 01:12:39.210
<v Speaker 1>bullfighting with no hands and it's not</v>
<v Speaker 1>coming.</v>

1578
01:12:39.211 --> 01:12:42.120
<v Speaker 1>I remember we just looked it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How we see a bull fighting with</v>

1579
01:12:42.121 --> 01:12:45.750
<v Speaker 1>acrobats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know it was going try that.</v>

<v Speaker 1>There we go.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Acrobats.</v>

1582
01:12:48.510 --> 01:12:51.240
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of bad ass cause these guys</v>
<v Speaker 1>are there.</v>

1583
01:12:51.300 --> 01:12:54.120
<v Speaker 1>It's super impressive what they can do</v>
<v Speaker 1>with their bodies anyway.</v>

1584
01:12:54.390 --> 01:12:56.700
<v Speaker 1>But then you see like a bull coming at</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

<v Speaker 1>this guy's on his knees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1605
01:13:50.251 --> 01:13:53.160
<v Speaker 1>he's a crazy asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are they going to show some bad examples</v>

1606
01:13:53.161 --> 01:13:55.110
<v Speaker 1>of this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can see a few bad examples.</v>

1607
01:13:55.410 --> 01:13:57.870
<v Speaker 1>If you really want to look at you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a cruelty person.</v>

1608
01:14:00.360 --> 01:14:04.560
<v Speaker 1>Acrobatic bullfighting goes wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to dissuade someone out there</v>

1609
01:14:04.561 --> 01:14:07.560

01:14:09.090 --> 01:14:10.650
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's definitely downsides.</v>

<v Speaker 1>No idea.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I guess it doesn't seem like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Got To be careful.</v>

1643
01:15:25.031 --> 01:15:27.670
<v Speaker 1>Danimals Brian Regan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you have pets?</v>

1644
01:15:27.880 --> 01:15:28.713
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1645
01:15:28.730 --> 01:15:32.960
<v Speaker 2>I was thinking of getting a fish,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but decided against,</v>

1646
01:15:33.070 --> 01:15:35.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that tanked company that had the,</v>

1647
01:15:35.481 --> 01:15:36.800
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the TV show.</v>

1648
01:15:37.080 --> 01:15:38.360
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're based in Las Vegas.</v>

1649
01:15:38.780 --> 01:15:41.510
<v Speaker 2>I don't think the show is on anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I had them come out and they're have</v>

1650
01:15:41.511 --> 01:15:43.580
<v Speaker 2>a wall where I wanted to have some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1651
01:15:44.270 --> 01:15:47.810
<v Speaker 2>fish and we did the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We did the structural stuff.</v>

1652
01:15:50.170 --> 01:15:52.320
<v Speaker 2>I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to feed fish every day.</v>

1653
01:15:52.900 --> 01:15:54.280
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not there every day.</v>

1654
01:15:54.281 --> 01:15:54.671
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1655
01:15:54.671 --> 01:15:57.880
<v Speaker 2>the only way I can do this is if I have</v>
<v Speaker 2>an electronic feeder or whatever,</v>

1656
01:15:57.881 --> 01:16:01.780
<v Speaker 2>and they said we can do this and it just</v>
<v Speaker 2>ended up being way too much of a a thing</v>

1657
01:16:01.781 --> 01:16:04.060
<v Speaker 2>so I'm not going to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The real issue with them is you gotta</v>

1658
01:16:04.080 --> 01:16:06.190
<v Speaker 2>clean the tank too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would not do any of that.</v>

1659
01:16:06.520 --> 01:16:09.760
<v Speaker 2>I would have people come by and then the</v>
<v Speaker 2>people or by your house all the time.</v>

1660
01:16:09.790 --> 01:16:10.620
<v Speaker 2>Exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1661
01:16:10.620 --> 01:16:14.200
<v Speaker 2>They have to come once a week and it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it's too much of a commitment.</v>

1662
01:16:14.201 --> 01:16:16.360
<v Speaker 2>It is a lot to have fish that I don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>have any,</v>

1663
01:16:16.520 --> 01:16:18.820
<v Speaker 2>you know what am I going to look at it</v>
<v Speaker 2>and just go to the aquarium?</v>

1664
01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.390
<v Speaker 2>Well since you were in Vegas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go to Mandalay Bay and that's shark.</v>

1665
01:16:21.391 --> 01:16:22.810
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Been there.</v>

1666
01:16:22.870 --> 01:16:24.280
<v Speaker 2>That sounds awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pretty cool.</v>

1667
01:16:24.650 --> 01:16:27.410
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever been at Jamie in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mandalay bay?</v>

1668
01:16:27.411 --> 01:16:28.820
<v Speaker 1>I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually didn't even see the shark</v>

1669
01:16:28.821 --> 01:16:31.130
<v Speaker 1>thing when I was there last time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking great because they have</v>

1670
01:16:31.131 --> 01:16:35.060
<v Speaker 1>this huge gigantic tank with the sharks</v>
<v Speaker 1>swimming around in it.</v>

1671
01:16:35.990 --> 01:16:38.570
<v Speaker 2>It's been a while since I've been there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think you can go underneath them</v>

1672
01:16:38.690 --> 01:16:40.970
<v Speaker 2>like they can swim above you and I might</v>
<v Speaker 2>have that wrong.</v>

1673
01:16:41.130 --> 01:16:42.840
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno if that's the case.</v>

1674
01:16:42.841 --> 01:16:45.330
<v Speaker 1>You can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some places I've definitely been Kansas.</v>

1675
01:16:45.930 --> 01:16:47.330
<v Speaker 1>Jim Shark Reef.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1676
01:16:47.490 --> 01:16:49.950
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's inquired is,</v>

1677
01:16:50.280 --> 01:16:52.290
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the amount of effort,</v>

1678
01:16:52.440 --> 01:16:55.260
<v Speaker 1>we did a fear factor in Mandalay bay and</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they,</v>

1679
01:16:55.310 --> 01:16:59.130
<v Speaker 1>they gave us this tour of how this all</v>
<v Speaker 1>works and uh,</v>

1680
01:16:59.160 --> 01:17:03.330
<v Speaker 1>the amount of resources that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>involved in running this fucking thing.</v>

1681
01:17:03.331 --> 01:17:05.520
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you fish?</v>

1682
01:17:05.760 --> 01:17:06.593
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever go fishing?</v>

1683
01:17:06.900 --> 01:17:10.520
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago one with a bunch of buddies,</v>

1684
01:17:10.521 --> 01:17:14.180
<v Speaker 2>we chartered a boat out of Miami and</v>
<v Speaker 2>went out and um,</v>

1685
01:17:15.110 --> 01:17:20.110
<v Speaker 2>we were catching nothing and then all of</v>
<v Speaker 2>a sudden we hit this school and everyone</v>

1686
01:17:20.661 --> 01:17:22.010
<v Speaker 2>was going Berserk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1687
01:17:22.011 --> 01:17:24.440
<v Speaker 2>pulling them in every 30 seconds to a</v>
<v Speaker 2>minute,</v>

1688
01:17:25.190 --> 01:17:27.680
<v Speaker 2>50,</v>
<v Speaker 2>60 fish flopping around.</v>

1689
01:17:27.681 --> 01:17:30.470
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was amazing to go from nothing.</v>

1690
01:17:31.070 --> 01:17:34.550
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's similar to to hunting where</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just sit there for most of the time</v>

1691
01:17:34.551 --> 01:17:36.470
<v Speaker 2>and then all of a sudden there's an elk</v>
<v Speaker 2>or something.</v>

1692
01:17:36.530 --> 01:17:40.220
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes it was like nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then all of a sudden everybody's</v>

1693
01:17:40.221 --> 01:17:42.650
<v Speaker 2>just on fire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was pretty intense.</v>

1694
01:17:42.770 --> 01:17:45.020
<v Speaker 2>I had that happen once in Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We went to this,</v>

1695
01:17:45.021 --> 01:17:45.860
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

1696
01:17:45.990 --> 01:17:50.990
<v Speaker 2>we went on a charter boat and they'll</v>
<v Speaker 2>take you to where I think they were.</v>

1697
01:17:51.321 --> 01:17:54.530
<v Speaker 2>Amber Jack I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's what it was.</v>

1698
01:17:54.740 --> 01:17:57.200
<v Speaker 2>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's this literally like a football</v>

1699
01:17:57.320 --> 01:18:00.860
<v Speaker 2>size,</v>
<v Speaker 2>football field sized school of these</v>

1700
01:18:00.861 --> 01:18:05.090
<v Speaker 2>fish fucking up these bait fish and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>water just frothy,</v>

1701
01:18:05.091 --> 01:18:06.280
<v Speaker 2>just crazy without it.</v>

1702
01:18:06.470 --> 01:18:11.470
<v Speaker 2>Like it was amazing and just cast into</v>
<v Speaker 2>that giant football sized field and they</v>

1703
01:18:11.931 --> 01:18:15.110
<v Speaker 2>would just smash the lure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like instantly you just pulling fish as</v>

1704
01:18:15.111 --> 01:18:18.290
<v Speaker 2>much as quick as you can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So as long as this feeding frenzy went</v>

1705
01:18:18.291 --> 01:18:19.750
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could pull fishing.</v>

1706
01:18:20.300 --> 01:18:23.450
<v Speaker 2>And so then we brought those fish back</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the hotel that we were staying at and</v>

1707
01:18:23.451 --> 01:18:26.390
<v Speaker 2>we bring it to the restaurant and they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have like this whole thing that</v>

1708
01:18:26.391 --> 01:18:28.880
<v Speaker 2>they do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You talked to the chef and the chef</v>

1709
01:18:28.881 --> 01:18:30.770
<v Speaker 2>says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how would you like you prepared w we can</v>

1710
01:18:30.771 --> 01:18:32.930
<v Speaker 2>make some severe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can bake some fish,</v>

1711
01:18:33.080 --> 01:18:35.630
<v Speaker 2>we can cook it in a variety of different</v>
<v Speaker 2>preparations for you.</v>

1712
01:18:35.860 --> 01:18:38.030
<v Speaker 2>And so they did that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you're eating fish that's like</v>

1713
01:18:38.300 --> 01:18:39.900
<v Speaker 2>three hours old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>four hours old.</v>

1714
01:18:39.901 --> 01:18:41.810
<v Speaker 2>So we had it for lunch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was incredible.</v>

1715
01:18:42.020 --> 01:18:45.680
<v Speaker 2>So good co there's a comedian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jim Collin could friend of mine,</v>

1716
01:18:45.710 --> 01:18:48.410
<v Speaker 2>he said he was out with buddies of his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it's part of his act and</v>

1717
01:18:48.411 --> 01:18:52.490
<v Speaker 2>if I'm giving him complete credit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but all of his buddies were on a charter</v>

1718
01:18:53.120 --> 01:18:55.490
<v Speaker 2>charter boat and they all caught fish</v>
<v Speaker 2>except for one guy.</v>

1719
01:18:56.150 --> 01:18:59.480
<v Speaker 2>So one of the guys that worked at one of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the attendance or whatever set,</v>

1720
01:18:59.481 --> 01:19:02.450
<v Speaker 2>I'll take care of this and went to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>other side of the boat with a snorkel</v>

1721
01:19:03.500 --> 01:19:07.820
<v Speaker 2>and jumped on the opposite side of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>boat and swim and grabbed the dead fish</v>

1722
01:19:07.850 --> 01:19:12.680
<v Speaker 2>that had already been caught when</v>
<v Speaker 2>underneath hooked the dead fish to this</v>

1723
01:19:12.681 --> 01:19:16.100
<v Speaker 2>guy's line and started shaking it like</v>
<v Speaker 2>underneath the boat.</v>

1724
01:19:16.130 --> 01:19:18.300
<v Speaker 2>Oh Geez.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To make it look like it was catchy.</v>

1725
01:19:19.480 --> 01:19:23.220
<v Speaker 2>And the guy like I got one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got one and they pulled it up and um,</v>

1726
01:19:23.390 --> 01:19:25.310
<v Speaker 2>they just grabbed it really quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just through it.</v>

1727
01:19:25.311 --> 01:19:27.560
<v Speaker 2>So he couldn't see that it had already</v>
<v Speaker 2>been caught and dead.</v>

1728
01:19:27.740 --> 01:19:29.810
<v Speaker 2>And to this day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that guy thought that he caught a fish.</v>

1729
01:19:30.290 --> 01:19:31.290
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1730
01:19:31.291 --> 01:19:31.881
<v Speaker 2>And Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1731
01:19:31.881 --> 01:19:34.100
<v Speaker 2>they faked it on him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1732
01:19:34.101 --> 01:19:37.870
<v Speaker 2>That's elaborate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It must be something that they,</v>

1733
01:19:37.970 --> 01:19:39.650
<v Speaker 2>for the guide already know this</v>
<v Speaker 2>technique.</v>

1734
01:19:39.651 --> 01:19:42.440
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that's a thing where they make you</v>

1735
01:19:42.441 --> 01:19:44.600
<v Speaker 2>pretend like you're catching fish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How drunk was he?</v>

1736
01:19:44.730 --> 01:19:46.250
<v Speaker 2>A while.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would factor in,</v>

1737
01:19:46.400 --> 01:19:48.920
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure a bunch of guys on a boat</v>
<v Speaker 2>fishing.</v>

1738
01:19:49.940 --> 01:19:51.380
<v Speaker 2>Of course they're drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1739
01:19:52.040 --> 01:19:53.000
<v Speaker 2>Anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1740
01:19:53.001 --> 01:19:56.510
<v Speaker 2>Boat fishing drunk is okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hunting drunk.</v>

1741
01:19:56.930 --> 01:19:57.950
<v Speaker 2>Not Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not Okay.</v>

1742
01:19:58.160 --> 01:20:01.010
<v Speaker 2>Two very different pursuits,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would imagine.</v>

1743
01:20:01.160 --> 01:20:02.630
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But even fishing drunk yet to be</v>

1744
01:20:02.631 --> 01:20:04.580
<v Speaker 2>careful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get hooked in the ass with a hook</v>

1745
01:20:04.610 --> 01:20:08.070
<v Speaker 2>and the face catch you in the head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've people get their ears</v>

1746
01:20:08.070 --> 01:20:10.020
<v Speaker 1>hooked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1747
01:20:10.650 --> 01:20:13.190
<v Speaker 1>Someone's gonna cast and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hook just catches you as you.</v>

1748
01:20:13.330 --> 01:20:15.350
<v Speaker 2>Hi,</v>

<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1766
01:20:53.980 --> 01:20:55.470
<v Speaker 2>this is what I,</v>

<v Speaker 2>And how do you write,</v>

01:20:57.750 --> 01:20:58.583
<v Speaker 2>do you write</v>

1769

<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>perform in local spots in Vegas?</v>

1770
01:21:03.100 --> 01:21:04.870
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do it in my shows.</v>

1771
01:21:05.320 --> 01:21:07.390
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just come up with something and try to</v>

1772
01:21:07.391 --> 01:21:09.610
<v Speaker 2>book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>end it and squeeze it in there.</v>

1773
01:21:09.700 --> 01:21:12.730
<v Speaker 2>So he squeezed it in there between</v>
<v Speaker 2>already established bits and then you</v>

1774
01:21:12.731 --> 01:21:14.380
<v Speaker 2>let it grow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sordo yeah.</v>

1775
01:21:14.650 --> 01:21:15.483
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1776
01:21:15.580 --> 01:21:17.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what my batting averages</v>

1777
01:21:17.860 --> 01:21:19.690
<v Speaker 2>maybe average,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1778
01:21:19.720 --> 01:21:21.670
<v Speaker 2>in terms of new bits,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

1779
01:21:21.700 --> 01:21:22.211
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1780
01:21:22.211 --> 01:21:23.590
<v Speaker 2>some stuff just gets nothing.</v>

1781
01:21:23.880 --> 01:21:25.560
<v Speaker 1>It's always going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1782
01:21:25.561 --> 01:21:29.160
<v Speaker 1>There's the batting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's something that people that don't,</v>

1783
01:21:29.700 --> 01:21:32.250
<v Speaker 1>they've never tried comedy really</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably don't understand,</v>

1784
01:21:32.280 --> 01:21:35.250
<v Speaker 1>is that most of our stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the reasons why plagiarism</v>

1785
01:21:35.251 --> 01:21:38.780
<v Speaker 1>is so awful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's because by the time a bit become</v>

1786
01:21:38.781 --> 01:21:42.180
<v Speaker 1>something that actually works,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the amount of effort that goes into it</v>

1787
01:21:42.181 --> 01:21:44.560
<v Speaker 1>to get it to work like your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your Steve,</v>

1788
01:21:44.570 --> 01:21:47.820
<v Speaker 1>you're not just stealing this idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're stealing this gigantic process</v>

1789
01:21:47.821 --> 01:21:49.050
<v Speaker 1>that created this idea.</v>

1790
01:21:49.130 --> 01:21:49.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1791
01:21:49.730 --> 01:21:53.510
<v Speaker 2>It's definitely frowned upon in any</v>
<v Speaker 2>field,</v>

1792
01:21:53.511 --> 01:21:55.210
<v Speaker 2>but us being comedians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1793
01:21:55.220 --> 01:21:58.100
<v Speaker 2>it's particularly a egregious,</v>

1794
01:21:58.170 --> 01:21:59.640
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's also agregious because there's no</v>

1795
01:21:59.641 --> 01:22:01.280
<v Speaker 1>recourse unlike,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1796
01:22:01.410 --> 01:22:02.910
<v Speaker 1>as sort of as now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1797
01:22:02.911 --> 01:22:06.390
<v Speaker 1>you can make youtube videos and get</v>
<v Speaker 1>people angry at the person.</v>

1798
01:22:06.420 --> 01:22:08.410
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you in the,</v>

1799
01:22:08.760 --> 01:22:12.240
<v Speaker 1>like if you have music or literature or</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything,</v>

1800
01:22:12.241 --> 01:22:14.340
<v Speaker 1>a movies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very clear.</v>

1801
01:22:14.700 --> 01:22:17.520
<v Speaker 1>Like when someone plagiarizes and people</v>
<v Speaker 1>get fucked music,</v>

1802
01:22:17.521 --> 01:22:18.810
<v Speaker 1>it's a giant issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously.</v>

1803
01:22:18.811 --> 01:22:21.420
<v Speaker 1>There's been massive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>massive lawsuits from people just</v>

1804
01:22:21.421 --> 01:22:22.890
<v Speaker 1>stealing rifts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1805
01:22:22.920 --> 01:22:25.140
<v Speaker 1>With completely different lyrics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1806
01:22:25.141 --> 01:22:30.141
<v Speaker 1>they've sued for the entire value of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>song just for using samples and using</v>

1807
01:22:31.081 --> 01:22:32.100
<v Speaker 1>pieces of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1808
01:22:32.101 --> 01:22:35.610
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of songs that were</v>
<v Speaker 1>gigantic hit songs that the people who</v>

1809
01:22:35.611 --> 01:22:38.370
<v Speaker 1>wrote the songs want to making no money</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they were,</v>

1810
01:22:38.371 --> 01:22:41.700
<v Speaker 1>it was deemed that they had stolen</v>
<v Speaker 1>chunks or parts of that song from</v>

1811
01:22:41.701 --> 01:22:42.534
<v Speaker 1>somebody else.</v>

1812
01:22:42.910 --> 01:22:47.910
<v Speaker 2>I liked the fact that they can go after</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody legally,</v>

1813
01:22:48.070 --> 01:22:51.040
<v Speaker 2>but what if you're wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't like the Beatles.</v>

1814
01:22:52.240 --> 01:22:56.350
<v Speaker 2>The Beatles are one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the Beatles lost a court case</v>

1815
01:22:56.920 --> 01:22:59.590
<v Speaker 2>about having stolen a song.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

1816
01:22:59.770 --> 01:23:03.390
<v Speaker 2>And I don't remember what the song was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

1817
01:23:03.391 --> 01:23:08.391
<v Speaker 2>and you can play two songs to each other</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a jury or whoever's deciding can</v>

1818
01:23:09.161 --> 01:23:09.941
<v Speaker 2>just say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well yeah,</v>

1819
01:23:09.941 --> 01:23:12.490
<v Speaker 2>that's so close.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was obviously taken when maybe it</v>

1820
01:23:12.491 --> 01:23:14.200
<v Speaker 2>wasn't right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1821
01:23:14.410 --> 01:23:17.020
<v Speaker 2>Maybe two people thought of the same</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

1822
01:23:17.500 --> 01:23:19.750
<v Speaker 2>Definitely happens in comedy as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

1823
01:23:19.900 --> 01:23:21.190
<v Speaker 2>definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For sure.</v>

1824
01:23:21.310 --> 01:23:22.290
<v Speaker 2>I've had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1825
01:23:23.240 --> 01:23:25.090
<v Speaker 2>I had a situation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you remember Dennis Wolfsburg?</v>

1826
01:23:25.120 --> 01:23:27.910
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dennis Wolfsburg used to have a bit</v>

1827
01:23:28.120 --> 01:23:29.240
<v Speaker 2>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dennis Wolfsburg,</v>

1828
01:23:29.260 --> 01:23:30.340
<v Speaker 2>wonderful comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's no,</v>

1829
01:23:30.370 --> 01:23:31.890
<v Speaker 2>he's no longer with us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1830
01:23:32.560 --> 01:23:36.880
<v Speaker 2>and he had a thing about how the terms</v>
<v Speaker 2>imbecile idiot moron are actual</v>

1831
01:23:37.030 --> 01:23:39.010
<v Speaker 2>technical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>scientific,</v>

1832
01:23:39.330 --> 01:23:42.970
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>levels of intelligence and a,</v>

1833
01:23:42.971 --> 01:23:44.650
<v Speaker 2>there hired,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a hierarchy to them.</v>

1834
01:23:45.250 --> 01:23:50.250
<v Speaker 2>And so you could call somebody an</v>
<v Speaker 2>imbecile and it's a compliment because,</v>

1835
01:23:51.490 --> 01:23:51.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

1836
01:23:51.940 --> 01:23:53.890
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a dumber level or whatever,</v>

1837
01:23:53.950 --> 01:23:55.510
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he used to do this whole bit about</v>

1838
01:23:55.511 --> 01:23:59.500
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I went out and I started at the</v>

1839
01:23:59.500 --> 01:24:02.580
<v Speaker 2>Comic Strip in Fort Lauderdale,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then I went out on the road and I,</v>

1840
01:24:02.940 --> 01:24:05.440
<v Speaker 2>I thought I had thought of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

1841
01:24:05.500 --> 01:24:07.450
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I was doing a similar bit,</v>

1842
01:24:08.530 --> 01:24:12.400
<v Speaker 2>and I'm not for not that long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I had a comedian come up to me,</v>

1843
01:24:12.401 --> 01:24:17.401
<v Speaker 2>and I'm glad that our comedy community</v>
<v Speaker 2>is so tight that this other guy sensed,</v>

1844
01:24:19.120 --> 01:24:21.030
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just want you to know Dennis Wolfsburg</v>

1845
01:24:21.040 --> 01:24:23.170
<v Speaker 2>has a very similar bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

1846
01:24:23.171 --> 01:24:24.730
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you know that or not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>

1847
01:24:24.731 --> 01:24:28.750
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I now remember him doing the bit,</v>

1848
01:24:29.070 --> 01:24:32.950
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I now remember it and I think that I,</v>

1849
01:24:33.220 --> 01:24:37.600
<v Speaker 2>I thought I thought of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but probably the original inspiration</v>

1850
01:24:37.601 --> 01:24:39.060
<v Speaker 2>was seeing him do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1851
01:24:39.350 --> 01:24:40.500
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I dropped,</v>

1852
01:24:40.540 --> 01:24:42.520
<v Speaker 2>I dropped it like a dime.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I was like,</v>

1853
01:24:42.521 --> 01:24:44.560
<v Speaker 2>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm never doing it again.</v>

1854
01:24:44.980 --> 01:24:46.520
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there,</v>

1855
01:24:46.530 --> 01:24:49.950
<v Speaker 2>there are instances where you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure there are outright themes,</v>

1856
01:24:49.960 --> 01:24:53.500
<v Speaker 2>we all know about that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can also mistakenly come up with</v>

1857
01:24:53.501 --> 01:24:55.720
<v Speaker 2>something that you think you thought of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it,</v>

1858
01:24:55.721 --> 01:24:59.650
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to really guard against guard</v>

1859
01:24:59.651 --> 01:25:00.670
<v Speaker 2>against that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a really,</v>

1860
01:25:00.671 --> 01:25:00.780
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1861
01:25:00.780 --> 01:25:01.920
<v Speaker 1>Tricky thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1862
01:25:01.921 --> 01:25:03.240
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's very honest of you,</v>

1863
01:25:03.270 --> 01:25:05.280
<v Speaker 1>but that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that is the case with a lot of</v>

1864
01:25:05.281 --> 01:25:06.021
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we're,</v>

1865
01:25:06.021 --> 01:25:09.690
<v Speaker 1>we're very often inspired by other</v>
<v Speaker 1>people's work,</v>

1866
01:25:09.930 --> 01:25:14.850
<v Speaker 1>whether we recognize it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we recognize it or not.</v>

1867
01:25:14.940 --> 01:25:17.700
<v Speaker 1>That's the George Harrison,</v>
<v Speaker 1>George Harrison versus fonts.</v>

1868
01:25:18.120 --> 01:25:19.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1869
01:25:19.260 --> 01:25:20.093
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1870
01:25:20.610 --> 01:25:23.670
<v Speaker 1>I mean everybody's influenced in some</v>
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>

1871
01:25:23.671 --> 01:25:27.270
<v Speaker 1>shape or form by other people's work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's just no getting around it.</v>

1872
01:25:27.540 --> 01:25:31.290
<v Speaker 1>It's just a matter of whether or not</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you made a conscious decision to</v>

1873
01:25:31.291 --> 01:25:36.240
<v Speaker 1>copy someone versus whether or not you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have been somehow or another</v>

1874
01:25:36.270 --> 01:25:38.100
<v Speaker 1>influenced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in your case,</v>

1875
01:25:38.640 --> 01:25:40.710
<v Speaker 1>it's just a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a forgetting thing.</v>

1876
01:25:40.770 --> 01:25:41.401
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

1877
01:25:41.401 --> 01:25:43.650
<v Speaker 1>that that also happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could just make a mistake,</v>

1878
01:25:43.710 --> 01:25:44.910
<v Speaker 1>you can just forget.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1879
01:25:45.190 --> 01:25:46.290
<v Speaker 2>But I think the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1880
01:25:46.900 --> 01:25:48.890
<v Speaker 2>then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you have to make the decision where</v>

1881
01:25:48.891 --> 01:25:49.391
<v Speaker 2>you go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

1882
01:25:49.391 --> 01:25:50.920
<v Speaker 2>now that it's been brought to my</v>
<v Speaker 2>attention,</v>

1883
01:25:50.921 --> 01:25:53.380
<v Speaker 2>what am I going to do about this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'd like to think I made the right</v>

1884
01:25:53.381 --> 01:25:55.340
<v Speaker 2>decision once it was brought to mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to my attention.</v>

1885
01:25:55.730 --> 01:25:56.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1886
01:25:56.810 --> 01:25:59.390
<v Speaker 1>Well did you definitely did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You definitely made the right decision.</v>

1887
01:25:59.420 --> 01:26:00.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1888
01:26:00.261 --> 01:26:02.420
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you write like on a computer,</v>

1889
01:26:02.421 --> 01:26:03.254
<v Speaker 1>like how do you</v>

1890
01:26:04.430 --> 01:26:07.550
<v Speaker 2>just Nah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think of something,</v>

1891
01:26:07.551 --> 01:26:09.230
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how that happens is I don't</v>

1892
01:26:09.231 --> 01:26:11.420
<v Speaker 2>know how people think of things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how I think of things.</v>

1893
01:26:11.421 --> 01:26:14.780
<v Speaker 2>And then once I have it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I apply a little bit of a,</v>

1894
01:26:15.050 --> 01:26:17.120
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how am I going to put this to have a</v>

1895
01:26:17.121 --> 01:26:18.200
<v Speaker 2>beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>middle and an end?</v>

1896
01:26:19.670 --> 01:26:24.670
<v Speaker 2>Say it out loud a few times to try it on</v>
<v Speaker 2>stage tape and then listen and then</v>

1897
01:26:24.981 --> 01:26:25.814
<v Speaker 2>sometimes,</v>

1898
01:26:27.330 --> 01:26:27.650
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

1899
01:26:27.650 --> 01:26:30.980
<v Speaker 2>I always feel sometimes some of the best</v>
<v Speaker 2>writing takes place on stage.</v>

1900
01:26:31.880 --> 01:26:35.720
<v Speaker 2>Like I think you can have something to</v>
<v Speaker 2>qt and clever like if you write it out,</v>

1901
01:26:36.290 --> 01:26:39.260
<v Speaker 2>but when you're on stage there's a piece</v>
<v Speaker 2>of you that goes,</v>

1902
01:26:40.070 --> 01:26:44.510
<v Speaker 2>take this and say this a hundred percent</v>
<v Speaker 2>a hundred percent I completely agree.</v>

1903
01:26:44.511 --> 01:26:49.511
<v Speaker 2>This is way too wordy and when when</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're on a legal pad or a computer,</v>

1904
01:26:50.690 --> 01:26:53.270
<v Speaker 2>you throw a lot of adjectives and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>get,</v>

1905
01:26:53.840 --> 01:26:57.830
<v Speaker 2>I think you can get to conceptual where</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like when you're on stage,</v>

1906
01:26:57.980 --> 01:27:01.400
<v Speaker 2>something takes over and says tighten</v>
<v Speaker 2>this right now.</v>

1907
01:27:01.700 --> 01:27:03.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you get right to the quick.</v>

1908
01:27:04.040 --> 01:27:04.721
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>

1909
01:27:04.721 --> 01:27:06.040
<v Speaker 2>It's weird art form.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I was,</v>

1910
01:27:06.060 --> 01:27:09.110
<v Speaker 2>I was talking to a friend of mine who's</v>
<v Speaker 2>a musician about this and I was saying</v>

1911
01:27:09.111 --> 01:27:12.530
<v Speaker 2>the difference is like you can come up</v>
<v Speaker 2>with an amazing album in the studio and</v>

1912
01:27:12.531 --> 01:27:16.880
<v Speaker 2>you can tweak it and go over things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we kind of have to do it in front of</v>

1913
01:27:16.881 --> 01:27:17.760
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1914
01:27:18.290 --> 01:27:20.300
<v Speaker 2>Like to create like I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1915
01:27:20.780 --> 01:27:24.560
<v Speaker 2>But what I write down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like what you were saying is a lot</v>

1916
01:27:24.561 --> 01:27:28.310
<v Speaker 2>of times very different than how you say</v>
<v Speaker 2>it in front of people because once you</v>

1917
01:27:28.311 --> 01:27:29.930
<v Speaker 2>start doing it in front of a live</v>
<v Speaker 2>audience,</v>

1918
01:27:29.931 --> 01:27:32.600
<v Speaker 2>he just started immediately trimming it</v>
<v Speaker 2>and moving things around on it.</v>

1919
01:27:32.601 --> 01:27:34.280
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it would be interesting if</v>

1920
01:27:34.281 --> 01:27:37.700
<v Speaker 2>somebody tried to create a comedy hour.</v>

1921
01:27:38.770 --> 01:27:39.220
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1922
01:27:39.220 --> 01:27:42.790
<v Speaker 2>But without ever trying it in front of</v>
<v Speaker 2>an audience,</v>

1923
01:27:42.820 --> 01:27:46.750
<v Speaker 2>just like create the hour the best you</v>
<v Speaker 2>can just on the computer or whatever</v>

1924
01:27:46.751 --> 01:27:50.500
<v Speaker 2>going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a good hour of comedy.</v>

1925
01:27:50.980 --> 01:27:54.670
<v Speaker 2>And then the first time you ever do it</v>
<v Speaker 2>is in front of an audience as the hour.</v>

1926
01:27:55.270 --> 01:27:57.340
<v Speaker 2>I just want to know how much of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>disaster that would be.</v>

1927
01:27:57.370 --> 01:27:58.780
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Carlin used to do that.</v>

1928
01:27:59.800 --> 01:28:03.880
<v Speaker 2>That's what Carlin used to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He used to write out his whole special,</v>

1929
01:28:04.090 --> 01:28:08.440
<v Speaker 2>like he used to write a new special</v>
<v Speaker 2>every year and he would write it and</v>

1930
01:28:08.441 --> 01:28:09.860
<v Speaker 2>then he would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had two,</v>

1931
01:28:09.861 --> 01:28:12.580
<v Speaker 2>two different ways of writing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He would write it sober and they would</v>

1932
01:28:12.581 --> 01:28:17.581
<v Speaker 2>smoke pot and then punch it up and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would go and bring it to the stage.</v>

1933
01:28:18.790 --> 01:28:21.400
<v Speaker 2>And essentially it was like almost like</v>
<v Speaker 2>a one man show.</v>

1934
01:28:23.240 --> 01:28:24.830
<v Speaker 2>So you're saying he would create the</v>
<v Speaker 2>hour,</v>

1935
01:28:24.860 --> 01:28:27.050
<v Speaker 2>try it on stage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then I'm sure he would tweak it</v>

1936
01:28:27.051 --> 01:28:29.390
<v Speaker 2>before he was going to make an hbo</v>
<v Speaker 2>special or something like that.</v>

1937
01:28:29.420 --> 01:28:31.310
<v Speaker 2>Like I wouldn't do that wasn't the</v>
<v Speaker 2>finished product,</v>

1938
01:28:31.311 --> 01:28:32.660
<v Speaker 2>I think as T.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1939
01:28:32.870 --> 01:28:35.240
<v Speaker 2>I see what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I think as time went on,</v>

1940
01:28:35.270 --> 01:28:37.520
<v Speaker 2>the bits would get better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He would tighten them up,</v>

1941
01:28:37.521 --> 01:28:41.870
<v Speaker 2>but he essentially never worked as</v>
<v Speaker 2>material out and he would abandon all of</v>

1942
01:28:41.871 --> 01:28:43.690
<v Speaker 2>it every year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1943
01:28:43.850 --> 01:28:45.290
<v Speaker 2>he's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was amazing.</v>

1944
01:28:45.320 --> 01:28:46.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

1945
01:28:46.110 --> 01:28:47.870
<v Speaker 2>that's a crazy way to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1946
01:28:49.100 --> 01:28:50.660
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hear stories like that and I like,</v>

1947
01:28:50.661 --> 01:28:51.030
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1948
01:28:51.030 --> 01:28:53.000
<v Speaker 2>I like to think I'm adequate at what I</v>
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>

1949
01:28:53.001 --> 01:28:54.440
<v Speaker 2>And then you hear something like that</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you go,</v>

1950
01:28:55.400 --> 01:28:57.130
<v Speaker 2>if you put a bar graph of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1951
01:28:57.230 --> 01:28:58.600
<v Speaker 2>people talented.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so yeah,</v>

1952
01:28:59.870 --> 01:29:00.830
<v Speaker 2>I'd be like a blip.</v>

1953
01:29:00.890 --> 01:29:02.310
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>George Carlin up here.</v>

1954
01:29:02.460 --> 01:29:05.400
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was an intensely creative guy.</v>

1955
01:29:05.430 --> 01:29:10.430
<v Speaker 2>Like he didn't have to do a whole new</v>
<v Speaker 2>hour every year and do a whole new HBO</v>

1956
01:29:10.861 --> 01:29:13.680
<v Speaker 2>special every year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that was his schedule.</v>

1957
01:29:13.681 --> 01:29:17.100
<v Speaker 2>And I think the rigidity of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the discipline of that is one of</v>

1958
01:29:17.101 --> 01:29:19.860
<v Speaker 2>the things that kept him so creative and</v>
<v Speaker 2>so focused.</v>

1959
01:29:19.890 --> 01:29:21.240
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1960
01:29:23.190 --> 01:29:24.330
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was a genius.</v>

1961
01:29:24.331 --> 01:29:26.680
<v Speaker 2>I almost saw his last show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dan,</v>

1962
01:29:27.210 --> 01:29:30.240
<v Speaker 2>or one of his last shows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was performing in Las Vegas.</v>

1963
01:29:30.630 --> 01:29:34.440
<v Speaker 2>I was married at the time and my ex and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I were trying to figure out something to</v>

1964
01:29:34.441 --> 01:29:36.300
<v Speaker 2>do that evening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said George Carlin's in town,</v>

1965
01:29:38.310 --> 01:29:40.770
<v Speaker 2>and there was also a Neil diamond</v>
<v Speaker 2>impersonator.</v>

1966
01:29:42.210 --> 01:29:45.260
<v Speaker 2>So we saw,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we saw the neil diamond in person.</v>

1967
01:29:45.440 --> 01:29:47.590
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

1968
01:29:47.830 --> 01:29:51.460
<v Speaker 2>So my story isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to see one of George Carlin's last</v>

1969
01:29:51.461 --> 01:29:56.461
<v Speaker 2>sense as a human being.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get to say I saw a wonderful meal time</v>

1970
01:29:57.580 --> 01:30:02.470
<v Speaker 2>impersonator.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Christ Jesus Christ.</v>

1971
01:30:02.480 --> 01:30:04.750
<v Speaker 2>Is it good?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a good Neil diamond impersonator.</v>

1972
01:30:04.751 --> 01:30:07.510
<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1973
01:30:08.570 --> 01:30:10.150
<v Speaker 2>it was like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like really?</v>

1974
01:30:10.600 --> 01:30:13.810
<v Speaker 2>I was really happy to be there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Vegas is one of the few places where you</v>

1975
01:30:13.811 --> 01:30:18.811
<v Speaker 2>can see a lot of impersonators there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was one hotel and I saw in Las</v>

1976
01:30:19.210 --> 01:30:23.320
<v Speaker 2>Vegas and I saw the signs for all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>shows and I realized everybody was a</v>

1977
01:30:23.321 --> 01:30:26.710
<v Speaker 2>fake something else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was like the rat pack and there</v>

1978
01:30:26.711 --> 01:30:30.140
<v Speaker 2>was like a Neil diamond impersonator and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it was the guy that dresses like</v>

1979
01:30:30.141 --> 01:30:32.350
<v Speaker 2>all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know the women stars and stuff like</v>

1980
01:30:32.351 --> 01:30:33.184
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1981
01:30:33.310 --> 01:30:38.310
<v Speaker 2>none of the actual people are here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are all impersonators of other</v>

1982
01:30:38.321 --> 01:30:39.154
<v Speaker 2>famous people.</v>

1983
01:30:39.280 --> 01:30:40.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1984
01:30:40.070 --> 01:30:43.300
<v Speaker 2>so the people can be famous and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>people pretending to be,</v>

1985
01:30:43.301 --> 01:30:45.340
<v Speaker 2>those people can also become famous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The weird.</v>

1986
01:30:45.360 --> 01:30:46.193
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1987
01:30:46.330 --> 01:30:47.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they get really good at it.</v>

1988
01:30:48.100 --> 01:30:52.210
<v Speaker 2>And that was everybody in that casino</v>
<v Speaker 2>was a fake something else.</v>

1989
01:30:52.360 --> 01:30:53.350
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever seen that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1990
01:30:53.500 --> 01:30:56.770
<v Speaker 2>Frank Marino guy that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's one of the guys I was talking</v>

1991
01:30:56.771 --> 01:30:57.241
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1992
01:30:57.241 --> 01:30:59.110
<v Speaker 2>I've never seen a show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I hear he's really good.</v>

1993
01:30:59.140 --> 01:31:02.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got like a whole show where he does</v>

1994
01:31:03.160 --> 01:31:04.540
<v Speaker 2>famous women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1995
01:31:04.660 --> 01:31:05.493
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1996
01:31:05.770 --> 01:31:07.330
<v Speaker 2>are you allowed to call them drag queens</v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore?</v>

1997
01:31:07.390 --> 01:31:08.350
<v Speaker 2>I I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

1998
01:31:08.590 --> 01:31:12.370
<v Speaker 2>I'm not gonna I'm not gonna say that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm afraid to say any term about anybody</v>

1999
01:31:12.490 --> 01:31:13.323
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>

2000
01:31:15.610 --> 01:31:18.040
<v Speaker 2>Have you had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have you ever had even off person is</v>

2001
01:31:18.041 --> 01:31:20.020
<v Speaker 2>offensive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even like to use the word person</v>

2002
01:31:20.021 --> 01:31:23.410
<v Speaker 2>cause I'm sure somebody out there going</v>
<v Speaker 2>who you calling a person black diamond</v>

2003
01:31:23.530 --> 01:31:26.110
<v Speaker 2>the best neil diamond tribute on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>planet.</v>

2004
01:31:26.860 --> 01:31:28.720
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

2005
01:31:28.900 --> 01:31:31.040
<v Speaker 2>I would've remembered,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2006
01:31:31.720 --> 01:31:35.320
<v Speaker 2>or maybe he did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe black diamond was so good at it</v>

2007
01:31:35.500 --> 01:31:38.050
<v Speaker 2>that I didn't realize during the show</v>
<v Speaker 2>that he was black.</v>

2008
01:31:38.440 --> 01:31:41.800
<v Speaker 2>Don't you feel like that this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean as far as like comedy,</v>

2009
01:31:41.801 --> 01:31:44.290
<v Speaker 2>having a bunch of landmines that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>could accidentally step on,</v>

2010
01:31:44.550 --> 01:31:47.740
<v Speaker 2>this seems like the most fraught with</v>
<v Speaker 2>peril time ever.</v>

2011
01:31:48.610 --> 01:31:50.890
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you make of this?</v>

2012
01:31:51.090 --> 01:31:53.620
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I Dunno.</v>

2013
01:31:53.650 --> 01:31:55.270
<v Speaker 2>It's definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2014
01:31:55.750 --> 01:31:58.570
<v Speaker 2>it's definitely an interesting time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2015
01:31:58.571 --> 01:32:00.580
<v Speaker 2>with everything been going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2016
01:32:01.840 --> 01:32:05.830
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what's weird about comedy too is</v>

2017
01:32:05.831 --> 01:32:10.720
<v Speaker 2>that part of what makes it interesting</v>
<v Speaker 2>is pushing the envelope and be,</v>

2018
01:32:10.960 --> 01:32:15.960
<v Speaker 2>and people need to be willing to cross</v>
<v Speaker 2>the line to see what's over there.</v>

2019
01:32:16.960 --> 01:32:19.030
<v Speaker 2>I don't really do a lot of that kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>comedy,</v>

2020
01:32:19.031 --> 01:32:21.460
<v Speaker 2>but I liked that there are people that</v>
<v Speaker 2>do that kind of comedy,</v>

2021
01:32:22.150 --> 01:32:27.150
<v Speaker 2>but that in conjunction with a</v>
<v Speaker 2>politically click correct world is a</v>

2022
01:32:28.931 --> 01:32:31.750
<v Speaker 2>very strange place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2023
01:32:31.990 --> 01:32:35.710
<v Speaker 2>It's a very strange place and people are</v>
<v Speaker 2>looking for someone to step over those</v>

2024
01:32:35.711 --> 01:32:37.510
<v Speaker 2>lines so they can attack them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

2025
01:32:38.230 --> 01:32:40.720
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are forbidden subjects.</v>

2026
01:32:41.080 --> 01:32:44.770
<v Speaker 2>There's forbidden words.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's forbidden takes on things.</v>

2027
01:32:46.300 --> 01:32:48.100
<v Speaker 2>I'm in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is going to sound like I'm</v>

2028
01:32:48.190 --> 01:32:51.520
<v Speaker 2>plugging,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm in this TV thing that Peter Fairly</v>

2029
01:32:51.521 --> 01:32:54.160
<v Speaker 2>is directing called loudermilk and it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>such a plugin.</v>

2030
01:32:54.880 --> 01:32:56.830
<v Speaker 2>That's the plug.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm glad I'm done with the plug.</v>

2031
01:32:57.130 --> 01:32:59.950
<v Speaker 2>It's about milk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Loudermilk it's a valley brothers from</v>

2032
01:32:59.951 --> 01:33:01.090
<v Speaker 2>dumb and dumber.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

2033
01:33:01.270 --> 01:33:02.920
<v Speaker 2>Fucking geniuses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2034
01:33:02.921 --> 01:33:06.430
<v Speaker 2>And I'm honored to be in the show and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a tiny little part in a thing and</v>

2035
01:33:06.431 --> 01:33:07.840
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's about substance abuse.</v>

2036
01:33:07.840 --> 01:33:11.470
<v Speaker 2>Ron Livingston plays the main character</v>
<v Speaker 2>loudermilk and it's about substance</v>

2037
01:33:11.471 --> 01:33:13.060
<v Speaker 2>abuse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's done in a very funny way.</v>

2038
01:33:13.450 --> 01:33:18.450
<v Speaker 2>So one of the first reviews that I read,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I read a comment about it and</v>

2039
01:33:19.181 --> 01:33:22.720
<v Speaker 2>somebody wrote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how dare somebody make fun of substance</v>

2040
01:33:22.721 --> 01:33:26.650
<v Speaker 2>abuse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing funny about substance</v>

2041
01:33:26.651 --> 01:33:27.610
<v Speaker 2>abuse and it was just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2042
01:33:27.611 --> 01:33:32.611
<v Speaker 2>some person out in the Internet and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it just bothers me that people draw</v>

2043
01:33:33.911 --> 01:33:37.720
<v Speaker 2>these lines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there's something funny about</v>

2044
01:33:37.721 --> 01:33:38.950
<v Speaker 2>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything,</v>

2045
01:33:39.250 --> 01:33:41.930
<v Speaker 2>everything that he said.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It depends on what you want to say about</v>

2046
01:33:41.931 --> 01:33:43.600
<v Speaker 2>it and what your point of view is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2047
01:33:43.630 --> 01:33:46.240
<v Speaker 2>every subject is fair game as far as I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>concerned.</v>

2048
01:33:46.630 --> 01:33:49.270
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It depends on what your position is.</v>

2049
01:33:49.271 --> 01:33:50.640
<v Speaker 2>What's your point of view on it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2050
01:33:50.660 --> 01:33:53.350
<v Speaker 2>The idea that there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's subjects that cannot be breached</v>

2051
01:33:53.351 --> 01:33:54.850
<v Speaker 2>is preposterous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Crazy.</v>

2052
01:33:54.880 --> 01:33:56.620
<v Speaker 2>I agree,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it just,</v>

2053
01:33:56.860 --> 01:33:57.700
<v Speaker 2>what is it?</v>

2054
01:33:57.760 --> 01:34:02.020
<v Speaker 2>I think it's that there's more people</v>
<v Speaker 2>that have the ability to complain about</v>

2055
01:34:02.021 --> 01:34:04.300
<v Speaker 2>things now than ever before because of</v>
<v Speaker 2>social media.</v>

2056
01:34:04.900 --> 01:34:07.660
<v Speaker 2>You can be in your underwear now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fact that you can be in your</v>

2057
01:34:07.661 --> 01:34:09.580
<v Speaker 2>underwear and feel like you're a</v>
<v Speaker 2>mouthpiece,</v>

2058
01:34:09.830 --> 01:34:11.440
<v Speaker 2>you're literally at home in your</v>
<v Speaker 2>underwear,</v>

2059
01:34:11.680 --> 01:34:14.050
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>typing on on and I'm like this.</v>

2060
01:34:14.460 --> 01:34:15.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you could write some great shit in</v>

2061
01:34:15.861 --> 01:34:16.990
<v Speaker 2>your underwear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2062
01:34:16.991 --> 01:34:18.820
<v Speaker 2>I don't care what you're wearing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just care.</v>

2063
01:34:19.660 --> 01:34:21.280
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking about a critic.</v>

2064
01:34:21.680 --> 01:34:23.400
<v Speaker 2>Anybody anywhere saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2065
01:34:23.450 --> 01:34:23.840
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2066
01:34:23.840 --> 01:34:26.920
<v Speaker 2>You got to be a great critic and your</v>
<v Speaker 2>underwear and write a brilliant,</v>

2067
01:34:26.921 --> 01:34:28.690
<v Speaker 2>that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Peace on something that's true.</v>

2068
01:34:28.930 --> 01:34:29.890
<v Speaker 2>I don't really care what they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>wearing,</v>

2069
01:34:29.980 --> 01:34:31.990
<v Speaker 2>but I see what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I'm just,</v>

2070
01:34:32.170 --> 01:34:35.110
<v Speaker 2>my point is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anybody anywhere can have an opinion</v>

2071
01:34:35.111 --> 01:34:37.120
<v Speaker 2>about anything at any time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>

2072
01:34:37.580 --> 01:34:41.320
<v Speaker 2>and in a way that's good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in a way you're going to get some</v>

2073
01:34:41.321 --> 01:34:42.880
<v Speaker 2>under qualified opinions.</v>

2074
01:34:43.090 --> 01:34:45.730
<v Speaker 2>You definitely gonna get that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to get a lot of opinions</v>

2075
01:34:45.731 --> 01:34:48.700
<v Speaker 2>from people that you would never choose</v>
<v Speaker 2>to talk to in real life.</v>

2076
01:34:49.900 --> 01:34:51.970
<v Speaker 2>You just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would weed them out,</v>

2077
01:34:52.240 --> 01:34:54.670
<v Speaker 2>but you can't weed them out online</v>
<v Speaker 2>because everyone's just text.</v>

2078
01:34:55.210 --> 01:34:56.250
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2079
01:34:56.260 --> 01:35:01.260
<v Speaker 2>and comedy is weird because everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody has what their sense of humor</v>

2080
01:35:02.481 --> 01:35:04.040
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2081
01:35:04.041 --> 01:35:06.930
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so everybody thinks that the,</v>

2082
01:35:07.400 --> 01:35:10.520
<v Speaker 2>I've always been amazed that people</v>
<v Speaker 2>think that their sense of humor is the</v>

2083
01:35:10.521 --> 01:35:13.760
<v Speaker 2>correct one when people make these</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolute statements going,</v>

2084
01:35:14.690 --> 01:35:17.630
<v Speaker 2>he's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's not funny.</v>

2085
01:35:17.810 --> 01:35:19.940
<v Speaker 2>She is funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not funny.</v>

2086
01:35:21.100 --> 01:35:24.680
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] who made you the comedy</v>
<v Speaker 2>barometer?</v>

2087
01:35:24.920 --> 01:35:27.800
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas other art forms,</v>

2088
01:35:28.730 --> 01:35:33.440
<v Speaker 2>most people are wise enough to go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if somebody that goes to a ballet</v>

2089
01:35:33.441 --> 01:35:35.600
<v Speaker 2>and doesn't like it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2090
01:35:35.601 --> 01:35:37.640
<v Speaker 2>at least you're wise enough to go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

2091
01:35:37.700 --> 01:35:39.110
<v Speaker 2>I don't appreciate the ballet.</v>

2092
01:35:39.110 --> 01:35:42.260
<v Speaker 2>You don't walk out going that Ballerina</v>
<v Speaker 2>socks.</v>

2093
01:35:42.620 --> 01:35:45.770
<v Speaker 2>There's gotta be some critical Ballerina</v>
<v Speaker 2>critics.</v>

2094
01:35:45.800 --> 01:35:46.730
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure,</v>

2095
01:35:47.120 --> 01:35:48.620
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just because you don't like</v>

2096
01:35:48.621 --> 01:35:50.630
<v Speaker 2>something doesn't mean it wasn't good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2097
01:35:50.660 --> 01:35:53.150
<v Speaker 2>But it's not good to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's the case was fair Isaac.</v>

2098
01:35:53.360 --> 01:35:54.470
<v Speaker 2>But isn't that with everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2099
01:35:54.500 --> 01:35:55.670
<v Speaker 2>Music,</v>
<v Speaker 2>movies,</v>

2100
01:35:55.671 --> 01:35:58.280
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of things that people love</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's fair,</v>

2101
01:35:58.281 --> 01:35:59.870
<v Speaker 2>but if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you qualify it that way,</v>

2102
01:36:00.230 --> 01:36:01.940
<v Speaker 2>if you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't find that person funny.</v>

2103
01:36:01.941 --> 01:36:02.930
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2104
01:36:03.020 --> 01:36:06.110
<v Speaker 2>But to put,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to make the blanket statement that he's</v>

2105
01:36:06.111 --> 01:36:07.520
<v Speaker 2>not funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not funny.</v>

2106
01:36:07.521 --> 01:36:11.150
<v Speaker 2>It's not up to you to say comedy is a</v>
<v Speaker 2>weird thing too,</v>

2107
01:36:11.151 --> 01:36:15.680
<v Speaker 2>in that it's one term that applies to a</v>
<v Speaker 2>bunch of different styles.</v>

2108
01:36:16.760 --> 01:36:19.610
<v Speaker 2>Whereas music,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can go to see country western music,</v>

2109
01:36:19.611 --> 01:36:21.260
<v Speaker 2>you could see rap,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rock and roll.</v>

2110
01:36:21.261 --> 01:36:23.490
<v Speaker 2>There's all these different genres,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2111
01:36:23.530 --> 01:36:24.620
<v Speaker 2>Comedy is not like that.</v>

2112
01:36:24.620 --> 01:36:28.460
<v Speaker 2>It's just is it funny or is it not?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why it was always weird when</v>

2113
01:36:28.461 --> 01:36:32.360
<v Speaker 2>comedy clubs started exploding around</v>
<v Speaker 2>the country and there would be this</v>

2114
01:36:32.390 --> 01:36:37.390
<v Speaker 2>building that said comedy club on it and</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pittsburgh or de Moines and music.</v>

2115
01:36:40.701 --> 01:36:42.080
<v Speaker 2>Like you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a subdivided,</v>

2116
01:36:42.650 --> 01:36:43.770
<v Speaker 2>you don't just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2117
01:36:43.771 --> 01:36:46.070
<v Speaker 2>just go to a music club.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

2118
01:36:46.071 --> 01:36:48.410
<v Speaker 2>there's the music club.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you want to go hear music?</v>

2119
01:36:48.470 --> 01:36:50.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well everybody likes music,</v>

2120
01:36:50.630 --> 01:36:52.700
<v Speaker 2>but not everybody likes the same kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>music.</v>

2121
01:36:53.240 --> 01:36:56.270
<v Speaker 2>Comedy is not subdivided.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not,</v>

2122
01:36:56.510 --> 01:36:58.160
<v Speaker 2>not that I'm saying that it should be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

2123
01:36:58.790 --> 01:37:02.620
<v Speaker 2>but to just go into a room that says</v>
<v Speaker 2>comedy on it and think that you're</v>

2124
01:37:02.690 --> 01:37:05.330
<v Speaker 2>automatically going to be entertained is</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of ludicrous.</v>

2125
01:37:05.600 --> 01:37:07.820
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's hard though if you don't know</v>

2126
01:37:07.821 --> 01:37:09.080
<v Speaker 2>who the comics are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2127
01:37:09.140 --> 01:37:11.960
<v Speaker 2>It's like you don't know what their take</v>
<v Speaker 2>on things it's going to be.</v>

2128
01:37:11.960 --> 01:37:14.240
<v Speaker 2>And that's one of the things about a</v>
<v Speaker 2>nice local club.</v>

2129
01:37:14.241 --> 01:37:16.560
<v Speaker 2>Like say if you live in Nashville and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go to Zania,</v>

2130
01:37:16.800 --> 01:37:17.391
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2131
01:37:17.391 --> 01:37:19.460
<v Speaker 2>I never heard of this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's been on comedy central,</v>

2132
01:37:19.461 --> 01:37:22.280
<v Speaker 2>let's take a chance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You literally have no idea what this</v>

2133
01:37:22.281 --> 01:37:23.570
<v Speaker 2>person's take is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2134
01:37:24.110 --> 01:37:26.180
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's great that you can go to a</v>

2135
01:37:26.181 --> 01:37:28.970
<v Speaker 2>place like that or you can go to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Improv and Hollywood and you'll see like</v>

2136
01:37:28.971 --> 01:37:32.060
<v Speaker 2>10 different comedians one night or the</v>
<v Speaker 2>comedy store or where have you,</v>

2137
01:37:32.360 --> 01:37:35.900
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't know what you're going to get.</v>

2138
01:37:37.100 --> 01:37:40.400
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which I think would be part of the fun.</v>

2139
01:37:40.460 --> 01:37:41.330
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For sure.</v>

2140
01:37:41.360 --> 01:37:43.370
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for some people who like,</v>

2141
01:37:44.150 --> 01:37:44.871
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2142
01:37:44.871 --> 01:37:46.970
<v Speaker 2>want to draw a line and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that person doesn't funny so</v>

2143
01:37:46.971 --> 01:37:48.590
<v Speaker 2>therefore I didn't have a good time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's like,</v>

2144
01:37:48.591 --> 01:37:51.470
<v Speaker 2>well you just took a chance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the great parts about something</v>

2145
01:37:51.471 --> 01:37:54.080
<v Speaker 2>like the comedy store where you get a</v>
<v Speaker 2>new person every 15 minutes,</v>

2146
01:37:54.081 --> 01:37:55.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's constantly new people.</v>

2147
01:37:56.530 --> 01:37:58.560
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you writing over that,</v>

2148
01:37:58.561 --> 01:38:01.850
<v Speaker 1>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've written emails to Miami,</v>

2149
01:38:01.860 --> 01:38:03.600
<v Speaker 1>people would always hit me up during the</v>
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>

2150
01:38:04.700 --> 01:38:09.210
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what like when you see comedy today,</v>

2151
01:38:09.390 --> 01:38:12.240
<v Speaker 1>do you think that you would have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2152
01:38:12.241 --> 01:38:13.890
<v Speaker 1>you think about like when you first</v>
<v Speaker 1>started,</v>

2153
01:38:14.010 --> 01:38:16.550
<v Speaker 1>do you think you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would feel the same way about stand</v>

2154
01:38:16.551 --> 01:38:18.420
<v Speaker 1>up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you had to start out today by</v>

2155
01:38:18.450 --> 01:38:22.230
<v Speaker 1>seeing how it's all fraught with peril.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think you would have jumped in</v>

2156
01:38:22.231 --> 01:38:23.580
<v Speaker 1>any way?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno.</v>

2157
01:38:23.760 --> 01:38:24.750
<v Speaker 1>It feels different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2158
01:38:24.980 --> 01:38:27.050
<v Speaker 2>It does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's a,</v>

2159
01:38:27.051 --> 01:38:30.530
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there were a lot fewer people doing it</v>

2160
01:38:30.531 --> 01:38:33.740
<v Speaker 2>when I started.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And to me it was just this internal</v>

2161
01:38:33.741 --> 01:38:36.560
<v Speaker 2>quest that came from within myself that</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to do this.</v>

2162
01:38:36.950 --> 01:38:40.610
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and comedy evolves and now there is a</v>

2163
01:38:40.611 --> 01:38:44.810
<v Speaker 2>lot of autobiographical kind of comedy</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a lot of people really going into</v>

2164
01:38:44.811 --> 01:38:48.410
<v Speaker 2>their heart and soul and talking about</v>
<v Speaker 2>how they feel and stuff like that.</v>

2165
01:38:48.411 --> 01:38:50.480
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I love all comedy,</v>

2166
01:38:50.990 --> 01:38:54.050
<v Speaker 2>but my comedy kind of comes from a</v>
<v Speaker 2>different perspective.</v>

2167
01:38:54.051 --> 01:38:56.750
<v Speaker 2>It's more observational and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2168
01:38:56.870 --> 01:38:59.900
<v Speaker 2>so I don't know if I were to watch all</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the comedy now,</v>

2169
01:38:59.901 --> 01:39:01.970
<v Speaker 2>if I would go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to jump into that pool.</v>

2170
01:39:02.780 --> 01:39:03.730
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to think I would,</v>

2171
01:39:03.780 --> 01:39:04.680
<v Speaker 1>but I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

2172
01:39:05.040 --> 01:39:06.660
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd love your comedy and your comedy is</v>

2173
01:39:06.661 --> 01:39:09.810
<v Speaker 1>very observational and very silly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I always wonder,</v>

2174
01:39:09.811 --> 01:39:14.811
<v Speaker 1>like I wonder</v>
<v Speaker 1>today it seems like there's way more</v>

2175
01:39:15.211 --> 01:39:18.900
<v Speaker 1>uncensored comedy then there was when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you started on your me also,</v>

2176
01:39:19.150 --> 01:39:21.780
<v Speaker 1>you're one of the rare guys where are</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking hilarious.</v>

2177
01:39:21.781 --> 01:39:23.910
<v Speaker 1>Like anybody can go see you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anybody.</v>

2178
01:39:24.060 --> 01:39:25.650
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you can bring children,</v>

2179
01:39:26.010 --> 01:39:28.770
<v Speaker 1>old people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>young people in the middle.</v>

2180
01:39:29.250 --> 01:39:29.971
<v Speaker 1>Anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2181
01:39:29.971 --> 01:39:31.410
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're your comedy reaches,</v>

2182
01:39:31.770 --> 01:39:33.240
<v Speaker 1>you're probably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my opinion,</v>

2183
01:39:33.241 --> 01:39:36.060
<v Speaker 1>the most hilarious guy that reaches to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the widest audience.</v>

2184
01:39:36.330 --> 01:39:38.670
<v Speaker 1>I appreciate that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an amazing thing that you've</v>

2185
01:39:38.700 --> 01:39:42.360
<v Speaker 1>figured out how to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you just figured out how to hit</v>

2186
01:39:42.361 --> 01:39:47.361
<v Speaker 1>this middle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like this area where you could really</v>

2187
01:39:48.001 --> 01:39:52.920
<v Speaker 1>bring anybody to your show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But everybody that I know really thinks</v>

2188
01:39:52.921 --> 01:39:54.790
<v Speaker 1>you're a very funny comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's,</v>

2189
01:39:54.791 --> 01:39:56.040
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very unusual.</v>

2190
01:39:56.041 --> 01:39:57.900
<v Speaker 1>Like a lot of times when a guy's like</v>
<v Speaker 1>squeaky clean,</v>

2191
01:39:58.180 --> 01:39:59.090
<v Speaker 2>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>

2192
01:39:59.270 --> 01:40:02.420
<v Speaker 2>it does not for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but everybody thinks you're funny.</v>

2193
01:40:02.480 --> 01:40:03.620
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a weird thing.</v>

2194
01:40:03.950 --> 01:40:05.690
<v Speaker 2>I'm very honored by that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Truly.</v>

2195
01:40:05.720 --> 01:40:07.430
<v Speaker 2>It means the world to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2196
01:40:07.431 --> 01:40:09.710
<v Speaker 2>I love,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love making audiences laugh obviously,</v>

2197
01:40:10.400 --> 01:40:14.390
<v Speaker 2>but to have comedians like what I do for</v>
<v Speaker 2>you to say nice things like that,</v>

2198
01:40:14.391 --> 01:40:16.580
<v Speaker 2>other comedians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2199
01:40:16.650 --> 01:40:18.020
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a tremendous honor.</v>

2200
01:40:18.290 --> 01:40:19.670
<v Speaker 2>What is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a real,</v>

2201
01:40:19.770 --> 01:40:22.620
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there it's a feat.</v>

2202
01:40:23.400 --> 01:40:25.410
<v Speaker 1>And Gaffigan's done it too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like Africans,</v>

2203
01:40:25.411 --> 01:40:28.650
<v Speaker 1>another guy who's just goddamn hilarious</v>
<v Speaker 1>but squeaky clean.</v>

2204
01:40:29.100 --> 01:40:30.630
<v Speaker 1>Anybody can go see him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

2205
01:40:30.631 --> 01:40:32.790
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very admirable and a lot of ways,</v>

2206
01:40:32.791 --> 01:40:35.070
<v Speaker 1>it's not a lot of guys like you guys</v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

2207
01:40:35.580 --> 01:40:37.560
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems like people are either squeaky</v>

2208
01:40:37.561 --> 01:40:41.250
<v Speaker 1>clean or they're really dirty and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't necessarily appeal to people.</v>

2209
01:40:41.251 --> 01:40:43.680
<v Speaker 1>Like both.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like very dirty comedy.</v>

2210
01:40:43.681 --> 01:40:46.140
<v Speaker 1>I love of look extreme uncensored</v>
<v Speaker 1>comedy,</v>

2211
01:40:46.141 --> 01:40:47.250
<v Speaker 1>but I also love your comedy.</v>

2212
01:40:48.350 --> 01:40:50.180
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel the same way.</v>

2213
01:40:50.230 --> 01:40:55.230
<v Speaker 2>What's weird for me is if somebody comes</v>
<v Speaker 2>up to me after a show and say,</v>

2214
01:40:57.490 --> 01:40:58.570
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I liked your show.</v>

2215
01:40:59.260 --> 01:41:00.430
<v Speaker 2>So great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thank you.</v>

2216
01:41:01.270 --> 01:41:03.130
<v Speaker 2>But then they want to like lean in and</v>
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>

2217
01:41:03.131 --> 01:41:06.100
<v Speaker 2>I'm glad you're not like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like them,</v>

2218
01:41:07.330 --> 01:41:07.761
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

2219
01:41:07.761 --> 01:41:12.550
<v Speaker 2>it's an us against them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I feel like saying I like them.</v>

2220
01:41:14.410 --> 01:41:16.840
<v Speaker 2>I like what they like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they do too.</v>

2221
01:41:16.841 --> 01:41:19.120
<v Speaker 2>And I like what I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the old,</v>

2222
01:41:19.540 --> 01:41:22.600
<v Speaker 2>remember when a stove top stuffing came</v>
<v Speaker 2>out,</v>

2223
01:41:23.170 --> 01:41:27.130
<v Speaker 2>stove top stuffing and the ad was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't you rather have stuffing as</v>

2224
01:41:27.250 --> 01:41:32.250
<v Speaker 2>instead of potatoes and as a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to think I want stuffing as well</v>

2225
01:41:32.321 --> 01:41:36.040
<v Speaker 2>as potatoes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want one over the other.</v>

2226
01:41:36.041 --> 01:41:39.760
<v Speaker 2>I want both of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So why can't both kinds of comedy exist</v>

2227
01:41:39.761 --> 01:41:42.830
<v Speaker 2>and be valid instead of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2228
01:41:42.850 --> 01:41:45.910
<v Speaker 2>I wish they'd stopped doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well there was a bunch of comics like</v>

2229
01:41:45.911 --> 01:41:48.940
<v Speaker 2>bill cosby.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bill Cosby was always saying that the</v>

2230
01:41:48.941 --> 01:41:51.520
<v Speaker 2>comedians that did dirty comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's something wrong with them.</v>

2231
01:41:51.521 --> 01:41:54.430
<v Speaker 2>Like he was one of the big ones there</v>
<v Speaker 2>was pushing against it.</v>

2232
01:41:54.640 --> 01:41:56.290
<v Speaker 2>See I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't feel that way,</v>

2233
01:41:56.320 --> 01:42:00.310
<v Speaker 2>I feel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I will say that I think there are at</v>

2234
01:42:00.311 --> 01:42:05.311
<v Speaker 2>least some comics who work blue who know</v>
<v Speaker 2>that pushing buttons,</v>

2235
01:42:06.941 --> 01:42:11.110
<v Speaker 2>we'll get a response.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would hope that it's a truthful</v>

2236
01:42:11.111 --> 01:42:14.890
<v Speaker 2>organic message that you want to give as</v>
<v Speaker 2>the comedian and if happens to be dirty,</v>

2237
01:42:14.891 --> 01:42:16.300
<v Speaker 2>if it happens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it happens to be Raunchy.</v>

2238
01:42:16.690 --> 01:42:18.820
<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you're onstage going,</v>

2239
01:42:18.821 --> 01:42:22.660
<v Speaker 2>I know if I say fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll laugh,</v>

2240
01:42:23.320 --> 01:42:25.720
<v Speaker 2>then it gets to button pushing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2241
01:42:25.780 --> 01:42:28.900
<v Speaker 2>And I find that to be a little like less</v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting to me.</v>

2242
01:42:29.200 --> 01:42:30.340
<v Speaker 2>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2243
01:42:30.370 --> 01:42:33.940
<v Speaker 2>It's all about whether or not it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>really authentically that person's</v>

2244
01:42:33.941 --> 01:42:36.100
<v Speaker 2>interpretation of life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

2245
01:42:36.100 --> 01:42:38.830
<v Speaker 2>And some people like whether it's Joey</v>
<v Speaker 2>Diaz or something like that,</v>

2246
01:42:38.831 --> 01:42:42.930
<v Speaker 2>it's just a very uncensored person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like talking to him offstage,</v>

2247
01:42:42.970 --> 01:42:46.420
<v Speaker 2>talking to him onstage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pretty similar.</v>

2248
01:42:46.690 --> 01:42:50.230
<v Speaker 2>Same Guy as far as how he views the</v>
<v Speaker 2>world and it just figured out a way to</v>

2249
01:42:50.231 --> 01:42:52.510
<v Speaker 2>turn that into an art form and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

2250
01:42:52.511 --> 01:42:53.620
<v Speaker 2>you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's other people that are,</v>

2251
01:42:53.621 --> 01:42:56.830
<v Speaker 2>it's almost like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's almost like they could have been a</v>

2252
01:42:56.831 --> 01:42:59.730
<v Speaker 2>plumber,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but instead they decided to be a comics</v>

2253
01:42:59.740 --> 01:43:00.271
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hmm,</v>

2254
01:43:00.271 --> 01:43:01.780
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do I make this work?</v>

2255
01:43:02.610 --> 01:43:03.300
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2256
01:43:03.300 --> 01:43:05.410
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing wrong with being a plumber,</v>

2257
01:43:05.411 --> 01:43:10.411
<v Speaker 2>but what I'm saying is that what they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing is manufactured and sort of just</v>

2258
01:43:11.680 --> 01:43:14.440
<v Speaker 2>artificial.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's putting the audience first.</v>

2259
01:43:14.500 --> 01:43:16.120
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What will they laugh at?</v>

2260
01:43:16.210 --> 01:43:17.140
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see that.</v>

2261
01:43:17.141 --> 01:43:19.360
<v Speaker 2>They'll laugh if you talk about this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that and the other.</v>

2262
01:43:19.361 --> 01:43:22.570
<v Speaker 2>So therefore I will talk about this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that and the other instead of it coming</v>

2263
01:43:22.571 --> 01:43:23.404
<v Speaker 2>from inside you.</v>

2264
01:43:23.980 --> 01:43:28.930
<v Speaker 2>You mentioned earlier about me figuring</v>
<v Speaker 2>out a way to read,</v>

2265
01:43:29.200 --> 01:43:32.230
<v Speaker 2>reach a wide audience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I appreciate the kind words,</v>

2266
01:43:32.830 --> 01:43:35.950
<v Speaker 2>but I never went that route.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2267
01:43:36.550 --> 01:43:40.570
<v Speaker 2>I just want to do what I think is good</v>
<v Speaker 2>and wherever it lands,</v>

2268
01:43:40.571 --> 01:43:43.750
<v Speaker 2>it lands and the fact that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2269
01:43:43.780 --> 01:43:48.780
<v Speaker 2>maybe a 10 year old kid can you get into</v>
<v Speaker 2>it and maybe a 78 year old woman can get</v>

2270
01:43:49.031 --> 01:43:50.950
<v Speaker 2>into it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>

2271
01:43:50.990 --> 01:43:52.320
<v Speaker 2>But that's not something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2272
01:43:52.390 --> 01:43:54.020
<v Speaker 2>I don't lie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't try to figure that out.</v>

2273
01:43:54.110 --> 01:43:54.771
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't go,</v>

2274
01:43:54.771 --> 01:43:57.020
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what can I do to get this wide range?</v>

2275
01:43:57.170 --> 01:44:00.680
<v Speaker 2>I just do what I do and whatever happens</v>
<v Speaker 2>happens,</v>

2276
01:44:00.920 --> 01:44:03.440
<v Speaker 2>and I'm just fortunate that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it ended that way.</v>

2277
01:44:03.590 --> 01:44:04.341
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no way.</v>

2278
01:44:04.341 --> 01:44:06.020
<v Speaker 2>You can tell that when you're on stage</v>
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>

2279
01:44:06.380 --> 01:44:07.250
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>aren't you a,</v>

2280
01:44:07.251 --> 01:44:08.630
<v Speaker 2>you're getting ready to do another</v>
<v Speaker 2>special,</v>

2281
01:44:09.320 --> 01:44:12.770
<v Speaker 2>I just did a special Jesus that's going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to Air November,</v>

2282
01:44:13.040 --> 01:44:14.570
<v Speaker 2>November 21st it's called.</v>

2283
01:44:14.570 --> 01:44:18.530
<v Speaker 2>Oh Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's an errand on Netflix?</v>

2284
01:44:18.560 --> 01:44:19.550
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>awesome man.</v>

2285
01:44:19.670 --> 01:44:22.520
<v Speaker 2>I have a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing two specials for Netflix.</v>

2286
01:44:22.521 --> 01:44:26.210
<v Speaker 2>The first one comes out November 21st</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then I'll be doing another one in</v>
