<v Speaker 1>Five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>four,</v>

2
00:00:02.851 --> 00:00:04.710
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two.</v>

3
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:07.900
<v Speaker 1>Hello,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nick and Joe,</v>

4
00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:11.340
<v Speaker 1>sorry for the delay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We had a a failure.</v>

5
00:00:11.341 --> 00:00:15.150
<v Speaker 1>Ladies and gentlemen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>catastrophic failure of windows updating</v>

6
00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:16.373
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of a updated and hung on the </v>

7
00:00:18.601 --> 00:00:21.510
<v Speaker 1>tricaster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're back and it seems to be fine.</v>

8
00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:23.460
<v Speaker 1>Everything's working.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Allegedly,</v>

9
00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.370
<v Speaker 1>allegedly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a,</v>

10
00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:26.850
<v Speaker 1>there's that fear when you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

11
00:00:26.851 --> 00:00:28.680
<v Speaker 1>I'm turning off the update.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to start again.</v>

12
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.140
<v Speaker 1>The unit is everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is the one annoying thing.</v>

13
00:00:31.141 --> 00:00:32.670
<v Speaker 1>We were talking about this before the </v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast.</v>

14
00:00:32.671 --> 00:00:35.430
<v Speaker 1>I have been using windows to write on </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I like,</v>

15
00:00:35.431 --> 00:00:37.220
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thinkpad I really like.</v>

16
00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:39.000
<v Speaker 1>I love the keyboard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's great to write on,</v>

17
00:00:39.001 --> 00:00:42.900
<v Speaker 1>but windows updates like two or three </v>
<v Speaker 1>times a day sometimes.</v>

18
00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:44.213
<v Speaker 1>Not just windows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like Lenovo will update and there's </v>

19
00:00:46.831 --> 00:00:47.664
<v Speaker 1>some sort of firmware update and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bios update and Adobe Acrobat checking </v>

20
00:00:52.171 --> 00:00:56.010
<v Speaker 1>in and want to know if we can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>defender updates.</v>

21
00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:57.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the uh,</v>

22
00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.963
<v Speaker 1>I haven't used the thinkpad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They got this little clip right in the </v>

23
00:01:00.361 --> 00:01:02.970
<v Speaker 1>middle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't use it.</v>

24
00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.270
<v Speaker 1>I guess it's for people that have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>using it for ever.</v>

25
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.210
<v Speaker 1>It's very accurate if you do use it </v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

26
00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.180
<v Speaker 1>It's like one of those things where you </v>
<v Speaker 1>just sort of used to muscle memory.</v>

27
00:01:12.181 --> 00:01:13.014
<v Speaker 1>You're used to doing it and then they </v>
<v Speaker 1>touch the other buttons with their </v>

28
00:01:14.731 --> 00:01:15.660
<v Speaker 1>thumb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

29
00:01:15.661 --> 00:01:16.494
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can still do shit and it has the </v>

30
00:01:17.311 --> 00:01:20.460
<v Speaker 1>mouse at the keypad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has both.</v>

31
00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.760
<v Speaker 1>It's so weird how quickly you become </v>
<v Speaker 1>accustomed to some new version of things</v>

32
00:01:23.761 --> 00:01:24.594
<v Speaker 1>like I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been using my ipad and I it and </v>

33
00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:27.513
<v Speaker 1>then I've gone back to my computer and </v>
<v Speaker 1>my little Mac book and I find even that </v>

34
00:01:31.501 --> 00:01:34.100
<v Speaker 1>weird like I find myself just wanting to</v>
<v Speaker 1>touch the screen.</v>

35
00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.590
<v Speaker 1>I have my muscle memory is immediately </v>
<v Speaker 1>shot.</v>

36
00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.470
<v Speaker 1>That's one thing that's very odd about </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mac computers.</v>

37
00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.010
<v Speaker 1>They still have it embraced the </v>
<v Speaker 1>touchscreen laptop,</v>

38
00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:45.293
<v Speaker 1>whereas the thinkpad acts has a touch </v>
<v Speaker 1>screen or you can straight up use this </v>

39
00:01:48.661 --> 00:01:49.680
<v Speaker 1>screen on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

40
00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:52.860
<v Speaker 1>It's an option.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have one that has a touch screen and one</v>

41
00:01:52.861 --> 00:01:55.380
<v Speaker 1>that does not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's a lot of windows.</v>

42
00:01:55.381 --> 00:01:56.214
<v Speaker 1>Computers have touchscreens and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>even have it so you can turn it into a </v>

43
00:01:59.341 --> 00:02:01.620
<v Speaker 1>tablet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You flipped it over and it.</v>

44
00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.990
<v Speaker 1>I think they call it the yoga,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thinkpad,</v>

45
00:02:03.991 --> 00:02:04.824
<v Speaker 1>Yoga,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then Microsoft has one the surface </v>

46
00:02:06.841 --> 00:02:08.040
<v Speaker 1>or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

47
00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.180
<v Speaker 1>Apple's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

48
00:02:09.181 --> 00:02:10.680
<v Speaker 1>we want to sell you two different </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

49
00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.060
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not combining their dirty people.</v>

50
00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.090
<v Speaker 1>They really are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That fucking battery thing really pissed</v>

51
00:02:18.091 --> 00:02:19.550
<v Speaker 1>me off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did it come out?</v>

52
00:02:19.551 --> 00:02:21.900
<v Speaker 1>Did it finally get officially admitted </v>
<v Speaker 1>it?</v>

53
00:02:21.901 --> 00:02:23.210
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They said they,</v>

54
00:02:23.211 --> 00:02:26.100
<v Speaker 1>they admitted it and they said they did </v>
<v Speaker 1>it because the old phones,</v>

55
00:02:26.101 --> 00:02:27.360
<v Speaker 1>they were trying to preserve the </v>
<v Speaker 1>battery.</v>

56
00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.350
<v Speaker 1>The fuck you were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were trying to piss people off.</v>

57
00:02:31.351 --> 00:02:32.600
<v Speaker 1>So they got a new phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

58
00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:33.703
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we all know exactly what it works on me </v>

59
00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:37.081
<v Speaker 1>every year and a half for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

60
00:02:37.081 --> 00:02:39.120

<v Speaker 1>minutes?</v>

<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I gotta get a new phone,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Is it too big?</v>

68
00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.010

<v Speaker 1>I've always gotten this,</v>

69
00:02:56.011 --> 00:02:56.970
<v Speaker 1>this size.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Walmart.</v>

70
00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:58.520
<v Speaker 1>It was perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

71
00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I got greedy.</v>

72
00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.260
<v Speaker 2>I want to go back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have some of those now.</v>

73
00:03:02.261 --> 00:03:05.160
<v Speaker 2>The smaller like the four of the five,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that little size.</v>

74
00:03:05.161 --> 00:03:05.994
<v Speaker 2>Why anyone was aware.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone had one the other day and I had </v>

75
00:03:08.141 --> 00:03:08.860
<v Speaker 2>it in my hand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

76
00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.600
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is nice.</v>

77
00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:12.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can text with one hand.</v>

78
00:03:12.491 --> 00:03:13.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

79
00:03:13.451 --> 00:03:17.500
<v Speaker 2>And I think they now make that one with </v>
<v Speaker 2>a higher power.</v>

80
00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.570
<v Speaker 2>It's that size,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's.</v>

81
00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:25.860
<v Speaker 2>And it fits in your hand square and that</v>
<v Speaker 2>the edges are hard.</v>

82
00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.010
<v Speaker 2>Fits in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Perfect.</v>

83
00:03:27.011 --> 00:03:28.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like a slip.</v>

84
00:03:28.241 --> 00:03:29.074
<v Speaker 2>This one feels like it's going to slip </v>
<v Speaker 2>out and you can't quite get around it </v>

85
00:03:31.301 --> 00:03:33.810
<v Speaker 2>the whole time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For one.</v>

<v Speaker 2>That one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It also has a headphone Jack.</v>

87
00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:39.820
<v Speaker 2>It's like the last of the Mohicans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They got rid of all of it.</v>

88
00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:40.661
<v Speaker 2>Oh No.</v>

93

<v Speaker 2>long time.</v>

<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they figured it out.</v>

101
00:04:10.931 --> 00:04:11.764
<v Speaker 2>They figured some shit out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's also just like if they figured out </v>

102
00:04:13.991 --> 00:04:15.490
<v Speaker 2>the lifestyle of something where you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>editing his show with a 13 inch Mac </v>

112
00:04:37.201 --> 00:04:37.720

<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>

119
00:04:51.701 --> 00:04:53.260
<v Speaker 2>I feel like your brain works that way a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little bit.</v>

120
00:04:53.261 --> 00:04:54.580
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I could,</v>

121
00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:55.683
<v Speaker 2>I just don't have any desire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like your brain has this at some </v>

122
00:04:59.201 --> 00:05:00.034
<v Speaker 2>point decided like my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a certain amount of capacity in </v>

123
00:05:02.381 --> 00:05:05.650
<v Speaker 2>my brain and I don't want to use any of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that for anything that I don't,</v>

124
00:05:05.651 --> 00:05:06.484
<v Speaker 2>I'm not interested in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a good point and sometimes some </v>

125
00:05:08.891 --> 00:05:10.170
<v Speaker 2>people like that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just like,</v>

126
00:05:10.171 --> 00:05:11.004
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never been drawn to anything like </v>

127
00:05:11.771 --> 00:05:12.604
<v Speaker 2>that and I'm just not interested.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like as soon as I could have someone </v>

128
00:05:14.921 --> 00:05:17.320
<v Speaker 2>else like do my taxes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

129
00:05:17.321 --> 00:05:18.880
<v Speaker 2>Yup,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to think about that.</v>

130
00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:20.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to do it.</v>

131
00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:21.850
<v Speaker 2>It's all about bandwidth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

132
00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:22.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what,</v>

133
00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:26.560
<v Speaker 2>what are you spending your thinking on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could do all those other things,</v>

134
00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.840
<v Speaker 2>but how much would that be?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Annoying.</v>

135
00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:30.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And how much would it fuck up the things</v>

136
00:05:30.881 --> 00:05:33.550
<v Speaker 2>that you liked to do and some people </v>
<v Speaker 2>love that stuff.</v>

137
00:05:33.551 --> 00:05:34.384
<v Speaker 2>Like I have a buddy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a buddy who's a successful actor </v>

138
00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:39.460
<v Speaker 2>who still does his own taxes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pays his right side,</v>

139
00:05:39.461 --> 00:05:41.230
<v Speaker 2>his own residual checks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

140
00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:43.170
<v Speaker 2>he fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he likes it get.</v>

141
00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:44.290
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

144
00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:50.590
<v Speaker 2>That brings you joy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This doesn't have to worry about getting</v>

145
00:05:50.591 --> 00:05:51.430
<v Speaker 2>ripped off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's.</v>

146
00:05:51.431 --> 00:05:53.650
<v Speaker 2>I think that's part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chuck Palahniuk was here.</v>

147
00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:56.370
<v Speaker 2>His agents stole all of his money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

148
00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:59.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>millions real that he's broke.</v>

149
00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:01.690
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How and what happened to the.</v>

<v Speaker 2>other people.</v>

153
00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:11.750
<v Speaker 2>They don't know where the money is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's hoping to get some of it back.</v>

154
00:06:11.751 --> 00:06:12.584
<v Speaker 2>They might be able to find some of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the agents stole from several </v>

155
00:06:15.021 --> 00:06:15.854
<v Speaker 2>different clients.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Although I just saw some madman and </v>

156
00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:21.080
<v Speaker 2>chuck writes books about like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>watch out.</v>

168
00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:53.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you have a,</v>

169
00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:57.020
<v Speaker 2>they will be able to find it if they got</v>
<v Speaker 2>a hold of your gps unit.</v>

170
00:06:57.021 --> 00:06:59.640
<v Speaker 2>But if you got like a Garmin gps unit </v>
<v Speaker 2>that people use,</v>

171
00:06:59.641 --> 00:07:00.474
<v Speaker 2>usually they go hiking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can need a mark where your campus </v>

172
00:07:02.691 --> 00:07:03.524

<v Speaker 2>you could do some low like Geo tagging </v>

<v Speaker 2>You could totally do that.</v>

174
00:07:06.321 --> 00:07:07.154
<v Speaker 2>You could go to the fucking woods and go</v>
<v Speaker 2>to a tree and dig a hole next to that </v>

175
00:07:11.121 --> 00:07:14.270
<v Speaker 2>tree deep into the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 2>drop a coffee can with a million dollars</v>

180
00:07:21.811 --> 00:07:24.440
<v Speaker 2>that's very pleasing and the idea of </v>
<v Speaker 2>like rolls of money and like,</v>

00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:27.200
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

183
00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:31.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was probably garbage bags.</v>

184
00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:33.590
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fargo was just on the other day and it's</v>

185
00:07:33.591 --> 00:07:35.080
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Buscemi Haydn,</v>

186
00:07:35.081 --> 00:07:36.320
<v Speaker 2>that money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then he like,</v>

187
00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:37.790
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

188
00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:38.683
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he takes it like he's got his window </v>

189
00:07:39.651 --> 00:07:40.484
<v Speaker 2>scraper and he's in the far,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just like desolate snow for miles </v>

190
00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:47.080
<v Speaker 2>and he just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he sticks the,</v>

191
00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:47.943
<v Speaker 2>like the window scraper into the snow to</v>
<v Speaker 2>mark where he's hitting the money and </v>

192
00:07:51.771 --> 00:07:52.311
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

193
00:07:52.311 --> 00:07:53.930
<v Speaker 2>this guy's fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's never getting that money.</v>

194
00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:58.790
<v Speaker 2>Like there's no horizon line.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just snow and fucking sky's groups.</v>

195
00:07:58.791 --> 00:08:00.740
<v Speaker 2>You ever watched the new version of it </v>
<v Speaker 2>with billy?</v>

196
00:08:00.741 --> 00:08:02.450
<v Speaker 2>Bob Thornton is good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I heard it's great.</v>

197
00:08:02.451 --> 00:08:06.190
<v Speaker 2>Season One's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Season two is I think for my money,</v>

198
00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:07.183
<v Speaker 2>the best television,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like season two of that show is </v>

199
00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:13.100
<v Speaker 2>unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And season three is very good.</v>

200
00:08:13.101 --> 00:08:18.101
<v Speaker 2>But season two is unfucking believable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like in the seventies who's in it?</v>

201
00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:21.760
<v Speaker 2>A Kirson Dunson it.</v>

202
00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:23.260
<v Speaker 2>But like Jesse Plemons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kiersten,</v>

203
00:08:23.261 --> 00:08:24.540
<v Speaker 2>dawn's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

204
00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:27.110
<v Speaker 2>who's the fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

205
00:08:27.111 --> 00:08:28.340
<v Speaker 2>I don't even remember,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's great.</v>

206
00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:29.760
<v Speaker 2>It's great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like that.</v>

207
00:08:29.761 --> 00:08:30.594
<v Speaker 2>I like all three seasons of that show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but season two to me is like </v>

208
00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:33.973
<v Speaker 2>unstoppable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are they still making it or are they </v>

209
00:08:35.151 --> 00:08:38.300
<v Speaker 2>done?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They might go make some more in a few in</v>

210
00:08:38.301 --> 00:08:39.860
<v Speaker 2>a year or two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they might.</v>

211
00:08:39.861 --> 00:08:40.694
<v Speaker 2>They were talking about making one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think Chris Rock might be attached to </v>

212
00:08:44.061 --> 00:08:44.781
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

213
00:08:44.781 --> 00:08:46.010
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

214
00:08:46.011 --> 00:08:48.740
<v Speaker 2>I saw something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw something like that,</v>

215
00:08:48.741 --> 00:08:50.960
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the deal is with it,</v>

216
00:08:50.961 --> 00:08:54.950
<v Speaker 2>but in season three is great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but season two is fucking home cooks.</v>

217
00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:56.190
<v Speaker 2>Half brother and sister</v>

218
00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:57.023
<v Speaker 1>in law must repay $12 million.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is this new list from 2010 when it </v>

219
00:09:00.421 --> 00:09:01.140
<v Speaker 1>happened?</v>

<v Speaker 1>probation.</v>

221
00:09:03.631 --> 00:09:08.631

<v Speaker 1>So He's six years in the pokey in 2010.</v>

222

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's.</v>

223
00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:11.153
<v Speaker 1>I think he just got out dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I remember seeing something </v>

224
00:09:13.501 --> 00:09:15.960
<v Speaker 1>about $10,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>was stolen from him.</v>

225
00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:18.540
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you do?</v>

228
00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:24.450
<v Speaker 1>How does that work for them in jail?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the guy just stayed in jail,</v>

229
00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:27.930
<v Speaker 1>like he could have a parent that's just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might be getting this wrong,</v>

230
00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:28.973
<v Speaker 1>but I do remember some of the story was </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they were offering leniency if it </v>

231
00:09:32.641 --> 00:09:33.680
<v Speaker 1>gave some of the money back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

360
00:15:19.691 --> 00:15:23.170

00:15:36.351 --> 00:15:38.050
<v Speaker 1>happy about this.</v>

369
00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:52.840
<v Speaker 1>a little stylists and things on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was</v>

370
00:15:53.090 --> 00:15:57.170
<v Speaker 3>in the years like between when jobs had </v>
<v Speaker 3>gotten fired and they were like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>These are like high school kids though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

465
00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:52.650
<v Speaker 2>This looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

466
00:19:52.651 --> 00:19:56.100
<v Speaker 2>They look very young.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's all legit.</v>

467
00:19:56.140 --> 00:19:58.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But how old were they?</v>

468
00:19:58.290 --> 00:20:01.410
<v Speaker 2>There were 18.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was no one who is 40.</v>

469
00:20:01.411 --> 00:20:02.580
<v Speaker 2>Who is doing that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

470
00:20:02.610 --> 00:20:03.443
<v Speaker 2>you go to the gym today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'll see guys who were in their </v>

471
00:20:05.041 --> 00:20:06.750
<v Speaker 2>fifties were jacked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

472
00:20:06.751 --> 00:20:08.420
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

473
00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:09.810
<v Speaker 2>It's a different world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And look at that.</v>

474
00:20:10.350 --> 00:20:11.400
<v Speaker 2>That looks fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey Man,</v>

475
00:20:11.401 --> 00:20:14.580
<v Speaker 2>I fucking love your show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This show is hilarious.</v>

476
00:20:14.581 --> 00:20:16.740
<v Speaker 2>Thanks man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that the character,</v>

477
00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:21.290
<v Speaker 2>the animation looks like you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has your lips and your nose.</v>

478
00:20:21.330 --> 00:20:24.130
<v Speaker 2>It's really weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

479
00:20:24.150 --> 00:20:26.130
<v Speaker 2>it looks like you without looking like </v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

480
00:20:26.130 --> 00:20:28.080
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They captured it.</v>

481
00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:29.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's weird.</v>

482
00:20:29.490 --> 00:20:31.770
<v Speaker 2>It's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone posted.</v>

483
00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:33.660
<v Speaker 2>It was right before the show came out </v>
<v Speaker 2>this year.</v>

484
00:20:33.661 --> 00:20:34.494
<v Speaker 2>Someone was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone posted like Japanese make we </v>

485
00:20:37.381 --> 00:20:38.214
<v Speaker 2>make our cartoons a cuter Americans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's make our characters ugly as </v>

486
00:20:44.101 --> 00:20:45.900
<v Speaker 2>fucking possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's.</v>

487
00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:49.860
<v Speaker 2>And it's mine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's me as it's me as a little kid.</v>

488
00:20:50.210 --> 00:20:51.880
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

489
00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:58.240
<v Speaker 2>that's exactly what I look like because </v>
<v Speaker 2>it looks like you without looking like,</v>

490
00:20:58.241 --> 00:20:59.490
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

491
00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:01.540
<v Speaker 2>There is a real gift to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When people,</v>

492
00:21:01.570 --> 00:21:04.120
<v Speaker 2>they figured out how to capture the </v>
<v Speaker 2>perfect caricature.</v>

493
00:21:04.150 --> 00:21:06.640
<v Speaker 2>It's weird that we and we give them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even when we,</v>

494
00:21:06.910 --> 00:21:08.440
<v Speaker 2>even if it's like we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we try to,</v>

495
00:21:08.441 --> 00:21:09.274
<v Speaker 2>like when we have new characters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll just give them pictures of the </v>

496
00:21:10.811 --> 00:21:14.590
<v Speaker 2>people that are playing them and just </v>
<v Speaker 2>let them find that version of them.</v>

497
00:21:14.980 --> 00:21:16.840
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and even when we don't,</v>

498
00:21:16.841 --> 00:21:20.950
<v Speaker 2>we'll give people references because </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's something about capturing a real</v>

499
00:21:20.951 --> 00:21:25.360
<v Speaker 2>person that makes it specific in a way </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you're like,</v>

500
00:21:25.361 --> 00:21:26.110
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

501
00:21:26.110 --> 00:21:28.240
<v Speaker 2>everybody can draw just like draw </v>
<v Speaker 2>whoever,</v>

502
00:21:28.241 --> 00:21:29.074
<v Speaker 2>which does work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but still there's something about like </v>

503
00:21:31.031 --> 00:21:33.190
<v Speaker 2>being like now we want to guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it looks like Rogan.</v>

504
00:21:33.190 --> 00:21:34.023
<v Speaker 2>Like they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll get that essence that create </v>

505
00:21:36.401 --> 00:21:38.590
<v Speaker 2>something that feels more real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so weird,</v>

506
00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:39.933
<v Speaker 2>but they're great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have a killer team of people </v>

507
00:21:41.890 --> 00:21:45.070
<v Speaker 2>designing all those characters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I love about your show is,</v>

508
00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:47.080
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like a lot of things about it,</v>

509
00:21:47.081 --> 00:21:47.914
<v Speaker 2>but one of the things that I love about </v>
<v Speaker 2>is that you really can only do that on </v>

510
00:21:50.171 --> 00:21:52.360
<v Speaker 2>Netflix.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just like there's,</v>

511
00:21:52.361 --> 00:21:55.250
<v Speaker 2>it's so unharnessed yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

512
00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:59.770
<v Speaker 2>it's just wild and hilarious and there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>no boundaries to it.</v>

513
00:22:00.170 --> 00:22:01.003
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the more amazing things </v>
<v Speaker 2>about something like Netflix is that </v>

514
00:22:04.031 --> 00:22:06.040
<v Speaker 2>there's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could do whatever,</v>

515
00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:08.710
<v Speaker 2>you can do whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can do whatever length you want,</v>

516
00:22:08.740 --> 00:22:12.010
<v Speaker 2>you can do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can say whatever you want,</v>

517
00:22:12.450 --> 00:22:13.283
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have no advertisers who you're </v>

518
00:22:15.370 --> 00:22:18.220
<v Speaker 2>either supporting or in competition </v>
<v Speaker 2>with.</v>

519
00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:22.060
<v Speaker 2>So we can mention brands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't really care about that.</v>

520
00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:23.990
<v Speaker 2>They don't care if there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

521
00:22:23.991 --> 00:22:26.440
<v Speaker 2>when you're a network tv,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like you got to get an act break,</v>

522
00:22:26.441 --> 00:22:28.390
<v Speaker 2>you got the first act has to be eight </v>
<v Speaker 2>minutes,</v>

523
00:22:28.391 --> 00:22:29.500
<v Speaker 2>second act has to be blah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>

524
00:22:29.501 --> 00:22:29.801
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>

525
00:22:29.801 --> 00:22:30.460
<v Speaker 2>blah.</v>

526
00:22:30.460 --> 00:22:33.280
<v Speaker 2>And even when there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's more flexibility now,</v>

527
00:22:33.281 --> 00:22:35.830
<v Speaker 2>but they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also most importantly,</v>

528
00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:38.740
<v Speaker 2>they just basically let us do whatever </v>
<v Speaker 2>the fuck we want.</v>

529
00:22:38.830 --> 00:22:39.970
<v Speaker 2>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

530
00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:41.193
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've been very good partners </v>

531
00:22:43.481 --> 00:22:45.280
<v Speaker 2>creatively,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you just stand up special with them.</v>

532
00:22:45.820 --> 00:22:46.653
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did one special years ago for comedy </v>

533
00:22:48.821 --> 00:22:50.000
<v Speaker 2>central.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just did.</v>

534
00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:52.270
<v Speaker 2>You're just came out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How was,</v>

535
00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:53.920
<v Speaker 2>how was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how was the experience?</v>

536
00:22:53.980 --> 00:22:55.450
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what does the second one?</v>

537
00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:56.440
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've done three with them.</v>

538
00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:59.260
<v Speaker 2>I did one with them in 2005 a long time </v>
<v Speaker 2>ago.</v>

539
00:22:59.650 --> 00:23:03.290
<v Speaker 2>Way Back in the day and then I did one </v>
<v Speaker 2>two years ago in this.</v>

540
00:23:03.790 --> 00:23:06.160
<v Speaker 2>They're fucking amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't bother you at all?</v>

541
00:23:06.190 --> 00:23:07.450
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just leave you on.</v>

542
00:23:07.451 --> 00:23:08.290
<v Speaker 2>They go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're funny.</v>

543
00:23:08.570 --> 00:23:09.880
<v Speaker 2>You want to do a special.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

544
00:23:09.881 --> 00:23:10.714
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go ahead.</v>

545
00:23:10.810 --> 00:23:11.643
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's kind of the thing and they're </v>

546
00:23:12.071 --> 00:23:12.904
<v Speaker 2>just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've proven that you can do your </v>

547
00:23:14.021 --> 00:23:14.680
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

548
00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:16.510
<v Speaker 2>We're not going to get in the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think they realize like,</v>

549
00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:17.560
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't get in the way.</v>

550
00:23:17.561 --> 00:23:21.670
<v Speaker 2>We just have less work to do and if they</v>
<v Speaker 2>find someone like you,</v>

551
00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:24.330
<v Speaker 2>that is a funny guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just,</v>

552
00:23:24.370 --> 00:23:26.770
<v Speaker 2>they know you're going to try your best.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

553
00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:27.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you're funny.</v>

554
00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:30.970
<v Speaker 2>You're going to want to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Generally it's not a money grab.</v>

555
00:23:30.990 --> 00:23:32.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's like you want to go,</v>

556
00:23:32.710 --> 00:23:36.840
<v Speaker 2>you want to go fucking do it and do it </v>
<v Speaker 2>well and you know that everybody's gonna</v>

557
00:23:36.870 --> 00:23:37.703
<v Speaker 2>see it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing with them right now is </v>

558
00:23:39.371 --> 00:23:41.230
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know about you,</v>

559
00:23:41.231 --> 00:23:42.064
<v Speaker 2>but it's like I just want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I'm going to spend a lot of time </v>

560
00:23:44.831 --> 00:23:45.664
<v Speaker 2>making something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want the most amount of possible </v>

561
00:23:48.770 --> 00:23:52.070
<v Speaker 2>eyeballs that I can get and that's what </v>
<v Speaker 2>they do.</v>

562
00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:53.960
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially for a comedy special,</v>

563
00:23:54.260 --> 00:23:55.760
<v Speaker 2>there's really no other game in town.</v>

564
00:23:55.970 --> 00:23:56.803
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had friends that did something on </v>

565
00:23:57.951 --> 00:24:00.140
<v Speaker 2>Hbo and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

567
00:24:01.890 --> 00:24:05.930
<v Speaker 2>And if it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you don't see it that night,</v>

568
00:24:05.950 --> 00:24:07.820
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's some streaming services.</v>

569
00:24:07.821 --> 00:24:10.730
<v Speaker 2>I'm known as hbo go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I would love to see the numbers.</v>

570
00:24:10.910 --> 00:24:11.743
<v Speaker 2>I'd be cured.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Many people are actually using those </v>

571
00:24:13.041 --> 00:24:13.874
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would love to see the numbers across </v>

572
00:24:14.361 --> 00:24:15.740
<v Speaker 2>the board,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it is now.</v>

573
00:24:15.741 --> 00:24:17.750
<v Speaker 2>It just feels like we were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because we went out,</v>

574
00:24:17.810 --> 00:24:18.643
<v Speaker 2>we went out wide with the show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We had a couple of different offers and </v>

575
00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:25.580
<v Speaker 2>Netflix just seemed like the place where</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like they work at a creatively fuck</v>

576
00:24:25.581 --> 00:24:26.414
<v Speaker 2>with us and they were and everyone was </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to have a chance to see it and we </v>

<v Speaker 2>were going to get like kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we're going to get anyone,</v>

<v Speaker 2>and all that shit and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we should have a hormone monster.</v>

593
00:25:06.741 --> 00:25:07.574
<v Speaker 2>And then they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

594
00:25:07.610 --> 00:25:11.060
<v Speaker 2>it should just be a hormone monster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then Andrew called me.</v>

595
00:25:11.061 --> 00:25:11.894
<v Speaker 2>It was like we're thinking about doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>like a hormone monster and I just </v>

596
00:25:13.761 --> 00:25:15.510
<v Speaker 2>immediately was just like you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sylvia,</v>

00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:17.630
<v Speaker 2>Andrea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it just became.</v>

598
00:25:17.660 --> 00:25:18.201
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

<v Speaker 2>We got him fucking locked down and it </v>

601
00:25:22.881 --> 00:25:24.440
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we have those.</v>

602
00:25:24.441 --> 00:25:26.810
<v Speaker 2>We all have those things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

603
00:25:27.350 --> 00:25:29.330
<v Speaker 2>sometimes they get integrated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes they don't.</v>

604
00:25:29.450 --> 00:25:30.283
<v Speaker 2>Well it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just love that you just like what you </v>

605
00:25:33.351 --> 00:25:37.310
<v Speaker 2>see in south park and what you see in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>bill burroughs show F is for family,</v>

606
00:25:37.610 --> 00:25:38.420
<v Speaker 2>does things.</v>

607
00:25:38.420 --> 00:25:43.420
<v Speaker 2>You can do an animated show that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>physically impossible in any other form.</v>

608
00:25:43.970 --> 00:25:45.600
<v Speaker 2>And it's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

609
00:25:45.710 --> 00:25:49.630
<v Speaker 2>It's an amazing format especially for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think for us,</v>

610
00:25:49.631 --> 00:25:53.720
<v Speaker 2>like for if you're a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially if you're like a comedy brain</v>

611
00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:59.080
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't necessarily come straight </v>
<v Speaker 2>out of like classic Sitcom writing,</v>

612
00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:00.733
<v Speaker 2>that what you have other weird ways of </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting into something and you want to </v>

613
00:26:04.551 --> 00:26:07.400
<v Speaker 2>be able to personify it and like </v>
<v Speaker 2>animation just allows you to do it.</v>

614
00:26:07.401 --> 00:26:08.234
<v Speaker 2>It also allows you to fucking have a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you couldn't do live action stuff </v>

615
00:26:11.841 --> 00:26:14.390
<v Speaker 2>with the kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with kids the way we have where you just</v>

616
00:26:14.391 --> 00:26:16.760
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just too uncomfortable but.</v>

617
00:26:17.060 --> 00:26:19.000
<v Speaker 2>But you see it an animation and you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>get away,</v>

618
00:26:19.030 --> 00:26:19.401
<v Speaker 2>be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

619
00:26:19.401 --> 00:26:20.234
<v Speaker 2>let's have the statue of Liberty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>talk to that girl and let's have this </v>

620
00:26:21.681 --> 00:26:26.681
<v Speaker 2>hormone monster and this season it would</v>
<v Speaker 2>be unethical if you had children,</v>

621
00:26:26.691 --> 00:26:28.460
<v Speaker 2>actors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've ever worked with kid actors.</v>

622
00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:29.570
<v Speaker 2>You a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

623
00:26:29.590 --> 00:26:30.423
<v Speaker 2>I only did it once.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did a show called hardball and there </v>

624
00:26:32.901 --> 00:26:33.734
<v Speaker 2>was a little kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like a bat boy and the girl was </v>

625
00:26:35.601 --> 00:26:38.540
<v Speaker 2>on the show and they were both like </v>
<v Speaker 2>early teens,</v>

626
00:26:38.541 --> 00:26:40.790
<v Speaker 2>like 13,</v>
<v Speaker 2>14 and it was weird.</v>

627
00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:44.070
<v Speaker 2>I felt weird because everyone else's </v>
<v Speaker 2>adults</v>

628
00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:46.080
<v Speaker 1>and they would swear and say fucked up </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

629
00:26:46.081 --> 00:26:48.270
<v Speaker 1>You have to look over your shoulder so </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have the kids around.</v>

630
00:26:48.460 --> 00:26:49.770
<v Speaker 1>Can you say something crazy?</v>

631
00:26:49.990 --> 00:26:50.823
<v Speaker 3>I had to deal with a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was on the show called the league and </v>

632
00:26:53.081 --> 00:26:53.914

<v Speaker 3>but by the last seasons,</v>

634
00:26:59.101 --> 00:27:00.540

<v Speaker 3>eating ice chips out of a urinal,</v>

637
00:27:14.140 --> 00:27:16.310

<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>

672
00:28:21.131 --> 00:28:21.964
<v Speaker 1>That was the cutoff age.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the age where you could pull it </v>

673
00:28:24.041 --> 00:28:25.150
<v Speaker 1>off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>My favorite thing is not doing other </v>

716
00:30:00.521 --> 00:30:01.354
<v Speaker 2>comedians.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there's some weird kind of code </v>

<v Speaker 2>that I don't know what.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>And you know what I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you feel like a Dick?</v>

719
00:30:06.851 --> 00:30:08.950
<v Speaker 2>I try not to talk shit about comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just,</v>

720
00:30:08.951 --> 00:30:11.620
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why it's like I did it.</v>

721
00:30:11.650 --> 00:30:13.180
<v Speaker 2>It was one of my first gigs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>It was looking back.</v>

724
00:30:18.011 --> 00:30:21.220
<v Speaker 2>I would not probably do it now where you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

725
00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:22.360
<v Speaker 2>you just do it over the top.</v>

726
00:30:22.860 --> 00:30:25.080
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just didn't know what I mean.</v>

727
00:30:25.090 --> 00:30:27.340
<v Speaker 2>Isn't andy kind of over the top as easy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

728
00:30:27.341 --> 00:30:28.000
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I did not mean it was not been like I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to go fucking get Andy Dick.</v>

730
00:30:31.481 --> 00:30:33.790
<v Speaker 2>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I saw him,</v>

731
00:30:33.910 --> 00:30:34.743
<v Speaker 2>when I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Since then I've seen him over the years </v>

732
00:30:36.290 --> 00:30:38.290
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I liked him and I think he,</v>

733
00:30:39.130 --> 00:30:40.960
<v Speaker 2>when he's sober,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>

00:30:41.500 --> 00:30:42.333
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw your impression of me and he's </v>

735
00:30:44.291 --> 00:30:46.180
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>it's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

737
00:30:47.260 --> 00:30:51.400

740
00:30:58.810 --> 00:31:00.070

<v Speaker 3>I feel like we're in A.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like I have a gold fish brain.</v>

813
00:34:06.190 --> 00:34:10.330
<v Speaker 3>Like I feel like I just like swim and </v>
<v Speaker 3>five minutes later it's gone.</v>

814
00:34:10.550 --> 00:34:11.383
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I feel like I am constantly in that </v>

815
00:34:13.901 --> 00:34:18.850
<v Speaker 3>space and I feel like we record all this</v>
<v Speaker 3>shit and then we don't really look back.</v>

816
00:34:18.851 --> 00:34:20.980
<v Speaker 3>Maybe some people look back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm the same way.</v>

817
00:34:21.160 --> 00:34:23.160
<v Speaker 3>I think we're inundated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're over</v>

818
00:34:23.220 --> 00:34:24.053
<v Speaker 1>run by information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think our brains are even </v>

819
00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:31.160
<v Speaker 1>remotely capable of processing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of raw data that comes to you and</v>

820
00:34:31.460 --> 00:34:32.293
<v Speaker 1>have you checked your google news feed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you check your twitter feed and </v>

821
00:34:35.761 --> 00:34:39.570
<v Speaker 1>then people send me things in email and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I check those out.</v>

822
00:34:39.571 --> 00:34:40.470
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have,</v>

823
00:34:40.770 --> 00:34:43.590
<v Speaker 1>I don't have the time or the storage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

824
00:34:43.620 --> 00:34:44.850
<v Speaker 1>it goes in and it goes out.</v>

825
00:34:45.290 --> 00:34:46.123
<v Speaker 3>I have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well I have,</v>

826
00:34:46.170 --> 00:34:49.360
<v Speaker 3>I just was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I use the Google App on my phone to like</v>

827
00:34:49.370 --> 00:34:50.050
<v Speaker 3>search it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

828
00:34:50.050 --> 00:34:51.350
<v Speaker 3>me too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'll go on there,</v>

829
00:34:51.351 --> 00:34:52.184
<v Speaker 3>but now Google's got like stories they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it thinks I'm going to be interested in </v>

830
00:34:55.430 --> 00:34:56.840
<v Speaker 3>and then I'll be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh fuck,</v>

831
00:34:56.841 --> 00:34:58.910
<v Speaker 3>I guess I gotta look up whatever's going</v>
<v Speaker 3>on.</v>

832
00:34:58.940 --> 00:35:02.630
<v Speaker 3>And then like 30 minutes later I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why did I go to Google?</v>

833
00:35:02.660 --> 00:35:04.300
<v Speaker 3>What was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what was I going in there for?</v>

834
00:35:04.370 --> 00:35:05.750
<v Speaker 3>That's my toilet time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

835
00:35:05.751 --> 00:35:06.584
<v Speaker 3>I'm taking a dump.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Open that APP up and next thing you </v>

836
00:35:08.261 --> 00:35:09.170
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my legs are numb.</v>

837
00:35:09.620 --> 00:35:10.453
<v Speaker 3>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're like limping out of the bathroom </v>

838
00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:16.910
<v Speaker 3>with a weird red emperor in impressions </v>
<v Speaker 3>on like right above your knee.</v>

839
00:35:16.970 --> 00:35:17.803
<v Speaker 1>And it doesn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like I didn't get anything out of </v>

840
00:35:20.031 --> 00:35:23.060
<v Speaker 1>that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like if you have discipline,</v>

841
00:35:23.061 --> 00:35:25.820
<v Speaker 1>if you could avoid that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the good stories will come to you.</v>

842
00:35:26.270 --> 00:35:27.920
<v Speaker 1>The ones that you need to hear about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

843
00:35:27.921 --> 00:35:29.900
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you fucking heard about what happened</v>

844
00:35:29.901 --> 00:35:30.621
<v Speaker 1>to him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

845
00:35:30.621 --> 00:35:31.454
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you hear it.</v>

846
00:35:31.620 --> 00:35:33.810
<v Speaker 3>Yes it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or because I also,</v>

847
00:35:33.811 --> 00:35:35.120
<v Speaker 3>there was a period of time where I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

848
00:35:35.490 --> 00:35:38.880
<v Speaker 3>not reading the news.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was parsing,</v>

849
00:35:39.060 --> 00:35:42.450
<v Speaker 3>I was piecing together the news based </v>
<v Speaker 3>off of people's twitter jokes,</v>

850
00:35:43.580 --> 00:35:44.760
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where I was like,</v>

851
00:35:45.180 --> 00:35:46.920
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to put the math together.</v>

852
00:35:46.921 --> 00:35:48.270
<v Speaker 3>I think like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

853
00:35:48.340 --> 00:35:50.340
<v Speaker 3>I think there's been a hurricane </v>
<v Speaker 3>somewhere.</v>

854
00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:54.390
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I feel like my downtime,</v>

855
00:35:54.780 --> 00:35:55.560
<v Speaker 3>my pro,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

856
00:35:55.560 --> 00:35:56.393
<v Speaker 3>I think I'm scared of having actual </v>
<v Speaker 3>downtime because when I have actual </v>

857
00:36:00.511 --> 00:36:04.500
<v Speaker 3>downtime I spent so much time in some of</v>
<v Speaker 3>my phone that.</v>

858
00:36:04.830 --> 00:36:08.340
<v Speaker 3>And that stresses me out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like if I'm working,</v>

859
00:36:08.341 --> 00:36:11.610
<v Speaker 3>I don't have time to be looking at my </v>
<v Speaker 3>phone and then I'm like,</v>

860
00:36:11.620 --> 00:36:13.260
<v Speaker 3>just work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

861
00:36:13.261 --> 00:36:16.680
<v Speaker 3>But it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm scared of like downtime.</v>

862
00:36:17.190 --> 00:36:18.300
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Downtime,</v>

863
00:36:18.550 --> 00:36:20.560
<v Speaker 4>fallen time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they are very bad for you.</v>

864
00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:23.830
<v Speaker 4>It's just not healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not normal,</v>

865
00:36:23.831 --> 00:36:24.664
<v Speaker 4>it's not a normal interaction.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if you're like looking at shit that </v>

866
00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:31.010
<v Speaker 4>you're freaking out about that as I was </v>
<v Speaker 4>freaking out today about um,</v>

867
00:36:31.270 --> 00:36:32.920
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's going on in Portland,</v>

868

<v Speaker 4>happening and they're blocking traffic </v>

869
00:36:38.210 --> 00:36:39.043
<v Speaker 4>and people are trying to drive to their </v>
<v Speaker 4>job and the Antifa people are telling </v>

870
00:36:41.531 --> 00:36:44.080
<v Speaker 4>them go right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're closed the street off and they got</v>

871
00:36:44.081 --> 00:36:44.914
<v Speaker 4>like masks on Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the Portland mayor apparently not </v>

872

<v Speaker 4>doing anything about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And their stress smash some banging on </v>

<v Speaker 4>on to alert the health department.</v>

<v Speaker 2>arts career.</v>

957
00:40:33.530 --> 00:40:35.020
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that can be a problem.</v>

958
00:40:35.350 --> 00:40:38.080
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever fought so hard that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>like lose like mayor?</v>

959
00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:39.950
<v Speaker 2>Does that happen?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like with Michelle?</v>

960
00:40:40.170 --> 00:40:41.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like marathon.</v>

961
00:40:41.081 --> 00:40:43.060
<v Speaker 2>I've done that inside the octagon for </v>
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

962
00:40:43.270 --> 00:40:44.103
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's actually a new rule in some </v>

963
00:40:45.581 --> 00:40:46.414
<v Speaker 2>athletic commissions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They stop a fight just for hygiene </v>

964
00:40:49.781 --> 00:40:51.940
<v Speaker 2>concerns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone shits themselves.</v>

965
00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:53.740
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's happened many times.</v>

966
00:40:54.040 --> 00:40:54.873
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you think if you've got an open </v>

967
00:40:55.601 --> 00:40:58.630
<v Speaker 2>wound and you got shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's some real issues.</v>

968
00:40:58.900 --> 00:41:01.870
<v Speaker 2>There's some real duty duty issues </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

969
00:41:01.890 --> 00:41:02.723
<v Speaker 2>Real problem and there was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was that marathon runner who lost </v>

970
00:41:05.950 --> 00:41:08.590
<v Speaker 2>her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that's happened a bunch of times.</v>

971
00:41:08.591 --> 00:41:11.410
<v Speaker 2>Apparently marathon runners shit </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves all the time.</v>

972
00:41:11.411 --> 00:41:14.500
<v Speaker 2>Just keep running.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see I'm not that.</v>

973
00:41:14.590 --> 00:41:16.520
<v Speaker 2>Are you that way?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isn't it like you'll push your leg?</v>

974
00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:17.393
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would never push myself to that point </v>

975
00:41:18.821 --> 00:41:19.421
<v Speaker 2>where I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

976
00:41:19.421 --> 00:41:20.254
<v Speaker 2>I'll push myself to the phone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really depends on what it meant to me </v>

977
00:41:22.700 --> 00:41:23.533
<v Speaker 2>and I mean if I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I had some deep emotional reason to </v>

978
00:41:27.521 --> 00:41:29.030
<v Speaker 2>finish this marathon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

979
00:41:29.100 --> 00:41:32.050
<v Speaker 2>Like my dad died or you know what I </v>
<v Speaker 2>mean?</v>

980
00:41:33.810 --> 00:41:34.240

<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

982
00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:38.420

<v Speaker 1>His Dad did.</v>

983
00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:39.753
<v Speaker 1>His Dad ran a marathon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His Dad is a holocaust survivor in his </v>

984
00:41:42.410 --> 00:41:45.170
<v Speaker 1>eighties and he ran a six hour marathon </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the.</v>

985
00:41:45.450 --> 00:41:46.283
<v Speaker 1>We were telling Bert,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no fucking way you got to beat </v>

986
00:41:47.541 --> 00:41:50.450
<v Speaker 1>or his dad or his dad said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's 80.</v>

987
00:41:50.890 --> 00:41:51.651
<v Speaker 1>Bert,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a fat.</v>

988
00:41:51.651 --> 00:41:54.010
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did he beat him by like a half hour?</v>

989
00:41:54.020 --> 00:41:57.920
<v Speaker 1>Burt did it in like five hours on birth </v>
<v Speaker 1>or his dad was like seventies,</v>

990
00:41:57.921 --> 00:41:59.330

<v Speaker 1>You can survive the Holocaust man.</v>

993
00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:05.810
<v Speaker 1>What's a fucking marathon?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

994
00:42:05.930 --> 00:42:07.850
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was also in the Israeli army.</v>

995
00:42:07.860 --> 00:42:10.220
<v Speaker 1>He's an old dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

996
00:42:10.221 --> 00:42:10.760
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

997
00:42:10.760 --> 00:42:12.050
<v Speaker 1>but you look at our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

998
00:42:12.051 --> 00:42:13.550
<v Speaker 1>I could see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's that.</v>

999
00:42:13.580 --> 00:42:17.450
<v Speaker 1>There's that version of Jus like that </v>
<v Speaker 1>skinny Jew that can run a marathon,</v>

1000
00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:18.350
<v Speaker 1>like I buy that.</v>

1001
00:42:18.530 --> 00:42:21.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could see that.</v>

1002
00:42:21.380 --> 00:42:23.570
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we started doing this fitness thing</v>

1003
00:42:23.571 --> 00:42:24.570
<v Speaker 1>already had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1004
00:42:24.590 --> 00:42:25.423
<v Speaker 1>we have the sober October thing and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this fitness challenge attached </v>

1005
00:42:27.621 --> 00:42:28.454
<v Speaker 1>to it and our.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He literally hadn't worked out at all </v>

1006
00:42:31.340 --> 00:42:33.530
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he said 10 years.</v>

1007
00:42:33.980 --> 00:42:36.860
<v Speaker 1>I think 10 years ago he was taking </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu with me.</v>

1008
00:42:37.190 --> 00:42:40.220
<v Speaker 1>That's the last time he did any exercise</v>
<v Speaker 1>at all.</v>

1009
00:42:40.460 --> 00:42:41.600
<v Speaker 1>How did he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how is he doing?</v>

1010
00:42:41.601 --> 00:42:43.580
<v Speaker 1>He's doing great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's in second place right now.</v>

1011
00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:46.730
<v Speaker 1>He's right behind me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is a game of genetics on some level.</v>

1012
00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:48.420
<v Speaker 1>It's just a game of will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1013
00:42:48.590 --> 00:42:49.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because this thing,</v>

1014
00:42:49.521 --> 00:42:52.460
<v Speaker 1>this thing that we're using,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all it does is measure your heart rate,</v>

1015
00:42:52.670 --> 00:42:56.780
<v Speaker 1>so if you're just willing to keep your </v>
<v Speaker 1>heart rate elevated and push yourself,</v>

1016
00:42:57.080 --> 00:42:57.920
<v Speaker 1>it just depends on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1017
00:42:57.921 --> 00:42:58.754
<v Speaker 1>Like what is your level of competition?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're like that you want to </v>

1018
00:43:00.981 --> 00:43:01.580
<v Speaker 1>fucking.</v>

1019
00:43:01.580 --> 00:43:03.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what is your.</v>

1020
00:43:03.590 --> 00:43:05.870
<v Speaker 1>How strong is your will?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's really what it is.</v>

1021
00:43:05.930 --> 00:43:06.763
<v Speaker 1>Is there anything to it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's like if you have an exercise in </v>

1022
00:43:08.331 --> 00:43:10.610
<v Speaker 1>10 years and you all of a sudden start </v>
<v Speaker 1>to exercise,</v>

1023
00:43:10.611 --> 00:43:12.770
<v Speaker 1>your heart rate goes up naturally </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's like,</v>

1024
00:43:12.771 --> 00:43:15.680
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're trying to think that maybe he's so</v>

1025
00:43:15.681 --> 00:43:19.220
<v Speaker 1>fucking out of shape that he's just like</v>
<v Speaker 1>walking and his heart rate's been,</v>

1026
00:43:21.170 --> 00:43:24.590
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But see this thing is very flawed.</v>

1027
00:43:24.620 --> 00:43:25.453
<v Speaker 1>This fucking this thing that we have </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it gives you the same amount of </v>

1028
00:43:28.671 --> 00:43:32.300
<v Speaker 1>points for 80 percent of your heart rate</v>
<v Speaker 1>as it does for 90.</v>

1029
00:43:32.790 --> 00:43:33.623
<v Speaker 1>So the first day I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna burry these motherfuckers and </v>

1030
00:43:36.610 --> 00:43:39.290
<v Speaker 1>I pegged my heart rate at 90 for like 35</v>
<v Speaker 1>minutes.</v>

1031
00:43:39.500 --> 00:43:40.940
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to leave them in the dust</v>

1032
00:43:41.070 --> 00:43:42.260
<v Speaker 1>like they can't keep up.</v>

1033
00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:45.110
<v Speaker 1>And then I found out that all you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>to just keep it at 80,</v>

1034
00:43:45.111 --> 00:43:47.990
<v Speaker 1>which was like 143 beats per minute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is easy.</v>

1035
00:43:48.340 --> 00:43:52.100
<v Speaker 1>You walk and talk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll get the 43 if you.</v>

1036
00:43:52.280 --> 00:43:55.160
<v Speaker 1>If you're on an elliptical machine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could have a full on conversation.</v>

1037
00:43:55.161 --> 00:43:57.530
<v Speaker 1>No problem at 143 beats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1038
00:43:57.950 --> 00:44:00.350
<v Speaker 1>So it's flawed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's flawed because the end,</v>

1039
00:44:00.351 --> 00:44:02.690
<v Speaker 1>there's that difference between 80 and </v>
<v Speaker 1>90 percent where you're like,</v>

1040
00:44:02.691 --> 00:44:03.524
<v Speaker 1>you're getting that extra burden.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the matter of the sheer time you </v>

1041
00:44:07.311 --> 00:44:08.190
<v Speaker 1>put in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

1042
00:44:08.280 --> 00:44:12.500
<v Speaker 1>that's what's separating everybody in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this little challenge at Ari.</v>

1043
00:44:12.501 --> 00:44:17.120
<v Speaker 1>We'll put in two and a half hours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he will watch a movie and just keep</v>

1044
00:44:17.121 --> 00:44:21.830
<v Speaker 1>his heart rate pegged at 100 4,346</v>
<v Speaker 1>beats a minute for two and a half hours.</v>

1045
00:44:21.831 --> 00:44:22.664
<v Speaker 1>He wants to fucking beat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You guys just wants a win and he wants </v>

1046
00:44:24.501 --> 00:44:27.290
<v Speaker 1>and he's been talking mad shit about it.</v>

1047
00:44:27.480 --> 00:44:28.313
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

1048
00:44:28.320 --> 00:44:29.570
<v Speaker 1>I was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At first I was like,</v>

1049
00:44:29.571 --> 00:44:33.060
<v Speaker 1>you know what the context is so fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no real.</v>

1050
00:44:33.540 --> 00:44:34.373
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's nothing we haven't </v>

1051
00:44:35.610 --> 00:44:37.680
<v Speaker 1>established.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happens to the loser,</v>

1052
00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:38.993
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we haven't established what the winner </v>

1053
00:44:39.871 --> 00:44:41.530
<v Speaker 1>gets other than a belt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have a belt,</v>

1054
00:44:41.980 --> 00:44:46.740
<v Speaker 1>her belt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a wwe bill getting one made.</v>

1055
00:44:47.540 --> 00:44:48.930
<v Speaker 1>That's so funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's just,</v>

1056
00:44:48.931 --> 00:44:49.764
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's all just wanting to beat your </v>

1057
00:44:50.461 --> 00:44:51.294
<v Speaker 1>friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1058
00:44:51.420 --> 00:44:52.980
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and for awhile I was like,</v>

1059
00:44:52.981 --> 00:44:53.814
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to do my normal workout </v>

1060
00:44:54.521 --> 00:44:56.890
<v Speaker 1>and if they beat me they beat me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I thought about,</v>

1061
00:44:56.940 --> 00:44:58.260
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't let that happen.</v>

1062
00:44:59.040 --> 00:44:59.873
<v Speaker 1>So I started ramping it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I decided over the last couple of days </v>

1063
00:45:02.530 --> 00:45:03.363
<v Speaker 1>that it took three days off too because </v>
<v Speaker 1>I had to go to vegas and I had to work </v>

1064
00:45:06.090 --> 00:45:07.250
<v Speaker 1>and then I decided,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1065
00:45:07.290 --> 00:45:09.210
<v Speaker 1>yesterday I'm going to fuck these guys </v>
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

1066
00:45:09.211 --> 00:45:11.520
<v Speaker 1>So yesterday and today I've been hitting</v>
<v Speaker 1>it hard.</v>

1067
00:45:11.820 --> 00:45:14.670
<v Speaker 1>I did three and a half hours today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1068
00:45:14.730 --> 00:45:17.010
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you feel good?</v>

1069
00:45:17.310 --> 00:45:18.143
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1070
00:45:18.360 --> 00:45:18.691
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1071
00:45:18.691 --> 00:45:20.640
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And physically do you feel different?</v>

1072
00:45:20.641 --> 00:45:22.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you do or do not feel different?</v>

1073
00:45:22.561 --> 00:45:23.310
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1074
00:45:23.310 --> 00:45:25.780
<v Speaker 1>being completely sober?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

<v Speaker 1>all this running.</v>

1076
00:45:28.810 --> 00:45:30.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no doubt about that.</v>

1077
00:45:30.510 --> 00:45:33.000
<v Speaker 1>That's real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like runner's high is legit.</v>

1078
00:45:33.360 --> 00:45:37.650
<v Speaker 1>Like if you run for two hours and then a</v>
<v Speaker 1>rock falls in your car from the sky.</v>

1079
00:45:37.651 --> 00:45:39.270
<v Speaker 1>But I guess I lost my car.</v>

1080
00:45:42.550 --> 00:45:44.160
<v Speaker 1>So silly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a.</v>

1081
00:45:44.161 --> 00:45:46.050
<v Speaker 1>and I get the same way from Yoga.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1082
00:45:46.170 --> 00:45:48.420
<v Speaker 1>Silly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a silliness to you.</v>

1083
00:45:48.600 --> 00:45:49.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

1084
00:45:49.840 --> 00:45:52.260
<v Speaker 1>I hate running so much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I fucking hate it.</v>

1085
00:45:52.560 --> 00:45:54.520
<v Speaker 1>I'd rather go like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1086
00:45:54.570 --> 00:45:57.030
<v Speaker 1>I started playing soccer again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Soccer's great.</v>

1087

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's intense.</v>

1089
00:46:00.541 --> 00:46:01.374
<v Speaker 1>Like I finished that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My problem is I turned bright red as </v>

1090
00:46:03.091 --> 00:46:06.300
<v Speaker 1>soon as I do anything with any.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like the color,</v>

1091
00:46:06.301 --> 00:46:08.940
<v Speaker 1>like a deep maroon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

1092
00:46:09.140 --> 00:46:10.770
<v Speaker 1>but it's great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I need,</v>

1093
00:46:11.010 --> 00:46:13.530
<v Speaker 1>I need a game attached to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't just run.</v>

1094
00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:16.590
<v Speaker 1>That's why Jujitsu is so good for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I love about you.</v>

1095
00:46:16.591 --> 00:46:18.930
<v Speaker 1>Just so you're doing something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to,</v>

1096
00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:19.793
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing a martial art and it's </v>

1097
00:46:21.661 --> 00:46:25.740
<v Speaker 1>exhausting and you get a great workout </v>
<v Speaker 1>in while you're having fun.</v>

1098
00:46:26.370 --> 00:46:28.200
<v Speaker 1>Beating the shit out of somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Choking people.</v>

1099
00:46:28.760 --> 00:46:29.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1100
00:46:29.250 --> 00:46:30.083
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never mind.</v>

1101
00:46:30.640 --> 00:46:31.473
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll go play soccer and then slightly </v>

1102
00:46:32.731 --> 00:46:34.320
<v Speaker 1>injured myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm like,</v>

1103
00:46:34.321 --> 00:46:36.420
<v Speaker 1>as I'm getting older,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like every time I do it,</v>

1104
00:46:36.421 --> 00:46:38.760
<v Speaker 1>I do something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck up my body.</v>

1105
00:46:38.761 --> 00:46:39.990
<v Speaker 1>He definitely can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1106
00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:41.370
<v Speaker 1>we have here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>

1107
00:46:41.371 --> 00:46:42.204
<v Speaker 1>We have this htc vive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a virtual reality headset and </v>

1108
00:46:45.121 --> 00:46:50.121
<v Speaker 1>there's a boxing game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Put this headset on and you're standing,</v>

1109
00:46:50.131 --> 00:46:52.640
<v Speaker 1>you see boxing gloves in front of you </v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's a dude in front of you,</v>

1110
00:46:52.641 --> 00:46:53.790
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks really good.</v>

1111
00:46:54.210 --> 00:46:57.540
<v Speaker 1>Throw punches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you get that aerobic workout without</v>

1112
00:46:58.210 --> 00:47:01.230
<v Speaker 1>pounding her fucking and he hits you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see sparks.</v>

1113
00:47:01.470 --> 00:47:02.310
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Boom.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1115
00:47:03.631 --> 00:47:06.420
<v Speaker 1>You don't feel anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it makes you nervous.</v>

1116
00:47:06.421 --> 00:47:06.841
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>damn,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1118
00:47:08.040 --> 00:47:10.670
<v Speaker 1>like I've done rounds where you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've,</v>

1119
00:47:10.700 --> 00:47:12.600
<v Speaker 1>you fight these people and you get </v>
<v Speaker 1>exhausted.</v>

1120
00:47:12.760 --> 00:47:14.190
<v Speaker 1>Boxing seems to be crazy.</v>

1121
00:47:14.290 --> 00:47:15.480
<v Speaker 1>Aerobic workout.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's great.</v>

1122
00:47:15.481 --> 00:47:17.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's getting hit in the head thing.</v>

1123
00:47:17.670 --> 00:47:20.700
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking terrible for you though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so bad for you.</v>

1124
00:47:20.940 --> 00:47:21.773
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1125
00:47:21.810 --> 00:47:23.340
<v Speaker 1>I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never been.</v>

1126
00:47:23.341 --> 00:47:24.174
<v Speaker 1>I've been so averse to that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was talking to Louis about that </v>

1127
00:47:26.131 --> 00:47:28.170
<v Speaker 1>because he was boxing for a while and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>

1128
00:47:28.171 --> 00:47:30.010
<v Speaker 1>I love sparring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're sparring.</v>

1129
00:47:30.310 --> 00:47:31.090
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1130
00:47:31.090 --> 00:47:32.290
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how often do you sparring?</v>

1131
00:47:32.560 --> 00:47:34.000
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you sparring quite a bit.</v>

1132
00:47:34.001 --> 00:47:35.410
<v Speaker 1>I could do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

1133
00:47:35.560 --> 00:47:36.393
<v Speaker 1>I know you're having a good time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you have to understand like there </v>

1134
00:47:39.320 --> 00:47:40.153
<v Speaker 1>there's real consequences to this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're getting in car accidents </v>

1135
00:47:42.341 --> 00:47:43.750
<v Speaker 1>constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're getting hit.</v>

1136
00:47:43.900 --> 00:47:44.733
<v Speaker 1>You're getting hit in the head like that</v>
<v Speaker 1>counts and you're doing it when you're </v>

1137
00:47:48.071 --> 00:47:48.904
<v Speaker 1>48 years old like this and you're fat </v>
<v Speaker 1>like so you're not moving a lot and </v>

1138
00:47:53.140 --> 00:47:53.973
<v Speaker 1>don't got great headbutts and like your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your muscles aren't there to like take </v>

1139
00:47:57.221 --> 00:47:59.740
<v Speaker 1>whatever that there's real consequences </v>
<v Speaker 1>to getting here.</v>

1140
00:47:59.850 --> 00:48:01.660
<v Speaker 1>How often do you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't do that at all.</v>

1141
00:48:01.661 --> 00:48:02.860
<v Speaker 1>You'll never get hit in the head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1142
00:48:02.861 --> 00:48:03.970
<v Speaker 1>I don't do it at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1143
00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:05.560
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I stopped doing it a long time ago.</v>

1144
00:48:06.060 --> 00:48:07.720
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hit the bag.</v>

1145
00:48:07.721 --> 00:48:08.554
<v Speaker 1>I'll hit pads and I would spar with </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who I know well where I won't </v>

1146
00:48:12.221 --> 00:48:14.350
<v Speaker 1>hit them and they won't touch each </v>
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>

1147
00:48:14.351 --> 00:48:15.940
<v Speaker 1>It'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what about you?</v>

1148
00:48:15.941 --> 00:48:17.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about all these different?</v>

1149
00:48:17.561 --> 00:48:19.980
<v Speaker 1>Because it's just choking on bars and </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff like that.</v>

1150
00:48:20.350 --> 00:48:22.150
<v Speaker 1>There's no like there's no hitting each </v>
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>

1151
00:48:22.310 --> 00:48:26.500
<v Speaker 1>Know that hitting in the head is fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fun.</v>

1152
00:48:26.501 --> 00:48:28.690
<v Speaker 1>It's fun to hit people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fun to not get hit.</v>

1153
00:48:28.960 --> 00:48:31.120
<v Speaker 1>It feels good to take a shot and give </v>
<v Speaker 1>one back,</v>

1154
00:48:31.330 --> 00:48:35.290
<v Speaker 1>but the consequences are real and I see </v>
<v Speaker 1>too much of it.</v>

1155
00:48:35.291 --> 00:48:36.124
<v Speaker 1>I see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see this slow degrading of your </v>

1156
00:48:40.301 --> 00:48:41.550
<v Speaker 1>cognitive ability.</v>

1157
00:48:41.580 --> 00:48:43.810
<v Speaker 1>I've seen it in too many people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think?</v>

1158
00:48:43.870 --> 00:48:47.130
<v Speaker 1>What do you think anything's going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen with football like you think it's</v>

1159
00:48:47.410 --> 00:48:48.243
<v Speaker 1>are they going to like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think people are going to wise up and </v>

1160
00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:51.833
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think fighting is way better for you </v>

1161
00:48:53.200 --> 00:48:55.510
<v Speaker 1>than football and I think fighting is </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible for you.</v>

1162
00:48:55.930 --> 00:48:56.763
<v Speaker 1>I think football is the worst because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're running at each other full clip </v>

1163
00:48:59.650 --> 00:49:04.480
<v Speaker 1>and slamming into each other all day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like driving off a cliff constantly</v>

1164
00:49:04.690 --> 00:49:07.360
<v Speaker 1>over and over and over again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking nuts.</v>

1165
00:49:07.390 --> 00:49:08.223
<v Speaker 1>We have a friend and they have a kid </v>
<v Speaker 1>who's in high school who has severe </v>

1166
00:49:12.461 --> 00:49:13.294
<v Speaker 1>depression from getting football.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's all fucked up from football and </v>

1167
00:49:17.591 --> 00:49:19.630
<v Speaker 1>they can't believe that it happened so </v>
<v Speaker 1>fast.</v>

1168
00:49:19.631 --> 00:49:21.480
<v Speaker 1>I would go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How long has he been playing?</v>

1169
00:49:21.810 --> 00:49:22.643
<v Speaker 1>Playing for a couple years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's been getting smashed in the head </v>

1170
00:49:25.061 --> 00:49:28.600
<v Speaker 1>for years because it's just like you and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you watch like a football practice.</v>

1171
00:49:28.600 --> 00:49:32.110
<v Speaker 1>Those students are just like listening </v>
<v Speaker 1>and less and less,</v>

1172
00:49:32.111 --> 00:49:33.850
<v Speaker 1>and now I think they're finally </v>
<v Speaker 1>realizing,</v>

1173
00:49:33.851 --> 00:49:36.340
<v Speaker 1>but like when we were growing up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all my buddies played football.</v>

1174
00:49:36.341 --> 00:49:37.174
<v Speaker 1>Like every drill was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stand in a circle and let's have these </v>

1175
00:49:39.941 --> 00:49:43.270
<v Speaker 1>dudes fucking run into each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Speed over and over.</v>

1176
00:49:43.271 --> 00:49:44.104
<v Speaker 1>Finding out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now they're getting hit in the body is </v>

1177
00:49:46.720 --> 00:49:48.970
<v Speaker 1>as bad as getting hit in the head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

1178
00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:49.833
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because when you get slammed in the </v>

1179
00:49:51.131 --> 00:49:54.040
<v Speaker 1>body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your head snaps back and your brain goes</v>

1180
00:49:54.041 --> 00:49:54.791
<v Speaker 1>whoosh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoosh.</v>

1181
00:49:54.791 --> 00:49:57.190
<v Speaker 1>Inside your skull.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it,</v>

1182
00:49:57.280 --> 00:50:01.300
<v Speaker 1>you think that concussions only come </v>
<v Speaker 1>from getting a head injury.</v>

1183
00:50:01.380 --> 00:50:02.213
<v Speaker 1>It's not the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're finding the people get </v>

1184
00:50:03.940 --> 00:50:06.010
<v Speaker 1>concussions from getting hit in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>body.</v>

1185
00:50:06.250 --> 00:50:08.890
<v Speaker 1>So this is pure ignorance in boxing or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

1186
00:50:08.891 --> 00:50:10.930
<v Speaker 1>When a guy gets knocked out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's getting,</v>

1187
00:50:10.960 --> 00:50:11.980
<v Speaker 1>that's a concussion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1188
00:50:12.010 --> 00:50:13.120
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of the time,</v>

1189
00:50:13.160 --> 00:50:14.000
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1190
00:50:14.300 --> 00:50:15.133
<v Speaker 1>And so those guys are just getting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're getting concussions all the </v>

1191
00:50:16.811 --> 00:50:17.690
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1192
00:50:18.190 --> 00:50:20.740
<v Speaker 1>And they get concussions even when they </v>
<v Speaker 1>win sometimes.</v>

1193
00:50:20.950 --> 00:50:21.783
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1194
00:50:22.030 --> 00:50:24.580
<v Speaker 1>there's a guy named Joe Valtellina who's</v>
<v Speaker 1>been on the show before.</v>

1195
00:50:24.581 --> 00:50:28.250
<v Speaker 1>He's a world championship kickboxer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had to retire after he won</v>

1196
00:50:28.250 --> 00:50:32.390
<v Speaker 4>the title.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He won the fight and then afterwards his</v>

1197
00:50:32.630 --> 00:50:37.490
<v Speaker 4>head injury was so severe he couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>look at the light from a charger,</v>

1198
00:50:37.550 --> 00:50:38.480
<v Speaker 4>from a phone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1199
00:50:38.490 --> 00:50:39.323
<v Speaker 4>like a phone charger.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He had to be in total darkness for </v>

1200
00:50:41.241 --> 00:50:43.400
<v Speaker 4>months at a time or for weeks at a time </v>
<v Speaker 4>rather.</v>

1201
00:50:43.780 --> 00:50:47.180
<v Speaker 4>And what saved him was actually CBD oil.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>

1202
00:50:47.181 --> 00:50:48.014
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cbd Oil is pretty good at reducing </v>

1203
00:50:50.121 --> 00:50:50.954
<v Speaker 4>inflammation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's pretty radical and its effect and </v>

1204
00:50:53.121 --> 00:50:55.310
<v Speaker 4>that that brought it all down for them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I haven't.</v>

1205
00:50:55.640 --> 00:50:58.010
<v Speaker 3>I haven't tried cbd oil very much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1206
00:50:58.130 --> 00:51:00.170
<v Speaker 3>it's really good for pain and stuff like</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1207
00:51:00.171 --> 00:51:00.670
<v Speaker 3>It's great</v>

1208
00:51:00.670 --> 00:51:01.503
<v Speaker 4>pain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's great for anxiety and one of the </v>

1209
00:51:02.951 --> 00:51:05.560
<v Speaker 4>more important things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't fuck with you.</v>

1210
00:51:05.820 --> 00:51:07.920
<v Speaker 4>Like cognitively.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1211
00:51:07.921 --> 00:51:09.500
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't make you high.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not right.</v>

1212
00:51:09.880 --> 00:51:14.080
<v Speaker 4>So you can do it and just go do stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it alleviates anxiety.</v>

1213
00:51:14.110 --> 00:51:14.943
<v Speaker 4>Calms you down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Where do they think that maybe some </v>

1214
00:51:17.231 --> 00:51:21.100
<v Speaker 4>anxiety may coincide with inflammation?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1215
00:51:21.101 --> 00:51:23.290
<v Speaker 4>that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like physical inflammation,</v>

1216
00:51:23.291 --> 00:51:25.420
<v Speaker 4>that it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It makes sense.</v>

1217
00:51:25.450 --> 00:51:26.430
<v Speaker 4>Oil,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1218
00:51:26.440 --> 00:51:28.030
<v Speaker 4>drops,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oil drops.</v>

1219
00:51:28.031 --> 00:51:31.900
<v Speaker 4>It's also good for just your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just your overall,</v>

1220
00:51:31.930 --> 00:51:34.930
<v Speaker 4>your whole system,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your gut biome.</v>

1221
00:51:34.931 --> 00:51:35.690
<v Speaker 4>It's good for everything.</v>

1222
00:51:35.690 --> 00:51:38.450
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've just been smoking weed forever.</v>

1223
00:51:38.750 --> 00:51:40.190
<v Speaker 3>That's good too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That helps.</v>

1224
00:51:40.640 --> 00:51:44.870
<v Speaker 3>I went to a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went to burning man this year and uh,</v>

1225
00:51:45.520 --> 00:51:48.920
<v Speaker 3>did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>had just a fucking wild time of,</v>

1226
00:51:49.100 --> 00:51:52.250
<v Speaker 3>because I know you've talked about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd never done acid before.</v>

1227
00:51:53.090 --> 00:51:55.130
<v Speaker 3>I did ask him for the first time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How was it?</v>

1228
00:51:55.430 --> 00:51:57.560
<v Speaker 3>It was fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've done,</v>

1229
00:51:57.561 --> 00:52:02.090
<v Speaker 3>I've done mushrooms like somewhat </v>
<v Speaker 3>regularly for most of my adult life,</v>

1230
00:52:02.120 --> 00:52:03.890
<v Speaker 3>like not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not crazy amounts but like,</v>

1231
00:52:03.910 --> 00:52:05.810
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once a year depending on,</v>

1232
00:52:05.840 --> 00:52:06.760
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1233
00:52:07.010 --> 00:52:08.220
<v Speaker 3>and always loved it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1234
00:52:08.270 --> 00:52:09.103
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I were left with one thing might be </v>

1235
00:52:10.941 --> 00:52:14.570
<v Speaker 3>that one because I liked the warmth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the organic,</v>

1236
00:52:14.571 --> 00:52:15.404
<v Speaker 3>the giggles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the warmth and like everything love </v>

1237
00:52:16.911 --> 00:52:19.280
<v Speaker 3>everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love everybody and it is what I,</v>

1238
00:52:19.560 --> 00:52:21.020
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when people used to talk about like what</v>

1239
00:52:21.021 --> 00:52:22.160
<v Speaker 3>ecstasy was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

1240
00:52:22.190 --> 00:52:23.180
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's mushrooms.</v>

1241
00:52:23.600 --> 00:52:26.720
<v Speaker 3>Like you just feel giggly and warm and </v>
<v Speaker 3>connected.</v>

1242
00:52:27.240 --> 00:52:29.030
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I was like,</v>

1243
00:52:29.031 --> 00:52:32.000
<v Speaker 3>you know what we're going to have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to burning man.</v>

1244
00:52:32.750 --> 00:52:33.800
<v Speaker 3>Couple buddies were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>

1245
00:52:33.880 --> 00:52:38.270
<v Speaker 3>I've done this acid before and I haven't</v>
<v Speaker 3>read the Michael Pollan book,</v>

1246
00:52:38.300 --> 00:52:39.530
<v Speaker 3>but I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>enough,</v>

1247
00:52:39.531 --> 00:52:41.210
<v Speaker 3>there's enough gut to know you've been </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about it.</v>

1248
00:52:41.211 --> 00:52:42.590
<v Speaker 3>There's enough around there that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1249
00:52:42.591 --> 00:52:43.371
<v Speaker 3>I'm ready.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1250
00:52:43.371 --> 00:52:44.204
<v Speaker 3>because I remember in my late twenties </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone being like trying to buy </v>

1251
00:52:46.131 --> 00:52:47.810
<v Speaker 3>mushrooms in there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I got asked and I was like,</v>

1252
00:52:48.590 --> 00:52:49.580
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I had,</v>

1253
00:52:49.610 --> 00:52:51.320
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least when we were kids,</v>

1254
00:52:51.530 --> 00:52:53.570
<v Speaker 3>there was that fear that like you do </v>
<v Speaker 3>acid,</v>

1255
00:52:53.571 --> 00:52:55.550
<v Speaker 3>you could fry your brain forever and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>never come back.</v>

1256
00:52:55.610 --> 00:52:57.110
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I don't know if that was the kind of</v>

1257
00:52:57.111 --> 00:53:00.590
<v Speaker 3>asset people were doing or if it just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People were doing a ton of it.</v>

1258
00:53:00.820 --> 00:53:02.570
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they think now that what that is,</v>

1259
00:53:02.740 --> 00:53:05.360
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's people that are schizophrenic,</v>

1260
00:53:05.390 --> 00:53:06.223
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there's a certain percentage of the </v>

1261
00:53:08.091 --> 00:53:08.924
<v Speaker 4>population,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like they were trying to make a </v>

1262
00:53:09.501 --> 00:53:10.334
<v Speaker 4>correlation between marijuana use in </v>
<v Speaker 4>schizophrenia that it causes </v>

1263
00:53:14.151 --> 00:53:14.984
<v Speaker 4>schizophrenia,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they found out that the numbers are </v>

1264
00:53:16.161 --> 00:53:16.994
<v Speaker 4>the same as the general population.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The numbers of people who use marijuana </v>

1265
00:53:19.881 --> 00:53:23.270
<v Speaker 4>becomes schizophrenia because the same </v>
<v Speaker 4>numbers is just you take 100 people,</v>

1266
00:53:23.480 --> 00:53:24.313
<v Speaker 4>there's going to be one of them is going</v>
<v Speaker 4>to be schizophrenic or whatever the </v>

1267
00:53:26.221 --> 00:53:27.054
<v Speaker 4>number is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether it's one percent or higher and </v>

1268
00:53:28.650 --> 00:53:29.483
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

1269
00:53:29.610 --> 00:53:30.443
<v Speaker 4>they think though that it can exacerbate</v>
<v Speaker 4>the situation and it can actually bring </v>

1270
00:53:34.321 --> 00:53:36.690
<v Speaker 4>it on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like say maybe if someone has maybe sort</v>

1271
00:53:36.691 --> 00:53:37.524
<v Speaker 4>of a manageable cause.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Schizophrenia exists like many diseases </v>

1272
00:53:41.731 --> 00:53:42.930
<v Speaker 4>do on a spectrum.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>

1273
00:53:42.990 --> 00:53:44.040
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is really bad.</v>

1274
00:53:44.041 --> 00:53:45.780
<v Speaker 4>Cancer and his people have a mild </v>
<v Speaker 4>cancer.</v>

1275
00:53:45.810 --> 00:53:50.810
<v Speaker 4>They get over well with schizophrenia if</v>
<v Speaker 4>they do acid or if they do,</v>

1276
00:53:50.881 --> 00:53:53.450
<v Speaker 4>I'm even edible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Marijuana apparently can bring it</v>

1277
00:53:53.720 --> 00:53:54.360
<v Speaker 3>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1278
00:53:54.360 --> 00:53:58.010
<v Speaker 3>I don't think I'm frantic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but anytime I feel like I am,</v>

1279
00:53:59.290 --> 00:54:00.440
<v Speaker 3>I can't eat it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't.</v>

1280
00:54:00.870 --> 00:54:01.850
<v Speaker 3>I'm just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>immediately</v>

1281
00:54:02.260 --> 00:54:04.750
<v Speaker 4>the thing is a little.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You got to do baby doses.</v>

1282
00:54:04.780 --> 00:54:05.613
<v Speaker 4>That's the king.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The key with edible marijuana is great </v>

1283
00:54:08.021 --> 00:54:08.854
<v Speaker 4>at about 10 to 20 milligrams.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then you get to that Joey Diaz level </v>

1284
00:54:12.041 --> 00:54:15.070
<v Speaker 4>where he's doing 500,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>big boy.</v>

00:54:15.160 --> 00:54:16.090
<v Speaker 4>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's,</v>

1286
00:54:16.150 --> 00:54:18.010
<v Speaker 4>he's not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but even he quit.</v>

1287
00:54:18.130 --> 00:54:19.480
<v Speaker 4>He quit edibles.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>

1288
00:54:19.510 --> 00:54:20.130
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he quit.</v>

00:54:20.130 --> 00:54:22.320
<v Speaker 3>I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just like early on I was like,</v>

1290
00:54:22.321 --> 00:54:24.630
<v Speaker 3>I tried edibles and I just remember,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember,</v>

1291
00:54:25.310 --> 00:54:26.143
<v Speaker 3>I remember being in Austin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if it was south by or </v>

1292

<v Speaker 3>Did you have to wear a mask?</v>

1341
00:56:23.090 --> 00:56:25.210
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the dust was fine.</v>

00:56:25.240 --> 00:56:26.073
<v Speaker 3>It was cool and like we start kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>feeling it and I have had visuals on </v>

<v Speaker 3>good place.</v>

1348
00:56:42.850 --> 00:56:45.200
<v Speaker 3>A good place for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just because like,</v>

1349
00:56:45.700 --> 00:56:48.200
<v Speaker 3>visually what's happening is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1350
00:56:48.700 --> 00:56:50.410
<v Speaker 3>is pretty interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like we went,</v>

1351
00:56:50.770 --> 00:56:54.310
<v Speaker 3>we were driving around on bikes and we </v>
<v Speaker 3>see these immediately.</v>

1352
00:56:54.311 --> 00:56:58.300
<v Speaker 3>Then like some couples,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like can you take a picture of us as we,</v>

1359
00:57:12.341 --> 00:57:13.174
<v Speaker 3>there are these like porn stars who </v>
<v Speaker 3>wanted pictures of the are taking </v>

1360
00:57:16.031 --> 00:57:18.240
<v Speaker 3>pictures of themselves and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're like,</v>

1361

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're in the burning man spirit of like </v>

1362
00:57:19.900 --> 00:57:23.470
<v Speaker 3>we'll give him the gift of our music and</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they don't want,</v>

1363
00:57:24.170 --> 00:57:24.670
<v Speaker 3>they don't want.</v>

1364
00:57:24.670 --> 00:57:25.503
<v Speaker 3>I'm not even hitting nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just like literally like driving </v>

1365
00:57:27.221 --> 00:57:28.390
<v Speaker 3>around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've got our little like,</v>

00:57:30.641 --> 00:57:32.920
<v Speaker 3>classical music and they aren't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't give a fuck.</v>

1368
00:57:32.921 --> 00:57:36.250
<v Speaker 3>They don't want any of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then we go and sit and,</v>

1369
00:57:36.430 --> 00:57:41.430
<v Speaker 3>and we're just now starting to peak </v>
<v Speaker 3>right at sunset in the desert.</v>

1370
00:57:42.490 --> 00:57:44.980
<v Speaker 3>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

1371
00:57:44.981 --> 00:57:45.581
<v Speaker 3>it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1372
00:57:45.581 --> 00:57:49.360
<v Speaker 3>this feels like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some version of what heaven feels like,</v>

1373

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like where the sky,</v>

00:57:51.490 --> 00:57:56.490
<v Speaker 3>the colors in the sky are unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And all of a sudden all the desert,</v>

<v Speaker 3>all the sand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know this,</v>

1376
00:57:58.200 --> 00:58:01.770

<v Speaker 3>And it's like,</v>

1377
00:58:01.810 --> 00:58:04.450
<v Speaker 3>you feel like you're seeing some real </v>
<v Speaker 3>like grid work,</v>

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you have that feeling </v>

<v Speaker 3>where you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1380
00:58:07.631 --> 00:58:08.464
<v Speaker 3>I can feel like I'm seeing some </v>
<v Speaker 3>underlying dynamics of the structural </v>

1381
00:58:12.911 --> 00:58:13.450
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>

1382
00:58:13.450 --> 00:58:14.870
<v Speaker 3>I've seen that on mushrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>

1383
00:58:14.920 --> 00:58:15.753
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It feels like you're witness to the </v>

1384
00:58:19.540 --> 00:58:23.100
<v Speaker 3>pattern of things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there's some sort of.</v>

1385
00:58:23.101 --> 00:58:24.430
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the structure of things.</v>

1386
00:58:24.460 --> 00:58:25.960
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's what it felt like.</v>

1387
00:58:25.961 --> 00:58:29.440
<v Speaker 3>You were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're looking at this like this crazy,</v>

1388
00:58:29.710 --> 00:58:30.543
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you've got.</v>

1389
00:58:30.740 --> 00:58:31.501
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you're,</v>

1390
00:58:31.501 --> 00:58:32.334
<v Speaker 3>you're seeing the sand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this very fine light sand with the </v>

1391
00:58:35.770 --> 00:58:36.603
<v Speaker 3>really red mountains.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the blue really crisp blue sky </v>

1392
00:58:40.811 --> 00:58:42.220
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with uh,</v>

1393
00:58:42.221 --> 00:58:44.740
<v Speaker 3>the white clouds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it felt like you were like,</v>

1394
00:58:44.741 --> 00:58:45.574
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm seeing some structural shit that's </v>

1395
00:58:47.141 --> 00:58:47.974
<v Speaker 3>going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1396
00:58:48.100 --> 00:58:48.933
<v Speaker 3>it was quite.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we're listening to this Guy Eric </v>

1397
00:58:50.981 --> 00:58:51.814
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>steve's like a classical musician and </v>

1398
00:58:53.651 --> 00:58:57.190
<v Speaker 3>eating cherries and this is pretty </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking sweet.</v>

1399
00:58:57.230 --> 00:58:59.470
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's cool that you followed it to a t.</v>

1400
00:58:59.471 --> 00:59:02.050
<v Speaker 3>You went with the fruit and know why </v>
<v Speaker 3>not?</v>

1401
00:59:02.051 --> 00:59:03.040
<v Speaker 3>Let's just have it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1402
00:59:03.041 --> 00:59:05.350
<v Speaker 3>why not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think classical music is,</v>

1403
00:59:05.590 --> 00:59:07.720
<v Speaker 3>but it was interesting because I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't.</v>

1404
00:59:07.750 --> 00:59:10.960
<v Speaker 3>So then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so then the sun sets and it's like,</v>

1405
00:59:11.590 --> 00:59:12.423
<v Speaker 3>even at the height of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it didn't feel warm like mushrooms have </v>

1406
00:59:16.571 --> 00:59:21.440
<v Speaker 3>felt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It felt like co clinical.</v>

1407
00:59:21.470 --> 00:59:22.460
<v Speaker 3>Clinical.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

1408
00:59:22.460 --> 00:59:24.250
<v Speaker 4>That's exactly the worry about that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1409
00:59:24.270 --> 00:59:27.410
<v Speaker 4>it's very interesting that you said he </v>
<v Speaker 4>took it riding bikes too,</v>

1410
00:59:27.420 --> 00:59:30.050
<v Speaker 4>because that's in a lot of ways in Omaj </v>
<v Speaker 4>to Albert Hoffman.</v>

1411
00:59:30.290 --> 00:59:33.410
<v Speaker 4>That's how he found out about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1412
00:59:33.411 --> 00:59:34.244
<v Speaker 4>he synthesize lsd and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>got it in his skin when he was working </v>

1413
00:59:38.871 --> 00:59:43.871
<v Speaker 4>with it and then rode his bike home and </v>
<v Speaker 4>on the bike ride home realized,</v>

1414
00:59:44.121 --> 00:59:45.680
<v Speaker 4>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whoa.</v>

1415
00:59:45.710 --> 00:59:49.470
<v Speaker 4>Fucking tripping balls here without even</v>
<v Speaker 4>knowing what tripping.</v>

1416
00:59:49.570 --> 00:59:50.403
<v Speaker 4>I mean he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he knew something was going on and eat </v>

1417
00:59:52.820 --> 00:59:53.451
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1418
00:59:53.451 --> 00:59:55.160
<v Speaker 4>he may,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe,</v>

1419
00:59:55.580 --> 00:59:56.413
<v Speaker 4>correct me if I'm wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I believe the initial reason for </v>

1420
01:00:00.561 --> 01:00:04.400
<v Speaker 4>creating Lsd,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think they were,</v>

1421
01:00:04.700 --> 01:00:08.030
<v Speaker 4>they were trying to come up with a drug </v>
<v Speaker 4>to induce labor.</v>

1422
01:00:08.510 --> 01:00:09.343
<v Speaker 4>I'm pretty sure that was the original.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that's what they were working </v>

1423
01:00:12.921 --> 01:00:13.754
<v Speaker 4>on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And in the process synthesized LSD and </v>

1424
01:00:17.540 --> 01:00:18.373
<v Speaker 4>Lsd as a compound and it's one of those </v>
<v Speaker 4>unbelievably potent compounds where </v>

1425
01:00:26.610 --> 01:00:27.890
<v Speaker 4>someone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it was terrence,</v>

1426
01:00:27.891 --> 01:00:28.724
<v Speaker 4>we kind of described it as the power to </v>
<v Speaker 4>weight ratio is so huge that it's like </v>

1427
01:00:34.761 --> 01:00:39.740
<v Speaker 4>if you had one aunt that dismantled the </v>
<v Speaker 4>statue of Liberty in 30 minutes,</v>

1428
01:00:40.320 --> 01:00:44.420
<v Speaker 4>like that's how,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's how potent LSD is.</v>

1429
01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:45.150
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1430
01:00:45.150 --> 01:00:45.983
<v Speaker 4>I mean I took,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it actually said the empire state </v>

1431
01:00:47.931 --> 01:00:48.764
<v Speaker 4>building.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's,</v>

1432
01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:50.970
<v Speaker 3>I mean I took,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I took a,</v>

1433
01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:53.200
<v Speaker 3>a responsible amount.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I was like,</v>

1434
01:00:53.201 --> 01:00:54.034
<v Speaker 3>I don't need to like</v>

1435
01:00:54.160 --> 01:00:56.990
<v Speaker 4>losing my mind here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've only microdosed at ovenly.</v>

1436
01:00:57.400 --> 01:01:00.050
<v Speaker 4>Well one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one time I doubled the mic,</v>

1437
01:01:00.060 --> 01:01:00.893
<v Speaker 4>but still it was a small dose.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If it was enough to just like I had </v>

1438
01:01:05.591 --> 01:01:06.424
<v Speaker 4>planned the synthesis of the compound </v>
<v Speaker 4>with the intention of obtaining a </v>

1439
01:01:08.391 --> 01:01:12.390
<v Speaker 4>circulatory and respiratory stimulant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hoffman wrote the new substance,</v>

1440
01:01:12.490 --> 01:01:13.323
<v Speaker 4>however arose no special interests in </v>
<v Speaker 4>our pharmacologics pharmacologists and </v>

1441
01:01:16.751 --> 01:01:19.510
<v Speaker 4>physicians.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Testing was therefore discontinued.</v>

1442
01:01:20.020 --> 01:01:20.853
<v Speaker 4>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why did I think I said 25th attempt </v>

1443
01:01:26.530 --> 01:01:28.240
<v Speaker 4>aptly named Lsd?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Twenty five.</v>

1444
01:01:29.060 --> 01:01:31.880
<v Speaker 3>Not knowing he was not after like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychedelic drug.</v>

1445
01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:33.430
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't believe so.</v>

1446
01:01:33.460 --> 01:01:34.750
<v Speaker 4>Dose to four,</v>
<v Speaker 4>20:00</v>

1447
01:01:34.750 --> 01:01:36.520
<v Speaker 4>PM.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Y'All look at it and go down and look at</v>

1448
01:01:36.521 --> 01:01:39.280
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Go Down Clarius.</v>

1449
01:01:39.340 --> 01:01:40.173
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He dosed himself for 20 most intense </v>

1450
01:01:46.871 --> 01:01:47.704
<v Speaker 4>from six to 8:00</v>
<v Speaker 4>PM during that time he rode home on his </v>

1451
01:01:49.481 --> 01:01:50.314
<v Speaker 4>bicycle.</v>

1452
01:01:50.610 --> 01:01:51.810
<v Speaker 3>It's the best.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It feels great.</v>

1453
01:01:51.811 --> 01:01:53.220
<v Speaker 3>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we,</v>

1454
01:01:53.280 --> 01:01:57.480
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we sort of are peeking around sunset and</v>

1455
01:01:57.481 --> 01:01:58.314
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it feels like I'm with my buddy of 20 </v>

1456
01:02:00.601 --> 01:02:01.434
<v Speaker 3>years I've known him since college.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've gone through our lives together </v>

1457
01:02:04.711 --> 01:02:06.870
<v Speaker 3>and there's a thing when you eat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you trip,</v>

1458
01:02:06.871 --> 01:02:09.460
<v Speaker 3>where you're like that space time </v>
<v Speaker 3>continuum thing.</v>

1459
01:02:09.470 --> 01:02:10.303
<v Speaker 3>There's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it feels less linear time where you're </v>

1460
01:02:11.731 --> 01:02:12.564
<v Speaker 3>like I'm having thoughts that I had 20 </v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago and I'm having them today and </v>

1461
01:02:15.661 --> 01:02:18.520
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to have them in 20 years in </v>
<v Speaker 3>like where this,</v>

1462
01:02:18.600 --> 01:02:21.180
<v Speaker 3>the nature of all of this feels a little</v>
<v Speaker 3>less,</v>

1463
01:02:21.240 --> 01:02:22.073
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm with my buddies had been a </v>

1464
01:02:23.371 --> 01:02:24.570
<v Speaker 3>witness to my life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

1465
01:02:25.020 --> 01:02:25.853
<v Speaker 3>So we're having this great large </v>
<v Speaker 3>conversation about our lives and all </v>

1466
01:02:28.471 --> 01:02:30.690
<v Speaker 3>that shit and the sun setting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's beautiful.</v>

1467
01:02:31.050 --> 01:02:34.050
<v Speaker 3>And then it gets dark and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

1468
01:02:34.110 --> 01:02:36.780
<v Speaker 3>let's go watch the man burn now.</v>

1469
01:02:36.780 --> 01:02:40.320
<v Speaker 3>Like you know that at burning man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody gathers 70,000</v>

1470
01:02:40.321 --> 01:02:41.154
<v Speaker 3>people gather.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You go to this big central area where </v>

1471
01:02:44.371 --> 01:02:45.204
<v Speaker 3>the man who has been sitting there for </v>
<v Speaker 3>seven days is then there's like a crazy </v>

1472
01:02:48.391 --> 01:02:49.224
<v Speaker 3>fire starter show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fireworks go off and then you burn this </v>

1473
01:02:53.400 --> 01:02:57.030
<v Speaker 3>30 foot man and it's dark and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>night.</v>

1474
01:02:57.120 --> 01:03:01.340
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's like it was the other side.</v>

1475
01:03:01.410 --> 01:03:03.890
<v Speaker 3>It felt like heaven and hell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1476
01:03:03.960 --> 01:03:04.793
<v Speaker 3>where you're all of a sudden.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's where I felt like it was </v>

1477
01:03:06.691 --> 01:03:09.690
<v Speaker 3>weird because like that's where I felt </v>
<v Speaker 3>the clinical thing where I'm like,</v>

1478
01:03:09.900 --> 01:03:14.100
<v Speaker 3>I feel sort of high,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I now feel actually quite in a weird</v>

1479
01:03:14.130 --> 01:03:16.290
<v Speaker 3>way quite sober.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm,</v>

1480
01:03:16.380 --> 01:03:17.213
<v Speaker 3>I felt like I'm witnessing these things </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I feel removed from them in a way </v>

1481
01:03:20.881 --> 01:03:21.714
<v Speaker 3>that when you're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like when you're on mushrooms in </v>

1482
01:03:25.231 --> 01:03:27.900
<v Speaker 3>some way you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you feel kind of inside of the,</v>

1483
01:03:28.270 --> 01:03:30.150
<v Speaker 3>the flow of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

1484
01:03:30.180 --> 01:03:31.620
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of nature.</v>

1485
01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:33.810
<v Speaker 3>And.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I was also like,</v>

1486
01:03:34.080 --> 01:03:36.330
<v Speaker 3>it's the end by the time of the end of </v>
<v Speaker 3>burning man,</v>

1487
01:03:36.331 --> 01:03:37.164
<v Speaker 3>like there are people there all week and</v>
<v Speaker 3>building it and putting all this stuff </v>

1488
01:03:39.241 --> 01:03:40.530
<v Speaker 3>together and artists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's interesting.</v>

1489
01:03:40.740 --> 01:03:41.573
<v Speaker 3>And then like there is definitely have a</v>
<v Speaker 3>section of burning man which is just </v>

1490
01:03:44.341 --> 01:03:48.920
<v Speaker 3>like super wealthy people showing up for</v>
<v Speaker 3>like debauchery and,</v>

1491
01:03:48.921 --> 01:03:53.280
<v Speaker 3>and like to be around models who were </v>
<v Speaker 3>nearly naked and it's like.</v>

1492
01:03:53.370 --> 01:03:55.700
<v Speaker 3>And that's when you look around and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1493
01:03:55.740 --> 01:04:00.740
<v Speaker 3>and the aesthetic of burning man is like</v>
<v Speaker 3>somewhere between like I'm Mad Max,</v>

1494
01:04:01.830 --> 01:04:02.663
<v Speaker 3>game of thrones and Tron.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's somewhere in that space which is </v>

1495
01:04:08.011 --> 01:04:08.844
<v Speaker 3>fucking Rad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then when you were kind of on acid </v>

1496
01:04:10.891 --> 01:04:11.724
<v Speaker 3>and you're kind of looking around and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>had this feeling of like the rich are </v>

1497
01:04:15.721 --> 01:04:19.470
<v Speaker 3>here to collect their spoils.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

1498
01:04:19.471 --> 01:04:20.400
<v Speaker 3>Like these.</v>

1499
01:04:20.940 --> 01:04:21.773
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that having the great </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience of seeing the sky in the </v>

1500
01:04:25.951 --> 01:04:29.940
<v Speaker 1>desert and all the beauty and when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like wow this is amazing.</v>

1501
01:04:29.941 --> 01:04:30.774
<v Speaker 1>And then when you have something like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fire and then on top of that you have a </v>

1502
01:04:33.811 --> 01:04:34.644
<v Speaker 1>giant group of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seemed and then you realize there's </v>

1503
01:04:37.141 --> 01:04:37.974
<v Speaker 1>not really a lot of law enforcement here</v>
<v Speaker 1>and like just seems like it could be </v>

1504
01:04:39.990 --> 01:04:40.920
<v Speaker 1>completely chaotic.</v>

1505
01:04:41.010 --> 01:04:41.860
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's.</v>

1506
01:04:41.960 --> 01:04:42.793
<v Speaker 3>And it is like the fire itself is </v>
<v Speaker 3>protected because I think someone ran </v>

1507
01:04:45.361 --> 01:04:47.310
<v Speaker 3>into the fire last year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Died,</v>

1508
01:04:47.311 --> 01:04:47.850
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1509
01:04:47.850 --> 01:04:48.683
<v Speaker 3>Fucking killed himself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joe Ran right into that fire this year </v>

1510
01:04:50.821 --> 01:04:54.100
<v Speaker 3>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this year was pretty well regulated like</v>

1511
01:04:54.150 --> 01:04:58.270
<v Speaker 3>because we had seen a couple nights </v>
<v Speaker 3>before at sunrise there was like,</v>

1512
01:04:58.290 --> 01:04:59.130
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have all this.</v>

1513
01:04:59.150 --> 01:04:59.983
<v Speaker 3>It's what I found too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was like the kind of the duality of </v>

1514
01:05:02.770 --> 01:05:03.603
<v Speaker 3>adult,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like burning man feels very much like </v>

1515
01:05:04.561 --> 01:05:05.394
<v Speaker 3>there's this like sacred and profane </v>
<v Speaker 3>shit all happening together and it's </v>

1516
01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:09.473
<v Speaker 3>oftentimes pretty cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And like sunrise a couple mornings </v>

1517
01:05:13.231 --> 01:05:14.064
<v Speaker 3>earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's this like 20 foot wooden dragon </v>

1518
01:05:17.530 --> 01:05:20.800
<v Speaker 3>statue that someone had built and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>are,</v>

1519
01:05:20.801 --> 01:05:21.970
<v Speaker 3>they light it on fire,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1520
01:05:22.120 --> 01:05:23.380
<v Speaker 3>they're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now we're going to burn it.</v>

1521
01:05:23.470 --> 01:05:24.303
<v Speaker 3>Like some dude had spent a year making </v>
<v Speaker 3>this statue is like now we're going to </v>

1522
01:05:27.041 --> 01:05:27.874
<v Speaker 3>fucking burn it.</v>

1523
01:05:27.940 --> 01:05:28.773
<v Speaker 3>And so there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there were park rangers all around it </v>

1524
01:05:31.720 --> 01:05:32.553
<v Speaker 3>and so there's no getting inside.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They light it on fire and then the sun </v>

1525
01:05:36.281 --> 01:05:38.890
<v Speaker 3>rises over to the left and then you </v>
<v Speaker 3>looked at.</v>

1526
01:05:38.891 --> 01:05:39.724
<v Speaker 3>I looked up and there were like 30 </v>
<v Speaker 3>people parachuting out of the sky at </v>

1527
01:05:43.331 --> 01:05:45.670
<v Speaker 3>sunrise and you're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck is going on?</v>

1528
01:05:45.790 --> 01:05:47.860
<v Speaker 3>But it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was really cool.</v>

1529
01:05:47.861 --> 01:05:49.840
<v Speaker 3>I really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I enjoyed that.</v>

1530
01:05:50.080 --> 01:05:53.620
<v Speaker 3>But by the time Saturday rolled around,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1531
01:05:53.621 --> 01:05:54.454
<v Speaker 3>there is something about fire that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>very primal and you can feel like </v>

1532
01:05:57.791 --> 01:06:01.900
<v Speaker 3>there's like there's some pagan quality </v>
<v Speaker 3>to it all and it's cool,</v>

1533
01:06:01.901 --> 01:06:02.734
<v Speaker 3>but it's like you could feel like </v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody's like energy kind of getting </v>

1534
01:06:06.710 --> 01:06:11.440
<v Speaker 3>a little darker and more primal and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I hit a point where I was like,</v>

1535
01:06:11.570 --> 01:06:14.990
<v Speaker 3>all right guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I gotta I gotta get out of this like 75.</v>

1536
01:06:15.040 --> 01:06:18.250
<v Speaker 3>And I also had a fear of like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't scared of the fire.</v>

1537
01:06:18.490 --> 01:06:21.520
<v Speaker 3>I was scared of like I was seated </v>
<v Speaker 3>watching and I was like,</v>

1538
01:06:21.550 --> 01:06:22.780
<v Speaker 3>I'm scared of a trampling.</v>

1539
01:06:22.990 --> 01:06:23.823
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I mean by like the giant </v>

1540
01:06:25.361 --> 01:06:26.194
<v Speaker 1>group of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then also with a fire and then a </v>

1541
01:06:29.231 --> 01:06:30.064
<v Speaker 1>gathering when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're dealing with a big </v>

1542
01:06:31.931 --> 01:06:33.820
<v Speaker 1>gathering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's always the potential for someone</v>

1543
01:06:33.821 --> 01:06:38.821
<v Speaker 1>acting out whether they just need a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>of attention or they go crazy or mean.</v>

1544
01:06:40.150 --> 01:06:42.970
<v Speaker 1>Think about adverse reactions to </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychedelics.</v>

1545
01:06:43.030 --> 01:06:44.530
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And 70,000</v>

1546
01:06:44.531 --> 01:06:45.364
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the potential for something going </v>

1547
01:06:46.601 --> 01:06:47.860
<v Speaker 1>haywire is pretty high.</v>

1548
01:06:47.990 --> 01:06:49.070
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1549
01:06:49.140 --> 01:06:52.550
<v Speaker 3>what I found interesting over the whole </v>
<v Speaker 3>week was because I was pretty skeptical.</v>

1550
01:06:52.551 --> 01:06:54.530
<v Speaker 3>I didn't go in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went in being like,</v>

1551
01:06:54.800 --> 01:06:58.070
<v Speaker 3>I want to experience this thing that a </v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of people have experienced.</v>

1552
01:06:58.071 --> 01:07:00.320
<v Speaker 3>I just want to know what that experience</v>
<v Speaker 3>is.</v>

1553
01:07:00.680 --> 01:07:01.513
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what I've found fascinating is </v>

1554
01:07:03.351 --> 01:07:05.780
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's some law enforcement around,</v>

1555
01:07:05.781 --> 01:07:08.870
<v Speaker 3>there's some ranges around,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's really no,</v>

1556
01:07:08.930 --> 01:07:09.763
<v Speaker 3>it's pretty anarchical,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like there's really very little but in </v>

1557
01:07:13.711 --> 01:07:14.544
<v Speaker 3>is in so much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's actually like some unspoken </v>

1558
01:07:18.651 --> 01:07:20.630
<v Speaker 3>rules that basically everybody's Kinda </v>
<v Speaker 3>following,</v>

1559
01:07:21.350 --> 01:07:23.330
<v Speaker 3>which I found kind of fascinating where </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

1560
01:07:23.331 --> 01:07:24.950
<v Speaker 3>there's no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody's on bikes.</v>

1561
01:07:25.070 --> 01:07:29.960
<v Speaker 3>They're crazy art cars running around </v>
<v Speaker 3>with like fucking shooting fire into the</v>

1562
01:07:29.961 --> 01:07:30.890
<v Speaker 3>air.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there's no,</v>

1563
01:07:30.980 --> 01:07:34.250
<v Speaker 3>there seems to be no like regulatory </v>
<v Speaker 3>board being like,</v>

1564
01:07:34.550 --> 01:07:35.383
<v Speaker 3>let me make sure that the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're crazy 30 foot three tiered iron </v>

1565
01:07:40.731 --> 01:07:43.560
<v Speaker 3>car is up to standard.</v>

1566
01:07:44.780 --> 01:07:45.613
<v Speaker 3>There seems to be very little of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And yet it all seems to function pretty </v>

1567
01:07:50.061 --> 01:07:53.900
<v Speaker 3>smoothly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there's some unspoken acceptance of</v>

1568
01:07:53.901 --> 01:07:56.120
<v Speaker 3>certain rules.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure there are people freaking out.</v>

1569
01:07:56.121 --> 01:07:59.330
<v Speaker 3>I know there are people like it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's mostly people like being like I</v>

1570
01:07:59.331 --> 01:08:03.000
<v Speaker 3>took too much drugs and I didn't hydrate</v>
<v Speaker 3>and like they go to the medic and there.</v>

1571
01:08:03.010 --> 01:08:07.280
<v Speaker 3>But like weirdly I've found it all </v>
<v Speaker 3>operating pretty smoothly.</v>

1572
01:08:07.960 --> 01:08:10.460
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's when the,</v>

1573
01:08:10.520 --> 01:08:11.031
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1574
01:08:11.031 --> 01:08:14.420
<v Speaker 3>the acid then sort of turned a bit where</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>

1575
01:08:16.460 --> 01:08:19.130
<v Speaker 3>there's some darkness here that I want </v>
<v Speaker 3>to get away from.</v>

1576
01:08:20.250 --> 01:08:21.083
<v Speaker 1>It seems like whenever you have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation where you've got a bunch of </v>

1577
01:08:23.941 --> 01:08:27.210
<v Speaker 1>people that want to do something outside</v>
<v Speaker 1>the norm,</v>

1578
01:08:27.211 --> 01:08:28.044
<v Speaker 1>they want to get together and they want </v>
<v Speaker 1>to experience something that's just </v>

1579
01:08:30.780 --> 01:08:33.870
<v Speaker 1>their board society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is their big break.</v>

1580
01:08:33.871 --> 01:08:38.580
<v Speaker 1>And it seems like there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's so much expectations and there's</v>

1581
01:08:38.581 --> 01:08:42.930
<v Speaker 1>kind of a code that these people want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>follow and that code is that,</v>

1582
01:08:42.950 --> 01:08:43.783
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like a utopian vision of a </v>

1583
01:08:46.051 --> 01:08:48.570
<v Speaker 1>better society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if it's for only a week or so.</v>

1584
01:08:48.600 --> 01:08:49.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1585
01:08:49.110 --> 01:08:50.790
<v Speaker 3>And I think it works for a week.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1586
01:08:50.791 --> 01:08:51.624
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if society.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how a society would </v>

1587
01:08:54.121 --> 01:08:54.954
<v Speaker 3>function and like largely lawless.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the biggest rules are like don't </v>

1588
01:08:58.770 --> 01:09:01.650
<v Speaker 3>put your trash anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there's no garbage cans anywhere.</v>

1589
01:09:01.651 --> 01:09:04.530
<v Speaker 3>Don't pee outside like p and a Porta </v>
<v Speaker 3>Potty,</v>

1590
01:09:04.740 --> 01:09:08.250
<v Speaker 3>pee in a jug ticket back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dump it out because there's no mark,</v>

1591
01:09:08.280 --> 01:09:09.113
<v Speaker 3>no leave,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1592
01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:12.000
<v Speaker 3>no mark.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it works.</v>

1593
01:09:12.210 --> 01:09:14.310
<v Speaker 3>But I guess it works for a week where </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

1594
01:09:14.311 --> 01:09:18.150
<v Speaker 3>everybody's agreed for that week and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then you go back to your life.</v>

1595
01:09:18.151 --> 01:09:20.400
<v Speaker 3>But like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I dunno,</v>

1596
01:09:20.410 --> 01:09:22.050
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got a fucking kick out of it.</v>

1597
01:09:22.051 --> 01:09:22.950
<v Speaker 3>Like there's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's,</v>

1598
01:09:23.010 --> 01:09:24.660
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's like we,</v>

1599
01:09:24.661 --> 01:09:26.010
<v Speaker 3>there's one night,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1600
01:09:26.070 --> 01:09:28.380
<v Speaker 3>there are all these crazy light shows at</v>
<v Speaker 3>night.</v>

1601
01:09:28.381 --> 01:09:30.950
<v Speaker 3>It,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it becomes like this crazy tron,</v>

1602
01:09:30.951 --> 01:09:31.784
<v Speaker 3>like light show everywhere you look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you see the horizon for as far as you </v>

1603
01:09:35.371 --> 01:09:38.730
<v Speaker 3>can see is just like people on bikes </v>
<v Speaker 3>that are all lit up,</v>

1604
01:09:38.731 --> 01:09:41.700
<v Speaker 3>crazy art cars,</v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy pieces of art that are lit up.</v>

1605
01:09:41.960 --> 01:09:44.820
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's really wild.</v>

1606
01:09:44.850 --> 01:09:46.440
<v Speaker 3>But like you go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1607
01:09:46.450 --> 01:09:47.283
<v Speaker 3>you ride around bikes and there were all</v>
<v Speaker 3>of a sudden we roll up to this area </v>

1608
01:09:49.201 --> 01:09:50.034
<v Speaker 3>where there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a mechanical arm holding these </v>

1609
01:09:51.901 --> 01:09:53.710
<v Speaker 3>lights that are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1610
01:09:54.280 --> 01:09:56.600
<v Speaker 3>led lights that are in this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1611
01:09:56.610 --> 01:09:59.820
<v Speaker 3>in a circle and you lie below it and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like a light show,</v>

1612
01:09:59.890 --> 01:10:02.550
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's this like vortex light show.</v>

1613
01:10:02.790 --> 01:10:06.030
<v Speaker 3>So everybody's kind of looking up at it </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's really trippy and fun.</v>

1614
01:10:06.031 --> 01:10:06.870
<v Speaker 3>And impairment was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>

1615
01:10:06.871 --> 01:10:09.690
<v Speaker 3>that's a trippy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I laid down and I was like,</v>

1616
01:10:09.691 --> 01:10:12.300
<v Speaker 3>this is red.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then this dude rolls up.</v>

1617
01:10:12.600 --> 01:10:14.060
<v Speaker 3>My friend sees us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1618
01:10:14.100 --> 01:10:15.480
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those costumes of like,</v>

1619
01:10:15.481 --> 01:10:16.700
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1620
01:10:16.701 --> 01:10:17.534
<v Speaker 3>those like tyrannosaurus rex like that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're inflated and the kind of or </v>

1621
01:10:20.491 --> 01:10:21.400
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1622
01:10:21.410 --> 01:10:25.470
<v Speaker 3>you see like dude's like one individual </v>
<v Speaker 3>sides things,</v>

1623
01:10:25.471 --> 01:10:27.210
<v Speaker 3>but they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's super weird.</v>

1624
01:10:27.540 --> 01:10:28.373
<v Speaker 3>So I look at this guy and I start </v>
<v Speaker 3>cracking up and my buddy just took that </v>

1625
01:10:32.740 --> 01:10:33.573
<v Speaker 3>turn a source rex and walked him through</v>
<v Speaker 3>the middle of everybody having their </v>

1626
01:10:37.441 --> 01:10:39.030
<v Speaker 3>quiet trippy moment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1627
01:10:39.031 --> 01:10:42.720
<v Speaker 3>so like this just kind of rolls through </v>
<v Speaker 3>it and he's just like,</v>

1628
01:10:42.900 --> 01:10:44.190
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1629
01:10:44.191 --> 01:10:46.640
<v Speaker 3>and he's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was here before you,</v>

1630
01:10:46.641 --> 01:10:47.474
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's like,</v>

1631
01:10:47.750 --> 01:10:48.583
<v Speaker 3>so it's kind of fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just like everybody's like having </v>

1632
01:10:52.321 --> 01:10:53.154
<v Speaker 3>their trippy moment and then it gets </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucked up and then a minute later </v>

1633
01:10:55.650 --> 01:10:56.970
<v Speaker 3>they're back to the trippy moment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1634
01:10:57.120 --> 01:10:58.200
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got a real,</v>

1635
01:10:58.290 --> 01:11:00.060
<v Speaker 3>I got to fucking kick out of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was weird.</v>

1636
01:11:01.110 --> 01:11:01.943
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that would work longterm</v>
<v Speaker 1>either because you'd have to have </v>

1637
01:11:04.171 --> 01:11:05.100
<v Speaker 1>resources,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1638
01:11:05.101 --> 01:11:07.770
<v Speaker 1>You have to have food and water and </v>
<v Speaker 1>land.</v>

1639
01:11:07.771 --> 01:11:10.140
<v Speaker 1>And then who controls the food?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Water and land.</v>

1640
01:11:10.440 --> 01:11:11.273
<v Speaker 1>I think one of the things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason why it works so well is </v>

1641
01:11:13.261 --> 01:11:14.130
<v Speaker 1>because it's</v>

1642
01:11:14.430 --> 01:11:18.660
<v Speaker 2>outside of culture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like south side of civilization.</v>

1643
01:11:18.690 --> 01:11:20.430
<v Speaker 2>You go to a place and everybody meets </v>
<v Speaker 2>their.</v>

1644
01:11:20.460 --> 01:11:21.540
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

1645
01:11:21.541 --> 01:11:25.230
<v Speaker 2>Nobody has an established like dominance</v>
<v Speaker 2>or domain over it at all.</v>

1646
01:11:25.231 --> 01:11:29.100
<v Speaker 2>You just are entering on the same page </v>
<v Speaker 2>and talking about this a lot lately.</v>

1647
01:11:29.101 --> 01:11:32.640
<v Speaker 2>Like cults never work like there's not a</v>
<v Speaker 2>single,</v>

1648
01:11:32.670 --> 01:11:36.990
<v Speaker 2>like one of these wild wild country </v>
<v Speaker 2>things or you know,</v>

1649
01:11:36.991 --> 01:11:41.990
<v Speaker 2>a waco or the guys in the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was the one in San Diego?</v>

1650
01:11:42.010 --> 01:11:43.500
<v Speaker 2>They cut their balls out of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1651
01:11:43.660 --> 01:11:45.240
<v Speaker 2>Gave.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They never work.</v>

1652
01:11:45.300 --> 01:11:46.890
<v Speaker 2>They never work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one has nailed it.</v>

1653
01:11:46.990 --> 01:11:49.920
<v Speaker 2>Like how come no one can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but burning man's kind of nailed it.</v>

1654
01:11:50.130 --> 01:11:50.963
<v Speaker 2>They've been.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The way they nailed it is they just do </v>

1655
01:11:52.471 --> 01:11:54.940
<v Speaker 2>it for a little bit and then they go </v>
<v Speaker 2>back to life and it's,</v>

1656
01:11:55.050 --> 01:11:59.520
<v Speaker 2>I guess the guy who founded it or is one</v>
<v Speaker 2>of them passed away this past year,</v>

1657
01:11:59.790 --> 01:12:02.790
<v Speaker 2>so they think he was in the middle of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the burn this year and.</v>

1658
01:12:03.300 --> 01:12:06.570
<v Speaker 2>But even he is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not a cult of personality.</v>

1659
01:12:06.750 --> 01:12:08.040
<v Speaker 2>Like I think that's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1660
01:12:08.041 --> 01:12:11.790
<v Speaker 2>if you decentralize that and at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>center of it is like,</v>

1661
01:12:12.180 --> 01:12:15.120
<v Speaker 2>is this fucking man burning?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is like,</v>

1662
01:12:15.121 --> 01:12:15.954
<v Speaker 2>I think if you take that element away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the problem with culture is </v>

1663
01:12:18.540 --> 01:12:19.740
<v Speaker 2>they're all there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1664
01:12:19.741 --> 01:12:24.720
<v Speaker 2>is there any code that isn't like driven</v>
<v Speaker 2>by one central force?</v>

1665
01:12:24.750 --> 01:12:25.583
<v Speaker 2>It's always a person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's always a person that always gets </v>

1666
01:12:27.631 --> 01:12:28.464
<v Speaker 2>fucked up because that person uses it or</v>
<v Speaker 2>an and it's all run through them and </v>

1667
01:12:32.701 --> 01:12:36.060
<v Speaker 2>then if he or she goes away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it's the next round of that person.</v>

1668
01:12:36.380 --> 01:12:37.213
<v Speaker 2>They're always,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's always playing off of this weird </v>

1669
01:12:38.641 --> 01:12:42.660
<v Speaker 2>Alpha chimpanzee instinct that we have </v>
<v Speaker 2>to have like a big daddy,</v>

1670
01:12:42.920 --> 01:12:43.753
<v Speaker 2>the daddy that has all the messages and </v>
<v Speaker 2>is in touch with God or the Ufo behind </v>

1671
01:12:47.941 --> 01:12:49.680
<v Speaker 2>the asteroid or whatever the fuck it is.</v>

1672
01:12:50.250 --> 01:12:54.380
<v Speaker 2>There's always this one person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's Jim Jones or you know,</v>

1673
01:12:54.420 --> 01:12:55.253
<v Speaker 2>fill in the blank.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's someone who has all the answers </v>

1674
01:12:58.141 --> 01:13:00.930
<v Speaker 2>and there's a weird desire that people </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to,</v>

1675
01:13:01.050 --> 01:13:03.900
<v Speaker 2>to look to this one person that has all </v>
<v Speaker 2>the answers.</v>

1676
01:13:03.901 --> 01:13:05.280
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very,</v>

1677
01:13:05.300 --> 01:13:05.710
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1678
01:13:05.710 --> 01:13:06.543
<v Speaker 2>it's a tribal thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's traveling and it's specifically if </v>

1679
01:13:08.431 --> 01:13:11.880
<v Speaker 2>you're someone who gets into a cult,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are searching for something,</v>

1680
01:13:11.881 --> 01:13:12.714
<v Speaker 2>you're searching for some solidity or or</v>
<v Speaker 2>something and and if you've got that </v>

1681
01:13:16.171 --> 01:13:18.060
<v Speaker 2>person at the middle is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got you,</v>

1682
01:13:18.120 --> 01:13:19.050
<v Speaker 2>don't worry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll give you.</v>

1683
01:13:19.051 --> 01:13:20.880
<v Speaker 2>I'll give you the way it often works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are like,</v>

1684
01:13:20.881 --> 01:13:22.380
<v Speaker 2>oh thank God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1685
01:13:22.620 --> 01:13:23.453
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I was thinking I was thinking about </v>

1686
01:13:24.691 --> 01:13:28.440
<v Speaker 2>like scientology and being like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well shit man.</v>

1687
01:13:28.441 --> 01:13:29.274
<v Speaker 2>Tom Cruise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if you can learn to fly a </v>

1688
01:13:31.830 --> 01:13:34.170
<v Speaker 2>helicopter in like four months,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like maybe it's not so bad.</v>

1689
01:13:34.800 --> 01:13:36.060
<v Speaker 2>Bill Bergen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fly helicopter.</v>

1690
01:13:36.061 --> 01:13:38.090
<v Speaker 2>No he doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't use scientology,</v>

1691
01:13:38.280 --> 01:13:39.113
<v Speaker 2>the helicopter instructor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it took them probably a couple of </v>

1692
01:13:41.340 --> 01:13:42.900
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it took them that long,</v>

1693
01:13:43.110 --> 01:13:47.610
<v Speaker 2>but Gilbert did fucking billboard is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>dude who likes to like figure stuff out.</v>

1694
01:13:48.090 --> 01:13:49.530
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a really good drummer.</v>

1695

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1698
01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:01.110
<v Speaker 2>But in his cars like he is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he is building that truck.</v>

1699
01:14:01.220 --> 01:14:03.060

<v Speaker 1>My brain wants that.</v>

1721
01:14:55.811 --> 01:14:57.490
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I do yoga now.</v>

1722
01:14:58.480 --> 01:15:01.720
<v Speaker 1>Do the hot yoga or regular yoga,</v>
<v Speaker 1>regular yoga to do hot yoga.</v>

1723
01:15:02.110 --> 01:15:02.890
<v Speaker 1>Hot Yoga.</v>

1724
01:15:02.890 --> 01:15:04.780
<v Speaker 1>Just get that fucking sweat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1725
01:15:04.781 --> 01:15:05.351
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1726
01:15:05.351 --> 01:15:06.340
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

1727
01:15:06.400 --> 01:15:08.360
<v Speaker 1>there's a study that they just did on it</v>
<v Speaker 1>or they're,</v>

1728
01:15:08.361 --> 01:15:09.194
<v Speaker 1>they're in the process of doing it right</v>
<v Speaker 1>now at Harvard where they're trying to </v>

1729
01:15:11.831 --> 01:15:12.664
<v Speaker 1>find out whether you can get similar </v>
<v Speaker 1>results to sauna that you get for hot </v>

1730
01:15:18.311 --> 01:15:20.460
<v Speaker 1>yoga because they think it's a similar </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation.</v>

1731
01:15:20.480 --> 01:15:25.090
<v Speaker 1>The top with what's called sidechains </v>
<v Speaker 1>heat shock proteins.</v>

1732
01:15:25.600 --> 01:15:29.470
<v Speaker 1>And what would they showed in these </v>
<v Speaker 1>saunas studies.</v>

1733
01:15:29.471 --> 01:15:30.304
<v Speaker 1>Is that 20 minutes a day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>four times a week decreased all cause </v>

1734
01:15:34.541 --> 01:15:38.530
<v Speaker 1>mortality by 40 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All cause all cause mortality,</v>

1735
01:15:38.531 --> 01:15:40.330
<v Speaker 1>meaning heart attack,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stroke,</v>

1736
01:15:40.331 --> 01:15:43.210
<v Speaker 1>cancer from just sweating and sweating </v>
<v Speaker 1>it out.</v>

1737
01:15:43.230 --> 01:15:44.063
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well your body reacts to that extreme </v>

1738
01:15:45.581 --> 01:15:48.160
<v Speaker 1>heat when it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe the number.</v>

1739
01:15:48.161 --> 01:15:49.950
<v Speaker 1>What did Ron say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was it one 80?</v>

1740
01:15:50.190 --> 01:15:55.190
<v Speaker 1>I think she said 180 degrees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One slash 71 80 or something like that.</v>

1741
01:15:55.840 --> 01:15:56.800
<v Speaker 1>One seven year one eight.</v>

1742
01:15:56.950 --> 01:16:01.270
<v Speaker 1>And you do that for 20 minutes four </v>
<v Speaker 1>times a week and it's,</v>

1743
01:16:01.420 --> 01:16:02.253
<v Speaker 1>there's a radical decreasing of your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just your overall systemic inflammation </v>

1744
01:16:08.080 --> 01:16:09.550
<v Speaker 1>because of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's getting it.</v>

1745
01:16:09.551 --> 01:16:11.920
<v Speaker 1>That hot makes you less inflamed because</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

1746
01:16:11.980 --> 01:16:13.450
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got it out of our system there.</v>

1747
01:16:13.480 --> 01:16:14.950
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your body reacts to it.</v>

1748
01:16:14.990 --> 01:16:15.823
<v Speaker 1>Your body reacts to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He and it produces these heat shock </v>

1749
01:16:18.311 --> 01:16:19.144
<v Speaker 1>proteins and these heat shock proteins </v>
<v Speaker 1>apparently had just fantastic at </v>

1750
01:16:22.541 --> 01:16:25.150
<v Speaker 1>decreasing inflammation all throughout </v>
<v Speaker 1>your body.</v>

1751
01:16:25.780 --> 01:16:28.000
<v Speaker 1>I gotta figure that out because it's all</v>
<v Speaker 1>based for me.</v>

1752
01:16:28.001 --> 01:16:31.280
<v Speaker 1>Is like turning red one here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1753
01:16:31.300 --> 01:16:32.133
<v Speaker 1>fucking love it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I use it all the time almost every day </v>

1754
01:16:34.360 --> 01:16:37.020
<v Speaker 1>and you just sweat it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go in there and crank that bitch up.</v>

1755
01:16:37.030 --> 01:16:37.863
<v Speaker 1>And I found that air pods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can put air pods and they don't </v>

1756
01:16:42.190 --> 01:16:43.740
<v Speaker 1>overheat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your phone will overheat.</v>

1757
01:16:43.760 --> 01:16:45.160
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't have your phone in there.</v>

1758
01:16:45.160 --> 01:16:45.993
<v Speaker 1>It'll shut off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1759
01:16:46.060 --> 01:16:46.893
<v Speaker 1>But you could have your phone outside </v>
<v Speaker 1>the song and have the air pods on and </v>

1760
01:16:49.271 --> 01:16:51.790
<v Speaker 1>you can just listen to a podcast or </v>
<v Speaker 1>listen to a book on tape.</v>

1761
01:16:51.820 --> 01:16:54.790
<v Speaker 1>What are you listening to?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A visually podcasts?</v>

1762
01:16:55.100 --> 01:16:56.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He lives in New York.</v>

1763
01:16:57.220 --> 01:16:58.053
<v Speaker 1>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I listened to mine if it sucked or if </v>

1764
01:17:00.461 --> 01:17:02.350
<v Speaker 1>it's something that I need to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1765
01:17:02.530 --> 01:17:06.610
<v Speaker 1>like Rhonda Patrick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's spouting out science and I have to</v>

1766
01:17:06.611 --> 01:17:08.830
<v Speaker 1>hear it over and over again to get it </v>
<v Speaker 1>into my stupid brain.</v>

1767
01:17:09.200 --> 01:17:09.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1768
01:17:09.710 --> 01:17:10.543
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or if I have liked that podcast sucked </v>

1769
01:17:12.801 --> 01:17:15.680
<v Speaker 1>and I need to listen to it to find out </v>
<v Speaker 1>where it went off the rails,</v>

1770
01:17:16.140 --> 01:17:17.480
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's.</v>

1771
01:17:17.481 --> 01:17:18.314
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's isn't that the bummer of being a </v>

1772
01:17:20.120 --> 01:17:20.953
<v Speaker 1>try to be a good at what you do is being</v>
<v Speaker 1>like paying more attention to the shit </v>

1773
01:17:23.511 --> 01:17:26.630
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to like a bad sets,</v>

1774
01:17:26.631 --> 01:17:29.600
<v Speaker 1>bad comedy sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always listen to those.</v>

1775
01:17:29.690 --> 01:17:30.523
<v Speaker 1>I fucking hate him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even like listen to the good </v>

1776
01:17:32.391 --> 01:17:35.330
<v Speaker 1>ones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the bad ones are ruthlessly painful.</v>

1777
01:17:35.370 --> 01:17:36.203
<v Speaker 1>Fuck</v>

1778
01:17:36.470 --> 01:17:37.303
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I got to listen to the good ones </v>

1779
01:17:38.901 --> 01:17:40.490
<v Speaker 3>because I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I'm like,</v>

1780
01:17:40.491 --> 01:17:43.360
<v Speaker 3>what did I not like?</v>
<v Speaker 3>W W,</v>

1781
01:17:43.361 --> 01:17:45.350
<v Speaker 3>w what was so special about me?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But being like,</v>

1782
01:17:45.380 --> 01:17:47.220
<v Speaker 3>oh I improvise this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this and this.</v>

1783
01:17:47.230 --> 01:17:50.290
<v Speaker 3>So that's big too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the problem is like part of the joy.</v>

1784
01:17:50.630 --> 01:17:51.463
<v Speaker 3>The reason it was fun because it felt </v>
<v Speaker 3>fresh and then you try to recreate it </v>

1785
01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.010
<v Speaker 3>and it just doesn't have the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking juice.</v>

1786
01:17:58.100 --> 01:18:02.270
<v Speaker 1>It's possible to recreate some things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1787
01:18:02.271 --> 01:18:05.060
<v Speaker 1>Some things they just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were in the moment,</v>

1788
01:18:05.090 --> 01:18:05.923
<v Speaker 1>the audience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a thing that the audience knows </v>

1789
01:18:07.521 --> 01:18:08.354
<v Speaker 1>to like if you have a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>have you ever seen a guy who's faking </v>

1790
01:18:12.110 --> 01:18:14.480
<v Speaker 1>improvising?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the saddest thing ever.</v>

1791
01:18:14.840 --> 01:18:17.120
<v Speaker 1>When you see someone work the crowd and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then you go,</v>

1792
01:18:17.121 --> 01:18:20.890
<v Speaker 1>this guy's brilliant and they see him </v>
<v Speaker 1>the next night he does the same shit and</v>

1793
01:18:20.900 --> 01:18:22.160
<v Speaker 1>you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1794
01:18:22.161 --> 01:18:23.280
<v Speaker 1>it's a trek.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1795
01:18:23.660 --> 01:18:26.180
<v Speaker 1>well you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can.</v>

1796
01:18:26.510 --> 01:18:27.343
<v Speaker 1>There's a moment that happens when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're improvising with an audience </v>

1797
01:18:30.711 --> 01:18:31.544
<v Speaker 1>where someone says something and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>just have the perfect response out of </v>

1798
01:18:33.741 --> 01:18:34.574
<v Speaker 1>nowhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They know that you just came up with it </v>

1799
01:18:36.130 --> 01:18:41.130
<v Speaker 1>and nowhere and it just works,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's also lines that you add to a</v>

1800
01:18:41.361 --> 01:18:44.870
<v Speaker 1>bit that just came up out of nowhere and</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe they just crushed that night,</v>

1801
01:18:45.140 --> 01:18:45.973
<v Speaker 1>but they're still viable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something to it you to figure </v>

1802
01:18:48.201 --> 01:18:49.020
<v Speaker 1>out how to</v>

1803
01:18:49.020 --> 01:18:50.160
<v Speaker 3>create it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

1804
01:18:50.161 --> 01:18:53.130
<v Speaker 3>but it's that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's that feeling also of not wanting to</v>

1805
01:18:53.131 --> 01:18:58.131
<v Speaker 3>be a how do you build material onstage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>keep it,</v>

1806
01:18:58.410 --> 01:19:00.750
<v Speaker 3>have it feel fresh without feeling like </v>
<v Speaker 3>a fraud.</v>

1807
01:19:00.751 --> 01:19:02.130
<v Speaker 3>Like a parliament.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Judicious.</v>

1808
01:19:02.160 --> 01:19:03.300
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which I think is,</v>

1809
01:19:03.500 --> 01:19:06.030
<v Speaker 3>which is sort of like the tricky,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the tricky thing to do.</v>

1810
01:19:06.250 --> 01:19:10.880
<v Speaker 1>You got to be less self aware and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>got to be more involved.</v>

1811
01:19:10.910 --> 01:19:11.743
<v Speaker 1>Like for me at least I have to be more </v>
<v Speaker 1>connected to the idea that I'm saying </v>

1812
01:19:17.120 --> 01:19:17.953
<v Speaker 1>like I have to recreate my own personal </v>
<v Speaker 1>wonderment that's involved in the idea </v>

1813
01:19:24.380 --> 01:19:27.360
<v Speaker 1>because they can smell it if you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

1814
01:19:27.361 --> 01:19:29.150
<v Speaker 1>Like you have to really be in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>moment.</v>

1815
01:19:29.151 --> 01:19:30.830
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're doing a bit about bottled</v>
<v Speaker 1>water,</v>

1816
01:19:30.831 --> 01:19:33.020
<v Speaker 1>you have to be thinking about bottled </v>
<v Speaker 1>water.</v>

1817
01:19:33.280 --> 01:19:37.490
<v Speaker 1>Like you have to be like what in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck it and then it has to be real.</v>

1818
01:19:37.550 --> 01:19:38.383
<v Speaker 1>It has to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you're not thinking about it and </v>

1819
01:19:40.161 --> 01:19:43.130
<v Speaker 1>you're just saying the words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they fucking smelly,</v>

1820
01:19:44.240 --> 01:19:46.110
<v Speaker 1>smelly animals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they fucking know it.</v>

1821
01:19:46.140 --> 01:19:47.020
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even when they,</v>

1822
01:19:47.070 --> 01:19:48.810
<v Speaker 3>even when they're psyched to see you and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they liked you,</v>

1823
01:19:48.811 --> 01:19:52.060
<v Speaker 3>it's still there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Still like a weird thing.</v>

1824
01:19:52.300 --> 01:19:53.760
<v Speaker 3>You're not in it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1825
01:19:53.880 --> 01:19:56.280
<v Speaker 3>I can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you got to be warm or you back out.</v>

1826
01:19:56.281 --> 01:19:56.641
<v Speaker 3>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

1827
01:19:56.641 --> 01:19:59.080
<v Speaker 3>I mean I've seen you doing spots.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're back out building the new.</v>

1828
01:19:59.180 --> 01:20:01.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm at like 25,</v>

1829
01:20:01.640 --> 01:20:04.060
<v Speaker 1>30 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck Ish.</v>

1830
01:20:04.070 --> 01:20:06.710
<v Speaker 1>Right now I just can't seem to because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a grind.</v>

1831
01:20:07.310 --> 01:20:08.160
<v Speaker 1>It's a grind man.</v>

1832
01:20:08.160 --> 01:20:10.390
<v Speaker 3>And I just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how I'm like,</v>

1833
01:20:10.410 --> 01:20:11.660
<v Speaker 3>I do my show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We do,</v>

1834
01:20:11.670 --> 01:20:12.090
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

<v Speaker 3>five,</v>

1836
01:20:14.820 --> 01:20:18.660
<v Speaker 3>six months to write and voice it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>

1837
01:20:18.710 --> 01:20:21.990
<v Speaker 3>and when I'm writing all day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's tough to go out new spots at night.</v>

1838
01:20:22.230 --> 01:20:25.640
<v Speaker 3>What was it like to break it up to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>your Broadway Gig for awhile?</v>

1839
01:20:25.740 --> 01:20:27.120
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was great.</v>

1840
01:20:27.121 --> 01:20:30.360
<v Speaker 3>I mean that was the most fun that was </v>
<v Speaker 3>like me and Melanie do.</v>

1841
01:20:30.390 --> 01:20:33.420
<v Speaker 3>We did it off Broadway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1842
01:20:33.450 --> 01:20:36.270
<v Speaker 3>for like 25 days,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

1843
01:20:36.330 --> 01:20:39.870
<v Speaker 3>And then toward it a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>five days in Boston,</v>

1844
01:20:39.871 --> 01:20:41.580
<v Speaker 3>five days in DC,</v>
<v Speaker 3>la,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1847
01:20:43.560 --> 01:20:45.060
<v Speaker 3>and then we went back into the Broadway </v>
<v Speaker 3>show.</v>

1848
01:20:45.061 --> 01:20:49.470
<v Speaker 3>We did 140 shows like 138 shows every </v>
<v Speaker 3>night,</v>

1849
01:20:49.640 --> 01:20:51.780
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>five show weekends.</v>

1850
01:20:52.080 --> 01:20:56.370
<v Speaker 3>And that was the most fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was the most fun because it's,</v>

1851
01:20:56.371 --> 01:20:57.780
<v Speaker 3>you're onstage with your buddy.</v>

1852
01:20:58.620 --> 01:21:01.230
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you got someone even on the nights is</v>

1853
01:21:01.231 --> 01:21:02.070
<v Speaker 3>not working,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1854
01:21:02.071 --> 01:21:03.650
<v Speaker 3>when you're doing a show and you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1855
01:21:03.660 --> 01:21:05.730
<v Speaker 3>I know they liked me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this is not fun.</v>

1856
01:21:05.760 --> 01:21:06.870
<v Speaker 3>They're tired,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

1857
01:21:06.871 --> 01:21:08.850
<v Speaker 3>And you got it right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're up there alone.</v>

1858
01:21:09.090 --> 01:21:09.923
<v Speaker 3>All of a sudden you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got someone else up there who you </v>

1859
01:21:11.220 --> 01:21:12.420
<v Speaker 3>can make eye contact with me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1860
01:21:12.421 --> 01:21:16.290
<v Speaker 3>fuck these fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's fuck them a little bit.</v>

1861
01:21:16.340 --> 01:21:19.590
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Without saying a word we both know we're</v>

1862
01:21:19.591 --> 01:21:20.970
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's fuck with them tonight.</v>

1863
01:21:21.360 --> 01:21:22.370
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we,</v>

1864
01:21:22.440 --> 01:21:25.020
<v Speaker 3>because we wrote it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we could improvise,</v>

1865
01:21:25.021 --> 01:21:25.854
<v Speaker 3>change whatever we wanted every night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like having a standup set that </v>

1866
01:21:28.861 --> 01:21:33.450
<v Speaker 3>you could improvise with your buddy in </v>
<v Speaker 3>character that was,</v>

1867
01:21:33.510 --> 01:21:37.170
<v Speaker 3>you knew every beat you had to hit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you had a lot of freedom within it.</v>

1868
01:21:37.190 --> 01:21:39.060
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was the most fun.</v>

1869
01:21:39.180 --> 01:21:43.160
<v Speaker 3>So it's like stand up but not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1870
01:21:43.170 --> 01:21:44.003
<v Speaker 3>like it was largely we built it to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>presentational so we could talk to the </v>

1871
01:21:47.851 --> 01:21:48.684
<v Speaker 3>audience at any point because there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>something about doing like a play or </v>

1872
01:21:51.511 --> 01:21:55.110
<v Speaker 3>even when I was early on doing sketch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's embarrassing,</v>

1873
01:21:56.190 --> 01:21:57.330
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>

1874
01:21:57.820 --> 01:21:58.653
<v Speaker 3>we're going to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess we're going to pretend like </v>

1875
01:22:00.181 --> 01:22:02.700
<v Speaker 3>we're in a fucking Chinese restaurant </v>
<v Speaker 3>right now,</v>

1876
01:22:02.970 --> 01:22:05.580
<v Speaker 3>but you're in the audience were all in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the same room right now.</v>

1877
01:22:06.060 --> 01:22:08.610
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it sucks to not be able to do a joke and</v>

1878
01:22:08.611 --> 01:22:09.444
<v Speaker 3>not have a work and not be able to like </v>
<v Speaker 3>talk to the audience about it or be </v>

1879
01:22:11.701 --> 01:22:13.590
<v Speaker 3>angry at the audience directly or </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is.</v>

1880
01:22:14.070 --> 01:22:14.903
<v Speaker 3>So we could do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we are presentational like you're </v>

1881
01:22:16.471 --> 01:22:17.304
<v Speaker 3>doing standup,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we've written this play that has </v>

1882
01:22:18.361 --> 01:22:21.630
<v Speaker 3>real scenes in it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then we built in an interview in the</v>

1883
01:22:21.631 --> 01:22:24.930
<v Speaker 3>middle where we would interview </v>
<v Speaker 3>different people like on the,</v>

1884
01:22:25.020 --> 01:22:28.680
<v Speaker 3>on the Netflix special,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Steve Martin and uh,</v>

1885
01:22:28.830 --> 01:22:31.410
<v Speaker 3>and we also had Michael J.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fox was on special as well,</v>

1886
01:22:31.411 --> 01:22:33.930
<v Speaker 3>but every night it was someone different</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it was anyone from,</v>

1887
01:22:34.560 --> 01:22:36.870
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we got letterman to do it,</v>

1888
01:22:36.871 --> 01:22:40.310
<v Speaker 3>but we also had like Robin Byrd,</v>
<v Speaker 3>remember Robin Byrd,</v>

1889
01:22:40.340 --> 01:22:45.340
<v Speaker 3>she was the channel Jay cable access </v>
<v Speaker 3>porn stripper interview show in New York</v>

1890
01:22:45.811 --> 01:22:46.644
<v Speaker 3>and like the eighties and nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is no reason you would know it </v>

1891
01:22:48.751 --> 01:22:53.280
<v Speaker 3>except if like you were 13 and going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>sleep at your friend's house in the city</v>

1892
01:22:53.281 --> 01:22:56.520
<v Speaker 3>and jerking off the fucking street </v>
<v Speaker 3>troopers getting interviewed like I was.</v>

1893
01:22:57.210 --> 01:23:00.900
<v Speaker 3>I kind of remember the name.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I kind of remember that Google,</v>

1894
01:23:00.901 --> 01:23:02.520
<v Speaker 3>Robin Byrd,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll see some old.</v>

1895
01:23:02.521 --> 01:23:03.940
<v Speaker 3>There she is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1896
01:23:03.941 --> 01:23:08.380
<v Speaker 3>it was like you could just the quality </v>
<v Speaker 3>of that kind of like cable access,</v>

1897
01:23:08.440 --> 01:23:11.130
<v Speaker 3>eighties New York Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1898
01:23:11.290 --> 01:23:12.123
<v Speaker 3>we had her on the show because we felt </v>
<v Speaker 3>like our boys would be interacting with </v>

1899
01:23:15.191 --> 01:23:16.570
<v Speaker 3>Robin Byrd,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

1900
01:23:16.980 --> 01:23:19.840
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we'd have her and then we add like,</v>

1901
01:23:19.841 --> 01:23:21.160
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy.</v>

1902
01:23:21.161 --> 01:23:23.290
<v Speaker 3>So every night we got to interview </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone different.</v>

1903
01:23:23.291 --> 01:23:26.890
<v Speaker 3>It's like a mini live podcasts in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>middle of the show.</v>

1904
01:23:27.400 --> 01:23:31.000
<v Speaker 3>So we just built the most fun show for </v>
<v Speaker 3>us to do every night.</v>

1905
01:23:31.001 --> 01:23:32.470
<v Speaker 3>It was great,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was the most fun.</v>

1906
01:23:32.500 --> 01:23:36.010
<v Speaker 3>And then we finished that and then came </v>
<v Speaker 3>back and I did that.</v>

1907
01:23:36.400 --> 01:23:37.233
<v Speaker 3>We wrote that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we did that in between season one and </v>

1908
01:23:39.251 --> 01:23:43.030
<v Speaker 3>season two of a big mouth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1909
01:23:43.390 --> 01:23:46.900
<v Speaker 3>because it takes so long to write it and</v>
<v Speaker 3>the to animate it and all that stuff.</v>

1910
01:23:46.900 --> 01:23:49.350
<v Speaker 3>So that was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we,</v>

1911
01:23:49.351 --> 01:23:52.540
<v Speaker 3>we wrote voice most of big mouth season </v>
<v Speaker 3>two before,</v>

1912
01:23:53.410 --> 01:23:55.570
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

01:25:17.050 --> 01:25:18.610
<v Speaker 3>versus like live action where you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1947
01:25:18.670 --> 01:25:20.350
<v Speaker 3>I hope I got it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1948
01:25:20.380 --> 01:25:24.160
<v Speaker 3>it's gotta be that's incredibly time </v>
<v Speaker 3>consuming and it must be exhausting.</v>

1949
01:25:24.340 --> 01:25:25.870
<v Speaker 3>It,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it Kinda is.</v>

1950
01:25:25.871 --> 01:25:27.730
<v Speaker 3>It's at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

1951
01:25:27.850 --> 01:25:29.380
<v Speaker 3>am I going to go ahead and do a spot </v>
<v Speaker 3>now?</v>

1952
01:25:29.590 --> 01:25:30.670
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I dunno.</v>

1953
01:25:30.730 --> 01:25:32.200
<v Speaker 3>I mean I think there's a balance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1954
01:25:32.200 --> 01:25:33.033
<v Speaker 3>Like you can't burn yourself out too </v>
<v Speaker 3>much because then you won't have the </v>

1955
01:25:35.351 --> 01:25:38.440
<v Speaker 3>jokes for the next day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'll be too fried.</v>

1956
01:25:38.590 --> 01:25:40.870
<v Speaker 3>You gotta pace yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean everybody works differently.</v>

1957
01:25:40.871 --> 01:25:44.380
<v Speaker 3>Our pacing is pretty good that like </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

1958
01:25:44.770 --> 01:25:46.060
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're.</v>

1959
01:25:46.330 --> 01:25:47.980
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there are certain times where I'm</v>

1960
01:25:47.981 --> 01:25:48.431
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ooh,</v>

1961
01:25:48.431 --> 01:25:50.320
<v Speaker 3>I feel cooked,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's like anything else where you're</v>

1962
01:25:50.321 --> 01:25:53.050
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you train your brain in that space where</v>

1963
01:25:53.051 --> 01:25:54.600
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the first two weeks you come home,</v>

1964
01:25:54.630 --> 01:25:55.463
<v Speaker 3>your brain is exhausted at the end of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the night and then two weeks in you're </v>

1965
01:25:58.661 --> 01:25:59.494
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1966
01:25:59.560 --> 01:26:01.480
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got my endurance back up.</v>

1967
01:26:01.720 --> 01:26:03.890
<v Speaker 3>Like I can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can do that nine hour day.</v>

1968
01:26:03.920 --> 01:26:04.130
<v Speaker 3>Did</v>

1969
01:26:04.130 --> 01:26:04.963
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What did you do to keep your energy </v>

1970
01:26:07.551 --> 01:26:10.420
<v Speaker 2>level during the day?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you take any nootropics are doing.</v>

1971
01:26:10.460 --> 01:26:12.860
<v Speaker 2>It would actually be curious because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>get,</v>

1972
01:26:13.010 --> 01:26:16.820
<v Speaker 2>I get hammered at like 2:30</v>
<v Speaker 2>PM.</v>

1973
01:26:17.210 --> 01:26:20.180
<v Speaker 2>I want a nap and I can't and I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm like,</v>

1974
01:26:20.210 --> 01:26:21.043
<v Speaker 2>I'm not thinking or acting like you are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm like coffee in the morning and </v>

1975
01:26:25.251 --> 01:26:26.084
<v Speaker 2>then um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1976
01:26:26.210 --> 01:26:28.410
<v Speaker 2>and then I crashed and I eat sugar and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then I thought,</v>

1977
01:26:28.510 --> 01:26:29.490
<v Speaker 2>crap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1978
01:26:30.770 --> 01:26:33.680
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what I'm supposed to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll take any,</v>

1979
01:26:33.740 --> 01:26:35.540
<v Speaker 2>any advice you got.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say</v>

1980
01:26:35.620 --> 01:26:38.070
<v Speaker 4>the sugar part is the biggest thing you </v>
<v Speaker 4>should get rid of.</v>

1981
01:26:38.480 --> 01:26:39.313
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the thing that makes it crashed </v>

1982
01:26:40.051 --> 01:26:41.950
<v Speaker 4>the hardest to greet and donuts and </v>
<v Speaker 4>shit.</v>

1983
01:26:43.050 --> 01:26:45.000
<v Speaker 4>They taste delicious,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you,</v>

1984
01:26:45.060 --> 01:26:47.830
<v Speaker 4>your body has a really hard time </v>
<v Speaker 4>processing that shit.</v>

1985
01:26:47.831 --> 01:26:48.664
<v Speaker 4>And afterwards you just bull.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like the other day I was in Vegas and </v>

1986
01:26:51.400 --> 01:26:54.210
<v Speaker 4>because it was a on a Sunday,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

1987
01:26:54.220 --> 01:26:55.090
<v Speaker 4>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck it man.</v>

1988
01:26:55.091 --> 01:26:56.830
<v Speaker 4>I'll just have some pancakes or </v>
<v Speaker 4>something like that.</v>

1989
01:26:56.831 --> 01:27:01.180
<v Speaker 4>So I had crepes and I had um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this yogurt with all this.</v>

1990
01:27:01.240 --> 01:27:02.480
<v Speaker 4>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1991
01:27:03.510 --> 01:27:06.630
<v Speaker 4>now like yogurt with fruit in it and </v>
<v Speaker 4>shed and uh,</v>

<v Speaker 4>oh and I had two cupcakes or to,</v>

1993
01:27:09.700 --> 01:27:10.533
<v Speaker 4>to uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to donuts because they had homemade </v>

1994
01:27:12.731 --> 01:27:14.050
<v Speaker 4>donuts at the hotel.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

1995
01:27:14.051 --> 01:27:14.884
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>call,</v>

1996
01:27:14.950 --> 01:27:15.783
<v Speaker 4>I'll get a couple of days.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I felt like dog shit for the next six </v>

1997
01:27:19.001 --> 01:27:19.960
<v Speaker 4>hours.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was just like,</v>

1998
01:27:20.050 --> 01:27:23.020
<v Speaker 4>oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I felt like I had been drugged.</v>

1999
01:27:23.260 --> 01:27:24.093
<v Speaker 2>Like I was exhausted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your body's probably truly not used to </v>

2000
01:27:26.250 --> 01:27:30.370
<v Speaker 2>like I've trained my customer to it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so yeah.</v>

2001
01:27:30.371 --> 01:27:31.204
<v Speaker 2>But I think there's a certain amount of </v>
<v Speaker 2>you get accustomed to that terrible </v>

2002
01:27:33.821 --> 01:27:36.670
<v Speaker 2>feeling and it's just the normal feeling</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have after you eat.</v>

2003
01:27:36.790 --> 01:27:40.630
<v Speaker 2>But even after like even let's say I </v>
<v Speaker 2>have like a Greens and protein lunch,</v>

2004
01:27:40.650 --> 01:27:41.483

2005
01:27:42.731 --> 01:27:46.840
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Still I just hit that like my body wants</v>

2006
01:27:46.841 --> 01:27:50.260
<v Speaker 2>15 minutes to close its eyes at like </v>
<v Speaker 2>2:30</v>

2007
01:27:50.260 --> 01:27:51.093
<v Speaker 2>PM.</v>

2010
01:27:55.130 --> 01:27:57.340
<v Speaker 2>I need to schedule better into the day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'd be like,</v>

2011
01:27:57.341 --> 01:27:58.174
<v Speaker 2>Hey guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm walking away right now because </v>

<v Speaker 2>what is it like?</v>

2015

<v Speaker 2>Is it a,</v>

2016
01:28:05.650 --> 01:28:07.390
<v Speaker 4>you have different companies that make </v>
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>

2017
01:28:07.660 --> 01:28:08.493
<v Speaker 4>What they are is essentially the </v>
<v Speaker 4>building blocks for human </v>

2018
01:28:10.170 --> 01:28:12.350
<v Speaker 4>neurotransmitter's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a,</v>

2019
01:28:12.480 --> 01:28:16.480
<v Speaker 4>there's a gummies like powder most of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the time.</v>

2020
01:28:16.510 --> 01:28:19.510
<v Speaker 4>Either you take them in capsule form or </v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

2021
01:28:19.511 --> 01:28:20.690
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you drink it.</v>

2022
01:28:21.040 --> 01:28:26.040
<v Speaker 4>Here's a good company that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that makes one called a neuro one.</v>

2023
01:28:26.260 --> 01:28:28.870
<v Speaker 4>I really liked that one because it's got</v>
<v Speaker 4>caffeine in it too.</v>

2024
01:28:29.170 --> 01:28:31.480
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then there's another one called true</v>

2025
01:28:31.481 --> 01:28:33.400
<v Speaker 4>brain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a good one.</v>

2026
01:28:33.790 --> 01:28:37.420
<v Speaker 4>My company makes one called Alpha brain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's my favorite one,</v>

2027
01:28:37.780 --> 01:28:38.613
<v Speaker 4>not just because it's my company,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think we did the best job of </v>

2028
01:28:40.750 --> 01:28:43.990
<v Speaker 4>putting ingredients in that work </v>
<v Speaker 4>synergistically.</v>

2029
01:28:43.991 --> 01:28:47.560
<v Speaker 4>But I'd take a neuro one a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I liked that one a lot.</v>

2030
01:28:47.590 --> 01:28:49.530
<v Speaker 4>How do you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how do you take it during the ticket?</v>

2031
01:28:49.540 --> 01:28:50.700
<v Speaker 4>In a shake.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>

2032
01:28:50.930 --> 01:28:53.550
<v Speaker 4>I just mix it with water in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

2033
01:28:53.620 --> 01:28:57.730
<v Speaker 4>or just whenever you need it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whenever I'll take it before a workout.</v>

2034
01:28:57.731 --> 01:29:00.040
<v Speaker 4>I'll take it before a podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It'll take.</v>

2035
01:29:00.370 --> 01:29:04.000
<v Speaker 4>I take Alpha before every UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2036
01:29:04.450 --> 01:29:05.283
<v Speaker 4>What it is is it helps you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's been clinically proven through two </v>

2037
01:29:07.921 --> 01:29:08.754
<v Speaker 4>double blind placebo controlled studies </v>
<v Speaker 4>at Boston Center from memory that it </v>

2038
01:29:11.851 --> 01:29:15.450
<v Speaker 4>increases verbal memory,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like your ability to find the right word</v>

2039
01:29:15.451 --> 01:29:16.900
<v Speaker 4>for a sentence,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2040
01:29:17.080 --> 01:29:18.540
<v Speaker 4>increases your reaction time.</v>

2041
01:29:18.780 --> 01:29:20.460
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you're doing the UFC shit,</v>

2042
01:29:20.461 --> 01:29:22.020
<v Speaker 3>you just have to be ready to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2043
01:29:22.021 --> 01:29:24.010
<v Speaker 3>There's just no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no live.</v>

2044
01:29:24.120 --> 01:29:27.600
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I'm recounting thousands of fights,</v>

2045
01:29:27.630 --> 01:29:32.160
<v Speaker 4>like if you hear me talk and I don't use</v>
<v Speaker 4>notes really.</v>

2046
01:29:32.430 --> 01:29:33.263
<v Speaker 4>I mean I have some notes in front of me </v>
<v Speaker 4>that like I'll get a guy's record or </v>

2047
01:29:36.560 --> 01:29:39.240
<v Speaker 4>seven and now especially guys that I </v>
<v Speaker 4>haven't seen fight too many times.</v>

2048
01:29:39.570 --> 01:29:41.650
<v Speaker 4>There's a few things that I'd like to </v>
<v Speaker 4>just arrest events,</v>

2049
01:29:41.690 --> 01:29:43.230
<v Speaker 4>like almost if it's all in the back of </v>
<v Speaker 4>my head.</v>

01:30:01.891 --> 01:30:03.670
<v Speaker 3>I was having a conversation with a </v>
<v Speaker 3>friend recently.</v>

2061
01:30:03.671 --> 01:30:05.890
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was like,</v>

2062
01:30:05.950 --> 01:30:09.430
<v Speaker 3>well I remember that your friend is </v>
<v Speaker 3>Brazilian,</v>

2063
01:30:09.460 --> 01:30:14.460
<v Speaker 3>but I have no idea where I was in April.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2064
01:30:15.670 --> 01:30:18.880
<v Speaker 3>it's like I don't know what that is now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if my memory was bad.</v>

2065
01:30:18.940 --> 01:30:19.773
<v Speaker 3>Like I also with the show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>luckily my partners are great detail </v>

2066
01:30:23.261 --> 01:30:24.520
<v Speaker 3>oriented.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I,</v>

2067
01:30:25.120 --> 01:30:28.000
<v Speaker 3>I'm like improvising in the room writing</v>
<v Speaker 3>blah blah blah blah.</v>

2068
01:30:28.001 --> 01:30:29.060
<v Speaker 3>And I like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

2069
01:30:29.120 --> 01:30:32.190
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to type anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just want to like belittle a verbal.</v>

2070
01:30:32.230 --> 01:30:33.063
<v Speaker 3>It's just all verbal and then I'll like </v>
<v Speaker 3>watch a cut of the show and I'll have </v>

2071
01:30:39.490 --> 01:30:42.370
<v Speaker 3>almost no memory of what I've said.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I'm like,</v>

2072
01:30:42.400 --> 01:30:43.233
<v Speaker 3>oh that was funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll have no memory of where it came </v>

2073
01:30:45.701 --> 01:30:46.660
<v Speaker 3>from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where it came from,</v>

2074
01:30:47.260 --> 01:30:48.910
<v Speaker 3>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I'll watch it and be like,</v>

2075
01:30:48.911 --> 01:30:50.110
<v Speaker 3>okay great,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll figure it out.</v>

2076
01:30:50.111 --> 01:30:54.370
<v Speaker 3>But like it just seems to be the way and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if that's what I've done to</v>

2077
01:30:54.371 --> 01:30:56.260
<v Speaker 3>my brain or that's just the way it is.</v>

2078
01:30:56.390 --> 01:30:57.223
<v Speaker 4>I think the funny people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of times they think and sort of </v>

2079
01:30:59.491 --> 01:31:03.960
<v Speaker 4>that abstract way and that usually </v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't lend itself to the best memory.</v>

2080
01:31:04.290 --> 01:31:06.180
<v Speaker 4>It's sort of a wild,</v>
<v Speaker 4>loose,</v>

2081
01:31:06.181 --> 01:31:09.890
<v Speaker 4>impulsive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>abstract quality that in my opinion,</v>

2082
01:31:10.150 --> 01:31:12.990
<v Speaker 4>the my friends,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the funniest friends that I have sort of</v>

2083
01:31:13.230 --> 01:31:14.580
<v Speaker 4>have that thing going on.</v>

2084
01:31:14.730 --> 01:31:17.220
<v Speaker 3>We write your job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you write your jokes ahead of time?</v>

2085
01:31:17.221 --> 01:31:17.750
<v Speaker 3>Do you need.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do</v>

2086
01:31:17.750 --> 01:31:21.170
<v Speaker 4>now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been doing that over the last maybe</v>

2087
01:31:21.171 --> 01:31:23.510
<v Speaker 4>four or five years have changed what I </v>
<v Speaker 4>do,</v>

2088
01:31:23.810 --> 01:31:24.643
<v Speaker 4>but I used to do is I would have things </v>
<v Speaker 4>that I wrote down in notebooks and I </v>

2089
01:31:27.621 --> 01:31:28.454
<v Speaker 4>would write a little bit on a computer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but maybe four or five years ago I got </v>

2090
01:31:32.150 --> 01:31:34.790
<v Speaker 4>a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>became very diligent with my writing and</v>

2091
01:31:34.791 --> 01:31:35.624
<v Speaker 4>so I write out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll write and rewrite and do it all </v>

2092
01:31:39.501 --> 01:31:41.920
<v Speaker 4>over again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Start it from scratch and then go,</v>

2093
01:31:42.620 --> 01:31:43.161
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sorry.</v>

2094
01:31:43.161 --> 01:31:43.730
<v Speaker 4>Go ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Know,</v>

2095
01:31:43.730 --> 01:31:44.563
<v Speaker 4>and then.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then I put it into a thing called </v>

2096
01:31:45.351 --> 01:31:46.910
<v Speaker 4>scrivener,</v>
<v Speaker 4>scrivener.</v>

2097
01:31:47.150 --> 01:31:49.550
<v Speaker 4>You ever use that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I know it is what I'm using.</v>

2098
01:31:49.640 --> 01:31:54.460
<v Speaker 4>I use that so I could switch it to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>lefthand side or it's a.</v>

2099
01:31:54.500 --> 01:31:55.333
<v Speaker 4>all the column is all the different </v>
<v Speaker 4>subjects and then I can move them </v>

2100
01:31:58.960 --> 01:32:00.940
<v Speaker 4>around.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can put this one first,</v>

2101
01:32:00.941 --> 01:32:01.774
<v Speaker 4>that one second,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then when I click on each one that </v>

2102
01:32:03.281 --> 01:32:07.570
<v Speaker 4>it takes me to all of the shit that I've</v>
<v Speaker 4>written on that particular subject.</v>

2103
01:32:07.810 --> 01:32:10.470
<v Speaker 4>I've just found that it makes a big </v>
<v Speaker 4>difference in my.</v>

2104
01:32:10.650 --> 01:32:14.530
<v Speaker 4>My output quality material.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like how much stuff.</v>

2105
01:32:14.531 --> 01:32:16.180
<v Speaker 4>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Taglines.</v>

2106
01:32:16.181 --> 01:32:17.920
<v Speaker 4>I never forget the taglines anymore.</v>

2107
01:32:18.170 --> 01:32:19.003
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you visually seeing when you're </v>

2108
01:32:19.891 --> 01:32:22.500
<v Speaker 3>onstage or you're visually seeing the </v>
<v Speaker 3>tagline in your head?</v>

2109
01:32:22.690 --> 01:32:25.440
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What I do with onstage,</v>

2110
01:32:25.490 --> 01:32:28.090
<v Speaker 4>what the thing that I do before I go on </v>
<v Speaker 4>stage,</v>

2111
01:32:28.091 --> 01:32:28.924
<v Speaker 4>like that day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>usually within a couple of hours of </v>

2112
01:32:31.451 --> 01:32:34.570
<v Speaker 4>performing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I write things out in a notebook.</v>

2113
01:32:34.600 --> 01:32:36.880
<v Speaker 4>If you look at my notebook,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like all work.</v>

2114
01:32:36.881 --> 01:32:38.790
<v Speaker 4>No play makes jack a dull boy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh work.</v>

2115
01:32:39.100 --> 01:32:41.830
<v Speaker 4>I say I write the same thing over and </v>
<v Speaker 4>over again,</v>

2116
01:32:41.840 --> 01:32:44.980
<v Speaker 4>like 40 pages because it's just a memory</v>
<v Speaker 4>book.</v>

2117
01:32:45.010 --> 01:32:45.843
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I should call it a memory book rather </v>

2118
01:32:46.631 --> 01:32:48.400
<v Speaker 4>than a notebook.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's very little of it.</v>

2119
01:32:48.401 --> 01:32:50.760
<v Speaker 4>Is actual writing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Most of it is just like,</v>

2120
01:32:50.770 --> 01:32:54.730
<v Speaker 4>I just want to make sure that I write </v>
<v Speaker 4>down all the beats to whatever bit.</v>

2121
01:32:54.850 --> 01:32:55.683
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

2122
01:32:55.730 --> 01:32:56.600
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2123
01:32:56.900 --> 01:32:57.733
<v Speaker 3>I've never found an organizational </v>
<v Speaker 3>method that I like and can stick to in </v>

2124
01:33:01.041 --> 01:33:02.150
<v Speaker 3>that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like my,</v>

2125
01:33:02.480 --> 01:33:03.313
<v Speaker 3>my shit is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's like my little notebooks that </v>

2126
01:33:05.601 --> 01:33:06.140
<v Speaker 3>are like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2127
01:33:06.140 --> 01:33:06.973
<v Speaker 3>my little that you carry up and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>putting on stage with a set list and </v>

2128
01:33:09.771 --> 01:33:10.604
<v Speaker 3>then I've got ideas in my phone and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got another bigger notebook with </v>

2129
01:33:13.911 --> 01:33:14.744
<v Speaker 3>some more writing in it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I got shit on a computer but </v>

2130
01:33:16.041 --> 01:33:19.340
<v Speaker 3>none of it's centralized.</v>
<v Speaker 3>None of it's like an eye.</v>

2131
01:33:19.341 --> 01:33:21.800
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But [inaudible] I also think of like,</v>

2132
01:33:21.801 --> 01:33:24.800
<v Speaker 3>if I sit down and write a joke,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I then delivered that night.</v>

2133
01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:26.790
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't ever feel like how,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I dunno,</v>

2134
01:33:26.850 --> 01:33:27.430
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>

2135
01:33:27.430 --> 01:33:28.263
<v Speaker 4>It just takes work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you just try to ride it out the way </v>

2136
01:33:31.151 --> 01:33:31.984
<v Speaker 4>you're going to say it on stage,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it will come off clunky but eventually </v>

2137
01:33:34.271 --> 01:33:35.740
<v Speaker 4>you'll get it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the,</v>

2138
01:33:35.741 --> 01:33:36.574
<v Speaker 4>the difference to me is if I just write </v>
<v Speaker 4>in my head and then go on stage and I </v>

2139
01:33:41.651 --> 01:33:44.950
<v Speaker 4>have a good premise and I work it out </v>
<v Speaker 4>and it turns into a bit and as long as I</v>

2140
01:33:44.951 --> 01:33:46.210
<v Speaker 4>do it a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I memorize it.</v>

2141
01:33:46.660 --> 01:33:51.660
<v Speaker 4>That usually does work,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's better if I write it out and do</v>

2142
01:33:52.661 --> 01:33:54.760
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's better if I do both things.</v>

2143
01:33:55.570 --> 01:33:56.403
<v Speaker 4>I still give myself a lot of room on </v>
<v Speaker 4>stage to fuck around and I will just </v>

2144
01:34:00.851 --> 01:34:04.810
<v Speaker 4>take a premise and run with it onstage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if I have a bit now,</v>

2145
01:34:04.811 --> 01:34:09.811
<v Speaker 4>I don't allow myself to not sit in front</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the screen and just write,</v>

2146
01:34:10.240 --> 01:34:12.160
<v Speaker 4>write that bit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like if there's a bit on,</v>

2147
01:34:12.161 --> 01:34:13.180
<v Speaker 4>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>bottled water.</v>

2148
01:34:13.190 --> 01:34:14.023
<v Speaker 4>If there's a bit on bottled water,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I will write that bit out and I will </v>

2149
01:34:17.111 --> 01:34:21.520
<v Speaker 4>write it again and I'll read it again </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I'll just open up Microsoft word and</v>

2150
01:34:21.521 --> 01:34:23.020
<v Speaker 4>start from scratch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll say,</v>

2151
01:34:23.021 --> 01:34:25.570
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's just start that bit over again.</v>

2152
01:34:25.571 --> 01:34:27.670
<v Speaker 4>Let's see what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe if I just did it today,</v>

2153
01:34:27.671 --> 01:34:28.720
<v Speaker 4>would I do it any differently?</v>

2154
01:34:28.760 --> 01:34:31.030
<v Speaker 3>Think you've got to leave that time to </v>
<v Speaker 3>do that.</v>

2155
01:34:31.050 --> 01:34:32.430
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to.</v>

2156
01:34:32.490 --> 01:34:34.740
<v Speaker 4>I really feel like there's a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 4>people that say,</v>

2157
01:34:34.770 --> 01:34:35.760
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right on stage.</v>

2158
01:34:35.820 --> 01:34:37.050
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I run on stage too,</v>

2159
01:34:37.380 --> 01:34:41.520
<v Speaker 4>but I feel like if I write on stage and </v>
<v Speaker 4>I ride in a computer,</v>

2160
01:34:41.550 --> 01:34:43.200
<v Speaker 4>it's better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2161
01:34:43.201 --> 01:34:45.630
<v Speaker 4>I feel like my writing's better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My bits are.</v>

2162
01:34:45.660 --> 01:34:46.950
<v Speaker 4>They have more depth to them.</v>

2163
01:34:46.980 --> 01:34:47.900
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well you're,</v>

2164
01:34:47.901 --> 01:34:51.030
<v Speaker 3>you're taking the time to actually think</v>
<v Speaker 3>about it and then leaving your self that</v>

2165
01:34:51.031 --> 01:34:51.230
<v Speaker 3>route.</v>

2166
01:34:51.230 --> 01:34:52.970
<v Speaker 4>That's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the time.</v>

2167
01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.970
<v Speaker 4>It's the time and the focus,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the amount of time thinking about it.</v>

2168
01:34:56.120 --> 01:34:57.920
<v Speaker 2>That's what I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I liked.</v>

2169
01:34:57.970 --> 01:34:59.390
<v Speaker 2>Especially when I'm on the show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just like,</v>

2170
01:34:59.391 --> 01:35:02.260
<v Speaker 2>that time is not there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm like,</v>

2171
01:35:02.350 --> 01:35:03.320
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to decide.</v>

2172
01:35:03.321 --> 01:35:04.750
<v Speaker 2>I feel like it's just like whatever </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're doing,</v>

2173
01:35:04.760 --> 01:35:06.300
<v Speaker 2>you're going to fucking jump in and do </v>
<v Speaker 2>it or not.</v>

2174
01:35:07.160 --> 01:35:08.090
<v Speaker 2>Whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2175
01:35:08.091 --> 01:35:08.924
<v Speaker 2>that's one of the reasons I like </v>
<v Speaker 2>podcasts so much because I'm fucking </v>

2176
01:35:11.151 --> 01:35:11.984
<v Speaker 2>lazy and you don't have to do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just show up and start talking like you </v>

2177
01:35:15.081 --> 01:35:15.914
<v Speaker 2>and I just talked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we've already been talking for </v>

2178
01:35:17.511 --> 01:35:19.760
<v Speaker 2>fucking two hours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just start talking.</v>

2179
01:35:19.850 --> 01:35:21.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's it.</v>

2180
01:35:21.500 --> 01:35:22.333
<v Speaker 2>But it's interesting like people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>happy to have that digests it in this </v>

2181
01:35:26.181 --> 01:35:27.520
<v Speaker 2>format right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2182
01:35:27.710 --> 01:35:30.170
<v Speaker 2>But do you think you could get away with</v>
<v Speaker 2>this onstage?</v>

2183
01:35:30.290 --> 01:35:31.230
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2184
01:35:31.370 --> 01:35:32.203
<v Speaker 2>I mean you could do a podcast on stage </v>
<v Speaker 2>if they knew they were coming to see a </v>

2185
01:35:34.161 --> 01:35:35.780
<v Speaker 2>live podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would enjoy it.</v>

2186
01:35:35.810 --> 01:35:37.250
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And people do enjoy it,</v>

2187
01:35:37.251 --> 01:35:39.900
<v Speaker 2>but it becomes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you done live podcasts?</v>

2188
01:35:40.130 --> 01:35:40.730
<v Speaker 2>Weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2189
01:35:40.730 --> 01:35:41.563
<v Speaker 2>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially if it's like kind of just to </v>

2190
01:35:43.581 --> 01:35:44.960
<v Speaker 2>chat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

2191
01:35:44.961 --> 01:35:46.220
<v Speaker 2>Like if it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2192
01:35:46.370 --> 01:35:48.620
<v Speaker 2>I feel like I'm ripping these people </v>
<v Speaker 2>off.</v>

2193
01:35:48.710 --> 01:35:50.090
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>

2194
01:35:50.091 --> 01:35:50.924
<v Speaker 2>Unless there's like a specific.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we're like I've done my buddy's </v>

2195
01:35:53.391 --> 01:35:56.040
<v Speaker 2>podcasts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a men's Zucker's,</v>

2196
01:35:56.090 --> 01:35:57.860
<v Speaker 2>Paul Scheer and June Raphael have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>podcast.</v>

2197
01:35:57.861 --> 01:35:58.694
<v Speaker 2>Like how did this get made where they </v>
<v Speaker 2>talk about shitty movies and then they </v>

2198
01:36:01.041 --> 01:36:01.874
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they.</v>

2199
01:36:02.180 --> 01:36:02.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

2200
01:36:02.850 --> 01:36:06.170
<v Speaker 2>and then you do that live and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>audience has been told what the movie is</v>

2201
01:36:06.380 --> 01:36:10.130
<v Speaker 2>and then we get up there and we fuck </v>
<v Speaker 2>around and that feels like everybody.</v>

2202
01:36:10.131 --> 01:36:11.990
<v Speaker 2>There's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there is like a pro,</v>

2203
01:36:12.020 --> 01:36:15.260
<v Speaker 2>it's not just a pure fuck around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a structure,</v>

2204
01:36:15.270 --> 01:36:16.103
<v Speaker 2>there's a structure to it that I feel </v>
<v Speaker 2>like in a live audience loves and </v>

2205
01:36:19.011 --> 01:36:20.750
<v Speaker 2>deserves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they're psyched about it.</v>

2206
01:36:20.780 --> 01:36:22.310
<v Speaker 2>They also know what they're getting in </v>
<v Speaker 2>that case.</v>

2207
01:36:22.700 --> 01:36:25.310
<v Speaker 2>But I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just like us shooting the shit on stage.</v>

2208
01:36:25.311 --> 01:36:26.144
<v Speaker 2>It's like people paid real money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want to see something that feels </v>

2209
01:36:28.101 --> 01:36:29.380
<v Speaker 2>more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jeff,</v>

2210
01:36:29.480 --> 01:36:32.630
<v Speaker 2>you and I were having this conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's 2000 people to our right.</v>

2211
01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.780
<v Speaker 2>It would be very fucking strange.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd be like,</v>

2212
01:36:35.781 --> 01:36:36.870
<v Speaker 2>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>folks will do.</v>

2219
01:36:50.121 --> 01:36:52.640
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing about being in the presence of</v>

2220
01:36:52.641 --> 01:36:54.830
<v Speaker 2>those people is what makes it odd.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

2221
01:36:54.831 --> 01:36:56.150
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's the same.</v>

2222
01:36:56.151 --> 01:36:59.480
<v Speaker 2>It's weirdly kind of what I'm saying </v>
<v Speaker 2>about when we were doing.</v>

<v Speaker 2>fucking people out there.</v>

2225
01:37:02.780 --> 01:37:05.690
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's let them know what we're doing it.</v>

2226
01:37:05.690 --> 01:37:09.420
<v Speaker 2>That's the cool thing about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You guys wrote it yourself and you don't</v>

2227
01:37:09.440 --> 01:37:10.680
<v Speaker 2>have to adhere to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2228
01:37:10.730 --> 01:37:14.900
<v Speaker 2>there's not a producer that stick to </v>
<v Speaker 2>this ancient script.</v>

2229
01:37:14.920 --> 01:37:15.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2233
01:37:21.201 --> 01:37:23.600
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you noticed that you changed this word.</v>

2234
01:37:23.601 --> 01:37:27.410
<v Speaker 2>Like that was what always drove me crazy</v>
<v Speaker 2>was like on set where you're like,</v>

2235
01:37:27.440 --> 01:37:29.540
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially now where I'm like,</v>

2236
01:37:29.750 --> 01:37:31.220
<v Speaker 2>when they wouldn't let you change a </v>
<v Speaker 2>word.</v>

2237
01:37:31.520 --> 01:37:32.750
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>

2238
01:37:32.780 --> 01:37:34.760
<v Speaker 2>You wrote a great joke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

2239
01:37:35.120 --> 01:37:36.770
<v Speaker 2>But I also know I've been in a writer's </v>
<v Speaker 2>room.</v>

2240
01:37:36.980 --> 01:37:41.270
<v Speaker 2>I know that we wrote that joke three </v>
<v Speaker 2>months ago fucking ready for lunch.</v>

2241
01:37:41.540 --> 01:37:42.373
<v Speaker 2>Like this isn't some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this isn't Mozart didn't write some </v>

2242
01:37:46.280 --> 01:37:48.470
<v Speaker 2>perfect song that required.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

2243
01:37:48.940 --> 01:37:51.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I respect your process,</v>

2244
01:37:51.201 --> 01:37:55.410
<v Speaker 2>but also respect that you wrote this </v>
<v Speaker 2>three months ago and we were not in room</v>

2245
01:37:55.411 --> 01:37:56.070
<v Speaker 2>and you were not</v>

2246
01:37:56.070 --> 01:37:56.903
<v Speaker 2>with this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we are now in this particular </v>

2247
01:37:58.261 --> 01:38:01.860
<v Speaker 2>situation on this day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's also realize that that.</v>

2248
01:38:02.190 --> 01:38:03.023
<v Speaker 2>And I accept that when I write for other</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that like whatever I was trying </v>

2249
01:38:06.271 --> 01:38:08.730
<v Speaker 2>to do in that room,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's try to get that.</v>

2250
01:38:08.731 --> 01:38:12.780
<v Speaker 2>But let's also acknowledge where we are </v>
<v Speaker 2>in this new moment.</v>

2251
01:38:12.870 --> 01:38:13.703
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2252
01:38:13.830 --> 01:38:14.663
<v Speaker 2>That was one of the more amazing things </v>
<v Speaker 2>about working with Paul Simms on news </v>

2253
01:38:17.781 --> 01:38:22.500
<v Speaker 2>radio is that he allowed you to rewrite </v>
<v Speaker 2>entire scenes.</v>

2254
01:38:22.830 --> 01:38:23.730
<v Speaker 2>And I've really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2255
01:38:23.850 --> 01:38:24.683
<v Speaker 2>Dave Foley was really like a secret </v>
<v Speaker 2>producer of that show is Dave Foley is </v>

2256
01:38:28.801 --> 01:38:31.320
<v Speaker 2>such a brilliant writer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What would he would do is like,</v>

2257
01:38:31.510 --> 01:38:35.520
<v Speaker 2>there would be a scene that wouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>work and he would sit back and be like,</v>

2258
01:38:35.521 --> 01:38:38.100
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why does it,</v>

2259
01:38:38.240 --> 01:38:39.073
<v Speaker 2>how about it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Vicky comes in and she introduces this </v>

2260
01:38:42.121 --> 01:38:44.910
<v Speaker 2>and then more comes in like here and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then he will,</v>

2261
01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:47.580
<v Speaker 2>he will have like a totally different </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing and he'll say,</v>

2262
01:38:47.620 --> 01:38:48.600
<v Speaker 2>depaul,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2263
01:38:48.900 --> 01:38:51.150
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have a new thing for you.</v>

2264
01:38:51.240 --> 01:38:52.920
<v Speaker 2>Tell us what you think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Paul will go,</v>

2265
01:38:52.921 --> 01:38:54.030
<v Speaker 2>love it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>keep it.</v>

2266
01:38:54.400 --> 01:38:57.020
<v Speaker 2>And that you guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was in rehearsals leading up to it.</v>

2267
01:38:57.021 --> 01:38:58.680
<v Speaker 2>But I think that that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to me,</v>

2268
01:38:59.100 --> 01:39:01.770
<v Speaker 2>the best creators and see are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2269
01:39:01.980 --> 01:39:04.200
<v Speaker 2>I think there are some like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>aw tour geniuses,</v>

2270
01:39:04.620 --> 01:39:09.620
<v Speaker 2>but I think for the firm in general,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the best people are the ones who are ego</v>

2271
01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:14.550
<v Speaker 2>is enough in check that they can be </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2272
01:39:14.990 --> 01:39:17.460
<v Speaker 2>I've brought you in to collaborate with </v>
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

2273
01:39:17.880 --> 01:39:18.713
<v Speaker 2>Let's hear what you have to say because </v>
<v Speaker 2>it might be better and it'll make me </v>

2274
01:39:21.690 --> 01:39:23.460
<v Speaker 2>equally look good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody knows.</v>

2275
01:39:23.940 --> 01:39:27.660
<v Speaker 2>Nobody knows that it's going to still </v>
<v Speaker 2>say like Paul Simms created the show.</v>

2276
01:39:28.080 --> 01:39:29.820
<v Speaker 2>Nobody's going to know that Foley did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2277
01:39:29.940 --> 01:39:30.600
<v Speaker 2>did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2278
01:39:30.600 --> 01:39:32.520
<v Speaker 2>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like rewrite on a rehearsal.</v>

2279
01:39:32.521 --> 01:39:36.420
<v Speaker 2>I think Paul would even tell you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the thing about it was that when you</v>

2280
01:39:36.421 --> 01:39:38.340
<v Speaker 2>write something out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like we were talking about before,</v>

2281
01:39:38.341 --> 01:39:39.174
<v Speaker 2>if you write jokes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't come to live unless there's </v>

2282
01:39:41.550 --> 01:39:42.383
<v Speaker 2>people there.</v>

2283
01:39:42.390 --> 01:39:44.310
<v Speaker 2>They come to life when you're actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>performing.</v>

2284
01:39:44.311 --> 01:39:45.144
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like a joke just doesn't exist in a </v>

2285
01:39:47.431 --> 01:39:48.450
<v Speaker 2>vacuum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

2286
01:39:48.750 --> 01:39:50.690
<v Speaker 2>they've really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You really need an audience.</v>

2287
01:39:50.691 --> 01:39:52.440
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The thing about Ra,</v>

2288
01:39:52.500 --> 01:39:57.500
<v Speaker 2>there's a similar process involved in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>sitcom in that as you're running through</v>

2289
01:39:59.131 --> 01:39:59.964
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it comes to life and then you </v>

2290
01:40:01.681 --> 01:40:06.150
<v Speaker 2>realize the clunky part or you realize a</v>
<v Speaker 2>better way to get to it or you realize,</v>

2291
01:40:06.151 --> 01:40:06.984
<v Speaker 2>well this is the joke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The joke is that he doesn't know this </v>

2292
01:40:08.830 --> 01:40:11.520
<v Speaker 2>and that this has happened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so why don't we have it this way?</v>

2293
01:40:11.910 --> 01:40:13.370
<v Speaker 2>And you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

2294
01:40:13.700 --> 01:40:14.521
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2295
01:40:14.521 --> 01:40:15.331
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2296
01:40:15.331 --> 01:40:17.430
<v Speaker 2>that's how we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we do the show,</v>

2297
01:40:17.431 --> 01:40:20.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have a fucking killer writer's room.</v>

2298
01:40:20.400 --> 01:40:23.460
<v Speaker 2>We will break stories together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone goes off and writes a script,</v>

2299
01:40:23.461 --> 01:40:26.910
<v Speaker 2>comes back and then we'll rewrite the </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole script in the room.</v>

2300
01:40:27.230 --> 01:40:27.941
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>

2301
01:40:27.941 --> 01:40:30.360
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if other rooms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how other rooms work,</v>

2302
01:40:30.361 --> 01:40:31.194
<v Speaker 2>but like we'll read,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll read every scene together in the </v>

2303
01:40:34.291 --> 01:40:35.124
<v Speaker 2>room just to hear it out loud and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>rewrite it based on like what we all </v>

2304
01:40:38.911 --> 01:40:39.744
<v Speaker 2>just laughed at or didn't laugh at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so by the time we're actually </v>

2305
01:40:41.701 --> 01:40:44.670
<v Speaker 2>getting the table read where we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>hearing it again,</v>

2306
01:40:44.671 --> 01:40:47.190
<v Speaker 2>out loud,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even before we get there,</v>

2307
01:40:47.191 --> 01:40:49.860
<v Speaker 2>we've read,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've read it all out loud and put it on</v>

2308
01:40:49.861 --> 01:40:52.950
<v Speaker 2>its feet five times before it's even </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting hurt in that,</v>

2309
01:40:53.350 --> 01:40:54.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the grossest</v>

2310
01:40:54.130 --> 01:40:56.590
<v Speaker 1>thing of all time?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fake laugh at the table.</v>

2311
01:40:56.591 --> 01:41:01.591
<v Speaker 1>Read the fake writers left as you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>performing,</v>

2312
01:41:04.960 --> 01:41:08.050
<v Speaker 1>you feel like a dirty whore and you hear</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're fake laugh.</v>

2313
01:41:08.051 --> 01:41:08.884
<v Speaker 1>I know because they're just trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>sell their show to the networks and the </v>

2314
01:41:11.561 --> 01:41:13.470
<v Speaker 1>networks all skeptical.</v>

2320
01:41:29.141 --> 01:41:29.974
<v Speaker 1>sitcoms anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there was the fucking science </v>

2323
01:41:38.530 --> 01:41:41.110
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the first show that I was going</v>

2324
01:41:41.111 --> 01:41:41.944
<v Speaker 1>to test for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that was the first like thing that </v>

<v Speaker 1>we want to fly to la to test for this.</v>

2326
01:41:46.690 --> 01:41:48.040
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

2327
01:41:48.060 --> 01:41:50.350
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they weren't offering much</v>
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>

2328
01:41:50.740 --> 01:41:52.360
<v Speaker 1>They weren't offering a ton of money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I was like,</v>

2329
01:41:52.580 --> 01:41:53.560
<v Speaker 1>eh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even then,</v>

<v Speaker 1>that shows not bad and those guys will </v>

2336
01:42:07.151 --> 01:42:08.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2339
01:42:11.540 --> 01:42:14.470
<v Speaker 1>Or was it five years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was never a success.</v>

2340
01:42:14.800 --> 01:42:15.611
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2341
01:42:15.611 --> 01:42:17.260
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it bombed every year.</v>

2342
01:42:17.620 --> 01:42:20.410
<v Speaker 1>My friend Lou Martin was one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>know.</v>

2343
01:42:20.730 --> 01:42:21.563
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He used to wear a t shirt every Monday </v>

2344
01:42:23.500 --> 01:42:27.820
<v Speaker 1>of what our ratings were and showed up </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the set one day and it said like 88.</v>

2345
01:42:27.850 --> 01:42:29.380
<v Speaker 1>And I went no fucking ways.</v>

2346
01:42:29.410 --> 01:42:30.310
<v Speaker 1>That really goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep,</v>

2347
01:42:30.340 --> 01:42:31.760
<v Speaker 1>we're number 88.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went,</v>

2348
01:42:31.810 --> 01:42:34.150
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but by the way,</v>

2349
01:42:34.151 --> 01:42:38.500
<v Speaker 1>whatever that number was then would now </v>
<v Speaker 1>be a fucking monster hit.</v>

2350
01:42:38.560 --> 01:42:39.393
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the numbers that we would get in in </v>

2351
01:42:40.781 --> 01:42:43.030
<v Speaker 1>terms of viewers would be huge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2352
01:42:43.210 --> 01:42:44.530
<v Speaker 1>a huge hit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2353
01:42:44.670 --> 01:42:47.860
<v Speaker 1>In comparison it would be the now will </v>
<v Speaker 1>be dead in the water and now it would be</v>

2354
01:42:47.861 --> 01:42:50.980
<v Speaker 1>a huge hit and I'd be psyched,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then there was the sweet spot then,</v>

2355
01:42:50.981 --> 01:42:53.290
<v Speaker 1>which is like between friends and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Seinfeld.</v>

2356
01:42:53.320 --> 01:42:55.780
<v Speaker 1>That was the sweet spot and if you could</v>
<v Speaker 1>get into that.</v>

2357
01:42:55.810 --> 01:42:57.670
<v Speaker 1>Oh sweet baby.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You've made it baby.</v>

2359
01:42:59.680 --> 01:43:03.540
<v Speaker 1>There was the caroline in the city guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Suddenly.</v>

2360
01:43:03.550 --> 01:43:04.540
<v Speaker 1>Susan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2361
01:43:04.541 --> 01:43:08.920
<v Speaker 1>They kept trying to these shit what Paul</v>
<v Speaker 1>Simms would call these shit sandwiches.</v>

2362
01:43:09.190 --> 01:43:10.023
<v Speaker 1>We have these really good shows that </v>
<v Speaker 1>these slabs are shit and between them </v>

2363
01:43:13.120 --> 01:43:13.953
<v Speaker 1>they were fucking terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible shows and they went on for a </v>

2364
01:43:16.661 --> 01:43:17.494
<v Speaker 1>long time when they were big hits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but even in syndication there dead like </v>

2365
01:43:20.411 --> 01:43:22.060
<v Speaker 1>nobody wants to watch them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>

2366
01:43:22.061 --> 01:43:24.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to think if I watch news </v>
<v Speaker 1>radio and syndication,</v>

2367
01:43:24.360 --> 01:43:28.390
<v Speaker 1>that's probably how you watched it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It became a hit after the fact.</v>

2368
01:43:28.750 --> 01:43:30.220
<v Speaker 1>That was the craziest thing about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>

2369
01:43:30.221 --> 01:43:31.054
<v Speaker 1>The show became popular after it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>canceled because it was on reruns on </v>

2370
01:43:34.781 --> 01:43:35.614
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone who was attached to so much </v>

2371
01:43:36.671 --> 01:43:39.340
<v Speaker 1>controversial because Phil Hartman was </v>
<v Speaker 1>murdered and you know,</v>

2372
01:43:39.580 --> 01:43:42.300
<v Speaker 1>before the final season.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2373
01:43:42.630 --> 01:43:45.090
<v Speaker 1>it was all so much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was that weird?</v>

2374
01:43:45.380 --> 01:43:46.420
<v Speaker 1>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2375
01:43:46.421 --> 01:43:49.810
<v Speaker 1>that must have been the saddest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most tense thing in the world.</v>

2376
01:43:49.900 --> 01:43:51.710
<v Speaker 1>That was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was</v>

2377
01:43:52.270 --> 01:43:53.103
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2378
01:43:53.530 --> 01:43:54.363
<v Speaker 4>it taught me a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>First of all taught me do not stay in </v>

2379
01:43:57.531 --> 01:44:01.310
<v Speaker 4>one of those evil relationships because </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's people that just,</v>

2380
01:44:01.670 --> 01:44:02.503
<v Speaker 4>they just don't work together and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>try to make it work together and you </v>

2381
01:44:05.931 --> 01:44:08.840
<v Speaker 4>went to fucking hating each other and </v>
<v Speaker 4>that was him and her.</v>

2382
01:44:08.960 --> 01:44:09.793
<v Speaker 4>It was ugly and I tried to get him to </v>
<v Speaker 4>divorce her several times and he was </v>

2383
01:44:13.760 --> 01:44:17.270
<v Speaker 4>terrified of losing his image.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Terrified of losing money.</v>

2384
01:44:17.390 --> 01:44:18.223
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he just didn't want to be a divorced </v>

2385
01:44:18.951 --> 01:44:21.740
<v Speaker 4>Hollywood bachelor guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>His image was the family guy,</v>

2386
01:44:22.180 --> 01:44:24.200
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a married man,</v>

2387
01:44:24.201 --> 01:44:25.580
<v Speaker 4>family guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everything's great.</v>

2388
01:44:25.581 --> 01:44:28.250
<v Speaker 4>Everything about him is like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I look like a nice man.</v>

2389
01:44:28.340 --> 01:44:29.111
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2390
01:44:29.111 --> 01:44:30.770

<v Speaker 4>exactly the funniest,</v>

2391
01:44:30.800 --> 01:44:33.290
<v Speaker 4>but he was living in hell.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was awful.</v>

2392
01:44:33.520 --> 01:44:34.353
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She would like openly insulting him at </v>

2393
01:44:35.871 --> 01:44:40.070
<v Speaker 4>parties and stuff and we would just </v>
<v Speaker 4>cringe like toxic.</v>

2394
01:44:40.220 --> 01:44:41.630
<v Speaker 4>She hated him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2395
01:44:41.690 --> 01:44:43.670
<v Speaker 4>and she wound up shooting him in his </v>
<v Speaker 4>sleep.</v>

2396
01:44:43.700 --> 01:44:47.030
<v Speaker 4>I mean it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was so intense.</v>

2397
01:44:47.510 --> 01:44:48.343
<v Speaker 4>As ugly as it gets.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean he took like a Nyquil or </v>

2398
01:44:51.411 --> 01:44:52.244
<v Speaker 4>something like that to go to sleep and </v>
<v Speaker 4>she shot him in the head while he was </v>

2399
01:44:54.111 --> 01:44:55.180

2665
01:56:47.730 --> 01:56:51.060

2666
01:56:51.890 --> 01:56:56.490

2674
01:57:13.500 --> 01:57:15.450
<v Speaker 1>He was trying to talk him into saying </v>
<v Speaker 1>that he did it.</v>

2675
01:57:16.810 --> 01:57:18.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>J was more aware of what was going on.</v>

2677
01:57:22.240 --> 01:57:23.820
<v Speaker 1>Then a bunch of the other people on that</v>
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>

2678
01:57:24.120 --> 01:57:27.060
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you'd think he's probably a hyper</v>

2679
01:57:27.061 --> 01:57:28.860
<v Speaker 1>paranoid that someone's fucking with </v>
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

<v Speaker 1>He said that's his favorite name.</v>

2683
01:57:43.890 --> 01:57:46.800
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is insane.</v>

2684
01:57:48.150 --> 01:57:48.983
<v Speaker 1>But you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet he gets a lot of those vacant odd </v>

2685
01:57:51.481 --> 01:57:56.130
<v Speaker 1>young ladies to accept his penis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have trouble believing that.</v>

2686
01:57:56.131 --> 01:57:57.060
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2687
01:57:57.120 --> 01:57:57.901
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you think.</v>

2688
01:57:57.901 --> 01:58:00.580
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever ironically fuck somebody.</v>

2689
01:58:02.880 --> 01:58:04.240
<v Speaker 1>Some gals would do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2690
01:58:04.300 --> 01:58:05.760
<v Speaker 1>Ironically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking murder.</v>

2691
01:58:06.510 --> 01:58:10.560
<v Speaker 1>I guess further can't imagine I maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't imagine.</v>

2692
01:58:10.830 --> 01:58:14.640
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the social like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>currency of that is.</v>

2693
01:58:14.950 --> 01:58:17.370
<v Speaker 1>What Scott Peterson was sent to death </v>
<v Speaker 1>row in California,</v>

2694
01:58:17.371 --> 01:58:20.010
<v Speaker 1>San Quentin prison for murdering his </v>
<v Speaker 1>wife and their unborn child.</v>

2695
01:58:20.040 --> 01:58:20.873
<v Speaker 1>Dozens of women phoned asking for his </v>
<v Speaker 1>address with one teenager wasting no </v>

2696
01:58:24.751 --> 01:58:26.850
<v Speaker 1>time and offering to marry him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2697
01:58:27.030 --> 01:58:27.863
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's A.</v>

2698
01:58:28.170 --> 01:58:29.003
<v Speaker 1>I think this is what I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there is some sort of ancient </v>

2699
01:58:33.990 --> 01:58:34.823
<v Speaker 1>DNA that people have that attracts them </v>
<v Speaker 1>to murderers and conquerors because </v>

2700
01:58:39.481 --> 01:58:40.314
<v Speaker 1>those are the people that survived and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the your some sort of a strange </v>

2701
01:58:44.860 --> 01:58:45.693
<v Speaker 1>inclination for some women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously ones that are not thinking </v>

2702
01:58:49.151 --> 01:58:53.200
<v Speaker 1>clearly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for some women to want the sperm and</v>

2703
01:58:53.201 --> 01:58:56.490
<v Speaker 1>the genetics of a murderer because </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the type of the.</v>

2704
01:58:56.560 --> 01:59:01.000
<v Speaker 1>If you add a murderous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>brave conqueror for a child,</v>

2705
01:59:01.330 --> 01:59:04.610
<v Speaker 1>that child would survive like that DNA.</v>

2706
01:59:05.170 --> 01:59:07.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I get some sense of survival.</v>

2707
01:59:07.121 --> 01:59:07.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2708
01:59:07.670 --> 01:59:10.170
<v Speaker 1>I mean in at times of barbaric.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure,</v>

2709
01:59:10.570 --> 01:59:12.190
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want it to be with someone.</v>

2710
01:59:12.390 --> 01:59:14.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I think it is like a killer.</v>

2711
01:59:15.570 --> 01:59:17.890
<v Speaker 1>So much like the caveman comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2712
01:59:17.891 --> 01:59:20.320
<v Speaker 1>I think that if a male feminist goes to </v>
<v Speaker 1>jail,</v>

2713
01:59:20.321 --> 01:59:24.490
<v Speaker 1>they get zero request for marriage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They get none.</v>

2714
01:59:24.880 --> 01:59:27.190
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2715
01:59:27.220 --> 01:59:29.950
<v Speaker 1>If some male feminist like gets arrested</v>
<v Speaker 1>and goes to jail,</v>

2716
01:59:30.300 --> 01:59:31.440
<v Speaker 1>it's a wrap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2717
01:59:31.650 --> 01:59:33.850
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you're a murder murder,</v>

2718
01:59:33.851 --> 01:59:37.480
<v Speaker 1>you'd probably get a lot because women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a reason why men become.</v>

2719
01:59:37.540 --> 01:59:38.373
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's men who believe in equality and </v>

2720
01:59:40.960 --> 01:59:41.793
<v Speaker 1>women's rights and then there's men who </v>
<v Speaker 1>are really weasley and what they're </v>

2721
01:59:45.401 --> 01:59:46.234
<v Speaker 1>doing is they just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're young and posturing and I think </v>

2722
01:59:50.620 --> 01:59:51.940
<v Speaker 1>those guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they go to jail,</v>

2723
01:59:52.720 --> 01:59:54.630
<v Speaker 1>crickets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2724
01:59:54.640 --> 01:59:56.810
<v Speaker 1>either way they're in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're in jail so they're not.</v>

2725
01:59:56.860 --> 01:59:58.510
<v Speaker 1>They're probably not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how it works.</v>

2726
01:59:58.511 --> 02:00:00.940
<v Speaker 1>I don't know to get places you can get </v>
<v Speaker 1>conjugal visits,</v>

2727
02:00:01.330 --> 02:00:05.320
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's dependent upon the </v>
<v Speaker 1>jail.</v>

2728
02:00:05.350 --> 02:00:08.500
<v Speaker 1>You didn't cosby's getting any marital,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any proposals?</v>

2729
02:00:08.530 --> 02:00:09.363
<v Speaker 1>I bet he does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet girls and trying to get raped by </v>

2730
02:00:10.961 --> 02:00:12.820
<v Speaker 1>him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe it or not.</v>

2731
02:00:12.821 --> 02:00:13.654
<v Speaker 1>I bet there are some girls who would </v>
<v Speaker 1>want caused me to drug them because </v>

2732
02:00:17.090 --> 02:00:20.590
<v Speaker 1>people are fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People get their faces tattooed.</v>

2733
02:00:20.950 --> 02:00:21.910
<v Speaker 1>People,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2734
02:00:21.960 --> 02:00:24.190
<v Speaker 1>there's people that are just straight up</v>
<v Speaker 1>nuts.</v>

2735
02:00:24.191 --> 02:00:25.024
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when there's a high profile thing </v>

2736
02:00:27.341 --> 02:00:28.320
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2737
02:00:28.360 --> 02:00:29.920
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think when I think about that,</v>

2738
02:00:29.921 --> 02:00:30.754
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happened to those people that made </v>

2739
02:00:31.781 --> 02:00:34.540
<v Speaker 1>them to the point where they would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>interested in something like that?</v>

2740
02:00:34.840 --> 02:00:37.050
<v Speaker 1>The person that goes after.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2741
02:00:37.420 --> 02:00:41.440
<v Speaker 1>I have my theories about cosby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that when that happened,</v>

2742
02:00:41.680 --> 02:00:45.100
<v Speaker 1>when cosby first started doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was common.</v>

2743
02:00:45.340 --> 02:00:47.660
<v Speaker 1>I think that whole slipping manish fly </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

2744
02:00:47.670 --> 02:00:48.650
<v Speaker 1>Dash fly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2745
02:00:48.730 --> 02:00:49.563
<v Speaker 1>I think in the sixties and the fifties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think asshole men did that to women </v>

2746
02:00:53.170 --> 02:00:54.003
<v Speaker 1>all the fucking time and I don't think </v>
<v Speaker 1>people thought about the consequences </v>

2747
02:00:57.551 --> 02:00:59.740
<v Speaker 1>and don't think people thought about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>rights of women.</v>

2748
02:01:00.110 --> 02:01:03.460
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you just think about like </v>
<v Speaker 1>chauvinism in films,</v>

2749
02:01:03.700 --> 02:01:04.421
<v Speaker 1>male,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Male,</v>

2750
02:01:04.421 --> 02:01:08.380
<v Speaker 1>chauvinist behavior and sexist behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Men smacking women in films.</v>

2751
02:01:08.580 --> 02:01:12.180
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was really common.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Steve Mcqueen and Allie what it was when</v>

2752
02:01:12.181 --> 02:01:14.650
<v Speaker 1>the alley sheedy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Allie McGraw,</v>

2753
02:01:14.680 --> 02:01:17.800
<v Speaker 1>Allie McGraw beat the fuck out of her in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a scene,</v>

2754
02:01:17.840 --> 02:01:20.470
<v Speaker 1>like an actual scene and she didn't even</v>
<v Speaker 1>know he was going to do it.</v>

2755
02:01:20.710 --> 02:01:23.650
<v Speaker 1>Just beat the shit out of her and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>look on film.</v>

2756
02:01:23.651 --> 02:01:27.550
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the thing that just came out.</v>

2757
02:01:27.551 --> 02:01:29.200
<v Speaker 1>It was like Brando was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh we didn't.</v>

2758
02:01:29.230 --> 02:01:31.600
<v Speaker 1>We just sprung this sexual encounter on </v>
<v Speaker 1>this woman.</v>

2759
02:01:31.620 --> 02:01:33.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That different game.</v>

2760
02:01:33.370 --> 02:01:34.203
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a different world and I think </v>

2761
02:01:35.920 --> 02:01:36.753
<v Speaker 1>there was a lot of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he was always hanging around at </v>

2762
02:01:38.591 --> 02:01:41.720
<v Speaker 1>the playboy mansion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there was a lot of men that just</v>

2763
02:01:41.721 --> 02:01:44.120
<v Speaker 1>raped women and drug them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was common.</v>

2764
02:01:44.540 --> 02:01:47.420
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you've talked to many women </v>
<v Speaker 1>that have had something dropped in their</v>

2765

<v Speaker 3>space where people are not used to </v>
<v Speaker 3>seeing just a straight standup and he's </v>

02:15:52.141 --> 02:15:52.974
<v Speaker 2>happened to be at a park where they had </v>
<v Speaker 2>one of those scientology booths set up </v>

3084
02:15:55.410 --> 02:15:59.790
<v Speaker 2>and I went over there and the guy put me</v>
<v Speaker 2>through the whole thing.</v>

02:15:59.791 --> 02:16:03.060
<v Speaker 2>I hold onto the cans and they're </v>

02:16:03.061 --> 02:16:08.061
<v Speaker 2>but he was so unenthusiastic he wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>selling it at all outside ties.</v>

3087

<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

3114

3115
02:17:13.850 --> 02:17:14.683
<v Speaker 4>okay to be a Catholic and it's not okay </v>
<v Speaker 4>to be a scientologist because Catholic </v>

3116
02:17:18.710 --> 02:17:19.880
<v Speaker 4>Catholicism,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I grew up with,</v>

3117
02:17:19.910 --> 02:17:20.743
<v Speaker 4>is one of the fucking nuttiest religions</v>
<v Speaker 4>filled with kid fuckers where they </v>

3118
02:17:24.410 --> 02:17:26.660
<v Speaker 4>literally have their own country,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Vatican's,</v>

3119
02:17:26.661 --> 02:17:27.494
<v Speaker 4>its own country.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They move priests around all over the </v>

3120
02:17:29.511 --> 02:17:30.440
<v Speaker 4>world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It happened.</v>

3121
02:17:30.470 --> 02:17:31.303
<v Speaker 4>There was a new case.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It just happened a couple of weeks ago </v>

3122
02:17:32.991 --> 02:17:33.824
<v Speaker 4>in Pennsylvania.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They just found thousands of children </v>

3123
02:17:35.721 --> 02:17:36.620
<v Speaker 4>that had been molested.</v>

3124
02:17:38.760 --> 02:17:40.980
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3125
02:17:40.990 --> 02:17:42.790
<v Speaker 3>it's systematic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>

3126
02:17:42.820 --> 02:17:43.653
<v Speaker 3>When did you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was there a moment in the church where </v>

3127
02:17:44.681 --> 02:17:45.071
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3128
02:17:45.071 --> 02:17:45.880
<v Speaker 3>I'm out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm done.</v>

3129
02:17:45.880 --> 02:17:47.030
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was really lucky</v>

3130
02:17:47.500 --> 02:17:51.310
<v Speaker 4>without my parents split up in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When my parents split up.</v>

3131
02:17:51.340 --> 02:17:52.173
<v Speaker 4>I went to Catholic school for one year </v>
<v Speaker 4>after that and then my mom met my </v>

3132
02:17:56.741 --> 02:17:59.130
<v Speaker 4>Stepdad who was a hippie and he was </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

3133
02:17:59.131 --> 02:18:01.330
<v Speaker 4>this is fucking stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the next thing you know,</v>

3134
02:18:01.331 --> 02:18:04.120
<v Speaker 4>we moved to San Francisco,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so we were in New Jersey.</v>

3135
02:18:04.121 --> 02:18:05.670
<v Speaker 4>I was going to Catholic school a year </v>
<v Speaker 4>later,</v>

3136
02:18:05.710 --> 02:18:10.030
<v Speaker 4>living in San Francisco next to gay </v>
<v Speaker 4>people and living right off of,</v>

3137
02:18:10.090 --> 02:18:11.290
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's that?</v>

3138
02:18:11.440 --> 02:18:12.273
<v Speaker 4>Lombard street cricket,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a street in the world down near </v>

3139
02:18:14.681 --> 02:18:16.510
<v Speaker 4>Fisherman's wharf.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's a change.</v>

3140
02:18:16.820 --> 02:18:17.653
<v Speaker 4>This is the craziest shift.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean this was also during the Vietnam </v>

3141
02:18:20.740 --> 02:18:24.220
<v Speaker 4>war,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I went from being in this really sort</v>

3142
02:18:24.221 --> 02:18:25.054
<v Speaker 4>of repressive east coast Italian </v>
<v Speaker 4>Catholic environment to being around </v>

3143
02:18:29.890 --> 02:18:32.560
<v Speaker 4>nothing but hippies and gay people out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your mom wanted out?</v>

3144
02:18:32.950 --> 02:18:34.030
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

3145
02:18:34.060 --> 02:18:36.100
<v Speaker 4>Everybody wanted out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My stepdad wanted out,</v>

3146
02:18:36.101 --> 02:18:39.070
<v Speaker 4>my mom wanted out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They realized that there was also.</v>

3147
02:18:39.070 --> 02:18:42.190
<v Speaker 4>This was 1971.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was seven,</v>

3148
02:18:42.191 --> 02:18:45.790
<v Speaker 4>so it was 73,</v>
<v Speaker 4>74,</v>

3149
02:18:45.791 --> 02:18:46.624
<v Speaker 4>74.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it was like the heat of the Vietnam </v>

3150
02:18:49.700 --> 02:18:52.060
<v Speaker 4>War.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The hippie movement was in full swing.</v>

3151
02:18:52.420 --> 02:18:57.420
<v Speaker 4>Nixon I think was president.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was craziness back then and fuck,</v>

3152
02:18:58.061 --> 02:18:59.740
<v Speaker 4>everybody wanted out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

3153
02:18:59.770 --> 02:19:01.240
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have you listened to that?</v>

3154
02:19:01.270 --> 02:19:02.103
<v Speaker 4>There's a podcast called slow burn who </v>
<v Speaker 4>listened to see that it's all about </v>

3155
02:19:04.811 --> 02:19:05.644
<v Speaker 4>Watergate and it sort of from the angle </v>
<v Speaker 4>of like how it just took awhile to </v>

3156
02:19:08.711 --> 02:19:11.140
<v Speaker 4>unfold.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like it just like you're like,</v>

3157
02:19:11.141 --> 02:19:11.681
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

3158
02:19:11.681 --> 02:19:12.514
<v Speaker 4>Took it like this didn't happen </v>
<v Speaker 4>overnight because they were like the </v>

3159
02:19:14.610 --> 02:19:16.570
<v Speaker 4>Russia trump investigation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3160
02:19:16.580 --> 02:19:17.413
<v Speaker 4>It's like the slow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just like it's just slowly unfolding </v>

3161
02:19:20.230 --> 02:19:21.800
<v Speaker 4>piece by piece and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3162
02:19:21.810 --> 02:19:24.160
<v Speaker 4>overtime you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

3163
02:19:24.570 --> 02:19:27.800
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like these dominoes slowly fall.</v>

3164
02:19:27.801 --> 02:19:28.490
<v Speaker 4>And</v>

3165
02:19:28.490 --> 02:19:29.930
<v Speaker 2>in that one you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't,</v>

3166
02:19:29.970 --> 02:19:31.490
<v Speaker 2>I just didn't know that much about </v>
<v Speaker 2>Watergate,</v>

3167
02:19:31.491 --> 02:19:32.324
<v Speaker 2>but I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

3168
02:19:32.510 --> 02:19:33.343
<v Speaker 2>like the water could happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the election was five months later </v>

3169
02:19:36.291 --> 02:19:40.070
<v Speaker 2>and Nixon won in a landslide.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the country was like,</v>

3170
02:19:40.220 --> 02:19:41.270
<v Speaker 2>the country was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eh.</v>

3171
02:19:41.271 --> 02:19:43.820
<v Speaker 2>Watergate said it's not that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's nothing big deal.</v>

3172
02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:47.570
<v Speaker 2>And then it was another year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>year and a half before,</v>

3173
02:19:47.740 --> 02:19:50.320
<v Speaker 2>like he finally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>before he was impeached,</v>

3174
02:19:50.340 --> 02:19:53.030
<v Speaker 2>he took a while.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did not know that.</v>

3175
02:19:53.031 --> 02:19:53.864
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of,</v>

3176
02:19:53.900 --> 02:19:55.420
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it gets like,</v>

3177
02:19:55.850 --> 02:19:56.683
<v Speaker 2>it gets into some of the early stuff of </v>
<v Speaker 2>like Watergate and after Watergate and </v>

3178
02:19:59.991 --> 02:20:00.824
<v Speaker 2>all the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like sort of the beginning of what I </v>

3179
02:20:02.181 --> 02:20:03.014
<v Speaker 2>think became like legit legitimizing and</v>
<v Speaker 2>different versions of like conspiracy </v>

3180
02:20:06.741 --> 02:20:07.430
<v Speaker 2>theories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

3181
02:20:07.430 --> 02:20:09.160
<v Speaker 2>what's really going on here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Should,</v>

3182
02:20:09.170 --> 02:20:10.190
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>

3183
02:20:10.220 --> 02:20:12.920
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's 74 and he resigned,</v>

3184
02:20:13.670 --> 02:20:14.690
<v Speaker 2>but he was reelected.</v>

3185
02:20:14.750 --> 02:20:15.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was reelected.</v>

3186
02:20:15.771 --> 02:20:19.820
<v Speaker 2>Watergate had happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody had nobody thought about it after</v>

3187
02:20:19.821 --> 02:20:22.990
<v Speaker 2>his resignation was issued.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A controversial pardon by success.</v>

3188
02:20:23.660 --> 02:20:25.250
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly what Mike Pence is going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to do.</v>

3189
02:20:25.400 --> 02:20:26.233
<v Speaker 2>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You think you'll go down and you think </v>

3190
02:20:26.931 --> 02:20:28.230
<v Speaker 2>he'll get impeached?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

3191
02:20:28.660 --> 02:20:30.750
<v Speaker 2>I just thought that more a few months </v>
<v Speaker 2>ago now.</v>

3192
02:20:30.760 --> 02:20:31.593
<v Speaker 2>It feels like I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's so preposterous that as time rolls </v>

3193
02:20:35.961 --> 02:20:36.794
<v Speaker 2>on where we're conditioned to his </v>
<v Speaker 2>preposterousness just all of it loses </v>

3194
02:20:40.701 --> 02:20:42.330
<v Speaker 2>its teeth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

3195
02:20:42.650 --> 02:20:45.230
<v Speaker 2>I mean the stormy Daniels thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody gives a fuck about it anymore.</v>

3196
02:20:45.270 --> 02:20:45.550
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3197
02:20:45.550 --> 02:20:46.700
<v Speaker 2>I fucked her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what?</v>

3198
02:20:46.850 --> 02:20:47.541
<v Speaker 2>But I feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3199
02:20:47.541 --> 02:20:48.374
<v Speaker 2>I feel like they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody knew he was fucking people </v>

3200
02:20:49.491 --> 02:20:50.241
<v Speaker 2>before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

3201
02:20:50.241 --> 02:20:52.420
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you don't apply yourself to a,</v>

3202
02:20:52.910 --> 02:20:57.480
<v Speaker 2>a normal moral framework,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it's not like he was um,</v>

3203
02:20:57.890 --> 02:20:58.723
<v Speaker 2>super ethical guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like who was the guy that was running </v>

3204
02:21:00.621 --> 02:21:01.460
<v Speaker 2>for president?</v>

3205
02:21:02.840 --> 02:21:05.410
<v Speaker 2>And it turned out that he was chief John</v>
<v Speaker 2>Edwards.</v>

3206
02:21:05.420 --> 02:21:07.280
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>While she was dying of cancer,</v>

3207
02:21:07.281 --> 02:21:07.940
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3208
02:21:07.940 --> 02:21:10.280
<v Speaker 2>And he's having an affair or a baby with</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone.</v>

3209
02:21:10.390 --> 02:21:11.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's cook.</v>

3210
02:21:12.020 --> 02:21:12.853
<v Speaker 2>Well that's the problem with like when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you see like Al Franken go down for </v>

3211
02:21:15.651 --> 02:21:16.510
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3212
02:21:16.580 --> 02:21:17.750
<v Speaker 2>nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing.</v>

3213
02:21:18.050 --> 02:21:21.460
<v Speaker 2>And it's because on that side it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

3214
02:21:21.500 --> 02:21:24.410
<v Speaker 2>it's like the moral framework is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't do that to women,</v>

3215
02:21:24.650 --> 02:21:25.700
<v Speaker 2>but if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're,</v>

3216
02:21:25.890 --> 02:21:27.560
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're a trump guy,</v>

3217
02:21:28.100 --> 02:21:30.950
<v Speaker 2>then you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not if you're a trump guy.</v>

3218
02:21:30.951 --> 02:21:32.150
<v Speaker 2>But it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

3219
02:21:32.151 --> 02:21:33.620
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's how Donald is,</v>

3220
02:21:33.640 --> 02:21:34.341
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

3221
02:21:34.341 --> 02:21:35.480
<v Speaker 2>and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's how I am.</v>

3222
02:21:35.550 --> 02:21:39.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if below Riley was taking pictures of</v>

3223
02:21:39.241 --> 02:21:41.390
<v Speaker 2>the chicken grab there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but everybody would go,</v>

3224
02:21:41.420 --> 02:21:42.253
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3225
02:21:42.440 --> 02:21:43.330
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3226
02:21:43.460 --> 02:21:44.930
<v Speaker 2>But it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it's on the other side,</v>

3227
02:21:44.931 --> 02:21:45.764
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well there's a moral framework there </v>

3228
02:21:46.461 --> 02:21:47.360
<v Speaker 2>that you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck,</v>

3229
02:21:47.361 --> 02:21:47.960
<v Speaker 2>we got to.</v>

3230
02:21:47.960 --> 02:21:49.550
<v Speaker 2>If we're going to say that that's the </v>
<v Speaker 2>deal.</v>

3231
02:21:49.551 --> 02:21:51.380
<v Speaker 2>Then we have to follow through that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the deal.</v>

3232
02:21:51.610 --> 02:21:54.680

<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3235
02:21:56.990 --> 02:21:57.823
<v Speaker 2>this would be great for two coasts </v>
<v Speaker 2>proposing a three round mixed martial </v>

3236
02:21:59.901 --> 02:22:03.080
