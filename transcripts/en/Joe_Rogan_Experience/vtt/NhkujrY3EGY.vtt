00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:02.910
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches.</v>

2
00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:06.330
<v Speaker 1>I mean everybody has their moments of getting hot and then cold and you know,</v>

3
00:00:06.331 --> 00:00:08.010
<v Speaker 1>you've have to hope if you get cold,</v>

4
00:00:08.011 --> 00:00:08.491
<v Speaker 1>your head hot,</v>

5
00:00:08.491 --> 00:00:09.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6
00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:09.983
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>

7
00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:10.711
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

8
00:00:10.711 --> 00:00:11.544
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

9
00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:14.700
<v Speaker 1>it's really fucking stupid.</v>

10
00:00:14.701 --> 00:00:15.230
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

11
00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:17.790
<v Speaker 1>like during that whole Chris Brown thing,</v>

12
00:00:17.791 --> 00:00:19.720
<v Speaker 1>that's my only example.</v>

13
00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:24.570
<v Speaker 1>So of course I was getting invited to be on shows and talk about it and I</v>

14
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:25.620
<v Speaker 1>declined to everything.</v>

15
00:00:25.621 --> 00:00:25.921
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

16
00:00:25.921 --> 00:00:26.610
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

17
00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:27.840
<v Speaker 1>I'm not good for you.</v>

18
00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:28.141
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

19
00:00:28.141 --> 00:00:28.831
<v Speaker 1>absolutely not.</v>

20
00:00:28.831 --> 00:00:29.910
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't the Chris Brown things.</v>

21
00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:31.380
<v Speaker 1>We talked about it before the podcast,</v>

22
00:00:31.381 --> 00:00:36.300
<v Speaker 1>but if people don't know Chris Brown obviously was in trouble because was beat</v>

23
00:00:36.301 --> 00:00:41.301
<v Speaker 1>up or Yana and that whole thing and you know the domestic violence issue and you</v>

24
00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.530
<v Speaker 1>tweeted something at him.</v>

25
00:00:43.531 --> 00:00:44.364
<v Speaker 1>What did you tweet?</v>

26
00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:49.540
<v Speaker 1>It was like my lowest form of comedy writing is the celebrity reach weight.</v>

27
00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.610
<v Speaker 1>It's because I can't think of anything else and I'll just go to my favorite</v>

28
00:00:53.611 --> 00:00:57.540
<v Speaker 1>targets like Hammer Kim Kardashians and I only make fun of when they write</v>

29
00:00:57.541 --> 00:00:58.290
<v Speaker 1>something stupid.</v>

30
00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:58.861
<v Speaker 1>I never,</v>

31
00:00:58.861 --> 00:01:02.520
<v Speaker 1>I never ever like I've never talked about some of these looks their weight.</v>

32
00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:03.460
<v Speaker 1>There you know,</v>

33
00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.750
<v Speaker 1>like it's just when something dumb and with his,</v>

34
00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:07.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

35
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.621
<v Speaker 1>what he did,</v>

36
00:01:07.621 --> 00:01:10.860
<v Speaker 1>he's a horrible person and he had showed no signs of remorse.</v>

37
00:01:10.861 --> 00:01:12.240
<v Speaker 1>Like he kept doing shit,</v>

38
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:13.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

39
00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.090
<v Speaker 1>threw a chair through the window and good morning America when Robin Roberts</v>

40
00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:17.063
<v Speaker 1>interviewed him.</v>

41
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:17.431
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

42
00:01:17.431 --> 00:01:20.910
<v Speaker 1>Well I mean like asking him about it and apparently they had made some sort of</v>

43
00:01:20.911 --> 00:01:23.430
<v Speaker 1>an agreement where they weren't going to bring up domestic violence.</v>

44
00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:24.660
<v Speaker 1>I'm here to talk about my album,</v>

45
00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:26.371
<v Speaker 1>but the whole thing is,</v>

46
00:01:26.371 --> 00:01:28.260
<v Speaker 1>it's like how he channeled his rage,</v>

47
00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.440
<v Speaker 1>throwing a chair through a fucking window really,</v>

48
00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:31.320
<v Speaker 1>like you couldn't.</v>

49
00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:36.720
<v Speaker 1>So I was born child and so I was born and he had tweeted something like,</v>

50
00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:37.673
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

51
00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:38.071
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

52
00:01:38.071 --> 00:01:40.170
<v Speaker 1>I look old as fuck and I'm only 23.</v>

53
00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:42.060
<v Speaker 1>And so I retweeted it and I was like,</v>

54
00:01:42.061 --> 00:01:44.670
<v Speaker 1>I know being a worthless piece of shit can really aged person.</v>

55
00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:50.670
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was funny and then all of a sudden like I look at my replies on my</v>

56
00:01:50.671 --> 00:01:51.570
<v Speaker 1>phone and it was like,</v>

57
00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:53.190
<v Speaker 1>you don't look like that.</v>

58
00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.010
<v Speaker 1>The waterfall of just like,</v>

59
00:01:56.011 --> 00:01:57.720
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden it was like a thousand $2,000.</v>

60
00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:58.080
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

61
00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.913
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit,</v>

<v Speaker 1>whoops.</v>

63
00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.080
<v Speaker 1>What did I do?</v>

64
00:02:01.081 --> 00:02:06.081
<v Speaker 1>And then I realized he was coming back like telling me to suck his dick.</v>

65
00:02:06.091 --> 00:02:06.421
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

66
00:02:06.421 --> 00:02:06.750
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

67

<v Speaker 1>your mother must be.</v>

68
00:02:07.471 --> 00:02:08.190
<v Speaker 1>So like I just,</v>

69
00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.050
<v Speaker 1>I played with them.</v>

70
00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:10.111
<v Speaker 1>It was a Sunday.</v>

71
00:02:10.111 --> 00:02:13.890
<v Speaker 1>I was bored and like next thing I know is like he deleted his entire twitter</v>

72
00:02:13.891 --> 00:02:17.370
<v Speaker 1>account and I feel like wow,</v>

73
00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:18.600
<v Speaker 1>that's not what I meant to do.</v>

74
00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.020
<v Speaker 1>Did he say one of the shit in your mouth too short in my eye.</v>

75
00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.830
<v Speaker 1>Your eye retina to be</v>

76
00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:28.440
<v Speaker 1>specific.</v>

77
00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.981
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

78
00:02:28.981 --> 00:02:30.960
<v Speaker 1>I think he was trying to sound smart beam accuracy.</v>

79
00:02:30.961 --> 00:02:33.210
<v Speaker 1>Does he have with the is even the back of the eye?</v>

80
00:02:33.211 --> 00:02:33.561
<v Speaker 1>It's on,</v>

81
00:02:33.561 --> 00:02:33.931
<v Speaker 1>in the front,</v>

82
00:02:33.931 --> 00:02:34.764
<v Speaker 1>like he didn't even.</v>

83
00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:40.090
<v Speaker 1>I think it's just trying to sound smart and on your retina laughing away.</v>

84
00:02:40.771 --> 00:02:44.490
<v Speaker 1>And I like he said like ask Ron if she mad.</v>

85
00:02:44.491 --> 00:02:46.890
<v Speaker 1>I'm like ask Anna if she man.</v>

86
00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.970
<v Speaker 1>So like I tweeted back and then I linked his police report to that tweet is a.</v>

87
00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.960
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was funny and we went back and forth for awhile and then he deleted</v>

88
00:02:57.961 --> 00:03:00.340
<v Speaker 1>his account and that's when it a a thing.</v>

89
00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:01.270
<v Speaker 1>Did he put it back up?</v>

90
00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:02.500
<v Speaker 1>Is this back?</v>

91
00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:03.070

93
00:03:05.291 --> 00:03:07.570
<v Speaker 1>Can you delete your account when you put it back to you get all your followers</v>

<v Speaker 1>we get the view,</v>

136
00:03:54.401 --> 00:03:54.731
<v Speaker 1>and I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

<v Speaker 2>That's one way to do it,</v>

141
00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:59.790
<v Speaker 2>and I've definitely done that way before.</v>

142
00:03:59.791 --> 00:04:00.624
<v Speaker 2>I've done it.</v>

143
00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:01.411
<v Speaker 2>A bunch of shitty.</v>

144
00:04:01.411 --> 00:04:03.150
<v Speaker 2>What's the worst way you've ever done it?</v>

145
00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:05.850
<v Speaker 2>I've just got the chicken nuggets way,</v>

146
00:04:05.851 --> 00:04:08.640
<v Speaker 2>but right around that same time,</v>

147
00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:10.710
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>

148
00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:11.490
<v Speaker 2>not eating.</v>

149
00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:12.001
<v Speaker 2>I remember,</v>

150
00:04:12.001 --> 00:04:14.850
<v Speaker 2>so my first kickboxing fight ever.</v>

151
00:04:14.851 --> 00:04:16.200
<v Speaker 2>I fought a guy named Andy Sour.</v>

152
00:04:16.201 --> 00:04:17.710
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you're sure familiar with it.</v>

153
00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:18.540
<v Speaker 2>That was your first kick?</v>

154
00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:20.890
<v Speaker 2>My first kickboxing fight over fucking.</v>

155
00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:22.650
<v Speaker 2>Is that your manager?</v>

156
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.590
<v Speaker 2>How long has andy been fighting then?</v>

157
00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.380
<v Speaker 2>He is already his record at the time.</v>

158
00:04:28.381 --> 00:04:31.320
<v Speaker 2>I remember two and for some 93 in one.</v>

159
00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:32.910
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>

160
00:04:32.911 --> 00:04:34.130
<v Speaker 2>that's so insane.</v>

161
00:04:34.131 --> 00:04:36.930

164
00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.920
<v Speaker 2>As an MMA fighter.</v>

165
00:04:40.921 --> 00:04:41.980
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

166
00:04:41.981 --> 00:04:43.200
<v Speaker 2>I was 19 years old.</v>

167
00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:49.170
<v Speaker 2>I had maybe one or two amateur boxing fights and I had been training him or I'd</v>

168
00:04:49.171 --> 00:04:50.500
<v Speaker 2>been trying to kickboxing for lots on,</v>

169
00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:51.180
<v Speaker 2>but anyway,</v>

170
00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:52.800
<v Speaker 2>I go up to 91,</v>

171
00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:53.361

172
00:04:53.361 --> 00:04:54.120
<v Speaker 2>93 and one.</v>

173
00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:54.500
<v Speaker 2>I remember.</v>

174
00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:55.333
<v Speaker 2>Oh Man.</v>

175
00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:59.010
<v Speaker 2>What fucking governing body sanctioned that?</v>

176
00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.340
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

177
00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:00.173
<v Speaker 2>it was in Japan.</v>

178
00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:00.800
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

179
00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:01.420
<v Speaker 2>I was basically,</v>

180
00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:01.870
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

181
00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:03.960
<v Speaker 2>I was the guy in Japan.</v>

182
00:05:03.961 --> 00:05:04.560
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

183
00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.510
<v Speaker 2>I was the guy that they were bringing in for the slaughter.</v>

184
00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:07.940
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

185
00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:08.710
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

186
00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:11.100
<v Speaker 2>I show up out there and I'm only,</v>

187
00:05:11.101 --> 00:05:15.120
<v Speaker 2>I think I remember I was only like eight pounds out and we didn't know what the</v>

188
00:05:15.121 --> 00:05:17.730
<v Speaker 2>fuck we were doing with regards to the weight cut at the time.</v>

189
00:05:17.731 --> 00:05:18.564
<v Speaker 2>I was 19.</v>

190
00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:19.351
<v Speaker 2>And so I'm like,</v>

191
00:05:19.351 --> 00:05:19.950
<v Speaker 2>Oh shit.</v>

192
00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:21.690
<v Speaker 2>And I just stopped eating.</v>

193
00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:24.780
<v Speaker 2>I just didn't eat for about four days.</v>

194
00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:25.920
<v Speaker 2>Oh No.</v>

195
00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:27.840
<v Speaker 2>Oh No.</v>

196
00:05:27.841 --> 00:05:28.081
<v Speaker 2>That's.</v>

197
00:05:28.081 --> 00:05:28.830
<v Speaker 2>So meanwhile,</v>

198
00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:30.030
<v Speaker 2>eight pounds ain't shit.</v>

199
00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:31.513
<v Speaker 2>I'll do that.</v>

200
00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:32.281
<v Speaker 2>I'll do that.</v>

201
00:05:32.281 --> 00:05:32.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

202
00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:34.090
<v Speaker 2>The day before a crowd.</v>

203
00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:34.741
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

204
00:05:34.741 --> 00:05:35.311
<v Speaker 2>we're good.</v>

205
00:05:35.311 --> 00:05:35.640
<v Speaker 2>Yep,</v>

206
00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:36.331
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

207
00:05:36.331 --> 00:05:39.030
<v Speaker 2>Still still eating one of the sauna.</v>

208
00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:39.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

209
00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:40.383
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

210
00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:40.880
<v Speaker 2>God.</v>

211
00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:45.120
<v Speaker 2>And so I started myself for about four days and we check in your weight by</v>

212
00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:45.963
<v Speaker 2>starving yourself.</v>

213
00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:46.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

214
00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:47.281
<v Speaker 2>I think it was,</v>

215
00:05:47.281 --> 00:05:47.580
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

216
00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:48.091
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember.</v>

217
00:05:48.091 --> 00:05:48.924
<v Speaker 2>It's a long time ago,</v>

218
00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.810
<v Speaker 2>but it was same day weigh ins to.</v>

219
00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:52.830
<v Speaker 2>Oh Christ.</v>

220
00:05:52.831 --> 00:05:57.831
<v Speaker 2>I waited in the morning and then fall about maybe eight or nine hours later.</v>

221
00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:00.740
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

222
00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:01.770
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

223
00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:03.110
<v Speaker 2>I went five rounds with him.</v>

224
00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:03.860
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

225
00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:04.320
<v Speaker 2>I went,</v>

226
00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:04.661
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

227
00:06:04.661 --> 00:06:04.880
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

228
00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:05.020
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

229
00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:05.390
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

230
00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:05.761
<v Speaker 2>I got,</v>

231
00:06:05.761 --> 00:06:06.680
<v Speaker 2>I got my ass kicked,</v>

232
00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:07.723
<v Speaker 2>I got my ass kicked.</v>

233
00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:08.081
<v Speaker 2>But I,</v>

234
00:06:08.081 --> 00:06:10.190
<v Speaker 2>I learned a lot and I grew from the experience.</v>

235
00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:13.270
<v Speaker 2>The big</v>

236
00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:13.511
<v Speaker 3>one,</v>

237
00:06:13.511 --> 00:06:13.781
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

238
00:06:13.781 --> 00:06:15.790
<v Speaker 3>that the film addresses is the,</v>

239
00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:16.020
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

240
00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:17.110
<v Speaker 3>is the livestock,</v>

241
00:06:17.111 --> 00:06:17.301
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

242
00:06:17.301 --> 00:06:20.440
<v Speaker 3>that's what's got out of control and that's what's literally destroying and</v>

243
00:06:20.441 --> 00:06:21.640
<v Speaker 3>taking over the wildlife.</v>

244
00:06:21.641 --> 00:06:23.410
<v Speaker 3>So if you really concerned about wildlife,</v>

245
00:06:23.411 --> 00:06:24.850
<v Speaker 3>if you're real wildlife person,</v>

246
00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:28.030
<v Speaker 3>the last thing you do was not only consume,</v>

247
00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:29.320
<v Speaker 3>say factory farm,</v>

248
00:06:29.321 --> 00:06:30.730
<v Speaker 3>but that's the whole thing about our film.</v>

249
00:06:30.731 --> 00:06:32.080
<v Speaker 3>People think it's about factory farms.</v>

250
00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:33.760
<v Speaker 3>We don't even talk about factory farm.</v>

251
00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:35.500
<v Speaker 3>We talk about the grass fed beef,</v>

252
00:06:35.501 --> 00:06:36.760
<v Speaker 3>we talked about the organic,</v>

253
00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:38.960
<v Speaker 3>the organic free range,</v>

254
00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:41.890
<v Speaker 3>organic grass fed milk,</v>

255
00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:43.900
<v Speaker 3>and that's what's killing the wildlife.</v>

256
00:06:43.901 --> 00:06:45.450
<v Speaker 3>And that's the whole point of what we,</v>

257
00:06:45.451 --> 00:06:45.691
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

258
00:06:45.691 --> 00:06:45.911
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

259
00:06:45.911 --> 00:06:49.600
<v Speaker 3>we jumped past the factory farm because ironically for wildlife,</v>

260
00:06:49.601 --> 00:06:52.450
<v Speaker 3>if you care truly about wildlife and that's what they discussed.</v>

261
00:06:52.451 --> 00:06:55.900
<v Speaker 3>When we talk to any animal agriculture alliance,</v>

262
00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:56.681
<v Speaker 3>they say,</v>

263
00:06:56.681 --> 00:06:59.110
<v Speaker 3>they say people think we're living in somewhere 50 years ago,</v>

264
00:06:59.111 --> 00:06:59.741
<v Speaker 3>100 years ago,</v>

265
00:06:59.741 --> 00:07:00.101
<v Speaker 3>we're not,</v>

266
00:07:00.101 --> 00:07:02.140
<v Speaker 3>we're living in a place with 7 billion people.</v>

267
00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:05.770
<v Speaker 3>The only way to efficiently fee people who want to eat meat is to do,</v>

268
00:07:05.771 --> 00:07:06.880
<v Speaker 3>put them in factory farms,</v>

269
00:07:06.881 --> 00:07:07.691
<v Speaker 3>their factory firms,</v>

270
00:07:07.691 --> 00:07:08.524
<v Speaker 3>because they're efficient.</v>

271
00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:10.580
<v Speaker 3>They only take around two acres per cow.</v>

272
00:07:10.581 --> 00:07:12.010
<v Speaker 3>Whereas is the grass fed cow.</v>

273
00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:13.660
<v Speaker 3>You're talking about your buddy in Wisconsin,</v>

274
00:07:13.661 --> 00:07:14.680
<v Speaker 3>the guy in our film,</v>

275
00:07:14.681 --> 00:07:16.390
<v Speaker 3>he had cattle in Wisconsin.</v>

276
00:07:16.391 --> 00:07:18.310
<v Speaker 3>He said 50 acres.</v>

277
00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:20.950
<v Speaker 3>Fifty acres for one fucking cow.</v>

278
00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:21.911
<v Speaker 3>One cow.</v>

279
00:07:21.911 --> 00:07:23.050
<v Speaker 3>Fifty acres,</v>

280
00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:24.071
<v Speaker 3>50 acres.</v>

281
00:07:24.071 --> 00:07:25.150
<v Speaker 3>Think how big that is.</v>

282
00:07:25.151 --> 00:07:26.770
<v Speaker 3>No other wildlife can enter that.</v>

283
00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:29.470
<v Speaker 3>So that's the last thing you'd want to eat is grass fed beef.</v>

284
00:07:29.471 --> 00:07:31.440
<v Speaker 3>The last thing you wanted to be fed is,</v>

285
00:07:31.441 --> 00:07:32.080
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

286
00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:36.760
<v Speaker 3>would beating as these organic dairy farms that is destroying all our water,</v>

287
00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:37.900
<v Speaker 3>water resources,</v>

288
00:07:37.901 --> 00:07:40.630
<v Speaker 3>polluting the rivers and destroying all these predators.</v>

289
00:07:40.631 --> 00:07:41.111
<v Speaker 3>And these,</v>

290
00:07:41.111 --> 00:07:41.500
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

291
00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:41.711
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

292
00:07:41.711 --> 00:07:43.060
<v Speaker 3>the other wildlife that you talked about,</v>

293
00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:47.050
<v Speaker 3>but the argument would be that when you have a grass fed cow and it's eating on</v>

294
00:07:47.051 --> 00:07:47.831
<v Speaker 3>50 acres,</v>

295
00:07:47.831 --> 00:07:49.390
<v Speaker 3>that's where it's getting its food from.</v>

296
00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:52.960
<v Speaker 3>Whereas if you have a factory raised animals getting corn and that corn has</v>

297
00:07:52.961 --> 00:07:55.390
<v Speaker 3>raised independently on some other large area,</v>

298
00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:56.160
<v Speaker 3>two acres,</v>

299
00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:56.993
<v Speaker 3>two acres,</v>

300
00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:58.110
<v Speaker 3>two acres to.</v>

301
00:07:58.111 --> 00:07:58.270
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

302
00:07:58.270 --> 00:08:01.960
<v Speaker 3>because you can grow a corn so much prager and grass fed,</v>

303
00:08:01.961 --> 00:08:04.060
<v Speaker 3>it needs 50 acres that no other horse,</v>

304
00:08:04.061 --> 00:08:04.751
<v Speaker 3>no other bear,</v>

305
00:08:04.751 --> 00:08:07.900
<v Speaker 3>no other cougar know that all these animals that you're talking about,</v>

306
00:08:07.901 --> 00:08:10.060
<v Speaker 3>no other animal can live on that area.</v>

307
00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:11.590
<v Speaker 3>Is that during the life of the animal?</v>

308
00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:11.920
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

309
00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:12.641
<v Speaker 3>that's just period.</v>

310
00:08:12.641 --> 00:08:13.474
<v Speaker 3>That's just water.</v>

311
00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:15.790
<v Speaker 3>Water that's constantly.</v>

312
00:08:15.791 --> 00:08:17.410
<v Speaker 3>So imagine on a 50 foot fence.</v>

313
00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:22.600
<v Speaker 3>Nothing else was way more than 50 foot 50 slash 50 acres or 50 acres for one.</v>

314
00:08:22.601 --> 00:08:25.750
<v Speaker 3>So that's the last thing you want to be eating is grassfed beef.</v>

315
00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:27.430
<v Speaker 3>If you really care about the environment,</v>

316
00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:28.900
<v Speaker 3>if you really care about wildlife,</v>

317
00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:29.480
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

318
00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:31.750
<v Speaker 3>you need to say either our fuck the cow,</v>

319
00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:32.710
<v Speaker 3>screw the cow,</v>

320
00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:34.510
<v Speaker 3>the cow lives a miserable life.</v>

321
00:08:34.511 --> 00:08:34.811
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

322
00:08:34.811 --> 00:08:36.520
<v Speaker 3>I care a lot about more like a,</v>

323
00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:36.821
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

324
00:08:36.821 --> 00:08:37.490
<v Speaker 3>about the,</v>

325
00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:39.760
<v Speaker 3>the elk and the Moose and the wolves.</v>

326
00:08:39.761 --> 00:08:42.340
<v Speaker 3>I care more about wildlife than I do about this cow.</v>

327
00:08:42.550 --> 00:08:44.380
<v Speaker 3>You got to choose one or the other if you're going to do it.</v>

328
00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:46.150
<v Speaker 3>And if you really care about wildlife,</v>

329
00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:48.070
<v Speaker 3>you got to say screw the cow.</v>

330
00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:48.770
<v Speaker 3>And then Sco,</v>

331
00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:49.260
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

332
00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:50.150
<v Speaker 3>with factory farm.</v>

333
00:08:50.151 --> 00:08:55.151
<v Speaker 3>And that's the whole irony of this whole grass fed myth that's happening and</v>

334
00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:55.680
<v Speaker 3>what's,</v>

335
00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:57.830
<v Speaker 3>that's what's kind of ironic about the film.</v>

336
00:08:57.831 --> 00:08:59.400
<v Speaker 3>And people don't expect that shocking.</v>
