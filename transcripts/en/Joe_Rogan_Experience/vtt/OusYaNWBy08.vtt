00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:05.370
<v Speaker 1>Did your room experience podcast is brought to you by tank.</v>

2
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.400
<v Speaker 1>If you go to [inaudible] dot [inaudible] dot com you will save 25 bucks off of</v>

3
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.340
<v Speaker 1>any of their high end cell phones or service.</v>

4
00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:15.450
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

5
00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:16.500
<v Speaker 1>if you have not,</v>

6
00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:17.030
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

7
00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:20.040
<v Speaker 1>if you're not aware of what Ting is we've talked about on this podcast,</v>

8
00:00:20.041 --> 00:00:25.041
<v Speaker 1>many times the only people that will ever do commercials for are people whose</v>

9
00:00:25.051 --> 00:00:27.060
<v Speaker 1>companies make sense to us.</v>

10
00:00:27.061 --> 00:00:31.470
<v Speaker 1>People whose companies like if they have like a good ethic to them or if they're</v>

11
00:00:31.471 --> 00:00:32.910
<v Speaker 1>selling something that's really cool.</v>

12
00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.340
<v Speaker 1>That's the only people that were interested in getting involved in.</v>

13
00:00:35.341 --> 00:00:38.850
<v Speaker 1>And we got involved with Ting because they're what I would call a non evil</v>

14
00:00:38.851 --> 00:00:39.360
<v Speaker 1>company.</v>

15
00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.750
<v Speaker 1>Their approach is you don't need to have contracts,</v>

16
00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.020
<v Speaker 1>just give people a decent service at a reasonable rate and you're gonna,</v>

17
00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.081
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna make money.</v>

18
00:00:49.081 --> 00:00:49.500
<v Speaker 1>You don't,</v>

19
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.810
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to make more money and be a cunt.</v>

20
00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.760
<v Speaker 1>And that's sort of the idea behind it.</v>

21
00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.740
<v Speaker 1>You can quit anytime you want.</v>

22
00:00:55.741 --> 00:00:57.120
<v Speaker 1>It's on the sprint backbone.</v>

23
00:00:57.121 --> 00:00:59.450
<v Speaker 1>So it's a legitimate high end,</v>

24
00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:00.390
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

25
00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.470
<v Speaker 1>broadband service and the legitimate high end cellular connection.</v>

26
00:01:04.471 --> 00:01:05.820
<v Speaker 1>So it's not like it's,</v>

27
00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:06.391
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

28
00:01:06.391 --> 00:01:08.970
<v Speaker 1>Bob cell phone companies making his own wires.</v>

29
00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:09.990
<v Speaker 1>They use sprint.</v>

30
00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.230
<v Speaker 1>So what you're getting is all of the,</v>

31
00:01:13.231 --> 00:01:13.591
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

32
00:01:13.591 --> 00:01:13.831
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

33
00:01:13.831 --> 00:01:15.690
<v Speaker 1>the power of a big network,</v>

34
00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:16.751
<v Speaker 1>but with all,</v>

35
00:01:16.751 --> 00:01:17.790
<v Speaker 1>and not all the bullshit.</v>

36
00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.210
<v Speaker 1>You can have a couple people on the same account and share minutes if your</v>

37
00:01:21.211 --> 00:01:21.930
<v Speaker 1>minutes,</v>

38
00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.370
<v Speaker 1>if you don't use your minutes,</v>

39
00:01:23.371 --> 00:01:25.290
<v Speaker 1>you get credited and your next account,</v>

40
00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.840
<v Speaker 1>no one is trying to fuck you over at this company.</v>

41
00:01:27.841 --> 00:01:30.690
<v Speaker 1>And that's what we like about them and that's why,</v>

42
00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.900
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

43
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:31.860
<v Speaker 1>we represent them.</v>

44
00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.030
<v Speaker 1>So go to rogan.ting.com and save yourself 25 bucks.</v>

45
00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.520
<v Speaker 1>We'll also brought to you by brought to you.</v>

46
00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:39.540
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

47
00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.930
<v Speaker 1>we're also brought to you by blade slinger from kerosene games.</v>

48
00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.620
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

49
00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:46.230
<v Speaker 1>if you've never played any games on the IPAD,</v>

50
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.100
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that can be really annoying is if a game is not designed for</v>

51
00:01:50.101 --> 00:01:50.791
<v Speaker 1>the IPAD,</v>

52
00:01:50.791 --> 00:01:52.590
<v Speaker 1>if it's like poured it over for a computer,</v>

53
00:01:52.591 --> 00:01:54.540
<v Speaker 1>then it's like the controls are all fucked.</v>

54
00:01:54.541 --> 00:01:54.691
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

55
00:01:54.691 --> 00:01:55.261
<v Speaker 1>they're clunky.</v>

56
00:01:55.261 --> 00:01:55.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

57
00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:56.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

58
00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.100
<v Speaker 1>This is designed specifically for IPADS and iPhones.</v>

59
00:02:00.101 --> 00:02:03.620
<v Speaker 1>And one of the cool things about living in today's era is that you,</v>

60
00:02:03.621 --> 00:02:07.920
<v Speaker 1>you get amazing visual processing power from these little tablets,</v>

61
00:02:07.921 --> 00:02:11.820
<v Speaker 1>like something that would be a giant computer just a few years ago,</v>

62
00:02:11.821 --> 00:02:16.821
<v Speaker 1>just 10 years ago is now a little thin glass and metal piece of awesomeness.</v>

63
00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.320
<v Speaker 1>And you can play this game on it and it's,</v>

64
00:02:19.321 --> 00:02:19.651
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

65
00:02:19.651 --> 00:02:21.930
<v Speaker 1>really high resolution graphics.</v>

66
00:02:21.931 --> 00:02:26.931
<v Speaker 1>It's a super cool game and it's only two 99 and you can get it on iTunes and it</v>

67
00:02:27.961 --> 00:02:31.170
<v Speaker 1>will be available very soon for high end android devices.</v>

68
00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.280
<v Speaker 1>They're shooting for February,</v>

69
00:02:32.281 --> 00:02:33.114
<v Speaker 1>I believe.</v>

70
00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.290
<v Speaker 1>But it's a very cool game.</v>

71
00:02:34.291 --> 00:02:37.080
<v Speaker 1>If you go and look at the reviews online,</v>

72
00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.610
<v Speaker 1>it's amazingly positive,</v>

73
00:02:38.611 --> 00:02:41.460
<v Speaker 1>which is incredible because the universe is filled with clients.</v>

74
00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.280
<v Speaker 1>So if you can get that many positive reviews,</v>

75
00:02:44.281 --> 00:02:46.710
<v Speaker 1>you know that someone's doing something right because,</v>

76
00:02:46.711 --> 00:02:47.040
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

77
00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.341
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

78
00:02:47.341 --> 00:02:48.300
<v Speaker 1>it's a fun game to play.</v>

79
00:02:48.301 --> 00:02:49.134
<v Speaker 1>It's very addictive.</v>

80
00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:50.400
<v Speaker 1>So it's called Blade slinger.</v>

81
00:02:50.401 --> 00:02:52.170
<v Speaker 1>It's on kerosene games and it's three bucks.</v>

82
00:02:52.171 --> 00:02:52.830
<v Speaker 1>You fucks.</v>

83
00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:53.460
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

84
00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:54.293
<v Speaker 1>Get it together.</v>

85
00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.571
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

86
00:02:54.571 --> 00:02:57.750
<v Speaker 1>We're also brought to you by [inaudible] dot com I was going to bring in,</v>

87
00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:58.380
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

88
00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.130
<v Speaker 1>a gift pack for our buddy.</v>

89
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.760
<v Speaker 1>I'm here,</v>

90
00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.980
<v Speaker 1>Alex Honnold but uh,</v>

91
00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:04.540
<v Speaker 1>but I forgot it unfortunately.</v>

92
00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:05.231
<v Speaker 1>But on it,</v>

93
00:03:05.231 --> 00:03:06.490
<v Speaker 1>if you're interested,</v>

94
00:03:06.491 --> 00:03:07.540
<v Speaker 1>we'll send you a bunch of shit.</v>

95
00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.130
<v Speaker 1>It's a supplement company that,</v>

96
00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.431
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

97
00:03:09.431 --> 00:03:10.570
<v Speaker 1>I'm a part of a,</v>

98
00:03:10.571 --> 00:03:11.560
<v Speaker 1>I own a piece of it.</v>

99
00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:16.480
<v Speaker 1>And the reason why I got involved with it was exactly what I said earlier about</v>

100
00:03:16.481 --> 00:03:17.314
<v Speaker 1>commercials.</v>

101
00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.490
<v Speaker 1>The idea of selling something to someone where you know,</v>

102
00:03:21.491 --> 00:03:24.820
<v Speaker 1>it's not a rip off the idea of like a reasonable exchange.</v>

103
00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.000
<v Speaker 1>Instead of having the ethics of business that a lot of people have where you're</v>

104
00:03:28.001 --> 00:03:32.170
<v Speaker 1>just trying to squeeze every last ounce of profit,</v>

105
00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:37.330
<v Speaker 1>our idea is to sell the best shit we can find as cheaply as we can.</v>

106
00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:42.800
<v Speaker 1>We will sell you all of the cool food items that I've gotten into that we've</v>

107
00:03:43.691 --> 00:03:44.710
<v Speaker 1>talked about on the podcast,</v>

108
00:03:44.711 --> 00:03:46.120
<v Speaker 1>including bulletproof coffee,</v>

109
00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:47.800
<v Speaker 1>which I'm treating right now.</v>

110
00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:48.490
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

111
00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:52.240
<v Speaker 1>that's why sometimes like that's one of the side effects of bulletproof</v>

112
00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.601
<v Speaker 2>coffee.</v>

113
00:03:52.601 --> 00:03:54.210
<v Speaker 2>The fact that the butternut goobers</v>

114
00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.471
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

115
00:03:54.471 --> 00:03:56.630
<v Speaker 1>I got goobers I get a little bit cotton mouth too,</v>

116
00:03:56.631 --> 00:03:57.464
<v Speaker 1>if you know what I'm saying.</v>

117
00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:58.820
<v Speaker 1>This bulletproof coffee,</v>

118
00:03:58.821 --> 00:03:59.840
<v Speaker 1>if you're not aware,</v>

119
00:03:59.841 --> 00:04:02.840
<v Speaker 1>and this is a fascinating thing that I've just become aware of,</v>

120
00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:07.100
<v Speaker 1>there's a real issue with foods with something called mycotoxins.</v>

121
00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:08.870
<v Speaker 1>Mycotoxins are,</v>

122
00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:12.200
<v Speaker 1>is when you get coffee and uh,</v>

123
00:04:12.201 --> 00:04:12.591
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

124
00:04:12.591 --> 00:04:16.400
<v Speaker 1>and you don't know how it was taken care of or it's even in corn number and</v>

125
00:04:16.401 --> 00:04:17.234
<v Speaker 1>reading.</v>

126
00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:21.980
<v Speaker 1>What happens is if it's stored incorrectly or harvested under certain conditions</v>

127
00:04:21.981 --> 00:04:26.510
<v Speaker 1>that can develop fungus and that fungus can actually be toxic for your body.</v>

128
00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:28.520
<v Speaker 1>So if you're drinking coffee like,</v>

129
00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:30.260
<v Speaker 1>oh I feel like shit me,</v>

130
00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:32.480
<v Speaker 1>you might have just poisoned herself.</v>

131
00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:35.710
<v Speaker 2>And right now at this list just Starbucks,</v>

132
00:04:35.711 --> 00:04:37.690
<v Speaker 2>Dave Asprey is actually doing research,</v>

133
00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:37.961
<v Speaker 1>John,</v>

134
00:04:37.961 --> 00:04:42.490
<v Speaker 1>all this stuff to try to find out exactly what the effects are,</v>

135
00:04:42.491 --> 00:04:43.540
<v Speaker 1>how prevalent they are.</v>

136
00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:45.250
<v Speaker 1>But they have absolutely been measured.</v>

137
00:04:45.251 --> 00:04:46.001
<v Speaker 1>This is a fact.</v>

138
00:04:46.001 --> 00:04:51.001
<v Speaker 1>There's a show called dangerous grounds where a guy is a coffee expert.</v>

139
00:04:51.401 --> 00:04:54.250
<v Speaker 1>He goes to all these different really exotic parts of the world where they</v>

140
00:04:54.251 --> 00:04:55.150
<v Speaker 1>cultivate coffee.</v>

141
00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:56.380
<v Speaker 1>Cause a lot of the coffee that you buy,</v>

142
00:04:56.381 --> 00:04:58.420
<v Speaker 1>like my favorite stuff comes from Hawaii,</v>

143
00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:02.330
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of coffee comes from like really fucking freaky places I guess.</v>

144
00:05:02.331 --> 00:05:02.400
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

145
00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:02.490
<v Speaker 1>it</v>

146
00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:03.030
<v Speaker 2>grows better.</v>

147
00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:06.210
<v Speaker 2>This you get to the bottom of this because I live right next door to a Starbucks</v>

148
00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:07.950
<v Speaker 2>like every single day I go there,</v>

149
00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:09.330
<v Speaker 2>everybody knows you at.</v>

150
00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:12.270
<v Speaker 2>When do we would have to do as far as test test their coffee.</v>

151
00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:15.030
<v Speaker 2>You could test my fucking ball sweat and it's,</v>

152
00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:18.240
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's probably off your ball.</v>

153
00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.140
<v Speaker 2>That would be the,</v>

154
00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:22.620
<v Speaker 2>you are the most unscientific person ever because who knows what kind of toxins</v>

155
00:05:22.621 --> 00:05:23.580
<v Speaker 2>are going into your body.</v>

156
00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:27.320
<v Speaker 2>It's not like your buddies up purity filter springwater comes out of it isn't</v>

157
00:05:27.321 --> 00:05:31.590
<v Speaker 2>that way by getting rid of the toxins you to find out if you're getting it from</v>

158
00:05:31.591 --> 00:05:32.570
<v Speaker 2>Starbucks because we wouldn't,</v>

159
00:05:32.571 --> 00:05:35.910
<v Speaker 2>we'd have to only feed you Starbucks for that scientific project to work.</v>

160
00:05:35.911 --> 00:05:36.031
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

161
00:05:36.031 --> 00:05:40.170
<v Speaker 2>I don't eat or do anything except a Trenta Starbucks for the first six hours I'm</v>

162
00:05:40.171 --> 00:05:40.800
<v Speaker 2>awake.</v>

163
00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:41.760
<v Speaker 2>We'll do you shit.</v>

164
00:05:41.761 --> 00:05:43.890
<v Speaker 2>You've eaten the last couple of weeks could turn up in your,</v>

165
00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:44.813
<v Speaker 2>in your system.</v>

166
00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:46.140
<v Speaker 2>That's why people fail.</v>

167
00:05:46.141 --> 00:05:46.681
<v Speaker 2>Drug tests,</v>

168
00:05:46.681 --> 00:05:47.460
<v Speaker 2>dummy.</v>

169
00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:48.293
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

170
00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:48.740
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

171
00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:48.930
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

172
00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:50.010
<v Speaker 2>the point being,</v>

173
00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:54.510
<v Speaker 2>there's a big difference between coffee that has been cultivated from a single</v>

174
00:05:54.511 --> 00:05:56.130
<v Speaker 2>source and process.</v>

175
00:05:56.131 --> 00:05:58.100
<v Speaker 2>The way this stuff's process and we sell it cheaper</v>

176
00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:58.940
<v Speaker 3>than he does.</v>

177
00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:01.310
<v Speaker 3>If I'm getting poisoned by Starbucks this whole time,</v>

178
00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:02.360
<v Speaker 3>I really think people are,</v>

179
00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:03.380
<v Speaker 3>I really do because I,</v>

180
00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:06.860
<v Speaker 3>I drank some Starbucks this weekend and I'm not talking shit on Starbucks.</v>

181
00:06:06.861 --> 00:06:07.611
<v Speaker 3>I like Starbucks.</v>

182
00:06:07.611 --> 00:06:08.450
<v Speaker 3>I drink it all the time.</v>

183
00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:09.330
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

184
00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:09.560
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

185
00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:10.010
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't,</v>

186
00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:10.970
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't taste as good.</v>

187
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.020
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't feel as good.</v>

188
00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:13.670
<v Speaker 3>My body feels different when I drink it.</v>

189
00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:14.450
<v Speaker 3>I think I,</v>

190
00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:15.830
<v Speaker 3>I think it's not their fault.</v>

191
00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:18.170
<v Speaker 3>I think it's something that people are just not that aware of.</v>

192
00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:19.850
<v Speaker 3>And I think people have to be aware of it.</v>

193
00:06:19.851 --> 00:06:20.091
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

194
00:06:20.091 --> 00:06:24.200
<v Speaker 3>this is a legitimate issue with things that you can't see that are on your food</v>

195
00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:25.490
<v Speaker 3>that can really fuck you up.</v>

196
00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:26.100
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

197
00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:26.331
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

198
00:06:26.331 --> 00:06:26.461
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

199
00:06:26.461 --> 00:06:27.950
<v Speaker 3>we know there's poisons out there.</v>

200
00:06:27.951 --> 00:06:29.330
<v Speaker 3>We know there's poison mushrooms.</v>

201
00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:29.991
<v Speaker 3>I don't know why.</v>

202
00:06:29.991 --> 00:06:34.610
<v Speaker 3>It's just surprise people that some fungus that grows on some food is really</v>

203
00:06:34.611 --> 00:06:35.600
<v Speaker 3>fucking shitty for you.</v>

204
00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:37.340
<v Speaker 3>This is the tower seven of coffee.</v>

205
00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:38.213
<v Speaker 3>It's not,</v>

206
00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:40.820
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of science on mycotoxins says no,</v>

207
00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:41.900
<v Speaker 3>it's no tower seven.</v>

208
00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:42.950
<v Speaker 3>It's a fact.</v>

209
00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:45.530
<v Speaker 3>If you go and look at mycotoxins on corn,</v>

210
00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:46.760
<v Speaker 3>it's really kind of creepy.</v>

211
00:06:46.761 --> 00:06:47.240
<v Speaker 3>Men.</v>

212
00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:49.160
<v Speaker 3>Corn is fucking terrible for you,</v>

213
00:06:49.161 --> 00:06:49.660
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

214
00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:52.880
<v Speaker 3>Well that means we're all poison like corn syrup and all that shit.</v>

215
00:06:52.881 --> 00:06:55.490
<v Speaker 3>You're probably getting a little bit a negligible,</v>

216
00:06:55.491 --> 00:06:57.980
<v Speaker 3>a little bit of a toxins with that shit as well.</v>

217
00:06:59.240 --> 00:06:59.870
<v Speaker 3>Jesus.</v>

218
00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:00.230
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

219
00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:01.340
<v Speaker 3>Well you can just Google it.</v>

220
00:07:01.341 --> 00:07:02.121
<v Speaker 3>It's really interesting.</v>

221
00:07:02.121 --> 00:07:02.870
<v Speaker 3>I might be wrong.</v>

222
00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:03.980
<v Speaker 3>They might be blown with the science.</v>

223
00:07:03.981 --> 00:07:04.814
<v Speaker 3>Might be all horseshit.</v>

224
00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:05.950
<v Speaker 3>They might've made it up just to,</v>

225
00:07:05.951 --> 00:07:08.780
<v Speaker 3>to go after the corn industry because someone fucks someone's wife.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Very nice to meet you in person and a very nice to have you here on the show and</v>

301
00:09:10.481 --> 00:09:14.550
<v Speaker 1>I'm super psyched that you decided to come and join us because I watched one of</v>

302
00:09:14.551 --> 00:09:15.061
<v Speaker 1>your videos,</v>

303
00:09:15.061 --> 00:09:18.480
<v Speaker 1>I've seen several of them on the line for folks who don't know Alex is what you</v>

304
00:09:18.481 --> 00:09:19.860
<v Speaker 1>call a free solo climber.</v>

305
00:09:19.861 --> 00:09:20.700
<v Speaker 1>Is that how you would describe it?</v>

306
00:09:20.701 --> 00:09:20.821
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

307
00:09:20.821 --> 00:09:21.654
<v Speaker 1>you could say that.</v>

308
00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:22.170
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

309
00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:22.530
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

310
00:09:22.530 --> 00:09:27.530
<v Speaker 1>and he essentially climbs gigantic scary mountains with no aid.</v>

311
00:09:28.010 --> 00:09:28.390
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

312
00:09:28.390 --> 00:09:29.370
<v Speaker 1>you don't have ropes,</v>

313
00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:31.440
<v Speaker 1>you just climate with your hands and your feet.</v>

314
00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:32.460
<v Speaker 1>And I mean occasionally,</v>

315
00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:33.773
<v Speaker 1>occasionally,</v>

316
00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:35.960
<v Speaker 1>well you in that car with ropes,</v>

317
00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:37.120
<v Speaker 1>that's just special occasions,</v>

318
00:09:37.121 --> 00:09:37.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

319
00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:38.520
<v Speaker 1>but you do it a lot.</v>

320
00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:40.590
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's a lot of videos of you doing this.</v>

321
00:09:40.591 --> 00:09:42.600
<v Speaker 1>You say an occasionally for the average human being,</v>

322
00:09:42.601 --> 00:09:43.460
<v Speaker 1>if they did something like that,</v>

323
00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:47.550
<v Speaker 1>they would sit around the campfire kids grandpa's I tell you about how he</v>

324
00:09:47.551 --> 00:09:51.000
<v Speaker 1>climbed a mountain with his bare hands and everybody would go on and on about</v>

325
00:09:51.001 --> 00:09:51.091
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

326
00:09:51.091 --> 00:09:53.310
<v Speaker 1>Like it was a once in a lifetime and insane,</v>

327
00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:54.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

328
00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:55.830
<v Speaker 1>death defying event.</v>

329
00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:57.180
<v Speaker 1>How many times have you done it?</v>

330
00:09:57.940 --> 00:09:58.211
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

331
00:09:58.211 --> 00:09:59.860
<v Speaker 5>how many times did I say three solo climbed?</v>

332
00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:00.251
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

333
00:10:00.251 --> 00:10:01.084
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

334
00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:02.080
<v Speaker 5>it depends on how hard,</v>

335
00:10:02.081 --> 00:10:02.531
<v Speaker 5>you know what I mean?</v>

336
00:10:02.531 --> 00:10:03.231
<v Speaker 5>A free soul,</v>

337
00:10:03.231 --> 00:10:04.150
<v Speaker 5>easy routes all the time.</v>

338
00:10:04.151 --> 00:10:04.984
<v Speaker 5>But,</v>

339
00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:05.681
<v Speaker 5>but you know,</v>

340
00:10:05.681 --> 00:10:07.240
<v Speaker 5>the big hard ones that you've seen videos of,</v>

341
00:10:07.241 --> 00:10:07.451
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

342
00:10:07.451 --> 00:10:08.560
<v Speaker 5>that's a little more infrequent.</v>

343
00:10:09.250 --> 00:10:11.020
<v Speaker 5>Have you ever had a close call?</v>

344
00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:12.551
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

345
00:10:12.551 --> 00:10:13.800
<v Speaker 5>it all depends what you call it.</v>

346
00:10:13.810 --> 00:10:14.351
<v Speaker 5>Close Call,</v>

347
00:10:14.351 --> 00:10:15.120
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

348
00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:15.370
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

349
00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:15.611
<v Speaker 5>but no,</v>

350
00:10:15.611 --> 00:10:17.560
<v Speaker 5>I haven't had any like serious accidents or anything.</v>

351
00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:17.831
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

352
00:10:17.831 --> 00:10:19.390
<v Speaker 5>have you ever had a moment where you're like,</v>

353
00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:20.890
<v Speaker 5>oh shit like this,</v>

354
00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:22.930
<v Speaker 5>this could be a problem?</v>

355
00:10:23.770 --> 00:10:24.580
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

356
00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:26.380
<v Speaker 5>well I mean certainly some moments where you're like,</v>

357
00:10:26.410 --> 00:10:26.860
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

358
00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:28.060
<v Speaker 5>this could become a problem.</v>

359
00:10:28.510 --> 00:10:28.900
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

360
00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:29.680
<v Speaker 5>but never,</v>

361
00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:30.161
<v Speaker 5>never like,</v>

362
00:10:30.161 --> 00:10:30.341
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

363
00:10:30.341 --> 00:10:32.260
<v Speaker 5>it's all going downhill and it's about to come apart.</v>

364
00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:34.360
<v Speaker 1>But have you ever gotten to a point,</v>

365
00:10:34.361 --> 00:10:34.630
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

366
00:10:34.630 --> 00:10:39.630
<v Speaker 1>I assume your process is you first climate with ropes to find out where your</v>

367
00:10:39.901 --> 00:10:40.734
<v Speaker 1>route would be?</v>

368
00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:41.371
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

369
00:10:41.371 --> 00:10:42.270
<v Speaker 5>just generally.</v>

370
00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:43.220
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

371
00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:43.541
<v Speaker 5>I should,</v>

372
00:10:43.541 --> 00:10:43.831
<v Speaker 5>do you know,</v>

373
00:10:43.831 --> 00:10:44.551
<v Speaker 5>anything more climate?</v>

374
00:10:44.551 --> 00:10:45.160
<v Speaker 5>Have you climbed in it?</v>

375
00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:45.430
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

376
00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:45.861
<v Speaker 5>never climbed.</v>

377
00:10:45.861 --> 00:10:46.480
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

378
00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:47.313
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

379
00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:48.780
<v Speaker 5>because like within climbing,</v>

380
00:10:48.781 --> 00:10:48.991
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

381
00:10:48.991 --> 00:10:50.130
<v Speaker 5>there's more of a context for it.</v>

382
00:10:50.131 --> 00:10:50.640
<v Speaker 5>But,</v>

383
00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:51.420
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

384
00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:51.781
<v Speaker 5>the thing is,</v>

385
00:10:51.781 --> 00:10:53.730
<v Speaker 5>I mean generally there's already a root established.</v>

386
00:10:53.731 --> 00:10:54.690
<v Speaker 5>You have like a little Topo,</v>

387
00:10:54.691 --> 00:10:56.070
<v Speaker 5>you have a map that tells you where your spot.</v>

388
00:10:56.071 --> 00:10:57.810
<v Speaker 5>So people have already done before you yeah.</v>

389
00:10:57.811 --> 00:10:57.991
<v Speaker 5>On,</v>

390
00:10:57.991 --> 00:10:58.710
<v Speaker 5>on all the,</v>

391
00:10:58.710 --> 00:11:00.630
<v Speaker 5>on for the most part,</v>

392
00:11:00.631 --> 00:11:03.450
<v Speaker 5>the things that I've sold it or like established routes that people have done</v>

393
00:11:03.451 --> 00:11:03.930
<v Speaker 5>before.</v>

394
00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:05.610
<v Speaker 5>And for the most part I've done them before too.</v>

395
00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.760
<v Speaker 5>So I already kind of know this series of movements that you had to go through</v>

396
00:11:08.761 --> 00:11:09.300
<v Speaker 5>them once.</v>

397
00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:10.560
<v Speaker 5>So the first time you went through it,</v>

398
00:11:10.561 --> 00:11:12.600
<v Speaker 5>you follow a map of people who've already been there.</v>

399
00:11:12.601 --> 00:11:12.780
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

400
00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:13.490
<v Speaker 5>generally.</v>

401
00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:13.981
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

402
00:11:13.981 --> 00:11:14.814
<v Speaker 5>I mean I have,</v>

403
00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:18.390
<v Speaker 5>it's called onsite when you do something without ever having done it before.</v>

404
00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:20.430
<v Speaker 5>So I have like onsite solid,</v>

405
00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:21.900
<v Speaker 5>big new routes before,</v>

406
00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:22.151
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>

407
00:11:22.151 --> 00:11:22.360
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

408
00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:23.480
<v Speaker 5>just get sweaty talking to you.</v>

409
00:11:23.481 --> 00:11:24.870
<v Speaker 5>I just want to tell you right now for real,</v>

410
00:11:24.910 --> 00:11:27.030
<v Speaker 5>my hands getting sweaty when I'm thinking about this.</v>

411
00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:27.690
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

412
00:11:27.690 --> 00:11:28.081
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>

413
00:11:28.081 --> 00:11:32.780
<v Speaker 5>we're watching a video right now if you on 60 minutes and that was a established</v>

414
00:11:32.781 --> 00:11:36.210
<v Speaker 5>route that you were climbing so that that route was put up in the 60s I think.</v>

415
00:11:36.211 --> 00:11:38.550
<v Speaker 5>Or maybe the 70s they start doing this in the 60s.</v>

416
00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:38.910
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

417
00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:40.110
<v Speaker 5>But so when they establish it,</v>

418
00:11:40.111 --> 00:11:42.870
<v Speaker 5>they use p tons and hammers and they're like well their way up the mountain,</v>

419
00:11:43.230 --> 00:11:43.471
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

420
00:11:43.471 --> 00:11:45.000
<v Speaker 5>because that was kind of the style of the day.</v>

421
00:11:45.090 --> 00:11:48.330
<v Speaker 5>I think they did over multiple days and then in the 70s it got done in a day for</v>

422
00:11:48.331 --> 00:11:50.520
<v Speaker 5>the first time and then you know what I mean?</v>

423
00:11:50.521 --> 00:11:52.350
<v Speaker 5>It's just kind of the gradual progression of style.</v>

424
00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:58.200
<v Speaker 5>So climbing as a sport has been around for a long time.</v>

425
00:11:58.330 --> 00:12:00.760
<v Speaker 5>We'll coming as a sport is like rooted back to albinism.</v>

426
00:12:00.761 --> 00:12:03.760
<v Speaker 5>People like climbing in the Alps and the 18 hundreds and all that.</v>

427
00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:05.590
<v Speaker 5>I mean people are boys climbed a mountain.</v>

428
00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:07.660
<v Speaker 5>I mean look at all the monks and stuff in the Himalaya.</v>

429
00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:10.090
<v Speaker 5>What attracted you to this?</v>

430
00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:11.250
<v Speaker 5>I Dunno,</v>

431
00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:12.310
<v Speaker 5>I just like climbing on things.</v>

432
00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:13.443
<v Speaker 5>Why do you think</v>

433
00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:16.030
<v Speaker 5>this has been since you were,</v>

434
00:12:16.031 --> 00:12:16.540
<v Speaker 5>how old?</v>

435
00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:17.373
<v Speaker 5>How old are you now?</v>

436
00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:18.610
<v Speaker 5>I'm 27 now.</v>

437
00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:20.290
<v Speaker 5>I've been climbing all the time,</v>

438
00:12:20.291 --> 00:12:21.790
<v Speaker 5>like in the gym and stuff since I was 10.</v>

439
00:12:21.791 --> 00:12:22.810
<v Speaker 5>I think it just,</v>

440
00:12:22.930 --> 00:12:23.380
<v Speaker 5>it just,</v>

441
00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:24.310
<v Speaker 5>it was attractive to you?</v>

442
00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:24.761
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

443
00:12:24.761 --> 00:12:25.001
<v Speaker 5>just,</v>

444
00:12:25.001 --> 00:12:25.211
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

445
00:12:25.211 --> 00:12:26.360
<v Speaker 5>as a kid I love commentaries.</v>

446
00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:27.430
<v Speaker 5>I love climbing buildings.</v>

447
00:12:27.431 --> 00:12:28.420
<v Speaker 5>I'd like play on stuff,</v>

448
00:12:28.450 --> 00:12:28.631
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

449
00:12:28.631 --> 00:12:29.270
<v Speaker 5>climb the roof,</v>

450
00:12:29.270 --> 00:12:30.103
<v Speaker 5>whatever.</v>

451
00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:30.970
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

452
00:12:30.970 --> 00:12:31.331
<v Speaker 5>and then,</v>

453
00:12:31.331 --> 00:12:31.600
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

454
00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:33.360
<v Speaker 5>my parents read about this gym opening and sack,</v>

455
00:12:33.370 --> 00:12:34.203
<v Speaker 5>like climbing gym.</v>

456
00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:35.680
<v Speaker 5>So I went and started climbing inside.</v>

457
00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:37.690
<v Speaker 5>What do your parents think about this?</v>

458
00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:40.030
<v Speaker 5>While I was like surprisingly supportive,</v>

459
00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:41.053
<v Speaker 5>you know what I mean?</v>

460
00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:41.261
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

461
00:12:41.261 --> 00:12:41.441
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

462
00:12:41.441 --> 00:12:44.740
<v Speaker 5>well I mean she just kind of trusts me to do what I like to do and do it well</v>

463
00:12:44.741 --> 00:12:45.370
<v Speaker 5>and you know,</v>

464
00:12:45.370 --> 00:12:46.480
<v Speaker 5>make good decisions or whatever.</v>

465
00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:47.350
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

466
00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:48.420
<v Speaker 5>making good decisions.</v>

467
00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:50.170
<v Speaker 5>That's a huge understatement.</v>

468
00:12:50.410 --> 00:12:50.990
<v Speaker 5>It's one thing,</v>

469
00:12:50.990 --> 00:12:51.400
<v Speaker 5>say,</v>

470
00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:52.040
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

471
00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:52.370
<v Speaker 5>sign.</v>

472
00:12:52.370 --> 00:12:53.860
<v Speaker 5>If you want to get into the insurance business,</v>

473
00:12:53.861 --> 00:12:55.120
<v Speaker 5>you've got to make good decisions.</v>

474
00:12:55.460 --> 00:12:57.610
<v Speaker 5>That's one thing.</v>

475
00:12:57.870 --> 00:13:01.510
<v Speaker 5>Is anybody like in any course in life has to like make good decisions?</v>

476
00:13:01.590 --> 00:13:01.980
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

477
00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:02.621
<v Speaker 5>You are correct.</v>

478
00:13:02.621 --> 00:13:02.831
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

479
00:13:02.831 --> 00:13:04.660
<v Speaker 5>cause if I was going out partying every,</v>

480
00:13:04.661 --> 00:13:05.494
<v Speaker 5>every weekend,</v>

481
00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:05.951
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

482
00:13:05.951 --> 00:13:08.320
<v Speaker 5>I'd probably have almost as high of a risk of death,</v>

483
00:13:08.410 --> 00:13:08.711
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

484
00:13:08.711 --> 00:13:11.230
<v Speaker 5>like driving drunk and all that kind of stuff is what I'm doing.</v>

485
00:13:11.290 --> 00:13:12.150
<v Speaker 5>You'll probably right.</v>

486
00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:12.371
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

487
00:13:12.371 --> 00:13:12.761
<v Speaker 5>so it's like,</v>

488
00:13:12.761 --> 00:13:15.450
<v Speaker 5>it's all just how you view risk and reward rewarding.</v>

489
00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:16.541
<v Speaker 5>It certainly is,</v>

490
00:13:16.541 --> 00:13:16.931
<v Speaker 5>but that,</v>

491
00:13:16.931 --> 00:13:17.201
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

492
00:13:17.201 --> 00:13:19.690
<v Speaker 5>that really is an understatement when you're saying make them good decisions.</v>

493
00:13:19.691 --> 00:13:21.490
<v Speaker 5>You climbing up these things,</v>

494
00:13:21.491 --> 00:13:22.360
<v Speaker 5>like what is the tallest thing?</v>

495
00:13:22.361 --> 00:13:24.580
<v Speaker 5>You've climbed a like 3000 feet minutes.</v>

496
00:13:29.410 --> 00:13:29.591
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

497
00:13:29.591 --> 00:13:29.831
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

498
00:13:29.831 --> 00:13:33.430
<v Speaker 5>but the difference between 3075 it doesn't make that big difference as far as</v>

499
00:13:33.431 --> 00:13:33.940
<v Speaker 5>death.</v>

500
00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:34.773
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

501
00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:36.490
<v Speaker 5>60 you're pretty much hosed.</v>

502
00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:39.600
<v Speaker 5>But doesn't it feel like a freak out when you're up?</v>

503
00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:40.541
<v Speaker 5>To me,</v>

504
00:13:40.541 --> 00:13:41.410
<v Speaker 5>the appeal is the,</v>

505
00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:42.610
<v Speaker 5>is the bigness.</v>

506
00:13:42.611 --> 00:13:42.881
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

507
00:13:42.881 --> 00:13:44.290
<v Speaker 5>like I look at a huge face and I'm like,</v>

508
00:13:44.291 --> 00:13:45.250
<v Speaker 5>that looks Rad.</v>

509
00:13:45.490 --> 00:13:45.731
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

510
00:13:45.731 --> 00:13:46.930
<v Speaker 5>if I look at it 60 foot face,</v>

511
00:13:46.931 --> 00:13:47.381
<v Speaker 5>I'm kind of like,</v>

512
00:13:47.381 --> 00:13:47.651
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

513
00:13:47.651 --> 00:13:47.921
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

514
00:13:47.921 --> 00:13:48.754
<v Speaker 5>that looks okay.</v>

515
00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:51.310
<v Speaker 5>But when you see a really huge,</v>

516
00:13:51.311 --> 00:13:52.270
<v Speaker 5>impressive while you're like,</v>

517
00:13:52.271 --> 00:13:53.200
<v Speaker 5>that's inspiring.</v>

518
00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:53.441
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>

519
00:13:53.441 --> 00:13:54.300
<v Speaker 5>That's what I get psyched about.</v>

520
00:13:54.370 --> 00:13:54.820
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

521
00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:56.680
<v Speaker 5>do you like people watching you do this?</v>

522
00:13:57.090 --> 00:13:57.310
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

523
00:13:57.310 --> 00:13:58.143
<v Speaker 5>not particularly.</v>

524
00:13:58.180 --> 00:14:02.770
<v Speaker 5>And I've done very little soling that's actually like live and watched,</v>

525
00:14:03.190 --> 00:14:03.431
<v Speaker 5>you know.</v>

526
00:14:03.431 --> 00:14:05.620
<v Speaker 5>So most of the videos that you've seen and stuff for um,</v>

527
00:14:05.980 --> 00:14:06.400
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

528
00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:07.150
<v Speaker 5>repeated afterwards.</v>

529
00:14:07.150 --> 00:14:10.270
<v Speaker 5>Well actually it's funny cause the one that you're queuing right now is well so</v>

530
00:14:10.290 --> 00:14:11.123
<v Speaker 5>semi live.</v>

531
00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:12.393
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

532
00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:13.460
<v Speaker 5>and the 60 minutes thing,</v>

533
00:14:13.461 --> 00:14:15.880
<v Speaker 5>it was live cause they're like a legitimate news organization.</v>

534
00:14:15.881 --> 00:14:16.960
<v Speaker 5>They had to shoot the real thing.</v>

535
00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:17.320
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

536
00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:20.650
<v Speaker 5>Did it weird for you to have people filming you?</v>

537
00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:24.370
<v Speaker 5>That's the thing is that generally when I film on projects like that,</v>

538
00:14:24.371 --> 00:14:25.204
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

539
00:14:25.270 --> 00:14:26.170
<v Speaker 5>I do things that are like,</v>

540
00:14:26.171 --> 00:14:28.780
<v Speaker 5>well within my abilities kind of comfortable and easy and whatever.</v>

541
00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:29.800
<v Speaker 5>So the 60 minutes thing,</v>

542
00:14:29.801 --> 00:14:31.270
<v Speaker 5>even though it looks awesome and it's really cool,</v>

543
00:14:31.271 --> 00:14:33.520
<v Speaker 5>that's actually kind of like a moderate route and it's not like,</v>

544
00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:33.970
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

545
00:14:33.970 --> 00:14:35.740
<v Speaker 5>it's not breaking new ground for rock climbing.</v>

546
00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:37.480
<v Speaker 5>I mean it never been sold before and it's,</v>

547
00:14:37.481 --> 00:14:38.410
<v Speaker 5>and it's pretty hard,</v>

548
00:14:39.010 --> 00:14:42.160
<v Speaker 5>but mostly I just chose something that was aesthetic and like cool.</v>

549
00:14:42.190 --> 00:14:42.431
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

550
00:14:42.431 --> 00:14:46.210
<v Speaker 5>it was like good enough but it's never been sold before.</v>

551
00:14:46.510 --> 00:14:46.721
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

552
00:14:46.721 --> 00:14:47.240
<v Speaker 5>that's the,</v>

553
00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:48.600
<v Speaker 5>that's quite as well,</v>

554
00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:49.990
<v Speaker 5>there aren't that many people have that solar,</v>

555
00:14:49.991 --> 00:14:50.290
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

556
00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:51.590
<v Speaker 5>you're like not that many folks are into it.</v>

557
00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:52.790
<v Speaker 5>So you kind of have your pick of the,</v>

558
00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:53.661
<v Speaker 5>pick the letter,</v>

559
00:14:53.661 --> 00:14:53.930
<v Speaker 5>you know.</v>

560
00:14:53.930 --> 00:14:55.580
<v Speaker 5>Well if there are that many folks into it,</v>

561
00:14:55.790 --> 00:14:57.500
<v Speaker 5>how many of them aren't around anymore?</v>

562
00:14:58.550 --> 00:14:59.030
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

563
00:14:59.030 --> 00:14:59.241
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

564
00:14:59.241 --> 00:15:00.140
<v Speaker 5>it depends how you count.</v>

565
00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:02.703
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

566
00:15:03.190 --> 00:15:04.370
<v Speaker 5>what does this mean?</v>

567
00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:08.570
<v Speaker 5>I can only think of one really high end Solos to actually died.</v>

568
00:15:08.571 --> 00:15:09.620
<v Speaker 5>So line really?</v>

569
00:15:09.621 --> 00:15:09.991
<v Speaker 5>I think.</v>

570
00:15:09.991 --> 00:15:10.310
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

571
00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:11.143

572
00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:12.193
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

573
00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:13.160
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

574
00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:14.840
<v Speaker 5>who was he a John Packer?</v>

575
00:15:15.050 --> 00:15:16.010
<v Speaker 5>He was actually kind of like a,</v>

576
00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:16.730
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

577
00:15:16.730 --> 00:15:17.670
<v Speaker 5>childhood inspiration.</v>

578
00:15:17.671 --> 00:15:18.830
<v Speaker 5>Like you spell his last name a,</v>

579
00:15:19.010 --> 00:15:20.060
<v Speaker 5>B.</v>

00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:20.060
<v Speaker 5>A.</v>

581
00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:20.060
<v Speaker 5>C.</v>

582
00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:20.060
<v Speaker 5>H.</v>

583
00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:20.060
<v Speaker 5>A.</v>

584
00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:20.750
<v Speaker 5>R.</v>

585
00:15:20.750 --> 00:15:21.583
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

586
00:15:22.210 --> 00:15:22.481
<v Speaker 5>He,</v>

587
00:15:22.481 --> 00:15:22.670
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

588
00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:24.140
<v Speaker 5>he fell solely on things.</v>

589
00:15:24.141 --> 00:15:24.921
<v Speaker 5>He was kind of older.</v>

590
00:15:24.921 --> 00:15:25.101
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

591
00:15:25.101 --> 00:15:26.870
<v Speaker 5>he was maybe 50 or something and,</v>

592
00:15:26.871 --> 00:15:27.080
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

593
00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:29.440
<v Speaker 5>he'd had a car accident and had some like nerve damage and like,</v>

594
00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:29.751
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

595
00:15:29.751 --> 00:15:30.950
<v Speaker 5>who knows what actually happened?</v>

596
00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:31.101
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

597
00:15:31.101 --> 00:15:31.570
<v Speaker 5>Jesus.</v>

598
00:15:31.570 --> 00:15:32.210
<v Speaker 5>He,</v>

599
00:15:32.210 --> 00:15:33.080
<v Speaker 5>maybe he broke a hole.</v>

600
00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:33.860
<v Speaker 5>Maybe he just,</v>

601
00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:34.670
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

602
00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:35.001
<v Speaker 5>But like,</v>

603
00:15:35.001 --> 00:15:35.391
<v Speaker 5>he'd had,</v>

604
00:15:35.391 --> 00:15:35.631
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

605
00:15:35.631 --> 00:15:38.300
<v Speaker 5>like back issues and things going on because you'd had this like,</v>

606
00:15:38.301 --> 00:15:39.170
<v Speaker 5>horrible car accident.</v>

607
00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:39.820
<v Speaker 5>Oh Wow.</v>

608
00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:40.240
<v Speaker 5>So on,</v>

609
00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:42.200
<v Speaker 5>it's one of those things where it's not like a clear cut,</v>

610
00:15:42.201 --> 00:15:43.034
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

611
00:15:43.070 --> 00:15:43.521
<v Speaker 5>well I mean,</v>

612
00:15:43.521 --> 00:15:43.701
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

613
00:15:43.701 --> 00:15:44.511
<v Speaker 5>I mean it is clear cut.</v>

614
00:15:44.511 --> 00:15:45.680
<v Speaker 5>He fell off the mountain and he died.</v>

615
00:15:45.681 --> 00:15:46.550
<v Speaker 5>But um,</v>

616
00:15:46.910 --> 00:15:47.450
<v Speaker 5>so,</v>

617
00:15:47.450 --> 00:15:48.290
<v Speaker 5>but you know,</v>

618
00:15:48.291 --> 00:15:49.280
<v Speaker 5>you look at it cause he was,</v>

619
00:15:49.281 --> 00:15:53.000
<v Speaker 5>he was by far the best of his generation for like the eighties and early</v>

620
00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.710
<v Speaker 5>nineties and actually the 70s until the 90s,</v>

621
00:15:54.711 --> 00:15:55.544
<v Speaker 5>basically.</v>

622
00:15:55.940 --> 00:16:00.200
<v Speaker 5>Now when you see a guy and that's how it ends for him and he's a free solo</v>

623
00:16:00.201 --> 00:16:00.561
<v Speaker 5>climber,</v>

624
00:16:00.561 --> 00:16:01.700
<v Speaker 5>do you look at that and say,</v>

625
00:16:01.701 --> 00:16:02.061
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

626
00:16:02.061 --> 00:16:03.350
<v Speaker 5>we know what everybody goes.</v>

627
00:16:03.351 --> 00:16:03.531
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

628
00:16:03.531 --> 00:16:04.850
<v Speaker 5>that's kind of a cool way to do it.</v>

629
00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:07.490
<v Speaker 5>Definitely not like that's a cool way to do that.</v>

630
00:16:07.491 --> 00:16:08.121
<v Speaker 5>That's horrible.</v>

631
00:16:08.121 --> 00:16:08.710
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

632
00:16:08.710 --> 00:16:09.021
<v Speaker 5>I know,</v>

633
00:16:09.021 --> 00:16:09.651
<v Speaker 5>I mean honestly,</v>

634
00:16:09.651 --> 00:16:12.830
<v Speaker 5>he basically broke everything in his body and he lay there for hours and died.</v>

635
00:16:12.831 --> 00:16:13.251
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>

636
00:16:13.251 --> 00:16:14.150
<v Speaker 5>That's like a horrible,</v>

637
00:16:14.151 --> 00:16:14.481
<v Speaker 5>horrible,</v>

638
00:16:14.481 --> 00:16:15.530
<v Speaker 5>he didn't die instantly.</v>

639
00:16:15.650 --> 00:16:15.981
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

640
00:16:15.981 --> 00:16:16.291
<v Speaker 5>he,</v>

641
00:16:16.291 --> 00:16:16.701
<v Speaker 5>he was,</v>

642
00:16:16.701 --> 00:16:17.240
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

643
00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:19.550
<v Speaker 5>he was out at like a 60 foot cliff by his house or whatever.</v>

644
00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:21.410
<v Speaker 5>So he probably felt like 50 feet.</v>

645
00:16:21.411 --> 00:16:24.410
<v Speaker 5>He broke everything in his body and he bled out or I don't know what happened.</v>

646
00:16:24.411 --> 00:16:24.780
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

647
00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:25.940
<v Speaker 5>it's like a horrible,</v>

648
00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:26.211
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

649
00:16:26.211 --> 00:16:27.260
<v Speaker 5>it's a horrible thing to happen,</v>

650
00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:29.050
<v Speaker 5>but yeah,</v>

651
00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:30.770
<v Speaker 5>I mean if you felt like 2000 feet,</v>

652
00:16:30.771 --> 00:16:30.981
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

653
00:16:30.981 --> 00:16:31.970
<v Speaker 5>you would splat like,</v>

654
00:16:32.330 --> 00:16:33.890
<v Speaker 5>you would just explode like a bag of water.</v>

655
00:16:33.891 --> 00:16:34.370
<v Speaker 5>But like,</v>

656
00:16:34.370 --> 00:16:35.091
<v Speaker 5>but from 50,</v>

657
00:16:35.091 --> 00:16:36.320
<v Speaker 5>it's like that's a pretty horrible,</v>

658
00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:36.891
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

659
00:16:36.891 --> 00:16:38.630
<v Speaker 5>that sounds like a terrible way to go.</v>

660
00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:38.931
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

661
00:16:38.931 --> 00:16:40.580
<v Speaker 5>I mean it totally sucks,</v>

662
00:16:40.610 --> 00:16:41.121
<v Speaker 5>but I mean,</v>

663
00:16:41.121 --> 00:16:41.954
<v Speaker 5>the thing is,</v>

664
00:16:42.410 --> 00:16:42.771
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

665
00:16:42.771 --> 00:16:43.110
<v Speaker 5>he,</v>

666
00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:45.640
<v Speaker 5>he lived his whole life doing that kind of thing and you know,</v>

667
00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:49.160
<v Speaker 5>he'd obviously confronted those kinds of issues in his life and you know,</v>

668
00:16:49.161 --> 00:16:49.301
<v Speaker 5>he,</v>

669
00:16:49.301 --> 00:16:50.550
<v Speaker 5>he made his choice and that's,</v>

670
00:16:50.970 --> 00:16:51.803
<v Speaker 5>that's how it worked out,</v>

671
00:16:52.530 --> 00:16:53.363
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

672
00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:54.980
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

673
00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:56.120
<v Speaker 5>How many people are doing it,</v>

674
00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:56.630
<v Speaker 5>if you,</v>

675
00:16:56.630 --> 00:16:57.470
<v Speaker 5>if you had to guess,</v>

676
00:16:57.830 --> 00:16:58.400
<v Speaker 5>is it a,</v>

677
00:16:58.400 --> 00:16:58.641
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

678
00:16:58.641 --> 00:16:59.150
<v Speaker 5>so that's,</v>

679
00:16:59.150 --> 00:17:02.000
<v Speaker 5>earlier I said the difference between high and so long and like recreational</v>

680
00:17:02.001 --> 00:17:02.271
<v Speaker 5>stuff.</v>

681
00:17:02.271 --> 00:17:03.760
<v Speaker 5>So if you're counting recreational,</v>

682
00:17:03.770 --> 00:17:06.020
<v Speaker 5>just going out and climbing fun routes after work or whatever,</v>

683
00:17:06.021 --> 00:17:07.610
<v Speaker 5>they're tons of climbers that go Solon,</v>

684
00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:08.391
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>

685
00:17:08.391 --> 00:17:09.224
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

686
00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:10.071
<v Speaker 5>high end style,</v>

687
00:17:10.071 --> 00:17:11.330
<v Speaker 5>like pushing it on hard,</v>

688
00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:11.990
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

689
00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:12.321
<v Speaker 5>hard,</v>

690
00:17:12.321 --> 00:17:14.510
<v Speaker 5>hard routes like the kind of videos that you're watching where you're like,</v>

691
00:17:14.511 --> 00:17:15.350
<v Speaker 5>that looks insane.</v>

692
00:17:15.650 --> 00:17:16.483
<v Speaker 5>Then there,</v>

693
00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:20.490
<v Speaker 5>right now there's maybe a half dozen dudes in the world that I think things</v>

694
00:17:20.510 --> 00:17:21.500
<v Speaker 5>similar like that,</v>

695
00:17:21.501 --> 00:17:21.950
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

696
00:17:21.950 --> 00:17:26.950
<v Speaker 5>but you are known as the one who does the most ridiculous routes.</v>

697
00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:30.640
<v Speaker 5>Even the one who's known as the guy well in,</v>

698
00:17:30.641 --> 00:17:32.300
<v Speaker 5>in the u s right now anyway,</v>

699
00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:33.410
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

700
00:17:33.410 --> 00:17:34.730
<v Speaker 5>who else is doing this?</v>

701
00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:36.320
<v Speaker 5>Where's this like popular?</v>

702
00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:40.040
<v Speaker 5>There are a couple of dudes in Europe who've done maybe not like at this moment</v>

703
00:17:40.041 --> 00:17:41.330
<v Speaker 5>there and doing anything crazy,</v>

704
00:17:41.331 --> 00:17:42.020
<v Speaker 5>but um,</v>

705
00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:44.120
<v Speaker 5>that's certainly like recently I've done really hard things.</v>

706
00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:45.520
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

707
00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:46.353
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

708
00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:46.941
<v Speaker 5>I mean there's a,</v>

709
00:17:46.941 --> 00:17:48.560
<v Speaker 5>there's a history of soloing all around the world.</v>

710
00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:49.740
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

711
00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:49.981
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

712
00:17:49.981 --> 00:17:51.540
<v Speaker 5>this is completely new to me.</v>

713
00:17:51.541 --> 00:17:52.170
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

714
00:17:52.170 --> 00:17:53.610
<v Speaker 5>I had seen like maybe,</v>

715
00:17:53.611 --> 00:17:54.444
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

716
00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:57.660
<v Speaker 5>randomly gone across videos on the Internet of Peter Climbing things,</v>

717
00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:01.830
<v Speaker 5>but I really never seen anything where people would put climbing without ropes.</v>

718
00:18:02.250 --> 00:18:03.780
<v Speaker 5>So when I first saw you doing it,</v>

719
00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:06.510
<v Speaker 5>there's a rich tradition of it,</v>

720
00:18:06.511 --> 00:18:07.380
<v Speaker 5>especially in California,</v>

721
00:18:07.381 --> 00:18:08.460
<v Speaker 5>actually in southern California.</v>

722
00:18:08.850 --> 00:18:09.360
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

723
00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:12.420
<v Speaker 5>all the best climbers in the country in the 70s came from Soco and they were</v>

724
00:18:12.421 --> 00:18:12.900
<v Speaker 5>all,</v>

725
00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:14.040
<v Speaker 5>they were called the stone masters.</v>

726
00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:14.640
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

727
00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:14.790
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

728
00:18:14.790 --> 00:18:15.571
<v Speaker 5>like Joshua tree,</v>

729
00:18:15.571 --> 00:18:15.780
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

730
00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:17.640
<v Speaker 5>which is just local has a,</v>

731
00:18:17.670 --> 00:18:19.370
<v Speaker 5>like a huge history of Solon.</v>

732
00:18:19.750 --> 00:18:20.191
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>

733
00:18:20.191 --> 00:18:23.280
<v Speaker 5>I grew up like hearing soling stories and thinking it was cool and you know,</v>

734
00:18:23.281 --> 00:18:23.850
<v Speaker 5>whatever.</v>

735
00:18:23.850 --> 00:18:24.683
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

736
00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:24.901
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

737
00:18:24.901 --> 00:18:25.051
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

738
00:18:25.051 --> 00:18:26.430
<v Speaker 5>there's a total of like tradition of it,</v>

739
00:18:27.010 --> 00:18:29.100
<v Speaker 5>but so do you make a living doing this?</v>

740
00:18:29.370 --> 00:18:30.210
<v Speaker 5>I do now.</v>

741
00:18:30.211 --> 00:18:30.391
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

742
00:18:30.391 --> 00:18:31.110
<v Speaker 5>That's pretty,</v>

743
00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:31.590
<v Speaker 5>pretty cool.</v>

744
00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:32.250
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

745
00:18:32.250 --> 00:18:33.240
<v Speaker 5>And how did that happen?</v>

746
00:18:33.241 --> 00:18:34.140
<v Speaker 5>Do you have sponsors?</v>

747
00:18:34.141 --> 00:18:34.281
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

748
00:18:34.281 --> 00:18:35.114
<v Speaker 5>that's how sponsors,</v>

749
00:18:35.330 --> 00:18:35.960
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

750
00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:36.793
<v Speaker 5>sorta picked him up,</v>

751
00:18:36.810 --> 00:18:37.021
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

752
00:18:37.021 --> 00:18:41.460
<v Speaker 5>through the climbing community is I went and the sponsors just give you money</v>

753
00:18:41.461 --> 00:18:42.790
<v Speaker 5>and they pay you every month and just,</v>

754
00:18:42.810 --> 00:18:43.800
<v Speaker 5>you just go climbing.</v>

755
00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:44.320
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

756
00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:44.850
<v Speaker 5>Yup.</v>

757
00:18:44.850 --> 00:18:45.120
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

758
00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:45.930
<v Speaker 5>they're really awesome.</v>

759
00:18:45.930 --> 00:18:49.830
<v Speaker 5>Are there competitions or do you just go wherever you want to go and people</v>

760
00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:52.470
<v Speaker 5>follow you and the publicity helps them?</v>

761
00:18:52.471 --> 00:18:53.304
<v Speaker 5>Is that how it works?</v>

762
00:18:54.030 --> 00:18:55.710
<v Speaker 5>So there are competitions in climbing,</v>

763
00:18:55.740 --> 00:18:56.220
<v Speaker 5>but um,</v>

764
00:18:56.220 --> 00:18:59.220
<v Speaker 5>it's kind of like skiing or something where it kind of subdivides into like</v>

765
00:18:59.221 --> 00:19:00.930
<v Speaker 5>Olympic style competition scheme.</v>

766
00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:04.410
<v Speaker 5>And then there's like big mountain type dudes who make videos and just like go</v>

767
00:19:04.411 --> 00:19:05.310
<v Speaker 5>rage in Alaska.</v>

768
00:19:05.670 --> 00:19:08.190
<v Speaker 5>So I'm kind of one of those like big mountain type dudes that just goes and</v>

769
00:19:08.191 --> 00:19:10.020
<v Speaker 5>rages and makes videos and does whatever.</v>

770
00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:11.370
<v Speaker 5>Like I don't do competitions.</v>

771
00:19:11.371 --> 00:19:12.570
<v Speaker 5>It's kind of like two different supports.</v>

772
00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:13.411
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

773
00:19:13.411 --> 00:19:14.880
<v Speaker 5>you don't want to be rushed.</v>

774
00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:17.030
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't seem like something you would want to win.</v>

775
00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:17.541
<v Speaker 5>How would you,</v>

776
00:19:17.541 --> 00:19:17.761
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

777
00:19:17.761 --> 00:19:18.720
<v Speaker 5>who would I compete with?</v>

778
00:19:18.721 --> 00:19:18.931
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

779
00:19:18.931 --> 00:19:20.790
<v Speaker 5>like nobody else even likes to do this kind of stuff,</v>

780
00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:21.270
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

781
00:19:21.270 --> 00:19:22.260
<v Speaker 5>Like that.</v>

782
00:19:22.261 --> 00:19:23.520
<v Speaker 5>Doesn't that sound crazy though?</v>

783
00:19:23.521 --> 00:19:26.520
<v Speaker 5>You're still talking about 300 million people in this country and this may be</v>

784
00:19:26.521 --> 00:19:28.650
<v Speaker 5>like five other dudes that are doing what you're doing.</v>

785
00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:29.120
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

786
00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:31.290
<v Speaker 5>maybe five other than the world and the world.</v>

787
00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:31.711
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

788
00:19:31.711 --> 00:19:32.251
<v Speaker 5>And this country.</v>

789
00:19:32.251 --> 00:19:33.084
<v Speaker 5>You're the only guy?</v>

790
00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:33.450
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

791
00:19:33.450 --> 00:19:34.350
<v Speaker 5>there's like another dude,</v>

792
00:19:34.351 --> 00:19:35.161
<v Speaker 5>he's a little older than me.</v>

793
00:19:35.161 --> 00:19:35.311
<v Speaker 5>Who,</v>

794
00:19:35.311 --> 00:19:35.640
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

795
00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:36.870
<v Speaker 5>do you guys look at each other weird like,</v>

796
00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:37.141
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

797
00:19:37.141 --> 00:19:37.974
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

798
00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:41.270
<v Speaker 5>Definitely not facing.</v>

799
00:19:41.590 --> 00:19:42.320
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

800
00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:44.070
<v Speaker 5>now there are a handful of dudes in the states and I mean,</v>

801
00:19:44.071 --> 00:19:45.960
<v Speaker 5>and things you never know because so much is so long.</v>

802
00:19:45.961 --> 00:19:50.961
<v Speaker 5>It just has to do with like motivation because the actual technical difficulty</v>

803
00:19:51.871 --> 00:19:52.980
<v Speaker 5>of the climbing isn't very high.</v>

804
00:19:53.010 --> 00:19:53.940
<v Speaker 5>Like the thing that I did,</v>

805
00:19:53.941 --> 00:19:56.720
<v Speaker 5>I'm on 60 minutes is actually like a pretty easy route.</v>

806
00:19:56.721 --> 00:19:57.554
<v Speaker 5>It's very moderate.</v>

807
00:19:58.050 --> 00:19:58.560
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

808
00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:01.350
<v Speaker 5>I mean like a lot of climbers who have only been climbing a few years could</v>

809
00:20:01.351 --> 00:20:02.700
<v Speaker 5>climb that difficulty level,</v>

810
00:20:03.030 --> 00:20:05.220
<v Speaker 5>but they just would never want to do it without a rope.</v>

811
00:20:05.250 --> 00:20:05.521
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

812
00:20:05.521 --> 00:20:06.600
<v Speaker 5>they don't have that motivation.</v>

813
00:20:06.601 --> 00:20:06.931
<v Speaker 5>It'd be like,</v>

814
00:20:06.931 --> 00:20:08.550
<v Speaker 5>I want to climb it huge face with no,</v>

815
00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:09.330
<v Speaker 5>no protection.</v>

816
00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:10.011
<v Speaker 5>Now when you,</v>

817
00:20:10.011 --> 00:20:10.350
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

818
00:20:10.350 --> 00:20:12.250
<v Speaker 5>you say that it's no big deal that you're,</v>

819
00:20:12.410 --> 00:20:16.380
<v Speaker 5>you were the first person of free solo something that is a big deal.</v>

820
00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:16.741
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

821
00:20:16.741 --> 00:20:17.850
<v Speaker 5>you're just being humble.</v>

822
00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:18.780
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

823
00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:19.200
<v Speaker 5>You are,</v>

824
00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:19.921
<v Speaker 5>you're being humble.</v>

825
00:20:19.921 --> 00:20:20.754
<v Speaker 5>You're crazy.</v>

826
00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:21.460
<v Speaker 5>Listen to me.</v>

827
00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:21.940
<v Speaker 5>Come on.</v>

828
00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:23.420
<v Speaker 5>I'm older now.</v>

829
00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:25.710
<v Speaker 5>I'm not saying you didn't see him for doing that.</v>

830
00:20:25.711 --> 00:20:26.370
<v Speaker 5>I'm saying,</v>

831
00:20:26.370 --> 00:20:26.761
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

832
00:20:26.761 --> 00:20:27.031
<v Speaker 5>your,</v>

833
00:20:27.031 --> 00:20:27.600
<v Speaker 5>your,</v>

834
00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:30.240
<v Speaker 5>your point of view is very self deprecating,</v>

835
00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:30.871
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

836
00:20:30.871 --> 00:20:35.520
<v Speaker 5>so you're your idea that that's not crazy to be the first person to climb up it</v>

837
00:20:35.910 --> 00:20:38.600
<v Speaker 5>in the known human race ropes.</v>

838
00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:38.871
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

839
00:20:38.871 --> 00:20:39.360
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

840
00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:40.800
<v Speaker 5>It's kind of fucking crazy kid,</v>

841
00:20:41.490 --> 00:20:43.620
<v Speaker 5>but it seems more normal when you do it all the time,</v>

842
00:20:43.621 --> 00:20:43.950
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

843
00:20:43.950 --> 00:20:44.730
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure.</v>

844
00:20:44.730 --> 00:20:46.650
<v Speaker 5>But I'm just saying to a person like,</v>

845
00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:47.610
<v Speaker 5>like me.</v>

846
00:20:47.610 --> 00:20:47.890
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

847
00:20:47.890 --> 00:20:48.410
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

848
00:20:48.410 --> 00:20:48.620
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

849
00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:49.630
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty impressive.</v>

850
00:20:50.290 --> 00:20:54.460
<v Speaker 1>When you do you go up something with ropes and say,</v>

851
00:20:54.461 --> 00:20:55.090
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

852
00:20:55.090 --> 00:20:56.380
<v Speaker 1>I see enough spots.</v>

853
00:20:56.530 --> 00:20:57.970
<v Speaker 1>Do you map it out in your head?</v>

854
00:20:58.580 --> 00:20:59.170
<v Speaker 5>For sure.</v>

855
00:20:59.170 --> 00:21:00.700
<v Speaker 5>So like for the 60 minutes when,</v>

856
00:21:00.701 --> 00:21:01.271
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>

857
00:21:01.271 --> 00:21:04.930
<v Speaker 5>I'd climbed it a month before just to like see if it was reasonable and I was</v>

858
00:21:04.931 --> 00:21:05.051
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

859
00:21:05.051 --> 00:21:05.291
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

860
00:21:05.291 --> 00:21:06.310
<v Speaker 5>I could definitely do this.</v>

861
00:21:06.580 --> 00:21:10.600
<v Speaker 5>And then maybe 10 days before I climbed it again with more like intention and</v>

862
00:21:10.601 --> 00:21:11.170
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

863
00:21:11.170 --> 00:21:14.530
<v Speaker 5>there are basically two hard parts on it and the rest is sort of like filler,</v>

864
00:21:14.710 --> 00:21:15.011
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

865
00:21:15.011 --> 00:21:15.880
<v Speaker 5>like moderate climate,</v>

866
00:21:16.210 --> 00:21:19.010
<v Speaker 5>like the type that I could easily do first try whatever without no,</v>

867
00:21:19.030 --> 00:21:21.850
<v Speaker 5>when you say hard parts and you get to a place,</v>

868
00:21:21.851 --> 00:21:23.080
<v Speaker 5>what makes it a hard part?</v>

869
00:21:23.230 --> 00:21:24.520
<v Speaker 5>So the crack is like thinner,</v>

870
00:21:24.521 --> 00:21:27.310
<v Speaker 5>so you have less of your finger inside so you have to like pull harder and the</v>

871
00:21:27.311 --> 00:21:28.750
<v Speaker 5>fee get bad and it gets steeper.</v>

872
00:21:28.780 --> 00:21:31.030
<v Speaker 5>So the angle of the walls is steeper.</v>

873
00:21:31.370 --> 00:21:31.840
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

874
00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:33.310
<v Speaker 5>basically it just becomes more strenuous.</v>

875
00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:35.500
<v Speaker 5>But so both of those two sections where maybe,</v>

876
00:21:35.810 --> 00:21:36.170
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

877
00:21:36.170 --> 00:21:37.210
<v Speaker 5>10 movements long,</v>

878
00:21:37.350 --> 00:21:38.500
<v Speaker 5>he said there may be like 15,</v>

879
00:21:38.501 --> 00:21:42.030
<v Speaker 5>20 foot sections and I just have to memorize like 10 or 15 moves.</v>

880
00:21:42.031 --> 00:21:42.431
<v Speaker 5>So where I'm like,</v>

881
00:21:42.431 --> 00:21:42.641
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>

882
00:21:42.641 --> 00:21:45.430
<v Speaker 5>And then I do my left hand to that little thing and then I pull really hard and</v>

883
00:21:45.431 --> 00:21:46.241
<v Speaker 5>then I raised my foot.</v>

884
00:21:46.241 --> 00:21:46.820
<v Speaker 5>You know that.</v>

885
00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:48.920
<v Speaker 1>So as you're going up this in a rope,</v>

886
00:21:48.990 --> 00:21:53.870
<v Speaker 1>are you just visualizing going along it or you actually fitting it with your</v>

887
00:21:53.871 --> 00:21:54.440
<v Speaker 1>hands?</v>

888
00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:54.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

889
00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:55.280
<v Speaker 5>both.</v>

890
00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:55.580
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>

891
00:21:55.580 --> 00:21:55.770
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

892
00:21:55.770 --> 00:21:56.850
<v Speaker 5>I'm climbing it and then,</v>

893
00:21:56.851 --> 00:21:57.180
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

894
00:21:57.180 --> 00:21:58.440
<v Speaker 5>some of it I marched with chalk,</v>

895
00:21:58.470 --> 00:22:00.090
<v Speaker 5>which is totally normal for comments too.</v>

896
00:22:00.091 --> 00:22:01.440
<v Speaker 5>I put a little tick next to things.</v>

897
00:22:01.530 --> 00:22:03.720
<v Speaker 5>So you remember like which part of the crack is good.</v>

898
00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:05.280
<v Speaker 5>And then I would memorize like,</v>

899
00:22:05.281 --> 00:22:05.521
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

900
00:22:05.521 --> 00:22:06.780
<v Speaker 5>this is the way to do it.</v>

901
00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:08.160
<v Speaker 5>And then while I had the rope on,</v>

902
00:22:08.170 --> 00:22:11.220
<v Speaker 5>I tried to a couple of different ways on one part to see which felt more secure,</v>

903
00:22:11.370 --> 00:22:12.203
<v Speaker 5>things like that.</v>

904
00:22:12.450 --> 00:22:14.340
<v Speaker 5>And so do you take notes or do yes.</v>

905
00:22:14.341 --> 00:22:16.470
<v Speaker 5>And then afterwards when I was all done and uh,</v>

906
00:22:16.471 --> 00:22:16.711
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

907
00:22:16.711 --> 00:22:17.550
<v Speaker 5>that evening I like,</v>

908
00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:20.460
<v Speaker 5>I drew out the sequences and I have like a climate journal.</v>

909
00:22:20.461 --> 00:22:22.830
<v Speaker 5>I keep track of things like that and just make notes about life,</v>

910
00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:23.430
<v Speaker 5>whatever.</v>

911
00:22:23.430 --> 00:22:25.560
<v Speaker 5>And so I just mapped out the sequences so I could remember it.</v>

912
00:22:25.561 --> 00:22:26.010
<v Speaker 5>Well.</v>

913
00:22:26.010 --> 00:22:27.240
<v Speaker 5>And would you ever publish that?</v>

914
00:22:27.870 --> 00:22:28.380
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

915
00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:28.631
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

916
00:22:28.631 --> 00:22:29.660
<v Speaker 5>it wouldn't make any sense to anybody.</v>

917
00:22:29.661 --> 00:22:30.450
<v Speaker 5>Is a bunch of lines.</v>

918
00:22:30.450 --> 00:22:31.350
<v Speaker 5>Do you know who would buy it?</v>

919
00:22:31.530 --> 00:22:32.363
<v Speaker 5>That'd be dope.</v>

920
00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:33.960
<v Speaker 5>Maybe a coffee table book.</v>

921
00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:35.220
<v Speaker 5>I'll send you some lines</v>

922
00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:41.090
<v Speaker 5>for a coffee table or maybe I,</v>

923
00:22:41.150 --> 00:22:43.080
<v Speaker 5>I don't think I have enough volume for that kind of thing either,</v>

924
00:22:43.081 --> 00:22:43.771
<v Speaker 5>but maybe someday.</v>

925
00:22:43.771 --> 00:22:43.991
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

926
00:22:43.991 --> 00:22:44.660
<v Speaker 5>if I didn't,</v>

927
00:22:44.660 --> 00:22:44.871
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

928
00:22:44.871 --> 00:22:47.850
<v Speaker 1>I've really think there'll be a dope coffee table book your map,</v>

929
00:22:48.030 --> 00:22:49.000
<v Speaker 1>a little roots and stuff.</v>

930
00:22:49.010 --> 00:22:51.650
<v Speaker 1>You're just musings on life and a in a book for,</v>

931
00:22:51.651 --> 00:22:52.670
<v Speaker 1>I think people would see and be like,</v>

932
00:22:52.671 --> 00:22:53.630
<v Speaker 1>what the F no,</v>

933
00:22:53.631 --> 00:22:55.850
<v Speaker 1>with photographs of the actual mountain itself.</v>

934
00:22:56.060 --> 00:22:57.040
<v Speaker 1>I think that would actually be,</v>

935
00:22:57.050 --> 00:22:57.291
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

936
00:22:57.291 --> 00:22:57.800
<v Speaker 1>if it was,</v>

937
00:22:57.800 --> 00:22:58.280
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

938
00:22:58.280 --> 00:23:00.200
<v Speaker 1>if it was interspersed with real photos,</v>

939
00:23:00.201 --> 00:23:01.550
<v Speaker 1>like this is what it corresponds to.</v>

940
00:23:01.551 --> 00:23:01.850
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>

941
00:23:01.850 --> 00:23:02.091
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

942
00:23:02.091 --> 00:23:02.571
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you,</v>

943
00:23:02.571 --> 00:23:02.930
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

944
00:23:02.930 --> 00:23:04.010
<v Speaker 1>I don't even climb.</v>

945
00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:04.910
<v Speaker 1>I would buy that shit,</v>

946
00:23:05.170 --> 00:23:05.890
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

947
00:23:05.890 --> 00:23:06.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

948
00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:07.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you.</v>

949
00:23:07.010 --> 00:23:08.540
<v Speaker 1>That's a golden opportunity.</v>

950
00:23:08.570 --> 00:23:09.201
<v Speaker 1>Jump on it.</v>

951
00:23:09.201 --> 00:23:11.240
<v Speaker 1>Publishers find this young man.</v>

952
00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:13.493
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

953
00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:14.540
<v Speaker 1>have you ever been wrong?</v>

954
00:23:14.541 --> 00:23:17.990
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever done like a route and said,</v>

955
00:23:17.991 --> 00:23:18.171
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

956
00:23:18.171 --> 00:23:19.970
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go solo it now and been like,</v>

957
00:23:19.971 --> 00:23:20.361
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

958
00:23:20.361 --> 00:23:20.810
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

959
00:23:20.810 --> 00:23:21.591
<v Speaker 1>this is an error.</v>

960
00:23:21.591 --> 00:23:22.490
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't have done this.</v>

961
00:23:23.420 --> 00:23:23.740
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

962
00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:24.720
<v Speaker 5>not so much.</v>

963
00:23:24.790 --> 00:23:25.860
<v Speaker 5>I've had a handful,</v>

964
00:23:25.870 --> 00:23:26.111
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

965
00:23:26.111 --> 00:23:27.040
<v Speaker 5>I wouldn't call it an error,</v>

966
00:23:27.041 --> 00:23:29.560
<v Speaker 5>but I've had a handful of times where I've gone out to solo something without</v>

967
00:23:29.570 --> 00:23:30.700
<v Speaker 5>pre-inspection where I'm just like,</v>

968
00:23:30.701 --> 00:23:30.781
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

969
00:23:30.781 --> 00:23:32.260
<v Speaker 5>I'm just going to go up it and see how it goes.</v>

970
00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:34.210
<v Speaker 5>And I go maybe halfway up and I'm just like,</v>

971
00:23:34.211 --> 00:23:34.501
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

972
00:23:34.501 --> 00:23:35.410
<v Speaker 5>I'm not feeling it.</v>

973
00:23:35.411 --> 00:23:36.370
<v Speaker 5>And then I just calmed back down.</v>

974
00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:37.771
<v Speaker 1>So do you,</v>

975
00:23:37.771 --> 00:23:38.160
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

976
00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:42.030
<v Speaker 1>proceed if you know for sure that you can't climb back down because you can't</v>

977
00:23:42.031 --> 00:23:42.864
<v Speaker 1>always,</v>

978
00:23:42.930 --> 00:23:43.950
<v Speaker 1>can you always climb back?</v>

979
00:23:43.951 --> 00:23:44.341
<v Speaker 1>Generally?</v>

980
00:23:44.341 --> 00:23:46.370
<v Speaker 1>I can climb back almost always,</v>

981
00:23:46.490 --> 00:23:49.490
<v Speaker 5>almost in the end if I know that I'm about to like pass the point where there's</v>

982
00:23:49.491 --> 00:23:50.390
<v Speaker 5>like no,</v>

983
00:23:50.510 --> 00:23:52.250
<v Speaker 5>no turning back then,</v>

984
00:23:52.251 --> 00:23:52.461
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

985
00:23:52.461 --> 00:23:54.680
<v Speaker 5>I sorta know that that's a big deal and I think about it,</v>

986
00:23:54.681 --> 00:23:54.831
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

987
00:23:54.831 --> 00:23:58.520
<v Speaker 5>I think it through because on a 60 minutes piece that was actually something</v>

988
00:23:58.521 --> 00:23:59.090
<v Speaker 5>that I,</v>

989
00:23:59.090 --> 00:23:59.281
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

990
00:23:59.281 --> 00:24:00.520
<v Speaker 5>the narrator who was talking about like,</v>

991
00:24:00.550 --> 00:24:00.651
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

992
00:24:00.651 --> 00:24:01.484
<v Speaker 5>he can't correct.</v>

993
00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:01.731
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

994
00:24:01.731 --> 00:24:02.181
<v Speaker 5>actually I saw,</v>

995
00:24:02.181 --> 00:24:03.020
<v Speaker 5>I just had lunch with them.</v>

996
00:24:03.021 --> 00:24:04.500
<v Speaker 5>He's the guy I was hanging out with it and uh,</v>

997
00:24:04.670 --> 00:24:05.503
<v Speaker 5>and um,</v>

998
00:24:05.630 --> 00:24:06.890
<v Speaker 5>whatever Venice or wherever it was.</v>

999
00:24:07.310 --> 00:24:07.521
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

1000
00:24:07.521 --> 00:24:08.354
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1001
00:24:08.570 --> 00:24:08.901
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1002
00:24:08.901 --> 00:24:09.501
<v Speaker 5>well I don't know.</v>

1003
00:24:09.501 --> 00:24:10.700
<v Speaker 5>So he was a big,</v>

1004
00:24:10.701 --> 00:24:13.550
<v Speaker 5>big climber in the 70s and he established a lot of those routes and all that.</v>

1005
00:24:14.470 --> 00:24:14.811
<v Speaker 5>And I mean,</v>

1006
00:24:14.811 --> 00:24:16.730
<v Speaker 5>I know what he means that it is harder to down climb,</v>

1007
00:24:16.731 --> 00:24:18.560
<v Speaker 5>but the thing is like nowadays,</v>

1008
00:24:18.561 --> 00:24:21.140
<v Speaker 5>I mean I don't know our practice down climb and like I could down calm that,</v>

1009
00:24:21.550 --> 00:24:21.831
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1010
00:24:21.831 --> 00:24:22.430
<v Speaker 5>for sure.</v>

1011
00:24:22.430 --> 00:24:23.380
<v Speaker 5>So I use just hating,</v>

1012
00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:24.081
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

1013
00:24:24.081 --> 00:24:25.160
<v Speaker 5>he wasn't hating but like,</v>

1014
00:24:25.490 --> 00:24:27.020
<v Speaker 5>but from his perspective,</v>

1015
00:24:27.050 --> 00:24:28.610
<v Speaker 5>people don't down calm and stuff like that.</v>

1016
00:24:29.610 --> 00:24:31.520
<v Speaker 5>Maybe he was a little bit of hyperbole.</v>

1017
00:24:31.550 --> 00:24:31.791
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1018
00:24:31.791 --> 00:24:32.624
<v Speaker 5>a little bit,</v>

1019
00:24:32.690 --> 00:24:32.961
<v Speaker 5>but not,</v>

1020
00:24:32.961 --> 00:24:33.141
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1021
00:24:33.141 --> 00:24:34.760
<v Speaker 5>I'm pretty sure the route on 60 minutes.</v>

1022
00:24:34.761 --> 00:24:35.900
<v Speaker 5>Like if I absolutely had to,</v>

1023
00:24:35.901 --> 00:24:37.910
<v Speaker 5>I could have hiked to the top and then down climb the thing,</v>

1024
00:24:38.030 --> 00:24:38.670
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1025
00:24:38.670 --> 00:24:39.261
<v Speaker 5>it could have been like,</v>

1026
00:24:39.261 --> 00:24:39.381
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

1027
00:24:39.381 --> 00:24:40.670
<v Speaker 5>we're filming it in reverse,</v>

1028
00:24:40.730 --> 00:24:41.030
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1029
00:24:41.030 --> 00:24:41.450
<v Speaker 5>shit,</v>

1030
00:24:41.450 --> 00:24:42.770
<v Speaker 5>it would be a lot less rad like that.</v>

1031
00:24:42.970 --> 00:24:43.311
<v Speaker 5>He'd be like,</v>

1032
00:24:43.311 --> 00:24:44.220
<v Speaker 5>that's fucking stupid,</v>

1033
00:24:44.221 --> 00:24:45.290
<v Speaker 5>that guy coming down the mountain,</v>

1034
00:24:46.110 --> 00:24:46.341
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

1035
00:24:46.341 --> 00:24:48.170
<v Speaker 5>But it's still just as scary,</v>

1036
00:24:48.171 --> 00:24:49.080
<v Speaker 5>but I see what you're saying.</v>

1037
00:24:49.081 --> 00:24:50.630
<v Speaker 5>Like it doesn't give you that satisfaction.</v>

1038
00:24:50.631 --> 00:24:50.880
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1039
00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:51.300
<v Speaker 5>exactly.</v>

1040
00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:52.330
<v Speaker 5>Climbing up the mountain,</v>

1041
00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:55.510
<v Speaker 5>you do a really hard hike and then you freaking do extremely dangerous down</v>

1042
00:24:55.511 --> 00:24:55.850
<v Speaker 5>climb.</v>

1043
00:24:55.850 --> 00:24:57.860
<v Speaker 5>If you ever climb to the top of something and then realize,</v>

1044
00:24:57.861 --> 00:24:58.694
<v Speaker 5>Holy Shit,</v>

1045
00:24:58.780 --> 00:24:59.180
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1046
00:24:59.180 --> 00:25:01.130
<v Speaker 5>I have to climb down because I can't walk down.</v>

1047
00:25:01.130 --> 00:25:03.740
<v Speaker 5>There's no other way to get down a little bit.</v>

1048
00:25:03.741 --> 00:25:05.600
<v Speaker 5>I've had a handful of like epics like that.</v>

1049
00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:08.410
<v Speaker 5>But yeah,</v>

1050
00:25:08.570 --> 00:25:12.470
<v Speaker 5>a couple of my gnarliest experiences have been a topping out routes that you</v>

1051
00:25:12.471 --> 00:25:14.000
<v Speaker 5>conventionally a repel down.</v>

1052
00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:15.440
<v Speaker 5>But since I don't have a robe on me,</v>

1053
00:25:15.441 --> 00:25:15.831
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

1054
00:25:15.831 --> 00:25:16.131
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

1055
00:25:16.131 --> 00:25:18.080
<v Speaker 5>I'll just pioneer some kind of new descent.</v>

1056
00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:19.273
<v Speaker 5>And um,</v>

1057
00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:21.170
<v Speaker 5>so a couple of them involve,</v>

1058
00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:22.820
<v Speaker 5>do you know Zion National Park in Utah?</v>

1059
00:25:23.060 --> 00:25:24.520
<v Speaker 5>It's like a really Pretty River Canyon.</v>

1060
00:25:24.530 --> 00:25:25.470
<v Speaker 5>It's like sandstones.</v>

1061
00:25:25.490 --> 00:25:26.110
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

1062
00:25:26.110 --> 00:25:26.943
<v Speaker 5>it's beautiful.</v>

1063
00:25:27.110 --> 00:25:27.943
<v Speaker 5>But um,</v>

1064
00:25:28.010 --> 00:25:29.840
<v Speaker 5>it's like a thousand foot wall.</v>

1065
00:25:30.110 --> 00:25:33.020
<v Speaker 5>And then the rim of the Canyon is like 2000 feet above it and it's a really,</v>

1066
00:25:33.021 --> 00:25:34.070
<v Speaker 5>really steep sandstone.</v>

1067
00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:37.310
<v Speaker 5>And normally you would climb a thousand feet and then repelled back down and be</v>

1068
00:25:37.311 --> 00:25:37.461
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

1069
00:25:37.461 --> 00:25:37.581
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

1070
00:25:37.581 --> 00:25:38.180
<v Speaker 5>sweet.</v>

1071
00:25:38.180 --> 00:25:41.060
<v Speaker 5>So I climbed the thousand foot wall and then I'm up there and it's like 2000</v>

1072
00:25:41.061 --> 00:25:44.520
<v Speaker 5>feet are really steep and it was all covered in like snow or it sorta like</v>

1073
00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:46.070
<v Speaker 5>consolidated hail is all messed up.</v>

1074
00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:46.670
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1075
00:25:46.670 --> 00:25:48.020
<v Speaker 5>super hard to scramble and you know,</v>

1076
00:25:48.021 --> 00:25:49.610
<v Speaker 5>cause they're like roads anyway.</v>

1077
00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:51.830
<v Speaker 5>And then it started snowing as soon as I hop out.</v>

1078
00:25:52.220 --> 00:25:56.250
<v Speaker 5>And so I was like clawing my way up this hail in like this driving blizzard and</v>

1079
00:25:56.251 --> 00:25:56.871
<v Speaker 5>I it actually,</v>

1080
00:25:56.871 --> 00:25:58.880
<v Speaker 5>and then that blizzard while you were up there.</v>

1081
00:25:59.030 --> 00:25:59.391
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1082
00:25:59.391 --> 00:25:59.661
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1083
00:25:59.661 --> 00:26:01.700
<v Speaker 5>so the day that I decided to do,</v>

1084
00:26:01.701 --> 00:26:02.330
<v Speaker 5>I was,</v>

1085
00:26:02.330 --> 00:26:03.500
<v Speaker 5>I was a little angst for and I was like,</v>

1086
00:26:03.501 --> 00:26:07.220
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to do this goddammit and hold it at the time is like last,</v>

1087
00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:08.690
<v Speaker 5>this is the last February a year ago.</v>

1088
00:26:09.110 --> 00:26:09.943
<v Speaker 5>But um,</v>

1089
00:26:10.190 --> 00:26:10.880
<v Speaker 5>but uh,</v>

1090
00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:13.790
<v Speaker 5>so the forecast that there is going to start snowing at noon and I was like,</v>

1091
00:26:13.791 --> 00:26:14.360
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1092
00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:15.140
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1093
00:26:15.140 --> 00:26:15.980
<v Speaker 5>I'll finish by then.</v>

1094
00:26:16.050 --> 00:26:16.761
<v Speaker 5>So I finished it.</v>

1095
00:26:16.761 --> 00:26:18.110
<v Speaker 5>I finished at like 1130.</v>

1096
00:26:18.380 --> 00:26:20.930
<v Speaker 5>It started snowing right on schedule and I was like,</v>

1097
00:26:20.931 --> 00:26:21.501
<v Speaker 5>oh no problem.</v>

1098
00:26:21.501 --> 00:26:22.071
<v Speaker 5>I'll hike off.</v>

1099
00:26:22.071 --> 00:26:22.431
<v Speaker 5>The thing is,</v>

1100
00:26:22.431 --> 00:26:23.750
<v Speaker 5>even once I made it to the rim,</v>

1101
00:26:23.780 --> 00:26:25.070
<v Speaker 5>which took me forever and it was,</v>

1102
00:26:25.071 --> 00:26:27.320
<v Speaker 5>I was getting pretty wet and pretty cold and it was kind of messed up and</v>

1103
00:26:27.321 --> 00:26:28.340
<v Speaker 5>visibility was so low,</v>

1104
00:26:28.341 --> 00:26:29.300
<v Speaker 5>I was worried about getting lost.</v>

1105
00:26:29.630 --> 00:26:30.770
<v Speaker 5>And then once you're up on the top,</v>

1106
00:26:30.771 --> 00:26:31.940
<v Speaker 5>it's just a big plateau.</v>

1107
00:26:31.970 --> 00:26:35.150
<v Speaker 5>And I was hoping to hit this one trail that it was like a 10 mile hike on the</v>

1108
00:26:35.151 --> 00:26:37.310
<v Speaker 5>trail back around to get back to the car.</v>

1109
00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:38.260
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

1110
00:26:38.260 --> 00:26:41.480
<v Speaker 5>even though it's all just a field of snow and like whiteout blizzard style and I</v>

1111
00:26:41.481 --> 00:26:43.440
<v Speaker 5>was just running along in my climbing shoes like,</v>

1112
00:26:43.441 --> 00:26:43.681
<v Speaker 5>God,</v>

1113
00:26:43.681 --> 00:26:44.760
<v Speaker 5>I Hope I can find something.</v>

1114
00:26:44.970 --> 00:26:47.460
<v Speaker 5>But miraculously I found the trail and made it all the way out and there's no</v>

1115
00:26:47.461 --> 00:26:47.790
<v Speaker 5>problem.</v>

1116
00:26:47.790 --> 00:26:49.100
<v Speaker 5>Oh Shit.</v>

1117
00:26:49.330 --> 00:26:51.890
<v Speaker 5>But as you apply yourself and all these experiences he has pretty at,</v>

1118
00:26:51.891 --> 00:26:53.280
<v Speaker 5>that was a satellite phone?</v>

1119
00:26:53.281 --> 00:26:53.401
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1120
00:26:53.401 --> 00:26:53.940
<v Speaker 5>nothing.</v>

1121
00:26:53.940 --> 00:26:54.773
<v Speaker 5>Satellite phone.</v>

1122
00:26:56.390 --> 00:26:57.810
<v Speaker 5>Why would I have a satellite phone?</v>

1123
00:26:57.860 --> 00:26:59.400
<v Speaker 5>The climate at the top of a mountain.</v>

1124
00:26:59.700 --> 00:26:59.911
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1125
00:26:59.911 --> 00:27:00.241
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1126
00:27:00.241 --> 00:27:01.100
<v Speaker 5>well the,</v>

1127
00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:02.430
<v Speaker 5>the thing with that though is like,</v>

1128
00:27:02.431 --> 00:27:03.241
<v Speaker 5>so the whole time I did,</v>

1129
00:27:03.241 --> 00:27:03.571
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

1130
00:27:03.571 --> 00:27:04.710
<v Speaker 5>this is hardcore.</v>

1131
00:27:04.710 --> 00:27:05.260
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1132
00:27:05.260 --> 00:27:06.510
<v Speaker 5>and then as soon as I was back at the car,</v>

1133
00:27:06.511 --> 00:27:07.230
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

1134
00:27:07.230 --> 00:27:07.680
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1135
00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:08.700
<v Speaker 5>it's like noon.</v>

1136
00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:10.680
<v Speaker 5>I had a very eventful morning,</v>

1137
00:27:10.681 --> 00:27:11.131
<v Speaker 5>but like,</v>

1138
00:27:11.131 --> 00:27:12.360
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't even feel like a full day,</v>

1139
00:27:12.361 --> 00:27:12.781
<v Speaker 5>you know what I mean?</v>

1140
00:27:12.781 --> 00:27:13.281
<v Speaker 5>The whole thing,</v>

1141
00:27:13.281 --> 00:27:15.300
<v Speaker 5>like the whole thing like feels surreal because you're like,</v>

1142
00:27:15.301 --> 00:27:16.110
<v Speaker 5>did I just do that?</v>

1143
00:27:16.110 --> 00:27:16.291
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

1144
00:27:16.291 --> 00:27:17.124
<v Speaker 5>that was weird.</v>

1145
00:27:17.170 --> 00:27:18.750
<v Speaker 5>You only took a few hours where you're just like,</v>

1146
00:27:18.810 --> 00:27:19.410
<v Speaker 5>whoa.</v>

1147
00:27:19.410 --> 00:27:20.340
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

1148
00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:22.890
<v Speaker 5>Was that the most harrowing experience you've ever been on?</v>

1149
00:27:22.950 --> 00:27:23.221
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

1150
00:27:23.221 --> 00:27:23.551
<v Speaker 5>For sure.</v>

1151
00:27:23.551 --> 00:27:23.701
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1152
00:27:23.701 --> 00:27:24.121
<v Speaker 5>but it was,</v>

1153
00:27:24.121 --> 00:27:24.890
<v Speaker 5>but it for sure.</v>

1154
00:27:24.890 --> 00:27:25.291
<v Speaker 5>What was it?</v>

1155
00:27:25.291 --> 00:27:26.400
<v Speaker 5>Very invigorating morning,</v>

1156
00:27:26.430 --> 00:27:27.263
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1157
00:27:29.310 --> 00:27:32.010
<v Speaker 5>what is the most hair raising experience you've ever had?</v>

1158
00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:32.970
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

1159
00:27:32.970 --> 00:27:33.803
<v Speaker 5>I dunno,</v>

1160
00:27:33.810 --> 00:27:34.570
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1161
00:27:34.570 --> 00:27:35.370
<v Speaker 5>it depends what you call her,</v>

1162
00:27:35.370 --> 00:27:35.820
<v Speaker 5>raising.</v>

1163
00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:37.560
<v Speaker 5>What's the most difficult climb you've ever done?</v>

1164
00:27:39.270 --> 00:27:39.980
<v Speaker 5>I Dunno.</v>

1165
00:27:39.980 --> 00:27:40.813
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1166
00:27:41.660 --> 00:27:41.941
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1167
00:27:41.941 --> 00:27:42.331
<v Speaker 5>again,</v>

1168
00:27:42.331 --> 00:27:42.600
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1169
00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:44.190
<v Speaker 5>I need like tighter definitions.</v>

1170
00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:45.030
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1171
00:27:45.030 --> 00:27:45.480
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1172
00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:49.530
<v Speaker 5>has there ever been a climb that you did where you,</v>

1173
00:27:49.531 --> 00:27:50.430
<v Speaker 5>you realize like,</v>

1174
00:27:50.431 --> 00:27:50.731
<v Speaker 5>wow,</v>

1175
00:27:50.731 --> 00:27:54.420
<v Speaker 5>that might have been the most strenuous,</v>

1176
00:27:54.450 --> 00:27:56.310
<v Speaker 5>the hardest I've ever had to work?</v>

1177
00:27:56.570 --> 00:27:57.060
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1178
00:27:57.060 --> 00:27:57.691
<v Speaker 5>I have not yet.</v>

1179
00:27:57.691 --> 00:27:57.871
<v Speaker 5>Shit,</v>

1180
00:27:57.871 --> 00:27:58.570
<v Speaker 5>my pants docker,</v>

1181
00:27:58.570 --> 00:27:59.403
<v Speaker 5>I'm close,</v>

1182
00:27:59.460 --> 00:28:02.430
<v Speaker 5>but I'm so for free soloing maybe.</v>

1183
00:28:02.431 --> 00:28:03.264
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1184
00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:05.100
<v Speaker 5>the first time I free soloed half to him,</v>

1185
00:28:05.190 --> 00:28:06.420
<v Speaker 5>which was in 2008.</v>

1186
00:28:06.421 --> 00:28:08.310
<v Speaker 5>I think at the time.</v>

1187
00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:10.380
<v Speaker 5>I think it was maybe a little bit much for me.</v>

1188
00:28:10.770 --> 00:28:11.011
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1189
00:28:11.011 --> 00:28:12.120
<v Speaker 5>like when I finished I was like,</v>

1190
00:28:12.150 --> 00:28:12.983
<v Speaker 5>Ooh,</v>

1191
00:28:13.140 --> 00:28:14.820
<v Speaker 5>maybe not that I like got away with it,</v>

1192
00:28:14.821 --> 00:28:15.840
<v Speaker 5>but that's kind of the feeling,</v>

1193
00:28:15.841 --> 00:28:15.991
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1194
00:28:15.991 --> 00:28:17.040
<v Speaker 5>you get to the top and you're like,</v>

1195
00:28:17.041 --> 00:28:17.874
<v Speaker 5>Whoa,</v>

1196
00:28:18.820 --> 00:28:19.710
<v Speaker 5>we are for sure.</v>

1197
00:28:19.711 --> 00:28:20.490
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

1198
00:28:20.490 --> 00:28:20.731
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1199
00:28:20.731 --> 00:28:23.900
<v Speaker 5>because the one of the hardest and least secure parts of the whole climb is up</v>

1200
00:28:23.901 --> 00:28:24.600
<v Speaker 5>at the very top.</v>

1201
00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:26.730
<v Speaker 5>So you're at like the top of a 2000 foot wall.</v>

1202
00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:28.073
<v Speaker 5>And um,</v>

1203
00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:30.630
<v Speaker 5>and it took me like two 50 to climb the whole route.</v>

1204
00:28:30.631 --> 00:28:34.250
<v Speaker 5>So I was probably up there at two 35 at this like super hard part.</v>

1205
00:28:34.260 --> 00:28:35.910
<v Speaker 5>I'm already kind of frazzled and you know,</v>

1206
00:28:35.911 --> 00:28:38.730
<v Speaker 5>because you've been really focused for like two and a half hours,</v>

1207
00:28:38.731 --> 00:28:41.010
<v Speaker 5>like trying really hard and you're just getting a little tired and whatever,</v>

1208
00:28:41.460 --> 00:28:43.800
<v Speaker 5>and then you get to the hardest part that's also the least secure.</v>

1209
00:28:43.801 --> 00:28:45.090
<v Speaker 5>It's a really insecure style.</v>

1210
00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:46.780
<v Speaker 5>It's like they're no actual holds to hold on to it.</v>

1211
00:28:46.781 --> 00:28:49.100
<v Speaker 5>It's just like a bald slab that,</v>

1212
00:28:49.101 --> 00:28:51.030
<v Speaker 5>and you just wait your feet and so,</v>

1213
00:28:51.031 --> 00:28:51.270
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1214
00:28:51.270 --> 00:28:52.290
<v Speaker 5>you just have to eat your feet.</v>

1215
00:28:52.291 --> 00:28:53.670
<v Speaker 5>What do you mean means like,</v>

1216
00:28:53.671 --> 00:28:55.050
<v Speaker 5>so you're wearing really tight climbing shoes.</v>

1217
00:28:55.051 --> 00:28:57.540
<v Speaker 5>It's like really precise edges on them and you basically just,</v>

1218
00:28:57.840 --> 00:29:01.140
<v Speaker 5>it'd be like if you took that brick wall and you like leaned it back and made it</v>

1219
00:29:01.141 --> 00:29:03.810
<v Speaker 5>a little smoother and then all you can do is stand on the little edges of the</v>

1220
00:29:03.811 --> 00:29:04.644
<v Speaker 5>bricks,</v>

1221
00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:05.580
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1222
00:29:05.580 --> 00:29:06.200
<v Speaker 5>actually,</v>

1223
00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:08.550
<v Speaker 5>well if you tilt it it back to like 87 degrees.</v>

1224
00:29:08.820 --> 00:29:11.490
<v Speaker 5>You could probably walk up that wall with no hands but just the edges,</v>

1225
00:29:11.491 --> 00:29:11.790
<v Speaker 5>you know.</v>

1226
00:29:11.790 --> 00:29:13.530
<v Speaker 5>But it would chill around about that.</v>

1227
00:29:13.531 --> 00:29:16.380
<v Speaker 5>You would look at this wall and start thinking about roots.</v>

1228
00:29:16.790 --> 00:29:20.570
<v Speaker 5>Well you see a wall and look for areas I love little bit,</v>

1229
00:29:20.670 --> 00:29:21.503
<v Speaker 5>a little bit.</v>

1230
00:29:21.540 --> 00:29:24.930
<v Speaker 5>Is there a difference between that guy who does your type of stuff like mountain</v>

1231
00:29:24.931 --> 00:29:27.660
<v Speaker 5>climbing stuff and those crazy dudes or climb buildings?</v>

1232
00:29:28.460 --> 00:29:28.680
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1233
00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:30.180
<v Speaker 5>I mean he's still just climbing stuff.</v>

1234
00:29:30.270 --> 00:29:31.530
<v Speaker 5>Deep practice on the floor.</v>

1235
00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:33.360
<v Speaker 5>Do you like practice climbing on the floor?</v>

1236
00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:35.580
<v Speaker 5>Would that be called laying down?</v>

1237
00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:38.081
<v Speaker 5>I mean like,</v>

1238
00:29:38.081 --> 00:29:38.260
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

1239
00:29:38.260 --> 00:29:38.441
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

1240
00:29:38.441 --> 00:29:40.440
<v Speaker 5>like would Brian shut the fuck up?</v>

1241
00:29:40.740 --> 00:29:41.170
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

1242
00:29:41.170 --> 00:29:42.610
<v Speaker 5>I do push back.</v>

1243
00:29:42.620 --> 00:29:44.650
<v Speaker 5>How do you,</v>

1244
00:29:44.651 --> 00:29:44.860
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1245
00:29:44.860 --> 00:29:45.700
<v Speaker 5>do you have like a,</v>

1246
00:29:45.710 --> 00:29:49.420
<v Speaker 5>a strength or conditioning program that you did a bunch of us do a lot of,</v>

1247
00:29:49.930 --> 00:29:51.190
<v Speaker 5>a little bit when I'm motivated.</v>

1248
00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:52.660
<v Speaker 5>Like I did a bunch of planks this morning,</v>

1249
00:29:52.790 --> 00:29:53.680
<v Speaker 5>but I don't know.</v>

1250
00:29:53.710 --> 00:29:54.910
<v Speaker 5>Does it help your climbing?</v>

1251
00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:55.640
<v Speaker 5>I Dunno,</v>

1252
00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:56.140
<v Speaker 5>that's the,</v>

1253
00:29:56.140 --> 00:29:56.771
<v Speaker 5>that's the thing.</v>

1254
00:29:56.771 --> 00:29:58.600
<v Speaker 5>But I mean it makes my core is wrong if you're,</v>

1255
00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:00.340
<v Speaker 5>if you're climbing has done right.</v>

1256
00:30:00.341 --> 00:30:02.770
<v Speaker 5>How much of it actually does involve physical strength?</v>

1257
00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:03.580
<v Speaker 5>A fair,</v>

1258
00:30:03.580 --> 00:30:04.320
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1259
00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:05.040
<v Speaker 5>a fair amount,</v>

1260
00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:05.590
<v Speaker 5>fair amount.</v>

1261
00:30:05.590 --> 00:30:06.423
<v Speaker 5>Eventually.</v>

1262
00:30:06.550 --> 00:30:08.380
<v Speaker 5>The thing you said what I was just talking about a slab,</v>

1263
00:30:08.420 --> 00:30:08.691
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1264
00:30:08.691 --> 00:30:11.590
<v Speaker 5>that's all about technique and precision with footwork and all that kind of</v>

1265
00:30:11.591 --> 00:30:11.751
<v Speaker 5>thing.</v>

1266
00:30:11.751 --> 00:30:12.700
<v Speaker 5>That's all mental and,</v>

1267
00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:14.890
<v Speaker 5>and I mean you have to have toned calves or whatever,</v>

1268
00:30:15.250 --> 00:30:16.083
<v Speaker 5>but um,</v>

1269
00:30:16.210 --> 00:30:18.970
<v Speaker 5>but then if you tip a wall back the other way and you're climbing out,</v>

1270
00:30:18.971 --> 00:30:20.980
<v Speaker 5>so I'm kind of like overhanging ceiling then.</v>

1271
00:30:20.981 --> 00:30:21.251
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1272
00:30:21.251 --> 00:30:23.350
<v Speaker 5>it really does come down to having strong arms and strong.</v>

1273
00:30:23.940 --> 00:30:24.390
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1274
00:30:24.390 --> 00:30:25.223
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1275
00:30:25.330 --> 00:30:26.111
<v Speaker 5>I mean in general,</v>

1276
00:30:26.111 --> 00:30:27.160
<v Speaker 5>for a recreational climber,</v>

1277
00:30:27.161 --> 00:30:29.470
<v Speaker 5>you should be using your feet and you should be using good technique and you</v>

1278
00:30:29.471 --> 00:30:30.910
<v Speaker 5>should keep your weight over your legs.</v>

1279
00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:31.571
<v Speaker 5>But,</v>

1280
00:30:31.571 --> 00:30:31.840
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1281
00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:33.430
<v Speaker 5>but when you get into really high end climbing,</v>

1282
00:30:33.431 --> 00:30:33.781
<v Speaker 5>it's like,</v>

1283
00:30:33.781 --> 00:30:34.080
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1284
00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:34.540
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1285
00:30:34.540 --> 00:30:36.080
<v Speaker 5>you just gotta be able to pull really hard too.</v>

1286
00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:41.980
<v Speaker 5>I saw a video or a photograph of you holding onto some pillars or some beams and</v>

1287
00:30:41.981 --> 00:30:42.551
<v Speaker 5>doing chin.</v>

1288
00:30:42.551 --> 00:30:43.180
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah,</v>

1289
00:30:43.180 --> 00:30:43.870
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1290
00:30:43.870 --> 00:30:44.230
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

1291
00:30:44.230 --> 00:30:45.063
<v Speaker 5>Can you do that?</v>

1292
00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:45.850
<v Speaker 5>You really can.</v>

1293
00:30:45.850 --> 00:30:47.380
<v Speaker 5>You can work as a photo of it.</v>

1294
00:30:47.610 --> 00:30:52.610
<v Speaker 5>I mean if the beacon actually Ergonomic flop and move and not just hold there.</v>

1295
00:30:53.950 --> 00:30:54.341
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1296
00:30:54.341 --> 00:30:54.641
<v Speaker 5>I was,</v>

1297
00:30:54.641 --> 00:30:54.891
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1298
00:30:54.891 --> 00:30:56.860
<v Speaker 5>I could do like two pull ups on those BMC for,</v>

1299
00:30:56.861 --> 00:30:57.694
<v Speaker 5>I'd fall over.</v>

1300
00:30:58.090 --> 00:30:59.650
<v Speaker 5>I mean it was really hard for me to hold on to them.</v>

1301
00:30:59.980 --> 00:31:00.161
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1302
00:31:00.161 --> 00:31:00.970
<v Speaker 5>I would imagine though.</v>

1303
00:31:00.970 --> 00:31:03.250
<v Speaker 5>But that's gotta be pretty rare that someone can even do it too.</v>

1304
00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:04.031
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1305
00:31:04.031 --> 00:31:06.670
<v Speaker 5>but I mean there are plenty of dudes who were a lot stronger and that kind of</v>

1306
00:31:06.671 --> 00:31:09.030
<v Speaker 5>thing that I am is that uh,</v>

1307
00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:13.600
<v Speaker 5>cause I've heard crazy stories about these free solo climber is being able to do</v>

1308
00:31:13.601 --> 00:31:16.750
<v Speaker 5>chin ups with one finger and a thing.</v>

1309
00:31:17.050 --> 00:31:17.883
<v Speaker 5>You can do that.</v>

1310
00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:18.610
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1311
00:31:18.610 --> 00:31:19.900
<v Speaker 5>right now I could probably do two,</v>

1312
00:31:20.050 --> 00:31:20.883
<v Speaker 5>two fingers.</v>

1313
00:31:21.340 --> 00:31:24.360
<v Speaker 5>When I was a kid I could do like a one finger one on I think not in to one</v>

1314
00:31:24.370 --> 00:31:24.731
<v Speaker 5>finger,</v>

1315
00:31:24.731 --> 00:31:25.211
<v Speaker 5>one arm,</v>

1316
00:31:25.211 --> 00:31:26.044
<v Speaker 5>Chin up.</v>

1317
00:31:26.350 --> 00:31:26.621
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1318
00:31:26.621 --> 00:31:27.760
<v Speaker 5>I mean hanging off like a slang,</v>

1319
00:31:27.761 --> 00:31:27.971
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1320
00:31:27.971 --> 00:31:29.140
<v Speaker 5>like a little piece of rope or something.</v>

1321
00:31:29.230 --> 00:31:31.000
<v Speaker 5>That's the photo of you hanging in there.</v>

1322
00:31:31.110 --> 00:31:31.943
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

1323
00:31:32.110 --> 00:31:32.291
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1324
00:31:32.291 --> 00:31:33.430
<v Speaker 5>Classic that Ah,</v>

1325
00:31:33.431 --> 00:31:34.660
<v Speaker 5>that chalk stuff's huge,</v>

1326
00:31:34.661 --> 00:31:35.290
<v Speaker 5>Huh?</v>

1327
00:31:35.290 --> 00:31:35.471
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1328
00:31:35.471 --> 00:31:35.651
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

1329
00:31:35.651 --> 00:31:37.870
<v Speaker 5>I mean the same as gymnast and everything keeps your hands dry.</v>

1330
00:31:37.930 --> 00:31:38.171
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1331
00:31:38.171 --> 00:31:40.270
<v Speaker 5>You do you ever Solo something without chalk?</v>

1332
00:31:40.300 --> 00:31:41.770
<v Speaker 5>You look at it and like I'm going to need chalk for that.</v>

1333
00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:42.221
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

1334
00:31:42.221 --> 00:31:42.491
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

1335
00:31:42.491 --> 00:31:45.730
<v Speaker 5>You pretty much always take a chalk bag unless it's like real easy and I'm just</v>

1336
00:31:45.731 --> 00:31:46.564
<v Speaker 5>scrambling up it.</v>

1337
00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:47.860
<v Speaker 5>Have you ever lost a chalk bag?</v>

1338
00:31:47.890 --> 00:31:48.541
<v Speaker 5>I have actually.</v>

1339
00:31:48.541 --> 00:31:49.360
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

1340
00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:52.200
<v Speaker 5>if it's funny you ask this last summer,</v>

1341
00:31:52.210 --> 00:31:54.790
<v Speaker 5>like one of the biggest things that I've done solving the triple,</v>

1342
00:31:54.791 --> 00:31:57.370
<v Speaker 5>which was like climbing in three big faces and he's 17 in a day.</v>

1343
00:31:57.880 --> 00:31:58.713
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1344
00:31:58.840 --> 00:32:01.320
<v Speaker 5>the second thing that I climbed was El Capitan,</v>

1345
00:32:01.350 --> 00:32:02.560
<v Speaker 5>just like a 3000 foot face.</v>

1346
00:32:02.561 --> 00:32:03.860
<v Speaker 5>And I climbed it through the night and accident.</v>

1347
00:32:03.890 --> 00:32:06.210
<v Speaker 5>I forgot my chalk bag at the bottom and I was like,</v>

1348
00:32:06.330 --> 00:32:07.030
<v Speaker 5>God,</v>

1349
00:32:07.030 --> 00:32:07.241
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

1350
00:32:07.241 --> 00:32:08.760
<v Speaker 5>And so when I was all ready to start climbing,</v>

1351
00:32:08.780 --> 00:32:09.210
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

1352
00:32:09.210 --> 00:32:09.980
<v Speaker 5>ah,</v>

1353
00:32:09.980 --> 00:32:10.690
<v Speaker 5>damn it,</v>

1354
00:32:10.690 --> 00:32:11.170
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

1355
00:32:11.170 --> 00:32:13.720
<v Speaker 5>And actually it was kind of messed up cause the root was kind of wet because it</v>

1356
00:32:13.721 --> 00:32:15.070
<v Speaker 5>rained a lot the day before.</v>

1357
00:32:15.430 --> 00:32:16.750
<v Speaker 5>And so it's the kind of thing where you like,</v>

1358
00:32:16.751 --> 00:32:17.980
<v Speaker 5>you really want to chalk bag.</v>

1359
00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:19.210
<v Speaker 5>But um,</v>

1360
00:32:19.210 --> 00:32:19.631
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

1361
00:32:19.631 --> 00:32:20.590
<v Speaker 5>well bummer.</v>

1362
00:32:20.591 --> 00:32:21.100
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1363
00:32:21.100 --> 00:32:23.680
<v Speaker 5>and then I did the first 800 feet and then I actually passed a party.</v>

1364
00:32:23.681 --> 00:32:26.380
<v Speaker 5>He was sleeping on the route because most people climbing over like four days.</v>

1365
00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:27.273
<v Speaker 5>What?</v>

1366
00:32:27.580 --> 00:32:27.851
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1367
00:32:27.851 --> 00:32:29.190
<v Speaker 5>Well I mean a 3000 foot faces.</v>

1368
00:32:29.220 --> 00:32:29.890
<v Speaker 5>So you've,</v>

1369
00:32:29.890 --> 00:32:33.940
<v Speaker 5>you saw a guy that was like camped out on one of those crazy outcropping tents.</v>

1370
00:32:34.390 --> 00:32:34.631
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1371
00:32:34.631 --> 00:32:34.941
<v Speaker 5>that was,</v>

1372
00:32:34.941 --> 00:32:35.140
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1373
00:32:35.140 --> 00:32:35.771
<v Speaker 5>they were actually,</v>

1374
00:32:35.771 --> 00:32:36.011
<v Speaker 5>it was,</v>

1375
00:32:36.011 --> 00:32:37.240
<v Speaker 5>so it's kind of a standard ledge.</v>

1376
00:32:37.241 --> 00:32:38.940
<v Speaker 5>It's like where people generally camp on the roads of,</v>

1377
00:32:39.740 --> 00:32:41.690
<v Speaker 5>well it's like the size of half this table,</v>

1378
00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:42.651
<v Speaker 5>you know what I mean?</v>

1379
00:32:42.651 --> 00:32:43.310
<v Speaker 5>So it's like,</v>

1380
00:32:43.310 --> 00:32:44.240
<v Speaker 5>but so there were two parties,</v>

1381
00:32:44.241 --> 00:32:44.900
<v Speaker 5>the two guys,</v>

1382
00:32:44.900 --> 00:32:47.630
<v Speaker 5>and they were all camped on it and so they each had their little tents that</v>

1383
00:32:47.631 --> 00:32:48.464
<v Speaker 5>you're talking about.</v>

1384
00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:49.010
<v Speaker 5>So that,</v>

1385
00:32:49.010 --> 00:32:49.311
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1386
00:32:49.311 --> 00:32:50.270
<v Speaker 5>cause there's not much room,</v>

1387
00:32:50.390 --> 00:32:52.910
<v Speaker 5>so it's half the size of this table and everybody's on it.</v>

1388
00:32:52.911 --> 00:32:53.744
<v Speaker 5>And the big party.</v>

1389
00:32:53.810 --> 00:32:54.230
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1390
00:32:54.230 --> 00:32:56.540
<v Speaker 5>But that's pretty comfortable converted hanging on a vertical face,</v>

1391
00:32:56.541 --> 00:32:56.730
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

1392
00:32:56.730 --> 00:32:57.110
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1393
00:32:57.110 --> 00:32:57.381
<v Speaker 5>You're like,</v>

1394
00:32:57.381 --> 00:32:57.771
<v Speaker 5>oh sweet,</v>

1395
00:32:57.771 --> 00:32:58.361
<v Speaker 5>I can stand,</v>

1396
00:32:58.361 --> 00:32:59.540
<v Speaker 5>you can take off your harness if you want,</v>

1397
00:32:59.930 --> 00:33:00.560
<v Speaker 5>whatever.</v>

1398
00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:01.080
<v Speaker 5>Anyway though,</v>

1399
00:33:01.080 --> 00:33:01.600
<v Speaker 5>it's our past,</v>

1400
00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:02.610
<v Speaker 5>these dudes in the middle of the night,</v>

1401
00:33:02.611 --> 00:33:04.640
<v Speaker 5>you were camping there and the guy gave me a chalk bag and I was like,</v>

1402
00:33:04.820 --> 00:33:05.880
<v Speaker 5>oh wow.</v>

1403
00:33:05.910 --> 00:33:06.950
<v Speaker 5>So then when I got to the top,</v>

1404
00:33:06.951 --> 00:33:08.250
<v Speaker 5>I tied out after this little tree,</v>

1405
00:33:08.251 --> 00:33:09.320
<v Speaker 5>so then he got it back later.</v>

1406
00:33:09.890 --> 00:33:10.371
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

1407
00:33:10.371 --> 00:33:10.530
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1408
00:33:10.530 --> 00:33:11.363
<v Speaker 5>that's pretty cool.</v>

1409
00:33:11.390 --> 00:33:12.200
<v Speaker 5>So it's like,</v>

1410
00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:13.370
<v Speaker 5>so you just kept going,</v>

1411
00:33:13.371 --> 00:33:13.950
<v Speaker 5>you climbed the,</v>

1412
00:33:13.950 --> 00:33:14.690
<v Speaker 5>the whole thing.</v>

1413
00:33:14.690 --> 00:33:15.940
<v Speaker 5>And once you got the chalk bag,</v>

1414
00:33:15.941 --> 00:33:16.550
<v Speaker 5>you're like,</v>

1415
00:33:16.550 --> 00:33:17.420
<v Speaker 5>then it was game on,</v>

1416
00:33:17.421 --> 00:33:18.254
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

1417
00:33:19.190 --> 00:33:20.270
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God,</v>

1418
00:33:20.271 --> 00:33:21.620
<v Speaker 5>what did they say to you when you're like,</v>

1419
00:33:21.621 --> 00:33:22.550
<v Speaker 5>I forgot my chalk.</v>

1420
00:33:22.551 --> 00:33:23.940
<v Speaker 5>We like what the fuck man.</v>

1421
00:33:24.230 --> 00:33:24.651
<v Speaker 5>Little bit.</v>

1422
00:33:24.651 --> 00:33:25.490
<v Speaker 5>I think they were like,</v>

1423
00:33:25.670 --> 00:33:26.503
<v Speaker 5>Huh?</v>

1424
00:33:27.860 --> 00:33:29.540
<v Speaker 5>The fact that they were up there for like five days,</v>

1425
00:33:29.541 --> 00:33:30.140
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1426
00:33:30.140 --> 00:33:32.210
<v Speaker 5>and that this dude climbs through and he's like,</v>

1427
00:33:32.450 --> 00:33:32.871
<v Speaker 5>excuse me,</v>

1428
00:33:32.871 --> 00:33:33.740
<v Speaker 5>do you have any chalk?</v>

1429
00:33:33.770 --> 00:33:34.310
<v Speaker 5>And they were like,</v>

1430
00:33:34.310 --> 00:33:36.240
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck is this guy going know?</v>

1431
00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:39.860
<v Speaker 5>But I actually saw,</v>

1432
00:33:39.861 --> 00:33:40.710
<v Speaker 5>I met that guy again.</v>

1433
00:33:41.550 --> 00:33:44.240
<v Speaker 5>I think that's his favorite story because I've probably met like half the</v>

1434
00:33:44.241 --> 00:33:45.200
<v Speaker 5>climbers on the west coast.</v>

1435
00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:45.381
<v Speaker 5>You're like,</v>

1436
00:33:45.381 --> 00:33:46.100
<v Speaker 5>hey you,</v>

1437
00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:47.330
<v Speaker 5>you met my buddy Steve.</v>

1438
00:33:47.331 --> 00:33:47.781
<v Speaker 5>He gave me,</v>

1439
00:33:47.781 --> 00:33:48.890
<v Speaker 5>you gave him this chalk bag,</v>

1440
00:33:48.891 --> 00:33:50.360
<v Speaker 5>whatever gave you his chalk bag.</v>

1441
00:33:50.570 --> 00:33:52.280
<v Speaker 5>I've met like a dozen people who were like,</v>

1442
00:33:52.281 --> 00:33:52.461
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>

1443
00:33:52.461 --> 00:33:53.450
<v Speaker 5>I met this guy that,</v>

1444
00:33:53.510 --> 00:33:54.320
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1445
00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:55.450
<v Speaker 5>I think there are a pretty sight,</v>

1446
00:33:55.470 --> 00:33:55.671
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1447
00:33:55.671 --> 00:33:56.780
<v Speaker 5>just cause it's a funny story.</v>

1448
00:33:56.930 --> 00:33:57.151
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1449
00:33:57.151 --> 00:33:58.400
<v Speaker 5>it's a very funny story.</v>

1450
00:33:58.401 --> 00:33:59.840
<v Speaker 5>It's a very crazy story though,</v>

1451
00:33:59.841 --> 00:34:00.200
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

1452
00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:04.820
<v Speaker 5>Just your reality is your reality to you.</v>

1453
00:34:04.821 --> 00:34:06.050
<v Speaker 5>It's just normal.</v>

1454
00:34:06.051 --> 00:34:06.231
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1455
00:34:06.231 --> 00:34:06.341
<v Speaker 5>Cause,</v>

1456
00:34:06.341 --> 00:34:06.980
<v Speaker 5>I mean that's,</v>

1457
00:34:06.980 --> 00:34:07.850
<v Speaker 5>that's normal.</v>

1458
00:34:07.970 --> 00:34:08.571
<v Speaker 5>But I'm serious.</v>

1459
00:34:08.571 --> 00:34:09.291
<v Speaker 5>I'm talking to you.</v>

1460
00:34:09.291 --> 00:34:10.400
<v Speaker 5>My hands are sweaty.</v>

1461
00:34:10.730 --> 00:34:11.563
<v Speaker 5>I get sweaty,</v>

1462
00:34:11.660 --> 00:34:15.710
<v Speaker 5>I think about high heights and I get like the butterfly thing.</v>

1463
00:34:15.711 --> 00:34:18.020
<v Speaker 5>I could think about it being like high up,</v>

1464
00:34:18.350 --> 00:34:19.183
<v Speaker 5>I can do that.</v>

1465
00:34:19.240 --> 00:34:20.120
<v Speaker 5>I freak myself out.</v>

1466
00:34:20.270 --> 00:34:23.270
<v Speaker 5>Do you look at like when you're at a building and so do you think are in</v>

1467
00:34:23.271 --> 00:34:25.400
<v Speaker 5>climates pitch do you to look at things like that?</v>

1468
00:34:25.700 --> 00:34:25.971
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

1469
00:34:25.971 --> 00:34:26.211
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1470
00:34:26.211 --> 00:34:27.470
<v Speaker 5>buildings I do look at and I'm like,</v>

1471
00:34:27.471 --> 00:34:29.210
<v Speaker 5>oh that'd be rad except you get arrested.</v>

1472
00:34:29.211 --> 00:34:30.470
<v Speaker 5>So I kind of nipped that in the bud,</v>

1473
00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:31.430
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

1474
00:34:31.430 --> 00:34:32.420
<v Speaker 5>But with rocks for sure.</v>

1475
00:34:32.421 --> 00:34:34.000
<v Speaker 5>I mean you see some things,</v>

1476
00:34:34.030 --> 00:34:34.341
<v Speaker 5>you just,</v>

1477
00:34:34.341 --> 00:34:34.671
<v Speaker 5>you're like,</v>

1478
00:34:34.671 --> 00:34:36.230
<v Speaker 5>that looks red and I'd love to climb that.</v>

1479
00:34:36.231 --> 00:34:39.020
<v Speaker 5>Two climbers ever do things like that for publicity stunts.</v>

1480
00:34:39.021 --> 00:34:41.000
<v Speaker 5>Like know that they're going to get arrested but just climb something.</v>

1481
00:34:41.001 --> 00:34:41.270
<v Speaker 5>Anyone?</v>

1482
00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:41.341
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1483
00:34:41.341 --> 00:34:42.830
<v Speaker 5>I mean surely you've heard of,</v>

1484
00:34:42.890 --> 00:34:44.920
<v Speaker 5>I don't want her bear the Alhambra bear,</v>

1485
00:34:44.930 --> 00:34:48.020
<v Speaker 5>the French solos guy who did the New York Times building and it's like climbed</v>

1486
00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:49.550
<v Speaker 5>pretty much every skyscraper in the world.</v>

1487
00:34:49.790 --> 00:34:50.451
<v Speaker 5>You know what?</v>

1488
00:34:50.451 --> 00:34:52.040
<v Speaker 5>Probably peripherally.</v>

1489
00:34:52.041 --> 00:34:52.791
<v Speaker 5>I've heard of that guy,</v>

1490
00:34:52.791 --> 00:34:56.150
<v Speaker 5>but I've never talked to you when you talking about dude Solon and skyscrapers,</v>

1491
00:34:56.450 --> 00:34:58.460
<v Speaker 5>he's the only dude long skyscrapers.</v>

1492
00:34:58.490 --> 00:34:58.731
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1493
00:34:58.731 --> 00:35:00.560
<v Speaker 5>Like any skyscraper you've heard of being solid.</v>

1494
00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:01.370
<v Speaker 5>It's that guy.</v>

1495
00:35:01.370 --> 00:35:03.140
<v Speaker 5>And they don't lock them up for one.</v>

1496
00:35:03.170 --> 00:35:03.351
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1497
00:35:03.351 --> 00:35:03.531
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

1498
00:35:03.531 --> 00:35:05.360
<v Speaker 5>I mean he's been arrested and tons of times,</v>

1499
00:35:05.361 --> 00:35:07.850
<v Speaker 5>like you talked that you talked about some building in Japan.</v>

1500
00:35:07.851 --> 00:35:09.740
<v Speaker 5>He got punched in the face by a security guard.</v>

1501
00:35:10.660 --> 00:35:11.060
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1502
00:35:11.060 --> 00:35:12.260
<v Speaker 5>he's had all kinds of weird stories.</v>

1503
00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:13.100
<v Speaker 5>But um,</v>

1504
00:35:13.100 --> 00:35:16.010
<v Speaker 5>I met him in Poland at this film festival thing last year and I was like,</v>

1505
00:35:16.011 --> 00:35:16.470
<v Speaker 5>oh that's,</v>

1506
00:35:16.470 --> 00:35:19.070
<v Speaker 5>it's great to meet him actually because he was like a really good climber,</v>

1507
00:35:19.250 --> 00:35:22.190
<v Speaker 5>like in the eighties and nineties and then he sort of transitioned into,</v>

1508
00:35:22.191 --> 00:35:22.401
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

1509
00:35:22.401 --> 00:35:22.790
<v Speaker 5>he,</v>

1510
00:35:22.790 --> 00:35:24.500
<v Speaker 5>he doesn't even call himself a climber anymore.</v>

1511
00:35:24.501 --> 00:35:24.981
<v Speaker 5>He's just like,</v>

1512
00:35:24.981 --> 00:35:25.161
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

1513
00:35:25.161 --> 00:35:25.560
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1514
00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:26.391
<v Speaker 5>just climb buildings.</v>

1515
00:35:26.391 --> 00:35:26.781
<v Speaker 5>It's fun.</v>

1516
00:35:26.781 --> 00:35:27.081
<v Speaker 5>Whatever.</v>

1517
00:35:27.081 --> 00:35:27.914
<v Speaker 5>It's like as a job.</v>

1518
00:35:28.370 --> 00:35:30.670
<v Speaker 5>But so does he sell books or does dude,</v>

1519
00:35:30.710 --> 00:35:30.891
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1520
00:35:30.891 --> 00:35:32.210
<v Speaker 5>he does like speaking stuff.</v>

1521
00:35:32.211 --> 00:35:35.780
<v Speaker 5>Apparently books like some of the buildings that he gets paid for it because you</v>

1522
00:35:35.781 --> 00:35:35.871
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>

1523
00:35:35.871 --> 00:35:39.450
<v Speaker 5>like in the Middle East they like unveil like the biggest building in the world</v>

1524
00:35:39.451 --> 00:35:41.560
<v Speaker 5>or whatever and then they pay him to climate and you know,</v>

1525
00:35:42.610 --> 00:35:43.030
<v Speaker 5>whenever,</v>

1526
00:35:43.030 --> 00:35:43.260
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1527
00:35:43.260 --> 00:35:44.090
<v Speaker 5>there was a guy,</v>

1528
00:35:44.090 --> 00:35:44.361
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1529
00:35:44.361 --> 00:35:45.210
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if it was him,</v>

1530
00:35:45.211 --> 00:35:47.310
<v Speaker 5>but someone was doing something recently.</v>

1531
00:35:47.370 --> 00:35:48.240
<v Speaker 5>It was on the news,</v>

1532
00:35:48.270 --> 00:35:50.580
<v Speaker 5>I just slipped was walking through an airport or something and the guy had</v>

1533
00:35:50.581 --> 00:35:52.630
<v Speaker 5>suction cups and it's climbing up some fucking night.</v>

1534
00:35:54.090 --> 00:35:55.800
<v Speaker 5>Tom Cruise in mission impossible.</v>

1535
00:35:56.730 --> 00:35:57.690
<v Speaker 5>I don't think so.</v>

1536
00:35:57.720 --> 00:35:59.070
<v Speaker 5>I think it was an actual real person.</v>

1537
00:35:59.490 --> 00:35:59.870
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1538
00:35:59.870 --> 00:36:02.000
<v Speaker 5>Some guy he didn't think that should exist in,</v>

1539
00:36:02.070 --> 00:36:02.421
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1540
00:36:02.421 --> 00:36:02.611
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1541
00:36:02.611 --> 00:36:03.090
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

1542
00:36:03.090 --> 00:36:03.800
<v Speaker 5>Oh it does.</v>

1543
00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:04.201
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

1544
00:36:04.201 --> 00:36:07.500
<v Speaker 5>He was climbing up a glass building and he was using suction cups.</v>

1545
00:36:07.770 --> 00:36:08.603
<v Speaker 5>You can,</v>

1546
00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:09.451
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1547
00:36:09.451 --> 00:36:11.190
<v Speaker 5>you can actually do it seems like it'd be scary.</v>

1548
00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:11.461
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1549
00:36:11.461 --> 00:36:12.091
<v Speaker 5>it was real scary.</v>

1550
00:36:12.091 --> 00:36:12.924
<v Speaker 5>He was also,</v>

1551
00:36:13.510 --> 00:36:15.650
<v Speaker 5>one time it was another video of another building and get out.</v>

1552
00:36:15.660 --> 00:36:17.430
<v Speaker 5>He was in a crack like this,</v>

1553
00:36:17.431 --> 00:36:22.431
<v Speaker 5>like it was like a v crack going smaller as it got away from him and he was</v>

1554
00:36:22.561 --> 00:36:23.650
<v Speaker 5>climbing the wall that way.</v>

1555
00:36:23.651 --> 00:36:25.920
<v Speaker 5>It just pressing up against the wall and climbing that way.</v>

1556
00:36:26.790 --> 00:36:28.140
<v Speaker 5>There's probably a set standard,</v>

1557
00:36:28.350 --> 00:36:29.400
<v Speaker 5>like a standard technique.</v>

1558
00:36:29.430 --> 00:36:29.671
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1559
00:36:29.671 --> 00:36:30.180
<v Speaker 5>for sure.</v>

1560
00:36:30.180 --> 00:36:32.070
<v Speaker 5>Do you ever get yourself in a situation like that where that's how you're</v>

1561
00:36:32.071 --> 00:36:32.461
<v Speaker 5>climbing,</v>

1562
00:36:32.461 --> 00:36:36.840
<v Speaker 5>you're pressing up against the wall and that's actually a lot easier probably</v>

1563
00:36:36.841 --> 00:36:38.280
<v Speaker 5>than it might look to you really.</v>

1564
00:36:38.550 --> 00:36:39.061
<v Speaker 5>Probably.</v>

1565
00:36:39.061 --> 00:36:39.271
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1566
00:36:39.271 --> 00:36:41.580
<v Speaker 5>generally when you're doing any kind of counter pressure type stuff like that,</v>

1567
00:36:41.581 --> 00:36:42.510
<v Speaker 5>like pushing two sides,</v>

1568
00:36:42.511 --> 00:36:42.721
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1569
00:36:42.721 --> 00:36:44.940
<v Speaker 5>you're using your whole body as opposed to just your fingers.</v>

1570
00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:45.330
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

1571
00:36:45.330 --> 00:36:46.270
<v Speaker 5>So I mean it's not that,</v>

1572
00:36:46.350 --> 00:36:47.183
<v Speaker 5>not that strenuous,</v>

1573
00:36:47.730 --> 00:36:49.020
<v Speaker 5>depending on how,</v>

1574
00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:50.160
<v Speaker 5>what the angle is and everything.</v>

1575
00:36:50.500 --> 00:36:51.120
<v Speaker 5>My God.</v>

1576
00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:54.600
<v Speaker 5>But we know how little kids loved to like chimney up like doorframes were</v>

1577
00:36:54.601 --> 00:36:55.380
<v Speaker 5>hallways or whatever.</v>

1578
00:36:55.380 --> 00:36:55.681
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

1579
00:36:55.681 --> 00:36:57.840
<v Speaker 5>You know where you put your backhands one side of your feet together.</v>

1580
00:36:57.841 --> 00:36:58.021
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1581
00:36:58.021 --> 00:36:58.770
<v Speaker 5>that's pretty,</v>

1582
00:36:58.770 --> 00:37:00.720
<v Speaker 5>pretty stable and you know,</v>

1583
00:37:00.721 --> 00:37:01.554
<v Speaker 5>it's easy to do.</v>

1584
00:37:02.990 --> 00:37:03.420
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1585
00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:04.230
<v Speaker 5>what is that?</v>

1586
00:37:04.230 --> 00:37:05.640
<v Speaker 5>Here's the guy saying he's got the,</v>

1587
00:37:05.770 --> 00:37:06.041
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

1588
00:37:06.041 --> 00:37:06.360
<v Speaker 2>that's it.</v>

1589
00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:06.881
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

1590
00:37:06.881 --> 00:37:08.970
<v Speaker 2>That line we're bear does he has suction cups up?</v>

1591
00:37:09.020 --> 00:37:09.220
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1592
00:37:09.220 --> 00:37:10.053
<v Speaker 2>not in this one.</v>

1593
00:37:10.060 --> 00:37:11.260
<v Speaker 2>But that's actually quite easy.</v>

1594
00:37:11.261 --> 00:37:11.601
<v Speaker 2>I mean he,</v>

1595
00:37:11.601 --> 00:37:12.730
<v Speaker 2>he can go now hands right,</v>

1596
00:37:12.970 --> 00:37:13.391
<v Speaker 2>right there.</v>

1597
00:37:13.391 --> 00:37:14.224
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1598
00:37:14.290 --> 00:37:17.290
<v Speaker 2>so then when he has to do the movements in between levels,</v>

1599
00:37:17.291 --> 00:37:18.124
<v Speaker 2>this is insane.</v>

1600
00:37:18.230 --> 00:37:19.330
<v Speaker 2>You think this looks easy?</v>

1601
00:37:19.380 --> 00:37:20.213
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1602
00:37:21.970 --> 00:37:22.630
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

1603
00:37:22.630 --> 00:37:24.640
<v Speaker 2>I mean not that I'm diminishing as accomplishment,</v>

1604
00:37:24.641 --> 00:37:25.001
<v Speaker 2>but like,</v>

1605
00:37:25.001 --> 00:37:28.540
<v Speaker 2>but that particular like feet of climbing does not look hard at all.</v>

1606
00:37:28.810 --> 00:37:29.470
<v Speaker 2>You should be an,</v>

1607
00:37:29.470 --> 00:37:30.580
<v Speaker 2>you should become a tagger.</v>

1608
00:37:30.610 --> 00:37:34.900
<v Speaker 2>You'd be like the ultimate tagger but that goes back to what not when you got</v>

1609
00:37:34.901 --> 00:37:35.321
<v Speaker 2>arrested,</v>

1610
00:37:35.321 --> 00:37:36.154
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1611
00:37:36.750 --> 00:37:39.120
<v Speaker 2>you dress up as Spiderman or some bitch.</v>

1612
00:37:39.410 --> 00:37:39.611
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1613
00:37:39.611 --> 00:37:40.220
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

1614
00:37:40.220 --> 00:37:41.053
<v Speaker 2>Put that</v>

1615
00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:43.570
<v Speaker 5>totally like Carrie paint with you and stuff.</v>

1616
00:37:43.571 --> 00:37:44.404
<v Speaker 5>So knowing,</v>

1617
00:37:44.740 --> 00:37:46.090
<v Speaker 5>fuck up your whole balance thing.</v>

1618
00:37:46.120 --> 00:37:46.271
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1619
00:37:46.271 --> 00:37:46.760
<v Speaker 5>exactly right.</v>

1620
00:37:46.760 --> 00:37:49.060
<v Speaker 5>It's just a sticker called bucket hanging off me.</v>

1621
00:37:49.860 --> 00:37:51.070
<v Speaker 5>Alan Bro Bear Guy.</v>

1622
00:37:52.060 --> 00:37:55.740
<v Speaker 5>He started off doing the regular climbing and just decided this,</v>

1623
00:37:55.750 --> 00:37:56.650
<v Speaker 5>no money in this shit.</v>

1624
00:37:57.100 --> 00:37:57.341
<v Speaker 5>Actually,</v>

1625
00:37:57.341 --> 00:37:58.270
<v Speaker 5>I think part of it was that,</v>

1626
00:37:58.271 --> 00:37:58.810
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1627
00:37:58.810 --> 00:38:02.380
<v Speaker 5>he had a couple of kind of terrible ground falls where like he felt so alone and</v>

1628
00:38:02.390 --> 00:38:04.360
<v Speaker 5>it got all messed up like different things.</v>

1629
00:38:04.770 --> 00:38:05.071
<v Speaker 5>And so,</v>

1630
00:38:05.071 --> 00:38:05.290
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1631
00:38:05.290 --> 00:38:08.060
<v Speaker 5>I think he now has like a summer restricted range of motion.</v>

1632
00:38:08.080 --> 00:38:09.550
<v Speaker 5>I can't move his arms in certain ways.</v>

1633
00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:10.411
<v Speaker 5>And so,</v>

1634
00:38:10.411 --> 00:38:11.170
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1635
00:38:11.170 --> 00:38:11.381
<v Speaker 5>so,</v>

1636
00:38:11.381 --> 00:38:14.230
<v Speaker 5>so long on rock is kind of out of the question a little bit because rock</v>

1637
00:38:14.231 --> 00:38:17.260
<v Speaker 5>requires like real rock requires such a diverse range of movements cause you</v>

1638
00:38:17.261 --> 00:38:19.450
<v Speaker 5>never know like where the holes are going to be or what direction they'll be</v>

1639
00:38:19.451 --> 00:38:20.230
<v Speaker 5>facing.</v>

1640
00:38:20.230 --> 00:38:21.820
<v Speaker 5>Where's buildings are extremely uniform.</v>

1641
00:38:22.060 --> 00:38:22.430
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1642
00:38:22.430 --> 00:38:22.720
<v Speaker 5>But you know,</v>

1643
00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:23.570
<v Speaker 5>say like with a building,</v>

1644
00:38:23.580 --> 00:38:23.691
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1645
00:38:23.691 --> 00:38:24.610
<v Speaker 5>he can look at it and be like,</v>

1646
00:38:24.611 --> 00:38:24.821
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

1647
00:38:24.821 --> 00:38:26.620
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to be like that little clip you just saw.</v>

1648
00:38:26.621 --> 00:38:30.040
<v Speaker 5>He did that exact same movement over and over for a thousand feet or however big</v>

1649
00:38:30.041 --> 00:38:30.874
<v Speaker 5>that building is.</v>

1650
00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:31.641
<v Speaker 5>So Tito,</v>

1651
00:38:31.641 --> 00:38:32.670
<v Speaker 5>so this is like,</v>

1652
00:38:33.100 --> 00:38:35.290
<v Speaker 5>I guess it's just another example,</v>

1653
00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:36.080
<v Speaker 5>something</v>

1654
00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:38.180
<v Speaker 3>where if you don't know how to do it,</v>

1655
00:38:38.181 --> 00:38:39.014
<v Speaker 3>it looks impossible.</v>

1656
00:38:41.330 --> 00:38:42.680
<v Speaker 3>I should know that by now.</v>

1657
00:38:43.580 --> 00:38:45.650
<v Speaker 3>Is it every guest that you have on like that,</v>

1658
00:38:45.680 --> 00:38:45.921
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1659
00:38:45.921 --> 00:38:47.210
<v Speaker 3>where you're like astrophysics?</v>

1660
00:38:47.240 --> 00:38:47.630
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1661
00:38:47.630 --> 00:38:48.291
<v Speaker 3>Crazy.</v>

1662
00:38:48.291 --> 00:38:48.621
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1663
00:38:48.621 --> 00:38:51.950
<v Speaker 3>Like actually it's real boring study physics.</v>

1664
00:38:52.820 --> 00:38:54.230
<v Speaker 3>Astrophysics is boring.</v>

1665
00:38:54.260 --> 00:38:55.071
<v Speaker 3>That hasn't,</v>

1666
00:38:55.071 --> 00:38:55.821
<v Speaker 3>but I know what you're saying.</v>

1667
00:38:55.821 --> 00:38:56.121
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1668
00:38:56.121 --> 00:38:56.601
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

1669
00:38:56.601 --> 00:38:57.620
<v Speaker 3>It becomes commonplace.</v>

1670
00:38:58.140 --> 00:39:00.390
<v Speaker 3>They didn't come from what you do and then they should or something.</v>

1671
00:39:00.391 --> 00:39:00.741
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>

1672
00:39:00.741 --> 00:39:01.100
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1673
00:39:01.100 --> 00:39:01.970
<v Speaker 3>punch people in the face.</v>

1674
00:39:02.060 --> 00:39:02.271
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1675
00:39:02.271 --> 00:39:03.740
<v Speaker 3>I don't really hit him that much.</v>

1676
00:39:03.770 --> 00:39:05.440
<v Speaker 3>Most of what I do is Jujitsu these days.</v>

1677
00:39:05.460 --> 00:39:06.800
<v Speaker 3>So you throw them into a wall.</v>

1678
00:39:06.860 --> 00:39:07.870
<v Speaker 3>It's the strangle him.</v>

1679
00:39:08.450 --> 00:39:09.350
<v Speaker 3>Why Mars and stuff.</v>

1680
00:39:09.380 --> 00:39:11.990
<v Speaker 6>Have you ever climbed during a earthquake?</v>

1681
00:39:12.050 --> 00:39:12.790
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>

1682
00:39:12.790 --> 00:39:14.600
<v Speaker 6>or is that a fear of yours?</v>

1683
00:39:14.601 --> 00:39:17.090
<v Speaker 6>Like having like the big earthquake while you're there?</v>

1684
00:39:18.120 --> 00:39:18.960
<v Speaker 3>Fuck a fat one.</v>

1685
00:39:18.961 --> 00:39:19.410
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1686
00:39:19.410 --> 00:39:19.650
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1687
00:39:19.650 --> 00:39:22.350
<v Speaker 3>But see a mountain driving over a bridge and the</v>

1688
00:39:23.930 --> 00:39:24.210
<v Speaker 3>same,</v>

1689
00:39:24.210 --> 00:39:24.510
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1690
00:39:24.510 --> 00:39:27.360
<v Speaker 3>but you were in a car and it's like a movie.</v>

1691
00:39:27.361 --> 00:39:30.330
<v Speaker 3>The car might hit the water and then you can open up a window and you can get</v>

1692
00:39:30.331 --> 00:39:31.164
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>

1693
00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:32.233
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1694
00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:33.593
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1695
00:39:33.900 --> 00:39:34.620
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1696
00:39:34.620 --> 00:39:35.453
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

1697
00:39:35.640 --> 00:39:36.471
<v Speaker 3>but the,</v>

1698
00:39:36.471 --> 00:39:38.250
<v Speaker 3>the connection between the Lick,</v>

1699
00:39:38.251 --> 00:39:39.960
<v Speaker 3>looking at people doing martial arts,</v>

1700
00:39:39.990 --> 00:39:40.130
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

1701
00:39:40.130 --> 00:39:41.390
<v Speaker 3>it totally makes sense to me that,</v>

1702
00:39:41.420 --> 00:39:42.090
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

1703
00:39:42.090 --> 00:39:45.240
<v Speaker 3>Like I watch a video of an ICO master or something like throwing people around</v>

1704
00:39:45.241 --> 00:39:46.860
<v Speaker 3>the word around the room.</v>

1705
00:39:46.870 --> 00:39:47.730
<v Speaker 3>And that was something son,</v>

1706
00:39:47.731 --> 00:39:48.564
<v Speaker 3>most of,</v>

1707
00:39:48.930 --> 00:39:49.231
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1708
00:39:49.231 --> 00:39:50.190
<v Speaker 3>most of that's horse shit.</v>

1709
00:39:50.250 --> 00:39:50.491
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>

1710
00:39:50.491 --> 00:39:54.120
<v Speaker 3>Well I can either read was read a martial art that really works if the other</v>

1711
00:39:54.121 --> 00:39:57.630
<v Speaker 3>person doesn't know anything or if you have no idea what this guy doing or if</v>

1712
00:39:57.631 --> 00:39:58.740
<v Speaker 3>you're cooperating.</v>

1713
00:39:58.920 --> 00:39:59.950
<v Speaker 3>And that's what a lot of it is.</v>

1714
00:39:59.990 --> 00:40:04.710
<v Speaker 3>The videos the guys running at you and he's committing to a very specific</v>

1715
00:40:04.711 --> 00:40:06.720
<v Speaker 3>technique and you're throwing them on the ground,</v>

1716
00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:10.620
<v Speaker 3>but you never see that applied in like a UFC match.</v>

1717
00:40:10.650 --> 00:40:15.120
<v Speaker 3>He very rarely you'll see some of the principles of misdirection and</v>

1718
00:40:15.180 --> 00:40:18.540
<v Speaker 3>manipulating bodies and like throwing bottles with leverage,</v>

1719
00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:21.180
<v Speaker 3>but the way you see it in like in a kito demonstration.</v>

1720
00:40:21.420 --> 00:40:22.890
<v Speaker 3>But Shit never happens in the real world.</v>

1721
00:40:22.891 --> 00:40:23.724
<v Speaker 3>It just doesn't,</v>

1722
00:40:23.730 --> 00:40:24.020
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1723
00:40:24.020 --> 00:40:24.853
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of,</v>

1724
00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:27.210
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of that leftover from,</v>

1725
00:40:27.240 --> 00:40:31.710
<v Speaker 3>there was a time where martial arts had like a great mysticism attached to it,</v>

1726
00:40:32.010 --> 00:40:33.480
<v Speaker 3>but because of the UFC,</v>

1727
00:40:33.481 --> 00:40:35.190
<v Speaker 3>because of mixed martial arts competition,</v>

1728
00:40:35.191 --> 00:40:38.190
<v Speaker 3>it's become much more pragmatic and now they really understand what works and</v>

1729
00:40:38.191 --> 00:40:38.970
<v Speaker 3>what doesn't work.</v>

1730
00:40:38.970 --> 00:40:39.391
<v Speaker 3>So I,</v>

1731
00:40:39.391 --> 00:40:40.920
<v Speaker 3>Kido is one of those martial arts.</v>

1732
00:40:40.921 --> 00:40:43.530
<v Speaker 3>It has some practical application,</v>

1733
00:40:43.740 --> 00:40:48.480
<v Speaker 3>but as a lot of fuckery there's a lot of shit that just doesn't work or apply</v>

1734
00:40:48.490 --> 00:40:49.590
<v Speaker 3>that mindset to climbing.</v>

1735
00:40:50.020 --> 00:40:50.853
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure.</v>

1736
00:40:50.870 --> 00:40:51.660
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

1737
00:40:51.660 --> 00:40:51.871
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1738
00:40:51.871 --> 00:40:56.190
<v Speaker 3>I have friends that watch like a martial arts thing on television.</v>

1739
00:40:56.191 --> 00:40:57.270
<v Speaker 3>Like fuck that guy.</v>

1740
00:40:57.271 --> 00:40:57.781
<v Speaker 3>Just do that.</v>

1741
00:40:57.781 --> 00:40:59.070
<v Speaker 3>And like that's a wheel kick.</v>

1742
00:40:59.071 --> 00:41:00.300
<v Speaker 3>That's like standard technique,</v>

1743
00:41:00.301 --> 00:41:00.800
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1744
00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:04.430
<v Speaker 3>that's how you looking at this flag and that guy is on those two buildings or</v>

1745
00:41:04.440 --> 00:41:05.280
<v Speaker 3>those two sides.</v>

1746
00:41:05.300 --> 00:41:06.390
<v Speaker 3>Like that's uniform.</v>

1747
00:41:06.391 --> 00:41:07.470
<v Speaker 3>That's a hanger that's,</v>

1748
00:41:07.530 --> 00:41:09.530
<v Speaker 3>he does nothing to do.</v>

1749
00:41:10.920 --> 00:41:11.820
<v Speaker 3>Everyone's got their thing.</v>

1750
00:41:11.821 --> 00:41:15.360
<v Speaker 3>You know that some people don't have their things so they should find their</v>

1751
00:41:15.361 --> 00:41:15.571
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

1752
00:41:15.571 --> 00:41:16.151
<v Speaker 3>They should knit,</v>

1753
00:41:16.151 --> 00:41:16.410
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1754
00:41:16.410 --> 00:41:17.430
<v Speaker 3>they should start a garden.</v>

1755
00:41:17.490 --> 00:41:18.810
<v Speaker 3>Like everybody can do something.</v>

1756
00:41:18.870 --> 00:41:20.250
<v Speaker 3>Everybody should have a thing though.</v>

1757
00:41:20.251 --> 00:41:21.630
<v Speaker 3>I completely agree.</v>

1758
00:41:21.660 --> 00:41:23.760
<v Speaker 3>I had a friend who was getting divorced and uh,</v>

1759
00:41:24.090 --> 00:41:24.570
<v Speaker 3>but what,</v>

00:41:24.570 --> 00:41:25.860
<v Speaker 3>that's one of the things he said.</v>

1761
00:41:26.070 --> 00:41:26.641
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

1762
00:41:26.641 --> 00:41:26.880

00:41:29.011 --> 00:41:32.040
<v Speaker 3>I swear to God I'm going to find someone who likes something.</v>

1767
00:41:32.220 --> 00:41:34.060
<v Speaker 3>He goes anything fucking taller</v>

1768
00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:35.510

1773
00:41:43.670 --> 00:41:48.440
<v Speaker 1>It was a fascinating there you really need something to get him out of bed and</v>

1774
00:41:48.590 --> 00:41:49.970
<v Speaker 1>not just to get you out of bed though.</v>

1775
00:41:49.980 --> 00:41:52.160
<v Speaker 1>Just to make it fun where you gotta to be fired up,</v>

1776
00:41:52.490 --> 00:41:52.790

00:41:57.620 --> 00:41:58.371
<v Speaker 1>It really does.</v>

1781
00:41:58.371 --> 00:41:59.720
<v Speaker 1>It affects how you feel.</v>

1782
00:41:59.721 --> 00:42:00.320
<v Speaker 1>It affects site.</v>

1783
00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:02.150
<v Speaker 1>If you have something you really love to do,</v>

1784
00:42:02.420 --> 00:42:05.990
<v Speaker 1>if there's anything I could ever tell anybody that's out there that's young,</v>

1785
00:42:06.200 --> 00:42:09.170
<v Speaker 1>that's like got a lot of people that are telling them to take a safe route.</v>

1786
00:42:09.171 --> 00:42:11.960
<v Speaker 1>Actually there are no young people listening to this young people.</v>

1787
00:42:12.380 --> 00:42:12.691
<v Speaker 1>I hope.</v>

1788
00:42:12.691 --> 00:42:15.890
<v Speaker 1>I hope there are like eight to 14 is our [inaudible].</v>

1789
00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:17.690
<v Speaker 1>We go for 12 year olds.</v>

1790
00:42:17.691 --> 00:42:19.520
<v Speaker 1>12 year olds are more malleable.</v>

1791
00:42:20.420 --> 00:42:21.200
<v Speaker 1>That's fair.</v>

1792
00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:21.510
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

1793
00:42:21.510 --> 00:42:21.920
<v Speaker 1>Oh man,</v>

1794
00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:22.671
<v Speaker 1>it's on the Internet.</v>

1795
00:42:22.671 --> 00:42:24.890
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure there's fucking 12 year olds listening.</v>

1796
00:42:24.920 --> 00:42:27.030
<v Speaker 1>I get emails from 16 year olds all the time.</v>

1797
00:42:27.050 --> 00:42:28.040
<v Speaker 1>Like the curse with kids.</v>

1798
00:42:28.041 --> 00:42:29.630
<v Speaker 1>You know why it's just a word.</v>

1799
00:42:29.660 --> 00:42:31.470
<v Speaker 1>Second year olds are old enough.</v>

1800
00:42:31.630 --> 00:42:32.510
<v Speaker 1>That's that sweet.</v>

1801
00:42:32.780 --> 00:42:33.650
<v Speaker 1>I feel I feel bad.</v>

1802
00:42:33.651 --> 00:42:34.150
<v Speaker 1>A little kid,</v>

1803
00:42:34.150 --> 00:42:36.590
<v Speaker 1>but you shouldn't because they're going to say it when they become adults.</v>

1804
00:42:36.591 --> 00:42:37.371
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

1805
00:42:37.371 --> 00:42:37.790
<v Speaker 1>You should.</v>

1806
00:42:37.790 --> 00:42:41.150
<v Speaker 1>Everybody should say fuck that way for a little bit.</v>

1807
00:42:41.151 --> 00:42:41.660
<v Speaker 1>You don't think?</v>

1808
00:42:41.660 --> 00:42:42.050
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1809
00:42:42.050 --> 00:42:44.150
<v Speaker 1>I say keep using it,</v>

1810
00:42:44.151 --> 00:42:46.130
<v Speaker 1>but use it in moderation.</v>

1811
00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:46.971
<v Speaker 1>No one to use it.</v>

1812
00:42:46.971 --> 00:42:47.480
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1813
00:42:47.480 --> 00:42:48.231
<v Speaker 1>like comedians.</v>

1814
00:42:48.231 --> 00:42:52.020
<v Speaker 1>When comedians used the word fuck too many times you overflow you route.</v>

1815
00:42:52.100 --> 00:42:53.690
<v Speaker 1>It ruins the impact of the word,</v>

1816
00:42:53.691 --> 00:42:56.120
<v Speaker 1>but when you don't use it that often and then you use it,</v>

1817
00:42:56.480 --> 00:42:57.313
<v Speaker 1>boom,</v>

1818
00:42:57.470 --> 00:42:58.303
<v Speaker 1>it works.</v>

1819
00:42:58.340 --> 00:43:00.740
<v Speaker 1>My point is there's nothing wrong with little kids saying,</v>

1820
00:43:00.750 --> 00:43:01.310
<v Speaker 1>fuck it's,</v>

1821
00:43:01.310 --> 00:43:02.143
<v Speaker 1>it's adorable.</v>

1822
00:43:02.710 --> 00:43:04.130
<v Speaker 1>Didn't we've watched that movie.</v>

1823
00:43:04.131 --> 00:43:06.440
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck was that movie with Nicholas Cage?</v>

1824
00:43:06.470 --> 00:43:10.240
<v Speaker 1>The a kick ass kick ass little girl calls over the cons.</v>

1825
00:43:10.630 --> 00:43:11.463
<v Speaker 1>It's beautiful.</v>

1826
00:43:11.860 --> 00:43:13.190
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing wrong with that man.</v>

1827
00:43:13.191 --> 00:43:13.371
<v Speaker 1>We're,</v>

1828
00:43:13.371 --> 00:43:15.440
<v Speaker 1>we're silly people with magic words,</v>

1829
00:43:15.650 --> 00:43:17.480
<v Speaker 1>but if there's anything that you can,</v>

1830
00:43:17.990 --> 00:43:20.390
<v Speaker 1>that young people can hear that can benefit them,</v>

1831
00:43:20.391 --> 00:43:24.200
<v Speaker 1>the big one is do what you're drawn to.</v>

1832
00:43:24.710 --> 00:43:25.970
<v Speaker 1>Whatever you're drawn to.</v>

1833
00:43:26.060 --> 00:43:26.900
<v Speaker 1>Go to that.</v>

1834
00:43:27.380 --> 00:43:31.880
<v Speaker 1>Just find something you love to do because your life will be different than</v>

1835
00:43:31.881 --> 00:43:36.380
<v Speaker 1>someone who just works because we could all get by just working and have hobbies</v>

1836
00:43:36.381 --> 00:43:36.891
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

1837
00:43:36.891 --> 00:43:40.760
<v Speaker 1>and have family and friends that keep us entertained and have people at work</v>

1838
00:43:40.761 --> 00:43:43.970
<v Speaker 1>that we enjoy being around so we can have a good time working.</v>

1839
00:43:43.971 --> 00:43:47.150
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying you don't have a good life if you're a person who works.</v>

1840
00:43:47.330 --> 00:43:51.950
<v Speaker 1>When I'm saying is if you have the choice and you do when you're young,</v>

1841
00:43:51.980 --> 00:43:52.341
<v Speaker 1>you do.</v>

1842
00:43:52.341 --> 00:43:53.270
<v Speaker 1>When you don't have commitments,</v>

1843
00:43:53.271 --> 00:43:53.961
<v Speaker 1>you don't have a mortgage,</v>

1844
00:43:53.961 --> 00:43:54.794
<v Speaker 1>you don't have a family.</v>

1845
00:43:55.280 --> 00:43:57.410
<v Speaker 1>Go do what you fucking love.</v>

1846
00:43:57.500 --> 00:43:58.333
<v Speaker 1>Go there,</v>

1847
00:43:58.340 --> 00:43:59.180
<v Speaker 1>go get,</v>

1848
00:43:59.510 --> 00:44:02.660
<v Speaker 1>find whatever it is because you're a perfect example of that.</v>

1849
00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:05.780
<v Speaker 1>What you do would make me shit my pants every day of the week.</v>

1850
00:44:05.781 --> 00:44:07.190
<v Speaker 1>I have no desire.</v>

1851
00:44:07.420 --> 00:44:08.150
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

1852
00:44:08.150 --> 00:44:10.460
<v Speaker 1>I don't have her look at mountains.</v>

1853
00:44:10.461 --> 00:44:10.671
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

1854
00:44:10.671 --> 00:44:11.211
<v Speaker 1>fuck man,</v>

1855
00:44:11.211 --> 00:44:12.290
<v Speaker 1>I need to climb that shit.</v>

1856
00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:12.801
<v Speaker 1>Never.</v>

1857
00:44:12.801 --> 00:44:13.700
<v Speaker 1>It's not in me.</v>

1858
00:44:13.701 --> 00:44:14.360
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't,</v>

1859
00:44:14.360 --> 00:44:15.470
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't appeal to me.</v>

1860
00:44:15.471 --> 00:44:16.720
<v Speaker 1>I look over the edge of building.</v>

1861
00:44:16.721 --> 00:44:16.970
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1862
00:44:16.970 --> 00:44:19.910
<v Speaker 1>oh well when I fucking run away and hide,</v>

1863
00:44:20.090 --> 00:44:21.650
<v Speaker 1>I am so not into that.</v>

1864
00:44:21.860 --> 00:44:23.840
<v Speaker 1>But I love the fact that you are,</v>

1865
00:44:24.050 --> 00:44:24.381
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1866
00:44:24.381 --> 00:44:28.550
<v Speaker 1>I'd love the fact that people are so different that it's whatever it is,</v>

1867
00:44:28.551 --> 00:44:31.720
<v Speaker 1>or ones and Zeros inside of your make.</v>

1868
00:44:31.720 --> 00:44:34.180
<v Speaker 1>You look at a tree and won a fucking climate.</v>

1869
00:44:34.420 --> 00:44:35.231
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what that is,</v>

1870
00:44:35.231 --> 00:44:36.190
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's awesome.</v>

1871
00:44:36.610 --> 00:44:36.881
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1872
00:44:36.881 --> 00:44:37.391
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

1873
00:44:37.391 --> 00:44:37.631
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1874
00:44:37.631 --> 00:44:39.040
<v Speaker 1>it's shocking and it's weird,</v>

1875
00:44:39.041 --> 00:44:39.731
<v Speaker 1>but it's awesome.</v>

1876
00:44:39.731 --> 00:44:42.610
<v Speaker 1>And it's a perfect example of that principle in action.</v>

1877
00:44:42.850 --> 00:44:44.380
<v Speaker 1>You've always been drawn to climbing.</v>

1878
00:44:44.530 --> 00:44:45.610
<v Speaker 1>You climb and look at you.</v>

1879
00:44:45.611 --> 00:44:46.444
<v Speaker 1>You're happy bastard.</v>

1880
00:44:46.570 --> 00:44:47.210
<v Speaker 1>That's what I was saying,</v>

1881
00:44:47.210 --> 00:44:49.100
<v Speaker 1>that my family's always been surprisingly supportive,</v>

1882
00:44:49.160 --> 00:44:49.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1883
00:44:49.490 --> 00:44:52.240
<v Speaker 1>because I think my mom sort of values exactly what you're saying.</v>

1884
00:44:52.360 --> 00:44:52.900
<v Speaker 1>And she's like,</v>

1885
00:44:52.900 --> 00:44:53.830
<v Speaker 1>that's what he loves to do.</v>

1886
00:44:53.831 --> 00:44:54.371
<v Speaker 1>He's doing it.</v>

1887
00:44:54.371 --> 00:44:55.530
<v Speaker 1>He's working hard at it,</v>

1888
00:44:55.550 --> 00:44:56.081
<v Speaker 1>doing it well,</v>

1889
00:44:56.081 --> 00:44:56.440
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1890
00:44:56.440 --> 00:44:56.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1891
00:44:56.860 --> 00:44:57.910
<v Speaker 1>can't do any better than none.</v>

1892
00:44:58.060 --> 00:44:59.020
<v Speaker 1>You got a cool mom.</v>

1893
00:44:59.040 --> 00:44:59.410
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

1894
00:44:59.410 --> 00:45:00.700
<v Speaker 1>if everybody had a mom like that,</v>

1895
00:45:00.730 --> 00:45:02.020
<v Speaker 1>we would be a better world.</v>

1896
00:45:02.290 --> 00:45:02.900
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1897
00:45:02.900 --> 00:45:03.900
<v Speaker 6>Do you have any fears?</v>

1898
00:45:03.901 --> 00:45:05.000
<v Speaker 6>Like are you scared of Shit Shits?</v>

1899
00:45:05.010 --> 00:45:05.960
<v Speaker 6>Is there anything like that?</v>

1900
00:45:09.800 --> 00:45:10.071
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1901
00:45:10.071 --> 00:45:10.490
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1902
00:45:10.490 --> 00:45:10.851
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>

1903
00:45:10.851 --> 00:45:11.840
<v Speaker 1>Nothing crazy.</v>

1904
00:45:11.841 --> 00:45:12.230
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1905
00:45:12.230 --> 00:45:15.500
<v Speaker 1>my friend's girlfriend has a Arachnophobia like legit,</v>

1906
00:45:15.530 --> 00:45:17.510
<v Speaker 1>like if you say spider around her,</v>

1907
00:45:17.511 --> 00:45:18.830
<v Speaker 1>just say the word spider.</v>

1908
00:45:18.950 --> 00:45:20.540
<v Speaker 1>Her throat starts to close up.</v>

1909
00:45:20.610 --> 00:45:20.961
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

1910
00:45:20.961 --> 00:45:21.800
<v Speaker 1>She can't talk.</v>

1911
00:45:22.550 --> 00:45:23.390
<v Speaker 1>She freaks out.</v>

1912
00:45:24.560 --> 00:45:25.460
<v Speaker 1>You know who it is.</v>

1913
00:45:25.610 --> 00:45:26.660
<v Speaker 1>She was there the other day,</v>

1914
00:45:27.280 --> 00:45:27.520
<v Speaker 6>girl.</v>

1915
00:45:27.520 --> 00:45:27.951
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

1916
00:45:27.951 --> 00:45:29.380
<v Speaker 6>we're watching spider.</v>

1917
00:45:29.650 --> 00:45:29.891
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1918
00:45:29.891 --> 00:45:30.724
<v Speaker 6>You remember that?</v>

1919
00:45:31.100 --> 00:45:35.460
<v Speaker 1>You say the word spider around her who are her throat starts to close La for no</v>

1920
00:45:35.461 --> 00:45:35.851
<v Speaker 1>reason.</v>

1921
00:45:35.851 --> 00:45:36.360
<v Speaker 1>Kind of weird.</v>

1922
00:45:36.360 --> 00:45:36.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1923
00:45:36.840 --> 00:45:37.531
<v Speaker 1>And she has no idea.</v>

1924
00:45:37.531 --> 00:45:39.330
<v Speaker 1>She has no life experience with a spider.</v>

1925
00:45:39.331 --> 00:45:42.950
<v Speaker 1>There's never been any limitations and those spite them all stay shoes and</v>

1926
00:45:42.990 --> 00:45:44.180
<v Speaker 1>molested by a tarantula.</v>

1927
00:45:44.190 --> 00:45:45.023
<v Speaker 1>She was a baby,</v>

1928
00:45:45.170 --> 00:45:45.780
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1929
00:45:45.780 --> 00:45:48.030
<v Speaker 1>I mean would it probably was,</v>

1930
00:45:48.090 --> 00:45:51.600
<v Speaker 1>was I bet someone in her chain of ancestry,</v>

1931
00:45:51.660 --> 00:45:55.560
<v Speaker 1>this is just totally unscientific theory by me.</v>

1932
00:45:55.620 --> 00:45:56.580
<v Speaker 1>Like a daddy long leg.</v>

1933
00:45:56.610 --> 00:46:00.030
<v Speaker 1>I have this idea of genetic memory and it's a shit,</v>

1934
00:46:00.060 --> 00:46:00.301
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1935
00:46:00.301 --> 00:46:02.520
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a scientist so I shouldn't even be talking here,</v>

1936
00:46:02.521 --> 00:46:05.460
<v Speaker 1>but I'm gonna say it anyway cause it's just a thought.</v>

1937
00:46:05.700 --> 00:46:08.820
<v Speaker 1>The idea is that when people have like reincarnations,</v>

1938
00:46:08.850 --> 00:46:09.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1939
00:46:09.240 --> 00:46:09.481
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

1940
00:46:09.481 --> 00:46:09.691
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1941
00:46:09.691 --> 00:46:10.530
<v Speaker 1>people say like,</v>

1942
00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:11.181
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1943
00:46:11.181 --> 00:46:11.321
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1944
00:46:11.321 --> 00:46:12.150
<v Speaker 1>I'm uh,</v>

1945
00:46:12.150 --> 00:46:12.630
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1946
00:46:12.630 --> 00:46:12.931
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1947
00:46:12.931 --> 00:46:16.860
<v Speaker 1>a soldier that lived in the 16 hundreds and I've been reincarnated and you know,</v>

1948
00:46:16.861 --> 00:46:20.490
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you about the boat that I was on that got sunk by the British troop.</v>

1949
00:46:20.660 --> 00:46:20.880
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1950
00:46:20.880 --> 00:46:21.121
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

1951
00:46:21.121 --> 00:46:22.410
<v Speaker 1>when people have those stories,</v>

1952
00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:26.310
<v Speaker 1>I really wonder whether or not sperm,</v>

1953
00:46:26.430 --> 00:46:27.690
<v Speaker 1>whether or not genetics,</v>

1954
00:46:27.691 --> 00:46:28.381
<v Speaker 1>whether or not you're,</v>

1955
00:46:28.381 --> 00:46:29.100
<v Speaker 1>you're a bar.</v>

1956
00:46:29.100 --> 00:46:29.781
<v Speaker 1>Like when,</v>

1957
00:46:29.781 --> 00:46:32.160
<v Speaker 1>when a person makes another person,</v>

1958
00:46:32.430 --> 00:46:35.280
<v Speaker 1>how much information is actually getting to that kid.</v>

1959
00:46:35.281 --> 00:46:38.760
<v Speaker 1>It might be like all a lot more than we have access to.</v>

1960
00:46:38.970 --> 00:46:43.970
<v Speaker 1>And it might very well be that when you are a person who has,</v>

1961
00:46:44.341 --> 00:46:44.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1962
00:46:44.520 --> 00:46:48.900
<v Speaker 1>who many macs of thousands of traceable generations,</v>

1963
00:46:49.110 --> 00:46:52.500
<v Speaker 1>that all of that information of all those people's lives might be somehow</v>

1964
00:46:52.510 --> 00:46:54.120
<v Speaker 1>another encoded in our DNA.</v>

1965
00:46:54.300 --> 00:46:56.070
<v Speaker 1>So in her past,</v>

1966
00:46:56.071 --> 00:46:57.060
<v Speaker 1>somewhere on the,</v>

1967
00:46:57.140 --> 00:46:58.770
<v Speaker 1>along that chain of life,</v>

1968
00:46:58.890 --> 00:47:03.270
<v Speaker 1>someone had a fucking horrific experience with a spider and maybe almost died</v>

1969
00:47:03.540 --> 00:47:04.201
<v Speaker 1>and shit.</v>

1970
00:47:04.201 --> 00:47:04.651
<v Speaker 1>Their pants,</v>

1971
00:47:04.651 --> 00:47:09.090
<v Speaker 1>every time they see spiders and some hundred that wacky gene think finds its way</v>

1972
00:47:09.091 --> 00:47:11.340
<v Speaker 1>into her little personality toolbox.</v>

1973
00:47:11.670 --> 00:47:14.250
<v Speaker 1>And now you say spider around her and her throat closes shut.</v>

1974
00:47:14.550 --> 00:47:16.590
<v Speaker 1>I mean this makes sense to me.</v>

1975
00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:19.580
<v Speaker 1>I mean obviously I know nothing about genetics.</v>

1976
00:47:21.110 --> 00:47:22.490
<v Speaker 6>Does that mean you can get raped and feel that?</v>

1977
00:47:22.970 --> 00:47:24.170
<v Speaker 6>But that will go away,</v>

1978
00:47:24.171 --> 00:47:24.930
<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>

1979
00:47:24.930 --> 00:47:25.150
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1980
00:47:25.150 --> 00:47:25.391
<v Speaker 1>Where,</v>

1981
00:47:25.391 --> 00:47:26.550
<v Speaker 1>where are the instincts come from?</v>

1982
00:47:26.551 --> 00:47:26.970
<v Speaker 1>Them.</v>

1983
00:47:26.970 --> 00:47:27.331
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

1984
00:47:27.331 --> 00:47:28.440
<v Speaker 1>Why do we have instincts?</v>

1985
00:47:28.441 --> 00:47:29.274
<v Speaker 1>Why do little,</v>

1986
00:47:29.640 --> 00:47:32.250
<v Speaker 1>why are they afraid of monsters if they live in cities?</v>

1987
00:47:32.490 --> 00:47:34.410
<v Speaker 1>Why is everybody afraid of things with big teeth?</v>

1988
00:47:34.411 --> 00:47:35.130
<v Speaker 1>It's in the dark.</v>

1989
00:47:35.130 --> 00:47:35.880
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you why.</v>

1990
00:47:35.880 --> 00:47:38.730
<v Speaker 1>Because at one point in time we used to be hunted by leopards.</v>

1991
00:47:38.910 --> 00:47:39.181
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1992
00:47:39.181 --> 00:47:40.760
<v Speaker 1>We would go out of our tents at night,</v>

1993
00:47:40.780 --> 00:47:41.940
<v Speaker 1>we'd get fucked up,</v>

1994
00:47:42.150 --> 00:47:42.361
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1995
00:47:42.361 --> 00:47:45.960
<v Speaker 1>cause we were a little monkey people and that shit is still in our head.</v>

1996
00:47:45.961 --> 00:47:48.270
<v Speaker 1>We're still terrified of monsters in the night.</v>

1997
00:47:48.510 --> 00:47:50.070
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's a genetic thing.</v>

1998
00:47:50.071 --> 00:47:54.750
<v Speaker 1>I think there's certain instincts that humans have that are relayed through</v>

1999
00:47:54.751 --> 00:47:57.630
<v Speaker 1>generation after generation of experience after experience.</v>

2000
00:47:57.810 --> 00:48:00.260
<v Speaker 1>It only makes sense that somehow or another that code,</v>

2001
00:48:00.320 --> 00:48:03.720
<v Speaker 1>these new DNA is different than personal experience.</v>

2002
00:48:04.010 --> 00:48:04.170
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2003
00:48:04.170 --> 00:48:06.000
<v Speaker 1>I think it's not because memes,</v>

2004
00:48:06.030 --> 00:48:08.730
<v Speaker 1>they know that racism can be transferred through genetics.</v>

2005
00:48:09.030 --> 00:48:09.450
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

2006
00:48:09.450 --> 00:48:13.950
<v Speaker 1>there's direct evidence that people who do not have exposure to racism,</v>

2007
00:48:14.130 --> 00:48:18.270
<v Speaker 1>but their parents were racist and they were adopted or more inclined to become</v>

2008
00:48:18.271 --> 00:48:20.040
<v Speaker 1>racist or have racist ideology,</v>

2009
00:48:20.260 --> 00:48:21.093
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera.</v>

2010
00:48:21.290 --> 00:48:22.890
<v Speaker 1>So not only did some,</v>

2011
00:48:22.910 --> 00:48:26.310
<v Speaker 1>some study on memes where they had a identical twins,</v>

2012
00:48:26.970 --> 00:48:28.850
<v Speaker 1>I watched some documentary on the,</v>

2013
00:48:28.851 --> 00:48:29.061
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2014
00:48:29.061 --> 00:48:32.130
<v Speaker 1>the concept of cultural genes basically.</v>

2015
00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:32.581
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>

2016
00:48:32.581 --> 00:48:34.500
<v Speaker 1>not just its ideas period.</v>

2017
00:48:34.680 --> 00:48:35.311
<v Speaker 1>And the,</v>

2018
00:48:35.311 --> 00:48:35.581
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2019
00:48:35.581 --> 00:48:35.761
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2020
00:48:35.761 --> 00:48:40.761
<v Speaker 1>the concept is that there's a certain amount of things that you learn in life</v>

2021
00:48:40.890 --> 00:48:42.270
<v Speaker 1>that's related to your children.</v>

2022
00:48:42.680 --> 00:48:46.050
<v Speaker 1>And that's one of the reasons why children of musical people become very</v>

2023
00:48:46.051 --> 00:48:46.681
<v Speaker 1>musical.</v>

2024
00:48:46.681 --> 00:48:47.011
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2025
00:48:47.011 --> 00:48:50.790
<v Speaker 1>it's very common that people have children and their children,</v>

2026
00:48:50.940 --> 00:48:52.920
<v Speaker 1>not just because it's the environment they grow up in,</v>

2027
00:48:52.921 --> 00:48:57.390
<v Speaker 1>but they show like an instant proclivity towards some sort of a thing that you</v>

2028
00:48:57.420 --> 00:49:01.200
<v Speaker 1>were very good at that wouldn't have to do with your physical genetics.</v>

2029
00:49:01.200 --> 00:49:03.020
<v Speaker 1>As we think of it as firms as you know,</v>

2030
00:49:03.030 --> 00:49:04.170
<v Speaker 1>body type and you know,</v>

2031
00:49:04.171 --> 00:49:05.760
<v Speaker 1>athleticism and things along those lines,</v>

2032
00:49:05.910 --> 00:49:08.550
<v Speaker 1>which we've already assumed transfer on and we know transfer on.</v>

2033
00:49:08.880 --> 00:49:09.713
<v Speaker 1>But I think there's,</v>

2034
00:49:10.080 --> 00:49:13.800
<v Speaker 1>there's also life experience and mental things that transfer on her.</v>

2035
00:49:14.270 --> 00:49:14.540
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2036
00:49:14.540 --> 00:49:17.280
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't mean that you're going to be racist because your dad was racist</v>

2037
00:49:17.281 --> 00:49:21.060
<v Speaker 1>because we know that's not the case with people that grew up with a racist dad.</v>

2038
00:49:21.330 --> 00:49:21.740
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2039
00:49:21.740 --> 00:49:26.740
<v Speaker 1>I have a friend whose dad was dad just can't not be racist no matter what it is</v>

2040
00:49:27.151 --> 00:49:27.781
<v Speaker 1>in the news.</v>

2041
00:49:27.781 --> 00:49:30.450
<v Speaker 1>It means like Archie bunker type dude.</v>

2042
00:49:30.510 --> 00:49:31.800
<v Speaker 1>You know what's kind of funny,</v>

2043
00:49:31.830 --> 00:49:33.750
<v Speaker 1>but he's just so racist.</v>

2044
00:49:33.930 --> 00:49:34.763
<v Speaker 1>My friend,</v>

2045
00:49:34.770 --> 00:49:36.120
<v Speaker 1>like as liberal as they come,</v>

2046
00:49:36.190 --> 00:49:40.410
<v Speaker 1>it just has no inclination towards any sort of judgment of anybody and it's</v>

2047
00:49:40.411 --> 00:49:44.430
<v Speaker 1>probably just his response to growing up with this idiot.</v>

2048
00:49:44.640 --> 00:49:44.821
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2049
00:49:44.821 --> 00:49:46.530
<v Speaker 1>these sort of figured out how dumb it is.</v>

2050
00:49:47.090 --> 00:49:47.370
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2051
00:49:47.370 --> 00:49:48.360
<v Speaker 1>he's rebounded from it,</v>

2052
00:49:48.361 --> 00:49:49.800
<v Speaker 1>which is pretty common with people.</v>

2053
00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:54.360
<v Speaker 1>But if he hadn't been around that guy and been in different environments,</v>

2054
00:49:54.361 --> 00:49:56.670
<v Speaker 1>I mean who knows how much of it is nature and nurture.</v>

2055
00:49:56.820 --> 00:50:01.740
<v Speaker 1>But the concept is that some of it is being transmitted through information,</v>

2056
00:50:03.390 --> 00:50:04.500
<v Speaker 1>through genetics.</v>

2057
00:50:04.680 --> 00:50:05.513
<v Speaker 1>I think it makes sense.</v>

2058
00:50:06.330 --> 00:50:10.410
<v Speaker 1>So this poor bitch some like somebody got checked by a spider and our past,</v>

2059
00:50:12.810 --> 00:50:14.970
<v Speaker 1>maybe I might be right.</v>

2060
00:50:15.250 --> 00:50:16.083
<v Speaker 1>It makes sense.</v>

2061
00:50:17.820 --> 00:50:18.653
<v Speaker 1>What's so funny?</v>

2062
00:50:18.930 --> 00:50:19.830
<v Speaker 7>So like her great,</v>

2063
00:50:19.831 --> 00:50:20.101
<v Speaker 7>great,</v>

2064
00:50:20.101 --> 00:50:21.120
<v Speaker 7>great grandmother was like,</v>

2065
00:50:21.760 --> 00:50:24.060
<v Speaker 7>Hi once in a little spider biters.</v>

2066
00:50:24.061 --> 00:50:24.241
<v Speaker 7>You're like,</v>

2067
00:50:24.241 --> 00:50:24.660
<v Speaker 7>oh,</v>

2068
00:50:24.660 --> 00:50:24.790
<v Speaker 7>oh</v>

2069
00:50:24.790 --> 00:50:29.390
<v Speaker 1>I know a girl who got bit by a fucking Brown Breck loose in her pussy.</v>

2070
00:50:29.510 --> 00:50:31.460
<v Speaker 1>Oh it was in her underwear.</v>

2071
00:50:31.461 --> 00:50:32.600
<v Speaker 1>She pulled her underwear.</v>

2072
00:50:32.630 --> 00:50:34.070
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know the spiders in there.</v>

2073
00:50:34.080 --> 00:50:35.210
<v Speaker 1>There's spider bit.</v>

2074
00:50:35.211 --> 00:50:40.211
<v Speaker 1>Her fucking pussy and a brown recluse is the most horrific spider in North</v>

2075
00:50:40.791 --> 00:50:41.330
<v Speaker 1>America.</v>

2076
00:50:41.330 --> 00:50:42.020
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

2077
00:50:42.020 --> 00:50:45.260
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't just doesn't poison you.</v>

2078
00:50:45.440 --> 00:50:48.770
<v Speaker 1>It literally turns your flesh dead flesh.</v>

2079
00:50:48.771 --> 00:50:49.604
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2080
00:50:49.760 --> 00:50:50.593
<v Speaker 1>What happened to her?</v>

2081
00:50:50.600 --> 00:50:50.880
<v Speaker 1>She,</v>

2082
00:50:50.880 --> 00:50:51.860
<v Speaker 1>her pussy died.</v>

2083
00:50:52.080 --> 00:50:52.840
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>

2084
00:50:52.840 --> 00:50:53.870
<v Speaker 1>can you imagine this?</v>

2085
00:50:53.871 --> 00:50:54.710
<v Speaker 1>You still have a pussy.</v>

2086
00:50:55.100 --> 00:50:55.933
<v Speaker 1>Is it just a whole,</v>

2087
00:50:56.060 --> 00:50:57.050
<v Speaker 1>it's dead.</v>

2088
00:50:57.080 --> 00:50:57.913
<v Speaker 1>It died.</v>

2089
00:50:59.740 --> 00:51:01.000
<v Speaker 1>Did a really I pussy.</v>

2090
00:51:01.730 --> 00:51:02.563
<v Speaker 1>That's tragic.</v>

2091
00:51:05.780 --> 00:51:07.760
<v Speaker 1>I don't know the extent of the damage,</v>

2092
00:51:07.761 --> 00:51:10.620
<v Speaker 1>but I have never seen a brown recluse bite that didn't do so.</v>

2093
00:51:12.350 --> 00:51:14.510
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how quickly she got to the doctor.</v>

2094
00:51:15.200 --> 00:51:19.100
<v Speaker 1>But essentially the toxins kills all the flesh around it to the point where you</v>

2095
00:51:19.101 --> 00:51:20.120
<v Speaker 1>have to carve it out.</v>

2096
00:51:20.320 --> 00:51:21.500
<v Speaker 1>It's like a big dead holds.</v>

2097
00:51:21.670 --> 00:51:22.380
<v Speaker 1>We discussed her.</v>

2098
00:51:22.380 --> 00:51:22.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2099
00:51:22.620 --> 00:51:23.960
<v Speaker 1>So she has a hole in her whole,</v>

2100
00:51:24.020 --> 00:51:24.620
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2101
00:51:24.620 --> 00:51:26.180
<v Speaker 1>it's probably don't even say it.</v>

2102
00:51:26.390 --> 00:51:27.770
<v Speaker 1>Don't say you son of a bitch.</v>

2103
00:51:28.820 --> 00:51:29.840
<v Speaker 1>They um,</v>

2104
00:51:30.290 --> 00:51:31.610
<v Speaker 1>they did do something.</v>

2105
00:51:31.660 --> 00:51:32.050
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2106
00:51:32.050 --> 00:51:32.491
<v Speaker 1>with the,</v>

2107
00:51:32.491 --> 00:51:32.661
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2108
00:51:32.661 --> 00:51:33.650
<v Speaker 1>Jeremy Horn,</v>

2109
00:51:33.830 --> 00:51:34.970
<v Speaker 1>one of the MMA fighters.</v>

2110
00:51:35.210 --> 00:51:35.781
<v Speaker 1>He had a,</v>

2111
00:51:35.781 --> 00:51:36.170
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2112
00:51:36.170 --> 00:51:40.130
<v Speaker 1>a brown recluse sting on his leg and he had like,</v>

2113
00:51:40.160 --> 00:51:43.160
<v Speaker 1>it was like a golf ball holes crazy.</v>

2114
00:51:43.400 --> 00:51:46.970
<v Speaker 1>He had like this giant hole that had just eaten through his leg and he had to</v>

2115
00:51:46.971 --> 00:51:50.510
<v Speaker 1>like keep gauze in it and everything that's happened to a lot of guys.</v>

2116
00:51:51.170 --> 00:51:53.750
<v Speaker 1>These fucking brown reckless is the climb in your shoes,</v>

2117
00:51:53.780 --> 00:51:54.081
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2118
00:51:54.081 --> 00:51:57.560
<v Speaker 1>and then you just put your shoe on and it'll sting you and your foot's jacked.</v>

2119
00:51:57.620 --> 00:51:59.690
<v Speaker 1>Their port of Scorpion out of my shoe and you send me,</v>

2120
00:51:59.860 --> 00:52:00.770
<v Speaker 1>did you boy,</v>

2121
00:52:01.550 --> 00:52:02.540
<v Speaker 1>he didn't know it was in there.</v>

2122
00:52:02.960 --> 00:52:03.380
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2123
00:52:03.380 --> 00:52:04.100
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2124
00:52:04.100 --> 00:52:04.281
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2125
00:52:04.281 --> 00:52:05.510
<v Speaker 1>you miss it before you put your shoe on.</v>

2126
00:52:07.160 --> 00:52:09.150
<v Speaker 1>I was going to put my shoe on and poured out of Scorpion.</v>

2127
00:52:09.151 --> 00:52:09.500
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

2128
00:52:09.500 --> 00:52:10.190
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

2129
00:52:10.190 --> 00:52:11.080
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2130
00:52:12.010 --> 00:52:12.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2131
00:52:12.400 --> 00:52:12.651
<v Speaker 1>How,</v>

2132
00:52:12.651 --> 00:52:14.060
<v Speaker 1>how poisonous or scorpions,</v>

2133
00:52:14.130 --> 00:52:17.060
<v Speaker 1>there's different models around rectories probably would have been fine.</v>

2134
00:52:17.120 --> 00:52:17.541
<v Speaker 1>Some of them,</v>

2135
00:52:17.541 --> 00:52:20.090
<v Speaker 1>some of them fuck you up and some of them just hurt real bad.</v>

2136
00:52:20.091 --> 00:52:20.331
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2137
00:52:20.331 --> 00:52:20.811
<v Speaker 1>Like a beast.</v>

2138
00:52:20.811 --> 00:52:22.820
<v Speaker 1>And I've heard the little ones are like real poisonous,</v>

2139
00:52:22.821 --> 00:52:23.780
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's just painful.</v>

2140
00:52:23.781 --> 00:52:24.800
<v Speaker 1>It's not like you're going to die.</v>

2141
00:52:25.580 --> 00:52:26.220
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2142
00:52:26.220 --> 00:52:26.870
<v Speaker 1>But we had,</v>

2143
00:52:26.870 --> 00:52:29.450
<v Speaker 1>we used them on fear factor of we use the big giant ones,</v>

2144
00:52:29.690 --> 00:52:30.740
<v Speaker 1>which are really not that bad,</v>

2145
00:52:30.860 --> 00:52:31.880
<v Speaker 1>which I think aren't as bad.</v>

2146
00:52:31.910 --> 00:52:32.211
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2147
00:52:32.211 --> 00:52:32.930
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of crazy.</v>

2148
00:52:32.930 --> 00:52:33.731
<v Speaker 1>But they fuck you up.</v>

2149
00:52:33.731 --> 00:52:34.564
<v Speaker 1>It's counterintuitive.</v>

2150
00:52:34.820 --> 00:52:35.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2151
00:52:35.150 --> 00:52:36.020
<v Speaker 1>They look horrific.</v>

2152
00:52:36.021 --> 00:52:37.980
<v Speaker 1>Those big black here,</v>

2153
00:52:38.210 --> 00:52:39.200
<v Speaker 1>it looks so evil,</v>

2154

00:56:08.981 --> 00:56:10.000
<v Speaker 5>And then he said that finally he,</v>

2299
00:56:10.001 --> 00:56:10.150
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2300
00:56:10.150 --> 00:56:12.880
<v Speaker 5>he cut himself his own little highlight reel type deal from stuff off the</v>

2301
00:56:12.881 --> 00:56:13.714
<v Speaker 5>Internet and whatever.</v>

2302
00:56:14.020 --> 00:56:14.441
<v Speaker 5>And um,</v>

2303
00:56:14.441 --> 00:56:15.880
<v Speaker 5>and then showed it to his boss is like,</v>

2304
00:56:15.910 --> 00:56:16.211
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

2305
00:56:16.211 --> 00:56:16.841
<v Speaker 5>it's this.</v>

2306
00:56:16.841 --> 00:56:17.350
<v Speaker 5>And they were like,</v>

2307
00:56:17.350 --> 00:56:17.711
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah,</v>

2308
00:56:17.711 --> 00:56:18.544
<v Speaker 5>let's do that.</v>

2309
00:56:18.690 --> 00:56:19.421
<v Speaker 5>Visually it's,</v>

2310
00:56:19.421 --> 00:56:20.650
<v Speaker 5>so that's the thing.</v>

2311
00:56:20.680 --> 00:56:21.460
<v Speaker 5>That's the thing.</v>

2312
00:56:21.460 --> 00:56:22.293
<v Speaker 5>But if you just,</v>

2313
00:56:22.420 --> 00:56:23.620
<v Speaker 5>if you just tell though,</v>

2314
00:56:23.680 --> 00:56:26.770
<v Speaker 5>there's this kid that basically homeless that rock climbs a lot,</v>

2315
00:56:27.040 --> 00:56:27.281
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2316
00:56:27.281 --> 00:56:27.611
<v Speaker 5>they're like,</v>

2317
00:56:27.611 --> 00:56:28.480
<v Speaker 5>that sounds stupid,</v>

2318
00:56:28.680 --> 00:56:28.900
<v Speaker 5>you know.</v>

2319
00:56:28.900 --> 00:56:30.130
<v Speaker 5>How did you feed yourself when,</v>

2320
00:56:30.131 --> 00:56:31.480
<v Speaker 5>before the 60 minutes thing?</v>

2321
00:56:31.540 --> 00:56:32.211
<v Speaker 5>Before you answer Paul.</v>

2322
00:56:32.211 --> 00:56:32.440
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2323
00:56:32.440 --> 00:56:33.880
<v Speaker 5>I had sponsored for 60 minutes.</v>

2324
00:56:34.100 --> 00:56:36.550
<v Speaker 5>It actually 60 minutes and even changed my whole sponsorship scene.</v>

2325
00:56:36.551 --> 00:56:37.840
<v Speaker 5>I already had all the climate stuff.</v>

2326
00:56:38.070 --> 00:56:38.331
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2327
00:56:38.331 --> 00:56:39.610
<v Speaker 5>Because you know,</v>

2328
00:56:39.611 --> 00:56:42.100
<v Speaker 5>the 60 minutes just catapulted me into like the mainstream.</v>

2329
00:56:42.101 --> 00:56:42.461
<v Speaker 5>But I mean,</v>

2330
00:56:42.461 --> 00:56:42.721
<v Speaker 5>I've,</v>

2331
00:56:42.721 --> 00:56:45.250
<v Speaker 5>I've been a pretty good climate for like years before that,</v>

2332
00:56:45.251 --> 00:56:45.610
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

2333
00:56:45.610 --> 00:56:48.340
<v Speaker 5>So how did people find out about you before they just,</v>

2334
00:56:48.370 --> 00:56:49.720
<v Speaker 5>you just start climbing,</v>

2335
00:56:49.721 --> 00:56:50.201
<v Speaker 5>word of mouth,</v>

2336
00:56:50.201 --> 00:56:50.561
<v Speaker 5>whatever,</v>

2337
00:56:50.561 --> 00:56:51.400
<v Speaker 5>like climbing magazines.</v>

2338
00:56:51.401 --> 00:56:52.390
<v Speaker 5>It's such a small community.</v>

2339
00:56:52.391 --> 00:56:52.481
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2340
00:56:52.481 --> 00:56:53.500
<v Speaker 5>it's a fairly small community.</v>

2341
00:56:53.820 --> 00:56:55.570
<v Speaker 5>What were you doing for a living back then?</v>

2342
00:56:56.260 --> 00:56:56.561
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2343
00:56:56.561 --> 00:56:58.000
<v Speaker 5>so for a couple of years,</v>

2344
00:56:58.010 --> 00:56:58.843
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2345
00:56:59.150 --> 00:57:02.290
<v Speaker 5>so I dropped out of college after one year I was going to UC Berkeley.</v>

2346
00:57:02.291 --> 00:57:03.124
<v Speaker 5>Do Engineering.</v>

2347
00:57:03.230 --> 00:57:04.570
<v Speaker 5>There's no climbing in this room.</v>

2348
00:57:04.800 --> 00:57:05.070
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2349
00:57:05.070 --> 00:57:05.850
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

2350
00:57:05.850 --> 00:57:06.121
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

2351
00:57:06.121 --> 00:57:06.954
<v Speaker 5>get me out of here.</v>

2352
00:57:06.980 --> 00:57:07.330
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

2353
00:57:07.330 --> 00:57:08.110
<v Speaker 5>this is kind of,</v>

2354
00:57:08.110 --> 00:57:10.320
<v Speaker 5>I wasn't super fired up on it for engineering would,</v>

2355
00:57:10.321 --> 00:57:10.911
<v Speaker 5>what was the,</v>

2356
00:57:10.911 --> 00:57:11.950
<v Speaker 5>the idea that was,</v>

2357
00:57:12.280 --> 00:57:12.541
<v Speaker 5>I don't know,</v>

2358
00:57:12.541 --> 00:57:13.600
<v Speaker 5>it was going to do civil engineering,</v>

2359
00:57:13.601 --> 00:57:15.130
<v Speaker 5>like build big structures or something.</v>

2360
00:57:15.130 --> 00:57:15.963
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

2361
00:57:15.970 --> 00:57:17.440
<v Speaker 5>I wasn't like super excited about it though.</v>

2362
00:57:17.920 --> 00:57:18.341
<v Speaker 5>And then,</v>

2363
00:57:18.341 --> 00:57:18.511
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2364
00:57:18.511 --> 00:57:21.430
<v Speaker 5>and then I kind of stopped and then I went climbing for a while and so for the,</v>

2365
00:57:21.580 --> 00:57:24.160
<v Speaker 5>like I spent a couple of years just kind of road trip and in climbing and then I</v>

2366
00:57:24.161 --> 00:57:26.200
<v Speaker 5>had sponsors and I did it more,</v>

2367
00:57:26.630 --> 00:57:26.920
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2368
00:57:26.920 --> 00:57:27.753
<v Speaker 5>becoming more and more.</v>

2369
00:57:27.760 --> 00:57:29.590
<v Speaker 5>When you first left college,</v>

2370
00:57:30.250 --> 00:57:30.941
<v Speaker 5>what did you do?</v>

2371
00:57:30.941 --> 00:57:33.760
<v Speaker 5>Did you get part time jobs and just climb everywhere?</v>

2372
00:57:33.880 --> 00:57:34.713
<v Speaker 5>Ads?</v>

2373
00:57:34.720 --> 00:57:34.991
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2374
00:57:34.991 --> 00:57:37.060
<v Speaker 5>so it's slightly more complicated,</v>

2375
00:57:37.061 --> 00:57:37.180
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>

2376
00:57:37.180 --> 00:57:37.361
<v Speaker 5>so,</v>

2377
00:57:37.361 --> 00:57:38.194
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2378
00:57:38.500 --> 00:57:42.280
<v Speaker 5>my dad died like the summer before I stopped going to college.</v>

2379
00:57:42.790 --> 00:57:43.061
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2380
00:57:43.061 --> 00:57:43.391
<v Speaker 5>actually,</v>

2381
00:57:43.391 --> 00:57:45.370
<v Speaker 5>so first off I got invited to youth,</v>

2382
00:57:45.371 --> 00:57:45.851
<v Speaker 5>nationals,</v>

2383
00:57:45.851 --> 00:57:46.180
<v Speaker 5>whatever.</v>

2384
00:57:46.180 --> 00:57:47.200
<v Speaker 5>So I'm like,</v>

2385
00:57:47.201 --> 00:57:47.500
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2386
00:57:47.500 --> 00:57:50.950
<v Speaker 5>like the Youth World Cup type thing because I did well at US nationals.</v>

2387
00:57:51.400 --> 00:57:51.761
<v Speaker 5>And so,</v>

2388
00:57:51.761 --> 00:57:52.300
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2389
00:57:52.300 --> 00:57:53.380
<v Speaker 5>it gave me an excuse to be like,</v>

2390
00:57:53.381 --> 00:57:55.630
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to take the next semester off and just like go to Europe,</v>

2391
00:57:55.631 --> 00:57:57.130
<v Speaker 5>do this youth camp and then,</v>

2392
00:57:57.131 --> 00:57:57.490
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2393
00:57:57.490 --> 00:57:59.020
<v Speaker 5>and then travel Europe and climate bit,</v>

2394
00:57:59.021 --> 00:57:59.470
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2395
00:57:59.470 --> 00:57:59.861
<v Speaker 5>so I was like,</v>

2396
00:57:59.861 --> 00:57:59.960
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

2397
00:57:59.960 --> 00:58:01.240
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to take next semester off.</v>

2398
00:58:01.750 --> 00:58:02.171
<v Speaker 5>And then,</v>

2399
00:58:02.171 --> 00:58:02.381
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2400
00:58:02.381 --> 00:58:03.760
<v Speaker 5>and then my dad died that summer.</v>

2401
00:58:04.240 --> 00:58:04.880
<v Speaker 5>And so,</v>

2402
00:58:04.880 --> 00:58:05.140
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2403
00:58:05.140 --> 00:58:07.720
<v Speaker 5>I was taking the semester off and then he left enough money for my sister and I</v>

2404
00:58:07.770 --> 00:58:08.321
<v Speaker 5>finished school,</v>

2405
00:58:08.321 --> 00:58:09.041
<v Speaker 5>like life insurance,</v>

2406
00:58:09.041 --> 00:58:09.251
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2407
00:58:09.251 --> 00:58:10.540
<v Speaker 5>for us both to finish college.</v>

2408
00:58:11.080 --> 00:58:11.291
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

2409
00:58:11.291 --> 00:58:12.124
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2410
00:58:12.160 --> 00:58:13.270
<v Speaker 5>and so I went to Europe,</v>

2411
00:58:13.330 --> 00:58:13.640
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2412
00:58:13.640 --> 00:58:14.361
<v Speaker 5>did this whole comp,</v>

2413
00:58:14.361 --> 00:58:15.101
<v Speaker 5>didn't do very well,</v>

2414
00:58:15.101 --> 00:58:15.461
<v Speaker 5>whatever,</v>

2415
00:58:15.461 --> 00:58:16.300
<v Speaker 5>but um,</v>

2416
00:58:16.630 --> 00:58:18.070
<v Speaker 5>and then just never went back to college.</v>

2417
00:58:18.071 --> 00:58:20.950
<v Speaker 5>And then you use the life insurance to like travel and climb for a couple of</v>

2418
00:58:20.950 --> 00:58:21.783
<v Speaker 5>years.</v>

2419
00:58:21.910 --> 00:58:22.743
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

2420
00:58:22.900 --> 00:58:23.733
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2421
00:58:23.950 --> 00:58:24.610
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

2422
00:58:24.610 --> 00:58:26.330
<v Speaker 5>So cool.</v>

2423
00:58:27.310 --> 00:58:28.960
<v Speaker 5>So when you first started doing that,</v>

2424
00:58:28.961 --> 00:58:31.990
<v Speaker 5>did you ever believe that you could get to a 0.1 day where you'd be a</v>

2425
00:58:31.991 --> 00:58:33.220
<v Speaker 5>professional he'd make,</v>

2426
00:58:33.370 --> 00:58:34.031
<v Speaker 5>I didn't even know.</v>

2427
00:58:34.031 --> 00:58:35.770
<v Speaker 5>I didn't even know there were professional climbers.</v>

2428
00:58:35.800 --> 00:58:36.071
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2429
00:58:36.071 --> 00:58:36.904
<v Speaker 5>it'd be like,</v>

2430
00:58:37.120 --> 00:58:38.500
<v Speaker 5>it's such a niche little thing.</v>

2431
00:58:38.560 --> 00:58:41.500
<v Speaker 5>I mean all I knew is that I loved going climbing and that there wasn't anything</v>

2432
00:58:41.501 --> 00:58:45.130
<v Speaker 5>else that I'd rather be doing and that I wasn't super fired up on school.</v>

2433
00:58:45.130 --> 00:58:46.390
<v Speaker 5>And so I was just like,</v>

2434
00:58:46.391 --> 00:58:47.710
<v Speaker 5>well I'm just going to go on a road trip.</v>

2435
00:58:47.890 --> 00:58:49.870
<v Speaker 5>The road trip is kind of like a classic climbing thing.</v>

2436
00:58:49.871 --> 00:58:53.500
<v Speaker 5>Everybody goes on the road trip and just travels and climbs and follows the good</v>

2437
00:58:53.501 --> 00:58:53.980
<v Speaker 5>weather.</v>

2438
00:58:53.980 --> 00:58:55.300
<v Speaker 5>And so I just did that for a few years.</v>

2439
00:58:55.301 --> 00:58:58.600
<v Speaker 5>And then that's just like a climber community thing.</v>

2440
00:58:58.720 --> 00:58:59.200
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2441
00:58:59.200 --> 00:58:59.471
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2442
00:58:59.471 --> 00:59:01.660
<v Speaker 5>A lot of like most climbers do that basically.</v>

2443
00:59:03.030 --> 00:59:03.880
<v Speaker 5>Cause you kind of have to,</v>

2444
00:59:03.881 --> 00:59:04.714
<v Speaker 5>because you have to,</v>

2445
00:59:04.930 --> 00:59:07.300
<v Speaker 5>you have to be at the different rocks in different places,</v>

2446
00:59:07.301 --> 00:59:07.901
<v Speaker 5>in good weather.</v>

2447
00:59:07.901 --> 00:59:08.261
<v Speaker 5>So I mean,</v>

2448
00:59:08.261 --> 00:59:09.220
<v Speaker 5>you have to constantly move,</v>

2449
00:59:10.460 --> 00:59:11.440
<v Speaker 5>but wow.</v>

2450
00:59:11.470 --> 00:59:12.820
<v Speaker 5>So while you're doing this,</v>

2451
00:59:12.970 --> 00:59:13.630
<v Speaker 5>you just thinking,</v>

00:59:34.971 --> 00:59:35.300
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2479
00:59:35.300 --> 00:59:37.100
<v Speaker 5>so I picked up a little sponsors like that where I was like,</v>

2492
00:59:44.960 --> 00:59:46.280
<v Speaker 5>Like my first,</v>

2493
00:59:46.310 --> 00:59:46.911
<v Speaker 5>my first,</v>

2494
00:59:46.911 --> 00:59:47.450
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2495
00:59:47.450 --> 00:59:50.930
<v Speaker 5>my rope sponsor was the first people to pay me and they were paying me 100 bucks</v>

2496
00:59:50.931 --> 00:59:51.651
<v Speaker 5>a month and I was like,</v>

2497
00:59:51.651 --> 00:59:52.161
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

2498
00:59:52.161 --> 00:59:53.480
<v Speaker 5>I'm making 100 bucks a month.</v>

2499
00:59:54.040 --> 00:59:57.520
<v Speaker 5>Rope sponsor one of those ropes might've,</v>

2500
00:59:58.090 --> 00:59:58.560
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2501
00:59:58.560 --> 00:59:59.181
<v Speaker 5>like nylon,</v>

2502
00:59:59.181 --> 01:00:00.170
<v Speaker 5>same as every other.</v>

2503
01:00:00.230 --> 01:00:01.550
<v Speaker 5>Does anybody make a hemp one?</v>

2504
01:00:01.970 --> 01:00:02.221
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

2505
01:00:02.221 --> 01:00:03.170
<v Speaker 5>that's like the old school.</v>

2506
01:00:03.171 --> 01:00:04.004
<v Speaker 5>It's been replaced.</v>

2507
01:00:04.100 --> 01:00:05.000
<v Speaker 5>Is the nylon better?</v>

2508
01:00:05.060 --> 01:00:05.241
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2509
01:00:05.241 --> 01:00:06.074
<v Speaker 5>the nylon is way better.</v>

2510
01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:07.080
<v Speaker 5>What is a z?</v>

2511
01:00:07.180 --> 01:00:08.220
<v Speaker 5>You can get tighter.</v>

2512
01:00:08.250 --> 01:00:09.140
<v Speaker 5>It can get stronger.</v>

2513
01:00:09.141 --> 01:00:09.601
<v Speaker 5>Is that what it is?</v>

2514
01:00:09.601 --> 01:00:10.790
<v Speaker 5>That's probably durability I think.</v>

2515
01:00:10.791 --> 01:00:12.410
<v Speaker 5>And I think part of its elasticity,</v>

2516
01:00:12.411 --> 01:00:13.980
<v Speaker 5>I think hemp like stretches more and,</v>

2517
01:00:14.030 --> 01:00:15.890
<v Speaker 5>and breaks easier and whatever.</v>

2518
01:00:16.010 --> 01:00:16.341
<v Speaker 5>Not on,</v>

2519
01:00:16.341 --> 01:00:17.030
<v Speaker 5>it's just better.</v>

2520
01:00:17.030 --> 01:00:17.391
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2521
01:00:17.391 --> 01:00:18.830
<v Speaker 5>There's no like a dude,</v>

2522
01:00:18.831 --> 01:00:21.770
<v Speaker 5>just try to keep it real and go climbing with hemp rope and everybody else like,</v>

2523
01:00:21.771 --> 01:00:22.011
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>

2524
01:00:22.011 --> 01:00:22.940
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck for sure.</v>

2525
01:00:22.941 --> 01:00:23.571
<v Speaker 5>With the ropes,</v>

2526
01:00:23.571 --> 01:00:24.141
<v Speaker 5>nobody's like,</v>

2527
01:00:24.141 --> 01:00:25.130
<v Speaker 5>I want to go old school.</v>

2528
01:00:25.131 --> 01:00:26.890
<v Speaker 5>I want to use the oldest route possible.</v>

2529
01:00:26.950 --> 01:00:28.370

2530
01:00:28.480 --> 01:00:29.270
<v Speaker 5>No impact.</v>

2531
01:00:29.270 --> 01:00:30.590
<v Speaker 5>Like a weird sort of,</v>

2532
01:00:30.591 --> 01:00:30.950

2588
01:02:00.720 --> 01:02:01.471
<v Speaker 3>laptop bags,</v>

2589
01:02:01.471 --> 01:02:03.180
<v Speaker 3>but back all of its high quality hemp,</v>

2590
01:02:03.390 --> 01:02:04.680
<v Speaker 3>Colorado recently,</v>

2591
01:02:04.710 --> 01:02:05.100
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2592
01:02:05.100 --> 01:02:05.910
<v Speaker 3>as,</v>

2593
01:02:05.910 --> 01:02:06.750
<v Speaker 3>as far as,</v>

2594
01:02:06.800 --> 01:02:07.440
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2595
01:02:07.440 --> 01:02:10.890
<v Speaker 3>the new thing that's been passed that makes marijuana legal,</v>

2596
01:02:11.280 --> 01:02:13.290
<v Speaker 3>it also makes growing hemp legal.</v>

2597
01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:17.010
<v Speaker 3>And the first guy is stepping up to start a hemp farm.</v>

2598
01:02:17.250 --> 01:02:18.160
<v Speaker 3>So awesome.</v>

2599
01:02:18.970 --> 01:02:20.290
<v Speaker 3>We have to start a Kickstarter</v>

2600
01:02:20.290 --> 01:02:23.270
<v Speaker 1>for his legal fund from the DEA comes and locks them up and some,</v>

2601
01:02:23.590 --> 01:02:24.091
<v Speaker 1>because of the,</v>

2602
01:02:24.091 --> 01:02:27.310
<v Speaker 1>like the National Defense Authorization Act and the Patriot Act,</v>

2603
01:02:27.311 --> 01:02:30.670
<v Speaker 1>that guy becomes a terrorist and they lock him in some fucking sell in</v>

2604
01:02:30.671 --> 01:02:31.510
<v Speaker 1>Guantanamo Bay.</v>

2605
01:02:31.511 --> 01:02:32.500
<v Speaker 1>And that's not a joke,</v>

2606
01:02:32.501 --> 01:02:33.180
<v Speaker 1>folks.</v>

2607
01:02:33.180 --> 01:02:33.481
<v Speaker 1>Have you,</v>

2608
01:02:33.481 --> 01:02:35.320
<v Speaker 1>if you're selling drugs in any way,</v>

2609
01:02:35.321 --> 01:02:36.100
<v Speaker 1>shape or form,</v>

2610
01:02:36.100 --> 01:02:37.330
<v Speaker 1>you're like a terrorist now.</v>

2611
01:02:37.630 --> 01:02:39.310
<v Speaker 1>And if you're selling hemp,</v>

2612
01:02:39.370 --> 01:02:42.580
<v Speaker 1>even though it's not even psychoactive and not the psychoactive form of</v>

2613
01:02:42.581 --> 01:02:43.330
<v Speaker 1>marijuana,</v>

2614
01:02:43.330 --> 01:02:47.350
<v Speaker 1>it's still federally illegal and they would treat you the same way.</v>

2615
01:02:47.351 --> 01:02:48.900
<v Speaker 1>They would treat someone who was growing heroin.</v>

2616
01:02:49.850 --> 01:02:51.850
<v Speaker 1>It's so stupid.</v>

2617
01:02:51.851 --> 01:02:56.200
<v Speaker 1>It's so fucking stupid because what what people don't understand is we sell hemp</v>

2618
01:02:56.860 --> 01:02:57.520
<v Speaker 1>at on it.</v>

2619
01:02:57.520 --> 01:02:58.720
<v Speaker 1>We have hemp protein.</v>

2620
01:02:58.750 --> 01:02:59.680
<v Speaker 1>It's delicious.</v>

2621
01:02:59.681 --> 01:03:00.401
<v Speaker 1>It's nutritious.</v>

2622
01:03:00.401 --> 01:03:03.820
<v Speaker 1>It's you don't test positive for THC because there's not any in it.</v>

2623
01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.700
<v Speaker 1>You get this stuff from the male plant,</v>

2624
01:03:06.701 --> 01:03:07.461
<v Speaker 1>the hemp plant,</v>

2625
01:03:07.461 --> 01:03:08.320
<v Speaker 1>the cannabis plant.</v>

2626
01:03:08.500 --> 01:03:10.270
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't have any psychoactive capability.</v>

2627
01:03:10.271 --> 01:03:12.370
<v Speaker 1>You would have to get like a whole forest of it to get high,</v>

2628
01:03:12.790 --> 01:03:13.623
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

2629
01:03:13.630 --> 01:03:17.650
<v Speaker 1>but it is very nutritious and it is very illegal.</v>

2630
01:03:18.100 --> 01:03:19.450
<v Speaker 1>We have to buy from Canada,</v>

2631
01:03:19.630 --> 01:03:21.100
<v Speaker 1>so we're allowed to have it,</v>

2632
01:03:21.280 --> 01:03:22.300
<v Speaker 1>but we can't grow it.</v>

2633
01:03:22.540 --> 01:03:24.250
<v Speaker 1>It's the dumbest thing in the world,</v>

2634
01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:25.720
<v Speaker 1>so they buy it.</v>

2635
01:03:26.170 --> 01:03:27.040
<v Speaker 1>We have to,</v>

2636
01:03:27.070 --> 01:03:28.510
<v Speaker 1>the Canadians have to grow it.</v>

2637
01:03:28.810 --> 01:03:30.940
<v Speaker 1>We get it from them and then we sell it,</v>

2638
01:03:31.240 --> 01:03:32.350
<v Speaker 1>but if we grow it,</v>

2639
01:03:32.410 --> 01:03:34.660
<v Speaker 1>they'll lock us in jail for a hundred years.</v>

2640
01:03:34.930 --> 01:03:37.510
<v Speaker 1>If you grow the plants that you,</v>

2641
01:03:37.540 --> 01:03:41.410
<v Speaker 1>you need to make hemp protein powder or hemp oil or any of that shit,</v>

2642
01:03:41.411 --> 01:03:44.260
<v Speaker 1>they'll just lock you in jail for federal crimes.</v>

2643
01:03:45.040 --> 01:03:45.873
<v Speaker 1>It's insane.</v>

2644
01:03:46.240 --> 01:03:48.970
<v Speaker 1>It's unbelievable how dumb the the world is.</v>

2645
01:03:49.030 --> 01:03:49.421
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

2646
01:03:49.421 --> 01:03:49.931
<v Speaker 1>it's really,</v>

2647
01:03:49.931 --> 01:03:54.931
<v Speaker 1>it hurts my brain sometimes that it's 2013 and that with the it access to</v>

2648
01:03:55.481 --> 01:03:59.830
<v Speaker 1>information that we have the world and the government still hasn't caught up.</v>

2649
01:03:59.890 --> 01:04:04.890
<v Speaker 1>The people in positions of power are still operating like it's the 1950s in the</v>

2650
01:04:05.650 --> 01:04:07.510
<v Speaker 1>1960s and everybody's fucking stupid.</v>

2651
01:04:08.080 --> 01:04:08.611
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>

2652
01:04:08.611 --> 01:04:09.730
<v Speaker 1>it's really amazing.</v>

2653
01:04:10.240 --> 01:04:11.890
<v Speaker 1>It's drives me crazy.</v>

2654
01:04:12.490 --> 01:04:15.220
<v Speaker 1>How many people get high and climb most?</v>

2655
01:04:15.610 --> 01:04:16.270
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

2656
01:04:16.270 --> 01:04:17.081
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to do it though,</v>

2657
01:04:17.081 --> 01:04:17.914
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

2658
01:04:18.130 --> 01:04:18.941
<v Speaker 1>I would think that,</v>

2659
01:04:18.941 --> 01:04:19.390
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2660
01:04:19.390 --> 01:04:20.081
<v Speaker 1>maybe not most,</v>

2661
01:04:20.081 --> 01:04:21.520
<v Speaker 1>but a lot say a lot.</v>

2662
01:04:21.820 --> 01:04:22.830
<v Speaker 5>I wouldn't do it.</v>

2663
01:04:23.410 --> 01:04:23.670
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2664
01:04:23.670 --> 01:04:25.620
<v Speaker 5>There's a last place you want to be paranoid</v>

2665
01:04:27.240 --> 01:04:28.073
<v Speaker 5>lunches.</v>

2666
01:04:28.160 --> 01:04:28.993
<v Speaker 5>Jesus.</v>

2667
01:04:29.010 --> 01:04:29.320
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2668
01:04:29.320 --> 01:04:29.580
<v Speaker 5>Warm.</v>

2669
01:04:29.580 --> 01:04:30.480
<v Speaker 5>You have the Munchies,</v>

2670
01:04:30.481 --> 01:04:32.820
<v Speaker 5>you got five hours to go to get to the top point.</v>

2671
01:04:32.821 --> 01:04:34.110
<v Speaker 5>You need a quail egg.</v>

2672
01:04:35.720 --> 01:04:38.340
<v Speaker 5>There's some specific nests that you'd go to.</v>

2673
01:04:38.341 --> 01:04:39.210
<v Speaker 5>It's been mapped out.</v>

2674
01:04:39.690 --> 01:04:41.100
<v Speaker 5>Hikers Digest,</v>

2675
01:04:41.670 --> 01:04:44.670
<v Speaker 5>however 60 go up there and eat that fucking port birds,</v>

2676
01:04:44.671 --> 01:04:45.070
<v Speaker 5>eggs.</v>

2677
01:04:45.070 --> 01:04:48.690
<v Speaker 5>Try to get enough energy to make it to the top so you can stay alive.</v>

2678
01:04:48.720 --> 01:04:48.991
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2679
01:04:48.991 --> 01:04:49.970
<v Speaker 5>You don't want to get the munchies</v>

2680
01:04:50.060 --> 01:04:51.020
<v Speaker 1>or climbing a mountain.</v>

2681
01:04:52.330 --> 01:04:54.960
<v Speaker 5>Do you have a poop bag and stuff when you go up there or do you just check for</v>

2682
01:04:54.961 --> 01:04:56.650
<v Speaker 5>you if you're growing up for like a week or some of them?</v>

2683
01:04:56.660 --> 01:04:57.420
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2684
01:04:57.420 --> 01:04:58.570
<v Speaker 5>I mean if you're doing day missions,</v>

2685
01:04:59.010 --> 01:05:00.490
<v Speaker 5>how are we in the middle of a climb?</v>

2686
01:05:00.491 --> 01:05:01.324
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2687
01:05:02.560 --> 01:05:03.341
<v Speaker 5>it happens.</v>

2688
01:05:03.341 --> 01:05:04.290
<v Speaker 5>You just let it go.</v>

2689
01:05:06.300 --> 01:05:07.133
<v Speaker 5>What do you think you do</v>

2690
01:05:08.610 --> 01:05:08.880
<v Speaker 5>it?</v>

2691
01:05:08.880 --> 01:05:12.200
<v Speaker 5>Just take a break to take your pants off later.</v>

2692
01:05:12.240 --> 01:05:15.140
<v Speaker 5>I know for sure you take your pants off and you do while you're climbing with</v>

2693
01:05:15.141 --> 01:05:15.370
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

2694
01:05:15.370 --> 01:05:16.960
<v Speaker 5>there was a little ledges and little stances,</v>

2695
01:05:17.110 --> 01:05:18.290
<v Speaker 5>like something you can share.</v>

2696
01:05:18.291 --> 01:05:20.460
<v Speaker 5>You get there and you just go buck wild the rest of the way.</v>

2697
01:05:20.480 --> 01:05:21.910
<v Speaker 5>Just do whatever you go naked.</v>

2698
01:05:22.130 --> 01:05:22.271
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2699
01:05:22.271 --> 01:05:22.360
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

2700
01:05:22.360 --> 01:05:22.451
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

2701
01:05:22.451 --> 01:05:24.130
<v Speaker 5>You just shake the shit out,</v>

2702
01:05:24.131 --> 01:05:24.520
<v Speaker 5>put it back.</v>

2703
01:05:24.520 --> 01:05:25.780
<v Speaker 5>You don't poop your pants.</v>

2704
01:05:25.781 --> 01:05:25.991
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2705
01:05:25.991 --> 01:05:26.824
<v Speaker 5>you put it down,</v>

2706
01:05:26.850 --> 01:05:28.440
<v Speaker 5>you take a poop and then the best,</v>

2707
01:05:28.450 --> 01:05:31.360
<v Speaker 5>the best is to shit put where you poop onto a rock and then you hurl the rock</v>

2708
01:05:31.361 --> 01:05:32.194
<v Speaker 5>off into the abyss.</v>

2709
01:05:33.340 --> 01:05:34.173
<v Speaker 5>Shit pudding.</v>

2710
01:05:35.190 --> 01:05:35.531
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

2711
01:05:35.531 --> 01:05:36.490
<v Speaker 5>it's pretty legit.</v>

2712
01:05:36.580 --> 01:05:36.881
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

2713
01:05:36.881 --> 01:05:38.050
<v Speaker 5>so you've never been climbing,</v>

2714
01:05:38.051 --> 01:05:39.040
<v Speaker 5>you just shit your pants.</v>

2715
01:05:39.120 --> 01:05:39.810
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2716
01:05:39.810 --> 01:05:42.950
<v Speaker 5>that's what I thought you meant when you said your shit all over the place.</v>

2717
01:05:43.190 --> 01:05:44.870
<v Speaker 5>I need just let him know.</v>

2718
01:05:44.871 --> 01:05:47.440
<v Speaker 5>The worst case scenarios is that you have a robot bonding.</v>

2719
01:05:47.460 --> 01:05:48.710
<v Speaker 5>You have to poop immediately.</v>

2720
01:05:48.711 --> 01:05:50.240
<v Speaker 5>And so you just like swing to the side.</v>

2721
01:05:50.241 --> 01:05:52.290
<v Speaker 5>You pull your harness and pants as far as you can't eat,</v>

2722
01:05:52.310 --> 01:05:53.360
<v Speaker 5>just poop all over the wall.</v>

2723
01:05:53.630 --> 01:05:54.760
<v Speaker 5>That's like the worst case scenario.</v>

2724
01:05:54.770 --> 01:05:55.070
<v Speaker 5>You really,</v>

2725
01:05:55.070 --> 01:05:55.903
<v Speaker 5>wow.</v>

2726
01:05:56.510 --> 01:05:59.810
<v Speaker 5>We need to make videos of this video.</v>

2727
01:06:00.230 --> 01:06:03.050
<v Speaker 5>There's an amazing climbing video of a dude actually pooping his pants.</v>

01:06:25.641 --> 01:06:26.061
<v Speaker 5>A little bit.</v>

2743
01:06:26.061 --> 01:06:26.511
<v Speaker 5>I actually,</v>

2744
01:06:26.511 --> 01:06:28.610
<v Speaker 5>I've been vegetarian for like a month and a little bit.</v>

01:06:35.690 --> 01:06:36.171
<v Speaker 5>It's actually,</v>

2757
01:06:36.171 --> 01:06:37.640
<v Speaker 5>it's one of my favorite car videos.</v>

2758
01:06:39.090 --> 01:06:39.923
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2759
01:06:40.090 --> 01:06:40.751
<v Speaker 5>And is this,</v>

2760
01:06:40.751 --> 01:06:41.584
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2761
01:06:43.800 --> 01:06:44.760
<v Speaker 4>requires a rescue?</v>

2762
01:06:45.210 --> 01:06:45.850
<v Speaker 5>Let's see.</v>

2763
01:06:45.850 --> 01:06:47.520
<v Speaker 5>So you see free soloing this?</v>

<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

2765
01:06:47.910 --> 01:06:49.080

2766
01:06:49.081 --> 01:06:52.020

2767
01:06:52.140 --> 01:06:54.690
<v Speaker 5>like it's too big for him to put his hands in fists into or whatever.</v>

2768
01:06:54.691 --> 01:06:57.480
<v Speaker 5>So he has to wedge his leg in and so he gets his leg stuck,</v>

2769
01:06:57.760 --> 01:06:58.441
<v Speaker 5>like stuck,</v>

2784
01:07:22.250 --> 01:07:24.110

01:07:34.790 --> 01:07:35.431

2806
01:08:00.291 --> 01:08:01.220

<v Speaker 5>He's stuck and shits his pants puke.</v>

2808
01:08:04.550 --> 01:08:08.200
<v Speaker 5>And the guy below him is like just down when the relaxed,</v>

2809
01:08:08.730 --> 01:08:09.890
<v Speaker 5>one of my really good friends,</v>

2810
01:08:10.160 --> 01:08:11.690
<v Speaker 5>he's just try to help them out.</v>

2811
01:08:11.691 --> 01:08:12.400
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2812
01:08:12.400 --> 01:08:13.233
<v Speaker 5>it's pretty butted.</v>

2813
01:08:13.340 --> 01:08:13.850
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

2814
01:08:13.850 --> 01:08:14.810
<v Speaker 5>They're both are good friends.</v>

2815
01:08:15.260 --> 01:08:16.880
<v Speaker 5>Now when you do this climbing,</v>

2816
01:08:16.881 --> 01:08:18.290
<v Speaker 5>I'm ignorant to this as well.</v>

2817
01:08:18.410 --> 01:08:18.860
<v Speaker 5>When you,</v>

2818
01:08:18.860 --> 01:08:21.080
<v Speaker 5>when you climb up the mountain and you're using ropes,</v>

2819
01:08:21.470 --> 01:08:21.800
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2820
01:08:21.800 --> 01:08:22.610
<v Speaker 5>how do you do it?</v>

2821
01:08:22.610 --> 01:08:23.690
<v Speaker 5>What do you start out?</v>

2822
01:08:23.720 --> 01:08:27.290
<v Speaker 5>Do you like knock something in as soon as you climbed a certain part,</v>

2823
01:08:27.410 --> 01:08:31.410
<v Speaker 5>knock something in that secure and then connect your rope to it and then keep,</v>

2824
01:08:31.970 --> 01:08:33.290
<v Speaker 5>keep unconnecting it.</v>

2825
01:08:33.291 --> 01:08:33.950
<v Speaker 5>Do you recap?</v>

2826
01:08:33.950 --> 01:08:36.380
<v Speaker 5>You said generally you started the ground with um,</v>

2827
01:08:36.590 --> 01:08:37.670
<v Speaker 5>what's called a rack of gear,</v>

2828
01:08:37.671 --> 01:08:40.400
<v Speaker 5>like an assortment of gear that you have little things that you can put into</v>

2829
01:08:40.401 --> 01:08:41.234
<v Speaker 5>cracks or like,</v>

2830
01:08:41.480 --> 01:08:42.140
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2831
01:08:42.140 --> 01:08:42.471
<v Speaker 5>whatever,</v>

2832
01:08:42.471 --> 01:08:44.480
<v Speaker 5>put into cracks journey and uh,</v>

2833
01:08:44.481 --> 01:08:46.430
<v Speaker 5>and so you climb up and you put them in as you go,</v>

2834
01:08:46.431 --> 01:08:47.420
<v Speaker 5>you clip your rope into him.</v>

2835
01:08:47.690 --> 01:08:48.890
<v Speaker 5>So at any time if you fall,</v>

2836
01:08:48.891 --> 01:08:49.491
<v Speaker 5>you just fall,</v>

2837
01:08:49.491 --> 01:08:50.020
<v Speaker 5>doubled it.</v>

2838
01:08:50.020 --> 01:08:51.230
<v Speaker 5>And to the last piece of gear,</v>

2839
01:08:51.710 --> 01:08:51.981
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2840
01:08:51.981 --> 01:08:54.380
<v Speaker 5>because you climb like say five feet above the last piece of gear.</v>

2841
01:08:54.550 --> 01:08:55.191
<v Speaker 5>So if you fall,</v>

2842
01:08:55.191 --> 01:08:57.620
<v Speaker 5>you fall that five feet plus the five feet of slack that you had to.</v>

2843
01:08:58.040 --> 01:09:00.920
<v Speaker 5>So how does it relax or how does the,</v>

2844
01:09:00.980 --> 01:09:02.950
<v Speaker 5>how does the robe disconnect from the one,</v>

2845
01:09:03.170 --> 01:09:05.120
<v Speaker 5>the second person has to climb up it after you.</v>

2846
01:09:05.510 --> 01:09:07.700
<v Speaker 5>So if you're climbing like a thousand foot wall,</v>

2847
01:09:07.820 --> 01:09:09.720
<v Speaker 5>then the first person climbs,</v>

2848
01:09:09.800 --> 01:09:10.170
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2849
01:09:10.170 --> 01:09:11.390
<v Speaker 5>say a hundred feet and stops.</v>

2850
01:09:11.570 --> 01:09:14.000
<v Speaker 5>And then brings up the second person and then the,</v>

2851
01:09:14.210 --> 01:09:16.040
<v Speaker 5>then they do it again over and over the whole way.</v>

2852
01:09:16.370 --> 01:09:18.140
<v Speaker 5>It's called pitches or like rope lengths.</v>

2853
01:09:18.650 --> 01:09:21.230
<v Speaker 5>So you climb like one rope length and then you do the next one and then you do</v>

2854
01:09:21.231 --> 01:09:22.040
<v Speaker 5>the next one.</v>

2855
01:09:22.040 --> 01:09:27.040
<v Speaker 5>Is the technology for these pieces of equipment so good that nothing ever fails?</v>

2856
01:09:28.100 --> 01:09:29.120
<v Speaker 5>I mean for the most part,</v>

2857
01:09:29.121 --> 01:09:30.620
<v Speaker 5>I mean like everything breaks,</v>

2858
01:09:30.621 --> 01:09:31.070
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2859
01:09:31.070 --> 01:09:33.560
<v Speaker 5>like everything in life will break in the right circumstances.</v>

2860
01:09:33.560 --> 01:09:34.160
<v Speaker 5>But um,</v>

2861
01:09:34.160 --> 01:09:36.200
<v Speaker 5>but climbing year is really well made,</v>

2862
01:09:36.201 --> 01:09:38.180
<v Speaker 5>well manufactured and like pretty well tested.</v>

2863
01:09:38.660 --> 01:09:38.901
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

2864
01:09:38.901 --> 01:09:39.734
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2865
01:09:39.770 --> 01:09:39.951
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2866
01:09:39.951 --> 01:09:40.131
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

2867
01:09:40.131 --> 01:09:43.400
<v Speaker 5>there are circumstances where you can like trust your life to like a piece of</v>

2868
01:09:43.401 --> 01:09:46.430
<v Speaker 5>gear and like one little widget that you put into a crack and you're like,</v>

2869
01:09:46.431 --> 01:09:47.060
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

2870
01:09:47.060 --> 01:09:47.271
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2871
01:09:47.271 --> 01:09:48.470
<v Speaker 5>but generally you back things up,</v>

2872
01:09:48.471 --> 01:09:49.880
<v Speaker 5>you have it all tripled or whatever.</v>

2873
01:09:50.060 --> 01:09:50.893
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

2874
01:09:51.450 --> 01:09:53.420
<v Speaker 5>and these things that you put into cracks,</v>

2875
01:09:53.421 --> 01:09:55.700
<v Speaker 5>they separate or something like it.</v>

2876
01:09:56.020 --> 01:09:57.770
<v Speaker 5>Now they call it cams there caming devices.</v>

2877
01:09:57.771 --> 01:09:59.990
<v Speaker 5>So the two lobes sort of like an umbrella or something.</v>

2878
01:10:00.260 --> 01:10:03.290
<v Speaker 5>So you pull a trigger and they can contract and then you put it into the crack</v>

2879
01:10:03.350 --> 01:10:05.750
<v Speaker 5>and then they expand outward and then when you pull on them,</v>

2880
01:10:05.780 --> 01:10:07.340
<v Speaker 5>they expand outward even further.</v>

2881
01:10:07.460 --> 01:10:08.960
<v Speaker 5>And so they went to themselves into the crack.</v>

2882
01:10:09.190 --> 01:10:10.000
<v Speaker 5>Ah.</v>

2883
01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:10.281
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2884
01:10:10.281 --> 01:10:10.610
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

2885
01:10:10.610 --> 01:10:10.911
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2886
01:10:10.911 --> 01:10:12.050
<v Speaker 5>it's just a simple camming thing.</v>

2887
01:10:12.050 --> 01:10:15.590
<v Speaker 5>So it's just the pressure of that pushing just much like that guy was climbing</v>

2888
01:10:15.591 --> 01:10:15.760
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>

2889
01:10:15.760 --> 01:10:15.980
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2890
01:10:15.980 --> 01:10:16.371
<v Speaker 5>exactly.</v>

2891
01:10:16.371 --> 01:10:16.791
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>

2892
01:10:16.791 --> 01:10:17.624
<v Speaker 5>It's counter pressure.</v>

2893
01:10:18.680 --> 01:10:20.420
<v Speaker 5>And how was it designed?</v>

2894
01:10:20.421 --> 01:10:21.590
<v Speaker 5>Like what does it made out of?</v>

2895
01:10:21.700 --> 01:10:23.060
<v Speaker 5>Like aluminum I think,</v>

2896
01:10:23.540 --> 01:10:24.373
<v Speaker 5>cause it's light.</v>

2897
01:10:24.490 --> 01:10:25.323
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

2898
01:10:25.640 --> 01:10:26.900
<v Speaker 5>But I mean they're rated to,</v>

2899
01:10:27.620 --> 01:10:28.061
<v Speaker 5>I mean they,</v>

2900
01:10:28.061 --> 01:10:30.470
<v Speaker 5>they go through a whole rigorous testing process and they're,</v>

2901
01:10:30.530 --> 01:10:32.780
<v Speaker 5>they're pretty solid stuff to following things.</v>

2902
01:10:32.790 --> 01:10:34.550
<v Speaker 5>What really freaks me out when they fall.</v>

2903
01:10:34.600 --> 01:10:35.750
<v Speaker 5>Hang on that thing,</v>

2904
01:10:35.930 --> 01:10:36.740
<v Speaker 5>eh?</v>

2905
01:10:36.740 --> 01:10:36.900
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2906
01:10:36.900 --> 01:10:38.390
<v Speaker 5>But you see that so often when,</v>

2907
01:10:38.450 --> 01:10:39.021
<v Speaker 5>as a climber,</v>

2908
01:10:39.021 --> 01:10:39.201
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2909
01:10:39.201 --> 01:10:40.490
<v Speaker 5>that happens all the time.</v>

2910
01:10:40.491 --> 01:10:41.324
<v Speaker 5>And so it's just not,</v>

2911
01:10:41.390 --> 01:10:41.751
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2912
01:10:41.751 --> 01:10:42.590
<v Speaker 5>it's totally normal.</v>

2913
01:10:42.710 --> 01:10:44.630
<v Speaker 5>So climbers are just used to falling and getting,</v>

2914
01:10:44.631 --> 01:10:45.920
<v Speaker 5>so I'm sure like as a fighter,</v>

2915
01:10:45.921 --> 01:10:47.090
<v Speaker 5>you used to get knocked over.</v>

2916
01:10:47.470 --> 01:10:50.690
<v Speaker 5>You don't have any climbers used to falling cause you're always to get better.</v>

2917
01:10:50.691 --> 01:10:51.980
<v Speaker 5>You have to push yourself to failure.</v>

2918
01:10:52.010 --> 01:10:53.150
<v Speaker 5>And so you're constantly falling,</v>

2919
01:10:53.480 --> 01:10:54.050
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2920
01:10:54.050 --> 01:10:55.610
<v Speaker 5>obviously not for Solos but like,</v>

2921
01:10:56.240 --> 01:10:57.320
<v Speaker 5>but you know,</v>

2922
01:10:57.321 --> 01:10:59.750
<v Speaker 5>the majority of the time you have a robe on and you're climbing to failure.</v>

2923
01:11:00.590 --> 01:11:01.430
<v Speaker 5>Now do you,</v>

2924
01:11:01.600 --> 01:11:01.950
<v Speaker 5>when I,</v>

2925
01:11:01.950 --> 01:11:03.140
<v Speaker 5>when I asked you about your diet,</v>

2926
01:11:03.170 --> 01:11:04.790
<v Speaker 5>do you try to stay light?</v>

2927
01:11:04.820 --> 01:11:06.080
<v Speaker 5>Does that make it easier?</v>

2928
01:11:06.220 --> 01:11:07.730
<v Speaker 5>One of the things when we did fear factor,</v>

2929
01:11:07.731 --> 01:11:09.290
<v Speaker 5>one of the stunts that we had was,</v>

2930
01:11:09.291 --> 01:11:09.770
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2931
01:11:09.770 --> 01:11:10.221
<v Speaker 5>people,</v>

2932
01:11:10.221 --> 01:11:13.010
<v Speaker 5>they were hanging over this bridge by their,</v>

2933
01:11:13.920 --> 01:11:15.330
<v Speaker 5>and they dropped into the water.</v>

2934
01:11:15.390 --> 01:11:15.781
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2935
01:11:15.781 --> 01:11:16.470
<v Speaker 5>it wasn't that far,</v>

2936
01:11:16.470 --> 01:11:19.080
<v Speaker 5>but it was just the idea was like who can hang on the longest?</v>

2937
01:11:19.410 --> 01:11:21.570
<v Speaker 5>And women won because they were lighter.</v>

2938
01:11:21.630 --> 01:11:21.811
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2939
01:11:21.811 --> 01:11:24.630
<v Speaker 5>Because they were lighter because we had one guy who was like a,</v>

2940
01:11:24.660 --> 01:11:25.620
<v Speaker 5>like a football player.</v>

2941
01:11:25.650 --> 01:11:26.461
<v Speaker 5>He was big,</v>

2942
01:11:26.461 --> 01:11:27.300
<v Speaker 5>strong guy.</v>

2943
01:11:27.720 --> 01:11:28.860
<v Speaker 5>Could not have that hands.</v>

2944
01:11:28.861 --> 01:11:29.250
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2945
01:11:29.250 --> 01:11:29.510
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

2946
01:11:29.510 --> 01:11:32.030
<v Speaker 5>just small chest muscles.</v>

2947
01:11:32.190 --> 01:11:32.550
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2948
01:11:32.550 --> 01:11:33.331
<v Speaker 5>Well being a big guy,</v>

2949
01:11:33.331 --> 01:11:35.250
<v Speaker 5>he's like a huge liability if you're trying to hang on.</v>

2950
01:11:35.370 --> 01:11:35.551
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2951
01:11:35.551 --> 01:11:36.450
<v Speaker 5>that's what I would imagine.</v>

2952
01:11:36.451 --> 01:11:37.500
<v Speaker 5>So do you,</v>

2953
01:11:37.501 --> 01:11:38.070
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2954
01:11:38.070 --> 01:11:40.940
<v Speaker 5>make sure that you don't gain weight or do you mean,</v>

2955
01:11:41.730 --> 01:11:42.160
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2956
01:11:42.160 --> 01:11:44.850
<v Speaker 5>I love eating pastries and stuff so I don't watch too much,</v>

2957
01:11:44.851 --> 01:11:45.091
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>

2958
01:11:45.091 --> 01:11:45.510
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2959
01:11:45.510 --> 01:11:46.350
<v Speaker 5>but I mean I try,</v>

2960
01:11:46.370 --> 01:11:46.531
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

2961
01:11:46.531 --> 01:11:46.831
<v Speaker 5>for sure.</v>

2962
01:11:46.831 --> 01:11:47.370
<v Speaker 5>Very thin.</v>

2963
01:11:47.370 --> 01:11:48.720
<v Speaker 5>It must be a lot of calories.</v>

2964
01:11:48.810 --> 01:11:49.480
<v Speaker 5>Not that thin.</v>

2965
01:11:49.480 --> 01:11:49.710
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2966
01:11:49.710 --> 01:11:50.370
<v Speaker 5>Chris,</v>

2967
01:11:50.370 --> 01:11:51.203
<v Speaker 5>well you're not fat,</v>

2968
01:11:51.220 --> 01:11:51.820
<v Speaker 5>muscular.</v>

2969
01:11:51.820 --> 01:11:52.660
<v Speaker 5>I didn't mean that.</v>

2970
01:11:53.650 --> 01:11:54.720
<v Speaker 5>Certainly have muscle,</v>

2971
01:11:54.721 --> 01:11:56.930
<v Speaker 5>but I mean you're not a fat guy mean,</v>

2972
01:11:57.840 --> 01:11:58.650
<v Speaker 5>but you can't,</v>

2973
01:11:58.650 --> 01:12:01.380
<v Speaker 5>I mean you couldn't go climbing all the time and it'd be a fat dude,</v>

2974
01:12:01.381 --> 01:12:01.800
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2975
01:12:01.800 --> 01:12:03.060
<v Speaker 5>cause it does burn a lot of calories.</v>

2976
01:12:03.061 --> 01:12:03.211
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

2977
01:12:03.211 --> 01:12:03.330
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2978
01:12:03.330 --> 01:12:03.601
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2979
01:12:03.601 --> 01:12:05.580
<v Speaker 5>well just being outside all the time and exercising,</v>

2980
01:12:05.600 --> 01:12:06.870
<v Speaker 5>it's going to get you pretty fit.</v>

2981
01:12:06.890 --> 01:12:09.060
<v Speaker 5>Like when you have like a big climb that day.</v>

2982
01:12:09.060 --> 01:12:09.600
<v Speaker 5>Do you,</v>

2983
01:12:09.600 --> 01:12:10.500
<v Speaker 5>do you prep yourself?</v>

2984
01:12:10.501 --> 01:12:12.120
<v Speaker 5>Do you have like a pre climb meal?</v>

2985
01:12:12.820 --> 01:12:13.740
<v Speaker 5>Are you pretty much the same?</v>

2986
01:12:13.750 --> 01:12:14.580
<v Speaker 5>All the time?</v>

2987
01:12:14.580 --> 01:12:15.450
<v Speaker 5>I'd just eat stuff.</v>

2988
01:12:15.720 --> 01:12:16.560
<v Speaker 5>Just whatever you want.</v>

2989
01:12:16.740 --> 01:12:17.573
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2990
01:12:17.830 --> 01:12:18.570
<v Speaker 5>I see.</v>

2991
01:12:18.570 --> 01:12:21.630
<v Speaker 5>And so just try not to eat too much or like go hog wild,</v>

2992
01:12:21.631 --> 01:12:22.464
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

2993
01:12:22.530 --> 01:12:23.363
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

2994
01:12:23.520 --> 01:12:24.540
<v Speaker 5>And no drinking.</v>

2995
01:12:24.960 --> 01:12:25.291
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2996
01:12:25.291 --> 01:12:25.771
<v Speaker 5>But that's just,</v>

2997
01:12:25.771 --> 01:12:26.431
<v Speaker 5>cause I'm not into it.</v>

2998
01:12:26.431 --> 01:12:26.910
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

2999
01:12:26.910 --> 01:12:27.900
<v Speaker 5>I just don't like it.</v>

3000
01:12:28.680 --> 01:12:31.590
<v Speaker 5>That seems like the worst place to ever be where that guy was,</v>

3001
01:12:31.591 --> 01:12:33.780
<v Speaker 5>where it was hung over and he was in the middle of the client.</v>

3002
01:12:34.330 --> 01:12:35.050
<v Speaker 5>That's exact.</v>

3003
01:12:35.050 --> 01:12:35.610
<v Speaker 5>That's,</v>

3004
01:12:35.610 --> 01:12:35.870
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3005
01:12:35.870 --> 01:12:37.170
<v Speaker 5>that's part of the reason I don't drink.</v>

3006
01:12:37.230 --> 01:12:38.041
<v Speaker 5>I look at stuff like that.</v>

3007
01:12:38.041 --> 01:12:38.491
<v Speaker 5>I'm just like,</v>

3008
01:12:38.491 --> 01:12:39.600
<v Speaker 5>what does aster,</v>

3009
01:12:40.290 --> 01:12:41.123
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

3010
01:12:41.160 --> 01:12:43.260
<v Speaker 5>What is your mindset while you're climbing?</v>

3011
01:12:43.350 --> 01:12:43.681
<v Speaker 5>What do you,</v>

3012
01:12:43.681 --> 01:12:44.910
<v Speaker 5>what are you thinking of when you're,</v>

3013
01:12:44.911 --> 01:12:45.744
<v Speaker 5>when you're doing it?</v>

3014
01:12:45.780 --> 01:12:46.680
<v Speaker 5>No one's around.</v>

3015
01:12:46.681 --> 01:12:47.514
<v Speaker 5>It's just you.</v>

3016
01:12:47.850 --> 01:12:48.031
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3017
01:12:48.031 --> 01:12:48.411
<v Speaker 5>it depends.</v>

3018
01:12:48.411 --> 01:12:49.470
<v Speaker 5>So like on hard stuff,</v>

3019
01:12:50.250 --> 01:12:51.960
<v Speaker 5>I'm probably not really thinking about anything.</v>

3020
01:12:51.961 --> 01:12:54.740
<v Speaker 5>I'm just executing the movements that I have to do.</v>

3021
01:12:54.910 --> 01:12:55.291
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3022
01:12:55.291 --> 01:12:58.680
<v Speaker 5>what people say about being in the moment or a flow and all that kind of stuff.</v>

3023
01:12:58.681 --> 01:12:58.921
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

3024
01:12:58.921 --> 01:13:01.590
<v Speaker 5>I'm just doing what I do on easy stuff.</v>

3025
01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:05.400
<v Speaker 5>It's the same as like going jogging or swimming laps or anything where you just</v>

3026
01:13:05.490 --> 01:13:06.900
<v Speaker 5>think about whatever you think about dinner.</v>

3027
01:13:06.901 --> 01:13:09.120
<v Speaker 5>I think about your to do list and things like that.</v>

3028
01:13:09.410 --> 01:13:10.243
<v Speaker 5>Just so when they,</v>

3029
01:13:10.350 --> 01:13:14.100
<v Speaker 5>when it gets to the point where you must focus exactly on what you're doing,</v>

3030
01:13:14.130 --> 01:13:15.510
<v Speaker 5>that's what you like it.</v>

3031
01:13:16.050 --> 01:13:16.321
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3032
01:13:16.321 --> 01:13:16.561
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

3033
01:13:16.561 --> 01:13:20.010
<v Speaker 5>I mean there's something fun about just going out and going jogging too,</v>

3034
01:13:20.011 --> 01:13:20.221
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3035
01:13:20.221 --> 01:13:22.230
<v Speaker 5>like just climbing up a big peak or something.</v>

3036
01:13:22.231 --> 01:13:23.790
<v Speaker 5>And then when you get to the top looking around and being like,</v>

3037
01:13:23.791 --> 01:13:24.570
<v Speaker 5>Oh that was fun.</v>

3038
01:13:24.570 --> 01:13:26.070
<v Speaker 5>But keeping her really mellow the whole time.</v>

3039
01:13:26.280 --> 01:13:27.120
<v Speaker 5>But for sure the,</v>

3040
01:13:27.121 --> 01:13:27.990
<v Speaker 5>the harder stuff,</v>

3041
01:13:28.020 --> 01:13:30.060
<v Speaker 5>when it requires that extra little something,</v>

3042
01:13:30.090 --> 01:13:31.380
<v Speaker 5>I mean that is more rewarding.</v>

3043
01:13:31.570 --> 01:13:35.070
<v Speaker 5>What does it feel like when you get to the top of like hard stuff?</v>

3044
01:13:35.071 --> 01:13:39.540
<v Speaker 5>You just have crazy shit like I'm in generally it gives kind of a general</v>

3045
01:13:39.541 --> 01:13:40.210
<v Speaker 5>satisfaction.</v>

3046
01:13:40.210 --> 01:13:40.381
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3047
01:13:40.381 --> 01:13:40.681
<v Speaker 5>you're like,</v>

3048
01:13:40.681 --> 01:13:41.560
<v Speaker 5>that's red and Jay.</v>

3049
01:13:41.640 --> 01:13:41.851
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3050
01:13:41.851 --> 01:13:43.890
<v Speaker 5>and also you're always in these beautiful places.</v>

3051
01:13:43.891 --> 01:13:45.000
<v Speaker 5>The view's always amazing.</v>

3052
01:13:45.290 --> 01:13:45.480
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3053
01:13:45.480 --> 01:13:47.610
<v Speaker 5>you're always by yourself doing something really cool.</v>

3054
01:13:47.611 --> 01:13:49.260
<v Speaker 5>So I mean there's always that like,</v>

3055
01:13:49.500 --> 01:13:49.790
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3056
01:13:49.790 --> 01:13:51.840
<v Speaker 5>Alation with like being where you are.</v>

3057
01:13:51.870 --> 01:13:53.940
<v Speaker 5>But then there's also that deep satisfaction of like,</v>

3058
01:13:53.970 --> 01:13:56.220
<v Speaker 5>I just did something very hard and did it well.</v>

3059
01:13:56.420 --> 01:13:56.880
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3060
01:13:56.880 --> 01:14:01.800
<v Speaker 5>how many chicks started bombing on you once you had this 60 minutes piece sued?</v>

3061
01:14:01.801 --> 01:14:02.220
<v Speaker 5>Not that,</v>

3062
01:14:02.220 --> 01:14:02.880
<v Speaker 5>not that many.</v>

3063
01:14:02.880 --> 01:14:03.720
<v Speaker 5>Get the fuck out of here.</v>

3064
01:14:03.721 --> 01:14:04.501
<v Speaker 5>That's ridiculous.</v>

3065
01:14:04.501 --> 01:14:06.240
<v Speaker 5>I don't believe that I don't have that much game.</v>

3066
01:14:06.480 --> 01:14:07.050
<v Speaker 5>But you don't have,</v>

3067
01:14:07.050 --> 01:14:07.883
<v Speaker 5>you don't need any game.</v>

3068
01:14:07.890 --> 01:14:08.950
<v Speaker 5>I live in a band,</v>

3069
01:14:11.180 --> 01:14:12.350

3074
01:14:16.930 --> 01:14:18.350

3075
01:14:18.410 --> 01:14:19.243
<v Speaker 1>That's ridiculous.</v>

3076
01:14:19.580 --> 01:14:21.200
<v Speaker 1>You're this climbing freak.</v>

3077
01:14:21.380 --> 01:14:21.771
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3078
01:14:21.771 --> 01:14:24.370
<v Speaker 1>That in itself is game maybe.</v>

3079
01:14:24.530 --> 01:14:24.801
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3080
01:14:24.801 --> 01:14:25.910

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3082
01:14:26.331 --> 01:14:27.310
<v Speaker 1>it might not be your,</v>

3083
01:14:27.311 --> 01:14:28.580
<v Speaker 1>your main motivation,</v>

3084
01:14:28.581 --> 01:14:29.414
<v Speaker 1>but for,</v>

3085
01:14:29.500 --> 01:14:29.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3086
01:14:29.930 --> 01:14:30.980
<v Speaker 1>most human beings,</v>

3087
01:14:30.981 --> 01:14:33.560
<v Speaker 1>one of the reasons why they get really good at shit is to get pussy.</v>

3088
01:14:33.740 --> 01:14:34.210
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3089
01:14:34.210 --> 01:14:34.430
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

3090
01:14:34.430 --> 01:14:34.851
<v Speaker 5>for sure.</v>

3091
01:14:34.851 --> 01:14:36.710
<v Speaker 5>As I was getting better at climbing every,</v>

3092
01:14:36.711 --> 01:14:36.951
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3093
01:14:36.951 --> 01:14:37.670
<v Speaker 5>every time I was like,</v>

3094
01:14:37.670 --> 01:14:37.851
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

3095
01:14:37.851 --> 01:14:39.620
<v Speaker 5>if I got on the cover of a climbing magazine,</v>

3096
01:14:39.650 --> 01:14:41.700
<v Speaker 5>then I'd get laid and then,</v>

3097
01:14:41.990 --> 01:14:43.280
<v Speaker 5>and then you get on the cover and you're like,</v>

3098
01:14:43.281 --> 01:14:43.730
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>

<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

3102
01:14:46.340 --> 01:14:46.850
<v Speaker 5>And then you're like,</v>

3103
01:14:46.850 --> 01:14:47.240
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

3104
01:14:47.240 --> 01:14:49.430
<v Speaker 5>if I get interviewed and like men's journal or something,</v>

3105
01:14:49.431 --> 01:14:50.570
<v Speaker 5>then I'll start getting laid.</v>

3106
01:14:50.571 --> 01:14:51.231
<v Speaker 5>And then you're like,</v>

3107
01:14:51.231 --> 01:14:51.471
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>

3108

<v Speaker 5>turns out nobody reads that shit either.</v>

3109
01:14:53.030 --> 01:14:53.840
<v Speaker 5>You know.</v>

3110
01:14:53.840 --> 01:14:55.190
<v Speaker 5>I wouldn't feel like men's journal,</v>

3111
01:14:55.191 --> 01:14:56.920
<v Speaker 5>like all those fitness magazines,</v>

3112
01:14:56.940 --> 01:15:00.700
<v Speaker 5>you buy it and when you're at the airport and you'd let go at that like that and</v>

3113
01:15:00.701 --> 01:15:04.400
<v Speaker 5>they leave in your fucking cover of national geographic,</v>

3114
01:15:04.710 --> 01:15:05.101
<v Speaker 5>all that.</v>

3115
01:15:05.101 --> 01:15:06.870
<v Speaker 5>That'll get me laid like turns out no.</v>

3116
01:15:07.790 --> 01:15:08.960
<v Speaker 1>Well not a lot of people reading</v>

3117
01:15:11.050 --> 01:15:12.490
<v Speaker 1>the problem.</v>

3118
01:15:12.650 --> 01:15:13.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3119
01:15:13.070 --> 01:15:14.210
<v Speaker 1>But that 60 minutes piece,</v>

3120
01:15:14.211 --> 01:15:17.270
<v Speaker 1>that had to be a big difference between everything else he did and then the</v>

3121
01:15:17.271 --> 01:15:18.830
<v Speaker 1>subsequent viewings of it on the Internet.</v>

3122
01:15:18.860 --> 01:15:19.071
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3123
01:15:19.071 --> 01:15:19.461
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

3124
01:15:19.461 --> 01:15:20.271
<v Speaker 1>I found out about it.</v>

3125
01:15:20.271 --> 01:15:21.230
<v Speaker 1>I didn't see it live.</v>

3126
01:15:21.770 --> 01:15:22.191
<v Speaker 1>It was a,</v>

3127
01:15:22.191 --> 01:15:23.024
<v Speaker 1>I think Twitter thing.</v>

3128
01:15:23.060 --> 01:15:24.060
<v Speaker 1>Someone sent me a link and said,</v>

3129
01:15:24.061 --> 01:15:24.894
<v Speaker 1>you've got to check this out.</v>

3130
01:15:25.620 --> 01:15:29.600
<v Speaker 1>And I think I jumped out of my chair and I climbed on top of it.</v>

3131
01:15:29.601 --> 01:15:32.030
<v Speaker 1>Like those cartoons where there's a mouse on the ground,</v>

3132
01:15:32.300 --> 01:15:32.651
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3135
01:15:36.471 --> 01:15:36.900

01:15:36.900 --> 01:15:38.750
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is he doing?</v>

3141
01:15:48.941 --> 01:15:49.870
<v Speaker 5>There was some online thing,</v>

3142
01:15:49.871 --> 01:15:53.620
<v Speaker 5>it was like a fuzzy dice ESPN like list of top athletes or some shit.</v>

3143
01:15:53.621 --> 01:15:56.200
<v Speaker 5>And I beat Coby Bryant because I hadn't had a sex scandal,</v>

3144
01:15:56.500 --> 01:15:56.770
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3145
01:15:56.770 --> 01:15:58.870
<v Speaker 5>because they had this whole algorithm that like,</v>

3146
01:15:59.080 --> 01:15:59.291
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3147
01:15:59.291 --> 01:16:01.540
<v Speaker 5>took it and all of these different things that you've done versus,</v>

3148
01:16:01.780 --> 01:16:04.780
<v Speaker 5>but then divided by the number of terrible scandals you've had and all that dude</v>

3149
01:16:04.781 --> 01:16:06.820
<v Speaker 5>up beat Kobee because I live clean,</v>

3152
01:16:10.370 --> 01:16:11.203
<v Speaker 1>That's hilarious.</v>

3153
01:16:11.240 --> 01:16:15.050
<v Speaker 1>I forgot what that one also shows how stupid that fucking thing is that the</v>

3154
01:16:15.620 --> 01:16:18.290
<v Speaker 1>algorithm is retarded.</v>

3155
01:16:18.590 --> 01:16:18.980
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

3156
01:16:18.980 --> 01:16:19.461
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

3157
01:16:19.461 --> 01:16:20.294
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was pretty funny.</v>

3158
01:16:21.710 --> 01:16:23.090
<v Speaker 1>It is pretty funny now,</v>

3159
01:16:23.091 --> 01:16:23.600
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3160
01:16:23.600 --> 01:16:24.433
<v Speaker 1>have,</v>

3161
01:16:25.280 --> 01:16:30.280
<v Speaker 1>have there been traditionally a lot of girls that do this solo on there too?</v>

3162
01:16:32.630 --> 01:16:33.650
<v Speaker 1>I think too,</v>

3163
01:16:34.350 --> 01:16:35.670
<v Speaker 5>in the world ever.</v>

3164
01:16:35.940 --> 01:16:36.510
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

3165
01:16:36.510 --> 01:16:36.691
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3166
01:16:36.691 --> 01:16:37.260
<v Speaker 5>basically.</v>

3167
01:16:37.260 --> 01:16:38.040
<v Speaker 5>Basically no,</v>

3168
01:16:38.040 --> 01:16:40.680
<v Speaker 5>but there are a handful of girls that do do that,</v>

3169
01:16:40.920 --> 01:16:43.680
<v Speaker 5>but are there girls that do like a lot of the rope stuff?</v>

3170
01:16:43.870 --> 01:16:44.110
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3171
01:16:44.110 --> 01:16:44.401
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3172
01:16:44.401 --> 01:16:45.180
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3173
01:16:45.180 --> 01:16:45.991
<v Speaker 5>especially in Europe,</v>

3174
01:16:45.991 --> 01:16:46.830
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's probably 50,</v>

3175
01:16:46.831 --> 01:16:47.491
<v Speaker 5>50 split,</v>

3176
01:16:47.491 --> 01:16:47.880
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3177
01:16:47.880 --> 01:16:49.260
<v Speaker 5>real in the u s maybe it's 60,</v>

3178
01:16:49.261 --> 01:16:50.130
<v Speaker 5>40 or 70.</v>

3179
01:16:50.131 --> 01:16:50.431
<v Speaker 5>30.</v>

3180
01:16:50.431 --> 01:16:51.420
<v Speaker 5>But it's that big.</v>

3181
01:16:51.450 --> 01:16:51.630
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3182
01:16:51.630 --> 01:16:53.820
<v Speaker 5>It's pretty close to get audience buddy.</v>

3183
01:16:53.880 --> 01:16:54.061
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3184
01:16:54.061 --> 01:16:55.900
<v Speaker 5>I mean if you go to a gym style for you,</v>

3185
01:16:56.630 --> 01:16:57.490
<v Speaker 5>then now this town,</v>

3186
01:16:57.491 --> 01:16:58.324
<v Speaker 5>as far as chicks,</v>

3187
01:16:58.520 --> 01:16:59.310
<v Speaker 5>you need to go.</v>

3188
01:16:59.310 --> 01:17:01.170
<v Speaker 5>Those are the ones who are going to be the most impressed with you.</v>

3189
01:17:01.490 --> 01:17:01.950
<v Speaker 5>You're what?</v>

3190
01:17:01.950 --> 01:17:03.430
<v Speaker 5>They're all private gravel faces.</v>

3191
01:17:06.270 --> 01:17:08.610
<v Speaker 5>Their faces have holes all over it.</v>

3192
01:17:08.780 --> 01:17:09.770
<v Speaker 5>Gravel face.</v>

3193
01:17:09.771 --> 01:17:10.250
<v Speaker 5>Why</v>

3194
01:17:10.250 --> 01:17:11.450
<v Speaker 6>he doesn't have from hitting?</v>

3195
01:17:11.480 --> 01:17:12.190
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

3196
01:17:12.190 --> 01:17:12.830
<v Speaker 6>it looks fine.</v>

3197
01:17:12.830 --> 01:17:12.981
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

3198
01:17:12.981 --> 01:17:13.910
<v Speaker 6>but they probably have it in there.</v>

3199
01:17:13.911 --> 01:17:14.990
<v Speaker 6>I'm not even gonna go there.</v>

3200
01:17:15.740 --> 01:17:16.890
<v Speaker 6>Probably fuck up more though.</v>

3201
01:17:17.900 --> 01:17:18.830
<v Speaker 6>Is that what you were going to say?</v>

3202
01:17:19.530 --> 01:17:19.831
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3203
01:17:19.831 --> 01:17:20.400
<v Speaker 5>honestly,</v>

3204
01:17:20.400 --> 01:17:22.950
<v Speaker 5>nowadays are the majority of climbers climbing the gym in a city.</v>

3205
01:17:23.050 --> 01:17:23.700
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3206
01:17:23.700 --> 01:17:25.350
<v Speaker 5>it's not like rugged mountain people.</v>

3207
01:17:25.351 --> 01:17:28.320
<v Speaker 5>It's just like college kids and stuff to like go bolder in the gym.</v>

3208
01:17:28.490 --> 01:17:29.370
<v Speaker 5>And that's how you started.</v>

3209
01:17:29.371 --> 01:17:30.830
<v Speaker 5>You started in Sacramento.</v>

3210
01:17:31.240 --> 01:17:32.130
<v Speaker 5>Bad Ass town.</v>

3211
01:17:32.131 --> 01:17:32.940
<v Speaker 5>Love Sacramento.</v>

3212
01:17:32.940 --> 01:17:35.550
<v Speaker 5>Really liked doing standup up there.</v>

3213
01:17:36.100 --> 01:17:36.933
<v Speaker 5>They're wild.</v>

3214
01:17:37.110 --> 01:17:37.861
<v Speaker 5>It's like a,</v>

3215
01:17:37.861 --> 01:17:39.570
<v Speaker 5>it's like a combination of,</v>

3216
01:17:39.571 --> 01:17:40.404
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3217
01:17:40.470 --> 01:17:42.180
<v Speaker 5>like country people and city people.</v>

3218
01:17:42.181 --> 01:17:44.310
<v Speaker 5>It's like a weird sort of a blend,</v>

3219
01:17:44.660 --> 01:17:44.930
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

3220
01:17:44.930 --> 01:17:45.330
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3221
01:17:45.330 --> 01:17:46.350
<v Speaker 5>It's kind of a Hickish city.</v>

3222
01:17:46.780 --> 01:17:47.190
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3223
01:17:47.190 --> 01:17:48.023
<v Speaker 5>that's what I'm saying.</v>

3224
01:17:48.060 --> 01:17:48.211
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>

3225
01:17:48.211 --> 01:17:49.920
<v Speaker 5>these people that,</v>

3226
01:17:49.950 --> 01:17:54.110
<v Speaker 5>that do these rock climbing gyms like that own them and stuff that,</v>

3227
01:17:54.111 --> 01:17:55.880
<v Speaker 5>do most of them do the stuff that you like,</v>

3228
01:17:56.010 --> 01:17:57.000
<v Speaker 5>not the stuff that you do,</v>

3229
01:17:57.001 --> 01:17:57.560
<v Speaker 5>but the,</v>

3230
01:17:57.560 --> 01:17:58.321
<v Speaker 5>the mountain stuff,</v>

3231
01:17:58.321 --> 01:17:59.760
<v Speaker 5>or is there a two distinct camps?</v>

3232
01:17:59.761 --> 01:18:03.570
<v Speaker 5>There's people who just do Jim rock climbing and you know,</v>

3233
01:18:03.630 --> 01:18:04.950
<v Speaker 5>I wouldn't say that they're distinct camps,</v>

3234
01:18:04.951 --> 01:18:07.290
<v Speaker 5>but for sure there are people who just climb in the gym,</v>

3235
01:18:07.530 --> 01:18:09.150
<v Speaker 5>especially like the Bay area around,</v>

3236
01:18:09.151 --> 01:18:09.610
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3237
01:18:09.610 --> 01:18:09.880
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3238
01:18:09.880 --> 01:18:11.160
<v Speaker 5>San Francisco and Berkeley and all that.</v>

3239
01:18:11.400 --> 01:18:12.060
<v Speaker 5>They're probably,</v>

3240
01:18:12.060 --> 01:18:12.460
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3241
01:18:12.460 --> 01:18:14.340
<v Speaker 5>thousands of climbers that to them,</v>

3242
01:18:14.341 --> 01:18:16.020
<v Speaker 5>rock climbing just means going to the gym.</v>

3243
01:18:16.180 --> 01:18:16.530
<v Speaker 5>Hmm.</v>

3244
01:18:16.530 --> 01:18:16.831
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3245
01:18:16.831 --> 01:18:17.664
<v Speaker 5>but then,</v>

3246
01:18:18.030 --> 01:18:19.590
<v Speaker 5>but then maybe half the people in the gym,</v>

3247
01:18:19.591 --> 01:18:21.410
<v Speaker 5>also God doors every weekend and all that.</v>

3248
01:18:21.510 --> 01:18:21.990
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3249
01:18:21.990 --> 01:18:23.340
<v Speaker 5>it would seem to me that the,</v>

3250
01:18:23.580 --> 01:18:27.560
<v Speaker 5>the rock climbing that Jim could not be nearly as exciting even if it was real</v>

3251
01:18:27.580 --> 01:18:28.050
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>

3252
01:18:28.050 --> 01:18:28.600
<v Speaker 5>but you know,</v>

3253
01:18:28.600 --> 01:18:29.610
<v Speaker 5>I mean whatever,</v>

3254
01:18:29.630 --> 01:18:32.460
<v Speaker 5>they're also people doing like zoom button in the gym to work out or whatever</v>

3255
01:18:32.461 --> 01:18:32.790
<v Speaker 5>that meant.</v>

3256
01:18:32.790 --> 01:18:33.301
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>

3257
01:18:33.301 --> 01:18:37.470
<v Speaker 5>Like chooses something and climbing and certainly like more fun than,</v>

3258
01:18:37.500 --> 01:18:38.700
<v Speaker 5>than most ways to work out.</v>

3259
01:18:38.701 --> 01:18:41.100
<v Speaker 5>You know what I was going to get to is when you first started,</v>

3260
01:18:41.101 --> 01:18:43.110
<v Speaker 5>you did it in the gym and what,</v>

3261
01:18:43.111 --> 01:18:43.470
<v Speaker 5>when,</v>

3262
01:18:43.470 --> 01:18:45.600
<v Speaker 5>what was the feeling when you did your first mountain?</v>

3263
01:18:46.170 --> 01:18:50.340
<v Speaker 5>You mean like big outdoor climbing and she was like going from doing it in the</v>

3264
01:18:50.341 --> 01:18:52.230
<v Speaker 5>gym to going to a mountain and you know,</v>

3265
01:18:52.231 --> 01:18:52.900
<v Speaker 5>in climate.</v>

3266
01:18:52.900 --> 01:18:54.240
<v Speaker 5>I mean honestly the first,</v>

3267
01:18:54.300 --> 01:18:57.030
<v Speaker 5>the first time climbing outside I liked didn't like it as much cause it was</v>

3268
01:18:57.031 --> 01:18:57.211
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

3269
01:18:57.211 --> 01:18:58.800
<v Speaker 5>oh how do you find the holds and all that,</v>

3270
01:18:58.801 --> 01:18:58.991
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3271
01:18:58.991 --> 01:18:59.641
<v Speaker 5>like how do you do it?</v>

3272
01:18:59.641 --> 01:19:01.230
<v Speaker 5>Cause it's like different sports really.</v>

3273
01:19:01.231 --> 01:19:02.064
<v Speaker 5>I didn't know how to do it.</v>

3274
01:19:02.430 --> 01:19:04.290
<v Speaker 5>But then as I've learned and as I got more into it,</v>

3275
01:19:04.291 --> 01:19:07.230
<v Speaker 5>you start to appreciate and you're certainly in a more beautiful location,</v>

3276
01:19:07.231 --> 01:19:07.441
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

3277
01:19:07.441 --> 01:19:08.340
<v Speaker 5>That's kind of the main thing.</v>

3278
01:19:08.730 --> 01:19:11.910
<v Speaker 5>Does it give you a different sense of accomplishment is what I was trying to get</v>

3279
01:19:11.911 --> 01:19:12.080
<v Speaker 5>at?</v>

3280
01:19:12.080 --> 01:19:12.220
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3281
01:19:12.220 --> 01:19:12.571
<v Speaker 5>for sure.</v>

3282
01:19:12.571 --> 01:19:13.440
<v Speaker 5>It just feels different,</v>

3283
01:19:13.441 --> 01:19:13.561
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3284
01:19:13.561 --> 01:19:13.681
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3285
01:19:13.681 --> 01:19:16.230
<v Speaker 5>I mean when you get to the top of something in the gym yet,</v>

3286
01:19:16.460 --> 01:19:18.660
<v Speaker 5>you know there's some satisfaction in the physical achievement.</v>

3287
01:19:18.661 --> 01:19:18.930
<v Speaker 5>You're like,</v>

3288
01:19:18.930 --> 01:19:19.111
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

3289
01:19:19.111 --> 01:19:20.270
<v Speaker 5>I'm stronger than I used to be.</v>

3290
01:19:20.271 --> 01:19:21.690
<v Speaker 5>Or I learned how to do some technique.</v>

3291
01:19:21.960 --> 01:19:23.640
<v Speaker 5>But like when you get to the top of something outside,</v>

3292
01:19:23.641 --> 01:19:23.970
<v Speaker 5>you're like,</v>

3293
01:19:23.970 --> 01:19:24.900
<v Speaker 5>that was rad.</v>

3294
01:19:24.990 --> 01:19:25.261
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3295
01:19:25.261 --> 01:19:26.850
<v Speaker 5>like this is a worthy objective,</v>

3296
01:19:26.851 --> 01:19:27.181
<v Speaker 5>whatever.</v>

3297
01:19:27.181 --> 01:19:28.014
<v Speaker 5>It's like inherently,</v>

3298
01:19:28.020 --> 01:19:28.320
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3299
01:19:28.320 --> 01:19:29.340
<v Speaker 5>it has more inherent in eating.</v>

3300
01:19:29.970 --> 01:19:32.160
<v Speaker 5>One of the things I saw on the 60 minutes thing,</v>

3301
01:19:32.161 --> 01:19:33.810
<v Speaker 5>so they asked you to hold up your fingers.</v>

3302
01:19:34.230 --> 01:19:34.980
<v Speaker 5>You have a,</v>

3303
01:19:34.980 --> 01:19:36.660
<v Speaker 5>you have really big like fat fingers.</v>

3304
01:19:36.661 --> 01:19:37.494
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

3305
01:19:37.680 --> 01:19:41.040
<v Speaker 5>That's know from just climbing and clawing at things.</v>

3306
01:19:41.070 --> 01:19:41.220
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3307
01:19:41.220 --> 01:19:43.950
<v Speaker 5>I think it was maybe from climbing cracks where you put them in a wedge and</v>

3308
01:19:43.951 --> 01:19:44.790
<v Speaker 5>Torque on them and stuff.</v>

3309
01:19:45.030 --> 01:19:48.510
<v Speaker 5>Did you have to condition your hands in any way or did it just happen?</v>

3310
01:19:50.070 --> 01:19:51.490
<v Speaker 5>This is 17 years of climbing,</v>

3311
01:19:51.491 --> 01:19:52.110
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

3312
01:19:52.110 --> 01:19:53.610
<v Speaker 6>Well that's what you need to tell girls.</v>

3313
01:19:53.840 --> 01:19:57.270
<v Speaker 6>Like girls need to know that if they know about his hands and his strong</v>

3314
01:19:57.271 --> 01:19:58.080
<v Speaker 6>fingers.</v>

3315
01:19:58.080 --> 01:19:59.640
<v Speaker 6>Do you think that means that he is a strong deck?</v>

3316
01:19:59.660 --> 01:20:00.391
<v Speaker 6>Is that what I'm saying?</v>

3317
01:20:00.391 --> 01:20:01.680
<v Speaker 6>That he's really highly powerful</v>

3318
01:20:02.220 --> 01:20:03.020
<v Speaker 5>as many years.</v>

3319
01:20:03.020 --> 01:20:03.540
<v Speaker 5>What's that?</v>

3320
01:20:03.540 --> 01:20:04.660
<v Speaker 5>I have a condition for this</v>

3321
01:20:07.050 --> 01:20:08.280
<v Speaker 6>helps you wedge in the cracks.</v>

3322
01:20:08.600 --> 01:20:09.480
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3323
01:20:10.140 --> 01:20:10.950
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3324
01:20:10.950 --> 01:20:11.191
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3325
01:20:11.191 --> 01:20:11.781
<v Speaker 5>So you,</v>

3326
01:20:11.781 --> 01:20:15.570
<v Speaker 5>you have to like at some point in some time where you're literally getting like</v>

3327
01:20:15.571 --> 01:20:18.210
<v Speaker 5>two inches of your fingers in a crack or less.</v>

3328
01:20:18.211 --> 01:20:18.600
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3329
01:20:18.600 --> 01:20:19.433
<v Speaker 5>less evil.</v>

3330
01:20:19.800 --> 01:20:22.180
<v Speaker 5>What's the smallest amount that you're actually holding your body?</v>

3331
01:20:23.120 --> 01:20:23.953
<v Speaker 5>An inch.</v>

3332
01:20:24.350 --> 01:20:26.850
<v Speaker 5>I mean the just like half of your last pad.</v>

3333
01:20:26.970 --> 01:20:27.890
<v Speaker 5>So half of the day.</v>

3334
01:20:29.600 --> 01:20:30.433
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3335
01:20:30.940 --> 01:20:31.291
<v Speaker 5>And that's,</v>

3336
01:20:31.291 --> 01:20:32.640
<v Speaker 5>you're holding your whole body up.</v>

3337
01:20:32.850 --> 01:20:33.061
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3338
01:20:33.061 --> 01:20:33.301
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3339
01:20:33.301 --> 01:20:34.590
<v Speaker 5>you have your feet on things too.</v>

3340
01:20:34.820 --> 01:20:35.161
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3341
01:20:35.161 --> 01:20:35.881
<v Speaker 5>probably really,</v>

3342
01:20:35.881 --> 01:20:36.720
<v Speaker 5>really small things.</v>

3343
01:20:36.721 --> 01:20:39.270
<v Speaker 5>But Jesus Christ,</v>

3344
01:20:39.510 --> 01:20:39.751
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3345
01:20:39.751 --> 01:20:40.051
<v Speaker 5>it can't be,</v>

3346
01:20:40.051 --> 01:20:40.541
<v Speaker 5>I mean that,</v>

3347
01:20:40.541 --> 01:20:41.820
<v Speaker 5>that would be like when it's really hard,</v>

3348
01:20:42.360 --> 01:20:42.571
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3349
01:20:42.571 --> 01:20:43.231
<v Speaker 5>best case scenario,</v>

3350
01:20:43.231 --> 01:20:44.640
<v Speaker 5>you have your whole hand sunk in,</v>

3351
01:20:44.641 --> 01:20:44.881
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3352
01:20:44.881 --> 01:20:49.410
<v Speaker 5>and it's like attached to the mouse grip like cracks,</v>

3353
01:20:49.411 --> 01:20:53.160
<v Speaker 5>the most difficult thing to navigate no cracks or actually like the most secure</v>

3354
01:20:53.161 --> 01:20:54.440
<v Speaker 5>thing to navigate really is a,</v>

3355
01:20:54.750 --> 01:20:57.630
<v Speaker 5>because once you put your fingers in or your hand in you can,</v>

3356
01:20:57.631 --> 01:20:58.110
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3357
01:20:58.110 --> 01:20:59.820
<v Speaker 5>so like if you put your hand into a crack,</v>

3358
01:21:00.090 --> 01:21:03.610
<v Speaker 5>you move your thumb down and gets fatter and then it wedges and shape like a</v>

3359
01:21:03.611 --> 01:21:04.020
<v Speaker 5>sort of,</v>

3360
01:21:04.020 --> 01:21:05.210
<v Speaker 5>sort of like a camming device.</v>

3361
01:21:05.220 --> 01:21:07.770
<v Speaker 5>Like I was talking and you just make your hand fatter and then it gets locked in</v>

3362
01:21:07.771 --> 01:21:08.550
<v Speaker 5>place.</v>

3363
01:21:08.550 --> 01:21:10.200
<v Speaker 5>And so once you have your hand locked in like that,</v>

3364
01:21:10.201 --> 01:21:10.411
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3365
01:21:10.411 --> 01:21:11.244
<v Speaker 5>you could just,</v>

3366
01:21:11.610 --> 01:21:11.880
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3367
01:21:11.880 --> 01:21:12.240
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3368
01:21:12.240 --> 01:21:13.021
<v Speaker 5>you just hang off.</v>

3369
01:21:13.021 --> 01:21:13.530
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

3370
01:21:13.530 --> 01:21:13.681
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

3371
01:21:13.681 --> 01:21:13.951
<v Speaker 5>exactly.</v>

3372
01:21:13.951 --> 01:21:14.784
<v Speaker 5>You Shit your pants.</v>

3373
01:21:14.820 --> 01:21:15.653
<v Speaker 5>Totally fine.</v>

3374
01:21:16.200 --> 01:21:18.150
<v Speaker 5>But so like when I'm climbing a hand jams,</v>

3375
01:21:18.151 --> 01:21:20.490
<v Speaker 5>like it feels like I'm walking or something,</v>

3376
01:21:20.520 --> 01:21:20.761
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3377
01:21:20.761 --> 01:21:21.594
<v Speaker 5>I'm just like,</v>

3378
01:21:21.610 --> 01:21:22.070
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3379
01:21:22.070 --> 01:21:22.710
<v Speaker 5>I can climb.</v>

3380
01:21:22.710 --> 01:21:22.891
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3381
01:21:22.891 --> 01:21:26.430
<v Speaker 5>I have climbed thousands and thousands of feet of hand jams like with no,</v>

3382
01:21:26.460 --> 01:21:26.731
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3383
01:21:26.731 --> 01:21:27.564
<v Speaker 5>just whatever.</v>

3384
01:21:27.990 --> 01:21:28.650
<v Speaker 5>Nope.</v>

3385
01:21:28.650 --> 01:21:30.420
<v Speaker 5>You've been doing this for 17 years.</v>

3386
01:21:30.720 --> 01:21:32.250
<v Speaker 5>What keeps you doing this?</v>

3387
01:21:32.370 --> 01:21:34.510
<v Speaker 5>What is just rad?</v>

3388
01:21:35.060 --> 01:21:35.893
<v Speaker 5>Awesome.</v>

3389
01:21:35.970 --> 01:21:36.550
<v Speaker 5>I mean after,</v>

3390
01:21:36.550 --> 01:21:37.141
<v Speaker 5>as soon as we're done,</v>

3391
01:21:37.141 --> 01:21:41.070
<v Speaker 5>I'm driving to Vegas to go climbing again and then I'm flying to Mexico in a</v>

3392
01:21:41.070 --> 01:21:42.210
<v Speaker 5>couple of days for like a month road trip thing.</v>

3393
01:21:42.570 --> 01:21:44.700
<v Speaker 5>And when you're doing a lot of these,</v>

3394
01:21:44.701 --> 01:21:46.110
<v Speaker 5>you're doing them just by yourself.</v>

3395
01:21:46.140 --> 01:21:46.891
<v Speaker 5>You just pulling up,</v>

3396
01:21:46.891 --> 01:21:48.120
<v Speaker 5>showing up and climbing.</v>

3397
01:21:49.380 --> 01:21:50.120
<v Speaker 5>I wouldn't say,</v>

3398
01:21:50.120 --> 01:21:51.990
<v Speaker 5>I mean the big soul is the stuff that you've seen.</v>

3399
01:21:51.991 --> 01:21:54.870
<v Speaker 5>I mean I maybe do like four or five days like that a year.</v>

3400
01:21:55.310 --> 01:21:55.950
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

3401
01:21:55.950 --> 01:21:57.360
<v Speaker 5>Those are so that you're doing with ropes?</v>

3402
01:21:57.680 --> 01:21:58.131
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3403
01:21:58.131 --> 01:22:00.930
<v Speaker 5>I climb with a partner in a rope 99% of the time.</v>

3404
01:22:01.170 --> 01:22:02.010
<v Speaker 5>And then you know,</v>

3405
01:22:02.160 --> 01:22:05.430
<v Speaker 5>the videos and stuff that you've seen or like the playoffs and the super bowl</v>

3406
01:22:05.431 --> 01:22:05.700
<v Speaker 5>of,</v>

3407
01:22:05.700 --> 01:22:06.450
<v Speaker 5>of climbing,</v>

3408
01:22:06.450 --> 01:22:06.781
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3409
01:22:06.781 --> 01:22:08.880
<v Speaker 5>but you're not seeing all the practice and all the like,</v>

3410
01:22:08.970 --> 01:22:09.241
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3411
01:22:09.241 --> 01:22:11.540
<v Speaker 5>the years that go into like getting ready for the Superbowl.</v>

3412
01:22:11.990 --> 01:22:12.930
<v Speaker 5>Oh Wow.</v>

3413
01:22:13.020 --> 01:22:13.920
<v Speaker 5>So for you,</v>

3414
01:22:13.921 --> 01:22:15.390
<v Speaker 5>it's just a thrilling,</v>

3415
01:22:15.391 --> 01:22:17.910
<v Speaker 5>fun thing to do and it hasn't lost any of its charm.</v>

3416
01:22:18.600 --> 01:22:19.140
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3417
01:22:19.140 --> 01:22:20.370
<v Speaker 5>the charm has transitioned.</v>

3418
01:22:20.371 --> 01:22:21.330
<v Speaker 5>I think as I get older,</v>

3419
01:22:21.360 --> 01:22:23.070
<v Speaker 5>like now I love the travel more and like,</v>

3420
01:22:23.300 --> 01:22:23.460
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3421
01:22:23.460 --> 01:22:26.310
<v Speaker 5>I'm pretty excited about going to Mexico and traveling around and like seeing</v>

3422
01:22:26.311 --> 01:22:27.240
<v Speaker 5>new places and all that,</v>

3423
01:22:27.660 --> 01:22:27.900
<v Speaker 5>you know.</v>

3424
01:22:27.900 --> 01:22:28.681
<v Speaker 5>Whereas when I was younger,</v>

3425
01:22:28.681 --> 01:22:31.620
<v Speaker 5>it was just a matter of like trying to do physically do hard news and being</v>

3426
01:22:31.621 --> 01:22:31.830
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

3427
01:22:31.830 --> 01:22:32.041
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

3428
01:22:32.041 --> 01:22:35.370
<v Speaker 5>I can do whatever this boulder problem that I couldn't do before.</v>

3429
01:22:35.371 --> 01:22:35.971
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>

3430
01:22:35.971 --> 01:22:37.140
<v Speaker 5>it was like seeing that growth.</v>

3431
01:22:37.530 --> 01:22:38.250
<v Speaker 5>Now I'm kind of like,</v>

3432
01:22:38.250 --> 01:22:38.641
<v Speaker 5>ah,</v>

3433
01:22:38.641 --> 01:22:38.911
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3434
01:22:38.911 --> 01:22:41.730
<v Speaker 5>there's always somebody who's going to be stronger and better and whatever.</v>

3435
01:22:41.731 --> 01:22:43.540
<v Speaker 5>Like it doesn't really matter how hard the moves are announced,</v>

3436
01:22:43.541 --> 01:22:46.890
<v Speaker 5>the cooler for me to go to like cool places and climb new things and all that.</v>

3437
01:22:46.980 --> 01:22:47.813
<v Speaker 5>But you know what I mean?</v>

3438
01:22:47.850 --> 01:22:48.750
<v Speaker 5>I still love climbing.</v>

3439
01:22:49.740 --> 01:22:50.250
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

3440
01:22:50.250 --> 01:22:55.250
<v Speaker 5>What is your life like now in terms of like media obligations and how much,</v>

3441
01:22:55.320 --> 01:22:56.850
<v Speaker 5>how much of that stuff has changed?</v>

3442

3467
01:23:33.860 --> 01:23:34.381
<v Speaker 5>It seems to work.</v>

3468
01:23:34.381 --> 01:23:34.710

01:25:59.471 --> 01:26:00.690
<v Speaker 5>that is so bizarre.</v>

3587
01:26:00.691 --> 01:26:01.840
<v Speaker 5>It's really pretty landscape.</v>

3588
01:26:01.930 --> 01:26:05.480
<v Speaker 5>You must see like some of the coolest spots in the world when it comes to,</v>

3589
01:26:05.660 --> 01:26:06.170
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3590
01:26:06.170 --> 01:26:07.150
<v Speaker 5>all these climbs here.</v>

3591
01:26:07.160 --> 01:26:07.551
<v Speaker 5>For sure.</v>

3592
01:26:07.551 --> 01:26:07.970
<v Speaker 5>That's like,</v>

3593
01:26:07.970 --> 01:26:10.850
<v Speaker 5>that's what I'm saying that like that is becoming more of the appeal for me.</v>

3594
01:26:10.851 --> 01:26:11.031
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3595
01:26:11.031 --> 01:26:13.790
<v Speaker 5>just to go to these amazing places and climb like cool things.</v>

3596
01:26:14.180 --> 01:26:14.361
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3597
01:26:14.361 --> 01:26:16.340
<v Speaker 5>For folks who've never seen nothing on what we were talking about,</v>

3598
01:26:16.341 --> 01:26:17.810
<v Speaker 5>the sound somehow or another,</v>

3599
01:26:18.050 --> 01:26:19.640
<v Speaker 5>the rock eroded to look.</v>

3600
01:26:19.900 --> 01:26:22.930
<v Speaker 5>It looks like it was constructed like a freestanding art.</v>

3601
01:26:23.100 --> 01:26:23.600
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3602
01:26:23.600 --> 01:26:25.400
<v Speaker 5>Crazy arch may not have stone.</v>

3603
01:26:25.480 --> 01:26:29.600
<v Speaker 5>It just shows you that although the randomness of nature with the weird things</v>

3604
01:26:29.601 --> 01:26:30.434
<v Speaker 5>that can occur,</v>

3605
01:26:30.710 --> 01:26:34.640
<v Speaker 5>I went on a northface expedition to Chad in the dead center of Africa to climb</v>

3606
01:26:34.700 --> 01:26:38.210
<v Speaker 5>unclimbed sandstone and towers and arches like exactly what we're talking about</v>

3607
01:26:38.211 --> 01:26:39.530
<v Speaker 5>in Utah except it was and Chad,</v>

3608
01:26:39.600 --> 01:26:43.070
<v Speaker 5>why we drove across blank empty desert,</v>

3609
01:26:43.130 --> 01:26:45.260
<v Speaker 5>like just completely flat sand with no road,</v>

3610
01:26:45.290 --> 01:26:48.770
<v Speaker 5>just driving gps for three days across like flat nothingness until we got to</v>

3611
01:26:48.771 --> 01:26:49.670
<v Speaker 5>these crazy towers.</v>

3612
01:26:49.700 --> 01:26:50.533
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God,</v>

3613
01:26:50.740 --> 01:26:54.860
<v Speaker 5>you guys are driving for three days through the desert is out of control.</v>

3614
01:26:55.670 --> 01:26:56.451
<v Speaker 5>She drove,</v>

3615
01:26:56.451 --> 01:26:57.530
<v Speaker 5>we drove for two days,</v>

3616
01:26:57.590 --> 01:26:58.560
<v Speaker 5>just flat and knocked me.</v>

3617
01:26:58.561 --> 01:27:00.290
<v Speaker 5>And so you don't see anything in any direction,</v>

3618
01:27:00.390 --> 01:27:02.060
<v Speaker 5>so much gas to drive that long.</v>

3619
01:27:02.330 --> 01:27:02.601
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

3620
01:27:02.601 --> 01:27:03.750
<v Speaker 5>We had this outfit or just,</v>

3621
01:27:03.980 --> 01:27:04.251
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3622
01:27:04.251 --> 01:27:05.084
<v Speaker 5>that's what he does.</v>

3623
01:27:06.590 --> 01:27:07.640
<v Speaker 5>I think he knew how to do it,</v>

3624
01:27:07.641 --> 01:27:08.474
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3625
01:27:08.650 --> 01:27:13.130
<v Speaker 5>but the day's drive well but driving it like 27 miles an hour through the sand.</v>

3626
01:27:13.160 --> 01:27:13.341
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3627
01:27:13.341 --> 01:27:16.490
<v Speaker 5>because you're driving across like it'd be like going to the Mojave desert and</v>

3628
01:27:16.491 --> 01:27:20.360
<v Speaker 5>it's driving cross country completely straight for three days anyway.</v>

3629
01:27:20.361 --> 01:27:23.300
<v Speaker 5>But so after two days we randomly passed these two dudes on camels that were</v>

3630
01:27:23.301 --> 01:27:24.134
<v Speaker 5>doing the same thing.</v>

3631
01:27:24.500 --> 01:27:26.750
<v Speaker 5>They were just questioning across the desert on their camels.</v>

3632
01:27:27.020 --> 01:27:27.801
<v Speaker 5>Randomly,</v>

3633
01:27:27.801 --> 01:27:28.840
<v Speaker 5>randomly rated on the,</v>

3634
01:27:28.850 --> 01:27:30.770
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure they were like going to trade or something.</v>

3635
01:27:30.770 --> 01:27:30.921
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3636
01:27:30.921 --> 01:27:31.754
<v Speaker 5>we just was,</v>

3637
01:27:31.760 --> 01:27:33.140
<v Speaker 5>is there a path you are on?</v>

3638
01:27:33.320 --> 01:27:34.400
<v Speaker 5>That's the thing is we were just,</v>

3639
01:27:34.401 --> 01:27:36.140
<v Speaker 5>we were following gps coordinates across it.</v>

3640
01:27:36.290 --> 01:27:37.160
<v Speaker 5>The Virgin desert,</v>

3641
01:27:37.250 --> 01:27:38.083
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3642
01:27:38.180 --> 01:27:38.751
<v Speaker 5>it was like,</v>

3643
01:27:38.751 --> 01:27:40.100
<v Speaker 5>it was kind of out of control.</v>

3644
01:27:40.340 --> 01:27:40.881
<v Speaker 5>We were like,</v>

3645
01:27:40.881 --> 01:27:43.250
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck are these guys doing out here?</v>

3646
01:27:43.490 --> 01:27:43.731
<v Speaker 5>Why?</v>

3647
01:27:43.731 --> 01:27:44.001
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3648
01:27:44.001 --> 01:27:44.630
<v Speaker 5>and like,</v>

3649
01:27:44.630 --> 01:27:45.463
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

3650
01:27:45.870 --> 01:27:46.790
<v Speaker 5>who were the guys?</v>

3651
01:27:46.820 --> 01:27:48.260
<v Speaker 5>They're just like desert nomad dudes.</v>

3652
01:27:48.261 --> 01:27:48.501
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3653
01:27:48.501 --> 01:27:49.640
<v Speaker 5>just like indigenous folks.</v>

3654
01:27:50.780 --> 01:27:53.000
<v Speaker 5>I mean they were just normal dudes on their normal life,</v>

3655
01:27:53.030 --> 01:27:53.661
<v Speaker 5>but you're just like,</v>

3656
01:27:53.661 --> 01:27:55.310
<v Speaker 5>it's hard to believe that that's their normal life.</v>

3657
01:27:55.311 --> 01:27:58.730
<v Speaker 5>Just like taking a camel for five days across the blank desert with no food or</v>

3658
01:27:58.731 --> 01:27:59.564
<v Speaker 5>water.</v>

3659
01:27:59.600 --> 01:28:02.470
<v Speaker 5>It's hard to wrap your head around the fact that that's how people lived for a</v>

3660
01:28:02.550 --> 01:28:03.380
<v Speaker 5>long,</v>

3661
01:28:03.380 --> 01:28:04.400
<v Speaker 5>that's how people still live.</v>

3662
01:28:04.401 --> 01:28:05.870
<v Speaker 5>That's what's so crazy about going to chat.</v>

3663
01:28:05.871 --> 01:28:06.920
<v Speaker 5>It's like we were meeting,</v>

3664
01:28:07.020 --> 01:28:07.790
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3665
01:28:07.790 --> 01:28:10.640
<v Speaker 5>people that live there that like in their entire life will probably never touch</v>

3666
01:28:10.641 --> 01:28:11.900
<v Speaker 5>pavement or like asphalt,</v>

3667
01:28:11.901 --> 01:28:12.051
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3668
01:28:12.051 --> 01:28:13.760
<v Speaker 5>they just live in sand and that's it.</v>

3669
01:28:13.820 --> 01:28:15.380
<v Speaker 5>But for all of existence,</v>

3670
01:28:15.490 --> 01:28:15.860
<v Speaker 5>they just,</v>

3671
01:28:15.860 --> 01:28:17.010
<v Speaker 5>gender goats 10 there,</v>

3672
01:28:17.080 --> 01:28:20.030
<v Speaker 5>they're a little donkeys and stuff and you're just like,</v>

3673
01:28:20.031 --> 01:28:20.870
<v Speaker 5>oh my God,</v>

3674
01:28:21.440 --> 01:28:23.330
<v Speaker 5>it's pretty hardcore and that,</v>

3675
01:28:23.331 --> 01:28:26.210
<v Speaker 5>and that's why I like the travel experiences are becoming more important to me</v>

3676
01:28:26.211 --> 01:28:27.380
<v Speaker 5>than the actual climate sort of.</v>

3677
01:28:27.770 --> 01:28:28.041
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3678
01:28:28.041 --> 01:28:28.671
<v Speaker 5>I would imagine.</v>

3679
01:28:28.671 --> 01:28:31.040
<v Speaker 5>But that's a really paradigm shifting.</v>

3680
01:28:31.041 --> 01:28:31.181
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3681
01:28:31.181 --> 01:28:32.060
<v Speaker 5>it's pretty heavy stuff.</v>

3682
01:28:32.061 --> 01:28:32.271
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3683
01:28:32.271 --> 01:28:33.104
<v Speaker 5>you're like,</v>

3684
01:28:33.480 --> 01:28:34.313
<v Speaker 5>whoa,</v>

3685
01:28:35.890 --> 01:28:37.250
<v Speaker 5>holy deed man.</v>

3686
01:28:37.310 --> 01:28:40.460
<v Speaker 5>Three days driving on virgin desert,</v>

3687
01:28:41.270 --> 01:28:42.230
<v Speaker 5>nothing to the left,</v>

3688
01:28:42.231 --> 01:28:43.120
<v Speaker 5>nothing to the right.</v>

3689
01:28:43.140 --> 01:28:44.780
<v Speaker 5>Nothing in front of you in the morning.</v>

3690
01:28:44.840 --> 01:28:46.220
<v Speaker 5>So we would drive until we got tired,</v>

3691
01:28:46.221 --> 01:28:46.701
<v Speaker 5>we'd park,</v>

3692
01:28:46.701 --> 01:28:47.361
<v Speaker 5>we'd do dinner,</v>

3693
01:28:47.361 --> 01:28:48.194
<v Speaker 5>we'd go to bed.</v>

3694
01:28:48.350 --> 01:28:50.030
<v Speaker 5>And then in the morning when you got to go take a poop,</v>

3695
01:28:50.780 --> 01:28:53.330
<v Speaker 5>I mean there's no cover in any direction because it's just flat.</v>

3696
01:28:53.360 --> 01:28:56.960
<v Speaker 5>So you'd basically just walk in any direction until everyone else got really</v>

3697
01:28:56.961 --> 01:28:59.330
<v Speaker 5>small and then you would just take a poo and then you just walked back.</v>

3698
01:28:59.830 --> 01:29:00.471
<v Speaker 5>Because there was no,</v>

3699
01:29:00.471 --> 01:29:00.681
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3700
01:29:00.681 --> 01:29:01.081
<v Speaker 5>it's not like,</v>

3701
01:29:01.081 --> 01:29:02.340
<v Speaker 5>oh I'm going to go behind that tree.</v>

3702
01:29:02.370 --> 01:29:03.390
<v Speaker 5>Is that you just have to walk though.</v>

3703
01:29:03.391 --> 01:29:04.190
<v Speaker 5>People are small.</v>

3704
01:29:04.190 --> 01:29:05.340
<v Speaker 5>You take photos of this.</v>

3705
01:29:05.430 --> 01:29:05.671
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3706
01:29:05.671 --> 01:29:06.240
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's all,</v>

3707
01:29:06.240 --> 01:29:06.421
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

3708
01:29:06.421 --> 01:29:07.254
<v Speaker 5>it's all professional.</v>

3709
01:29:07.350 --> 01:29:08.490
<v Speaker 5>I didn't take quite as much,</v>

3710
01:29:08.491 --> 01:29:10.250
<v Speaker 5>but it must've been no your poop.</v>

3711
01:29:10.251 --> 01:29:15.251
<v Speaker 5>Then I have photos of Brian Cowen pooping when we a camping in Montana with a</v>

3712
01:29:16.261 --> 01:29:17.130
<v Speaker 5>little flag in it.</v>

3713
01:29:17.160 --> 01:29:18.390
<v Speaker 5>We were going to put it on Twitter.</v>

3714
01:29:18.600 --> 01:29:19.110
<v Speaker 5>That a,</v>

3715
01:29:19.110 --> 01:29:19.831
<v Speaker 5>if you could find it,</v>

3716
01:29:19.831 --> 01:29:20.910
<v Speaker 5>we'll give you 1000 bucks.</v>

3717
01:29:21.360 --> 01:29:24.810
<v Speaker 5>It's on the Missouri River and we were going to give like rough coordinates.</v>

3718
01:29:25.050 --> 01:29:26.100
<v Speaker 5>Take a picture of yourself by,</v>

3719
01:29:26.101 --> 01:29:27.120
<v Speaker 5>we'll give you 1000 bucks,</v>

3720
01:29:27.150 --> 01:29:29.460
<v Speaker 5>but you can't just sleep poop tear.</v>

3721
01:29:29.470 --> 01:29:31.400
<v Speaker 5>You have to like put it in bio bag,</v>

3722
01:29:31.630 --> 01:29:32.211
<v Speaker 5>back down,</v>

3723
01:29:32.211 --> 01:29:35.460
<v Speaker 5>pack it out and human poop is really gross.</v>

3724
01:29:35.461 --> 01:29:36.840
<v Speaker 5>Like if you run across like cows,</v>

3725
01:29:36.841 --> 01:29:38.160
<v Speaker 5>poop is a lot of cows out there.</v>

3726
01:29:38.430 --> 01:29:38.861
<v Speaker 5>Cow Poop.</v>

3727
01:29:38.861 --> 01:29:39.694
<v Speaker 5>It's kind of gross to,</v>

3728
01:29:39.750 --> 01:29:40.441
<v Speaker 5>it's kind of gross,</v>

3729
01:29:40.441 --> 01:29:45.030
<v Speaker 5>but it doesn't smell that bad difference in human shit and cow shit is pretty</v>

3730
01:29:45.031 --> 01:29:45.660
<v Speaker 5>shocking.</v>

3731
01:29:45.660 --> 01:29:45.960
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3732
01:29:45.960 --> 01:29:50.100
<v Speaker 5>no cow shit also smells horrible until it's been sitting there for like a year</v>

3733
01:29:50.101 --> 01:29:51.210
<v Speaker 5>and it's all baked by the sun.</v>

3734
01:29:51.360 --> 01:29:51.990
<v Speaker 5>That too,</v>

3735
01:29:51.990 --> 01:29:54.920
<v Speaker 5>like what you're talking about is like fried cow pies that are all dead and like</v>

3736
01:29:54.930 --> 01:29:55.571
<v Speaker 5>sterilized,</v>

3737
01:29:55.571 --> 01:29:55.720
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

3738
01:29:55.720 --> 01:29:55.860
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3739
01:29:55.860 --> 01:29:56.611
<v Speaker 5>But I've been around,</v>

3740
01:29:56.611 --> 01:29:59.850
<v Speaker 5>but the actual cow taking a shit and they can't fuck with a human.</v>

3741
01:30:00.270 --> 01:30:00.661
<v Speaker 5>I Dunno.</v>

3742
01:30:00.661 --> 01:30:01.590
<v Speaker 5>But it depends.</v>

3743
01:30:01.600 --> 01:30:02.610
<v Speaker 5>It depends on the,</v>

3744
01:30:02.611 --> 01:30:03.550
<v Speaker 5>depends on burgers.</v>

3745
01:30:03.990 --> 01:30:04.141
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3746
01:30:04.141 --> 01:30:04.591
<v Speaker 5>exactly.</v>

3747
01:30:04.591 --> 01:30:04.941
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3748
01:30:04.941 --> 01:30:09.300
<v Speaker 5>Just shitting out cheeseburgers and whiskey that he just goes to show you guys</v>

3749
01:30:09.301 --> 01:30:10.650

3750
01:30:11.310 --> 01:30:12.210
<v Speaker 5>That's not made.</v>

3751
01:30:12.270 --> 01:30:13.610
<v Speaker 5>I'm saying some other dude,</v>

3752
01:30:13.740 --> 01:30:15.150
<v Speaker 5>it was some random dude just shit.</v>

3753
01:30:15.151 --> 01:30:15.870
<v Speaker 5>And we're grading it.</v>

3754
01:30:15.870 --> 01:30:16.800
<v Speaker 5>That's what you're talking about.</v>

3755
01:30:18.210 --> 01:30:18.631
<v Speaker 5>But uh,</v>

3756
01:30:18.631 --> 01:30:18.901
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

3757
01:30:18.901 --> 01:30:21.810
<v Speaker 5>you can't just leave your shit out there in the Missouri,</v>

3758
01:30:21.930 --> 01:30:22.950
<v Speaker 5>but you can't in the desert.</v>

3759
01:30:24.150 --> 01:30:26.510
<v Speaker 5>Did you encounter any animals while you were doing this?</v>

3760
01:30:26.810 --> 01:30:27.080
<v Speaker 5>Dry?</v>

3761
01:30:27.080 --> 01:30:30.230
<v Speaker 5>We saw tons of little things like little desert foxes and stuff and um,</v>

3762
01:30:30.300 --> 01:30:30.541
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

3763
01:30:30.541 --> 01:30:30.721
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

3764
01:30:30.721 --> 01:30:31.460
<v Speaker 5>cause they'll type,</v>

3765
01:30:31.460 --> 01:30:32.293
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3766
01:30:32.390 --> 01:30:32.611
<v Speaker 5>I don't know,</v>

3767
01:30:32.611 --> 01:30:32.900
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3768
01:30:32.900 --> 01:30:34.510
<v Speaker 5>different antelopes and what are they,</v>

3769
01:30:34.511 --> 01:30:34.650
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3770
01:30:34.650 --> 01:30:35.131
<v Speaker 5>eating out?</v>

3771
01:30:35.131 --> 01:30:36.870
<v Speaker 5>They're like tiny little shrubs.</v>

3772
01:30:36.871 --> 01:30:37.081
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3773
01:30:37.081 --> 01:30:37.914
<v Speaker 5>there were like,</v>

3774
01:30:38.010 --> 01:30:38.221
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3775
01:30:38.221 --> 01:30:40.650
<v Speaker 5>there'd be a Bush every 600 yards,</v>

3776
01:30:40.950 --> 01:30:41.461
<v Speaker 5>you know what I mean?</v>

3777
01:30:41.461 --> 01:30:42.090
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

3778
01:30:42.090 --> 01:30:45.450
<v Speaker 5>I mean there is some vegetation but it's just like flat sand with like a shrub</v>

3779
01:30:45.840 --> 01:30:47.190
<v Speaker 5>and then like a mile later you're like,</v>

3780
01:30:47.191 --> 01:30:48.360
<v Speaker 5>there's a little tiny tree,</v>

3781
01:30:48.570 --> 01:30:48.841
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

3782
01:30:48.841 --> 01:30:49.950
<v Speaker 5>And then whatever,</v>

3783
01:30:50.520 --> 01:30:51.353
<v Speaker 5>no snakes,</v>

3784
01:30:51.360 --> 01:30:52.171
<v Speaker 5>nothing like that.</v>

3785
01:30:52.171 --> 01:30:55.090
<v Speaker 5>That and not really know what a strange ecosystem that is.</v>

3786
01:30:55.470 --> 01:30:56.640
<v Speaker 5>When we got to where we were going,</v>

3787
01:30:56.641 --> 01:31:00.090
<v Speaker 5>there were these amazing stand stone towers and then there was like more whether</v>

3788
01:31:00.091 --> 01:31:03.060
<v Speaker 5>there was more going on I think because of this Phil cliffs and stuff.</v>

3789
01:31:03.060 --> 01:31:05.160
<v Speaker 5>So maybe it traps more moisture or whatever.</v>

3790
01:31:05.161 --> 01:31:05.730
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

3791
01:31:05.730 --> 01:31:08.220
<v Speaker 5>and there were more people living there because there was more vegetation.</v>

3792
01:31:08.760 --> 01:31:09.593
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3793
01:31:09.810 --> 01:31:10.081
<v Speaker 5>you know what,</v>

3794
01:31:10.081 --> 01:31:11.310
<v Speaker 5>I'm still pretty much desert.</v>

3795
01:31:11.311 --> 01:31:11.460
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3796
01:31:11.460 --> 01:31:12.810
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's still full fledged desert,</v>

3797
01:31:12.811 --> 01:31:14.040
<v Speaker 5>but there were at least like shrubs,</v>

3798
01:31:14.050 --> 01:31:15.870
<v Speaker 5>kind of like the American desert where you see,</v>

3799
01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:16.261
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3800
01:31:16.261 --> 01:31:18.000
<v Speaker 5>like the Mojave and how they get their water,</v>

3801
01:31:18.420 --> 01:31:19.530
<v Speaker 5>their wells every once in a while.</v>

3802
01:31:20.910 --> 01:31:21.211
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3803
01:31:21.211 --> 01:31:21.420
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

3804
01:31:21.420 --> 01:31:22.200
<v Speaker 5>I assume,</v>

3805
01:31:22.200 --> 01:31:22.441
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3806
01:31:22.441 --> 01:31:23.880
<v Speaker 5>there was water running underground,</v>

3807
01:31:23.881 --> 01:31:24.181
<v Speaker 5>I guess,</v>

3808
01:31:24.181 --> 01:31:27.150
<v Speaker 5>because you could see like bands of vegetation that we're supposedly like</v>

3809
01:31:27.151 --> 01:31:27.601
<v Speaker 5>washes,</v>

3810
01:31:27.601 --> 01:31:27.811
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3811
01:31:27.811 --> 01:31:28.680
<v Speaker 5>like an underground river.</v>

3812
01:31:28.980 --> 01:31:30.810
<v Speaker 5>So one of the real mind fucks about the,</v>

3813
01:31:30.811 --> 01:31:30.991
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3814
01:31:30.991 --> 01:31:35.250
<v Speaker 5>the topography of this world is how it's variable.</v>

3815
01:31:35.570 --> 01:31:35.970
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3816
01:31:35.970 --> 01:31:36.541
<v Speaker 5>How are you different,</v>

3817
01:31:36.541 --> 01:31:37.331
<v Speaker 5>different parts of the world.</v>

3818
01:31:37.331 --> 01:31:42.331
<v Speaker 5>They're not just variable but variable in the same location over time to Egypt</v>

3819
01:31:43.200 --> 01:31:45.870
<v Speaker 5>where the Nile Valley was like 9,000 years ago.</v>

3820
01:31:45.870 --> 01:31:46.730
<v Speaker 5>That was a rain forest.</v>

3821
01:31:46.810 --> 01:31:47.400
<v Speaker 5>But yeah,</v>

3822
01:31:47.400 --> 01:31:47.790
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>

3823
01:31:47.790 --> 01:31:49.740
<v Speaker 5>that's the exact same type of area that I'm talking about.</v>

3824
01:31:49.800 --> 01:31:50.341
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

3825
01:31:50.341 --> 01:31:51.080
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3826
01:31:51.080 --> 01:31:51.571
<v Speaker 5>and it actually,</v>

3827
01:31:51.571 --> 01:31:52.021
<v Speaker 5>so no,</v>

3828
01:31:52.021 --> 01:31:52.561
<v Speaker 5>while we were there,</v>

3829
01:31:52.561 --> 01:31:53.101
<v Speaker 5>it was rad.</v>

3830
01:31:53.101 --> 01:31:55.440
<v Speaker 5>We went into a cave and the cave paintings and,</v>

3831
01:31:55.441 --> 01:31:56.090
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3832
01:31:56.090 --> 01:31:56.581
<v Speaker 5>and I mean,</v>

3833
01:31:56.581 --> 01:31:57.414
<v Speaker 5>it's all just,</v>

3834
01:31:57.480 --> 01:31:57.691
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3835
01:31:57.691 --> 01:31:58.650
<v Speaker 5>we're in the middle of nowhere.</v>

3836
01:31:58.860 --> 01:32:00.790
<v Speaker 5>And so you could see the stick figure drawings and,</v>

3837
01:32:00.791 --> 01:32:01.330
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3838
01:32:01.330 --> 01:32:03.820
<v Speaker 5>and it showed like these big herder people,</v>

3839
01:32:03.850 --> 01:32:04.151
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3840
01:32:04.151 --> 01:32:06.040
<v Speaker 5>like drawings of dudes like tending their,</v>

3841
01:32:06.220 --> 01:32:06.761
<v Speaker 5>their big,</v>

3842
01:32:06.761 --> 01:32:07.090
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3843
01:32:07.090 --> 01:32:10.660
<v Speaker 5>cows and then them being displaced by the camel people,</v>

3844
01:32:10.661 --> 01:32:12.130
<v Speaker 5>like the people of the desert and all that.</v>

3845
01:32:12.220 --> 01:32:12.431
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

3846
01:32:12.431 --> 01:32:12.730
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3847
01:32:12.730 --> 01:32:14.920
<v Speaker 5>and our outfitter was telling us that was kind of showing the history of the</v>

3848
01:32:14.921 --> 01:32:16.420
<v Speaker 5>whole area because like as the,</v>

3849
01:32:16.450 --> 01:32:19.150
<v Speaker 5>as the desert advanced and like the grasslands and forests,</v>

3850
01:32:19.151 --> 01:32:19.350
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3851
01:32:19.350 --> 01:32:20.350
<v Speaker 5>receded like,</v>

3852
01:32:20.351 --> 01:32:22.000
<v Speaker 5>so Chad now all the,</v>

3853
01:32:22.001 --> 01:32:24.910
<v Speaker 5>all the big cow people now live in like southern southern Chad where they're</v>

3854
01:32:24.911 --> 01:32:27.250
<v Speaker 5>still like vegetation and the rest of the country is just desert,</v>

3855
01:32:27.280 --> 01:32:27.521
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3856
01:32:27.521 --> 01:32:30.430
<v Speaker 5>as the Sahara or whatever this the hell has like moved south and</v>

3857
01:32:30.880 --> 01:32:31.750
<v Speaker 5>desertification,</v>

3858
01:32:31.751 --> 01:32:32.584
<v Speaker 5>all that kind of stuff.</v>

3859
01:32:32.590 --> 01:32:34.840
<v Speaker 5>It's a really strange thing that happens to the climate.</v>

3860
01:32:35.200 --> 01:32:35.411
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3861
01:32:35.411 --> 01:32:36.041
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's pretty,</v>

3862
01:32:36.041 --> 01:32:38.680
<v Speaker 5>it's pretty interesting though to see like cave paintings of like this whole</v>

3863
01:32:38.681 --> 01:32:39.550
<v Speaker 5>process of,</v>

3864
01:32:39.640 --> 01:32:39.941
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3865
01:32:39.941 --> 01:32:41.800
<v Speaker 5>like different populations being,</v>

3866
01:32:42.270 --> 01:32:42.490
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3867
01:32:42.490 --> 01:32:43.270
<v Speaker 5>replaced.</v>

3868
01:32:43.270 --> 01:32:44.710
<v Speaker 5>How many Ken's paintings do they know?</v>

3869
01:32:44.950 --> 01:32:45.161
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3870
01:32:45.161 --> 01:32:45.910
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3871
01:32:45.910 --> 01:32:46.270
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

3872
01:32:46.270 --> 01:32:50.740
<v Speaker 5>I think that the climate events are over the last 10,000 years or whatever or</v>

3873
01:32:50.741 --> 01:32:51.574
<v Speaker 5>maybe even older.</v>

3874
01:32:52.570 --> 01:32:52.990
<v Speaker 5>Wow,</v>

3875
01:32:52.990 --> 01:32:53.770
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>

3876
01:32:53.770 --> 01:32:54.251
<v Speaker 5>It was pretty,</v>

3877
01:32:54.251 --> 01:32:55.510
<v Speaker 5>I mean it was neat stuff for us.</v>

3878
01:32:55.511 --> 01:32:56.030
<v Speaker 5>We were like,</v>

3879
01:32:56.030 --> 01:32:56.863
<v Speaker 3>whoa.</v>

3880
01:32:56.960 --> 01:32:57.793
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3881
01:32:58.200 --> 01:33:00.440
<v Speaker 3>it's really the key cave paintings really freaked me out.</v>

3882
01:33:00.470 --> 01:33:01.221
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever seen that?</v>

3883
01:33:01.221 --> 01:33:03.260
<v Speaker 3>A Herzog documentary on a,</v>

3884
01:33:03.290 --> 01:33:03.891
<v Speaker 3>what's it called?</v>

3885
01:33:03.891 --> 01:33:05.960
<v Speaker 3>The cave of dreams or something like that.</v>

3886
01:33:06.530 --> 01:33:07.120
<v Speaker 3>Hold on,</v>

3887
01:33:07.120 --> 01:33:11.060
<v Speaker 3>let me find that for the folks who are listening because it's a really</v>

3888
01:33:11.061 --> 01:33:11.630
<v Speaker 3>interesting,</v>

3889
01:33:11.630 --> 01:33:16.630
<v Speaker 3>they found some really old cave paintings that predated what the,</v>

3890
01:33:17.751 --> 01:33:19.280
<v Speaker 3>like the most,</v>

3891
01:33:19.370 --> 01:33:19.551
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

3892
01:33:19.551 --> 01:33:22.340
<v Speaker 3>the oldest before that by like a pretty substantial amount.</v>

3893
01:33:25.180 --> 01:33:26.370
<v Speaker 9>Find a real quick</v>

3894
01:33:26.520 --> 01:33:27.750
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3895
01:33:29.280 --> 01:33:29.700
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

3896
01:33:29.700 --> 01:33:31.560
<v Speaker 3>Cave of forgotten dreams.</v>

3897
01:33:31.920 --> 01:33:32.790
<v Speaker 3>That's what it's called.</v>

3898
01:33:32.820 --> 01:33:33.690
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing.</v>

3899
01:33:34.730 --> 01:33:35.640
<v Speaker 3>It's in France.</v>

3900
01:33:35.830 --> 01:33:36.570
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

3901
01:33:36.570 --> 01:33:36.810
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3902
01:33:36.810 --> 01:33:38.970
<v Speaker 3>It's the oldest recorded cave paintings,</v>

3903
01:33:39.330 --> 01:33:40.410
<v Speaker 3>human or neanderthal.</v>

3904
01:33:41.070 --> 01:33:41.790
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

3905
01:33:41.790 --> 01:33:42.391
<v Speaker 3>it's human.</v>

3906
01:33:42.391 --> 01:33:44.730
<v Speaker 3>I don't believe there's neanderthal cave paintings.</v>

3907
01:33:45.120 --> 01:33:48.690
<v Speaker 3>I think we know that they made tools and if you heard of this crazy bitch,</v>

3908
01:33:49.140 --> 01:33:49.411
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

3909
01:33:49.411 --> 01:33:49.711
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

3910
01:33:49.711 --> 01:33:51.890
<v Speaker 3>there's a guy who wants to bring back.</v>

3911
01:33:52.230 --> 01:33:52.381
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

3912
01:33:52.381 --> 01:33:53.640
<v Speaker 5>I just had just awesome.</v>

3913
01:33:53.641 --> 01:33:54.500
<v Speaker 5>I was thinking about that.</v>

3914
01:33:54.501 --> 01:33:54.760
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3915
01:33:54.760 --> 01:33:55.170
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

3916
01:33:55.170 --> 01:33:55.561
<v Speaker 5>totally.</v>

3917
01:33:55.561 --> 01:33:55.981
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

3918
01:33:55.981 --> 01:33:57.230
<v Speaker 5>that seems like an opening.</v>

3919
01:33:57.250 --> 01:33:59.160
<v Speaker 5>A bag of worms versus your yeah,</v>

3920
01:33:59.220 --> 01:33:59.770
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

3921
01:33:59.770 --> 01:34:00.180
<v Speaker 3>They're going to,</v>

3922
01:34:00.180 --> 01:34:01.013
<v Speaker 3>they're asking for,</v>

3923
01:34:01.210 --> 01:34:02.380
<v Speaker 3>it's some Harvard Guy,</v>

3924
01:34:02.381 --> 01:34:03.030
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3925
01:34:03.030 --> 01:34:03.970
<v Speaker 3>The inner tall baby.</v>

3926
01:34:05.810 --> 01:34:06.270
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>

3927
01:34:06.270 --> 01:34:07.910
<v Speaker 3>some guys asking a woman to,</v>

3928
01:34:07.911 --> 01:34:08.300
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3929
01:34:08.300 --> 01:34:10.430
<v Speaker 3>to carry or carry a fucking neanderthal baby.</v>

3930
01:34:10.750 --> 01:34:11.210
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3931
01:34:11.210 --> 01:34:15.260
<v Speaker 3>I have no idea why anyone has letting this guy say this.</v>

3932
01:34:15.910 --> 01:34:17.970
<v Speaker 3>Well because nothing wrong with saying it.</v>

3933
01:34:18.440 --> 01:34:19.400
<v Speaker 3>Your problem with doing it,</v>

3934
01:34:19.520 --> 01:34:21.080
<v Speaker 3>it sounds fucking crazy.</v>

3935
01:34:21.081 --> 01:34:21.860
<v Speaker 3>But this guys,</v>

3936
01:34:21.860 --> 01:34:24.650
<v Speaker 3>his name is George Church and he's from Harvard.</v>

3937
01:34:24.651 --> 01:34:25.520
<v Speaker 3>This is legit.</v>

3938
01:34:25.580 --> 01:34:26.960
<v Speaker 3>This is not like some,</v>

3939
01:34:27.200 --> 01:34:28.033
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

3940
01:34:29.550 --> 01:34:29.950
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3941
01:34:29.950 --> 01:34:30.880
<v Speaker 3>Well the,</v>

3942
01:34:30.920 --> 01:34:31.110
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

3943
01:34:31.110 --> 01:34:33.050
<v Speaker 3>the really scary thing is that we don't need,</v>

3944
01:34:33.080 --> 01:34:34.820
<v Speaker 3>we don't know shit about neanderthals.</v>

3945
01:34:35.200 --> 01:34:35.780
<v Speaker 3>We have no,</v>

3946
01:34:35.780 --> 01:34:35.970
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

3947
01:34:35.970 --> 01:34:39.560
<v Speaker 3>they're built more like gorillas in the RP people and their brains when they</v>

3948
01:34:39.620 --> 01:34:40.490
<v Speaker 3>built more like realism.</v>

3949
01:34:40.491 --> 01:34:41.300
<v Speaker 3>There are people,</v>

3950
01:34:41.300 --> 01:34:42.380
<v Speaker 3>five foot tall,</v>

3951
01:34:42.500 --> 01:34:43.460
<v Speaker 3>200 pounds,</v>

3952
01:34:43.610 --> 01:34:44.870
<v Speaker 3>really sick bones,</v>

3953
01:34:45.110 --> 01:34:45.861
<v Speaker 3>big head's,</v>

3954
01:34:45.861 --> 01:34:47.090
<v Speaker 3>bigger heads in human beings,</v>

3955
01:34:47.091 --> 01:34:48.760
<v Speaker 3>much larger brain zoo.</v>

3956
01:34:48.780 --> 01:34:50.000
<v Speaker 3>It's a really trippy thing.</v>

3957
01:34:50.001 --> 01:34:53.900
<v Speaker 3>The idea that this crazy fuck wants to bring these things back and that the fact</v>

3958
01:34:53.901 --> 01:34:55.760
<v Speaker 3>that you could do it inside of a woman's body,</v>

3959
01:34:56.180 --> 01:34:57.140
<v Speaker 3>it's pretty ridiculous.</v>

3960
01:34:58.880 --> 01:34:59.840
<v Speaker 3>Crazy asshole.</v>

3961
01:34:59.930 --> 01:35:00.141
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

3962
01:35:00.141 --> 01:35:00.530
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3963
01:35:00.530 --> 01:35:01.011
<v Speaker 3>so no,</v>

3964
01:35:01.011 --> 01:35:04.400
<v Speaker 3>I don't believe that this a Werner Herzog thing was that I'm pretty sure that it</v>

3965
01:35:04.401 --> 01:35:04.881
<v Speaker 3>was a,</v>

3966
01:35:04.881 --> 01:35:05.714
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3967
01:35:05.870 --> 01:35:06.531
<v Speaker 3>it's all,</v>

3968
01:35:06.531 --> 01:35:07.130
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3969
01:35:07.130 --> 01:35:09.680
<v Speaker 3>it's all homosapiens at the first one's a female.</v>

3970
01:35:10.580 --> 01:35:12.350
<v Speaker 3>The first baby.</v>

3971
01:35:13.810 --> 01:35:14.090
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3972
01:35:14.090 --> 01:35:14.481
<v Speaker 3>Better.</v>

3973
01:35:14.481 --> 01:35:14.810
<v Speaker 3>Better.</v>

3974
01:35:14.810 --> 01:35:15.501
<v Speaker 3>Because if it's a man,</v>

3975
01:35:15.501 --> 01:35:16.760
<v Speaker 3>it's just going to start raping.</v>

3976
01:35:17.130 --> 01:35:18.230
<v Speaker 3>Just kind of go on a rape,</v>

3977
01:35:18.440 --> 01:35:21.440
<v Speaker 3>rape and cannibal rampage when it gets to full grown,</v>

3978
01:35:21.770 --> 01:35:22.011
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3979
01:35:22.011 --> 01:35:22.401
<v Speaker 3>who knows.</v>

3980
01:35:22.401 --> 01:35:25.640
<v Speaker 3>We don't know the behavior of a neanderthals because it's been a lot of</v>

3981
01:35:25.641 --> 01:35:27.680
<v Speaker 3>speculation that neanderthals preyed on the units.</v>

3982
01:35:27.740 --> 01:35:29.390
<v Speaker 3>They might take bids to the next level.</v>

3983
01:35:29.780 --> 01:35:32.900
<v Speaker 3>Well if I was praying on humans obviously didn't pray enough cause they got</v>

3984
01:35:32.901 --> 01:35:33.261
<v Speaker 3>wiped out,</v>

3985
01:35:33.261 --> 01:35:34.420
<v Speaker 3>but he might have been wine.</v>

3986
01:35:34.421 --> 01:35:35.254
<v Speaker 3>We wiped him out.</v>

3987
01:35:35.630 --> 01:35:35.841
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3988
01:35:35.841 --> 01:35:37.010
<v Speaker 3>we were just a little bit smarter.</v>

3989
01:35:37.130 --> 01:35:37.451
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>

3990
01:35:37.451 --> 01:35:39.650
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of speculation as to what happened to them.</v>

3991
01:35:39.930 --> 01:35:40.220
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3992
01:35:40.220 --> 01:35:43.640
<v Speaker 3>there's also debate as to whether or not they interpret it with us or whether or</v>

3993
01:35:43.641 --> 01:35:45.170
<v Speaker 3>not we have a common ancestor.</v>

3994
01:35:45.171 --> 01:35:49.280
<v Speaker 3>Like where we are genetic material where we definitely have a common ancestor.</v>

3995
01:35:49.281 --> 01:35:49.550
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3996
01:35:49.550 --> 01:35:49.851
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3997
01:35:49.851 --> 01:35:53.420
<v Speaker 3>we definitely have a common ancestor but common enough that we have in the inner</v>

3998
01:35:53.421 --> 01:35:54.380
<v Speaker 3>tall genes in us,</v>

3999
01:35:55.100 --> 01:35:55.341
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4000
01:35:55.341 --> 01:35:57.020
<v Speaker 3>cause they don't know if it's from breeding.</v>

4001
01:35:57.050 --> 01:35:57.380
<v Speaker 3>This is like,</v>

4002
01:35:57.380 --> 01:35:59.120
<v Speaker 3>it's like kind of a iffy area.</v>

4003
01:35:59.121 --> 01:36:02.000
<v Speaker 3>They're trying to piece together now whether or not it's from humans breeding</v>

4004
01:36:02.001 --> 01:36:02.390
<v Speaker 3>with it,</v>

4005
01:36:02.390 --> 01:36:04.550
<v Speaker 3>but interesting enough the pop,</v>

4006
01:36:04.580 --> 01:36:09.580
<v Speaker 3>the possibility of humans breeding with it was only neanderthal males and human</v>

4007
01:36:10.011 --> 01:36:10.770
<v Speaker 3>females.</v>

4008
01:36:10.770 --> 01:36:11.540
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

4009
01:36:11.540 --> 01:36:12.110
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

4010
01:36:12.110 --> 01:36:13.960
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a scientific reason for the,</v>

4011
01:36:13.961 --> 01:36:15.530
<v Speaker 3>the the hybrid to be able to,</v>

4012
01:36:15.860 --> 01:36:17.960
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of weird because it seems like you'd want it,</v>

4013
01:36:17.961 --> 01:36:20.570
<v Speaker 3>the neanderthal women to be able to carry like the bigger baby.</v>

4014
01:36:20.930 --> 01:36:21.251
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4015
01:36:21.251 --> 01:36:23.400
<v Speaker 3>I think because like I say,</v>

4016
01:36:23.401 --> 01:36:25.020
<v Speaker 3>being a woman and got torn apart by,</v>

4017
01:36:25.220 --> 01:36:26.840
<v Speaker 3>I think they're just saying it was rape.</v>

4018
01:36:27.110 --> 01:36:28.040
<v Speaker 3>I think that's what I was saying.</v>

4019
01:36:28.220 --> 01:36:29.720
<v Speaker 3>I think that was saying it was a,</v>

4020
01:36:29.840 --> 01:36:30.111
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4021
01:36:30.111 --> 01:36:30.944
<v Speaker 3>a conquer thing.</v>

4022
01:36:31.130 --> 01:36:34.290
<v Speaker 3>Cause there's also speculation as to whether or not neanderthals eight</v>

4023
01:36:34.460 --> 01:36:35.293
<v Speaker 3>homosapiens.</v>

4024
01:36:36.350 --> 01:36:36.860
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>

4025
01:36:36.860 --> 01:36:40.430
<v Speaker 3>That's the weirdest thing that I would have been aware of recently that I didn't</v>

4026
01:36:40.431 --> 01:36:42.950
<v Speaker 3>know about was how often native Americans,</v>

4027
01:36:43.520 --> 01:36:44.170
<v Speaker 3>other,</v>

4028
01:36:44.170 --> 01:36:45.003
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

4029
01:36:45.140 --> 01:36:48.320
<v Speaker 3>Eight each other in Papa New Guinea or stone under that kind of thing.</v>

4030
01:36:49.070 --> 01:36:49.903
<v Speaker 3>Are they really,</v>

4031
01:36:50.620 --> 01:36:52.670
<v Speaker 3>they're still in the cannibalism sort of,</v>

4032
01:36:53.480 --> 01:36:55.250
<v Speaker 3>they're all sending to a lot of other freaky shit.</v>

4033
01:36:55.251 --> 01:36:58.690
<v Speaker 3>Like they're into having the young boys in just their semen.</v>

4034
01:37:00.130 --> 01:37:01.760
<v Speaker 3>The semen tribes have,</v>

4035
01:37:01.780 --> 01:37:03.580
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people in the states are starting to that.</v>

4036
01:37:04.790 --> 01:37:06.170
<v Speaker 3>They're called that Catholic priests.</v>

4037
01:37:07.670 --> 01:37:09.380
<v Speaker 3>This is a very different though.</v>

4038
01:37:09.380 --> 01:37:11.600
<v Speaker 3>This is like ritualized and open.</v>

4039
01:37:12.110 --> 01:37:13.760
<v Speaker 3>Whereas the Catholic priests thing is,</v>

4040
01:37:13.970 --> 01:37:14.710
<v Speaker 3>is uh,</v>

4041
01:37:14.710 --> 01:37:15.170
<v Speaker 3>in the,</v>

4042
01:37:15.170 --> 01:37:16.580
<v Speaker 3>in the confessional booth.</v>

4043
01:37:16.730 --> 01:37:17.121
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4044
01:37:17.121 --> 01:37:18.500
<v Speaker 3>It's a little more scratch yours,</v>

4045
01:37:18.750 --> 01:37:19.790
<v Speaker 3>a little more sketch.</v>

4046
01:37:20.140 --> 01:37:20.691
<v Speaker 3>So these,</v>

4047
01:37:20.691 --> 01:37:21.170
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

4048
01:37:21.170 --> 01:37:24.800
<v Speaker 3>these paintings in the Werner Herzog documentary,</v>

4049
01:37:24.801 --> 01:37:27.950
<v Speaker 3>amazing stuff and their cave bears,</v>

4050
01:37:27.951 --> 01:37:28.551
<v Speaker 3>lions,</v>

4051
01:37:28.551 --> 01:37:29.151
<v Speaker 3>horses,</v>

4052
01:37:29.151 --> 01:37:29.810
<v Speaker 3>Bison,</v>

4053
01:37:29.810 --> 01:37:31.330
<v Speaker 3>Mamis Rhinoceros is,</v>

4054
01:37:31.610 --> 01:37:36.610
<v Speaker 3>and there are other animals between 30 and 32,000 year old drawings.</v>

4055
01:37:37.940 --> 01:37:38.930
<v Speaker 3>It's really amazing,</v>

4056
01:37:38.931 --> 01:37:39.764
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

4057
01:37:40.250 --> 01:37:43.700
<v Speaker 3>Just think we managed to wipe out all these different animals in the last 30,000</v>

4058
01:37:43.701 --> 01:37:44.150
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>

4059
01:37:44.150 --> 01:37:44.540
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4060
01:37:44.540 --> 01:37:46.370
<v Speaker 3>they don't believe that people had a,</v>

4061
01:37:46.371 --> 01:37:48.680
<v Speaker 3>a play and wiping out the woolly mammoth.</v>

4062
01:37:48.681 --> 01:37:48.921
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>

4063
01:37:48.921 --> 01:37:49.310
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

4064
01:37:49.310 --> 01:37:50.330
<v Speaker 3>there's thoughts about it.</v>

4065
01:37:50.331 --> 01:37:54.200
<v Speaker 3>But one of the more interesting thoughts about the mammoth because the mammoth</v>

4066
01:37:54.201 --> 01:37:59.201
<v Speaker 3>extinction coincides with what they are pretty sure now was significant meteor.</v>

4067
01:38:00.300 --> 01:38:04.920
<v Speaker 3>Meteor impacts meteor showers somewhere around 12 13,000 years ago.</v>

4068
01:38:05.310 --> 01:38:06.470
<v Speaker 3>When they do the strata,</v>

4069
01:38:06.520 --> 01:38:08.100
<v Speaker 3>when they take soil samples,</v>

4070
01:38:08.310 --> 01:38:10.770
<v Speaker 3>they've found this thing called a,</v>

4071
01:38:10.780 --> 01:38:11.461
<v Speaker 3>it's like a,</v>

4072
01:38:11.461 --> 01:38:14.010
<v Speaker 3>a volcanic glass and impact glass.</v>

4073
01:38:14.020 --> 01:38:15.570
<v Speaker 3>It's big fit.</v>

4074
01:38:15.630 --> 01:38:20.630
<v Speaker 3>It's like it's green looking glass that has come from either nuclear tests or</v>

4075
01:38:21.030 --> 01:38:22.140
<v Speaker 3>meteor impacts.</v>

4076
01:38:22.350 --> 01:38:25.890
<v Speaker 3>So when they find it all over the world like 12,000 years ago and that sort of</v>

4077
01:38:25.891 --> 01:38:27.780
<v Speaker 3>coincides with some mass extinctions.</v>

4078
01:38:28.140 --> 01:38:31.240
<v Speaker 3>A lot of the scientists are starting to speculate that that might've been what</v>

4079
01:38:31.241 --> 01:38:32.430
<v Speaker 3>wiped out a lot of things,</v>

4080
01:38:32.431 --> 01:38:36.810
<v Speaker 3>including a lot of like major civilizations that the world just got bombarded by</v>

4081
01:38:36.811 --> 01:38:38.100
<v Speaker 3>meteors at one point in time,</v>

4082
01:38:38.160 --> 01:38:39.780
<v Speaker 3>but somewhere around 12,000 years ago.</v>

4083
01:38:40.020 --> 01:38:40.500
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>

4084
01:38:40.500 --> 01:38:40.681
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4085
01:38:40.681 --> 01:38:41.041
<v Speaker 3>it's pretty,</v>

4086
01:38:41.041 --> 01:38:41.910
<v Speaker 3>pretty crazy stuff.</v>

4087
01:38:42.090 --> 01:38:46.950
<v Speaker 3>They think that might've had a part in the saber tooth tiger and a wooly mammoth</v>

4088
01:38:47.310 --> 01:38:47.880
<v Speaker 3>and that uh,</v>

4089
01:38:47.880 --> 01:38:48.990
<v Speaker 3>some animals just weren't,</v>

4090
01:38:48.991 --> 01:38:49.380
<v Speaker 3>be able to make.</v>

4091
01:38:49.380 --> 01:38:50.940
<v Speaker 3>That was another animal that trying to bring back.</v>

4092
01:38:51.120 --> 01:38:52.620
<v Speaker 3>They're trying to bring back a wooly mammoth.</v>

4093
01:38:52.870 --> 01:38:54.600
<v Speaker 3>The Russian scientists trying to do that.</v>

4094
01:38:55.350 --> 01:38:56.430
<v Speaker 3>They need bigger carpets.</v>

4095
01:38:56.760 --> 01:38:57.110
<v Speaker 3>What,</v>

4096
01:38:57.110 --> 01:38:59.700
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck is with people wanting to bring things back?</v>

4097
01:38:59.730 --> 01:39:01.530
<v Speaker 3>Like you know enough already.</v>

4098
01:39:01.680 --> 01:39:03.030
<v Speaker 3>How about some of them make an alien,</v>

4099
01:39:03.510 --> 01:39:03.901
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4100
01:39:03.901 --> 01:39:05.580
<v Speaker 3>why is everybody bringing old shit back?</v>

4101
01:39:05.850 --> 01:39:06.240
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4102
01:39:06.240 --> 01:39:07.140
<v Speaker 5>they probably are doing that.</v>

4103
01:39:07.141 --> 01:39:08.100
<v Speaker 5>They're just not telling us.</v>

4104
01:39:10.260 --> 01:39:13.440
<v Speaker 5>Maybe now you're out there camp and you ever see something freaky ever hear a</v>

4105
01:39:13.450 --> 01:39:13.951
<v Speaker 5>big foot,</v>

4106
01:39:13.951 --> 01:39:14.880
<v Speaker 5>ever see a Ufo?</v>

4107
01:39:15.060 --> 01:39:15.780
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

4108
01:39:15.780 --> 01:39:16.141
<v Speaker 5>nothing.</v>

4109
01:39:16.141 --> 01:39:17.250
<v Speaker 5>I don't really do the weird stuff.</v>

4110
01:39:19.080 --> 01:39:22.290
<v Speaker 5>You don't really do the weird stuff like not into all the like weird,</v>

4111
01:39:22.291 --> 01:39:23.190
<v Speaker 5>random stuff like that.</v>

4112
01:39:23.400 --> 01:39:24.810
<v Speaker 5>I'm a very practical kind of guy.</v>

4113
01:39:25.440 --> 01:39:26.610
<v Speaker 5>You very practical.</v>

4114
01:39:26.640 --> 01:39:28.770
<v Speaker 5>Crazy mountain climber dude.</v>

4115
01:39:29.190 --> 01:39:29.371
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4116
01:39:29.371 --> 01:39:30.204
<v Speaker 5>Very rational.</v>

4117
01:39:30.540 --> 01:39:31.140
<v Speaker 5>Rational.</v>

4118
01:39:31.140 --> 01:39:31.890
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

4119
01:39:31.890 --> 01:39:33.120
<v Speaker 5>you know by,</v>

4120
01:39:33.121 --> 01:39:33.660
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

4121
01:39:33.660 --> 01:39:38.520
<v Speaker 5>by Ufos being irrational and the same just because you haven't seen something</v>

4122
01:39:38.521 --> 01:39:39.390
<v Speaker 5>that's irrational,</v>

4123
01:39:39.960 --> 01:39:40.321
<v Speaker 5>would you,</v>

4124
01:39:40.321 --> 01:39:43.410
<v Speaker 5>would you freak out if you're out there camping and all of sudden if an alien</v>

4125
01:39:43.411 --> 01:39:45.480
<v Speaker 5>landed Ufo flew overhead,</v>

4126
01:39:45.510 --> 01:39:46.410
<v Speaker 5>probably wouldn't freak out.</v>

4127
01:39:46.411 --> 01:39:46.700
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

4128
01:39:46.700 --> 01:39:47.491
<v Speaker 5>but I'd be like that.</v>

4129
01:39:47.491 --> 01:39:48.540
<v Speaker 5>It's bad ass.</v>

4130
01:39:48.600 --> 01:39:53.040
<v Speaker 5>Do you think you'd still keep climbing or would you like changed the subject and</v>

4131
01:39:53.041 --> 01:39:53.950
<v Speaker 5>start trying to,</v>

4132
01:39:54.280 --> 01:39:56.750
<v Speaker 5>trying to take time out to chat with the alien or not?</v>

4133
01:39:57.590 --> 01:39:58.423
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

4134
01:39:59.080 --> 01:40:00.270
<v Speaker 5>that's a good question actually.</v>

4135
01:40:00.600 --> 01:40:03.510
<v Speaker 5>I mean for sure if I had some kind of crazy experience like that where I was</v>

4136
01:40:03.511 --> 01:40:03.840
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

4137
01:40:03.840 --> 01:40:05.740
<v Speaker 5>I am 100% certain in their life,</v>

4138
01:40:05.741 --> 01:40:06.360
<v Speaker 5>in other planets,</v>

4139
01:40:06.360 --> 01:40:09.330
<v Speaker 5>like I probably would change my field a bit because all of a sudden I'd be like,</v>

4140
01:40:09.331 --> 01:40:12.150
<v Speaker 5>there's definitely something like more important going on in the world.</v>

4141
01:40:12.550 --> 01:40:14.100
<v Speaker 5>The real problem with,</v>

4142
01:40:14.101 --> 01:40:14.730
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

4143
01:40:14.730 --> 01:40:15.360
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

4144
01:40:15.360 --> 01:40:18.480
<v Speaker 5>of course with the idea that there's some life from another planet that's</v>

4145
01:40:18.481 --> 01:40:19.051
<v Speaker 5>visiting us,</v>

4146
01:40:19.051 --> 01:40:20.310
<v Speaker 5>it's like where the fuck's the evidence.</v>

4147
01:40:20.340 --> 01:40:20.970
<v Speaker 5>That's the real,</v>

4148
01:40:20.970 --> 01:40:22.170
<v Speaker 5>that's what I'm saying about rational.</v>

4149
01:40:22.180 --> 01:40:23.100
<v Speaker 5>That's however,</v>

4150
01:40:23.890 --> 01:40:27.490
<v Speaker 3>if they're much more sophisticated than us to the point where they can travel</v>

4151
01:40:27.491 --> 01:40:28.300
<v Speaker 3>from other planets,</v>

4152
01:40:28.300 --> 01:40:30.130
<v Speaker 3>it seems like they could be undetectable.</v>

4153
01:40:30.190 --> 01:40:31.630
<v Speaker 5>That's the same kind of arguments for,</v>

4154
01:40:31.660 --> 01:40:31.901
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4155
01:40:31.901 --> 01:40:32.940
<v Speaker 5>whether there's a god or not,</v>

4156
01:40:32.950 --> 01:40:33.730
<v Speaker 5>it's like whatever.</v>

4157
01:40:33.730 --> 01:40:36.340
<v Speaker 5>Not really because the,</v>

4158
01:40:36.430 --> 01:40:41.050
<v Speaker 3>the actual fact of human life and the fact that we have technological</v>

4159
01:40:41.051 --> 01:40:42.850
<v Speaker 3>superiority over all the animals.</v>

4160
01:40:43.840 --> 01:40:47.230
<v Speaker 3>When you look at all the other planets and you extrapolate the amount of time</v>

4161
01:40:47.231 --> 01:40:48.400
<v Speaker 3>that they could have existed,</v>

4162
01:40:48.430 --> 01:40:49.930
<v Speaker 3>it's highly possible.</v>

4163
01:40:50.180 --> 01:40:50.361
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4164
01:40:50.361 --> 01:40:50.541
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

4165
01:40:50.541 --> 01:40:54.130
<v Speaker 5>I think it's highly likely that there is in the universe.</v>

4166
01:40:54.520 --> 01:40:55.390
<v Speaker 3>I mean actually I think,</v>

4167
01:40:55.420 --> 01:40:56.040
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure there's,</v>

4168
01:40:56.040 --> 01:40:57.550
<v Speaker 3>I don't think any of us in the universe,</v>

4169
01:40:57.790 --> 01:40:57.970
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

4170
01:40:57.970 --> 01:40:59.320
<v Speaker 3>just don't think they're like messing around here.</v>

4171
01:40:59.650 --> 01:41:03.400
<v Speaker 3>But I see that and I agree with you to a certain extent,</v>

4172
01:41:03.520 --> 01:41:08.410
<v Speaker 3>but then I see the fact that there's so many fucking planets and we are</v>

4173
01:41:08.411 --> 01:41:10.450
<v Speaker 3>constantly trying to explore these planets.</v>

4174
01:41:10.480 --> 01:41:11.920
<v Speaker 3>We're sending things to Mars,</v>

4175
01:41:11.921 --> 01:41:12.191
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>

4176
01:41:12.191 --> 01:41:17.191
<v Speaker 3>we're looking with satellites and when with telescopes and trying to observe</v>

4177
01:41:17.350 --> 01:41:18.131
<v Speaker 3>over time really,</v>

4178
01:41:18.131 --> 01:41:19.060
<v Speaker 3>really far apart.</v>

4179
01:41:20.050 --> 01:41:20.620
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

4180
01:41:20.620 --> 01:41:25.270
<v Speaker 3>My point is if we're constantly exploring the universe as far as we can with our</v>

4181
01:41:25.600 --> 01:41:29.980
<v Speaker 3>limited technological capability in 2013 maybe that's just an aspect of</v>

4182
01:41:29.981 --> 01:41:31.090
<v Speaker 3>intelligent life period.</v>

4183
01:41:31.091 --> 01:41:33.430
<v Speaker 3>That intelligent life constantly explores its dimensions.</v>

4184
01:41:34.230 --> 01:41:37.690
<v Speaker 3>Like maybe other really intelligent life explore spiritually area.</v>

4185
01:41:37.691 --> 01:41:38.510
<v Speaker 3>They go inward.</v>

4186
01:41:38.510 --> 01:41:38.921
<v Speaker 3>They just,</v>

4187
01:41:38.921 --> 01:41:39.280
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4188
01:41:39.280 --> 01:41:40.030
<v Speaker 3>that's good point.</v>

4189
01:41:40.030 --> 01:41:40.863
<v Speaker 3>Or both.</v>

4190
01:41:41.390 --> 01:41:42.100
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

4191
01:41:42.100 --> 01:41:45.430
<v Speaker 3>I just feel like part of intelligence is being curious.</v>

4192
01:41:45.430 --> 01:41:47.500
<v Speaker 3>Part of being curious is wondering if you're alone.</v>

4193
01:41:47.530 --> 01:41:50.170
<v Speaker 3>Part of being curious and wondering if you're alone is looking.</v>

4194
01:41:50.950 --> 01:41:52.210
<v Speaker 3>So if I was a smart,</v>

4195
01:41:52.211 --> 01:41:52.900
<v Speaker 3>curious,</v>

4196
01:41:52.900 --> 01:41:54.460
<v Speaker 3>intelligent thing from another planet,</v>

4197
01:41:54.490 --> 01:41:56.740
<v Speaker 3>I think I'd go check out the space.</v>

4198
01:41:56.770 --> 01:41:57.360
<v Speaker 3>The university.</v>

4199
01:41:57.360 --> 01:41:58.660
<v Speaker 3>Hopefully when the aliens come,</v>

4200
01:41:58.670 --> 01:41:59.730
<v Speaker 3>they'll meet you there.</v>

4201
01:41:59.770 --> 01:42:00.461
<v Speaker 3>They're going to come to you,</v>

4202
01:42:00.461 --> 01:42:00.960
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

4203
01:42:00.960 --> 01:42:02.590
<v Speaker 3>you're going to be out there camping and they got to go.</v>

4204
01:42:02.591 --> 01:42:04.720
<v Speaker 3>How come you're not shitting your pants while you're climbing up that thing?</v>

4205
01:42:05.020 --> 01:42:05.920
<v Speaker 3>What are you doing up here?</v>

4206
01:42:06.410 --> 01:42:07.420
<v Speaker 3>Sleeping on a ledge.</v>

4207
01:42:07.720 --> 01:42:09.220
<v Speaker 3>50,000 feet above the earth.</v>

4208
01:42:09.430 --> 01:42:10.930
<v Speaker 3>50,000 that's a big mountain.</v>

4209
01:42:11.080 --> 01:42:12.400
<v Speaker 3>What is the biggest one you've ever climbed?</v>

4210
01:42:12.470 --> 01:42:13.011
<v Speaker 3>What is the,</v>

4211
01:42:13.011 --> 01:42:13.990
<v Speaker 3>the biggest face?</v>

4212
01:42:14.080 --> 01:42:15.730
<v Speaker 3>Biggest faces is like 300 feet.</v>

4213
01:42:15.731 --> 01:42:16.060
<v Speaker 3>Probate.</v>

4214
01:42:16.060 --> 01:42:16.721
<v Speaker 3>Zach appetite.</v>

4215
01:42:16.721 --> 01:42:18.370
<v Speaker 3>And then you send money in Yosemite?</v>

4216
01:42:18.580 --> 01:42:18.791
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4217
01:42:18.791 --> 01:42:19.300
<v Speaker 3>I think so.</v>

4218
01:42:19.300 --> 01:42:20.920
<v Speaker 3>And what's the legality for that stuff?</v>

4219
01:42:20.950 --> 01:42:21.880
<v Speaker 3>Did they totally fine?</v>

4220
01:42:22.030 --> 01:42:23.800
<v Speaker 3>Nobody hassles you about climbing these things?</v>

4221
01:42:24.070 --> 01:42:24.671
<v Speaker 3>National Park.</v>

4222
01:42:24.671 --> 01:42:25.504
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's just,</v>

4223
01:42:25.690 --> 01:42:25.991
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4224
01:42:25.991 --> 01:42:26.560
<v Speaker 3>recreation,</v>

4225
01:42:26.560 --> 01:42:27.011
<v Speaker 3>youth group,</v>

4226
01:42:27.011 --> 01:42:27.640
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

4227
01:42:27.640 --> 01:42:28.473
<v Speaker 3>You just go fine.</v>

4228
01:42:29.300 --> 01:42:33.700
<v Speaker 3>Does there ever been any talk of regulating it or keeping people from solo</v>

4229
01:42:33.701 --> 01:42:34.780
<v Speaker 3>climbing or anything like that?</v>

4230
01:42:34.820 --> 01:42:35.070
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

4231
01:42:35.070 --> 01:42:35.490
<v Speaker 3>No?</v>

4232
01:42:35.490 --> 01:42:36.323
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

4233
01:42:36.740 --> 01:42:36.971
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4234
01:42:36.971 --> 01:42:37.661
<v Speaker 3>how would you regulate?</v>

4235
01:42:37.661 --> 01:42:38.350
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4236
01:42:38.350 --> 01:42:38.590
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4237
01:42:38.590 --> 01:42:41.320
<v Speaker 3>then you might as well be regulating like fat people hiking,</v>

4238
01:42:41.380 --> 01:42:41.681
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4239
01:42:41.681 --> 01:42:43.600
<v Speaker 3>because they're more likely to have a heart attack or whatever.</v>

4240
01:42:43.810 --> 01:42:44.140
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4241
01:42:44.140 --> 01:42:45.190
<v Speaker 3>that's the good point though.</v>

4242
01:42:45.191 --> 01:42:48.170
<v Speaker 3>The good point is personal freedom.</v>

4243
01:42:48.240 --> 01:42:50.710
<v Speaker 3>They definitely should be someone to talk them into it though.</v>

4244
01:42:50.800 --> 01:42:52.060
<v Speaker 3>I don't think we should put a gun to their head.</v>

4245
01:42:52.370 --> 01:42:53.203
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

4246
01:42:53.620 --> 01:42:55.060
<v Speaker 3>the personal freedom aspect of it,</v>

4247
01:42:55.090 --> 01:42:55.923
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4248
01:42:56.410 --> 01:42:59.920
<v Speaker 3>I'm a big believer and a big supporter of personal freedom and this is,</v>

4249
01:43:00.190 --> 01:43:00.461
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4250
01:43:00.461 --> 01:43:05.080
<v Speaker 3>it's one of the few that a very few people are exercising but is a really</v>

4251
01:43:05.440 --> 01:43:08.320
<v Speaker 3>radically dangerous pursuit for the average person.</v>

4252
01:43:08.440 --> 01:43:08.951
<v Speaker 3>For you.</v>

4253
01:43:08.951 --> 01:43:09.581
<v Speaker 3>Maybe not,</v>

4254
01:43:09.581 --> 01:43:09.761
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4255
01:43:09.761 --> 01:43:11.470
<v Speaker 3>you shake your head because a,</v>

4256
01:43:11.471 --> 01:43:12.251
<v Speaker 3>you're competent.</v>

4257
01:43:12.251 --> 01:43:12.431
<v Speaker 3>B,</v>

4258
01:43:12.431 --> 01:43:15.370
<v Speaker 3>you're aware and see it's something you love to do and you've been doing your</v>

4259
01:43:15.371 --> 01:43:15.761
<v Speaker 3>whole life.</v>

4260
01:43:15.761 --> 01:43:17.350
<v Speaker 3>You have a massive amount of experience for him.</v>

4261
01:43:17.530 --> 01:43:19.180
<v Speaker 3>But for the average person and try to do it,</v>

4262
01:43:19.181 --> 01:43:21.910
<v Speaker 3>it could be mean if everybody had to free solo clamp,</v>

4263
01:43:21.911 --> 01:43:23.460
<v Speaker 3>just stop and think about it via that.</v>

4264
01:43:23.710 --> 01:43:25.960
<v Speaker 3>It'd be a fucking raining people.</v>

4265
01:43:25.961 --> 01:43:28.690
<v Speaker 3>But if everybody put like 17 years at work and the learning how,</v>

4266
01:43:28.710 --> 01:43:28.901
<v Speaker 3>and then,</v>

4267
01:43:28.901 --> 01:43:29.261
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4268
01:43:29.261 --> 01:43:29.471
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4269
01:43:29.471 --> 01:43:30.460
<v Speaker 3>I'd probably be like,</v>

4270
01:43:30.820 --> 01:43:31.980
<v Speaker 3>there'll be no TVs,</v>

4271
01:43:31.981 --> 01:43:33.160
<v Speaker 3>there would be no cell phones,</v>

4272
01:43:33.161 --> 01:43:34.090
<v Speaker 3>there'll be no cars.</v>

4273
01:43:34.091 --> 01:43:35.110
<v Speaker 3>If everybody did that,</v>

4274
01:43:35.111 --> 01:43:38.110
<v Speaker 3>no one would get anything done because they'd be just consistently focusing on</v>

4275
01:43:38.111 --> 01:43:40.110
<v Speaker 3>not falling in climbing.</v>

4276
01:43:40.550 --> 01:43:41.383
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

4277
01:43:41.560 --> 01:43:43.900
<v Speaker 3>but it's an interesting personal freedom issue.</v>

4278
01:43:43.930 --> 01:43:44.540
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

4279
01:43:44.540 --> 01:43:47.710
<v Speaker 3>well there are certain things that were restricted from doing in this country</v>

4280
01:43:47.711 --> 01:43:52.040
<v Speaker 3>and this world and we're restricted from taking a amount of chances.</v>

4281
01:43:52.310 --> 01:43:56.040
<v Speaker 1>But that one is just still completely out there in the wild though.</v>

4282
01:43:56.330 --> 01:43:59.480
<v Speaker 1>It's one that I think like going hiking or any kind of outdoor recreation is</v>

4283
01:43:59.481 --> 01:43:59.990
<v Speaker 1>pretty,</v>

4284
01:43:59.990 --> 01:44:03.240
<v Speaker 1>pretty unrestricted in the U s I'm here alleged just wander into the woods and</v>

4285
01:44:03.300 --> 01:44:04.133
<v Speaker 1>go have an adventure.</v>

4286
01:44:04.370 --> 01:44:04.671
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

4287
01:44:04.671 --> 01:44:06.470
<v Speaker 1>but I mean the nanny state government that we have,</v>

4288
01:44:06.471 --> 01:44:08.000
<v Speaker 1>I'm surprised that someone doesn't like,</v>

4289
01:44:08.001 --> 01:44:08.241
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

4290
01:44:08.241 --> 01:44:09.110
<v Speaker 1>you can't climb.</v>

4291
01:44:09.140 --> 01:44:09.470
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4292
01:44:09.470 --> 01:44:09.681
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

4293
01:44:09.681 --> 01:44:09.861
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

4294
01:44:09.861 --> 01:44:10.970
<v Speaker 1>get down from their son.</v>

4295
01:44:11.060 --> 01:44:11.361
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4296
01:44:11.361 --> 01:44:12.920
<v Speaker 1>cause that's sort of the attitude.</v>

4297
01:44:13.390 --> 01:44:14.223
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4298
01:44:14.620 --> 01:44:14.920
<v Speaker 4>I dunno.</v>

4299
01:44:14.920 --> 01:44:15.753
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

4300
01:44:17.230 --> 01:44:17.590
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

4301
01:44:17.590 --> 01:44:19.570
<v Speaker 5>No one ever gets in trouble at all for climbing anything.</v>

4302
01:44:19.571 --> 01:44:21.460
<v Speaker 5>As long as it's not a public building or something like that.</v>

4303
01:44:22.320 --> 01:44:24.280
<v Speaker 5>You don't think so unless it's on private property,</v>

4304
01:44:24.281 --> 01:44:25.870
<v Speaker 5>in which case the landowner gets to choose,</v>

4305
01:44:26.080 --> 01:44:26.710
<v Speaker 5>you know.</v>

4306
01:44:26.710 --> 01:44:26.831
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

4307
01:44:26.831 --> 01:44:27.370
<v Speaker 5>wow.</v>

4308
01:44:27.370 --> 01:44:29.920
<v Speaker 5>So all public property,</v>

4309
01:44:29.990 --> 01:44:33.220
<v Speaker 5>like public lands and national parks,</v>

4310
01:44:33.221 --> 01:44:35.340
<v Speaker 5>do you have some kind of like recreational management plan?</v>

4311
01:44:35.341 --> 01:44:35.681
<v Speaker 5>So I mean,</v>

4312
01:44:35.681 --> 01:44:38.530
<v Speaker 5>you're not allowed to like drill bolts or like change the rock in different ways</v>

4313
01:44:38.531 --> 01:44:41.410
<v Speaker 5>because when you climb you often and like put bolts for protection,</v>

4314
01:44:41.680 --> 01:44:42.160
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4315
01:44:42.160 --> 01:44:43.150
<v Speaker 5>black bolts in there.</v>

4316
01:44:43.350 --> 01:44:43.571
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4317
01:44:43.571 --> 01:44:45.300
<v Speaker 5>For if you're climbing up a blank face,</v>

4318
01:44:45.301 --> 01:44:47.380
<v Speaker 5>like say your brick wall hook a giant.</v>

4319
01:44:47.381 --> 01:44:48.214
<v Speaker 5>I Hook.</v>

4320
01:44:48.380 --> 01:44:49.121
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's small.</v>

4321
01:44:49.121 --> 01:44:49.360
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4322
01:44:49.360 --> 01:44:51.100
<v Speaker 5>But it's small enough that you can clip your care,</v>

4323
01:44:51.101 --> 01:44:52.780
<v Speaker 5>meaner into and then clip your rope into the beaner.</v>

4324
01:44:53.440 --> 01:44:54.700
<v Speaker 5>But um,</v>

4325
01:44:54.760 --> 01:44:55.271
<v Speaker 5>so I mean,</v>

4326
01:44:55.271 --> 01:44:56.950
<v Speaker 5>most national parks have some kind of plan,</v>

4327
01:44:56.980 --> 01:44:57.340
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4328
01:44:57.340 --> 01:44:58.030
<v Speaker 5>limiting,</v>

4329
01:44:58.030 --> 01:44:58.863
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4330
01:44:58.890 --> 01:44:59.140
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4331
01:44:59.140 --> 01:45:00.940
<v Speaker 5>bolting and things like that are,</v>

4332
01:45:00.941 --> 01:45:01.211
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4333
01:45:01.211 --> 01:45:03.340
<v Speaker 5>they have some kind of like management use thing,</v>

4334
01:45:03.670 --> 01:45:06.040
<v Speaker 5>but for the most part you can just go climb whatever you want.</v>

4335
01:45:06.420 --> 01:45:08.040
<v Speaker 1>Do you have any other crazy hobbies?</v>

4336
01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:09.211
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

4337
01:45:09.211 --> 01:45:09.960
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

4338
01:45:09.960 --> 01:45:10.501
<v Speaker 5>This is it.</v>

4339
01:45:10.501 --> 01:45:10.951
<v Speaker 5>This is just,</v>

4340
01:45:10.951 --> 01:45:13.620
<v Speaker 5>this fulfills all of your time because travel,</v>

4341
01:45:13.640 --> 01:45:13.910
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

4342
01:45:13.910 --> 01:45:16.200
<v Speaker 5>I read and I travel and I do stuff.</v>

4343
01:45:17.260 --> 01:45:18.093
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4344
01:45:18.480 --> 01:45:19.530
<v Speaker 1>it's a fascinating life,</v>

01:45:19.531 --> 01:45:19.771
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

4346
01:45:19.771 --> 01:45:20.191
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4347
01:45:20.191 --> 01:45:21.360
<v Speaker 1>I know it's yours and you're like,</v>

4348
01:45:21.361 --> 01:45:21.700

<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

4351
01:45:22.330 --> 01:45:23.220
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty normal.</v>

4352
01:45:23.221 --> 01:45:23.550
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4353
01:45:23.550 --> 01:45:25.260
<v Speaker 1>it's not pretty normal.</v>

4354
01:45:25.261 --> 01:45:26.340
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty normal to you.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

4362

<v Speaker 1>it's a very charming that you have this math that you've said that like 10</v>

4375
01:45:48.481 --> 01:45:48.960
<v Speaker 1>times,</v>

4391
01:46:06.290 --> 01:46:06.840
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

4392

4401
01:46:21.410 --> 01:46:25.150
<v Speaker 5>I mean I'd put a lot of work into it and I figure anybody that like loves what</v>

4402
01:46:25.151 --> 01:46:26.130
<v Speaker 5>they do and work hard at it,</v>

4403
01:46:26.131 --> 01:46:27.340
<v Speaker 5>it's probably going to get pretty good at it.</v>

4404
01:46:27.590 --> 01:46:28.790
<v Speaker 1>Do you have any goals?</v>

4405
01:46:28.800 --> 01:46:30.290
<v Speaker 1>Are there certain mountains that you have not?</v>

4406
01:46:30.640 --> 01:46:30.791

01:46:31.241 --> 01:46:32.170
<v Speaker 5>I got all kinds of,</v>

4409
01:46:32.171 --> 01:46:33.430
<v Speaker 5>I have a lot of like travel goals,</v>

4410
01:46:33.431 --> 01:46:36.970
<v Speaker 5>like places I want to go climbing and then I have actual like climbing</v>

4411
01:46:37.150 --> 01:46:38.050
<v Speaker 5>achievement goals,</v>

4412
01:46:38.051 --> 01:46:38.231
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4413
01:46:38.231 --> 01:46:40.690
<v Speaker 5>things that I want to climb or new things to do or whatever.</v>

4414
01:46:40.800 --> 01:46:41.061
<v Speaker 5>What's,</v>

4415
01:46:41.061 --> 01:46:41.651
<v Speaker 5>what's a big one?</v>

4416
01:46:41.651 --> 01:46:42.484
<v Speaker 5>It's one,</v>

4417
01:46:42.820 --> 01:46:43.091
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

4418
01:46:43.091 --> 01:46:44.200
<v Speaker 5>They're all there on the DL,</v>

4419
01:46:44.201 --> 01:46:44.800
<v Speaker 5>you know.</v>

4420
01:46:44.800 --> 01:46:46.330
<v Speaker 5>Oh you can't tell people what I mean.</v>

4421
01:46:46.390 --> 01:46:46.870
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

4422
01:46:46.870 --> 01:46:47.740
<v Speaker 5>You don't want to talk about it?</v>

4423
01:46:48.100 --> 01:46:48.441
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

4424
01:46:48.441 --> 01:46:48.631
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

4425
01:46:48.631 --> 01:46:51.850
<v Speaker 5>so I don't really set like specific so long goals because I don't really like</v>

4426
01:46:51.851 --> 01:46:52.200
<v Speaker 5>the price.</v>

4427
01:46:52.200 --> 01:46:53.380
<v Speaker 5>Cause normally when you set a goal,</v>

4428
01:46:53.381 --> 01:46:55.270
<v Speaker 5>you go through the whole process of like you set the goal,</v>

4429
01:46:55.271 --> 01:46:56.110
<v Speaker 5>you train for it,</v>

4430
01:46:56.140 --> 01:46:56.921
<v Speaker 5>you achieve it,</v>

4431
01:46:56.921 --> 01:46:57.371
<v Speaker 5>whatever,</v>

4432
01:46:57.371 --> 01:46:57.790
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4433
01:46:57.790 --> 01:46:58.481
<v Speaker 5>you make it happen.</v>

4434
01:46:58.481 --> 01:47:00.460
<v Speaker 5>But the thing was so long because I don't really like that pressure.</v>

4435
01:47:00.700 --> 01:47:02.190
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to feel like I have to go solo.</v>

4436
01:47:02.200 --> 01:47:02.850
<v Speaker 5>Something.</v>

4437
01:47:02.850 --> 01:47:04.780
<v Speaker 5>So generally has that climate goals,</v>

4438
01:47:04.781 --> 01:47:06.820
<v Speaker 5>like retirement to climb with a rope or you know,</v>

4439
01:47:07.210 --> 01:47:08.080
<v Speaker 5>places I want to go.</v>

4440
01:47:08.440 --> 01:47:10.870
<v Speaker 5>But for so long it's more like a soloing fantasy,</v>

4441
01:47:10.871 --> 01:47:11.081
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4442
01:47:11.081 --> 01:47:14.560
<v Speaker 5>like something I'd love to do and I'll sort of keep it in the back of my mind.</v>

4443
01:47:14.561 --> 01:47:16.540
<v Speaker 5>Like what kind of shape I'd have to be in to do it.</v>

4444
01:47:16.600 --> 01:47:17.350
<v Speaker 5>Or like,</v>

4445
01:47:17.350 --> 01:47:17.620
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4446
01:47:17.620 --> 01:47:18.820
<v Speaker 5>what time of year I'd have to be in,</v>

4447
01:47:18.821 --> 01:47:19.654
<v Speaker 5>what kind of shape,</v>

4448
01:47:20.050 --> 01:47:20.883
<v Speaker 5>but um,</v>

4449
01:47:20.920 --> 01:47:22.870
<v Speaker 5>but it's never like that's my goal for this season.</v>

4450
01:47:22.871 --> 01:47:24.070
<v Speaker 5>It's more like if it happens,</v>

4451
01:47:24.071 --> 01:47:24.760
<v Speaker 5>it'd be sweet.</v>

4452
01:47:24.760 --> 01:47:25.290
<v Speaker 5>If not,</v>

4453
01:47:25.290 --> 01:47:25.570
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4454
01:47:25.570 --> 01:47:26.160
<v Speaker 5>whatever.</v>

4455
01:47:26.160 --> 01:47:31.160
<v Speaker 1>Why has no one come up with a television show that follows you?</v>

4456
01:47:31.830 --> 01:47:34.470
<v Speaker 1>Climbing up mountains and,</v>

4457
01:47:34.600 --> 01:47:35.170
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

4458
01:47:35.170 --> 01:47:36.010
<v Speaker 1>and broadcast.</v>

4459
01:47:36.011 --> 01:47:36.211
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4460
01:47:36.211 --> 01:47:37.140
<v Speaker 1>people have talked about it,</v>

4461
01:47:37.141 --> 01:47:38.550
<v Speaker 1>but the thing is after that,</v>

4462
01:47:38.640 --> 01:47:40.120
<v Speaker 1>after anybody chats to me for a while,</v>

4463
01:47:40.121 --> 01:47:40.411
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>

4464
01:47:40.411 --> 01:47:42.210
<v Speaker 1>turns out that guy's actually really boring.</v>

4465
01:47:42.400 --> 01:47:43.530
<v Speaker 1>You're boring at all men.</v>

4466
01:47:43.850 --> 01:47:44.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4467
01:47:44.410 --> 01:47:45.690
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you're boring it all.</v>

4468
01:47:45.691 --> 01:47:45.961
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

4469
01:47:45.961 --> 01:47:46.770
<v Speaker 1>Fascinating.</v>

4470
01:47:46.770 --> 01:47:46.951
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

4471
01:47:46.951 --> 01:47:47.720
<v Speaker 1>you're mellow.</v>

4472
01:47:47.720 --> 01:47:49.520
<v Speaker 1>You're confused when Ella was born.</v>

4473
01:47:49.521 --> 01:47:49.630
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

4474
01:47:49.630 --> 01:47:51.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm very interesting.</v>

4475
01:47:51.060 --> 01:47:51.893
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing,</v>

4476
01:47:52.140 --> 01:47:54.060
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing boring about you.</v>

4477
01:47:54.061 --> 01:47:56.070
<v Speaker 1>You have a very distinct personality,</v>

4478
01:47:56.071 --> 01:47:59.220
<v Speaker 1>a very distinct way of looking at this very odd life that you have.</v>

4479
01:47:59.221 --> 01:48:00.990
<v Speaker 1>It's very compatible for what you do.</v>

4480
01:48:01.390 --> 01:48:02.223
<v Speaker 1>It's not boring.</v>

4481
01:48:02.470 --> 01:48:02.850
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4482
01:48:02.850 --> 01:48:05.460
<v Speaker 1>what you do is not even remotely fucking boring.</v>

4483
01:48:05.490 --> 01:48:06.990
<v Speaker 1>It's hair raising.</v>

4484
01:48:06.991 --> 01:48:08.370
<v Speaker 1>It makes people shit their pants,</v>

4485
01:48:08.371 --> 01:48:08.941
<v Speaker 1>my hands,</v>

4486
01:48:08.941 --> 01:48:09.361
<v Speaker 1>sweat.</v>

4487
01:48:09.361 --> 01:48:10.140
<v Speaker 1>Watching your fitness,</v>

4488
01:48:10.140 --> 01:48:10.741
<v Speaker 1>what I was talking about,</v>

4489
01:48:10.741 --> 01:48:10.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4490
01:48:10.950 --> 01:48:12.390
<v Speaker 1>super bowl versus training.</v>

4491
01:48:12.420 --> 01:48:12.931
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

4492
01:48:12.931 --> 01:48:15.330
<v Speaker 1>Like you're saying the Superbowl stuff looks amazing.</v>

4493
01:48:15.331 --> 01:48:15.571
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4494
01:48:15.571 --> 01:48:16.660
<v Speaker 1>like the big solos,</v>

4495
01:48:16.670 --> 01:48:16.951
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

4496
01:48:16.951 --> 01:48:17.521
<v Speaker 1>that's red.</v>

4497
01:48:17.521 --> 01:48:18.600
<v Speaker 1>But what she did on 60 minutes,</v>

4498
01:48:18.601 --> 01:48:19.680
<v Speaker 1>you said wasn't even that big.</v>

4499
01:48:20.160 --> 01:48:20.580
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

4500
01:48:20.580 --> 01:48:20.851
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

4501
01:48:20.851 --> 01:48:21.240
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

4502
01:48:21.240 --> 01:48:23.520
<v Speaker 5>but still I only do that kind of thing handful of times a year.</v>

4503
01:48:23.970 --> 01:48:24.690
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

4504
01:48:24.690 --> 01:48:27.300
<v Speaker 5>the majority of the year I'm just going out climbing with my friends and just</v>

4505
01:48:27.420 --> 01:48:28.350
<v Speaker 5>normal climbing.</v>

4506
01:48:28.460 --> 01:48:30.480
<v Speaker 5>You know the same thing that people are doing in the gym except</v>

4507
01:48:31.390 --> 01:48:32.830
<v Speaker 1>they have shows,</v>

4508
01:48:33.040 --> 01:48:33.580
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

4509
01:48:33.580 --> 01:48:34.880
<v Speaker 1>we're going to have</v>

4510
01:48:36.400 --> 01:48:39.940
<v Speaker 1>like I don't give a shout back on shops and they come in and they go,</v>

4511
01:48:39.941 --> 01:48:40.870

<v Speaker 1>And the guy's like,</v>

4517
01:48:45.881 --> 01:48:46.181
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

4519
01:48:51.701 --> 01:48:52.091
<v Speaker 1>they're selling.</v>

4520
01:48:52.091 --> 01:48:52.560
<v Speaker 1>Dammit.</v>

4521
01:48:52.560 --> 01:48:55.120
<v Speaker 1>That kind of shit makes the world worse and I don't want to contribute to that.</v>

4522
01:48:55.121 --> 01:48:56.960
<v Speaker 1>You would not be contributing it to him,</v>

4523
01:48:57.010 --> 01:48:57.371
<v Speaker 1>my friend.</v>

4524
01:48:57.371 --> 01:48:58.850
<v Speaker 1>What I'm saying is that there's,</v>

4525
01:48:59.230 --> 01:49:04.230
<v Speaker 1>people are fascinated by shit that's not even close to is interesting as you are</v>

4526
01:49:04.601 --> 01:49:05.434
<v Speaker 1>what you're doing.</v>

4527
01:49:05.500 --> 01:49:07.600
<v Speaker 1>I really think it would be an amazing show.</v>

4528
01:49:07.601 --> 01:49:09.010
<v Speaker 1>I think you're dead wrong.</v>

4529
01:49:09.011 --> 01:49:09.880
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's,</v>

4530
01:49:09.940 --> 01:49:10.750
<v Speaker 1>there's been talk</v>

4531
01:49:10.750 --> 01:49:11.420
<v Speaker 5>like I doubt it.</v>

4532
01:49:11.420 --> 01:49:12.800
<v Speaker 5>I doubt there would be a show,</v>

4533
01:49:12.801 --> 01:49:13.634
<v Speaker 5>but I think there probably will.</v>

4534
01:49:13.850 --> 01:49:14.810
<v Speaker 1>Why wouldn't it be a show?</v>

4535
01:49:14.811 --> 01:49:16.400
<v Speaker 1>So when he's a fucking step is honestly,</v>

4536
01:49:16.401 --> 01:49:17.330
<v Speaker 1>there's not much content,</v>

4537
01:49:17.331 --> 01:49:17.541
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4538
01:49:17.541 --> 01:49:18.950
<v Speaker 1>like because,</v>

4539
01:49:19.490 --> 01:49:22.250
<v Speaker 1>well what if you do like 10 episodes or something and you have to sell us</v>

4540
01:49:22.251 --> 01:49:23.210
<v Speaker 1>something big for each one.</v>

4541
01:49:23.211 --> 01:49:27.740
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't want to not watch real housewives of Beverly Hills and I'm glad I</v>

4542
01:49:27.741 --> 01:49:28.130
<v Speaker 1>have it.</v>

4543
01:49:28.130 --> 01:49:28.911
<v Speaker 1>This is the idea.</v>

4544
01:49:28.911 --> 01:49:29.511
<v Speaker 1>This is my idea.</v>

4545
01:49:29.511 --> 01:49:30.310
<v Speaker 1>You ready for this?</v>

4546
01:49:30.310 --> 01:49:31.790
<v Speaker 1>We may get a desk squad production.</v>

4547
01:49:31.791 --> 01:49:35.990
<v Speaker 1>Then what we're gonna do is we're going to bring you with Brian in between all</v>

4548
01:49:35.991 --> 01:49:37.250
<v Speaker 1>of your climbing,</v>

4549
01:49:37.280 --> 01:49:41.120
<v Speaker 1>you're going to hang out with Brian and all of his porn star friends and our</v>

4550
01:49:41.121 --> 01:49:41.480

4559
01:49:48.130 --> 01:49:48.963
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4560
01:49:49.410 --> 01:49:51.220

4561
01:49:54.250 --> 01:49:55.550

01:49:57.641 --> 01:49:58.240
<v Speaker 5>Whoa,</v>

4566
01:50:00.281 --> 01:50:01.114
<v Speaker 5>Do you want to meet them?</v>

4567
01:50:01.470 --> 01:50:01.630
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

4568
01:50:01.630 --> 01:50:01.990
<v Speaker 5>let's say it,</v>

4570
01:50:03.280 --> 01:50:04.270
<v Speaker 5>We can make this happen.</v>

4571
01:50:04.300 --> 01:50:05.680
<v Speaker 5>That's an easy thing to make happen.</v>

4572
01:50:05.950 --> 01:50:06.580
<v Speaker 5>I'm not kidding.</v>

4573
01:50:06.580 --> 01:50:06.940
<v Speaker 5>Huh?</v>

4574
01:50:06.940 --> 01:50:08.590
<v Speaker 5>That's a really easy thing to make happen.</v>

4575
01:50:08.620 --> 01:50:09.130
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4576
01:50:09.130 --> 01:50:10.090
<v Speaker 5>You want to go hang out with him?</v>

4577
01:50:10.330 --> 01:50:12.820
<v Speaker 5>How long had towns for from this parking lot.</v>

4578
01:50:12.821 --> 01:50:13.780
<v Speaker 5>I was going to drive to Vegas,</v>

4579
01:50:13.781 --> 01:50:16.000
<v Speaker 5>but maybe you drive to hang out with Brian in Burbank.</v>

4580
01:50:16.001 --> 01:50:16.111

<v Speaker 1>And then the next day I'm the commentator when I do is I explain the nuances of,</v>

4726
01:54:16.020 --> 01:54:16.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4727
01:54:16.340 --> 01:54:18.320
<v Speaker 1>what's in my uterus and I got a death.</v>

4728
01:54:18.440 --> 01:54:18.801
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

4729
01:54:18.801 --> 01:54:20.480
<v Speaker 1>Like what he has to look out for,</v>

4730
01:54:20.530 --> 01:54:20.810
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

4731
01:54:20.810 --> 01:54:23.180
<v Speaker 1>what's going to happen if he doesn't do that,</v>

4732
01:54:23.240 --> 01:54:24.590
<v Speaker 1>what's going to happen?</v>

4733
01:54:24.720 --> 01:54:25.011
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4734
01:54:25.011 --> 01:54:25.990
<v Speaker 1>that's me at the wins.</v>

4735
01:54:29.230 --> 01:54:31.280
<v Speaker 1>It's a handmade video.</v>

4736
01:54:31.281 --> 01:54:33.920
<v Speaker 1>People get silly cause they took that one picture and they photoshopped it,</v>

4737
01:54:34.070 --> 01:54:35.270
<v Speaker 1>you know about Photoshop right</v>

4738
01:54:36.950 --> 01:54:37.690
<v Speaker 1>out there in the woods.</v>

4739
01:54:37.690 --> 01:54:38.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4740
01:54:38.140 --> 01:54:38.720
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4741
01:54:38.720 --> 01:54:39.620
<v Speaker 1>but so,</v>

4742
01:54:39.880 --> 01:54:40.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4743
01:54:40.320 --> 01:54:40.640
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

4744
01:54:40.640 --> 01:54:41.630
<v Speaker 1>if you can make it,</v>

4745
01:54:41.740 --> 01:54:42.500
<v Speaker 1>it would be a trip.</v>

4746
01:54:42.500 --> 01:54:43.720
<v Speaker 1>It will freak you out to be,</v>

4747
01:54:44.010 --> 01:54:44.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4748
01:54:44.300 --> 01:54:48.140
<v Speaker 1>15 16,000 people completely sold out Mandalay Bay events center.</v>

4749
01:54:48.170 --> 01:54:48.950
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be nuts.</v>

4750
01:54:48.950 --> 01:54:49.730
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of bad ass.</v>

4751
01:54:49.730 --> 01:54:51.380
<v Speaker 1>It's a wild thing to see live.</v>

4752
01:54:51.400 --> 01:54:51.950
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

4753
01:54:51.950 --> 01:54:52.310
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

4754
01:54:52.310 --> 01:54:56.630
<v Speaker 1>Cause you're gonna see the best martial artists on the face of the planet.</v>

4755
01:54:56.631 --> 01:54:57.464
<v Speaker 1>Without a doubt.</v>

4756
01:54:57.470 --> 01:55:00.530
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's a few other guys that won't be competing this Saturday night that</v>

4757
01:55:00.531 --> 01:55:01.370
<v Speaker 1>are also the best,</v>

4758
01:55:01.610 --> 01:55:06.610
<v Speaker 1>but the examples of of excellence that you're going to get there between Overeem</v>

4759
01:55:07.131 --> 01:55:08.540
<v Speaker 1>and Aldo and Edgar,</v>

4760
01:55:08.570 --> 01:55:12.380
<v Speaker 1>just those guys in big foot Silva and there's a guy named Damien Maia from</v>

4761
01:55:12.381 --> 01:55:16.790
<v Speaker 1>Brazil was the baddest fucking Jujitsu guy on the planet and MMA and he's</v>

4762
01:55:16.791 --> 01:55:17.331
<v Speaker 1>fighting this guy,</v>

4763
01:55:17.331 --> 01:55:20.510
<v Speaker 1>John Fitch was this bad ass American wrestler and Oh,</v>

4764
01:55:20.660 --> 01:55:22.210
<v Speaker 1>it's gotta be from your site.</v>

4765
01:55:22.340 --> 01:55:23.270
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

4766
01:55:23.271 --> 01:55:24.240
<v Speaker 1>Are you compensating for it?</v>

4767
01:55:24.241 --> 01:55:24.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4768
01:55:24.690 --> 01:55:25.370
<v Speaker 1>That's my,</v>

4769
01:55:25.370 --> 01:55:26.240
<v Speaker 1>that's my other job.</v>

4770
01:55:26.750 --> 01:55:27.171
<v Speaker 1>My job.</v>

4771
01:55:27.171 --> 01:55:28.070
<v Speaker 1>I keep a bunch of jobs.</v>

4772
01:55:28.071 --> 01:55:28.904
<v Speaker 1>I'm like a Jamaican.</v>

4773
01:55:29.360 --> 01:55:30.420
<v Speaker 1>I try to keep your hustle,</v>

4774
01:55:30.421 --> 01:55:31.254
<v Speaker 1>our jobs,</v>

4775
01:55:32.510 --> 01:55:34.820
<v Speaker 1>but these are all things that I'm drawn to.</v>

4776
01:55:35.420 --> 01:55:36.380
<v Speaker 1>Much like your,</v>

4777
01:55:36.381 --> 01:55:37.790
<v Speaker 1>your thing with the mountain climbing.</v>

4778
01:55:37.850 --> 01:55:40.280
<v Speaker 1>It probably seems unreal t that's what I'm saying.</v>

4779
01:55:40.281 --> 01:55:45.150
<v Speaker 1>Like it would be another paradigm shifting moment that the UFC did to see how</v>

4780
01:55:45.151 --> 01:55:46.050
<v Speaker 1>fucking crazy it can be.</v>

4781
01:55:46.051 --> 01:55:49.740
<v Speaker 1>If you can stay please did actually get in cause I mean cause I can just do that</v>

4782
01:55:50.060 --> 01:55:53.790
<v Speaker 1>in front row and we'll get you front row experience.</v>

4783
01:55:53.800 --> 01:55:55.650
<v Speaker 1>I want to make sure that you are,</v>

4784
01:55:55.651 --> 01:55:57.420
<v Speaker 1>I will have you sit behind me.</v>

4785
01:55:57.540 --> 01:56:00.660
<v Speaker 1>I will give you a seat right behind me for the UFC.</v>

4786
01:56:00.661 --> 01:56:01.800
<v Speaker 1>You will be right there.</v>

4787
01:56:01.801 --> 01:56:02.550
<v Speaker 1>The cage.</v>

4788
01:56:02.550 --> 01:56:05.190
<v Speaker 1>You could step forward and touch it with your hand if you want him to.</v>

4789
01:56:05.190 --> 01:56:05.700
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>

4790
01:56:05.700 --> 01:56:08.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah it'd be the nuttiest fucking thing I've ever seen in your life.</v>

4791
01:56:08.781 --> 01:56:09.614
<v Speaker 1>I don't like.</v>

4792
01:56:09.710 --> 01:56:09.971
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4793
01:56:09.971 --> 01:56:10.600
<v Speaker 1>they're going to get there.</v>

4794
01:56:10.600 --> 01:56:11.640
<v Speaker 1>People listen,</v>

4795
01:56:11.840 --> 01:56:12.390
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

4796
01:56:12.390 --> 01:56:13.980
<v Speaker 1>this is this their job,</v>

4797
01:56:14.420 --> 01:56:17.550
<v Speaker 1>their job is to try to hurt the other guy and the other guy tries to hurt them.</v>

4798
01:56:17.551 --> 01:56:18.960
<v Speaker 1>But it's very scientific.</v>

4799
01:56:18.961 --> 01:56:20.010
<v Speaker 1>It's very technical,</v>

4800
01:56:20.580 --> 01:56:21.600
<v Speaker 1>very good experience.</v>

4801
01:56:21.601 --> 01:56:22.830
<v Speaker 1>So it's a great experiment.</v>

4802
01:56:23.190 --> 01:56:25.950
<v Speaker 1>What it is is is human competition and it's,</v>

4803
01:56:26.080 --> 01:56:26.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4804
01:56:26.580 --> 01:56:28.930
<v Speaker 1>one on one competition and it's most difficult for him.</v>

4805
01:56:28.960 --> 01:56:29.171
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

4806
01:56:29.171 --> 01:56:33.450
<v Speaker 1>you're using your body to try to submit and stop another person who's also using</v>

4807
01:56:33.451 --> 01:56:34.680
<v Speaker 1>their body and that's all you have.</v>

4808
01:56:34.890 --> 01:56:37.950
<v Speaker 1>You have pads over your knuckles and your wits and your techniques and your</v>

4809
01:56:37.951 --> 01:56:41.790
<v Speaker 1>conditioning and your training and gut and your ability to overcome the pressure</v>

4810
01:56:41.791 --> 01:56:43.500
<v Speaker 1>of the moment and all those things.</v>

4811
01:56:43.530 --> 01:56:45.840
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be fucking crazy.</v>

4812
01:56:45.930 --> 01:56:46.110
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>

4813
01:56:46.110 --> 01:56:46.750

4814
01:56:46.750 --> 01:56:47.221

<v Speaker 1>you'll have yourself a party.</v>

4828
01:57:09.120 --> 01:57:10.380
<v Speaker 1>where to get the good ecstasy.</v>

4829
01:57:11.340 --> 01:57:12.173

4830
01:57:12.480 --> 01:57:14.010
<v Speaker 1>we might ruin your climbing career,</v>

4831
01:57:14.011 --> 01:57:14.701
<v Speaker 1>but trust me,</v>

4839
01:57:25.950 --> 01:57:26.800
<v Speaker 1>We can do it right here.</v>

4840
01:57:26.850 --> 01:57:29.990
<v Speaker 1>Just clear off these salt lamps and put the deer antlers.</v>

4841
01:57:30.280 --> 01:57:31.200
<v Speaker 1>Climb the lox store.</v>

4842

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4843
01:57:31.830 --> 01:57:32.480
<v Speaker 1>we could go up to,</v>

4844
01:57:32.480 --> 01:57:32.671

4845
01:57:32.671 --> 01:57:33.451
<v Speaker 1>you could climb the parents.</v>

4846
01:57:33.451 --> 01:57:34.201
<v Speaker 1>Really low angle.</v>

4847
01:57:34.201 --> 01:57:35.490
<v Speaker 1>That's seems kind of fruity.</v>

4848
01:57:35.700 --> 01:57:36.450
<v Speaker 1>Pretty easy.</v>

4849
01:57:36.450 --> 01:57:36.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4850
01:57:36.730 --> 01:57:37.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4851
01:57:37.500 --> 01:57:38.300
<v Speaker 1>That's hilarious.</v>

4852
01:57:38.300 --> 01:57:40.370
<v Speaker 1>Did on fear factor where they claimed the Luxor was,</v>

4853
01:57:40.440 --> 01:57:41.590
<v Speaker 1>they actually slid down?</v>

4854
01:57:42.770 --> 01:57:43.603
<v Speaker 1>It</v>

4855
01:57:45.940 --> 01:57:46.680
<v Speaker 1>probably was.</v>

4856
01:57:46.680 --> 01:57:49.200
<v Speaker 1>There was quite a few things they did on fear factor that we're dangerous.</v>

4857
01:57:49.240 --> 01:57:50.970
<v Speaker 1>Did you have a call in deciding what they did?</v>

4858
01:57:51.060 --> 01:57:51.271
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

4859
01:57:51.271 --> 01:57:52.104
<v Speaker 1>I did not.</v>

4860
01:57:52.290 --> 01:57:53.123
<v Speaker 1>There was,</v>

4861
01:57:53.310 --> 01:57:55.020
<v Speaker 1>there was two times where I would have said no.</v>

4862
01:57:55.080 --> 01:57:56.860
<v Speaker 1>One time where they had a ride bowls.</v>

4863
01:57:57.440 --> 01:57:58.890
<v Speaker 1>I definitely was not into this.</v>

4864
01:57:58.920 --> 01:58:00.630
<v Speaker 1>It was because they thought they could actually get killed.</v>

4865
01:58:00.900 --> 01:58:01.411
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

4866
01:58:01.411 --> 01:58:02.040
<v Speaker 1>they could have.</v>

4867
01:58:02.040 --> 01:58:04.770
<v Speaker 1>We had two different stunt coordinators.</v>

4868
01:58:04.860 --> 01:58:07.650
<v Speaker 1>There's this one guy from the beginning who was like,</v>

4869
01:58:07.651 --> 01:58:09.120
<v Speaker 1>you know they're Badass dudes.</v>

4870
01:58:09.130 --> 01:58:11.040
<v Speaker 1>You know how you're looking at like climbing,</v>

4871
01:58:11.740 --> 01:58:12.870
<v Speaker 1>not fine,</v>

4872
01:58:13.290 --> 01:58:15.090
<v Speaker 1>so his sky bet stop man.</v>

4873
01:58:15.091 --> 01:58:16.110
<v Speaker 1>His whole lives name's Perry.</v>

4874
01:58:16.111 --> 01:58:16.860
<v Speaker 1>Great Guy.</v>

4875
01:58:16.860 --> 01:58:18.120
<v Speaker 1>And his attitude was like,</v>

4876
01:58:18.121 --> 01:58:18.390
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

4877
01:58:18.390 --> 01:58:19.080
<v Speaker 1>I would do it.</v>

4878
01:58:19.080 --> 01:58:19.900
<v Speaker 1>I'll fucking do it.</v>

4879
01:58:19.900 --> 01:58:20.160
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

4880
01:58:20.160 --> 01:58:20.580
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

4881
01:58:20.580 --> 01:58:22.710
<v Speaker 1>if his idea was that they want to be on TV,</v>

4882
01:58:22.711 --> 01:58:23.544
<v Speaker 1>they should do it too.</v>

4883
01:58:23.730 --> 01:58:27.240
<v Speaker 1>But I'm cool with a lot of that until it gets to animals.</v>

4884
01:58:27.570 --> 01:58:32.190
<v Speaker 1>Animals are very unpredictable and this thing was they were going to ride these,</v>

4885
01:58:32.370 --> 01:58:34.650
<v Speaker 1>I mean these bulls were fucking enormous.</v>

4886
01:58:34.651 --> 01:58:38.280
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you've ever been like right next to a riding bull before,</v>

4887
01:58:38.281 --> 01:58:40.800
<v Speaker 1>but I was standing on the like sort of,</v>

4888
01:58:40.801 --> 01:58:44.920
<v Speaker 1>there's like a platform next to where the cages and I'm looking down at the ball</v>

4889
01:58:44.921 --> 01:58:45.311
<v Speaker 1>and I'm like,</v>

4890
01:58:45.311 --> 01:58:47.290
<v Speaker 1>no fucking way.</v>

4891
01:58:47.500 --> 01:58:49.240
<v Speaker 1>There's no way I would get on that thing.</v>

4892
01:58:49.410 --> 01:58:52.870
<v Speaker 1>There are thousands of pounds and they're just fucking in there and you see as</v>

4893
01:58:52.871 --> 01:58:55.240
<v Speaker 1>muscles and I go onto that to ride the ball.</v>

4894
01:58:55.300 --> 01:58:59.110
<v Speaker 1>They don't get to ride the bull very long because the bull fucking sends him</v>

4895
01:58:59.111 --> 01:59:00.940
<v Speaker 1>into orbit within like three seconds.</v>

4896
01:59:01.790 --> 01:59:05.560
<v Speaker 1>Good Rodeo guy tries to get to eight seconds.</v>

4897
01:59:06.100 --> 01:59:06.940
<v Speaker 1>It's not like,</v>

4898
01:59:07.120 --> 01:59:08.890
<v Speaker 1>you know there's a guy who could just do it all day long.</v>

4899
01:59:08.891 --> 01:59:11.740
<v Speaker 1>Like you can climb all day long and no one can do that.</v>

4900
01:59:12.160 --> 01:59:15.130
<v Speaker 1>No one who's ever lived who rides a bull until the bowls tired.</v>

4901
01:59:15.160 --> 01:59:15.993
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't happen.</v>

4902
01:59:16.030 --> 01:59:17.020
<v Speaker 1>You go flying.</v>

4903
01:59:17.140 --> 01:59:20.500
<v Speaker 1>So it's a matter of how long does it take before you fail.</v>

4904
01:59:20.560 --> 01:59:21.371
<v Speaker 1>That's all it is.</v>

4905
01:59:21.371 --> 01:59:24.130
<v Speaker 1>It's like try to succeed for as long as possible,</v>

4906
01:59:24.160 --> 01:59:25.000
<v Speaker 1>but you can't win.</v>

4907
01:59:25.030 --> 01:59:27.480
<v Speaker 1>And then does the work keeps the bowl from crushing here?</v>

4908
01:59:27.970 --> 01:59:29.020
<v Speaker 1>That's a good question.</v>

4909
01:59:29.021 --> 01:59:30.250
<v Speaker 1>They have rodeo clowns.</v>

4910
01:59:30.251 --> 01:59:32.470
<v Speaker 1>They have a bunch of different people that distractible.</v>

4911
01:59:32.860 --> 01:59:34.180
<v Speaker 1>But my beef was,</v>

4912
01:59:34.181 --> 01:59:34.811
<v Speaker 1>the guy was like,</v>

4913
01:59:34.811 --> 01:59:36.400
<v Speaker 1>well these here are training clowns are,</v>

4914
01:59:36.401 --> 01:59:36.761
<v Speaker 1>these are,</v>

4915
01:59:36.761 --> 01:59:37.840
<v Speaker 1>these are training bowls.</v>

4916
01:59:38.890 --> 01:59:39.161
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

4917
01:59:39.161 --> 01:59:39.640
<v Speaker 1>what do you,</v>

4918
01:59:39.640 --> 01:59:40.061
<v Speaker 1>does that mean?</v>

4919
01:59:40.061 --> 01:59:40.271
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

4920
01:59:40.271 --> 01:59:40.361
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

4921
01:59:40.361 --> 01:59:42.580
<v Speaker 1>they're not as aggressive and like does that bold?</v>

4922
01:59:42.581 --> 01:59:42.761
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

4923
01:59:42.761 --> 01:59:43.930
<v Speaker 1>he's a fucking training ball.</v>

4924
01:59:44.020 --> 01:59:44.831
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't know he's your training,</v>

4925
01:59:44.831 --> 01:59:45.790
<v Speaker 1>but what's a bull?</v>

4926
01:59:45.850 --> 01:59:49.930
<v Speaker 1>So you're basing it on how he's thrown people off him in the past,</v>

4927
01:59:50.170 --> 01:59:51.550
<v Speaker 1>how he's going to throw these people off.</v>

4928
01:59:51.551 --> 01:59:51.821
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

4929
01:59:51.821 --> 01:59:55.360
<v Speaker 1>just some sort of a random calculation they making their cowboy mind.</v>

4930
01:59:55.780 --> 01:59:59.800
<v Speaker 1>And so we put these people on it and they got launched and we launched,</v>

4931
01:59:59.801 --> 02:00:00.660
<v Speaker 1>it was really scary.</v>

4932
02:00:00.710 --> 02:00:01.543
<v Speaker 1>One girl,</v>

4933
02:00:01.570 --> 02:00:04.840
<v Speaker 1>it was really scary cause she only weighed like 90 something pounds and she</v>

4934
02:00:04.841 --> 02:00:05.440
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

4935
02:00:05.440 --> 02:00:06.580
<v Speaker 1>I mean it would the bold,</v>

4936
02:00:06.640 --> 02:00:11.320
<v Speaker 1>like for one second she was on this boat and then she was literally flying</v>

4937
02:00:11.321 --> 02:00:16.210
<v Speaker 1>through the air and the bulls kicking and the bull's foot just went right past</v>

4938
02:00:16.211 --> 02:00:17.020
<v Speaker 1>her face.</v>

4939
02:00:17.020 --> 02:00:17.381
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

4940
02:00:17.381 --> 02:00:17.591
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

4941
02:00:17.591 --> 02:00:18.940
<v Speaker 1>if that bolt kicked her face,</v>

4942
02:00:18.941 --> 02:00:20.710
<v Speaker 1>it would crush every bone in her face.</v>

4943
02:00:20.740 --> 02:00:21.820
<v Speaker 1>Even though she has a helmet on,</v>

4944
02:00:21.990 --> 02:00:24.100
<v Speaker 1>it would still probably be crushed her helmet.</v>

4945
02:00:24.790 --> 02:00:25.900
<v Speaker 1>This is ridiculous.</v>

4946
02:00:26.020 --> 02:00:27.700
<v Speaker 1>And I think on that,</v>

4947
02:00:27.701 --> 02:00:28.361
<v Speaker 1>who approved that?</v>

4948
02:00:28.361 --> 02:00:28.720
<v Speaker 1>Shin,</v>

4949
02:00:28.720 --> 02:00:29.620
<v Speaker 1>NBC,</v>

4950
02:00:30.680 --> 02:00:32.260
<v Speaker 1>everybody that produced the show.</v>

4951
02:00:32.530 --> 02:00:35.380
<v Speaker 1>I think on that occasion they essentially rolled the dice.</v>

4952
02:00:35.410 --> 02:00:36.221
<v Speaker 1>No one got hurt,</v>

4953
02:00:36.221 --> 02:00:37.090
<v Speaker 1>everyone was fine.</v>

4954
02:00:37.210 --> 02:00:38.470
<v Speaker 1>But I think it was a lot of luck.</v>

4955
02:00:38.680 --> 02:00:42.340
<v Speaker 1>And then the other times the donkey comes a time where I said,</v>

4956
02:00:42.341 --> 02:00:42.701
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

4957
02:00:42.701 --> 02:00:43.450
<v Speaker 1>this is crazy,</v>

4958
02:00:43.450 --> 02:00:44.290
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't do this.</v>

4959
02:00:44.410 --> 02:00:44.681
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

4960
02:00:44.681 --> 02:00:46.150
<v Speaker 1>the people don't want to eat.</v>

4961
02:00:46.151 --> 02:00:46.481
<v Speaker 1>Come.</v>

4962
02:00:46.481 --> 02:00:46.751
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

4963
02:00:46.751 --> 02:00:51.250
<v Speaker 1>you can't just serve people come and like you cook crossing some sort of hey</v>

4964
02:00:51.590 --> 02:00:52.810
<v Speaker 1>putting out propaganda.</v>

4965
02:00:55.470 --> 02:00:56.303
<v Speaker 5>That's funny you say that.</v>

4966
02:00:56.380 --> 02:00:59.070
<v Speaker 5>Like when you were talking about earlier with the reality TV climbing stuff,</v>

4967
02:00:59.071 --> 02:00:59.761
<v Speaker 5>you won't follow me.</v>

4968
02:00:59.761 --> 02:01:03.690
<v Speaker 5>So as I actually saw like a pitch for a climbing reality TV thing where they</v>

4969
02:01:03.691 --> 02:01:04.910
<v Speaker 5>were going through your downside.</v>

4970
02:01:05.100 --> 02:01:05.933
<v Speaker 5>Put that down.</v>

4971
02:01:06.070 --> 02:01:07.270
<v Speaker 5>What do you want me this photo,</v>

4972
02:01:07.520 --> 02:01:10.340
<v Speaker 1>he went to some AVN awards because I brought you a present.</v>

4973
02:01:10.341 --> 02:01:11.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm like well thanks man.</v>

4974
02:01:11.440 --> 02:01:11.960
<v Speaker 1>He it,</v>

4975
02:01:11.960 --> 02:01:15.050
<v Speaker 1>it's just photo of guys with giant Cox and their tight jeans.</v>

4976
02:01:17.150 --> 02:01:17.600
<v Speaker 5>Anyway,</v>

4977
02:01:17.600 --> 02:01:18.470
<v Speaker 5>so I saw this,</v>

4978
02:01:18.471 --> 02:01:21.500
<v Speaker 5>I was on the wall stop pitch for this climbing show where they were like we're</v>

4979
02:01:21.501 --> 02:01:22.100
<v Speaker 5>going to,</v>

4980
02:01:22.100 --> 02:01:26.600
<v Speaker 5>it was supposed to be survivor meets a meets ultimate fighter or something like</v>

4981
02:01:26.601 --> 02:01:30.150
<v Speaker 5>that but in climbing sense and so like it was going to take non climbers and</v>

4982
02:01:30.160 --> 02:01:32.840
<v Speaker 5>then professional climbers and then we teach them to solo and then we'd sold a</v>

4983
02:01:32.841 --> 02:01:36.440
<v Speaker 5>big walls and it was this whole production and I was like how are you ever going</v>

4984
02:01:36.441 --> 02:01:39.290
<v Speaker 5>to have a show where you take non climbers and you solo walls with them know</v>

4985
02:01:39.291 --> 02:01:40.980
<v Speaker 5>it's like you can't like,</v>

4986
02:01:41.860 --> 02:01:42.470
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4987
02:01:42.470 --> 02:01:44.720
<v Speaker 5>you're like dude that's retarded.</v>

4988
02:01:44.810 --> 02:01:45.441
<v Speaker 5>It is retired.</v>

4989
02:01:45.441 --> 02:01:47.060
<v Speaker 5>And because also I actually,</v>

4990
02:01:47.061 --> 02:01:50.270
<v Speaker 5>I wrote back this scathing thing because they asked me for a casting call type</v>

4991
02:01:50.271 --> 02:01:51.100
<v Speaker 5>deal.</v>

4992
02:01:51.100 --> 02:01:54.630
<v Speaker 5>I mean take your email forwarded to me and I'll put it online and I did that.</v>

4993
02:01:54.680 --> 02:01:55.161
<v Speaker 5>We do that.</v>

4994
02:01:55.161 --> 02:01:55.930
<v Speaker 5>I can't vote for it.</v>

4995
02:01:55.930 --> 02:01:56.680
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4996
02:01:56.680 --> 02:01:57.950
<v Speaker 5>Cause I was like people would want to see it.</v>

4997
02:01:58.130 --> 02:01:59.030
<v Speaker 5>I was like what the heck?</v>

4998
02:01:59.031 --> 02:01:59.511
<v Speaker 5>You know I was like,</v>

4999
02:01:59.511 --> 02:02:02.240
<v Speaker 5>you might as well just have gladiators like butcher and each other on TV.</v>

5000
02:02:02.241 --> 02:02:03.950
<v Speaker 5>Cause you're basically just going to be watching carnage,</v>

5001
02:02:03.951 --> 02:02:04.161
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5002
02:02:04.161 --> 02:02:04.490
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

5003
02:02:04.490 --> 02:02:09.490
<v Speaker 5>I mean cause people will actually die kind of messed up and you know,</v>

5004
02:02:10.370 --> 02:02:10.611
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

5005
02:02:10.611 --> 02:02:10.911
<v Speaker 5>well that's it.</v>

5006
02:02:10.911 --> 02:02:12.560
<v Speaker 5>Nobody wants to see someone actually die.</v>

5007
02:02:12.561 --> 02:02:13.550
<v Speaker 5>You know it's so funny</v>

5008
02:02:13.710 --> 02:02:17.070
<v Speaker 1>you say that but yet this is what you do every day.</v>

5009
02:02:17.100 --> 02:02:17.461
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

5010
02:02:17.461 --> 02:02:18.810
<v Speaker 1>people will actually die.</v>

5011
02:02:18.811 --> 02:02:19.890
<v Speaker 1>But you do that</v>

5012
02:02:21.010 --> 02:02:22.380
<v Speaker 5>17 years right before it,</v>

5013
02:02:22.381 --> 02:02:22.591
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5014
02:02:22.591 --> 02:02:25.290
<v Speaker 5>how much time would they need to be conditioned before they could do anything?</v>

5015
02:02:25.291 --> 02:02:25.630
<v Speaker 5>What do you,</v>

5016
02:02:25.630 --> 02:02:26.640
<v Speaker 5>it depends on as he was.</v>

5017
02:02:26.641 --> 02:02:28.140
<v Speaker 5>I mean if it was something ultra easy,</v>

5018
02:02:28.141 --> 02:02:30.990
<v Speaker 5>I would just take any relatively fit person and take them out with a lot of</v>

5019
02:02:30.991 --> 02:02:32.160
<v Speaker 5>supervision and you know,</v>

5020
02:02:32.161 --> 02:02:34.020
<v Speaker 5>if it's like a really easy solo.</v>

5021
02:02:34.170 --> 02:02:37.320
<v Speaker 5>Did you have a bunch of dudes at the bottom holding a sheet by each corner?</v>

5022
02:02:37.350 --> 02:02:38.183
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>

5023
02:02:38.800 --> 02:02:40.980
<v Speaker 5>Like you know like my ex girlfriend,</v>

5024
02:02:40.981 --> 02:02:43.020
<v Speaker 5>I mean I took her up a handful of really,</v>

5025
02:02:43.021 --> 02:02:43.711
<v Speaker 5>really easy,</v>

5026
02:02:43.711 --> 02:02:45.240
<v Speaker 5>this is kind of like extreme hiking,</v>

5027
02:02:45.241 --> 02:02:45.930
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5028
02:02:45.930 --> 02:02:46.440
<v Speaker 5>but like,</v>

5029
02:02:46.440 --> 02:02:46.621
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5030
02:02:46.621 --> 02:02:47.900
<v Speaker 5>I'd be scrolling right next to her.</v>

5031
02:02:47.910 --> 02:02:50.850
<v Speaker 5>She's taking her time and you're kind of like talking her through it and you're</v>

5032
02:02:50.851 --> 02:02:51.001
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

5033
02:02:51.001 --> 02:02:51.121
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

5034
02:02:51.121 --> 02:02:51.541
<v Speaker 5>you're good,</v>

5035
02:02:51.541 --> 02:02:52.280
<v Speaker 5>you're good.</v>

5036
02:02:52.280 --> 02:02:52.570
<v Speaker 5>You know.</v>

5037
02:02:52.570 --> 02:02:55.980
<v Speaker 5>So I mean like really fit like the person at the top and give it some of that,</v>

5038
02:02:56.130 --> 02:02:56.281
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

5039
02:02:56.281 --> 02:02:56.521
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5040
02:02:56.521 --> 02:02:57.354
<v Speaker 5>something like that.</v>

5041
02:02:57.420 --> 02:03:00.960
<v Speaker 5>That's how we're all freaked out full of adrenaline.</v>

5042
02:03:01.210 --> 02:03:01.510
<v Speaker 5>I love,</v>

5043
02:03:01.510 --> 02:03:02.790
<v Speaker 5>but that's a wild ride.</v>

5044
02:03:04.160 --> 02:03:07.380
<v Speaker 5>Choose her or the mountain like did you have to get in that situation?</v>

5045
02:03:08.840 --> 02:03:09.673
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

5046
02:03:09.780 --> 02:03:10.740
<v Speaker 5>that kind of shit.</v>

5047
02:03:11.650 --> 02:03:12.380
<v Speaker 5>That's important.</v>

5048
02:03:12.380 --> 02:03:13.213
<v Speaker 5>That's actually,</v>

5049
02:03:13.570 --> 02:03:14.011
<v Speaker 5>let me see.</v>

5050
02:03:14.011 --> 02:03:15.270
<v Speaker 5>That was actually kind of those,</v>

5051
02:03:15.271 --> 02:03:15.481
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

5052
02:03:15.481 --> 02:03:16.314
<v Speaker 5>that's about it.</v>

5053
02:03:16.350 --> 02:03:18.750
<v Speaker 5>Did that happen before it was ever a girl was like,</v>

5054
02:03:18.751 --> 02:03:19.670
<v Speaker 5>I can't do this or what's,</v>

5055
02:03:19.671 --> 02:03:20.880
<v Speaker 5>she wasn't like me or the mountain,</v>

5056
02:03:20.881 --> 02:03:21.211
<v Speaker 5>but yeah.</v>

5057
02:03:21.211 --> 02:03:22.560
<v Speaker 5>I mean those are basically the issues.</v>

5058
02:03:22.780 --> 02:03:23.970
<v Speaker 5>Like you're way too much.</v>

5059
02:03:23.971 --> 02:03:25.440
<v Speaker 5>You're not like involved in or whatever.</v>

5060
02:03:25.950 --> 02:03:26.783
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

5061
02:03:27.460 --> 02:03:28.293
<v Speaker 1>So it was that way.</v>

5062
02:03:28.510 --> 02:03:29.081
<v Speaker 1>So it was chicks.</v>

5063
02:03:29.081 --> 02:03:29.481
<v Speaker 1>They want you,</v>

5064
02:03:29.481 --> 02:03:30.314
<v Speaker 1>they're greedy.</v>

5065
02:03:30.360 --> 02:03:30.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5066
02:03:30.910 --> 02:03:31.960
<v Speaker 1>Once you give them some good deck,</v>

5067
02:03:31.990 --> 02:03:32.830
<v Speaker 1>they want you all the time.</v>

5068
02:03:33.290 --> 02:03:34.123
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that was,</v>

5069
02:03:34.510 --> 02:03:35.291
<v Speaker 5>and it wasn't a problem.</v>

5070
02:03:35.291 --> 02:03:36.124
<v Speaker 5>It's probably not</v>

5071
02:03:39.250 --> 02:03:40.083
<v Speaker 5>your best though.</v>

5072
02:03:40.090 --> 02:03:41.110
<v Speaker 5>I was trying super hard.</v>

5073
02:03:41.800 --> 02:03:42.633
<v Speaker 5>Super hard.</v>

5074
02:03:42.940 --> 02:03:43.773
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for being honest.</v>

5075
02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:45.361
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>

5076
02:03:45.361 --> 02:03:45.971
<v Speaker 1>cat dude,</v>

5077
02:03:45.971 --> 02:03:46.870
<v Speaker 1>you're a fascinating guy.</v>

5078
02:03:46.900 --> 02:03:47.071
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

5079
02:03:47.071 --> 02:03:47.561
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

5080
02:03:47.561 --> 02:03:48.070
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

5081
02:03:48.070 --> 02:03:50.860
<v Speaker 1>I think what you're doing is really a very unusual,</v>

5082
02:03:50.861 --> 02:03:51.091
<v Speaker 1>and I'm,</v>

5083
02:03:51.091 --> 02:03:51.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

5084
02:03:51.340 --> 02:03:54.940
<v Speaker 1>I'm always glad when I meet someone who's doing something completely different,</v>

5085
02:03:55.260 --> 02:03:55.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5086
02:03:55.580 --> 02:03:56.700
<v Speaker 1>different than me or,</v>

5087
02:03:56.701 --> 02:03:56.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5088
02:03:56.890 --> 02:04:00.640
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the coolest things about this podcast is that we can sit down with</v>

5089
02:04:00.641 --> 02:04:01.091
<v Speaker 1>people that,</v>

5090
02:04:01.091 --> 02:04:01.300
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

5091
02:04:01.300 --> 02:04:02.920
<v Speaker 1>I probably would never meet you in real life.</v>

5092
02:04:02.950 --> 02:04:03.190
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

5093
02:04:03.190 --> 02:04:04.540
<v Speaker 1>maybe we exchange emails.</v>

5094
02:04:04.541 --> 02:04:05.290
<v Speaker 1>We have a little,</v>

5095
02:04:05.290 --> 02:04:08.950
<v Speaker 1>to be able to sit down face to face with you and have a certain conversation for</v>

5096
02:04:08.951 --> 02:04:09.491
<v Speaker 1>whatever reason,</v>

5097
02:04:09.491 --> 02:04:12.010
<v Speaker 1>it only exists because of a medium to display it.</v>

5098
02:04:12.040 --> 02:04:12.480
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

5099
02:04:12.480 --> 02:04:12.670
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

5100
02:04:12.670 --> 02:04:13.840
<v Speaker 1>it's really interesting.</v>

5101
02:04:14.290 --> 02:04:14.791
<v Speaker 1>I think it's,</v>

5102
02:04:14.791 --> 02:04:15.520
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

5103
02:04:15.520 --> 02:04:17.260
<v Speaker 1>it's just important,</v>

5104
02:04:17.261 --> 02:04:20.410
<v Speaker 1>I think for a human being to realize that there's a lot of different ways to be</v>

5105
02:04:20.411 --> 02:04:21.244
<v Speaker 1>a person.</v>

5106
02:04:21.310 --> 02:04:23.320
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of different people out there,</v>

5107
02:04:23.500 --> 02:04:23.741
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5108
02:04:23.741 --> 02:04:27.850
<v Speaker 1>you probably would not be happy if you were a singer in a band,</v>

5109
02:04:28.230 --> 02:04:29.063
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5110
02:04:29.190 --> 02:04:30.023
<v Speaker 1>horrible.</v>

5111
02:04:30.230 --> 02:04:32.290
<v Speaker 5>Nobody else would be happy either if be like,</v>

5112
02:04:32.291 --> 02:04:33.124
<v Speaker 5>oh no,</v>

5113
02:04:33.280 --> 02:04:34.113
<v Speaker 5>but you know what I'm saying?</v>

5114
02:04:34.510 --> 02:04:35.343
<v Speaker 5>That's their dream.</v>

5115
02:04:35.350 --> 02:04:37.060
<v Speaker 5>They're in front of the mirror with a hairbrush.</v>

5116
02:04:37.270 --> 02:04:38.103
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

5117
02:04:38.350 --> 02:04:39.131
<v Speaker 5>it's funny you say that.</v>

5118
02:04:39.131 --> 02:04:40.390
<v Speaker 5>Like I actually,</v>

5119
02:04:40.391 --> 02:04:42.800
<v Speaker 5>I got invited to speak at my old high school to a,</v>

5120
02:04:42.820 --> 02:04:45.330
<v Speaker 5>to tell the kids I was don't climb rocks.</v>

5121
02:04:45.350 --> 02:04:48.880
<v Speaker 5>And I was in gifted and talented type program where everybody goes and becomes a</v>

5122
02:04:48.881 --> 02:04:49.714
<v Speaker 5>doctor or whatever.</v>

5123
02:04:49.930 --> 02:04:50.740
<v Speaker 5>And um,</v>

5124
02:04:50.740 --> 02:04:53.110
<v Speaker 5>they invited me there to speak to tell the kids that they don't have to go to</v>

5125
02:04:53.111 --> 02:04:53.530
<v Speaker 5>college,</v>

5126
02:04:53.530 --> 02:04:56.440
<v Speaker 5>that if they want they can just go and live their dream and do their thing and</v>

5127
02:04:56.441 --> 02:04:56.950
<v Speaker 5>whatever.</v>

5128
02:04:56.950 --> 02:04:59.800
<v Speaker 5>So it was actually a super satisfying for me to go back to my old high school.</v>

5129
02:04:59.801 --> 02:05:00.634
<v Speaker 5>It'd be like</v>

5130
02:05:02.240 --> 02:05:02.650
<v Speaker 5>marijuana,</v>

5131
02:05:02.650 --> 02:05:04.750
<v Speaker 5>just like a high school in Sacramento.</v>

5132
02:05:05.360 --> 02:05:06.160
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

5133
02:05:06.160 --> 02:05:07.370
<v Speaker 5>What a cool program mean.</v>

5134
02:05:07.570 --> 02:05:07.820
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

5135
02:05:07.820 --> 02:05:09.070
<v Speaker 5>it's the international baccalaureate.</v>

5136
02:05:09.071 --> 02:05:10.210
<v Speaker 5>It's kind of like AP program,</v>

5137
02:05:10.211 --> 02:05:11.140
<v Speaker 5>but kind of like high end,</v>

5138
02:05:11.141 --> 02:05:12.220
<v Speaker 5>like you know,</v>

5139
02:05:12.310 --> 02:05:13.210
<v Speaker 5>academic program.</v>

5140
02:05:13.270 --> 02:05:13.991
<v Speaker 5>So this is,</v>

5141
02:05:13.991 --> 02:05:14.410
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

5142
02:05:14.410 --> 02:05:15.820
<v Speaker 5>not specific to that area.</v>

5143
02:05:15.821 --> 02:05:18.100
<v Speaker 5>This is a national program where the program is national,</v>

5144
02:05:18.101 --> 02:05:20.380
<v Speaker 5>but the one that is in that specific high school,</v>

5145
02:05:20.381 --> 02:05:22.750
<v Speaker 5>it's like quite good and they do really well nationally and everything.</v>

5146
02:05:22.751 --> 02:05:23.500
<v Speaker 5>And so,</v>

5147
02:05:23.500 --> 02:05:23.950
<v Speaker 5>and it's,</v>

5148
02:05:23.950 --> 02:05:24.191
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5149
02:05:24.191 --> 02:05:25.150
<v Speaker 5>it's just where I went to high school,</v>

5150
02:05:25.151 --> 02:05:28.300
<v Speaker 5>but so one of my old teachers ask me to come back and tell the kids that like,</v>

5151
02:05:28.600 --> 02:05:28.811
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5152
02:05:28.811 --> 02:05:31.030
<v Speaker 5>even though your parents are expecting you to become a doctor,</v>

5153
02:05:31.040 --> 02:05:33.310
<v Speaker 5>like you don't have to like you can just follow your dream,</v>

5154
02:05:33.311 --> 02:05:34.061
<v Speaker 5>travel the world,</v>

5155
02:05:34.061 --> 02:05:34.960
<v Speaker 5>do what you love to do,</v>

5156
02:05:34.990 --> 02:05:35.823
<v Speaker 5>that kind of thing.</v>

5157
02:05:36.040 --> 02:05:36.431
<v Speaker 5>It was like,</v>

5158
02:05:36.431 --> 02:05:38.740
<v Speaker 5>it was very satisfying to go back and like have that talk,</v>

5159
02:05:38.741 --> 02:05:38.981
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5160
02:05:38.981 --> 02:05:40.900
<v Speaker 5>after having gone through the program and been like,</v>

5161
02:05:40.930 --> 02:05:42.190
<v Speaker 5>oh I need to go to university.</v>

5162
02:05:42.191 --> 02:05:44.110
<v Speaker 5>I got to get my degree know it'd be like,</v>

5163
02:05:44.111 --> 02:05:45.040
<v Speaker 5>you know what I mean?</v>

5164
02:05:45.070 --> 02:05:46.470
<v Speaker 5>I mean I think that's great and I think I,</v>

5165
02:05:46.471 --> 02:05:47.920
<v Speaker 5>and I really value education,</v>

5166
02:05:47.921 --> 02:05:48.754
<v Speaker 5>but like,</v>

5167
02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:49.301
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5168
02:05:49.301 --> 02:05:50.740
<v Speaker 5>sometimes you just kind of do what you love to do.</v>

5169
02:05:50.940 --> 02:05:51.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5170
02:05:51.090 --> 02:05:52.290
<v Speaker 1>I value education as well,</v>

5171
02:05:52.291 --> 02:05:55.380
<v Speaker 1>but I completely agree with you and I had the same issues coming out of high</v>

5172
02:05:55.381 --> 02:05:55.711
<v Speaker 1>school.</v>

5173
02:05:55.711 --> 02:05:58.500
<v Speaker 1>I went to college just so that people didn't think I was a loser.</v>

5174
02:05:58.620 --> 02:05:58.801
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5175
02:05:58.801 --> 02:05:59.311
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

5176
02:05:59.311 --> 02:06:00.070
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

5177
02:06:00.070 --> 02:06:03.210
<v Speaker 1>It was really all I was competing in taekwondo tournament's back then.</v>

5178
02:06:03.211 --> 02:06:04.950
<v Speaker 1>There was obviously no money in that either.</v>

5179
02:06:04.980 --> 02:06:06.990
<v Speaker 1>But that's all I wanted to do.</v>

5180
02:06:07.020 --> 02:06:09.510
<v Speaker 1>And so I had to figure out some way to not be a loser.</v>

5181
02:06:09.570 --> 02:06:12.090
<v Speaker 1>So I started going to college while I was doing it.</v>

5182
02:06:12.120 --> 02:06:12.631
<v Speaker 1>Oh it was doing,</v>

5183
02:06:12.631 --> 02:06:13.680
<v Speaker 1>it's fucking up my training.</v>

5184
02:06:14.050 --> 02:06:17.490
<v Speaker 1>Just taking away time that I could be napping instead of that I could be</v>

5185
02:06:17.510 --> 02:06:17.910
<v Speaker 1>napping.</v>

5186
02:06:17.910 --> 02:06:19.080
<v Speaker 1>When when you train that hard,</v>

5187
02:06:19.930 --> 02:06:24.810
<v Speaker 1>when you training for taekwondo tournament especially that's like I didn't party</v>

5188
02:06:24.811 --> 02:06:26.080
<v Speaker 1>at all when I was in high school.</v>

5189
02:06:26.110 --> 02:06:28.650
<v Speaker 1>I didn't do and do it a couple of times.</v>

5190
02:06:28.650 --> 02:06:30.480
<v Speaker 1>Randomly gotten drunk at a party,</v>

5191
02:06:30.481 --> 02:06:32.100
<v Speaker 1>like over my entire high school career.</v>

5192
02:06:32.570 --> 02:06:34.830
<v Speaker 1>Maybe smoked pot like twice or something like that.</v>

5193
02:06:35.100 --> 02:06:38.480
<v Speaker 1>But for the most part throughout high school I was terrified that I was going to</v>

5194
02:06:38.481 --> 02:06:40.290
<v Speaker 1>get killed in a tournament and smashed.</v>

5195
02:06:40.500 --> 02:06:43.920
<v Speaker 1>So all I was doing it was just like eating healthy and drinking water and you</v>

5196
02:06:43.921 --> 02:06:44.041
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

5197
02:06:44.041 --> 02:06:47.490
<v Speaker 1>try to sleep as much as possible and written and training like a demon.</v>

5198
02:06:47.790 --> 02:06:52.230
<v Speaker 1>So I went to that feeling of like being out of high school and like,</v>

5199
02:06:52.290 --> 02:06:52.801
<v Speaker 1>this is no,</v>

5200
02:06:52.801 --> 02:06:53.820
<v Speaker 1>there's no future in this.</v>

5201
02:06:53.821 --> 02:06:54.091
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

5202
02:06:54.091 --> 02:06:54.720
<v Speaker 1>what is this?</v>

5203
02:06:54.720 --> 02:06:55.321
<v Speaker 1>What am I doing?</v>

5204
02:06:55.321 --> 02:06:56.300
<v Speaker 1>Like this obsession,</v>

5205
02:06:56.310 --> 02:06:57.210
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't go anywhere.</v>

5206
02:06:57.540 --> 02:06:59.070
<v Speaker 1>It eventually worked out though.</v>

5207
02:06:59.140 --> 02:07:00.420
<v Speaker 1>That's an exactly.</v>

5208
02:07:00.570 --> 02:07:02.670
<v Speaker 1>But the feeling that I had,</v>

5209
02:07:02.671 --> 02:07:05.100
<v Speaker 1>that feeling of uncertainty was,</v>

5210
02:07:05.101 --> 02:07:05.710
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

5211
02:07:05.710 --> 02:07:06.151
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

5212
02:07:06.151 --> 02:07:09.210
<v Speaker 1>I think it's so important to let other people know that you had that same</v>

5213
02:07:09.211 --> 02:07:09.631
<v Speaker 1>feeling.</v>

5214
02:07:09.631 --> 02:07:13.350
<v Speaker 1>It's so important to do what you did and get in front of his kids and go,</v>

5215
02:07:13.351 --> 02:07:14.184
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

5216
02:07:14.220 --> 02:07:16.890
<v Speaker 1>nobody has a map of where the fuck you're supposed to go.</v>

5217
02:07:17.250 --> 02:07:18.480
<v Speaker 1>You could go anywhere.</v>

5218
02:07:18.510 --> 02:07:20.100
<v Speaker 1>And there's a lot of different ways to make a living.</v>

5219
02:07:20.101 --> 02:07:20.341
<v Speaker 1>And if,</v>

5220
02:07:20.341 --> 02:07:22.470
<v Speaker 1>and if you see someone who's doing something,</v>

5221
02:07:22.620 --> 02:07:26.760
<v Speaker 1>whether they're an author or a painter or they're flying planes,</v>

5222
02:07:26.910 --> 02:07:27.960
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is,</v>

5223
02:07:27.961 --> 02:07:29.280
<v Speaker 1>if someone's doing it,</v>

5224
02:07:29.520 --> 02:07:30.660
<v Speaker 1>you can do it too.</v>

5225
02:07:31.380 --> 02:07:32.340
<v Speaker 1>It can be done</v>

5226
02:07:32.550 --> 02:07:33.500
<v Speaker 5>or you can do your own,</v>

5227
02:07:33.501 --> 02:07:34.051
<v Speaker 5>but he's doing it,</v>

5228
02:07:34.051 --> 02:07:34.341
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5229
02:07:34.341 --> 02:07:35.230
<v Speaker 5>you have no one's doing it.</v>

5230
02:07:35.231 --> 02:07:35.741
<v Speaker 5>You can be like,</v>

5231
02:07:35.741 --> 02:07:36.160
<v Speaker 5>that</v>

5232
02:07:36.160 --> 02:07:37.630
<v Speaker 3>is what I want to do and God it,</v>

5233
02:07:37.631 --> 02:07:38.240
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to do it.</v>

5234
02:07:38.240 --> 02:07:39.400
<v Speaker 3>As long as it's logical,</v>

5235
02:07:39.440 --> 02:07:42.430
<v Speaker 3>unless someone needed to take you to a doctor until you're fucking crazy,</v>

5236
02:07:42.530 --> 02:07:43.600
<v Speaker 3>you can't actually fly.</v>

5237
02:07:44.150 --> 02:07:44.550
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

5238
02:07:44.550 --> 02:07:45.383
<v Speaker 3>There's a little of that.</v>

5239
02:07:45.740 --> 02:07:46.480
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5240
02:07:46.480 --> 02:07:47.410
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

5241
02:07:47.770 --> 02:07:50.030
<v Speaker 3>all extreme examples of it's,</v>

5242
02:07:50.050 --> 02:07:51.610
<v Speaker 3>I think it's so important to do that.</v>

5243
02:07:51.740 --> 02:07:52.130
<v Speaker 3>It's so,</v>

5244
02:07:52.130 --> 02:07:53.980
<v Speaker 3>so important to give kids.</v>

5245
02:07:54.370 --> 02:07:54.611
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

5246
02:07:54.611 --> 02:07:59.080
<v Speaker 3>how many times in your life have you seen something that was inspiring that sort</v>

5247
02:07:59.081 --> 02:08:01.750
<v Speaker 3>of like pushed you and they give you like this,</v>

5248
02:08:01.751 --> 02:08:03.250
<v Speaker 3>this feeling of confidence.</v>

5249
02:08:03.251 --> 02:08:03.730
<v Speaker 3>Like it was like,</v>

5250
02:08:03.730 --> 02:08:05.020
<v Speaker 3>Oh okay that guy did that.</v>

5251
02:08:05.290 --> 02:08:07.050
<v Speaker 3>God that this world is Kinda nutty.</v>

5252
02:08:07.090 --> 02:08:09.580
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of different shit.</v>

5253
02:08:09.880 --> 02:08:12.560
<v Speaker 3>I think a guy like you is like a really important example that,</v>

5254
02:08:13.530 --> 02:08:14.363
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

5255
02:08:14.480 --> 02:08:14.950
<v Speaker 3>Maybe.</v>

5256
02:08:14.950 --> 02:08:16.750
<v Speaker 3>What did it feel like to do that speech?</v>

5257
02:08:16.751 --> 02:08:17.584
<v Speaker 3>Did you shit your pants?</v>

5258
02:08:19.120 --> 02:08:19.391
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

5259
02:08:19.391 --> 02:08:20.410
<v Speaker 3>I'm talking to high school games.</v>

5260
02:08:20.420 --> 02:08:20.741
<v Speaker 3>I can't,</v>

5261
02:08:20.741 --> 02:08:21.191
<v Speaker 3>it's not a,</v>

5262
02:08:21.191 --> 02:08:22.240
<v Speaker 3>you can't be that nervous.</v>

5263
02:08:22.580 --> 02:08:22.840
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

5264
02:08:22.840 --> 02:08:27.010
<v Speaker 3>they're all like 16 and I'll try and get laid except they're never going to,</v>

5265
02:08:27.011 --> 02:08:29.220
<v Speaker 3>cause they're all like little girl nerds.</v>

5266
02:08:29.280 --> 02:08:29.860
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5267
02:08:29.860 --> 02:08:32.170
<v Speaker 3>That's what Brian comes in Florence.</v>

5268
02:08:32.180 --> 02:08:33.790
<v Speaker 3>So long as they're willing to do this on film,</v>

5269
02:08:33.791 --> 02:08:34.624
<v Speaker 3>we can get them all ready.</v>

5270
02:08:35.450 --> 02:08:36.550
<v Speaker 3>It is not a problem.</v>

5271
02:08:36.551 --> 02:08:38.860
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that's really the school to recruit for uh,</v>

5272
02:08:39.060 --> 02:08:39.760
<v Speaker 3>for porn.</v>

5273
02:08:39.760 --> 02:08:40.150
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

5274
02:08:40.150 --> 02:08:44.530
<v Speaker 3>See you say that but say all want to get laid so I don't see what you're saying.</v>

5275
02:08:44.560 --> 02:08:46.540
<v Speaker 3>As long as their penises and vaginas work,</v>

5276
02:08:46.570 --> 02:08:48.010
<v Speaker 3>I think we've got a problem there.</v>

5277
02:08:48.060 --> 02:08:48.480
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5278
02:08:48.480 --> 02:08:49.313
<v Speaker 3>And we could solve it,</v>

5279
02:08:50.680 --> 02:08:51.220
<v Speaker 3>right Brian?</v>

5280
02:08:51.220 --> 02:08:52.053
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

5281
02:08:53.500 --> 02:08:57.340
<v Speaker 3>That could be something that could derail a of the career of an inspiring person</v>

5282
02:08:57.341 --> 02:08:59.710
<v Speaker 3>though he had too much high end pussy at a young age.</v>

5283
02:09:00.110 --> 02:09:01.840
<v Speaker 3>It's like winning the lottery,</v>

5284
02:09:02.080 --> 02:09:02.800
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

5285
02:09:02.800 --> 02:09:04.360
<v Speaker 3>Cause if you won the lottery you like,</v>

5286
02:09:04.361 --> 02:09:05.230
<v Speaker 3>why would I work?</v>

5287
02:09:05.231 --> 02:09:07.520
<v Speaker 3>Why would I be inspired to go do things right?</v>

5288
02:09:07.530 --> 02:09:08.080
<v Speaker 3>And I totally like,</v>

5289
02:09:08.080 --> 02:09:09.040
<v Speaker 3>I have this free money,</v>

5290
02:09:09.041 --> 02:09:10.700
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to play Xbox until I die.</v>

5291
02:09:10.730 --> 02:09:11.320
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5292
02:09:11.320 --> 02:09:12.550
<v Speaker 3>It can kill motivation.</v>

5293
02:09:12.940 --> 02:09:16.330
<v Speaker 3>I think that also can happen if you fuck above your head at a young age.</v>

5294
02:09:16.890 --> 02:09:18.690
<v Speaker 3>I never had that problem ruin you.</v>

5295
02:09:18.750 --> 02:09:19.960
<v Speaker 3>Still extremely motivated.</v>

5296
02:09:21.730 --> 02:09:24.580
<v Speaker 3>It can ruin you if you've got a hold of some terror.</v>

5297
02:09:24.581 --> 02:09:25.630
<v Speaker 3>Patrick type chick.</v>

5298
02:09:25.631 --> 02:09:26.920
<v Speaker 3>When you were 18 years old,</v>

5299
02:09:26.960 --> 02:09:28.270
<v Speaker 3>you really think you could survive that.</v>

5300
02:09:28.720 --> 02:09:29.441
<v Speaker 3>That guy would wreck you.</v>

5301
02:09:29.441 --> 02:09:30.520
<v Speaker 3>That would be all you would think about.</v>

5302
02:09:30.521 --> 02:09:35.000
<v Speaker 3>You'd be on those climbing peaks and instead of thinking of your next foot hold,</v>

5303
02:09:35.001 --> 02:09:38.620
<v Speaker 3>you'd be thinking of her mouth on your and your penis and then you could get</v>

5304
02:09:38.621 --> 02:09:39.610
<v Speaker 3>really problematic.</v>

5305
02:09:40.090 --> 02:09:40.930
<v Speaker 3>It wouldn't be focused,</v>

5306
02:09:40.931 --> 02:09:42.250
<v Speaker 3>he wouldn't keep your eyes on the prize.</v>

5307
02:09:42.790 --> 02:09:46.360
<v Speaker 3>The thrill of getting to the top but somehow or another beat dwarfed by the</v>

5308
02:09:46.361 --> 02:09:47.290
<v Speaker 3>thrill of her mouth.</v>

5309
02:09:47.291 --> 02:09:47.990
<v Speaker 3>By the fee.</v>

5310
02:09:47.990 --> 02:09:48.550
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5311
02:09:48.550 --> 02:09:51.370
<v Speaker 3>The memory of the thrill of that knowledge that you know,</v>

5312
02:09:51.371 --> 02:09:54.170
<v Speaker 3>all you have to do is get in the same room with her and shut the door and you'll</v>

5313
02:09:54.190 --> 02:09:55.420
<v Speaker 3>be having sex with her.</v>

5314
02:09:55.840 --> 02:09:56.770
<v Speaker 3>Is that all it takes?</v>

5315
02:09:56.860 --> 02:09:57.700
<v Speaker 3>No frigging.</v>

5316
02:09:57.710 --> 02:09:58.990
<v Speaker 3>Before she was your girlfriend?</v>

5317
02:10:00.480 --> 02:10:01.660
<v Speaker 3>I think she's actually married now.</v>

5318
02:10:02.140 --> 02:10:05.230
<v Speaker 3>I didn't use her and exists as an example because she has loose morals.</v>

5319
02:10:05.560 --> 02:10:06.940
<v Speaker 3>Just exactly hot.</v>

5320
02:10:07.720 --> 02:10:08.440
<v Speaker 3>She's very nice.</v>

5321
02:10:08.440 --> 02:10:08.651
<v Speaker 3>Great.</v>

5322
02:10:08.651 --> 02:10:09.200
<v Speaker 3>Next person.</v>

5323
02:10:09.200 --> 02:10:09.550
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

5324
02:10:09.550 --> 02:10:10.240
<v Speaker 3>we've uh,</v>

5325
02:10:10.240 --> 02:10:10.980
<v Speaker 3>we've met before.</v>

5326
02:10:10.980 --> 02:10:11.620
<v Speaker 3>It's really nice,</v>

5327
02:10:11.620 --> 02:10:12.161
<v Speaker 3>but she's married.</v>

5328
02:10:12.161 --> 02:10:13.000
<v Speaker 3>She's got a baby and everything,</v>

5329
02:10:13.030 --> 02:10:14.100
<v Speaker 3>so I don't think you can fuck her up,</v>

5330
02:10:14.110 --> 02:10:16.660
<v Speaker 3>but I'm saying if you did when you were 18 yeah,</v>

5331
02:10:16.661 --> 02:10:18.940
<v Speaker 3>it'd be a disaster for your future productivity.</v>

5332
02:10:19.120 --> 02:10:19.631
<v Speaker 3>It could be,</v>

5333
02:10:19.631 --> 02:10:19.951
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

5334
02:10:19.951 --> 02:10:20.350
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5335
02:10:20.350 --> 02:10:23.770
<v Speaker 3>How do you jerk off when you're in a tent and it's like you're,</v>

5336
02:10:23.780 --> 02:10:24.790
<v Speaker 3>you're in the middle of nowhere.</v>

5337
02:10:24.791 --> 02:10:25.440
<v Speaker 3>I like,</v>

5338
02:10:25.440 --> 02:10:27.040
<v Speaker 3>did you just save it until you get,</v>

5339
02:10:27.190 --> 02:10:32.190
<v Speaker 3>get back to civilization then you do the same thing you do at home in a tent out</v>

5340
02:10:32.261 --> 02:10:33.094
<v Speaker 3>there hiking?</v>

5341
02:10:33.290 --> 02:10:33.481
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5342
02:10:33.481 --> 02:10:34.240
<v Speaker 3>I mean why not?</v>

5343
02:10:34.240 --> 02:10:35.660
<v Speaker 3>I don't think a joke often tense.</v>

5344
02:10:36.050 --> 02:10:36.711
<v Speaker 3>As I say,</v>

5345
02:10:36.711 --> 02:10:37.460
<v Speaker 3>it's waterproof.</v>

5346
02:10:37.460 --> 02:10:40.250
<v Speaker 3>If you lived in a tent or confident 10 yeah.</v>

5347
02:10:40.490 --> 02:10:40.671
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

5348
02:10:40.671 --> 02:10:41.151
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>

5349
02:10:41.151 --> 02:10:42.260
<v Speaker 3>It gets to a certain point where you're like,</v>

5350
02:10:42.261 --> 02:10:42.471
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

5351
02:10:42.471 --> 02:10:45.440
<v Speaker 3>I've got to just do this just for maintenance for sure.</v>

5352
02:10:45.441 --> 02:10:46.460
<v Speaker 3>You've got to keep the pipes clean,</v>

5353
02:10:46.520 --> 02:10:47.350
<v Speaker 3>but it's all,</v>

5354
02:10:47.350 --> 02:10:47.620
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

5355
02:10:47.620 --> 02:10:48.650
<v Speaker 3>it's all on memory.</v>

5356
02:10:48.830 --> 02:10:50.960
<v Speaker 3>Do you bring like porn on a phone or something like that?</v>

5357
02:10:50.961 --> 02:10:51.794
<v Speaker 3>Set it up.</v>

5358
02:10:52.690 --> 02:10:55.360
<v Speaker 3>Memory is kind of the way I think or drawling it.</v>

5359
02:10:56.360 --> 02:10:57.320
<v Speaker 3>Kate fadings.</v>

5360
02:10:58.910 --> 02:11:00.740
<v Speaker 3>Have there ever been pornographic cave paintings?</v>

5361
02:11:00.810 --> 02:11:01.643
<v Speaker 3>If her phone,</v>

5362
02:11:01.880 --> 02:11:02.800
<v Speaker 3>I sure there must be.</v>

5363
02:11:02.840 --> 02:11:02.990
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

5364
02:11:02.990 --> 02:11:03.740
<v Speaker 3>I mean porn.</v>

5365
02:11:03.740 --> 02:11:04.573
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5366
02:11:04.640 --> 02:11:05.473
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5367
02:11:05.600 --> 02:11:09.500
<v Speaker 3>It's interesting the idea that these cave paintings represented reality cause</v>

5368
02:11:09.501 --> 02:11:11.090
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of weird shit that they drew.</v>

5369
02:11:11.120 --> 02:11:16.120
<v Speaker 3>Then like you know a lot of us ufologists and big foot people look to as proof</v>

5370
02:11:17.300 --> 02:11:19.040
<v Speaker 3>of the fact these people experienced here.</v>

5371
02:11:20.600 --> 02:11:22.830
<v Speaker 3>Imagine if you looked at all of human arteries.</v>

5372
02:11:23.030 --> 02:11:23.420
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5373
02:11:23.420 --> 02:11:24.080
<v Speaker 3>Sketchy.</v>

5374
02:11:24.080 --> 02:11:24.913
<v Speaker 3>Sketchy.</v>

5375
02:11:25.220 --> 02:11:27.670
<v Speaker 3>So like so like you know what,</v>

5376
02:11:27.680 --> 02:11:30.320
<v Speaker 3>there was a real Mickey mouse like Mickey mouse and drill because there's a</v>

5377
02:11:30.321 --> 02:11:31.280
<v Speaker 3>drawing of Mickey Mouse.</v>

5378
02:11:31.281 --> 02:11:32.360
<v Speaker 3>Like that doesn't make any sense.</v>

5379
02:11:32.660 --> 02:11:35.390
<v Speaker 3>Like there was these guys I watched finding big foot.</v>

5380
02:11:35.570 --> 02:11:38.600
<v Speaker 3>We've had the bigfoot hunter Bobo on the show before.</v>

5381
02:11:38.840 --> 02:11:40.310
<v Speaker 3>Fascinating conversation.</v>

5382
02:11:40.960 --> 02:11:41.600
<v Speaker 3>It's the budget.</v>

5383
02:11:41.600 --> 02:11:43.250
<v Speaker 3>He's like honestly hunting big foot.</v>

5384
02:11:43.490 --> 02:11:44.323
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

5385
02:11:44.360 --> 02:11:47.020
<v Speaker 3>I mean he's legit in the sense that he's honestly honey big foot.</v>

5386
02:11:48.170 --> 02:11:48.561
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

5387
02:11:48.561 --> 02:11:50.450
<v Speaker 3>He believes he's had experiences.</v>

5388
02:11:50.800 --> 02:11:51.500
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5389
02:11:51.500 --> 02:11:52.333
<v Speaker 3>Is he a Weirdo?</v>

5390
02:11:52.610 --> 02:11:53.480
<v Speaker 3>This is a little weird.</v>

5391
02:11:53.540 --> 02:11:53.841
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5392
02:11:53.841 --> 02:11:55.760
<v Speaker 3>He could benefit from Brian's program as well.</v>

5393
02:11:56.240 --> 02:11:57.073
<v Speaker 3>Prize</v>

5394
02:11:58.940 --> 02:11:59.860
<v Speaker 3>Brian's up,</v>

5395
02:12:01.640 --> 02:12:02.270
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

5396
02:12:02.270 --> 02:12:03.080
<v Speaker 3>He's a,</v>

5397
02:12:03.080 --> 02:12:03.620
<v Speaker 3>but he's,</v>

5398
02:12:03.620 --> 02:12:07.730
<v Speaker 3>his life is dedicated to finding Sasquatch apparently saw it once or twice or</v>

5399
02:12:07.731 --> 02:12:08.361
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

5400
02:12:08.361 --> 02:12:12.350
<v Speaker 3>And it's been going on these expeditions and they go looking for places where,</v>

5401
02:12:12.351 --> 02:12:12.640
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5402
02:12:12.640 --> 02:12:13.190
<v Speaker 3>paypal,</v>

5403
02:12:13.190 --> 02:12:14.023
<v Speaker 3>what's</v>

5404
02:12:15.370 --> 02:12:16.850
<v Speaker 3>lot of fuckery involved.</v>

5405
02:12:16.910 --> 02:12:17.491
<v Speaker 3>But the,</v>

5406
02:12:17.491 --> 02:12:20.570
<v Speaker 3>the reason people keep going is because there was an animal called gigantic</v>

5407
02:12:20.610 --> 02:12:23.060
<v Speaker 3>Pythagoras that lived as recently as a hundred thousand years ago.</v>

5408
02:12:23.070 --> 02:12:23.990
<v Speaker 3>That was an eight foot,</v>

5409
02:12:24.140 --> 02:12:28.300
<v Speaker 3>10 foot tall by Peto primate and enormous Animal Dakota.</v>

5410
02:12:28.340 --> 02:12:30.050
<v Speaker 3>The Co existed with humans,</v>

5411
02:12:30.590 --> 02:12:30.861
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5412
02:12:30.861 --> 02:12:33.050
<v Speaker 3>just like we drew wooly mammoths.</v>

5413
02:12:33.051 --> 02:12:34.190
<v Speaker 3>This is a real animal.</v>

5414
02:12:34.250 --> 02:12:38.000
<v Speaker 3>So when they have these cave paintings and drawings of this big,</v>

5415
02:12:38.030 --> 02:12:38.481
<v Speaker 3>tall,</v>

5416
02:12:38.481 --> 02:12:39.320
<v Speaker 3>hairy thing,</v>

5417
02:12:39.650 --> 02:12:44.630
<v Speaker 3>it may very well have been something that existed and died off because it lived</v>

5418
02:12:44.631 --> 02:12:48.620
<v Speaker 3>in Asia and must much like people came to North America following the Bering</v>

5419
02:12:48.620 --> 02:12:48.620
<v Speaker 3>strait.</v>

5420
02:12:48.620 --> 02:12:49.130
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5421
02:12:49.130 --> 02:12:49.401
<v Speaker 3>It,</v>

5422
02:12:49.401 --> 02:12:49.640
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

5423
02:12:49.640 --> 02:12:51.470
<v Speaker 3>it also could have done the exact same thing.</v>

5424
02:12:52.010 --> 02:12:53.090
<v Speaker 3>They think it's really possible,</v>

5425
02:12:53.091 --> 02:12:55.760
<v Speaker 3>especially because of the density of the forest in the Pacific northwest.</v>

5426
02:12:56.030 --> 02:12:56.421
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

5427
02:12:56.421 --> 02:12:57.081
<v Speaker 3>Jane Goodall,</v>

5428
02:12:57.081 --> 02:12:58.070
<v Speaker 3>the primatologist,</v>

5429
02:12:58.071 --> 02:12:58.730
<v Speaker 3>she,</v>

5430
02:12:58.730 --> 02:13:00.530
<v Speaker 3>she's pretty certain that there's,</v>

5431
02:13:00.560 --> 02:13:01.030
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

5432
02:13:01.030 --> 02:13:01.460
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

5433
02:13:01.460 --> 02:13:02.140
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

5434
02:13:02.140 --> 02:13:05.260
<v Speaker 3>an actual undiscovered primate living in the Pacific northwest.</v>

5435
02:13:05.270 --> 02:13:06.800
<v Speaker 3>She said she believes 100%.</v>

5436
02:13:07.220 --> 02:13:07.521
<v Speaker 3>She said,</v>

5437
02:13:07.521 --> 02:13:07.790
<v Speaker 3>John,</v>

5438
02:13:07.790 --> 02:13:08.810
<v Speaker 3>I'm absolutely certain,</v>

5439
02:13:08.811 --> 02:13:09.321
<v Speaker 3>or something like that.</v>

5440
02:13:09.321 --> 02:13:10.250
<v Speaker 3>I forget her exact quote,</v>

5441
02:13:10.400 --> 02:13:12.710
<v Speaker 3>but I thought coming from a primatologist like her,</v>

5442
02:13:13.190 --> 02:13:14.450
<v Speaker 3>that's something to be considered.</v>

5443
02:13:14.540 --> 02:13:19.340
<v Speaker 3>But it also could be romantic confirmation bias and now she could just be</v>

5444
02:13:19.520 --> 02:13:22.460
<v Speaker 3>psyched about monkeys and hoping there's a big one out there.</v>

5445
02:13:22.461 --> 02:13:23.190
<v Speaker 3>And that's how,</v>

5446
02:13:23.190 --> 02:13:24.950
<v Speaker 3>what finger blast herself to sleep every night.</v>

5447
02:13:24.980 --> 02:13:26.600
<v Speaker 3>Thinking about this big AP in Rio.</v>

5448
02:13:26.601 --> 02:13:27.380
<v Speaker 3>Catch him,</v>

5449
02:13:27.380 --> 02:13:27.980
<v Speaker 3>please.</v>

5450
02:13:27.980 --> 02:13:28.521
<v Speaker 3>Proved me.</v>

5451
02:13:28.521 --> 02:13:29.354
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

5452
02:13:29.420 --> 02:13:30.080
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

5453
02:13:30.080 --> 02:13:30.913
<v Speaker 3>that's how she,</v>

5454
02:13:31.300 --> 02:13:32.050
<v Speaker 3>maybe not,</v>

5455
02:13:32.050 --> 02:13:35.050
<v Speaker 3>I don't think I've ever heard anybody talking about Jane Goodall in a sexual</v>

5456
02:13:35.051 --> 02:13:35.620
<v Speaker 3>sense.</v>

5457
02:13:35.620 --> 02:13:37.450
<v Speaker 3>That's how I got in trouble in science class.</v>

5458
02:13:37.480 --> 02:13:37.900
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

5459
02:13:37.900 --> 02:13:38.531
<v Speaker 3>there was a,</v>

5460
02:13:38.531 --> 02:13:39.080
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

5461
02:13:39.080 --> 02:13:39.700
<v Speaker 3>there was a,</v>

5462
02:13:39.700 --> 02:13:39.961
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

5463
02:13:39.961 --> 02:13:40.930
<v Speaker 3>a woman,</v>

5464
02:13:40.980 --> 02:13:41.320
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

02:13:41.711 --> 02:13:41.861
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

5467
02:13:41.861 --> 02:13:43.430
<v Speaker 3>this science teacher that was a,</v>

5468
02:13:43.900 --> 02:13:47.230
<v Speaker 3>this a kid who was a high school quarterback who was like really smart kid.</v>

5469
02:13:47.380 --> 02:13:48.213
<v Speaker 3>He's very,</v>

5470
02:13:48.250 --> 02:13:51.400
<v Speaker 3>very charming and charismatic and he would flirt with all the teachers to kind</v>

5471
02:13:51.401 --> 02:13:52.510
<v Speaker 3>of try to get better grades.</v>

5472
02:13:52.900 --> 02:13:53.301
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

5473
02:13:53.301 --> 02:13:53.441
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

5474
02:13:53.441 --> 02:13:55.210
<v Speaker 3>I got to class early and,</v>

5475
02:13:55.211 --> 02:13:55.451
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

5476
02:13:55.451 --> 02:13:55.871
<v Speaker 3>I had,</v>

5477
02:13:55.871 --> 02:13:56.040
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

5478
02:13:56.040 --> 02:13:57.370
<v Speaker 3>I drew a picture of him,</v>

5479
02:13:57.371 --> 02:13:58.240
<v Speaker 3>Bang her,</v>

5480
02:13:58.540 --> 02:14:00.220
<v Speaker 3>and she was screaming out,</v>

5481
02:14:00.270 --> 02:14:00.970
<v Speaker 3>do it,</v>

5482
02:14:00.970 --> 02:14:01.571
<v Speaker 3>do it to me.</v>

5483
02:14:01.571 --> 02:14:02.590
<v Speaker 3>Monkey style,</v>

5484
02:14:02.591 --> 02:14:03.251
<v Speaker 3>like my hero,</v>

5485
02:14:03.251 --> 02:14:04.150
<v Speaker 3>Jane Goodall.</v>

5486
02:14:04.510 --> 02:14:08.980
<v Speaker 3>And I like when I got in trouble or that I could see that.</v>

5487
02:14:09.610 --> 02:14:10.000
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

5488
02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:10.400
<v Speaker 3>I got try.</v>

5489
02:14:10.400 --> 02:14:11.010
<v Speaker 3>That's what,</v>

5490
02:14:11.010 --> 02:14:12.250
<v Speaker 3>before I became a comedian,</v>

5491
02:14:12.280 --> 02:14:17.280
<v Speaker 3>most of my comedy ideas were expressed from cartoons because I was sort of a</v>

5492
02:14:17.620 --> 02:14:18.041
<v Speaker 3>drawer.</v>

5493
02:14:18.041 --> 02:14:22.390
<v Speaker 3>I drew an illustrator when I was young and I used to do a lot of comic book type</v>

5494
02:14:22.391 --> 02:14:26.350
<v Speaker 3>stuff and so I would draw like teachers doing something fucked up and get in</v>

5495
02:14:26.351 --> 02:14:27.184
<v Speaker 3>trouble.</v>

5496
02:14:27.670 --> 02:14:28.540
<v Speaker 3>You could do this one teacher,</v>

5497
02:14:28.541 --> 02:14:28.981
<v Speaker 3>she just,</v>

5498
02:14:28.981 --> 02:14:30.790
<v Speaker 3>where a lot of makeups I drove without her makeup,</v>

5499
02:14:30.800 --> 02:14:31.690
<v Speaker 3>but she was a werewolf.</v>

5500
02:14:32.270 --> 02:14:33.400
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking stupid.</v>

5501
02:14:33.820 --> 02:14:34.301
<v Speaker 3>But they got,</v>

5502
02:14:34.301 --> 02:14:35.560
<v Speaker 3>they suspended me for that.</v>

5503
02:14:35.990 --> 02:14:36.410
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

5504
02:14:36.410 --> 02:14:39.430
<v Speaker 3>some shit that you would get on the Internet every day and you would laugh at</v>

5505
02:14:39.431 --> 02:14:39.521
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

5506
02:14:39.521 --> 02:14:41.530
<v Speaker 3>You would l o l l U l.</v>

5507
02:14:41.531 --> 02:14:43.900
<v Speaker 3>Z back in the day.</v>

5508
02:14:43.960 --> 02:14:44.320
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5509
02:14:44.320 --> 02:14:45.153
<v Speaker 3>Back in the day.</v>

5510
02:14:46.180 --> 02:14:47.940
<v Speaker 3>Kinda in trouble faster.</v>

5511
02:14:48.130 --> 02:14:48.351
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

5512
02:14:48.351 --> 02:14:49.480
<v Speaker 3>did you get in trouble at all in high school?</v>

5513
02:14:49.510 --> 02:14:50.343
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

5514
02:14:50.440 --> 02:14:51.250
<v Speaker 3>you're a good kid.</v>

5515
02:14:51.250 --> 02:14:52.081
<v Speaker 3>I never got less than,</v>

5516
02:14:52.081 --> 02:14:52.191
<v Speaker 3>than,</v>

5517
02:14:52.191 --> 02:14:54.610
<v Speaker 3>they never got less than an a in anything.</v>

5518
02:14:54.820 --> 02:14:55.210
<v Speaker 3>Nope.</v>

5519
02:14:55.210 --> 02:14:56.043
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

5520
02:14:56.440 --> 02:14:58.210
<v Speaker 3>I graduate if I get 4.7 or something.</v>

5521
02:14:58.240 --> 02:14:59.080
<v Speaker 3>That's amazing.</v>

5522
02:14:59.120 --> 02:15:03.460
<v Speaker 3>So and you went from there to college and just like this is just not stimulating</v>

5523
02:15:03.461 --> 02:15:04.450
<v Speaker 3>enough and not,</v>

5524
02:15:04.630 --> 02:15:04.860
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

5525
02:15:04.860 --> 02:15:05.681
<v Speaker 3>just wasn't interested,</v>

5526
02:15:05.681 --> 02:15:06.130
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

5527
02:15:06.130 --> 02:15:06.390
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

5528
02:15:06.390 --> 02:15:07.780
<v Speaker 3>It's like I would rather be homeless.</v>

5529
02:15:08.410 --> 02:15:09.280
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

5530
02:15:09.390 --> 02:15:10.223
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5531
02:15:10.570 --> 02:15:14.020
<v Speaker 3>Do you anticipate keeping this lifestyle until you die?</v>

5532
02:15:14.090 --> 02:15:14.621
<v Speaker 3>Traveling,</v>

5533
02:15:14.621 --> 02:15:15.550
<v Speaker 3>living in a van,</v>

5534
02:15:15.580 --> 02:15:16.900
<v Speaker 3>climbing whenever you can?</v>

5535
02:15:17.930 --> 02:15:18.111
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

5536
02:15:18.111 --> 02:15:18.944
<v Speaker 5>Well maybe,</v>

5537
02:15:19.880 --> 02:15:23.000
<v Speaker 5>maybe not the full time travel until I die just because at some point I'm sure I</v>

5538
02:15:23.001 --> 02:15:23.960
<v Speaker 5>wanted to like settle down.</v>

5539
02:15:24.050 --> 02:15:27.950
<v Speaker 5>Do you think you'll ever move up to a mobile home right now?</v>

5540
02:15:27.951 --> 02:15:29.390
<v Speaker 5>I'll probably get a real house at some point.</v>

5541
02:15:29.450 --> 02:15:30.231
<v Speaker 5>At some point in time.</v>

5542
02:15:30.231 --> 02:15:30.530
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

5543
02:15:30.530 --> 02:15:33.440
<v Speaker 5>The thing is it's hard to find a place that I'd want to live full time.</v>

5544
02:15:33.570 --> 02:15:34.403
<v Speaker 5>You ever been in boulder?</v>

5545
02:15:34.670 --> 02:15:34.881
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

5546
02:15:34.881 --> 02:15:35.430
<v Speaker 5>I have.</v>

5547
02:15:35.430 --> 02:15:36.270
<v Speaker 5>The folder is actually,</v>

5548
02:15:36.271 --> 02:15:36.500
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

5549
02:15:36.500 --> 02:15:39.080
<v Speaker 5>That's like the heart of climbing in the u s a bunch of climbing companies are</v>

5550
02:15:39.081 --> 02:15:39.560
<v Speaker 5>based there.</v>

5551
02:15:39.560 --> 02:15:39.951
<v Speaker 5>Is it really?</v>

5552
02:15:39.951 --> 02:15:41.670
<v Speaker 5>And there's so much climbing on the front range there.</v>

5553
02:15:41.680 --> 02:15:42.513
<v Speaker 5>They're like,</v>

5554
02:15:42.620 --> 02:15:42.831
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

5555
02:15:42.831 --> 02:15:43.280
<v Speaker 5>That's like,</v>

5556
02:15:43.280 --> 02:15:44.600
<v Speaker 5>that's the heart of us climbing.</v>

5557
02:15:44.870 --> 02:15:45.130
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

5558
02:15:45.130 --> 02:15:45.501
<v Speaker 5>I was there.</v>

5559
02:15:45.501 --> 02:15:46.334
<v Speaker 5>Someone that died,</v>

5560
02:15:46.550 --> 02:15:49.190
<v Speaker 5>someone fell off one of those flat fitness and elder.</v>

5561
02:15:49.450 --> 02:15:50.750
<v Speaker 5>He's out of Canyon probably.</v>

5562
02:15:50.751 --> 02:15:51.040
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

5563
02:15:51.040 --> 02:15:51.651
<v Speaker 5>it was it people,</v>

5564
02:15:51.651 --> 02:15:53.060
<v Speaker 5>I mean a handful of people die there every year.</v>

5565
02:15:53.060 --> 02:15:53.640
<v Speaker 5>Probably every,</v>

5566
02:15:53.640 --> 02:15:54.180
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

5567
02:15:54.180 --> 02:15:55.013
<v Speaker 5>it seems like it.</v>

5568
02:15:55.490 --> 02:15:56.960
<v Speaker 5>And do you guys look at those people?</v>

5569
02:15:56.980 --> 02:15:58.340
<v Speaker 5>Just people that are just inexperienced,</v>

5570
02:15:58.560 --> 02:16:00.530
<v Speaker 5>shouldn't have January there's a different,</v>

5571
02:16:00.560 --> 02:16:01.281
<v Speaker 5>I mean there's a,</v>

5572
02:16:01.281 --> 02:16:02.690
<v Speaker 5>there's a publication every year,</v>

5573
02:16:02.691 --> 02:16:05.300
<v Speaker 5>accidents in North American mountaineering and it's just a list of every</v>

5574
02:16:05.301 --> 02:16:06.500
<v Speaker 5>accident that happened over the year.</v>

5575
02:16:06.501 --> 02:16:08.660
<v Speaker 5>And they have analysis and causes and you know,</v>

5576
02:16:08.670 --> 02:16:10.190
<v Speaker 5>I mean some accidents you read and you're like,</v>

5577
02:16:10.191 --> 02:16:11.024
<v Speaker 5>what an idiot,</v>

5578
02:16:11.030 --> 02:16:11.720
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5579
02:16:11.720 --> 02:16:12.553
<v Speaker 5>and then some accidents.</v>

5580
02:16:12.650 --> 02:16:13.483
<v Speaker 5>What have you ever read?</v>

5581
02:16:14.480 --> 02:16:14.930
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

5582
02:16:14.930 --> 02:16:15.321
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>

5583
02:16:15.321 --> 02:16:16.700
<v Speaker 5>Like the first thing that comes to mind,</v>

5584
02:16:16.701 --> 02:16:19.670
<v Speaker 5>but I've always found just totally comedic is a odd half dome.</v>

5585
02:16:19.700 --> 02:16:21.980
<v Speaker 5>There's like this long horizontal traverse where like,</v>

5586
02:16:21.981 --> 02:16:23.840
<v Speaker 5>you basically walk across this little tiny ledge.</v>

5587
02:16:23.870 --> 02:16:24.681
<v Speaker 5>It's like the photos.</v>

5588
02:16:24.681 --> 02:16:25.880
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if you've seen any on the internet.</v>

5589
02:16:25.920 --> 02:16:28.370
<v Speaker 5>There's a classic photo of me standing on this little tiny ledge and it looks</v>

5590
02:16:28.371 --> 02:16:29.200
<v Speaker 5>all crazy.</v>

5591
02:16:29.200 --> 02:16:29.381
<v Speaker 5>But,</v>

5592
02:16:29.381 --> 02:16:29.591
<v Speaker 5>so,</v>

5593
02:16:29.591 --> 02:16:30.424
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

5594
02:16:30.670 --> 02:16:34.240
<v Speaker 5>if you don't place protection across the length of the ledge and you fall,</v>

5595
02:16:34.241 --> 02:16:35.710
<v Speaker 5>you're going to just swing like,</v>

5596
02:16:35.770 --> 02:16:36.041
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5597
02:16:36.041 --> 02:16:39.340
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's just like a pendulum straight across and there's a corner at the</v>

5598
02:16:39.341 --> 02:16:39.880
<v Speaker 5>other end of it.</v>

5599
02:16:39.880 --> 02:16:40.960
<v Speaker 5>So if you swing the distance,</v>

5600
02:16:40.961 --> 02:16:44.170
<v Speaker 5>you're just going to swing into this corner and just get totally messed up.</v>

5601
02:16:44.620 --> 02:16:45.011
<v Speaker 5>And so,</v>

5602
02:16:45.011 --> 02:16:45.844
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

5603
02:16:45.880 --> 02:16:46.661
<v Speaker 5>I read an accident,</v>

5604
02:16:46.661 --> 02:16:48.370
<v Speaker 5>it was like a Korean woman climbing,</v>

5605
02:16:48.371 --> 02:16:48.641
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5606
02:16:48.641 --> 02:16:49.780
<v Speaker 5>going big walling or whatever.</v>

5607
02:16:49.781 --> 02:16:53.320
<v Speaker 5>It's like their first wall and she gets up there and she like takes out the</v>

5608
02:16:53.321 --> 02:16:54.190
<v Speaker 5>piece of production is like,</v>

5609
02:16:54.191 --> 02:16:54.401
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

5610
02:16:54.401 --> 02:16:57.030
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to take the swing rather than like crawling across the ledger,</v>

5611
02:16:57.040 --> 02:16:57.281
<v Speaker 5>whatever.</v>

5612
02:16:57.281 --> 02:16:57.791
<v Speaker 5>She's just like,</v>

5613
02:16:57.791 --> 02:16:59.650
<v Speaker 5>takes the swing augers into the corner,</v>

5614
02:16:59.651 --> 02:17:01.660
<v Speaker 5>breaks both their ankles and um,</v>

5615
02:17:02.110 --> 02:17:02.351
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5616
02:17:02.351 --> 02:17:03.184
<v Speaker 5>and you're like,</v>

5617
02:17:03.370 --> 02:17:04.240
<v Speaker 5>what an idiot.</v>

5618
02:17:04.270 --> 02:17:04.511
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

5619
02:17:04.511 --> 02:17:05.291
<v Speaker 5>because it's basically like,</v>

5620
02:17:05.291 --> 02:17:08.260
<v Speaker 5>imagine holding onto a rope swing and looking at a brick wall and being like,</v>

5621
02:17:08.261 --> 02:17:09.700
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to swing into that wall,</v>

5622
02:17:09.730 --> 02:17:10.420
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5623
02:17:10.420 --> 02:17:11.620
<v Speaker 5>with a 90 degree angle.</v>

5624
02:17:11.980 --> 02:17:12.813
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

5625
02:17:12.850 --> 02:17:13.683
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

5626
02:17:13.770 --> 02:17:14.200
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5627
02:17:14.200 --> 02:17:15.820
<v Speaker 5>so you read an accident like that and you're like,</v>

5628
02:17:15.821 --> 02:17:16.870
<v Speaker 5>what was she thinking?</v>

5629
02:17:16.900 --> 02:17:17.800
<v Speaker 5>Because it's like simple,</v>

5630
02:17:17.801 --> 02:17:17.981
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5631
02:17:17.981 --> 02:17:19.180
<v Speaker 5>any kid would be like,</v>

5632
02:17:19.210 --> 02:17:20.500
<v Speaker 5>this looks like it's going to be a terrible,</v>

5633
02:17:22.540 --> 02:17:23.860
<v Speaker 10>I mean it's pretty simple physics,</v>

5634
02:17:24.250 --> 02:17:24.680
<v Speaker 10>you know.</v>

5635
02:17:24.680 --> 02:17:25.350
<v Speaker 10>But then</v>

5636
02:17:25.350 --> 02:17:28.380
<v Speaker 5>at the other end of the spectrum you see accidents where it's just like some</v>

5637
02:17:28.590 --> 02:17:31.740
<v Speaker 5>totally safe family man or something and like,</v>

5638
02:17:31.741 --> 02:17:31.951
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5639
02:17:31.951 --> 02:17:33.390
<v Speaker 5>an ice pillar collapses on him,</v>

5640
02:17:33.391 --> 02:17:34.890
<v Speaker 5>like say when you're climbing or something,</v>

5641
02:17:34.891 --> 02:17:36.540
<v Speaker 5>because that happens a lot when people are ice climbing,</v>

5642
02:17:36.541 --> 02:17:39.290
<v Speaker 5>things just collapse or whatever and you just get hit with ice and you're done.</v>

5643
02:17:39.291 --> 02:17:39.720
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

5644
02:17:39.720 --> 02:17:42.000
<v Speaker 5>Or like rock fall or something or like fricking,</v>

5645
02:17:42.001 --> 02:17:43.830
<v Speaker 5>I'm the head of Nols,</v>

5646
02:17:43.831 --> 02:17:44.191
<v Speaker 5>I think,</v>

5647
02:17:44.191 --> 02:17:45.600
<v Speaker 5>you know the national outdoor leadership school,</v>

5648
02:17:45.601 --> 02:17:46.590
<v Speaker 5>like the outdoor program,</v>

5649
02:17:47.250 --> 02:17:50.880
<v Speaker 5>he was climbing some peak in Montana or Wyoming or somewhere and tourist stuff</v>

5650
02:17:50.881 --> 02:17:51.241
<v Speaker 5>on top.</v>

5651
02:17:51.241 --> 02:17:52.440
<v Speaker 5>We're throwing rocks off the top.</v>

5652
02:17:52.441 --> 02:17:52.711
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

5653
02:17:52.711 --> 02:17:52.891
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

5654
02:17:52.891 --> 02:17:53.724
<v Speaker 5>we're on top.</v>

5655
02:17:53.760 --> 02:17:55.410
<v Speaker 5>And he got hit by a rock and died.</v>

5656
02:17:55.520 --> 02:17:56.353
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

5657
02:17:56.850 --> 02:17:57.990
<v Speaker 5>you hear that kind of an accident.</v>

5658
02:17:57.991 --> 02:17:58.441
<v Speaker 5>And you were like,</v>

5659
02:17:58.441 --> 02:17:59.280
<v Speaker 5>that just sucks.</v>

5660
02:17:59.281 --> 02:18:00.140
<v Speaker 5>Because I mean,</v>

5661
02:18:00.150 --> 02:18:01.710
<v Speaker 5>you feel bad for the dude on top of it too,</v>

5662
02:18:01.711 --> 02:18:02.490
<v Speaker 5>because you're like,</v>

5663
02:18:02.490 --> 02:18:03.140
<v Speaker 5>how could they know?</v>

5664
02:18:03.140 --> 02:18:04.340
<v Speaker 10>And the rock had poop on it.</v>

5665
02:18:04.770 --> 02:18:04.980
<v Speaker 10>Yeah,</v>

5666
02:18:04.980 --> 02:18:05.321
<v Speaker 10>exactly.</v>

5667
02:18:05.321 --> 02:18:06.154
<v Speaker 10>It's a big old rock.</v>

5668
02:18:06.180 --> 02:18:06.681
<v Speaker 10>It's really,</v>

5669
02:18:06.681 --> 02:18:07.550
<v Speaker 10>you're hurling rocks.</v>

5670
02:18:08.230 --> 02:18:09.140
<v Speaker 10>You ever thought about that?</v>

5671
02:18:09.141 --> 02:18:09.591
<v Speaker 10>Good point,</v>

5672
02:18:09.591 --> 02:18:10.070

02:18:10.780 --> 02:18:10.940
<v Speaker 10>no,</v>

5675
02:18:10.940 --> 02:18:11.210
<v Speaker 10>no,</v>

5676
02:18:11.210 --> 02:18:11.511
<v Speaker 10>no.</v>

5677
02:18:11.511 --> 02:18:12.050

02:18:14.420 --> 02:18:15.260
<v Speaker 10>throw my shit.</v>

5682
02:18:15.261 --> 02:18:16.610
<v Speaker 10>And it's attached to a rock.</v>

5683
02:18:16.640 --> 02:18:17.250
<v Speaker 10>Yeah.</v>

5684

<v Speaker 10>Everyone cool with this</v>

5686
02:18:18.720 --> 02:18:19.940
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible] report form to throw rocks.</v>

5687
02:18:19.941 --> 02:18:20.151
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

5688
02:18:20.151 --> 02:18:22.040
<v Speaker 5>shit putting is actually strongly discouraged,</v>

5689
02:18:22.370 --> 02:18:26.000
<v Speaker 5>but like generally that only happens like early morning when you started like</v>

5690
02:18:26.030 --> 02:18:28.040
<v Speaker 5>during the night and then you have to do and then whatever.</v>

5691
02:18:28.041 --> 02:18:29.120
<v Speaker 5>And you assume those are gonna be there.</v>

5692
02:18:29.250 --> 02:18:31.650
<v Speaker 5>Have you ever had any weird wildlife experiences?</v>

5693
02:18:31.680 --> 02:18:32.491
<v Speaker 5>Mountain lions,</v>

5694
02:18:32.491 --> 02:18:32.971
<v Speaker 5>bears,</v>

5695
02:18:32.971 --> 02:18:33.780
<v Speaker 5>anything like that?</v>

5696
02:18:33.780 --> 02:18:33.991
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

5697
02:18:33.991 --> 02:18:34.550
<v Speaker 5>I've had,</v>

5698
02:18:34.550 --> 02:18:34.800
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

5699
02:18:34.800 --> 02:18:36.820
<v Speaker 5>I've had bears eat my backpack or a couple of times,</v>

5700
02:18:36.821 --> 02:18:37.440
<v Speaker 5>so wheelie.</v>

5701

02:18:37.860 --> 02:18:38.081
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

5703
02:18:38.081 --> 02:18:40.470
<v Speaker 5>I've heard photos on my phone of a bear eating my pag though.</v>

5704
02:18:40.720 --> 02:18:43.080
<v Speaker 5>But that happens when you send me all the time is the pair of the bears are so</v>

5705
02:18:43.081 --> 02:18:44.670
<v Speaker 5>desensitized to humans that they're like,</v>

5706
02:18:44.671 --> 02:18:45.780
<v Speaker 5>you used to interacting,</v>

5707
02:18:46.410 --> 02:18:48.600
<v Speaker 5>but there's been a few desks in Yosemite,</v>

5708
02:18:48.800 --> 02:18:49.590
<v Speaker 5>not for embarrassed.</v>

5709

5714
02:18:54.660 --> 02:18:56.130
<v Speaker 5>people getting killed by a bear.</v>

5715
02:18:56.160 --> 02:18:56.940
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

5716
02:18:56.940 --> 02:18:57.181
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

5718
02:18:57.720 --> 02:18:59.820
<v Speaker 5>I'm apple died from the Honda virus this last season.</v>

5719
02:18:59.870 --> 02:19:00.361
<v Speaker 5>Absolutely.</v>

5720
02:19:00.361 --> 02:19:01.440
<v Speaker 5>100% positive.</v>

5721
02:19:01.470 --> 02:19:03.000
<v Speaker 5>Yosemite in the winter.</v>

5722
02:19:03.240 --> 02:19:04.080
<v Speaker 5>Grizzly bear.</v>

5723
02:19:04.081 --> 02:19:04.831
<v Speaker 5>Hold on there.</v>

5724
02:19:04.831 --> 02:19:05.940
<v Speaker 5>No Grizzlies in California.</v>

5725
02:19:06.420 --> 02:19:07.820
<v Speaker 5>It's a their blackberries.</v>

5726
02:19:08.700 --> 02:19:10.170
<v Speaker 5>Yosemite is not just California though,</v>

5727
02:19:10.171 --> 02:19:11.004
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

5728
02:19:11.180 --> 02:19:11.380
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

5729
02:19:11.380 --> 02:19:12.390
<v Speaker 5>you're talking about Yellowstone.</v>

5730
02:19:12.570 --> 02:19:12.781
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

5731
02:19:12.781 --> 02:19:13.520
<v Speaker 5>did I say yes?</v>

5732
02:19:13.520 --> 02:19:14.040
<v Speaker 5>You'll 70.</v>

5733
02:19:14.040 --> 02:19:14.430
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

5734
02:19:14.430 --> 02:19:14.611
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

5735
02:19:14.611 --> 02:19:14.761
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

5736
02:19:14.761 --> 02:19:17.580
<v Speaker 5>In Yellowstone there are grizzlies and they probably did get killed by bears</v>

5737
02:19:18.200 --> 02:19:18.970
<v Speaker 5>grizzly.</v>

5738
02:19:18.970 --> 02:19:19.370
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

5739
02:19:19.370 --> 02:19:20.850
<v Speaker 5>There's California.</v>

5740
02:19:23.140 --> 02:19:23.750
<v Speaker 5>They killed the lion.</v>

5741
02:19:23.750 --> 02:19:25.260
<v Speaker 5>All stone grizzly kills hikers.</v>

5742
02:19:25.450 --> 02:19:25.790
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

5743
02:19:25.790 --> 02:19:26.040
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

5744
02:19:26.040 --> 02:19:26.770
<v Speaker 5>To Yellowstone,</v>

5745
02:19:26.770 --> 02:19:27.351
<v Speaker 5>Yellowstone,</v>

5746
02:19:27.351 --> 02:19:28.101
<v Speaker 5>Yellowstone recently.</v>

5747
02:19:28.101 --> 02:19:29.570
<v Speaker 5>I confused the two together.</v>

5748
02:19:29.660 --> 02:19:29.810
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

5749
02:19:29.810 --> 02:19:30.643
<v Speaker 5>that makes sense.</v>

5750
02:19:30.760 --> 02:19:31.593
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

5751
02:19:31.880 --> 02:19:32.091
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

5752
02:19:32.091 --> 02:19:32.780
<v Speaker 5>but yellow in,</v>

5753
02:19:32.780 --> 02:19:34.310
<v Speaker 5>so they killed off all the bears.</v>

5754
02:19:34.470 --> 02:19:35.650
<v Speaker 5>They had grizzlies and</v>

5755
02:19:37.150 --> 02:19:38.840
<v Speaker 5>killed them in the state flag of California,</v>

5756
02:19:38.841 --> 02:19:39.081
<v Speaker 5>whatever.</v>

5757
02:19:39.081 --> 02:19:39.771
<v Speaker 5>It's a grizzly bear.</v>

5758
02:19:39.771 --> 02:19:39.971
<v Speaker 5>But,</v>

5759
02:19:39.971 --> 02:19:40.060
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

5760
02:19:40.060 --> 02:19:42.020
<v Speaker 5>they killed the last crusade and like 1850 or something.</v>

5761
02:19:43.070 --> 02:19:43.903
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

5762
02:19:44.850 --> 02:19:45.900
<v Speaker 3>The last California,</v>

5763
02:19:45.901 --> 02:19:47.310
<v Speaker 3>it says it here that there were,</v>

5764
02:19:47.311 --> 02:19:48.144
<v Speaker 3>there were killed.</v>

5765
02:19:48.810 --> 02:19:49.160
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

5766
02:19:49.160 --> 02:19:50.100
<v Speaker 3>that's fascinating.</v>

5767
02:19:50.101 --> 02:19:50.550
<v Speaker 3>Because,</v>

5768
02:19:50.550 --> 02:19:51.120
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

5769
02:19:51.120 --> 02:19:52.020
<v Speaker 3>do any of them,</v>

5770
02:19:52.080 --> 02:19:54.190
<v Speaker 3>because they know that um,</v>

5771
02:19:54.600 --> 02:19:58.290
<v Speaker 3>polar bears travel like long distances.</v>

5772
02:19:58.620 --> 02:20:02.610
<v Speaker 3>Do grizzly bears ever tried to come from places that they don't?</v>

5773
02:20:03.300 --> 02:20:04.090
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so.</v>

5774
02:20:04.090 --> 02:20:04.321
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

5775
02:20:04.321 --> 02:20:05.340
<v Speaker 3>I mean like how far</v>

5776
02:20:07.180 --> 02:20:09.920
<v Speaker 3>is that what it would be if that is kind of a grand place to work or us,</v>

5777
02:20:10.310 --> 02:20:14.850
<v Speaker 3>it's a lot of desert apparently there because they know that mountain minds have</v>

5778
02:20:14.851 --> 02:20:15.481
<v Speaker 3>made that trip,</v>

5779
02:20:15.481 --> 02:20:18.150
<v Speaker 3>which is really kind of creepy because mountain lion,</v>

5780
02:20:18.420 --> 02:20:19.111
<v Speaker 3>it's really interesting.</v>

5781
02:20:19.111 --> 02:20:22.370
<v Speaker 3>Mountain line pressure has changed because a,</v>

5782
02:20:22.420 --> 02:20:22.890
<v Speaker 3>they don't,</v>

5783
02:20:22.890 --> 02:20:23.723
<v Speaker 3>they don't hunt them.</v>

5784
02:20:23.850 --> 02:20:24.601
<v Speaker 3>1922,</v>

5785
02:20:24.601 --> 02:20:26.970
<v Speaker 3>it was the last time a graphs killed in California,</v>

5786
02:20:27.090 --> 02:20:28.680
<v Speaker 3>the Sierra foothills in 1922,</v>

5787
02:20:28.850 --> 02:20:29.683
<v Speaker 3>the last woman,</v>

5788
02:20:29.910 --> 02:20:32.310
<v Speaker 3>the mountain lions,</v>

5789
02:20:32.400 --> 02:20:32.661
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

5790
02:20:32.661 --> 02:20:33.930
<v Speaker 3>are hunted in Nevada,</v>

5791
02:20:34.260 --> 02:20:36.030
<v Speaker 3>but in California they don't have them anymore.</v>

5792
02:20:36.150 --> 02:20:39.330
<v Speaker 3>So they've started moving in Nevada or from Nevada into California.</v>

5793
02:20:39.331 --> 02:20:40.320
<v Speaker 3>It's really interesting.</v>

5794
02:20:40.620 --> 02:20:43.800
<v Speaker 3>It's like they've sort of figured out that there's a hunting pressure in</v>

5795
02:20:43.801 --> 02:20:44.240
<v Speaker 3>college.</v>

5796
02:20:44.240 --> 02:20:44.390
<v Speaker 5>She,</v>

5797
02:20:44.390 --> 02:20:45.740
<v Speaker 5>I was just reading this article about,</v>

5798
02:20:45.741 --> 02:20:46.220
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

5799
02:20:46.220 --> 02:20:47.240
<v Speaker 5>about urban animals,</v>

5800
02:20:47.241 --> 02:20:48.500
<v Speaker 5>about like small predators,</v>

5801
02:20:48.501 --> 02:20:49.940
<v Speaker 5>like foxes and coyotes and stuff,</v>

5802
02:20:49.941 --> 02:20:51.890
<v Speaker 5>adapting to urban environments and how,</v>

5803
02:20:52.050 --> 02:20:52.311
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5804
02:20:52.311 --> 02:20:55.550
<v Speaker 5>there's footage of like a coyote going to an intersection looking both ways and</v>

5805
02:20:55.551 --> 02:20:56.930
<v Speaker 5>then crossing the road instead of these,</v>

5806
02:20:56.931 --> 02:20:59.600
<v Speaker 5>basically animals learn the same way anybody else does.</v>

5807
02:21:00.620 --> 02:21:01.940
<v Speaker 5>It's pretty funny stuff to think about.</v>

5808
02:21:01.941 --> 02:21:02.631
<v Speaker 5>Like a little Fox,</v>

5809
02:21:02.631 --> 02:21:02.811
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

5810
02:21:02.811 --> 02:21:07.040
<v Speaker 5>like living in a skyscraper and like using the streets just goes,</v>

5811
02:21:07.490 --> 02:21:07.881
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

5812
02:21:07.881 --> 02:21:08.714
<v Speaker 5>it is interesting.</v>

5813
02:21:08.810 --> 02:21:09.380
<v Speaker 5>They've uh,</v>

5814
02:21:09.380 --> 02:21:14.380
<v Speaker 5>they've got a bunch of coyotes that they have tagged that are living in Chicago.</v>

5815
02:21:14.810 --> 02:21:15.390
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

5816
02:21:15.390 --> 02:21:17.180
<v Speaker 5>that was actually the example.</v>

5817
02:21:17.240 --> 02:21:18.830
<v Speaker 5>The article I was reading was about Chicago,</v>

5818
02:21:19.390 --> 02:21:19.721
<v Speaker 5>isn't it?</v>

5819
02:21:19.721 --> 02:21:19.940
<v Speaker 5>Not?</v>

5820
02:21:19.940 --> 02:21:20.121
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

5821
02:21:20.121 --> 02:21:21.990
<v Speaker 5>I think there's like 60 of them and they do,</v>

5822
02:21:22.370 --> 02:21:25.460
<v Speaker 5>they eat the rats and all that shit and it's really weird.</v>

5823
02:21:25.670 --> 02:21:26.960
<v Speaker 5>Like they barely have track of him.</v>

5824
02:21:27.200 --> 02:21:28.820
<v Speaker 5>He's the king of like,</v>

5825
02:21:28.821 --> 02:21:30.620
<v Speaker 5>I think they have radio bands on them and stuff.</v>

5826
02:21:30.670 --> 02:21:30.880
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

5827
02:21:30.880 --> 02:21:31.251
<v Speaker 5>All the,</v>

5828
02:21:31.251 --> 02:21:34.340
<v Speaker 5>all the berries in a Yosemite or tagged or they were all like,</v>

5829
02:21:34.400 --> 02:21:35.180
<v Speaker 5>so when you,</v>

5830
02:21:35.180 --> 02:21:35.481
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

5831
02:21:35.481 --> 02:21:35.691
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

5832
02:21:35.691 --> 02:21:36.860
<v Speaker 5>except for a little cups and stuff.</v>

5833
02:21:36.890 --> 02:21:37.191
<v Speaker 5>But yeah,</v>

5834
02:21:37.191 --> 02:21:38.300
<v Speaker 5>they tagged the bears each season.</v>

5835
02:21:38.600 --> 02:21:41.060
<v Speaker 5>So Yosemite is California.</v>

5836
02:21:41.061 --> 02:21:43.760
<v Speaker 5>Yellow stone is part of California.</v>

5837
02:21:43.820 --> 02:21:44.170
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

5838
02:21:44.170 --> 02:21:46.200
<v Speaker 5>no concern is Wyoming.</v>

5839
02:21:46.201 --> 02:21:48.050
<v Speaker 5>And I dunno if it's a surrounding states,</v>

5840
02:21:48.051 --> 02:21:49.940
<v Speaker 5>but it's Wyoming and that has bears.</v>

5841
02:21:49.970 --> 02:21:51.070
<v Speaker 5>They have grizzlies.</v>

5842
02:21:51.080 --> 02:21:51.640
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

5843
02:21:51.640 --> 02:21:52.790
<v Speaker 5>Do you ever go up there hiking?</v>

5844
02:21:53.610 --> 02:21:55.220
<v Speaker 5>I have as a tourist and as a kid and stuff.</v>

5845
02:21:55.221 --> 02:21:59.300
<v Speaker 5>And the Tetons that Grand Teton national park is also like a joining</v>

5846
02:21:59.570 --> 02:22:00.260
<v Speaker 5>Yellowstone.</v>

5847
02:22:00.260 --> 02:22:02.510
<v Speaker 5>So the Yosemite bears at attacked your bag.</v>

5848
02:22:02.511 --> 02:22:03.320
<v Speaker 5>We're just bears.</v>

5849
02:22:03.320 --> 02:22:03.430
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

5850
02:22:03.430 --> 02:22:03.890
<v Speaker 5>they're just,</v>

5851
02:22:03.890 --> 02:22:04.700
<v Speaker 5>they're just little bike.</v>

5852
02:22:04.700 --> 02:22:05.810
<v Speaker 5>They just eat your food and stuff.</v>

5853
02:22:05.990 --> 02:22:07.040
<v Speaker 5>They don't really talk to people.</v>

5854
02:22:07.130 --> 02:22:07.490
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

5855
02:22:07.490 --> 02:22:09.110
<v Speaker 5>I don't think anyone's ever been attacked by a bear.</v>

5856
02:22:09.111 --> 02:22:10.250
<v Speaker 5>And he 70 really?</v>

5857
02:22:10.280 --> 02:22:10.491
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

5858
02:22:10.491 --> 02:22:11.031
<v Speaker 5>they're really like,</v>

5859
02:22:11.031 --> 02:22:11.950
<v Speaker 5>they're cute little bears.</v>

5860
02:22:11.951 --> 02:22:12.321
<v Speaker 5>And I mean,</v>

5861
02:22:12.321 --> 02:22:13.154
<v Speaker 5>they're totally,</v>

5862
02:22:13.280 --> 02:22:13.491

5865
02:22:14.931 --> 02:22:17.450
<v Speaker 5>they're around people so much that they get used to it and then they eat your</v>

02:22:17.451 --> 02:22:18.010
<v Speaker 5>shit.</v>

5867

<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

5869

5903
02:22:59.521 --> 02:23:01.990
<v Speaker 1>why take the little piece of meat when I can take the whole piece of it?</v>

5904

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5905
02:23:02.640 --> 02:23:03.510
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty messed up.</v>

5906
02:23:03.800 --> 02:23:06.600
<v Speaker 1>People don't understand how dangerous grizzlies are.</v>

5907
02:23:06.860 --> 02:23:07.440
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

5908
02:23:07.440 --> 02:23:09.930
<v Speaker 1>they think that just because they could be in the car and throw the stuff out</v>

5909
02:23:09.931 --> 02:23:10.351
<v Speaker 1>the window,</v>

5910
02:23:10.351 --> 02:23:12.240
<v Speaker 1>that somehow or another you could stand outside the car.</v>

5911
02:23:12.241 --> 02:23:13.680
<v Speaker 1>Like a guy was really ballsy.</v>

5912
02:23:14.340 --> 02:23:15.510
<v Speaker 1>Thinks he could go out there and do that.</v>

5913
02:23:15.511 --> 02:23:18.810
<v Speaker 1>But that's a lot of meat cause dangle in front of them.</v>

5914
02:23:18.811 --> 02:23:20.040
<v Speaker 1>Like you look like meat,</v>

5940
02:23:47.160 --> 02:23:48.270
<v Speaker 1>Just so you take a look at it.</v>

5941
02:23:48.271 --> 02:23:49.290
<v Speaker 1>Like an armored case.</v>

5942
02:23:49.440 --> 02:23:49.681
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5943
02:23:49.681 --> 02:23:49.891
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

5944
02:23:49.891 --> 02:23:50.310
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

5945
02:23:50.310 --> 02:23:50.581
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

5946
02:23:50.581 --> 02:23:53.100
<v Speaker 1>it's an upcoming documentary that they filmed,</v>

5947
02:23:53.340 --> 02:23:53.700
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

5948
02:23:53.700 --> 02:23:54.091
<v Speaker 1>that they,</v>

5949
02:23:54.091 --> 02:23:56.220
<v Speaker 1>they designed this piece of equipment,</v>

5950
02:23:56.221 --> 02:23:56.490
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

5951
02:23:56.490 --> 02:23:58.500
<v Speaker 1>the structure just specifically,</v>

5952
02:23:58.501 --> 02:24:03.140
<v Speaker 1>so this guy could be dropped off there and have these bears try to get at him</v>

5953
02:24:03.410 --> 02:24:08.410
<v Speaker 1>while he's like sitting there were these enormous polar bear is like chewing at</v>

5954
02:24:08.551 --> 02:24:12.120
<v Speaker 1>it and sniffing it and opening his mouth and tried to bite it.</v>

5955
02:24:12.121 --> 02:24:16.290
<v Speaker 1>It's so terrifying when you're watching it because it seems like kind of a</v>

5956
02:24:16.291 --> 02:24:16.680
<v Speaker 1>tense,</v>

5957
02:24:16.680 --> 02:24:16.891
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

5958
02:24:16.891 --> 02:24:17.730
<v Speaker 1>it's so intense.</v>

5959
02:24:17.760 --> 02:24:17.971
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

5960
02:24:17.971 --> 02:24:18.451
<v Speaker 1>he can't,</v>

5961
02:24:18.451 --> 02:24:19.110
<v Speaker 1>they can't get in.</v>

5962
02:24:19.110 --> 02:24:19.831
<v Speaker 1>They designed it.</v>

5963
02:24:19.831 --> 02:24:20.520
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

5964
02:24:20.520 --> 02:24:21.121
<v Speaker 1>can I get it?</v>

5965
02:24:21.121 --> 02:24:25.020
<v Speaker 1>But there's like spots where you know like air slots when it gets to the air</v>

5966
02:24:25.300 --> 02:24:26.133
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

5967
02:24:27.510 --> 02:24:29.850
<v Speaker 1>and then it opens its mouth and he's trying to bite it.</v>

5968
02:24:30.000 --> 02:24:30.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5969
02:24:30.450 --> 02:24:31.290
<v Speaker 1>it can't quite,</v>

5970
02:24:31.291 --> 02:24:32.940
<v Speaker 1>but it's so big.</v>

5971
02:24:33.720 --> 02:24:37.170
<v Speaker 1>I didn't understand for whatever reason I knew they were big,</v>

5972
02:24:37.470 --> 02:24:42.470
<v Speaker 1>but it takes seeing it next to a person to really conceptualize like,</v>

5973
02:24:43.230 --> 02:24:44.063
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

5974
02:24:44.250 --> 02:24:45.060
<v Speaker 1>oh God.</v>

5975
02:24:45.060 --> 02:24:46.860
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's like 12 feet tall.</v>

5976
02:24:46.890 --> 02:24:48.510
<v Speaker 1>It's unbelievably big.</v>

5977
02:24:48.870 --> 02:24:52.230
<v Speaker 1>And this guy's in there and this thing has just got its arms around the box and</v>

5978
02:24:52.231 --> 02:24:54.840
<v Speaker 1>it's trying to bite it and it's trying to figure out where the fuck it is.</v>

5979
02:24:54.990 --> 02:24:55.823
<v Speaker 1>Here it is.</v>

5980
02:24:55.920 --> 02:25:00.900
<v Speaker 1>Look at that box at this guy he's in and he's up there just chilling around for</v>

5981
02:25:00.901 --> 02:25:01.201
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

5982
02:25:01.201 --> 02:25:01.650
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

02:25:28.850 --> 02:25:31.770
<v Speaker 4>is thousands of times more powerful than mine.</v>

5999
02:25:32.430 --> 02:25:36.990
<v Speaker 4>It's gathering information before they approaches like it would when stoking a</v>

6000
02:25:36.991 --> 02:25:37.824
<v Speaker 4>seal.</v>

6001
02:25:38.400 --> 02:25:41.100
<v Speaker 4>My sand is strongest at the weakest point,</v>

6002
02:25:41.610 --> 02:25:42.443
<v Speaker 4>the door</v>

6003
02:25:50.030 --> 02:25:50.863
<v Speaker 4>fragile,</v>

6004
02:25:51.620 --> 02:25:55.610
<v Speaker 4>that door open systematically trying from all angles.</v>

6005
02:25:55.611 --> 02:25:56.444
<v Speaker 4>Look at the size of</v>

6006
02:25:57.970 --> 02:25:59.970
<v Speaker 4>that appreciation for what this animal is.</v>

6007
02:26:01.400 --> 02:26:04.130
<v Speaker 4>One of the most powerful animals on the planet.</v>

6008
02:26:05.090 --> 02:26:07.040
<v Speaker 4>Almost intimidating animals on the planet.</v>

6009
02:26:08.210 --> 02:26:11.060
<v Speaker 4>One of the few animals that actually see us as food.</v>

6010
02:26:13.170 --> 02:26:14.350
<v Speaker 4>Wonder how that guy got signed</v>

6011
02:26:16.090 --> 02:26:17.020
<v Speaker 4>to a gap.</v>

6012
02:26:18.600 --> 02:26:21.600
<v Speaker 4>You can sniff my nose</v>

6013
02:26:39.500 --> 02:26:41.090
<v Speaker 4>if you haven't seen this video,</v>

6014
02:26:41.091 --> 02:26:41.924
<v Speaker 4>folks.</v>

6015
02:26:41.930 --> 02:26:44.720
<v Speaker 5>You've got to go online and just watch it.</v>

6016
02:26:44.721 --> 02:26:45.740
<v Speaker 5>This is just a clip.</v>

6017
02:26:46.210 --> 02:26:47.090
<v Speaker 5>The video,</v>

6018
02:26:47.091 --> 02:26:47.340
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

6019
02:26:47.340 --> 02:26:47.631
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

6020
02:26:47.631 --> 02:26:48.051
<v Speaker 5>is,</v>

6021
02:26:48.051 --> 02:26:48.770
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

6022
02:26:48.770 --> 02:26:49.570
<v Speaker 5>I believe in.</v>

6023
02:26:49.570 --> 02:26:50.403
<v Speaker 5>There's a,</v>

6024
02:26:50.460 --> 02:26:50.971
<v Speaker 5>okay there.</v>

6025
02:26:50.971 --> 02:26:51.381
<v Speaker 5>It already,</v>

6026
02:26:51.381 --> 02:26:55.790
<v Speaker 5>it's called the polar bear family and me and it aired a Monday,</v>

6027
02:26:55.791 --> 02:26:58.340
<v Speaker 5>January 7th on BBC two.</v>

6028
02:26:58.341 --> 02:26:58.821
<v Speaker 5>But you can,</v>

6029
02:26:58.821 --> 02:27:03.470
<v Speaker 5>you can find it online and you got to see it just to see how fucking I same</v>

6030
02:27:03.950 --> 02:27:04.340
<v Speaker 5>breastfed.</v>

6031
02:27:04.340 --> 02:27:04.990
<v Speaker 5>I'm totally vain.</v>

6032
02:27:04.990 --> 02:27:05.540
<v Speaker 5>Gross.</v>

6033
02:27:05.540 --> 02:27:06.380
<v Speaker 5>It was amazing.</v>

6034
02:27:06.440 --> 02:27:06.591
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

6035
02:27:06.591 --> 02:27:09.200
<v Speaker 5>I would imagine that a guy like you that's so into thrills,</v>

6036
02:27:09.201 --> 02:27:10.180
<v Speaker 5>like that would be a,</v>

6037
02:27:10.730 --> 02:27:10.881
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

6038
02:27:10.881 --> 02:27:12.290
<v Speaker 5>I'm not going to get eaten by bears.</v>

6039
02:27:12.350 --> 02:27:12.930
<v Speaker 5>Mean.</v>

6040
02:27:12.930 --> 02:27:14.150
<v Speaker 5>I'm not saying that you would want to do it,</v>

6041
02:27:14.151 --> 02:27:15.680
<v Speaker 5>but I though it'd be fascinating to you.</v>

6042
02:27:16.100 --> 02:27:16.910
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

6043
02:27:16.910 --> 02:27:17.750
<v Speaker 5>that's pretty hardcore.</v>

6044
02:27:18.110 --> 02:27:18.351
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

6045
02:27:18.351 --> 02:27:19.310
<v Speaker 5>If you ever had a trunk climb,</v>

6046
02:27:19.311 --> 02:27:20.390
<v Speaker 5>anything ice,</v>

6047
02:27:20.391 --> 02:27:22.850
<v Speaker 5>anything like Sharon when I was coming for the first time,</v>

6048
02:27:22.851 --> 02:27:23.990
<v Speaker 5>like last week in Salt Lake.</v>

6049
02:27:24.260 --> 02:27:25.093
<v Speaker 5>Oh really?</v>

6050
02:27:25.340 --> 02:27:25.881
<v Speaker 5>Which a climb,</v>

6051
02:27:25.881 --> 02:27:27.350
<v Speaker 5>like a waterfall is or something like that.</v>

6052
02:27:27.351 --> 02:27:27.981
<v Speaker 5>Is that what it's called?</v>

6053
02:27:27.981 --> 02:27:28.814
<v Speaker 5>Ice Climbing?</v>

6054
02:27:28.880 --> 02:27:29.270
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

6055
02:27:29.270 --> 02:27:29.451
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

6056
02:27:29.451 --> 02:27:33.410
<v Speaker 5>Basically it's like a watercourse and like ice builds up and yeah,</v>

6057
02:27:34.100 --> 02:27:35.930
<v Speaker 5>so like what we did was called the great white ice cold,</v>

6058
02:27:35.931 --> 02:27:36.920
<v Speaker 5>but it's kind of like a,</v>

6059
02:27:37.250 --> 02:27:41.330
<v Speaker 5>it's almost like a steep sort of wall slash gully that like forms up with a lot</v>

6060
02:27:41.331 --> 02:27:42.290
<v Speaker 5>of steps ice.</v>

6061
02:27:42.310 --> 02:27:45.080
<v Speaker 5>So you like climb a little cliff advice and then you go up like a steep snow</v>

6062
02:27:45.081 --> 02:27:46.340
<v Speaker 5>slope and then another ice cliff,</v>

6063
02:27:46.590 --> 02:27:47.100
<v Speaker 5>whatever.</v>

6064
02:27:47.100 --> 02:27:48.500
<v Speaker 5>Is that real unpredictable?</v>

6065
02:27:49.570 --> 02:27:50.060
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

6066
02:27:50.060 --> 02:27:50.331
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

6067
02:27:50.331 --> 02:27:51.164
<v Speaker 5>it can be.</v>

6068
02:27:51.260 --> 02:27:52.550
<v Speaker 5>I would think that there's a lot of,</v>

6069
02:27:52.570 --> 02:27:52.731
<v Speaker 5>sure.</v>

6070
02:27:52.731 --> 02:27:54.290
<v Speaker 5>It's much less predictable than rock,</v>

6071
02:27:54.580 --> 02:27:54.831
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

6072
02:27:54.831 --> 02:27:59.831
<v Speaker 5>because it's constantly like changing temperature and you just fall off for</v>

6073
02:28:00.041 --> 02:28:00.440
<v Speaker 5>sure.</v>

6074
02:28:00.440 --> 02:28:01.273
<v Speaker 5>For sure.</v>

6075
02:28:01.450 --> 02:28:03.560
<v Speaker 5>That's part of the reason I've never been that into it.</v>

6076
02:28:03.620 --> 02:28:04.460
<v Speaker 5>I think it's kind of sketch.</v>

6077
02:28:04.460 --> 02:28:06.140
<v Speaker 5>So you just sketchy.</v>

6078
02:28:06.380 --> 02:28:09.110
<v Speaker 5>So you just did it a as a just like fuck it,</v>

6079
02:28:09.111 --> 02:28:10.040
<v Speaker 5>let me just do this.</v>

6080
02:28:10.610 --> 02:28:11.930
<v Speaker 5>Well just to learn how it basically,</v>

6081
02:28:12.170 --> 02:28:13.003
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

6082
02:28:13.490 --> 02:28:16.060
<v Speaker 5>cause I'm pretty sure I might be doing some trips to like Alaska or something</v>

6083
02:28:16.080 --> 02:28:16.913
<v Speaker 5>this year and um,</v>

6084
02:28:17.290 --> 02:28:19.070
<v Speaker 5>the could climb bigger granite rock faces.</v>

6085
02:28:19.130 --> 02:28:20.570
<v Speaker 5>But the thing is when you go to places like that,</v>

6086
02:28:20.571 --> 02:28:22.220
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's common like a big granite wall,</v>

6087
02:28:22.221 --> 02:28:23.060
<v Speaker 5>which is what I normally do.</v>

6088
02:28:23.061 --> 02:28:26.330
<v Speaker 5>But then on top there'll be like some sections of ice or whatever and you have</v>

6089
02:28:26.331 --> 02:28:29.030
<v Speaker 5>to at least be comfortable like hiking in your crampons and things like that.</v>

6090
02:28:29.600 --> 02:28:30.021
<v Speaker 5>So I was like,</v>

6091
02:28:30.021 --> 02:28:30.171
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

6092
02:28:30.171 --> 02:28:31.820
<v Speaker 5>I've got to at least learn how to use all this gear,</v>

6093
02:28:31.821 --> 02:28:32.510
<v Speaker 5>you know.</v>

6094
02:28:32.510 --> 02:28:33.530
<v Speaker 5>So I went out and practiced.</v>

6095
02:28:34.190 --> 02:28:35.540
<v Speaker 5>Do you have any desire to do Everest?</v>

6096
02:28:36.230 --> 02:28:36.560
<v Speaker 5>I Dunno.</v>

6097
02:28:36.560 --> 02:28:37.910
<v Speaker 5>I mean if somebody would pay for the trip,</v>

6098
02:28:37.911 --> 02:28:39.980
<v Speaker 5>I probably would just feel like the life experience.</v>

6099
02:28:40.520 --> 02:28:42.860
<v Speaker 5>But it's definitely not like a climbing thing.</v>

6100
02:28:43.010 --> 02:28:45.950
<v Speaker 5>Actually somebody posted some rant that you had maybe from standup comedy or</v>

6101
02:28:45.951 --> 02:28:48.290
<v Speaker 5>something about making fun of people on mountains,</v>

6102
02:28:48.590 --> 02:28:49.131
<v Speaker 5>which I was like,</v>

6103
02:28:49.131 --> 02:28:49.330
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

6104
02:28:49.330 --> 02:28:50.150
<v Speaker 5>Everest one.</v>

6105
02:28:50.150 --> 02:28:50.541
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

6106
02:28:50.541 --> 02:28:51.374
<v Speaker 5>totally.</v>

6107
02:28:51.520 --> 02:28:53.770
<v Speaker 5>But it was material.</v>

6108
02:28:53.800 --> 02:28:54.290
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

6109
02:28:54.290 --> 02:28:57.140
<v Speaker 5>well the thing is climate isn't in front of that stuff too because like what</v>

6110
02:28:57.141 --> 02:29:00.560
<v Speaker 5>people do on Everest is so far removed from actual climbing that it's like,</v>

6111
02:29:00.950 --> 02:29:01.340
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

6112
02:29:01.340 --> 02:29:02.550
<v Speaker 5>they don't anymore really?</v>

6113
02:29:03.200 --> 02:29:03.381
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

6114
02:29:03.381 --> 02:29:03.591
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

6115
02:29:03.591 --> 02:29:03.891
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

6116
02:29:03.891 --> 02:29:04.041
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

6117
02:29:04.041 --> 02:29:04.521
<v Speaker 5>it's a hike,</v>

6118
02:29:04.521 --> 02:29:06.890
<v Speaker 5>but I don't know if it was your ranch or another one.</v>

6119
02:29:07.040 --> 02:29:07.641
<v Speaker 5>But I mean,</v>

6120
02:29:07.641 --> 02:29:10.310
<v Speaker 5>you're basically hiring Sherpas to do all the actual climbing for you.</v>

6121
02:29:10.340 --> 02:29:11.180
<v Speaker 5>And then you know,</v>

6122
02:29:11.181 --> 02:29:13.340
<v Speaker 5>if you're like a conventional western client,</v>

6123
02:29:13.341 --> 02:29:13.850
<v Speaker 5>whatever,</v>

6124
02:29:13.850 --> 02:29:14.120
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

6125
02:29:14.120 --> 02:29:14.331
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

6126
02:29:14.331 --> 02:29:15.830
<v Speaker 5>you're basically being shuttled up a mountain.</v>

6127
02:29:16.110 --> 02:29:16.943
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

6128
02:29:17.150 --> 02:29:17.983
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

6129
02:29:18.610 --> 02:29:19.443
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

6130
02:29:20.190 --> 02:29:21.120
<v Speaker 5>Who actually had it.</v>

6131
02:29:21.121 --> 02:29:25.280
<v Speaker 5>So I climbed Kilimanjaro like that with my girlfriend and what my then</v>

6132
02:29:25.281 --> 02:29:29.600
<v Speaker 5>girlfriend and September and I'm just as kind of like a tourist vacation,</v>

6133
02:29:29.601 --> 02:29:29.841
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

6134
02:29:29.841 --> 02:29:30.151
<v Speaker 5>like Oh,</v>

6135
02:29:30.151 --> 02:29:30.984
<v Speaker 5>it'll be fun.</v>

6136
02:29:31.280 --> 02:29:34.190
<v Speaker 5>And it was my first experience with people like carrying all your stuff for you</v>

6137
02:29:34.191 --> 02:29:36.110
<v Speaker 5>in setting up for 10 for you and doing all the work.</v>

6138
02:29:36.111 --> 02:29:36.531
<v Speaker 5>And I was like,</v>

6139
02:29:36.531 --> 02:29:36.801
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>

6140
02:29:36.801 --> 02:29:37.610
<v Speaker 5>this is a pretty,</v>

6141
02:29:37.610 --> 02:29:38.720
<v Speaker 5>it's pretty friggin buddy.</v>

6142
02:29:38.980 --> 02:29:39.221
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

6143
02:29:39.221 --> 02:29:39.981
<v Speaker 5>I felt weird about it,</v>

6144
02:29:39.981 --> 02:29:40.580
<v Speaker 5>but like,</v>

6145
02:29:40.580 --> 02:29:41.720
<v Speaker 5>I mean it is a vacation.</v>

6146
02:29:41.721 --> 02:29:43.250
<v Speaker 5>I can see why people would do that for,</v>

6147
02:29:43.700 --> 02:29:43.941
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

6148
02:29:43.941 --> 02:29:44.810
<v Speaker 5>to feel extreme.</v>

6149
02:29:44.811 --> 02:29:45.231
