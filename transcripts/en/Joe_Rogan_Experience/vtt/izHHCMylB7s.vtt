00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.850
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches.</v>

2
00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:06.610
<v Speaker 2>We've got to be able to think more nuanced about these things and instead of</v>

3
00:00:06.611 --> 00:00:07.090
<v Speaker 2>going,</v>

4
00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:07.451
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

5
00:00:07.451 --> 00:00:08.680
<v Speaker 2>I don't trust Fox News,</v>

6
00:00:08.681 --> 00:00:10.960
<v Speaker 2>therefore I don't trust any media.</v>

7
00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:14.080
<v Speaker 2>Therefore I only am going to go to the site.</v>

8
00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:14.801
<v Speaker 2>That keeps,</v>

9
00:00:14.801 --> 00:00:15.401
<v Speaker 2>as you said,</v>

10
00:00:15.401 --> 00:00:17.290
<v Speaker 2>reinforcing what I already believe.</v>

11
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:18.610
<v Speaker 2>Omg,</v>

12
00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:22.720
<v Speaker 2>Gmos are horrible.com that's the only place where I get my news.</v>

13
00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.730
<v Speaker 2>Well now you're in an echo chamber.</v>

14
00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:25.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

15
00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:26.380
<v Speaker 2>that's a huge issue.</v>

16
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.140
<v Speaker 3>And the other thing that you brought up there about political,</v>

17
00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:31.340
<v Speaker 3>about financial,</v>

18
00:00:31.341 --> 00:00:32.270
<v Speaker 3>all the different motivations,</v>

19
00:00:32.271 --> 00:00:33.710
<v Speaker 3>all the different things and the variables,</v>

20
00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.030
<v Speaker 3>that's also stuff that you have to try to pay attention to in squeeze into your</v>

21
00:00:38.031 --> 00:00:38.361
<v Speaker 3>head.</v>

22
00:00:38.361 --> 00:00:39.194
<v Speaker 3>And that's the thing.</v>

23
00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:40.401
<v Speaker 3>It's impossible.</v>

24
00:00:40.401 --> 00:00:43.310
<v Speaker 3>We need someone like you to sort of break it down.</v>

25
00:00:43.311 --> 00:00:47.810
<v Speaker 3>Someone who has a background in this particular area to break it down in a way</v>

26
00:00:47.811 --> 00:00:48.690
<v Speaker 3>that we can understand what we were.</v>

27
00:00:48.691 --> 00:00:48.951
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

28
00:00:48.951 --> 00:00:49.700
<v Speaker 3>I'm comfortable.</v>

29
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.420
<v Speaker 3>The Cara Santa Maria is being honest with me about this particular aspect of</v>

30
00:00:53.421 --> 00:00:54.960
<v Speaker 3>depression in neurochemistry.</v>

31
00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:55.440
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>

32
00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:55.731
<v Speaker 3>these are,</v>

33
00:00:55.731 --> 00:00:56.840
<v Speaker 3>this is her experience.</v>

34
00:00:56.841 --> 00:00:58.830
<v Speaker 3>This is also what she knows about the science behind it.</v>

35
00:00:58.831 --> 00:00:59.050
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

36
00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:00.310
<v Speaker 2>I have no motivation otherwise.</v>

37
00:01:00.311 --> 00:01:01.690
<v Speaker 2>Nobody's paying me to say this.</v>

38
00:01:01.691 --> 00:01:03.280
<v Speaker 2>And I think that this is why we,</v>

39
00:01:03.281 --> 00:01:03.970
<v Speaker 2>as you know,</v>

40
00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:05.980
<v Speaker 2>the listeners of the Joe Rogan experience,</v>

41
00:01:05.981 --> 00:01:08.080
<v Speaker 2>the listeners of talk nerdy with Carrie Santa Maria,</v>

42
00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:08.271
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

43
00:01:08.271 --> 00:01:12.880
<v Speaker 2>the people who are really involved in the next movement of,</v>

44
00:01:12.881 --> 00:01:13.714
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

45
00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.790
<v Speaker 2>alternative and new media.</v>

46
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
<v Speaker 2>It is our responsibility to continue to support these kinds of programs and to</v>

47
00:01:21.491 --> 00:01:25.300
<v Speaker 2>continue to speak up and become engaged and involved.</v>

48
00:01:25.301 --> 00:01:28.720
<v Speaker 2>Because if we're not happy with the way that traditional media is handling</v>

49
00:01:28.721 --> 00:01:31.240
<v Speaker 2>things because they're playing to the ratings and they're playing to the lowest</v>

50
00:01:31.241 --> 00:01:32.290
<v Speaker 2>common denominator,</v>

51
00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.210
<v Speaker 2>we can't be passive about it.</v>

52
00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.380
<v Speaker 2>We have to support the news outlets and the organizations and the podcasts and</v>

53
00:01:38.381 --> 00:01:39.790
<v Speaker 2>the web shows that,</v>

54
00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:40.810
<v Speaker 2>that we support.</v>

55
00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.010
<v Speaker 2>We have to do our part to make sure that those things don't fail because the</v>

56
00:01:45.011 --> 00:01:49.070
<v Speaker 2>unfortunate thing is we don't have the backers that they have.</v>

57
00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:53.670
<v Speaker 1>People look at someone posing with an African animal,</v>

58
00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.043
<v Speaker 1>like a lion.</v>

59
00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:55.671
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

60
00:01:55.671 --> 00:01:56.040
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

61
00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.250
<v Speaker 1>I think people look at it and they feel like they see a dead movie star</v>

62
00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:06.260
<v Speaker 1>because they don't know like all you know of that animal is sort of wildlife</v>

63
00:02:07.021 --> 00:02:11.370
<v Speaker 1>documentaries and then cartoon versions and the Lion King.</v>

64
00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:12.000
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

65
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.440
<v Speaker 1>you feel like you're looking at that.</v>

66
00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.470
<v Speaker 1>But in America we drive down the road and we see just like contorted pulverized</v>

67
00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.200
<v Speaker 1>deer carcasses.</v>

68
00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:23.123
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

69
00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.270
<v Speaker 1>You can't escape it.</v>

70
00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:25.230
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

71
00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:25.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

72
00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.470
<v Speaker 1>And so I feel like it's never going to be as offensive.</v>

73
00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

74
00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.660
<v Speaker 1>When someone sees a dead deer,</v>

75
00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.640
<v Speaker 1>it's not as shocking to them is be like,</v>

76
00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.410
<v Speaker 1>it's the animal from the movies.</v>

77
00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.701
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

78
00:02:34.701 --> 00:02:34.930
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

79
00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:35.763
<v Speaker 1>And then killed it.</v>

80
00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.450
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

81
00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.900
<v Speaker 1>anthropomorphizing of an animal is a real issue when it comes really feels the</v>

82
00:02:39.901 --> 00:02:40.900
<v Speaker 1>people more or less.</v>

83
00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.130
<v Speaker 1>I remember a friend of mine who worked in the environmental movement,</v>

84
00:02:44.131 --> 00:02:47.130
<v Speaker 1>or I shouldn't say that because she was a conservationist.</v>

85
00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.461
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

86
00:02:47.461 --> 00:02:50.730
<v Speaker 1>This has worked in the conservation movement and she complained about,</v>

87
00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:51.653
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

88
00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.860
<v Speaker 1>half jokingly about charismatic Megafauna,</v>

89
00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:01.520
<v Speaker 1>so that so much mental of Americans gets tied up in the preservation of</v>

90
00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:05.770
<v Speaker 1>charismatic megafauna.</v>

91
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:10.800
<v Speaker 1>And those things become such money sinks that we miss</v>

92
00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:17.270
<v Speaker 1>opportunities to understand like this vast suite of other creatures out there</v>

93
00:03:17.271 --> 00:03:19.130
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't make it onto calendars.</v>

94
00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.940
<v Speaker 1>And she was,</v>

95
00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:20.130
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

96
00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.721
<v Speaker 1>if I remember,</v>

97
00:03:20.721 --> 00:03:25.721
<v Speaker 1>I think she was speaking of the amount of research dollars and dollars and</v>

98
00:03:25.941 --> 00:03:30.170
<v Speaker 1>public interests and things that go into wolves like understanding wolves,</v>

99
00:03:30.171 --> 00:03:30.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

100
00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.640
<v Speaker 1>and there's all the other animals that she calls like non charismatic megaphone.</v>

101
00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:36.710
<v Speaker 1>You just can't get someone</v>

102
00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:38.770
<v Speaker 4>to like care about them.</v>

103
00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:40.300
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

104
00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.710
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

105
00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:43.450
<v Speaker 4>I'd say it's more chaotic now than it has been in recent memory.</v>

106
00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:44.671
<v Speaker 4>I don't think,</v>

107
00:03:44.671 --> 00:03:45.370
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that's a,</v>

108
00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:46.390
<v Speaker 4>that's not a big statement</v>

109
00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:50.380
<v Speaker 3>is that what happens is they'll just an ebb and flow when it comes to these sort</v>

110
00:03:50.381 --> 00:03:51.220
<v Speaker 3>of situations.</v>

111
00:03:51.221 --> 00:03:51.431
<v Speaker 3>When,</v>

112
00:03:51.431 --> 00:03:54.580
<v Speaker 3>when it comes to like what's going on in the world,</v>

113
00:03:54.581 --> 00:03:58.390
<v Speaker 3>power struggles and the power struggles that resolved and then new resistance</v>

114
00:03:58.391 --> 00:03:59.120
<v Speaker 3>builds up.</v>

115
00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.630
<v Speaker 3>I mean is that in your experience how things go?</v>

116
00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:01.951
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

117
00:04:01.951 --> 00:04:03.210
<v Speaker 4>I think it you,</v>

118
00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:06.030
<v Speaker 4>you minimize the chaos by being consistent.</v>

119
00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.910
<v Speaker 4>And what do I mean by that is,</v>

120
00:04:08.911 --> 00:04:09.400
<v Speaker 4>is it,</v>

121
00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:09.640
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

122
00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:10.650
<v Speaker 4>and as foreign policy,</v>

123
00:04:10.651 --> 00:04:11.221
<v Speaker 4>as an example,</v>

124
00:04:11.221 --> 00:04:14.310
<v Speaker 4>if you're foreign policy message is consistent and uh,</v>

125
00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:18.540
<v Speaker 4>and strong and clear and there's no misunderstanding by either your allies or</v>

126
00:04:18.541 --> 00:04:19.200
<v Speaker 4>the people that,</v>

127
00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:19.620
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

128
00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:20.550
<v Speaker 4>that are against us,</v>

129
00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:22.080
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

130
00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:27.080
<v Speaker 4>then you can minimize the chaos that exists if it's not consistent and there's</v>

131
00:04:27.391 --> 00:04:29.760
<v Speaker 4>confusion over where we stand.</v>

132
00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:30.391
<v Speaker 4>And I'm saying we,</v>

133
00:04:30.391 --> 00:04:31.140
<v Speaker 4>because you know,</v>

134
00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.441
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

135
00:04:31.441 --> 00:04:31.681
<v Speaker 4>fine,</v>

136
00:04:31.681 --> 00:04:32.780
<v Speaker 4>we're still at the top of the,</v>

137
00:04:32.781 --> 00:04:33.511
<v Speaker 4>of the food heap.</v>

138
00:04:33.511 --> 00:04:34.890
<v Speaker 4>Whether people are comfortable with that or not,</v>

139
00:04:34.891 --> 00:04:35.311
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

140
00:04:35.311 --> 00:04:35.940
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

141
00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:36.773
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

142
00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:37.951
<v Speaker 4>so if,</v>

143
00:04:37.951 --> 00:04:39.840
<v Speaker 4>if we're not consistent in that message,</v>

144
00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:43.320
<v Speaker 4>then there's confusion and that's where you start to get problems cause you</v>

145
00:04:43.321 --> 00:04:44.970
<v Speaker 4>started getting people probing at the perimeter,</v>

146
00:04:44.971 --> 00:04:46.890
<v Speaker 4>trying to see what exactly is going on,</v>

147
00:04:46.891 --> 00:04:47.940
<v Speaker 4>what they can get away with.</v>

148
00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:49.530
<v Speaker 4>We start getting less leverage.</v>

149
00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:50.280
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

150
00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:50.491
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

151
00:04:50.491 --> 00:04:52.920
<v Speaker 4>we're getting situation in the Middle East now where countries are acting</v>

152
00:04:52.921 --> 00:04:53.754
<v Speaker 4>completely without,</v>

153
00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:54.150
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

154
00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:54.983
<v Speaker 4>consulting,</v>

155
00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.230
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

156
00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:57.540
<v Speaker 4>with the u s you wouldn't have had that 30 years ago.</v>

157
00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:57.960
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

158
00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.010
<v Speaker 4>it just wouldn't happen.</v>

159
00:04:59.490 --> 00:04:59.730
<v Speaker 4>What,</v>

160
00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:00.870
<v Speaker 4>it's like Egypt.</v>

161
00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:01.410
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

162
00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:02.340
<v Speaker 4>Egypt and acting,</v>

163
00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:02.730
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

164
00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:03.051
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>

165
00:05:03.051 --> 00:05:04.890
<v Speaker 4>in what they consider to be their own best interest.</v>

166
00:05:04.891 --> 00:05:05.371
<v Speaker 4>The Saudis,</v>

167
00:05:05.371 --> 00:05:10.371
<v Speaker 4>the Saudis are enormously pissed off at us still over of what they view as,</v>

168
00:05:10.481 --> 00:05:12.570
<v Speaker 4>as the current administration is failure to,</v>

169
00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:13.453
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

170
00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:14.131
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

171
00:05:14.131 --> 00:05:18.510
<v Speaker 4>work with them to try to resolve some issues out in the Middle East and they</v>

172
00:05:18.511 --> 00:05:22.190
<v Speaker 4>feel as if we've sort of abdicated responsibility now whether we have or not,</v>

173
00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:23.370
<v Speaker 4>whether it's the right thing to do or not.</v>

174
00:05:23.371 --> 00:05:23.640
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

175
00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:25.980
<v Speaker 4>I'm just saying from a policy perspective,</v>

176
00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:27.293
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

177
00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:27.691
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

178
00:05:27.691 --> 00:05:31.110
<v Speaker 4>if what we want to do is be isolationists then be very clear about that.</v>

179
00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:32.760
<v Speaker 4>Say this is all we're going to do.</v>

180
00:05:32.761 --> 00:05:33.750
<v Speaker 4>These are our parameters.</v>

181
00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:34.771
<v Speaker 4>That's it.</v>

182
00:05:34.771 --> 00:05:36.030
<v Speaker 4>So everybody knows good,</v>

183
00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:36.661
<v Speaker 4>we're all good with it,</v>

184
00:05:36.661 --> 00:05:37.140
<v Speaker 4>fine,</v>

185
00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:37.973
<v Speaker 4>get on with it.</v>

186
00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:38.791
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>

187
00:05:38.791 --> 00:05:40.170
<v Speaker 4>the mixed messages or the problem,</v>

188
00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:42.280
<v Speaker 1>I was selling masculine for a little while.</v>

189
00:05:42.281 --> 00:05:42.790
<v Speaker 1>This guy,</v>

190
00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:43.810
<v Speaker 1>this Guy Andre,</v>

191
00:05:43.811 --> 00:05:48.811
<v Speaker 1>the blackest blacker than your coffee and tough and he was like in and out of</v>

192
00:05:49.571 --> 00:05:50.410
<v Speaker 1>Juvie homes.</v>

193
00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:53.800
<v Speaker 1>So he got me to sell it to my friends.</v>

194
00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:57.290
<v Speaker 1>So I would have a bad cause like a lot of my friends were into the grateful dead</v>

195
00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:00.740
<v Speaker 1>and we go to a dead shell and I would just sell like a hundred hits a masculine</v>

196
00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:02.090
<v Speaker 1>and so uh,</v>

197
00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:06.290
<v Speaker 1>so then one day I guess I didn't even owe him money.</v>

198
00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:07.030
<v Speaker 1>Like he,</v>

199
00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:11.960
<v Speaker 1>he would give me a bag and then I pay him after I sold it and time wasn't really</v>

200
00:06:11.961 --> 00:06:12.441
<v Speaker 1>up yet.</v>

201
00:06:12.441 --> 00:06:16.280
<v Speaker 1>But I came home one afternoon and I opened the front door to my house and I walk</v>

202
00:06:16.281 --> 00:06:21.230
<v Speaker 1>in and we lived in a pretty nice house and my mom is sitting with Andre and the</v>

203
00:06:21.231 --> 00:06:24.620
