00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:01.893
<v Speaker 1>Hello</v>

2
00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:02.993
<v Speaker 2>bitches,</v>

3
00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:07.270
<v Speaker 2>if you had the opportunity to go and view any culture from the past,</v>

4
00:00:07.271 --> 00:00:11.020
<v Speaker 2>like if you could be completely invisible and walk around amongst the Romans or</v>

5
00:00:11.021 --> 00:00:15.400
<v Speaker 2>cave people or native Americans before the Europeans came,</v>

6
00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:16.503
<v Speaker 2>what would you choose?</v>

7
00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:17.021
<v Speaker 2>Wow,</v>

8
00:00:17.021 --> 00:00:17.801
<v Speaker 2>that's really hard.</v>

9
00:00:17.801 --> 00:00:18.330
<v Speaker 2>Question.</v>

10
00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:19.163
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

12
00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:24.290
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

13
00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:27.610
<v Speaker 2>I don't know when the time would be,</v>

14
00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:32.980
<v Speaker 2>but the first time where anything was trying to be colonized,</v>

15
00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.340
<v Speaker 2>like changed from being what your regular.</v>

16
00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.050
<v Speaker 2>Like the first time I got boat showed up in Polynesia or something like that and</v>

17
00:00:40.051 --> 00:00:41.050
<v Speaker 2>some white people got out,</v>

18
00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.321
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

19
00:00:41.321 --> 00:00:43.600
<v Speaker 2>We're used to being in the fields every day and,</v>

20
00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.490
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

21
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:50.700
<v Speaker 2>this guy hunts and this guy watches after the boys and teaches them and this</v>

22
00:00:51.281 --> 00:00:52.600
<v Speaker 2>one's already more all you know.</v>

23
00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:55.780
<v Speaker 2>And then all of a sudden they come up and they're building like,</v>

24
00:00:55.781 --> 00:00:56.614
<v Speaker 2>you guys.</v>

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.170
<v Speaker 1>Women are staring at their fucking balls two feet from the ground.</v>

28
00:01:06.171 --> 00:01:07.004
<v Speaker 1>What are these things?</v>

29
00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.330

31
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.933
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

32
00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.260
<v Speaker 1>This guy's got a fucking look at his ears,</v>

33
00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.220
<v Speaker 1>jumped off his fucking teeth.</v>

34
00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.350
<v Speaker 1>He's got bones in his fucking ear.</v>

35
00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:21.230
<v Speaker 1>Can I get a Bible</v>

36
00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.923
<v Speaker 1>lesson?</v>

37
00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.230
<v Speaker 1>There was this thing called Noah's Ark.</v>

38
00:01:27.231 --> 00:01:27.831
<v Speaker 1>Sit down.</v>

39
00:01:27.831 --> 00:01:29.390
<v Speaker 1>These fuckers don't pay attention.</v>

40
00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.260
<v Speaker 1>Can you fucking round them up?</v>

41
00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.310
<v Speaker 1>Calling me and the boys going to need about 40 these fucking things.</v>

42
00:01:34.311 --> 00:01:35.210
<v Speaker 1>Climb trees.</v>

43
00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:36.260
<v Speaker 1>What is your character's name?</v>

44
00:01:36.261 --> 00:01:38.510
<v Speaker 1>I love the guy who needs to come back more often.</v>

45
00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.290
<v Speaker 1>This is the conversation,</v>

46
00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:41.683
<v Speaker 1>Joe.</v>

47
00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:43.670
<v Speaker 1>They climb trees.</v>

48
00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:45.380
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean that they fucking.</v>

49
00:01:45.381 --> 00:01:48.090
<v Speaker 1>They don't even don't even with our hands and an agent</v>

50
00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:52.040
<v Speaker 1>out there for 20 minutes.</v>

51
00:01:52.041 --> 00:01:53.160
<v Speaker 1>Eat a Gundam lead.</v>

52
00:01:53.161 --> 00:01:54.490
<v Speaker 1>I run a fuck is going on.</v>

53
00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:55.760
<v Speaker 1>I'm getting eaten by ants.</v>

54
00:01:55.761 --> 00:01:56.594
<v Speaker 1>He's laughing.</v>

55
00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.030
<v Speaker 2>I saw a statement was in someone went,</v>

56
00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.290
<v Speaker 2>it was a tourist spot,</v>

57
00:02:02.291 --> 00:02:06.850
<v Speaker 2>but I pass the tourist spot and went in the house and there was a statement in</v>

58
00:02:06.851 --> 00:02:08.380
<v Speaker 2>there and I know it just,</v>

59
00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:09.370
<v Speaker 2>it's simple,</v>

60
00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:14.550
<v Speaker 2>but it just blew my mind and it said one person could change the whole world for</v>

61
00:02:14.781 --> 00:02:17.980
<v Speaker 2>a better as long as they don't give a damn.</v>

62
00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.540
<v Speaker 2>Who gets that credit and that a fucking day.</v>

63
00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:23.470
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

64
00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:24.880
<v Speaker 2>and I thought like if you really don't,</v>

65
00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:25.930
<v Speaker 2>if you just want to sit back,</v>

66
00:02:25.931 --> 00:02:30.400
<v Speaker 2>you just want to see things better and you really can change for the better,</v>

67
00:02:30.401 --> 00:02:31.990
<v Speaker 2>but you don't have to worry about going,</v>

68
00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.501
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

69
00:02:32.501 --> 00:02:37.480
<v Speaker 2>so and so said that where someone's so set that up so and so did that because</v>

70
00:02:37.481 --> 00:02:38.960
<v Speaker 2>now you're doing it for different reasons.</v>

71
00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

72
00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.510
<v Speaker 2>I never had that before.</v>

73
00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:46.730
<v Speaker 2>I'd never heard that before until like yesterday I saw like I saw that quote</v>

74
00:02:46.731 --> 00:02:51.731
<v Speaker 2>into making that's a problem that I continually have all of us wanting to all of</v>

75
00:02:52.071 --> 00:02:53.110
<v Speaker 2>those ideas.</v>

76
00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.490
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>

77
00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:58.490
<v Speaker 2>I think part of what's excellent about this medium and particularly the way it's</v>

78
00:03:00.221 --> 00:03:02.910
<v Speaker 2>been executed by you lot,</v>

79
00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:04.390
<v Speaker 2>is that it's,</v>

80
00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:05.740
<v Speaker 2>it's discourse,</v>

81
00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:06.101
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

82
00:03:06.101 --> 00:03:06.960
<v Speaker 2>like this kind of things.</v>

83
00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:07.460
<v Speaker 2>Not really,</v>

84
00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

85
00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:08.081
<v Speaker 2>like you said,</v>

86
00:03:08.081 --> 00:03:10.270
<v Speaker 2>the fast moving fast cut sound,</v>

87
00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.900
<v Speaker 2>bitey,</v>

88
00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:11.260
<v Speaker 2>vidyard,</v>

89
00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.530
<v Speaker 2>bombarding of an artillery of mostly erroneous information.</v>

90
00:03:14.531 --> 00:03:15.550
<v Speaker 2>You don't get people here.</v>

91
00:03:15.551 --> 00:03:16.870
<v Speaker 2>People our,</v>

92
00:03:16.871 --> 00:03:19.510
<v Speaker 2>after our talk in examining,</v>

93
00:03:19.511 --> 00:03:20.860
<v Speaker 2>discarding as you said,</v>

94
00:03:20.861 --> 00:03:23.200
<v Speaker 2>who really knows and returning to that point,</v>

95
00:03:23.201 --> 00:03:24.034
<v Speaker 2>it's sort of,</v>

96
00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.020
<v Speaker 2>it's sort of encouraging because I've had like,</v>

97
00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.951
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

98
00:03:26.951 --> 00:03:28.360
<v Speaker 2>like as I like,</v>

99
00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:33.340
<v Speaker 2>I've always felt like an I don't like agree with like a bill o'reilly or Sean</v>

100
00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.880
<v Speaker 2>Hannity or those guys.</v>

101
00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:34.940
<v Speaker 2>I've always kind of felt a bit.</v>

102
00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.520
<v Speaker 2>I think they were all right if I hung out with a lot.</v>

103
00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.670
<v Speaker 2>There's something about bill o'reilly can marginally carve.</v>

104
00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:41.020
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

105
00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.780
<v Speaker 2>come on.</v>

106
00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.560
<v Speaker 2>Like I think I think he was kind of okay.</v>

107
00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.950
<v Speaker 2>You would think you would joke around with them and you guys start laughing</v>

108
00:03:47.951 --> 00:03:50.590
<v Speaker 2>about some things and that's kind of a reassuring thing,</v>

109
00:03:50.591 --> 00:03:50.891
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>

110
00:03:50.891 --> 00:03:55.340
<v Speaker 2>And like it to not be kind of like once you get a like I think that's what's</v>

111
00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.500
<v Speaker 2>kind of ugly about both liberalism and neoliberalism is as you can see,</v>

112
00:03:59.501 --> 00:04:02.920
<v Speaker 2>is people just forcing their idea and they've lost touch with.</v>

113
00:04:02.921 --> 00:04:04.210
<v Speaker 2>And I do it all the fucking time.</v>

114
00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

115
00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.610
<v Speaker 2>Let's start with what is it that we're genuinely here for.</v>

116
00:04:06.611 --> 00:04:09.530
<v Speaker 2>And that thing you said of like you can change the world if like,</v>

117
00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

118
00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:10.540
<v Speaker 2>no one,</v>

119
00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:11.760
<v Speaker 2>like if you're willing to do,</v>

120
00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:13.000
<v Speaker 2>if no one knowing about it,</v>

121
00:04:13.001 --> 00:04:13.330
<v Speaker 2>that's like,</v>

122
00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:13.830
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

123
00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:14.020
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

124
00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:14.240
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

125
00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.490
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

126
00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.820
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

127
00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:18.520
<v Speaker 2>that I feel in my gut shows me how much my ego is still involved in the shit I</v>

128
00:04:18.521 --> 00:04:19.060
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>

129
00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:20.260
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a fan of sharks.</v>

130
00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:21.153
<v Speaker 2>I don't like them.</v>

131
00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.420
<v Speaker 2>They scare the fuck out of me.</v>

132
00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:23.980
<v Speaker 2>And that's what's keeping me from surfing.</v>

133
00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.740
<v Speaker 2>Surfing looks like it's fucking awesome.</v>

134
00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:29.260
<v Speaker 2>I see guys like you on those big waves.</v>

135
00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:32.440
<v Speaker 2>But I don't know about the big waves that that's beyond me.</v>

136
00:04:32.441 --> 00:04:34.270
<v Speaker 2>I believe it.</v>

137
00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:35.350
<v Speaker 2>Even when I was young,</v>

138
00:04:35.351 --> 00:04:37.090
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I ever like this.</v>

139
00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.040
<v Speaker 2>This kind of shit does not.</v>

140
00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:40.360
<v Speaker 2>I'm not designed for that.</v>

141
00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:41.343
<v Speaker 2>It's not fun looking.</v>

142
00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:42.730
<v Speaker 2>Nope.</v>

143
00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:43.563
<v Speaker 2>That's not me.</v>

144
00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:44.360
<v Speaker 2>We're looking at,</v>

145
00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:45.520
<v Speaker 2>for people who are listening,</v>

146
00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.020
<v Speaker 2>we're looking at an image.</v>

147
00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.710
<v Speaker 2>Is that you?</v>

148
00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:47.990
<v Speaker 2>Who's,</v>

149
00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.270
<v Speaker 2>who's?</v>

150
00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.371
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

151
00:04:48.371 --> 00:04:48.880
<v Speaker 2>that's me.</v>

152
00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:49.541
<v Speaker 2>Well Jesus.</v>

153
00:04:49.541 --> 00:04:49.870
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>

154
00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:50.703
<v Speaker 2>tell me about this.</v>

155
00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.750
<v Speaker 2>It looks like I'm falling off a building.</v>

156
00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:56.430
<v Speaker 2>It looks like you're falling off several buildings stacked on top of each.</v>

157
00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:57.160
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you what,</v>

158
00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:57.510
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

159
00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:57.890
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

160
00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:59.360
<v Speaker 2>that actual number right there.</v>

161
00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:01.480
<v Speaker 2>I actually felt like I was falling off a building.</v>

162
00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:02.363
<v Speaker 2>It was an,</v>

163
00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:05.770
<v Speaker 2>I was absolutely sure I was eating shit right there.</v>

164
00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:06.240
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

165
00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:06.731
<v Speaker 2>And you didn't.</v>

166
00:05:06.731 --> 00:05:07.001
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

167
00:05:07.001 --> 00:05:07.451
<v Speaker 2>I didn't.</v>

168
00:05:07.451 --> 00:05:07.691
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

169
00:05:07.691 --> 00:05:08.261
<v Speaker 2>it was a miracle.</v>

170
00:05:08.261 --> 00:05:11.260
<v Speaker 2>I actually fell from the top and landed on my board and made the wave.</v>

171
00:05:11.261 --> 00:05:12.570
<v Speaker 2>And there's a big wave at a,</v>

172
00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:15.970
<v Speaker 2>at a wave off the north coast of Maui called jaws.</v>

173
00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:17.760
<v Speaker 2>Now how high is that wave?</v>

174
00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:21.070
<v Speaker 2>Probably 50 feet on the face.</v>

175
00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:22.030
<v Speaker 2>Maybe,</v>

176
00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:22.863
<v Speaker 2>maybe more.</v>

177
00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:23.793
<v Speaker 2>Maybe 60.</v>

178
00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:27.340
<v Speaker 2>So you're falling off the top of the wave,</v>

179
00:05:27.341 --> 00:05:31.210
<v Speaker 2>like it breaks and you're coming over the lip or the,</v>

180
00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:32.110
<v Speaker 2>what would you call it?</v>

181
00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:34.960
<v Speaker 2>What do you call the edge of the wave came up?</v>

182
00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:35.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

183
00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:36.010
<v Speaker 2>I'm falling from the lip.</v>

184
00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:38.290
<v Speaker 2>But the cool thing is you're doing it with your hands.</v>

185
00:05:38.291 --> 00:05:38.490
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

186
00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:39.940
<v Speaker 2>like you're doing it with your bare hands.</v>

187
00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:42.320
<v Speaker 2>Like this wave comes in and you have to read the wave.</v>

188
00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:43.031
<v Speaker 2>You have to time it,</v>

189
00:05:43.031 --> 00:05:44.270
<v Speaker 2>you have to position yourself so you.</v>

190
00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:48.460
<v Speaker 2>So you have to catch it in the steepest part right before it throws over like</v>

191
00:05:48.461 --> 00:05:48.641
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

192
00:05:48.641 --> 00:05:49.930
<v Speaker 2>because if it throws over your eating shit.</v>

193
00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:50.980
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

194
00:05:50.981 --> 00:05:52.120
<v Speaker 2>you gotta it's just,</v>

195
00:05:52.121 --> 00:05:53.170
<v Speaker 2>it's so precise,</v>

196
00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:53.661
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

197
00:05:53.661 --> 00:05:55.450
<v Speaker 2>it'd be able to turn it on a giant wave like that.</v>

198
00:05:55.451 --> 00:05:57.890
<v Speaker 2>Especially like the bigger the wave is the it moves.</v>

199
00:05:58.190 --> 00:05:58.971
<v Speaker 2>So it gets really,</v>

200
00:05:58.971 --> 00:06:00.020
<v Speaker 2>really technical and so,</v>

201
00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:00.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

202
00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:02.210
<v Speaker 2>a few successfully ride one of those waves.</v>

203
00:06:02.211 --> 00:06:03.044
<v Speaker 2>It's a lot of fun.</v>

204
00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:06.650
<v Speaker 2>I would imagine it gets super addictive when you're in that tube and you're</v>

205
00:06:06.651 --> 00:06:08.660
<v Speaker 2>slicing through it and you see the water.</v>

206
00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:09.320
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

207
00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:10.730
<v Speaker 2>Going over the top of you.</v>

208
00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:11.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

209
00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:11.750
<v Speaker 2>it is,</v>

210
00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:12.830
<v Speaker 2>it is so much fun.</v>

211
00:06:12.831 --> 00:06:13.281
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

212
00:06:13.281 --> 00:06:14.114
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

213
00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:14.811
<v Speaker 2>it is,</v>

214
00:06:14.811 --> 00:06:15.710
<v Speaker 2>it's such a blast.</v>

215
00:06:15.711 --> 00:06:16.544
<v Speaker 2>It's um,</v>

216
00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:17.900
<v Speaker 2>it's super addicting.</v>

217
00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:18.380
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

218
00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:18.770
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

219
00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:19.940
<v Speaker 2>I've been surfing since I was,</v>

220
00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:21.080
<v Speaker 2>I've been surfing on,</v>

221
00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:26.080
<v Speaker 2>on a surfboard standing up since I was five on my surfboard from my dad and um,</v>

222
00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:28.460
<v Speaker 2>I'm still totally obsessed with it.</v>

223
00:06:28.461 --> 00:06:29.294
<v Speaker 2>It's weird.</v>

224
00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:32.750
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing else in my life like that where I'm absolutely psyched.</v>

225
00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:33.680
<v Speaker 2>Like when the waves are good,</v>

226
00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:34.360
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

227
00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:35.330
<v Speaker 2>I'm like a little kid still.</v>

228
00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:36.710
<v Speaker 2>What is it about it,</v>

229
00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:38.601
<v Speaker 2>dude?</v>

230
00:06:38.601 --> 00:06:38.960
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

231
00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:39.793
<v Speaker 2>it's like hunting.</v>

232
00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:40.581
<v Speaker 2>It really is.</v>

233
00:06:40.581 --> 00:06:42.890
<v Speaker 2>It's like I'm out in nature and no one's bothering me.</v>

234
00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:44.060
<v Speaker 2>I don't need to talk to anybody.</v>

235
00:06:44.061 --> 00:06:44.960
<v Speaker 2>I can go do my own thing.</v>

236
00:06:44.961 --> 00:06:47.540
<v Speaker 2>I can go down the beach no matter how shitty of a day I had,</v>

237
00:06:47.541 --> 00:06:48.590
<v Speaker 2>no matter how much stress,</v>

238
00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:49.431
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

239
00:06:49.431 --> 00:06:52.430
<v Speaker 2>like if my kids getting a bad report card or I had to pay my taxes or whatever</v>

240
00:06:52.431 --> 00:06:53.264
<v Speaker 2>the hell it was,</v>

241
00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:54.380
<v Speaker 2>I can just put on my trunks,</v>

242
00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:55.700
<v Speaker 2>dry down to the beach,</v>

243
00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:57.200
<v Speaker 2>grab my board and I'm good.</v>

244
00:06:57.420 --> 00:06:58.730
<v Speaker 2>And as soon as I hit the water,</v>

245
00:06:58.731 --> 00:06:59.410
<v Speaker 2>I'm fine.</v>

246
00:06:59.410 --> 00:06:59.670
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

247
00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:02.540
<v Speaker 2>and that's how I am a bowhunting and people who don't bow hunt,</v>

248
00:07:02.541 --> 00:07:03.620
<v Speaker 2>they don't understand that.</v>

249
00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:04.041
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

250
00:07:04.041 --> 00:07:05.000
<v Speaker 2>why the hell would he do that?</v>

251
00:07:05.001 --> 00:07:05.151
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

252
00:07:05.151 --> 00:07:05.571
<v Speaker 2>what do you,</v>

253
00:07:05.571 --> 00:07:06.404
<v Speaker 2>what do you find,</v>

254
00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:06.981
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

255
00:07:06.981 --> 00:07:07.130
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

256
00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:08.420
<v Speaker 2>what do you find good about that?</v>

257
00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:10.490
<v Speaker 2>Like being out in the forest for days at a time.</v>

258
00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:11.540
<v Speaker 2>It's the same thing.</v>

259
00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:12.250
<v Speaker 2>Just,</v>

260
00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:12.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

261
00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:13.550
<v Speaker 2>people who have a porn addiction,</v>

262
00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:14.663
<v Speaker 1>those coasts,</v>

263
00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:15.090
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>

264
00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:15.661
<v Speaker 1>I had to stop,</v>

265
00:07:15.661 --> 00:07:16.451
<v Speaker 1>but it was getting crazy.</v>

266
00:07:16.451 --> 00:07:17.940
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't concentrate on anything.</v>

267
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:18.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

268
00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:18.751
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

269
00:07:18.751 --> 00:07:19.381
<v Speaker 1>that's what they're saying.</v>

270
00:07:19.381 --> 00:07:21.360
<v Speaker 1>Michael Jackson had some sort of a sex addiction.</v>

271
00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:25.670
<v Speaker 2>Jesus dark too.</v>

272
00:07:25.671 --> 00:07:26.361
<v Speaker 2>Super Dark,</v>

273
00:07:26.361 --> 00:07:27.260
<v Speaker 2>like midnight.</v>

274
00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:34.820
<v Speaker 1>It's just spooky that that guy was doing that to these kids while he was the</v>

275
00:07:34.831 --> 00:07:36.720
<v Speaker 1>biggest star world.</v>

276
00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:37.140
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

277
00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:38.880
<v Speaker 1>we all know it's true.</v>

278
00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:40.680
<v Speaker 1>What are people still going?</v>

279
00:07:40.681 --> 00:07:41.514
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

280
00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:42.361
<v Speaker 1>because they don't want to.</v>

281
00:07:42.361 --> 00:07:43.200
<v Speaker 1>They don't want to believe.</v>

282
00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:44.190
<v Speaker 1>Come on.</v>

283
00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:46.920
<v Speaker 1>There's an elementary school near in Hollywood,</v>

284
00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:47.970
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:58.540
<v Speaker 1>That's Jamie's version though,</v>

289
00:07:58.710 --> 00:07:59.340
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

290
00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:01.290
<v Speaker 1>It's free.</v>

291
00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:03.580
