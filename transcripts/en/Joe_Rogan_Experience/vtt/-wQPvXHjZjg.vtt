00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:02.770
<v Speaker 1>Hello freaky bitches.</v>

2
00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:08.280
<v Speaker 1>I feel like if you created a situation where Iran saw that there was much more</v>

3
00:00:08.921 --> 00:00:13.450
<v Speaker 1>to be gained from joining the Economic Community and playing ball in accordance</v>

4
00:00:13.451 --> 00:00:17.440
<v Speaker 1>with its laws is then in getting weapons of mass destruction.</v>

5
00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:20.530
<v Speaker 1>They're all scared that those chicks are going to find out they don't have to</v>

6
00:00:20.531 --> 00:00:21.640
<v Speaker 1>wear burkas in America.</v>

7
00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.650
<v Speaker 1>Votes cover your cover,</v>

8
00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:28.540
<v Speaker 1>your come over on boats and the seek out black dick like a magnet,</v>

9
00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:31.210
<v Speaker 1>like a magnet to steal filings.</v>

10
00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.460
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps they're tired of being suppressed.</v>

11
00:00:33.461 --> 00:00:35.350
<v Speaker 1>They want a torque on some dude in a club,</v>

12
00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:39.040
<v Speaker 1>maybe no crazy funky religious outfit on and they can escape.</v>

13
00:00:39.041 --> 00:00:39.371
<v Speaker 1>You know why?</v>

14
00:00:39.371 --> 00:00:42.030
<v Speaker 1>Because no one knows the fuck they look like they could just blend right in.</v>

15
00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:44.710
<v Speaker 1>Good luck in your passport photo when it's looking through a fucking lit of a</v>

16
00:00:44.711 --> 00:00:47.490
<v Speaker 1>garbage can like Oscar the grouch and that's what you're,</v>

17
00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:49.010
<v Speaker 1>that's what you're fucking passport.</v>

18
00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:50.410
<v Speaker 1>It looks like he's here eyeballs.</v>

19
00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.660
<v Speaker 1>I mean they have to take their shit out for their basketball,</v>

20
00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.931
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

21
00:00:52.931 --> 00:00:54.790
<v Speaker 1>Don't they are they are loud too.</v>

22
00:00:54.791 --> 00:00:56.440
<v Speaker 1>It's like stealing their soul or something.</v>

23
00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:57.220
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

24
00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:57.611
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

25
00:00:57.611 --> 00:00:57.780
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

26
00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.810
<v Speaker 1>the minute that a lot of Saudi women goes to places like London and quite guess</v>

27
00:01:01.811 --> 00:01:04.000
<v Speaker 1>what comes off immediately their head dress,</v>

28
00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.260
<v Speaker 1>the whole burden of thing and then go shopping and they dress sexy outfits and</v>

29
00:01:08.261 --> 00:01:08.830
<v Speaker 1>they're just like,</v>

30
00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:11.020
<v Speaker 1>yeah cause Russian man.</v>

31
00:01:11.021 --> 00:01:12.270
<v Speaker 1>It's just amazing that you're,</v>

32
00:01:12.271 --> 00:01:17.271
<v Speaker 1>you've got countries that in 2015 still make women dressed like they're in star</v>

33
00:01:19.361 --> 00:01:19.700
<v Speaker 1>wars.</v>

34
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:20.890
<v Speaker 1>This is not the reason for it.</v>

35
00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:22.063
<v Speaker 1>Another reason for it.</v>

36
00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:23.830
<v Speaker 1>There was not there very logical reason for it.</v>

37
00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.701
<v Speaker 1>Logical.</v>

38
00:01:24.701 --> 00:01:26.050
<v Speaker 1>Well I'm just saying if you're,</v>

39
00:01:26.051 --> 00:01:26.411
<v Speaker 1>if you're,</v>

40
00:01:26.411 --> 00:01:26.951
<v Speaker 1>if you're really,</v>

41
00:01:26.951 --> 00:01:27.784
<v Speaker 1>if you're a,</v>

42
00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:29.373
<v Speaker 1>if you're a living,</v>

43
00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:34.000
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying if you're a religious man and if you are trying to create a</v>

44
00:01:34.001 --> 00:01:35.050
<v Speaker 1>productive society,</v>

45
00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.790
<v Speaker 1>the logic went,</v>

46
00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.350
<v Speaker 1>if you have women walking around looking all sexy and naked,</v>

47
00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:43.360
<v Speaker 1>which was a lot of the Middle East,</v>

48
00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:45.070
<v Speaker 1>well if you have that,</v>

49
00:01:45.071 --> 00:01:49.630
<v Speaker 1>what happens is we're thinking about fucking and not producing.</v>

50
00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:50.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

51
00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:55.090
<v Speaker 1>So you've got it covers your chicks up jam and she want to get any work done.</v>

52
00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:56.133
<v Speaker 1>That's not true though.</v>

53
00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.160
<v Speaker 1>I come to America producers like a mother fucker about that.</v>

54
00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.890
<v Speaker 1>How he got hot freaks over the hill.</v>

55
00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:04.240

<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:44.530
<v Speaker 1>no one knew.</v>

85
00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:45.390
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if</v>

86
00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:46.650
<v Speaker 2>you've experienced this yet,</v>

87
00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:48.000
<v Speaker 2>but for me,</v>

88
00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

89
00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.780
<v Speaker 2>I've hunted a lot and so I almost like to punish myself and some,</v>

90
00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:55.590
<v Speaker 2>I like it to be hard.</v>

91
00:02:55.591 --> 00:02:56.670
<v Speaker 2>I like to be a challenge.</v>

92
00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.590
<v Speaker 2>So I will actually create it to be,</v>

93
00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:01.720
<v Speaker 2>I just this hunt in New Zealand where I was hunting these,</v>

94
00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.940
<v Speaker 2>these fallow deer and at any given time for the first few days I could have shot</v>

95
00:03:06.941 --> 00:03:07.420
<v Speaker 2>a deer.</v>

96
00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.080
<v Speaker 2>Well if hunt a lot of people don't realize as hunters,</v>

97
00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.420
<v Speaker 2>it's not always the goal to just go shoot something.</v>

98
00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.970
<v Speaker 2>It's part of the experience.</v>

99
00:03:15.971 --> 00:03:16.804
<v Speaker 2>And so for me,</v>

100
00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:22.080
<v Speaker 2>I just kept passing up animals because the experience wasn't right until the</v>

101
00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.240
<v Speaker 2>last day when I was supposed to leave early and I end up,</v>

102
00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.391
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

103
00:03:25.391 --> 00:03:27.910
<v Speaker 2>I'm just going to be hunting for two hours and don't bring any water.</v>

104
00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.610
<v Speaker 2>And I ended up hunting all day and going,</v>

105
00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:32.320
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know how far,</v>

106
00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:34.000
<v Speaker 2>18 miles maybe.</v>

107
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.930
<v Speaker 2>And I didn't bring any food,</v>

108
00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:36.820
<v Speaker 2>any water and I'm hurting.</v>

109
00:03:36.821 --> 00:03:39.520
<v Speaker 2>And I ended up shooting a deer last light.</v>

110
00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.953
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

111
00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.980
<v Speaker 2>and now is to me is awesome experience.</v>

112
00:03:44.981 --> 00:03:47.050
<v Speaker 2>It made the trip and made that memory,</v>

113
00:03:47.051 --> 00:03:52.051
<v Speaker 2>the hardship made the memory and something that I as a hunter that non hunters</v>

114
00:03:52.541 --> 00:03:56.290
<v Speaker 2>don't really maybe understand is like having these antlers around.</v>

115
00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:58.540
<v Speaker 2>And when the meets long gone,</v>

116
00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.410
<v Speaker 2>I can look at that and remember the hardship and the journey and the adventure</v>

117
00:04:02.411 --> 00:04:06.520
<v Speaker 2>and these other things about the experience and the meat was a bright product.</v>

118
00:04:06.521 --> 00:04:07.930
<v Speaker 2>But these are the memories that I like.</v>

119
00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:10.420
<v Speaker 2>You look at that Moose and you think of something completely different than I.</v>

120
00:04:10.421 --> 00:04:12.220
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember how it went down?</v>

121
00:04:12.221 --> 00:04:13.090
<v Speaker 2>You remember,</v>

122
00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:13.631
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

123
00:04:13.631 --> 00:04:18.010
<v Speaker 2>maybe the struggle or carrying the meat back or whatever.</v>

124
00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:21.810
<v Speaker 2>So I've may have a rack in my house that's sitting up on the mountain.</v>

125
00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:23.320
<v Speaker 2>Why is that one on the mantle on that one?</v>

126
00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:23.711
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

127
00:04:23.711 --> 00:04:25.140
<v Speaker 2>that one I had to work real hard for.</v>

128
00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:29.740
<v Speaker 2>So I look at it and I think it reminds me constantly of what I went through.</v>

129
00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:32.200
<v Speaker 2>When you say that the experience wasn't right,</v>

130
00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.450
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

131
00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:33.490
<v Speaker 2>what do you mean by that?</v>

132
00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:37.390
<v Speaker 2>Like I feel sometimes it just wasn't a challenge.</v>

133
00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.790
<v Speaker 2>It was I would have been shooting an animal,</v>

134
00:04:39.791 --> 00:04:41.800
<v Speaker 2>not the adventure wasn't there.</v>

135
00:04:41.801 --> 00:04:42.940
<v Speaker 2>The challenge wasn't there.</v>

136
00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.280
<v Speaker 2>It just wasn't the right time.</v>

137
00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.860
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to keep going until it,</v>

138
00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:49.000
<v Speaker 2>until it happened.</v>

139
00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.690
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

140
00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:50.350
<v Speaker 2>It's a weird,</v>

141
00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:53.920
<v Speaker 2>but for me hunting's about the adventure and everything behind it,</v>

142
00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:56.980
<v Speaker 2>and so as well as obviously getting meat,</v>

143
00:04:56.981 --> 00:04:58.660
<v Speaker 2>but there comes a point where you know,</v>

144
00:04:59.000 --> 00:04:59.271
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

145
00:04:59.271 --> 00:05:01.030
<v Speaker 2>if I didn't get a deer this week,</v>

146
00:05:01.031 --> 00:05:01.670
<v Speaker 2>well maybe I'll,</v>

147
00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:02.590
<v Speaker 2>I'll get one next week.</v>

148
00:05:02.591 --> 00:05:03.670
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to starve to death.</v>

149
00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:05.380
<v Speaker 2>I've got a freezer with meat,</v>

150
00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:09.820
<v Speaker 2>but I also want to keep that freezer full,</v>

151
00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:14.680
<v Speaker 2>but so it comes to a point for me where it's about other things as well,</v>

152
00:05:14.681 --> 00:05:15.550
<v Speaker 2>the experience,</v>

153
00:05:15.551 --> 00:05:16.450
<v Speaker 2>the adventure,</v>

154
00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:18.033
<v Speaker 2>the meat,</v>

155
00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:20.200
<v Speaker 2>all combining into this.</v>

156
00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:21.430
<v Speaker 2>If it's too easy,</v>

157
00:05:21.431 --> 00:05:23.040
<v Speaker 2>I just don't like it that fast.</v>

158
00:05:23.041 --> 00:05:23.510
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

159
00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:24.310
<v Speaker 2>It'll come.</v>

160
00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:24.851
<v Speaker 2>It'll happen.</v>

161
00:05:24.851 --> 00:05:25.420
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

162
00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:26.470
<v Speaker 2>For me it happened.</v>

163
00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:29.050
<v Speaker 2>I started when I was younger.</v>

164
00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:33.670
<v Speaker 2>I never wanted to stop hunting because I liked the experience of being out there</v>

165
00:05:33.671 --> 00:05:34.480
<v Speaker 2>so much.</v>

166
00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:35.740
<v Speaker 2>So I would do it.</v>

167
00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:39.490
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people call trophy hunting and I'm air quoting that because it means</v>

168
00:05:39.491 --> 00:05:40.660
<v Speaker 2>something different to me.</v>

169
00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:45.840
<v Speaker 2>Or I would look for a bigger deer because I wanted to keep hunting and make it</v>

170
00:05:46.211 --> 00:05:47.710
<v Speaker 2>more of a challenge for myself.</v>

171
00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:53.440
<v Speaker 3>I find that quite remarkable that people worry about this simply because it's</v>

172
00:05:53.841 --> 00:05:57.020
<v Speaker 3>not the way that people actually think about anything.</v>

173
00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:04.240
<v Speaker 3>Let's remember that the longevity aspect of all of that work is a side effect.</v>

174
00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:06.860
<v Speaker 3>I don't work on longevity.</v>

175
00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:07.840
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

176
00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:11.540
<v Speaker 3>I work on [inaudible] the way you might think if you read the papers,</v>

177
00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:14.120
<v Speaker 3>I just work on health.</v>

178
00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:18.110
<v Speaker 3>I'm just interested in stopping people from getting sick when they get older.</v>

179
00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:20.750
<v Speaker 3>Now if you think about it,</v>

180
00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:22.160
<v Speaker 3>oh medicine is like that.</v>

181
00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:26.180
<v Speaker 3>All medicine involves stopping people from getting sick or fixing the other.</v>

182
00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:30.230
<v Speaker 3>If they I affec and all Madison had a side effect that people live longer than</v>

183
00:06:30.231 --> 00:06:31.250
<v Speaker 3>they otherwise would have done.</v>

184
00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:35.930
<v Speaker 3>So the only real difference between the work that sensory effect foundation dove</v>

185
00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:37.310
<v Speaker 3>and the work that everything,</v>

186
00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:41.240
<v Speaker 3>everyone else in medical referral is a difference of degree.</v>

187
00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:46.690
<v Speaker 3>The fact that the longevity side effect of our work may be substantially greater</v>

188
00:06:47.151 --> 00:06:49.550
<v Speaker 3>than the longevity side effect that we're familiar with.</v>

189
00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:51.200
<v Speaker 3>It's still a side effect.</v>

190
00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:52.610
<v Speaker 3>So if we come to the question,</v>

191
00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:54.590
<v Speaker 3>how will I might one to live,</v>

192
00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:55.783
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

193
00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:58.790
<v Speaker 3>it's not even a meaningful question to me.</v>

194
00:06:58.791 --> 00:07:03.200
<v Speaker 3>It's like saying what time would you like to go to the toilet next Sunday?</v>

195
00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:04.513
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

196
00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:07.190
<v Speaker 3>we know that that's a dumb thing to have an opinion about us.</v>

197
00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:12.320
<v Speaker 3>It's a dumb thing to have an opinion about because we know we're going to have</v>

198
00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:16.070
<v Speaker 3>more information on the topic nearer the time we were going to be able to act on</v>

199
00:07:16.071 --> 00:07:18.510
<v Speaker 3>the information and it's the same Dell,</v>

200
00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:19.520
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

201
00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:23.600
<v Speaker 3>nobody makes decisions on the basis of how long ago they were bought.</v>

202
00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:27.650
<v Speaker 3>People increasingly make decisions as they get older on the basis of how long</v>

203
00:07:27.651 --> 00:07:29.450
<v Speaker 3>they think they've got to live,</v>

204
00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:32.660
<v Speaker 3>but that's because the amount of time they think they've got to live is going</v>

205
00:07:32.661 --> 00:07:33.494
<v Speaker 3>down,</v>

206
00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:35.310
<v Speaker 3>which it won't be going down anymore.</v>

207
00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:39.140
<v Speaker 3>If you've got an arbitrary amount of time behind you and other arbitrary amount</v>

208
00:07:39.141 --> 00:07:40.100
<v Speaker 3>of time ahead of you,</v>

209
00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:41.480
<v Speaker 3>you're deficient backing.</v>

210
00:07:41.481 --> 00:07:44.090
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be based on more short term considerations.</v>

211
00:07:44.091 --> 00:07:44.720
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

212
00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:46.460
<v Speaker 3>like peer pressure and thought.</v>

213
00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:46.911
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

214
00:07:46.911 --> 00:07:48.410
<v Speaker 3>I thought I'd point out when people ask me,</v>

215
00:07:48.411 --> 00:07:49.520
<v Speaker 3>they things oftentimes say,</v>

216
00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:50.893
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

217
00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:54.740
<v Speaker 3>take yourself back to the first time you got laid.</v>

218
00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:56.280
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

219
00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:56.920
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>

220
00:07:56.920 --> 00:08:00.950
<v Speaker 3>Now think about what you were thinking at the time.</v>

221
00:08:01.310 --> 00:08:02.480
<v Speaker 3>What are you thinking?</v>

222
00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:03.171
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

223
00:08:03.171 --> 00:08:03.591
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God,</v>

224
00:08:03.591 --> 00:08:06.620
<v Speaker 3>I have to get this person into bed right now because I've only got another 60</v>

225
00:08:06.621 --> 00:08:07.610
<v Speaker 3>years to live.</v>

226
00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:10.340
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

227
00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:11.360
<v Speaker 3>it's just ridiculous.</v>

228
00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:21.410
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
