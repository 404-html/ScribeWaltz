<v Speaker 1>He just took all his money and he bought</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

38
00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just a giant chunk of land and then he's</v>

<v Speaker 1>got one in Texas now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No booze,</v>

41
00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:51.060
<v Speaker 1>You could do any of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't have no worry at all.</v>

42
00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:51.720
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

43
00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.250

<v Speaker 1>I think he drinks a little one.</v>

44
00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.630
<v Speaker 1>He's fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's like when those guys tried to</v>

45
00:01:57.631 --> 00:02:00.360
<v Speaker 1>debate him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like do you ever see a ted nugent versus</v>

46
00:02:00.361 --> 00:02:01.750
<v Speaker 1>a Pierce Morgan?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

47
00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:02.970
<v Speaker 1>On gun control?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

48
00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.690
<v Speaker 1>He led them up like a Christmas tree</v>
<v Speaker 1>because Pierce Morgan didn't have all</v>

49
00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.570
<v Speaker 1>piers Morgan is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

50
00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.050
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a proper sounding British guy.</v>

51
00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.870
<v Speaker 1>But like when it gets to the fucking red</v>
<v Speaker 1>line,</v>

52
00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.990
<v Speaker 1>when it gets the red line of arguments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he falls apart.</v>

53
00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.530
<v Speaker 1>Like Ben Shapiro ate him up and Ted</v>
<v Speaker 1>nugent ate him up.</v>

54
00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.590
<v Speaker 1>A lot of the conservative guys that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>like really slick,</v>

55
00:02:25.591 --> 00:02:28.050
<v Speaker 1>smooth talkers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can eat them up when they get into</v>

56
00:02:28.051 --> 00:02:32.850
<v Speaker 1>the really like the high revs of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation because he didn't</v>

57
00:02:32.851 --> 00:02:36.750
<v Speaker 1>understand that a lot of the gun deaths</v>
<v Speaker 1>is also bad guys that are shot by guns.</v>

58
00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.180
<v Speaker 1>Like people that are shot by cops.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like all that stuff is sort of</v>

59
00:02:39.181 --> 00:02:41.670
<v Speaker 1>calculated it in like he didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand,</v>

60
00:02:41.671 --> 00:02:44.630
<v Speaker 1>he didn't have all those facts in order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you,</v>

61
00:02:44.631 --> 00:02:47.400
<v Speaker 1>if you're arguing with a guy like Nugen</v>
<v Speaker 1>who does these kind of arguments with</v>

62
00:02:47.401 --> 00:02:52.140
<v Speaker 1>people like gun control arguments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's got like his words down to a tee.</v>

63
00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.350
<v Speaker 1>He's done a couple of these.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did one of them in a gun store?</v>

64
00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.360
<v Speaker 1>They were in a gun store.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

65
00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:59.410
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go ahead please on it.</v>

66
00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:00.580
<v Speaker 1>It's hilarious.</v>

67
00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:04.330
<v Speaker 3>I'm not rock and roll stage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just saw sang a song about waist deep.</v>

68
00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.080
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you gotta be kidding me on a rocky.</v>

69
00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.490
<v Speaker 3>Do you ever see Richard Pryor life?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want Sam kinison.</v>

71
00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.100
<v Speaker 3>Get over it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's some funny for a man who is a,</v>

72
00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.520
<v Speaker 3>who is a patriot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who purports to love his country.</v>

73
00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:20.990
<v Speaker 3>That was quite shocking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Disrespecting me.</v>

74
00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.590
<v Speaker 3>Put it in a official CNN.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Piers Morgan.</v>

75
00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:26.760
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

<v Speaker 3>dead.</v>

77
00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:35.680
<v Speaker 3>Anybody that wants to make the unarmed</v>
<v Speaker 3>and helpless people that want to</v>

78
00:03:35.681 --> 00:03:40.681
<v Speaker 3>literally create the proven places were</v>
<v Speaker 3>more innocence or killed called gun free</v>

79
00:03:42.011 --> 00:03:44.220
<v Speaker 3>zones.</v>

<v Speaker 3>whichever is,</v>

82
00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.320
<v Speaker 3>I'd love to suck on your machine gun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The whole point,</v>

83
00:03:50.321 --> 00:03:54.520
<v Speaker 3>the whole point of your defense is that</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people do drop dead precisely</v>

84
00:03:54.521 --> 00:03:56.560
<v Speaker 3>because you are armed to the teeth.</v>

85

<v Speaker 3>You like everybody else to be not true.</v>

<v Speaker 3>You're playing the devil's advocate and</v>

103
00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:56.020
<v Speaker 3>I can play any advocate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like my side job,</v>

104
00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:57.910
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're playing the idiots advocates.</v>

105
00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:01.680
<v Speaker 3>More guns equals less crime.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'll area let me,</v>

106
00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:03.790
<v Speaker 3>unless I'm wrong and not doing well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the couch,</v>

107
00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:06.400
<v Speaker 3>be sure to let you know acid at this</v>
<v Speaker 3>point if you don't mind.</v>

108
00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:08.500
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's something wrong with your</v>

109
00:05:08.501 --> 00:05:11.350
<v Speaker 3>argument,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you'll basically saying that 90% of</v>

110
00:05:11.351 --> 00:05:14.530
<v Speaker 3>the gun crime comes from people let</v>
<v Speaker 3>other 96%.</v>

111
00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:17.050
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they still have to get access to</v>

112
00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:19.000
<v Speaker 3>firearms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you had your way,</v>

113
00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:21.730
<v Speaker 3>they would be 10 times as many firearms,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

114
00:05:21.731 --> 00:05:23.410
<v Speaker 3>Not True.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or you want everyone in America to want</v>

115
00:05:23.411 --> 00:05:24.610
<v Speaker 3>to go?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not at all.</v>

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:28.090
<v Speaker 3>I've never said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got to tell you what is your position</v>

117

127
00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:02.350
<v Speaker 4>It's just a weird argument.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I see both sides of it.</v>

128
00:06:02.351 --> 00:06:03.970
<v Speaker 4>If nobody had guns,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if there's no guns,</v>

129
00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:06.370
<v Speaker 4>nobody getting shot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I think people would be like my</v>

130
00:06:06.371 --> 00:06:09.250
<v Speaker 4>shitty and people more and shit.</v>

<v Speaker 4>they do something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they're your,</v>

132
00:06:11.171 --> 00:06:15.970
<v Speaker 4>they're saying 75 out of 80 gun deaths</v>
<v Speaker 4>or criminals and bad people.</v>

133
00:06:15.971 --> 00:06:17.530
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what the real numbers are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

134
00:06:17.531 --> 00:06:18.880
<v Speaker 4>but that's what he was saying in that</v>
<v Speaker 4>argument.</v>

135
00:06:18.881 --> 00:06:20.200
<v Speaker 4>He was saying something along those</v>
<v Speaker 4>lines.</v>

136
00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:22.000
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The people that guide,</v>

137
00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:24.250
<v Speaker 4>when we talk about people that dine gun</v>
<v Speaker 4>deaths,</v>

138
00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:26.740
<v Speaker 4>a lot of the people that die in gun</v>
<v Speaker 4>deaths are cons.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Most of the violence shit's going to be</v>

142
00:06:33.881 --> 00:06:35.740
<v Speaker 4>happening by people with a history of</v>
<v Speaker 4>violence.</v>

<v Speaker 5>titty,</v>
<v Speaker 5>somebody shot somebody in Africa,</v>

234
00:10:41.021 --> 00:10:43.570
<v Speaker 5>not shot,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but pulled up to the hotel with have got</v>

235
00:10:43.571 --> 00:10:47.830
<v Speaker 5>an Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whether it was a foreman or Frasier,</v>

236
00:10:47.831 --> 00:10:50.560
<v Speaker 5>somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When holly was in his hotel room,</v>

237
00:10:50.561 --> 00:10:52.230
<v Speaker 5>they went over.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was frazier.</v>

238
00:10:52.570 --> 00:10:54.880
<v Speaker 5>What is that phrase?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You went over there with a gun and</v>

239
00:10:54.881 --> 00:10:59.881
<v Speaker 5>pointed it up at the building and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Either or or something crazy like,</v>

240
00:11:00.581 --> 00:11:02.660
<v Speaker 5>God,</v>
<v Speaker 5>these are just pulling guns on each</v>

241
00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:05.440
<v Speaker 5>other back.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People aren't ready for Ali in the 60s</v>

242
00:11:05.441 --> 00:11:07.270
<v Speaker 5>when he's not playing with you have like</v>
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

243
00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:10.150
<v Speaker 5>They just weren't ready for him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He would just look at him.</v>

244
00:11:10.151 --> 00:11:11.620
<v Speaker 5>He's still tormenting him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A casino.</v>

245
00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:15.340
<v Speaker 5>Super metal number.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The casino megaphone out of the bus</v>

246
00:11:15.341 --> 00:11:17.290
<v Speaker 5>window.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

247
00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:19.450
<v Speaker 5>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that was in front of his house.</v>

248
00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:21.730
<v Speaker 5>You pulled up on his lawn?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

249
00:11:21.731 --> 00:11:22.270
<v Speaker 5>he told him,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

250
00:11:22.270 --> 00:11:23.640
<v Speaker 5>that's what he was doing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The bus.</v>

251
00:11:23.650 --> 00:11:26.830
<v Speaker 5>They'd like champ that bad in the world</v>
<v Speaker 5>or something crazy.</v>

252
00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:30.850
<v Speaker 5>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I'm telling you,</v>

253
00:11:30.851 --> 00:11:34.210
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think Mcgregor takes it to a very high</v>

254
00:11:34.211 --> 00:11:36.430
<v Speaker 5>level,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you got to go back and look at the</v>

255
00:11:36.431 --> 00:11:39.850
<v Speaker 5>old Ali stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe sometimes I forgot how good it was</v>

256
00:11:39.851 --> 00:11:41.650
<v Speaker 5>because nobody had been like that before</v>
<v Speaker 5>him.</v>

257
00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:45.160
<v Speaker 5>He showed up at the gorilla face.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Joe Frazier,</v>

258
00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:47.710
<v Speaker 5>what does it say?</v>
<v Speaker 5>The most colorful fighter?</v>

259
00:11:49.510 --> 00:11:51.790
<v Speaker 5>World's most colorful.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cassius clay.</v>

260
00:11:51.791 --> 00:11:54.280
<v Speaker 5>The world's most colorful,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and this was back</v>

261
00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:57.040
<v Speaker 4>before he'd even change his name,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cassius clay.</v>

262
00:11:57.550 --> 00:11:59.290
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy,</v>

263
00:11:59.291 --> 00:12:01.540
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy that that was in our parent's</v>

264
00:12:01.541 --> 00:12:06.541
<v Speaker 4>lifetime and it seems like a different</v>
<v Speaker 4>world when your parents left them.</v>

265
00:12:08.711 --> 00:12:12.040
<v Speaker 4>I'm an old man though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>before Asia.</v>

266
00:12:12.041 --> 00:12:16.810
<v Speaker 4>I do remember being a little kid going</v>
<v Speaker 4>home to living in New York City.</v>

267
00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:19.330
<v Speaker 4>What year was that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What year was I'm Sonny Liston.</v>

268
00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:20.920
<v Speaker 4>I want to say that was when I was a</v>
<v Speaker 4>baby.</v>

269
00:12:20.950 --> 00:12:25.300
<v Speaker 4>Like I was 67 like it's 1967 or</v>
<v Speaker 4>something.</v>

270
00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:28.450
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When did you win the title?</v>

271
00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:33.820
<v Speaker 4>What year was it when he beats all he</v>
<v Speaker 4>listing?</v>

272
00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:35.163
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll slightly,</v>

273
00:12:35.190 --> 00:12:38.260
<v Speaker 4>it was fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They didn't even know how old he really</v>

274
00:12:38.261 --> 00:12:38.681
<v Speaker 4>was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

275
00:12:38.681 --> 00:12:42.220
<v Speaker 4>no one knew how fucking 90 30.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like a Cuban dude.</v>

276
00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:45.760
<v Speaker 4>Their first fight was in 64 seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>65 64.</v>

277
00:12:45.761 --> 00:12:49.330
<v Speaker 4>So I wasn't even born yet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it was three years before I was born.</v>

278
00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:51.400
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was a different world,</v>

279
00:12:51.401 --> 00:12:52.660
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a different world.</v>

280
00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:53.890
<v Speaker 4>You watching that video,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're like,</v>

281
00:12:53.891 --> 00:12:57.430
<v Speaker 4>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like America was just a different place.</v>

282
00:12:57.460 --> 00:13:01.150
<v Speaker 4>So when Cassius clay was fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all of the country would just stop.</v>

283
00:13:01.570 --> 00:13:04.120
<v Speaker 4>Like everyone went in everywhere would</v>
<v Speaker 4>just watch the fight.</v>

284
00:13:04.690 --> 00:13:06.190
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember when I was a kid,</v>

285
00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:09.580
<v Speaker 4>I was um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>living in San Francisco and my parents</v>

286
00:13:09.610 --> 00:13:11.830
<v Speaker 4>went,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we went way out of our way to make sure</v>

287
00:13:11.831 --> 00:13:15.190
<v Speaker 4>that we watch tv because Sonny Liston</v>
<v Speaker 4>and Muhammad Ali,</v>

288
00:13:15.191 --> 00:13:17.920
<v Speaker 4>and not sounding less than I'm Leon</v>
<v Speaker 4>spinks in Muhammad Ali were having the</v>

289
00:13:17.921 --> 00:13:22.921
<v Speaker 4>rematch and the rematch was a big thing</v>
<v Speaker 4>to everybody because Muhammad Ali was</v>

290
00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:27.400
<v Speaker 4>such a hero.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was so much more than just a fighter.</v>

291
00:13:28.090 --> 00:13:30.880
<v Speaker 4>Especially then because he had gone over</v>
<v Speaker 4>the three years,</v>

292
00:13:30.881 --> 00:13:33.460
<v Speaker 4>have not fought because he didn't want</v>
<v Speaker 4>to go to Vietnam.</v>

293
00:13:33.490 --> 00:13:37.960
<v Speaker 4>What year was that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Leon to and Mama Alley is in the early</v>

294
00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:40.540
<v Speaker 4>seventies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to say.</v>

295
00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:41.090
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

296
00:13:41.090 --> 00:13:42.850
<v Speaker 4>you got to have no teeth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

297
00:13:42.851 --> 00:13:45.700
<v Speaker 4>Leon had no team.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Michael was the one that fought Tyson.</v>

298
00:13:45.910 --> 00:13:49.690
<v Speaker 4>Tyson knocked on Atlantic city.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

299
00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:50.381
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

300
00:13:50.381 --> 00:13:52.440
<v Speaker 4>That's Mike Spence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Michael spinks was the,</v>

301
00:13:52.441 --> 00:13:54.430
<v Speaker 4>the genx.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was the former light heavyweight</v>

302
00:13:54.431 --> 00:13:55.930
<v Speaker 4>champion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was a light heavyweight champ for</v>

303
00:13:55.931 --> 00:13:57.360
<v Speaker 4>many years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a really good light,</v>

304
00:13:57.380 --> 00:13:59.140
<v Speaker 4>heavy weight,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really good boxer,</v>

305
00:13:59.470 --> 00:14:03.400
<v Speaker 4>very smart and beat Larry Holmes for the</v>
<v Speaker 4>heavyweight title.</v>

306
00:14:03.430 --> 00:14:04.870
<v Speaker 4>But it really wasn't a heavyweight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

307
00:14:04.871 --> 00:14:07.030
<v Speaker 4>he'd be Larry Holmes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Larry Holmes couldn't pull the trigger</v>

308
00:14:07.031 --> 00:14:09.190
<v Speaker 4>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

309
00:14:09.191 --> 00:14:11.380
<v Speaker 4>Michael just was real slick,</v>
<v Speaker 4>real smart.</v>

310
00:14:11.470 --> 00:14:14.410
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't dangerous enough to like</v>
<v Speaker 4>threaten homes,</v>

311
00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:17.770
<v Speaker 4>like to try to knock them out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But Larry just didn't have it in the</v>

312
00:14:17.771 --> 00:14:21.370
<v Speaker 4>tank like he did later in life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was a controversial decision anyway.</v>

313
00:14:21.371 --> 00:14:22.570
<v Speaker 4>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 4>beat Larry.</v>

314
00:14:22.810 --> 00:14:26.530
<v Speaker 4>And so he became the champ.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess it was like Ibf champ or</v>

315
00:14:26.531 --> 00:14:27.070
<v Speaker 4>something like that.</v>

316
00:14:27.070 --> 00:14:29.730
<v Speaker 4>I don't even remember.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then Tyson just marked them,</v>

317
00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:31.300
<v Speaker 4>merck them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

318
00:14:32.170 --> 00:14:34.300
<v Speaker 4>it was awful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the difference between a real</v>

319
00:14:34.301 --> 00:14:37.840
<v Speaker 4>heavyweight and a light heavyweight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like there's just a difference in frame.</v>

320
00:14:37.841 --> 00:14:40.090
<v Speaker 4>Like nobody had ever done that to</v>
<v Speaker 4>Michael spinks.</v>

321
00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:43.630
<v Speaker 4>Michael spinks was so good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He had a nasty right hand dude.</v>

322
00:14:43.631 --> 00:14:45.610
<v Speaker 4>He was fucking dudes up at light</v>
<v Speaker 4>heavyweight,</v>

323
00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:49.390
<v Speaker 4>but he was also had,</v>
<v Speaker 4>had a long career,</v>

324
00:14:49.690 --> 00:14:52.250
<v Speaker 4>fought a lot of really tough guys and</v>
<v Speaker 4>then,</v>

325
00:14:52.251 --> 00:14:53.270
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>gets uh,</v>

326
00:14:53.630 --> 00:14:57.200
<v Speaker 4>gets the money fight the night that he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that Tyson knock the mountain record</v>

327
00:14:57.201 --> 00:14:58.130
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

328
00:14:58.190 --> 00:15:01.800
<v Speaker 4>I was never so pissed off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My wife is robbing a drug dealer and he</v>

329
00:15:01.801 --> 00:15:04.640
<v Speaker 4>will left the house to go to watch the</v>
<v Speaker 4>fight at somebodies house.</v>

330
00:15:05.930 --> 00:15:07.840
<v Speaker 4>So here I am,</v>
<v Speaker 4>case in the fucking joint.</v>

331
00:15:07.841 --> 00:15:10.820
<v Speaker 4>He leaves 10 minutes before the fight,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm still crawling through a window,</v>

332
00:15:10.821 --> 00:15:14.120
<v Speaker 4>fight in the dog off and all of a sudden</v>
<v Speaker 4>I hear cars,</v>

333
00:15:14.121 --> 00:15:15.980
<v Speaker 4>I get in my fucking car,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got the coke.</v>

334
00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:18.500
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>often I see him coming back and he calls</v>

335
00:15:18.501 --> 00:15:19.850
<v Speaker 4>me like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that way if somebody robbed my</v>

336
00:15:19.851 --> 00:15:21.380
<v Speaker 4>house,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he talking about Nah,</v>

337
00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:23.560
<v Speaker 4>I went,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I came back early because he knocked</v>

338
00:15:23.570 --> 00:15:25.400
<v Speaker 4>them on 13 seconds,</v>
<v Speaker 4>15 seconds.</v>

339
00:15:25.401 --> 00:15:27.650
<v Speaker 4>What the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm never in Boulder,</v>

340
00:15:27.651 --> 00:15:32.630
<v Speaker 4>Colorado on Macarthur Lane.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was casing the motherfuck out.</v>

341
00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:37.300
<v Speaker 4>Those are the days where,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you remember the p?</v>

342
00:15:37.330 --> 00:15:39.740
<v Speaker 4>The closed circuit days?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

343
00:15:39.950 --> 00:15:42.320
<v Speaker 4>We used to watch fights at movie</v>
<v Speaker 4>theaters.</v>

344
00:15:42.590 --> 00:15:43.191
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

345
00:15:43.191 --> 00:15:44.930
<v Speaker 4>it was a big thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

346
00:15:44.931 --> 00:15:47.240
<v Speaker 4>You get,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your friends would get together and we</v>

347
00:15:47.241 --> 00:15:49.370
<v Speaker 4>would go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'd all go to a movie theater and we'd</v>

348
00:15:49.371 --> 00:15:54.290
<v Speaker 4>watch a fight on like closed circuit or</v>
<v Speaker 4>they even have it at the Boston Garden.</v>

349
00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:56.780
<v Speaker 4>I used to go to the track.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

350
00:15:56.870 --> 00:15:59.210
<v Speaker 4>In the metal lands and that's why I saw</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

351
00:15:59.211 --> 00:16:00.840
<v Speaker 4>boy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Detroit hip man,</v>

352
00:16:01.130 --> 00:16:03.590
<v Speaker 4>Tommy hearns fight some,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but like a great fight.</v>

353
00:16:03.591 --> 00:16:06.180
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if it was Duran or Leonard</v>

354
00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:07.400
<v Speaker 4>Duran,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he murked around,</v>

355
00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:11.300
<v Speaker 4>but he fought somebody and we watched it</v>
<v Speaker 4>on a track on a Monday night.</v>

356
00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:14.430
<v Speaker 4>Do you ever see that knock out that</v>
<v Speaker 4>hearns have you seen it reasonably and</v>

357
00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:18.500
<v Speaker 4>pull that up?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tommy hearns man was such a freak of</v>

358
00:16:18.501 --> 00:16:22.190
<v Speaker 4>nature because he was so tall and long</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

359
00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:25.550
<v Speaker 4>And he had muscle,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like it wasn't just tall and long.</v>

360
00:16:25.551 --> 00:16:29.210
<v Speaker 4>He was tall and long.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Buddy was fucking strong and if he</v>

361
00:16:29.211 --> 00:16:30.980
<v Speaker 4>caught you at the end of that right</v>
<v Speaker 4>hand,</v>

362
00:16:30.981 --> 00:16:33.740
<v Speaker 4>I mean it was one of the most</v>
<v Speaker 4>devastating punches and all boxing,</v>

363
00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:37.310
<v Speaker 4>which is why it was so crazy that hacker</v>
<v Speaker 4>was able to just walk right through</v>

364
00:16:37.311 --> 00:16:40.280
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Haggler just walked right through him,</v>

365
00:16:40.281 --> 00:16:41.114
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

366
00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:41.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

367
00:16:41.860 --> 00:16:44.360
<v Speaker 4>Hagler you could just take it like</v>
<v Speaker 4>nobody else.</v>

368
00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:49.160
<v Speaker 4>I mean haggler had to like nasty power,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but one of the things that was most</v>

369
00:16:49.161 --> 00:16:52.580
<v Speaker 4>impressive about Hagler was you could</v>
<v Speaker 4>just hit him with anything.</v>

370
00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:54.820
<v Speaker 4>They never seem to be here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

371
00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:56.480
<v Speaker 4>Ryan had a great fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe four.</v>

372
00:16:56.481 --> 00:16:57.710
<v Speaker 4>That was a great,</v>
<v Speaker 4>great,</v>

373
00:16:57.740 --> 00:17:02.000
<v Speaker 4>great fucking fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Haggler really respected Duran in that</v>

374
00:17:02.001 --> 00:17:06.520
<v Speaker 4>fight and really didn't take it to him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He knew how dangerous Duran was.</v>

375
00:17:06.550 --> 00:17:11.200
<v Speaker 4>Duran was a still a real sneaky boxers</v>
<v Speaker 4>this after you'd beaten Davey Moore,</v>

376
00:17:11.350 --> 00:17:13.570
<v Speaker 4>but see her and just had this distance</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

377
00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:18.990
<v Speaker 4>and he could fuck Duran up at distance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He would just like come in with that</v>

378
00:17:20.341 --> 00:17:22.980
<v Speaker 4>whip of a punch cod.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Damn Dude.</v>

379
00:17:24.870 --> 00:17:26.100
<v Speaker 4>They don't even look like then the same</v>
<v Speaker 4>way.</v>

380
00:17:26.101 --> 00:17:26.850
<v Speaker 4>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ooh,</v>

381
00:17:26.850 --> 00:17:29.550
<v Speaker 4>there's a right hand that drop some,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh shit.</v>

382
00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:33.690
<v Speaker 4>They really weren't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Duran started off his career as a 135</v>

383
00:17:33.691 --> 00:17:37.650
<v Speaker 4>pounder,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then moved up to one 47 and I don't know</v>

384
00:17:37.651 --> 00:17:41.160
<v Speaker 4>what the fight this fight was probably</v>
<v Speaker 4>one 54 if I had to guess.</v>

385
00:17:43.330 --> 00:17:44.420
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] would,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

386
00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:46.370
<v Speaker 4>this fight was at what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Weight class?</v>

387
00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:48.350
<v Speaker 4>Because he fought as high as</v>
<v Speaker 4>middleweight.</v>

388
00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:51.180
<v Speaker 4>We fought Hagler who was at</v>
<v Speaker 4>middleweight?</v>

389
00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:54.810
<v Speaker 4>He was fighting guys at some pretty</v>
<v Speaker 4>heavy weights.</v>

390
00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:57.630
<v Speaker 4>One 54 yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's light,</v>

391
00:17:58.230 --> 00:17:59.130
<v Speaker 4>light metal</v>

392
00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:03.590
<v Speaker 4>or super welterweight depending on what</v>
<v Speaker 4>organization calls it.</v>

393
00:18:04.790 --> 00:18:08.630
<v Speaker 4>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there Duran was like 20 pounds over.</v>

394
00:18:08.631 --> 00:18:11.040
<v Speaker 4>His ideal fighting weight is ideal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fighting way.</v>

395
00:18:11.041 --> 00:18:14.660
<v Speaker 4>It was lightweight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't a big framed guy like these</v>

396
00:18:14.661 --> 00:18:17.630
<v Speaker 4>guys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he still was skillful enough to hang</v>

397
00:18:17.631 --> 00:18:21.660
<v Speaker 4>in with them for the most part.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But hearns Merck.</v>

398
00:18:23.170 --> 00:18:24.003
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

399
00:18:24.460 --> 00:18:27.570
<v Speaker 4>it is right there as the MERC shot.</v>

400
00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:29.500
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

401
00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:32.230
<v Speaker 4>That's one they don't even count for.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you get hit like that,</v>

402
00:18:32.231 --> 00:18:35.650
<v Speaker 4>they don't even bother counting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let me ask you something.</v>

403
00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:37.620
<v Speaker 4>How do you feel about guns right now?</v>
<v Speaker 4>This</v>

404
00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:41.490
<v Speaker 1>point in your life with a family and</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going on in your mind?</v>

405
00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:44.670
<v Speaker 1>How do you feel about guns?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the real problem with guns.</v>

406
00:18:44.790 --> 00:18:48.360
<v Speaker 1>The same problem with everything else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are fucking stupid.</v>

407
00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:50.520
<v Speaker 1>They're a bunch of people that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking stupid.</v>

408
00:18:50.850 --> 00:18:52.290
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you had to ask me,</v>

409
00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:56.700
<v Speaker 1>do I think that everybody in this room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do I think that they are responsible</v>

410
00:18:56.701 --> 00:18:58.950
<v Speaker 1>enough to handle a firearm and own a</v>
<v Speaker 1>firearm?</v>

411
00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:00.270
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>

412
00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:02.220
<v Speaker 1>Everybody in this room is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe so,</v>

413
00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:05.070
<v Speaker 1>but is it everybody in the world?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck no,</v>

414
00:19:05.130 --> 00:19:06.420
<v Speaker 1>but it cou can decide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

415
00:19:06.421 --> 00:19:09.330
<v Speaker 1>that's the part in the whole law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The whole point of the law is you can't</v>

416
00:19:09.331 --> 00:19:12.900
<v Speaker 1>let some Thai ironical dictator decide</v>
<v Speaker 1>who can and can't be armed.</v>

417
00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:15.840
<v Speaker 1>Because at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we really have to worry about as</v>

418
00:19:15.841 --> 00:19:18.180
<v Speaker 1>much as crime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have to worry about the</v>

419
00:19:18.181 --> 00:19:21.770
<v Speaker 1>government turning into crime because</v>
<v Speaker 1>the governments of,</v>

420
00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:26.170
<v Speaker 1>of nations all over the world have</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucked the people over and done shit</v>

421
00:19:26.171 --> 00:19:28.020
<v Speaker 1>that people don't want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>imprisoned them,</v>

422
00:19:28.021 --> 00:19:28.980
<v Speaker 1>enslaved them.</v>

423
00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:30.840
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when we supposed to ignore that and</v>

424
00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:33.900
<v Speaker 1>we supposed to pretend we're passed that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're passed that completely,</v>

425
00:19:34.050 --> 00:19:37.800
<v Speaker 1>people never be like that again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>An armed militia is be in the</v>

426
00:19:37.801 --> 00:19:40.530
<v Speaker 1>possibility that it all goes wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it's for.</v>

427
00:19:40.531 --> 00:19:42.060
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not for when everything's going</v>

428
00:19:42.061 --> 00:19:44.190
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's for when it all goes wrong.</v>

429
00:19:44.430 --> 00:19:49.080
<v Speaker 1>To deny the possibility that it could</v>
<v Speaker 1>all go wrong to me.</v>

430
00:19:49.081 --> 00:19:51.450
<v Speaker 1>You're lying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're lying.</v>

431
00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:54.720
<v Speaker 1>You're pretending we're better than we</v>
<v Speaker 1>are because you look all over the world.</v>

432
00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:57.780
<v Speaker 1>There's war everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's war everywhere in the world.</v>

433
00:19:57.810 --> 00:20:01.020
<v Speaker 1>There's murder everywhere in the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>is robbery and thievery.</v>

434
00:20:01.230 --> 00:20:03.360
<v Speaker 1>Everywhere in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's not equal.</v>

435
00:20:03.450 --> 00:20:06.300
<v Speaker 1>It's not equal with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as the amount of chances people have is</v>

436
00:20:06.301 --> 00:20:07.470
<v Speaker 1>not equal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The amount of,</v>

437
00:20:07.471 --> 00:20:09.600
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the time you do in jail if you get</v>

438
00:20:09.601 --> 00:20:12.990
<v Speaker 1>caught for things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's all sorts of inequalities and</v>

439
00:20:12.991 --> 00:20:15.330
<v Speaker 1>all sorts of real fucking problems in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>

440
00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:18.540
<v Speaker 1>And to deny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to say that we've reached some utopian</v>

441
00:20:18.541 --> 00:20:19.710
<v Speaker 1>place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't have to worry about the</v>

442
00:20:19.711 --> 00:20:22.530
<v Speaker 1>government turning into a tyranny</v>
<v Speaker 1>bullshit.</v>

443
00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:24.233
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's,</v>

444
00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:26.310
<v Speaker 1>I don't think the government right now</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a tyranny.</v>

445
00:20:26.550 --> 00:20:27.800
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they're controlling you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

446
00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:30.060
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they're doing anything</v>
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably oppressive.</v>

447
00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:34.620
<v Speaker 1>I think they respond to it in a certain</v>
<v Speaker 1>extent to the amount of pressure that</v>

448
00:20:34.621 --> 00:20:37.140
<v Speaker 1>people put on them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when people say things like that,</v>

449
00:20:37.141 --> 00:20:39.940
<v Speaker 1>we don't want to go into Syria.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember that Syria thing or Obama was</v>

450
00:20:39.941 --> 00:20:40.771
<v Speaker 1>on TV.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were like,</v>

451
00:20:40.771 --> 00:20:42.540
<v Speaker 1>fuck this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one wants to go to Syria.</v>

452
00:20:42.770 --> 00:20:43.601
<v Speaker 1>They like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what did the dit,</v>

453
00:20:43.601 --> 00:20:43.881
<v Speaker 1>dit,</v>

454
00:20:43.881 --> 00:20:44.171
<v Speaker 1>dit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dit,</v>

455
00:20:44.171 --> 00:20:46.170
<v Speaker 1>dit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dit to ease back on the Syria.</v>

456
00:20:46.290 --> 00:20:48.040
<v Speaker 1>He's back on Syria.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At</v>

457
00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:52.240
<v Speaker 5>the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people that are used to going to war,</v>

458
00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:55.120
<v Speaker 5>liked to go to war.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They make a lot of fucking money doing</v>

459
00:20:55.121 --> 00:20:56.620
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you have to be aware of that kind of</v>

460
00:20:56.621 --> 00:20:58.600
<v Speaker 5>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You gotta be aware of people trying to</v>

461
00:20:58.601 --> 00:21:01.240
<v Speaker 5>force you into things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The other thing about Kent State,</v>

462
00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:02.920
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that was in our lifetime,</v>

463
00:21:03.490 --> 00:21:05.320
<v Speaker 5>you know the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>during the Vietnam War,</v>

464
00:21:05.321 --> 00:21:10.321
<v Speaker 5>they fucking shot kids that were</v>
<v Speaker 5>protesting the shot him on the college</v>

465
00:21:10.511 --> 00:21:14.260
<v Speaker 5>campus for doing nothing but protesting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That wasn't that long ago,</v>

466
00:21:14.261 --> 00:21:16.090
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not that long ago.</v>

467
00:21:16.210 --> 00:21:18.880
<v Speaker 5>I'm not advocating.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That should be some fucking uprising and</v>

468
00:21:18.881 --> 00:21:20.640
<v Speaker 5>people should pull guns.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I'm,</v>

469
00:21:20.740 --> 00:21:25.740
<v Speaker 5>I am saying you can't just have one</v>
<v Speaker 5>group of people running other groups of</v>

470
00:21:27.221 --> 00:21:30.060
<v Speaker 5>people with no recourse with,</v>
<v Speaker 5>with no you,</v>

471
00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:30.450
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

472
00:21:30.450 --> 00:21:30.751
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

473
00:21:30.751 --> 00:21:34.840
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the people don't have any ability to</v>

474
00:21:34.841 --> 00:21:35.674
<v Speaker 5>stop them.</v>

475
00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:38.650
<v Speaker 5>So the people in power,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we just have to trust that they're going</v>

476
00:21:38.651 --> 00:21:40.840
<v Speaker 5>to be good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's crazy.</v>

477
00:21:41.410 --> 00:21:43.720
<v Speaker 5>Why would you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're just people and people.</v>

478
00:21:43.721 --> 00:21:46.840
<v Speaker 5>If you give them too much power,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they almost always fuck it.</v>

479
00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:49.180
<v Speaker 5>The almost always abused the shit out of</v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

480
00:21:49.450 --> 00:21:53.860
<v Speaker 5>It's very rare that someone gets in a</v>
<v Speaker 5>position of power and all of a sudden</v>

481
00:21:53.861 --> 00:21:56.800
<v Speaker 5>does wonderful selfless things for the</v>
<v Speaker 5>world.</v>

482
00:21:57.490 --> 00:22:00.010
<v Speaker 5>Bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They do weird things.</v>

483
00:22:00.130 --> 00:22:05.130
<v Speaker 5>They have weird fucking people that get</v>
<v Speaker 5>paid off of subsidies for like oil and</v>

484
00:22:05.381 --> 00:22:09.490
<v Speaker 5>corn and greasy dealings with private</v>
<v Speaker 5>prisons.</v>

485
00:22:09.491 --> 00:22:13.750
<v Speaker 5>Like there's a lot of fucking weird shit</v>
<v Speaker 5>going on and power.</v>

486
00:22:14.020 --> 00:22:15.640
<v Speaker 5>So to say that we're just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

487
00:22:15.641 --> 00:22:17.520
<v Speaker 5>everything's gonna be fine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We don't need guns in him.</v>

488
00:22:17.610 --> 00:22:20.920
<v Speaker 5>In England we didn't have guns and we</v>
<v Speaker 5>find you still a queen.</v>

489
00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:25.420
<v Speaker 5>You still in some weird fucking quasi</v>
<v Speaker 5>imperial state.</v>

490
00:22:26.410 --> 00:22:29.170
<v Speaker 5>The scariest thing though is like if you</v>
<v Speaker 5>go on facebook and you scroll through</v>

491
00:22:29.171 --> 00:22:32.470
<v Speaker 5>this video after video of people fight,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like that's the biggest thing that was</v>

492
00:22:32.471 --> 00:22:35.740
<v Speaker 5>worldstar orange people fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well that's only hears me for all these</v>

493
00:22:35.741 --> 00:22:37.540
<v Speaker 5>people to have guns like it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's true too.</v>

494
00:22:38.190 --> 00:22:40.450
<v Speaker 5>But to be honest,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like with all the road rage happening,</v>

495
00:22:40.451 --> 00:22:42.880
<v Speaker 5>like that guy a few months ago,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it got pulled out of his car.</v>

496
00:22:42.881 --> 00:22:46.240
<v Speaker 5>I'm like Hollywood boulevard.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Some fucking gun took up to be on the</v>

497
00:22:46.241 --> 00:22:49.570
<v Speaker 5>offensive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't want a gun to be on the</v>

498
00:22:49.571 --> 00:22:50.770
<v Speaker 5>offensive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

499
00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:54.190
<v Speaker 5>I want a gun and case.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Last night him and I were talking shit</v>

500
00:22:54.191 --> 00:22:57.910
<v Speaker 5>to pull 30th bet on my side street.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Three cops with three,</v>

501
00:22:57.911 --> 00:23:01.060
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a guy kept circling God,</v>

502
00:23:01.150 --> 00:23:03.880
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>after half hour cop came by because</v>

503
00:23:03.881 --> 00:23:06.610
<v Speaker 5>somebody actually called the problem</v>
<v Speaker 5>with competencies is two guys standing</v>

504
00:23:06.611 --> 00:23:07.560
<v Speaker 5>out there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ah,</v>

505
00:23:07.630 --> 00:23:08.463
<v Speaker 5>bullshit.</v>

506
00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:10.390
<v Speaker 5>Look at you and criminal looking</v>
<v Speaker 5>motherfucker.</v>

507
00:23:10.580 --> 00:23:12.840
<v Speaker 5>We were out there just telling stories</v>
<v Speaker 5>that till the commies.</v>

508
00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:13.693
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know</v>

509
00:23:15.790 --> 00:23:17.860
<v Speaker 5>for a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then when that white car came around the</v>

510
00:23:17.861 --> 00:23:20.860
<v Speaker 5>second time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I thought I needed a gun.</v>

511
00:23:21.220 --> 00:23:22.750
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what people are thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

512
00:23:22.751 --> 00:23:25.990
<v Speaker 5>you don't know what people are thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You could zig when you could have zagged</v>

513
00:23:26.170 --> 00:23:29.400
<v Speaker 5>and you could run into someone who's out</v>
<v Speaker 5>of their fucking monitor and fucking</v>

514
00:23:29.420 --> 00:23:31.420
<v Speaker 5>once and you never know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

515
00:23:31.421 --> 00:23:33.490
<v Speaker 5>I'm not an advocate of being armed all</v>
<v Speaker 5>the time.</v>

516
00:23:33.491 --> 00:23:37.000
<v Speaker 5>That's not what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What I'm saying is you can't let the</v>

517
00:23:37.001 --> 00:23:41.470
<v Speaker 5>government tell you whether or not you</v>
<v Speaker 5>can have a weapon.</v>

518
00:23:41.890 --> 00:23:43.750
<v Speaker 5>It's just not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't make sense.</v>

519
00:23:43.751 --> 00:23:44.920
<v Speaker 5>For years,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I had the felony.</v>

520
00:23:45.110 --> 00:23:49.550
<v Speaker 5>I still have the felonies and the</v>
<v Speaker 5>government tells me I can't have a</v>

521
00:23:49.551 --> 00:23:51.230
<v Speaker 5>pistol.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now.</v>

522
00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:53.690
<v Speaker 5>Mike crime was with a pistol.</v>

523
00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:56.210
<v Speaker 5>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They go off.</v>

524
00:23:56.211 --> 00:23:57.920
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there was a potential for violence.</v>

525
00:23:57.950 --> 00:24:01.130
<v Speaker 5>There's always a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>always a potential for violence in my</v>

526
00:24:01.131 --> 00:24:04.340
<v Speaker 5>heart and in my mind.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I did a probationary period already.</v>

527
00:24:05.450 --> 00:24:09.500
<v Speaker 5>That was a 19 987 I did a probationary</v>
<v Speaker 5>period.</v>

528
00:24:09.501 --> 00:24:11.210
<v Speaker 5>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>more in the probationary period.</v>

529
00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:14.870
<v Speaker 5>I feel in my heart right now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm capable of carrying a gun.</v>

530
00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:19.010
<v Speaker 5>As much as I hate it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I fucking hate those things because I</v>

531
00:24:19.011 --> 00:24:20.720
<v Speaker 5>know what they bring.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know what I'm saying?</v>

532
00:24:20.721 --> 00:24:23.300
<v Speaker 5>I know what they bring to some people</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I got to bring it to me cause I'm</v>

533
00:24:23.301 --> 00:24:25.700
<v Speaker 5>not young and stupid anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you understand me?</v>

<v Speaker 5>I really wanted to.</v>

535
00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:32.180
<v Speaker 5>There's weird people doing every time</v>
<v Speaker 5>you watched the news,</v>

536
00:24:32.181 --> 00:24:34.130
<v Speaker 5>every time I watch the news and I see</v>
<v Speaker 5>something stupid.</v>

537
00:24:34.250 --> 00:24:36.740
<v Speaker 5>What happened in Houston yesterday?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You see that?</v>

538
00:24:36.740 --> 00:24:37.460
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

<v Speaker 5>There was so many fucking bullets that</v>

542
00:24:47.841 --> 00:24:50.130
<v Speaker 5>the gas station blow up in a suburban</v>
<v Speaker 5>install.</v>

543
00:24:50.630 --> 00:24:52.730
<v Speaker 5>The cops were in this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you got to see the cop cars.</v>

544
00:24:53.090 --> 00:24:56.240
<v Speaker 5>It was like heat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Remember those cars with the windshields</v>

545
00:24:56.241 --> 00:24:59.040
<v Speaker 5>and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So do not get in a road rage with</v>

546
00:24:59.060 --> 00:24:59.551
<v Speaker 5>somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

547
00:24:59.551 --> 00:24:59.821
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

548
00:24:59.821 --> 00:25:01.490
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He just wanted to go guest as you shot a</v>

549
00:25:01.491 --> 00:25:04.130
<v Speaker 5>customer and from there the party</v>
<v Speaker 5>started,</v>

550
00:25:04.131 --> 00:25:08.090
<v Speaker 5>walked down the street shooting a one</v>
<v Speaker 5>dead six engine,</v>

551
00:25:08.330 --> 00:25:10.580
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>shot up 30 fucking cause in the middle</v>

552
00:25:10.581 --> 00:25:12.950
<v Speaker 5>of the street.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm walking into a movie with my</v>

553
00:25:12.951 --> 00:25:15.680
<v Speaker 5>daughter.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm minding my business instead of</v>

554
00:25:15.681 --> 00:25:18.040
<v Speaker 5>fucking driving.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's walk through the Taco place today.</v>

555
00:25:18.510 --> 00:25:20.030
<v Speaker 5>That could happen.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That could happen.</v>

556
00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:22.760
<v Speaker 5>I know this going in when I leave my</v>
<v Speaker 5>house every morning,</v>

557
00:25:22.761 --> 00:25:26.390
<v Speaker 5>I know this is possible and that's the</v>
<v Speaker 5>messed up part because he has a gun,</v>

558
00:25:26.420 --> 00:25:28.610
<v Speaker 5>he has the right to have a gun.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But if someone else in Houston,</v>

559
00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:30.270
<v Speaker 5>they come up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>shot dead,</v>

560

<v Speaker 5>Just that whoever you need that in your</v>

561
00:25:34.251 --> 00:25:37.010
<v Speaker 5>life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now I'm not a sharp shooter.</v>

562
00:25:37.011 --> 00:25:38.720
<v Speaker 5>Black could shoot him in the fucking</v>
<v Speaker 5>leg.</v>

563
00:25:39.290 --> 00:25:41.930
<v Speaker 5>I believe in shooting them in the leg.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If I have a great cover,</v>

564
00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:44.810
<v Speaker 5>I'm not looking to shoot the fucking guy</v>
<v Speaker 5>like the cops are gonna.</v>

00:25:48.220 --> 00:25:52.460
<v Speaker 5>Mass Texas to where everybody's armed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But you know,</v>

567
00:25:52.461 --> 00:25:57.440
<v Speaker 5>many people are not trained.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's also big part of a brother.</v>

568
00:25:57.500 --> 00:26:00.680
<v Speaker 5>Let me tell you something.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You have no idea what happens to your</v>

569
00:26:00.681 --> 00:26:03.440

<v Speaker 5>from me.</v>

<v Speaker 5>And I know,</v>

<v Speaker 5>but you've never heard a gunshot go off.</v>

574
00:26:14.970 --> 00:26:19.970
<v Speaker 5>You got to see people's faces to see</v>
<v Speaker 5>people's faces and you hear that clip</v>

<v Speaker 5>Ain't one of these movies.</v>

578
00:26:27.681 --> 00:26:29.690
<v Speaker 5>This is [inaudible] stadium.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

579
00:26:30.230 --> 00:26:31.820
<v Speaker 5>just shoot you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It just kills you.</v>

580
00:26:32.270 --> 00:26:33.920
<v Speaker 5>That's why people freeze.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Freeze.</v>

581
00:26:33.921 --> 00:26:35.660
<v Speaker 5>You're going to shock people that are</v>
<v Speaker 5>not used to that.</v>

582
00:26:35.661 --> 00:26:38.570
<v Speaker 5>They play Bingo and they take their</v>
<v Speaker 5>family for ice cream.</v>

583
00:26:38.571 --> 00:26:40.330
<v Speaker 5>They don't need that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

584
00:26:40.910 --> 00:26:42.590
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm petrified.</v>

585
00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:44.060
<v Speaker 5>I live in theories of</v>

586
00:26:44.060 --> 00:26:46.740
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It always listen to this Ted podcast.</v>

587
00:26:46.741 --> 00:26:50.280
<v Speaker 1>It was really interesting man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they were talking about a comradery</v>

588
00:26:50.550 --> 00:26:52.920
<v Speaker 1>and they were talking about the people</v>
<v Speaker 1>that go to war together.</v>

589
00:26:52.921 --> 00:26:55.470
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that they all say</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that,</v>

590
00:26:55.590 --> 00:26:58.080
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their comradery and their love for each</v>

591
00:26:58.081 --> 00:27:02.940
<v Speaker 1>other is unlike any love or friendship</v>
<v Speaker 1>that anybody else could ever possibly</v>

592
00:27:02.941 --> 00:27:07.941
<v Speaker 1>experience because it's so intense</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's like life or death every</v>

593
00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:12.020
<v Speaker 1>single day in that when the wars are</v>
<v Speaker 1>over and they're back home,</v>

594
00:27:12.050 --> 00:27:13.230
<v Speaker 1>they're happy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're safe and they're with their</v>

595
00:27:13.231 --> 00:27:14.240
<v Speaker 1>family and everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they,</v>

596
00:27:14.310 --> 00:27:17.850
<v Speaker 1>they look back and they go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the best time of my life was being at</v>

597
00:27:17.851 --> 00:27:19.440
<v Speaker 1>war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like tat.</v>

598
00:27:19.830 --> 00:27:23.400
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does that say about people about,</v>

599
00:27:23.430 --> 00:27:24.990
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is not a judgment,</v>

600
00:27:25.050 --> 00:27:27.750
<v Speaker 1>I'm not like not a moral judgment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does that say about people?</v>

601
00:27:28.020 --> 00:27:31.890
<v Speaker 1>What I'm saying is what does that say</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the way the brain works?</v>

602
00:27:32.230 --> 00:27:37.230
<v Speaker 1>Like how strange is it that people can</v>
<v Speaker 1>get so excited about being in danger and</v>

603
00:27:39.181 --> 00:27:41.850
<v Speaker 1>the comradery that comes from being in</v>
<v Speaker 1>danger?</v>

604
00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:47.060
<v Speaker 1>It like reawakens us almost puts us in</v>
<v Speaker 1>this like primal state that we use to</v>

605
00:27:47.701 --> 00:27:50.940
<v Speaker 1>exist in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now instead of that worst case</v>

606
00:27:50.941 --> 00:27:53.040
<v Speaker 1>scenario,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some guy fucking snaps and he's on the</v>

607
00:27:53.041 --> 00:27:54.330
<v Speaker 1>high,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he starts shooting at people.</v>

608
00:27:54.331 --> 00:27:56.190
<v Speaker 1>That's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of like worst case scenario</v>

609
00:27:56.191 --> 00:28:00.060
<v Speaker 1>that we all worry about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But most people fucking keep it</v>

610
00:28:00.061 --> 00:28:02.220
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is one of the most amazing things</v>

611
00:28:02.460 --> 00:28:06.510
<v Speaker 1>about being a person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the experience is flat,</v>

612
00:28:06.810 --> 00:28:09.780
<v Speaker 1>does not enough excitement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's not enough happening.</v>

613
00:28:09.990 --> 00:28:12.540
<v Speaker 1>There's not enough stimulation is not</v>
<v Speaker 1>enough creativity.</v>

614
00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:14.880
<v Speaker 1>So you live a different life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you live a different life.</v>

615
00:28:14.881 --> 00:28:17.460
<v Speaker 1>You guys are podcasts and then doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>standup shows.</v>

616
00:28:17.461 --> 00:28:20.810
<v Speaker 1>So there's all this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how this outpouring of creativity.</v>

617
00:28:20.811 --> 00:28:21.644
<v Speaker 1>You have all this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

618
00:28:21.690 --> 00:28:25.320
<v Speaker 1>room for expression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people that just feel like</v>

619
00:28:25.380 --> 00:28:27.360
<v Speaker 1>compressed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they feel like they've just,</v>

620
00:28:27.390 --> 00:28:30.330
<v Speaker 1>they've got a board tied to their chest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>into their back,</v>

621
00:28:30.331 --> 00:28:34.650
<v Speaker 1>and every day someone pulls the fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>strap on that board and that's every</v>

622
00:28:34.651 --> 00:28:36.450
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's just boring as fuck.</v>

623
00:28:36.510 --> 00:28:40.140
<v Speaker 1>And when they deploy and they're over</v>
<v Speaker 1>there and you know,</v>

624
00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:41.370
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're gonna miss their family.</v>

625
00:28:41.371 --> 00:28:43.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to be risking their lives.</v>

626
00:28:43.321 --> 00:28:43.921
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the,</v>

627
00:28:43.921 --> 00:28:46.680
<v Speaker 1>all those things are 100% true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for them,</v>

628
00:28:46.950 --> 00:28:49.590
<v Speaker 1>that experience was the best time of</v>
<v Speaker 1>their life.</v>

629
00:28:49.740 --> 00:28:53.300
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're strange.</v>

630
00:28:53.330 --> 00:28:53.810
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

631
00:28:53.810 --> 00:28:54.620
<v Speaker 8>no,</v>
<v Speaker 8>no.</v>

632
00:28:54.620 --> 00:28:57.260
<v Speaker 8>Because you and I work in an office</v>
<v Speaker 8>together.</v>

633
00:28:57.890 --> 00:29:00.170
<v Speaker 8>You'll meet Jamie and lead work in an</v>
<v Speaker 8>office together.</v>

634
00:29:00.171 --> 00:29:03.870
<v Speaker 8>We go on every Monday we talked about</v>
<v Speaker 8>the UFC and then,</v>

635
00:29:03.871 --> 00:29:06.650
<v Speaker 8>and I will lay this back,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the fucking stocks and bonds or whatever</v>

636
00:29:06.651 --> 00:29:10.010
<v Speaker 8>the fuck we're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and then we call away on Friday and</v>

637
00:29:10.011 --> 00:29:13.670
<v Speaker 8>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>The same works for the people I did</v>

638
00:29:13.671 --> 00:29:17.330
<v Speaker 8>crimes with early on.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I still talk to those people because I</v>

639
00:29:17.331 --> 00:29:18.980
<v Speaker 8>went through a weird experience with</v>
<v Speaker 8>that.</v>

640
00:29:19.730 --> 00:29:23.120
<v Speaker 8>Something that you don't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Most people something that,</v>

641
00:29:23.410 --> 00:29:26.690
<v Speaker 8>and they accepted me,</v>
<v Speaker 8>who I'm in front go on before and I,</v>

642
00:29:26.930 --> 00:29:30.380
<v Speaker 8>I talked to this kid timmy,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I will every fucking day at five in the</v>

643
00:29:30.381 --> 00:29:32.780
<v Speaker 8>morning we'd talk.</v>
<v Speaker 8>He was the getaway driver.</v>

644
00:29:32.781 --> 00:29:35.870
<v Speaker 8>When I robbed the jewelry stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I have a loyalty to him,</v>

645
00:29:36.370 --> 00:29:39.830
<v Speaker 8>but we were at a light and the cops came</v>
<v Speaker 8>by and the trunk opened up with a gold</v>

646
00:29:39.831 --> 00:29:41.350
<v Speaker 8>chains.</v>
<v Speaker 8>We both shut up pants.</v>

647
00:29:42.370 --> 00:29:43.300
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

648
00:29:43.330 --> 00:29:46.390
<v Speaker 5>it's something about that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I always had the respect for the</v>

649
00:29:46.391 --> 00:29:49.540
<v Speaker 5>camaraderie.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What gets you through those first six</v>

650
00:29:49.541 --> 00:29:53.780
<v Speaker 5>years of comedy when your life is shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What the fuck gets you through it?</v>

651
00:29:53.781 --> 00:29:56.590
<v Speaker 5>We'll get you through.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We were just talking about it right when</v>

<v Speaker 5>that's the best part of comedy.</v>

658
00:30:14.830 --> 00:30:16.120
<v Speaker 5>It's hard to believe,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

659
00:30:16.150 --> 00:30:18.550
<v Speaker 5>That's the batch part account.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't give a fuck what anybody tells</v>

<v Speaker 5>you.</v>

<v Speaker 5>is when you were brody Stevens in the</v>

00:30:24.611 --> 00:30:27.520
<v Speaker 5>car with Josh Wolfe and I got brody in</v>
<v Speaker 5>the back,</v>

664
00:30:27.521 --> 00:30:32.160
<v Speaker 5>tied up in the fucking back in the Volvo</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I'm doing a hundred with his car and</v>

665

<v Speaker 5>he's yelling,</v>
<v Speaker 5>stop it.</v>

666

<v Speaker 5>Normal people do not live like this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Every time I see droughty I give him a</v>

00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:47.950
<v Speaker 5>Barely.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

692
00:31:47.951 --> 00:31:49.300
<v Speaker 5>we were rookies,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

693
00:31:49.330 --> 00:31:51.670
<v Speaker 5>we were fucking rookies.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And in Boston,</v>

694
00:31:51.671 --> 00:31:54.490
<v Speaker 5>if you could string together 20 minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they had so many rooms.</v>

695
00:31:54.730 --> 00:31:56.770
<v Speaker 5>Everybody was working.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was crazy.</v>

696
00:31:57.010 --> 00:31:59.020
<v Speaker 5>What are you able to have fun during</v>
<v Speaker 5>that time?</v>

697
00:31:59.021 --> 00:32:00.850
<v Speaker 5>Or was a yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fucking great.</v>

698
00:32:01.330 --> 00:32:02.950
<v Speaker 5>Unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So fun.</v>

699
00:32:03.190 --> 00:32:04.450
<v Speaker 5>But I was like terrified.</v>

700
00:32:04.450 --> 00:32:08.170
<v Speaker 5>It wasn't going to work out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Terrified that I was wasting my time.</v>

701
00:32:08.300 --> 00:32:09.970
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>cause it was a big chance.</v>

702
00:32:10.630 --> 00:32:13.840
<v Speaker 5>I quit everything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I knew I'd been papers or something like</v>

703
00:32:13.841 --> 00:32:15.610
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I kept delivering papers,</v>

704
00:32:15.850 --> 00:32:20.710
<v Speaker 5>but I quit teaching at Boston University</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I quit teaching classes.</v>

705
00:32:21.450 --> 00:32:22.450
<v Speaker 5>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to do it.</v>

706
00:32:22.660 --> 00:32:25.450
<v Speaker 5>I said I don't want to half asset and</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not thinking about it the way I used</v>

707
00:32:25.451 --> 00:32:29.710
<v Speaker 5>to think about it when I was teaching</v>
<v Speaker 5>before it was like it was a,</v>

708
00:32:29.770 --> 00:32:32.980
<v Speaker 5>it was life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was teaching life and I was teaching,</v>

709
00:32:33.020 --> 00:32:35.320
<v Speaker 5>well you know people kicking and</v>
<v Speaker 5>punching.</v>

710
00:32:35.350 --> 00:32:38.410
<v Speaker 5>It was like as important as life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was everything.</v>

711
00:32:38.411 --> 00:32:42.500
<v Speaker 5>I was thinking constantly about</v>
<v Speaker 5>techniques and movements and strategies</v>

712
00:32:42.501 --> 00:32:46.310
<v Speaker 5>and constantly and so when I was</v>
<v Speaker 5>teaching people I wanted people to be as</v>

713
00:32:46.311 --> 00:32:50.000
<v Speaker 5>into it as I was and if they weren't I</v>
<v Speaker 5>really wasn't into it that they were,</v>

714
00:32:50.001 --> 00:32:53.060
<v Speaker 5>I I like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I had a bunch of students that I took up</v>

715
00:32:53.061 --> 00:32:55.190
<v Speaker 5>to like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>pretty good level,</v>

716
00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:56.240
<v Speaker 5>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

717
00:32:56.420 --> 00:32:59.210
<v Speaker 5>below black belt but pretty good level</v>
<v Speaker 5>where they're getting really good and</v>

718
00:32:59.211 --> 00:33:00.260
<v Speaker 5>starting to win tournaments.</v>

719
00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:02.690
<v Speaker 5>It was really exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was doing all this,</v>

720
00:33:02.691 --> 00:33:07.691
<v Speaker 5>like from the time I was like 19 to 21</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I'm so teaching and competing at the</v>

721
00:33:08.301 --> 00:33:12.890
<v Speaker 5>same time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And when I first started doing comedy,</v>

722
00:33:12.891 --> 00:33:14.630
<v Speaker 5>I was really,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I realized right away I was like,</v>

723
00:33:14.631 --> 00:33:16.100
<v Speaker 5>I got to quit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I coulda quit everything.</v>

724
00:33:16.220 --> 00:33:17.890
<v Speaker 5>I just got to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it was like,</v>

725
00:33:17.891 --> 00:33:20.990
<v Speaker 5>it was such a fucking leap man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Every Gig,</v>

726
00:33:20.991 --> 00:33:22.220
<v Speaker 5>I was terrified.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

727
00:33:22.221 --> 00:33:24.230
<v Speaker 5>is this stupid thing I'm doing?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look,</v>

728
00:33:24.231 --> 00:33:26.780
<v Speaker 5>what am I retarded?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why the fuck I think I'm funny?</v>

729
00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:31.250
<v Speaker 5>One thing I can get people to pay me to</v>
<v Speaker 5>talk and I'd see the guys that were</v>

730
00:33:31.251 --> 00:33:33.890
<v Speaker 5>doing and in town,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the guys that were making it,</v>

731
00:33:33.891 --> 00:33:36.710
<v Speaker 5>and it was just like they feel,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they felt just out of reach,</v>

732
00:33:36.890 --> 00:33:39.310
<v Speaker 5>just just out of reach.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you never know,</v>

733
00:33:39.340 --> 00:33:41.160
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then you'd go and you'd do some Gig</v>

734
00:33:41.161 --> 00:33:42.890
<v Speaker 5>in Maine and get heckled and eat dick.</v>

735
00:33:43.330 --> 00:33:46.070
<v Speaker 5>He's fucking Obama stage.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they'd go,</v>

736
00:33:46.071 --> 00:33:48.860
<v Speaker 5>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what else could I do if this doesn't</v>

737
00:33:48.861 --> 00:33:49.940
<v Speaker 5>work out?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What else could I do?</v>

738
00:33:50.810 --> 00:33:52.700
<v Speaker 5>Because there was nothing else you</v>
<v Speaker 5>wanted to do.</v>

739
00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:55.250
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would go home at night after a bombing</v>

740
00:33:55.251 --> 00:33:58.720
<v Speaker 5>and just cry and I'd circle.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They used to have just for the labs and</v>

741
00:33:58.730 --> 00:34:00.200
<v Speaker 5>newspaper.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

742
00:34:00.490 --> 00:34:03.770
<v Speaker 5>I remember that section.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It had all the clubs state by state,</v>

743
00:34:03.771 --> 00:34:06.320
<v Speaker 5>Alabama,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I would circle the clubs.</v>

744
00:34:06.321 --> 00:34:09.470
<v Speaker 5>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to show them some day</v>

745
00:34:11.150 --> 00:34:14.500
<v Speaker 5>show that</v>
<v Speaker 5>Birmingham,</v>

746
00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:16.680
<v Speaker 5>but I'm going to go to see,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I love the ground and,</v>

747
00:34:17.060 --> 00:34:18.560
<v Speaker 5>and one day event.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you're like,</v>

748
00:34:18.561 --> 00:34:20.510
<v Speaker 5>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it's so weird that there's so many</v>

749
00:34:20.511 --> 00:34:22.130
<v Speaker 5>things I'm alive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You could pay for.</v>

750
00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:25.780
<v Speaker 5>You can't pay for love and you can't pay</v>
<v Speaker 5>for Camaraderie.</v>

751
00:34:25.790 --> 00:34:28.280
<v Speaker 5>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's something about a camaraderie,</v>

752
00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:30.350
<v Speaker 5>a real camaraderie.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He didn't like.</v>

753
00:34:30.351 --> 00:34:32.740
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes when you go to Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when this guy fucking design,</v>

754
00:34:32.810 --> 00:34:34.490
<v Speaker 5>yet he taps you at the end.</v>

755
00:34:34.490 --> 00:34:36.530
<v Speaker 5>You get up and you hug them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You go,</v>

756
00:34:36.531 --> 00:34:37.490
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that was great.</v>

757
00:34:37.491 --> 00:34:40.400
<v Speaker 5>You sweat my face.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jesus Christ.</v>

758
00:34:40.430 --> 00:34:42.410
<v Speaker 5>I could smell the cheeseburger from last</v>
<v Speaker 5>night.</v>

759
00:34:42.940 --> 00:34:45.530
<v Speaker 5>And that's come out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can't pay for that.</v>

760
00:34:45.830 --> 00:34:47.810
<v Speaker 5>But it's weird that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>listen,</v>

761
00:34:47.811 --> 00:34:50.180
<v Speaker 5>if you're running with people everyday</v>
<v Speaker 5>and they got your back,</v>

762
00:34:50.390 --> 00:34:52.600
<v Speaker 5>I can't imagine that camaraderie.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's real.</v>

763
00:34:52.770 --> 00:34:53.561
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So what about,</v>

764
00:34:53.561 --> 00:34:57.140
<v Speaker 5>what were the comradery that we're</v>
<v Speaker 5>talking about that this makes you</v>

765
00:34:57.141 --> 00:35:01.760
<v Speaker 5>understand like what the story about</v>
<v Speaker 5>these guys that want to go back?</v>

766
00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:04.520
<v Speaker 5>You know like the movie hurt locker,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

767
00:35:04.521 --> 00:35:07.400
<v Speaker 5>but that's what's different because that</v>
<v Speaker 5>guy was kind of addicted to Dis</v>

768
00:35:07.430 --> 00:35:08.780
<v Speaker 5>disarming bombs,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

769
00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:09.651
<v Speaker 5>The dude,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the other one,</v>

770
00:35:09.651 --> 00:35:12.310
<v Speaker 5>the Clint Eastwood one American sniper.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh right.</v>

771
00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:14.390
<v Speaker 5>Goes back and she couldn't figure it</v>
<v Speaker 5>out.</v>

772
00:35:14.391 --> 00:35:16.340
<v Speaker 5>Why do you keep going?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What the fuck did you won't shut the</v>

773
00:35:16.341 --> 00:35:19.070
<v Speaker 5>fuck off because you won't shut the fuck</v>
<v Speaker 5>up.</v>

774
00:35:19.220 --> 00:35:20.960
<v Speaker 5>And this kid,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what's going on.</v>

775
00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:22.640
<v Speaker 5>Let me go over that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>At least kill people.</v>

776
00:35:22.641 --> 00:35:25.640
<v Speaker 5>Because then you feel,</v>
<v Speaker 5>can you imagine Joe Rogan?</v>

777
00:35:26.270 --> 00:35:29.360
<v Speaker 5>Like all your life you got thrown out of</v>
<v Speaker 5>school.</v>

778
00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:34.400
<v Speaker 5>You know you're fucking your mechanic,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you'll laws,</v>

779
00:35:34.401 --> 00:35:38.130
<v Speaker 5>but all of a sudden you realize you're</v>
<v Speaker 5>going take alive.</v>

780
00:35:39.230 --> 00:35:41.610
<v Speaker 8>You have to think of that.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You would put yourself in that position</v>

781
00:35:41.611 --> 00:35:44.760
<v Speaker 8>when you're 18 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 8>19 years old,</v>

782
00:35:44.761 --> 00:35:49.761
<v Speaker 8>you're in Vietnam and you realize that</v>
<v Speaker 8>you're taking your first tour back to</v>

783
00:35:50.041 --> 00:35:52.170
<v Speaker 8>the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Now you finished your year,</v>

784
00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:54.980
<v Speaker 8>but you survive the 11 that went over</v>
<v Speaker 8>this,</v>

785
00:35:54.981 --> 00:35:57.990
<v Speaker 8>six of them laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Then you survive and then reality in</v>

786
00:35:57.991 --> 00:36:02.991
<v Speaker 8>God's eyes you got 18 kills.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Nobody knows that as like a 19 year old.</v>

787
00:36:03.151 --> 00:36:08.151
<v Speaker 8>Now you go back to civilization</v>
<v Speaker 8>and you've got to get paid 10 bucks an</v>

788
00:36:08.510 --> 00:36:13.020
<v Speaker 8>hour to change tires.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Why do you think for years I kept</v>

789
00:36:13.021 --> 00:36:18.021
<v Speaker 8>selling coke because nothing really can</v>
<v Speaker 8>compare to that excitement,</v>

790
00:36:18.481 --> 00:36:20.770
<v Speaker 8>excitement,</v>
<v Speaker 8>excitement of doing something and I'm</v>

791
00:36:20.780 --> 00:36:21.990
<v Speaker 8>supposed to do,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm going to,</v>

792
00:36:21.991 --> 00:36:25.560
<v Speaker 8>I'm going to go sit with my wife and</v>
<v Speaker 8>drink mint juleps with her fucking</v>

793
00:36:25.561 --> 00:36:27.750
<v Speaker 8>family.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I could be killing motherfuckers right</v>

794
00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:30.040
<v Speaker 8>now.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You know?</v>

<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know you get that rally that you get</v>

796
00:36:32.701 --> 00:36:36.240
<v Speaker 8>a lot of love for doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's like you get love and respect from</v>

797
00:36:36.241 --> 00:36:38.700
<v Speaker 8>the people that you work with for doing</v>
<v Speaker 8>your job correctly.</v>

798
00:36:38.730 --> 00:36:41.730

00:36:59.251 --> 00:37:02.070
<v Speaker 8>system has already been set.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They can't get you to kill and forget,</v>

806
00:37:02.340 --> 00:37:05.580
<v Speaker 8>but an 18 year old who rob,</v>
<v Speaker 8>she had blood free.</v>

807
00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:08.250

<v Speaker 8>but their fleet.</v>

809
00:37:16.310 --> 00:37:19.860
<v Speaker 8>I thought about that.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Can you imagine coming back here at 25</v>

810
00:37:19.861 --> 00:37:22.740
<v Speaker 8>and now you've got to work at a bakery?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Couldn't imagine good luck.</v>

811
00:37:22.741 --> 00:37:27.030
<v Speaker 8>1250 an hour and you get two weeks a</v>
<v Speaker 8>year of me and my all you're dreaming</v>

812
00:37:27.031 --> 00:37:32.031
<v Speaker 8>about his fucking putting makeup on and</v>
<v Speaker 8>I treat with ropes with a machine gun</v>

813
00:37:32.311 --> 00:37:36.990
<v Speaker 8>and a gun and knives a whole,</v>
<v Speaker 8>how much work do you think they'd put</v>

814
00:37:36.991 --> 00:37:41.940
<v Speaker 8>into Red Justin guys,</v>
<v Speaker 8>those first reacclimating them back into</v>

815
00:37:41.941 --> 00:37:44.760
<v Speaker 8>society after.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You don't want me to tell you the</v>

816
00:37:44.761 --> 00:37:46.590
<v Speaker 8>problems we have.</v>
<v Speaker 8>We don't,</v>

817
00:37:46.620 --> 00:37:49.500
<v Speaker 8>we can't do it effectively.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's like a guy getting out of prison</v>

818
00:37:49.501 --> 00:37:53.880
<v Speaker 8>after 20 years.</v>
<v Speaker 8>We haven't figured out a way to do it</v>

819
00:37:53.881 --> 00:37:57.780
<v Speaker 8>effectively yet that there's no mishaps.</v>
<v Speaker 8>There's always gonna be a small</v>

820
00:37:57.781 --> 00:38:00.870
<v Speaker 8>percentage for this guy in Houston.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yesterday did four tours.</v>

821
00:38:02.190 --> 00:38:03.240
<v Speaker 8>How old was he,</v>
<v Speaker 8>Jamie</v>

822
00:38:05.370 --> 00:38:06.180
<v Speaker 8>for tours?</v>

823
00:38:06.180 --> 00:38:08.640
<v Speaker 8>What the fuck are you going to do in</v>
<v Speaker 8>this?</v>

824
00:38:08.650 --> 00:38:11.010
<v Speaker 8>The United States,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's going to give you that unless you</v>

825
00:38:11.011 --> 00:38:13.140
<v Speaker 8>go on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Even that,</v>

826
00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:15.510
<v Speaker 8>even that,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's nothing in comparison.</v>

827
00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:17.940
<v Speaker 8>You said earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 8>like how crazy our brains are.</v>

828
00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:22.620
<v Speaker 8>It's crazy how different.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Like when I was 18 it was 2007 I got</v>

829
00:38:22.660 --> 00:38:26.250
<v Speaker 8>just graduating high school,</v>
<v Speaker 8>so like Iraq and Afghanistan were blown</v>

830
00:38:26.251 --> 00:38:27.900
<v Speaker 8>away.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It was right at that time and I had</v>

831
00:38:27.901 --> 00:38:31.980
<v Speaker 8>friends who went over but might like</v>
<v Speaker 8>what you are saying is exciting.</v>

832
00:38:32.690 --> 00:38:36.100
<v Speaker 8>What I would want to wait from that.</v>
<v Speaker 8>There's no part of one five</v>

833
00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:38.290
<v Speaker 1>years old for toys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

834
00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:40.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well you're a smart guy,</v>

835
00:38:40.421 --> 00:38:42.310
<v Speaker 1>Lee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

836
00:38:42.340 --> 00:38:43.840
<v Speaker 1>but they're smart people there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's like,</v>

837
00:38:44.260 --> 00:38:48.970
<v Speaker 1>oh it's just people that are willing to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do the stuff that's more dangerous</v>

838
00:38:48.971 --> 00:38:52.870
<v Speaker 1>because it feels better because it feels</v>
<v Speaker 1>like even though there's risk involved,</v>

839
00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:58.200
<v Speaker 1>at least you feel charged up and alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a life of excitement versus a</v>

840
00:38:59.081 --> 00:39:00.910
<v Speaker 1>life of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

841
00:39:01.750 --> 00:39:05.230
<v Speaker 1>why do you think people climb rocks?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'd climb Brock's cause it's actually</v>

842
00:39:05.231 --> 00:39:07.150
<v Speaker 1>enjoyable climbing a rock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

843
00:39:07.151 --> 00:39:11.440
<v Speaker 1>they climb a rock cause it's fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>scary and you don't know if you can make</v>

844
00:39:11.441 --> 00:39:13.420
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You pretty sure you're to make it.</v>

845
00:39:13.421 --> 00:39:18.421
<v Speaker 1>But there's a real risk that you get a</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking hand spasm and you use this fall</v>

846
00:39:18.820 --> 00:39:22.990
<v Speaker 1>for a long time until you splatter on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bottom.</v>

847
00:39:23.320 --> 00:39:25.720
<v Speaker 1>When you watch someone crazy like Alex</v>
<v Speaker 1>honnold,</v>

848
00:39:25.780 --> 00:39:27.190
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The guy with no ropes,</v>

849
00:39:27.490 --> 00:39:28.600
<v Speaker 1>it does it with no ropes.</v>

850
00:39:28.870 --> 00:39:31.270
<v Speaker 1>We had them in the podcast is super nice</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy.</v>

851
00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:33.010
<v Speaker 1>Real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>real interesting guy.</v>

852
00:39:33.100 --> 00:39:35.950
<v Speaker 1>Lives out of a van,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just travels around in climbs rocks.</v>

853
00:39:36.160 --> 00:39:39.400
<v Speaker 1>He's an adrenaline junkie kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The climbing of the Rock,</v>

854
00:39:39.401 --> 00:39:42.850
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I guess it's Kinda cool to be up</v>

855
00:39:42.851 --> 00:39:46.870
<v Speaker 1>high and it's sort of like a version of</v>
<v Speaker 1>hiking for him cause he can kind of make</v>

856
00:39:46.871 --> 00:39:48.990
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what's really going on is you,</v>

857
00:39:48.991 --> 00:39:52.480
<v Speaker 1>you recognize that you are on the edge</v>
<v Speaker 1>always.</v>

858
00:39:52.780 --> 00:39:55.450
<v Speaker 1>And so even if you're not like your</v>
<v Speaker 1>adrenaline's not flying,</v>

859
00:39:55.451 --> 00:39:57.850
<v Speaker 1>you're not freaking out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're heart's not pounding your</v>

860
00:39:57.851 --> 00:40:01.240
<v Speaker 1>heightened focus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Incense is keenly aware that you're</v>

861
00:40:01.241 --> 00:40:06.100
<v Speaker 1>holding back a waterfall of adrenaline.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're keeping it together.</v>

862
00:40:06.101 --> 00:40:08.980
<v Speaker 1>And so you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of times guys that are doing like</v>

863
00:40:08.981 --> 00:40:11.380
<v Speaker 1>crazy shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like tight rope walking and stuff like</v>

864
00:40:11.381 --> 00:40:12.460
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're,</v>

865
00:40:12.490 --> 00:40:16.240
<v Speaker 1>they're sort of addicted to trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>control</v>

866
00:40:18.140 --> 00:40:21.050
<v Speaker 1>what is this guy doing jamie?</v>

<v Speaker 1>He's still doing it on the edge.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Like I get it.</v>

919
00:42:56.060 --> 00:42:58.010
<v Speaker 5>Like that's how people get better.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They do guest spots,</v>

920
00:42:58.011 --> 00:43:01.100
<v Speaker 5>but that should be something that</v>
<v Speaker 5>somebody asks you for.</v>

921
00:43:01.470 --> 00:43:03.950
<v Speaker 5>It's you know like would you like to do</v>
<v Speaker 5>a guest spot like that?</v>

922
00:43:04.010 --> 00:43:09.010
<v Speaker 5>You know like check you out on stage in</v>
<v Speaker 5>front of 3000 people but to like ask to</v>

923
00:43:09.351 --> 00:43:12.420
<v Speaker 5>do that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like cause we all know like some comics</v>

924
00:43:12.421 --> 00:43:14.480
<v Speaker 5>that are weird,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they'll like show up at your shows and</v>

925
00:43:14.481 --> 00:43:15.570
<v Speaker 5>asked to do guest spot.</v>

926
00:43:15.570 --> 00:43:17.120
<v Speaker 5>I'm like God I didn't know you were here</v>
<v Speaker 5>tonight.</v>

927
00:43:17.150 --> 00:43:20.540
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm just driving your backspace fucking</v>

928
00:43:20.541 --> 00:43:23.260
<v Speaker 5>Ontario often young and you didn't know</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was here tonight.</v>

929
00:43:23.300 --> 00:43:27.200
<v Speaker 5>You don't see my name out there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I made a rule about two years ago.</v>

930
00:43:27.230 --> 00:43:29.600
<v Speaker 5>I love comedians.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know what it is to be a comic.</v>

931
00:43:30.140 --> 00:43:33.800
<v Speaker 5>So I'll tell you what I do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know what it was like for me to</v>

932
00:43:33.830 --> 00:43:38.540
<v Speaker 5>feature until he that $400 for rent and</v>
<v Speaker 5>want to say that you get a call the week</v>

933
00:43:38.540 --> 00:43:40.160
<v Speaker 5>before it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The headline is bringing a feature I</v>

934
00:43:40.161 --> 00:43:41.390
<v Speaker 5>get,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so I made a deal.</v>

935
00:43:42.020 --> 00:43:46.730
<v Speaker 5>I won't bring a lot of features,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I'm not doing guest spots and the</v>

936
00:43:46.731 --> 00:43:49.610
<v Speaker 5>word gets out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's so crazy.</v>

937
00:43:49.611 --> 00:43:52.400
<v Speaker 5>The word really gets out when you don't</v>
<v Speaker 5>do guest spots,</v>

938
00:43:52.430 --> 00:43:54.200
<v Speaker 5>people don't show up to your shows no</v>
<v Speaker 5>more.</v>

939
00:43:54.620 --> 00:43:56.360
<v Speaker 5>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't want them.</v>

940
00:43:56.450 --> 00:43:59.810
<v Speaker 5>Whereas before they were showing up and</v>
<v Speaker 5>you they want to hang out in the green</v>

941
00:43:59.811 --> 00:44:03.860
<v Speaker 5>room and here's my philosophy on it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you're so funny,</v>

942
00:44:03.861 --> 00:44:05.610
<v Speaker 5>you wouldn't be here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Get,</v>

943
00:44:05.700 --> 00:44:06.700
<v Speaker 5>go get onstage.</v>

944
00:44:08.810 --> 00:44:12.020
<v Speaker 5>And you know people come to the green</v>
<v Speaker 5>rooms and they want to hang out and</v>

945
00:44:12.021 --> 00:44:14.420
<v Speaker 5>that's great.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I love seeing my old friends and stuff,</v>

946
00:44:14.421 --> 00:44:17.750
<v Speaker 5>but I'm working right now and you're not</v>
<v Speaker 5>working well,</v>

947
00:44:17.751 --> 00:44:20.810
<v Speaker 5>not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't have to be on that show.</v>

948
00:44:20.870 --> 00:44:22.700
<v Speaker 5>Here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like I,</v>

949
00:44:22.900 --> 00:44:24.770
<v Speaker 5>when I was a kid and that was a starting</v>
<v Speaker 5>out,</v>

950
00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:27.620
<v Speaker 5>I love going to shows.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I still love going to shows.</v>

951
00:44:27.770 --> 00:44:30.020
<v Speaker 5>I don't have to be on stage to enjoy a</v>
<v Speaker 5>show.</v>

952
00:44:30.350 --> 00:44:32.660
<v Speaker 5>So if I go to show,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then I'm like trying to get a guest spot</v>

953
00:44:32.661 --> 00:44:33.930
<v Speaker 5>on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Someone's showing don't even know that</v>

954
00:44:33.931 --> 00:44:37.620
<v Speaker 5>person or barely know that person.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's fucking weird.</v>

955
00:44:37.621 --> 00:44:39.960
<v Speaker 5>I never did that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know anybody who did that.</v>

956
00:44:40.020 --> 00:44:44.370
<v Speaker 5>None of us did that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You either got asked or you just kept</v>

957
00:44:44.371 --> 00:44:46.500
<v Speaker 5>working.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He kept doing shows that were at your</v>

958
00:44:46.501 --> 00:44:47.760
<v Speaker 5>level until you got better.</v>

959
00:44:48.120 --> 00:44:51.030
<v Speaker 5>That's just what everybody does.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like this guest Bot thing,</v>

960
00:44:51.031 --> 00:44:55.050
<v Speaker 5>like that is not how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can't just show up and get on in</v>

961
00:44:55.051 --> 00:45:00.051
<v Speaker 5>front of a couple thousand people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't have two gigs the night I lied</v>

962
00:45:00.241 --> 00:45:02.520
<v Speaker 5>to you because I knew you were going to</v>
<v Speaker 5>ask me to come over to the ice house,</v>

963
00:45:04.100 --> 00:45:06.510
<v Speaker 5>but I know you're working.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

964
00:45:06.740 --> 00:45:08.660
<v Speaker 5>but I don't care what else.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't want them disrupting.</v>

965
00:45:08.750 --> 00:45:13.290
<v Speaker 5>Oh that's very kind of you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I sometimes I go to the ice house</v>

966
00:45:13.710 --> 00:45:16.080
<v Speaker 5>and there's 18 guys up before you and I</v>
<v Speaker 5>go,</v>

967
00:45:16.081 --> 00:45:20.460
<v Speaker 5>this isn't right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This pool guy did a all with justice and</v>

968
00:45:20.461 --> 00:45:22.520
<v Speaker 5>now motherfuckers are doing 20 in front</v>
<v Speaker 5>of me,</v>

969
00:45:22.521 --> 00:45:24.120
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I go up there and the weight he gets</v>

970
00:45:24.121 --> 00:45:27.840
<v Speaker 5>mad at me because I noticed like the</v>
<v Speaker 5>feel when I get to the fucking club.</v>

971
00:45:27.841 --> 00:45:30.960
<v Speaker 5>But I'm ready to go steams coming out of</v>
<v Speaker 5>my nose.</v>

972
00:45:30.960 --> 00:45:34.320
<v Speaker 5>I got to eat two stars to calm me down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I already ate,</v>

973
00:45:34.321 --> 00:45:36.330
<v Speaker 5>I worked out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm fired up.</v>

974
00:45:36.331 --> 00:45:40.680
<v Speaker 5>I gotta wait two or three fucking comics</v>
<v Speaker 5>now the last 15 minutes I'm pacing back</v>

975
00:45:40.681 --> 00:45:42.870
<v Speaker 5>there like a fucking animal,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

976
00:45:42.900 --> 00:45:46.170
<v Speaker 5>I just want to get up there and do my</v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking thing and now I got to wait.</v>

977
00:45:46.350 --> 00:45:49.710
<v Speaker 5>And it's not that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just that some comedians come into</v>

978
00:45:49.711 --> 00:45:53.670
<v Speaker 5>a room to ruin the show,</v>
<v Speaker 5>blow this fucking place up and they</v>

979
00:45:53.671 --> 00:45:56.460
<v Speaker 5>really blow away.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When I get down Thursday you work with</v>

980
00:45:56.461 --> 00:45:58.380
<v Speaker 5>the other two guys,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you get the niche,</v>

981
00:45:58.381 --> 00:46:01.440
<v Speaker 5>you see who you're already working with.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then some guy wants to come in</v>

982
00:46:01.441 --> 00:46:02.490
<v Speaker 5>Saturday like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh my God,</v>

983
00:46:02.491 --> 00:46:04.130
<v Speaker 5>I didn't know you went down because I do</v>
<v Speaker 5>it guest,</v>

984
00:46:04.150 --> 00:46:07.520
<v Speaker 5>it's not going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Especially Saturday cause he got to show</v>

985
00:46:07.521 --> 00:46:09.270
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've got two shows especially fucking</v>

986
00:46:09.271 --> 00:46:10.104
<v Speaker 5>Friday.</v>

987
00:46:10.350 --> 00:46:13.350
<v Speaker 5>And it's like my heart goes out to you</v>
<v Speaker 5>as a comic.</v>

988
00:46:13.351 --> 00:46:15.060
<v Speaker 5>I know what it is to be a struggling</v>
<v Speaker 5>comic,</v>

989
00:46:15.450 --> 00:46:20.190
<v Speaker 5>but there's nothing going on here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But who does let guys to guest sets?</v>

990
00:46:20.520 --> 00:46:22.770
<v Speaker 5>Who does what?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What does a lot of Comedians,</v>

991
00:46:22.771 --> 00:46:25.440
<v Speaker 5>national headlines or just let the local</v>
<v Speaker 5>guys do guests sets.</v>

992
00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:29.490
<v Speaker 5>I Dunno and don't you have to worry</v>
<v Speaker 5>about like putting on a good show?</v>

993
00:46:29.730 --> 00:46:32.280
<v Speaker 5>Like if you put it on a guy who was</v>
<v Speaker 5>terrible and they would just ruin the</v>

994
00:46:32.281 --> 00:46:34.250
<v Speaker 5>show.</v>
<v Speaker 5>These people paid a lot of money first.</v>

995
00:46:34.251 --> 00:46:36.810
<v Speaker 5>So I will let someone have a guest spot</v>
<v Speaker 5>once.</v>

996
00:46:37.080 --> 00:46:37.920
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

997
00:46:38.100 --> 00:46:38.933
<v Speaker 5>this was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

998
00:46:39.260 --> 00:46:41.090
<v Speaker 5>on a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a show with like in one of those ice</v>

999
00:46:41.091 --> 00:46:45.210
<v Speaker 5>house type shows,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like 10 people on and he bombed so bad</v>

1000
00:46:45.630 --> 00:46:49.230
<v Speaker 5>that it tanked the rest of the night</v>
<v Speaker 5>because the people had to sit through 10</v>

1001
00:46:49.231 --> 00:46:53.610
<v Speaker 5>minutes of like really clumsy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>shitty jokes like from someone who like</v>

1002
00:46:53.611 --> 00:46:55.080
<v Speaker 5>barely does comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1003
00:46:55.110 --> 00:46:57.870
<v Speaker 5>I had find out later and then</v>
<v Speaker 5>afterwards,</v>

1004
00:46:57.871 --> 00:47:01.530
<v Speaker 5>like the audience had a lowered</v>
<v Speaker 5>expectation whereas before it'd be like</v>

1005
00:47:01.920 --> 00:47:04.260
<v Speaker 5>Ian Edwards,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Tony Hinchcliffe,</v>

1006
00:47:04.261 --> 00:47:05.550
<v Speaker 5>Tom Segura,</v>
<v Speaker 5>smash,</v>

1007
00:47:05.551 --> 00:47:06.384
<v Speaker 5>smash,</v>
<v Speaker 5>smash.</v>

1008
00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:08.820
<v Speaker 5>And everybody would be experiencing that</v>
<v Speaker 5>all night.</v>

1009
00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:12.510
<v Speaker 5>Well there's this 10 minute gap where it</v>
<v Speaker 5>was just sludge,</v>

1010
00:47:12.690 --> 00:47:17.230
<v Speaker 5>just like really shitty ideas and just</v>
<v Speaker 5>not done well and the audience went</v>

1011
00:47:17.250 --> 00:47:19.920
<v Speaker 5>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like you could see them get super bummed</v>

1012
00:47:19.921 --> 00:47:21.190
<v Speaker 5>out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1013
00:47:21.390 --> 00:47:22.840
<v Speaker 5>Especially when you're on a good show</v>
<v Speaker 5>like that.</v>

1014
00:47:23.340 --> 00:47:26.070
<v Speaker 5>I've been lucky enough to go the past</v>
<v Speaker 5>few weeks to the store.</v>

1015
00:47:26.071 --> 00:47:29.200
<v Speaker 5>But Joey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when it's really good shows it's fun.</v>

1016
00:47:29.201 --> 00:47:31.270
<v Speaker 5>But when there's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I went to a show once and there was a</v>

1017
00:47:31.630 --> 00:47:34.390
<v Speaker 5>magician on this on stage and it just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just,</v>

1018
00:47:34.391 --> 00:47:36.220
<v Speaker 5>I think of him because I know he hates</v>
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>

1019
00:47:36.580 --> 00:47:40.700
<v Speaker 5>but it's so weird how important it is to</v>
<v Speaker 5>build a good show and to build,</v>

1020
00:47:40.701 --> 00:47:43.600
<v Speaker 5>it shows the comics who global</v>
<v Speaker 5>altogether it's,</v>

1021
00:47:43.660 --> 00:47:46.120
<v Speaker 5>you can't just have,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can't just throw a comedian's up</v>

1022
00:47:46.121 --> 00:47:48.550
<v Speaker 5>there and have a good show.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The problem is like people are friends</v>

1023
00:47:48.551 --> 00:47:50.890
<v Speaker 5>with people that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then you know,</v>

1024
00:47:50.950 --> 00:47:51.761
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1025
00:47:51.761 --> 00:47:53.920
<v Speaker 5>you know them and they know you and the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hey man,</v>

1026
00:47:53.921 --> 00:47:55.150
<v Speaker 5>can I do one of those ice house shows?</v>

1027
00:47:55.180 --> 00:47:55.811
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sure.</v>

1028
00:47:55.811 --> 00:47:58.210
<v Speaker 5>Come on down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Doucet I'll say,</v>

1029
00:47:58.840 --> 00:48:00.460
<v Speaker 5>and then you just go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh no,</v>

1030
00:48:00.461 --> 00:48:03.670
<v Speaker 5>what has happened here?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jesus fucking Christ.</v>

1031
00:48:04.180 --> 00:48:06.460
<v Speaker 5>And if you do that like this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this guy,</v>

1032
00:48:06.461 --> 00:48:09.820
<v Speaker 5>like it's written jokes that day and was</v>
<v Speaker 5>doing them that night.</v>

1033
00:48:09.821 --> 00:48:11.580
<v Speaker 5>He had never done them before.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

1034
00:48:11.581 --> 00:48:14.440
<v Speaker 5>can I try to do like a Ho?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's a long ass story.</v>

1035
00:48:15.010 --> 00:48:19.870
<v Speaker 5>But when that does happen,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the p the audience feels like you fucked</v>

1036
00:48:19.871 --> 00:48:21.040
<v Speaker 5>him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1037
00:48:21.041 --> 00:48:23.890
<v Speaker 5>like people always say like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why would I take the bass comedians on</v>

1038
00:48:23.891 --> 00:48:24.671
<v Speaker 5>the road with me?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

1039
00:48:24.671 --> 00:48:26.710
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wouldn't you want to like stand out</v>

1040
00:48:26.920 --> 00:48:28.150
<v Speaker 5>front of the other comedians?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1041
00:48:28.151 --> 00:48:31.480
<v Speaker 5>the audience feels like you fucked him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then like you've made up for the fact</v>

1042
00:48:31.481 --> 00:48:34.510
<v Speaker 5>that you fucked him by being really</v>
<v Speaker 5>funny for the last hour and 10 minutes.</v>

1043
00:48:34.960 --> 00:48:37.450
<v Speaker 5>But you know you fucked them for the</v>
<v Speaker 5>first 20 minutes.</v>

1044
00:48:37.451 --> 00:48:40.600
<v Speaker 5>If you fill in the blank with the name</v>
<v Speaker 5>of the Comedians,</v>

1045
00:48:40.601 --> 00:48:45.010
<v Speaker 5>there's a bunch of crazy fucking</v>
<v Speaker 5>comedians that will open for other like</v>

1046
00:48:45.011 --> 00:48:47.470
<v Speaker 5>national acts and they don't work</v>
<v Speaker 5>anywhere else.</v>

1047
00:48:47.770 --> 00:48:50.860
<v Speaker 5>They just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the work is like opening acts for big</v>

1048
00:48:50.861 --> 00:48:55.480
<v Speaker 5>time national acts who don't want to be</v>
<v Speaker 5>like showing up on stage.</v>

1049
00:48:55.720 --> 00:48:57.910
<v Speaker 5>They don't want someone going on before</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm being really funny.</v>

1050
00:48:59.140 --> 00:49:02.020
<v Speaker 5>But isn't that the point of the opener</v>
<v Speaker 5>to warm them up?</v>

1051
00:49:02.021 --> 00:49:05.470
<v Speaker 5>Like that's why they have a studio warm</v>
<v Speaker 5>up people for TV shows because they want</v>

1052
00:49:05.471 --> 00:49:10.471
<v Speaker 5>them to have good energy and</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want you to warm him up to a degree</v>

1053
00:49:13.541 --> 00:49:16.870
<v Speaker 5>that you really have to hold back a</v>
<v Speaker 5>little bit because they're the star of</v>

1054
00:49:16.871 --> 00:49:19.120
<v Speaker 5>the show.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This whole stupid.</v>

1055
00:49:19.300 --> 00:49:21.610
<v Speaker 5>I rather we come from the school of</v>
<v Speaker 5>thought.</v>

1056
00:49:21.611 --> 00:49:26.350
<v Speaker 5>We want everybody to be fucking great</v>
<v Speaker 5>because of the guy in front of me is</v>

1057
00:49:26.351 --> 00:49:28.360
<v Speaker 5>fucking great while I'm back there</v>
<v Speaker 5>taking them,</v>

1058
00:49:28.361 --> 00:49:31.390
<v Speaker 5>watching this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to come out throwing 92 miles</v>

1059
00:49:31.391 --> 00:49:34.390
<v Speaker 5>an hour if the guy's in front of me is</v>
<v Speaker 5>lack of days.</v>

1060
00:49:34.530 --> 00:49:37.090
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it happened to me one time where you on</v>

1061
00:49:37.091 --> 00:49:38.800
<v Speaker 5>the road?</v>
<v Speaker 5>We left the gift set up.</v>

1062
00:49:39.310 --> 00:49:42.850
<v Speaker 5>The guy's energy was low.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I W he sucked me in when I went up there</v>

1063
00:49:42.851 --> 00:49:46.450
<v Speaker 5>and bomb because of him because I didn't</v>
<v Speaker 5>want to make him.</v>

1064
00:49:46.570 --> 00:49:48.430
<v Speaker 5>It was so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I said,</v>

1065
00:49:48.440 --> 00:49:52.210
<v Speaker 5>I'm not going to do material now I just</v>
<v Speaker 5>go up to him and talk because it's a bad</v>

1066
00:49:52.211 --> 00:49:54.730
<v Speaker 5>thing that does happen when you watch</v>
<v Speaker 5>really bad comedy,</v>

1067
00:49:54.731 --> 00:49:57.250
<v Speaker 5>like someone who's like really amateur</v>
<v Speaker 5>level comedy.</v>

1068
00:49:57.450 --> 00:50:00.400
<v Speaker 5>It's something weird happens where you</v>
<v Speaker 5>get confused as to what's funny,</v>

1069
00:50:00.401 --> 00:50:03.160
<v Speaker 5>what's not funny.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like it's almost like a</v>

1070
00:50:03.161 --> 00:50:05.800
<v Speaker 5>smokescreen,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like one of the ink things at a squid</v>

1071
00:50:05.801 --> 00:50:06.634
<v Speaker 5>shoots and like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1072
00:50:06.850 --> 00:50:11.850
<v Speaker 5>like you see someone on stage that's</v>
<v Speaker 5>really new and really bad and just you</v>

1073
00:50:13.121 --> 00:50:14.980
<v Speaker 5>got to get out of the room.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like why?</v>

1074
00:50:15.070 --> 00:50:18.670
<v Speaker 5>Like you can,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your mind can get locked into their way</v>

1075
00:50:18.671 --> 00:50:22.060
<v Speaker 5>of thinking because that's what I think</v>
<v Speaker 5>is happening anyway on stage.</v>

1076
00:50:22.360 --> 00:50:24.940
<v Speaker 5>I think the reason why comedy is so</v>
<v Speaker 5>funny,</v>

1077
00:50:25.100 --> 00:50:27.290
<v Speaker 5>it's because you're thinking like that</v>
<v Speaker 5>guy,</v>

1078
00:50:27.530 --> 00:50:28.363
<v Speaker 5>the guys</v>

1079
00:50:28.430 --> 00:50:33.430
<v Speaker 1>taking you for a ride and when you let a</v>
<v Speaker 1>bad comedian take you for a ride,</v>

1080
00:50:33.531 --> 00:50:37.160
<v Speaker 1>like you get stuck in like what they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing on stage.</v>

1081
00:50:37.340 --> 00:50:41.630
<v Speaker 1>Say if they're doing like real obvious</v>
<v Speaker 1>hack material,</v>

1082
00:50:41.660 --> 00:50:43.490
<v Speaker 1>cop donut jokes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1083
00:50:43.520 --> 00:50:46.850

<v Speaker 1>you know that kind of stuff and the</v>

1084
00:50:46.851 --> 00:50:48.610
<v Speaker 1>audience is really laughing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll,</v>

1085
00:50:48.620 --> 00:50:52.260
<v Speaker 1>you'll get confused and your whole set</v>
<v Speaker 1>you like you have to shut him out and</v>

1086
00:50:52.270 --> 00:50:52.641
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

1087
00:50:52.641 --> 00:50:54.530
<v Speaker 1>la La,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got to listen to some music.</v>

1088
00:50:54.531 --> 00:50:57.320
<v Speaker 1>You got to go onstage fresh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they didn't exist.</v>

1089
00:50:57.321 --> 00:51:00.980
<v Speaker 1>You're better off not seeing them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to see him no more.</v>

1090
00:51:01.040 --> 00:51:02.860
<v Speaker 1>I come out like gladiator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Gladia.</v>

1092
00:51:04.851 --> 00:51:08.810
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to get caught up like</v>
<v Speaker 1>Friday or Saturday early show on what's</v>

1093

<v Speaker 1>the other acts and I started getting</v>
<v Speaker 1>into it,</v>

1094
00:51:11.601 --> 00:51:14.850
<v Speaker 1>but until then I want to come out of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>box like a fucking savage.</v>

1095
00:51:14.870 --> 00:51:16.130
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you're working with people that</v>

1096
00:51:16.131 --> 00:51:17.630
<v Speaker 1>you love,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you were doing a show with</v>

1097
00:51:17.631 --> 00:51:19.720
<v Speaker 1>Dunkin and Ari,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd probably watch a lot of their set.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's the cool thing about when we do</v>
<v Speaker 1>the road together,</v>

1100
00:51:23.991 --> 00:51:25.730
<v Speaker 1>we watch each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shit's fun.</v>

1101
00:51:25.910 --> 00:51:28.430
<v Speaker 1>It's like I get to see a show and do a</v>
<v Speaker 1>show,</v>

1102
00:51:28.820 --> 00:51:29.810
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fun.</v>

1103
00:51:30.830 --> 00:51:35.630
<v Speaker 1>I love going to the stores and the back</v>
<v Speaker 1>and laughing me to one of my all time.</v>

1104
00:51:35.631 --> 00:51:38.730
<v Speaker 1>Favorite things to get done a little</v>
<v Speaker 1>early,</v>

1105
00:51:38.810 --> 00:51:43.810
<v Speaker 1>like your spots at 10 45 you get none.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were 10 and you watch a few guys</v>

1106
00:51:44.361 --> 00:51:47.600
<v Speaker 1>and it really gets you in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the swing of things.</v>

1107
00:51:47.601 --> 00:51:48.061
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1108
00:51:48.061 --> 00:51:50.300
<v Speaker 1>it really does get you going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

1109
00:51:50.360 --> 00:51:51.950
<v Speaker 1>But I don't want to sit there all night</v>
<v Speaker 1>either.</v>

1110
00:51:52.610 --> 00:51:53.990
<v Speaker 1>Well that's a cool thing about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>store,</v>

1111
00:51:54.710 --> 00:51:55.040
<v Speaker 1>Zoe.</v>

1112
00:51:55.040 --> 00:51:58.490
<v Speaker 1>Some chose going on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone's three rooms can move around,</v>

1113
00:51:58.760 --> 00:52:02.300
<v Speaker 1>watch a bunch of different shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a not to be taken</v>

1114
00:52:02.301 --> 00:52:03.920
<v Speaker 1>lightly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think with anything.</v>

1115
00:52:04.340 --> 00:52:05.630
<v Speaker 1>I think if you were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1116
00:52:05.660 --> 00:52:07.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you are a knife maker,</v>

1117
00:52:07.220 --> 00:52:08.900
<v Speaker 1>if you are really into making custom</v>
<v Speaker 1>knives,</v>

1118
00:52:08.901 --> 00:52:10.940
<v Speaker 1>you'd want to be around other dudes and</v>
<v Speaker 1>make those things.</v>

1119
00:52:11.180 --> 00:52:13.670
<v Speaker 1>That's why they have those expos where</v>
<v Speaker 1>people get together and they,</v>

1120
00:52:14.090 --> 00:52:15.110
<v Speaker 1>it's what he'd been up to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1121

<v Speaker 1>meteors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where does he get the meteors?</v>

1127

<v Speaker 1>can pull it's receiving and find the</v>

1134
00:52:53.781 --> 00:52:58.781
<v Speaker 1>video cause it's fucking crazy.</v>

<v Speaker 1>what you call it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

<v Speaker 1>So this is making these things sort of</v>

1139
00:53:11.991 --> 00:53:14.060
<v Speaker 1>in a similar way to the way Samurais</v>
<v Speaker 1>made them.</v>

1140
00:53:14.330 --> 00:53:18.470
<v Speaker 1>Well you have big plates of metal and</v>

1142
00:53:20.931 --> 00:53:23.900
<v Speaker 1>smash them and get all the layers into</v>
<v Speaker 1>one layer.</v>

1143
00:53:24.140 --> 00:53:26.280
<v Speaker 1>But it's all done with iron</v>

1144
00:53:26.280 --> 00:53:27.940
<v Speaker 4>that he's getting from fucking media</v>
<v Speaker 4>right now.</v>

1145
00:53:27.960 --> 00:53:30.420
<v Speaker 4>What's the difference between the IMF</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the media rights?</v>

1146
00:53:30.930 --> 00:53:32.040
<v Speaker 4>Just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's cool.</v>

1147
00:53:32.041 --> 00:53:33.990
<v Speaker 4>You could say it's from space.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It makes you,</v>

1148
00:53:34.050 --> 00:53:36.540
<v Speaker 4>so it's not a strong iron or nothing</v>
<v Speaker 4>like that.</v>

1149
00:53:36.541 --> 00:53:39.210
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't last.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think I would,</v>

1150
00:53:39.250 --> 00:53:43.050
<v Speaker 4>as far as I know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's ways to harden iron and</v>

1151
00:53:43.051 --> 00:53:44.700
<v Speaker 4>steel.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What survives coming.</v>

1152
00:53:44.701 --> 00:53:45.980
<v Speaker 4>He'll actually,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

1153
00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:48.270
<v Speaker 4>we're talking about steel,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're making steel,</v>

1154
00:53:48.600 --> 00:53:52.410
<v Speaker 4>but I'm using the iron from space.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1155
00:53:52.411 --> 00:53:55.260
<v Speaker 4>I don't think there's any benefit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's probably just really cool</v>

1156
00:53:55.261 --> 00:53:58.890
<v Speaker 4>looking and awesome to say.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just fucking steal.</v>

1157
00:53:58.980 --> 00:54:00.120
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it is what it is,</v>

1158
00:54:00.390 --> 00:54:00.930
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1159
00:54:00.930 --> 00:54:02.310
<v Speaker 4>Isn't that correct,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jamie?</v>

1160
00:54:02.330 --> 00:54:03.163
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that makes sense.</v>

1161
00:54:03.680 --> 00:54:06.120
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Captain America's shield that they got</v>

1162
00:54:06.121 --> 00:54:08.850
<v Speaker 4>from the right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

1163
00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:12.180
<v Speaker 4>So this dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think his name is Steve Kramer.</v>

1164
00:54:12.870 --> 00:54:13.980
<v Speaker 4>Bob Kramer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>excuse me,</v>

1165
00:54:14.010 --> 00:54:19.010
<v Speaker 4>Bob Kramer and Bob Kramer throws 'em</v>
<v Speaker 4>this giant chunk of metal and it's</v>

1166
00:54:19.891 --> 00:54:21.510
<v Speaker 4>unbelievably hot oven.</v>

1167
00:54:21.810 --> 00:54:25.410
<v Speaker 4>And then he pulls it out and then he</v>
<v Speaker 4>puts it in this machine and hammers it</v>

1168
00:54:25.411 --> 00:54:30.411
<v Speaker 4>and he's just talking about all the</v>
<v Speaker 4>different methods of hardening steel and</v>

1169
00:54:31.770 --> 00:54:34.800
<v Speaker 4>adding carbon and all the things that</v>
<v Speaker 4>they add during the process.</v>

1170
00:54:34.801 --> 00:54:37.830
<v Speaker 4>But it's crazy wild shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1171
00:54:38.780 --> 00:54:40.140
<v Speaker 4>Leave that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he pulls out this</v>

1172
00:54:42.030 --> 00:54:46.500
<v Speaker 4>orange and white glowing thing and they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it pounds it down,</v>

1173
00:54:47.550 --> 00:54:52.550
<v Speaker 4>so he takes it and all those layers get</v>
<v Speaker 4>smashed down into a thinner and thinner</v>

1174
00:54:54.571 --> 00:54:57.960
<v Speaker 4>layer and it just keeps doing it over</v>
<v Speaker 4>and over again until it becomes like a</v>

1175
00:54:57.961 --> 00:55:01.380
<v Speaker 4>blade.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's wild shit man.</v>

1176
00:55:01.560 --> 00:55:06.560
<v Speaker 4>So when it's down to being a blade,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that fucking thing is so compressed and</v>

1177
00:55:07.501 --> 00:55:10.740
<v Speaker 4>smashed down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just really interesting shit.</v>

1178
00:55:10.860 --> 00:55:12.840
<v Speaker 4>So what is the name of the video?</v>

<v Speaker 8>your friend's house asleep over there.</v>

1304
01:01:08.060 --> 01:01:09.680
<v Speaker 8>There was a year I didn't sleep at my</v>
<v Speaker 8>house.</v>

1305
01:01:09.681 --> 01:01:12.020
<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>really like a year when I was in the</v>

1306
01:01:12.021 --> 01:01:14.030
<v Speaker 8>seventh grade,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I didn't sleep in my house.</v>

1307
01:01:14.060 --> 01:01:16.120
<v Speaker 8>Never.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I would go there after school,</v>

1308
01:01:16.150 --> 01:01:18.650
<v Speaker 8>get clothes.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I didn't go to my friends house and</v>

1309
01:01:18.651 --> 01:01:21.800
<v Speaker 8>sleep there and lived there.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I was scared of fucking ghosts and shit.</v>

1310
01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:27.580
<v Speaker 4>My grandparents insisted their house was</v>
<v Speaker 4>haunted data guy.</v>

1311
01:01:27.581 --> 01:01:29.740
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>during the 50s,</v>

1312
01:01:30.040 --> 01:01:33.970
<v Speaker 4>who rented a room upstairs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So local guy was a bachelor and he just</v>

1313
01:01:33.971 --> 01:01:36.400
<v Speaker 4>rented a room because um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1314
01:01:36.430 --> 01:01:39.920
<v Speaker 4>people did that back then they were poor</v>
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>

1315
01:01:39.940 --> 01:01:42.640
<v Speaker 4>that guy died.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think he died while he's at the house.</v>

1316
01:01:42.730 --> 01:01:46.390
<v Speaker 4>I don't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But they insisted that the fucking guy</v>

1317
01:01:46.391 --> 01:01:48.910
<v Speaker 4>was still like walking around.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They'd hear him walk around.</v>

1318
01:01:49.390 --> 01:01:52.390
<v Speaker 4>I lived there for months when I first</v>
<v Speaker 4>moved up to number and shit.</v>

1319
01:01:52.850 --> 01:01:54.670
<v Speaker 4>Then I realized,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what a lot of that is</v>

1320
01:01:56.600 --> 01:01:59.740
<v Speaker 4>people just get bored.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They want there to be a ghost.</v>

1321
01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:02.590
<v Speaker 4>They want something crazy to be going on</v>
<v Speaker 4>their board.</v>

1322
01:02:02.650 --> 01:02:05.890
<v Speaker 4>They don't have any excitement.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so the only excitement is like being</v>

1323
01:02:05.891 --> 01:02:09.780
<v Speaker 4>in that room in the dark and having</v>
<v Speaker 4>feelings about something.</v>

1324
01:02:09.781 --> 01:02:10.614
<v Speaker 4>It's not even real.</v>

1325
01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:12.610

<v Speaker 8>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 8>garage.</v>
<v Speaker 8>All right.</v>

<v Speaker 8>I never knew about this til years later.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Once we moved in Lima.</v>

1351
01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:25.590
<v Speaker 8>In the beginning I was going to Catholic</v>
<v Speaker 8>school,</v>

<v Speaker 5>How did I become a regular person last</v>

1459
01:08:20.510 --> 01:08:22.580
<v Speaker 5>night I was telling him these stories,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so that was shaking.</v>

1460
01:08:23.540 --> 01:08:25.280
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I remember when I first met you,</v>

1461
01:08:25.640 --> 01:08:27.520
<v Speaker 5>you were always a great guy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you will,</v>

1462
01:08:27.570 --> 01:08:29.540
<v Speaker 5>you are way more dangerous like you</v>
<v Speaker 5>were.</v>

1463
01:08:30.200 --> 01:08:32.450
<v Speaker 5>You're a dangerous person.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You could do,</v>

1464
01:08:32.480 --> 01:08:35.570
<v Speaker 5>you could do some ridiculous shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You A,</v>

1465
01:08:35.571 --> 01:08:38.630
<v Speaker 5>you were very volatile.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a part of me that's a very,</v>

1466
01:08:38.631 --> 01:08:43.310
<v Speaker 5>very nice law abiding person that really</v>
<v Speaker 5>is as a part of me,</v>

1467
01:08:43.311 --> 01:08:45.620
<v Speaker 5>that's always one of the try to be a</v>
<v Speaker 5>nice person,</v>

1468
01:08:46.250 --> 01:08:50.060
<v Speaker 5>but there's a part of me that does not</v>
<v Speaker 5>comprehend a part of human behavior</v>

1469
01:08:51.200 --> 01:08:54.950
<v Speaker 5>because it would not be alive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was raised by no means at all.</v>

1470
01:08:55.310 --> 01:08:57.980
<v Speaker 5>What do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just stupid human behavior that I</v>

1471
01:08:57.981 --> 01:08:59.450
<v Speaker 5>see everyday now I wouldn't know.</v>

1472
01:08:59.450 --> 01:09:03.620
<v Speaker 5>I say acceptable and how I was raised or</v>
<v Speaker 5>how the people like rub her work.</v>

1473
01:09:04.280 --> 01:09:07.520
<v Speaker 5>So when I look at that on behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my head explodes.</v>

1474
01:09:08.120 --> 01:09:12.890
<v Speaker 5>I really can't handle it and I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I got a beaten when I was 19.</v>

1475
01:09:12.891 --> 01:09:15.770
<v Speaker 5>That was such a great beaten.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was worse than the one that been on</v>

1476
01:09:15.771 --> 01:09:20.060
<v Speaker 5>Hopkins put on Felix Tryna dread.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's the day I made my decision,</v>

1477
01:09:20.061 --> 01:09:23.020
<v Speaker 5>my hand to hand combat days room like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>God,</v>

1478
01:09:23.030 --> 01:09:27.140
<v Speaker 5>I don't need this shit in my world.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you come into my world and get</v>

1479
01:09:27.200 --> 01:09:28.910
<v Speaker 5>disrespectful,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to hit you with a weapon.</v>

1480
01:09:28.911 --> 01:09:30.560
<v Speaker 5>I'm gonna hit you with a chair or a</v>
<v Speaker 5>bottle.</v>

1481
01:09:30.561 --> 01:09:33.290
<v Speaker 5>I threw a lot of bottles in the store,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a couple of glasses.</v>

1482
01:09:33.291 --> 01:09:34.790
<v Speaker 5>He definitely throw some shit at the</v>
<v Speaker 5>store.</v>

1483
01:09:34.791 --> 01:09:38.330
<v Speaker 5>I don't fuck around with people because</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't like people fucking with me.</v>

1484
01:09:38.330 --> 01:09:40.460
<v Speaker 5>I'm really sensitive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know how to handle it.</v>

1485
01:09:40.970 --> 01:09:41.870
<v Speaker 5>But see,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's,</v>

1486
01:09:42.200 --> 01:09:45.260
<v Speaker 5>it's one of the things we're talking</v>
<v Speaker 5>about when we were talking about um,</v>

1487
01:09:46.280 --> 01:09:49.610
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>p people who go to war and how they get</v>

1488
01:09:49.611 --> 01:09:53.030
<v Speaker 5>addicted to that feeling and then it's</v>
<v Speaker 5>almost like,</v>

1489
01:09:53.031 --> 01:09:55.460
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like that becomes their world.</v>

1490
01:09:55.461 --> 01:09:56.370
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1491
01:09:56.400 --> 01:10:01.070
<v Speaker 5>I almost feel like with,</v>
<v Speaker 5>with some people they become,</v>

1492
01:10:01.640 --> 01:10:05.690
<v Speaker 5>they become like real addicted to like</v>
<v Speaker 5>bad situations.</v>

1493
01:10:05.750 --> 01:10:10.750
<v Speaker 5>I was get addicted to drama is drama.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like you don't know how to handle life</v>

1494
01:10:13.100 --> 01:10:17.420
<v Speaker 5>if there's no drama in your life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was times I would rob Joe Rogan</v>

1495
01:10:17.450 --> 01:10:22.040
<v Speaker 5>knowing that Joe Rogan knew I was on the</v>
<v Speaker 5>rob and my state of mind was not what,</v>

1496
01:10:23.240 --> 01:10:28.240
<v Speaker 5>not what not what</v>
<v Speaker 5>you'd cause and they just,</v>

1497
01:10:28.400 --> 01:10:31.850
<v Speaker 5>I didn't know how to live without the</v>
<v Speaker 5>swirl of danger,</v>

1498
01:10:32.340 --> 01:10:33.680
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and let's be honest,</v>

1499
01:10:33.681 --> 01:10:36.500
<v Speaker 5>the last 10 years I did blow and not</v>
<v Speaker 5>because of an addiction.</v>

1500
01:10:36.530 --> 01:10:41.240
<v Speaker 5>The last 10 years I did blow up because</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was addicted to that state of mind</v>

1501
01:10:41.960 --> 01:10:44.390
<v Speaker 5>were always,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you were always in need of something.</v>

1502
01:10:44.900 --> 01:10:49.040
<v Speaker 5>The thrill was going to get the coat and</v>
<v Speaker 5>driving them with the coke in the car.</v>

1503
01:10:49.460 --> 01:10:50.630
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's something that you,</v>

1504
01:10:50.660 --> 01:10:54.350
<v Speaker 5>when you told me that it was the first</v>
<v Speaker 5>time anybody's ever articulated it that</v>

1505
01:10:54.351 --> 01:10:56.420
<v Speaker 5>way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like what you are addicted to was not</v>

1506
01:10:56.421 --> 01:11:00.000
<v Speaker 5>even necessarily the drug.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's the whole thing.</v>

1507
01:11:00.020 --> 01:11:05.020
<v Speaker 5>The driving and little danger of danger.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Police going to the guy's place to buy</v>

1508
01:11:05.421 --> 01:11:06.260
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the cop,</v>

1509
01:11:06.350 --> 01:11:09.230
<v Speaker 5>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would look at myself after snoring at</v>

1510
01:11:09.231 --> 01:11:12.410
<v Speaker 5>two three in the morning and see this</v>
<v Speaker 5>person I didn't even recognize in the</v>

1511
01:11:12.411 --> 01:11:14.100
<v Speaker 5>mirror.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wouldn't even want to look</v>

1512
01:11:14.100 --> 01:11:18.920
<v Speaker 8>at them cause I was so ashamed that I</v>
<v Speaker 8>let that position take over my mind.</v>

1513
01:11:18.921 --> 01:11:21.600
<v Speaker 8>It wasn't the fact of the call or the</v>
<v Speaker 8>whatever.</v>

1514
01:11:21.610 --> 01:11:24.060
<v Speaker 8>Are they getting my dick sucked or</v>
<v Speaker 8>they're doing dirty things.</v>

1515
01:11:24.660 --> 01:11:29.660
<v Speaker 8>It was the fact that drive and fronting</v>
<v Speaker 8>it and all the scamming that went what?</v>

1516
01:11:31.680 --> 01:11:33.750
<v Speaker 8>And somebody told me when I got locked</v>
<v Speaker 8>up,</v>

1517
01:11:33.751 --> 01:11:35.680
<v Speaker 8>they said,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you think of all the time you put into</v>

1518
01:11:35.700 --> 01:11:40.700
<v Speaker 8>scams thinking that you put that time</v>
<v Speaker 8>into doing something on a positive level</v>

1519
01:11:41.030 --> 01:11:44.340
<v Speaker 8>it,</v>
<v Speaker 8>there's no surprise that my life has</v>

1520
01:11:44.341 --> 01:11:48.900
<v Speaker 8>changed as much as I did without the</v>
<v Speaker 8>drugs because 60% of your mental state</v>

1521
01:11:48.930 --> 01:11:51.390
<v Speaker 8>was always in those drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Don't matter.</v>

1522
01:11:51.391 --> 01:11:55.440
<v Speaker 8>For the other 40 was in comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 8>The other 37 wasn't comedy and the other</v>

1523
01:11:55.441 --> 01:11:57.420
<v Speaker 8>three was in God knows what the fuck it</v>
<v Speaker 8>was.</v>

1524
01:11:57.750 --> 01:12:02.750
<v Speaker 8>But 60% of your day is dominated by that</v>
<v Speaker 8>addiction or whatever drives you and was</v>

1525
01:12:03.900 --> 01:12:06.060
<v Speaker 8>some people,</v>
<v Speaker 8>they've described it as like the</v>

1526
01:12:06.061 --> 01:12:10.200
<v Speaker 8>addiction and having that addiction was</v>
<v Speaker 8>like almost like a built in excuse to</v>

1527
01:12:10.201 --> 01:12:13.110
<v Speaker 8>not live up to their full potential in</v>
<v Speaker 8>anything to try and do.</v>

1528
01:12:13.200 --> 01:12:14.190
<v Speaker 8>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You.</v>

1529
01:12:14.210 --> 01:12:17.690
<v Speaker 8>Oh well for starters it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's,</v>

1530
01:12:17.730 --> 01:12:22.730
<v Speaker 8>it's the personal blame.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You want that just in case if you fail,</v>

1531
01:12:23.580 --> 01:12:26.030
<v Speaker 8>you always have a fucking excuse.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>

1532
01:12:26.100 --> 01:12:28.620
<v Speaker 8>what'd you expect?</v>
<v Speaker 8>I was having those problems those years.</v>

1533
01:12:28.621 --> 01:12:30.630
<v Speaker 8>You didn't have any problem having a</v>
<v Speaker 8>problem is when,</v>

1534
01:12:31.370 --> 01:12:32.700
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

1535
01:12:32.701 --> 01:12:36.240
<v Speaker 8>you get fucking shingled floor or your</v>
<v Speaker 8>family member has cancer.</v>

1536
01:12:36.241 --> 01:12:41.010
<v Speaker 8>That's a problem that happens in life.</v>
<v Speaker 8>The coke and all that shit is your own</v>

1537
01:12:41.011 --> 01:12:42.670
<v Speaker 8>men.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Men made dilemma.</v>

1538
01:12:42.690 --> 01:12:44.850
<v Speaker 8>Are you with me?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Like these are the things you create,</v>

1539
01:12:44.851 --> 01:12:47.010
<v Speaker 8>all these things you create.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>

1540
01:12:47.011 --> 01:12:51.420
<v Speaker 8>I think about that last year I did blow,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I was ready to call 60 minutes.</v>

1541
01:12:52.220 --> 01:12:54.000
<v Speaker 8>Like I think of this state of mind right</v>
<v Speaker 8>now.</v>

1542
01:12:54.480 --> 01:12:57.810
<v Speaker 8>Like I had already a pitch for 60</v>
<v Speaker 8>minutes to explain to them that I had</v>

1543
01:12:57.811 --> 01:13:02.811
<v Speaker 8>found the cure for cocaine.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That if you do heroin on Mondays just a</v>

1544
01:13:03.901 --> 01:13:06.390
<v Speaker 8>little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you will not snort the rest of the week.</v>

1545
01:13:07.140 --> 01:13:08.970
<v Speaker 8>Like I was really going to put 60</v>
<v Speaker 8>minutes.</v>

1546
01:13:08.971 --> 01:13:11.100
<v Speaker 8>I was going to get an agent and go to</v>
<v Speaker 8>CBS and go,</v>

1547
01:13:11.110 --> 01:13:13.140
<v Speaker 8>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I got a groundbreaking idea.</v>

1548
01:13:13.620 --> 01:13:16.260
<v Speaker 8>There's no reason for rehabs.</v>
<v Speaker 8>We'll get that white powder.</v>

1549
01:13:16.261 --> 01:13:17.640
<v Speaker 8>You motherfuckers are going to war for</v>
<v Speaker 8>it</v>

1550
01:13:19.320 --> 01:13:20.900
<v Speaker 8>and we'll get that little white poppy</v>
<v Speaker 8>seed.</v>

1551
01:13:20.901 --> 01:13:24.870
<v Speaker 8>We'll make it into some pill and we'll</v>
<v Speaker 8>get people high on Monday cause the rest</v>

1552
01:13:24.871 --> 01:13:26.160
<v Speaker 8>of the week.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I didn't want to get high.</v>

1553
01:13:26.730 --> 01:13:31.560
<v Speaker 8>How crazy that I was doing heroin on a</v>
<v Speaker 8>Monday and it wouldn't let me do coke</v>

1554
01:13:31.561 --> 01:13:33.740
<v Speaker 8>the rest of the week.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I look forward to Mondays.</v>

1555
01:13:33.750 --> 01:13:36.480
<v Speaker 8>Fuck CSI Miami.</v>

<v Speaker 8>I Dunno.</v>

1557
01:13:39.150 --> 01:13:43.170
<v Speaker 8>I have no fucking idea.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That was just the guy that was just a</v>

1558
01:13:43.171 --> 01:13:44.710
<v Speaker 8>snorting it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

1559
01:13:44.760 --> 01:13:47.720
<v Speaker 8>snoring at two little lines of heroin</v>
<v Speaker 8>just to get me out.</v>

1560
01:13:47.721 --> 01:13:49.530
<v Speaker 8>And what does it do?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Like what's the feeling?</v>

1561
01:13:49.660 --> 01:13:51.810
<v Speaker 8>Hit?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Tell me what it feels like when it hits</v>

1562
01:13:51.811 --> 01:13:54.120
<v Speaker 8>you.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>

1563
01:13:54.121 --> 01:13:57.010
<v Speaker 8>it takes a couple of minutes to hit you</v>
<v Speaker 8>and you feel this weird thing and then</v>

1564
01:13:57.011 --> 01:14:01.540
<v Speaker 8>you feel like your blood pressure going</v>
<v Speaker 8>up and you feel like this euphoric</v>

1565
01:14:02.050 --> 01:14:04.410
<v Speaker 8>warmth.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You feel like this fucking warmth.</v>

1566
01:14:05.290 --> 01:14:07.600
<v Speaker 8>I felt like my body.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Do you ever take a wet shit?</v>

1567
01:14:09.150 --> 01:14:12.400
<v Speaker 8>It's warm and you could see if you shit</v>
<v Speaker 8>outside steams gonna come out of it.</v>

1568
01:14:12.850 --> 01:14:14.890
<v Speaker 8>That's what your body feels like that</v>
<v Speaker 8>warm.</v>

1569
01:14:15.340 --> 01:14:16.960
<v Speaker 8>And then I would get an urge to puke</v>

1570
01:14:18.200 --> 01:14:20.950
<v Speaker 8>for a couple of minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I would gag and Puke a little bit would</v>

1571
01:14:20.951 --> 01:14:23.360
<v Speaker 8>come out of yellow and then after I</v>
<v Speaker 8>puked a little bit,</v>

1572
01:14:23.361 --> 01:14:28.361
<v Speaker 8>I would just go into this state of</v>
<v Speaker 8>fucking Mona's for four hours.</v>

1573
01:14:28.611 --> 01:14:33.611
<v Speaker 8>It was like smoking in because all day</v>
<v Speaker 8>and like just sitting there smoking</v>

1574
01:14:33.651 --> 01:14:36.590
<v Speaker 8>cigarettes,</v>
<v Speaker 8>looking at a window and I'd make believe</v>

1575
01:14:36.591 --> 01:14:41.591
<v Speaker 8>I was writing John Lennon type lyrics to</v>
<v Speaker 8>jokes until I looked at them the next</v>

1576
01:14:42.710 --> 01:14:44.540
<v Speaker 8>day.</v>
<v Speaker 8>This brilliance about a refrigerator.</v>

1577
01:14:44.541 --> 01:14:49.040
<v Speaker 8>Like I remember writing a bit about a</v>
<v Speaker 8>refrigerator once and looking at it the</v>

1578
01:14:49.040 --> 01:14:52.300
<v Speaker 8>next day and say thank God,</v>
<v Speaker 8>thank God I never tried it.</v>

1579
01:14:52.310 --> 01:14:54.080
<v Speaker 8>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Like little things like just,</v>

1580
01:14:54.440 --> 01:14:58.010
<v Speaker 8>well that was hedbergs drug of choice</v>
<v Speaker 8>and his jokes,</v>

01:14:59.530 --> 01:15:00.840
<v Speaker 7>man.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean</v>

1582
01:15:01.120 --> 01:15:03.310

<v Speaker 1>I think he's probably the best</v>

1583
01:15:03.340 --> 01:15:08.140
<v Speaker 1>nonsequitor joke I ever because all his</v>
<v Speaker 1>jokes are unrelated.</v>

1584
01:15:08.410 --> 01:15:09.970
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's a non sequitur.</v>

1585
01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:11.860
<v Speaker 1>Here's some other things I was thinking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

1586
01:15:12.130 --> 01:15:14.680
<v Speaker 1>Here's something I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's how I saw.</v>

1587
01:15:14.950 --> 01:15:17.080
<v Speaker 1>And it was like I was listening to it</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other day.</v>

1588
01:15:17.081 --> 01:15:20.350
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>half of his jokes were only funny</v>

1589
01:15:20.351 --> 01:15:23.290
<v Speaker 1>because he was saying them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1590
01:15:23.560 --> 01:15:28.120
<v Speaker 1>But they were hilarious like he had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had a way of doing it that was kind</v>

1591
01:15:28.121 --> 01:15:30.700
<v Speaker 1>of like heroin comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1818
01:26:10.311 --> 01:26:12.170
<v Speaker 8>society.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Why do they have to put you in a holding</v>

1819
01:26:12.171 --> 01:26:14.750
<v Speaker 8>tank?</v>
<v Speaker 8>What kind of weird formality is that?</v>

1820
01:26:15.140 --> 01:26:16.730
<v Speaker 8>Like sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 8>we have to cuff you.</v>

1821
01:26:17.390 --> 01:26:20.270
<v Speaker 8>Well wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You know I'm not and I have no failure</v>

1822
01:26:20.271 --> 01:26:22.730
<v Speaker 8>to appears like I've,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I've always gone to court.</v>

1823
01:26:22.731 --> 01:26:24.140
<v Speaker 8>I never,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I don't have a failure.</v>

1824
01:26:24.560 --> 01:26:28.760
<v Speaker 8>I even went to court with an alias.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Like I used an alias one time when I got</v>

1825
01:26:28.761 --> 01:26:30.320
<v Speaker 8>arrested,</v>
<v Speaker 8>that's the class I got.</v>

1826
01:26:31.520 --> 01:26:33.620
<v Speaker 8>I covered the spread.</v>
<v Speaker 8>When they arrested me,</v>

1827
01:26:33.621 --> 01:26:36.290
<v Speaker 8>I gave him like Joe Rogan's name and not</v>
<v Speaker 8>so you wouldn't get a warrant.</v>

1828
01:26:36.320 --> 01:26:39.790
<v Speaker 8>I went down and did the 16 hours</v>
<v Speaker 8>community service in the age of unit</v>

1829
01:26:39.800 --> 01:26:42.770
<v Speaker 8>painting for the age people.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So next time you look at me and tell him</v>

1830
01:26:42.771 --> 01:26:45.230
<v Speaker 8>he ain't got no fucking character,</v>
<v Speaker 8>think of that.</v>

1831
01:26:45.530 --> 01:26:47.720
<v Speaker 8>And 10 years later I go to eat dinner</v>
<v Speaker 8>with that guy and he's like,</v>

1832
01:26:47.721 --> 01:26:49.610
<v Speaker 8>can I have a Tan?</v>
<v Speaker 8>I got pulled over and I had a warrant in</v>

1833
01:26:49.611 --> 01:26:50.444
<v Speaker 8>Colorado.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I got,</v>

1834
01:26:50.480 --> 01:26:52.180
<v Speaker 8>we got the rest of them Colorado for</v>
<v Speaker 8>shoplifting.</v>

1835
01:26:52.490 --> 01:26:55.160
<v Speaker 8>No Way.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I just kept eating my fucking meal</v>

1836
01:26:57.360 --> 01:26:59.800
<v Speaker 8>but at least he didn't get arrested</v>
<v Speaker 8>cause it's fucking time proof.</v>

1837
01:26:59.810 --> 01:27:02.770
<v Speaker 8>I did my fucking thing.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That is so ridiculous.</v>

1838
01:27:02.771 --> 01:27:06.740
<v Speaker 8>You imagine getting arrested in boulder.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I think about the words you told me</v>

1839
01:27:06.741 --> 01:27:09.650
<v Speaker 8>about boulder once you go.</v>

<v Speaker 8>They let you out without a life.</v>

01:31:15.451 --> 01:31:17.670
<v Speaker 8>limits of boulder.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

1934
01:31:21.270 --> 01:31:24.690
<v Speaker 8>because the football players and 85</v>
<v Speaker 8>those football players that were really</v>

1935
01:31:24.691 --> 01:31:27.570
<v Speaker 8>powerful that that those teams that won</v>
<v Speaker 8>the national championship,</v>

1936
01:31:27.571 --> 01:31:29.320
<v Speaker 8>there was always beef with them in</v>
<v Speaker 8>boulder.</v>

1937
01:31:29.340 --> 01:31:33.510
<v Speaker 8>The cops always had beef with them.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So there was one,</v>

1938
01:31:33.600 --> 01:31:36.060
<v Speaker 8>there was a couple of incidents.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It was Kuneva Magee.</v>

1939
01:31:36.360 --> 01:31:38.730
<v Speaker 8>He just smacked them motherfuckers.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I ball out of his head.</v>

1940
01:31:39.840 --> 01:31:41.240
<v Speaker 8>I told those,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you think I'm kidding,</v>

1941
01:31:41.310 --> 01:31:45.420
<v Speaker 8>I'm not cracking jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 8>He broke his eye socket six foot five to</v>

1942
01:31:45.421 --> 01:31:50.421
<v Speaker 8>45 well that smack with a smack Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Oh Stockton slap I ball went out of his</v>

1943

<v Speaker 8>fucking head weight made money,</v>
<v Speaker 8>had a ring on.</v>

1944
01:31:53.280 --> 01:31:57.300
<v Speaker 8>And then another lady called Jj Flanigan</v>
<v Speaker 8>a nigger and he punched her in the face.</v>

1945
01:31:58.080 --> 01:32:00.040
<v Speaker 8>So they dropped the,</v>
<v Speaker 8>because she</v>

1946
01:32:00.040 --> 01:32:02.020
<v Speaker 5>said a racial slur.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's hilarious.</v>

1947
01:32:02.050 --> 01:32:06.640
<v Speaker 5>So when a woman can call a guy in and</v>
<v Speaker 5>just get punched in the face,</v>

<v Speaker 5>so they call it the Jj Flannigan rule.</v>

1949
01:32:09.771 --> 01:32:13.360
<v Speaker 5>So like God is so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When I got arrested for that racial</v>

1950
01:32:13.361 --> 01:32:14.021
<v Speaker 5>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I told him,</v>

1951
01:32:14.021 --> 01:32:16.270
<v Speaker 5>he called me a Spec what she did in</v>
<v Speaker 5>front of my daughter.</v>

1952
01:32:18.120 --> 01:32:20.430
<v Speaker 5>So I smacked him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So wait a minute.</v>

1953
01:32:20.431 --> 01:32:24.670
<v Speaker 5>Did the football player smacker or</v>
<v Speaker 5>puncher thank you smack that Jj</v>

1954
01:32:24.670 --> 01:32:26.660
<v Speaker 5>Flanagan.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a street corner in the bolt and</v>

1955
01:32:26.661 --> 01:32:30.770
<v Speaker 5>Pearl Street mall is something that's</v>
<v Speaker 5>how strong that word is just smack.</v>

1956
01:32:30.800 --> 01:32:32.550
<v Speaker 5>And Zoe is the only word that it has a</v>
<v Speaker 5>letter.</v>

1957
01:32:32.610 --> 01:32:35.700
<v Speaker 5>Like you could kind of say the f word,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but most people say fuck.</v>

1958
01:32:35.730 --> 01:32:40.080
<v Speaker 5>But he was still,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is still 88 this is 88 this is</v>

1959
01:32:40.081 --> 01:32:42.540
<v Speaker 5>named d.</v>
<v Speaker 5>These are the times when they would come</v>

1960
01:32:42.541 --> 01:32:44.340
<v Speaker 5>down and see you football,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

1961
01:32:44.341 --> 01:32:46.620
<v Speaker 5>But they had a lot of shit going on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like there's a document,</v>

1962
01:32:46.650 --> 01:32:48.630
<v Speaker 5>there's a 30 for 30 Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

1963
01:32:48.660 --> 01:32:50.100
<v Speaker 5>great.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let me ask you this,</v>

1964
01:32:50.101 --> 01:32:52.500
<v Speaker 5>why do you think boulder has always been</v>
<v Speaker 5>so liberal?</v>

1965
01:32:54.070 --> 01:32:56.410
<v Speaker 5>Because they want to be,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they had that right to be,</v>

1966
01:32:56.470 --> 01:33:01.470
<v Speaker 5>these are people that want to live,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know the boulder now I'm others will</v>

1967
01:33:01.990 --> 01:33:03.310
<v Speaker 5>go set him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So Santa Monica,</v>

1968
01:33:03.480 --> 01:33:06.220
<v Speaker 5>it's the same fucking people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What do you mean it's the same people?</v>

1969
01:33:06.250 --> 01:33:10.420
<v Speaker 5>That was not the bold and when I got</v>
<v Speaker 5>there in 1980 not even close.</v>

1970
01:33:10.480 --> 01:33:13.660
<v Speaker 5>What's the difference?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

1971
01:33:13.661 --> 01:33:15.400
<v Speaker 5>What the gentiles,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1972
01:33:15.401 --> 01:33:18.010
<v Speaker 5>starbucks,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's not what blogging was.</v>

1973
01:33:18.011 --> 01:33:22.510
<v Speaker 5>Stalls to be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Boulder was totally brought up to be</v>

1974
01:33:22.511 --> 01:33:26.410
<v Speaker 5>anti very much establishment.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Very uh,</v>

1975
01:33:26.710 --> 01:33:28.510
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people who have soap companies,</v>

1976
01:33:29.370 --> 01:33:31.390
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>People who have shirts with designs of</v>

1977
01:33:31.391 --> 01:33:33.370
<v Speaker 5>the grateful dead.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But that's what it is.</v>

1978
01:33:33.610 --> 01:33:35.410
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>If that's what it is,</v>

1979
01:33:35.411 --> 01:33:38.650
<v Speaker 5>let that be that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well there's a bunch of people in</v>

1980
01:33:38.651 --> 01:33:41.650
<v Speaker 5>Boulder,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it'll just go democrat no matter what,</v>

1981
01:33:42.070 --> 01:33:45.040
<v Speaker 5>which means they just vote Democrat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh No,</v>

1982
01:33:45.070 --> 01:33:46.390
<v Speaker 5>they don't vote Republican ever.</v>

1983
01:33:46.390 --> 01:33:47.710
<v Speaker 5>So like when I was there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was,</v>

1984
01:33:47.760 --> 01:33:52.760
<v Speaker 5>it was during the Obama election after</v>
<v Speaker 5>he got elected for the first term is</v>

1985
01:33:52.790 --> 01:33:54.180
<v Speaker 5>when I was there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

1986
01:33:54.640 --> 01:33:58.720
<v Speaker 5>I was like this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's so weird that there's so many</v>

1987
01:33:58.721 --> 01:34:03.220
<v Speaker 5>different people that have the same</v>
<v Speaker 5>thing on their front lawn.</v>

1988
01:34:03.430 --> 01:34:04.510
<v Speaker 5>It's Obama,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Obama,</v>

1989
01:34:04.511 --> 01:34:08.830
<v Speaker 5>Obama like everywhere you look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he didn't see any Republican candidates</v>

1990
01:34:08.920 --> 01:34:10.780
<v Speaker 5>on anybody's launch.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you just didn't see that.</v>

1991
01:34:10.810 --> 01:34:13.480
<v Speaker 5>What is the rest of Colorado like?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Way Republican,</v>

1992
01:34:13.660 --> 01:34:16.690
<v Speaker 5>way more republican rest of Colorado is</v>
<v Speaker 5>like cowboys and shit.</v>

1993
01:34:17.050 --> 01:34:18.580
<v Speaker 5>Denver's kind of a mixture.</v>
<v Speaker 5>DENVER,</v>

1994
01:34:18.581 --> 01:34:20.880
<v Speaker 5>you get a little bit of everything cause</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's sort of like Austin,</v>

1995
01:34:20.890 --> 01:34:22.690
<v Speaker 5>Texas,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like that sort of like no,</v>

1996
01:34:22.691 --> 01:34:25.450
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no because Austin is more like cowboy</v>

1997
01:34:25.451 --> 01:34:27.610
<v Speaker 5>funky.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Austin's different.</v>

1998
01:34:27.640 --> 01:34:32.410
<v Speaker 5>Austin is like a lot of bad ass music</v>
<v Speaker 5>comes from Austin fucking Gary Clark Jr</v>

1999
01:34:32.411 --> 01:34:36.040
<v Speaker 5>comes from Austin.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But the state of mine of Wash of Boulder</v>

2000
01:34:36.070 --> 01:34:40.300
<v Speaker 5>and Austin were pretty much similar</v>
<v Speaker 5>representing that the states.</v>

2001
01:34:40.450 --> 01:34:43.510
<v Speaker 5>But you can't compare them because most</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's only a hundred thousand people.</v>

2002
01:34:43.690 --> 01:34:46.030
<v Speaker 5>It's tiny ass place.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Austin's a million.</v>

2003
01:34:46.090 --> 01:34:49.330
<v Speaker 5>What's the population of of bold?</v>
<v Speaker 5>100,000 still.</v>

2004
01:34:49.360 --> 01:34:52.690
<v Speaker 5>It's tiny bates camp build.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They don't let you build.</v>

2005
01:34:52.760 --> 01:34:55.090
<v Speaker 5>They got that place locked down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well that's what I'm saying.</v>

2006
01:34:55.120 --> 01:34:58.220
<v Speaker 5>They always buy up open space.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Boulder always</v>

2007
01:34:58.220 --> 01:35:00.110
<v Speaker 1>wanted to be different than everybody</v>
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>

2008
01:35:00.300 --> 01:35:01.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I first went to boulder,</v>

2009
01:35:01.910 --> 01:35:06.380
<v Speaker 1>I first peaked at Boulder July of 83 and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

2010

<v Speaker 1>I'll never come to this fucking place</v>
<v Speaker 1>too boring.</v>

2011

<v Speaker 1>Boston's a totally different animal.</v>

2017
01:35:33.380 --> 01:35:37.640
<v Speaker 1>Austin as much more like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just meant in the way like Texas is</v>

2021
01:35:41.241 --> 01:35:44.750
<v Speaker 1>Austin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Austin's not entirely liberal.</v>

2022
01:35:44.990 --> 01:35:46.940
<v Speaker 1>Austin's a mixture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird mixture.</v>

2023

01:38:08.170 --> 01:38:11.700
<v Speaker 1>got a giant elk herd walking through the</v>
<v Speaker 1>middle of the street and a buddy of mine</v>

2075
01:38:11.701 --> 01:38:14.510
<v Speaker 1>moved there and he was living in Vegas</v>
<v Speaker 1>before and he,</v>

<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was asking him about Colorado.</v>

2078
01:38:17.560 --> 01:38:18.930
<v Speaker 1>And he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he went there once,</v>

2079
01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:20.610
<v Speaker 1>bought a house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>immediately moved.</v>

2080
01:38:21.120 --> 01:38:23.520
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he texted me that these elk,</v>

2081
01:38:23.580 --> 01:38:26.220
<v Speaker 1>they get in the middle of the street and</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who was from out of town</v>

2082
01:38:26.280 --> 01:38:30.810
<v Speaker 1>apparently was like beep in and trying</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get the elk out of the road and like</v>

2083
01:38:30.811 --> 01:38:35.811
<v Speaker 1>revving his engine and cause he was in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>rush and some old cowboy got out of his</v>

2084
01:38:35.851 --> 01:38:38.220
<v Speaker 1>truck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>walked up to dude's car window,</v>

2085
01:38:38.221 --> 01:38:41.580
<v Speaker 1>punched him through the car window and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then got back in his truck,</v>

2086
01:38:43.750 --> 01:38:46.380
<v Speaker 1>get sick because the guy was harassing</v>
<v Speaker 1>the helicopter.</v>

2087
01:38:46.680 --> 01:38:47.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's no joke,</v>

2088
01:38:47.551 --> 01:38:49.380
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's really what happens in evergreen.</v>

2089
01:38:49.410 --> 01:38:53.130
<v Speaker 1>This is a herd of elk walking down the</v>
<v Speaker 1>middle of the street and you can't do a</v>

2090
01:38:53.131 --> 01:38:56.490
<v Speaker 1>God damn thing about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And because the people in the town</v>

2091
01:38:56.520 --> 01:38:59.400
<v Speaker 1>itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they don't really hunt them when</v>

2092
01:38:59.401 --> 01:39:00.290
<v Speaker 1>they do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>

2093
01:39:00.291 --> 01:39:03.810
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the elk feel super calm about walking on</v>

2094
01:39:03.811 --> 01:39:07.230
<v Speaker 1>the highway in front of everybody</v>
<v Speaker 1>because if they were in the woods with</v>

2095
01:39:07.231 --> 01:39:09.420
<v Speaker 1>you like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would fucking bolt of,</v>

2096
01:39:09.421 --> 01:39:11.370
<v Speaker 1>they saw a person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they smelled you,</v>

2097
01:39:11.371 --> 01:39:13.830
<v Speaker 1>they would bolt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But meanwhile these things have chosen</v>

2098
01:39:13.831 --> 01:39:18.420
<v Speaker 1>to go like by the road.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting too because they,</v>

2099
01:39:18.450 --> 01:39:22.200
<v Speaker 1>they don't recognize people as predators</v>
<v Speaker 1>in those situations.</v>

2100
01:39:22.230 --> 01:39:24.780
<v Speaker 1>It's like people around urban areas</v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't predators,</v>

2101
01:39:24.870 --> 01:39:26.610
<v Speaker 1>but people in the mountains are</v>
<v Speaker 1>predators.</v>

2102
01:39:26.790 --> 01:39:30.350
<v Speaker 1>It's real weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for generations that like [inaudible]</v>

2103
01:39:30.490 --> 01:39:32.610
<v Speaker 1>group of Alex has just been walking down</v>
<v Speaker 1>the street.</v>

2104
01:39:32.880 --> 01:39:33.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unbelievable.</v>

2105
01:39:33.750 --> 01:39:35.400
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not only that,</v>

2106
01:39:35.401 --> 01:39:37.230
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's the case everywhere.</v>

2107
01:39:37.440 --> 01:39:39.010
<v Speaker 1>Like in yellowstone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a,</v>

2108
01:39:39.050 --> 01:39:41.490
<v Speaker 1>a video that someone sent me today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't,</v>

2109
01:39:42.150 --> 01:39:43.830
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I retweeted it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2110
01:39:43.860 --> 01:39:45.190
<v Speaker 1>someone send me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't watch him,</v>

2111
01:39:45.200 --> 01:39:47.850
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't getting self service,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a video that someone sent me</v>

2112
01:39:47.851 --> 01:39:50.190
<v Speaker 1>today about some woman and got too close</v>
<v Speaker 1>to an elk in yellowstone.</v>

2113
01:39:50.191 --> 01:39:52.920
<v Speaker 1>I guess it was real recently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but mo for the most part,</v>

2114
01:39:52.921 --> 01:39:55.950
<v Speaker 1>they don't worry about people they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>wearing about wolves and grizzly bears</v>

2115
01:39:55.951 --> 01:39:57.790
<v Speaker 1>and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they see a person they go,</v>

2116
01:39:58.230 --> 01:40:01.050
<v Speaker 1>cause no one's hunted in yellowstone for</v>
<v Speaker 1>over a hundred years.</v>

2117
01:40:01.500 --> 01:40:03.390
<v Speaker 1>So elk see people there and they were</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2118
01:40:03.391 --> 01:40:04.470
<v Speaker 1>what's up dude?</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2121
01:40:07.710 --> 01:40:09.960

<v Speaker 1>He just kicked him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That guy has dog shit Jujitsu.</v>

2158
01:41:33.551 --> 01:41:35.710
<v Speaker 1>First of all should be spinning for one</v>
<v Speaker 1>of those rear legs.</v>

2159
01:41:36.130 --> 01:41:38.670
<v Speaker 1>You try to get them in a heel hook on</v>
<v Speaker 1>that real.</v>

2160
01:41:38.800 --> 01:41:39.720
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2161
01:41:39.730 --> 01:41:42.280
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>comorbid a deer's lag and snapped it in</v>

2162
01:41:42.281 --> 01:41:45.170
<v Speaker 1>half after it was already dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was trying to,</v>

2163
01:41:45.460 --> 01:41:46.930
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if this would work.</v>

2164
01:41:47.050 --> 01:41:52.050
<v Speaker 1>A deer snapped its leg when Callan and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>and went hunting in Montana.</v>

2165
01:41:52.630 --> 01:41:54.790
<v Speaker 1>So I feel real confident that I could</v>
<v Speaker 1>heal.</v>

2166
01:41:54.791 --> 01:41:56.440
<v Speaker 1>Hook a deer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck it up.</v>

2167
01:41:56.500 --> 01:42:00.060
<v Speaker 1>Have you lost your fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>deal?</v>

2168
01:42:00.150 --> 01:42:01.750
<v Speaker 1>I take us back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take us back.</v>

2169
01:42:02.890 --> 01:42:06.350
<v Speaker 1>Take that fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're in the hospital with a ball.</v>

2170
01:42:09.280 --> 01:42:10.240
<v Speaker 1>By the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My fault.</v>

2171
01:42:11.530 --> 01:42:13.320
<v Speaker 1>Probably just recovering right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2172
01:42:13.330 --> 01:42:15.970
<v Speaker 1>He's in the hall in the hospital today</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he got his,</v>

2173
01:42:16.480 --> 01:42:19.120
<v Speaker 1>his discs replaced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How long does that take now?</v>

2174
01:42:19.640 --> 01:42:22.210
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think the operation is,</v>

2175
01:42:22.211 --> 01:42:24.510
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just a few hours and I'm,</v>

2176
01:42:24.520 --> 01:42:28.600
<v Speaker 1>the recovery time is a ridiculously low.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think a,</v>

2177
01:42:28.601 --> 01:42:30.670
<v Speaker 1>in six weeks he's allowed to start</v>
<v Speaker 1>lifting weights.</v>

2178
01:42:31.330 --> 01:42:34.570
<v Speaker 1>So six weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his body has to heal up.</v>

2179
01:42:34.930 --> 01:42:37.900
<v Speaker 1>So I'm talking out of school cause I</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know the exact procedure,</v>

2180
01:42:37.901 --> 01:42:42.190
<v Speaker 1>but I know this is what he told me is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they're replacing a disk with a</v>

2181
01:42:42.191 --> 01:42:46.340
<v Speaker 1>titanium disk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have some sort of a new technology</v>

2182
01:42:46.341 --> 01:42:49.240
<v Speaker 1>in disc replacement where they used to</v>
<v Speaker 1>take the disc out and then they would</v>

2183
01:42:49.241 --> 01:42:52.030
<v Speaker 1>fuse it together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right now instead they'll put an</v>

2184
01:42:52.031 --> 01:42:56.770
<v Speaker 1>artificial disc and it's supposed to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>just as good as um,</v>

2185
01:42:56.800 --> 01:42:58.480
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a real desk.</v>

2186
01:42:58.870 --> 01:43:01.690
<v Speaker 1>And the difference being that like when</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would fuse those discs,</v>

2187
01:43:01.900 --> 01:43:04.780
<v Speaker 1>it would limit your mobility pretty</v>
<v Speaker 1>drastically because you don't have any</v>

2188
01:43:04.781 --> 01:43:09.781
<v Speaker 1>articulation in between the two joints a</v>
<v Speaker 1>now that they have this artificial disk</v>

2189
01:43:09.940 --> 01:43:12.550
<v Speaker 1>that aren't dead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>artificial disc actually moves around</v>

2190
01:43:12.820 --> 01:43:17.710
<v Speaker 1>and it allows your spine to be flexible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm one of the guys from school,</v>

2191
01:43:17.711 --> 01:43:21.460
<v Speaker 1>Victor got it done and apparently he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>never been better and it feels great.</v>

2192
01:43:21.461 --> 01:43:23.890
<v Speaker 1>No pain at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was bothering him for a long time</v>

2193
01:43:24.310 --> 01:43:27.250
<v Speaker 1>and Eddie's been bothering his for</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost as long as I've known him cause</v>

2194
01:43:27.251 --> 01:43:29.490
<v Speaker 1>he does so much stuff from his back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2195
01:43:29.590 --> 01:43:33.610
<v Speaker 1>it's all guard work and it's getting</v>
<v Speaker 1>stacked all the time and compressed all</v>

2196
01:43:33.611 --> 01:43:36.550
<v Speaker 1>the time and not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2197
01:43:36.580 --> 01:43:40.060
<v Speaker 1>not the most diligent about stretching</v>
<v Speaker 1>the back out early in his career.</v>

2198
01:43:40.180 --> 01:43:43.270
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just he take your stretching before and</v>

2199
01:43:43.271 --> 01:43:46.090
<v Speaker 1>after you who you definitely should warm</v>
<v Speaker 1>up before.</v>

2200
01:43:46.580 --> 01:43:49.240
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the big thing is mobility,</v>

2201
01:43:49.300 --> 01:43:51.100
<v Speaker 1>mobility,</v>
<v Speaker 1>training meaning,</v>

2202
01:43:51.140 --> 01:43:54.440
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing things like bending down,</v>

2203
01:43:54.470 --> 01:43:59.090
<v Speaker 1>grabbing the back of your heel with your</v>
<v Speaker 1>four fingers on both sides and trying to</v>

2204
01:43:59.091 --> 01:44:03.140
<v Speaker 1>put your pinkies together and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>extending your legs and you're popping</v>

2205
01:44:03.141 --> 01:44:05.750
<v Speaker 1>your back and stretching your back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For me,</v>

2206
01:44:05.751 --> 01:44:08.550
<v Speaker 1>that's big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hanging by your ankles as big and he</v>

2207
01:44:08.551 --> 01:44:11.360
<v Speaker 1>sort of decompression anything that</v>
<v Speaker 1>alleviates pressure.</v>

2208
01:44:11.390 --> 01:44:14.240
<v Speaker 1>I have one that I put on my neck and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like I'm hanging myself and go</v>

2209
01:44:14.241 --> 01:44:14.721
<v Speaker 1>click,</v>
<v Speaker 1>click,</v>

2210
01:44:14.721 --> 01:44:15.171
<v Speaker 1>click,</v>
<v Speaker 1>click,</v>

2211
01:44:15.171 --> 01:44:15.681
<v Speaker 1>click,</v>
<v Speaker 1>click,</v>

2212
01:44:15.681 --> 01:44:18.290
<v Speaker 1>click.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like literally hanging a good,</v>

2213
01:44:18.291 --> 01:44:20.030
<v Speaker 1>good percentage of my weight from my</v>
<v Speaker 1>neck.</v>

2214
01:44:20.180 --> 01:44:22.730
<v Speaker 1>Then I have a bunch of them in the back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have different,</v>

2215
01:44:22.731 --> 01:44:24.680
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>decompression devices in the back.</v>

2216
01:44:25.010 --> 01:44:27.830
<v Speaker 1>I've got the reverse hyper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which strengthens your back.</v>

2217
01:44:27.831 --> 01:44:32.000
<v Speaker 1>And also it's like an active,</v>
<v Speaker 1>moot moving decompression of the bag</v>

2218
01:44:32.270 --> 01:44:33.180
<v Speaker 1>that's created by that.</v>

2219
01:44:33.180 --> 01:44:35.150
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Louie Simmons guy that from a west side,</v>

2220
01:44:35.151 --> 01:44:37.250
<v Speaker 1>barbell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just genius guy.</v>

2221
01:44:37.880 --> 01:44:41.360
<v Speaker 1>He had a back injury too and you needed</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get it fixed and they were going to,</v>

2222
01:44:41.390 --> 01:44:42.850
<v Speaker 1>they wanted to cut him and he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

2223
01:44:42.851 --> 01:44:46.350
<v Speaker 1>I think I can figure this out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's gotta be an exercise.</v>

2224
01:44:46.351 --> 01:44:49.070
<v Speaker 1>It strengthens this instead of surgery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's what he came up with.</v>

2225
01:44:49.490 --> 01:44:51.290
<v Speaker 1>But see in Eddie's position,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't even know if that would have</v>

2226
01:44:51.291 --> 01:44:54.950
<v Speaker 1>helped because Eddie's was so far gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't have any disc left.</v>

2227
01:44:54.980 --> 01:44:56.210
<v Speaker 1>There was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing there.</v>

2228
01:44:56.270 --> 01:44:57.260
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll burrow those.</v>

2229
01:44:57.261 --> 01:45:01.360
<v Speaker 1>They do look 12 o'clock class then at</v>
<v Speaker 1>one 15 it's a mobility class for half</v>

2230
01:45:01.360 --> 01:45:03.140
<v Speaker 1>hour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said that Kettle Jitsu guy.</v>

2231
01:45:03.170 --> 01:45:04.760
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but isn't there a guide?</v>

2232
01:45:04.790 --> 01:45:05.870
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

2233
01:45:05.900 --> 01:45:07.860
<v Speaker 1>but he's got tip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tick,</v>

2234
01:45:07.861 --> 01:45:09.230

<v Speaker 1>tick,</v>

2235
01:45:09.231 --> 01:45:10.460
<v Speaker 1>fit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got tick fit.</v>

2236
01:45:10.520 --> 01:45:11.330
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>

2237
01:45:11.330 --> 01:45:13.400
<v Speaker 1>Tick fit?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that new training with the bats?</v>

2238
01:45:14.640 --> 01:45:17.210
<v Speaker 1>How'd he say tick?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you spell it?</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2248
01:45:38.150 --> 01:45:40.100

<v Speaker 1>You're stretching your rob,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it's no,</v>

2262
01:46:12.680 --> 01:46:13.540
<v Speaker 1>no big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2263
01:46:13.560 --> 01:46:15.230
<v Speaker 1>you break a sweat on some of them,</v>

<v Speaker 1>and do push up.</v>

2265
01:46:19.070 --> 01:46:21.230
<v Speaker 1>We know it's problem with Jujitsu is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's fun.</v>

2266
01:46:21.680 --> 01:46:23.510
<v Speaker 1>And when it's fun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going in there and getting</v>

2267
01:46:23.511 --> 01:46:26.030
<v Speaker 1>smashed all the time and the overall</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

2268
01:46:26.031 --> 01:46:29.380
<v Speaker 1>you don't give yourself a lot of time to</v>
<v Speaker 1>recover from those rolling sessions and</v>

2269
01:46:29.381 --> 01:46:32.840
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of little micro injuries</v>

<v Speaker 5>He doesn't really hate Mondays.</v>

2295
01:47:45.061 --> 01:47:48.090
<v Speaker 5>Wednesdays and Fridays are hard.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wednesdays,</v>

01:47:48.180 --> 01:47:50.700
<v Speaker 5>Sundays I go cause the guy is just so</v>
<v Speaker 5>great.</v>

2297
01:47:50.701 --> 01:47:54.060
<v Speaker 5>Technically I always learn one little</v>
<v Speaker 5>stupid thing,</v>

2298
01:47:54.300 --> 01:47:56.340
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just one little stupid thing.</v>

2299
01:47:56.820 --> 01:47:59.030
<v Speaker 5>Your role like two or three times in</v>
<v Speaker 5>your out of that.</v>

2300
01:47:59.260 --> 01:48:01.980
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I always tried to take,</v>

2301
01:48:02.030 --> 01:48:03.450
<v Speaker 5>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if I want to go that day,</v>

2302
01:48:03.480 --> 01:48:08.040
<v Speaker 5>even if I feel okay and I'm not sore,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll take the day off because I don't</v>

2303
01:48:08.041 --> 01:48:09.750
<v Speaker 5>want to go every day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to do that.</v>

2304
01:48:09.900 --> 01:48:12.630
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll do a light kettlebell workout or</v>

2305
01:48:12.631 --> 01:48:13.980
<v Speaker 5>something.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But then there's other people that think</v>

2306
01:48:13.981 --> 01:48:16.440
<v Speaker 5>you just keep doing it and eventually</v>
<v Speaker 5>body hardens up.</v>

2307
01:48:17.160 --> 01:48:18.090
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

2308
01:48:18.230 --> 01:48:19.110

<v Speaker 5>it depends.</v>

2310
01:48:20.011 --> 01:48:21.390
<v Speaker 5>I guess it depends on how you approach</v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

2311
01:48:21.810 --> 01:48:25.600
<v Speaker 5>I know bordain does it every day.</v>

<v Speaker 5>We had our burden on him.</v>

2327
01:49:03.061 --> 01:49:05.100
<v Speaker 5>I'm about,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Britta was saying that the one place in</v>

2328
01:49:05.101 --> 01:49:09.030
<v Speaker 5>Brazil that you got to train 10 hours,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then you've got to walk a mile.</v>

2329
01:49:09.060 --> 01:49:11.700
<v Speaker 5>Then you've got to go across and one of</v>
<v Speaker 5>these things,</v>

2330
01:49:11.701 --> 01:49:13.530
<v Speaker 5>there's some days somebody would steal</v>
<v Speaker 5>the paddle.</v>

2331
01:49:15.150 --> 01:49:19.490
<v Speaker 5>Can you imagine Jesus?</v>
<v Speaker 5>10 hours a fucking fucking around our</v>

2332
01:49:19.650 --> 01:49:22.740
<v Speaker 5>mile walk and now some of these steals</v>
<v Speaker 5>the fucking battle.</v>

2333
01:49:22.741 --> 01:49:25.560
<v Speaker 5>I can't even battled through my fucking</v>
<v Speaker 5>house and there was shit in the water</v>

2334
01:49:25.590 --> 01:49:27.930
<v Speaker 5>and there was shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No water cause that the house,</v>

2335
01:49:28.230 --> 01:49:30.630
<v Speaker 5>the sewage would go into the water.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh Jesus.</v>

2336
01:49:30.650 --> 01:49:30.861
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

2338
01:49:31.021 --> 01:49:32.550
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then you wonder why they got Zika</v>

2339
01:49:32.551 --> 01:49:34.470
<v Speaker 5>and everybody's head's getting big in</v>
<v Speaker 5>Brazil and shit.</v>

2340
01:49:34.471 --> 01:49:36.270
<v Speaker 5>It was small.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what I'm now how's,</v>

2341
01:49:36.271 --> 01:49:38.450
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that's what they gave Jose Aldo</v>

2342
01:49:38.490 --> 01:49:40.380
<v Speaker 5>is to fight against mcgregor,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Zika virus.</v>

2343
01:49:41.380 --> 01:49:45.930
<v Speaker 5>They're all fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They had them crying after the show that</v>

2344
01:49:46.560 --> 01:49:47.770
<v Speaker 5>had a camera in the room.</v>

2345
01:49:48.070 --> 01:49:49.480
<v Speaker 4>I'm telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dana,</v>

2346
01:49:49.481 --> 01:49:51.710
<v Speaker 4>find a way to give them the Zika virus</v>
<v Speaker 4>is shit.</v>

2347
01:49:52.630 --> 01:49:55.930
<v Speaker 4>Imagine how bad the population would be</v>
<v Speaker 4>if there was no viruses.</v>

2348
01:49:56.350 --> 01:49:59.290
<v Speaker 4>If there was no diseases,</v>
<v Speaker 4>diseases didn't kill anybody.</v>

2349
01:49:59.380 --> 01:50:00.580
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how many people are killed?</v>

2350
01:50:00.640 --> 01:50:03.070
<v Speaker 4>Let's just take a guess.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How many people are killed every year by</v>

2351
01:50:03.071 --> 01:50:03.904
<v Speaker 4>disease?</v>

2352
01:50:05.120 --> 01:50:07.460
<v Speaker 4>Let's guess 2 million,</v>
<v Speaker 4>3 million.</v>

2353
01:50:07.880 --> 01:50:09.500
<v Speaker 4>How many people you think probably</v>
<v Speaker 4>around there,</v>

2354
01:50:09.501 --> 01:50:11.520
<v Speaker 4>but it's not in America.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's in like,</v>

2355
01:50:11.960 --> 01:50:13.190
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did she get that picture?</v>

2356
01:50:13.191 --> 01:50:15.770
<v Speaker 4>By the way of that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that a ladder and China,</v>

2357
01:50:17.060 --> 01:50:19.670
<v Speaker 4>China kids were climbing at places like</v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

2358
01:50:19.820 --> 01:50:24.170
<v Speaker 4>Like it's like a 2000 foot bamboo ladder</v>
<v Speaker 4>that like six year olds are climbing up.</v>

2359
01:50:24.380 --> 01:50:26.570
<v Speaker 4>Why are they doing that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the only way to get to their town.</v>

2360
01:50:27.050 --> 01:50:28.190
<v Speaker 4>So I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

2361
01:50:28.191 --> 01:50:31.010
<v Speaker 4>Have you seen that Jamie?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jesus Christ.</v>

<v Speaker 4>It might be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look at this.</v>

2364
01:50:35.030 --> 01:50:38.930
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Children in China would climb 2,500 foot</v>

2365
01:50:38.931 --> 01:50:41.270
<v Speaker 4>cliff to get to school,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe given stairs.</v>

01:51:35.211 --> 01:51:36.590
<v Speaker 4>That has been Nana's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So yeah,</v>

2384
01:51:36.591 --> 01:51:40.190
<v Speaker 4>I think it's places like this where</v>
<v Speaker 4>people are dying of viruses cause you</v>

2385
01:51:40.191 --> 01:51:41.330
<v Speaker 4>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you never really hear about it in</v>

2386
01:51:41.331 --> 01:51:44.330
<v Speaker 4>America that often.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well people definitely die of the flu</v>

2387
01:51:44.331 --> 01:51:46.400
<v Speaker 4>here in America.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's still happening.</v>

2388
01:51:46.640 --> 01:51:48.800
<v Speaker 4>I bet thousands of people die every year</v>
<v Speaker 4>from the flu.</v>

2389
01:51:49.430 --> 01:51:53.480
<v Speaker 4>But as far as how many people die from</v>
<v Speaker 4>diseases worldwide?</v>

2390
01:51:53.540 --> 01:51:57.560
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to say every year.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to say 20 million.</v>

2391
01:51:58.640 --> 01:51:59.750
<v Speaker 4>How many?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How many people?</v>

2392
01:52:00.440 --> 01:52:02.860
<v Speaker 4>It depends on like what kind of disease</v>
<v Speaker 4>cause there's lots of disease.</v>

2393
01:52:02.870 --> 01:52:04.670
<v Speaker 4>Cardiovascular disease.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

2394
01:52:04.671 --> 01:52:06.020
<v Speaker 4>It was different.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that's like,</v>

2395
01:52:06.560 --> 01:52:08.210
<v Speaker 4>that's just like poor health.</v>

2396
01:52:08.480 --> 01:52:12.800
<v Speaker 4>It says 2012 an estimated 56 million</v>
<v Speaker 4>people died.</v>

2397
01:52:13.580 --> 01:52:17.270
<v Speaker 4>Just died in America.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The whole world?</v>

2398
01:52:17.330 --> 01:52:19.040
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

2399
01:52:19.730 --> 01:52:21.130
<v Speaker 4>56 million.</v>
<v Speaker 4>1 million in the hole.</v>

2400
01:52:21.160 --> 01:52:22.850
<v Speaker 4>It was America.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That'd be like in one year.</v>

2401
01:52:22.880 --> 01:52:26.690
<v Speaker 4>That'd be a sixth of the country.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That wouldn't happen just America but in</v>

2402
01:52:26.691 --> 01:52:29.590
<v Speaker 4>the whole world only 56 million people</v>
<v Speaker 4>at a 7 billion.</v>

2403
01:52:29.591 --> 01:52:32.490
<v Speaker 4>And the either estimation I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they can't count on it.</v>

2404
01:52:32.540 --> 01:52:34.130
<v Speaker 4>Would you have guessed that that would</v>
<v Speaker 4>be what it was?</v>

2405
01:52:35.170 --> 01:52:36.480
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

2406
01:52:36.560 --> 01:52:37.910
<v Speaker 4>I would have thought I'd been way</v>
<v Speaker 4>higher.</v>

2407
01:52:37.970 --> 01:52:40.530
<v Speaker 4>What would you think?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like pre or like how many people die in</v>

2408
01:52:40.531 --> 01:52:43.820
<v Speaker 4>the year?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Actually I think 56 million is a pretty</v>

2409
01:52:43.821 --> 01:52:44.990
<v Speaker 4>big number.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you really stop,</v>

2410
01:52:45.080 --> 01:52:47.330
<v Speaker 4>think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they're not counting anybody in</v>

2411
01:52:47.331 --> 01:52:49.940
<v Speaker 4>Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No good luck.</v>

2412
01:52:50.030 --> 01:52:54.110
<v Speaker 4>Certainly people in Canada that's twice</v>
<v Speaker 4>that at least twice I guess.</v>

2413
01:52:54.111 --> 01:52:54.720
<v Speaker 4>That makes sense.</v>

2414
01:52:54.720 --> 01:52:57.360
<v Speaker 5>When you say disease,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is HIV,</v>

2415
01:52:58.440 --> 01:53:02.030
<v Speaker 5>syphilis and Medina crabs,</v>
<v Speaker 5>flu,</v>

2416
01:53:03.110 --> 01:53:04.350
<v Speaker 5>Zika,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Zika.</v>

2417
01:53:04.351 --> 01:53:06.660
<v Speaker 5>I don't think Zeke is really killing</v>
<v Speaker 5>many people just fucks up.</v>

2418
01:53:06.661 --> 01:53:09.630
<v Speaker 5>Kids just really fucks women up when</v>
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

2419
01:53:09.690 --> 01:53:12.300
<v Speaker 5>when they get apparently you can get and</v>
<v Speaker 5>not even know you have it.</v>

2420
01:53:12.400 --> 01:53:14.970
<v Speaker 5>Get pregnant at fucks your kid up.</v>

2421
01:53:16.560 --> 01:53:21.560
<v Speaker 4>Non Communicable disease is responsible</v>
<v Speaker 4>for 38 million of those.</v>

2422
01:53:21.920 --> 01:53:24.980
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so that's like heart disease and</v>

2423
01:53:25.490 --> 01:53:28.490
<v Speaker 4>cardiovascular.</v>
<v Speaker 4>11.6 million.</v>

2424
01:53:28.940 --> 01:53:29.510
<v Speaker 4>But I want,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want,</v>

2425
01:53:29.510 --> 01:53:32.720
<v Speaker 4>what I'm interested in is like malaria</v>
<v Speaker 4>and shit like that.</v>

2426
01:53:32.810 --> 01:53:34.550
<v Speaker 4>HIV,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2427
01:53:34.580 --> 01:53:39.580
<v Speaker 4>decreased slightly from 1.7 deaths and 2</v>
<v Speaker 4>million to 1.5 million sold in 2000 or</v>

2428
01:53:40.881 --> 01:53:44.480
<v Speaker 4>200,000 less.</v>
<v Speaker 4>1.5 million people die every year from</v>

2429
01:53:44.481 --> 01:53:47.330
<v Speaker 4>HIV.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Diarrhea is no longer among the top five</v>

2430
01:53:47.331 --> 01:53:50.030
<v Speaker 4>leading causes of death.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Diarrhea and aid.</v>

2431
01:53:50.210 --> 01:53:54.910
<v Speaker 5>Neck and neck</v>
<v Speaker 5>people die from diarrhea.</v>

2432
01:53:55.110 --> 01:53:55.841
<v Speaker 5>Chorus.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2433
01:53:55.841 --> 01:53:59.200
<v Speaker 5>they get dehydrated.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But how bizarre is it that that aids</v>

2434
01:53:59.201 --> 01:54:04.201
<v Speaker 5>kills that many people?</v>
<v Speaker 5>HIV deaths decreased 1.7 million to 1.5</v>

2435
01:54:04.721 --> 01:54:08.350
<v Speaker 5>million in 2012.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's still crazy.</v>

2436
01:54:08.590 --> 01:54:13.590
<v Speaker 5>Like when was the last time you heard</v>
<v Speaker 5>about someone in America dying from HIV?</v>

2437
01:54:15.560 --> 01:54:19.850
<v Speaker 5>You don't hear about it very often.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They say complications and they usually</v>

2438
01:54:19.860 --> 01:54:24.680
<v Speaker 5>just something later.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It gets a deficiency is something that,</v>

<v Speaker 8>funny that people worry about that?</v>

2501
01:57:08.101 --> 01:57:11.430
<v Speaker 8>They're worried he'd like something more</v>
<v Speaker 8>than them when it comes to the money.</v>

2502
01:57:11.970 --> 01:57:13.320
<v Speaker 8>Where's the money coming?</v>
<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>

2503
01:57:13.321 --> 01:57:15.180
<v Speaker 8>man,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's one of the ugliest,</v>

2504
01:57:15.450 --> 01:57:17.790
<v Speaker 8>I just got a call from a school teacher</v>
<v Speaker 8>and he goes,</v>

2505
01:57:18.090 --> 01:57:20.790
<v Speaker 8>I'm sorry I haven't gotten back to you.</v>
<v Speaker 8>He goes,</v>

2506
01:57:20.791 --> 01:57:23.220
<v Speaker 8>I've just had the hardest to once in my</v>
<v Speaker 8>fucking life.</v>

2507
01:57:23.250 --> 01:57:26.220
<v Speaker 8>My mom died.</v>
<v Speaker 8>What a fucking nightmare.</v>

2508
01:57:27.120 --> 01:57:31.590
<v Speaker 8>What a fucking nightmare death is.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And then there were big because nobody</v>

2509
01:57:31.591 --> 01:57:34.080
<v Speaker 8>gives a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And also it's like prince.</v>

2510
01:57:34.740 --> 01:57:36.510
<v Speaker 8>Prince dies.</v>
<v Speaker 8>No will.</v>

2511
01:57:37.770 --> 01:57:41.430
<v Speaker 8>$2 billion.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Six motherfucking savages.</v>

2512
01:57:42.480 --> 01:57:43.790
<v Speaker 4>He had $2 billion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>

2513
01:57:43.800 --> 01:57:45.840
<v Speaker 4>He had 250 million.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fuck.</v>

2514
01:57:45.841 --> 01:57:48.180
<v Speaker 4>He really had no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well I've heard that a lot of things.</v>

2515
01:57:48.181 --> 01:57:51.990
<v Speaker 4>Talking about how,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how an investor involved in copyright.</v>

2516
01:57:51.991 --> 01:57:55.290
<v Speaker 4>He was with his own music,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is especially why I changed his</v>

2517
01:57:55.291 --> 01:57:58.710
<v Speaker 4>name and to think he would not think to</v>
<v Speaker 4>have a will.</v>

2518
01:57:58.711 --> 01:58:01.410
<v Speaker 4>It seems really strange.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some people who think it's bad luck.</v>

2519
01:58:02.690 --> 01:58:04.380
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Prince was crazy.</v>

2520
01:58:04.381 --> 01:58:06.210
<v Speaker 4>Just crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you think that that would be odd</v>

2521
01:58:06.211 --> 01:58:07.980
<v Speaker 4>for him to not have a will?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

2522
01:58:07.981 --> 01:58:09.300
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it would be that odd.</v>

2523
01:58:09.301 --> 01:58:14.270
<v Speaker 4>He was so odd anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 4>being that invested in your money cause</v>

2524
01:58:14.280 --> 01:58:16.080
<v Speaker 4>that's what he was worried about with</v>
<v Speaker 4>knowing all this thing.</v>

2525
01:58:16.140 --> 01:58:17.160
<v Speaker 4>That's the last,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

2526
01:58:17.190 --> 01:58:20.730
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it doesn't care valuable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe didn't want to be valuable when he</v>

2527
01:58:20.731 --> 01:58:23.730
<v Speaker 4>was dead to family members and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe he did want to like have that.</v>

2528
01:58:23.910 --> 01:58:25.440
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who cares what happens to my money when</v>

2529
01:58:25.441 --> 01:58:27.660
<v Speaker 4>I'm dead?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The problem is the government gets a big</v>

2530
01:58:27.661 --> 01:58:29.730
<v Speaker 4>chunk of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you don't have it written off,</v>

2531
01:58:30.030 --> 01:58:31.710
<v Speaker 4>if you don't have a given off to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2532
01:58:31.730 --> 01:58:32.870
<v Speaker 4>various family members,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2533
01:58:32.980 --> 01:58:36.660
<v Speaker 4>the government gets up fat piece,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but don't they still get a piece?</v>

2534
01:58:36.750 --> 01:58:38.280
<v Speaker 4>They definitely get a piece.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They get a piece.</v>

2535
01:58:38.460 --> 01:58:40.860
<v Speaker 4>Not only do they get a piece,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they get a piece from money that you've</v>

2536
01:58:40.861 --> 01:58:42.130
<v Speaker 4>already been taxed on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like say</v>

2537
01:58:42.130 --> 01:58:43.570
<v Speaker 1>of Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he makes $1 million,</v>

2538
01:58:43.571 --> 01:58:45.190
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Joey is $1 million in the bank and</v>

2539
01:58:45.191 --> 01:58:49.060
<v Speaker 1>he leaves it all to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joey didn't make $1 million to get $1</v>

2540
01:58:49.060 --> 01:58:50.800
<v Speaker 1>million.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had to make way more than a million</v>

2541
01:58:50.800 --> 01:58:52.690
<v Speaker 1>dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he probably had to make closer to two</v>

2542
01:58:53.080 --> 01:58:58.080
<v Speaker 1>because when you get over $250,000,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tax percentage is like 40 something</v>

2543
01:58:58.571 --> 01:59:01.900
<v Speaker 1>percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then sales tax and all the other</v>

2544
01:59:01.901 --> 01:59:03.670
<v Speaker 1>taxes that you have to take,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any consideration,</v>

2545
01:59:03.671 --> 01:59:06.160
<v Speaker 1>state tax,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all this different stuff,</v>

2546
01:59:06.161 --> 01:59:07.270
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Property tax,</v>

2547
01:59:07.370 --> 01:59:10.780
<v Speaker 1>I think about all the taxes you pay to</v>
<v Speaker 1>save up a million bucks get,</v>

2548
01:59:10.790 --> 01:59:13.360
<v Speaker 1>it's a lot of money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if he leaves out of that million</v>

2549
01:59:13.360 --> 01:59:14.860
<v Speaker 1>bucks to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't get the million dollars,</v>

2550
01:59:14.861 --> 01:59:17.200
<v Speaker 1>you have to be tax on that million</v>
<v Speaker 1>dollars.</v>

2551
01:59:17.440 --> 01:59:20.380
<v Speaker 1>So you have to be taxed on money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's already been taxed on.</v>

2552
01:59:20.710 --> 01:59:23.080
<v Speaker 1>It's not like he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless he gives you a gold coins.</v>

2553
01:59:23.320 --> 01:59:25.420
<v Speaker 1>But even if he gives you gold coins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you Oh,</v>

2554
01:59:25.421 --> 01:59:30.421
<v Speaker 1>the value of those gold coins in tax,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you owe a percentage in tax.</v>

2555
01:59:30.940 --> 01:59:35.940
<v Speaker 1>So let's say if I to sit rows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a safe and every day I put a gold</v>

2556
01:59:36.821 --> 01:59:38.710
<v Speaker 1>coin in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I put money in the bank.</v>

2557
01:59:38.711 --> 01:59:41.530
<v Speaker 1>You got a half a mil in the bank or they</v>
<v Speaker 1>with thousands thousand savings.</v>

2558
01:59:41.980 --> 01:59:45.070
<v Speaker 1>But I probably got like 2 million back</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing coins and nobody knows what I</v>

2559
01:59:45.090 --> 01:59:48.280
<v Speaker 1>leaving cause Joe Rogan to pay taxes on</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2560
01:59:48.290 --> 01:59:51.610
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would legit even if nobody would.</v>

2561
01:59:51.640 --> 01:59:52.830
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if otherwise it would,</v>

2562
01:59:52.831 --> 01:59:55.510
<v Speaker 1>it wouldn't be mine unless you'd written</v>
<v Speaker 1>it off to me.</v>

2563
01:59:55.750 --> 01:59:57.610
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So once you write it off to me,</v>

2564
01:59:57.611 --> 01:59:59.920
<v Speaker 1>then it becomes mine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if it becomes mine,</v>

2565
02:00:00.070 --> 02:00:01.630
<v Speaker 1>that's some money that someone just gave</v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

2566
02:00:01.660 --> 02:00:06.010
<v Speaker 1>I got to pay tax on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uncle Sam is just a robber just to like,</v>

2567
02:00:06.011 --> 02:00:06.910
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what'd you get a gift,</v>

2568
02:00:06.911 --> 02:00:08.590
<v Speaker 1>Joey?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get a gift from me.</v>

2569
02:00:08.710 --> 02:00:10.480
<v Speaker 1>That's nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's nice.</v>

2570
02:00:10.600 --> 02:00:13.390
<v Speaker 1>How come I didn't get a gift?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where's my fucking gift?</v>

2571
02:00:13.420 --> 02:00:15.630
<v Speaker 1>But what if I want my fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck?</v>

2572
02:00:17.790 --> 02:00:20.020
<v Speaker 1>What have Uncle Sam don't know about</v>
<v Speaker 1>that 2 million?</v>

2573
02:00:20.021 --> 02:00:20.860
<v Speaker 1>Would you rat?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2574
02:00:20.870 --> 02:00:22.840
<v Speaker 1>you have to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to figure out a way that you</v>

2575
02:00:22.841 --> 02:00:25.870
<v Speaker 1>have that 2 million.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See if someone gives it to you.</v>

2576
02:00:25.930 --> 02:00:28.390
<v Speaker 1>What does this gift tax.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2577
02:00:28.420 --> 02:00:31.660
<v Speaker 1>How's that work?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The following gifts are considered to be</v>

2578
02:00:31.661 --> 02:00:36.661
<v Speaker 1>taxable gifts when they exceed an annual</v>
<v Speaker 1>gift exclusion amount of $14,000 taxable</v>

2579
02:00:38.051 --> 02:00:43.051
<v Speaker 1>gifts count as part five point $3</v>
<v Speaker 1>million in 2014 you're allowed to give</v>

2580
02:00:43.121 --> 02:00:46.630
<v Speaker 1>away during your lifetime before you</v>
<v Speaker 1>must pay the gift tax.</v>

2581
02:00:46.690 --> 02:00:51.690
<v Speaker 1>Why hold the fuck on gifts subjects to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the d?</v>

2582
02:00:53.110 --> 02:00:55.330
<v Speaker 1>So if I give you something and it is</v>
<v Speaker 1>expensive,</v>

2583
02:00:55.480 --> 02:01:00.460
<v Speaker 1>you have to pay a gift tax.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's over a certain amount of money.</v>

2584
02:01:00.490 --> 02:01:02.390
<v Speaker 1>That's disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thousand Dollars.</v>

2585
02:01:02.740 --> 02:01:05.530
<v Speaker 1>That's disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really is.</v>

2586
02:01:05.980 --> 02:01:08.980
<v Speaker 1>It's really sad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just sad.</v>

2587
02:01:09.190 --> 02:01:12.850
<v Speaker 1>It's sad that we live in this fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>country that thinks it's okay to steal</v>

2588
02:01:12.851 --> 02:01:14.110
<v Speaker 1>money like that from people.</v>

2589
02:01:14.410 --> 02:01:17.770
<v Speaker 1>Like say if you don't have anything and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know you don't make a lot of money</v>

2590
02:01:17.771 --> 02:01:22.630
<v Speaker 1>and a guy gives you $20,000 you have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>give the government a piece of that</v>

2591
02:01:22.631 --> 02:01:26.920
<v Speaker 1>$20,000 fuck them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck them.</v>

2592
02:01:26.970 --> 02:01:29.830
<v Speaker 1>I mean fuck that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's bullshit.</v>

2593
02:01:29.920 --> 02:01:31.750
<v Speaker 1>What about when you like when I first</v>
<v Speaker 1>moved here,</v>

2594
02:01:32.350 --> 02:01:36.580
<v Speaker 1>it was my first like real adult job and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I figured out I was working in 30% of</v>

2595
02:01:36.581 --> 02:01:39.530
<v Speaker 1>the time for the government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They take 30% yeah,</v>

2596
02:01:39.590 --> 02:01:42.090
<v Speaker 1>directly out of and it just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it blew my mind.</v>

2597
02:01:42.091 --> 02:01:43.910
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then like I don't know what's going</v>

2598
02:01:43.911 --> 02:01:45.470
<v Speaker 1>on with trump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like in the last election,</v>

2599
02:01:45.650 --> 02:01:48.890
<v Speaker 1>I think Mitt Romney finally came out</v>
<v Speaker 1>until he paid like something like 17%</v>

2600
02:01:49.580 --> 02:01:51.630
<v Speaker 1>which is not like they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an,</v>

2601
02:01:51.631 --> 02:01:52.730
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so sad.</v>

2602
02:01:52.731 --> 02:01:54.890
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it frustrates people when like the rich</v>

2603
02:01:54.891 --> 02:01:58.680
<v Speaker 1>people can have all those deductions and</v>
<v Speaker 1>pay 17% oh yeah,</v>

2604
02:01:58.850 --> 02:02:02.270
<v Speaker 1>we're paying 30 well there's tax</v>
<v Speaker 1>shelters and then there's also storing</v>

2605
02:02:02.271 --> 02:02:03.200
<v Speaker 1>money overseas.</v>

2606
02:02:03.200 --> 02:02:05.150
<v Speaker 1>That's where thing gets things gear real</v>
<v Speaker 1>weird.</v>

2607
02:02:05.420 --> 02:02:10.310
<v Speaker 1>Cause there's a lot of super fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>uber rich people that have a fuck load</v>

2608
02:02:10.311 --> 02:02:14.660
<v Speaker 1>of money stored overseas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And by doing that and by these oh,</v>

2609
02:02:14.700 --> 02:02:18.680
<v Speaker 1>these overseas tax shelters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can fucking hide a lot of money.</v>

2610
02:02:18.830 --> 02:02:22.340
<v Speaker 1>You know who's got that going on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember that dude who had those late</v>

2611
02:02:22.340 --> 02:02:24.410
<v Speaker 1>night commercials,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the weight loss secrets.</v>

2612
02:02:24.411 --> 02:02:26.540
<v Speaker 1>They don't want you to know about Kevin</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trudeau.</v>

2613
02:02:26.810 --> 02:02:28.490
<v Speaker 1>Remember that Kevin Trudeau guy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2614
02:02:28.610 --> 02:02:33.610
<v Speaker 1>That guy made a fucking grip of money</v>
<v Speaker 1>ripping people off and vanished and uh,</v>

2615
02:02:34.970 --> 02:02:36.740
<v Speaker 1>he went to jail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he went to jail.</v>

2616
02:02:36.741 --> 02:02:38.590
<v Speaker 1>But the money vanished.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he just like,</v>

2617
02:02:38.591 --> 02:02:40.790
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot like he's claiming he</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't know where any of it is.</v>

2618
02:02:41.210 --> 02:02:43.940
<v Speaker 1>And so then they'll lock them up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to lock them up for like</v>

2619
02:02:43.941 --> 02:02:46.100
<v Speaker 1>10 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then once he gets out,</v>

2620
02:02:46.101 --> 02:02:47.650
<v Speaker 1>that guy's going to get in the fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>raft.</v>

2621
02:02:47.650 --> 02:02:50.780
<v Speaker 1>It's going to peddle out to the middle</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the ocean to get picked up by a yacht</v>

2622
02:02:51.140 --> 02:02:55.010
<v Speaker 1>and swept off to Costa Rica or wherever</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fuck he's got that money hidden like</v>

2623
02:02:55.250 --> 02:02:58.220
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of these reg really rich dudes,</v>

2624
02:02:58.520 --> 02:03:02.420
<v Speaker 1>they figure out a way to preserve as</v>
<v Speaker 1>much of that money as possible.</v>

2625
02:03:02.570 --> 02:03:05.480
<v Speaker 1>That's why they kind of like Bernie</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sanders comes along and they fucking</v>

2626
02:03:05.481 --> 02:03:08.330
<v Speaker 1>freak out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was shot him up,</v>

2627
02:03:08.570 --> 02:03:13.570
<v Speaker 1>shut him up the fuck is he saying he</v>
<v Speaker 1>wants more people to pay how much and</v>

2628
02:03:14.310 --> 02:03:18.530
<v Speaker 1>then there's like there's rates while he</v>
<v Speaker 1>was in favor of like say if you make a</v>

2629
02:03:18.531 --> 02:03:21.440
<v Speaker 1>certain amount of year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you make more than $15 million a</v>

2630
02:03:21.441 --> 02:03:23.540
<v Speaker 1>year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's just make up a number then every</v>

2631
02:03:23.541 --> 02:03:28.541
<v Speaker 1>dollar over that they could tax you buy</v>
<v Speaker 1>like some stupid amount wasn't only 90%</v>

2632
02:03:28.670 --> 02:03:29.550
<v Speaker 1>percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2633
02:03:30.290 --> 02:03:33.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said he didn't think that was too</v>

2634
02:03:33.801 --> 02:03:34.634
<v Speaker 1>much.</v>

2635
02:03:34.940 --> 02:03:39.050
<v Speaker 1>The idea is like you shouldn't be</v>
<v Speaker 1>winning the game that that much like if</v>

2636
02:03:39.350 --> 02:03:43.340
<v Speaker 1>the game is about money and the idea is</v>
<v Speaker 1>like well we should probably be control</v>

2637
02:03:43.341 --> 02:03:45.770
<v Speaker 1>how much money people make.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause it shouldn't be just about money,</v>

2638
02:03:45.940 --> 02:03:48.410
<v Speaker 1>should be about productivity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much you contribute.</v>

2639
02:03:48.770 --> 02:03:52.010
<v Speaker 1>It shouldn't be that you figure out how</v>
<v Speaker 1>to move numbers around and some</v>

2640
02:03:52.011 --> 02:03:56.090
<v Speaker 1>accounts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And because of that you've made $3</v>

2641
02:03:56.090 --> 02:03:57.170
<v Speaker 1>billion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what have you done?</v>

2642
02:03:57.171 --> 02:03:59.150
<v Speaker 1>What have you actually contributed to</v>
<v Speaker 1>society?</v>

2643
02:03:59.450 --> 02:04:02.690
<v Speaker 1>You figured out some weird little</v>
<v Speaker 1>loopholes and little sneaky ways you can</v>

2644
02:04:02.691 --> 02:04:07.610
<v Speaker 1>move ones and Zeros around on servers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And because of that you've made $1</v>

2645
02:04:07.610 --> 02:04:10.490
<v Speaker 1>billion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like so his idea is that that shouldn't</v>

2646
02:04:10.491 --> 02:04:12.350
<v Speaker 1>be possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that after,</v>

2647
02:04:12.470 --> 02:04:14.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not like you can't be rich,</v>

2648
02:04:14.240 --> 02:04:16.760
<v Speaker 1>but everything after like $15 million a</v>
<v Speaker 1>year,</v>

2649
02:04:16.761 --> 02:04:18.740
<v Speaker 1>you got to fucking just give it all</v>
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>

2650
02:04:19.340 --> 02:04:21.620
<v Speaker 1>But that people are not going to work</v>
<v Speaker 1>that hard.</v>

2651
02:04:22.040 --> 02:04:25.010
<v Speaker 1>They're going to get to that $15 million</v>
<v Speaker 1>a year mark and they got a slow it down,</v>

2652
02:04:25.011 --> 02:04:26.900
<v Speaker 1>a backing off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just go on vacation.</v>

2653
02:04:26.901 --> 02:04:28.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're every,</v>

2654
02:04:28.280 --> 02:04:32.510
<v Speaker 1>well it slows productivity cause those</v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy fucks is dark as it is.</v>

2655
02:04:32.511 --> 02:04:35.030
<v Speaker 1>Like they have to be washed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's just gotta be some regulation</v>

2656
02:04:35.031 --> 02:04:36.830
<v Speaker 1>because greedy fucking people get</v>
<v Speaker 1>greedy.</v>

2657
02:04:36.990 --> 02:04:40.710
<v Speaker 1>But if you don't have their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their ability to push it to the limit,</v>

2658
02:04:40.800 --> 02:04:44.790
<v Speaker 1>if they don't have that ability,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll have a lot less things that are</v>

2659
02:04:44.791 --> 02:04:47.880
<v Speaker 1>new,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot less innovation does be a lot</v>

2660
02:04:47.881 --> 02:04:49.110
<v Speaker 1>less.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2661
02:04:49.200 --> 02:04:52.950
<v Speaker 1>the companies like huge companies like</v>
<v Speaker 1>apple and companies where you buy like</v>

2662
02:04:52.951 --> 02:04:54.870
<v Speaker 1>awesome shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be a lot less of them.</v>

2663
02:04:55.560 --> 02:04:58.260
<v Speaker 1>They just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are not going to push that hard</v>

2664
02:04:59.310 --> 02:05:01.320
<v Speaker 1>cause they did not going to get the</v>
<v Speaker 1>benefits that you like.</v>

2665
02:05:01.410 --> 02:05:05.850
<v Speaker 1>You get crazy benefits when you're some</v>
<v Speaker 1>Elon musk character.</v>

2666
02:05:06.060 --> 02:05:07.860
<v Speaker 1>You know when you've got billions and</v>
<v Speaker 1>billions of dollars.</v>

2667
02:05:07.861 --> 02:05:11.250
<v Speaker 1>He's a crazy benefit to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not just a benefit in terms of like</v>

2668
02:05:11.251 --> 02:05:16.251
<v Speaker 1>being a guy who's like an innovator and</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who makes cool shit.</v>

2669
02:05:16.801 --> 02:05:20.460
<v Speaker 1>But there's also benefits financially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the guy lives in a castle,</v>

2670
02:05:20.490 --> 02:05:22.320
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He can do whatever the fuck he wants.</v>

2671
02:05:22.321 --> 02:05:26.100
<v Speaker 1>He flies around in private jets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're limiting people and living in</v>

2672
02:05:26.101 --> 02:05:28.350
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the amount of money they can make that</v>

2673
02:05:28.351 --> 02:05:30.240
<v Speaker 1>drastically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to lose a lot of those</v>

2674
02:05:30.241 --> 02:05:32.910
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a good argument for a</v>

2675
02:05:34.040 --> 02:05:35.090
<v Speaker 8>going against</v>

2676
02:05:36.220 --> 02:05:40.120
<v Speaker 1>sort of organizing wealth to the point</v>
<v Speaker 1>where wealth distribution,</v>

2677
02:05:40.990 --> 02:05:43.240
<v Speaker 1>but it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the reality of human nature.</v>

2678
02:05:43.870 --> 02:05:44.720
<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>people,</v>

2679
02:05:45.320 --> 02:05:47.870
<v Speaker 8>people aren't gonna work that hard if</v>
<v Speaker 8>they can't make a grip of money they</v>

2680
02:05:47.871 --> 02:05:51.580
<v Speaker 8>want to make.</v>
<v Speaker 8>But again,</v>

2681
02:05:53.450 --> 02:05:55.890
<v Speaker 8>I put a box of $2 million and I leave</v>
<v Speaker 8>with you.</v>

2682
02:05:55.950 --> 02:05:59.420
<v Speaker 8>I think at the fucking wake.</v>
<v Speaker 8>My wife cause you to my and then I have</v>

2683
02:05:59.421 --> 02:06:01.460
<v Speaker 8>to pay.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Would you have to,</v>

2684
02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:03.260
<v Speaker 8>why?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Because you go to jail.</v>

2685
02:06:03.350 --> 02:06:06.770
<v Speaker 8>How would you,</v>
<v Speaker 8>how would they find that?</v>

2686
02:06:07.330 --> 02:06:09.620
<v Speaker 8>They're going to find out because I have</v>
<v Speaker 8>$2 million all of a sudden.</v>

2687
02:06:09.621 --> 02:06:11.150
<v Speaker 8>No they're not.</v>
<v Speaker 8>What do I do with the money?</v>

2688
02:06:11.151 --> 02:06:12.770
<v Speaker 8>Just keep it in a bag.</v>
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>

2689
02:06:13.910 --> 02:06:14.461
<v Speaker 8>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you,</v>

2690
02:06:14.461 --> 02:06:15.500
<v Speaker 8>you money has like,</v>

2691
02:06:16.010 --> 02:06:18.430
<v Speaker 1>like they could find out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if they see is,</v>

2692
02:06:18.450 --> 02:06:19.340
<v Speaker 1>here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

2693
02:06:19.520 --> 02:06:23.480
<v Speaker 1>if they found out you're going to jail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd have to trust the person.</v>

2694
02:06:23.540 --> 02:06:25.160
<v Speaker 1>If you have $2 million,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

2695
02:06:25.190 --> 02:06:28.160
<v Speaker 1>if you have $2 million and you go to</v>
<v Speaker 1>jail,</v>

2696
02:06:28.161 --> 02:06:31.310
<v Speaker 1>you would give that $2 million back to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get out of jail.</v>

2697
02:06:31.990 --> 02:06:34.480
<v Speaker 8>You wouldn't know somebody who died and</v>
<v Speaker 8>left a million cash.</v>

2698
02:06:34.481 --> 02:06:36.910
<v Speaker 8>It was illegal type shady character in</v>
<v Speaker 8>their hands.</v>

2699
02:06:37.060 --> 02:06:41.170
<v Speaker 8>The money went to three different places</v>
<v Speaker 8>and now the sisters got it and she never</v>

2700
02:06:41.171 --> 02:06:43.120
<v Speaker 8>paid taxes.</v>
<v Speaker 8>She just came from Cuba.</v>

2701
02:06:43.290 --> 02:06:45.010

<v Speaker 8>there.</v>

2702
02:06:46.110 --> 02:06:48.500
<v Speaker 8>If I gave you $2 million,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the first thing you'd do is go to the</v>

2703
02:06:48.510 --> 02:06:52.030
<v Speaker 8>Lee.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Lee's got a restaurant on Ventura</v>

2710
02:07:08.470 --> 02:07:11.320
<v Speaker 8>million dollars that you left me.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That's an interesting way to do it.</v>

2711
02:07:11.390 --> 02:07:14.210
<v Speaker 8>To have like a no workshop you to pay</v>

<v Speaker 8>doing the paperwork this month.</v>

2716
02:07:25.780 --> 02:07:28.950
<v Speaker 8>Well that would work if you could do it</v>
<v Speaker 8>this way to do it.</v>

2717
02:07:29.260 --> 02:07:31.480
<v Speaker 8>Somebody leaves me 2 million fucking</v>
<v Speaker 8>dollars.</v>

2718
02:07:31.750 --> 02:07:34.900

<v Speaker 5>justify getting that money like that.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Where do you get that hundred thousand</v>
<v Speaker 5>dollars where'd that go?</v>

2730
02:08:05.680 --> 02:08:08.380

<v Speaker 5>You see what happened to Johnny Depp in</v>

2731
02:08:08.381 --> 02:08:11.770
<v Speaker 5>that movie there with the coke?</v>
<v Speaker 5>When he went back down in the Panamanian</v>

2732
02:08:11.771 --> 02:08:15.670
<v Speaker 5>government took his fucking money.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It took $250 million from a little more</v>

2733
02:08:15.800 --> 02:08:17.770
<v Speaker 5>blow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That happens all the time.</v>

2734
02:08:18.250 --> 02:08:20.620
<v Speaker 5>That happens all the fucking time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They'll switch back accounts.</v>

2735
02:08:20.621 --> 02:08:23.560
<v Speaker 5>You trust somebody with your fucking $10</v>
<v Speaker 5>million over that.</v>

2736
02:08:23.650 --> 02:08:27.040
<v Speaker 5>Really for me to put $10 million,</v>
<v Speaker 5>12 hours from me,</v>

2737
02:08:27.330 --> 02:08:29.500
<v Speaker 5>I can have 10 million.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was close by too.</v>

2738
02:08:32.250 --> 02:08:35.110
<v Speaker 5>That's gotta be so I know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Thousand you know if,</v>

2739
02:08:35.160 --> 02:08:39.630
<v Speaker 5>if when they watched narcos,</v>
<v Speaker 5>those fucking Panamanians whenever they</v>

2740
02:08:39.631 --> 02:08:40.800
<v Speaker 5>were,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they making so much money.</v>

2741
02:08:40.801 --> 02:08:44.790
<v Speaker 5>They were burying that Colombians</v>
<v Speaker 5>burying it looked like it was seeds.</v>

2742
02:08:44.880 --> 02:08:46.980
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just plant the money tree.</v>

2743
02:08:47.010 --> 02:08:48.720
<v Speaker 5>They had to figure out where to put it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What are they saying?</v>

2744
02:08:48.721 --> 02:08:51.690
<v Speaker 5>He spent 2,500 a month on rubber bands.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Four or something crazy.</v>

2745
02:08:54.720 --> 02:08:57.770
<v Speaker 5>You know how many millions of dollars?</v>
<v Speaker 5>20 how much money?</v>

2746
02:08:57.900 --> 02:09:00.990
<v Speaker 5>500 is what I saw on rubber bands at one</v>
<v Speaker 5>time.</v>

2747
02:09:00.991 --> 02:09:03.000
<v Speaker 5>He broke $1 million just to stay warm.</v>

2748
02:09:04.930 --> 02:09:06.340
<v Speaker 5>Jesus cried.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was cold at night.</v>

2749
02:09:06.341 --> 02:09:08.890
<v Speaker 5>He just put money on the thing limit</v>
<v Speaker 5>just to stay warm.</v>

2750
02:09:10.180 --> 02:09:12.880
<v Speaker 5>I wonder what keeps a guy like that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Here's a perfect example.</v>

2751
02:09:12.910 --> 02:09:16.540
<v Speaker 5>I mean not it's obviously drug dealing</v>
<v Speaker 5>and not capitalism,</v>

2752
02:09:16.780 --> 02:09:19.330
<v Speaker 5>but what keeps a guy pushing when he's</v>
<v Speaker 5>making that much money?</v>

2753
02:09:19.510 --> 02:09:22.240
<v Speaker 5>What keeps the guy from Virgin American</v>
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

2754
02:09:22.241 --> 02:09:25.180
<v Speaker 5>keeps an American,</v>
<v Speaker 5>will keeps trump building and making</v>

2755
02:09:25.181 --> 02:09:26.530
<v Speaker 5>millions of things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What is it?</v>

2756
02:09:26.710 --> 02:09:28.120
<v Speaker 5>Power,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2757
02:09:28.900 --> 02:09:30.980
<v Speaker 5>It's gotta be three of the seven.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2758
02:09:30.990 --> 02:09:33.220
<v Speaker 5>You were speaking about addiction to</v>
<v Speaker 5>drama earlier.</v>

2759
02:09:33.250 --> 02:09:35.050
<v Speaker 5>It seems like.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What would be the same thing?</v>

2760
02:09:35.051 --> 02:09:37.660
<v Speaker 5>Get Your Dick sucked by that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Listen,</v>

2761
02:09:37.690 --> 02:09:42.640
<v Speaker 5>that rats ate $1 billion of Pablo</v>
<v Speaker 5>Escobar's profits each year.</v>

2762
02:09:46.060 --> 02:09:48.640
<v Speaker 5>He was earning so much a year.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We would write off 10% of the money</v>

2763
02:09:48.641 --> 02:09:52.330
<v Speaker 5>because rats would eat it in storage or</v>
<v Speaker 5>be damaged by water or lost.</v>

2764
02:09:52.331 --> 02:09:56.120
<v Speaker 5>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cartel spent 25 yeah,</v>

2765
02:09:56.121 --> 02:09:57.910
<v Speaker 5>and rubber bands to hold the money</v>
<v Speaker 5>together.</v>

2766
02:09:58.150 --> 02:10:01.090
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is a crazy stats,</v>

2767
02:10:01.600 --> 02:10:04.780
<v Speaker 5>but the thing about Escobar's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he made more money than you could ever</v>

2768
02:10:04.781 --> 02:10:08.800
<v Speaker 5>possibly spend and yet he kept working.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He kept wanting that money to come in.</v>

2769
02:10:09.010 --> 02:10:13.090
<v Speaker 5>He kept working and from the little I've</v>
<v Speaker 5>seen people loved him there.</v>

2770
02:10:13.200 --> 02:10:15.040
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cause he would build soccer stadiums and</v>

2771
02:10:15.041 --> 02:10:16.990
<v Speaker 5>do all of them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that's part of the reason why</v>

2772
02:10:16.991 --> 02:10:20.680
<v Speaker 5>people get annoyed with trump or whoever</v>
<v Speaker 5>you want to say here because it doesn't</v>

2773
02:10:20.681 --> 02:10:23.230
<v Speaker 5>seem like they're doing anything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well it's also that thing when you're</v>

2774
02:10:23.231 --> 02:10:27.280
<v Speaker 5>selling drugs you get locked up in a</v>
<v Speaker 5>business like Escobar was we had so much</v>

2775
02:10:27.281 --> 02:10:30.400
<v Speaker 5>power and so much drugs he was selling.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't want to give that power to</v>

2776
02:10:30.401 --> 02:10:33.190
<v Speaker 5>somebody else.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So once you've got that whole thing down</v>

2777
02:10:33.200 --> 02:10:33.980
<v Speaker 5>and you're making all that</v>

2778
02:10:33.980 --> 02:10:37.160
<v Speaker 1>money like do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you must be incredibly reluctant to give</v>

2779
02:10:37.161 --> 02:10:39.770
<v Speaker 1>that up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean think about how long it took him</v>

2780
02:10:39.830 --> 02:10:43.820
<v Speaker 1>to to put together the network to make</v>
<v Speaker 1>the kind of money that he was making</v>

2781
02:10:43.821 --> 02:10:47.060
<v Speaker 1>towards the end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very reluctant to just hand that over to</v>

2782
02:10:47.061 --> 02:10:50.590
<v Speaker 1>somebody else because the business is</v>
<v Speaker 1>always going to be there that the demand</v>

2783
02:10:50.591 --> 02:10:52.970
<v Speaker 1>is always going to be there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the supplies it was going to be there,</v>

2784
02:10:53.330 --> 02:10:56.780
<v Speaker 1>like who's making these transactions?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just have to give it to somebody</v>

2785
02:10:56.781 --> 02:10:59.030
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then plus you'd open yourself up to</v>

2786
02:10:59.031 --> 02:11:03.020
<v Speaker 1>all these other fucking drug dealers</v>
<v Speaker 1>becoming just as crazy as you were when</v>

2787
02:11:03.021 --> 02:11:05.540
<v Speaker 1>you're coked up and nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

2788
02:11:05.720 --> 02:11:06.130
<v Speaker 1>I read it.</v>

2789
02:11:06.130 --> 02:11:09.150
<v Speaker 8>One of his books,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I read one of the books by a Colombian</v>

2790
02:11:09.190 --> 02:11:11.980
<v Speaker 8>journalists,</v>
<v Speaker 8>like I just don't read any off of.</v>

2791
02:11:11.981 --> 02:11:15.250
<v Speaker 8>This guy was referred to me like this</v>
<v Speaker 8>guy really worked in the transit.</v>

2792
02:11:15.730 --> 02:11:18.890
<v Speaker 8>He was an amazing</v>
<v Speaker 8>eye.</v>

2793
02:11:19.030 --> 02:11:23.860
<v Speaker 8>He couldn't read any CEO fucking 500</v>
<v Speaker 8>company and how it's them with a third</v>

2794
02:11:23.861 --> 02:11:25.570

<v Speaker 8>What did he have?</v>

2795
02:11:26.080 --> 02:11:29.590
<v Speaker 8>He knew he knew what he had.</v>
<v Speaker 8>He knew the price.</v>

2796
02:11:30.010 --> 02:11:34.750
<v Speaker 8>He knew how to buy people off and he</v>
<v Speaker 8>knew how to speak like he was a fucking</v>

2797
02:11:34.751 --> 02:11:36.460
<v Speaker 8>Yanno like have you looked at them in</v>
<v Speaker 8>the street?</v>

<v Speaker 1>I trust Dan hope,</v>

2828
02:13:03.641 --> 02:13:06.460

<v Speaker 1>that she was manipulating him and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was going to,</v>

2830
02:13:10.090 --> 02:13:12.850
<v Speaker 1>she had said and he had was worried that</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was going to do this.</v>

2831
02:13:14.200 --> 02:13:16.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Johnny Depp was being blackmailed by</v>

2832
02:13:16.001 --> 02:13:18.400
<v Speaker 1>amber heard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's how I know guest column,</v>

2833
02:13:18.520 --> 02:13:23.520
<v Speaker 1>Doug's Dan hope the rap bunch of people</v>
<v Speaker 1>got upset at me for tweeting that it's</v>

2834
02:13:24.281 --> 02:13:27.400
<v Speaker 1>cause it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not supposed to take a side.</v>

2835
02:13:28.800 --> 02:13:30.290
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you do take aside,</v>

2836
02:13:30.400 --> 02:13:32.130
<v Speaker 1>do you have to take the side because a</v>
<v Speaker 1>woman's</v>

2837
02:13:32.400 --> 02:13:35.700
<v Speaker 5>should could potentially be actually</v>
<v Speaker 5>getting abused.</v>

2838
02:13:35.730 --> 02:13:37.590
<v Speaker 5>Did he get arrested?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think so.</v>

2839
02:13:37.950 --> 02:13:41.580
<v Speaker 5>The cops came and I think they found no</v>
<v Speaker 5>evidence of what happens when the cops</v>

2840
02:13:41.581 --> 02:13:43.170
<v Speaker 5>come and there's an argument now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2841
02:13:43.171 --> 02:13:44.400
<v Speaker 5>they take you away.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not good.</v>

2842
02:13:44.610 --> 02:13:45.660
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They take the man away.</v>

2843
02:13:45.690 --> 02:13:46.770
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm also wasn't there.</v>

2844
02:13:46.771 --> 02:13:48.510
<v Speaker 5>He split the scene.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did he?</v>

2845
02:13:48.630 --> 02:13:49.590
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he fled the scene.</v>

2846
02:13:49.620 --> 02:13:52.320
<v Speaker 5>But if there was a problem they'll come</v>
<v Speaker 5>and got it.</v>

2847
02:13:53.040 --> 02:13:57.150
<v Speaker 5>So with the pictures,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if there was pictures and shit's broken</v>

2848
02:13:57.151 --> 02:13:59.700
<v Speaker 5>now because of old Jay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have to,</v>

2849
02:14:00.210 --> 02:14:04.070
<v Speaker 5>especially in La.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2850
02:14:04.140 --> 02:14:08.160
<v Speaker 5>it's specially in la,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's weird how many people like</v>

2851
02:14:08.161 --> 02:14:10.170
<v Speaker 5>automatically assumed that he was</v>
<v Speaker 5>beating her up.</v>

2852
02:14:11.930 --> 02:14:14.970
<v Speaker 5>It's um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why is it that someone wants to pick a</v>

2853
02:14:14.971 --> 02:14:18.840
<v Speaker 5>side?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is it like to show that you're a good</v>

2854
02:14:18.841 --> 02:14:21.210
<v Speaker 5>person and you side with the woman</v>
<v Speaker 5>always.</v>

2855
02:14:21.540 --> 02:14:22.170
<v Speaker 5>Is that what it is?</v>

2856
02:14:22.170 --> 02:14:23.460
<v Speaker 5>Like what's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like why,</v>

2857
02:14:23.820 --> 02:14:28.500
<v Speaker 5>why do people pretend that some people</v>
<v Speaker 5>aren't manipulative at some?</v>

2858
02:14:28.501 --> 02:14:31.770
<v Speaker 5>Some people are manipulative and we know</v>
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

2859
02:14:31.771 --> 02:14:32.910
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>We know some people are going to be</v>

2860
02:14:32.911 --> 02:14:34.770
<v Speaker 5>live.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We know some people lie and we know some</v>

2861
02:14:34.771 --> 02:14:36.330
<v Speaker 5>people set people up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We know some people,</v>

2862
02:14:36.331 --> 02:14:37.710
<v Speaker 5>black male,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we know that's real,</v>

2863
02:14:37.920 --> 02:14:40.410
<v Speaker 5>but why?</v>
<v Speaker 5>How come when it's a girl we all of a</v>

2864
02:14:40.411 --> 02:14:41.940
<v Speaker 5>sudden go away.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't think that way,</v>

2865
02:14:42.570 --> 02:14:44.100
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't believe you're supporting a wife</v>

2866
02:14:44.101 --> 02:14:44.934
<v Speaker 5>beater.</v>

<v Speaker 5>she knew that she had a scar.</v>

2868
02:14:46.981 --> 02:14:50.580
<v Speaker 5>She had a scar over her eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She got a restraining order.</v>

2869
02:14:50.640 --> 02:14:52.800
<v Speaker 5>I just can't figure out why they didn't</v>
<v Speaker 5>arrest him.</v>

2870
02:14:53.850 --> 02:14:55.890
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe he's got recordings or something,</v>

2871
02:14:56.280 --> 02:14:58.740
<v Speaker 5>maybe know something,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he definitely has a bunch of</v>

2872
02:14:58.741 --> 02:14:59.910
<v Speaker 5>witnesses saying that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

<v Speaker 8>talk about a gay relative.</v>

2923
02:17:02.030 --> 02:17:06.410
<v Speaker 8>That's why I always knew that gay guys</v>

<v Speaker 8>That's just never going to work.</v>

2925
02:17:09.741 --> 02:17:14.000
<v Speaker 8>It's like a hidden thing.</v>
<v Speaker 8>But remember when they first introduced</v>

<v Speaker 8>A lot of people can't say that in</v>

2931
02:17:27.561 --> 02:17:29.240
<v Speaker 8>public.</v>

<v Speaker 4>She's young and hot and obviously if</v>

3008
02:21:21.590 --> 02:21:23.840
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if doug and Johnny Depp or telling the</v>

<v Speaker 4>celebrity,</v>

3013
02:21:31.701 --> 02:21:35.450
<v Speaker 4>to the extent of Johnny Depp,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he hasn't been not famous for more than</v>

3014

<v Speaker 1>This is dark.</v>

3069
02:24:19.261 --> 02:24:23.130
<v Speaker 1>This is like sorcery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is so strange when she can't even</v>

3070
02:24:23.131 --> 02:24:27.630
<v Speaker 1>possibly pretend that he's attractive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's like our dad man.</v>

3071
02:24:28.350 --> 02:24:32.550
<v Speaker 1>She was married to Mick Jagger and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>told her the wedding was Nolan boy cause</v>

3072
02:24:32.551 --> 02:24:34.890
<v Speaker 1>they got married on an island.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shock.</v>

3073
02:24:36.870 --> 02:24:39.960
<v Speaker 1>Johnny Louie C for a guy like Rupert</v>
<v Speaker 1>Murdoch.</v>

3074
02:24:39.990 --> 02:24:41.040
<v Speaker 1>That's a prize.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He look,</v>

3075
02:24:41.041 --> 02:24:44.100
<v Speaker 1>he's got a bunch of Chinese kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kids are like half Chinese.</v>

3076
02:24:44.250 --> 02:24:46.350
<v Speaker 1>That's the ex wife.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the last one he jettisoned.</v>

3077
02:24:47.100 --> 02:24:49.650
<v Speaker 1>She talked too much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't bow hard enough.</v>

3078
02:24:50.370 --> 02:24:53.860
<v Speaker 1>I still see your face when you bow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one.</v>

3079
02:24:53.910 --> 02:24:56.870
<v Speaker 1>Let's find out what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why am I tmz and uh,</v>

3080
02:24:57.270 --> 02:25:00.360
<v Speaker 1>Rupert Murdoch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he said he had some hot wife before</v>

3081
02:25:00.361 --> 02:25:01.500
<v Speaker 1>that Jerry Hall.</v>

3082
02:25:01.530 --> 02:25:04.260
<v Speaker 1>Good luck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But my point was that I really think</v>

3083
02:25:04.261 --> 02:25:07.470
<v Speaker 1>that this lady,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if she just divorced him,</v>

3084
02:25:07.890 --> 02:25:10.860
<v Speaker 1>but I guess she wanted a lot of money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She might've been greedy.</v>

3085
02:25:10.861 --> 02:25:13.500
<v Speaker 1>She might've been angry at him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3086
02:25:13.590 --> 02:25:15.480
<v Speaker 1>who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it'd be more than 10 because it</v>

3087
02:25:15.481 --> 02:25:19.500
<v Speaker 1>was half of what they made in that year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they said he got paid 40 and 60 so</v>

3088
02:25:19.501 --> 02:25:24.070
<v Speaker 1>that's near 50 no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's half of what he is his money</v>

3089
02:25:24.071 --> 02:25:25.990
<v Speaker 1>increased by.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

3090
02:25:25.991 --> 02:25:28.180
<v Speaker 1>so let's pull that up again so we get a</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at it.</v>

3091
02:25:28.181 --> 02:25:31.300
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure that's what it says.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it said half of what it like,</v>

3092
02:25:31.301 --> 02:25:34.870
<v Speaker 1>say if he made $20 million one year and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then $30 million with her,</v>

3093
02:25:35.650 --> 02:25:39.040
<v Speaker 1>half of that 10 yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't get a half of the fourth</v>

3094
02:25:39.050 --> 02:25:43.030
<v Speaker 1>amendment guarantees her a minimum of</v>
<v Speaker 1>one half of however much they're</v>

3095
02:25:43.031 --> 02:25:43.720
<v Speaker 1>combined.</v>

3096
02:25:43.720 --> 02:25:46.510
<v Speaker 1>Worth increased during their 15 months</v>
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>

3097
02:25:47.410 --> 02:25:52.410
<v Speaker 1>So she made $10 more that year and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Johnny made 50 million more.</v>

3098
02:25:53.260 --> 02:25:54.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's madness,</v>

3099
02:25:54.161 --> 02:25:54.671

<v Speaker 5>These three little more than bitches are</v>
<v Speaker 5>going to come back.</v>

<v Speaker 5>When they asked me to get the water,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they stole my pot pipe from the balcony.</v>

3174
02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:54.200
<v Speaker 5>Nobody else was on that balcony,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but water got comes on that balcony and</v>

<v Speaker 5>I don't leave weed up there.</v>

3176
02:28:56.350 --> 02:28:58.520
<v Speaker 5>I'm not that stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just leave the pipe with the cleaner,</v>

3177
02:28:59.000 --> 02:29:00.860

02:29:11.751 --> 02:29:13.340
<v Speaker 5>I couldn't find them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They never came back.</v>

3183
02:29:13.910 --> 02:29:17.990
<v Speaker 5>They stole my pot pipe.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you think they stole it because they</v>

3184
02:29:17.991 --> 02:29:20.750
<v Speaker 5>were just stealing things or do you</v>
<v Speaker 5>think they stole it because they didn't</v>

3185
02:29:20.751 --> 02:29:24.050
<v Speaker 5>want you to be engaging in such horrible</v>
<v Speaker 5>behavior?</v>

3186
02:29:24.350 --> 02:29:26.870
<v Speaker 5>Smoking marijuana while you're taking</v>
<v Speaker 5>care of your child?</v>

3187
02:29:26.871 --> 02:29:28.550
<v Speaker 5>I wasn't smoking when I was taking care</v>
<v Speaker 5>of the child.</v>

<v Speaker 5>It's always out.</v>

<v Speaker 5>we need to take this from him?</v>

3192

<v Speaker 5>door to the face.</v>

3197
02:29:55.160 --> 02:29:57.980
<v Speaker 5>Then you have another one that you kept</v>
<v Speaker 5>like he kept coming back.</v>

3198

<v Speaker 5>an hour and see him lurking in front of</v>
<v Speaker 5>my house.</v>

3201
02:30:06.681 --> 02:30:07.940

3203
02:30:10.071 --> 02:30:11.870
<v Speaker 5>him was strung out for like four months</v>
<v Speaker 5>though.</v>

3204

<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3213
02:30:27.110 --> 02:30:29.570
<v Speaker 5>in the hallways.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One time a girl was selling cookies.</v>

3214
02:30:29.850 --> 02:30:32.900
<v Speaker 5>It was pretty hot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible] I invited around.</v>

3215
02:30:32.960 --> 02:30:36.800
<v Speaker 5>What happened?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nothing close the deal.</v>

3216
02:30:36.801 --> 02:30:39.560
<v Speaker 5>Back then I was like 21 did you buy the</v>
<v Speaker 5>cookies?</v>

3217
02:30:39.660 --> 02:30:41.420
<v Speaker 5>I thanks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So thinking about cookies,</v>

3218
02:30:41.450 --> 02:30:43.130
<v Speaker 5>I don't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just remember her being hot.</v>

3219
02:30:43.660 --> 02:30:45.920
<v Speaker 5>It's fucking ass.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But y'all didn't smells a lot of cookies</v>

3220
02:30:47.270 --> 02:30:50.150
<v Speaker 5>knocking on people's doors.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Speaking about taxing or what about</v>

3221
02:30:50.151 --> 02:30:55.151
<v Speaker 5>those religions that make you give like</v>
<v Speaker 5>10% church tithing on top of taxes?</v>

3222
02:30:55.940 --> 02:30:56.601
<v Speaker 5>Tithing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

3223
02:30:56.601 --> 02:30:58.280
<v Speaker 5>thank God.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We had a guy in fear factor,</v>

3224
02:30:58.580 --> 02:31:01.550
<v Speaker 5>they want 1 million bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't really win 1 million bucks</v>

3225
02:31:01.580 --> 02:31:05.360
<v Speaker 5>because the government takes a big chunk</v>
<v Speaker 5>and most people they take the one time</v>

3226
02:31:05.361 --> 02:31:08.270
<v Speaker 5>payment instead of like the 50 grand a</v>
<v Speaker 5>year for the rest of your life,</v>

3227
02:31:08.271 --> 02:31:09.850
<v Speaker 5>that kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3228
02:31:09.860 --> 02:31:13.040
<v Speaker 5>but this guy before he did the stunt,</v>
<v Speaker 5>started talking in tongues.</v>

3229
02:31:14.240 --> 02:31:16.250
<v Speaker 5>He's like standing on us like cliff</v>
<v Speaker 5>side.</v>

3230
02:31:16.251 --> 02:31:21.251
<v Speaker 5>It's like Sha la La la La La</v>
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible].</v>

3231
02:31:21.830 --> 02:31:24.000
<v Speaker 5>They like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they talk in a made up nonsense</v>

3232
02:31:24.001 --> 02:31:26.310
<v Speaker 5>language,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so like repeats the same sounds over and</v>

3233
02:31:26.311 --> 02:31:28.500
<v Speaker 5>over and over again.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But this talking in tongues,</v>

3234
02:31:28.501 --> 02:31:32.370
<v Speaker 5>he really believed it was like a</v>
<v Speaker 5>religious experience and that God helped</v>

3235
02:31:32.371 --> 02:31:37.020
<v Speaker 5>him win 1 million bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was going through a box of vhs was</v>

3236
02:31:37.021 --> 02:31:41.430
<v Speaker 5>about a month ago and I put one in and I</v>
<v Speaker 5>caught the beginning of the fear factor,</v>

3237
02:31:41.520 --> 02:31:46.230
<v Speaker 5>like one of the second season.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I watched like 15 minutes of it.</v>

3238
02:31:46.320 --> 02:31:51.320
<v Speaker 5>And looking at it now and knowing you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know how the fuck you did that.</v>

3239
02:31:52.940 --> 02:31:55.980
<v Speaker 5>The show should have been,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how long does it take to Joe Rogan?</v>

3240
02:31:55.981 --> 02:31:58.830
<v Speaker 5>Fucks you up?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like how long?</v>

3241
02:31:58.900 --> 02:32:01.610
<v Speaker 5>Remember when Tony Soprano,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I used to beat people up like there's</v>

3242
02:32:01.611 --> 02:32:04.260
<v Speaker 5>somebody would say something and he just</v>
<v Speaker 5>draw bottle and go over and start</v>

3243
02:32:04.261 --> 02:32:05.094
<v Speaker 5>kicking it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

3244
02:32:05.130 --> 02:32:06.840
<v Speaker 5>He'd beat up Georgie like four times.</v>

3245
02:32:06.840 --> 02:32:08.420
<v Speaker 5>Hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He knocked the xy out.</v>

3246
02:32:08.940 --> 02:32:11.370
<v Speaker 5>That's what the episode should have been</v>
<v Speaker 5>like half the time.</v>

3247
02:32:11.371 --> 02:32:14.490
<v Speaker 5>Like in the mid sentence,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you just started punching somebody,</v>

3248
02:32:15.510 --> 02:32:17.820
<v Speaker 5>kicking them when they're on the phone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What do you mean you don't want to eat</v>

3249
02:32:17.821 --> 02:32:20.550
<v Speaker 5>the fucking eggs?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the next level of fear factor.</v>

3250
02:32:21.060 --> 02:32:25.740
<v Speaker 5>Like go on there like with Chris liebing</v>
<v Speaker 5>as the host and every time he like act</v>

3251
02:32:25.741 --> 02:32:27.240
<v Speaker 5>up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they just beat the fuck out of here.</v>

3252
02:32:27.690 --> 02:32:30.800
<v Speaker 5>Like America's ready for seat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fear factor was I had everything else in</v>

3253
02:32:30.801 --> 02:32:32.370
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>90% of the people were cool.</v>

3254
02:32:32.520 --> 02:32:36.240
<v Speaker 5>I think 90% of the time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3255
02:32:36.690 --> 02:32:38.160
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>90% it was some goof.</v>

3256
02:32:38.161 --> 02:32:42.120
<v Speaker 5>He can tell you probably,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I know you would look at him and go,</v>

3257
02:32:42.121 --> 02:32:45.210
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the cameras on as a grown man,</v>

3258
02:32:45.211 --> 02:32:48.750
<v Speaker 5>it's the closest I've ever been to a</v>
<v Speaker 5>street fight or that one that that one</v>

3259
02:32:48.751 --> 02:32:49.710
<v Speaker 5>guy in that persona.</v>

3260
02:32:49.920 --> 02:32:52.350
<v Speaker 5>And if that wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if that wasn't there,</v>

3261
02:32:52.380 --> 02:32:54.840
<v Speaker 5>if that was somewhere else,</v>
<v Speaker 5>instead of like in front of cameras,</v>

3262
02:32:55.080 --> 02:32:59.310
<v Speaker 5>I definitely want to strangle them 100%</v>
<v Speaker 5>like it just the whole thing.</v>

3263
02:32:59.311 --> 02:33:02.250
<v Speaker 5>It was like there was eight cameras</v>
<v Speaker 5>around all these people around and I was</v>

3264
02:33:02.251 --> 02:33:03.900
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to commit to hurting this</v>

3265
02:33:03.901 --> 02:33:06.210
<v Speaker 5>guy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he's a dangerous fuck.</v>

3266
02:33:06.660 --> 02:33:08.940
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that guy could totally sucker punch me.</v>

3267
02:33:08.970 --> 02:33:11.730
<v Speaker 5>He just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he was so amped up and kept coming into</v>

3268
02:33:11.731 --> 02:33:13.380
<v Speaker 5>my face,</v>
<v Speaker 5>kept running towards me.</v>

3269
02:33:13.890 --> 02:33:15.810
<v Speaker 5>I pushed him away,</v>
<v Speaker 5>ran towards me again.</v>

3270
02:33:15.840 --> 02:33:17.970
<v Speaker 5>I pushed him away and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

3271
02:33:18.000 --> 02:33:19.110
<v Speaker 5>this is on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

3272
02:33:19.111 --> 02:33:21.080
<v Speaker 5>I'm not gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not going to pete pushing this guy</v>

3273
02:33:21.081 --> 02:33:22.290
<v Speaker 5>way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not going to take a chance.</v>

3274
02:33:22.291 --> 02:33:25.200
<v Speaker 5>It didn't doing something.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like clamped onto them.</v>

3275
02:33:25.980 --> 02:33:29.710
<v Speaker 5>I was thinking of key attended them or</v>
<v Speaker 5>needing them in the face trying to,</v>

3276
02:33:30.270 --> 02:33:33.510
<v Speaker 5>I was trying to think like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was like legally the good team would</v>

3277
02:33:33.511 --> 02:33:35.610
<v Speaker 5>be as much smarter move because I have</v>
<v Speaker 5>his head.</v>

3278
02:33:35.610 --> 02:33:37.350
<v Speaker 5>I'm definitely sure I get snap them</v>
<v Speaker 5>down.</v>

3279
02:33:37.351 --> 02:33:40.650
<v Speaker 5>I know he's got no defense and if I hit</v>
<v Speaker 5>him in the face it's probably going to</v>

3280
02:33:40.651 --> 02:33:42.150
<v Speaker 5>be ugly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3281
02:33:42.151 --> 02:33:45.060
<v Speaker 5>need someone in the face.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's fucking devastating.</v>

3282
02:33:45.600 --> 02:33:48.270
<v Speaker 5>It's terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's terrible to do someone's face.</v>

3283
02:33:49.410 --> 02:33:52.920
<v Speaker 5>I got kneed in the face.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ones broke my nose,</v>

3284
02:33:53.100 --> 02:33:57.450
<v Speaker 5>my eyes got black and blue.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I had a headache for three fucking days</v>

3285
02:33:59.190 --> 02:34:02.310
<v Speaker 5>after one knee,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one fucking knees straight on the nose,</v>

3286
02:34:02.311 --> 02:34:05.820
<v Speaker 5>just right on the nose.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That amped up that they want to fucking</v>

3287
02:34:05.821 --> 02:34:08.520
<v Speaker 5>physically fight you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like people show amped up.</v>

3288
02:34:08.521 --> 02:34:10.980
<v Speaker 5>They want to actually throw their</v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking limbs at you.</v>

3289
02:34:12.390 --> 02:34:14.640
<v Speaker 5>Boy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everything's gotten so out the window</v>

3290
02:34:14.790 --> 02:34:16.680
<v Speaker 5>and when you're that close screaming at</v>
<v Speaker 5>each other,</v>

3291
02:34:16.681 --> 02:34:18.130
<v Speaker 5>like in each of the guys getting</v>

3292
02:34:18.130 --> 02:34:21.340
<v Speaker 8>in your face,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's so close to like a catastrophic</v>

3293
02:34:21.341 --> 02:34:23.890
<v Speaker 8>injury.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Like anybody that's that nuts that's</v>

3294
02:34:23.891 --> 02:34:27.760
<v Speaker 8>screaming at you inches from your face.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Like all bets are off.</v>

3295
02:34:28.150 --> 02:34:30.850
<v Speaker 8>Like we're on a,</v>
<v Speaker 8>we're on safari rules here.</v>

3296
02:34:30.910 --> 02:34:33.970
<v Speaker 8>Like this is a,</v>
<v Speaker 8>we're in jungled territory.</v>

3297
02:34:33.971 --> 02:34:36.970
<v Speaker 8>This is a very dangerous time.</v>
<v Speaker 8>If it wasn't for a lot of people being</v>

3298
02:34:36.971 --> 02:34:39.640
<v Speaker 8>around particularly like if that happens</v>
<v Speaker 8>and you're alone manage,</v>

3299
02:34:39.650 --> 02:34:43.390
<v Speaker 8>if you're alone in the woods with a guy</v>
<v Speaker 8>who's screaming at you and getting in</v>

3300
02:34:43.391 --> 02:34:46.750
<v Speaker 8>your face like that,</v>
<v Speaker 8>like people die like that all the time.</v>

3301
02:34:46.960 --> 02:34:49.750
<v Speaker 8>People have a knife there in that sort</v>
<v Speaker 8>of a situation.</v>

3302
02:34:49.751 --> 02:34:54.070
<v Speaker 8>People stab people out of fear.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Just trying to be the one who doesn't</v>

3303
02:34:54.071 --> 02:34:55.240
<v Speaker 8>get stabbed,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

3304
02:34:55.241 --> 02:34:57.370
<v Speaker 8>you think it's gonna it's eventually</v>
<v Speaker 8>going to get ugly.</v>

3305
02:34:58.200 --> 02:35:00.820
<v Speaker 8>Oof.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I had a situation with Joe Rogan,</v>

3306
02:35:00.821 --> 02:35:04.480
<v Speaker 8>I was so scared,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but it made sense what people say that</v>

3307
02:35:04.481 --> 02:35:08.320
<v Speaker 8>when sometimes it takes to get hit and</v>
<v Speaker 8>the fee it goes away.</v>

3308
02:35:09.290 --> 02:35:13.780
<v Speaker 8>Like my ex wife got some guy with my ex</v>
<v Speaker 8>with her boyfriend to jump me one time</v>

3309
02:35:14.530 --> 02:35:16.660
<v Speaker 8>and they hit the dog with a two by four</v>
<v Speaker 8>and I think,</v>

3310
02:35:16.740 --> 02:35:18.120
<v Speaker 8>oh wow,</v>
<v Speaker 8>that,</v>

3311
02:35:18.760 --> 02:35:20.920
<v Speaker 8>that they hit a,</v>
<v Speaker 8>his name was Hercules'.</v>

3312
02:35:20.921 --> 02:35:23.830
<v Speaker 8>They hit him with a,</v>
<v Speaker 8>with a two by four and when I ran</v>

3313
02:35:23.831 --> 02:35:26.440
<v Speaker 8>downstairs,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the guy hit me with a two by four but he</v>

3314
02:35:26.441 --> 02:35:30.310
<v Speaker 8>didn't really break my ribs.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I just felt something and I could still</v>

3315
02:35:30.311 --> 02:35:33.460
<v Speaker 8>swinging and stuff and I was really</v>
<v Speaker 8>scared and my heart was pumping.</v>

3316
02:35:33.461 --> 02:35:37.150
<v Speaker 8>But after I got my hands on him and the</v>
<v Speaker 8>pain went away,</v>

3317
02:35:37.420 --> 02:35:42.040
<v Speaker 8>like I was a different fucking person.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Like his buddy hit me from behind and he</v>

3318
02:35:42.041 --> 02:35:45.400
<v Speaker 8>tripped and he started running once I</v>
<v Speaker 8>took the first guy down and I was scared</v>

3319
02:35:45.401 --> 02:35:47.800
<v Speaker 8>shitless and the one guy was way bigger</v>
<v Speaker 8>than me,</v>

3320
02:35:48.280 --> 02:35:49.350
<v Speaker 8>but I got so pissed off.</v>

3321
02:35:49.350 --> 02:35:54.070
<v Speaker 8>Which one ran the guy with the stick?</v>
<v Speaker 8>The bigger guy or the littler?</v>

3322
02:35:54.160 --> 02:35:57.190
<v Speaker 8>The little guy,</v>
<v Speaker 8>he hit me with the stick and I don't</v>

3323
02:35:57.191 --> 02:35:59.950
<v Speaker 8>know what I did.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I didn't know about singles and doubles.</v>

3324
02:35:59.951 --> 02:36:00.820
<v Speaker 8>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 8>nothing about that.</v>

3325
02:36:00.821 --> 02:36:04.410
<v Speaker 8>I'm not going to want to know about it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I was just so hot that I tackled him and</v>

3326
02:36:04.480 --> 02:36:06.490
<v Speaker 8>I kept punching and punching him,</v>
<v Speaker 8>punching a bunch of,</v>

3327
02:36:07.060 --> 02:36:08.720
<v Speaker 8>and then I got away and I started</v>
<v Speaker 8>kicking him</v>

3328
02:36:10.270 --> 02:36:14.280
<v Speaker 8>and I just started stepping on him.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I started stepping on them dog.</v>

3329
02:36:14.500 --> 02:36:17.950
<v Speaker 8>I didn't know what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 8>He was making weird noises and I went</v>

3330
02:36:17.951 --> 02:36:20.650
<v Speaker 8>inside the house and I called the bolder</v>
<v Speaker 8>copper was off duty.</v>

3331
02:36:21.820 --> 02:36:25.530
<v Speaker 8>Who was a cool guy and I was prepared to</v>
<v Speaker 8>go to jail like I had no.</v>

3332
02:36:25.620 --> 02:36:27.730
<v Speaker 8>I knew I had Nigga.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I was still outside on the ground.</v>

3333
02:36:27.760 --> 02:36:28.870
<v Speaker 8>Guy was on the ground.</v>

3334
02:36:28.900 --> 02:36:30.970
<v Speaker 8>I fucked him up.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I stepped on his ankle.</v>

3335
02:36:31.780 --> 02:36:35.380
<v Speaker 8>I fucked up his foot,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know all that dirty shit.</v>

3336
02:36:35.381 --> 02:36:38.650
<v Speaker 8>I kicked him before I went to call.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I kicked him like three times in the</v>

3337
02:36:38.651 --> 02:36:42.550
<v Speaker 8>balls just to really keep him down.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Like I fucking kicked him with</v>

3338
02:36:42.551 --> 02:36:45.490
<v Speaker 8>everything I had because listen,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you want to hit me?</v>

3339
02:36:45.491 --> 02:36:47.860
<v Speaker 8>That's one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They hit the fucking dog.</v>

3340
02:36:47.890 --> 02:36:49.330
<v Speaker 8>You ain't going to hit a dog in front of</v>
<v Speaker 8>me.</v>

3341
02:36:50.180 --> 02:36:52.900
<v Speaker 8>Not In your fucking worst situate,</v>
<v Speaker 8>especially in my dog.</v>

3342
02:36:52.901 --> 02:36:55.240
<v Speaker 8>You're not going to have my dog two by</v>
<v Speaker 8>four.</v>

3343
02:36:55.420 --> 02:36:57.210
<v Speaker 8>And the other guy took off,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and I know,</v>

3344
02:36:57.211 --> 02:37:02.211
<v Speaker 8>I forget the guy's name was durfee and</v>
<v Speaker 8>he came and he was 400 pounds durfee</v>

3345
02:37:03.270 --> 02:37:06.730
<v Speaker 8>big,</v>
<v Speaker 8>those big fat cops or boulder cop never</v>

3346
02:37:06.731 --> 02:37:10.020
<v Speaker 8>got out of his car.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And I said,</v>

3347
02:37:10.030 --> 02:37:11.860
<v Speaker 8>durfee,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you don't call the cops.</v>

3348
02:37:12.100 --> 02:37:13.930
<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I protected myself.</v>

3349
02:37:13.990 --> 02:37:16.520
<v Speaker 8>I maybe went a little bit overboard,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

3350
02:37:17.420 --> 02:37:18.950
<v Speaker 8>and turfy goes,</v>
<v Speaker 8>call the cops.</v>

3351
02:37:18.980 --> 02:37:22.090
<v Speaker 8>This is beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Let's just wrap them up and dropping the</v>

3352
02:37:22.100 --> 02:37:26.450
<v Speaker 8>front of the hospital.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And I was always a pussy.</v>

3353
02:37:26.451 --> 02:37:28.490
<v Speaker 8>I was never scared that night.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Like at all.</v>

3354
02:37:28.491 --> 02:37:31.010
<v Speaker 8>I think once that,</v>
<v Speaker 8>that fucking two by four hit me,</v>

3355
02:37:31.011 --> 02:37:32.570
<v Speaker 8>whatever the fuck hit me in the side.</v>

3356
02:37:33.060 --> 02:37:35.670
<v Speaker 1>Well there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the anticipation of violence is almost</v>

3357
02:37:35.671 --> 02:37:39.510
<v Speaker 1>sometimes worse than the violence itself</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the anticipation that fight is</v>

3358
02:37:39.511 --> 02:37:41.700
<v Speaker 1>what everybody's terrified of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like what could happen?</v>

3359
02:37:41.701 --> 02:37:43.440
<v Speaker 1>The unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But once it's happening,</v>

3360
02:37:43.620 --> 02:37:46.250
<v Speaker 1>it's not the unknown anymore and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bright.</v>

3361
02:37:46.260 --> 02:37:47.310
<v Speaker 1>What's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going on,</v>

3362
02:37:47.580 --> 02:37:49.650
<v Speaker 1>what's going on right now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like in,</v>

3363
02:37:49.651 --> 02:37:50.970
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>competing.</v>

3364
02:37:52.140 --> 02:37:56.550
<v Speaker 1>Once a fight starts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't feel the same fear.</v>

3365
02:37:57.060 --> 02:38:00.930
<v Speaker 1>Like the real fear is the way in</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] before the fight,</v>

3366
02:38:01.360 --> 02:38:04.110
<v Speaker 1>like the announcements,</v>
<v Speaker 1>walking to the,</v>

3367
02:38:04.260 --> 02:38:06.420
<v Speaker 1>to the ring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>waiting in the locker room,</v>

3368
02:38:06.450 --> 02:38:07.680
<v Speaker 1>all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the real fear.</v>

3369
02:38:08.010 --> 02:38:09.690
<v Speaker 1>When you're there and you're actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting,</v>

3370
02:38:09.691 --> 02:38:11.260
<v Speaker 1>it's not a fear thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a,</v>

3371
02:38:11.520 --> 02:38:14.680
<v Speaker 1>you're so zoned into the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're so reactive.</v>

3372
02:38:15.510 --> 02:38:16.830
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine that's probably the same</v>

3373
02:38:16.831 --> 02:38:19.530
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that it's just like the fear of a</v>

3374
02:38:19.531 --> 02:38:22.980
<v Speaker 1>guy coming over and kicking your ass is</v>
<v Speaker 1>way worse than actually being in the</v>

3375
02:38:22.981 --> 02:38:24.650
<v Speaker 1>fight with the guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially if you know how to handle</v>

3376
02:38:24.651 --> 02:38:26.490
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like now it's,</v>

3377
02:38:26.491 --> 02:38:28.860
<v Speaker 1>I actually control something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something's going on here.</v>

3378
02:38:28.861 --> 02:38:31.260
<v Speaker 1>I can react.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can move around with something that's</v>

3379
02:38:31.261 --> 02:38:34.110
<v Speaker 1>actually going down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Guys get addicted to that too.</v>

3380
02:38:34.111 --> 02:38:34.920
<v Speaker 1>Boy,</v>

3381
02:38:34.920 --> 02:38:37.410
<v Speaker 8>I'm very surprised.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm not really,</v>

3382
02:38:37.411 --> 02:38:40.710
<v Speaker 8>really violent.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Like I'm really surprised.</v>

3383
02:38:40.711 --> 02:38:41.040
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>
<v Speaker 8>no,</v>

3384
02:38:41.040 --> 02:38:42.750
<v Speaker 8>no,</v>
<v Speaker 8>because they always blame shit on your</v>

3385
02:38:42.751 --> 02:38:45.540
<v Speaker 8>childhood.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They always attach things to your</v>

3386
02:38:45.541 --> 02:38:49.410
<v Speaker 8>childhood and I grew up around one of</v>
<v Speaker 8>the most violent people I haven't met in</v>

3387
02:38:49.411 --> 02:38:52.560
<v Speaker 8>my life.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That's why I know fear like I know what</v>

3388
02:38:52.561 --> 02:38:55.680
<v Speaker 8>fear is to be scared of somebody really</v>
<v Speaker 8>fucking great.</v>

3389
02:38:56.010 --> 02:39:00.390
<v Speaker 8>There's a difference between getting</v>
<v Speaker 8>smacked his Stepdad and his friends.</v>

3390
02:39:00.470 --> 02:39:05.130
<v Speaker 8>The people we hung out with and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 8>surprised I'm not more violent like I</v>

3391
02:39:05.131 --> 02:39:07.230
<v Speaker 8>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I don't shoot animals.</v>

3392
02:39:07.350 --> 02:39:08.190
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're smart guy.</v>

3393
02:39:08.191 --> 02:39:10.410
<v Speaker 1>You were well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would never do that.</v>

3394
02:39:10.680 --> 02:39:12.210
<v Speaker 1>You've always been an animal lover man,</v>

3395
02:39:12.930 --> 02:39:15.030
<v Speaker 8>but it's just weird that I didn't come</v>
<v Speaker 8>out with that.</v>

3396
02:39:15.031 --> 02:39:20.031
<v Speaker 8>Like I don't believe in a</v>
<v Speaker 8>stop though.</v>

3397
02:39:21.450 --> 02:39:24.630
<v Speaker 8>When did your violence stop because you</v>
<v Speaker 8>were still smacking people?</v>

3398
02:39:24.780 --> 02:39:26.010
<v Speaker 8>I don't know when,</v>
<v Speaker 8>Nah,</v>

3399
02:39:26.020 --> 02:39:29.880
<v Speaker 8>my violence stopped when I got beat up.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That's when that violin mentality,</v>

3400
02:39:29.881 --> 02:39:33.510
<v Speaker 8>when I realized that there's always</v>
<v Speaker 8>somebody out that's going to fuck you up</v>

3401
02:39:33.570 --> 02:39:36.900
<v Speaker 8>and now it's not like your mom.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's not a controlled beating.</v>

3402
02:39:36.990 --> 02:39:38.200
<v Speaker 8>It's real.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Somebody could,</v>

3403
02:39:38.460 --> 02:39:41.130
<v Speaker 8>you don't know what makes somebody</v>
<v Speaker 8>punched you three times in the head and</v>

3404
02:39:41.131 --> 02:39:41.670
<v Speaker 8>stop.</v>

3405
02:39:41.670 --> 02:39:44.850
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that interesting how that is like</v>
<v Speaker 1>the answer that everybody always has to</v>

3406
02:39:45.080 --> 02:39:47.190
<v Speaker 1>how many pussies they're out there that</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk so much shit.</v>

3407
02:39:47.460 --> 02:39:49.770
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a lot of people running</v>
<v Speaker 1>around the really need to get a fucking</v>

3408
02:39:49.771 --> 02:39:53.250
<v Speaker 1>punch in the face and people go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is a terrible way to think about</v>

3409
02:39:53.251 --> 02:39:55.050
<v Speaker 1>that is awful way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But no,</v>

3410
02:39:55.110 --> 02:39:58.170
<v Speaker 1>there's a humbling too that just like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that lady who was like,</v>

3411
02:39:58.171 --> 02:40:00.930
<v Speaker 1>thank you sir.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When she got fucked up by that elk,</v>

3412
02:40:01.140 --> 02:40:02.940
<v Speaker 1>you need to get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thank you sir.</v>

3413
02:40:02.960 --> 02:40:05.430
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you really need that in your life.</v>

3414
02:40:05.490 --> 02:40:08.040
<v Speaker 1>Like people need to get their fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>ass kicked man.</v>

3415
02:40:08.230 --> 02:40:11.490
<v Speaker 1>They don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they just run around thinking there's</v>

3416
02:40:11.491 --> 02:40:14.340
<v Speaker 1>no consequences to their actions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The living in his nerfed</v>

3417
02:40:14.340 --> 02:40:16.490
<v Speaker 5>environment,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the guy like you,</v>

3418
02:40:16.680 --> 02:40:19.230
<v Speaker 5>you see some dark shit going on and you</v>
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>

3419
02:40:19.470 --> 02:40:22.260
<v Speaker 5>you know there's consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You grew up with consequences,</v>

3420
02:40:22.550 --> 02:40:25.190
<v Speaker 5>heavy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>heavy going to the hospital believes</v>

3421
02:40:25.220 --> 02:40:28.140
<v Speaker 5>that's a consequence.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Unless you're always around drugs and</v>

3422
02:40:28.141 --> 02:40:33.030
<v Speaker 5>drug dealers and drug people and people</v>
<v Speaker 5>that are involved in illegal activity</v>

3423
02:40:33.031 --> 02:40:36.990
<v Speaker 5>where they have to protect their freedom</v>
<v Speaker 5>like drug dealers and being around drug</v>

3424
02:40:36.991 --> 02:40:41.100
<v Speaker 5>dealers like they're always one step</v>
<v Speaker 5>closer to violence than anybody else</v>

3425
02:40:41.101 --> 02:40:43.700
<v Speaker 5>around them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're always cause they are living a</v>

3426
02:40:43.770 --> 02:40:47.280
<v Speaker 5>dirty life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're living a life of complication</v>

3427
02:40:47.530 --> 02:40:50.250
<v Speaker 5>and and worry.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You always get to worry about someone</v>

3428
02:40:50.251 --> 02:40:52.020
<v Speaker 5>turning you in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He always got to worry about someone</v>

3429
02:40:52.021 --> 02:40:53.670
<v Speaker 5>getting arrested.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Where'd you get these drugs from?</v>

3430
02:40:53.700 --> 02:40:55.890
<v Speaker 5>Oh where does he live?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then boom,</v>

3431
02:40:56.190 --> 02:40:57.930
<v Speaker 5>you got to worry about people showing up</v>
<v Speaker 5>at your house.</v>

3432
02:40:57.931 --> 02:40:59.730
<v Speaker 5>You got a stash stuff in weird spots.</v>

3433
02:40:59.950 --> 02:41:04.500
<v Speaker 5>You got to always be on edge.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And once you add that drug to the mix,</v>

3434
02:41:04.530 --> 02:41:06.820
<v Speaker 5>like once you're dealing coke.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

3435
02:41:06.960 --> 02:41:08.880
<v Speaker 5>Like okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>take for example Pablo,</v>

3436
02:41:08.970 --> 02:41:10.140
<v Speaker 5>Pablo,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then snort cold.</v>

3437
02:41:10.620 --> 02:41:13.470
<v Speaker 5>He didn't do drugs but I find the movie</v>
<v Speaker 5>swung on a lot of weed.</v>

3438
02:41:13.471 --> 02:41:15.360
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did you do any coke?</v>

3439
02:41:15.420 --> 02:41:16.300
<v Speaker 5>No show.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

3440
02:41:16.480 --> 02:41:17.313
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's all.</v>

3441
02:41:17.400 --> 02:41:18.960
<v Speaker 5>I think you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Once you,</v>

3442
02:41:19.020 --> 02:41:23.940
<v Speaker 5>once you do coke as a dealer or heroin</v>
<v Speaker 5>or prescription pills,</v>

3443
02:41:24.270 --> 02:41:28.380
<v Speaker 5>that puts your judgment somewhere else.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When you do coke and you'd do coke for</v>

3444
02:41:28.381 --> 02:41:31.290
<v Speaker 5>three hours,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the high become something else that you</v>

3445
02:41:31.291 --> 02:41:32.790
<v Speaker 5>for.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It becomes paranoid,</v>

3446
02:41:32.920 --> 02:41:34.350
<v Speaker 5>right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and the more you do it,</v>

3447
02:41:34.351 --> 02:41:37.020
<v Speaker 5>the paranoia,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's shuts the window.</v>

3448
02:41:37.110 --> 02:41:42.000
<v Speaker 5>That euphoric state goes from three</v>
<v Speaker 5>hours to two hours to one hour to two</v>

3449
02:41:42.001 --> 02:41:43.960
<v Speaker 5>bumps,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like towards the FMA.</v>

3450
02:41:43.980 --> 02:41:45.270
<v Speaker 5>Two bumps.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was done.</v>

3451
02:41:45.540 --> 02:41:48.000
<v Speaker 5>Paranoid was high on the way home.</v>

3452
02:41:48.000 --> 02:41:53.000
<v Speaker 5>If I was driving and I saw a cop car</v>
<v Speaker 5>over there just watching speeders that</v>

3453
02:41:53.101 --> 02:41:55.710
<v Speaker 5>cop cars stayed in my mind and grew like</v>
<v Speaker 5>a weed.</v>

3454
02:41:56.250 --> 02:41:59.790
<v Speaker 5>Why was he there?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why that makes your trigger finger a lot</v>

3455
02:41:59.791 --> 02:42:03.030
<v Speaker 5>quicker?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That makes so many things a lot quicker.</v>

3456
02:42:03.240 --> 02:42:05.400
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I used to call the cops on myself.</v>

3457
02:42:05.430 --> 02:42:08.130
<v Speaker 5>That's not a junk,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's not a fucking joke.</v>

3458
02:42:08.490 --> 02:42:13.440
<v Speaker 5>That's a joke on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Where I originated from was in 1986 I</v>

3459
02:42:13.441 --> 02:42:17.160
<v Speaker 5>spent the weekend doing the best coconut</v>
<v Speaker 5>world and I kept calling the cops,</v>

3460
02:42:18.270 --> 02:42:20.070
<v Speaker 5>called the cops and they kept coming and</v>
<v Speaker 5>going,</v>

3461
02:42:20.071 --> 02:42:21.450
<v Speaker 5>what?</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a paragraph in the other room</v>

3462
02:42:21.840 --> 02:42:24.520
<v Speaker 5>and the time they go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>can we talk to you</v>

3463
02:42:26.160 --> 02:42:26.970
<v Speaker 5>and said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>listen,</v>

3464
02:42:26.970 --> 02:42:30.660
<v Speaker 5>how many lines have you done?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I haven't stopped him.</v>

3465

<v Speaker 5>Like we suggest you put away the bag.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

3466
02:42:32.761 --> 02:42:34.830

<v Speaker 5>The next Monday I had a walkthrough the</v>

3467
02:42:34.840 --> 02:42:37.050
<v Speaker 5>police station,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like when I have to a good 12 hours</v>

3468

<v Speaker 5>sleep.</v>

3469
02:42:37.320 --> 02:42:41.280
<v Speaker 5>And explained to them I wasn't doing</v>
<v Speaker 5>blow was just the reaction to the orange</v>

3470
02:42:41.281 --> 02:42:41.990
<v Speaker 5>juice.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they're like,</v>

<v Speaker 5>this happens all the time or period</v>

02:44:07.901 --> 02:44:08.320
<v Speaker 5>account.</v>

3506
02:44:08.320 --> 02:44:11.380
<v Speaker 5>Just had so much cash coming in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's actually pretty smart fabrics</v>

3507
02:44:11.390 --> 02:44:13.150
<v Speaker 5>where he would do so when he got blown</v>
<v Speaker 5>up,</v>

3508
02:44:13.151 --> 02:44:14.570
<v Speaker 5>you know who married his wife?</v>

3513
02:44:24.461 --> 02:44:28.600
<v Speaker 5>You're right.</v>

02:44:28.601 --> 02:44:32.590
<v Speaker 5>her mouth shut and it took some cash,</v>

<v Speaker 5>You would think so.</v>

3516
02:44:34.461 --> 02:44:37.000

<v Speaker 5>I've been asked the only fucking fire,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so the one's white people don't know how</v>

3532
02:45:17.981 --> 02:45:19.890

<v Speaker 5>time I did show up it was always a</v>

<v Speaker 5>Right there was on fire.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What am I going to leave the house and</v>

3543
02:45:41.711 --> 02:45:45.010

<v Speaker 5>Eight white people with sticks and the</v>

02:45:45.011 --> 02:45:50.011
<v Speaker 5>helmets were radios</v>
<v Speaker 5>over the fucking got a six third street.</v>

<v Speaker 5>They get in the mouth,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the mouth of the parrot,</v>

3546
02:45:56.921 --> 02:46:00.970
<v Speaker 5>the shit,</v>

02:46:03.941 --> 02:46:06.850

<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's 80 years idiots with things,</v>

<v Speaker 5>Call me for the big ones.</v>

3552
02:46:14.210 --> 02:46:16.010
<v Speaker 5>That's so fine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was never a big one,</v>

3553
02:46:16.070 --> 02:46:19.540
<v Speaker 5>so they fucking fine with me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's when they realized I was only in</v>

3554
02:46:19.541 --> 02:46:21.110
<v Speaker 5>it for the membership pass.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They said,</v>

<v Speaker 5>home for a long time.</v>

<v Speaker 5>But then there was a lot of hippies and</v>
<v Speaker 5>moved there in the 70s because they just</v>

3558
02:46:31.251 --> 02:46:35.120
<v Speaker 5>wanted to get out of society and they</v>
<v Speaker 5>somehow or another gravitated towards</v>

3587
02:47:51.261 --> 02:47:54.470
<v Speaker 5>where people usually go on the road and</v>

<v Speaker 5>would drive with them.</v>

3599
02:48:18.710 --> 02:48:20.600
<v Speaker 5>The weed would be in the trunk and the</v>
<v Speaker 5>garbage.</v>
