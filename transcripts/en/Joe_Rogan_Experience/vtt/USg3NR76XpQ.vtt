00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:06.240
<v Speaker 1>Two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>

2
00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:11.850
<v Speaker 1>boom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Welcome back.</v>

3
00:00:11.851 --> 00:00:13.410
<v Speaker 1>Ms Dot Peterson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

4
00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:15.240
<v Speaker 1>How are you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not too bad.</v>

5
00:00:15.241 --> 00:00:16.950
<v Speaker 1>How are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doing good man.</v>

6
00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.220
<v Speaker 1>You look like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

7
00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.310
<v Speaker 1>a man who was dealing with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>considerable amount of stress but is </v>

8
00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.310
<v Speaker 1>handling it well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

9
00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.620
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope that's true.</v>

10
00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.770
<v Speaker 1>I think the first part of it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope the second part is true.</v>

11
00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:33.860
<v Speaker 1>I read that you were denied a grant for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the first time in your history as an </v>

12
00:00:36.301 --> 00:00:37.890
<v Speaker 1>academic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

13
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.040
<v Speaker 1>And you think this is all based on your </v>
<v Speaker 1>outspoken and very public,</v>

14
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:48.120
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>denouncing the political correctness and</v>

15
00:00:48.121 --> 00:00:53.121
<v Speaker 1>have all this stuff that you've been </v>
<v Speaker 1>going through over the past more than a </v>

16
00:00:53.121 --> 00:00:56.931
<v Speaker 1>year now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know because I haven't got the </v>

17
00:00:56.931 --> 00:00:59.631
<v Speaker 1>full commentary on the grant yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I only found out that it was denied and </v>

18
00:00:59.631 --> 00:01:00.840
<v Speaker 1>it takes the granting agency a while to </v>
<v Speaker 1>send out the full report.</v>

19
00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.320
<v Speaker 1>I've heard from other people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know some other people who I would </v>

20
00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.780
<v Speaker 1>consider relatively high profile </v>
<v Speaker 1>researchers.</v>

21
00:01:06.781 --> 00:01:08.910
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>walls also didn't get funded this round.</v>

22
00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.420
<v Speaker 1>So there might be multiple reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I can't help suspect that the fact </v>

23
00:01:14.911 --> 00:01:19.911
<v Speaker 1>that the grant application concentrated </v>
<v Speaker 1>on delineating the personality </v>

24
00:01:19.911 --> 00:01:22.350
<v Speaker 1>characteristics of politically correct </v>
<v Speaker 1>belief might've had something to do with</v>

25
00:01:22.351 --> 00:01:25.380
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So still a taboo subject.</v>

26
00:01:25.381 --> 00:01:30.381
<v Speaker 1>It's fascinating that thinking and </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking and pondering and examining </v>

27
00:01:31.291 --> 00:01:34.080
<v Speaker 1>certain types of behavior would still be</v>
<v Speaker 1>a taboo subject.</v>

28
00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:35.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is Amazing.</v>

29
00:01:35.401 --> 00:01:37.530
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And becoming more taboo all the time.</v>

30
00:01:37.531 --> 00:01:41.370
<v Speaker 1>I would say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think the universities are have.</v>

31
00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.150
<v Speaker 1>I think they're getting worse still and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it will be awhile before they get </v>

32
00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:47.150
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't say that.</v>

33
00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:51.321
<v Speaker 1>So globally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but certainly the case with the </v>

34
00:01:51.321 --> 00:01:51.321
<v Speaker 1>humanities and much of the social </v>
<v Speaker 1>sciences,</v>

35
00:01:51.321 --> 00:01:55.570
<v Speaker 1>but it seems globally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean not necessarily in terms of all </v>

36
00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:59.271
<v Speaker 1>the different subjects but certainly in </v>
<v Speaker 1>terms of what you teach and what your </v>

37
00:01:59.271 --> 00:02:02.290
<v Speaker 1>involved in and it just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so</v>

38
00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:04.730
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hate to use the word,</v>

39
00:02:04.731 --> 00:02:09.731
<v Speaker 1>but it's so regressive to put </v>
<v Speaker 1>restrictions on the examining of </v>

40
00:02:10.581 --> 00:02:14.000
<v Speaker 1>thinking in a university.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's kind of crazy.</v>

41
00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:19.150
<v Speaker 1>I mean what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you went through in one of your </v>

42
00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.680
<v Speaker 1>most recent public speeches where they </v>
<v Speaker 1>allowed these kids to be in the room </v>

43
00:02:25.311 --> 00:02:28.670
<v Speaker 1>with you with bullhorns and they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>screaming event Jamie,</v>

44
00:02:28.671 --> 00:02:30.500
<v Speaker 1>see if he could find the video that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was the name?</v>

45
00:02:30.501 --> 00:02:32.570
<v Speaker 1>Master master.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Master University.</v>

46
00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you were giving your speech and </v>

47
00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.620
<v Speaker 1>there was supposed to be some other </v>
<v Speaker 1>people involved.</v>

48
00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.310
<v Speaker 1>They backed out and you decided to </v>
<v Speaker 1>continue on,</v>

49
00:02:40.311 --> 00:02:43.340
<v Speaker 1>so you're standing there in front of </v>
<v Speaker 1>these people that were there to hear you</v>

50
00:02:43.341 --> 00:02:48.341
<v Speaker 1>talk and there's a group of kids with </v>
<v Speaker 1>bull horns like literally and shouting </v>

51
00:02:48.921 --> 00:02:51.950
<v Speaker 1>and yelling and chanting with signs in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the room,</v>

52
00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.740
<v Speaker 1>just completely disrupting what you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>

53
00:02:54.741 --> 00:02:57.680
<v Speaker 1>And they allowed this all to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Airhorns as well.</v>

54
00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.800
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

55
00:02:58.801 --> 00:03:00.040
<v Speaker 1>And they blowing air horns quite</v>

56
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.610
<v Speaker 2>close.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To me.</v>

57
00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.940
<v Speaker 2>That was the one thing I really objected</v>
<v Speaker 2>to because airhorns actually happened to</v>

58
00:03:03.941 --> 00:03:04.720
<v Speaker 2>be quite loud.</v>

59
00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.650
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

60
00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.280
<v Speaker 3>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's actually an assault on your ears.</v>

61
00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.580
<v Speaker 3>It's very bad for your hearing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you're not supposed to be in a room</v>

62
00:03:11.581 --> 00:03:16.581
<v Speaker 3>with those without hearing protection.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're supposed to be like for like </v>

63
00:03:16.581 --> 00:03:17.910
<v Speaker 3>scary things like play some of this </v>
<v Speaker 3>Jamie so we can hear how crazy.</v>

64
00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:18.860
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

65
00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.350
<v Speaker 3>Yelling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shut him down.</v>

66
00:03:31.351 --> 00:03:36.351
<v Speaker 3>No freedom for hate speech and the hate </v>
<v Speaker 3>speech thing has like prince symbol meet</v>

67
00:03:40.161 --> 00:03:45.161
<v Speaker 3>some sort of Martian language.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what the fuck is that that they </v>

68
00:03:45.161 --> 00:03:46.530
<v Speaker 3>have on that note?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No freedom for hate speech.</v>

69
00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:50.510
<v Speaker 2>I guess it's a poly gender,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a symbol of some sort.</v>

70
00:03:50.511 --> 00:03:54.230
<v Speaker 2>There's a fist in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that was really not so</v>

71
00:03:54.231 --> 00:03:59.231
<v Speaker 2>good about all of that was that a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people who were protesting were </v>

72
00:03:59.231 --> 00:04:01.220
<v Speaker 2>standing behind a hammer and sickle </v>
<v Speaker 2>banner,</v>

73
00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:06.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which just absolutely amazes me because </v>

74
00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:06.950
<v Speaker 2>I still haven't been able to quite </v>
<v Speaker 2>figure this out.</v>

75
00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:10.310
<v Speaker 2>I can't figure out why you couldn't do </v>
<v Speaker 2>that with a Nazi symbol,</v>

76
00:04:10.311 --> 00:04:12.470
<v Speaker 2>but you can do that with a hammer and </v>
<v Speaker 2>sickle,</v>

77
00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:14.540
<v Speaker 2>you know it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a reason.</v>

78
00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:18.620
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's because the Nazi doctrine was</v>
<v Speaker 2>so explicitly racist,</v>

79
00:04:18.621 --> 00:04:23.621
<v Speaker 2>but God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not like the hammer and sickle </v>

80
00:04:23.621 --> 00:04:26.291
<v Speaker 2>wasn't equally murderous or be actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>quite profoundly more murderous as it </v>

81
00:04:26.291 --> 00:04:27.780
<v Speaker 2>turned out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So and I how,</v>

82
00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:29.510
<v Speaker 2>how people can not steal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

83
00:04:29.511 --> 00:04:32.000
<v Speaker 2>that is beyond me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

84
00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:37.060
<v Speaker 2>and to rally behind a banner like that </v>
<v Speaker 2>without realizing what they're doing or </v>

85
00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:41.800
<v Speaker 2>even worse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>realizing it and still organizing </v>

86
00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.220
<v Speaker 2>themselves behind it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>explained about hate speech.</v>

87
00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:45.650
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no real communicating with,</v>

88
00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:48.740
<v Speaker 2>with people who are demonstrating that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're in a kind of trance,</v>

89
00:04:48.741 --> 00:04:53.741
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I went up to try to talk to you a </v>

90
00:04:53.741 --> 00:04:56.231
<v Speaker 2>couple of them and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when you look at people who are in </v>

91
00:04:56.241 --> 00:05:01.241
<v Speaker 2>that state of mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not looking at you as if you're </v>

92
00:05:01.241 --> 00:05:01.241
<v Speaker 2>a human being,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

93
00:05:01.241 --> 00:05:05.441
<v Speaker 2>you're the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're the target of their </v>

94
00:05:05.441 --> 00:05:07.240
<v Speaker 2>conceptualizations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're the realization of their </v>

95
00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.211
<v Speaker 2>conceptualizations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course they didn't listen to </v>

96
00:05:10.211 --> 00:05:10.211
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

97
00:05:10.211 --> 00:05:10.880
<v Speaker 2>well hardly anyone did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Although I got to talk outside because I</v>

98
00:05:10.881 --> 00:05:14.090
<v Speaker 2>took everybody outside and then spoke </v>
<v Speaker 2>out there for awhile.</v>

99
00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:17.120
<v Speaker 2>And when you were outside with his still</v>
<v Speaker 2>yelling and bull horns.</v>

100
00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:23.020
<v Speaker 2>But what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went outside and I stood on a couple </v>

101
00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:26.260
<v Speaker 2>of benches so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the people that wanted to hear kind </v>

102
00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.580
<v Speaker 2>of made a circle around me and that more</v>
<v Speaker 2>or less by chance pushed all the </v>

103
00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:34.271
<v Speaker 2>protesters to the back so they could so </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I could address the people that </v>

104
00:05:34.271 --> 00:05:36.890
<v Speaker 2>actually wanted me to actually want it </v>
<v Speaker 2>to listen to what I was saying.</v>

105
00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:42.040
<v Speaker 3>And so did you have a dialogue with them</v>
<v Speaker 3>or did you give a speech and how did </v>

106
00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:42.040
<v Speaker 3>that work?</v>

107
00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:44.070
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have a dialogue at all with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>protesters.</v>

108
00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:45.700
<v Speaker 2>I mean with the people that came to see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

109
00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:46.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that worked out okay.</v>

110
00:05:46.741 --> 00:05:51.741
<v Speaker 2>Once I got outside and I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I wasn't particularly upset with </v>

111
00:05:51.741 --> 00:05:54.000
<v Speaker 2>the fact that the protesters had showed </v>
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>

112
00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:58.040
<v Speaker 2>I mean practically speaking because I'm</v>

113
00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:01.400
<v Speaker 5>in this peculiar situation where if the </v>
<v Speaker 5>protest is show up,</v>

114
00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:02.930
<v Speaker 5>that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And if they don't show up,</v>

115
00:06:02.931 --> 00:06:06.500
<v Speaker 5>that's good too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's good if they show up because I have</v>

116
00:06:06.501 --> 00:06:09.020
<v Speaker 5>access to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to a youtube audience obviously.</v>

117
00:06:09.021 --> 00:06:12.700
<v Speaker 5>And then it gets filmed and the films </v>
<v Speaker 5>get put together and that get puts,</v>

118
00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:14.930
<v Speaker 5>that gets put online.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And generally speaking,</v>

119
00:06:14.931 --> 00:06:17.180
<v Speaker 5>when the social justice types have come </v>
<v Speaker 5>after me,</v>

120
00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:22.450
<v Speaker 5>they've done a pretty admirable job of </v>
<v Speaker 5>discrediting themselves and so that </v>

121
00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:26.681
<v Speaker 5>seems to be all to the good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then if they let me speak well then </v>

122
00:06:26.681 --> 00:06:26.681
<v Speaker 5>I get to speak and I can put that on </v>
<v Speaker 5>youtube.</v>

123
00:06:26.681 --> 00:06:31.481
<v Speaker 5>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a very strange situation for me </v>

124
00:06:31.481 --> 00:06:32.900
<v Speaker 5>because as long as I don't do anything </v>
<v Speaker 5>too stupid or anything,</v>

125
00:06:32.901 --> 00:06:36.710
<v Speaker 5>any stupider than I have done,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's say I seem to come out okay.</v>

126
00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:41.950
<v Speaker 5>And like I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm certainly not counting on that </v>

127
00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:43.290
<v Speaker 5>continuing and I'm not a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>

128
00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:47.390
<v Speaker 5>I'm surprised by it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But so far it seems to be working out.</v>

129
00:06:47.391 --> 00:06:50.410
<v Speaker 5>So you know Perrey.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

130
00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:55.570
<v Speaker 3>The way you handled it is admirable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The way you kept your cool and just </v>

131
00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:57.830
<v Speaker 3>continued talking and didn't flip out </v>
<v Speaker 3>and didn't,</v>

132
00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:01.580
<v Speaker 3>didn't give in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't succumb to the provocation.</v>

133
00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:04.880
<v Speaker 3>It's because they were obviously </v>
<v Speaker 3>provoking you and they are obviously.</v>

134
00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:08.270
<v Speaker 3>I just don't understand how the </v>
<v Speaker 3>university allows them to do that.</v>

135
00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:10.280
<v Speaker 3>How they allow them to be in that room,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

136
00:07:10.281 --> 00:07:13.190
<v Speaker 3>with those air horns,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which are really bad for anybody in that</v>

137
00:07:13.191 --> 00:07:14.510
<v Speaker 3>room.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who's near them?</v>

138
00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:16.580
<v Speaker 3>It causes hearing damage.</v>

139
00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:17.040
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

140
00:07:17.041 --> 00:07:21.220
<v Speaker 5>in the one person who is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who is Air Horn me was really quite a,</v>

141
00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:24.690
<v Speaker 5>I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's say forward about it,</v>

142
00:07:24.691 --> 00:07:27.210
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they were coming close enough to me to,</v>

143
00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:30.600
<v Speaker 5>to do some damage and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

144
00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:31.570
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>

145
00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:32.270
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

146
00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:37.700
<v Speaker 5>I have seen the odd person at those </v>
<v Speaker 5>rallies that really isn't well put </v>

147
00:07:37.921 --> 00:07:38.910
<v Speaker 5>together,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

148
00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:41.360
<v Speaker 5>people I look in their eyes and I think </v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

149
00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:41.960
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're,</v>

150
00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:47.490
<v Speaker 5>you're definitely here for the wrong </v>
<v Speaker 5>reasons and I think it's more </v>

151
00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:49.110
<v Speaker 5>characteristic often to the guys that I </v>
<v Speaker 5>see at the events rather than the women.</v>

152
00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:50.340
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not sure about that.</v>

153
00:07:50.341 --> 00:07:52.560
<v Speaker 5>I'm obviously speculating,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you know,</v>

154
00:07:52.590 --> 00:07:57.590
<v Speaker 5>I have a reasonably good clinical </v>
<v Speaker 5>intuition and some of the guys I see at </v>

155
00:07:57.590 --> 00:07:58.740
<v Speaker 5>those events there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what their story is,</v>

156
00:07:58.741 --> 00:08:00.090
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what they're up to.</v>

157
00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:02.280
<v Speaker 5>I guess they're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what are they trying to do?</v>

158
00:08:02.281 --> 00:08:05.880
<v Speaker 5>Be Allies of the women for their own </v>
<v Speaker 5>nefarious purposes.</v>

159
00:08:05.881 --> 00:08:07.380
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's what it looks like to me,</v>

160
00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:08.080
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

161
00:08:08.081 --> 00:08:10.170
<v Speaker 3>there's certainly an issue with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>

162
00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:15.230
<v Speaker 3>it's a common thread with men,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially in the male feminists </v>

163
00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:19.191
<v Speaker 3>category that they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they align themselves with these women </v>

164
00:08:19.191 --> 00:08:20.320
<v Speaker 3>as allies and as this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

165
00:08:20.321 --> 00:08:25.321
<v Speaker 3>they take this moral high ground and </v>
<v Speaker 3>there this person that's going to show </v>

166
00:08:25.321 --> 00:08:29.010
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>other men how to do feminism and how to </v>

167
00:08:29.010 --> 00:08:31.060
<v Speaker 3>behave with women and they're really </v>
<v Speaker 3>just sort of,</v>

168
00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:35.830
<v Speaker 3>they're mining the situations for social</v>
<v Speaker 3>points,</v>

169
00:08:36.510 --> 00:08:38.730
<v Speaker 3>for social sexual points.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My sexual.</v>

170
00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:39.330
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>

171
00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:41.530
<v Speaker 5>There's something seriously creepy about</v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

172
00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:46.570
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I saw too that that guy at the Berkeley,</v>

173
00:08:46.770 --> 00:08:51.770
<v Speaker 5>the reason Berkeley demonstration,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the guy who hit someone with a bike lock</v>

174
00:08:53.850 --> 00:08:56.220
<v Speaker 5>bag and he was hiding behind women and </v>
<v Speaker 5>then he darted</v>

175
00:08:56.220 --> 00:09:01.220
<v Speaker 1>out and just nailed the guy with a bike </v>
<v Speaker 1>law with what turned out to be a bike </v>

176
00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:01.820
<v Speaker 1>law guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just hanging there talk to you.</v>

177
00:09:01.821 --> 00:09:03.990
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't being violent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't doing anything.</v>

178
00:09:03.991 --> 00:09:05.880
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that guy turned out to be a professor.</v>

179
00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:07.140
<v Speaker 1>They found that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

180
00:09:07.141 --> 00:09:09.000
<v Speaker 1>And so has that been verified?</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of that.</v>

181
00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:12.660
<v Speaker 1>There's photographs of him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's photographs of his face.</v>

182
00:09:12.661 --> 00:09:15.130
<v Speaker 1>They compared the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his eyes to the professors.</v>

183
00:09:15.131 --> 00:09:20.131
<v Speaker 1>Are they know that the guy was there and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the guy will aligns himself with </v>

184
00:09:20.131 --> 00:09:24.081
<v Speaker 1>Marxism and he's just like a communist </v>
<v Speaker 1>slash socialist professor who's very </v>

185
00:09:25.351 --> 00:09:30.351
<v Speaker 1>adamantly against a right wing ideology </v>
<v Speaker 1>and this kind of Shit.</v>

186
00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:34.590
<v Speaker 1>So He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure that that's the guy.</v>

187
00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:35.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

188
00:09:35.161 --> 00:09:37.260
<v Speaker 1>Well I kind of followed that and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>noticed that.</v>

189
00:09:37.261 --> 00:09:39.240
<v Speaker 1>I mean for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as far as I'm concerned,</v>

190
00:09:39.570 --> 00:09:42.390
<v Speaker 1>watching what he did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the true face of those people.</v>

191
00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:47.450
<v Speaker 1>It's assault.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he hit a guy with a deadly </v>

192
00:09:47.450 --> 00:09:47.450
<v Speaker 1>weapon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

193
00:09:47.450 --> 00:09:49.080
<v Speaker 1>I mean I also thought it was blackly </v>
<v Speaker 1>comic that it was a bike lock.</v>

194
00:09:49.081 --> 00:09:51.370
<v Speaker 1>I mean that just figures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know so.</v>

195
00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:57.440
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just the idea that you could just </v>

196
00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:59.120
<v Speaker 1>walk up to someone you don't like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way they think and hit them in the head </v>

197
00:09:59.120 --> 00:09:59.120
<v Speaker 1>with a metal thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just so.</v>

198
00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:03.890
<v Speaker 1>It's so crazy and so delusional and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>indicative of someone who looks at a </v>

199
00:10:03.890 --> 00:10:08.841
<v Speaker 1>person as the other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not looking at it as a human </v>

200
00:10:08.841 --> 00:10:09.600
<v Speaker 1>being or disagrees with you like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And not only that,</v>

201
00:10:09.601 --> 00:10:12.570
<v Speaker 1>a young human being talk about a lack of</v>
<v Speaker 1>empathy.</v>

202
00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:15.150
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're expecting this 20 year old guy or</v>

203
00:10:15.151 --> 00:10:16.980
<v Speaker 1>however old the guy wasn't get hit in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the head.</v>

204
00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:22.160
<v Speaker 1>You're expecting him to have his </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideology down solid and not be </v>

205
00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:23.370
<v Speaker 1>influenced by peers or not.</v>

206
00:10:23.370 --> 00:10:28.370
<v Speaker 1>Be Curious about what this argument is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the guy wasn't even yelling </v>

207
00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:28.370
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was just standing there.</v>

208
00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:33.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's Kinda what I thought about </v>

209
00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:33.350
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The protesters at mcmaster too,</v>

210
00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:33.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's partly,</v>

211
00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:37.800
<v Speaker 1>I don't get upset.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like I look at these kids that are </v>

212
00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:37.800
<v Speaker 1>out there protesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

213
00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:40.350
<v Speaker 1>apart from the professional professional</v>
<v Speaker 1>protestor types and I think,</v>

214
00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:45.380
<v Speaker 1>well Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've been served so badly by the </v>

215
00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:45.380
<v Speaker 1>education system that it's absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 1>beyond belief.</v>

216
00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:50.270
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're basically being sent out as </v>

217
00:10:50.270 --> 00:10:52.461
<v Speaker 1>avatars have this pathological </v>
<v Speaker 1>postmodern movement by their professors </v>

218
00:10:52.461 --> 00:10:54.270
<v Speaker 1>who are themselves too cowardly to show </v>
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

219
00:10:54.271 --> 00:10:58.490
<v Speaker 1>Generally speaking certainly aren't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't brave enough to debate me because</v>

220
00:10:58.530 --> 00:11:03.530
<v Speaker 1>they do show up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like this guy with a mask on </v>

221
00:11:03.530 --> 00:11:03.530
<v Speaker 1>hitting people in the head who was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>professor.</v>

222
00:11:03.530 --> 00:11:04.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well they don't believe in dialogue.</v>

223
00:11:04.381 --> 00:11:05.480
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not part of their.</v>

224
00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:10.900
<v Speaker 1>It's not part of the postmodern ethos to</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a dialogue with people you don't </v>

225
00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:14.361
<v Speaker 1>agree with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you weren't able to talk to anyone </v>

226
00:11:14.361 --> 00:11:14.370
<v Speaker 1>that opposed you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not so far.</v>

227
00:11:14.371 --> 00:11:17.490
<v Speaker 1>Not In any serious sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Were you able to talk to anyone that had</v>

228
00:11:17.491 --> 00:11:20.310
<v Speaker 1>the hammer and sickle sign and and ask </v>
<v Speaker 1>them like,</v>

229
00:11:20.311 --> 00:11:23.790
<v Speaker 1>do you understand what this stands for?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does this mean to you?</v>

230
00:11:23.791 --> 00:11:24.570
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

231
00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:27.100
<v Speaker 1>What are you trying to project by having</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sun?</v>

232
00:11:27.410 --> 00:11:28.070
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

233
00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:30.090
<v Speaker 1>wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't possible at that venue.</v>

234
00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:30.990
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>

235
00:11:30.991 --> 00:11:34.290
<v Speaker 1>whenever I got close to anybody that was</v>
<v Speaker 1>protesting that it,</v>

236
00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:36.900
<v Speaker 1>there was no one to one human </v>
<v Speaker 1>interaction,</v>

237
00:11:36.930 --> 00:11:41.930
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I can tell when someone's going </v>

238
00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:43.800
<v Speaker 1>to be willing to communicate with me and</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they've kind of got cold eyes,</v>

239
00:11:43.801 --> 00:11:45.220
<v Speaker 1>like a cod fish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

240
00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:50.630
<v Speaker 1>whatever they're looking at has nothing </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do with me or very little to do with </v>

241
00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:50.630
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

242
00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:54.800
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that seems to me to be one of the </v>

243
00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:55.940
<v Speaker 1>weirder aspects of this thing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going through this,</v>

244
00:11:56.100 --> 00:11:57.910
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

245
00:11:57.911 --> 00:12:02.911
<v Speaker 1>all these series of altercations that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going through is the lack of </v>

246
00:12:02.911 --> 00:12:07.231
<v Speaker 1>discourse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there was this one that you went on </v>

247
00:12:07.231 --> 00:12:07.990
<v Speaker 1>to on television when we talked about </v>
<v Speaker 1>the last time you were here with.</v>

248
00:12:07.991 --> 00:12:12.991
<v Speaker 1>It's very bizarre and drudging this </v>
<v Speaker 1>person that was saying there's no </v>

249
00:12:12.991 --> 00:12:15.070
<v Speaker 1>gender,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is no biological basis for gender,</v>

250
00:12:15.071 --> 00:12:20.071
<v Speaker 1>which is just complete insanity and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>shooting that down and might be </v>

251
00:12:20.071 --> 00:12:24.511
<v Speaker 1>insanity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's Canadian law now or soon to be </v>

252
00:12:24.511 --> 00:12:25.480
<v Speaker 1>federally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's insanity for sure.</v>

253
00:12:25.481 --> 00:12:30.481
<v Speaker 1>But.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's the kind of insanity that's </v>

254
00:12:30.481 --> 00:12:32.671
<v Speaker 1>going to have legal force very soon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is it specifically that there's no </v>

255
00:12:33.191 --> 00:12:33.880
<v Speaker 1>seat?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

256
00:12:34.030 --> 00:12:39.030
<v Speaker 1>with Bill [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was the bill that I was </v>

257
00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:41.251
<v Speaker 1>complaining about or criticizing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say there's a variety of </v>

258
00:12:41.251 --> 00:12:46.201
<v Speaker 1>surrounding policy documents that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>derived from the Ontario Human Rights </v>

259
00:12:46.201 --> 00:12:48.310
<v Speaker 1>Commission and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they indicate quite clearly that year to</v>

260
00:12:48.311 --> 00:12:51.490
<v Speaker 1>regard biological sex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gender identity,</v>

261
00:12:51.491 --> 00:12:55.570
<v Speaker 1>gender expression and sexual proclivity </v>
<v Speaker 1>as varying independently.</v>

262
00:12:56.050 --> 00:12:59.200
<v Speaker 1>Which of course they don't by any </v>
<v Speaker 1>stretch of the imagination.</v>

263
00:12:59.201 --> 00:13:04.201
<v Speaker 1>They're so tightly correlated that well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't use correlation to imply cause</v>

264
00:13:04.570 --> 00:13:06.820
<v Speaker 1>or to infer causality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But Jesus,</v>

265
00:13:06.821 --> 00:13:09.550
<v Speaker 1>when the correlations are above point </v>
<v Speaker 1>nine five,</v>

266
00:13:09.551 --> 00:13:14.551
<v Speaker 1>you have to start wondering if there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually not some causal link and it's </v>

267
00:13:14.551 --> 00:13:16.300
<v Speaker 1>absurd to me that we really even have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>have that discussion.</v>

268
00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:21.870
<v Speaker 1>But the notion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is being taught to schoolkids </v>

269
00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:21.870
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this isn't,</v>

270
00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:24.370
<v Speaker 1>this is mainstream doctrine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe The gender.</v>

271
00:13:24.390 --> 00:13:27.250
<v Speaker 1>Look up the gender Unicorn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a fun thing to look up.</v>

272
00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:32.350
<v Speaker 1>What is the Gender Unicorn?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Gender Unicorn is this little happy </v>

273
00:13:32.350 --> 00:13:33.700
<v Speaker 1>symbol that's being marketed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>children,</v>

274
00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:36.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in elementary school,</v>

275
00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:41.310
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>describing to them the fact that </v>

276
00:13:41.310 --> 00:13:41.310
<v Speaker 1>biological sex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gender identity,</v>

277
00:13:41.310 --> 00:13:43.810
<v Speaker 1>gender expression and sexual proclivity </v>
<v Speaker 1>very independently,</v>

278
00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:47.230
<v Speaker 1>they're going after them very young.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's part of the,</v>

279
00:13:47.250 --> 00:13:49.420
<v Speaker 1>that's part of the school system now in </v>
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>

280
00:13:49.421 --> 00:13:50.140
<v Speaker 1>many places.</v>

281
00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:52.390
<v Speaker 1>So in many ways it's sort of an </v>
<v Speaker 1>indoctrination.</v>

282
00:13:52.430 --> 00:13:55.570
<v Speaker 1>They're trying to say that the gender </v>
<v Speaker 1>Unicorn,</v>

283
00:13:55.810 --> 00:13:57.700
<v Speaker 1>a Unicorn man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>check that thing out.</v>

284
00:13:57.760 --> 00:13:59.830
<v Speaker 1>Gender identity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>female woman,</v>

285
00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:01.120
<v Speaker 1>girl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>male man,</v>

286
00:14:01.150 --> 00:14:02.080
<v Speaker 1>boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>other gender,</v>

287
00:14:02.081 --> 00:14:03.760
<v Speaker 1>gender expression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>feminine,</v>

288
00:14:03.761 --> 00:14:06.220
<v Speaker 1>Masculine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Other sex assigned at birth,</v>

289
00:14:06.250 --> 00:14:07.420
<v Speaker 1>female,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Male,</v>

290
00:14:07.810 --> 00:14:09.960
<v Speaker 1>other intersex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

291
00:14:10.030 --> 00:14:13.240
<v Speaker 1>like aliens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>physically attracted to men,</v>

292
00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:14.650
<v Speaker 1>women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>other,</v>

293
00:14:15.250 --> 00:14:20.250
<v Speaker 1>other gender s emotionally attracted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what you do if you're a kid is you </v>

294
00:14:20.621 --> 00:14:25.621
<v Speaker 1>put a little marker there on the Arrow </v>
<v Speaker 1>to show where you're located on all </v>

295
00:14:25.621 --> 00:14:28.000
<v Speaker 1>those independent dimensions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And obviously if you look at the,</v>

296
00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:32.560
<v Speaker 1>at the style of the Gender Unicorn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can tell what sort of age it's aimed</v>

297
00:14:32.561 --> 00:14:34.150
<v Speaker 1>at [inaudible] that looks like it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>aimed for.</v>

298
00:14:34.270 --> 00:14:37.570
<v Speaker 1>Certainly not aimed at kids over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say 10.</v>

299
00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:42.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why does the Gender Unicorn have a </v>

300
00:14:42.750 --> 00:14:42.970
<v Speaker 1>double helix DNA symbol where it's penis</v>
<v Speaker 1>or vagina.</v>

301
00:14:42.971 --> 00:14:45.530
<v Speaker 1>So should they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's to indicate that there's no law.</v>

302
00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:48.220
<v Speaker 1>There's no such thing as biology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I presume,</v>

303
00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:53.760
<v Speaker 1>but why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how ironic might say so yeah,</v>

304
00:14:54.220 --> 00:14:57.620
<v Speaker 1>it's a weird place to put it over the </v>
<v Speaker 1>crotch of the UNICORNS.</v>

305
00:14:58.170 --> 00:15:03.170
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an indefinite number of weird </v>

306
00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:03.170
<v Speaker 1>things about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yes,</v>

307
00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:05.530
<v Speaker 1>there's the ginger ginger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gender bread person that's A.</v>

308
00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:09.500
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>genderbread person has a male symbol,</v>

309
00:15:09.501 --> 00:15:11.320
<v Speaker 1>female symbol.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then uh,</v>

310
00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:15.810
<v Speaker 1>what am I all together with a circle </v>
<v Speaker 1>where the,</v>

311
00:15:16.070 --> 00:15:18.680
<v Speaker 1>a whole not a whole circle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So strange,</v>

312
00:15:19.370 --> 00:15:22.430
<v Speaker 1>problematic place for the circle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say very assumptive.</v>

313
00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:23.690
<v Speaker 1>I would say so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

314
00:15:23.691 --> 00:15:25.430
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like that at all.</v>

315
00:15:25.490 --> 00:15:27.020
<v Speaker 1>I feel triggered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

316
00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:32.320
<v Speaker 1>the whole thing is it's so bizarre,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what's even more bizarre is the lack</v>

317
00:15:33.081 --> 00:15:38.081
<v Speaker 1>of dialogue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like you're in a weird position </v>

318
00:15:38.081 --> 00:15:42.070
<v Speaker 1>where there's a tremendous amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>support for you outside of the academic </v>

319
00:15:42.651 --> 00:15:44.630
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People like me,</v>

320
00:15:44.631 --> 00:15:47.480
<v Speaker 1>people like so many people that support </v>
<v Speaker 1>your youtube videos,</v>

321
00:15:47.481 --> 00:15:52.481
<v Speaker 1>so many people that read about you </v>
<v Speaker 1>online and you're experiencing all this </v>

322
00:15:52.481 --> 00:15:55.280
<v Speaker 1>backlash at like mcmasters and these </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of things,</v>

323
00:15:55.490 --> 00:15:58.660
<v Speaker 1>but there's people are not engaging you </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the way they are,</v>

324
00:15:58.690 --> 00:16:00.050
<v Speaker 1>they're keeping from engaging.</v>

325
00:16:00.050 --> 00:16:03.620
<v Speaker 1>You is saying that you are demonstrating</v>
<v Speaker 1>hate speech,</v>

326
00:16:04.910 --> 00:16:06.530
<v Speaker 1>hate speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's racism.</v>

327
00:16:06.531 --> 00:16:09.740
<v Speaker 1>The reason I'd be called a racist is </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I complained.</v>

328
00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:14.980
<v Speaker 1>I criticized the University of Toronto's</v>
<v Speaker 1>decision to use the Toronto chapter of </v>

329
00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:19.781
<v Speaker 1>black lives matter as policy advisers </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the reason I did that was because </v>

330
00:16:19.781 --> 00:16:22.040
<v Speaker 1>the two women who founded black lives </v>
<v Speaker 1>matter in Toronto,</v>

331
00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:28.560
<v Speaker 1>let's say they have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say they have questionable </v>

332
00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:31.961
<v Speaker 1>reputations and leave it at that and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>apparently that makes me racist because.</v>

333
00:16:32.690 --> 00:16:37.690
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't question them because they're </v>

334
00:16:37.690 --> 00:16:37.690
<v Speaker 1>not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well.</v>

335
00:16:37.690 --> 00:16:41.070
<v Speaker 1>He.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of them has publicly stated that </v>

336
00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:46.240
<v Speaker 1>white people are inferior to black </v>
<v Speaker 1>people because they don't have enough </v>

337
00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:49.481
<v Speaker 1>melanin in their skin and Melanin is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>chemical that communicates cosmically so</v>

338
00:16:49.581 --> 00:16:54.581
<v Speaker 1>that you're spiritually enlightened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was one essential claim and the </v>

339
00:16:54.581 --> 00:16:59.171
<v Speaker 1>other one is is embroiled in lawsuit </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the University of Toronto Students </v>

340
00:16:59.171 --> 00:17:01.310
<v Speaker 1>Union for essentially she's been accused</v>
<v Speaker 1>of embezzling,</v>

341
00:17:01.370 --> 00:17:04.520
<v Speaker 1>embezzling with a couple of cronies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about $400,000</v>

342
00:17:04.521 --> 00:17:09.320
<v Speaker 1>from the coffers of the student's Union,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I felt that perhaps those weren't the</v>

343
00:17:09.321 --> 00:17:14.321
<v Speaker 1>best people to for the University of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Toronto to be associating with when </v>

344
00:17:14.321 --> 00:17:15.110
<v Speaker 1>they're formulating their anti racist </v>
<v Speaker 1>policies.</v>

345
00:17:15.110 --> 00:17:17.120
<v Speaker 1>Well clearly that makes you racist </v>
<v Speaker 1>clearly,</v>

346
00:17:17.210 --> 00:17:18.170
<v Speaker 1>clearly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

347
00:17:18.171 --> 00:17:22.890
<v Speaker 1>it's unfair as well altogether in one </v>
<v Speaker 1>little lump sump.</v>

348
00:17:22.891 --> 00:17:26.330
<v Speaker 1>That's man thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what's really fascinating about that</v>

349
00:17:26.331 --> 00:17:28.160
<v Speaker 1>is like you're not saying anything about</v>
<v Speaker 1>black people,</v>

350
00:17:28.190 --> 00:17:30.980
<v Speaker 1>you're saying about two individuals to </v>
<v Speaker 1>individuals that you and you're,</v>

351
00:17:31.060 --> 00:17:32.900
<v Speaker 1>you're having very specific.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

352
00:17:32.901 --> 00:17:35.150
<v Speaker 1>everybody that makes up a group is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same.</v>

353
00:17:36.050 --> 00:17:41.050
<v Speaker 1>You see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to understand that men and </v>

354
00:17:41.050 --> 00:17:41.050
<v Speaker 1>women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

355
00:17:41.050 --> 00:17:41.350
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Except men and women,</v>

356
00:17:41.390 --> 00:17:43.340
<v Speaker 1>men and women can be anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

357
00:17:43.341 --> 00:17:48.341
<v Speaker 1>there's an interesting angle on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>transsexual thing to a because these </v>

358
00:17:48.341 --> 00:17:52.211
<v Speaker 1>activists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they stand out and claim they're </v>

359
00:17:52.211 --> 00:17:52.211
<v Speaker 1>standing</v>

360
00:17:52.211 --> 00:17:52.500
<v Speaker 5>for oppressed communities right in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>first of all,</v>

361
00:17:52.501 --> 00:17:57.180
<v Speaker 5>they identify the identity group that </v>
<v Speaker 5>they're activated activating on,</v>

362
00:17:57.210 --> 00:18:02.210
<v Speaker 5>on the part of as a community and then </v>
<v Speaker 5>they imply that it's a generous </v>

363
00:18:02.210 --> 00:18:06.980
<v Speaker 5>community and then they state that </v>
<v Speaker 5>because they happen to be members of </v>

364
00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:08.460
<v Speaker 5>that community by their own admission,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's say,</v>

365
00:18:08.461 --> 00:18:13.461
<v Speaker 5>or by their own declaration.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a better word that they are now </v>

366
00:18:13.461 --> 00:18:14.550
<v Speaker 5>legitimate representatives of that </v>
<v Speaker 5>community.</v>

367
00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:19.820
<v Speaker 5>And one of the things that's been quite </v>
<v Speaker 5>fascinating to me since this has </v>

368
00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:22.641
<v Speaker 5>occurred is that I've had a very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a comparatively large number of letters </v>

369
00:18:22.641 --> 00:18:27.381
<v Speaker 5>from transgender people about 35 so far </v>
<v Speaker 5>and every one of those except one was </v>

370
00:18:27.381 --> 00:18:32.151
<v Speaker 5>positive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They are not happy about my sampling of </v>

371
00:18:32.151 --> 00:18:34.560
<v Speaker 5>the Trans Community,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which isn't,</v>

372
00:18:36.110 --> 00:18:41.110
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not a random sample or anything </v>

373
00:18:41.110 --> 00:18:41.110
<v Speaker 5>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but 35 letters is a lot.</v>

374
00:18:41.110 --> 00:18:44.620
<v Speaker 5>When the community of people is actually</v>
<v Speaker 5>quite small and they're not happy at all</v>

375
00:18:44.621 --> 00:18:45.160
<v Speaker 5>that they don't.</v>

376
00:18:45.450 --> 00:18:50.450
<v Speaker 5>They don't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're not happy to be so publicly </v>

377
00:18:50.450 --> 00:18:52.020
<v Speaker 5>discussed now because many of them would</v>
<v Speaker 5>just assume have some privacy,</v>

378
00:18:52.021 --> 00:18:57.021
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and they're already having trouble </v>

379
00:18:57.021 --> 00:18:58.281
<v Speaker 5>fitting in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They don't regard these people as </v>

380
00:18:58.281 --> 00:19:00.351
<v Speaker 5>legitimate representatives.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They don't believe they're not </v>

381
00:19:00.351 --> 00:19:00.960
<v Speaker 5>homogenous in their political </v>
<v Speaker 5>viewpoints,</v>

382
00:19:01.410 --> 00:19:01.900
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

383
00:19:02.050 --> 00:19:07.050
<v Speaker 5>and they're not necessarily fans of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>people who are playing gender bender </v>

384
00:19:07.050 --> 00:19:08.820
<v Speaker 5>games because many of the transsexuals </v>
<v Speaker 5>who are,</v>

385
00:19:08.821 --> 00:19:10.650
<v Speaker 5>let's say serious about it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

386
00:19:10.651 --> 00:19:15.651
<v Speaker 5>for,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for lack of a better way of describing </v>

387
00:19:15.651 --> 00:19:15.651
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>aren't happy that this has become a kind</v>

388
00:19:15.651 --> 00:19:20.211
<v Speaker 5>of a fad essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and that they're being used by the </v>

389
00:19:20.211 --> 00:19:20.820
<v Speaker 5>politically correct types to further </v>
<v Speaker 5>their political agenda.</v>

390
00:19:21.090 --> 00:19:26.090
<v Speaker 5>So that's quite cool to because it isn't</v>
<v Speaker 5>obvious to me at all that the attitude </v>

391
00:19:27.361 --> 00:19:32.310
<v Speaker 5>that I have towards the situation is </v>
<v Speaker 5>actually different in any genuine sense.</v>

392
00:19:32.311 --> 00:19:37.311
<v Speaker 5>Then the attitude that at least a </v>
<v Speaker 5>substantial minority of the transsexual </v>

393
00:19:37.311 --> 00:19:41.301
<v Speaker 5>people themselves have,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and there's plenty of them on youtube </v>

394
00:19:41.301 --> 00:19:44.010
<v Speaker 5>who are complaining about the social </v>
<v Speaker 5>justice appropriation of their,</v>

395
00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:46.260
<v Speaker 5>of their identity.</v>

396
00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:51.500
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't even know if they have a </v>

397
00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:51.500
<v Speaker 5>movement.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're not a community,</v>

398
00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:51.500
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean that they're not a community.</v>

399
00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:55.350
<v Speaker 5>I mean a community is in continual </v>
<v Speaker 5>contact with one another.</v>

400
00:19:55.351 --> 00:19:59.040
<v Speaker 5>They have something that directs their </v>
<v Speaker 5>actions in common.</v>

401
00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:00.540
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you know,</v>

402
00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:01.560
<v Speaker 5>on the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>on the,</v>

403
00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:07.100
<v Speaker 5>on the postmodern end of the spectrum,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you have some identifiable group </v>

404
00:20:07.261 --> 00:20:09.990
<v Speaker 5>feature,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then that means you're one of that group</v>

405
00:20:09.991 --> 00:20:14.991
<v Speaker 5>and that everything that you do </v>
<v Speaker 5>indicates indicates only that means </v>

406
00:20:14.991 --> 00:20:19.350
<v Speaker 5>there are believers in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in race and gender and sex.</v>

407
00:20:19.530 --> 00:20:24.530
<v Speaker 5>They believe in the reality of those of </v>
<v Speaker 5>those categories far more than anybody </v>

408
00:20:24.530 --> 00:20:27.620
<v Speaker 5>on the right as far as I can tell.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's very peculiar and,</v>

409
00:20:27.621 --> 00:20:29.280
<v Speaker 5>and unnerving,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so,</v>

410
00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:35.300
<v Speaker 5>so and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and widespread and powerful and all of </v>

411
00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:38.901
<v Speaker 5>those things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's very peculiar that they are not </v>

412
00:20:38.901 --> 00:20:40.140
<v Speaker 5>into labels unless it suits their </v>
<v Speaker 5>purposes.</v>

413
00:20:40.590 --> 00:20:45.590
<v Speaker 5>They're not in the labels or into a </v>
<v Speaker 5>generalizing behavior unless it suits </v>

414
00:20:45.901 --> 00:20:48.310
<v Speaker 5>their purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And also another thing that's weird</v>

415
00:20:48.310 --> 00:20:52.720
<v Speaker 1>to me is that whenever something becomes</v>
<v Speaker 1>an issue that becomes discussed,</v>

416
00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:56.680
<v Speaker 1>that becomes a hot button issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which clearly transgender rights,</v>

417
00:20:57.040 --> 00:21:02.040
<v Speaker 1>whether it's the North Carolina bill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to keep transgender people out of the </v>

418
00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:05.080
<v Speaker 1>bathrooms that associate with that </v>
<v Speaker 1>identify with that they identify with,</v>

419
00:21:05.110 --> 00:21:10.110
<v Speaker 1>with whatever gender it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whenever there's some sort of a hot </v>

420
00:21:10.110 --> 00:21:13.141
<v Speaker 1>button issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there becomes this thing where a bunch </v>

421
00:21:13.141 --> 00:21:17.260
<v Speaker 1>of people seek attention through those </v>
<v Speaker 1>issues and these people,</v>

422
00:21:17.830 --> 00:21:21.530
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>use whatever issue it is to be,</v>

423
00:21:21.690 --> 00:21:24.100
<v Speaker 1>it becomes like a part of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>identity,</v>

424
00:21:24.310 --> 00:21:26.750
<v Speaker 1>like becoming an activist and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

425
00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:29.960
<v Speaker 1>and really being very vocal about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas though the,</v>

426
00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:34.980
<v Speaker 1>the actual cause itself gets muddied in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the cult of personality and it gets </v>

427
00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:39.391
<v Speaker 1>muddied in these personal wishes and </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas that the people who are seeking to</v>

428
00:21:41.051 --> 00:21:45.550
<v Speaker 1>get attention by communicating about </v>
<v Speaker 1>these ideas sort of soak in.</v>

429
00:21:45.790 --> 00:21:46.230
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

430
00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:46.720
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

431
00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:52.200
<v Speaker 1>it just becomes a lot about human nature</v>
<v Speaker 1>and human behavior more than it is about</v>

432
00:21:52.331 --> 00:21:53.040
<v Speaker 1>the actual issue.</v>

433
00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:56.590
<v Speaker 1>And so it's an opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Each of these hypothetically contentious</v>

434
00:21:56.591 --> 00:22:01.390
<v Speaker 1>issues is an opportunity for a certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of sterile drama to unfold.</v>

435
00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:03.220
<v Speaker 1>And the drama is always the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

436
00:22:03.221 --> 00:22:05.050
<v Speaker 1>you can see that in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>

437
00:22:05.051 --> 00:22:10.051
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>demonstrations say with regards to my </v>

438
00:22:10.051 --> 00:22:10.051
<v Speaker 1>talks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter what I'm talking about</v>

439
00:22:10.051 --> 00:22:11.590
<v Speaker 1>and it actually doesn't matter what I've</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever said,</v>

440
00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:17.100
<v Speaker 1>all that matters is that there was an </v>
<v Speaker 1>occasion and an excuse to trot out the </v>

441
00:22:17.171 --> 00:22:22.171
<v Speaker 1>ideology and to end to pathetically </v>
<v Speaker 1>mouth the same unbelievably sterile and </v>

442
00:22:24.731 --> 00:22:26.440
<v Speaker 1>chaotic phrases.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

443
00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:29.350
<v Speaker 1>I mean the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the people at mcmaster,</v>

444
00:22:29.351 --> 00:22:34.351
<v Speaker 1>the protesters could only muster about </v>
<v Speaker 1>three chance and two of them were </v>

445
00:22:34.351 --> 00:22:38.311
<v Speaker 1>seriously obscene and I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I don't care about except that </v>

446
00:22:38.311 --> 00:22:42.301
<v Speaker 1>it's so mindlessly unimaginative in what</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is they're operating at such a low </v>

447
00:22:43.301 --> 00:22:45.460
<v Speaker 1>level of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of intellectual effort.</v>

448
00:22:45.820 --> 00:22:50.820
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and of course Egged on by their </v>

449
00:22:50.820 --> 00:22:52.180
<v Speaker 1>pathological postmodern professors who </v>
<v Speaker 1>are hiding behind them,</v>

450
00:22:52.181 --> 00:22:53.590
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like scared,</v>

451
00:22:54.010 --> 00:22:55.090
<v Speaker 1>scared weasels.</v>

452
00:22:55.660 --> 00:22:58.230
<v Speaker 1>So there's shut him down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the big one,</v>

453
00:22:58.240 --> 00:22:59.650
<v Speaker 1>racist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>transphobic,</v>

454
00:22:59.651 --> 00:23:04.651
<v Speaker 1>homophobic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these things without substance </v>

455
00:23:04.651 --> 00:23:04.750
<v Speaker 1>because there's no piece of shit was the</v>
<v Speaker 1>other one that was quite.</v>

456
00:23:04.780 --> 00:23:08.470
<v Speaker 1>That was quite a transphobic piece of </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit or just more,</v>

457
00:23:08.650 --> 00:23:09.880
<v Speaker 1>more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more specific,</v>

458
00:23:10.450 --> 00:23:15.450
<v Speaker 1>more specific,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was rather flattering and all of </v>

459
00:23:15.450 --> 00:23:15.450
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a.</v>

460
00:23:15.450 --> 00:23:19.810
<v Speaker 1>You don't seem to have any hate towards </v>
<v Speaker 1>trans people at all?</v>

461
00:23:19.870 --> 00:23:24.870
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean from the discussions I've had </v>

462
00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:26.761
<v Speaker 1>with you both on and off the air,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea of you being transphobic seems </v>

463
00:23:26.761 --> 00:23:29.860
<v Speaker 1>so inaccurate because you seem pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>accepting about anybody,</v>

464
00:23:30.070 --> 00:23:32.830
<v Speaker 1>whether it's a trans person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a gay person,</v>

465
00:23:32.870 --> 00:23:37.870
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The issue is a lot more concerned about </v>

466
00:23:37.870 --> 00:23:38.680
<v Speaker 1>whether or not people are honest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's what I,</v>

467
00:23:38.860 --> 00:23:42.010
<v Speaker 1>that's what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's my fundamental orientation.</v>

468
00:23:42.011 --> 00:23:47.011
<v Speaker 1>And so my fundamental concern,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I don't expect people to be 100 </v>

469
00:23:47.011 --> 00:23:49.330
<v Speaker 1>percent honest because of course who is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

470
00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:53.150
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's a hell of a required </v>
<v Speaker 1>standard to hold anyone to.</v>

471
00:23:53.150 --> 00:23:58.070
<v Speaker 1>But all of that is smoke and mirrors and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the people who are after me know</v>

472
00:23:58.071 --> 00:24:03.071
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but let's get through some of that just </v>

473
00:24:03.071 --> 00:24:03.071
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just to sort of establish it for people.</v>

474
00:24:03.071 --> 00:24:07.451
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they don't know what issues do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you have any issue whatsoever with </v>

475
00:24:07.451 --> 00:24:07.910
<v Speaker 1>someone being transgender?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

476
00:24:07.911 --> 00:24:12.911
<v Speaker 1>I don't have any issue with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I have an issue with is that is </v>

477
00:24:12.911 --> 00:24:16.570
<v Speaker 1>that I don't like to see the postmodern </v>
<v Speaker 1>Neil Marxists use the trans sexual issue</v>

478
00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:21.560
<v Speaker 1>as a lever for pushing forward their </v>
<v Speaker 1>political nonsense and I said that right</v>

479
00:24:21.561 --> 00:24:23.810
<v Speaker 1>from the beginning and the videos are </v>
<v Speaker 1>made to begin with.</v>

480
00:24:23.811 --> 00:24:28.811
<v Speaker 1>The reason I wouldn't use the word Z and</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] and all those other made up </v>

481
00:24:28.811 --> 00:24:33.101
<v Speaker 1>words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>however many there are now is because </v>

482
00:24:33.101 --> 00:24:35.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm not willing to cede the linguistic </v>
<v Speaker 1>territory to postmodern radicals.</v>

483
00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:37.400
<v Speaker 1>I'm not doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they say,</v>

484
00:24:37.401 --> 00:24:42.401
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're doing it on behalf of the </v>

485
00:24:42.401 --> 00:24:42.401
<v Speaker 1>oppressed transsexual people.</v>

486
00:24:42.401 --> 00:24:42.401
<v Speaker 1>And I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

487
00:24:42.401 --> 00:24:46.601
<v Speaker 1>well that's what you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's no reason I should believe </v>

488
00:24:46.601 --> 00:24:46.601
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't believe anything you say.</v>

489
00:24:46.601 --> 00:24:48.680
<v Speaker 1>I think you're contemptible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cowardly,</v>

490
00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:53.870
<v Speaker 1>ideologically motivated cult like </v>
<v Speaker 1>corruptors of the youth.</v>

491
00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:56.260
<v Speaker 1>So why would I use your language?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

492
00:24:56.261 --> 00:25:01.261
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's unpack that because one of the </v>

493
00:25:01.261 --> 00:25:02.720
<v Speaker 1>things that I find fascinating is how </v>
<v Speaker 1>few transgender people want to use those</v>

494
00:25:02.721 --> 00:25:07.721
<v Speaker 1>words that transgender people seem to </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to identify with whatever gender </v>

495
00:25:07.721 --> 00:25:07.721
<v Speaker 1>they like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If,</v>

496
00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:10.910
<v Speaker 1>if you are a male to female transgender </v>
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>

497
00:25:10.911 --> 00:25:15.911
<v Speaker 1>you would prefer to be called the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She like Caitlyn Jenner and pretty much </v>

498
00:25:15.911 --> 00:25:19.160
<v Speaker 1>everybody calls the artist formerly </v>
<v Speaker 1>known as Bruce Jenner,</v>

499
00:25:19.340 --> 00:25:20.390
<v Speaker 1>Caitlyn Jenner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

500
00:25:20.391 --> 00:25:21.100
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just.</v>

501
00:25:21.170 --> 00:25:26.170
<v Speaker 1>It's like if you had a look at how many </v>
<v Speaker 1>people just openly accept that it's </v>

502
00:25:26.470 --> 00:25:28.160
<v Speaker 1>pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty well accepted.</v>

503
00:25:28.161 --> 00:25:31.760
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most transgender people prefer that they</v>

504
00:25:31.761 --> 00:25:35.900
<v Speaker 1>prefer a female to male.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I prefer they prefer to be a man now.</v>

505
00:25:35.930 --> 00:25:37.150
<v Speaker 1>I'm a man now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

506
00:25:37.250 --> 00:25:38.480
<v Speaker 1>Bob,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dick,</v>

507
00:25:38.481 --> 00:25:41.800
<v Speaker 1>whatever your name is that's in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's not a lot of ze Zer.</v>

508
00:25:42.150 --> 00:25:43.530
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

509
00:25:43.550 --> 00:25:48.550
<v Speaker 1>you're not out of the loop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other thing is those are all third </v>

510
00:25:48.550 --> 00:25:48.550
<v Speaker 1>person pronouns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

511
00:25:48.550 --> 00:25:48.740
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to call you a third person</v>

512
00:25:48.741 --> 00:25:50.090
<v Speaker 1>Pronoun while we're sitting here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

513
00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:53.480
<v Speaker 1>I never would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I'm referring to you when I'm talking</v>

514
00:25:53.481 --> 00:25:54.710
<v Speaker 1>to someone else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>call her name.</v>

515
00:25:54.730 --> 00:25:55.220
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

516
00:25:55.221 --> 00:25:56.540
<v Speaker 1>I could use your name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your name.</v>

517
00:25:56.541 --> 00:25:59.240
<v Speaker 1>I might use he then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know.</v>

518
00:25:59.330 --> 00:26:02.600
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just all of it is palpably absurd.</v>

519
00:26:03.050 --> 00:26:08.050
<v Speaker 1>I think it's always hard to get the </v>
<v Speaker 1>level of analysis for this sort of </v>

520
00:26:08.050 --> 00:26:08.050
<v Speaker 1>issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Correct,</v>

521
00:26:08.050 --> 00:26:12.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the people who were pushing it </v>

522
00:26:12.670 --> 00:26:12.670
<v Speaker 1>forward say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

523
00:26:12.670 --> 00:26:15.460
<v Speaker 1>we're against harassment and and and </v>
<v Speaker 1>discrimination and and they attributed </v>

524
00:26:17.381 --> 00:26:22.381
<v Speaker 1>all the moral virtue to themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then what I see is that they're </v>

525
00:26:22.381 --> 00:26:25.180
<v Speaker 1>utilizing a group,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a very small minority group who already </v>

526
00:26:25.180 --> 00:26:26.900
<v Speaker 1>have enough problems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my estimation,</v>

527
00:26:27.260 --> 00:26:30.800
<v Speaker 1>for for nothing other than </v>
<v Speaker 1>straightforward political purposes.</v>

528
00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:36.160
<v Speaker 1>I don't buy the the warm hearted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll all inclusive.</v>

529
00:26:37.011 --> 00:26:39.830
<v Speaker 1>Love that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The people who are pushing this of thing</v>

530
00:26:39.831 --> 00:26:42.230
<v Speaker 1>for we claim to display.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't see that at all.</v>

531
00:26:42.410 --> 00:26:43.620
<v Speaker 1>What I see mostly as</v>

532
00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:49.070
<v Speaker 5>resentment and the desire to undermine </v>
<v Speaker 5>and I'm quite familiar with the </v>

533
00:26:49.070 --> 00:26:52.611
<v Speaker 5>postmodern philosophy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not as familiar as I could be and also </v>

534
00:26:52.611 --> 00:26:55.380
<v Speaker 5>reasonably familiar with its underlying </v>
<v Speaker 5>Marxism and there's nothing touchy feely</v>

535
00:26:55.381 --> 00:26:57.870
<v Speaker 5>about any of that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can tell you the postmodernist,</v>

536
00:26:57.900 --> 00:27:01.050
<v Speaker 5>the best you can do with poetry,</v>
<v Speaker 5>postmodernist philosophy is emerged.</v>

537
00:27:01.051 --> 00:27:03.150
<v Speaker 5>Nihilistic.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the best.</v>

538
00:27:03.330 --> 00:27:06.390
<v Speaker 5>The worst case is that you're kind of an</v>
<v Speaker 5>article,</v>

539
00:27:06.391 --> 00:27:11.391
<v Speaker 5>social revolutionary.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's directionless except that you </v>

540
00:27:11.391 --> 00:27:13.200
<v Speaker 5>want to tear things apart or,</v>
<v Speaker 5>or that you end up depressed,</v>

541
00:27:13.201 --> 00:27:18.201
<v Speaker 5>which I see happening to students all </v>
<v Speaker 5>the time because the postmodernist like </v>

542
00:27:18.201 --> 00:27:20.970
<v Speaker 5>rip out the remaining fee structures of </v>
<v Speaker 5>their foundations,</v>

543
00:27:20.971 --> 00:27:22.350
<v Speaker 5>of their ethical foundations.</v>

544
00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:27.180
<v Speaker 1>So just to be really clear for anybody </v>
<v Speaker 1>tuning in your issues are absolutely not</v>

545
00:27:27.210 --> 00:27:32.210
<v Speaker 1>with someone who identifies with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>gender other than their biological </v>

546
00:27:32.210 --> 00:27:35.391
<v Speaker 1>gender,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as long as they're not using that to </v>

547
00:27:35.391 --> 00:27:36.870
<v Speaker 1>promote a political agenda.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't care about the gender thing.</v>

548
00:27:37.060 --> 00:27:39.360
<v Speaker 1>That's doesn't mean anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

549
00:27:39.361 --> 00:27:40.060
<v Speaker 1>it's someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

550
00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:41.520
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a personal preference,</v>

551
00:27:41.950 --> 00:27:44.490
<v Speaker 5>personal issue personally,</v>
<v Speaker 5>personal issue.</v>

552
00:27:44.550 --> 00:27:49.550
<v Speaker 5>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I would also deal with it on an </v>

553
00:27:49.550 --> 00:27:49.770
<v Speaker 5>individual to individual</v>

554
00:27:49.770 --> 00:27:54.770
<v Speaker 1>basis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It varies just as much as they're </v>

555
00:27:54.770 --> 00:27:54.770
<v Speaker 1>extremely masculine men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>extremely feminine women.</v>

556
00:27:54.770 --> 00:27:58.770
<v Speaker 1>And there's a broad spectrum of human </v>
<v Speaker 1>beings in between and each one should be</v>

557
00:27:58.771 --> 00:28:00.960
<v Speaker 1>dealt with on an individual basis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

558
00:28:00.990 --> 00:28:05.820
<v Speaker 1>based on what they want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when you're talking about these made</v>

559
00:28:05.821 --> 00:28:10.821
<v Speaker 1>up words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it seems like as it some people </v>

560
00:28:10.821 --> 00:28:13.170
<v Speaker 1>trying to push these made up words and </v>
<v Speaker 1>turn them mainstream.</v>

561
00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:15.870
<v Speaker 1>Now the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the motivation behind that?</v>

562
00:28:15.871 --> 00:28:20.871
<v Speaker 1>Is this unnecessary thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are there so many people that are of </v>

563
00:28:20.871 --> 00:28:25.341
<v Speaker 1>asexual or have some sort of mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would be a z or preserve?</v>

564
00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:31.160
<v Speaker 1>What is that supposed to be?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that supposed to be a male or a </v>

565
00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:31.980
<v Speaker 1>female?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it's supposed to be a sexual or is it</v>

566
00:28:31.981 --> 00:28:35.370
<v Speaker 1>supposed to be a nonconformist lean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is it?</v>

567
00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:40.580
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's supposed to be someone who who's </v>

568
00:28:40.580 --> 00:28:40.580
<v Speaker 1>gender isn't specified,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

569
00:28:40.580 --> 00:28:45.350
<v Speaker 1>Who is neither male nor female,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or maybe they say they say technically </v>

570
00:28:45.350 --> 00:28:49.521
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the policy guidelines is anywhere or </v>

571
00:28:49.521 --> 00:28:53.421
<v Speaker 1>nowhere on the spectrum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's actually in the policy </v>

572
00:28:53.421 --> 00:28:53.700
<v Speaker 1>guidelines in Ontario where or nowhere</v>

573
00:28:53.980 --> 00:28:55.570
<v Speaker 5>and the nowhere.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean these are.</v>

574
00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:58.300
<v Speaker 5>These are policies that are,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that are going to determine law,</v>

575
00:28:58.330 --> 00:28:59.980
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That within which the law is going to be</v>

576
00:28:59.981 --> 00:29:04.981
<v Speaker 5>interpreted.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't even know what nowhere on the </v>

577
00:29:04.981 --> 00:29:05.020
<v Speaker 5>spectrum means.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't understand what that means.</v>

578
00:29:05.130 --> 00:29:06.930
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't mean anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's nonsense.</v>

579
00:29:06.990 --> 00:29:08.880
<v Speaker 1>It's nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have.</v>

580
00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:10.830
<v Speaker 1>So here's the options,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

581
00:29:11.070 --> 00:29:16.070
<v Speaker 1>There's someone who identifies with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>opposite gender of their biological </v>

582
00:29:16.591 --> 00:29:18.240
<v Speaker 1>birth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a man,</v>

583
00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:21.150
<v Speaker 1>for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who identifies as a woman,</v>

584
00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:24.030
<v Speaker 1>everyone's cool with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever your name is,</v>

585
00:29:24.031 --> 00:29:29.031
<v Speaker 1>whatever you would like to be called,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's Wendy or Mike or whatever </v>

586
00:29:29.031 --> 00:29:32.751
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be the noise that you want </v>

587
00:29:32.751 --> 00:29:32.751
<v Speaker 1>people to make with their mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That means you.</v>

588
00:29:33.180 --> 00:29:36.810
<v Speaker 1>That's it right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether you're a he or a she.</v>

589
00:29:36.811 --> 00:29:39.120
<v Speaker 1>Outside of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where things get squirrely.</v>

590
00:29:39.210 --> 00:29:44.210
<v Speaker 1>So third person is the only issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only issue is like say if we were </v>

591
00:29:44.210 --> 00:29:44.710
<v Speaker 1>talking to Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie just decided to.</v>

592
00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:48.850
<v Speaker 1>He's going to be Jamie now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He still Jamie Jamie's girl's name too.</v>

593
00:29:49.180 --> 00:29:54.180
<v Speaker 1>I know girls named Jamie so he could be </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie and Jamie decides he's a woman and</v>

594
00:29:55.450 --> 00:29:56.740
<v Speaker 1>now he wants to be called.</v>

595
00:29:56.740 --> 00:29:58.150
<v Speaker 1>She was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

596
00:29:58.540 --> 00:30:00.130
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She Alright Jamie.</v>

597
00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:05.280
<v Speaker 1>Now your she.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when it gets to like xer and Z and </v>

598
00:30:06.191 --> 00:30:11.191
<v Speaker 1>the 78 different gender pronouns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems to a person outside of it </v>

599
00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:15.250
<v Speaker 1>person who's CIS gendered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems pretty,</v>

600
00:30:15.490 --> 00:30:20.490
<v Speaker 1>pretty bizarre and it seems pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>preposterous and it seems pretty </v>

601
00:30:20.490 --> 00:30:21.940
<v Speaker 1>indulgent and it seems like there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>something else going on in this.</v>

602
00:30:22.140 --> 00:30:23.090
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

603
00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:26.590
<v Speaker 1>it's something else going on park.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is what concerns me.</v>

604
00:30:26.591 --> 00:30:30.640
<v Speaker 1>There is something else going on in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If there wasn't something else going on,</v>

605
00:30:30.950 --> 00:30:35.950
<v Speaker 1>I'm a relatively obscure professors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>amateurish youtube videos on a </v>

606
00:30:36.910 --> 00:30:39.730
<v Speaker 1>relatively obscure piece of Canadian </v>
<v Speaker 1>legislation.</v>

607
00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:41.380
<v Speaker 1>Wouldn't have had any effect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

608
00:30:41.381 --> 00:30:43.230
<v Speaker 1>It would have just disappeared,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

609
00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:48.240
<v Speaker 1>It didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're not because there's more </v>

610
00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:50.071
<v Speaker 1>going on than than a straightforward </v>
<v Speaker 1>issue surrounding the pronoun use and </v>

611
00:30:50.071 --> 00:30:54.721
<v Speaker 1>everybody knows it or everybody feels </v>
<v Speaker 1>that at least what it seems like from </v>

612
00:30:54.721 --> 00:30:59.131
<v Speaker 1>someone outside of academia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone like me is it seems like you're </v>

613
00:30:59.131 --> 00:31:03.491
<v Speaker 1>pushing back against something that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>are really trying hard to establish and </v>

614
00:31:04.871 --> 00:31:09.871
<v Speaker 1>then it's some kind of control at some </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of control with how people behave </v>

615
00:31:10.601 --> 00:31:13.000
<v Speaker 1>and communicate and it's not.</v>

616
00:31:13.180 --> 00:31:17.230
<v Speaker 1>It's not like a societal thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very small,</v>

617
00:31:17.290 --> 00:31:21.580
<v Speaker 1>isolated group of people that seem to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to indoctrinate others into their</v>

618
00:31:21.581 --> 00:31:26.581
<v Speaker 1>ways and they become.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're becoming a very vocal and very </v>

619
00:31:26.581 --> 00:31:30.421
<v Speaker 1>angry and verbally violent about your </v>
<v Speaker 1>opposition to their controlling the way </v>

620
00:31:32.621 --> 00:31:37.621
<v Speaker 1>they can that other people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't like poking holes in the </v>

621
00:31:37.621 --> 00:31:38.610
<v Speaker 1>radiology and the post.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Post here,</v>

622
00:31:38.630 --> 00:31:41.170
<v Speaker 1>we could lay it out quickly because I've</v>
<v Speaker 1>been,</v>

623
00:31:41.260 --> 00:31:46.260
<v Speaker 1>I've been thinking about how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>communicate this properly and so the </v>

624
00:31:46.260 --> 00:31:50.311
<v Speaker 1>thing about the postmodernists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm going to speak mostly about </v>

625
00:31:50.311 --> 00:31:51.970
<v Speaker 1>Jacques Derrida because all consider him</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the central villain.</v>

626
00:31:52.450 --> 00:31:54.400
<v Speaker 1>Now he actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

627
00:31:54.550 --> 00:31:57.260
<v Speaker 1>he may make a point explain who he is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

628
00:31:57.280 --> 00:31:58.990
<v Speaker 1>he's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a French philosopher,</v>

629
00:31:58.991 --> 00:32:03.991
<v Speaker 1>French intellectual who became quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>popular in the late 19 seventies and </v>

630
00:32:03.991 --> 00:32:08.461
<v Speaker 1>then was introduced to North America </v>
<v Speaker 1>through the Yale Department of English </v>

631
00:32:08.461 --> 00:32:11.641
<v Speaker 1>and of course English literature is one </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the disciplines that has become </v>

632
00:32:11.641 --> 00:32:14.431
<v Speaker 1>entirely corrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so Derrida wasn't Marxist to begin </v>

633
00:32:15.491 --> 00:32:20.491
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that fell out of favor because it </v>

634
00:32:20.491 --> 00:32:22.480
<v Speaker 1>turned out the Marxist political </v>
<v Speaker 1>doctrine kept producing evil empires and</v>

635
00:32:22.750 --> 00:32:27.750
<v Speaker 1>even radical left French intellectuals </v>
<v Speaker 1>were forced to admit that by the mid 19 </v>

636
00:32:27.750 --> 00:32:28.380
<v Speaker 1>seventies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

637
00:32:28.390 --> 00:32:31.000
<v Speaker 1>they'd put their head in the sand for 20</v>
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>

638
00:32:31.060 --> 00:32:35.890
<v Speaker 1>50 years really thoroughly in the sand </v>
<v Speaker 1>and made sure their ears were full too.</v>

639
00:32:36.190 --> 00:32:40.010
<v Speaker 1>But by the mid 19 seventies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the evidence that that was the case was</v>

640
00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:43.490
<v Speaker 2>so overwhelming that even a French </v>
<v Speaker 2>intellectual couldn't deny it anymore.</v>

641
00:32:43.491 --> 00:32:46.460
<v Speaker 2>And so they started to play sleight of </v>
<v Speaker 2>hand with the Marxist ideas.</v>

642
00:32:46.461 --> 00:32:51.461
<v Speaker 2>So instead of trying to promote the </v>
<v Speaker 2>revolution of the working class against </v>

643
00:32:51.651 --> 00:32:54.020
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>against the capitalist class,</v>

644
00:32:54.021 --> 00:32:57.260
<v Speaker 2>let's say they started to play identity </v>
<v Speaker 2>politics and said,</v>

645
00:32:57.261 --> 00:33:02.261
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can just separate everybody into </v>

646
00:33:02.261 --> 00:33:04.010
<v Speaker 2>oppressed versus so presser,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we don't have to do it on economic </v>

647
00:33:04.010 --> 00:33:07.061
<v Speaker 2>grounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so we and we can call it power </v>

648
00:33:07.061 --> 00:33:07.061
<v Speaker 2>instead of economics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that was part of it.</v>

649
00:33:07.061 --> 00:33:11.771
<v Speaker 2>And then the other thing about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamental critique that Derrida </v>

650
00:33:11.771 --> 00:33:16.030
<v Speaker 2>focused on this is this is this is </v>
<v Speaker 2>really worth laying out because that the</v>

651
00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:21.160
<v Speaker 2>problem that he discovered,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the postmodernist discovered was </v>

652
00:33:21.160 --> 00:33:22.010
<v Speaker 2>discovered by a variety of other people </v>
<v Speaker 2>at the same time in other disciplines.</v>

653
00:33:22.490 --> 00:33:27.490
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>among the people who were studying </v>

654
00:33:27.490 --> 00:33:28.970
<v Speaker 2>artificial intelligence since the early </v>
<v Speaker 2>19 sixties,</v>

655
00:33:28.971 --> 00:33:33.971
<v Speaker 2>it was always supposed that we'd be able</v>
<v Speaker 2>to make machines that could move around </v>

656
00:33:33.971 --> 00:33:34.340
<v Speaker 2>in a natural environment without too </v>
<v Speaker 2>much problem.</v>

657
00:33:34.730 --> 00:33:38.060
<v Speaker 2>And the reason we could do that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>because the world in some sense,</v>

658
00:33:38.061 --> 00:33:40.010
<v Speaker 2>was just made out of simple objects.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are,</v>

659
00:33:40.011 --> 00:33:45.011
<v Speaker 2>they are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what you have to do is look at them </v>

660
00:33:45.011 --> 00:33:45.011
<v Speaker 2>and you see them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's vision,</v>

661
00:33:45.011 --> 00:33:47.510
<v Speaker 2>and then the complex problem is not how </v>
<v Speaker 2>to see or what to see,</v>

662
00:33:47.511 --> 00:33:49.820
<v Speaker 2>but how to act in reference to what you </v>
<v Speaker 2>see.</v>

663
00:33:50.210 --> 00:33:53.660
<v Speaker 2>But it turned out that the AI people ran</v>
<v Speaker 2>into this problem,</v>

664
00:33:53.661 --> 00:33:56.630
<v Speaker 2>essentially sometimes known as the frame</v>
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>

665
00:33:56.631 --> 00:34:01.631
<v Speaker 2>And the frame problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that there's almost an infinite </v>

666
00:34:01.631 --> 00:34:01.631
<v Speaker 2>number of ways to look at a finite set </v>
<v Speaker 2>of objects.</v>

667
00:34:02.150 --> 00:34:05.900
<v Speaker 2>So the fact that that vision,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

668
00:34:05.901 --> 00:34:07.250
<v Speaker 2>it turns out to be way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>

669
00:34:07.251 --> 00:34:10.850
<v Speaker 2>way more complicated than anybody ever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ever estimated.</v>

670
00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:16.200
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't actually solve the vision </v>

671
00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:16.200
<v Speaker 2>problem until you solve the embodiment </v>
<v Speaker 2>problems.</v>

672
00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:16.200
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

673
00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:21.560
<v Speaker 2>an artificial intelligence that doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>have a body can't really see because </v>

674
00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:23.450
<v Speaker 2>seeing is actually the mapping of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world on to action.</v>

675
00:34:23.870 --> 00:34:28.870
<v Speaker 2>And so that was figured out more or less</v>
<v Speaker 2>by a robotics engineer called Rodney </v>

676
00:34:28.870 --> 00:34:28.870
<v Speaker 2>Brooks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

677
00:34:28.870 --> 00:34:33.790
<v Speaker 2>but what's at the bottom of this is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>idea that any set of phenomena can be </v>

678
00:34:33.790 --> 00:34:36.890
<v Speaker 2>seen a very large number of ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like there's a bunch of pens in front</v>

679
00:34:36.891 --> 00:34:37.990
<v Speaker 2>of me here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

680
00:34:37.991 --> 00:34:42.991
<v Speaker 2>and when I look at the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my brain basically notes that there are </v>

681
00:34:42.991 --> 00:34:45.910
<v Speaker 2>grippable object with which I can write.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I see the function like,</v>

682
00:34:45.990 --> 00:34:48.080
<v Speaker 2>like if you look at a beanbag,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see a chair,</v>

683
00:34:48.530 --> 00:34:51.110
<v Speaker 2>not because it's got four legs and a </v>
<v Speaker 2>seat and a back,</v>

684
00:34:51.111 --> 00:34:54.320
<v Speaker 2>but because you can sit on it and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and most of what we see in the world,</v>

685
00:34:54.321 --> 00:34:59.321
<v Speaker 2>we actually see functionally rather than</v>
<v Speaker 2>see as an object and then interpret the </v>

686
00:34:59.321 --> 00:35:03.311
<v Speaker 2>object and then figure out what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the function of the object </v>

687
00:35:03.311 --> 00:35:03.680
<v Speaker 2>constraints,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our interpretation.</v>

688
00:35:03.890 --> 00:35:06.020
<v Speaker 2>But there's an endless number of </v>
<v Speaker 2>interpretations.</v>

689
00:35:06.170 --> 00:35:11.170
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I was going to paint that paint on </v>

690
00:35:11.170 --> 00:35:14.351
<v Speaker 2>canvas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this set of pens and try to do it in a </v>

691
00:35:14.351 --> 00:35:16.900
<v Speaker 2>photo realistic way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would be looking at tiny details of </v>

692
00:35:16.900 --> 00:35:20.771
<v Speaker 2>these objects that the multiple shades </v>
<v Speaker 2>of red that are there and the multiple </v>

693
00:35:20.771 --> 00:35:22.580
<v Speaker 2>shades of white and black.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

694
00:35:22.610 --> 00:35:25.130
<v Speaker 2>I would decompose it in many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many ways.</v>

695
00:35:25.430 --> 00:35:28.490
<v Speaker 2>And so the AI guys ran into this </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem,</v>

696
00:35:28.491 --> 00:35:33.491
<v Speaker 2>which was that looking at the world </v>
<v Speaker 2>turned out to be exceptionally complex </v>

697
00:35:33.491 --> 00:35:35.000
<v Speaker 2>and that's still being solved now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

698
00:35:35.001 --> 00:35:37.070
<v Speaker 2>In literature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the same thing.</v>

699
00:35:37.510 --> 00:35:38.090
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What</v>

700
00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:41.640
<v Speaker 5>the postmodernists realized was that if </v>
<v Speaker 5>you took a complex book,</v>

701
00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.700
<v Speaker 5>let's say the Bible for example,</v>
<v Speaker 5>or a shakespeare play,</v>

702
00:35:45.150 --> 00:35:49.290
<v Speaker 5>there's an endless number of potential </v>
<v Speaker 5>interpretations that you can derive from</v>

703
00:35:49.291 --> 00:35:51.720
<v Speaker 5>it because it's so complex and so </v>
<v Speaker 5>sophisticated.</v>

704
00:35:51.721 --> 00:35:53.940
<v Speaker 5>So imagine that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

705
00:35:54.060 --> 00:35:57.330
<v Speaker 5>you can interpret the word,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can interpret the phrase,</v>

706
00:35:57.420 --> 00:36:00.000
<v Speaker 5>you can interpret the sentence,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can interpret the paragraph,</v>

707
00:36:00.001 --> 00:36:05.001
<v Speaker 5>you can interpret the chapter.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's say you have to interpret that </v>

708
00:36:05.001 --> 00:36:09.470
<v Speaker 5>within the confines of the entire work.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then have the entire tradition and then </v>

709
00:36:09.470 --> 00:36:13.530
<v Speaker 5>within the context of discussion that </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're currently having and all of those</v>

710
00:36:13.531 --> 00:36:16.380
<v Speaker 5>things affect how you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 5>interpret the play.</v>

711
00:36:17.070 --> 00:36:19.380
<v Speaker 5>So there's an so that their conclusion </v>
<v Speaker 5>was,</v>

712
00:36:19.381 --> 00:36:24.381
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's an infinite number of ways to </v>

713
00:36:24.381 --> 00:36:24.381
<v Speaker 5>interpret a text.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then their conclusion was,</v>

714
00:36:24.381 --> 00:36:28.311
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's an infinite number of ways to </v>

715
00:36:28.311 --> 00:36:28.311
<v Speaker 5>interpret the world.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And there's,</v>

716
00:36:28.311 --> 00:36:29.340
<v Speaker 5>there's a way in which that's correct.</v>

717
00:36:30.090 --> 00:36:35.090
<v Speaker 5>And so the next conclusion was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's no right way to do it so you </v>

718
00:36:35.090 --> 00:36:37.530
<v Speaker 5>could do it any old way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then their next conclusion was,</v>

719
00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:40.110
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and this is where the Marxism creeped up</v>

720
00:36:40.111 --> 00:36:41.040
<v Speaker 5>again.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

721
00:36:41.190 --> 00:36:45.540
<v Speaker 5>people interpret the world in a way that</v>
<v Speaker 5>facilitates their acquisition of power.</v>

722
00:36:46.140 --> 00:36:50.010
<v Speaker 5>Now that's where the bloody theory </v>
<v Speaker 5>starts to get corrupt because yes,</v>

723
00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:52.290
<v Speaker 5>a bit but also know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

724
00:36:52.291 --> 00:36:54.270
<v Speaker 5>Because,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and this is why they're wrong,</v>

725
00:36:54.540 --> 00:36:56.520
<v Speaker 5>this is why they're wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You see,</v>

726
00:36:57.960 --> 00:37:01.230
<v Speaker 5>the world is complicated beyond our </v>
<v Speaker 5>ability to comprehend.</v>

727
00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:03.690
<v Speaker 5>So there is a very large number of ways </v>
<v Speaker 5>you can interpret it,</v>

728
00:37:03.990 --> 00:37:08.990
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you have to extract out from the </v>

729
00:37:08.990 --> 00:37:13.851
<v Speaker 5>world a way a game from your </v>
<v Speaker 5>interpretation that you can actually </v>

730
00:37:14.131 --> 00:37:19.131
<v Speaker 5>play.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So if the lesson that you extract from </v>

731
00:37:19.131 --> 00:37:20.790
<v Speaker 5>hamlet is you should kill your family </v>
<v Speaker 5>and yourself,</v>

732
00:37:21.270 --> 00:37:24.540
<v Speaker 5>then we might say that that's not a very</v>
<v Speaker 5>functional interpretation,</v>

733
00:37:24.750 --> 00:37:24.990
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

734
00:37:24.990 --> 00:37:27.660
<v Speaker 5>Because first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people are going to object to that,</v>

735
00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:29.820
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It ends your life.</v>

736
00:37:29.821 --> 00:37:34.821
<v Speaker 5>It ends many people's lives.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People are going to object to it and it </v>

737
00:37:34.821 --> 00:37:35.550
<v Speaker 5>isn't a game that you can play over and </v>
<v Speaker 5>over again in the world,</v>

738
00:37:36.180 --> 00:37:38.430
<v Speaker 5>so when we're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when we're interacting with the world,</v>

739
00:37:38.431 --> 00:37:43.431
<v Speaker 5>you see what we're trying to do is to </v>
<v Speaker 5>extract out a set of tools that we can </v>

740
00:37:43.431 --> 00:37:47.361
<v Speaker 5>use to function in the world because </v>
<v Speaker 5>we're constrained by the world so that </v>

741
00:37:47.361 --> 00:37:50.670
<v Speaker 5>we don't suffer too much and so that the</v>
<v Speaker 5>things that we need in order to continue</v>

742
00:37:50.790 --> 00:37:55.790
<v Speaker 5>can be provided and we need to extract </v>
<v Speaker 5>those out in a way that other people </v>

743
00:37:55.790 --> 00:38:00.261
<v Speaker 5>will so that other people will cooperate</v>
<v Speaker 5>and compete with us in a peaceful and </v>

744
00:38:00.421 --> 00:38:03.000
<v Speaker 5>maintainable way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So then you think,</v>

745
00:38:03.001 --> 00:38:05.880
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we have to extract out an interpretation</v>

746
00:38:05.881 --> 00:38:10.881
<v Speaker 5>that allows us to live and thrive over </v>
<v Speaker 5>multiple periods of time in multiple </v>

747
00:38:11.131 --> 00:38:11.700
<v Speaker 5>environments.</v>

748
00:38:11.700 --> 00:38:16.700
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're doing the same thing with other </v>

749
00:38:16.700 --> 00:38:16.700
<v Speaker 5>individuals who are motivated the same </v>
<v Speaker 5>way.</v>

750
00:38:16.700 --> 00:38:21.440
<v Speaker 5>So there's a tremendous number of </v>
<v Speaker 5>constraints on our interpretations and </v>

751
00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:21.960
<v Speaker 5>the postmodernists don't care about that</v>
<v Speaker 5>at all.</v>

752
00:38:22.140 --> 00:38:23.370
<v Speaker 5>All they do is say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

753
00:38:23.710 --> 00:38:24.330
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

754
00:38:24.750 --> 00:38:27.180
<v Speaker 5>You can interpret the way the world,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the world any way you want.</v>

755
00:38:27.390 --> 00:38:32.390
<v Speaker 5>All people are ever doing is playing </v>
<v Speaker 5>power games based on their identity and </v>

756
00:38:32.390 --> 00:38:35.410
<v Speaker 5>there's going to be no crosstalk between</v>
<v Speaker 5>the power hierarchies.</v>

757
00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:38.260
<v Speaker 5>It's not even allowed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's why they don't engage in dialogue</v>

758
00:38:39.130 --> 00:38:41.620
<v Speaker 5>c just to talk to like let's say if </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're a.</v>

759
00:38:41.770 --> 00:38:45.400
<v Speaker 5>If you're a postmodernist just to have a</v>
<v Speaker 5>discussion with someone like you,</v>

760
00:38:45.401 --> 00:38:46.870
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a heterosexual,</v>

761
00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:50.530
<v Speaker 5>what do they call the CIS gendered male </v>
<v Speaker 5>of power,</v>

762
00:38:50.850 --> 00:38:51.540
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

763
00:38:51.560 --> 00:38:53.800
<v Speaker 5>and white to boot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like that's,</v>

764
00:38:53.830 --> 00:38:58.830
<v Speaker 5>that's an evil act in and of itself </v>
<v Speaker 5>because all you're doing by engaging in </v>

765
00:38:58.830 --> 00:38:59.230
<v Speaker 5>dialogue with that person is validating </v>
<v Speaker 5>their,</v>

766
00:38:59.560 --> 00:39:00.700
<v Speaker 5>their power game.</v>

767
00:39:00.970 --> 00:39:03.760
<v Speaker 5>That's all you see and this isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this isn't,</v>

768
00:39:04.030 --> 00:39:09.030
<v Speaker 5>this is no aberration,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that these people don't engage in </v>

769
00:39:09.030 --> 00:39:09.430
<v Speaker 5>dialogue,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that it's no aberration.</v>

770
00:39:09.431 --> 00:39:11.710
<v Speaker 5>It's built right into the philosophical </v>
<v Speaker 5>system.</v>

771
00:39:11.980 --> 00:39:16.980
<v Speaker 5>They regard the idea of the idea that if</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're in one power group and I'm in </v>

772
00:39:16.980 --> 00:39:21.841
<v Speaker 5>another,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the idea that we can step out of that </v>

773
00:39:21.841 --> 00:39:21.841
<v Speaker 5>group,</v>
<v Speaker 5>engage in a dialogue,</v>

774
00:39:21.841 --> 00:39:26.370
<v Speaker 5>have our worlds meat and produce some </v>
<v Speaker 5>sort of understanding of some sort of </v>

775
00:39:26.441 --> 00:39:28.960
<v Speaker 5>negotiated understanding.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

776
00:39:29.170 --> 00:39:33.250
<v Speaker 5>that's part of your,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your oppressive patriarchal game.</v>

777
00:39:33.251 --> 00:39:35.920
<v Speaker 5>That idea,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that whole idea is part of your game,</v>

778
00:39:36.820 --> 00:39:40.030
<v Speaker 5>so if I even engage in the dialogue,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm playing your game,</v>

779
00:39:40.031 --> 00:39:43.930
<v Speaker 5>you win.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a complete as complete.</v>

780
00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:49.560
<v Speaker 5>People don't understand that </v>
<v Speaker 5>postmodernism is a complete assault on </v>

781
00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:53.581
<v Speaker 5>two things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One is it's an assault on the </v>

782
00:39:53.581 --> 00:39:56.491
<v Speaker 5>metaphysical substrate of our culture </v>
<v Speaker 5>and I would say that the metaphysical </v>

783
00:39:56.491 --> 00:39:57.570
<v Speaker 5>substrate looks something like a </v>
<v Speaker 5>religious substrate,</v>

784
00:39:57.610 --> 00:40:02.610
<v Speaker 5>so it's a direct assault on that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and the second thing it's an assault on </v>

785
00:40:02.610 --> 00:40:03.670
<v Speaker 5>is everything that's been established </v>
<v Speaker 5>since the enlightenment,</v>

786
00:40:03.730 --> 00:40:05.260
<v Speaker 5>rationality,</v>
<v Speaker 5>empiricism,</v>

787
00:40:05.470 --> 00:40:07.300
<v Speaker 5>science,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everything,</v>

788
00:40:07.330 --> 00:40:09.010
<v Speaker 5>clarity of mind,</v>
<v Speaker 5>dialogue,</v>

789
00:40:10.120 --> 00:40:12.770
<v Speaker 5>the idea of the individual,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all of that is,</v>

790
00:40:12.900 --> 00:40:16.810
<v Speaker 5>is not only you'd see,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not only that it's up for grabs,</v>

791
00:40:16.900 --> 00:40:17.860
<v Speaker 5>that's not the thing.</v>

792
00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:22.000
<v Speaker 5>It's to be destroyed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the goal,</v>

793
00:40:22.330 --> 00:40:24.620
<v Speaker 5>to be destroyed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just like the Communists wanted,</v>

794
00:40:24.650 --> 00:40:25.140
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one,</v>

795
00:40:25.210 --> 00:40:27.670
<v Speaker 5>the revolution to destroy the capitalist</v>
<v Speaker 5>system.</v>

796
00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:30.820
<v Speaker 5>It's the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>These people now you might say,</v>

797
00:40:30.821 --> 00:40:35.821
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because every social justice warrior </v>

798
00:40:35.821 --> 00:40:35.821
<v Speaker 5>activist know this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like,</v>

799
00:40:35.821 --> 00:40:35.821
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

800
00:40:35.821 --> 00:40:36.760
<v Speaker 5>of course not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not.</v>

801
00:40:36.940 --> 00:40:41.940
<v Speaker 5>Not Anymore than any.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Every Muslim knows the entire Muslim </v>

802
00:40:41.940 --> 00:40:45.241
<v Speaker 5>doctrine or Islamic doctrine or every </v>
<v Speaker 5>Christian knows the entire Christian </v>

803
00:40:45.241 --> 00:40:45.241
<v Speaker 5>doctrine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

804
00:40:45.241 --> 00:40:48.070
<v Speaker 5>it's fragmented among people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but then when you bring them together,</v>

805
00:40:48.071 --> 00:40:51.280
<v Speaker 5>the fragments unite and the entire </v>
<v Speaker 5>philosophy acts itself out,</v>

806
00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:56.600
<v Speaker 3>so you don't think that this is a </v>
<v Speaker 3>nefarious plot by a few well planned out</v>

807
00:40:56.611 --> 00:41:01.611
<v Speaker 3>individuals that have some sort of an </v>
<v Speaker 3>agenda that they're going to promote </v>

808
00:41:01.711 --> 00:41:03.930
<v Speaker 3>this ideology because they and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>understand what they're doing.</v>

809
00:41:04.010 --> 00:41:09.010
<v Speaker 3>You feel like it's what you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that there's a bunch of different </v>

810
00:41:09.010 --> 00:41:10.130
<v Speaker 3>factions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bunch of,</v>

811
00:41:10.131 --> 00:41:15.131
<v Speaker 3>bunch of different parts to this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it could be a lot of it is that </v>

812
00:41:15.131 --> 00:41:18.960
<v Speaker 3>people feel disenfranchised socially.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

813
00:41:19.010 --> 00:41:24.010
<v Speaker 3>they are empowered by their positions in</v>
<v Speaker 3>universities and by these insulated </v>

814
00:41:24.300 --> 00:41:29.300
<v Speaker 3>environments and groups,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're intoxicated by the power that </v>

815
00:41:29.300 --> 00:41:32.490
<v Speaker 3>they have over young people and shaping </v>
<v Speaker 3>their minds and,</v>

816
00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:32.990
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

817
00:41:33.030 --> 00:41:38.030
<v Speaker 3>and imposing their ideologies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They receive feedback from these kids.</v>

818
00:41:38.420 --> 00:41:40.700
<v Speaker 3>It builds up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything strengthens.</v>

819
00:41:40.701 --> 00:41:45.701
<v Speaker 3>They shore up the walls around them and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they pushed this forward and then when </v>

820
00:41:45.701 --> 00:41:49.271
<v Speaker 3>they have something like this speech </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you gave at mcmasters and they get </v>

821
00:41:49.271 --> 00:41:50.600
<v Speaker 3>to actually act,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it unites them.</v>

822
00:41:50.790 --> 00:41:54.080
<v Speaker 3>That unites them and this is what you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting from this glazed eye,</v>

823
00:41:54.370 --> 00:41:54.870
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

824
00:41:55.530 --> 00:41:56.000
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

825
00:41:56.010 --> 00:41:57.370
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well it's,</v>

826
00:41:57.380 --> 00:42:00.330
<v Speaker 5>it's as if it's like Richard Dawkins </v>
<v Speaker 5>idea of meme.</v>

827
00:42:00.810 --> 00:42:02.670
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you imagine that in your,</v>

828
00:42:02.970 --> 00:42:07.970
<v Speaker 5>in your neuro neural structure,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever ideas that you're manifesting </v>

829
00:42:08.821 --> 00:42:13.440
<v Speaker 5>are represented neuron by neuron.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's say it's a web of neurons,</v>

830
00:42:13.800 --> 00:42:16.350
<v Speaker 5>not any one neuron has the entire idea </v>
<v Speaker 5>set.</v>

831
00:42:16.351 --> 00:42:18.990
<v Speaker 5>This is obviously an oversimplification,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you get the point.</v>

832
00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:22.260
<v Speaker 5>There's a network from which the idea </v>
<v Speaker 5>emerges.</v>

833
00:42:22.470 --> 00:42:27.470
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the meme idea is is that an idea can </v>

834
00:42:27.470 --> 00:42:30.480
<v Speaker 5>rest upon multiple individuals as if </v>
<v Speaker 5>each individual is a neuron,</v>

835
00:42:30.900 --> 00:42:35.900
<v Speaker 5>and so I mean there are people who are </v>
<v Speaker 5>more or less fully informed as to the </v>

836
00:42:38.371 --> 00:42:41.550
<v Speaker 5>nature of postmodern doctrine and </v>
<v Speaker 5>they're pushing it forward.</v>

837
00:42:41.910 --> 00:42:45.840
<v Speaker 5>Consciously and unconsciously.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There are consciously pushing it forward</v>

838
00:42:45.841 --> 00:42:50.841
<v Speaker 5>and acting it out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and so there are individuals who are </v>

839
00:42:50.841 --> 00:42:54.710
<v Speaker 5>more representative of the entire set of</v>
<v Speaker 5>ideas and individuals who are less </v>

840
00:42:54.710 --> 00:42:55.560
<v Speaker 5>representative,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but if you get them together in a group,</v>

841
00:42:55.890 --> 00:43:00.890
<v Speaker 5>the thing that animates them and unites </v>
<v Speaker 5>them is the common set of ideas and </v>

842
00:43:00.890 --> 00:43:03.760
<v Speaker 5>those ideas were produced by the </v>
<v Speaker 5>postmodern French intellectuals in the,</v>

843
00:43:03.820 --> 00:43:05.700
<v Speaker 5>in the mid seventies,</v>
<v Speaker 5>roughly speaking,</v>

844
00:43:05.900 --> 00:43:08.160
<v Speaker 5>shocked Derrida,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Michel Foucault.</v>

845
00:43:09.270 --> 00:43:14.270
<v Speaker 5>Foucault was the person who famously </v>
<v Speaker 5>pronounced that psychiatric diagnostic </v>

846
00:43:14.270 --> 00:43:17.850
<v Speaker 5>categories were primarily social in </v>
<v Speaker 5>origin rather than biological.</v>

847
00:43:17.851 --> 00:43:19.260
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I read,</v>

848
00:43:19.261 --> 00:43:24.261
<v Speaker 5>flew close work pink.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was madness and civilization where </v>

849
00:43:24.261 --> 00:43:25.830
<v Speaker 5>he,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he advanced that particular doctrine.</v>

850
00:43:25.980 --> 00:43:29.340
<v Speaker 5>You can actually read Fuko unlike </v>
<v Speaker 5>Derrida and uh,</v>

851
00:43:29.460 --> 00:43:31.640
<v Speaker 5>but I just found what he was writing </v>
<v Speaker 5>obvious.</v>

852
00:43:31.641 --> 00:43:36.641
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I knew from my clinical training that </v>

853
00:43:36.641 --> 00:43:38.220
<v Speaker 5>psychiatric categories have a heavy </v>
<v Speaker 5>sociological construction,</v>

854
00:43:38.221 --> 00:43:40.290
<v Speaker 5>partly because psychiatry is into </v>
<v Speaker 5>science.</v>

855
00:43:40.950 --> 00:43:44.190
<v Speaker 5>Medicine isn't a science,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's an applied science.</v>

856
00:43:44.191 --> 00:43:46.190
<v Speaker 5>Those aren't the same thing at all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>

857
00:43:46.200 --> 00:43:51.200
<v Speaker 5>a pure science is pure science that </v>
<v Speaker 5>deals with scientific categories like </v>

858
00:43:51.270 --> 00:43:54.750
<v Speaker 5>Adams,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but an applied science.</v>

859
00:43:54.960 --> 00:43:59.960
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a compromise between all sorts of </v>

860
00:43:59.960 --> 00:44:02.121
<v Speaker 5>different things and mental illnesses </v>
<v Speaker 5>themselves are shaped by the social </v>

861
00:44:02.121 --> 00:44:03.210
<v Speaker 5>environment.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Even though often they have a biological</v>

862
00:44:03.211 --> 00:44:08.211
<v Speaker 5>route,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the way they manifest themselves as </v>

863
00:44:08.211 --> 00:44:08.211
<v Speaker 5>clearly shaped by society and language.</v>

864
00:44:08.211 --> 00:44:11.880
<v Speaker 5>I didn't find his work the least bit </v>
<v Speaker 5>surprising.</v>

865
00:44:11.881 --> 00:44:12.780
<v Speaker 5>I thought.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well really,</v>

866
00:44:12.900 --> 00:44:17.900
<v Speaker 5>I mean everyone who's a sophisticated </v>
<v Speaker 5>medical professional psychiatrist,</v>

867
00:44:18.851 --> 00:44:20.850
<v Speaker 5>psychologist,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everyone knows that.</v>

868
00:44:20.851 --> 00:44:22.090
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

869
00:44:22.370 --> 00:44:27.370
<v Speaker 5>there's a book called discovery of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>unconscious by a guy named Henri </v>

870
00:44:27.370 --> 00:44:30.950
<v Speaker 5>Ellenberger,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jay that was written in the believe in </v>

871
00:44:30.950 --> 00:44:32.451
<v Speaker 5>the sixties,</v>
<v Speaker 5>great book on history of psychoanalysis </v>

872
00:44:32.451 --> 00:44:34.800
<v Speaker 5>and like he covers the shift and </v>
<v Speaker 5>diagnostic categories across time.</v>

873
00:44:34.801 --> 00:44:37.740
<v Speaker 5>It's self evident.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So anyways,</v>

874
00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:40.410
<v Speaker 5>there's all these French postmodernists.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They were all marxists.</v>

875
00:44:40.490 --> 00:44:43.380
<v Speaker 5>Most of them were student </v>
<v Speaker 5>revolutionaries in France in the late 19</v>

876
00:44:43.381 --> 00:44:46.560
<v Speaker 5>sixties before that all fell apart and </v>
<v Speaker 5>they did two things.</v>

877
00:44:46.680 --> 00:44:51.680
<v Speaker 5>They pulled out this frame problem,</v>
<v Speaker 5>issue the issue of multiple </v>

878
00:44:51.680 --> 00:44:52.470
<v Speaker 5>interpretations and said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

879
00:44:52.860 --> 00:44:55.680
<v Speaker 5>there's nothing that's canonical.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's no overarching narrative,</v>

880
00:44:55.681 --> 00:44:59.130
<v Speaker 5>there's no real interpretation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I already said why that's wrong.</v>

881
00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:03.300
<v Speaker 5>And then the other thing they said was </v>
<v Speaker 5>they did the slight of hand.</v>

882
00:45:03.300 --> 00:45:05.810
<v Speaker 5>So instead of the working class against </v>
<v Speaker 5>the verge was easy.</v>

883
00:45:05.811 --> 00:45:10.811
<v Speaker 5>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was race against race or gender </v>

884
00:45:10.811 --> 00:45:12.210
<v Speaker 5>against gender.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Unbelievably divisive.</v>

885
00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:17.240
<v Speaker 5>It's all they believe in his identity.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's no individual man that's gone </v>

886
00:45:17.240 --> 00:45:19.500
<v Speaker 5>with postmodernism.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This isn't an accident.</v>

887
00:45:19.501 --> 00:45:21.060
<v Speaker 5>All of this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not random.</v>

888
00:45:21.120 --> 00:45:25.710
<v Speaker 5>It's driven by these ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like ideas are always at war always,</v>

889
00:45:26.430 --> 00:45:29.550
<v Speaker 5>and we're in a war between these ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

890
00:45:29.551 --> 00:45:34.050
<v Speaker 5>Marxism we already know is tremendously </v>
<v Speaker 5>powerful doctrine and this is its newest</v>

891
00:45:34.530 --> 00:45:39.530
<v Speaker 5>manifestation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What is the motivation behind the </v>

892
00:45:39.530 --> 00:45:41.460
<v Speaker 5>individuals that are at the heart of </v>
<v Speaker 5>this movement?</v>

893
00:45:43.770 --> 00:45:48.770
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would say that the motivations are as </v>

894
00:45:48.770 --> 00:45:50.460
<v Speaker 5>complex as as human motivations are in </v>
<v Speaker 5>general,</v>

895
00:45:50.850 --> 00:45:53.550
<v Speaker 5>but they seem to have solidified into a </v>
<v Speaker 5>movement,</v>

896
00:45:53.580 --> 00:45:54.420
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

897
00:45:54.421 --> 00:45:58.440
<v Speaker 5>I think the dangerous part of it is that</v>
<v Speaker 5>the kind of.</v>

898
00:45:58.470 --> 00:46:03.470
<v Speaker 5>It's almost like a scapegoat mentality.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's almost like psychoanalytic </v>

899
00:46:03.470 --> 00:46:04.390
<v Speaker 5>projection.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's another way of thinking about it.</v>

900
00:46:04.391 --> 00:46:09.391
<v Speaker 5>So like one of the things that I've come</v>
<v Speaker 5>to learn and one of the things I talk </v>

901
00:46:09.391 --> 00:46:12.330
<v Speaker 5>about a lot is that the battle between </v>
<v Speaker 5>good and evil,</v>

902
00:46:12.331 --> 00:46:17.331
<v Speaker 5>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 5>isn't between states and it's not </v>

903
00:46:17.331 --> 00:46:21.350
<v Speaker 5>between the individuals precisely.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Although it manifests itself at those </v>

904
00:46:21.350 --> 00:46:21.350
<v Speaker 5>levels.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's an internal battle,</v>

905
00:46:21.350 --> 00:46:23.340
<v Speaker 5>a moral battle that happens inside </v>
<v Speaker 5>people.</v>

906
00:46:23.341 --> 00:46:28.341
<v Speaker 5>And so people have a broad capacity for </v>
<v Speaker 5>malevolence and for and for benevolence,</v>

907
00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:34.280
<v Speaker 5>and that's a terrible war for people and</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a terrible thing to understand and </v>

908
00:46:34.280 --> 00:46:34.680
<v Speaker 5>realize.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In fact,</v>

909
00:46:34.681 --> 00:46:39.210
<v Speaker 5>often when people realize their capacity</v>
<v Speaker 5>for malevolence,</v>

910
00:46:39.480 --> 00:46:44.480
<v Speaker 5>if they're not prepared for it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they develop posttraumatic stress </v>

911
00:46:44.480 --> 00:46:44.480
<v Speaker 5>disorder.</v>

912
00:46:44.480 --> 00:46:45.750
<v Speaker 5>So that happens to soldiers and </v>
<v Speaker 5>battlefields.</v>

913
00:46:46.140 --> 00:46:48.150
<v Speaker 5>So they go out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're innocent guys,</v>

914
00:46:48.180 --> 00:46:49.710
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>naive guys,</v>

915
00:46:49.711 --> 00:46:54.711
<v Speaker 5>young guys,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and they go out onto a battlefield and </v>

916
00:46:54.711 --> 00:46:55.020
<v Speaker 5>they get put in a really stressful </v>
<v Speaker 5>situation and you know,</v>

917
00:46:55.021 --> 00:46:57.990
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they step outside themselves and they do</v>

918
00:46:57.991 --> 00:47:02.040
<v Speaker 5>something unbelievably vicious and </v>
<v Speaker 5>brutal and then they're broken.</v>

919
00:47:02.700 --> 00:47:07.700
<v Speaker 5>They can't take that manifestation of </v>
<v Speaker 5>themself and put it with like Iowa Corn </v>

920
00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:10.770
<v Speaker 5>Fed,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

921
00:47:10.890 --> 00:47:15.890
<v Speaker 5>nice guy and no wonder because one is </v>
<v Speaker 5>like a flesh eating chimp chimpanzee on </v>

922
00:47:17.761 --> 00:47:19.620
<v Speaker 5>a war rampage.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the other is,</v>

923
00:47:19.621 --> 00:47:24.621
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a relatively well brought up and polite </v>

924
00:47:24.621 --> 00:47:24.930
<v Speaker 5>farm boy from the middle of the United </v>
<v Speaker 5>States.</v>

925
00:47:24.931 --> 00:47:29.931
<v Speaker 5>It's like how in the world you're going </v>
<v Speaker 5>to put those two things together while </v>

926
00:47:29.931 --> 00:47:30.310
<v Speaker 5>you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's posttraumatic stress disorder.</v>

927
00:47:30.730 --> 00:47:35.730
<v Speaker 5>And to treat that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my experience with posttraumatic stress </v>

928
00:47:35.730 --> 00:47:36.580
<v Speaker 5>disorder is that you have to teach </v>
<v Speaker 5>people a philosophy of evil,</v>

929
00:47:36.850 --> 00:47:39.880
<v Speaker 5>of good and evil,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because otherwise they can't recover.</v>

930
00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:41.020
<v Speaker 5>And I've had.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've had,</v>

931
00:47:41.021 --> 00:47:43.060
<v Speaker 5>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the last four months,</v>

932
00:47:43.420 --> 00:47:48.420
<v Speaker 5>I've had two letters from people from </v>
<v Speaker 5>soldiers with ptsd and I met to </v>

933
00:47:48.420 --> 00:47:52.500
<v Speaker 5>personally who said that watching my </v>
<v Speaker 5>lectures had had brought them back </v>

934
00:47:52.600 --> 00:47:57.600
<v Speaker 5>together because they couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 5>understand how they had become before </v>

935
00:47:57.850 --> 00:48:00.520
<v Speaker 5>looking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>looking deeply at,</v>

936
00:48:00.730 --> 00:48:03.040
<v Speaker 5>at the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>at their malevolence now.</v>

937
00:48:03.460 --> 00:48:05.770
<v Speaker 5>So I would say with regards to this </v>
<v Speaker 5>movement,</v>

938
00:48:05.771 --> 00:48:09.220
<v Speaker 5>this postmodern movement,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the malevolent aspect of it,</v>

939
00:48:09.250 --> 00:48:10.480
<v Speaker 5>there's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a couple of them.</v>

940
00:48:10.481 --> 00:48:13.270
<v Speaker 5>One,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's unbelievably authoritarian.</v>

941
00:48:13.510 --> 00:48:16.210
<v Speaker 5>Can I got a letter today from a </v>
<v Speaker 5>university student in Italy,</v>

942
00:48:16.211 --> 00:48:21.211
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what university,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but she'd been having kind of a flame </v>

943
00:48:21.211 --> 00:48:23.680
<v Speaker 5>war on facebook with a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>with a social justice warrior.</v>

944
00:48:23.681 --> 00:48:28.681
<v Speaker 5>And at the end she recommended that this</v>
<v Speaker 5>particular social justice warrior seek </v>

945
00:48:28.751 --> 00:48:33.751
<v Speaker 5>out a local mental health counseling </v>
<v Speaker 5>unit and put a link to it in the </v>

946
00:48:33.751 --> 00:48:34.060
<v Speaker 5>exchange.</v>

947
00:48:34.510 --> 00:48:36.550
<v Speaker 5>And then she got a letter from the </v>
<v Speaker 5>university.</v>

948
00:48:37.300 --> 00:48:41.320
<v Speaker 5>I guess the other person that sjw type </v>
<v Speaker 5>turned her in,</v>

949
00:48:41.530 --> 00:48:46.530
<v Speaker 5>but she got a letter from the university</v>
<v Speaker 5>saying that that violated university </v>

950
00:48:46.530 --> 00:48:49.951
<v Speaker 5>policy and constituted harassment and </v>
<v Speaker 5>that she should seriously consider </v>

951
00:48:49.951 --> 00:48:54.001
<v Speaker 5>retracting it and that future employees,</v>
<v Speaker 5>employers might be looking at what she </v>

952
00:48:54.371 --> 00:48:58.140
<v Speaker 5>posted and it was inappropriate to put </v>
<v Speaker 5>that on a public site and it's like,</v>

953
00:48:58.300 --> 00:48:59.770
<v Speaker 5>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wow,</v>

954
00:48:59.771 --> 00:49:03.550
<v Speaker 5>if.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How could you be so clueless as a,</v>

955
00:49:03.970 --> 00:49:08.970
<v Speaker 5>as a administrator say to think that </v>
<v Speaker 5>your monitoring of your students' </v>

956
00:49:09.910 --> 00:49:14.580
<v Speaker 5>private utterances,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're monitoring it at an institutional</v>

957
00:49:14.581 --> 00:49:19.581
<v Speaker 5>level and your intervention and threat </v>
<v Speaker 5>at an institutional level is less </v>

958
00:49:19.581 --> 00:49:21.610
<v Speaker 5>dangerous than lending to students,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

959
00:49:21.730 --> 00:49:24.160
<v Speaker 5>troll each other on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>on a,</v>

960
00:49:24.250 --> 00:49:26.890
<v Speaker 5>on a public social forum.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just,</v>

961
00:49:27.310 --> 00:49:29.560
<v Speaker 5>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what to think about it.</v>

962
00:49:29.561 --> 00:49:34.561
<v Speaker 5>It's just unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It happened and it's happening all over </v>

963
00:49:34.561 --> 00:49:34.561
<v Speaker 5>the place.</v>

964
00:49:34.561 --> 00:49:37.090
<v Speaker 5>This sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so there's the authoritarian element</v>

965
00:49:37.091 --> 00:49:38.860
<v Speaker 5>to it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is a hatred of.</v>

966
00:49:39.070 --> 00:49:44.070
<v Speaker 5>I think it's a hatred of competence </v>
<v Speaker 5>because competence produces hierarchies </v>

967
00:49:44.070 --> 00:49:48.180
<v Speaker 5>that aren't based on power.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's a hatred of clear </v>

968
00:49:48.180 --> 00:49:50.450
<v Speaker 5>intellect,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hatred of clear interlink.</v>

969
00:49:50.451 --> 00:49:53.010
<v Speaker 5>How so?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What do you mean when you say clear,</v>

970
00:49:53.260 --> 00:49:56.320
<v Speaker 5>but you have a clear intellect as far as</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm concerned?</v>

971
00:49:56.321 --> 00:50:01.321
<v Speaker 5>I think that's why you're so popular is </v>
<v Speaker 5>because you pay attention and say what </v>

972
00:50:01.631 --> 00:50:06.610
<v Speaker 5>you see and you're not too concerned </v>
<v Speaker 5>about doing anything other than that.</v>

973
00:50:06.611 --> 00:50:06.980
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

974
00:50:06.990 --> 00:50:09.670
<v Speaker 5>of course you have an agenda because </v>
<v Speaker 5>everyone has an agenda.</v>

975
00:50:09.671 --> 00:50:11.980
<v Speaker 5>You can't help but have an agenda if </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're alive,</v>

976
00:50:12.250 --> 00:50:17.250
<v Speaker 5>but you can temper the agenda like you </v>
<v Speaker 5>can be clued in enough to try to listen </v>

977
00:50:18.071 --> 00:50:22.510
<v Speaker 5>and learn and watch and pay attention to</v>
<v Speaker 5>what your own senses are telling you and</v>

978
00:50:22.511 --> 00:50:27.511
<v Speaker 5>try to articulate that and that's what </v>
<v Speaker 5>the logos is technically and the reason</v>

979
00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:33.100
<v Speaker 1>I'm bringing this up is because Jacques </v>
<v Speaker 1>Derrida described Western culture in a </v>

980
00:50:33.531 --> 00:50:35.090
<v Speaker 1>famous phrase.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He described it as</v>

981
00:50:35.200 --> 00:50:37.360
<v Speaker 5>fallow fell,</v>
<v Speaker 5>logocentric,</v>

982
00:50:37.361 --> 00:50:42.361
<v Speaker 5>p h a l logo l o g o centric fell logo </v>
<v Speaker 5>centric and it needs to be brought down </v>

983
00:50:44.140 --> 00:50:46.000
<v Speaker 5>while the Phallus part.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's male.</v>

984
00:50:46.720 --> 00:50:48.610
<v Speaker 5>The logo part.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's logos.</v>

985
00:50:48.790 --> 00:50:52.390
<v Speaker 5>Now that's partly logic because the </v>
<v Speaker 5>board logic comes from the word logos,</v>

986
00:50:52.600 --> 00:50:54.820
<v Speaker 5>but logos is a deep mate.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Much,</v>

987
00:50:54.821 --> 00:50:58.060
<v Speaker 5>much older concept and logic like logos </v>
<v Speaker 5>is.</v>

988
00:51:00.250 --> 00:51:05.110
<v Speaker 5>It's essentially a theological concept </v>
<v Speaker 5>and that's where things get complicated,</v>

989
00:51:05.111 --> 00:51:10.111
<v Speaker 5>but you could describe it as a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as the manifestation of truth in speech </v>

990
00:51:11.410 --> 00:51:12.620
<v Speaker 5>and the postmodernist.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They don't like</v>

991
00:51:12.750 --> 00:51:14.840
<v Speaker 1>any of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So foul logo center,</v>

992
00:51:14.850 --> 00:51:17.310
<v Speaker 1>some Legos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would be the ultimate mansplaining.</v>

993
00:51:17.430 --> 00:51:18.360
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

994
00:51:18.390 --> 00:51:22.710
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like any man who expresses a or tries to</v>

995
00:51:22.711 --> 00:51:27.090
<v Speaker 1>correct a woman in any way becomes a man</v>
<v Speaker 1>claiming to correct anything in any way.</v>

996
00:51:28.470 --> 00:51:32.340
<v Speaker 1>Particularly with you where the Ted </v>
<v Speaker 1>Cruz,</v>

997
00:51:32.341 --> 00:51:35.670
<v Speaker 1>Sally Yates testimony that's been going </v>
<v Speaker 1>on in America.</v>

998
00:51:36.480 --> 00:51:37.660
<v Speaker 1>Pretty fascinating because.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

999
00:51:37.680 --> 00:51:42.680
<v Speaker 1>I'm not aware of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw an example of that in Australia </v>

1000
00:51:42.680 --> 00:51:45.421
<v Speaker 1>and our congressional debate where a guy</v>
<v Speaker 1>was accused of mansplaining by one of </v>

1001
00:51:45.421 --> 00:51:47.760
<v Speaker 1>his colleagues and really tore a strip </v>
<v Speaker 1>off her quite nicely.</v>

1002
00:51:48.150 --> 00:51:49.770
<v Speaker 1>So what's happening in the states?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He will.</v>

1003
00:51:49.771 --> 00:51:54.771
<v Speaker 1>Yates has just been pretty brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was fired by the trump </v>

1004
00:51:54.771 --> 00:51:57.790
<v Speaker 1>administration because she rejected this</v>
<v Speaker 1>idea of um,</v>

1005
00:51:58.860 --> 00:51:59.940
<v Speaker 1>what was the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1006
00:52:00.240 --> 00:52:03.690
<v Speaker 1>the very specific things about </v>
<v Speaker 1>restricting immigration,</v>

1007
00:52:03.780 --> 00:52:08.780
<v Speaker 1>about shutting down a different people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are trying to come into the United </v>

1008
00:52:08.780 --> 00:52:08.780
<v Speaker 1>States.</v>

1009
00:52:08.820 --> 00:52:13.820
<v Speaker 1>And she had this debate with Ted Cruz </v>
<v Speaker 1>where she just brilliantly shut him down</v>

1010
00:52:14.310 --> 00:52:19.310
<v Speaker 1>with her knowledge of the Constitution </v>
<v Speaker 1>and knowledge of what is and what is not</v>

1011
00:52:19.861 --> 00:52:23.250
<v Speaker 1>legal or should or should not be allowed</v>
<v Speaker 1>to happen.</v>

1012
00:52:23.251 --> 00:52:26.700
<v Speaker 1>And she was fired for it and he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>grilling her and his,</v>

1013
00:52:27.210 --> 00:52:28.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a very smart guy,</v>

1014
00:52:28.651 --> 00:52:33.651
<v Speaker 1>ted Cruz.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although I don't agree with him and I </v>

1015
00:52:33.651 --> 00:52:33.651
<v Speaker 1>agree more with her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The wait was going down.</v>

1016
00:52:33.651 --> 00:52:38.391
<v Speaker 1>This debate was described as </v>
<v Speaker 1>mansplaining because it was a man </v>

1017
00:52:38.391 --> 00:52:40.350
<v Speaker 1>talking to a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a recent example.</v>

1018
00:52:40.351 --> 00:52:45.351
<v Speaker 1>I also read about something like that </v>
<v Speaker 1>with regards to the Supreme Court </v>

1019
00:52:45.351 --> 00:52:48.980
<v Speaker 1>because somebody did an analysis showing</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the female Supreme Court justices </v>

1020
00:52:48.980 --> 00:52:53.481
<v Speaker 1>spoke less than the male supreme court </v>
<v Speaker 1>justices immediately attributed that to </v>

1021
00:52:53.481 --> 00:52:57.171
<v Speaker 1>sexism because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how pressed female Supreme Court </v>

1022
00:52:57.171 --> 00:52:57.900
<v Speaker 1>justices are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1023
00:52:58.980 --> 00:53:00.120
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1024
00:53:00.160 --> 00:53:02.640
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the still want to get back to this,</v>

1025
00:53:02.670 --> 00:53:07.380
<v Speaker 1>that the hatred or the dislike of clear </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking.</v>

1026
00:53:07.500 --> 00:53:11.040
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that this comes from people</v>

1027
00:53:11.120 --> 00:53:16.120
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not even sure I completely wrapped </v>

1028
00:53:16.120 --> 00:53:18.441
<v Speaker 1>my head around this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but do you think this is from someone </v>

1029
00:53:18.441 --> 00:53:20.961
<v Speaker 1>with a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They understand that their logic is </v>

1030
00:53:20.961 --> 00:53:23.130
<v Speaker 1>muddy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They understand that they're imposing of</v>

1031
00:53:23.131 --> 00:53:26.190
<v Speaker 1>this muddy logic is illogical in some </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of a way.</v>

1032
00:53:26.250 --> 00:53:27.720
<v Speaker 3>They feel it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They feel it,</v>

1033
00:53:27.790 --> 00:53:30.370
<v Speaker 2>feel it rather than think it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1034
00:53:30.450 --> 00:53:35.450
<v Speaker 2>that's the other thing is that there </v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't a lot of clear thinking on the </v>

1035
00:53:35.450 --> 00:53:38.731
<v Speaker 2>side of the social justice types because</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of what they're doing is real </v>

1036
00:53:38.731 --> 00:53:38.770
<v Speaker 2>emotional,</v>
<v Speaker 2>emotional level.</v>

1037
00:53:39.050 --> 00:53:39.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1038
00:53:39.580 --> 00:53:42.100
<v Speaker 2>they're the best personality predictor </v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

1039
00:53:42.220 --> 00:53:47.220
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a politically correct belief because </v>

1040
00:53:47.220 --> 00:53:47.410
<v Speaker 2>we've done this study,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although it's not published yet,</v>

1041
00:53:47.411 --> 00:53:50.140
<v Speaker 2>is trait agreeableness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>agreeableness.</v>

1042
00:53:50.141 --> 00:53:53.560
<v Speaker 2>I would say the best way to think about </v>
<v Speaker 2>it is that it's the maternal dimension.</v>

1043
00:53:53.650 --> 00:53:55.900
<v Speaker 2>That's an oversimplification,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not much of one.</v>

1044
00:53:56.200 --> 00:54:01.200
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so anybody that the maternal </v>

1045
00:54:01.200 --> 00:54:04.831
<v Speaker 2>viewpoint,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's something like anybody who's part </v>

1046
00:54:04.831 --> 00:54:06.991
<v Speaker 2>of my ingroup is an infant in trouble </v>
<v Speaker 2>and anyone who's outside of it is a </v>

1047
00:54:07.570 --> 00:54:12.570
<v Speaker 2>predatory snake or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you're seeing that manifest </v>

1048
00:54:12.570 --> 00:54:13.270
<v Speaker 2>itself in a political doctrine.</v>

1049
00:54:13.460 --> 00:54:18.460
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you clearly seeing that today with </v>

1050
00:54:18.460 --> 00:54:19.060
<v Speaker 3>what's going on with these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1051
00:54:19.150 --> 00:54:24.150
<v Speaker 3>like say the Berkeley Milo rally where </v>
<v Speaker 3>people who are on the left,</v>

1052
00:54:26.600 --> 00:54:30.860
<v Speaker 3>who you would think of as being pro </v>
<v Speaker 3>woman pro,</v>

1053
00:54:30.861 --> 00:54:31.660
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1054
00:54:31.780 --> 00:54:36.780
<v Speaker 3>antiviolence are more than capable of </v>
<v Speaker 3>committing violence against women who </v>

1055
00:54:36.801 --> 00:54:41.801
<v Speaker 3>support trump because then they </v>
<v Speaker 3>categorize them as Nazis and we're </v>

1056
00:54:41.801 --> 00:54:45.311
<v Speaker 3>supposed to punch Nazis and I mean </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's been a bunch of instances where </v>

1057
00:54:45.311 --> 00:54:49.661
<v Speaker 3>you've seen video footage of people </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting pepper sprayed and hit with </v>

1058
00:54:49.661 --> 00:54:51.170
<v Speaker 3>sticks because they were wearing the </v>
<v Speaker 3>wrong,</v>

1059
00:54:51.230 --> 00:54:53.540
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're wearing or it wasn't even a make</v>

1060
00:54:53.541 --> 00:54:55.130
<v Speaker 3>America great again hat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was actually,</v>

1061
00:54:55.131 --> 00:54:56.690
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>make bitcoin great again.</v>

1062
00:54:56.691 --> 00:55:01.691
<v Speaker 3>Hap.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a very famous video of a girl </v>

1063
00:55:01.691 --> 00:55:01.691
<v Speaker 3>getting pepper sprayed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1064
00:55:01.691 --> 00:55:04.840
<v Speaker 3>I think I've seen that one fucking crazy</v>
<v Speaker 3>began by the left and by people who are </v>

1065
00:55:04.840 --> 00:55:04.980
<v Speaker 3>supposed to be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1066
00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:08.870
<v Speaker 3>quote unquote progressive and people </v>
<v Speaker 3>were supposed to be pro women's rights,</v>

1067
00:55:09.170 --> 00:55:11.450
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anti violence against women,</v>

1068
00:55:11.451 --> 00:55:14.900
<v Speaker 3>anti domestic violence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but yet they have no problem doing it to</v>

1069
00:55:14.901 --> 00:55:18.710
<v Speaker 3>this other person because this person </v>
<v Speaker 3>becomes the other because they're on the</v>

1070
00:55:18.711 --> 00:55:19.250
<v Speaker 3>other side.</v>

1071
00:55:19.390 --> 00:55:19.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1072
00:55:19.871 --> 00:55:24.610
<v Speaker 2>this I was talking about this line </v>
<v Speaker 2>between good and evil runs down people's</v>

1073
00:55:24.611 --> 00:55:25.120
<v Speaker 2>hearts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1074
00:55:25.121 --> 00:55:25.510
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1075
00:55:25.620 --> 00:55:30.620
<v Speaker 2>it's a terrible fault line and it can be</v>
<v Speaker 2>shocking to see that it's the case and </v>

1076
00:55:30.620 --> 00:55:35.251
<v Speaker 2>so it's much more convenient for people </v>
<v Speaker 2>to divide the world into the righteous </v>

1077
00:55:35.251 --> 00:55:40.171
<v Speaker 2>and the and the damned let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then to to persecute the damned </v>

1078
00:55:40.830 --> 00:55:41.130
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>

1079
00:55:41.131 --> 00:55:45.550
<v Speaker 2>It's convenient too because you whatever</v>
<v Speaker 2>resentment and hatred and bitterness you</v>

1080
00:55:45.551 --> 00:55:47.320
<v Speaker 2>have in your heart and you have plenty </v>
<v Speaker 2>of that.</v>

1081
00:55:47.321 --> 00:55:52.321
<v Speaker 2>Generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're a social justice type because </v>

1082
00:55:52.321 --> 00:55:54.751
<v Speaker 2>you regard yourself as oppressed and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then like that's a great starting point </v>

1083
00:55:54.751 --> 00:55:55.900
<v Speaker 2>for resentment and hatred,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1084
00:55:55.901 --> 00:55:57.580
<v Speaker 2>To be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be a victim.</v>

1085
00:55:58.810 --> 00:56:02.050
<v Speaker 2>We know that that one of the precursors </v>
<v Speaker 2>to genocide,</v>

1086
00:56:02.051 --> 00:56:04.330
<v Speaker 2>and I'm not saying at all that were near</v>
<v Speaker 2>that state,</v>

1087
00:56:04.331 --> 00:56:07.990
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but one of the precursors to genocide in</v>

1088
00:56:08.070 --> 00:56:11.500
<v Speaker 2>a genocidal state or in a pre genocidal </v>
<v Speaker 2>state is the.</v>

1089
00:56:11.600 --> 00:56:15.700
<v Speaker 2>The acceptance of victim status by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>eventual perpetrators.</v>

1090
00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:18.040
<v Speaker 2>Because the idea as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we're innocent,</v>

1091
00:56:18.041 --> 00:56:20.470
<v Speaker 2>we're being persecuted now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those people are going to get us.</v>

1092
00:56:20.471 --> 00:56:22.150
<v Speaker 2>So eventually that becomes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1093
00:56:22.151 --> 00:56:27.151
<v Speaker 2>we'll get them and it gives you have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>target for all your resentment and your </v>

1094
00:56:27.151 --> 00:56:31.801
<v Speaker 2>hatred and it's a justifiable moral </v>
<v Speaker 2>target and so all the parts of yourself </v>

1095
00:56:31.801 --> 00:56:36.481
<v Speaker 2>that you don't recognize as contributing</v>
<v Speaker 2>to whatever problem you think you know </v>

1096
00:56:36.481 --> 00:56:38.110
<v Speaker 2>now pollutes the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can ignore all that.</v>

1097
00:56:38.170 --> 00:56:43.170
<v Speaker 2>You're on the side of the good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no moral effort required and </v>

1098
00:56:43.170 --> 00:56:46.010
<v Speaker 2>then you have someone to conveniently </v>
<v Speaker 2>hate and hit and hurt and all the wild.</v>

1099
00:56:46.020 --> 00:56:47.770
<v Speaker 2>You can look at yourself in the mirror </v>
<v Speaker 2>and say,</v>

1100
00:56:48.160 --> 00:56:50.530
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm on the side of the good.</v>

1101
00:56:50.650 --> 00:56:52.360
<v Speaker 2>I'm just punching Nazis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

1102
00:56:52.361 --> 00:56:53.290
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is.</v>

1103
00:56:53.291 --> 00:56:55.220
<v Speaker 2>They're hitting them with bike locks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1104
00:56:55.221 --> 00:56:58.870
<v Speaker 2>while you dart out behind a woman who's </v>
<v Speaker 2>conveniently standing in front of you,</v>

1105
00:57:00.220 --> 00:57:05.220
<v Speaker 3>is there an evolutionary origin for what</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were talking about in regards to a </v>

1106
00:57:06.970 --> 00:57:11.970
<v Speaker 3>soldier being able to commit these </v>
<v Speaker 3>horrible atrocities in the name of war </v>

1107
00:57:12.520 --> 00:57:17.520
<v Speaker 3>to the these people that are able to </v>
<v Speaker 3>look at someone who has a different </v>

1108
00:57:17.520 --> 00:57:21.900
<v Speaker 3>ideology as the other and attack them as</v>
<v Speaker 3>almost like a sub human is.</v>

1109
00:57:21.920 --> 00:57:26.920
<v Speaker 3>Zero is some sort of an evolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 3>origin for this disassociative sort of </v>

1110
00:57:26.920 --> 00:57:29.290
<v Speaker 3>thinking and behavior that some people </v>
<v Speaker 3>seem to.</v>

1111
00:57:29.390 --> 00:57:32.860
<v Speaker 3>I mean it seems like a very common thing</v>
<v Speaker 3>throughout history.</v>

1112
00:57:33.110 --> 00:57:38.110
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anything that isn't part of your </v>

1113
00:57:38.110 --> 00:57:38.110
<v Speaker 2>dominance hierarchies?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A snake.</v>

1114
00:57:38.110 --> 00:57:43.030
<v Speaker 2>It's that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it actually makes sense from an </v>

1115
00:57:43.030 --> 00:57:43.130
<v Speaker 2>evolutionary perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1116
00:57:43.131 --> 00:57:46.640
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are tribal primates,</v>

1117
00:57:47.180 --> 00:57:52.180
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And on our optimal group size seems to </v>

1118
00:57:52.180 --> 00:57:54.461
<v Speaker 2>be something like 250.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can keep track of a boat that many </v>

1119
00:57:54.461 --> 00:57:54.461
<v Speaker 2>social relationships.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>

1120
00:57:54.800 --> 00:57:57.110
<v Speaker 2>that's also also number.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right,</v>

1121
00:57:57.111 --> 00:57:59.120
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's correlated with brain size,</v>

1122
00:57:59.121 --> 00:58:01.030
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So all right.</v>

1123
00:58:01.050 --> 00:58:03.470
<v Speaker 2>And so you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well why that size?</v>

1124
00:58:03.471 --> 00:58:08.471
<v Speaker 2>And then you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well hierarchy has to be optimized for </v>

1125
00:58:08.471 --> 00:58:11.330
<v Speaker 2>two functions in one is what you want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be able to climb the damn thing.</v>

1126
00:58:11.840 --> 00:58:13.250
<v Speaker 2>So if it's really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really big,</v>

1127
00:58:13.251 --> 00:58:18.251
<v Speaker 2>the probability that you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>climb it is really low and if it's too </v>

1128
00:58:18.251 --> 00:58:18.251
<v Speaker 2>small,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well who cares if you climate?</v>

1129
00:58:18.251 --> 00:58:22.950
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want it somewhere that let's go big </v>

1130
00:58:22.950 --> 00:58:25.220
<v Speaker 2>enough to climb and powerful enough to </v>
<v Speaker 2>make the climb worthwhile.</v>

1131
00:58:25.850 --> 00:58:28.940
<v Speaker 2>And so and so there's some optimization </v>
<v Speaker 2>there now,</v>

1132
00:58:29.390 --> 00:58:33.650
<v Speaker 2>so you might think of everything within </v>
<v Speaker 2>that hierarchy as explored territory.</v>

1133
00:58:34.130 --> 00:58:39.130
<v Speaker 2>And the reason for that is that explored</v>
<v Speaker 2>territory is where when you do </v>

1134
00:58:40.370 --> 00:58:42.290
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get what you want.</v>

1135
00:58:43.960 --> 00:58:48.960
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so think about the conditions under </v>

1136
00:58:48.960 --> 00:58:48.960
<v Speaker 2>which the limits of your knowledge </v>
<v Speaker 2>manifest themselves.</v>

1137
00:58:49.520 --> 00:58:54.520
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's also sorts of things you don't </v>

1138
00:58:54.520 --> 00:58:54.520
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1139
00:58:54.520 --> 00:58:57.291
<v Speaker 2>a trillion things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're not sitting there like </v>

1140
00:58:57.291 --> 00:58:59.700
<v Speaker 2>torturing yourself to death because </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a trillion things you don't </v>

1141
00:58:59.700 --> 00:59:02.251
<v Speaker 2>know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then if you go out in the world and </v>

1142
00:59:02.251 --> 00:59:02.970
<v Speaker 2>you act something out and the outcome </v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't what you desired,</v>

1143
00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:08.000
<v Speaker 2>then that registers an error.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's say you're at a party and you </v>

1144
00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:09.520
<v Speaker 2>tell a joke and no one laughs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1145
00:59:09.790 --> 00:59:14.790
<v Speaker 2>the party you see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>think about what happens to the space </v>

1146
00:59:14.790 --> 00:59:16.330
<v Speaker 2>around the party.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you tell the joke the second before</v>

1147
00:59:16.331 --> 00:59:19.690
<v Speaker 2>you tell the joke,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're in one place and the second after</v>

1148
00:59:19.691 --> 00:59:24.691
<v Speaker 2>you tell the joke,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when there's an awkward silence and </v>

1149
00:59:24.691 --> 00:59:24.691
<v Speaker 2>everybody's</v>

1150
00:59:24.691 --> 00:59:24.740
<v Speaker 5>looking embarrassed,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you are no longer in the same place.</v>

1151
00:59:24.860 --> 00:59:28.430
<v Speaker 5>You've stepped outside the protective </v>
<v Speaker 5>embrace of,</v>

1152
00:59:28.450 --> 00:59:33.450
<v Speaker 5>of that particular hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you've made yourself an alien and </v>

1153
00:59:33.450 --> 00:59:36.800
<v Speaker 5>the thing that people use to process the</v>
<v Speaker 5>alien is the is the snake detector,</v>

1154
00:59:36.920 --> 00:59:39.470
<v Speaker 5>the serpent detector,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the dragon detector,</v>

1155
00:59:40.280 --> 00:59:42.710
<v Speaker 5>and it's always been that way because </v>
<v Speaker 5>anything that's out side,</v>

1156
00:59:42.810 --> 00:59:45.500
<v Speaker 5>the hierarchy is a threat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Any stranger,</v>

1157
00:59:45.890 --> 00:59:48.230
<v Speaker 5>any strange idea,</v>
<v Speaker 5>any,</v>

1158
00:59:48.260 --> 00:59:50.390
<v Speaker 5>any,</v>
<v Speaker 5>any animal manifestation,</v>

1159
00:59:50.391 --> 00:59:52.670
<v Speaker 5>any noise,</v>
<v Speaker 5>any spirit,</v>

1160
00:59:53.360 --> 00:59:54.410
<v Speaker 5>it's an.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a,</v>

1161
00:59:54.530 --> 00:59:57.980
<v Speaker 5>it's a threat to the integrity of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>dominance hierarchy and in many,</v>

1162
00:59:57.981 --> 00:59:59.510
<v Speaker 5>many ways.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So for example,</v>

1163
01:00:00.020 --> 01:00:02.030
<v Speaker 5>it's deeply rooted because that was your</v>
<v Speaker 5>question.</v>

1164
01:00:02.090 --> 01:00:07.090
<v Speaker 5>What's the evolutionary basis?</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a great paper published in a </v>

1165
01:00:07.090 --> 01:00:10.241
<v Speaker 5>journal called plause,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one p l o s one about five or six years </v>

1166
01:00:10.241 --> 01:00:14.480
<v Speaker 5>ago looking at something absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 5>terrifying in my estimation,</v>

1167
01:00:14.481 --> 01:00:19.481
<v Speaker 5>which was there's this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's this idea that part of what </v>

1168
01:00:19.481 --> 01:00:21.290
<v Speaker 5>motivates the authoritarian end of </v>
<v Speaker 5>political conservatism.</v>

1169
01:00:21.470 --> 01:00:26.470
<v Speaker 5>So let's say the right wing fascist end </v>
<v Speaker 5>is associated not with fear but with </v>

1170
01:00:26.470 --> 01:00:30.611
<v Speaker 5>disgust.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Disgust is an entirely different </v>

1171
01:00:30.611 --> 01:00:33.371
<v Speaker 5>emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so these researchers did this </v>

1172
01:00:33.371 --> 01:00:36.191
<v Speaker 5>fascinating study where they went to a </v>
<v Speaker 5>number of different countries and also </v>

1173
01:00:36.191 --> 01:00:39.131
<v Speaker 5>looked at states within the same country</v>
<v Speaker 5>looking at the relationship between the </v>

1174
01:00:39.131 --> 01:00:43.001
<v Speaker 5>prevalence of infectious disease and </v>
<v Speaker 5>authoritarian attitudes at the </v>

1175
01:00:43.001 --> 01:00:45.140
<v Speaker 5>individual level.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The higher the infectious disease rate,</v>

1176
01:00:45.141 --> 01:00:47.330
<v Speaker 5>the more authoritarian,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the political views,</v>

1177
01:00:47.331 --> 01:00:49.010
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and the correlation was really high.</v>

1178
01:00:49.011 --> 01:00:51.230
<v Speaker 5>It wasn't like point one,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was point seven.</v>

1179
01:00:51.830 --> 01:00:56.830
<v Speaker 5>It's one of the highest correlations </v>
<v Speaker 5>between two phenomena I've ever seen in </v>

1180
01:00:56.830 --> 01:00:56.900
<v Speaker 5>the social studies sciences.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you might say,</v>

1181
01:00:56.901 --> 01:00:57.680
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why?</v>

1182
01:00:58.280 --> 01:01:03.280
<v Speaker 5>Well here's one reason I said that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The strange idea and the stranger and </v>

1183
01:01:03.351 --> 01:01:04.460
<v Speaker 5>the pathogen,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's say,</v>

1184
01:01:04.461 --> 01:01:06.170
<v Speaker 5>are all the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1185
01:01:06.171 --> 01:01:08.420
<v Speaker 5>it's all because they're external </v>
<v Speaker 5>threats to the structure,</v>

1186
01:01:08.430 --> 01:01:09.390
<v Speaker 5>the dominance hierarchy.</v>

1187
01:01:09.390 --> 01:01:09.870
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when they.</v>

1188
01:01:10.130 --> 01:01:12.230
<v Speaker 5>When the Spaniards came to the new </v>
<v Speaker 5>world,</v>

1189
01:01:12.530 --> 01:01:16.460
<v Speaker 5>95 percent of the natives died.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They died from smallpox.</v>

1190
01:01:16.461 --> 01:01:18.620
<v Speaker 5>They died from measles,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they died from mumps.</v>

1191
01:01:18.860 --> 01:01:23.860
<v Speaker 5>They died from chicken pox because you </v>
<v Speaker 5>don't know what the hell is coming at </v>

1192
01:01:23.860 --> 01:01:28.210
<v Speaker 5>you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When you let something new inside the </v>

1193
01:01:28.210 --> 01:01:30.041
<v Speaker 5>dominance hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whether it's an idea or a disease or a </v>

1194
01:01:30.041 --> 01:01:30.980
<v Speaker 5>virus.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that was Laurie.</v>

1195
01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:34.610
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that was a heroin addict author.</v>

1196
01:01:35.300 --> 01:01:36.410
<v Speaker 5>Boros Boros.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1197
01:01:36.411 --> 01:01:41.411
<v Speaker 5>That was his phrase.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Laurie Anderson made a nice video about </v>

1198
01:01:41.411 --> 01:01:43.961
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Words are a virus and so we respond to </v>

1199
01:01:43.961 --> 01:01:48.011
<v Speaker 5>them with the same circuitry that we use</v>
<v Speaker 5>to detect pathogens and I'll tell you </v>

1200
01:01:48.011 --> 01:01:51.941
<v Speaker 5>something even more frightening when we </v>
<v Speaker 5>were working this out because it's </v>

1201
01:01:51.941 --> 01:01:51.941
<v Speaker 5>associated with this trait called </v>
<v Speaker 5>orderliness,</v>

1202
01:01:51.941 --> 01:01:54.650
<v Speaker 5>which is actually a good predictor of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of right wing political belief.</v>

1203
01:01:55.340 --> 01:01:57.890
<v Speaker 5>I went back and looked at Hitler's table</v>
<v Speaker 5>talk.</v>

1204
01:01:57.920 --> 01:01:59.780
<v Speaker 5>It's a book,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hitler's table talk,</v>

1205
01:01:59.781 --> 01:02:04.781
<v Speaker 5>and he wrote that it was derived from </v>
<v Speaker 5>notes that were taken by his secretary's</v>

1206
01:02:04.940 --> 01:02:09.940
<v Speaker 5>between 1939 and 1942 when he was eating</v>
<v Speaker 5>dinner and spontaneously expounding on </v>

1207
01:02:10.580 --> 01:02:13.850
<v Speaker 5>the structure of reality.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was very open.</v>

1208
01:02:14.030 --> 01:02:15.680
<v Speaker 5>Hitler,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very creative person,</v>

1209
01:02:15.800 --> 01:02:17.890
<v Speaker 5>but also extremely orderly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1210
01:02:18.440 --> 01:02:22.890
<v Speaker 5>and I at the metaphors that he was using</v>
<v Speaker 5>to describe the Jews and the Gypsies and</v>

1211
01:02:22.891 --> 01:02:25.440
<v Speaker 5>all the other people that he burned and </v>
<v Speaker 5>destroyed.</v>

1212
01:02:25.441 --> 01:02:28.110
<v Speaker 5>And it was all pathogen.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's all pathogen metaphor.</v>

1213
01:02:28.710 --> 01:02:31.530
<v Speaker 5>The aryan race is a body.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a pure body.</v>

1214
01:02:31.620 --> 01:02:35.970
<v Speaker 5>The blood is pure,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that Jews are rats or insects or or lice</v>

1215
01:02:35.971 --> 01:02:40.971
<v Speaker 5>or disease and so are the Gypsies and </v>
<v Speaker 5>everyone else and they need to be </v>

1216
01:02:40.971 --> 01:02:43.530
<v Speaker 5>eradicated in burned out essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Here's something even more frightening.</v>

1217
01:02:43.531 --> 01:02:45.810
<v Speaker 5>So when,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when Hitler,</v>

1218
01:02:46.650 --> 01:02:51.370
<v Speaker 5>when Hitler took over Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he was kind of a public health freak and</v>

1219
01:02:51.380 --> 01:02:54.540
<v Speaker 5>he will also washed his hands a lot </v>
<v Speaker 5>every day and he was also a worshiper of</v>

1220
01:02:54.541 --> 01:02:59.541
<v Speaker 5>willpower,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so he was a really orderly guy and he </v>

1221
01:02:59.541 --> 01:03:03.741
<v Speaker 5>started this public health campaign in </v>
<v Speaker 5>Germany and he put together these vans </v>

1222
01:03:03.741 --> 01:03:06.450
<v Speaker 5>that would go around like screening </v>
<v Speaker 5>people for tuberculosis,</v>

1223
01:03:06.451 --> 01:03:08.070
<v Speaker 5>which you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is a perfectly fine idea,</v>

1224
01:03:08.310 --> 01:03:13.310
<v Speaker 5>but then they started a beautification </v>
<v Speaker 5>program of the factories because he </v>

1225
01:03:13.310 --> 01:03:13.740
<v Speaker 5>didn't like how messy the factories were</v>
<v Speaker 5>in Germany.</v>

1226
01:03:13.740 --> 01:03:18.740
<v Speaker 5>So we had people clean them up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sweep them out and plant flowers out </v>

1227
01:03:18.740 --> 01:03:21.660
<v Speaker 5>front and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and fumigate them for rats and insects,</v>

1228
01:03:21.690 --> 01:03:22.800
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Parasites.</v>

1229
01:03:23.070 --> 01:03:28.070
<v Speaker 5>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the Jews were always compared to </v>

1230
01:03:28.070 --> 01:03:29.391
<v Speaker 5>rats and insects as well.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They used cycle on b to do the </v>

1231
01:03:29.391 --> 01:03:30.340
<v Speaker 5>insecticide.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1232
01:03:30.360 --> 01:03:33.660
<v Speaker 5>it's like long b.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was the gas that was used in the,</v>

1233
01:03:33.810 --> 01:03:38.810
<v Speaker 5>in the death camps.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it went like pathogen insect rats </v>

1234
01:03:38.810 --> 01:03:40.800
<v Speaker 5>that it went into the silence,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1235
01:03:40.801 --> 01:03:45.801
<v Speaker 5>so.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that people who were mentally </v>

1236
01:03:45.801 --> 01:03:45.801
<v Speaker 5>deficient,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they were like parasites and rats,</v>

1237
01:03:45.801 --> 01:03:47.640
<v Speaker 5>and then it was Jews and Gypsies and </v>
<v Speaker 5>parasites and rats.</v>

1238
01:03:48.100 --> 01:03:49.890
<v Speaker 3>They were using Xy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Colombian nods,</v>

1239
01:03:49.900 --> 01:03:52.060
<v Speaker 3>icon a I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe,</v>

1240
01:03:52.061 --> 01:03:53.860
<v Speaker 3>they were using cycle and be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

1241
01:03:53.861 --> 01:03:58.861
<v Speaker 3>I know that the gas was Zike lawn or </v>
<v Speaker 3>there is icon a was the gas that was </v>

1242
01:03:58.861 --> 01:04:03.391
<v Speaker 3>formulated with a very extreme smell so </v>
<v Speaker 3>that people would smell it and know </v>

1243
01:04:03.391 --> 01:04:06.070
<v Speaker 3>because it was extremely toxic Zike on </v>
<v Speaker 3>be.</v>

1244
01:04:06.071 --> 01:04:11.071
<v Speaker 3>It all came from Fritz Harbor Harbor was</v>
<v Speaker 3>the guy created the harbor method of </v>

1245
01:04:11.071 --> 01:04:13.210
<v Speaker 3>extracting nitrogen from the oxygen that</v>
<v Speaker 3>we use for fertilizer today.</v>

1246
01:04:13.690 --> 01:04:18.690
<v Speaker 3>Harbor created Xy clon a and made it </v>
<v Speaker 3>extremely toxic smelling so that you </v>

1247
01:04:19.781 --> 01:04:24.781
<v Speaker 3>would know to avoid it Zyklon B,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that that whatever element was removed </v>

1248
01:04:25.270 --> 01:04:28.810
<v Speaker 3>from the area so that it would be used </v>
<v Speaker 3>in gas chambers.</v>

1249
01:04:28.811 --> 01:04:31.660
<v Speaker 3>They'd have no idea that they're being </v>
<v Speaker 3>gassed proper.</v>

1250
01:04:31.661 --> 01:04:36.661
<v Speaker 3>Who was a Jew,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ironically did not know that his Zyklon </v>

1251
01:04:36.661 --> 01:04:37.030
<v Speaker 3>a was eventually going to be used on his</v>
<v Speaker 3>own.</v>

1252
01:04:38.130 --> 01:04:38.530
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1253
01:04:38.531 --> 01:04:40.710
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I suspect they probably use cycle on a</v>

1254
01:04:41.290 --> 01:04:42.110
<v Speaker 5>locations,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1255
01:04:42.270 --> 01:04:43.740
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the thing is,</v>

1256
01:04:44.160 --> 01:04:45.380
<v Speaker 5>is that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1257
01:04:45.390 --> 01:04:48.180
<v Speaker 5>so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you said what's the biological basis and</v>

1258
01:04:48.181 --> 01:04:52.710
<v Speaker 5>the biological basis is that like we're </v>
<v Speaker 5>basically wired in some sense also to,</v>

1259
01:04:53.040 --> 01:04:56.310
<v Speaker 5>to for the domain of order or the domain</v>
<v Speaker 5>of chaos.</v>

1260
01:04:56.880 --> 01:04:59.310
<v Speaker 5>That's another way of thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The domain of order,</v>

1261
01:04:59.370 --> 01:05:04.370
<v Speaker 5>once again is where you are when what </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're doing is working because see,</v>

1262
01:05:05.371 --> 01:05:08.460
<v Speaker 5>because our,</v>
<v Speaker 5>our environment isn't just natural.</v>

1263
01:05:08.461 --> 01:05:10.980
<v Speaker 5>It's also social.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So not only do you have to deal with the</v>

1264
01:05:10.981 --> 01:05:14.460
<v Speaker 5>vagaries of the natural world properly </v>
<v Speaker 5>so that it gives you what you are aiming</v>

1265
01:05:14.461 --> 01:05:16.290
<v Speaker 5>at.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's how you know if you're right,</v>

1266
01:05:16.380 --> 01:05:21.380
<v Speaker 5>it gives you what aiming at but you have</v>
<v Speaker 5>to do it in a way that other people </v>

1267
01:05:21.380 --> 01:05:22.950
<v Speaker 5>approve of and support.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it's a very tight constraint.</v>

1268
01:05:22.980 --> 01:05:25.870
<v Speaker 5>We talked about that as a constraint on </v>
<v Speaker 5>the interpretation of the world,</v>

1269
01:05:26.380 --> 01:05:30.580
<v Speaker 5>but then now and then something happens </v>
<v Speaker 5>to disrupt that stability.</v>

1270
01:05:30.580 --> 01:05:35.580
<v Speaker 5>So that's like the white circle.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the black circle in the white </v>

1271
01:05:35.580 --> 01:05:35.650
<v Speaker 5>serpent,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the Yin Yang symbol.</v>

1272
01:05:35.710 --> 01:05:36.310
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how the,</v>

1273
01:05:36.430 --> 01:05:39.980
<v Speaker 5>how the white one that's order,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the white one has a black.in</v>

1274
01:05:39.981 --> 01:05:43.840
<v Speaker 5>it nets because chaos can come pouring </v>
<v Speaker 5>through into order at any moment and you</v>

1275
01:05:43.841 --> 01:05:48.841
<v Speaker 5>have a circuit that detects that and </v>
<v Speaker 5>that's the same circuit that detects </v>

1276
01:05:48.841 --> 01:05:50.890
<v Speaker 5>snakes or predators and that obviously </v>
<v Speaker 5>why wouldn't it be,</v>

1277
01:05:51.390 --> 01:05:56.390
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>an intruding force and intruding forest </v>

1278
01:05:56.390 --> 01:05:59.371
<v Speaker 5>has to be responded to right now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So there's a need for a demand </v>

1279
01:05:59.860 --> 01:06:02.440
<v Speaker 5>instantaneous response to sandy because </v>
<v Speaker 5>most,</v>

1280
01:06:02.470 --> 01:06:04.150
<v Speaker 5>like you were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of those kids,</v>

1281
01:06:04.390 --> 01:06:09.010
<v Speaker 5>like almost a unhuman or disassociative </v>
<v Speaker 5>sort of,</v>

1282
01:06:09.020 --> 01:06:12.850
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the ability to act almost as if like,</v>

1283
01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:16.850
<v Speaker 5>like something other than a person with </v>
<v Speaker 5>a humanization.</v>

1284
01:06:16.930 --> 01:06:18.120
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the Deq.</v>

1285
01:06:18.380 --> 01:06:21.040
<v Speaker 5>The thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is another thing that's so funny is that</v>

1286
01:06:22.210 --> 01:06:27.210
<v Speaker 5>we think that the natural response to </v>
<v Speaker 5>looking at a human being is </v>

1287
01:06:27.210 --> 01:06:27.210
<v Speaker 5>humanization.</v>

1288
01:06:27.210 --> 01:06:31.980
<v Speaker 5>And that isn't right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like the default person in some sense </v>

1289
01:06:31.980 --> 01:06:35.880
<v Speaker 5>isn't human.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The default member of your tribe is </v>

1290
01:06:35.880 --> 01:06:35.880
<v Speaker 5>human.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1291
01:06:35.880 --> 01:06:39.901
<v Speaker 5>most tribes around the world,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the name for their tribe is the people </v>

1292
01:06:39.901 --> 01:06:43.750
<v Speaker 5>implying that there are the people and </v>
<v Speaker 5>all those other things out there are </v>

1293
01:06:43.750 --> 01:06:47.461
<v Speaker 5>barbarians right there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There are forces of chaos are the </v>

1294
01:06:47.461 --> 01:06:48.760
<v Speaker 5>stranger,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they bring disease in trouble.</v>

1295
01:06:48.790 --> 01:06:53.790
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to be too bleak about it </v>

1296
01:06:53.790 --> 01:06:55.651
<v Speaker 5>because this is the basic debate between</v>
<v Speaker 5>conservatives and liberals to some </v>

1297
01:06:55.651 --> 01:07:00.271
<v Speaker 5>degree is the conservatives take the </v>
<v Speaker 5>stranger equals pathogen route more </v>

1298
01:07:01.451 --> 01:07:06.451
<v Speaker 5>frequently and they're less attracted to</v>
<v Speaker 5>the idea of the free of or they work </v>

1299
01:07:07.810 --> 01:07:12.640
<v Speaker 5>conventionally.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That trade with a foreigner has benefits</v>

1300
01:07:12.641 --> 01:07:17.641
<v Speaker 5>that outweigh the risks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And generally speaking,</v>

1301
01:07:18.731 --> 01:07:22.030
<v Speaker 5>liberals have the opposite attitude.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

1302
01:07:22.170 --> 01:07:24.550
<v Speaker 5>but that's because those two things are </v>
<v Speaker 5>both true.</v>

1303
01:07:24.940 --> 01:07:26.110
<v Speaker 5>One is that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

1304
01:07:26.111 --> 01:07:28.600
<v Speaker 5>it's really useful to trade with </v>
<v Speaker 5>strangers because they have all sorts of</v>

1305
01:07:28.601 --> 01:07:31.390
<v Speaker 5>cool things you don't have but be,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1306
01:07:31.391 --> 01:07:36.391
<v Speaker 5>it might be real dangerous because you </v>
<v Speaker 5>don't know what those things are </v>

1307
01:07:36.391 --> 01:07:36.391
<v Speaker 5>infected with.</v>

1308
01:07:36.391 --> 01:07:37.930
<v Speaker 5>Like realistically speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's say.</v>

1309
01:07:37.931 --> 01:07:41.870
<v Speaker 5>But then also metaphorically speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>here's an example of how,</v>

1310
01:07:41.920 --> 01:07:42.400
<v Speaker 5>how,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1311
01:07:43.380 --> 01:07:43.960
<v Speaker 5>how,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1312
01:07:44.140 --> 01:07:48.160
<v Speaker 5>an object can be a virus.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think about the automobile,</v>

1313
01:07:49.180 --> 01:07:54.180
<v Speaker 5>like if you wanted to introduce </v>
<v Speaker 5>something into a communist country that </v>

1314
01:07:54.180 --> 01:07:58.060
<v Speaker 5>screamed the paramount status of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>individual,</v>

1315
01:07:58.510 --> 01:08:03.510
<v Speaker 5>you couldn't possibly create something </v>
<v Speaker 5>that broadcast that more clearly than a </v>

1316
01:08:03.510 --> 01:08:04.510
<v Speaker 5>car.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

1317
01:08:04.540 --> 01:08:08.380
<v Speaker 5>The car is driven by one person.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The person is completely autonomous,</v>

1318
01:08:08.520 --> 01:08:13.520
<v Speaker 5>are completely sealed off.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They don't need any state support or </v>

1319
01:08:13.520 --> 01:08:14.890
<v Speaker 5>sanctioned whatsoever to move around in </v>
<v Speaker 5>the car.</v>

1320
01:08:15.230 --> 01:08:20.230
<v Speaker 5>It's like if you want to do in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you wanted to rescue the communists </v>

1321
01:08:20.301 --> 01:08:25.301
<v Speaker 5>from their collective pathology,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the best thing to do would be to </v>

1322
01:08:25.310 --> 01:08:30.310
<v Speaker 5>parachute in automobiles because the </v>
<v Speaker 5>automobile just screams individual </v>

1323
01:08:30.310 --> 01:08:34.301
<v Speaker 5>autonomy and so when you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you get a an artifact from a </v>

1324
01:08:34.301 --> 01:08:39.160
<v Speaker 5>foreigner,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't know what that's contaminated </v>

1325
01:08:39.160 --> 01:08:39.290
<v Speaker 5>with,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's put it that way.</v>

1326
01:08:39.710 --> 01:08:42.530
<v Speaker 5>And so we have a circuit for dealing </v>
<v Speaker 5>with that and it's a,</v>

1327
01:08:43.010 --> 01:08:48.010
<v Speaker 5>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's the thing that associates the </v>

1328
01:08:48.010 --> 01:08:51.080
<v Speaker 5>foreigner with the force that eats the </v>
<v Speaker 5>sun when it sets at night.</v>

1329
01:08:51.320 --> 01:08:53.510
<v Speaker 5>That's the most archaic way of thinking </v>
<v Speaker 5>about it,</v>

1330
01:08:53.720 --> 01:08:56.810
<v Speaker 5>but it's the snake or the Predator.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

1331
01:08:56.840 --> 01:08:58.640
<v Speaker 5>and what do you do with a snake or a </v>
<v Speaker 5>predator?</v>

1332
01:08:58.760 --> 01:08:59.810
<v Speaker 5>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you burn it,</v>

1333
01:09:00.170 --> 01:09:02.180
<v Speaker 5>you kill it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you crush it.</v>

1334
01:09:02.480 --> 01:09:07.480
<v Speaker 5>It's like there's a.</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a destructive force that comes </v>

1335
01:09:07.480 --> 01:09:07.480
<v Speaker 5>along with it with that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's absolutely.</v>

1336
01:09:07.480 --> 01:09:09.610
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's morally righteous because yeah,</v>

1337
01:09:10.220 --> 01:09:15.220
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if it's a poisonous snake and it's </v>

1338
01:09:15.220 --> 01:09:17.951
<v Speaker 5>threatening the village,</v>
<v Speaker 5>obviously you kill it and then you're </v>

1339
01:09:17.951 --> 01:09:20.681
<v Speaker 5>celebrated for it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So in a sense the same dehumanizing </v>

1340
01:09:20.681 --> 01:09:25.150
<v Speaker 5>force that allows people to act that way</v>
<v Speaker 5>in war also allows people to </v>

1341
01:09:25.731 --> 01:09:30.731
<v Speaker 5>disassociate between anyone who doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 5>agree with their ideology in a school </v>

1342
01:09:31.761 --> 01:09:36.761
<v Speaker 5>setting,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in a university like what happened at </v>

1343
01:09:36.761 --> 01:09:36.761
<v Speaker 5>Mclean.</v>

1344
01:09:36.761 --> 01:09:36.761
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's why.</v>

1345
01:09:36.761 --> 01:09:40.220
<v Speaker 5>That's why I don't like it ecologies </v>
<v Speaker 5>because the ideology does divides the </v>

1346
01:09:40.220 --> 01:09:44.831
<v Speaker 5>world into those safely ensconced within</v>
<v Speaker 5>our dominance hierarchy and serpents.</v>

1347
01:09:47.480 --> 01:09:49.880
<v Speaker 5>And so that's dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

1348
01:09:50.020 --> 01:09:55.020
<v Speaker 5>and the reason that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that this doctrine that I described </v>

1349
01:09:55.020 --> 01:09:55.670
<v Speaker 5>about the line between good and evil </v>
<v Speaker 5>running down the individual's heart.</v>

1350
01:09:55.671 --> 01:09:59.690
<v Speaker 5>I mean I got that particular line mostly</v>
<v Speaker 5>from Alexander Solzhenitsyn,</v>

1351
01:09:59.691 --> 01:10:01.280
<v Speaker 5>but it's also a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a,</v>

1352
01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:06.520
<v Speaker 5>it's an idea that's been developed </v>
<v Speaker 5>intensively in the West for thousands </v>

1353
01:10:06.520 --> 01:10:10.151
<v Speaker 5>and thousands of years.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe it's been developed since far </v>

1354
01:10:10.151 --> 01:10:13.571
<v Speaker 5>before we.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We invented the stories in genesis </v>

1355
01:10:13.571 --> 01:10:15.350
<v Speaker 5>because of course the serpent see in </v>
<v Speaker 5>genesis,</v>

1356
01:10:15.351 --> 01:10:17.630
<v Speaker 5>of course genesis is like a paradise,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right,</v>

1357
01:10:18.140 --> 01:10:20.720
<v Speaker 5>so you can think about it as a well </v>
<v Speaker 5>functioning hierarchy.</v>

1358
01:10:20.900 --> 01:10:23.000
<v Speaker 5>It's also a balance between chaos and </v>
<v Speaker 5>order.</v>

1359
01:10:23.001 --> 01:10:28.001
<v Speaker 5>It's got walls and it's a garden,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so but there's a snake that pops his </v>

1360
01:10:28.131 --> 01:10:30.020
<v Speaker 5>head in and that's the same as that.</v>

1361
01:10:30.620 --> 01:10:35.620
<v Speaker 5>As I said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that black dot inside the white serpent </v>

1362
01:10:35.620 --> 01:10:36.050
<v Speaker 5>in the union symbol,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's that no matter how,</v>

1363
01:10:36.090 --> 01:10:40.310
<v Speaker 5>doesn't matter how perfect the the </v>
<v Speaker 5>environment is set up,</v>

1364
01:10:40.760 --> 01:10:44.120
<v Speaker 5>something that doesn't fit is going to </v>
<v Speaker 5>make its way inside.</v>

1365
01:10:44.630 --> 01:10:47.150
<v Speaker 5>It's one of the oldest stories of of </v>
<v Speaker 5>mankind,</v>

1366
01:10:47.151 --> 01:10:52.151
<v Speaker 5>and you see the thing that makes itself </v>
<v Speaker 5>manifest inside in the genesis story is </v>

1367
01:10:52.371 --> 01:10:55.370
<v Speaker 5>a snake.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now that snake turns out to be Satan,</v>

1368
01:10:55.460 --> 01:10:57.200
<v Speaker 5>which is like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how the hell does that happen?</v>

1369
01:10:57.201 --> 01:10:57.980
<v Speaker 5>It's a snake.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

1370
01:10:58.010 --> 01:10:59.360
<v Speaker 5>what?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Where does that come from?</v>

1371
01:10:59.490 --> 01:11:02.030
<v Speaker 5>It's not actually in the biblical </v>
<v Speaker 5>writings to any degree.</v>

1372
01:11:02.031 --> 01:11:04.160
<v Speaker 5>It's part of the surrounding mythology.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1373
01:11:04.161 --> 01:11:08.360
<v Speaker 5>it's partly because people started to </v>
<v Speaker 5>figure out that the worst snake wasn't a</v>

1374
01:11:08.361 --> 01:11:13.361
<v Speaker 5>snake.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The worst snake was the snake that was </v>

1375
01:11:13.361 --> 01:11:16.631
<v Speaker 5>inside a person because a malevolent </v>
<v Speaker 5>person is way more of a threat than just</v>

1376
01:11:16.951 --> 01:11:18.720
<v Speaker 5>a snake,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a snake wants to bite unit,</v>

1377
01:11:18.721 --> 01:11:23.721
<v Speaker 5>wants to eat you and all of that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and and they were hell on are extremely </v>

1378
01:11:23.721 --> 01:11:25.860
<v Speaker 5>primordial ancestors,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but we're.</v>

1379
01:11:25.890 --> 01:11:30.000
<v Speaker 5>The human race has been trying to figure</v>
<v Speaker 5>out where the threat is forever.</v>

1380
01:11:30.150 --> 01:11:30.930
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>first of all,</v>

1381
01:11:30.931 --> 01:11:32.340
<v Speaker 5>it was external,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1382
01:11:32.341 --> 01:11:34.200
<v Speaker 5>It was all external.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was the snake.</v>

1383
01:11:34.201 --> 01:11:37.440
<v Speaker 5>It was the barbarian,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but then it got localized to some degree</v>

1384
01:11:37.441 --> 01:11:39.870
<v Speaker 5>inside the individual.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like that's a bad person.</v>

1385
01:11:40.050 --> 01:11:43.410
<v Speaker 5>That person has a snake in them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then the idea kind of came out.</v>

1386
01:11:43.411 --> 01:11:48.411
<v Speaker 5>This is so cool.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The idea is that while the snake that's </v>

1387
01:11:48.411 --> 01:11:51.141
<v Speaker 5>inside bad person a and the snake that's</v>
<v Speaker 5>inside bad person b is somehow the same.</v>

1388
01:11:51.900 --> 01:11:55.740
<v Speaker 5>So that's where the idea of an </v>
<v Speaker 5>articulated morality starts to come from</v>

1389
01:11:56.070 --> 01:11:58.740
<v Speaker 5>is there's an equivalence of evil across</v>
<v Speaker 5>individuals.</v>

1390
01:11:59.670 --> 01:12:03.690
<v Speaker 5>So then the idea of evil itself starts </v>
<v Speaker 5>to become abstracted to at the same time</v>

1391
01:12:03.691 --> 01:12:08.691
<v Speaker 5>that the idea of good does well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>evil gets associated with Satan and </v>

1392
01:12:08.691 --> 01:12:09.210
<v Speaker 5>Satan gets associated with the snake.</v>

1393
01:12:09.420 --> 01:12:11.670
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's mind boggling.</v>

1394
01:12:11.730 --> 01:12:14.330
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>these are how these chimps,</v>

1395
01:12:14.340 --> 01:12:16.140
<v Speaker 5>for Christ's sake,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1396
01:12:16.260 --> 01:12:19.440
<v Speaker 5>it took us a long time to develop up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>say an ideal,</v>

1397
01:12:19.441 --> 01:12:23.910
<v Speaker 5>just to say the word.</v>
<v Speaker 5>An ideal implies a counter ideal say,</v>

1398
01:12:24.030 --> 01:12:29.030
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>those things were embodied way before </v>

1399
01:12:29.030 --> 01:12:29.100
<v Speaker 5>they were ideas and after they were </v>
<v Speaker 5>embodied,</v>

1400
01:12:29.101 --> 01:12:30.570
<v Speaker 5>first,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not as bad,</v>

1401
01:12:30.571 --> 01:12:35.571
<v Speaker 5>but as a bad thing or a bad person,</v>
<v Speaker 5>bad had to be extracted out of that.</v>

1402
01:12:35.970 --> 01:12:39.000
<v Speaker 5>And even that was extracted as a drama </v>
<v Speaker 5>first.</v>

1403
01:12:39.410 --> 01:12:41.010
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like the bad guy in a movie.</v>

1404
01:12:41.070 --> 01:12:43.980
<v Speaker 5>He isn't a bad guy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's a composite bad guy.</v>

1405
01:12:44.460 --> 01:12:45.200
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he,</v>

1406
01:12:45.210 --> 01:12:48.780
<v Speaker 5>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's a literary bad guy and the good guy</v>

1407
01:12:48.781 --> 01:12:50.730
<v Speaker 5>isn't just a good guy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's a literary good guy.</v>

1408
01:12:50.760 --> 01:12:53.340
<v Speaker 5>He's a hero.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's got way more heroic attributes than</v>

1409
01:12:53.341 --> 01:12:58.341
<v Speaker 5>the typical person.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's where abstract ideas are </v>

1410
01:12:58.341 --> 01:12:58.341
<v Speaker 5>born.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So anyways,</v>

1411
01:12:58.341 --> 01:12:59.850
<v Speaker 5>back to your question,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the use,</v>

1412
01:13:00.490 --> 01:13:01.970
<v Speaker 5>you said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1413
01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:07.400
<v Speaker 5>what's the evolutionary basis for that </v>
<v Speaker 5>sort of dissociative behavior and </v>

1414
01:13:07.400 --> 01:13:07.400
<v Speaker 5>thinking?</v>

1415
01:13:07.400 --> 01:13:09.450
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so I'm afraid that that was a big rabbit</v>

1416
01:13:09.451 --> 01:13:09.960
<v Speaker 5>hole,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

1417
01:13:09.961 --> 01:13:14.961
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a great rabbit hole and it makes a </v>

1418
01:13:14.961 --> 01:13:14.961
<v Speaker 5>whole lot of sense that there's an </v>
<v Speaker 5>actual.</v>

1419
01:13:14.961 --> 01:13:19.450
<v Speaker 5>And I knew you probably knew this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is why I asked you that knew you </v>

1420
01:13:19.450 --> 01:13:23.031
<v Speaker 5>had an answer rather that there is some </v>
<v Speaker 5>sort of an evolutionary basis for that </v>

1421
01:13:23.031 --> 01:13:26.370
<v Speaker 5>sort of be that ability that people have</v>
<v Speaker 5>to look at someone as the other,</v>

1422
01:13:26.580 --> 01:13:31.580
<v Speaker 5>you bet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well also how the hell are you going to </v>

1423
01:13:31.580 --> 01:13:31.580
<v Speaker 5>respond in war if you don't have that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1424
01:13:31.580 --> 01:13:36.240
<v Speaker 5>Like that was always an issue with </v>
<v Speaker 5>people with invading tribes and like you</v>

1425
01:13:36.241 --> 01:13:38.040
<v Speaker 5>said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>with other external threats,</v>

1426
01:13:38.041 --> 01:13:41.580
<v Speaker 5>whether it was animals or insects or </v>
<v Speaker 5>snakes or anything,</v>

1427
01:13:41.581 --> 01:13:42.660
<v Speaker 5>they could kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1428
01:13:42.661 --> 01:13:43.560
<v Speaker 5>Well I mean in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in,</v>

1429
01:13:43.790 --> 01:13:48.790
<v Speaker 5>in a primordial situation,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean guys are in warrior mode a good </v>

1430
01:13:48.790 --> 01:13:50.790
<v Speaker 5>part of the time and modern people don't</v>
<v Speaker 5>even know what that's like.</v>

1431
01:13:50.850 --> 01:13:53.820
<v Speaker 5>That's why they go out and they go into </v>
<v Speaker 5>warrior mode and they get post traumatic</v>

1432
01:13:53.821 --> 01:13:58.160
<v Speaker 5>stress disorder because it's so unlike </v>
<v Speaker 5>the way they configure themselves that,</v>

1433
01:13:58.500 --> 01:14:03.500
<v Speaker 5>that they can't even,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they can't even bridged the gap between </v>

1434
01:14:03.500 --> 01:14:03.500
<v Speaker 5>the two identities and for,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1435
01:14:03.570 --> 01:14:06.030
<v Speaker 5>just for sake of clarity,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think for some folks,</v>

1436
01:14:06.540 --> 01:14:09.030
<v Speaker 5>posttraumatic stress disorder is </v>
<v Speaker 5>actually come from,</v>

1437
01:14:09.060 --> 01:14:11.620
<v Speaker 5>not just that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but also from the threat</v>

1438
01:14:12.130 --> 01:14:15.370
<v Speaker 3>of being attacked from what I </v>
<v Speaker 3>understand,</v>

1439
01:14:16.300 --> 01:14:21.300
<v Speaker 3>people like special ops people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people like rangers and Navy seals and </v>

1440
01:14:21.300 --> 01:14:26.281
<v Speaker 3>the like are less likely to develop </v>
<v Speaker 3>posttraumatic stress disorder because </v>

1441
01:14:26.281 --> 01:14:30.901
<v Speaker 3>they're acting versus reacting that </v>
<v Speaker 3>whereas people that are on that are </v>

1442
01:14:30.901 --> 01:14:32.410
<v Speaker 3>going on like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1443
01:14:32.470 --> 01:14:37.470
<v Speaker 3>patrol and then they get blown up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like those people apparently have a far </v>

1444
01:14:37.470 --> 01:14:42.240
<v Speaker 3>more likely issue with posttraumatic </v>
<v Speaker 3>stress disorder because they're </v>

1445
01:14:42.240 --> 01:14:42.520
<v Speaker 3>constantly worried about these external </v>
<v Speaker 3>threats.</v>

1446
01:14:42.940 --> 01:14:44.950
<v Speaker 3>And then they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they come back to civilization,</v>

1447
01:14:44.951 --> 01:14:47.950
<v Speaker 3>they have a very difficult time getting </v>
<v Speaker 3>back to baseline.</v>

1448
01:14:48.010 --> 01:14:49.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're in prey mode.</v>

1449
01:14:49.390 --> 01:14:51.520
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very serious way.</v>

1450
01:14:51.590 --> 01:14:52.260
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1451
01:14:52.370 --> 01:14:54.350
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's not just acting,</v>

1452
01:14:54.351 --> 01:14:59.351
<v Speaker 3>but it's also reacting that the reacting</v>
<v Speaker 3>issue sometimes is even more problematic</v>

1453
01:14:59.421 --> 01:15:01.250
<v Speaker 3>for the individual than the acting mode.</v>

1454
01:15:01.650 --> 01:15:02.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well there's,</v>

1455
01:15:02.390 --> 01:15:07.390
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a funny dichotomy there because </v>

1456
01:15:07.390 --> 01:15:07.950
<v Speaker 2>very frequently if you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>encounter a stress,</v>

1457
01:15:08.130 --> 01:15:13.130
<v Speaker 2>it's best to do it voluntarily because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you use a whole different circuit used </v>

1458
01:15:13.130 --> 01:15:13.500
<v Speaker 2>the approach circuit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

1459
01:15:13.920 --> 01:15:16.840
<v Speaker 2>I mean that sounds paradoxical what you </v>
<v Speaker 2>just said because I said that,</v>

1460
01:15:16.960 --> 01:15:21.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people often observe themselves doing </v>

1461
01:15:21.960 --> 01:15:21.960
<v Speaker 2>something to get posttraumatic stress </v>
<v Speaker 2>disorder and then you said,</v>

1462
01:15:21.960 --> 01:15:26.601
<v Speaker 2>well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if people act they're less likely </v>

1463
01:15:26.601 --> 01:15:28.551
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's part of a more general </v>

1464
01:15:28.551 --> 01:15:28.800
<v Speaker 2>phenomenon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is that in the face of a stressor,</v>

1465
01:15:29.330 --> 01:15:34.330
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're better off cycle physiologically </v>

1466
01:15:34.330 --> 01:15:36.771
<v Speaker 2>to act voluntarily.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's either you're either going to be </v>

1467
01:15:36.771 --> 01:15:39.600
<v Speaker 2>the thing that advances on the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the anomaly or its prey.</v>

1468
01:15:39.720 --> 01:15:42.510
<v Speaker 2>Now that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's roughly the way to think about it</v>

1469
01:15:42.511 --> 01:15:47.250
<v Speaker 2>and to be a prey animal is a terrible </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing because it's doom.</v>

1470
01:15:47.610 --> 01:15:49.710
<v Speaker 2>It's paralysis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like literally speaking.</v>

1471
01:15:49.740 --> 01:15:52.500
<v Speaker 2>It's like in the Harry Potter series </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the basketball is Greg,</v>

1472
01:15:52.530 --> 01:15:54.540
<v Speaker 2>you look at the basilisk and it turns </v>
<v Speaker 2>you to stone.</v>

1473
01:15:54.750 --> 01:15:55.410
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>

1474
01:15:56.370 --> 01:16:01.370
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because that's what happens to a prey </v>

1475
01:16:01.370 --> 01:16:01.370
<v Speaker 2>animal when a horrible Predator looks at</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1476
01:16:01.370 --> 01:16:02.550
<v Speaker 2>it's frozen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's turned into stone.</v>

1477
01:16:02.640 --> 01:16:04.720
<v Speaker 2>That's Medusa with all her snakes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1478
01:16:05.160 --> 01:16:06.210
<v Speaker 2>She looks at you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1479
01:16:06.211 --> 01:16:11.211
<v Speaker 2>Mother Nature looks at you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The the like the devouring part of </v>

1480
01:16:11.211 --> 01:16:13.530
<v Speaker 2>Mother Nature opens her eye on you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you're paralyzed.</v>

1481
01:16:13.830 --> 01:16:15.180
<v Speaker 2>That's an old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>old story.</v>

1482
01:16:15.660 --> 01:16:16.070
<v Speaker 2>That is</v>

1483
01:16:16.210 --> 01:16:19.960
<v Speaker 3>really interesting thing that I never </v>
<v Speaker 3>considered that my medusa does have this</v>

1484
01:16:19.961 --> 01:16:23.650
<v Speaker 3>head of snakes and she looks at you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she turns you into stone and that is the</v>

1485
01:16:23.651 --> 01:16:26.800
<v Speaker 3>biggest issue with people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not fight or flight.</v>

1486
01:16:27.340 --> 01:16:29.290
<v Speaker 3>People think it's fight or flight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fight,</v>

1487
01:16:29.320 --> 01:16:34.320
<v Speaker 3>flight or freeze.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The freeze thing is very common with </v>

1488
01:16:34.320 --> 01:16:35.070
<v Speaker 3>people and I've seen it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've seen it with people that just.</v>

1489
01:16:35.220 --> 01:16:40.220
<v Speaker 3>They don't know what to do when they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>in a stressful situation and instead of </v>

1490
01:16:40.220 --> 01:16:40.240
<v Speaker 3>reacting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they freak out.</v>

1491
01:16:40.350 --> 01:16:41.190
<v Speaker 2>Yup,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

1492
01:16:41.250 --> 01:16:44.470
<v Speaker 2>They freak out or they freeze so they </v>
<v Speaker 2>just lock.</v>

1493
01:16:44.600 --> 01:16:49.600
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can see that if we go back to that </v>

1494
01:16:49.600 --> 01:16:51.381
<v Speaker 2>example of say someone tells a joke,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe they're kind of socially anxious </v>

1495
01:16:51.381 --> 01:16:53.130
<v Speaker 2>and they finally managed to mumble out a</v>
<v Speaker 2>joke and it falls flat.</v>

1496
01:16:53.460 --> 01:16:58.460
<v Speaker 2>It's like to freeze.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The interface of that is very common </v>

1497
01:16:58.460 --> 01:16:58.800
<v Speaker 2>reaction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know the personal freeze.</v>

1498
01:16:58.801 --> 01:17:02.550
<v Speaker 2>Then often they'll break into tears and </v>
<v Speaker 2>run so well.</v>

1499
01:17:02.551 --> 01:17:07.551
<v Speaker 2>If they're socially anxious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's exactly what's happened because </v>

1500
01:17:07.551 --> 01:17:09.320
<v Speaker 2>they've now they also know that they've </v>
<v Speaker 2>been turned into a Predator,</v>

1501
01:17:09.321 --> 01:17:14.321
<v Speaker 2>let's say a snake Predator by the whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>community and that's very shaming and so</v>

1502
01:17:15.020 --> 01:17:15.510
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1503
01:17:15.570 --> 01:17:17.810
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is dumped on top of them.</v>

1504
01:17:18.040 --> 01:17:20.810
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's socially anxious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are afraid of that all the time,</v>

1505
01:17:21.200 --> 01:17:23.660
<v Speaker 2>that they're going to be regarded by the</v>
<v Speaker 2>group as an outcast.</v>

1506
01:17:23.900 --> 01:17:24.810
<v Speaker 2>Pariah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

1507
01:17:25.470 --> 01:17:30.470
<v Speaker 2>and it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very hard on people and the </v>

1508
01:17:30.470 --> 01:17:32.531
<v Speaker 2>paranoid amongst them are always </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking that people are talking about </v>

1509
01:17:32.531 --> 01:17:32.531
<v Speaker 2>them and trying to make them the other.</v>

1510
01:17:32.531 --> 01:17:33.620
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1511
01:17:34.160 --> 01:17:36.470
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A very uncomfortable state of mind.</v>

1512
01:17:37.370 --> 01:17:38.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a very.</v>

1513
01:17:38.930 --> 01:17:43.130
<v Speaker 2>I think this is a very important subject</v>
<v Speaker 2>and explaining it this way.</v>

1514
01:17:43.131 --> 01:17:46.730
<v Speaker 2>I think for the openminded,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoever is willing to listen to this,</v>

1515
01:17:46.731 --> 01:17:50.120
<v Speaker 2>who maybe might have opposed some of </v>
<v Speaker 2>your ideas before,</v>

1516
01:17:50.121 --> 01:17:53.390
<v Speaker 2>I think they'll get a better </v>
<v Speaker 2>understanding of what's really dangerous</v>

1517
01:17:53.391 --> 01:17:58.391
<v Speaker 2>about this lack of dialogue and this </v>
<v Speaker 2>lack of engaging in this shutting you </v>

1518
01:17:58.391 --> 01:18:01.370
<v Speaker 2>out and making you the other as it were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1519
01:18:01.371 --> 01:18:06.371
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's what postmodernism is </v>

1520
01:18:06.371 --> 01:18:06.371
<v Speaker 2>fundamentally concerned about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't believe there's any other way</v>

1521
01:18:06.371 --> 01:18:08.120
<v Speaker 2>of operating in the world in that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>see in,</v>

1522
01:18:08.660 --> 01:18:13.660
<v Speaker 2>and this is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is one of the things that I think </v>

1523
01:18:13.660 --> 01:18:14.990
<v Speaker 2>Western civilization has contributed so </v>
<v Speaker 2>brilliantly to,</v>

1524
01:18:15.470 --> 01:18:18.860
<v Speaker 2>to the expansion of knowledge and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world is,</v>

1525
01:18:19.050 --> 01:18:19.790
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the.</v>

1526
01:18:20.090 --> 01:18:23.030
<v Speaker 2>What's the cure for the inadequacies of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the group?</v>

1527
01:18:23.960 --> 01:18:26.090
<v Speaker 2>While you might say it's the perfect </v>
<v Speaker 2>state,</v>

1528
01:18:26.390 --> 01:18:30.260
<v Speaker 2>so one of the ways I'm going to do a </v>
<v Speaker 2>series of lectures on the Bible starting</v>

1529
01:18:30.261 --> 01:18:35.261
<v Speaker 2>May 16th and for reasons that I outlined</v>
<v Speaker 2>to some degree when I was talking about </v>

1530
01:18:35.261 --> 01:18:38.450
<v Speaker 2>genesis a little bit earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in the old testament for example,</v>

1531
01:18:38.840 --> 01:18:43.840
<v Speaker 2>the Israelites are always trying to make</v>
<v Speaker 2>their peace with God so they're trying </v>

1532
01:18:43.840 --> 01:18:47.021
<v Speaker 2>to live in the world without getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>walloped constantly by natural events </v>

1533
01:18:47.021 --> 01:18:49.010
<v Speaker 2>and by you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>invading forces and which they attribute</v>

1534
01:18:49.011 --> 01:18:49.910
<v Speaker 2>to God's will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

1535
01:18:49.911 --> 01:18:52.160
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whatever's beyond their understanding.</v>

1536
01:18:52.161 --> 01:18:55.100
<v Speaker 2>In some sense they're more sophisticated</v>
<v Speaker 2>than merely this,</v>

1537
01:18:55.101 --> 01:18:57.200
<v Speaker 2>but whatever's beyond their </v>
<v Speaker 2>understanding,</v>

1538
01:18:57.410 --> 01:19:02.410
<v Speaker 2>but they're kind of conceptualizing </v>
<v Speaker 2>being as such and trying to figure out </v>

1539
01:19:02.410 --> 01:19:06.161
<v Speaker 2>how to deal with it and one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hypothesis they come up with is </v>

1540
01:19:06.161 --> 01:19:06.161
<v Speaker 2>something like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1541
01:19:06.161 --> 01:19:08.660
<v Speaker 2>you can bargain with it and the thing is</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can.</v>

1542
01:19:08.750 --> 01:19:13.750
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the things that's so cool </v>
<v Speaker 2>and partly the reason you can bargain </v>

1543
01:19:13.750 --> 01:19:17.411
<v Speaker 2>with reality is because the reality that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you encounter as you move forward in </v>

1544
01:19:17.571 --> 01:19:22.340
<v Speaker 2>time is partly the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but partly the abstract social system.</v>

1545
01:19:22.940 --> 01:19:27.350
<v Speaker 2>And so you can bargain with the future </v>
<v Speaker 2>abstract social system all the time.</v>

1546
01:19:27.351 --> 01:19:29.090
<v Speaker 2>You do that every time you make a </v>
<v Speaker 2>promise,</v>

1547
01:19:29.450 --> 01:19:32.360
<v Speaker 2>you do it every time you sacrifice one </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing for another.</v>

1548
01:19:32.590 --> 01:19:37.590
<v Speaker 2>So you forego an impulsive temptation </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that gives you a moral claim that </v>

1549
01:19:37.761 --> 01:19:40.040
<v Speaker 2>you can redeem in the future that </v>
<v Speaker 2>happens,</v>

1550
01:19:40.041 --> 01:19:41.990
<v Speaker 2>all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what money is for God's sake.</v>

1551
01:19:41.991 --> 01:19:45.170
<v Speaker 2>And we discovered the future at some </v>
<v Speaker 2>point,</v>

1552
01:19:45.500 --> 01:19:46.970
<v Speaker 2>as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were chimpanzees.</v>

1553
01:19:46.971 --> 01:19:48.470
<v Speaker 2>At one point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we discovered the future.</v>

1554
01:19:48.471 --> 01:19:53.471
<v Speaker 2>Then we discovered that you could </v>
<v Speaker 2>bargain with the future as if it was a </v>

1555
01:19:53.471 --> 01:19:54.470
<v Speaker 2>person that's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing.</v>

1556
01:19:54.500 --> 01:19:57.530
<v Speaker 2>And that's partly where the idea of God </v>
<v Speaker 2>as a personality came from.</v>

1557
01:19:57.770 --> 01:20:02.770
<v Speaker 2>I should flip that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that idea that you could bargain with </v>

1558
01:20:02.770 --> 01:20:07.330
<v Speaker 2>the future came out of the idea that God</v>
<v Speaker 2>was a personality because the God as a </v>

1559
01:20:07.330 --> 01:20:08.130
<v Speaker 2>personality idea came first.</v>

1560
01:20:08.310 --> 01:20:08.780
<v Speaker 5>But it was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1561
01:20:08.910 --> 01:20:09.360
<v Speaker 5>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1562
01:20:09.660 --> 01:20:14.660
<v Speaker 5>it was a developmental stage on the way </v>
<v Speaker 5>to even being able to say the future.</v>

1563
01:20:15.770 --> 01:20:16.330
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we,</v>

1564
01:20:16.340 --> 01:20:21.340
<v Speaker 5>we have no idea how to say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a 6 million year path from </v>

1565
01:20:21.340 --> 01:20:22.800
<v Speaker 5>chimpanzee to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to self aware human being.</v>

1566
01:20:23.430 --> 01:20:24.510
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and we don't,</v>

1567
01:20:24.511 --> 01:20:29.511
<v Speaker 5>we have no idea where these unbelievably</v>
<v Speaker 5>sophisticated ideas that we have come </v>

1568
01:20:29.511 --> 01:20:29.880
<v Speaker 5>from,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like the idea of sacrifice.</v>

1569
01:20:30.030 --> 01:20:35.030
<v Speaker 5>Do you know how much blood was spilled </v>
<v Speaker 5>before human beings were able to </v>

1570
01:20:35.030 --> 01:20:37.230
<v Speaker 5>sacrifice abstractly instead of killing </v>
<v Speaker 5>something?</v>

1571
01:20:37.680 --> 01:20:41.790
<v Speaker 5>We had to act out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>God enjoys you killing something because</v>

1572
01:20:41.940 --> 01:20:46.940
<v Speaker 5>he's happy with the blood.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We had to act that out for God who </v>

1573
01:20:46.940 --> 01:20:47.400
<v Speaker 5>knows?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Twenty thousand years,</v>

1574
01:20:47.550 --> 01:20:52.550
<v Speaker 5>100,000</v>
<v Speaker 5>years before we got anywhere near the </v>

1575
01:20:52.550 --> 01:20:55.431
<v Speaker 5>idea that you could do that abstractly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So when I look at these old stories,</v>

1576
01:20:56.041 --> 01:20:58.830
<v Speaker 5>I look at them like an evolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 5>biologist.</v>

1577
01:20:58.920 --> 01:21:03.920
<v Speaker 5>Now I'm not trying to reduce them in any</v>
<v Speaker 5>way because what we don't understand </v>

1578
01:21:03.920 --> 01:21:05.340
<v Speaker 5>about evolution that could make a very </v>
<v Speaker 5>thick book.</v>

1579
01:21:05.670 --> 01:21:10.670
<v Speaker 5>And there's other strange things about </v>
<v Speaker 5>religious phenomenology that we don't </v>

1580
01:21:10.670 --> 01:21:10.740
<v Speaker 5>have a clue about.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1581
01:21:10.741 --> 01:21:13.950
<v Speaker 5>like the fact that the drugs often </v>
<v Speaker 5>called entheogens.</v>

1582
01:21:14.040 --> 01:21:18.450
<v Speaker 5>Psychedelics can reliably produce </v>
<v Speaker 5>mystical experiences like no one has any</v>

1583
01:21:18.451 --> 01:21:21.180
<v Speaker 5>idea what to make of that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can just discounted.</v>

1584
01:21:21.240 --> 01:21:21.810
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1585
01:21:21.811 --> 01:21:23.430
<v Speaker 5>well they're drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1586
01:21:23.460 --> 01:21:28.460
<v Speaker 5>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People been using the things for who </v>

1587
01:21:28.460 --> 01:21:28.460
<v Speaker 5>knows,</v>
<v Speaker 5>50,000</v>

1588
01:21:28.460 --> 01:21:29.430
<v Speaker 5>years.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One hundred and 50,000</v>

1589
01:21:29.431 --> 01:21:34.431
<v Speaker 5>years,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they might be the source of all our </v>

1590
01:21:34.431 --> 01:21:34.431
<v Speaker 5>religious ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't.</v>

1591
01:21:34.431 --> 01:21:38.300
<v Speaker 5>I'm not saying that they are,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they could well be and so why do we </v>

1592
01:21:38.300 --> 01:21:41.900
<v Speaker 5>have a capacity for mystical experience?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Who knows it?</v>

1593
01:21:41.970 --> 01:21:44.070
<v Speaker 5>It's it's associated with a sense of </v>
<v Speaker 5>awe.</v>

1594
01:21:44.071 --> 01:21:49.071
<v Speaker 5>It's associated with the same feeling </v>
<v Speaker 5>that you get when you listen to </v>

1595
01:21:49.071 --> 01:21:51.981
<v Speaker 5>particularly dramatic music or when or </v>
<v Speaker 5>when something moves you deeply and you </v>

1596
01:21:52.411 --> 01:21:54.480
<v Speaker 5>know the hair on the back of your neck </v>
<v Speaker 5>stands up.</v>

1597
01:21:54.480 --> 01:21:56.640
<v Speaker 5>You know what that is?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's Pilau erection.</v>

1598
01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:02.000
<v Speaker 5>That's the same thing that happens to a </v>
<v Speaker 5>cat when it looks at a particularly big </v>

1599
01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:05.001
<v Speaker 5>dog.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's all you feel that when there's a </v>

1600
01:22:05.001 --> 01:22:06.750
<v Speaker 5>swell of music off,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're the hair stands up on the back of</v>

1601
01:22:06.751 --> 01:22:11.751
<v Speaker 5>your neck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like you pop up just like a cat </v>

1602
01:22:11.751 --> 01:22:13.821
<v Speaker 5>except like a bald cat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So what do you make of this idea that,</v>

1603
01:22:14.701 --> 01:22:15.690
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not the idea,</v>

1604
01:22:15.691 --> 01:22:20.190
<v Speaker 5>but the reality that these entheogens </v>
<v Speaker 5>closely mimic human neurochemistry,</v>

1605
01:22:20.400 --> 01:22:23.000
<v Speaker 5>know what they do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's absolutely no doubt about it.</v>

1606
01:22:23.070 --> 01:22:24.690
<v Speaker 5>What do you think the reason for that </v>
<v Speaker 5>is?</v>

1607
01:22:25.370 --> 01:22:26.720
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a part of the reason is,</v>

1608
01:22:26.721 --> 01:22:30.450
<v Speaker 5>is that we share an evolutionary pathway</v>
<v Speaker 5>with all these things that we eat,</v>

1609
01:22:30.810 --> 01:22:33.270
<v Speaker 5>plants and fungi,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you know,</v>

1610
01:22:33.360 --> 01:22:35.090
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're,</v>

1611
01:22:35.091 --> 01:22:38.820
<v Speaker 5>we're linked evolutionarily to every </v>
<v Speaker 5>form of life on the planet,</v>

1612
01:22:38.850 --> 01:22:39.700
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

1613
01:22:39.840 --> 01:22:44.840
<v Speaker 5>and like Serotonin in lobsters has the </v>
<v Speaker 5>same effect on lobsters as it does on </v>

1614
01:22:45.730 --> 01:22:46.350
<v Speaker 5>human being.</v>

1615
01:22:46.350 --> 01:22:48.780
<v Speaker 5>So if you up their serotonin levels </v>
<v Speaker 5>artificially,</v>

1616
01:22:48.781 --> 01:22:52.350
<v Speaker 5>the lobster gets,</v>
<v Speaker 5>stands up more erect and stronger and as</v>

1617
01:22:52.351 --> 01:22:55.790
<v Speaker 5>much more willing to fight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And if you decrease the serotonin in the</v>

1618
01:22:55.791 --> 01:22:56.850
<v Speaker 5>lobsters,</v>
<v Speaker 5>nervous system,</v>

1619
01:22:56.851 --> 01:22:59.770
<v Speaker 5>then it gets all depressed and runs away</v>
<v Speaker 5>and hides things.</v>

1620
01:23:00.200 --> 01:23:01.260
<v Speaker 5>Think about that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1621
01:23:01.261 --> 01:23:06.261
<v Speaker 5>we,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we split off from lobster about 350 </v>

1622
01:23:06.261 --> 01:23:06.670
<v Speaker 5>million years ago and still live in </v>
<v Speaker 5>dominance hierarchies.</v>

1623
01:23:07.120 --> 01:23:08.890
<v Speaker 5>That's how old the dominance hierarchy </v>
<v Speaker 5>is.</v>

1624
01:23:09.630 --> 01:23:12.790
<v Speaker 5>There's plan that's older than trees.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's older than flowers.</v>

1625
01:23:13.390 --> 01:23:14.410
<v Speaker 5>It's permanent,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1626
01:23:14.500 --> 01:23:18.610
<v Speaker 5>We've evolved for the hierarchy and in </v>
<v Speaker 5>the spirit of the hierarchy,</v>

1627
01:23:18.611 --> 01:23:20.620
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's the Old Testament God,</v>

1628
01:23:20.621 --> 01:23:23.200
<v Speaker 5>that's at least part of it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the spirit of the hierarchy.</v>

1629
01:23:24.190 --> 01:23:27.130
<v Speaker 5>So these things are,</v>
<v Speaker 5>while they're mind boggling to me,</v>

1630
01:23:27.131 --> 01:23:28.870
<v Speaker 5>which is partly why I'm investigating </v>
<v Speaker 5>them,</v>

1631
01:23:29.260 --> 01:23:31.390
<v Speaker 5>but all of our wiring is conditional on </v>
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

1632
01:23:32.110 --> 01:23:35.170
<v Speaker 5>So what I mean women use the dominance </v>
<v Speaker 5>hierarchy to select mates.</v>

1633
01:23:35.320 --> 01:23:39.730
<v Speaker 5>So it's so strange because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people think of evolution from a natural</v>

1634
01:23:39.731 --> 01:23:44.020
<v Speaker 5>selection perspective almost always,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but sexual selection plays a huge role.</v>

1635
01:23:44.021 --> 01:23:46.210
<v Speaker 5>So here all layout something wild for </v>
<v Speaker 5>you.</v>

1636
01:23:46.211 --> 01:23:51.211
<v Speaker 5>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So we know that you have twice as many </v>

1637
01:23:51.490 --> 01:23:55.540
<v Speaker 5>female ancestors as male ancestors.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now people have a hard time with that,</v>

1638
01:23:55.541 --> 01:23:58.630
<v Speaker 5>but you could imagine that roughly </v>
<v Speaker 5>speaking,</v>

1639
01:23:58.631 --> 01:24:03.631
<v Speaker 5>that would happen if every single woman </v>
<v Speaker 5>had one baby and only every second man </v>

1640
01:24:03.631 --> 01:24:05.170
<v Speaker 5>fathered a child.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So for men it would be,</v>

1641
01:24:05.380 --> 01:24:07.810
<v Speaker 5>you either have two kids are zero.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1642
01:24:07.811 --> 01:24:10.090
<v Speaker 5>that's basically what it is on average </v>
<v Speaker 5>across type.</v>

1643
01:24:10.420 --> 01:24:12.040
<v Speaker 5>If you're a man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have two children,</v>

1644
01:24:12.220 --> 01:24:15.490
<v Speaker 5>maybe with two different women or zero.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you're a woman,</v>

1645
01:24:15.580 --> 01:24:17.740
<v Speaker 5>everyone has one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's how it averages out.</v>

1646
01:24:18.130 --> 01:24:22.150
<v Speaker 5>So there's more disparity of success </v>
<v Speaker 5>among men.</v>

1647
01:24:22.151 --> 01:24:24.280
<v Speaker 5>And that's very common in the animal </v>
<v Speaker 5>kingdom by the way.</v>

1648
01:24:24.850 --> 01:24:27.970
<v Speaker 5>Now the question is how to women select </v>
<v Speaker 5>their mates?</v>

1649
01:24:28.420 --> 01:24:30.430
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>unlike female chimps,</v>

1650
01:24:30.460 --> 01:24:34.840
<v Speaker 5>female humans are choosy maters.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Female chimps will meet with any chimp.</v>

1651
01:24:35.440 --> 01:24:37.060
<v Speaker 5>They go into heat,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they'll meet with any chimp.</v>

1652
01:24:37.450 --> 01:24:39.340
<v Speaker 5>The dominant males are more likely to </v>
<v Speaker 5>mate with them,</v>

1653
01:24:39.341 --> 01:24:41.190
<v Speaker 5>but that's because they chase away the </v>
<v Speaker 5>subordinates.</v>

1654
01:24:41.380 --> 01:24:43.360
<v Speaker 5>It's not because the females exercise </v>
<v Speaker 5>choice,</v>

1655
01:24:43.510 --> 01:24:48.510
<v Speaker 5>human females exercise choice,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and that's one of the things that </v>

1656
01:24:48.510 --> 01:24:50.050
<v Speaker 5>differentiated us from chimpanzees,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but how do they do it?</v>

1657
01:24:50.590 --> 01:24:55.590
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they look at the male dominance </v>

1658
01:24:55.590 --> 01:24:55.590
<v Speaker 5>hierarchy and that's where the men are </v>
<v Speaker 5>competing.</v>

1659
01:24:55.590 --> 01:24:57.580
<v Speaker 5>Now you could say they're competing for </v>
<v Speaker 5>power,</v>

1660
01:24:57.940 --> 01:25:01.360
<v Speaker 5>but that's pretty corrupt way of looking</v>
<v Speaker 5>at it like they're competing for,</v>

1661
01:25:01.361 --> 01:25:06.361
<v Speaker 5>let's say influence.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're competing for leadership and so </v>

1662
01:25:06.361 --> 01:25:08.500
<v Speaker 5>in some sense the people at the top of </v>
<v Speaker 5>the hierarchy,</v>

1663
01:25:08.501 --> 01:25:10.720
<v Speaker 5>if they're men,</v>
<v Speaker 5>are elected by the other band.</v>

1664
01:25:10.780 --> 01:25:13.810
<v Speaker 5>Now I know there was brutes and there's </v>
<v Speaker 5>predators and all of that,</v>

1665
01:25:13.811 --> 01:25:16.360
<v Speaker 5>but I'm talking on average across time.</v>

1666
01:25:16.720 --> 01:25:21.720
<v Speaker 5>It's like the men organized themselves </v>
<v Speaker 5>and there are influential men that rise </v>

1667
01:25:21.720 --> 01:25:24.940
<v Speaker 5>to the top and the women take them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now we think about that.</v>

1668
01:25:25.270 --> 01:25:30.270
<v Speaker 5>What that means is that over the </v>
<v Speaker 5>millions of years that a dominance </v>

1669
01:25:30.270 --> 01:25:33.190
<v Speaker 5>hierarchy with those properties existed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So let's say since we split from chimps,</v>

1670
01:25:33.191 --> 01:25:38.191
<v Speaker 5>let's say that 6 million years,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that means that the male dominance </v>

1671
01:25:38.191 --> 01:25:42.601
<v Speaker 5>hierarchy is the environment that pushes</v>
<v Speaker 5>the mating mail to the top.</v>

1672
01:25:43.210 --> 01:25:47.440
<v Speaker 5>So that means the mail that's most </v>
<v Speaker 5>likely to take precedence in the dorm in</v>

1673
01:25:47.441 --> 01:25:52.441
<v Speaker 5>the male dominance hierarchy is the one </v>
<v Speaker 5>most likely to leave a genetic </v>

1674
01:25:52.441 --> 01:25:55.620
<v Speaker 5>contribution.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that means that the male dominance </v>

1675
01:25:55.620 --> 01:25:58.321
<v Speaker 5>hierarchies,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a selection mechanism mediated by the </v>

1676
01:25:58.321 --> 01:26:01.081
<v Speaker 5>female.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So what that means is that as we've </v>

1677
01:26:01.081 --> 01:26:02.200
<v Speaker 5>moved forward through 6 million years of</v>
<v Speaker 5>time,</v>

1678
01:26:02.740 --> 01:26:05.000
<v Speaker 5>men have become more and more well </v>
<v Speaker 5>adopted,</v>

1679
01:26:05.001 --> 01:26:07.550
<v Speaker 5>not only to the presence of the male </v>
<v Speaker 5>dominance hierarchy,</v>

1680
01:26:07.760 --> 01:26:09.390
<v Speaker 5>but to the ability to move up it.</v>

1681
01:26:10.280 --> 01:26:12.980
<v Speaker 5>And that's the central spirit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You could say in some sense,</v>

1682
01:26:13.010 --> 01:26:14.810
<v Speaker 5>that's the central spirit of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>individual.</v>

1683
01:26:15.110 --> 01:26:17.120
<v Speaker 5>The individual is the thing that can </v>
<v Speaker 5>move up.</v>

1684
01:26:17.121 --> 01:26:20.030
<v Speaker 5>Dominance hierarchies.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's the thing that's at the top.</v>

1685
01:26:20.890 --> 01:26:24.440
<v Speaker 5>It's the eye at the top of the pyramid </v>
<v Speaker 5>and it's been selected for.</v>

1686
01:26:24.800 --> 01:26:29.800
<v Speaker 5>And then what's happened is we've </v>
<v Speaker 5>watched so we get better and better and </v>

1687
01:26:29.800 --> 01:26:33.491
<v Speaker 5>better for biological reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 5>culturally mediated at figuring out how </v>

1688
01:26:34.371 --> 01:26:39.371
<v Speaker 5>to climb across a set of dominance </v>
<v Speaker 5>hierarchy so we can leave a genetic </v>

1689
01:26:39.371 --> 01:26:39.890
<v Speaker 5>contribution.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what's happened to human beings.</v>

1690
01:26:40.190 --> 01:26:42.950
<v Speaker 5>Now imagine that that's happened for 6 </v>
<v Speaker 5>million years.</v>

1691
01:26:43.190 --> 01:26:48.190
<v Speaker 5>So now imagine that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We started to watch that because we're </v>

1692
01:26:48.190 --> 01:26:48.590
<v Speaker 5>curious creatures.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're always trying to figure out who we</v>

1693
01:26:48.591 --> 01:26:51.800
<v Speaker 5>are.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then as we watched that,</v>

1694
01:26:51.801 --> 01:26:56.801
<v Speaker 5>we started to tell stories about what </v>
<v Speaker 5>the people who could climb the </v>

1695
01:26:56.801 --> 01:26:57.050
<v Speaker 5>hierarchies were like those were heroes.</v>

1696
01:26:57.450 --> 01:27:02.450
<v Speaker 5>That's where Harold mythology came from.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the biggest hero is the person will </v>

1697
01:27:02.450 --> 01:27:02.810
<v Speaker 5>go out and killed a snake.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1698
01:27:02.811 --> 01:27:05.870
<v Speaker 5>unsurprisingly,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because that was a big hero man.</v>

1699
01:27:06.710 --> 01:27:09.170
<v Speaker 5>And maybe when we living in trees,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that was a hero.</v>

1700
01:27:09.980 --> 01:27:12.530
<v Speaker 5>So the big hero is the person who goes </v>
<v Speaker 5>out,</v>

1701
01:27:12.680 --> 01:27:14.810
<v Speaker 5>slays the dragon,</v>
<v Speaker 5>gets the gold,</v>

1702
01:27:14.840 --> 01:27:16.850
<v Speaker 5>brings it back to the community and </v>
<v Speaker 5>distributed.</v>

1703
01:27:17.030 --> 01:27:19.880
<v Speaker 5>He's also the person most likely to go </v>
<v Speaker 5>up the dominant Turkey.</v>

1704
01:27:20.330 --> 01:27:22.520
<v Speaker 5>He's the person most likely to find the </v>
<v Speaker 5>virgin,</v>

1705
01:27:22.760 --> 01:27:24.650
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because it's a virgin that you free from</v>

1706
01:27:24.651 --> 01:27:27.800
<v Speaker 5>the dragon and you get to claim her </v>
<v Speaker 5>right,</v>

1707
01:27:28.700 --> 01:27:33.700
<v Speaker 5>and so the dominance hierarchy is a </v>
<v Speaker 5>mechanism that selects heroes and then </v>

1708
01:27:33.700 --> 01:27:36.300
<v Speaker 5>breeds them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so then we watched that for $6,</v>

1709
01:27:36.301 --> 01:27:41.301
<v Speaker 5>million years.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We start to understand what it means to </v>

1710
01:27:41.301 --> 01:27:44.381
<v Speaker 5>be the hero.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We start to tell stories about that and </v>

1711
01:27:44.381 --> 01:27:46.991
<v Speaker 5>so then not only are we genetically </v>
<v Speaker 5>aiming at that with the dominance </v>

1712
01:27:46.991 --> 01:27:49.760
<v Speaker 5>hierarchy is a selection mechanism </v>
<v Speaker 5>mediated by female choice,</v>

1713
01:27:50.030 --> 01:27:52.430
<v Speaker 5>but our stories are trying to push us in</v>
<v Speaker 5>that direction.</v>

1714
01:27:52.840 --> 01:27:54.170
<v Speaker 5>And so then we say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well look,</v>

1715
01:27:54.171 --> 01:27:59.171
<v Speaker 5>that person's admirable tell story about</v>
<v Speaker 5>him and we say this person is admirable </v>

1716
01:27:59.171 --> 01:28:03.570
<v Speaker 5>of cal story about him and this person </v>
<v Speaker 5>is admirable and at the same time we </v>

1717
01:28:03.570 --> 01:28:07.541
<v Speaker 5>talk about the people who aren't </v>
<v Speaker 5>admirable and then we start having </v>

1718
01:28:07.541 --> 01:28:08.510
<v Speaker 5>admirable and non admirable as </v>
<v Speaker 5>categories.</v>

1719
01:28:08.960 --> 01:28:13.960
<v Speaker 5>And out of that you get something like </v>
<v Speaker 5>good and evil and then you can start to </v>

1720
01:28:13.960 --> 01:28:16.070
<v Speaker 5>imagine the perfect person.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That would be not only.</v>

1721
01:28:16.071 --> 01:28:18.680
<v Speaker 5>So it would be you take 10 admirable </v>
<v Speaker 5>people in.</v>

1722
01:28:18.681 --> 01:28:22.460
<v Speaker 5>You pull out someone who's met admirable</v>
<v Speaker 5>and that's a hero.</v>

1723
01:28:22.730 --> 01:28:26.060
<v Speaker 5>That becomes a religious figure across </v>
<v Speaker 5>time that becomes a savior,</v>

1724
01:28:26.061 --> 01:28:31.061
<v Speaker 5>a messiah across time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as we conceptualize what the ideal </v>

1725
01:28:31.061 --> 01:28:33.980
<v Speaker 5>person is and we didn't in the West.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Here's how we figured it out.</v>

1726
01:28:34.010 --> 01:28:39.010
<v Speaker 5>We said the ideal person,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the ideal man is the person who tells </v>

1727
01:28:39.010 --> 01:28:39.680
<v Speaker 5>the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And what that means is that the best way</v>

1728
01:28:39.681 --> 01:28:44.681
<v Speaker 5>of climbing up any possible dominance </v>
<v Speaker 5>hierarchy in a way that's most stable </v>

1729
01:28:44.681 --> 01:28:45.520
<v Speaker 5>and most lasting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's,</v>

1730
01:28:45.530 --> 01:28:47.420
<v Speaker 5>that's the conclusion of western </v>
<v Speaker 5>culture.</v>

1731
01:28:47.421 --> 01:28:47.470
<v Speaker 5>Sure.</v>

1732
01:28:47.860 --> 01:28:49.300
<v Speaker 3>So in a sense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>psychologically,</v>

1733
01:28:49.301 --> 01:28:54.301
<v Speaker 3>when you talk about postmodernists and </v>
<v Speaker 3>their rejection of these classic male </v>

1734
01:28:54.301 --> 01:28:58.081
<v Speaker 3>structures are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what they're doing is realizing that </v>

1735
01:28:58.081 --> 01:29:00.760
<v Speaker 3>they're not going to compete in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>classic as stated male hierarchy.</v>

1736
01:29:00.761 --> 01:29:02.190
<v Speaker 3>So they're their own</v>

1737
01:29:02.190 --> 01:29:03.770
<v Speaker 1>version of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

1738
01:29:03.810 --> 01:29:05.280
<v Speaker 1>That's the creative element.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

1739
01:29:05.281 --> 01:29:05.850
<v Speaker 1>While we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

1740
01:29:05.900 --> 01:29:07.230
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we asked earlier,</v>

1741
01:29:07.231 --> 01:29:10.490
<v Speaker 1>what's the motivation of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>pathological guys who are out there like</v>

1742
01:29:10.530 --> 01:29:12.990
<v Speaker 1>bolstering up the feminists?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1743
01:29:12.991 --> 01:29:14.300
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1744
01:29:14.550 --> 01:29:16.860
<v Speaker 1>they don't compete any other way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't compete.</v>

1745
01:29:16.920 --> 01:29:19.500
<v Speaker 1>They figured out how to compete.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They compete as allies.</v>

1746
01:29:19.501 --> 01:29:24.230
<v Speaker 1>Let's say [inaudible] very sneaky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1747
01:29:24.300 --> 01:29:25.820
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1748
01:29:26.180 --> 01:29:28.950
<v Speaker 1>and that's how everybody always </v>
<v Speaker 1>describes them to when you.</v>

1749
01:29:28.951 --> 01:29:29.920
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like a,</v>

1750
01:29:30.120 --> 01:29:32.540
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I avoid doing it because I just,</v>

1751
01:29:32.550 --> 01:29:35.160
<v Speaker 1>it just almost feels gross to label them</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that,</v>

1752
01:29:35.161 --> 01:29:40.161
<v Speaker 1>but that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is the way you think of male </v>

1753
01:29:40.161 --> 01:29:40.161
<v Speaker 1>feminists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think of them as sneaky.</v>

1754
01:29:40.430 --> 01:29:42.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1755
01:29:42.450 --> 01:29:47.450
<v Speaker 1>it's creepy and discriminated </v>
<v Speaker 1>discriminatory towards classic male </v>

1756
01:29:47.450 --> 01:29:47.920
<v Speaker 1>behaviors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1757
01:29:47.921 --> 01:29:52.921
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no wonder they haven't got a hope of </v>

1758
01:29:52.921 --> 01:29:53.520
<v Speaker 1>competing in that hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow,</v>

1759
01:29:54.180 --> 01:29:56.010
<v Speaker 1>that's deep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is deep.</v>

1760
01:29:56.730 --> 01:30:00.210
<v Speaker 1>This is going to be hurtful to a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

1761
01:30:00.360 --> 01:30:01.830
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of people listening to this </v>
<v Speaker 1>right now,</v>

1762
01:30:01.831 --> 01:30:04.680
<v Speaker 1>very upset you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You asked earlier why,</v>

1763
01:30:04.710 --> 01:30:07.530
<v Speaker 1>why the postmodernists don't like blunt </v>
<v Speaker 1>speech.</v>

1764
01:30:08.210 --> 01:30:10.370
<v Speaker 1>That's why man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1765
01:30:10.380 --> 01:30:12.720
<v Speaker 1>it's like the truth is something that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Burns,</v>

1766
01:30:12.810 --> 01:30:17.810
<v Speaker 1>it burns off deadwood and people don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>like having their dead wood burn it off </v>

1767
01:30:17.810 --> 01:30:20.190
<v Speaker 1>often because they're like 95 percent </v>
<v Speaker 1>deadwood and,</v>

1768
01:30:20.230 --> 01:30:21.870
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Believe me,</v>

1769
01:30:21.871 --> 01:30:24.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm not being snide about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's no joke.</v>

1770
01:30:25.440 --> 01:30:30.440
<v Speaker 1>When you start to realize how much of </v>
<v Speaker 1>what you've constructed of yourself is </v>

1771
01:30:30.440 --> 01:30:34.190
<v Speaker 1>based on deception and lies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is a horrifying realization and it </v>

1772
01:30:34.190 --> 01:30:36.870
<v Speaker 1>can easily be 95 percent of you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>your things.</v>

1773
01:30:36.871 --> 01:30:38.370
<v Speaker 1>You say things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you act out,</v>

1774
01:30:39.060 --> 01:30:42.120
<v Speaker 1>you know it's well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see that in Pinocchio,</v>

1775
01:30:42.180 --> 01:30:44.790
<v Speaker 1>which I often you discuss,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know Pinocchio,</v>

1776
01:30:44.791 --> 01:30:46.080
<v Speaker 1>when he gets corrupt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as he,</v>

1777
01:30:46.081 --> 01:30:51.081
<v Speaker 1>as he matures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he first learns to lie and then he </v>

1778
01:30:51.081 --> 01:30:52.170
<v Speaker 1>becomes a brain jackass on pleasure </v>
<v Speaker 1>island.</v>

1779
01:30:52.460 --> 01:30:57.460
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's threatened by the underground </v>

1780
01:30:57.460 --> 01:30:57.460
<v Speaker 1>authoritarians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1781
01:30:57.460 --> 01:30:57.460
<v Speaker 1>They're going to sell them to the salt </v>
<v Speaker 1>mines.</v>

1782
01:30:57.460 --> 01:30:58.140
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1783
01:30:58.710 --> 01:31:00.840
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's exactly right man.</v>

1784
01:31:01.800 --> 01:31:06.800
<v Speaker 1>So then you figure out your uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>brain jackass and you're lying all the </v>

1785
01:31:06.800 --> 01:31:06.800
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a terrible realization.</v>

1786
01:31:07.230 --> 01:31:10.890
<v Speaker 1>And then all that needs to be burned </v>
<v Speaker 1>away and no people don't like that.</v>

1787
01:31:11.440 --> 01:31:16.440
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you've been embattled in this </v>

1788
01:31:16.440 --> 01:31:19.131
<v Speaker 1>conflict for quite a long time and I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>got to imagine that the way you look at </v>

1789
01:31:19.801 --> 01:31:21.450
<v Speaker 1>the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way you see things,</v>

1790
01:31:21.451 --> 01:31:22.620
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many steps ahead.</v>

1791
01:31:23.220 --> 01:31:28.220
<v Speaker 1>Do you see any sort of a logical </v>
<v Speaker 1>conclusion to this process?</v>

1792
01:31:28.800 --> 01:31:33.800
<v Speaker 1>Do you see any light at the end of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>tunnel or do you see an impossible to </v>

1793
01:31:35.881 --> 01:31:38.080
<v Speaker 1>avoid conflict?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like do what?</v>

1794
01:31:38.120 --> 01:31:40.860
<v Speaker 1>What do you see when you look at this </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole thing?</v>

1795
01:31:40.861 --> 01:31:45.861
<v Speaker 1>Long term.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While I would say I can't look at it </v>

1796
01:31:45.861 --> 01:31:46.410
<v Speaker 1>longterm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the reason for that is that,</v>

1797
01:31:46.820 --> 01:31:51.060
<v Speaker 1>and this is why I get a kick out of all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the KEC Keka Stan Boys,</v>

1798
01:31:51.660 --> 01:31:56.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do believe that we're in a period of </v>

1799
01:31:56.660 --> 01:31:56.660
<v Speaker 1>chaos.</v>

1800
01:31:56.660 --> 01:31:56.660
<v Speaker 1>What's a Keck is tech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1801
01:31:56.660 --> 01:32:00.470
<v Speaker 1>keck is a mythological country that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>ruled by chaos by the Keck who's a frog </v>

1802
01:32:00.970 --> 01:32:01.990
<v Speaker 1>frog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As it turns out.</v>

1803
01:32:03.110 --> 01:32:06.580
<v Speaker 1>So I don't know about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need to look them up.</v>

1804
01:32:06.610 --> 01:32:08.790
<v Speaker 1>That's a big internet thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pakistan,</v>

1805
01:32:09.160 --> 01:32:10.990
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Big Internet thing.</v>

1806
01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:12.760
<v Speaker 1>All know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the frog and the frog,</v>

1807
01:32:12.761 --> 01:32:17.761
<v Speaker 1>the trump frog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pepe the frog who has apparently so </v>

1808
01:32:17.761 --> 01:32:22.021
<v Speaker 1>distraught that his frog has been used </v>
<v Speaker 1>to align them off and killed them off.</v>

1809
01:32:22.301 --> 01:32:22.960
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good luck.</v>

1810
01:32:22.961 --> 01:32:23.980
<v Speaker 1>He didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

1811
01:32:23.981 --> 01:32:26.250
<v Speaker 1>so that's stupid because that's not who </v>
<v Speaker 1>were,</v>

1812
01:32:27.760 --> 01:32:31.450
<v Speaker 1>who were using pepe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't got the story quite right,</v>

1813
01:32:31.451 --> 01:32:36.451
<v Speaker 1>but I'll get it mostly right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The people who were using Pepsi as a </v>

1814
01:32:36.451 --> 01:32:36.940
<v Speaker 1>meme,</v>
<v Speaker 1>art is used.</v>

1815
01:32:36.941 --> 01:32:38.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that public of Keka Stan,</v>

1816
01:32:40.050 --> 01:32:44.650
<v Speaker 1>so they use this symbol,</v>
<v Speaker 1>k e Dot k to replace lol,</v>

1817
01:32:44.830 --> 01:32:49.150
<v Speaker 1>and the reason they did that was because</v>
<v Speaker 1>k e k in Korean means lol,</v>

1818
01:32:49.180 --> 01:32:50.680
<v Speaker 1>and so it was just this little joke.</v>

1819
01:32:51.190 --> 01:32:52.210
<v Speaker 1>Keck K,</v>
<v Speaker 1>e,</v>

1820
01:32:52.230 --> 01:32:57.230
<v Speaker 1>k.</v>
<v Speaker 1>well then somebody found out these were </v>

1821
01:32:57.230 --> 01:32:57.230
<v Speaker 1>people who were using pepe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember it's a frog.</v>

1822
01:32:57.280 --> 01:33:02.280
<v Speaker 1>Then people found out that Keck was an </v>
<v Speaker 1>Egyptian God and he was a frog and he </v>

1823
01:33:02.280 --> 01:33:05.650
<v Speaker 1>was between categories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of like a transsexual by the way.</v>

1824
01:33:05.800 --> 01:33:10.750
<v Speaker 1>He was between categories and so now </v>
<v Speaker 1>they have this republic of Keck and it's</v>

1825
01:33:10.751 --> 01:33:13.360
<v Speaker 1>ruled by this Egyptian God whose name is</v>
<v Speaker 1>cat,</v>

1826
01:33:13.390 --> 01:33:14.500
<v Speaker 1>who's a frog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hold on,</v>

1827
01:33:14.530 --> 01:33:15.480
<v Speaker 1>go back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go back,</v>

1828
01:33:15.481 --> 01:33:16.690
<v Speaker 1>go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't keep changing this.</v>

1829
01:33:16.960 --> 01:33:19.000
<v Speaker 1>Jamie's doing this in the background </v>
<v Speaker 1>while you're talking,</v>

1830
01:33:19.001 --> 01:33:23.020
<v Speaker 1>but look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a frog with a make America great</v>

1831
01:33:23.021 --> 01:33:28.021
<v Speaker 1>again hat and he's got like a tombstone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It says those who served in the meme </v>

1832
01:33:29.330 --> 01:33:33.310
<v Speaker 1>2015 and 2016.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are the gods of the great meme war.</v>

1833
01:33:33.311 --> 01:33:36.520
<v Speaker 1>We are the shit posters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Legion of Keck,</v>

1834
01:33:36.550 --> 01:33:39.940
<v Speaker 1>we are the internet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the death of the normies,</v>

1835
01:33:40.450 --> 01:33:45.450
<v Speaker 1>lapels and CAC.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are one way or the fuck is going on </v>

1836
01:33:45.450 --> 01:33:45.730
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is the question.</v>

1837
01:33:45.920 --> 01:33:48.640
<v Speaker 1>That's the question you asked me and my </v>
<v Speaker 1>answer was,</v>

1838
01:33:48.641 --> 01:33:51.580
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're in a period of chaos.</v>

1839
01:33:52.180 --> 01:33:54.480
<v Speaker 1>We in a period of chaos and in a period </v>
<v Speaker 1>of chaos,</v>

1840
01:33:54.500 --> 01:33:58.190
<v Speaker 1>the time horizon shrinks because no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the outcome is uncertain whether</v>

1841
01:33:58.191 --> 01:33:59.920
<v Speaker 1>this seems to be truly</v>

1842
01:34:00.010 --> 01:34:02.350
<v Speaker 3>embracing chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean just that statement.</v>

1843
01:34:02.351 --> 01:34:05.680
<v Speaker 3>The frog that Donald Trump thing with </v>
<v Speaker 3>the hat on.</v>

1844
01:34:05.980 --> 01:34:08.410
<v Speaker 3>This is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is one of the things it seems to me</v>

1845
01:34:08.411 --> 01:34:13.411
<v Speaker 3>to be a reoccurring feature in this </v>
<v Speaker 3>whole chaos ballet that we're watching </v>

1846
01:34:14.291 --> 01:34:19.291
<v Speaker 3>play out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that people are enjoying the fact </v>

1847
01:34:19.291 --> 01:34:22.150
<v Speaker 3>that Donald Trump sucks as a president.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't feel threatened by it.</v>

1848
01:34:22.180 --> 01:34:27.180
<v Speaker 3>They like it and they don't like it </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they want to burn this mother </v>

1849
01:34:27.180 --> 01:34:29.020
<v Speaker 3>fucker to the ground and torch this </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing and like a phoenix.</v>

1850
01:34:29.021 --> 01:34:30.860
<v Speaker 3>We'll arrives from the fire.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1851
01:34:30.940 --> 01:34:31.870
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not that.</v>

1852
01:34:32.110 --> 01:34:34.720
<v Speaker 3>It's that they.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They are enjoying that.</v>

1853
01:34:34.721 --> 01:34:37.780
<v Speaker 3>It's falling apart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is why we are the shit posters.</v>

1854
01:34:37.930 --> 01:34:39.480
<v Speaker 3>Do you know what shit posting is?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>

1855
01:34:39.790 --> 01:34:40.470
<v Speaker 3>Jamie explained.</v>

1856
01:34:40.960 --> 01:34:45.960
<v Speaker 1>You're really good at explaining it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're posting for like literally no </v>

1857
01:34:46.191 --> 01:34:48.530
<v Speaker 1>reason other than to get someone mad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like trolling,</v>

1858
01:34:48.531 --> 01:34:50.570
<v Speaker 1>but it's like a separate level of </v>
<v Speaker 1>trolling.</v>

1859
01:34:50.840 --> 01:34:52.010
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good way to say it.</v>

1860
01:34:52.070 --> 01:34:53.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good way of provocation for its</v>

1861
01:34:53.721 --> 01:34:58.721
<v Speaker 1>own sake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie's the first person to tell me </v>

1862
01:34:58.721 --> 01:34:58.721
<v Speaker 1>about posting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't</v>

1863
01:34:58.721 --> 01:35:00.590
<v Speaker 2>aware until about what a year ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1864
01:35:00.680 --> 01:35:01.810
<v Speaker 2>I think it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1865
01:35:02.670 --> 01:35:03.980
<v Speaker 2>preelection time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did not know.</v>

1866
01:35:04.430 --> 01:35:06.950
<v Speaker 2>So I mean there's rules for operating in</v>
<v Speaker 2>chaos,</v>

1867
01:35:07.630 --> 01:35:12.630
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because that's when you're in the belly </v>

1868
01:35:12.630 --> 01:35:12.630
<v Speaker 2>of the beast or the belly of the whale </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're underwater,</v>

1869
01:35:12.630 --> 01:35:16.540
<v Speaker 2>you're in the underworld,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're in the underworld and chaos and </v>

1870
01:35:16.540 --> 01:35:16.540
<v Speaker 2>so that's a really cool thing to know </v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe.</v>

1871
01:35:16.540 --> 01:35:20.820
<v Speaker 2>So imagine that the normal world of </v>
<v Speaker 2>mankind is inside that dominance </v>

1872
01:35:20.820 --> 01:35:25.811
<v Speaker 2>hierarchy where everything is going well</v>
<v Speaker 2>because nothing abnormal is happening </v>

1873
01:35:25.811 --> 01:35:29.351
<v Speaker 2>and you're getting what you need and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>want and you're conscious knowledge </v>

1874
01:35:29.351 --> 01:35:29.351
<v Speaker 2>suffices,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1875
01:35:29.480 --> 01:35:34.480
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then something tilts in that </v>

1876
01:35:34.480 --> 01:35:34.480
<v Speaker 2>structure no longer works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So where do you end up?</v>

1877
01:35:34.480 --> 01:35:37.130
<v Speaker 2>You end up in underworld.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what happens when your partner of</v>

1878
01:35:37.131 --> 01:35:42.131
<v Speaker 2>20 years has a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has a long term affair and you find out </v>

1879
01:35:42.131 --> 01:35:43.640
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you thought you knew where you</v>

1880
01:35:43.641 --> 01:35:48.641
<v Speaker 2>were but you didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and now that you found out you don't </v>

1881
01:35:48.641 --> 01:35:51.110
<v Speaker 2>know where you are when you don't know </v>
<v Speaker 2>where you are,</v>

1882
01:35:51.230 --> 01:35:52.550
<v Speaker 2>you're in the underworld.</v>

1883
01:35:52.600 --> 01:35:53.450
<v Speaker 2>Woo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

1884
01:35:53.451 --> 01:35:55.640
<v Speaker 2>and that's where the unconscious forces </v>
<v Speaker 2>play.</v>

1885
01:35:55.790 --> 01:36:00.790
<v Speaker 2>Those are the gods.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why there's gods in the </v>

1886
01:36:00.790 --> 01:36:02.831
<v Speaker 2>underworld,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and people go to the underworld all the </v>

1887
01:36:02.831 --> 01:36:03.170
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's chaos and fear and depression,</v>

1888
01:36:03.290 --> 01:36:05.090
<v Speaker 2>hopelessness and imaginative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This,</v>

1889
01:36:05.240 --> 01:36:08.000
<v Speaker 2>it's everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's KLM is terrifying to people.</v>

1890
01:36:08.300 --> 01:36:11.900
<v Speaker 2>Terrifying and promising,</v>
<v Speaker 2>terrifying and promising because dragons</v>

1891
01:36:11.901 --> 01:36:15.980
<v Speaker 2>have gold because it's always the </v>
<v Speaker 2>unknown has two things.</v>

1892
01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.540
<v Speaker 2>Just like the future.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like lookout.</v>

1893
01:36:19.580 --> 01:36:23.090
<v Speaker 2>It'll do you in and look out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It offers everything to you.</v>

1894
01:36:23.300 --> 01:36:26.240
<v Speaker 2>That's the underworld.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why the hero always goes into the</v>

1895
01:36:26.241 --> 01:36:31.241
<v Speaker 2>underworld to find a cave full of gold </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's guarded by a dragon in the </v>

1896
01:36:31.241 --> 01:36:33.440
<v Speaker 2>hobbit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Literally Peel will fly.</v>

1897
01:36:34.110 --> 01:36:39.110
<v Speaker 2>That's the oldest story of mankind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really the our oldest story and so </v>

1898
01:36:39.110 --> 01:36:44.080
<v Speaker 2>that the underworld is chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's chaos and down there there's all </v>

1899
01:36:44.080 --> 01:36:48.281
<v Speaker 2>sorts of play of possibility and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>reason the frog with a was the guardian </v>

1900
01:36:48.281 --> 01:36:52.481
<v Speaker 2>of chaos is because of the frog is this </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing that doesn't fit into categories </v>

1901
01:36:52.481 --> 01:36:53.180
<v Speaker 2>you see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's partly water.</v>

1902
01:36:53.210 --> 01:36:55.400
<v Speaker 2>It's partly land.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's tadpole,</v>

1903
01:36:55.401 --> 01:36:56.600
<v Speaker 2>yet it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's adult,</v>

1904
01:36:56.660 --> 01:37:01.660
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's like a fish and then it's like </v>

1905
01:37:01.660 --> 01:37:03.131
<v Speaker 2>an animal doesn't fit and it's things </v>
<v Speaker 2>that don't fit that blow apart the </v>

1906
01:37:03.131 --> 01:37:04.130
<v Speaker 2>categories,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1907
01:37:04.131 --> 01:37:09.131
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what the transsexuals due to the </v>

1908
01:37:09.131 --> 01:37:10.601
<v Speaker 2>category of gender for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that puts you in this state of </v>

1909
01:37:10.601 --> 01:37:14.081
<v Speaker 2>chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It puts you in this state of chaos and </v>

1910
01:37:14.081 --> 01:37:17.441
<v Speaker 2>that's what we're in now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're in a state of chaos and so what </v>

1911
01:37:17.441 --> 01:37:17.441
<v Speaker 2>are the rules for operating in a state </v>
<v Speaker 2>of chaos?</v>

1912
01:37:17.500 --> 01:37:22.500
<v Speaker 2>While as far as I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fundamental rule when operating in </v>

1913
01:37:22.500 --> 01:37:23.990
<v Speaker 2>chaos is tell the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>

1914
01:37:23.991 --> 01:37:28.991
<v Speaker 2>if you will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the people that want to navigate </v>

1915
01:37:28.991 --> 01:37:28.991
<v Speaker 2>this successful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

1916
01:37:28.991 --> 01:37:29.870
<v Speaker 2>All you've got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what you've got as a,</v>

1917
01:37:30.100 --> 01:37:33.350
<v Speaker 2>as a shield and a weapon and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1918
01:37:35.130 --> 01:37:36.350
<v Speaker 2>and that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the guideposts.</v>

1919
01:37:36.430 --> 01:37:37.670
<v Speaker 2>That's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the way through.</v>

1920
01:37:37.670 --> 01:37:39.590
<v Speaker 2>When you see that hero stories all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>

1921
01:37:39.591 --> 01:37:43.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's its allegiance to the truth,</v>

1922
01:37:43.671 --> 01:37:46.130
<v Speaker 2>but the truth is a strange thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a very strange thing.</v>

1923
01:37:46.131 --> 01:37:51.131
<v Speaker 2>Often the hero in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a story has to assimilate their dark </v>

1924
01:37:51.131 --> 01:37:52.940
<v Speaker 2>side before they're capable of telling </v>
<v Speaker 2>the truth.</v>

1925
01:37:53.360 --> 01:37:54.080
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>In the Hobbit,</v>

1926
01:37:54.081 --> 01:37:55.860
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he has to become a thief,</v>

1927
01:37:57.270 --> 01:37:59.130
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because he has to get tough.</v>

1928
01:37:59.280 --> 01:38:00.870
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing.</v>

1929
01:38:00.871 --> 01:38:05.871
<v Speaker 2>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing about telling the truth is </v>

1930
01:38:05.871 --> 01:38:05.871
<v Speaker 2>that it's not for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not for the naive,</v>

1931
01:38:05.970 --> 01:38:10.970
<v Speaker 2>not at all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and partly because it burns off </v>

1932
01:38:10.970 --> 01:38:14.500
<v Speaker 2>deadwood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's partly because it hurts people's </v>

1933
01:38:14.500 --> 01:38:14.500
<v Speaker 2>feelings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a sword.</v>

1934
01:38:14.760 --> 01:38:18.720
<v Speaker 2>So you have to be a warrior.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1935
01:38:18.990 --> 01:38:20.280
<v Speaker 2>A truth warrior</v>

1936
01:38:22.180 --> 01:38:24.100
<v Speaker 3>in this time of chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1937
01:38:24.520 --> 01:38:26.290
<v Speaker 3>What emerges from this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1938
01:38:27.620 --> 01:38:31.820
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes sometimes it's catastrophe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing about these categories,</v>

1939
01:38:31.821 --> 01:38:33.830
<v Speaker 2>they're real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're real.</v>

1940
01:38:34.370 --> 01:38:37.070
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the optimists that I hear say,</v>

1941
01:38:37.071 --> 01:38:42.071
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>depending on the swings and then it </v>

1942
01:38:42.071 --> 01:38:42.071
<v Speaker 2>swings back and I think yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well sometimes it,</v>

1943
01:38:42.071 --> 01:38:46.900
<v Speaker 2>it takes 100 years to swing back and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>takes a hell of a lot of people out on </v>

1944
01:38:46.900 --> 01:38:47.720
<v Speaker 2>the way and sometimes it never swings </v>
<v Speaker 2>back at all.</v>

1945
01:38:48.230 --> 01:38:53.230
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes people go out to fight a </v>

1946
01:38:53.230 --> 01:38:55.040
<v Speaker 2>dragon and it just eats them or it burns</v>
<v Speaker 2>them and that's the end of that.</v>

1947
01:38:55.820 --> 01:39:00.820
<v Speaker 2>And like we're in an unstable period of </v>
<v Speaker 2>time at the moment in a transition </v>

1948
01:39:00.820 --> 01:39:02.600
<v Speaker 2>period of some sort.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't put my finger on it,</v>

1949
01:39:02.601 --> 01:39:07.601
<v Speaker 2>but I know that that's partly why what </v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been saying has been resonating </v>

1950
01:39:07.601 --> 01:39:10.400
<v Speaker 2>with people because obviously it's not </v>
<v Speaker 2>about pronouns.</v>

1951
01:39:10.550 --> 01:39:12.710
<v Speaker 2>Well it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>

1952
01:39:12.711 --> 01:39:13.100
<v Speaker 2>Except</v>

1953
01:39:15.060 --> 01:39:18.240
<v Speaker 3>language turns out to be about a lot </v>
<v Speaker 3>more than like,</v>

1954
01:39:18.241 --> 01:39:23.241
<v Speaker 3>you can't take a little thing like the </v>
<v Speaker 3>desire to transform pronouns and think </v>

1955
01:39:23.241 --> 01:39:24.750
<v Speaker 3>that that's a little thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not a little thing.</v>

1956
01:39:24.751 --> 01:39:29.751
<v Speaker 3>It's also your disagreement with this </v>
<v Speaker 3>use of these new gender pronoun words </v>

1957
01:39:30.781 --> 01:39:35.781
<v Speaker 3>they're trying to force on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People has opened up this discussion </v>

1958
01:39:35.781 --> 01:39:40.070
<v Speaker 3>where you can enlightened people on your</v>
<v Speaker 3>very deep understanding of human </v>

1959
01:39:40.531 --> 01:39:45.531
<v Speaker 3>psychology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not just simply this gender </v>

1960
01:39:45.531 --> 01:39:45.750
<v Speaker 3>pronoun,</v>
<v Speaker 3>disagreement.</v>

1961
01:39:45.930 --> 01:39:48.120
<v Speaker 3>You're transphobic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a racist,</v>

1962
01:39:48.121 --> 01:39:53.121
<v Speaker 3>you're a trans phobic piece of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's this opportunity now because of </v>

1963
01:39:53.121 --> 01:39:57.951
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That mean essentially they fucked with </v>

1964
01:39:57.951 --> 01:40:00.861
<v Speaker 3>the wrong dude really to say it the </v>
<v Speaker 3>right way because your.</v>

1965
01:40:01.971 --> 01:40:03.600
<v Speaker 3>Your understanding of this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this tee shirt,</v>

1966
01:40:04.070 --> 01:40:06.660
<v Speaker 3>it's not shallow in any sense of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>word.</v>

1967
01:40:06.661 --> 01:40:11.661
<v Speaker 3>I mean to engage you in this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this battle of rhetoric is it allows you</v>

1968
01:40:15.210 --> 01:40:20.210
<v Speaker 3>to expose your very deep understanding </v>
<v Speaker 3>what the problems that are going on </v>

1969
01:40:20.210 --> 01:40:21.160
<v Speaker 3>right now with human beings in general.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1970
01:40:21.161 --> 01:40:26.161
<v Speaker 3>it looks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it looks like that to me because what </v>

1971
01:40:26.161 --> 01:40:26.161
<v Speaker 3>happens</v>

1972
01:40:26.161 --> 01:40:28.820
<v Speaker 2>as far as I can tell with my youtube </v>
<v Speaker 2>channel say is that people are often </v>

1973
01:40:28.820 --> 01:40:31.020
<v Speaker 2>pulled in because of the social justice </v>
<v Speaker 2>warrior stuff,</v>

1974
01:40:31.350 --> 01:40:36.350
<v Speaker 2>but then they see I have all these other</v>
<v Speaker 2>videos and they're curious about me </v>

1975
01:40:36.350 --> 01:40:39.320
<v Speaker 2>partly because people are calling me </v>
<v Speaker 2>names and so then they watch a video or </v>

1976
01:40:39.320 --> 01:40:39.650
<v Speaker 2>two and they think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hmm,</v>

1977
01:40:40.530 --> 01:40:42.620
<v Speaker 2>I haven't heard that before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1978
01:40:42.630 --> 01:40:45.180
<v Speaker 2>and then they watch a bunch of them and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then they write me and say,</v>

1979
01:40:45.181 --> 01:40:46.530
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was really helpful.</v>

1980
01:40:47.160 --> 01:40:52.160
<v Speaker 2>And I say thanks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm really happy about that because I </v>

1981
01:40:52.160 --> 01:40:52.160
<v Speaker 2>am.</v>

1982
01:40:52.160 --> 01:40:52.260
<v Speaker 3>Are you in an unmanageable position now </v>
<v Speaker 3>though?</v>

1983
01:40:52.261 --> 01:40:53.980
<v Speaker 3>As far as responding to people</v>

1984
01:40:54.010 --> 01:40:57.220
<v Speaker 2>because like I try to respond to people </v>
<v Speaker 2>but I can't.</v>

1985
01:40:58.180 --> 01:41:01.870
<v Speaker 2>It's not possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would imagine over the last few months</v>

1986
01:41:01.871 --> 01:41:04.150
<v Speaker 2>it must be just overwhelming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1987
01:41:04.151 --> 01:41:04.690
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1988
01:41:04.691 --> 01:41:07.710
<v Speaker 2>Well I've given up trying to keep up on </v>
<v Speaker 2>my email.</v>

1989
01:41:07.720 --> 01:41:12.720
<v Speaker 2>It's just not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My wife helps me with that and I've had </v>

1990
01:41:12.720 --> 01:41:12.720
<v Speaker 2>some other people helped me but you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

1991
01:41:12.720 --> 01:41:16.351
<v Speaker 2>what I do is I look and I try to say </v>
<v Speaker 2>thank you to people and write them a </v>

1992
01:41:16.351 --> 01:41:18.570
<v Speaker 2>couple of lines when I have a moment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

1993
01:41:18.640 --> 01:41:23.640
<v Speaker 2>because I can't get to all of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just come in by the position and </v>

1994
01:41:24.550 --> 01:41:27.940
<v Speaker 2>it's too bad because people are writing </v>
<v Speaker 2>me very heartfelt long letters.</v>

1995
01:41:27.990 --> 01:41:32.990
<v Speaker 2>They're often brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Frequently like amazing letters telling </v>

1996
01:41:32.990 --> 01:41:33.300
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1997
01:41:33.310 --> 01:41:37.090
<v Speaker 2>their experiences with the authoritarian</v>
<v Speaker 2>left or or,</v>

1998
01:41:37.210 --> 01:41:42.210
<v Speaker 2>or the way they've been cornered in one </v>
<v Speaker 2>way or another or or how starting to </v>

1999
01:41:42.611 --> 01:41:44.290
<v Speaker 2>clean up the room changed their life.</v>

2000
01:41:44.320 --> 01:41:49.320
<v Speaker 2>That's quite fun because it's something </v>
<v Speaker 2>I always tell people to do instead of </v>

2001
01:41:49.320 --> 01:41:50.890
<v Speaker 2>going out and protesting Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just can't stand up the room.</v>

2002
01:41:51.490 --> 01:41:53.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Meaning,</v>

2003
01:41:53.380 --> 01:41:58.380
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my sense is is that if you want to </v>

2004
01:41:58.380 --> 01:41:58.380
<v Speaker 2>change the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you start from yourself and work outward</v>

2005
01:41:58.380 --> 01:41:59.770
<v Speaker 2>because you build your competence that </v>
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

2006
01:42:00.040 --> 01:42:05.040
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how you can go out and </v>

2007
01:42:05.040 --> 01:42:06.691
<v Speaker 2>protest the structure of the entire </v>
<v Speaker 2>economic system if can't keep your room </v>

2008
01:42:06.691 --> 01:42:06.691
<v Speaker 2>organized.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2009
01:42:06.691 --> 01:42:10.090
<v Speaker 2>It's not an issue with people though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they always want to enact some sort</v>

2010
01:42:10.091 --> 01:42:14.560
<v Speaker 2>of control over the outside world when </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're inside is all fucked up.</v>

2011
01:42:15.140 --> 01:42:16.810
<v Speaker 2>People that are the most adamant about </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

2012
01:42:16.960 --> 01:42:18.700
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's some truth in that.</v>

2013
01:42:20.140 --> 01:42:21.670
<v Speaker 2>I think there is truth in that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2014
01:42:21.671 --> 01:42:24.730
<v Speaker 2>people try to change the outside world </v>
<v Speaker 2>for lots of ways,</v>

2015
01:42:24.731 --> 01:42:27.520
<v Speaker 2>but many of those ways aren't just pure </v>
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>

2016
01:42:27.880 --> 01:42:29.350
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought about,</v>

2017
01:42:29.710 --> 01:42:34.710
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I made a video call which was called </v>

2018
01:42:34.710 --> 01:42:36.511
<v Speaker 2>message to millennials where I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was called how to change the world </v>

2019
01:42:36.511 --> 01:42:40.111
<v Speaker 2>properly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bit of a on the potential site I </v>

2020
01:42:40.111 --> 01:42:42.931
<v Speaker 2>suppose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I was trying to produce something </v>

2021
01:42:42.931 --> 01:42:45.721
<v Speaker 2>that was a counter position to this idea</v>
<v Speaker 2>that what you should do is go out and </v>

2022
01:42:45.721 --> 01:42:46.570
<v Speaker 2>fix up other people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2023
01:42:46.630 --> 01:42:49.960
<v Speaker 2>that's just not right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a new testament line about that.</v>

2024
01:42:49.961 --> 01:42:51.310
<v Speaker 2>Something about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2025
01:42:51.311 --> 01:42:56.311
<v Speaker 2>not worrying too much about the log in </v>
<v Speaker 2>your neighbor's eye or about the speck </v>

2026
01:42:56.311 --> 01:42:57.760
<v Speaker 2>in your neighbor's eye.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you have a log in your eye.</v>

2027
01:42:58.010 --> 01:42:58.870
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

2028
01:42:59.110 --> 01:43:00.100
<v Speaker 2>no kidding,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

2029
01:43:00.101 --> 01:43:02.560
<v Speaker 2>do you really want to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you really want to face that?</v>

2030
01:43:02.910 --> 01:43:04.770
<v Speaker 2>So what I've thought about is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2031
01:43:04.780 --> 01:43:09.280
<v Speaker 2>what you start to do is you start to </v>
<v Speaker 2>tell and act out the truth locally,</v>

2032
01:43:09.850 --> 01:43:12.460
<v Speaker 2>like within the domain of your actual </v>
<v Speaker 2>competence.</v>

2033
01:43:12.460 --> 01:43:17.460
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because the world presents itself as a </v>

2034
01:43:17.460 --> 01:43:20.041
<v Speaker 2>series of puzzles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of which you're capable of solving </v>

2035
01:43:20.041 --> 01:43:23.431
<v Speaker 2>and some of which you're not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you have many puzzles in front of </v>

2036
01:43:23.431 --> 01:43:24.730
<v Speaker 2>you that you could solve,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you choose not to.</v>

2037
01:43:25.290 --> 01:43:27.970
<v Speaker 2>You know that those are the things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>weigh on your conscience.</v>

2038
01:43:28.180 --> 01:43:28.740
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2039
01:43:28.760 --> 01:43:30.310
<v Speaker 2>I should really do this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you don't.</v>

2040
01:43:30.630 --> 01:43:35.630
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I had this idea a long time ago </v>

2041
01:43:35.630 --> 01:43:35.630
<v Speaker 2>because the world is a pretty dreadful </v>
<v Speaker 2>place.</v>

2042
01:43:35.630 --> 01:43:35.630
<v Speaker 2>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2043
01:43:35.630 --> 01:43:40.620
<v Speaker 2>what would the world be like if people </v>
<v Speaker 2>stopped avoiding the things they knew </v>

2044
01:43:40.620 --> 01:43:41.220
<v Speaker 2>they should do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

2045
01:43:41.260 --> 01:43:46.260
<v Speaker 2>Because the question is how much are we </v>
<v Speaker 2>contributing to the fact that life is a </v>

2046
01:43:46.600 --> 01:43:48.940
<v Speaker 2>as an existential catastrophe and a </v>
<v Speaker 2>tragedy?</v>

2047
01:43:48.941 --> 01:43:51.980
<v Speaker 2>How much is our own corruption </v>
<v Speaker 2>contributing to that?</v>

2048
01:43:52.180 --> 01:43:57.180
<v Speaker 2>How it's a really worthwhile question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Things you leave undone because you're </v>

2049
01:43:57.180 --> 01:43:57.710
<v Speaker 2>angry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're resentful,</v>

2050
01:43:57.711 --> 01:43:59.060
<v Speaker 2>you're lazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have inertia.</v>

2051
01:43:59.720 --> 01:44:01.940
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you consult your conscience and it says,</v>

2052
01:44:01.941 --> 01:44:02.480
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2053
01:44:03.020 --> 01:44:04.820
<v Speaker 2>that place over there could use a little</v>
<v Speaker 2>work.</v>

2054
01:44:05.930 --> 01:44:09.530
<v Speaker 2>It's the same as working on yourself and</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you clean that up because you can.</v>

2055
01:44:10.080 --> 01:44:15.080
<v Speaker 2>Then things are a little clearer around </v>
<v Speaker 2>you and you're a little better off </v>

2056
01:44:15.080 --> 01:44:19.090
<v Speaker 2>because you've practiced a bit and and </v>
<v Speaker 2>so your little stronger and then </v>

2057
01:44:19.090 --> 01:44:19.310
<v Speaker 2>something else manifests itself and </v>
<v Speaker 2>says,</v>

2058
01:44:19.311 --> 01:44:24.311
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe you could like take a crack at </v>

2059
01:44:24.311 --> 01:44:26.201
<v Speaker 2>fixing me up to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you decided to do that and then that </v>

2060
01:44:26.201 --> 01:44:29.051
<v Speaker 2>gets a little bit more pristine and soon</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's humble because you're not </v>

2061
01:44:29.421 --> 01:44:32.600
<v Speaker 2>exceeding your domain of competence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

2062
01:44:32.630 --> 01:44:34.820
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't be fixing up the economy.</v>

2063
01:44:34.850 --> 01:44:39.850
<v Speaker 2>Eighteen year old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't know anything about the </v>

2064
01:44:39.850 --> 01:44:42.851
<v Speaker 2>economy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a massive complex machine beyond </v>

2065
01:44:42.851 --> 01:44:44.330
<v Speaker 2>anyone's understanding and you mess with</v>
<v Speaker 2>it at your peril.</v>

2066
01:44:45.140 --> 01:44:47.180
<v Speaker 2>So when can you even clean up your own </v>
<v Speaker 2>room?</v>

2067
01:44:47.330 --> 01:44:49.010
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2068
01:44:49.550 --> 01:44:54.550
<v Speaker 2>you should think about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should think about that because if </v>

2069
01:44:54.550 --> 01:44:58.871
<v Speaker 2>you can't even clean up your own room,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who the hell are you to give advice to </v>

2070
01:44:58.871 --> 01:44:58.871
<v Speaker 2>the world?</v>

2071
01:45:00.210 --> 01:45:05.210
<v Speaker 3>Very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very important thing for people to hear </v>

2072
01:45:05.210 --> 01:45:07.250
<v Speaker 3>is a very important thing for people to </v>
<v Speaker 3>hear it so many times.</v>

2073
01:45:07.610 --> 01:45:12.610
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's a perfect example that people </v>

2074
01:45:12.610 --> 01:45:13.880
<v Speaker 3>understand and be able to resonate with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It'll resonate with them rather when you</v>

2075
01:45:13.881 --> 01:45:18.881
<v Speaker 3>see people that have a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>inspirational memes on instagram and </v>

2076
01:45:19.941 --> 01:45:24.941
<v Speaker 3>facebook through almost all fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>L Ron Hubbard was completely insane and </v>

2077
01:45:26.901 --> 01:45:31.310
<v Speaker 3>was self-diagnosing and one of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>things he was trying to do,</v>

2078
01:45:31.400 --> 01:45:33.950
<v Speaker 3>I mean if you read Lawrence Wright's </v>
<v Speaker 3>book going clear,</v>

2079
01:45:34.310 --> 01:45:39.310
<v Speaker 3>he was clearly trying to fix himself in </v>
<v Speaker 3>creating this religion,</v>

2080
01:45:40.520 --> 01:45:45.520
<v Speaker 3>this religion that was a lot of it based</v>
<v Speaker 3>on self help principals that he took </v>

2081
01:45:45.520 --> 01:45:49.451
<v Speaker 3>from other sources that you see from a </v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of these people that are like,</v>

2082
01:45:49.920 --> 01:45:54.920
<v Speaker 3>you didn't mean just this real </v>
<v Speaker 3>legitimately motivational people that </v>

2083
01:45:54.920 --> 01:45:59.320
<v Speaker 3>find great benefit in being an example </v>
<v Speaker 3>of powerful,</v>

2084
01:45:59.451 --> 01:46:04.451
<v Speaker 3>strong example and they find great </v>
<v Speaker 3>comfort in showing people the methods </v>

2085
01:46:05.270 --> 01:46:08.570
<v Speaker 3>that they've used in order to improve </v>
<v Speaker 3>their life.</v>

2086
01:46:08.750 --> 01:46:12.260
<v Speaker 3>Like your own self auditing system that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're promoting.</v>

2087
01:46:12.670 --> 01:46:13.610
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's not just,</v>

2088
01:46:13.611 --> 01:46:16.520
<v Speaker 3>it's not that they're all that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all a,</v>

2089
01:46:16.610 --> 01:46:20.150
<v Speaker 3>it's all a not real or you know.</v>

2090
01:46:20.260 --> 01:46:25.260
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's not like there's no way that </v>

2091
01:46:25.260 --> 01:46:25.260
<v Speaker 2>people can improve them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Quite the contrary.</v>

2092
01:46:25.260 --> 01:46:30.040
<v Speaker 2>They people can improve themselves I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think to a degree that we don't </v>

2093
01:46:30.040 --> 01:46:30.040
<v Speaker 2>understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2094
01:46:30.040 --> 01:46:32.110
<v Speaker 2>because a human being for better or </v>
<v Speaker 2>worse,</v>

2095
01:46:32.111 --> 01:46:36.670
<v Speaker 2>this is something potential as well as </v>
<v Speaker 2>something actual that's really weird,</v>

2096
01:46:36.850 --> 01:46:40.090
<v Speaker 2>that idea of potential because it's not </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually measurable,</v>

2097
01:46:40.091 --> 01:46:45.091
<v Speaker 2>are tangible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we seriously believe it's something </v>

2098
01:46:45.091 --> 01:46:45.150
<v Speaker 2>like the idea of spirit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2099
01:46:45.310 --> 01:46:46.270
<v Speaker 2>by potential.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2100
01:46:46.271 --> 01:46:47.800
<v Speaker 2>but people believe in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see,</v>

2101
01:46:48.460 --> 01:46:49.380
<v Speaker 2>because I might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2102
01:46:49.381 --> 01:46:52.350
<v Speaker 2>you're not living up to your potential </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you might disagree,</v>

2103
01:46:52.351 --> 01:46:55.740
<v Speaker 2>but you would definitely understand the </v>
<v Speaker 2>statement and you think,</v>

2104
01:46:55.741 --> 01:46:57.030
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is this potential?</v>

2105
01:46:57.031 --> 01:46:59.160
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not actual.</v>

2106
01:46:59.430 --> 01:47:00.450
<v Speaker 2>It's not real,</v>

2107
01:47:00.630 --> 01:47:01.950
<v Speaker 3>but it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't it though?</v>

2108
01:47:02.100 --> 01:47:05.460
<v Speaker 3>If you see someone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially artistic,</v>

2109
01:47:05.790 --> 01:47:10.790
<v Speaker 3>like you see someone who may be self </v>
<v Speaker 3>sabotage with drugs or alcohol or </v>

2110
01:47:10.790 --> 01:47:14.610
<v Speaker 3>personal chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they can create amazing music,</v>

2111
01:47:14.611 --> 01:47:17.520
<v Speaker 3>but they never get it out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You see that oftentimes with the artists</v>

2112
01:47:17.880 --> 01:47:21.000
<v Speaker 3>and oftentimes you see that after </v>
<v Speaker 3>initial success,</v>

2113
01:47:21.001 --> 01:47:25.410
<v Speaker 3>you'll see some amazing motivation early</v>
<v Speaker 3>in their career.</v>

2114
01:47:25.411 --> 01:47:28.980
<v Speaker 3>Then initial success and then self </v>
<v Speaker 3>sabotage after the fact,</v>

2115
01:47:29.280 --> 01:47:34.280
<v Speaker 3>not realizing their potential.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Obviously they've hit some sort of a </v>

2116
01:47:34.280 --> 01:47:36.210
<v Speaker 3>frequency with a resonate with people </v>
<v Speaker 3>that appreciate them.</v>

2117
01:47:36.720 --> 01:47:38.850
<v Speaker 3>Authors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you see that with musicians,</v>

2118
01:47:38.851 --> 01:47:39.850
<v Speaker 3>comedians,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2119
01:47:39.851 --> 01:47:44.851
<v Speaker 3>all sorts of people to create things and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then they're not living up to their </v>

2120
01:47:44.851 --> 01:47:49.011
<v Speaker 3>potential because they've allowed the </v>
<v Speaker 3>demons to take over the inner workings </v>

2121
01:47:49.011 --> 01:47:49.660
<v Speaker 3>of their mind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2122
01:47:49.680 --> 01:47:51.930
<v Speaker 3>so and again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not talking.</v>

2123
01:47:52.380 --> 01:47:55.950
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of sincere people that are</v>
<v Speaker 3>motivational people that I follow.</v>

2124
01:47:55.951 --> 01:48:00.951
<v Speaker 3>I think there's a lot of people out </v>
<v Speaker 3>there that are then they take a great </v>

2125
01:48:00.951 --> 01:48:04.710
<v Speaker 3>pleasure and expressing to other people </v>
<v Speaker 3>the things that have benefited them.</v>

2126
01:48:04.711 --> 01:48:06.180
<v Speaker 3>So I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to sell them short.</v>

2127
01:48:06.260 --> 01:48:06.980
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>see,</v>

2128
01:48:07.220 --> 01:48:10.660
<v Speaker 2>this is part of the reason I liked the </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychoanalysts say Freud Ngo,</v>

2129
01:48:11.100 --> 01:48:16.100
<v Speaker 2>because as an I would say particularly </v>
<v Speaker 2>young because I haven't read anyone I </v>

2130
01:48:16.100 --> 01:48:18.050
<v Speaker 2>regard as deeper than you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's terrifying,</v>

2131
01:48:18.170 --> 01:48:19.600
<v Speaker 2>truly terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

2132
01:48:19.690 --> 01:48:24.690
<v Speaker 2>but here's one of the things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>differentiates from the typical self </v>

2133
01:48:24.690 --> 01:48:28.061
<v Speaker 2>help person I really love this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that he believes that the pathway to </v>

2134
01:48:28.520 --> 01:48:30.850
<v Speaker 2>completion as a human being is through </v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2135
01:48:31.350 --> 01:48:36.350
<v Speaker 2>is through the embodiment of the monster</v>
<v Speaker 2>embodiment of the monster.</v>

2136
01:48:38.210 --> 01:48:43.160
<v Speaker 2>That's the discovery of the shadow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see so young didn't believe that you</v>

2137
01:48:43.161 --> 01:48:46.160
<v Speaker 2>could be a good person until you </v>
<v Speaker 2>realized your capacity for evil.</v>

2138
01:48:46.220 --> 01:48:49.490
<v Speaker 2>I don't mean acted it out in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but understand that it's possible.</v>

2139
01:48:49.491 --> 01:48:50.780
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not only understand it,</v>

2140
01:48:50.781 --> 01:48:54.080
<v Speaker 2>but then to bring it under your control.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see,</v>

2141
01:48:54.081 --> 01:48:59.081
<v Speaker 2>because there's a big difference between</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone who's naive and is a good </v>

2142
01:48:59.081 --> 01:48:59.081
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>

2143
01:48:59.510 --> 01:49:04.510
<v Speaker 2>They're naive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're a good person because they can </v>

2144
01:49:04.510 --> 01:49:04.510
<v Speaker 2>not be there like a domesticated house </v>
<v Speaker 2>cat.</v>

2145
01:49:05.160 --> 01:49:10.160
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't even have the capacity to be </v>

2146
01:49:10.160 --> 01:49:10.790
<v Speaker 2>bad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there's no morality in that.</v>

2147
01:49:11.600 --> 01:49:15.200
<v Speaker 2>The morality comes when you're a monster</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you can control it,</v>

2148
01:49:15.680 --> 01:49:17.690
<v Speaker 2>and that's the union encounter with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>shadow.</v>

2149
01:49:17.700 --> 01:49:19.010
<v Speaker 2>So young said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

2150
01:49:19.011 --> 01:49:21.350
<v Speaker 2>that the roots of the shadow go all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>way down to hell,</v>

2151
01:49:21.710 --> 01:49:25.280
<v Speaker 2>and what he meant by that is that you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can think about it literally.</v>

2152
01:49:25.281 --> 01:49:30.281
<v Speaker 2>You think about it metaphorically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll just think about it </v>

2153
01:49:30.281 --> 01:49:31.460
<v Speaker 2>metaphorically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like if you start to understand who</v>

2154
01:49:31.461 --> 01:49:36.461
<v Speaker 2>you are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you understand the Nazis and who </v>

2155
01:49:36.461 --> 01:49:38.620
<v Speaker 2>wants to understand the Nazis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2156
01:49:38.870 --> 01:49:42.830
<v Speaker 2>I can understand sex criminals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can understand them,</v>

2157
01:49:43.600 --> 01:49:48.600
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can understand Nazis and the reason </v>

2158
01:49:48.600 --> 01:49:51.460
<v Speaker 2>for is because I can see that as an </v>
<v Speaker 2>aspect of myself truly,</v>

2159
01:49:52.540 --> 01:49:55.510
<v Speaker 2>but one of the things that so inter and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's terrifying to realize that,</v>

2160
01:49:55.600 --> 01:49:57.610
<v Speaker 2>which is why it's terrifying to realize </v>
<v Speaker 2>the shadow,</v>

2161
01:49:57.730 --> 01:49:59.320
<v Speaker 2>which is why people don't do it.</v>

2162
01:49:59.860 --> 01:50:02.350
<v Speaker 2>It's no wonder they don't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2163
01:50:02.690 --> 01:50:07.690
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a horrible thing to realize that </v>

2164
01:50:07.690 --> 01:50:10.090
<v Speaker 2>you're human and what being human means </v>
<v Speaker 2>like Angel,</v>

2165
01:50:10.470 --> 01:50:13.420
<v Speaker 2>like Christ to Satan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the human being.</v>

2166
01:50:14.350 --> 01:50:15.640
<v Speaker 2>And you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2167
01:50:15.850 --> 01:50:17.050
<v Speaker 2>those aren't real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

2168
01:50:17.051 --> 01:50:19.060
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well they're figments of the imagination</v>

2169
01:50:19.061 --> 01:50:21.580
<v Speaker 2>that the human race constructed to </v>
<v Speaker 2>describe themselves.</v>

2170
01:50:21.760 --> 01:50:25.120
<v Speaker 2>Find that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does that make it less frightening?</v>

2171
01:50:25.210 --> 01:50:28.150
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2172
01:50:28.151 --> 01:50:30.670
<v Speaker 2>and it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't make it any less frightening.</v>

2173
01:50:30.671 --> 01:50:33.310
<v Speaker 2>If you take those two extreme seriously </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he might say,</v>

2174
01:50:33.311 --> 01:50:35.290
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's going to take the Christ extreme?</v>

2175
01:50:35.291 --> 01:50:36.760
<v Speaker 2>Seriously?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's no problem,</v>

2176
01:50:36.761 --> 01:50:40.150
<v Speaker 2>man dispense with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He tried getting rid of the other side.</v>

2177
01:50:40.450 --> 01:50:45.450
<v Speaker 2>See how you do with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yones idea that you find so </v>

2178
01:50:47.321 --> 01:50:47.980
<v Speaker 2>compelling</v>

2179
01:50:48.510 --> 01:50:53.510
<v Speaker 3>was essentially that one has to </v>
<v Speaker 3>understand their potential for horrific </v>

2180
01:50:54.241 --> 01:50:56.250
<v Speaker 3>behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That it almost exists in all of us,</v>

2181
01:50:56.251 --> 01:50:59.770
<v Speaker 3>that it's a facet of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of just the human.</v>

2182
01:51:00.700 --> 01:51:01.360
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

2183
01:51:01.600 --> 01:51:05.650
<v Speaker 2>I know partly why you're so popular.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's because you're a monster.</v>

2184
01:51:06.400 --> 01:51:06.880
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

2185
01:51:06.881 --> 01:51:09.520
<v Speaker 2>I watched what you did to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Kardashians on your,</v>

2186
01:51:09.521 --> 01:51:10.180
<v Speaker 2>on your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2187
01:51:10.260 --> 01:51:12.250
<v Speaker 2>engender on your comedy show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2188
01:51:12.400 --> 01:51:15.010
<v Speaker 2>You did this whole gargoyle thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2189
01:51:15.011 --> 01:51:16.240
<v Speaker 2>You remember,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you laugh.</v>

2190
01:51:16.270 --> 01:51:16.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see.</v>

2191
01:51:16.681 --> 01:51:18.100
<v Speaker 2>You can even laugh about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2192
01:51:18.101 --> 01:51:23.101
<v Speaker 2>it was horrifying to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You were coached up on the back of this </v>

2193
01:51:23.101 --> 01:51:23.101
<v Speaker 2>chair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's horrifying to do.</v>

2194
01:51:23.140 --> 01:51:24.910
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't believe you did it.</v>

2195
01:51:24.950 --> 01:51:25.510
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the problem</v>

2196
01:51:25.620 --> 01:51:28.310
<v Speaker 3>doing it is this is going to sound </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucked up,</v>

2197
01:51:28.700 --> 01:51:33.700
<v Speaker 3>but while I'm doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not thinking I'm doing a comedy </v>

2198
01:51:33.700 --> 01:51:35.090
<v Speaker 3>sketch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is what's fucked up about it.</v>

2199
01:51:35.360 --> 01:51:38.180
<v Speaker 3>While I'm crouched there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm thinking like a demon.</v>

2200
01:51:39.020 --> 01:51:41.330
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>while that's the reason why I do it that</v>

2201
01:51:41.331 --> 01:51:44.660
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The reason why do it in the like,</v>

2202
01:51:45.050 --> 01:51:46.940
<v Speaker 3>I'm a very flexible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2203
01:51:46.941 --> 01:51:51.941
<v Speaker 3>So it's one of the reasons why I do it </v>
<v Speaker 3>in almost because I want it to be in an </v>

2204
01:51:51.941 --> 01:51:54.530
<v Speaker 3>almost a w,</v>
<v Speaker 3>w,</v>

2205
01:51:54.540 --> 01:51:58.490
<v Speaker 3>W in a way that you don't imagine human </v>
<v Speaker 3>beings moving,</v>

2206
01:51:58.880 --> 01:51:59.770
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you,</v>

2207
01:51:59.810 --> 01:52:04.810
<v Speaker 3>it's like it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it confuses the mind because it's not </v>

2208
01:52:04.810 --> 01:52:06.560
<v Speaker 3>standard human movement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then on top of that,</v>

2209
01:52:06.590 --> 01:52:09.470
<v Speaker 3>the way I'm thinking and then just like </v>
<v Speaker 3>explosive.</v>

2210
01:52:09.471 --> 01:52:13.220
<v Speaker 3>Like when he yells out nonsense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I say he because I don't think of it</v>

2211
01:52:13.221 --> 01:52:14.870
<v Speaker 3>as me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really think it's,</v>

2212
01:52:15.030 --> 01:52:18.260
<v Speaker 3>it sounds so pretentious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but while I'm doing that,</v>

2213
01:52:18.350 --> 01:52:20.810
<v Speaker 3>my brain goes into another place.</v>

2214
01:52:21.700 --> 01:52:22.530
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's real.</v>

2215
01:52:22.570 --> 01:52:27.570
<v Speaker 2>You can't do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't do that unless you're a </v>

2216
01:52:27.570 --> 01:52:27.570
<v Speaker 2>monster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a.</v>

2217
01:52:27.570 --> 01:52:29.260
<v Speaker 2>But it's also the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See very happy.</v>

2218
01:52:29.261 --> 01:52:30.340
<v Speaker 2>When I retired it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

2219
01:52:31.230 --> 01:52:34.840
<v Speaker 2>I was really quite taken aback.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was very impressed by it.</v>

2220
01:52:35.160 --> 01:52:36.880
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was hilarious to begin </v>
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

2221
01:52:36.881 --> 01:52:40.810
<v Speaker 2>but the fact that you would go there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought that was really interesting.</v>

2222
01:52:40.811 --> 01:52:43.330
<v Speaker 2>And comedians are like that because they</v>
<v Speaker 2>go into dark places.</v>

2223
01:52:43.720 --> 01:52:48.720
<v Speaker 2>They're tricksters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're a mediator between the normal </v>

2224
01:52:48.720 --> 01:52:49.250
<v Speaker 2>world in the world of the gods.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're tricksters.</v>

2225
01:52:49.790 --> 01:52:54.790
<v Speaker 2>So it was very funny to watch you do </v>
<v Speaker 2>that and I wondered how far you would </v>

2226
01:52:54.790 --> 01:52:58.571
<v Speaker 2>let yourself get into it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think part of the reason that </v>

2227
01:52:58.571 --> 01:53:00.560
<v Speaker 2>you're appealing to people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you don't mind me saying this,</v>

2228
01:53:00.561 --> 01:53:05.561
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not trying to be forward </v>

2229
01:53:05.561 --> 01:53:05.750
<v Speaker 2>particularly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I thought about it a lot,</v>

2230
01:53:05.751 --> 01:53:09.170
<v Speaker 2>is that you're a tough guy and you tell </v>
<v Speaker 2>the truth,</v>

2231
01:53:09.680 --> 01:53:10.940
<v Speaker 2>but it's both of those together.</v>

2232
01:53:10.940 --> 01:53:15.940
<v Speaker 2>That's what's doing it because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people don't look at us and think like </v>

2233
01:53:16.190 --> 01:53:19.550
<v Speaker 2>holier than thou preacher,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that isn't what they think.</v>

2234
01:53:20.060 --> 01:53:25.060
<v Speaker 2>They think tough guy who's trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>figure things out like right on.</v>

2235
01:53:25.970 --> 01:53:27.410
<v Speaker 2>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a good year.</v>

2236
01:53:27.411 --> 01:53:32.411
<v Speaker 2>A good figure for the times because this</v>
<v Speaker 2>whole war against the fellow egocentrism</v>

2237
01:53:33.320 --> 01:53:35.780
<v Speaker 2>need calls forward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People who are like you.</v>

2238
01:53:35.870 --> 01:53:39.050
<v Speaker 2>If we're lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And those are guys who have this warrior</v>

2239
01:53:39.051 --> 01:53:40.700
<v Speaker 2>end because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a fighter.</v>

2240
01:53:41.960 --> 01:53:44.150
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you're going to be a fighter,</v>

2241
01:53:44.151 --> 01:53:46.910
<v Speaker 2>you have to want to win and you have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to hurt people.</v>

2242
01:53:46.911 --> 01:53:48.410
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not for the sake of hurting them.</v>

2243
01:53:48.411 --> 01:53:50.420
<v Speaker 2>That's what makes you different than an </v>
<v Speaker 2>evil person.</v>

2244
01:53:51.290 --> 01:53:56.290
<v Speaker 2>But you have to have that capacity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to develop that and you know </v>

2245
01:53:56.290 --> 01:53:57.080
<v Speaker 2>that's the step on the way to </v>
<v Speaker 2>enlightenment,</v>

2246
01:53:57.081 --> 01:53:59.240
<v Speaker 2>weirdly enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because that isn't what people think.</v>

2247
01:53:59.740 --> 01:54:04.740
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I definitely think that truth is a </v>

2248
01:54:04.740 --> 01:54:07.321
<v Speaker 3>valuable commodity in this very bizarre </v>
<v Speaker 3>time and I think that's also one of the </v>

2249
01:54:07.321 --> 01:54:11.971
<v Speaker 3>reasons why you are very popular as a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have stuck your neck out in a world </v>

2250
01:54:11.971 --> 01:54:16.000
<v Speaker 3>that does not encourage it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nor nor academia.</v>

2251
01:54:16.010 --> 01:54:18.670
<v Speaker 3>Not only does it not occurred,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it encourages the exact opposite.</v>

2252
01:54:18.671 --> 01:54:23.671
<v Speaker 3>Encourages you to stick your head in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>books and just to in some way,</v>

2253
01:54:24.161 --> 01:54:29.161
<v Speaker 3>shape or form.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go with the tide like whichever way it </v>

2254
01:54:29.161 --> 01:54:29.830
<v Speaker 3>is and get your tenure and just.</v>

2255
01:54:30.330 --> 01:54:32.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well it's intellectual pride,</v>

2256
01:54:32.420 --> 01:54:37.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't consider myself an </v>

2257
01:54:37.420 --> 01:54:37.420
<v Speaker 2>intellectual precisely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you consider yourself?</v>

2258
01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:42.330
<v Speaker 2>What is an intellectual if you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how about nobody?</v>

2259
01:54:42.420 --> 01:54:43.290
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing,</v>

2260
01:54:43.730 --> 01:54:46.140
<v Speaker 2>see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because my ideas aren't disembodied.</v>

2261
01:54:47.120 --> 01:54:52.120
<v Speaker 2>I act them out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But to be an intellectual romantic in </v>

2262
01:54:52.120 --> 01:54:52.120
<v Speaker 2>some sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2263
01:54:52.120 --> 01:54:55.170
<v Speaker 2>I don't live in my head exactly and an </v>
<v Speaker 2>influential some degree,</v>

2264
01:54:55.171 --> 01:54:58.560
<v Speaker 2>but what is an intellectual do then you </v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

2265
01:54:58.580 --> 01:55:01.740
<v Speaker 2>do you think of it as a pejorative?</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you think of the term intellectual,</v>

2266
01:55:01.741 --> 01:55:04.380
<v Speaker 2>do you think of it as a limited person?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2267
01:55:04.440 --> 01:55:08.220
<v Speaker 2>it's a funny thing in this book called </v>
<v Speaker 2>zero through strip.</v>

2268
01:55:08.280 --> 01:55:13.280
<v Speaker 2>Nisha has is his Zarathustra come down </v>
<v Speaker 2>from a mountain top after being </v>

2269
01:55:13.280 --> 01:55:16.911
<v Speaker 2>enlightened and he sees this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he goes into the public square and </v>

2270
01:55:16.911 --> 01:55:20.961
<v Speaker 2>there's this little tiny being there </v>
<v Speaker 2>like an inch high and it has a gigantic </v>

2271
01:55:20.961 --> 01:55:25.191
<v Speaker 2>ear on it and it's talking and people </v>
<v Speaker 2>are gathered around listening and that </v>

2272
01:55:25.191 --> 01:55:27.480
<v Speaker 2>was sort of niches metaphor for an </v>
<v Speaker 2>intellectual,</v>

2273
01:55:29.370 --> 01:55:33.750
<v Speaker 2>mostly little except maybe the rational </v>
<v Speaker 2>faculty or something like that.</v>

2274
01:55:33.750 --> 01:55:38.670
<v Speaker 2>Expanded to monstrous dimensions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unbalanced in that manner and,</v>

2275
01:55:38.880 --> 01:55:39.660
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2276
01:55:39.850 --> 01:55:43.410
<v Speaker 2>and prone to become the subject of </v>
<v Speaker 2>totalitarian.</v>

2277
01:55:43.980 --> 01:55:48.980
<v Speaker 2>That's the worship of the rational mind </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the Catholic church always warned </v>

2278
01:55:48.980 --> 01:55:48.980
<v Speaker 2>against.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2279
01:55:48.980 --> 01:55:53.361
<v Speaker 2>it's not like the Catholic church.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course I have to say that I won't </v>

2280
01:55:53.361 --> 01:55:54.960
<v Speaker 2>even say it or you don't need to know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

2281
01:55:54.990 --> 01:55:55.920
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2282
01:55:56.100 --> 01:56:01.100
<v Speaker 2>but the point is they had a warning and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the warning was that the rational mind </v>

2283
01:56:01.100 --> 01:56:01.590
<v Speaker 2>like to fall in love with its own </v>
<v Speaker 2>creations.</v>

2284
01:56:02.910 --> 01:56:05.910
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the term intellectual,</v>

2285
01:56:05.911 --> 01:56:10.911
<v Speaker 2>the problem is that it identifies one </v>
<v Speaker 2>aspect and it it,</v>

2286
01:56:12.150 --> 01:56:17.150
<v Speaker 2>it sort of defines one aspect of </v>
<v Speaker 2>behavior and thinking only one.</v>

2287
01:56:17.340 --> 01:56:18.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the intellect as well.</v>

2288
01:56:18.781 --> 01:56:20.330
<v Speaker 2>What happens is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it's like,</v>

2289
01:56:20.640 --> 01:56:22.670
<v Speaker 2>it's like the intellect is raised to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2290
01:56:22.790 --> 01:56:26.160
<v Speaker 2>to the status of highest God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the right way to think.</v>

2291
01:56:26.200 --> 01:56:27.890
<v Speaker 2>Seeing the God idea here.</v>

2292
01:56:27.930 --> 01:56:29.970
<v Speaker 2>Here's another way of thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's quite cool.</v>

2293
01:56:29.971 --> 01:56:33.870
<v Speaker 2>I learned this from you and you can take</v>
<v Speaker 2>it for what it's worth.</v>

2294
01:56:34.300 --> 01:56:39.300
<v Speaker 2>I'm the highest ideal that a person </v>
<v Speaker 2>holds consciously or unconsciously.</v>

2295
01:56:40.110 --> 01:56:45.060
<v Speaker 2>That's their God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It functions in precisely that manner.</v>

2296
01:56:45.750 --> 01:56:46.680
<v Speaker 2>And people might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2297
01:56:46.681 --> 01:56:47.970
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe in God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

2298
01:56:47.971 --> 01:56:49.380
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it depends on what you mean.</v>

2299
01:56:49.740 --> 01:56:52.590
<v Speaker 2>Like I know I'm not being,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not being foolish about that.</v>

2300
01:56:52.650 --> 01:56:57.650
<v Speaker 2>It's like we're very complicated </v>
<v Speaker 2>creatures and we're run by all sorts of </v>

2301
01:56:57.650 --> 01:56:59.490
<v Speaker 2>very strange things down there in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>unconscious.</v>

2302
01:56:59.520 --> 01:57:04.520
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the Greeks thought we were the </v>

2303
01:57:04.520 --> 01:57:04.520
<v Speaker 2>playthings of the Gods because we serve </v>
<v Speaker 2>lust,</v>

2304
01:57:04.650 --> 01:57:07.050
<v Speaker 2>we serve thirst,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we serve hunger,</v>

2305
01:57:07.140 --> 01:57:09.330
<v Speaker 2>we serve rage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2306
01:57:09.331 --> 01:57:13.160
<v Speaker 2>and those things all transcend us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's why they were gods.</v>

2307
01:57:13.420 --> 01:57:14.130
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rage.</v>

2308
01:57:14.131 --> 01:57:15.270
<v Speaker 2>That's the war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God.</v>

2309
01:57:15.990 --> 01:57:16.950
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why is it a god?</v>

2310
01:57:16.951 --> 01:57:18.390
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it exists forever.</v>

2311
01:57:18.900 --> 01:57:23.900
<v Speaker 2>It exists in all people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It takes them over and directs their </v>

2312
01:57:23.900 --> 01:57:23.900
<v Speaker 2>behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a god.</v>

2313
01:57:24.210 --> 01:57:24.930
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can.</v>

2314
01:57:24.950 --> 01:57:27.160
<v Speaker 2>You can quibble about the details.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2315
01:57:27.180 --> 01:57:28.410
<v Speaker 2>it's not a god.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

2316
01:57:28.411 --> 01:57:31.860
<v Speaker 2>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a psychological force to people get</v>

2317
01:57:32.100 --> 01:57:34.260
<v Speaker 2>too hung up on that one word.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2318
01:57:34.261 --> 01:57:35.580
<v Speaker 2>they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't really.</v>

2319
01:57:36.100 --> 01:57:38.850
<v Speaker 2>We have to think about it functionally </v>
<v Speaker 2>to some degree.</v>

2320
01:57:38.851 --> 01:57:40.830
<v Speaker 2>We have to think about what that idea </v>
<v Speaker 2>means.</v>

2321
01:57:41.460 --> 01:57:41.850
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2322
01:57:41.851 --> 01:57:45.630
<v Speaker 2>we had that idea forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It isn't just some superstition.</v>

2323
01:57:45.930 --> 01:57:50.930
<v Speaker 2>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've got to be more sophisticated than </v>

2324
01:57:50.930 --> 01:57:50.930
<v Speaker 2>that man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2325
01:57:50.930 --> 01:57:51.830
<v Speaker 2>and that's partly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2326
01:57:51.831 --> 01:57:56.831
<v Speaker 2>this is partly what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I think is unfortunate about the </v>

2327
01:57:56.831 --> 01:57:57.000
<v Speaker 2>new atheists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

2328
01:57:57.010 --> 01:57:59.670
<v Speaker 2>is they don't take the damn problem </v>
<v Speaker 2>seriously.</v>

2329
01:58:00.090 --> 01:58:00.810
<v Speaker 2>They think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2330
01:58:00.811 --> 01:58:02.910
<v Speaker 2>Christianity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's just a bunch of superstition.</v>

2331
01:58:02.940 --> 01:58:04.920
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really?</v>

2332
01:58:06.180 --> 01:58:07.920
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sorry,</v>

2333
01:58:08.160 --> 01:58:09.930
<v Speaker 2>that's just not deep enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2334
01:58:10.560 --> 01:58:15.560
<v Speaker 2>So what it really is is the accounts of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people trying to work out the issues of </v>

2335
01:58:17.341 --> 01:58:20.130
<v Speaker 2>being a human.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me give you another example.</v>

2336
01:58:20.160 --> 01:58:22.260
<v Speaker 2>This is so cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is so cool.</v>

2337
01:58:22.290 --> 01:58:27.180
<v Speaker 2>It's northrop Frye who is a biblical </v>
<v Speaker 2>scholar in at the University of Toronto.</v>

2338
01:58:27.570 --> 01:58:32.570
<v Speaker 2>This was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This was one of his elucidations of the </v>

2339
01:58:32.570 --> 01:58:35.631
<v Speaker 2>structure of the Bible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Bible is actually a story and which </v>

2340
01:58:35.631 --> 01:58:36.270
<v Speaker 2>is weird because it's a whole bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 2>different books written by a whole bunch</v>

2341
01:58:36.271 --> 01:58:41.271
<v Speaker 2>of different people edited kind of Willy</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nilly over thousands of years and then </v>

2342
01:58:41.271 --> 01:58:42.460
<v Speaker 2>assembled,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know by committee.</v>

2343
01:58:42.460 --> 01:58:45.550
<v Speaker 5>It's a really strange book,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it has a narrative structure.</v>

2344
01:58:46.240 --> 01:58:51.240
<v Speaker 5>So that sort of emerged as a collective </v>
<v Speaker 5>decision across these thousands of </v>

2345
01:58:51.280 --> 01:58:54.070
<v Speaker 5>years.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So the Old Testament.</v>

2346
01:58:54.340 --> 01:58:56.380
<v Speaker 5>Here's the rough story.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In the Old Testament,</v>

2347
01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:02.140
<v Speaker 5>Israel is sort of a middle power and it </v>
<v Speaker 5>rises to power,</v>

2348
01:59:03.340 --> 01:59:08.340
<v Speaker 5>so and domination and then it a profit </v>
<v Speaker 5>or rises and says,</v>

2349
01:59:08.411 --> 01:59:10.390
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you guys are all successful now.</v>

2350
01:59:10.780 --> 01:59:15.780
<v Speaker 5>You starting to get corrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're not paying attention to the </v>

2351
01:59:15.780 --> 01:59:17.821
<v Speaker 5>widows and children.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're not running your state according </v>

2352
01:59:17.821 --> 01:59:19.300
<v Speaker 5>to the superordinate principle.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You might say,</v>

2353
01:59:19.301 --> 01:59:24.301
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the superordinate principal doesn't </v>

2354
01:59:24.301 --> 01:59:24.301
<v Speaker 5>exist.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

2355
01:59:24.301 --> 01:59:25.210
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>keep it running it that way and see what</v>

2356
01:59:25.211 --> 01:59:27.400
<v Speaker 5>the hell happens.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what the prophet says.</v>

2357
01:59:27.401 --> 01:59:29.890
<v Speaker 5>Usually at the risk of his life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He says that to the king,</v>

2358
01:59:30.450 --> 01:59:35.450
<v Speaker 5>so I find you don't believe in God.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't believe in the superordinate </v>

2359
01:59:35.450 --> 01:59:36.040
<v Speaker 5>principle.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's say that the superordinate ethical</v>

2360
01:59:36.041 --> 01:59:37.300
<v Speaker 5>principle,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no problem.</v>

2361
01:59:37.360 --> 01:59:39.460
<v Speaker 5>Keep doing what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's see what happens.</v>

2362
01:59:39.790 --> 01:59:42.510
<v Speaker 5>What happens is in real gets wiped out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2363
01:59:42.520 --> 01:59:46.420
<v Speaker 5>and then for generations it's enslaved </v>
<v Speaker 5>or its population is being destroyed and</v>

2364
01:59:46.421 --> 01:59:51.421
<v Speaker 5>then it sorta climbs back up to power </v>
<v Speaker 5>and then it gets powerful for a brief </v>

2365
01:59:52.481 --> 01:59:55.390
<v Speaker 5>period of time and it gets corrupt and </v>
<v Speaker 5>profit comes up and says,</v>

2366
01:59:55.900 --> 01:59:59.140
<v Speaker 5>you remember that superordinate </v>
<v Speaker 5>principle that you made a covenant with?</v>

2367
01:59:59.260 --> 02:00:01.420
<v Speaker 5>You're not paying any attention to it </v>
<v Speaker 5>anymore.</v>

2368
02:00:01.480 --> 02:00:04.840
<v Speaker 5>You better look the hell out and </v>
<v Speaker 5>everyone ignores it and bang.</v>

2369
02:00:05.140 --> 02:00:06.970
<v Speaker 5>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's order,</v>

2370
02:00:07.990 --> 02:00:09.310
<v Speaker 5>corruption,</v>
<v Speaker 5>chaos,</v>

2371
02:00:10.060 --> 02:00:11.710
<v Speaker 5>order,</v>
<v Speaker 5>corruption,</v>

2372
02:00:11.800 --> 02:00:14.200
<v Speaker 5>chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That happened six times now.</v>

2373
02:00:14.201 --> 02:00:15.940
<v Speaker 5>So here's the night.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's an idea behind it.</v>

2374
02:00:16.300 --> 02:00:18.700
<v Speaker 5>The idea,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because the state keeps rising.</v>

2375
02:00:18.910 --> 02:00:20.500
<v Speaker 5>There's an idea that emerges out of </v>
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

2376
02:00:20.501 --> 02:00:25.501
<v Speaker 5>that the aim is the perfect state.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a utopian dream that arises out </v>

2377
02:00:25.931 --> 02:00:30.931
<v Speaker 5>of that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's call it learned process over </v>

2378
02:00:30.931 --> 02:00:30.931
<v Speaker 5>thousands of years.</v>

2379
02:00:30.931 --> 02:00:35.310
<v Speaker 5>If we could only get the state perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If we could only get the state of </v>

2380
02:00:35.310 --> 02:00:35.310
<v Speaker 5>perfect,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

2381
02:00:35.310 --> 02:00:37.810
<v Speaker 5>let's say like the state of Israel or </v>
<v Speaker 5>the or the Russian state,</v>

2382
02:00:37.811 --> 02:00:42.811
<v Speaker 5>the communist state.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If we could only bring utopia in at the </v>

2383
02:00:42.811 --> 02:00:43.180
<v Speaker 5>political level,</v>
<v Speaker 5>our problems would be solved.</v>

2384
02:00:43.990 --> 02:00:48.990
<v Speaker 5>Well then what happens is there's a </v>
<v Speaker 5>transition in conceptualization that </v>

2385
02:00:49.091 --> 02:00:52.690
<v Speaker 5>happens with the new testament and the </v>
<v Speaker 5>new testament conceptualization is,</v>

2386
02:00:52.960 --> 02:00:55.630
<v Speaker 5>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the state isn't salvation.</v>

2387
02:00:57.130 --> 02:01:00.910
<v Speaker 5>The individual is salvation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now you say,</v>

2388
02:01:00.911 --> 02:01:02.950
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're going to just throw that out.</v>

2389
02:01:02.951 --> 02:01:05.770
<v Speaker 5>Are We?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was a hell of a discovery man.</v>

2390
02:01:06.400 --> 02:01:11.400
<v Speaker 5>It was a and then there's more to it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not only is the individual </v>

2391
02:01:11.400 --> 02:01:14.221
<v Speaker 5>salvation,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's the truthful individual that </v>

2392
02:01:14.221 --> 02:01:16.750
<v Speaker 5>salvation you think of how difficult a </v>
<v Speaker 5>concept like that is to develop.</v>

2393
02:01:17.140 --> 02:01:19.780
<v Speaker 5>If there's anything less self evident </v>
<v Speaker 5>than that,</v>

2394
02:01:20.400 --> 02:01:21.820
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because you think,</v>

2395
02:01:21.821 --> 02:01:23.390
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who's going to run the dominant target?</v>

2396
02:01:23.390 --> 02:01:26.110
<v Speaker 5>It's like the biggest bloody monster </v>
<v Speaker 5>with a club.</v>

2397
02:01:26.590 --> 02:01:27.190
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

2398
02:01:27.191 --> 02:01:31.030
<v Speaker 5>it turns out those are unstable.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Those societies are unstable.</v>

2399
02:01:31.330 --> 02:01:33.430
<v Speaker 5>They don't work.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They collapse into chaos.</v>

2400
02:01:33.700 --> 02:01:38.700
<v Speaker 5>They get corrupt,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they lose sight of the superordinate </v>

2401
02:01:38.700 --> 02:01:38.700
<v Speaker 5>principle.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whatever that is.</v>

2402
02:01:39.500 --> 02:01:44.500
<v Speaker 5>The stable solution is the individual </v>
<v Speaker 5>that tells the truth and it's taken us </v>

2403
02:01:44.500 --> 02:01:48.731
<v Speaker 5>forever to figure that out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and that's partly what the </v>

2404
02:01:48.731 --> 02:01:50.750
<v Speaker 5>postmodernists thereafter.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's their anti fellow egocentrism.</v>

2405
02:01:51.080 --> 02:01:53.540
<v Speaker 5>That's why they skitter off and hide in </v>
<v Speaker 5>the radiology.</v>

2406
02:01:53.720 --> 02:01:56.660
<v Speaker 5>They're afraid to come out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're afraid to be seen.</v>

2407
02:01:56.990 --> 02:01:59.600
<v Speaker 5>They're afraid to speak because they </v>
<v Speaker 5>have nothing to say,</v>

2408
02:02:00.680 --> 02:02:05.680
<v Speaker 5>so we have to get sophisticated about </v>
<v Speaker 5>this stuff or we're going to throw it </v>

2409
02:02:05.680 --> 02:02:07.570
<v Speaker 5>away without understanding it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's.</v>

2410
02:02:07.840 --> 02:02:10.710
<v Speaker 5>It's unbelievable like that stories.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's.</v>

2411
02:02:11.030 --> 02:02:15.290
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's the story upon Western civilization</v>

2412
02:02:15.500 --> 02:02:19.100
<v Speaker 5>is the story upon which Western </v>
<v Speaker 5>civilization is founded.</v>

2413
02:02:19.490 --> 02:02:24.490
<v Speaker 5>That's why Nisha said when God was dead,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that everything would collapse into </v>

2414
02:02:24.490 --> 02:02:24.490
<v Speaker 5>chaos.</v>

2415
02:02:24.490 --> 02:02:27.320
<v Speaker 5>He didn't say that triumphantly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He knew what was gonna happen,</v>

2416
02:02:27.350 --> 02:02:32.350
<v Speaker 5>so to Dostoevsky.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's why I admire those people so </v>

2417
02:02:32.350 --> 02:02:32.420
<v Speaker 5>much.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They knew what was coming,</v>

2418
02:02:33.620 --> 02:02:38.620
<v Speaker 5>so what I've been trying to do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I've been guided in large part by </v>

2419
02:02:38.620 --> 02:02:39.500
<v Speaker 5>young because he was the first seed </v>
<v Speaker 5>young took niches problem,</v>

2420
02:02:39.501 --> 02:02:41.150
<v Speaker 5>seriously neat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You said,</v>

2421
02:02:41.151 --> 02:02:42.620
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're losing our faith.</v>

2422
02:02:42.650 --> 02:02:46.730
<v Speaker 5>We're losing our ability to relate to </v>
<v Speaker 5>the superordinate ethical principle,</v>

2423
02:02:47.270 --> 02:02:50.010
<v Speaker 5>and he actually blame Christianity for </v>
<v Speaker 5>killing itself with the,</v>

2424
02:02:50.050 --> 02:02:52.900
<v Speaker 5>with the sword of truth that it had </v>
<v Speaker 5>produced said,</v>

2425
02:02:52.901 --> 02:02:55.040
<v Speaker 5>so we're going to lose this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it's big trouble.</v>

2426
02:02:55.041 --> 02:03:00.041
<v Speaker 5>Make no mistake about it because our </v>
<v Speaker 5>whole society is founded on those </v>

2427
02:03:00.041 --> 02:03:02.921
<v Speaker 5>principles.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We get rid of the animating spirit at </v>

2428
02:03:02.921 --> 02:03:02.921
<v Speaker 5>the base of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're going to lose all of it.</v>

2429
02:03:03.080 --> 02:03:04.940
<v Speaker 5>So and niche.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You thought,</v>

2430
02:03:04.941 --> 02:03:06.920
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're gonna have to become superhuman to</v>

2431
02:03:06.950 --> 02:03:07.550
<v Speaker 5>manage it.</v>

2432
02:03:07.750 --> 02:03:12.750
<v Speaker 5>Not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's where his concept of the overman </v>

2433
02:03:12.750 --> 02:03:12.750
<v Speaker 5>comes from,</v>
<v Speaker 5>or the Superman,</v>

2434
02:03:12.750 --> 02:03:14.270
<v Speaker 5>which the Nazis sort of pulled off and </v>
<v Speaker 5>parodied.</v>

2435
02:03:14.271 --> 02:03:18.100
<v Speaker 5>I would say now young,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you see human was a student of niches,</v>

2436
02:03:18.110 --> 02:03:20.090
<v Speaker 5>not directly,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but very much influenced by him.</v>

2437
02:03:21.050 --> 02:03:26.050
<v Speaker 5>Young thought that Nisha was wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that we couldn't create our own values </v>

2438
02:03:26.050 --> 02:03:27.170
<v Speaker 5>because look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's so hard to create your own value.</v>

2439
02:03:27.410 --> 02:03:32.410
<v Speaker 5>So let's say you're kind of an </v>
<v Speaker 5>overweight guy and you decided to go to </v>

2440
02:03:32.410 --> 02:03:34.250
<v Speaker 5>the gym for your New Year's resolution.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like you don't.</v>

2441
02:03:34.900 --> 02:03:39.900
<v Speaker 5>You go twice and then you stop and it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>because you can't create your own </v>

2442
02:03:39.900 --> 02:03:39.900
<v Speaker 5>values,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2443
02:03:39.900 --> 02:03:41.300
<v Speaker 5>It's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're not your own slave.</v>

2444
02:03:41.630 --> 02:03:44.330
<v Speaker 5>You can't just tell yourself what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You have a nature.</v>

2445
02:03:45.110 --> 02:03:48.800
<v Speaker 5>And so young's idea was while that we </v>
<v Speaker 5>had to go back to the mythology,</v>

2446
02:03:48.920 --> 02:03:50.420
<v Speaker 5>we had to go back to the stories.</v>

2447
02:03:50.540 --> 02:03:55.540
<v Speaker 5>We had to go back into the underground </v>
<v Speaker 5>unconscious chaos and lift out what we </v>

2448
02:03:55.551 --> 02:04:00.551
<v Speaker 5>had forgotten and that's what he was </v>
<v Speaker 5>trying to do with his psychology and </v>

2449
02:04:00.551 --> 02:04:01.940
<v Speaker 5>he's done it very effectively.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The very,</v>

2450
02:04:01.941 --> 02:04:06.941
<v Speaker 5>very effectively.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was a revolutionary thinker but very </v>

2451
02:04:06.941 --> 02:04:10.691
<v Speaker 5>difficult to understand.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so I've been working with ewing's </v>

2452
02:04:10.691 --> 02:04:13.561
<v Speaker 5>ideas for a long time trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would say make them more rational and </v>

2453
02:04:14.791 --> 02:04:17.390
<v Speaker 5>articulate.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not Believe me,</v>

2454
02:04:17.391 --> 02:04:20.450
<v Speaker 5>that's no critique because every time I </v>
<v Speaker 5>go back to young,</v>

2455
02:04:20.790 --> 02:04:24.020
<v Speaker 5>which I do from time to time thinking </v>
<v Speaker 5>I've kind of mastered him.</v>

2456
02:04:24.021 --> 02:04:25.850
<v Speaker 5>I learned a bunch of stuff that I didn't</v>
<v Speaker 5>know.</v>

2457
02:04:26.420 --> 02:04:29.450
<v Speaker 5>So.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But so what I've been trying to do is to</v>

2458
02:04:29.451 --> 02:04:34.451
<v Speaker 5>resurrect God.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm trying to resurrect the dormant </v>

2459
02:04:34.451 --> 02:04:38.921
<v Speaker 5>logos,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I suppose if you have to put it that </v>

2460
02:04:38.921 --> 02:04:38.921
<v Speaker 5>way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's I'm trying to do</v>

2461
02:04:38.921 --> 02:04:43.100
<v Speaker 2>and it's mostly in mostly in men and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're starving for it because I could </v>

2462
02:04:43.100 --> 02:04:44.160
<v Speaker 2>mostly in men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2463
02:04:44.250 --> 02:04:49.250
<v Speaker 2>That just seems to be what's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like about 90 percent of my viewers on </v>

2464
02:04:49.250 --> 02:04:51.660
<v Speaker 2>youtube are men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then when I go speak publicly,</v>

2465
02:04:51.661 --> 02:04:53.700
<v Speaker 2>it's all men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the hell are they doing?</v>

2466
02:04:53.701 --> 02:04:55.770
<v Speaker 2>Come in to hear somebody speak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Men Don't do that,</v>

2467
02:04:55.771 --> 02:04:57.240
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Women do that.</v>

2468
02:04:58.110 --> 02:05:03.110
<v Speaker 2>And so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I talked to them about truth </v>

2469
02:05:03.110 --> 02:05:05.241
<v Speaker 2>and responsibility and their eyes light </v>
<v Speaker 2>up because it's like no one ever </v>

2470
02:05:05.241 --> 02:05:07.290
<v Speaker 2>mentioned that before and now it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just boggles my mind.</v>

2471
02:05:07.980 --> 02:05:10.530
<v Speaker 2>I'm asking you because I feel like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a.</v>

2472
02:05:10.920 --> 02:05:15.920
<v Speaker 2>That is a gigantic theme today that men </v>
<v Speaker 2>searching for some sort of reason or </v>

2473
02:05:17.791 --> 02:05:21.830
<v Speaker 2>some sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess without using,</v>

2474
02:05:21.930 --> 02:05:23.580
<v Speaker 2>without a better word,</v>
<v Speaker 2>path,</v>

2475
02:05:23.940 --> 02:05:27.180
<v Speaker 2>some sort of path.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it seems to be very,</v>

2476
02:05:27.181 --> 02:05:32.160
<v Speaker 2>very prevalent today in almost all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all walks of life.</v>

2477
02:05:32.880 --> 02:05:37.200
<v Speaker 2>Men feel disenfranchised with this world</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they find themselves stuck in.</v>

2478
02:05:37.560 --> 02:05:40.110
<v Speaker 2>There's a reason that superhero movies </v>
<v Speaker 2>are so popular,</v>

2479
02:05:40.880 --> 02:05:42.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's polytheism.</v>

2480
02:05:42.580 --> 02:05:45.750
<v Speaker 2>The return of polytheism for all intents</v>
<v Speaker 2>and purposes.</v>

2481
02:05:45.751 --> 02:05:47.010
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the hell are those things?</v>

2482
02:05:47.011 --> 02:05:52.011
<v Speaker 2>They're demigods.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obviously one of them is thor for God's </v>

2483
02:05:52.011 --> 02:05:52.011
<v Speaker 2>sake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean account more obvious.</v>

2484
02:05:52.011 --> 02:05:53.640
<v Speaker 2>Could it be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2485
02:05:53.641 --> 02:05:54.450
<v Speaker 2>and so the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You might say,</v>

2486
02:05:54.451 --> 02:05:56.280
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's the leader of the Demi Gods?</v>

2487
02:05:57.000 --> 02:05:58.860
<v Speaker 2>Because that's the person you really </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to follow,</v>

2488
02:05:59.610 --> 02:06:00.780
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2489
02:06:00.960 --> 02:06:01.440
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2490
02:06:01.441 --> 02:06:03.570
<v Speaker 2>the evolutionary answer to that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2491
02:06:03.660 --> 02:06:07.440
<v Speaker 2>the evolutionary answer to that as far </v>
<v Speaker 2>as the Christian route went,</v>

2492
02:06:07.470 --> 02:06:12.470
<v Speaker 2>was Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's been lots of embodiments of </v>

2493
02:06:12.470 --> 02:06:12.470
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For the Mesopotamians,</v>

2494
02:06:12.470 --> 02:06:15.030
<v Speaker 2>it was Marduk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Marduk was the savior figure.</v>

2495
02:06:15.031 --> 02:06:18.570
<v Speaker 2>He had eyes all the way around his head </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he spoke magic words.</v>

2496
02:06:18.750 --> 02:06:20.880
<v Speaker 2>That was his fund.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what made them different from all</v>

2497
02:06:20.881 --> 02:06:21.660
<v Speaker 2>the other gods.</v>

2498
02:06:21.990 --> 02:06:26.990
<v Speaker 2>And he was elected by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>other than all the other gods to be </v>

2499
02:06:26.990 --> 02:06:29.571
<v Speaker 2>their king.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he went out and fought tie </v>

2500
02:06:29.571 --> 02:06:31.940
<v Speaker 2>matt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's a great dragon and made the world </v>

2501
02:06:31.940 --> 02:06:34.761
<v Speaker 2>out of her pieces.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of his names was he who makes </v>

2502
02:06:34.761 --> 02:06:35.340
<v Speaker 2>ingenious things out of the combat with </v>
<v Speaker 2>Time Matt.</v>

2503
02:06:35.610 --> 02:06:40.610
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what human beings do is they go </v>

2504
02:06:40.610 --> 02:06:40.610
<v Speaker 2>out into the unknown,</v>
<v Speaker 2>into chaos,</v>

2505
02:06:40.610 --> 02:06:41.400
<v Speaker 2>and they make ingenious things out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

2506
02:06:41.970 --> 02:06:46.970
<v Speaker 2>That's what we do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so that he's the found Marduk was </v>

2507
02:06:46.970 --> 02:06:46.970
<v Speaker 2>the founder of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

2508
02:06:46.970 --> 02:06:51.250
<v Speaker 2>of Mesopotamian civilization,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you could think about all those </v>

2509
02:06:51.250 --> 02:06:51.840
<v Speaker 2>tribes came together to make </v>
<v Speaker 2>Mesopotamia.</v>

2510
02:06:52.100 --> 02:06:57.100
<v Speaker 2>They will have to God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so then those gods went to war and </v>

2511
02:06:57.100 --> 02:06:59.730
<v Speaker 2>out of that war of God's image,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God emerged.</v>

2512
02:06:59.750 --> 02:07:04.750
<v Speaker 2>That was Martin and Martin is one of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>sources for the figure of Christ that </v>

2513
02:07:04.750 --> 02:07:06.810
<v Speaker 2>happened all over the place like you see</v>
<v Speaker 2>the admirable man.</v>

2514
02:07:07.200 --> 02:07:08.970
<v Speaker 2>Then you see 10 out broomball Ben and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you think,</v>

2515
02:07:08.971 --> 02:07:10.650
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those guys have something in common.</v>

2516
02:07:11.340 --> 02:07:16.340
<v Speaker 2>That's what you remember about Muci.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You remember the heroic things they've </v>

2517
02:07:16.340 --> 02:07:19.911
<v Speaker 2>done because they stick in your memory </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they fit the pattern and then </v>

2518
02:07:19.911 --> 02:07:23.841
<v Speaker 2>you start telling the story about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>heroic things that a bunch of them did </v>

2519
02:07:23.841 --> 02:07:26.871
<v Speaker 2>it all that mail debates together and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then you come out with your culture </v>

2520
02:07:26.871 --> 02:07:26.871
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your God.</v>

2521
02:07:26.871 --> 02:07:29.640
<v Speaker 2>Now there's like 50 tribes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they each have their own gods,</v>

2522
02:07:29.641 --> 02:07:30.810
<v Speaker 2>will all the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you going to do?</v>

2523
02:07:30.811 --> 02:07:35.811
<v Speaker 2>Then the gods go to war over centuries </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then they elect new God Marduk and </v>

2524
02:07:36.511 --> 02:07:41.511
<v Speaker 2>in the case of the Mesopotamians and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's the thing that goes out and fights </v>

2525
02:07:41.511 --> 02:07:43.780
<v Speaker 2>the dragon of chaos can makes the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

2526
02:07:43.781 --> 02:07:45.790
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's exactly what he is.</v>

2527
02:07:46.450 --> 02:07:50.350
<v Speaker 2>You do that with truth because truth </v>
<v Speaker 2>introduces you to chaos.</v>

2528
02:07:50.830 --> 02:07:55.830
<v Speaker 2>Why do you think though it's so much of </v>
<v Speaker 2>an issue with males as opposed to </v>

2529
02:07:55.830 --> 02:07:57.760
<v Speaker 2>females in our society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe females already have enough to do.</v>

2530
02:07:58.900 --> 02:08:00.130
<v Speaker 2>Really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really like maybe.</v>

2531
02:08:00.160 --> 02:08:02.380
<v Speaker 2>Maybe men have to take this on </v>
<v Speaker 2>voluntarily.</v>

2532
02:08:02.830 --> 02:08:05.200
<v Speaker 2>That's what it looks like to me because </v>
<v Speaker 2>like you can,</v>

2533
02:08:05.380 --> 02:08:09.850
<v Speaker 2>you can screw around til you're 50.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could still have a family,</v>

2534
02:08:09.970 --> 02:08:14.970
<v Speaker 2>you've got time and you can sit down and</v>
<v Speaker 2>do nothing if you want.</v>

2535
02:08:15.190 --> 02:08:20.190
<v Speaker 2>You can do it so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you shouldn't because it's horrible </v>

2536
02:08:20.190 --> 02:08:25.051
<v Speaker 2>to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People who do it know it like it's </v>

2537
02:08:25.051 --> 02:08:25.051
<v Speaker 2>meaningless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's wild.</v>

2538
02:08:25.051 --> 02:08:26.230
<v Speaker 2>It's funny thing about meaninglessness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This.</v>

2539
02:08:26.260 --> 02:08:28.990
<v Speaker 2>There's no such thing when people say </v>
<v Speaker 2>their lives aren't,</v>

2540
02:08:29.180 --> 02:08:30.760
<v Speaker 2>are meaningless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that isn't what they mean.</v>

2541
02:08:31.240 --> 02:08:34.450
<v Speaker 2>They mean I'm in pain and anxious all </v>
<v Speaker 2>the time.</v>

2542
02:08:35.080 --> 02:08:36.730
<v Speaker 2>That's what they mean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are meanings,</v>

2543
02:08:36.731 --> 02:08:38.860
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't get neutral,</v>

2544
02:08:38.880 --> 02:08:39.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just sitting around.</v>

2545
02:08:39.940 --> 02:08:41.200
<v Speaker 2>I'm not feeling anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

2546
02:08:41.201 --> 02:08:41.820
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2547
02:08:41.840 --> 02:08:46.840
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry that doesn't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you say do nothing that your </v>

2548
02:08:47.351 --> 02:08:49.480
<v Speaker 2>life is meaningless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're doing nothing,</v>

2549
02:08:49.970 --> 02:08:51.970
<v Speaker 2>what do you mean by doing nothing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2550
02:08:51.971 --> 02:08:55.090
<v Speaker 2>by not accepting any response,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by not lifting a great load,</v>

2551
02:08:55.091 --> 02:08:57.190
<v Speaker 2>by not acting out the archetype of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hero,</v>

2552
02:08:57.191 --> 02:08:59.170
<v Speaker 2>that's what people are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where men are.</v>

2553
02:08:59.650 --> 02:09:02.650
<v Speaker 2>If there's anything there or </v>
<v Speaker 2>mythological heroes,</v>

2554
02:09:02.651 --> 02:09:05.500
<v Speaker 2>if there anything through some path,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is,</v>

2555
02:09:05.530 --> 02:09:07.150
<v Speaker 2>lots of paths mean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So look,</v>

2556
02:09:07.151 --> 02:09:12.151
<v Speaker 2>there's an old mid evil idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the idea of the imitation of </v>

2557
02:09:12.151 --> 02:09:15.631
<v Speaker 2>Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is something that young elaborates </v>

2558
02:09:15.631 --> 02:09:15.631
<v Speaker 2>on a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

2559
02:09:15.631 --> 02:09:19.050
<v Speaker 2>he believed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is one of the things that he said </v>

2560
02:09:19.050 --> 02:09:19.900
<v Speaker 2>was that you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're the proper goal of a Christian.</v>

2561
02:09:20.050 --> 02:09:25.050
<v Speaker 2>Roughly speaking is to enact the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Meta pattern of Christ's life in </v>

2562
02:09:26.501 --> 02:09:29.290
<v Speaker 2>their own to make it their own story.</v>

2563
02:09:29.530 --> 02:09:31.720
<v Speaker 2>And so what did he mean by that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2564
02:09:31.721 --> 02:09:35.080
<v Speaker 2>part of it is c,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that characterizes the</v>

2565
02:09:35.081 --> 02:09:37.090
<v Speaker 2>mythological figure of Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

2566
02:09:37.091 --> 02:09:40.510
<v Speaker 2>is that he takes on the burden of </v>
<v Speaker 2>mortality voluntarily.</v>

2567
02:09:41.460 --> 02:09:44.410
<v Speaker 2>He accepts it as a precondition of </v>
<v Speaker 2>existence.</v>

2568
02:09:45.220 --> 02:09:47.770
<v Speaker 2>And we have to do that because otherwise</v>
<v Speaker 2>we get resentful.</v>

2569
02:09:48.220 --> 02:09:50.200
<v Speaker 2>Like life is hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Make no mistake about it.</v>

2570
02:09:50.530 --> 02:09:52.540
<v Speaker 2>People's lives are tragic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2571
02:09:52.541 --> 02:09:57.541
<v Speaker 2>if you pick a random person off the </v>
<v Speaker 2>street and you ask them about their </v>

2572
02:09:57.541 --> 02:09:57.541
<v Speaker 2>life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

2573
02:09:57.541 --> 02:09:57.930
<v Speaker 2>usually there's things that have </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened there.</v>

2574
02:09:58.590 --> 02:10:01.150
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just beggar the imagination.</v>

2575
02:10:01.180 --> 02:10:03.940
<v Speaker 2>It's no wonder people are angry and </v>
<v Speaker 2>resentful and bitter.</v>

2576
02:10:04.660 --> 02:10:09.660
<v Speaker 2>But the way out of that is to accept it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to accept your mortality and that helps </v>

2577
02:10:09.701 --> 02:10:14.701
<v Speaker 2>you transcend it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's partly what the crucifix symbol </v>

2578
02:10:14.701 --> 02:10:14.701
<v Speaker 2>means because it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

2579
02:10:14.701 --> 02:10:19.100
<v Speaker 2>it was accepted voluntarily.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to accept your death </v>

2580
02:10:19.100 --> 02:10:19.100
<v Speaker 2>voluntarily.</v>

2581
02:10:19.100 --> 02:10:24.060
<v Speaker 2>That's part of the path of the hero.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a very difficult thing to do </v>

2582
02:10:24.060 --> 02:10:24.580
<v Speaker 2>obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obviously.</v>

2583
02:10:24.850 --> 02:10:27.450
<v Speaker 2>What's your alternative?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obviously,</v>

2584
02:10:27.660 --> 02:10:32.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think people are constantly searching </v>

2585
02:10:32.660 --> 02:10:35.420
<v Speaker 2>for that thing that you just described.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The thing of meaning,</v>

2586
02:10:35.680 --> 02:10:40.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>having meaning in this life and that </v>

2587
02:10:40.680 --> 02:10:41.180
<v Speaker 2>meaning has a different definition for </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody.</v>

2588
02:10:41.420 --> 02:10:46.420
<v Speaker 2>I mean everybody's meaning your meaning </v>
<v Speaker 2>might be very different than mine or </v>

2589
02:10:46.420 --> 02:10:49.760
<v Speaker 2>Jamie's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You kind of have to have your own path </v>

2590
02:10:49.760 --> 02:10:52.421
<v Speaker 2>and I think that's also one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>reasons why people are so confused is </v>

2591
02:10:52.421 --> 02:10:55.841
<v Speaker 2>because you're thrust into an early age </v>
<v Speaker 2>to a very rigid system of education and </v>

2592
02:10:56.601 --> 02:11:01.601
<v Speaker 2>then have jobs and then of career </v>
<v Speaker 2>structure where you're in this place and</v>

2593
02:11:02.691 --> 02:11:06.440
<v Speaker 2>most people don't feel like that's what </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're supposed to be doing and we feel</v>

2594
02:11:06.441 --> 02:11:10.430
<v Speaker 2>very alienated by the very structure of </v>
<v Speaker 2>society that we are embedded in.</v>

2595
02:11:10.460 --> 02:11:11.510
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course.</v>

2596
02:11:11.511 --> 02:11:16.511
<v Speaker 2>Well one of the no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's two primary masculine </v>

2597
02:11:16.511 --> 02:11:19.661
<v Speaker 2>mythological figures and one is the wise</v>
<v Speaker 2>king and the other is the king who </v>

2598
02:11:19.661 --> 02:11:22.800
<v Speaker 2>devours his own son.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the district.</v>

2599
02:11:22.820 --> 02:11:25.130
<v Speaker 2>That's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the patriarchy that the feminists</v>

2600
02:11:25.131 --> 02:11:26.210
<v Speaker 2>are always talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2601
02:11:26.211 --> 02:11:29.240
<v Speaker 2>of course it's always there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So society is a destructive force.</v>

2602
02:11:29.241 --> 02:11:31.280
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't care about you as an </v>
<v Speaker 2>individual.</v>

2603
02:11:31.880 --> 02:11:36.880
<v Speaker 2>It needs you to be part of society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It needs you to adopt the norms and to </v>

2604
02:11:36.880 --> 02:11:40.781
<v Speaker 2>squelch your peculiar individuality and </v>
<v Speaker 2>be a cog and to be socialized and you </v>

2605
02:11:41.511 --> 02:11:45.670
<v Speaker 2>know to him yourself in and control </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself and not be impulsive and yeah,</v>

2606
02:11:45.740 --> 02:11:47.780
<v Speaker 2>it's a tyrant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the thing is,</v>

2607
02:11:47.781 --> 02:11:51.170
<v Speaker 2>society isn't only a tyrant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing.</v>

2608
02:11:51.530 --> 02:11:53.630
<v Speaker 2>It's like how about a little gratitude </v>
<v Speaker 2>in there?</v>

2609
02:11:54.020 --> 02:11:59.020
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know people have a hard time with </v>

2610
02:11:59.020 --> 02:11:59.020
<v Speaker 2>this because we like it when a thing is </v>
<v Speaker 2>only one thing,</v>

2611
02:11:59.420 --> 02:12:01.340
<v Speaker 2>but society is always two things.</v>

2612
02:12:01.940 --> 02:12:05.300
<v Speaker 2>It's the thing that alienates you and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing that you're benevolent.</v>

2613
02:12:05.301 --> 02:12:10.301
<v Speaker 2>Father always now tilt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes it tilts harder towards the </v>

2614
02:12:10.301 --> 02:12:14.090
<v Speaker 2>tyrant and now it's not so good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's an archetypal reality.</v>

2615
02:12:14.540 --> 02:12:16.880
<v Speaker 2>So what do you have to contend with in </v>
<v Speaker 2>life?</v>

2616
02:12:16.940 --> 02:12:21.940
<v Speaker 2>This is why these are architectural </v>
<v Speaker 2>realities because everyone has to </v>

2617
02:12:21.940 --> 02:12:24.491
<v Speaker 2>contend with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to contend with yourself and </v>

2618
02:12:24.491 --> 02:12:27.641
<v Speaker 2>the adversary that's inside you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that seems to oppose your every </v>

2619
02:12:27.641 --> 02:12:29.150
<v Speaker 2>movement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fact that you're not,</v>

2620
02:12:29.810 --> 02:12:34.810
<v Speaker 2>that you just can't move forward </v>
<v Speaker 2>smoothly through life without being in </v>

2621
02:12:34.810 --> 02:12:38.321
<v Speaker 2>conflict with yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's a hero in the adversary on </v>

2622
02:12:38.321 --> 02:12:38.570
<v Speaker 2>the individual level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then on the social level,</v>

2623
02:12:38.571 --> 02:12:41.780
<v Speaker 2>there's the wise king and the tyrant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're always gonna run into that.</v>

2624
02:12:41.781 --> 02:12:43.820
<v Speaker 2>I don't care if you're a Bantu tribes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Manura,</v>

2625
02:12:44.320 --> 02:12:49.320
<v Speaker 2>a New York lawyer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all those things you're going to run </v>

2626
02:12:49.320 --> 02:12:53.861
<v Speaker 2>into.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then in the natural world you're </v>

2627
02:12:53.861 --> 02:12:53.861
<v Speaker 2>going to run into destructive element of</v>
<v Speaker 2>nature,</v>

2628
02:12:53.861 --> 02:12:53.861
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2629
02:12:53.861 --> 02:12:54.890
<v Speaker 2>That's the Gorgon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get you,</v>

2630
02:12:55.160 --> 02:12:58.790
<v Speaker 2>you let that thing get a glance at you </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're one like frozen poppy.</v>

2631
02:12:59.060 --> 02:13:01.880
<v Speaker 2>But also there's the benevolent element </v>
<v Speaker 2>of nature that's feminine,</v>

2632
02:13:01.881 --> 02:13:04.580
<v Speaker 2>that's Mother Nature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Both of those extremes.</v>

2633
02:13:05.270 --> 02:13:08.510
<v Speaker 2>So and that's the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the archetypal world.</v>

2634
02:13:08.960 --> 02:13:12.350
<v Speaker 2>And it's because it's eternal as far as </v>
<v Speaker 2>human beings are concerned,</v>

2635
02:13:12.351 --> 02:13:15.050
<v Speaker 2>those things are always there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's our true environment.</v>

2636
02:13:15.410 --> 02:13:17.830
<v Speaker 2>It's not these things we see around us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are,</v>

2637
02:13:17.970 --> 02:13:19.340
<v Speaker 2>they're lasting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no time.</v>

2638
02:13:20.120 --> 02:13:25.120
<v Speaker 2>These other things last forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what we're adapted to where </v>

2639
02:13:25.120 --> 02:13:26.480
<v Speaker 2>we're adapted to the things that last </v>
<v Speaker 2>forever.</v>

2640
02:13:27.530 --> 02:13:32.530
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yet we go through this finite life </v>

2641
02:13:32.530 --> 02:13:33.250
<v Speaker 2>searching for meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2642
02:13:33.320 --> 02:13:37.770
<v Speaker 2>and it's funny to note where meaning </v>
<v Speaker 2>seems to locate itself.</v>

2643
02:13:38.400 --> 02:13:40.590
<v Speaker 2>You want a meaning that justifies the </v>
<v Speaker 2>suffering.</v>

2644
02:13:41.820 --> 02:13:44.370
<v Speaker 2>It's something like that that's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>transcendent meaning.</v>

2645
02:13:44.371 --> 02:13:45.960
<v Speaker 2>It's like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is hard,</v>

2646
02:13:46.200 --> 02:13:47.040
<v Speaker 2>but it's worth it.</v>

2647
02:13:47.370 --> 02:13:48.300
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what do you do?</v>

2648
02:13:48.510 --> 02:13:50.850
<v Speaker 2>Pick something worth it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2649
02:13:50.940 --> 02:13:54.270
<v Speaker 2>That's partly what I tried to get people</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do with that future authoring program</v>

2650
02:13:54.780 --> 02:13:55.350
<v Speaker 2>to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2651
02:13:55.351 --> 02:13:56.730
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's a place to start.</v>

2652
02:13:57.970 --> 02:14:02.650
<v Speaker 2>You got your miserable self right now </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like three to five years out.</v>

2653
02:14:03.760 --> 02:14:08.760
<v Speaker 2>Imagine what your life could be like if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you had what you would give yourself if </v>

2654
02:14:08.760 --> 02:14:11.560
<v Speaker 2>you were taking care of yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would life be like?</v>

2655
02:14:11.830 --> 02:14:16.830
<v Speaker 2>Just come up with an idea even about </v>
<v Speaker 2>that and so then people do that and then</v>

2656
02:14:17.681 --> 02:14:22.681
<v Speaker 2>they write out a plan to attain it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then the college kids are like 30 </v>

2657
02:14:22.681 --> 02:14:24.310
<v Speaker 2>percent more likely to stay in </v>
<v Speaker 2>university if they do that,</v>

2658
02:14:24.311 --> 02:14:27.640
<v Speaker 2>especially if they're men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because men need a purpose.</v>

2659
02:14:28.570 --> 02:14:32.740
<v Speaker 2>I think women have a purpose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are they now they have two purposes.</v>

2660
02:14:32.741 --> 02:14:35.320
<v Speaker 2>You know they're going to have a family.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a major purpose man.</v>

2661
02:14:35.740 --> 02:14:37.090
<v Speaker 2>Like just give birth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>

2662
02:14:37.091 --> 02:14:40.060
<v Speaker 2>That's no joke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you're devoted to something for</v>

2663
02:14:40.061 --> 02:14:42.760
<v Speaker 2>like 20 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got your adventure right there.</v>

2664
02:14:43.610 --> 02:14:46.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of women find great offense in</v>

2665
02:14:46.381 --> 02:14:51.381
<v Speaker 1>someone's saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially a man saying that </v>

2666
02:14:51.381 --> 02:14:51.381
<v Speaker 1>mansplaining,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that a woman's purpose is to breed.</v>

2667
02:14:51.381 --> 02:14:51.470
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2668
02:14:51.471 --> 02:14:53.720
<v Speaker 1>isn't that a giant issue that a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>women have?</v>

2669
02:14:54.150 --> 02:14:56.870
<v Speaker 1>I didn't say that was the only purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that you didn't.</v>

2670
02:14:57.140 --> 02:14:58.700
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People have an issue with it,</v>

2671
02:14:58.701 --> 02:15:00.970
<v Speaker 2>but it's like grow up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2672
02:15:01.070 --> 02:15:03.680
<v Speaker 2>if you're a sophisticated person as far </v>
<v Speaker 2>as I'm concerned,</v>

2673
02:15:07.430 --> 02:15:09.170
<v Speaker 2>how many important things are there in </v>
<v Speaker 2>life?</v>

2674
02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:12.200
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of them is family.</v>

2675
02:15:13.030 --> 02:15:15.050
<v Speaker 2>Like it's as simple as that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you might say,</v>

2676
02:15:15.051 --> 02:15:16.910
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>family isn't the end all solution.</v>

2677
02:15:16.911 --> 02:15:17.360
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2678
02:15:17.361 --> 02:15:18.920
<v Speaker 2>well thanks for pointing that out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2679
02:15:19.820 --> 02:15:21.890
<v Speaker 2>I've dealt with plenty of pathological </v>
<v Speaker 2>families,</v>

2680
02:15:22.160 --> 02:15:25.070
<v Speaker 2>but it's a huge part of life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have a mother and a father,</v>

2681
02:15:25.071 --> 02:15:30.071
<v Speaker 2>you have children.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It places you in the world and any </v>

2682
02:15:30.071 --> 02:15:30.071
<v Speaker 2>society that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

2683
02:15:30.071 --> 02:15:33.470
<v Speaker 2>there's a reason society's worship the </v>
<v Speaker 2>virgin mother and the child.</v>

2684
02:15:33.950 --> 02:15:38.150
<v Speaker 2>It's because societies that don't die </v>
<v Speaker 2>and so people say,</v>

2685
02:15:38.151 --> 02:15:38.840
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2686
02:15:38.841 --> 02:15:41.750
<v Speaker 2>that relationship between mother and </v>
<v Speaker 2>child isn't the only thing.</v>

2687
02:15:41.751 --> 02:15:42.470
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fine.</v>

2688
02:15:42.471 --> 02:15:45.350
<v Speaker 2>It's still a sacred thing and you miss </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

2689
02:15:45.380 --> 02:15:46.670
<v Speaker 2>You miss it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're female,</v>

2690
02:15:46.671 --> 02:15:48.410
<v Speaker 2>you miss that at your peril.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

2691
02:15:48.411 --> 02:15:53.411
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't mean there aren't women who</v>
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't miss it because maybe they </v>

2692
02:15:53.411 --> 02:15:54.080
<v Speaker 2>have another purpose that's that </v>
<v Speaker 2>transcends that,</v>

2693
02:15:54.350 --> 02:15:56.420
<v Speaker 2>but that's rare.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very,</v>

2694
02:15:56.421 --> 02:16:00.890
<v Speaker 2>very rare and I would caution any women </v>
<v Speaker 2>listening if they're young,</v>

2695
02:16:01.220 --> 02:16:04.640
<v Speaker 2>not to be diluted into the idea that </v>
<v Speaker 2>their career is,</v>

2696
02:16:04.641 --> 02:16:06.860
<v Speaker 2>that will be up such high quality that </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's self.</v>

2697
02:16:06.861 --> 02:16:11.861
<v Speaker 2>Evidently trump's having a family.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to have a hell of a career </v>

2698
02:16:11.861 --> 02:16:14.540
<v Speaker 2>before that's the case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

2699
02:16:16.620 --> 02:16:19.350
<v Speaker 1>don't you think that's unique to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual though that some people just,</v>

2700
02:16:19.920 --> 02:16:24.920
<v Speaker 1>they'll be more satisfied and I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>depending on what they're doing </v>

2701
02:16:24.920 --> 02:16:26.190
<v Speaker 1>artistically or creatively or whatever </v>
<v Speaker 1>it is,</v>

2702
02:16:26.370 --> 02:16:28.380
<v Speaker 1>you can't make rules for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>exceptional,</v>

2703
02:16:28.570 --> 02:16:29.650
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2704
02:16:29.680 --> 02:16:30.010
<v Speaker 1>they do</v>

2705
02:16:30.010 --> 02:16:31.390
<v Speaker 2>what they're going to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are open.</v>

2706
02:16:31.450 --> 02:16:33.880
<v Speaker 2>Maybe those are open people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have genius level Iq,</v>

2707
02:16:33.881 --> 02:16:38.881
<v Speaker 2>like they're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're spectacular in some manner and </v>

2708
02:16:38.881 --> 02:16:39.850
<v Speaker 2>so there's a reason they're going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>step outside the norm.</v>

2709
02:16:40.030 --> 02:16:42.130
<v Speaker 2>They're shape shifters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no problem.</v>

2710
02:16:42.310 --> 02:16:44.280
<v Speaker 2>There's always gonna be people like that</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we need them.</v>

2711
02:16:44.400 --> 02:16:49.400
<v Speaker 2>How they know when they're that well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>telling the truth is a good start </v>

2712
02:16:49.780 --> 02:16:51.940
<v Speaker 2>because then you don't fool yourself </v>
<v Speaker 2>about who you are.</v>

2713
02:16:52.880 --> 02:16:55.180
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's another one of the things I tried</v>

2714
02:16:55.181 --> 02:16:58.780
<v Speaker 2>to think through is why you should tell </v>
<v Speaker 2>the truth so it's not self evident,</v>

2715
02:16:58.781 --> 02:16:59.770
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>smart kid.</v>

2716
02:16:59.800 --> 02:17:01.810
<v Speaker 2>The smarter the kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the earlier they learn to lie.</v>

2717
02:17:02.560 --> 02:17:07.560
<v Speaker 2>Lying is very powerful because you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>manipulate the world with your language </v>

2718
02:17:07.560 --> 02:17:11.820
<v Speaker 2>and then you can get what you want lots </v>
<v Speaker 2>of times or escape from things that you </v>

2719
02:17:11.820 --> 02:17:12.190
<v Speaker 2>don't want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So why not lie all the time?</v>

2720
02:17:13.270 --> 02:17:15.070
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the reason is there's a bunch of</v>

2721
02:17:15.071 --> 02:17:20.071
<v Speaker 2>reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but one of the myths is that you can't </v>

2722
02:17:20.071 --> 02:17:20.140
<v Speaker 2>trust yourself if you lie and there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to be times in your life where you</v>

2723
02:17:20.141 --> 02:17:25.141
<v Speaker 2>have no one to turn to except you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so if you've stuffed yourself full </v>

2724
02:17:25.141 --> 02:17:28.981
<v Speaker 2>of lies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you're going to be in a crisis one </v>

2725
02:17:28.981 --> 02:17:31.051
<v Speaker 2>day and you're going to have to make a </v>
<v Speaker 2>decision and you're going to decide </v>

2726
02:17:31.051 --> 02:17:33.391
<v Speaker 2>wrong and you're going to be in real </v>
<v Speaker 2>trouble because you won't have the </v>

2727
02:17:33.391 --> 02:17:36.721
<v Speaker 2>clarity of mind necessary to make the </v>
<v Speaker 2>proper judgment because you've filled </v>

2728
02:17:36.721 --> 02:17:39.160
<v Speaker 2>your imagination and your perception </v>
<v Speaker 2>with with rubbish.</v>

2729
02:17:40.750 --> 02:17:42.190
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if you really think that through,</v>

2730
02:17:42.191 --> 02:17:47.191
<v Speaker 2>you see there's this old idea in the old</v>
<v Speaker 2>testament that fear of God is the </v>

2731
02:17:47.191 --> 02:17:48.220
<v Speaker 2>beginning of wisdom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I kind of understand what that means</v>

2732
02:17:49.420 --> 02:17:52.090
<v Speaker 2>because one of the things say we do with</v>
<v Speaker 2>the future authoring program,</v>

2733
02:17:52.450 --> 02:17:53.830
<v Speaker 2>we offer people a little heaven.</v>

2734
02:17:53.860 --> 02:17:54.550
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2735
02:17:55.540 --> 02:17:59.290
<v Speaker 2>construct your ideal aim added.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Come up with a plan.</v>

2736
02:17:59.620 --> 02:18:01.270
<v Speaker 2>You get a modify the plan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no problem.</v>

2737
02:18:01.480 --> 02:18:03.700
<v Speaker 2>You're going to do a bad job of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No problem.</v>

2738
02:18:03.790 --> 02:18:05.440
<v Speaker 2>Just do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

2739
02:18:05.441 --> 02:18:08.830
<v Speaker 2>So then now you've got a goal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and now you're approach systems.</v>

2740
02:18:09.100 --> 02:18:14.100
<v Speaker 2>Technically speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the positive emotion systems that </v>

2741
02:18:14.100 --> 02:18:16.831
<v Speaker 2>motivate you are you are engaged because</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're engaged in relationship to a </v>

2742
02:18:16.831 --> 02:18:18.370
<v Speaker 2>goal and the more transcendent goal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more they're engaged.</v>

2743
02:18:18.730 --> 02:18:23.730
<v Speaker 2>But that's not good enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's great to run towards something you </v>

2744
02:18:23.730 --> 02:18:27.011
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's even better to run away from </v>

2745
02:18:27.011 --> 02:18:27.011
<v Speaker 2>something that terrifies you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then we ask people,</v>

2746
02:18:27.011 --> 02:18:27.520
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so here,</v>

2747
02:18:27.521 --> 02:18:32.521
<v Speaker 2>think about this real carefully.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Take all your faults and your </v>

2748
02:18:32.521 --> 02:18:34.210
<v Speaker 2>inadequacies and your hatred for life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of that,</v>

2749
02:18:34.870 --> 02:18:39.870
<v Speaker 2>and then imagine that gets the upper </v>
<v Speaker 2>hand and then think about where you </v>

2750
02:18:39.870 --> 02:18:40.180
<v Speaker 2>could be in three to five years.</v>

2751
02:18:40.540 --> 02:18:41.580
<v Speaker 2>Everyone knows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

2752
02:18:42.100 --> 02:18:43.960
<v Speaker 2>some people know they'd be a street </v>
<v Speaker 2>person,</v>

2753
02:18:43.961 --> 02:18:48.961
<v Speaker 2>some people know they'd be an alcoholic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people know they'd be a prostitute </v>

2754
02:18:48.961 --> 02:18:52.201
<v Speaker 2>or a drug addict,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like everybody's got their own little </v>

2755
02:18:52.201 --> 02:18:54.751
<v Speaker 2>hell they could descend into with a fair</v>
<v Speaker 2>degree of rapidity and a fair bit of </v>

2756
02:18:54.751 --> 02:18:56.440
<v Speaker 2>enjoyment and people know that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I say,</v>

2757
02:18:56.441 --> 02:18:57.970
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>delineate that out too.</v>

2758
02:18:58.300 --> 02:19:01.510
<v Speaker 2>So you know where you're headed when you</v>
<v Speaker 2>fall off the path.</v>

2759
02:19:02.170 --> 02:19:04.600
<v Speaker 2>And so then you're running away and </v>
<v Speaker 2>running towards like,</v>

2760
02:19:04.601 --> 02:19:05.890
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's heaven.</v>

2761
02:19:05.891 --> 02:19:09.160
<v Speaker 2>Inhale and you need it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're real.</v>

2762
02:19:09.490 --> 02:19:11.200
<v Speaker 2>They're as real as anything that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can.</v>

2763
02:19:12.910 --> 02:19:15.490
<v Speaker 2>It depends on what you mean by a real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I suppose,</v>

2764
02:19:15.520 --> 02:19:20.520
<v Speaker 2>but there's real as you make them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How about that and people can make hell </v>

2765
02:19:20.891 --> 02:19:25.891
<v Speaker 2>pretty real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People do seem to construct these </v>

2766
02:19:25.891 --> 02:19:26.560
<v Speaker 2>pitfalls for themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2767
02:19:26.561 --> 02:19:31.561
<v Speaker 2>self sabotage is one of the most common </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that you find in people that are </v>

2768
02:19:32.511 --> 02:19:33.110
<v Speaker 2>struggling.</v>

2769
02:19:34.210 --> 02:19:39.210
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would think that someone who is </v>

2770
02:19:39.210 --> 02:19:40.460
<v Speaker 2>struggling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the last thing they'd want to do is help</v>

2771
02:19:40.461 --> 02:19:44.690
<v Speaker 2>themselves towards their own demise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's super common.</v>

2772
02:19:45.080 --> 02:19:46.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I thought about that too,</v>

2773
02:19:46.971 --> 02:19:50.990
<v Speaker 2>and so you tell me what you think about </v>
<v Speaker 2>this as if you talked to people.</v>

2774
02:19:50.991 --> 02:19:51.500
<v Speaker 2>They say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2775
02:19:51.501 --> 02:19:55.070
<v Speaker 2>I want to have a meaningful life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Generally people want that,</v>

2776
02:19:55.640 --> 02:19:57.680
<v Speaker 2>but then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well then why aren't you?</v>

2777
02:19:58.490 --> 02:19:59.240
<v Speaker 2>And then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2778
02:19:59.241 --> 02:20:00.770
<v Speaker 2>what does it mean to have a meaningful </v>
<v Speaker 2>life?</v>

2779
02:20:00.771 --> 02:20:02.600
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you think,</v>

2780
02:20:02.601 --> 02:20:07.601
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe it means that you have to take on </v>

2781
02:20:07.601 --> 02:20:09.371
<v Speaker 2>responsibility because you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your sacrifices have to be worth </v>

2782
02:20:09.371 --> 02:20:09.371
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2783
02:20:09.371 --> 02:20:11.360
<v Speaker 2>It has to have some cows to have some </v>
<v Speaker 2>meat.</v>

2784
02:20:11.570 --> 02:20:16.570
<v Speaker 2>What you're aiming at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has to be something that can elevate </v>

2785
02:20:16.570 --> 02:20:19.070
<v Speaker 2>your worm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like self to the level of tolerability.</v>

2786
02:20:19.370 --> 02:20:20.060
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can say,</v>

2787
02:20:20.061 --> 02:20:21.410
<v Speaker 2>well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got all these flaws,</v>

2788
02:20:21.411 --> 02:20:25.890
<v Speaker 2>but look at what I'm trying to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the real ground of self respect.</v>

2789
02:20:26.720 --> 02:20:27.050
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2790
02:20:32.040 --> 02:20:34.680
<v Speaker 2>I missed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm off the track with the question.</v>

2791
02:20:35.030 --> 02:20:37.680
<v Speaker 2>Ground of self respect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember what you asked me,</v>

2792
02:20:38.700 --> 02:20:41.550
<v Speaker 2>so we'll have to go to a different </v>
<v Speaker 2>topic.</v>

2793
02:20:43.240 --> 02:20:43.960
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

2794
02:20:44.040 --> 02:20:46.230
<v Speaker 2>how did we get on this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were um,</v>

2795
02:20:46.710 --> 02:20:49.530
<v Speaker 2>you asked about the evolutionary basis </v>
<v Speaker 2>of.</v>

2796
02:20:51.080 --> 02:20:56.080
<v Speaker 2>That was a long time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know it's a rabbit hole that just </v>

2797
02:20:56.080 --> 02:20:58.851
<v Speaker 2>doesn't disappear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But where will we just now remember </v>

2798
02:20:58.851 --> 02:21:00.440
<v Speaker 2>where we were just now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2799
02:21:00.570 --> 02:21:05.570
<v Speaker 2>sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Distracted by something else that's </v>

2800
02:21:05.570 --> 02:21:05.570
<v Speaker 2>happening right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll give you,</v>

2801
02:21:05.570 --> 02:21:05.580
<v Speaker 2>let you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is it?</v>

2802
02:21:05.880 --> 02:21:08.040
<v Speaker 2>Columbia just got fired by trump a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little bit.</v>

2803
02:21:08.070 --> 02:21:13.070
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a twitter is a about.</v>

2804
02:21:14.820 --> 02:21:17.940
<v Speaker 2>This is a little off topic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean,</v>

2805
02:21:18.420 --> 02:21:19.790
<v Speaker 2>you want to talk about a finger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2806
02:21:19.800 --> 02:21:21.410
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were talking about men.</v>

2807
02:21:21.900 --> 02:21:26.900
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're talking about men and what </v>

2808
02:21:26.900 --> 02:21:26.900
<v Speaker 2>motivates them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2809
02:21:26.900 --> 02:21:27.600
<v Speaker 2>And so then we were talking about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fact that,</v>

2810
02:21:28.260 --> 02:21:30.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I'm speaking publicly now,</v>

2811
02:21:30.300 --> 02:21:32.940
<v Speaker 2>most of my audience is men and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>their eyes light up when they're.</v>

2812
02:21:33.240 --> 02:21:38.240
<v Speaker 2>So we were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were talking about the necessity of </v>

2813
02:21:38.240 --> 02:21:39.030
<v Speaker 2>taking on the burden of a responsibility</v>
<v Speaker 2>because people,</v>

2814
02:21:39.240 --> 02:21:42.990
<v Speaker 2>not only are we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>should we be acting out the archetype of</v>

2815
02:21:42.991 --> 02:21:47.991
<v Speaker 2>the hero,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we should be carrying the weight </v>

2816
02:21:47.991 --> 02:21:49.200
<v Speaker 2>while we're doing it because we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're like pack animals.</v>

2817
02:21:49.530 --> 02:21:52.560
<v Speaker 2>We're not happy without a wait.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think it's.</v>

2818
02:21:52.680 --> 02:21:57.680
<v Speaker 2>I do think it's something like they have</v>
<v Speaker 2>to justify your miserable existence.</v>

2819
02:21:58.320 --> 02:22:00.420
<v Speaker 2>Do you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is my theory about that,</v>

2820
02:22:00.900 --> 02:22:05.730
<v Speaker 2>I believe that there are certain human </v>
<v Speaker 2>reward systems that we have ingrained in</v>

2821
02:22:05.731 --> 02:22:10.731
<v Speaker 2>us and that have allowed us to survive </v>
<v Speaker 2>this long and that these reward systems,</v>

2822
02:22:11.520 --> 02:22:16.520
<v Speaker 2>a lot of them entail overcoming struggle</v>
<v Speaker 2>because struggle was inexorable.</v>

2823
02:22:16.980 --> 02:22:21.300
<v Speaker 2>It was a massive part of existence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that without struggle,</v>

2824
02:22:21.630 --> 02:22:23.010
<v Speaker 2>our body is almost like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2825
02:22:23.011 --> 02:22:25.410
<v Speaker 2>how come we're not hug?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not overcoming something.</v>

2826
02:22:25.411 --> 02:22:25.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2827
02:22:25.620 --> 02:22:27.180
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's almost like a trick.</v>

2828
02:22:27.540 --> 02:22:32.540
<v Speaker 2>Like you have to trick your body and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>trick your brain and trick your </v>

2829
02:22:32.540 --> 02:22:32.540
<v Speaker 2>humanity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

2830
02:22:32.540 --> 02:22:37.230
<v Speaker 2>your very existence into having some </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of a purpose in order to be at a </v>

2831
02:22:37.230 --> 02:22:37.230
<v Speaker 2>baseline.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2832
02:22:37.230 --> 02:22:38.410
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to make sense.</v>

2833
02:22:39.120 --> 02:22:40.140
<v Speaker 2>It does make sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

2834
02:22:40.141 --> 02:22:41.580
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think.</v>

2835
02:22:41.730 --> 02:22:46.730
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's a trick here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's why I think that because I think </v>

2836
02:22:46.730 --> 02:22:48.900
<v Speaker 2>there is something irreducible about </v>
<v Speaker 2>suffering.</v>

2837
02:22:49.170 --> 02:22:49.920
<v Speaker 2>I think it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

2838
02:22:50.130 --> 02:22:50.760
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

2839
02:22:51.010 --> 02:22:54.540
<v Speaker 2>it speaks for itself as a reality and </v>
<v Speaker 2>unquestionable reality.</v>

2840
02:22:54.820 --> 02:22:59.820
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody says to a child that's in severe </v>

2841
02:22:59.820 --> 02:23:00.210
<v Speaker 2>pain and that it isn't going to matter </v>
<v Speaker 2>in a million years.</v>

2842
02:23:00.660 --> 02:23:03.150
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The pain trumps everything.</v>

2843
02:23:03.210 --> 02:23:08.210
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then it seems to me that attempts to </v>

2844
02:23:08.210 --> 02:23:10.170
<v Speaker 2>alleviate suffering trump everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you want to responsibility,</v>

2845
02:23:10.171 --> 02:23:11.040
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there you go.</v>

2846
02:23:11.080 --> 02:23:13.530
<v Speaker 2>One try,</v>
<v Speaker 2>argue your way out of that.</v>

2847
02:23:13.620 --> 02:23:14.970
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fine.</v>

2848
02:23:16.020 --> 02:23:18.750
<v Speaker 2>Your suffering doesn't matter then </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's for sure.</v>

2849
02:23:18.810 --> 02:23:20.400
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>none of this suffering matters.</v>

2850
02:23:20.670 --> 02:23:23.220
<v Speaker 2>You're going to go down that road are </v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2851
02:23:23.250 --> 02:23:28.250
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what the face of someone who </v>

2852
02:23:28.250 --> 02:23:29.790
<v Speaker 2>says that no suffering matter matters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Looks like it's not pleasant.</v>

2853
02:23:30.600 --> 02:23:34.740
<v Speaker 2>So there's no neutral position with </v>
<v Speaker 2>regards to that.</v>

2854
02:23:35.310 --> 02:23:37.920
<v Speaker 2>So you see the world is full of </v>
<v Speaker 2>unrequited suffering,</v>

2855
02:23:37.921 --> 02:23:42.921
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and who knows how much of it is </v>

2856
02:23:42.921 --> 02:23:44.661
<v Speaker 2>unnecessary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Certainly the stuff you create seems to </v>

2857
02:23:44.661 --> 02:23:47.751
<v Speaker 2>be unnecessary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially if he created purposefully </v>

2858
02:23:47.751 --> 02:23:48.210
<v Speaker 2>and people are doing that all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you need a burden,</v>

2859
02:23:48.211 --> 02:23:53.211
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how about how about dampening down the </v>

2860
02:23:53.211 --> 02:23:56.961
<v Speaker 2>unnecessary suffering a little bit about</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying hard to do that for the rest of </v>

2861
02:23:56.961 --> 02:23:57.960
<v Speaker 2>your life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See if that'll do it.</v>

2862
02:23:58.740 --> 02:24:02.540
<v Speaker 2>And God only knows how far you'd get you</v>
<v Speaker 2>might get along waste,</v>

2863
02:24:02.570 --> 02:24:02.900
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2864
02:24:03.530 --> 02:24:06.180
<v Speaker 2>When,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when people talk about meaning though,</v>

2865
02:24:06.240 --> 02:24:08.910
<v Speaker 2>when you talk about suffering and this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2866
02:24:08.911 --> 02:24:13.911
<v Speaker 2>this idea like what is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is going on in the mind that </v>

2867
02:24:14.161 --> 02:24:17.310
<v Speaker 2>desires this difficult pursuit?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what,</v>

2868
02:24:17.311 --> 02:24:22.311
<v Speaker 2>what is going on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like why is that a part of being a </v>

2869
02:24:22.311 --> 02:24:25.371
<v Speaker 2>person?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like why is it a part of your ultimate </v>

2870
02:24:25.371 --> 02:24:29.061
<v Speaker 2>happiness to have these obstacles to </v>
<v Speaker 2>overcome and these character developing </v>

2871
02:24:29.061 --> 02:24:30.390
<v Speaker 2>moments,</v>
<v Speaker 2>character,</v>

2872
02:24:30.391 --> 02:24:35.391
<v Speaker 2>building episodes in order for you to </v>
<v Speaker 2>manage life and to get through life with</v>

2873
02:24:36.001 --> 02:24:39.810
<v Speaker 2>the most amount of happiness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a story about this.</v>

2874
02:24:40.080 --> 02:24:43.170
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a frog and the Scorpion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know the story.</v>

2875
02:24:43.590 --> 02:24:44.310
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the frog,</v>

2876
02:24:44.311 --> 02:24:44.880
<v Speaker 2>please.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2877
02:24:44.881 --> 02:24:45.600
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the frog,</v>

2878
02:24:45.630 --> 02:24:50.630
<v Speaker 2>the Scorpion convinces the frog to give </v>
<v Speaker 2>him the right across the river and the </v>

2879
02:24:50.630 --> 02:24:50.910
<v Speaker 2>frog says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2880
02:24:50.911 --> 02:24:51.990
<v Speaker 2>you're a scorpion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

2881
02:24:52.100 --> 02:24:57.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to do that because you're </v>

2882
02:24:57.100 --> 02:24:57.100
<v Speaker 2>going to nail me with your tail.</v>

2883
02:24:57.100 --> 02:24:57.530
<v Speaker 2>And the Scorpion says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2884
02:24:57.531 --> 02:25:02.531
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I do that when we're in the river </v>

2885
02:25:02.531 --> 02:25:02.531
<v Speaker 2>will both drowned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So why would I do that?</v>

2886
02:25:02.531 --> 02:25:07.311
<v Speaker 2>So the frog agrees to ferry the Scorpion</v>
<v Speaker 2>across and they get halfway out and </v>

2887
02:25:07.311 --> 02:25:10.140
<v Speaker 2>Scorpion stings the frog says turns to </v>
<v Speaker 2>him with his dying breath and says,</v>

2888
02:25:10.141 --> 02:25:11.670
<v Speaker 2>why'd you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the Scorpion said,</v>

2889
02:25:11.671 --> 02:25:12.780
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's in my nature,</v>

2890
02:25:13.530 --> 02:25:16.260
<v Speaker 2>and that's the answer to your question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that it's in our nature.</v>

2891
02:25:16.470 --> 02:25:18.930
<v Speaker 2>That's what an archetype is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're the hero.</v>

2892
02:25:18.931 --> 02:25:21.370
<v Speaker 2>Archetype is the story of men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2893
02:25:21.410 --> 02:25:25.780
<v Speaker 2>But do you think that that nature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because that is how we survived,</v>

2894
02:25:25.810 --> 02:25:30.810
<v Speaker 2>how over the millions of years will </v>
<v Speaker 2>evolve from lower hominids to being a </v>

2895
02:25:30.810 --> 02:25:34.210
<v Speaker 2>human being,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that we needed to have the mechanisms</v>

2896
02:25:34.390 --> 02:25:39.390
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in our very existence to overcome </v>

2897
02:25:39.390 --> 02:25:39.390
<v Speaker 2>struggle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then all of a sudden,</v>

2898
02:25:39.390 --> 02:25:40.480
<v Speaker 2>Joel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe we chose it.</v>

2899
02:25:40.870 --> 02:25:41.890
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think,</v>

2900
02:25:41.920 --> 02:25:46.920
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think it is part of the </v>

2901
02:25:46.920 --> 02:25:46.920
<v Speaker 2>evolutionary process,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but look,</v>

2902
02:25:46.920 --> 02:25:51.210
<v Speaker 2>the thing about sexual selection or the </v>
<v Speaker 2>mechanisms that we talked about say </v>

2903
02:25:51.210 --> 02:25:53.590
<v Speaker 2>whereby the dominance hierarchy is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>selection mechanism for,</v>

2904
02:25:53.610 --> 02:25:55.270
<v Speaker 2>for the transfer of genetic material.</v>

2905
02:25:55.270 --> 02:26:00.270
<v Speaker 2>There's a choice in that if a group of </v>
<v Speaker 2>guys gets to get together and a leader </v>

2906
02:26:00.270 --> 02:26:00.270
<v Speaker 2>emerge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone,</v>

2907
02:26:00.270 --> 02:26:02.620
<v Speaker 2>everyone respects.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like an election.</v>

2908
02:26:02.740 --> 02:26:06.400
<v Speaker 2>Everyone voted on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We chose that particular type of person.</v>

2909
02:26:06.550 --> 02:26:07.690
<v Speaker 2>Well who is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2910
02:26:07.691 --> 02:26:12.691
<v Speaker 2>that's the heroic type.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Human beings have chosen that and then </v>

2911
02:26:12.691 --> 02:26:12.691
<v Speaker 2>the women think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh look,</v>

2912
02:26:12.691 --> 02:26:16.681
<v Speaker 2>I heroic type.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like they grabbed them before </v>

2913
02:26:16.681 --> 02:26:17.950
<v Speaker 2>someone else gets it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so that's been going on forever.</v>

2914
02:26:18.640 --> 02:26:20.200
<v Speaker 2>So did we choose it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2915
02:26:21.190 --> 02:26:23.980
<v Speaker 2>the action of our choice across </v>
<v Speaker 2>millennia selected it.</v>

2916
02:26:25.090 --> 02:26:26.920
<v Speaker 2>These are things evolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychologists,</v>

2917
02:26:26.921 --> 02:26:31.921
<v Speaker 2>biologists don't think about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't think about the role that </v>

2918
02:26:31.921 --> 02:26:35.371
<v Speaker 2>consciousness played in determining who </v>
<v Speaker 2>survived and how and why it's been going</v>

2919
02:26:35.471 --> 02:26:40.471
<v Speaker 2>on for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>While they certainly know about sexual </v>

2920
02:26:40.471 --> 02:26:41.120
<v Speaker 2>selection by female choice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2921
02:26:41.200 --> 02:26:44.110
<v Speaker 2>but the full implications of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>haven't been thought through.</v>

2922
02:26:44.940 --> 02:26:48.730
<v Speaker 2>Like I've just really started to grapple</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the idea that the male hierarchy is</v>

2923
02:26:48.820 --> 02:26:50.140
<v Speaker 2>sexual selection device.</v>

2924
02:26:51.400 --> 02:26:52.990
<v Speaker 2>It's like the men are voting on well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>

2925
02:26:53.260 --> 02:26:55.210
<v Speaker 2>which of us deserves to go sleep with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>woman.</v>

2926
02:26:55.300 --> 02:26:56.170
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well you don't,</v>

2927
02:26:56.171 --> 02:26:58.170
<v Speaker 2>you're kind of a weaselly little snake,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you know,</v>

2928
02:26:58.240 --> 02:26:59.050
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not you.</v>

2929
02:26:59.051 --> 02:26:59.560
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2930
02:26:59.561 --> 02:27:01.330
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe looks like quite the guy.</v>

2931
02:27:01.570 --> 02:27:03.370
<v Speaker 2>Let's put him at the top of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hierarchy.</v>

2932
02:27:04.810 --> 02:27:07.060
<v Speaker 2>That's what men have been doing with </v>
<v Speaker 2>each other forever.</v>

2933
02:27:08.440 --> 02:27:12.250
<v Speaker 2>Isn't there more to it than that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot to that because of.</v>

2934
02:27:12.251 --> 02:27:14.500
<v Speaker 2>The question is who is it that they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>electing,</v>

2935
02:27:14.620 --> 02:27:16.870
<v Speaker 2>but is it really just about sexual </v>
<v Speaker 2>selection?</v>

2936
02:27:18.650 --> 02:27:20.290
<v Speaker 2>That's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe.</v>

2937
02:27:20.530 --> 02:27:25.530
<v Speaker 2>Freud thought so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's half about that get say half.</v>

2938
02:27:26.740 --> 02:27:27.510
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2939
02:27:27.520 --> 02:27:30.700
<v Speaker 2>there's the survival of the individual </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the survival of the species.</v>

2940
02:27:31.630 --> 02:27:35.260
<v Speaker 2>So those are the two things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in the.</v>

2941
02:27:35.290 --> 02:27:39.040
<v Speaker 2>But even with that sexual selection,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even with that,</v>

2942
02:27:40.270 --> 02:27:45.270
<v Speaker 2>say if a person does rise to the top of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the social hierarchy in that small </v>

2943
02:27:45.520 --> 02:27:49.480
<v Speaker 2>Dunbar's number of 250 people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the person,</v>

2944
02:27:49.481 --> 02:27:50.170
<v Speaker 2>is that enough?</v>

2945
02:27:50.200 --> 02:27:55.200
<v Speaker 2>Does that person still need purpose?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do they still need something in some </v>

2946
02:27:55.200 --> 02:27:56.160
<v Speaker 2>difficult struggle for them to feel </v>
<v Speaker 2>fulfilled?</v>

2947
02:27:56.161 --> 02:27:57.880
<v Speaker 2>For most of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for most of human history,</v>

2948
02:27:57.881 --> 02:28:01.590
<v Speaker 2>that just wasn't a problem because you </v>
<v Speaker 2>had struggle constantly,</v>

2949
02:28:01.750 --> 02:28:02.590
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

2950
02:28:02.591 --> 02:28:07.591
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Any problem today that is that the </v>

2951
02:28:07.591 --> 02:28:07.591
<v Speaker 2>problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our lack of problems?</v>

2952
02:28:07.591 --> 02:28:11.730
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's something kierkegaard pointed out </v>

2953
02:28:11.730 --> 02:28:13.740
<v Speaker 2>like 150 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said they'll come a time when </v>

2954
02:28:13.740 --> 02:28:14.670
<v Speaker 2>everything has been done so well for </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone that the only lack,</v>

2955
02:28:15.220 --> 02:28:18.010
<v Speaker 2>the only felt lack will be for lack </v>
<v Speaker 2>itself.</v>

2956
02:28:18.250 --> 02:28:22.070
<v Speaker 2>Are you concerned because of that and </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you're acutely aware of this</v>

2957
02:28:22.070 --> 02:28:27.070
<v Speaker 1>issue or concern with this potential </v>
<v Speaker 1>future that we have in front of us with </v>

2958
02:28:27.070 --> 02:28:30.940
<v Speaker 1>artificial intelligence and virtual </v>
<v Speaker 1>reality in this need to live in a world </v>

2959
02:28:30.940 --> 02:28:35.231
<v Speaker 1>that's not real like I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many kids today listening to this </v>

2960
02:28:35.231 --> 02:28:38.330
<v Speaker 1>exist for a massive amount of their day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>watching video games,</v>

2961
02:28:38.331 --> 02:28:40.660
<v Speaker 1>playing video games,</v>
<v Speaker 1>playing the archetypal hero,</v>

2962
02:28:40.690 --> 02:28:45.590
<v Speaker 1>and I had a friend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is a classic story.</v>

2963
02:28:45.591 --> 02:28:47.630
<v Speaker 1>I'll never forget this statement that he</v>
<v Speaker 1>said to me.</v>

2964
02:28:47.631 --> 02:28:50.720
<v Speaker 1>He was one of the managers at the comedy</v>
<v Speaker 1>store who's a very nice guy,</v>

2965
02:28:50.721 --> 02:28:54.320
<v Speaker 1>but he was addicted to video games,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I have been in the past.</v>

2966
02:28:54.680 --> 02:28:56.580
<v Speaker 1>I was addicted to video games for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>couple of years,</v>

2967
02:28:57.320 --> 02:28:58.700
<v Speaker 1>might play them all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I loved them.</v>

2968
02:28:58.701 --> 02:29:01.250
<v Speaker 1>There was so much fun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this guy,</v>

2969
02:29:01.520 --> 02:29:02.930
<v Speaker 1>he had it bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was.</v>

2970
02:29:02.931 --> 02:29:06.290
<v Speaker 1>I had a career while I was doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I managed to figure it out that this was</v>

2971
02:29:06.291 --> 02:29:08.060
<v Speaker 1>a massive waste of my time and get </v>
<v Speaker 1>through.</v>

2972
02:29:08.270 --> 02:29:13.270
<v Speaker 1>He didn't and when one day he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean Pale,</v>

2973
02:29:15.081 --> 02:29:20.081
<v Speaker 1>like he hadn't been outside days and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>was hanging out in the back of the </v>

2974
02:29:20.081 --> 02:29:22.040
<v Speaker 1>comedy store and we were talking and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>was addicted to,</v>

2975
02:29:22.041 --> 02:29:27.041
<v Speaker 1>I think it was ever quest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was this crazy roleplaying game </v>

2976
02:29:27.041 --> 02:29:31.061
<v Speaker 1>that you just do and you just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People would play it 18 hours a day and </v>

2977
02:29:31.061 --> 02:29:32.360
<v Speaker 1>he said something I'll never forget.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

2978
02:29:32.900 --> 02:29:37.900
<v Speaker 1>I'm so successful in the video game </v>
<v Speaker 1>world and so unsuccessful in the real </v>

2979
02:29:38.721 --> 02:29:43.721
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was like sitting there like </v>

2980
02:29:43.721 --> 02:29:43.721
<v Speaker 1>shaking his head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

2981
02:29:43.721 --> 02:29:45.650
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the real world.</v>

2982
02:29:46.040 --> 02:29:49.490
<v Speaker 1>He was like very unfulfilled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Couldn't find a girlfriend,</v>

2983
02:29:49.740 --> 02:29:53.270
<v Speaker 1>was struggling financially in the video </v>
<v Speaker 1>game world.</v>

2984
02:29:53.450 --> 02:29:58.450
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some warlock is out there slaying </v>

2985
02:29:58.450 --> 02:30:01.121
<v Speaker 1>dragons and in and he found great reward</v>
<v Speaker 1>in that video game world.</v>

2986
02:30:02.340 --> 02:30:07.130
<v Speaker 1>I am very concerned that we will </v>
<v Speaker 1>literally almost be like in the matrix,</v>

2987
02:30:07.131 --> 02:30:10.880
<v Speaker 1>plugged into some artificial electronic </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

2988
02:30:11.060 --> 02:30:16.060
<v Speaker 1>which I think these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these video games that people are </v>

2989
02:30:16.060 --> 02:30:16.060
<v Speaker 1>playing all day long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're a precursor to that.</v>

2990
02:30:16.060 --> 02:30:17.990
<v Speaker 1>Don't get me along if you have great </v>
<v Speaker 1>self control.</v>

2991
02:30:17.991 --> 02:30:19.460
<v Speaker 1>They're very enjoyable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're fun,</v>

2992
02:30:19.640 --> 02:30:21.920
<v Speaker 1>they're great social time with you and </v>
<v Speaker 1>your friends get together,</v>

2993
02:30:21.921 --> 02:30:26.921
<v Speaker 1>you play and you have a great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As long as you're actually being </v>

2994
02:30:26.921 --> 02:30:26.921
<v Speaker 1>productive and active in our everyday </v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

2995
02:30:26.960 --> 02:30:28.280
<v Speaker 1>I don't really think there are a </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem,</v>

2996
02:30:28.490 --> 02:30:33.490
<v Speaker 1>but my concern is that they are a </v>
<v Speaker 1>precursor and that we are seeing the </v>

2997
02:30:33.490 --> 02:30:35.210
<v Speaker 1>beginning steps to this artificial world</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

2998
02:30:35.211 --> 02:30:38.420
<v Speaker 1>that we will be embedded in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the very near future.</v>

2999
02:30:39.380 --> 02:30:40.070
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3000
02:30:40.150 --> 02:30:45.150
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we decided already that we're in a </v>

3001
02:30:45.150 --> 02:30:47.090
<v Speaker 1>period of chaos and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of the reason I'm loath to make any</v>

3002
02:30:47.091 --> 02:30:49.370
<v Speaker 1>predictions is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's one of the reasons.</v>

3003
02:30:49.400 --> 02:30:52.790
<v Speaker 1>It's like how many things need to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>going sideways at the same time.</v>

3004
02:30:53.150 --> 02:30:55.380
<v Speaker 1>Lots of things are going sideways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3005
02:30:55.470 --> 02:30:57.470
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea what's going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3006
02:30:57.471 --> 02:30:59.750
<v Speaker 1>we're building autonomous cars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seventy,</v>

3007
02:30:59.900 --> 02:31:04.520
<v Speaker 1>like that's the biggest employment </v>
<v Speaker 1>category driver.</v>

3008
02:31:04.610 --> 02:31:07.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what then you know,</v>

3009
02:31:08.150 --> 02:31:09.590
<v Speaker 1>but why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why worry about that?</v>

3010
02:31:09.591 --> 02:31:11.060
<v Speaker 1>There's 20 other things that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening.</v>

3011
02:31:11.061 --> 02:31:13.970
<v Speaker 1>They're just as revolutionary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what's going to happen?</v>

3012
02:31:15.320 --> 02:31:17.150
<v Speaker 1>Who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea.</v>

3013
02:31:17.780 --> 02:31:20.310
<v Speaker 1>I think maybe I know how to steer the </v>
<v Speaker 1>boat.</v>

3014
02:31:20.910 --> 02:31:25.910
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's all he tried to tell the truth </v>

3015
02:31:25.910 --> 02:31:29.240
<v Speaker 2>and maybe you'll get through it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>acted out as well because what else do </v>

3016
02:31:29.240 --> 02:31:32.490
<v Speaker 2>you have is not another fantastic sign </v>
<v Speaker 2>of chaos.</v>

3017
02:31:33.050 --> 02:31:34.800
<v Speaker 2>I say fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not in a positive way,</v>

3018
02:31:35.370 --> 02:31:38.040
<v Speaker 2>but that Donald Trump is our president.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>

3019
02:31:38.130 --> 02:31:43.130
<v Speaker 2>The president has who has had the </v>
<v Speaker 2>biggest problem with the truth that </v>

3020
02:31:43.130 --> 02:31:45.450
<v Speaker 2>we've ever experienced.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've never experienced a president like</v>

3021
02:31:45.451 --> 02:31:49.380
<v Speaker 2>this where we know that he has a problem</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the truth and it's,</v>

3022
02:31:49.410 --> 02:31:50.910
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's open,</v>

3023
02:31:51.280 --> 02:31:52.060
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

3024
02:31:52.110 --> 02:31:57.110
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't seem to funnies us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He has an unstructured problem with the </v>

3025
02:31:57.110 --> 02:32:00.711
<v Speaker 2>truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was preferred as a candidate to </v>

3026
02:32:00.711 --> 02:32:02.040
<v Speaker 2>someone who had a structured approach to</v>
<v Speaker 2>untruth.</v>

3027
02:32:02.110 --> 02:32:03.120
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3028
02:32:03.121 --> 02:32:05.070
<v Speaker 2>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pick your type of lie.</v>

3029
02:32:05.430 --> 02:32:10.310
<v Speaker 2>You can pick the ideal ideology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>power aiming lie or a new kind of or or.</v>

3030
02:32:10.380 --> 02:32:12.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a more personal lie.</v>

3031
02:32:12.210 --> 02:32:14.330
<v Speaker 2>Say if you're going to be cynical about </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

3032
02:32:14.380 --> 02:32:19.380
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it kind of lie to that didn't fit the </v>

3033
02:32:19.380 --> 02:32:20.910
<v Speaker 2>standard structure that we're accustomed</v>
<v Speaker 2>to and felt very disenchanted with.</v>

3034
02:32:22.620 --> 02:32:25.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lower maybe a nakedly self-serving lie.</v>

3035
02:32:25.381 --> 02:32:25.860
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

3036
02:32:25.861 --> 02:32:30.861
<v Speaker 2>thank God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's such a relief after the </v>

3037
02:32:30.861 --> 02:32:30.861
<v Speaker 2>totalitarian ideology lies.</v>

3038
02:32:32.800 --> 02:32:35.760
<v Speaker 2>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when he said that way so fucked up.</v>

3039
02:32:37.250 --> 02:32:39.210
<v Speaker 2>That's obviously it though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3040
02:32:39.211 --> 02:32:41.040
<v Speaker 2>well that's definitely part of it and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>mean,</v>

3041
02:32:41.041 --> 02:32:46.041
<v Speaker 2>lots of people did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know people went into the voting </v>

3042
02:32:46.041 --> 02:32:46.041
<v Speaker 2>booth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their hand was hovering over Hillary,</v>

3043
02:32:46.041 --> 02:32:46.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was shaking and they thought,</v>

3044
02:32:46.861 --> 02:32:47.670
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to hell with it,</v>

3045
02:32:47.880 --> 02:32:49.920
<v Speaker 2>trump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

3046
02:32:50.250 --> 02:32:55.250
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the sentiment that I can </v>

3047
02:32:55.250 --> 02:32:55.250
<v Speaker 2>appreciate?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So and so here we are,</v>

3048
02:32:55.440 --> 02:32:58.950
<v Speaker 2>but that's only the tiny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's only the tail end of the Dragon.</v>

3049
02:32:58.980 --> 02:32:59.970
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3050
02:33:00.150 --> 02:33:02.490
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who knows,</v>

3051
02:33:02.491 --> 02:33:05.910
<v Speaker 2>who can look ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a strange time we're in.</v>

3052
02:33:05.970 --> 02:33:09.360
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's associated with Kurt swells,</v>
<v Speaker 2>prognostications,</v>

3053
02:33:09.361 --> 02:33:10.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he,</v>

3054
02:33:10.610 --> 02:33:15.610
<v Speaker 2>he talked about the consequences of an </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever accelerating technological </v>

3055
02:33:15.610 --> 02:33:18.480
<v Speaker 2>transformation and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean look,</v>

3056
02:33:18.481 --> 02:33:21.390
<v Speaker 2>just in the last 50 years we've had the </v>
<v Speaker 2>birth control,</v>

3057
02:33:21.391 --> 02:33:24.950
<v Speaker 2>the hydrogen bomb and the transistor </v>
<v Speaker 2>thrown out as it's like,</v>

3058
02:33:24.960 --> 02:33:27.470
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those are some pretty wild tornadoes.</v>

3059
02:33:27.920 --> 02:33:28.610
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

3060
02:33:28.830 --> 02:33:33.830
<v Speaker 2>and that's just scratching the surface.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the last 100.</v>

3061
02:33:34.980 --> 02:33:39.980
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you just go back to the beginning of </v>

3062
02:33:39.980 --> 02:33:39.980
<v Speaker 2>the 20th century to today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3063
02:33:39.980 --> 02:33:41.100
<v Speaker 2>it's fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's unbelievable.</v>

3064
02:33:41.130 --> 02:33:41.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3065
02:33:41.401 --> 02:33:42.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in 18,</v>

3066
02:33:42.121 --> 02:33:47.121
<v Speaker 2>95,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the average person in the west lived on </v>

3067
02:33:47.121 --> 02:33:48.210
<v Speaker 2>a dollar a day in today's dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In 18.</v>

3068
02:33:48.211 --> 02:33:49.170
<v Speaker 2>90 five.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

3069
02:33:49.171 --> 02:33:50.970
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>In today's dollars.</v>

3070
02:33:51.160 --> 02:33:51.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3071
02:33:51.870 --> 02:33:52.770
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3072
02:33:52.771 --> 02:33:54.150
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No kidding.</v>

3073
02:33:55.080 --> 02:33:56.010
<v Speaker 2>No kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3074
02:33:56.011 --> 02:34:01.011
<v Speaker 2>that's the other thing with the people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they find out how little the rest </v>

3075
02:34:01.011 --> 02:34:03.921
<v Speaker 2>of the world lives on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they find out that the top one percent </v>

3076
02:34:03.921 --> 02:34:05.160
<v Speaker 2>of the world makes about $34,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>us.</v>

3077
02:34:05.310 --> 02:34:05.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3078
02:34:05.731 --> 02:34:07.890
<v Speaker 2>it depends on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know if you're,</v>

3079
02:34:08.210 --> 02:34:09.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for many people,</v>

3080
02:34:09.421 --> 02:34:11.910
<v Speaker 2>someone who's rich is someone who has </v>
<v Speaker 2>more money than them.</v>

3081
02:34:12.200 --> 02:34:14.310
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which is one of the things I really find</v>

3082
02:34:14.311 --> 02:34:17.010
<v Speaker 2>funny about the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the radical left protests.</v>

3083
02:34:17.140 --> 02:34:18.040
<v Speaker 2>The campus is like</v>

3084
02:34:18.220 --> 02:34:19.720
<v Speaker 1>down with the one percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

3085
02:34:19.721 --> 02:34:20.890
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sunshine,</v>

3086
02:34:21.250 --> 02:34:22.860
<v Speaker 1>you're part of the one percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're just,</v>

3087
02:34:22.990 --> 02:34:26.410
<v Speaker 1>you're actually a baby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One 10th of one percent or or maybe one,</v>

3088
02:34:26.411 --> 02:34:29.950
<v Speaker 1>100th of one percent or you're just </v>
<v Speaker 1>angry because you're not there yet,</v>

3089
02:34:30.430 --> 02:34:35.430
<v Speaker 1>but you will be when you're 40 and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know it and so does everybody else and </v>

3090
02:34:35.430 --> 02:34:38.911
<v Speaker 1>now instead of regarding yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>properly as a fledgling member of the </v>

3091
02:34:39.251 --> 02:34:41.080
<v Speaker 1>elite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to have it both ways.</v>

3092
02:34:41.290 --> 02:34:46.290
<v Speaker 1>You want to be fledgling member of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>elite and champion of the Undergrad </v>

3093
02:34:46.290 --> 02:34:49.270
<v Speaker 1>under privileged,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so how narcissistic can you get?</v>

3094
02:34:50.050 --> 02:34:55.050
<v Speaker 1>You want to have all the benefits of </v>
<v Speaker 1>having all the benefits and you want to </v>

3095
02:34:55.050 --> 02:34:57.751
<v Speaker 1>have all the benefits of having none of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the benefits because just all the </v>

3096
02:34:57.751 --> 02:35:01.021
<v Speaker 1>benefits isn't enough for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One thing that it's a reoccurring </v>

3097
02:35:01.021 --> 02:35:04.561
<v Speaker 1>subjects that I find incredibly </v>
<v Speaker 1>fascinating and it keeps coming up and </v>

3098
02:35:04.561 --> 02:35:09.480
<v Speaker 1>it's been brought up even more so lately</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of artificial intelligence and </v>

3099
02:35:09.480 --> 02:35:11.980
<v Speaker 1>automated vehicles and all these </v>
<v Speaker 1>different things that are happening that</v>

3100
02:35:12.000 --> 02:35:17.000
<v Speaker 1>they're going to be an erosion of jobs </v>
<v Speaker 1>and a subject keeps reoccurring and </v>

3101
02:35:17.000 --> 02:35:20.650
<v Speaker 1>that's universal basic income.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea of giving people,</v>

3102
02:35:21.070 --> 02:35:23.560
<v Speaker 1>giving everyone a certain amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>money,</v>

3103
02:35:23.830 --> 02:35:26.500
<v Speaker 1>whether it's 12,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>or $18,000,</v>

3104
02:35:26.770 --> 02:35:28.000
<v Speaker 1>what do you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are your thoughts on that?</v>

3105
02:35:30.280 --> 02:35:32.910
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what to think about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3106
02:35:33.430 --> 02:35:38.430
<v Speaker 1>it certainly it would require a </v>
<v Speaker 1>revolution in the way people consider </v>

3107
02:35:38.430 --> 02:35:42.640
<v Speaker 1>their lives and then maybe that rev w,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do people do with leisure time?</v>

3108
02:35:43.840 --> 02:35:45.400
<v Speaker 1>What should you do with it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3109
02:35:45.610 --> 02:35:48.460
<v Speaker 1>leisure time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like what is leisure time exactly?</v>

3110
02:35:48.520 --> 02:35:51.320
<v Speaker 1>Is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it sitting in a closet like discord,</v>

3111
02:35:51.430 --> 02:35:56.430
<v Speaker 1>discarded android?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's often how people respond </v>

3112
02:35:56.430 --> 02:35:56.430
<v Speaker 1>when they retire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

3113
02:35:56.430 --> 02:36:01.381
<v Speaker 1>but what they have to retire or would </v>
<v Speaker 1>they have their needs taken care of as </v>

3114
02:36:01.381 --> 02:36:05.281
<v Speaker 1>far as food and shelter and then be able</v>
<v Speaker 1>to pursue something that they actually </v>

3115
02:36:05.281 --> 02:36:08.641
<v Speaker 1>enjoy and are interested in because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>job that they were stuck in doesn't </v>

3116
02:36:08.641 --> 02:36:12.061
<v Speaker 1>exist anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the question and I would say I </v>

3117
02:36:12.061 --> 02:36:12.760
<v Speaker 1>would say at the moment the data aren't </v>
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>

3118
02:36:13.270 --> 02:36:16.090
<v Speaker 1>You know what happens to a lot of men </v>
<v Speaker 1>who are unemployed now,</v>

3119
02:36:16.420 --> 02:36:20.140
<v Speaker 1>they've let say they've had that thrust </v>
<v Speaker 1>upon them involuntarily,</v>

3120
02:36:20.170 --> 02:36:24.820
<v Speaker 1>but most people who we would be talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about would be in that situation is that</v>

3121
02:36:25.070 --> 02:36:27.550
<v Speaker 1>they get depressed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they sit on the couch,</v>

3122
02:36:27.790 --> 02:36:29.530
<v Speaker 1>they develop chronic pain problems.</v>

3123
02:36:29.620 --> 02:36:34.620
<v Speaker 1>They start taking it will be it for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>pain problems and then soon they're </v>

3124
02:36:34.630 --> 02:36:36.610
<v Speaker 1>hooked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's not a pretty.</v>

3125
02:36:36.611 --> 02:36:38.890
<v Speaker 1>I mean I know that that everyone isn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing that,</v>

3126
02:36:38.891 --> 02:36:41.630
<v Speaker 1>but lots of people are doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's.</v>

3127
02:36:41.680 --> 02:36:44.640
<v Speaker 1>Unemployment is as an in kind of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>different thing because you know,</v>

3128
02:36:45.250 --> 02:36:50.250
<v Speaker 1>well my thought is that unemployment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you've got something like universal </v>

3129
02:36:50.250 --> 02:36:50.300
<v Speaker 1>basic income,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm born,</v>

3130
02:36:50.410 --> 02:36:55.410
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about a complete </v>
<v Speaker 1>revolution in the way society is </v>

3131
02:36:55.410 --> 02:36:55.410
<v Speaker 1>structured,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3132
02:36:55.410 --> 02:37:00.030
<v Speaker 1>Because if automation does come along </v>
<v Speaker 1>and artificial intelligence does come </v>

3133
02:37:00.030 --> 02:37:04.081
<v Speaker 1>along and it really is a situation where</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of the things that people do to </v>

3134
02:37:04.081 --> 02:37:05.560
<v Speaker 1>occupy their time in order to feed </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves and shelter themselves,</v>

3135
02:37:05.590 --> 02:37:07.870
<v Speaker 1>they don't exist anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's unnecessary.</v>

3136
02:37:08.080 --> 02:37:10.060
<v Speaker 1>So you're not talking about unemployment</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Bob,</v>

3137
02:37:10.210 --> 02:37:12.670
<v Speaker 1>you're not a good enough lawyer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've been fired.</v>

3138
02:37:12.880 --> 02:37:13.840
<v Speaker 1>And now you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

3139
02:37:13.841 --> 02:37:15.280
<v Speaker 1>I'm a failure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm depressed,</v>

3140
02:37:15.290 --> 02:37:16.340
<v Speaker 1>I am unemployed.</v>

3141
02:37:16.490 --> 02:37:20.930
<v Speaker 2>We're not talking about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're talking about literally society as</v>

3142
02:37:20.931 --> 02:37:23.240
<v Speaker 2>we know it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Having a complete reset.</v>

3143
02:37:23.300 --> 02:37:24.470
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3144
02:37:24.471 --> 02:37:26.930
<v Speaker 2>Well I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea what to say about that.</v>

3145
02:37:27.090 --> 02:37:29.640
<v Speaker 2>I don't either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why I asked you to look.</v>

3146
02:37:29.690 --> 02:37:30.770
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are people.</v>

3147
02:37:31.730 --> 02:37:36.680
<v Speaker 2>Here's the optimistic end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll speak as a determinist.</v>

3148
02:37:36.681 --> 02:37:39.100
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a determinist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm going to speak that way anyways.</v>

3149
02:37:39.101 --> 02:37:41.960
<v Speaker 2>So there are lots of people who are </v>
<v Speaker 2>creative.</v>

3150
02:37:42.230 --> 02:37:44.750
<v Speaker 2>They're high in trade,</v>
<v Speaker 2>openness from the big five perspective,</v>

3151
02:37:45.350 --> 02:37:50.350
<v Speaker 2>they're going to go do creative things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there are lots of people who aren't </v>

3152
02:37:50.350 --> 02:37:51.530
<v Speaker 2>creative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I don't know what they're going to do</v>

3153
02:37:51.531 --> 02:37:53.390
<v Speaker 2>because it isn't going to be creative </v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

3154
02:37:53.420 --> 02:37:54.760
<v Speaker 2>What do you think people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3155
02:37:54.761 --> 02:37:59.000
<v Speaker 2>why are people creative and noncreative?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like are there people that are just.</v>

3156
02:37:59.580 --> 02:38:04.580
<v Speaker 2>Not that it's never been nurtured in </v>
<v Speaker 2>them that they have the potential to be </v>

3157
02:38:04.580 --> 02:38:04.580
<v Speaker 2>creative or do you?</v>

3158
02:38:04.580 --> 02:38:05.480
<v Speaker 2>Don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3159
02:38:05.710 --> 02:38:10.710
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That the literature is pretty clear on </v>

3160
02:38:10.710 --> 02:38:10.710
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3161
02:38:10.710 --> 02:38:11.090
<v Speaker 2>the traits are highly heritable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're modifiable,</v>

3162
02:38:11.091 --> 02:38:16.091
<v Speaker 2>but if you're really non creative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like it ain't going anywhere for </v>

3163
02:38:16.091 --> 02:38:19.391
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the reason for that is creativity </v>

3164
02:38:19.391 --> 02:38:19.730
<v Speaker 2>isn't like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not all sweetness and light,</v>

3165
02:38:19.760 --> 02:38:22.130
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the reason there are non creative</v>

3166
02:38:22.131 --> 02:38:24.290
<v Speaker 2>people because creative people often </v>
<v Speaker 2>died.</v>

3167
02:38:25.100 --> 02:38:28.580
<v Speaker 2>They're all doing like screwy things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They attract attention from people.</v>

3168
02:38:28.581 --> 02:38:31.640
<v Speaker 2>They shouldn't attract attention from </v>
<v Speaker 2>the authorities.</v>

3169
02:38:32.390 --> 02:38:34.670
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>creative people are revolutionary.</v>

3170
02:38:35.060 --> 02:38:40.060
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if tyrants don't really like </v>

3171
02:38:40.060 --> 02:38:41.651
<v Speaker 2>revolutionaries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's lots of reasons not to be </v>

3172
02:38:41.651 --> 02:38:41.651
<v Speaker 2>creative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even now,</v>

3173
02:38:41.651 --> 02:38:45.581
<v Speaker 2>like creative people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to monetize your creative </v>

3174
02:38:45.581 --> 02:38:45.770
<v Speaker 2>creativity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Artists have a hell of a time surviving,</v>

3175
02:38:46.520 --> 02:38:46.990
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

3176
02:38:47.560 --> 02:38:51.860
<v Speaker 2>and so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so creativity has such as a.</v>

3177
02:38:52.180 --> 02:38:57.180
<v Speaker 2>it's a double edged blessing for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And part of the reason that lots of </v>

3178
02:38:57.180 --> 02:38:57.590
<v Speaker 2>people aren't creative is because it's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot.</v>

3179
02:38:58.340 --> 02:39:01.460
<v Speaker 2>Let's think about it from an </v>
<v Speaker 2>evolutionary perspective is because it's</v>

3180
02:39:01.461 --> 02:39:06.461
<v Speaker 2>a hell of a lot easier not to be decked </v>
<v Speaker 2>out in bright colors when the predators </v>

3181
02:39:06.461 --> 02:39:07.010
<v Speaker 2>come along,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3182
02:39:07.011 --> 02:39:08.960
<v Speaker 2>You want to stay camouflaged against the</v>
<v Speaker 2>herd,</v>

3183
02:39:08.961 --> 02:39:11.180
<v Speaker 2>like a zebra.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to stand out.</v>

3184
02:39:11.600 --> 02:39:16.600
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you a little story about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think I got this from Robert </v>

3185
02:39:16.600 --> 02:39:17.330
<v Speaker 2>Sapolsky and if I didn't I apologize,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>

3186
02:39:17.810 --> 02:39:20.600
<v Speaker 2>So let's say you're a biologist to go to</v>
<v Speaker 2>study some zebras,</v>

3187
02:39:21.170 --> 02:39:22.280
<v Speaker 2>you think people think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

3188
02:39:22.281 --> 02:39:25.010
<v Speaker 2>those zebras are camouflage because they</v>
<v Speaker 2>have black and white stripes.</v>

3189
02:39:25.160 --> 02:39:27.110
<v Speaker 2>Well no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not camouflage.</v>

3190
02:39:27.111 --> 02:39:29.360
<v Speaker 2>Lion is camouflaged.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's golden.</v>

3191
02:39:29.361 --> 02:39:32.990
<v Speaker 2>It looks like the grass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can see a zebra like 15 miles away.</v>

3192
02:39:32.991 --> 02:39:34.940
<v Speaker 2>It's black and white.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

3193
02:39:34.941 --> 02:39:36.680
<v Speaker 2>so you're looking at some zebras and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>

3194
02:39:36.730 --> 02:39:41.730
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need to look at one zebra to figure </v>

3195
02:39:41.730 --> 02:39:41.730
<v Speaker 2>out what it's doing because I'm trying </v>
<v Speaker 2>to understand zebras.</v>

3196
02:39:41.730 --> 02:39:43.340
<v Speaker 2>So you look at a zebra and then you take</v>
<v Speaker 2>some notes and look up and you think,</v>

3197
02:39:43.341 --> 02:39:44.900
<v Speaker 2>oh God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which zebra was that?</v>

3198
02:39:45.260 --> 02:39:47.240
<v Speaker 2>Because the camouflage is against the </v>
<v Speaker 2>herd.</v>

3199
02:39:48.080 --> 02:39:50.870
<v Speaker 2>Just the idea that the camouflage is </v>
<v Speaker 2>against the herd.</v>

3200
02:39:50.871 --> 02:39:53.750
<v Speaker 2>That's such a useful idea to have in </v>
<v Speaker 2>your mind.</v>

3201
02:39:53.780 --> 02:39:58.780
<v Speaker 2>That camouflage is against the herd.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you go up to the zebra in your jeep </v>

3202
02:39:58.780 --> 02:40:02.741
<v Speaker 2>and you've got to stick with a rag on it</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you put a nice daub of red paint on </v>

3203
02:40:02.741 --> 02:40:05.450
<v Speaker 2>the zebras haunch or you clip.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems like with a cattle clip and the</v>

3204
02:40:05.451 --> 02:40:07.790
<v Speaker 2>first thing that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get it the hell out of there and the</v>

3205
02:40:07.791 --> 02:40:12.791
<v Speaker 2>lions kill it because they can identify </v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing that stands out and organize </v>

3206
02:40:13.200 --> 02:40:14.010
<v Speaker 2>their hunter around it.</v>

3207
02:40:14.370 --> 02:40:16.260
<v Speaker 1>And so that's why there aren't creative </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

3208
02:40:16.850 --> 02:40:19.560
<v Speaker 1>I think that is a Paul scan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was a rear clip.</v>

3209
02:40:19.650 --> 02:40:21.390
<v Speaker 1>I remember.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember this discussion.</v>

3210
02:40:21.670 --> 02:40:26.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That it's also that the edge detection </v>

3211
02:40:26.710 --> 02:40:27.540
<v Speaker 1>animal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's a,</v>

3212
02:40:27.560 --> 02:40:32.560
<v Speaker 1>there's a type of or pattern account </v>
<v Speaker 1>flash pattern called the asap and asap </v>

3213
02:40:33.090 --> 02:40:36.750
<v Speaker 1>camouflage doesn't look like trees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3214
02:40:36.751 --> 02:40:41.751
<v Speaker 1>when people think of pull up asap </v>
<v Speaker 1>pattern first light l I t,</v>

3215
02:40:43.480 --> 02:40:47.040
<v Speaker 1>m military camouflage pattern all </v>
<v Speaker 1>season,</v>

3216
02:40:47.041 --> 02:40:50.040
<v Speaker 1>all terrain can necessarily develop </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

3217
02:40:50.060 --> 02:40:51.480
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just stole it.</v>

3218
02:40:51.540 --> 02:40:52.630
<v Speaker 1>Congratulations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

3219
02:40:52.650 --> 02:40:54.300
<v Speaker 1>It's one of our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like we're all one.</v>

3220
02:40:54.510 --> 02:40:56.160
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe in borders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3221
02:40:56.170 --> 02:41:01.170
<v Speaker 1>it's actually for animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There you could see a psat and the </v>

3222
02:41:01.170 --> 02:41:04.161
<v Speaker 1>reason is animals can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They they only see in black and white,</v>

3223
02:41:04.291 --> 02:41:09.291
<v Speaker 1>like Predator prey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Animals like deer and it's edge </v>

3224
02:41:09.291 --> 02:41:11.640
<v Speaker 1>detection that they're looking for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And these things,</v>

3225
02:41:11.641 --> 02:41:13.260
<v Speaker 1>the hard lines of the black.</v>

3226
02:41:13.260 --> 02:41:16.280
<v Speaker 1>And the Brown and the lighter colors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it throws off the.</v>

3227
02:41:16.410 --> 02:41:18.270
<v Speaker 1>That's fusion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a different color.</v>

3228
02:41:19.470 --> 02:41:24.470
<v Speaker 1>That's a different type of camera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the asap is what we're talking </v>

3229
02:41:24.470 --> 02:41:24.470
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is right above it.</v>

3230
02:41:24.470 --> 02:41:26.700
<v Speaker 1>That leg.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Read it yet right there.</v>

3231
02:41:26.760 --> 02:41:27.470
<v Speaker 1>Bam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3232
02:41:27.670 --> 02:41:29.070
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm also wrong.</v>

3233
02:41:29.071 --> 02:41:31.260
<v Speaker 1>Canadians didn't invent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was the other stuff.</v>

3234
02:41:31.320 --> 02:41:34.140
<v Speaker 1>The military.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Other than that did a bunch of stuff.</v>

3235
02:41:34.141 --> 02:41:37.620
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure I'll give you guys A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a fan of Canada,</v>

3236
02:41:37.621 --> 02:41:38.220
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love it.</v>

3237
02:41:38.460 --> 02:41:41.100
<v Speaker 1>I really do love Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you people up there just so much</v>

3238
02:41:41.101 --> 02:41:42.630
<v Speaker 1>nicer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's A.</v>

3239
02:41:42.630 --> 02:41:46.110
<v Speaker 1>I have struggled to try to figure out </v>
<v Speaker 1>why I've thought about it many,</v>

3240
02:41:46.111 --> 02:41:51.111
<v Speaker 1>many times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think people in general in Canada </v>

3241
02:41:51.111 --> 02:41:52.080
<v Speaker 1>or I always say there's 20 percent less </v>
<v Speaker 1>douchebags in Canada.</v>

3242
02:41:52.170 --> 02:41:54.000
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's assholes everywhere you </v>
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>

3243
02:41:54.001 --> 02:41:55.860
<v Speaker 1>but I feel like Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for whatever reason,</v>

3244
02:41:56.130 --> 02:41:57.480
<v Speaker 1>people were extremely polite.</v>

3245
02:41:57.810 --> 02:41:58.860
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

3246
02:41:58.970 --> 02:42:00.270
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3247
02:42:00.330 --> 02:42:01.410
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't see.</v>

3248
02:42:01.411 --> 02:42:06.411
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not convinced of it because I often </v>

3249
02:42:06.411 --> 02:42:06.411
<v Speaker 1>think the same thing when I come down to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the U.</v>

3250
02:42:06.411 --> 02:42:07.640
<v Speaker 1>S that people are more polite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that their.</v>

3251
02:42:08.040 --> 02:42:10.350
<v Speaker 1>That their level of customer service for</v>
<v Speaker 1>example,</v>

3252
02:42:11.310 --> 02:42:16.110
<v Speaker 1>but I think one of the differences </v>
<v Speaker 1>between Canada and the US is like all of</v>

3253
02:42:16.111 --> 02:42:19.470
<v Speaker 1>Canada in some senses like the midwest </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the United States,</v>

3254
02:42:19.800 --> 02:42:21.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we don't have this,</v>

3255
02:42:21.990 --> 02:42:26.220
<v Speaker 1>we don't have this extreme culture that </v>
<v Speaker 1>characterizes the us with the late great</v>

3256
02:42:26.221 --> 02:42:29.370
<v Speaker 1>lows and the great highs were all were </v>
<v Speaker 1>like elevator music,</v>

3257
02:42:29.860 --> 02:42:34.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>compared to a full symphony and there </v>

3258
02:42:34.860 --> 02:42:34.860
<v Speaker 1>can be some really tragic parts of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>symphony.</v>

3259
02:42:34.860 --> 02:42:39.591
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want peace order and good </v>

3260
02:42:39.591 --> 02:42:39.591
<v Speaker 1>government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's our constitutional credo.</v>

3261
02:42:39.591 --> 02:42:41.550
<v Speaker 1>Then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Canada's your place,</v>

3262
02:42:42.060 --> 02:42:47.060
<v Speaker 1>but it's a middle class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>middle of the road society and that has </v>

3263
02:42:47.060 --> 02:42:47.060
<v Speaker 1>some benefits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3264
02:42:47.060 --> 02:42:51.891
<v Speaker 1>it's nice and welcoming and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and not to experimental and kind of call</v>

3265
02:42:52.681 --> 02:42:55.200
<v Speaker 1>them insecure and those are good things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

3266
02:42:55.320 --> 02:42:58.560
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's a place that is great</v>
<v Speaker 1>at dealing with excellence,</v>

3267
02:42:58.950 --> 02:43:03.950
<v Speaker 1>but know that's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you feel like excellence is </v>

3268
02:43:03.950 --> 02:43:06.270
<v Speaker 1>suppressed because people don't like </v>
<v Speaker 1>when someone stands out too much?</v>

3269
02:43:06.450 --> 02:43:07.110
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

3270
02:43:07.510 --> 02:43:12.510
<v Speaker 1>Well I think that's true everywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's more true of Canada </v>

3271
02:43:12.510 --> 02:43:12.510
<v Speaker 1>than it is of us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think</v>

3272
02:43:12.510 --> 02:43:15.630
<v Speaker 2>it's celebrated a lot in the US.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3273
02:43:15.640 --> 02:43:17.830
<v Speaker 2>I think there's always going to be some </v>
<v Speaker 2>resistance,</v>

3274
02:43:17.831 --> 02:43:22.831
<v Speaker 2>especially from people that don't feel </v>
<v Speaker 2>like people always measure themselves </v>

3275
02:43:22.831 --> 02:43:25.840
<v Speaker 2>against someone if there's someone else </v>
<v Speaker 2>out there is just no some genius in some</v>

3276
02:43:25.841 --> 02:43:30.841
<v Speaker 2>form or another.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's always going to people that </v>

3277
02:43:30.841 --> 02:43:33.340
<v Speaker 2>people that measure themselves against </v>
<v Speaker 2>that person and find themselves coming </v>

3278
02:43:33.340 --> 02:43:34.960
<v Speaker 2>up short so they try to attack that </v>
<v Speaker 2>individual.</v>

3279
02:43:35.080 --> 02:43:38.170
<v Speaker 2>Someone who has just catastrophic </v>
<v Speaker 2>success and some sort of a way.</v>

3280
02:43:38.310 --> 02:43:43.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's another reason for the end for </v>

3281
02:43:43.310 --> 02:43:45.991
<v Speaker 2>people to be enemies of clear thought as</v>
<v Speaker 2>well because clear thought is a good </v>

3282
02:43:45.991 --> 02:43:49.690
<v Speaker 2>pathway to success and so if you could </v>
<v Speaker 2>go after people who think clearly,</v>

3283
02:43:49.691 --> 02:43:54.691
<v Speaker 2>it's another way of keeping the </v>
<v Speaker 2>dominance hierarchy nice and flat for </v>

3284
02:43:54.691 --> 02:43:54.910
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for your delectation let's say.</v>

3285
02:43:55.020 --> 02:44:00.020
<v Speaker 2>Mm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's the enemy of competence </v>

3286
02:44:00.020 --> 02:44:00.490
<v Speaker 2>element that I see as part of the social</v>
<v Speaker 2>justice warrior movement.</v>

3287
02:44:01.730 --> 02:44:06.730
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the extreme lack of financial </v>

3288
02:44:06.730 --> 02:44:08.950
<v Speaker 2>success and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and even creative success.</v>

3289
02:44:08.970 --> 02:44:10.990
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and even the insistence that hierarchies</v>

3290
02:44:10.991 --> 02:44:13.300
<v Speaker 2>are always based on power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like neuro.</v>

3291
02:44:13.301 --> 02:44:17.920
<v Speaker 2>The hierarchy of neurosurgeons is not </v>
<v Speaker 2>based on power or yet is obviously,</v>

3292
02:44:17.950 --> 02:44:22.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hierarchies are based to some degree on </v>

3293
02:44:22.950 --> 02:44:22.950
<v Speaker 2>power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't have to be juvenile about it,</v>

3294
02:44:22.950 --> 02:44:25.120
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the best neurosurgeons actually know how</v>

3295
02:44:25.121 --> 02:44:28.180
<v Speaker 2>to do surgery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not just a power thing,</v>

3296
02:44:28.250 --> 02:44:29.560
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The best farmer's Hay,</v>

3297
02:44:29.561 --> 02:44:33.310
<v Speaker 2>they grow food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's no,</v>

3298
02:44:33.340 --> 02:44:38.340
<v Speaker 2>there's no appreciation for actual the </v>
<v Speaker 2>real world while there's no real world </v>

3299
02:44:38.340 --> 02:44:38.950
<v Speaker 2>in postmodernism anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that doesn't matter,</v>

3300
02:44:38.951 --> 02:44:43.951
<v Speaker 2>but there's no appreciation for </v>
<v Speaker 2>competence or the fact that there's </v>

3301
02:44:43.951 --> 02:44:46.980
<v Speaker 2>individual difference in competence even</v>
<v Speaker 2>though they're always talking about </v>

3302
02:44:46.980 --> 02:44:50.071
<v Speaker 2>diversity and there's a downplaying of </v>
<v Speaker 2>competition and the importance of </v>

3303
02:44:50.071 --> 02:44:50.071
<v Speaker 2>competition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Definitely.</v>

3304
02:44:50.071 --> 02:44:50.530
<v Speaker 2>Oh yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

3305
02:44:50.531 --> 02:44:51.670
<v Speaker 2>Well that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

3306
02:44:51.671 --> 02:44:53.380
<v Speaker 2>and that's something that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly,</v>

3307
02:44:53.381 --> 02:44:56.680
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hard on men because men compete and they</v>

3308
02:44:56.681 --> 02:44:57.070
<v Speaker 2>compete.</v>

3309
02:44:57.070 --> 02:45:00.220
<v Speaker 2>Partly because women like winners.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's part of the reason.</v>

3310
02:45:00.580 --> 02:45:05.580
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you're shamed for that in this </v>

3311
02:45:05.580 --> 02:45:07.120
<v Speaker 2>postmodern view of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

3312
02:45:07.121 --> 02:45:09.400
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know the schools increasingly or non</v>

3313
02:45:09.410 --> 02:45:12.060
<v Speaker 2>competitive places.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like for a guy that means,</v>

3314
02:45:12.090 --> 02:45:17.090
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's tune out and go watch video games </v>

3315
02:45:17.090 --> 02:45:17.090
<v Speaker 2>because like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I can't win it this,</v>

3316
02:45:17.090 --> 02:45:19.000
<v Speaker 2>why should I play well to cooperate?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

3317
02:45:19.210 --> 02:45:20.260
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3318
02:45:20.830 --> 02:45:21.850
<v Speaker 2>fair enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

3319
02:45:21.851 --> 02:45:24.220
<v Speaker 2>but I'd actually like to try to win at </v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

3320
02:45:24.450 --> 02:45:25.990
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how evil can you get?</v>

3321
02:45:26.020 --> 02:45:27.940
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's toxic masculinity,</v>

3322
02:45:27.941 --> 02:45:31.420
<v Speaker 2>Jordan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That one drives me fucking crazy.</v>

3323
02:45:31.421 --> 02:45:34.480
<v Speaker 2>Like what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Toxic masculinity?</v>

3324
02:45:34.900 --> 02:45:39.900
<v Speaker 2>Toxic has an.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has nothing to do in masculine or </v>

3325
02:45:39.900 --> 02:45:39.900
<v Speaker 2>feminine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If something's toxic,</v>

3326
02:45:39.900 --> 02:45:42.100
<v Speaker 2>it's toxic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no toxic masculinity.</v>

3327
02:45:42.101 --> 02:45:44.510
<v Speaker 2>If someone's evil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they do something horrible.</v>

3328
02:45:44.511 --> 02:45:47.830
<v Speaker 2>If they're gingiss con or Adolf Hitler,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not toxic.</v>

3329
02:45:47.831 --> 02:45:52.831
<v Speaker 2>Masculinity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's an evil person has nothing to do </v>

3330
02:45:52.831 --> 02:45:52.831
<v Speaker 2>with the masculine and feminine.</v>

3331
02:45:53.080 --> 02:45:53.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3332
02:45:53.740 --> 02:45:55.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it depends on what your political agenda</v>

3333
02:45:55.491 --> 02:45:56.290
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3334
02:45:56.291 --> 02:46:01.291
<v Speaker 2>men are more likely to be the type of </v>
<v Speaker 2>person that does something awful in </v>

3335
02:46:01.291 --> 02:46:05.581
<v Speaker 2>terms of dominating or war or violence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's almost in our nature in some way </v>

3336
02:46:07.211 --> 02:46:09.020
<v Speaker 2>because of all the things that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>discussed before,</v>

3337
02:46:09.140 --> 02:46:11.660
<v Speaker 2>we're more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're more likely to do something that's</v>

3338
02:46:11.661 --> 02:46:16.661
<v Speaker 2>really evident.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's plenty of bullying that goes on </v>

3339
02:46:16.661 --> 02:46:20.261
<v Speaker 2>behind the scenes among women are </v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely know it can manifest itself </v>

3340
02:46:20.261 --> 02:46:24.041
<v Speaker 2>in naked physical aggression and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually think that's hard on women in </v>

3341
02:46:24.041 --> 02:46:24.041
<v Speaker 2>some ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean my,</v>

3342
02:46:24.041 --> 02:46:28.380
<v Speaker 2>my daughter for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is always mad at my son because like not</v>

3343
02:46:29.481 --> 02:46:31.140
<v Speaker 2>chronically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

3344
02:46:31.160 --> 02:46:36.160
<v Speaker 2>he'd have a dispute with one of his </v>
<v Speaker 2>friends and maybe it would get physical </v>

3345
02:46:36.160 --> 02:46:38.120
<v Speaker 2>and then that'd be the end of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'd be friends again,</v>

3346
02:46:38.510 --> 02:46:39.090
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a way,</v>

3347
02:46:39.140 --> 02:46:44.140
<v Speaker 2>there is a way of bringing it to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>conclusion and without that then things </v>

3348
02:46:44.140 --> 02:46:46.850
<v Speaker 2>can smolder on forever and that's really</v>
<v Speaker 2>rough.</v>

3349
02:46:46.880 --> 02:46:48.170
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some.</v>

3350
02:46:48.230 --> 02:46:53.050
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes the simplest solution is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight often and you know,</v>

3351
02:46:53.420 --> 02:46:57.020
<v Speaker 2>I'm not that deep so I know what you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying.</v>

3352
02:46:57.080 --> 02:47:02.080
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm embarrassed that I would even </v>

3353
02:47:02.080 --> 02:47:03.790
<v Speaker 2>think that I have to put some little </v>
<v Speaker 2>quote marks around your documented </v>

3354
02:47:04.221 --> 02:47:06.860
<v Speaker 2>developing person to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're talking about young people.</v>

3355
02:47:06.970 --> 02:47:08.810
<v Speaker 2>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is an issue,</v>

3356
02:47:08.811 --> 02:47:13.811
<v Speaker 2>this simmering and stewing of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of disputes where they never come to a </v>

3357
02:47:13.811 --> 02:47:14.870
<v Speaker 2>head and they never get resolved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3358
02:47:14.871 --> 02:47:16.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a terrible thing.</v>

3359
02:47:16.340 --> 02:47:20.090
<v Speaker 2>Terrible thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's part of hell for sure to have these</v>

3360
02:47:20.091 --> 02:47:23.300
<v Speaker 2>things that are just grinding away at </v>
<v Speaker 2>you all the time.</v>

3361
02:47:23.430 --> 02:47:24.230
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not.</v>

3362
02:47:24.770 --> 02:47:27.530
<v Speaker 2>It's definitely not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not a good place to be in.</v>

3363
02:47:27.531 --> 02:47:29.840
<v Speaker 2>Good motivations don't come out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's for sure.</v>

3364
02:47:31.190 --> 02:47:34.430
<v Speaker 2>You've made some some statements and </v>
<v Speaker 2>we've had some.</v>

3365
02:47:34.850 --> 02:47:39.850
<v Speaker 2>You've had some conversations about your</v>
<v Speaker 2>role in academia and that you might not </v>

3366
02:47:41.330 --> 02:47:44.540
<v Speaker 2>necessarily be unstructured academia </v>
<v Speaker 2>forever,</v>

3367
02:47:44.541 --> 02:47:47.600
<v Speaker 2>that this might be an issue like that.</v>

3368
02:47:47.600 --> 02:47:50.600
<v Speaker 2>This is coming to a head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You feel that way now?</v>

3369
02:47:50.750 --> 02:47:51.950
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the university,</v>

3370
02:47:52.040 --> 02:47:57.040
<v Speaker 2>I think what happened was the university</v>
<v Speaker 2>reacted towards me because a bunch of </v>

3371
02:47:57.531 --> 02:48:02.531
<v Speaker 2>people got irritated and organized and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you know when they're irritated way and </v>

3372
02:48:02.531 --> 02:48:07.121
<v Speaker 2>said that I was a bad person and </v>
<v Speaker 2>something should be done about me and </v>

3373
02:48:07.121 --> 02:48:10.481
<v Speaker 2>there was enough of them so the </v>
<v Speaker 2>university thought they needed to react </v>

3374
02:48:10.481 --> 02:48:13.781
<v Speaker 2>to that pressure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a charitable way of interpreting </v>

3375
02:48:13.781 --> 02:48:17.741
<v Speaker 2>it but reasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then a bunch of people wrote the </v>

3376
02:48:17.741 --> 02:48:18.350
<v Speaker 2>university and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait a second,</v>

3377
02:48:18.650 --> 02:48:22.430
<v Speaker 2>I agree with what that guy's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should leave them alone and not only</v>

3378
02:48:22.970 --> 02:48:27.970
<v Speaker 2>people from the general populace,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but soon after I posted the original </v>

3379
02:48:27.970 --> 02:48:31.721
<v Speaker 2>videos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the press was kind of a bivalent </v>

3380
02:48:31.721 --> 02:48:33.240
<v Speaker 2>about me for awhile in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the first two weeks or three weeks,</v>

3381
02:48:33.241 --> 02:48:38.241
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after I released those videos and there </v>

3382
02:48:38.241 --> 02:48:40.001
<v Speaker 2>were the protests,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then they started to look into what </v>

3383
02:48:40.001 --> 02:48:40.001
<v Speaker 2>I was doing and they thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

3384
02:48:40.001 --> 02:48:40.001
<v Speaker 2>it turns out that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3385
02:48:40.520 --> 02:48:44.240
<v Speaker 2>freedom of speech actually happens to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>quite important to journalists to.</v>

3386
02:48:44.520 --> 02:48:49.310
<v Speaker 2>And they came out like really radically </v>
<v Speaker 2>in support of me,</v>

3387
02:48:49.311 --> 02:48:52.000
<v Speaker 2>some of the major journalists in Canada </v>
<v Speaker 2>and a whole,</v>

3388
02:48:52.070 --> 02:48:57.070
<v Speaker 2>the whole post media system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was about a hundred and 50 or 200 </v>

3389
02:48:57.070 --> 02:49:00.851
<v Speaker 2>newspapers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the university had a reason to </v>

3390
02:49:00.851 --> 02:49:03.230
<v Speaker 2>back off and maybe they were happy to </v>
<v Speaker 2>back off.</v>

3391
02:49:03.231 --> 02:49:05.300
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Dean I was negotiating was,</v>

3392
02:49:05.360 --> 02:49:06.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he wasn't a bad guy.</v>

3393
02:49:07.260 --> 02:49:12.260
<v Speaker 2>He was an older guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he's in his seventies and </v>

3394
02:49:12.260 --> 02:49:12.480
<v Speaker 2>responding to pressure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't want a bunch of trouble and,</v>

3395
02:49:13.360 --> 02:49:17.200
<v Speaker 2>and he wanted the problem to go away </v>
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>

3396
02:49:17.220 --> 02:49:19.770
<v Speaker 2>And that's what you do want for problems</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do.</v>

3397
02:49:19.771 --> 02:49:24.771
<v Speaker 2>But anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all this public support I got gave the </v>

3398
02:49:24.771 --> 02:49:26.100
<v Speaker 2>university a reason to leave me the hell</v>
<v Speaker 2>alone,</v>

3399
02:49:26.101 --> 02:49:31.101
<v Speaker 2>so they decided to do that and partly I </v>
<v Speaker 2>suppose I was always reasonable during </v>

3400
02:49:31.101 --> 02:49:33.570
<v Speaker 2>the negotiations because I'm a </v>
<v Speaker 2>reasonable person and so,</v>

3401
02:49:34.340 --> 02:49:39.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they met me they realized that I </v>

3402
02:49:39.340 --> 02:49:40.230
<v Speaker 2>wasn't the particular kind of monster </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I had been accused of being.</v>

3403
02:49:41.020 --> 02:49:44.670
<v Speaker 2>And so the university has left me off </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then so I was,</v>

3404
02:49:44.730 --> 02:49:49.730
<v Speaker 2>I had a health crisis in December that </v>
<v Speaker 2>more or less rectified itself by the </v>

3405
02:49:50.970 --> 02:49:55.970
<v Speaker 2>beginning of January,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I wasn't sure that plus what had </v>

3406
02:49:55.970 --> 02:49:57.480
<v Speaker 2>happened to me because of these videos </v>
<v Speaker 2>and all the crazy response to them.</v>

3407
02:49:57.800 --> 02:50:02.800
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't sure I was in a sufficiently </v>

3408
02:50:02.800 --> 02:50:04.380
<v Speaker 2>together position to go back lecturing </v>
<v Speaker 2>in January.</v>

3409
02:50:04.500 --> 02:50:07.380
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even know for a while until </v>
<v Speaker 2>December if I was going to be,</v>

3410
02:50:07.470 --> 02:50:09.600
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>allowed to continue to lecture.</v>

3411
02:50:09.690 --> 02:50:14.690
<v Speaker 2>So it's very uncertain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I decided that it was better to get </v>

3412
02:50:14.690 --> 02:50:16.080
<v Speaker 2>back on the horse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so to speak.</v>

3413
02:50:16.320 --> 02:50:20.370
<v Speaker 2>And so I started lecturing and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>students were very welcoming.</v>

3414
02:50:20.910 --> 02:50:25.910
<v Speaker 2>So thank God for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is it like now when you're in </v>

3415
02:50:25.910 --> 02:50:28.461
<v Speaker 2>school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that a completely different </v>

3416
02:50:28.461 --> 02:50:28.461
<v Speaker 2>experience and before your notoriety </v>
<v Speaker 2>exploded?</v>

3417
02:50:29.430 --> 02:50:34.430
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's lots of things that are </v>

3418
02:50:34.430 --> 02:50:34.430
<v Speaker 2>different about it.</v>

3419
02:50:34.430 --> 02:50:34.430
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

3420
02:50:34.430 --> 02:50:37.940
<v Speaker 2>lots of students,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are lots of people who come to my </v>

3421
02:50:37.940 --> 02:50:40.371
<v Speaker 2>classes just to sit in the classes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's people who are stopping me all </v>

3422
02:50:40.371 --> 02:50:44.241
<v Speaker 2>the time in the hallways and wanting to </v>
<v Speaker 2>introduce themselves and that happens a </v>

3423
02:50:44.241 --> 02:50:45.310
<v Speaker 2>lot in public and in the strangest </v>
<v Speaker 2>situation.</v>

3424
02:50:45.311 --> 02:50:48.080
<v Speaker 2>So I'm rather unused to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3425
02:50:49.020 --> 02:50:50.730
<v Speaker 2>the feeling at the university.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3426
02:50:51.210 --> 02:50:56.210
<v Speaker 2>I haven't processed any of that yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I would say I'm about seven </v>

3427
02:50:56.210 --> 02:50:57.720
<v Speaker 2>months behind in my understanding of my </v>
<v Speaker 2>own life.</v>

3428
02:50:58.190 --> 02:50:59.940
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because things happen.</v>

3429
02:50:59.941 --> 02:51:04.941
<v Speaker 2>So many things happened from September </v>
<v Speaker 2>to now that I haven't had time to think </v>

3430
02:51:06.391 --> 02:51:07.840
<v Speaker 2>about any of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3431
02:51:07.850 --> 02:51:10.590
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's been a continual,</v>

3432
02:51:11.220 --> 02:51:15.660
<v Speaker 2>an absolutely continual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3433
02:51:15.900 --> 02:51:20.900
<v Speaker 2>treadmill of trying to keep up with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>requests for speaking and the email.</v>

3434
02:51:23.131 --> 02:51:23.660
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm,</v>

3435
02:51:23.770 --> 02:51:28.770
<v Speaker 2>I'm supposed to be making these youtube </v>
<v Speaker 2>videos because I have people who are </v>

3436
02:51:28.770 --> 02:51:28.770
<v Speaker 2>supporting me for doing that.</v>

3437
02:51:28.770 --> 02:51:33.140
<v Speaker 2>So I'm trying to keep that up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I'm trying to go speak when </v>

3438
02:51:33.140 --> 02:51:36.981
<v Speaker 2>people invite me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not all the time because of course </v>

3439
02:51:36.981 --> 02:51:38.220
<v Speaker 2>that's a lot of travel and so I'm trying</v>
<v Speaker 2>to recalibrate my life.</v>

3440
02:51:38.221 --> 02:51:39.240
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to figure out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

3441
02:51:39.241 --> 02:51:44.241
<v Speaker 2>I've got 10 million views on youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well what am I supposed to do with that </v>

3442
02:51:44.241 --> 02:51:45.990
<v Speaker 2>piece of information?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got 250,000</v>

3443
02:51:46.770 --> 02:51:49.320
<v Speaker 2>subscribers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what is,</v>

3444
02:51:49.470 --> 02:51:50.810
<v Speaker 2>what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>

3445
02:51:50.930 --> 02:51:52.440
<v Speaker 2>what does that mean for what I should be</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing?</v>

3446
02:51:52.441 --> 02:51:55.140
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I should be doing nothing but </v>
<v Speaker 2>making youtube videos for them.</v>

3447
02:51:55.560 --> 02:51:57.700
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a tremendous violence.</v>

3448
02:51:57.870 --> 02:51:59.560
<v Speaker 2>It's unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's,</v>

3449
02:51:59.700 --> 02:52:01.230
<v Speaker 2>it's unparalleled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3450
02:52:01.231 --> 02:52:06.231
<v Speaker 2>Just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean think about it from in terms of </v>

3451
02:52:06.231 --> 02:52:06.231
<v Speaker 2>is there any other academic that has </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever</v>

3452
02:52:06.231 --> 02:52:09.760
<v Speaker 3>done anything remotely like that where </v>
<v Speaker 3>you have 250,000</v>

3453
02:52:09.761 --> 02:52:14.761
<v Speaker 3>subscribers on youtube in a relatively </v>
<v Speaker 3>short amount of time and then millions </v>

3454
02:52:15.070 --> 02:52:15.540
<v Speaker 3>and millions of views on your video?</v>

3455
02:52:15.730 --> 02:52:16.540
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

3456
02:52:16.890 --> 02:52:19.750
<v Speaker 2>I mean well it's ill defined territory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3457
02:52:19.751 --> 02:52:23.540
<v Speaker 2>Because who knows what youtube is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean your,</v>

3458
02:52:23.650 --> 02:52:28.650
<v Speaker 2>your presence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what you make of your </v>

3459
02:52:28.650 --> 02:52:28.650
<v Speaker 2>presence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3460
02:52:28.650 --> 02:52:32.410
<v Speaker 2>you told me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that you're getting something </v>

3461
02:52:32.410 --> 02:52:33.340
<v Speaker 2>like 70 million downloads a month.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's more than like 120 now.</v>

3462
02:52:33.400 --> 02:52:38.400
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're getting a billion downloads a </v>

3463
02:52:38.400 --> 02:52:38.510
<v Speaker 2>year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

3464
02:52:38.930 --> 02:52:40.260
<v Speaker 2>More than that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what?</v>

3465
02:52:41.660 --> 02:52:42.200
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3466
02:52:42.360 --> 02:52:43.970
<v Speaker 2>So what the hell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I could ask you,</v>

3467
02:52:43.971 --> 02:52:46.170
<v Speaker 2>what do you make of that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like are you the,</v>

3468
02:52:46.180 --> 02:52:51.180
<v Speaker 2>are you the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you the most powerful interview or </v>

3469
02:52:51.180 --> 02:52:53.771
<v Speaker 2>on the planet or are you the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>powerful interview that the planet has </v>

3470
02:52:53.771 --> 02:52:54.830
<v Speaker 2>ever seen because it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3471
02:52:55.490 --> 02:53:00.230
<v Speaker 2>the numbers would suggest so nobody's </v>
<v Speaker 2>had who has a billion of anything.</v>

3472
02:53:01.610 --> 02:53:02.150
<v Speaker 6>No one,</v>

3473
02:53:03.240 --> 02:53:04.510
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's never happened.</v>

3474
02:53:05.230 --> 02:53:10.230
<v Speaker 2>So what the hell?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what are you doing and why is it </v>

3475
02:53:10.230 --> 02:53:10.230
<v Speaker 2>working and where are all these people?</v>

3476
02:53:10.230 --> 02:53:10.950
<v Speaker 3>God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3477
02:53:10.951 --> 02:53:13.980
<v Speaker 3>what I do is just keep doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's all I do.</v>

3478
02:53:14.160 --> 02:53:16.860
<v Speaker 3>I just do what I do and I don't think </v>
<v Speaker 3>too much about it.</v>

3479
02:53:16.950 --> 02:53:21.950
<v Speaker 3>I enjoy it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I try to talk to people like yourself </v>

3480
02:53:21.950 --> 02:53:24.141
<v Speaker 3>that I really enjoy talking to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or the guy before you was a bow hunter,</v>

3481
02:53:25.110 --> 02:53:27.420
<v Speaker 3>which I enjoy talking to him two very </v>
<v Speaker 3>different.</v>

3482
02:53:27.421 --> 02:53:28.890
<v Speaker 3>Very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very different conversation.</v>

3483
02:53:29.220 --> 02:53:33.710
<v Speaker 3>Tomorrow I'm talking about a guy who's a</v>
<v Speaker 3>debunker or talking to a guy who's a.</v>

3484
02:53:33.810 --> 02:53:38.810
<v Speaker 3>He runs a site called metabolic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to talk about people that </v>

3485
02:53:38.810 --> 02:53:39.470
<v Speaker 3>believe the earth is flat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Literally,</v>

3486
02:53:39.530 --> 02:53:44.530
<v Speaker 3>we're going to spend about two hours </v>
<v Speaker 3>debunking the flat earth theory that is </v>

3487
02:53:44.560 --> 02:53:49.560
<v Speaker 3>all over the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you realize I've seen </v>

3488
02:53:49.560 --> 02:53:52.220
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is a rabid anti intellectual vibe </v>

3489
02:53:53.700 --> 02:53:57.110
<v Speaker 3>that's going on today and this is flat.</v>

3490
02:53:57.900 --> 02:54:02.900
<v Speaker 2>No wonder you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's no wonder because the many of the </v>

3491
02:54:02.900 --> 02:54:05.280
<v Speaker 2>prominent intellectual types have become</v>
<v Speaker 2>prisoners of their own imagination.</v>

3492
02:54:06.060 --> 02:54:07.060
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>

3493
02:54:07.290 --> 02:54:10.780
<v Speaker 2>This is partly what breeds that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That terror of intellectual ism.</v>

3494
02:54:11.060 --> 02:54:16.060
<v Speaker 2>There's something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's something about it that's we </v>

3495
02:54:16.060 --> 02:54:17.100
<v Speaker 2>don't want to get too far away from our </v>
<v Speaker 2>bodies.</v>

3496
02:54:18.060 --> 02:54:20.040
<v Speaker 2>We don't want to get too far away from </v>
<v Speaker 2>her souls.</v>

3497
02:54:20.041 --> 02:54:22.070
<v Speaker 2>That's another way of thinking about it </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

3498
02:54:22.071 --> 02:54:27.071
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is this idea that as I said </v>

3499
02:54:27.071 --> 02:54:29.721
<v Speaker 2>before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the Catholics always warned about </v>

3500
02:54:29.721 --> 02:54:32.481
<v Speaker 2>is that the rational mind falls in love </v>
<v Speaker 2>with its own productions or even more </v>

3501
02:54:32.481 --> 02:54:35.781
<v Speaker 2>that it tries to elevate its productions</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the status of God and that's,</v>

3502
02:54:35.881 --> 02:54:40.881
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's really what Milton was warning </v>

3503
02:54:40.881 --> 02:54:40.881
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least in some sense in his book,</v>

3504
02:54:40.881 --> 02:54:41.900
<v Speaker 2>Paradise lost.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3505
02:54:42.000 --> 02:54:45.900
<v Speaker 2>these utopias are human creations and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then people fall prey to them.</v>

3506
02:54:45.901 --> 02:54:50.070
<v Speaker 2>It's like idol worship really is very </v>
<v Speaker 2>much like idol worship and,</v>

3507
02:54:50.110 --> 02:54:55.110
<v Speaker 2>and it's no wonder people get skeptical </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the intellectuals because they're </v>

3508
02:54:55.110 --> 02:54:58.830
<v Speaker 2>producing these utopias that are fake </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they inhabit.</v>

3509
02:54:58.831 --> 02:55:02.130
<v Speaker 2>They're almost like the abstract </v>
<v Speaker 2>equivalent of video games.</v>

3510
02:55:02.720 --> 02:55:04.040
<v Speaker 2>You soul.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I</v>

3511
02:55:04.040 --> 02:55:09.040
<v Speaker 1>think you're right about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I also think there's something else </v>

3512
02:55:09.040 --> 02:55:11.171
<v Speaker 1>going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think people are aware of this chaos </v>

3513
02:55:11.171 --> 02:55:14.861
<v Speaker 1>that we described earlier and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrified and they're cleaning to </v>

3514
02:55:14.861 --> 02:55:17.981
<v Speaker 1>nonsense because of that terror and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're embedding themselves in these </v>

3515
02:55:18.201 --> 02:55:20.240
<v Speaker 1>fruitless pursuits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chasing their own tail.</v>

3516
02:55:20.300 --> 02:55:20.850
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

3517
02:55:20.851 --> 02:55:23.720
<v Speaker 1>I'm on board with that man that chasing </v>
<v Speaker 1>your own tail.</v>

3518
02:55:23.870 --> 02:55:28.870
<v Speaker 1>That's a symbol of chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chaos is the dragon that eats its own </v>

3519
02:55:28.870 --> 02:55:32.591
<v Speaker 1>tail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that came spontaneously to mind when </v>

3520
02:55:32.591 --> 02:55:33.800
<v Speaker 1>you thought about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's a downward spiral man.</v>

3521
02:55:34.420 --> 02:55:36.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the thing is is that as you,</v>

3522
02:55:36.710 --> 02:55:39.830
<v Speaker 1>as you retreat from the chaos into your </v>
<v Speaker 1>own little prison,</v>

3523
02:55:40.280 --> 02:55:45.280
<v Speaker 1>you get weaker and weaker and the prison</v>
<v Speaker 1>gets smaller and smaller and the chaos </v>

3524
02:55:45.280 --> 02:55:48.761
<v Speaker 1>gets bigger and bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really an ugly pathway and you get </v>

3525
02:55:48.761 --> 02:55:52.241
<v Speaker 1>more and more bitter and resentful and </v>
<v Speaker 1>much more afraid of having your prison </v>

3526
02:55:52.241 --> 02:55:52.241
<v Speaker 1>walls breached.</v>

3527
02:55:52.370 --> 02:55:57.370
<v Speaker 1>It's a downward spiral and much less </v>
<v Speaker 1>interested in pursuing the truth or any </v>

3528
02:55:57.621 --> 02:56:02.621
<v Speaker 1>sort of objective reasoning and much </v>
<v Speaker 1>more interested in confirmation bias to </v>

3529
02:56:04.281 --> 02:56:05.270
<v Speaker 1>the extreme.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

3530
02:56:05.450 --> 02:56:10.450
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I detailed out that process in my book </v>

3531
02:56:10.450 --> 02:56:13.920
<v Speaker 1>maps of meaning exactly that it's this </v>
<v Speaker 1>feedback loop pay because you,</v>

3532
02:56:14.320 --> 02:56:17.330
<v Speaker 1>the weaker you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thicker the walls have to be,</v>

3533
02:56:17.600 --> 02:56:22.600
<v Speaker 1>but the thick you make the walls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the less challenge you face in the </v>

3534
02:56:22.600 --> 02:56:27.071
<v Speaker 1>weaker you get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so then the walls have to get thicker </v>

3535
02:56:27.071 --> 02:56:29.231
<v Speaker 1>and then you get weaker and the walls </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to get thicker and it's not a </v>

3536
02:56:29.231 --> 02:56:29.630
<v Speaker 1>pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a pretty picture man.</v>

3537
02:56:30.800 --> 02:56:33.700
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

3538
02:56:34.310 --> 02:56:35.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I think too.</v>

3539
02:56:35.930 --> 02:56:37.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because.</v>

3540
02:56:37.520 --> 02:56:42.110
<v Speaker 1>And on that note we just to three hours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we just did it.</v>

3541
02:56:42.300 --> 02:56:43.970
<v Speaker 1>This is my favorite podcasts of all </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

3542
02:56:44.240 --> 02:56:45.320
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just want to tell Ya.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I could I say it was my favorite podcast</v>

3545
02:56:49.671 --> 02:56:54.671
<v Speaker 1>of all time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a much smaller domain of podcast </v>

3546
02:56:54.671 --> 02:56:55.520
<v Speaker 1>comparisons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we did.</v>

3547
02:56:55.960 --> 02:56:58.130
<v Speaker 1>This is like number 900 and what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is it?</v>

3548
02:56:59.300 --> 02:57:04.300
<v Speaker 1>Nine hundred 58.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you touched on some things that </v>

3549
02:57:04.300 --> 02:57:06.560
<v Speaker 1>made me think in a very unique way </v>

<v Speaker 1>so thank you very much for that.</v>

<v Speaker 1>to my presence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so whatever comes of that is to be </v>
